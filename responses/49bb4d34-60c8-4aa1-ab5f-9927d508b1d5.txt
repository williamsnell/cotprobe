Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about half-cell potentials. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question gives me a reaction and the half-cell potential, and I need to find the activity of H+ ions. 

The reaction given is O2(g) + 4H+(aq) + 4e^- → 2H2O(l), and the half-cell potential is +1.03 V at 298.15 K when the activity of O2 is 1.00. I need to find the activity of H+.

Alright, I remember that the Nernst equation relates the half-cell potential to the standard potential and the activities (or concentrations) of the reactants and products. The general form is E = E° - (RT/nF) ln(Q), but I think it's often written as E = E° + (0.05916 V/n) log(Q) at 25°C, which is 298.15 K. So maybe I can use that version since the temperature is given as 298.15 K.

Wait, but actually, the standard Nernst equation is E = E° + (0.05916/n) * log(Q) when the temperature is 25°C, which is the same as 298.15 K. So that should be applicable here.

Wait, but wait, let me confirm. The Nernst equation is E = E° - (RT/nF) ln(Q), and when T is 298 K (25°C), R is 8.314 J/mol·K, F is 96485 C/mol, so RT/F is (8.314 * 298)/96485 ≈ 0.02569 V. But when using log base 10, the equation becomes E = E° + (0.05916 V/n) * log(Q), because ln(Q) = 2.303 log(Q), so (RT/nF) ln(Q) = (0.02569 * 2.303/n) * log(Q) ≈ (0.05916/n) log(Q). So yes, the equation E = E° + (0.05916/n) log(Q) is correct at 25°C.

So the first thing I need to do is write the expression for Q, the reaction quotient. For the reaction O2 + 4H+ + 4e^- → 2H2O, the species are O2 (gas), H+ (aqueous), and H2O (liquid). Since pure liquids have an activity of 1, H2O(l) doesn't appear in Q. So Q is [H+]^4 / (P_O2), because O2 is a gas and its activity is its partial pressure. 

Wait, but in the reaction, O2 is consumed, H+ is consumed, and H2O is produced. So the reaction quotient Q is [products]/[reactants], but since H2O is a liquid, it's excluded. So Q would be [H+]^4 / (P_O2). 

But wait, in the Nernst equation, for a reduction reaction, E is measured as the potential under non-standard conditions. The general form is E = E° + (0.05916/n) * log(Q), where Q is the reaction quotient for the reduction as written.

Wait, in the standard notation, the reaction is written as a reduction. So the given reaction is a reduction: O2 is being reduced to H2O. So the Nernst equation would be E = E° + (0.05916/n) * log(Q), where Q is as I wrote: [H+]^4 / (P_O2).

Wait, but wait: in the Nernst equation, the reaction is written as products on the right. So the general form is aA + bB → cC + dD, and Q is [C]^c [D]^d / ([A]^a [B]^b). So in this case, the products are 2H2O, but it's liquid, so not in Q. The reactants are O2 (g) and H+ (aq). So Q = 1 / (P_O2 * [H+]^4 ), wait no, because the reaction is O2 + 4H+ → 2H2O. So products are H2O, which is liquid; the reactants are O2 (g) and H+ (aq). So the reaction quotient Q is [products]/[reactants], but since H2O is a liquid, it's 1. So Q = 1 / (P_O2 * [H+]^4 ). Wait, no, because the reaction is written as O2 + 4H+ + 4e^- → 2H2O. So as a reduction, the reaction is O2 being reduced to H2O. So the products are H2O, and the reactants are O2 and H+. So Q is [H2O]^2 / ([O2] * [H+]^4 ). But since H2O is a pure liquid, [H2O] is 1, so Q = 1 / (P_O2 * [H+]^4 ). Because O2 is a gas, so its activity is its partial pressure, which is given as a_O2 = 1.00. 

Wait, but wait, in the Nernst equation, when you have a reaction written as a reduction (as it is here), the equation is:

E = E° + (0.05916 V / n) * log(Q), where Q is the reaction quotient for the reduction as written. So for the reaction O2 + 4H+ + 4e^- → 2H2O, the reaction quotient Q is [H2O]^2 / ([O2][H+]^4). But since [H2O] is a pure liquid, it's 1. So Q = 1 / ([O2][H+]^4 ). 

But wait, in the standard form, the reaction quotient is [products]/[reactants], but H2O is a product. So for the reaction, the products are H2O, and the reactants are O2 and H+. So Q = [H2O]^2 / ([O2][H+]^4 ). Since [H2O] is 1, Q = 1/([O2][H+]^4 ). 

But wait, wait again. Alternatively, sometimes the reaction is written as a reduction, and sometimes as an oxidation. Let me make sure I have the correct expression. The given reaction is a reduction because O2 is being reduced to H2O. So the Nernst equation considers the reaction as written.

So E = E° + (0.05916/n) * log(Q), where Q is as above. 

Now, given that, the problem states that E is +1.03 V when a_O2 = 1.00. So I can plug that into the equation to solve for [H+].

Wait, but wait: what is E° for this reaction? I think I might have to look it up or recall it. Alternatively, maybe the standard potential is given, but looking again at the problem, it says the half-cell potential is +1.03 V under the conditions given. Wait, no, actually, the problem says the half-cell potential for the reaction is +1.03 V when a_O2 is 1.00. So that would be the standard potential, because under standard conditions, all activities are 1. Wait, but in this case, a_O2 is 1.00, but what about [H+]? Because under standard conditions, [H+] is 1 M. So perhaps when a_O2 is 1.00 and [H+] is 1 M, the potential is E°. But in this problem, [H+] is not 1 M, so we're using the Nernst equation to find [H+] when E is +1.03 V.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the half-cell potential is +1.03 V when a_O2 = 1.00. So perhaps E is 1.03 V under the given conditions, and that's not necessarily the standard potential. Wait, but the standard potential for this reaction is usually known. Let me think: for the oxygen reduction reaction, O2 + 4H+ + 4e^- → 2H2O, the standard potential E° is +1.23 V. Oh right, that's the standard electrode potential for this reaction. So perhaps the problem is giving me E under non-standard conditions, and I have to find [H+].

Wait, that makes more sense. So if the standard potential E° is +1.23 V, and under the given conditions, the potential E is +1.03 V, which is lower than E°. That would mean the reaction is less spontaneous under these conditions. So using the Nernst equation, E = E° + (0.05916/n) * log(Q), and we can solve for Q, which depends on [H+] and a_O2.

Wait, but in the problem, a_O2 is given as 1.00, so that's P_O2 in atm (assuming standard pressure). So with that, and knowing E is 1.03 V, I can plug into the equation to find [H+].

Let me write down the equation:

E = E° + (0.05916/n) * log(Q)

Given E = 1.03 V, E° = 1.23 V, n is the number of electrons transferred, which is 4.

So:

1.03 = 1.23 + (0.05916/4) * log(Q)

Simplify:

1.03 - 1.23 = (0.05916/4) * log(Q)

-0.20 = (0.01479) * log(Q)

So log(Q) = (-0.20) / 0.01479 ≈ -13.46

So Q = 10^(-13.46) ≈ 3.47 × 10^-14.

Wait, but Q is [H+]^4 / (P_O2), but wait no: earlier I thought Q is 1/(P_O2 [H+]^4 ), because the reaction is O2 + 4H+ → 2H2O. So Q = 1/(P_O2 [H+]^4 ). But wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-derive Q.

The reaction is O2(g) + 4H+(aq) + 4e^- → 2H2O(l). The reaction quotient Q is [products]^coefficients / [reactants]^coefficients. The products are H2O, which is liquid, so activity is 1. The reactants are O2 (gas) and H+ (aq). So Q = (1) / ( (P_O2) * [H+]^4 )

So Q = 1/(P_O2 [H+]^4 )

But in the problem, P_O2 is given as a_O2 = 1.00, which I think refers to the partial pressure of O2 being 1 atm. So a_O2 = P_O2 / P°, where P° is 1 atm. So P_O2 = 1.00 atm.

So Q = 1/(1.00 * [H+]^4 ) = 1/[H+]^4

So Q = 1/[H+]^4.

But earlier I found that Q ≈ 3.47 × 10^-14. So:

1/[H+]^4 = 3.47 × 10^-14

Taking reciprocal:

[H+]^4 = 1/(3.47 × 10^-14) ≈ 2.878 × 10^13

Taking the fourth root:

[H+] = (2.878 × 10^13)^(1/4)

Let me calculate that. Let's compute the logarithm to make it easier.

log(2.878 × 10^13) = log(2.878) + 13 ≈ 0.4582 +13 = 13.4582

Divide by 4: 13.4582 /4 ≈ 3.36455

So [H+] = 10^3.36455 ≈ 10^0.36455 * 10^3.

10^0.36455 ≈ 2.29 (since 10^0.3645 is about 2.29). So [H+] ≈ 2.29 × 10^3 M.

Wait, that can't be right. Because 2.29e3 M is extremely high concentration, like over 2000 M H+, which is impossible. So I must have made a mistake in calculating Q. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, let's go back. The equation after substitution was:

1.03 = 1.23 + (0.05916/4) * log(Q)

So 1.03 - 1.23 = (0.01479) * log(Q)

-0.20 = 0.01479 * log(Q)

So log(Q) = -0.20 / 0.01479 ≈ -13.46.

Wait, but if Q is 1/[H+]^4, and log(Q) is -13.46, then:

Q = 10^(-13.46) ≈ 3.47 × 10^-14.

So 1/[H+]^4 ≈ 3.47e-14 → [H+]^4 ≈ 1/(3.47e-14) ≈ 2.878e13.

Wait, that's correct, but the fourth root is (2.878e13)^(1/4). Let me compute that more accurately.

Let me compute 2.878e13 to the 1/4 power.

We can write 2.878e13 as 2.878 × 10^13.

Take the logarithm base 10 of 2.878e13: log10(2.878e13) = log10(2.878) + 13 ≈ 0.4582 +13 = 13.4582.

Divide by 4: 13.4582/4 ≈ 3.36455.

So 10^3.36455 ≈ 10^3 * 10^0.36455.

10^3 is 1000.

10^0.36455: Let's compute it.

We know that 10^0.3 ≈ 2, 10^0.3010 ≈ 2, because log10(2) ≈0.3010.

0.36455 is about 0.36455. Let's compute 10^0.36455.

Using linear approximation: between 0.3010 (2) and 0.4771 (3).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use natural logs.

Alternatively, I can compute 10^0.36455 ≈ e^(0.36455 * ln(10)).

ln(10) ≈ 2.3026, so 0.36455 * 2.3026 ≈ 0.839.

e^0.839 ≈ 2.316.

So 10^0.36455 ≈ 2.316.

So [H+] ≈ 1000 * 2.316 ≈ 2316 M.

That seems way too high. H+ concentration of 2316 M is not possible in reality. So I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the Nernst equation sign. Let me double-check the reaction and the direction.

The reaction is O2 + 4H+ + 4e^- → 2H2O. That's a reduction, so E is given as +1.03 V, and E° is +1.23 V. So since E is less than E°, the reaction is less spontaneous, which would mean that the cell is not as oxidizing as under standard conditions, which makes sense.

Wait, but let's check the calculation again. Let me go through it step by step.

E = E° + (0.05916/n) * log(Q)

1.03 = 1.23 + (0.05916/4) * log(Q)

Subtract 1.23 from both sides:

1.03 - 1.23 = (0.01479) * log(Q)

-0.20 = 0.01479 * log(Q)

So log(Q) = -0.20 / 0.01479 ≈ -13.46.

So Q = 10^(-13.46) ≈ 3.47e-14.

But if Q = [H+]^4 / (P_O2), but wait, I think I made a mistake in defining Q. Let me get back to the definition.

The reaction is O2 + 4H+ → 2H2O. So the reaction quotient Q for the reduction is [H2O]^2 / ([O2] [H+]^4 ). Since [H2O] is 1, Q = 1/(P_O2 [H+]^4 ). But in the Nernst equation, when the reaction is written as a reduction, the equation is E = E° - (0.05916/n) * log(Q), where Q is the reaction quotient for the reduction.

Wait, no, perhaps I should remember that the Nernst equation can be written as E = E° - (0.05916/n) * log(K), where K is the equilibrium constant. But in this case, it's not at equilibrium; it's a general condition.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the cell potential under non-standard conditions. Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula E = E° - (0.05916/n) * log(Q), but I'm getting confused now.

Wait, another approach: the standard reduction potential is E°, and when the conditions change, the actual E is calculated by the Nernst equation. The equation is:

E = E° - (0.05916 V / n) * log(Q)

But wait, some sources define Q as [products]/[reactants], but others might define it differently. Let me make sure.

Alternatively, the Nernst equation can be written as:

E = E° - (0.05916/n) * log(Q_rev), where Q_rev is the reaction quotient for the reverse reaction.

Wait, perhaps I got the sign wrong. Let me think again.

The correct Nernst equation is E = E° - (0.05916/n) * log(Q), where Q is the reaction quotient for the reaction as written.

But I'm getting conflicting signs. Let me check: for the reaction aA + bB → cC + dD,

E = E° - (0.05916/n) * log( [C]^c [D]^d / [A]^a [B]^b )

Wait, no, I think that's incorrect. The correct form is E = E° - (0.05916/n) * log(Q), where Q is [products]/[reactants] for the reaction as written.

So in this case, the reaction is O2 + 4H+ → 2H2O. So Q is [H2O]^2 / ([O2][H+]^4 ), but [H2O] is 1, so Q = 1/( [O2][H+]^4 ). Because O2 is a gas, [O2] is its partial pressure in atm, so a_O2 = 1.00, meaning P_O2 = 1 atm.

So Q = 1 / (1 * [H+]^4 ) = 1/[H+]^4.

So E = E° - (0.05916/4) * log(Q)

Given E = 1.03 V, E° = 1.23 V.

So,

1.03 = 1.23 - (0.05916/4) * log(Q)

Subtract 1.23 from both sides:

1.03 - 1.23 = - (0.01479) * log(Q)

-0.20 = -0.01479 * log(Q)

Divide both sides by -0.01479:

log(Q) = (-0.20)/(-0.01479) ≈ 13.46

So Q = 10^13.46 ≈ 2.88 × 10^13.

But Q is 1/[H+]^4, so:

1/[H+]^4 = 2.88e13 → [H+]^4 = 1/(2.88e13) ≈ 3.47e-14.

So [H+] = (3.47e-14)^(1/4). Let's compute that.

Take the logarithm: log(3.47e-14) = log(3.47) + (-14) ≈ 0.5408 -14 = -13.4592.

Divide by 4: -13.4592/4 ≈ -3.3648.

So [H+] = 10^(-3.3648) ≈ 10^(-3) * 10^(-0.3648).

10^(-3) is 0.001.

10^(-0.3648) is approximately 0.435 (since 10^0.3648 ≈ 2.29, so reciprocal is 1/2.29 ≈ 0.436).

So [H+] ≈ 0.001 * 0.436 = 0.000436 M.

Which is 4.36 × 10^-4 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.16e-4, option B is 8.5e-4, option C is 1.09e-4, etc. So 4.36e-4 is closest to option A, which is 4.16e-4, but perhaps I made a slight approximation.

Wait, let me check the exact calculation of 10^(-0.3648). Let me compute it more accurately.

We can use the Taylor series or a calculator-like approach. Alternatively, note that log(2) ≈ 0.3010, log(2.29) ≈ 0.36.

Wait, 10^0.36 ≈ 2.29, so 10^(-0.36) ≈ 1/2.29 ≈ 0.436.

So 10^(-3.3648) = 10^(-3) * 10^(-0.3648) ≈ 0.001 * 0.435 ≈ 0.000435, which is 4.35e-4. So approximately 4.35 × 10^-4 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.16e-4, which is close. Option B is 8.5e-4, which is higher. So perhaps the correct answer is option A: 4.16e-4.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because I think I might have made a mistake in the sign earlier.

Wait, let me summarize:

E = E° - (0.05916/4) * log(Q)

Given E = 1.03 V, E°=1.23 V.

So 1.03 = 1.23 - (0.01479) * log(Q)

So 1.03 -1.23 = -0.01479 * log(Q)

-0.20 = -0.01479 * log(Q)

Divide both sides by -0.01479: log(Q) = (-0.20)/(-0.01479) ≈ 13.46.

Thus, Q = 10^13.46 ≈ 2.88e13.

But Q = 1/[H+]^4, so [H+]^4 = 1/(2.88e13) ≈ 3.47e-14.

Taking the fourth root:

[H+] = (3.47e-14)^(1/4).

Let me compute this more accurately. Let's take the logarithm:

log(3.47e-14) = log(3.47) + (-14) ≈ 0.5408 -14 = -13.4592.

Divide by 4: -13.4592/4 ≈ -3.3648.

So [H+] = 10^(-3.3648) ≈ 4.35e-4 M.

So that's about 4.35 × 10^-4, which is closest to option A: 4.16e-4.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial steps, maybe the setup of Q is wrong. Let me check once more.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should have used the reverse reaction. Because the reaction is O2 + 4H+ + 4e^- → 2H2O, with E = 1.03 V. But perhaps the Nernst equation is being applied to the reverse reaction, which would make the equation E = E° - (0.05916/n) * log(Q), where Q is the reaction quotient for the reaction as written.

Wait, but I think the setup I did is correct. Let me try to compute [H+] again.

Wait, [H+]^4 = 3.47e-14 → [H+] = (3.47e-14)^(1/4).

Let me compute this using exponents:

3.47e-14 = 3.47 × 10^-14.

The fourth root of 3.47 is approximately 1.36, because 1.36^4 ≈ (1.36)^2 = 1.85, squared again is about 3.42, which is close to 3.47.

The fourth root of 10^-14 is 10^(-14/4) = 10^-3.5 ≈ 3.16e-4.

So combining, [H+] ≈ 1.36 × 3.16e-4 ≈ 4.3e-4 M.

Which again is around 4.3e-4, so option A is 4.16e-4, which is the closest.
</think>

The problem involves determining the activity of hydrogen ions, \( a_{\mathrm{H}^+} \), for the reaction:

\[
\mathrm{O}_2(g) + 4\mathrm{H}^+(aq) + 4\mathrm{e}^- \rightarrow 2\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}(l)
\]

The half-cell potential \( E \) is given as \( +1.03 \, \mathrm{V} \) at \( 298.15 \, \mathrm{K} \) with \( a_{\mathrm{O}_2} = 1.00 \). The standard potential \( E^\circ \) for this reaction is \( +1.23 \, \mathrm{V} \). Using the Nernst equation:

\[
E = E^\circ - \frac{0.05916}{n} \log(Q)
\]

where \( n = 4 \) (number of electrons transferred), and \( Q \) is the reaction quotient:

\[
Q = \frac{1}{a_{\mathrm{O}_2} \cdot [\mathrm{H}^+]^4}
\]

Substituting \( E = 1.03 \, \mathrm{V} \), \( E^\circ = 1.23 \, \mathrm{V} \), \( a_{\mathrm{O}_2} = 1.00 \), and \( Q = \frac{1}{[\mathrm{H}^+]^4} \), the equation becomes:

\[
1.03 = 1.23 - \frac{0.05916}{4} \log\left(\frac{1}{[\mathrm{H}^+]^4}\right)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
1.03 - 1.23 = -\frac{0.01479}{1} \log\left(\frac{1}{[\mathrm{H}^+]^4}\right)
\]

\[
-0.20 = -0.01479 \log\left(\frac{1}{[\mathrm{H}^+]^4}\right)
\]

\[
\log\left(\frac{1}{[\mathrm{H}^+]^4}\right) = \frac{-0.20}{-0.01479} \approx 13.46
\]

\[
\frac{1}{[\mathrm{H}^+]^4} = 10^{13.46} \approx 2.88 \times 10^{13}
\]

\[
[\mathrm{H}^+]^4 = \frac{1}{2.88 \times 10^{13}} \approx 3.47 \times 10^{-14}
\]

Taking the fourth root:

\[
[\mathrm{H}^+] = (3.47 \times 10^{-14})^{1/4}
\]

\[
\log(3.47 \times 10^{-14}) = \log(3.47) + (-14) \approx 0.5408 - 14 = -13.4592
\]

\[
\frac{-13.4592}{4} \approx -3.3648
\]

\[
[\mathrm{H}^+] = 10^{-3.3648} \approx 4.35 \times 10^{-4}
\]

This value is closest to option A (\( 4.16 \times 10^{-4} \)).

ANSWER: A
