Okay, so I've got this question about cells in the eye that respond to low levels of illumination. Hmm, I remember from biology class that the eye has different parts, each with specific functions. Let me think through this.

The question is asking which cells are responsible for low light conditions. I recall that there are two main types of photoreceptor cells in the eye: rods and cones. Rods are more sensitive to low light, while cones handle color and high-resolution vision. So, rods must be the ones that respond in low illumination.

Looking at the options, option H is Rods. That seems right. Other options: A is Retinal cells, which is a general term, but I think retinal cells include rods and cones. B is Fovea cells, and the fovea has a high concentration of cones. So that's not it for low light. C is Photoreceptor cells, which is a broader category, but the question is more specific about low levels, so I think it's asking for the specific type, which is rods.

D is Macula cells, and the macula is part of the retina where the fovea is located, again more about cones. E, Nocturnal detectors, that sounds made up, not a term I remember. F, Optic nerve cells, those transmit signals, not the receptors themselves. G is Cones, which are for bright light and color. I, Sclera cells, that's the white part, not related. J, Pupil detectors, that's the muscles that adjust the pupil size, not the light receptors.

So the correct answer should be H, Rods.

The cells in the eye that respond to low levels of illumination are rods. They are specialized photoreceptor cells located in the retina, particularly in the peripheral areas, and are responsible for vision in low-light conditions. 

Answer: H
