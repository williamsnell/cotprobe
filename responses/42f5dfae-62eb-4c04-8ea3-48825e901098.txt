Okay, so I've got this question about verbal stimuli and whether they can be an acquired source of drive. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my psychology, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking to discuss whether verbal stimuli can be an acquired source of drive. So, drive refers to motivations or incentives that influence behavior. Acquired suggests that it's something learned, not innately present from birth.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A says verbal cues are effective only in specific cultural contexts. That makes sense because different cultures might respond differently to words. For example, certain phrases or words might motivate people in one culture but not another. So A is a possibility, but I'm not sure if it's the best answer.

Option B claims only non-verbal stimuli can serve as sources of drive. Wait, that doesn't sound right. I remember that verbal reinforcement is a thing in operant conditioning. Like, telling someone "good job" can motivate them. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C states that verbal stimuli are a source of drive only in early childhood. I don't think that's true. Adults are definitely motivated by verbal cues too, like praise at work. So C is likely wrong.

Option D says verbal stimuli are innate. No, I think they're learned. For example, a baby doesn't understand words, but as they grow, they learn the meaning, which can then serve as a motivator. So D is incorrect.

Option E says verbal stimuli are not acquired. That's the opposite of what the question is suggesting. The question is saying they might be acquired, so E is probably wrong.

Option F claims verbal stimuli only affect animals, not humans. That can't be right. Humans are definitely affected by verbal cues. So F is incorrect.

Option G says verbal stimuli can only motivate if there's physical reinforcement. I don't think that's true. Verbal praise alone can be a strong motivator without any physical reward. So G is wrong.

Option H states verbal stimuli have no motivational properties and are purely informational. That doesn't seem right because, as I thought earlier, words can motivate. So H is incorrect.

Option I says language has no influence on behavior. Again, this is wrong because language is a big part of communication and motivation. So I is wrong.

Option J suggests certain verbal cues become acquired motivational sources through learned responses. This sounds familiar. Like, if you're told you're doing well often, you might start to feel motivated by that praise. So J seems correct.

So putting it all together, the answer should be J. It aligns with the idea that through learning, certain words or cues can become sources of drive.
