Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best answer to this multiple-choice question about designing an intervention program to improve relations between old and new residents in a housing project. The question is asking which interaction strategy would best facilitate improved relations through contact. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the goal is to reduce antagonism and hostility. The situation is that old and new residents are in conflict, and the consultant wants to arrange interactions that can help improve their relations. The key here is to find the option that promotes positive interaction and understanding between the two groups.

Looking at the options:

Option A suggests each group reinforces their own positive traits without considering the other. That might not help because it doesn't bring them together to address their mutual issues.

Option B talks about separating old and new residents during interactions. That doesn't make sense because separation would likely increase tensions rather than reduce them.

Option C is about encouraging residents to ignore each other. Ignoring isn't a solution; it's more likely to escalate problems.

Option D proposes open discussions where each group can discuss the negative criticisms of the other. While open dialogue is good, the wording here says "all-out discussion about what each group believes to be the negative crits." That might lead to more conflict if it's just airing grievances without a structured approach to resolving them.

Option E mentions making explicit the status hierarchy that's implicit in interactions. That could actually make things worse by highlighting differences and potential power struggles.

Option F allows residents to vent frustrations without moderation. Venting without guidance might lead to more anger and not productive discussions.

Option G suggests competitive activities to establish dominance. Competitions can increase animosity rather than foster cooperation.

Option H is about allowing each group to disconfirm negative traits of the other. So, this means they can show that the other group isn't as negative as they thought. This seems promising because it allows for correcting stereotypes and building mutual understanding.

Option I involves only the leaders discussing, which might not engage the entire community and could limit broader interaction.

So, considering all options, Option H seems the best because it allows both groups to challenge and disprove each other's negative traits through interaction. This approach can help reduce misunderstandings and build a more positive relationship between the two groups.

The best approach to improve relations is to allow interactions that help each group disconfirm negative traits about the other, fostering understanding and reducing antagonism.
