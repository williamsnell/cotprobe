Question:

A defendant was arrested and charged with possession of heroin. At the defendant's preliminary hearing, the prosecution presented evidence that the defendant was arrested while riding in a car. The heroin was found in a briefcase containing no identification, but several papers found inside contained references to the defendant. The defendant's attorney argued that the briefcase did not belong to the defendant, and the defendant had no idea how the heroin got inside the briefcase. The court ruled that there was insufficient probable cause to support a prosecution of the defendant on the heroin possession charge. The defendant was released from custody and charges were dropped. Several weeks later, a grand jury was convened to determine if the defendant should be re-indicted for heroin possession based on the same alleged incident reviewed at the preliminary hearing. The defendant was called to testif' as a witness at the grand jury hearing. He appeared and was sworn in as a witness. The defendant proceeded to challenge the proceeding on the basis that any grand jury indictment for heroin possession would constitute a violation of the double jeopardy clause. The defendant's double jeopardy challenge should be

Options:

A: denied, because there is no basis for a double jeopardy challenge.
B: granted, because the heroin possession charge was formally dismissed at the preliminary hearing.
C: denied, because double jeopardy rights do not attach unless there has been an acquittal or conviction.
D: granted, because the defendant has the right to avoid self-incrimination.
E: denied, because the grand jury proceeding is not considered a trial.
F: granted, because by voluntarily appearing at the grand jury hearing, the defendant has standing to challenge the indictment.
G: granted, because the defendant has already been tried for the same charge.
H: denied, because double jeopardy only applies if the initial charge resulted in a conviction or acquittal.
I: granted, because the defendant was previously held in custody for the same charge.

Okay, so I have this question about double jeopardy, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: A defendant was arrested for heroin possession. At the preliminary hearing, the prosecution presented evidence that he was in a car where heroin was found in a briefcase with papers referencing him. His attorney said the briefcase wasn't his, and he didn't know how the heroin got there. The court ruled there wasn't enough probable cause, so the charges were dropped, and he was released.

Then, weeks later, a grand jury is convened again for the same incident. The defendant is called as a witness, sworn in, and he challenges the grand jury's indictment on double jeopardy grounds. The question is whether his challenge should be granted or denied.

I remember that double jeopardy protects against being tried twice for the same offense after a conviction or acquittal. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. So, when does double jeopardy attach? I think it's when a defendant is either acquitted or convicted after a trial. But what about before that, like during a preliminary hearing or grand jury proceedings?

In this case, the defendant had a preliminary hearing where the charge was dismissed. But I'm not sure if that dismissal counts as an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes. From what I recall, a preliminary hearing is a proceeding where the judge decides if there's enough evidence to go to trial. If the judge dismisses the charges there, that's not an acquittal. An acquittal typically comes after a trial or a plea bargain that's accepted by the court.

Wait, but in some cases, if the court dismisses the case, does that count as an acquittal? Or is it more like a dismissal without prejudice, meaning the prosecution can bring the charges again later? I think in many jurisdictions, a dismissal without an acquittal doesn't bar re-prosecution because it's not a final determination of guilt or innocence. It's more like the court deciding there's not enough evidence at that point, but the prosecution can gather more and refile.

So in this case, the charge was dismissed at the preliminary hearing, but that's not an acquittal. Therefore, the double jeopardy clause wouldn't apply because jeopardy didn't attach. Jeopardy typically attaches when the jury is sworn in a jury trial or when the first witness is sworn in a bench trial. But the preliminary hearing isn't a trialâ€”it's a different proceeding. So the dismissal there doesn't trigger double jeopardy.

Now, the defendant is called to testify before the grand jury. He argues that being indicted again would violate double jeopardy. But since there was no conviction or acquittal, jeopardy hasn't attached yet. The grand jury proceeding is an investigation phase, not a trial. Even if he's indicted again, he hasn't been tried, so double jeopardy doesn't prevent that.

Looking at the options, Option C says "denied, because double jeopardy rights do not attach unless there has been an acquittal or conviction." That seems to fit because the dismissal at the preliminary hearing wasn't an acquittal. Option H says "denied, because double jeopardy only applies if the initial charge resulted in a conviction or acquittal." That also aligns with what I'm thinking.

Other options: Option B says it's granted because the charge was dismissed at the preliminary hearing. But dismissal isn't the same as acquittal, so B might be incorrect. Option E says that the grand jury proceeding isn't a trial, which is true, but the question is whether double jeopardy applies when they try to indict again. Since jeopardy hasn't attached, E is correct in saying it's denied, but E is about the nature of the proceeding, not the double jeopardy itself. The main point is about whether jeopardy has attached, not just the type of proceeding.

So the correct reasoning is that double jeopardy doesn't attach unless there's an acquittal or conviction. In this case, the dismissal wasn't an acquittal, so the defendant's challenge should be denied.

The defendant's double jeopardy challenge should be denied because double jeopardy rights only attach if there has been an acquittal or conviction. In this case, the charges were dismissed at the preliminary hearing, which is not equivalent to an acquittal. Therefore, the prosecution is not barred from re-indicting the defendant.

Answer: C
