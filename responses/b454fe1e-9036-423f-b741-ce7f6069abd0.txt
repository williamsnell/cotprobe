Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) and how it affects the total increase in GDP from new spending. Hmm, I remember that MPC is a key concept in Keynesian economics, related to the multiplier effect. 

The question states that the MPC is 0.8, and there's $500 of new spending. They're asking for the largest total increase in GDP that results from this. The options are A through J, with various dollar amounts.

Wait, I think the formula for the multiplier effect is 1 divided by (1 minus MPC). So if MPC is 0.8, then 1 - 0.8 is 0.2, and 1 divided by 0.2 is 5. So the multiplier is 5. That means every dollar of new spending leads to a $5 increase in GDP. 

But I'm a bit confusedâ€”does the $500 get multiplied by the MPC, or by the multiplier? Let me think. The multiplier is (1 / (1 - MPC)), which in this case is 5. So the total increase in GDP should be the new spending multiplied by the multiplier. So $500 times 5 equals $2500. 

Wait, but sometimes I've heard that the MPC affects the size of the multiplier. Oh right, because when MPC is high, people spend more of each additional dollar, leading to a bigger multiplier effect. So higher MPC gives a larger multiplier. 

So with MPC at 0.8, that's a pretty high MPC, meaning each dollar of income leads to 80 cents of consumption. Thus, the multiplier is indeed 5. So $500 *5 is $2500. 

Looking at the options, A is $2500, which matches what I calculated. But wait, is there a chance that the question is about the change in equilibrium GDP directly? Because sometimes, the formula is used to find the equilibrium output. But in this case, the question is about the largest total increase from $500 of new spending, so yes, the multiplier applies here.

I'm pretty confident now. The answer should be option A: $2,500.

The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is 0.8, meaning that for every additional dollar of income, 80 cents are spent. The multiplier effect formula is 1 / (1 - MPC), which equals 5. Therefore, $500 of new spending leads to a total increase in GDP of $500 * 5 = $2,500.

Answer: A
