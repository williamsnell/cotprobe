Okay, so I have this question about phenylketonuria (PKU) and the risk of having a child with abnormalities if the mother isn't treated. Hmm, I remember PKU is a genetic disorder, right? It's something to do with the body not being able to process phenylalanine properly. But wait, how does that affect the child?

I think PKU is inherited, usually as a recessive trait. So both parents need to carry the gene for the child to have it. But wait, the question is about the mother having untreated PKU. Does that mean she's a carrier or actually affected? Oh, right, the mother has the condition, so she must have two copies of the defective gene.

If the mother has PKU and isn't treated, how does that affect her pregnancy? I remember that high levels of phenylalanine in the mother can be teratogenic, meaning they can cause birth defects. Because if the mother can't process phenylalanine, it builds up, and that can cross the placenta and affect the fetus.

So the risk isn't just about the child inheriting PKU, but more about the environmental factors during pregnancy. If the mother isn't treated, her blood has high phenylalanine, which can lead to issues like microcephaly, heart defects, or other abnormalities in the baby.

I think the risk isn't 100%, but it's quite high. I've heard that if PKU is untreated in the mother, the risk of having a child with abnormalities is around 30-50%. Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's higher? Or is it lower?

Alternatively, I think the risk is about 10%. No, wait, that seems too low. I remember reading that the risk is significantly increased but not 100%. So looking at the options, the choices are A:25%, B:15%, C:75%, D:60%, E:50%, F:1%, G:10%, H:30%, I:Almost 100%, J:90%.

I think the risk is around 30-50% when untreated. But I'm not exactly sure. Wait, I recall that maternal PKU, if untreated, has a high risk of causing congenital anomalies. I think the risk is about 30% or so. So looking at the options, H is 30% and E is 50%.

Wait, another angle: PKU is autosomal recessive. So the mother has two recessive alleles. The father, unless he's also affected, probably has one normal and one recessive. But the question is about the mother's risk. So the chance of the child getting the recessive gene depends on the father's genotype. But wait, the question is about the risk of abnormality in the child, not the risk of the child having PKU.

Oh right, the abnormality is due to the high phenylalanine levels during pregnancy, not just the inheritance of the gene. So even if the child doesn't have PKU, the mother's condition can cause issues. So the risk is about whether the mother's PKU is treated or not.

I think when the mother has PKU and doesn't receive treatment (like a low-protein diet and possibly medications to lower phenylalanine levels), the risk of having a child with birth defects is about 30-50%. But I'm not certain. Some sources say that the risk is around 30%, others might say higher. I think the correct answer is H:30%.

The risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated phenylketonuria (PKU) is primarily due to the accumulation of phenylalanine, which can cross the placenta and affect the fetus. This can lead to congenital anomalies such as microcephaly or heart defects. The risk is significantly increased but not 100%. Based on available information, the risk is estimated to be around 30%.
