Question:

A defendant was convicted of assault of a federal officer and imprisoned in a federal penitentiary. While in prison, federal authorities began investigating the murder of the defendant's 11-year- old stepdaughter who was murdered two years earlier. Believing that the defendant was responsible for this killing, federal agents decided to plant an informant at the prison to befriend the defendant and possibly obtain evidence about the crime. In accord with this plan, the federal agents hired a paid informant and placed him in the prison as a fellow inmate, masquerading as an organized crime figure. The informant soon befriended the defendant and learned that he was being threatened by other inmates because of a rumor that he had killed a child. The informant then raised the subject in several conversations, but the defendant repeatedly denied any such involvement. After the defendant started receiving tough treatment from other inmates because of the rumor, the informant offered to protect the defendant but told him, "You have to tell me the truth about what really happened you know, if you want me to help you. " Believing that the informant would protect him from the other inmates, the defendant then admitted to the informant that he had driven his stepdaughter to the desert where he killed her. Based upon this confession, the defendant was then indicted for the first-degree murder of his stepdaughter. Prior to trial, the defendant moves to suppress the statement given to the informant. Should the defendant's motion be granted?

Options:

A: Yes, because the informant was acting as an agent of the government in a deceptive manner.
B: No, because under the totality of circumstances, the informant's conduct was not inherently coercive.
C: Yes, because the informant was a false friend, and the defendant was tricked into making the confession.
D: No, because the confession was made to a fellow inmate, not to a law enforcement official.
E: Yes, because the defendant was not read his Miranda rights before confessing to the informant.
F: Yes, because the confession was coerced by the threat of physical violence, absent protection from the informant that motivated the defendant to confess.
G: No, because the defendant was not under direct questioning by law enforcement at the time of the confession.
H: No, because the confession was voluntary.
I: No, because the defendant was already convicted of a crime and thus lost his right to avoid self-incrimination.
J: No, because the defendant's safety in prison was not the responsibility of the informant.

Alright, let's try to work through this legal question. So, the defendant was convicted of assault and is in a federal prison. Then, two years prior, his 11-year-old stepdaughter was murdered, and the feds are investigating. They plant an informant in the prison who pretends to be an organized crime figure. The informant befriends the defendant and starts probing about the murder. The defendant denies it at first, but after facing tough treatment from other inmates because of the rumor, the informant offers to protect him in exchange for the truth. The defendant then confesses to the informant, leading to an indictment for first-degree murder. Now, the defendant is moving to suppress this confession.

I need to figure out whether the motion should be granted. So, the key issue here is whether the confession was obtained in violation of the defendant's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, particularly under the Miranda rules or the broader concept of coercion.

First, Miranda rights come into play when a suspect is in custody and being interrogated by law enforcement. But here, the defendant is in prison, and the informant is a paid government agent acting as a fellow inmate. The question is whether the defendant was under interrogation by a government agent, or if it's considered a private individual.

In Miranda, the court established that if a person is in custody and being questioned by law enforcement, they must be read their Miranda rights. But if the questioning is done by a non-law enforcement person, like a private citizen or an informant, Miranda doesn't apply. So, the defendant wasn't read Miranda rights here because the informant wasn't a law enforcement officer.

But wait, there's also the issue of whether the confession was obtained through coercion. Under the Fifth Amendment, a confession is only admissible if it's voluntary. If it's coerced, it's inadmissible. Coercion can be physical or psychological. Here, the defendant was being threatened by other inmates because of the rumor, and the informant offered protection in exchange for the truth. So, the defendant may have felt compelled to confess to protect himself from further harm.

I recall that in cases where an informant is used, the courts have to determine whether the government's actions created an environment where the defendant felt compelled to speak. If the government's actions were so coercive that they overcame the defendant's will, then the confession might be suppressed.

In this scenario, the informant was acting as a paid government agent, so his actions are attributable to the government. The defendant was facing threats from other inmates, and the informant offered protection, which the defendant might have felt he needed. This could be seen as a form of duress or coercion because the defendant felt he had to confess to get protection.

However, I also remember that mere friendship or trickery by an informant isn't enough to make a confession inadmissible unless there's actual coercion. The Supreme Court case of Kuhlmann v. Wilson (1986) held that the use of an informant to obtain a confession doesn't violate the Due Process Clause unless the government's actions made the confession involuntary. The court said that the mere fact that an informant is used doesn't make the confession inadmissible; it's the nature of the coercion that matters.

So, in this case, the defendant was under pressure from other inmates, and the informant offered help. But was the pressure from the inmates considered coercion by the government? The government didn't directly threaten him; it was other inmates. The informant's offer was to protect him, but that's not the same as the government coercing him.

Wait, but the informant is acting as a government agent. So, if the informant created the situation where the defendant felt he needed to confess to get protection, that could be seen as coercion by the government. Alternatively, the pressure from other inmates was due to a rumor, which the informant may have started or encouraged.

In the case of陕西省高级人民法院的判决，我记得在一些案例中，如果政府的行动导致了被告处于被迫状态，那么 confession 可能被排除。比如，如果政府故意制造压力，让被告感到必须 confess 才能得到保护，这可能被视为 coercion.

But in this case, the government agents planted the informant to befriend the defendant and possibly obtain evidence. The informant raised the subject in conversations, but the defendant denied it. Then, the informant offered protection in exchange for the truth. The defendant, fearing more harassment, confessed.

So, the key is whether the informant's actions constituted government coercion. If the informant's offer was a form of inducement that the defendant felt he couldn't refuse, then the confession might be considered coerced.

But I think the law generally allows the use of informants, and their mere friendship isn't enough to invalidate a confession unless there's some form of duress or physical threat. Here, the defendant was facing threats from other inmates, but those weren't directly from the government. The informant's offer was a carrot, not a stick from the government.

Moreover, the defendant wasn't in custody in the traditional sense when making the statement; he was talking to a fellow inmate. Miranda applies to custodial interrogation by law enforcement, which isn't the case here.

So, considering all this, the confession might be found voluntary because there was no direct coercion by the government, just through an informant. Therefore, the motion to suppress should not be granted.

The defendant's motion to suppress should not be granted because the confession was made to an informant, not a law enforcement officer, and there was no direct coercion by the government. The defendant was in custody, but Miranda rights only apply to questioning by law enforcement, not a private individual. While the defendant faced threats from other inmates, these were not directly from the government, and the informant's offer of protection was not coercive in a legal sense. Thus, the confession was voluntary.
