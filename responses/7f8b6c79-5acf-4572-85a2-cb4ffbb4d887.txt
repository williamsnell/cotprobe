Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the primary function of political action committees, or PACs. I remember from school that PACs have something to do with elections and money, but I'm not exactly sure. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I'll go through each option one by one to understand what each one is suggesting.

Option A says PACs determine the platforms of political parties. I don't think that's right. Political parties usually have their own platforms, and PACs are more about supporting candidates rather than setting the party's policies.

Option B suggests that PACs conduct independent investigations into political corruption. That sounds more like what watchdog groups or maybe the media would do, not PACs.

Option C is about providing legal advice to candidates. While PACs might offer some support, I don't think legal advice is their main role. PACs are more about funding, I believe.

Option D promotes defeating incumbents. Some PACs might target incumbents, but is that their primary function? I'm not sure. It could be a secondary goal but not the main one.

Option E says PACs provide campaign staff and resources. This seems plausible. PACs do support candidates, but I'm not certain if this is their primary function or just part of what they do.

Option F involves organizing protests and civil disobedience. That doesn't sound right. PACs are more about electoral support, not direct activism like protests.

Option G is about coordinating get-out-the-vote campaigns. That's definitely something PACs do, but is it their main function? It might be a part of their activities, but maybe not the primary.

Option H states that PACs directly campaign for specific candidates. That makes sense because PACs can spend money on behalf of candidates, but do they directly campaign, or do they just support through funding?

Option I says PACs lobby for legislation in Congress. I know that lobbying is done by various groups, including PACs, but isn't that more about influencing laws rather than their primary function in elections?

Option J contributes money to candidates. This rings a bell. I remember that PACs are allowed to contribute money to political campaigns, and that's a key part of their role.

So, putting this together, the primary function of PACs is related to funding candidates. Option J says they contribute money to candidates, which aligns with what I recall. While they might do other things like providing resources or helping with campaigns, the main purpose is to raise and spend money to support candidates, especially in elections.

I think the answer is J. But wait, let me make sure. PACs can donate up to a certain amount to each candidate, right? They can't contribute directly to their campaigns in an unlimited way, but they do contribute money. So yes, contributing money is their primary function.
