Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about a spring-block oscillator. The question is asking about the maximum speed of the block. Hmm, I remember that in such systems, the block oscillates back and forth, and its speed changes throughout the motion. 

Wait, right, the maximum speed occurs when the block passes through the equilibrium point, right? Because that's where the kinetic energy is the highest. So I think the maximum speed depends on the amplitude of the oscillation. But how exactly?

I recall that the energy in a spring is related to the displacement. The potential energy stored in the spring when it's stretched to the maximum amplitude (let's call it A) is (1/2)kA², where k is the spring constant. Since energy is conserved, this potential energy converts into kinetic energy when the block is at the equilibrium position. 

Kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², where m is the mass and v is the velocity. At maximum speed, all the potential energy has turned into kinetic energy. So setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max². 

Oh, right, the 1/2 cancels out on both sides. So kA² = mv_max². Solving for v_max, I get v_max = sqrt(k/m) * A. Wait, because when you take the square root of both sides, it's sqrt(k/m) times sqrt(A²), which is A. So v_max is proportional to A, right?

So the maximum speed is directly proportional to the amplitude. Looking at the options, option C says "proportional to amplitude," which matches what I figured out. 

Wait, let me double-check the other options. Option A says proportional to the square, but that's not right because v_max is sqrt(k/m)*A, so it's linear in A, not squared. Option D is inversely proportional, which also doesn't fit. Options E, G, H, etc., talk about square roots or cubes, which don't match either. 

So yeah, the correct answer should be C.

The maximum speed of the block in a spring-block oscillator occurs at the equilibrium position, where all potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. Using energy conservation, the potential energy (1/2)kA² equals the kinetic energy (1/2)mv_max². Solving for v_max yields v_max = sqrt(k/m) * A, showing it is proportional to the amplitude. 

Answer: C
