Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about group theory, which I'm trying to figure out. Let's take it step by step.

The question has two statements, and I need to determine if each is true or false. The options are combinations of whether each statement is true, false, conditionally true, or conditionally false.

Let me start by understanding each statement.

**Statement 1:** If H and K are subgroups of G and one of H or K is a normal subgroup of G, then HK is a subgroup of G.

Hmm, I remember that HK is the set of all products h*k where h is in H and k is in K. Now, to check if HK is a subgroup, it needs to satisfy the subgroup criteria: closure, identity, inverses. But more importantly, I think there's a theorem about when HK is a subgroup.

I recall that if either H or K is normal in G, then HK is indeed a subgroup of G. Because if H is normal, then hK = K h for all h in H, which makes HK a subgroup. Similarly, if K is normal, the same logic applies. So I think Statement 1 is True.

Wait, but the option says "conditionally True". Does that mean it's only true under certain conditions? No, because the condition here is that one of them is normal, which is given in the statement. So Statement 1 is True, not conditionally. So maybe Statement 1 is True regardless.

Wait, but I should double-check. Suppose H is normal in G. Then for any h1 in H and k1, k2 in K, h1*k1*k2 is in HK. But to check closure, if I take hk and h'k', I need to see if their product is in HK. Wait, but if H is normal, then hk = k h^{-1} or something? No, wait, if H is normal, then h'k' would be k' h' because H is normal, so h'k' = k' h'. So to multiply hk and h'k', which is h k h' k', since H is normal, h' is in H, so h h' is in H, and then I can rearrange as h (h' k') k, which would be h (k' h') k because H is normal. Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. The key point is that if either H or K is normal, HK is a subgroup. So Statement 1 is True.

**Statement 2:** All groups of order p², where p is prime, are Abelian.

I remember that groups of order p² are indeed Abelian. Because the only groups of order p² are the cyclic group Z_{p²} and the direct product Z_p × Z_p. Both are Abelian. Let me think again: the order is p squared, so the center of the group must be non-trivial. For a group of order p², the center Z(G) has order p or p². If Z(G) is the entire group, then it's Abelian. If Z(G) has order p, then the quotient group G/Z(G) would have order p, which is cyclic. But for a group G where G/Z(G) is cyclic, G is Abelian, which would imply Z(G)=G. So yes, all groups of order p² are Abelian. So Statement 2 is True.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. What about the Heisenberg group over a field of order p? No, wait, that's for order p³, right? For p², I think it's definitely Abelian. So Statement 2 is True.

Putting it together: Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is True. Looking at the options, option D is "True, True". But wait, let me check the options again.

Looking back at the options:

A: Statement 1 is conditionally True, Statement 2 is False
B: Statement 1 is conditionally False, Statement 2 is True
C: Statement 1 is conditionally True, Statement 2 is True
D: True, True
E: False, True
F: Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is conditionally True
G: Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is conditionally False
H: Statement 1 is False, Statement 2 is conditionally True
I: True, False
J: False, False

Wait, but the options don't all use "conditionally". Option D says both are True. So my initial thought is that both are True, so the answer would be D. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, another thought: for Statement 1, is HK always a subgroup if one of H or K is normal? Suppose H is normal in G. Then HK is a subgroup because H normal implies HK is a subgroup. Similarly, if K is normal, same. So yes, Statement 1 is True.

And Statement 2 is definitely True because groups of order p² are Abelian.

So the correct answer would be option D: True, True.

The first statement is true because if either H or K is a normal subgroup, then HK forms a subgroup of G. The second statement is true as all groups of order p² are Abelian. 

Answer: D
