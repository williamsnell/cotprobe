Question:

Which of these explains why t should be used instead of z for inference procedures for means.

Options:

A: The use of t instead of z is simply a convention in statistics, with no mathematical reason.
B: The Central Limit Theorem applies to means but not proportions.
C: We use z for proportions because proportions are approximately normal. Means are not.
D: We use z for proportions because the sampling distribution of sample proportions is approximately normal, but that is not the case for the sampling distribution of sample means.
E: We use t for means because the sampling distribution of sample means is approximately normal, but that is not the case for proportions.
F: When using the sample standard deviation to estimate the population standard deviation, more variability is introduced into the sampling distribution of the statistic.
G: The Central Limit Theorem applies to proportions but not means.
H: We use t for means because it provides a more accurate estimate of the population mean.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about why we use the t-statistic instead of the z-statistic for inference procedures involving means. Hmm, I remember that z-scores are used when we know the population standard deviation, and t-scores are used when we don't, especially with small sample sizes. But let me think through each option carefully.

The question is asking why t is used instead of z for means. So, I need to focus on what differentiates the use cases for t and z. I recall that the z-test assumes we know the population standard deviation (σ), but when we estimate it using the sample standard deviation (s), especially with small samples, the t-distribution is more appropriate because it has heavier tails, accounting for the extra uncertainty.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Says it's just a convention. That doesn't sound right because there's a mathematical reason related to the unknown population standard deviation.

Option B: Central Limit Theorem (CLT) applies to means but not proportions. Wait, CLT does apply to means, making the sampling distribution normal regardless of the population distribution, given a large enough sample. But this is talking about CLT's application, not why we use t instead of z. So B doesn't directly answer the question about t vs z.

Option C: We use z for proportions because they're normal, but means aren't. That's not correct because means are approximately normal due to CLT, especially with large samples. Proportions can also be approximated normally with large samples. So C is probably wrong.

Option D: Uses z for proportions because their sampling distribution is normal, but not for means. Wait, but for means, the sampling distribution is also normal (CLT), so why use t? Maybe this is mixing up proportions and means. Or perhaps it's getting at the point that proportions use z because their sampling distribution is normal, but for means, we might use t regardless? Not sure yet.

Option E: Uses t for means because their sampling distribution is normal, but not for proportions. Hmm, not quite. Both means and proportions can have normal sampling distributions (under CLT), but the issue is whether we know the population standard deviation. For proportions, we might use z, but I'm getting confused here.

Option F: When using sample standard deviation (s) instead of population (σ), more variability is introduced. This makes sense because when σ is unknown and we use s, the t-distribution accounts for that extra variability, especially with small samples. So F seems like a good candidate.

Option G: CLT applies to proportions but not means. No, CLT applies to means, so G is wrong.

Option H: We use t for means because it provides a more accurate estimate. I think accuracy isn't the main reason; it's more about the distribution's properties when σ is unknown.

So, breaking it down, the key reason is that when σ is unknown and we estimate it with s, the t-distribution is more appropriate, especially with small samples. This is because the t-distribution has a higher variability in the tails to account for the uncertainty of not knowing σ. So, option F says that using s introduces more variability, which is why t is used. That seems correct.

Wait, let me check again. The z-statistic is used when σ is known, and t is used when σ is estimated by s. The t-distribution has more variability, which is why F is the right choice. Yeah, that makes sense.

The t-statistic is used instead of the z-statistic for inference procedures involving means when the population standard deviation (σ) is unknown and must be estimated using the sample standard deviation (s). This is particularly important with small sample sizes, as the t-distribution accounts for the added uncertainty introduced by estimating σ. The t-distribution has heavier tails compared to the z-distribution, providing a more conservative estimate of the sampling distribution.

Answer: F
