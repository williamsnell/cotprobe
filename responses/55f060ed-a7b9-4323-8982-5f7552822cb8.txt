The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A 15-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents because of a 2-hour history of confusion and agitation. He also has had fever, headache, stiff neck, and vomiting since he returned from summer camp 2 days ago. His parents say he does not use illicit drugs. On arrival, he is combative and there is evidence of hallucinations. His temperature is 40°C (104°F), pulse is 80/min, respirations are 17/min, and blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg. A lumbar puncture is performed. Results of cerebrospinal fluid analysis show cysts and trophozoites. The most likely portal of pathogen entry into this patient's central nervous system is which of the following?

Options:

A: Mastoid sinus
B: Frontal sinus
C: Nasal cavity
D: Olfactory nerve
E: Vertebral canal
F: Oral cavity
G: Optic nerve
H: Eustachian tube
I: Auditory canal
J: Facial nerve

Answer:

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this medical question. Let me read through it again carefully.

The patient is a 15-year-old boy brought to the ER with confusion, agitation, fever, headache, stiff neck, and vomiting for two days after returning from summer camp. His parents say he doesn't use illicit drugs. On arrival, he's combative with hallucinations. His vitals are: temp 40°C, pulse 80, resps 17, BP 100/70. A lumbar puncture was done, and the CSF analysis shows cysts and trophozoites.

The question is asking about the most likely portal of entry into the CNS for the pathogen.

Hmm, okay. So first, let's think about the symptoms. Fever, headache, stiff neck, vomiting—those are classic signs of meningitis. The confusion and agitation, plus hallucinations, suggest possible encephalitis or maybe a space-occupying lesion, but the CSF analysis is key here.

CSF shows cysts and trophozoites. That makes me think of something like protozoal infection. Common ones include amoebic infections like Naegleria fowleri or maybe Cryptosporidium, but wait, the presence of both cysts and trophozoites—Naegleria is a free-living amoeba that causes primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), which is usually fatal. It enters through the nose, I remember that. Oh, right, because it can get into the brain via the olfactory nerve after entering through the nasal cavity.

So the pathogen likely entered through the nasal cavity. Let's think about the options. The options are A to J, including various sinuses, nerves, etc.

Looking at the options:

A: Mastoid sinus – part of the ear, usually related to middle ear infections leading to mastoiditis, not typically the entry for amoebic infections.

B: Frontal sinus – another sinus, but again, more related to sinusitis or infections spreading from there, not the primary entry point for something like Naegleria.

C: Nasal cavity – this seems likely because Naegleria fowleri is typically contracted by entering through the nose, especially in warm freshwater. So if he was at summer camp, maybe he was swimming or diving in a lake or river.

D: Olfactory nerve – this is where the amoeba would travel after entering the nose, but the portal is the nose itself, not the nerve.

E: Vertebral canal – that's more for infections like spinal meningitis that go up the脊髓, but the entry here is more likely through the nose, so E is less likely.

F: Oral cavity – maybe if it's something like Entamoeba histolytica causing intestinal issues, but in this case, the infection is in the CNS, so probably not the oral route.

G: Optic nerve – not typically a portal for amoebic entry unless there's an eye infection, which doesn't seem to be the case here.

H: Eustachian tube – connects the middle ear to the throat; more about pressure equalization. Not the entry point for amoebas.

I: Auditory canal – outer ear, not the usual entry for this kind of infection.

J: Facial nerve – maybe if there's a parotid infection or something, but not relevant here.

So the most likely entry is through the nasal cavity, option C. That makes sense because Naegleria fowleri enters through the nose, especially in warm water, which is a common scenario in summer camps.

The patient presents with symptoms indicative of meningitis and encephalitis, including fever, headache, stiff neck, vomiting, confusion, and hallucinations. The CSF analysis showing cysts and trophozoites suggests a protozoal infection. Naegleria fowleri, a free-living amoeba causing primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), is a likely culprit. This pathogen typically enters the CNS through the nasal cavity, especially in warm freshwater exposure, which aligns with the patient's recent summer camp activities. Among the options provided, the nasal cavity (C) is the most plausible portal of entry.

Answer: C
