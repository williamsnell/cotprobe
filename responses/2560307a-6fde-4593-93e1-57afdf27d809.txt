Alright, I've got this question about the percentage of survey respondents from China who reported paying a bribe in the last year for public services as of 2017. The options are A through J, with various percentages.

First, I need to recall any information I might have about bribery in China around that time. I remember that China has been making efforts to combat corruption, especially under the leadership of President Xi Jinping. There have been high-profile anti-corruption campaigns, which might have reduced the incidence of bribery.

I think the question is from a survey, probably something like the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index or maybe a local survey. I'm not exactly sure about the exact figure, but I remember hearing that the percentage has gone down in recent years.

Looking at the options: A is 66%, B is 30%, C is 70%, D is 110% which is impossible, E is 86%, F is 46%, G is 90%, H is 26%, I is 50%, J is 10%. 

I think the number is lower than 50%, so I can eliminate options A, C, E, G, I, and maybe F if I'm not sure. Wait, 46% is still quite high. I'm trying to remember if it's around 20-30% or lower. Oh, I think I read that in recent years, the percentage has been dropping, maybe into the low twenties or even lower.

Wait, I think the correct figure is around 26%. That would be option H. I remember a report stating that around a quarter of respondents admitted to paying bribes, which is 25-26%. So option H, 26%, seems right.

The correct answer is H: 26%. 

Answer: H
