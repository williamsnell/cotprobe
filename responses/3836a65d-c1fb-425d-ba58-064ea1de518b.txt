Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about how productive resources are allocated in the Soviet economy and how that differs from a market economy. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that the Soviet economy was a command economy, which is a type of planned economy. In command economies, the government, specifically the central authority, makes all the decisions about what to produce, how to produce it, and how to distribute goods and services. So, in the Soviet case, I think the central planning committee would be responsible for allocating resources. 

In contrast, a market economy relies on supply and demand to determine how resources are allocated. This means that producers and consumers interact in the market, and prices are determined by these interactions. The market economy doesn't have a central authority making allocation decisions; instead, it's based on the forces of supply and demand.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A says that in a market economy, resources are allocated randomly. That doesn't sound right because market economies are based on supply and demand, not randomness.

Option B mentions the Soviet government investing in sectors with high expected returns. Wait, that's more like how a capitalist economy with some government intervention might work, but in the Soviet system, the government planned everything centrally, so they wouldn't necessarily focus on high returns in the same way.

Option C states that Gosbank allocates resources in the Soviet economy, and market allocation is based on expected returns. Gosbank was the central bank, but I think resource allocation in the Soviet Union was done by a central planning committee, not Gosbank. So this might not be correct.

Option D says Soviet resources are allocated by local governments and market allocation by international bodies. That doesn't seem accurate because the Soviet system had a central authority, not local governments, making the decisions. International bodies aren't typically involved in resource allocation within a country's economy.

Option E suggests resources are distributed equally among all industries in the Soviet economy. I'm not sure about that; while the Soviet Union aimed for certain equality in some aspects, resource allocation was more about meeting central plans rather than equal distribution per se.

Option F claims a single body dictates resource allocation in a market economy. No, in a market economy, it's the oppositeâ€”no single body dictates; it's the market forces.

Option G says Soviet resources are allocated by consumer votes, and producers decide in a market economy. That's the opposite of what I know. In the Soviet Union, consumers didn't vote on resources; the government planned it. Market economies let producers and consumers decide through supply and demand.

Option H states that a central planning committee allocates resources in the Soviet economy, while supply and demand dictate allocation in a market economy. This aligns with what I was thinking earlier. The central planning committee would handle resource allocation in the Soviet model, while supply and demand drive the market economy.

Option I mentions a lottery system in the Soviet Union and competitive bidding in the market. I don't recall the Soviet economy using a lottery system for resource allocation. Competitive bidding is part of some market processes, but the Soviet system was centrally planned, not random or lottery-based.

Option J says resources are allocated by the public in the Soviet economy. No, the public didn't allocate resources; the central government did.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be option H because it accurately describes both the Soviet and market economies' methods of resource allocation.

The Soviet economy was centrally planned, with resources allocated by a central planning committee, while market economies rely on supply and demand. 

Answer: H
