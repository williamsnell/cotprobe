Okay, so I have this problem about maximizing the entropy of a non-negative integer-valued random variable X. The variable can take values from 0 to infinity, and the constraint is that the expected value E(X) is 1. I need to find the maximum entropy using base 2 logarithm, and choose the correct answer from the given options A to J.

Hmm, entropy for a discrete random variable is given by H(X) = -Σ p(x) log p(x), right? So I need to maximize this sum. The variables are non-negative integers, so x can be 0,1,2,... and so on.

The constraint is that E(X) = 1. Since E(X) is the expected value, that's the sum over x*p(x) equals 1. So I have to maximize H(X) subject to E(X)=1 and of course, the probabilities p(x) sum to 1.

This seems like an optimization problem with constraints. Maybe I can use Lagrange multipliers here. I've heard of that method before in optimization.

Wait, so I need to set up the Lagrangian. Let's see. The function to maximize is H(X) = -Σ p(x) log p(x). The constraints are Σ p(x) =1 and Σ x p(x) =1.

So the Lagrangian L would be H(X) minus λ (Σ p(x) -1) minus μ (Σ x p(x) -1), right? Or maybe plus the multipliers, depending on how I set it up. Actually, the Lagrangian is usually written as the function minus the multipliers times the constraints, but I might get the signs right.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the signs. Let me think again. The standard form is L = objective function + λ*(constraint). Or wait, no, for maximization, it's L = objective function + λ*(constraint). But when dealing with constraints, like equality constraints, you add the terms involving the multipliers.

Wait, perhaps better to think of it as L = H(X) + λ(Σ p(x) -1) + μ(Σ x p(x) -1). Because we are maximizing H(X), but adding the constraints multiplied by their respective multipliers.

Wait, but actually, I think more accurately, since H(X) is to be maximized, and the constraints are equality constraints, the Lagrangian would be L = H(X) - λ(Σ p(x) -1) - μ(Σ x p(x) -1). Because we subtract the constraints multiplied by their multipliers.

Wait, perhaps I should set it up as L = H(X) + λ(Σ p(x) -1) + μ(Σ x p(x) -1), but I'm not entirely sure about the signs. Alternatively, maybe I should take the negative of the constraints. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think of it as maximizing H(X) subject to E(X)=1 and Σ p(x) =1. So the Lagrangian would be:

L = -Σ p(x) log p(x) - λ(Σ p(x) -1) - μ(Σ x p(x) -1)

Now, to find the maximum, we take the functional derivative of L with respect to p(x) for each x and set it to zero.

So for each x, the derivative of L w.r. to p(x) is:

dL/dp(x) = - [ - log p(x) -1 ] - λ - μ x = 0

Wait, let me compute that more carefully.

The derivative of -p(x) log p(x) with respect to p(x) is - [ (log p(x)) + 1 ].

So the derivative is - (log p(x) +1) - λ - μ x = 0.

Simplify: -log p(x) -1 - λ - μ x = 0 → log p(x) = -1 - λ - μ x.

Exponentiating both sides, p(x) = exp( -1 - λ - μ x ), which can be rewritten as p(x) = C * exp( -μ x ), where C is a constant to ensure that the probabilities sum to 1.

Wait, so p(x) is proportional to exp(-μ x). That suggests a geometric distribution, since the probability decreases exponentially with x. That makes sense, because the geometric distribution has pmf p(x) = (1-p) p^{x} for x=0,1,2,... which is similar to exp(-μ x) if μ is related to log(1/p).

Wait, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. Let me proceed.

So p(x) = C exp(-μ x). Now, since p(x) must sum to 1, we have:

Σ_{x=0}^∞ p(x) = C Σ_{x=0}^∞ exp(-μ x) = C / (1 - exp(-μ)) ) = 1.

So C = (1 - exp(-μ)). Thus, p(x) = (1 - exp(-μ)) exp(-μ x) = exp(-μ x) (1 - exp(-μ)).

But wait, for this sum to converge, exp(-μ) must be less than 1, which it is if μ >0. So that's good.

Now, the expected value E[X] is Σ x p(x) = Σ x (1 - exp(-μ)) exp(-μ x) = (1 - exp(-μ)) * Σ x exp(-μ x).

The sum Σ x exp(-μ x) from x=0 to ∞ is known. I think it's equal to exp(-μ)/( (1 - exp(-μ))^2 ). Let me confirm that.

Yes, the sum Σ_{x=0}^\infty x r^x = r/(1 - r)^2, where r = exp(-μ) here. So substituting, E[X] = (1 - r) * (r/(1 - r)^2) ) = r/(1 - r).

Therefore, E[X] = exp(-μ)/(1 - exp(-μ)) = 1.

Wait, because the constraint is E[X] =1, so:

exp(-μ)/(1 - exp(-μ)) =1 → exp(-μ) = 1 - exp(-μ) → 2 exp(-μ) =1 → exp(-μ) = 1/2 → -μ = ln(1/2) → μ = ln(2).

So μ is ln(2). Therefore, exp(-μ) = 1/2.

Now, let's compute p(x). p(x) = (1 - 1/2) * (1/2)^x = (1/2) * (1/2)^x = (1/2)^{x+1}.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check that: (1 - exp(-μ)) is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. So p(x) = (1/2) * (1/2)^x = (1/2)^{x+1}.

Wait, but this is a geometric distribution with parameter p=1/2, starting at x=0. So p(0)=1/2, p(1)=1/4, p(2)=1/8, etc. That makes sense.

Now, the entropy H(X) is -Σ p(x) log p(x). Let's compute that.

Each term is - (1/2)^{x+1} * log2( (1/2)^{x+1} ) = - (1/2)^{x+1} * ( -(x+1) ) = (x+1) * (1/2)^{x+1}.

So H(X) = Σ_{x=0}^\infty (x+1) (1/2)^{x+1}.

We can factor out 1/2:

H(X) = (1/2) Σ_{x=0}^\infty (x+1) (1/2)^x.

Let me make a substitution: let y = x+1, so when x=0, y=1, and the sum becomes Σ_{y=1}^\infty y (1/2)^{y-1}.

Wait, wait, actually, (x+1) (1/2)^x = y (1/2)^{y-1} where y = x+1. So the sum becomes Σ y (1/2)^{y-1} from y=1 to ∞.

But that's equal to 2 Σ y (1/2)^y from y=1 to ∞. Because (1/2)^{y-1} = 2 * (1/2)^y.

So, H(X) = (1/2) * 2 Σ y (1/2)^y = Σ y (1/2)^y.

We know that Σ_{y=1}^\infty y r^y = r/(1 - r)^2, where r =1/2.

So substituting r=1/2, we get (1/2)/(1 -1/2)^2 = (1/2)/(1/2)^2 = (1/2)/(1/4) )= 2.

So H(X) = 2.

Wait, but that's in bits, since we're using base 2 logarithm. So the entropy is 2.

Looking back at the options, option B is 2.0. So the answer should be B.

But wait, let me double-check. Did I make any mistakes in the calculations?

I started with the geometric distribution, found that μ= ln(2), and then found the pmf correctly. Then computed the entropy by expanding the sum and correctly substituted the formula for Σ y r^y. The sum evaluated to 2, so the entropy is 2.

Yes, that seems correct. So the maximum entropy under the given constraints is 2.

The problem involves maximizing the entropy \( H(X) \) of a non-negative integer-valued random variable \( X \) with values from 0 to infinity, subject to the constraint \( E(X) = 1 \). Using the method of Lagrange multipliers, it is shown that the distribution that maximizes the entropy is a geometric distribution with parameter \( p = 1/2 \). The entropy of this distribution is calculated to be 2.0, which corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
