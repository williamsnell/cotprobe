Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this property law question. Let's break it down step by step.

First, Ann owns a tract of land. On August 1, 2005, she sells an undivided one-half interest to Hunter and Willa. The deed says they're tenants by the entirety. I remember that tenants by the entirety is a type of joint ownership where each owns the whole, but neither can transfer their interest without the other's consent. It's often used by married couples. So, Hunter and Willa together own 50% of the land as tenants by the entirety.

Then, on August 1, 2006, Ann sells her remaining interest (another 50%) to Hunter and Brandon. The deed here says they're joint tenants, not tenants in common. Joint tenancy means that when one dies, the survivor gets the entire share; there's no right of survivorship for others. So in this case, Hunter and Brandon each own 50% as joint tenants. Wait, no, they're taking the remaining 50% as joint tenants, so each of them has an undivided 25% interest in the whole tract? Or do they each own 50%? Wait, no, the total interest is 100%. Ann sold 50% to Hunter and Willa as tenants by the entirety, and then the remaining 50% to Hunter and Brandon as joint tenants.

So the structure is:

- Hunter and Willa (tenants by the entirety) own 50% each, but since it's a tenancy by the entirety, each owns the whole 50%. Wait, no—no, when two people own as tenants by the entirety, each has an undivided interest, but neither can transfer without the other. So together they own 50%, each holding an undivided half of that 50%. But more accurately, each owns the entire 50% as a joint interest. Hmm, maybe it's better to think that together, they hold 50% as tenants by the entirety, meaning that each has an undivided 50% interest, but with the right of survivorship between them.

Then, the other 50% is owned by Hunter and Brandon as joint tenants. So each of them owns 25% each because together they hold 50% as joint tenants. So each has an undivided 25% interest in the entire tract.

Wait, no, because when two people hold 50% as joint tenants, each owns a 25% interest in the whole. Because 50% divided by two is 25% each.

So, let's outline the ownership:

- Ann initially owned 100%.

- She sells 50% to Hunter and Willa as tenants by the entirety. So they each have a 50% undivided interest in the 50% they own together. So each has 25% of the total tract? Or do they each own the entire 50%? No, because as tenants by the entirety, they each own the entire 50% as a joint interest, but that's a bit abstract. For the purpose of this problem, each of their interests is 50% of the tract, but with the right of survivorship between them.

Then, the remaining 50% is sold to Hunter and Brandon as joint tenants. So each of them owns 25% of the entire tract because together they own 50%, and as joint tenants, each has an undivided 25% interest.

So, the total ownership is:

Hunter: owns 50% (from the first sale) as tenant by the entirety with Willa, and also 25% from the second sale as joint tenant with Brandon. So Hunter's total interest is 75% of the tract.

Willa: owns 50% as tenant by the entirety with Hunter. So she has 50% of the tract.

Brandon: owns 25% as joint tenant with Hunter. So he has 25% of the tract.

Wait, no. Wait, the first sale was 50% to Hunter and Willa as tenants by the entirety. So each of them owns the entire 50% as a joint interest. Then, the second sale is the remaining 50% to Hunter and Brandon as joint tenants. So Hunter and Brandon each own 25% of the tract because they split the 50% equally.

So, prior to the deaths:

- Hunter's total interest: 50% (from the first sale) + 25% (from the second sale) = 75%.

- Willa's interest: 50% as tenant by the entirety with Hunter.

- Brandon's interest: 25% as joint tenant with Hunter.

On August 1, 2007, all three—Hunter, Willa, and Brandon—die in a common disaster, and the order of death can't be established.

Now, we need to look at what happens to each of their interests.

Starting with the first deed: Hunter and Willa as tenants by the entirety. In a tenancy by the entirety, if both die simultaneously, their interests don't pass by survivorship. Instead, their shares go through their respective estates. So each of their 50% interests would be subject to their wills. But wait, the deed was to them as tenants by the entirety, so their ownership is such that each owns the entire 50%, but if one dies, the other takes their share. But since they both died at the same time, the survivorship doesn't apply. So each of their 50% interests would pass through their wills.

Hunter's will devises whatever interest he has to his son. Similarly, Willa's will also devises her interest to the son.

But wait, in the first deed,Hunter and Willa each had a 50% interest as tenants by the entirety. So when both die, each of their 50% shares would go to their respective heirs. But under the deed, their ownership was as tenants by the entirety, so if one predeceased the other, the survivor would take the entire 50%. But since they died together, neither survives the other. So their interests would pass through their wills.

So, Hunter's 50% interest (from the first sale) would go to his son, and Willa's 50% interest would go to her son. But wait, does the will take effect on her interest? Wait, the wills devise whatever interest is subject to disposition by wills. So if the tenancy by the entirety was a joint interest, perhaps each had a life estate or something. Wait, no, tenancy by the entirety is a form of joint ownership where each has an equal, undivided interest, and the right of survivorship. But if both die simultaneously, their interests don't pass via survivorship, so their interests are part of their estates.

So Hunter's 50% would go to his son, and Willa's 50% would go to her son.

Now, looking at the second deed: Hunter and Brandon as joint tenants. So they each own 25% of the tract. As joint tenants, if one dies, the survivor takes the deceased's share. But since both died simultaneously, neither survives the other. So their interests would also pass through their estates.

Hunter's 25% would go to his son, and Brandon's 25% would go to his estate, which would presumably go to his heirs. But the question is about the son's interest. So the son would receive Hunter's 25% from the second sale.

Wait, but let's clarify:

From the first sale:

- Hunter and Willa each have a 50% interest as tenants by the entirety. So when both die, each of their 50% goes to their respective wills. So the son of Hunter gets Hunter's 50%, and the son of Willa gets Willa's 50%.

From the second sale:

- Hunter and Brandon are joint tenants on 50% of the land, so each has a 25% interest. When both die, their interests go through their estates. So Hunter's 25% goes to his son, and Brandon's 25% goes to his heirs. So the son of Hunter would get another 25% from this.

So the son of Hunter gets 50% (from the first sale) plus 25% (from the second sale), totaling 75%. The son of Willa gets 50%, and the son of Brandon (if any) would get 25%. But the question is, the son owns... So the son in question is Hunter's son, I think. Because the wills of Hunter and Willa devise to their sons. So Hunter's son gets 75%, and Willa's son gets 50%.

Wait, but the question says, "Hunter's will and Willa's will devise whatever interest in the land in question that is subject to disposition by their wills to their son." So each of their wills gives their son their own share.

So the total would be:

- Hunter's will gives his son 50% (from the first sale) + 25% (from the second sale) = 75%.

- Willa's will gives her son 50% (from the first sale).

But wait, the first sale was 50% owned by Hunter and Willa as tenants by the entirety. So when both die, their 50% interests would pass to their respective wills. So the son of Hunter gets Hunter's 50%, and the son of Willa gets Willa's 50%. But since the land is 100%, the son of Hunter would have 50%, and the son of Willa would have another 50%. But that can't be right because the second sale adds another 50% to the son of Hunter.

Wait, no. Let me clarify:

Total land is 100%.

After first sale: Hunter and Willa own 50% as tenants by the entirety. So each has 50% in the 50%, but as a joint interest. Then, the second sale: Hunter and Brandon own the remaining 50% as joint tenants. So each has 25% in the 50%, making each 25% of the total.

So:

- From first sale: Hunter and Willa each have 50% of the 50%, so each has 25% of the total.

Wait, no. Wait, if you own 50% as tenants by the entirety, each owns 100% of that 50%, but that's a bit abstract. So perhaps it's better to think of their ownership as each having a 50% undivided interest in the tract, but with the right of survivorship. So if one dies, the other gets their share. But since both died, their shares go to their estates.

So, Hunter's 50% goes to his son via his will, and Willa's 50% goes to her son via her will. Then, the second sale: Hunter and Brandon own 50% as joint tenants. So each has a 25% interest in the tract. When both die, their interests go to their estates. So Hunter's 25% goes to his son, and Brandon's 25% goes to his heirs (probably his brother, but the question doesn't specify).

So, the son of Hunter would receive:

- 50% from the first sale (Hunter's interest as tenant by the entirety) via his will, plus

- 25% from the second sale (Hunter's joint tenancy interest) via his will.

Total: 75%.

The son of Willa would receive 50% from the first sale.

Brandon's 25% would go to his heirs, but since the question only asks about the son (Hunter's son), the answer would be that the son owns 75% of the land.

Looking at the options, option H is three-quarters interest, which is 75%.

Wait, but let me double-check. Is the first sale 50% to Hunter and Willa as tenants by the entirety. So each has a 50% interest in the 50%, meaning each has 25% of the total. But as tenants by the entirety, their ownership is such that each owns the whole 50%, but since both die, each's 50% goes to their wills. So Hunter's will gives his 50% to his son, and Willa's will gives her 50% to her son.

Then, in the second sale, Hunter and Brandon own the remaining 50% as joint tenants. So each has 25% of the total. When both die, their 25% goes to their estates. So Hunter's 25% goes to his son, and Brandon's 25% goes elsewhere.

So the son's total from Hunter's will is 50% (from first sale) plus 25% (from second sale) = 75%.

So the correct answer is H: an undivided three-quarters interest in the land.
</think>

The son of Hunter owns an undivided three-quarters interest in the land. This is because Hunter's will devises his 50% interest from the first sale and his 25% interest from the second sale to his son, totaling 75% of the tract.

Answer: H
