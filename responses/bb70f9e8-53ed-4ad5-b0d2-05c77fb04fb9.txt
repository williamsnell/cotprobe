Okay, so I have this economics problem to solve. Let me try to understand it step by step. The question is about calculating the current deficit and the full employment deficit, then comparing them and determining whether the current budget is expansionary or contractionary. 

First, I'll list out the given data:

- Households save 10% of their incomes.
- Current income tax burden is 25%.
- Planned investments are $60 billion.
- Trade deficit is $2.5 billion.
- Government expenditures are $270 billion per year.
- Full capacity GNP is $1,060 billion.

Wait, the question mentions "current deficit" and "full employment deficit." I think these refer to the government budget deficit. So, I need to calculate two things: the current budget deficit and the full employment budget deficit. Then compare them and see if the current budget is expansionary or contractionary.

Let me recall what the budget deficit is. The budget deficit is the difference between government expenditures and government revenues. Government revenues mainly come from taxes, like income tax in this case. 

So, the formula for the budget deficit is:

Budget Deficit = Government Expenditures - Government Revenues

But government revenues here are taxes, which are 25% of income. So, I need to find the current level of income (GNP) and then calculate the tax revenues. But wait, I don't have the current GNP. Hmm, I might need to find the current GNP first.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Keynesian model to find the equilibrium GNP. Because in equilibrium, GNP is determined by the total demand, which is Consumption + Investment + Government Spending - Trade Deficit. Wait, the trade deficit is a negative in the expenditure approach. Let me get that straight.

The expenditure approach to GNP is:

GNP = Consumption + Investment + Government Spending + Net Exports

But Net Exports = Exports - Imports. If there's a trade deficit, that means Imports > Exports, so Net Exports = -Trade Deficit. So in this case, Net Exports would be -$2.5 billion.

So, GNP = C + I + G + (X - M). Here, since there's a trade deficit, X - M = -2.5 billion.

Now, I need to find Consumption. Households save 10% of their income, so the saving rate is 10%. That means the marginal propensity to save ( MPS ) is 0.10. Therefore, the marginal propensity to consume ( MPC ) is 1 - MPS = 0.90.

But to find Consumption, I think I need the disposable income. Wait, no, because in the basic Keynesian model, Consumption is a function of disposable income. But in this case, perhaps we can model it as C = a + b(Y - T), where a is autonomous consumption, and b is MPC. But wait, I might be overcomplicating. Alternatively, since the saving rate is 10%, that implies that for every dollar of income, 10% is saved, so 90% is consumed. So, C = 0.9(Y - T), where Y is GNP, and T is taxes.

Wait, but taxes are 25% of income. So T = 0.25Y.

So, C = 0.9(Y - 0.25Y) = 0.9(0.75Y) = 0.675Y.

Now, the equilibrium condition is Y = C + I + G + Net Exports.

Plugging in the numbers:

Y = 0.675Y + 60 + 270 - 2.5

Let me calculate the constants: 60 + 270 = 330; 330 - 2.5 = 327.5.

So, Y = 0.675Y + 327.5

Subtract 0.675Y from both sides:

Y - 0.675Y = 327.5

0.325Y = 327.5

So Y = 327.5 / 0.325

Let me compute that. 327.5 divided by 0.325.

Hmm, 327.5 รท 0.325. Let me see: 0.325 is 13/40. So 327.5 รท (13/40) = 327.5 * (40/13).

Calculate 327.5 *40 = 13,100.

13,100 รท13 is 1,007.692... Approximately 1,007.69 billion.

Wait, but the full capacity GNP is given as $1,060 billion. So the current GNP is about $1,007.69 billion, which is below full capacity. So the economy is in a recession.

Now, to find the current budget deficit, I need to compute Government Expenditures minus Government Revenues.

Government Expenditures (G) = $270 billion.

Government Revenues (T) = 0.25 * Y. Y is approximately $1,007.69 billion.

So T = 0.25 * 1,007.69 = 251.9225 billion.

Thus, Budget Deficit = G - T = 270 - 251.9225 = 18.0775 billion. So approximately $18.08 billion.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is $18.07 billion, which matches this.

Next, the full employment deficit. Full employment occurs at full capacity GNP of $1,060 billion.

So, in full employment, Y = 1,060.

Compute T at Y = 1,060: T = 0.25 * 1,060 = 265 billion.

So, Government Expenditures are still $270 billion.

So, Full Employment Budget Deficit = G - T = 270 - 265 = $5 billion.

Wait, but that doesn't match any of the options. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should consider the full employment budget in a different way. Let me think again.

Wait, in the full employment scenario, the government might adjust its spending to match the full capacity GNP. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the full employment budget deficit based on the same G and T at Y=1,060.

Wait, but the question is asking for the full employment deficit, which is the deficit when the economy is at full capacity. So, using Y=1,060, T=265, G=270, so deficit is 5 billion. But looking at the options, I don't see 5 billion. The options are A:18.07, B:12.5, C:22.3, D:30, E:10, F:15, G:35, H:20, I:25, J:17.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the structural deficit, which is the deficit when the economy is at full capacity. Wait, no, the question is asking for the current deficit and the full employment deficit.

Wait, let me re-express the problem. The current GNP is Y1 = 1,007.69, and the full capacity is Y2 = 1,060.

The current deficit is 18.07 billion, as I found earlier.

The full employment deficit would be the deficit when Y=1,060.

So, G is still 270, T = 0.25*1,060 = 265.

So, deficit is 270 - 265 = 5 billion.

But that's not one of the options. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use a different approach. Let me try to model the problem again.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the full employment budget as the deficit when the economy is at full capacity, but with the same level of government spending and taxes. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the full employment deficit using the same G and T as in the current scenario, but at full capacity Y.

Wait, but the current GNP is lower than full capacity, so the tax revenues are lower, and the deficit is higher.

Wait, in my initial calculation, the current deficit is $18.07 billion, which is option A.

The full employment deficit would be when Y is 1,060. So, T = 0.25 *1,060 = 265.

G is still 270. So deficit is 5 billion.

But that's not an option. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the structural deficit, which is the deficit when the economy is at full capacity. So, the current deficit is $18.07, and the full employment deficit is $5.

But the options don't include $5. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the full employment deficit as the deficit when Y is at full capacity, but the government spending is adjusted to match that. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the full employment deficit using the same formula but at Y=1,060.

Wait, maybe I should compute the full employment deficit using the same approach as the current deficit but at Y=1,060.

So, let's compute the full employment deficit.

At full capacity, Y=1,060.

T = 0.25 *1,060 =265.

G=270.

So, deficit = 270 -265 =5.

But 5 isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the full employment deficit in a different way. Let me think again about the model.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the full employment deficit using the same formula but in the context of the full capacity GNP. So, perhaps I need to find the full employment budget deficit, which is the deficit when the economy is at full capacity, which is Y=1,060.

Wait, but according to my calculation, that's 5 billion, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the balanced budget multiplier or something else. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the fiscal balance at full capacity.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the cyclically adjusted budget. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that at full capacity, the government might adjust its spending to eliminate the deficit, but that's not the case here.

Wait, another approach: the current deficit is $18.07 billion, as calculated. The full employment deficit would be the deficit if the economy were at full capacity, so Y=1,060.

So, T = 265, G=270, so deficit is 5 billion.

Comparing the two, the current deficit is higher than the full employment deficit. Wait, no, because when the economy is at full capacity, Y is higher, so T is higher, leading to a smaller deficit. So, current deficit is $18.07, full employment deficit is $5.

Wait, but the question says, "What is the current deficit? What is the full employment deficit? Compare the two."

So, the current deficit is larger than the full employment deficit. So, the current budget is contractionary because the deficit is higher than the full employment deficit. Wait, no, actually, when the economy is below full capacity, a higher deficit suggests that the government is spending more than it's taxing, which is expansionary. But wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, in Keynesian economics, a budget deficit occurs when G > T. If the deficit is higher than the full employment deficit, it's considered expansionary because it's stimulating the economy beyond what's needed at full capacity. So, in this case, current deficit is $18.07, full employment is $5. So, the current deficit is larger, meaning the budget is expansionary.

But wait, let me double-check. At full capacity, the deficit is $5 billion. If the current deficit is $18.07, which is higher, that means the government is spending more relative to taxes than it would at full capacity. So, this suggests an expansionary policy, as it's trying to stimulate the economy beyond what's needed at full capacity.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the full employment deficit could be negative, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps I should look back at the options. The current deficit is $18.07, which is option A. The full employment deficit is $5, which isn't an option. So perhaps the question is only asking for the current deficit, and the rest is extra. But the question clearly asks for both.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the full employment deficit. Let me try again.

Wait, perhaps the full employment deficit is calculated differently. Let me think about the government's budget balance.

At full employment, Y = 1,060.

T = 0.25 *1,060 =265.

G=270.

So, deficit = 270 -265=5 billion.

But perhaps the question is considering the full employment deficit as the deficit when the economy is at full capacity, but the government has adjusted its spending to match that. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the full employment deficit using the same approach as the current deficit but at Y=1,060.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the full employment deficit as the difference between G and T at Y=1,060.

So, as before, that's 5 billion.

But since that's not an option, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the full employment deficit using the same approach as the current deficit but at Y=1,060.

Wait, let me try that again.

At Y=1,060:

C = 0.675 *1,060 = 711.5 billion.

I=60 billion.

G=270 billion.

Net Exports= -2.5 billion.

So, total expenditure = 711.5 +60 +270 -2.5 = 1,040 billion.

But Y is 1,060, so there's a deficit of 1,060 -1,040 =20 billion. Wait, no, that's not right because in equilibrium, Y equals total expenditure. Wait, no, that's not the way to calculate the deficit.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

The budget deficit is G - T. So, at Y=1,060, T=265, G=270, so deficit=5 billion.

But perhaps the question is asking for the cyclically adjusted deficit, which is the deficit at full capacity. So, in that case, it's 5 billion.

But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the full employment deficit using the same formula as the current deficit but at Y=1,060.

Wait, perhaps I should find the equilibrium GNP first, which I did as 1,007.69, and then compute the deficit.

But the question is about the current deficit and the full employment deficit.

So, perhaps the answer is that the current deficit is $18.07 billion (option A), and the full employment deficit is $5 billion, which isn't listed. But since the options don't include $5, perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the full employment deficit is zero, meaning the government is running a balanced budget at full capacity. But that's not the case here because G=270 and T=265, so deficit is 5 billion.

Wait, perhaps I should check my calculations again.

Let me recalculate the current GNP.

Y = C + I + G + Net Exports.

C = 0.9*(Y - 0.25Y) = 0.675Y.

So, Y = 0.675Y + 60 +270 -2.5.

Y = 0.675Y + 327.5.

Y - 0.675Y = 327.5.

0.325Y =327.5.

Y =327.5 /0.325.

Let me compute that again.

0.325 is equal to 13/40.

So, 327.5 รท (13/40) =327.5 * (40/13).

327.5 *40 =13,100.

13,100 รท13 =1,007.6923, which is approximately 1,007.69 billion.

So, current GNP is 1,007.69.

T=0.25*1,007.69=251.9225.

G=270.

So, deficit=270-251.9225=18.0775, which is approximately 18.08 billion, so option A.

At full capacity, Y=1,060.

T=0.25*1,060=265.

G=270.

Deficit=5 billion.

So, the current deficit is 18.0775, and the full employment deficit is 5.

Comparing the two, the current deficit is larger than the full employment deficit, meaning the current budget is expansionary because it's running a larger deficit than needed at full capacity, which implies it's stimulating the economy beyond what's needed, leading to potential inflationary pressures.

Wait, but in reality, when the economy is below full capacity, a higher deficit could be considered expansionary because the government is spending more than it's taxing, putting more money into the economy to stimulate demand.

So, the current budget is expansionary because the deficit is higher than the full employment deficit, meaning it's providing more stimulus than needed to maintain full employment.

Therefore, the current deficit is approximately $18.07 billion (option A), the full employment deficit is $5 billion, and the current budget is expansionary.
</think>

The current deficit is calculated as Government Expenditures minus Government Revenues. Using the given data, the equilibrium GNP is approximately $1,007.69 billion. Government revenues (taxes) at this level are $251.92 billion, and government expenditures are $270 billion. Thus, the current deficit is $18.07 billion (Option A).

At full capacity GNP ($1,060 billion), taxes amount to $265 billion, and government expenditures remain $270 billion. This results in a full employment deficit of $5 billion. Comparing the two, the current deficit ($18.07 billion) is larger than the full employment deficit ($5 billion), indicating that the current budget is expansionary as it provides additional stimulus to the economy beyond what is needed at full capacity.
