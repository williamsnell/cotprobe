Question:

Mr. Haskell has decided to buy a rental property. The building costs $50,000 and the land costs $30,000. The annual rent income is estimated to be $10,450 and the annual expense, $3,200. Mr. Haskell plans to depreciate the building by the straight line method over 40 years. Mr. Haskell wants to choose the best of three investment plans. Plan A Pay the full $80,000 from personal account. Plan B Borrow $30,000 and pay $50,000 from personal account. Rate of interest is 4(1/2)%. Plan C Borrow $60,000 and pay $20,000 from personal account. Rate of interest is 5 (1/4)%. If the tax rate is 40%, which investment plan has the highest rate of return?

Options:

A: Plan B, if the interest rates drop to 3%
B: Plan A, if the tax rate decreases to 30%
C: Plan A
D: Plan C, assuming rental income increases by 5% annually
E: Plan C
F: None of the plans
G: Plan B
H: Plan C, if additional tax deductions are available for interest paid
I: Plan A, with a government grant covering 10% of the initial investment
J: Plan B, with an additional private investor contributing $10,000

Okay, so I've got this problem about Mr. Haskell buying a rental property, and I need to figure out which investment plan gives him the highest rate of return. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the building costs $50k and the land is $30k, so the total initial investment is $80k. The annual rent income is $10,450, and the expenses are $3,200. So, the net rental income before any depreciation or taxes would be $10,450 minus $3,200, which is $7,250.

Now, Mr. Haskell has three plans to finance this. Let's go through each one.

Plan A: He pays the full $80k from his personal account. So, no debt here. The depreciation is on the building only, which is $50k over 40 years. That means annual depreciation is $50k / 40 = $1,250. So each year, he can deduct $1,250 from his taxable income.

Plan B: He borrows $30k and pays $50k from his own money. The interest rate is 4.5%. So, the interest each year would be 4.5% of $30k, which is $1,350. Additionally, he can still depreciate the building at $1,250 per year. So his total deductions would be $1,350 (interest) + $1,250 (depreciation) = $2,600. 

Plan C: He borrows $60k and pays $20k from his own account. The interest rate is 5.25%. So, the interest each year is 5.25% of $60k, which is $3,150. Depreciation is still $1,250, so total deductions are $3,150 + $1,250 = $4,400.

Now, the tax rate is 40%. So, we need to calculate the taxable income for each plan after deductions and then apply the tax.

Let's compute taxable income for each plan:

Plan A:
Net rental income: $7,250
Minus depreciation: $1,250
Taxable income = $7,250 - $1,250 = $6,000
Tax = 40% of $6,000 = $2,400
So, after-tax income = $7,250 - $2,400 = $4,850

Plan B:
Net rental income: $7,250
Minus depreciation: $1,250
Minus interest: $1,350
Total deductions: $2,600
Taxable income = $7,250 - $2,600 = $4,650
Tax = 40% of $4,650 = $1,860
After-tax income = $7,250 - $1,860 = $5,390

Plan C:
Net rental income: $7,250
Minus depreciation: $1,250
Minus interest: $3,150
Total deductions: $4,400
Taxable income = $7,250 - $4,400 = $2,850
Tax = 40% of $2,850 = $1,140
After-tax income = $7,250 - $1,140 = $6,110

So, the after-tax incomes are:
A: $4,850
B: $5,390
C: $6,110

Looking at these numbers, Plan C gives the highest after-tax income. Now, considering the options, the question is which plan has the highest rate of return. The rate of return would depend on the after-tax income relative to the initial investment.

Let's calculate the return on investment (ROI) for each plan.

Plan A: Initial investment is $80k. After-tax income is $4,850. ROI = ($4,850 / $80,000) * 100 ≈ 6.06%

Plan B: He borrowed $30k and paid $50k. His personal investment is $50k. After-tax income is $5,390. ROI on his investment = ($5,390 / $50,000) * 100 ≈ 10.78%

Plan C: He borrowed $60k and paid $20k. His personal investment is $20k. After-tax income is $6,110. ROI on his investment = ($6,110 / $20,000) * 100 ≈ 30.55%

So, Plan C gives the highest ROI. Now, looking at the options, the correct answer is E: Plan C.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are:

E: Plan C
F: None of the plans
...others are conditional.

But the question is, which plan has the highest rate of return? Based on the calculations, Plan C has the highest ROI, so E should be the correct answer.

Wait, but in the options, E is Plan C, so yes, that's it.

The calculations show that Plan C provides the highest after-tax income and the highest ROI based on personal investment. 

Answer: E
