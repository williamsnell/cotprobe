Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here about calculating the ratio of the specific heats of air. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through this step by step.

The question gives me that air is treated as an ideal gas, which is a good starting point. They mention that at sea level and STP, the velocity of sound in air is 334 m/s. Also, the molecular weight of air is 28.8 g/mol. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, I remember that the speed of sound in an ideal gas is related to the specific heats. The formula, I think, is something like v = sqrt(gamma * R * T / M), where gamma is the ratio of specific heats (Cp/Cv), R is the universal gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. Oh, but wait, STP conditions are standard temperature and pressure, right? So T should be 273 K, and pressure is 1 atm.

Let me jot down the formula:

v = sqrt( (gamma * R * T) / M )

I need to find gamma, given v, R, T, and M. Rearranging the formula, gamma would be:

gamma = (v^2 * M) / (R * T)

I think R is the universal gas constant. Wait, what's the value of R? I remember R is 8.314 J/mol·K. But wait, sometimes it's expressed in different units, like 8.314 m^3·Pa/mol·K, but since pressure is in Pascals (Pa), which is N/m², and velocity is in m/s, the units should work out.

Given:
v = 334 m/s
M = 28.8 g/mol → which is 0.0288 kg/mol
T = 273 K
R = 8.314 J/mol·K

Plugging the numbers into the equation:

gamma = (334^2 * 0.0288) / (8.314 * 273)

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, calculate 334 squared. 334 * 334. Let me compute that. 300^2 is 90,000. 34^2 is 1,156. Then, 2*300*34 = 20,400. So total is 90,000 +20,400 +1,156 = 111,556. So 334² = 111,556 (m²/s²).

Next, multiply by M: 111,556 * 0.0288. Let me compute that. 111,556 * 0.03 is about 3,346.68, but since it's 0.0288, which is 0.03 - 0.0012, so 3,346.68 - (111,556 * 0.0012). 111,556 * 0.0012 is about 133.8672. So 3,346.68 - 133.8672 = 3,212.8128.

Now, the denominator: R*T = 8.314 * 273. Let me calculate that. 8 * 273 = 2,184, 0.314*273 is approximately 85.722. So total is about 2,184 + 85.722 = 2,269.722 J/mol.

So now, gamma is 3,212.8128 divided by 2,269.722.

Let me compute that division. 3,212.8128 / 2,269.722 ≈ let's see, 2,269.722 * 1.4 is 3,177.6108. Hmm, 3,212.8128 - 3,177.6108 = 35.202. So that's about 1.4 plus 35.202 / 2,269.722. 35.202 / 2,269.722 is roughly 0.0155. So total gamma ≈ 1.4155.

Looking at the options, option G is 1.415. That seems to match.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I might have made a mistake in the units. Because M is given in g/mol, but I converted it to kg/mol by dividing by 1000, which is correct because 1 g = 0.001 kg. So M = 28.8 g/mol = 0.0288 kg/mol. That part was right.

Another thing to check: the formula for speed of sound in an ideal gas. Is it correct? Let me recall. The speed of sound in an ideal gas is given by v = sqrt( (gamma * R * T) / M ), yes. Because the formula comes from the derivation where the speed depends on the adiabatic index gamma.

So all steps seem correct. So the calculated gamma is approximately 1.415, which is option G.

To calculate the ratio of the specific heats of air (γ = Cp/Cv), we use the formula for the speed of sound in an ideal gas:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma R T}{M}}
\]

Rearranging for γ:

\[
\gamma = \frac{v^2 M}{R T}
\]

Given:
- \( v = 334 \, \text{m/s} \)
- \( M = 28.8 \, \text{g/mol} = 0.0288 \, \text{kg/mol} \)
- \( T = 273 \, \text{K} \)
- \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K} \)

Substituting the values:

\[
\gamma = \frac{(334)^2 \cdot 0.0288}{8.314 \cdot 273}
\]

First, calculate \( v^2 = 334^2 = 111,556 \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2 \).

Then, \( v^2 \cdot M = 111,556 \cdot 0.0288 = 3,212.8128 \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2 \cdot \text{kg/mol} \).

Next, \( R \cdot T = 8.314 \cdot 273 = 2,269.722 \, \text{J/mol} \).

Finally, divide:

\[
\gamma = \frac{3,212.8128}{2,269.722} \approx 1.415
\]

Thus, the ratio of the specific heats of air is approximately 1.415, which corresponds to option G.
