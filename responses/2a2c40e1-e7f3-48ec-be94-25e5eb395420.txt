Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an ultrasonic transducer used in medical diagnosis. The question is about finding the time each oscillation takes and the angular frequency. Hmm, let's break it down.

First, I remember that frequency is the number of oscillations per second. The unit given is Mhz, which stands for megahertz. So 6.7 Mhz means 6.7 million cycles per second. Right, because 1 MHz is 10^6 Hz, so 6.7 MHz is 6.7 x 10^6 Hz.

The first part of the question asks how long each oscillation takes. That's the period, right? The period T is the reciprocal of the frequency f. So the formula is T = 1/f. Let me plug in the numbers. But wait, the frequency is 6.7 x 10^6 Hz, so T would be 1 divided by 6.7e6. Let me calculate that. 

1 divided by 6.7 is approximately 0.14925, and since it's 6.7e6, the period would be 0.14925 x 10^-6 seconds. Wait, 10^-6 is a microsecond. So that's about 0.14925 microseconds. But the options don't seem to have such small numbers. Oh, wait, maybe I'm supposed to express it differently. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in units.

Wait, the options for the period are given in nanoseconds or something? Let me check the options again. The options are A through J, like 5.3, 1.5, etc. Oh wait, the question says the unit for the angular frequency is 10^7 rad/s. So maybe it's asking for the angular frequency, and the first part is a distractor? Or perhaps the question is split into two parts, and the options are for each part. Wait, the question says, "how long does each oscillation take, and what is the angular frequency?" So there are two answers, but the options are a single list. Oh, perhaps the options are for the angular frequency, and the time part is just part of the question. Let me read carefully.

Ah, the way it's written, the question asks for two things: the time per oscillation and the angular frequency. But the options are given as a list, each being a number. Wait, looking again: "Options: A:5.3 ... J:6.7" So perhaps each option is for the angular frequency part, but I'm not sure. Wait, the user's question might have a typo. Let me read again.

Wait, the question says: "How long does each oscillation take, and what is the angular frequency? (Unit: 10^7 rad/s)" So the unit given is for the angular frequency, which would be in 10^7 rad/s. So the angular frequency is to be expressed in units of 10^7 rad/s. So the answer to the angular frequency part would be 6.7 x 10^6 Hz, converted to angular frequency, which is 2π times that.

Wait, angular frequency ω is 2π times the frequency f. So ω = 2πf. So f is 6.7 x10^6 Hz. So ω = 2π * 6.7e6. Let me compute that. 2π is approximately 6.2832. So 6.2832 *6.7e6. Let's calculate:

6.2832 *6.7 = let's see, 6*6.7 is 40.2, 0.2832 *6.7 is about 1.899, so total around 42.099. So 42.099e6 rad/s, which is 4.2099e7 rad/s. So in terms of 10^7 rad/s, that's 4.2099, which is approximately 4.2. So the angular frequency is about 4.2 x10^7 rad/s.

Looking back at the options, option C is 4.2. So that's the answer for the angular frequency part. The time per oscillation is the period, which is 1/f. f is 6.7e6 Hz, so T=1/(6.7e6) seconds. Let me compute that: 1/(6.7) is approx 0.14925, so 0.14925e-6 seconds, which is 0.14925 microseconds. But the options don't have such small numbers. Maybe the question only asks for the angular frequency, and the first part is just part of the setup.

Wait, the way the question is phrased, it's possible that the options are only for the angular frequency. Let me re-examine the question. It says, "how long does each oscillation take, and what is the angular frequency?" So perhaps each option is for the angular frequency, so the correct answer would be 4.2, which is option C.

The ultrasonic transducer operates at 6.7 MHz, which is 6.7 × 10⁶ Hz. The angular frequency is calculated using the formula ω = 2πf. Substituting f = 6.7 × 10⁶ Hz:

\[
\omega = 2\pi \times 6.7 \times 10^6 \approx 42.1 \times 10^6 \, \text{rad/s} = 4.21 \times 10^7 \, \text{rad/s}.
\]

Expressing this in units of 10⁷ rad/s gives approximately 4.2. Therefore, the angular frequency is **4.2 × 10⁷ rad/s**, corresponding to option C.
