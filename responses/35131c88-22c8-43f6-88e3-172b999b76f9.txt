Okay, so I've got this question about the ratio of nonterminal nodes to the total number of nodes in a complete K-ary tree of depth N. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I should remember what a K-ary tree is. A K-ary tree is a tree where each node can have up to K children. A complete K-ary tree would mean that all levels except possibly the last are completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.

The question is asking for the ratio of nonterminal nodes (which are the nodes that aren't leaves) to the total number of nodes. So I need to find two things: how many nonterminal nodes there are, and how many total nodes there are.

Let me think about the structure of a complete K-ary tree. The root is level 0, then level 1 has K nodes, level 2 has K² nodes, and so on until level N-1, which is the last level. Wait, no, wait. Actually, the depth is N, so the tree has N levels, right? Or is depth N meaning the last level is level N? I think depth is the number of levels, so a depth of N means the tree has N levels, with the root being level 1, but wait, sometimes depth is counted starting at 0. I might need to clarify that.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the number of levels. Let's say the tree has depth N, so there are N levels. The root is at level 1, and the leaves are at level N.

In a complete K-ary tree, all levels except possibly the last are completely filled. The last level might have some nodes, but they are all as far left as possible.

Wait, but sometimes definitions vary. Alternatively, maybe depth N refers to the maximum depth of a node, meaning the tree has levels from 0 to N-1, making N levels. So for example, a tree of depth 0 is just the root, depth 1 has the root and its children, etc. I'm a bit confused about the exact definition here.

But perhaps the exact definition doesn't matter as much as the formula for the nodes. Let me recall that in a complete K-ary tree of depth N, the number of nodes can be calculated based on whether the last level is full or not.

Wait, no, a complete K-ary tree is one where all levels except the last are fully filled, and the last level is filled from left to right. So the total number of nodes can be calculated as the sum of a geometric series up to depth N, but the last level might not be full.

Wait, let me think again. The total number of nodes in a complete K-ary tree of depth N is given by the sum from level 0 to level N-1 of K^i, plus the number of nodes in the last level, which is at most K, but depends on how many are needed to complete the tree.

Wait, no, actually, in a complete K-ary tree, all the levels except the last are completely filled. The last level may have between 1 and K nodes. So the total number of nodes is the sum of K^i for i from 0 to N-1, plus m, where m is the number of nodes in the last level, which is less than K.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the ratio of nonterminal nodes to total nodes. Nonterminal nodes are those that have children; in other words, any node that is not a leaf. So the nonterminal nodes are all nodes except those on the last level.

Wait, no, wait. Because in a K-ary tree, a nonterminal node is any node that has at least one child. So in a complete tree, all nodes except the leaves in the last level are nonterminal. So the number of nonterminal nodes would be the total number of nodes minus the number of leaves.

Wait, but wait: the leaves are the nodes in the last level. So the number of nonterminal nodes is the total number of nodes minus the number of leaves.

But let's think about the structure. Each level from 0 to N-2 is completely filled, and the last level (N-1) is filled with some number of nodes. So the number of leaves is equal to the number of nodes in the last level, which is m, where 1 ≤ m ≤ K.

Wait, but in a complete K-ary tree, the last level is filled from left to right, so m can be any number from 1 to K. But for the purpose of finding the ratio, maybe we can find an average case or perhaps consider that m is not affecting the ratio significantly, or perhaps it's negligible when N is large.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is assuming that the tree is full, meaning all levels are completely filled, so the last level has K nodes. But the question says "complete," which usually implies that all levels except the last are full, and the last level is filled from left to right.

Wait, but perhaps for the sake of this problem, it's better to model the complete K-ary tree as having all levels except the last completely filled, and the last level having m nodes, where 1 ≤ m ≤ K.

So, the total number of nodes is the sum from i=0 to i=N-1 of K^i, but wait, that's if all levels are filled, which would make it a perfect K-ary tree. But in a complete tree, the last level might have m nodes, so the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^{N-2} K^i + m.

Wait, because levels 0 to N-2 are completely filled, each level i having K^i nodes, and level N-1 has m nodes, where m ≤ K.

Similarly, the number of nonterminal nodes would be the sum of all nodes that have children. So in a complete tree, the nonterminal nodes are those that are not in the last level, because the last level nodes (leaves) have no children.

Wait, but that's only true if the last level is the bottom level. So if the tree's depth is N, then the last level is level N-1 (if starting from 0), and nodes there are leaves. So the number of nonterminal nodes is the sum of nodes from level 0 to level N-2, which is sum_{i=0}^{N-2} K^i.

Wait, but wait: in a K-ary tree, each node can have up to K children. So a node in level i can have children in level i+1. So any node in level i < N-1 will have K children, except possibly those in the last level, which may have fewer.

Wait, but in a complete tree, all levels except the last are fully filled. So, the number of nonterminal nodes would be the number of nodes in levels 0 to N-2. Because nodes in level N-1 are leaves and have no children.

So the number of nonterminal nodes is sum_{i=0}^{N-2} K^i.

The total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^{N-2} K^i + m, where m is the number of nodes in level N-1, which is between 1 and K.

But to find the ratio of nonterminal to total nodes, let's compute:

Ratio = [sum_{i=0}^{N-2} K^i] / [sum_{i=0}^{N-2} K^i + m]

But I'm not sure if m is significant. Let's see, what happens when N is large. The sum up to N-2 is (K^{N-1} - 1)/(K-1), and m is at most K. So as N becomes large, m becomes negligible compared to the sum, so the ratio approaches [ (K^{N-1} - 1)/(K-1) ) ] / [ (K^{N-1} - 1)/(K-1) + m ] ≈ (K^{N-1} )/(K^{N-1}) ) → 1 as N increases. But that doesn't make sense because if all nodes except the last level are nonterminal, the ratio would be around (sum up to N-2)/(sum up to N-1), which is ( (K^{N-1} -1)/(K-1) ) / ( (K^{N} -1)/(K-1) ) ) = K^{N-1}/(K^N) = 1/K. But wait, that's only if the last level is completely filled, i.e., m=K.

Wait, but the question is about a complete K-ary tree, which may not have the last level fully filled. So perhaps the assumption is that the last level is not fully filled, but the sum would be up to N-1 with m nodes.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the tree is a perfect K-ary tree, where all levels are fully filled, including the last. In that case, the total number of nodes is (K^{N} - 1)/(K-1), and the number of nonterminal nodes is (K^{N-1} - 1)/(K-1), because the last level (Nth level) is the leaves.

Wait, that makes sense. Let me test this with small examples.

Let's take K=2, N=2.

In a perfect binary tree of depth 2, the root is level 0, then level 1 has 2 nodes, level 2 has 4 nodes. Wait, no, depth N=2 would have levels 0, 1, 2. So total nodes would be 1 + 2 + 4 =7. Nonterminal nodes are those in levels 0 and 1: 1 + 2 =3. So ratio is 3/7 ≈ 0.428.

But let's compute using the formula: nonterminal nodes = (2^{2} -1)/(2-1) = (4-1)/1=3, total nodes=(2^{3}-1)/(2-1)=7. So ratio 3/7.

Now, the options given are:

A: N/K → 2/2=1 → 3/7 ≈ 0.428, so no.

B: (N-1)/K → 1/2=0.5 → close but not exactly.

Wait, but maybe for a perfect tree, the ratio would be (K^{N-1} -1)/(K^{N} -1) → for K=2, N=2, that's (4-1)/(8-1)=3/7, which matches. So the ratio is (K^{N-1} -1)/(K^{N} -1) → which can be simplified as (K^{N-1} -1)/(K(K^{N-1} -1/(K)) ? Wait, maybe not. Let's compute it: (K^{N-1} -1)/(K^N -1) = [K^{N-1} -1]/[K^{N-1} * K -1] = [K^{N-1} -1]/[K^{N} -1].

Hmm, but perhaps for large N, this approaches 1/K. Because as N increases, K^{N} dominates K^{N-1}, so the ratio approaches K^{N-1}/K^N = 1/K.

But in the question, the tree is complete, not necessarily perfect. So the last level may not be full. So in that case, the number of nonterminal nodes would be the sum up to level N-2, and the total nodes would be sum up to N-2 plus m, where m is the number of nodes in the last level, which is between 1 and K.

So the ratio becomes [sum_{i=0}^{N-2} K^i] / [sum_{i=0}^{N-2} K^i + m].

The sum up to N-2 is S = (K^{N-1} -1)/(K-1). The total nodes are S + m.

So the ratio is S/(S + m).

Now, when m is much smaller than S, which is the case when N is large, this ratio approaches S/(S) = 1, but that can't be right because in a complete tree, some of the last level nodes are leaves, so the ratio would be less than that.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of it differently. The number of nonterminal nodes in a complete K-ary tree is equal to the total number of nodes minus the number of leaves.

The number of leaves in a complete K-ary tree is equal to the number of nodes in the last level, which is m, where m ≤ K.

But in a complete K-ary tree, the last level is filled as much as possible, so m can be from 1 to K.

But perhaps the question is assuming that the tree is full, i.e., the last level is completely filled, making it a perfect tree. In that case, the number of leaves is K^{N-1}, and the total nodes is (K^N -1)/(K-1).

Wait, wait, perhaps I should think about the general formula for a complete K-ary tree of depth N, where the last level has m nodes. Then the total nodes are S + m, where S is the sum up to N-1 (if the tree is depth N, perhaps I'm getting confused again).

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the tree as having N levels, with levels 1 to N. Then the number of nodes in level i is K^{i-1}, except for the last level, which has m nodes where 1 ≤ m ≤ K.

So the total number of nodes is sum_{i=1}^{N-1} K^{i-1} + m = (K^{N-1} -1)/(K-1) + m.

The number of nonterminal nodes would be all nodes except those in the last level, so sum_{i=1}^{N-1} K^{i-1} = (K^{N-1} -1)/(K-1).

So the ratio is [ (K^{N-1} -1)/(K-1) ] / [ (K^{N-1} -1)/(K-1) + m ].

But m can vary, so perhaps the question is looking for an approximation that doesn't depend on m. Alternatively, perhaps the tree is a perfect tree, so m=K^{N-1}.

Wait, that can't be, because in a perfect tree, the depth N would have the last level completely filled with K^{N-1} nodes. But then the total nodes would be (K^N -1)/(K-1), and nonterminal nodes would be (K^{N-1} -1)/(K-1), making the ratio (K^{N-1} -1)/(K^N -1) → 1/K as N becomes large.

But the options don't have 1/K as the ratio. Wait, looking back, option J is 1/K. So perhaps the answer is J.

Wait, but let's test with N=2, K=2. If the tree is perfect, then nonterminal nodes are 3, total nodes 7. The ratio is 3/7 ≈0.428. 1/K is 0.5. Not exact, but for larger N, it approaches 1/K.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the ratio is approximately (K-1)/K, which is option C. Wait, no, option C is (K-1)/K. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think of the ratio as the number of nonterminal nodes divided by the total nodes.

In a complete K-ary tree of depth N, the number of nonterminal nodes is the sum of all nodes except the last level. So the number of nonterminal nodes is sum_{i=0}^{N-2} K^i.

The total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^{N-2} K^i + m, where m is the number of nodes in the last level.

So the ratio is [sum_{i=0}^{N-2} K^i] / [sum_{i=0}^{N-2} K^i + m].

But sum_{i=0}^{N-2} K^i = (K^{N-1} -1)/(K-1).

The total nodes are S + m = (K^{N-1} -1)/(K-1) + m.

So the ratio R = S/(S + m) = [ (K^{N-1} -1)/(K-1) ] / [ (K^{N-1} -1)/(K-1) + m ].

Now, if m is less than K, say m is much smaller than S, then S + m ≈ S (1 + m/S), so R ≈ S/(S + m) ≈ 1/(1 + m/S) ≈ 1 - m/S.

But if m is on the order of K, and S is on the order of K^{N-1}, then m/S is negligible, and R ≈ 1. But that can't be correct because in a complete tree, the ratio should be less than 1.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the structure again. The nonterminal nodes are all nodes except the leaves. The total number of nodes is the sum of all levels.

In a complete K-ary tree, the number of leaves is m, where m ≤ K. So the number of nonterminal nodes is total nodes - m.

Wait, but the total nodes would be sum_{i=0}^{N-1} K^i if the tree is perfect, but in a complete tree, it's sum_{i=0}^{N-2} K^i + m.

So the ratio is [sum_{i=0}^{N-2} K^i] / [sum_{i=0}^{N-2} K^i + m].

But sum_{i=0}^{N-2} K^i = (K^{N-1} -1)/(K-1).

So the ratio R = [ (K^{N-1} -1)/(K-1) ] / [ (K^{N-1} -1)/(K-1) + m ].

If the tree is complete, m is the number of nodes in the last level, which can be as low as 1, up to K.

But perhaps the question is looking for an approximate ratio that holds for large N. Let's see, for large N, K^{N-1} is much larger than m, so the ratio approaches [K^{N-1}/(K-1)] / [K^{N-1}/(K-1) + m] ≈ 1/(1 + (m (K-1))/K^{N-1}) ) → 1 as N becomes large. But that can't be right because the ratio should be less than 1.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a key insight. Let me think differently.

In a complete K-ary tree, the number of nonterminal nodes is equal to the number of internal nodes, which is the total number of nodes minus the number of leaves. So, nonterminal nodes = total nodes - leaves.

The number of leaves in a complete K-ary tree is equal to the number of nodes in the last level, which is m, where 1 ≤ m ≤ K.

So, nonterminal nodes = (sum_{i=0}^{N-2} K^i).

Total nodes = sum_{i=0}^{N-2} K^i + m.

So the ratio is [sum_{i=0}^{N-2} K^i ] / [sum_{i=0}^{N-2} K^i + m ].

Now, sum_{i=0}^{N-2} K^i = (K^{N-1} - 1)/(K-1).

So the ratio is R = [ (K^{N-1} - 1)/(K-1) ] / [ (K^{N-1} - 1)/(K-1) + m ].

If m is small compared to K^{N-1}, then R ≈ 1. But that's only if m is negligible, which may not be the case for a complete tree.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the tree is full, i.e., all levels are completely filled, including the last. In that case, m = K^{N-1}, and the total nodes are sum_{i=0}^{N-1} K^i = (K^N -1)/(K-1).

Nonterminal nodes would then be sum_{i=0}^{N-2} K^i = (K^{N-1} -1)/(K-1).

So the ratio R = [ (K^{N-1} -1)/(K-1) ] / [ (K^N -1)/(K-1) ) ] = (K^{N-1} -1) / (K^N -1) = [K^{N-1} (1 - 1/K^{N-1})] / [K^N (1 - 1/K^N)} ] → approximately (1/K) as N becomes large.

Wait, but for N=2, K=2, this would give (4-1)/(8-1) = 3/7 ≈0.428, which is less than 1/2=0.5.

Hmm, but the options don't have 1/K as an option for the ratio except option J.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Options are:

A: N/K

B: (N-1)/K

C: (K-1)/K

D: N-1/m

E: log_10 (1/N)

F: 1/N

G: (K-1)/N

H: K/N

I: 1/(K-1)

J: 1/K

So option J is 1/K. So for large N, the ratio approaches 1/K, which would be option J.

But in the case where the tree is complete but not full, the ratio would be less than 1/K, but perhaps the question is approximating it as 1/K.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to note that in a complete K-ary tree of depth N, the number of nonterminal nodes is equal to the total number of nodes minus the number of leaves. The number of leaves is between 1 and K. So the ratio is (total - leaves)/total = 1 - (leaves/total). If leaves are m, then leaves/total is m/(sum up to N-2 + m).

But again, for large N, sum up to N-2 is much larger than m, so leaves/total approaches m/(sum up to N-2) ≈ m/(K^{N-1}/(K-1)) → which is negligible, making the ratio approach 1. But that doesn't fit with the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the structure. Let me think again.

In a K-ary tree, the number of nonterminal nodes is the number of nodes that have at least one child. So in a complete tree, all nodes except those in the last level are nonterminal. Because the last level is the leaves.

So the number of nonterminal nodes is the sum of all nodes except the last level.

So, number of nonterminal nodes = sum_{i=0}^{N-2} K^i.

Total nodes = sum_{i=0}^{N-2} K^i + m, where m is the number of nodes in the last level, which can be from 1 to K.

So the ratio R = [sum_{i=0}^{N-2} K^i ] / [sum_{i=0}^{N-2} K^i + m ].

Now, sum_{i=0}^{N-2} K^i = (K^{N-1} - 1)/(K-1).

So R = [ (K^{N-1} -1)/(K-1) ] / [ (K^{N-1} -1)/(K-1) + m ].

If m is small compared to the sum, then R ≈ 1. But that can't be the case, so perhaps the question is assuming that the tree is full, which would make m = K^{N-1}.

Wait, no, wait. If the tree is of depth N, and it's a complete K-ary tree, then the last level has m nodes, where m is between 1 and K.

But in that case, the sum up to N-2 is (K^{N-1} -1)/(K-1), and the total nodes are S + m, where S = sum up to N-2.

So R = S/(S + m).

If m is small, then R ≈ 1 - m/(S + m) ≈ 1 - m/S.

But for a complete tree, m can be up to K, so m/S is up to K/(K^{N-1}/(K-1)) ), which is (K*(K-1))/K^{N-1} → 0 as N increases.

So R approaches 1 as N increases, which doesn't match any of the options except perhaps none.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the ratio is approximately (K-1)/K. Let me think: for a full tree, the ratio is (K^{N-1} -1)/(K^N -1) = [K^{N-1}(1 - 1/K^{N-1})]/[K^N (1 - 1/K^N)}] → 1/K as N becomes large.

But the options have (K-1)/K as option C, which is about 0.666 for K=2, but for K=3, it's 0.666 as well. Hmm, but for K=2 and N=2, the ratio is 3/7≈0.428, which is less than (K-1)/K=0.5.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is (K-1)/(K), which is option C.

Wait, but why would that be the case? Let me think of a small example.

Take K=3, N=2.

A complete 3-ary tree of depth 2 would have:

Level 0: 1 node (root).

Level 1: 3 nodes.

Level 2: m nodes, where m can be 1, 2, or 3.

If it's a full tree, m=3.

Total nodes = 1 +3 +3=7.

Nonterminal nodes = 1 +3=4.

Ratio = 4/7 ≈0.571.

Which is close to (3-1)/3=2/3≈0.666, but not exactly.

Hmm, not a perfect match.

Wait, but 4/7 is approximately 0.571, which is closer to 0.5 than to 0.666.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is (K-1)/K for a full tree.

Wait, let me compute (K-1)/K for K=3: 2/3≈0.666, but in the example above, the ratio is 4/7≈0.571, which is less than 0.666.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is (K-1)/K for a complete tree of any depth N.

But in the example above, for K=3, N=2, it's 4/7, which is not equal to (3-1)/3=2/3.

So perhaps that's not the right approach.

Let me think again. The number of nonterminal nodes is sum_{i=0}^{N-2} K^i.

The total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^{N-2} K^i + m, where m is the number of nodes in the last level.

So the ratio R = [sum_{i=0}^{N-2} K^i] / [sum_{i=0}^{N-2} K^i + m].

Now, sum_{i=0}^{N-2} K^i = (K^{N-1} -1)/(K-1).

So R = [ (K^{N-1} -1)/(K-1) ] / [ (K^{N-1} -1)/(K-1) + m ].

Let me factor out (K^{N-1} -1)/(K-1) from numerator and denominator:

R = 1 / [ 1 + m*(K-1)/(K^{N-1} -1) ].

Now, if m is small compared to K^{N-1}, then m*(K-1)/(K^{N-1} -1) ≈ m*(K-1)/K^{N-1}.

But for a complete tree, m can be up to K, so the maximum value of m*(K-1)/K^{N-1} is K*(K-1)/K^{N-1} = (K-1)/K^{N-2}.

As N increases, this term becomes negligible, so R approaches 1. But that can't be correct because the ratio should be significantly less than 1.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering m as part of the last level. Maybe the correct approach is to think that in a complete K-ary tree, the number of nonterminal nodes is (K^{N} -1)/(K-1) - (K-1), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is approximately (K-1)/K, which is option C. Let me think about why.

In a complete K-ary tree, each nonterminal node has exactly K children, except possibly those in the last level. Wait, no, in a complete tree, only the last level may not be full.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of nonterminal to total nodes is (K-1)/K. Let me test for K=2, N=2.

In that case, nonterminal nodes: 3, total nodes:7, ratio=3/7≈0.428. (K-1)/K=1/2=0.5. Close but not exact.

For K=2, N=3.

A perfect tree would have 1+2+4+8=15 nodes. Nonterminal nodes: 1+2+4=7. Ratio=7/15≈0.466. (K-1)/K=0.5, which is close.

But for a complete tree, if the last level has m=1 node, then total nodes=1+2+4+1=8. Nonterminal nodes=1+2+4=7. Ratio=7/8=0.875, which is much higher than 0.5.

Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is (number of nonterminal nodes)/(number of terminal nodes), but the question is about nonterminal to total.

Another approach: perhaps in a complete K-ary tree, the number of nonterminal nodes is (K-1) * (number of levels -1). Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is (K-1)/K, which is option C.

But I'm not fully confident. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A: N/K

B: (N-1)/K

C: (K-1)/K

D: N-1/m

E: log_10 (1/N)

F: 1/N

G: (K-1)/N

H: K/N

I: 1/(K-1)

J: 1/K

From earlier, for a full tree, the ratio approaches 1/K as N increases.

In the example with K=2, N=2, the ratio is 3/7≈0.428, which is close to 1/2=0.5.

But 1/K would be 0.5 for K=2, which is close. For K=3, 1/K≈0.333, but in the earlier example, the ratio was 4/7≈0.571, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the depth. Maybe the depth is N-1, making the last level N.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is (K-1)/K, which is option C, because in a complete tree, the number of nonterminal nodes is (K-1) per level, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is (K-1)/K because each node has K children, and only (K-1) are nonterminal on average. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C: (K-1)/K.

But I'm not fully confident. Another way to think is that in a complete K-ary tree, the number of nonterminal nodes is (K^{N} -1)/(K-1) - m, where m is the number of leaves. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is approximately (K-1)/K because each internal node contributes K children, but perhaps in expectation, the ratio is (K-1)/K.

But I'm not certain. Given the options and the reasoning, I think the best approximation is (K-1)/K, which is option C.
</think>

The question asks for the ratio of nonterminal nodes to total nodes in a complete K-ary tree of depth N. A complete K-ary tree has all levels except the last fully filled, and the last level is filled from left to right. Nonterminal nodes are those that are not leaves, i.e., nodes that have children.

The total number of nodes in a complete K-ary tree can be expressed as the sum of nodes in all levels. For levels 0 to N-2, each level is fully filled, contributing \( K^i \) nodes. The last level (level N-1) has \( m \) nodes, where \( 1 \leq m \leq K \). Thus, the total number of nodes is:

\[
\text{Total nodes} = \sum_{i=0}^{N-2} K^i + m = \frac{K^{N-1} - 1}{K-1} + m
\]

The number of nonterminal nodes is the sum of nodes in levels 0 to N-2, as nodes in the last level are leaves:

\[
\text{Nonterminal nodes} = \sum_{i=0}^{N-2} K^i = \frac{K^{N-1} - 1}{K-1}
\]

The ratio of nonterminal nodes to total nodes is:

\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{\frac{K^{N-1} - 1}{K-1}}{\frac{K^{N-1} - 1}{K-1} + m}
\]

For large \( N \), \( m \) becomes negligible compared to \( \frac{K^{N-1} - 1}{K-1} \), and the ratio approaches:

\[
\text{Ratio} \approx \frac{\frac{K^{N-1} - 1}{K-1}}{\frac{K^{N-1} - 1}{K-1}} = 1
\]

However, this contradicts the options provided, suggesting the ratio should be less than 1. Reconsidering the structure, for a complete K-ary tree, the ratio of nonterminal nodes to total nodes is best approximated as \( \frac{K-1}{K} \), which aligns with option C.
