Okay, so I've got this quadratic equation to solve: 6x² -7x -20 = 0. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my algebra, but I think I can figure this out. Let me try to remember the steps.

First, I know that a quadratic equation is usually in the form ax² + bx + c = 0, and the solutions can be found using the quadratic formula. The formula is x = (-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)) / (2a). Right, so I need to identify a, b, and c from the equation.

Looking at 6x² -7x -20 = 0, a is 6, b is -7, and c is -20. Wait, let me make sure I got that right. The equation is 6x squared minus 7x minus 20, so yeah, a=6, b=-7, c=-20.

Now, plugging these into the quadratic formula. Let's compute the discriminant first, which is b² - 4ac. So, b squared is (-7)², which is 49. Then, 4ac is 4 * 6 * (-20). Let me calculate that: 4 *6 is 24, and 24 * (-20) is -480. So the discriminant is 49 - (-480). Wait, subtracting a negative is like adding, so 49 + 480 = 529. Oh, that's a perfect square because 23² is 529. That's good because it means the roots will be rational.

So now, the square root of 529 is 23. So plugging back into the formula: x = [7 ± 23] / (2 * 6). Wait a second, because b is -7, so -b is 7. So the two solutions are (7 + 23)/(12) and (7 -23)/(12).

Calculating the first one: 7 +23 is 30, so 30/12 simplifies to 5/2. The second one: 7 -23 is -16, so -16/12. Let me simplify that: both numerator and denominator are divisible by 4. So -16 ÷4 is -4, 12 ÷4 is 3, so it becomes -4/3.

So the two solutions are x = 5/2 and x = -4/3. Now I need to check the options given. Let me look at the options from A to J.

Option A: 5/2, 4/3. Wait, the second solution I got is -4/3, not positive. So A isn't correct.

Option B: -5/3, 4/2. 4/2 is 2, but I don't think 2 is a solution. Let me check: plugging x=2 into 6x²-7x-20: 6*(4) is 24, minus 14, minus20. 24-14=10, 10-20=-10, which isn't zero. So B is wrong.

Option C: 5/3, -4/2. 5/3 is not 5/2, so no. Also, -4/2 is -2, which isn't a solution either.

Option D: 2, -10. I already checked x=2, which didn't work. So D is out.

Option E: 4, -5. Plugging x=4: 6*(16)=96, 96 -28=68, 68-20=48, not zero. So E is wrong.

Option F: -5/2, 4/3. Neither of these match my solutions. I have 5/2 and -4/3.

Option G: -5/6, 4/5. No, these aren't the same as what I found.

Option H: 5/2, -4/3. Oh, that's exactly what I got! So H must be the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check. 5/2 is 2.5, and -4/3 is about -1.333. Let me plug x=5/2 into the equation:

6*(5/2)^2 = 6*(25/4) = 150/4 = 37.5
-7*(5/2) = -35/2 = -17.5
-20 remains.

So 37.5 -17.5 = 20, 20 -20=0. Perfect.

Now x=-4/3:

6*(-4/3)^2 = 6*(16/9) = 96/9 ≈10.666...
-7*(-4/3)=28/3≈9.333...
-20 is -20.

So 10.666... +9.333... =20, 20-20=0. So yes, correct.

Looking back at the options, H is 5/2, -4/3, which matches exactly. So the correct answer should be H.

The solutions to the quadratic equation 6x² -7x -20 = 0 are found using the quadratic formula. After calculating, the roots are 5/2 and -4/3, which match option H.

Answer: H
