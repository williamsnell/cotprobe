Okay, so I have this calculus problem here about finding the volume of a solid formed by rotating the region bounded by y = x and y = x² in the first quadrant around the y-axis. Hmm, right. I remember that when you rotate a region around an axis, you can use methods like the disk method or the shell method to find the volume. Let me think about which one would be more appropriate here.

First, let me visualize the curves. y = x is a straight line passing through the origin with a slope of 1, and y = x² is a parabola opening upwards also passing through the origin. In the first quadrant, these two curves intersect at (0,0) and another point. To find the other point of intersection, I can set x = x², which gives x² - x = 0 → x(x - 1) = 0. So, x = 0 or x = 1. Therefore, the region is bounded between x=0 and x=1.

Since we're rotating around the y-axis, I think the shell method might be easier because it's integrating with respect to x, and the radius of each shell would be x, and the height would be the difference between the two functions. Alternatively, the disk method could be used if I solve for x in terms of y, which would require integrating with respect to y. Let me consider both approaches.

Starting with the shell method: The formula for the volume when using shells is V = 2π ∫ (radius)(height) dx from a to b. Here, the radius is x, and the height is the top function minus the bottom function. Between x=0 and x=1, the top function is y = x and the bottom is y = x². So the height is x - x². Therefore, the integral becomes V = 2π ∫ from 0 to 1 of x*(x - x²) dx.

Let me compute that. First, expand the integrand: x*(x - x²) = x² - x³. Now, integrate term by term. The integral of x² is (1/3)x³, and the integral of x³ is (1/4)x⁴. So putting it together:

V = 2π [ (1/3)x³ - (1/4)x⁴ ] evaluated from 0 to 1.

Plugging in 1: (1/3)(1) - (1/4)(1) = 1/3 - 1/4 = (4/12 - 3/12) = 1/12.

Plugging in 0 gives 0. So V = 2π*(1/12) = π/6.

Wait, but that's one of the options. Option J is π/6. Hmm. Let me check if I did everything correctly.

Alternatively, maybe I should try the disk method to cross-verify. So for the disk method, since we're rotating around the y-axis, we'll integrate with respect to y. The radius of each disk would be x as a function of y, so we need to express x in terms of y for both curves.

From y = x, we get x = y. From y = x², we get x = sqrt(y). So, for each y between 0 and 1, the outer radius is sqrt(y) and the inner radius is y. So the area of the washer is π*( (sqrt(y))² - y² ) = π*(y - y²). Then, the volume is the integral from y=0 to y=1 of π*(y - y²) dy.

Wait a minute, that doesn't seem right. Because if we're using the disk method, the outer radius is the further function from the y-axis, which is sqrt(y), and the inner radius is the closer function, which is y. So the area should be π*( (sqrt(y))² - (y)^2 ) = π*(y - y²). So the integral becomes π ∫ from 0 to1 (y - y²) dy.

Let me compute that. The integral of y is (1/2)y², and the integral of y² is (1/3)y³. So:

V = π [ (1/2)y² - (1/3)y³ ] from 0 to1.

At y=1: (1/2)(1) - (1/3)(1) = 1/2 - 1/3 = (3/6 - 2/6) = 1/6.

At y=0, it's 0. So V = π*(1/6) = π/6. Hmm, same result as with the shell method. That's reassuring.

Wait, but in the shell method, I got π/6, and in the disk method, also π/6. So the volume should be π/6, which is option J.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be different. Let me double-check the setup.

In the shell method, the formula is V = 2π ∫ (radius)(height) dx. Radius is x, height is (top - bottom) which is x - x², correct. So integrating x*(x - x²) from 0 to 1.

Yes, that gives (x² - x³), integral from 0 to1 is (1/3 - 1/4) = 1/12. Multiply by 2π: 2π*(1/12) = π/6.

In the disk method, the outer radius is sqrt(y), inner radius is y. So area is π*(y - y²). Integrate from 0 to1: π*(1/2 - 1/3) = π*(1/6) = π/6.

Wait a second, both methods give the same result. So the correct answer should be π/6, which is option J.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the shell and disk methods. Sometimes, especially with horizontal versus vertical slices, it's easy to make a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is to use the formula for the volume of revolution. Let me think about the shape. It's the area between y = x and y = x² from x=0 to x=1, rotated about the y-axis. So using either shell or disk method, both correctly applied, yield the same result, π/6. So I think that's the correct answer.

Another way to check is to see what the options are. The options include π/6 as option J, so that must be the correct choice.

The region bounded by y = x and y = x² in the first quadrant is rotated about the y-axis. To find the volume of the resulting solid, both the shell method and the disk method are applied.

Using the shell method:
- The radius of each shell is x, and the height is (x - x²).
- The volume integral is V = 2π ∫₀¹ x(x - x²) dx = 2π ∫₀¹ (x² - x³) dx.
- Evaluating the integral gives V = 2π [ (1/3)x³ - (1/4)x⁴ ] from 0 to 1 = 2π*(1/12) = π/6.

Using the disk method:
- The outer radius is sqrt(y) and the inner radius is y.
- The volume integral is V = π ∫₀¹ (y - y²) dy.
- Evaluating the integral gives V = π [ (1/2)y² - (1/3)y³ ] from 0 to 1 = π*(1/6) = π/6.

Both methods yield the same result, π/6.
