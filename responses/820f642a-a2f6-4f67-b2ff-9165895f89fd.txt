Question:

A well-established paper mill and a logging company signed a written contract in which the mill agreed to buy from the company all the logs the mill would need for one year. The company was unable to keep up with the mill's needs, and its log deliveries fell short by 10% to 15% in each of the four quarters of the year. The mill paid the company on time for all delivered logs. The mill paid an attorney $2,000 for advice concerning its options in enforcing the contract. It paid a broker a reasonable fee of $5,000 to find additional logs to make up for the company's shortfall. The mill also incurred reasonable costs of $25,000 to transport the additional logs to its facility. Despite the mill's efforts to mitigate damages, it sustained $200,000 in losses because of the company's failure to timely deliver enough logs. The mill has sued the company for breach of contract. If the court finds for the mill, how much should it award in damages?

Options:

A: $205,000.00
B: $220,000.00
C: $225,000.00
D: $240,000.00
E: $200,000.00
F: $230,000.00
G: $232,000.00
H: $250,000.00
I: $235,000.00
J: $210,000.00

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how much the mill should be awarded in damages after the logging company breached their contract. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the mill and the logging company had a written contract where the company agreed to supply all the logs the mill needed for a year. But the company didn't deliver enough logs each quarterâ€”about 10% to 15% short each time. The mill had to find alternative sources, which cost them money, and they also had to transport those extra logs, which added more costs.

The mill paid the attorney $2,000 for advice. I think that's related to the costs of enforcing the contract. They also paid a broker $5,000 to find additional logs. Then, they spent $25,000 on transporting those logs. And despite all that, they still lost $200,000 because of the shortfall in logs.

So the question is about the damages the mill should receive if the court finds in their favor. I remember that in contract law, when one party breaches, the other is usually entitled to compensatory damages, which aim to put them in the position they'd have been in had the contract been fulfilled.

But wait, there's also the issue of mitigation. The mill took steps to mitigate their losses by finding a broker and transporting the logs. So they can't just claim the total $200,000 loss without considering what they did to reduce that loss.

Looking at the numbers: The direct loss is $200,000. But then there are the costs they incurred to mitigate. The broker fee is $5,000, and the transportation is $25,000. Plus, the $2,000 attorney fee. So adding those up: 2,000 + 5,000 + 25,000 = $32,000.

Wait, but in contract law, mitigation costs are allowed because the non-breaching party has a duty to mitigate. So the costs they incurred to mitigate are part of the damages because they're reasonable expenses to cover the shortfall.

So the total damages would be the loss ($200k) plus the mitigation costs ($32k). That sums up to $232,000.

Wait, but let me make sure. Sometimes, the costs of mitigation might not be recoverable if they're considered avoidable or if they're part of the loss. But in this case, the mill had to pay the broker and the transportation, which are necessary to mitigate their loss, so those should be included.

Looking at the options, option G is $232,000, which would be $200k + $32k. So I think that's the right answer.

The mill is entitled to recover damages that include their direct loss and the costs incurred to mitigate that loss. The direct loss is $200,000, and the mitigation costs include the attorney fee ($2,000), broker fee ($5,000), and transportation costs ($25,000), totaling $32,000. Adding these together results in $232,000 in damages.

Answer: G
