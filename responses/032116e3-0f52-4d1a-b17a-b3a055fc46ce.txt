Question:

For point-to-point communication at higher frequencies, the desiredradiation pattern is a single narrow lobe or beam. To obtainsuch a characteristic (at least approximately) a multi-elementlinear array is usually used. An array is linear whenthe elements of the ar-ray are spaced equally along a straightline. In a uniform linear array the elements are fed withcurrents of equal magnitude and having a uniform progressivephase shift along the line. The pattern of such anarray can be obtained by addingvectoriallythe field strengthsdue to each of the elements. For a uniform array of non-directionalelements the field strength would be E_T = E_0 \vert1 +e^J\psi+ e^J2\psi + e^J3\psi + ... +e^j^(^n-1)\psi \vert(1) where \psi =\betadcos\textphi + \alpha and\alpha is the progressive phase shift between elements, (\alpha is theangle by which the current in any element leads the currentin the preceding element.) Compute the pattern of such a linear array.

Options:

A: 0.512
B: 0.612
C: 0.212
D: 0.212 (with a different phase shift)
E: 0.412
F: 0.312
G: 0.112
H: 0.712
I: 0.912
J: 0.112 (with a different element spacing)

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about the radiation pattern of a uniform linear array. Hmm, the question gives me an equation for E_T, which is the total electric field strength. The formula is E_T = E_0 |1 + e^{jψ} + e^{j2ψ} + ... + e^{j(n-1)ψ}|. And ψ is given as βd cosφ + α, where α is the phase shift between elements.

Wait, I remember that when elements are spaced with a certain phase shift, the radiation pattern can be a summation of phasors. For a uniform linear array, this should form a certain shape, maybe like a sinc function or something similar.

So the expression inside the absolute value is a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series with ratio e^{jψ} and n terms. The sum S is (1 - e^{j n ψ}) / (1 - e^{j ψ}), right? But when we take the magnitude squared, it becomes |S|^2.

Wait, but the question is asking for the pattern, which is the magnitude of the sum. So I think I need to compute the magnitude of this sum. Let me write it out.

The sum is S = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} e^{j k ψ} = (1 - e^{j n ψ}) / (1 - e^{j ψ}).

Taking the magnitude squared of S: |S|^2 = |(1 - e^{j n ψ})|^2 / |1 - e^{j ψ}|^2.

Expanding numerator and denominator. Let's compute both.

The numerator: |1 - e^{j n ψ}|^2 = (1 - cos(nψ))^2 + (sin(nψ))^2. Wait, actually, the magnitude squared of (1 - e^{jθ}) is |1 - e^{jθ}|² = (1 - cosθ)^2 + (sinθ)^2 = 2(1 - cosθ) = 4 sin²(θ/2).

So numerator becomes 4 sin²(nψ/2), denominator is 4 sin²(ψ/2). So |S|^2 = [4 sin²(nψ/2)] / [4 sin²(ψ/2)] = [sin(nψ/2) / sin(ψ/2)]².

Wait, but the problem just asks for the pattern, which is E_T. The magnitude is |S|, so |S| = |sin(nψ/2) / sin(ψ/2)|.

But the options given are numbers like 0.512, 0.612, etc. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the pattern is a function of φ, not a single number. Maybe the question is asking for the maximum value of the pattern or perhaps the pattern at a specific angle?

Wait, looking back at the question: It says "compute the pattern of such a linear array." But the options are all single numerical values. That's confusing. Maybe it's asking for the expression, but the options are numbers. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the maximum value or the main lobe's peak.

Wait, another approach: For a uniform linear array with n elements, the maximum value of the pattern occurs when the denominator sin(ψ/2) is smallest, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the peak is when all the phasors add up constructively, which happens when ψ = 0, but then sin(0) is zero, which is problematic. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, ψ is βd cosφ + α. In the case where the array is set for maximum radiation (usually α is chosen such that the phase shift leads to constructive interference at the desired angle). For a uniform array, the maximum gain is when the array is aligned along the direction of φ=0, maybe?

Wait, perhaps the maximum value of E_T occurs when ψ = 0. But if ψ = 0, then each term in the sum is 1, so the sum is n, and |S|=n. But that would make E_T = E_0 * n, which is the maximum possible. However, the options don't have anything that suggests n, unless n is given, but the problem doesn't specify n.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's asking for the expression of the pattern, but the options are all specific numbers. That doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the normalized pattern, but without knowing n or ψ, I can't compute a specific numerical value.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The formula given is E_T = E_0 |sum_{k=0}^{n-1} e^{j k ψ}|. The sum is a geometric series. The magnitude is |sum| = |sin(nψ/2) / sin(ψ/2)|. So the pattern is proportional to this, which is a well-known formula for linear arrays.

But the options are all numbers like 0.512, etc., which suggests that perhaps the question is asking for the maximum value of the pattern divided by something. Wait, the maximum value of |sum| is n, when ψ is a multiple of 2π, but that would make each term 1, so sum is n. But again, without knowing n, I can't compute the exact value.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the value of the pattern at a specific angle φ, but the problem doesn't specify. So maybe the question is incomplete or I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: The formula given is E_T = E_0 |1 + e^{jψ} + ... + e^{j(n-1)ψ}|. So the magnitude is |sum|. Perhaps the options are about the maximum value of E_T, but without knowing n, I can't compute it. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick, and the pattern is given by this formula, and the options are just distractors.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually about the approximate pattern when the array is large (n is large), which would approximate a sinc function. But the options are specific numbers, so I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the options are about the value of the pattern at a certain angle where the maximum occurs, but without more information, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the beamwidth or the first null, but again, the options are just numbers without units, so I'm confused.

Wait, maybe I should look at the options again. All the options are in the range 0.112 to 0.912. Perhaps the question is about the normalized pattern, and the options are the maximum gain divided by something. For example, the maximum gain is n, so maybe the normalized pattern is (sin(nψ/2)/sin(ψ/2))², but even then, without knowing n or ψ, I can't compute a number.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider that the correct answer is option I: 0.912, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, perhaps the correct pattern is given by the formula, and the options are trying to represent the maximum value, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the question is a standard one, and the pattern for a uniform linear array is (sin(nψ/2)/sin(ψ/2))², which is the square of the magnitude. But the options don't match that formula.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the main lobe's maximum, which would be n². But again, the options don't have anything like that.

Wait, perhaps the phase shift α is set to a specific value, like α = 0, which would make the array's elements in phase. Then ψ = βd cosφ. But without knowing β, d, or φ, I can't compute a numerical value.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe the correct approach is to realize that the pattern is given by the formula and that the options are just distractors. So perhaps the answer is I: 0.912, but I'm not sure why.

The problem involves computing the radiation pattern of a uniform linear array, which is given by the formula \( E_T = E_0 \left| 1 + e^{j\psi} + e^{j2\psi} + \dots + e^{j(n-1)\psi} \right| \), where \( \psi = \beta d \cos\phi + \alpha \). The sum of this geometric series can be expressed as \( \left| \frac{\sin(n\psi/2)}{\sin(\psi/2)} \right| \), representing the magnitude of the field strength. However, the question asks for a numerical value from the provided options, which are single numbers. Since the options do not align with the derived formula or provide sufficient context to compute a specific numerical value, the most plausible choice based on the given options is:

I: 0.912
