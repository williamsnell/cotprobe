Okay, so I've got this Boolean logic question here, and I'm trying to figure out which conditions can be expressed using only AND and OR connectives, without using NOT. The variables are p1, p2, p3, p4. The options are I, II, III, and I have to pick which ones are possible.

Let me break down each condition one by one.

Condition I says: At least three of p1 to p4 are true. So that means either exactly three are true, or all four are true. How can I express that without using NOT? Well, for "at least three," I can think of it as the OR of all possible cases where three or four are true. But wait, I can't use NOT, so I can't just say "if exactly three, then true; else, if four, then true." Hmm, but can I express this with ANDs and ORs?

Wait, maybe another approach. The condition is true when the sum of p1+p2+p3+p4 is >=3. But how do I express that as a Boolean formula? Well, each term is p_i, which is either true or false. So the formula would be the OR of all combinations where at least three are true. But that's a lot of terms. Like, for exactly three true, there are four terms: (p1∧p2∧p3)∨(p1∧p2∧p4)∨(p1∧p3∧p4)∨(p2∧p3∧p4). And then add the case where all four are true, which is p1∧p2∧p3∧p4. So overall, it's the OR of all these. So yes, I can express condition I with AND and OR. So I is possible.

Condition II: Exactly three are true. That's a bit trickier because it's more specific. How do I ensure that exactly three are true without using NOT? Well, if I have any four-variable Boolean formula that's true only when exactly three are 1. Hmm, can I construct such a formula with just AND and OR?

Wait, another approach: For exactly three variables to be true, each of the four variables must be excluded once. Like, for p1 to be excluded, the formula would be (p2∧p3∧p4). Similarly, for p2 to be excluded, it's (p1∧p3∧p4), and so on. Then, the condition is the OR of all these four possibilities. So the formula is (p2∧p3∧p4) ∨ (p1∧p3∧p4) ∨ (p1∧p2∧p4) ∨ (p1∧p2∧p3). So yes, that's possible with just AND and OR. So condition II is also expressible.

Condition III: An even number are true. Hmm, this is interesting. So the number of true variables is 0, 2, or 4. How can I express that without NOT? Let me think about how to represent even parity in Boolean expressions. One way is to use the XOR of all variables, but that's not directly helpful here. Alternatively, I can think about the product of the sum of pairs.

Wait, another approach: The condition is true when the sum of p1+p2+p3+p4 is even. So, the parity is even. I remember that in Boolean algebra, the even parity function can be expressed as the negation of the XOR of all variables. But wait, I can't use NOT, so I have to find another way.

Alternatively, each pair contributes to the even count. Maybe using the product terms. Wait, perhaps using the formula that is the OR of all possible even combinations. But that's a lot of terms. Alternatively, maybe using the sum of the products of all even-sized subsets.

Wait, another thought: The even parity can be expressed as the negation of the XOR (which is the same as the parity function). But since I can't use NOT, I have to find a way without it. Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe using the formula that is the product of the sum of each pair of variables. Wait, no, that doesn't directly give even parity.

Wait, let me think differently. Let me represent the even parity as follows: The number of true variables is even. So, when the count is even, the formula is true. How can I express this?

I recall that in Boolean algebra, the even parity function can be written as the product of the sum of each pair. For example, (p1 XOR p2) XOR (p3 XOR p4) would give the overall parity. But again, XOR is a connective that I can't use if I'm limited to AND and OR. Alternatively, I can express XOR using AND, OR, and NOT, but since I can't use NOT, that complicates things.

Wait, maybe using the formula that is the product of the sum of each pair. Wait, no, that's not the same as even parity. Let me think: The even parity function is true when an even number of variables are true. So, for four variables, it's when the sum is 0, 2, or 4.

So, the formula would be the OR of all the possible combinations where 0, 2, or 4 variables are true. But that's a lot of terms. Alternatively, is there a smarter way to express this without writing all the combinations?

Wait, another approach: The even parity can be represented as the product of (1 + p1)(1 + p2)(1 + p3)(1 + p4) evaluated at the sum. Wait, no, that's not directly helpful.

Wait, perhaps using the formula that is the negation of the sum of all variables, but that's not correct. Wait, no, because sum being even is different.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the fact that the even parity function can be expressed as the product of the sum of each pair. Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle.

Wait, maybe I can express the even parity as follows: It's equivalent to the formula being true when the number of true variables is even. So, considering all possible pairs, maybe the formula can be built as the OR of all pairs where exactly two are true, plus the case where all four are true and the case where none are true.

But that's again a lot of terms. Wait, but can I express it without using NOT? Let me think: For even parity, it's when the sum is even. So, for four variables, the sum mod 2 is 0. But how to represent that mod 2 without using NOT.

Wait, perhaps using the formula that is the product of (p1 XOR p2) and (p3 XOR p4), but again, XOR is not allowed.

Wait, maybe I can represent the even parity as a combination of AND and OR without NOT. Let me think of the formula as follows:

The even parity is true when the number of true variables is even. So, for four variables, that's when 0, 2, or 4 are true. So, the formula would be:

(p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ∧ p4) ∨ (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ ¬p3 ∧ ¬p4) ∨ ... etc. Wait, but I can't use ¬, so this approach won't work.

Wait, another thought: The even parity can be expressed using the inclusion of all possible pairs. For example, for each pair, if they're both true or both false, that contributes to even parity. But I'm not sure how to combine that into a formula without using NOT.

Alternatively, maybe using the formula that is the product of (p_i ∨ p_j) for all i < j. No, that doesn't directly give even parity.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think: The even parity is the same as the negation of the XOR of all variables. But since I can't use NOT, I can't directly invert it. So, is there a way to express the negation of the XOR using only AND and OR?

Wait, the XOR of four variables is equivalent to the sum mod 2. So, the even parity is the negation of that sum. But without using NOT, I can't negate it. So, perhaps it's impossible to express the even parity function with only AND and OR?

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because I know that any Boolean function can be expressed in terms of AND and OR, but maybe not in a straightforward way. Or perhaps there's a way using the inclusion-exclusion principle.

Wait, another approach: The even parity function can be expressed as the product of (p1 ∨ p2) ∧ (p3 ∨ p4), but that's not correct because that would represent the case where at least two variables in each pair are true, which isn't the same as even parity.

Wait, maybe I'm stuck. Let me think again. For condition III, can I express an even number of variables being true using only AND and OR? Let's see.

Suppose I want to express that an even number of p1 to p4 are true. So, the formula should be true when 0, 2, or 4 variables are true.

One way to express this is to take the OR of all combinations where exactly 0, 2, or 4 variables are true. But that would involve a lot of terms, but technically, it's possible with AND and OR. So, for example, the formula would be:

(p1 ∧ ¬p2 ∧ ¬p3 ∧ ¬p4) ∨ (¬p1 ∧ p2 ∧ ¬p3 ∧ ¬p4) ∨ ... 

But wait, I can't use ¬, so this approach is invalid.

So, without using NOT, can I express the even parity?

Wait, another idea: The even parity function can be represented as the product of the sum of each pair being even. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula that is the product of (p1 ∨ p2) ∧ (p3 ∨ p4), but that doesn't capture the even count correctly.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think of it differently. For the even parity, the formula must be true when an even number of variables are true. So, let's consider that when the number is even, the product of (1 + p_i) would be 1. But I'm not sure how that helps without using arithmetic.

Wait, perhaps I can express the even parity as the OR of all possible even-sized combinations. But again, without using NOT, I can't exclude the cases where the number is odd.

Wait, perhaps it's impossible to express the even parity function using only AND and OR connectives. Because to exclude the cases where the number is odd, I would need to use NOT, which I don't have.

So, maybe condition III cannot be expressed with just AND and OR.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. Maybe there's a way to construct the formula without using NOT. For example, using the fact that even parity can be expressed as the product of certain terms.

Alternatively, perhaps condition III can be expressed as the formula:

(p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ∧ p4) ∨ (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ∧ p4) [Wait, that's just the same as p1∧p2∧p3∧p4, which is only the case where all four are true.]

No, that's not right. I need to include all cases where the count is even.

Wait, perhaps using the formula that is the OR of all possible pairs of two variables being true, plus the case where all four are true, plus the case where none are true. But without using NOT, how can I include the case where none are true? Because that's when all variables are false, which is the same as ¬p1 ∧ ¬p2 ∧ ¬p3 ∧ ¬p4. But I can't use ¬, so I can't express that.

Therefore, I can't express the case where none are true without using NOT, so condition III can't be expressed with just AND and OR. Wait, but that's contradictory because I know that any Boolean function can be expressed in terms of AND and OR, although perhaps not in a straightforward way.

Wait, no, any Boolean function can be expressed using only AND and OR by using the sum-of-products form. So, for condition III, the even parity, the sum-of-products form would include all the minterms where an even number of variables are true. So, for four variables, that's the minterms where 0, 2, or 4 variables are true.

So, the formula would be:

(p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ∧ p4) ∨ (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ ¬p3 ∧ ¬p4) ∨ ... etc.

But again, I can't use ¬, so that's a problem. Wait, but the question says we can't use ¬, so we can't write those terms. Therefore, I can't express the even parity without using NOT, which is forbidden here.

Wait, but that can't be right because sum-of-products is possible without NOT if we're allowed to use the variables as they are. Wait, no, because in sum-of-products, each term is a conjunction of variables, possibly negated. But if we can't use negation, then we can't represent the terms where variables are false.

So, for example, the minterm where p1 and p2 are true and p3 and p4 are false would be p1 ∧ p2 ∧ ¬p3 ∧ ¬p4, but since we can't use ¬, we can't write that term. Therefore, we can't include that in our formula, which means we can't express the even parity function without using NOT.

Therefore, condition III cannot be expressed using only AND and OR connectives. So, only conditions I and II can be expressed.

Wait, but earlier I thought that condition II can be expressed. Let me double-check.

Condition II: Exactly three are true. As I thought earlier, that can be expressed as the OR of all possible terms where exactly three variables are true. So, for four variables, that's four terms: (p2 ∧ p3 ∧ p4) ∨ (p1 ∧ p3 ∧ p4) ∨ (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p4) ∨ (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3). So, yes, that's possible with AND and OR.

So, conditions I and II can be expressed, but condition III cannot. Therefore, looking back at the options, the correct answer would be J: Only I and II.

Wait, but let me make sure. The options are:

A: None

B: All

C: I and III

D: Only II and III

E: III only

F: Only I and II

G: I only

H: II and III

I: II only

J: I and II

So, according to my reasoning, I can express I and II, but not III. So the answer should be J.

The question asks which conditions can be expressed using Boolean formulas with only AND (∧) and OR (∨) connectives, without using NOT (¬). The variables are p₁, p₂, p₃, p₄, and the conditions are:

I. At least three of p₁, p₂, p₃, p₄ are true.  
II. Exactly three of p₁, p₂, p₃, p₄ are true.  
III. An even number of p₁, p₂, p₃, p₄ are true.

### Analysis:

1. **Condition I (At least three are true):**  
   This condition can be expressed as the OR of all combinations where three or four variables are true. For example:
   \[
   (p₁ ∧ p₂ ∧ p₃) ∨ (p₁ ∧ p₂ ∧ p₄) ∨ (p₁ ∧ p₃ ∧ p₄) ∨ (p₂ ∧ p₃ ∧ p₄) ∨ (p₁ ∧ p₂ ∧ p₃ ∧ p₄)
   \]
   This formula uses only AND and OR, so **Condition I is expressible**.

2. **Condition II (Exactly three are true):**  
   This condition can be expressed as the OR of all combinations where exactly three variables are true. For example:
   \[
   (p₂ ∧ p₃ ∧ p₄) ∨ (p₁ ∧ p₃ ∧ p₄) ∨ (p₁ ∧ p₂ ∧ p₄) ∨ (p₁ ∧ p₂ ∧ p₃)
   \]
   This formula also uses only AND and OR, so **Condition II is expressible**.

3. **Condition III (An even number are true):**  
   This condition requires the number of true variables to be 0, 2, or 4. However, expressing this without NOT is challenging. The sum-of-products approach would require terms like ¬p₁ ∧ ¬p₂ ∧ ¬p₃ ∧ ¬p₄ (for 0 true variables), which cannot be written without NOT. Similarly, terms for exactly two or four true variables would also require negations. Since NOT is not allowed, **Condition III cannot be expressed**.

### Conclusion:
Conditions I and II can be expressed using only AND and OR, but Condition III cannot. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: J**
