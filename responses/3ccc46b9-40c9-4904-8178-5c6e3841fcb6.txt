Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the convolution of two functions, f₁(t) and f₂(t). Both functions are multiplied by the unit step function u(t), which means they're zero before t=0. Let me write down what I know.

f₁(t) is given as 2e^(-4t)u(t). That's straightforward; it's an exponential decay starting at t=0. f₂(t) is 5 cos(3t)u(t), so it's a cosine function also starting at t=0.

Convolution of two signals f₁ and f₂ is defined as the integral from negative infinity to positive infinity of f₁(τ) * f₂(t - τ) dτ. But since both functions are multiplied by u(τ) and u(t - τ), the integral simplifies to the integral from 0 to t of f₁(τ)f₂(t - τ) dτ.

Let me write that out:

f₁(t) * f₂(t) = ∫₀^t [2e^(-4τ)] [5 cos(3(t - τ))] dτ.

Simplify the constants: 2 * 5 = 10. So the integral becomes 10 ∫₀^t e^(-4τ) cos(3(t - τ)) dτ.

Hmm, substituting x = t - τ, which means when τ=0, x=t, and when τ=t, x=0. So the limits become from x=0 to x=t, and dτ = -dx. Wait, but since the limits are reversing, I can just swap them and remove the negative sign, so τ becomes t - x, and the integral becomes ∫₀^t e^(-4(t - x)) cos(3x) dx.

Wait, let me double-check that substitution. Let me set x = t - τ. Then τ = t - x, and dτ = -dx. So when τ=0, x=t; when τ=t, x=0. So the integral becomes ∫ from x=t to x=0 of e^(-4(t - x)) cos(3x) (-dx). The negative flips the limits, so it becomes ∫ from 0 to t of e^(-4(t - x)) cos(3x) dx.

Yes, that's correct. So expanding that, e^(-4(t - x)) is e^(-4t) * e^(4x). So the integral becomes e^(-4t) ∫₀^t e^(4x) cos(3x) dx.

So now I have 10 e^(-4t) times the integral of e^(4x) cos(3x) dx from 0 to t. Let me focus on solving that integral.

I remember that the integral of e^(ax) cos(bx) dx can be found using integration by parts or using a standard formula. The formula is:

∫ e^(ax) cos(bx) dx = [e^(ax) (a cos(bx) + b sin(bx))]/(a² + b²) ) + C.

In this case, a = 4 and b = 3. So applying the formula:

∫ e^(4x) cos(3x) dx = [e^(4x) (4 cos(3x) + 3 sin(3x))]/(4² + 3²) ) + C
= [e^(4x) (4 cos3x + 3 sin3x)] / 25 + C.

So evaluating from 0 to t:

At t: [e^(4t) (4 cos3t + 3 sin3t)] /25
At 0: [e^(0) (4 cos0 + 3 sin0)] /25 = [1*(4*1 + 0)] /25 = 4/25.

So the integral from 0 to t is [e^(4t)(4 cos3t +3 sin3t) -4]/25.

Putting it all back into the expression:

f₁ * f₂ = 10 e^(-4t) * [ (e^(4t)(4 cos3t +3 sin3t) -4 ) /25 ]

Simplify this:

The e^(-4t) and e^(4t) cancel out, leaving 10/25 * (4 cos3t +3 sin3t -4).

10/25 simplifies to 2/5, which is 0.4.

So that would be 0.4*(4 cos3t +3 sin3t -4) = [0.4*4 cos3t + 0.4*3 sin3t -0.4*4] = (1.6 cos3t + 1.2 sin3t -1.6) all multiplied by u(t).

Wait, but looking at the options, all the answer options have terms like (something cos 3t + something sin3t - something e^{-4t}) u(t). But in my result, the last term is -1.6, not involving e^{-4t}.

Hmm, did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me check.

Wait, no, because when I substituted everything, I had 10 e^(-4t) multiplied by [ (e^(4t)(4 cos3t +3 sin3t) -4 ) /25 ]

Which becomes 10/25 [ (4 cos3t +3 sin3t) -4 e^{-4t} ].

Wait, because when you expand, e^(-4t) * e^(4t) is 1, so first term is (4 cos3t +3 sin3t) * e^0 = same as the term. The second term is e^(-4t)*(-4) from the integral's lower limit, but wait no, the integral's result is [e^(4t)(4 cos3t +3 sin3t) -4 ] /25.

Wait, no, when I applied the limits, it's [e^(4t)(4 cos3t +3 sin3t) - 4 ] at x= t and x=0, right? So the integral is [e^(4t)(4 cos3t +3 sin3t) -4 ] /25.

So when I multiply by 10 e^(-4t), it's 10 e^(-4t) * [e^(4t)(4 cos3t +3 sin3t) -4 ] /25.

Breaking that down:

10 e^(-4t) * e^(4t) (4 cos3t +3 sin3t) = 10*(4 cos3t +3 sin3t)
10 e^(-4t) * (-4) = -40 e^(-4t)

So dividing by 25: [10*(4 cos3t +3 sin3t) -40 e^{-4t} ] /25.

Which is (40 cos3t +30 sin3t -40 e^{-4t}) /25.

Simplify each term: 40/25 = 1.6, 30/25=1.2, 40/25=1.6.

So it becomes [1.6 cos3t + 1.2 sin3t -1.6 e^{-4t}] u(t).

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is exactly that: (1.6 cos3t + 1.2 sin3t -1.6 e^{-4t}) u(t).

So the answer should be option A.
