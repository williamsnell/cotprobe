Okay, so I need to figure out what the monetary or demand deposit multiplier is and how it's calculated. I remember from my economics class that it has something to do with how banks create money. Let me think.

Hmm, the term "monetary multiplier" sounds like it's about how money is multiplied through the banking system. I think it's related to fractional reserve banking. Banks don't keep all deposits as reserves; they lend out a portion, which in turn gets deposited again, and so on. This process creates more money in the economy.

So, the multiplier effect is how much the money supply increases based on the reserves. The formula I remember is something like 1 divided by the reserve ratio. But wait, the question is about the term and its calculation, not the formula.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Ratio of money supply to central bank's monetary base. That sounds like the money multiplier, which is money supply divided by base money. But the question is about the monetary or demand deposit multiplier. So maybe A is not the right one.

Option B: Increase in currency from a single deposit. That sounds more like the concept of deposit expansion, where a deposit leads to more loans and more deposits. But I'm not sure if that's the multiplier itself or just part of it.

Option C: Ratio of demand deposits to total reserves. Wait, demand deposits are like checking accounts, and reserves are the funds banks hold. So if you take deposits and divide by reserves, that might be the multiplier. Because when banks have reserves, they can create more deposits through loans. So maybe C is correct.

Option D: Ratio of reserves to loans. That would be the inverse of the leverage, perhaps. Not sure how that relates to the multiplier.

Option E: Demand deposits to loans. Doesn't seem right; the multiplier isn't about comparing deposits to loans directly.

Option F: Loans to reserves. That sounds like the money multiplier, perhaps, but I think the multiplier is more about deposits.

Option G: Reserves to demand deposits. That's the inverse of what I thought earlier. Maybe that's the reserve ratio, not the multiplier.

Option H: Rate at which new money is created per dollar of reserves. That sounds like the money multiplier itself, which is the factor by which money expands based on reserves. So H could be correct. Wait, the monetary multiplier is the rate at which new money is created for each dollar of reserves. That makes sense.

Option I: Government bonds to reserves. Doesn't seem related.

Option J: Percentage of deposits kept as reserves. That's the reserve ratio, not the multiplier.

So, from this, I'm a bit confused between options C, H, and maybe A. The term "monetary multiplier" is sometimes used interchangeably with "money multiplier." The money multiplier is the factor by which the money supply increases from the central bank's reserves. It's calculated as 1 divided by the reserve ratio.

Wait, the question specifies "monetary (or demand deposit) multiplier." So it's about demand deposits and how they relate to reserves. The demand deposit multiplier would be the total demand deposits created from the initial reserves. So the formula would be demand deposits = reserves multiplied by the multiplier.

Looking back, option C says the ratio of total demand deposits to total reserves. That would be the same as the multiplier. So if the multiplier is M, then M = demand deposits / reserves. So C says it's the ratio of demand deposits to reserves, which is correct.

But option H says it's the rate at which new money is created through fractional reserve banking for each dollar of central bank reserves. That sounds like the same thing as the multiplier. Because the multiplier tells you how much money is created per reserve dollar.

Wait, which one is correct? Let me think again. The monetary multiplier is the factor by which the money supply increases. So if you have $100 in reserves, and the multiplier is 5, then total deposits would be $500.

So the multiplier is demand deposits divided by reserves, which is option C. Alternatively, H describes the effect of the multiplier, not the definition. So H is more about the effect rather than the term itself.

Wait, the question is asking what is meant by the term and how it's calculated. So the term is the monetary multiplier, which is the ratio of total demand deposits to total reserves (option C). Alternatively, option H is describing the function of the multiplier.

Wait, let me check the exact wording of the options.

Option C: ratio of total demand deposits to total reserves of the system.

Option H: rate at which new money is created through fractional reserve banking for every dollar of central bank reserves.

Hmm. The monetary multiplier is indeed the ratio of total deposits to reserves, which is option C. But H is explaining the effect, which is that for each dollar of reserves, the multiplier creates that much money. So if the multiplier is 5, H would say 5 dollars of new money per reserve dollar.

Wait, but the term "monetary multiplier" is the ratio, so C is the definition. So the correct answer should be C.

But I'm a bit confused because sometimes I've heard the multiplier as the factor by which money expands, which is the same as C.

Alternatively, perhaps the term is sometimes referred to as the money multiplier, which is M = 1/(reserve ratio). So if the reserve ratio is r, then M = 1/r. So the multiplier is the inverse of the reserve ratio.

But looking at the options, option C is deposits over reserves, which is M. Option H is the rate of creation, which is M. So perhaps H is correct.

Wait, the question is about the term "monetary (or demand deposit) multiplier." So it's the same as the money multiplier, which is the ratio of total demand deposits to total reserves. So C is correct.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me think of an example. Suppose the central bank has $100 in reserves. If the reserve ratio is 20%, then banks must keep 20% of deposits as reserves. So the maximum amount of deposits that can be created is $500 (since 100 / 0.2 = 500). So the multiplier is 5, which is deposits ($500) divided by reserves ($100), so 5. So that's option C.

Alternatively, option H says it's the rate at which new money is created. So for each dollar of reserves, $5 of new money is created. That's the same as the multiplier, which is 5. So H is another way of expressing the same concept.

So the question is, which option defines the term correctly. The term "monetary multiplier" is the ratio of demand deposits to reserves, which is option C. Alternatively, option H is describing how it works.

Wait, the question says, "what is meant by the term... and how is it calculated?" So the answer should explain both the term and its calculation.

But looking at the options, option H says it's the rate at which new money is created, which is a description of the effect, not the term's definition. So the correct definition is the ratio, which is option C.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Another way to think: the monetary multiplier is often referred to as the money multiplier, which is 1/(reserve ratio). But the money multiplier is the same as the ratio of deposits to reserves, which is option C.

So I think the correct answer is C.

The monetary (or demand deposit) multiplier refers to the process by which banks create money through fractional reserve banking. It is calculated as the ratio of total demand deposits to total reserves in the banking system. This means that for every dollar of reserves, banks can create a multiple amount of demand deposits, thereby expanding the money supply. 

Option C correctly defines the monetary multiplier as the ratio of total demand deposits to total reserves, which aligns with the concept of how money is multiplied in the banking system.

Answer: C
