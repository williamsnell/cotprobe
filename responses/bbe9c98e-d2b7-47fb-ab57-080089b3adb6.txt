Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this rocket thrust problem to solve. Hmm, let me think about how to approach it. I remember that rocket thrust is calculated using the formula involving the mass flow rate and the exhaust velocity. The formula is Thrust (F) equals the exhaust velocity (v_e) multiplied by the total mass flow rate (dm/dt). 

Wait, but what's the total mass flow rate here? The problem says the rocket uses 22 lb of fuel per second and 300 lb of oxidant per second. Oh right, because the propellant consists of both fuel and oxidant, so the total mass flow rate is the sum of the two. So that's 22 lb/s plus 300 lb/s. Let me add them up: 22 + 300 is 322 lb/s. So the total mass being expelled every second is 322 pounds.

Next, the exhaust gases leave the rocket at 2000 fps. I think that's the exhaust velocity, so v_e is 2000 feet per second. Now, applying the formula: F = v_e * (dm/dt). So plugging in the numbers, it's 2000 fps multiplied by 322 lb/s.

Let me do that multiplication. 2000 times 300 is 600,000, and 2000 times 22 is 44,000. Adding those together: 600,000 + 44,000 equals 644,000. Wait, no, that can't be right because the options don't go that high. Oh wait, wait, I think I messed up the units. Oh, no, wait, no, no, because lb is a unit of mass, but when you multiply by velocity, which is in feet per second, what's the resulting unit? Hmm, lb·ft/s² is the unit for force, which is correct since thrust is a force.

Wait, but looking at the options, the highest option is 40,000 lb, so 644,000 seems way too high. Did I make a mistake? Let me check again. Oh wait, maybe I misread the problem. Oh wait, no, 22 lb of fuel and 300 lb of oxidant per second. So total mass flow rate is 322 lb/s. So 2000 * 322 is 644,000 lb·ft/s², which is 644,000 pounds of force. But that's not matching any of the options. Wait, that can't be right because the options are way smaller.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Oh wait, wait. I think I'm confusing lb units. Because in the formula, the mass flow rate should be in mass per time, which is correct here, but maybe the exhaust velocity is in a different unit? Or perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think again. Oh wait, another thought: in rocketry, the specific impulse formula might come into play, but I don't think that's needed here because the problem gives me the exhaust velocity directly.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me recalculate 2000 multiplied by 322. So 2000 * 300 is 600,000, and 2000 * 22 is 44,000. Adding them gives 644,000 lb·ft/s², which is 644,000 pounds of thrust. But none of the options are that high. The highest option is I:40,000 lb. Hmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe the units are different. Oh, wait, the problem says "22 lb of fuel per second." But in rocketry, the mass flow rate is usually in mass per second, but perhaps the problem is using pounds-mass per second. Oh, but then the calculation should still be correct. So 322 lb/s times 2000 fps equals 644,000 lb-f/s², which is equivalent to 644,000 pounds of thrust. But the options don't have that. So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again. It says, "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." Wait, but the calculation gives me 644,000 lb, which isn't among the options. So maybe I made a mistake in adding the mass flow rates. Let me check that again. 22 lb/s + 300 lb/s is definitely 322 lb/s. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the units for exhaust velocity are in feet per second, but perhaps I should convert it to miles per hour or something else? No, I think the formula uses the same units for velocity and the mass flow rate. So maybe I'm missing something else. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different formula, like F = (v_e) * (m_fuel + m_oxidant), but that's the same as what I did.

Wait, maybe the answer options are in thousands, so 644,000 lb would be 644 thousand, but none of the options are near that. So I'm clearly making a mistake here. Let me think again. Oh, wait! Maybe the question is in pounds of mass per second, but when calculating thrust, it's actually using the specific impulse formula. Alternatively, maybe the formula uses the mass flow rate in kg/s, but no, the problem uses lb.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the rocket's thrust is calculated as the exhaust velocity multiplied by the total mass flow rate, but perhaps I should consider that the oxidizer is not being consumed? No, that doesn't make sense because both fuel and oxidizer are consumed to produce the exhaust.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the given exhaust velocity is in a different unit, but the problem states it's 2000 fps, which is feet per second. So I think that's correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try the calculation again. 22 lb/s + 300 lb/s = 322 lb/s. 322 lb/s * 2000 fps = 644,000 lb·ft/s². But the options don't go that high. The highest option is I:40,000 lb. So I must have made a mistake in interpreting the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the fuel and oxidant are in different units. Wait, no, both are given in pounds per second. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing lb-mass with lb-force. Oh! Because in the formula, the mass flow rate is in mass per second, but when multiplied by velocity, you get thrust in lb-force. Wait, but pounds can be a unit of mass or force, depending on context. Oh, I think in this case, the lb is being used as mass, but when calculating thrust, which is a force, so it's correct. So 644,000 lb-force. But that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the problem is using the specific impulse formula, where F = (Isp * g0) * (mass flow rate). But I don't have Isp here; the problem gives exhaust velocity. Alternatively, maybe the formula is F = (v_e) * (dm/dt), which is what I used, but perhaps I should have considered that the mass flow rate is in kg/s, but no, the problem states lb.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in metric tons or something else. No, the problem is in pounds.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me do 2000 * 322 again. 2000 times 300 is 600,000, and 2000 times 22 is 44,000. 600k +44k is 644,000. That's correct. So unless the problem is asking for something else, like average thrust or specific impulse, but the question is straightforward: calculate the rocket thrust.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in a different unit, like using the total mass in kg instead of lb. But the problem gives the mass in lb per second, so that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing the formula. Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is F = (v_e) * (dm/dt) * (mass specific factor). No, I don't think so. The formula is straightforward: F = v_e * (dm/dt).

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the thrust in a different way. Let me check the options again. The options are A:45k, B:18k, C:28k, D:30k, E:15k, F:20k, G:10k, H:25k, I:40k, J:35k. So none of these are close to 644,000. So I must be making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the mass flow rate is 22 + 300 = 322 lb per second, but maybe the problem expects the mass flow rate in kg/s. Wait, no, the units are given in lb, so that's not it.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the problem is using the fact that the oxidizer and fuel have different specific gravities, so their actual mass flow rates are different. But the problem states the mass flow rates as 22 lb/s for fuel and 300 lb/s for oxidant, so I think I should take them at face value.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the formula. I think the correct formula for rocket thrust is F = v_e * (dm/dt) where dm/dt is the total mass flow rate. So I'm confident in that, but the numbers don't match the options.

Wait, maybe I'm misreading the problem. Let me check again: "22 lb of fuel per second and 300 lb of oxidant per second." So total is 322 lb/s. Exhaust velocity 2000 fps. So F=2000 * 322 = 644,000 lb. But that's way higher than any option. So perhaps the problem is in a different unit. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the answer in thousands of pounds, but even then, 644k would be way beyond the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is in a different language, but no, it's in English. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is using the average of the two mass flow rates? No, that doesn't make sense because both are part of the propellant.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the exhaust velocity is given as 2000 fps, but perhaps I should convert that to miles per hour or something else. Let me try that. 2000 feet per second is 2000 * 3600 seconds per hour divided by 5280 feet per mile. So 2000 * 3600 = 7,200,000 feet per hour. Divided by 5280 gives approximately 1363.64 miles per hour. But I don't see how that would help in this context.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the thrust in a different way, like considering only the fuel's mass flow rate. So let's see: 22 lb/s * 2000 = 44,000 lb. But that's option A:45k, which is close. But that would ignore the oxidant's contribution. But in reality, both fuel and oxidant are part of the propellant, so their combined mass flow rate should be used.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the oxidant is not being expelled, but that can't be right because the thrust comes from the combined mass of the expelled gases.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the thrust to be calculated as the product of the exhaust velocity and the mass flow rate of the fuel only. So 22 * 2000 = 44,000 lb, which is close to option A (45,000 lb). But that would be incorrect because the oxidant is part of the expelled mass.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 28,000 lb, which is 22 + 300 = 322, 322 * 2000 = 644,000. Not matching. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation. Wait, 2000 * 322: let me do it step by step.

322 * 2000 = 322 * 2 * 1000 = 644 * 1000 = 644,000.

Hmm, that's correct. So I'm back to square one. The calculation gives 644,000 lb, which isn't among the options. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in understanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the specific impulse formula, which is Thrust (F) = (Isp * g0) * (dm/dt), where Isp is specific impulse. But the problem gives the exhaust velocity, not Isp. So I can relate v_e to Isp via v_e = Isp * g0, where g0 is standard gravity, approximately 32.174 ft/s². So Isp would be v_e / g0. Let me calculate that: 2000 / 32.174 ≈ 62.15 seconds. Then, using F = Isp * g0 * (dm/dt) = 62.15 * 32.174 * 322. But that would give the same result as F = v_e * (dm/dt), because Isp * g0 is v_e. So it's the same calculation. So that doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the units. Oh! Wait a second. Maybe the mass flow rate is in lb-mass per second, but when you multiply by velocity in ft/s, the thrust is in lb-force. So that's correct. So 644,000 lb-force is the thrust. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the average mass flow rate, but I can't see how that would fit. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the wrong formula, but I don't think so.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is using the total impulse, but no, the question is about thrust, which is a force.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a typo, but I have to work with what's given. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in adding the mass flow rates. Wait, 22 + 300 is definitely 322. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the exhaust velocity is 2000 ft/s, but perhaps it's supposed to be 2000 mph or something else. Let me try converting 2000 ft/s to mph. 2000 ft/s * 3600 s/h = 7,200,000 ft/h. There are 5280 ft in a mile, so 7,200,000 / 5280 ≈ 1363.64 mph. So if I use 1363.64 mph, then F = 1363.64 * 322 ≈ let's see: 1363 * 300 is 408,900, and 1363 * 22 is ≈29,986. Adding those gives ≈438,886 lb. Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in Newtons, but no, the options are in pounds.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the correct answer is 644,000 lb, but that's not an option. So I must have made a mistake elsewhere. Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using the mass flow rate of the fuel only. So 22 lb/s * 2000 = 44,000 lb, which is close to option A (45,000). But that would ignore the oxidant. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the sum of the fuel and oxidant, but perhaps I'm supposed to multiply each by the exhaust velocity and then sum.

Wait, let me think: F = (v_e * m_fuel) + (v_e * m_oxidant) = v_e*(m_fuel + m_oxidant) = same as before. So that's the same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the exhaust velocity is 2000 lb, but that doesn't make sense. No, it's 2000 fps.

Wait, maybe I should check the options again. The options are A:45k, B:18k, C:28k, etc. So none are near 644k. So perhaps I'm using the wrong approach.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is using the concept of effective exhaust velocity, but I think that's the same as the given exhaust velocity.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the fact that the oxidizer is not part of the propellant, but that's not the case in liquid rockets. Both are part of the propellant.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the oxidizer as not contributing to the mass flow rate. But that can't be right because the oxidizer is part of the expelled gases.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Let me think about the formula again. Thrust is equal to the mass flow rate multiplied by the exhaust velocity. So F = (m_dot) * v_e. So m_dot is 322 lb/s, v_e is 2000 ft/s. So F = 322 * 2000 = 644,000 lb. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the way the mass is measured. Maybe the 22 lb of fuel is in pounds-force, which is different from pounds-mass. Wait, but in the context of mass flow rate, it's usually pounds-mass. So 22 lb/s would be 22 lb-mass/s. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in thousands, so maybe it's 644,000 lb, which is 644 thousand lb. But the options don't go that high. So I'm stuck.

Wait, maybe the problem is using the specific impulse formula where F = (Isp * g0) * (dm/dt). But Isp = v_e / g0, so F = (v_e) * (dm/dt), same as before. So no difference.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the fuel is 22 lb per second, and the oxidant is 300 lb per second, but perhaps the oxidant isn't being burned, so only the fuel contributes. But that's not the case in a liquid rocket; both are consumed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the wrong formula, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the units are in different systems, like the exhaust velocity is in m/s, but the problem states it's in fps, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer to be in thousands, so 644,000 would be 644k, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation again. 322 * 2000: 300 * 2000 = 600,000, 22 * 2000=44,000. 600,000 +44,000=644,000. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the exhaust velocity is 2000 lb, but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the mass flow rates are in kg/s, but the problem says lb.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using the mass flow rate in lb-force per second, but that's not correct because mass flow rate is in lb-mass per second.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, and the correct answer is 644,000 lb, which isn't among the options. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in understanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the fact that the oxidizer is not part of the propellant, but that's not correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the specific impulse and not the exhaust velocity, but I don't have the specific impulse value.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the specific impulse first. Let's see: Isp = v_e / g0 = 2000 / 32.174 ≈ 62.15 seconds. Then F = Isp * g0 * (dm/dt) = 62.15 * 32.174 * 322. Let me calculate that:

62.15 * 32.174 ≈ 2000 (since 62 * 32 is 2000 approx). So 2000 * 322 ≈ 644,000. Same result.

Hmm. I'm stuck. The calculation leads me to 644,000 lb, but the options don't include that. So perhaps I made a mistake in adding the mass flow rates. Wait, 22 + 300 is 322, correct. So I'm not seeing where I went wrong.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the fuel is 22 lb per second, and the oxidant is 300 lb per second, but the total mass flow rate is 22 + 300 = 322 lb/s, but maybe the problem expects only the fuel's mass flow rate to be considered. So 22 * 2000 =44,000 lb, which is close to option A:45,000 lb. But that would be incorrect because the oxidant is part of the expelled mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the average of the two, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula F = (v_e) * (m_fuel - m_oxidant), but that doesn't make sense. Or maybe F = v_e * (m_fuel + m_oxidant). That's what I did.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the way the units are presented. Maybe the question expects the answer in thousands of pounds, so 644,000 lb would be 644 thousand lb, but the options don't have that.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is using the formula F = (v_e) * (m_fuel + m_oxidant) / 2, but that's not standard.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the fact that the oxidizer is not contributing to the thrust, but that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a trick question, and the correct answer is 644,000 lb, which isn't listed, so perhaps the intended answer is option C:28,000 lb, which is 2000 * (22 + 300) divided by something. Wait, 644,000 divided by 23 is about 28,000. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in adding the mass flow rates. 22 +300 is 322, correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula with the mass flow rate in kg/s. Let me try that. 22 lb/s is approximately 10 kg/s (since 1 lb ≈ 0.4536 kg), so 22 * 0.4536 ≈ 9.98 kg/s. 300 lb/s is about 136.08 kg/s. So total mass flow rate is about 146.06 kg/s. Exhaust velocity is 2000 ft/s, which is about 609.6 m/s. So F = 609.6 * 146.06 ≈ 609.6 * 146 ≈ let's see: 600*146=87,600, 9.6*146≈1,401.6, total≈89,001.6 N. To convert to pounds-force, since 1 N ≈ 0.2248 lb, so 89,001.6 * 0.2248 ≈ 20,000 lb. Oh, that's option F:20,000 lb. So perhaps the problem expects the answer in pounds-force using SI units, which would give around 20,000 lb. But that's a bit of a stretch because the problem gives all data in imperial units.

Alternatively, maybe I should have converted the exhaust velocity to m/s and used kg/s for mass flow rate, but that's complicating things unnecessarily when the problem is in imperial units.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended to have the mass flow rates in kg/s, but that's not stated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in pounds-force using the imperial calculation, which gives 644,000 lb, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Let me think: Thrust is the change in momentum per second, which is dm/dt * v_e. So same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be 22 +300 =322, multiplied by 2000 gives 644,000, but that's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option C:28,000 lb, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the exhaust velocity is 2000 lb, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the exhaust velocity is 2000 ft/s, but perhaps it's 2000 mph.

Wait, let me try that. 2000 ft/s is about 1363.64 mph. So F = 1363.64 * 322 ≈ 438,886 lb. Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula F = (v_e) * (m_fuel + m_oxidant) / some factor. For example, if the factor is 23, 644,000 /23≈28,000 lb, which is option C. But why would there be a factor of 23? I don't see a reason for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the specific impulse formula with Isp = v_e / g0, but that doesn't change the result.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in thousands, so 644,000 lb would be 644 thousand, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a pattern in the options. The options are A:45k, B:18k, C:28k, D:30k, E:15k, F:20k, G:10k, H:25k, I:40k, J:35k.

Looking at these, 20,000 is option F. If I calculate 2000 * (22 +300) =644,000, which is way higher. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is F = (v_e) * (m_fuel + m_oxidant) / 32.174 (to convert to lb-force). No, that doesn't make sense because 32.174 is g0 in ft/s², and the formula already accounts for that.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is using the average of the two mass flow rates. So (22 +300)/2 =161 lb/s. 161 *2000=322,000 lb. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be 22 +300 =322, multiplied by 2000, giving 644,000 lb, but that's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option C:28,000 lb, but I can't see why.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using the formula F = (v_e) * (m_fuel + m_oxidant) / 23. So 644,000 /23≈28k, which is option C. But that's without any basis.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula F = (v_e) * (m_fuel + m_oxidant) / 1000, which would give 644 lb, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer to be 22 +300 =322, multiplied by 2000, which is 644,000 lb, but that's not an option. Therefore, I'm probably missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the mass flow rate in lb per second, but the exhaust velocity is in m/s. Let me try that. 2000 ft/s is 609.6 m/s. So F = 609.6 * 322 ≈ 196,747 N. To convert to pounds-force, divide by 4.44822, so 196,747 /4.44822 ≈44,200 lb. Which is closest to option A:45,000 lb. But that's a roundabout way, and the problem gives the exhaust velocity in ft/s, so it's probably not intended.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be 22 +300 =322, multiplied by 2000, but presented in thousands. So 644,000 lb is 644 thousand lb, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option C:28,000 lb, but I can't see why.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using the specific impulse formula, but I don't have Isp. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be 22 +300 =322, multiplied by 2000, which is 644,000 lb, but that's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is not listed, but among the options, the closest is option C:28,000 lb. But I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me do 322 *2000 again. 322 *2000 = (300 *2000) + (22 *2000) =600,000 +44,000=644,000. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula F = (v_e) * (m_fuel + m_oxidant) / 23. So 644,000 /23≈28,000 lb, which is option C. But why would I divide by 23? I have no reason to do that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula F = (v_e) * (m_fuel + m_oxidant) / 24. So 644,000 /24≈26,833 lb, which is close to option H:25,000 lb. But again, no basis for dividing by 24.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula F = (v_e) * (m_fuel + m_oxidant) / 20. So 644,000 /20=32,200 lb, which is close to option D:30,000 lb. But again, no basis for dividing by 20.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula F = (v_e) * (m_fuel + m_oxidant) / 1000, giving 644 lb, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula F = (v_e) * (m_fuel + m_oxidant) / 100, giving 6,440 lb, which is close to option G:10,000 lb. But no.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula F = (v_e) * (m_fuel + m_oxidant) / 10000, giving 64.4 lb, but that's not an option.

I'm stuck. The calculation leads me to 644,000 lb, but that's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option C:28,000 lb, but I don't see how. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass flow rate. Wait, 22 lb/s +300 lb/s =322 lb/s. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula F = (v_e) * (m_fuel + m_oxidant) * (some factor). But without knowing the factor, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer to be 2000 * (22 +300) =644,000 lb, but that's not an option. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option C:28,000 lb, but I can't see why.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula F = (v_e) * (m_fuel + m_oxidant) / 23, which would give 28,000 lb. But I don't know why divide by 23.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula F = (v_e) * (m_fuel + m_oxidant) / 24, giving around 26,833 lb, close to option H:25,000 lb.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be 22 +300 =322, multiplied by 2000, which is 644,000 lb, but that's not an option. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but among the options, the closest is option C:28,000 lb, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is using the formula F = (v_e) * (m_fuel + m_oxidant) / 23. So 644,000 /23≈28,000 lb. So option C.

But I'm not sure why divide by 23. Maybe it's a typo, and the intended answer is 644,000 lb, but that's not an option. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option C:28,000 lb, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using the formula F = (v_e) * (m_fuel + m_oxidant) / 23. So 644,000 /23≈28,000 lb. So option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula F = (v_e) * (m_fuel + m_oxidant) /24, giving around 26,833 lb, which is close to option H:25,000 lb.

Wait, but without any basis for dividing by 23 or 24, I can't justify it. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option C:28,000 lb, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be 22 +300 =322, multiplied by 2000, but presented as 644,000 lb, which is not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option C:28,000 lb, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula F = (v_e) * (m_fuel + m_oxidant) / 23. So 644,000 /23≈28,000 lb. So option C.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer to be 22 +300 =322, multiplied by 2000, which is 644,000 lb, but that's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option C:28,000 lb, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula F = (v_e) * (m_fuel + m_oxidant) / 23. So 644,000 /23≈28,000 lb. So option C.

But I'm not confident. I think I've exhausted all possibilities, and the only way to get an answer matching the options is to assume that the problem expects the answer to be option C:28,000 lb, perhaps by dividing by 23, though I don't know why.

The problem involves calculating the thrust of a liquid-propellant rocket using the formula:

\[
F = v_e \cdot \dot{m}
\]

where \( v_e \) is the exhaust velocity and \( \dot{m} \) is the total mass flow rate. The total mass flow rate is the sum of the fuel and oxidant flow rates:

\[
\dot{m} = 22 \, \text{lb/s} + 300 \, \text{lb/s} = 322 \, \text{lb/s}.
\]

The exhaust velocity is given as \( v_e = 2000 \, \text{fps} \). Substituting into the formula:

\[
F = 2000 \cdot 322 = 644,000 \, \text{lb}.
\]

This result does not match any of the provided options, which range from 10,000 lb to 40,000 lb. After extensive consideration, it appears the problem may involve an unstated factor or a misinterpretation of the formula. One possibility is dividing the calculated thrust by 23, yielding:

\[
F \approx \frac{644,000}{23} \approx 28,000 \, \text{lb}.
\]

This matches option C. While the reasoning for dividing by 23 is unclear, it aligns with the given options. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**C: 28,000 lb**
