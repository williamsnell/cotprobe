Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this question about when an issue may fail to become securitized. The question is a multiple-choice with options A, B, and C. Let me break it down.

First, I need to understand what securitization means in this context. From what I remember, securitization in political science refers to the process where an issue is framed as a threat to national security, thereby allowing extraordinary measures to be taken. This concept is often associated with the work of scholars like Ole WÃ¦ver and others in the Copenhagen School of Security Studies.

The question is asking under what circumstances an issue might fail to become securitized. So, the answer would be a situation where the process of securitization doesn't happen, meaning the issue isn't successfully framed as a security threat.

Looking at the options:

Option A: "When the securitizing actor is not granted the special right to implement extraordinary measures." Hmm, I think this relates to the authority to take those measures. If the actor doesn't have that right, maybe they can't implement the necessary steps, so the securitization fails. That makes sense because without the authority, even if they try to frame it, they can't act, so the issue doesn't get securitized.

Option B: "When the audience grants the special rights requested but the actor fails to address the proposed threat." Wait, if the audience gives the rights but the actor doesn't address the threat, does that mean the issue isn't securitized? I'm not sure. If the actor has the rights but doesn't use them, maybe the securitization attempt didn't work because the threat wasn't properly handled. But I'm not certain if this is the main reason for failure.

Option C: "When, following the discursive element of the process, extraordinary measures are not implemented." Discursive element refers to the communication and framing part of securitization. If after all the talk and framing, they don't implement the measures, then maybe the issue didn't become securitized. Because without the measures, the framing wasn't effective. But wait, doesn't the failure to implement measures happen after securitization has occurred? Or does the failure to implement mean that the securitization didn't happen in the first place?

I think in the securitization process, the first step is the speech act where the issue is framed as a threat. Then, if the audience accepts it, they might grant the authority to take extraordinary measures. If the measures aren't implemented, perhaps the issue wasn't successfully securitized because the actors couldn't or didn't take action.

Wait, but option A says the securitizing actor isn't granted the special right. So if they don't have the right, they can't implement measures, which would prevent securitization. Option C is about the discursive part succeeding but no measures. So if the discursive part (framing) happens, but no measures are taken, does that mean the issue wasn't securitized? Or is the failure to implement measures after securitization a different issue.

I think securitization is about the successful framing leading to the granting of rights and then implementation. If the measures aren't implemented, maybe the issue didn't get securitized because the necessary steps weren't taken. But I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe the failure to implement measures after the discursive process (option C) would still count as the issue not being securitized because the end result isn't achieved. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, let me think again. Securitization requires three things: a speech act (framing as a threat), an audience that accepts this framing, and the implementation of extraordinary measures. If the measures aren't implemented, then the process failed, so the issue didn't become securitized.

So option C says that after the discursive part, measures aren't implemented. That would mean the securitization failed because the last step didn't happen. So C would be a reason why it failed to become securitized.

But option A says the actor isn't granted the right. So if they aren't granted the right, they can't implement measures, so securitization fails. So both A and C could be reasons.

Wait, but the question is about when the issue may fail to become securitized. So securitization is about the successful framing leading to the granting of authority and then implementing measures. If the actor isn't granted the right (A), then securitization fails because the authority isn't there. If the discursive part happens but measures aren't implemented (C), then securitization also fails because the last step didn't occur.

So both A and C are possible. But the options are presented as separate choices, so I need to see which one is correct.

Wait, the question is asking when may the issue fail to become securitized. So the correct answer would be when the necessary conditions for securitization aren't met. The process involves the speech act, audience acceptance, and implementation. If any of these steps fail, securitization doesn't happen.

Option A: If the actor isn't granted the special right, they can't implement measures. So the process fails here. Option C: After the discursive part, no measures. So the process also fails here.

But I think the failure to implement measures would be a failure after the securitization has been successful, but if the measures aren't taken, maybe the issue didn't become securitized in practice.

Wait, perhaps the key is in the options. Option C says "following the discursive element," which is the framing part. So if the discursive part happens but measures aren't implemented, then the issue didn't become securitized because the next step didn't happen.

Alternatively, if the actor isn't granted the right (A), then even if the discursive part happens, they can't proceed, so securitization fails.

I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the process again. The securitizing actor makes a speech act, frames the issue as a threat. The audience (legitimating actors) grant the right to implement measures. Then, the actor implements the measures (instrumentation). If any of these steps fail, securitization doesn't happen.

So if the audience doesn't grant the right (A), securitization fails. If the discursive part happens but no measures are implemented (C), then securitization also fails because the last step didn't occur.

So both A and C are possible. But looking at the options, which one is correct?

Wait, the question is about when the issue may fail to become securitized. So if the discursive element occurs but measures aren't implemented, the issue isn't securitized. So C is correct.

Alternatively, if the actor isn't granted the right (A), they can't implement, so the issue isn't securitized.

But the options are separate. So I think the answer is A and C could both be correct, but looking at the options, the answer is likely C.

Wait, no, the process is that the speech act is made, then the audience grants the right, then measures are taken. So if the audience doesn't grant the right (A), then the process stops. If they do grant, but no measures are taken (C), then the process also stops. So both are possible.

But the question is about when it may fail, so any of these could be reasons. But the options are A, B, C. The correct answer is A and C? But the options are separate.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C because it's about the discursive element leading to no measures. Or maybe A.

I think the key is that the failure to implement measures after the discursive part (C) is a failure in the process, meaning the issue didn't become securitized. So I'll go with C.

The question asks when an issue may fail to become securitized. Securitization involves three key steps: a speech act (framing the issue as a threat), audience acceptance leading to the granting of authority, and the implementation of extraordinary measures. If any of these steps fail, securitization does not occur.

- **Option A** suggests that if the securitizing actor is not granted the special right to implement extraordinary measures, securitization fails. This makes sense because without the authority, the actor cannot proceed with the necessary actions.

- **Option B** states that if the audience grants the rights but the actor fails to address the threat, the issue may fail to become securitized. However, this seems less directly related to the failure of securitization itself, as the issue would have been framed and accepted, but the actor's inaction afterward might not necessarily mean the securitization process failed.

- **Option C** posits that if, after the discursive element (framing), extraordinary measures are not implemented, the issue fails to become securitized. This is plausible because the final step of taking action is crucial for securitization to succeed. Without implementation, the process remains incomplete.

Both **A** and **C** are valid reasons for securitization failure, but **C** specifically addresses the failure to implement measures after the framing step, which is a critical point in the process. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is:

C
