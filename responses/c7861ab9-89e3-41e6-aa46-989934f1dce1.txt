Okay, so I have this question about accounting terms, and I need to figure out the answer. The question is asking about the difference between assets and liabilities and what that's called. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that assets and liabilities are both parts of the balance sheet. Assets are things the company owns, like cash, inventory, buildings, etc. Liabilities are what the company owes, like loans, accounts payable, and other debts.

The question is asking for the difference between these two. I think there's a term in accounting for when you subtract liabilities from assets. Oh right, that's called equity. But wait, equity can also be referred to as owner's equity or capital. Let me check the options to see which one matches.

Looking at the options, option G is "capital or owner's equity." That seems right because assets minus liabilities equal equity. So the difference is the company's equity, which is the owner's claim on the business after subtracting what's owed.

Let me make sure none of the other options fit. Option A is current ratio, which is a liquidity ratio, so that's not it. Option B, net profit, is an income statement term. Option C, revenue, is also income related. Option D, gross income, same as revenue. Option E is net worth, which is another term for equity, but the answer might be referring to the more common term. Option F is cash flow, which is about the movement of cash. Option H is equity ratio, which is a ratio of equity to assets, not the difference. Option I is operating expenses, which are costs related to running the business. Option J is retained earnings, which is part of equity but not the overall difference.

So the correct term is either E or G. Wait, E is net worth, which is the same as equity. But option G says "capital or owner's equity," so that's more precise. So the answer should be G.

The difference between assets and liabilities is known as equity, which is also referred to as capital or owner's equity. This is calculated as assets minus liabilities. 

Answer: G
