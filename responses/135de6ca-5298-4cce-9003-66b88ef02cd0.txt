Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out the limit as n approaches infinity of (n! * F_n(1)) divided by log(n). The function F starts with F_0(x) = log(x), and each subsequent F_{n+1}(x) is the integral from 0 to x of F_n(t) dt. Hmm, that sounds a bit recursive and involves integrals, so maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for F_n(1) in terms of n.

Let me start by understanding what F_n(x) looks like for small n. 

F_0(x) is given as log(x). Then F_1(x) is the integral from 0 to x of log(t) dt. Wait, integrating log(t) from 0 to x. I remember that the integral of log(t) is t log(t) - t. But wait, when t approaches 0, log(t) tends to negative infinity, but t log(t) approaches 0 because t goes to zero faster than log(t) goes to negative infinity. So F_1(x) would be [x log(x) - x] evaluated from 0 to x, which is x log(x) - x.

Wait, but wait, when I integrate log(t) from 0 to x, I should check if that's correct. Let me compute it again. The integral of log(t) dt is t log(t) - t, right? So F_1(x) = x log(x) - x - [0 * log(0) - 0]. Since 0 * log(0) is 0 (because limit as t→0+ of t log(t) is 0), so F_1(x) is x log(x) - x.

So F_1(1) would be (1 * log(1)) - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1.

Now F_2(x) is the integral from 0 to x of F_1(t) dt, which is the integral of (t log(t) - t) dt from 0 to x. Let's compute that.

The integral of t log(t) is t²/2 * log(t) - t²/(4), right? Because integration by parts: let u = log(t), dv = t dt. Then du = (1/t) dt, v = t²/2. So it's (t²/2) log(t) - ∫ (t²/2)(1/t) dt = (t²/2) log(t) - ∫ (t/2) dt = (t²/2) log(t) - t²/(4). 

Then the integral of -t is -t²/2. So putting it all together, F_2(x) is [ (x²/2) log(x) - x²/4 ] - [ x²/2 ] + C, but since we're integrating from 0 to x, the constants at 0 should be zero. Evaluating at x gives F_2(x) = (x²/2) log(x) - x²/4 - x²/2 = (x²/2) log(x) - (3x²)/4.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure I did that correctly. Alternatively, maybe I should write F_2(x) as the integral from 0 to x of F_1(t) dt, which is ∫ (t log t - t) dt. So that's ∫ t log t dt minus ∫ t dt. 

As I did before, ∫ t log t dt is (t²/2) log t - t²/4, and ∫ t dt is t²/2. So F_2(x) = [ (x²/2) log x - x²/4 ] - [x²/2] = (x²/2) log x - x²/4 - x²/2 = (x²/2) log x - (3x²)/4.

So F_2(1) = (1/2) log(1) - 3/4 = 0 - 3/4 = -3/4.

Hmm, seeing a pattern here. F_0(1) = log(1) = 0. F_1(1) = -1. F_2(1) = -3/4. Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, no, F_1(1) was -1, F_2(1) is -3/4, so it seems like F_n(1) alternates in sign but perhaps converges to a positive value as n increases? Or maybe not. Let me compute F_3(1) to see.

F_3(x) is the integral from 0 to x of F_2(t) dt, which is ∫ (t²/2 log t - 3t²/4) dt from 0 to x.

Let me compute each term separately. The integral of (t²/2) log t dt. Again, integration by parts: Let u = log t, dv = t²/2 dt. Then du = (1/t) dt, v = t³/(6). So ∫ (t²/2) log t dt = (t³/6) log t - ∫ (t³/6)(1/t) dt = (t³/6) log t - ∫ t²/6 dt = (t³/6) log t - t³/(18) + C.

Then the integral of -3t²/4 is -3 ∫ t²/4 dt = -3*(t³)/(12) = -t³/4.

So F_3(x) is [ (x³/6) log x - x³/(18) ] - [x³/4 ] = (x³/6) log x - x³/(18) - x³/4.

Combining terms: Let's find a common denominator for the coefficients. 18 and 4 have a common denominator of 36. So:

- x³/(18) = -2x³/36,
- x³/4 = 9x³/36.

So F_3(x) = (x³/6) log x - (2x³ + 9x³)/36 = (x³/6) log x - (11x³)/36.

Thus, F_3(1) = (1/6) log1 - 11/36 = 0 - 11/36 = -11/36 ≈ -0.3056.

Wait, but wait, that seems inconsistent with F_2(1) being -3/4, which is -0.75. So F_3(1) is -11/36 ≈ -0.3056. Hmm, so alternating signs? Wait no, all of them so far are negative. Wait, F_0(1)=0, F_1(1)=-1, F_2(1)=-3/4, F_3(1)=-11/36. Hmm, seems like each F_n(1) is negative, but perhaps approaching zero? Or maybe not. Let me see the pattern in the coefficients.

Wait, F_1(1)=-1, which is -1/1.

F_2(1)=-3/4 = -3/(2^2).

F_3(1)=-11/36 = -11/(6^2).

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps F_n(1) can be expressed as (-1)^n times some coefficient over n!? Not sure yet.

Alternatively, maybe F_n(1) is (-1)^n (H_n) / n! where H_n is the nth harmonic number. Wait, that might be a stretch, but let's see.

Wait, for n=1: F_1(1) = -1 = (-1)^1 * 1/1! → 1/1! is 1, so that's correct.

n=2: F_2(1) = -3/4. Hmm, H_2 is 1 + 1/2 = 3/2. So if it were (-1)^2 * H_2/(2!) = (3/2)/2 = 3/4. But F_2(1) is -3/4, so perhaps with an extra negative sign? Not sure.

Wait, maybe it's (-1)^n H_n /n! . Then for n=1: (-1)^1 H_1/1! = -1/1! = -1, which matches. For n=2: (-1)^2 H_2/2! = (3/2)/2 = 3/4, but F_2(1) is -3/4. So that doesn't match the sign. Hmm, maybe there's a different pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps F_n(1) = (-1)^n (something involving n) / n!.

Wait, let's think about the general approach. The problem involves repeated integrations, so perhaps F_n(x) can be expressed as a series involving terms like x^k log(x) or something similar. Alternatively, maybe using generating functions or recognizing a pattern from the integrals.

Alternatively, perhaps each F_n(x) is of the form x^{n} (something) log x - x^{n} (something else). Let me see:

F_0(x) = log x.

F_1(x) = x log x - x.

F_2(x) = (x^2/2) log x - (3x^2)/4.

F_3(x) = (x^3/6) log x - (11x^3)/36.

Hmm, perhaps the coefficients of x^n log x involve 1/n! ?

Wait, for F_1(x), the coefficient of x log x is 1/1! = 1.

F_2(x): coefficient is 1/2! = 1/2. Wait, but in F_2, the coefficient is 1/2, which is 1/2!.

Similarly, F_3(x) has coefficient 1/6, which is 1/3!.

So perhaps F_n(x) can be written as x^n (1/(n!)) log x minus some other term involving x^n times (some coefficient). So F_n(x) = (x^n)/(n!) log x - x^n * (a_n), where a_n is some sequence.

Then F_n(1) would be (1/(n!)) log 1 - 1 * a_n = 0 - a_n = -a_n.

So F_n(1) = -a_n.

Now, let's see what a_n is for the first few n.

n=1: F_1(x)=x log x - x. So a_1 = 1.

n=2: F_2(x)= (x^2/2) log x - (3x^2)/4 → a_2 = 3/4.

n=3: F_3(x)= (x^3/6) log x - (11x^3)/36 → a_3 = 11/36.

Hmm, what's the pattern for a_n?

Looking at a_1=1, a_2=3/4, a_3=11/36.

Let me see:

a_1=1 = 1/1.

a_2=3/4 = 3/(2^2).

a_3=11/36=11/(6^2).

Wait, 6 is 3!.

Wait, 3! =6, so 36= (3!)^2.

Wait, 3/4 is 3/( (2)^2 ), and 11/36 is 11/(6^2). So perhaps a_n = (something) / (n!)^2.

Wait, for n=1: 1 = 1/(1!)^2.

n=2: 3/(2^2) = 3/(2!)^2.

n=3: 11/(6^2) = 11/(3!)^2.

So maybe a_n = (2^n -1)/(n!)^2 ?

Wait, for n=1: 2^1 -1 =1 → 1/(1)^2=1 → a_1=1: correct.

n=2: 2^2 -1=3 → 3/(2!^2)=3/4: correct.

n=3: 2^3 -1=7 → 7/(3!^2)=7/36, but a_3 is 11/36. Hmm, that doesn't match. So perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe a_n is (n+1)/(n!^2). For n=1: 2/(1!^2)=2, which doesn't match a_1=1. No, that's not it.

Alternatively, let's see if a_n is related to the nth harmonic number H_n.

H_n = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n.

Compute H_1=1, H_2=1.5, H_3≈1.8333.

But a_1=1=1*(1), a_2=3/4=0.75, which is less than H_2=1.5, so maybe not directly.

Alternatively, perhaps a_n = (H_n)/(n!)? For n=1, H_1=1, so 1/1!=1: correct.

n=2: H_2=1.5=3/2. 3/2 divided by 2!=2 → (3/2)/2=3/4: correct.

n=3: H_3=11/6. Divided by 3!=6 → (11/6)/6=11/36: correct. Oh! So a_n = H_n / n!.

So that gives F_n(1) = -a_n = -H_n / n!.

Wait, that's a neat pattern. Let me verify:

For n=1: F_1(1) = -1 = -H_1 / 1! → H_1=1, so yes.

n=2: F_2(1)=-3/4 = -H_2 / 2! → H_2=1+1/2=3/2, so (3/2)/2=3/4, so F_2(1)=-3/4. Correct.

n=3: F_3(1)=-11/36 = -H_3/3! → H_3=1+1/2+1/3=11/6, so (11/6)/6=11/36. Correct.

So that seems to hold. So generalizing, F_n(1) = - H_n / n!.

So the limit we're supposed to compute is lim_{n→∞} [n! F_n(1)] / log(n) = lim [n! (-H_n /n! ) ] / log(n) = lim [ -H_n ] / log(n).

So that's lim_{n→∞} (-H_n) / log(n). Hmm, but H_n is the nth harmonic number, which is approximately log(n) + γ + o(1), where γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant (~0.5772). So H_n ≈ log(n) + γ.

So substituting, (-H_n) ≈ - (log(n) + γ). So (-H_n)/log(n) ≈ [ - log(n) - γ ] / log(n) = -1 - γ / log(n).

As n approaches infinity, γ / log(n) approaches 0. So the limit becomes (-1 - 0) = -1.

Wait, but the options given are:

A: π

B: 1.0

C: 1/n

D: 2.0

E: -1.0

F: e

G: -e

H: e^-1

I: 0.0

J: Infinity

So if the limit is -1, then the answer would be E: -1.0.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the sign. Because F_n(1) = - H_n / n!, so n! F_n(1) = - H_n. Then [n! F_n(1)] / log(n) = (- H_n) / log(n) ≈ (- (log n + γ )) / log n = -1 - γ / log n. As n→infty, this approaches -1.

So the limit is -1, which is option E.

Alternatively, let me think again: is F_n(1) = - H_n /n! ?

From the examples we've checked, it holds for n=1,2,3. So I think it's correct.

Thus, the limit is -1. So the answer is E.
</think>

The problem involves evaluating the limit as \( n \) approaches infinity of \( \frac{n! F_n(1)}{\log(n)} \), where \( F_0(x) = \log(x) \) and \( F_{n+1}(x) = \int_0^x F_n(t) \, dt \). By computing the first few \( F_n(1) \), we observe a pattern where \( F_n(1) = -\frac{H_n}{n!} \), with \( H_n \) being the \( n \)-th harmonic number. Substituting this into the limit expression, we find that the limit simplifies to \( -1 \).
