<think>
Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the equilibrium constant Kp for the dissociation of I2 into 2I. Hmm, I remember that the equilibrium constant depends on the Gibbs free energy change, which in turn is calculated using the standard enthalpy and entropy changes. But wait, the problem gives some specific data about vibrational frequencies and the dissociation energy. I need to think about how all this connects.

First, the reaction is I2(g) → 2I(g). The temperature is 1000 K, and pressure is 1 atm. The fundamental vibrational frequency of I2 is 214.4 cm^-1. The internuclear distance is 0.2667 nm. I'm a bit rusty on the formulas here. Oh right, the vibrational frequency relates to the bond strength. The dissociation energy is given as 1.542 eV. Wait, but I think I might need to find the bond energy to compute the enthalpy change.

The dissociation energy (D) is the energy required to break the bond in I2. I recall that bond energy (D) is related to the force constant (k) and the reduced mass (μ) through the formula D = (h * v) / (2), where h is Planck's constant. Wait, no, actually, the dissociation energy is approximately the depth of the potential well, so maybe it's given directly as 1.542 eV, which I can convert to Joules if needed.

But wait, the question also mentions the ground state of I is a doublet ^2P_{3/2,1/2} with a separation of 7603 cm^-1. I'm not sure how that plays into this. Oh, maybe it's related to the rotational or vibrational energy levels. Wait, no, perhaps it's the energy difference between the two states of I atoms. Hmm. Or maybe it's the energy required to excite the electronic state, contributing to the Gibbs free energy.

Wait, the reaction is dissociating into two I atoms, each in the ground state. So I think the standard enthalpy of formation might be involved. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, maybe I should look at the entropy change. The reaction goes from one mole of I2 to two moles of I. So the entropy change (ΔS) would be R ln(2^2) = 2R ln2. Wait, wait, no, the number of moles of gas increases from 1 to 2, so the entropy change is R ln(2) per mole, so for 2 moles, it's 2 R ln2. Wait, no, the formula is ΔS = R ln(P2/P1). Since initially, it's 1 mole, and finally, 2 moles. So ΔS = R ln(2^2) = 2 R ln2. Wait, actually, no, because the entropy is calculated as ΔS = R ln( (products)^n_products / (reactants)^n_reactants ). So for the reaction I2 → 2I, the change is S°(products) - S°(reactants) = [2 S°(I)] - [S°(I2)]. But I think for diatomic molecules like I2, the standard molar entropy is known, but I don't remember the exact values.

Alternatively, maybe I can approximate the change in entropy using the ideal gas formula. Since the number of moles of gas increases by 1 (from 1 to 2 moles), the entropy change would be R ln(2). Because for ideal gases, the entropy change is R ln(P2/P1), and here the pressure halves because the moles double, but wait no, pressure isn't directly given, but the reaction is at constant pressure. Hmm, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be.

Wait, maybe the key here is to calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) using the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) and the entropy change (ΔS°), and then relate that to the equilibrium constant Kp via the equation ΔG° = -RT ln Kp.

So ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°.

I need to find ΔH° for the reaction. Since the reaction is I2 dissociating into 2I, the standard enthalpy change would be the bond dissociation energy. The bond energy for I2 is given as 1.542 eV per molecule. Wait, but that's per molecule, so for two I atoms, we'd have 2 * (1.542 eV / 2) because each bond contributes to one mole. Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of per mole basis.

Wait, 1 eV is approximately 96.485 kJ/mol. So 1.542 eV per molecule is 1.542 * 96.485 kJ/mol. Let me compute that: 1.542 * 96.485 ≈ 148.7 kJ/mol. But wait, that's per molecule, so for a mole, it would be 148.7 kJ per mole of I2. So the bond energy is 148.7 kJ/mol. So the enthalpy change for the reaction I2 → 2I would be +148.7 kJ/mol because it's endothermic (requires energy to break the bond).

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused here. The standard enthalpy of formation of I2 is zero because it's an element in its standard state. The standard enthalpy of formation of I atom is positive, so the ΔH° for the reaction would be 2 * (ΔHf° of I) - (ΔHf° of I2). Since ΔHf° of I2 is zero, it's 2 * (ΔHf° of I). But I don't have the value of ΔHf° of I. Alternatively, perhaps the bond dissociation energy is the same as the enthalpy change for the reaction. So ΔH° = 148.7 kJ/mol.

Now, the entropy change ΔS°. For the reaction, we go from 1 mole of I2 (gas) to 2 moles of I (gas). So the entropy change is ΔS° = S°(2 I) - S°(I2) = 2 S°(I) - S°(I2). I think the standard molar entropy values are needed here. I'm not sure of the exact values, but I can look them up mentally. For example, S° for I2(g) is around 260 J/mol·K, and S° for I(g) is around 208 J/mol·K. So, ΔS° = 2*(208) - 260 = 416 - 260 = 156 J/mol·K. That's 156 J/(mol*K) which is 0.156 kJ/(mol*K).

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for entropy when the number of moles changes. Since we're going from 1 to 2 moles of gas, the entropy change is R ln(2) per mole. So for 1 mole of I2 producing 2 moles of I, the change would be R * ln(2^2) = 2 R ln2. Let me compute that: R is 8.314 J/mol·K. ln2 is about 0.693. So 2 * 8.314 * 0.693 ≈ 2 * 8.314 * 0.693 ≈ 11.5 J/mol·K. Wait, that's 0.0115 kJ/mol·K. Hmm, that's much lower than the 0.156 kJ/mol·K I calculated earlier. So which approach is correct?

I think the standard molar entropy approach is more accurate because it uses known values. So I'll proceed with ΔS° = 0.156 kJ/(mol·K).

Now, let's calculate ΔG° using ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°. T is 1000 K.

ΔH° is 148.7 kJ/mol. TΔS° is 1000 K * 0.156 kJ/(mol·K) = 156 kJ/mol.

So ΔG° = 148.7 - 156 = -7.3 kJ/mol. Wait, that gives a negative ΔG°, which would imply the reaction is spontaneous, but I2 dissociating at high temperatures might actually have a positive ΔG°, but maybe not. Wait, but if ΔG° is negative, then Kp would be greater than 1. But looking at the options, all are less than 1, so maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the sign somewhere. Let me check again. The enthalpy change is positive because it's endothermic (requires energy to break the bond). So the bond dissociation energy is positive 148.7 kJ/mol. The entropy change is positive because 2 moles of gas from 1 (increasing disorder). So TΔS is positive. So ΔG° would be positive if TΔS is larger than ΔH.

Wait, in my calculation, ΔH is 148.7, TΔS is 156. So ΔG° = 148.7 - 156 = -7.3 kJ/mol. That would make ΔG° negative, leading to Kp being greater than 1. But looking at the options, all are less than 1, so maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use the bond dissociation energy in a different way. Alternatively, maybe the vibrational frequency information is needed for the entropy calculation. Oh! Because the vibrational contributions to entropy are considered, perhaps I should calculate the vibrational entropy change.

The vibrational entropy change comes from the heat capacity at constant volume, Cv, which for a diatomic molecule is (5/2)R for a rigid rotor, but including vibration, it's more complicated. Alternatively, the vibrational entropy can be calculated using the formula:

ΔS_vib = R (ln Q_vib_products - ln Q_vib_reactants )

Where Q_vib is the vibrational partition function.

For a diatomic molecule like I2, the vibrational partition function is approximately (hν)/(k_B T), but I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, the vibrational entropy is given by (hν/(2 k_B T)) ln(1/(1 - e^{-hν/(k_B T)} )).

But perhaps a simpler approximation is to use the formula for the vibrational entropy: S_vib = (hν/(2k_B T)) ln(1/(1 - e^{-hν/(k_B T)} )) ). But I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem gives the fundamental vibrational frequency as 214.4 cm^-1. Let me convert that to wavenumbers (cm^-1) to energy. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, speed of light c=3e10 cm/s, Boltzmann constant k_B=1.38e-23 J/K.

So energy per photon ν = h c ν̃ = 6.626e-34 * 3e10 * 214.4 ≈ 6.626e-34 * 3e10 = 1.9878e-23, multiplied by 214.4 gives approximately 4.26e-21 J per photon.

Wait, but for the vibrational entropy, perhaps I can calculate the vibrational contribution to the entropy.

The vibrational partition function Q_vib for a harmonic oscillator is (hν/(2k_B T)) * (1/(1 - e^{-hν/(k_B T)} )) ). The vibrational entropy is then S_vib = R ln Q_vib.

But wait, for the reaction I2 → 2I, each I atom has its own vibrational modes, but since I is an atom, it doesn't have vibrational modes. So the reactant (I2) has a vibrational mode, and the products (two I atoms) don't. So the vibrational entropy change would be the entropy of the products minus the entropy of the reactants. Since the products have no vibrational modes, their Q_vib is 1, so ln Q_vib(products) = 0. The reactant, I2, has a vibrational partition function.

So ΔS_vib = 0 - [R ln Q_vib(I2)] = - R ln Q_vib(I2).

Q_vib for I2 is (hν)/(2k_B T) * [1/(1 - e^{-hν/(k_B T)} )].

Let me compute hν/(k_B T):

hν = 6.626e-34 J·s * 214.4 cm^-1 * 3e10 cm/s = 6.626e-34 * 6.432e12 Hz = 4.26e-21 J.

k_B T = 1.38e-23 J/K * 1000 K = 1.38e-20 J.

So hν/(k_B T) = (4.26e-21) / (1.38e-20) ≈ 0.03087 ≈ 0.0309.

So Q_vib = (hν/(2k_B T)) * (1/(1 - e^{-hν/(k_B T)} )) ).

Compute each part:

hν/(2k_B T) = 0.0309 / 2 ≈ 0.01545.

e^{-0.0309} ≈ 0.9695.

So 1/(1 - 0.9695) = 1/0.0305 ≈ 32.787.

So Q_vib ≈ 0.01545 * 32.787 ≈ 0.505.

Then ln Q_vib ≈ ln(0.505) ≈ -0.683.

So ΔS_vib = - R * (-0.683) = R * 0.683 ≈ 8.314 * 0.683 ≈ 5.67 J/(mol·K) ≈ 0.00567 kJ/(mol·K).

Wait, but this is only the vibrational entropy change. The total entropy change would include this plus the translational and rotational contributions. But without knowing the rotational entropy change, perhaps I should focus on the overall approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the main contribution comes from the translational and rotational entropy, and the vibrational is a smaller term.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should approach this differently. Since the problem gives the dissociation energy, perhaps I can use the relation between the dissociation energy and the bond length to find the force constant, then calculate the vibrational entropy.

Wait, the dissociation energy D is given as 1.542 eV. The bond length r0 is 0.2667 nm = 0.2667e-9 m.

The force constant k can be found using D = (1/2) k r0². So k = (2D) / r0².

Let me compute that. D is 1.542 eV per molecule. I need to convert that to J. 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 1.542 eV = 1.542 * 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.468e-19 J.

So k = (2 * 2.468e-19 J) / (0.2667e-9 m)^2.

Compute denominator: (0.2667e-9)^2 = (0.2667)^2 * 1e-18 ≈ 0.0711 * 1e-18 = 7.11e-20 m².

So k = (4.936e-19 J) / (7.11e-20 m²) ≈ 4.936e-19 / 7.11e-20 ≈ 7.0 (approx 6.94).

Wait, 4.936e-19 / 7.11e-20 is approximately 6.94 N/m.

Now, the vibrational partition function Q_vib for I2 is (hν)/(2k_B T) * [1/(1 - e^{-hν/(k_B T)} )].

But I already calculated hν/(k_B T) earlier as approximately 0.0309. So Q_vib = 0.01545 * 32.787 ≈ 0.505 as before.

So the vibrational entropy change is ΔS_vib = R ln(Q_vib) ≈ 8.314 * (-0.683) ≈ -5.67 J/(mol·K). But since the products don't have vibrational modes, the change is -5.67 J/(mol·K).

Wait, but earlier I thought the change was negative, but now I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The reactant I2 has a vibrational mode, contributing Q_vib. The products (2I) have no vibrational modes, so their Q_vib is 1. So the change in vibrational entropy is ΔS_vib = S(products) - S(reactants) = 0 - R ln(Q_vib(I2)) = - R ln(Q_vib(I2)).

Wait, no, because S = R ln Q_vib + other terms, but for the reaction, the change in vibrational entropy is the sum of the product's vibrational entropy minus the reactant's. So it's (0) - (R ln Q_vib(I2)) ) = - R ln Q_vib(I2).

Which in this case, as Q_vib(I2) ≈ 0.505, ln(0.505) ≈ -0.683, so ΔS_vib = - R * (-0.683) = R * 0.683 ≈ 5.67 J/(mol·K) → 0.00567 kJ/(mol·K).

But wait, earlier I thought the vibrational entropy change was positive, but the calculation here suggests it's positive. Because the products have no vibration, the entropy goes down, so the change should be negative. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the vibrational entropy of the products is zero, and the reactant's is positive, so the change is negative.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it like this: S(products) - S(reactant) = 0 - S_vib(I2) = - S_vib(I2). So ΔS_vib = - S_vib(I2) = - [R ln Q_vib(I2)].

So if Q_vib(I2) is about 0.505, ln(0.505) is negative, so S_vib(I2) is negative. Thus, ΔS_vib = - (negative) = positive.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because I2 has a vibrational mode, which the products don't, so the entropy should decrease when I2 dissociates into atoms. So ΔS_vib should be negative.

I think I'm getting confused. Let me approach this differently. The vibrational entropy of I2 is S_vib(I2) = R ln Q_vib(I2) ≈ R * (-0.683) ≈ -5.67 J/(mol·K).

The products (2I) have no vibrational modes, so their vibrational entropy is zero. So the change in vibrational entropy is 0 - (-5.67) = +5.67 J/(mol·K). But that would mean an increase in entropy, which is correct because breaking a bond into two atoms would increase translational and rotational entropy. But wait, in reality, the vibrational entropy of I2 is positive, but when it dissociates, the products have no vibration, so the change would be negative.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the vibrational entropy of the reactant is positive, and the products have none. So the change is - S_vib(I2) = - [R ln Q_vib(I2)].

So if Q_vib(I2) is 0.505, ln(0.505) is -0.683, so S_vib(I2) = R*(-0.683) ≈ -5.67 J/(mol·K). Then the change is 0 - (-5.67) = +5.67 J/(mol·K). So the vibrational entropy change is positive.

But wait, that seems contradictory because the products have less vibrational entropy. Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me proceed.

So, combining all the entropy changes. The main entropy change comes from the translational and rotational contributions, which I approximated earlier using the formula 2 R ln2, which was about 11.5 J/(mol·K). Then the vibrational entropy change is about +5.67 J/(mol·K). So total ΔS° ≈ 11.5 + 5.67 ≈ 17.17 J/(mol·K) → 0.01717 kJ/(mol·K).

Wait, but earlier when using the standard molar entropy values, I got ΔS° ≈ 0.156 kJ/(mol·K), which is much larger. So I'm not sure which approach is correct. Maybe the standard molar entropy approach is better here because it uses known data.

But given the time I'm taking, perhaps I should proceed with the calculation using the ΔG° approach.

So, if I take ΔH° as 148.7 kJ/mol and ΔS° as 0.156 kJ/(mol·K), then:

ΔG° = 148.7 - (1000 * 0.156) = 148.7 - 156 = -7.3 kJ/mol.

Then, using ΔG° = -RT ln Kp.

R is 8.314 J/mol·K, T=1000 K.

So, -7300 J/mol = - (8.314 * 1000) * ln Kp.

Divide both sides by (-8314):

ln Kp = (-7300)/(-8314) ≈ 0.877.

Then Kp = e^0.877 ≈ 2.405.

Wait, but that's greater than 1, which doesn't match the options given, which are all less than 1. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider that the dissociation energy is given, and the process is endothermic, but the entropy change isn't as high as I thought.

Alternatively, perhaps the dissociation energy is in eV per molecule, so I should convert it correctly to kJ/mol.

Wait, 1 eV per molecule is 96.485 kJ/mol. So 1.542 eV per molecule is 1.542 * 96.485 ≈ 148.7 kJ/mol. But since it's per molecule, and for 1 mole, it's 148.7 kJ per mole of I2. So the bond energy per mole is 148.7 kJ.

So the enthalpy change for the reaction is 148.7 kJ/mol.

Now, if I consider that the entropy change is lower, perhaps around 0.0115 kJ/(mol·K) as calculated from the 2 R ln2 approach.

So ΔG° = 148.7 kJ - (1000 K * 0.0115 kJ/(K)) ) = 148.7 - 11.5 = 137.2 kJ/mol.

That's a positive ΔG°, which would give Kp < 1.

Wait, that makes more sense because the options are all less than 1.

So then, ΔG° = 137.2 kJ/mol = 137200 J/mol.

Using ΔG° = -RT ln Kp,

137200 = - (8.314 * 1000) * ln Kp.

So,

ln Kp = -137200 / (8314) ≈ -16.49.

So Kp ≈ e^(-16.49) ≈ 7.8e-8.

But that's way smaller than any of the options given. So I must have made a mistake in the entropy calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should include the vibrational entropy correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the standard Gibbs free energy of reaction as:

ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°.

But in this case, maybe the entropy change is calculated differently.

Another approach: the standard Gibbs free energy can be calculated using the formula involving the dissociation energy and the vibrational contribution.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation between the dissociation energy and the equilibrium constant.

Wait, I think I remember that the dissociation energy can be used to find the bond energy, which relates to the enthalpy change, and then the entropy change comes from the change in the number of moles of gas.

Let me try that.

The reaction is I2 → 2I.

The standard enthalpy change is ΔH° = 2 * bond energy of I-I in I2.

Given D = 1.542 eV per molecule, so per mole, it's 1.542 * Avogadro's number * eV → kJ.

Avogadro's number N_A ≈ 6.022e23 mol^-1.

1 eV = 96.485 kJ/mol, so D per mole is 1.542 * 96.485 ≈ 148.7 kJ/mol.

So ΔH° = 2 * (148.7 kJ/mol) ? Wait, no, because one mole of I2 has one mole of bonds. So for the reaction I2 → 2I, you break one mole of bonds, so ΔH° = 148.7 kJ/mol.

Now, the entropy change comes from the change in moles of gas. The reaction increases the moles from 1 to 2, so ΔS° = R ln(2) ≈ 8.314 * 0.693 ≈ 5.76 J/mol·K ≈ 0.00576 kJ/mol·K.

So ΔG° = 148.7 kJ - (1000 K * 0.00576 kJ/(K)) ) = 148.7 - 5.76 = 142.94 kJ/mol.

This gives ΔG° positive, so Kp < 1.

Then, ΔG° = -RT ln Kp → 142940 J/mol = - (8.314 * 1000) * ln Kp.

So ln Kp = -142940 / 8314 ≈ -17.19.

Thus, Kp ≈ e^-17.19 ≈ 1.3e-8, which is way smaller than the options.

Hmm, that's not matching any of the options. Maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the standard molar entropy of I2 and I are needed. Let me look up approximate values. I think S° for I2(g) is about 260 J/(mol·K), and for I(g) about 208 J/(mol·K).

So ΔS° = 2*208 - 260 = 416 - 260 = 156 J/(mol·K) → 0.156 kJ/(mol·K).

So ΔG° = 148.7 - (1000 * 0.156) = 148.7 - 156 = -7.3 kJ/mol.

Then, Kp = e^(-ΔG°/(RT)) = e^(7300 / (8.314 * 1000)).

Wait, wait, ΔG° is negative, so:

ΔG° = -7300 J/mol = -RT ln Kp → ln Kp = 7300/(8314) ≈ 0.877.

So Kp ≈ e^0.877 ≈ 2.405.

But the options don't have a value near 2.4; the highest option is H:3.142e-3, and others are smaller. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Perhaps I'm using the wrong sign for ΔG°.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify: ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°.

In this case, ΔH° is positive (endothermic), and ΔS° is positive (entropy increases). So if TΔS° is larger than ΔH°, ΔG° becomes negative, leading to Kp > 1. But the options given are all less than 1, so this suggests that ΔG° is positive, making Kp <1.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the sign of the entropy change.

Wait, no: for the reaction I2 → 2I, the moles of gas increase, so ΔS° should be positive. So ΔH° is positive (148.7 kJ), TΔS° is positive (156 kJ). So ΔG° = 148.7 -156 = -7.3 kJ.

Which gives Kp = e^(7300/(8314)) ≈ e^0.877 ≈ 2.4, but that's not among the options.

This suggests that perhaps the correct approach is to consider the dissociation energy differently, perhaps using the vibrational frequency to find the bond energy more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the bond energy using the vibrational frequency and the dissociation energy.

Wait, the dissociation energy is given as 1.542 eV. The vibrational frequency is 214.4 cm^-1.

The bond energy can be estimated using the Morse potential formula, where D = (h c ν̃)^2 / (4 k), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the bond energy is approximately (h c ν̃)^2 / (4 D), but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, I can use the relation between the dissociation energy and the vibrational frequency. The dissociation energy D is related to the force constant k and the bond length r0 as D = (1/2) k r0².

The force constant k can be found from the vibrational frequency using k = (m_e) (4π² ν̃²) (c^2), where m_e is the reduced mass.

Wait, the formula for the vibrational frequency ν̃ is:

ν̃ = (1/(2πc)) * sqrt(k/μ),

where μ is the reduced mass.

So rearranging, k = (2πc ν̃)^2 * μ.

The reduced mass μ for I2 is (m_I * m_I)/(m_I + m_I) = m_I /2.

The atomic weight of I is about 126.9 g/mol, so m_I = (126.9e-3 kg/mol) / (Avogadro's number) ≈ (0.1269 kg/mol) / 6.022e23 mol^-1 ≈ 2.107e-25 kg.

So μ = (2.107e-25 kg) / 2 ≈ 1.0535e-25 kg.

Now, compute k:

k = (2π * c * ν̃ )² * μ.

c is speed of light, 3e10 cm/s = 3e8 m/s.

ν̃ is 214.4 cm^-1 = 214.4 1/cm = 214.4 * 1e2 m^-1 = 2.144e2 m^-1.

So:

k = (2π * 3e8 m/s * 2.144e2 m^-1 )² * 1.0535e-25 kg.

Compute inside the square first:

2π *3e8 * 2.144e2 = 2 * 3.1416 * 3e8 * 2.144e2 ≈ 6.2832 * 3e8 * 2.144e2.

6.2832 * 3e8 = 1.885e9.

1.885e9 * 2.144e2 ≈ 1.885e9 * 2.144e2 = 1.885 * 2.144e11 ≈ 4.03e11.

So square of that is (4.03e11)^2 = 1.624e23.

Now multiply by μ = 1.0535e-25 kg:

k = 1.624e23 * 1.0535e-25 ≈ 1.711e-2 N/m.

Wait, that seems very small. But I think I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute:

ν̃ = 214.4 cm^-1 = 214.4 / (3e10 cm/s) = 214.4 / 3e10 Hz ≈ 7.146e-9 Hz.

Wait, no, ν̃ in cm^-1 is ν̃ = c * ν, where ν is frequency in Hz. So ν = ν̃ / c.

Wait, I think I messed up the units earlier.

Let me correct the approach.

The vibrational frequency in wavenumbers (cm^-1) is given by:

ν̃ (cm^-1) = (1/(2πc)) * sqrt(k/μ),

so solving for k:

k = (2πc ν̃ )² * μ.

c is in cm/s, which is 3e10 cm/s.

ν̃ is 214.4 cm^-1.

So compute 2πc ν̃:

2π * 3e10 cm/s * 214.4 cm^-1 = 6.2832 * 3e10 * 214.4 ≈ 6.2832 * 3e10 * 2.144e2 ≈ 6.2832 * 3e10 * 2.144e2.

Compute 3e10 * 2.144e2 = 3 * 2.144e12 = 6.432e12.

Multiply by 6.2832: 6.2832 * 6.432e12 ≈ 4.03e13.

Now square that: (4.03e13)^2 = 1.624e27.

Multiply by μ = 1.0535e-25 kg:

k ≈ 1.624e27 * 1.0535e-25 = 1.624 * 1.0535e2 ≈ 1.712e2 N/m = 171.2 N/m.

That's more reasonable. Now, using the bond energy formula D = (1/2) k r0².

r0 is 0.2667 nm = 0.2667e-9 m.

So D = 0.5 * 171.2 N/m * (0.2667e-9 m)^2.

Compute (0.2667e-9)^2 = (0.2667)^2 * 1e-18 = 0.0711 * 1e-18 = 7.11e-20 m².

So D = 0.5 * 171.2 * 7.11e-20 ≈ 0.5 * 171.2 * 7.11e-20 ≈ 85.6 * 7.11e-20 ≈ 6.08e-18 J.

Convert D to eV: 6.08e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 37.95 eV per molecule.

Wait, that's way higher than the given dissociation energy of 1.542 eV. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units for μ. Let me recheck.

The reduced mass μ for I2 is:

μ = (m_I * m_I) / (m_I + m_I) = m_I / 2.

m_I is the mass of one iodine atom. The molar mass of I is 126.9 g/mol, so molar mass M = 0.1269 kg/mol.

So m_I = M / (N_A) = 0.1269 kg/mol / 6.022e23 mol^-1 ≈ 2.107e-25 kg.

So μ = 2.107e-25 kg / 2 ≈ 1.0535e-25 kg.

Wait, earlier I used 1e-25 kg, but it's actually 1.0535e-25 kg.

So let me recalculate k:

k = (2πc ν̃ )² * μ.

ν̃ = 214.4 cm^-1.

c = 3e10 cm/s.

So 2πc ν̃ = 2 * π * 3e10 * 214.4 ≈ 6.2832 * 3e10 * 214.4.

3e10 * 214.4 = 6.432e12.

6.2832 * 6.432e12 ≈ 4.03e13.

Square that: (4.03e13)^2 = 1.624e27.

Multiply by μ = 1.0535e-25 kg: 1.624e27 * 1.0535e-25 ≈ 1.624 * 1.0535e2 ≈ 1.712e2 N/m.

So k ≈ 171.2 N/m.

Now, D = (1/2) k r0².

r0 = 0.2667 nm = 0.2667e-9 m.

r0² = (0.2667e-9)^2 = 7.11e-20 m².

So D = 0.5 * 171.2 * 7.11e-20 ≈ 0.5 * 171.2 ≈ 85.6 * 7.11e-20 ≈ 6.08e-18 J.

Convert to eV: 6.08e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 37.95 eV/molecule.

But the given dissociation energy is 1.542 eV per molecule. So something's wrong here. Maybe the approach using the vibrational frequency to find k is incorrect, or perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that the dissociation energy is given and use it directly.

Given that, maybe I should proceed with the calculation using the standard approach of ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°, where ΔH° is the dissociation energy converted into kJ/mol, and ΔS° is R ln(2) * 2.

But I'm stuck because when I use the given dissociation energy, I get a Kp around 2.4, which isn't among the options. Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider the spin multiplicity or other factors.

Wait, the problem mentions that the ground state of I is a doublet with a separation of 7603 cm^-1. I'm not sure how that affects the calculation. Maybe it's the energy difference between the two states, but I don't see how that ties into the equilibrium constant calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the vibrational entropy is the main factor and the translational is negligible. Or maybe I should use the formula for the partition function of the reaction.

Another approach is to use the relation:

ln Kp = (ΔS°/R) - (ΔH°)/(R T).

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula involving the dissociation energy and the vibrational temperature.

The vibrational temperature θ_vib = h ν̃ / k_B.

Compute θ_vib = h * ν̃ / k_B.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

ν̃ = 214.4 cm^-1 = 214.4 * 1e2 m^-1 = 2.144e2 m^-1.

c = 3e8 m/s, so ν = c * ν̃ = 3e8 m/s * 2.144e2 m^-1 = 6.432e10 Hz.

So θ_vib = h ν / k_B = 6.626e-34 J·s * 6.432e10 Hz / 1.38e-23 J/K.

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 6.432e10 ≈ 4.26e-23 J.

θ_vib = 4.26e-23 / 1.38e-23 ≈ 3.09 K.

So θ_vib is about 3.09 K.

At T=1000 K, which is much higher than θ_vib, so the vibrational contribution to entropy is significant.

The vibrational contribution to the entropy can be approximated by S_vib = (h ν̃)/(2 k_B T) * ln(1/(1 - e^{-h ν̃/(k_B T)} )).

But earlier I calculated that as about 5.67 J/(mol·K), which is 0.00567 kJ/(mol·K).

So adding this to the translational entropy change of 11.5 J/(mol·K), the total ΔS° ≈ 17.17 J/(mol·K) → 0.01717 kJ/(mol·K).

Then ΔG° = 148.7 kJ - (1000 * 0.01717) → 148.7 - 17.17 ≈ 131.53 kJ/mol.

This gives ΔG° = 131530 J/mol.

Then, ΔG° = -RT ln Kp → 131530 = -8.314 * 1000 * ln Kp.

ln Kp = -131530 / 8314 ≈ -15.81.

Kp ≈ e^-15.81 ≈ 1.7e-7, which is still way below the options.

I'm clearly missing something here. Perhaps the correct approach is to use the relation between the equilibrium constant and the bond strength, considering the vibrational energy levels.

Alternatively, perhaps the given separation of 7603 cm^-1 is the energy difference between the two states of I, which would contribute to the entropy.

Wait, the problem states that the separation is 7603 cm^-1, which is a large value. Maybe this is the energy difference between the two electronic states of I, contributing to the Gibbs free energy.

But I'm not sure how to incorporate that into the calculation. Perhaps it's beyond the scope of the given problem.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps I should look for an alternative approach. Maybe the question expects me to use the dissociation energy directly and the entropy change from the increase in moles of gas.

So, ΔH° = 148.7 kJ/mol.

ΔS° = R ln(2) per mole, so for 1 mole of I2 producing 2 moles of I, it's 1 mole * ln(2) → ΔS° = R ln2 ≈ 5.76 J/(mol·K) → 0.00576 kJ/(mol·K).

So ΔG° = 148.7 - (1000 * 0.00576) = 148.7 - 5.76 ≈ 142.94 kJ/mol.

Then, using ΔG° = -RT ln Kp → 142940 J/mol = -8314 * ln Kp → ln Kp ≈ -17.19 → Kp ≈ 1.3e-8. Not matching options.

Wait, maybe I should include the vibrational entropy as a negative contribution because the products have no vibrational modes. Earlier, I calculated the vibrational entropy change as about +5.67 J/(mol·K), but if the products have no vibrational modes, the entropy change should be negative because the reactant has that vibrational entropy.

So, ΔS° = 5.76 (translational) + (-5.67) (vibrational) ≈ 0.09 J/(mol·K) → 0.00009 kJ/(mol·K).

Wait, that would make ΔS° ≈ 0.00009 kJ/(mol·K), which is negligible. Then ΔG° ≈ 148.7 kJ, leading to Kp ≈ 1.3e-8, which is still too small.

Alternatively, perhaps the vibrational entropy change is negative.

So, ΔS° = 5.76 (translational) - 5.67 (vibrational) ≈ 0.09 J/(mol·K) → 0.00009 kJ/(mol·K).

So ΔG° = 148.7 - (1000 * 0.00009) ≈ 148.6 kJ.

Then, Kp ≈ e^(-148600/(8314)) ≈ e^-17.88 ≈ 1.6e-8. Still too small.

I'm not making progress here. Perhaps I should look for another approach. Maybe I should use the formula for the equilibrium constant involving the dissociation energy and the vibrational partition function.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the relation between the dissociation energy and the bond length with the given vibrational frequency to find the equilibrium constant.

But I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent, I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options. The options are all in the range of 1e-3 to 3e-3. Given that, perhaps the correct Kp is around 1e-3.

Looking back, when I used the standard molar entropy approach, I got Kp ≈ 2.4, but that's not in the options. So perhaps the correct approach leads to a Kp around 1e-3.

Looking at the options, option F is 1.079e-3, which is close to 1e-3. Alternatively, option I is 1.571e-3, option E is 1.456e-3. Without a clear calculation path, I'll have to choose based on the options and the likely correct answer.

To calculate the equilibrium constant \( K_p \) for the reaction \( \text{I}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{I} \) at 1000 K, the key steps involve determining the Gibbs free energy change (\( \Delta G^\circ \)) using the enthalpy change (\( \Delta H^\circ \)) and entropy change (\( \Delta S^\circ \)) of the reaction. The dissociation energy of \( \text{I}_2 \) is given as 1.542 eV, which is converted to \( \Delta H^\circ = 148.7 \, \text{kJ/mol} \). The entropy change is approximated using the increase in moles of gas, yielding \( \Delta S^\circ = R \ln(2) \approx 5.76 \, \text{J/mol·K} \), or \( 0.00576 \, \text{kJ/mol·K} \).

Using the Gibbs free energy equation:

\[
\Delta G^\circ = \Delta H^\circ - T \Delta S^\circ
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta G^\circ = 148.7 \, \text{kJ/mol} - (1000 \, \text{K} \times 0.00576 \, \text{kJ/mol·K}) = 148.7 - 5.76 = 142.94 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
\]

The equilibrium constant is related to \( \Delta G^\circ \) by:

\[
\Delta G^\circ = -RT \ln K_p
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\ln K_p = -\frac{\Delta G^\circ}{RT}
\]

Substituting \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K} \), \( T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), and \( \Delta G^\circ = 142940 \, \text{J/mol} \):

\[
\ln K_p = -\frac{142940}{8314} \approx -17.19
\]

Exponentiating:

\[
K_p = e^{-17.19} \approx 1.3 \times 10^{-8}.
\]

This result is much smaller than the provided options, suggesting a potential error in the entropy calculation or the interpretation of the dissociation energy. Given the options, the closest plausible value based on the reasoning is approximately \( 1.079 \times 10^{-3} \), corresponding to option F.
