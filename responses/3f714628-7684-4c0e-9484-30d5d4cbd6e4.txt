Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about personnel selection, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read through the question and the options carefully.

The question is asking when it's appropriate to ask a person's age during personnel selection. The options are labeled A through G, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I remember that in employment settings, there are laws like the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) in the US, which protects individuals from being discriminated against because of their age. So, generally, you can't ask someone's age unless it's for a legitimate reason.

Looking at the options:

A: Standardized test results show the incumbent does not have all the aptitudes expected for the job. Hmm, does that justify asking age? I don't think so. Tests should assess skills, not age-related factors.

B: Age is a bona fide occupational requirement. I think that's a legal term. A bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR) means the job actually requires someone of a certain age. Like maybe a role where you need a minor, or someone under a certain age for legal reasons. So this could be a valid reason.

C: Tests suggest the person won't perform well. Again, tests should measure ability, not age. So even if tests are failing, age isn't a valid reason to ask unless it's a BFOR.

D: Interviewer is curious. That's definitely not a valid reason. It's discriminatory to ask just out of curiosity.

E: For company demographics. I'm not sure about this. Collecting demographic data is sometimes done for affirmative action or diversity purposes, but I think you can collect it post-offer or after hiring. Asking during selection might be problematic unless it's for a specific legal purpose.

F: Nearing typical retirement age. That might be a reason, but I'm not sure if it's allowed. It could be a form of age discrimination if the company is trying to phase someone out.

G: Company policy to hire only a certain age group. That sounds like age discrimination and probably illegal unless it's a BFOR.

So the only option that seems valid is B, where age is a bona fide occupational requirement. That would be a rare case, like needing a child for a job, or someone over a certain age for a role where older individuals are legally required (though I can't think of many examples, it's the only option that fits the exception).

The correct answer is when age is a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR), as this is a legal exception allowing age to be considered in employment decisions.

Answer: B
