Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Is it not unity alone that can weld us into an effective force, capable of creating our own progress and making our valuable contribution to world peace? Which independent African state will claim that its financial structure and banking institutions are fully harnessed to its national development? Which will claim that its material resources and human energies are available for its own national aspirations? We are fast learning that political independence is not enough to rid us of the consequences of colonial rule. We have been too busy nursing our separate states to understand fully the basic need for union, rooted in common purpose, common planning and common endeavour.

Okay, so I've got this question here about a speech by Kwame Nkrumah, the Ghanaian president, from 1963. He's talking about the Organization of African Unity, right? The passage seems to be about how political independence alone isn't enough for African countries. He's emphasizing the need for unity, common purpose, planning, and efforts. He's saying that even though they're independent, they're still dealing with the aftermath of colonialism, and maybe they're too focused on their own separate states to see the bigger picture of union.

The question is asking which factor was most important in preventing the fulfillment of the political dreams described in the passage. The options are A through D.

Let me break this down. The passage is talking about the need for unity among African states to achieve progress and contribute to world peace. Nkrumah is pointing out that having political independence isn't sufficient because the financial, material, and human resources aren't fully harnessed for national development. So, the problem is that despite being independent, they're not unified enough, which is holding them back.

Looking at the options:

A: Lack of common ethnicity, language, or religion. Well, Africa is a continent with many diverse ethnic groups, languages, and religions. But the passage isn't specifically pointing to that as the issue. It's more about political unity and harnessing resources, not about cultural homogeneity.

B: Spread of communism. The Cold War was happening, and communism was a factor, but the passage doesn't mention ideological conflicts as the main issue. It's more about the need for unity against the consequences of colonialism.

C: Armed intervention by Cold War superpowers. This seems plausible. During the Cold War, superpowers like the US and Soviet Union often supported or intervened in African countries to gain influence, which could have disrupted unity. Proxy wars and support for different factions might have prevented African countries from uniting because they were too focused on conflicts supported by external powers.

D: Africa's shortage of natural resources. But many African countries are rich in natural resources. The issue isn't a lack of resources; it's about how those resources are used and whether they're directed towards national development. The passage talks about harnessing resources, not a shortage.

So, the problem is that unity isn't achieved, and that's preventing progress. Why? Because external powers were intervening, causing divisions and conflicts. That's probably option C. It's about how the Cold War's armed interventions by superpowers prevented African countries from uniting and focusing on their common goals.

Therefore, the answer is C.

The passage emphasizes the importance of unity among African states to overcome the challenges of colonialism and achieve progress. Nkrumah highlights that political independence alone is insufficient and that the lack of common purpose and planning hinders development. The key issue is the failure to unite, which is influenced by external factors.

Option C, the armed intervention by Cold War superpowers, is the most relevant factor. These interventions disrupted unity by creating divisions and conflicts, preventing African countries from focusing on their common goals. This aligns with the passage's focus on the consequences of external interference.

Answer: C
