What percentage of the applicants considered have scores below 740? (Assume the scores are normally distributed.)

Options:

A: 75%
B: 86.7%
C: 50%
D: 80%
E: 13.3%
F: 60.5%
G: 90%
H: 67.2%
I: 82.9%
J: 17.1%

Okay, so I have this statistics problem about LSAT scores. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The problem says the mean LSAT score is 650, and the standard deviation is 45. They're considering only applicants with scores above 700. The question is asking what percentage of these considered applicants have scores below 740. And we're told to assume the scores are normally distributed.

First, I think I need to visualize this. Normally, in a normal distribution, the mean is in the center. So 650 is the average. The standard deviation is 45, which means most scores fall within 650 plus or minus 45. But here, we're only looking at scores above 700. So I imagine cutting off the distribution at 700 and looking at everything to the right of that.

Wait, no, actually, the problem says applicants with scores above 700 are considered. So the pool we're looking at is all scores above 700. Now, within this group, we need to find how many have scores below 740.

Hmm, so it's like taking a slice of the normal distribution from 700 upwards and then finding what proportion of that slice is below 740. That would be the area from 700 to 740 relative to the area from 700 onwards.

I think the first step is to convert these scores into Z-scores because that will let me use the standard normal distribution table or Z-table. The Z-score formula is (X - μ)/σ, where X is the score, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.

So, let's compute the Z-scores for 700 and 740.

For 700:
Z = (700 - 650) / 45 = 50 / 45 ≈ 1.1111

For 740:
Z = (740 - 650) / 45 = 90 / 45 = 2

Wait, that's correct? 740 minus 650 is 90, divided by 45 is 2. Yeah, that makes sense. So 700 is about 1.11 standard deviations above the mean, and 740 is exactly 2 standard deviations above.

Now, since we're dealing with the area above 700, let's find the probability that a score is above 700. Using the Z-table, the area to the left of Z=1.11 is about 0.8665. Wait, no, wait. No, wait, the Z-table gives the area to the left of the Z-score. So for Z=1.11, the cumulative probability up to 1.11 is approximately 0.8665. That means about 86.65% of the scores are below 700. So the area above 700 is 1 - 0.8665 = 0.1335, or 13.35%.

Wait, but our problem is about the percentage of applicants considered (i.e., those above 700) who have scores below 740. So we need the area between 700 and 740 divided by the area above 700.

So, first, find the area between 700 and 740. The Z-scores are 1.11 and 2.00.

Looking up Z=1.11 in the Z-table, the area to the left is about 0.8665. For Z=2.00, the area is about 0.9772. So the area between 1.11 and 2.00 is 0.9772 - 0.8665 = 0.1107, or 11.07%.

So the area above 700 is 0.1335, as calculated earlier. Therefore, the proportion of applicants above 700 who are below 740 is 0.1107 / 0.1335.

Let me compute that. 0.1107 divided by 0.1335. Let's see:

0.1107 / 0.1335 ≈ 0.829, which is about 82.9%.

Wait, but let me check the exact Z-values to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I should use more precise Z-table values or use a calculator for the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps using the standard normal distribution function, where Φ(z) is the cumulative distribution function. So Φ(1.11) is approximately 0.8665, and Φ(2) is 0.9772.

The area from 700 to 740 is Φ(2) - Φ(1.11) = 0.9772 - 0.8665 = 0.1107.

The area above 700 is 1 - Φ(1.11) = 1 - 0.8665 = 0.1335.

So the ratio is 0.1107 / 0.1335 ≈ 0.829, or 82.9%.

Looking at the options, option I is 82.9%, so that's probably the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Computing Z-scores:

700: (700-650)/45 = 50/45 ≈ 1.1111

740: (740-650)/45 = 90/45 = 2.00.

So Z=1.1111 is approximately 1.11, so Φ(1.11) is about 0.8665.

Φ(2.00) is 0.9772.

Area between 700 and 740: 0.9772 - 0.8665 = 0.1107.

Area above 700: 1 - 0.8665 = 0.1335.

So 0.1107 / 0.1335 = 0.829, which is 82.9%, so option I.

The problem involves determining the percentage of LSAT scores above 700 that are below 740, assuming a normal distribution with a mean of 650 and a standard deviation of 45. 

1. **Convert Scores to Z-scores**:  
   - For 700: \( Z = \frac{700 - 650}{45} \approx 1.11 \)  
   - For 740: \( Z = \frac{740 - 650}{45} = 2.00 \)  

2. **Find Areas Using Z-table**:  
   - Area to the left of \( Z = 1.11 \) is approximately 0.8665.  
   - Area to the left of \( Z = 2.00 \) is approximately 0.9772.  

3. **Calculate Area Between 700 and 740**:  
   - Area between \( Z = 1.11 \) and \( Z = 2.00 \): \( 0.9772 - 0.8665 = 0.1107 \).  

4. **Calculate Area Above 700**:  
   - Area above 700: \( 1 - 0.8665 = 0.1335 \).  

5. **Determine Proportion**:  
   - Proportion of scores between 700 and 740 relative to scores above 700: \( \frac{0.1107}{0.1335} \approx 0.829 \), or 82.9%.  

Thus, the percentage of applicants considered (scores above 700) with scores below 740 is approximately **82.9%**.
