Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about Cicero's arguments. The question is asking what Cicero says we should follow to never go morally astray. The options are A through J, each suggesting a different guide.

First, I remember that Cicero was a Roman philosopher and statesman, and he's known for his contributions to ethics and moral philosophy. I think he was a Stoic, so his ideas probably align with Stoic philosophy. Stoicism emphasizes living in harmony with nature, particularly with the natural order, which they called the "cosmic reason" or something like that.

Looking at the options, option D says "follow Nature as our guide." That sounds familiar in the context of Stoicism. I think Cicero talked about the concept of "lex naturae," which translates to the law of nature. He believed that following nature would lead people to act morally and justly.

Let me go through the other options to make sure I'm not missing something. Option A is religious edicts, but I don't recall Cicero focusing on religion as the main guide for morality. He was more about reason and nature. Option B is historical precedents; that seems more like something a historian or a legalist might say, not a philosopher like Cicero. Option C is teachings of philosophers. While he did study them, I think he went beyond that to nature itself. Option E is conscience, but I'm not sure if Cicero placed that as the primary guide. He might have seen it differently. Option F is laws, which could be part of it, but again, the primary guide was nature. Option G is personal desires, which Stoicism advises against because desires can lead to vice. Option H is instincts; not sure, but seems less likely. Option I is societal norms, which might be part of it but not the primary guide. Option J is friends and family, which is important but not the main point for Cicero's moral guidance.

So putting it all together, the best fit is option D: follow Nature as our guide. That aligns with his Stoic beliefs and the idea of the law of nature guiding moral actions.

The answer is D: follow Nature as our guide. Cicero, as a Stoic philosopher, emphasized the importance of aligning with the natural order, or "lex naturae," as the foundation for moral guidance.

Answer: D
