Question:

According to usual practice, a long-time regular customer left her car at an auto mechanic's shop with written instructions to "check and tune up the engine; make sure the brakes are good and working; examine the tires; also, check and repair all major systems because I am driving cross country next week." She did not see the mechanic or discuss with him the price or other details. When she picked up the car, there was a bill for $5,000 on the dash board. All of the services and parts were workmanlike, not defective and pertained to the areas in the instructions. She refused to pay, claiming that there was no agreement and that the mechanic should have called for advance approval. Can she be held responsible for contractual services performed?

Options:

A: No, because there is always an implication that the provider must get permission before doing work not approved.
B: No, because there was no written agreement specifying the cost of the services.
C: Yes, because she left written instructions, which can be considered a contract.
D: Yes, because she had a history of leaving her car for service without discussing price or details.
E: Yes, because the circumstances, including prior practice, showed intent to contract and a meeting of the minds.
F: No, because a contract cannot be based on implications and guess work.
G: Yes, because the circumstances and past practice established an implied-in-law contract based on mutual assent.
H: No, because the mechanic did not provide an estimate before performing the services.
I: No, because she did not explicitly agree to the price of the services.
J: Yes, because the quality of the work was satisfactory and pertained to the areas in the instructions.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this contract law question. Let me break it down step by step. 

The scenario is about a customer who left her car at an auto mechanic's shop with specific instructions. She wrote down that the mechanic should check and tune up the engine, make sure the brakes are good, examine the tires, and check and repair all major systems because she's driving cross country next week. She didn't talk to the mechanic or discuss the price or other details. When she came back, there was a $5,000 bill. The services and parts were all workmanlike, not defective, and relevant to her instructions. She refused to pay, saying there was no agreement and that the mechanic should have called for approval. The question is whether she can be held responsible for the services.

So, the issue here is whether a contract was formed between the customer and the mechanic. I remember that for a contract to be valid, there needs to be an offer, acceptance, consideration, and mutual assent (also known as a meeting of the minds). 

The customer gave written instructions, which could be seen as an offer. The mechanic performed the services as per those instructions, which might be acceptance. But wait, did the mechanic explicitly accept the offer? Or is this more about implied terms? 

She didn't discuss the price or details, which is important. Usually, in such situations, if there's a prior course of dealing, it might imply certain terms. They were long-time regular customers, so maybe past practices can establish what terms are expected. In contract law, prior dealings can help imply terms if the parties have a history of behaving in a certain way.

Looking at the options, let's go through each one. 

Option A says no because the provider must get permission. But I don't think that's necessarily the case unless there's an implied term from prior dealings that the mechanic needs approval. The customer didn't specify that, so maybe A is not correct.

Option B says no because there's no written agreement on cost. But a contract doesn't need to be written; it can be oral. Plus, the instructions were written, so maybe B isn't the right reason.

Option C says yes because written instructions are a contract. That seems plausible, but I'm not sure if just the instructions alone are enough without some acceptance or consideration.

Option D says yes because she had a history of leaving cars without discussing details. This could imply that they have a routine where the mechanic does what's needed without prior price discussion. That seems relevant because prior practice could show mutual assent to the terms.

Option E says yes because circumstances and prior practice showed intent to contract. This aligns with D, focusing on the mutual intent based on history.

Option F says no because contracts can't be based on implications. But I think prior dealings can create implied terms, so F might not be correct.

Option G says yes because circumstances and past practice established an implied-in-law contract. Wait, implied-in-law is different from implied in fact. Implied-in-law is like a quasi-contract, which is more about fairness when there's no express contract but one party has a duty to prevent unjust enrichment. Here, the mechanic did the work, so the customer might be liable under a quasi-contract theory, regardless of prior dealings. Or maybe it's implied in fact because of prior dealings.

Option H says no because no estimate was provided. But the mechanic wasn't required to give an estimate unless it's part of their usual practice. If it's usual for them to do work without prior approval, then maybe H isn't the issue.

Option I says no because she didn't agree to the price. But in some cases, price can be implied based on the work done, especially if it's customary. So I'm not sure about I.

Option J says yes because the quality was good and relevant. That seems more about the duty to pay for services rendered, which ties into quasi-contract or implied contracts.

So, putting it together: the key factors are the written instructions and prior practice. The customer didn't explicitly agree to the price, but they've been dealing regularly, so the mechanic might have relied on that history. In contract terms, mutual assent can be inferred from prior dealings and the written instructions.

Looking at the options, E and G seem relevant. E says yes because circumstances and prior practice showed intent to contract. G mentions implied-in-law based on mutual assent. But I'm a bit confused between E and G. 

Wait, the question is about whether she can be held responsible. Under contract law, if there's a prior course of dealing, the parties can be bound by implied terms. So the mechanic's performance based on her instructions, combined with their history, likely forms a contract. Therefore, the answer would be E because it's about mutual intent and meeting of minds based on prior practice.

Alternatively, G talks about implied-in-law, which is a quasi-contract. But I think E is more about implied in fact, which is a real contract based on mutual agreement inferred from their dealings. So I think E is correct.

The scenario involves determining whether a contract was formed between the customer and the mechanic based on the written instructions and prior dealings. For a contract to exist, there must be mutual assent, which can be inferred from the customer's instructions and the mechanic's performance, especially given their history of regular business. The prior practice supports the idea that the mechanic would act on the instructions without needing explicit price discussions. Therefore, the circumstances and prior practice show the intent to form a contract through mutual agreement.

Answer: E
