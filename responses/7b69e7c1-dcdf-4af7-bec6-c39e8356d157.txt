Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this least-squares regression question with regularization. The question is about how increasing the regularization parameter λ affects the testing error. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that in linear regression, we often use least-squares to find the best fit line. But when we add regularization, like in ridge regression, we're adding a penalty term to the cost function. The parameter λ controls the strength of this regularization.

So, when λ is increased, the model becomes more regularized. This usually means that the coefficients of the model are shrunk towards zero. The idea is to prevent overfitting by making the model simpler, right? So, a higher λ should reduce overfitting because the model doesn't adjust as much to the training data.

Now, overfitting is when the model performs well on training data but poorly on testing data. So, if we reduce overfitting by increasing λ, the model should generalize better. That would mean the testing error, which measures performance on unseen data, should decrease. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Because sometimes too much regularization can lead to underfitting, where the model is too simple and doesn't capture the underlying pattern in the data. So, maybe there's a sweet spot for λ where the testing error is minimized.

Let me think about the bias-variance tradeoff. Regularization increases bias but decreases variance. So, higher λ increases bias, making the model less sensitive to the training data, which could either help or hurt depending on the situation. If the model is overfitting, increasing λ would reduce testing error. But if the model is already underfitted, increasing λ might make it even worse, thus increasing testing error.

Wait, but the question says "assuming that the optimisation can be done exactly." So, we don't have to worry about approximation errors in the optimization process. That probably means that as λ increases, the model's complexity decreases in a predictable way.

I'm a bit confused. Let's think of it in terms of training and testing errors. With higher λ, the training error might increase because the model is less complex and can't fit the training data as well. But the testing error could decrease because the model is less overfitted. However, if we go too far and λ is too high, the training error might start increasing a lot, and perhaps the testing error could also increase if the model is underfitting.

So, the relationship between λ and testing error isn't strictly increasing or decreasing. It depends on the model's capacity and the data. At first, increasing λ might lower the testing error by reducing overfitting, but beyond a certain point, it could start increasing the testing error because the model is too simple to capture the underlying pattern.

Looking at the options:

A: No effect on testing error. Unlikely because λ changes model complexity.

B: Always increases testing error. Doesn't seem right because higher λ can reduce overfitting.

C: May decrease or increase testing error. This seems possible because it depends on the situation.

D: Never increases training error. No, higher λ usually makes the model less complex, so training error should increase because it can't fit as well.

E: Always decreases testing error. Not necessarily, as too much regularization can cause underfitting.

F: May decrease or increase training error. Well, higher λ should increase training error because the model is less complex, so it's less able to fit the training data.

G: No effect on training error. Unlikely because higher λ changes model fit.

H: Never decreases testing error. No, because higher λ can reduce overfitting and thus testing error.

I: Never decreases training error. No, because higher λ makes the model less complex, so training error increases.

J: Never increases. No, because higher λ can cause training error to increase.

So, the correct answer is C: may decrease or increase the testing error. Because depending on the level of λ, it could have either effect on testing error. Too low λ might lead to high testing error due to overfitting, and higher λ reduces that. But if λ is too high, it might cause underfitting, thus increasing testing error again. So, the testing error might first decrease and then increase as λ increases, creating a U-shaped curve.

When performing least-squares regression with regularization, increasing the regularization parameter λ affects the model's complexity. Higher λ reduces overfitting by shrinking the coefficients, which can decrease testing error by improving generalization. However, if λ is too large, it can lead to underfitting, increasing testing error as the model becomes too simple to capture the underlying pattern. Therefore, the effect of increasing λ on testing error depends on the balance between overfitting and underfitting, making it possible for testing error to either decrease or increase.
