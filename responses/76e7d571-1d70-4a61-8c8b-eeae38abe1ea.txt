Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: A system consisting of 82.5 grams of liquid water at 300 K is heated using an immersion heater at a constant pressure of 1.00 bar. If a current of 1.75 A passes through a 25.0-ohm resistor for 100 seconds, what is the final temperature of the water?

The options are from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one. Alright, let's break this down.

First, I remember that when electrical energy is used to heat something, the heat (Q) generated can be calculated using the formula Q = I² * R * t. Oh right, because power P is I²R, and since power is energy per time, Q is P multiplied by time t. So yeah, Q equals I squared times R times t.

So let me jot that down: Q = I² * R * t.

I know the current I is 1.75 A, the resistance R is 25.0 ohms, and the time t is 100 seconds. Let me plug those numbers in.

Calculating I squared: 1.75 A squared is (1.75)^2, which is 3.0625. Then multiply by R, which is 25. So 3.0625 * 25 = 76.5625. Then multiply by time t, which is 100 seconds. So 76.5625 * 100 equals 7656.25 Joules. So Q is 7656.25 J.

But wait, that's the heat energy provided to the water. Now I need to relate that to the temperature change of the water. For that, I think the formula Q = m * c * ΔT would be useful, where m is mass, c is specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

I remember that the specific heat capacity of water is about 4.184 J/(g·K). Let me confirm that—it's usually around there. So c = 4.184 J/(g·K). The mass m is given as 82.5 grams.

So rearranging the formula to solve for ΔT, we get ΔT = Q / (m * c). Plugging in the numbers: ΔT = 7656.25 J / (82.5 g * 4.184 J/(g·K)).

Let me compute the denominator first. 82.5 * 4.184. Let me calculate that. 80 *4.184 is 334.72, and 2.5 *4.184 is 10.46. Adding those together gives 334.72 + 10.46 = 345.18 J/K. So the denominator is 345.18 J/K.

Now the numerator is 7656.25 J. So ΔT = 7656.25 / 345.18 ≈ let's see. Hmm, 345.18 times 22 is approximately 7600 (because 345*22=7590). So 7656.25 is about 22.2 K. Let me do the exact division: 7656.25 ÷ 345.18 ≈ 22.2 K.

So the temperature change is about 22.2 K. The initial temperature was 300 K, so the final temperature should be 300 + 22.2 = 322.2 K. Hmm, looking at the options, option A is 322 K. That seems to fit.

Wait, but wait a second. Is there any assumption here that I might have missed? Like, does the water boil? Because at 1.00 bar pressure, the boiling point of water is 100°C, which is 373 K. Oh, but the initial temperature is 300 K, and the temperature increase is only about 22 K, so it goes up to 322 K, which is way below 373 K. So no, the water doesn't boil; it just heats up. So my calculation should be correct.

Alternatively, I should check if I did all the calculations correctly. Let me recheck.

I² R t: (1.75)^2 = 3.0625. Multiply by 25 ohms: 3.0625 *25 = 76.5625. Multiply by 100 s: 76.5625 *100 =7656.25 J. Correct.

Then m*c = 82.5 *4.184. Let me calculate that again: 82 *4.184 = let's see, 80*4.184=334.72, 2*4.184=8.368, so 334.72 +8.368=343.088. Then 0.5 *4.184=2.092. So total is 343.088 + 2.092 = 345.18 J/K. Correct.

So Q/(m c) =7656.25 /345.18 ≈22.2 K. So final T is 300 +22.2=322.2 K, which is 322 K rounded. So option A is correct.

But wait, another thought: is the mass in grams or kilograms? No, no, the question says 82.5 grams, so we're good.

Wait another thing: did I mix up the formula? No, Q equals I squared R t is correct for the electrical energy converted to heat. And then Q equals m c delta T is correct for the heat absorbed by water. So all steps seem right.

I think I'm confident that the answer is A: 322 K.

The problem involves calculating the final temperature of water heated by an immersion heater. First, the heat energy \( Q \) generated by the heater is determined using the formula \( Q = I^2 \cdot R \cdot t \). Substituting the given values \( I = 1.75 \, \mathrm{A} \), \( R = 25.0 \, \Omega \), and \( t = 100 \, \mathrm{s} \), we find \( Q = 7656.25 \, \mathrm{J} \).

Next, the temperature change \( \Delta T \) of the water is calculated using the formula \( Q = m \cdot c \cdot \Delta T \), where \( m = 82.5 \, \mathrm{g} \) and \( c = 4.184 \, \mathrm{J/(g \cdot K)} \). Rearranging for \( \Delta T \), we get \( \Delta T = \frac{Q}{m \cdot c} \). The denominator \( m \cdot c \) is calculated as \( 345.18 \, \mathrm{J/K} \), and dividing \( Q \) by this value gives \( \Delta T \approx 22.2 \, \mathrm{K} \).

Adding this temperature change to the initial temperature of \( 300 \, \mathrm{K} \), the final temperature is \( 322.2 \, \mathrm{K} \), which rounds to \( 322 \, \mathrm{K} \). Since this temperature is below the boiling point of water at \( 1.00 \, \mathrm{bar} \), the water does not boil, and the calculation is valid.

Thus, the final temperature of the water is **322 K**.
