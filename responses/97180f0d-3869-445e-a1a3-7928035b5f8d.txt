Question:

What factors limit the number oftrophiclevels in afood chain?

Options:

A: Constant energy levels across all trophic levels
B: Increase in nutrient availability at each level
C: Decrease in carbon dioxide concentration
D: Increase in biomass at each successive level
E: Great decrease (90%) in available energy at each level
F: Decrease in the number of predators
G: High reproductive rates at higher trophic levels
H: Increase in available energy at each level
I: Increase in the number of organisms
J: Uniform distribution of organisms across all levels

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what limits the number of trophic levels in a food chain. I remember that trophic levels are the steps in a food chain, starting from producers, then herbivores, then carnivores, and so on. Each level gets energy from the one before it.

Wait, I think the main thing is about energy transfer. I remember something about only a small percentage of energy being passed on to the next level. Like, maybe around 90% is lost. So each level has less energy than the previous one. That means you can't have too many levels because eventually, there's not enough energy left to support the next level.

Looking at the options, option E says a great decrease (90%) in available energy at each level. That sounds right because each step up the chain loses most of the energy. So the number of levels is limited by this energy loss. 

Other options don't seem to fit. For example, option A says constant energy levels, but that's not true because energy decreases. Option B talks about increasing nutrients, which isn't the main factor. Option D mentions increase in biomass, which might not always happen and isn't the main limiter. Option H is about increasing energy, which is the opposite of what happens. Options F, G, I, and J don't directly relate to the energy transfer issue.

The number of trophic levels in a food chain is primarily limited by the significant decrease in available energy at each successive level, typically around a 90% loss. This energy loss occurs because only a small portion of the energy from one trophic level is transferred to the next, due to metabolic processes and other factors. Therefore, the correct answer is E.

Answer: E
