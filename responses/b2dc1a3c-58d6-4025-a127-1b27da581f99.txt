D: Insemination is the act of physical joining, fertilization is the union of male and female gametes, and copulation is the process of depositing semen into the vagina.
E: Copulation is the union of male and female gametes, insemination is the act of physical joining, and fertilization is the process of depositing semen.
F: Fertilization is the act of physical joining, insemination is the process of depositing semen, and copulation is the union of the male and female gametes.
G: Fertilization is the process of depositing semen, copulation is the union of the sperm and egg, and insemination is the act of physical joining of two sex partners.
H: Insemination is the act of physical joining, copulation is the process of depositing semen, and fertilization is the union of the sperm and egg.
I: Copulation is the process of depositing semen, insemination is the act of physical joining, and fertilization is the union of the sperm and egg within the vagina.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about distinguishing between copulation, insemination, and fertilization. I'm a bit confused about these terms, so I need to think carefully.

First, I should probably define each term. Copulation is usually the act of sexual intercourse, right? Like when two partners physically join for sexual purposes. Then there's insemination, which I think refers to the actual depositing of semen into the vagina. That happens during ejaculation, so maybe insemination is the process where the semen is placed there, which can lead to fertilization.

Fertilization is when the sperm and egg combine to form a zygote. So that's the actual union of the gametes. 

Looking at the options now. Option A says: Copulation is the physical joining, insemination is depositing semen into the vagina, and fertilization is the union of gametes. That seems to fit what I was thinking. 

Option B swaps things around, saying copulation is depositing semen, which doesn't sound right because copulation is more about the act itself, not just the semen deposit. Option C also seems off because it says fertilization is the physical joining, which isn't correct. 

Option D says insemination is the physical joining, which I don't think is right because insemination is more about the semen being placed inside. Option E is also wrong because it confuses copulation with fertilization. Similarly, F and G mix up the terms incorrectly. 

Option H says insemination is the physical joining, which I don't think is correct. Option I says copulation is the process of depositing semen, which again, that's insemination. So I is wrong. Option J swaps copulation and insemination, which is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be option A.

The correct answer is A: Copulation is the act of physical joining of two sex partners, insemination is the process of depositing semen into the vagina, and fertilization is the union of the male and female gametes to produce the zygote.
