Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Oh, shame on you, poor Winter King!
What's this that you have done?
Is 't not a very naughty thing
To snatch the kaiser's crown?
Now you will have to stay away
Alike from Rhine and Prague,
And more than that-shame and dismay
Your days and nights will plague.
Right well you knew, and all the world,
Right well they know this thing,
That Ferdinand alone can be
Bohemia's lawful king.
So come, dear Fritz, rouse up and go
To Ferdinand, your king,
And beg him graciously to show
Full pardon for your sin.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out the underlying issue in this song. Let me read through the lyrics again to understand what's going on. 

The song starts with "Oh, shame on you, poor Winter King!" and mentions snatching the kaiser's crown. So, it seems like someone took a crown they shouldn't have. The Winter King is being scolded for something naughty. The lines about having to stay away from Rhine and Prague suggest he's being exiled or restricted, maybe losing his territories. 

Then it says Ferdinand alone can be Bohemia's lawful king. Ferdinand is probably the rightful ruler, so the Winter King took the crown, which led to this situation. The song advises the Winter King, called Fritz, to go to Ferdinand and beg for pardon. 

So, the main issue here is about who should be the king. It's about successionâ€”whether the Winter King had the right to the crown or if Ferdinand was the lawful one. The song supports Ferdinand, implying that the Winter King's claim was incorrect. Therefore, the underlying issue is about the rules of royal succession.

The song discusses the legitimacy of the Winter King's claim to the crown, highlighting the conflict over who should be the rightful ruler. This centers on the rules of royal succession.
