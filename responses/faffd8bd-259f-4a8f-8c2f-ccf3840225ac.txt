Okay, so I have this question about a manufacturer who produces a saw. He has direct costs and overhead costs, and he needs to set a minimum price to avoid short-term loss. I'm a bit rusty on my accounting, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the manufacturer's costs are given as $13 in direct costs and $10 in overhead or indirect costs. Wait, so that means the total cost per saw is $13 plus $10, which adds up to $23. Right, because direct costs are the ones directly related to production, like materials and labor, and overhead includes things like rent, utilities, which are indirect but necessary.

Now, the question is about the minimum price he must sell the saw so he doesn't incur a short-term loss. Short-term loss, I think, refers to not making enough to cover all his costs in the short run. So, in accounting terms, this is about the break-even point. The break-even price is where total revenue equals total cost, so he neither makes a profit nor a loss.

So to calculate the break-even price, I need to add up all the costs and then set the price at that amount. That way, each saw sold at that price covers all the costs. If he sells it for less, he'll start incurring a loss.

Wait, but sometimes there's a distinction between fixed and variable costs. Oh, right! Overhead costs can be fixed or variable. But in this question, it's just given as overhead or indirect costs, and I'm not told whether they're fixed or variable. Hmm. But since the question is about the minimum price to avoid short-term loss, I think it's referring to the variable cost approach because in the short term, fixed costs are already covered, but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, noâ€”if he's calculating the minimum price, he needs to cover both fixed and variable costs. Because if he sells below total cost, he'll lose money overall.

Wait, no. Wait, in the short term, sometimes companies can operate even if they're not covering all fixed costs, but that's more about whether they should continue production or shut down. But in this case, the question is about not incurring a short-term loss, which I think means that revenue should at least cover all costs, both direct and indirect.

So, the total cost per unit is $13 (direct) + $10 (overhead) = $23. Therefore, the minimum selling price should be at least $23 to break even. Because if he sells each saw for $23, he covers all his costs and doesn't lose money. If he sells below that, he's making a loss per unit.

Looking at the options, F is $23. So the answer should be F.

The manufacturer's total cost per saw is the sum of direct and overhead costs: $13 + $10 = $23. To avoid a short-term loss, the selling price must at least cover all costs, which is the break-even point. Therefore, the minimum price is $23.

Answer: F
