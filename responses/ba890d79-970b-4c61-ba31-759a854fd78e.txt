Question:

A retiree owned a building in a city. Several years ago, an artist, in a signed writing, entered a three- year lease agreement with the retiree. The artist agreed to pay $800 monthly rent for the third-floor apartment in the retiree's building. The original three-year term had long since expired, but the artist has continued to pay his rent, and the retiree continued to accept it. The building became infested with rats after a restaurant was opened in the adjacent building. The artist could not tolerate the rats and served notice on the retiree that he was moving to another city and has not been heard from since. At common law, what remedy was available to the retiree before she accepted the first rental payment after the end of the initial three-year period?

Options:

A: Recovery of double the rent prorated on a monthly basis for the number of months the artist was on the premises beyond the three- year period.
B: Sue the artist for damages due to the infestation of rats.
C: Recovery of the difference between the lease price and the fair market value of the leasehold for a year.
D: Eviction of the artist for non-payment of rent.
E: Require that the artist move out immediately or be held responsible for three years' rent.
F: Seek a court order to compel the artist to continue the lease for another three years.
G: Require the artist to pay for the extermination of the rats.
H: Terminate the lease agreement without any further obligations.
I: Recovery of triple the rent prorated on a monthly basis for the number of months the artist was on the premises beyond the three- year period.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about property law, specifically dealing with lease agreements and the remedies available to a landlord after the initial term has expired. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the facts: A retiree owns a building and leased a third-floor apartment to an artist for three years at $800 a month. The lease term has expired, but the artist has been paying rent, and the retiree has been accepting it. So, it seems like the lease turned into a month-to-month tenancy because both parties continued the arrangement after the initial term ended.

Then, a problem arises: a restaurant opened next door, causing rats to infest the building. The artist couldn't tolerate this and gave notice that he's moving. Since then, he hasn't been heard from. The question is about the remedies available to the retiree before she accepted the first rental payment after the three-year period ended.

I remember that in common law, when a lease term ends and the tenant stays on the property, paying rent and the landlord accepting it, this usually creates a periodic tenancy. Typically, this is month-to-month, meaning either party can terminate the tenancy by giving notice of at least one full rental period (like 30 days for a month-to-month lease).

Now, the issue here is the rat infestation. But wait, the artist served notice before the problem started? Or after? The problem says the restaurant opened, causing rats, and then the artist gave notice. So the rats were the cause for the artist leaving. But the question is about the remedies before she accepted the first rental payment after the initial term. Hmm, that might be a bit confusing.

Wait, the question is about what was available before she accepted the first payment after the three years. So, immediately after the three years, when the artist continued to pay, the lease became a periodic tenancy. At that point, the landlord had certain rights.

One key point in property law is that after the lease term, if the tenant remains, the tenancy becomes periodic. The landlord can choose to accept rent and continue the tenancy or treat it as a month-to-month and serve notice if they want to terminate.

But the question is about the remedies available before she accepted the first payment after the initial term. So right when the three years were up, before any further payments, what could she do?

I think about the options. Looking at the options:

A: Recovery of double rent. That sounds like a penalty, but I'm not sure under what circumstances that applies. Maybe if the tenant holds over without the landlord's permission, but I think that's for when the landlord doesn't renew and the tenant stays, leading to potential penalties.

B: Sue for damages due to rats. But the artist was the one who left because of the rats. The landlord might not be liable for rodent infestations unless they were negligent. But the question is about the initial period, so maybe not directly relevant here.

C: Recovery of difference between lease price and fair market value. That sounds more like a claim for increased rent, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

D: Evict for non-payment. But the artist was paying rent, so non-payment isn't the issue here.

E: Require the artist to move immediately or be liable for three years' rent. That sounds like a holdover tenant situation. If the lease ends, and the tenant stays without a new lease, the landlord can treat it as a periodic tenancy or terminate. But the option here seems to suggest that the tenant must leave or pay for three years. I'm not sure if that's the case.

F: Court order to compel another three years. That would require the lease to be extended, but at common law, the periodic tenancy doesn't automatically renew for a fixed term unless agreed upon. So the landlord can't force another three years.

G: Make the artist pay for extermination. That could be a possibility, but the landlord might have a duty to maintain the premises. If the problem was the landlord's fault, maybe, but the issue here is the restaurant next door, which might not be the landlord's responsibility unless there's a covenant.

H: Terminate the lease without obligations. That seems possible because after the initial term, the landlord can choose to end the lease by giving proper notice. But the question is about what was available before accepting the first payment after the term. So, if the landlord decides not to renew, she can terminate, but if she accepts rent, it becomes periodic.

I: Recovery of triple rent. That's a harsher penalty than double, which I think is more for cases where the landlord is forced to lease longer than intended.

Wait, the key here is that the lease term had expired, and the artist continued to pay rent. So the initial three years passed, and then the artist paid rent again. Before accepting that payment, the retiree had the option to either renew the lease or treat it as a new periodic term. If she didn't accept the payment, she could terminate the lease.

But the question is about the remedies before accepting the first payment after the three years. So, at that point, she could choose to end the lease, which would give her the right to terminate without any further obligations.

Looking at the options, H says "Terminate the lease agreement without any further obligations." That seems correct because once the lease term ends, the landlord can choose not to renew and terminate the lease, especially if there's no new agreement.

Alternatively, if she accepts the rent, it becomes a periodic tenancy, but before accepting, she can terminate.

So the answer should be H.

At common law, when a lease term expires and the tenant continues to pay rent while the landlord accepts it, a periodic tenancy is typically formed. However, before accepting the first payment after the initial lease term, the landlord has the option to terminate the lease without any further obligations. This is because the lease term had ended, and the landlord could choose not to renew the agreement. 

The correct answer is:

H: Terminate the lease agreement without any further obligations.

Answer: H
