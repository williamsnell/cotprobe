Question:

In very basic terms describe the structure of a retroviral virion.

Options:

A: The virion is composed of the DNA genome, a surrounding protein capsid, and an inner lipid bilayer envelope.
B: The virion is composed of the RNA genome, a surrounding carbohydrate capsid, and an outer protein bilayer envelope.
C: The virion is composed solely of an RNA genome.
D: The virion is composed of the RNA genome and an outer carbohydrate bilayer envelope, without a capsid.
E: The virion is composed of the RNA genome, a surrounding protein capsid, and an outer lipid bilayer envelope.
F: The virion is composed of the DNA genome, a surrounding carbohydrate capsid, and an outer lipid bilayer envelope.
G: The virion is composed of the DNA genome, a surrounding lipid bilayer capsid, and an outer carbohydrate envelope.
H: The virion is composed of the RNA genome, a surrounding carbohydrate capsid, and an inner protein bilayer envelope.
I: The virion is composed of the RNA genome, a surrounding lipid bilayer capsid, and an inner protein envelope.
J: The virion is composed of a protein genome, a surrounding carbohydrate capsid, and an outer lipid bilayer envelope.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out the structure of a retroviral virion. I remember that viruses have different parts like their genome and various layers around it. So, let's think about what a retrovirus is. Retroviruses are known for having RNA as their genetic material, right? Unlike DNA viruses, they use RNA. 

Now, the structure. Viruses usually have a core, which is the genome, surrounded by a capsid, which is a protein shell. But some viruses also have an envelope around the capsid. I think retroviruses have an envelope because I remember that HIV, which is a retrovirus, has a lipid envelope. 

Wait, so the core would be RNA. Then around it is the capsid made of proteins. After that, there's an envelope. But what's the envelope made of? I think it's a lipid bilayer, similar to a cell membrane, and it's covered with proteins. These proteins help the virus attach to host cells. 

Looking at the options, let's go through them. Option A says DNA genome, which can't be right because retroviruses use RNA. Option B has an RNA genome, which is correct, but it says a carbohydrate capsid and outer protein bilayer. Hmm, I'm not sure about the carbohydrate capsid. I think the capsid is protein, not carbohydrate. Option C is just RNA, which seems too simple for a virion structure. 

Option D has RNA and a carbohydrate bilayer without a capsid. That doesn't sound right because I believe the capsid is part of the structure. Option E: RNA, protein capsid, outer lipid envelope. That fits better. The RNA core, surrounded by a protein capsid, then the lipid envelope. 

Option F uses DNA again, so wrong. G has DNA and lipid capsid, which is incorrect. H has RNA, carbohydrate capsid, and inner protein. That doesn't seem right because the outer layer is usually the envelope. I says RNA, lipid capsid, inner protein. Wait, that would mean the capsid is lipid, which I don't think is correct. The capsid is protein. 

J has a protein genome, which is wrong because retroviruses have RNA. So the correct structure should be RNA genome, protein capsid, and outer lipid bilayer envelope. That matches option E.

The correct structure of a retroviral virion consists of an RNA genome surrounded by a protein capsid and an outer lipid bilayer envelope. 

Answer: E
