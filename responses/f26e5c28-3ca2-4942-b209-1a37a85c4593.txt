Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about ring theory, specifically dealing with integral domains and polynomial rings. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question presents two statements and asks whether each is true or not. The options are combinations of the two evaluations. Let me break down each statement separately.

**Statement 1:** If R is an integral domain, then R[x] is an integral domain.

Hmm, I remember that an integral domain is a commutative ring with unity that has no zero divisors. So, if R is an integral domain, does that mean R[x], the ring of polynomials over R, is also an integral domain?

I think yes. Because in R[x], the multiplication of two non-zero polynomials should result in a non-zero polynomial. Suppose f(x) and g(x) are polynomials in R[x], and neither is the zero polynomial. The leading terms of f(x) and g(x) would be non-zero since R is an integral domain. When you multiply them, the leading term of the product would be the product of the leading terms, which is non-zero. Therefore, the product f(x)g(x) isn't the zero polynomial. So R[x] should indeed be an integral domain. So Statement 1 is True.

**Statement 2:** If R is a ring and f(x) and g(x) are in R[x], then deg(f(x)g(x)) = deg(f(x)) + deg(g(x)).

Wait, I thought this is true when R is an integral domain. But the statement here says R is just a ring. So does it hold for any ring?

I recall that in general, for any ring R, the degree of the product of two polynomials is less than or equal to the sum of their degrees. But equality holds only if the leading coefficients multiply to something non-zero. So if R has zero divisors, it's possible that the leading coefficients could multiply to zero, making the degree of the product less than the sum.

For example, let R be the ring of integers modulo 2, which is a field, so in this case, it's an integral domain. Let's say f(x)=x and g(x)=x. Then f(x)g(x)=x^2, so degree 2, which is 1+1=2. That works.

But wait, let me think of a different ring where this might fail. Suppose R is the ring of integers modulo 6, which is not an integral domain because 2*3=0 mod 6. Let f(x) = 2x + 1 and g(x) = 3x + 1. Both are non-zero polynomials. The leading coefficients are 2 and 3. When multiplied, (2x)(3x)=6x², which is 0 mod 6. So the product f(x)g(x) would be 6x² + ... (other terms), but the x² term is zero. So the highest degree term would be the next one. Let's compute the product:

(2x +1)(3x +1) = 6x² + 2x + 3x +1 = 0x² +5x +1. So the degree is 1, but the sum of the degrees of f and g was 1+1=2. So here, the degree of the product is less than the sum. Therefore, in this case, Statement 2 is False because it claims equality, but in this example, it doesn't hold.

Wait, but wait another moment. The ring R in the second statement is any ring. So in some rings, it might hold, but in others, it doesn't. So the statement says it's always true, but that's not the case. So Statement 2 is False.

Wait, but wait another thought: I think the degree formula holds when the ring R is such that the leading coefficients are not zero divisors. So if R is an integral domain, then the leading coefficients can't be zero divisors, so their product can't be zero, hence the degree of the product would be the sum. But for a general ring, as in my example, it's not necessarily true.

Wait, but in the question, Statement 2 doesn't specify that R is an integral domain; it's just a ring. So the statement says that for any ring, R, and any polynomials f and g in R[x], the degree of the product is the sum of their degrees. But as shown in the example, that's not always true. So Statement 2 is False.

Wait, but wait again: Let me double-check. Suppose R is a ring without zero divisors, i.e., an integral domain. Then, indeed, the product's degree would be the sum. But the statement doesn't say R is an integral domain; it's any ring. So the statement is making a general claim, which is incorrect because there exist rings where it fails. Therefore, Statement 2 is False.

So putting it together:

Statement 1: True

Statement 2: False

Looking at the options, option C is "True, False". So the answer should be C.

The first statement is true because if R is an integral domain, then R[x] inherits this property. The second statement is false because, in general rings (not necessarily integral domains), the degree formula may not hold due to zero divisors. 

Answer: C
