Okay, so I've got this math problem here: I need to find 1 over 6 plus 1 over 8. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when adding fractions, they need to have the same denominator. Right, so I should find a common denominator for 6 and 8.

Wait, what's the easiest way to find a common denominator? I think it's the least common multiple (LCM) of the two denominators. So, let's list the multiples of 6 and 8 and find the smallest one they share. 

Multiples of 6 are 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and so on. Multiples of 8 are 8, 16, 24, 32, etc. Oh, I see, 24 is the first common multiple. So, 24 is the least common denominator.

Now, I need to convert both fractions to have 24 as the denominator. Let's start with 1/6. To get from 6 to 24, I multiply the denominator by 4. So, I should do the same to the numerator. 1 times 4 is 4. So, 1/6 becomes 4/24.

Next, let's convert 1/8. To get from 8 to 24, I multiply the denominator by 3. So, the numerator also gets multiplied by 3. 1 times 3 is 3. So, 1/8 becomes 3/24.

Now, adding these two fractions together: 4/24 plus 3/24. Since the denominators are the same, I can just add the numerators. 4 plus 3 is 7, so the sum is 7/24.

Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 1/6 is approximately 0.1667, and 1/8 is 0.125. Adding them together gives around 0.2917. Now, 7 divided by 24 is approximately 0.2917 as well, so that checks out.

Looking at the options provided, E is 7 over 24, which matches my calculation. So, I'm confident that E is the correct answer.

The correct answer is E: 7 over 24.
