Question:

A construction company was doing repairs and replacing portions of a sidewalk and railing next to a lake. The construction crew started tearing out the old sidewalk and railing, but stopped work when it started to get dark. The construction crew left without putting up a warning sign or barrier around the work area. A few hours later, a jogger came along the sidewalk. Not realizing the construction work was in progress there, the jogger stumbled and fell at the spot where the construction crew had torn up the sidewalk and railing. The jogger fell into the lake. As the jogger was attempting to stay afloat, he began screaming, "Help! Help! I can't swim. I'm drowning. " His screams attracted the attention of a person who was passing on his bicycle. The cyclist immediately hurried to assist the jogger. As the cyclist was leaning over the edge of the lake, trying to help the jogger get out of the water, he lost his balance and fell into the lake. Both the jogger and cyclist suffered serious bodily injuries before they were pulled out of the water by police. In a negligence action by the cyclist to recover for his personal injuries, the construction company will most probably

Options:

A: not be held liable, because the construction company could not foresee that anyone would be hurt while trying to rescue someone from the lake.
B: not be held liable, because the cyclist assumed the risk by leaning over the edge of the lake.
C: not be held liable, because it was the jogger's responsibility to avoid the construction area.
D: be held liable, because they did not properly secure the worksite after finishing for the day.
E: be held liable, because the construction company would be strictly liable to anyone injured by the failure to put adequate warnings or barriers around the site of the sidewalk repairs.
F: be held liable, because the cyclist's attempt to rescue the jogger was foreseeable.
G: not be held liable, because the jogger should have been aware of the construction work.
H: be held liable, because they failed to provide adequate lighting for the construction site.
I: not be held liable, because the cyclist voluntarily put himself in danger.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this negligence question. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the scenario is a construction company doing repairs next to a lake. They tore up the sidewalk and railing but left without putting up any warning signs or barriers. It got dark, and a jogger came by, fell into the lake because of the construction site, and started screaming. A cyclist heard him and tried to help, fell in too, and both got hurt. Now, the cyclist is suing the construction company for his injuries.

The question is about whether the construction company will be held liable for the cyclist's injuries. The options are A through I, each giving a different reason.

First, I need to recall the elements of negligence. There's duty, breach, causation, and damages. So, did the construction company have a duty to the cyclist? Duty usually arises when there's a foreseeable risk of harm. Construction sites are dangerous, so they should take precautions.

They tore up the sidewalk but didn't put up any barriers or signs. That seems like a breach because they left the area unsafe. Now, the jogger fell because of that, and then the cyclist came to help. The question is whether the construction company can be liable for the cyclist's injuries.

In terms of foreseeability, the company might have reasonably expected that someone could fall into the water, but would they have foreseen someone trying to rescue another person? Hmm. The duty usually extends to foreseeable risks, but the rescuer might be considered a foreseeable person. Like, if you create a hazard, you can be liable for injuries to those who come to help.

Looking at the options:

A: Not liable because couldn't foresee someone being hurt while rescuing. But I think foreseeability isn't the main issue here; they could have foreseen someone falling and getting injured, and maybe someone trying to help. So A might not be correct.

B: Not liable because cyclist assumed the risk. Assumption of risk is when the person voluntarily takes on known dangers. But the cyclist didn't know about the construction siteâ€”he came to help the jogger. So he didn't assume the risk, making B incorrect.

C: Not liable because jogger should have avoided. But the company's duty isn't just to the jogger; they owe a duty to anyone who might be on the site, including rescuers. So C might not be right.

D: Held liable because didn't secure the site. That sounds plausible. Leaving the site unguarded is a breach of duty, leading to injuries. But does it include the cyclist's injuries?

E: Strict liability because of failure to warn. But strict liability isn't usually the case in construction; it's negligence. Plus, not all cases are strict liability unless it's a specific type of case, like product liability. So E might not fit.

F: Held liable because rescuing was foreseeable. I think this is a good point. If the company should have foreseen that someone might try to rescue, then their breach led to the cyclist's injuries. So F is a possible correct answer.

G: Not liable because jogger should have been aware. But the jogger didn't know about the construction, so G doesn't make sense.

H: Held liable for lack of lighting. The question doesn't mention anything about lighting, so H might not be relevant.

I: Not liable because cyclist voluntarily put himself in danger. But the cyclist was trying to help someone in distress; it's a Good Samaritan situation. Plus, the construction company's negligence created the hazard that led the jogger to need help. So I think the company's duty extends to the cyclist's injuries.

So, between D and F. D says they didn't secure the site, which is true, but does that cover the cyclist? F says the rescue was foreseeable, which makes the company liable for the cyclist's injuries.

I think F is the better answer because the construction company's negligence created the situation that led to the jogger's fall, and it's foreseeable that someone would try to help, thus making the company liable for the cyclist's injuries as a foreseeable consequence.

The construction company owed a duty of care by failing to secure the worksite, which led to the jogger's fall and the cyclist's subsequent injuries. The rescue attempt was a foreseeable consequence of the unsafe conditions created by the company. Therefore, the construction company is liable for the cyclist's injuries.

Answer: F
