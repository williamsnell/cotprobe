Question:

A microcomputer used for data acquisition and control is required to digitize and process four analog input signals and to output their average continually; i.e., in real time. The time for an external analog-to-digital converter (which is triggered by a CPU instruction) to digitize one input is 12 microseconds, and only one digitization occurs at a time. Five CPU instructions, including the triggering instruction, must be executed for each signal digitized. Ten CPU instructions are executed in order to average each set of four samples and output this value. The time to convert the output from digital to analog form is to be ignored. If it is assumed that suitable data buffering is employed, then the maximum average instruction execution time that allows the microcomputer to keep up with the input-output data rates, is

<think>
Alright, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. Okay, so the question is about a microcomputer used for data acquisition and control. The system needs to digitize four analog inputs and output their average continuously. 

First, I'll try to break down the problem. So, the microcomputer uses an external ADC, which takes 12 microseconds to digitize one input. And each digitization is triggered by a CPU instruction. Also, for each signal digitized, five CPU instructions are executed, including the trigger. So, for each sample, it's 5 instructions.

Then, when it comes to averaging, after collecting four samples, the system needs to compute their average and output it. For this averaging and output part, it takes ten CPU instructions. The output conversion time is ignored, so we don't have to worry about that.

The question is asking for the maximum average instruction execution time that allows the microcomputer to keep up with the data rates. So, I think this means we need to calculate the total time required for the system to process all four samples, compute the average, and output it, then find the average instruction time per CPU cycle that won't cause a backlog.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Digitize each of the four analog signals.
2. Compute the average of these four samples.
3. Output this average.

Each digitization takes 12 microseconds, and each requires five CPU instructions. So, for each signal, the time is 12 microseconds plus the time for 5 instructions. Wait, no—the 12 microseconds is the time for the ADC to digitize, and during that time, the CPU can execute instructions. Hmm, but the way it's worded is that the ADC takes 12 microseconds, and each digitization requires five instructions, including the trigger.

Wait, perhaps the ADC conversion takes 12 microseconds, and each conversion is initiated by an instruction. So, the CPU spends some time executing instructions, including the trigger, and during the ADC conversion time, the CPU can do other things, but the ADC is off doing its thing.

Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again. The ADC is triggered by a CPU instruction. The time for the ADC to convert is 12 microseconds. So, when the CPU sends the trigger, it takes 12 μs for the ADC to finish. But during that time, the CPU might be able to do other things, maybe other instructions, but perhaps the ADC is a separate process. But I'm not entirely clear on whether the CPU has to wait for the ADC to finish before moving on or if the CPU can proceed with other instructions.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the ADC is triggered, and while it's converting (taking 12 μs), the CPU can execute other instructions. So, for each sample, the CPU spends 5 instructions to trigger the ADC and possibly handle other tasks, but the ADC conversion itself doesn't tie up the CPU; it's an external process. So, perhaps the CPU can interleave other operations while waiting for the ADC to finish.

But wait, the problem states that only one digitization occurs at a time. So, the ADC can't process multiple conversions simultaneously. So, each conversion is done sequentially. Therefore, for each sample, the CPU issues a trigger instruction (which is part of the 5 instructions per sample), and then the ADC takes 12 μs to convert. But the CPU can proceed with other instructions during that 12 μs, perhaps processing other tasks, like computing the average once all four samples are in.

Wait, but the CPU needs to process each sample, so for each of the four signals, it's 5 instructions plus the 12 μs for the ADC. But perhaps the ADC's conversion time doesn't count against the CPU's instruction time, because the ADC is external. So, the CPU can perform other instructions while the ADC is converting.

Wait, but the problem says that the time for the ADC to digitize is 12 μs, and only one digitization occurs at a time. So, each digitization takes 12 μs, but during that time, the CPU can execute other instructions, perhaps. So, the total time per sample would be the time the CPU takes to execute the 5 instructions plus any other necessary instructions, but perhaps the ADC conversion time is asynchronous to the CPU instructions.

Alternatively, maybe the ADC conversion time is added to the CPU's instruction time. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, let's re-express the problem. The ADC takes 12 μs per digitization, and each digitization is triggered by a CPU instruction. So, for each sample, the CPU must issue an instruction (part of the 5 per sample) to trigger the ADC, which then takes 12 μs. But during those 12 μs, the CPU can execute other instructions, perhaps. But the problem says that only one digitization occurs at a time, meaning the ADC can't be triggered again until the previous conversion is done. So, the CPU can't trigger another ADC until the previous one is complete.

But perhaps the CPU can start processing the data while the ADC is converting. For example, once the first sample is triggered, the ADC takes 12 μs, but the CPU can process other instructions, like starting the next sample or preparing for the next.

Wait, but the problem says that the system must process four samples and output their average continually. So, perhaps we need to calculate the total time required to process one complete cycle (digitize four samples, compute average, output) and then determine the maximum average instruction time per instruction so that the system can keep up.

Let me try to structure this.

Each sample requires:

- 5 CPU instructions to trigger the ADC and any other setup.

- The ADC takes 12 μs to digitize.

But the ADC's conversion time is 12 μs, so for each sample, the ADC is busy for 12 μs, during which the CPU can execute other instructions, perhaps.

Wait, but if the ADC can't be triggered again until it's done, then the total time per sample is the time taken by the CPU to execute the 5 instructions plus the 12 μs conversion time. But that might not be correct because the conversion time is external and doesn't directly add to the CPU's instruction time.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 μs is the time from the trigger until the data is available. So, the CPU can issue the trigger, then during the 12 μs, it can execute other instructions, but the ADC is busy and can't be triggered again until it's done.

So, for each sample, the CPU needs to issue a trigger (1 instruction), which takes 12 μs, but during that time, the CPU can execute 4 more instructions (since each sample requires 5 instructions). So, perhaps the total time per sample is 12 μs plus the time taken by the other 4 instructions.

Wait, but that might not be the right way to model it. Let me think again.

Each sample requires 5 CPU instructions, including the trigger. So, for each sample, the CPU must execute 5 instructions. The ADC takes 12 μs after being triggered. So, the CPU can't trigger another ADC until the previous one is done. So, the time per sample is the time to execute 5 instructions plus 12 μs, but perhaps the 12 μs is overlapped with some of the instructions.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 μs is the time that the ADC takes, and during that time, the CPU can execute some instructions, but the ADC can't be triggered again until it's done.

Wait, perhaps the best approach is to model the entire process.

First, to digitize four samples:

Each sample requires 5 instructions and 12 μs of ADC conversion time.

Assuming that the ADC can be triggered once, and the CPU can't trigger another until the previous is done. So, the CPU must wait for the ADC to finish before triggering the next.

But during the ADC conversion time, the CPU can execute other instructions, such as processing the data or preparing for the next sample.

Wait, but for each sample, the CPU must execute 5 instructions, including the trigger. So, perhaps for each sample, the time taken is the time for the CPU to execute 5 instructions plus the 12 μs of ADC conversion.

But that might not be correct because the ADC's conversion is initiated by the CPU, but during the 12 μs, the CPU can execute other instructions, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps the ADC conversion time is a fixed period after the trigger, and the CPU can proceed to execute other instructions during that time. So, the total time per sample is the time taken to execute the 5 instructions plus any other necessary processing, but the ADC's 12 μs is a separate time.

Alternatively, perhaps the ADC's conversion time is in parallel with the CPU's instruction execution, so the total time per sample is the maximum of the CPU instruction time and the ADC conversion time.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think in terms of cycles.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. For each of the four analog inputs, we need to digitize them.

   a. For each input, the CPU executes 5 instructions, one of which triggers the ADC.

   b. The ADC takes 12 μs to digitize the input. But during this time, the CPU can execute other instructions.

2. Once all four samples are digitized, the CPU must execute 10 instructions to compute the average and output it.

So, the total processing time per cycle (digitizing four samples and computing the average) is the sum of the time taken to process each sample plus the time to compute the average.

But how do the ADC conversion times and CPU instructions interleave?

Perhaps the ADC conversion for each sample takes 12 μs, but the CPU can start the next sample's ADC conversion as soon as the previous one is complete. So, the total ADC conversion time for four samples would be 4 * 12 μs = 48 μs.

But during this time, the CPU is executing instructions for each sample.

Wait, but each sample requires 5 instructions, including the trigger. So, the CPU must execute 5 instructions for each sample, which would take 5 * T_avg, where T_avg is the average instruction execution time.

So, for four samples, the CPU must execute 4 * 5 = 20 instructions, taking 20 * T_avg.

Additionally, after all four samples are digitized, the CPU must execute 10 instructions to compute the average and output it, taking 10 * T_avg.

So, the total CPU time per cycle is (20 + 10) * T_avg = 30 * T_avg.

But the ADC conversion for each sample takes 12 μs, and since they can't overlap (only one at a time), the total ADC time is 4 * 12 = 48 μs.

Now, the total time for the system to process one cycle (digitize four samples and compute average) is the maximum of the CPU time and the ADC time, but perhaps they can overlap in some way.

Alternatively, since the ADC conversions are sequential, the total time for the ADCs is 48 μs, and the CPU can execute its instructions during the ADC conversion times and in between.

Wait, perhaps the total time is the sum of the ADC conversion times plus the CPU processing times, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the entire cycle as the sum of the ADC conversion times and the CPU instruction times, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the system must process each sample in a way that the ADC conversion for the next sample can start as soon as the previous data is available. So, the ADC conversions are back-to-back, taking 4 * 12 = 48 μs.

Meanwhile, the CPU needs to process each sample's data, which requires 5 instructions per sample, so 20 instructions, plus 10 for the average, totaling 30 instructions.

If each instruction takes T_avg time, then the total CPU time is 30 * T_avg.

Now, the system must process all four samples and compute the average before the next set of samples comes in. So, the total time per cycle must be such that the system can keep up, meaning that the total time (CPU + ADC) must be less than or equal to the time between when the next set of samples is ready.

Wait, but perhaps the system is continuous, so the processing of the next samples must start as soon as the previous processing is done. So, the total time per cycle must be less than or equal to the time it takes for the next set of samples to be available.

Wait, perhaps the system needs to process each sample and compute the average before the next sample arrives. No, because it's four samples per average, so the processing of the average happens after all four are digitized.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the total time for the system to process all four samples and compute the average, and ensure that this time is less than or equal to the time available between the completion of the four samples and the arrival of the next set.

Wait, maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, since the system must output the average continually, the processing for the next set of four samples must start as soon as the previous average is computed.

So, the total time per cycle is the time taken for the four ADC conversions plus the CPU time to process all four samples and compute the average.

Wait, but the ADC conversions take 4 * 12 = 48 μs, and the CPU time is 30 * T_avg.

But perhaps the ADC conversions can overlap with the CPU processing, as the ADC is external.

Wait, maybe the ADC conversions are done sequentially, each taking 12 μs, but during each 12 μs, the CPU can execute some instructions.

So, for the first sample, the CPU triggers the ADC, which takes 12 μs. During that 12 μs, the CPU can execute some instructions, perhaps the other four instructions needed for that sample, or maybe instructions for the next sample.

Wait, perhaps each sample's ADC conversion is initiated by the CPU, and during the 12 μs, the CPU can execute the other four instructions for that sample.

So, for each sample, the CPU spends 5 instructions, which take 5 * T_avg time. The ADC takes 12 μs. The sample can be processed if 5 * T_avg <= 12 μs, because the ADC takes 12 μs, and the CPU can process the instructions in that time.

But wait, that's not necessarily correct because the ADC conversion starts when the trigger is issued, and during the 12 μs, the CPU can execute other instructions, perhaps for other samples or for processing.

Wait, perhaps the ADC conversion for each sample starts when the CPU issues the trigger, and during those 12 μs, the CPU can execute the remaining 4 instructions for that sample (since each sample requires 5 instructions). So, for each sample, the total time is the maximum of the ADC conversion time (12 μs) and the CPU instruction time (5 * T_avg).

But since 5 * T_avg must be <= 12 μs for the sample to be processed during the ADC conversion, otherwise the sample processing would take longer than the ADC conversion time, which isn't possible because the ADC can't be triggered again until it's done.

Wait, perhaps each sample's processing (5 instructions) must be completed before the ADC for that sample is ready. So, 5 * T_avg <= 12 μs. Therefore, T_avg <= 12 / 5 = 2.4 μs. But looking at the options, option C is 2.4 μs, which would be the maximum average instruction time.

But wait, that's only for the sample processing. Then, after all four samples are processed, the CPU needs to compute the average, which takes 10 instructions, so 10 * T_avg.

But the ADCs for all four samples would have taken 4 * 12 = 48 μs. So, the total time for the four samples would be the time taken by the ADCs plus any additional CPU time if the instructions take longer than the ADC conversion.

Wait, perhaps the total time for the four samples is the maximum between the ADC total time and the CPU time for the samples plus the average computation.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the total time for the four samples and the average computation, ensuring that the system can process everything in the time available, which is the time it takes for the next set of four samples to arrive.

Alternatively, perhaps the system's processing time must be less than or equal to the time it takes to collect four samples, which is four times the ADC conversion time plus any necessary CPU time.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try a different approach.

Each sample requires 5 instructions and an ADC conversion of 12 μs.

The CPU can execute these 5 instructions in 5 * T_avg time.

The ADC conversion takes 12 μs, but the CPU can trigger the next ADC as soon as the previous one is done.

So, the ADC for each sample starts as soon as the previous is done, meaning the ADCs are back-to-back, taking 4 * 12 = 48 μs.

But the CPU needs to process each sample's data, which requires 5 instructions per sample, so 4 samples = 20 instructions, plus 10 for the average, total 30 instructions, taking 30 * T_avg.

Now, the total processing time per cycle is the maximum of the ADC time (48 μs) and the CPU time (30 * T_avg). But since the ADCs are sequential, the CPU must finish its processing before the next cycle starts.

Wait, but the processing is interleaved. While the ADC is converting, the CPU can execute instructions.

So, perhaps the total time for the four samples is the sum of the ADC conversion times plus any CPU time that can't be overlapped.

Wait, perhaps the CPU can process the instructions for each sample while the ADC is converting the next sample. So, for each sample after the first, the CPU can process the instructions for that sample while the ADC is converting the next.

Wait, let's think of it as a pipeline.

Sample 1:

- CPU issues trigger (instruction 1), ADC takes 12 μs.

- During these 12 μs, the CPU can execute the remaining 4 instructions for sample 1, plus perhaps start processing for sample 2.

Sample 2:

- Once the ADC for sample 1 is done (after 12 μs), the CPU can trigger the ADC for sample 2 (instruction 5 for sample 2), which takes another 12 μs.

- During these 12 μs, the CPU can execute the remaining 4 instructions for sample 2, and so on.

So, for each sample, the ADC conversion time is 12 μs, and during that time, the CPU can execute 4 instructions for that sample.

Thus, for four samples, the total ADC time is 4 * 12 = 48 μs.

The total CPU instructions for samples are 4 * 5 = 20 instructions. Since during each sample's ADC conversion (12 μs), the CPU can execute 4 instructions, the time taken for the sample instructions is 20 instructions * T_avg.

But wait, the CPU can execute 4 instructions per sample during the ADC's 12 μs. So, 4 instructions per sample * 4 samples = 16 instructions, but each sample requires 5 instructions, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, for each sample, the CPU needs to execute 5 instructions. The first instruction triggers the ADC, which takes 12 μs. The remaining 4 instructions can be executed during that 12 μs. So, for each sample, the 5 instructions take 5 * T_avg time, but the ADC conversion takes 12 μs. So, the total time per sample is max(5*T_avg, 12 μs). But to keep the processing efficient, we want 5*T_avg <= 12 μs, so that the ADC conversion time is the limiting factor.

So, for each sample, the time taken is 12 μs, and during that time, the CPU can execute the 5 instructions, which would take 5*T_avg. But 5*T_avg must be <= 12 μs, so T_avg <= 12/5 = 2.4 μs.

But we also have to account for the average computation after all four samples are processed. So, after the fourth sample's ADC is done, the CPU needs to execute 10 instructions to compute the average and output it, taking 10 * T_avg.

So, the total time per cycle is the time for four ADC conversions (48 μs) plus the time for the average computation (10 * T_avg), but we need to ensure that the CPU can finish the average computation before the next cycle starts.

Wait, no, because the ADC conversions are sequential, taking 48 μs, and during that time, the CPU can execute the 20 instructions for the samples (4 * 5 = 20). So, the CPU time for the samples is 20 * T_avg, which must be <= 48 μs, because the ADC takes 48 μs and the CPU can execute instructions during that time.

So, 20 * T_avg <= 48 μs → T_avg <= 48/20 = 2.4 μs.

Additionally, after the ADCs are done, the CPU needs to compute the average, which takes 10 instructions, so 10 * T_avg.

But how much time is available for this? The ADCs finish at 48 μs, and the CPU needs to compute the average before the next cycle starts. So, the total time per cycle is 48 μs + 10 * T_avg.

But the system must process each cycle in time for the next set of samples. So, the time per cycle must be less than or equal to the time it takes for the next set of four samples to be available, which would be after 48 μs (since each sample takes 12 μs, four samples take 48 μs).

Wait, but that might not be correct because the ADCs are triggered sequentially, so after 48 μs, the next set's ADCs can start, but the CPU must have finished processing the previous set's average.

So, the total cycle time must be <= 48 μs, because the next set of four samples will be ready after 48 μs.

But the total cycle time is 48 μs (ADCs) + 10 * T_avg (CPU for average). So, we have:

48 μs + 10 * T_avg <= 48 μs → 10 * T_avg <= 0 → which is impossible. That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the cycle time. Maybe the cycle time is the time from the start of the ADC conversions for the first sample to the start of the ADC conversions for the next sample. So, the cycle time must be <= 48 μs, because each sample's ADC takes 12 μs, and the next sample's ADC can start immediately after the previous one is done.

But the CPU needs to finish processing the average by the time the next cycle starts, which is after 48 μs.

So, the total time for the CPU to process the samples and compute the average must be <= 48 μs.

The CPU processing time for the samples is 20 * T_avg, and for the average, 10 * T_avg. So, total CPU processing time is 30 * T_avg.

But this must fit within the 48 μs available between cycles. So:

30 * T_avg <= 48 μs → T_avg <= 48 / 30 = 1.6 μs.

Wait, that makes sense. Let me check:

So, each cycle (processing four samples and computing the average) must be completed within 48 μs, because the next cycle's ADCs start after 48 μs.

The CPU has 48 μs to process 30 instructions (20 for samples, 10 for average), so T_avg = 48 / 30 = 1.6 μs.

Looking at the options, option F is 1.6 μs.
</think>

To determine the maximum average instruction execution time that allows the microcomputer to keep up with the data rates, we analyze the system's processing requirements:

1. **Digitizing Four Samples**:  
   Each sample requires 5 CPU instructions and 12 μs for ADC conversion. The ADC conversions are sequential, so the total ADC time for four samples is:  
   \[
   4 \times 12 \, \mu\text{s} = 48 \, \mu\text{s}.
   \]  
   During this time, the CPU can execute the 20 instructions needed for the four samples (5 instructions per sample). The time for these instructions is:  
   \[
   20 \times T_{\text{avg}}.
   \]  
   To ensure the CPU can complete these instructions within the ADC conversion time:  
   \[
   20 \times T_{\text{avg}} \leq 48 \, \mu\text{s}.
   \]  
   Solving for \(T_{\text{avg}}\):  
   \[
   T_{\text{avg}} \leq \frac{48}{20} = 2.4 \, \mu\text{s}.
   \]

2. **Computing the Average**:  
   After digitizing the four samples, the CPU must execute 10 instructions to compute and output the average. The total cycle time (time between the start of one set of ADC conversions and the start of the next) must be less than or equal to the ADC conversion time for four samples (48 μs). Thus, the total CPU time for the cycle (20 instructions for samples + 10 instructions for the average) must fit within 48 μs:  
   \[
   30 \times T_{\text{avg}} \leq 48 \, \mu\text{s}.
   \]  
   Solving for \(T_{\text{avg}}\):  
   \[
   T_{\text{avg}} \leq \frac{48}{30} = 1.6 \, \mu\text{s}.
   \]

3. **Conclusion**:  
   The maximum average instruction execution time that allows the system to keep up with the data rates is **1.6 μs**.
