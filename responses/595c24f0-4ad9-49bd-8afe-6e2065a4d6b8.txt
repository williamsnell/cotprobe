Okay, so I'm trying to answer this economics question about GDP. Let me read it again. The question says that the price level in the US has gone up over the past year, but production of goods and services hasn't changed. I need to figure out what happens to nominal GDP and real GDP based on this.

Hmm, I remember that GDP can be measured in nominal and real terms. Nominal GDP uses current prices, while real GDP is adjusted for inflation. So if prices go up, but production stays the same, how does that affect each?

Let me think. Nominal GDP is calculated by multiplying the quantity of goods and services by their current prices. If the price level rises, even if production (which is the quantity) is the same, nominal GDP should increase. Because higher prices would make the same quantity worth more in nominal terms.

Real GDP, on the other hand, takes the nominal GDP and divides it by a price deflator to account for inflation. So if prices go up, but output is the same, real GDP would actually decrease because you're adjusting for higher prices. Wait, no, wait. Or does it stay the same? Because real GDP is about the actual quantity produced, regardless of price changes. So if production is constant, real GDP shouldn't change because it's based on quantities. Oh wait, no, real GDP is calculated using constant prices, so when prices rise, the same output would have a higher nominal GDP but the same real GDP. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me get this straight. Real GDP is nominal GDP divided by the GDP deflator. If prices go up, the GDP deflator increases. So if production (real GDP) is the same, but prices are up, then nominal GDP would increase because it's prices times quantity. So real GDP is calculated as nominal divided by the deflator. If the deflator goes up, then real GDP would stay the same because (increased nominal) / (increased deflator) = same real.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because real GDP is meant to represent the actual output, so if output is the same, real GDP shouldn't change. But the question is whether real GDP changes when prices go up but output doesn't. So real GDP would remain the same because it's based on quantities. So nominal GDP goes up because prices are higher, and real GDP stays the same.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D says nominal increased and real no change. So that's probably the answer. Let me think again to make sure.

If the price level increases, but the quantity produced (real GDP) doesn't change, then the total value (nominal GDP) would increase because each good's price is higher. But since the same amount is produced, real GDP remains the same. So yes, nominal increases, real stays the same. So the answer should be D: Increased and No change.

When the price level rises but production remains constant, nominal GDP increases because it is calculated using current prices. Real GDP, however, remains unchanged as it reflects the actual quantity of goods and services produced, independent of price changes.

Answer: D
