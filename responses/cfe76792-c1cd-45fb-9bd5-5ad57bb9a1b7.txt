Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

You are in your laboratory late one night, working with eight separate containers holding the flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum. Three of the containers hold beetles homozygous for ebony bodies. The remaining five containers hold beetles homozygous for red bodies. Suddenly, the lights in your lab go out. You decide to remove your beetles to another lab so you can continue your work. If you can carry only one container at a time, what is the probability that the first container you select in the darkness contains homozygous ebony beetles and the second container contains homozygous red?

Options:

A: 0.438
B: 0.178
C: 0.358
D: 0.125
E: 0.375
F: 0.268
G: 0.525
H: 0.488
I: 0.225
J: 0.625

Okay, so I've got this probability problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the setup: There are eight containers in the lab. Three of them have flour beetles that are homozygous for ebony bodies, and the other five are homozygous for red bodies. I need to find the probability that when I select two containers in the dark (one after another), the first one is an ebony container and the second one is a red container. And I can only carry one container at a time, so I'm picking them one by one without replacement.

Wait, but the problem says I need to select two containers in sequence without replacement because I can only carry one at a time. So the first pick is for the first container, and the second pick is for the second container, but they are separate events. So the total number of containers is 8, with 3 ebony (E) and 5 red (R).

First, I think I should calculate the probability of picking an ebony container first, then a red container. Since these are dependent events (because once I pick one container, it's no longer available), I'll need to adjust the probabilities accordingly.

So, the probability of the first container being E is the number of E containers divided by the total number of containers. That would be 3/8. 

Now, after picking one E container, there are now 7 containers left. But the number of E containers is now 2, and the red ones remain at 5. So the probability of picking a red container next is 5/7.

To find the combined probability of both events happening in sequence (first E, then R), I multiply the probabilities of each individual event. So that's (3/8) multiplied by (5/7).

Let me calculate that: 3 divided by 8 is 0.375, and 5 divided by 7 is approximately 0.7142857. Multiplying these together: 0.375 * 0.7142857 ≈ 0.2678571. 

Hmm, looking at the options, I see option F is 0.268, which seems to match this calculation. So I think the correct answer is F.

Wait a second, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So the first pick probability is 3/8, correct. Then after removing one E, the next pick has 5 R out of 7. Yes, that's right. Multiplying them gives 15/56. Let me compute that as a decimal: 15 ÷ 56 equals approximately 0.267857, which rounds to 0.268. Yep, that's F.

I don't think I made any mistakes in the steps. Initially, I thought maybe it's 3/8 times 5/7, which is exactly what I did. So I'm confident that F is the right choice.

The probability of selecting an ebony container first is 3/8, and then selecting a red container is 5/7. Multiplying these gives 15/56 ≈ 0.268.

Answer: F
