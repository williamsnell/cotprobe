Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the boiling and freezing points of a solution made by dissolving 10.0 grams of urea in 200 grams of water. Hmm, I remember that this involves colligative properties, which depend on the number of particles in the solution. Urea is a non-electrolyte, so it won't dissociate in water, right? 

First, I think I should calculate the molality of the solution. Molality is moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. The solute here is urea, and the solvent is water. 

The molecular weight of urea, CO(NH2)2, is calculated as follows: Carbon is 12, Oxygen is 16, each Nitrogen is 14, and each Hydrogen is 1. So, 12 + 16 + 2*(14 + 2*1) = 12 + 16 + 2*(16) = 12 +16 +32 = 60 g/mol. Wait, let me double-check that. Carbon is 12, O is 16, each NH2 has one N (14) and two H (2), so two NH2 groups would be 2*(14 + 2) = 32. So total is 12 +16 +32 = 60 g/mol. Yep, that's right.

So, moles of urea = mass / molar mass = 10.0 g / 60 g/mol = 0.166666... mol, approximately 0.1667 mol.

The solvent is 200 grams of water, so in kg that's 0.2 kg. So molality (m) is 0.1667 mol / 0.2 kg = 0.8333 m.

Now, for colligative properties, the formula for boiling point elevation is ΔTb = Kb * m, and for freezing point depression, ΔTf = Kf * m. 

I remember that water has Kb = 0.512°C·kg/mol and Kf = 1.86°C·kg/mol. These are the constants for boiling and freezing point changes, respectively.

So, let's calculate ΔTb first. ΔTb = 0.512 * 0.8333 ≈ 0.512 * 0.8333. Let me compute that: 0.512 * 0.8 is 0.4096, and 0.512 * 0.0333 is about 0.017. So adding them gives roughly 0.4266°C. Wait, maybe I should do it more accurately. 0.8333 * 0.512. Let me compute 0.8*0.512=0.4096, 0.0333*0.512≈0.0170. So total is 0.4096 + 0.0170 ≈ 0.4266°C. So the boiling point is 100°C + 0.4266 ≈ 100.4266°C, which is approximately 100.43°C.

For the freezing point depression, ΔTf = 1.86 * 0.8333. Let me calculate that: 1.86 * 0.8 = 1.488, and 1.86 * 0.0333 ≈ 0.06198. Adding them gives about 1.55°C. So the freezing point would be 0°C - 1.55°C = -1.55°C.

Wait, but I'm looking at the options. Let me check the options. Looking at the options, option H is Boiling point 100.43°C, Freezing point -1.55°C. Option H is one of the choices. Let me see the options again.

Option H: Boiling point is 100.43°C, Freezing point is -1.55°C. That matches what I calculated. But wait, I should double-check my molality calculation. 10 grams of urea, 60 g/mol, so 10/60 = 1/6 ≈0.1667 mol. Divided by 0.2 kg gives 0.8333 m. So that's correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the freezing point might be positive or negative. Oh, no, freezing point depression is a lowering, so it's 0°C minus the depression, so if ΔTf is 1.55, the freezing point is -1.55°C. So that's correct.

Looking back at the options:

Option E: Bp 100.43, Fp 1.55 → No, that's not right because freezing point should be lower.

Option H: Bp 100.43, Fp -1.55 → Yes, that's what I got.

Option F: Bp 99.57, Fp -1.55 → Wait, where does 99.57 come from? Let me check the boiling point calculation again. Kb is 0.512, m is 0.8333.

0.512 * 0.8333 = let me compute it more accurately. 0.512 * (5/6) because 0.8333 is 5/6. 0.512 * 5 = 2.56, divided by 6 is 0.426666... So 100.426666... which is approximately 100.43, so option H's boiling point is correct.

So the correct answer should be option H: Boiling point is 100.43°C, Freezing point is -1.55°C.

The problem involves determining the boiling and freezing points of a solution made by dissolving 10.0 grams of urea (CO(NH₂)₂) in 200 grams of water. Urea is a non-electrolyte, so it does not dissociate in water. 

First, the molar mass of urea is calculated as 60 g/mol. The number of moles of urea is then:

\[
\text{Moles of urea} = \frac{10.0 \, \text{g}}{60 \, \text{g/mol}} = 0.1667 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The molality (\(m\)) of the solution is:

\[
m = \frac{0.1667 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{kg}} = 0.8333 \, \text{mol/kg}.
\]

Using the boiling point elevation formula (\(ΔT_b = K_b \cdot m\)) and the freezing point depression formula (\(ΔT_f = K_f \cdot m\)), where \(K_b = 0.512 \, \text{°C·kg/mol}\) and \(K_f = 1.86 \, \text{°C·kg/mol}\) for water:

\[
ΔT_b = 0.512 \cdot 0.8333 \approx 0.4267 \, \text{°C},
\]
\[
ΔT_f = 1.86 \cdot 0.8333 \approx 1.55 \, \text{°C}.
\]

The boiling point is:

\[
100.0 \, \text{°C} + 0.4267 \, \text{°C} \approx 100.43 \, \text{°C},
\]

and the freezing point is:

\[
0.0 \, \text{°C} - 1.55 \, \text{°C} = -1.55 \, \text{°C}.
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**H: Boiling point is 100.43°C, Freezing point is -1.55°C.**
