Okay, so I have this physics problem about wave transmission between two media. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my optics, but I'll try to remember what I know.

The question says that polystyrene has a relative permittivity (I think that's the same as the dielectric constant, εr) of 2.7. A wave is incident at an angle θ_i = 30° from air onto polystyrene. I need to find the transmission angle θ_t. Then, I have to interchange polystyrene and air and do the calculation again. The options are provided, so I can check my answers against them.

Wait, wait. I remember that when a wave goes from one medium to another, the transmission (refraction) angle depends on the refractive indices of the two media. Oh, right, Snell's Law: n1*sinθ1 = n2*sinθ2. But wait, Snell's Law is usually for when the wave is going from medium 1 to medium 2, right?

First, I need to find the refractive indices. Air has a relative permittivity (εr) of approximately 1.0. Polystyrene's εr is 2.7. Hmm, how does the relative permittivity relate to the refractive index? Oh, right, the refractive index n is the square root of the relative permittivity when the relative permeability μr is 1 (which it is for most non-magnetic materials like air and polystyrene). So n = sqrt(εr). 

So, for air, n_air = sqrt(1) = 1. For polystyrene, n_polystyrene = sqrt(2.7) ≈ let me calculate that. The square of 1.6 is 2.56, and 1.62^2 is about 2.62, 1.64^2 is around 2.69, so 1.64^2 is 2.69. Hmm, wait, 2.7 is a bit higher. Let me compute sqrt(2.7) more accurately. 

Alternatively, I can approximate it. Let's see: 1.64^2 = (1.6 + 0.04)^2 = 1.6² + 2*1.6*0.04 + 0.04² = 2.56 + 0.128 + 0.0016 = 2.6896. So 1.64^2 is approximately 2.6896, which is just under 2.7. So about 1.6405, maybe? Let me check with a calculator. 

Wait, maybe I can just use a calculator in my mind. Let me think: 1.64^2 = 2.6896, as above. 1.6405^2: Let me compute (1.64 + 0.0005)^2 = 1.64² + 2*1.64*0.0005 + (0.0005)^2 = 2.6896 + 0.00164 + 0.00000025 ≈ 2.69124. Hmm, but 2.7 is higher. So maybe 1.6405 isn't enough. Let's try 1.641^2: 1.64^2 is 2.6896, now adding (0.001)^2 and 2*(1.64)*(0.001). Wait, maybe I should just calculate 1.640^2 = 2.6896, as before. So 1.640^2 = 2.6896, and 1.641^2 = (1.64 + 0.001)^2 = 1.64² + 2*1.64*0.001 + 0.001² ≈ 2.6896 + 0.00328 + 0.000001 ≈ 2.692881. Still less than 2.7. So 1.642^2 would be 2.692881 + 2*1.641*0.001 (approx) + (0.001)^2. Wait, maybe it's easier to just note that sqrt(2.7) is approximately 1.643. Let me just go with n_polystyrene ≈ 1.643.

Wait, but maybe for the sake of this problem, the exact value isn't critical; perhaps the options are based on an approximate calculation. So n_air = 1, n_polystyrene = sqrt(2.7) ≈ 1.643.

So, first scenario: wave from air (n1=1) to polystyrene (n2=1.643) at θ_i = 30°. Applying Snell's Law: n1*sinθ_i = n2*sinθ_t.

So, sinθ_t = (n1/n2)*sinθ_i = (1/1.643)*sin(30°).

Sin(30°) is 0.5, so (1/1.643)*0.5 ≈ (0.5)/(1.643) ≈ 0.304.

So θ_t ≈ arcsin(0.304). Let me think: sin(18°) is about 0.309, which is close to 0.304. Wait, no, wait: 18 degrees is about 0.309. So 0.304 is slightly less than that. Hmm. Let me check: sin(17°) is around 0.2924, and sin(18°) is 0.3090. So 0.304 is between 17 and 18 degrees. Let's approximate it as ~17.5 degrees. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. Let's do a linear approximation between 17 and 18 degrees.

At 17°, sin=0.2924; at 18°, sin=0.3090. The difference between 17° and 18° is 1 degree, and the increase is 0.3090 - 0.2924 = 0.0166.

We have 0.304 - 0.2924 = 0.0116. So 0.0116 / 0.0166 ≈ 0.7. So approximately 17° + 0.7° ≈ 17.7°. So θ_t ≈ 17.7 degrees.

Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I should use a calculator. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the small angle approximation, but maybe that's not necessary here. Alternatively, perhaps I can accept that the angle is approximately 17.7 degrees.

Now, the first part of the question: When the wave goes from air to polystyrene, the transmission angle is approximately 17.7 degrees.

Now, the second part: interchange polystyrene and air, so the wave is now going from polystyrene (n2=1.643) to air (n1=1). So we have to find the angle of transmission (which, in this case, would be the angle when going from polystyrene to air, so it's the same as the angle of incidence in the reverse case).

Wait a second, I think I might have gotten confused. Let me think: when the wave is incident from air to polystyrene, the angle inside polystyrene is θ_t. When we interchange, the wave is incident from polystyrene to air. So in this second case, the incident medium is polystyrene (n2=1.643), and the transmitted medium is air (n1=1). So in this case, the angle of incidence is still θ_i=30°, but now it's in polystyrene, so the wave is going into air.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify: in the first case, the wave is incident from air (n1=1) to polystyrene (n2=1.643) at 30 degrees in air. So the transmitted angle is θ_t in polystyrene.

In the second case, the wave is incident from polystyrene (n1=1.643) to air (n2=1) at the same angle θ_i=30°, but this time θ_i is the angle inside polystyrene. So when it transmits into air, the angle θ_t would be in air.

Wait, but maybe I'm mixing up the media. Let me think again: When you switch the media, the incident medium changes. So in the second case, n1 is polystyrene (1.643), n2 is air (1). The incident angle is θ_i=30°, which is now in polystyrene. So the transmitted angle would be in air. So applying Snell's Law again: n1*sinθ_i = n2*sinθ_t.

So, sinθ_t = (n1/n2) * sinθ_i = (1.643/1) * sin(30°) = 1.643 * 0.5 = 0.8215.

So θ_t = arcsin(0.8215). Let me think: sin(55°) is about 0.8192, and sin(56°) is about 0.8290. So 0.8215 is between 55 and 56 degrees. Let's approximate it. The difference between 55 and 56 is 1 degree, and the sine increases by ~0.01 (from 0.8192 to 0.8290). 0.8215 is 0.8215 - 0.8192 = 0.0023 above 0.8192. So that's about 0.0023/0.01 = 0.23 of the way from 55 to 56 degrees. So approximately 55.23 degrees, which rounds to about 55.2 degrees.

Wait, but wait a second: I think I might have made a mistake here. Because when going from a higher refractive index medium to a lower one, the transmitted angle is larger than the incident angle. Wait, no, no: when you go from higher to lower, the transmitted angle is larger than the incident angle. Wait, but in this case, the incident angle is 30 degrees in polystyrene (n=1.643), and when it transmits into air (n=1), the angle should be larger than 30 degrees. Wait, but according to the calculation, it's about 55.2 degrees, which is indeed larger than 30. So that makes sense.

Wait, but let me check the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, n1=1.643, θ_i=30°, n2=1.

So sinθ_t = (1.643/1) * sin(30°) = 1.643 * 0.5 = 0.8215. So θ_t = arcsin(0.8215) ≈ 55.2 degrees, yes.

Wait, but wait another thing: I'm trying to find the transmitted angle when going from polystyrene to air. So the transmitted angle is in air, and it's larger than the incident angle in polystyrene. That makes sense.

So putting it all together: when going from air to polystyrene, θ_t is approximately 17.7 degrees, and when going from polystyrene to air, θ_t is approximately 55.2 degrees.

Looking at the options:

Option F is 17.7 degrees and 55.2 degrees. So that's the one.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option F says: 17.7 degrees and 55.2 degrees. Yes, that matches. So the correct answer should be F.

When a wave is incident from air (n₁ = 1) to polystyrene (n₂ = √2.7 ≈ 1.643) at an angle of θ₁ = 30°, Snell's Law applies:  
\[ n₁ \sinθ₁ = n₂ \sinθ₂ \].  
Substituting the values:  
\[ \sinθ₂ = \frac{n₁}{n₂} \sinθ₁ = \frac{1}{1.643} \sin(30°) = \frac{0.5}{1.643} ≈ 0.304 \].  
Thus, \( θ₂ ≈ \arcsin(0.304) ≈ 17.7° \).

When the wave is incident from polystyrene (n₁ = 1.643) to air (n₂ = 1) at the same angle of θ₁ = 30°, Snell's Law again applies:  
\[ n₁ \sinθ₁ = n₂ \sinθ₂ \].  
Substituting the values:  
\[ \sinθ₂ = \frac{n₁}{n₂} \sinθ₁ = \frac{1.643}{1} \sin(30°) = 1.643 \cdot 0.5 = 0.8215 \].  
Thus, \( θ₂ ≈ \arcsin(0.8215) ≈ 55.2° \).

The angles are approximately **17.7°** and **55.2°**, which matches **Option F**.
