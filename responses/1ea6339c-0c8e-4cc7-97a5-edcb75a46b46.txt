Okay, so I have this question about Lukianoff and Haidt's argument regarding trigger warnings and the type of pathological thinking they involve. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that they wrote about this in their book "The Coddling of the American Mind." 

First, I need to recall what each of these pathological thinking terms means. Let me think: fortune-telling is when someone predicts negative outcomes with no evidence, like assuming the worst will happen. Blaming involves holding others responsible for your problems, maybe assigning fault where it's not clear. Dichotomous thinking is seeing things in extremes, like black-and-white, no shades of gray. Resentment is lingering anger over a wrong perceived to have been suffered.

I remember that Lukianoff and Haidt discuss how trigger warnings can lead to certain cognitive distortions. Trigger warnings are meant to alert people to potentially distressing material, but they argue that overuse can have negative effects on students' thinking patterns.

In their argument, they probably tie trigger warnings to a specific cognitive distortion. Dichotomous thinking comes to mind because it's about seeing things in extremes. If someone is always on the lookout for triggers, they might see the world as either safe or dangerous, good or bad, without considering middle ground. This could lead to avoiding more experiences than necessary and limiting their exposure to new ideas, which they might perceive as threats.

Alternatively, could it be fortune-telling? That would involve expecting the worst to happen. Maybe if someone expects that any discussion will be triggering, they might predict negative outcomes, but I'm not sure if that's the main point they make.

Blaming could fit if they argue that trigger warnings encourage assigning blame to others for causing distress, but I don't recall that being the focus. Resentment seems less likely because it's about anger, not so much about the way people think in extremes.

I think the key here is that dichotomous thinking leads people to view situations as either entirely safe or entirely unsafe, which could be what trigger warnings exacerbate. They might start to avoid any situation that isn't completely safe, leading to a more rigid way of thinking.

Lukianoff and Haidt argue that trigger warnings can lead to dichotomous thinking, where individuals view situations as entirely safe or entirely unsafe, leading to rigid and limiting perspectives.
