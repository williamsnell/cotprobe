Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The equation given is X = AX + bu, and X(0) = X0. The matrices A and b are given, along with X0, and u(t) is the impulse function δ(t). I need to find the solution and choose the correct option from A to J.

First, let me write down the given matrices. A is a 2x2 matrix:

A = |1 0|
    |2 0|

And b is a 2x1 matrix:

b = |1|
    |1|

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. The problem says A is "vert10vert", which I think is a vertical way of writing a matrix. So A might be:

A = [1 0;
     2 0]

Similarly, b is given as "vert1vert", which would be [1; 1], right? So b is a 2x1 vector with both elements as 1.

X0 is given as "vert-1vert" and "vert-22vert". Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse that. The problem says X0 = "vert-1vert, vert-22vert". Oh, maybe X0 is a vector with two elements: -1 and -22? Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Wait, no—the way it's written might be that X0 is a vector with two rows. Let me re-express that.

X0 is written as "vert-1vert; vert-22vert", which I think is a column vector with two elements: -1 and -22. So X0 = [ -1; -22 ].

Wait, but that doesn't seem to match the dimensions. Because A is 2x2, so if X is a state vector, it's 2x1. So the initial condition X(0) = X0 should be a 2x1 vector. So X0 is [ -1; -22 ].

Wait, but looking at the options, the possible answers are single numbers, not vectors. Hmm. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read the question again.

The equation is X = AX + bu, with X(0)=X0. So this is a differential equation, probably in the context of linear systems. Since u(t) is the impulse function δ(t), we're dealing with a system response to an impulse.

The equation might actually be the state equation, so perhaps it's written as X' = AX + bu, where X' is the derivative of X with respect to time. Because in control systems, the state equation is often written as X' = AX + bu.

Assuming that, then the solution to X' = AX + bu with X(0) = X0 would involve finding the state transition matrix. Since u(t) is δ(t), the solution is X(t) = e^(At) X0 + e^(At) b * δ(t), integrated over t. But because δ(t) is an impulse, the integral simplifies. Alternatively, the solution can be found using the convolution integral, but for an impulse input, the output is e^(At) multiplied by the initial condition plus the integral of e^(A(t-τ)) b δ(τ) dτ, which simplifies to e^(At) b.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The general solution for X(t) when the input is δ(t) is X(t) = e^(At) X0 + e^(At) b. Because the impulse response is e^(At) b, and the homogeneous solution is e^(At) X0.

Wait, but in this case, since the input is an impulse at t=0, the solution would be X(t) = e^(At) X0 + e^(At) b, but actually, when you have an impulse input, the solution is the homogeneous solution plus the impulse response. Alternatively, since the system's response to an impulse is the state transition matrix at time t multiplied by the input, which for δ(t) is just the state transition matrix at t multiplied by b. So the overall solution would be X(t) = e^(At) X0 + e^(At) b.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach it step by step.

First, the system equation is X' = AX + bu, with X(0) = X0, and u(t) = δ(t). So the solution is X(t) = e^(At) X0 + ∫ e^(A(t-τ)) b δ(τ) dτ from 0 to t. The integral simplifies because δ(τ) is zero everywhere except at τ=0, so the integral becomes e^(At) b evaluated at τ=0, which is e^(At) b.

Wait, no, more accurately, the integral of e^(A(t-τ)) b δ(τ) dτ from 0 to t is e^(At) multiplied by the integral of e^(-A τ) b δ(τ) dτ. Because e^(A(t-τ)) = e^(At) e^(-A τ). So the integral becomes e^(At) ∫ e^(-A τ) b δ(τ) dτ. The integral ∫ e^(-A τ) b δ(τ) dτ is just e^(0) b, because δ(τ) is zero except at τ=0. So ∫ e^(-A τ) b δ(τ) dτ = b. So the entire integral becomes e^(At) b.

So the solution is X(t) = e^(At) X0 + e^(At) b. Wait, but wait, that doesn't seem right. Because when u(t) is δ(t), the forcing term is e^(At) b. So the total solution is X(t) = e^(At) X0 + e^(At) b. But wait, that would be the case if the integral was from -infty to t, but since the system starts at t=0, X(0) is X0. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the limits.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct solution is X(t) = e^(At) X0 + e^(At) b, because the impulse response is e^(At) b.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The general solution when u(t) is an impulse is X(t) = e^(At) X0 + e^(At) b. Because the homogeneous solution is e^(At) X0, and the particular solution due to the impulse is e^(At) b.

But wait, let's test this at t=0. X(0) should be X0, right? So substituting t=0 into X(t) = e^(A*0) X0 + e^(A*0) b = X0 + b. But X(0) is given as X0, so that would imply that X0 + b = X0, which would require b to be zero, which it's not. So that suggests that my initial approach is incorrect.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the integral limits. Let me try again.

The standard solution for X(t) when u(t) is δ(t) is:

X(t) = e^(At) X0 + ∫_{0}^{t} e^(A(t-τ)) b δ(τ) dτ.

Because the input is applied from τ=0 onwards. So the integral becomes e^(At) ∫_{0}^{t} e^(-A τ) b δ(τ) dτ. Now, the integral ∫_{0}^{t} e^(-A τ) b δ(τ) dτ is equal to e^(-A*0) b, which is b, because δ(τ) is zero except at τ=0, so the integral picks up the value at τ=0. So the integral is b. Therefore, the solution is X(t) = e^(At) X0 + e^(At) b.

But wait, when t=0, X(0) = e^(A*0) X0 + e^(A*0) b = X0 + b, but according to the problem, X(0) is X0, so this suggests that X0 + b must equal X0, which would mean b is zero, which it's not. So I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the correct integral is from τ=-infty to t, but in the problem, the system starts at t=0, so the input is applied at t=0. Maybe the integral should be from τ=0 to t, but then at τ=0, the delta function is zero except at τ=0. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct solution is that the impulse response is e^(At) b, and the total solution is X(t) = e^(At) X0 + e^(At) b. But at t=0, that would imply X(0) = X0 + b, which contradicts the initial condition X(0) = X0. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the system's response. Let me think differently. The system equation is X' = AX + bu, with X(0) = X0 and u(t) = δ(t). So the solution is X(t) = e^(At) X0 + e^(At) ∫_{0}^{t} e^(-A τ) b δ(τ) dτ.

Let me compute the integral. Since the integral is ∫_{0}^{t} e^(-A τ) b δ(τ) dτ, and δ(τ) is only non-zero at τ=0, the integral becomes e^(-A*0) b * ∫ δ(τ) dτ = b * 1 = b. So the solution is X(t) = e^(At) X0 + e^(At) b.

But again, at t=0, X(0) = X0 + b, which contradicts the initial condition. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in setting up the integral.

Wait, perhaps the correct expression is X(t) = e^(At) X0 + ∫_{0}^{t} e^(A(t - τ)) b δ(τ) dτ. Let me compute this correctly.

The term inside the integral is e^(A(t - τ)) b δ(τ). The integral from 0 to t of that is [e^(A(t - τ)) b ] evaluated at τ=0, multiplied by the integral of δ(τ) dτ from 0 to t. Since δ(τ) is zero except at τ=0, the integral becomes e^(A(t - 0)) b * 1 = e^(At) b.

So the solution is X(t) = e^(At) X0 + e^(At) b.

But again, at t=0, X(0) = X0 + b, which can't be right because X(0) is given as X0. So I must have made an error in the setup.

Wait a second, perhaps I should consider the system's response to the impulse. The homogeneous solution is e^(At) X0, and the particular solution due to the impulse is e^(At) b. But wait, when t=0, the particular solution would be b, so the total solution would be e^(At) X0 + e^(At) b. But this would imply X(0) = X0 + b, which contradicts X(0) = X0. So maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the particular solution is zero and the homogeneous solution is e^(At) X0. But then where does the impulse come in?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of Laplace transforms. Taking the Laplace transform of both sides:

s X(s) = A X(s) + b U(s)

Where U(s) is the Laplace transform of δ(t), which is 1. So:

s X(s) = A X(s) + b

Rearranging:

(sI - A) X(s) = b

So X(s) = (sI - A)^-1 b

Then, taking the inverse Laplace transform gives X(t) = e^(At) b, which is the impulse response. But this is only the particular solution. The homogeneous solution would involve e^(At) X0, but the initial condition is X(0) = X0. So when t=0, X(0) = X0 = X0 + 0, which suggests that the impulse response is separate from the homogeneous solution. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the system's response to the impulse is the impulse response, which is e^(At) b. And the homogeneous solution is e^(At) X0. So the total solution is X(t) = e^(At) X0 + e^(At) b. But as before, this would imply X(0) = X0 + b, which contradicts the initial condition. So I must be making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is that the system's equation is X' = AX + bu, and with u(t) = δ(t), the solution is X(t) = e^(At) X0 + e^(At) b. But again, this leads to the same issue at t=0.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to compute e^(At) first.

Given A = [1 0; 2 0], let's compute its eigenvalues and eigenvectors to find e^(At).

The characteristic equation is det(A - λI) = 0.

So |1-λ  0    |
   |2    -λ   | = (1-λ)(-λ) - 0 = λ(λ - 1) = 0.

So eigenvalues are λ = 0 and λ = 1.

For λ=1:

(A - I) = [0 0; 2 -1]

So the system of equations is 0*x + 0*y = 0 and 2x - y = 0. So the eigenvector can be [1; 2].

For λ=0:

(A - 0I) = A = [1 0; 2 0]

The equations are x + 0*y = 0 and 2x + 0*y = 0. So x=0, y is free. So eigenvector is [0; 1].

Now, we can express A in terms of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Let me construct the matrix P whose columns are the eigenvectors:

P = [1 0; 2 1]

Then P^{-1} would be 1/(det P) * [1 -0; -2 1]. The determinant of P is (1)(1) - (0)(2) = 1. So P^{-1} = [1 0; -2 1].

So A can be written as P D P^{-1}, where D is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues [1 0; 0 0].

Therefore, e^(At) = P e^(D t) P^{-1}.

e^(D t) is diag(e^t, e^0) = diag(e^t, 1).

So e^(At) = P * diag(e^t, 1) * P^{-1}.

Let me compute this.

P = [1 0; 2 1]

diag(e^t, 1) = [e^t 0; 0 1]

P^{-1} = [1 0; -2 1]

So e^(At) = [1 0; 2 1] * [e^t 0; 0 1] * [1 0; -2 1].

First, multiply the first two matrices:

[1*e^t + 0*0, 1*0 + 0*1; 2*e^t + 1*0, 2*0 + 1*1] = [e^t 0; 2e^t 1]

Then multiply by P^{-1}:

[e^t 0; 2e^t 1] * [1 0; -2 1] = 

First row:

e^t * 1 + 0*(-2) = e^t
e^t * 0 + 0*1 = 0

Second row:

2e^t *1 + 1*(-2) = 2e^t - 2
2e^t *0 + 1*1 = 1

So e^(At) = [e^t      0     ]
          [2e^t - 2   1    ]

Wait, let me double-check that multiplication:

First, the multiplication of the two matrices [e^t 0; 2e^t 1] and [1 0; -2 1].

Element (1,1): e^t *1 + 0*(-2) = e^t
Element (1,2): e^t *0 + 0*1 = 0
Element (2,1): 2e^t *1 + 1*(-2) = 2e^t -2
Element (2,2): 2e^t *0 + 1*1 = 1

Yes, that's correct.

So e^(At) is:

[ e^t        0        ]
[2e^t - 2    1       ]

Now, let's compute X(t) = e^(At) X0 + e^(At) b.

Wait, but earlier we had a problem with the initial condition. Let me try this approach.

Given X(t) = e^(At) X0 + e^(At) b, but at t=0, e^(A*0) is I, so X(0) would be X0 + b, which contradicts the initial condition. So perhaps the correct solution is X(t) = e^(At) X0 + ∫_{0}^{t} e^(A(t - τ)) b δ(τ) dτ.

Which simplifies to X(t) = e^(At) X0 + e^(At) b, because the integral becomes e^(At) b.

But this leads to X(0) = X0 + b, which isn't correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should model the system as X' = AX + bu, and the impulse response is e^(At) b, and the homogeneous solution is e^(At) X0. But then X(t) = e^(At) X0 + e^(At) b would be the solution, but at t=0, that would be X0 + b, which isn't correct. Therefore, perhaps the correct solution is only the homogeneous solution, but that can't be right because the system is driven by an impulse.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should compute the solution step by step using the matrices.

Given X' = AX + bu, with u(t)=δ(t), X(0)=X0.

We can write the solution as X(t) = e^(At) X0 + ∫_{0}^{t} e^(A(t - τ)) b δ(τ) dτ.

As before, the integral becomes e^(At) b, because δ(τ) picks out the value at τ=0.

So X(t) = e^(At) X0 + e^(At) b.

But as before, at t=0, this gives X0 + b, which contradicts X(0)=X0. So perhaps I'm missing something in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the correct solution is X(t) = e^(At) X0 + e^(At) b * H(t), where H(t) is the Heaviside step function. But that still wouldn't fix the initial condition.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct solution is that the homogeneous solution is X_h(t) = e^(At) X0, and the particular solution due to the impulse is X_p(t) = e^(At) b. So the total solution is X(t) = X_h(t) + X_p(t).

But at t=0, X(0) = X0 + b, which contradicts the initial condition. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the impulse response is the solution when X0 is zero. So if X0 is zero, then X(t) = e^(At) b. But in this problem, X0 is not zero, so the total solution is X(t) = e^(At) X0 + e^(At) b.

But again, this leads to a problem with the initial condition.

Wait a second, perhaps the system equation is written as X' = AX + bu, and u(t) is δ(t). So the solution should be X(t) = e^(At) X0 + e^(At) b. But that would mean that at t=0, X(0) = X0 + b, which can't be correct. So perhaps the correct solution is only the homogeneous part, but that doesn't account for the impulse.

I'm clearly missing something here. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I should compute the solution step by step.

First, let's compute e^(At) X0 and e^(At) b.

Given e^(At) as computed earlier:

e^(At) = [e^t      0      ]
         [2e^t - 2   1     ]

X0 is [ -1; -22 ]

So e^(At) X0 is:

First component: e^t * (-1) + 0 * (-22) = -e^t

Second component: (2e^t - 2) * (-1) + 1 * (-22) = -2e^t + 2 -22 = -2e^t -20

Now, compute e^(At) b:

b is [1; 1]

So e^(At) b is:

First component: e^t *1 + 0 *1 = e^t

Second component: (2e^t -2)*1 + 1*1 = 2e^t -2 +1 = 2e^t -1

So the total solution X(t) = e^(At) X0 + e^(At) b would be:

First component: (-e^t) + e^t = 0

Second component: (-2e^t -20) + (2e^t -1) = (-2e^t + 2e^t) + (-20 -1) = 0 -21 = -21

Wait, that's interesting. The first component cancels out, leaving X(t) = [0; -21]. But the options given don't include -21. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, but perhaps the solution is only the homogeneous part, without adding e^(At) b. Because if I only take X(t) = e^(At) X0, then:

First component: -e^t

Second component: -2e^t -20

At t=0, that gives [-1; -22], which matches X0. But then where is the impulse response?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct solution is X(t) = e^(At) X0 + e^(At) b * δ(t). But δ(t) is zero except at t=0, which would make the solution X(t) = e^(At) X0 for t>0, but that doesn't make sense because the impulse should affect the system.

I'm clearly getting stuck here. Let me try another approach. Since the system is linear and time-invariant, the response to δ(t) is the impulse response, which is e^(At) b. So the total solution should be X(t) = e^(At) X0 + e^(At) b.

But earlier calculation gives X(t) = [0; -21], which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating e^(At) X0 and e^(At) b.

Wait, let me re-calculate e^(At) X0.

e^(At) = [e^t  0; 2e^t -2  1]

X0 = [-1; -22]

So e^(At) X0 = [e^t*(-1) + 0*(-22); (2e^t -2)*(-1) + 1*(-22)]

= [ -e^t; -2e^t +2 -22 ]

= [ -e^t; -2e^t -20 ]

Similarly, e^(At) b:

b = [1; 1]

So e^(At) b = [e^t*1 + 0*1; (2e^t -2)*1 + 1*1 ]

= [e^t; 2e^t -2 +1 ]

= [e^t; 2e^t -1 ]

Adding these together:

X(t) = [ -e^t + e^t; (-2e^t -20) + (2e^t -1) ]

= [0; (-2e^t + 2e^t) + (-20 -1) ]

= [0; 0 -21 ]

= [0; -21 ]

But the options don't have -21. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the correct solution is that the system's response is only the homogeneous solution, but that doesn't make sense because the impulse should add a particular solution.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find X(0+), the state right after the impulse. Because when you apply an impulse at t=0, the state jumps. So X(0+) = X(0) + e^(A*0) b = X0 + b.

So X(0+) would be:

X0 = [-1; -22]

b = [1; 1]

So X(0+) = [-1 +1; -22 +1] = [0; -21]

But again, the options don't include -21. So perhaps the question is asking for the value at t=0, but that's given as X0.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the value after the impulse, i.e., the jump in the state. But the options don't include [0; -21].

Wait, looking back at the options, the choices are single numbers, but the problem seems to involve a vector. So perhaps I've misunderstood the problem.

Wait, the problem says X = AX + bu. Maybe it's a scalar equation, not a vector. Let me check the original problem again.

The user wrote:

"A=\vert10\vert,b=\vert1\vert,X_0 =\vert- 1\vert, \vert- 22\vert\vert2\vert\vert0\vert u(t) = \delta(t) (impulse function)."

Hmmm, perhaps the formatting is off. Let me parse this again.

A is written as "vert10vert", which I think is a matrix:

A = [1 0; 2 0]

Similarly, b is "vert1vert", which is [1; 1].

X0 is "vert-1vert; vert-22vert", which is [-1; -22].

Wait, but perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting, and A is a 1x2 matrix? Or perhaps it's a scalar equation. Wait, if A is 1x1, then it's just a scalar.

Wait, let me think again. If A is 1x1, then A = [1 0], which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps A is a 2x2 matrix as I thought earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a scalar equation, where A is 10, b is 1, and X0 is -1.

Wait, the problem says:

"A=\vert10\vert,b=\vert1\vert,X_0 =\vert- 1\vert, \vert- 22\vert\vert2\vert\vert0\vert u(t) = \delta(t) (impulse function)."

Maybe it's written as:

A is a 2x2 matrix:

A = [1 0;
     2 0]

b is a 2x1 vector:

b = [1;
      1]

X0 is a 2x1 vector:

X0 = [-1;
       -22]

But the options are single numbers, which suggests that perhaps the problem is scalar, not vector.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again.

The user wrote:

"A=\vert10\vert,b=\vert1\vert,X_0 =\vert- 1\vert, \vert- 22\vert\vert2\vert\vert0\vert u(t) = \delta(t) (impulse function)."

Hmm, perhaps it's intended to be:

A is a 2x2 matrix:

A = [1 0;
     2 0]

b is a 2x1 vector:

b = [1;
      1]

X0 is a 2x1 vector:

X0 = [-1;
       -22]

But the options are single numbers, so perhaps the problem is to find X1, the first component, or X2, the second component, or the sum, etc.

Wait, looking at the options, the possible answers are numbers like -3, 2, 0, etc. So perhaps the problem is to find the value of X at a certain time, but given that the system is linear and time-invariant, perhaps the steady-state value or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the value after the impulse, which is X(0+) = X0 + b, as we calculated earlier, which gives [0; -21]. But none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the value at t=0, which is X0, which is [-1; -22], but again, the options don't include that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the value of X at t approaching infinity. Let's see. As t approaches infinity, e^(At) will have terms depending on the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues are 0 and 1. So for λ=1, e^(λ t) tends to infinity, and for λ=0, e^(0 t) =1. So in the expression for e^(At), the terms with λ=1 will dominate.

Looking at e^(At) as t approaches infinity, the terms with e^t will dominate. So for the first component of e^(At) X0, it's -e^t, which tends to -infty. The second component is -2e^t -20, which also tends to -infty. But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the value of X(0+) which is [0; -21], but that's not in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a scalar equation. Let me assume that A, b, and X0 are scalars.

If A is 10, b is 1, X0 is -1, then the equation is X' = 10 X + u(t), with u(t)=δ(t), and X(0)=-1.

Then, the solution would involve finding X(t) = e^(10 t) X0 + e^(10 t) ∫ e^(-10 τ) b δ(τ) dτ.

Which simplifies to X(t) = e^(10 t) (-1) + e^(10 t) * 1, since the integral becomes 1.

So X(t) = e^(10 t) (-1 +1 ) = 0.

So the solution would be X(t) = 0 for t>0.

Thus, the answer would be 0, which is option C.

But wait, let me check this approach.

If the equation is X' = A X + b u(t), with X(0)=X0.

Taking Laplace transforms:

s X(s) = A X(s) + b U(s)

Since U(s) = 1 (because u(t)=δ(t)), we have:

s X(s) = A X(s) + b

Rearranged:

(s - A) X(s) = b

So X(s) = b / (s - A)

Inverse Laplace transform is X(t) = e^(A t) * (b / A) ?

Wait, no. The inverse Laplace of b/(s - A) is b e^(A t).

So X(t) = e^(A t) * (b / A) ?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The Laplace transform of e^(A t) is 1/(s - A). So if X(s) = b/(s - A), then X(t) = b e^(A t).

But wait, that can't be right because the initial condition is X(0) = X0. So perhaps the solution is X(t) = e^(A t) (X0 + b/(A)).

Wait, perhaps I should use the method of integrating factors. The equation is X' = A X + b δ(t).

The homogeneous solution is X_h = C e^(A t).

For the particular solution, since the input is δ(t), the particular solution would be a constant, say X_p.

Taking derivative, X_p' = 0 = A X_p + b δ(t). But that doesn't make sense because δ(t) is not zero everywhere except t=0.

Alternatively, perhaps the particular solution is X_p = K δ(t), but that might not be the right approach.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the Laplace transform approach correctly.

Taking Laplace transform:

s X(s) = A X(s) + b

So X(s) (s - A) = b

X(s) = b / (s - A)

Inverse Laplace is X(t) = b e^(A t)

But this doesn't account for the initial condition. So perhaps the correct solution is X(t) = e^(A t) (X0 + b/(A)).

Wait, because the homogeneous solution is X_h = C e^(A t), and the particular solution is X_p = b/(A). So combining:

X(t) = C e^(A t) + b/(A)

Applying initial condition X(0)=X0:

X0 = C + b/(A)

So C = X0 - b/(A)

Thus, X(t) = (X0 - b/(A)) e^(A t) + b/(A)

At t=0, this gives X0, which is correct.

Now, for the impulse response, perhaps the solution is X(t) = (X0 - b/A) e^(A t) + b/A.

But when t approaches infinity, the term (X0 - b/A) e^(A t) will dominate if A is positive, leading to infinity or negative infinity depending on the sign.

But the problem is to find the solution for X given the impulse. Perhaps the question is to find X(0+), the state right after the impulse. Let's compute that.

X(t) = (X0 - b/A) e^(A t) + b/A

At t=0+, e^(A*0) =1, so X(0+) = (X0 - b/A) *1 + b/A = X0.

Wait, that can't be right because the impulse should cause a jump. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is X(t) = e^(A t) (X0 + b δ(t)).

But I'm getting stuck again.

Wait, let's go back to the scalar case where A=10, b=1, X0=-1.

The equation is X' = 10 X + δ(t), X(0)=-1.

The solution would be X(t) = e^(10 t) [ X0 + ∫_{0}^{t} e^(-10 τ) δ(τ) dτ ]

The integral ∫ e^(-10 τ) δ(τ) dτ = e^0 =1.

So X(t) = e^(10 t) [ -1 +1 ] = 0.

So X(t)=0 for all t>0.

Thus, the solution is zero, which is option C.

But wait, in this case, the answer would be 0. Looking back at the options, option C is 0.

So perhaps the correct answer is C: 0.

The problem involves solving the differential equation \( X = AX + bu \) with the initial condition \( X(0) = X_0 \), where \( A \) is a matrix, \( b \) is a vector, \( X_0 \) is the initial state, and \( u(t) \) is the Dirac delta function. The goal is to find the solution for \( X \) at \( t = 0^+ \), the state immediately after the impulse.

### Key Steps:
1. **Matrix and Vector Definitions**:
   - \( A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 2 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \)
   - \( b = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \)
   - \( X_0 = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ -22 \end{bmatrix} \)

2. **Impulse Response**:
   The solution to the state equation \( X' = AX + bu \) with \( u(t) = \delta(t) \) involves the state transition matrix \( e^{At} \). The impulse response is given by \( e^{At}b \).

3. **State Transition Matrix**:
   The matrix \( e^{At} \) is computed using eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( A \). The eigenvalues are \( \lambda = 0 \) and \( \lambda = 1 \), leading to:
   \[
   e^{At} = \begin{bmatrix} e^t & 0 \\ 2e^t - 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
   \]

4. **Impulse Response Calculation**:
   The impulse response \( e^{At}b \) is computed as:
   \[
   e^{At}b = \begin{bmatrix} e^t \\ 2e^t - 1 \end{bmatrix}
   \]

5. **State at \( t = 0^+ \)**:
   The state immediately after the impulse is:
   \[
   X(0^+) = X_0 + e^{At}b \bigg|_{t=0} = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ -22 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ -21 \end{bmatrix}
   \]

6. **Scalar Interpretation**:
   If interpreting the problem as a scalar equation with \( A = 10 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( X_0 = -1 \), the solution simplifies to:
   \[
   X(t) = e^{10t}(-1 + 1) = 0
   \]
   This matches option **C: 0**.

### Conclusion:
The solution to the scalar interpretation of the problem is \( X(t) = 0 \), corresponding to option **C**.
