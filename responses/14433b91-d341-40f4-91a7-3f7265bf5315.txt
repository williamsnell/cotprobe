Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about "excess disability." I'm a bit new to this term, so I need to break it down. The question asks what excess disability refers to in terms of symptoms. Let me go through the options one by one to figure this out.

Option A says it's not due to the disease but to malignant social psychology. Hmm, I'm not sure about that. Malignant social psychology sounds complicated, and I don't immediately connect it with excess disability. Maybe it's more about how people perceive each other rather than symptoms related to a disease.

Option B mentions symptoms experienced only by individuals over a certain age. Well, some diseases do have age-related symptoms, but excess disability doesn't necessarily have to be age-specific. I don't think B is the right answer.

Option C says symptoms in excess of the average for that disorder. That sounds plausible. Excess disability would imply more than the usual level of disability for a given condition. I should keep this in mind.

Option D talks about symptoms as a side effect of treatment. That's more about adverse effects rather than the condition itself causing more symptoms. So D might not be the right fit.

Option E refers to symptoms not related to any disease but due to a mental disorder. That seems like it's talking about symptoms caused by something else, not necessarily excess disability related to a primary disease.

Option F says symptoms exacerbated by comorbid conditions. Comorbidity can definitely make symptoms worse, but is that the same as excess disability? I'm not sure. It might be a contributing factor but not the definition.

Option G suggests symptoms appear only after the disease is cured. That doesn't make sense because if the disease is cured, why would symptoms appear then? Maybe it's the opposite; sometimes symptoms can linger, but I don't think this is the standard definition.

Option H states symptoms only appear in chronic diseases. Excess disability could occur in chronic conditions, but it's not limited to them. So H might be too narrow.

Option I says symptoms can be successfully treated with medicine if caught early. While early treatment is good, this doesn't directly define excess disability. It's more about manageability.

Option J refers to symptoms found only in the last stage of Alzheimer's. That's too specific; excess disability isn't exclusive to Alzheimer's.

So, putting it all together. The key term is "excess," meaning more than the usual. Option C mentions symptoms in excess of the average for that disorder. That fits because excess disability would imply that the disability is beyond what's typically expected for the condition. The other options either don't fit the definition or are too specific or unrelated.

The correct answer is C: In excess of the average for that particular disorder.
