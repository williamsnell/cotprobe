Question:

A study is designed to evaluate the feasibility of acupuncture in children with chronic headaches. Sixty children with chronic headaches are recruited for the study. In addition to their usual therapy, all children are treated with acupuncture three times a week for 2 months. Which of the following best describes this study design?

Options:

A: Randomized control trial
B: Case-control
C: Case series
D: Crossover
E: Longitudinal
F: Meta-analysis
G: Cohort
H: Cross-sectional
I: Qualitative study
J: Systematic review

Okay, so I've got this question about a study design, and I need to figure out which option best describes it. Let me try to work through this step by step.

The question is about a study evaluating the feasibility of acupuncture in children with chronic headaches. They recruited 60 kids, and in addition to their usual therapy, all of them received acupuncture three times a week for two months. The question is asking what kind of study design this is, with options from A to J.

First, I should recall what each of these study designs entails. Let me list them out quickly:

A: Randomized control trial (RCT) – This is where participants are randomly assigned to either the treatment group or the control group. The gold standard for clinical trials.

B: Case-control – Compares people with a condition (cases) to those without (controls) to find associations.

C: Case series – A descriptive study of a group of patients with the same condition, observing outcomes over time.

D: Crossover – Participants receive both treatments in sequence, with a washout period in between. Each person serves as their own control.

E: Longitudinal – Observes the same subjects over a period of time, tracking changes.

F: Meta-analysis – A statistical review of multiple studies to combine their results.

G: Cohort – A group of people with a certain characteristic are observed over time to see how variables affect outcomes.

H: Cross-sectional – Data is collected from a population at a single point in time, often to assess prevalence.

I: Qualitative study – Focuses on understanding concepts, experiences, or phenomena through narrative data.

J: Systematic review – A comprehensive review of multiple studies to assess the state of research on a topic.

Now, looking at the study described: 60 children with chronic headaches are recruited. All of them are given acupuncture in addition to their usual therapy. The study's purpose is to evaluate feasibility. So, the key here is that all participants are receiving the same treatment—acupuncture plus their usual care.

Wait, but in a randomized control trial, you typically have a control group that doesn't receive the treatment. But in this case, everyone is getting acupuncture. That makes me think it's not an RCT because there's no control group. So option A might not be correct.

Another point is that the study is looking at feasibility, which might be a pilot study. But the options don't include pilot. So, perhaps it's best to think in terms of the design types given.

Since all participants are getting the intervention, there's no comparison group. That rules out RCT (A), case-control (B), crossover (D), and cohort (G) which typically involve some form of comparison.

Looking at the options, case series (C) is a possibility. A case series is when you observe a group of patients with the same condition over time without a control group. Here, the study is observing the effect of acupuncture in these 60 children, so it's descriptive without a control.

Alternatively, is it a longitudinal study (E)? Longitudinal studies track the same subjects over time, which this study does—treating them for two months and presumably assessing outcomes at various points. But the key aspect is the design without a control group.

Wait, but the study is evaluating the feasibility. Maybe it's a pilot or a pre-experimental design, but again, the options don't have those. So, the closest fit would be case series because it's a descriptive study of a group of patients receiving a treatment without a control group.

So, putting it together: the study design is a case series. That would be option C.

The study design described involves recruiting 60 children with chronic headaches who all receive acupuncture in addition to their usual therapy. Since there is no control group and the focus is on observing the outcomes of this treatment in the group, the study fits the description of a case series. 

Answer: C
