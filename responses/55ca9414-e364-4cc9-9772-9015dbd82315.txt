Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a gorilla climbing a tree, and I need to find the work done. The details are: the gorilla weighs 360 pounds, climbs to a height of 20 feet, and does so in 10 seconds. The options are given from A to J, and I have to choose the correct one.

First, I remember that work done against gravity is calculated using the formula: Work = Force × Distance. But wait, I should make sure I'm applying the right formula here. Work done is generally force times distance when the force is applied in the direction of displacement. Since the gorilla is lifting its weight against gravity, the force here is the weight, and the displacement is the height climbed.

So, the gorilla's weight is 360 pounds. I know that weight is a force due to gravity, so that's the force we're considering. The distance is 20 feet. So, the work done should be 360 lb multiplied by 20 ft.

Let me do that calculation: 360 × 20. Hmm, 360 times 20. Let me break it down. 300 times 20 is 6000, and 60 times 20 is 1200. Adding those together, 6000 + 1200 equals 7200. So the work done is 7200 foot-pounds (ft-lb).

Wait a minute, but I remember sometimes in physics, work can also involve time, but I don't think that's the case here. Work is force times distance, and power involves work over time. Since the question is only asking for work done, not power or energy over time, the time given (10 seconds) might be a distractor. So I shouldn't include time in the calculation for work done. It's probably just there to maybe calculate power if the question had asked for it, but here it's irrelevant.

Looking back at the options, option A is 7200 ft-lb, which matches my calculation. Let me double-check the units. The weight is in pounds, which is a force unit, and the height is in feet, so multiplying them gives foot-pounds, which is correct for work. 

I think I'm confident with this answer. So the correct option is A.

The work done is calculated by multiplying the force (weight) by the distance climbed. The gorilla's weight is 360 lb, and the height is 20 ft. 

Work = 360 lb × 20 ft = 7200 ft-lb.

The time is not relevant for calculating work done. 

Answer: A
