Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about a JK flip-flop in toggle mode. I'm a bit rusty on my digital electronics, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that flip-flops are building blocks in digital circuits used to store binary data. The JK flip-flop is one of the common types. The question is asking about the toggle mode, which I think refers to the flip-flop switching its state each time it's triggered.

Wait, what's the toggle mode again? I think toggling means the state changes with each clock pulse. So in toggle mode, every time the clock (or enable signal) comes, the flip-flop's output flips from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0.

Now, the JK flip-flop has two inputs, J and K. I recall that the behavior depends on the combination of J and K. Let me try to remember the truth table for a JK flip-flop.

The truth table goes like this:

- When J=0 and K=0: The flip-flop remains in its current state. So if it's 0, it stays 0; same for 1.
- J=0, K=1: This causes the flip-flop to reset, meaning the output becomes 0.
- J=1, K=0: This sets the flip-flop, making the output 1.
- J=1, K=1: This is the toggle mode because it flips the output state.

Wait, that makes sense. So when both J and K are 1, the flip-flop toggles on each clock pulse. So the correct answer should be B: J=1, K=1.

Let me double-check. Toggle mode is when the output flips each time the clock ticks, right? So yes, J and K both being 1 would cause that. The other options don't result in toggling. Option A, J and K both 0, keeps it the same. Option C, K=1, resets. Option D, J=1, sets. So only option B is toggle.

The correct answer is B: J = 1, K = 1.
