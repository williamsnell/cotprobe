Question:

In a jurisdiction using the grantor grantee indices, the following events have occurred in the order listed below:(1) In 1993, a borrower mortgaged a ranch to a mortgage company to secure a note for $25,000, due on December 31, 1993, with 9V2 percent interest per annum. (2) In 1996, the mortgage company recorded the mortgage on the ranch. (3) In 2007, in a signed writing, which the borrower delivered to his daughter, the borrower promised to convey the ranch to the daughter by a quitclaim deed and pay the mortgage debt when it came due. (4) In 2008, the borrower delivered to the daughter a quitclaim deed that made no reference to the mortgage. If the borrower thereafter defaulted on the mortgage and the mortgage company brought an in personam action against the daughter to recover the amount due on the mortgage debt, the mortgagee will probably

Options:

A: not succeed, because the daughter was not a party to the original mortgage contract.
B: succeed, because the mortgage company has the right to seek payment from any party associated with the property.
C: succeed, because there was an implied delegation of duties to the daughter.
D: succeed, because the mortgage company is a third-party beneficiary of the agreement between the borrower and the daughter.
E: not succeed, because the daughter did not promise to pay the mortgage debt.
F: succeed, because the daughter took ownership of the property with the quitclaim deed.
G: not succeed, because the mortgage company did not record the mortgage until 1996.
H: not succeed, because the daughter was only promised the property, not the debt.
I: succeed, because the borrower defaulted on the mortgage.
J: not succeed, because the law does not permit the mortgagor to delegate duties under this type of a property transfer.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about mortgages and property transfers. Let's break it down step by step.

The question involves a jurisdiction that uses grantor-grantee indices. I remember that these indices are used to keep track of property transfers, so anyone can search by the grantor (seller) or grantee (buyer) to see past transactions.

There are four events listed:

1. In 1993, a borrower mortgaged a ranch to a mortgage company to secure a note for $25,000, due on December 31, 1993, with 9.5% interest per annum. So, this is a mortgage agreement creating a lien on the ranch.

2. In 1996, the mortgage company recorded the mortgage on the ranch. Recording is important because it gives notice to subsequent purchasers and lienholders. But since it was recorded in 1996, that's after the mortgage was created in 1993.

3. In 2007, the borrower, in a signed writing, delivered to his daughter, promised to convey the ranch to her via a quitclaim deed and pay the mortgage debt when it came due. Wait, so he's making a promise to her, but it's a signed writing. But a quitclaim deed transfers whatever interest the grantor has, without warranties. Also, he's promising to pay the mortgage debt when it's due. But here, the mortgage was from 1993, so the note was due in 1993, but perhaps it's been extended or maybe the terms changed? Or perhaps the mortgage was a long-term loan? Hmm, the wording says "due on December 31, 1993," but the events go up to 2008, so maybe the note was refinanced or something, but the question doesn't specify. So perhaps the mortgage is still active.

4. In 2008, the borrower delivered to the daughter a quitclaim deed that made no reference to the mortgage. So now the daughter has the deed, but the deed doesn't mention the mortgage. So she's the owner, but the mortgage is still in place unless it's been paid off.

Then, the borrower defaulted on the mortgage, and the mortgage company sued the daughter in personam (meaning they're suing her personally) to recover the debt.

The question is, will the mortgage company succeed? The options are A through J. Let's look at the options.

Option A: Not succeed because the daughter wasn't a party to the original mortgage contract. That makes sense because the mortgage was between borrower and mortgage company. But the daughter might have some rights based on later events.

Option B: Succeed because the mortgage company can seek payment from any party associated with the property. I'm not sure about this; usually, the mortgage is a debt of the borrower unless there's some assumption or delegation.

Option C: Succeed because there was an implied delegation of duties to the daughter. Delegation is when the original obligor transfers duties to another, but delegation doesn't transfer the duty unless the obligee (mortgage company) consents. Also, the obligation is personal unless there's an assumption.

Option D: Succeed because the mortgage company is a third-party beneficiary. That would require that the agreement between borrower and daughter was intended to benefit the mortgage company. The 2007 writing says the borrower promised to convey the ranch to the daughter and pay the mortgage debt when due. So the mortgage company is a third party who might benefit if the daughter takes over the obligation. But for the mortgage company to be a third-party beneficiary, the agreement between borrower and daughter must have specifically intended to benefit them, which it does here because the borrower is promising to pay the debt. So the mortgage company could be a third-party beneficiary, allowing them to enforce the promise.

Option E: Not succeed because the daughter didn't promise to pay the mortgage debt. This seems accurate because the daughter only received the deed and the promise was from the borrower to pay the debt. The daughter didn't agree to pay; she just got the property.

Option F: Succeed because the daughter took ownership with the quitclaim deed. But owning the property doesn't necessarily mean she's responsible for the mortgage unless she assumed it. A quitclaim deed doesn't transfer liens unless the mortgage is paid off. So the mortgage company can't foreclose on the property because the daughter didn't take on the mortgage debt. She just owns the property, but the mortgage is still with the borrower unless the debt was assumed.

Option G: Not succeed because the mortgage wasn't recorded until 1996. Recording is important for notice to subsequent purchasers, but since the mortgage company recorded it, they have priority over later unrecorded interests. However, the daughter's interest in 2008 would be after the recording, so she would have notice. But since the mortgage was recorded before she took the deed, perhaps she is still bound? Wait, but she didn't take on the mortgage debt, she just got the property. So recording affects whether she has notice, but since she didn't assume the mortgage, maybe this doesn't matter.

Option H: Not succeed because the daughter was only promised the property, not the debt. This seems correct because the daughter didn't agree to pay the debt; the borrower did. So the mortgage company can't sue her unless she's a party to the contract or has assumed the debt.

Option I: Succeed because the borrower defaulted. But the mortgage company can't sue the daughter just because the borrower defaulted. They need a basis to go after the daughter.

Option J: Not succeed because the law doesn't permit the mortgagor to delegate duties under this transfer. Delegation is about transferring duties, but mortgage obligations are personal unless assumed. So the borrower can't just delegate the duty; the daughter would have to assume it. Since she didn't, this might apply.

So let's think again. The key points are:

- The mortgage was between borrower and mortgage company in 1993, recorded in 1996.

- In 2007, borrower promises daughter to convey via quitclaim deed and pay the mortgage debt when due.

- In 2008, the deed is delivered without reference to the mortgage.

- The daughter now owns the ranch via quitclaim, but the mortgage remains with the borrower unless the debt is assumed.

The mortgage company sues the daughter. Can they succeed?

Delegation vs. Assumption: Delegation doesn't transfer the debt; it just informs the creditor that someone else will perform. But the creditor isn't obligated to accept the delegation unless they consent. So even if the borrower delegates, the mortgage company can refuse and still go after the borrower.

Assumption requires the new party to agree to take on the debt, which the daughter didn't do here. She only received the property via quitclaim.

So the mortgage company can't enforce against the daughter unless she assumed the debt or there's a third-party beneficiary situation.

Looking at option D: third-party beneficiary. The idea is that the daughter's agreement with the borrower was intended to benefit the mortgage company. The 2007 writing says the borrower will pay the mortgage debt when due. So the promise is to the mortgage company, making them a third-party beneficiary. In some cases, a third-party beneficiary can enforce the promise if the contract between the borrower and daughter was intended to benefit them.

But wait, the promise was made by the borrower to the daughter, but the benefit goes to the mortgage company. So the mortgage company is a third-party beneficiary. If that's the case, they can enforce the promise.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the daughter might not be liable because she didn't promise to pay, but the mortgage company could argue that they're a third-party beneficiary.

Alternatively, another angle: the recording of the mortgage in 1996 gives the mortgage company priority over later interests. But the daughter's interest is via a quitclaim deed in 2008, so she would have notice of the mortgage because it was recorded. But does that mean she is responsible? No, because she didn't assume the debt. She only took the property, which is subject to the mortgage. So the mortgage company could foreclose on the property but can't sue her personally unless she's liable.

Wait, the question is whether the mortgage company can bring an in personam action against the daughter. In personam is a personal action, not a foreclosure (which is in rem, against the property). So can the mortgage company sue the daughter personally?

If the daughter didn't assume the debt, she's not liable. But if the mortgage company is a third-party beneficiary, then they can sue her.

But I'm not sure if the promise to pay the debt by the borrower to the daughter, making the mortgage company a third-party beneficiary, is sufficient. In some jurisdictions, a third-party beneficiary can enforce if the contract between the primary parties (borrower and daughter) was intended to benefit them.

So in this case, the borrower's promise to pay the mortgage debt to the mortgage company would make the mortgage company a third-party beneficiary. Therefore, the mortgage company can sue the daughter for the debt.

Wait, but the daughter didn't promise to pay; the promise was from the borrower. So the mortgage company can enforce against the borrower, but not necessarily the daughter unless she's a party.

Alternatively, if the mortgage company is a third-party beneficiary, they can sue the daughter. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Because the promise was from the borrower to the daughter, but the benefit is to the mortgage company. So the mortgage company is a donee beneficiary here. Donee beneficiaries can enforce the promise if it's intended for their benefit.

So the answer might be D: the mortgage company is a third-party beneficiary and can succeed.

But wait, another consideration: the mortgage company's rights. The mortgage is a lien on the property. When the borrower conveyed the property to the daughter via quitclaim, the mortgage remains unless the debt is paid or the daughter assumes it. Since the daughter didn't assume it, she holds the property subject to the mortgage. However, the mortgage company can't collect from her personally unless she's a party to the mortgage or has promised to pay.

So if the mortgage company is a third-party beneficiary, they can. Otherwise, they can't.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think of the law. In general, a mortgagee (the lender) can only enforce the mortgage against the mortgagor (borrower) unless someone else has assumed the obligation. So the daughter's taking of the property via quitclaim wouldn't transfer the mortgage debt unless she assumes it.

In this case, the daughter didn't assume the debt; the borrower only promised to pay. So the mortgage company can't sue the daughter unless she's a party. So the correct answer would be E: not succeed because the daughter didn't promise to pay.

Wait, but option D says the mortgage company is a third-party beneficiary. So if the mortgage company is a third-party beneficiary, they can enforce the daughter's promise indirectly. Wait, no, the promise was from the borrower, not the daughter. So the mortgage company can't enforce against the daughter unless she's a party or has assumed the debt.

So the correct answer is E: the mortgage company can't succeed because the daughter didn't promise to pay.

But wait, another angle: the mortgage company recorded the mortgage in 1996, which is before the daughter took the deed in 2008. So the daughter would have constructive notice of the mortgage when she took the deed. But that doesn't make her liable for the debt; it just means she can't argue that she didn't know about the mortgage. But she's still not liable unless she assumed it.

So the mortgage company can't sue her in personam because she didn't agree to pay. So the answer is E.

But another thought: the 2007 agreement says the borrower will convey the ranch and pay the mortgage debt when it comes due. So the mortgage company is a third-party beneficiary. So if the borrower is in default, the mortgage company can enforce against the daughter because she promised (indirectly) to pay through her father's promise.

Wait, but in contract law, the third-party beneficiary can only enforce if they are intended to be a beneficiary. Here, the agreement between the borrower and daughter is that the borrower will pay the mortgage debt. The mortgage company is the one owed the debt, so they're a third-party beneficiary. Therefore, the mortgage company can sue the daughter to enforce the promise.

Wait, no, because the promise is from the borrower, not the daughter. So the mortgage company can't sue the daughter unless she's a party or the promise is to her. The promise is from the borrower to the mortgage company through the daughter's agreement? I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the promise by the borrower to pay the debt to the mortgage company makes the mortgage company a third-party beneficiary. So the mortgage company can sue the daughter if the daughter is the one who is supposed to make the payment. But wait, the daughter didn't promise to pay; the borrower did. So the mortgage company can't enforce against the daughter because she didn't make the promise.

Hmm. I think I'm going in circles. Let's look at the options again.

Option E says the mortgage company won't succeed because the daughter didn't promise to pay. That seems correct because the promise was from the borrower. So the mortgage company can't sue the daughter unless she's a party or has assumed the debt.

So the answer should be E.

The question revolves around whether the mortgage company can succeed in an in personam action against the daughter to recover the mortgage debt. The key points are:

1. The mortgage was created in 1993 between the borrower and the mortgage company, with the mortgage recorded in 1996.
2. In 2007, the borrower promised to convey the ranch to the daughter via a quitclaim deed and pay the mortgage debt when due.
3. In 2008, the borrower delivered the quitclaim deed to the daughter, which did not reference the mortgage.
4. The borrower defaulted, and the mortgage company sued the daughter.

The analysis focuses on whether the daughter is liable for the mortgage debt. The mortgage company cannot enforce the debt against the daughter unless she assumed the obligation or there was a valid delegation or assumption. A quitclaim deed transfers the grantor's interest in the property without assuming any liens or debts unless explicitly agreed. The daughter did not promise to pay the debt; the borrower did. While the mortgage company might be a third-party beneficiary of the agreement between the borrower and daughter, the daughter's liability is not established without her direct assumption of the debt. Therefore, the mortgage company cannot succeed in an in personam action against the daughter because she did not promise to pay the mortgage debt.
