Okay, I'm trying to figure out which BASIC program correctly converts inches to feet and inches. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the goal is to take an input in inches and split it into feet and remaining inches. So for any given number of inches, I should divide by 12 to get the feet part because there are 12 inches in a foot. The remainder after this division will be the inches part.

Looking at the options, each one has a different approach. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: 
- Line 20: F = INT(I/12). That makes sense; dividing by 12 and taking the integer part gives the feet.
- Line 30: I1 = I - (F+1)*12. Wait, that seems off. If I subtract (F+1)*12, that's adding an extra foot. Let me test this. Suppose I=13 inches. F would be 1. I1 would be 13 - 2*12 = -11. That's negative, which can't be right. So this option might not be correct.

Option B:
- Line 20: F = INT((I+6)/12). Hmm, adding 6 before dividing by 12. Maybe to handle cases where I is less than 6? Let's test I=9. (9+6)=15, divided by 12 is 1.25, INT gives 1. Then I1 = 9 - (1-1)*12 = 9. So 9 inches is 1 foot 9 inches? Wait, that's not right. 9 inches is 0 feet 9 inches. So this can't be correct either. Because F would be 1 instead of 0.

Option C:
- Line 20: F = INT(I/15). Wait, 15? No, that's wrong because inches to feet is 12, not 15. So this option is incorrect.

Option D:
- Line 20: F = I/12. But using I/12 without INT would give a float. For example, I=13 would give F=1.083, which isn't correct for feet. It should be an integer. So when printing, it might display as 1 foot, but the calculation for I1 might be off. Line 30: I1 = I - F*10. Wait, 10? No, because 12 inches make a foot. So subtracting F*10 is incorrect. So this option is wrong.

Option E:
- Line 20: F = INT(I/10). 10 isn't the right divisor. Should be 12. So this is incorrect.

Option F:
- The code uses backslashes and O's, which are probably typos. The structure seems similar to A but with some lines missing or misformated. So I'll skip this and check others.

Option G:
- Line 20: F = INT(I * 12). Wait, that's multiplying by 12, which would make F way too large. For example, I=12 would give F=144, which is wrong. So this is incorrect.

Option H:
- Line 20: F = I MOD 12. Wait, MOD gives the remainder when I is divided by 12, which is the inches part, not the feet. So F here is actually the inches, not feet. Then line 30: I1 = I - F. But F is the inches part, so I1 would be I - (I % 12). For I=24, F=0, I1=24. That's not right because 24 inches is 2 feet, so I1 should be 0. So this option is incorrect.

Option I:
- Line 30: I1 = F * 12 - I. Wait, that would make I1 negative if I is more than F*12. For example, I=13, F=1. I1=12-13= -1, which is wrong. So this is incorrect.

Option J:
- Line 20: F = I/12. Again, without INT, it's a float. Line 30: I1 = I - F*12. Wait, that's correct. Because F is I/12, so F*12 is the total inches in feet. Subtracting that from I gives the remaining inches. But wait, in BASIC, if F is a float like 13/12=1.083, then F*12 is 13. So I1 = I - 13 =0. So for I=13, it correctly gives 1 foot and 0 inches. But wait, the issue is that F is a float, so when printed, it might show as 1.083 instead of 1. But in the PRINT statement, it's printed as F; which would show all decimal places. So the program would output 1 foot and 0 inches correctly, but the feet part would have decimal places. However, looking at the options, perhaps the intended way is to use integer division. So maybe this option is not the best, but let's check if any other options are correct.

Wait, going back to Option A. Let me reevaluate it. Line 30: I1 = I - (F+1)*12. So for I=13, F=1. So I1=13 - 2*12=13-24=-11. That's negative, which is wrong. So Option A is wrong.

Looking at Option B again. For I=9, F=INT((9+6)/12)=INT(15/12)=1. Then I1=9 - (1-1)*12=9. So it prints 9 inches as 1 foot 9 inches, which is wrong because 9 inches is 0 feet and 9 inches. So Option B is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating Option B. Let me test I=86.

F = INT((86+6)/12)=INT(92/12)=7 (since 12*7=84, 92-84=8). Then I1=86 - (7-1)*12=86 - 6*12=86-72=14. So it would print 86 inches as 7 feet 14 inches. That's impossible because 14 inches is more than a foot. So Option B is wrong.

Option D: Let's test I=12. F=12/12=1.0, I1=12 - 1.0*12=0. So that's correct. But for I=13, F=1.083, I1=13 - 1.083*12≈13-13=0. But the feet would display as 1.083, which is incorrect. So it's better to have F as integer.

Option J: Let's test I=13. F=13/12=1.083, I1=13 - 1.083*12=0. So the output would be 13 inches = 1.083 feet 0 inches. That's not ideal, but the calculation of I1 is correct. However, the feet should be an integer. So perhaps the correct approach is to use integer division for F.

Looking back, the correct approach is to calculate F as INT(I/12), then I1 = I - F*12. Let's see which option does this.

Looking at Option A again: I1 = I - (F+1)*12. That's wrong.

Option B: I1 = I - (F-1)*12. Also wrong.

Option C: Uses 15, so wrong.

Option D: I1 = I - F*10. Wrong.

Option E: Uses 10, wrong.

Option F and G: Seems like typos, probably not correct.

Option H: F is I MOD 12, which is inches, not feet. So wrong.

Option I: I1 = F*12 - I. For I=13, F=1, I1=12-13=-1. Wrong.

Option J: F = I/12, which is float, but I1 = I - F*12. So for I=13, I1=13 - (13)=0. So F is 1.083, which is incorrect as it should be 1.

Wait, but in Option J, line 30 is I1 = I - F*12. So for any I, this correctly gives the remainder. But the issue is that F is a float, not an integer. So the feet part should be an integer.

Wait, perhaps the correct code is to compute F as integer division. So looking again, which option does that?

Looking at Option A: F = INT(I/12). Then I1 = I - (F+1)*12. As before, that's wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine.

The correct formula is F = INT(I / 12), and I1 = I - F * 12.

Looking at the options, which one does this?

Option A: Line 30: I1 = I - (F+1)*12 → wrong.

Option B: Line 30: I1 = I - (F-1)*12 → wrong.

Option D: Line 30: I1 = I - F*10 → wrong.

Option F: Line 30: I1 = I - F*12 → correct.

Wait, looking at Option F, but the code seems to have some typos with backslashes and O's, but perhaps it's a formatting issue. Let me check.

Option F:
10 READ I
20 LET F = INT(I/12)
30 LET I1 = I - F*12
40 PRINT I "INCHES = "; F;"FEET"; I1; "INCHES"
45 GO TO 10
50 DATA 9, 86, 47, 37, 947, 48
60 END

Wait, the line numbers in F have '1\O' which might be a typo, but the logic seems correct. So F is correct in calculation.

Wait, but in the initial analysis, I thought Option F's line numbers were messed up, but perhaps it's a formatting error. Assuming the code is correct, then Option F would compute F correctly as integer division and I1 correctly as remainder.

But looking back, I think I might have missed that earlier. So the correct code should compute F as INT(I/12) and I1 as I-F*12.

Looking at the options, which one does that?

Option A: F is correct, but I1 is wrong.

Option F: F is correct, I1 is correct. So perhaps Option F is correct despite the formatting issues.

Wait, but in the user's message, the options are presented with some lines as '1\O' which seems like a typo, perhaps meant to be line 10, etc. So if we ignore the formatting, the code in Option F is correct.

Alternatively, looking at other options, perhaps Option F is the correct one. But earlier I thought Option A was wrong because of I1.

Wait, perhaps I should test each option with sample data.

Let's pick I=15 inches.

Correct conversion: 1 foot 3 inches.

Testing Option A:

Line 20: F=INT(15/12)=1.

Line 30: I1=15 - (1+1)*12=15-24=-9 → wrong.

Option B:

F=INT((15+6)/12)=INT(21/12)=1.

I1=15 - (1-1)*12=15-0=15 → wrong.

Option F:

F=INT(15/12)=1.

I1=15 -1*12=3 → correct.

So Option F's calculation is correct.

Wait, but in the user's options, Option F has line numbers like 1\O which might be a typo. But assuming the code is correct, then Option F is the right one.

Wait, but looking back, the user's options are labeled A to J, and each has their own code.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check Option F again.

Option F:

10 READ I

20 LET F = INT(I/12)

30 LET I1 = I - F*12

40 PRINT I "INCHES = "; F;"FEET"; I1; "INCHES"

45 GO TO 10

50 DATA 9, 86, 47, 37, 947, 48

60 END

Yes, that's correct. So the correct answer should be Option F, but looking at the original options, perhaps the formatting is off, but the logic is correct.

Wait, but in the initial options, Option A is:

A: 10 READ I 20 LET F = INT(I/12) 30 LET I1 = I - (F+1)*12 40 PRINT I "INCHES = "; F;"FEET"; I1; "INCHES" 50 GO TO 10 60 DATA 9, 86, 47, 37, 947, 48 70 END

So Option A has I1 = I - (F+1)*12, which is wrong. So the correct one is Option F.

Wait, but in the user's options, Option F is written with some backslashes and O's, which might be typos. So perhaps the correct option is F, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct option is A, but no, because I1 is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should think about other options. Let's check Option G.

Option G:

10 READ I

20 LET F = INT(I*12)

Which would make F way too big. So no.

Option H:

F = I MOD 12 → which is the inches part, not feet. So wrong.

So the only correct calculation is in Option F, despite the possible formatting issues.
</think>

The correct program should compute feet as the integer division of inches by 12 and the remaining inches as the remainder. Option F does this correctly with `F = INT(I/12)` and `I1 = I - F*12`. 

Answer: F
