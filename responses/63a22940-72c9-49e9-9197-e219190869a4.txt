Okay, so I've got this question about the heat of vaporization of two liquids, A and B. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

First, the problem states that at 40°C, the vapor pressure of liquid A is 20 mm Hg, and for liquid B, it's 40 mm Hg. Also, the normal boiling points are given: A boils at 120°C and B at 140°C. The heat of vaporization for A is 11.3 kcal/mole. I need to find out which option best describes the heat of vaporization of B.

Hmm, I remember that the heat of vaporization relates to how much energy is required to turn a liquid into a gas. The formula I think is ΔH_vap = (P2 - P1) * R * T / (ln(P2/P1)), but wait, maybe that's for calculating vapor pressure at different temperatures using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Oh right, the Clausius-Clapeyron equation is dP/dT = (ΔH_vap) / (T * ΔS_vap), but since ΔS_vap is ΔH_vap / T, it simplifies to dP/dT = (ΔH_vap) / (T²). So, maybe I can use that to compare the two substances.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I can directly compare A and B using this because I don't know their specific enthalpy values beyond A. Alternatively, maybe I can think about the relationship between vapor pressure and boiling point. The higher the boiling point, the higher the heat of vaporization, I think, because it takes more energy to get to a higher temperature and then vaporize.

Wait, no. Wait, the boiling point is the temperature at which the vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure, usually around 1 atm or 760 mm Hg. So, for each liquid, at their boiling points, their vapor pressure is 760 mm Hg. But the question gives their vapor pressures at 40°C, which is below their boiling points.

So, liquid A's vapor pressure at 40°C is 20 mm Hg, and B's is 40 mm Hg. Now, since B's vapor pressure is higher at the same temperature (40°C), that suggests that B is more volatile than A at that temperature. But I'm trying to find the heat of vaporization of B, given that I know A's.

Wait, maybe I can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to find the relationship between the two. The equation is ln(P2/P1) = -ΔH_vap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1) / (1). But I'm not sure if I can apply it directly here because I don't have enough data points for each substance. Let me think: for each liquid, I have their vapor pressure at 40°C and their boiling points. So maybe I can calculate ΔH_vap for each using the data points I have.

Wait, for liquid A, at 40°C, P is 20 mm Hg, and at 120°C, P is 760 mm Hg. So I can use those two points to calculate ΔH_vap for A, which is given as 11.3 kcal/mol. Let's see if that makes sense.

The Clausius-Clapeyron equation in integrated form is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap/R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) / (1), assuming ΔH_vap is constant over the temperature range. Let's plug in the numbers for A.

P1 = 20 mm Hg (40°C = 313.15 K), P2 = 760 mm Hg (120°C = 393.15 K). So ln(760/20) = ln(38) ≈ 3.638.

ΔH_vap/R * (1/313.15 - 1/393.15) = ΔH_vap/(R) * ( (393.15 - 313.15) / (313.15 * 393.15) ) ) = ΔH_vap/(R) * (80 / (313.15 * 393.15)).

So 3.638 ≈ (ΔH_vap / R) * (80)/(313.15 * 393.15). Let me compute the denominator: 313.15 * 393.15 ≈ 313*393 ≈ 123,000 (approx 122,709). So 80 / 122709 ≈ 6.525e-4.

So 3.638 ≈ (ΔH_vap / R) * 6.525e-4.

R is the gas constant, which is 1.987 cal/(mol·K). Wait, but wait, the units in the problem are kcal, so I should convert R to kcal. Since 1 kcal = 1000 cal, R = 1.987 cal/(mol·K) = 0.001987 kcal/(mol·K).

So, 3.638 ≈ (ΔH_vap / 0.001987) * 6.525e-4.

Let me compute (ΔH_vap / 0.001987) * 6.525e-4: that's ΔH_vap * (6.525e-4 / 0.001987) ≈ ΔH_vap * (0.328).

So 3.638 ≈ ΔH_vap * 0.328 → ΔH_vap ≈ 3.638 / 0.328 ≈ 11.09 kcal/mol. Wait, but the given value for A is 11.3 kcal/mol. Hmm, that's close but not exact. Maybe I made a calculation error.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the denominator. Let me recalculate 313.15 * 393.15 more accurately. 313.15 * 393.15 ≈ (300 + 13.15) * (400 - 6.85) → 300*400=120000, 300*(-6.85)= -2055, 13.15*400=5260, 13.15*(-6.85)= -90. So total ≈ 120000 -2055 +5260 -90 = 120000 + 3115 = 123115. So 80 / 123115 ≈ 6.501e-4.

So the equation becomes 3.638 ≈ (ΔH_vap / 0.001987) * 6.501e-4. Let's compute 6.501e-4 / 0.001987 ≈ 0.328 as before. So ΔH_vap ≈ 3.638 / 0.328 ≈ 11.09 kcal/mol. But the problem states that A's ΔH_vap is 11.3 kcal/mol. Hmm, slight discrepancy, but maybe due to rounding in the problem.

Now, for liquid B, let's do the same. Its vapor pressure at 40°C is 40 mm Hg, and at 140°C, it's 760 mm Hg. So T1 = 40°C = 313.15 K, T2 = 140°C = 413.15 K. P1=40 mm Hg, P2=760 mm Hg.

So ln(P2/P1) = ln(760/40) = ln(19) ≈ 2.944.

Using the same Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

ln(19) = (ΔH_vap_B / R) * (1/313.15 - 1/413.15).

Compute (1/313.15 - 1/413.15) = (413.15 - 313.15) / (313.15 * 413.15) ) = 100 / (313.15 * 413.15) ≈ 100/(129,415) ≈ 7.73e-4.

So 2.944 ≈ (ΔH_vap_B / 0.001987) * 7.73e-4.

Calculate 7.73e-4 / 0.001987 ≈ 0.389.

So 2.944 ≈ ΔH_vap_B * 0.389 → ΔH_vap_B ≈ 2.944 / 0.389 ≈ 7.57 kcal/mol.

Wait, that's approximately 7.57 kcal/mol. Looking at the options, I don't see that exact number. The options are:

A: 22.6 kcal

B:5.65 kcal

C:7.58 kcal

D:11.3 kcal

So C is 7.58 kcal/mol, which is very close to my calculation. So the answer should be C.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations for B. Let me go through the steps again.

Compute ln(760/40) = ln(19) ≈ 2.9444.

Compute (1/313.15 - 1/413.15) = (413.15 - 313.15)/(313.15*413.15) = 100/(313.15*413.15).

Compute 313.15 * 413.15: let me compute it more precisely.

313.15 * 413.15:

Let me compute 313 * 413 = ?

313 * 400 = 125,200

313 * 13 = 4,069 → total 129,269.

But 313.15 * 413.15 is approximately 313.15 * 413.15 ≈ 313 * 413 + some more. Let me compute 313.15 * 413.15 as (313 + 0.15)(413 + 0.15) = 313*413 + 313*0.15 + 0.15*413 + 0.15^2. 313*413 is 129,269 as above. 313*0.15 = 46.95, 0.15*413 = 61.95, and 0.0225. So total ≈ 129,269 + 46.95 +61.95 + 0.0225 = 129,269 + 108.9225 ≈ 129,377.9225.

So 100 / 129,377.9225 ≈ 7.73e-4 as before.

So 2.9444 ≈ (ΔH_vap_B / 0.001987) * 7.73e-4.

Wait, 7.73e-4 divided by 0.001987 is 0.389, so ΔH_vap_B = 2.9444 / 0.389 ≈ 7.57 kcal/mol. So that's about 7.57, which rounds to 7.58 as option C.

So the answer should be C, 7.58 kcal/mol.

But wait, let me think again. The problem gives the vapor pressures at 40°C, and their boiling points. So the calculation I did for each is correct, using their respective T and P values. So yes, B's ΔH_vap is about 7.58 kcal/mol, which is option C.

To determine the heat of vaporization (ΔH_vap) of liquid B, we use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) = \frac{\Delta H_{\text{vap}}}{R} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)
\]

### For Liquid A:
- At 40°C (313.15 K), vapor pressure \(P_1 = 20 \, \text{mm Hg}\).
- At 120°C (393.15 K), vapor pressure \(P_2 = 760 \, \text{mm Hg}\).
- Given \(\Delta H_{\text{vap}} = 11.3 \, \text{kcal/mol}\).

Using the equation:
\[
\ln\left(\frac{760}{20}\right) = \ln(38) \approx 3.638
\]
\[
\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{313.15} - \frac{1}{393.15} = \frac{80}{313.15 \cdot 393.15} \approx 6.525 \times 10^{-4}
\]
\[
3.638 = \frac{\Delta H_{\text{vap}}}{0.001987} \cdot 6.525 \times 10^{-4}
\]
\[
\Delta H_{\text{vap}} \approx 11.09 \, \text{kcal/mol}
\]
This is consistent with the given value of \(11.3 \, \text{kcal/mol}\) for liquid A.

### For Liquid B:
- At 40°C (313.15 K), vapor pressure \(P_1 = 40 \, \text{mm Hg}\).
- At 140°C (413.15 K), vapor pressure \(P_2 = 760 \, \text{mm Hg}\).

Using the equation:
\[
\ln\left(\frac{760}{40}\right) = \ln(19) \approx 2.944
\]
\[
\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{313.15} - \frac{1}{413.15} = \frac{100}{313.15 \cdot 413.15} \approx 7.73 \times 10^{-4}
\]
\[
2.944 = \frac{\Delta H_{\text{vap}}}{0.001987} \cdot 7.73 \times 10^{-4}
\]
\[
\Delta H_{\text{vap}} \approx 7.58 \, \text{kcal/mol}
\]

### Conclusion:
The heat of vaporization of liquid B is approximately \(7.58 \, \text{kcal/mol}\), which corresponds to option **C**.
