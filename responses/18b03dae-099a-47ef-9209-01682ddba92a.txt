Question:

A man, his brother and his friend all discuss murdering the man's neighbor because the neighbor took some shots at the man's dog but he missed. They agree on a plan. They decided on strychnine poisoning, which the friend told them how to get and they went and got it. When they asked the friend to go forward in poisoning the victim, he refused, saying, "I'm was only here for planning and advice, but I never intended to commit murder." The man and his brother took the poison to a meeting with the neighbor, but he wouldn't drink. They were caught and arrested. The statute requires an overt act for criminal conspiracy. Which of the following most accurately states the criminal responsibility of each of the three men?

Options:

A: The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, and the friend is guilty of criminal conspiracy.
B: The man, his brother, and the friend are all guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder.
C: The man and his brother have committed criminal conspiracy and attempted murder.
D: The friend is guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, but the man and his brother are not guilty.
E: The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, but the friend is guilty of nothing.
F: The friend is guilty of conspiracy, but not the man and his brother.
G: The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy, while the friend is guilty of attempted murder.
H: The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy but not attempted murder.
I: Only the man is guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, while his brother and the friend are not guilty.
J: The man and his brother are guilty of attempted murder, but not conspiracy.

Okay, so I've got this law question here about criminal conspiracy and the responsibilities of the three men involved. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, the scenario: A man, his brother, and their friend are discussing murdering the man's neighbor because the neighbor took shots at the man's dog but missed. They agreed on a plan to use strychnine poisoning. The friend provided information on how to get the poison, and they went and obtained it. However, when asked to go through with the poisoning, the friend refused, saying he was only there for planning and advice, not intending to commit murder. The man and his brother took the poison to meet the neighbor, but he refused to drink it. They were caught and arrested. The statute requires an overt act for criminal conspiracy.

The question is about the criminal responsibility of each of the three men. The options are A through J, each suggesting different levels of guilt or innocence.

I remember that conspiracy typically involves an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime, followed by an overt act in furtherance of that agreement. So, the key here is whether each person is part of the conspiracy and whether they took any overt acts.

Let's analyze each person:

1. **The Man (let's call him Person A):** He's the one whose dog was shot. He's part of the initial discussion, agrees to the plan, and actually takes the poison to meet the neighbor. So he clearly took an overt act by obtaining the poison and attempting to use it. So he's definitely involved in the conspiracy and attempted murder.

2. **The Brother (Person B):** Similarly, he's part of the initial plan, goes along with it, and also takes the poison to the neighbor. So he's also taken an overt act, making him guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder.

3. **The Friend (Person C):** He provided advice on how to get the poison and went to get it with them. But when it came time to actually poison the neighbor, he refused. So, he was involved in the planning and the overt act of obtaining the poison but didn't go through with the final act. Now, the statute requires an overt act for conspiracy, so if he took part in any overt act, he might be guilty. But since he only planned and advised but didn't commit the final act, does that affect his liability?

Wait, in conspiracy, each conspirator is responsible for the acts of the others in furtherance of the conspiracy. So, if the overt act (like getting the poison) was done by the others, the friend might still be liable because he was part of the conspiracy when that act occurred.

But the friend said he only intended to plan and advise, not to commit murder. However, whether that affects his liability depends on whether he withdrew from the conspiracy before the overt act. Did he communicate his withdrawal to the others? The question says he refused to go forward when asked, but it doesn't say he withdrew. So, if he didn't withdraw properly, he might still be liable.

So, all three were part of the conspiracy. But what about the attempt? Attempt requires specific intent to commit the crime. The friend didn't actually attempt to poison the neighbor, so perhaps he didn't commit the attempt. But wait, the overt act for conspiracy might be enough for him to be part of the conspiracy, but not necessarily the attempt.

Wait, but the statute requires an overt act for conspiracy, so if the friend was part of the conspiracy when the overt act (getting the poison) happened, then he's guilty of conspiracy. As for attempt, the attempt would be the act of taking the poison to the neighbor. Since the friend didn't do that, maybe he's not guilty of attempt.

So, the man and brother are guilty of both conspiracy and attempted murder because they took the overt act and attempted the murder. The friend is guilty of conspiracy because he was part of the plan and the overt act (getting the poison), but not of attempted murder because he didn't carry out the final act.

Looking at the options:

Option A says: The man and brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, and the friend is guilty of conspiracy. That matches what I'm thinking.

Option E says the man and brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, and the friend guilty of nothing. But the friend was part of the conspiracy, so E is incorrect.

Option C: The man and brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder. It doesn't mention the friend, so perhaps it's not the most accurate because the friend is also guilty of conspiracy.

Wait, but looking at the options, A includes the friend as guilty of conspiracy, which is correct. So the correct answer should be A.

The correct answer is A. The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, while the friend is guilty of conspiracy but not attempted murder.

Answer: A
