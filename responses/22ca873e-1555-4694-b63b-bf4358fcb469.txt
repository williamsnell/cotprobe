Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about what a CPA usually does when reviewing the financial statements of a nonissuer. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think through each option carefully.

First, I remember that a CPA's review for a nonissuer would be different from an audit for a public company. Nonissuers aren't subject to the same stringent auditing standards as public companies, so the procedures might be more limited.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Make inquiries of management concerning restrictions on the availability of cash balances. Hmm, that sounds like something a CPA would do. Cash is a big asset, and understanding any restrictions would be important for the financial statements. But wait, in a review, how deep do they go? I'm not sure if this is a standard procedure or more of an audit step.

Option B: Examine trend analysis to determine the appropriateness of the CPA's assessment of detection risk. Detection risk is about the chance that the CPA's procedures might not catch a material misstatement. Trend analysis could help assess this. But I'm not certain if this is a typical review procedure. Maybe more in planning the audit?

Option C: Conduct a physical inventory count. That's definitely something I associate with audits, especially for companies with physical goods. But for a review, maybe they don't do this because it's more of a sampling or observation? Or perhaps they don't do the physical count themselves. I'm not sure.

Option D: Analyze the company's market position and competitive advantage. That sounds more like strategic analysis. I don't think CPAs do this as part of a financial statement review. They focus on the financials, not the company's market position.

Option E: Evaluate management's plans for dealing with negative trends and financial difficulties. This seems relevant because the CPA would want to know if the company is facing issues and how management is handling them. It could affect the financial health and the auditor's opinion.

Option F: Inspect contracts for potential legal issues or obligations. Contract review can be part of an audit, especially for contingent liabilities. But in a review, maybe it's more about understanding the environment rather than inspecting contracts in detail.

Option G: Review the entity's compliance with tax laws. Tax compliance is important, but for a nonissuer, maybe the CPA does a more limited review here. I'm not sure if this is a standard procedure they perform during a review.

Option H: Evaluate the company's hiring practices and employee benefits packages. This seems unrelated to financial statement reviewing. It's more about HR or company culture, not the financials.

Option I: Assess the entity's IT systems and cyber security measures. While important, I don't think this is a typical part of a CPA's review. Unless the company is in a sector where IT is critical, but generally, this might be more for internal audit or management.

Option J: Communicate deficiencies in the design of internal control to the entity's audit committee. This sounds like a key part of an audit, especially for nonissuers. If there are control weaknesses, the CPA would communicate that, especially if it's significant.

Now, thinking about the types of procedures in a review engagement. Reviews are more about analytical procedures and inquires, less on physical counts or detailed testing. So options like A, E, and J could be relevant.

Option A is about cash restrictions. In a review, the CPA might inquire about this but might not perform a physical observation. So maybe A is part of the review.

Option E is about evaluating management's plans. This seems like the CPA would assess whether management is addressing issues, which affects the financial statements' fairness.

Option J is about internal control deficiencies. Review engagements do require the CPA to identify and communicate significant deficiencies in internal controls.

Wait, the question is about which procedure is usually performed. So which of these are standard in a review?

I think in a review, the CPA does make inquiries (A), examines analytical procedures (like trend analysis, B), and communicates material weaknesses (J). But wait, option B is about detection risk, which is more of an audit concept. In a review, they might not assess detection risk the same way.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is E, because the CPA would assess management's ability to deal with issues, which affects the financial statements' outcome. Or J, because communicating control deficiencies is a key part of the review process.

Wait, the options: the question is about which procedure does a CPA perform when reviewing the financial statements of a nonissuer. So looking for standard review procedures.

In a review engagement, the CPA typically performs limited procedures, such as inquiries, analytical procedures, and may observe certain processes. They don't perform physical counts (C), inspect contracts (F), or assess market position (D). They do communicate significant findings, including internal control issues (J).

So options A, E, and J are possible. But the question is which one is a usual procedure.

Option J: Communicate deficiencies in the design of internal control to the audit committee. That seems like a standard procedure because it's part of the review to assess internal controls and report significant issues.

Option E: Evaluate management's plans for negative trends. That's also part of understanding the environment and assessing risks, so it's likely done.

But the question is which procedure is performed. So perhaps more than one could be correct, but since it's multiple choice, the best answer is likely E or J.

Wait, the standard review engagement for a nonissuer includes procedures like making inquiries, performing analytical procedures, and may involve assessing the entity's internal controls. If there are significant deficiencies in internal controls, the CPA must communicate them to those charged with governance, like the audit committee.

So option J is a procedure they perform.

Alternatively, option E is about evaluating management's plans, which is more about understanding the entity and its environment, which is part of the review.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me recall the review standards.

In a review engagement, the CPA performs analytical procedures and makes inquiries to understand the entity and its environment. They assess the risk of material misstatement and may identify areas where the financial statements could be misstated. If they find that internal controls are deficient, they must communicate that to the audit committee or those responsible.

So option J is definitely something they do. Option E, evaluating management's plans, might be part of the risk assessment but perhaps not a procedure per se.

So the answer might be J.

But wait, another angle: the question is about which procedure is performed. So perhaps the best answer is E or J.

Wait, looking back, the options:

A: Make inquiries about cash restrictions. That's a standard procedure.

E: Evaluate management's plans. That's more about understanding the entity's situation.

J: Communicate control deficiencies. That's a required communication.

So all three could be correct, but the question is asking which procedure is usually performed. Since all are options, I need to choose the best one.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E because the CPA would assess whether management's plans are adequate to address issues, which affects the financial statements.

But I'm not entirely sure. I think the most correct answer is E because it's about evaluating how management is handling potential problems, which is part of the CPA's review to determine if the financial statements are fairly presented.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.

In a review engagement, the CPA's objectives are to provide a limited assurance that nothing comes to their attention that indicates the financial statements are not presented, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework.

To achieve this, the CPA would perform analytical procedures and inquiries. So making inquiries (A) is definitely done. They might also assess whether management's plans are sufficient (E) to deal with issues. And if there are control deficiencies, they must communicate them (J).

So which of these is a procedure they perform? All of A, E, and J could be correct, but the question is which is a usual procedure.

Wait, looking at the options again, the question is which procedure does a CPA usually perform. So all of these could be part of the review, but perhaps the most correct answer is E.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E because it's about the company's ability to deal with issues, which is part of the CPA's assessment.

Wait, I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the standard steps.

In a review engagement, the CPA typically:

- Makes inquiries of management and others.

- Performs analytical procedures to identify unusual trends or relationships.

- May observe certain operations.

- Communicates significant findings, including deficiencies in internal controls.

So among the options, A (inquiries about cash), E (evaluate management's plans), and J (communicate control deficiencies) are all possible.

But the question is which procedure is usually performed. So the correct answer would be E, because evaluating management's plans is part of assessing the entity's situation and how it affects the financial statements.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: in a review, the CPA doesn't perform a physical inventory (C), doesn't conduct a full tax review (G), etc. So among the options, A, E, and J are more likely.

Looking at the options again, the answer is probably E because it's about evaluating how management is handling negative trends, which is part of the CPA's assessment in a review.

Wait, but I'm not 100% confident. Another thought: the answer is J because communicating control deficiencies is a key part of the review process, especially for nonissuers who are subject to certain regulations.

Alternatively, the answer is E because it's about the company's ability to deal with issues, which directly affects the financial statements.

Hmm. I think I'll go with E because it's about evaluating management's plans, which is part of understanding the entity and assessing risks.

The question asks which procedure a CPA typically performs when reviewing the financial statements of a nonissuer. To determine the correct answer, each option was analyzed in the context of a review engagement, which involves limited assurance and focuses on analytical procedures, inquiries, and communication of significant findings.

- **Option A**: Making inquiries about cash restrictions is a standard procedure in reviews, as understanding cash availability is crucial for assessing financial statements.
- **Option E**: Evaluating management's plans for dealing with negative trends is part of assessing the entity's risks and how it affects the financial statements.
- **Option J**: Communicating deficiencies in internal controls is a key requirement in reviews, as it ensures that significant issues are reported to those responsible for governance.

While all three options (A, E, and J) are relevant, the most appropriate answer is **E**, as evaluating management's plans is a fundamental part of the CPA's assessment in a review engagement, helping to determine the fairness of the financial statements.

Answer: E
