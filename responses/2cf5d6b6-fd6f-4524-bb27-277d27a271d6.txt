Okay, so I've got this problem where a point (x, y) is randomly picked from inside a rectangle with vertices at (0,0), (3,0), (3,2), and (0,2). I need to find the probability that x < y. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I should visualize the rectangle. The rectangle's length along the x-axis is from 0 to 3, so that's 3 units long. The height along the y-axis is from 0 to 2, which is 2 units. So the rectangle is twice as long as it is tall.

Now, since the point is chosen randomly, I think this implies a uniform distribution over the area of the rectangle. That means the probability of the point being in a certain region is the area of that region divided by the total area of the rectangle.

So, the first thing I should calculate is the total area of the rectangle. The area of a rectangle is just length times width. Here, length is 3 and width is 2, so the total area is 3 * 2 = 6.

Next, I need to find the area within this rectangle where x < y. To do that, I should probably graph the line x = y within the rectangle and see what region satisfies x < y.

Wait, but the rectangle goes from x=0 to x=3 and y=0 to y=2. So the line x = y starts at the origin (0,0) and goes up. But since the rectangle's maximum y is 2 and maximum x is 3, where does the line x = y intersect the rectangle? Let me think. At y=2, x would be 2, so the line ends at (2,2). Beyond that, the rectangle continues to x=3, but y is capped at 2.

So the line x = y goes from (0,0) to (2,2). Now, the area where x < y would be the region above this line within the rectangle. But wait, since the rectangle's maximum x is 3 and y is 2, the region where x < y is only up to y=2 and x=2. Beyond x=2, the condition x < y can't be satisfied because y can't be more than 2, and x can go up to 3. So for x > 2, x will always be greater than y (since y is at most 2), so x < y is false there.

Therefore, the region where x < y is a triangle from (0,0) to (2,2) within the rectangle. Let me confirm that. So the triangle's vertices are at (0,0), (2,2), and (0,2). Wait, no, because the line x=y goes from (0,0) to (2,2), and the region above that line within the rectangle would be a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (0,2), and (2,2). Because from x=0 to x=2, y can go from x up to 2. Beyond x=2, y can't be greater than x because x goes up to 3, but y max is 2.

Wait, maybe I should sketch this mentally. The rectangle is 3 units wide and 2 units tall. The line x=y starts at (0,0) and goes to (2,2). So above that line, within the rectangle, the area is a triangle bounded by (0,0), (2,2), and (0,2). Because at x=0, y can go up to 2, and at x=2, y is exactly 2. So the area where x < y is this triangle.

The area of a triangle is (base * height)/2. Here, the base is from (0,0) to (2,2), which is along the line y=x. Wait, but perhaps it's easier to think of it as a right triangle with legs of length 2. Because from (0,0) to (0,2) is 2 units, and from (0,0) to (2,2) is the hypotenuse.

Wait, no, actually, the triangle is a right triangle with base along the y-axis from (0,0) to (0,2), and the other side from (0,2) to (2,2), which is 2 units along the x-axis. So actually, the triangle is a right triangle with legs of 2 units each, but that doesn't seem right because the line x=y goes from (0,0) to (2,2). Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the area of the region where x < y by integrating over the rectangle. But maybe that's overcomplicating it.

Wait, let's think about it differently. The region where x < y is the area above the line x=y within the rectangle. So the area is the area of the triangle formed by (0,0), (2,2), and (0,2). The base of this triangle is along the y-axis from (0,0) to (0,2), which is 2 units. The height is along the line x=y from (0,0) to (2,2), which is 2 units. So the area of this triangle would be (base * height)/2 = (2 * 2)/2 = 2.

Wait, that can't be right because the entire rectangle's area is 6, and this triangle's area is 2, which would make the probability 2/6 = 1/3. But let me check again.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the triangle's area. Let me try another approach. The line x=y within the rectangle goes from (0,0) to (2,2). Above this line, within the rectangle, the region is a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (2,2), and (0,2). So, the base is from (0,0) to (0,2), which is 2 units, and the height is from (0,2) to (2,2), which is 2 units as well. So the area is indeed (2 * 2)/2 = 2.

So the area where x < y is 2. The total area of the rectangle is 6, so the probability is 2/6 = 1/3.

Wait, but that would mean the probability is 1/3, which is option F. But I'm not sure if that's correct because I'm visualizing the line x=y cutting the rectangle into two parts, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait another thought: perhaps I should consider the area where x < y more carefully. For x from 0 to 2, y can go from x to 2. For x from 2 to 3, since y can't exceed 2, but x is greater than 2, so y can't be greater than x, so x < y can't happen there. So the area is the integral from x=0 to x=2 of (2 - x) dx.

Calculating that integral: ∫(2 - x) dx from 0 to 2 = [2x - (x²)/2] from 0 to 2 = (4 - 2) - (0 - 0) = 2.

So that's the same result as before. So the area is 2, total area is 6, so probability is 1/3. So the answer would be F: 1/3.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are A to J, and F is 1/3. So that's the answer.

The problem involves finding the probability that a randomly selected point (x, y) from a rectangle with vertices at (0,0), (3,0), (3,2), and (0,2) satisfies x < y. 

1. **Rectangle Area**: The rectangle's length is 3 (along the x-axis) and width is 2 (along the y-axis), giving a total area of 3 × 2 = 6.

2. **Region where x < y**: The line x = y intersects the rectangle at (0,0) and (2,2). The region where x < y is above this line within the rectangle, forming a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (2,2), and (0,2). 

3. **Triangle Area**: The triangle's base and height are both 2 units. Its area is (2 × 2) / 2 = 2.

4. **Probability Calculation**: The probability is the area of the triangle divided by the rectangle's area, which is 2 / 6 = 1/3.

Thus, the probability that x < y is 1/3.

Answer: F
