Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Oh, shame on you, poor Winter King!
What's this that you have done?
Is 't not a very naughty thing
To snatch the kaiser's crown?
Now you will have to stay away
Alike from Rhine and Prague,
And more than that-shame and dismay
Your days and nights will plague.
Right well you knew, and all the world,
Right well they know this thing,
That Ferdinand alone can be
Bohemia's lawful king.
So come, dear Fritz, rouse up and go
To Ferdinand, your king,
And beg him graciously to show
Full pardon for your sin.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the song and the narrator's likely religious affiliation. Let me start by reading the song lyrics carefully.

The song is titled "Poor Winter King" and it's from the seventeenth century. The lyrics mention a "Winter King" and refer to Ferdinand as the lawful king of Bohemia. Hmm, I think I remember something about the Winter King from history. I believe it's related to the Thirty Years' War, which was a major conflict in Europe during the 17th century. 

The Winter King was actually Frederick V, Elector Palatine, who was a Protestant. He was married to Elizabeth Stuart, the daughter of King James I of England. They were part of the Protestant faction during the war, which was opposed by the Catholic Habsburgs. Ferdinand II was the Catholic king who was trying to reassert Catholicism in Bohemia, and after the Battle of White Mountain in 1620, he took over as king, leading to the exile of the Winter King.

So the song is probably from a Protestant perspective, urging Ferdinand (the lawful king) to pardon the Winter King. The narrator is encouraging Fritz (Frederick) to go to Ferdinand and seek pardon. Since Frederick was Protestant and Ferdinand was Catholic, the song's narrator is likely a Protestant supporting the Protestant cause.

Looking at the options, the possible religions are A through J. The options include Protestant (I) and Roman Catholic (A), among others. Since the song seems to be from the perspective of someone supporting the Protestant Winter King, the narrator is probably Protestant.
