Question:

Given 2 colors whose HSI representations are given as follows: (a) $(pi, 0.3,0.5)$, (b) $(0.5 pi, 0.8,0.3)$, which color is brighter?

Options:

A: Brightness cannot be compared without additional information about the viewing conditions
B: (b) is brighter due to higher hue value
C: Cannot be determined from the given data
D: Brightness is subjective and cannot be determined from HSI values alone
E: (b) is brighter because it has a higher saturation and lower hue value
F: (a)
G: Both are equally bright
H: (b)

Answer:

Okay, so I have this question about HSI color representations and determining which color is brighter. Hmm, HSI stands for Hue, Saturation, Intensity, right? I remember that each of these components plays a role in how we perceive color. Let me think through this step by step.

The two colors given are (a) (π, 0.3, 0.5) and (b) (0.5π, 0.8, 0.3). Wait, wait—HSI components: typically, I think the hue is in radians, saturation and intensity are between 0 and 1. So, for each color, the intensity is the third component. Oh, but wait, sometimes intensity is called brightness in some color spaces. So in HSI, the intensity component is like the brightness—how much light is there. So higher intensity would mean brighter, right?

Looking at the two colors:
- Color (a) has an intensity of 0.5.
- Color (b) has an intensity of 0.3.

So, wait, 0.5 is higher than 0.3. That would mean color (a) has a higher intensity, which should make it brighter than color (b). But wait, I need to make sure I'm understanding the HSI model correctly. In some systems, intensity is the same as the brightness or luminance. So higher intensity means brighter.

But wait, the options don't have (a) as the answer. Let me check the options again. The options are A through H, with F being (a) and H being (b). So if I'm right, (a) is brighter, so option F would be correct. But wait, let me think again because sometimes the intensity might not be the only factor.

Wait a second, maybe I'm mixing up HSI with other color spaces like HSV, where the V stands for value, which is similar to intensity. In HSV, higher value means brighter. So in HSI, higher intensity should mean brighter. So color (a) has 0.5, which is higher than (b)'s 0.3. So (a) is brighter than (b). So the answer should be F, which is (a).

But wait, some people might confuse the role of saturation. Saturation is the purity of the color. Higher saturation means the color is more vivid. But that doesn't directly affect the brightness. So even if color (b) has a higher saturation (0.8 vs 0.3), that makes it more vivid, but lower intensity would make it less bright. So the brightness is determined by the intensity component.

Wait, but the options include E: (b) is brighter because it has higher saturation and lower hue value. That doesn't make sense because saturation doesn't directly affect brightness; it's about the intensity. The hue is the color angle, which could affect perceived brightness, but in HSI, intensity is the main factor.

So the brightness should be determined by the intensity. So (a) is brighter. So the correct answer is F: (a). Therefore, the answer is F.

The brightness of a color in the HSI model is determined by its intensity component. Color (a) has an intensity of 0.5, while color (b) has an intensity of 0.3. Since 0.5 is higher than 0.3, color (a) is brighter. The saturation and hue values do not directly affect brightness in this context. 

Answer: F
