Okay, so I have this question about four-dimensional geometry and the angles of a triangle. Hmm, I remember that in regular geometry, which I think is called Euclidean geometry, the angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees. But wait, the question is about four-dimensional geometry, so that must be different.

Wait, four-dimensional geometry... I'm trying to recall. In higher dimensions, like on a sphere or in hyperbolic space, the sum of angles changes, right? So in two dimensions, flat space, it's 180. But in higher dimensions, like on a sphere (which is a 2D surface in 3D), triangles have angles that add up to more than 180. And in hyperbolic geometry, maybe they add up to less.

But wait, the question is about four-dimensional geometry. So does that mean the same as non-Euclidean? Because four-dimensional space is a type of non-Euclidean geometry. So in four dimensions, the sum of the angles might not be 180 degrees.

Looking at the options, the question is whether the angles add to 180° according to four-dimensional geometry. If four-dimensional geometry is non-Euclidean, then the answer would be that they don't add to 180°. So the statement in the question is false.

Wait, the question says "according to four-dimensional geometry, the angles add to 180°." So is that true? If four-dimensional geometry is a type where the sum isn't 180, then the statement is false. So the correct answer would be that it's never the case. Or wait, when is it the case?

Wait, let me think. In Euclidean geometry, which is our regular flat space (two dimensions), the sum is 180. But in four-dimensional space, which is non-Euclidean, the sum changes. So the angles of a triangle in four dimensions would not add up to 180. So the statement in the question is incorrect. So the answer is that it's never true, which would be option J: never.

But wait, maybe I'm confusing dimensions. Four-dimensional space is a higher-dimensional space, but triangles can exist in any dimension. So a triangle in 4D space is still a three-sided figure, but the geometry is non-Euclidean. So in 4D Euclidean space, it's the same as 3D Euclidean, right? Because Euclidean space in any dimension has the same properties. So in 4D Euclidean space, the sum is still 180. But wait, the question is about four-dimensional geometry, which I think refers to non-Euclidean, like spherical or hyperbolic.

Wait, no. Four-dimensional geometry can include both Euclidean and non-Euclidean. Wait, no, four-dimensional Euclidean space is just higher-dimensional Euclidean. So in Euclidean 4D, the sum is still 180. But if it's non-Euclidean 4D, then it's different. But the question doesn't specify whether it's Euclidean or not.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me try to clarify. The question is about four-dimensional geometry. In four-dimensional Euclidean space, triangles would still have angles summing to 180 degrees because it's just a higher flat space. But if it's non-Euclidean four-dimensional space, like on a 4-sphere or something, then the sum would be different.

Wait, but the question is about four-dimensional geometry in general. So maybe the statement is only true in two-dimensional Euclidean space. So the answer would be that it's only true in two dimensions, which is option E.

Wait, the options are:

E: in two-dimensional space only.

So if the statement is that angles add to 180, which is true in 2D Euclidean, but not in higher dimensions (like 4D non-Euclidean), then the answer would be E. Because the question is about four-dimensional geometry, implying that it's not two-dimensional. So in four-dimensional geometry, the sum isn't 180, so the statement is only true in two dimensions.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "according to four-dimensional geometry, the angles add to 180." So if four-dimensional geometry says that, then it's correct. But I think four-dimensional Euclidean geometry would still have the sum as 180, but non-Euclidean 4D would not.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key is that in Euclidean geometry of any dimension, the sum is 180. So in four-dimensional Euclidean space, it's still 180. But the question is about four-dimensional geometry, which could be either. So if the question is in four-dimensional geometry, is the sum 180? Well, it depends on whether it's Euclidean or not.

But the options don't specify; they just say four-dimensional geometry. So perhaps the answer is that it's not always true. Because in four-dimensional Euclidean, it's 180, but in four-dimensional non-Euclidean, it's not. So the statement isn't always true in four-dimensional geometry. So the answer would be G: sometimes.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "according to four-dimensional geometry." So maybe it's referring to non-Euclidean four-dimensional geometry, in which case the sum isn't 180. Or if it's Euclidean, it is. So the statement is sometimes true, depending on the type of four-dimensional geometry.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe four-dimensional geometry is a broader term that includes both Euclidean and non-Euclidean. So the statement isn't always true in four-dimensional geometry.

Wait, the options are:

A: when equilateral
B: always
C: when isosceles
D: on Earth only
E: in 2D only
F: in non-Euclidean only
G: sometimes
H: when right-angled
I: in 3D only
J: never

So the question is, does four-dimensional geometry say that the angles add to 180? The answer would be that it's not always the case; it depends. So the correct answer is G: sometimes.

Wait, but in four-dimensional Euclidean space, the sum is 180, but in four-dimensional non-Euclidean, it's not. So four-dimensional geometry can include both, so the statement is sometimes true. So G is the answer.

Alternatively, if the question is assuming non-Euclidean four-dimensional geometry, then the sum isn't 180, so the statement is false, making J the answer.

But I'm not certain. Maybe I should think about the options again. The question is whether, according to four-dimensional geometry, the sum is 180. If four-dimensional geometry includes both Euclidean and non-Euclidean, then sometimes it's true. So the answer is G.

Wait, but four-dimensional geometry is a specific field. I think the default assumption is that four-dimensional geometry refers to the study of 4D spaces, which could be Euclidean or non-Euclidean. So the statement is only true in four-dimensional Euclidean space, but not in non-Euclidean. Therefore, the statement isn't always true in four-dimensional geometry. So the answer is G: sometimes.

Alternatively, if the question is implying that four-dimensional geometry is non-Euclidean, then the statement is false, so J is the answer.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me see. In Euclidean geometry, regardless of the dimension, the sum is 180. So in 4D Euclidean space, it's still 180. But if you're in a non-Euclidean four-dimensional space, like spherical or hyperbolic, the sum changes. So the statement is true in 4D Euclidean but false in non-Euclidean 4D.

Therefore, in four-dimensional geometry, the statement is sometimes true. So the answer is G: sometimes.

The question asks whether, according to four-dimensional geometry, the angles of a triangle add to 180°. In Euclidean geometry, regardless of the dimension, the sum of the angles of a triangle is always 180°. Therefore, in four-dimensional Euclidean space, the sum remains 180°. However, in non-Euclidean four-dimensional geometry, such as spherical or hyperbolic spaces, the sum of the angles can differ from 180°. Since the question does not specify whether it refers to Euclidean or non-Euclidean four-dimensional geometry, the statement is not always true. It is only true in four-dimensional Euclidean space but not in non-Euclidean four-dimensional spaces. Thus, the correct answer is that the statement is sometimes true.

Answer: G
