Question:

Dr. Sam Solo is the only psychologist in a small town, and his son is enrolled in the town's only elementary school. Dr. Solo receives a call from his son's teacher who says she would like to begin therapy with him. As an ethical psychologist, Dr. Solo should:

Options:

A: tell the teacher that he can only see her if she agrees to switch his son to a different class.
B: begin therapy with her but avoid discussing his son or any school-related matters.
C: begin therapy with her and discuss the potential for conflicts during the initial session and, if necessary, in subsequent sessions.
D: suggest that the teacher seek therapy with a different professional to avoid any potential conflict of interest.
E: refuse therapy and refer her to a psychologist in a neighboring town.
F: accept the teacher as a client, but only after discussing the situation with the school board.
G: tell the teacher that he is ethically prohibited from seeing her because to do so would constitute a multiple (dual) relationship.

Okay, so I've got this question about Dr. Sam Solo, a psychologist in a small town. His son is in the only elementary school there, and the teacher wants to start therapy with him. I need to figure out what's the most ethical choice for Dr. Solo.

Hmm, I remember that ethical guidelines for psychologists often talk about avoiding dual relationships. A dual relationship is when a psychologist has more than one role with a person, which can complicate things. In this case, Dr. Solo is the son's father and the teacher wants to be his client. That's a problem because it could create a conflict of interest.

Option A says he can only see her if she switches his son's class. That doesn't seem right because that's making a condition on his services, which might not be the best approach. Plus, it could put pressure on the teacher to do something she might not want.

Option B suggests he starts therapy and avoids talking about his son or school stuff. But that's probably not possible because the teacher's role is connected to the school, and the therapy might naturally involve discussing the son, especially if the teacher is seeking help for issues related to him.

Option C is about beginning therapy but discussing potential conflicts in the initial and subsequent sessions. That sounds better because it's about being transparent and addressing any issues that might come up. It's proactive to talk about it early on.

Option D advises suggesting another professional to avoid conflict. That makes sense because having a dual relationship could impair his judgment or lead to unfair treatment. Referring her elsewhere would prevent that.

Option E is refusing therapy and referring her elsewhere. That seems similar to D but more direct. But maybe he could still provide therapy if certain conditions are met, like discussing the potential issues.

Option F is accepting her as a client after discussing with the school board. That feels a bit like getting permission from an authority, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. It might not address the ethical conflict directly.

Option G says he's ethically prohibited because it's a dual relationship. That seems correct because having a client who's his son's teacher creates a clear dual relationship, which is typically frowned upon in psychology.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. On one hand, G seems to state the clear ethical rule against dual relationships. On the other hand, C suggests discussing the potential conflicts, which is a way to manage them. But can you manage a dual relationship by just discussing it, or does the mere existence of it create an ethical violation regardless of discussion?

I think the key here is that dual relationships are generally discouraged unless they can be managed without harm. But in this case, since Dr. Solo is the father of the student, and the teacher is seeking therapy, it's a clear dual relationship. So the best course might be to refuse therapy and refer her elsewhere, which is option D or E.

Wait, let me think again. The APA ethics code (I think) says that a dual relationship is prohibited unless it's clearly necessary and the potential for harm is minimal. But in this case, it's a straightforward dual relationship because he's the child's parent and she's the teacher. So it's better to avoid it.

So between D and E: D suggests she seek another therapist, which is a good approach. E says refuse and refer to a neighboring town. But since it's a small town, maybe the neighboring town isn't much further away, but the main point is to avoid the dual relationship.

Alternatively, G says he's ethically prohibited, so he can't see her at all. That would be the most strict interpretation. But some might argue that discussing the conflict upfront could be a way to manage it, but I'm not sure if that's allowed.

I'm a bit torn between C and G. But I think the correct answer is G because dual relationships are typically prohibited, and the best course is to decline to avoid the conflict.

Dr. Sam Solo faces an ethical dilemma as a psychologist in a small town where he is the only psychologist and his son's teacher seeks therapy. Dual relationships, such as being both a parent and a therapist to a client who is a child's teacher, are generally prohibited due to the potential for conflict of interest and impaired judgment. While discussing potential conflicts (Option C) might seem proactive, the ethical guidelines typically require avoiding such relationships altogether. Therefore, the most appropriate action is for Dr. Solo to refuse therapy and refer the teacher to another professional to prevent any ethical violations.
