Okay, so I've got this question about δβ-thalassaemia and its mutational mechanism. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that thalassaemia is a group of disorders affecting hemoglobin production. There are different types, like α and β thalassaemia, and each can have subtypes. δβ-thalassaemia is a specific form. I think it has something to do with mutations in the beta globin gene.

Wait, δβ-thalassaemia, right. So, the delta and beta parts. I recall that beta thalassaemia is more common. The delta globin chain is part of the hemoglobin, but if there's a mutation there, it might affect the production of delta globin.

Now, the question is about the mutational mechanism. The options are various types of mutations: frame shift, missense, silent, inversion, point, deletion, insertion, nonsense, duplication, translocation.

I think δβ-thalassaemia is caused by a specific type of mutation. I remember that in some cases, like beta thalassaemia minor, it's often a point mutation. Point mutations are changes in a single nucleotide. For example, in beta thalassaemia, a point mutation might lead to a stop codon, causing the chain to be shorter or not produced at all.

Wait, δβ-thalassaemia specifically affects the delta globin gene. So, the mutation is in that gene. If it's a point mutation, that could lead to a premature stop codon, which would result in no functional delta globin. That makes sense because the delta globin is part of hemoglobin A, so its absence would cause issues in hemoglobin production.

Let me think about the other options. A frame shift mutation would change the reading frame, leading to a completely different amino acid sequence from the mutation point onward. That's more common in diseases where a large portion of the protein is messed up, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Missense mutations change an amino acid, but if it's a silent mutation, it doesn't change the amino acid. Nonsense is a premature stop codon, which is similar to what I was thinking with a point mutation. So a point mutation could be a type of missense or nonsense, but in this case, the delta globin isn't made, so it's more likely a nonsense mutation leading to a truncated protein.

Wait, no. The question is about the mechanism, not the effect. So a point mutation is a single nucleotide change. So if the mutation is a point mutation that causes a stop codon, that would be a nonsense mutation. But perhaps the question is more about the type of mutation, not the consequence. So δβ-thalassaemia is typically caused by a point mutation in the delta globin gene.

I think that's right. So looking at the options, E is point mutation. So the answer would be E.

Alternatively, could it be a deletion or insertion? Those are bigger changes. I don't think δβ is usually caused by such mutations; it's more often a single nucleotide change.

The mutational mechanism in δβ-thalassaemia involves a point mutation in the delta globin gene, typically resulting in a premature stop codon and subsequent absence of functional delta globin. This aligns with the nature of point mutations, which involve a single nucleotide change.

Answer: E
