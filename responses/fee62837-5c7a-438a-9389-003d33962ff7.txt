Okay, so I have this question about linear transformations, and I need to figure out which of the statements I, II, or III must be true. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The problem says that V is a finite-dimensional real vector space, and P is a linear transformation such that P squared equals P. So, P² = P. I remember that this kind of transformation is called an idempotent transformation. 

Now, let's look at each of the statements one by one.

Statement I: P is invertible. Hmm, I'm not so sure about this. If P were invertible, then there would exist another transformation Q such that PQ = QP = I, where I is the identity transformation. But if P² = P, then applying P twice is the same as applying it once. Let's see if this implies invertibility.

Suppose P is invertible. Then we can multiply both sides of P² = P by P⁻¹. On the left side, P² times P⁻¹ would be P (since P² * P⁻¹ = P). On the right side, P * P⁻¹ would be I. So that would give P = I. So if P is invertible, it must be the identity. But wait, is that the only possibility?

Alternatively, what if P is not invertible? Let's think. If P is not invertible, its determinant is zero. Then P² = P implies that the determinant of P squared is determinant of P. But determinant is multiplicative, so det(P²) = (det P)^2. So (det P)^2 = det P. Therefore, det P is either 0 or 1. So if P is invertible, det P must be 1. But if det P is 0, P is not invertible. So P can't always be invertible because it could be the zero transformation, which has determinant zero and is definitely not invertible. So statement I is not necessarily true. So I can conclude that statement I is false.

Moving on to statement II: P is diagonalizable. I'm trying to remember about diagonalization. A linear transformation is diagonalizable if there exists a basis consisting of eigenvectors of P. Since P² = P, the minimal polynomial of P must divide x² - x, which factors into x(x-1). So the minimal polynomial has distinct linear factors, which implies that P is diagonalizable. Because if the minimal polynomial has no repeated roots, the transformation is diagonalizable. So statement II must be true.

Wait, but I should double-check. Suppose P is idempotent, so P² = P. Then the minimal polynomial divides x² - x, which splits into distinct linear factors, so by the theorem, P is diagonalizable. So yes, statement II is correct.

Statement III: P is either the identity transformation or the zero transformation. Hmm, I'm not sure about this. Let's see. The identity transformation satisfies I² = I, and the zero transformation satisfies 0² = 0, so those are certainly examples. But are there other transformations that are idempotent besides identity and zero?

Yes, for example, consider projection operators. If you take a vector space V and a subspace W, then the projection onto W along its complement is an idempotent transformation. Unless W is the entire space (which would make the projection the identity) or the zero subspace (which would make the projection zero), the projection isn't identity or zero. So P can be a projection onto a subspace that isn't the whole space or just zero. Therefore, statement III is false.

So putting it all together: Statement I is false, II is true, III is false.

Now, the options: Looking at the options, option B is "II only." So the correct answer should be B.

The correct answer is B: II only.

Answer: B
