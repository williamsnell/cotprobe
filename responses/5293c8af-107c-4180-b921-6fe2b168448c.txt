Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the density function ρ(r) of a sphere where the field vector is independent of the radial distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that when dealing with fields inside a sphere, like maybe gravitational or electric fields, Gauss's Law is often useful. Gauss's Law relates the field to the charge (or mass, in the case of gravity) enclosed within a certain radius.

Wait, the problem says the field vector is independent of the radial distance. So that means the field is the same everywhere inside the sphere, right? So for a gravitational field, that would mean the gravitational acceleration g is constant throughout the sphere's interior.

I think for a uniform gravitational field inside a sphere, Gauss's Law would apply. The gravitational field at radius r inside the sphere would depend only on the mass enclosed within that radius. But since the field is uniform, the mass enclosed must be proportional to r^3, maybe? Because the gravitational field inside a uniform density sphere usually varies with r, but in this case, it's constant, so perhaps the density isn't uniform. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me get this straight. The field is constant, so the gravitational acceleration g is constant. From Gauss's Law, the gravitational field at radius r is given by g = (G M_enclosed) / r^2, but if g is constant, then M_enclosed must be proportional to r^2. Because if g = constant, then M_enclosed = (g r^2) / G.

But M_enclosed is the integral of density from 0 to r. So M_enclosed = integral from 0 to r of ρ(r') * 4π r'^2 dr'. If M_enclosed = (g r^2)/G, then substituting, we get:

(g r^2)/G = ∫ (from 0 to r) ρ(r') 4π r'^2 dr'

Let's call C = g/(4πG) to simplify the equation. So the integral becomes:

C r^2 = ∫ (from 0 to r) ρ(r') 4π r'^2 dr'

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me re-express it. If M_enclosed = (g r^2)/G, and M_enclosed is the integral of density over the volume, which is ∫ρ(r) * 4π r'^2 dr' from 0 to r, then maybe I should set up the equation correctly.

So, M_enclosed = (g r^2)/G = ∫ (from 0 to r) ρ(r) 4π r'^2 dr'

Let me take the derivative of both sides with respect to r to find ρ(r). The derivative of M_enclosed with respect to r is ρ(r) * 4π r^2. On the other side, the derivative of (g r^2)/G is (2g r)/G.

So:

ρ(r) * 4π r^2 = (2g r)/G

Divide both sides by 4π r^2:

ρ(r) = (2g r) / (4π G r^2) ) = (g) / (2π G r)

Hmm, but wait, this gives ρ proportional to 1/r. Let me see the options. Option B is (1/(4π)) (C)/(G r), and option I is (2/π)(C)/(G r). Wait, but in our case, we have g expressed in terms of C. Wait, perhaps I should express g as a constant multiplied by some factor.

Wait, the problem states that the field vector is independent of radial distance, so the field is uniform. So let's say the field is g = C, where C is some constant. Then, M_enclosed = (C r^2)/G.

Taking the derivative, as before, we get:

dM/dr = ρ(r) * 4π r^2 = (2 C r)/G

So, ρ(r) = (2 C r) / (4 π G r^2) ) = (C) / (2 π G r )

Wait, that's ρ(r) = C/(2 π G r). Looking at the options, option I is (2/π)(C)/(G r), which would be (2C)/(π G r), but I have C/(2 π G r). That doesn't match any option directly. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should check my steps again. So, I have:

M_enclosed = (g r^2)/G = ∫0^r [ρ(r') * 4 π r'^2] dr'

Differentiating both sides with respect to r gives:

dM/dr = ρ(r) * 4 π r^2 = (2 g r)/G

So, ρ(r) = (2 g r) / (4 π G r^2) ) = g/(2 π G r)

But g is given as a constant, so perhaps in terms of C, where C is g, then ρ(r) = C/(2 π G r). Looking at the options:

Option E is (1/(2 π)) * (C)/(G r) which is same as (C)/(2 π G r). So that's option E.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Oh wait, option E is (1/(2 π)) (C)/(G r), so that's exactly what I got. So the answer should be option E.

But wait, another approach: sometimes for gravitational fields, the density for a constant field is given by ρ = (3g)/(8 π G) * (1/r), but I might be mixing something up. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the total mass enclosed.

Wait, another approach: the gravitational field inside a sphere is given by g(r) = (G M(r))/(r^2). If g is constant, then M(r) must be proportional to r^2. So M(r) = k r^2, where k is a constant.

But M(r) is the integral from 0 to r of ρ(r') * 4 π r'^2 dr' = 4 π ∫0^r ρ(r') r'^2 dr'.

So if M(r) = k r^2, then 4 π ∫0^r ρ(r') r'^2 dr' = k r^2.

Differentiating both sides with respect to r gives 4 π r^2 ρ(r) = 2 k r.

So ρ(r) = (2 k r) / (4 π r^2) ) = k/(2 π r).

So, ρ(r) = (k)/(2 π r).

Now, what is k in terms of g? Since g = G M(r)/r^2, and M(r) = k r^2, then g = G (k r^2) / r^2 = G k → k = g/(G).

So substituting back, ρ(r) = (g/(G)) / (2 π r) ) = g/(2 π G r).

So again, ρ(r) = (g)/(2 π G r), which matches option E.

So the correct answer should be option E: (1/(2 π)) (C)/(G r), assuming C = g.

The problem involves finding the density function $\rho(r)$ of a sphere where the gravitational field vector is constant and independent of the radial distance. Using Gauss's Law, the gravitational field inside the sphere is related to the mass enclosed, $M(r)$, by $g(r) = \frac{G M(r)}{r^2}$. Since the field is constant, $M(r)$ must be proportional to $r^2$, i.e., $M(r) = k r^2$, where $k$ is a constant. Substituting this into the expression for $M(r)$ as an integral of $\rho(r)$ leads to:

\[
4\pi \int_0^r \rho(r') r'^2 dr' = k r^2.
\]

Differentiating both sides with respect to $r$ gives:

\[
4\pi r^2 \rho(r) = 2k r,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
\rho(r) = \frac{k}{2\pi r}.
\]

Expressing $k$ in terms of the gravitational field $g$, where $g = Gk$, we find $k = \frac{g}{G}$. Substituting this back, the density function becomes:

\[
\rho(r) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \frac{C}{G r},
\]

where $C$ represents the constant gravitational field. Comparing this with the options, the correct choice is:

E: $\frac{1}{2 \pi} \frac{C}{G r}$.
