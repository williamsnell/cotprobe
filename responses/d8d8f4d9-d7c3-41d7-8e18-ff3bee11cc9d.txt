Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a charged nonconducting rod. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the rod is 2.00 meters long, and its cross-sectional area is 4.00 cm². It's lying along the positive x-axis, starting at the origin. The charge density rho is given as -4.00 microcoulombs per cubic meter. The question is asking how many excess electrons are on the rod.

Wait, so I remember that charge density rho is charge per unit volume. So, the total charge Q on the rod should be rho multiplied by the volume of the rod. Oh right, because volume is length times area, but area is in cm² and I think I need to convert that to m² to keep the units consistent.

Let me jot down the given values:

Length, L = 2.00 m
Cross-sectional area, A = 4.00 cm². Oh wait, 1 cm² is (0.01 m)^2, so 4 cm² is 4*(0.01)^2 m². Let me calculate that: 0.01 squared is 0.0001, times 4 is 0.0004 m². So A = 0.0004 m².

Charge density, rho = -4.00 μC/m³. Oh, microcoulombs. I need to convert that to coulombs. Micro is 1e-6, so 4.00e-6 C/m³. But wait, the value is negative, which probably indicates that it's a negative charge, so excess electrons.

So the volume V is L * A. Let's compute that. V = 2.00 m * 0.0004 m² = 0.0008 m³. Wait, 2 times 0.0004 is 0.0008? Wait, 2 * 0.0004 is 0.0008, yes. So V = 0.0008 m³.

Now, the total charge Q is rho * V. So plugging in the numbers: Q = (-4.00e-6 C/m³) * 0.0008 m³. Let me compute that. 4e-6 times 8e-4. Let me see, 4e-6 * 0.0008 is 4e-6 * 8e-4 = (4*8) * 1e-10 = 32e-10 C, which is 3.2e-9 C. So Q = -3.2e-9 C.

Wait, but since it's negative, that means it's electrons. Now, each electron has a charge of -e, where e is 1.602e-19 C. So the number of electrons N is Q divided by (-e). But since Q is negative, that will give a positive number of electrons.

Wait, let me check: Q = n * e, but since Q is negative, n is positive. So N = |Q| / e.

So |Q| is 3.2e-9 C. Divide that by 1.602e-19 C/electron.

Calculating: (3.2e-9) / (1.602e-19) = approximately (3.2 / 1.602) * 1e10. Let's compute 3.2 / 1.602. Hmm, 1.602 times 2 is about 3.204, so it's almost 2. So approximately 2 * 1e10, which is 2e10 electrons. Wait, but let me be more precise.

Wait, 3.2 / 1.602 is exactly 3.2 ÷ 1.602. Let me compute that. 1.602 * 2 = 3.204, which is just a bit more than 3.2, so 3.2 /1.602 ≈ 1.9975. So approximately 1.9975e10, which is about 2.00e10 electrons.

Looking at the options, option H is 2.00e10 electrons. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, when I computed V: L is 2.00 m, A is 4 cm² which is 0.0004 m². So 2 m * 0.0004 m² is 0.0008 m³, correct. Then rho is -4e-6 C/m³, so Q = -4e-6 * 0.0008.

Wait, 0.0008 is 8e-4. So 4e-6 * 8e-4 = (4*8) * 1e-10 =32e-10, which is 3.2e-9 C. Yes, that's correct.

Then number of electrons N is |Q| / e = 3.2e-9 / 1.602e-19 = (3.2 /1.602) * 1e10. As before, 3.2 /1.602 is about 1.9975, so 2.00e10. So the answer should be H.

To determine the number of excess electrons on the rod, we start by calculating the total charge \( Q \) using the formula \( Q = \rho \cdot V \). The volume \( V \) is given by \( V = L \cdot A \), where \( L = 2.00 \, \mathrm{m} \) and \( A = 4.00 \, \mathrm{cm}^2 = 0.0004 \, \mathrm{m}^2 \). Thus, \( V = 2.00 \, \mathrm{m} \cdot 0.0004 \, \mathrm{m}^2 = 0.0008 \, \mathrm{m}^3 \).

The charge density is \( \rho = -4.00 \, \mu\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{m}^3 = -4.00 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C}/\mathrm{m}^3 \). Substituting into the formula for \( Q \), we get:

\[
Q = (-4.00 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C}/\mathrm{m}^3) \cdot (0.0008 \, \mathrm{m}^3) = -3.2 \times 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{C}.
\]

Since the charge is negative, it corresponds to excess electrons. The number of electrons \( N \) is given by \( N = |Q| / e \), where \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C} \) is the charge of a single electron. Substituting the values:

\[
N = \frac{3.2 \times 10^{-9}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.00 \times 10^{10}.
\]

Thus, the number of excess electrons on the rod is \( 2.00 \times 10^{10} \), corresponding to option H.
