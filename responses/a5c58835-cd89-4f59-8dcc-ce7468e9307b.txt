Okay, so I've got this T4 phage genetics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by breaking down the question step by step.

First, the setup: T4 phages that have mutations in the rII region. I remember that the rII region is involved in replication control. Phages with mutations here can cause lysis in E. coli strain B but not strain K. So, the phages are able to infect and lyse B but not K. That probably means that the phages can't replicate properly in K, maybe because K has some resistance or because the phage's replication genes aren't working right.

Now, the experiment: A plate of E. coli strain B is infected with two types of mutant phages simultaneously. So, two different phage mutants are mixed and used to infect the same bacterial lawn. After some incubation, the lysate is made, meaning the bacteria are broken open, releasing the phages.

The lysate is then divided into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated onto strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated onto strain K. They found 4 plaques on K and 40 on B.

The question is about determining the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the rII region of the T4 genome. Recombination, in this context, refers to the exchange of genetic material between the two phage genomes, leading to new combinations of mutations. The percentage of recombinant phages will tell us how often this recombination happened.

So, I think the approach here involves calculating the number of phages that can infect each strain and then figuring out how much recombination has occurred based on the number of plaques.

Let me outline the steps I think I need to take:

1. Determine the number of each type of phage in the lysate.
2. Calculate the total number of phages in the lysate.
3. Use the dilution and plating data to find out how many of each phage type are present.
4. Use the number of plaques on each plate to find out the proportion of each phage type.
5. Calculate the recombination frequency based on the data.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about how to model this. Let's think again.

The two phages are mutants. Let's call them Phage A and Phage B. Each has a mutation in the rII region. Since they can't infect K, but can infect B, each phage alone would lyse B but not K. However, if recombination occurs between them, perhaps the resulting phages can infect both strains. Wait, no. Because if they recombine, the phages could have new combinations of mutations. But wait, the problem states that the phages can cause lysis in B but not K. So, perhaps each phage has a mutation that makes them unable to replicate in K. So, if a phage has both mutations, or perhaps a single mutation? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The rII region is involved in replication control. Phages with mutations in rII can't form small, clear plaques because they can't replicate properly, perhaps? Or maybe it's about their ability to replicate in certain E. coli strains.

Wait, I think that in E. coli, the rII region determines whether the phage can replicate. There's something called the "replication control" where the phage's rII region interacts with the host's replication machinery. So, I think that E. coli B and K have different replication genes, so the phage's rII mutation affects whether it can replicate in each strain.

Wait, I remember that E. coli B and K are different in their replication origins. For T4 phages, the rII region determines the origin of replication. So, if the phage has a mutation in rII, it can't replicate in E. coli K, but can in B. So, if a phage is rII mutant, it can't form plaques on K because it can't replicate, but can on B.

But wait, the question says that the phages can cause the lysis of B but not K. So, when they infect B, they can lyse it, but when they infect K, they can't. So, the phages are able to infect both strains but can only replicate in B. Therefore, on a lawn of B, they would form lysed areas (plaques), but on K, they don't, because they can't replicate. Unless... unless some phages have undergone recombination that allows them to replicate in K.

Wait, but the initial phages are mutants, so perhaps each has a different mutation in rII. Let's say Phage 1 has mutation A and Phage 2 has mutation B. If they infect the same cell, and recombination occurs, then some phages may get a mix of the mutations. But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe the two phages are each unable to replicate in K, but when they recombine, the resulting phage can replicate in both B and K. So, on a plate of K, only the recombinant phages would form plaques, while the parental phages would not. Because the parental phages can't infect K, but the recombinants can.

Wait, but the question states that the lysate is made from infecting B. So, the lysate contains phages that have been replicated in B. When the lysate is split, one half is plated on B, the other on K. So, on K, only the phages that can replicate (i.e., the recombinants) would form plaques.

Wait, but how does that work? Let me think. The initial infection is on B. The phages replicate in B, so each phage in the lysate is either a mutant (from parent A or B) or a recombinant that can infect K.

So, when you plate the lysate on K, only the recombinant phages can form plaques. Because the parental phages can't replicate in K.

So, the number of plaques on K (4) would correspond to the number of recombinant phages. The number on B (40) would correspond to the total number of phages, because any phage can infect B and replicate.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because when you plate the lysate onto B, any phage (whether parental or recombinant) can infect and cause lysis. So the 40 plaques on B are the total number of phages in that dilution.

Wait, but the lysate is split into two. Let me get the dilutions right.

The lysate is divided into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on B. The other is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on K.

So, for the B plate: dilution 1e-7, and 40 plaques.

For the K plate: dilution 1e-5, and 4 plaques.

Wait, but to find the number of phages per mL, I think I can use the formula: number of plaques = (dilution factor) * (number of phages in the lysate) * (volume plated).

But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the concentration of phages in the lysate.

Let me denote the total number of phages in the lysate as N.

When half is diluted 1:10^7, the concentration in the plate is N/(2 * 1e7). Similarly, the other half is diluted 1:1e5, so concentration is N/(2 * 1e5).

But wait, when you dilute a sample, you take a portion and dilute it. So, the total number in the lysate is N. Then, each half is N/2.

So, for the B plate: take N/2 phages, dilute 1:1e7, so the concentration is (N/2) / 1e7. When plated, the number of plaques is proportional to this concentration.

Similarly, the K plate: take N/2, dilute 1:1e5, so concentration is (N/2)/1e5.

But wait, on the K plate, only the recombinant phages can form plaques. Let me think about this.

Let me denote:

- Let r be the fraction of phages in the lysate that are recombinant (i.e., can infect K).

- Then, the total number of phages in the lysate is N.

- The number of recombinant phages is r*N.

When we plate on K, only the recombinant phages will form plaques. So, the number of plaques on K is (r*N/2) / 1e5.

Similarly, on B, any phage can form a plaque, so the number of plaques is (N/2)/1e7.

Given that:

Number of plaques on B: 40 = (N/2) / 1e7 → 40 = N/(2e7) → N = 40 * 2e7 → N = 8e8 phages in the lysate.

Number of plaques on K: 4 = (r*N/2) / 1e5 → 4 = (r*8e8/2) /1e5 → 4 = (4e8 r) / 1e5 → 4 = 4e3 r → r = 4 / 4e3 → r = 0.001, or 0.1%.

Wait, so the fraction of recombinant phages is 0.1%, which is 0.001. That would be option I: 0.02%? Wait, no. Wait, 0.1% is 0.001 as a decimal. Let me check the options:

Options include I: 0.02% (0.0002) and J: 0.05% (0.0005), and D: 0.1% (0.001). Oh, wait yes, D is 0.1%.

Wait, but the question is asking for the amount of recombination between the two mutations. Recombination frequency is typically calculated as the percentage of recombinant offspring, which would be 0.1% as per the calculation. So that would be option D: 0.1%.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check the calculations.

From the B plate:

Number of plaques (40) equals (N/2) / 1e7.

So, 40 = (N/2) / 1e7 → N/2 = 40 * 1e7 → N = 80 * 1e7 → N = 8e8 phages.

From the K plate:

Number of plaques (4) equals (r*N/2) / 1e5.

So, 4 = (r * 8e8 / 2) /1e5 → 4 = (4e8 r) / 1e5 → 4 = 4e3 r → r = 4 / 4e3 → r = 0.001 → 0.1%.

Yes, that makes sense. So the recombination frequency is 0.1%, which is option D.

The experiment involves infecting E. coli strain B with two mutant T4 phages that have mutations in the rII region. These mutations allow the phages to lyse strain B but not strain K. After infection, the lysate is divided into two halves, diluted, and plated onto lawns of E. coli B and K. The number of plaques formed on each strain is used to determine the recombination frequency between the two mutations in the rII region.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Total Number of Phages in the Lysate (N):**
   - On strain B, 40 plaques are observed after a 1:10^7 dilution.  
     Using the formula:  
     \[
     \text{Plaques on B} = \frac{N/2}{10^7}
     \]  
     Solving for \( N \):  
     \[
     40 = \frac{N/2}{10^7} \implies N = 40 \times 2 \times 10^7 = 8 \times 10^8
     \]

2. **Fraction of Recombinant Phages (r):**
   - On strain K, 4 plaques are observed after a 1:10^5 dilution.  
     Only recombinant phages can infect and lyse strain K. Using the formula:  
     \[
     \text{Plaques on K} = \frac{r \cdot N/2}{10^5}
     \]  
     Substituting \( N = 8 \times 10^8 \):  
     \[
     4 = \frac{r \cdot 8 \times 10^8 / 2}{10^5} \implies 4 = \frac{4 \times 10^8 \cdot r}{10^5} \implies r = \frac{4}{4 \times 10^3} = 0.001
     \]

3. **Recombination Frequency:**
   - The fraction of recombinant phages is \( r = 0.001 \), which corresponds to 0.1%.

### Conclusion:
The recombination frequency between the two mutations in the rII region of the T4 genome is **0.1%**.
