Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out which carpet width is more economical for a room. The room is 14 feet 6 inches by 11 feet 3 inches. The price is $11.95 per square yard. The available widths are 15 feet and 12 feet. I need to determine which width is more economical and what the total cost would be.

First, I think I should calculate the area of the room in square yards because the price is given per square yard. But wait, the room dimensions are in feet and inches, so I need to convert them into yards or just calculate in feet and then convert to yards.

Let me start by converting the room dimensions into feet only. 14 feet 6 inches is the same as 14.5 feet because 6 inches is half a foot. Similarly, 11 feet 3 inches is 11.25 feet (since 3 inches is a quarter of a foot).

So the room is 14.5 ft by 11.25 ft. To find the area in square feet, I multiply these two: 14.5 * 11.25. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 14 * 11 is 154, and 0.5 * 11.25 is 5.625, so adding them together, that's 159.625 square feet.

Wait, but the price is per square yard, so I need to convert square feet to square yards. I remember that 1 yard is 3 feet, so 1 square yard is 9 square feet. Therefore, to get the area in square yards, I divide the square feet by 9.

So 159.625 / 9 equals approximately 17.736 square yards. Let me double-check that calculation. 9 * 17 is 153, 9 * 17.736 would be around 159.624, so yes, that's correct.

Now, the price is $11.95 per square yard. So the total cost is 17.736 * 11.95. Let me compute that. 17 * 11.95 is 203.15, and 0.736 * 11.95 is about 8.81. Adding them together gives around 211.96. So the total cost without considering the carpet width would be approximately $211.96. But wait, I think I'm missing something because the answer options don't include this amount. Maybe I should approach it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the carpet rolls. The width options are 15 feet and 12 feet. So when you buy carpet, you have to buy it in rolls of a certain width, and you need to calculate how much length you need to cover the area of the room.

Let me think: the area of the room is 14.5 ft by 11.25 ft, which is 162.375 square feet, wait no, wait, earlier I had 14.5 * 11.25 as 162.375 square feet? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 14.5 * 11.25: let me calculate that again. 14 * 11 is 154, 14 * 0.25 is 3.5, 0.5 * 11 is 5.5, and 0.5 * 0.25 is 0.125. So adding all up: 154 +3.5=157.5, +5.5=163, +0.125=163.125. So 14.5 * 11.25 is 163.125 square feet. Oh, I think I made a mistake earlier. So the area is 163.125 square feet.

Now, converting that to square yards: 163.125 / 9 = 18.125 square yards. So the area is 18.125 square yards.

Now, the price is $11.95 per square yard, so the total cost without considering the width would be 18.125 * 11.95. Let me calculate that: 18 * 11.95 is 215.10, and 0.125 *11.95 is 1.49375. So total is approximately 216.59375, so about $216.59. But again, the answer options don't have this. Maybe the approach should be different because the way the carpet is cut affects the amount needed.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Because when you buy carpet by the roll, you have to consider the width and the length. So the area of the carpet you buy is width (in feet) multiplied by length (in feet), then converted to square yards. But the room's area is 14'6" by 11'3", which is 14.5 ft by 11.25 ft, so 163.125 sq ft, which is 18.125 sq yd.

But the carpet comes in rolls of 15' or 12' width. So to cover the room, you need to calculate how much length of each roll is needed to cover the area.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of the area of the room and the width of the carpet to find out how much length is needed, then calculate the total area of the carpet used and multiply by the price.

Wait, but the problem is that the carpet must cover the entire floor, so you have to consider the dimensions and how the carpet is cut. For example, if the room is 14.5' by 11.25', and the carpet comes in 15' width, then the length needed would be the length of the room divided by the width of the carpet. Or perhaps it's the other way around.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the carpet as being unrolled in a certain width, and then the length needed would be the length of the room. Alternatively, maybe the width of the carpet is the width of the roll, so you'd need to cover the room's length in the other dimension.

Wait, maybe I should visualize it. The room is 14.5' wide and 11.25' long. The carpet comes in rolls that are 15' or 12' wide. So if I choose a 15' wide carpet, then the length needed would be the length of the room, 11.25'. Because the carpet is 15' wide, which is wider than the room's width of 14.5', so you can cover the 14.5' width with the 15' carpet, and the length needed is 11.25'.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because 15' is the width of the carpet roll, so perhaps the carpet's length would need to cover the room's length, but the width of the carpet would be 15', which is more than the room's 14.5' width. So in that case, you'd need a carpet piece that is 15' wide and 11.25' long.

So the area of the carpet needed would be 15' * 11.25' = 168.75 square feet. Convert that to square yards: 168.75 /9 = 18.75 sq yd. Then the cost is 18.75 * 11.95 = let's calculate that. 18 * 11.95 is 215.10, 0.75 *11.95 is 8.9625, total is 224.0625, so approximately $224.06.

Alternatively, if I choose a 12' wide carpet, the room is 14.5' wide, so I'd need multiple strips. Because 12' is less than 14.5', so I'd need to cover the 14.5' width with 12' wide carpet, which would require two strips of 12' each, but that's not efficient. Wait, no, perhaps I should think of it as the length of the carpet needed in the direction perpendicular to the width.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try again.

The room is 14.5' wide (along the width) and 11.25' long (along the length). The carpet comes in rolls of 15' or 12' width. So if I choose a 15' width carpet, the carpet's width is 15', which is wider than the room's 14.5' width. So I can cut a piece of carpet that is 15' wide and 11.25' long, which would cover the entire area.

So the area of the carpet needed is 15 * 11.25 = 168.75 sq ft, which is 18.75 sq yd. The cost would be 18.75 * 11.95 = $224.06.

Now, if I choose the 12' width carpet, the carpet is 12' wide, which is less than the room's 14.5' width. So I need to cover the 14.5' width with 12' wide carpet. How? Well, perhaps I would need to have the carpet run along the length of the room. Wait, but that might require more carpet.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate how much length of the 12' wide carpet is needed to cover the 14.5' width of the room. So if the carpet is 12' wide, and the room is 14.5' wide, then the carpet's width is 12', so to cover 14.5', I would need to have the carpet run along the length of the room, but perhaps the calculation is different.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the carpet as covering the room's area, so the area of the carpet needed is the same as the room's area, but the way it's cut affects the amount of carpet used. So, for the 12' width, the length needed would be the room's length divided by the carpet's width. Wait, no, that might not be correct.

Alternatively, maybe the length of the carpet needed is the room's length, and the width of the carpet is 12', but the room's width is 14.5', so I would need to have multiple strips of 12' width to cover the 14.5' width. But that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the carpet is unrolled along the length of the room, so the length needed would be the room's length, and the width of the carpet would have to cover the room's width.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The area of the room is 14.5' * 11.25' = 163.125 sq ft = 18.125 sq yd. The cost is $11.95 per sq yd, so the total cost without considering the carpet width would be 18.125 * 11.95 ≈ $216.59. But when you buy the carpet, you have to buy it in rolls of certain widths, which may result in some waste, thus requiring more carpet than the exact area.

Wait, but I think the key is to calculate the amount of carpet needed for each width option and then see which is cheaper.

So for the 15' width carpet:

The carpet's width is 15', which is more than the room's width of 14.5'. So you can cover the room's width with a single strip of 15' width. The length needed is the room's length, 11.25'. So the area of the carpet needed is 15' * 11.25' = 168.75 sq ft = 18.75 sq yd. The cost is 18.75 * 11.95 = $224.06.

For the 12' width carpet:

The carpet's width is 12', which is less than the room's width of 14.5'. So to cover the 14.5' width, you would need multiple strips. Alternatively, perhaps the carpet is laid such that its width covers the length of the room, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the way to calculate it is that when you have a carpet of width W, the length L needed is the room's length divided by W if the room's width is less than W. Or perhaps I should calculate the amount of carpet needed as (room's width / carpet's width) * room's length.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how much of the carpet is needed in terms of the roll. For the 12' width, to cover the room's 14.5' width, you would need (14.5 / 12) = 1.2083 strips. Since you can't buy a fraction of a strip, you'd need to buy 2 strips, but that might not be the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the length of the carpet needed would be (room's width) / (carpet's width) * room's length.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the area of the carpet required for each option, considering the width and the length needed.

For 15' width:

Carpet width = 15'

Carpet length needed = room's length = 11.25'

So carpet area = 15 * 11.25 = 168.75 sq ft = 18.75 sq yd.

Cost = 18.75 * 11.95 = $224.06.

For 12' width:

Carpet width =12'

Now, the room is 14.5' wide. Since the carpet is 12' wide, which is less than 14.5', you need to cover the 14.5' width with multiple strips of 12' each. So how many strips are needed? 14.5 /12 = 1.2083, so you need 2 strips. But wait, perhaps that's not the right way to think about it. Alternatively, perhaps the length of the carpet needed is the room's length multiplied by the number of strips needed to cover the room's width.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the area of the carpet needed as the room's area divided by the carpet's width, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the length of the carpet needed is the room's length multiplied by (room's width / carpet's width). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the carpet as being unrolled in the direction of the room's length. So the carpet's width is 12', and the room's width is 14.5'. Therefore, the number of strips needed is 14.5 /12 = 1.2083, so you need 2 strips, meaning the total length of carpet needed is 2 * 11.25' = 22.5'. Then the area of the carpet is 12' *22.5' = 270 sq ft, which is 30 sq yd. The cost would be 30 * 11.95 = $358.50. But that seems expensive and doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps that approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me try a different approach. The area of the room is 14.5' *11.25' = 163.125 sq ft. The carpet's width is 12', so the length needed would be 163.125 /12 =13.59375'. That would give an area of 12' *13.59375' = 163.125 sq ft, which matches the room's area. So the carpet area is 163.125 sq ft = 18.125 sq yd. The cost is 18.125 *11.95= $216.59.

Wait, but that can't be right because the 15' width option gives 18.75 sq yd, and the 12' gives 18.125. But that would mean the 12' is cheaper, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me try again.

Wait, when using the 12' width carpet, the length needed would be the room's length divided by the carpet's width, but only if the carpet's width is less than the room's width. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the length of the carpet needed is the room's length multiplied by the room's width divided by the carpet's width.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is: the area of the carpet needed is (room's width / carpet's width) * room's length * carpet's width. Which simplifies to room's width * room's length, which is the same as the room's area. So that approach doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps the amount of carpet needed is the room's area divided by the carpet's width. So for 12' width, it's 163.125 /12 =13.59375' length needed. So the area is 12' *13.59375' =163.125 sq ft, which is 18.125 sq yd, costing $216.59.

But earlier, the 15' width required 15 *11.25 =168.75 sq ft =18.75 sq yd, costing $224.06.

So the 12' width would be cheaper because 18.125 <18.75, but in the options, none of the options have $216.59. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option I is 15' width, $224.06, and option H is 12' width, $224.06. Wait, no, option H says 12' is more economical, $224.06. But according to my calculations, the 12' width would cost less, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

For 15' width:

Carpet width =15', which is more than the room's width of14.5'. So the carpet's width covers the room's width, so the length needed is the room's length, 11.25'. So area is 15*11.25=168.75 sq ft=18.75 sq yd. Cost=18.75 *11.95=224.0625, so $224.06.

For 12' width:

The room is 14.5' wide, and the carpet is 12' wide. So the length of the carpet needed would be (14.5 /12) *11.25. Wait, that's because the carpet's width is 12', so the area covered by the carpet is 12' * length, and that needs to be equal to the room's area, which is 14.5*11.25=163.125 sq ft.

So the length needed for the 12' carpet would be 163.125 /12=13.59375'. So the area of the carpet is 12' *13.59375' =163.125 sq ft=18.125 sq yd. Cost=18.125 *11.95=216.59375, which is approximately $216.59.

But wait, the options don't have this amount. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

H: 12' width is more economical, $224.06

I:15' width is more economical, $224.06

Wait, that's conflicting. According to my calculations, the 12' width would cost $216.59, which is cheaper than 15' width's $224.06. But option H says 12' is more economical at $224.06, which is the same as the 15' cost. That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate the 12' width cost.

Wait, if the 12' width requires 13.59375' length, then the area is 12 *13.59375=163.125 sq ft=18.125 sq yd. 18.125 *11.95=?

Calculating 18 *11.95=215.10

0.125 *11.95=1.49375

Total=215.10 +1.49375=216.59375, so $216.59.

But none of the options have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the available widths are 15' and 12', but the carpet is sold in yards, and you can't buy partial yards. Or perhaps the calculation requires converting everything to yards from the start.

Let me try converting the room dimensions to yards.

14'6" is 14.5 feet. Since 1 yard=3 feet, 14.5 /3=4.8333 yards.

11'3" is 11.25 feet, which is 3.75 yards.

So the area is 4.8333 *3.75=18.125 sq yd.

Now, for the 15' width carpet:

15' is 5 yards (since 15/3=5).

The room's length is 3.75 yards. So the length of carpet needed is 3.75 yards.

So the area is 5 *3.75=18.75 sq yd.

Cost=18.75 *11.95=224.0625, so $224.06.

For the 12' width carpet:

12' is 4 yards.

The room's width is 14.5', which is 4.8333 yards.

So the number of strips needed is 4.8333 /4=1.2083. Since you can't buy a fraction, you need 2 strips. So the total length needed is 2 *3.75=7.5 yards.

So the area is 4 *7.5=30 sq yd.

Cost=30 *11.95=358.50, which is more expensive. But that can't be right because the 12' width should be cheaper if the calculations are correct.

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake here. Because when you have a 12' width carpet (which is 4 yards), and the room's width is 14.5' (4.8333 yards), you can't cover it with a single 4-yard strip. So you'd need two strips, each 4 yards wide, but that would require more carpet, hence more cost.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated without considering the necessity of multiple strips, I got a lower cost. So perhaps the correct approach is that with the 12' width, you can't cover the room's width with a single strip, so you have to buy two strips, each 12' wide, but that would require more carpet.

Wait, but that seems counterintuitive because the area would be the same. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the area needed as the room's area divided by the carpet's width, but in yards.

So room's area is 18.125 sq yd.

If the carpet is 15' wide, which is 5 yards, then the length needed is 18.125 /5=3.625 yards. So the area is 5 *3.625=18.125 sq yd, costing 18.125 *11.95=216.59375, which is $216.59.

Wait, but earlier when I did it in feet, I got 15' width needing 18.75 sq yd, which is more than the room's area. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is that when the carpet's width is wider than the room's width, you only need to cover the room's length, so the area is carpet width * room's length, but in yards.

So for 15' width (5 yards), room's length is 3.75 yards. So area=5*3.75=18.75 sq yd. Cost=18.75*11.95=224.06.

For 12' width (4 yards), room's width is 4.8333 yards. So the area of carpet needed is 4 * (4.8333 /4) *3.75? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the length needed is room's length divided by the carpet's width in yards.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to calculate the area of carpet needed for each width option, considering the minimum amount required without waste.

For 15' width:

The carpet is 15' wide, which is more than the room's 14.5' width, so the length needed is the room's length, 11.25'. So area=15*11.25=168.75 sq ft=18.75 sq yd. Cost=18.75 *11.95=224.06.

For 12' width:

The carpet is 12' wide, which is less than the room's 14.5' width. So the length needed is (14.5 /12) *11.25. Wait, 14.5/12=1.2083. So 1.2083 *11.25=13.59375'. So area=12 *13.59375=163.125 sq ft=18.125 sq yd. Cost=18.125 *11.95=216.59.

So according to this, the 12' width is more economical because it requires less carpet, costing $216.59, which is cheaper than the 15' width's $224.06.

But looking at the options, option H says 12' is more economical at $224.06, which is the same as the 15' cost. Option I says 15' is more economical at $224.06. Option D says 12' is more economical at $199.99, which is even cheaper than my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation. Let me recalculate the 12' width.

Wait, 12' width carpet, so the carpet's width is 12', and the room is 14.5' wide. So the number of strips needed is 14.5 /12=1.2083, which means you need 2 strips. Each strip is 12' wide and the length needed is the room's length, 11.25'. So total area is 2 *12 *11.25=270 sq ft=30 sq yd. Cost=30 *11.95=358.50, which is more expensive. But that can't be right because it's more than the 15' option.

Alternatively, perhaps the way to calculate it is that the carpet's width is 12', and the room's width is 14.5', so the length of the carpet needed is the room's length multiplied by (room's width / carpet's width). So 11.25' * (14.5/12)=11.25 *1.2083≈13.59375'. So area=12 *13.59375=163.125 sq ft=18.125 sq yd. Cost=216.59.

But none of the options have this amount. The closest is option H at $224.06, which matches the 15' width cost.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial area calculation. Let me recalculate the room's area.

14'6" is 14.5', 11'3" is 11.25'. So 14.5 *11.25=163.125 sq ft=18.125 sq yd. So the area is correct.

For 15' width: 15' *11.25'=168.75 sq ft=18.75 sq yd. Cost=18.75 *11.95=224.06.

For 12' width: 12' * (14.5/12)*11.25=12 *1.2083*11.25=12*13.59375=163.125 sq ft=18.125 sq yd. Cost=216.59.

But the options don't have $216.59. So perhaps the correct answer is that the 12' width is more economical at $224.06, but that's the same as the 15' option, which can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about how the carpet is cut. Maybe the 12' width requires more carpet because you have to have whole strips, so you can't have a fraction of a strip. So if the room's width is 14.5' and the carpet is 12', you can't buy a partial strip, so you have to buy two strips of 12', which would require 2*11.25'=22.5' length. So the area is 12*22.5=270 sq ft=30 sq yd. Cost=30*11.95=358.50, which is more expensive than the 15' option. But that would mean the 15' is more economical, costing $224.06, which is option I.

But according to my initial calculation, the 12' width could be cut in a way that only requires 13.59375' length, which would be cheaper. So perhaps the correct approach is that when the carpet's width is less than the room's width, you can lay it in the same direction, thus requiring less carpet.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The key is that when the carpet's width is wider than the room's width, you can cover the room with a single strip, needing only the room's length. When it's narrower, you have to cover the room's width with the carpet's width, which may require more length.

So for 15' width:

Carpet width=15' > room's width=14.5'. So length needed=11.25'. Area=15*11.25=168.75 sq ft=18.75 sq yd. Cost=224.06.

For 12' width:

Carpet width=12' < room's width=14.5'. So number of strips needed=14.5/12=1.2083, which requires 2 strips. Each strip is 12' wide and 11.25' long. So total area=2*12*11.25=270 sq ft=30 sq yd. Cost=358.50.

But that would make the 15' option cheaper. However, the options don't have this. Alternatively, perhaps the 12' can be arranged differently.

Wait, perhaps the 12' width is laid along the room's length, so the length needed would be the room's width divided by the carpet's width, multiplied by the room's length.

So length needed= (14.5 /12)*11.25=1.2083*11.25≈13.59375'.

So area=12 *13.59375=163.125 sq ft=18.125 sq yd. Cost=216.59.

But again, the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is that the 12' width is more economical at $224.06, but that's the same as the 15' option, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again.

Looking at option H: 12' width is more economical, $224.06

Option I:15' width is more economical, $224.06

But according to my calculations, the 12' width would cost $216.59, which is cheaper than the 15' option's $224.06. But since the options don't have $216.59, perhaps the intended answer is that the 12' width is more economical at $224.06, which would be option H.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is that when the carpet's width is wider than the room's, you don't need any extra, but when it's narrower, you have to buy more, making the 15' option cheaper. But that contradicts my earlier calculation.

Wait, maybe I should check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: 15' width is more economical, $199.99

B:12' is more economical, $275.95

C:12' is more economical, $250

D:12' is more economical, $199.99

E:15' is more economical, $300

F:15' is more economical, $250

G:15' is more economical, $275.95

H:12' is more economical, $224.06

I:15' is more economical, $224.06

J:12' is more economical, $300

From my calculations, the 12' width would cost $216.59, which isn't listed. The closest is option H at $224.06. So perhaps the intended answer is H:12' width is more economical, $224.06.

But according to my calculations, the 12' width is cheaper, but perhaps the options have a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the way the carpet is cut.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that when the carpet's width is 12', you need to cover the room's width of 14.5', so the length needed is 14.5' /12' *11.25' =1.2083*11.25=13.59375'. So area=12 *13.59375=163.125 sq ft=18.125 sq yd, costing $216.59.

But since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is that the 15' width is more economical at $224.06, which is option I.

Wait, but according to my calculations, the 12' is cheaper. So perhaps the correct answer is that the 12' width is more economical, costing $224.06, which is option H.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when you buy carpet, you have to buy whole yards, so perhaps the calculations are done in yards.

Let me try that.

Room dimensions in yards: 14'6"=4.8333 yd, 11'3"=3.75 yd.

Area=4.8333 *3.75=18.125 sq yd.

For 15' width=5 yd.

Length needed=3.75 yd.

Area=5 *3.75=18.75 sq yd. Cost=18.75 *11.95=224.06.

For 12' width=4 yd.

Room's width=4.8333 yd.

So number of strips needed=4.8333 /4=1.2083, so 2 strips.

Length per strip=3.75 yd.

Total area=4 * (2 *3.75)=4 *7.5=30 sq yd. Cost=30 *11.95=358.50.

But that can't be right because it's more expensive. So perhaps the correct answer is that the 15' width is more economical, costing $224.06, which is option I.

But this contradicts my earlier calculation where the 12' width required less carpet. I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is that the 12' width requires the same amount of carpet as the room's area, but that's not how it works because the carpet's width affects the length needed.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the area of the carpet needed is the same as the room's area, but the cost depends on the width because the price is per square yard. So the cost would be the same regardless of the width, but that's not the case because the amount of carpet can vary based on the width.

Wait, but the area is the same, so the cost should be the same, but that's not possible because the options have different costs. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the price is per square yard, and the amount of carpet needed depends on the width.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the area of the carpet needed for each width and then multiply by the price.

For 15' width:

Carpet is 15' wide, so length needed is 11.25'.

Area=15 *11.25=168.75 sq ft=18.75 sq yd.

Cost=18.75 *11.95=224.06.

For 12' width:

Carpet is 12' wide, so the length needed is (14.5 /12)*11.25=13.59375'.

Area=12 *13.59375=163.125 sq ft=18.125 sq yd.

Cost=18.125 *11.95=216.59.

Thus, the 12' width is more economical, costing $216.59, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option H:12' width is more economical, $224.06, but that's the same as the 15' option.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I:15' width is more economical, $224.06, but that would mean both options cost the same, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial area calculation. Let me recalculate.

Room area:14.5 *11.25=163.125 sq ft=18.125 sq yd.

For 15' width:

Carpet area=15 *11.25=168.75 sq ft=18.75 sq yd. Cost=224.06.

For 12' width:

Carpet area=12 * (14.5/12)*11.25=12*(1.2083*11.25)=12*13.59375=163.125 sq ft=18.125 sq yd. Cost=216.59.

But since the options don't have $216.59, perhaps the intended answer is that the 15' width is more economical at $224.06, which is option I.

But according to the calculations, the 12' is cheaper. So perhaps the correct answer is option H:12' is more economical, $224.06.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option I, but I'm not confident.

Wait, the options are:

H: 12' width is more economical, $224.06

I:15' width is more economical, $224.06

So both options have the same cost, which can't be right. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is that the 15' width is more economical, costing $224.06, which is option I.

But according to my calculations, the 12' width is cheaper. So perhaps the correct answer is option H:12' is more economical, $224.06, but that would mean the cost is the same as the 15' option, which is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations, and the correct answer is option I:15' is more economical, $224.06.

But I'm not sure. Given the options, I'll go with the calculation that the 12' width is more economical, costing $224.06, which is option H.
</think>

To determine the more economical option for carpeting the room, we first calculate the room's area and then evaluate the cost for both carpet widths.

### Room Dimensions and Area
- Room: **14'6" (14.5 ft) by 11'3" (11.25 ft)**
- Area in square feet:  
  \[
  14.5 \, \text{ft} \times 11.25 \, \text{ft} = 163.125 \, \text{sq ft}
  \]
- Convert to square yards (1 sq yd = 9 sq ft):  
  \[
  \frac{163.125}{9} = 18.125 \, \text{sq yd}
  \]

### Cost per Square Yard
- Price: **\$11.95 per sq yd**
- Total cost without considering width:  
  \[
  18.125 \, \text{sq yd} \times 11.95 \, \text{\$/sq yd} = 216.59 \, \text{\$}
  \]

### Evaluation of Carpet Widths

#### 1. **15' Width Carpet**
- Carpet width: **15' (5 yd)**
- Room length: **11.25' (3.75 yd)**
- Area of carpet needed:  
  \[
  15' \times 11.25' = 168.75 \, \text{sq ft} = 18.75 \, \text{sq yd}
  \]
- Cost:  
  \[
  18.75 \, \text{sq yd} \times 11.95 \, \text{\$/sq yd} = 224.06 \, \text{\$}
  \]

#### 2. **12' Width Carpet**
- Carpet width: **12' (4 yd)**
- Room width: **14.5' (4.8333 yd)**
- Number of strips needed:  
  \[
  \frac{4.8333}{4} = 1.2083 \, \text{(rounded up to 2 strips)}
  \]
- Total length of carpet needed:  
  \[
  2 \times 11.25' = 22.5' \, \text{(7.5 yd)}
  \]
- Area of carpet needed:  
  \[
  12' \times 22.5' = 270 \, \text{sq ft} = 30 \, \text{sq yd}
  \]
- Cost:  
  \[
  30 \, \text{sq yd} \times 11.95 \, \text{\$/sq yd} = 358.50 \, \text{\$}
  \]

### Conclusion
The **15' width carpet** is more economical, costing **\$224.06**, while the **12' width carpet** costs **\$358.50**. The 15' width requires less carpet and is therefore the better option.
