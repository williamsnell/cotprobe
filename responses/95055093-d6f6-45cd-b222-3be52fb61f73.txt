Alright, so I've got this question about the Articles of Confederation and their weaknesses. Hmm, I remember that the Articles were the first system of government for the United States after declaring independence, right? They had a lot of problems which eventually led to the need for the Constitution. 

The question is asking about a major weakness. The passage provided talks about the difficulty of combining various sentiments and interests of a continent divided into many sovereign states. It also mentions the necessity of uniting all councils and strength to defend their liberties. So, the issue here seems to be about unity and the effectiveness of the government under the Articles.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Made it too difficult to raise money through taxes and duties. I think the Articles did have a problem with funding because they couldn't tax the states directly. They had to ask the states for money, which often wasn't enough. So this seems like a possible answer.

Option B: Did not include a provision for creating new states. I'm not too sure about this. I think the Articles allowed for new states to join, but maybe the process was cumbersome. But I'm not certain if this was a major weakness compared to other issues.

Option C: Created a too-powerful chief executive. Wait, under the Articles, there wasn't even a president. The government was run by a Congress without an executive branch. So this option doesn't seem right because the Articles actually lacked a strong executive, not the opposite.

Option D: Established a single national identity too quickly. I don't think that's correct. The Articles were more about states being independent, so maybe they didn't establish a strong national identity, which could be a weakness, but I'm not sure if this is the main point.

Option E: Denied the federal government the power to mediate disputes between states. Yes, that's a key issue. The Articles couldn't interfere in state affairs, so if states had disputes, there was no federal authority to mediate. That would definitely be a weakness.

Option F: Granted too much power to the judicial branch. The Articles didn't really set up a strong judicial system. The Supreme Court was established under the Constitution, not the Articles. So this option doesn't seem right.

Option G: Failed to establish a national currency. That's true; the Articles didn't create a unified currency, leading to economic issues. But was this the major weakness? Maybe, but I think the lack of a strong central government was more critical.

Option H: Did not include a mechanism for their own amendment. Oh, right! The Articles required unanimous consent from all states to be amended, which was practically impossible. That's a huge weakness because it prevented the system from adapting.

Option I: Did not provide for a national army or navy. The Articles did allow for the Continental Congress to declare war and raise military forces, but funding and control were issues. However, the states could contribute troops, but without a strong central authority, it was hard to manage. So this is a possible weakness.

Option J: Allowed unrestricted movement of goods and people. Wait, the Articles actually imposed tariffs and trade restrictions between states, so this option seems incorrect. They didn't allow free movement; they had trade barriers.

Now, considering the passage, it mentions the difficulty of combining sentiments and interests because of many sovereign states. So the problem was that the states were too independent, making it hard to act as a unified nation. That points towards weaknesses related to the lack of a strong central government.

Looking back, the major weaknesses included the inability to regulate commerce effectively, no executive branch, a weak judiciary, and the inability to amend the Articles easily. The question is about a major weakness.

Option A: Taxation issues. The Articles couldn't levy taxes directly, so raising money was tough. That's a significant weakness.

Option E: No power to mediate disputes. That's another weakness because states could end up in conflicts without resolution.

Option H: No amendment process. That's a huge flaw because it made the system inflexible.

Option I: No national army/navy. Without a strong military, the nation was vulnerable.

The question is asking for the major weakness. The passage emphasizes the difficulty of combining sentiments and the need for unity. So the key issue was that the Articles couldn't create a strong enough central government to effectively manage the states. 

I think the most significant weakness was the lack of an effective way to amend the Articles, as it was nearly impossible. That made the system rigid and unable to adapt, which was a major problem leading to the push for the Constitution. So the correct answer would be H: did not include a mechanism for their own amendment.

The major weakness of the Articles of Confederation, as highlighted in the passage, was their inability to create a strong central government that could effectively manage the independent states. Among the options, the lack of a mechanism for amendment (Option H) stands out as a critical flaw because it made the system inflexible and unable to adapt to changing circumstances, ultimately leading to the need for the Constitution. 

Answer: H
