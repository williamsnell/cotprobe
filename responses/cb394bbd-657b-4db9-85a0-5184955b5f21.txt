Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about evaluating two surface integrals over a sphere. The vector field F is given as F = k r^n r̂, where r̂ is the radial unit vector. The sphere has radius a and is centered at the origin.

So, the problem asks for two integrals: the flux integral ∫∫_S F · n̂ ds and the circulation integral (or maybe curl flux?) ∫∫_S F × n̂ ds. I need to calculate both and match the answer to the options given.

First, let's recall what these integrals represent. The first one, F · n̂ ds, is the flux of F through the surface S. The second, F × n̂ ds, might be the flux of the curl of F through S, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it could be the circulation if it's a line integral, but since it's a surface integral, it's more likely the flux of the curl.

Wait, no. Wait, F × n̂ is a vector. So, the integral ∫∫ F × n̂ ds would actually be the surface integral of F crossed with the normal vector. Hmm. Alternatively, I might be confusing this with Stokes' theorem, which relates a line integral around a closed curve to the flux of the curl through the surface bounded by that curve. But here, the question is about a surface integral involving F × n̂. Wait, perhaps I should think about it differently. Maybe it's the flux of the curl of F through S. Because the integral of (curl F) · n̂ ds is equal to the line integral of F around the boundary of S, but in this case, S is a closed surface, so the boundary is a loop, but a sphere doesn't have a boundary unless it's like a surface with a hole. Wait, but a sphere is a closed surface, so perhaps the boundary is zero? Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it.

Let me approach each integral one by one.

Starting with the first integral: ∫∫_S F · n̂ ds. Since S is a sphere, the outward normal vector n̂ is just r̂. So, F · n̂ = (k r^n r̂) · r̂ = k r^n. But wait, on the sphere of radius a, r is equal to a. So, F · n̂ = k a^n.

Therefore, the flux integral becomes ∫∫_S F · n̂ ds = ∫∫_S k a^n ds. Since k a^n is a constant, it can be pulled out of the integral: k a^n ∫∫_S ds.

But ∫∫_S ds is just the surface area of the sphere. The surface area of a sphere is 4πa². So, the integral becomes k a^n * 4π a² = 4π k a^{n+2}.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 4π k a^{n+2} as an option. Let me check the options again.

Check the options:

Option A: 2π k a^{n+3}, -1

Option B: 4πk a^{n+2}, 0

Option C: 2πk a^{n+2}, 0

Option D: 6πk a^{n+2}, π

Option E:3πk a^{n+1}, π a^n

Option F:4πk a^{n+3},1

Option G:4πk a^{n},0

Option H:4πk a^{n-1},0

Option I:2πk a^{n},2π a^n

Option J:4πk a^{n+1},0

Hmm. So, the first part I calculated is 4πk a^{n+2}, which matches option B's first part (4πk a^{n+2}) and option C's first part is 2πk a^{n+2}, which is half of what I got.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check. F · n̂ is correct as k a^n because r = a on the sphere. Then, the integral over the sphere's surface area is 4πa², so the flux is k a^n * 4π a² = 4π k a^{n+2}. So, yes, that's correct.

So, looking at the options, option B's first term is 4πk a^{n+2}, which matches, and the second term is 0. So, perhaps the second integral is zero.

Now, moving on to the second integral: ∫∫_S F × n̂ ds.

Wait, but F × n̂ is a vector. The integral is a vector integral. Let's compute it.

First, let's compute F × n̂. Since n̂ is r̂, and F is along r̂, so F = k r^n r̂.

So, F × n̂ = (k r^n r̂) × r̂. The cross product of r̂ with itself is zero because any vector crossed with itself is zero. So, F × n̂ = 0.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if F is along r̂, then F × n̂ (which is r̂) would be r̂ × r̂, which is zero. So, the integrand is zero, so the integral ∫∫_S F × n̂ ds is zero.

So, both integrals are 4π k a^{n+2} and 0. So, the first integral is 4πk a^{n+2}, and the second is 0.

Looking at the options, option B is (4πk a^{n+2}, 0), which matches.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I make a mistake in the second integral? Because sometimes you can have a surface integral involving the curl. But in this case, the problem is F × n̂, not (curl F) · n̂. So, perhaps I should think about it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the second integral is the flux of the curl of F through the surface. Because according to Stokes' theorem, the flux of the curl of F through the surface S is equal to the circulation of F around the boundary of S. But wait, S is a closed surface, so the boundary would be a loop enclosing the volume inside. But in this case, the sphere is a closed surface, so the boundary is a loop (like a great circle) around it. However, the sphere itself doesn't have a boundary unless we're considering a surface with a hole. But in this case, it's a solid sphere, so perhaps the flux of the curl is zero? Or maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. Stokes' theorem says that the line integral of F around a closed curve C is equal to the flux of curl F through any surface bounded by C. But in this problem, the surface S is a sphere, which is a closed surface, so perhaps the boundary is a loop that goes around the "equator" of the sphere. But the sphere itself is a closed surface, so perhaps the flux of the curl through the sphere is zero because the sphere has no boundary other than itself, which is a closed loop. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the curl of F and then compute its flux through the sphere.

So, F = k r^n r̂. Let's compute curl F.

In spherical coordinates, the curl of a vector field F with only the r-component (i.e., F = F_r r̂) is given by:

curl F = (1/(r sinθ)) [ ( ∂(F_φ sinθ)/∂θ - ∂F_ψ/∂φ ) r̂ - ... ].

Wait, but F only has an r-component, and F_φ = F_ψ = 0. So, the curl simplifies.

Wait, the general formula for curl F in spherical coordinates is:

curl F = (1/r²) [ ∂(r F_φ)/∂θ - ∂(F_θ)/∂φ ] r̂ 
         + (1/r² sinθ) [ ∂(F_r sinθ)/∂φ - ∂(r F_φ)/∂r ] θ̂ 
         + (1/r) [ ∂(r F_θ)/∂r - ∂(F_r)/∂θ ] ψ̂ 

But since F_φ = F_θ = 0, and F_r = k r^n, this simplifies to:

curl F = (1/r²) [ ∂(0)/∂θ - 0 ] r̂ 
         + (1/(r² sinθ)) [ ∂( (k r^n) sinθ )/∂φ - 0 ] θ̂ 
         + (1/r) [ ∂(0)/∂r - ∂(k r^n)/∂θ ] ψ̂ 

But F_φ and F_θ are zero, so the curl becomes:

curl F = 0 r̂ + (1/(r² sinθ)) [ ∂(k r^n sinθ)/∂φ ] θ̂ + 0 ψ̂ 

Now, ∂(k r^n sinθ)/∂φ is zero because there's no φ dependence in F. So the entire curl F is zero.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, F is radial, so its curl should be zero? Wait, wait, no. Wait, for a purely radial vector field F = F(r) r̂, the curl is indeed zero because the curl measures the rotation effect, and a radial field doesn't rotate anything.

So, curl F = 0. Therefore, the flux of curl F through the sphere is zero. So, ∫∫_S (curl F) · n̂ ds = 0.

But the problem is ∫∫_S F × n̂ ds. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Because F × n̂ is not the same as curl F · n̂. Let me clarify.

Wait, the second integral is ∫∫_S F × n̂ ds. Since n̂ is r̂, this becomes ∫∫_S F × r̂ ds. But F is along r̂, so F × r̂ is zero because the cross product of any vector with itself is zero. So, the integrand is zero, so the integral is zero.

So, the second integral is zero. Therefore, both integrals are 4πk a^{n+2} and 0. So, the answer should be option B.

The problem involves evaluating two surface integrals over a sphere of radius \( a \) centered at the origin for the vector field \( \mathbf{F} = k r^n \hat{r} \). 

### First Integral: Flux through the Sphere
The flux integral is given by:
\[
\iint_S \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{n}} \, dS
\]
On the sphere, the outward normal \( \mathbf{\hat{n}} \) is \( \hat{r} \), so:
\[
\mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{n}} = (k a^n \hat{r}) \cdot \hat{r} = k a^n
\]
The integral becomes:
\[
\iint_S k a^n \, dS = k a^n \iint_S dS = k a^n (4\pi a^2) = 4\pi k a^{n+2}
\]

### Second Integral: Circulation through the Sphere
The circulation integral is given by:
\[
\iint_S \mathbf{F} \times \mathbf{\hat{n}} \, dS
\]
Since \( \mathbf{\hat{n}} = \hat{r} \) and \( \mathbf{F} \) is along \( \hat{r} \), the cross product \( \mathbf{F} \times \hat{r} \) is zero because the cross product of any vector with itself is zero. Thus, the integrand is zero, and the integral evaluates to:
\[
\iint_S \mathbf{F} \times \mathbf{\hat{n}} \, dS = 0
\]

### Matching with Options
From the calculations, the flux is \( 4\pi k a^{n+2} \) and the circulation is \( 0 \). This matches **Option B**.
