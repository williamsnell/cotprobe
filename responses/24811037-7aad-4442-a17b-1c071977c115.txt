Okay, so I have this question about bonds and interest rates. Let me try to understand what it's asking. The bond sells for $1,000, and it pays an annual interest of $80. The monetary authorities expect the general price level to increase by 5% next year. I need to compute both the nominal and real interest rates.

Hmm, I remember that the nominal interest rate is the stated rate on the bond, which doesn't account for inflation. The real interest rate, on the other hand, is adjusted for inflation. So I think the formula for real interest rate is (nominal interest rate - inflation rate). But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I think there's a more precise formula using the Fisher equation.

The Fisher equation says that the nominal interest rate (i) is approximately equal to the real interest rate (r) plus the expected inflation rate (π). So, i ≈ r + π. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as (1 + i) = (1 + r)(1 + π). But since the numbers are probably small, maybe we can use the linear approximation.

Wait, but in this question, they give the nominal interest rate as a possible option, and we need to find both. Let me think. The bond's nominal interest rate is the annual interest paid divided by the face value. So, the bond pays $80 a year on a $1,000 bond. So the nominal interest rate is 80/1000, which is 8%. That makes sense because 80 divided by 1000 is 0.08, so 8%.

So the nominal interest rate is 8%. Now, the real interest rate would be the nominal rate minus the inflation rate. The inflation rate is 5%, so 8% - 5% equals 3%. Wait, no, that can't be right because sometimes it's the other way around. Or maybe I should use the Fisher equation properly.

Wait, let me get this straight. The Fisher equation is i = r + π + (r * π), but when the rates are small, the last term is negligible. So approximately, i ≈ r + π. So if I have i (nominal) and π (inflation), then r = i - π. So in this case, i is 8%, π is 5%, so r would be 3%.

So looking at the options, I need to find the one where the nominal is 8% and real is 3%. Let me check the options. Option G says nominal is 8%, real is 3%. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check. The bond's yield is 8% nominal. Inflation is 5%, so real interest is 3%. Yes, that matches option G.
</think>

The bond pays $80 annually on a $1,000 face value, yielding an 8% nominal interest rate. With a 5% inflation rate, the real interest rate is calculated as 8% - 5% = 3%. Option G matches these values.

Answer: G
