Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about finding the molarity of a sodium hydroxide solution. Hmm, I remember that molarity is moles per liter, right? So I need to figure out the number of moles of NaOH involved and then divide by the volume in liters.

The problem says that 42.6 mL of 0.108 M HCl is needed to neutralize 40.0 mL of the base, which is NaOH. Wait, neutralization reactions... I think the reaction between HCl and NaOH is a neutralization reaction where they form water and NaCl. The balanced equation should be HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H2O. So the mole ratio is 1:1, right?

So first, I'll calculate the moles of HCl used. The formula for moles is Molarity × Volume (in liters). So I'll convert 42.6 mL to liters by dividing by 1000. That gives 0.0426 L. Multiply that by 0.108 M: 0.0426 × 0.108. Let me calculate that. 0.0426 * 0.108 equals... let's see, 0.0046128 moles of HCl. Since the mole ratio is 1:1, that's the same number of moles of NaOH.

Now, I have to find the molarity of the NaOH solution. The formula is Molarity = moles / liters. The volume of NaOH is 40.0 mL, which is 0.0400 L. So putting it in: 0.0046128 moles divided by 0.0400 L. Let me do that division. 0.0046128 / 0.0400 is equal to 0.11532 M. Hmm, looking at the options, I see option I is 0.115 M, which is close to what I got. So I think that's the answer. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, did I convert mL to liters correctly? Yes, 42.6 mL is 0.0426 L and 40 mL is 0.0400 L. The moles calculation looks right, and the division gives roughly 0.115. Yes, looks correct. So the answer should be option I.

The reaction between HCl and NaOH is a 1:1 neutralization reaction. First, calculate the moles of HCl:  
Moles of HCl = 0.108 M × 0.0426 L = 0.0046128 mol.  
Since the mole ratio is 1:1, moles of NaOH = 0.0046128 mol.  
Next, calculate the molarity of NaOH:  
Molarity = moles / volume (in liters) = 0.0046128 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.11532 M.  
The closest option is I: 0.115 M.
