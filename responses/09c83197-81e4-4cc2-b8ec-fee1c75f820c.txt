Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find all c in Z_3 such that Z_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2 + c) is a field. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that for the quotient ring Z_p[x]/(f(x)) to be a field, f(x) must be an irreducible polynomial over Z_p. Since Z_3 is the field here (because we're working modulo 3), p is 3. So, the polynomial x^3 + x^2 + c needs to be irreducible over Z_3.

Irreducible means that the polynomial can't be factored into the product of two non-constant polynomials in Z_3[x]. So, I need to check for which values of c in Z_3, the polynomial doesn't factor into lower-degree polynomials.

Wait, but Z_3 has elements 0, 1, 2. So c can be 0, 1, or 2. I'll need to check each case.

Let me list the possible c values: 0,1,2. So the options given are A to J, but the possible c's are 0,1,2. Let me see the options again:

Options are A: -2, B:2, C:1, D:-1, E:-3, F:0, G:3, H:4, I:6, J:5. So in Z_3, these options correspond to:

- A: -2 mod 3 is 1
- B:2 is 2
- C:1 is 1
- D:-1 mod3 is 2
- E: -3 mod3 is 0
- F:0 is 0
- G:3 mod3 is 0
- H:4 mod3 is1
- I:6 mod3 is0
- J:5 mod3 is2

So the possible c values in Z_3 are 0,1,2, which correspond to options F, C, E, I, H, D, J, B, etc. Wait, but the question asks to select all c in Z_3, so the possible c's are 0,1,2.

Now, the task is to find for which c the polynomial x³ +x² +c is irreducible over Z_3. If it's irreducible, then the quotient ring is a field.

So for each c in {0,1,2}, check if x³ +x² +c is irreducible over Z_3.

Let's start with c=0: The polynomial is x³ + x². Let's factor this: x²(x + 1). So this factors into x² and (x+1), which are both non-constant. So the polynomial is reducible. Therefore, when c=0, the quotient ring is not a field.

Next, c=1: Polynomial is x³ +x² +1.

To check irreducibility, I think we can check if it has any roots in Z_3. If it doesn't, then it's irreducible because a cubic polynomial over a field can only factor into a linear times a quadratic, or three linears. If it has no roots, it can't have a linear factor, so it's irreducible.

Let me test the roots in Z_3: 0,1,2.

f(0) = 0 + 0 +1 =1 ≠0 mod3.

f(1)=1 +1 +1=3=0 mod3. Oh, so x=1 is a root. That means (x-1) is a factor. Wait, wait, but in Z_3, 1 is 1, so (x -1) is (x+2) because -1 ≡ 2 mod3.

Wait, but if the polynomial has a root, then it's reducible. So c=1 would give a reducible polynomial, so the quotient ring wouldn't be a field.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check: f(1) =1 +1 +1=3=0 mod3. So yes, 1 is a root. So the polynomial factors as (x-1)(something). That means it's reducible, so c=1 is not acceptable.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. For c=1, the polynomial is x³ +x² +1. Plugging in x=0: 0+0+1=1≠0. x=1: 1+1+1=3=0. So yes, x=1 is a root. So the polynomial factors as (x-1) times a quadratic. Therefore, it's reducible, so c=1 is out.

Now c=2: The polynomial is x³ +x² +2.

Again, let's check for roots in Z_3.

f(0)=0 +0 +2=2≠0.

f(1)=1 +1 +2=4=1≠0 mod3.

f(2)=8 +4 +2=14 mod3. 14 divided by 3 is 4 with remainder 2, so 14 mod3 is 2. So f(2)=2≠0.

So the polynomial has no roots in Z_3. Now, does that mean it's irreducible?

Well, for a cubic polynomial over a field, if it has no roots, it is irreducible because it can't have a linear factor, so it can't be factored into lower degree polynomials. So for c=2, the polynomial x³ +x² +2 is irreducible, so the quotient ring Z_3[x]/(x³ +x² +2) is a field.

Wait, but let me make sure. Another way to check is that if a cubic has no roots, it's irreducible. Yes, because any factorization would have to include a linear term, which would correspond to a root. Since there are no roots, it's irreducible.

So c=2 is acceptable.

Wait, but I should check if there are any other possible factorizations beyond linear factors. For example, could it factor into a product of a quadratic and a linear polynomial without having a root? No, because if it had such a factorization, the linear factor would imply a root. So if there are no roots, it's irreducible.

Therefore, the only c in Z_3 that makes the polynomial irreducible is c=2. So the correct answer is c=2.

Looking back at the options, option B is 2, which is in Z_3 as 2. So the correct answer is B:2.
</think>

The quotient ring Z_3[x]/(x³ + x² + c) is a field if and only if the polynomial x³ + x² + c is irreducible over Z_3. For c=0, the polynomial factors as x²(x+1), making it reducible. For c=1, it has a root at x=1, so it's reducible. For c=2, the polynomial has no roots and is irreducible. Thus, the only valid c is 2.

Answer: B
