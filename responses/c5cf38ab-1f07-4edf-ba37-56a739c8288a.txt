Okay, so I need to find the resistance of a nichromewire. Hmm, I remember that resistance depends on the material, length, and cross-sectional area. Oh right, the formula is R = resistivity * (length / area). 

Wait, nichrome is a specific type of wire, so I should know its resistivity. I think nichrome has a resistivity around 1.1 ohm-meters. Let me check my notes. Oh yeah, resistivity for nichrome is about 1.1 × 10^-6 ohm·meters, wait no, wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Oh wait, no, I think nichrome's resistivity is actually around 1.1 × 10^-6 ohm-meters. Wait, no, wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no, maybe it's higher. Let me think again. I remember that nichrome is used for heating elements because it has a high resistivity. Oh right, I think the resistivity is about 1.1 × 10^-6 ohm-meters. Wait, no, wait, that's 1.1e-6, which is 0.0000011 ohm·m. But wait, that seems low. Maybe I'm confusing with something else. Or perhaps it's 1.1 × 10^-4 ohm·m? Wait, no, I'm not sure. I think I should look it up, but since I can't, I'll proceed with what I think is correct.

Wait, another approach: I think the resistivity of nichrome is approximately 1.1 × 10^-6 ohm·m. Let me go with that for now.

The length of the wire is 225 centimeters, which is 2.25 meters. The cross-sectional area is 0.015 square centimeters. Oh wait, I need to convert that to square meters because the resistivity is in ohm·meters. So 1 square centimeter is (0.01 m)^2 = 0.0001 m². So 0.015 cm² is 0.015 * 0.0001 m² = 0.0000015 m², or 1.5e-6 m².

Now, plug into the formula: R = (resistivity) * (length / area). So R = (1.1e-6 ohm·m) * (2.25 m / 1.5e-6 m²).

Let me compute the division first: 2.25 / 1.5e-6. 2.25 divided by 1.5 is 1.5, and 1e-6 in the denominator is the same as multiplying by 1e6. So 1.5 * 1e6 = 1.5e6.

So R = 1.1e-6 * 1.5e6. Multiplying these gives (1.1 * 1.5) * (1e-6 * 1e6) = 1.65 * 1 = 1.65 ohms.

Wait, but none of the options is 1.65. Let me check the options again. The options are A:15, B:1.5, C:2.25, D:50, E:0.15, F:225, G:0.225, H:0.015, I:150, J:100.

Hmm, 1.65 is closest to option B:1.5. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the resistivity value. Alternatively, perhaps the resistivity is higher.

Wait, I think I might have mixed up the exponent. Let me double-check. If the resistivity is 1.1 × 10^-4 ohm·m, then let's recalculate.

If resistivity is 1.1e-4 ohm·m, then:

R = (1.1e-4) * (2.25 / 1.5e-6) 

First, 2.25 / 1.5e-6 = (2.25 / 1.5) * 1e6 = 1.5e6.

So R = 1.1e-4 * 1.5e6 = (1.1 * 1.5) * (1e-4 * 1e6) = 1.65 * 100 = 165 ohms.

That's not matching either. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I have the resistivity wrong. Let me think again. Maybe the correct resistivity for nichrome is around 1.1 × 10^-6 ohm·m. Because nichrome is used for high-temperature resistors, so higher resistance, but maybe that's not directly related.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the formula correctly. Let me recheck the calculations.

Length L = 225 cm = 2.25 meters.

Area A = 0.015 cm² = 0.015 * (1e-4 m²) = 1.5e-6 m².

Resistivity rho = 1.1e-6 ohm·m (assuming that's correct).

So R = rho * L / A = (1.1e-6) * (2.25) / (1.5e-6).

Compute denominator first: 1.5e-6.

So 2.25 / 1.5e-6 = (2.25 / 1.5) * 1e6 = 1.5 * 1e6 = 1.5e6.

Then R = 1.1e-6 * 1.5e6 = (1.1 * 1.5) * (1e-6 * 1e6) = 1.65 * 1 = 1.65 ohms.

Hmm, but the options don't have 1.65. The closest is B:1.5. Alternatively, perhaps the resistivity is 1.0 × 10^-6 ohm·m. Let's try that.

R = (1.0e-6) * (2.25 / 1.5e-6) = 1.0e-6 * 1.5e6 = 1.5 ohms. Oh, that matches option B.

So perhaps the resistivity is 1.0e-6 ohm·m. Maybe I was mixing up the resistivity value. So the correct answer would be 1.5 ohms, which is option B.

The resistance of the nichromewire can be calculated using the formula \( R = \rho \cdot \frac{L}{A} \), where \( \rho \) is the resistivity of nichrome, \( L \) is the length, and \( A \) is the cross-sectional area. Given the length \( L = 225 \, \text{cm} = 2.25 \, \text{m} \) and the area \( A = 0.015 \, \text{cm}^2 = 1.5 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^2 \), and assuming the resistivity \( \rho \) of nichrome is approximately \( 1.0 \times 10^{-6} \, \Omega \cdot \text{m} \), the calculation yields \( R = 1.5 \, \Omega \). This matches option B.
