Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with all the units and conversions, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: A 50 g bullet traveling at 40,000 cm/sec is stopped by a steel plate. We need to find out how much heat is generated, assuming all the energy is converted into heat. The options are given in ergs, so I think I need to calculate the kinetic energy of the bullet and then convert that into heat.

First, I remember that kinetic energy (KE) is calculated using the formula KE = ½ mv², where m is mass and v is velocity. But wait, the units here are grams and centimeters per second, so I need to make sure I convert them correctly to standard units if necessary, but since the answer is in ergs, which is the cgs unit for energy, maybe I can work directly in those units.

Let me write down the given values:
- Mass (m) = 50 grams. Hmm, I think in physics, mass is usually in kilograms, but since the answer is in ergs, which uses grams, I can keep it as 50 g.
- Velocity (v) = 40,000 cm/s. Again, since we're using cgs units, this should be fine.

So, plugging into the formula:
KE = ½ * m * v²
= 0.5 * 50 g * (40,000 cm/s)²

Wait, I should calculate that step by step. Let's break it down.

First, calculate the velocity squared: (40,000 cm/s)^2. That's 40,000 multiplied by 40,000. Let me compute that. 40,000 is 4e4, so (4e4)^2 is 16e8, which is 1.6e9 cm²/s².

Wait, no, 40,000 is 4 * 10^4, so squared is (4)^2 * (10^4)^2 = 16 * 10^8 = 1.6e9 cm²/s².

So, v² = (4e4)^2 = 1.6e9 cm²/s².

Now, mass is 50 grams, so m = 50 g.

So, KE = 0.5 * 50g * 1.6e9 cm²/s².

Calculating that:

0.5 * 50 = 25. So 25 * 1.6e9 = 4e10 ergs? Wait, because 1 erg is 1 g cm²/s². So, the units would be in ergs, which is correct.

Wait, let me do the math again. 25 * 1.6e9 = ?

25 * 1.6 is 40, so 40e9, which is 4e10 ergs.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is 4 × 10^10 ergs. That's one of the choices. So I'm thinking that's the answer. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, 40,000 cm/s is 4e4 cm/s. Squared is (4e4)^2 = 16e8 = 1.6e9 cm²/s². Correct.

Mass is 50 g, so 0.5 * 50 = 25. Then 25 * 1.6e9 = 40e9, which is 4e10. So yeah, 4e10 ergs. That's option F.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I miss any unit conversions? Because sometimes when dealing with different units, like if the velocity was in meters per second, I'd have to convert it to centimeters. But in this case, the velocity is already in cm/s, so no conversion needed. Mass is in grams, which is correct for ergs. So the calculation should be correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider if the bullet's kinetic energy is entirely converted into heat. The question states that, so yes, all the kinetic energy becomes heat, so the heat generated is equal to the kinetic energy.

So, the answer should be F: 4 × 10^10 ergs.

The kinetic energy of the bullet is calculated using the formula \( KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \). With \( m = 50 \, \text{g} \) and \( v = 40,000 \, \text{cm/s} \), the velocity squared is \( (40,000)^2 = 1.6 \times 10^9 \, \text{cm}^2/\text{s}^2 \). Substituting into the formula gives \( KE = 0.5 \times 50 \times 1.6 \times 10^9 = 4 \times 10^{10} \, \text{ergs} \). Since all energy is converted to heat, the answer is F.
