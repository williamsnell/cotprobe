Alright, let's tackle this impeachment question. So, the question is asking which statement is not true about impeachment. The options are A through D. 

First, I remember that impeachment is a process outlined in the U.S. Constitution, specifically in Articles I, II, and III. It's a way to remove federal officials for serious misconduct. The president, vice-president, and civil officers are subject to impeachment.

Looking at the options, let's break them down one by one.

Option A: Grounds include high crimes and misdemeanors. I think this is correct because the term "high crimes and misdemeanors" is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution as grounds for impeachment. So A is true, making it not the correct answer.

Option B: A majority vote in the House is necessary to invoke charges of impeachment. From what I recall, the House of Representatives can impeach by a simple majority vote. So yes, B is true, so it's not the answer.

Option C: Grounds include treason and bribery. Treason and bribery are definitely listed in the Constitution as impeachable offenses. So C is true, not the answer.

Option D: A three-fourths vote in the Senate is necessary to convict and remove from office. Wait, I thought the Senate requires a two-thirds majority to convict. I remember that during the impeachment trials, the threshold is high. For example, in the case of Andrew Johnson, the vote was very close, but it was two-thirds needed. So D says three-fourths, which is higher than what's actually required. Therefore, D is not true, making it the correct answer.

The statement that is not true is D because a three-fourths vote is not required; instead, a two-thirds majority is needed in the Senate to convict and remove an official during an impeachment trial.

Answer: D
