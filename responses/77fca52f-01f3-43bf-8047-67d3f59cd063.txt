Question:

Large deficits of water can be only partly compensated for by renal conservation; drinking is the ultimate compensatory mechanism. What stimulates the subjective feeling of thirst which drives one to drink water?

Options:

A: Decreased blood sodium levels
B: Low plasma osmolarity
C: Low body temperature
D: High blood pressure
E: Low levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH)
F: A high intracellular fluid volume
G: A low extracellular fluid volume and a high plasma osmolarity
H: High extracellular fluid volume
I: Increased saliva production
J: High glucose levels in the blood

Answer:

Okay, so I have this question about the body's response to water deficits and what causes the feeling of thirst. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that large water deficits can't be fully compensated by the kidneys, so drinking is the main way to make up for it. So, the focus is on what makes us feel thirsty and go drink water.

I remember that thirst is a response to the body's need for water. It's regulated by osmoreceptors in the brain, right? Osmoreceptors detect changes in the osmolarity of the blood. Osmolarity is the concentration of solutes in the blood. When the osmolarity increases, that means the blood is more concentrated, so the body needs more water.

Looking at the options, the key thing is to find what condition triggers the feeling of thirst. So, let's go through each option:

A: Decreased blood sodium levels. Lower sodium would lower osmolarity, so probably wouldn't trigger thirst. Thirst is usually when the body is dehydrated, which makes osmolarity higher.

B: Low plasma osmolarity. Low osmolarity means the blood is less concentrated. If osmolarity is low, the body is probably well-hydrated, so why would you feel thirsty? So this might not be the answer.

C: Low body temperature. I'm not sure how temperature directly affects thirst. Maybe through sweating, but the question is about the immediate trigger, which I think is more about osmolarity.

D: High blood pressure. High blood pressure might make the kidneys work harder, but I don't recall it directly causing thirst. Unless the body is trying to excrete more water, but that's not the main driver.

E: Low levels of ADH. ADH (antidiuretic hormone) causes the kidneys to retain water. If ADH is low, the kidneys would excrete more water, leading to dehydration. But does low ADH cause thirst? I think ADH is released in response to high osmolarity, so low ADH might be a result, not the cause of thirst.

F: High intracellular fluid volume. High intracellular volume means the cells are holding a lot of fluid. But I think the osmotic sensors are more focused on the extracellular fluid, particularly the plasma. So maybe not this one.

G: Low extracellular fluid volume and high plasma osmolarity. Low extracellular fluid volume would mean dehydration, and high osmolarity would mean the blood is concentrated. Both of these conditions would signal the body to conserve water and trigger thirst. This sounds right.

H: High extracellular fluid volume. If the volume is high, the body is probably hydrated, so thirst wouldn't be triggered. So this is the opposite of what we need.

I: Increased saliva production. I'm not sure how this relates. Maybe when you're dehydrated, you don't produce much saliva, but increased production would suggest the body is okay with water, so not the trigger.

J: High glucose levels. High glucose can cause thirst because of osmotic effects, but the question is about water deficits in general. While high glucose does contribute to thirst, the primary trigger is osmolarity from water loss, not just glucose.

So putting it all together, the feeling of thirst is mainly triggered when the body detects low extracellular fluid volume and high plasma osmolarity. That's option G.
</think>

The subjective feeling of thirst is primarily triggered by the body's detection of low extracellular fluid volume and high plasma osmolarity, which indicates a need for water. This condition signals the brain to initiate the drive to drink water, compensating for the deficit that cannot be fully addressed by renal mechanisms.

Answer: G
