Okay, so I've got this question about Mr. Donald's investment returns. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, I need to understand what exactly the question is asking. It says he received dividends of $48, $64, $82.50, and $90. His total investment was $12,450, and we need to find the rate of return for the year, rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent.

Hmm, rate of return on investment, right? I remember that the rate of return is usually calculated by taking the total return (which in this case is the total dividends received) divided by the total investment, then multiplied by 100 to get a percentage.

So, first, I need to add up all the dividends he received. Let's list them out: $48, $64, $82.50, and $90. I'll add them one by one.

Starting with $48 and $64. Adding those gives me $112. Then, I'll add $82.50 to that. So, $112 plus $82.50 equals $194.50. Next, adding the last dividend of $90. So, $194.50 plus $90 brings the total to $284.50. Okay, so the total dividends for the year are $284.50.

Now, his total investment was $12,450. So, the rate of return (ROR) would be (Total Dividends / Total Investment) * 100. Plugging in the numbers, that's ($284.50 / $12,450) * 100.

Let me calculate that. First, I'll do the division: 284.50 divided by 12,450. Let me get my calculator for that. 284.5 divided by 12,450 equals approximately 0.022857. Now, multiplying that by 100 to get the percentage: 0.022857 * 100 = 2.2857%.

The question asks for the nearest tenth of a percent, so we look at the hundredth place. The number is 2.2857%. The hundredth digit is 8, which is more than 5, so we round up the tenth place from 2 to 3. Wait, no, wait a second. Let me double-check that. Wait, 0.022857 is 2.2857%. So, the tenth place is 2, the hundredth is 8. Since 8 is greater than 5, we round the 2 up to 3. So, the rate of return would be approximately 2.3%.

Wait, but let me make sure I did the division correctly. Maybe I should calculate it more precisely. Let me write it out:

Dividing 284.5 by 12,450:
- 12,450 goes into 284.5 how many times?
Well, 12,450 x 0.02 is 249. So, 249 is less than 284.5. The difference is 35.5.
Then, 12,450 x 0.002 is 24.9. So, 249 + 24.9 = 273.9. That's still less than 284.5. The difference is 10.6.
Next, 12,450 x 0.0008 is approximately 9.96. Adding that to 273.9 gives 283.86. Now, the difference is about 0.64. So, 0.0008 + 0.00005 (since 12,450 x 0.00005 is about 0.6225) would give us approximately 0.00085. So, adding that, we get about 0.02285, which is 2.285%.

So, 2.285%, which rounds to 2.3% when rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent.

Looking back at the options, option G is 2.3%, so that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me check again. Did I add the dividends correctly? Let me add them again:

$48 + $64 is $112. Then, $112 + $82.50 is $194.50. Then, $194.50 + $90 is $284.50. Yes, that's correct.

And the total investment is $12,450. So, 284.50 / 12450 = 0.022857, which is 2.2857%, so 2.3% when rounded. So, the answer should be G: 2.3%.

The rate of return is calculated by dividing the total dividends ($284.50) by the total investment ($12,450), then multiplying by 100. This results in approximately 2.3%.
