Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together. We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance."
Mao Zedong, On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation, 1955

Okay, so I've got this question about Mao Zedong's views on agricultural cooperation and which ideals they reflect. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the question is asking which of the given options most directly influenced Mao's view on the cooperation of peasant labor. The passage is from Mao's 1955 essay, "On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation." In it, he talks about the growing capitalist tendencies in the countryside, the polarization between rich and poor peasants, and the need for socialist transformation through cooperation to eliminate individual economies and the rich-peasant class.

I remember that Mao was a big proponent of collectivization and the idea that agricultural cooperation would lead to a more equitable society. He believed in the socialist transformation of agriculture, which would involve peasants working together in collectives to avoid class distinctions and economic disparities. This was part of his broader strategy to move towards a socialist society, which he saw as the only way to maintain the worker-peasant alliance and prevent the countryside from fragmenting.

Looking at the options:

A: Stalin's communism. Stalin's policies involved central planning, collectivization, and industrialization, which align with Mao's emphasis on collectivizing agriculture and moving towards socialism. So this seems relevant.

B: Salvador Allende's democratic socialism. Allende was more about a mixed economy, democratic processes, and reform within a capitalist framework. This doesn't seem to fit Mao's radical approach.

C: Bernie Sanders' social democracy. Sanders focuses on democratic processes and incremental reforms, which is quite different from Mao's revolutionary socialist approach.

D: Globalization through NAFTA or EU. This is about trade blocs and international trade, which doesn't seem related to Mao's focus on internal agricultural policies and collectivization.

E: Ayatollah Khomeini's religious fundamentalism. This is about religious governance, which Mao didn't align with since the Communist Party was atheist.

F: Milton Friedman's capitalist theory. Friedman was a proponent of free markets and capitalism, which is the opposite of what Mao was advocating for in the passage.

G: Adam Smith's classical liberalism. Smith was about free markets and minimal government intervention, again opposite to Mao's socialist policies.

H: Nationalism and populist movements. While Mao did emphasize nationalism, the question is about the cooperation of labor, which is more about economic policies than nationalism itself.

I: Enlightenment ideals like Robespierre's revolution. While the Enlightenment influenced many revolutions, Mao's socialism was more about collectivism and state control, not necessarily Enlightenment principles.

J: Fascism as per Mussolini. Fascism is about authoritarian nationalism and corporate capitalism, which doesn't align with Mao's socialist policies.

So, narrowing it down, the key here is Mao's focus on collectivization and socialist transformation. Stalin's communism, as in option A, heavily influenced Mao's policies. Stalin's push for collectivization in the Soviet Union was a model that Mao likely emulated, especially given the emphasis on eliminating individual economies and promoting collective farming to achieve socialism.

Therefore, the most direct influence on Mao's view is Stalin's communist ideals.

The passage reflects Mao's emphasis on collectivization and socialist transformation, aligning closely with Stalin's communist ideals of central planning and eliminating individual economies.
