Question:

Explain how the codon for phenylalanine was discovered.

Options:

A: The codon AUG, which also signals the start of protein synthesis, codes for phenylalanine
B: The triplet GGA was identified as the codon for phenylalanine through early genetic experiments
C: The codon CCC corresponds to phenylalanine
D: The codon UUU is the sequence of bases which causes phenylalanine to be placed in the polypeptide chain
E: Phenylalanine is coded by the codon GGG
F: The codon UUA was incorrectly thought to code for phenylalanine before further research clarified the correct codon
G: The codon AAG signals for the addition of phenylalanine to the polypeptide chain
H: The codon AGU was found to code for serine, but was initially believed to code for phenylalanine
I: The codon UUC was the first discovered sequence to code for phenylalanine
J: The codon AAA codes for phenylalanine

Alright, so I've got this question about how the codon for phenylalanine was discovered. I'm a bit rusty on my genetics, but let me try to think this through.

First, I remember that codons are the three-letter sequences in mRNA that correspond to amino acids. Each codon is made up of three nucleotides: A, U, C, or G. There are 64 possible codons, and most code for specific amino acids, with a few being stop signals.

Phenylalanine is one of the amino acids, and I think it's hydrophobic. I remember the genetic code chart from my studies. Let me try to recall which codons correspond to which amino acids. I think the standard codon for phenylalanine is UUU. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's UUC? Or was that something else?

Looking at the options, option D says UUU is the codon for phenylalanine. Option I says UUC is the first discovered. Hmm. I'm trying to remember the history of how the genetic code was deciphered. I recall that early experiments involved figuring out which RNA sequences corresponded to which amino acids. They used methods like mutation studies and eventually in vitro translation.

Wait, I think the first codon discovered was UUU for phenylalanine. Or was it another one? I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the early experiments. In the 1960s, Nirenberg and Matthaei did some groundbreaking work. They used polyribosomes and found that certain RNA sequences led to specific amino acids. For example, when they had mRNA with a lot of U's, they found phenylalanine was incorporated. So the triplet UUU would code for phenylalanine.

But looking at the options, option I says UUC was the first discovered. That doesn't sound right because UUC and UUU are both phenylalanine codons in the standard code. Wait, no, actually, in the standard code, UUU is Phe, and UUC is also Phe in some organisms or contexts? Or maybe I'm mixing up the codons.

Wait, no, in the standard genetic code, both UUU and UUC code for phenylalanine. So if option I says UUC was the first discovered, that might not be accurate because I think UUU was identified first as the codon for phenylalanine.

Looking back at the options, option D is UUU, which seems correct. But wait, option I is about UUC being the first. Maybe the initial experiments found UUU first. So the correct answer would be D: UUU.

Wait, but another thought: I remember that the first codon they discovered was UUU for phenylalanine. So option D is correct. But another option, option I, says UUC was the first. I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the first codon discovered was UUU. So the answer would be D. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me think again. Nirenberg and Matthaei used a synthetic mRNA with repeating U's, which would be UUUUUU..., and when translated, it produced a polyphenylalanine chain. So that suggests UUU is the codon. Therefore, option D is correct.

The codon for phenylalanine was discovered through experiments in the 1960s, where scientists used synthetic mRNA sequences to determine which triplets corresponded to specific amino acids. Nirenberg and Matthaei found that mRNA with repeating U's (UUUUUU...) led to the incorporation of phenylalanine, indicating that the codon UUU codes for phenylalanine. This discovery was pivotal in understanding the genetic code. 

Answer: D
