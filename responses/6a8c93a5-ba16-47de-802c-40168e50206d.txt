Okay, I need to find the minimum vertex cover of the given undirected graph G. The edges are E = {<2,1>, <2,0>, <2,3>, <1,4>, <4,3>}. So let me first visualize the graph to understand the connections better.

I'll start by listing all the nodes. From the edges, the nodes involved are 0,1,2,3,4. So the graph has 5 nodes.

Now, drawing the graph:

- Node 2 is connected to 1, 0, and 3.
- Node 1 is connected to 2 and 4.
- Node 4 is connected to 1 and 3.
- Node 3 is connected to 2 and 4.
- Node 0 is connected only to 2.

So the structure looks like this:

- 2 is a central node connected to 0,1,3.
- 1 is connected to 2 and 4.
- 4 is connected to 1 and 3.
- 3 is connected to 2 and 4.

Now, a vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The goal is to find the smallest such set.

I remember that the vertex cover problem is NP-hard, but for small graphs, I can approach it by checking possible combinations.

Let me list all edges:

Edges are: (2,1), (2,0), (2,3), (1,4), (4,3).

I need to cover all these edges.

The minimum vertex cover size for a graph can be found using Konig's theorem, which relates it to maximum matching in bipartite graphs. But I'm not sure if this graph is bipartite. Let me check.

Looking for bipartition: Let's try to color the graph in two colors.

Start with node 0: color it red. It's connected only to 2, so 2 must be blue. 2 is connected to 1, which must be red. 1 is connected to 4, which must be blue. 4 is connected to 3, which must be red. 3 is connected to 2 (blue) and 4 (blue). Wait, 3 is red, connected to 2 (blue) which is fine. So the graph is bipartite with partitions red {0,1,3} and blue {2,4}.

Since it's bipartite, Konig's theorem applies. The size of the minimum vertex cover equals the size of the maximum matching.

So I need to find a maximum matching. Let's see.

A matching is a set of edges without common vertices. Let's find the largest possible.

Looking at the edges:

Possible matchings:

Option 1: (2,1), (2,3), (1,4). Wait, no, because 2 is connected to both 1 and 3, so if I include (2,1), I can't include (2,3). So perhaps another approach.

Let me try to find a maximum matching:

One possible matching is (2,1), (4,3). Are these edges disjoint? Yes, because 2 and 4 are different, and 1 and 3 are different. So that's two edges.

Is there a larger matching? Let's see:

Another option: (2,0), (1,4), (2,3). Wait, no, because (2,0) and (2,3) share node 2, so they can't both be in the same matching. So the maximum matching might be size 2.

Another option: (2,1), (4,3) as before. So maximum matching size is 2.

By Konig's theorem, the minimum vertex cover size is equal to the maximum matching size, which is 2.

Wait, but I thought Konig's theorem applies to bipartite graphs. Yes, so the minimum vertex cover should be 2.

Now, what are the possible vertex covers of size 2?

Let me check each option:

Option A: [2,3]. Let's see if this covers all edges.

- Edge (2,1): 2 is in the set, so covered.
- Edge (2,0): 2 is in the set, covered.
- Edge (2,3): 3 is in the set, covered.
- Edge (1,4): Hmm, neither 1 nor 4 is in the set. So this edge is not covered. So option A is invalid.

Option B: [0,2]. Let's check:

- Edge (2,1): covered by 2.
- Edge (2,0): covered by 0.
- Edge (2,3): covered by 2.
- Edge (1,4): Neither 1 nor 4 is in the set. So this edge isn't covered. So B is invalid.

Option D: [1,3]. Check:

- Edge (2,1): 1 is present, covered.
- Edge (2,0): 2 is not in the set, 0 isn't either. So this edge isn't covered. So D is invalid.

Option G: [2,4]. Let's see:

- Edge (2,1): 2 covers it.
- Edge (2,0): 2 covers.
- Edge (2,3): 2 covers.
- Edge (1,4): 4 is present, covers it.
- Edge (4,3): 4 is present, covers it.

Wait, yes! So all edges are covered by [2,4]. So that's a vertex cover of size 2. So G is a possible answer.

Wait, but waitâ€”earlier I thought the minimum size was 2, so perhaps that's the answer.

Wait, let me check other options to see if there's a smaller size. But according to Konig's theorem, the minimum is 2, so the options with size 2 are the candidates.

So the correct vertex cover could be [2,4], which is option G.

Wait, but let me make sure. Are there any other vertex covers of size 2?

Another option: [2,4] as in G, which works.

Another possible set: [1,4]?

Check:

Edge (2,1): 1 is present, covered.
Edge (2,0): Neither 2 nor 0 is in the set. So this edge isn't covered. So [1,4] is invalid.

Another option: [3,4].

Edge (2,3): 3 is present, covered.
Edge (2,1): 1 is not present, 2 is not present. Edge not covered. So invalid.

Another option: [2,1]. Let's check:

Edge (2,0): 2 is present, covered.
Edge (1,4): 1 is present, covered.
Edge (2,3): 2 is present, covered.
Edge (4,3): 4 is not present, 3 is not present. So edge (4,3) isn't covered. So this set is invalid.

So the only valid vertex cover of size 2 is [2,4], which is option G.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options given are A through J. Option G is [2,4].

So the answer should be G.

The minimum vertex cover of the graph is [2,4], which ensures all edges are covered.
