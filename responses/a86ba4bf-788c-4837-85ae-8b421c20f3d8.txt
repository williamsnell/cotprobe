Okay, so I have this question about the third cranial nerve and the effects of trauma to the orbit. Let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that the third cranial nerve, also known as the oculomotor nerve, has several functions. It's responsible for eye movement, pupil constriction, and eyelid elevation. So if there's damage to this nerve, those functions might be affected.

The question mentions trauma to the orbit. The orbit is the bony structure around the eye, so any injury there could potentially affect the nerves and muscles in that area. The third cranial nerve passes through the orbit, so damage there could directly impact the nerve.

Looking at the options:

A: Loss of sensation in the face. Wait, sensation in the face is usually handled by the trigeminal nerve, which is the fifth cranial nerve. So probably not A.

B: Pupillary constriction. The third nerve controls the pupil via the sphincter muscles. Constriction happens when the nerve is functioning. If the nerve is damaged, the pupil wouldn't constrict, so it would dilate. So B is the opposite effect; maybe not the answer.

C: Bitemporal hemianopia. That's a loss of the outer half of both visual fields, typically caused by lesions in the optic chiasm, like in pituitary tumors. The third nerve is more about movement and pupil response, so probably not C.

D: Ptosis. Ptosis is drooping of the upper eyelid. The third nerve innervates the levator palpebrae superioris muscle, which raises the eyelid. If the nerve is damaged, the eyelid can't lift, causing ptosis. So D sounds like a possible effect.

E: Loss of vision in both eyes. That's more about the optic nerves or the eyes themselves. The third nerve doesn't carry visual information, so E is unlikely.

F: Complete blindness in the affected eye. Again, that's about the optic nerve or the eye. The third nerve's damage would affect movement and pupil, not cause blindness.

G: Loss of hearing. Hearing is handled by cranial nerves like VII (facial) and VIII (auditory). So G is unrelated.

So putting it together, the likely effect is ptosis, which is option D.

The third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve) is responsible for eye movement, pupil constriction, and eyelid elevation. Trauma to the orbit can damage this nerve, leading to issues like ptosis, where the upper eyelid droops due to the loss of innervation to the levator palpebrae superioris muscle. 

Answer: D
