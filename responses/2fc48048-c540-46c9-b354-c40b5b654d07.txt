Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to round the number 0.1476 to different decimal places and choose the correct options from A to J. Let me break this down step by step because I want to make sure I get it right.

First, the number is 0.1476. I think that's four decimal places, right? So, the digits after the decimal are 1, 4, 7, 6. Let me confirm that: 0.1 is tenths, 0.04 is hundredths, 0.007 is thousandths, and 0.0006 is ten-thousandths. Yep, that's correct.

The question has three parts: rounding to 2 decimal places (a), 3 decimal places (b), and 1 decimal place (c). I'll tackle each part one by one.

Starting with part (a): rounding to 2 decimal places. I remember that when rounding, I look at the digit after the place I'm rounding to. So, for two decimal places, I look at the third decimal place. In 0.1476, the third decimal is 7. The rule is that if the next digit is 5 or higher, I round up. So, 7 is higher than 5, which means I round the second decimal place up. The second decimal is 4, so adding 1 makes it 5. Therefore, 0.1476 rounded to two decimals is 0.15. I think that's correct.

Next, part (b): rounding to 3 decimal places. Now, I need to look at the fourth decimal place, which is 6. Since 6 is greater than or equal to 5, I round up the third decimal place. The third decimal is 7, so adding 1 makes it 8. So, 0.1476 rounded to three decimals is 0.148. That seems right.

Now, part (c): rounding to 1 decimal place. Here, I look at the second decimal place, which is 4. Since 4 is less than 5, I don't round up. So, the first decimal stays as it is. Therefore, 0.1476 rounded to one decimal place is 0.1. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 0.1476 is 0.1 when rounded to one decimal? No, wait. Let me think again. The first decimal is 1, and the next digit is 4. Since 4 is less than 5, I leave the 1 as it is and drop the rest. So, yes, it's 0.1. Wait, but wait a second. Is that correct? Because 0.1476 is closer to 0.1 than to 0.2, right? Because 0.15 would round up to 0.2, but 0.1476 is just 0.1476, which is less than 0.15, so it should round down to 0.1. So, yes, I think that's correct.

Now, I need to match these results to the options given. Let me look at each option:

Option A: (a) .15, (b) .148, (c) .1. That matches what I got: a is .15, b is .148, c is .1. So that seems correct.

Option B: (a) .15, (b) .147, (c) .14. Wait, for part (b), I have .148, so B's (b) is .147, which is wrong. So B is out.

Option C: (a) .14, (b) .148, (c) .2. (a) is wrong because I got .15 for (a). So C is out.

Option D: (a) .14, (b) .149, (c) .14. (a) is wrong, so D is out.

Option E: (a) .15, (b) .149, (c) .15. (b) is wrong because it's .149, but I have .148. So E is out.

Option F: (a) .14, (b) .147, (c) .2. (a) is wrong, F is out.

Option G: (a) .15, (b) .147, (c) .2. (b) is wrong, so G is out.

Option H: (a) .15, (b) .149, (c) .1. (b) is wrong, so H is out.

Option I: (a) .14, (b) .147, (c) .1. (a) is wrong, so I is out.

Option J: (a) .14, (b) .148, (c) .15. (a) is wrong because I have .15, but J's (a) is .14. So J is out.

Wait, but looking back, I thought option A was correct because it matches all three parts. Let me double-check my rounding for part (c). Did I make a mistake there? Because 0.1476 to one decimal place: the first decimal is 1, the second is 4. Since 4 is less than 5, it rounds down, so 0.1. So yes, part (c) is .1, which is in option A. So option A is correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought sometimes when the number is exactly halfway, like 0.145, it rounds up, but 0.1476 is more than that. Wait, no, for one decimal place, it's the second decimal that matters. So 0.1476 is 0.1 when rounded to one decimal because the second digit is 4, which is less than 5. So yes, option A's (c) is .1, which is correct.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option A.

The correct answer is option A because it correctly rounds 0.1476 to 0.15, 0.148, and 0.1 for parts (a), (b), and (c) respectively.
