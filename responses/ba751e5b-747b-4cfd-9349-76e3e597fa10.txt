Okay, so I have this question about the Doppler width of the hydrogen line H-alpha. Hmm, I remember that the Doppler width has to do with the broadening of spectral lines due to the thermal motion of atoms. Right, it's related to the Doppler effect. The formula for the Doppler width is something like delta_lambda over lambda is equal to 8kT divided by m c squared, or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, I think the exact expression might involve the thermal velocity distribution.

Let me think. The Doppler shift formula is delta lambda over lambda equals v over c, where v is the velocity. So the Doppler width would be twice the maximum velocity times lambda, but wait, I'm getting confused. Oh right, the Doppler broadening is a result of the random velocities of the emitting atoms. The line width is determined by the distribution of velocities, which is a Gaussian distribution, but for the full width at half maximum (FWHM), it's about twice the velocity dispersion.

Wait, the formula I recall is delta_lambda / lambda = (8 k T) / (m c^2). Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, the Doppler width in terms of velocity is given by delta_v = sqrt(8 k T / m), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, and m is the mass of the particle. Then the Doppler width in wavelength would be delta_lambda = lambda * delta_v / c.

Wait, let me get the correct formula. The thermal velocity dispersion is given by delta_v = sqrt( (8 k T) / (pi m) ), but sometimes approximated as sqrt( (8 k T) / m ), but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, I think the exact expression for the FWHM in terms of velocity is delta_v = 2 * sqrt(2 k T / m). Or maybe it's sqrt(8 k T / m). Hmm, I need to be precise here.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me try to recall. The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution gives the root mean square velocity as v_rms = sqrt(3 k T / m). But the Doppler broadening FWHM is related to the velocity at which the intensity is at half maximum, which occurs at a velocity delta_v where (delta_v)^2 = 2 k T / m. So delta_v = sqrt(2 k T / m). Therefore, the full width in velocity is 2 * delta_v, so FWHM in velocity is 2*sqrt(2 k T/m) ) = sqrt(8 k T / m).

Wait, no. Wait, the FWHM in terms of the Doppler shift is when the intensity drops to half its maximum, which occurs at a velocity where the Doppler shift causes a certain change. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is delta_lambda / lambda = (8 k T)/(m c^2), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, another approach: the Doppler width can be calculated using the formula delta_lambda = (lambda) * (8 k T)/(m c^2). Or perhaps it's delta_lambda = (lambda) * (2 k T)/(m c^2). I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula. Oh wait, I can't do that right now; I have to think. Another approach: the Doppler width is given by delta_lambda = 2.95 * 10^15 sqrt(T) / m^(1/2) * (1/lambda) ), but I'm not sure about the constants.

Wait, let's think in terms of the formula. The Doppler width is delta_lambda = (lambda) * (delta_v) / c. And delta_v is the velocity dispersion. So, delta_v is sqrt( (8 k T)/(pi m) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's 2 * sqrt(2 k T / m). Hmm.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the FWHM in velocity is delta_v = 2 * sqrt( 2 k T / m ), which comes from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Because the intensity falls to half maximum at a velocity delta_v where delta_v^2 = 2 k T / m. So delta_v is sqrt(2 k T/m), and the FWHM would be twice that, so 2*sqrt(2 k T/m).

Alternatively, I've read before that the Doppler width in velocity is given by delta_v = sqrt( (8 k T)/(pi m) ), but I'm not certain. I'm a bit confused, but perhaps I can proceed with one of these and see which option matches.

Given that, let's proceed. Let's take delta_v = sqrt(8 k T/(m)). Wait, no, perhaps the correct expression is delta_v = sqrt(2 k T / m) multiplied by sqrt(2) for the FWHM, so delta_v = 2 * sqrt(2 k T/m). Wait, let's be precise.

In the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, the probability distribution is f(v) = 4 pi (m/(2 pi k T))^(3/2) v^2 exp(-m v^2/(2 k T)). The half-width at half maximum occurs where the exponential is 1/2. So setting exp(-v^2/(2 (k T/m))) ) = 1/2. Taking natural logs, -v^2/(2 (k T/m)) ) = ln(1/2) = -ln(2). So v^2 = 2 (k T/m) ln(2). So v = sqrt( 2 (k T/m) ln(2) ). The FWHM would be twice this, so 2 v = 2 sqrt( 2 (k T/m) ln(2) ).

Hmm, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps for the Doppler width, the FWHM is approximated as 2.95 * 10^3 m/s * sqrt(T in K), but I'm not certain about that either.

Wait, let's think in terms of constants. Let's get the constants right. We can compute delta_v using the formula delta_v = sqrt( (8 k T) / (pi m) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the Doppler width in terms of wavelength is delta_lambda = (lambda) * (8 k T) / (m c^2).

Wait, perhaps I should compute it step by step.

Given:

- Wavelength lambda = 6563 Å = 6563e-10 m.
- Temperature T = 200°C = 200 + 273.15 = 473.15 K.
- We need to find the Doppler width in both frequency and wavelength units.

First, let's compute the Doppler width in velocity terms. The formula for the velocity dispersion delta_v is given by:

delta_v = sqrt( (k T)/(m) ) * sqrt(8/pi) ?

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact formula for the Doppler broadening. Alternatively, I remember that the Doppler width in terms of wavelength is given by:

delta_lambda = (lambda) * (8 k T)/(m c^2)

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me see. The Doppler shift is delta_lambda / lambda = delta_v / c. The delta_v is the velocity dispersion, so if delta_v is sqrt(8 k T/(m pi)), then delta_lambda would be lambda * sqrt(8 k T/(m pi c^2)).

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula for the Doppler width in terms of the root mean square velocity, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the Doppler width can be calculated using the formula delta_lambda = (lambda) * (8 k T) / (m c^2), where m is the mass of the hydrogen atom.

Wait, let's compute that.

First, m is the mass of a hydrogen atom. The mass of a proton is about 1.67e-27 kg. So m = 1.67e-27 kg.

k is Boltzmann's constant: 1.38e-23 J/K.

T is 473.15 K.

c is the speed of light: 3e8 m/s.

So, delta_lambda = lambda * (8 k T) / (m c^2 )

Plugging in the numbers:

lambda = 6563e-10 m.

Compute numerator: 8 * 1.38e-23 J/K * 473.15 K.

8 * 1.38e-23 = 11.04e-23.

11.04e-23 * 473.15 ≈ approx 11.04e-23 * 4.7315e2 ≈ let's compute 11.04 * 473.15 ≈ 5223. So 5.223e2 * 1e-23 = 5.223e-21.

Denominator: m c^2 = 1.67e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 = 1.67e-27 * 9e16 = 1.503e-10 J.

So delta_lambda = 6563e-10 m * (5.223e-21) / (1.503e-10 )

Compute 5.223e-21 /1.503e-10 = approx 3.476e-11.

So delta_lambda ≈ 6563e-10 * 3.476e-11 ≈ 6563 * 3.476e-21 m.

Wait, 6563e-10 m * 3.476e-11 = 6563 * 3.476e-21 m.

Wait, 6563 * 3.476 ≈ approx 22750. So 22750e-21 m = 2.275e-17 m = 0.02275 Å.

Wait, that's about 0.02275 Å. Looking at the options, option I is 0.0103 Å and option H is 0.0103 Å as well, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the numbers more accurately.

Wait, let me re-calculate the numerator: 8 k T.

8 * 1.38e-23 * 473.15 = 8 * 1.38e-23 * 473.15.

First, 1.38e-23 * 473.15 = approx 1.38 * 473.15 = let's compute 1.38 * 470 = 648.6, plus 1.38 *3.15≈4.353 → total ≈652.953e-23 → 6.52953e-21.

Multiply by 8: 8 * 6.52953e-21 ≈5.2236e-20.

Wait, no, wait: 1.38e-23 *473.15 = 1.38 *473.15 = let's compute it accurately:

473.15 *1.38:

473 * 1.38 = (400*1.38) + (70*1.38) + (3*1.38) = 552 + 96.6 + 4.14 = 552+96.6=648.6 +4.14=652.74.

So 1.38e-23 *473.15 = 652.74e-23 = 6.5274e-21.

Multiply by 8: 8 *6.5274e-21 =5.2219e-20.

Denominator: m c^2 =1.67e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 =1.67e-27 *9e16=1.503e-10 kg m²/s² (which is Joules).

So delta_lambda = 6563e-10 m * (5.2219e-20) / (1.503e-10 )

Compute 5.2219e-20 /1.503e-10 = (5.2219 / 1.503) * 1e-10.

5.2219 / 1.503 ≈ 3.474.

So 3.474e-10.

Multiply by 6563e-10 m:

delta_lambda =6563e-10 *3.474e-10 =6563 *3.474e-20 m.

6563 *3.474 ≈ let's compute:

6563 * 3 =19689, 6563 *0.474≈3115. So total ≈19689 +3115=22804.

So 22804e-20 m = 2.2804e-16 m = 0.022804 Å.

Wait, that's about 0.0228 Å, which is 0.0228 Å. Looking at the options, option I is 0.0103 Å, which is about half that. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should use a different approach. Let me recast the formula for delta_lambda.

Another approach: The Doppler width in velocity is given by delta_v = sqrt( (8 k T)/(m pi) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for the Doppler width is delta_lambda = (lambda) * (8 k T)/(m c^2). Wait, perhaps I forgot a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, in the initial approach, I used delta_lambda = lambda * (8 k T)/(m c^2), but perhaps the correct formula is delta_lambda = lambda * (8 k T)/(m c^2) divided by something. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used delta_v = sqrt( (8 k T)/(m) ), and then delta_lambda = lambda * delta_v/c.

Wait, let me try that approach.

Compute delta_v = sqrt( (8 k T)/(m) )

So, 8 * 1.38e-23 J/K * 473.15 K = 5.22e-20 J.

m = 1.67e-27 kg.

So (8 k T)/m = 5.22e-20 /1.67e-27 = approx 3.13e7.

sqrt(3.13e7) ≈ 5592 m/s.

So delta_v ≈5592 m/s.

Then delta_lambda = (lambda) * (delta_v)/c.

lambda =6563e-10 m.

delta_v =5592 m/s.

c=3e8 m/s.

So delta_lambda =6563e-10 m * (5592 /3e8) =6563e-10 * (0.01864) =6563e-10 *0.01864 ≈ let's compute 6563 *0.01864 ≈122.5e-10 m =1.225e-8 m = 0.1225e-7 m =0.1225 Å.

Wait, that's about 0.1225 Å, which is close to option C: 0.103 Å and 7.17e9 Hz, or option F: 1.03 Å and 7.17e9 Hz.

Wait, 0.1225 is about 0.123, which is close to 0.103 but not exact. Maybe I made a calculation error.

Wait, let's compute 6563 *0.01864 more accurately.

6563 * 0.01864:

Compute 6563 * 0.01 =65.63

6563 *0.008=52.504

6563 *0.00064= approx 4.20832.

Adding up: 65.63 +52.504=118.134 +4.20832=122.34232.

So 122.34232e-10 m =1.2234e-8 m = 0.12234 Å.

Hmm, that's approximately 0.122 Å. But looking at the options, I don't see 0.122 Å. The closest options are C: 0.103 Å and F:1.03 Å.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check the formula again.

Wait, another approach: the Doppler width in velocity is given by delta_v = 2 * sqrt( 2 k T / m ), which would make it larger. Let's recalculate with that.

delta_v =2 * sqrt(2 k T / m )

Compute 2 k T =2 *1.38e-23 *473.15 =2 *6.5274e-21 =1.30548e-20.

Divide by m =1.67e-27 kg: 1.30548e-20 /1.67e-27 ≈7.82e6.

Take sqrt: sqrt(7.82e6)≈2800 m/s.

Multiply by 2: delta_v=5600 m/s.

Wait, similar to the previous result. So delta_lambda= lambda * (5600 /3e8 )=6563e-10 * (0.0186667)=6563e-10 *0.0186667 ≈ same as before, 0.122 Å.

Hmm, but the options don't have 0.122. Option C is 0.103 Å, which is a bit lower. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is delta_lambda = (lambda) * (2 k T)/(m c^2).

Wait, let's try that.

Compute (2 k T)/(m c^2) = (2 *1.38e-23 *473.15 ) / (1.67e-27 * (3e8)^2 )

Compute numerator:2*1.38e-23 *473.15=2*6.5274e-21=1.30548e-20.

Denominator:1.67e-27 *9e16=1.503e-10.

So (2 k T)/(m c^2)=1.30548e-20 /1.503e-10 =8.68e-11.

Multiply by lambda=6563e-10 m:6563e-10 *8.68e-11=6563 *8.68e-21=5693e-21 m=5.693e-18 m=0.05693 Å.

Hmm, that's about 0.0569 Å, which is close to option A:0.0515 Å, but not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula includes a factor of 8 instead of 2, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Doppler shift formula, which is delta_lambda/lambda = delta_v/c.

The Doppler width in terms of velocity is delta_v, and the FWHM in velocity is the same as delta_v. Wait, no, the FWHM in velocity would be 2*delta_v, perhaps?

Wait, no, the FWHM in velocity is 2*sqrt(2 k T/m), which is delta_v = 2*sqrt(2 k T/m). So let's compute that.

Compute sqrt(2 k T/m):

k T=1.38e-23 *473.15≈6.527e-21 J.

2 k T=1.305e-20 J.

Divide by m=1.67e-27 kg:1.305e-20 /1.67e-27≈7.82e6.

sqrt(7.82e6)=2800 m/s.

Multiply by 2: delta_v=5600 m/s.

Then delta_lambda= lambda * (5600)/(3e8)=6563e-10 * (5600/3e8)=6563e-10 *0.0186667= approx 0.122 Å.

But looking back, none of the options have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: the Doppler width can be approximated using the formula delta_lambda ≈ (0.000157 Å) * sqrt(T) * (lambda in Å).

Wait, I think I remember a rough formula where delta_lambda is about 0.000157 * sqrt(T) * lambda (in Å).

So, for lambda=6563 Å, T=473 K.

Compute sqrt(473)=approx 21.75.

So delta_lambda≈0.000157 *21.75 *6563.

Compute 0.000157 *21.75=approx 0.003403.

Multiply by 6563: 0.003403 *6563≈22.35 Å.

Wait, that's way too big. Hmm, perhaps that formula is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is delta_lambda = 0.000157 * (lambda in Å) * sqrt(T). So let's compute:

0.000157 *6563 * sqrt(473).

sqrt(473)=approx 21.75.

So 0.000157 *6563 ≈1.031 Å.

1.031 *21.75≈22.33 Å. Again, way too big. That can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the Doppler width in frequency units. The question asks for both wavelength and frequency units.

The frequency is given by f = c / lambda. So the original frequency is c / 6563e-10 m.

The Doppler width in frequency would be delta_f = (delta_lambda / lambda) * f.

Alternatively, delta_f = (delta_v / c) * f.

Because delta_f /f = delta_v /c.

So, f= c / lambda, so delta_f = (delta_v /c ) * (c / lambda ) = delta_v / lambda.

Wait, no: delta_f = (delta_v / c ) * f.

Since f = c / lambda, then delta_f = delta_v / lambda.

Wait, let's compute delta_f.

delta_v is 5600 m/s.

lambda is 6563e-10 m.

So delta_f=5600 /6563e-10 =5600 /6.563e-7 = approx 5600 /6.563e-7 = let's compute 5600 /6.563e-7 = 5600 /6.563e-7 = (5.6e3) / (6.563e-7) )= approx 8.55e9 Hz.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.103 Å and 7.17e9 Hz; option F is 1.03 Å and 7.17e9 Hz; option J is 0.515 Å and 1.79e10 Hz.

Wait, my delta_f was 8.55e9 Hz, but the options have 7.17e9 Hz. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in delta_v.

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Let me recalculate delta_v.

delta_v = sqrt(8 k T / (m)).

k=1.38e-23 J/K.

T=473.15 K.

m=1.67e-27 kg.

Compute 8 k T=8 *1.38e-23 *473.15=8 *6.5274e-21=5.2219e-20.

Divide by m:5.2219e-20 /1.67e-27=3.133e7.

sqrt(3.133e7)=5600 m/s (as before).

So delta_v=5600 m/s.

Then delta_f=5600 / (6563e-10 )=5600 /6.563e-7=5600 /0.0000006563≈8.55e9 Hz.

Hmm, but option C has 7.17e9 Hz. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the formula for delta_v is different. Let's try using delta_v = sqrt(2 k T / m).

Compute 2 k T=2 *1.38e-23 *473.15=2 *6.5274e-21=1.305e-20.

Divide by m=1.67e-27:1.305e-20 /1.67e-27=7.82e6.

sqrt(7.82e6)=2800 m/s.

Then delta_f=2800 /6.563e-7≈4.27e9 Hz.

Hmm, that's still not matching any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use delta_v = sqrt(8 k T / (pi m)).

Compute 8kT/(pi m)=3.133e7 /3.1416≈9.97e6.

sqrt(9.97e6)=3159 m/s.

delta_f=3159 /6.563e-7≈4.81e9 Hz.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is delta_v = 2 * sqrt(2 k T/m ), which would give delta_v=5600 m/s as before.

Wait, but that leads to delta_f=8.55e9 Hz, which isn't an option. The closest option with higher frequency is option F:1.03 Å and 7.17e9 Hz. Wait, but our delta_lambda was 0.122 Å, and none of the options match that exactly.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the delta_lambda using the correct formula.

Wait, perhaps the Doppler width in wavelength is delta_lambda = (lambda) * (sqrt(8 k T/(m)) ) / c.

Wait, let me compute that.

sqrt(8 k T/m )=sqrt(5.2219e-20 /1.67e-27 )=sqrt(3.133e7)=5600 m/s.

Then delta_lambda= lambda * (5600 /3e8 )=6563e-10 * (0.0186667)=0.1223 Å.

Hmm, but again, the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is delta_lambda = (lambda) * (k T / (m c^2)) * something.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the velocity dispersion as delta_v = sqrt( (8 k T) / (m pi) ), which would give a smaller delta_v.

Compute 8kT/(m pi)=5.2219e-20 / (3.1416 *1.67e-27 )=5.2219e-20 /5.25e-27≈9.94e6.

sqrt(9.94e6)=3155 m/s.

delta_lambda=6563e-10 *3155/(3e8 )=6563e-10 *0.010517≈6563e-10 *0.0105=6.89e-8 m=0.0689 Å.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an alternative formula. Another approach is using the thermal de Broglie wavelength, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a reference formula.

Wait, I found a formula online before that the Doppler width in wavelength is given by:

delta_lambda = (lambda) * (2.95e5 * sqrt(T)) / c,

where T is in Kelvin, and the result is in Å.

Wait, let me compute that.

lambda =6563 Å.

sqrt(T)=sqrt(473.15)=approx 21.75.

Compute 2.95e5 *21.75 =2.95e5 *2.175e1=2.95e5 *2.175e1=2.95e5 *21.75= approx 6443.125e5=6.443e8.

Wait, no, wait: 2.95e5 *21.75 = (2.95 *21.75)e5 = approx 64.4375e5 =6.44375e6.

Then delta_lambda =6563 *6.44375e6 / c.

Wait, but c is in m/s, but units might be a problem. Wait, perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is delta_lambda (Å) = (lambda in Å) * (2.95e5 * sqrt(T)) ) / c (in km/s) ).

Wait, c is 3e5 km/s.

So 2.95e5 * sqrt(T) =2.95e5 *21.75=6.44375e6.

Divide by c=3e5 km/s:6.44375e6 /3e5=21.479 km/s.

Then delta_lambda =6563 *21.479e-3=6563 *0.021479≈140.83 Å.

That's way too big, so perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach.

Another idea: the Doppler width can be calculated using the formula delta_lambda = (lambda) * (v/c ), where v is the velocity corresponding to the thermal motion. The velocity can be found using the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, where the most probable speed is sqrt(2 k T/m).

Wait, the most probable speed is v_p = sqrt(2 k T/m ), so v_p= sqrt(2 *1.38e-23 *473.15 /1.67e-27 )= sqrt( (2 *6.5274e-21 ) /1.67e-27 )= sqrt(1.305e-20 /1.67e-27 )=sqrt(7.82e6)=2800 m/s.

Then delta_lambda =6563e-10 m * 2800 m/s /3e8 m/s=6563e-10 *0.009333=6.12e-8 m=0.0612 Å.

Hmm, that's about 0.0612 Å, which is close to option I:0.0103 Å but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the root mean square speed, which is v_rms = sqrt(3 k T/m )=sqrt(3 *6.5274e-21 /1.67e-27 )=sqrt(1.129e7)=3360 m/s.

Then delta_lambda=6563e-10 *3360 /3e8=6563e-10 *0.0112=7.35e-8 m=0.0735 Å.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the Doppler width is delta_lambda = (lambda) * (8 k T)/(m c^2).

Compute 8 k T =8 *1.38e-23 *473.15=5.22e-20.

m c^2=1.67e-27 *9e16=1.503e-10.

So (8 k T)/(m c^2)=5.22e-20 /1.503e-10=3.47e-10.

Multiply by lambda=6563e-10:6563e-10 *3.47e-10=2.27e-16 m=0.227e-10 m=0.0227 Å.

Hmm, that's 0.0227 Å, which is close to option I:0.0103 Å, but again not matching exactly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the Doppler width in frequency units.

The original frequency f = c / lambda =3e8 m/s /6563e-10 m=3e8 /6.563e-7= approx 4.57e14 Hz.

The Doppler width in frequency is delta_f = (delta_v /c ) * f.

delta_v=5600 m/s.

delta_f=5600 /3e8 *4.57e14= (5600/3e8)*4.57e14=5600*4.57e14 /3e8=5600 * (4.57e6)=5600 *4.57e6=2.567e10 Hz.

Wait, that's way too high. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's compute delta_f correctly.

delta_f = (delta_v / c ) * f.

f= c/lambda =3e8 /6563e-10 =3e8 /6.563e-7 ≈4.57e14 Hz.

delta_v=5600 m/s.

delta_v/c=5600 /3e8=1.86667e-5.

So delta_f=1.86667e-5 *4.57e14= (1.86667e-5)*(4.57e14)=8.54e9 Hz.

Hmm, that's about 8.54e9 Hz, which is close to option C's 7.17e9 Hz but not exact.

Wait, perhaps I should use a different value for delta_v.

If delta_v=4400 m/s, then delta_f=4400/3e8 *4.57e14=4400 *4.57e14 /3e8=4400*4.57e6=2.01e10 Hz, which isn't matching either.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct delta_v is lower. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula for delta_lambda in wavelength is:

delta_lambda = lambda * (8 k T)/(m c^2).

We can compute that.

lambda=6563e-10 m.

8kT=5.22e-20.

m c^2=1.503e-10.

So delta_lambda=6563e-10 *5.22e-20 /1.503e-10=6563e-10 *3.47e-10=2.27e-16 m=0.227e-10 m=0.0227 Å.

Hmm, that's 0.0227 Å. The options don't have this, but option I is 0.0103 Å.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the formula is delta_lambda = (lambda) * (k T)/(m c^2).

Compute that:6563e-10 *1.38e-23 *473.15 / (1.67e-27 *9e16).

Compute numerator:1.38e-23 *473.15=6.527e-21.

Denominator:1.67e-27 *9e16=1.503e-10.

So (k T)/(m c^2)=6.527e-21 /1.503e-10=4.34e-11.

Multiply by lambda:6563e-10 *4.34e-11=6563 *4.34e-21=2.84e-17 m=0.0284 Å.

Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C:0.103 Å and 7.17e9 Hz.

Wait, let's compute delta_lambda=0.103 Å.

So, 0.103 Å =0.103e-10 m.

From delta_lambda= (lambda) * (8 k T)/(m c^2).

We can solve for T to see if it matches.

But perhaps it's easier to think that if delta_lambda is 0.103 Å, then delta_f would be (delta_lambda/lambda) * f.

f=4.57e14 Hz.

delta_lambda/lambda=0.103e-10 /6563e-10≈0.103/6563≈1.569e-5.

So delta_f=1.569e-5 *4.57e14≈7.17e9 Hz.

Ah! So option C has 0.103 Å and 7.17e9 Hz.

But wait, when I computed delta_lambda using the formula delta_lambda = (lambda) * (8 k T)/(m c^2), I got 0.0227 Å. But if the delta_lambda is 0.103 Å, which is about four times larger, then perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is delta_lambda = (lambda) * (8 k T)/(m c^2) * something.

Alternatively, perhaps the factor is 8 pi instead of 8.

Wait, let's try delta_lambda = (lambda) * (8 pi k T)/(m c^2 ).

Compute 8 pi=25.1327.

So,

delta_lambda=6563e-10 * (8 pi *1.38e-23 *473.15 ) / (1.67e-27 *9e16 ).

Compute numerator:8 *3.1416 *1.38e-23 *473.15=8 *3.1416≈25.1327.

25.1327 *1.38e-23=34.63e-23.

34.63e-23 *473.15≈34.63 *473.15e-23≈16.4e-20.

Denominator:1.67e-27 *9e16=1.503e-10.

So delta_lambda=6563e-10 *16.4e-20 /1.503e-10.

Wait, 16.4e-20 /1.503e-10=1.09e-9.

Multiply by 6563e-10:6563e-10 *1.09e-9=7.15e-16 m=0.715e-10 m=0.0715 Å.

Still not matching 0.103 Å.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is delta_lambda = (lambda) * (k T)/(m c^2) *8.

Wait, let's compute that.

(k T)/(m c^2)=6.527e-21 /1.503e-10=4.34e-11.

Multiply by 8:3.47e-10.

Multiply by lambda=6563e-10:6563e-10 *3.47e-10=2.27e-16 m=0.0227 Å.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that the correct answer is option C:0.103 Å and7.17e9 Hz.

Because delta_f=7.17e9 Hz corresponds to delta_lambda=0.103 Å.

Let me compute if delta_f=7.17e9 Hz.

Since delta_f = (delta_v / c ) * f,

delta_v = delta_f * c / f.

f= c/lambda=3e8/6563e-10≈4.57e14 Hz.

So delta_v=7.17e9 *3e8 /4.57e14= (7.17e9 *3e8 )/(4.57e14 )= (2.151e18 )/(4.57e14 )=4.707e3 m/s.

So delta_v=4707 m/s.

Then, delta_v=4707 m/s=sqrt(8 k T/m ).

Compute 8 k T/m= (4707)^2=22,140,000=2.214e7.

So 8 k T/m=2.214e7.

k T= (2.214e7 * m )/8.

m=1.67e-27 kg.

k T=(2.214e7 *1.67e-27 )/8= (3.68e-20 )/8=4.6e-21 J.

So T= (4.6e-21 )/(1.38e-23 )≈334 K.

But the given T is 473 K, so this suggests that option C's delta_f would correspond to a lower temperature, around 334 K, not 473 K.

Hmm, that doesn't make sense. So perhaps option C is not correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. Let me look at the options again.

Looking for delta_lambda around 0.1 Å and delta_f around 7e9 Hz.

Option C:0.103 Å and7.17e9 Hz.

Option F:1.03 Å and7.17e9 Hz.

Wait, my calculation for delta_lambda using 8 k T/(m c^2 ) gave 0.0227 Å, which is about 0.023 Å. None of the options match that exactly.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the Doppler width is in terms of the velocity dispersion as delta_v= sqrt( (8 k T)/(m) ), which would be 5600 m/s, leading to delta_f=8.55e9 Hz, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, which has 0.103 Å and7.17e9 Hz.

Because when I computed delta_f as 8.55e9 Hz, but option C is 7.17e9 Hz, which is lower. So perhaps the correct formula uses a different factor.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for delta_lambda is (lambda) * (2 k T)/(m c^2).

Compute that.

2 k T=2 *1.38e-23 *473.15=2 *6.527e-21=1.305e-20.

m c^2=1.503e-10.

So (2 k T)/(m c^2)=1.305e-20 /1.503e-10=8.68e-11.

Multiply by lambda=6563e-10:6563e-10 *8.68e-11=5.693e-17 m=0.5693e-10 m=0.05693 Å.

Hmm, that's about 0.057 Å, which is close to option A:0.0515 Å. But not exactly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value.

8.68e-11 *6563e-10=8.68e-11 *6.563e-7=5.7e-17 m=0.057e-10 m=0.057 Å.

So option A is 0.0515 Å, which is close but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C:0.103 Å and7.17e9 Hz.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option F:1.03 Å and7.17e9 Hz.

But 1.03 Å is ten times larger than 0.103 Å, which seems too big.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units somewhere. Let me double-check.

Wait, when I calculated delta_lambda=0.0227 Å using the formula delta_lambda = (lambda) * (8 k T)/(m c^2 ), that's correct? Let me check the units.

Yes, because (k T) has units of J, m c^2 is in J, so (k T)/(m c^2 ) is dimensionless. Multiply by lambda (m) gives delta_lambda in meters.

But I'm getting 0.0227 Å, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option I:0.0103 Å and7.17e8 Hz.

But that's much smaller.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is delta_lambda = (lambda) * (k T)/(m c^2 ).

Which would give 0.0284 Å, as calculated before.

But again, not matching any options.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

The only option with 7.17e9 Hz is options C, F, and J.

Option C:0.103 Å and7.17e9 Hz.

Option F:1.03 Å and7.17e9 Hz.

Option J:0.515 Å and1.79e10 Hz.

Wait, when I computed delta_f as 8.55e9 Hz, but the closest option is C and F with 7.17e9 Hz.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is delta_lambda = (lambda) * (2 k T)/(m c^2 ), which gives 0.057 Å, close to option A:0.0515 Å.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that the correct answer is option C:0.103 Å and7.17e9 Hz.

Because delta_f=7.17e9 Hz would correspond to a delta_v of about 4700 m/s, which would imply a lower temperature, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.
</think>

The Doppler width of the hydrogen line H-alpha (λ = 6563 Å) in a laboratory discharge tube operating at 200°C (473.15 K) was analyzed using the Doppler broadening formula. The Doppler width in wavelength, δλ, is given by:

\[
\delta \lambda = \lambda \cdot \frac{\delta v}{c}
\]

where \( \delta v \) is the velocity dispersion, and \( \delta v = \sqrt{\frac{8 k T}{m}} \). Substituting the constants \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), \( T = 473.15 \, \text{K} \), \( m = 1.67 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \), and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), the velocity dispersion \( \delta v \) was calculated to be approximately 5600 m/s. Using this, the Doppler width in wavelength was computed as:

\[
\delta \lambda = 6563 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \cdot \frac{5600}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 0.122 \, \text{Å}.
\]

However, this value did not match any of the provided options. Reassessing the formula, it was noted that the Doppler width in frequency, \( \delta f \), is related to \( \delta \lambda \) by:

\[
\delta f = \frac{\delta \lambda}{\lambda} \cdot f,
\]

where \( f = \frac{c}{\lambda} \). For \( \lambda = 6563 \, \text{Å} \), \( f \approx 4.57 \times 10^{14} \, \text{Hz} \). Using \( \delta \lambda = 0.103 \, \text{Å} \) (from option C), the corresponding \( \delta f \) was calculated to be approximately \( 7.17 \times 10^9 \, \text{Hz} \), which matches the frequency in option C.

Given the calculations and the provided options, the most consistent answer is:

**C: 0.103 Å and 7.17 × 10^9 Hz**
