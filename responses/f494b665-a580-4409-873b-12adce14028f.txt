Okay, so I've got this question about the resolving power of the eye and how it corresponds to a dimension on the retina. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says the resolving power is 1 minute of arc. Wait, what's a minute of arc? Oh right, a minute is 1/60 of a degree. So 1 arcminute is 1/60 degree. And degrees are a unit of angular measurement. Right.

Now, the eye's resolving power refers to the ability to distinguish between two points. So, how does that translate to the physical size on the retina? I remember something about the retina and the size of the photoreceptor cells. Oh, right, the rods and cones. The resolving power depends on the density of these receptors on the retina.

Wait, but how do I calculate the actual dimension on the retina from the angular resolution? I think there's a formula involving the angle, the distance from the lens to the retina, and the size of the feature on the retina.

So, the formula I recall is: θ (in radians) ≈ s / D, where θ is the angle, s is the size of the object, and D is the distance from the eye to the object. But wait, in this case, the object is the retina, so the distance D would be the focal length of the eye, right?

But wait, the eye's focal length when viewing a nearby object (like the retina) is about the same as the eye's structure. Wait, the retina is at the back of the eye, so the distance D is roughly the eye's diameter or something else? Or maybe the eye's optical system's focal length is about 2 cm? I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, I've heard that the resolving power is related to the spacing between photoreceptor cells. If the eye can resolve 1 arcminute, that corresponds to a certain spacing on the retina. So, the formula might involve converting the angle to radians and then multiplying by the distance to get the size.

Let me think: 1 minute of arc is 1/60 degrees. To convert that to radians, since 1 degree is π/180 radians. So 1 minute is (π/180) / 60 radians. Let me calculate that.

1 degree = π/180 ≈ 0.01745 radians. So 1 arcminute is 0.01745 / 60 ≈ 0.0002909 radians.

Now, the distance from the eye to the retina is roughly the eye's focal length. I think the average eye has a focal length of about 2 cm when looking at objects at a certain distance. Wait, no, the distance from the lens to the retina is about 2.5 cm (since the eye's diameter is about 2.5 cm). So D ≈ 25 mm or 0.025 meters.

So using the formula s = θ * D. θ is 0.0002909 radians, D is 0.025 meters. So s = 0.0002909 * 0.025 = approximately 7.2725e-6 meters, which is 7.27 micrometers.

Wait, but the options are in microns, and the closest option to 7.27 microns would be option F: 15 microns? No, wait, 7 microns isn't one of the options. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options: A is 1, B 20, C 2, D 0.5, E 50, F 15, G 10, H 30, I 5, J 100.

Hmm, 7 microns isn't there. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the distance. Maybe the distance is not 2.5 cm. Alternatively, perhaps the eye's resolving power corresponds to the spacing between photoreceptor cells, which I think are on the order of 5 microns for cones. Wait, but how does that tie into the calculation?

Wait, I've read that the human eye's resolving power is about 1 arcminute, which corresponds to the spacing between cones on the retina. So perhaps cones are spaced about 2 microns apart? Or maybe that's when the eye is focused on something at a certain distance.

Wait, another approach: the resolving power in terms of cycles per degree or line pairs per minute. But maybe I should think in terms of the formula for resolving power. The resolving power R is given by R = 1.22 * D / λ, but that's for a diffraction limit, which might not apply directly here.

Alternatively, the eye's resolving power is often quoted as being able to distinguish two points that are about 1 arcminute apart, which corresponds to the spacing between cones. So if the cones are spaced about 2 microns apart, that would correspond to 1 arcminute.

Wait, but wait, the size of a cone cell is about 2-4 microns in diameter, I think. But the spacing might be smaller. Or perhaps the spacing is such that each cone subtends about 1 arcminute at the eye when viewed at a certain distance.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula s = R * D, where R is the angle in radians and D is the distance.

So, R is 1 arcminute, which is (π/(180*60)) radians ≈ 0.0002909 rad.

D is the distance from the eye to the retina, which I think is about 2.5 cm or 0.025 meters.

So s = 0.0002909 * 0.025 = 0.0000072725 meters, which is 7.27 micrometers.

Wait, but none of the options match 7 microns. The closest is option F: 15 microns, but that's twice as much. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance is different. Maybe the distance is not 2.5 cm but something else. Wait, the retina is at the back of the eye, so the distance from the lens to the retina is approximately the eye's length, which is about 2.5 cm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate:

0.0002909 radians * 0.025 meters = 0.0002909 * 0.025 = 0.0000072725 meters, which is 7.27 micrometers. So approximately 7 microns.

But the options don't have 7 microns. Let me check the options again.

The options are A:1, B:20, C:2, D:0.5, E:50, F:15, G:10, H:30, I:5, J:100.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion. Let me double-check.

Wait, 1 arcminute is 1/60 degree. 1 degree is 60 arcminutes. So 1 arcminute is (π/180) / 60 radians, which is π/(180*60) = π/(10800) ≈ 2.90888e-4 radians.

So θ ≈ 0.000290888 radians.

D is 25 mm, which is 0.025 meters.

So s = θ * D = 0.000290888 * 0.025 = 0.0000072722 meters, which is 7.27 micrometers.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the size of the photoreceptor cells. I think the cones are about 2-4 micrometers in diameter. So if the resolving power is 1 arcminute, the corresponding size on the retina would be about 2 microns. That would make option C: 2 microns the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the formula for the minimum resolvable distance on the retina. The minimum distance s that can be resolved is given by s = (θ * D), where θ is in radians and D is the distance from the eye to the object.

So, using θ = 1 arcminute converted to radians, and D the distance to the retina as approximately 25 mm.

So, s = θ_rad * D

θ_rad = (1/60) * (π/180) ≈ 2.90888e-4 radians.

D = 0.025 meters.

s ≈ 2.90888e-4 * 0.025 ≈ 7.27e-6 meters = 7.27 micrometers.

But the options don't have this. Wait, perhaps the distance is 2.5 cm, which is 25 mm or 0.025 m? Wait, I think I got that right.

Wait, maybe the actual distance is not 25 mm. Let me think: the eye's optical system focuses the image on the retina, which is about 2.5 cm behind the cornea. So yes, D is 25 mm or 0.025 m.

Hmm, so s is about 7.27 micrometers, but the options don't have that. The closest higher option is F:15 microns, which is about twice as big. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the angle should be in the other way. Let me think again: the resolving power is 1 arcminute, so the eye can distinguish two points that are at least 1 arcminute apart. So the size of the feature on the retina would correspond to that angle.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the eye's resolving power in terms of the spacing between photoreceptor cells. So if the eye can resolve 1 arcminute, the spacing between cones should correspond to that angle when viewed from the lens.

So, the formula is: s = θ * D.

θ is 1 arcminute = 0.000290888 radians.

D is 0.025 m.

s ≈ 0.000290888 * 0.025 = 0.0000072722 m = 7.27 micrometers.

Hmm. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the distance is not 25 mm.

Wait, maybe the distance is the eye's diameter, which is about 2.5 cm, so 25 mm. But that's what I used.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the size of the image on the retina, not the photoreceptor size. So, if the eye can resolve 1 arcminute, what's the corresponding linear dimension on the retina.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the eye's focal length when looking at a standard distance, like 25 cm or something, but that might complicate things.

Wait, another approach: the resolving power of the eye is often given as approximately 2 minutes of arc, which corresponds to about 1.5 arcminutes. Wait, but the question says 1 minute, which is higher resolution.

Wait, but perhaps the formula is s = (θ * D) / 2. Because sometimes in resolving two points, the formula is s = θ * D, but maybe in terms of the spacing between two points, it's half that? Or wait, maybe I'm confusing it with something else.

Wait, no, the formula s = θ * D gives the size of the object that subtends an angle θ at a distance D. So for two points to be resolvable, the distance between them should be at least s, where s = θ * D.

So in this case, s is the separation on the retina that corresponds to 1 arcminute as seen from the lens.

So, s = 0.000290888 rad * 0.025 m = 7.27 micrometers.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing a factor. Maybe the eye's resolving power is based on the diffraction limit, but I think that's a different consideration.

Wait, another thought: the eye can resolve details down to about 1 arcminute, which corresponds to the spacing between cones. I've read that the spacing between cones is about 2-4 micrometers. So perhaps the answer is 2 micrometers, which is option C.

Alternatively, maybe the calculation gives about 7 micrometers, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is 2 microns, which is option C.

Wait, but why would the calculation give 7 microns and the option is 2? Maybe I made a mistake in the distance. Let me check the distance again.

Wait, perhaps the distance from the lens to the retina is not 25 mm. Let me think: the eye's structure. The cornea has a radius of about 12 mm. The lens is inside, so the distance from the cornea to the retina is about 25 mm. So, yes, D is 25 mm.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the eye's ability to resolve based on the photoreceptor density. The density of cones is about 100,000 per mm² at the fovea. So, if the resolving power is 1 arcminute, the spacing between cones would be s = (1 arcminute) * (distance).

Wait, but that's the same calculation as before. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the angular resolution and the spacing on the retina. The formula is: angular resolution (in radians) = (spacing between photoreceptors) / (distance from eye to retina).

So, rearranged, spacing = angular resolution * distance.

So, 1 arcminute = (π/(180*60)) radians ≈ 2.908e-4 rad.

So spacing s = 2.908e-4 * 0.025 m = 7.27e-6 m = 7.27 micrometers.

But none of the options match that. Wait, but maybe the question is about the size of the photoreceptor, not the spacing. So if the spacing is about 7 microns, perhaps the size is about 2 microns, which is option C.

Alternatively, maybe the calculation is off because I used the wrong distance. Let me think: perhaps the distance from the lens to the retina is not 25 mm but 20 mm or something else? No, I think it's about 25 mm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects a different approach. Maybe using the formula for the resolving power in terms of the diameter of the pupil and the wavelength, but that's probably not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the minimum resolvable feature on the retina, which is the size of a cone cell. If the cones are about 2 microns in diameter, then the answer would be option C: 2 microns.

But I'm still a bit confused because the calculation gave me around 7 microns, but that's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is 2 microns, which is option C.

The resolving power of the eye is 1 minute of arc, which corresponds to the ability to distinguish between two points separated by that angular resolution. To determine the corresponding dimension on the retina, we use the formula:

\[
s = \theta \cdot D
\]

where:
- \( \theta \) is the angular resolution in radians,
- \( D \) is the distance from the eye to the retina.

### Step 1: Convert 1 minute of arc to radians
1 minute of arc is \( \frac{1}{60} \) degrees. Converting to radians:
\[
\theta = \frac{\pi}{180 \cdot 60} \approx 2.90888 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{radians}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine the distance to the retina
The distance from the eye to the retina (\( D \)) is approximately the focal length of the eye, which is about 25 mm or \( 0.025 \, \text{meters} \).

### Step 3: Calculate the corresponding dimension on the retina
\[
s = \theta \cdot D = (2.90888 \times 10^{-4}) \cdot 0.025 = 7.2722 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{meters} = 7.27 \, \mu\text{m}.
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
The calculated value of \( 7.27 \, \mu\text{m} \) does not match any of the provided options. However, the size of photoreceptor cells (cones) on the retina is typically around 2–4 micrometers. Given the options, the closest plausible answer is **2 microns**, which corresponds to the spacing between photoreceptors that the eye can resolve.

### Conclusion
The resolving power of 1 minute of arc corresponds to a dimension on the retina of approximately **2 microns**, which is option C.
