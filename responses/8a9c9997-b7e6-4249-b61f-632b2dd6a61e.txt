Options:

D: 393 ÷ 3
E: (393 + 3) ÷ 3
F: 393 × 3
G: 393 + 3
H: 393 – 3
I: 3 - 393
J: 3 ÷ 393

Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the problem is about a tournament with 393 players, and each team has 3 players. I need to find the expression that shows how to calculate the number of teams.

Hmm, so if there are 393 players and each team has 3, I think I need to divide the total number of players by the number of players per team. That makes sense because if each team has 3, then the total teams would be 393 divided by 3. 

Let me look at the options. Option D is 393 ÷ 3, which sounds right. The other options don't seem to fit. For example, option A is adding 3 and 393, which would give the total players, but we already know that. Option B is multiplying 3 by 393, which would give a much larger number, more than the total players, so that's not it.

Options C and E involve subtraction and addition before division, but I don't think that's necessary here. Option F is multiplying, again too big. G is addition, H is subtraction, which doesn't make sense in this context. I and J involve reversing the numbers, which would give the wrong result, especially since J would be a very small number.

So, the correct approach is to divide the total players by the number per team. That points me to option D.

The number of teams is found by dividing the total players by the number of players per team. So, 393 ÷ 3 is the correct expression.

Answer: D
