Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here about calculating the change in entropy, ΔS, for a system when the state of a gas changes. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says that we have 3.00 moles of a perfect gas, and it's undergoing a change. The gas is made up of atoms, so I think that means it's monoatomic. The molar heat capacity at constant pressure, Cp,m, is given as (5/2)R. Wait, for monoatomic gases, Cp is (5/2)R, and Cv is (3/2)R, right? Because degrees of freedom for translation are 3, so Cv = (3/2)R, and Cp is Cv + R = (5/2)R. Okay, that makes sense.

The initial state is 25°C and 1.00 atm. The final state is 125°C and 5.00 atm. So, we're changing both the temperature and the pressure. Since both are changing, I can't just use the entropy formula for constant temperature or constant pressure. I think I need to consider the entropy change for each process and add them up.

Wait, entropy change for an ideal gas can be calculated using the formula ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1) - n R ln(P2/P1), right? Or wait, is that correct? Or maybe it's split into two steps: one where the pressure is kept constant while temperature changes, and another where the temperature is kept constant while pressure changes. Or perhaps it's better to just use the combined formula for entropy change when both T and P change.

Let me think. The general formula for the entropy change of an ideal gas when both temperature and pressure change is:

ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1) - n R ln(P2/P1)

Wait, is that right? Because entropy change for a process can be calculated as the integral of dQ_rev / T. For ideal gases, dQ_rev at constant pressure is Cp dT, and at constant volume, it's Cv dT. But when both T and P change, you have to account for both.

Another approach is to split the process into two steps: first, change the temperature at constant pressure, then change the pressure at constant temperature. Or vice versa. Because entropy is a state function, the path doesn't matter, so either way should give the same result.

So, let's try that. Let's first change the temperature from T1 to T2 at constant pressure P1, then change the pressure from P1 to P2 at constant temperature T2.

So, the first step: heating at constant pressure P1 (which is 1.00 atm). The entropy change for this step is ΔS1 = n Cp ln(T2/T1).

The second step: changing the pressure at constant temperature T2. The entropy change for this step is ΔS2 = -n R ln(P2/P1). The negative sign because increasing pressure decreases entropy.

Then, total ΔS = ΔS1 + ΔS2.

Wait, why negative? Because when pressure increases, the volume decreases, and for an ideal gas, higher pressure means lower entropy when temperature is constant. So yes, ΔS2 is negative.

Alternatively, another formula I found is ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1) - n R ln(P2/P1). So that's the same as what I just thought.

Let me write down the values.

n = 3.00 mol

Cp,m = (5/2) R. So, Cp = (5/2) R per mole.

T1 = 25°C = 298.15 K (since 25 + 273.15 = 298.15)

T2 = 125°C = 398.15 K

P1 = 1.00 atm

P2 = 5.00 atm

R is the gas constant, which is 8.314 J/(mol·K), I think. Or wait, sometimes R is given as 8.314 J/(mol·K), but sometimes in other units. Oh well, in this case, since all units are in SI, I'll use R = 8.314 J/(mol·K).

So, let's compute each part.

First, calculate T2/T1:

T2/T1 = 398.15 / 298.15 ≈ Let me compute that. 398.15 ÷ 298.15. Let me do the division:

Well, 298.15 * 1.333 is about 397.53, which is close to 398.15. So approximately 1.334.

Wait, precise calculation: 298.15 * 1.333333 = 298.15 * 1.333333 ≈ 298.15 * 4/3 ≈ 397.53. So 398.15 is a bit higher, so maybe 1.334.

So ln(1.334) ≈ Let's compute that. I know that ln(1.3333) is ln(4/3) ≈ 0.28768207. So 1.334 is slightly higher than 4/3, so ln(1.334) would be a bit higher, maybe around 0.290.

But perhaps I should just use a calculator approach. Alternatively, I can compute it more accurately.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute it exactly. Let me compute 398.15 / 298.15.

398.15 ÷ 298.15 ≈ Let me compute:

298.15 * 1.333 is 298.15 * 1 = 298.15; 298.15 * 0.3 = 89.445; 298.15 * 0.03 = 8.9445; 298.15 * 0.003 = 0.89445. So 1.333 times 298.15 is 298.15 + 89.445 = 387.595 + 8.9445 = 396.5395 + 0.89445 ≈ 397.43395. So 1.333 * 298.15 ≈ 397.434. But our T2 is 398.15, which is 0.716 higher. So 398.15 - 397.434 = 0.716. So 0.716 / 298.15 ≈ 0.0024. So total ratio is approximately 1.333 + 0.0024 = 1.3354.

So ln(1.3354) ≈ Let's use a Taylor expansion around ln(1.3333)=0.28768. The difference is 1.3354 - 1.3333 = 0.0021. So using the approximation ln(1+x) ≈ x - x²/2 + x³/3 - ... for small x. So x=0.0021.

So ln(1.3354) ≈ ln(1.3333) + (0.0021) - (0.0021)^2 / 2 ≈ 0.28768 + 0.0021 - 0.00000221 ≈ 0.289778.

Alternatively, perhaps I can just use a calculator. But perhaps it's easier to just compute it as:

ln(398.15/298.15) = ln(398.15) - ln(298.15).

Let me compute ln(398.15):

I know that ln(300) is about 5.70378. 398.15 is 300 * 1.32717. So ln(398.15) = ln(300) + ln(1.32717). ln(1.32717) is approximately 0.283 (since e^0.283 ≈ 1.327). So ln(398.15) ≈ 5.70378 + 0.283 ≈ 5.9868.

ln(298.15) is ln(273.15 + 25) = ln(273.15) is about 5.612 (since e^5.612 ≈ 273), but wait, that's not right. Wait, e^5.612 is approximately e^5 is 148.413, e^5.6 is about 266, e^5.612 is about 273. So ln(298.15) is a bit higher. 298.15 is about 273 * 1.092. So ln(298.15) = ln(273.15) + ln(1.092) ≈ 5.612 + 0.088 ≈ 5.700.

So ln(398.15/298.15) ≈ 5.9868 - 5.700 = 0.2868.

Hmm, that's about 0.2868. Maybe I should just use that as ln(T2/T1).

Now, Cp is (5/2) R, so Cp = (5/2) * 8.314 J/(mol·K) = (5 * 8.314)/2 ≈ (41.57)/2 ≈ 20.785 J/(mol·K).

So, ΔS1 = n * Cp * ln(T2/T1) = 3.00 mol * 20.785 J/(mol·K) * 0.2868 ≈ Let's compute that.

First, 3 * 20.785 = 62.355. Then multiply by 0.2868.

62.355 * 0.2868 ≈ Let's compute:

62.355 * 0.2 = 12.471

62.355 * 0.08 = 4.9884

62.355 * 0.0068 ≈ 0.423.

Adding up: 12.471 + 4.9884 = 17.4594 + 0.423 ≈ 17.8824 J/K.

So ΔS1 ≈ 17.88 J/K.

Next, ΔS2 is the entropy change when pressure changes from 1.00 atm to 5.00 atm at constant temperature T2. The formula for entropy change when temperature is constant is ΔS = -n R ln(P2/P1).

Wait, because when you increase pressure, entropy decreases, so it's negative.

So P2/P1 = 5.00 / 1.00 = 5.00.

ln(5) is approximately 1.6094.

So ΔS2 = -3.00 mol * 8.314 J/(mol·K) * ln(5) ≈ -3 * 8.314 * 1.6094.

Compute that:

3 * 8.314 ≈ 24.942.

24.942 * 1.6094 ≈ Let me compute:

24.942 * 1.6 = 39.9072

24.942 * 0.0094 ≈ 0.2348

So total ≈ 39.9072 + 0.2348 ≈ 40.142.

So ΔS2 ≈ -40.142 J/K.

So total ΔS = ΔS1 + ΔS2 = 17.88 J/K - 40.142 J/K ≈ -22.26 J/K.

Wait, looking at the options, option H is -22.1 J/K, which is very close. So I think that's the answer.

Now, to rationalize the sign. The entropy change is negative, which means the system's entropy decreased. Why?

Well, the entropy change comes from two parts: heating the gas (which increases entropy) and increasing the pressure (which decreases entropy). The entropy lost due to the pressure increase is larger than the entropy gained from heating, so overall entropy decreases.

Alternatively, when you go from lower temperature and lower pressure to higher temperature and higher pressure, the effect of higher pressure on entropy (which is more significant because entropy is more sensitive to pressure changes at constant temperature) outweighs the entropy gain from heating. So the net change is negative.
</think>

To calculate the entropy change (ΔS) for the system when the state of 3.00 moles of a perfect gas is changed from 25°C and 1.00 atm to 125°C and 5.00 atm, we use the formula for entropy change of an ideal gas:

\[
\Delta S = n C_{p} \ln\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right) - n R \ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)
\]

### Given Data:
- \( n = 3.00 \, \text{mol} \)
- \( C_{p,m} = \frac{5}{2} R \)
- \( T_1 = 25^\circ \text{C} = 298.15 \, \text{K} \)
- \( T_2 = 125^\circ \text{C} = 398.15 \, \text{K} \)
- \( P_1 = 1.00 \, \text{atm} \)
- \( P_2 = 5.00 \, \text{atm} \)
- \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \)

### Step 1: Calculate \( \ln(T_2 / T_1) \)
\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{398.15}{298.15} \approx 1.335
\]
\[
\ln(1.335) \approx 0.2868
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \ln(P_2 / P_1) \)
\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{5.00}{1.00} = 5.00
\]
\[
\ln(5.00) \approx 1.6094
\]

### Step 3: Substitute values into the formula
\[
C_p = \frac{5}{2} R = \frac{5}{2} \times 8.314 = 20.785 \, \text{J/(mol·K)}
\]
\[
\Delta S = n C_p \ln\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right) - n R \ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)
\]
\[
\Delta S = 3.00 \times 20.785 \times 0.2868 - 3.00 \times 8.314 \times 1.6094
\]

### Step 4: Compute each term
1. \( 3.00 \times 20.785 \times 0.2868 \approx 17.88 \, \text{J/K} \)
2. \( 3.00 \times 8.314 \times 1.6094 \approx 40.14 \, \text{J/K} \)

\[
\Delta S = 17.88 - 40.14 = -22.26 \, \text{J/K}
\]

### Rationalization of the Sign
The entropy change is negative, indicating a net decrease in the system's entropy. This occurs because the entropy lost due to the increase in pressure (which significantly decreases entropy at constant temperature) outweighs the entropy gained from heating the gas.

### Final Answer:
The entropy change for the system is approximately **-22.26 J/K**, which corresponds to option **H**.

H: -22.1$\mathrm{J} \mathrm{K}^{-1}$
