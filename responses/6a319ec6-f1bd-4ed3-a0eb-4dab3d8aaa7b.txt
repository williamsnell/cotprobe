Okay, so I've got this economics question here about marginal revenue and marginal cost. I'm trying to remember what I learned in my microeconomics class. Let me think this through step by step.

The question is asking where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. I remember that marginal revenue (MR) is the additional revenue a firm gets from selling one more unit, and marginal cost (MC) is the additional cost from producing one more unit. 

In the context of profit maximization, I think firms aim to produce the quantity where MR equals MC. That's because beyond that point, producing more units would cost more than it earns, so profits would start to decrease. So, when MR = MC, the firm is maximizing its profit.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Total product is at its highest point. Wait, total product is like total output, which is the production function. I think the highest point of total product is where marginal product (MP) is zero, which is after the peak of MP. But the point where MR=MC isn't necessarily where total product is maximum. It's more about the profit point, not production.

B: Average product is at its highest point. Average product (AP) is total product divided by inputs. The maximum AP occurs where MP is zero, but again, that's not directly related to MR=MC. The firm's decision is based on costs and revenues, not just AP.

C: Total revenue is at its maximum, irrespective of total cost. Hmm, total revenue is maximized when MR is zero, because beyond that point, selling more units doesn't add to revenue. But MR=MC is about maximizing profit, which might not be at the same point as maximum revenue. Profit is when total revenue minus total cost is maximized, so this option doesn't sound right.

D: Total revenue is less than total cost. That would mean the firm is making a loss. But MR=MC could be at a point where profit is positive or zero. Not sure if this is correct.

E: Marginal product is at its highest point. The highest MP is where AP is maximum, which is the point where TP is increasing at the fastest rate. But again, that's about production efficiency, not about revenue and cost.

F: Average revenue equals average cost. Average revenue is AR, which is total revenue over quantity, same as price. Average cost is total cost over quantity. So this would be the break-even point where profit is zero. But the profit-maximizing point is where MR=MC, not necessarily where AR=AC. So F might not be the right answer.

G: Fixed cost is at its lowest point. Fixed costs are constant, so they don't change with output. So this doesn't make sense in this context.

H: Total revenue is equal to total cost. That's the break-even point again, where profits are zero. But profit maximization isn't necessarily at the break-even point; it's where MR=MC, which could be above or below that point depending on the firm's situation.

I: Total revenue is greater than total cost at its greatest distance. I'm not sure what this means. Greatest distance from what? Maybe the maximum difference between TR and TC, but I don't think that's the standard point. It might refer to maximum profit, which would be where MR=MC, but the wording is unclear.

J: Variable cost is at its lowest point. Variable costs change with output, and the lowest point would be zero, but producing zero units isn't the point where MR=MC. Instead, it's about where the firm should produce to maximize profit.

Wait, I think I might have gotten confused with some of the options. Let me go back. The correct point where MR=MC is the profit-maximizing output. So looking at the options again, none of them directly say "profit is maximized," but perhaps H or C? No, H is TR=TC, which is break-even, not necessarily profit max.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question is phrased as "the point where MR=MC." So that point is where profit is maximized. But looking at the options, none of them directly state that. So perhaps the closest is option H, but that's when TR=TC, which is a different point.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is H, but I'm not certain. Wait, no, when MR=MC, the firm could be making a profit (if TR>TC) or a loss (if TR<TC). So H is specifically when TR=TC, but the point where MR=MC could be at a profit or loss. So the correct answer isn't necessarily H.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. The point where MR=MC is where the firm's profit is maximized. So in terms of the options, which one aligns with that.

Looking at the options again:

C: Total revenue is at its maximum... No, because that's when MR=0, not necessarily MR=MC.

H: TR=TC. That's the break-even point, which is when profit is zero. But the profit-maximizing point is where MR=MC, which could be at a higher TR than TC (if making profit) or lower (if making a loss but still optimal). So H isn't necessarily the point where MR=MC.

Wait, perhaps none of the options directly state this, but the correct answer is H because it's the point where profit is zero, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is H because it's the point where TR=TC, but that's not the same as MR=MC.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to recall: The profit-maximizing quantity is where MR=MC. At that point, the firm's profit is maximized, which could be positive or negative depending on the industry. So looking at the options, the correct answer is likely H, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing profit maximization with the shutdown point. The shutdown point is where MR=AVC, not MC. So the shutdown point is when TR=VC, which is option D. But the profit-maximizing point is when MR=MC, which could be a point where TR>TC (if making profit) or TR<TC (if loss is minimized).

So perhaps none of the options directly address this, but the closest is H, where TR=TC. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is H because that's where profit is zero, and the point where MR=MC could be at a higher or lower quantity, depending on the firm's situation.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. The standard answer is that MR=MC is the point where profit is maximized, which isn't directly listed. But looking at the options, perhaps option H is the correct one because it's the point where TR equals TC, which could be a point of zero profit, but that's not necessarily the same as where MR=MC.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H: total revenue is equal to total cost. Because that's the point where profit is zero, but that's not where profit is maximized. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is H because when TR equals TC, that's the break-even point, which is when MR=MC if the firm is producing at that point. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should think of a graph. On a profit graph, the maximum profit occurs where MR=MC. So on the TR and TC curves, the vertical difference is profit. The maximum point is where the slope of TR (MR) equals the slope of TC (MC). So the point where MR=MC is where the vertical distance between TR and TC is the greatest, which would be the maximum profit point.

Wait, looking back at the options, I don't see that. Option I says "total revenue is greater than total cost at its greatest distance." That might be referring to the maximum profit point, where TR is as far above TC as possible. So option I could be correct.

Wait, option I says: total revenue is greater than total cost at its greatest distance. So that would be the point where TR is as much higher than TC as possible, which is the maximum profit point. And that occurs when MR=MC. So I think option I is the correct answer.

Wait, but let me check. If TR is greater than TC, that's a profit. The greatest distance would be the maximum profit. So when MR=MC, profit is maximized, which is when TR is as much higher than TC as possible. So yes, option I seems correct.

The question asks where marginal revenue equals marginal cost (MR=MC). MR is the additional revenue from selling one more unit, and MC is the additional cost of producing one more unit. The point where MR=MC is where profit is maximized, as producing beyond this point would decrease profits due to costs outweighing revenue.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, E, G, J**: These options focus on production efficiency (e.g., total or average product, marginal product) rather than profit maximization, so they are incorrect.
- **C**: Total revenue is maximized when MR=0, not necessarily where MR=MC, so this is incorrect.
- **D**: Total revenue less than total cost indicates a loss, but MR=MC can occur at any profit or loss point, so this is incorrect.
- **F**: Average revenue equals average cost at the break-even point (zero profit), but MR=MC is about profit maximization, so this is incorrect.
- **H**: Total revenue equals total cost is the break-even point, not necessarily where MR=MC, so this is incorrect.
- **I**: Total revenue is greater than total cost at its greatest distance refers to the maximum profit point, which aligns with MR=MC. This is correct.

Thus, the correct answer is:

I
