Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the total length of a music showcase. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the problem says there are 3 sets that are each 20 minutes long and 1 set that's 40 minutes. So that's 3 times 20 and then plus 40. Let me write that down: 3*20 + 40. That would be 60 + 40, which is 100 minutes for the sets themselves.

But wait, there's more. There are breaks between each set. Each break is 10 minutes long. Now, how many breaks are there? Well, if there are 4 sets in total, the number of breaks would be one less than the number of sets. So that's 3 breaks. Because after the first set, you have a break, then after the second, another break, and after the third, another break before the fourth set. Then after the fourth set, there's no more break because the showcase ends. So 3 breaks at 10 minutes each.

So the total break time is 3*10, which is 30 minutes.

Now, adding the sets and the breaks together: the sets are 100 minutes, and the breaks are 30 minutes, so 100 + 30 equals 130 minutes. So the total length should be 130 minutes.

Wait a second, let me check the way the problem was presented. The user mentioned the formula as 3(20 +10) +40. Let me compute that. 3*(20+10) is 3*30, which is 90. Then plus 40 is 130. So that matches what I calculated earlier. So that must be the right answer. 

Looking at the options, J is 130 minutes. So the answer should be J.

The total length is calculated by adding the durations of the sets and the breaks. There are 3 sets of 20 minutes each and 1 set of 40 minutes, totaling 100 minutes for the sets. With 3 breaks of 10 minutes each, the breaks add 30 minutes. Adding these together gives 130 minutes.

Answer: J
