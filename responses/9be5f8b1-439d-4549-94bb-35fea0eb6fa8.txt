Question:

A company contracted with a builder to construct a new corporate headquarters for a fixed price of $100 million. At the time of the contract, structural steel was widely available and was included in the contract as a $6 million item. Before work began on the project, tornado damage shut down the production facility of the biggest structural steel supplier in the country, and the price of structural steel increased by 20% as a result. The builder informed the company of the steel price increase, and the parties then orally agreed to increase the project price to $101 million. The builder proceeded with construction and delivered the project on time. The company paid the builder $100 million but refused to pay the additional $1 million. If the builder sues the company for $1 million, is the builder likely to prevail?

Options:

A: No, because the price change of structural steel was not significant enough to warrant a contract modification.
B: No, because there was no consideration for the modification of the contract.
C: No, because the modification was never reduced to a writing signed by the party to be charged.
D: No, because the company did not sign a new contract reflecting the price change.
E: Yes, because the modification was fair and equitable in view of the unanticipated increase in the price of structural steel.
F: Yes, because the builder completed the project on time despite the unforeseen circumstances.
G: Yes, because the builder had no control over the price increase of structural steel.
H: Yes, because the company√ïs promise was supported by consideration.
I: Yes, because the company was aware of the price increase and verbally agreed to it.
J: No, because the builder should have anticipated potential price fluctuations in materials.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the builder is likely to prevail in their lawsuit against the company for the additional $1 million. Let me break down the problem step by step.

The scenario is that a company contracted a builder to construct their headquarters for a fixed price of $100 million. Structural steel was a $6 million item at the time of the contract. Then, before work started, a tornado caused significant damage to the biggest steel supplier's production facility. This led to a 20% increase in steel prices. The builder told the company about this and they orally agreed to increase the price to $101 million. The builder finished on time, but the company only paid $100 million and refused the extra million. Now the builder is suing for that $1 million.

I remember that contract law generally requires consideration for any modification to be valid. So, I'm thinking about whether the oral agreement constitutes a binding modification.

The options given are A through J, with some possible reasons why the builder might or might not win.

Let me think about each option:

Option A says no because the price change wasn't significant enough. But 20% on $6 million is $1.2 million, which is part of the $1 million increase. The overall contract went from 100 to 101 million, so it's a 1% increase. But I'm not sure if the significance of the change matters in terms of whether a contract can be modified. I think as long as there's mutual agreement, even a small change can be valid. So maybe A is not the right reason.

Option B says no because there was no consideration. Wait, in contract law, consideration is something of value exchanged. When a contract is modified, both parties must provide new consideration to support the modification. However, under the pre-existing duty rule, a promise to do what you're already obligated to do isn't sufficient consideration. So, if the company agreed to pay more, was that supported by consideration from the builder? The builder agreed to complete the project on time, which they were already supposed to do. So the builder isn't providing new consideration. Similarly, the company isn't getting anything extra because the builder was already under a duty to perform. So the modification might lack consideration, making it unenforceable. This could make B a possible correct answer.

Option C says no because it wasn't in writing. The question is about whether a modification needs to be in writing. Under the Statute of Frauds, certain contracts and modifications must be in writing. But for a construction contract, I think the main contract would need to be in writing, but modifications might not unless the amount exceeds a certain threshold. The additional $1 million is significant, but I'm not sure if that triggers the Statute of Frauds. Even if it did, an oral agreement might still be enforceable if other exceptions apply, like part performance. But since the builder completed the project, maybe that counts as part performance, making the oral agreement enforceable despite not being in writing. So C might not be the right reason.

Option D says no because the company didn't sign a new contract reflecting the change. But an oral agreement can be a valid modification without a new written contract, unless the Statute of Frauds requires it. So D might not be the reason unless the contract's terms required written modifications, which isn't mentioned here. So D could be a possibility, but I'm not sure if it's the main issue.

Option E says yes because the modification was fair and equitable due to the unforeseen price increase. This seems to touch on the concept of impracticability or frustration of purpose, but I think that applies more to when performance becomes impossible or impracticable due to events beyond the parties' control. Here, the price increased, but the builder was still able to perform. So maybe E is referring to the doctrine of frustration or equitable adjustment, but I'm not certain if that's applicable here. I think the main issue is consideration, not whether it's fair.

Option F says yes because the builder finished on time despite unforeseen circumstances. But the builder's timely completion doesn't necessarily affect the enforceability of the modification. The problem is whether the modification was valid, not whether it was beneficial. So F might not be the right reason.

Option G says yes because the builder had no control over the price increase. While true, that doesn't address whether the modification is enforceable. There's no consideration, so even if the builder couldn't control the price, the lack of consideration might still make the modification unenforceable. So G isn't the main issue.

Option H says yes because the company's promise was supported by consideration. But as I thought earlier, the builder's promise to do what they were already required to do doesn't count as consideration. So H might be incorrect because there's no new consideration.

Option I says yes because the company verbally agreed and was aware of the price increase. But again, without consideration, the agreement might not be enforceable. So I could be incorrect.

Option J says no because the builder should have anticipated price fluctuations. But the increase was due to an unforeseen event (tornado damage), which is an external factor. Anticipating such fluctuations is different from foreseeability of specific events. So J might not be the right reason.

Putting it all together, the key issue seems to be whether there was consideration for the modification. Since the builder was already obligated to complete the project on time, their promise to do so doesn't constitute new consideration. Similarly, the company's promise to pay more is what's being sought, but without the builder providing something additional, there's no consideration. Therefore, the modification might not be enforceable, meaning the builder wouldn't prevail.

Looking at the options, B and D are possibilities. But B is about consideration, and D is about a written contract. Since the main issue is consideration, B might be the correct answer. However, some jurisdictions might recognize that a mutual agreement to modify, even without new consideration, can be binding under certain circumstances. But under the traditional pre-existing duty rule, there's no consideration, so the modification isn't enforceable. Therefore, the builder wouldn't prevail because there was no consideration.

The builder is unlikely to prevail because the oral modification lacked consideration. Under contract law, a modification requires new consideration to be enforceable. The builder's promise to complete the project on time was already an obligation under the original contract, so it doesn't count as new consideration. Similarly, the company's promise to pay more doesn't provide consideration for the builder's existing duty. Therefore, the modification is unenforceable.

Answer: B
