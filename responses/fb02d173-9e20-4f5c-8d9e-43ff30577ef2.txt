Question:

When potassium perchlorate, KClO4, dissolves in water, the temperature of the resultant solution is lower than the initial temperature of the components. Which of the following conclusions may be related to this?

Options:

A: This process is non-spontaneous and exothermic.
B: This process is spontaneous because it is endothermic.
C: This is a spontaneous process because of an entropy increase.
D: This is a spontaneous process because it is exothermic.
E: This process is non-spontaneous due to an entropy increase.
F: This is a spontaneous process because of an entropy decrease.
G: This is a non-spontaneous process because it is endothermic.
H: The process is spontaneous and doesn't involve any heat exchange.
I: This is a non-spontaneous process due to an entropy decrease.

Okay, so I have this chemistry question here about potassium perchlorate dissolving in water and the temperature change. The question is asking which conclusion is related to the fact that the resultant solution's temperature is lower than the initial temperature. Hmm, I remember that when a substance dissolves and the solution gets colder, it's an exothermic process because heat is released. Right, exothermic processes release heat into the surroundings.

Wait, but wait. I think I should think about the dissolution process. So, when a salt dissolves, it can either absorb or release heat. If the solution gets colder, that means the process is exothermic because the dissolution is releasing heat into the water, causing it to cool down. So, the dissolution of KClO4 is exothermic.

Now, the question is about whether the process is spontaneous. I remember that Gibbs free energy determines spontaneity. The formula is ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. If ΔG is negative, the process is spontaneous.

Exothermic reactions have negative ΔH. So, if ΔH is negative, that's one factor favoring spontaneity. But what about entropy? If the entropy change (ΔS) is positive, that's also favorable. But sometimes, even if entropy decreases, if the enthalpy term is negative enough, the overall ΔG can still be negative, making the process spontaneous.

Wait, in this case, when KClO4 dissolves, does the entropy increase or decrease? Dissolving a solid into an aqueous solution usually increases entropy because you're going from a solid (ordered) to ions in solution (more disordered). So, ΔS is positive. That's good for spontaneity.

So, the process is exothermic (ΔH negative) and entropy increases (ΔS positive). Both factors contribute to a negative ΔG, making the process spontaneous.

Looking at the options now:

Option D says, "This is a spontaneous process because it is exothermic." Well, being exothermic does contribute, but the entropy also increases. So, D is correct because exothermicity alone is enough to make the process spontaneous if the entropy change is positive as well. But wait, another option might also be correct.

Option C says, "This is a spontaneous process because of an entropy increase." That's also correct. So now I'm a bit confused. The question is which conclusion may be related. So, both D and C are correct in their own ways.

Wait, but the question is about the temperature change. The process is exothermic because it releases heat, making the solution colder. So, the exothermic part is directly linked to the temperature drop.

But the spontaneity comes from both enthalpy and entropy. So, maybe the correct conclusion is that it's spontaneous because it's exothermic (option D) or because entropy increases (option C). But the question is, which conclusion is related to the temperature being lower. Since the temperature is lower, it's exothermic. So, the conclusion that it's exothermic and thus spontaneous (option D) would be correct.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: sometimes dissolving can be endothermic but still spontaneous if entropy increases enough. For example, ammonium nitrate dissolving in water is endothermic (solution gets hot), but if the entropy change is positive, ΔG could still be negative, making it spontaneous despite being endothermic. But wait, in that case, the solution gets hotter, which is endothermic.

In our case, the solution is colder, so the process is exothermic. So, exothermic processes are more likely to be spontaneous because they release energy, but it's not the only factor. So, the correct conclusion is that the process is spontaneous because it's exothermic (option D) or because entropy increased (option C). But the question is about the temperature change, so the exothermic part is more directly related.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is D. Because the exothermic nature is directly causing the temperature drop, so the process is spontaneous because it's exothermic. But wait, I also remember that when a process is spontaneous, it doesn't necessarily mean it happens quickly. It just means it's thermodynamically favorable.

Wait, but another angle: the solution getting colder means heat is released. So the dissolution process is exothermic, which aligns with option D. So, I think the correct answer is D.

When potassium perchlorate (KClO₄) dissolves in water and the solution's temperature decreases, this indicates that the process is exothermic, as heat is released into the surroundings. Exothermic processes (ΔH < 0) contribute to spontaneity, as described by the Gibbs free energy equation, ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. In this case, the dissolution also likely increases entropy (ΔS > 0), further favoring spontaneity. However, the temperature change directly points to the exothermic nature of the process, making the conclusion that the process is spontaneous because it is exothermic the most relevant.

Answer: D
