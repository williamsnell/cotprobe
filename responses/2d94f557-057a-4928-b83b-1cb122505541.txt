Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that an observer S lives on the x-axis and sees a flash of red light at x = 1210 meters. Then, after 4.96 microseconds, there's a flash of blue light at x = 480 meters. I'm supposed to find the measured time interval between these two flashes. The options are given from A to J, so I need to calculate the time and pick the correct letter.

Wait, wait. The problem mentions using subscripts R and B to label the coordinates. So the red flash is event R at (x_R, t_R) and the blue is event B at (x_B, t_B). But I don't think the subscripts affect the time calculation directly; maybe it's just for clarity.

So, the observer S is on the x-axis. Hmm, in special relativity, when dealing with events observed in different frames, we often use the Lorentz transformation. But wait, the observer is on the x-axis, and the events happen at two different points on the same axis. So maybe S is in the rest frame, and we need to calculate the time between the two events as measured in S's frame.

Wait a second, but the problem seems a bit straightforward. The first event is at x=1210 m, and the second at x=480 m. The time between the two events as observed by S is given as 4.96 µs. But that's the time between when S saw the red and then the blue. But wait, no, the problem says that the red flash occurs at x=1210, and then after 4.96 µs, the blue at x=480. So from S's perspective, the blue flash happens 4.96 µs after the red. But wait, that's just the time difference in S's frame, right? So why is the question asking for the measured time interval? Because that's already given as 4.96 µs, which is option F.

Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the problem is implying that the two events are happening in different inertial frames, and I'm supposed to calculate the time interval in S's frame, but considering that the events are simultaneous in another frame. Or maybe it's a trick question where the time is just 4.96 µs, so the answer is F.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about simultaneity and time dilation. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem states that S is on the x-axis and observes the two flashes. So S is the rest frame, perhaps. The red flash is at x=1210 m, and the blue at x=480 m. The time between the two events as measured by S is 4.96 µs. But wait, the question is asking what is the measured time interval between the flashes. So if S measures 4.96 µs, then the answer is F. But that seems too simple. Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is implying that these events are simultaneous in another frame, and we need to find the time interval in S's frame. Let me think about that.

In special relativity, two events that are simultaneous in one frame may not be in another. Suppose another observer is moving relative to S, and for them, the two flashes happen at the same time. Then, in S's frame, there would be a time difference. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. The problem doesn't mention another frame, just the observer S. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, the problem says the observer S sees the red flash first, then 4.96 µs later, the blue. So S measures the time between them as 4.96 µs. So the answer should be F, 4.96.

But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. Let me check the problem again: "An observer S who lives on the x-axis sees a flash of red light at x = 1210 m, then after 4.96 µs, a flash of blue at x = 480 m." So the time between the two events as measured by S is 4.96 µs. Therefore, the measured time interval is 4.96 µs, which is option F.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in the context of another frame, but the question is unclear. Alternatively, maybe the problem is about calculating the time interval using the Lorentz transformations, but that would require knowing the relative velocity between frames, which isn't provided here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the time it takes for the light to reach the observer, but that doesn't make sense because the observer is at a certain point on the x-axis, but the events are at two different x positions. Wait, no, because the observer S is on the x-axis, and the events are located at x=1210 and x=480 m. So perhaps the time measured by S is the time between the arrival of the red and blue light at S's position, but that would complicate things.

Wait, no, the problem says S sees the red flash at x=1210 m, and then after 4.96 µs, the blue at x=480 m. So S is not at the origin but at some point on the x-axis. Wait, no, the observer's position isn't specified, but the events are at x=1210 and x=480. So perhaps the observer is at a different point, and the time it takes for the light to reach them is what's being considered.

Wait, that's a possibility. Let me think about that. Suppose S is at a certain point on the x-axis, say at x = x_S. The red flash occurs at x=1210 m, and the blue at x=480 m. The time between the two events as measured by S is 4.96 µs. So the time it takes for the red light to reach S after the flash, and the time for the blue to reach S after its flash, but the difference between these two arrival times is 4.96 µs.

But wait, the problem doesn't state where S is located. It just says S is on the x-axis. Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the events are happening at two points on the x-axis, and S is somewhere else on the x-axis, and we need to calculate the time between the arrival of the two flashes at S's location.

Wait, but the problem states that S sees the red flash at x=1210 m, which implies that S is at that point when the red flash occurs. Wait no, that doesn't make sense. S is an observer, so they can see events happening at different locations. So when the red flash occurs at x=1210 m, S, who is at some point on the x-axis, sees it. Then, 4.96 µs later, S sees the blue flash at x=480 m. So the time between the two events as measured by S is 4.96 µs, which is the time between the two flashes arriving at S's position.

Wait, but that's the time between the two events as observed by S, so the answer is 4.96 µs, option F.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem says S sees the red at x=1210, then after 4.96 µs sees the blue at x=480. So the time interval as measured by S is 4.96 µs. So the answer is F.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about calculating the time it would take for the light to travel from each event's position to S's position, but without knowing where S is, that's impossible.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify where S is located on the x-axis. So perhaps S is at the origin, x=0. Then, the time it takes for the red flash at x=1210 m to reach S is t_red = 1210 m / (speed of light). Similarly, the blue flash at x=480 m would take t_blue = 480 m / c. But then the time between the two events as observed by S would be the difference between these two times, but that's not necessarily 4.96 µs.

Wait, but the problem says S sees the red flash at x=1210 m, then after 4.96 µs, the blue at x=480 m. So perhaps the time between the two events as observed by S is 4.96 µs, regardless of where S is. So the answer is F.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the proper time, but I'm not sure. Without more information, I think the most straightforward answer is that the time interval measured by S is 4.96 µs, so the answer is F.
</think>

The problem involves an observer S on the x-axis who sees a red flash at x = 1210 m, followed by a blue flash at x = 480 m after 4.96 µs. The question asks for the measured time interval between these flashes as observed by S.

Since S is the observer, the time interval between the two events is directly given as 4.96 µs. There is no additional information suggesting relativistic effects or the need for further calculations. Therefore, the measured time interval is 4.96 µs.

Answer: F
