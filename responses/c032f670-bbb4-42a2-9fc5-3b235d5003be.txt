Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the sum of the roots of the equation x³ - 2x + 2 = 0 using Graeffe's root squaring method. The options given are A through J. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on Graeffe's method, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that Graeffe's method is used to find the roots of a polynomial, especially when we need to apply transformations to the polynomial's coefficients to make the roots approach each other or to find sums of powers of the roots. But wait, the sum of the roots is actually given by Vieta's formula, right? For a cubic equation x³ + a x² + b x + c = 0, the sum of the roots is -a. In this case, the equation is x³ - 2x + 2 = 0, which can be written as x³ + 0x² - 2x + 2 = 0. So according to Vieta, the sum should be -0, which is 0. But wait, the options have H as 0, so maybe the answer is H.

But the question specifically asks to apply Graeffe's method. Maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think again. Graeffe's method is more about transforming the coefficients so that each new coefficient is a sum of powers of the roots, which can help in finding the roots iteratively. But since the sum is directly given by Vieta, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, perhaps I should just go through the steps to be sure. Let me try to apply Graeffe's method.

Graeffe's method involves creating a new polynomial whose roots are related by squaring or other operations. For a cubic, the process might involve a few steps. The idea is to eliminate one root at a time by transforming the coefficients.

Let me denote the roots as r1, r2, r3. The original equation is x³ + 0x² -2x +2 = 0.

In Graeffe's method, we can create a new set of coefficients by using the sums of the squares of the roots, etc. But perhaps it's easier to use the method to find the roots and then sum them. Alternatively, since the sum is known, maybe Graeffe's method isn't necessary here, but the problem requires it.

Alternatively, maybe the question is a bit of a trick because the sum is directly given by Vieta, so the answer is 0, which is option H.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me recall Vieta's formula. For a cubic equation ax³ + bx² + cx + d = 0, the sum of roots is -b/a. Here, a=1, b=0, so sum is 0. So the sum should be 0, which is option H.

But the question says to apply Graeffe's method, so perhaps I should go through the steps to find the roots and then sum them, but that would be time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question, and it's just asking for the sum regardless of the method.

Alternatively, perhaps Graeffe's method is used to find the sum indirectly, but I think the sum is straightforward via Vieta.

So I think the answer is H, 0.

The sum of the roots of the equation \( x^3 - 2x + 2 = 0 \) can be directly found using Vieta's formulas. For a cubic equation \( x^3 + a x^2 + b x + c = 0 \), the sum of the roots is \( -a \). In this case, \( a = 0 \), so the sum is \( 0 \).

Answer: H
