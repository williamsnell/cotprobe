Okay, so I have this question about calculating the fatigue strength of a steel shaft. Hmm, I remember that fatigue strength is related to how a material withstands cyclic loading without failing. The question gives me the tensile strength and the endurance limit, and I need to find the fatigue strength for 80,000 cycles.

Wait, what's the difference between tensile strength and endurance limit again? Oh right, the tensile strength is the maximum stress a material can withstand before breaking under a static load, but fatigue strength is about repeated loads. The endurance limit is the maximum stress a material can endure for a certain number of cycles without failing due to fatigue.

The problem says the tensile strength is 390 MPa, and the endurance limit is 115 MPa. I think the endurance limit is usually given for a specific number of cycles, often around 10^7 or 10^8 cycles. But here, the shaft needs to sustain 80,000 cycles, which is much less than 10^7. So maybe the formula I need uses a correction factor based on the number of cycles.

I remember there's a Goodman or Gerber equation that relates the stress amplitude, tensile strength, and the number of cycles. Or wait, maybe it's using the concept of stress range and the endurance limit. Let me think. The formula I think is something like:

Stress amplitude (S) = (Tensile Strength) * (Endurance Limit)/(Tensile Strength)

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Oh, perhaps it's using the formula where the fatigue strength at a certain number of cycles is calculated using the endurance limit and a correction factor. The formula might be S = (R * S_e) / (N^(1/c)), where R is the ratio, S_e is the endurance limit, N is the number of cycles, and c is a constant. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact formula.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. I think there's a simpler approach. The endurance limit is the stress at which the material can endure an infinite number of cycles without failing. But when the number of cycles is less than that, the allowable stress can be higher. So perhaps the formula is S = S_e * (log(N) / log(N_endurance_limit)). Wait, no, that's not right either.

Wait, another thought: the Goodman equation is used to combine static and dynamic stresses. It states that the sum of the normalized stresses should not exceed 1. The normalized stress is (σ_static / σ_UTS) + (σ_dynamic / σ_UTS) ≤ 1. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here because the problem is about pure fatigue, not a combination of static and cyclic loads.

Maybe I should consider the formula for stress amplitude based on the number of cycles. I think the formula is S = (σ_e) * (N / N_e)^(1/c), where σ_e is the endurance limit, N is the number of cycles, and N_e is the reference number of cycles (like 10^8 or something). But I'm not sure about the exact exponent or the reference number.

Wait, another approach. I recall that for materials, the fatigue limit (endurance limit) is the maximum stress for infinite life. For finite life, the stress can be higher, and it's calculated using the formula:

S = σ_e * (log10(N) - 2) / (log10(N_endurance) - 2)

Wait, that might be the formula. So if σ_e is the endurance limit, and N is the number of cycles, then we calculate S based on that.

Given that, let's plug in the numbers. The endurance limit σ_e is 115 MPa, and N is 80,000 cycles. Wait, but what's N_endurance? I think N_endurance is the number of cycles for which the endurance limit is defined. Usually, it's around 10^8 cycles. Or wait, maybe in this case, the endurance limit is given for a different number of cycles, but the problem states it as 115 MPa, so perhaps it's the standard endurance limit for infinite cycles, so N_e is 10^8.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again. If the endurance limit is 115 MPa, that's for infinite life, so for 80,000 cycles, which is much less than infinite, the allowable stress should be higher than 115 MPa.

Wait, perhaps the formula is S = σ_e * (1 + (log10(N) / log10(N_ref))), where N_ref is a reference number of cycles. Or maybe it's using the inverse.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is S = σ_e * (N^(1/3)) / (N_ref^(1/3)), but I'm not sure about the exact exponent.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up different formulas. Let me try to find a more straightforward approach. I recall that for a given number of cycles, you can use the formula:

σ = σ_e * (N)^(-1/3) * (σ_UTS)^ (2/3)

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's using the relation between the number of cycles and the stress. There's a formula like σ = σ_e * (N/N_ref)^( -1/3 ), where N_ref is the reference number of cycles. So if σ_e is for N_ref = 10^8 cycles, then for N = 80,000, which is 8e4, the exponent would be negative.

Let me try that. Let's assume N_ref is 1e8 cycles. So,

σ = σ_e * (N / N_ref)^( -1/3 )

Wait, no, because as N decreases, the allowable stress should increase. So the formula should give a higher σ when N is smaller than N_ref.

Wait, perhaps the formula is σ = σ_e * (N_ref / N)^(1/3). So when N is smaller than N_ref, σ is higher.

Let me check with N_ref = 1e8 and N = 8e4.

So,

σ = 115 MPa * (1e8 / 8e4)^(1/3)

Calculating 1e8 /8e4 = 1e8 /8e4 = (10^8)/(8*10^4) )= (10^4)/(8) = 12500.

Wait, 1e8 is 100,000,000, 8e4 is 80,000. So 1e8 /8e4 = (100,000,000)/(80,000) = 1,250.

So cube root of 1250. Let me calculate that.

Cube root of 1250: 1250^(1/3). 10^3 is 1000, 10.5^3 is about 1157.6, 10.7^3 is around 1225, 10.8^3 is about 1259.7. So cube root of 1250 is approximately 10.8.

So σ ≈ 115 MPa * 10.8 ≈ 1242 MPa. Wait, that can't be right because the tensile strength is only 390 MPa. So that must be wrong.

Hmm, I think I messed up the formula. Maybe the exponent is negative. Let me try again.

Perhaps the formula is σ = σ_e * (N_ref / N)^( -1/3 )

So σ = 115 * (1e8 /8e4)^( -1/3 )

Which is 115 * (1250)^( -1/3 ) = 115 / (10.8) ≈ 10.65 MPa. That can't be right either because the stress should be higher than the endurance limit for fewer cycles.

Wait, maybe I have the formula reversed. Let me think differently. I found a formula online once that the stress amplitude S for a given number of cycles N is given by:

S = (σ_e) * (N / N_end)^(1/3)

Wait, no, that would give S = 115 * (8e4 / 1e8)^(1/3) = 115 * (0.0008)^(1/3)

The cube root of 0.0008 is 0.0928. So 115 * 0.0928 ≈ 10.65 MPa, which is way too low. That can't be right because the stress should be higher for fewer cycles.

Wait, perhaps it's the other way around. Maybe it's (N_end / N)^(1/3). So:

S = 115 * (1e8 /8e4)^(1/3) = 115 * (1250)^(1/3) ≈ 115 * 10.8 ≈ 1242 MPa. But that's higher than the tensile strength, which is 390 MPa. That can't be possible, so this approach must be wrong.

Hmm, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Another approach: the relationship between stress and number of cycles in fatigue is often described by the power law:

N = A * (σ)^b

Where A and b are constants depending on the material and test conditions. Rearranging for σ:

σ = (N / A)^(1/b)

But without knowing the constants, I can't apply this directly.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler. The endurance limit is 115 MPa, which is the stress for infinite life. For a finite number of cycles, the stress can be higher. The formula I remember is:

σ = σ_end * (1 + (log10(N) - log10(N_ref)) / (log10(N_ref) - log10(N_end)))

Wait, that sounds complicated. Alternatively, another formula I found before is:

σ = σ_end * ( (log10(N) - 2) / (log10(N_ref) - 2) )

Assuming N_ref is 1e8 and σ_end is 115 MPa.

So let's compute:

log10(80,000) = log10(8e4) = log10(8) + 4 ≈ 0.9031 + 4 = 4.9031

log10(1e8) = 8

So,

σ = 115 * (4.9031 - 2) / (8 - 2) = 115 * (2.9031)/6 ≈ 115 * 0.48385 ≈ 55.64 MPa. That's lower than the endurance limit, which doesn't make sense because for fewer cycles, the stress should be higher.

Wait, maybe I have the formula wrong. Another approach: perhaps the formula is:

σ = σ_end * ( (2 + log10(N)) / (2 + log10(N_ref)) )

So for N_ref = 1e8, log10(1e8)=8, so denominator is 2+8=10.

log10(8e4)=4.9031, so numerator is 2 +4.9031=6.9031.

So σ = 115 * (6.9031/10) ≈ 115 * 0.6903 ≈ 79.38 MPa. Still lower than the endurance limit, which is impossible.

I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let me think about the Goodman line. The Goodman equation is:

σ_static / σ_UTS + σ_dynamic / σ_UTS ≤ 1

But in this case, there's no static load, it's purely dynamic, so σ_static = 0. Then the equation becomes σ_dynamic / σ_UTS ≤ 1, which implies σ_dynamic ≤ σ_UTS. But that can't be right because the endurance limit is lower than the tensile strength.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the Goodman line for when there's a static load. Since in this problem, it's purely cyclic, maybe the Gerber equation is more appropriate. The Gerber equation is:

σ_dynamic^3 / σ_UTS^3 + σ_static^3 / σ_UTS^3 ≤ 1

Again, with σ_static = 0, it's σ_dynamic^3 / σ_UTS^3 ≤ 1 → σ_dynamic ≤ σ_UTS. But that doesn't help because the endurance limit is lower than σ_UTS.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question is about finding the fatigue strength for 80,000 cycles. The endurance limit is 115 MPa, which is for infinite cycles. So for 80,000 cycles, which is less than infinite, the allowable stress is higher than 115 MPa. How much higher?

I think there's a formula that relates the two. Let me try this one: the stress is given by σ = σ_end * (1 + (N / N_end)^(1/3)).

Wait, but N_end is the number of cycles for the endurance limit. If N_end is 1e8, then for N=8e4, which is smaller, the factor would be:

1 + (8e4 /1e8)^(1/3) = 1 + (0.0008)^(1/3) ≈ 1 + 0.0928 ≈1.0928.

So σ ≈115 *1.0928 ≈125.6 MPa. But looking at the options, I don't see 125 MPa. The closest option is C:164.8, but that's higher. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the formula is different. Another approach: the number of cycles to failure can be related to the stress using the equation:

N = 4.45e6 * (σ_end / σ)^3

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact constants. Alternatively, I've heard of the formula:

N = (σ_end / σ)^3 * K

Where K is a constant like 4.45e6 or similar.

If I rearrange this to solve for σ:

σ = σ_end / ( (N/K)^(1/3) )

Assuming K=4.45e6, let's compute:

N=8e4, K=4.45e6.

N/K =8e4 /4.45e6 ≈0.01799.

So (N/K)^(1/3)= (0.01799)^(1/3) ≈0.2625.

So σ=115 /0.2625 ≈438 MPa. But that's higher than the tensile strength of 390 MPa, which isn't possible because the fatigue strength can't exceed the tensile strength.

Hmm, that can't be right. Maybe the formula is reversed. Let me try:

σ = σ_end * (N_ref / N)^(1/3)

Assuming N_ref is the reference number of cycles, say 1e8.

So σ=115*(1e8 /8e4)^(1/3)=115*(1250)^(1/3)=115*10.8≈1242 MPa, but again, that's way higher than the tensile strength, which is impossible.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should think differently. Since the endurance limit is 115 MPa for infinite cycles, and we need the stress for 80,000 cycles, which is a finite number but much less than infinite, perhaps we can use a simple approximation where the stress is higher than the endurance limit but less than the tensile strength.

Wait, another approach: the number of cycles to failure at a certain stress can be found using the formula:

N = (σ_end / σ)^3 * C

Where C is a constant that depends on the material and testing conditions. For example, C can be 4.45e6 for steel.

But since we have N=8e4, we can solve for σ:

σ = σ_end * (C / N)^(1/3)

So σ =115 * (4.45e6 /8e4)^(1/3)

Compute 4.45e6 /8e4 = 4450000 /80000 ≈55.625.

Now, cube root of 55.625 is approximately 3.82 (since 3.8^3 ≈54.872, and 3.82^3 ≈55.6).

So σ ≈115 *3.82 ≈439.3 MPa. Again, higher than the tensile strength of 390 MPa, which isn't possible.

Wait, maybe I should use a different constant. Some sources use C= 5e6 or similar. Let me try C=5e6.

Then, 5e6 /8e4=50,000/800=62.5.

Cube root of 62.5≈3.94 (since 3.94^3≈62.5).

So σ=115 *3.94≈452.9 MPa. Still too high.

Hmm, perhaps the formula isn't applicable here, or I'm using the wrong constant. Alternatively, maybe the formula is:

σ = (σ_UTS * σ_end) / sqrt(N)

Wait, let's try that. σ_UTS=390 MPa, σ_end=115 MPa, N=8e4.

So σ=(390*115)/sqrt(8e4)

Compute numerator: 390*115=44,850.

sqrt(8e4)=sqrt(80,000)=282.84.

So σ=44850 /282.84≈158.7 MPa.

Looking at the options, D is 190, C is 164.8, E is 175. So 158.7 is close to option C (164.8) but a bit lower.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is σ = sqrt(σ_UTS * σ_end).

So sqrt(390*115)=sqrt(44850)=211.8 MPa. Hmm, that's not an option either.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the correct approach is to consider the nominal stress for a finite life. The formula I found earlier is:

σ = σ_end * (N / N_ref)^(1/3)

But I think I was using N_ref as 1e8, and the answer comes out way too high, which isn't possible. So perhaps the correct formula is:

σ = σ_end * (N_ref / N)^(1/3)

So let's compute:

σ=115*(1e8/8e4)^(1/3)=115*(1250)^(1/3)=115*10.8≈1242 MPa. Again, too high.

This suggests I'm making a mistake in the formula. Maybe I should look for a different approach entirely.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

σ = (σ_end * N_ref)^(1/3) / (N)^(1/3)

Wait, that's the same as σ_end*(N_ref/N)^(1/3), which brings me back to the same problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

σ = σ_end * (log(N) - log(N_ref)) 

But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the formula is the inverse of the one I used earlier. Let me try:

σ = σ_end / (N / N_ref)^(1/3)

So N_ref=1e8, N=8e4.

N/N_ref=8e4/1e8=0.0008.

Cube root of 0.0008≈0.0928.

So σ=115/0.0928≈1240 MPa. Again, too high.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the options given.

The options are A:210, B:180, C:164.8, D:190, E:175, F:145, G:155, H:150, I:135, J:200.

I think the correct answer is around 164.8 MPa, which is option C. Because when I tried the formula with C=5e6, I got around 452 MPa, which is too high. But maybe the correct formula uses a different constant.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the formula is:

σ = σ_end * ( (N) / N_end )^(1/3)

But that would give a lower σ than σ_end, which isn't right because for fewer cycles, σ should be higher.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

σ = σ_end * (N_end / N )^(1/3)

So σ=115*(1e8/8e4)^(1/3)=115*(1250)^(1/3)=115*10.8≈1242 MPa. Again, too high.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something about how the endurance limit is defined. The endurance limit is the stress level at which the material can endure an infinite number of cycles. For finite cycles, the stress can be higher, and the relationship is often given by the formula:

σ = σ_e * ( (N) / N_e )^(-1/3)

Where N_e is the number of cycles for the endurance limit. Wait, but that would give σ=115*(8e4/1e8)^(-1/3)=115*(0.0008)^(-1/3)=115/(0.0928)=1240 MPa. Again, too high.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should think about the options again. The closest to what I calculated earlier when using the formula σ = sqrt(σ_UTS * σ_end) was around 211 MPa, but that's not an option. However, option A is 210, but that seems too high.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the question expects the endurance limit itself, 115 MPa, but that's not one of the options except for option F, but wait, F is 145. Hmm, no, F is 145, which is higher than 115. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the endurance limit, but that's not the case because the question specifies 80,000 cycles, which is less than infinite, so the stress should be higher than 115 MPa.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of Goodman's equation again. Let me try that.

Goodman equation: σ_a / σ_UTS + σ_m / σ_UTS ≤ 1.

In this case, it's purely cyclic loading, so σ_m (mean stress) is zero, and σ_a is the amplitude. So:

σ_a / 390 ≤ 1 → σ_a ≤390. But that's the tensile strength, which can't be right because the endurance limit is 115, so there's something wrong with this approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing σ_a with the actual stress. Maybe the stress is twice σ_a, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

σ = σ_end * (1 + (N / N_ref)^(1/3))

Assuming N_ref is 1e8, N=8e4.

So:

σ=115*(1 + (8e4/1e8)^(1/3))=115*(1 + (0.0008)^(1/3))=115*(1+0.0928)=115*1.0928≈125.6 MPa.

But that's lower than the endurance limit, which can't be right.

Wait, maybe the formula is the other way around: N = (σ_end / σ)^3 * K.

So rearranged, σ=σ_end / ( (N/K)^(1/3) )

Assuming K=4.45e6, N=8e4.

N/K=8e4/4.45e6≈0.017986.

Cube root of 0.017986≈0.262.

So σ=115/0.262≈439 MPa. Again, higher than tensile strength.

I'm really stuck. Let me think about the options again. The options are A:210, B:180, C:164.8, D:190, E:175, F:145, G:155, H:150, I:135, J:200.

I think the correct approach is to use the formula:

σ = σ_end * (N_ref / N)^(1/3)

But that gives σ=115*(1e8/8e4)^(1/3)=115*10.8≈1242 MPa, which is way too high, so I must be using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

σ = σ_end * (N / N_ref)^(1/3)

Which would give σ=115*(8e4/1e8)^(1/3)=115*(0.0008)^(1/3)=115*0.0928≈10.65 MPa. That's too low, so that can't be right.

I'm really confused. Maybe I should consider that the answer is option C:164.8 MPa because it's the square root of (390 * 115) is approximately 211, which is not an option, but perhaps another approach gives 164.8.

Wait, 164.8 is close to 115 multiplied by 1.433. Hmm, maybe that's the factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

σ = σ_end * ( (N / 1e6) )^(1/3)

So for N=80,000=8e4, which is 0.8e5, so N/1e6=0.08.

Cube root of 0.08≈0.4308.

So σ=115 *0.4308≈49.55 MPa. That's way too low.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe I should just guess based on the options. Since the endurance limit is 115, and the tensile strength is 390, the fatigue strength for 80,000 cycles should be between 115 and 390. Looking at the options, C is 164.8, which is about 42% of the way from 115 to 390. Maybe that's the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

σ = σ_end * ( (N / 1e6) )^(-1/3)

So N=8e4=0.8e5=0.08e6.

So (0.08e6)=8e4.

Wait, (N/1e6)=0.08.

Cube root of 0.08≈0.4308.

So σ=115 /0.4308≈267 MPa. But that's higher than tensile strength, which is impossible.

Wait, I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess. The correct answer is likely option C:164.8 MPa.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the fatigue strength of a steel shaft to sustain 80,000 cycles, given the tensile strength (390 MPa) and the endurance limit (115 MPa). Fatigue strength for a finite number of cycles is typically higher than the endurance limit but lower than the tensile strength. Several formulas were considered, including the Goodman and Gerber equations, as well as power-law relationships, but the exact formula could not be definitively determined. 

The endurance limit of 115 MPa represents the stress for infinite cycles, so for 80,000 cycles, the allowable stress should be higher. Using various approximations and considering the options provided, the most plausible answer aligns with option C: 164.8 MPa, as it falls between the endurance limit and tensile strength and is consistent with the expected range for finite cycles.

**Answer: C**
