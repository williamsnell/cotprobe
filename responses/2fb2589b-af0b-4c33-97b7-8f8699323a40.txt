Okay, so I've got this problem here about water cooling, and I'm a bit rusty on my heat transfer, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that water is used as a cooling agent and is flowing through a pipe. The flow speed is 0.02 m/s, the pipe is 3 meters long, and the diameter is 2.54 cm. The wall temperature is kept at 80°C, and the water enters at 60°C. I need to find the exit temperature.

Hmm, I think this is a convective heat transfer problem. The water is flowing through a pipe, so probably the heat is being transferred from the pipe walls to the water. Since the water is cooler than the walls, it will absorb heat, causing its temperature to rise.

I remember that convective heat transfer can be calculated using Newton's Law of Cooling, which is Q = h * A * (T_wall - T_fluid), where h is the convective heat transfer coefficient. But wait, do I know h here? The problem doesn't give me h directly. Oh, maybe I can calculate it using the Reynolds number and some correlations.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem might be assuming that the heat transfer is negligible or maybe using some other approach. Alternatively, perhaps it's a steady-state flow where we can use the formula for the exit temperature based on the flow rate and heat transfer.

I think I need to find the mass flow rate of the water first. Mass flow rate (m_dot) is density (rho) times velocity (v) times cross-sectional area (A). The velocity is given as 0.02 m/s, and the pipe diameter is 2.54 cm. Let me convert that diameter to meters: 2.54 cm is 0.0254 m. So the radius is half of that, 0.0127 m.

The cross-sectional area A is πr², so A = π*(0.0127)^2. Let me calculate that: 0.0127 squared is approximately 0.00016129. Multiply by π, which is roughly 3.1416, so A ≈ 0.000506 m².

Now, the velocity is 0.02 m/s, so the volume flow rate (V_dot) is V_dot = A * v = 0.000506 m² * 0.02 m/s = 0.00001012 m³/s.

The density of water is about 998 kg/m³ at around room temperature, so m_dot = rho * V_dot = 998 kg/m³ * 0.00001012 m³/s ≈ 0.0101 kg/s.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I need the mass flow rate yet. Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula for the temperature change in a fluid flowing through a pipe with heat transfer. The formula is:

T_exit = T_in + (m_dot * c_p * (T_wall - T_in)) / (h * A)

Where c_p is the specific heat capacity of water, which is about 4180 J/(kg·°C). But wait, this formula assumes that the heat transfer is from the wall to the fluid, and that the fluid's temperature increases linearly along the pipe, which might not be accurate, but maybe it's a simplification.

But wait, I don't know h, the convective heat transfer coefficient. Without h, I can't use this formula directly. So perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the heat transfer is such that the entire pipe's heat is transferred to the water, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate h using the Reynolds number and the Dittus-Boelter equation, which relates h to the flow properties. The Dittus-Boelter equation is for turbulent flow, and I think it's applicable here if the Reynolds number is high enough.

First, let me find the Reynolds number (Re). Re = (v * D) / ν, where ν is the kinematic viscosity of water. At around 60°C, the kinematic viscosity of water is about 0.6501 x 10^-6 m²/s.

So, v is 0.02 m/s, D is 0.0254 m. Re = (0.02 * 0.0254) / 0.6501e-6 ≈ (0.000508) / 0.6501e-6 ≈ 781. So Re ≈ 781. Hmm, that's actually in the laminar flow regime because laminar flow is typically Re < 2300, and turbulent is above that. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Wait, 0.02 m/s * 0.0254 m is 0.000508 m²/s. Divided by 0.6501e-6 m²/s, that's 0.000508 / 0.0000006501 ≈ 781, yeah.

Wait, but 781 is less than 2300, so the flow is laminar. That means the convective heat transfer coefficient h can be found using the formula for laminar flow in a pipe, perhaps the Poiseuille solution, which relates h to the viscosity and flow conditions.

The formula for h in laminar flow is h = (k * (v * D²)) / (32 * L * (T_wall - T_in)), but wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, I think the Nusselt number for laminar flow is a function of Re and the Prandtl number (Pr).

The Nusselt number (Nu) for laminar flow in a pipe is given by Nu = (0.0181 * Re * Pr) / (1 + (0.0181 * Re * Pr)^(1/3)) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, for laminar flow, the Nusselt number is approximately 0.023 * Re^(0.8) for Pr << 1, but I'm not certain. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, for laminar flow, the Nusselt number is simply 1.0, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, that's for the mean temperature gradient.

Wait, perhaps the formula for h in laminar flow is h = ( (k * v * D) ) / ( (2 * L) * ( ( ( ( (v * D)/(2 * ν) )^0.5 ) + 1 ) ) ) ) ). Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look up the formula for h in a laminar flow pipe.

Wait, but since I'm trying to work this out, perhaps I can use the formula for h in laminar flow: h = ( (v * D²) ) / ( (32 * L) * ( (1/(μ)) * ( (T_wall - T_in) ) ) ) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, maybe it's better to use the thermal entry length concept, but perhaps that's complicating things further.

Wait, perhaps I can find h using the formula h = (k * v * D) / ( (2 * L) * ( ( ( (v * D)/(2 * ν) )^0.5 ) + 1 ) ) ), where k is the thermal conductivity of water. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for laminar flow, the heat transfer coefficient h is given by h = ( (k * v * D) ) / ( (2 * L) * ( ( ( (v * D)/(2 * ν) )^0.5 ) + 1 ) ) )

Wait, but I don't have the thermal conductivity k or the viscosity μ of water. Wait, but I can look up the thermal conductivity of water at around 60°C. Water's thermal conductivity is about 0.617 W/(m·K) at 60°C.

The viscosity μ is given by the kinematic viscosity ν multiplied by the density. Since ν is 0.6501e-6 m²/s and density rho is 998 kg/m³, μ = ν * rho = 0.6501e-6 * 998 ≈ 6.476e-4 kg/(m·s).

Wait, let me plug in the numbers. So, let me try to compute h using the formula I think applies to laminar flow. The formula I found in some references is h = ( (k * (v D^2)) ) / (8 * L * ( (T_wall - T_in) )) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the Dittus-Boelter equation, but that's for turbulent flow, which we don't have here since Re is 781, which is laminar.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for h in laminar flow is h = ( (k * v * D) ) / ( (2 * L) * ( ( ( (v * D)/(2 * ν) )^0.5 ) + 1 ) ) )

So, let's compute each part. Let me compute (v * D)/(2 * ν):

v = 0.02 m/s, D = 0.0254 m, ν = 0.6501e-6 m²/s.

v*D = 0.02 * 0.0254 = 0.000508 m²/s.

Divide by 2*ν: 2 * 0.6501e-6 = 1.3002e-6 m²/s.

So (v*D)/(2ν) = 0.000508 / 1.3002e-6 ≈ 390.6.

Take the square root: sqrt(390.6) ≈ 19.76.

So ( (v*D)/(2ν) )^0.5 ≈ 19.76.

Now, the denominator in the formula is 2*L*(19.76 +1) = 2*3*(20.76) = 6*20.76=124.56.

Now, numerator is k*v*D. k is 0.617 W/(m·K), v is 0.02 m/s, D is 0.0254 m.

So numerator = 0.617 * 0.02 * 0.0254 ≈ 0.617 * 0.000508 ≈ 0.0003133 W/(m²·K).

Wait, but h is calculated as numerator divided by denominator: h = (numerator) / (denominator) = 0.0003133 / 124.56 ≈ 2.516e-6 W/(m²·K). That seems way too low. That can't be right because h is usually on the order of tens to hundreds of W/(m²·K).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check again.

Wait, another approach: For laminar flow in a pipe, the average heat transfer coefficient h can be found using:

h = ( (k * Re * Pr) ) / ( (2 * (1 + (Re * Pr)^(1/3)) ) )

Where Re is the Reynolds number and Pr is the Prandtl number.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, for laminar flow, the Nusselt number Nu is given by:

Nu = (Re * Pr) / (1 + (Re * Pr)^(1/3)) )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think. Alternatively, the Nusselt number for laminar flow in a pipe with constant wall temperature is given by:

Nu = (0.0181 * Re * Pr) / (1 + (0.0181 * Re * Pr)^(1/3)) )

Hmm, but I'm not certain. Let me calculate Pr first.

Prandtl number Pr = (c_p * μ) / k.

c_p for water is about 4180 J/(kg·K), μ is 6.476e-4 kg/(m·s), and k is 0.617 W/(m·K).

So Pr = (4180 * 6.476e-4) / 0.617 ≈ (2.720) / 0.617 ≈ 4.407.

Now, Re is 781, as calculated earlier.

So Re * Pr = 781 * 4.407 ≈ 3440.

Now, let's compute the cube root of (Re * Pr): cube root of 3440 ≈ 15.1 (since 15^3=3375, 15.1^3≈3442).

So, the denominator becomes 1 + 15.1 = 16.1.

So, Nu = (0.0181 * 3440) / 16.1 ≈ (62.224) / 16.1 ≈ 3.865.

Now, Nu = h * D / k => h = (Nu * k) / D.

So h = (3.865 * 0.617) / 0.0254 ≈ (2.382) / 0.0254 ≈ 93.8 W/(m²·K).

Hmm, that seems more reasonable. So h ≈ 93.8 W/(m²·K).

Now, with h known, I can calculate the heat transfer. The formula for the temperature at the exit would be:

T_exit = T_in + (m_dot * c_p * (T_wall - T_in)) / (h * A)

Wait, but let me confirm the formula. The heat transferred per unit time is Q = m_dot * c_p * (T_exit - T_in). The heat lost by the wall is Q = h * A * (T_wall - T_exit). Since the wall is hotter than the water, the heat flows into the water.

So, equating the two: m_dot * c_p * (T_exit - T_in) = h * A * (T_wall - T_exit)

Wait, but since T_exit is higher than T_in, and T_wall is higher than T_exit, we can write:

m_dot * c_p * (T_exit - T_in) = h * A * (T_wall - T_exit)

Let me rearrange this equation to solve for T_exit.

Expanding:

m_dot * c_p * T_exit - m_dot * c_p * T_in = h * A * T_wall - h * A * T_exit

Bring all T_exit terms to one side and others to the opposite:

m_dot * c_p * T_exit + h * A * T_exit = m_dot * c_p * T_in + h * A * T_wall

Factor T_exit:

T_exit (m_dot * c_p + h * A) = m_dot * c_p * T_in + h * A * T_wall

So,

T_exit = [m_dot * c_p * T_in + h * A * T_wall] / (m_dot * c_p + h * A)

Now, let's compute each part.

First, compute m_dot. Earlier, I found m_dot ≈ 0.0101 kg/s.

c_p = 4180 J/(kg·K)

T_in = 60°C

h ≈ 93.8 W/(m²·K) = 93.8 J/(s·m²·K)

A is the cross-sectional area, which we found earlier as approximately 0.000506 m².

T_wall = 80°C

Now, let's compute the numerator:

m_dot * c_p * T_in = 0.0101 kg/s * 4180 J/(kg·°C) * 60°C = 0.0101 * 4180 * 60 ≈ 0.0101 * 250800 ≈ 2533.08 J/s

h * A * T_wall = 93.8 J/(s·m²·K) * 0.000506 m² * 80 K ≈ 93.8 * 0.000506 * 80 ≈ 93.8 * 0.04048 ≈ 3.796 J/s

So numerator = 2533.08 + 3.796 ≈ 2536.876 J/s

Now, the denominator:

m_dot * c_p + h * A = 0.0101 * 4180 + 93.8 * 0.000506 ≈ 42.218 + 0.0474 ≈ 42.265 J/s

So T_exit ≈ 2536.876 / 42.265 ≈ 60.03°C? That can't be right because the water should be heating up from 60 to something less than 80.

Wait, that suggests T_exit is almost the same as T_in, which doesn't make sense because the wall is at 80°C and the water is flowing through, so it should absorb heat and rise in temperature.

Wait, I must have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the numbers again.

Wait, let's recalculate h * A * T_wall. h is 93.8 W/(m²·K), which is 93.8 J/(s·m²·K). A is 0.000506 m². T_wall is 80°C, which is 80 K difference.

So, h * A * T_wall = 93.8 * 0.000506 * 80 ≈ 93.8 * 0.04048 ≈ Let me compute 93.8 * 0.04 = 3.752, and 93.8 * 0.00048 = approximately 0.0449. So total ≈ 3.752 + 0.0449 ≈ 3.797 J/s.

m_dot * c_p * T_in = 0.0101 * 4180 * 60. Let's compute 0.0101 * 4180 = 42.218, then 42.218 * 60 = 2533.08 J/s.

So numerator is 2533.08 + 3.797 ≈ 2536.877 J/s.

Denominator: m_dot * c_p = 0.0101 * 4180 ≈ 42.218 J/s. h * A = 93.8 * 0.000506 ≈ 0.0474 J/s.

So denominator is 42.218 + 0.0474 ≈ 42.265 J/s.

So T_exit = 2536.877 / 42.265 ≈ 60.03°C.

Wait, that's impossible because the water is entering at 60°C and the wall is at 80°C, so the exit temperature should be higher than 60. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Let me go back.

Wait, the formula I used for T_exit assumes steady-state conditions and that the heat transfer is from the wall to the water. But perhaps I made a mistake in the formula setup.

Wait, the correct formula for the exit temperature when the wall is at a constant temperature (T_wall) is:

(T_exit - T_wall) = ( (T_in - T_wall) * exp(- (h A)/(rho V c_p) )) )

Wait, no, that's for a lumped capacitance system, which assumes that the temperature is uniform in the fluid. But in this case, the fluid is flowing through a pipe, so it's more of a continuous heat transfer situation.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula for the exit temperature in a pipe with uniform heat flux. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: The heat added to the water is m_dot * c_p * (T_exit - T_in). The heat lost by the wall is h * A * (T_wall - T_exit). Setting them equal:

m_dot * c_p * (T_exit - T_in) = h * A * (T_wall - T_exit)

Rearranging:

m_dot c_p T_exit - m_dot c_p T_in = h A T_wall - h A T_exit

Bring like terms together:

m_dot c_p T_exit + h A T_exit = m_dot c_p T_in + h A T_wall

Factor T_exit:

T_exit (m_dot c_p + h A) = m_dot c_p T_in + h A T_wall

So,

T_exit = (m_dot c_p T_in + h A T_wall) / (m_dot c_p + h A)

Wait, that's the same formula I used earlier, but the result was T_exit ≈ 60.03°C, which is impossible.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the signs. Let me think again: the heat lost by the wall is h*A*(T_wall - T_exit), and the heat gained by the water is m_dot*c_p*(T_exit - T_in). So setting them equal:

m_dot c_p (T_exit - T_in) = h A (T_wall - T_exit)

Expanding:

m_dot c_p T_exit - m_dot c_p T_in = h A T_wall - h A T_exit

Bring T_exit terms to left, others to right:

m_dot c_p T_exit + h A T_exit = m_dot c_p T_in + h A T_wall

So T_exit (m_dot c_p + h A) = m_dot c_p T_in + h A T_wall

So T_exit = [ m_dot c_p T_in + h A T_wall ] / (m_dot c_p + h A )

Plugging in the numbers:

m_dot c_p = 0.0101 kg/s * 4180 J/(kg·K) ≈ 42.218 J/(s·K)

h A = 93.8 W/(m²·K) * 0.000506 m² ≈ 0.0474 J/(s·K)

So denominator = 42.218 + 0.0474 ≈ 42.265 J/(s·K)

Numerator: m_dot c_p T_in = 42.218 * 60 ≈ 2533.08 J/s

h A T_wall = 0.0474 * 80 ≈ 3.792 J/s

So numerator = 2533.08 + 3.792 ≈ 2536.87 J/s

Thus, T_exit = 2536.87 / 42.265 ≈ 60.03°C

Wait, that can't be right because if the water is flowing through a heated pipe, the exit temperature should be higher than the inlet. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating h.

Wait, maybe the calculation of h was wrong. Let me go back to that step.

Earlier, I calculated Re = 781, which is laminar flow. Then I used the Dittus-Boelter equation, which is for turbulent flow, but that might not be applicable here. Using that approach, I got h ≈ 93.8 W/(m²·K). But perhaps for laminar flow, the correct h is different.

Wait, another approach for laminar flow: the convective heat transfer coefficient h is given by h = (k * v * D) / ( (2 * L) * ( ( ( (v D)/(2 ν) )^0.5 ) + 1 ) )

Let me compute that again.

v = 0.02 m/s, D = 0.0254 m, ν = 0.6501e-6 m²/s.

v D = 0.02 * 0.0254 = 0.000508 m²/s.

v D / (2 ν) = 0.000508 / (2 * 0.6501e-6) ≈ 0.000508 / 0.0000013002 ≈ 390.6.

sqrt(390.6) ≈ 19.76.

So, denominator term: (19.76 + 1) = 20.76.

Now, numerator: k * v * D = 0.617 * 0.02 * 0.0254 ≈ 0.617 * 0.000508 ≈ 0.0003133 W/(m·K) * m/s * m = W/(m·K) * m²/s → W/(m·K) * m²/s is equivalent to W/(m·K) * (m²/s) → but I think the units are getting a bit confusing. Let me proceed numerically.

So, h = (0.617 * 0.02 * 0.0254) / (2 * 3 * 20.76)

Compute numerator: 0.617 * 0.02 = 0.01234; 0.01234 * 0.0254 ≈ 0.0003133 W/(m²·K).

Denominator: 2 * 3 = 6; 6 * 20.76 ≈ 124.56.

So h ≈ 0.0003133 / 124.56 ≈ 2.516e-6 W/(m²·K). That's way too low. That can't be right. So perhaps this formula isn't applicable or I'm using it incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps I should use a different formula for h in laminar flow. Another approach is to use the formula for h in laminar flow where h = (k * v * D^2) / (32 * L * (T_wall - T_in)), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps this is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I should look for an alternative formula. I think the correct formula for h in laminar flow is h = (k * v * D) / ( (32 * L) * ( (T_wall - T_in) / (T_wall - T_in)) ) ), but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the thermal resistance approach.

The thermal resistance of the pipe for convection is R = 1/(h A). Then, the total thermal resistance would be the sum of convection and any other resistances, but perhaps in this case, it's just convection.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try an alternative approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the formula for the exit temperature under constant heat flux, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the use of the formula that assumes unit analysis, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the mass flow rate correctly first. Let me double-check that.

The pipe diameter is 2.54 cm, which is 0.0254 m. Radius r = 0.0127 m.

Cross-sectional area A = π r² = π * (0.0127)^2 ≈ 3.1416 * 0.00016129 ≈ 0.000506 m².

Velocity v = 0.02 m/s.

Volume flow rate V_dot = A * v = 0.000506 * 0.02 ≈ 0.00001012 m³/s.

Density rho of water is 998 kg/m³.

Mass flow rate m_dot = rho * V_dot = 998 * 0.00001012 ≈ 0.0100996 kg/s ≈ 0.0101 kg/s. That seems correct.

Now, the specific heat capacity c_p is 4180 J/(kg·°C).

The length of the pipe is L = 3 m.

The heat transfer can be calculated using the formula Q = m_dot c_p (T_exit - T_in) = h A (T_wall - T_exit).

So, m_dot c_p (T_exit - T_in) = h A (T_wall - T_exit).

Rearranging for T_exit:

m_dot c_p T_exit + h A T_exit = m_dot c_p T_in + h A T_wall

T_exit (m_dot c_p + h A) = m_dot c_p T_in + h A T_wall

So,

T_exit = [m_dot c_p T_in + h A T_wall] / (m_dot c_p + h A)

But earlier, when I calculated h as 93.8 W/(m²·K), the result was T_exit ≈ 60.03°C, which is impossible. So perhaps my h value is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should use a different method to calculate h. Let me try using the formula from the Poiseuille flow for heat transfer.

In laminar flow, the average Nusselt number for constant wall temperature is approximately 3.66 for Re < 2300. Wait, no, that's for the case where the entire pipe is at a uniform temperature, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another resource says that for laminar flow in a pipe with constant wall temperature, the Nusselt number is 3.66 when the fluid is entering at a uniform temperature. But I'm not certain. Let me check.

If that's the case, then Nu = 3.66.

Nu = h D / k => h = (Nu k) / D.

So, h = (3.66 * 0.617) / 0.0254 ≈ (2.255) / 0.0254 ≈ 88.7 W/(m²·K).

Wait, that's a bit different from the earlier 93.8 W/(m²·K) I calculated using the Dittus-Boelter approach, but perhaps it's more accurate since it's specifically for laminar flow.

So, using h = 88.7 W/(m²·K).

Now, let's recalculate T_exit.

h = 88.7 W/(m²·K)

A = 0.000506 m²

m_dot = 0.0101 kg/s

c_p = 4180 J/(kg·°C)

T_in = 60°C

T_wall = 80°C

So,

Numerator: m_dot c_p T_in + h A T_wall

= 0.0101 * 4180 * 60 + 88.7 * 0.000506 * 80

Compute each term:

0.0101 * 4180 = 42.218 J/(s·K)

42.218 * 60 = 2533.08 J/s

88.7 * 0.000506 ≈ 0.0448 J/(s·K)

0.0448 * 80 ≈ 3.584 J/s

So numerator = 2533.08 + 3.584 ≈ 2536.664 J/s

Denominator: m_dot c_p + h A

= 42.218 + (88.7 * 0.000506)

88.7 * 0.000506 ≈ 0.0448 J/(s·K)

So denominator ≈ 42.218 + 0.0448 ≈ 42.2628 J/(s·K)

Thus, T_exit = 2536.664 / 42.2628 ≈ 60.03°C

Wait, that's the same result as before. This suggests that even with a different h, the exit temperature isn't rising, which can't be right.

I must be making a mistake somewhere. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the assumption that the entire heat transfer is from the wall to the fluid is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be solved using the formula for the exit temperature when the fluid is heated in a pipe, and the formula is:

T_exit = T_in + ( (m_dot c_p L) / (k A) ) * (T_wall - T_in)

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is T_exit = T_in + ( (m_dot c_p L) / (U A) ) * (T_wall - T_in), where U is the overall heat transfer coefficient, but I don't have U.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the exit temperature based on the thermal capacity and the heat transfer.

Wait, maybe I should compute the heat capacity rate (C) as C = m_dot c_p, and the thermal resistance (R) as R = (T_wall - T_in) / Q. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the temperature rise as:

ΔT = (h A L) / (m_dot c_p)

But I'm not sure. Let me try that.

h = 88.7 W/(m²·K)

A = 0.000506 m²

L = 3 m

So h A L = 88.7 * 0.000506 * 3 ≈ 88.7 * 0.001518 ≈ 0.1346 W/K.

m_dot c_p = 0.0101 * 4180 ≈ 42.218 W/(K).

So ΔT = (0.1346) / (42.218) * (80 - 60) ≈ (0.003187) * 20 ≈ 0.0637°C.

That's a tiny temperature rise, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps this approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to look for another approach.

Another approach: The heat transfer in a pipe can be modeled using the formula for the outlet temperature when the fluid flows through a heater. The formula is:

T_exit = T_in + ( (h A) / (m_dot c_p) ) * (T_wall - T_in) * (1 - exp( - (m_dot c_p L) / (h A) ))

Wait, but that seems more applicable for a finite length with a temperature gradient. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula:

(T_exit - T_in) = (h A L) / (m_dot c_p) * (T_wall - T_in) * (1 - exp( - (m_dot c_p L)/(h A) )) )

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the formula for the exit temperature in a pipe with constant heat flux, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the Biot number. The Biot number is Bi = (h L)/k, where L is the characteristic length. For a pipe, the characteristic length is sometimes taken as the diameter, but I'm not sure.

L is 3 m, but for a pipe, perhaps the relevant length is the diameter, which is 0.0254 m.

So Bi = (88.7 W/(m²·K) * 0.0254 m) / 0.617 W/(m·K) ≈ (2.255) / 0.617 ≈ 3.65.

Since Bi < 0.1, it's a thin-walled cylinder, and the temperature distribution can be approximated as linear. So, T_exit = T_in + (q * L) / (m_dot c_p), where q is the heat flux per unit length.

Wait, but q is the heat transfer per unit length, which is q = h * (T_wall - T_avg), where T_avg is the average temperature of the fluid.

But this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should use the formula for the exit temperature in a pipe with uniform heat flux.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula:

(T_exit - T_in) = (h A L) / (m_dot c_p) * (T_wall - T_in) / (1 + (h A L)/(m_dot c_p))

But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an alternative formula. I found a formula that says:

T_exit = T_in + (h A L / (m_dot c_p)) * (T_wall - T_in) * (1 - exp(- (m_dot c_p)/(h A)) )

But that seems complex. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the formula:

T_exit = T_in + ( (h A L) / (m_dot c_p) ) * (T_wall - T_in)

Assuming that the exponential term is 1, which would be the case when (m_dot c_p L)/(h A) is large. But let's compute that term.

(m_dot c_p L)/(h A) = (0.0101 * 4180 * 3) / (88.7 * 0.000506) ≈ (126.534) / (0.0448) ≈ 2824.3.

Since this is much greater than 1, the exponential term exp(-2824.3) is practically zero. So,

T_exit ≈ T_in + (h A L)/(m_dot c_p) * (T_wall - T_in)

Compute (h A L)/(m_dot c_p):

h A L = 88.7 * 0.000506 * 3 ≈ 0.1346 W/K

m_dot c_p = 0.0101 * 4180 ≈ 42.218 W/K

So, (h A L)/(m_dot c_p) ≈ 0.1346 / 42.218 ≈ 0.003187

Then,

T_exit ≈ 60 + 0.003187 * (80 - 60) ≈ 60 + 0.003187 * 20 ≈ 60 + 0.0637 ≈ 60.0637°C

That's still about 60.06°C, which is barely higher than T_in. That doesn't make sense because the wall is at 80°C, and the water should absorb heat and rise in temperature.

I'm clearly missing something here. Perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using a different approach, or perhaps I made a mistake in calculating h.

Wait, maybe I should try using the formula for h from the Reynolds number and Prandtl number for laminar flow. Let me try that again.

Earlier, I calculated Re = 781 and Pr ≈ 4.407.

For laminar flow, the Nusselt number Nu can be calculated using:

Nu = (0.023 * Re^(0.8)) * Pr^0.3

Wait, but that's for turbulent flow. For laminar flow, I think the formula is different.

Wait, I found a source that says for laminar flow (Re < 2300), the Nusselt number is given by Nu = 3.66 when the wall is at a constant temperature and the fluid is entering at a uniform temperature. So, let's use that.

So, Nu = 3.66.

Then, h = (Nu * k) / D.

k is 0.617 W/(m·K), D is 0.0254 m.

h = (3.66 * 0.617) / 0.0254 ≈ (2.255) / 0.0254 ≈ 88.7 W/(m²·K), which matches the earlier calculation.

So, using h = 88.7 W/(m²·K), let's try the formula again.

T_exit = [m_dot c_p T_in + h A T_wall] / (m_dot c_p + h A)

Plugging in the numbers:

m_dot c_p = 0.0101 * 4180 ≈ 42.218 J/(s·K)

h A = 88.7 * 0.000506 ≈ 0.0448 J/(s·K)

So denominator = 42.218 + 0.0448 ≈ 42.2628 J/(s·K)

Numerator: m_dot c_p T_in = 42.218 * 60 ≈ 2533.08 J/s

h A T_wall = 0.0448 * 80 ≈ 3.584 J/s

So numerator = 2533.08 + 3.584 ≈ 2536.664 J/s

Thus, T_exit ≈ 2536.664 / 42.2628 ≈ 60.03°C.

This result doesn't make sense because the water should be heating up. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect. Maybe the correct formula for the exit temperature when the wall is at constant temperature is:

T_exit = T_in + ( (h A L) / (m_dot c_p) ) * (T_wall - T_in)

But earlier, that gave me a small temperature rise of about 0.06°C, which is impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore heat transfer and just consider the mass flow rate, which would mean the exit temperature remains at 60°C, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using a different approach, such as neglecting heat transfer and just giving the exit temperature based on some other factor. But that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the exit temperature in a pipe with uniform heat flux. The formula is:

(T_exit - T_in) = (q L) / (m_dot c_p)

Where q is the heat flux, which is q = h (T_wall - T_avg), but T_avg is unknown, so it's difficult to use this formula directly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the formula for the exit temperature in a counterflow heat exchanger, but without more information, that's not applicable.

At this point, I'm stuck. I think I must have made a mistake in calculating h. Let me try to find another way to calculate h.

Wait, perhaps I can use the thermal resistance approach. The thermal resistance R is R = (T_wall - T_exit) / Q.

But Q is the heat transfer rate, which is also Q = m_dot c_p (T_exit - T_in).

So, R = (T_wall - T_exit) / (m_dot c_p (T_exit - T_in))

But R is also equal to 1/(h A).

So,

1/(h A) = (T_wall - T_exit) / (m_dot c_p (T_exit - T_in))

Rearranging,

h A = (m_dot c_p (T_exit - T_in)) / (T_wall - T_exit)

Which brings us back to the earlier equation. So, perhaps I should solve for T_exit numerically.

Let me set up the equation:

m_dot c_p (T_exit - T_in) = h A (T_wall - T_exit)

Plugging in the known values:

0.0101 * 4180 * (T_exit - 60) = 88.7 * 0.000506 * (80 - T_exit)

Compute the constants:

Left side: 0.0101 * 4180 ≈ 42.218, so 42.218 (T_exit - 60)

Right side: 88.7 * 0.000506 ≈ 0.0448, so 0.0448 (80 - T_exit)

So,

42.218 (T_exit - 60) = 0.0448 (80 - T_exit)

Expanding:

42.218 T_exit - 42.218 * 60 = 3.584 - 0.0448 T_exit

Compute 42.218 * 60 ≈ 2533.08

So,

42.218 T_exit - 2533.08 = 3.584 - 0.0448 T_exit

Bring all T_exit terms to left and constants to right:

42.218 T_exit + 0.0448 T_exit = 3.584 + 2533.08

Factor T_exit:

(42.218 + 0.0448) T_exit = 2536.664

42.2628 T_exit = 2536.664

T_exit ≈ 2536.664 / 42.2628 ≈ 60.03°C

Again, the same result. It's impossible, so I must be making a mistake in the setup.

Wait a moment, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect. Maybe the correct formula is:

(T_exit - T_in) = (h A L) / (m_dot c_p) * (T_wall - T_in) / (1 + (h A L)/(m_dot c_p))

But let's compute that.

h A L = 88.7 * 0.000506 * 3 ≈ 0.1346 W/K

m_dot c_p = 42.218 W/K

So,

(T_exit - T_in) = (0.1346 * (80 - 60)) / (42.218 + 0.1346) ≈ (0.1346 * 20) / 42.3526 ≈ 2.692 / 42.3526 ≈ 0.0635°C

Thus,

T_exit ≈ 60 + 0.0635 ≈ 60.06°C

Still the same result. This suggests that the heat transfer is negligible, which can't be right because the wall is at 80°C and the fluid is at 60°C.

Wait, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the formula should be:

(T_exit - T_in) = (h A L) / (m_dot c_p) * (T_wall - T_in) * (1 - exp( - (m_dot c_p)/(h A) ))

So,

= (0.1346 * 20) * (1 - exp( - (42.218)/(0.0448) )) ≈ (2.692) * (1 - exp(-942.2)) ≈ 2.692 * (1 - 0) ≈ 2.692°C

So,

T_exit ≈ 60 + 2.692 ≈ 62.69°C

That's more reasonable. But how did I get this?

Wait, I think the correct formula for the exit temperature when the wall is at a constant temperature is:

(T_exit - T_in) = ( (h A L) / (m_dot c_p) ) * (T_wall - T_in) * (1 - exp( - (m_dot c_p)/(h A) ))

But let's compute the exponent:

(m_dot c_p)/(h A) = 42.218 / 0.0448 ≈ 942.2

exp(-942.2) is practically zero, so:

(T_exit - T_in) ≈ (0.1346 * 20) * 1 ≈ 2.692°C

Thus,

T_exit ≈ 60 + 2.692 ≈ 62.69°C

But that's not one of the options. The options are around 70-74°C. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the pipe is long enough that the temperature profile approaches the wall temperature, but in this case, the pipe is only 3 meters long, which might not be long enough.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula. Another approach is to use the formula for the exit temperature in a pipe with uniform heat flux:

T_exit = T_in + ( (h A L) / (m_dot c_p) ) * (T_wall - T_in) * (1 - (m_dot c_p)/(h A L))

Wait, but that seems incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

(T_exit - T_in) = (h A L)/(m_dot c_p) * (T_wall - T_in) * (1 - exp( - (m_dot c_p)/(h A) ))

Which gives us:

= (0.1346 * 20) * (1 - exp(-942.2)) ≈ 2.692 * (1 - 0) ≈ 2.692°C

So T_exit ≈ 62.69°C, which is not among the options. So perhaps I'm still wrong.

Wait, maybe I should consider the pipe's thermal resistance. The thermal resistance R is R = (T_wall - T_exit) / Q, where Q is the heat transfer rate.

But Q = m_dot c_p (T_exit - T_in)

So,

R = (T_wall - T_exit) / (m_dot c_p (T_exit - T_in))

But R is also R = 1/(h A)

So,

1/(h A) = (T_wall - T_exit)/(m_dot c_p (T_exit - T_in))

Rearranging,

m_dot c_p (T_exit - T_in) = h A (T_wall - T_exit)

Which is the same equation as before, leading to T_exit ≈ 60.03°C.

This suggests that either the problem is incorrectly set up, or I'm missing something fundamental.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the mass flow rate. Let me double-check.

Diameter D = 2.54 cm = 0.0254 m

Radius r = 0.0127 m

Area A = π r² ≈ 3.1416 * (0.0127)^2 ≈ 3.1416 * 0.00016129 ≈ 0.000506 m².

Velocity v = 0.02 m/s.

Volume flow rate V_dot = A * v = 0.000506 * 0.02 ≈ 0.00001012 m³/s.

Density rho = 998 kg/m³.

Mass flow rate m_dot = rho * V_dot = 998 * 0.00001012 ≈ 0.0100996 kg/s ≈ 0.0101 kg/s. That seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula for the exit temperature as T_exit = T_in + ( (m_dot c_p L) / (h A) ) * (T_wall - T_in)

But let's try that:

(m_dot c_p L)/(h A) = (0.0101 * 4180 * 3) / (88.7 * 0.000506) ≈ (126.534) / (0.0448) ≈ 2824.3

So,

T_exit = 60 + 2824.3 * (80 - 60) = 60 + 2824.3 * 20 ≈ 60 + 56486 ≈ 56496°C. That's way too high, so that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the formula is T_exit = T_in + ( (h A L)/(m_dot c_p) ) * (T_wall - T_in)

Which gives:

(88.7 * 0.000506 * 3)/(0.0101 * 4180) * (80 -60) ≈ (0.1346)/(42.218) * 20 ≈ 0.003187 * 20 ≈ 0.0637°C

So, T_exit ≈ 60.0637°C. Still not matching the options.

I'm stuck. Given the options provided (70.95, 71.95, etc.), the correct answer must be around 71-74°C. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in calculating h.

Wait, perhaps I should use the thermal conductivity (k) in the formula for h in laminar flow. Let me try that.

In laminar flow, h can be calculated using:

h = (k * (v D^2)) / (32 * L * (T_wall - T_in))

But that seems dimensionally incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

h = (k * v * D) / ( (32 * L) * (T_wall - T_in) )

But that would have units of W/(m²·K), which is correct.

So,

h = (0.617 * 0.02 * 0.0254) / (32 * 3 * (80 - 60))

Compute numerator: 0.617 * 0.02 = 0.01234; 0.01234 * 0.0254 ≈ 0.0003133 W/(m²·K).

Denominator: 32 * 3 = 96; 96 * 20 = 1920.

So,

h ≈ 0.0003133 / 1920 ≈ 1.632e-7 W/(m²·K). That's way too low, so this approach is wrong.

At this point, I think I've exhausted all possible approaches and am not getting a reasonable result. Given the options, I suspect that the correct approach leads to an exit temperature around 72°C, which is option A: 72.95°C.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the exit temperature of water flowing through a heated pipe under steady-state conditions. The key parameters provided are:

- **Flow speed**: \( v = 0.02 \, \text{m/s} \)
- **Pipe length**: \( L = 3.0 \, \text{m} \)
- **Pipe diameter**: \( D = 2.54 \, \text{cm} = 0.0254 \, \text{m} \)
- **Wall temperature**: \( T_{\text{wall}} = 80^\circ \text{C} \)
- **Inlet temperature**: \( T_{\text{in}} = 60^\circ \text{C} \)

The goal is to determine the exit temperature \( T_{\text{exit}} \). The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Mass Flow Rate Calculation**:
   - Cross-sectional area of the pipe:  
     \[
     A = \pi \left(\frac{D}{2}\right)^2 = \pi (0.0127)^2 \approx 0.000506 \, \text{m}^2
     \]
   - Volume flow rate:  
     \[
     \dot{V} = A \cdot v = 0.000506 \cdot 0.02 \approx 0.00001012 \, \text{m}^3/\text{s}
     \]
   - Mass flow rate:  
     \[
     \dot{m} = \rho \cdot \dot{V} = 998 \cdot 0.00001012 \approx 0.0101 \, \text{kg/s}
     \]

2. **Convective Heat Transfer Coefficient (\( h \))**:
   - The Reynolds number is calculated as:  
     \[
     \text{Re} = \frac{v \cdot D}{\nu} = \frac{0.02 \cdot 0.0254}{0.6501 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 781
     \]
   - Since \( \text{Re} < 2300 \), the flow is laminar. For laminar flow in a pipe with constant wall temperature, the Nusselt number is approximately \( \text{Nu} = 3.66 \). Using the relation \( \text{Nu} = \frac{h \cdot D}{k} \), where \( k = 0.617 \, \text{W/mK} \) (thermal conductivity of water), the convective heat transfer coefficient is:  
     \[
     h = \frac{\text{Nu} \cdot k}{D} = \frac{3.66 \cdot 0.617}{0.0254} \approx 88.7 \, \text{W/m}^2\text{K}
     \]

3. **Exit Temperature Calculation**:
   - Using Newton's Law of Cooling, the heat transfer equation is:  
     \[
     \dot{m} \cdot c_p \cdot (T_{\text{exit}} - T_{\text{in}}) = h \cdot A \cdot (T_{\text{wall}} - T_{\text{exit}})
     \]
     Rearranging for \( T_{\text{exit}} \):  
     \[
     T_{\text{exit}} = \frac{\dot{m} \cdot c_p \cdot T_{\text{in}} + h \cdot A \cdot T_{\text{wall}}}{\dot{m} \cdot c_p + h \cdot A}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     - \( \dot{m} \cdot c_p = 0.0101 \cdot 4180 \approx 42.218 \, \text{W/K} \)
     - \( h \cdot A = 88.7 \cdot 0.000506 \approx 0.0448 \, \text{W/K} \)
     - Numerator: \( 42.218 \cdot 60 + 0.0448 \cdot 80 \approx 2533.08 + 3.584 \approx 2536.664 \, \text{W} \)
     - Denominator: \( 42.218 + 0.0448 \approx 42.2628 \, \text{W/K} \)
     - Exit temperature:  
       \[
       T_{\text{exit}} = \frac{2536.664}{42.2628} \approx 60.03^\circ \text{C}
       \]

4. **Reevaluation**:
   - The calculated exit temperature of \( 60.03^\circ \text{C} \) is inconsistent with the expected result, as the water should absorb heat and increase in temperature. This discrepancy suggests an error in the assumptions or calculations, particularly in the heat transfer coefficient or the model used.

5. **Final Answer Selection**:
   - Given the options provided and the expected range for the exit temperature, the most reasonable choice is **72.95°C**, corresponding to **Option A**.

ANSWER: A
