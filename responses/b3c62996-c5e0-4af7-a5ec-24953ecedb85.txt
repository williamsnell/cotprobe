Question:

A defendant was arrested and charged with burglarizing a home. At trial, the main issue of contention centered on the identity of the burglar. The state called the homeowner to testify, but his identification testimony was inconclusive. The homeowner testified that he was asleep during the burglary and awoke as the burglar was fleeing the premises. The homeowner admitted that he didn't see the face of the burglar and couldn't even tell whether the person was male or female. Thereafter, the prosecution offers evidence that at the time of the burglary, the defendant needed money to defend himself against other burglary charges. This proffered evidence should be

Options:

A: excluded, as it distracts from the main issue of identifying the burglar.
B: admitted as it shows the defendant's potential desperation.
C: excluded as it does not provide direct evidence of the defendant's involvement in the crime.
D: admitted without restriction as probative evidence of motive.
E: excluded as substantially more unfairly prejudicial than probative.
F: excluded as it could lead to bias against the defendant.
G: excluded as lacking any probative value.
H: admitted, but with a cautionary instruction from the judge to the jury to consider the evidence carefully.
I: admitted, provided the court instructs the jury to limit use of the evidence to the defendant's motive to burglarize.
J: admitted, provided the court instructs the jury to consider the defendant's financial status.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with what evidence can be admitted at trial. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about a defendant charged with burglary. The main issue is identifying the burglar. The homeowner, who was the victim, testified but couldn't conclusively identify the defendant. He was asleep during the burglary and only saw the burglar fleeing, but he didn't see the face and couldn't tell the gender. So, the prosecution is offering evidence that at the time of the burglary, the defendant needed money to defend against other burglary charges. The question is whether this evidence should be admitted or excluded.

I remember that evidence is admissible if it's relevant, meaning it has a tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence. Also, relevance can be about motive, opportunity, intent, and so on. But there are exceptions and rules about how evidence can be used.

In this case, the prosecution is trying to show that the defendant needed money because he was facing other burglary charges. So, the idea is that this need for money could show a motive to commit the burglary in question. Motive is generally relevant because it can indicate why someone would commit a crime.

But wait, there are some rules about when motive can be used. I think under the Federal Rules of Evidence, evidence of a defendant's motive is generally admissible. Motive can be a factor in establishing intent or showing that the defendant had a reason to commit the crime. However, there are some caveats. For example, evidence of a motive shouldn't be so remote that it's irrelevant, and it shouldn't be used to suggest that the defendant has a criminal propensity.

Here, the defendant needed money to defend against other burglary charges. That seems like a specific situation, but does it establish a motive for the current burglary? It suggests that he might have been under financial pressure, which could have driven him to commit this burglary. So, it might be relevant to show that he had a reason to commit the crime.

But wait, there's another angle. The defendant's need for money is being offered to show why he would commit this burglary. However, the problem is that the identification is the main issue. The homeowner couldn't identify the defendant, so the state's case relies heavily on other evidence, possibly including this need for money as circumstantial evidence of motive.

But let me think about the possible answers. Option D says it's admitted without restriction as probative of motive. Option E says it's excluded because it's more unfairly prejudicial than probative. Option C says it's excluded as it doesn't provide direct evidence of involvement. Option I suggests it's admitted but limited to motive. Option J says admitted with a caution about financial status.

Wait, I also recall that the need for money can be a valid motive, but sometimes courts are cautious about it because it's a common situation and might not specifically link the defendant to the crime. However, in this case, the prosecution is using it to show why the defendant would commit this burglary, which is a proper use of motive.

Another point: the evidence relates to the defendant's state of mind at the time of the crime. Need for money can show intent or purpose, which are elements of the crime. So, it's relevant. But I also remember that sometimes, evidence of motive can be admitted but the court might give a limiting instruction to prevent the jury from thinking it shows a bad character or criminal propensity.

Looking at the options, D says admitted without restriction as probative of motive. I is admitted but limited to motive. J is admitted with a caution about financial status.

Wait, the question is about whether the evidence should be admitted. The fact that the defendant needed money because of other charges could be relevant to his motive. So, the evidence is probative of motive, but it's not direct evidence of guilt. It's circumstantial.

But under the rules, evidence of a motive is generally admissible unless it's more prejudicial than probative. So, if the evidence is relevant and not unduly prejudicial, it should be admitted. However, sometimes courts might limit the use of such evidence to prevent misuse.

Option I says it's admitted provided the court instructs the jury to limit it to the defendant's motive to burglarize. That makes sense because the evidence could otherwise be used to imply a general tendency to commit crimes, which isn't proper.

Alternatively, Option D says it's admitted without restriction, but that might not be correct because the court might want to limit the jury's consideration to prevent misuse.

So, the correct approach is that the evidence is admissible for showing motive, but the court should instruct the jury to consider it only for that purpose. Therefore, the answer would be option I.

Wait, but in the options, I is "admitted, provided the court instructs the jury to limit use of the evidence to the defendant's motive to burglarize." That seems correct because it allows the evidence in but restricts its purpose.

Alternatively, D says it's admitted without restriction, which might not be accurate because the court often gives limiting instructions when motive is admitted to prevent the jury from using it improperly.

So, I think the correct answer is I.

The evidence that the defendant needed money to defend against other burglary charges is relevant to show a motive for committing the crime in question. Motive is generally admissible as it can indicate why the defendant might have committed the crime. However, courts often instruct juries to consider such evidence only for the purpose of establishing motive and not as evidence of a general tendency to commit crimes. Therefore, the evidence should be admitted but limited to its purpose of showing motive.

Answer: I
