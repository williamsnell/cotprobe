Question:

On May 2, a woman mailed the following letter to a man:"May 1I have two tickets to the concert on July 1 at the auditorium in town. I'll sell them to you for $60 per ticket, which is $10 above face value. Since the concert has been sold out for months, I think that is a good deal. You have 15 days from the above date to decide whether to accept this offer. "The man received the letter on May 4, but did not read it until May 6. On May 18, the man went to the woman's home and attempted to accept the offer. The woman replied:"Too late! I sold the tickets last week for $75 each. "Assume that the woman's letter created in the man a valid power of acceptance. Was that power terminated by lapse of time before the man went to the woman's home on May 17?

Options:

A: Yes, because the letter was mailed on May 2.
B: Yes, because the letter was dated May 1.
C: No, because the man received the letter on May 4.
D: No, because the man did not read the letter until May 6.

Okay, so I've got this question about contract law, specifically regarding offers and acceptances. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The scenario is that a woman mailed a letter to a man on May 2. The letter is dated May 1, which is a bit odd because she mailed it on the 2nd but it's dated the 1st. In the letter, she offers to sell concert tickets for $60 each, which is $10 above face value. She tells the man he has 15 days from May 1 to decide. So the offer period ends on May 16, right? Because 15 days after May 1 is May 16.

The man receives the letter on May 4 but doesn't read it until May 6. Then, on May 18, he goes to the woman's home to accept. But she says it's too late because she sold the tickets last week for $75 each.

The question is whether the woman's offer gave the man a valid power of acceptance, and whether that power was terminated by the lapse of time before May 18. So, we're focusing on whether the man's attempt to accept on May 18 was timely.

First, I need to recall the rules about offers and the time for acceptance. In the common law, an offer usually remains open until the time specified or until it lapses. Here, the offer was for 15 days from May 1. So, the offer would be open until May 16.

Wait, but the letter was mailed on May 2, right? So, when did the man receive it? On May 4. But he didn't read it until May 6. Does this affect the time he has to accept? Because the offer was made on May 1, and he received it on May 4. So, he has 15 days from May 1, which would end on May 16. But he didn't read it until May 6, so he had until May 16 to accept, regardless of when he read it.

Wait, no, the time for acceptance starts when the offer is received. Or does it start from the date the offer was made? Hmm. The offer was made on May 1, with 15 days from that date. So the offer's expiration is May 16. The man received the offer on May 4, but the time period started on May 1. So he had until May 16 to accept, even if he read it later.

So, when did he try to accept? On May 18, which is after May 16. So the offer had already expired. Therefore, his acceptance was too late. But wait, the question is whether the power of acceptance was terminated by lapse of time before May 18. So, yes, because the 15 days ended on May 16, and he tried to accept on the 18th, which is after.

But the options are a bit tricky. Let's look at the options again.

Option A: Yes, because the letter was mailed on May 2. Mailing date might not be the effective date; the offer was dated May 1. So the time starts from May 1.

Option B: Yes, because the letter was dated May 1. That seems correct because the offer period is 15 days from May 1.

Options C and D: No, because the man received it on May 4 or didn't read it until May 6. But the time for acceptance doesn't start from when he received it; it starts from when the offer was made. So the fact that he received it later doesn't extend the time. So options C and D are incorrect.

So the correct answer should be B: Yes, because the letter was dated May 1. That makes the offer expire on May 16, and the man's acceptance on May 18 is too late.

The offer was made on May 1 with a validity period of 15 days, expiring on May 16. The man received the letter on May 4 but didn't read it until May 6. However, the time for acceptance started on May 1, so the offer expired on May 16. The man's attempt to accept on May 18 was after the expiration. 

Answer: B
