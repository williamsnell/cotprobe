Question:

An eager AP Biology student interested in studying osmosis and the movement of water in solutions took a dialysis bag containing a 0.5 M solution and placed it into a beaker containing a 0.6 M solution. If this bag were instead placed into a beaker of distilled water, what would be the expected result?

Options:

A: The bag will expand and eventually burst due to the pressure of water flow.
B: The solute will flow into the dialysis bag from the beaker.
C: The bag will remain the exact same size because no water will move at all.
D: The bag will shrink in size and the beaker will overflow due to the movement of water.
E: The solute will flow out of the dialysis bag into the beaker.
F: The water will evaporate from the bag, leaving only the solute.
G: There will be a net flow of water into the bag, causing it to swell in size.
H: There will be a net flow of water out of the beaker, causing it to decrease in size.
I: The water in the bag will freeze due to the change in environment.
J: There will be a net flow of water out of the bag, causing it to decrease in size.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this biology question about osmosis and dialysis bags. Let's see what the question says. 

The student has a dialysis bag with a 0.5 M solution. They first placed it in a beaker with a 0.6 M solution. Then, the question is, what happens if they put the same bag into distilled water instead?

Hmm, I remember that osmosis is the movement of water across a semipermeable membrane from an area of lower solute concentration to higher solute concentration. The dialysis bag acts as a semipermeable membrane, allowing small molecules like water to pass through but not the larger solute particles.

In the first scenario, the bag is in a 0.6 M solution. The inside is 0.5 M, so the solute concentration outside is higher. That means water should move out of the bag into the beaker because the solution inside is less concentrated. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the water moves from lower solute to higher. So if the inside is 0.5 and outside is 0.6, the outside is higher. So water would move out of the bag into the beaker. That would make the bag shrink.

But the question is about changing the solution to distilled water. Distilled water is 0 M solute. So now the inside of the bag is 0.5 M, and the outside is 0 M. So the solute concentration is higher inside. Therefore, water should move into the bag because the concentration of solute is higher inside. So the bag would expand because water is moving in.

Wait, but the options don't have a direct answer about expanding. Let's look at the options again.

Option A: The bag will expand and eventually burst. That might happen if the pressure builds up. But does that happen in this case? I'm not sure. I think if it's a dialysis bag, it's usually flexible, so maybe it just swells without bursting unless the pressure is too much.

Option G: Net flow of water into the bag, causing it to swell. That sounds right. Because the inside is more concentrated, water flows in.

Option J: Net flow out of the bag. That would be if the outside was more concentrated, which isn't the case here.

So in the first scenario, when the bag was in 0.6 M, water would leave the bag (so it shrinks), but when moved to distilled water, water enters, so the bag expands.

Looking at the question again, they're asking what happens when the bag is placed into distilled water. So the expected result is that the bag will expand because water moves in.

Wait, but looking at the options, G says net flow into the bag, causing it to swell. That sounds correct. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but in the initial setup, the bag was placed in 0.6 M, and the question is about moving it to distilled water. So the first part is the setup, the second is the new condition.

So yes, the bag in distilled water (0 M) would have water moving into it because the inside is 0.5 M. So the correct answer is G.

When the dialysis bag containing a 0.5 M solution is placed in distilled water (0 M), water will move into the bag due to osmosis because the solute concentration inside the bag is higher. This movement of water into the bag will cause it to expand in size.

Answer: G
