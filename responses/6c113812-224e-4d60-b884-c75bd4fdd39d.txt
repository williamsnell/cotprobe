Alright, so I have this question about who said "Jurisprudence is the eye of law." Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my legal philosophy, but let's try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to recall which legal theorists are associated with which quotes. The options are A through J, with names like Austin, Pound, Savigny, and others. I remember that Austin was a significant figure in legal positivism, but I'm not sure if he made that specific statement.

Pound is another name that comes to mind. He was an American legal scholar, and I think he had some notable quotes about law and jurisprudence. Maybe that's where the quote comes from. But wait, I'm not 100% certain.

Then there's Savigny, who I believe was a German legal thinker. His ideas were more about the historical development of law, so I'm not sure if he's the one who referred to jurisprudence as the eye of law.

Blackstone wrote the Commentaries on the Laws of England, which is a foundational text, but I don't recall him making that specific statement about jurisprudence being the eye.

Bentham was a utilitarian, focusing on the greatest good for the greatest number, but again, not sure about that quote.

Dworkin was more about the theory of law as integrity, and Hart with his concept of law as rules. Kelsen was into the idea of a pure theory of law, but I don't think he's the one.

Maine was an historian of law, known for his work on early law systems, but I don't remember that quote from him.

Laski was a political philosopher, so maybe not. And then there's Dworkin, but I think I covered that.

Wait, I think I've heard this quote before in the context of legal education or the role of jurisprudence as the guiding principle. Pound did talk a lot about the role of law in society and the importance of understanding law through its principles. So maybe he's the one who said that.

Alternatively, I'm trying to think if Austin ever referred to jurisprudence in that way. Austin's main contribution was the separation of the "command" theory of law, but I don't recall him using that metaphor.

So, putting it all together, I'm leaning towards Pound as the author of that quote. He emphasized the role of jurisprudence in understanding and shaping the law, so "the eye of law" makes sense as a metaphor for that guiding and perceptive function.

The quote "Jurisprudence is the eye of law" is attributed to Roscoe Pound, an influential American legal scholar known for his contributions to legal philosophy and the concept of sociological jurisprudence. He emphasized the role of jurisprudence in understanding and shaping the law, making "the eye of law" a fitting metaphor for his ideas.
