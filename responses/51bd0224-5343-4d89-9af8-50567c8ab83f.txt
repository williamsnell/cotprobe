Question:

One computer in a lab is programmed to back up data at the turn of the minute every five minutes. Another computer is programmed to back up data at the turn of the minute every two minutes. Find the number of times in twenty-four hours that the two computers back up data at the same time. (Assume that the computers do not back up at the start of the 24-hour period.)

Options:

A: 144
B: 240
C: 36
D: 180
E: 72
F: 12
G: 6
H: 60
I: 120
J: 48

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about two computers backing up data at different intervals and figuring out how often they back up at the same time within a 24-hour period. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the problem says one computer backs up every five minutes at the turn of the minute. So that means it backs up at 0 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, and so on. The other computer does the same but every two minutes, so it's at 0, 2, 4, 6, etc. But the question specifies that they don't back up at the start of the 24-hour period, so I guess the first backup for both would be at their respective intervals after the start.

I need to find how many times their backup times overlap in 24 hours. Hmm, this sounds like a problem involving least common multiples (LCM) because I'm looking for the times when both events coincide.

Let me think: The first computer backups every 5 minutes, so its backup times are at 5, 10, 15, 20, etc. The second one is every 2 minutes: 2, 4, 6, 8, etc. Wait, but wait, the problem says "at the turn of the minute," so maybe it's at exact minute marks. So, maybe the first backup for the first computer is at 5 minutes, then 10, 15, etc. Similarly, the second computer starts at 2 minutes, then 4, 6, etc.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should consider the first backup time as the first minute mark after the start. So the first computer would back up at 5, 10, 15, etc., and the second at 2,4,6, etc. But if they don't back up at the start (0 minutes), then the first possible overlap might be after 5 minutes for the first computer and 2 minutes for the second.

Wait, but maybe I should model this as the times when both events happen. So, the backup times for the first computer are 5,10,15,... and for the second computer are 2,4,6,8,... So I'm looking for times t where t is a multiple of both 5 and 2, but since they don't start at 0, the first possible common backup would be the next time after 0 where both have backed up. So the LCM of 5 and 2 is 10. So the first overlap is at 10 minutes, then 20, 30, etc.

Wait, but that can't be right because that would imply that the two computers back up together every 10 minutes, but I need to check if that's accurate.

Wait, let me think again. The first computer is every 5 minutes: 5,10,15,20,25,30,... The second is every 2 minutes: 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24,... So looking for common times: 10,20,30, etc. So yes, every 10 minutes. So the LCM of 5 and 2 is 10, so they back up together every 10 minutes.

Now, the total time is 24 hours. Let me convert that into minutes. 24 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 1440 minutes.

Now, how many times does this 10-minute interval occur in 1440 minutes? Well, starting from 10 minutes up to 1440, but wait, the first backup together is at 10 minutes. So the number of times would be 1440 / 10 = 144. So that would be 144 times. But wait, does that include the 0 minute mark? Because 1440 is exactly 24 hours, so 1440 /10 is 144, but since they don't back up at 0, does the last backup at 1440 count? Because 1440 is the end of the 24-hour period. So if the first backup is at 10, the next at 20, and so on, the last one would be at 1440 minutes, which is exactly 24 hours. But the problem says they don't back up at the start, but does it say anything about the end? Hmm.

Wait, the problem says "the turn of the minute every five minutes" and "every two minutes," so perhaps the 1440th minute is included. So the number of backups would be 1440 /10 = 144, but including the 10th minute up to the 1440th minute. Wait, but 1440 is 24*60, so is 1440 included? Let me check: 1440 divided by 10 is 144, so that would be 144 times. But wait, if the first time is at 10, then the next is at 20, and so on, up to 1440, that's 144 times.

Wait, but wait, 10*144=1440, so that's correct. So the answer would be 144 times, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes when dealing with intervals, the number of occurrences can be tricky. For example, how many multiples of 10 are there between 1 and 1440 inclusive? Well, 10,20,...,1440: that's 1440/10 =144 numbers. So yes, that's correct.

But wait, the problem says they don't back up at the start, so the first common backup is at 10 minutes, and the last one is at 1440 minutes, which is exactly 24 hours. So that's included. So 144 times in total.

Looking at the options, option A is 144. So the answer should be A.

The two computers back up together every 10 minutes, as the LCM of 5 and 2 is 10. Over 1440 minutes (24 hours), they back up together 144 times, including the 1440-minute mark.
