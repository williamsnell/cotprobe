Options:

A: The subroutine procedure checks if each length value is between 0 and 100
B: The subroutine procedure returns the length value to the main program
C: The subroutine procedure is called only once in the program
D: The subroutine procedure is called at the beginning and end of the main program to validate the length
E: The subroutine procedure is called multiple times, each time incrementing the length value by 1
F: The subroutine procedure is called from three different points in the program, checks if each length value is between 0 and 90, and returns control to the main program.
G: The subroutine procedure is used to exit the main program if the length is within the specified range
H: The subroutine procedure is called recursively within itself to handle multiple length values
I: The subroutine procedure generates a list of length values from 0 to 90
J: The subroutine procedure is a loop that continues until the length value is outside the range of 0 to 90

Okay, so I need to figure out what the subroutine procedure does in this given code. Let me read through the code carefully.

The main procedure is called VERIFY_TEST_VALUES. Inside it, there's a call to GET_AND_TEST_INPUT. Looking at GET_AND_TEST_INPUT, it starts with a label AGAIN. Then it calls GETLIST(LENGTH), which probably gets a value and assigns it to LENGTH.

Next, if LENGTH is 0, it goes to L. Wait, L is the end of VERIFY_TEST_VALUES, so maybe that's an exit point. If LENGTH is less than 0 or greater than 90, it does something. It puts a list with 'ERROR' and the LENGTH, then goes back to AGAIN. So it loops until LENGTH is within 0-90.

So the subroutine GET_AND_TEST_INPUT is checking each LENGTH value. If it's invalid, it shows an error and loops again. Once it's valid, it continues.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option F says the subroutine is called multiple times, each time checking if length is between 0 and 90, then returns control. The code in GET_AND_TEST_INPUT has a loop (AGAIN label) that continues until a valid length is entered, then returns. But looking at the main procedure, how many times is GET_AND_TEST_INPUT called?

In the main procedure, I see two calls to GET_AND_TEST_INPUT. The first call is before some bullets, then another call after. So it's called twice. So each time, it checks the length. If it's invalid, it loops until valid. So each call would handle one length check, perhaps for different purposes.

So the subroutine is called multiple times (twice in this case), each time checking if the length is between 0 and 90. Once valid, it returns to the main program.

Looking at the options, F says called multiple times, each time checking 0-90 and returns control. That seems to fit.

Other options: A says 0-100, but the code says 90. So A is wrong. B says returns the length, but the subroutine doesn't return a value, it just validates. C says called once, but it's called twice. D says called at beginning and end, but main proc has two calls, maybe for different parts. E says increments, no. G is about exiting if within range, but it's the opposite. H is recursive, no. I generates a list, no. J is a loop until out of range, but it's within the subroutine, but the main calls it multiple times.

So the correct answer should be F.
</think>

The subroutine procedure GET_AND_TEST_INPUT is called twice within the main procedure VERIFY_TEST_VALUES. Each call checks if the LENGTH value is within the range of 0 to 90. If the value is invalid, it displays an error message and loops back to re-enter a valid length. Once a valid length is provided, the subroutine returns control to the main program. This process ensures that the main program only proceeds with valid length values.

Answer: F
