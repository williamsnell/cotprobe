Okay, so I've got this problem about a brass rod carrying a sinusoidal current, and I need to find the dissipated power per centimeter of length. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, the problem states that the current density J is given by J = 0.01e^πr sin(ωt + πr) ampere/cm². Wait, that looks a bit odd. I'm pretty sure that the exponent in the current density expression should probably involve r, but the way it's written, it's e raised to πr, multiplied by sin(...). Or maybe I'm misinterpreting it. Let me check: J = 0.01 * e^(πr) * sin(ωt + πr). Hmm, that's how it's written. That seems a bit complicated, but maybe it's correct.

Wait, but the problem says that r represents the distance from the center in centimeters. So, the current density varies exponentially with r? Because e^(πr) would increase rapidly as r increases. But wait, for a conductor, the current density typically varies with radius, but usually in a linear fashion in a cylindrical conductor. Oh, wait, but this seems to be a sinusoidal current, so maybe the current is varying in time as well as space. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

The goal is to find the dissipated power per centimeter of length. I remember that power dissipation in a conductor is related to the current and the resistivity. Oh, wait, the formula for power per unit length is P/L = J² * (resistivity) * (cross-sectional area?), or maybe something like that. Wait, no, power is usually P = I² R, but when dealing with current density and conductivity, it's different. Oh right, power per unit volume is J² / σ, where σ is the conductivity. So power per unit length would be the integral over the cross-sectional area of (J² / σ) times the length element, but since we're looking for per cm of length, maybe we can compute the integral over the cross-section and then per cm.

Wait, let me think again. The general formula for power dissipation is P = I² R, but when using current density, R is the resistance of the material. For a conductor, R = ρ * (L/A), where ρ is resistivity, L is length, and A is cross-sectional area. So, substituting into P, we get P = I² * (ρ L / A). But since I is the total current, which is the integral of J over the area, I = ∫ J dA. So P = ( ∫ J dA )² * (ρ L / A ). But this seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, the power per unit volume is (J²)/σ, since σ = 1/ρ. So the total power would be the integral of (J²/σ) dA. But since we're looking for power per unit length, L, perhaps we can compute (J²/σ) integrated over the cross-sectional area and then divide by L, but wait, actually, J is per area, so maybe I should think in terms of per cm of length.

Wait, let me get this straight. The power per unit length (P/L) would be the integral over the cross-sectional area of (J² / σ) times (length element). But since we're integrating over the cross-section, and the length is 1 cm, perhaps P/L is the integral over the cross-section of (J² / σ) multiplied by the length, which is 1 cm. So P/L = ∫ (J² / σ) dA, where dA is the area element.

But wait, J here is given as a function of r and time. But since power is an instantaneous quantity, but the question is about dissipated power per cm, which I think refers to the average power. Because when dealing with sinusoidal currents, the average power is what matters for dissipation. So we'll need to find the average of J² over time.

So first, let's express J in terms of r and t. J(r,t) = 0.01 e^{π r} sin(ωt + π r). Wait, that seems a bit odd. Because if the exponent is e^{π r}, that's e multiplied by π times r, which would be a very large number for r in cm. But r here is in centimeters, and the cross-section radius is 2.1 cm. So, e^{π * 2.1} is a huge number, like e^6.597 ≈ 700. So J would be 0.01 * 700 * sin(...) ≈ 7 A/cm². That seems way too high. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the exponent. Let me check the problem again.

Wait, the problem says J = 0.01e^π r sin(ωt + π r). Wait, that notation can be ambiguous. Is it e raised to (π multiplied by r), or is it e multiplied by π multiplied by r? Because if it's e^(π r), that's correct as I thought. But that would make J extremely large at r=2.1 cm, which seems unrealistic. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, and the exponent is e^{π} multiplied by r, but that would be e^π * r, which is about 23.14 * r. So J would be 0.01 * 23.14 r sin(...), which would make more sense, as J would increase linearly with r.

Wait, perhaps the intended expression is J = 0.01 e^{π r} sin(ωt + π r), but that would cause J to be extremely large at r=2.1 cm. Alternatively, maybe it's J = 0.01 e^{π} r sin(ωt + π r), which would be J = 0.01 * e^π * r sin(...). Let me calculate e^π: e is about 2.718, so e^3 ≈ 20.085, but π is about 3.1416, so e^π ≈ 23.14. So 0.01 * 23.14 r would be 0.2314 r A/cm². That seems more reasonable, as at r=2.1 cm, J would be about 0.486 A/cm², which is manageable.

Wait, but the problem as written is J = 0.01e^π r sin(...), so I think the exponent is e^{π r}, which is e^(π*r), so r in cm, which would make J(r) = 0.01 * e^{π r} * sin(ωt + π r). But that would mean J increases exponentially with r, which is possible, but perhaps the problem intended it differently. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, but maybe I should proceed with the given expression.

So, the first step is to find the average power dissipation per unit length. The average power per unit volume is (J²) / σ, averaged over time. Since J varies sinusoidally, the time average of J² is (0.01e^{π r})² * (average of sin²(...)).

The average of sin²(ωt + φ) over time is 1/2. So the average J² is (0.01e^{π r})² * (1/2) = 0.00005 e^{2π r}.

So, the average power per unit volume is (0.00005 e^{2π r}) / σ, where σ is 1.57e5 mhos/cm. Wait, mhos/cm is the same as (1/ohm/cm), so units are conductance per cm. So σ is 1.57e5 S/cm.

Wait, but mhos are the same as Siemens (S), so yes, σ is 1.57e5 S/cm.

So, power per unit volume is (0.00005 e^{2π r}) / (1.57e5). Let me compute that:

0.00005 is 5e-5, so 5e-5 / 1.57e5 = (5/1.57) * 1e-10 ≈ 3.184e-10. So 3.184e-10 * e^{2π r}.

But wait, that's per unit volume. Now, to get the power per unit length, I need to integrate this over the cross-sectional area and then consider the length as 1 cm. Wait, no, because the volume element is area (dA) times length (dz). So, if we're looking for power per unit length, we can compute the integral of (power per volume) * dA, and since the length is 1 cm, it's just the integral over the cross-sectional area.

So, P/L = ∫ (3.184e-10 e^{2π r}) * dA

But wait, the cross-section is a circle with radius a = 2.1 cm. So, in polar coordinates, dA = 2π r dr cm². So,

P/L = ∫ (from r=0 to r=2.1) [3.184e-10 e^{2π r}] * 2π r dr

Hmm, that integral looks a bit complicated. Let me write it as:

P/L = 2π * 3.184e-10 ∫ (r e^{2π r}) dr from 0 to 2.1

Let me compute the integral ∫ r e^{2π r} dr. Integration by parts: let u = r, dv = e^{2π r} dr. Then du = dr, v = (1/(2π)) e^{2π r}.

So, ∫ r e^{2π r} dr = (r/(2π)) e^{2π r} - ∫ (1/(2π)) e^{2π r} dr = (r/(2π)) e^{2π r} - (1/(2π)^2) e^{2π r} + C.

Evaluating from 0 to 2.1:

At r=2.1: (2.1/(2π)) e^{2π * 2.1} - (1/(2π)^2) e^{2π * 2.1}

At r=0: 0 - (1/(2π)^2) e^0 = -1/(4π²)

So, the integral from 0 to 2.1 is [ (2.1/(2π)) e^{4.2π} - (1/(4π²)) e^{4.2π} ] - [ -1/(4π²) ]

= e^{4.2π} [ (2.1/(2π) ) - (1/(4π²)) ] + 1/(4π² )

Hmm, this seems really big because e^{4.2π} is e^13.2, which is a huge number, around 4.85e5. That would make the integral enormous, leading to a P/L that's way too high. But the answer options are all in micro Watts per cm, which are very small. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I misinterpreted the exponent in J. Let me go back. The problem states J = 0.01e^π r sin(ωt + π r). Maybe it's 0.01 times e (Euler's number) multiplied by π multiplied by r, times sin(...). So J = 0.01 * e * π * r * sin(...). That would make J = 0.031416 r sin(...), which is a linear function of r. That makes more sense because J would then increase linearly with r, which is typical for a current distribution in a conductor.

If that's the case, then J(r,t) = 0.01 e π r sin(ωt + π r). Let me compute 0.01 * e * π: e ≈ 2.718, so 0.01 * 2.718 * 3.1416 ≈ 0.01 * 8.5398 ≈ 0.085398. So J(r,t) ≈ 0.0854 r sin(ωt + π r).

Wait, but the original problem says J = 0.01e^π r sin(...). So, perhaps it's 0.01 multiplied by e^π multiplied by r. e^π is approximately 23.14. So 0.01 * 23.14 = 0.2314. So J = 0.2314 r sin(...). That seems more reasonable.

Wait, I'm getting confused because the problem's notation is a bit ambiguous. The exponent could be e^{π r} or e multiplied by π multiplied by r. But given the answer options, I think the intended expression is J = 0.01 e^{π r} sin(...), but that leads to very high values, which don't match the answer choices. Alternatively, perhaps the exponent is e^{i π r}, but that would be complex, which doesn't make sense in this context.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, and the exponent is π r, so J = 0.01 e^{π r} sin(...). Let me proceed with that assumption, even though it leads to a large J.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the average power. Let me recompute:

Average J² = (0.01 e^{π r})² * (1/2) = 0.0001 e^{2π r} * (1/2) = 0.00005 e^{2π r}.

So, average power per unit volume is (0.00005 e^{2π r}) / σ.

σ is 1.57e5 S/cm, so 0.00005 / 1.57e5 = (5e-5) / (1.57e5) = 5/(1.57e10) ≈ 3.19e-10.

So power per unit volume is 3.19e-10 e^{2π r} W/cm³.

Now, to find P/L, we integrate this over the cross-sectional area. The area element in polar coordinates is 2π r dr cm². So,

P/L = ∫ (from 0 to 2.1) 3.19e-10 e^{2π r} * 2π r dr

= 2π * 3.19e-10 ∫ (r e^{2π r}) dr from 0 to 2.1.

Earlier, I tried integrating r e^{2π r} and found it to be a huge number because e^{4.2π} is about e^13.2 ≈ 4.85e5. But that would make the integral enormous, which can't be right because the answer options are in micro watts.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Let me check the units again.

J is given in A/cm². Conductivity σ is in mhos/cm, which is S/cm. So, J^2 has units (A/cm²)^2. Power per unit volume is J^2 / σ, which is (A²/cm^4) / (S/cm) ) → (A²/cm^4) * (cm/S) → (A²/(cm^3 S)). Since 1 S = 1 A/V, so 1/(S) = V/A. So units become (A² * V)/(cm^3 A) )= (A V)/(cm^3) )= (W)/(cm^3), which is correct.

So the integral gives P/L in W/cm. So the integral must compute to a small value, but I'm getting something huge. Maybe I made a mistake in the integral limits or the exponent.

Wait, perhaps the exponent in J is e^{π r} but with r in centimeters, which is manageable. Let me try to compute the integral numerically.

Wait, let me compute the integral ∫ (from 0 to 2.1) r e^{2π r} dr.

Let me compute this numerically. Let's approximate the integral using substitution or perhaps a calculator.

Alternatively, we can compute it as:

We have ∫ r e^{a r} dr = (e^{a r} (a r - 1 )) / a² + C.

So with a = 2π, the integral from 0 to 2.1 is:

[e^{2π r} (2π r - 1)] / (4π²) evaluated from 0 to 2.1.

At r=2.1:

e^{4.2π} (2π * 2.1 - 1) / (4π²) 

= e^{4.2π} (4.2π - 1) / (4π²)

At r=0:

e^0 (0 - 1) / (4π²) = (-1)/(4π²)

So the integral is [e^{4.2π} (4.2π - 1)/(4π²)] - [ (-1)/(4π²) ]

= [e^{4.2π} (4.2π - 1) + 1 ] / (4π²)

But e^{4.2π} is e^{~13.1946} ≈ 4.85e5 as before.

So plugging in the numbers:

Numerator ≈ 4.85e5 * (13.1946 - 1) + 1 ≈ 4.85e5 * 12.1946 + 1 ≈ 4.85e5 * 12.1946 ≈ approx 5.93e6 + 1 ≈ 5.93e6

Denominator: 4π² ≈ 39.478.

So the integral ≈ (5.93e6) / 39.478 ≈ 1.50e5.

Now, multiply by 2π * 3.19e-10:

P/L ≈ 2 * 3.1416 * 3.19e-10 * 1.50e5

= 6.2832 * 3.19e-10 * 1.5e5

First, 6.2832 * 3.19e-10 ≈ 2.009e-9.

Then, 2.009e-9 * 1.5e5 ≈ 3.0135e-4 W/cm.

Wait, 3.0135e-4 W/cm is 301.35 microW/cm. But none of the answer options are that high. The highest option is C: 31.8 microW/cm. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the units in the calculation. Let me check the units again.

J is given in A/cm², conductivity σ is 1.57e5 mhos/cm, which is S/cm. So J² is (A²/cm^4), and J² / σ is (A²/cm^4) * (S/cm) ) → (A² S)/(cm^5). Wait, S is Siemens, which is S = A/V. So (A² * A/V)/cm^5 → (A^3)/(V cm^5). That doesn't seem right for power. Wait, maybe I messed up the units earlier.

Wait, power per unit volume is J² / σ. Let me recompute the units:

J is in A/cm². So J² is (A²)/(cm^4). σ is in S/cm, which is (S/cm) = (A/V)/cm = A/(V cm). So J² / σ is (A²/cm^4) / (A/(V cm)) ) = (A²/cm^4) * (V cm)/A ) = (A V) / cm^3.

Since 1 W = 1 J/s = 1 (V A), so (A V)/cm^3 is W/cm^3. That's correct.

So the calculation seems dimensionally correct, but the result is way off from the answer options.

Wait, perhaps the exponent in J is not e^{π r}, but e^{i π r}, but that would make J complex, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem intended J to be J = 0.01 e^{i ω t} * e^{π r} sin(π r), but that doesn't quite make sense either.

Alternatively, perhaps the current density is J = 0.01 e^{π r} sin(ω t + ... ), but perhaps I misread the phase. Let me check the problem again.

The problem says J = 0.01 e^\pi r sin (omega t + pi r). So J = 0.01 e^{π r} sin(ωt + π r). Wait, so the exponent is e^{π r}, and the phase inside the sine is ωt + π r. Hmm, so the sine term is sin(ωt + π r). That complicates things because now J is a function of both r and t, with a phase that depends on r.

Wait, but when calculating the average power, the time average of J² would involve the square of sin(ωt + π r). So, the average of sin²(ωt + π r) over time is 1/2, regardless of r. So the average J² is (0.01 e^{π r})^2 * (1/2) = 0.00005 e^{2π r}.

So the average power per unit volume is 0.00005 e^{2π r} / (1.57e5) = 0.00005 / 1.57e5 * e^{2π r} = approximately 3.184e-10 e^{2π r}.

Now, integrating this over the cross-sectional area:

P/L = ∫ (3.184e-10 e^{2π r}) * 2π r dr from 0 to 2.1

Which is 2π * 3.184e-10 ∫ r e^{2π r} dr from 0 to 2.1.

As before, the integral ∫ r e^{2π r} dr from 0 to 2.1 is approximately 1.5e5, leading to P/L ≈ 6.2832 * 3.184e-10 * 1.5e5 ≈ 3.01e-4 W/cm, which is 301 microW/cm. But the options are much lower. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different expression for J. Let me read the problem again.

The problem says J = 0.01e^pir sin(omegat + pir). So, perhaps it's J = 0.01 * e^{i π r} * sin(ωt + π r). But that would be a complex expression, which doesn't make sense for current density.

Alternatively, perhaps it's J = 0.01 * e^{π r} * sin(ωt + π r). Wait, but that's what I've been using.

Alternatively, perhaps the exponent is e^{π} multiplied by r, so J = 0.01 * e^{π} * r * sin(ωt + π r). So, let's recalculate with this assumption.

If J = 0.01 * e^{π} * r * sin(...), then e^{π} ≈ 23.14, so J = 0.01 * 23.14 * r * sin(...) = 0.2314 r sin(...).

So J(r,t) = 0.2314 r sin(ωt + π r).

Now, average J² is (0.2314)^2 * r² * (1/2) = (0.05358) * r² * 0.5 = 0.02679 r².

Power per unit volume is J² / σ = 0.02679 r² / 1.57e5 ≈ 1.708e-7 r².

Now, P/L is ∫ (1.708e-7 r²) * 2π r dr from 0 to 2.1.

= 2π * 1.708e-7 ∫ r^3 dr from 0 to 2.1.

∫ r^3 dr = (r^4)/4 evaluated from 0 to 2.1 → (2.1)^4 /4 ≈ (19.4481)/4 ≈ 4.862.

So,

P/L = 2π * 1.708e-7 * 4.862 ≈ 6.2832 * 1.708e-7 * 4.862

First, 6.2832 * 1.708e-7 ≈ 1.072e-6.

Then, 1.072e-6 * 4.862 ≈ 5.24e-6 W/cm = 5.24 microW/cm.

Looking at the options, option H is 3.31 microW/cm, which is close but not exact. Maybe I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, let me recalculate:

J = 0.01 * e^{π} * r = 0.01 * 23.14 * r ≈ 0.2314 r.

Average J² = (0.2314 r)^2 * 1/2 = (0.05358 r²) * 0.5 = 0.02679 r².

Power per unit volume = 0.02679 r² / 1.57e5 ≈ 1.709e-7 r².

Integrate over area: ∫ 1.709e-7 r² * 2π r dr from 0 to 2.1.

= 2π * 1.709e-7 ∫ r^3 dr from 0 to 2.1.

∫ r^3 dr = (2.1)^4 /4 = 19.4481 /4 ≈ 4.862.

So,

P/L = 2π * 1.709e-7 * 4.862 ≈ 6.2832 * 1.709e-7 * 4.862.

Compute 6.2832 * 4.862 ≈ 30.62.

Then 30.62 * 1.709e-7 ≈ 5.23e-6 W/cm = 5.23 microW/cm.

Looking at the options, the closest is option H:3.31, option G:5.06, option E:4.15. Hmm, none exactly match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using J = 0.01 e^{i π r} sin(ωt + π r), but that would complicate things with complex numbers, which doesn't make sense for power calculations. Alternatively, perhaps the exponent is e^{i π r}, but that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the formula for power. Let me think again.

Power per unit length is (J^2 / σ) integrated over the cross-section. But wait, J is a vector, and power is dot product of E and J. Wait, no, in this case, since the current is sinusoidal, the average power is indeed (J² / σ) averaged over time, integrated over the cross-section.

Wait, but another approach: since the current is sinusoidal, the instantaneous power is P = J^2 / σ, and the average power is the time average of that. So, average P/L is ∫ (average J² / σ) dA.

So, average J² is (0.01 e^{π r})^2 * (1/2) = 0.00005 e^{2π r}.

So, average power per unit volume is 0.00005 e^{2π r} / 1.57e5 ≈ 3.19e-10 e^{2π r}.

Now, P/L is ∫ (3.19e-10 e^{2π r}) * 2π r dr from 0 to 2.1.

As before, this integral seems to give a very high value, which doesn't match the options. So perhaps the initial assumption about the exponent is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended J to be J = 0.01 e^{i π r} sin(ωt + π r), but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the exponent is e^{π r}, but with r in meters, but the problem states r is in cm. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the current density is J = 0.01 e^{π r} sin(ωt + π r), but when r is in centimeters, the exponent is manageable. Let me compute e^{π * 2.1} ≈ e^{6.597} ≈ 700. So J would be 0.01 * 700 * sin(...) ≈ 7 A/cm². That's very high, but let's proceed.

Then, average J² is (0.01 e^{π r})^2 * 0.5 = 0.00005 e^{2π r}.

Power per unit volume is 0.00005 e^{2π r} / 1.57e5 ≈ 3.19e-10 e^{2π r}.

Integrate over area: 2π ∫ r * 3.19e-10 e^{2π r} dr from 0 to 2.1.

But this integral is 2π * 3.19e-10 * [e^{2π r} (2π r -1)/(2π)^2) ] from 0 to 2.1.

Wait, maybe I should compute it numerically.

Let me compute the integral ∫ r e^{2π r} dr from 0 to 2.1.

Using a calculator, ∫ r e^{a r} dr from 0 to b is (e^{a b} (a b - 1 + a)) / a².

Wait, no, the correct formula is ∫ r e^{a r} dr = (e^{a r} (a r - 1 )) / a² + C.

So, from 0 to 2.1:

[e^{2π*2.1} (2π*2.1 - 1)] / (2π)^2 - [e^0 (0 - 1)] / (2π)^2

= [e^{4.2π} (4.2π - 1)] / (4π²) - [ (-1) ] / (4π² )

= [e^{4.2π} (4.2π - 1) + 1 ] / (4π²)

As before, e^{4.2π} is about 4.85e5.

So,

Numerator ≈ 4.85e5 * (13.1946 - 1) + 1 ≈ 4.85e5 * 12.1946 ≈ 5.93e6 + 1 ≈ 5.93e6.

Denominator ≈ 4 * (9.8696) ≈ 39.478.

So the integral ≈ 5.93e6 / 39.478 ≈ 1.50e5.

So P/L ≈ 2π * 3.19e-10 * 1.50e5 ≈ 6.2832 * 3.19e-10 * 1.5e5.

Calculate 6.2832 * 3.19e-10 ≈ 2.009e-9.

Then, 2.009e-9 * 1.5e5 ≈ 3.0135e-4 W/cm = 301.35 microW/cm.

But the options don't go that high. So I must have made a wrong assumption somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended J to be J = 0.01 e^{i π r} sin(ωt + π r), but that's not physically meaningful. Alternatively, perhaps the exponent is e^{π r} but r is in meters, but the problem states r is in cm.

Alternatively, perhaps the original expression is J = 0.01 e^{π r} sin(ωt + π). That would make the phase independent of r, which is more manageable.

Wait, let me check the problem again: it says J = 0.01e^\pi r sin (omega t + pi r). So the exponent is e^{pi r}, and the phase is omega t + pi r.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase is omega t plus pi times r, but that's what I've been using.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the exponent is e^{i pi r}, but that's not likely. Alternatively, perhaps the exponent is e^{pi} * r, which would make J = 0.01 e^{pi} r sin(...), which is 0.2314 r sin(...), as I calculated earlier, leading to about 5.23 microW/cm.

Looking back, the options are:

A:6.28, B:2.44, C:31.8, D:12.2, E:4.15, F:8.75, G:5.06, H:3.31, I:9.67, J:1.59.

So 5.23 isn't an option, but option G is 5.06, which is close. Maybe I made a calculation error.

Wait, let's recompute with J = 0.01 e^{pi} r = 0.2314 r.

Average J² = (0.2314 r)^2 * 0.5 = 0.05358 r² * 0.5 = 0.02679 r².

Power per unit volume = 0.02679 r² / 1.57e5 ≈ 1.708e-7 r².

P/L = ∫ (1.708e-7 r²) * 2π r dr from 0 to 2.1.

= 2π * 1.708e-7 ∫ r^3 dr from 0 to 2.1.

∫ r^3 dr from 0 to 2.1 = (2.1)^4 /4 = (19.4481)/4 ≈4.862.

So,

P/L ≈ 6.2832 * 1.708e-7 *4.862.

Compute 6.2832 *4.862 ≈ 30.62.

Then, 30.62 *1.708e-7 ≈ 5.23e-6 W/cm =5.23 microW/cm.

Hmm, but option G is 5.06, which is very close. So perhaps the intended answer is option G:5.06 microW/cm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me recalculate more accurately.

Compute 0.01 * e^{pi} = 0.01 * 23.1407 ≈ 0.231407.

J = 0.231407 r sin(omega t + pi r).

Average J² = (0.231407 r)^2 * 0.5 = (0.053573 r²) * 0.5 = 0.0267865 r².

Power per unit volume = 0.0267865 r² / 1.57e5 = 0.0267865 / 1.57e5 r² ≈ 1.708e-7 r².

Integrate over the area: ∫ (1.708e-7 r²) * 2π r dr from 0 to 2.1.

= 2π *1.708e-7 ∫ r^3 dr from 0 to 2.1.

= 2π *1.708e-7 * (2.1)^4 /4.

(2.1)^4 = (2.1)^2 * (2.1)^2 = 4.41 *4.41 = 19.4481.

So,

= 2π *1.708e-7 * (19.4481/4) = 2π *1.708e-7 *4.862025.

Compute 2π ≈6.283185.

6.283185 *4.862025 ≈30.62.

Now, 30.62 *1.708e-7 ≈5.231e-6 W/cm =5.231 microW/cm.

So the closest option is G:5.06 microW/cm, but perhaps the exact calculation would give a slightly different value.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the integral calculation. Let me compute the integral more accurately.

Compute ∫ r^3 dr from 0 to 2.1 = (2.1)^4 /4 = (19.4481)/4 =4.862025.

Then, 2π *1.708e-7 *4.862025.

Compute 2π *4.862025 ≈6.283185 *4.862025 ≈30.62.

30.62 *1.708e-7 = (30.62 *1.708) * 1e-7.

30.62 *1.708 ≈52.31.

So 52.31e-7 =5.231e-6 W/cm =5.231 microW/cm.

So, since option G is 5.06, perhaps the intended answer is G.

To determine the dissipated power per centimeter of length for the given brass rod, we analyze the sinusoidal current density \( J(r, t) = 0.01e^{\pi r} \sin(\omega t + \pi r) \) and integrate the power dissipation over the cross-sectional area. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Power per Unit Volume**:  
   The average power per unit volume is given by \( \frac{J^2}{\sigma} \), where \( \sigma = 1.57 \times 10^5 \, \text{S/cm} \).  
   The average of \( \sin^2(\omega t + \pi r) \) over time is \( \frac{1}{2} \), so:  
   \[
   \text{Average } J^2 = (0.01e^{\pi r})^2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 0.00005e^{2\pi r}.
   \]  
   Thus, the power per unit volume is:  
   \[
   \frac{0.00005e^{2\pi r}}{1.57 \times 10^5} \approx 3.19 \times 10^{-10}e^{2\pi r}.
   \]

2. **Power per Unit Length**:  
   The total power per unit length is obtained by integrating the power per unit volume over the cross-sectional area. Using polar coordinates (\( dA = 2\pi r \, dr \)):  
   \[
   P/L = \int_0^{2.1} 3.19 \times 10^{-10}e^{2\pi r} \cdot 2\pi r \, dr.
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   P/L = 2\pi \cdot 3.19 \times 10^{-10} \int_0^{2.1} r e^{2\pi r} \, dr.
   \]

3. **Evaluating the Integral**:  
   The integral \( \int_0^{2.1} r e^{2\pi r} \, dr \) is computed using integration by parts or numerical methods. The result is approximately \( 1.5 \times 10^5 \). Substituting back:  
   \[
   P/L \approx 2\pi \cdot 3.19 \times 10^{-10} \cdot 1.5 \times 10^5 \approx 3.01 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{W/cm} = 301 \, \mu\text{W/cm}.
   \]  
   This value is inconsistent with the provided answer options, suggesting a potential misinterpretation of the current density expression.

4. **Revisiting the Current Density**:  
   If the current density is instead \( J(r, t) = 0.01e^{\pi} r \sin(\omega t + \pi r) \), where \( e^{\pi} \approx 23.14 \), the average \( J^2 \) becomes:  
   \[
   \text{Average } J^2 = (0.2314r)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 0.02679r^2.
   \]  
   The power per unit volume is then:  
   \[
   \frac{0.02679r^2}{1.57 \times 10^5} \approx 1.708 \times 10^{-7}r^2.
   \]  
   Integrating over the cross-sectional area:  
   \[
   P/L = \int_0^{2.1} 1.708 \times 10^{-7}r^2 \cdot 2\pi r \, dr = 2\pi \cdot 1.708 \times 10^{-7} \int_0^{2.1} r^3 \, dr.
   \]  
   The integral \( \int_0^{2.1} r^3 \, dr = \frac{(2.1)^4}{4} \approx 4.862 \). Substituting back:  
   \[
   P/L \approx 2\pi \cdot 1.708 \times 10^{-7} \cdot 4.862 \approx 5.23 \, \mu\text{W/cm}.
   \]  
   The closest answer option is **G: 5.06 \(\mu\text{W/cm}\)**.

**Answer:**  
G
