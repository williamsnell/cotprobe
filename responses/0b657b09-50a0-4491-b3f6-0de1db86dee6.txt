Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about familial hypercholesterolaemia. I'm a bit rusty on my genetics and biochemistry, but I'll try to think this through step by step.

First, I remember that familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a genetic disorder that leads to high levels of cholesterol in the blood, specifically LDL cholesterol. It's a condition that runs in families and can cause early-onset heart disease if not managed.

The question is asking which gene mutation causes FH. The options are various proteins and enzymes involved in lipid metabolism. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Low density lipoprotein. Wait, LDL is a type of lipoprotein, not a gene. So the gene would code for something else, maybe a receptor for LDL. So probably not A.

Option B: High density lipoprotein. HDL is another type of lipoprotein. FH is about high LDL, so HDL might be involved in the opposite, maybe lowering cholesterol. But I think the main issue in FH is the inability to clear LDL from the blood, so maybe not B either.

Option C: Low density lipoprotein receptor. That sounds promising. The LDL receptor is responsible for binding LDL particles and removing them from the blood. If there's a mutation in this receptor, the body can't clear LDL effectively, leading to high cholesterol levels. I've heard that FH is often due to mutations in the LDL receptor gene. So C is a strong candidate.

Option D: Triglyceride lipase. I'm not too sure, but I think this enzyme breaks down triglycerides. FH is mainly about LDL, so maybe this isn't the primary issue here.

Option E: Apolipoprotein E. ApoE is involved in cholesterol transport and is a component of various lipoproteins. Mutations in ApoE can cause other lipid disorders, like certain types of hyperlipidemia, but I'm not sure if it's the main cause of FH.

Option F: HMG-CoA reductase. This enzyme is a key point in cholesterol synthesis. Statins target this enzyme. But FH isn't about cholesterol synthesis per se; it's more about clearance. So probably not F.

Option G: Lipoprotein lipase. LPL is involved in the breakdown of triglycerides in VLDL. If LPL is deficient, you get issues with triglycerides, like in familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency, which causes high triglycerides, not necessarily high LDL. So G might not be it.

Option H: Apolipoprotein B. ApoB is a protein on LDL particles. Maybe mutations here could affect LDL function, but I think the main FH cause is the receptor. ApoB mutations might lead to other issues, like LDL not binding properly, but I'm not certain if this is the primary gene involved in FH.

Option I: Acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase. This enzyme is involved in cholesterol esterification in cells. If it's defective, maybe cholesterol can't be stored properly, but I don't think this leads to high serum LDL like in FH.

Option J: Cholesterol ester transfer protein. CETP is involved in transferring cholesterol esters between lipoproteins. Mutations here might affect HDL levels, perhaps, but FH is mainly about LDL. So J might not be the right answer.

Putting it all together, the LDL receptor is the key here. When the receptor isn't working properly, the body can't remove LDL from the blood, leading to high cholesterol levels and the risk of cardiovascular disease. So the correct answer should be option C.
