Question:

 In response to the argument that embryos are not persons because they do not exercise higher mental capacities, Lee and George argue that

Options:

A: it doesn't make sense to say that a person exercises higher mental capacities.
B: mental capacities should not be a factor in determining personhood.
C: the ability to exercise higher mental capacities could be considered a potential, not an actuality.
D: to have killed a human embryos that developed into you would have been the same thing as killing you.
E: embryos actually do exercise higher mental capacities.
F: higher mental capacities are not the only defining characteristics of a person.
G: they dispute the notion that higher mental capacities are a requirement for personhood.
H: the argument is irrelevant as they believe life begins at conception.
I: embryos are potential persons and therefore should have the same rights.
J: the argument is sound, but its validity fails due to a common logical fallacy.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about Lee and George's argument regarding embryos and personhood. Let's break it down step by step.

The question is asking what Lee and George argue in response to the argument that embryos aren't persons because they don't exercise higher mental capacities. The options are from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I should understand the context. The argument presented is that embryos aren't persons because they lack higher mental capacities. So the opposing view is probably arguing that personhood requires certain mental abilities, and embryos don't have them yet.

Now, Lee and George are likely philosophers or ethicists who have written on this topic. From what I remember, in debates about abortion and embryo ethics, the issue often comes down to when personhood begins and what defines a person.

The options given are various arguments they might make. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A says it doesn't make sense to say a person exercises higher mental capacities. That seems a bit vague. Maybe they're saying the premise is flawed, but I'm not sure.

Option B suggests that mental capacities shouldn't be a factor. That would mean personhood isn't tied to mental abilities at all, which is a strong statement. I'm not certain if that's what Lee and George argue.

Option C talks about potential versus actuality. So they might be saying that while embryos don't currently have higher mental capacities, they have the potential to develop them. That sounds familiar because I've heard arguments about potential in ethical discussions, like how embryos are potential people.

Option D is about killing embryos being the same as killing someone later. This seems like the "future person" argument, where harming an embryo is like harming someone who will exist in the future. I think this is a common argument but not sure if it's what they're addressing here.

Option E claims embryos do have higher mental capacities. This would directly counter the original argument, but I don't think that's accurate because embryos in the early stages don't have developed brains.

Option F says higher mental capacities aren't the only defining characteristics. That could be true, but the question is about their response to the specific argument against embryos being persons based on lacking these capacities.

Option G disputes the notion that higher mental capacities are required for personhood. So they're arguing against the premise that mental capacities are necessary for personhood, which would be a direct response.

Option H states the argument is irrelevant because they believe life begins at conception. This is more about when life starts rather than the mental capacities aspect, so maybe not the direct response.

Option I says embryos are potential persons and have rights. This ties back to the potential argument again, similar to option C but more about rights.

Option J claims the argument is sound but fails due to a logical fallacy. That would mean the original argument is correct, but the reasoning is flawed. Not sure if that's the case here.

Now, putting it together. The original argument is that embryos aren't persons because they lack higher mental capacities. Lee and George are responding to this. If they agree that higher mental capacities are important but think the argument is flawed, they might point out that potential matters.

Option C says the ability to exercise higher mental capacities is a potential, not an actuality. So they're arguing that even though embryos don't have these capacities now, they have the potential to develop them, making them more than just non-persons.

Alternatively, Option G says they dispute that higher mental capacities are a requirement. So they might argue that personhood doesn't require those capacities in the first place.

Which one is more likely? I think the potential argument is more about the timing or the process, whereas G is about the criteria for personhood. The question is about their response to the argument about mental capacities, so they might be challenging the requirement aspect.

Wait, but another angle: the argument presented is that because embryos don't exercise higher mental capacities, they aren't persons. Lee and George might counter by saying that potential matters, so even without current capacities, the potential makes them persons. That would align with option C.

Alternatively, they could argue that the requirement for mental capacities is wrong, which is option G.

I think I need to recall if Lee and George specifically make the potential argument. From what I remember, in discussions like this, the potential for development is a key point. For example, in the debate over embryo research, some argue that embryos have potential that should be respected.

So, in this case, Lee and George would likely argue that the potential to develop higher mental capacities is what matters, not the current exercise of them. That would make option C correct.

Wait, but another thought: if they argue that higher mental capacities aren't required for personhood, that would also be a strong counter. So perhaps they take that stance.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me think again. The question is about their response to the argument that embryos aren't persons because they lack higher mental capacities.

If they accept that higher mental capacities are relevant but say that potential is key, that's option C. If they reject the idea that higher mental capacities are required for personhood, that's G.

I think the answer is G because they are disputing the notion that higher mental capacities are a requirement. So they would say that even if embryos don't have them, they are still persons. Alternatively, they might be making a different point.

Wait, another angle: the argument is that embryos don't exercise higher mental capacities, so they aren't persons. Lee and George might respond that the exercise isn't the issue but the potential is. So that would point to option C.

Alternatively, they might say that higher mental capacities aren't the only defining characteristics, which is option F. But the question is about the specific argument about mental capacities.

I think the key is that the argument is based on the lack of current mental capacities, and Lee and George would argue that potential is what's important. So option C: the ability is a potential, not an actuality.

Yes, that makes sense. They're countering by saying it's not about current exercise but the potential to develop.

The argument presented is that embryos are not persons because they lack higher mental capacities. Lee and George respond by emphasizing the potential for higher mental capacities rather than their current exercise. They argue that the ability to develop these capacities is what matters, not the immediate possession of them. This aligns with option C, which highlights the distinction between potential and actuality. 

Answer: C
