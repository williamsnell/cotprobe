Okay, so I need to figure out how Homo erectus differed from Homo habilis. I'm a bit rusty on my prehistory, but I'll try to recall what I know.

First, I remember that both Homo erectus and Homo habilis are early human ancestors, part of the genus Homo. I think Homo habilis was one of the first, maybe around 2.5 million years ago. Homo erectus came later, perhaps around 1.8 million years ago. So, H. erectus is more evolved or at least a later species.

I think Homo habilis is often called "handy man" because they were the first to use tools, specifically Oldowan tools, which are simple stone tools used for cutting and scraping. But wait, wasn't H. erectus also tool users? Oh right, they made more advanced tools, like Acheulean tools, which were more sophisticated, such as bifaces (hand axes). So, both used tools, but H. erectus had better tools. That might not be the difference listed here.

Looking at the options, option B says Erectus wasn't capable of using tools. That can't be right because I'm pretty sure they were tool users. So B is incorrect.

Option E says Erectus had a larger brain. I think that's correct. Homo erectus had a larger braincase than H. habilis. H. habilis had a brain size around 500-600 cubic centimeters, while H. erectus had about 900-1100. So E is a likely correct answer.

Option I says Erectus had a smaller brain. That's the opposite of E, so I is wrong.

Option G says Erectus had a smaller body size. Wait, I think H. erectus was actually taller and larger in body size than H. habilis. H. habilis was shorter and smaller, so G is incorrect.

Looking at other options: A says Erectus wasn't bipedal. No, both were bipedal. Bipedalism is a key trait of hominids, so A is wrong.

Option C: Erectus was primarily herbivorous. I'm not sure about their diet. I know they were hunters and probably more omnivorous, maybe more meat than habilis? Or maybe both were similar. I'm not confident about this one. I'll come back to it.

Option D: Erectus fossils only in Africa. No, I think H. erectus fossils have been found in Africa, Eurasia, and other parts. For example, Java man in Indonesia and Peking man in China. So D is wrong.

Option H: Fossils only in Europe. No, same as D, but Europe is only a subset; H is wrong.

Option F: Relatively short-lived species. I think H. erectus lived for a long time, maybe over a million years, so F is incorrect.

Option J: Shorter lifespan. I don't have info on lifespans, but I don't think lifespan is a key distinguishing factor between these species. Plus, without data, it's hard to say. So probably not J.

So, the main differences I can remember are brain size and tool use. Since E is about a larger brain, that's correct. Also, body size: H. erectus was larger, so G is incorrect.

Wait, another thought: H. habilis is considered more primitive, smaller brain and body, while H. erectus is more advanced, bigger in both. So E is correct.

So the answer should be E.

The correct answer is E: Erectus possessed a larger brain.
