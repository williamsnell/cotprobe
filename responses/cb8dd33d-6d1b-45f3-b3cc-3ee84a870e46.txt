Okay, so I've got this statistics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about statistical significance and power in a study. The setup says the criterion for significance is 0.05, and the statistical power is 0.85. The options are A through J, each making a statement about type I and type II errors or statistical power.

First, I need to remember what these terms mean. The criterion for statistical significance, usually denoted as alpha (α), is the probability of committing a type I error. A type I error is when we incorrectly reject a true null hypothesis. So, if α is 0.05, that means there's a 5% chance of making a type I error.

Statistical power is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis. It's denoted as 1 - beta (β), where beta is the probability of a type II error, which is failing to reject a false null hypothesis. So, if the power is 0.85, that means beta is 1 - 0.85 = 0.15. So, the probability of a type II error is 15%.

Now, let's look at the options:

A: The statistical power of the study is less than the criterion for statistical significance. Well, power is 0.85, and the significance level is 0.05. 0.85 is greater than 0.05, so A is wrong.

B: The probability of making a type II error is 0.85. No, because we just calculated beta as 0.15, so B is incorrect.

C: The probability of making a type II error is 0.05. No, that's the significance level (alpha), not beta. So C is wrong.

D: The probability of type I and type II errors cannot be computed from the information given. Wait, we do know alpha is 0.05 (type I error) and beta is 0.15 (type II error). So D is incorrect because we can compute them.

E: The probability of making a type I and type II error is equal. No, because 0.05 and 0.15 are not equal. So E is wrong.

F: The probability of making a type I error is 0.85. No, alpha is 0.05, so F is incorrect.

G: The probability of making a type I error is lower than the probability of making a type II error. Let's see: Type I error is 0.05, type II is 0.15. So 0.05 < 0.15. Yes, that's true. So G could be correct.

H: The probability of making a type II error is higher than the probability of making a type I error. Wait, that's the same as G but reversed. Since 0.15 > 0.05, H is also correct. Wait, but the options can't both be correct, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, no. Let me double-check. Type I error is 0.05, type II is 0.15. So H says type II is higher than type I. Yes, that's correct. So H is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought G was correct. Hmm, I need to check the options again. Oh wait, the options are separate, so both G and H can't be correct because the question is multiple choice with one right answer.

Wait, let me think again. The question is asking which statement is correct based on the given info. So both G and H are making statements about the relative probabilities. Let me check the actual options again.

Looking back, the options are:

G: The probability of making a type I error is lower than the probability of making a type II error. Since 0.05 < 0.15, this is true.

H: The probability of making a type II error is higher than the probability of making a type I error. That's also true because 0.15 > 0.05.

Wait, but how can both G and H be correct? That can't be. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me look again.

Wait, the options are:

G: ... is lower than

H: ... is higher than

So, both G and H are correct. But in a multiple-choice question, only one can be the correct answer. So perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the options.

Wait, no, the options are separate. Let me check the actual options again.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct. So, if both G and H are correct, but that's impossible, then perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier reasoning.

Wait, no, because the options are separate, and only one is correct. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the probabilities. Type I error is alpha (0.05), and type II error is beta (0.15). So, type I error probability is 5%, type II is 15%.

So, G says type I is lower than type II. That's correct because 0.05 < 0.15. H says type II is higher than type I, which is also correct because 0.15 > 0.05.

Wait, but in the options, both G and H would be correct, which can't be the case. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options.

Wait, looking back at the options:

G: The probability of making a type I error is lower than the probability of making a type II error.

H: The probability of making a type II error is higher than the probability of making a type I error.

Yes, both G and H are correct. But in a standard multiple-choice question, only one can be correct. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the options are phrased differently. Let me check again.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about which of the options is correct. So, perhaps both G and H are correct, but looking at the options, I might have to see which one is present.

Wait, looking at the given options, the correct answer should be I: The probability of making a type I error is 0.15. Wait, no, because alpha is 0.05. Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, no, the power is 0.85, which is 1 - beta, so beta is 0.15. So type II error is 0.15, type I is 0.05.

So, looking at the options, I: The probability of making a type I error is 0.15. No, that's incorrect because type I is 0.05. So I is wrong.

Wait, then G and H are both correct. But that's impossible. So perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the options.

Wait, perhaps the options are:

Looking again at the options:

I: The probability of making a type I error is 0.15. No, that's wrong.

J: The statistical power of the study is equal to the criterion for statistical significance. Power is 0.85, significance level is 0.05. So J is incorrect.

Wait, so going back, the correct options would be G and H. But in reality, in the given options, only one can be correct.

Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check again.

Looking at the options:

G: The probability of making a type I error is lower than the probability of making a type II error.

H: The probability of making a type II error is higher than the probability of making a type I error.

So both G and H are correct, but in the options, perhaps only one is presented. Wait, the question gives options A to J, each as a separate choice.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me check again.

Alpha is 0.05 → type I error probability is 5%.

Power is 0.85 → beta is 0.15 → type II error probability is 15%.

So, yes, type I error is lower than type II error. So G is correct.

H is also correct because type II error is higher than type I.

Wait, but in the options, both G and H are present. How is that possible? Perhaps the question expects only one correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me look again.

Wait, the options are:

G: The probability of making a type I error is lower than the probability of making a type II error.

H: The probability of making a type II error is higher than the probability of making a type I error.

So both G and H are correct. But in the given options, perhaps only one is correct. But how?

Wait, perhaps the options are not both correct. Let me think again.

If alpha is 0.05 and beta is 0.15, then type I error is 5%, type II is 15%. So, type I is lower than type II. So G is correct.

H says type II is higher than type I, which is also correct. So both G and H are correct statements.

But in the options, I don't see both being correct. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is to choose the correct statement, and both G and H are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I: The probability of making a type I error is 0.15. No, that's wrong because alpha is 0.05.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me list the correct probabilities:

Type I error (alpha) = 0.05

Type II error (beta) = 0.15

Power = 0.85

Now, looking at the options:

A: Power < alpha → 0.85 < 0.05 → No.

B: Beta = 0.85 → No, beta is 0.15.

C: Beta = 0.05 → No.

D: Can't compute type I and II errors → No, we can compute them.

E: Type I = Type II → 0.05 vs 0.15 → No.

F: Type I = 0.85 → No.

G: Type I < Type II → 0.05 < 0.15 → Yes.

H: Type II > Type I → 0.15 > 0.05 → Yes.

I: Type I = 0.15 → No.

J: Power = alpha → 0.85 vs 0.05 → No.

So both G and H are correct. But in the options, only one can be correct. So perhaps the question is designed such that only one is correct, but in reality, both G and H are correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm misreading the options. Let me check again.

Wait, the options are:

G: The probability of making a type I error is lower than the probability of making a type II error.

H: The probability of making a type II error is higher than the probability of making a type I error.

So both G and H are correct, but the options don't allow for that. So perhaps the correct answer is either G or H, but in reality, both are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps only one of them is presented as an option, and the other is not. But in the given options, both G and H are present.

Wait, perhaps the question is from a source where only one is correct. So perhaps the intended answer is G, because it directly states that type I is lower, which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is I, but that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again.

No, I think the correct answer is that both G and H are correct, but since the options don't allow for that, perhaps the intended answer is G.

But wait, the options include G and H, so perhaps both are correct, but the question expects only one. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps only one of them is correct. Let me think about the options again.

Wait, perhaps the question is designed so that only one is correct. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier reasoning.

Wait, no, because type I is 0.05 and type II is 0.15, so both G and H are correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see that G is correct, and H is also correct. But in the options, perhaps only G is presented, but in the given options, both G and H are present.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is G and H, but since the options are separate, perhaps the answer is G and H. But in the given options, only one can be selected.

Hmm, this is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I: The probability of making a type I error is 0.15. But that's wrong because alpha is 0.05.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

The correct answer is that type I error is 0.05, type II is 0.15. So G is correct (type I < type II), and H is also correct (type II > type I). But in the options, both G and H are present, so perhaps the intended answer is G.

But wait, perhaps the options are not both correct, and I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the power being 0.85, which is higher than the significance level of 0.05. So statistical power is higher than alpha, meaning that the study is well-powered.

But that's not directly answering the question about the probabilities of type I and II errors.

So, going back, the correct statements are G and H. But since the options don't allow for that, perhaps the intended answer is G.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is G, because type I error is lower than type II error.

Yes, I think that's the correct approach. So the answer should be G.

The question involves understanding the relationships between statistical significance, power, and type I and type II errors. The criterion for statistical significance (α) is 0.05, and the statistical power is 0.85. Statistical power is defined as 1 - β, where β is the probability of a type II error. Therefore, β = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15. This means the probability of a type I error is 0.05, and the probability of a type II error is 0.15.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect, as power (0.85) is greater than α (0.05).
- **B**: Incorrect, as β is 0.15, not 0.85.
- **C**: Incorrect, as β is 0.15, not 0.05.
- **D**: Incorrect, as α (0.05) and β (0.15) can be computed.
- **E**: Incorrect, as α (0.05) and β (0.15) are not equal.
- **F**: Incorrect, as α is 0.05, not 0.85.
- **G**: Correct, as α (0.05) is lower than β (0.15).
- **H**: Correct, as β (0.15) is higher than α (0.05).
- **I**: Incorrect, as α is 0.05, not 0.15.
- **J**: Incorrect, as power (0.85) is not equal to α (0.05).

Both **G** and **H** are correct statements, but since only one answer can be selected, the most direct and appropriate choice is **G**, which states that the probability of a type I error is lower than that of a type II error.

**Answer: G**
