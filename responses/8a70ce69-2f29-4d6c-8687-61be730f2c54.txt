Okay, so I've got this equation here: 12 minus 9 plus c equals 12. I need to find the value of c that makes this equation true. Let me think about how to approach this step by step.

First, I'll rewrite the equation to make it clearer. So, it's 12 - 9 + c = 12. I remember that when solving for a variable, I should try to isolate it on one side of the equation. 

Let me start by simplifying the left side of the equation. 12 minus 9 is 3, right? So that simplifies the equation to 3 + c = 12. Now, I need to solve for c. To do that, I'll subtract 3 from both sides of the equation to get c by itself.

So, subtracting 3 from both sides: 3 + c - 3 = 12 - 3. On the left side, 3 minus 3 cancels out, leaving just c. And on the right side, 12 minus 3 is 9. So, c equals 9. 

Wait, let me double-check that. If I plug c = 9 back into the original equation, does it hold true? Let's see: 12 - 9 + 9 equals 12. 12 minus 9 is 3, plus 9 is 12. Yep, that adds up to 12 on both sides. So, c must be 9.

Looking at the options, I see that option I is 9. So, the correct answer should be I.

The equation simplifies to 3 + c = 12, so c = 9. Answer: I.
