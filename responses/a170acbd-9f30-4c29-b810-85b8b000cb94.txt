Okay, so I've got this problem in front of me about finding the molecular mass of a gas. Hmm, the given data includes density, temperature, and pressure. I remember that density relates to mass and volume, and since it's a gas, I probably need to use the ideal gas law here. Let me think through the steps.

First, the density is 2.05 g/L. Density is mass over volume, so that means in one liter of the gas, there are 2.05 grams. So, the mass (m) is 2.05 g, and the volume (V) is 1 L. 

I recall that the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. But I need to relate this to molecular mass. Oh right, molecular mass (M) is mass (m) divided by moles (n). So, M = m/n. Rearranging the gas law, n = PV/(RT). So substituting that into M, we get M = mRT/(PV). 

Wait, but m is 2.05 g and V is 1 L, right? So m/V would be the density, which is 2.05 g/L. So maybe I can write the formula as M = (density × R × T) / (P). That makes sense because m/V is density, and P is pressure.

Now, I need to convert the pressure from torr to atmospheres because the gas constant R is usually in terms of atm. I remember that 1 atm is 760 torr, so 722 torr divided by 760 torr/atm gives me the pressure in atm. Let me calculate that: 722 / 760 ≈ 0.950 atm.

Temperature is given in Celsius, so I have to convert that to Kelvin. 26.0 °C plus 273.15 is 299.15 K.

Now, plug the numbers into the formula. M = (density × R × T) / P. R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), I think. So putting it all together:

Density is 2.05 g/L, R is 0.0821, T is 299.15 K, P is 0.950 atm.

Calculating numerator: 2.05 * 0.0821 * 299.15. Let me compute that step by step. 2.05 * 0.0821 is approximately 0.168205. Then multiply by 299.15: 0.168205 * 300 is about 50.4615, but since it's 299.15, it's a bit less, maybe around 50.4 g/mol?

Wait, no, wait. Let me do the exact calculation. 2.05 * 0.0821 = let's see: 2 * 0.0821 is 0.1642, 0.05 *0.0821 is 0.004105. So total is 0.168305. Then multiply by 299.15.

Hmm, 0.168305 * 300 is 50.4915, but since it's 299.15, that's 299.15 = 300 - 0.85. So 0.168305 * (300 - 0.85) = 50.4915 - (0.168305 * 0.85). 0.168305 * 0.85 is approximately 0.143059. So subtracting that from 50.4915 gives around 50.3484 g/mol.

Then, the denominator is P, which is 0.950 atm. So M = 50.3484 / 0.950 ≈ 53.0 g/mol. Wait, because 50.3484 divided by 0.95 is roughly 53. So looking at the options, option J is 53.0 g/mol. But wait, let me check my calculations again because sometimes I might have messed up.

Wait, another thought: when I calculated 2.05 * 0.0821 * 299.15, perhaps I should compute more accurately. Let me do 2.05 * 0.0821 first. 2.05 * 0.08 is 0.164, 2.05 * 0.0021 is 0.004305. So total is 0.168305. Then multiply by 299.15. Let's see: 0.168305 * 300 = 50.4915. But since it's 299.15, it's 299.15 = 300 - 0.85, so 50.4915 - (0.168305 * 0.85). 0.168305 * 0.85 is 0.143059. So 50.4915 - 0.143059 = 50.3484. Then divide by 0.950 atm: 50.3484 /0.95 ≈ 53.0.

So the molecular mass is approximately 53.0 g/mol, which is option J. But wait, looking at the options, option J is 53.0. So that's the answer.

To determine the molecular mass of the gas, we use the relationship between density, pressure, temperature, and the ideal gas law. The formula derived is:

\[
M = \frac{\text{density} \times R \times T}{P}
\]

Given:
- Density = 2.05 g/L
- Temperature = 26.0 °C = 299.15 K
- Pressure = 722 torr = 0.950 atm (converted using \(1 \, \text{atm} = 760 \, \text{torr}\))
- \(R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)}\)

Substituting the values:

\[
M = \frac{2.05 \times 0.0821 \times 299.15}{0.950}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:
\[
2.05 \times 0.0821 = 0.168305
\]
\[
0.168305 \times 299.15 \approx 50.3484
\]

Then divide by the pressure:
\[
M = \frac{50.3484}{0.950} \approx 53.0 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

Thus, the molecular mass of the gas is approximately **53.0 g/mol**, corresponding to **option J**.
