Okay, so I've got this problem about Frank Lee and Steve Barnes, who are partners. The question is asking how much each of them receives from the profits, which are $28,269. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the profit distribution rules. Barnes receives a weekly salary of $300, and then he also gets 1/3 of the remaining net income. The other 2/3 of the remaining income goes to Lee. Hmm, so Barnes has two parts: his fixed salary and a share of the leftover profits after that salary is paid.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure I get the order right. Barnes gets $300 each week as a salary. Then, whatever is left after that salary is considered the remaining net income. From this remaining amount, Barnes takes 1/3, and Lee takes 2/3. So the total profit is $28,269, but Barnes's salary is a fixed weekly amount. Wait, does that mean he gets $300 every week until the profits run out, or is it a one-time payment? Hmm, the problem says "weekly salary," but the total profit is given as $28,269. I think I should treat it as a one-time payment because the total profit is a single amount. So Barnes gets $300 as a salary, and then the rest is split.

Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me re-read the problem. It says Barnes receives a weekly salary of $300, and 1/3 of the remaining net income. So perhaps the $300 is a weekly salary, but the total profit is $28,269. So I might need to consider how many weeks are in the profit period. But the problem doesn't specify the time frame—like how many weeks the profit covers. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the $300 is a fixed amount subtracted from the total profit before splitting the rest.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to subtract Barnes's salary from the total profit first, and then split the remaining amount. So let's model it that way.

Total profit = $28,269.

First, subtract Barnes's salary. But wait, is the salary $300 per week, and the profit for how many weeks? The problem doesn't say. Hmm, this is a bit unclear. Alternatively, maybe the $300 is a fixed salary, so regardless of the time period, Barnes gets $300 as a base, and then the remaining profit is split.

Wait, but if the salary is weekly, and the total profit is $28,269, perhaps the $300 is a weekly deduction. So the number of weeks would be part of the calculation. But without knowing the number of weeks, I can't compute that. So maybe the problem is considering the salary as a one-time payment, not weekly. Alternatively, perhaps the salary is a fixed amount, so Barnes gets $300, and the rest is split as per the ratio.

Let me try that approach. So first, subtract the $300 salary from the total profit.

Remaining profit = $28,269 - $300 = $27,969.

Then, Barnes gets 1/3 of this remaining profit, and Lee gets 2/3.

So Barnes's share from the remaining profit: (1/3) * 27,969 = ?

Let me calculate that. 27,969 divided by 3 is 9,323. So Barnes gets $9,323 from the remaining profit. Plus his salary of $300, so total for Barnes is $9,323 + $300 = $9,623.

Wait, but that's not one of the options. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check my steps again.

Wait, perhaps the salary is not subtracted from the total profit first. Maybe the salary is part of the net income calculation. So the net income is calculated after subtracting all expenses, including Barnes's salary. So the total profit is $28,269, which is after all expenses, including the salary.

Wait, that might make more sense. So the $28,269 is the net income, and Barnes gets his salary from that.

So Barnes receives $300 as a weekly salary, but how does that fit into the total net income of $28,269? Is the $300 part of the net income, so when it's distributed, Barnes gets his salary, and then the remaining is split.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

Total profit = $28,269.

Barnes gets $300 as a salary, so the remaining profit is $28,269 - $300 = $27,969.

Then, from this $27,969, Barnes takes 1/3, and Lee takes 2/3.

So Barnes's total would be $300 + (1/3)*27,969.

Calculating 1/3 of 27,969: 27,969 ÷ 3 = 9,323.

So Barnes gets $300 + $9,323 = $9,623.

Lee gets 2/3 of 27,969, which is 27,969 * (2/3) = 18,646.

So Barnes: $9,623, Lee: $18,646.

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches.

Option D: Barnes: $9,423, Lee: $18,846.

Hmm, that's close but not exactly matching. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute 27,969 ÷ 3.

27,969 divided by 3:

3 into 27 is 9, 3 into 9 is 3, 3 into 6 is 2, 3 into 9 is 3. So 9,323.

So Barnes gets $300 + $9,323 = $9,623.

Lee gets 2/3 of 27,969: 27,969 * 2 = 55,938; 55,938 ÷ 3 = 18,646.

So Barnes: $9,623, Lee: $18,646.

Looking at the options, none of the options exactly match this. Let me check the options again.

Looking at option D: Barnes: $9,423, Lee: $18,846.

Hmm, that's different. Did I make a mistake in the approach?

Wait, maybe I got the order wrong. Perhaps the salary is taken after the profit split. No, the problem says Barnes receives a weekly salary of $300, and then 1/3 of the remaining net income. So the salary is first, then the remaining is split.

Alternatively, perhaps the salary is part of the net income, so the net income is $28,269, which includes Barnes's salary. So when we take away the salary, we get the remaining profit, which is split.

Wait, that's what I did earlier. So maybe I did it correctly, but perhaps the options have a different approach.

Wait, let's check option I: Barnes: $10,089, Lee: $18,180.

Wait, let's see: if Barnes gets 1/3 of 28,269 after salary.

Wait, perhaps the salary is not subtracted first. Maybe the salary is part of the profit distribution.

Wait, maybe the total profit is distributed as: first, Barnes's salary is $300, then the remaining is split.

Wait, but that would mean the remaining profit is 28,269 - 300 = 27,969, as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the $300 is a fixed amount, and then the total profit is split as follows: Barnes gets 1/3, Lee 2/3, but after subtracting the salary.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. The problem says Barnes receives a weekly salary of $300, and 1/3 of the remaining net income. So the salary is separate from the profit split.

Alternatively, perhaps the total profit is $28,269, which is after all expenses except Barnes's salary. So Barnes's salary is an expense, and the net income is $28,269 plus his salary? No, that can't be, because the profit is net income.

I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try another approach.

Let me denote the total profit as P = $28,269.

Barnes's salary is S = $300.

The remaining profit after salary is P_remaining = P - S = 28,269 - 300 = 27,969.

Then, Barnes gets 1/3 of P_remaining, and Lee gets 2/3.

So Barnes's total = S + (1/3)P_remaining = 300 + (27,969 / 3) = 300 + 9,323 = 9,623.

Lee's total = (2/3)P_remaining = (2/3)*27,969 = 18,646.

Looking at the options, none have these numbers. The closest is option D: Barnes $9,423, Lee $18,846.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

27,969 divided by 3: 3*9,000=27,000, 3*323=969. So 9,000 + 323 = 9,323. That's correct.

So Barnes gets 300 + 9,323 = 9,623.

Looking at the options again, I don't see this exact number. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, maybe the salary is not subtracted first. Maybe the salary is part of the net income, so the calculation is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the salary is considered as part of the profit distribution. So the total profit is $28,269, and Barnes's salary is $300, so the remaining is 28,269 - 300 = 27,969. Then, from this, Barnes gets 1/3, Lee 2/3.

Wait, that's what I did earlier. So maybe the answer isn't listed, but perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the salary is a fixed amount, and the profit is split after that. So the total profit is $28,269, and Barnes gets 1/3 of that, plus his salary. But that doesn't make sense because the salary is separate.

Wait, no, the problem says Barnes receives a weekly salary of $300, and 1/3 of the remaining net income. So the salary is first, then the remaining is split.

Let me try to think differently. Maybe the salary is not subtracted from the total profit but is instead a separate payment. So the total profit is $28,269, which is split as follows: Barnes gets his salary of $300 plus 1/3 of the profit, and Lee gets 2/3 of the profit.

Wait, that would be different. Let me model it that way.

So total profit P = 28,269.

Barnes's total = S + (1/3)P = 300 + (28,269 /3).

Calculating 28,269 ÷3: 3*9,000=27,000, 28,269-27,000=1,269. 1,269 ÷3=423. So 9,000 + 423 = 9,423.

So Barnes's total = 300 + 9,423 = 9,723.

Wait, that's not matching any options either. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the salary is part of the profit, so the remaining is split after paying the salary.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is:

Total profit = $28,269.

Barnes gets $300 as a salary, so the remaining is 28,269 - 300 = 27,969.

Then, from this 27,969, Barnes gets 1/3, Lee gets 2/3.

So Barnes gets 27,969 * (1/3) = 9,323.

So total for Barnes: 300 + 9,323 = 9,623.

Lee gets 27,969 * (2/3) = 18,646.

Looking at the options, none match exactly. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option D is Barnes: $9,423, Lee: $18,846.

Wait, perhaps the salary is not subtracted first. Maybe the $300 is part of the profit, and then the profit is split as Barnes gets 1/3 and Lee gets 2/3, but then the salary is subtracted from Barnes's share. That doesn't make sense, but let's try.

Total profit P = 28,269.

Barnes's share = (1/3)P = 9,423.

Lee's share = (2/3)P = 18,846.

Then, subtract the salary from Barnes's share: 9,423 - 300 = 9,123. But that's not matching any options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the salary is subtracted from the profit first, but the split is based on the original profit, not the remaining. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as:

Barnes's total = salary + 1/3 of (profit - salary).

Which is what I did earlier: 300 + (28,269 - 300)/3 = 300 + 9,323 = 9,623.

But that's not an option. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, let me check the division again: 27,969 ÷3.

27,969 ÷3:

3 into 2 is 0, carry 2.

3 into 27 is 9, 9*3=27, remainder 0.

Bring down 9: 3 into 9 is 3, 3*3=9, remainder 0.

Bring down 6: 3 into 6 is 2, 2*3=6, remainder 0.

Bring down 9: 3 into 9 is 3, 3*3=9, remainder 0.

So 9,323. That's correct.

So Barnes's total is 9,623. Lee's is 18,646.

Looking back at the options, I don't see this. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, maybe the salary is a weekly amount, and the profit is for a certain number of weeks. But the problem doesn't specify the number of weeks. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the salary is not subtracted but is part of the profit distribution. So the total profit is split as follows: Barnes gets 1/3, Lee gets 2/3, and then Barnes also gets an additional $300 as a salary.

Wait, that would mean Barnes's total is (1/3)*28,269 + $300.

Calculating (1/3)*28,269: 28,269 ÷3 = 9,423. So Barnes gets 9,423 + 300 = 9,723, and Lee gets 2/3 *28,269 = 18,846.

Looking at the options, option D is Barnes: 9,423, Lee: 18,846. But that doesn't include the extra $300 for Barnes. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the salary is part of the profit, so the total profit is $28,269, which includes the salary. So when the profit is split, Barnes's share is 1/3, and Lee's is 2/3. Then, Barnes also gets his salary from his share.

Wait, that's getting too convoluted. Maybe I should approach it differently.

Let me try to model the profit distribution as per the problem statement.

Total profit: $28,269.

Barnes receives a weekly salary of $300. So if this is for one week, then Barnes gets $300 as salary, and the remaining profit is $28,269 - $300 = $27,969.

From this remaining amount, Barnes gets 1/3, Lee gets 2/3.

So Barnes's total: 300 + (1/3)*27,969 = 300 + 9,323 = 9,623.

Lee's total: (2/3)*27,969 = 18,646.

Looking at the options, none match exactly. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that can't be the case. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option I is Barnes: $10,089, Lee: $18,180.

Hmm, 10,089 is 300 + 9,789. 9,789 is approximately 1/3 of 29,367, which is close to 28,269. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the salary is a fixed amount, and the remaining is split as 1/3 and 2/3.

Wait, maybe the total profit is split as follows: first, subtract the salary, then split the rest.

So:

Total profit: 28,269.

Subtract salary: 28,269 - 300 = 27,969.

Barnes's share: 1/3 *27,969 = 9,323.

Lee's share: 2/3 *27,969 = 18,646.

So Barnes's total is 300 + 9,323 = 9,623.

But again, no option matches. So perhaps the correct approach is different.

Wait, maybe the salary is part of the profit, so the total profit is 28,269, which includes the salary. So Barnes gets 1/3 of the total profit, and Lee gets 2/3, and then Barnes also gets his salary.

Wait, that would mean Barnes's total is (1/3)*28,269 + 300 = 9,423 + 300 = 9,723, and Lee gets 18,846.

But that's not matching any option either.

Wait, perhaps the salary is a fixed amount, and the remaining profit is split as 1/3 to Barnes and 2/3 to Lee, but the salary is taken from the profit before splitting.

So total profit: 28,269.

Salary: 300.

Remaining profit: 28,269 - 300 = 27,969.

Barnes's share: 1/3 *27,969 = 9,323.

Lee's share: 2/3 *27,969 = 18,646.

So Barnes's total: 300 + 9,323 = 9,623.

Lee: 18,646.

No option matches this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option D is Barnes: 9,423, Lee: 18,846.

Which would be the case if the salary is not subtracted, and the entire profit is split as 1/3 and 2/3, and then the salary is subtracted from Barnes's share.

Wait, that would be:

Barnes's share: (1/3)*28,269 = 9,423.

Then subtract salary: 9,423 - 300 = 9,123. But that's not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the salary is part of the profit, so the total profit is 28,269, and Barnes gets 1/3, Lee 2/3, and then Barnes also gets the salary from his share.

Wait, that would be:

Barnes's share: (1/3)*28,269 = 9,423.

Plus salary: 9,423 + 300 = 9,723.

Lee's share: 18,846.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the salary is a fixed amount per week, and the profit is for a certain number of weeks. But the problem doesn't specify the number of weeks, so perhaps it's for one week.

If the profit is for one week, then total profit is $28,269 for the week. Barnes's salary is $300 for the week, so the remaining profit is 28,269 - 300 = 27,969.

Then, Barnes gets 1/3 of 27,969, which is 9,323, plus his salary of 300, totaling 9,623.

Lee gets 2/3 of 27,969, which is 18,646.

But again, no option matches. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me try another approach. Maybe the salary is not subtracted but is part of the profit sharing.

So total profit is 28,269.

Barnes's total = (1/3)*28,269 + 300 = 9,423 + 300 = 9,723.

Lee's total = (2/3)*28,269 = 18,846.

But option D is Barnes:9,423, Lee:18,846, which is without the salary added.

So perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not sure why the salary isn't included.

Alternatively, perhaps the salary is not part of the profit, so the total profit is 28,269, which is distributed as follows: Barnes gets 1/3, Lee 2/3. Then, Barnes also gets his salary of $300 from somewhere else.

But that would make Barnes's total 9,423 + 300 = 9,723, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the salary is taken after the profit split. So the total profit is split first, then the salary is subtracted from Barnes's share.

But that doesn't make sense because the salary is a fixed amount.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me look at the options again.

Option D: Barnes:9,423, Lee:18,846.

Which is exactly 1/3 and 2/3 of 28,269.

So perhaps the problem is that the salary is not subtracted, and Barnes's total is just 1/3 of the profit, which is 9,423, and Lee gets 18,846.

But that would mean Barnes doesn't get his salary from the profit, which contradicts the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant that Barnes's salary is $300 per week, and the profit is for a certain number of weeks. But without knowing the number of weeks, I can't calculate that.

Wait, perhaps the problem treats the salary as a fixed amount, and the remaining profit is split as 1/3 and 2/3, but the profit is $28,269 after salary.

Wait, that would mean:

Total profit after salary: 28,269.

So salary is subtracted first: 28,269 = P - 300.

So P = 28,269 + 300 = 28,569.

Then, from P, Barnes gets 1/3, Lee 2/3.

So Barnes's share: 28,569 * 1/3 = 9,523.

Lee's share: 28,569 * 2/3 = 19,046.

But that doesn't match any option either.

I'm really confused now. Maybe I should look for an option where Barnes gets 1/3 of (28,269 - 300).

So 28,269 - 300 =27,969.

1/3 of that is 9,323.

So Barnes's total would be 9,323, and Lee's would be 18,646.

Looking at the options, none match. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me try to think differently.

Maybe the problem is that the salary is a fixed amount, and the remaining profit is split as follows: Barnes gets 1/3, Lee 2/3.

So:

Total profit: 28,269.

Salary: 300.

Remaining profit: 28,269 - 300 =27,969.

Barnes's share: 1/3 *27,969 =9,323.

Lee's share:2/3 *27,969=18,646.

So Barnes's total:300 +9,323=9,623.

Lee:18,646.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, looking at option D: Barnes:9,423, Lee:18,846.

If I calculate 1/3 of 28,269, I get 9,423, which is what Barnes would get if he took 1/3 of the total profit, but that doesn't include the salary.

So perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm not sure why the salary isn't included. Maybe the problem intended for the salary to be part of the profit sharing, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the correct answer isn't listed. But since I have to choose from the options, I'll go with the one that aligns with the calculation where Barnes gets 1/3 of the remaining profit after salary, which is 9,323, plus 300, totaling 9,623, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is D, where Barnes gets 9,423 and Lee 18,846, assuming the salary isn't subtracted.

Wait, but that would mean the salary isn't part of the calculation, which contradicts the problem statement. I'm really stuck here.

Wait, let me try to see which option adds up to 28,269.

Option D: 9,423 +18,846=28,269. Yes, that's correct.

So if the total is correct, and the profit is split as 1/3 and 2/3, then the answer would be D, but that ignores the salary. So perhaps the problem intended for the salary to be part of the profit, and Barnes gets 1/3, Lee 2/3.

But the problem says Barnes receives a weekly salary of $300, which suggests it's a separate payment. So I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the salary is considered as part of the profit, so the total profit is 28,269, which includes the salary. So Barnes's total is 1/3, which is 9,423, and Lee gets 2/3, which is 18,846.

So the answer would be D.

But I'm not entirely sure because the problem mentions the salary as a separate payment. However, since the total in option D adds up to the profit, perhaps that's the intended answer.
</think>

The problem involves distributing $28,269 in profits between Frank Lee and Steve Barnes. Barnes receives a weekly salary of $300 and 1/3 of the remaining net income, while Lee receives the other 2/3. 

1. **Total Profit**: $28,269  
2. **Barnes's Salary**: $300  
3. **Remaining Profit**: $28,269 - $300 = $27,969  
4. **Barnes's Share of Remaining Profit**: 1/3 of $27,969 = $9,323  
5. **Lee's Share of Remaining Profit**: 2/3 of $27,969 = $18,646  
6. **Barnes's Total**: $300 (salary) + $9,323 = $9,623  
7. **Lee's Total**: $18,646  

However, none of the options match these calculated amounts. Reassessing, if the salary is not subtracted and the profit is split directly as 1/3 and 2/3:  
- Barnes: 1/3 of $28,269 = $9,423  
- Lee: 2/3 of $28,269 = $18,846  

This matches **Option D**, where the total profit is correctly distributed without accounting for the salary as a separate deduction. While this approach contradicts the problem's wording, it aligns with the given options.

**Answer: D**
