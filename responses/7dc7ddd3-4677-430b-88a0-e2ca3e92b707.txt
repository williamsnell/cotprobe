Okay, so I have this problem about a cylindrical container with oil and a transformer immersed in it. The goal is to find the surface temperature of the container when the energy loss is 2.0 kW. The container's bottom is insulated, so heat is lost only by natural convection to the ambient air at 80°F.

Hmm, first, I remember that natural convection involves the heat transfer due to the movement of fluid (oil in this case) around the container. The formula for natural convection is Q = h * A * (T_s - T_ambient), where Q is the heat loss, h is the convective heat transfer coefficient, A is the surface area, T_s is the surface temperature of the container, and T_ambient is the surrounding temperature.

Wait, the transformer is immersed in oil, so the oil is probably heating up. The container's surface would then be at a higher temperature than the ambient air. So, the heat loss from the container to the air is due to the temperature difference between the oil's surface and the ambient.

But the problem says the container's bottom is insulated, so heat loss is only from the sides and top, maybe? Or is it considering the entire surface except the bottom? The container is cylindrical, so the surface area would be the lateral surface area plus the top, but wait, no, if it's a closed container, maybe just the lateral surface. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify if it's open or closed. Maybe I should assume it's a vertical cylinder with only the sides exposed for convection. Alternatively, perhaps it's a vertical cylinder with the top open, so the oil is exposed, but the problem mentions the container's surface, so maybe the area is just the lateral surface.

Wait, the container is 3 ft in diameter and 5 ft high. So, diameter D=3 ft, height h=5 ft. The surface area for a cylinder is πDh for the lateral surface. So A = π * 3 * 5 = 15π sq ft, approximately 47.12 sq ft.

The heat loss Q is 2.0 kW. I need to convert that to BTU per hour because typically, in such problems, the heat transfer coefficient is in BTU/(hr·ft²·°F). Wait, 1 kW is approximately 3412.14 BTU/h, so 2.0 kW is about 6824.28 BTU/h.

The ambient temperature is 80°F. We need to find T_s.

So, Q = h * A * (T_s - 80). We need to find h. But for that, we have to use the natural convection formula, which involves the Grashof number (Gr), Prandtl number (Pr), and the geometry factor.

Wait, the problem gives a table for different geometries. The container is a vertical cylinder (since it's a container standing upright), so I should look under "Vertical planes and cylinders" in the table.

The table says for 10^4 < N(Gr)LNPr < 10^9, the factor is N, and for 10^9 < N(Gr)LNPr < 10^12, the factor is 0.29. Wait, but what's N? Oh, I think N is the geometry factor, which for vertical cylinders might depend on the length to diameter ratio or something like that.

Wait, the container is vertical, so the geometry factor for vertical planes and cylinders is based on height. The table says for vertical planes and cylinders, the factor is 1/4 height or 1/3 height? Let me check the table again.

Looking at the table, under "Vertical planes and cylinders", the geometry factors are:

- 10^4 < N(Gr)LNPr < 10^9: N, 1/4 height
- 10^9 < N(Gr)LNPr < 10^12: 0.29, 1/3 height

Wait, perhaps I'm misreading it. Let me parse the table correctly. The table's columns are probably the ranges and the corresponding N and C values.

Wait, the table might be structured as:

Geometry | Range of application | C | n | L
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Vertical planes and cylinders | 10^4 < N(Gr)LNPr < 10^9 | N | 1/4 | height
| 10^9 < N(Gr)LNPr < 10^12 | 0.29 | 1/3 | height

Wait, perhaps the 'n' column is the exponent, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps for vertical cylinders, the geometry factor is either 1/4 height or 1/3 height, depending on the Gr and Pr values.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the Grashof number and Prandtl number for the oil. Wait, but what's the oil? The problem doesn't specify the type of oil, so maybe I can assume it's transformer oil. Transformer oil is typically mineral oil, which has certain properties.

I think the properties of transformer oil are roughly: thermal conductivity k around 0.13 W/m·K, specific heat capacity c_p around 1800 J/kg·K, dynamic viscosity μ around 0.0001 Pa·s (or 0.0001 N·s/m²), and thermal expansion coefficient β around 0.0007 1/°C.

Wait, but these are in SI units, and the problem is in imperial units. I'll need to convert them.

Let me convert these properties to imperial units:

- Thermal conductivity k: 0.13 W/m·K = 0.13 * 3.172 W/(ft·°F) ≈ 0.0412 ft·°F/(hr·Btu) [Wait, maybe better to look up the conversion properly. Alternatively, perhaps I can find standard properties for transformer oil in imperial units.]

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the Prandtl number for transformer oil. The Prandtl number Pr = c_p * μ / k.

Let me compute this using SI units first and then see if I can convert or find the value.

Transformer oil:

c_p ≈ 1800 J/(kg·K)
μ ≈ 0.0001 kg/(m·s)
k ≈ 0.13 W/(m·K) → 0.13 J/(s·m·K)

Pr = (1800 J/(kg·K)) * (0.0001 kg/(m·s)) / (0.13 J/(s·m·K)) 
= (1800 * 0.0001) / 0.13 
= 0.18 / 0.13 ≈ 1.38.

So Pr ≈ 1.38.

Now, the Grashof number Gr = (β * g * ΔT * L^3) / ν², where ΔT is the temperature difference between the surface and the ambient, L is the characteristic length (for a cylinder, it's the height, I think), and ν is the kinematic viscosity.

Wait, but since we don't know ΔT (which is T_s - 80°F), we can't compute Gr directly. Alternatively, perhaps we can make an assumption based on typical conditions or find a way around it.

Wait, perhaps for natural convection, when the surface is at a higher temperature than the ambient, the Grashof number depends on the temperature difference. But without knowing T_s, it's a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that the temperature difference is small compared to the absolute temperatures, but that might not hold here.

Wait, maybe I can find the average temperature. Let's say T_s is around 275°F (since the options are all above 250°F), and ambient is 80°F. So ΔT is about 195°F. But that's a rough estimate.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed step by step. Let me outline the steps:

1. Determine the convective heat transfer coefficient h using natural convection equations, which depends on Gr and Pr.
2. Use the formula Q = h * A * (T_s - T_ambient) to solve for T_s.

But to find h, I need to use the formula h = (k * C * L^n) / (something), but perhaps it's better to use the empirical relation involving Gr, Pr, and the geometry factor.

The general formula for h in natural convection is:

h = (k / ν) * (Gr * Pr)^(1/3) * C,

where C is the geometry factor from the table.

Wait, but for vertical cylinders, the geometry factor depends on whether the cylinder is tall or short. Let's consider the Grashof number and Prandtl number to determine which row in the table to use.

But without knowing Gr, I can't directly use the table. Hmm, perhaps I can make an assumption based on typical values. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use a standard formula or assume a certain value.

Wait, another approach: the formula for the convective coefficient for natural convection from a vertical cylinder is given by:

h = (k * Gr^(1/3) * Pr^(1/3)) * C,

where C is a constant based on the geometry. For a vertical cylinder, the C factor for high Gr is 0.29, as per the table. Wait, looking back, the table for vertical cylinders under 10^9 < Gr*LNPr < 10^12 uses 0.29 and the length is height, with the factor being 1/3 height.

Wait, perhaps the height is the characteristic length L. So L = h = 5 ft.

So, the formula would be:

h = (k / ν) * (Gr * Pr)^(1/3) * C,

where C is 0.29.

But again, without knowing Gr, I'm stuck. Alternatively, perhaps I can express Gr in terms of h and other variables.

Wait, maybe I can express Gr in terms of the known quantities. Let's try.

Gr = (β * g * ΔT * L^3) / ν^2.

But ΔT is T_s - 80°F. Let me denote ΔT as T.

So Gr = (β * g * T * L^3) / ν^2.

But I don't know T yet. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make an assumption about the temperature difference and proceed iteratively, but that might be time-consuming.

Wait, perhaps I can find a way to express h in terms of Q, A, T, and then relate it to Gr and Pr.

So from Q = h * A * (T - T_ambient), we can write h = Q / (A (T - T_ambient)).

But h is also a function of Gr, Pr, and the geometry. So substituting h into the equation:

(Q) = [ (k / ν) * (Gr * Pr)^(1/3) * C ] * A * (T - T_ambient).

But Gr is a function of T, so this becomes a nonlinear equation in T, which might be challenging to solve without iteration.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find an average or approximate value for Gr and proceed.

Let me try to compute Gr using an assumed T.

Assume T_s is 275°F. Then ΔT = 275 - 80 = 195°F.

But in SI units, that's 195 + 273.15 = 468.15 K. Wait, no, because Gr uses ΔT in absolute terms, but perhaps in the formula, it's the difference in temperature, so maybe it's better to use ΔT in °C or K.

Wait, but the properties are in imperial units, so perhaps I should keep everything in °F.

Wait, actually, the formula for Gr uses the thermal expansion coefficient β, which is typically given in 1/°F or 1/°C. Let me check the value of β for transformer oil.

Transformer oil has β approximately 0.0007 1/°F.

So β ≈ 0.0007 per °F.

g is the acceleration due to gravity, which is 32.174 ft/s².

ν is the kinematic viscosity, which for transformer oil is μ/ρ. The density ρ of transformer oil is around 54.7 lbm/ft³. So ν = μ / ρ.

Earlier, I had μ ≈ 0.0001 Pa·s. Let me convert that to lbm/(hr·ft). Wait, 1 Pa·s = 1 N·s/m². Converting to lbm/(hr·ft):

1 N = 0.224808943 lb_f. 1 m² = 10.76391 ft². So 1 Pa·s = (0.224808943 lb_f·s) / (10.76391 ft²) ≈ 0.0208888 lb_f·s/ft².

But lb_f·s/ft² can be converted to lbm/(hr·ft) using the relation 1 slug = 32.174 lbm·ft/lbf·s². But this might be getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the kinematic viscosity for transformer oil in imperial units.

Looking up, transformer oil has a kinematic viscosity ν around 0.000145 ft²/s at around 60°C (which is 140°F). Since our assumed T_s is 275°F, which is much higher, so the viscosity would be lower, but perhaps using 0.000145 ft²/s as a rough estimate.

Wait, but that's at 140°F. At higher temperatures, the viscosity decreases. So at 275°F, ν would be lower than 0.000145 ft²/s. Let's say approximately 0.0001 ft²/s for an estimate.

Now, Gr = (β * g * ΔT * L^3) / ν^2.

Plugging in the numbers:

β = 0.0007 1/°F
g = 32.174 ft/s²
ΔT = 195°F
L = 5 ft
ν = 0.0001 ft²/s

Gr = (0.0007 * 32.174 * 195 * 5^3) / (0.0001)^2.

Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 0.0007 * 32.174 ≈ 0.0225218
Then, 0.0225218 * 195 ≈ 4.389357
Then, 4.389357 * 5^3 = 4.389357 * 125 ≈ 548.6696.

Denominator: (0.0001)^2 = 0.00000001.

So Gr ≈ 548.6696 / 0.00000001 ≈ 5.486696 × 10^9.

Wait, that's 5.486 × 10^9. Looking back at the table, for vertical cylinders, the range 10^9 < Gr*LNPr < 10^12 uses C=0.29 and the geometry factor is 1/3 height.

Wait, but wait, the table says for vertical cylinders, when 10^9 < N(Gr)LNPr < 10^12, C is 0.29 and the length is 1/3 height. So the geometry factor is 1/3 of the height.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about what N(Gr)LNPr means. Oh, perhaps N is the Grashof number multiplied by the Prandtl number multiplied by some function of length? Or maybe it's a typo in the table, and it's Gr * Pr.

Wait, perhaps N(Gr)LNPr is Gr * Pr * L * something. Hmm, maybe it's a typo, and it's just Gr * Pr.

In any case, our computed Gr is approximately 5.49 × 10^9, which falls into the second range for vertical cylinders: 10^9 < Gr*Pr < 10^12. So we use C=0.29 and the geometry factor is 1/3 of the height.

Wait, but what's the actual formula for h? The general formula using Gr and Pr for natural convection is:

h = (k / ν) * (Gr * Pr)^(1/3) * C,

where C is the geometry factor.

So, let's compute this.

We have:

k = thermal conductivity of oil, which I think is around 0.13 W/(m·K), but in imperial units, this is 0.13 * (3.172) ≈ 0.412 Btu/(hr·ft·°F). Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let's convert k to imperial units properly.

1 W/(m·K) = 0.5779 Btu/(hr·ft·°F). So 0.13 W/(m·K) ≈ 0.13 * 0.5779 ≈ 0.0751 Btu/(hr·ft·°F).

ν = 0.0001 ft²/s.

So,

h = (0.0751 Btu/(hr·ft·°F)) / (0.0001 ft²/s) * (5.49e9 * 1.38)^(1/3) * 0.29.

Wait, let's compute each part step by step.

First, compute Gr * Pr:

Gr = 5.49e9
Pr = 1.38
Gr * Pr ≈ 5.49e9 * 1.38 ≈ 7.57e9.

Now, (Gr * Pr)^(1/3) ≈ (7.57e9)^(1/3). Cube of 2000 is 8e9, so cube root of 7.57e9 is about 1960.

Wait, 1960^3 = (2000 - 40)^3 ≈ 2000^3 - 3*2000^2*40 + ... ≈ 8e9 - 4.8e9 = 3.2e9. Hmm, that's not matching. Wait, perhaps better to compute it accurately.

Let me compute 7.57e9^(1/3):

We know that 2000^3 = 8e9, so 7.57e9 is about 0.946 * 8e9, so cube root is approximately 2000 * (0.946)^(1/3). The cube root of 0.946 is about 0.982, so approximately 2000 * 0.982 ≈ 1964.

So, (Gr * Pr)^(1/3) ≈ 1964.

Now, h = (0.0751 / 0.0001) * 1964 * 0.29.

Compute 0.0751 / 0.0001 = 751.

Then, 751 * 1964 ≈ let's compute 750 * 2000 = 1,500,000, but subtract 750*(36) = 27,000, so approx 1,500,000 - 27,000 = 1,473,000. Then, multiply by 0.29:

1,473,000 * 0.29 ≈ 1,473,000 * 0.3 = 441,900 minus 1,473,000 * 0.01 = 14,730, so approx 441,900 - 14,730 ≈ 427,170 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Wait, that seems extremely high. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the units. Let me recheck the units:

k is in Btu/(hr·ft·°F), ν is in ft²/s.

So, (k/ν) has units (Btu/(hr·ft·°F)) / (ft²/s) = (Btu/(hr·ft·°F)) * (s / ft²) = (Btu·s)/(hr·ft³·°F).

But h is in Btu/(hr·ft²·°F), so perhaps I messed up the units somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula h = (k / ν) * (Gr * Pr)^(1/3) * C, where:

k is in Btu/(hr·ft·°F),
ν in ft²/s,
Gr is dimensionless,
Pr is dimensionless,
C is dimensionless.

So, the units would be (Btu/(hr·ft·°F)) / (ft²/s) ) * (unitless) * (unitless) → (Btu/(hr·ft·°F)) * s / ft² → (Btu·s)/(hr·ft³·°F).

But h should be Btu/(hr·ft²·°F), so perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula uses the thermal conductivity and other properties differently. Let me check.

Wait, another approach: use the formula h = (k * C * L^n) * (Gr * Pr)^(1/3).

Wait, perhaps I can find an alternative expression. Let me look up the formula for natural convection from a vertical cylinder.

Upon checking, the formula for h is:

h = (k * (Gr * Pr)^(1/3) * C) / (L^n),

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

h = (k / ν) * (Gr * Pr)^(1/3) * C,

where C is the geometry factor.

But in any case, given that I'm getting a very high h, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute (k/ν) again.

k ≈ 0.0751 Btu/(hr·ft·°F)
ν ≈ 0.0001 ft²/s

So, k/ν = 0.0751 / 0.0001 = 751 Btu/(hr·ft·°F·ft²/s) → which is Btu/(hr·ft³·°F·s).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to check the units again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula in terms of the Reynolds number or other dimensionless numbers, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps I can approach this differently. Since the problem gives a table, maybe I can use the table to find the appropriate C factor and n value, then compute h.

From the table, for vertical cylinders when Gr*Pr is between 1e9 and 1e12, C is 0.29, and the length is 1/3 of the height.

So, the formula would be h = (k * C * (Gr * Pr)^(1/3)) / (L^n),

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exponents. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

h = k * (Gr * Pr)^(1/3) * C / (L^n),

where n is given in the table. Looking at the table, for vertical cylinders in the 1e9 < Gr*Pr < 1e12 range, the n is 1/3, and L is the height.

So, h = k * (Gr * Pr)^(1/3) * C / (h^(1/3)).

Wait, that would make h = k * (Gr * Pr)^(1/3) * 0.29 / (5^(1/3)).

But I'm not confident about this approach. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

h = (k * (Gr * Pr)^(1/3) * C) / (L^n),

where n is 1/3.

So, h = (0.0751 Btu/(hr·ft·°F)) * (5.49e9 * 1.38)^(1/3) * 0.29 / (5^(1/3)).

Compute each part:

(5.49e9 * 1.38) = 7.57e9.

(7.57e9)^(1/3) ≈ 1964.

5^(1/3) ≈ 1.710.

So,

h ≈ 0.0751 * 1964 * 0.29 / 1.710.

Compute 0.0751 * 1964 ≈ 147.33.

147.33 * 0.29 ≈ 42.7257.

42.7257 / 1.710 ≈ 25.0.

So, h ≈ 25 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Now, using the formula Q = h * A * (T_s - T_ambient),

We have Q = 2.0 kW = 6824.28 Btu/hr,

A = π * D * h = π * 3 * 5 = 15π ≈ 47.12 sq ft.

So,

6824.28 = 25 * 47.12 * (T_s - 80).

Compute 25 * 47.12 = 1178.

So,

6824.28 = 1178 * (T_s - 80).

Divide both sides by 1178:

(T_s - 80) ≈ 6824.28 / 1178 ≈ 5.797.

So, T_s ≈ 80 + 5.797 ≈ 85.797°F.

Wait, that's way too low compared to the options given (all above 250°F). So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating h. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe my assumption about ν was wrong. Earlier, I took ν as 0.0001 ft²/s, but at higher temperatures, the viscosity would be lower, so ν would be smaller, which would make Gr larger.

Wait, earlier I assumed ν = 0.0001 ft²/s at 140°F, but at 275°F, ν would be lower. Let's say ν is 0.00005 ft²/s. Then Gr would be higher, which would increase h.

Wait, let's recalculate Gr with ν = 0.00005 ft²/s.

Gr = (β * g * ΔT * L^3) / ν^2.

β = 0.0007 1/°F,

g = 32.174 ft/s²,

ΔT = 195°F,

L = 5 ft,

ν = 0.00005 ft²/s.

So,

Numerator: 0.0007 * 32.174 ≈ 0.0225218,

0.0225218 * 195 ≈ 4.389357,

4.389357 * 5^3 = 4.389357 * 125 ≈ 548.6696,

Denominator: (0.00005)^2 = 0.0000000025.

So Gr ≈ 548.6696 / 0.0000000025 = 548.6696 / 2.5e-8 ≈ 2.1946784e11 ≈ 2.1947 × 10^11.

That's within the range 1e10 to 1e12, so the C factor is 0.29 and n=1/3.

Now, h = (k * (Gr * Pr)^(1/3) * C) / (L^n).

k = 0.0751 Btu/(hr·ft·°F),

Gr * Pr = 2.1947e11 * 1.38 ≈ 3.007e11.

(3.007e11)^(1/3) ≈ let's compute cube of 6.67 is 296, so 6.67e3^3 = (6.67^3)*1e9 ≈ 296 * 1e9 = 2.96e11. So, cube root is approx 6.67e3.

So, (Gr * Pr)^(1/3) ≈ 6670.

C = 0.29,

L = 5 ft,

n = 1/3,

L^n = 5^(1/3) ≈ 1.710.

So,

h = (0.0751 * 6670 * 0.29) / 1.710.

Compute numerator: 0.0751 * 6670 ≈ 499.197,

499.197 * 0.29 ≈ 144.767.

144.767 / 1.710 ≈ 84.65.

So h ≈ 84.65 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Now, using Q = h * A * (T_s - 80),

6824.28 Btu/hr = 84.65 * 47.12 * (T_s - 80).

Compute 84.65 * 47.12 ≈ let's compute 80*47.12=3769.6, 4.65*47.12≈219. So total ≈ 3769.6 + 219 ≈ 3988.6.

So,

6824.28 = 3988.6 * (T_s -80),

(T_s -80) ≈ 6824.28 / 3988.6 ≈ 1.71.

So T_s ≈ 80 + 1.71 ≈ 81.71°F. That's even lower, which doesn't make sense. I must have messed up the formula.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me look for an alternative approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for heat transfer coefficient for vertical cylinders in free convection, which is:

h = (0.29 * k * (Gr * Pr)^(1/3)) / (L^(1/3)).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I should refer to the Nusselt number, Nu = h * L / k = (Gr * Pr)^(1/3) * C,

where C is the geometry factor.

So, Nu = (Gr * Pr)^(1/3) * C.

Then, h = (Nu * k) / L.

So,

h = [ (Gr * Pr)^(1/3) * C * k ] / L.

Let me compute this.

Gr = 2.1947e11,

Pr=1.38,

(Gr * Pr) = 2.1947e11 * 1.38 ≈ 3.007e11,

(Gr*Pr)^(1/3) ≈ 6670,

C=0.29,

k=0.0751,

L=5.

So,

h = (6670 * 0.29 * 0.0751) / 5.

Compute numerator: 6670 * 0.29 ≈ 1934.3,

1934.3 * 0.0751 ≈ 145.27.

Divide by 5: 145.27 /5 ≈ 29.05 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Now, Q = h * A * (T_s - 80),

6824.28 = 29.05 * 47.12 * (T_s -80).

Compute 29.05 * 47.12 ≈ let's compute 29 *47=1363, 0.05*47=2.35 → total ≈1365.35.

So,

6824.28 = 1365.35 * (T_s -80),

(T_s -80) ≈ 6824.28 / 1365.35 ≈4.996.

So, T_s ≈80 +4.996≈84.996°F. Again, way too low.

Wait, this can't be right because the options are all above 250°F. I must have made a mistake in using the properties or the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the surface temperature in a different way. Maybe I should consider that the transformer itself is generating heat, but the problem states that the loss of energy is 2.0 kW, which is the heat loss from the container to the ambient.

Wait, perhaps the oil's thermal conductivity is much lower than I thought, or maybe I'm using the wrong properties. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula with the correct units.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an alternative approach. Let me try to find the formula for the surface temperature of a vertical cylinder with natural convection.

After some research, I find that the formula for the surface temperature Ts can be found using:

Q = (k * A * (Ts - Tambient)) / (x),

where x is the thickness, but that's for conduction, not convection.

Wait, no, that's not applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula:

h = (k / x) * (Gr * Pr)^(1/3) * C,

but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula with the given table directly without getting into the detailed properties. Let's try that.

From the table, for vertical cylinders where 10^9 < Gr*Pr <10^12, the factor is 0.29, and the length is 1/3 of the height.

So, the formula for heat transfer coefficient h would be:

h = k * (Gr * Pr)^(1/3) * 0.29 / (L^(1/3)).

But without knowing Gr and Pr, I can't compute h directly. So perhaps the problem expects me to use an average value for h.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the transformer's heat loss is transferred to the oil, which then transfers it to the container, and then the container loses heat via natural convection. But the problem states that the loss is 2.0 kW, which is the heat lost from the container.

Wait, perhaps I should ignore the oil and consider the container directly. But the transformer is immersed in oil, so the oil would be at the container's temperature, and the container's surface would be at Ts.

Alternatively, perhaps the oil's properties are not needed because the container's surface is at Ts, and the oil is just the medium between the container and the transformer, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to find a standard formula for the surface temperature of a vertical cylinder losing heat via natural convection.

Upon checking, I find that the surface temperature can be found using:

Ts = Tambient + (Q / (h * A)),

where h is the convective heat transfer coefficient.

But to find h, I need to use the properties of the fluid and the geometry.

Wait, perhaps I can find h using the formula:

h = (k * (Gr * Pr)^(1/3) * C) / L^(1/3),

where C is 0.29, L is the height, and Gr and Pr are calculated using the oil's properties.

But without knowing Ts, I can't compute Gr, which depends on Ts.

This seems like a circular problem. Maybe I can make an initial guess for Ts, compute Gr, then h, then Ts again, iterating until it converges.

Let me try that.

Assume an initial Ts of 300°F.

ΔT = 300 -80 = 220°F.

Compute Gr:

Gr = (β * g * ΔT * L^3) / ν^2.

We need ν and β at Ts=300°F.

Transformer oil at 300°F: looking up properties, β ≈ 0.0007/°F, ν ≈ 0.00005 ft²/s.

So,

Gr = (0.0007 * 32.174 * 220 * 5^3) / (0.00005)^2.

Compute numerator:

0.0007 *32.174 ≈ 0.0225218,

0.0225218 *220 ≈4.9548,

4.9548 * 125 (since 5^3=125) ≈619.35.

Denominator: (0.00005)^2 = 2.5e-9.

Gr ≈619.35 / 2.5e-9 ≈2.4774e11.

Gr*Pr = 2.4774e11 *1.38 ≈3.416e11.

(Gr*Pr)^(1/3) ≈ cube root of 3.416e11.

Since 7e3^3=3.43e11, so cube root is approx 7e3.

h = (k * (Gr*Pr)^(1/3) * C) / L^(1/3).

k=0.0751 Btu/(hr·ft·°F),

C=0.29,

L=5 ft,

L^(1/3)=1.710.

So,

h = (0.0751 *7e3 *0.29 ) /1.710.

Compute numerator:

0.0751 *7e3 =525.7,

525.7 *0.29≈152.45.

152.45 /1.710≈89.15 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Now, compute Ts using Q=2.0kW=6824.28 Btu/hr,

A=47.12 sq ft,

So,

6824.28 =89.15 *47.12*(Ts-80).

Compute 89.15*47.12≈4206.

So,

6824.28=4206*(Ts-80),

(Ts-80)=6824.28/4206≈1.623.

Ts≈80+1.623≈81.623°F. That's way too low. Hmm, something's wrong.

Wait, maybe my assumption about Ts as 300°F is too high, leading to lower h and thus lower Ts. But the options are all higher than 250°F, so I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the transformer's heat is conducted through the oil to the container's surface, which then loses heat via convection. But the problem states that the loss is 2.0kW from the container, so maybe the oil's properties are not needed, and I can proceed directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the surface temperature without considering the oil, treating the container as a solid cylinder losing heat via natural convection. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula with the given table and assume that the geometry factor is 1/3 of the height, and use the given C=0.29.

Let me try to compute h without knowing Gr and Pr.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem provides the table to use with N(Gr)LNPr, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Let me think about the options. The options are all above 250°F, so perhaps the surface temperature is much higher than the ambient 80°F. Let me try to compute h using a higher Ts.

Assume Ts=300°F, ΔT=220°F.

Gr= (0.0007 *32.174 *220 *125)/(0.00005^2)= same as before, 2.477e11.

h= (0.0751 * (2.477e11 *1.38)^(1/3) *0.29)/(5^(1/3)).

Compute (2.477e11 *1.38)=3.416e11.

Cube root≈7e3.

So,

h=(0.0751 *7e3 *0.29)/1.710≈(0.0751 *2030)/1.710≈152.45/1.710≈89.15 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Then,

6824.28=89.15 *47.12*(Ts-80).

Compute 89.15*47.12≈4206.

So,

Ts-80=6824.28/4206≈1.623.

Ts≈81.62°F. Still too low.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Maybe the formula for h is different. Let me try using the formula h = (k * (Gr * Pr)^(1/3) * C) / (L^(1/3)).

So,

h= (0.0751 * (2.477e11 *1.38)^(1/3) *0.29)/(5^(1/3)).

Which is same as before, h≈89.15 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

But that gives Ts≈81.62°F, which doesn't match the options.

I must be making a mistake somewhere. Perhaps I should consider that the transformer's heat is conducted to the oil, which then conducts to the container. But the problem states the loss is 2.0kW from the container, so maybe that's the heat transfer from the container to the oil, which then transfers it to the air. But that complicates things further.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the oil and treat the container as a solid losing heat via natural convection. But without the oil's properties, I can't compute h.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula with the given table and assume that the Gr*Pr falls into a certain range, selecting C=0.29 and n=1/3.

Then, using the formula:

h = k * (Gr * Pr)^(1/3) * C / (L^n).

But without knowing Gr*Pr, I can't compute h. So perhaps the problem expects me to use an approximate value for h based on the table.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to select the answer based on the given options and typical temperature ranges.

Wait, given that the options are all above 250°F, and my calculation gave around 80°F, which is way off, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the transformer is generating heat, which is conducted to the oil and then to the container, and the container loses heat via natural convection. But the problem states that the loss is 2.0kW, which is the heat lost from the container. So perhaps the heat transfer from the transformer to the oil and then to the container is not needed, and we can directly use the container's heat loss.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula for the surface temperature of a vertical cylinder with the given heat loss, using the table's C factor.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula:

Q = h * A * (Ts - Tambient),

where h is found using the table's C factor and properties.

But without knowing h, I can't proceed. Alternatively, perhaps I can assume a value for h and solve for Ts, but that's not efficient.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an example problem or formula that directly relates the given parameters to the surface temperature.

After some time, I realize I'm stuck and might need to make an educated guess based on the options and the fact that my initial calculations gave a much lower temperature, which suggests I might have used the wrong properties or approach.

Given the options, and considering that the heat loss is 2kW, which is significant, and the container is 5ft high, the surface temperature is likely to be quite high. Among the options, C:300°F and I:290°F are plausible.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 300°F.
</think>

To determine the surface temperature of the cylindrical container, we analyze the heat loss via natural convection. The container has a diameter of 3 ft and a height of 5 ft, with an oil-immersed transformer generating a heat loss of 2.0 kW. The bottom is insulated, and heat is lost to ambient air at 80°F.

### Key Steps:
1. **Heat Loss Formula**:  
   \( Q = h \cdot A \cdot (T_s - T_{\text{ambient}}) \),  
   where \( Q = 2.0 \, \text{kW} = 6824.28 \, \text{Btu/hr} \), \( A = \pi \cdot D \cdot h = 47.12 \, \text{ft}^2 \), and \( T_{\text{ambient}} = 80°F \).

2. **Convective Heat Transfer Coefficient (\( h \))**:  
   Using the table for vertical cylinders, the geometry factor \( C = 0.29 \) and \( n = 1/3 \) apply for \( 10^9 < \text{Gr} \cdot \text{Pr} < 10^{12} \). The formula for \( h \) is:  
   \[
   h = \frac{k \cdot (\text{Gr} \cdot \text{Pr})^{1/3} \cdot C}{L^{1/3}}
   \]  
   where \( k \) is the thermal conductivity of oil, \( \text{Gr} \) is the Grashof number, \( \text{Pr} \) is the Prandtl number, and \( L = 5 \, \text{ft} \).

3. **Properties of Oil**:  
   Assuming transformer oil, \( k \approx 0.0751 \, \text{Btu/(hr·ft·°F)} \), \( \beta \approx 0.0007 \, \text{1/°F} \), \( \mu \approx 0.00005 \, \text{ft}^2/\text{s} \), and \( \nu = \mu / \rho \approx 0.00005 \, \text{ft}^2/\text{s} \).

4. **Grashof Number (\( \text{Gr} \))**:  
   \[
   \text{Gr} = \frac{\beta \cdot g \cdot \Delta T \cdot L^3}{\nu^2}
   \]  
   Substituting \( \beta = 0.0007 \), \( g = 32.174 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \), \( \Delta T = T_s - 80 \), and \( \nu = 0.00005 \), \( \text{Gr} \) depends on \( T_s \).

5. **Iterative Calculation**:  
   Solving for \( T_s \) involves iterating because \( \text{Gr} \) depends on \( T_s \). Initial guesses for \( T_s \) (e.g., 300°F) yield \( \text{Gr} \approx 2.48 \times 10^{11} \), leading to \( h \approx 89.15 \, \text{Btu/(hr·ft}^2\text{·°F)} \). Substituting into \( Q = h \cdot A \cdot (T_s - 80) \) gives \( T_s \approx 81.62°F \), which is inconsistent with the options.

6. **Revisiting the Approach**:  
   Given the options are all above 250°F, the initial approach likely underestimates \( T_s \). Adjusting for higher \( T_s \) increases \( \text{Gr} \), raising \( h \), but the calculations remain inconsistent with the options. This suggests a possible error in the properties or approach.

### Conclusion:
Based on the given options and the significant heat loss, the most plausible surface temperature is **300°F**.
