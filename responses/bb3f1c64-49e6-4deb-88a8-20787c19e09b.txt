Okay, so I've got this question about the Bond Equivalent Yield (BEY) for a U.S. Treasury bill. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says it's a $1,000, 13-week T-bill bought for $960. I need to find the yield using the BEY method. Hmm, I remember that BEY is a way to calculate the annualized yield on a short-term security, like a T-bill, which is quoted as a discount rate.

Wait, so how does BEY work? I think it's calculated by taking the discount rate and then annualizing it. The formula I recall is something like:

BEY = ( (Face Value - Purchase Price) / Purchase Price ) * (365 / Days to Maturity)

So let's break that down. The face value is $1,000, and the purchase price is $960. The days to maturity here are 13 weeks. Since each week has 7 days, that's 13 * 7 = 91 days.

First, I need to find the amount of the discount. That's Face Value minus Purchase Price. So $1,000 - $960 = $40. That's the discount, which is the profit when the bill matures.

Next, I think the formula uses that discount divided by the purchase price, which is $960. So $40 / $960. Let me calculate that: 40 divided by 960 is 0.0416667, or 4.16667%. That's the simple interest rate over the 91 days.

But BEY annualizes this rate. Since there are 365 days in a year, I divide 365 by the number of days to maturity, which is 91. So 365 / 91 equals approximately 4.010989. Let me check that: 91 times 4 is 364, so 365/91 is about 4.010989.

Now, multiply that annualization factor by the simple interest rate: 4.16667% * 4.010989. Let me calculate that. 4 times 4.16667 is 16.66668%, and then a little more from the 0.010989. Let's see, 4.16667 * 0.010989 ≈ 0.045833%. Adding that to 16.66668 gives approximately 16.7125%.

Looking at the options, I see G is 16.7%, which is very close to what I got. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, another way I've heard BEY calculated is by taking the discount divided by the purchase price and then multiplying by (365 / days). So yeah, same as above. So $40 discount, $960 purchase, so 40/960 = 0.0416667. Multiply by 365/91, which is roughly 4.010989. So 0.0416667 * 4.010989 ≈ 0.167125, or 16.7125%.

So the closest option is G: 16.7%. Alternatively, sometimes it's rounded to one decimal place, so 16.7% would be the answer. Let me check the options again: yes, G is 16.7, which matches my calculation.

I think that's it. So the answer should be G.

The Bond Equivalent Yield (BEY) is calculated by taking the discount rate, which is the difference between the face value and purchase price, divided by the purchase price. This rate is then annualized by multiplying by 365 divided by the number of days to maturity. For this T-bill, the discount is $40, the purchase price is $960, and the days to maturity are 91. The calculation yields approximately 16.71%, making the closest answer G: 16.7%.

Answer: G
