Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about a psychological scenario, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about Mrs. Wang calling because her 14-year-old daughter witnessed the assault of her best friend three days ago. The daughter is really upset, not sleeping, not eating, crying a lot. The psychologist in the question has limited experience with adolescents and crisis intervention, but there's no one else more experienced available. The question is what the ethical psychologist should do.

The options are A through G, with each suggesting a different course of action. Let me go through each one.

Option A: See the daughter only until the crisis ends or until alternative services are found. That sounds reasonable because in a crisis, immediate help is needed, and if the psychologist can't handle it long-term, maybe they can help until someone else takes over. But I'm not sure if this is the best approach, especially if the psychologist isn't experienced.

Option B: Offer to train Mrs. Wang to provide crisis intervention. Hmm, that seems a bit odd. The daughter is a minor, and Mrs. Wang is her mother. Training the mother might help, but the daughter is already in crisis, so maybe the mother isn't equipped to handle it. Plus, the psychologist's role is to provide therapy, not to train the parent unless it's part of a structured plan.

Option C: Suggest waiting a few days. The daughter is in a severe state—she hasn't slept, isn't eating, crying. Waiting might not be the best idea because the situation could get worse. Crisis intervention is usually immediate, so waiting might not be ethical.

Option D: Agree to see her without informing about the lack of experience. That sounds unethical because the psychologist should be honest about their capabilities. If they don't have the experience, they should seek help or refer, not hide it from the client.

Option E: Inform Mrs. Wang they can't see her daughter due to lack of experience. That might be the safe choice, but the question says there's no one else more experienced, so maybe the psychologist has to take on the case despite the lack of experience, but perhaps with a plan to get help.

Option F: Suggest trying to forget the incident. That's not helpful at all. Trauma needs to be addressed, not ignored. So F is probably not the right choice.

Option G: Recommend group therapy. While group therapy can be helpful, the daughter might need more individualized attention, especially in the acute phase of a crisis. Also, the psychologist's limited experience might make leading a group challenging.

Option H: Agree to see her since they've had some crisis intervention experience. Maybe "some" is enough, but the initial statement says limited experience. So it's a bit of a gray area. If they have some experience, maybe it's better to proceed but with a plan to get more help if needed.

Now, considering ethical obligations, psychologists are expected to provide competent care. If they don't have the necessary skills, they should seek supervision or refer. But if no one else is available, they might have to proceed while taking steps to get help.

Option A suggests providing services until the crisis ends or until alternative services are found. That seems like a responsible approach because it's immediate and ensures the daughter gets help without delay, while also making plans to transfer care if possible.

Option H says agree to see her because of some experience with crisis intervention. But if the experience is limited, especially with adolescents, is that sufficient? Maybe not. So perhaps A is better because it's about managing the crisis until more help is available.

Alternatively, E says they can't see her, but if no one else is available, refusing might leave the daughter without help, which is unethical. So perhaps the best approach is to provide immediate help while seeking alternatives, which aligns with Option A.

Wait, but Option H says they agree to see her because they've had some experience. If they have some experience, even limited, maybe they can proceed but with the caveat that they might seek consultation or supervision. But the question says they have limited experience, so perhaps it's better to limit the scope to crisis management and refer when possible.

So between A and H. A is about seeing her only until the crisis ends or until alternative services are located. H is about agreeing to see her based on some experience.

I think A is the better option because it's about providing temporary help while seeking more appropriate services, which is ethical. It's about not abandoning the client but ensuring they get the help they need, even if it's not the psychologist's area of expertise long-term.

The correct answer is **A**. The psychologist should provide immediate crisis intervention to Mrs. Wang’s daughter while actively seeking alternative services or support to ensure she receives appropriate care. This approach balances ethical obligations to help the child without overstepping their limited experience.
