Question:

How is the federal payroll tax that supports the Social Security program a regressive tax?

Options:

A: The tax is regressive because only self-employed individuals are required to pay it.
B: The tax is regressive because all workers pay the same percentage of their income.
C: The tax is regressive because higher incomes are taxed at a higher rate.
D: The tax is regressive because it only applies to the first $10,000 of income.
E: The tax is regressive because it exempts all investment income.
F: The tax is regressive because it includes additional deductions for higher income earners.
G: The tax is regressive because there is a dollar limit on the amount of income, subject to the tax.
H: The tax is regressive because lower incomes are not taxed to provide relief to lower earners.
I: The tax is regressive because it is only applied to non-wage forms of income.
J: The tax is regressive because it is a flat tax that takes a smaller proportion of income as the income rises.

Okay, so I need to figure out how the federal payroll tax that supports Social Security is regressive. I remember that regressive taxes are those where the tax rate decreases as the amount subject to taxation increases. So, higher income individuals pay a smaller percentage of their income in taxes compared to lower income individuals.

The payroll tax in question is the one that funds Social Security. I think this tax is only applied to earned income, specifically wages and salaries, and not on things like investment income. Wait, but the question is about it being regressive.

I recall that the Social Security payroll tax has a maximum amount it applies to. Let me think... I believe it's something like $160,000 or so, but I'm not exactly sure about the current limit. The point is, once your income exceeds this threshold, you don't pay the tax on the amount above it. So, for someone earning more than that limit, their tax is calculated only on the first part of their income, meaning a smaller percentage of their total income is taxed compared to someone earning less.

Looking at the options:

Option J says it's a flat tax that takes a smaller proportion as income rises. That sounds right because the rate is the same for all, but the amount taxed doesn't increase proportionally with higher incomes beyond the cap.

Option G says it's regressive because there's a dollar limit on income subject to tax. That's true in a way because the tax doesn't apply beyond a certain income, making higher earners pay a smaller percentage. But wait, is it the limit that makes it regressive, or the fact that the percentage decreases with higher income?

So, the payroll tax is a flat rate (like 12.4% split between employer and employee, but the employee only pays up to the wage cap). So, the employee's share is a fixed percentage up to the cap. So, someone earning $100,000 would pay 12.4% on the first $160k, but if they earn more, they only pay on the first $160k. So, their effective tax rate decreases as income increases beyond the cap.

So, it's a flat tax but with a cap, which makes it regressive because higher earners pay a smaller portion of their income. That aligns with option J, which mentions it's a flat tax taking a smaller proportion as income rises.

Option D says it only applies to the first $10k, which I think is incorrect because the cap is much higher than that. So D is not right.

Option E says it's regressive because it exempts investment income, which is true, but that's more about the tax base rather than the rate being regressive. Exempting investment income might make it less progressive, but the regressivity here is about the rate decreasing with higher income within the taxable portion.

Option J seems to capture the key point: the flat rate leads to a smaller proportion of income being taxed as you earn more. So the answer should be J.

The federal payroll tax for Social Security is regressive because it applies a flat tax rate to income up to a certain limit. This means higher-income individuals pay a smaller percentage of their total income in taxes compared to lower-income individuals, as the tax does not apply to income above the cap. This structure makes the tax regressive.

Answer: J
