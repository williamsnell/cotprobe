Okay, so I've got this economics question about cost curves when the price of capital increases. Let me try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that in the short run, firms have fixed and variable inputs. Fixed inputs, like capital (machines, factories), don't change in the short term, while variable inputs, like labor, can be adjusted. So, if the price of capital goes up, since it's fixed, the firm can't immediately change how much they use. But the cost of using it will go up.

Cost curves include things like average fixed cost (AFC), average variable cost (AVC), average total cost (ATC), and marginal cost (MC). 

AFC is fixed costs divided by quantity. If the price of capital increases, fixed costs increase. So AFC should go up. That means the AFC curve shifts upward.

AVC is variable costs divided by quantity. But variable costs are labor and other stuff that can be changed. Wait, capital is a fixed input, so an increase in its price affects fixed costs, not variable. So AVC should stay the same because the variable costs (like labor) aren't directly affected by the price of capital. Unless... wait, does capital affect the variable costs indirectly? Hmm, maybe not. Because in the short run, the firm can't change capital, so variable inputs are labor only. So AVC wouldn't shift because the price of capital is part of fixed costs.

ATC is AFC plus AVC. Since AFC increases and AVC stays the same, ATC must increase too. So the ATC curve shifts upward.

What about marginal cost (MC)? MC is the cost of producing one more unit, which is mainly affected by variable inputs. Since the price of capital doesn't affect variable costs in the short run, MC shouldn't change. Wait, but wait. MC is the derivative of the total cost. If total cost increases because fixed costs are higher, does that affect the MC curve? Let me think. MC is calculated based on the change in total variable cost. Since fixed costs are part of total costs, but MC is about the change in variable costs. So if fixed costs go up, the total cost goes up, but the MC curve itself (which depends on the slope of TVC) doesn't change because TVC is the same as before. So MC remains the same.

Wait, but some sources might say that if fixed costs increase, AFC increases, which affects ATC but not AVC or MC. So in this case, only AFC and ATC shift upward. So looking at the options:

Option I says average fixed cost and average total cost shift upward. That matches. Other options: Option A says AFC and MC shift up, but MC shouldn't change. Option F says all four shift up, which isn't right. Option I is looking good.

So the correct answer should be I.
</think>

When the annual price of capital increases, fixed costs rise because capital is a fixed input in the short run. This leads to an upward shift in the average fixed cost (AFC) curve and, consequently, the average total cost (ATC) curve, as ATC is the sum of AFC and average variable cost (AVC). However, since variable costs, which are labor-intensive, remain unaffected, the AVC and marginal cost (MC) curves do not shift. Therefore, only the AFC and ATC curves shift upward.

The correct answer is:

I: The average fixed cost and average total cost curves will shift upward.
