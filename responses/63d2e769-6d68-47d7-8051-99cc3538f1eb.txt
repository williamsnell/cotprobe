Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is asking for the smallest positive integer n (where n is greater than 1) such that the product of its positive divisors equals n^6. The options are given from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that the product of the divisors of a number relates to the number raised to the number of divisors divided by 2. Wait, was it something like that? Let me think. I think the formula is that if a number has k divisors, then the product of all the divisors is n^(k/2). Yeah, that sounds right. So if the product is n^6, then n^(k/2) = n^6. That would mean that k/2 = 6, so k = 12. So the number of divisors of n should be 12.

Wait, let me make sure I got that right. So, if the product is n^6, then according to the formula, n^(k/2) = n^6. So, yeah, k must be 12. That means n has 12 positive divisors. So now, I'm looking for the smallest n > 1 with exactly 12 divisors.

Okay, so I need to find the smallest n where the number of divisors is 12. Let me recall how the number of divisors works. The number of divisors function, often denoted as d(n), depends on the exponents in the prime factorization of n. If n is expressed as a product of primes raised to their exponents, like n = p1^a * p2^b * p3^c..., then the number of divisors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... etc.

So, I need to find the smallest n where the product of (a+1)(b+1)... equals 12. So, I need to find exponents a, b, c, etc., such that when each is increased by 1 and multiplied together, they equal 12.

Let me list the possible factorizations of 12 into integers greater than 1 because each (exponent +1) must be at least 2 (since exponents are at least 1 for primes). So, the possible ways to write 12 as a product of integers greater than 1 are:

1. 12 = 12
2. 12 = 6 * 2
3. 12 = 4 * 3
4. 12 = 3 * 2 * 2

These are the possible ways. Each of these corresponds to different prime factorizations of n.

Now, let's see what each case implies for n:

1. 12 = 12: This would mean that n is a single prime raised to the 11th power, because a+1 = 12 implies a = 11. So, n = p^11. The smallest such n would be 2^11 = 2048. That's one of the options (option A). But maybe there's a smaller n with more than one prime factor.

2. 12 = 6 * 2: Here, n would be p^5 * q^1, where p and q are distinct primes. The smallest such n would be 2^5 * 3^1 = 32 * 3 = 96. Hmm, 96 isn't one of the options. Wait, but maybe a smaller combination? Let me check another way.

Wait, if I take the exponents as 5 and 1, then the primes would be 2 and 3. So 2^5 *3^1=96. But maybe using higher primes gives a larger number, so 96 is the smallest for this case.

3. 12 =4 *3: So, n would be p^3 * q^2. Let's take the smallest primes, 2 and 3. So, 2^3 *3^2=8*9=72. 72 is one of the options (option F). That's smaller than 96.

4. 12=3*2*2: So, n would be p^2 * q^1 * r^1. Let's take the smallest primes: 2^2 *3^1 *5^1=4*3*5=60. 60 is an option (option C). That's even smaller than 72.

Wait, so let's list the possible n:

- Case 1: 2048
- Case 2: 96
- Case 3: 72
- Case 4: 60

So, the smallest among these is 60, which is option C. But wait, let me check if 60 is indeed the smallest possible.

Wait, but let me think again. Could there be a smaller number than 60 that has 12 divisors? Let's check the options given. The options include 30, 60, 72, 120, etc.

Wait, 30 is option B. Let's see how many divisors 30 has. 30 factors into 2 * 3 *5, so exponents are all 1. So, the number of divisors is (1+1)(1+1)(1+1)=2*2*2=8. So 8 divisors. That's less than 12, so 30 isn't suitable.

What about 60? 60 factors into 2^2 *3^1 *5^1. So, exponents are 2,1,1. So, the number of divisors is (2+1)(1+1)(1+1)=3*2*2=12. Yes, that's correct. So 60 has exactly 12 divisors.

Wait, but let me check the next smaller number in the options. The options are A:2048, B:30, C:60, D:120, E:36, F:72, G:20, H:12, I:10, J:64.

Wait, let me check the numbers below 60. For example, 36 is option E. 36 is 2^2 *3^2. So, exponents are 2 and 2. Number of divisors is (2+1)(2+1)=9. So, 9 divisors, which is less than 12. So, not enough.

What about 24? Wait, 24 isn't an option, but just for knowledge, 24 is 2^3 *3^1. So, (3+1)(1+1)=4*2=8 divisors.

What about 12? Option H is 12. 12 is 2^2 *3^1. So, (2+1)(1+1)=3*2=6 divisors. Not enough.

20 is option G. 20 is 2^2 *5^1. So, (2+1)(1+1)=6 divisors.

10 is option I. 10 is 2*5. So, (1+1)(1+1)=4 divisors.

64 is option J. 64 is 2^6. So, number of divisors is 6+1=7, which is less than 12.

So, the only number in the options that has exactly 12 divisors is 60 (option C) and 72 (option F), and 96 isn't an option. Wait, but I thought 60 is the smallest. Let me make sure there isn't a smaller number in the options that I'm missing.

Wait, the options are A:2048, B:30, C:60, D:120, E:36, F:72, G:20, H:12, I:10, J:64. So, the numbers less than 60 are 30,20,12,10,64. I've checked them all, and none have 12 divisors except 60.

Wait, but let me cross-verify. Let me calculate the number of divisors for each option that has a product of divisors equal to n^6. So, for each option, I can check if the product of its divisors is n^6.

Alternatively, since I already know that the number of divisors must be 12, I can just check which options have 12 divisors.

Option C:60. As I saw earlier, 60 has 12 divisors. So, the product of its divisors is 60^(12/2)=60^6, which is exactly the condition given.

Option F:72. 72's prime factorization is 2^3 *3^2. So, number of divisors is (3+1)(2+1)=4*3=12. So, yes, 72 also has 12 divisors. So, the product would be 72^6. But since 60 is smaller than 72, 60 is the better answer.

Wait, but let me check another thing. Is there a number smaller than 60 that has 12 divisors? Because if such a number exists, it might be an option not listed.

Wait, the smallest number with 12 divisors is 60. Because the possible factorizations are:

- 60 is 2^2 *3*5, which gives (2+1)(1+1)(1+1)=12.

- 72 is 2^3 *3^2, which gives (3+1)(2+1)=12.

- 84 is 2^2 *3*7, which would also have 12 divisors, but it's larger than 60.

- 90 is 2*3^2*5, which also has 12 divisors but is larger than 60.

So, 60 is indeed the smallest number with 12 divisors. So, among the options, 60 is the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier step. The product of the divisors is n^(d(n)/2). So, if d(n)=12, then the product is n^6. So, that's correct. Therefore, n must have 12 divisors.

So, the answer is 60, which is option C.
</think>

The problem requires finding the smallest integer \( n > 1 \) such that the product of its positive divisors equals \( n^6 \). The product of the divisors of \( n \) is given by \( n^{d(n)/2} \), where \( d(n) \) is the number of divisors of \( n \). Setting \( n^{d(n)/2} = n^6 \), we find \( d(n) = 12 \).

To find the smallest \( n \) with exactly 12 divisors, we consider the possible prime factorizations of \( n \) that yield 12 divisors. The smallest such \( n \) is 60, which factors as \( 2^2 \times 3 \times 5 \), giving \( (2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 12 \) divisors. Among the given options, 60 is the smallest number meeting this criterion.
