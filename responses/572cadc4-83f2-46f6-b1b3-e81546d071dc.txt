Question:

A state trooper was convicted in federal court in 2008 of taking bribes. He was sentenced to probation. He had served as a state trooper since 1978, and in 1998, he became fully qualified for his pension upon retirement. In 2006, the trooper retired and immediately started receiving monthly state pension checks. In 2009, the governor of the state signed into law a statute, which provided in part:"Section 8. Any member of the state law enforcement staff. . . who is convicted of. . . briberyshall not be entitled to receive any retirement or other benefit or payment of any kind from the stateSuch conviction shall be considered a breach of the staff member's employment contractSection 12. The provisions of this Act shall be retroactive to December 31, 1975. Section 14. This Act shall take effect immediately. "Following the enactment of the statute, the state trooper received a letter from the state which stated that pursuant to the statute, the state is immediately discontinuing pension benefit payments to you on account of your 2008 bribery conviction. "The trooper contacted an attorney, who challenged the discontinuance of benefits on the grounds that the new law was unconstitutional. Assume that the state's highest court holds the statute constitutional. The trooper might still be able to eventually have his pension reinstated if

Options:

A: he can prove that the bribe was unrelated to his duties as a state trooper.
B: he can show that he was convicted before the effective date of thestatute.
C: he can prove that the statute is being applied selectively and discriminately.
D: he can show that the discontinuance of benefits is a form of double jeopardy.
E: he receives a presidential pardon for his bribery offense.
F: he can demonstrate that the statute unfairly targets retired law enforcement officials.
G: he can demonstrate that his conviction was overturned on appeal.
H: he exercises his constitutional right to discretionary review in the U. S. Supreme Court.
I: he can show that the statute violates the dormant commerce clause.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let me read through it carefully.

The scenario is about a state trooper who was convicted of taking bribes in federal court in 2008. He was sentenced to probation. He retired in 2006 and started receiving his state pension. Then, in 2009, the governor signed a new statute that says if a state law enforcement member is convicted of bribery, they can't receive any retirement benefits. The statute is retroactive to December 31, 1975, and takes effect immediately.

Because of this, the state sent a letter stopping his pension benefits. His attorney is challenging this, saying the law is unconstitutional. But the state's highest court says the statute is constitutional. Now, the question is, under what circumstances might the trooper still have his pension reinstated?

Looking at the options, I need to figure out which one could allow him to get his pension back.

First, let's break down the statute. It says that if someone is convicted of bribery, they lose their retirement benefits. It's retroactive to 1975, so it applies even if the conviction happened in 2008. But when did the statute take effect? It says it takes effect immediately, so when the governor signed it in 2009, it became law right away.

Wait, but the trooper retired in 2006. So the pension was already being paid before the statute was enacted. The statute is retroactive, meaning it applies to events before its enactment. But does that apply to benefits that were already being paid?

I remember that in constitutional law, there's the Ex Post Facto Clause, which prohibits laws that retroactively criminalize actions or take away rights. But this isn't a criminal law; it's about benefits. Hmm, but wait, the state is taking away a benefit he was already receiving. Does that violate the ex post facto clause?

Wait, the Ex Post Facto Clause applies to criminal laws, making something a crime that wasn't before, or increasing the punishment retroactively. But this is a civil law affecting a pension. I think in some cases, the Supreme Court has allowed retroactive application of such laws because they're not criminal in nature. So if the state's highest court says it's constitutional, maybe the Ex Post Facto argument doesn't hold, but that's not one of the options.

Looking at the options:

A: Prove bribe was unrelated to duties. That might go to whether the conviction affects his pension, but if the statute applies to any conviction of bribery regardless of relation, this might not help. Plus, the question says he was convicted, so it's about the punishment affecting his pension.

B: Show convicted before the statute's effective date. The statute was signed in 2009, so the effective date is when? It says it takes effect immediately upon enactment. The conviction was in 2008, which is before the statute's effective date. So if the statute applies only to convictions after its effective date, then maybe. But wait, the statute says it's retroactive to 1975, so it applies to events before 1975. But the conviction is in 2008, after 1975, so it's covered. So option B says he was convicted before the statute's effective date, which is 2009. So that's true. But does that matter? If the statute is retroactive, it might still apply even if the conviction was before the law was passed. So maybe B isn't the answer.

C: Show statute is applied selectively. That's about equal protection, but unless there's proof of discrimination, this might not work. The statute applies to all similarly situated individuals, so unless it's shown that others weren't targeted, this might not be a strong argument.

D: Discontinuing benefits is double jeopardy. Double jeopardy applies to criminal cases, preventing multiple prosecutions for the same offense. But this is about losing a pension, which is a civil penalty, not criminal. So double jeopardy doesn't apply here. So D is incorrect.

E: Presidential pardon. A pardon would forgive the conviction, but does it restore pension benefits? I'm not sure. Pardons typically remove criminal consequences, but whether the pension would be reinstated might depend on state law. But the question is about the statute's constitutionality. If the statute is constitutional, getting a pardon might not directly affect the pension unless the state law allows it. But the question says the state's highest court upheld the statute, so maybe a pardon wouldn't necessarily reinstate the pension. Plus, the option is about a pardon, but the question is about the trooper's ability to have the pension reinstated. So E might not be the right answer.

F: Statute unfairly targets retired law enforcement. That could be an equal protection or selective enforcement argument. If the law is singling out retired officials, it might be discriminatory. But the statute applies to all state law enforcement, so if it's written generally, it might not be seen as targeting retired officials specifically. Unless the wording suggests otherwise, F might not be the answer.

G: Conviction overturned on appeal. If his conviction is reversed, then the basis for stopping the pension would disappear. So if he can prove his conviction was wrong, he might get the pension back. That seems plausible. So G is a possibility.

H: Exercise right to review in Supreme Court. That's about appealing the state court's decision. If the state's highest court upholds the statute, going to the Supreme Court might be an option, but that doesn't directly lead to reinstatement unless the Supreme Court reverses it. But the question is asking under what circumstances he might still have his pension reinstated. So H is more about the process, not the grounds for reinstatement.

I: Dormant commerce clause. That's about states not passing laws that unduly burden interstate commerce. This situation seems more about state employees and pensions, so I don't see how the dormant commerce clause applies here. So I is unlikely.

So, going back, the key is whether the statute's retroactive application affects his pension. The statute says it's retroactive to 1975, so it applies to any conviction after that date, including his 2008 conviction. But he retired in 2006, before the statute was enacted. So when the statute was passed in 2009, it took effect immediately, but because it's retroactive, it applies to his 2008 conviction.

However, if the statute's effective date is 2009, and the conviction was in 2008, which is before the statute was law. So under the statute's wording, it's retroactive, so it applies to convictions on or after 1975. So the statute applies to his 2008 conviction.

But option B says he can show he was convicted before the effective date of the statute. The effective date is when the statute was enacted, 2009. His conviction was in 2008, so yes, before. So if the statute's effective date is 2009, then the conviction was before. But the statute is retroactive, meaning it applies to events before 2009. So even if the conviction was before, the statute applies to it.

Wait, but the statute says "shall be retroactive to December 31, 1975," so it applies to any conviction on or after 1975. So his 2008 conviction is covered. So option B, which says he can show the conviction was before the statute's effective date, is correct because the statute's effective date is 2009, so the conviction was before that. But does that matter? Because the statute is retroactive, it still applies. So maybe B isn't the answer because the statute's retroactivity overrides that.

Wait, but if the statute is applied retroactively to take away benefits he was already receiving, that might raise a constitutional issue, but the state's highest court has already upheld it. So the trooper can't challenge that anymore.

So looking again, the only options left are G and B. G is about overturning the conviction, which would remove the basis for stopping the pension. B is about the conviction being before the statute's effective date, but since the statute is retroactive, that might not prevent the application.

Wait, but the statute says it's retroactive to 1975, so it applies to any conviction after 1975, regardless of when the statute was passed. So the trooper's conviction in 2008 is after 1975, so the statute applies. Therefore, option B is not a valid reason because the statute is retroactive.

So the only other option is G: he can demonstrate that his conviction was overturned on appeal. If the conviction is overturned, then the state can't use it to deny the pension. So that would reinstate his pension.

Therefore, the answer is G.

The state trooper might still have his pension reinstated if he can demonstrate that his conviction was overturned on appeal, as this would remove the basis for the state's action in discontinuing his benefits.

Answer: G
