Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about quasi-experimental designs and how they differ from true experimental designs. I'm a bit rusty on my research methods, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

First, I remember that experimental designs are about cause and effect, right? They try to establish whether an intervention causes a particular outcome. True experiments usually have a lot of control, like random assignment of participants to groups. That way, any differences between the groups can be attributed to the intervention rather than other factors.

Quasi-experimental designs, on the other hand, are similar but lack some of the controls. They often don't use random assignment, which makes them less rigorous than true experiments. I think they might use things like comparison groups, but not in the same way.

The question is asking what distinguishes quasi-experimental from true experimental designs. The options are A through J. Let me go through each one.

Option A: Implementation of the intervention by the researcher. I think both quasi and true experiments involve the researcher implementing the intervention. So this might not be the key difference.

Option B: Pre-determined assignment of participants to groups. Wait, isn't that more about how groups are formed? In true experiments, assignment is random and pre-determined, but quasi might not do that. Hmm, maybe this is relevant, but I'm not sure yet.

Option C: Use of a non-comparison group. I'm not sure. Quasi-experimental designs sometimes use comparison groups, but maybe not always. Not sure if this is the main point of difference.

Option D: Use of multiple measures of outcome. Both designs could use multiple measures, so this might not be it.

Option E: Use of a single group of participants. No, because both can use multiple groups. For example, a quasi-experiment might have a treatment group and a non-equivalent control group.

Option F: Use of valid and reliable measures. Both should use valid and reliable measures, so this isn't the distinguishing factor.

Option G: Random assignment of participants to groups. Oh, I think this is key. True experiments use random assignment, whereas quasi-experiments don't. So the presence or absence of random assignment is a big difference.

Option H: Use of non-random selection from the population. Wait, this is about how participants are selected. True experiments might randomly select participants, but quasi might not. But I think the main difference is in assignment, not selection. Or maybe selection is part of it.

Option I: Use of control or comparison groups. Both designs often have control groups, but quasi-experiments might have non-equivalent control groups. But I'm not sure if this is the main point of distinction.

Option J: Random selection of participants from the population. This is about sampling. True experiments might use random sampling, but quasi might not. But again, I think the key difference is in the assignment within the study, not the sampling method.

Wait, so the question is about what distinguishes quasi-experimental from true experimental designs. The main feature I remember is that true experiments have random assignment to groups, whereas quasi-experiments don't. So the presence of random assignment is the key difference.

Looking back at the options, option G is "random assignment of participants to groups." So that's the correct answer because quasi-experiments don't have this, whereas true experiments do.

I think that's it. So the answer should be G.

The key distinction between quasi-experimental and true experimental designs lies in the use of random assignment to groups. True experimental designs employ random assignment, ensuring that groups are equivalent at the start, while quasi-experimental designs often lack this feature, relying instead on non-equivalent control groups or other methods. 

Answer: G
