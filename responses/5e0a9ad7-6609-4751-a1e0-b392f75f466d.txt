Alright, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says that protons, each with a mass of 1.67 × 10^-27 kg, are moving at a velocity of 2 × 10^7 m/s. They strike a target that's 1 gram in mass and has a specific heat capacity of 0.334 cal/(g·°C). The proton stream corresponds to a current of 4.8 microAmp. We need to find the initial rate at which the temperature of the target rises, given that one-third of the protons' energy is converted into heat.

Okay, so first, I think I need to find the energy each proton has and then figure out how much of that energy goes into heating the target. Then, using the specific heat capacity, I can find the temperature change rate.

Let me break it down:

1. **Find the kinetic energy of each proton.**
   Kinetic energy (KE) is (1/2)mv². So, m is 1.67e-27 kg, v is 2e7 m/s.

   Let me calculate that:
   KE = 0.5 * 1.67e-27 kg * (2e7 m/s)^2
   The square of 2e7 is 4e14, so KE = 0.5 * 1.67e-27 * 4e14
   0.5 * 4e14 is 2e14. So, KE = 1.67e-27 * 2e14 = 3.34e-13 J per proton.

2. **Convert this energy into calories because the specific heat is in cal/(g·°C).**
   I remember that 1 cal is about 4.184 J. So, to convert Joules to calories, divide by 4.184.

   So, 3.34e-13 J / 4.184 ≈ 7.98e-14 cal per proton.

3. **Only one-third of this energy is converted into heat.**
   So, heat energy per proton is (1/3) * 7.98e-14 ≈ 2.66e-14 cal.

4. **Now, find the number of protons striking the target per second.**
   The current is given as 4.8 microAmp. Current (I) is charge (Q) per time. So, I = Q/t. Since each proton has charge +e (1.6e-19 C), the number of protons per second (N) is I/(e).

   So, I = 4.8e-6 A. Each proton contributes e = 1.6e-19 C. Therefore, N = (4.8e-6 C/s) / (1.6e-19 C) = 3e13 protons per second.

5. **Calculate the total heat energy deposited per second.**
   Each proton contributes 2.66e-14 cal, and there are 3e13 protons per second.

   So, heat per second (Q/t) = 3e13 * 2.66e-14 = 0.8 cal/s.

6. **Now, use the formula Q = mcΔT to find the temperature change rate (ΔT/t).**
   Here, m is 1 gram, c is 0.334 cal/(g·°C), and Q/t is 0.8 cal/s.

   Rearranging, ΔT/t = (Q/t) / (m*c) = 0.8 / (1 * 0.334) ≈ 2.393 °C/s.

So, the temperature rises at approximately 2.39°C per second. Looking at the options, J is 2.39°C. So the answer should be J.
