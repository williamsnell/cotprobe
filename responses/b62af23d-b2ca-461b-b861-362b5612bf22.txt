Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out the total number of folders the teacher bought. Let me read it carefully again.

The teacher buys two types of folders: red and blue. For the red ones, there are 5 boxes, each containing 36 folders. For the blue ones, there are 6 boxes, each with 32 folders. I need to find the total number of folders and then determine which option is closest to that total.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I should calculate the total number of red folders. That's 5 boxes multiplied by 36 folders per box. Let me do that multiplication. 5 times 36... Well, 5 times 30 is 150, and 5 times 6 is 30, so adding those together gives me 180. So, the teacher bought 180 red folders.

Next, I'll calculate the blue folders. There are 6 boxes, each with 32 folders. So, 6 times 32. Let me think: 6 times 30 is 180, and 6 times 2 is 12. Adding those together gives 192. So, the teacher bought 192 blue folders.

Now, to find the total number of folders, I need to add the red and blue folders together. That's 180 plus 192. Let's see, 180 + 192. I can add 180 + 190 first, which is 370, and then add the remaining 2 to get 372. So, the total is 372 folders.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the red folders: 5 boxes * 36 folders. 5*36 is indeed 180. For the blue folders: 6*32 is 192. Adding 180 and 192 gives 372. That seems correct.

Now, looking at the options provided:

A: 460  
B: 340  
C: 500  
D: 520  
E: 600  
F: 440  
G: 275  
H: 550  
I: 420  
J: 380  

I need to find which number is closest to 372. Let's look at the options around 372. The options are J:380, which is 8 more than 372, and B:340, which is 32 less. Then there's I:420, which is 48 more. So, J is 380, which is closer to 372 than the others nearby. The other options are either much lower or higher. For example, 340 is 32 away, while 380 is only 8 away. So, 380 is the closest.

Wait, but let me make sure there's no option closer than J. Let me list the options in order:

275 (G), 340 (B), 380 (J), 420 (I), 440 (F), 460 (A), 500 (C), 520 (D), 550 (H), 600 (E).

So between 340 and 420, 380 is just 8 away. 340 is 32 away. So yes, 380 is the closest.

But wait, another thought: sometimes when the number is exactly halfway between two options, we round up, but here 372 is closer to 380 than to 340. So, the answer should be J:380.

The teacher bought a total of 372 folders. The closest option is J:380.
