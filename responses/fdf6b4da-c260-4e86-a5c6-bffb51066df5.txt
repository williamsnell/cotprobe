Okay, so I need to calculate the value of the universal gravitational constant G. Hmm, I remember that G is involved in Newton's law of universal gravitation, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Wait, Newton's law is F = G*(M*m)/r², right? So G relates the gravitational force between two masses.

The problem gives me the Earth's radius and average density. I think density is mass over volume, so maybe I can find the mass of the Earth from that. Oh yeah, density ρ = M/V, so M = ρV. And the volume of a sphere is given as (4/3)πr³. Got it.

Let me write down the given values. The Earth's radius R is 6.4 × 10^6 meters. The average density ρ is 5.5 × 10^3 kg/m³. So I can compute the mass M using M = ρ * V. Volume V is (4/3)πR³. 

Calculating V first. Let me compute R³: (6.4e6)^3. Let's see, 6.4 cubed is 262.144, and then times 10^18 (since (10^6)^3 is 10^18). So V ≈ (4/3) * π * 262.144e18. Let me compute that step by step.

First, (4/3) is approximately 1.3333. Multiplying by π gives about 4.1888. Then multiply by 262.144e18: 4.1888 * 262.144 ≈ 1100. So V is roughly 1100e18 m³, which is 1.1e21 m³. Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check that calculation because 6.4e6 cubed is (6.4)^3 = 262.144, so 262.144e18 m³. Then (4/3)π times that is (4/3)*3.1416 ≈ 4.1888, so 4.1888 * 262.144e18 = about (4 * 262) = 1048, and 0.1888*262≈50, so total around 1100e18 m³, which is 1.1e21 m³. Hmm, that seems right.

Now, multiply by density to get mass M. Density is 5.5e3 kg/m³. So M = ρ * V = 5.5e3 * 1.1e21. Let me calculate that: 5.5 * 1.1 is about 6.05, so 6.05e24 kg. Wait, 5.5e3 * 1.1e21 = (5.5 * 1.1) * 10^(3+21) = 6.05e24 kg. That seems correct.

Now, how does this help me find G? I'm a bit stuck here. Oh wait, maybe I'm supposed to use the formula for gravitational acceleration at the surface of the Earth. Because I remember that g = G*M / R². Oh right, because if you consider an object of mass m on Earth's surface, the gravitational force is F = G*M*m / R², and F = m*g, so g = G*M/R². So rearranging, G = (g * R²) / M.

Wait, but I don't have g given here. Oh wait, no, I think the question expects me to compute G using the given density and radius. Alternatively, perhaps a different approach is intended. Maybe I should use the formula for gravitational acceleration in terms of density.

Wait, another approach: Using the formula g = (4/3)πGρR. Because I remember that when you have a uniform sphere, the gravitational acceleration at the surface can be written as g = (4/3)πGρR. Let me verify that. Oh yes, because M = (4/3)πR³ρ, so substituting into g = G*M/R² gives (4/3)πGρ R³/R² = (4/3)πGρ R. So that's correct.

So if I have g, I can rearrange to solve for G. But wait, I don't have g given. Oh, wait, I know that the standard value of g is about 9.8 m/s², but maybe I'm supposed to use that here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute G without using g, but that seems confusing.

Wait, maybe the problem is asking for G given the Earth's density and radius, but without knowing g. Hmm. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem says to calculate G, so perhaps using the known formula involving density and radius. Let me try that.

Given that g = (4/3)πGρR, I can solve for G: G = (g * 3) / (4πρR). But since I don't have g, I can't use this formula unless I'm allowed to take g as 9.8 m/s². Alternatively, perhaps I should use the standard value of g.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give g. So maybe I'm supposed to compute G using the given R and ρ, but perhaps another approach. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for gravitational acceleration at Earth's surface, which is g = G*M/R². I can compute M as ρ*(4/3)πR³, so substituting into g:

g = G*(ρ*(4/3)πR³) / R² = G*ρ*(4/3)π R.

Which rearranges to G = (3g)/(4πρ R). So if I have g, I can compute G. But wait, I don't have g in the problem. So maybe I'm supposed to assume that g is 9.8 m/s², which is the standard value.

So let me proceed with that assumption. Let me write down the formula:

G = (3g) / (4πρ R).

Given:
g = 9.8 m/s²,
ρ = 5.5e3 kg/m³,
R = 6.4e6 m.

Plugging in the numbers:

G = (3 * 9.8) / (4 * π * 5.5e3 * 6.4e6).

Let me compute the numerator and denominator step by step.

Numerator: 3 * 9.8 = 29.4.

Denominator: 4 * π ≈ 12.566. Multiply by 5.5e3: 12.566 * 5.5e3 ≈ 69,113. Then multiply by 6.4e6: 69,113 * 6.4e6.

Wait, let me compute this carefully.

First, 4 * π is approximately 12.56637061.

Multiply by 5.5e3 kg/m³: 12.56637061 * 5.5e3 = 12.56637061 * 5500 = let's compute 12 * 5500 = 66,000, and 0.56637 * 5500 ≈ 3,115. So total is approximately 69,115.

Then multiply by 6.4e6 m: 69,115 * 6.4e6. Let me compute 69,115 *6.4 = 69,115 *6=414,690; 69,115 *0.4=27,646. So total is 414,690 +27,646=442,336. So 442,336e6? Wait, wait, no. Wait, 6.4e6 is 6.4 million, so 6.4e6 = 6.4 * 10^6. So 69,115 * 6.4e6 = 69,115 *6.4 * 10^6.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 69,115 *6.4e6 = 6.9115e4 *6.4e6 = (6.9115 *6.4) * 1e10. 6.9115 *6.4 is approximately 44.2336. So denominator is approximately 44.2336e10, which is 4.42336e11.

So denominator is 4.42336e11.

So G = 29.4 / (4.42336e11) ≈ 29.4 / 4.42336e11.

Compute 29.4 / 4.42336e11.

Well, 29.4 /4.42336 ≈ 6.645, so 6.645e-11 N m²/kg².

Looking at the options, option D is 6.7 ×10^-11, which is very close. Option F is 7.0e-11, which is a bit higher. So the correct answer should be D.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes approximations can throw things off.

Let me recalculate the denominator more accurately.

First, 4 * π = approx 12.56637.

12.56637 *5.5e3 = 12.56637 *5500.

12 *5500 = 66,000.

0.56637 *5500 = let's compute 0.5 *5500=2750, 0.06637*5500≈365. So total is 2750+365=3115.

So total 66,000 +3,115=69,115.

Then, 69,115 *6.4e6 = 69,115 *6.4 *1e6.

Compute 69,115 *6.4:

69,115 *6 = 414,690.

69,115 *0.4=27,646.

Total: 414,690 +27,646=442,336.

So 442,336 *1e6 = 4.42336e11.

So denominator is 4.42336e11.

Numerator: 3*9.8=29.4.

So G=29.4 /4.42336e11.

29.4 /4.42336e11 = (29.4 /4.42336) *1e-11.

Compute 29.4 /4.42336:

Approximately, 4.42336 *6=26.54016, which is less than 29.4. 4.42336*6.6=29.190. So 6.6 gives about 29.19, which is close to 29.4.

So 29.4 /4.42336 ≈6.645.

So G≈6.645e-11 Nm²/kg².

Looking at the options, option D is 6.7e-11, which matches closely.

To calculate the universal gravitational constant \( G \), we use the formula derived from the gravitational acceleration at the Earth's surface:

\[
g = \frac{4}{3} \pi G \rho R
\]

Rearranging for \( G \):

\[
G = \frac{3g}{4\pi \rho R}
\]

Given:
- \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) (assumed standard value),
- \( \rho = 5.5 \times 10^3 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \),
- \( R = 6.4 \times 10^6 \, \text{m} \).

Substituting the values:

\[
G = \frac{3 \cdot 9.8}{4 \cdot \pi \cdot 5.5 \times 10^3 \cdot 6.4 \times 10^6}
\]

1. **Numerator**: \( 3 \cdot 9.8 = 29.4 \).
2. **Denominator**: 
   - \( 4 \cdot \pi \approx 12.566 \),
   - \( 12.566 \cdot 5.5 \times 10^3 \approx 69,115 \),
   - \( 69,115 \cdot 6.4 \times 10^6 \approx 4.42336 \times 10^{11} \).

Thus:

\[
G = \frac{29.4}{4.42336 \times 10^{11}} \approx 6.645 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{Nm}^2/\text{kg}^2
\]

The closest option is **D: \( 6.7 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{Nm}^2/\text{kg}^2 \)**.
