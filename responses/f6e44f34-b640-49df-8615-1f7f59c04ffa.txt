Question:

Every day Melanie spends her lunch money consuming apples, at $1 each, and oranges, at $2 each. At her current level of consumption, Melanie's marginal utility of apples is 12 and her marginal utility of oranges is 18. If she has already spent all of her lunch money, how should Melanie change her consumption decision to maximize utility?

Options:

A: She should make no changes; she is consuming the utility maximizing combination of apples and oranges.
B: She should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both.
C: She should spend all her money on apples since they are cheaper.
D: She should save her lunch money instead of spending it on apples and oranges.
E: She should continue consuming apples and oranges at the same rate, regardless of marginal utility.
F: She should decrease her apple consumption and increase her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both.
G: She should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the marginal utility is equal for both.
H: She should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the total utility is maximized, regardless of the price.
I: She should spend all her money on oranges as they have higher marginal utility.
J: She should decrease her apple consumption and increase her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar of oranges is twice that of apples.

Okay, so I've got this economics problem here about Melanie and her lunch money. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my microeconomics, but I'll do my best.

Alright, Melanie spends her lunch money on apples and oranges. Apples cost $1 each, and oranges are $2 each. Right now, her marginal utility (MU) from apples is 12, and from oranges it's 18. The question is asking how she should change her consumption to maximize utility, given she's already spent all her money.

Hmm, I remember that to maximize utility, the consumer should allocate their budget such that the marginal utility per dollar spent is equal for all goods. That is, the ratio of MU to price should be the same for apples and oranges. So the formula is MU_apple / Price_apple = MU_orange / Price_orange.

Let me plug in the numbers. Currently, MU_apple is 12, and the price is $1, so MU_apple / $1 = 12. For oranges, MU_orange is 18, and the price is $2, so MU_orange / $2 = 9. Wait, so 12 vs. 9. That means apples give more marginal utility per dollar than oranges.

Since apples have a higher MU per dollar, Melanie should reallocate her spending to buy more apples and fewer oranges. Because by doing so, she can increase her overall utility. She's not maximizing yet because the ratios aren't equal.

Wait, but the current situation is that she's already spent all her money. So she can't just have more apples without adjusting her consumption. So she needs to adjust her consumption by buying more apples and less oranges until the MU per dollar equals.

Looking at the options, option B says she should increase apple consumption and decrease orange until MU per dollar is equal. That makes sense because apples currently give a better MU per dollar. Alternatively, option F says the oppositeâ€”decrease apples and increase oranges. But since apples have higher MU per dollar, she should buy more apples.

Let me double-check: if she buys more apples, the MU of apples will decrease (because of diminishing marginal utility), and buying fewer oranges will increase their MU (since you have less, each additional one gives more utility). So the two MUs will adjust until their MU per dollar is equal. So option B is correct.

Other options: Option A says she's already at the optimal point, but since MU per dollar isn't equal, that's not true. Option C suggests buying only apples because they're cheaper, but that ignores the utility aspect. Option I says buy only oranges because higher MU, but again, price matters. So options C and I are incorrect. Option D is about saving money, which isn't relevant here because she's already spent all her money. Options E, H, J don't make sense based on what I know. So the correct answer is B.

To maximize utility, Melanie should ensure that the marginal utility per dollar spent on apples equals that on oranges. Currently, apples offer a higher marginal utility per dollar (12) compared to oranges (9). Therefore, she should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both. 

Answer: B
