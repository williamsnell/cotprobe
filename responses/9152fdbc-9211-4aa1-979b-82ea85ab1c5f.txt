Okay, so I've got this problem here with two linear equations, and I'm supposed to solve them using Cramer's Rule. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to remember how it works. 

The equations are:

1. 2x + 3y = 10
2. 4x + 4y = 12

Hmm, Cramer's Rule is a method that uses determinants to solve systems of linear equations. I think it works for systems where there are as many equations as variables, which is the case here since we have two equations and two variables.

First, I need to write the system in matrix form. The coefficients of x and y form the coefficient matrix. So the coefficient matrix should be:

| 2   3 |
| 4   4 |

And the constants on the right side are [10, 12]. 

Cramer's Rule says that if the determinant of the coefficient matrix (let's call it D) is not zero, then the system has a unique solution. The solutions for x and y can be found by replacing the respective columns with the constants and then taking the determinants of those new matrices (D_x and D_y) and dividing by D.

So, let's compute D first. The determinant of a 2x2 matrix |a b; c d| is ad - bc.

D = (2)(4) - (3)(4) = 8 - 12 = -4. Okay, so D is -4. Since it's not zero, we can proceed.

Next, to find x, we replace the first column (the x coefficients) with the constants [10, 12]. So the new matrix for D_x is:

|10   3|
|12   4|

The determinant D_x is (10)(4) - (3)(12) = 40 - 36 = 4. So x = D_x / D = 4 / (-4) = -1.

Wait, that seems different from some of the options I'm looking at. Let me check that again. Hmm, 10*4 is 40, 3*12 is 36, so 40-36 is indeed 4. Then 4 divided by -4 is -1. So x is -1.

Now for y, we replace the second column with the constants. So the matrix D_y is:

|2   10|
|4   12|

The determinant D_y is (2)(12) - (10)(4) = 24 - 40 = -16. So y = D_y / D = (-16)/(-4) = 4.

Wait, so x is -1 and y is 4. Let me look at the options. Option B is [-1,4]. So that should be the answer.

But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me plug these values back into the original equations to verify.

First equation: 2*(-1) + 3*(4) = -2 + 12 = 10. That matches the first equation.

Second equation: 4*(-1) + 4*(4) = -4 + 16 = 12. That also matches the second equation.

Okay, so it checks out. I think I did it right. So the solution is x = -1 and y = 4, which is option B.

The solution is found using Cramer's Rule. The determinant of the coefficient matrix is -4. Replacing the respective columns with the constants gives determinants of 4 and -16, leading to x = -1 and y = 4. Verification confirms these values satisfy both equations.

Answer: B
