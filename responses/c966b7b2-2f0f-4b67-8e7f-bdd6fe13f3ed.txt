Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Read the excerpts below.
This corruption is repeatedly designated by Paul by the term sin . . . such as adultery, fornication, theft, hatred, murder, revellings, he terms, in the same way, the fruits of sin, though in various passages of Scripture . . . we are, merely on account of such corruption, deservedly condemned by God, to whom nothing is acceptable but righteousness, innocence, and purity.
—John Calvin, from The Institutes of Christian Religion, Book 2: Chapter 1, 1545
The covenant of life is not preached equally to all, and among those to whom it is preached, does not always meet with the same reception. This diversity displays the unsearchable depth of the divine judgment, and is without doubt subordinate to God's purpose of eternal election. But if it is plainly owing to the mere pleasure of God that salvation is spontaneously offered to some, while others have no access to it, great and difficult questions immediately arise, questions which are inexplicable, when just views are not entertained concerning election and predestination[,] . . . the grace of God being illustrated by the contrast, viz., that he does not adopt all promiscuously to the hope of salvation, but gives to some what he denies to others.
—John Calvin, from The Institutes of Christian Religion, Book 3: Chapter 21, 1545

D: Religion was used to challenge the authority of earthly monarchs.
E: The corruption of the Roman Catholic Church and its leaders meant that reform was needed.

G: The notion that salvation is predetermined and not all individuals have access to it.
H: The idea that churches should be self-governed and independent.
I: The idea that religious teachings should be made available in the vernacular rather than in Latin.

Okay, so I have to figure out which justification used by Protestant reformers like Calvin is being referred to in the given excerpts. Let me read the question again and the options carefully.

The question is asking about the justifications used by reformers, specifically Calvin, based on the two excerpts provided. Let me look at the excerpts one by one.

The first excerpt talks about sin being repeatedly designated by Paul and lists various sins. It mentions that because of this corruption, people are deservedly condemned by God, who only accepts righteousness, innocence, and purity. So this seems to be about the nature of sin and human depravity, possibly leading to the idea of salvation needing to come through God's grace.

The second excerpt discusses the covenant of life not being preached equally. It says that among those to whom it is preached, the reception varies, which displays the depth of God's judgment and is subordinate to God's purpose of eternal election. It also states that salvation is offered to some spontaneously, while others have no access, leading to questions about election and predestination. This seems to be about predestination and the idea that God's grace is not given to everyone equally.

So, putting this together, the excerpts are talking about the concepts of sin and predestination. Now, looking at the options provided, I need to match these ideas.

Option G says: The notion that salvation is predetermined and not all individuals have access to it. That sounds exactly like what the second excerpt is talking about—predestination, where some are elected for salvation and others are not.

Option J is about salvation through faith alone, which is another Calvinist doctrine, but the excerpts don't directly mention that. The first excerpt is more about sin, and the second about predestination.

Option E is about the corruption of the Catholic Church needing reform, which is a key point of the Reformation, but the excerpts don't discuss the church's corruption; they focus more on salvation and predestination.

Option G seems to fit better because the second excerpt specifically discusses God's election and the unequal distribution of salvation, which is the essence of predestination.

The excerpts discuss the idea of predestination, where salvation is predetermined by God and not available to everyone. This aligns with Calvin's belief in God's eternal election. 

Answer: G
