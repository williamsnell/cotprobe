Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the input, output, and efficiency of a machine based on the given nameplate ratings. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the machine is rated at 110 volts and 38.5 amperes, and it's a 5 horsepower motor. I remember that horsepower can be converted to watts to make things easier, since power calculations are more straightforward in watts.

I think the formula to convert horsepower (HP) to watts is something like 1 HP equals 746 watts. So for 5 HP, it should be 5 times 746. Let me calculate that: 5 * 746 equals 3730 watts. So the output power is 3730 watts. Wait, no, because that's the mechanical output, right? Because the nameplate gives the input in volts and amps, which is the electrical input, and the horsepower is the mechanical output.

So, the input power is calculated using P = V * I. The voltage is 110 volts, and the current is 38.5 amperes. So P = 110 * 38.5. Let me do the math: 110 times 38 is 4180, and 110 times 0.5 is 55, so adding those gives 4235 watts. So the input power is 4235 watts.

The output power is the 5 HP converted to watts, which I think is 3730 watts as I calculated earlier. Now, efficiency is the output divided by the input, multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. So efficiency is (3730 / 4235) * 100.

Let me compute that: 3730 divided by 4235. Hmm, 3730 ÷ 4235 is approximately 0.88, so multiplying by 100 gives about 88% efficiency. Wait, but looking at the options, I need to check which one matches input 4235, output 3730, and efficiency around 88%.

Looking at option C: Input is 4350, output 3730, efficiency 85.7%. That's not matching. Option A has input 4235, output 3600, which is lower than 3730. Option F has input 4230, output 3650, which is also lower. Option I has input 4385, output 3750, which is higher than our calculated output. Hmm, none of these seem to exactly match.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the calculations. Oh wait, 1 HP is 746 watts, so 5 HP is 5 * 746 = 3730 watts. That's correct. Input is 110V * 38.5A = 4235W. So efficiency is 3730 / 4235 ≈ 0.881, which is about 88.1%. Looking again at the options, none of them have exactly that. Let me check each option.

Option C: Input 4350, Output 3730. Efficiency would be 3730/4350 ≈ 85.7%, which doesn't match. Option I: Input 4385, Output 3750. Efficiency is 3750/4385 ≈ 85.5%, which is close but not exact. Option F: Input 4230, Output 3650. Efficiency is 3650/4230 ≈ 86.3%. Wait, but our calculation was 88.1%, which isn't matching any of the options exactly. Did I make a mistake in the output?

Wait, perhaps I got the output wrong. Wait, the nameplate says 5 HP, which is the mechanical output. So the input is electrical, which is 4235W. So the output should be 3730W. So the efficiency is 3730/4235 ≈ 88.1%. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option C has input 4350, output 3730. Efficiency is 3730/4350 ≈ 85.7%. That's not matching. Option I has higher input and higher output. Hmm. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all options again:

Option A: 4235 input, 3600 output → 3600/4235 ≈ 85% efficiency.

Option B: 4500 input, 4000 output → 4000/4500 ≈ 88.9%.

Option C: 4350,3730 → 85.7%.

Option D: 4100,3450 → 84.1%.

Option E: 4200,3900 → 93%? No, 3900/4200 is 93% which seems high.

Option F: 4230,3650 → 3650/4230 ≈ 86.3%.

Option G: 4300,3700 → 3700/4300 ≈ 86%.

Option H: 4400,3500 → 79.5%.

Option I: 4385,3750 → 3750/4385 ≈ 85.5%.

Option J: 4500,3800 → ≈84%.

Wait, none of the options have 4235 input, 3730 output, and 88.1% efficiency. But option B has input 4500, output 4000, efficiency 88.9%. That's close but not exactly matching. Did I miscalculate the input? Let me check 110 * 38.5 again.

110 * 38 = 4180, 110 * 0.5 = 55, so total 4235. That's correct. So the input is 4235. So looking for an option where input is 4235. Only option A and F have inputs close to that. Option A's output is 3600, which is lower than our 3730. Option F's output is 3650, which is also lower. So perhaps the options have rounded numbers or different assumptions.

Wait, maybe the output is not exactly 3730. Did I get the HP to watts correct? Some sources say 1 HP is 745.7 watts, so 5 HP would be 5 * 745.7 = 3728.5 W, approximately 3730 W. So that part's correct.

So the correct input is 4235 W, output 3730 W, efficiency ≈88.1%. So looking at the options, the closest would be option B, which has efficiency 88.9%, but input is higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe the efficiency is calculated differently. Let me compute 3730 divided by 4235 again. 3730 ÷ 4235. Let me compute it more accurately.

3730 ÷ 4235: Let's see, 4235 × 0.88 = 4235 × 0.8 = 3388; 4235 ×0.08=338.8. So 3388 + 338.8 = 3726.8. That's close to 3730. So 0.88 gives 3726.8, which is very close to 3730. So the efficiency is approximately 88.07%, which rounds to about 88.1%. So the closest option would be option B at 88.9%, but that's higher. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing a step.

Wait, perhaps the question is looking for the machine's nameplate input, which is given as 110V and 38.5A, so input is 4235W. The output is 5HP, which is 3730W. So the efficiency is 3730/4235 ≈88.1%. But none of the options directly match this. Let me check all options again:

Option C: Input 4350, Output 3730. Efficiency would be 3730/4350 = 0.857, 85.7%. Not matching.

Option I: Input 4385, Output 3750. 3750/4385 ≈0.855, 85.5%.

Option F: Input 4230, Output 3650. 3650/4230 ≈0.863, 86.3%.

Option E: Input 4200, Output 3900. 3900/4200=0.9286, 92.86%, which seems high for a motor.

Option B: 4500 input, 4000 output. 4000/4500=0.8889, 88.9%.

Wait, but our input is 4235, not 4500. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but the closest would be option C, but that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the input calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the machine is a motor or generator. Typically, motors have some losses, so the output is less than input. Wait, no, the input is electrical, and output is mechanical. So the efficiency is output/input.

Wait, perhaps the options have rounded the numbers. Let me check option C again: Input 4350, Output 3730. So 3730/4350 = 0.857, which is 85.7%. That's not matching our 88.1%. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different conversion factor for horsepower. Some sources use 746 W per HP, others use 745.7. 5 HP would be 5 * 746 = 3730 W, or 5 * 745.7 = 3728.5 W. So that's correct.

I'm a bit confused because none of the options exactly match. But perhaps the correct answer is option C, but that doesn't align with the input. Wait, option C has input 4350, which is higher than our calculated 4235. That's a discrepancy. Maybe I made a mistake in the input calculation. Let me recalculate 110 * 38.5.

110 * 38.5: 110 * 38 is 4180, and 110 * 0.5 is 55. So 4180 +55=4235. That's correct. So the input is definitely 4235 W.

Looking back at the options, option A has input 4235 W, output 3600 W, which would give 3600/4235≈85% efficiency. But our output is 3730, so that's not matching. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but the closest would be option C if I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It says "at full load." So perhaps the output is not exactly 5 HP, but the machine's nameplate is 5 HP, and at full load, the output is 5 HP. So the input is 4235, output 3730, efficiency 88.1%. But none of the options match this exactly. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing a step.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the power factor. Oh right! Motors have a power factor, which affects the actual power input. The nameplate gives current as 38.5A, but without the power factor, the actual input is V * I * power factor. Wait, but the problem doesn't provide the power factor. So perhaps the question assumes the power factor is 1, which is not realistic, but maybe that's what they're expecting.

If that's the case, then the input is 110 * 38.5 = 4235 W, output 3730 W, efficiency 88.1%. But again, no option matches exactly. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different formula. Let me think: Input power is V * I = 110 * 38.5 =4235 W. Output is 5 HP =3730 W. So efficiency is 3730 /4235 ≈88.1%. So looking at the options, the closest is option B, which has efficiency 88.9%, but input is higher. Alternatively, perhaps the options have rounded the numbers, and option C is the intended answer.

Wait, perhaps I should check for any typos in the options. Let me look again:

Option C: Input 4350, Output 3730, Efficiency 85.7%.

Wait, 3730 /4350 is indeed 85.7%. So that's not matching our 88.1%. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but the closest would be none of the options. But since I have to choose from the given options, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different approach. Let me think again: Input is V * I = 110 *38.5=4235 W. Output is 5 HP=3730 W. Efficiency=3730/4235= ~88.1%. So the correct answer should have Input 4235, Output 3730, Efficiency ~88.1%. Looking at the options, none have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the output is not exactly 5 HP. Maybe the machine's output is 5 HP, but the input is higher. Wait, no, the nameplate gives the input as 110V and 38.5A. So the input is fixed. So the efficiency is fixed as well.

I'm a bit stuck here because none of the options match exactly. But perhaps the intended answer is option C, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check once more.

Input: 110 *38.5=4235 W.

Output:5 HP=3730 W.

Efficiency:3730/4235=0.881, 88.1%.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B: 4500 input, 4000 output, 88.9% efficiency. But that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer to be option C, but I'm not sure why.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the output is not exactly 5 HP. Maybe the machine's nameplate is 5 HP, but the actual output is less due to losses. Wait, no, the nameplate output is 5 HP, so the output is 3730 W. So the input is 4235 W, and efficiency is 88.1%. So the correct answer isn't listed, but perhaps the intended answer is option C, which has Output 3730 W, but higher input. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different formula for efficiency. Let me think: Efficiency = (Output / Input) *100. So that's correct. I think I've done everything right. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe option I is correct. Let me check option I: Input 4385, Output 3750. 3750/4385≈85.5%. No, that's lower than our 88.1%.

Wait, perhaps the question is expecting us to calculate the output as 5 HP, which is 3730 W, and input as 110*38.5=4235 W, leading to efficiency 88.1%. Since none of the options match exactly, perhaps there's a mistake in the options. But since I have to choose, maybe option C is the closest, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not sure why.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the output is in horsepower, and I'm supposed to calculate the input and efficiency differently. No, the output is given as 5 HP, which I converted to watts correctly. So I think the correct answer is not listed, but the closest would be none of the options. But since I have to choose, perhaps the intended answer is option C, but I'm not confident.

The problem involves calculating the input, output, and efficiency of a machine based on its nameplate ratings. The machine is rated at 110 volts, 38.5 amperes, and 5 horsepower. The input power is calculated as \( P = V \times I = 110 \, \text{V} \times 38.5 \, \text{A} = 4235 \, \text{W} \). The output power is derived from converting 5 horsepower to watts, which is \( 5 \times 746 = 3730 \, \text{W} \). The efficiency is then calculated as \( \frac{\text{Output}}{\text{Input}} \times 100 = \frac{3730}{4235} \times 100 \approx 88.1\% \).

However, none of the provided options exactly match these values. The closest option is **C**, which has an input of 4350 W, output of 3730 W, and efficiency of 85.7%. While this does not perfectly align with the calculations, it is the nearest match among the given choices.
