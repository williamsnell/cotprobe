Question:

 A ball is thrown eastward into the air from the origin (in the direction of the positive $x$-axis). The initial velocity is $50 \mathrm{i}+80 \mathrm{k}$, with speed measured in feet per second. The spin of the ball results in a southward acceleration of $4 \mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{s}^2$, so the acceleration vector is $\mathbf{a}=-4 \mathbf{j}-32 \mathbf{k}$. What speed does the ball land?

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a ball being thrown eastward with some initial velocity and acceleration, and I need to find its speed when it lands. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says the ball is thrown eastward, which I'm assuming is along the positive x-axis. The initial velocity is given as 50i + 80k ft/s. So, the initial velocity vector is (50, 0, 80). That makes sense because east is x and up is z, I think. Wait, sometimes they use y as vertical, but here it's k, so maybe z is up. Hmm, not sure, but the key is the components. The initial velocity has no j component, so the initial vertical (maybe z) component is 80 ft/s, and east (x) component is 50 ft/s.

Next, the spin causes a southward acceleration of 4 ft/s². So, south is the negative y direction. Wait, but the acceleration vector is given as a = -4j -32k. Oh, so the j component is negative, which would be south. So, the acceleration has two components: -4j (south) and -32k. The -32k probably is the gravitational acceleration downward, since gravity is about 32 ft/s². So, that makes sense.

Now, I need to find the speed when the ball lands. Speed is the magnitude of the velocity vector when it hits the ground. So, I think I'll need to find the velocity components in x, y, and z when it lands and then compute the magnitude.

But wait, how do I find when it lands? I think that's when the ball returns to the same vertical position, so y (or z?) position is zero. Wait, the initial position is at the origin (0,0,0), I assume. So, when the ball lands, its z-coordinate (if that's the vertical) would be zero again. Alternatively, if y is vertical, then when it lands, y would be zero. But in the acceleration vector, the vertical component is -32k, so maybe k is vertical. Hmm, perhaps I should clarify the axes. Let me think: in standard physics, y is usually vertical, but in this problem, the initial velocity is given in i and k. So, perhaps i is east (x), j is north-south (y), and k is up (z). That way, the initial velocity is east and up, and the acceleration has a south component (so negative y) and down (negative z).

Wait, but in the acceleration vector, it's -4j -32k. So, j is positive y as north, so negative j is south. And k is positive upwards, so negative k is downward. So, the acceleration is southward (so y component is -4) and downward, due to gravity, which is -32k.

So, the position as a function of time can be found by integrating the acceleration, then velocity, then position.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Find the velocity as a function of time by integrating the acceleration.
2. Find the position as a function of time by integrating the velocity.
3. Determine the time when the ball lands, which is when the vertical component (z) returns to zero.
4. Use that time to find the velocity components at that time.
5. Compute the magnitude of the velocity vector.

Wait, but wait. The initial velocity is given as 50i + 80k, so initial velocity in x and z. The acceleration is -4j -32k, so the acceleration is in y and z. So, the x-component of velocity remains constant, since there's no acceleration in x. The y-component starts at zero and changes due to acceleration in y. The z-component starts at 80 and changes due to acceleration in z.

So, let's write the velocity components as functions of time.

Velocity in x: v_x = 50 + 0*t = 50 ft/s (constant).

Velocity in y: v_y = 0 + (-4)*t = -4t ft/s.

Velocity in z: v_z = 80 + (-32)*t = 80 - 32t ft/s.

Because acceleration in x is zero, so v_x remains 50. For y, initial is zero, so v_y = a_y * t = (-4)t. For z, initial is 80, and acceleration is -32, so v_z = 80 -32t.

Next, position as function of time. Since initial position is (0,0,0), integrating velocity gives position.

Position x: s_x = 50*t + 0 = 50t.

Position y: s_y = 0 + 0*t + (1/2)*a_y * t² = 0.5*(-4)*t² = -2t². Wait, but negative y is south, so the ball is moving south as time progresses, which makes sense because of the spin.

Position z: s_z = 80t + 0.5*a_z * t² = 80t + 0.5*(-32)*t² = 80t -16t².

Now, the ball lands when it returns to the ground, which I think is when s_z = 0, because it started from the origin. So, solving for t when s_z = 0.

So, 80t -16t² = 0.

Factor out t: t*(80 -16t) = 0.

Solutions are t=0 (launch time) and t=80/16 = 5 seconds. So, the ball lands at t=5 seconds.

Now, find the velocity components at t=5.

v_x = 50 ft/s (constant).

v_y = -4*5 = -20 ft/s.

v_z = 80 -32*5 = 80 -160 = -80 ft/s.

So, the velocity vector at landing is (50, -20, -80).

Wait, but that's the velocity vector. The speed is the magnitude of this vector. So, speed = sqrt(50² + (-20)^2 + (-80)^2).

Calculating each component:

50^2 = 2500.

(-20)^2 = 400.

(-80)^2 = 6400.

Sum: 2500 + 400 = 2900 + 6400 = 9300.

So sqrt(9300) = sqrt(100*93) = 10*sqrt(93).

Wait, but looking at the options, option I is 10√93 ft/s. So, that's one of the choices. So the answer should be I.

Wait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, when I calculated v_z at t=5, 32*5 is 160, so 80 -160 is -80. Correct.

v_y is -4*5 = -20. Correct.

v_x is 50, correct.

Then, the components squared:

50^2 = 2500.

20^2 = 400. So, 2500 + 400 = 2900.

80^2 = 6400. 2900 + 6400 = 9300.

Square root of 9300 is sqrt(93 * 100) = 10*sqrt(93). So, yes, that's correct.

Looking at the options, option I is 10√93 ft/s, so that's the answer.
</think>

The ball's speed when it lands is calculated by finding the magnitude of its velocity vector at the time it returns to the ground. The velocity components are determined using the acceleration and initial velocity. The speed is found to be $10\sqrt{93} \, \mathrm{ft}/\mathrm{s}$, which corresponds to option I.
