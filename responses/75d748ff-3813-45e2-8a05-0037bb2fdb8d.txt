Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question about national income accounts. The question is about an American buying an entertainment system made in China. I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that when a country's residents buy goods and services produced abroad, it affects their national income accounts. The U.S. buys something from China, so how does that show up in their GDP?

Wait, GDP is the total output produced within a country's borders. So if the entertainment system is made in China, it's not part of the U.S. GDP. So the U.S. GDP doesn't increase because of this purchase. That much I think I get.

But what about net exports? Net exports are exports minus imports. If the U.S. is importing this entertainment system, that's an increase in imports. So net exports would decrease because imports go up, right? Because net exports = exports - imports, so if imports rise, net exports fall.

Looking at the options, I need to see which one matches this scenario. The key points are: U.S. GDP doesn't change because the product was made in China. Net exports decrease because it's an import.

So the options are A through J. Let's see:

Option A: Net exports and GDP both fall. Well, GDP doesn't fall because the product wasn't produced in the U.S. So A is incorrect.

Option B: GDP falls and net exports no change. No, GDP doesn't fall; it's unchanged. So B is wrong.

Option C: Net exports rise and GDP no change. No, because imports rising would lower net exports, not raise. So C is wrong.

Option D: Both rise. No, GDP doesn't rise, and net exports don't either. So D is out.

Option E: Net exports rise and GDP falls. No, because net exports don't rise; they fall, and GDP doesn't fall. So E is wrong.

Option F: No change in either. But net exports do change because imports increased. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Net exports and GDP go opposite. Hmm, net exports fall, GDP stays same. So they go in opposite directions? Wait, GDP didn't change, so it's not really opposite, but maybe. Not sure yet.

Option H: Net exports fall and GDP rises. No, GDP doesn't rise because the product wasn't made in the U.S. So H is wrong.

Option I: GDP rises and net exports no change. No, GDP doesn't rise, so I is out.

Option J: Net exports fall and GDP no change. Yes, that seems to fit. Because the purchase increases imports, so net exports (exports - imports) fall, and GDP remains the same because the product wasn't produced in the U.S.

Wait, let me think again. When the American buys a product made in China, it's an import. So in the U.S. national accounts, this is recorded as an increase in imports. Imports are subtracted in net exports (exports minus imports). So net exports decrease because imports went up. But the GDP doesn't change because the product wasn't produced in the U.S. So yes, net exports fall, and GDP remains the same. So the correct option is J.

The American purchase of a Chinese-made entertainment system affects the U.S. national income accounts by increasing imports, thereby decreasing net exports, while GDP remains unchanged as the product was not produced in the U.S.

Answer: J
