C: hLh
D: Lfh
E: LfLh
F: fLhL
G: fLf
H: hLfL
I: fLh

Alright, let's tackle this logic problem. So, the question is to translate "Holly loves Frances" into predicate logic. The given options are A through J, each with a different arrangement of symbols.

First, I need to understand the components. The statement involves two people: Holly and Frances. The predicate is "loves," which is a binary relation because it involves two entities (x loves y). 

Looking at the variables, the user provided f for Frances and h for Holly. The predicate Lxy represents "x loves y." So, Lxy would mean x (the first variable) loves y (the second variable).

The sentence "Holly loves Frances" translates to Holly is the subject (x) and Frances is the object (y). So substituting, x is h (Holly) and y is f (Frances). Therefore, the predicate should be Lhf, which is L followed by h and f.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A is Lhf. That matches exactly what I'm thinking. So that's a candidate.

Option B is hLf. Wait, that's h followed by L and f, which would mean Frances loves Holly, right? Because L is a binary predicate, so the order matters. So B would be Frances loves Holly, which is the opposite of what we need.

Option C is hLh. That would mean Holly loves Holly, which isn't the case here.

Option D is Lfh. That would be Frances loves Holly, again the opposite.

Option E is LfLh. Hmm, that looks more complicated. It seems like Lf (Frances loves) followed by Lh, but that doesn't make sense in this context because the sentence is a single statement, not a compound one.

Option F is fLhL. That's Frances loves Holly loves? That doesn't make sense grammatically. Maybe it's trying to say something else, but I don't think so.

Option G is fLf. That would be Frances loves herself, which isn't the case.

Option H is hLfL. This seems to have extra letters, possibly indicating multiple predicates, but the original statement is straightforward.

Option I is fLh. Wait, fLh would mean Frances loves Holly, which is again the opposite.

Option J is LfhL. That seems to have an extra L at the end, which doesn't fit.

So, the correct translation should be Lhf, which is option A. All other options either reverse the order or add unnecessary elements.

The correct translation of "Holly loves Frances" into predicate logic is Lhf, which corresponds to option A.
