Question:

Statement 1| Overfitting is more likely when the set of training data is small. Statement 2| Overfitting is more likely when the hypothesis space is small.

Options:

A: False, False, False
B: True, True
C: False, False

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the two statements about overfitting are true or false. Let me start by recalling what overfitting means. From what I remember, overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing the noise and details, which makes it perform poorly on new, unseen data. So, the model is too complex or has too much flexibility, right?

Looking at Statement 1: "Overfitting is more likely when the set of training data is small." Hmm, I think this is correct. If you have a small training dataset, the model might learn all the patterns, including the noise, because there's not enough data to generalize. For example, if you have very few examples, the model can memorize them instead of learning the underlying concept. So, a smaller training set increases the risk of overfitting. So Statement 1 is True.

Now, Statement 2: "Overfitting is more likely when the hypothesis space is small." Wait, the hypothesis space refers to the set of all possible models the algorithm can choose from. If the hypothesis space is small, that means the models are limited in complexity. For example, using a linear model when the actual data is non-linear. In this case, the model might underfit because it can't capture the complexity of the data. Underfitting is when the model is too simple and can't learn the data well, not when it's overfitting. So, a small hypothesis space would make underfitting more likely, not overfitting. Therefore, Statement 2 is False.

So, putting it together: Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is False. Now, looking at the options, I need to find which option corresponds to True, False. Let me check the options:

Option F: True, False. That must be the correct choice.

The first statement is true because a small training set increases overfitting risk. The second statement is false because a small hypothesis space leads to underfitting, not overfitting. 

Answer: F
