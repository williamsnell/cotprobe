Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this question about the difference between discrete and continuous motor tasks and which is easier to remember after an interval of time. The question gives me options from A to J, and I have to choose the correct one.

First, I'll try to understand what discrete and continuous motor tasks are. From what I remember, motor tasks can be categorized into two main types: discrete and continuous. Discrete tasks involve a sequence of separate movements, like throwing a ball or typing a specific message. Each movement is distinct and has a clear beginning and end. On the other hand, continuous motor tasks involve ongoing, uninterrupted movements, such as running, cycling, or maintaining posture. These tasks don't have clear start and end points and are more about sustaining an action over time.

Now, the question is about which type is easier to remember after some time has passed. So, I'm thinking about how memory works for these kinds of tasks. Discrete tasks have a specific sequence, so once you learn them, they might be easier to remember because each step is separate and can be recalled individually. For example, if you learn a dance routine with specific steps, you can break it down and remember each part. Continuous tasks, like riding a bike, might be more about muscle memory and习惯, which are more automatic but perhaps harder to consciously recall because they don't have distinct steps.

Wait, no, actually, when you think about it, continuous tasks might be more ingrained in procedural memory, which is more automatic and thus might be remembered more easily because they're repeated consistently. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe discrete tasks, being more about a sequence, could be harder to remember because each step needs to be in order, and if you don't use them for a while, you might forget some parts. Continuous tasks, on the other hand, might be more about the overall movement pattern, which could be easier to pick up again because you don't have to remember each individual step in sequence.

Looking at the options, I need to see which one aligns with this reasoning. Let's go through them:

Option A: Discrete skills are more difficult to remember due to their complexity. This seems plausible because discrete tasks have a sequence and might be more complex, making them harder to remember. But wait, complexity isn't the only factor; sometimes, structure can aid memory.

Option B: Continuous skills require more cognitive effort to recall. I'm not sure. If continuous tasks are more automatic, maybe they don't require as much cognitive effort when recalling.

Option C: Neither are easy to remember. That might be too general; the question seems to suggest there's a difference.

Option D: Continuous skills are not easily forgotten. This could be true because they're more habitual, making them harder to forget.

Option E: Continuous skills are easier to remember because they are always performed in a consistent environment. Hmm, the environment could play a role, but I'm not sure this is the main reason. Memory also depends on the nature of the task itself, not just the environment.

Option F: Continuous skills are more difficult to remember because they are less repetitive. Wait, continuous tasks are actually more repetitive, so this might not be correct.

Option G: Both are equally easy to remember. I don't think that's the case; the nature of the tasks likely affects their memorability differently.

Option H: Discrete skills become more precise over time. This is about precision, not memory, so probably not the answer.

Option I: Discrete skills are easier to remember because they involve a sequence of movements. This seems to fit because each step is a distinct memory point, so you can remember each part, making the whole task easier to recall.

Option J: Discrete skills are not easily forgotten. Again, this is about forgetting, not remembering after an interval.

So, considering all this, I think the correct answer is either A or I. However, the question is about which is easier to remember after an interval. Discrete tasks, with their sequence, might be easier to remember because you can break them down, whereas continuous tasks might be harder because they're more about maintaining a flow without distinct steps. Therefore, option I says discrete skills are easier because they involve a sequence, which aligns with that reasoning. Alternatively, option A says discrete are harder due to complexity, but I think the structure of discrete tasks actually aids memory, making them easier to remember.

Wait, but sometimes the opposite might be true. Continuous tasks are more about automaticity, which is easier to remember because they're done more frequently, so maybe they're easier to recall. But the question is about after an interval. If you don't use them regularly, maybe the continuous tasks fade faster because they rely on repetition. Discrete tasks, being more structured, might be remembered better because they can be practiced in chunks.

Alternatively, I might be getting this mixed up. Let me think again. Discrete tasks are like learning a specific skill, like a dance step, which you can break down. Once you learn it, you can remember each part, so after some time, you can reconstruct the steps. Continuous tasks, like riding a bike, are more about maintaining balance and movement, which are more automatic. But if you don't practice, even these might be forgotten. So perhaps discrete tasks are easier to remember because they're more structured and can be practiced in segments, whereas continuous tasks might be harder to recall because they lack clear segments and are more about sustained effort.

So, looking back at the options, option I says discrete skills are easier to remember because they involve a sequence of movements. That makes sense. Alternatively, option D says continuous skills are not easily forgotten, which might be true because they're more habitual, but the question is about which is easier to remember after an interval, implying that one is easier than the other.

I think the correct answer is I: Discrete skills are easier to remember because they involve a sequence of movements.

The question asks about the difference between discrete and continuous motor tasks and which is easier to remember after an interval of time. Discrete tasks involve distinct, sequential movements, making them easier to break down and remember because each step can be recalled individually. Continuous tasks, on the other hand, involve sustained, automatic movements that may be harder to remember after an interval due to their lack of distinct steps. Therefore, discrete skills are easier to remember because they involve a sequence of movements.

Answer: I
