<think>
Okay, so I've got this question about ophthalmic prescriptions and contact lenses. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I remember that when people wear glasses, the lenses are placed a certain distance in front of the cornea, and contact lenses are worn directly on the eye. The question is asking how the prescription would change if someone switches from glasses to contacts.

The original prescription is -4.50 m⁻¹, and the glasses are worn 14mm in front of the cornea. I think the key here is that contact lenses are in contact with the eye, so the lens is much closer to the cornea compared to glasses. I've heard that the power of the lens can change based on the distance from the eye because the optical power (which is measured in diopters, or m⁻¹) depends on the refractive index and the shape of the lens, but also on the distance from the eye's surface.

Wait, I think there's a formula related to the conversion between spectacle lenses and contact lenses. Oh right, there's the "lens power conversion formula." I remember that the power of the contact lens (Pc) is related to the power of the spectacle lens (Ps) and the distance between them. The formula is something like Pc = Ps + (1 / d), where d is the distance in meters. But wait, I might be mixing things up. No, wait, I think it's actually that the contact lens power is equal to the spectacle power plus the change in power due to the distance. Oh but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

No, I think the correct formula is that when moving from a distance d in front of the cornea to the contact lens (which is at d=0), the power changes. The formula involves the distance in meters. So the distance here is 14mm, which is 0.014 meters. The formula I think is: the power of the contact lens (Pc) is equal to the power of the spectacle lens (Ps) plus the power change due to the distance. But wait, the spectacle lens is placed d meters in front, so the contact lens would have a different power because the same focal length would be adjusted based on where the lens is placed.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me try to recall. The formula for the conversion from spectacle (distance d in front) to contact lens is: P_contact = P_spectacle + (1 / d). But wait, no, that doesn't make sense dimensionally. Because if d is in meters, 1/d is in diopters, so adding that to the spectacle power would change the total. But wait, I think the correct relationship is that the contact lens power is equal to the spectacle power plus the reciprocal of the distance. Or is it the other way around? Let me think.

Alternatively, I remember that the contact lens power is higher than the spectacle power because the lens is closer to the eye. So if you're moving the lens closer, the power increases. Because the same focal length when closer would have a higher diopter value.

Wait, let me think of it in terms of focal length. The spectacle lens has a focal length f_s, and the contact lens f_c. Since the contact lens is placed closer to the eye, the focal length would be shorter, making the power higher.

The relationship between the two might involve the distance d between the two lenses. So, the formula I think is: (1/f_c) = (1/f_s) + (1/d). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the total power at the eye when using glasses is the same as when using contacts, but the position changes, so the power of the contact lens must account for the difference in position.

Wait, another approach: the spectacle lens is placed d in front of the cornea. The contact lens is placed at the cornea. So the total power experienced by the eye would be the sum of the spectacle power and the contact power, considering the distance. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I think the formula is: when moving a lens from a distance d in front of the eye to being in contact (d=0), the power changes because the effective focal length changes. The formula is P_contact = P_spectacle + (1/d). But wait, if d is in meters, then 1/d is in diopters. Let me test this.

In this case, P_contact = -4.50 m⁻¹ + (1 / 0.014 m). Wait, 1/0.014 is approximately 71.43 diopters. Adding that to -4.50 would give a huge positive number, which doesn't make sense because the original prescription is negative. So that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe I got the formula wrong. Perhaps it's the other way around: the contact lens power is less than the spectacle power because when you bring the lens closer, the effect is stronger, so you need a weaker lens? Or maybe it's about the optical path.

Wait, I think I'm confusing addition and subtraction. Let me think again. The spectacle lens is placed at a certain distance. The contact lens is at the eye's surface. The formula I found in some notes before was that P_contact = P_spectacle + (1/d), but I might have to check the sign.

Wait, no, another approach: When you move a lens closer, its power increases. So, if a lens is placed d meters in front of the cornea, and then moved to 0, the power increases. So the contact lens would have a higher power than the spectacle lens.

Wait, but the original power is -4.50. So the contact lens would be more negative? Or more positive?

Wait, no, my mistake. For a myope (nearsighted person), the corrective lens is a diverging lens (negative power). If you bring the lens closer, the divergence would be more effective, so perhaps the power needs to be stronger (more negative). But wait, in reality, contact lenses for myopes are usually the same power as the spectacle correction because they are placed at the cornea's surface, so the same effect as the eye's own optics.

Wait, but wait, the question is about how the power changes when moving from 14mm in front to the cornea. So the contact lens would have a different power. Let me think of it in terms of the lens formula.

The formula for the effective power when a lens is placed at a distance d in front of the eye is given by P_total = P_lens + (1/d). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because if d is the distance, then 1/d is in diopters. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the effective power when a lens is placed at a distance d is P = P_lens + (1/f), where f is the focal length due to the distance. Hmm, I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps the formula is P_contact = P_spectacle + (1/d), but with d in meters. So P_contact = -4.50 + (1/0.014). Let me compute that.

1/0.014 = approx 71.43 diopters. So -4.50 + 71.43 = 66.93, which is way too high. That can't be right because the options don't go anywhere near that. So maybe I'm using the wrong formula.

Alternatively, perhaps it's P_contact = P_spectacle - (1/d). Let me try that.

-4.50 - 71.43 ≈ -75.93, which is even worse. No, that's not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. I think the correct formula is that when moving from a lens placed at a distance d to a contact lens (d=0), the power changes by 1/d. So the contact lens power is P_contact = P_spectacle + (1/d). But that leads to a very high positive number, which isn't in the options. So maybe I'm missing a sign.

Wait, maybe the formula is P_contact = P_spectacle - (1/d). Let me try that again.

-4.50 - (1/0.014) = -4.50 - 71.43 ≈ -75.93, which is way off.

Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the formula. Maybe the correct formula is P_contact = P_spectacle - (1/d). But that gives a very negative number, which isn't the case here.

Wait, another approach: The power of a lens in air is P. When placed at a distance d in front of the eye, the effective power changes because the eye's optics now include the distance. So perhaps the formula is P_contact = P_spectacle + (1/d), but considering that the eye's own optics might play a role. Alternatively, maybe it's P_contact = P_spectacle - (1/d).

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formula. Let me look for a different approach. The question is about converting a spectacle prescription to contact lenses. I think that when moving from a distance d in front to the cornea (d=0), the contact lens power can be calculated using the formula: P_contact = P_spectacle + (1/d), but considering the sign.

Wait, but that would make the contact lens power much stronger, which isn't matching the options. So maybe the correct approach is that the contact lens needs to account for the fact that the lens is now closer, so the power would be higher (more negative in this case, as it's myopia).

Wait, let me think about the optical path. The spectacle lens is placed 14mm in front, so the contact lens is 14mm closer to the eye. The power of the contact lens must compensate for that distance. So the contact lens power would be higher in magnitude than the spectacle lens.

Wait, I think the formula is that the contact lens power is the spectacle power plus the reciprocal of the distance in meters. So P_contact = P_spectacle + (1/d). Let me compute that.

1/0.014 = approx 71.43 diopters. So adding that to -4.50 gives 66.93, which is way too high. That can't be right because none of the options are near that.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Maybe the formula is P_contact = P_spectacle - (1/d). Let me try that.

-4.50 -71.43 ≈ -75.93, which is even worse.

Hmm, something's wrong here. Maybe the formula is different. I think I remember that when converting from a distance to contact, the contact lens power is P_contact = P_spectacle + (1/d). But that seems to give a huge number. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is P_contact = P_spectacle * (1 + (d/1)), but that doesn't make sense dimensionally.

Wait, another approach: The power of the lens is inversely proportional to the focal length. If the lens is moved closer, the focal length changes, so the power changes. Let's say the spectacle lens has a focal length f_s, and the contact lens has f_c. The relationship might be that the difference in focal lengths is related to the distance d.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for an example. Suppose the spectacle prescription is -4.50 D and it's placed 14mm (0.014m) in front. The contact lens would need to have a power that accounts for this distance. I think the formula is P_contact = P_spectacle + (1/d). So let's compute that again.

1/0.014 ≈71.43 D. So -4.50 +71.43 ≈66.93 D. That's way higher than any option, so I must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula is P_contact = P_spectacle - (1/d). Let me compute that. -4.50 -71.43 ≈-75.93, which is not an option either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the formula backwards. Maybe when moving the lens closer, the power actually decreases. Wait, that doesn't make sense because bringing a diverging lens closer would make it diverge more, requiring a stronger (more negative) lens.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The spectacle lens is placed 14mm in front, so the contact lens is 14mm closer. So the same correction would require a stronger lens when placed closer, right? Because the effect is stronger when the lens is closer.

So if the original is -4.50, the contact lens would need to be more negative, i.e., lower power (since higher negative is stronger). But looking at the options, the options are all less negative than -4.50 except B and C. Wait, the options are:

A: -4.23

B: -5.00

C: -4.75

D: -4.10

E: -4.50

F: -3.90

G: -4.60

H: -3.75

I: -4.00

J: -3.80

So options B and C are more negative than -4.50. So perhaps the contact lens would need a more negative power, which would be option B (-5.00) or C (-4.75).

But wait, earlier calculations suggested a much higher number, which doesn't fit. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is P_contact = P_spectacle - (1/d). Let me compute that again.

-4.50 - (1/0.014) ≈-4.50 -71.43 ≈-75.93 D, which is way too low.

No, that can't be right. Maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Let me look for another approach.

I think the correct formula is that the contact lens power is the spectacle power plus the reciprocal of the distance. So P_contact = P_spectacle + (1/d).

But that gives a very high positive number, which doesn't make sense for a myope. So perhaps I'm missing a negative sign. Maybe the formula is P_contact = P_spectacle - (1/d).

Wait, but that gives a more negative number. Let me compute that again.

-4.50 -71.43 ≈-75.93 D, which is way beyond the options. So I must be doing something wrong.

Wait, perhaps the distance is measured in the opposite direction. Maybe it's 1/d subtracted. Or perhaps the formula is P_contact = P_spectacle + (1/d), but d is in the opposite sign.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck because I can't remember the exact formula. Maybe I should think about the problem differently. The contact lens is 14mm closer to the eye than the spectacle lens. So the effect of the lens is stronger, so the power needed would be less, because the same effect is achieved with a closer lens.

Wait, no. Wait, for myopia, you need a diverging lens. Bringing the lens closer would make the divergence more effective, so you need a weaker lens (less negative) because the same effect is achieved with the closer distance.

Wait, that makes sense. So if the spectacle lens is placed 14mm in front, and the contact lens is placed on the cornea, the contact lens is 14mm closer. So the effect of the contact lens is stronger, meaning you can have a weaker contact lens (less negative) to achieve the same correction.

So the contact lens power would be less negative than the spectacle lens. For example, if the spectacle is -4.50, the contact might be something like -4.23, which is option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought that moving the lens closer would require a stronger (more negative) lens, but now I'm thinking the opposite. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about it this way. The spectacle lens is placed 14mm in front, so the light first passes through the spectacle lens, then travels 14mm to reach the cornea. The contact lens is placed at the cornea. So the effective power of the spectacle lens plus the effect of the 14mm path would be the same as the contact lens.

So the formula would be: 1/f_contact = 1/f_spectacle + (1/d), where d is the distance in meters. Because the light travels through the spectacle lens and then through the air for distance d, which acts like a thin lens with power 1/d.

Wait, that makes sense. So the effective power of the contact lens would be the sum of the spectacle power and the power due to the distance.

So P_contact = P_spectacle + (1/d).

But wait, let me compute that again.

P_spectacle = -4.50 D

d = 0.014 m

1/d = approx 71.43 D

So P_contact = -4.50 + 71.43 ≈66.93 D, which is way too high. That can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps the formula is the other way around. Maybe the contact lens is placed at the cornea, so the effective power of the spectacle lens plus the contact lens must account for the distance. Wait, I'm getting more confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is P_contact = P_spectacle - (1/d). So -4.50 -71.43 ≈-75.93, which is even worse.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about the focal length. The focal length of the spectacle lens is f_s = 1/P_s = 1/(-4.50) ≈-0.222 m. The contact lens has f_c = 1/P_c.

Now, when the spectacle lens is placed 14mm (0.014m) in front of the cornea, the contact lens is at the cornea. So the total focal length from the spectacle lens to the cornea is f_s + 0.014 m. Wait, no, that's not correct. The focal length calculation would involve the position of the focal point.

Wait, perhaps the formula is that the contact lens must correct for the same focal point as the spectacle lens plus the distance. So the focal point of the contact lens should be at the same position as the focal point of the spectacle lens plus the distance d.

Wait, if the spectacle lens has a focal length of f_s, then the contact lens would have a focal length f_c such that f_c = f_s + d. Because the light passes through the spectacle lens, then travels d meters, then reaches the cornea, where the contact lens focuses it.

But for myopia, the focal point is in front of the retina, so the spectacle lens moves it back to the retina. The contact lens, being at the cornea, would need to adjust for that.

Alternatively, the effective focal length of the contact lens would be f_c = f_s + d. So f_c = (-0.222 m) + 0.014 m ≈-0.208 m.

Then the power of the contact lens would be P_c = 1/f_c ≈1/(-0.208) ≈-4.807 m⁻¹.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C: -4.75. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f_c = f_s - d, because the contact lens is closer. So f_c = (-0.222) - 0.014 = -0.236 m. Then P_c = 1/-0.236 ≈-4.237 m⁻¹, which is approximately -4.23 D, option A.

Wait, that makes sense. Because moving the lens closer (d=0.014m) would require a weaker lens (less negative) because the same effect is achieved with the lens closer to the eye. So the contact lens would have a power of about -4.23 D, which is option A.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Another way to think: the contact lens is 14mm closer, so the effective power is P_contact = P_spectacle - (1/d). Wait, no, that would be -4.50 -71.43, which is too negative.

Wait, but in the earlier calculation where I used f_c = f_s - d, I got P_c ≈-4.23 D, which is option A. That seems plausible.

So the answer would be A: -4.23 m⁻¹.
</think>

When converting a spectacle lens prescription to a contact lens prescription, the distance between the lens and the cornea must be considered. The spectacle lens is placed 14 mm (0.014 m) in front of the cornea, while the contact lens is worn directly on the cornea. This change in position affects the effective power of the lens.

The formula to calculate the contact lens power is:

\[
P_{\text{contact}} = P_{\text{spectacle}} - \frac{1}{d}
\]

where \( P_{\text{spectacle}} \) is the spectacle lens power, and \( d \) is the distance in meters. Substituting the given values:

\[
P_{\text{contact}} = -4.50 \, \text{D} - \frac{1}{0.014 \, \text{m}} \approx -4.50 \, \text{D} - 71.43 \, \text{D} \approx -75.93 \, \text{D}
\]

This result is not physically meaningful for a contact lens prescription, indicating a potential misunderstanding of the formula. Instead, the correct approach involves considering the focal length relationship. The spectacle lens focal length is:

\[
f_{\text{spectacle}} = \frac{1}{P_{\text{spectacle}}} = \frac{1}{-4.50} \approx -0.222 \, \text{m}
\]

The contact lens focal length is adjusted for the 14 mm distance:

\[
f_{\text{contact}} = f_{\text{spectacle}} - d = -0.222 \, \text{m} - 0.014 \, \text{m} = -0.236 \, \text{m}
\]

The contact lens power is then:

\[
P_{\text{contact}} = \frac{1}{f_{\text{contact}}} = \frac{1}{-0.236} \approx -4.23 \, \text{D}
\]

Thus, the contact lens prescription is approximately **-4.23 m⁻¹**, which corresponds to option A.
