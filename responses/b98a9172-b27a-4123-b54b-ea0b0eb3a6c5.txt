Question:

An integer c is a common divisor of two integers x and y if and only if c is a divisor of x and c is a divisor of y. Which of the following sets of integers could possibly be the set of all common divisors of two integers?

Options:

A: {-10, -5, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 5, 10}
B: {-6, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 6}
C: {-6, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 6}
D: {-6, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 6}

Okay, so I have this question about common divisors of two integers. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question says that an integer c is a common divisor of two integers x and y if and only if c divides both x and y. So, I'm supposed to find which of the given sets could be the set of all common divisors of two integers.

Looking at the options, each one is a set of integers. The key thing I remember is that the common divisors of two integers are all the divisors of their greatest common divisor (GCD). So, if I can find the GCD of x and y, the set of all common divisors will be all the divisors of that GCD, including both positive and negative, and also zero? Wait, no, wait. Because zero can't be a divisor of any number. Oh wait, no, because zero divided by any number is undefined, so zero can't be in the set of common divisors. So, any set that includes zero can't be the set of common divisors. That's an important point.

So first, let me look through the options to see which ones include zero. Option A has 0, B has 0, D has 0, but C doesn't. So options A, B, D include zero, which can't be right. So perhaps only option C could be correct.

Wait, but let me make sure. Because the question says "the set of all common divisors of two integers." So the set must consist of all integers that divide both x and y. So zero can't be in that set because division by zero is undefined. So any set that includes zero is invalid. Therefore, options A, B, D are out because they all include zero. That leaves only option C as a possibility.

Wait, but let me check if option C makes sense. Option C is {-6, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 6}. So these are all the divisors of 6 and -6. So if x and y have a GCD of 6, then their common divisors would include all divisors of 6, which are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6. So that matches option C. So that's a possible set.

What about the other options? Let's see. Option A includes -10, -5, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 5, 10. But since it has 0, it's invalid. Option B has 0 too, so invalid. Option D has 0, so also invalid. So only option C doesn't include zero and has all the divisors of 6, which would be the common divisors if the GCD is 6.

Wait, but another thing: the common divisors of x and y include all the divisors of their GCD, both positive and negative. So for example, if x and y have a GCD of 6, then the common divisors are all the divisors of 6, which are indeed ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6. So option C is correct.

Let me make sure there's no trick here. The question says "could possibly be the set," so as long as there exist two integers x and y whose common divisors are exactly that set, it's acceptable. So for option C, yes, because if x and y are both multiples of 6, their GCD is 6, and thus their common divisors are exactly those in option C.

So the answer must be option C.

The correct answer is C because it includes all the divisors of 6, which would be the common divisors of two integers with a GCD of 6. Other options include zero, which is invalid for common divisors.
