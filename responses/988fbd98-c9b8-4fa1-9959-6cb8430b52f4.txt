Question:

A relevant fact in a plaintiff's suit is the magnitude of an explosion at an oil refinery one evening. At trial, the plaintiff was asked on direct examination if he remembered the explosion. He replied, "I recall my son running into the home and screaming that the car windows just shattered. " The son was available to testify at trial. The defendant's attorney makes a motion to strike the plaintiff's answer. The trial judge should rule the plaintiff's testimony

Options:

A: admissible, because the son is available as a witness.
B: admissible, if the son's testimony corroborates the plaintiff's statement.
C: inadmissible, because the statement can be considered secondhand information.
D: admissible, because it gives context to the magnitude of the explosion.
E: inadmissible under the excited utterance exception, because it can be a product of reflection and deliberation.
F: admissible, because it provides relevant details about the incident.
G: admissible, whether or not the son is available as a witness.
H: inadmissible, because the plaintiff's statement is based on the son's account.
I: inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.
J: inadmissible, unless the son's account is presented as evidence.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the plaintiff's testimony about his son's scream is admissible. Let me break this down.

The question is about evidence law, specifically hearsay exceptions. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. But there are exceptions where hearsay is allowed.

In this case, the plaintiff was asked if he remembered the explosion. He says his son ran in and screamed that the car windows shattered. The son is available to testify, so the defendant's attorney wants this testimony struck.

I remember that the excited utterance exception (FRE 803(2)) allows for statements made under the stress of a startling event, where the declarant is still under the stress. These statements are admissible because they're believed to be true and made without time for reflection.

Here, the son's scream about shattered windows happened right after the explosion. That's a startling event. The son was still under the stress of the explosion when he spoke, so his statement would qualify as an excited utterance.

But wait, the plaintiff is testifying about what the son said. Is that hearsay? Yes, because it's an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth that the windows shattered. So normally, it would be inadmissible unless it falls under an exception.

But the son is available. If the son is available, the statement might not be admissible under the exception because the rule prefers to have the declarant testify if possible. I think the availability of the declarant affects whether the exception applies. If the declarant is available, the excited utterance might not be allowed because the statement can be corroborated or the witness can be cross-examined.

Wait, no, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The excited utterance exception doesn't require the declarant to be unavailable. It just requires that the statement was made under stress. So even if the son is available, the statement could still be admissible as an excited utterance.

Wait, but another point: the statement is being offered by the plaintiff. The plaintiff is recounting something the son said. But the plaintiff's own perceptionâ€”did he see the windows shattered? Or is he relaying the son's words? If the statement is being offered to show that the windows did shatter, then it's hearsay.

But under the excited utterance exception, if the son's statement was made while under stress, it's admissible. So the fact that the son is available might not matter because the exception doesn't require unavailability. So the statement would be admissible as an excited utterance, making the answer D or F?

Wait, looking at the options:

Option D says admissible because it gives context to the magnitude of the explosion. Hmm, context might be a reason, but the main reason is the excited utterance exception.

Option F says admissible because it provides relevant details. Also relevant, but perhaps the better reason is the exception.

Option I says inadmissible as hearsay not within any exception. But since the excited utterance might apply, I is incorrect.

Option E says inadmissible under excited utterance because it could be reflective. Wait, excited utterances are allowed if made under stress and before the declarant had time to fabricate. But if there's time between the event and the statement, it might not qualify. But in this case, the son ran in right after the explosion and screamed. So it's immediate.

So the statement is admissible under the excited utterance exception. Therefore, the motion to strike should be denied, meaning the testimony is admissible.

Wait, but the son is available, so does that affect it? I think the availability of the declarant doesn't negate the exception. The exception applies regardless of availability; it's just that the declarant's presence allows for more thorough examination, but doesn't make the statement inadmissible.

So looking at the options, the correct reasoning would be that the statement is admissible under the excited utterance exception, which makes the testimony admissible. So the judge should not strike it.

Looking back at the options, option D says admissible because it gives context to the magnitude. That's a possible reason, but the primary reason is the exception. Alternatively, option F says relevant details, which is also true. However, the key here is the hearsay exception.

Wait, but the options may not directly state the exception. Let's check each option again.

Option A: Admissible because the son is available. Hmm, that's not the reason. It's about the exception, not availability.

Option B: Admissible if the son's testimony corroborates. That's not the standard; the exception doesn't require corroboration.

Option C: Inadmissible as secondhand. That's not accurate because the exception applies.

Option D: Admissible because it gives context. That's a possible reason but not the main one.

Option E: Inadmissible under excited utterance because it could be reflective. No, the opposite is true; it's admissible if made under stress.

Option F: Admissible because provides relevant details. True, but not the main legal reason.

Option G: Admissible whether the son is available. That's correct because the exception doesn't require unavailability.

Wait, but the motion is to strike the plaintiff's answer. The judge should allow it if it's an excited utterance. So the correct answer would be that the testimony is admissible under the exception, regardless of the son's availability.

So looking at the options, option G says admissible whether or not the son is available. That seems correct because the exception doesn't depend on the declarant's availability.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the presence of the declarant might make the statement inadmissible if it's not necessary. But no, the exception applies regardless. So the correct answer is G.

Wait, no, because the statement is being offered by the plaintiff, not the son. So the plaintiff's testimony about what the son said is the hearsay. But the exception applies regardless of who offers it.

So the answer should be G: admissible whether or not the son is available.

Wait, but I might be mixing things up. Let me check. The excited utterance exception allows the statement to come in, regardless of the declarant's availability. So the plaintiff's testimony about the son's excited statement is admissible under the exception, even though the son is present.

So the correct answer is D or G? Or perhaps another option.

Wait, looking again, option D says admissible because it gives context to the magnitude. That's a possible reason, but the main reason is the exception.

Wait, but the options don't all mention the exception. So among the options, the best fit is D or G.

Wait, the question is whether the plaintiff's statement is admissible. The statement is hearsay unless an exception applies. The exception is excited utterance, so it's admissible. Therefore, the correct answer is D or G.

Wait, option D says gives context, which is a reason. Option G says admissible regardless of the son's availability, which is correct because the exception doesn't require unavailability.

So the correct answer is G.
</think>

The plaintiff's testimony about his son's scream is admissible under the excited utterance exception to hearsay. The son's statement was made immediately after the explosion, while under the stress of the event, satisfying the requirements of the exception. The availability of the son as a witness does not negate the applicability of the exception. Therefore, the trial judge should not strike the plaintiff's testimony.

Answer: G
