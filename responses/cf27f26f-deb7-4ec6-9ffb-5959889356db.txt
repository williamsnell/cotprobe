Okay, so I've got this biology question here about how the gene pool can be altered. Let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

The question is asking which option correctly states how the gene pool may be altered. The gene pool refers to the collection of all the genes, including all the variations, in a species or population. Changes in the gene pool are essentially changes in the genetic diversity of that group.

Looking at the options:

Option A says cultural practices like selective breeding and dietary preferences. Hmm, selective breeding is definitely a human activity that can alter the gene pool. For example, dog breeding changes the traits of dogs over time. But dietary preferencesâ€”does that affect the gene pool directly? Maybe indirectly if certain diets lead to different survival rates, but I'm not sure if that's a primary method. So A could be a partial answer, but I'm not certain.

Option B: Environmental changes alone. Well, environmental changes can influence natural selection. If the environment changes, certain traits become more or less advantageous, leading to changes in allele frequencies. So environmental changes can definitely alter the gene pool. But does it do so alone? Well, without other factors, maybe. But I think other factors also contribute, so I'm not sure if B is the best answer.

Option C: Use of pesticides and herbicides exclusively. Pesticides and herbicides can affect which organisms survive. For example, they might kill off certain insects or weeds, which could alter gene pools if those species are part of the ecosystem. But "exclusively" is a strong word here. Are there other ways too? So C might not be the most comprehensive answer.

Option D: Genetic engineering only. Genetic engineering can certainly alter the gene pool by introducing specific genes into organisms. But is it the only way? No, because there are natural processes like mutation and natural selection that also change the gene pool. So D is too restrictive.

Option E: Changes in solar radiation only. Solar radiation can cause mutations, which do affect the gene pool. But again, the word "only" makes this too limited. There are other factors besides solar radiation.

Option F: Introduction of non-native species. Introducing new species can lead to hybridization with native species, altering their gene pools. For example, if a non-native plant species crosses with a native one, it can change the gene pool of the native species. So F seems plausible, but is it the only way? Probably not, but the question is about how it may be altered, not the only way.

Option G: Exclusively by extinction. Extinction removes species from the gene pool, but it's not the only way. Gene flow, mutation, selection all play roles too. So G is incorrect because it's too absolute.

Option H: Only through artificial selection. Artificial selection is a form of human selection, but natural selection also changes gene pools. Plus, other factors like mutation and drift are involved. So H is too narrow.

Option I: Factors like mutation, natural selection, migration, genetic drift, and meiotic drive. This seems comprehensive. All these processes can influence allele frequencies, thus altering the gene pool. Mutation introduces new variations, natural selection favors certain traits, migration brings in new genes, genetic drift is random changes, and meiotic drive affects gene transmission. So I think I is a solid answer.

Option J: Natural disasters only. Disasters can cause changes, like bottleneck effects, but they're not the only cause. So J is too limited.

So, putting it together: The correct answer must include multiple factors. Option I includes a variety of processes that can alter the gene pool. Therefore, the answer should be I.

The gene pool can be altered by various factors, including mutation, natural selection, migration, random genetic drift, and meiotic drive. These processes collectively influence allele frequencies and genetic diversity within a population. 

Answer: I
