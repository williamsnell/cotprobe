Alright, I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about permutation groups. The question has two statements, and I need to determine if each is true or false. Then, based on that, pick the correct option from A to J. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's look at Statement 1: "S_n is non-Abelian for all n ≥ 3." Okay, so S_n refers to the symmetric group on n elements. I remember that symmetric groups consist of all permutations of n elements, and their group operation is composition of permutations.

Now, an Abelian group is one where every pair of elements commutes; that is, for any two elements a and b in the group, ab = ba. So, is S_n Abelian or not?

I recall that for n ≥ 3, S_n is not Abelian. Let me think why. Well, in S_3, for example, consider two transpositions, like (1 2) and (1 3). If we compose them, (1 2)(1 3) would be a 3-cycle, and (1 3)(1 2) would be a different 3-cycle. Wait, no, actually, let me compute that properly. 

Wait, (1 2) is swapping 1 and 2, and (1 3) is swapping 1 and 3. If I apply (1 2) first, then (1 3):

Starting with 1: (1 2) takes 1 to 2, then (1 3) takes 2 to 2 (since it only swaps 1 and 3). So overall, 1→2.

Starting with 2: (1 2) takes 2 to 1, then (1 3) takes 1 to 3. So 2→3.

Starting with 3: (1 2) leaves 3 as is, then (1 3) takes 3 to 1. So 3→1.

So the result is the permutation (1 2 3), a 3-cycle.

Now, doing the reverse: (1 3) first, then (1 2).

Starting with 1: (1 3) takes 1 to 3, then (1 2) leaves 3 as is. So 1→3.

Starting with 2: (1 3) leaves 2 as is, then (1 2) takes 2 to 1. So 2→1.

Starting with 3: (1 3) takes 3 to 1, then (1 2) takes 1 to 2. So 3→2.

So the result is the permutation (1 3 2), another 3-cycle. These are different because (1 2 3) ≠ (1 3 2) in cycle notation unless n=3 and the cycles are inverses. So, in S_3, these two elements don't commute. Therefore, S_3 is non-Abelian.

And I think for n > 3, S_n also isn't Abelian. Because if you take elements that don't commute in S_3, they won't commute in S_n either, since S_n includes S_3 as a subgroup. So Statement 1 is true.

Now, moving on to Statement 2: "If a is a permutation that is an m-cycle and b is a permutation that is an n-cycle, then |ab| = lcm(m,n)."

Hmm, okay. |ab| refers to the order of the permutation ab, which is the smallest positive integer k such that (ab)^k is the identity permutation. The lcm(m,n) is the least common multiple of m and n.

I think this is not always true. Let me think of some examples.

Take m=2 and n=3. Let a be (1 2), a transposition, and b be (1 3 4), a 3-cycle.

Compute ab: Let's see, a is (1 2), b is (1 3 4). So ab is the composition: first apply b, then a.

So ab would be: 1 → 3 → 2 (since a sends 3 to 3, then 3 is sent to 2 via a? Wait, no. Wait, in permutation composition, we apply the right permutation first. So when you write ab, it's a after b. So for ab, you do b first, then a.

Wait, that's a common point of confusion. Let me clarify: when you write permutations as functions, the composition is ab = a∘b, so you apply b first, then a. So, for each element x, (ab)(x) = a(b(x)).

So for a = (1 2), which swaps 1 and 2, and b = (1 3 4), which cycles 1→3, 3→4, 4→1.

Compute ab:

For x=1: b sends 1→3, then a sends 3→3 (since a only swaps 1 and 2). So ab(1)=3.

x=2: b sends 2→2 (since it's not in the cycle), then a sends 2→1. So ab(2)=1.

x=3: b sends 3→4, then a leaves 4 as is. So ab(3)=4.

x=4: b sends 4→1, then a sends 1→2. So ab(4)=2.

So the permutation ab maps 1→3, 2→1, 3→4, 4→2. So in cycle notation, that's (1 3 4 2), which is a 4-cycle. So the order of ab is 4, which is the lcm(2,3)=6? Wait, no, 4 isn't equal to 6. So in this case, |ab|=4, which is less than lcm(2,3)=6. So the statement is false in this case.

Wait, but maybe I chose a bad example. Let me try another example where m and n are coprime. Suppose m=2 and n=3 again, but different cycles. Let a=(1 2) and b=(2 3 4). Let's compute ab.

Again, ab is a∘b. So for each x:

x=1: b leaves 1 as is, so a sends 1→2. So ab(1)=2.

x=2: b sends 2→3, then a sends 3→3. So ab(2)=3.

x=3: b sends 3→4, then a leaves 4 as is. So ab(3)=4.

x=4: b sends 4→2, then a sends 2→1. So ab(4)=1.

So ab is the permutation (1 2 3 4), a 4-cycle. Again, |ab|=4, which is not equal to lcm(2,3)=6. So the order is 4, not 6.

Wait, but maybe I should choose cycles that don't interfere with each other. Like a=(1 2) and b=(3 4 5). Then ab would be the product of a 2-cycle and a 3-cycle that are disjoint. In that case, the order of ab would be lcm(2,3)=6 because disjoint cycles commute and their orders multiply as lcm. Wait, no, wait. If a and b are disjoint, then ab is a product of cycles of lengths m and n, which commute, so their product's order is lcm(m,n). But in the earlier examples, the cycles were not disjoint, so the product's order could be less.

Wait, but the original statement says "a is an m-cycle and b is an n-cycle." It doesn't specify that they are disjoint. So in general, when a and b are not disjoint, |ab| could be less than lcm(m,n). Therefore, the statement is not always true. So Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but wait another moment. What if m and n are coprime and the cycles share some elements? Does that affect the order? For example, let a=(1 2 3) (m=3) and b=(1 4 5 6) (n=4). So m=3 and n=4, which are coprime. Let's compute ab.

ab is a∘b. Let's see where each element goes:

1: b sends 1→4, then a leaves 4 as is. So ab(1)=4.

4: b sends 4→5, a leaves 5 as is. ab(4)=5.

5: b sends5→6, a leaves 6 as is. ab(5)=6.

6: b sends6→1, a sends1→2. So ab(6)=2.

2: a sends2→3, b leaves 3 as is. So ab(2)=3.

3: a sends3→1, b sends1→4. So ab(3)=4.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me track each element:

ab(1) = a(b(1)) = a(4) = 4 (since a only moves 1,2,3).

ab(2) = a(b(2)) = a(2) = 3.

ab(3) = a(b(3)) = a(3) = 1.

ab(4) = a(b(4)) = a(5) =5.

ab(5) = a(b(5)) = a(6)=6.

ab(6) = a(b(6)) = a(1)=2.

So the permutation ab is:

1→4, 4→5, 5→6, 6→2, 2→3, 3→1. So the cycle is (1 4 5 6 2 3), which is a 6-cycle. So |ab|=6, which is lcm(3,4)=12? Wait, no, 6 is less than 12. Wait, that's not matching. Wait, 3 and 4 are coprime, so lcm is 12. But the order here is 6, which is less than 12. So again, |ab|=6, which is not equal to lcm(3,4)=12. Therefore, the statement is false.

Wait, but in this case, the cycles shared an element (1), which might have caused the order to be lower. But in another case where cycles are disjoint, the order would be lcm(m,n). So the statement is only true when the cycles are disjoint. But the original statement doesn't specify that a and b are disjoint cycles. So in general, the order could be less than lcm(m,n). Therefore, Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but let me think again. Suppose a is an m-cycle and b is an n-cycle, but they are not disjoint. Do we have any case where |ab|=lcm(m,n)? Or is it possible that sometimes it's equal, sometimes not?

For example, let a=(1 2 3) and b=(2 4 5). So m=3, n=3. Compute ab.

ab(1)=a(b(1))=a(1)=2.

ab(2)=a(b(2))=a(4)=4.

ab(3)=a(b(3))=a(5)=5.

ab(4)=a(b(4))=a(5)=5.

ab(5)=a(b(5))=a(2)=3.

Wait, that seems off. Let me compute each step carefully.

Wait, b is (2 4 5), so:

b(1)=1.

b(2)=4.

b(4)=5.

b(5)=2.

So ab is a∘b:

ab(1)=a(b(1))=a(1)=2.

ab(2)=a(b(2))=a(4)=4 (since a only moves 1,2,3; 4 is fixed).

ab(3)=a(b(3))=a(3)=1.

ab(4)=a(b(4))=a(5)=5.

ab(5)=a(b(5))=a(2)=3.

So ab is the permutation:

1→2,

2→4,

4→5,

5→3,

3→1.

So this is a cycle: (1 2 4 5 3), which is a 5-cycle. So |ab|=5. The lcm of 3 and 3 is 3, but |ab|=5, which is greater than 3. Wait, no, 5 is not equal to 3. So in this case, |ab| is 5, which is not equal to lcm(3,3)=3. So again, the statement doesn't hold.

Wait, but what if a and b are both 2-cycles and disjoint? Then ab would have order lcm(2,2)=2, which is correct. But the statement doesn't specify that a and b are disjoint.

So from the examples I've tried, when a and b are disjoint, |ab|=lcm(m,n). But when they are not disjoint, it can be different. Therefore, the general statement is not always true. So Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think of another example where a and b are not disjoint but |ab|=lcm(m,n). Suppose a is (1 2 3 4) (m=4) and b is (1 5 6 7) (n=4). These are not disjoint because they share 1. Let's compute ab.

ab is a∘b, so first apply b, then a.

Compute ab(1):

b sends 1→5, then a sends 5 to 5 (since a only moves 1-4). So ab(1)=5.

ab(5): b sends5→6, a sends6→6. So ab(5)=6.

ab(6): b sends6→7, a leaves7. ab(6)=7.

ab(7): b sends7→1, a sends1→2. So ab(7)=2.

ab(2): a sends2→3, b leaves3 as is. So ab(2)=3.

ab(3): a sends3→4, b leaves4 as is. So ab(3)=4.

ab(4): a sends4→1, b sends1→5. So ab(4)=5.

Wait, that seems a bit tangled. Let me try to write out the permutation:

ab(1)=5,

ab(5)=6,

ab(6)=7,

ab(7)=2,

ab(2)=3,

ab(3)=4,

ab(4)=1.

So the permutation is (1 5 6 7 2 3 4). That's a 7-cycle. So the order is 7. The lcm of 4 and 4 is 4, but |ab|=7, which is not equal. So again, the statement fails.

Hmm. So in all these cases, when a and b are not disjoint, |ab| can be different, sometimes higher, sometimes lower. So the general statement that |ab|=lcm(m,n) is not always true. It only holds when a and b are disjoint cycles.

Therefore, Statement 2 is false.

So putting it all together:

Statement 1: True.

Statement 2: False.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Depends on the values of n, True → No, Statement 1 is always true for n≥3.

B: False, False → No, Statement 1 is true.

C: True, True → No, Statement 2 is false.

D: Depends on the values of m and n, False → No, Statement 2 is always false unless maybe m or n is 1? Wait, no. Wait, if either m or n is 1, then the cycles are just transpositions or fixed points. Let me think. If a is a 1-cycle (which is trivial, just the identity), then ab would be b, so |ab|=n. Similarly, if b is a 1-cycle, |ab|=m. So in those cases, |ab| would be m or n, which is the lcm(m,1)=m or n. So in that case, the statement would be true. But since the statement doesn't specify that m and n are greater than 1, it could be true in some cases. Wait, but the question says a is an m-cycle and b is an n-cycle. A 1-cycle is just the identity permutation. So if either m or n is 1, then the other is the lcm. But in general, for m,n ≥2, the statement is false.

Wait, but the original statement doesn't specify any restrictions on m and n. So if m=1 and n=1, then |ab|=1, which is lcm(1,1)=1. If m=1 and n=2, then |ab|=2, which is lcm(1,2)=2. So in those cases, the statement would be true. But in other cases, like m=2 and n=3, it's false. So the statement's truth depends on the values of m and n. So Statement 2 is not always false; it can be true in some cases.

Wait, but in the examples I tried earlier, when m and n are both greater than 1 and the cycles are not disjoint, the order is not lcm(m,n). But if the cycles are disjoint, then |ab|=lcm(m,n). Also, if one of them is a 1-cycle, then |ab| is the other's length, which is the lcm. So the statement is true if the cycles are disjoint or if either is a 1-cycle. Otherwise, it's false.

So the statement is not universally true; it depends on the specific permutations a and b, i.e., on m and n and whether the cycles are disjoint. Therefore, Statement 2 is not always false; sometimes it's true. So the overall statement is conditionally true based on m and n.

Wait, but the original statement didn't specify any conditions. It said, "If a is a permutation that is an m-cycle and b is a permutation that is an n-cycle, then |ab| = lcm(m,n)." So the statement is making a general claim without any conditions. Therefore, since it's not always true (it's sometimes false), the statement is false as a general rule.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me clarify:

- If a and b are disjoint, then |ab|=lcm(m,n). So in that case, the statement holds.

- If a and b are not disjoint, then |ab| can be less than or greater than lcm(m,n), depending on the specifics.

So the statement is sometimes true and sometimes false, depending on the cycles a and b. Therefore, as a general statement, it's not always true. So Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but the options are about whether each statement is true or false. So Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false.

Looking back at the options:

Option E: False, True → No, because Statement 1 is true.

Option I: True, False → Yes, this would be correct.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Options:

A: Depends on the values of n, True → No, Statement 1 is always true.

B: False, False → No, Statement 1 is true.

C: True, True → No, Statement 2 is false.

D: Depends on the values of m and n, False → No, because Statement 1 is always true.

E: False, True → No, because Statement 1 is true.

F: False, Depends on the values of m and n → No, because Statement 2 is false, not depends.

G: Depends on the values of n, False → No.

H: Depends on the values of m and n, True → No.

I: True, False → Yes, this matches: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false.

J: True, Depends on the values of m and n → No, because Statement 2 is false.

So the correct option is I: True, False.
</think>

The first statement is true because the symmetric group \( S_n \) is non-Abelian for all \( n \geq 3 \). The second statement is false because the order of the product of two cycles is not always the least common multiple of their lengths unless they are disjoint or one is trivial.
