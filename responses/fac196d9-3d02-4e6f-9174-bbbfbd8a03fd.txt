Question:

A homeowner buys a new leaf blower and is so impressed with its power that he gets carried away and blows large amounts of his work onto the next door neighbor's yard. In addition to leaves, he also blew large amounts of pest-infested plant debris onto the neighbor's property. The material has accumulated into large, unsightly piles and caused damage to the neighbor's healthy plants. He has to pay workers to haul the material away and he incurs expenses to replace infected perennials. The neighbor sues for the tort of trespass. The homeowner files a motion to dismiss because the neighbor cannot prove that homeowner acted with an intent to trespass or to do harm. Will the court grant the motion to dismiss?

Options:

A: Yes, because the homeowner expected the wind to carry the debris away and did not think that it would accumulate on the neighbor's property.
B: No, because the homeowner's actions resulted in a direct invasion of the neighbor's property.
C: Yes, because the debris was not intentionally directed at the neighbor's property.
D: Yes, because the homeowner was not aware of the pest-infested debris.
E: No, because the neighbor was able to prove financial loss from the damage caused.
F: No, because trespass is based on an intentional act of entering the land or sending something onto the land, and the actor does not have to intend harm to be liable for the tort.
G: Yes, because the homeowner had no practical way of controlling where the material went and he acted without malice or ill will.
H: Yes, because the homeowner did not physically enter the neighbor's property.
I: No, because the infected debris constituted an abnormally dangerous condition and homeowner could be held strictly liable for the trespass.
J: No, because the act of blowing debris onto the neighbor's land constitutes a trespass regardless of intent.

Okay, so I have this tort question about trespass, and I need to figure out whether the court will grant the motion to dismiss. Let me break it down step by step.

The situation is that a homeowner bought a new leaf blower, which is powerful. He got so impressed that he overdid it and blew a lot of his work onto the neighbor's yard. Along with leaves, he blew pest-infested plant debris. This caused big piles that are unsightly, damaged the neighbor's healthy plants, and the neighbor had to pay workers to remove the debris and replace the infected plants. The neighbor is suing for trespass, and the homeowner is arguing that he didn't have the intent to trespass or do harm, so the case should be dismissed.

I remember that trespass to land is about intentional entry onto another's land without permission. But wait, sometimes it's not just about intent to trespass, but intent to commit the act that causes the invasion. So, if someone intentionally does something that results in their property (like leaves or debris) ending up on another's land, does that count as trespass?

Trespass can be either intentional or negligent. Intentional trespass requires that the defendant intended to commit the act that entered the plaintiff's land. Negligent trespass would involve not intending but acting carelessly. But in this case, the homeowner blew debris onto the neighbor's yard. Did he intend to send it there? The question says he got carried away and blew large amounts, so maybe he didn't intend to target the neighbor's property. But trespass can sometimes be strict liability if it's an abnormally dangerous activity, but I'm not sure if blowing leaves counts as that.

Looking at the options, let's go through them.

Option A: Says the homeowner didn't expect debris to land there. But expectation isn't the same as intent. If he intended to blow leaves but not to land on neighbor's land, does that matter? Maybe not, because the act of blowing could be considered intentional if he intended to blow, regardless of where it lands. So A might not be correct.

Option B: Says it's a direct invasion. But trespass requires intent to enter. If he didn't intend to send debris to neighbor's land, maybe B isn't right.

Option C: States that the debris wasn't intentionally directed. So if the homeowner didn't aim it at the neighbor's property, maybe it's not intentional. But I think even if it's not aimed, if he intended to blow, and that action resulted in debris on neighbor's land, it might still count. Or maybe not. I'm a bit confused here.

Option D: He wasn't aware of the pest debris. But trespass doesn't require knowledge of the specific harm (like pests), just the act of entering the land. So D might not be a valid reason for dismissal.

Option E: Neighbor proved financial loss. But the motion is about whether there's a case, not whether damages were proven. So E might not address the intent issue.

Option F: Says trespass doesn't require intent to harm, just intent to enter. So even if he didn't mean to harm, if he intended to blow (which caused the debris to land), that could be enough. So F seems correct.

Option G: He couldn't control where it went. But that's more about negligence, like if he took reasonable care. But the motion is about intent, not negligence. So G might not be the right reason for dismissal.

Option H: He didn't enter the land physically. But trespass can be by sending something onto the land, like throwing an object or, in this case, blowing debris. So H is incorrect because the debris did enter the land.

Option I: Strict liability for an abnormally dangerous condition. Blowing leaves and debris doesn't seem abnormally dangerous, so I think I is incorrect.

Option J: Act of blowing debris constitutes trespass regardless of intent. But wait, trespass generally requires intent. However, if the act is intentional, even without intent to trespass or harm, it might still be trespass. Or does it require intent to enter the land?

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me clarify. Trespass to land can be committed intentionally or negligently. For intentional trespass, the defendant must have intended to commit the act that caused the invasion. So if the homeowner intentionally blew the debris, even if he didn't intend to land it on the neighbor's yard, the act of blowing could be considered intentional. Therefore, the intent to blow is sufficient, regardless of where he thought it would go.

So looking back at the options, F says, "No, because trespass is based on an intentional act of entering the land or sending something onto the land, and the actor does not have to intend harm to be liable for the tort." That sounds correct because the homeowner intended to blow the debris, which ended up on the neighbor's land. The intent to commit the act (blowing) is enough, even if he didn't intend the specific harm or the specific location.

Alternatively, J says, "No, because the act of blowing debris onto the neighbor's land constitutes a trespass regardless of intent." But I think J is incorrect because intent is still required for trespass. It's not strict liability in this context unless it's an abnormally dangerous activity, which it's not here.

So the correct answer should be F.

The court will not grant the motion to dismiss because the homeowner's intentional act of blowing debris onto the neighbor's property constitutes trespass, regardless of whether he intended harm or the specific location. Trespass to land requires only the intent to commit the act that results in the invasion, not the intent to cause harm. Therefore, the correct answer is:

F: No, because trespass is based on an intentional act of entering the land or sending something onto the land, and the actor does not have to intend harm to be liable for the tort.
