Okay, so I have this logic problem to solve. It's about determining whether a set of propositions is consistent using indirect truth tables. If the set is consistent, I need to pick the correct consistent valuation from the given options.

The propositions given are:

1. (E ⊃ F) ⊃ G
2. (~E ∨ F) ≡ (H ∨ I)
3. I ⊃ (J ⊃ ~H)
4. ~G ⊃ ~J

And the options are A through H, each either stating the set is inconsistent or providing a consistent valuation.

First, I need to understand what an indirect truth table is. From what I remember, an indirect truth table is used to check for consistency by assuming the set is inconsistent and then deriving a contradiction. So, if I can derive a contradiction by assuming all the propositions are true, then the set is inconsistent. If I can't, then the set is consistent.

But since the question also asks to choose a consistent valuation if it's consistent, I might need to check which option's valuation makes all propositions true.

Let me list the propositions again:

1. (E → F) → G
2. (~E ∨ F) ≡ (H ∨ I)
3. I → (J → ~H)
4. ~G → ~J

I think it's easier to approach this by assuming each option's valuation and checking whether all four propositions are true under that valuation. Alternatively, I could try to find a common assignment that satisfies all four.

Let me look at the options:

Option A: E, F, G, H, I are true; J is false.

Let me plug these values into each proposition.

1. (E→F)→G: E is true, F is true, so E→F is true. G is true, so true→true is true. So proposition 1 holds.

2. (~E ∨ F) ≡ (H ∨ I): ~E is false, F is true → ~E∨F is true. H is true, I is true → H∨I is true. So true ≡ true is true. Proposition 2 holds.

3. I → (J → ~H): I is true. J is false, so J→~H. ~H is false. So J→~H is false. So I→(something false) is false. So proposition 3 is false. Wait, that's a problem. Because if proposition 3 is false, then the set can't be consistent because all propositions must be true. So option A would make proposition 3 false, which would mean the set is inconsistent. But option A says it's consistent. So maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I calculated proposition 3 incorrectly. Let me check again.

Proposition 3: I → (J → ~H). Given I is true, J is false, and H is true.

J → ~H: J is false, ~H is false. So J→~H is equivalent to (J→~H) which is (F→F). An implication is only false when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. So F→F is true. So the inner part J→~H is true because F→F is true.

Then I → (true). So I is true, so I→true is true. So proposition 3 is true. Oh, I think I messed up earlier. Because J is false, so J→~H is F→F, which is true. So I→(true) is true. So proposition 3 holds.

Wait, no, J is false, so J→~H is (F → F), which is true. So proposition 3 is true.

So with option A, all propositions are true. So option A is a consistent valuation. So option A is possible.

But I need to check all options to see which one is correct. Let's see option B.

Option B: E is true, F, G, H, I, J are false.

So E=T, F=F, G=F, H=F, I=F, J=F.

Check each proposition:

1. (E→F)→G: E→F is T→F, which is F. So the antecedent is F. So F→G. G is F. So F→F is T. So proposition 1 holds.

2. (~E ∨ F) ≡ (H ∨ I): ~E is F, F is F. So F∨F=F. H=F, I=F. So H∨I=F. So F≡F is T. Proposition 2 holds.

3. I→(J→~H): I=F. So F→anything is T. So proposition 3 holds.

4. ~G→~J: G=F, so ~G=T. J=F, so ~J=T. So T→T is T. Proposition 4 holds.

So option B makes all propositions true. So option B is also a consistent valuation.

Wait, but the question says to choose an option where the set is consistent and the valuation is correct. So if both A and B are possible, but the options are different, then perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, no. The options are A through H, each with a different valuation. I need to see which one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the set is consistent, but some options may not satisfy all propositions. Let me check each option's valuation.

Option C: E, F, I are true; G, H, J are false.

So E=T, F=T, I=T; G=F, H=F, J=F.

Check each proposition:

1. (E→F)→G: E→F is T→T=T. So T→G, which is F. So T→F=F. So proposition 1 is false. So option C is invalid because it makes proposition 1 false. So option C is inconsistent, but the option says it's consistent. So option C is wrong.

Option D says inconsistent. So if both A and B are consistent, then D is incorrect.

Option E: E, G, H are true; F, I, J are false.

E=T, G=T, H=T; F=F, I=F, J=F.

Check propositions:

1. (E→F)→G: E→F is T→F=F. So F→G (which is T). So F→T is T. So proposition 1 holds.

2. (~E ∨ F) ≡ (H ∨ I): ~E=F, F=F. So F∨F=F. H=T, I=F. H∨I=T. So F≡T is F. So proposition 2 is false. So option E is invalid.

Option F: E, F, G are true; H, I, J are false.

E=T, F=T, G=T; H=F, I=F, J=F.

Check:

1. (E→F)→G: E→F=T→T=T. T→G=T→T=T. So holds.

2. (~E ∨ F) ≡ (H ∨ I): ~E=F, F=T. So F∨T=T. H=F, I=F. H∨I=F. So T≡F=F. So proposition 2 is false. So option F is invalid.

Option G: E and I are true; F, G, H, J are false.

E=T, I=T; F=F, G=F, H=F, J=F.

Check:

1. (E→F)→G: E→F=T→F=F. F→G=F→F=T. So holds.

2. (~E ∨ F) ≡ (H ∨ I): ~E=F, F=F → F∨F=F. H=F, I=T → H∨I=T. So F≡T=F. So proposition 2 is false. So option G is invalid.

Option H: E and H are true; F, G, I, J are false.

E=T, H=T; F=F, G=F, I=F, J=F.

Check:

1. (E→F)→G: E→F=T→F=F. F→G=F→F=T. So holds.

2. (~E ∨ F) ≡ (H ∨ I): ~E=F, F=F → F∨F=F. H=T, I=F → H∨I=T. So F≡T=F. So proposition 2 is false. So option H is invalid.

So from the options, both A and B are consistent valuations. But looking back, the options are A through H, each with their own valuations. So perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating one of them.

Wait, let me recheck option B: E=T, F=F, G=F, H=F, I=F, J=F.

Proposition 3: I→(J→~H). I is F, so F→anything is T. So proposition 3 holds.

Proposition 4: ~G→~J. G=F → ~G=T. J=F → ~J=T. So T→T=T. So proposition 4 holds.

So option B's valuation makes all propositions true. So option B is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought option A also worked. Let me check option A again.

Option A: E=T, F=T, G=T, H=T, I=T, J=F.

Proposition 3: I→(J→~H). I=T. J=F. ~H=F (since H=T). So J→~H is F→F, which is T. So I→(T) is T. So proposition 3 holds.

So both A and B are correct? But the options present them as separate options, so perhaps the question allows multiple, but the options are given as A to H, each with a different valuation.

Wait, but looking at the options, they all have different valuations. So perhaps the correct answer is both A and B are correct, but since the options don't have multiple correct answers, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, but the question says "select the option with a consistent valuation". So perhaps there's only one correct option, but in reality, both A and B are correct. But looking at the options, maybe only A is correct, or only B.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option B's proposition 2.

Option B: proposition 2 is (~E∨F) ≡ (H∨I).

~E is F (since E=T), F=F. So ~E∨F=F∨F=F.

H=F, I=F. So H∨I=F. So F ≡ F is T. So proposition 2 holds.

So both A and B are correct, but the options don't have both as correct. So perhaps the question expects only one of them, but I'm confused because both seem correct.

Wait, but looking back at the options, the user provided options A to H, each with a specific valuation. So perhaps the correct answer is A and B are both correct, but since the options are given as A, B, etc., I need to see which one is correct.

Wait, but the options are presented as A: Consistent with valuation A, B: Consistent with valuation B, etc. So the question is asking to select which option is correct, i.e., which valuation makes the set consistent.

Since both A and B are correct, but the options present them as separate, perhaps the answer is both A and B are correct, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating one of them.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating proposition 3 for option B. Let me recheck.

Option B: I=F, J=F.

Proposition 3: I→(J→~H). I=F, so F→anything is T. So proposition 3 holds.

Yes, that's correct. So both A and B are correct valuations. But in the options, only one can be correct. So perhaps the answer is both A and B are correct, but the options don't present that. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is to determine if the set is consistent, and if so, choose an option with a consistent valuation. So if the set is consistent, then any valuation that makes all propositions true is correct. So perhaps both A and B are correct, but the options present them as separate, so perhaps the answer is both, but in the options, only one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating one of them. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps the set is inconsistent, but I'm not seeing it. Let me try to see if there's any contradiction in the set.

Let me try to derive a contradiction.

We have:

1. (E→F)→G
2. (~E∨F) ≡ (H∨I)
3. I→(J→~H)
4. ~G→~J

Assume all are true, and see if it leads to a contradiction.

From 4: ~G→~J is equivalent to J→G. So if J is true, then G must be true.

From 1: (E→F)→G. So if (E→F) is true, then G must be true.

From 2: (~E∨F) ≡ (H∨I). So they are equivalent.

From 3: I→(J→~H). So if I is true, then J→~H must be true.

Let me assume J is true. Then from 4, since J→G, G must be true.

If G is true, then from 1, (E→F)→G is true. So if (E→F) is false, G can be anything, but if (E→F) is true, then G must be true.

Now, let's see if J can be true. Suppose J is true, so G is true.

From 2: (~E∨F) ≡ (H∨I). Let's assume E is true. Then ~E is false, so (~E∨F) is F∨F=F if F is false, or F∨T=T if F is true.

Wait, let's try to find a valuation where J is true.

If J is true, then from 4, G is true.

If G is true, from 1, (E→F)→G is true. So if (E→F) is true, then G must be true, which it is. If (E→F) is false, then G can be anything, but G is true.

Now, from 3: I→(J→~H). Since J is true, J→~H is ~H. So if I is true, then ~H must be true, so H must be false.

From 2: (~E∨F) ≡ (H∨I). Let's see, H is false (because I is true and from 3, I→(J→~H) requires H to be false when I is true). So H∨I would be F∨T=T. On the left, (~E∨F) could be T or F depending on E and F.

If E is true, then ~E is F. So left side is F∨F=F. Right side is T. So F≡T=F, which is a contradiction. So this can't happen.

Alternatively, if E is false, then ~E is T. So left side is T∨F=T. Right side is H∨I=T. So T≡T=T, which holds.

So if E is false, then all holds. So let's see:

E=F, F can be anything because E is false, so (E→F)=T regardless of F.

Let me set E=F, F=T. Then from 2: (~E∨F)=T∨T=T. H=F, I=T. So H∨I=T. So T≡T=T.

From 3: I=T, so J→~H must be T. J=T, so ~H must be T. So H=F.

From 4: J=T→G=T, which is fine.

From 1: (E→F)=(F→T)=T. So T→G=T→T=T. So holds.

So this is a consistent valuation: E=F, F=T, G=T, H=F, I=T, J=T.

Wait, but none of the options match this. The options have E=T or F=T, etc. So perhaps the set is consistent, but the options provided (A and B) are also consistent.

Wait, but earlier, when I checked option B, E=T, F=F, G=F, H=F, I=F, J=F. Let me see if this is possible.

In option B, E=T, F=F, G=F, H=F, I=F, J=F.

From proposition 4: ~G→~J. G=F→~G=T. J=F→~J=T. So T→T=T. Holds.

Proposition 1: (E→F)→G. E=T, F=F→E→F=F. F→G=F→F=T. So holds.

Proposition 2: (~E∨F)=F∨F=F. H∨I=F∨F=F. So F≡F=T. Holds.

Proposition 3: I=F→F→anything=T. So holds.

So option B is a valid consistent valuation.

Similarly, option A: E=T, F=T, G=T, H=T, I=T, J=F.

Check proposition 3: I=T→(J=F→~H). ~H=F because H=T. So J=F→~H=F→F=T. So I=T→T=T. So holds.

Proposition 2: (~E∨F)=F∨T=T. H∨I=T∨T=T. So T≡T=T. Holds.

Proposition 1: (E→F)=T→T=T. T→G=T→T=T. Holds.

Proposition 4: ~G=F→~J=T. F→T=T. So holds.

So both A and B are correct. But the options are given as separate, so perhaps both are correct, but the answer choices don't allow multiple selections. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the set is inconsistent because there's no possible assignment that satisfies all, but I found at least two (A and B), so the set must be consistent.

So, the options are:

A: Consistent, valuation A

B: Consistent, valuation B

C: Consistent, valuation C (but it's invalid)

D: Inconsistent

E: Consistent, valuation E (invalid)

F: Consistent, valuation F (invalid)

G: Consistent, valuation G (invalid)

H: Consistent, valuation H (invalid)

So the correct options are A and B, but since the options are presented as A to H, and the question asks to choose the correct one, perhaps both A and B are correct, but in the given options, only one can be selected. Wait, but looking back at the problem, the user provided options A to H, each with a different valuation. So the correct answer would be either A or B.

But the options are presented as separate, so perhaps the answer is that the set is consistent, and one of the options (A or B) is correct. Since the user is asking to choose from A to J, but the options are A to H, perhaps the correct answer is either A or B.

But I think the correct answer is that the set is consistent, and both A and B are correct valuations. But since the options are separate, perhaps the answer is that the set is consistent, and the correct option is either A or B.

Wait, but the problem says "choose an option with a consistent valuation". So I need to pick which of the options (A to H) provides a consistent valuation.

From my analysis, both A and B are correct. But looking back at the options, perhaps only one is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating one of them.

Wait, perhaps option B is incorrect because in proposition 3, I→(J→~H) with I=F makes the implication true regardless of J and H. So option B is correct.

Similarly, option A is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is that the set is consistent, and options A and B are correct. But the given options don't have that, so perhaps the answer is that the set is consistent, and one of the options is correct.

But the problem says "select an option with a consistent valuation", so perhaps the answer is either A or B.

But looking back, perhaps the correct answer is option B. Wait, why? Because in option A, when I checked earlier, I thought proposition 3 was false, but then realized it was true. So option A is correct.

Wait, perhaps the answer is both A and B are correct, but the options don't allow selecting both, so perhaps the answer is that the set is consistent, and the correct options are A and B.

But since the options are given as separate, perhaps the answer is that the set is consistent, and the correct option is either A or B.

But I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps I should proceed to the step-by-step explanation and choose the correct option based on the valuations.
</think>

To determine whether the set of propositions is consistent, we analyze each option's valuation to see if all propositions hold true.

1. **Option A**: E=T, F=T, G=T, H=T, I=T, J=F.
   - Proposition 1: (E→F)=T→T=T; T→G=T→T=T.
   - Proposition 2: (~E∨F)=F∨T=T; (H∨I)=T∨T=T; T≡T=T.
   - Proposition 3: I=T→(J→~H)=T→(F→F)=T→T=T.
   - Proposition 4: ~G=F→~J=T; F→T=T.
   - All propositions hold; consistent.

2. **Option B**: E=T, F=F, G=F, H=F, I=F, J=F.
   - Proposition 1: (E→F)=T→F=F; F→G=F→F=T.
   - Proposition 2: (~E∨F)=F∨F=F; (H∨I)=F∨F=F; F≡F=T.
   - Proposition 3: I=F→(J→~H)=F→(F→F)=F→T=T.
   - Proposition 4: ~G=T→~J=T; T→T=T.
   - All propositions hold; consistent.

3. **Option C**: E=T, F=T, I=T; G=F, H=F, J=F.
   - Proposition 1: (E→F)=T→T=T; T→G=T→F=F.
   - Proposition 1 fails; inconsistent.

4. **Option D**: Inconsistent.
   - Incorrect, as both A and B are consistent.

5. **Option E**: E=T, G=T, H=T; F=F, I=F, J=F.
   - Proposition 2: (~E∨F)=F∨F=F; (H∨I)=T∨F=T; F≡T=F.
   - Proposition 2 fails; inconsistent.

6. **Option F**: E=T, F=T, G=T; H=F, I=F, J=F.
   - Proposition 2: (~E∨F)=F∨T=T; (H∨I)=F∨F=F; T≡F=F.
   - Proposition 2 fails; inconsistent.

7. **Option G**: E=T, I=T; F=F, G=F, H=F, J=F.
   - Proposition 2: (~E∨F)=F∨F=F; (H∨I)=F∨T=T; F≡T=F.
   - Proposition 2 fails; inconsistent.

8. **Option H**: E=T, H=T; F=F, G=F, I=F, J=F.
   - Proposition 2: (~E∨F)=F∨F=F; (H∨I)=T∨F=T; F≡T=F.
   - Proposition 2 fails; inconsistent.

Both **Option A** and **Option B** are consistent valuations. However, since the question asks to select one option, **Option A** is chosen as it aligns with the first valid valuation found.

**Answer: A**
