Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electrons moving in a magnetic field. Hmm, I remember from my notes that when a charged particle moves perpendicular to a magnetic field, it experiences a force that makes it move in a circular path. The formula for the radius of that circle, I think, is r = (mv)/(qB), where m is mass, v is velocity, q is charge, and B is the magnetic field. 

Wait, but electrons are negatively charged, does that matter? Oh right, the formula uses the magnitude of the charge, so the direction doesn't affect the radius calculation. Good, so I can proceed without worrying about the sign.

The problem gives me the speed of the electrons as 10^7 m/s. That's 10 million meters per second. The magnetic field of the Earth is given as 5 × 10^-5 T, which is 50 microteslas. I think Earth's magnetic field varies, but this value seems reasonable.

So I need to find the radius r. Let me note down the known values:

- Velocity (v) = 10^7 m/s
- Magnetic field (B) = 5e-5 T
- Charge of electron (q) = 1.6e-19 coulombs
- Mass of electron (m) = 9.11e-31 kg

Plugging these into the formula: r = (m*v)/(q*B). Let me compute that step by step.

First, calculate the numerator: m*v = (9.11e-31 kg) * (1e7 m/s). Let me compute that. 9.11e-31 multiplied by 1e7 is 9.11e-24 kg·m/s.

Next, the denominator: q*B = (1.6e-19 C) * (5e-5 T). Multiplying these gives 8e-24 C·T. Wait, let me check: 1.6e-19 * 5e-5 is (1.6 *5)=8, and exponents are 1e-24 because -19 + (-5)= -24.

So now, r = (9.11e-24) / (8e-24). The exponents cancel out since 1e-24 divided by 1e-24 is 1. So 9.11 / 8 is approximately 1.13875. So the radius is about 1.13875 meters. Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 1m, which is close. But wait, let me think again. Did I compute that correctly?

Wait, wait, let me recheck the calculation because I might have made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, m*v is 9.11e-31 * 1e7 = 9.11e-24. That's correct. q*B is 1.6e-19 * 5e-5. 1.6e-19 times 5e-5 is 8e-24. Yep. So 9.11e-24 / 8e-24 is indeed about 1.138. So the radius is approximately 1.14 meters. So looking at the options, option E is 1m, which is the closest.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up any numbers. Oh, wait, another thought: I remember sometimes when using formulas, especially with SI units, it's crucial to get the exponents right. Let me do the calculation again.

Calculating numerator: 9.11e-31 kg * 1e7 m/s = 9.11e-24 kg·m/s.

Denominator: 1.6e-19 C * 5e-5 T. 1.6 *5 is 8, and exponents: 1e-19 * 1e-5 is 1e-24. So denominator is 8e-24.

So 9.11e-24 divided by 8e-24 equals (9.11/8) * (1e-24/1e-24) = 1.13875 * 1 = 1.13875 meters. So approximately 1.14 meters.

Looking at the options, E is 1m, which is the closest. But wait, the options are A to J. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 0.1 m
B: 1 mm
C: 1 μm
D: 0.01 m
E: 1 m
F: 10 m
G: 1 cm
H: 1 km
I: 1 nm
J: 100 m

So 1.14 m is close to 1m. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused because sometimes in these problems, you might have to consider other factors, but I don't think so here. The formula seems straightforward.

Wait, another thought: Did I mix up the units anywhere? Let's double-check. Velocity is in m/s, mass in kg, charge in C, B in T. Yes, all SI units, so the result should be in meters.

Hmm, but another approach: What if I compute the radius using the formula r = mv/(qB), but perhaps I can compute it numerically more accurately.

So, m = 9.10938356e-31 kg (exact value), v = 1e7 m/s, q = 1.602176634e-19 C, B=5e-5 T.

So, m*v = 9.10938356e-31 * 1e7 = 9.10938356e-24.

q*B = 1.602176634e-19 *5e-5 = 8.01088317e-24.

So r = 9.10938356e-24 /8.01088317e-24 ≈ approx (9.10938356 /8.01088317) ≈ let's see, 9.109 /8.0108 ≈ 1.137.

So about 1.137 meters, which is about 1.14 meters. So that's approximately 1.14 m. So the closest option is E: 1m. But wait, wait a second. Is there any other factor I'm missing? Maybe whether the velocity is perpendicular to the magnetic field? Oh, right, because the formula assumes that the velocity is perpendicular. If it's not, then the radius would be different, but the problem states it's bending into a circle, so the velocity must be perpendicular, which means the entire magnetic force is providing the centripetal force. So the formula applies.

Wait, but wait, am I using the right formula? The centripetal force is provided by the magnetic Lorentz force, which is F = qvB, since F = q(v × B), and when perpendicular, it's maximum. Then, F = mv²/r = qvB. Solving for r: r = mv/(qB). Yep, that's correct.

So, with r around 1.14 m, the closest option is E: 1 m. But wait, let me check the options again. Oh, option E is 1 m, which is close. But wait, the calculation is about 1.14 m, which is a bit over a meter. But the options don't have 1.14 m, so E is the closest. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, wait, another thing: Did I compute m*v correctly? Let me check: 9.11e-31 kg times 1e7 m/s. 1e7 is 10^7, so 1e7 times 1e-31 is 1e-24. So 9.11e-31 *1e7 = 9.11e-24 kg·m/s. Correct.

Denominator: 1.6e-19 *5e-5 = 8e-24. Correct. So r=9.11e-24 /8e-24=1.13875. Yeah, that's right.

So the answer should be E: 1 m. But wait, looking at the options, option E is 1 m. So that's the correct choice.

The radius of the circular path of the electron beam is calculated using the formula \( r = \frac{mv}{qB} \), where \( m \) is the mass of the electron, \( v \) is its velocity, \( q \) is its charge, and \( B \) is the magnetic field strength. Substituting the given values:

- \( m = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \)
- \( v = 10^7 \, \text{m/s} \)
- \( q = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \)
- \( B = 5 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{T} \)

The numerator \( mv \) is \( (9.11 \times 10^{-31}) \times (10^7) = 9.11 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{kg·m/s} \). The denominator \( qB \) is \( (1.6 \times 10^{-19}) \times (5 \times 10^{-5}) = 8 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{C·T} \). Dividing these gives:

\[
r = \frac{9.11 \times 10^{-24}}{8 \times 10^{-24}} \approx 1.14 \, \text{m}.
\]

The closest option to this result is **E: 1 m**.
