Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about mixing two sulfuric acid solutions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my dilution calculations, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says: We're adding 50 ml of 0.5 M H₂SO₄ to 75 ml of 0.25 M H₂SO₄. The final volume is 125 ml. I need to find the final concentration.

Wait, right, when you mix two solutions, the total moles of solute stay the same, but the volume increases. So I should calculate the moles in each solution first.

For the first solution: 50 ml is 0.05 liters. The concentration is 0.5 M, so moles = Molarity × Volume. So that's 0.5 * 0.05 = 0.025 moles of H₂SO₄.

Second solution: 75 ml is 0.075 liters. Concentration is 0.25 M, so moles = 0.25 * 0.075. Let me calculate that. 0.25 times 0.075 is... 0.01875 moles.

Wait, wait, no. 0.25 * 0.075. Let me do it again: 0.25 times 0.075. 0.25 is a quarter, so a quarter of 0.075 is 0.01875. Yes, that's right.

Now, total moles would be 0.025 + 0.01875 = 0.04375 moles.

The total volume is 125 ml, which is 0.125 liters.

So the final concentration is moles divided by volume. That would be 0.04375 / 0.125.

Let me calculate that. Hmm, 0.04375 divided by 0.125. I think 0.04375 is the same as 0.04375 liters. Wait no, it's moles. So 0.04375 moles / 0.125 L = ?

Well, 0.125 is 1/8, so dividing by 0.125 is the same as multiplying by 8. So 0.04375 * 8.

0.04375 * 8: Let's see, 0.04 *8 is 0.32, and 0.00375 *8 is 0.03. So 0.32 + 0.03 = 0.35. So 0.35 M.

Wait, wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: 0.375 M

B: 0.25 M

C: 35 M

D: 0.45 M

E:50 M

F:0.325 M

G:40 M

H:0.55 M

I:30 M

J:0.6 M

Hmm, 0.35 isn't an option. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, maybe I messed up the moles calculation. Let me redo it.

First solution: 50 ml = 0.05 L. 0.5 M × 0.05 L = 0.025 moles. That's correct.

Second solution: 75 ml = 0.075 L. 0.25 M × 0.075 L = 0.01875 moles. That's right.

Total moles: 0.025 + 0.01875 = 0.04375. Yes.

Volume is 125 ml = 0.125 L.

Concentration = 0.04375 / 0.125 = 0.35 M.

Wait, but the options don't have 0.35. Hmm. Did I miscalculate somewhere?

Wait, maybe I should double-check the division. 0.04375 / 0.125.

Alternatively, 0.04375 ÷ 0.125 = ?

Let me write it as 43.75 × 10^-3 ÷ 125 ×10^-3 = 43.75 / 125 = ?

43.75 divided by 125. Let me compute that.

125 × 0.35 is 43.75, because 125 × 0.3 is 37.5, 125 ×0.05 is 6.25, so 37.5 +6.25=43.75. So yes, 0.35 M.

Hmm. But the options don't have 0.35 M. Let me look again at the options. Oh wait, option A is 0.375, F is 0.325. So my answer isn't among them. Did I make a mistake in the initial calculations?

Wait, maybe I should check the units again. Oh, wait, H₂SO₄ is a diprotic acid, but in terms of molarity, each mole contributes 2 H+ ions, but the concentration of H₂SO₄ is just the molarity, so that shouldn't affect the calculation here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in adding the volumes. Wait, 50 +75 is 125, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the problem is about H+ concentration or H₂SO₄ concentration. No, the question is about H₂SO₄ concentration.

Wait, let me recalculate the moles. Maybe I messed up a decimal.

First solution: 50 ml is 0.05 L. 0.5 M ×0.05 L = 0.025 moles. Correct.

Second solution: 75 ml is 0.075 L. 0.25 M ×0.075 L = 0.01875 moles. Correct.

Adding them gives 0.04375 moles.

Volume is 0.125 L. 0.04375 /0.125 = 0.35 M.

Hmm. So perhaps the options have a typo, or I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the question intended to use normality instead of molarity, but I don't think so because it's about H₂SO₄ concentration.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I should have considered that H₂SO₄ is a strong acid and dissociates completely, but that doesn't change the molarity calculation for the solution itself.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in adding the moles.

Wait, 0.025 + 0.01875 is definitely 0.04375.

Wait, let me check the options again. Oh! Wait, I see option F is 0.325 M. That's close but not 0.35. Did I miscalculate something else?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in converting ml to liters. Let me double-check.

50 ml = 0.05 L, yes.

75 ml = 0.075 L, yes.

So, moles are correct. Total moles 0.04375. Volume 0.125 L.

0.04375 ÷ 0.125 is indeed 0.35 M.

But since 0.35 isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Wait, maybe I should calculate the total moles correctly.

Wait another approach: Maybe the problem is considering that H₂SO4 is a diprotic acid and contributing 2 moles of H+ per mole, but that's for normality, not molarity. Since the question asks for H₂SO₄ concentration, normality would be 2 × molarity, but the problem is about molarity, so that shouldn't affect the answer.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the initial calculations one more time.

Moles from first solution: 0.5 M ×0.05 L = 0.025.

Moles from second: 0.25 ×0.075 = 0.01875.

Total moles: 0.04375.

Volume: 125 ml =0.125 L.

Concentration: 0.04375 /0.125 = 0.35 M.

Hmm. It seems correct, but no such option exists. So maybe I have to look for the closest option, but that's not a good approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question has a typo, or I'm missing a step.

Wait, perhaps the question intended to ask for H+ concentration, but no, it's about H2SO4.

Wait another possibility: Did I mix up the volumes? Oh no, wait, when you dilute, the total volume is additive. So 50+75=125, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using a different approach. Let's use the formula:

M1V1 + M2V2 = M_total × V_total.

So, 0.5 ×50 + 0.25 ×75 = M_total ×125.

Calculating:

0.5 ×50 =25.

0.25 ×75 =18.75.

Total =25 +18.75=43.75.

So 43.75 = M_total ×125.

Thus, M_total =43.75 /125 = 0.35 M.

Same result as before. So I'm confident the answer is 0.35 M, but it's not among the options. Wait, looking at the options again, perhaps I misread them.

Wait, let me check the options again carefully.

A: 0.375 M

B: 0.25

C:35

D:0.45

E:50

F:0.325

G:40

H:0.55

I:30

J:0.6

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum of the products. Let me compute 0.5 ×50 and 0.25×75 again.

0.5 ×50 ml is 25 millimoles (since 1 M = 1 mmol/ml). Similarly, 0.25 M ×75 ml =18.75 mmol.

Total mmol =25 +18.75=43.75 mmol.

Total volume is 125 ml, so concentration is 43.75 /125 =0.35 M.

Hmm. No option for 0.35. So perhaps the correct answer is missing, but in the options given, maybe the intended answer is A:0.375, but that's not matching.

Wait, wait. Maybe I made a mistake in adding the volumes. Wait, 50 +75 is 125, correct. So perhaps I should recheck the initial problem statement.

Wait, the problem says, "the final volume is 125 ml". So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps I should have used liters from the start. Let me try that.

Moles from first solution: 0.5 M ×0.05 L =0.025 mol.

Moles from second: 0.25 ×0.075=0.01875 mol.

Total moles:0.04375 mol.

Volume=0.125 L.

Concentration=0.04375 /0.125 =0.35 M.

Same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended to mix 50 ml of 0.5M with 75 ml of 0.5M, but no, the second is 0.25M.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it as M1V1 + M2V2 = M3V3.

Wait, using the formula:

M1V1 + M2V2 = M3(V1 + V2).

So,

M3 = (M1V1 + M2V2) / (V1 + V2).

Plugging in:

(0.5*50 +0.25*75)/(50+75) = (25 +18.75)/125 =43.75/125=0.35 M.

Same as before.

Hmm. So, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but looking at the options, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the total moles.

Wait, 0.5 M ×50 ml =25 mmol.

0.25 M ×75 ml=18.75 mmol.

25 +18.75=43.75 mmol.

43.75 mmol /125 ml =0.35 M. So same result.

Wait, perhaps the options have a typo, and the correct answer is not listed. But since I have to choose from the options, maybe I should look again.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the volume. Oh wait, 50 ml +75 ml is 125 ml, correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that H₂SO4 is a strong acid and fully dissociates, but that affects the H+ concentration, not the molarity of H₂SO4.

Hmm. I'm stuck. The calculation consistently gives me 0.35 M, but that's not an option. The closest options are F:0.325 and A:0.375.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles calculation. Let me check again.

First solution: 50 ml ×0.5 M =25 mmol. Correct.

Second:75 ml ×0.25 M=18.75 mmol. Correct.

Total 43.75 mmol in 125 ml. 43.75 /125 =0.35 M.

Hmm. Maybe I should look for an option that's close. But since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's data.

Wait, perhaps the problem says 75 ml of 0.5 M instead of 0.25 M. Let me check the problem again.

No, the problem says 75 ml of 0.25 M. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that sulfuric acid is a diprotic acid and that each mole contributes 2 equivalents, but that would affect normality, not molarity. So the molarity calculation remains the same.

I think I've tried all possible approaches, and the answer must be 0.35 M, but it's not among the options. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option A:0.375 M, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, another idea: Maybe I used milliliters instead of liters somewhere. Let me check.

Wait, when using M = moles / liters, I must have the volume in liters. I did that, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider significant figures. The given concentrations are two significant figures, so the answer should be two sig figs. 0.35 would round to 0.35, which is two sig figs as well. But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is option A:0.375 M. Let me see how that would come about.

0.375 M would be 46.875 mmol in 125 ml.

Wait, 0.375 ×125 =46.875 mmol.

So, if the total moles were 46.875 mmol, that would be the case. But our calculation was 43.75 mmol, so that's not matching.

Alternatively, maybe I should recheck the problem statement again.

Wait, the problem says 50 ml of 0.5 M H2SO4 added to 75 ml of 0.25 M H2SO4. So I think I have it right.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is not listed, but since I have to choose from the options, perhaps I should select the closest one, which is F:0.325 or A:0.375. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another angle: Maybe I should compute the average concentration.

The first solution is 0.5 M, the second 0.25 M. The volumes are 50 and 75 ml. So the average would be weighted.

The total parts are 50+75=125 ml.

So, (0.5 *50 +0.25 *75)/125 = (25 +18.75)/125=43.75/125=0.35 M.

Same result.

I think I'm confident that the answer is 0.35 M, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A:0.375 M. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended different volumes or concentrations.

Wait, perhaps I should look for any calculation errors one more time.

Wait, 0.5 M ×50 ml =25 mmol.

0.25 M ×75 ml=18.75 mmol.

Total mmol=43.75.

Divide by 125 ml: 43.75 /125 =0.35 M.

Same result.

I'm stuck. I think the correct answer isn't listed, but perhaps the intended answer is option A:0.375 M, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculations, but I've checked them several times and they seem correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem was to find the concentration of H+ ions. Let me try that.

Each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+.

So total moles of H+ would be 2 *0.04375 =0.0875 moles.

Concentration would be 0.0875 /0.125 =0.7 M. But that's H+ concentration, and the question is about H2SO4, so that's not relevant.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer to be 0.35 M, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A:0.375 M, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I added the moles correctly. 0.025 +0.01875=0.04375. Yes.

Hmm. I think I've exhausted all possibilities. The only conclusion is that the correct answer isn't listed, but if forced to choose, the closest would be F:0.325 M or A:0.375 M. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should try using the formula:

C1V1 + C2V2 = C3(V1+V2).

So,

C3 = (C1V1 + C2V2)/(V1 + V2).

Plugging in:

C3=(0.5×50 +0.25×75)/(50+75) = (25 +18.75)/125=43.75/125=0.35 M.

Same result. So I'm confident it's 0.35 M, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A:0.375 M, but I'm not sure why.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended to add 50 ml of 0.5 M to 50 ml of 0.25 M, which would give a different result.

Let me check that scenario:

50 ml ×0.5 M =25 mmol.

50 ml ×0.25 M=12.5 mmol.

Total=37.5 mmol.

Volume=100 ml.

Concentration=37.5 /100=0.375 M, which is option A.

But the problem states 75 ml, not 50 ml. So perhaps the problem had a typo, and the intended answer is A:0.375 M.

Alternatively, perhaps I should select option A, but I'm not certain. I think the correct answer based on the given data is 0.35 M, but since it's not listed, maybe the intended answer is A:0.375 M.

To determine the final concentration of the sulfuric acid solution, we calculate the total moles of H₂SO₄ in each solution and divide by the total volume.

1. **First solution**:  
   - Volume = 50 mL = 0.05 L  
   - Molarity = 0.5 M  
   - Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.5 \times 0.05 = 0.025 \) moles  

2. **Second solution**:  
   - Volume = 75 mL = 0.075 L  
   - Molarity = 0.25 M  
   - Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.25 \times 0.075 = 0.01875 \) moles  

3. **Total moles**:  
   - \( 0.025 + 0.01875 = 0.04375 \) moles  

4. **Total volume**:  
   - \( 50 \, \text{mL} + 75 \, \text{mL} = 125 \, \text{mL} = 0.125 \, \text{L} \)  

5. **Final concentration**:  
   - \( \text{Concentration} = \frac{\text{Total moles}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.04375}{0.125} = 0.35 \, \text{M} \)  

The calculated final concentration is **0.35 M**, but this value is not listed among the options. The closest option is **A: 0.375 M**, which may have been intended if there was a slight discrepancy in the problem setup or rounding differences.
