Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let's see what the question says. 

The question is about a generator delivering a certain amount of power and current, and we need to find the potential difference it operates at. The generator is 2.4 kilowatts and delivers 10 amperes. The options are from A to J, with various voltages listed.

Hmm, right. I remember that power in electrical terms is calculated using the formula P = V * I, where P is power, V is voltage, and I is current. So, I think I can rearrange this formula to solve for voltage since I know the power and current.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing up the units. The power is given in kilowatts, and current is in amperes. Oh, right, 1 kilowatt is 1000 watts, so 2.4 kilowatts would be 2400 watts. That makes sense because the current is 10 amperes, which is a pretty common value.

So, the formula is P = V * I. I need to find V, so rearranging it gives V = P / I. Plugging in the numbers, P is 2400 watts, and I is 10 amperes. So V equals 2400 divided by 10. Let me do that calculation: 2400 รท 10 equals 240. So the voltage should be 240 volts.

Looking at the options, option D is 240 volts. That seems straightforward. But wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Did I convert kilowatts correctly? Yes, 2.4 kW is 2400 W. Current is 10 A. So 2400 / 10 is indeed 240. So yes, D is the correct answer.

I don't think I missed anything here. The question is pretty straightforward once you remember the right formula and unit conversions. No need to worry about more complex concepts like power factors or anything else because this is a simple direct current calculation, I assume.
