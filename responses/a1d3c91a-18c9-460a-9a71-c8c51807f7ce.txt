Okay, so I need to figure out the duty cycle for a step up chopper. The input voltage is 110 V and the output voltage is 150 V. Hmm, I remember that a chopper is a device that switches a DC power supply on and off to control the average voltage applied to a load. In a step-up chopper, the output voltage is higher than the input, which means the chopper is operating in a specific mode, probably the continuous conduction mode or something else. Wait, no, I think for a step-up chopper, the output voltage is higher than the input, so the duty cycle must be less than 50% because the switch is off for a longer time than it's on. 

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting that backwards. Let me think. The duty cycle (D) is the ratio of the on-time to the total cycle time. For a step-down chopper, when the duty cycle is less than 0.5, the output voltage is less than the input. But for a step-up chopper, the output is higher, so maybe the duty cycle is less than 0.5? Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, I think I'm confusing the types. In a step-up chopper, the output voltage is higher than the input, so the average voltage is higher. How does the duty cycle relate here?

I recall the formula for the output voltage of a step-up chopper. The average voltage V_out is equal to (1/(1-D)) * V_in. Wait, wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Oh right, for a step-up chopper, the output voltage is given by V_out = V_in * (1/(1-D)). So, solving for D, we can rearrange this equation.

Given V_in = 110 V and V_out = 150 V, so plugging into the formula: 150 = 110 * (1/(1-D)). Let me solve for D.

First, divide both sides by 110: 150/110 = 1/(1-D). Let's compute 150 divided by 110. 110 goes into 150 once with 40 remaining, so 1.3636... So 1.3636 = 1/(1-D). Then, take reciprocal of both sides: 1/1.3636 â‰ˆ 0.7333 = 1 - D. So D = 1 - 0.7333 = 0.2667. Hmm, looking at the options, the closest is D: 0.27. So the duty cycle is approximately 27%, which is option D.

The duty cycle for a step-up chopper is calculated using the formula \( V_{\text{out}} = \frac{V_{\text{in}}}{1 - D} \). Rearranging for \( D \), we get \( D = 1 - \frac{V_{\text{in}}}{V_{\text{out}}} \). Substituting \( V_{\text{in}} = 110 \, \text{V} \) and \( V_{\text{out}} = 150 \, \text{V} \), we find \( D \approx 0.27 \). 

Answer: D
