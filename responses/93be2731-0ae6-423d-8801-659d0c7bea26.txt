Okay, so I have this question about labeled trees on 6 vertices, and I need to figure out how many there are. The options are from A to J, with various numbers, so I'm a bit unsure where to start. But I remember something about labeled trees and a formula related to that.

Wait, I think it's something called Cayley's formula. Yeah, Cayley's formula states that the number of labeled trees on n vertices is n^(n-2). So for n=6, that would be 6^(6-2) which is 6^4. Let me calculate that.

6^4 is 6 multiplied by itself four times. Let me break it down: 6*6 is 36, then 36*6 is 216, and 216*6 is 1296. So 6^4 equals 1296. That seems right. 

Looking back at the options, I see option I is 1296. So that must be the correct answer. But wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake with the formula or the exponent. Cayley's formula is for labeled trees, which this question is asking about, so it's applicable here. 

I also remember that when n=2, the number is 1, and using the formula 2^(0)=1, which is correct. For n=3, it's 3 trees, and 3^(1)=3, that's right too. So the formula holds for smaller numbers, which gives me more confidence.

So yeah, 6^4 is definitely 1296. The answer should be option I.

The number of labeled trees on 6 vertices is calculated using Cayley's formula, which is n^(n-2). For n=6, this is 6^4 = 1296. 

Answer: I
