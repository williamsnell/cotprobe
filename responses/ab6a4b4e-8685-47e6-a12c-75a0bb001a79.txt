Okay, so I've got this economics problem here about perfectly competitive industries and finding the short-run equilibrium price. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try my best.

Alright, the problem says there are 100 identical firms in a perfectly competitive industry. Each firm has a short-run total cost function given by C(q) = (1/300)q³ + 0.2q² + 4q + 10. The market demand is Q = -200P + 8000. I need to find the short-run equilibrium price.

Wait, in a perfectly competitive market, firms are price takers, right? So each firm's output is determined by where their marginal cost equals the market price. And the equilibrium price is where the total market supply equals the market demand.

So, the first thing I should do is find each firm's marginal cost (MC) curve. Because in the short run, firms will produce where MC equals the price (P). 

The total cost function is C(q) = (1/300)q³ + 0.2q² + 4q + 10. To get MC, I need to take the derivative of the total cost with respect to q. Let's compute that.

MC = dC/dq = (3/300)q² + 0.4q + 4. Simplifying that, 3/300 is 1/100, so MC = (1/100)q² + 0.4q + 4.

In a perfectly competitive market, each firm will supply q where MC(q) = P. So, for each firm, the supply function is q = MC inverse. Wait, but MC is a function of q, so solving for q in terms of P might be tricky because it's a quadratic equation.

Alternatively, since each firm is producing up to the point where MC = P, the industry supply is the sum of all individual supplies. But since there are 100 identical firms, the total supply Qs is 100 times each firm's supply q.

So, for each firm, at price P, the quantity supplied is q where MC(q) = P. So, q = [solution to (1/100)q² + 0.4q + 4 = P]. Let me rearrange that equation:

(1/100)q² + 0.4q + (4 - P) = 0.

Multiplying both sides by 100 to eliminate the fraction:

q² + 40q + 400 - 100P = 0.

This is a quadratic in q: q² +40q + (400 -100P)=0.

To solve for q, using quadratic formula: q = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a). Here, a=1, b=40, c=400-100P.

So discriminant D = 40² -4*1*(400-100P) = 1600 - 1600 +400P = 400P.

So q = [-40 ± sqrt(400P)] / 2.

Simplify sqrt(400P)=20sqrt(P), so q = [-40 ±20sqrt(P)] /2.

We can ignore the negative solution because quantity can't be negative. So q = (-40 +20sqrt(P))/2 = (-20 +10sqrt(P)).

Wait, that can't be right because if P is positive, 10sqrt(P) could be less than 20. Wait, let me check the calculation again.

Wait, when I have sqrt(400P)=20sqrt(P), correct. So q = [-40 + 20sqrt(P)]/2 = (-20 +10sqrt(P)). Hmm, but if P is 16, sqrt(16)=4, so 10*4=40, 40-20=20. So q=20. That seems positive.

Wait, but if P is less than 4, sqrt(P) would be less than 2, so 10sqrt(P) would be less than 20, leading to q negative. But since q can't be negative, the firm wouldn't supply anything. So the supply is q = (-20 +10sqrt(P)) when P>4, otherwise zero.

Wait, but that seems a bit odd. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the signs.

Wait, when solving for q, the quadratic equation was q² +40q + (400 -100P)=0.

So using the quadratic formula: q = [-40 ± sqrt(40² -4*1*(400-100P))]/(2*1).

Compute the discriminant again: 40²=1600; 4*1*(400-100P)=1600-400P. So D=1600 - (1600-400P) = 400P. That's correct.

So q = [-40 ± sqrt(400P)] / 2. Since sqrt(400P)=20sqrt(P), that's q = (-40 ±20sqrt(P))/2.

So positive solution: (-40 +20sqrt(P))/2 = (-20 +10sqrt(P)).

Wait, but if 10sqrt(P) is less than 20, then q becomes negative, which is impossible, so for P≥4, because sqrt(4)=2, 10*2=20, so at P=4, q=0. For P>4, q is positive.

So the supply function for each firm is q =10sqrt(P) -20, but only when P≥4. Otherwise, they supply zero.

Wait, but maybe I should think differently. Alternatively, perhaps the MC is upward sloping, so the supply curve for each firm is q = (something with sqrt(P)). But maybe it's easier to find the total supply from all 100 firms.

So total supply Qs = 100 * q = 100*(10sqrt(P) -20) ? Wait, no, because each firm's q is 10sqrt(P) -20, so 100 firms would be 100*(10sqrt(P)-20) = 1000sqrt(P) -2000.

Wait, but that can't be right because if P is 4, each firm supplies zero, so Qs=0. If P is higher, say P=9, sqrt(9)=3, so each firm would supply 10*3-20=10, so 100 firms would supply 1000.

Wait, but let me check. When P=9, each firm's MC =9. So let's compute q for each firm:

(1/100)q² +0.4q +4 =9.

Multiply by 100: q² +40q +400=900 → q² +40q -500=0.

Using quadratic formula: q = [-40 ± sqrt(1600 +2000)]/2 = [-40 ± sqrt(3600)]/2 = [-40 ±60]/2.

Positive solution: (20)/2=10. So each firm supplies 10, so 100 firms supply 1000, which matches Qs=1000sqrt(9) -2000= 1000*3 -2000=3000-2000=1000. So that seems right.

So, the total supply function is Qs=1000sqrt(P) -2000. But wait, that's valid only when P≥4, otherwise Qs=0.

Now, the market demand is given by Qd= -200P +8000.

At equilibrium, Qs=Qd. So we set 1000sqrt(P) -2000 = -200P +8000.

Let me rearrange this equation: 1000sqrt(P) +200P = 10000.

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Let me denote sqrt(P) as x. So P =x².

Substituting, equation becomes 1000x +200x² =10000.

Divide both sides by 200 to simplify: 5x +x²=50 → x² +5x -50=0.

Solving for x: x = [-5 ± sqrt(25 +200)]/2 = [-5 ± sqrt(225)]/2 = [-5 ±15]/2.

We take the positive root, so x=(10)/2=5. So sqrt(P)=5 → P=25.

Wait, that's one of the options. Option A is 25, so that's promising.

Let me check if P=25 satisfies the original equation.

Compute Qs=1000sqrt(25) -2000=1000*5 -2000=5000-2000=3000.

Compute Qd= -200*25 +8000= -5000 +8000=3000. Yep, matches. So P=25 is the equilibrium price.

Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me go through the steps again.

1. Each firm's MC is (1/100)q² +0.4q +4. Set equal to P, so (1/100)q² +0.4q +4 = P.

2. Multiply by 100: q² +40q +400 =100P → q² +40q + (400 -100P)=0.

3. Solve quadratic for q: q = [-40 ± sqrt(1600 +400P)]/2.

Wait, wait a minute, earlier I thought the discriminant was 400P, but let me check again.

Discriminant D = b² -4ac = (40)^2 -4*(1)*(400 -100P) = 1600 - (1600 -400P) = 400P. Oh, right, that's correct.

So q = [ -40 + sqrt(400P) ] / 2. Which is [ -40 + 20sqrt(P) ] / 2 = -20 +10sqrt(P).

Each firm's supply is q=10sqrt(P)-20, when P≥4.

Total supply Qs=100*(10sqrt(P)-20)=1000sqrt(P)-2000.

Set equal to Qd= -200P+8000.

So 1000sqrt(P)-2000 = -200P+8000 → 1000sqrt(P) +200P =10000.

Let x= sqrt(P), so equation becomes 1000x +200x²=10000.

Divide by 200: 5x +x²=50 → x²+5x-50=0.

Solutions: x=(-5±sqrt(25+200))/2 = (-5±15)/2. Positive solution x=5 → P=25.

Yes, that seems correct. So the equilibrium price is 25, which is option A.

To determine the short-run equilibrium price in a perfectly competitive industry with 100 identical firms, we start by analyzing the cost and demand functions.

Each firm's short-run total cost function is given as:

\[
C(q) = \frac{1}{300}q^3 + 0.2q^2 + 4q + 10
\]

The marginal cost (MC) is the derivative of the total cost with respect to \( q \):

\[
MC = \frac{dC}{dq} = \frac{1}{100}q^2 + 0.4q + 4
\]

In a perfectly competitive market, firms set \( MC = P \). For each firm, this implies:

\[
\frac{1}{100}q^2 + 0.4q + 4 = P
\]

Multiplying through by 100 to simplify:

\[
q^2 + 40q + 400 = 100P
\]

Rearranging:

\[
q^2 + 40q + (400 - 100P) = 0
\]

Solving this quadratic equation for \( q \) using the quadratic formula:

\[
q = \frac{-40 \pm \sqrt{40^2 - 4(1)(400 - 100P)}}{2(1)}
\]

Simplifying the discriminant:

\[
\sqrt{1600 - 4(400 - 100P)} = \sqrt{400P}
\]

Thus:

\[
q = \frac{-40 \pm 20\sqrt{P}}{2}
\]

Taking the positive root (since \( q \) cannot be negative):

\[
q = -20 + 10\sqrt{P}
\]

This is the supply function for each firm. Since there are 100 identical firms, the total supply \( Q_s \) is:

\[
Q_s = 100q = 100(-20 + 10\sqrt{P}) = 1000\sqrt{P} - 2000
\]

The market demand is given by:

\[
Q_d = -200P + 8000
\]

At equilibrium, \( Q_s = Q_d \):

\[
1000\sqrt{P} - 2000 = -200P + 8000
\]

Rearranging:

\[
1000\sqrt{P} + 200P = 10000
\]

Let \( x = \sqrt{P} \), so \( P = x^2 \). Substituting:

\[
1000x + 200x^2 = 10000
\]

Dividing through by 200:

\[
5x + x^2 = 50
\]

Rearranging:

\[
x^2 + 5x - 50 = 0
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{25 + 200}}{2} = \frac{-5 \pm 15}{2}
\]

Taking the positive root:

\[
x = 5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sqrt{P} = 5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad P = 25
\]

Thus, the short-run equilibrium price is **25**, which corresponds to option **A**.
