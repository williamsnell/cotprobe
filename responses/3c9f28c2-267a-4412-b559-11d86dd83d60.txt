Okay, so I've got this question about the truth table of a 3-input NAND gate. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my digital logic, but let me think this through step by step.

First, I remember that a truth table lists all possible combinations of input values and the corresponding output. For a NAND gate, I recall that it's a universal gate, meaning it can be used to create any other type of gate, but that's probably not relevant here.

The key point is the number of inputs. The question specifies a 3-input NAND gate. So, how many possible combinations of inputs are there for three binary inputs?

Each input can be either 0 or 1. Since there are three inputs, I think the number of combinations is 2 raised to the power of the number of inputs. So 2^3. Let me calculate that: 2*2*2 is 8. So there are 8 possible input combinations.

Wait, but what about the output? Oh right, each combination will have a single output value (either 0 or 1), but the question is just about the number of entries in the truth table, not the number of rows with a particular output.

So each of those 8 input combinations will be a row in the truth table. Therefore, the truth table should have 8 entries.

Looking at the options provided: A is 6, B is 12, C is 4, D is 10, E is 18, F is 9, G is 16, H is 8, I is 3, J is 7. The correct answer should be H, which is 8.

I think that's right because for n inputs, the number of entries is 2^n. So for 3 inputs, it's 8 entries. The type of gate (NAND in this case) doesn't change the number of entries; it only affects the output values.

The truth table for a 3-input NAND gate has 8 entries, as each input can be either 0 or 1, leading to 2^3 = 8 combinations.

Answer: H
