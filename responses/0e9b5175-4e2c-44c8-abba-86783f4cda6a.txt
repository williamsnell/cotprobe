Okay, so I've got this physics question about when a cannonball is fired from a cannon. The question is asking what is equal between the cannonball and the cannon. The options are A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I remember from my physics class that when two objects interact, like firing a cannonball, there are some principles that apply. Newton's third law comes to mind, which says that for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. So when the cannon fires the cannonball, the cannon must also move in the opposite direction. 

Wait, but the question is about what's equal between them. So, the force each exerts on the other should be equal and opposite. That makes me think option I: amounts of force. Because force is a vector, so the magnitude is the same, but direction is opposite. But wait, the question is asking what is experienced equally, so the magnitude of the force would be the same.

Another thing I remember is about momentum. Momentum is conserved in a closed system. So when the cannonball moves forward, the cannon must move backward to conserve momentum. That means the momentum imparted to the cannonball is equal in magnitude to the momentum the cannon gains. So option E: amounts of momentum. Because momentum is a vector too, but the magnitudes would be equal.

Wait, but the question is about what both experience. So both force and momentum are possibilities. Let me think again. The action-reaction pair is about forces. So the forces on each are equal in magnitude. But what about momentum? The total momentum of the system (cannon + cannonball) is conserved. So the changes in momentum would be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. 

So the cannon exerts a force on the cannonball, and the cannonball exerts an equal and opposite force on the cannon. Therefore, the forces are equal in magnitude. Similarly, the change in momentum for each would be the same in magnitude because force is the rate of change of momentum. So the impulse (force times time) on each would be equal and opposite, making their momentum changes equal in magnitude.

So looking at the options, both the force and the momentum changes are equal in magnitude. Let me check the options again. Option I is about force, E is about momentum.

Wait, the question says "both the cannonball and the cannon experience equal..." So which of these are they experiencing equally?

Newton's third law says the forces are equal and opposite. So the forces experienced are equal in magnitude. So option I: amounts of force. But wait, the question is about what is experienced, so both would feel the same magnitude of force.

On the other hand, momentum is a vector, but the changes are equal in magnitude. So the amount of momentum each gains is equal in magnitude, but opposite in direction. So option E: amounts of momentum.

Wait, but the question is about what is experienced. The cannon and the cannonball each gain momentum. So their changes in momentum are equal in magnitude. So E is about amounts of momentum. So both experience equal amounts of momentum change.

But wait, the cannon is much more massive, so its velocity change is smaller. But the momentum change is the same because the force and the time are the same. Wait, no, the time isn't necessarily the same. Or is it? Because the explosion is instantaneous, so the time is the same. So the impulse (force times time) is the same for both, leading to equal momentum changes.

So both experience equal amounts of momentum. So option E.

But I also thought that the forces are equal. So which is correct? The question is about what is equal. So both the force and the momentum change are equal. But looking at the options, both E and I are options.

Wait, the question is about what both experience. So both the cannon and the cannonball experience equal forces (I), and equal changes in momentum (E). So are both correct?

But looking at the options, the options are:

I: amounts of force

E: amounts of momentum

So which is the correct answer?

Wait, the question says "both the cannonball and the cannon experience equal". So the question is what is equal between them.

In the scenario, when the cannon fires the cannonball, the cannonball exerts a force on the cannon, and the cannon exerts an equal and opposite force on the cannonball. So the forces are equal in magnitude, so I: amounts of force.

Also, the change in momentum for each is equal in magnitude because FΔt = Δp. Since the force is the same and the time is the same, their momentum changes are the same. So E: amounts of momentum.

So both I and E are correct. But looking at the options, the options are given as single letters. The question is which one is correct, so perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, the options are:

A: displacements

B: Both

C: Neither

D: accelerations

E: amounts of momentum

F: amounts of potential energy

G: amounts of kinetic energy

H: velocities

I: amounts of force

J: amounts of heat energy

Wait, the options include B: Both. So if both E and I are correct, then B would be the answer. But I'm not sure if both are correct.

Wait, let's think again. The force each experiences is equal in magnitude (I). The change in momentum is equal in magnitude (E). So both I and E are correct. But the options don't have an option that combines both. Let me check the options again.

Option B is "Both". So if the question is asking what is experienced equally, and both force and momentum are experienced equally, then B would be correct. But wait, the question is about what is equal, not which options are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps only one is correct. Let me think: when the cannon fires, the cannonball experiences a force, and the cannon experiences an equal force. So the forces are equal, so I is correct. Similarly, the changes in momentum are equal because Δp = FΔt. So E is also correct.

So the question is, which of these is correct. But in the options, E and I are separate options. But the option B says "Both", but looking back at the options, does B mean both quantities (like both force and momentum) are equal, or both objects experience something.

Wait, the question is "both the cannonball and the cannon experience equal...". So, the question is asking what is equal between them. So, what is equal is either force, momentum, etc.

Wait, the correct answer is that both experience equal force and equal changes in momentum. So the question is, which of the options is correct. The options are:

I: amounts of force

E: amounts of momentum

So both are correct. But the options don't have "both E and I", so perhaps the question is designed to select the correct one.

Wait, but the options are A to J, with B being "Both". So perhaps the correct answer is that both forces and momentum are equal, so B: Both.

Wait, but the options don't specify which. So perhaps the intended answer is E: amounts of momentum, because the question is about what is experienced, and Newton's third law talks about force, but the resulting momentum change is equal.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the experience of force. So the cannon and cannonball each experience equal force, so I.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The force on the cannonball is equal and opposite to the force on the cannon. So the magnitudes are equal, so I is correct.

The change in momentum for each is equal in magnitude because the force is the same and the time is the same. So E is correct.

So both I and E are correct. But the options don't have a combined option. Wait, but the options include B: Both. So perhaps B is the correct answer, meaning both force and momentum are equal.

Wait, but the options are A-J, and the question is "both the cannonball and the cannon experience equal...". So the answer is that they experience equal amounts of force (I) and equal changes in momentum (E). Since both I and E are correct, but the options don't have both, perhaps the intended answer is E: amounts of momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the forces being equal, so I is correct.

Wait, let me think about the question again. It says, "both the cannonball and the cannon experience equal...". So what is equal? The forces they exert on each other are equal in magnitude, so I is correct. The changes in momentum are equal, so E is correct.

But looking at the options, the possible answers are individual options. So the correct answers are both I and E, but since the options don't have a 'both', perhaps the intended answer is E.

Wait, but let me think about the actual physics. When the cannon fires, the explosion applies a force to the cannonball, and an equal and opposite force to the cannon. So the forces are equal in magnitude (I). Additionally, the impulse (force × time) is the same for both, so the change in momentum is the same (E). Therefore, both I and E are correct.

But the options don't have an option that says both. So perhaps the question is designed to have one correct answer. Let me check the options again.

Option B is "Both", which I think refers to both the cannon and the cannonball experiencing both force and momentum changes. Wait, no, the options are singular. Option B is "Both", but in the context, it's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the forces being equal, so the answer is I.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to recall the exact question. The question is, what is equal between the cannonball and the cannon when fired. The options are about what they experience equally.

The correct answer is that both experience equal forces and equal changes in momentum. But since the options don't allow for both, perhaps the intended answer is E: amounts of momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is testing the knowledge that the forces are equal, so I is correct.

Wait, but the question is about what they experience. So both the cannonball and the cannon each experience a force. The forces are equal in magnitude, so I is correct. The changes in momentum are equal in magnitude, so E is correct.

Since both I and E are correct, but the options don't allow for that, perhaps the correct answer is E because it's about the result of the force, which is the momentum change.

But I'm not entirely sure. I think I'm overcomplicating this. The correct answers are both I and E, but since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is E: amounts of momentum.

Wait, no, I think the correct answer is E. Because when the cannon fires, the cannonball gains momentum in one direction, and the cannon gains an equal amount in the opposite direction. So the amounts of momentum are equal in magnitude.

But wait, the question is about what they experience. So each experiences a change in momentum equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So the amounts of momentum change are equal, making E correct.

Yes, I think the answer is E: amounts of momentum.

When a cannonball is fired from a cannon, both the cannonball and the cannon experience equal changes in momentum. According to Newton's third law, the forces they exert on each other are equal in magnitude, and the impulse (force × time) is the same for both, leading to equal changes in momentum. Therefore, the correct answer is:

E: amounts of momentum
