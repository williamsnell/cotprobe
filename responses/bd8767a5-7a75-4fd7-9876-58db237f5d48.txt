Question:

A disadvantage of the contention approach for LANs, such as CSMA/CD, is the capacity wasted due to multiple stations attempting to access the channel at the same time. Suppose that time is divided into discrete slots, with each of 5 stations attempting to transmit with probability 0.35 during each slot. What fraction of slots is wasted due to multiple simultaneous transmission attempts?

Options:

A: 0.465
B: 0.654
C: 0.572
D: 0.743
E: 0.501
F: 0.217
G: 0.599
H: 0.389
I: 0.125
J: 0.308

Okay, so I've got this question about the contention approach in LANs, specifically using CSMA/CD. The question is asking about the fraction of slots wasted due to multiple stations trying to transmit at the same time. Hmm, I remember that in CSMA/CD, stations wait for the channel to be idle before transmitting, but sometimes they still collide. 

Wait, the problem says time is divided into discrete slots. Each of 5 stations attempts to transmit with a probability of 0.35 during each slot. So I need to find out how often more than one station tries to transmit at the same time, which causes the collision and thus the slot is wasted.

So first, I think I should model this as a probability problem. Each station independently has a 0.35 chance of transmitting in a slot. The number of stations is 5. 

The wasted slots happen when two or more stations transmit simultaneously. So the fraction wasted is the probability that two or more stations transmit in the same slot.

To find this, I can calculate the probability of 0 or 1 stations transmitting, and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability of 2 or more, which is the fraction wasted.

Let me think about the formula. The probability that exactly k stations transmit in a slot follows a binomial distribution. The formula is P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k), where n is the number of trials (stations), p is the probability of success (transmitting), and C(n,k) is the combination.

So, for 0 stations transmitting: P(0) = C(5,0) * (0.35)^0 * (0.65)^5. Since C(5,0) is 1, (0.35)^0 is 1, so P(0) = (0.65)^5.

Calculating that: 0.65^5. Let me compute that step by step. 0.65*0.65 is 0.4225. Then 0.4225 *0.65 is approximately 0.2746. Then 0.2746 *0.65 is about 0.1785, and then *0.65 again is around 0.116. So P(0) ≈ 0.116.

Next, P(1) = C(5,1) * (0.35)^1 * (0.65)^4. C(5,1) is 5. So 5 * 0.35 * (0.65)^4.

Calculate (0.65)^4: 0.65^2 is 0.4225, squared is about 0.1785. So 5 * 0.35 * 0.1785. Let me compute: 5 *0.35 is 1.75, times 0.1785. 1.75 *0.1785 ≈ 0.312375.

So P(1)≈0.312375.

Now, the total P(0 or 1) is 0.116 + 0.312375 = 0.428375.

Therefore, the fraction wasted is 1 - 0.428375 = 0.571625. Looking at the options, option C is 0.572, which is very close. So the answer should be C.

The fraction of slots wasted due to multiple simultaneous transmission attempts is approximately 0.572.
