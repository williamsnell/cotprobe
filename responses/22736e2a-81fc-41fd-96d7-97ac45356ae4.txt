Question:

On May 19, a telephone operator for the local telephone company received a call in which a male voice said: "I want to report that the downtown sporting arena is going to be blown up tonight. " The caller then hung up. The line on which the call was made was a line owned by a woman. Immediately after receiving the call, the telephone operator reported the threatening conversation to the police. About half an hour later, during which time she had handled a number of other calls, the telephone operator received a call from a police officer who was at the woman's home. He asked her to listen to a voice. After she did, the officer asked the telephone operator if she could identify it. The telephone operator responded that she was positive that it was the voice of the person who had made the threat. As a result of the telephone operator's identification, the woman's boyfriend was arrested and charged with the crime of terrorist threatening. As a consequence of the arrest, the boyfriend lost his job and suffered embarrassment and ridicule in the community. At trial, however, the telephone operator's identification proved to be erroneous, and the boyfriend was exonerated. In a defamation action for slander by the boyfriend against the telephone operator and the telephone company, he will most likely

Options:

A: not succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification was protected by a qualified privilege for statements made in the public interest.
B: not succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification was made without actual malice.
C: not succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification was a simple mistake.
D: succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification resulted in financial harm.
E: succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification constituted slander per Se.
F: succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification resulted in the loss of his good reputation in the community.
G: succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification was a reckless disregard for the truth.
H: succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification resulted in public humiliation.
I: not succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification was made in the course of her employment.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about defamation. Let me read through the scenario carefully.

So, on May 19, a telephone operator got a call from a man who threatened to blow up the downtown sporting arena. The operator reported this to the police. Later, a police officer called her and had her listen to a voice, which she identified as the same person who made the threat. Because of her identification, the woman's boyfriend was arrested. But later, at trial, her identification was wrong, and he was exonerated. Now, he's suing for slander, and we need to see if he'll succeed.

The options are A through I, each giving a reason why he might or might not win. Let's break down the elements of slander. Slander is a form of defamation that's spoken, as opposed to written (libel). To win a slander case, the plaintiff usually needs to prove that the defendant made a false statement, published it (communicated it to someone else), acted with a certain level of intent (like negligence or malice), and that the statement caused harm.

Now, in this case, the telephone operator made an identification based on a voice she recognized. But she was wrong, leading to the boyfriend's arrest and the resulting damages. But defamation requires that the statement be false and defamatory. Here, the statement was her identification of the voice as the threatener, which led to the arrest.

Wait, but in defamation law, certain statements are considered slander per se, which are so obviously harmful that damages are presumed. Examples include accusing someone of a crime, having a loathsome disease, or affecting their professional reputation. If the operator's statement falls into this category, the plaintiff might not need to prove actual damages beyond a certain point.

But here, the operator's statement was her belief that the voice was the one who made the threat. The police officer was investigating, so she was aiding law enforcement. Now, in defamation, there's the concept of qualified privilege. Qualified privilege protects statements made in good faith on a subject in which the public has an interest, like in legal proceedings or public matters. If the statement is made without malice and is related to a public concern, it might be privileged.

So, the operator was working with the police, helping them identify a potential threat. Her identification was made in the course of her job, which is a public interest matter. If she acted without malice (i.e., without knowing it was false or with reckless disregard for the truth), then her statement might be protected under qualified privilege.

Looking at the options:

A says she's protected by qualified privilege because it's in the public interest. That sounds plausible because she was assisting the police in a potentially dangerous situation, which is a matter of public concern.

B says she's protected because she didn't have actual malice. Actual malice is more about knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard, which would be a higher threshold. If she made a mistake without reckless disregard, then B could apply, but qualified privilege might offer broader protection.

C says it's a simple mistake. But mistakes, even if they're errors, don't necessarily make the statement protected unless other factors, like privilege, apply.

D says he succeeds because of financial harm. But slander requires more than just harm; the statement must be defamatory. Also, if it's privileged, the harm doesn't negate the privilege.

E says it's slander per se. The statement was an accusation of a crime (terrorism), which is slander per se. But if it's protected by qualified privilege, that defense could override the slander per se argument.

F mentions loss of good reputation. That's a form of harm, but again, if the statement is privileged, that might not matter.

G says she acted with reckless disregard. If that's the case, then qualified privilege might not apply because malice would negate the privilege. But the question says she was mistaken, not that she acted with malice.

H mentions public humiliation, but again, if the statement is privileged, that could be a defense.

I says she was acting in the course of employment, which might tie into whether she had a duty to make such statements, possibly invoking qualified privilege.

So, the key here is whether the statement is protected by qualified privilege. Since she was assisting law enforcement in a matter of public safety, her identification likely falls under qualified privilege. For qualified privilege to apply, she must not have acted with actual malice. The question says she was mistaken but doesn't indicate she acted with malice. Therefore, her identification was made in good faith, and the privilege applies.

Looking at the options, A says not to succeed because of qualified privilege for public interest. B says not to succeed because no actual malice. Both A and B could be correct, but A seems broader because it's about the privilege due to public interest, which is a stronger defense.

Wait, but in some jurisdictions, qualified privilege requires that the statement be made without malice. So if she was mistaken but not malicious, then B's reasoning could also be correct. But A's reasoning is about the public interest, which is another basis for qualified privilege.

Hmm. I think A is the better answer because it directly addresses the public interest aspect, which is a classic example of qualified privilege. She was aiding law enforcement in a public matter, so her statement is protected. Therefore, the boyfriend's defamation claim would not succeed because of qualified privilege.

The scenario involves a defamation claim where the telephone operator's erroneous identification led to the boyfriend's arrest and subsequent harm. The key issue is whether the operator's statement is protected by qualified privilege. Qualified privilege applies to statements made in good faith on matters of public interest, such as assisting law enforcement in a potential terrorist threat. Since the operator acted without malice and her statement was related to a public concern, her identification is protected under qualified privilege. Therefore, the boyfriend's defamation claim is unlikely to succeed.
