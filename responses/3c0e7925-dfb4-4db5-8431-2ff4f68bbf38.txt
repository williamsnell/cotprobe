Okay, let me try to work through this problem. I'm a bit new to machine learning, but I'll do my best.

So, the question has two statements, and I need to evaluate each as true or false. Then, choose the correct option from A to J based on that.

Let's start with Statement 1: After mapping into feature space Q through a radial basis kernel function, 1-NN using unweighted Euclidean distance may be able to achieve better classification performance than in the original space. Hmm, I remember that kernel functions are used to map data into a higher-dimensional space where it might be easier to find a separating hyperplane. Radial basis functions, like RBF kernels, are known for creating a non-linear decision boundary in the original space by mapping data into a higher-dimensional space.

1-NN, or nearest neighbor classification, works by finding the nearest labeled example to the query point and using its label. In the original space, the Euclidean distance might not capture the necessary structure because the data might be non-linearly separable. By mapping to a higher-dimensional space (via the kernel), the distances between points could better reflect the underlying structure, allowing 1-NN to find more accurate neighbors. So, it's possible that the classification performance improves. But the statement says "may be able," which means it's not guaranteed. I think this makes Statement 1 true.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Sometimes, the kernel trick can introduce more complexity, and maybe Euclidean distance in the transformed space isn't always better. But I think the general idea is that it can lead to better performance, so I'll tentatively say Statement 1 is true.

Now, Statement 2: The VC dimension of a Perceptron is smaller than that of a simple linear SVM. I remember that VC dimension is a measure of the capacity of a model. A Perceptron is a linear classifier, similar to an SVM. However, the key difference is that SVM uses a soft margin, allowing for some misclassifications, while Perceptron is a hard-margin method. 

Wait, but in the case of a linear SVM, the VC dimension is related to the number of support vectors. I think that the Perceptron and linear SVM have the same VC dimension because they are both linear models. The VC dimension for a linear classifier in d-dimensional space is d+1. Oh wait, but wait: no, the VC dimension for a Perceptron is actually the same as for a linear SVM because they both are linear in the feature space. So, perhaps their VC dimensions are the same. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the VC dimension of a Perceptron is equal to its number of parameters plus one. For a linear model, the number of parameters is the number of features plus the bias term. So, for a linear Perceptron in d dimensions, the VC is d+1. Similarly, a linear SVM also has a VC dimension of d+1. So, their VC dimensions are the same. But wait, that's not correct—because the linear SVM's VC dimension actually depends on the margin and the data, but generally, for linear classifiers, the VC dimension is the same as the number of parameters. So, if both have the same number of parameters, their VC dimensions are the same. Therefore, Statement 2 is false because it says the Perceptron's VC is smaller than the linear SVM's. So, Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Some sources say that the Perceptron has a VC dimension of O(d), similar to linear SVM. So, perhaps they have the same VC dimension. If that's the case, then Statement 2 is false because it claims the Perceptron's VC is smaller, which isn't true. So, Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but another thought: the Perceptron is a hard-margin classifier, whereas the SVM is a soft-margin. Does that affect VC dimension? I think VC dimension is more about the capacity to shatter data, regardless of margins. Since both are linear, their VC dimensions would be the same. So, Statement 2 is false.

So, putting it together: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false. Therefore, the correct option would be F: True, True? Wait, no—wait, no, because Statement 2 is false. So, looking at the options:

A: Partly True, Partly False → No, because Statement 1 is true, 2 is false. So, first is true, second is false.

Looking at the options:

C: True, False → That would be correct if Statement 1 is true and 2 is false. So, the answer would be option C.

Wait, but earlier I thought Statement 1 is true. Let me double-check Statement 1.

Statement 1: Using 1-NN with RBF kernel might achieve better performance. RBF kernel maps data into a higher space, and in that space, the Euclidean distance could capture more intricate relationships. So, 1-NN in the transformed space might indeed perform better, so Statement 1 is true. Therefore, option C is correct: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false.
</think>

The first statement is true because mapping data into a higher-dimensional space using a radial basis kernel can improve the performance of 1-NN by allowing the Euclidean distance to capture more complex relationships. The second statement is false because the VC dimension of a Perceptron and a linear SVM are the same, as both are linear classifiers with the same capacity.

Answer: C
