Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about group theory, specifically about free abelian groups and torsion-free abelian groups. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has two statements:

Statement 1: Every free abelian group is torsion-free.
Statement 2: Every finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is a free abelian group.

And I need to evaluate the truthfulness of each statement and choose the correct option from A to J.

Let me start by recalling some definitions to make sure I'm on the right track.

A free abelian group is a group that is isomorphic to a direct sum of copies of the integers. It has a basis, like a vector space, where every element can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of basis elements with integer coefficients.

A torsion-free abelian group is one where the only element with finite order (torsion) is the identity element. So, no element other than the identity has a finite order. That means, for any element g in the group and any non-zero integer n, n*g ≠ identity.

Now, let's tackle Statement 1: Every free abelian group is torsion-free.

Hmm. Well, a free abelian group is built from copies of Z, the integers. The integers under addition are certainly torsion-free because the only element with finite order is 0. If you take a direct sum of such groups, each component is torsion-free, and the direct sum of torsion-free groups is torsion-free. Because if any component had torsion, the element in the direct sum would have torsion too. So, yes, every free abelian group can't have any torsion elements. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.

Now, Statement 2: Every finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is a free abelian group.

Wait, I remember something about this. For abelian groups, I think there's a theorem called the Structure Theorem for Finitely Generated Abelian Groups. It states that every finitely generated abelian group is a direct sum of cyclic groups. If the group is torsion-free, then none of these cyclic groups can have finite order, so each must be isomorphic to Z. Therefore, the group is free abelian.

Wait, but is that always the case? Let me think. If a finitely generated abelian group is torsion-free, then yes, it should be free. Because in the structure theorem, the decomposition includes a torsion part and a torsion-free part. Since our group has no torsion, the torsion part is trivial, so the group is the direct sum of copies of Z, which makes it free abelian. So Statement 2 is also true.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me check an example. Take Z^n, which is free abelian and finitely generated. It's obviously torsion-free. What about a group like Z × Z × ... × Z (finite times)? Yeah, those are free abelian. Now, what about a non-finitely generated torsion-free abelian group? Like Q, the rationals under addition. Q is torsion-free, but it's not free abelian because it's divisible (every element has a multiple that maps to any other element). But wait, the question is about finitely generated groups. So for finitely generated, the structure theorem applies, and they must be free.

So both statements are true. So looking at the options, option I is "True, True." So the answer should be I.

Both statements are true.
