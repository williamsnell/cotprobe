Okay, so I need to figure out which leader is known for spreading the dharma of non-violence. The options are A through G, and the choices include Ashoka, Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King Jr., Ngo Dinh Diem, Adolf Hitler, Vladimir Putin, Mother Teresa, and Siddhartha.

First, I should understand what the question is asking. The term "dharma" comes from Sanskrit and often refers to the teachings or principles of a religion, particularly in Hinduism and Buddhism. Non-violence, or ahimsa, is a key principle in these teachings. So the question is asking which leader is known for spreading the teachings of non-violence.

Looking at the options:

A: Ashoka. I remember Ashoka was an ancient Indian emperor who is famous for spreading Buddhism after converting to it. He's known for his policy of non-violence and promoting peace, so this seems like a strong candidate.

B: Nelson Mandela. He was a South African leader who fought against apartheid. He was a proponent of non-violent resistance, especially in his early years. However, later on, he supported the armed wing of the ANC. So while he did a lot for non-violence, it's not clear if he's the best fit for the question.

C: Martin Luther King Jr. He's a well-known civil rights leader who was a strong advocate for non-violent civil disobedience. He was inspired by Gandhi's teachings and used non-violent methods to fight for civil rights in the US. This is a strong contender.

D: Ngo Dinh Diem. He was the president of South Vietnam and is known for his opposition to communism. He wasn't really associated with non-violence; instead, his regime was quite repressive.

E: Adolf Hitler. Clearly not, as he was responsible for World War II and the Holocaust, which involved massive violence.

F: Vladimir Putin. He's the current Russian president, known for his strong leadership and policies that are often criticized, but not particularly for non-violence.

G: Mother Teresa. She was a Catholic nun who worked for the poor in India and was known for her compassion and peace efforts. While she promoted peace, she wasn't a political leader spreading dharma per se.

H: Siddhartha. That's Siddhartha Gautama, the founder of Buddhism. He taught the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path, which includes non-violence. But the question is about a leader, and Siddhartha was a spiritual leader, not a political one.

So, the main contenders seem to be Ashoka, Mandela, and Martin Luther King Jr. Ashoka is associated with spreading Buddhism and non-violence in his empire. Mandela used non-violent methods but also supported armed struggle. MLK Jr. is a quintessential example of non-violent activism.

The question specifies "spreading the dharma of non-violence." Dharma here likely refers to the teachings, so Ashoka is spreading the dharma through his policies and promotion of Buddhism. MLK Jr. was spreading the principles in a different context, but his methods were non-violent.

Wait, but the question is about a leader known for spreading the dharma, so perhaps it's looking for someone who propagated the teachings. Ashoka, as a ruler, built stupas and promoted Buddhist teachings, which include non-violence. Mandela and MLK were more about applying non-violence in their struggles.

So, the answer is likely A: Ashoka.
