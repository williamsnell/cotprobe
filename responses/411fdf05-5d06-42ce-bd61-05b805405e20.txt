Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a box on an inclined plane. The question is about what happens to the normal force as the angle of the plane increases. Hmm, I remember that when an object is on an incline, the forces involved change based on the angle. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I recall that the normal force is the force exerted by a surface to support the weight of an object resting on it. On a flat, horizontal surface, the normal force equals the weight of the object because there's no component of the weight pushing into the surface at an angle. But when the surface is inclined, things change.

When the box is on the inclined plane, the gravitational force (which is the weight) acts downward. This force can be broken down into two components: one parallel to the incline and one perpendicular to it. The component perpendicular to the incline is what affects the normal force.

So, let's visualize this. The box's weight, mg, is the force due to gravity. If the angle of the incline is θ, then the component of the weight perpendicular to the incline is mg cosθ. That's because cosθ is the adjacent side in the right triangle formed by the weight, the normal force, and the angle. The component parallel to the incline is mg sinθ, but that's not directly relevant to the normal force.

Wait, but wait a second. The normal force (N) is equal to the component of the weight perpendicular to the incline. So N = mg cosθ. That makes sense because as the angle θ increases, the cosθ decreases. Because cosine of an angle decreases as the angle increases from 0 to 90 degrees. For example, cos0 is 1, cos30 is about 0.866, cos60 is 0.5, and so on.

So, as θ increases, cosθ decreases, which means the normal force N = mg cosθ also decreases. Now, the question is asking about how the normal force changes as the angle increases. So, it's a matter of how cosθ behaves as θ increases.

Looking at the options:

A: oscillates between increasing and decreasing — No, that's not right. The angle is increasing steadily, so cosθ just decreases monotonically.

B: decreases linearly — Hmm, cosθ doesn't decrease linearly with θ. The relationship between cosθ and θ is nonlinear because cosθ is a trigonometric function, which isn't linear.

C: first increases, then decreases — No, because as θ increases from 0 to 90 degrees, cosθ just decreases without any increase.

D: decreases exponentially — Exponential decrease would be something like e^(-kθ), but cosθ decreases in a cosine manner, not exponentially.

E: decreases nonlinearly — Yes, because the decrease is due to the cosine function, which is nonlinear. So this seems correct.

F: remains constant until a certain angle, then decreases linearly — No, the normal force starts to decrease immediately as the angle increases from zero.

G: increases linearly — No, because as θ increases, N decreases.

H: increases exponentially — Also incorrect.

I: increases nonlinearly — No, because N is decreasing, not increasing.

J: does not change — Definitely not, because as the angle increases, N does change.

So the correct answer should be E: decreases nonlinearly.

Wait, but let me double-check. The normal force N = mg cosθ. As θ increases, cosθ decreases. The rate at which cosθ decreases isn't linear—it's based on the cosine function, which has a derivative involving negative sine, so the rate of change isn't constant. Therefore, the normal force decreases in a nonlinear way. So yes, E is the right answer.
</think>

The normal force on a box sitting on an inclined plane is given by \( N = mg \cos\theta \), where \( \theta \) is the angle of the incline. As \( \theta \) increases, the cosine function decreases, and this decrease is nonlinear because the cosine function's rate of change is not constant. This nonlinear decrease is due to the nature of the trigonometric cosine function, which does not change linearly with \( \theta \). Therefore, the normal force decreases nonlinearly as the angle of the plane increases.

Answer: E
