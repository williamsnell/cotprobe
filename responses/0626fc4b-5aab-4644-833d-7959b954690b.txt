Question:

Connie Computer decided to purchase a $1,000 laptop computer to use during law school. When she went into Computer Retailer Inc., the salesperson also sold her a 5-year service agreement for $1,200 for a total price of $2,200. Nine months later, the laptop stopped working and Computer Retailer refused to perform on their service agreement. If Connie sues Computer Retailer, the trial court will likely find for

Options:

A: Computer Retailer, under the UCC unless the predominate reason for entering into the contract was for the service portion of the contract.
B: Connie, under the UCC unless the predominate purpose of the agreement was for the service agreement portion of the contract.
C: Connie, under the common law unless the predominate reason for entering into the contract was for the service portion of the contract.
D: Computer Retailer, only if the court determines that the predominate purpose of the contract was for the goods portion of the contract.
E: Connie, under the common law because the predominate purpose for which the parties contracted was the sale of goods.
F: Computer Retailer, if the court determines that the predominate purpose of the agreement is determined by intent and not the relative dollars assigned to the computer and the service agreement.
G: Connie, under the UCC only if the predominate reason for entering into the contract was for the goods portion of the contract.
H: Computer Retailer, under the common law if the court determines that the predominate purpose of the agreement was for the service agreement portion of the contract.
I: Connie, if the court determines that the predominate purpose of the agreement is determined by the relative dollars assigned to the computer and the service agreement.
J: Computer Retailer, if the court determines that the service agreement was not a significant part of the contract.

Alright, let's try to figure out this question. So, Connie bought a laptop for $1,000 and also a 5-year service agreement for $1,200, making the total $2,200. Then, after nine months, the laptop broke, and the retailer refused to honor the service agreement. Connie is suing, and we need to determine who the trial court will likely rule in favor of.

First, I remember that contracts can be governed by either the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) or common law, depending on the type of goods involved. The UCC applies to the sale of goods, whereas common law applies to services.

In this case, the main issue is whether the contract is for the sale of goods or a service. Connie bought a laptop, which is a good, but she also purchased a service agreement. So, the contract has both elements—goods and services.

I think the key here is determining the predominant purpose of the contract. If the primary reason for the contract was the sale of the laptop (a good), then the UCC would apply. If it was mainly for the service, then common law would apply.

Looking at the amounts, the laptop was $1,000 and the service was $1,200. So, the service is more expensive. But does that mean it's the predominant purpose? Maybe, but sometimes it's about the intent rather than just the money.

I recall that under the UCC, a contract that includes both goods and services is treated as a goods contract if the primary purpose is the goods. Conversely, if the primary purpose is the services, it's governed by common law.

So, if the court decides that the predominant purpose was the service agreement, then Connie would sue under common law. If it was the laptop, then under UCC.

Looking at the options:

Option B says Connie under UCC unless the predominant purpose was the service. That doesn't seem right because if the purpose was service, common law would apply.

Option E says Connie under common law because the predominant purpose was goods. Wait, no, E says because it was goods, so that would mean UCC applies, not common law.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

If the predominant purpose is the goods, UCC applies. If it's the service, common law applies.

In the question, Connie bought both. The service is more expensive, but the main thing is the laptop. Or does the service being more expensive make it the predominant purpose?

Wait, the UCC applies to the sale of goods. The service agreement is a separate contract or part of the same? I think when goods and services are part of the same contract, the UCC still applies if the goods are the primary focus.

But I might be mixing this up. Another approach: the UCC (Article 2) applies to sales of goods. So, the sale of the laptop is under UCC. The service agreement is a separate contract, perhaps governed by common law.

But in this case, the service agreement is part of the same transaction. So, the entire contract includes both. Under UCC § 2-201, a contract for the sale of goods can include terms that relate to services, but the overall contract's predominant purpose determines the governing law.

So, if the predominant purpose is the sale of goods, UCC applies. If it's the service, common law.

In this scenario, the service is more expensive, so maybe the court would consider that the predominant purpose was the service. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the intent of the parties might matter more than the price.

If the court determines the predominant purpose was the laptop (goods), then Connie can sue under UCC and win if the retailer breached. But if the court finds the service was predominant, then common law applies, and maybe the retailer isn't obligated to perform as under UCC.

Wait, but the question is about who the court will likely find for. Connie is suing, claiming that the retailer breached the service agreement.

If the contract is governed by UCC, then the sale of goods (laptop) is under UCC, but the service agreement might be considered a separate contract. However, if the service agreement is part of the same contract, then perhaps the entire agreement is under UCC if the goods are predominant.

Alternatively, the service agreement might be considered a contract for services, thus common law.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option B: Connie under UCC unless the predominant purpose was the service. That would mean if service was predominant, Connie can't sue under UCC. But the question is about whether the court will find for Connie or the retailer.

Wait, the retailer refused to perform the service. So, if the contract is under UCC, does that affect the service part? Or is the service governed by common law?

I think the UCC doesn't cover the service part. So, if the predominant purpose was the goods, the sale is under UCC, but the service is under common law. So, Connie would sue under common law for breach of the service agreement.

But the options don't directly say that. Let me check each option.

Option E: Connie under common law because the predominant purpose was the sale of goods. That seems off because if goods were predominant, the sale is UCC, but the service is separate.

Option B: Connie under UCC unless the predominant purpose was service. So, if the predominant purpose was service, she can't sue under UCC, but perhaps under common law.

Wait, but the question is about which party the court will find for. If the contract is under UCC, then the sale is valid, but the service is separate. If the service was part of the contract, then perhaps the UCC would apply only to the goods.

Alternatively, maybe the entire contract is under UCC if the goods are predominant.

I'm getting a bit confused, but I think the key is whether the contract is considered a sale of goods or a service contract.

If the predominant purpose is the goods, UCC applies, and Connie can sue under UCC for breach of the service part? Or maybe the service is a separate contract under common law.

Wait, no, the service agreement is part of the same contract. So, the entire consideration includes both goods and services.

In that case, the UCC would apply if the predominant purpose is the goods. So, the sale of the laptop is under UCC, but the service agreement is a separate part, perhaps under common law.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: if the contract is for both goods and services, the UCC applies if the primary reason was for the goods. So, Connie's claim for the service would be under common law.

So, if the court determines that the predominant purpose was the goods (laptop), then the sale is under UCC, but the service agreement is a separate contract under common law. Therefore, Connie can sue for breach of the service under common law.

Looking back at the options, which ones talk about common law?

Option E says Connie under common law because the predominant purpose was goods. That seems contradictory because if the predominant purpose was goods, the sale is UCC, but the service could be separate.

Wait, no. If the predominant purpose is goods, the entire contract is governed by UCC. But services are typically not covered by UCC. So, perhaps the service agreement is a separate contract under common law.

But the question is about the trial court's ruling. So, if the contract is for both goods and services, and if the predominant purpose is the goods, then the sale is under UCC, but the service agreement is under common law.

In that case, Connie can sue under common law for breach of the service agreement.

Looking at the options, option E says Connie under common law because the predominant purpose was goods. That might not make sense because the predominant purpose was goods, so the sale is UCC, but the service is separate. Alternatively, perhaps the entire contract is under UCC, but the service part isn't enforceable under UCC.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me think again. Under UCC, a contract can include both goods and services if the goods are the predominant factor. So, the entire contract would be under UCC, and the service part would be considered part of the goods contract.

But the UCC doesn't regulate services; it regulates the sale of goods. So, the service agreement might be considered a separate contract.

Alternatively, if the service is a part of the goods contract, then the UCC would apply to the entire agreement, including the service terms.

But I'm not certain. Another approach: the UCC applies to the sale of goods, so the sale of the laptop is under UCC. The service agreement is a separate contract, which would be under common law. Therefore, if the retailer breached the service agreement, Connie would sue under common law.

But looking at the options, which ones talk about common law and the outcome.

Option B: Connie under UCC unless the predominant purpose was the service.

Option E: Connie under common law because the predominant purpose was goods.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. If the predominant purpose was goods, the sale is UCC, but the service is separate. So, Connie's claim for the service would be under common law.

But the options don't seem to directly state that. Alternatively, perhaps the entire contract is governed by UCC if the goods are predominant, so Connie can sue under UCC for the service part as well.

But I'm not sure about that. Maybe the service agreement is considered a separate contract, so the UCC doesn't apply to it.

In that case, if the predominant purpose was goods, the sale is UCC, and the service is a separate common law contract. So, Connie would sue under common law for breach of the service.

Looking at the options, option E says Connie under common law because the predominant purpose was goods. That might be correct because if the goods were predominant, the sale is UCC, but the service is a separate contract under common law, allowing Connie to sue under common law.

Alternatively, perhaps the entire contract is under UCC, so the service is part of it, and Connie can sue under UCC for the service. But I'm not sure if UCC covers the service part.

Wait, no. The UCC governs the sale of goods, not the provision of services. So, the service agreement is a separate contract under common law.

Therefore, if the predominant purpose was the goods, then the sale is UCC, and the service agreement is under common law. So, Connie would have a claim under common law for breach of the service agreement.

Looking at the options, option E says Connie under common law because the predominant purpose was goods. That would make sense because the sale (goods) is UCC, and the service is common law. So, Connie can sue under common law for the service.

But I'm not 100% certain. Another option is option B: Connie under UCC unless the predominant purpose was the service.

Alternatively, perhaps the entire contract is considered as a service contract if the service is the predominant purpose. So, if the court finds that the service was the predominant purpose, then the contract is under common law, and Connie can sue under common law. If the goods were predominant, under UCC.

Wait, but the question is about who the court will find for. If the contract is under UCC, then the sale is enforceable, but the service is a separate contract. If the service is the predominant purpose, then the contract is under common law, and Connie can sue for breach.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for the correct answer based on what I know.

I think the key is that when a contract includes both goods and services, the UCC applies if the predominant purpose is the goods. If the service is predominant, common law applies.

In this case, the service is more expensive, but the question is about the predominant purpose. If the court finds that the predominant purpose was the service, then the contract is under common law, and Connie can sue under common law.

Looking at the options, option B says Connie under UCC unless the predominant purpose was service. So, if the purpose was service, she can't sue under UCC but under common law.

But the question is about the outcome. If the court determines that the predominant purpose was the goods, then UCC applies, and Connie can sue under UCC. If it was service, common law.

But the problem is, the retailer refused to perform the service. So, if the contract is under UCC, does that affect the service? Or is the service a separate contract.

I think the service agreement is a separate contract. So, if the sale of goods is under UCC, the service would be under common law. Therefore, Connie can sue under common law for breach of the service agreement.

But I'm not sure which option that corresponds to.

Looking at the options again:

Option E: Connie under common law because the predominant purpose for which the parties contracted was the sale of goods.

Hmm, that seems contradictory. If the predominant purpose was goods, then the sale is UCC, but the service is a separate contract under common law. So, Connie can sue under common law for the service.

So, option E might be correct. Or maybe option B.

Wait, option B says Connie under UCC unless the predominant purpose was the service. So, if the predominant purpose was service, she can't sue under UCC but under common law.

The question is about who the court will find for. If the contract is under UCC, Connie can recover for the goods but not necessarily the service. But the service is a separate contract under common law.

I'm still a bit confused. Maybe the correct answer is E, because if the predominant purpose was goods, the sale is under UCC, and the service is a separate contract under common law, so she can sue under common law.

Alternatively, the entire contract is under UCC if the goods are predominant, so the service is part of the UCC contract, but I'm not sure if UCC applies to service parts.

I think the better approach is that the UCC applies to the sale of goods, and the service agreement is a separate contract under common law. Therefore, if the court finds that the predominant purpose was the goods, Connie's claim for the service would be under common law.

Looking at the options, option E says Connie under common law because the predominant purpose was goods. That seems to fit because the sale is UCC, and the service is common law.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another angle: the UCC would allow Connie to sue for the goods, but the service is a separate matter. But the question is about the service, so perhaps the outcome depends on whether the service was part of the UCC contract.

Alternatively, perhaps the service is considered part of the goods contract, so the entire agreement is under UCC. In that case, Connie can sue under UCC for the service.

But I don't think UCC covers services. So, the service would be under common law.

So, if the court finds the predominant purpose was goods, the sale is UCC, and the service is common law. Therefore, Connie can sue under common law for the service.

Looking at the options, option E says Connie under common law because the predominant purpose was goods. That makes sense because the service is a separate contract under common law.

So, I think the answer is E.

The question revolves around determining whether the contract between Connie and Computer Retailer Inc. is governed by the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) or common law. The contract includes both the sale of a laptop (a good) and a 5-year service agreement. The UCC applies to the sale of goods, while common law applies to services. The key issue is the predominant purpose of the contract.

If the predominant purpose is the sale of goods (the laptop), the contract is governed by the UCC. If the predominant purpose is the service agreement, it is governed by common law. The facts indicate that the service agreement costs more than the laptop, suggesting that the service might be the predominant purpose. However, the intent of the parties and the nature of the transaction also matter.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option E** states that Connie would prevail under common law because the predominant purpose was the sale of goods. This is inconsistent because if the predominant purpose was goods, the sale would be governed by the UCC, not common law. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

- **Option B** states that Connie would prevail under the UCC unless the predominant purpose was the service agreement. This aligns with the principle that if the predominant purpose is goods, the UCC applies, but if it is services, common law applies. This option is consistent with the analysis.

Given the analysis, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it accurately reflects the governing law based on the predominant purpose of the contract.
