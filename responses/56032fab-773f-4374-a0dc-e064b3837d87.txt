Okay, so I've got this question here about the distance from Earth to Altair. Let me try to figure this out step by step. The question says that the distance to Altair is one million times greater than the distance between Earth and the Sun. Right, I remember that the average distance from Earth to the Sun is about 150 million kilometers, but wait, sometimes it's given as 1 astronomical unit (AU), which is 149.6 million kilometers. Hmm, but wait, the answer options are in meters, so I'll need to convert everything into meters.

Wait, wait, let me get this straight. One million is 1,000,000, which is 10^6. So if I multiply the Earth-Sun distance by 10^6, that should give me the distance to Altair.

First, I should find out what the Earth-Sun distance is in meters. I think 1 AU is about 1.496 x 10^11 meters. Let me confirm that. Yes, because 1 kilometer is 1,000 meters, so 150 million kilometers is 150,000,000 km = 1.5 x 10^8 km. Multiply by 10^3 meters per km, that's 1.5 x 10^11 meters. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 150 million is 1.5 x 10^8, and then times 10^3 is 10^11. So 1 AU is approximately 1.496 x 10^11 meters, so I can use that for calculation.

So the distance to Altair is 1 million times that. So that's 1.496 x 10^11 meters multiplied by 10^6. Let me compute that. 1.496 x 10^11 * 10^6 = 1.496 x 10^(11+6) = 1.496 x 10^17 meters. Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see exactly that, but maybe I can approximate.

Wait, the options are rounded, so 1.496 is roughly 1.5. So 1.5 x 10^17 meters. Let me check the options. Option I is 1.5 x 10^16, which is one order of magnitude less. Option J is 1.5 x 10^17. Oh, that's exactly what I got. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Did I multiply correctly? Earth to Sun is about 1.5e11 meters. One million times that is 1.5e11 * 1e6 = 1.5e17. Yes, that's correct. So the correct option is J.

The distance from Earth to the Sun is approximately 1.5 x 10¹¹ meters. Multiplying this by one million (10⁶) gives the distance to Altair as 1.5 x 10¹⁷ meters. 

Answer: J
