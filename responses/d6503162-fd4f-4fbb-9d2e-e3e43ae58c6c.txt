Okay, so I've got this question about the Lion Man from Hohlenstein-Stadel cave. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my prehistory, but let me try to think this through.

First, the question is asking what the Lion Man is an example of, and the options are A to D. The options are mobiliary art, long-distance trade of exotic raw materials, parietal art, and a Venus figurine.

Wait, I remember that mobiliary art refers to portable objects, like sculptures or engravings that can be moved. Parietal art, on the other hand, is art that's on the walls of caves, like paintings or drawings. Venus figurines are those small statuettes of women, often with exaggerated features, like the Venus of Willendorf.

The Lion Man is a sculpture, right? So that makes me think it's a portable piece. But I'm a bit confused because I think some of the famous cave art, like in Lascaux, is parietal. But the Lion Man isn't a painting; it's a carved figure. So it's not parietal art. That would point me towards mobiliary art.

Wait, but wasn't the Lion Man found in Hohlenstein-Stadel cave? I think that's in Germany. The sculpture is made from mammoth ivory and has the body of a man with a lion's head. So it's a carved figure, which is definitely a portable object. So that would make it mobiliary art, which is option A.

Option B talks about long-distance trade. I don't think the Lion Man is about trade; it's more about art and possibly religious or symbolic purposes. So B probably isn't right.

Option D is a Venus figurine. But the Lion Man is a man with a lion's head, not a female figure. Venus figurines are usually female, so D isn't correct.

So putting it all together, the Lion Man is an example of mobiliary art because it's a portable sculpture. Therefore, the answer should be A.

The Lion Man from Hohlenstein-Stadel cave is a portable sculpture made from mammoth ivory, which fits the definition of mobiliary art. It is not parietal art, as it is not a cave wall painting, nor is it a Venus figurine, which typically represents female figures. Therefore, the correct answer is:

A
