Okay, so I need to figure out which statement isn't applicable to the securitization process. Let me start by recalling what securitization means. From what I remember, securitization is a process where a political actor (like a government) declares an issue to be a security threat, thereby legitimizing the use of extraordinary measures to address it. This concept is often discussed in the context of security studies and international relations.

The question gives me five options (A to E), and I need to find the one that's not applicable. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: "Where the securitizing actor is a democratic state, the relevant audience is usually the wider population who have the right to reject the speech act." Hmm, in a democracy, the government (the securitizing actor) would address the public, who can vote or express their opinions. So if the public disagrees, they can reject the speech act, like through elections. This makes sense because in democracies, the government's legitimacy comes from the people, so they have to consider public opinion. So A seems applicable.

Option B: "Securitization reveals the power of the securitizing actor." Securitization is a way for the actor to show their authority and control over defining threats. When a government declares something a security issue, it's asserting its power to act. So B looks correct and applicable.

Option C: "The adoption of extraordinary measures can retrospectively convince an audience of the existential threat." I think this is about how, by taking strong actions (like declaring a state of emergency), the government can make the public believe the threat was serious. It's like building consensus after the fact. This seems to fit with how securitization works, so C is applicable.

Option D: "The process of securitization is always reversible." Wait, I'm not sure about this. Once an issue is securitized, it's often hard to depoliticize it. For example, once a government has declared a war on terror, it's tough to take that back because the measures are seen as necessary. So if D says it's always reversible, that might not be true. Maybe sometimes it's not reversible, making D not applicable.

Option E: "Within authoritarian and other undemocratic regimes, the relevant political decision-making is often dominated by the military and political elite." In autocratic states, decisions are made by a small group at the top, not by the public. So the securitizing actor would be the elite, and the audience is more limited. This fits with how securitization works in such regimes, so E is applicable.

So the statement that's not applicable would be D, because securitization isn't always reversible. It can be, but it's not guaranteed or always the case.

The statement that is not applicable to the securitization process is D, as securitization is not always reversible. 

Answer: D
