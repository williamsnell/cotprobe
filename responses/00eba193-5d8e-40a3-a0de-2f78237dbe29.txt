Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the order of a factor group, specifically (Z_11 x Z_15)/<1,1>. Hmm, factor groups can be a bit tricky, but I remember that the order of a factor group is equal to the order of the group divided by the order of the subgroup we're factoring by.

Wait, so first, what's the order of Z_11 x Z_15? Well, Z_11 is a cyclic group of order 11, and Z_15 is another cyclic group of order 15. So when you take the direct product of two groups, their orders multiply. So 11 times 15 is 165. So the order of Z_11 x Z_15 is 165.

Now, the subgroup we're factoring by is <1,1>. I think this is the subgroup generated by the element (1,1) in Z_11 x Z_15. So I need to find the order of this subgroup. The order of an element (a,b) in a direct product is the least common multiple of the orders of a and b in their respective groups.

So, in Z_11, the order of 1 is 11 because 11 is prime, so the order of 1 is 11. Similarly, in Z_15, the order of 1 is 15 because 15 is the order of the group. Wait, no. Wait, the order of an element in Z_n is n when the element is 1, because you have to add it to itself n times to get back to 0. So yeah, the order of (1,1) is the lcm of 11 and 15.

Calculating lcm(11,15): 11 is prime, and 15 is 3*5. So lcm is 11*3*5 = 165. Wait, that can't be right because 165 is the order of the whole group. So the subgroup generated by (1,1) has order 165, which would mean it's the entire group itself. But that would imply that the factor group is trivial, with order 1. But looking at the options, A is 1, but that seems too straightforward.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the subgroup. Let me think again. The subgroup <1,1> in Z_11 x Z_15 is the set of all multiples of (1,1). So each element is (k*1 mod 11, k*1 mod 15) for some integer k. So the order of the element (1,1) is indeed the least common multiple of the orders of 1 in Z_11 and 1 in Z_15. Since 1 has order 11 in Z_11 and order 15 in Z_15, the order of (1,1) is lcm(11,15) = 165. So the subgroup has order 165, which is the same as the order of the entire group. So the factor group would have order 165 / 165 = 1. So the answer would be A:1.

But wait, that seems odd because usually, when you have a factor group like this, it's not trivial unless the subgroup is the whole group. Let me check if I made a mistake in calculating the order of the subgroup. Alternatively, perhaps the element is (1,1), but maybe in Z_11 x Z_15, the element (1,1) has an order that's the lcm of 11 and 15, which is indeed 165. Therefore, the factor group would have order 1. So the answer should be A:1.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option E is 11, F is 25, G is 20, etc. So maybe I messed up. Another approach: perhaps the subgroup generated by (1,1) has a smaller order. Maybe I should think about the structure theorem for finitely generated abelian groups or something. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the order of (1,1) differently.

Wait, another way: the order of (a,b) in G x H is the lcm of the orders of a in G and b in H. So in Z_11, 1 has order 11, and in Z_15, 1 has order 15. So lcm(11,15) is 165. So yes, the order is 165. So the subgroup <1,1> has 165 elements, same as the entire group, so the factor group is trivial. Therefore, the order is 1, which is option A.

The order of the factor group (Z_11 x Z_15)/<1, 1> is 1, as the subgroup <1, 1> has the same order as the entire group, making the factor group trivial.
