Okay, so I've got this problem here where John is supposed to earn $49 for handing out flyers, and he worked for 3.5 hours. He wants to find his hourly rate. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, the equation given is 3.5x = 49. I remember that to find the hourly rate, which is x in this case, I need to solve for x. So, the equation is saying that 3.5 times the hourly rate equals $49. 

To solve for x, I should divide both sides of the equation by 3.5. That way, I can isolate x on one side. So, x equals 49 divided by 3.5.

Wait, let me make sure I'm doing this right. Dividing 49 by 3.5. Hmm, 3.5 goes into 49 how many times? Let me think. 3.5 times 10 is 35, and 3.5 times 14 is 49 because 3.5 times 10 is 35, plus 3.5 times 4 is 14, so 35 +14 is 49. So 3.5 times 14 equals 49. That means x is 14.

Let me check the options. Option H is $14.00, so that should be the correct answer. I don't think I made any mistakes here because 3.5 times 14 is definitely 49. Yeah, that makes sense.

To determine John's hourly rate, we solve the equation \(3.5x = 49\) by dividing both sides by 3.5. This gives \(x = \frac{49}{3.5} = 14\). Therefore, John's hourly rate is $14.00.

Answer: H
