Okay, so I have this question about Hermitian operators. The question is asking which of the given operators are Hermitian. The operators are d/dx, id/dx, and d²/dx². The options are from A to D, with each making a different claim about which operators are Hermitian.

First, I need to remember what a Hermitian operator is. From what I recall, a Hermitian operator is one that is equal to its own adjoint. The adjoint of an operator is found by taking its complex conjugate and then transposing it. So, for an operator to be Hermitian, when you take its adjoint, you should get the same operator back.

Now, looking at the operators given:

a) d/dx
b) i*d/dx
c) d²/dx²

I think I should consider each one individually.

Starting with operator a) d/dx. I remember that the derivative operator isn't Hermitian on its own. The reason is that when you take its adjoint, you get something involving the derivative with respect to x times -1, because of integration by parts. Let me think about that more carefully. The adjoint of d/dx is actually -d/dx, right? Because when you compute the Hermitian adjoint (which involves the conjugate transpose), you end up with negative the derivative. So since (d/dx)† = -d/dx, it's not equal to itself, meaning d/dx is not Hermitian. So operator a) is not Hermitian.

Next, operator b) is i*d/dx. Let's compute its adjoint. The adjoint of i is -i (since i is imaginary, its complex conjugate is -i). The adjoint of d/dx is -d/dx, as I thought earlier. So the adjoint of i*d/dx would be (-i)*(-d/dx) = i*d/dx. Wait, because when you take the adjoint of a product, you reverse the order and take adjoints of each. So (i A)† = A† i†. Since A is d/dx, A† is -d/dx, and i† is -i. So (i A)† = (-d/dx)(-i) = i d/dx, which is the same as the original operator. So operator b) is Hermitian because (i d/dx)† equals i d/dx.

Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, because (i A)† is A† i†. A is d/dx, so A† is -d/dx. i† is the conjugate of i, which is -i. So (i A)† = (-d/dx) * (-i) = i d/dx. So yes, (i d/dx) is equal to its adjoint. So operator b) is Hermitian.

Now operator c) is d²/dx². Let's find its adjoint. The adjoint of d²/dx² is the adjoint of d/dx composed with itself. The adjoint of d/dx is -d/dx, so the adjoint of d²/dx² would be (-d/dx)^2, which is d²/dx². Wait, because (d/dx)^2 is d²/dx², and (-d/dx)^2 is the same as (d/dx)^2. So (d²/dx²)† = (d/dx)† (d/dx)† = (-d/dx)(-d/dx) = d²/dx². So (d²/dx²)† equals d²/dx², meaning it's Hermitian.

Wait, wait, am I sure about that? Because sometimes when taking adjoints of products, you have to be careful. Let me think more carefully. The adjoint of (d²/dx²) is actually the adjoint of (d/dx) composed with itself, which would be (d/dx)† multiplied by (d/dx)†, but since the order is important, the adjoint of AB is B† A†. So for d²/dx², which is (d/dx)(d/dx), the adjoint would be (d/dx)† (d/dx)†, which is (-d/dx)(-d/dx) = d²/dx². So yes, the adjoint is the same as the operator, so it's Hermitian.

Wait, but wait another thing. When you take the adjoint of (d²/dx²), is it really just (d/dx)† squared? Or is there a sign change? Because when you have (AB)†, it's B† A†. So for (d/dx)(d/dx), the adjoint is (d/dx)† (d/dx)†, which is (-d/dx)(-d/dx) = d²/dx². So yes, that's correct. So operator c) is Hermitian.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes I've heard that the second derivative operator isn't Hermitian, but maybe that's under certain boundary conditions. But in general, assuming that the functions vanish at infinity or have periodic boundary conditions, the second derivative is Hermitian. So I think operator c) is Hermitian.

So putting it all together: operator a) d/dx is not Hermitian, operator b) i d/dx is Hermitian, operator c) d²/dx² is Hermitian.

Looking at the options: the question is which of the operators is Hermitian, and the options are A to D.

Option B says "b and c are Hermitian." So that would be the correct choice because b is Hermitian and c is Hermitian.

Wait, but I thought operator a) is not Hermitian, so option B would be correct. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: none are Hermitian → No, because b and c are.

B: b and c are Hermitan → Yes.

C: only a is Hermitian → No, a isn't.

D: all are Hermitian → No, because a isn't.

So the correct answer should be B.

The Hermitian property of an operator is determined by whether it equals its adjoint. For the operators given:

- **a) \( \frac{d}{dx} \):** The adjoint of \( \frac{d}{dx} \) is \( -\frac{d}{dx} \), so it is not Hermitian.
- **b) \( i \frac{d}{dx} \):** The adjoint of \( i \frac{d}{dx} \) is \( i \frac{d}{dx} \), making it Hermitian.
- **c) \( \frac{d^2}{dx^2} \):** The adjoint of \( \frac{d^2}{dx^2} \) is \( \frac{d^2}{dx^2} \), making it Hermitian.

Thus, operators b and c are Hermitian. 

The correct answer is **B**.
