Okay, so I have to find the Laplace transform of f(t) = t². Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on Laplace transforms, but I remember some basic formulas. Let me think.

I think the Laplace transform of t^n is n! divided by s^(n+1), right? So for n=2, that would be 2! over s^(3). Wait, 2! is 2, so that would be 2/s³. Let me check if that's one of the options.

Looking at the options, option E is 2/s³ and option I is 3/s³. So E seems correct. But wait, did I get the formula right? Let me recall the definition.

The Laplace transform of t^n is indeed n! / s^(n+1). So for n=2, it's 2!/(s^3) = 2/s³. So yes, option E should be the answer.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The other options don't match this result. For example, option A is 2/s^4, which would be for n=3 maybe, but we're dealing with n=2. Option B is 1/s³, which would be for n=0, since 0! is 1 and s^1 is s. So yeah, E is correct.

The Laplace transform of \( f(t) = t^2 \) is found using the formula for \( \mathcal{L}\{t^n\} = \frac{n!}{s^{n+1}} \). For \( n=2 \), this gives \( \frac{2!}{s^3} = \frac{2}{s^3} \), which corresponds to option E.

Answer: E
