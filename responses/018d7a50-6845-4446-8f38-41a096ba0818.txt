Question:

A landlord was the owner of a two-story dwelling house and leased it completely furnished to a tenant for a 10-year period. Two years after the tenant entered into the leasehold agreement with the landlord, he subleases the house to his cousin. Thereafter, the cousin defaults on the rental payments. If the landlord brings an action to recover the past rent due from the cousin, the landlord will:

Options:

A: recover, because pnvity of estate exists between a landlord and sublessee.
B: recover, because there is privity of contract between a landlord and sublessee.
C: recover, because there is both privity of estate and privity of contract between a landlord and sublessee.
D: not recover, because privity of estate does not exist between the landlord and sublessee.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about landlord-tenant law, specifically dealing with subleases and privity. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

Alright, the situation is a landlord owns a two-story house and leases it fully furnished to a tenant for 10 years. Two years in, the tenant subleases the house to his cousin. Then the cousin stops paying the rent. The landlord sues the cousin for the past due rent. The question is whether the landlord can recover, and why.

From what I remember, privity is a key concept here. There are two types mentioned: privity of estate and privity of contract. Privity of estate refers to the direct relationship between the landlord and tenant, giving the landlord the right to recover rent. Privity of contract is about the contractual chainâ€”so if the original tenant subleases, does that create privity between the landlord and the subtenant?

Wait, in a sublease situation, the subtenant (cousin) is not a direct party to the original lease. So, does the landlord have privity of contract with the subtenant? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I think privity of estate exists regardless of subleasing because the original tenant holds the lease. But privity of contract might not because the subtenant isn't a signatory to the original lease.

So, if the landlord sues the cousin, they need privity to recover. If there's privity of estate, the landlord can recover because they're in a direct landlord-tenant relationship. But wait, the cousin is a subtenant, not the original tenant. So does the landlord have privity of estate with the cousin? Or is it only with the original tenant?

Wait, privity of estate is between the landlord and the original tenant, right? Because the original tenant is the one who holds the lease. The subtenant doesn't have privity of estate with the landlord. So if the landlord sues the cousin, they might not have the necessary privity unless the original lease allows it.

But I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The original tenant leased the property, so they have privity of estate with the landlord. When they sublease, the cousin becomes a subtenant. But the cousin doesn't have privity of estate with the landlord; that's between the original tenant and landlord. So the landlord can't directly sue the subtenant for rent because there's no privity of estate.

Wait, but some jurisdictions might allow the landlord to proceed against the subtenant if the original tenant is in default. Or maybe it's about privity of contract. If the original tenant is the one who's supposed to pay, and the sublease is just a contract between tenant and cousin, does that mean the landlord has privity of contract? Or is it that the subtenant isn't a party to the original lease, so no privity of contract.

I think privity of contract is about being part of the same chain. So if the landlord sues the subtenant, they need a contractual relationship. Since the subtenant isn't a signatory, there's no privity of contract. Therefore, the landlord can't recover from the cousin because neither privity of estate nor privity of contract exists between them.

Wait, but some sources say that in a sublease, the original tenant is still liable, but the subtenant isn't. So the landlord can't go after the subtenant unless the original lease allows it. Or maybe in some cases, the landlord can, but generally, without privity, they can't.

So looking at the options:

A: Recover because privity of estate exists. But I thought privity of estate is between landlord and original tenant, not the subtenant.

B: Recover because privity of contract exists. But the subtenant isn't a party to the original contract, so no privity.

C: Both privity of estate and contract. That doesn't seem right.

D: Not recover because privity of estate doesn't exist. That makes sense because the cousin isn't the original tenant.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain. Maybe in some cases, the landlord can recover from the subtenant if the original tenant is in default. Or maybe privity of estate is enough if the subtenant is treated as the tenant. Hmm.

Alternatively, another angle: the landlord can only recover from the original tenant, not the subtenant, because the subtenant isn't in privity. So the landlord can't sue the cousin directly. Therefore, the answer would be D: not recover because privity of estate doesn't exist.

But wait, privity of estate is between landlord and tenant. The subtenant isn't the tenant but a subtenant. So they don't have privity of estate. Therefore, the landlord can't recover from the subtenant.

So the answer should be D.
</think>

The key issue revolves around privity between the landlord and the sublessee. Privity of estate exists between the landlord and the original tenant, not the sublessee. Since the sublessee (cousin) is not a party to the original lease, there is no privity of estate or contract between the landlord and the sublessee. Therefore, the landlord cannot recover rent from the sublessee.

Answer: D
