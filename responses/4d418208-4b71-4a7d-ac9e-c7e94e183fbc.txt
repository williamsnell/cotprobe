Question:

A 22-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a 5-day history of sore throat and fever. During the past 3 days, she also has noticed a change in her voice and has had increased pain with swallowing. She has been taking acetaminophen since her symptoms began. Medical history is unremarkable and she takes no routine medications. Vital signs are temperature 40.0째C (104.0째F), pulse 130/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 102/66 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 97%. Examination of the oropharynx shows erythema, edema, and anterior displacement of the right side of the soft palate. The uvula is deviated to the left. There is a white exudate on the right tonsil. Trismus is noted. Palpation of the neck discloses enlarged, tender, mobile anterior cervical lymph nodes. In addition to antibiotic therapy, which of the following is the most appropriate management?

Options:

A: Oral nystatin therapy
B: Tranquilizer therapy
C: Intravenous methylprednisolone therapy
D: Oral pain reliever therapy
E: Intravenous antiviral therapy
F: Incision and drainage
G: Salt water gargle
H: Antacid therapy
I: Oral antifungal therapy
J: Inhaled corticosteroid therapy

Answer:

Okay, so I've got this question here about a patient in the emergency department, and I need to figure out the best management option. Let's break it down step by step.

The patient is a 22-year-old woman with a 5-day history of sore throat and fever. In the past 3 days, she's noticed a change in her voice and increased pain when swallowing. She's been taking acetaminophen since her symptoms started. Her medical history is unremarkable, and she doesn't take any routine medications. Vital signs show a high temperature of 40째C (104째F), pulse 130, which is pretty fast, and her blood pressure is 102/66, which is a bit low but not critically so. Her oxygen saturation is 97% on room air, so no immediate issue there.

Physical exam findings: The oropharynx is erythematous and edematous. The soft palate is displaced anteriorly on the right, and the uvula is deviated to the left. There's a white exudate on the right tonsil. Trismus is present, which means difficulty opening the mouth, a sign of something seriously affecting the throat. Neck palpation shows enlarged, tender, and mobile anterior cervical lymph nodes.

So, putting this together, the patient has a severe throat infection. The symptoms, including high fever, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, voice changes, and the physical exam signs like uvula deviation and exudate on the tonsil make me think of a peritonsillar abscess. Peritonsillar abscesses are usually caused by bacterial infections, often from Streptococcus or other organisms. They can be quite serious because they can cause airway obstruction if not treated promptly.

The question asks, besides antibiotics, what's the most appropriate management. Let's look at the options:

A: Oral nystatin - That's an antifungal, but the symptoms here don't suggest a fungal infection. More likely bacterial, so probably not.

B: Tranquilizer therapy - I'm not sure how that would help. Tranquilizers might help with anxiety but don't treat the infection or the abscess.

C: Intravenous methylprednisolone - Steroids can reduce inflammation, but I'm not sure it's the first line here. Maybe if there's severe swelling, but I think the main issue is the abscess.

D: Oral pain reliever - She's already taking acetaminophen, which is an oral pain reliever. Maybe stronger, but if there's an abscess, pain meds alone won't solve the problem.

E: Intravenous antiviral - The symptoms don't point to a viral cause. More likely bacterial, so IV antiviral isn't the answer.

F: Incision and drainage - This sounds like the treatment for an abscess. If there's a peritonsillar abscess, you need to drain it to relieve pressure and infection.

G: Salt water gargle - Might help with symptoms a bit, but it's not treating the underlying issue.

H: Antacid therapy - Doesn't seem relevant here.

I: Oral antifungal - Again, no indication of a fungal infection.

J: Inhaled corticosteroid - Probably not indicated for this condition.

So, the key issue seems to be a peritonsillar abscess. The treatment for that typically involves antibiotics, which they're already starting, and incision and drainage to remove the pus and relieve pressure on the airway. If the abscess is large enough, especially with signs like trismus and uvula deviation, it can obstruct the airway, so prompt drainage is important. Therefore, the most appropriate management besides antibiotics would be incision and drainage.

The patient presents with symptoms and findings indicative of a peritonsillar abscess, a condition that requires immediate attention. The most appropriate management, in addition to antibiotics, is incision and drainage to alleviate pressure and prevent airway obstruction.

Answer: F
