This question refers to the following information.
"Thereupon it was declared by the above-mentioned representatives of the aforesaid King and Queen of Castile, Leon, Aragon, Sicily, Granada, etc., and of the aforesaid King of Portugal and the Algarves, etc.:
[I.] That, whereas a certain controversy exists between the said lords, their constituents, as to what lands, of all those discovered in the ocean sea up to the present day, the date of this treaty, pertain to each one of the said parts respectively; therefore, for the sake of peace and concord, and for the preservation of the relationship and love of the said King of Portugal for the said King and Queen of Castile, Aragon, etc., it being the pleasure of their Highnesses, they, their said representatives, acting in their name and by virtue of their powers herein described, covenanted and agreed that a boundary or straight line be determined and drawn north and south, from pole to pole, on the said ocean sea, from the Arctic to the Antarctic pole. This boundary or line shall be drawn straight, as aforesaid, at a distance of three hundred and seventy leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands, being calculated by degrees, or by any other manner as may be considered the best and readiest, provided the distance shall be no greater than abovesaid. And all lands, both islands and mainlands, found and discovered already, or to be found and discovered hereafter, by the said King of Portugal and by his vessels on this side of the said line and bound determined as above, toward the east, in either north or south latitude, on the eastern side of the said bound provided the said bound is not crossed, shall belong to, and remain in the possession of, and pertain forever to, the said King of Portugal and his successors. And all other lands, both islands and mainlands, found or to be found hereafter, discovered or to be discovered hereafter, which have been discovered or shall be discovered by the said King and Queen of Castile, Aragon, etc., and by their vessels, on the western side of the said bound, determined as above, after having passed the said bound toward the west, in either its north or south latitude, shall belong to, and remain in the possession of, and pertain forever to, the said King and Queen of Castile, Leon, etc., and to their successors."

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Treaty of Tordesillas from 1494. The question is asking why the King and Queen of Castile and Aragon insisted on Spanish control west of the demarcation line. The options are A through D, and I need to figure out which one is the best explanation.

First, I'll try to recall what I know about the Treaty of Tordesillas. I remember it was signed between Spain and Portugal after Columbus's first voyage, which was 1492. The main issue was dividing the newly discovered lands in the Americas. So, the treaty was about avoiding conflict over territories that both were exploring.

The treaty established a line, called the demarcation line, which was 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands. Lands to the east of this line would go to Portugal, and lands to the west would go to Spain. This line was essentially drawn so that Spain could claim the Americas, which were west of this line, while Portugal got control over parts of Africa and other eastern areas.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: The Spanish desired to convert the Barbary states to Catholicism. Hmm. The Barbary states are in North Africa, which is more on the Portuguese side of the line. I'm not sure how this relates to the demarcation line. Plus, converting Barbary states was more about religious expansion, but the treaty was about territorial division, so maybe this isn't the best fit.

Option B: The Spanish believed Portugal did not know about their discovery of the New World. That might not make sense because the treaty was after Columbus's return, so both Spain and Portugal were aware of the New World. They were negotiating because they both wanted control over these new territories. So I don't think this is the reason.

Option C: The Spanish wanted to preserve the independence of Native states in the New World as a buffer against Portuguese expansion. Wait, that doesn't seem right. The Spanish were colonizers, so preserving Native independence doesn't align with their goals. They were more about conquering and converting, not preserving independence. Plus, the treaty was about dividing territories, not about creating buffers.

Option D: The Spanish thought India would be harder to conquer than the New World. I'm not sure about this. The Spanish were looking for a route to India, which was why they were sailing west. If they thought India was harder, maybe they wanted to focus on the New World. But I'm not certain how this ties into the demarcation line specifically.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the motivation behind the treaty. Spain wanted to control the lands that Columbus had discovered, which were to the west of the Cape Verde Islands. They were worried that Portugal would claim those areas since they had already established a presence in Africa and were exploring eastward. So by drawing the line, Spain secured the New World for themselves.

Another angle: the Treaty of Tordesillas was brokered by the Pope, who mediated between Spain and Portugal. The line was set so that Spain could have control over the lands Columbus had reached, which were in the Americas. So the Spanish wanted to ensure that any new territories discovered west of this line were theirs, preventing the Portuguese from claiming them.

So looking back at the options, the reason the Spanish wanted control west of the line was to secure their newly discovered territories, primarily the Americas, for themselves. They were likely concerned about Portuguese expansion into those areas, so the demarcation line was a way to divide the world between them.

Wait, but option C says they wanted to preserve Native independence. That doesn't fit because the Spanish were all about colonizing and converting, not preserving independence. So that's probably not it.

Option D: If they thought India was harder, maybe they wanted to focus on the easier New World. But I'm not sure if that's the main reason for the treaty. The main issue was avoiding conflict over the newly found lands, not the difficulty of conquering.

So, perhaps the correct answer is more about securing their own discoveries. The treaty was about dividing the territories they were both exploring, so the line was set to give Spain the lands west of it, which were the Americas.

Wait, but the options don't directly state that. Looking at the options again:

Option A is about converting Barbary states, which doesn't fit.

Option B: Spanish believed Portugal didn't know about their discovery. That seems unlikely because the treaty was after the discovery, so both knew.

Option C: Preserve Native independence as a buffer. Unlikely, as Spain wanted to conquer, not preserve.

Option D: Thought India was harder. Maybe, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The treaty was about avoiding conflict over the New World. So the Spanish wanted to ensure that the lands west of the line were theirs, to prevent the Portuguese from claiming them. So the reason was to secure their own discoveries and prevent Portuguese expansion into those areas.

But looking at the options, none directly state that. Hmm.

Wait, the question is about why the Spanish insisted on control west of the line. The best fit from the options is probably that they wanted to secure the lands they had discovered, which were in the New World west of the line.

Wait, option D says they thought India would be harder. Maybe they wanted to focus on the New World, which was easier to conquer. So by getting the west of the line, they could focus on the Americas, which were easier, rather than trying to go around Portugal's eastern routes.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the Spanish wanted to ensure they had control over the lands that Columbus had discovered, which were west of the line. So the main reason was to secure their own claims and prevent the Portuguese from interfering.

But looking at the options again, the best fit is likely option D, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that they wanted to establish a clear boundary to avoid conflict, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, the options are A to D, and I need to choose the best inference. The treaty was about dividing the world, so the line was set so that Spain got the west, which was the New World. So the Spanish wanted to control the west because they had discovered it, and they didn't want the Portuguese to interfere.

But looking at the options, which one aligns with that? None of the options directly say that. So perhaps the reason is that the Spanish were interested in the lands west of the line because they were the ones who had discovered them, and they wanted to prevent the Portuguese from claiming those territories.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the Spanish wanted to secure their newly discovered lands, which were in the west. That would be the main reason. But looking at the options, none of them directly say that.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The question is about why the Spanish insisted on control west of the line. The answer would relate to their interests in those lands.

Looking again at the options:

A: Convert Barbary states. Unlikely.

B: Spanish believed Portugal didn't know about their discovery. Maybe, but the treaty was after the discovery, so both knew.

C: Preserve Native independence as a buffer. Unlikely, as Spain wanted to conquer.

D: Thought India was harder. So they focused on New World.

So perhaps D is the answer. The Spanish thought India would be harder to conquer than the New World, so they wanted the New World for themselves. That makes sense because they were looking for a route to India but found the Americas, which were easier to conquer.

Therefore, the inference is that the Spanish wanted control west of the line because they thought the New World was easier to conquer than India, which was more difficult due to Portuguese control in the east.

So I think the answer is D.

The Treaty of Tordesillas was established in 1494 to resolve disputes between Spain and Portugal over newly discovered territories. The demarcation line, set 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands, aimed to divide these lands, granting the west to Spain and the east to Portugal. The Spanish sought control west of this line to secure their discoveries in the New World, which they found to be easier to conquer than the more challenging route to India. This strategic focus on the New World, where they could establish colonies and spread Catholicism, aligns with the idea that the Spanish believed India would be harder to conquer than the New World.

Answer: D
