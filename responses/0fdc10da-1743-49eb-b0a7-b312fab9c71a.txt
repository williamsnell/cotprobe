Okay, so I have this question about the pH of a neutral solution at 50°C, and I'm a bit confused because I remember that at 25°C, the pH of a neutral solution is 7. But wait, this is at a higher temperature, 50°C. Hmm, I think when temperature changes, especially for water, the pH of a neutral solution might change too. 

I recall that water dissociates into H+ and OH- ions, and the equilibrium constant for that is called Kw. At 25°C, Kw is 1e-14, which gives pH 7 as neutral because [H+] equals [OH-] at that point. But the question says pKw is 13.26 at 50°C. Oh, right, pKw is the negative log of Kw, so if pKw is 13.26, then Kw is 10^-13.26. 

So, for neutral solutions, the concentration of H+ ions equals the concentration of OH- ions. Since Kw = [H+][OH-], and they're equal, each would be the square root of Kw. Let me calculate that. 

Kw = 10^-13.26. Taking the square root would give [H+] = sqrt(10^-13.26). Let me compute that. The square root of 10^-13.26 is 10^(-13.26/2) = 10^-6.63. So [H+] is 1e-6.63. 

Wait, pH is the negative log of [H+], so pH = -log(1e-6.63). That's just 6.63. So the pH should be 6.63, which is lower than 7 because higher temperatures can increase ionization, making the solution more acidic. 

Looking at the options, G is 6.63. So the answer should be G.

The pH of a neutral solution at 50°C is determined by the autoionization of water, where the product of hydrogen ion concentration ([H+]) and hydroxide ion concentration ([OH-]) equals the ion product of water (Kw). At 50°C, pKw is 13.26, so Kw = 10^-13.26. For a neutral solution, [H+] = [OH-], meaning each concentration is the square root of Kw. 

Calculating [H+] = sqrt(Kw) = 10^(-13.26/2) = 10^-6.63. The pH is the negative logarithm of [H+], so pH = 6.63. Thus, the correct answer is:

G: 6.63

Answer: G
