Question:

Your swimming pool containing 60,000 gal of water has been contaminated by $5 \mathrm{~kg}$ of a nontoxic dye that leaves a swimmer's skin an unattractive green. The pool's filtering system can take water from the pool, remove the dye, and return the water to the pool at a flow rate of $200 \mathrm{gal} / \mathrm{min}$. Find the time $T$ at which the concentration of dye first reaches the value $0.02 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{gal}$.

Options:

A: 10.250 hours
B: 7.550 hours
C: 6.000 hours
D: 6.875 hours
E: 8.255 hours
F: 9.100 hours
G:  7.136 hour
H: 8.670 hours
I: 5.320 hours
J: 7.780 hours

Okay, so I have this problem about a swimming pool that's been contaminated with a dye, and I need to find out how long it takes for the concentration of the dye to reach 0.02 grams per gallon. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let's understand the problem. The pool has 60,000 gallons of water, and there's 5 kg of a nontoxic dye in it. That's 5000 grams because 1 kg is 1000 grams. The filtering system can process water at a rate of 200 gallons per minute. It takes water out, removes the dye, and puts it back. So, it's a filtering system that's trying to reduce the amount of dye in the pool over time.

I think this is a mixing problem where the concentration of dye decreases over time as the filter removes it. The key here is to model the situation with a differential equation.

Let me recall that for such problems, the rate of change of the amount of dye in the pool depends on the flow rate and the concentration of the dye in the water being filtered. The formula I remember is something like dA/dt = - (flow rate / volume) * A, where A is the amount of dye.

Wait, but let me make sure. The flow rate is 200 gal/min. The volume of the pool is 60,000 gal. So the fraction of the pool being replaced each minute is 200/60000, which simplifies to 1/300. But the amount of dye removed each minute would be the concentration at that time multiplied by the flow rate. Since concentration is A(t)/V, where A(t) is the amount of dye at time t, and V is the volume.

So the rate of change of A(t) is dA/dt = - (flow rate) * (A(t)/V). That's correct because the filter is removing dye at a rate proportional to the current concentration.

So the differential equation is dA/dt = -(200/60000) * A(t). Let me write that as dA/dt = -(1/300) * A(t).

This is a first-order linear differential equation, and its solution should be of the form A(t) = A0 * e^(-kt), where k is the rate constant. Here, k is 1/300 per minute.

So, A(t) = 5000 * e^(-t/300).

Now, the concentration of dye at time t is C(t) = A(t)/V = (5000 * e^(-t/300)) / 60000.

We need to find the time T when C(T) = 0.02 g/gal.

So setting up the equation:

0.02 = (5000 * e^(-T/300)) / 60000

Let me simplify this. First, 5000 divided by 60000 is 5/60, which is 1/12. So 5000/60000 = 1/12 ≈ 0.083333.

So 0.02 = (1/12) * e^(-T/300)

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute 5000/60000 correctly. 5000 divided by 60000 is 5/600, which is 1/120, which is approximately 0.0083333. Wait, no, wait:

Wait, 5000 divided by 60000: 60000 divided by 5000 is 12, so 5000/60000 is 1/12, which is approximately 0.083333. Wait, that can't be right because 1/12 is about 0.083333, but 5000 is much less than 60000. Hmm, actually, 5000 divided by 60000 is 5/60, which is 1/12, which is indeed approximately 0.083333.

Wait, but 5000 divided by 60,000 is 5000/60,000 = 5/60 = 1/12 ≈ 0.083333. So yes, correct.

So, 0.02 = (1/12) * e^(-T/300)

Now, let's solve for T.

Multiply both sides by 12:

0.02 * 12 = e^(-T/300)

0.24 = e^(-T/300)

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(0.24) = -T/300

So, T = -300 * ln(0.24)

Compute ln(0.24). Let me recall that ln(1) is 0, ln(e) is 1, and ln(0.5) ≈ -0.6931, ln(0.25) ≈ -1.3863, ln(0.2) ≈ -1.6094, ln(0.1) ≈ -2.3026.

Since 0.24 is between 0.2 and 0.25, let's compute ln(0.24):

Using a calculator, ln(0.24) ≈ -1.4271.

So, T ≈ -300 * (-1.4271) ≈ 300 * 1.4271 ≈ 428.13 minutes.

Now, convert 428.13 minutes to hours. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, divide by 60:

428.13 / 60 ≈ 7.1355 hours.

Looking at the options, option G is 7.136 hours, which matches closely.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, the differential equation: yes, dA/dt = -(200/60000) A(t) = -(1/300) A(t). So the solution is A(t) = 5000 e^(-t/300).

Then concentration C(t) = A(t)/60000 = (5000 e^(-t/300))/60000 = (5000/60000) e^(-t/300) = (1/12) e^(-t/300). So when C(t) = 0.02,

0.02 = (1/12) e^(-t/300)

Multiply both sides by 12: 0.24 = e^(-t/300)

Take ln: ln(0.24) = -t/300 → t = -300 ln(0.24)

As above, ln(0.24) ≈ -1.4271, so t ≈ 300 * 1.4271 ≈ 428.13 minutes.

Then 428.13 /60 ≈ 7.1355 hours, which is approximately 7.136 hours. So option G is correct.
