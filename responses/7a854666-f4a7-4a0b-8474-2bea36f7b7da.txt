Question:

A student eats 3 slices of pizza while studying for his Economics exam. The marginal utility of the first slice of pizza is 10 utils, the second slice is 7 utils, and the third slice is 3 utils. Which of the statements below holds true with the above data?

Options:

A: The total utility this student received from eating pizza is less than 20 utils.
B: The student would not eat any more pizza.
C: The total utility this student received from eating pizza is 20 utils.
D: The marginal utility of each slice of pizza is equal.
E: The student should have stopped eating pizza after 2 slices.
F: The marginal utility of the 4th slice of pizza will be 0.
G: The student should have only eaten one slice of pizza.
H: The total utility this student received from eating pizza is 30 utils.
I: The marginal utility of the 4th slice of pizza will be negative.
J: The student should have stopped eating pizza after the first slice.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question about marginal utility and total utility. Let me start by recalling what I know about these concepts.

Marginal utility is the additional satisfaction or utility you get from consuming one more unit of a good. Total utility is the sum of the marginal utilities of each unit consumed. So, when the marginal utility starts to decrease, that's part of the law of diminishing marginal utility, which I think is what's happening here.

The question says a student eats 3 slices of pizza. The marginal utilities are 10 utils for the first slice, 7 for the second, and 3 for the third. 

Let me break this down. The total utility would be the sum of these marginal utilities. So, 10 + 7 + 3 equals 20 utils. That would make option C correct if total utility is 20, but I should check the other options too.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Total utility less than 20. Well, 20 is exactly the sum, so A is false.

Option B: The student wouldn't eat more pizza. I think that's about whether the marginal utility is positive or negative. Since the third slice gave 3 utils, which is positive, maybe the student would want another slice if it gives more positive utility. Wait, but if the next slice (fourth) had zero or negative utility, then they'd stop. The question doesn't say about the fourth, so maybe B isn't necessarily correct yet.

Option C: Total utility is 20. That seems correct based on the sum, so C is a possible answer.

Option D: Marginal utility is equal for each slice. No, because 10,7,3 aren't equal. So D is wrong.

Option E: Should have stopped after 2 slices. Let's see, the marginal utility after two slices is 7, which is positive. Since it's still positive, the student might continue to get more utility from the third slice. So stopping after two might not be the right advice. Unless the marginal utility is decreasing but still positive, so they should continue until it becomes negative.

Option F: 4th slice's marginal utility is zero. I don't know that. The question doesn't provide data on the fourth slice, so I can't assume it's zero. It might be negative, but F says zero, which I can't confirm.

Option G: Should have eaten only one slice. That doesn't make sense because the student got positive utility from the second and third slices, so G is wrong.

Option H: Total utility is 30. Wait, 10+7+3 is 20, not 30. So H is wrong.

Option I: 4th slice's marginal utility is negative. Well, without data, I can't be certain, but typically, marginal utilities can become negative if you have too much. But the question doesn't say, so I can't choose I based on the given info.

Option J: Stop after the first slice. No, because the student got positive utility from the second and third, so J is wrong.

So, from this, C seems correct because total utility is 20. Also, looking at the options, E says the student should have stopped after 2 slices. But the marginal utility from the third slice was 3, which is positive, so the student should continue until marginal utility becomes negative. Since the third slice is still positive, they shouldn't stop yet. So E is wrong.

Wait, but what about option B? It says the student wouldn't eat any more pizza. If the marginal utility of the third slice is 3, which is positive, the student would still want more. Unless the next slice (fourth) has zero or negative, but the question doesn't provide that. So B isn't necessarily true because the student might still eat more.

So the correct statements are C (total utility 20) and E is incorrect because the student should continue. So the answer is C.

The total utility the student received from eating three slices of pizza is the sum of the marginal utilities: 10 + 7 + 3 = 20 utils. Therefore, the correct statement is that the total utility is 20 utils.

Answer: C
