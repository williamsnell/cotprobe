Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this economics question. The question is about the consequence of removing a protective tariff on imported steel. The options are A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I should understand what a protective tariff is. A tariff is a tax imposed on imported goods. A protective tariff is specifically designed to protect domestic industries by making imported goods more expensive. So when you remove a protective tariff, you're essentially reducing or eliminating that tax, which would make imported steel cheaper.

So, the question is asking what happens after this removal. Let me think about each option.

Option A: The quality of imported steel decreases. Hmm, I don't think so. Removing a tariff would make imported steel cheaper, but quality isn't directly affected by tariffs. Tariffs affect price, not quality. So A is probably not the answer.

Option B: Domestic steel producers lose their job. Well, if imported steel becomes cheaper, domestic producers might face more competition. Some might lose jobs, but it's not necessarily a direct consequence. It's possible, but maybe not the only effect. I'll keep this in mind but not settle on it yet.

Option C: Income is transferred from domestic steel consumers to foreign steel producers. Let me think. If the tariff is removed, the price of imported steel goes down. So consumers would pay less for imported steel. That means they save money, and the foreign producers get more sales because their steel is cheaper. So the income that was previously paid as a tariff (which went to the government) is now going to the foreign producers. So C could be correct because consumers pay less, and foreign producers get the income.

Option D: Income is transferred from steel consumers to domestic steel producers. Wait, if the tariff is removed, the price of imported steel decreases. So consumers would buy more imported steel, which would mean they're not buying as much domestic steel. So domestic producers might lose some income, not gain it. So D seems incorrect.

Option E: Allocative efficiency is improved. Allocative efficiency is about resources being used where they're most valued. If the tariff is removed, the market becomes more competitive. Cheaper imported steel might lead to better allocation, as the market decides based on lower prices. So E is a possibility, but I'm not sure if it's the main consequence here.

Option F: Imports fall. No, because if the tariff is removed, imports should increase, not fall. The price of imports goes down, so more people would buy them. So F is wrong.

Option G: The price of imported steel increases. That's the opposite of what would happen. Removing a tariff would lower the price of imported steel. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Income is transferred from foreign steel producers to domestic steel producers. That would mean foreign producers lose income and domestic gain, but removing the tariff would make imported steel cheaper, so foreign producers might gain more sales. So H doesn't seem right.

Option I: The supply of domestic steel decreases. Well, if imported steel is cheaper, domestic producers might produce less because they can't compete. So I could be correct, but I'm not sure if that's the immediate consequence.

Option J: The demand for domestic steel increases. No, because if imported steel is cheaper, people would buy more of that, so demand for domestic steel would likely decrease, not increase. So J is incorrect.

Let me go back to the options. The main effect of removing a tariff is that the price of imports decreases. So consumers pay less, which means they save money. The foreign producers benefit because their goods are now more affordable and may sell more. The government loses the tariff revenue.

Looking at the options again, option C says income is transferred from domestic consumers to foreign producers. That makes sense because the consumers are paying less for imported steel, and that money goes to the foreign producers instead of the government via the tariff. So C seems correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought about E, allocative efficiency. Removing a tariff allows the market to operate more freely, which can lead to allocative efficiency because resources are allocated based on prices rather than protection. So E is also a possible correct answer.

So now I'm a bit confused between C and E. Let me think again. The question asks for a consequence. Both could be correct, but which one is more directly a consequence?

The immediate consequence of removing the tariff is that the price of imported steel goes down, affecting who gets the income. So C is about income transfer, which is a direct effect. E is more about the efficiency of resource allocation, which is a broader economic effect but still valid.

But the options are presented as possible consequences, not necessarily the most immediate or direct. However, the question is about which is a consequence, so both could be correct. But looking at the options, only one is correct.

Wait, another angle: when a protective tariff is removed, the price of imported steel decreases. So consumers pay less, meaning they have more disposable income. Foreign producers gain because they sell more, and domestic producers might lose some sales. So the income that was previously paid as a tariff (which went to the government) is now going to the foreign producers. So the income transfer is from domestic consumers to foreign producers because consumers are paying less, and that money goes to foreign producers.

So yes, option C is correct.

Alternatively, allocative efficiency is about resources being allocated to their highest-valued use. Without the tariff, the market can allocate resources more efficiently, so E is also correct. But I need to see which option is presented.

Looking at the options, both C and E are possible. However, the question is about a consequence of removing the tariff. The immediate consequence is the change in prices and income transfers, while allocative efficiency is a broader economic effect but still a consequence.

Wait, but the options are singular. So the question is which is a consequence. Both C and E could be correct, but perhaps the intended answer is C.

Wait, let me think about the definition of allocative efficiency. It refers to resources being allocated where they are most needed. If the domestic industry was protected, resources were allocated to it due to the tariff. Removing the tariff allows the market to decide, which could lead to more efficient allocation. So E is also correct.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if E is the best answer. The question is about the consequence. The most direct consequence is the income transfer. So I think the answer is C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to find an example. Suppose the government removes a tariff on imported cars. The price of imported cars drops, so consumers pay less, and more money goes to foreign car manufacturers. So the income is transferred from domestic consumers to foreign producers, which is option C.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer should be C.

The removal of a protective tariff on imported steel leads to a decrease in the price of imported steel, making it more affordable for domestic consumers. This results in an income transfer from domestic steel consumers to foreign steel producers, as consumers pay less for imported steel and foreign producers gain more sales. While allocative efficiency may improve due to market competition, the most direct consequence is the income transfer described in option C.

Answer: C
