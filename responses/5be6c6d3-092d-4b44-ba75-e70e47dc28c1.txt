Question:

Catharine MacKinnon argues that since men dominate women, the question is ultimately one of power. Which proposition below is the most inconsistent with this argument?

Options:

A: The power dynamic is determined by individual strength and not gender.
B: The idea of 'woman' needs to be redefined.
C: Women inherently possess more power than men.
D: Gender-based inequality is a myth.
E: Men and women share equal power in society.
F: Equality is impossible because men define women as different.
G: Women can achieve equality through political pressure.
H: Men and women are inherently equal in all aspects.
I: The concept of power is subjective and varies from person to person.
J: The world is phallocentric and oppressive.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about Catharine MacKinnon's argument. The question is asking which proposition is most inconsistent with her argument that men dominate women, making it a power issue.

First, I need to recall what MacKinnon's stance is. She's a feminist legal theorist who argues that gender inequality is rooted in the power dynamics between men and women, particularly how men dominate women. She's critical of how power structures and inequalities are maintained, especially through things like pornography and the legal system.

The question is about identifying the proposition that's most inconsistent with her argument. So I need to look at each option and see which one directly contradicts her views.

Let's go through the options one by one:

A: The power dynamic is determined by individual strength and not gender. Hmm, MacKinnon would likely argue that gender is a significant factor in power dynamics, not just individual strength. So this seems inconsistent because she's saying it's about gender-based power, not individual traits.

B: The idea of 'woman' needs to be redefined. MacKinnon might agree with this because she's into feminist theory which often critiques and redefines gender roles and identities. So this isn't inconsistent.

C: Women inherently possess more power than men. Wait, MacKinnon's argument is about men dominating women, so saying women have more power would go against that. This seems inconsistent, but I need to check others.

D: Gender-based inequality is a myth. No, MacKinnon is all about pointing out that gender inequality exists, so this directly contradicts her. So this is a strong candidate.

E: Men and women share equal power in society. Again, this goes against her argument that men dominate, so this is inconsistent.

F: Equality is impossible because men define women as different. This aligns with her argument that power structures define and dominate women, so not inconsistent.

G: Women can achieve equality through political pressure. MacKinnon might support this as a method, so not inconsistent.

H: Men and women are inherently equal in all aspects. This contradicts her view that there's domination and inequality, so this is inconsistent.

I: The concept of power is subjective and varies from person to person. MacKinnon's argument is more about systemic power, so this might not be inconsistent, but it's a bit abstract. Not sure yet.

J: The world is phallocentric and oppressive. This aligns with her critique of male-dominated structures, so not inconsistent.

Now, I need to pick the most inconsistent. The question is which is the most inconsistent with her argument.

Option D says gender-based inequality is a myth. That's a direct contradiction because MacKinnon argues for the existence of gender-based inequality. So D is a strong contender.

Option C says women have more power, which also contradicts her, but perhaps D is more directly opposing her main point.

Wait, but the question is about the most inconsistent. So D is saying inequality is a myth, which is the opposite of what she says. Similarly, E says equal power, which is also opposite.

But I think D is more inconsistent because it's a fundamental denial of the existence of gender-based inequality, which MacKinnon's argument is all about.

Wait, but the original question is about the proposition that is most inconsistent. So the options that directly oppose her argument would be the ones that say there's no inequality or that power is equal.

So options D, E, and H all suggest equality or the opposite of her argument. Which one is the most inconsistent?

Looking back, the question is which is most inconsistent. So perhaps option D: "Gender-based inequality is a myth." That directly contradicts her argument that men dominate women, hence there is gender-based inequality.

Alternatively, option F says equality is impossible because men define women as different, which actually supports her argument about power dynamics. So not inconsistent.

Option I: The concept of power is subjective. MacKinnon's argument is about objective power structures, so this might be inconsistent, but perhaps not as much as D.

So I think the most inconsistent is D: Gender-based inequality is a myth.
</think>

The most inconsistent proposition with Catharine MacKinnon's argument that men dominate women, making it a power issue, is **D: Gender-based inequality is a myth**. This directly contradicts her stance on the existence of gender-based inequality and power dynamics.

Answer: D
