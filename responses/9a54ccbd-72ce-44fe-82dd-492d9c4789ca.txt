Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. Okay, so the question is about a hologram interference experiment using a helium-neon laser. The setup involves illuminating and viewing a surface under test at normal incidence. The displacement we're trying to determine is 2500 nm, and we need to find out by how many fringes it's represented in three different scenarios: (a) when the displacement is normal to the surface, (b) when it's at 45 degrees to the normal, and (c) when it's in the plane of the surface. The options are given from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I remember that in holography, the interference fringes are a result of the phase difference between the reference wave and the object wave. The number of fringes corresponds to the number of wavelengths the path difference represents. So, the formula I think is something like the number of fringes (N) is equal to the displacement (d) divided by the wavelength (λ) multiplied by some factor based on the angle or direction of the displacement.

Wait, the formula I recall is N = (2d sinθ)/λ, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I think it might be N = d/(λ/2) because each fringe corresponds to a half-wavelength change. Or wait, maybe N = d/(λ) because each full wavelength would cause a phase change of 2π, leading to a fringe every λ displacement. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, no, wait. In interference, a phase difference of 2π corresponds to a path difference of one wavelength. So, the number of fringes (which are essentially the number of phase changes) would be the total path difference divided by the wavelength. But how does the angle come into play here?

Let me think again. The standard formula for the fringe order is N = (d sinθ)/λ. But wait, that's for a setup where the light is at an angle θ, maybe in a Lloyd's mirror setup or something like that. But in this case, the surface is being viewed at normal incidence, so θ is 0 degrees for the normal case. Hmm, maybe the formula is different.

Wait, the problem says the displacement is at normal incidence, so maybe the fringes are based on the displacement along the direction of the light. Let me think about the setup. In a hologram, the object is illuminated, and the light scatters off it. The reference beam and object beam interfere. The fringes result from the relative phase changes between these two beams.

So, for a displacement d in the direction of the light (normal to the surface), the path difference would be d. Because when the surface moves by d, the object beam's path changes by d, while the reference beam's path remains the same. So the phase difference would be (2πd)/(λ), and the number of fringes would be this divided by 2π, which gives d/(λ) as the number of fringes. Wait, no, because each fringe corresponds to a phase change of 2π, so N = d/(λ) * 2π / (2π) ) → N = d/λ. Wait, that can't be right because units don't match. Let me check the units. If λ is in meters, d is in meters, then N would be unitless, which makes sense.

Wait, but wait, sometimes the formula is written as N = (2d)/λ because each fringe is a half-wavelength shift. Or maybe it's N = d/(λ/2), so N = 2d/λ. Hmm, I'm getting conflicting thoughts here.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is N = (d)/(λ) * 2, because the path difference for a phase shift of 2π is λ, so each fringe corresponds to λ/2 of path difference. So for a displacement d, the path difference is 2d sinθ, as in the standard interference formula. Wait, but that's for setups where the light is at an angle, like in Young's double slit. In this case, when viewed at normal incidence, the angle θ is 0, so sinθ is 0, which would give zero fringes, but that can't be right because displacement would cause a phase shift.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach this differently. The problem says it's a hologram interference experiment, and the surface is illuminated and viewed at normal incidence. So, the setup is probably similar to a shearing interferometer or something where the displacement leads to a phase shift in the returning wave.

In a normal hologram setup, when the surface is flat, you get a uniform reflection. If the surface is displaced, the path length changes, leading to a phase shift. The number of fringes would correspond to how many wavelengths of phase shift there is.

So, the formula for the number of fringes (N) is N = (d sinθ) / (λ/2), because each fringe corresponds to a phase change of π (half a wavelength), so the path difference per fringe is λ/2. So, N = (2d sinθ)/λ.

Wait, let me think again. Each fringe represents a phase change of 2π, which is a path difference of λ. So, if the path difference is d, then the number of fringes would be d/(λ) per direction. But I'm not sure about the exact formula.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula for fringes in a hologram due to displacement. From what I remember, in a Lloyd's mirror setup, the fringe spacing is given by (λ D)/(d), where D is the distance to the screen, d is the slit separation, but that's not directly applicable here.

Alternatively, in a Michelson interferometer, the fringe shift when one mirror is moved by d is N = (2d)/λ, because each mirror movement of λ/2 causes a phase shift of π, leading to a fringe. So, for a displacement d, the number of fringes would be (2d)/λ.

Wait, but in Michelson, it's 2d because the light goes to the mirror and back, so the total path difference is 2d. So, the number of fringes would be (2d)/(λ). So, if d is 2500 nm and λ is the wavelength of the laser.

Wait, the helium-neon laser typically emits at around 632.8 nm. So, λ ≈ 633 nm. Let's convert everything to the same unit. 2500 nm is 2.5 micrometers. Wait, wait, 2500 nm is 2.5 micrometers? No, wait, 1 micrometer is 1000 nm, so 2500 nm is 2.5 micrometers. But wait, that's a displacement of 2.5 micrometers. Hmm, but Michelson's fringes would be (2d)/λ. So, if d is 2500 nm, then 2d is 5000 nm. λ is 633 nm, so 5000/633 ≈ 7.90 fringes. So, that would be the case when the displacement is along the direction of the light, i.e., normal to the surface.

Wait, so case (a) is displacement normal to the surface, which would give about 7.9 fringes. That matches option D, which says (a) 7.9, but let's check the other cases.

Case (b) is displacement at 45 degrees to the normal. So, the component of displacement along the light direction would be d * cos(45). So, the path difference would be d * cosθ. Then, the number of fringes would be (2 * d * cosθ) / λ.

So, cos(45) is about 0.7071. So, d * cosθ = 2500 * 0.7071 ≈ 1767.75 nm. Then 2d cosθ = 3535.5 nm. Dividing by 633 nm gives approximately 5.59 fringes, which rounds to about 5.6 fringes. So, case (b) would be 5.6 fringes. But wait, looking at the options, which option has (a) 7.9 and (b) 5.6? Option D says (a) 7.9, (b)5.6, (c)0. So that would fit.

Case (c) is displacement in the plane of the surface. So, the displacement is perpendicular to the light's direction, meaning that the path difference is zero. So, the number of fringes would be zero because there's no change in the optical path length. So, case (c) is 0 fringes.

So putting it all together: (a) 7.9, (b)5.6, (c)0. Looking at the options, option D is (a)7.9, (b)5.6, (c)0. So the correct answer would be option D.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another approach: in the Michelson interferometer, when one mirror is moved, the number of fringes is (2d)/λ. So for normal displacement, that's correct.

But what about when the displacement is at an angle? The effective path difference would be d * cosθ, so the fringes would be (2 d cosθ)/λ.

In case (b), θ =45°, so cos45≈0.707, so (2 *2500 * 0.707)/633 ≈ (5000 *0.707)/633 ≈ 3535/633 ≈5.59≈5.6 fringes.

And in case (c), displacement in the plane, θ=90°, cos90=0, so no fringes, 0.

So yes, the answer is D: (a)7.9, (b)5.6, (c)0.

The question involves determining the number of fringes represented by a displacement of 2500 nm in a hologram interference experiment using a helium-neon laser. The displacement is analyzed in three scenarios: normal to the surface, at 45° to the normal, and in the plane of the surface. 

### Key Analysis:
1. **Case (a): Displacement Normal to the Surface**  
   When the displacement is along the direction of the laser beam (normal to the surface), the path difference is equal to the displacement. Using the formula for the number of fringes, \( N = \frac{2d}{\lambda} \), where \( d = 2500 \, \text{nm} \) and \( \lambda = 633 \, \text{nm} \):  
   \[
   N = \frac{2 \times 2500}{633} \approx 7.9 \, \text{fringes}.
   \]

2. **Case (b): Displacement at 45° to the Normal**  
   When the displacement is at an angle \( \theta = 45^\circ \), the effective path difference is \( d \cos\theta \). Substituting \( \cos(45^\circ) \approx 0.707 \):  
   \[
   N = \frac{2 \times 2500 \times 0.707}{633} \approx 5.6 \, \text{fringes}.
   \]

3. **Case (c): Displacement in the Plane of the Surface**  
   When the displacement is in the plane of the surface, it is perpendicular to the laser beam, resulting in no effective path difference. Thus, the number of fringes is:  
   \[
   N = 0 \, \text{fringes}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The correct option is **D**, which states:  
(a) 7.9 fringes, (b) 5.6 fringes, (c) 0 fringes.
