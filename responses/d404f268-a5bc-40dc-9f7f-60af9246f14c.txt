Question:

Distinguish between covalent and ionic bonds.

Options:

A: A covalent bond is the attraction between two atoms sharing multiple protons, whereas an ionic bond is the attraction between two neutrally charged atoms.
B: A covalent bond is a bond in which two atoms are held together by a shared pair of electrons. An ionic bond is a bond in which oppositely charged ions are held together by electrical attraction.
C: A covalent bond is created when one atom donates both electrons in a pair, and an ionic bond occurs when two positively charged ions attract each other.
D: A covalent bond is a bond formed when two atoms share a neutron. An ionic bond is a bond formed when two ions of different charges form a magnetic attraction.
E: A covalent bond involves the transfer of electrons from one atom to another, while an ionic bond involves sharing a pair of neutrons between two atoms.
F: A covalent bond is a bond where two atoms share a pair of protons. An ionic bond is a bond where two ions of the same charge are held together by their magnetic field.
G: A covalent bond is formed when two atoms share a pair of electrons. An ionic bond is formed when two atoms of the same charge are held together by electrical repulsion.
H: A covalent bond is formed by the attraction between ions of the same charge, and an ionic bond is formed when atoms share pairs of protons.
I: A covalent bond is a bond where two atoms share a pair of electrons unevenly, and an ionic bond is a bond where two atoms of opposite charges share a neutron.
J: A covalent bond occurs when two atoms share a pair of electrons with identical charges, while an ionic bond is the result of two atoms with similar electronegativities transferring electrons.

Okay, so I need to figure out the difference between covalent and ionic bonds. I remember from my chemistry class that bonds are the forces holding atoms together. There are different types, like covalent and ionic. Let me think about what each one is.

Covalent bonds are when atoms share electrons, right? Because atoms want to have a full outer shell, like eight electrons in their valence shell for nonmetals. So when they share electrons, they form a bond. For example, in water (H₂O), oxygen shares electrons with two hydrogen atoms. Each hydrogen shares one electron, and oxygen shares two, making two covalent bonds.

Ionic bonds, on the other hand, involve the complete transfer of electrons. One atom donates electrons to another. This usually happens between metals and nonmetals. The metal loses electrons and becomes a positive ion (cation), while the nonmetal gains electrons and becomes a negative ion (anion). These ions are attracted to each other because opposite charges attract. For example, in table salt (NaCl), sodium (Na) donates an electron to chlorine (Cl), forming Na⁺ and Cl⁻ ions, which are held together by ionic bonds.

Looking at the options, I need to find the correct description of each bond.

Option A says covalent is about sharing protons. Wait, protons are in the nucleus, and they don't move during bonding. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: Covalent is sharing a pair of electrons, and ionic is oppositely charged ions held by electrical attraction. That sounds right. Because covalent is sharing electrons, and ionic is ions attracting.

Option C talks about donating both electrons in a pair for covalent. No, covalent is sharing, not one donating both. That's more like a polar covalent bond or maybe ionic if it's a full transfer.

Option D says sharing a neutron. I don't think that's correct because neutrons are in the nucleus and don't participate in bonding. So D is wrong.

Option E: Covalent involves transferring electrons, while ionic shares neutrons. No, covalent is about sharing electrons, and ionic is about transferring electrons to form ions.

Option F: Sharing protons and same charge ions. Again, protons aren't shared. Plus, same charge would repel, not attract. F is incorrect.

Option G: Covalent is electron sharing, but ionic is same charge by electrical repulsion. No, ionic bonds are between opposite charges (attraction), not same. So G is wrong.

Option H: Covalent is ion attraction, which is ionic. So H is mixed up. Not correct.

Option I: Covalent shares electrons unevenly, which is more about polar covalent bonds. Ionic is neutron sharing—no, that's not right.

Option J: Covalent with identical charges sharing electrons. Identical charges would repel, so that doesn't make sense. Plus, ionic is about transferring electrons, not similar electronegativity.

So the correct answer should be B. It correctly describes covalent as sharing electrons and ionic as oppositely charged ions attracting.

The correct distinction is that covalent bonds involve the sharing of a pair of electrons between atoms, while ionic bonds involve the attraction between oppositely charged ions formed by the complete transfer of electrons.

Answer: B
