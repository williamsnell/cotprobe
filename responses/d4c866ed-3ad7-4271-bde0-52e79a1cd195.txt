Okay, so I have this question about how many different possible committees of 5 people can be chosen from a group of 15 people. The options are given from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

I remember from my math classes that when we're choosing a subset of people from a larger group where the order doesn't matter, we use combinations. Combinations are different from permutations because in combinations, the order isn't important. So, for example, if I choose person A and then person B, that's the same as choosing person B and then person A in combinations, but not in permutations.

The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items we're choosing. In this case, n is 15 because there are 15 people, and k is 5 because we're choosing a committee of 5.

So, plugging in the numbers, it would be C(15,5) = 15! / (5! * (15-5)!). Let me calculate that step by step. 

First, 15! is a huge number, but maybe I can simplify the factorial expressions before multiplying everything out. Let me write it out:

15! = 15 × 14 × 13 × 12 × 11 × 10! 

And (15 - 5)! is 10!, which is the same as in the numerator. So, the 10! cancels out from numerator and denominator.

So now the expression becomes:

C(15,5) = (15 × 14 × 13 × 12 × 11) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)

Let me compute the numerator first. 15 × 14 is 210. 210 × 13 is 2730. 2730 × 12 is 32,760. 32,760 × 11 is 360,360. So the numerator is 360,360.

Now the denominator is 5! which is 120. So, 360,360 divided by 120. Let's do that division step by step.

Dividing 360,360 by 120: Well, 360,000 divided by 120 is 3000 because 120 × 3000 = 360,000. Then, 360 divided by 120 is 3. So adding those together, 3000 + 3 = 3003.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check the multiplication again. Oh no, wait, I think I made a mistake in the numerator calculation. Let me recalculate the numerator more carefully.

15 × 14 is indeed 210. 210 × 13: 200 ×13 is 2600, and 10×13 is 130, so 2600+130=2730. Then 2730 ×12: 2730×10 is 27,300, plus 2730×2=5,460, so total 32,760. Then 32,760 ×11: 32,760×10=327,600, plus 32,760 = 360,360. So that part is correct.

Denominator is 5! = 120. So 360,360 ÷ 120. Let me compute that again. 360,360 divided by 120.

Another way: 360,360 ÷ 120 = (360,360 ÷ 10) ÷ 12 = 36,036 ÷ 12.

36,036 ÷ 12: 12 × 3,000 = 36,000. So 3,000 with a remainder of 36. 36 ÷12=3, so total is 3,003. So yes, the result is 3,003.

Looking back at the options, option A is 3,003. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me think again. Could I have made a mistake in the factorial simplification? Let's see. The formula is correct because C(n,k) is n!/(k!(n−k)!), which I applied correctly with n=15 and k=5. So the calculation seems right. Therefore, the answer is A.

The number of possible committees is calculated using combinations, specifically C(15,5) = 3,003.
