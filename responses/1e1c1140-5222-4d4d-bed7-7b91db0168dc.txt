Question:

The 'extension pattern' that Parker (1976) identified was said to be:

Options:

A: the tendency of part-time employees to integrate work and leisure activities
B: a neutral balance between work and leisure as neither connected nor oppositional, as evidenced by semi-skilled manual and clerical workers
C: an approach adopted by students where academic work is done during leisure time
D: a lifestyle of unskilled manual workers, who saw work as a chance to escape from idle leisure time
E: a neutral balance between work and leisure as both connected and oppositional, as evidenced by full-time employees
F: the lifestyle of clerical and unskilled manual workers, who saw leisure time as a chance to escape from alienating work
G: characteristic of homemakers, whose household chores spill over into their leisure time
H: the tendency of students to leave essay-writing until the last minute and then ask for an extended deadline
I: characteristic of professionals and skilled workers, whose work interests spilled over into leisure time

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Parker (1976) and his concept of the 'extension pattern.' I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that Parker talked about different ways people integrate their work and leisure. The key terms I recall are 'segmented pattern' and 'extension pattern.' The segmented pattern is where work and leisure are kept separate, like after work, you switch off and don't think about work during your free time. On the other hand, the extension pattern is when these two areas blend together more. 

Wait, but I need to be careful. I think the extension pattern involves people who see their work and leisure as connected in some way, maybe even with some opposition. So it's not completely separate but also not neutral. 

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A says it's part-time employees integrating work and leisure. That doesn't sound right because Parker's extension pattern isn't specifically about part-timers. It's more about how people perceive the integration, regardless of their employment status.

Option B talks about a neutral balance where work and leisure are neither connected nor oppositional, using semi-skilled manual and clerical workers as examples. Hmm, neutral balance doesn't quite fit with what I remember. I thought the extension pattern had some connection or opposition, not neutral.

Option C is about students doing academic work during leisure. That sounds more like a specific group behavior, not a general pattern identified by Parker.

Option D describes unskilled manual workers seeing work as a chance to escape idle leisure. That seems a bit off. Work as an escape from leisure? I'm not sure that's the extension pattern.

Option E mentions a neutral balance but with full-time employees, and it says both connected and oppositional. Wait, neutral but connected and oppositional? That seems conflicting. Maybe E is trying to say that work and leisure are connected but also opposing, which could fit the extension pattern. But I'm not certain yet.

Option F says it's the lifestyle of clerical and unskilled manual workers, using leisure to escape alienating work. That might be more aligned with the segmented pattern, where they separate work and leisure to escape from it, rather than blending them.

Option G is about homemakers whose chores spill into leisure. That sounds more like a specific group rather than a broader pattern.

Option H is about students procrastinating and asking for extensions. That's a specific behavior, not a general pattern.

Option I describes professionals and skilled workers whose work interests spill into leisure. This sounds like the extension pattern because their work and leisure are connected, with interests overlapping.

Wait, I think I might have mixed up the terms. Parker's extension pattern is when work and leisure are connected, possibly with some opposition, but not necessarily in a positive way. The segmented pattern is when they're kept separate. So, professionals and skilled workers (option I) might have work spilling into leisure, which fits the extension pattern.

But earlier I thought E was about a neutral balance with both connected and oppositional. Let me clarify. Parker's work talks about two main patterns: the segmented and the extended. The extended pattern involves work and leisure being both connected and oppositional. So, maybe E is trying to say that, but I'm not sure about the neutral part. Option I seems to fit better because it's about professionals whose work interests spill over into leisure, indicating a blend where work and leisure are connected.

Wait, but option E says "a neutral balance between work and leisure as both connected and oppositional, as evidenced by full-time employees." Neutral balance doesn't quite fit. The extension pattern isn't neutral; it's about the integration, which could be positive or negative. So E might not be the right choice.

So, going back, I think the correct answer is I: characteristic of professionals and skilled workers, whose work interests spilled over into leisure time. That aligns with the extension pattern where work and leisure are integrated, not necessarily neutral.

The correct answer is **I**. Parker (1976) identified the 'extension pattern' as a way of life where work and leisure are integrated, particularly among professionals and skilled workers whose interests and activities spill over into their leisure time. This pattern reflects a blending of work and leisure, distinguishing it from the segmented pattern where the two are kept separate.
