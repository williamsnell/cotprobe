Question:

Options:

A: Initial value is 2, slope is -4
B: Initial value is -1, slope is 2
C: Initial value is 1, slope is 2
D: Initial value is 0, slope is undefined
E: Initial value is 0, slope is 2
F: Initial value is -1, slope is -2
G: Initial value is 0, slope is -2
H: Initial value is 1, slope is undefined
I: Initial value is 0.5, slope is -1
J: Initial value is 1, slope is -2

Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the initial value and the slope of the function f(t) = e^(-2t) u(t). The question asks me to do this by plugging t = 0^+ and also using the initial-value theorem. Then, I have to choose the correct option from A to J.

First, I remember that u(t) is the unit step function, which is 0 for t < 0 and 1 for t ≥ 0. So, when t approaches 0 from the positive side (t = 0^+), u(t) becomes 1. 

So, evaluating f(t) at t = 0^+ would be e^(-2*0) * 1, which simplifies to e^0 = 1. So the initial value should be 1. That narrows down the options to either C, H, or J, since those are the ones with initial value 1.

Next, I need to find the slope. The slope at t = 0^+ would be the derivative of f(t) evaluated at that point. Let me compute the derivative of f(t).

The function f(t) is e^(-2t). Its derivative with respect to t is -2e^(-2t). So, the slope at t = 0^+ is -2e^(0) = -2*1 = -2.

So, the initial value is 1, and the slope is -2. Looking back at the options, option J says initial value is 1 and slope is -2. That seems correct.

Wait, but I should also check using the initial-value theorem. I remember that the initial-value theorem relates the initial value of a function in the time domain to the limit of F(s) as s approaches infinity, where F(s) is the Laplace transform of f(t). The theorem states that f(0^+) equals the limit as s approaches infinity of s*F(s).

So, let's find the Laplace transform of f(t). The Laplace transform of e^(-at) u(t) is 1/(s+a). Here, a is 2, so F(s) = 1/(s+2).

Applying the initial-value theorem: limit as s→∞ of s*(1/(s+2)) = limit s/(s+2). Dividing numerator and denominator by s, we get 1/(1 + 2/s). As s approaches infinity, 2/s approaches 0, so the limit is 1/1 = 1. That confirms the initial value is 1.

Now, for the slope, I think another way might be to consider the derivative. Alternatively, maybe using the final-value theorem, but wait, that's for the limit as t approaches infinity, not the slope. So, maybe I should just stick with the derivative approach.

Since the derivative at t=0^+ is -2, as calculated earlier, that gives the slope of -2. So, initial value 1, slope -2. So option J is correct.

The initial value is found by evaluating f(t) at t = 0^+, which gives f(0^+) = 1. The slope is the derivative of f(t) at t = 0^+, which is -2. Using the initial-value theorem confirms the initial value is 1. Thus, the correct answer is J.
