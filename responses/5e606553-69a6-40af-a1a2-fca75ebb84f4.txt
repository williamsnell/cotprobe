Question:

 Sirius, one of the hottest known stars, has approximately a blackbody spectrum with $\lambda_{\max }=260 \mathrm{~nm}$. Estimate the surface temperature of Sirius.


Options:

A: 8500 $\mathrm{~K}$
B: 15000 $\mathrm{~K}$
C: 9500 $\mathrm{~K}$
D: 11000 $\mathrm{~K}$

Okay, so I've got this question about Sirius, a star, and I need to find its surface temperature based on the given wavelength of maximum emission. Hmm, I remember something about blackbody radiation and Wien's Law from my classes. Let me think through this.

Wien's Law states that the wavelength of maximum emission for a blackbody is inversely proportional to the temperature of the body. The formula I think is lambda_max * T = constant. Oh right, that constant is Wien's displacement constant, which is approximately 2.8977719 × 10^-3 m·K. 

So, the question gives lambda_max as 260 nm. Wait, I should convert that into meters because the constant is in meters. 260 nm is 260 × 10^-9 meters, which is 2.6 × 10^-7 meters.

Now, using Wien's Law: T = (Wien's constant) / lambda_max.

Plugging in the numbers: T = (2.8977719e-3 m·K) / (2.6e-7 m). Let me calculate that. 

Dividing 2.8977719e-3 by 2.6e-7. Let me think, 2.8977719e-3 is about 0.002898, and 2.6e-7 is 0.00000026. So dividing 0.002898 by 0.00000026 gives me roughly 11,145 K. Wait, let me check that with a calculator approach.

Actually, 2.89777e-3 divided by 2.6e-7. Let's do it in terms of exponents. 10^-3 divided by 10^-7 is 10^4. So 2.89777 / 2.6 is about 1.1145. Then multiplied by 10^4 gives 11,145 K. So approximately 11,100 K. 

Looking at the options, option D is 11,000 K, which is the closest. So the answer should be D.

To determine Sirius' surface temperature, apply Wien's Law: \( T = \frac{2.8977719 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m·K}}{\lambda_{\text{max}}} \). Given \( \lambda_{\text{max}} = 260 \, \text{nm} = 2.6 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \), calculate \( T \approx 11,145 \, \text{K} \). The closest option is D: 11,000 K.

Answer: D
