Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many Jinas have appeared during our age. I'm not too familiar with Jinas, but I think they are related to a certain religious tradition. Let me try to recall what I know.

Jinas... Oh right, Jinas are the23 Tirthankaras in Jainism, right? Wait, no, I think the 24th is the last one. So in Jainism, there are 24 Tirthankaras who have appeared in each age. Each Tirthankara is a spiritual teacher or a prophet.

Wait, but the question is about how many Jinas have appeared during our age. So in the current age, how many have come? I remember that each age has a certain number of Tirthankaras. I think the number is 24, but maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no, I think in each age, there are 24 Tirthankaras, including the last one who is the founder of the faith. So the 24th is the last Tirthankara, and he's the one who started the Jain tradition. So in our current age, all 24 have appeared, but the last one is the most recent.

But wait, the question is asking how many Jinas have appeared during our age. So if each age has 24, that would mean 24 Jinas have appeared. So looking at the options, C is 24. But I'm a bit confused because I thought the number was 24 Tirthankaras in total, not per age.

Wait, no, in Jainism, it's said that in each half of the cosmic time cycle, there are 24 Tirthankaras. So in our current half-cycle, which is the descending part, the 24 Tirthankaras have appeared. So the total number in our age is 24.

So the answer should be C:24.

The question asks how many Jinas have appeared during our age. In Jainism, it is believed that 24 Tirthankaras appear in each half of the cosmic time cycle. Since we are in the current half-cycle, all 24 Jinas have appeared. 

Answer: C
