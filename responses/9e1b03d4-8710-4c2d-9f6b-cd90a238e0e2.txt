Okay, so I need to figure out which coping strategy Bu is using. The question says that Bu is often late for appointments but says it's because she had more important things on her mind. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I should recall what each of these coping strategies means. Let's go through the options one by one.

A: Projection. I think projection is when someone attributes their own feelings or thoughts onto someone else. Like, if I'm angry at my boss, I might say my coworker is the one who's angry. But in this case, Bu isn't blaming someone else, she's explaining her lateness with her own thoughts. Not sure if this fits.

B: Regression. Regression is when someone reverts to an earlier stage of development, like acting childishly when stressed. Doesn't seem related to Bu's situation.

C: Immunization. I'm not too familiar with this term in the context of coping strategies. Maybe it's a distractor; perhaps it's not one of the common ones.

D: Assimilation. Assimilation usually refers to the process of taking in new information and fitting it into existing knowledge. Not sure how that applies here.

E: Avoidance. Avoidance is when someone avoids dealing with a problem by ignoring it or not thinking about it. But Bu is giving a reason for being late, so she's addressing it, just not taking responsibility.

F: Displacement. Displacement is redirecting feelings from one target to another. For example, if you're upset with your boss, you come home and yell at your partner. In this case, Bu is displacing the responsibility of being late by saying she had more important things on her mind. So she's not taking responsibility for her lateness but instead attributing it to other important tasks.

G: Denial. Denial is refusing to accept reality or facts. If Bu denied she was late, that would be denial, but she's acknowledging it but giving a reason. So maybe not denial.

H: Accommodation. This is an adjustment to the environment to reduce stress. Not directly related here.

I: Sublimation. Sublimation involves channeling unacceptable impulses into socially acceptable activities. Like turning anger into exercise. But Bu isn't transforming her feelings; she's just explaining her lateness.

So, putting it together, Bu is using displacement because she's redirecting the responsibility of her lateness onto other important tasks she was doing. She's not taking ownership of the lateness but instead attributing it to something else.

The correct answer is F: Displacement. Bu is redirecting the responsibility of her lateness onto other important tasks, which fits the definition of displacement as a coping strategy.
