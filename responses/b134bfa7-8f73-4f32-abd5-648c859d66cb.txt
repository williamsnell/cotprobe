Question:

A 50-year-old woman comes to the office for the first time because of recurrent abdominal pain. Review of her extensive medical chart, which she has brought with her, discloses that she has a long history of varying physical symptoms. Definitive causes for these symptoms have not been found despite extensive diagnostic studies, consultations with many physicians, and several surgical explorations. She gives dramatic and exaggerated descriptions of her present and past symptoms, and she makes conflicting statements about her history. She has been hospitalized at least 23 times since age 18 years. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A: Conversion disorder
B: Histrionic personality disorder
C: Occult medical disorder
D: Somatic symptom disorder

Okay, so I have this question about a patient with a long history of abdominal pain and various symptoms. Let me try to break it down. The woman is 50 years old and has been having recurrent abdominal pain. She's come to the office for the first time, bringing her extensive medical chart. From what I gather, she's had a lot of symptoms over the years, but no definitive cause has been found despite all the tests, consultations, and even surgeries. That makes me think it's something that's hard to pin down medically.

She describes her symptoms as dramatic and exaggerated. I remember that in psychology, when someone describes symptoms in a very dramatic way, it might point towards a certain disorder. Also, she makes conflicting statements about her history, which could indicate that she's not entirely consistent or maybe even embellishing her story.

Her hospitalization history is pretty staggeringâ€”23 times since age 18. That's a lot. So she's been in and out of hospitals a lot, but no clear medical diagnosis. Now, the options given are Conversion disorder, Histrionic personality disorder, Occult medical disorder, and Somatic symptom disorder.

Let me think about each option. Conversion disorder is when a person experiences physical symptoms that can't be explained by a medical condition, often as a reaction to psychological stress. But conversion disorder is more about neurologic symptoms like blindness or paralysis, I think. Her main issue is abdominal pain, so maybe not the best fit.

Histrionic personality disorder (HPD) is characterized by excessive emotionality, dramatic behavior, and attention-seeking. People with HPD often have a history of seeking attention and may present with dramatic symptoms. They might exaggerate their symptoms, which aligns with her giving exaggerated descriptions and conflicting stories. But HPD is a personality disorder, so it's more about long-term behavior patterns rather than a specific episode.

Occult medical disorder suggests there's an underlying medical condition that hasn't been found yet. But the question says extensive studies and explorations haven't found anything. It's possible, but the emphasis on her presentation makes me think it's more about her behavior than an undiagnosed medical issue.

Somatic symptom disorder involves persistent physical symptoms that cause significant distress and impairment. The key here is that the symptoms are real to the patient, and they interfere with daily life. But the patient's symptoms are exaggerated and conflicting, which might not fit as well as another disorder.

Wait, but the question says she's brought her extensive chart, which shows varying symptoms and no definitive cause. She's been hospitalized a lot, but no diagnosis. So the focus is on her presentation and history.

Another angle: somatic symptom disorder requires that the symptoms cause distress and are persistent, but it doesn't necessarily involve dramatic exaggeration or malingering. Conversion disorder is more about conversion of psychological issues into physical symptoms, often with a specific psychological trigger.

Histrionic personality disorder might explain her dramatic presentation and seeking attention through her symptoms. She might be using her symptoms to gain attention or control over her environment. But HPD is a personality disorder, which is a more enduring pattern of behavior.

Alternatively, could it be somatic symptom disorder with a focus on pain? But the key points are the exaggeration and the lack of a medical cause. Somatic symptoms can be real but not caused by a medical condition, but in this case, the symptoms are exaggerated.

Wait, another thought: Somatoform disorders are a category that includes conversion disorder, somatization disorder, etc. Somatization disorder involves multiple physical symptoms with no clear cause. But I think the DSM has moved away from somatization disorder and more towards somatic symptom disorder.

The patient's exaggerated descriptions and conflicting history make me think she's not just experiencing real symptoms but perhaps amplifying them. So, could it be somatic symptom disorder? Or is it histrionic?

Histrionic personality disorder is more about being the center of attention, using dramatic means to achieve that. So her symptoms might be a way to maintain that attention.

Alternatively, conversion disorder is more about the physical symptoms as a conversion of psychological stress into physical form, but it's often more specific (like paralysis, seizures).

In this case, the patient's main issue is recurrent abdominal pain, which is vague and can have many causes, both medical and psychological. But since no medical cause is found, and her presentation is exaggerated, it's pointing towards a psychological cause.

Between Histrionic and Somatic symptom disorder. Histrionic is a personality disorder, which is a long-term issue, while somatic symptom disorder is more about the current symptoms.

The question is about the most likely diagnosis. The patient's history of dramatic and exaggerated symptoms, conflicting statements, and frequent hospitalizations without a diagnosis suggests that her symptoms are more about her presentation than an underlying medical condition.

So, Histrionic personality disorder might be the answer because it fits the dramatic presentation, exaggerated symptoms, and attention-seeking behavior. But wait, HPD is a personality disorder, so it's a long-term pattern. The patient's behavior fits that description.

Alternatively, is it somatic symptom disorder? Because she's experiencing somatic symptoms that are distressing, but without a medical basis. But the key is that she's exaggerating and making conflicting statements, which might align more with malingering or factitious disorder, but those aren't options here.

Wait, the options are A to D, which are Conversion, Histrionic, Occult, Somatic.

If I think about the DSM-5, somatic symptom disorder involves one or more somatic symptoms that are distressing and result in significant disruption. The person may have persistent thoughts about the severity of their symptoms. But in this case, the symptoms are exaggerated, and she's making conflicting statements, which might suggest a different underlying issue.

Histrionic personality disorder is characterized by excessive emotionality, suggestibility, and being easily influenced by others. People with HPD often seek reassurance and have a history of unstable relationships. Their symptoms are often dramatic and may be used to manipulate others.

So putting it all together, the patient's presentation fits more with Histrionic personality disorder because of her exaggerated symptoms, attention-seeking, and dramatic presentation. Conversion disorder might not fit as well because it's more about a specific conversion of symptoms, and there's no evidence of a neurological issue here.

Thus, the most likely diagnosis is Histrionic personality disorder.

The patient is a 50-year-old woman with a long history of abdominal pain and various unexplained symptoms. Despite extensive medical evaluations, no definitive cause has been identified. Her presentation includes dramatic and exaggerated descriptions of her symptoms, conflicting statements, and frequent hospitalizations. These features suggest a psychological rather than purely medical explanation for her symptoms.

**Analysis of Options:**

- **A: Conversion disorder**  
  Conversion disorder involves physical symptoms (e.g., blindness, paralysis) resulting from psychological stress. While the patient has abdominal pain, her symptoms are more consistent with exaggeration and attention-seeking behavior, which aligns less with conversion disorder.

- **B: Histrionic personality disorder (HPD)**  
  HPD is characterized by excessive emotionality, dramatic behavior, and attention-seeking. The patient's exaggerated symptoms, conflicting statements, and frequent hospitalizations align with this diagnosis. Her behavior suggests she may be using her symptoms to gain attention or control her environment, consistent with HPD.

- **C: Occult medical disorder**  
  This option implies a hidden medical condition causing her symptoms. However, the question specifies that extensive diagnostic studies have not found a cause, making this less likely.

- **D: Somatic symptom disorder**  
  Somatic symptom disorder involves persistent physical symptoms causing distress and impairment. While the patient experiences somatic symptoms, her exaggerated and conflicting descriptions suggest a more dramatic presentation, which is more characteristic of HPD.

Given the patient's history of dramatic symptoms, attention-seeking behavior, and lack of a medical diagnosis, the most likely diagnosis is **Histrionic personality disorder (HPD)**.

**Answer: B**
