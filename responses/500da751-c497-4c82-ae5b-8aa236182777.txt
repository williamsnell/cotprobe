Okay, so I need to figure out the sum of 711 and 497 and see which range it falls into. Let me start by adding the numbers step by step.

First, I'll add the hundreds place: 700 + 400 equals 1100. That seems straightforward. Then, the tens place: 10 + 90 equals 100. Wait, no, that's not right. Oh, wait, 711 is 700 + 10 + 1, and 497 is 400 + 90 + 7. So when adding the tens place, it's 10 + 90, which is 100. Then the ones place: 1 + 7 equals 8.

So adding those together: 1100 (hundreds) + 100 (tens) + 8 (ones) equals 1208. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, let me double-check. 700 + 400 is 1100. 10 + 90 is 100, so 1100 + 100 is 1200. Then 1 + 7 is 8, so 1200 + 8 is 1208. Yeah, that's right.

Now I need to see which option includes 1208. Let's look at the options:

A: 2,000-2,200 – way too high.
B: 50-400 – way too low.
C: 750-1,000 – 1208 is higher than 1000, so no.
D: 1,500-1,700 – 1208 is lower than 1500, so no.
E: 450-700 – 1208 is higher, so no.
F: 400-650 – no, same reason.
G: 1,300-1,500 – 1208 is just below 1300, so no.
H: 500-750 – 1208 is higher than 750.
I: 1,700-1,900 – way higher.
J: 1,050-1,300 – 1208 is within this range because 1050 is less than 1208, and 1300 is higher than 1208.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I calculate correctly? Let me add 711 and 497 again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

711
+497
------
Let's add the units: 1 + 7 = 8.
Tens: 1 + 9 = 10, so carry over 1.
Hundreds: 7 + 4 = 11, plus the carried 1 makes 12.
So total is 1208. Yep, that's correct.

So 1208 is between 1050 and 1300, which is option J. But wait, option H is 500-750, which is lower than 1208, so that's not right. Option J is the correct range. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial addition. Let me try another approach: rounding.

711 is approximately 700, and 497 is approximately 500. 700 + 500 is 1200. So the estimate would be around 1200, which is within 1050-1300. So the answer should be J.

The sum of 711 and 497 is 1208. Estimating, 700 + 500 = 1200, which falls within the range of 1,050 to 1,300.

Answer: J
