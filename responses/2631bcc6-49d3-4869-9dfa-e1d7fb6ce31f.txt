Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the potential energy of an isolated spherical conductor with radius R and a surface charge density σ. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that the potential energy (U) of a charge distribution can be calculated using the formula involving the electrostatic potential energy. I think the general formula is something like U = (1/2) * Q * V, where Q is the total charge and V is the potential at the surface of the conductor. But wait, I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, I recall that the potential energy can also be expressed in terms of the charge and the capacitance, where U = (1/2) * Q * V. Since for a conductor, the capacitance C is Q/V, so maybe that comes into play here.

Wait, another approach comes to mind. The potential energy stored in a charged conductor can be found using the formula U = (1/(8πε₀)) * (Q²/R). I think I saw that somewhere, but I need to make sure I'm not mixing things up.

Let me break it down. The conductor is isolated and spherical, so it's a conductor with radius R. The surface charge density σ is given, and I need to express U in terms of R.

First, I should find the total charge Q on the sphere. Since it's a conductor, the charge resides on the surface. The surface area of a sphere is 4πR², so Q = σ * 4πR².

Now, the potential at the surface of a conducting sphere is V = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q/R). So the potential V is proportional to Q/R.

The potential energy U is (1/2) * Q * V because each infinitesimal charge contributes to the energy by moving against the potential created by the existing charge. So plugging in V, U becomes (1/2) * Q * (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q/R).

Substituting Q with σ * 4πR²: U = (1/2) * (σ * 4πR²) * (σ * 4πR²)/(4πε₀ R).

Wait, let me compute that. Let's see:

U = (1/2) * Q²/(4πε₀ R) because Q is σ * 4πR², so Q² = σ² (4πR²)^2.

So, Q²/(4πε₀ R) is (σ² * 16π² R^4) / (4πε₀ R) = (σ² *4 π R^3)/ε₀.

But wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try another approach. The formula for the self-capacitance of a sphere is C = 4πε₀ R. So, since U = (1/2) Q V and V = Q/C, substituting gives U = (1/2) Q²/C. Substituting C, it becomes (1/2) Q²/(4πε₀ R).

So U = Q²/(8πε₀ R). That seems right. Now, looking at the options, option I is Q²/(8πε₀ R), which matches. Option A is Q²/(16πε₀ R), which would be if I had used 8πε₀ R in the denominator without the 1/2 factor properly accounted for.

Wait, let me double-check the self-capacitance. Yes, the capacitance of a sphere is indeed C = 4πε₀ R. So U = (1/2) Q²/(4πε₀ R) = Q²/(8πε₀ R), which is option I. So the correct answer should be option I.

The potential energy of an isolated spherical conductor can be determined using the formula \( U = \frac{Q^2}{8\pi\epsilon_0 R} \), where \( Q \) is the total charge and \( R \) is the radius of the sphere. This result aligns with option I.

Answer: I
