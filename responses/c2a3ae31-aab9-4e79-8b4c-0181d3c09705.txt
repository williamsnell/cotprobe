Question:

A man purchased a house that needed substantial repairs. The man financed the purchase of the house by borrowing funds from a bank. He signed a note to the bank and secured repayment of the loan with a mortgage. After purchasing the house, the man borrowed money from his credit union to make the repairs. The man signed a note to the credit union; this note was also secured by a mortgage on the house. Both mortgages were promptly recorded in the order granted. The man was personally liable on both loans. The man moved into the house and made the necessary repairs. He later defaulted on the debt to the bank, and the bank initiated judicial foreclosure proceedings, naming both the man and the credit union as parties to the action. An outside party acquired the house at the foreclosure sale. After the expenses of the sale and the balance due the bank have been paid, $5,000 remains in the sale the bank have been paid, $5,000 remains in the sale proceeds. The outstanding balance of the credit union loan is $20,000. The man and the credit union both claim the $5,000. There is no applicable statute. Who is entitled to the $5,000?

Options:

A: The credit union, because the man is personally liable on the debt.
B: The bank, because it initiated the foreclosure proceedings.
C: The man, because the outside party received title to the house subject to the second mortgage.
D: The man, because he was the original owner of the house.
E: The credit union, because the credit union has priority.
F: The man, because of his equitable right of redemption.
G: The outside party, because they purchased the house at the foreclosure sale.
H: The man, because he has made significant improvements to the property.
I: The credit union, because it provided the funds for the necessary repairs.
J: The credit union, because the man defaulted on the loan to the bank.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out who gets the $5,000 from the foreclosure sale. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, the man bought a house that needed repairs. He took out a loan from a bank, signed a note, and gave a mortgage as security. Then, he borrowed more money from his credit union for repairs, signed another note, and secured that with another mortgage on the same house. Both mortgages were recorded, so they're both on the public record. The man is personally liable on both loans, so if the property doesn't cover the debt, he still has to pay.

He made the repairs and moved in. But then he defaulted on the bank loan. The bank foreclosed, and both the man and the credit union were named in the action. So the bank sold the house, and after paying off the costs and what was owed to them, there's $5,000 left. The credit union still owes $20,000 on their loan, and now both the man and the credit union are claiming the $5k.

I remember that in foreclosures, the order of the mortgages matters because they determine priority. The first mortgage is usually paid off first, then the second. But wait, both the bank and the credit union have mortgages on the house. Since they were both recorded, which one takes priority? I think it's about the order they were recorded. The question says they were recorded in the order they were granted. So the bank's mortgage was first, then the credit union's. That makes the bank's mortgage a first lien and the credit union's a second lien.

When the bank foreclosed, they got the house sold, and the proceeds would first cover the bank's debt and any foreclosure costs. Then, any remaining money is supposed to go to the next lienholder, which is the credit union. But wait, here only $5k is left, and the credit union still owes $20k. So does the $5k go to the credit union? Or does the man get it because he's the one who defaulted, or maybe because he has some rights?

I'm a bit confused about the rights of the borrower after foreclosure. I think once the property is sold, the proceeds go to pay off the first mortgage, then the second, and any excess goes to the borrower. But in this case, the credit union is still owed money, so maybe the $5k is applied to their loan. But the man is also claiming it. 

Wait, there's something about equitable redemption. That's when the borrower can redeem the property even after foreclosure by paying off the debt. So if the man can still pay the remaining amount, he might have an equitable right to get the surplus from the sale. But does that apply here? The credit union is still owed $20k, and the sale only produced $5k after the bank's debt was paid. So maybe the man can't fully redeem, but maybe he has some rights to that $5k.

Alternatively, maybe the $5k is for the credit union because they have the second mortgage. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The bank's mortgage is first, so when the house is sold, the bank gets their money first. Then the credit union's mortgage is next, so any remaining proceeds go to them. But in this case, after the bank took their share, only $5k is left. The credit union's loan is $20k, so the $5k would be applied to that. But the man is also claiming it.

Wait, but the man is personally liable on both loans. So if the credit union's mortgage is second, they would get their $5k from the sale proceeds. But maybe the man can still get the surplus because he's the one who had the equity. Or perhaps the $5k is part of the credit union's collateral, so they should get it.

I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Bank has first mortgage.
2. Credit union has second mortgage.
3. House sold for enough to pay bank's balance and costs, leaving $5k.
4. Credit union still owes $20k, so the $5k would go to them to reduce their loan.
5. But the man is personally liable, so maybe he can still claim the surplus because he's the one who had the equity.

Wait, but in a foreclosure, the surplus goes to the borrower. The bank takes what's owed to them, and any excess is given back to the borrower. But here, the credit union is a junior lienholder, so their claim would be after the bank. So the $5k would be given to the credit union to apply to their debt. But if the credit union's debt is $20k, then $5k is just a part of that. So the credit union would take the $5k, and the man's personal liability would still require him to pay the remaining $15k.

But wait, the question says that the man and the credit union are both claiming the $5k. So who is entitled? I think the surplus after paying the first mortgage and costs goes to the next lienholder. So the credit union would get the $5k. But the man is claiming it because he's the original owner. Or maybe because he has an equitable right to redemption.

Alternatively, maybe the $5k is given to the man because he's the one who had the equity. I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A: Credit union because man is personally liable.
B: Bank because they initiated foreclosure.
C: Man because title was subject to second mortgage.
D: Man because original owner.
E: Credit union because priority.
F: Man because equitable redemption.
G: Outside party because bought at sale.
H: Man because improvements.
I: Credit union because provided funds for repairs.
J: Credit union because man defaulted on bank.

Hmm. So the key is the order of liens. Bank first, credit union second. So after the bank is paid, the credit union is next. So the $5k goes to the credit union. But the options don't have E as the correct answer. Wait, E is "The credit union, because it has priority." But the credit union has second priority, so E might not be correct. Or maybe priority is determined by recording first, so bank has priority, credit union second. So the $5k would go to the credit union because it's their turn after the bank.

Wait, but the options say E is "The credit union, because it has priority." But the bank has higher priority. So E might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the credit union's mortgage is a lien, and after the bank's debt is paid, the credit union can claim the surplus.

Wait, but in a foreclosure, the proceeds go to pay the first mortgage, then any surplus is given to the borrower. But here, the credit union is a second mortgagee, so perhaps they're considered as a general creditor for the surplus. Or maybe the surplus after the first mortgage goes to the second mortgagee. I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe the surplus is what's left after paying off all liens. So the bank gets their share, then the credit union gets theirs, and any remaining money is given to the borrower. But in this case, the credit union's loan is $20k, so the $5k would be applied to that, leaving them still owed $15k. But the man is personally liable, so maybe he can't claim the $5k because it's part of the credit union's collateral.

Wait, but the man is also a party to the foreclosure. So maybe he's entitled to the surplus because he's the one who had the equity. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F: the man because of his equitable right of redemption. Equitable redemption allows a borrower to redeem the property even after foreclosure by paying the debt. So if the man can pay the $5k, he might be entitled to it as his surplus.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about it again. The bank foreclosed, sold the house, used the proceeds to pay themselves and costs, leaving $5k. Since the credit union is a second lienholder, they would get their share next. But the man is also claiming it. 

Wait, maybe the $5k is not enough to cover the credit union's debt, so the credit union can't take it. Instead, the surplus goes back to the man. Because the surplus is what's left after paying the first mortgage and costs. The credit union's mortgage is a lien, but the surplus after the first mortgage is given to the borrower. So maybe the $5k goes to the man, not the credit union.

If that's the case, then the correct answer would be F: the man because of his equitable right of redemption. Or maybe option C: the man because title was subject to the second mortgage. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the $5k is allocated to the credit union as their security interest. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: in a foreclosure, the first mortgagee (bank) gets their money first. Then, the surplus is distributed. The credit union is a second mortgagee, so they would have a claim on the surplus. But in this case, the surplus is $5k, which is less than what they're owed ($20k). So the credit union would take the $5k as a credit against their loan, leaving the man still liable for the remaining $15k. But the question is who is entitled to the $5k. So perhaps the credit union gets it because they have a lien on the property.

But the options are a bit tricky. Let me look at the options again:

Option E: Credit union because of priority. But the bank has higher priority.

Option I: Credit union because they funded repairs. But that's not how liens work; it's about the order of recording.

Option F: Man because of equitable redemption. That might mean he can get the surplus.

Option C: Man because title was subject to second mortgage. Not sure.

Wait, in a foreclosure sale, the proceeds go to the first lienholder (bank), then any surplus is given to the next lienholder (credit union) up to the amount owed, and any remaining goes to the borrower. But in this case, the credit union's debt is $20k, and the surplus is only $5k, so the credit union would take the $5k as a credit. But the question is about who is entitled to that $5k.

Alternatively, the $5k is the surplus after the bank's debt, so it belongs to the man. Because after the bank is paid, the surplus is what the borrower is entitled to.

So perhaps the correct answer is F: the man because of his equitable right of redemption. Or maybe C: the man because the title was subject to the second mortgage.

Wait, but the second mortgage is still on the title, so the credit union's mortgage would be junior. So when the bank forecloses, they take the property, and the credit union's mortgage is extinguished. Or does it survive?

I think when the first mortgage is foreclosed, the second mortgage is also foreclosed, but the second mortgagee can still have a claim on the surplus. So the surplus is given to the second mortgagee up to their debt, and any excess to the borrower.

In this case, the surplus is $5k, which is less than the credit union's $20k debt. So the credit union would take the $5k as a credit, and the man would still owe $15k personally. But the question is who is entitled to the $5k from the sale proceeds. So the credit union would take it as a credit against their loan.

But the options don't have that. Wait, looking at the options again:

Option E: Credit union because of priority. But the bank has higher priority.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is F: the man because of his equitable right of redemption. Because even though the credit union has a second mortgage, the man can still get the surplus.

Alternatively, perhaps the bank, as the first mortgagee, gets the surplus. But I don't think so because the bank's debt was already paid.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about it this way: in a foreclosure, the first mortgagee (bank) is paid first. Then the surplus is given to the next lienholders in order. The credit union is the next in line, so they get the $5k. But the options don't have that as a choice. Wait, option E says "the credit union, because it has priority." But the bank has higher priority, so E can't be correct.

Wait, maybe the $5k is not enough to pay the credit union's debt, so the credit union can't claim it. Therefore, the surplus goes to the man. So the correct answer would be F: the man because of his equitable right of redemption.

Alternatively, maybe the man is entitled to the surplus because he's the one who had the equity in the property. So the $5k goes to him, and the credit union can't claim it because it's not enough to cover their debt. So the man gets the $5k.

I'm starting to think that the correct answer is F: the man because of his equitable right of redemption.

The question revolves around the distribution of surplus funds ($5,000) from a foreclosure sale after the bank and credit union have been paid. The bank holds the first mortgage, while the credit union holds the second. The key issue is determining who is entitled to the surplus.

1. **Foreclosure Process**: The bank, as the first mortgagee, is paid first from the sale proceeds. Any surplus after covering the bank's debt and costs is then allocated to the next lienholder, which is the credit union. However, the credit union's loan balance is $20,000, and the surplus is only $5,000. This means the credit union can take the $5,000 as a credit against their debt, leaving the man still liable for the remaining $15,000.

2. **Equitable Redemption**: The man, as the original borrower, retains an equitable right of redemption. This allows him to claim any surplus from the sale proceeds after the first mortgagee has been paid. Since the $5,000 is surplus after the bank's debt, it belongs to the man.

3. **Analysis of Options**: 
   - **Option F** aligns with the principle of equitable redemption, where the man is entitled to the surplus after the first mortgagee is paid.
   - Other options either misrepresent the order of priority or confuse the role of the credit union in the foreclosure process.

**Answer**: F
