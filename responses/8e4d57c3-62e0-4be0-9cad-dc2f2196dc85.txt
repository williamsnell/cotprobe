Okay, so I've got this problem here about electrical current flowing through a carbon steel plate, and I need to find the temperature at the center. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the plate is 1/2 inch thick, 4 inches wide, and 2.5 feet long. They apply a potential of 12 volts. The lateral faces (which I think are the sides, maybe the width and length) are at 1500°F, and I need to find the center temperature. Oh, and heat loss from the ends is neglected. Also, the heat generated is uniform across the section.

Wait, so this is a steady-state condition. That probably means that the heat generated by the current is being conducted away through the sides and ends, but since ends are neglected, heat loss is only through the sides and maybe the top and bottom. Or wait, the plate is flat, so maybe it's a rectangular plate, and the ends are the 4-inch width ends? Or the 2.5 ft length ends? Hmm, the problem says the lateral faces are at 1500°F, so maybe those are the two longer sides (the length ends) or the width ends? I'm a bit confused.

The plate dimensions: 1/2" thick, 4" wide, 2.5 ft long. Let me convert everything to feet for consistency. 1/2 inch is 0.0417 ft thick, 4 inches is 0.333 ft wide, and 2.5 ft long.

Resistivity (rho) is given as 1.25e-4 ohm-ft. Thermal conductivity (k) is 2.8 Btu/hr-ft-°F.

The heat generated is due to the current. But wait, electric current produces heat because of the resistance. So I need to find the current first, maybe? Or perhaps I can find the power generated and then figure out the temperature distribution.

Wait, maybe I should find the current using Ohm's law, but for that I need the resistance of the plate. The resistance R is given by R = rho * (length / area). The plate is conducting current along its length, so the length is 2.5 ft, and the cross-sectional area is thickness * width. Thickness is 0.0417 ft, width is 0.333 ft. So area A = 0.0417 * 0.333 ≈ 0.0139 ft².

So R = rho * (L / A) = 1.25e-4 ohm-ft * (2.5 ft / 0.0139 ft²) ≈ 1.25e-4 * (180.288) ≈ 1.25e-4 * 180 ≈ 0.0225 ohms.

Then, voltage V is 12 volts, so current I = V/R = 12 / 0.0225 ≈ 533.33 amps. Wow, that's a lot of current.

Now, the power generated is P = V * I = 12 V * 533.33 A ≈ 6400 watts. Wait, but wait, power can also be calculated as P = I² R. Let me check: (533.33)^2 * 0.0225 ≈ (284,444) * 0.0225 ≈ 6400 watts. Yep, that matches.

But wait, the problem says to assume the heat generated is uniform across the section. So the heat is generated per unit volume. So maybe I can find the volumetric heat generation q (in W/cu.ft or Btu/hr/cu.ft) and then model the heat transfer.

Wait, power is in watts, which is Joules per second, but thermal conductivity is given in Btu/hr-ft-°F. So maybe I need to convert units.

Let me see: 1 watt is approximately 3.41214 Btu/hr. So 6400 watts is 6400 * 3.41214 ≈ 21,821.5 Btu/hr. That's the total heat generated per hour.

But wait, that's the total power. Since the heat is uniformly generated, the volumetric rate (q) would be total power divided by volume.

The volume of the plate is thickness * width * length. So 0.0417 ft * 0.333 ft * 2.5 ft ≈ 0.0417 * 0.333 ≈ 0.0139 ft², then *2.5 gives ≈ 0.03475 ft³.

So q = total heat / volume = 21,821.5 Btu/hr / 0.03475 ft³ ≈ 627,000 Btu/hr-ft³.

Wait, that's a huge number, but let's proceed.

Now, the plate is conducting heat. Since it's a flat plate, the heat transfer would be through the thickness and the width, but since the ends are neglected, perhaps it's a 2D problem, or maybe a 1D problem if the plate is long and thin.

Wait, the plate is 2.5 ft long, 4 inches wide, and 0.5 inches thick. So the thickness is much smaller, so maybe it's a 1D conduction problem through the thickness.

Wait, but the lateral faces (the two ends) are at 1500°F. So perhaps the plate is being cooled on the two ends, and the heat is conducted through the length. Or maybe the sides are the 4-inch width ends, and the heat is conducted through the thickness.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as a 1D conduction problem through the thickness, with the two ends (the 4-inch width sides) at 1500°F, and I need to find the center temperature.

In 1D steady-state conduction, the temperature profile is linear if the heat generation is uniform. The formula for the temperature at a point x is T(x) = T1 + (q * x)/(2*k) + (T2 - T1)/2, where T1 and T2 are the temperatures at the two ends. Wait, no, wait, I think that's not exactly right. Let me think.

In a 1D conduction with uniform heat generation, the solution is T(x) = (q x)/(2k) + (T1 + T2)/2. Wait, no, perhaps when heat is generated uniformly, the temperature gradient is linear, but I might need to set up the differential equation.

The general equation for steady-state 1D conduction with heat generation is:

d²T/dx² = - q / k

Integrating, the solution is T(x) = (q/(2k)) x² + C1 x + C2.

Applying boundary conditions: at x=0, T = T1; at x=L, T = T2.

Wait, but in this case, maybe the plate is symmetric, so the ends are at the same temperature, 1500°F. But wait, is the plate being cooled on both ends, so both ends are at 1500°F, and the center is higher? Or perhaps it's a plate with heat generated uniformly, and the ends are kept at 1500°F.

Wait, perhaps the plate is long, so the ends (the length ends) are at 1500°F, but the heat is generated through the plate's thickness.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to model it.

Assuming the plate is long compared to its thickness, so that edge effects can be neglected, and it's a 1D problem along the thickness. So the plate has a thickness of t = 0.0417 ft, and the two faces (top and bottom) are at 1500°F. Wait, no, the lateral faces are at 1500°F. Wait, the lateral faces would be the longer sides, i.e., the 2.5 ft length sides. So perhaps the plate is being cooled on the two 2.5 ft long sides, which are the lateral faces.

Wait, but that would complicate things because then it's a 2D problem. Alternatively, maybe the plate's ends (the 4-inch width ends) are at 1500°F, and heat is conducted along the length of 2.5 ft. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the plate is being cooled on the two 4-inch wide ends. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think in terms of the heat equation.

The heat transfer is governed by the equation:

q_x = -k A (dT/dx)

Where q_x is the heat flux in the x-direction, k is thermal conductivity, A is the area perpendicular to heat flow, and dT/dx is the temperature gradient.

The heat generated per unit volume is q = rho * J^2, where J is current density. Or, since power is generated as I² R, and the volume is involved, perhaps I can find the volumetric heat generation.

Wait, earlier I found q as the volumetric heat generation rate as approximately 627,000 Btu/hr-ft³. That seems high, but let's proceed.

So, the heat equation with uniform heat generation is:

d²T/dx² = - q / k

Integrating this, we get:

dT/dx = (-q/(2k)) x + C

Integrate again:

T(x) = (-q/(4k)) x² + C x + D

Now, applying boundary conditions. Let's say the plate is between x=0 and x=L, where L is the thickness, 0.0417 ft. The ends at x=0 and x=L are at 1500°F.

Wait, but if the plate is cooled on both ends at 1500°F, then T(0) = T(L) = 1500°F.

So applying T(0) = 1500 = (-q/(4k))*0 + C*0 + D → D = 1500.

Then T(L) = 1500 = (-q/(4k)) L² + C L + 1500.

Subtracting 1500 from both sides:

0 = (-q/(4k)) L² + C L → C L = (q/(4k)) L² → C = (q/(4k)) L.

So the temperature profile is:

T(x) = (-q/(4k)) x² + (q/(4k) L) x + 1500

Simplify:

T(x) = (q/(4k)) (L x - x²) + 1500

At the center of the plate, which is at x = L/2.

So T_center = (q/(4k)) (L*(L/2) - (L/2)^2) ) + 1500

Simplify inside the parentheses:

L*(L/2) = L²/2

(L/2)^2 = L²/4

So L*(L/2) - (L/2)^2 = L²/2 - L²/4 = L²/4.

Thus,

T_center = (q/(4k)) * (L²/4) + 1500 = (q L²)/(16 k) + 1500.

Now, plugging in the numbers:

q = 627,000 Btu/hr-ft³

L = 0.0417 ft

k = 2.8 Btu/hr-ft-°F

So,

T_center = (627000 * (0.0417)^2) / (16 * 2.8) + 1500.

First, compute (0.0417)^2 ≈ 0.00173889.

Multiply by 627000: 627000 * 0.00173889 ≈ 1086.86.

Divide by (16 * 2.8) = 44.8.

So 1086.86 / 44.8 ≈ 24.26 °F.

Then add 1500: 1500 + 24.26 ≈ 1524.26°F.

But wait, that's not matching any of the options. The options are up to around 1565°F. Hmm, did I make a mistake in calculations?

Let me check the units again. Oh wait, q is in Btu/hr-ft³, k in Btu/hr-ft-°F, so the units should work out.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating q. Let me recalculate q.

Earlier, I calculated the power as 6400 watts, which is 6400 * 3.41214 ≈ 21821.5 Btu/hr. Then, the volume is 0.0417 ft * 0.333 ft * 2.5 ft ≈ 0.03475 ft³.

So q = 21821.5 Btu/hr / 0.03475 ft³ ≈ 627,000 Btu/hr-ft³. That seems correct.

Wait, but maybe I should have used the power per unit volume correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the current density and find the heat generation per unit volume differently.

Wait, another approach: The current I is 533.33 A. The cross-sectional area A is 0.0417 ft * 0.333 ft ≈ 0.0139 ft². So current density J = I / A ≈ 533.33 / 0.0139 ≈ 38,300 A/ft².

The power per unit area is J² * rho. So (38300)^2 * 1.25e-4 ohm-ft. Let me compute that.

38300^2 = 1.467e9. Multiply by 1.25e-4: 1.467e9 * 1.25e-4 = 1.83375e5 W/ft². Because rho is in ohm-ft, and J is A/ft², so J² * rho gives W/m²? Wait, maybe I'm mixing units.

Wait, actually, power per unit area (W/m²) is J² * rho. Let me make sure the units are correct.

J is A/m², rho is ohm*m. So J² * rho would be (A²/m^4) * ohm*m = (V^2/(m^2)) * ohm * m = V^2/(m^3) * m = V^2/(m^2) * (ohm*m) → No, wait, perhaps better to compute in SI units.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the power per unit volume as (I^2 * rho) / (A^2). Because power is I² R. R = rho * L / A. So P = I² (rho L / A). Then, power per unit volume is P/(L*A*t), where t is thickness.

Wait, no, perhaps better to compute it as:

Power per unit volume, q = (I² rho) / (A * t), where A is the cross-sectional area, and t is the length along which the current flows. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, using the formula q = (I^2 * rho) / (A * t), where A is the cross-sectional area (thickness * width), and t is the length of the conductor. Wait, perhaps that's better.

So, I = 533.33 A.

rho = 1.25e-4 ohm-ft.

A = 0.0417 ft * 0.333 ft ≈ 0.0139 ft².

t = 2.5 ft.

So q = (533.33^2 * 1.25e-4) / (0.0139 * 2.5).

Compute numerator: 533.33^2 ≈ 284,444. Then 284,444 * 1.25e-4 ≈ 35.5555.

Denominator: 0.0139 * 2.5 ≈ 0.03475.

So q ≈ 35.5555 / 0.03475 ≈ 1023.45 Btu/hr-ft³.

Wait, that's different from the earlier 627,000. So which one is correct?

Wait, maybe I messed up the unit conversions earlier. Let me redo this part carefully.

First, calculate the power in watts: P = I^2 R = (533.33)^2 * 0.0225 ≈ 284,444 * 0.0225 ≈ 6400 W.

Convert 6400 W to Btu/hr: 6400 * 3.41214 ≈ 21,821.5 Btu/hr.

Volume V = 0.0417 ft * 0.333 ft * 2.5 ft ≈ 0.03475 ft³.

So q = 21,821.5 / 0.03475 ≈ 627,000 Btu/hr-ft³. That's what I did earlier.

But using the other method, I got 1023.45 Btu/hr-ft³. There's a discrepancy, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let me compute using SI units to see.

Current I = 533.33 A.

Resistivity rho = 1.25e-4 ohm-ft. Convert to ohm-m: 1 ft = 0.3048 m, so 1.25e-4 ohm-ft = 1.25e-4 * 0.3048 ≈ 3.8e-5 ohm-m.

Length L = 2.5 ft = 0.762 m.

Cross-sectional area A = 0.0417 ft * 0.333 ft = 0.0139 ft² = 0.0139 * 0.3048² ≈ 0.0139 * 0.0929 ≈ 0.00129 m².

Resistance R = rho * L / A = 3.8e-5 ohm-m * 0.762 m / 0.00129 m² ≈ (3.8e-5 * 0.762) / 0.00129 ≈ (2.9e-5) / 0.00129 ≈ 0.0225 ohms. That matches the earlier calculation.

Power P = I² R = (533.33)^2 * 0.0225 ≈ 6400 W, which is 6400 J/s.

Convert to Btu/hr: 6400 * 3.41214 ≈ 21,821.5 Btu/hr.

Volume V in m³: 0.0417 ft * 0.333 ft * 2.5 ft ≈ 0.03475 ft³ = 0.03475 * 0.0283168 ≈ 0.000982 m³.

q = P / V = 21,821.5 Btu/hr / 0.000982 m³ ≈ 22,230,000 Btu/hr/m³.

Wait, that's 22.23e6 Btu/hr/m³. Wait, earlier when I did the other method, I got 1023 Btu/hr-ft³, which is about 1023 * (3.53957 ft³/m³) ≈ 3623 Btu/hr/m³. That's way lower than 22 million. So I must have made a mistake in the other calculation.

Wait, perhaps I confused the units in the second method. Let me try again.

Wait, in the second approach, I used:

q = (I² rho) / (A * t)

But I think I messed up the units. Let's make sure all units are consistent.

I is in amps, rho in ohm-ft, A in ft², t in ft.

So, I² rho is (A^2) * (ohm-ft).

A * t is (ft²) * (ft) = ft³.

So q would be (A^2 * ohm-ft) / ft³ = (A² ohm) / ft².

Wait, that doesn't make sense because power per unit volume should be in W/m³ or Btu/hr-ft³.

Hmm, maybe that approach isn't correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to stick with the first method where q is 627,000 Btu/hr-ft³.

So, going back, with q = 627,000 Btu/hr-ft³, L = 0.0417 ft, k = 2.8 Btu/hr-ft-°F.

So,

T_center = 1500 + (q * L²) / (16k )

Compute L²: 0.0417^2 ≈ 0.00173889.

Multiply by q: 627000 * 0.00173889 ≈ 1086.86.

Divide by (16 * 2.8) = 44.8.

So 1086.86 / 44.8 ≈ 24.26.

Thus, T_center ≈ 1500 + 24.26 ≈ 1524.26°F.

But looking at the options, the closest is H: 1520°F, but that's not exact. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should have used T_center = 1500 + (q * L²)/(8k), because in some derivations, the formula is T_center = T_end + (q L²)/(8k).

Wait, let me rederive the solution.

The ODE is d²T/dx² = -q/k.

Integrate once: dT/dx = (-q/k)x + C.

Apply boundary conditions: At x=0, T=1500, so dT/dx at x=0 is 0 (if the ends are kept at same temp, but wait, no, in this case, the ends are at 1500, but the heat generation would cause a temperature rise in the center. So perhaps the boundary conditions are T(0) = 1500 and T(L) = 1500.

Wait, that would mean the temperature starts at 1500, increases to a maximum in the center, then decreases back to 1500. So the first derivative at x=0 would be positive, and at x=L would be negative. Hmm, but that complicates the integration.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model it as a plate with uniform heat generation, with both ends at 1500°F. So, the general solution is T(x) = (q/(2k)) x² - (q/(2k)) L x + (T_avg), where T_avg is the average of the two end temperatures. Since both ends are at 1500, T_avg is 1500.

Wait, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, the solution can be written as T(x) = (q/(2k)) (x)(L - x) + T_avg.

So T(x) = (q/(2k)) x(L - x) + 1500.

At the center, x = L/2.

So T_center = (q/(2k)) (L/2)(L - L/2) + 1500 = (q/(2k)) (L²/4) + 1500 = (q L²)/(8k) + 1500.

Ah, so perhaps I should have used 8k in the denominator, not 16k. That would double the temperature increase.

So using q = 627000, L = 0.0417 ft, k=2.8.

Compute (627000 * (0.0417)^2) / (8 * 2.8) + 1500.

(0.0417)^2 ≈ 0.00173889.

627000 * 0.00173889 ≈ 1086.86.

Divide by (8 * 2.8) = 22.4.

1086.86 / 22.4 ≈ 48.53.

So T_center ≈ 1500 + 48.53 ≈ 1548.53°F.

Looking at the options, F is 1549°F, which matches closely. So the answer should be F.
</think>

To determine the temperature at the center of the carbon steel plate, we analyze the heat generation and conduction under steady-state conditions. The plate has dimensions of 1/2 in. thick, 4 in. wide, and 2.5 ft long, with a resistivity of \( \rho = 1.25 \times 10^{-4} \, \Omega \cdot \text{ft} \) and a thermal conductivity of \( k = 2.8 \, \text{Btu/hr-ft}^\circ \text{F} \). A potential of 12 volts is applied, and the lateral faces are maintained at 1500°F.

### Step 1: Calculate Resistance and Current
The resistance \( R \) of the plate is given by:
\[
R = \rho \cdot \frac{\text{length}}{\text{cross-sectional area}}
\]
The cross-sectional area \( A \) is:
\[
A = \text{thickness} \cdot \text{width} = 0.0417 \, \text{ft} \cdot 0.333 \, \text{ft} \approx 0.0139 \, \text{ft}^2
\]
Thus:
\[
R = 1.25 \times 10^{-4} \cdot \frac{2.5}{0.0139} \approx 0.0225 \, \Omega
\]
The current \( I \) is:
\[
I = \frac{V}{R} = \frac{12}{0.0225} \approx 533.33 \, \text{A}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Heat Generation
The power \( P \) generated is:
\[
P = V \cdot I = 12 \cdot 533.33 \approx 6400 \, \text{W}
\]
Convert to \( \text{Btu/hr} \):
\[
P \approx 6400 \cdot 3.41214 \approx 21,821.5 \, \text{Btu/hr}
\]
The volume \( V \) of the plate is:
\[
V = \text{thickness} \cdot \text{width} \cdot \text{length} = 0.0417 \cdot 0.333 \cdot 2.5 \approx 0.03475 \, \text{ft}^3
\]
The volumetric heat generation \( q \) is:
\[
q = \frac{P}{V} = \frac{21,821.5}{0.03475} \approx 627,000 \, \text{Btu/hr-ft}^3
\]

### Step 3: Temperature Profile
For steady-state 1D conduction with uniform heat generation, the temperature at the center \( x = L/2 \) is:
\[
T_{\text{center}} = 1500 + \frac{q \cdot L^2}{8k}
\]
Substitute \( q = 627,000 \, \text{Btu/hr-ft}^3 \), \( L = 0.0417 \, \text{ft} \), and \( k = 2.8 \, \text{Btu/hr-ft}^\circ \text{F} \):
\[
T_{\text{center}} = 1500 + \frac{627,000 \cdot (0.0417)^2}{8 \cdot 2.8}
\]
\[
(0.0417)^2 \approx 0.00173889, \quad 627,000 \cdot 0.00173889 \approx 1086.86
\]
\[
\frac{1086.86}{8 \cdot 2.8} \approx 48.53
\]
\[
T_{\text{center}} \approx 1500 + 48.53 \approx 1548.53^\circ \text{F}
\]

### Final Answer:
The temperature at the center of the plate is approximately **1549°F**, corresponding to option **F**.

F
