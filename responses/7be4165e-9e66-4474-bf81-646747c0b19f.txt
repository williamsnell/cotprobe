Okay, so I've got this question about capacitors and voltage over time. Let me think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember what I learned in my circuits class.

The problem says we have a capacitor with capacitance C = 10^-6 farads. The initial voltage across it is 1 volt, so at time t=0, u_c(0) = 1 V. We need to find the voltage u_c(t) for t ≥ 0 when the current through it is i_C(t) = cos(10^6 t). The options are A through J, each giving a different function.

Hmm, I remember that for capacitors, the current through the capacitor is related to the rate of change of voltage. The formula is i_C = C * du_c/dt. So, the current is the derivative of the voltage multiplied by the capacitance. So, I can write that as:

i_C(t) = C * (du_c/dt)

Given that, I can rearrange this to find du_c/dt = i_C(t) / C.

In this case, i_C(t) is cos(10^6 t), and C is 1e-6 F. So, du_c/dt = cos(10^6 t) / 1e-6 = 1e6 cos(10^6 t). So, the derivative of the voltage is 1e6 times the cosine function.

To find u_c(t), I need to integrate this derivative with respect to time. The integral of 1e6 cos(10^6 t) dt. Let me think about how to integrate that.

The integral of cos(k t) dt is (1/k) sin(k t) + constant. So here, k is 1e6. So, integrating 1e6 cos(1e6 t) dt would be:

1e6 * (1/(1e6)) sin(1e6 t) ) + constant = sin(1e6 t) + constant.

Wait, that seems right. So du_c/dt is 1e6 cos(1e6 t), and integrating gives u_c(t) = sin(1e6 t) + constant.

But wait, we also have the initial condition u_c(0) = 1 V. Let me plug t=0 into the expression to find the constant.

At t=0: u_c(0) = sin(0) + constant = 0 + constant = 1. So the constant is 1. Therefore, the voltage is u_c(t) = 1 + sin(1e6 t).

Wait a minute, but let me double-check. The integral of cos is sin, yes. So the integration step is correct.

Looking at the options, option B is 1 + sin(1e6 t). That matches what I got. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything.

Wait, another thought: sometimes when integrating, especially with AC signals, the phase can matter. But in this case, since the current is given as cos(1e6 t), and the integration leads directly to sin(1e6 t), which is just a phase shift of 90 degrees relative to the cosine. So that seems correct.

Wait, but wait another second. The initial condition is at t=0, u_c(0) = 1. So when I plug t=0 into the integrated function, I get 1 + sin(0) = 1 + 0 = 1, which matches. So yes, the constant is indeed 1.

So the voltage should be 1 + sin(1e6 t), which is option B.

Wait, but in the options, option B is 1 + sin(1e6 t), and option A is 1 + cos(1e6 t). So I think I did it right. Because integrating cos gives sin.

Another way to check: If the current is cos(ωt), then the voltage across the capacitor would be the integral of (1/C) i_C dt, which is (1/C) ∫cos(ωt) dt. That's (1/C)(1/ω) sin(ωt) + constant. Since ω here is 1e6, that's (1/(1e-6 * 1e6)) sin(1e6 t) + constant. Wait, 1e-6 * 1e6 is 1, so it's 1 * sin(1e6 t) + constant. So that's sin(1e6 t) + constant, which again gives u_c(t) = 1 + sin(1e6 t), as before.

Wait, wait, no! Wait a second. Let me redo the integration because I might have made a mistake. The current is i_C = cos(1e6 t), and du_c/dt = i_C / C. So du_c/dt is [cos(1e6 t)] / 1e-6. That's 1e6 cos(1e6 t). So integrating 1e6 cos(1e6 t) with respect to t.

Let me let u = 1e6 t, so du/dt = 1e6 → dt = du/(1e6). So ∫1e6 cos(u) * (du/(1e6)) ) = ∫cos(u) du = sin(u) + C = sin(1e6 t) + C. So yes, that's correct. So u_c(t) = sin(1e6 t) + C.

Applying u_c(0)=1: 1 = sin(0) + C → C=1. So u_c(t) = 1 + sin(1e6 t). So option B.

Wait, but wait another thing. Could I have made a mistake in the sign? Because sometimes the integral of cosine is sine, but the derivative of sine is cosine, but integrating cos gives sin. So yeah, correct.

Alternatively, I could have thought about it in terms of phasors or differential equations, but I think the approach is solid.

The voltage across the capacitor is determined by integrating the current through it. Given the current \( i_C(t) = \cos(10^6 t) \) and capacitance \( C = 10^{-6} \, \text{F} \), the derivative of the voltage is \( \frac{du_c}{dt} = \frac{i_C(t)}{C} = 10^6 \cos(10^6 t) \). Integrating this gives \( u_c(t) = \sin(10^6 t) + \text{constant} \). Using the initial condition \( u_c(0) = 1 \, \text{V} \), the constant is found to be 1. Thus, \( u_c(t) = 1 + \sin(10^6 t) \), which corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
