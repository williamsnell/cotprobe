Okay, so I've got this question about electroplating silver onto a spoon. Hmm, I remember from chemistry that electroplating involves using electrical current to deposit a metal onto another object. The question is asking how much silver is deposited when the spoon is plated for 20 minutes at 0.50 amperes. The options are from A to J, with various grams.

First, I think I need to use Faraday's laws of electrolysis. Right, Faraday's first law states that the amount of substance deposited is proportional to the amount of electricity used. So I should calculate the total charge passed and then relate that to the amount of silver.

Wait, the formula I remember is Q = I * t, where Q is charge in coulombs, I is current in amperes, and t is time in seconds. So the time here is 20 minutes. Let me convert that to seconds: 20 * 60 = 1200 seconds.

So Q = 0.50 A * 1200 s = 600 coulombs. Okay, that's the total charge.

Next, I think I need to find out how much silver corresponds to that charge. Silver has a molar mass of about 107.87 g/mol. But wait, electrons are involved too. Silver is deposited when it gains electrons, so I need to find the number of moles of electrons and then use that to find moles of Ag.

The electrochemical reaction for silver plating is probably: Ag⁺ + e⁻ → Ag. So each mole of Ag requires one mole of electrons. So the number of moles of electrons is Q divided by Faraday's constant.

Faraday's constant is 96485 C/mol. So moles of electrons = 600 C / 96485 C/mol ≈ 0.006217 moles.

Since each mole of electrons produces one mole of Ag, the moles of Ag deposited is also 0.006217 mol.

Now, the mass of Ag deposited is moles multiplied by molar mass: 0.006217 mol * 107.87 g/mol ≈ 0.669 grams. Wait, let me calculate that more accurately.

0.006217 * 107.87 = let's see: 0.006 * 107.87 is about 0.647, and 0.000217 * 107.87 is approximately 0.0234. Adding those gives around 0.670 grams. Looking at the options, J is 0.671 gm, which is very close. Maybe I should double-check my calculations.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the exact value of the molar mass. Silver's molar mass is roughly 107.87 g/mol, so that's correct. Let me recalculate the moles:

600 / 96485 = 0.0062175 mol e⁻. So moles of Ag is same as electrons, 0.0062175 mol. Multiply by 107.87: 0.0062175 * 107.87 ≈ 0.670 g. So the closest option is J: 0.671 gm. That makes sense.

To determine how much silver is deposited during electroplating, we apply Faraday's laws of electrolysis. The total charge \( Q \) is calculated using \( Q = I \times t \), where \( I = 0.50 \, \text{A} \) and \( t = 20 \, \text{minutes} = 1200 \, \text{seconds} \). Thus, \( Q = 0.50 \times 1200 = 600 \, \text{C} \).

Next, using Faraday's constant (\( 96485 \, \text{C/mol} \)), the moles of electrons (\( n \)) are \( n = \frac{Q}{F} = \frac{600}{96485} \approx 0.006217 \, \text{mol} \). Since each mole of electrons deposits one mole of silver, the moles of silver deposited are also \( 0.006217 \, \text{mol} \).

The mass of silver is then calculated using the molar mass of silver (\( 107.87 \, \text{g/mol} \)):  
\[
\text{Mass} = n \times \text{Molar Mass} = 0.006217 \times 107.87 \approx 0.670 \, \text{g}.
\]

The closest option to this value is **J: 0.671 gm**.
