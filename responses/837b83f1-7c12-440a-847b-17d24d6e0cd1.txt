Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out how many ways I can color a loop of 5 vertices using 3 colors, and the condition is that no two adjacent vertices can have the same color. Hmm, I remember this is a graph coloring problem, specifically for a cycle graph with 5 nodes. 

Wait, the loop part means it's a cycle, right? So it's a closed chain where the first and last vertices are also adjacent. That complicates things a bit because in a straight line (a path graph), the counting is different. For a cycle, I think the formula is a bit different than for a straight line.

I recall that for a cycle graph with n vertices and k colors, the number of proper colorings is given by (k-1)^n + (-1)^n * (k-1). Let me think if that's correct. So for n=5 and k=3, it would be (3-1)^5 + (-1)^5*(3-1) = 2^5 + (-1)*2 = 32 - 2 = 30. Wait, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Maybe I should approach it step by step.

Alternatively, I can think about it as a permutation problem. For the first vertex, I have 3 color choices. The next vertex can't be the same as the first, so 2 choices. The third can't be the same as the second, so another 2 choices. The fourth can't be the same as the third, so 2 again. The fifth vertex is tricky because it's adjacent to both the fourth and the first. So, if the fifth is different from the fourth and the first, how many choices do we have?

Wait, let's model this as a recurrence relation. For a cycle, the number of colorings is equal to the number of colorings for a line (path) minus the cases where the first and last are the same color. Or maybe it's better to use inclusion-exclusion.

Alternatively, I remember that the number of proper colorings for a cycle graph is (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1). Let me double-check that. For n=3, a triangle, with 3 colors, it should be 3! = 6. Plugging into the formula: (2)^3 + (-1)^3 * 2 = 8 - 2 = 6. That works. Another test: for n=4, a square, with 3 colors. The formula gives (2)^4 + (1)*2 = 16 + 2 = 18. Wait, is that correct? Let me think: for a square, each vertex has 3 choices, but adjacent can't be same. So for a line of 4, it's 3*2*2*2=24. But since it's a cycle, the first and last can't be same. So 24 minus the cases where first and last are same. How many are those? Let's see: for the first vertex, 3 choices. Second: 2. Third: 2. Fourth: must be different from third and first. So if first and third are same, then fourth has 2 options. If first and third are different, then fourth has 1 option. Hmm, maybe this is getting too complicated.

Wait, another approach: using the formula for the chromatic polynomial of a cycle graph. The chromatic polynomial for a cycle Cn is (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1). So for n=5 and k=3, it's (2)^5 + (-1)^5*(2) = 32 - 2 = 30. So the number of colorings is 30. That would correspond to option C.

But let me think again. Maybe I should calculate it step by step. For a cycle with 5 vertices, each adjacent pair must be different. So it's a proper 3-coloring of C5.

Another way: using recurrence relations. For a path graph Pn, the number of colorings is k*(k-1)^(n-1). For a cycle, you have to subtract the colorings where the first and last are the same. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, the number of colorings for a cycle is equal to the number of colorings for a line minus the number of colorings where the first and last are the same. So for a line of 5, it's 3*2^4 = 48. But the cycle has to ensure that the first and last are also different. So how many colorings of the line have the first and last the same?

To compute that, let's fix the first and last to be the same color. So first vertex has 3 choices. Last vertex must be same as first, so 1 choice. The second vertex has 2 choices (not same as first). Third vertex: can't be same as second. Fourth vertex: can't be same as third. The fifth is fixed as same as first, but must also not be same as fourth.

Wait, this seems a bit tangled. Maybe I can model it as a recurrence. Let me denote a_n as the number of colorings for a line of n vertices where the first and last are the same, and b_n where they are different.

But for a cycle, we need the first and last to be different, so the number of colorings is b_n. For a line of n, the total is a_n + b_n = 3*2^(n-1).

We can find a recurrence for a_n and b_n. For a line of length n:

a_n = b_{n-1}, because if the first and last are same, the (n-1)th must be different from first, so the number is equal to the number of colorings where the first n-1 have first and (n-1)th different.

b_n = (a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}) ) * 1, because the nth can be any color except the (n-1)th. Wait, no: for b_n, the nth must be different from (n-1)th and also different from first. So it's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to stick with the formula. The chromatic polynomial for a cycle is (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1). So for n=5 and k=3, it's 2^5 - 2 = 30. So the answer should be 30, which is option C.

The problem involves determining the number of ways to color a cycle graph with 5 vertices using 3 colors such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. This is a graph coloring problem for a cycle graph \( C_5 \).

For a cycle graph \( C_n \) with \( k \) colors, the number of proper colorings is given by the chromatic polynomial formula:

\[
(k-1)^n + (-1)^n \cdot (k-1)
\]

Substituting \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 3 \):

\[
(3-1)^5 + (-1)^5 \cdot (3-1) = 2^5 - 2 = 32 - 2 = 30
\]

Thus, the number of valid colorings is **30**, corresponding to option **C**.
