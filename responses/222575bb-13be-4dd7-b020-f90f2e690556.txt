Okay, so I have this question about the nickname for the Federal National Mortgage Association. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I'll try to think it through. I remember that there are a couple of government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) involved in the mortgage market. One of them is Freddie Mac, right? I think Freddie Mac is actually the nickname for the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. Wait, but the question is about the Federal National Mortgage Association.

Oh, wait! I think the Federal National Mortgage Association is actually known as Fannie Mae. Yeah, that sounds familiar. Fannie Mae is the nickname because "Fannie" comes from the first letters of the words. So, Fannie Mae would be the correct answer. Let me check the options again. Option B is Fannie Mac, and option H is Freddie Mac. I think Freddie Mac is a different company, the one that was established after Fannie Mae. So the answer should be B: Fannie Mac.
