Okay, so I have this problem here about Coach Wu and his soccer balls. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Coach Wu has a total of 30 soccerballs. Out of these, 9 are white. That means the remaining soccer balls must be of other colors. Wait, the remaining ones are either blue, pink, or green. Hmm, so I need to find out how many green soccer balls there are.

Alright, let's break it down. The total number of soccerballs is 30. If 9 are white, then the number of non-white balls is 30 minus 9. Let me do that subtraction: 30 - 9 equals 21. So there are 21 soccerballs that are either blue, pink, or green.

The problem also says that the remaining soccer balls are equally divided among the three colors: blue, pink, and green. So, these 21 balls are split into three equal groups. To find out how many of each color there are, I should divide 21 by 3. Let me do that: 21 รท 3 equals 7. Wait, so each color has 7 balls. But wait, that doesn't seem right because 7 times 3 is 21, which matches the remaining balls after the white ones. 

Wait, but looking at the options, I see option C is 9, which is the number of white balls. Option D is 10, E is 11, and so on. So if each color has 7, then green would be 7. But looking at the options, I don't see 7 as one of the choices except for option I. Wait, the options are A:14, B:20, C:9, D:10, E:11, F:12, G:21, H:39, I:7, J:15.

So 7 is option I. But wait, the problem says the remaining are one of three colors, but it's possible I misread something. Let me check again.

Wait, the problem says the remaining soccer balls are one of three different colors. So that means the remaining 21 are divided equally among blue, pink, and green. So 21 divided by 3 is indeed 7. So green would be 7. So the answer should be I:7. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation.

Total balls:30. White:9. Remaining:21. Divided equally into three colors, so each has 7. So yes, green is 7. Therefore, the answer is I.

The total number of soccerballs is 30, with 9 being white. Subtracting the white balls leaves 21, which are equally divided among blue, pink, and green. Dividing 21 by 3 gives 7 green soccerballs.

Answer: I
