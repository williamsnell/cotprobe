Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to calculate Personal Income (PI) and Disposable Personal Income (DPI) using the given data. Let me start by recalling what these terms mean.

Personal Income is the total income that all individuals receive before any taxes are taken out. It includes things like wages, salaries, proprietors' income, interest, dividends, and transfer payments. Disposable Personal Income is what's left after subtracting personal taxes from Personal Income.

Looking at the data provided, I need to identify all the components that go into Personal Income. Let me list them out:

- Compensation of employees: 642
- Proprietor's income: 68
- Rents: 40
- Interest: 20
- Dividends: 6
- Transfer payments: 127
- Social security taxes: 46 (I think this is a tax, so it might be subtracted)
- Personal taxes: 116

Wait, no, I think I might be mixing things up. Let me clarify. In the income approach, Personal Income (PI) is computed as:

PI = Total income of individuals = Compensation of employees + Proprietor's income + Rents + Interest + Dividends + Transfer payments

But wait, transfer payments are actually payments made by the government to individuals, so they should be included in PI. Also, things like social security taxes and personal taxes are deductions from PI to get DPI.

So, PI includes all the components that go to individuals before taxes. Let me add them up:

Compensation of employees: 642
Proprietor's income: 68 → total so far 710
Rents: 40 → 750
Interest: 20 → 770
Dividends: 6 → 776
Transfer payments: 127 → 776 + 127 = 903

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check other sources. Oh, wait, PI also includes net income from self-employment, which is proprietors' income, but I think I already included that. Also, I might have missed some components or included some incorrectly.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. The standard formula is:

PI = Wages + Salaries + Proprietors' Income + Rent + Interest + Dividends + Transfer Payments.

So adding those up:

642 (compensation, which is wages and salaries) + 68 (proprietors) + 40 (rents) + 20 (interest) + 6 (dividends) + 127 (transfer payments).

Let me calculate that:

642 + 68 = 710
710 + 40 = 750
750 + 20 = 770
770 + 6 = 776
776 + 127 = 903

So PI is 903 billion. But wait, none of the options are 903. The options are A through J, with the highest being I:869 and J:634. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should look at the income approach from the national accounts. The income approach includes all sources of income earned by factors of production. So PI is the sum of all income going to households, which includes:

- Wages and salaries (compensation of employees): 642
- Proprietors' income: 68
- Rents: 40
- Interest: 20
- Dividends: 6
- Transfer payments: 127

So that's 642 + 68 = 710, +40=750, +20=770, +6=776, +127=903. So PI is 903.

But wait, the options don't have 903. Let me check the data again. Oh, maybe I'm supposed to calculate DPI instead. Because the question says to calculate PI and DPI.

So if PI is 903, then DPI is PI minus personal taxes. Personal taxes are 116.

So DPI = 903 - 116 = 787. But that's also not an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in including transfer payments. Transfer payments are payments from the government to individuals, but in national income accounting, transfer payments are not counted as part of GDP because they don't represent production. So when calculating PI, transfer payments are added because they are part of personal income, even though they don't come from production.

Wait, but maybe I should consider that PI is calculated after adding transfer payments. So my initial approach was correct. But since the options don't include 903, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate GDP first and then derive PI from that. Let me try that.

The expenditure approach to GDP is C + I + G + NX. But the question is about the income approach, so let me calculate GDP using the income approach.

GDP (Y) = Total Income = Compensation of employees + Proprietors' income + Rents + Interest + Dividends + Net exports + Indirect business taxes + Undistributed corporate profits + Depreciation + Capital consumption allowance + Government purchases of goods and services + Net private domestic investment.

Wait, no. The income approach includes all factors of production, so:

Y = Wages + Salaries + Proprietors' income + Rents + Interest + Dividends + Transfer Payments (from businesses to households) + Net exports.

Wait, no, transfer payments are from the government, not businesses. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, the income approach adds up all the factors' incomes:

Y = Compensation of employees + Proprietors' income + Rents + Interest + Dividends + Transfer payments + Indirect business taxes + Undistributed corporate profits + Depreciation.

Wait, no, indirect business taxes are part of the cost of production, so they are included in GDP as part of the income approach. Let me list all the components:

From the given data:

Compensation of employees: 642
Proprietors' income: 68
Rents:40
Interest:20
Dividends:6
Transfer payments:127
Social security taxes:46 (these are taxes on labor income, so they are part of the cost of production)
Indirect business taxes:101
Corporate income taxes:35
Corporate profits:81
Undistributed corporate profits:40
Depreciation:95
Government purchases:233
Net exports:2
Net private domestic investment:57

Wait, Net private domestic investment is I_net, which is I - depreciation. So I = I_net + depreciation. So I_net is 57, so total investment I is 57 + 95 = 152.

But for the income approach, we need to sum up all the factor incomes. So:

Y = Compensation + Proprietors + Rents + Interest + Dividends + Transfer payments + Net exports + Indirect business taxes + Depreciation + Corporate profits + Undistributed corporate profits.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The income approach includes:

1. Wages and salaries (compensation of employees): 642
2. Proprietors' income: 68
3. Rents:40
4. Interest:20
5. Dividends:6
6. Net exports:2
7. Indirect business taxes:101
8. Depreciation:95
9. Corporate profits (including undistributed): 81 + 40 = 121
10. Transfer payments:127
11. Social security taxes:46 (these are taxes on labor income, so they are part of the cost of production, not income)

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me try to calculate Y correctly.

The income approach formula is:

Y = Total Factor Payments + Net Exports

Total Factor Payments (TFP) = Compensation of employees + Proprietors' income + Rents + Interest + Dividends

So TFP = 642 +68 +40 +20 +6 = 776.

Then, add Net Exports (2) to get Y = 776 + 2 = 778. But that seems low, and the options don't include that.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing some components. Let me check: TFP also includes Transfer Payments? No, transfer payments are not part of TFP because they are transfers, not earned income. So TFP is just the sum of the factor incomes: 642 +68 +40 +20 +6 = 776.

Then, Y = TFP + Net Exports = 776 + 2 = 778. But that can't be right because the options don't have that. Also, I think I'm forgetting some other components like indirect business taxes and depreciation, which are part of GDP but not TFP.

Wait, no. Indirect business taxes and depreciation are part of the cost of production, so they are included in GDP. So perhaps Y = TFP + Net Exports + Indirect Business Taxes + Depreciation + Corporate Profits + Undistributed Corporate Profits + Government Purchases?

No, that doesn't make sense. Let me clarify.

The income approach adds up all the factor payments (TFP) plus the taxes and adjustments to get GDP. So:

Y = TFP + Net Exports + Indirect Business Taxes + Depreciation + Corporate Profits + Undistributed Corporate Profits.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me look up the formula.

The income approach formula is:

GDP = Compensation of employees + Proprietors' income + Rents + Interest + Dividends + Net exports + Indirect business taxes + Depreciation + Corporate profits + Undistributed corporate profits + Government purchases.

Wait, no. Government purchases are part of the expenditure approach, not the income approach. Wait, no, in the income approach, government purchases are included as part of the income they generate. So perhaps:

Y = TFP (776) + Net Exports (2) + Indirect Business Taxes (101) + Depreciation (95) + Corporate Profits (81 + 40=121) + Transfer Payments (127) + Social Security Taxes (46) + Government Purchases (233)?

No, that can't be right because that would double count some things.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should focus back on calculating Personal Income (PI) and DPI, which are part of the question.

As I thought earlier, PI is the sum of all income received by individuals, which includes:

- Compensation of employees: 642
- Proprietors' income:68
- Rents:40
- Interest:20
- Dividends:6
- Transfer payments:127

So PI = 642 +68 +40 +20 +6 +127 = 903.

Then, DPI = PI - Personal Taxes (116) = 903 - 116 = 787.

But the options don't have 787. The closest is option C: 811, but that's higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in including transfer payments. Transfer payments are payments from the government to individuals, so they are part of PI. But maybe I should also include social security taxes as part of PI? No, social security taxes are deductions from wages, so they reduce disposable income.

Wait, let me check the formula again. PI is:

PI = Wages + Salaries + Proprietors' Income + Rent + Interest + Dividends + Transfer Payments.

So that's correct. So PI is 903. Then DPI is 787.

But the options don't have that. Maybe I'm miscalculating something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for something else. Let me read the question again.

The question says to arrange the national income figures in a consolidated income statement with revenues and allocations (expenses). Then, calculate PI and DPI.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate Y first using the income approach, then derive PI from there.

Let me try to calculate Y using the income approach.

Y = Total Factor Payments + Net Exports.

Total Factor Payments = Compensation + Proprietors + Rents + Interest + Dividends = 642 +68 +40 +20 +6 = 776.

Net Exports = 2.

So Y = 776 + 2 = 778. That's the GDP.

But then, how does that relate to PI? PI is part of GDP, so maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the sum of all revenues and expenses in the income statement, which would be GDP. But the options don't have 778.

Wait, maybe I should add all the given figures to get the total GDP.

Let me sum all the given data:

C:660, Transfer:127, Rents:40, D:95, Social Security Taxes:46, Interest:20, Proprietor's Income:68, Net Exports:2, Dividends:6, Compensation:642, Indirect Taxes:101, Undistributed Profits:40, Personal Taxes:116, Corporate Taxes:35, Corporate Profits:81, Government Purchases:233, Net Private Investment:57, Personal Saving:60.

Adding all these:

660 +127=787

787+40=827

827+95=922

922+46=968

968+20=988

988+68=1056

1056+2=1058

1058+6=1064

1064+642=1706

1706+101=1807

1807+40=1847

1847+116=1963

1963+35=1998

1998+81=2079

2079+233=2312

2312+57=2369

2369+60=2429.

Wait, that can't be right because GDP shouldn't be that high. I must be adding all the components without considering which ones should be included. This approach is wrong because many of these items are not part of GDP.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to calculating PI and DPI.

PI = 903

DPI = 903 - 116 = 787.

But since 787 isn't an option, maybe I made a mistake in including transfer payments. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the sum of PI and DPI, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the sum of all revenues and expenses, which would be GDP. Let me try calculating GDP using the expenditure approach to see if I can cross-verify.

Expenditure approach: C + I + G + NX.

From the data:

C (Personal consumption):660

I (Net private domestic investment):57

G (Government purchases):233

NX (Net exports):2

So Y = 660 +57 +233 +2 = 952.

Hmm, that's different from the 778 I got earlier using the income approach. There's a discrepancy here, which suggests I'm making a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps Net private domestic investment (I_net) is 57, but total investment I is I_net + depreciation. Depreciation is 95, so I =57 +95=152.

Then Y = C + I + G + NX =660 +152 +233 +2 = 1047.

But that still doesn't align with the income approach calculation.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing some components in the income approach. Let me try again.

In the income approach, Y = Total Factor Payments + Net Exports + Indirect Business Taxes + Depreciation + Corporate Profits + Undistributed Profits + Transfer Payments + Social Security Taxes + Government Purchases.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because some of these are taxes and others are part of production.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should focus solely on calculating PI and DPI as per the given data, regardless of GDP.

So PI is 903, DPI is 787. But the options don't have this. Let me check the options again.

Options are A:776, B:741, C:811, D:857, E:820, F:705, G:792, H:681, I:869, J:634.

None of these match 787. So perhaps I made a mistake in adding the components for PI.

Wait, perhaps I should exclude transfer payments from PI. But no, transfer payments are part of PI because they are income received by households.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for something else. Perhaps the sum of all revenues and expenses, which would be GDP, but as I calculated earlier, using the expenditure approach, it's 1047, which isn't an option either.

Wait, maybe I should consider that Net exports are 2, which is a positive number, so it's exports minus imports. But that shouldn't affect PI.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate PI using the formula:

PI = (Total Income of the Country) - (Business Taxes + Undistributed Corporate Profits + Depreciation) + Transfer Payments.

Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Another approach: The total income in the economy includes all the components listed. To find PI, which is the income received by individuals, I should sum the components that go to households.

So:

- Compensation of employees: 642 (wages and salaries)
- Proprietors' income:68
- Rents:40
- Interest:20
- Dividends:6
- Transfer payments:127

Adding these: 642 +68=710 +40=750 +20=770 +6=776 +127=903.

So PI is 903, as before.

Then DPI = PI - Personal Taxes (116) = 787.

But since that's not an option, perhaps the question is asking for something else. Maybe the sum of PI and DPI, but that would be 903 +787=1690, which isn't an option either.

Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to calculate the sum of all revenues, which would be the sum of all the given figures except for the expenses. But I'm not sure.

Wait, looking back at the question, it says to arrange the figures into a consolidated income statement with revenues and allocations (expenses). So perhaps I need to separate the figures into revenues and expenses.

Revenues would include things like taxes, profits, etc., and expenses would include things like purchases, transfers, etc.

But I'm not sure how to proceed with that. Maybe the question is asking for the total income and expenses, which would sum up to GDP.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the sum of all the given figures, which would be the total income in the economy. Let me try adding them all:

C:660

Transfer:127

Rents:40

D:95

Social Security Taxes:46

Interest:20

Proprietor's Income:68

Net Exports:2

Dividends:6

Compensation:642

Indirect Taxes:101

Undistributed Profits:40

Personal Taxes:116

Corporate Taxes:35

Corporate Profits:81

Government Purchases:233

Net Private Investment:57

Personal Saving:60

Adding all these:

660 +127=787

787+40=827

827+95=922

922+46=968

968+20=988

988+68=1056

1056+2=1058

1058+6=1064

1064+642=1706

1706+101=1807

1807+40=1847

1847+116=1963

1963+35=1998

1998+81=2079

2079+233=2312

2312+57=2369

2369+60=2429.

But that can't be right because GDP shouldn't be that high. Clearly, I'm adding components that shouldn't all be included in GDP.

I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess. Since my calculation for DPI was 787, which isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the sum of PI and DPI, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, looking at the options, the closest to 787 is option C:811. But I don't see how that would be correct. Alternatively, maybe I missed some components in PI.

Wait, perhaps I should include Net exports in PI, but that doesn't make sense because net exports are part of the expenditure approach.

Alternatively, maybe I should include government purchases in PI, but that's part of G in the expenditure approach, not PI.

I'm not making progress here. I think I'll have to go with the initial calculation of PI as 903 and DPI as 787, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option A:776, which is the sum of the factor payments without transfer payments. But I'm not sure.
</think>

The question involves calculating Personal Income (PI) and Disposable Personal Income (DPI) using the given data. PI is the sum of all income received by individuals, including compensation, proprietors' income, rents, interest, dividends, and transfer payments. DPI is calculated by subtracting personal taxes from PI.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Personal Income (PI):**
   - Compensation of employees: $642
   - Proprietors' income: $68
   - Rents: $40
   - Interest: $20
   - Dividends: $6
   - Transfer payments: $127

   Adding these components:
   \[
   PI = 642 + 68 + 40 + 20 + 6 + 127 = 903 \, \text{(billion dollars)}
   \]

2. **Disposable Personal Income (DPI):**
   - Personal taxes: $116

   Subtracting personal taxes from PI:
   \[
   DPI = 903 - 116 = 787 \, \text{(billion dollars)}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The calculated values for PI and DPI are $903 billion and $787 billion, respectively. However, since $787 is not among the provided options, the closest plausible answer based on the given choices is **A: 776**, which corresponds to the sum of factor payments without transfer payments.

ANSWER: A
