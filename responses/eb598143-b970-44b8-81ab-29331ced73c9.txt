Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is asking which site has monumental earthworks with concentric ridges in a semicircle dating back around 3,500 years ago. The options are A through J, each a different historical site.

First, I need to break down the key elements of the question. The main points are: monumental earthworks, concentric ridges in a semicircle, and the time period is about 3,500 years ago.

Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Caral. I know Caral is an ancient city in Peru, one of the earliest Andean civilizations. They had pyramids and were known for their urban planning, but I'm not sure about earthworks with concentric ridges. I think their structures were more stone-based, so maybe not.

Option B: Chichen Itza. This is a famous Mayan city in Mexico. It's known for structures like the pyramid of Kukulkan. I don't recall earthworks with concentric ridges being a feature there. More about stone pyramids and ball courts.

Option C: The Parthenon. That's in Athens, Greece. It's a temple, not an earthwork. It's made of marble, so no, that's not it.

Option D: Machu Picchu. This is the Incan citadel in Peru. It's built on mountains with stonework, terraces, and walls. I don't think it's an earthwork with ridges; more about the stonemasonry and the layout on the mountain.

Option E: Angkor Wat. Located in Cambodia, it's a massive temple complex. It's built with sandstone and laterite, surrounded by moats and enclosed by a large wall. I don't think it's known for earthworks with concentric ridges, though it's a monumental structure.

Option F: The Great Pyramids of Giza. These are in Egypt. They're massive stone pyramids, not earthworks. So probably not the answer.

Option G: The Colosseum. That's in Rome, an amphitheater. It's a large structure, but again, made of stone and concrete, not an earthwork with ridges.

Option H: Poverty Point. This rings a bell. I think Poverty Point is a pre-Columbian earthwork in the United States, specifically in Louisiana. From what I remember, it's known for its concentric ridges arranged in a semicircle. It's a large mound complex, and the ridges are part of its construction. The age is also important here. I believe Poverty Point dates back to around 3,500 years ago, which fits the time frame in the question.

Option I: Gobekli Tepe. This is in Turkey and is one of the world's oldest temples, dating back to around 9,000 BCE. It's known for its massive stone pillars and is a monumental structure, but I don't think it's an earthwork with concentric ridges. It's more about the megalithic structures.

Option J: Stonehenge. Located in England, it's a prehistoric stone circle. It's a monumental structure, but it's made of stones, not earthworks, and while it's ancient, I don't think it has concentric ridges in a semicircle.

So, putting it all together, the key is identifying which site has earthworks (not stone structures), with concentric ridges in a semicircle, and from around 3,500 years ago. That points to Poverty Point (Option H). I'm pretty confident about that.

The correct answer is H: Poverty Point.
