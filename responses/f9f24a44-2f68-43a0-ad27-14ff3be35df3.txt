Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about Carens's main conclusion. The question is asking what Carens concludes, and there are ten options labeled A through J. I'm a bit new to this topic, so I need to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that Joseph Carens is a political philosopher who has written about immigration and liberal egalitarianism. Liberal egalitarianism, as I understand it, is a political philosophy that emphasizes equality and individual freedom. So, Carens is probably discussing how this philosophy applies to immigration policies.

Looking at the options, I need to see which one aligns with Carens's arguments. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: "liberal egalitarian objections to anticosmopolitanism do not succeed." Anticosmopolitanism refers to a view that prioritizes the nation-state over global concerns. So, if Carens is saying that objections to anticosmopolitanism from liberal egalitarians don't work, that might mean he thinks anticosmopolitanism is justified. But I'm not sure if that's his main point.

Option B: "Carens believes that liberal egalitarianism supports closed borders and strict immigration policies." Wait, that doesn't sound right. I remember Carens arguing in favor of more open borders, so this might be the opposite of his view.

Option C: "Carens argues that liberal egalitarianism is rooted in anti-immigration sentiments." No, I think Carens is more pro-immigration, so this seems incorrect.

Option D: "egalitarianism is founded on sentiments of envy and is therefore unjustified." That seems off; I don't recall Carens attacking egalitarianism on these grounds. He's more about how it applies to immigration.

Option E: "Carens concludes that liberal egalitarianism inherently supports anti-cosmopolitanism." If anything, I think he argues against anti-cosmopolitanism, supporting a more cosmopolitan view.

Option F: "Carens concludes that egalitarianism is a justifiable sentiment, irrespective of immigration policies." Not sure about this one. It seems too vague and doesn't directly address the main conclusion about immigration.

Option G: "Carens asserts that liberal egalitarianism does not have a clear stance on immigration policies." I don't think this is right because Carens does take a stance, arguing for more openness.

Option H: "liberal egalitarianism should almost always press for more openness toward immigrants and refugees." This rings a bell. I remember Carens making the case that liberal egalitarians should support open borders because of their commitment to equality and individual rights.

Option I: "Carens concludes that egalitarianism inherently supports only closed border policies." No, this is the opposite of what I think Carens argues.

Option J: "Carens suggests that liberal egalitarianism always supports the concept of open borders." This is close, but I think Carens allows for some restrictions, so it's not an absolute "always."

So, putting it together, the main conclusion seems to be that liberal egalitarianism supports more openness. Option H says "should almost always press for more openness," which fits better than J, which uses "always." Therefore, H is the most accurate.

The answer is H.
