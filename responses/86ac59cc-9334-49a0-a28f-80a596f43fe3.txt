Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about electric fields and displacement fields in different media. The question gives me some information about the two media and the electric field in the first medium, E₁. I need to find E₂ and the corresponding D fields for both media.

First, let me parse the information given. Medium 1 has a relative permittivity k₁ = 1.5 and extends to the left of the yz-plane. Medium 2 has k₂ = 2.5 and is on the right side of the yz-plane. The electric field in Medium 1, E₁, is given as (x̂2 - ŷ3 + ẑ) V/m.

I remember that the displacement field D is related to the electric field E by D = ε₀ E + P, where P is the polarization. But in linear isotropic materials, D = ε₀ ε_r E, where ε_r is the relative permittivity. So, D = ε₀ k E, since k is the relative permittivity here. That's because ε = ε₀ ε_r, so D = ε E = ε₀ k E.

Wait, no, actually, the relation is D = ε₀ ε_r E, so yes, D = ε₀ k E because k is ε_r.

So for Medium 1, D₁ = ε₀ k₁ E₁. Given E₁ is (2 x̂ - 3 ŷ + ẑ) V/m, so let's compute that.

k₁ is 1.5, so D₁ would be ε₀ * 1.5 * (2 x̂ -3 ŷ + ẑ) = ε₀ (3 x̂ -4.5 ŷ + 1.5 ẑ). So looking at the options, I can check which D₁ matches this.

Looking at the options:

Option A: D₁ = ε₀ (1.5 x̂ -3 ŷ + 1 ẑ). Wait, our calculation is 3 x̂ -4.5 ŷ +1.5 ẑ. So A doesn't match.

Option B: D₁ is ε₀ (2 x̂ -4.5 ŷ + 1.5 ẑ). Hmm, 2 x̂ instead of 3. So no.

Wait, no, wait. Let me recheck. E₁ is (2 x̂ -3 ŷ + ẑ). So 2 x̂, -3 ŷ, 1 ẑ.

So D₁ is k₁ * ε₀ * E₁, which is 1.5 * (2, -3, 1) = (3, -4.5, 1.5). So yes, D₁ is (3 x̂ -4.5 ŷ + 1.5 ẑ) multiplied by ε₀.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option I: D₁ = ε₀ (3 x̂ -4.5 ŷ + 1.5 ẑ). So that's correct.

Wait, checking option I: D₁ is ε₀ (x̂3 - \^{y}4.5 + ẑ1.5). So yes, that matches.

So D₁ is correctly given in option I as D₁ = ε₀ (3x̂ -4.5 ŷ + 1.5 ẑ).

Now, what about E₂? The problem doesn't give E₂ directly. I think we need to use the boundary conditions at the interface between the two media. The interface is the yz-plane (x=0). So the tangential components of E must be continuous across the boundary, while the normal component of D must be continuous. Wait, no, wait: the normal component of D is continuous, and the tangential components of E are continuous. Let me make sure.

The boundary conditions for electromagnetic fields are:

1. The tangential components of E are continuous across the boundary. So E_tangential1 = E_tangential2.

2. The normal component of D is continuous. So D_normal1 = D_normal2.

So, given that, let's find E₂.

First, let's find the tangential components of E₁. The tangential components are the components parallel to the surface, which is the yz-plane (x=0). So the tangential components are the y and z components. The normal component is the x component.

Wait, no, the normal vector to the yz-plane is along x. So the normal component of E is E_x, and the tangential components are E_y and E_z.

Wait, no, wait: E's normal component is along x, since the surface is x=0.

Wait, no, the electric field has components in x, y, z. The interface is at x=0, so the normal direction is x. So, for E, the normal component is E_x, and the tangential components are E_y and E_z.

So, continuity of E_tangential:

E_{1,y} = E_{2,y}

E_{1,z} = E_{2,z}

That is, E_{1y} = -3, so E_{2y} must be -3. Similarly, E_{1z} is 1, so E_{2z} is 1.

Now, for D. The normal component of D is continuous. D is given by D = ε₀ k E.

So, D_{1x} = ε₀ k₁ E_{1x} = ε₀ (1.5)(2) = 3 ε₀.

D_{2x} = ε₀ k₂ E_{2x}.

Since D is continuous across the interface, D_{1x} = D_{2x}.

So, 3 ε₀ = ε₀ k₂ E_{2x}.

k₂ is 2.5, so:

3 ε₀ = ε₀ * 2.5 * E_{2x}

Cancel ε₀ from both sides:

3 = 2.5 E_{2x}

So E_{2x} = 3 / 2.5 = 1.2.

So E₂ has components (1.2 x̂, -3 ŷ, 1 ẑ).

Wait, no, because E₁ is in medium 1 (left of yz-plane, x<0), so E₂ is in medium 2 (right of yz-plane, x>0). But the components I found for E₂ are (1.2 x̂, -3 ŷ, 1 ẑ). Wait, but the electric field in medium 2 would have x component E2x = 1.2, but wait, the medium is on the right side, so x positive. But the direction of E doesn't necessarily depend on the medium's position, only on the fields.

Wait, but the problem didn't specify the direction of E, only the components. So E₂'s x component is 1.2, y component is -3, z component is 1.

So E₂ is (1.2 x̂ -3 ŷ + ẑ) V/m.

Now, looking at the options, which one has E₂ as (1.2 x̂ -3 ŷ + ẑ)? Let's check each option's E₂.

Looking at the options:

Option A: E2 = x̂0.6 - ŷ2 + ẑ. So 0.6 x̂, -2 ŷ, 1 ẑ. Doesn't match.

Option B: E2 = x̂1.3 - ŷ3 + ẑ. 1.3 x̂, -3 ŷ, 1 ẑ. Close, but x is 1.3, not 1.2.

Option C: E2 = x̂1.8 - ŷ4 + ẑ. No, y is -4, not -3.

Option D: E2 = x̂1.4 - ŷ3.5 + ẑ. Not matching.

Option E: E2 = x̂1.1 - ŷ3 + ẑ. 1.1 x̂, -3 ŷ, 1 ẑ. Close to 1.2, but not exact.

Option F: E2 = x̂1.2 - ŷ2 + ẑ. 1.2 x̂, but y is -2, not -3.

Option G: E2 = x̂1 - ŷ3 + ẑ. 1 x̂, -3 ŷ, 1 ẑ. Close but x is 1, not 1.2.

Option H: E2 = x̂1.5 - ŷ2.5 + ẑ. No.

Option I: E2 = x̂1.2 - ŷ3 + ẑ. Yes! That's exactly what we calculated.

Wait, option I: E2 is (1.2 x̂ -3 ŷ + ẑ) V/m.

So E2 in option I matches.

Now, let's check the D fields.

We already found D₁ in option I is correct: ε₀(3 x̂ -4.5 ŷ + 1.5 ẑ).

Now, D₂ is ε₀ k₂ E₂. E₂ is (1.2 x̂ -3 ŷ + ẑ). So:

E₂x = 1.2, E₂y = -3, E₂z =1.

So D₂x = ε₀ * 2.5 * 1.2 = ε₀ * 3.

D₂y = ε₀ * 2.5 * (-3) = ε₀ * (-7.5).

D₂z = ε₀ * 2.5 *1 = ε₀ * 2.5.

So D₂ = ε₀ (3 x̂ -7.5 ŷ +2.5 ẑ).

Looking at option I: D₂ is ε₀ (3 x̂ -7.5 ŷ +2.5 ẑ). Yes, that's exactly what we have.

So option I has E₂ as (1.2 x̂ -3 ŷ + ẑ) and D₂ as (3 x̂ -7.5 ŷ +2.5 ẑ) multiplied by ε₀.

Looking back at the options, option I is:

E₁ = x̂2 - ŷ3 + ẑ,

E₂ = x̂1.2 - ŷ3 + ẑ,

D₁ = ε₀(x̂3 - ŷ4.5 + ẑ1.5),

D₂ = ε₀(x̂3 - ŷ7.5 + ẑ2.5).

Yes, that matches our calculations.

The electric field in Medium 1 is given as \( \mathbf{E}_1 = (2\hat{x} - 3\hat{y} + \hat{z}) \, \text{V/m} \), and the relative permittivities are \( k_1 = 1.5 \) and \( k_2 = 2.5 \) for Media 1 and 2, respectively. The displacement field in each medium is calculated using \( \mathbf{D} = \epsilon_0 k \mathbf{E} \). For Medium 1, \( \mathbf{D}_1 = \epsilon_0 (3\hat{x} - 4.5\hat{y} + 1.5\hat{z}) \).

Using boundary conditions, the tangential components of \( \mathbf{E} \) are continuous, so \( E_{1,y} = E_{2,y} = -3 \) and \( E_{1,z} = E_{2,z} = 1 \). The normal component of \( \mathbf{D} \) is continuous, leading to \( D_{1,x} = D_{2,x} \). Solving \( 3\epsilon_0 = 2.5\epsilon_0 E_{2,x} \) gives \( E_{2,x} = 1.2 \). Thus, \( \mathbf{E}_2 = (1.2\hat{x} - 3\hat{y} + \hat{z}) \, \text{V/m} \).

For Medium 2, \( \mathbf{D}_2 = \epsilon_0 (3\hat{x} - 7.5\hat{y} + 2.5\hat{z}) \). Comparing with the options, only **Option I** matches all calculated values for \( \mathbf{E}_1 \), \( \mathbf{E}_2 \), \( \mathbf{D}_1 \), and \( \mathbf{D}_2 \).
