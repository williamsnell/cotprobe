Alright, so I've got this problem here about sampling rates, and I'm a bit rusty on my signal processing, but let me try to think it through step by step. Okay, the question is asking for the minimum sampling rate required to accurately capture the signal x(t) such that y(t) equals x(t). The given function is x(t) = 10 cos(20π - π/4) - 5 cos(50π t). Hmm, wait, that first cosine term looks a bit odd. Let me parse it correctly.

Wait, the function is written as 10 cos(20π - π/4). Is that correct? Because the way it's written, it's 20π minus π/4, which is a phase shift. But wait, cosine is an even function, so cos(θ) = cos(-θ). Also, cos(A - B) can be expanded using trigonometric identities. Let me check that. Alternatively, maybe I'm misreading it. Oh wait, perhaps it's a typo, and the intended function is x(t) = 10 cos(20π t - π/4) -5 cos(50π t). Because as it stands, the first term is just a constant, not a function of t. Because without the t in the argument, the first term is a time-independent value, which would be a DC offset. That might complicate things, but perhaps that's the case. Alternatively, maybe I misread it.

Wait, let me read it again. The problem states x(t) = 10 cos(20π - π/4) -5 cos(50π t). So the first cosine term is indeed a constant because it doesn't have a 't' in its argument. So 20π minus π/4 is just a phase value, making the first term a constant. So x(t) is a constant minus a cosine function of t. That's a bit unusual, but okay.

Wait, but if the first term is a constant, then the signal x(t) is a sum of a constant and a cosine function. So for sampling, the key is to capture the highest frequency component in the signal. The minimum sampling rate must be at least twice the highest frequency in the signal (Nyquist rate). So I need to find the highest frequency present in x(t).

Let's break down x(t). The first term is 10 cos(20π - π/4). Let me compute that value. 20π is about 62.83, and π/4 is about 0.7854. So 20π - π/4 is approximately 62.83 - 0.7854 ≈ 62.0456 radians. The cosine of that is a number between -1 and 1, so 10 times that would be a number between -10 and 10. So the first term is a constant offset, let's say it's C, where C = 10 cos(62.0456). Let me compute that. Using a calculator, cos(62.0456) is approximately cos(62.0456) ≈ cos(62.0456 - 20π) because 20π is 62.8319. Wait, 20π is 62.8319, so 62.0456 is 20π - 0.7863. So cos(20π - 0.7863) = cos(-0.7863) because cosine is even, so cos(θ) = cos(-θ). So cos(0.7863) is approximately cos(π/4) since π/4 is about 0.7854, so cos(π/4) is √2/2 ≈ 0.7071. So 10 * 0.7071 ≈ 7.071. So the first term is approximately 7.071, a constant.

The second term is -5 cos(50π t). So that's a cosine function with frequency f. Let's find the frequency. The argument is 50π t, which is 2π * f * t. So 2π f = 50π → f = 25 Hz. So the second term is a cosine wave at 25 Hz.

Wait, but wait, the first term is a constant, so it doesn't have any frequency component. So the highest frequency in x(t) is 25 Hz. Then, according to the Nyquist theorem, the sampling rate must be at least twice the highest frequency. So 2*25 = 50 Hz. So the minimum sampling rate is 50 Hz. Looking at the options, option D is 50. So the answer should be D.

But wait, another thought: sometimes when you have multiple sinusoids, you have to consider if any of them could alias when sampled. Wait, but in this case, x(t) is a sum of a DC offset and a single sinusoid at 25 Hz. So the highest frequency is 25 Hz, so sampling at 50 Hz should suffice. So the minimum sampling rate is 50 Hz, which is option D.

The minimum sampling rate required to accurately capture the signal \( x(t) \) is determined by the Nyquist rate, which is twice the highest frequency component in the signal. The given function is \( x(t) = 10 \cos(20\pi - \pi/4) - 5 \cos(50\pi t) \). The first term is a constant (approximately 7.071) and does not contribute to the frequency. The second term, \( -5 \cos(50\pi t) \), has a frequency of \( 25 \, \text{Hz} \). Applying the Nyquist theorem, the minimum sampling rate is \( 2 \times 25 = 50 \, \text{Hz} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

D: 50 Hz.
