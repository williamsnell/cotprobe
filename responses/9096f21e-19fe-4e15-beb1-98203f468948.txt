Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about capacitors. Hmm, let's see. The question says a 3-microfarad capacitor is connected in series with a 6-microfarad capacitor. Then, a 300-volt potential difference is applied across them. I need to find the total energy stored in both capacitors and choose the correct option from A to J.

Wait, I remember that when capacitors are connected in series, their capacitances don't just add up directly like in parallel. Oh right, the reciprocal of the total capacitance is the sum of the reciprocals of each capacitor. So the formula is 1/C_total = 1/C1 + 1/C2.

So here, C1 is 3 microfarads and C2 is 6 microfarads. Let me plug those in. So 1/C_total = 1/3 + 1/6. Let me calculate that. 1/3 is approximately 0.333, and 1/6 is about 0.166. Adding them together gives 0.5. So the reciprocal of that is 2. So C_total is 2 microfarads. Wait, no, wait. Wait, because 1/3 is 0.333... and 1/6 is 0.166..., so 0.333 + 0.166 is 0.5, so 1/C_total = 0.5, so C_total is 2 microfarads. Oh, right, because 1/(0.5) is 2. So the total capacitance is 2 microfarads.

Wait, but wait, I should make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because sometimes I get confused between series and parallel. Oh right, in series, the formula is 1/C_total = 1/C1 + 1/C2. And in parallel, it's C_total = C1 + C2. So yeah, in series, 3 and 6 microfarads give 2 microfarads total. Got it.

Next, the voltage is 300 volts. So the energy stored in a capacitor is given by U = ½ C V². But wait, that's the energy for a single capacitor. But here, the capacitors are in series, so I can't just calculate each one's energy separately like in parallel. Hmm, I think in series, the same voltage isn't across each capacitor. Instead, the voltage is shared between them. Or wait, no. Wait, in series, the same charge is stored on each capacitor, but the voltage across each is different.

Wait, so when capacitors are in series, the total voltage is the sum of the individual voltages. So V_total = V1 + V2. And since they have the same charge Q, because in series, the charge is the same. So Q = C1 V1 = C2 V2. So maybe I can find each voltage and then compute their energies separately and add them up.

Alternatively, since I know the total capacitance is 2 microfarads, and the total voltage is 300 V, the total energy would be ½ * C_total * V_total². Wait, is that correct? Because the total energy stored in a combination of capacitors should be the same as the energy stored in the equivalent capacitor connected to the same voltage. Hmm, that makes sense because energy is a state function, so the way they're connected shouldn't affect the total energy when the same voltage is applied.

Wait, no. Wait, I think that's true for capacitors in parallel because the voltage is the same across each, but in series, the voltage is split. So I'm a bit confused now. Let me think again.

Wait, energy stored in a capacitor is U = ½ C V². If I have a combination in series, the equivalent capacitance is lower, so the energy stored would be based on that. Let me compute it using both methods to see if I get the same result.

First method: calculate the equivalent capacitance C_total = 2 microfarads. Then the total energy U = ½ * C_total * V². So that would be ½ * 2e-6 F * (300)^2.

Let me compute that. 300 squared is 90,000. So ½ * 2e-6 * 90,000 = (1e-6) * 90,000 = 0.09 J. Wait, but 0.09 J is one of the options, option H. But wait, I'm not sure if this is the correct approach here because when capacitors are in series, each one has a different voltage, and the energy stored is the sum of each individual energy.

Alternatively, maybe I should find the charge on each capacitor and then compute each energy and sum them.

Since the capacitors are in series, the charge Q is the same for both. The voltage across each capacitor will be V1 = Q/C1 and V2 = Q/C2. And V1 + V2 = V_total = 300 V.

So, Q/C1 + Q/C2 = 300. Substituting C1=3e-6 F and C2=6e-6 F, we have Q/(3e-6) + Q/(6e-6) = 300.

Simplify that: Q/(3e-6) is (Q * 1e6)/3, and same for the others. Let me compute it as fractions. Let me think of 1/(3e-6) as 1e6/3 and 1/(6e-6) as 1e6/6.

So, Q*(1e6/3 + 1e6/6) = 300.

Combine the terms: 1e6 (1/3 + 1/6) = 1e6 ( (2 + 1)/6 ) = 1e6 * (3/6) )= 1e6 * 0.5 = 5e5.

So, Q * 5e5 = 300. So Q = 300 / 5e5 = 300 / 500,000 = 0.0006 C. So Q is 0.0006 coulombs.

Then, the energy stored in each capacitor is U1 = ½ C1 V1², and U2 = ½ C2 V2². But since V1 = Q/C1 and V2 = Q/C2, let's compute each.

Alternatively, since Q is known, the energy can also be calculated as U = Q²/(2C). So, U1 = (0.0006)^2 / (2 * 3e-6) and U2 = (0.0006)^2 / (2 * 6e-6).

Wait, let me compute U1 first. 0.0006 squared is (6e-4)^2 = 36e-8. Divided by (2 * 3e-6) is 6e-6. So 36e-8 /6e-6 = (36/6) * (1e-8/1e-6) )= 6 * 0.01 = 0.06 J.

Wait no, let me compute that again. 0.0006 is 6e-4. Squared is 36e-8. Then divided by (2 * 3e-6) = 6e-6. So 36e-8 /6e-6 = (36/6) * (1e-8/1e-6) )= 6 * (1e-2) = 0.06 J.

Similarly for U2: 36e-8 divided by (2 * 6e-6) = 12e-6. So 36e-8 /12e-6 = (36/12) * (1e-8/1e-6) )= 3 * 0.01 = 0.03 J.

So total energy U1 + U2 = 0.06 + 0.03 = 0.09 J. Oh, same as before. So that's 0.09 J, which is option H.

Wait, but earlier when I computed using the equivalent capacitance, I also got 0.09 J. So that's the same result. So that's correct.

Alternatively, using the equivalent capacitance, U = ½ * C_total * V². C_total is 2e-6 F, V is 300 V. So ½ * 2e-6 * (300)^2 = (1e-6) * 90,000 = 0.09 J. Same result.

So the total energy is 0.09 J, which is option H.

The problem involves two capacitors (3 μF and 6 μF) connected in series with a 300 V potential difference. To find the total energy stored, we first calculate the equivalent capacitance for the series combination using the formula:

\[
\frac{1}{C_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2}
\]

Substituting \(C_1 = 3 \, \mu\text{F}\) and \(C_2 = 6 \, \mu\text{F}\):

\[
\frac{1}{C_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{6} = 0.5
\]

\[
C_{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{0.5} = 2 \, \mu\text{F}
\]

The total energy stored in the capacitors is given by:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} C_{\text{total}} V^2
\]

Substituting \(C_{\text{total}} = 2 \, \mu\text{F} = 2 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{F}\) and \(V = 300 \, \text{V}\):

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 10^{-6} \times (300)^2
\]

\[
U = 1 \times 10^{-6} \times 90,000 = 0.09 \, \text{J}
\]

Thus, the total energy stored in the two capacitors is **0.09 J**, which corresponds to option H.
