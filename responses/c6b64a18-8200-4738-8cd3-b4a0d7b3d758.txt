Question:

How can mutation and recombination contribute to the process of tissue graft rejection?

Options:

A: Mutation and recombination only occur in B-cells, not affecting T-cell mediated graft rejection.
B: Mutation and recombination during T-cell maturation in the thymus result in cells that recognize foreign antigens, contributing to tissue graft rejection.
C: Mutation and recombination prevent T-cells from recognizing foreign antigens.
D: Mutation and recombination are involved in repairing damaged T-cells, which does not influence graft rejection.
E: Mutation and recombination result in all cells recognizing their own antigens.
F: Mutation and recombination reduce the immune response to foreign antigens.
G: Mutation and recombination increase the chance of graft acceptance by enhancing immune tolerance.
H: Mutation and recombination generate T-cells that cannot differentiate between self and non-self antigens.
I: Mutation and recombination create identical T-cell receptors, reducing variability in immune response.
J: Mutation and recombination lead to the deletion of T-cells that can respond to foreign antigens.

Okay, I have this question about how mutation and recombination contribute to tissue graft rejection. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my immunology, but let's try to think it through.

So, the question is asking about mutation and recombination in the context of tissue graft rejection. I remember that graft rejection often happens because the recipient's immune system sees the donor tissue as foreign. This process involves T-cells, right?

Wait, T-cells are crucial for recognizing antigens. Each T-cell has receptors that recognize specific antigens. These receptors are created through a process involving gene rearrangement, which includes mutation and recombination. So during T-cell maturation in the thymus, these processes happen to generate diverse receptors.

If mutation and recombination during T-cell development create a wide variety of receptors, that means each T-cell can recognize different antigens. But how does that relate to graft rejection?

Well, when a donor's tissue is transplanted, the antigens on the donor cells are foreign to the recipient's immune system. The recipient's T-cells have receptors that can recognize these foreign antigens because of the diversity created by mutation and recombination. So these T-cells will mount an immune response against the graft, leading to rejection.

Looking at the options, option B says that mutation and recombination during T-cell maturation result in cells that recognize foreign antigens, contributing to graft rejection. That makes sense because without these processes, T-cells wouldn't have the diversity needed to detect foreign antigens.

Other options: Option A talks about B-cells, but the question is about tissue graft rejection, which is more about T-cells. Option C says it prevents recognition, which is the opposite of what happens. Option D is about repairing T-cells, but I don't think mutation and recombination are primarily for repair. Option E suggests all cells recognize their own antigens, but that's more about self-tolerance, not foreign antigens. Option F and G seem off; F says reduces immune response, which would decrease rejection, but mutation and recombination actually help the immune response. G talks about increasing graft acceptance, which is not right because rejection is due to recognition. Option H says T-cells can't tell self from non-self, but mutation and recombination are supposed to help them do that. Option I suggests identical receptors, which isn't true as they create diversity. Option J says deletion of responsive T-cells, which is the opposite of what happens; instead, the T-cells that recognize the antigens are the ones that activate.

So, the correct answer should be B because mutation and recombination in T-cell maturation create receptors that recognize foreign antigens, leading to rejection.

The process of mutation and recombination during T-cell maturation in the thymus is essential for generating diverse T-cell receptors. These receptors enable T-cells to recognize foreign antigens, such as those present on a graft, leading to the immune response that results in graft rejection. Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

B: Mutation and recombination during T-cell maturation in the thymus result in cells that recognize foreign antigens, contributing to tissue graft rejection.

Answer: B
