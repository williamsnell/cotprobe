Okay, so I've got this problem here asking how many positive integers k make k! end with exactly 99 zeros in its decimal representation. Hmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 10 is a factor in that factorial. And since 10 is 2*5, the number of trailing zeros is essentially the number of pairs of 2s and 5s in the prime factors of k!. But I also remember that there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the number of 5s determines the number of trailing zeros.

So, the formula to find the number of trailing zeros in k! is to divide k by 5, then by 25, then 125, and so on, until the division results in zero. Then, you sum all those quotients. So, the formula is Z(k) = floor(k/5) + floor(k/25) + floor(k/125) + ... 

The question is asking for how many k's give exactly 99 zeros. So, we need to find all k such that Z(k) = 99.

I think the approach is to find the smallest k where Z(k) is at least 99, and then find the largest k where Z(k) is exactly 99. Then, the number of integers between these two, inclusive, would be the answer.

Wait, but actually, sometimes when you increment k, the number of trailing zeros might stay the same or jump by more than one. So, I need to be careful to find all k where Z(k) equals 99.

Let me start by figuring out what k would give Z(k) = 99. Let's approximate. Since each multiple of 5 contributes at least one zero, and higher powers contribute more.

Let me think: Let's say k is around 50. Then, Z(50) is 12. That's way too low. Hmm, wait, I think I'm mixing up the numbers. Wait, no, 50/5 is 10, 50/25 is 2, so 10+2=12. Yeah, that's correct. So 50 gives 12 zeros. So, 99 is way higher.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula to solve for k when Z(k) = 99.

So, Z(k) = floor(k/5) + floor(k/25) + floor(k/125) + ... = 99.

I can approximate k by ignoring the floors first. So, k/5 + k/25 + k/125 ≈ 99.

Let me compute this as a sum of a geometric series. The sum is k*(1/5 + 1/25 + 1/125 + ...) which is k*(1/5)/(1 - 1/5)) = k*(1/5)/(4/5) )= k*(1/4). So, approximately, k ≈ 4*99 = 396. So, k is around 396.

But that's an approximation. Let me check Z(396). 

Compute floor(396/5) = 79
floor(396/25) = 15
floor(396/125) = 3
floor(396/625) = 0
So sum is 79 +15 +3 = 97. Hmm, that's less than 99.

I must have made a mistake in the approximation. Maybe I should try a higher k.

Wait, perhaps I should use binary search to find the exact k where Z(k) = 99.

Let me try k=400.

Z(400) = floor(400/5) + floor(400/25) + floor(400/125) + floor(400/625) 

= 80 + 16 + 3 + 0 = 99. So, Z(400) = 99.

So, when k=400, it's 99 zeros.

Now, what about k=401? Let's compute Z(401):

floor(401/5)=80
floor(401/25)=16
floor(401/125)=3
floor(401/625)=0
Sum: 80+16+3=99. So, Z(401)=99.

Hmm, same as 400. So, same number of zeros.

Wait, but wait, when does the number of zeros increase? When k is a multiple of 5, right? Because then you add another 5 to the factors. So, let's check k=405.

Z(405) = floor(405/5)=81, floor(405/25)=16, floor(405/125)=3. Sum: 81+16+3=100. So, Z(405)=100.

So, the number of zeros increases at k=405. So, from k=400 to k=404, the number of zeros remains 99.

Wait, let me check k=404.

Z(404) = 404/5=80.8 → 80
404/25=16.16 →16
404/125=3.232 →3
Sum=80+16+3=99.

Similarly, k=403, same as above.

So, from k=400 to k=404, Z(k)=99. Then at k=405, it jumps to 100.

Wait, but wait, what about k=399?

Z(399) = floor(399/5)=79
floor(399/25)=15
floor(399/125)=3
Sum=79+15+3=97.

So, Z(399)=97. So, the next k=400 gives 99? Wait, that can't be right because from 399 to 400, the number of zeros jumps by 2? That seems odd.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation for k=400.

Wait, let me recalculate Z(400):

400/5=80 →80
400/25=16 →16
400/125=3.2 →3
400/625=0.64 →0
Sum=80+16+3=99.

Yes, that's correct. So, Z(400)=99.

But Z(399)=79+15+3=97. So, from 399 to 400, it jumps by 2. So, that suggests that k=400 is the first k where Z(k)=99, but that can't be because the jump is two.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's check k=395.

Z(395)= floor(395/5)=79
floor(395/25)=15
floor(395/125)=3
So, sum=79+15+3=97.

k=396: same as 395, since 396 is not a multiple of 5.

k=397: same.

k=398: same.

k=399: same.

k=400: 80+16+3=99.

Wait, that's a jump of 2. So, how does that happen? Because 400 is a multiple of 25, which contributes an extra 5. So, when k=400, it's a multiple of 25, so it adds two 5s, thus increasing the zero count by two.

So, from 399 (97 zeros) to 400 (99 zeros), it jumps by two. That means that there are no k where Z(k)=98. So, the next zero after 97 is 99. So, the only k where Z(k)=99 would be 400 and 401, 402, 403, 404.

Wait, because as I saw earlier, k=401 also gives 99, because it's not a multiple of 5, so it doesn't add any more 5s beyond what 400 added.

Wait, but wait, when k=400, it's a multiple of 25, so floor(400/25)=16, which is 400/25=16 exactly. Then, when k=401, 401/25=16.04, so floor is 16. So, same as 400.

Similarly, floor(401/5)=80. So, same as 400.

So, Z(401)=80+16+3=99.

Same for 402, 403, 404.

At k=405, it's a multiple of 5, so floor(405/5)=81, so Z(405)=81+16+3=100.

So, the values of k where Z(k)=99 are 400,401,402,403,404. That's five numbers.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought that from k=400 to k=404, Z(k)=99, which would be five values. So, the answer would be 5, which is option E.

But wait, the options are A:20, B:3, C:none, D:4, E:5, F:2, G:7, H:10, I:15, J:1.

So, the answer would be E:5.

But wait, I thought that when k=400, Z(k)=99, and then k=401,402,403,404 also give 99. So, that's five values. So, the answer is five.

Wait, but earlier I thought that from 400 to 404, inclusive, that's five numbers. So, the count is 5, which is option E.

But wait, let me double-check.

Compute Z(400)=99

Z(401)=floor(401/5)=80, floor(401/25)=16, floor(401/125)=3 → sum 99.

Same for 402: same as above.

403: same.

404: same.

405: Z=81+16+3=100.

So, yes, five k's: 400,401,402,403,404.

So, the answer is five, which is option E.

The number of trailing zeros in \( k! \) is determined by the sum \( Z(k) = \left\lfloor \frac{k}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{k}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{k}{125} \right\rfloor + \dots \). We seek \( k \) such that \( Z(k) = 99 \).

Approximating, \( k \) is around \( 4 \times 99 = 396 \). Calculating \( Z(400) \), we find \( Z(400) = 80 + 16 + 3 = 99 \). Checking subsequent values:

- \( Z(401) = Z(402) = Z(403) = Z(404) = 99 \)
- \( Z(405) = 81 + 16 + 3 = 100 \)

Thus, \( k = 400, 401, 402, 403, 404 \) yield exactly 99 zeros. Therefore, there are 5 such integers.
