Okay, so I've got this question about amino acids and carbohydrates. The question is asking what feature of amino acids isn't found in carbohydrates. The options are A through D, each listing different atoms. Let me think this through step by step.

First, I remember that both amino acids and carbohydrates are organic molecules, meaning they're made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. But wait, there's more to it. Amino acids have a specific structure. They have an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). So, besides the usual C, H, and O, amino acids also contain nitrogen because of that amino group. That's a key point.

Carbohydrates, on the other hand, are made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. They don't have nitrogen in their structure. Carbs are things like sugars and starches, right? Their basic units are sugars like glucose, fructose, etc., which don't have any N atoms. So, the presence of nitrogen is something that's unique to amino acids among these options.

Looking at the options, option C is nitrogen atoms. So that's the one that's present in amino acids but not in carbs. Let me just check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something.

Option A: carbon atoms. Both have that, so no.
Option B: oxygen atoms. Both have O as well.
Option D: hydrogen atoms. Yep, both have H too.

So the only one that's not present in carbs is nitrogen. Therefore, the correct answer should be C.

The correct answer is C, nitrogen atoms.
