Question:

If a machine costs initially $1,000,000, lasts for 10 years, and has a scrap value of $100,000 at the end of its life-time, how much depreciation should be taken into account each year in the current accounts? And how is this shown in the capital account?

Okay, so I've got this question about depreciation, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading it carefully. The machine costs $1,000,000 initially and lasts for 10 years, with a scrap value of $100,000 at the end. I need to find out how much depreciation to take each year in the current accounts and how it's shown in the capital account.

Hmm, I remember that depreciation is the process of allocating the cost of an asset over its useful life. The formula I think is (Cost - Scrap Value) divided by the useful life. So, Cost is $1,000,000, Scrap is $100,000, so the total depreciable amount is $900,000. Then, divide that by 10 years, which gives $90,000 per year. Wait, but let me check that.

Wait, no, wait. The scrap value is the value at the end, so the total depreciation should be the cost minus the scrap. So, yes, $1,000,000 - $100,000 = $900,000. Divided by 10 years is $90,000 per year. So that's the depreciation expense each year.

Looking at the options, H is $90,000 per year. So that should be the answer for the first part. Now, regarding the capital account, I think the capital account would show the accumulated depreciation. So each year, the depreciation is added to the accumulated depreciation account, reducing the net book value of the machine each year.

Wait, but the question says, "how is this shown in the capital account?" So, in the capital account, the depreciation would be a credit each year, right? Because when you debit the depreciation expense (which is a current account), you credit the accumulated depreciation account, which is a contra-asset account in the capital section. So the capital account would show the total accumulated depreciation over time.

So putting it all together, the annual depreciation is $90,000, which is option H. And in the capital account, each year you'd have a credit of that amount, building up the total accumulated depreciation to $900,000 over 10 years.

The machine's annual depreciation is calculated as ($1,000,000 - $100,000) / 10 = $90,000. This amount is debited to the current account as an expense and credited to the accumulated depreciation in the capital account.

Answer: H
