Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how Stevenson responds to the objection that his theory doesn't account for an objective, a priori known goodness. Hmm, I remember Stevenson is associated with moral relativism or maybe emotivism. Wait, Stevenson's theory... I think he's part of the naturalist school, but also maybe more on the side of non-cognitivism. 

The objection is saying that Stevenson's theory doesn't handle objective goodness that we know without experience, right? Like, some people think there's a real, objective good that we can know just by thinking, not through empirical evidence. Stevenson must have addressed this in his work.

Let me think about his response. Stevenson probably argues against the idea of a non-naturalistic or a priori good. So maybe he would say that such a property doesn't exist. Or perhaps he claims his theory doesn't need to account for that because it's irrelevant.

Wait, I recall that Stevenson emphasizes the role of emotions and language in moral discourse. He might argue that the idea of an objective, a priori goodness is a misunderstanding. So he might say the objection is based on a misunderstanding of his theory.

Looking at the options, G says he claims the objection is based on a misunderstanding. That sounds right because Stevenson would likely point out that the question assumes a certain metaphysical view that his theory doesn't share. He might argue that his theory doesn't require such a property because he's explaining how moral language works, not whether there's an objective good out there.

Alternatively, maybe he says the objection is irrelevant because his theory is about something else, like the function of moral language, not the nature of goodness. But I think the more precise answer is that he considers the objection a misunderstanding.

So the answer should be option G.

Stevenson responds by claiming that the objection is based on a misunderstanding of his theory. He emphasizes that his approach focuses on the role of emotions and language in moral discourse rather than on the existence of an objective, a priori goodness. Therefore, the objection does not align with his framework.

Answer: G
