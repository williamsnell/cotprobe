Alright, so I have this question about Jaina traditions and the term "ajiva." I'm not super familiar with Jainism, but I know it's an ancient Indian religion. Let me think through this.

The question is asking what "ajiva" means according to Jaina traditions. The options are A through J, with various terms like sound, non-living, non-matter, etc.

First, I remember that in Jainism, there are concepts related to the soul and non-soul. I think "jiva" refers to the soul, which is a living being. So, if "jiva" is the soul, then "ajiva" might be the opposite, meaning non-soul. That would make "ajiva" stand for non-soul. Looking at the options, D is Non-soul. That seems likely.

Wait, but I should double-check. In Jainism, the universe is composed of two fundamental substances: jiva (living beings) and ajiva (non-living substances). So yes, ajiva would encompass everything that isn't a living soul. That includes things like matter, energy, space, and time, but the term itself is more about being non-soul.

So, the answer should be D: Non-soul. But wait, looking at the options again, option B is Non-living. Hmm, non-living is similar but not exactly the same. Because in some contexts, non-living might refer to things that were once alive but are now dead, but in Jainism, ajiva is more about the absence of a soul, so it's not just non-living things but also includes things that never had life, like matter and energy.

Wait, no, actually, in Jaina philosophy, jiva is the soul which is alive, and ajiva is the opposite—anything without a soul, which includes all non-living things. So "ajiva" would be non-living. But I'm a bit confused because I thought it was non-soul. Maybe I'm mixing up terms.

Let me think again. In Jainism, the universe is divided into jiva (soul) and ajiva (non-soul). So, ajiva includes things like matter, space, time, etc., which don't have a soul. So "ajiva" is non-soul, which would make D the answer. But another perspective is that since jiva is living, ajiva would be non-living, which is B.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me look up a mnemonic or a quick definition. Oh, right, in Jainism, "ajiva" refers to non-soul, which includes all non-living elements. So the term is about the absence of a soul rather than just being non-living. Therefore, the correct meaning is non-soul, which is option D.

But wait, the options also include B: Non-living. So I'm a bit stuck. If "ajiva" is non-soul, then it's everything without a soul, which includes both living and non-living? No, that doesn't make sense. Because jiva is the soul, which is the living part. So ajiva is non-soul, meaning non-living things. So perhaps "ajiva" is non-living, which would be B.

Wait, no, in Jaina philosophy, the two categories are jiva (soul) and ajiva (non-soul). So ajiva is non-soul, which includes matter, energy, space, time—anything that doesn't have consciousness. So "ajiva" is non-soul, which is D.

But I'm getting confused because sometimes non-living is used interchangeably, but in this context, it's more precise to say non-soul. So I think the correct answer is D: Non-soul.

The term "ajiva" in Jaina traditions refers to non-soul, which encompasses all elements without consciousness, such as matter and energy.
