Okay, so I've got this question here about finding the atomic weight of electrons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. 

The question states that the mass of an electron is 9.109 × 10^-28 grams. I remember that the atomic weight, or molar mass, is usually the mass of one mole of a substance. So, for electrons, I guess I need to find out what a mole of electrons weighs.

Wait, right, a mole is Avogadro's number of particles, which is 6.022 × 10^23 particles per mole. So if one electron has a mass of 9.109e-28 grams, then a mole would have 6.022e23 electrons. To get the molar mass, I should multiply the mass of one electron by Avogadro's number.

Let me write that down. Molar mass = mass per electron × number of electrons per mole. So that's (9.109e-28 g) × (6.022e23 mol^-1). Let's calculate that.

Multiplying the coefficients: 9.109 × 6.022 ≈ 54.88. Now the exponents: 10^-28 × 10^23 = 10^-5. So putting it together, it's approximately 54.88 × 10^-5 g/mol. Wait, 54.88e-5 is the same as 5.488e-4 g/mol.

Looking at the options, option C is 5.48 × 10^-4 g/mole. That seems to match what I calculated. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, did I get the exponents right? 10^-28 times 10^23 is indeed 10^(-28+23) = 10^-5. Yes, that's correct. And 9.109 times 6.022 is roughly 54.88, so 54.88e-5 is 0.0005488 grams per mole, which is 5.488e-4 g/mol. So option C is the right choice.

I think that's it. No other options seem close. Option E is 6.02e23, which is Avogadro's number itself, so that's not the molar mass. The others are either way off in magnitude.

The atomic weight of electrons is calculated by multiplying the mass of a single electron by Avogadro's number. 

Molar mass = (9.109 × 10^-28 g) × (6.022 × 10^23 mol^-1) ≈ 5.48 × 10^-4 g/mol.

Answer: C
