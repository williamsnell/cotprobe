Question:

Describe shadowing. How is it used in studies ofattention ?

Options:

A: 'Shadowing' is a technique where a subject is asked to memorize a series of words.
B: 'Shadowing' is a technique where a series of words is read to the subject, and the subject is asked to repeat everything she hears out loud.
C: 'Shadowing' is a technique where a subject is asked to observe a person's behavior and mimic their actions.
D: 'Shadowing' is a process where a subject is exposed to visual stimuli and must identify the objects casting shadows.
E: 'Shadowing' is a technique where a subject hears two different conversations in each ear and must focus on one to report back.
F: 'Shadowing' is a technique where a series of words is read to the subject, and the subject is asked to write everything she hears.
G: 'Shadowing' is a technique where a subject is asked to translate a series of words.
H: 'Shadowing' is a cognitive task where a subject is presented with shapes and must draw the corresponding shadows.
I: 'Shadowing' is a method where a subject is asked to listen to a conversation and then provide a summary afterward.
J: 'Shadowing' is a technique where a subject is asked to recognize patterns in shadows to test perceptual abilities.

Okay, so I have this question about shadowing and how it's used in studies of attention. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think carefully.

First, I remember that shadowing is a term used in psychology, specifically in attention studies. I think it's a task where participants have to focus on something while another stimulus is present. Maybe it's about listening and repeating? Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A says shadowing is about memorizing words. I'm not sure, but I think it's more about processing information in real-time rather than memorizing.

Option B: the subject hears words and repeats them out loud. That sounds familiar. I've heard of shadowing tasks where the person has to repeat what they hear immediately. This might be used to test attention because it requires focus on the auditory input.

Option C is about observing and mimicking behavior. That doesn't sound right; that's more observational learning or something else.

Option D talks about visual stimuli and identifying objects by their shadows. I don't think that's the same as the cognitive task related to attention. More like a perceptual test.

Option E mentions two conversations in each ear and focusing on one. Oh, that's the dichotic listening task, right? Like the classic example where you listen to two different messages and can only report back what you heard in one ear. That's a different concept, but maybe related to attention.

Option F is about writing down what's heard. That sounds similar to shadowing but the key is repeating out loud, not writing. So F might be a variation, but I think B is more accurate.

Option G is about translating words. That doesn't fit with what I know about shadowing tasks. More like a language task.

Option H is about drawing shadows of shapes. Again, that's a perceptual or motor task, not related to attention in the cognitive sense.

Option I is listening to a conversation and summarizing. That's more like comprehension, but shadowing is more immediate, like repeating back.

Option J is recognizing patterns in shadows. That seems like a perceptual task, maybe for visual processing, not attention.

So, focusing on the main point: shadowing in attention studies. From what I recall, shadowing typically involves the participant listening to a stream of information and repeating it back immediately. This tests their ability to focus on one task while possibly ignoring other stimuli. So option B fits that description.

Wait, but option E is about two conversations, which is also an attention test but a different method. Shadowing is more about repeating what's heard, not choosing which to focus on. So E is more about selective attention, while B is about the shadowing technique itself.

Therefore, the correct answer should be B.

The correct answer is B. Shadowing involves a subject repeating everything they hear, which is used to study attention by testing focus and processing of auditory information.

Answer: B
