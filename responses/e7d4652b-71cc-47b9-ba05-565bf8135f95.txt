Okay, so I have this question about receptors in the retina and the cochlea, and I need to figure out the main functional difference between them. Let me break it down.

First, I remember that both the retina and cochlea are sensory organs, each responsible for different types of stimuli. The retina detects light, converting it into visual signals, while the cochlea is involved in hearing, detecting sound vibrations.

The question is asking about the functional difference in their receptors. So, I'm thinking about what each receptor does. Retinal receptors are photoreceptors, either rods or cones, which respond to light. Cochlear receptors are hair cells, which respond to mechanical vibrations from sound.

I need to look at the options to see which one highlights the key functional difference. Let's go through each option:

A: Magnitude of resting potentials. I'm not sure if the resting potentials differ significantly in magnitude. Both are sensory cells, but I don't recall this being the main point of difference.

B: Size and structure. While photoreceptors and hair cells have different structures, the question is about function, not structure. So maybe not the best choice.

C: Ability to regenerate. I think that's a factor; I remember that hair cells in the cochlea can't regenerate once damaged, unlike some other parts of the ear, whereas retinal cells, especially cones, can sometimes regenerate, though not as effectively as other cells. But I'm not sure if this is the primary functional difference.

D: Speed of signal transmission. Both have to transmit signals quickly, but I'm not certain if this is the main point. Maybe cones are faster than hair cells, but I'm not sure.

E: Number of axons. Photoreceptors might have more, but I'm not certain. For example, cones connect to bipolar cells, which then connect to ganglion cells. Hair cells connect to the auditory nerve fibers. I don't know if the number of axons is the key difference.

F: Ions involved. Both might use similar ions like sodium and potassium for action potentials, so probably not the answer.

G: Sensitivity to stimuli. Both are very sensitive, but they're sensitive to different types of stimuliâ€”light vs. sound. Maybe not the main point here.

H: Refractory periods. Not sure about this. Both have refractory periods to prevent continuous firing, but I don't think this is the main difference.

I: Location of synapses. Photoreceptors make synapses with bipolar cells, while hair cells connect to the auditory nerve. But I'm not sure if this is the best option.

J: Types of energy transduced. Oh, this seems like a strong candidate. Retinal receptors convert light energy into electrical signals, while cochlear receptors convert mechanical energy (sound vibrations) into electrical signals. That's a fundamental difference in function.

So, putting it all together, the main functional difference is the type of energy they transduce. J seems to be the answer.

The main functional difference between receptors in the retina and the cochlea lies in the types of energy they transduce. Retinal receptors convert light energy into electrical signals, while cochlear receptors transform mechanical energy from sound vibrations into electrical signals. 

Answer: J
