Okay, so I have this question about ethics and Moore's view on the most fundamental question. Let me try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that George Edward Moore was a British philosopher, and he's associated with the Metaethical theory called "Ethical Non-Naturalism." I think he had some specific ideas about the nature of moral statements and whether they can be reduced to other types of statements, like factual or emotional ones.

The question is asking what Moore considers the most fundamental question in ethics. The options are from A to J, so I need to figure out which one aligns with Moore's thoughts.

Looking at the options:

A: How "justice" is to be defined.
B: Whether ethics is a science.
C: Whether morality is subjective.
D: Whether God exists.
E: Whether humans are inherently good or bad.
F: How “good” is to be defined.
G: Whether life is worth living.
H: What is the meaning of life.
I: Whether morality is objective.
J: How "evil" is to be defined.

I recall that Moore's work, especially his book "Principia Ethica," deals a lot with the definition of "good." He argued that "good" is a non-natural property, meaning it's not something that can be defined in terms of other natural properties. He also used the concept of "the open question argument" to show that questions like "Is something good because it promotes happiness?" remain open because "good" isn't synonymous with other terms like happiness.

So, if the question is about the most fundamental issue in ethics, Moore would probably focus on defining "good." That points me toward option F.

Wait, but let me check the other options to be sure. Option I is about whether morality is objective. Moore does believe in the objectivity of ethics, but I think the more specific question he focused on was defining "good." He wasn't just about objectivity; he was about the nature and definition of goodness itself.

Option B is whether ethics is a science. Moore might have discussed this, but I don't think that's the most fundamental question he pinpointed. It's more about the status of ethics rather than the core question.

Option C and I are about subjectivity and objectivity. Moore's position is that moral values are objective, but again, the main focus was on defining "good," not just whether it's subjective or objective.

Options A, E, G, H, J are about specific concepts like justice, human nature, life's worth, etc. While important, I don't think they're the primary focus Moore identified as the most fundamental.

So, putting it all together, the answer should be F: How “good” is to be defined. Because Moore's main contribution was about the definition and nature of "good," arguing against reductionism and for its indefinability in natural terms.

The answer is F.
