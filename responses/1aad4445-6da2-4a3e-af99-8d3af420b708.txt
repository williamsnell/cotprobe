Question:

The Department of Health plans to test the lead level in a specific park. Because a high lead level is harmful to children, the park will be closed if the lead level exceeds the allowed limit. The department randomly selects several locations in the park, gets soil samples from those locations, and tests the samples for their lead levels. Which of the following decisions would result from the type I error?

Options:

A: Keeping the park open when the lead levels are within the allowed limit
B: Closing the park based on a predicted future lead level increase
C: Keeping the park open when the lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit
D: Closing other parks when their lead levels are within the allowed limit
E: Closing the park when the lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit
F: Not testing the lead levels at all and closing the park
G: Keeping other parks open when their lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit
H: Disregarding the test results and keeping the park open regardless of the lead levels
I: Closing the park when the lead levels are within the allowed limit
J: Closing the park based on lead levels from a different park

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about statistics, specifically type I errors. Hmm, I remember that type I errors are when you reject the null hypothesis when it's actually true. In other words, it's a false positive. So the question is about the Department of Health testing lead levels in a park. If there's a type I error, what decision would they make?

Let me break it down. The scenario is that the park will be closed if the lead level exceeds the allowed limit. They take soil samples and test them. The possible decisions are based on whether they make a type I error.

Type I error is when they incorrectly close the park when the lead levels are actually within the limit. Because if the lead levels are okay (null hypothesis is true), but they decide to close it anyway, that's a type I error.

Looking at the options:

A: Keeping the park open when within limit – that's correct action, not an error.
B: Closing based on future prediction – not related to type I.
C: Keeping open when over – that's a type II error.
D: Closing other parks when within – unrelated.
E: Closing when over – correct action.
F: Not testing and closing – irrelevant.
G: Keeping others open when over – not related.
H: Disregarding results – not about type I.
I: Closing when within limit – this is type I error.
J: Closing based on another park's levels – not relevant.

So the answer should be I.

The type I error occurs when the department incorrectly closes the park despite the lead levels being within the allowed limit. This corresponds to option I.

Answer: I
