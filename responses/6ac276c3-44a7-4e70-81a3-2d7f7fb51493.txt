Okay, so I have this NMR question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see, the question is about finding the magnetogyric ratio for 23Na given its NMR frequency in a 750 MHz spectrometer. 

First, I remember that the magnetogyric ratio (gamma) is the ratio of the resonance frequency to the magnetic field strength. The formula I think is gamma = (frequency) / (magnetic field). But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact units here. 

The frequency given is 198.52 MHz, right? And the spectrometer is 750 MHz. I think the magnetic field B0 is related to the spectrometer's frequency. Oh wait, I think the spectrometer's frequency is the proton resonance frequency. So for protons, the Larmor frequency is about 42.58 MHz per tesla. So if the spectrometer is 750 MHz, I can find the magnetic field strength by dividing 750 by that proton frequency.

Let me write that down. B0 = spectrometer frequency / proton Larmor frequency. So B0 = 750 MHz / 42.58 MHz/T. Let me calculate that. 750 divided by 42.58... Hmm, 42.58 times 17 is about 724, because 42.58 *17 = 723.86. Then 750 -723.86 is 26.14 left. 26.14 /42.58 is approximately 0.614. So total B0 is about 17.614 Tesla. Wait, let me double-check that division. Maybe it's easier to just compute 750 / 42.58.

Let me do that more accurately. 42.58 times 17 is 723.86, as before. Subtract that from 750, we get 26.14. Now, 26.14 divided by 42.58 is approximately 0.614. So B0 ≈ 17.614 T. 

Now, the magnetogyric ratio gamma for sodium-23 is the sodium frequency divided by B0. The sodium frequency is 198.52 MHz. So gamma = 198.52 MHz / 17.614 T. Wait, but units: MHz is 1e6 Hz, and Hz is 1/s, so the units would be T^-1 s^-1, which is what the options are in terms of.

Let me compute this division. 198.52 divided by 17.614. Let's see, 17.614 times 11 is about 193.754. Subtract that from 198.52, we get 4.766. Then, 4.766 /17.614 ≈ 0.27. So total is approximately 11.27. But wait, that's in MHz/T. Wait, wait, no, because we're doing (MHz) divided by (T), so the result is in MHz/(T), but since 1 MHz is 1e6 Hz, which is 1e6 s^-1, so the units would be (1e6 s^-1) / T, which is 1e6 T^-1 s^-1. But looking at the options, they have 1e7 T^-1 s^-1, so maybe I missed a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, maybe I messed up the B0 calculation. Let me recheck: the proton Larmor frequency is 42.58 MHz/T, correct? So 750 MHz divided by 42.58 MHz/T gives Tesla. So 750 /42.58 = let me compute that accurately. 42.58 * 17 = 723.86. 750-723.86=26.14. 26.14 /42.58 ≈ 0.614. So total B0 is 17.614 T. That seems right.

So gamma is 198.52 MHz / 17.614 T. Let's compute that as a number. 198.52 /17.614 ≈ let's see, 17.614 *11 = 193.754, so 198.52-193.754=4.766. So 4.766 /17.614 ≈ 0.27. So total is 11.27. But wait, that's 11.27 MHz/T. Since 1 MHz is 1e6 Hz, so 11.27 MHz/T is 11.27e6 Hz/T, which is 1.127e7 T^-1 s^-1. Wait, but looking at the options, the units are x10^7 T^-1 s^-1. So 1.127e7 is 11.27 x1e6, which is 1.127 x10^7. So that would correspond to about 11.27 x10^6, but the options are in x10^7. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, wait, I think I messed up the units. Let me think again. The gamma is (frequency in Hz) divided by (magnetic field in Tesla), which gives units of (Hz/T) or equivalently (s^-1 T^-1), which is the same as the options' units of T^-1 s^-1.

So the sodium frequency is 198.52 MHz, which is 198.52e6 Hz. The B0 is 17.614 T. So gamma = 198.52e6 Hz /17.614 T ≈ let's compute that.

198.52e6 /17.614 ≈ let me do this division. 17.614 *11e6 = 193.754e6. So 198.52e6 -193.754e6 =4.766e6. Now, 4.766e6 /17.614 ≈ 271,000. So total is 11,270,000 Hz/T. That's 11.27e6 Hz/T, which is 1.127e7 Hz/T. So in terms of 1e7, that's 1.127 x10^7 T^-1 s^-1. But looking at the options, option C is 12.61 x10^7, which is about 1.261e8, which is higher. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise calculation. Let me compute 198.52e6 divided by 17.614. Let me compute 198.52 /17.614 first. 

17.614 *11 = 193.754, as before. 198.52 -193.754=4.766. Now, 4.766 /17.614 = approximately 0.27. So 11.27. So 11.27 x1e6 Hz per Tesla. Wait, but that would be 11.27e6 Hz/T, which is 1.127e7 Hz/T. So in the options, the options are in x10^7, so 1.127e7 is 1.127 x10^7. Looking at the options, option I is 5.32 x10^7, which is higher. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating B0. Let me recalculate B0: 750 MHz /42.58 MHz/T. 750 divided by 42.58. Let me compute that accurately. 42.58 *17 = 723.86 as before. 750 -723.86=26.14. Now, 26.14 /42.58 ≈ 0.614. So B0 is 17.614 T. That seems correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 198.52e6 Hz /17.614 T exactly. Let me do that. 198.52e6 /17.614.

Let me compute 198.52e6 ÷17.614. Let's see, 17.614 *11.27 = approximately 198.52e6? Let me compute 17.614 *11.27. 17 *11.27 = 191.59, 0.614*11.27≈6.908, so total ≈198.5, which matches the numerator. So yes, gamma is approximately 11.27e6 Hz/T, which is 1.127e7 Hz/T. 

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is option C:12.61e7, which is way higher. Option A is 20.78e7, which is even higher. Hmm, maybe I messed up the formula. Wait, wait, the magnetogyric ratio is actually gamma = (frequency in Hz) / (B0 in Tesla), so perhaps I should compute it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula gamma = (2pi * frequency) / B0. Wait, no, I think the formula is gamma = (frequency) / (B0/(2pi)), so gamma = 2pi * frequency / B0. Wait, maybe I confused the formula. Let me think: the resonance condition is that the Larmor frequency is (gamma * B0) / (2pi). So gamma = (2pi * frequency) / B0.

Wait, that makes more sense. So maybe I should compute gamma as (2 * pi * frequency) / B0. Let me check that. So gamma = (2 * pi * 198.52e6 Hz) / 17.614 T. Let me compute that.

First, 2 * pi ≈6.2832. So 6.2832 *198.52e6 ≈ let's compute 6 *198.52e6 =1.19112e9, 0.2832*198.52e6≈56.39e6. So total is approximately 1.2474e9 Hz. Now, divide by 17.614 T. So 1.2474e9 /17.614 ≈ let's see, 17.614 *7e7 = 1.233e9. 1.2474e9 -1.233e9=14.4e6. So 14.4e6 /17.614 ≈ 820,000. So total gamma is approximately 70.8e6 Hz/T, which is 7.08e7 Hz/T. That's 7.08 x10^7 T^-1 s^-1. 

Looking at the options, option F is 7.081 x10^7, which matches closely. So the correct answer must be option F.

The magnetogyric ratio (γ) is calculated using the formula:

\[
\gamma = \frac{\text{frequency in Hz}}{\text{magnetic field strength in Tesla}}
\]

Given the frequency of \( 23\text{Na} \) as \( 198.52 \, \text{MHz} \) and the spectrometer's frequency of \( 750 \, \text{MHz} \), the magnetic field strength (\( B_0 \)) is derived from the proton Larmor frequency (\( 42.58 \, \text{MHz/T} \)):

\[
B_0 = \frac{750 \, \text{MHz}}{42.58 \, \text{MHz/T}} \approx 17.614 \, \text{T}.
\]

Next, the sodium frequency is converted to Hz:

\[
198.52 \, \text{MHz} = 198.52 \times 10^6 \, \text{Hz}.
\]

Now, the magnetogyric ratio is calculated:

\[
\gamma = \frac{198.52 \times 10^6 \, \text{Hz}}{17.614 \, \text{T}} \approx 11.27 \times 10^6 \, \text{Hz/T}.
\]

Converting to scientific notation:

\[
\gamma \approx 1.127 \times 10^7 \, \text{Hz/T}.
\]

However, considering the exact calculation, the correct value aligns with option F, \( 7.081 \times 10^7 \, \text{T}^{-1} \text{s}^{-1} \), after accounting for the precise formula involving \( 2\pi \). Thus, the correct answer is:

**F**.
