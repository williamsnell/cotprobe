Okay, so I have this differential equation problem to solve. The equation is given as x dy + (y - x e^x) dx = 0, and I need to find the value of f(2) where y = f(x) satisfies the equation with the initial condition y = 0 when x = 1. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I should probably rewrite the differential equation in a more familiar form. Right now, it's written as x dy + (y - x e^x) dx = 0. I think I can rearrange this to get dy/dx on one side. Let me see: if I move the terms around, it becomes x dy = -(y - x e^x) dx. Then, dividing both sides by x, I get dy = [-(y - x e^x)/x] dx. Simplifying that, dy/dx = -(y/x) + e^x. 

Wait, that looks like a linear differential equation. Yeah, the standard form for a linear DE is dy/dx + P(x) y = Q(x). So let's rearrange the terms to match that. From dy/dx = -(y/x) + e^x, I can write it as dy/dx + (1/x) y = e^x. So P(x) is 1/x and Q(x) is e^x.

Now, to solve this linear DE, I need an integrating factor. The integrating factor mu(x) is usually e^(∫P(x) dx). So, integrating 1/x dx gives ln|x|, and the exponential of that is x. So mu(x) = x.

Next step is to multiply both sides of the DE by the integrating factor. So multiplying through by x gives x dy/dx + y = x e^x. Wait, but the left side should now be the derivative of (mu(x) y), right? Let me check: d/dx (x y) = x dy/dx + y, which matches the left side. So the equation becomes d/dx (x y) = x e^x.

Now, I can integrate both sides with respect to x. The integral of d/dx (x y) dx is just x y. On the right side, I need to integrate x e^x dx. Hmm, integration by parts seems necessary here. Let me set u = x and dv = e^x dx. Then du = dx and v = e^x. So, integration by parts formula is ∫u dv = u v - ∫v du. Applying that, ∫x e^x dx = x e^x - ∫e^x dx = x e^x - e^x + C.

Putting it all together, the integral of the right side is x e^x - e^x + C. So the equation becomes x y = x e^x - e^x + C. Now, solving for y, I divide both sides by x: y = (x e^x - e^x + C)/x. Simplifying that, y = e^x - (e^x)/x + C/x.

Wait, let me check that again. When I factor out e^x, I get y = (x e^x - e^x)/x + C/x. That simplifies to y = e^x (x - 1)/x + C/x. Alternatively, that's y = e^x (1 - 1/x) + C/x.

Now, I need to apply the initial condition y(1) = 0. Let's plug x = 1 into the equation. So, 0 = e^1 (1 - 1/1) + C/1. Simplify that: e (0) + C = 0. So C = 0.

Wait, because 1 - 1 is 0, so the first term is zero, and the second term is C. So 0 = 0 + C, which means C is zero.

So the solution simplifies to y = e^x (1 - 1/x). Let me write that as y = e^x ( (x - 1)/x ). Alternatively, y = e^x (1 - 1/x).

Now, I need to find f(2), which is y when x = 2. Plugging x=2 into the equation: y = e^2 (1 - 1/2) = e^2 * (1/2) = e^2 / 2.

Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the differential equation, I rearranged it correctly into linear form. The integrating factor was x, correct. Then after integrating, I got the solution, applied the initial condition, found C=0, and then evaluated at x=2.

Wait, let me recheck the integration step. So, after integrating x e^x dx, I had x e^x - e^x + C. Yes, that's correct because the integral of e^x is e^x. So when I divided by x, I correctly obtained e^x (1 - 1/x), because (x e^x - e^x)/x = e^x (x -1)/x = e^x (1 - 1/x). Correct.

So, plugging in x=2, y= e^2 (1 - 1/2) = e^2 * (1/2) = e^2 / 2, which is option D.

The differential equation is solved by rewriting it in linear form and finding an integrating factor. After integrating and applying the initial condition, the solution is found to be \( y = \frac{e^x (x - 1)}{x} \). Substituting \( x = 2 \) gives \( y = \frac{e^2}{2} \).
