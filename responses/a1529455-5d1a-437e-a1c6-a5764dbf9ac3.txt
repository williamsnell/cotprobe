Okay, so I need to prepare a balance sheet for Silvertown Office Supplies as of April 30. The company is owned by C.H. Walters. The information given includes various assets and liabilities. I have to calculate the total assets and then see which option matches.

First, let me list out all the assets and liabilities. The assets are Cash, Notes Receivable, Accounts Receivable, Merchandise Inventory, Store Supplies, Store Fixtures, and Furniture and Equipment. The liabilities are Notes Payable and Accounts Payable.

I think the balance sheet has two main parts: assets and liabilities. The total assets should be the sum of all asset items. Let me add them up.

Starting with the assets:
- Cash: $3,390
- Notes Receivable: $2,905
- Accounts Receivable: $8,215
- Merchandise Inventory: $23,600
- Store Supplies: $720
- Store Fixtures: $2,895
- Furniture and Equipment: $5,600

Let me add these step by step.

First, Cash + Notes Receivable: 3,390 + 2,905 = 6,295.

Next, add Accounts Receivable: 6,295 + 8,215 = 14,510.

Then, Merchandise Inventory: 14,510 + 23,600 = 38,110.

Add Store Supplies: 38,110 + 720 = 38,830.

Next, Store Fixtures: 38,830 + 2,895 = 41,725.

Finally, Furniture and Equipment: 41,725 + 5,600 = 47,325.

So the total assets are $47,325.

Now looking at the options, I see option H is 47,325. So that must be the correct answer.

The total assets are calculated by summing all asset items: $3,390 + $2,905 + $8,215 + $23,600 + $720 + $2,895 + $5,600 = $47,325. 

Answer: H
