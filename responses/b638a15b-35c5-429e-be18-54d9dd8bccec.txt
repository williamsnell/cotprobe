Alright, so I've got this question here: "What is three fifth of 100?" and I need to choose the correct answer from options A to J. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that "three fifth" refers to the fraction 3/5. So the question is asking for 3/5 of 100. To find a fraction of a number, I multiply the numerator by the number and then divide by the denominator. So in this case, it would be (3 * 100) / 5.

Let me calculate that. 3 times 100 is 300. Then I divide 300 by 5, which equals 60. So the result should be 60.

Now, looking at the options, I see that option F is 60. So that should be the correct answer.

Just to double-check, I can think about it another way. If one fifth of 100 is 20 (since 100 divided by 5 is 20), then three fifths would be three times that, which is 60. Yep, that confirms it again.

I don't think I'm making any mistakes here. The calculation seems straightforward. So I'm confident that the answer is F.
