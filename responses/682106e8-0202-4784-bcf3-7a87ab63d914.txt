Okay, so I have this problem where I need to calculate the kinetic energy of a car. The car weighs 2000 pounds and is moving at 50 miles per hour. I need to find the kinetic energy in both Joules and ergs. Hmm, let's start by recalling the formula for kinetic energy. I think it's KE = ½ mv², right? So, I need the mass and the velocity.

Wait, the weight is given in pounds, but I remember that in the metric system, weight is mass times gravity, but pounds are a unit of force. Oh right, so to get mass in kilograms, I should convert pounds to kilograms. How do I do that? I think 1 pound is approximately 0.4536 kilograms. So, 2000 pounds would be 2000 multiplied by 0.4536. Let me calculate that. 2000 * 0.4536 equals 907.2 kilograms. Okay, so mass m is 907.2 kg.

Next, the velocity is 50 miles per hour. I need to convert that to meters per second because the standard unit for velocity in kinetic energy is m/s. I remember that 1 mile is 1609 meters and 1 hour is 3600 seconds. So, 50 mph is 50 * 1609 meters per 3600 seconds. Let me compute that. 50 * 1609 is 80,450 meters per hour. Dividing by 3600 gives approximately 22.35 meters per second. Wait, let me double-check that math. 80,450 divided by 3600. Hmm, 3600 times 22 is 79,200. 80,450 minus 79,200 is 1,250. 1,250 divided by 3600 is about 0.347. So total is 22.347 m/s, which I can round to 22.35 m/s.

Now plug these into the kinetic energy formula. KE = 0.5 * m * v². So, 0.5 * 907.2 kg * (22.35 m/s)^2. Let me compute (22.35)^2 first. 22 squared is 484, and 0.35 squared is about 0.1225. But wait, (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b². So, 22.35^2 = (22 + 0.35)^2 = 22² + 2*22*0.35 + 0.35². 22² is 484, 2*22*0.35 is 15.4, and 0.35² is 0.1225. Adding those: 484 +15.4=499.4, plus 0.1225 is 499.5225. So, (22.35)^2 ≈ 499.5225 m²/s².

Now multiply that by mass and 0.5. KE = 0.5 * 907.2 * 499.5225. Let me compute 0.5 *907.2 first. That's 453.6. Then, 453.6 multiplied by 499.5225. Hmm, that's a big number. Let me approximate. 453.6 * 500 would be 226,800, but since it's 499.5225, it's a bit less. How much less? 500 -499.5225 is 0.4775. So, 0.4775 * 453.6 ≈ 453.6 * 0.4775. Let me compute that: 453.6 * 0.4 is 181.44, 453.6 *0.07 is about 31.752, 453.6 *0.0075 is 3.402. Adding those: 181.44 +31.752=213.192 +3.402=216.594. So total KE is 226,800 - 216.594 ≈ 226,583.4 Joules.

Wait, that's about 2.265834e5 Joules, which is 2.27 × 10^5 J. So looking at the options, option G is 2.27 × 10^5 J. Now, for ergs, since 1 Joule is 10^7 ergs. So 2.27e5 J *1e7 erg/J = 2.27e12 ergs. That matches option G as well. So the correct answer should be option G.

The kinetic energy is calculated using the formula \( KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \). Converting the car's weight to mass (907.2 kg) and speed to m/s (22.35 m/s), the energy is found to be approximately \( 2.27 \times 10^5 \) Joules and \( 2.27 \times 10^{12} \) ergs.
