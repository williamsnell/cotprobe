Okay, so I have this question here about how much money someone needs to make annually to be among the richest one percent in the world as of 2020. The options are from A to J, with amounts ranging from $15,000 up to $1,000,000. I'm not entirely sure about the exact figure, but I'll try to work through it.

First, I remember that the one percent cutoff is a commonly discussed figure, especially in economic and social contexts. From what I've heard, the threshold is higher than what most people earn, but it's not in the millions unless you're talking about the very top 0.1% or something like that.

I think the global income distribution might be a bit tricky because it varies by country. For instance, in developed countries like the USA, the threshold is higher than in developing countries. But since the question is about the world as a whole, I should consider the global average.

I recall reading somewhere that around $30,000 to $40,000 a year puts you in the top 10% globally. If that's the case, the top one percent would be higher than that. Maybe around $50,000 or more? But I'm not sure if it's $50,000 or higher.

Looking at the options, B is $50,000 and E is $100,000. I also remember that some sources suggest that the top one percent in the world earns more than $40,000. So $50,000 might be the right ballpark. But wait, I think in more recent data, the figure might be a bit higher. Maybe closer to $60,000 or $70,000?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The global one percent income thresholdâ€”I think the World Bank or some economic reports have specific numbers. From what I remember, the World Bank's data around 2020 suggested that the top one percent earns more than $38,000. So maybe $50,000 is the correct choice here.

Alternatively, I've heard that in the US, the top one percent makes over $500,000, but that's just for the US. Since the question is global, the threshold would be lower. So $50,000 seems plausible.

But wait, another angle: the global income inequality. The top one percent own about 40% of the world's wealth. So the income required to be part of that group would be significantly higher than the average. Let me see, if the median income is around $10,000, the top one percent would be much higher. Maybe around $30,000 to $40,000 is the top 10%, and the top one percent is higher than that.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn between B ($50k) and E ($100k). I think $50k is more likely because $100k might be the threshold for the top 5% or something like that globally. But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, maybe it's higher than $50k. Let me check my memory again.

I think the exact figure is $38,000, but that's not one of the options. The closest higher option is B: $50,000. So I'll go with that.

The answer is B: $50,000.
