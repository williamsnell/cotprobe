Question:

A previously healthy 14-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of a 2-day history of fever and pain and swelling of the right knee. She remembers injuring the knee while playing soccer last week, but she was able to finish the game. She has no history of rash or joint pain. Her sister has inflammatory bowel disease. The patient's temperature is 39째C (102.2째F), blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 20/min. Examination of the right knee shows swelling, tenderness, warmth, and erythema; range of motion is limited. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:

A: MRI of the right knee
B: X-ray of the right knee
C: Surgical intervention
D: Physiotherapy
E: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy
F: Nuclear scan of the right knee
G: Antibiotic therapy
H: Corticosteroid injection
I: Application of a knee brace
J: Arthrocentesis

Okay, so I have this question about a 14-year-old girl with a knee issue. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The patient has a 2-day history of fever, pain, and swelling in her right knee. She remembers hurting her knee during a soccer game a week ago but finished the game. No rash or other joint pain. Her sister has inflammatory bowel disease, which might be a clue. 

Her vital signs are: temp 39째C (102.2째F), BP 110/80, pulse 95, respirations 20. On exam, the knee is swollen, tender, warm, red, and has limited range of motion. 

So, the question is about the next step in management. The options are various tests and treatments. 

First, I should think about possible causes. The history of injury followed by fever and joint symptoms suggests a possible infection, like septic arthritis. Alternatively, it could be a post-traumatic inflammatory response. Her sister's IBD might hint towards a possible autoimmune or inflammatory condition, but the girl doesn't have joint pain elsewhere, so maybe it's less likely. 

In the physical exam, the signs are classic for joint infection: fever, warmth, redness, pain, and limited motion. So, septic arthritis is a big consideration here. 

If it's septic arthritis, the next step would be to confirm it. The gold standard is joint aspiration (arthrocentesis) to get synovial fluid for analysis. Culture and Gram stain can identify the bacteria and guide treatment. If it's positive, antibiotics would be needed. 

Looking at the options: 

A: MRI - Usually for structural issues like ligaments or fractures. Not the first step here. 

B: X-ray - Might show some signs, but if it's an infection, X-rays might not show much early on. Could rule out fractures. 

C: Surgical intervention - Probably not the first step unless there's a clear need for it, like a fracture or severe instability. 

D: Physiotherapy - Doesn't make sense if there's an infection; movement could worsen it. 

E: NSAIDs - Could help with pain and inflammation but wouldn't treat an infection. Also, if it's septic, using NSAIDs might mask the fever, which is a sign of infection. 

F: Nuclear scan - Not typically the first choice for acute joint issues. More for chronic or less obvious cases. 

G: Antibiotic therapy - If we suspect infection, but without confirmation, starting antibiotics might not be the best. Plus, arthrocentesis is needed to confirm. 

H: Corticosteroid injection - Usually for chronic conditions, not acute infections. Plus, steroids can mask infection signs. 

I: Knee brace - Might support the knee, but again, if there's an infection, it's better to treat that first. 

J: Arthrocentesis - This seems like the most appropriate next step. It can diagnose whether it's septic arthritis or something else, like gout or rheumatic condition. 

So, I think the answer is J: Arthrocentesis. It's the most appropriate to confirm the diagnosis before proceeding with treatment like antibiotics or other interventions.

The patient presents with a 2-day history of fever, pain, and swelling in the right knee following a soccer injury. The symptoms and physical examination findings, including fever, warmth, redness, and limited range of motion, are consistent with septic arthritis. Given the suspicion of infection, the next step should be arthrocentesis to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment. 

Answer: J
