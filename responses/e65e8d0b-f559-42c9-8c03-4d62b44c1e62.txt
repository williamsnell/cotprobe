Question:

On February 1, a woman conveys her farm to a man, and the man duly records the conveyance. The following day, the man conveys the property to his sister; she does not record her deed. Then on February 4, the man executes an identical conveyance of the farm to a friend. The friend gives the man a check for $100,000 for the property and records the conveyance, even though he has actual knowledge of the prior conveyance to the sister. The sister, however, records her deed on February 6. The friend then conveys his interest in the farm to a farmer, who gives a purchase price of $115,000 to the friend. On February 5, the farmer purchases the farm without notice of the conveyance to the sister and duly records the deed. If the property in question was located in a state having a notice-type statute, which of the following parties would ultimately prevail?

Options:

A: The man and the farmer.
B: The sister and the friend.
C: The friend.
D: The man.
E: None of the above.
F: The woman.
G: The sister.
H: Both the man and the friend.
I: The farmer.
J: Both the sister and the farmer.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this property law question. Let me read through it again and break it down step by step.

So, the situation is about conveyances of a farm and recording deeds. Here's what happened:

1. On February 1, a woman (let's call her Woman A) conveys her farm to a man (Man B). Man B records this conveyance right away. So, the deed is recorded on Feb 1.

2. The next day, on Feb 2, Man B conveys the property to his sister (Sister C). But Sister C doesn't record her deed. So, she has the deed but hasn't filed it with the authorities.

3. Then, on Feb 4, Man B executes an identical conveyance of the farm to a friend (Friend D). Friend D pays Man B $100,000 and records the deed. Importantly, Friend D knows about the prior conveyance to Sister C. So, Friend D is aware that Man B had previously given the farm to his sister.

4. On Feb 5, Friend D conveys his interest to a farmer (Farmer E). Farmer E pays $115,000 to Friend D and records the deed. The farmer didn't know about the conveyance to Sister C and recorded his deed on Feb 5.

Then, the question is about who would ultimately prevail if the property is in a state with a notice-type statute. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

I remember that in property law, recording statutes are important because they determine priority of interests when multiple people claim to have acquired the same property. There are notice, race, and race-notice statutes. Here, the state has a notice-type statute, which means a subsequent purchaser is protected if they take without notice of prior unrecorded conveyances and records first.

So, let's outline the timeline:

- Feb 1: Woman A conveys to Man B, who records.
- Feb 2: Man B conveys to Sister C, not recorded.
- Feb 4: Man B conveys to Friend D, Friend D records on the same day (Feb 4).
- Feb 5: Friend D conveys to Farmer E, who records on the same day (Feb 5).

Wait, but the sister records her deed on Feb 6, which is after Farmer E has recorded on Feb 5.

Now, the key here is the priority of the interests. Let's think about the chain of title.

Man B received the farm from Woman A on Feb 1 and recorded it. So, from Feb 1 onward, anyone dealing with Man B would have constructive notice of his ownership because the deed was recorded.

Then, on Feb 2, Man B conveyed to Sister C, but she didn't record. So, Sister C's interest is unrecorded. Friend D comes along on Feb 4, buys from Man B, and records immediately. Friend D had actual knowledge of Sister C's prior conveyance, but does that matter under the notice statute?

Wait, in a notice-type statute, a subsequent bona fide purchaser (BFP) who takes without notice and records first will have priority over prior unrecorded conveyances. But if the subsequent purchaser has actual notice, then they wouldn't be a BFP, so the prior unrecorded conveyance could take priority.

But in this case, Friend D had actual knowledge of the prior conveyance to Sister C. So, does that mean Friend D is not a BFP? Because a BFP must not only take without notice but also without knowledge that would put them on inquiry notice.

So, if Friend D had actual knowledge, he can't claim BFP status. That means Sister C's conveyance on Feb 2, even though unrecorded, might take priority over Friend D's conveyance on Feb 4, provided that Sister C records before Friend D does.

Wait, but Sister C didn't record until Feb 6, after Friend D had recorded on Feb 4. So, under a notice-type statute, if Friend D recorded first, and if he didn't have notice, he would take priority. But since Friend D had actual notice, he can't be a BFP, so Sister C's prior unrecorded deed might still take priority because she was first in time, even though she didn't record until later.

Wait, no. The recording acts are about giving notice to subsequent purchasers. If the prior conveyance is unrecorded, a subsequent BFP who records first takes priority. But if the subsequent purchaser has notice, then the prior unrecorded conveyance can still be valid against them.

So, in this case, Man B conveys to Sister C on Feb 2 (unrecorded). Then on Feb 4, Man B conveys to Friend D, who records on the same day. Friend D had actual knowledge of the Sister C conveyance, so he can't be a BFP. Therefore, Sister C's conveyance, even though unrecorded, would take priority over Friend D's conveyance because Friend D had notice.

But wait, when Friend D records on Feb 4, and Sister C records on Feb 6, does that matter? Since Sister C's conveyance was earlier in time but unrecorded, and Friend D's conveyance was later but recorded, but Friend D had notice.

So, in the chain, the first conveyance is to Man B (Feb 1), then Man B conveys to Sister C (Feb 2), and then to Friend D (Feb 4). But since Friend D had notice, he can't claim priority over Sister C.

So, Sister C's interest would take priority over Friend D's. But then Friend D conveyed to Farmer E on Feb 5, and Farmer E recorded on Feb 5 without notice of the Sister C conveyance.

Wait, but if Friend D's interest is subordinate to Sister C's, then when Friend D conveys to Farmer E, he can only convey what he has. If Friend D didn't have good title because Sister C's conveyance was prior, then Farmer E would take subject to Sister C's interest.

But does Farmer E have notice? Farmer E bought from Friend D on Feb 5, and recorded on the same day. Farmer E didn't have notice of Sister C's conveyance because she didn't record until Feb 6. So, when Farmer E took, Sister C's deed wasn't recorded yet. So, Farmer E would be a BFP because he had no notice of Sister C's prior unrecorded deed.

Wait, but let me think again. The priority would be:

1. Woman A to Man B (recorded Feb 1).

2. Man B to Sister C (Feb 2, unrecorded).

3. Man B to Friend D (Feb 4, recorded Feb 4).

4. Friend D to Farmer E (Feb 5, recorded Feb 5).

Sister C records on Feb 6.

Under a notice statute, a subsequent purchaser who is a BFP and records first takes priority over prior unrecorded deeds.

In this case, Friend D was not a BFP because he had actual notice of Sister C's conveyance. Therefore, Friend D's conveyance from Man B is junior to Sister C's unrecorded conveyance because Friend D had notice. So, Sister C's interest is superior to Friend D's.

Then, when Friend D conveys to Farmer E, he can't convey more than he has. Since Friend D's title was subordinate to Sister C, Farmer E would take subject to Sister C's interest. But Farmer E didn't have notice of Sister C's conveyance because she hadn't recorded yet when he bought on Feb 5.

So, Farmer E would be a BFP as to Sister C's interest because he had no notice and recorded first. Wait, but Friend D's conveyance was recorded on Feb 4, and Sister C recorded on Feb 6. So, when Farmer E recorded on Feb 5, he had no notice of Sister C's unrecorded deed.

Therefore, Farmer E would take free of Sister C's interest because he was a BFP and recorded before Sister C did.

Wait, but that can't be right because Sister C's conveyance was prior in time. Let me think again.

The key is that under a notice statute, a subsequent BFP who records first takes priority over prior unrecorded deeds. Here, Man B conveyed to Sister C on Feb 2 (unrecorded), and then to Friend D on Feb 4 (recorded). Friend D had actual notice, so he's not a BFP. Therefore, Sister C's conveyance is valid against Friend D, making Sister C the true owner.

But then, when Friend D conveys to Farmer E on Feb 5, he's conveying his interest, which is junior to Sister C. Farmer E, however, didn't have notice of Sister C's unrecorded deed and recorded on Feb 5, which is before Sister C recorded on Feb 6. So, Farmer E would be a BFP with respect to Sister C's interest because he recorded first and had no notice.

Therefore, Farmer E's interest would take priority over Sister C's because he was a BFP who recorded first. But wait, that seems contradictory because Sister C was earlier in time. But under the recording act, the priority is determined by who is the BFP and who records first.

So, the chain would be:

- Woman A to Man B (recorded).

- Man B to Sister C (unrecorded, Feb 2).

- Man B to Friend D (recorded, Feb 4). Friend D has notice, so not BFP.

- Friend D to Farmer E (recorded, Feb 5). Farmer E is BFP because no notice and recorded first.

Sister C records on Feb 6, after Farmer E.

So, the priority would be:

1. Farmer E (as BFP, recorded first).

2. Sister C (conveyance on Feb 2, unrecorded, but recorded later).

Wait, no. Because the recording act gives priority to the BFP who records first over prior unrecorded deeds. So, even though Sister C's conveyance was earlier, because she didn't record until after Farmer E did, Farmer E would take priority.

But wait, the problem is that Friend D's conveyance to Farmer E came after Sister C's conveyance, but Friend D had notice, so his title was subordinate. But Farmer E, as a BFP, would take free of any prior unrecorded interests, even if the prior conveyance was to someone else.

So, in the end, Farmer E would have the best title because he was a BFP who recorded before Sister C did. Therefore, the farmer would prevail.

But looking back at the options, option I is "The farmer." So, the answer would be I.

But wait, let me check again. The sister recorded on Feb 6, after the farmer. So, the farmer's deed was recorded first. Since the farmer had no notice of the sister's deed and recorded first, he would take priority over the sister's unrecorded deed. Therefore, the farmer would hold the valid title.

So, the correct answer should be I: The farmer.

The scenario involves a chain of conveyances with recording issues under a notice-type statute. The key points are:

1. **Feb 1**: Woman A conveys to Man B, who records.
2. **Feb 2**: Man B conveys to Sister C, who does not record.
3. **Feb 4**: Man B conveys to Friend D, who records on the same day but has actual knowledge of Sister C's prior conveyance.
4. **Feb 5**: Friend D conveys to Farmer E, who records on the same day without notice of Sister C's conveyance.
5. **Feb 6**: Sister C records her deed.

Under a notice-type statute, a subsequent bona fide purchaser (BFP) who records first takes priority over prior unrecorded conveyances. Friend D is not a BFP because he had actual notice of Sister C's conveyance. However, Farmer E is a BFP because he had no notice of Sister C's unrecorded deed and recorded first (on Feb 5, before Sister C recorded on Feb 6). Therefore, Farmer E's title prevails.

**Answer: I**
