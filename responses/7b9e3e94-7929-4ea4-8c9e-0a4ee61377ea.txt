Question:

The tax rate in the town of Centerville is 11(1 / 2)%. If a tax of $1,794 was paid on a piece of property and the assessment rate in Centerville is 30%, what is the expected market value of the property?

H: $15,600
I: $52,000
J: $21,000

Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the market value of a property based on the tax paid. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

First, I know that the tax rate is 11 and a half percent, which is 11.5%. The tax paid is $1,794. The assessment rate is 30%, which I think means that the tax is calculated on 30% of the property's market value. So, the property's assessed value is 30% of the market value, and then the tax is 11.5% of that assessed value.

Let me write down what I know:

- Tax Rate (T) = 11.5% or 0.115
- Tax Paid (Tx) = $1,794
- Assessment Rate (A) = 30% or 0.30
- Market Value (MV) = ?

I think the formula connects these values. The tax paid is based on the assessed value, which is a percentage of the market value. So, the formula should be:

Tx = T * (A * MV)

I need to solve for MV. Let me rearrange the formula:

MV = Tx / (T * A)

Plugging in the numbers:

MV = 1794 / (0.115 * 0.30)

Let me compute the denominator first: 0.115 multiplied by 0.30. 

0.115 * 0.3 = 0.0345

So now, MV = 1794 / 0.0345

Hmm, let me do that division. 1794 divided by 0.0345. I can think of this as 1794 divided by 34.5 thousandths, which is the same as multiplying by 1000/34.5. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to multiply numerator and denominator by 1000 to eliminate decimals.

So, 1794 * 1000 = 1,794,000
0.0345 * 1000 = 34.5

Now, 1,794,000 divided by 34.5.

Let me calculate this. 34.5 times 50,000 is 1,725,000 because 34.5 * 50 = 1,725, so times 1000 gives 1,725,000. 

Subtracting that from 1,794,000: 1,794,000 - 1,725,000 = 69,000.

Now, how many times does 34.5 go into 69,000? Let's see, 34.5 * 2000 = 69,000 because 34.5 * 2 = 69, so times 1000 gives 69,000.

So adding up, 50,000 + 2,000 = 52,000.

Wait, that can't be right because 34.5 * 52,000 would be 34.5 * 50,000 = 1,725,000 plus 34.5 * 2,000 = 69,000, which totals 1,794,000. So yes, that checks out.

So the market value is $52,000. Looking at the options, I see option I is $52,000.

Wait, but I should double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Let me go through the calculation again:

Tax Paid = 11.5% * (30% * MV)
1794 = 0.115 * 0.3 * MV
1794 = 0.0345 * MV
MV = 1794 / 0.0345 = 52,000.

Yes, that seems correct. So the answer should be I: $52,000.

The tax paid is calculated based on the assessed value, which is 30% of the market value. Using the formula, the market value is found by dividing the tax paid by the product of the tax rate and assessment rate, resulting in $52,000.
