Okay, so I've got this question here: Find the logarithm of 3 squared. Hmm, let's break this down. Wait, logarithm of 3^2. I remember that logarithms have some properties that might help here. 

First, I should figure out what 3 squared is. 3 times 3 is 9, right? So the question is asking for log base 10 of 9, I think, because the options look like common logarithms, not natural logs. 

Now, the logarithm of 9. I know that log(10) is 1, and log(1) is 0. So 9 is between 1 and 10, meaning its log should be between 0 and 1. Let me see the options. Options F, G, J are between 0 and 1. H is 2.3026, which I think is ln(10), so that's natural log, not common. 

Wait, but the question just says "logarithm," so I might need to clarify the base. Usually, in math problems without a specified base, it's base 10. So I'll go with that. 

So log10(9) is what we're looking for. I remember that log10(9) is the same as log10(3^2). Using the logarithm power rule, which says log_b(a^n) = n * log_b(a), that would mean log10(3^2) = 2 * log10(3). 

Do I know log10(3) by heart? I think it's approximately 0.4771. So if I multiply that by 2, I get 0.9542. Let me check the options: G is 0.9542. So that should be the answer. 

Wait, let me double-check. If I square 3 to get 9, and then take log10(9), that should be the same as 2 times log10(3). Yeah, that makes sense. So the answer must be G. 

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate it directly. Let's see, 10^0.9542 is approximately 9? Let me think. 10^0.9542 is roughly 10^(0.95) which is about 8.91, close to 9. So that seems right. 

Another way: since 9 is 3 squared, and log(3) is around 0.4771, multiplying by 2 gives 0.9542. So yes, G is the correct option.

The logarithm of 3 squared is calculated using the power rule: log(3²) = 2 log(3). Since log(3) ≈ 0.4771, multiplying by 2 gives 0.9542. 

Answer: G
