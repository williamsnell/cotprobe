Okay, so I have this question about a theory in philosophy, specifically in the area of mind and consciousness. The question is asking about the theory that says mental states are nothing but brain states. I need to choose the correct term from the given options, which are labeled A through J.

First, I should probably recall what each of these terms means. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A is monism. Monism is the belief that everything is made of a single substance or element. In the context of mind and body, monism would suggest that both the mental and physical are aspects of the same substance. So, maybe that's related, but I'm not sure if it's exactly the same as saying mental states are brain states.

Option B is functionalism. Functionalism is a theory in philosophy of mind that defines mental states in terms of their functions or roles. It's more about how mental states cause behavior rather than what they are made of. So mental states are defined by their function, not necessarily by being identical to brain states.

Option C is identity theory. This is the view that each mental state is identical to some brain state. That sounds exactly like what the question is asking about, because it's stating that mental states are nothing but brain states. So this might be the correct answer.

Option D is dualism. Dualism is the belief that mind and body are two distinct substances. This is the opposite of what the question is asking because dualism suggests that mental states are separate from brain states, not the same.

Option E is brain theory. This term isn't as familiar to me. It might be a less common term, perhaps a simplified way to refer to the idea that the brain is the cause of mental states, but I'm not sure if it's the same as the identity theory.

Option F is logical behaviorism. This theory holds that talk about the mind can be translated into talk about observable behavior. So it doesn't necessarily say that mental states are brain states, just that they can be described in terms of behavior.

Option G is eliminative materialism. This is the view that certain mental states (like beliefs and desires) don't actually exist and should be eliminated from our theory of the mind. It's more about dismissing mental states rather than equating them with brain states.

Option H is physicalism. Physicalism is the belief that everything is physical, including the mind. It's similar to identity theory but broader. Physicalism would say that mental states are physical states, but it might not necessarily mean that each mental state is identical to a specific brain state. It could allow for different physical states to correspond to the same mental state.

Option I is epiphenominalism. This theory suggests that mental states are byproducts of physical states but don't have any causal power. So mental states exist but aren't the same as brain states; they're just additional phenomena.

Option J is reductionism. Reductionism is the idea that complex phenomena can be reduced to simpler ones. In the context of mind, it could mean that mental states can be reduced to physical states, but again, this is a broader concept and might not specifically mean identity in the way the question is phrased.

Now, putting this together. The question is about the theory that mental states are nothing but brain states. That sounds exactly like the identity theory (Option C). Identity theory posits that each mental state is the same as a specific brain state. Physicalism (Option H) is a related concept but is broader, allowing for a more general physical basis without requiring each mental state to map directly to a brain state.

So, I think the correct answer is C: identity theory.

The theory that mental states are identical to brain states is known as identity theory. This theory posits that each mental state corresponds exactly to a specific brain state, making them the same thing. While physicalism (Option H) is related, it is broader and does not necessarily require a one-to-one correspondence. Therefore, the correct answer is:

C: identity theory

Answer: C
