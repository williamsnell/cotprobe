Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the significance of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933. I remember that this was part of the New Deal programs during the Great Depression. The main goal of the New Deal was to recover from the economic crisis, and agriculture was a big part of the economy back then.

I think the AAA was aimed at helping farmers because many were struggling due to overproduction and low prices. If I recall correctly, there was something about reducing crop production to boost prices. Maybe they paid farmers to not plant certain crops or to leave land fallow. That would reduce supply, which in turn would increase prices.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. Option A says it was about enhancing military food supplies. That doesn't sound right because the primary focus was on helping farmers and the economy, not military needs. Option B talks about prohibiting modern farming equipment. I don't think that's correct; the act was more about production control rather than equipment.

Option C mentions a fixed-rate tax on exports. I'm not sure about that; I don't recall taxes being a main focus. Option D says it established parity as a cornerstone. Parity, if I remember, refers to the idea that the price received by farmers for their goods should be equal to the purchasing power they had in 1913. So the AAA aimed to restore this parity by adjusting crop levels. That sounds plausible.

Option E talks about mandating industrialization of farming. That doesn't fit because the act was about reducing production, not industrializing. Option F says it's about urban development, which doesn't make sense since it's an agricultural act. Option G suggests deregulating crop prices, but I think the opposite was trueâ€”government involvement increased to control prices.

Option H says it abolished parity, but that's the opposite of what happened. The act was trying to establish parity, not eliminate it. Option I claims it aimed to increase production to lower prices. Wait, that seems contradictory. If you increase production, prices usually go down, but the act was about reducing production to raise prices. So I think I is incorrect.

Option J says it reduced the importance of agricultural policy. That's not correct because the act was a significant piece of legislation focusing on agriculture.

So putting it all together, the key point was about parity and adjusting agricultural policies to help farmers by controlling production. Therefore, the correct answer should be D: The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 established the concept of parity as a cornerstone of agricultural policy.

The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 was a key part of the New Deal, focusing on aiding farmers by controlling production to raise prices and restore economic stability. It introduced the concept of parity, ensuring farmers' purchasing power matched that of 1913.
