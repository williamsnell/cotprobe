Okay, so I have this question about Sinnott-Armstrong and what they're interested in regarding moral obligations. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, the question is asking who Sinnott-Armstrong is most interested in examining issues about the moral obligations of. The options are from A to J, covering educational institutions, environmental entities, animals, governments, corporations, families, religious groups, technology companies, societies, and individuals.

I remember that Sinnott-Armstrong is a philosopher, maybe working on ethics. I think they focus on applied ethics, which deals with real-world moral issues. Applied ethics often looks at how different entities have moral responsibilities. So, who among these options is a common focus in applied ethics?

I recall that in ethics, especially applied, there's a lot of discussion about corporations. Issues like corporate responsibility, environmental impact, labor practices, etc., are big topics. Philanthropy and business ethics are areas where philosophers examine what companies should do beyond just making profits. So Sinnott-Armstrong might be looking at the moral obligations of corporations.

Looking at the other options: environmental entities (like NGOs or nature itself) is possible, but I'm not sure if that's the primary focus. Animals are a big topic in ethics too, especially with people like Peter Singer, but I'm not certain if Sinnott-Armstrong is known for that. Governments and societies are more about collective responsibility, which is important, but I think corporations are more specific.

Families, religious groups, and technology companies could be relevant, but again, I think the main area is corporations. So I'm leaning towards E: corporations.

The correct answer is E: corporations.

The answer is E.
