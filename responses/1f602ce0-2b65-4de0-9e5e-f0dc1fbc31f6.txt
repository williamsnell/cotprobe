Question:

A customer at a fish market was leaving the store after purchasing an assortment of shrimp, oysters, and scallops. He was walking along the sidewalk in front of the store when he slipped on a piece of eel. He brought suit against the owner of the market claiming that he suffered leg and back injuries. The owner, although admitting that the customer was injured by slipping on the eel, denied negligence and claimed that the customer was contributorily negligent. At trial, the owner calls a witness to testify that before the fall he heard someone call out to the customer, "Watch it, buddy, you're going to step on that piece of fish. "The witness's testimony is

Options:

A: admissible, as it is a statement that was made in the heat of the moment.
B: inadmissible, because the customer did not acknowledge hearing the warning.
C: inadmissible, because it was not a spontaneous utterance.
D: inadmissible, as hearsay not within any exception.
E: admissible, because it is relevant as to the customer's contributory negligence.
F: admissible, because it provides context to the event.
G: inadmissible, because the witness was not directly involved in the incident.
H: admissible, because it indicates that the owner had no control over the situation.
I: admissible, as a statement of the declarant's present state of mind.
J: inadmissible, as it is considered second-hand information.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question. Let me read through it carefully.

The scenario is about a customer who slipped on an eel at a fish market and sued the owner. The owner is claiming contributory negligence, so they're probably trying to shift some blame onto the customer. At trial, the owner calls a witness who heard someone shout a warning to the customer before he fell. The question is about the admissibility of this testimony.

First, I remember that in evidence law, out-of-court statements offered for the truth are generally hearsay unless an exception applies. So, the statement here is someone else telling the customer to watch out. The witness is testifying about what they heard, which is a statement made by someone else.

The options are A through J. Let's go through them one by one, but maybe I should think about the hearsay exceptions first. The statement might be an excited utterance under the hearsay exception. Excited utterances are statements made under the stress of a startling event and relate to that event. Here, the warning was right before the slip, so it's probably made in the heat of the moment.

Looking at the options:

A: Admissible as a heat of the moment statement. That sounds like the excited utterance exception.

B: Inadmissible because the customer didn't acknowledge it. I don't think acknowledgment is required for admissibility. The statement's reliability comes from the fact that it was made under stress, not the recipient's reaction.

C: Inadmissible because not spontaneous. Wait, if it's a spontaneous utterance, then it is. So C is incorrect.

D: Inadmissible as hearsay without exception. Well, if it fits an exception like excited utterance, then D is wrong.

E: Admissible for contributory negligence. That's about relevance. The statement could show the customer was warned, supporting contributory negligence, but the main issue is whether it's admissible at all. So E is possible, but the primary issue is hearsay.

F: Admissible as context. Maybe, but not sure. Context is more about the setting, but here it's a statement that might be hearsay unless an exception applies.

G: Inadmissible because the witness wasn't involved. I don't think involvement is required. The witness can testify to what they heard regardless of involvement.

H: Admissible because it shows owner's lack of control. Not sure about that. The statement is about the warning, not about the owner's control.

I: Admissible as a statement of the declarant's state of mind. That's another exception. If the warning was an expression of fear or concern, it could be a statement of then-existing state of mind. But I think the excited utterance is a better fit here.

J: Inadmissible as second-hand information. No, the witness is testifying about what they heard directly, not hearsay within hearsay. So J is incorrect.

So, the statement is likely admissible under the excited utterance exception, which would make A correct. Also, E is about relevance, which is true, but the main point is whether it's admissible in the first place. So the correct answer is either A or E, but A is about admissibility, while E is about relevance.

Wait, but the question is about the testimony's admissibility, not just relevance. So A is about the exception, making it admissible. So the answer is A.

The statement made by the witness is admissible under the hearsay exception for excited utterances, as it was spontaneous and related to the incident. Therefore, the correct answer is:

A
