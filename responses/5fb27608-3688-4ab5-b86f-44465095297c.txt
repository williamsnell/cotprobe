Question:

A developer is the owner of a parcel of land in fee simple absolute (the record title is also in the developer). The parcel of land is and has been unpossessed land. Assume that each person listed below as the grantee in a deed paid value and took without actual notice of any facts that would defeat her title and without knowledge of any facts that would put her on inquiry, both at the time she took her deed and at the time she recorded it. The following conveyances, each by a general warranty deed, take place in the order listed: An artist conveys to a bartender; the developer conveys to the artist; the artist conveys to a counselor; the bartender conveys to a dentist; the counselor conveys to an engineer. No deed was recorded until after the artist-to- counselor deed was executed and then before the execution of any other deed, the order of recording was as follows: developer to artist; artist to bartender; artist to counselor. The bartender-to-dentist deed and counselor-to- engineer deed were each recorded immediately after their respective executions. The owner of the parcel of land in a notice jurisdiction is

Options:

A: the artist.
B: the engineer.
C: the developer.
D: the dentist.
E: all of the above.
F: the developer and the artist jointly.
G: the bartender.
H: the counselor and the engineer jointly.
I: none of the above.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this property law question. It's about conveyances and recording statutes, specifically in a notice jurisdiction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, let me read the question again carefully. The developer owns a parcel of land in fee simple absolute, and the record title is also in the developer. The land has been unpossessed. So, no one has been living on it or using it in a way that would put others on notice.

Now, there are a series of conveyances via general warranty deeds. The order is:

1. An artist conveys to a bartender.
2. The developer conveys to the artist.
3. The artist conveys to a counselor.
4. The bartender conveys to a dentist.
5. The counselor conveys to an engineer.

Each grantee paid value and took without actual notice of any facts that would defeat their title. They also didn't have any knowledge that would put them on inquiry at the time they took their deed or when they recorded it.

Next, the recording details: no deed was recorded until after the artist conveyed to the counselor. Then, the order of recording was:

- Developer to artist
- Artist to bartender
- Artist to counselor

After that, the bartender-to-dentist and counselor-to-engineer deeds were each recorded immediately after their execution.

The question is asking who owns the parcel of land in a notice jurisdiction. The options are A through I.

I need to figure out who has the valid title. Let me think about how recording statutes work, especially in notice jurisdictions. In a notice jurisdiction, a subsequent bona fide purchaser (BFP) who takes without notice of prior conveyances has priority over those prior unrecorded conveyances.

So the key here is the recording times and the order of conveyances.

Let me outline the conveyance chain and the recording timeline.

1. Developer conveys to artist (Deed D-A). This is the first conveyance, but when was it recorded? According to the recording order, the first recorded deed is D-A. So it was recorded at some point after the artist conveyed to the counselor, but before the other deeds were executed. Wait, no—let me clarify.

The conveyances happened in the order listed: A→B, D→A, A→C, B→D, C→E.

But the recordings happened as follows: after the A→C deed was executed, the order of recording was D→A, then A→B, then A→C. Then, B→D and C→E were recorded immediately after their execution.

So the timeline is:

- A→B (conveyance 1)
- D→A (conveyance 2)
- A→C (conveyance 3)
- B→D (conveyance 4)
- C→E (conveyance 5)

Recordings:

- After conveyance 3 (A→C), the order of recording was D→A, then A→B, then A→C. So D→A was recorded first, then A→B, then A→C.

Then, conveyances 4 and 5 (B→D and C→E) were recorded immediately after their execution, meaning they were recorded right after they were executed.

Now, in a notice jurisdiction, the priority is determined based on whether a subsequent purchaser had notice of prior unrecorded deeds.

Let me consider each grantee:

1. The bartender (B) received the deed from A. But wait, A received from D first. So D→A was the first conveyance. But when A conveyed to B, did B have notice? Since B is a BFP, they took without notice. But the problem is the recording.

Wait, the developer (D) conveyed to A, but when did that get recorded? The recording happened after A conveyed to C, but before B's deed was recorded. So D→A was recorded before A→B was recorded.

Wait, no: the order of recording after A→C was D→A, then A→B, then A→C. So D→A was recorded first, then A→B, then A→C.

Wait, that can't be right. Because A→B happened before D→A? No, no. The conveyances happened in the order D→A, then A→B, then A→C, then B→D, then C→E.

Wait, no: the conveyances are in the order listed. So the first conveyance is A→B, then D→A, then A→C, then B→D, then C→E.

Wait, that seems confusing. Let me clarify:

The conveyances are:

1. A→B
2. D→A
3. A→C
4. B→D
5. C→E

So, the first conveyance is A→B. Then the developer conveys to A. Then A conveys to C. Then B conveys to D. Then C conveys to E.

Now, the recording happened after the A→C deed was executed. So, after conveyance 3 (A→C), the order of recording was D→A, then A→B, then A→C. Then, B→D and C→E were recorded immediately after their execution.

So the recording order after A→C was:

- D→A recorded first
- Then A→B
- Then A→C

Then, B→D and C→E were recorded right after they were executed.

So, for each grantee, I need to see if they had notice of prior claims.

Let me consider who has priority.

The developer (D) originally had the fee simple. Then D conveyed to A (conveyance 2), which was recorded after A→C. So when did D→A get recorded? It was the first to be recorded after A→C. So when A→B happened (conveyance 1), D had already conveyed to A, but D→A wasn't recorded yet. So when A conveyed to B, A's title was from D, but D→A wasn't recorded yet. So when A→B was executed, D→A hadn't been recorded yet.

In a notice jurisdiction, a subsequent BFP takes free of prior unrecorded deeds. So when B bought from A, B had no notice of D's prior conveyance because it wasn't recorded yet. So B would have a valid title from A, but A's title was from D. But since D→A wasn't recorded, A's title may be subject to prior claims.

Wait, no. Let me think again. D conveyed to A, but didn't record it yet. Then A conveys to B. When B took from A, B had no notice of D's prior conveyance because it wasn't recorded. So B is a BFP, and thus takes free of D's unrecorded deed. So B would have a valid title.

But then, after that, D→A was recorded. So when D→A was recorded, A already conveyed to B and C. So recording after the fact doesn't help D because the prior conveyances from A are valid as BFPs.

Wait, but A got the deed from D, but didn't record it until after A had conveyed to B. So when A conveyed to B, A had legal title because D had conveyed to A, but since it wasn't recorded, A's title was still valid, but any subsequent purchaser from A would be protected if they didn't have notice.

So B is a BFP and takes free of D's prior unrecorded deed.

Similarly, when A conveyed to C, A's title was from D, but D→A was recorded after A→C. So when A→C happened, D→A wasn't recorded yet, so C is a BFP and takes free of D's prior unrecorded deed.

Now, when B conveyed to D (wait, no, B conveyed to dentist, which is D? Wait, the names are: A→B (bartender), then D→A, then A→C (counselor), then B→D (dentist), then C→E (engineer).

So B→D is the dentist. So when B conveyed to D, the dentist, the deed from B was executed and recorded immediately. Similarly, C→E was recorded immediately.

Now, the question is, who has the valid title.

I think the key is to determine who is the true owner, considering the recording statutes and the priority of claims.

In a notice jurisdiction, the first to record has priority if they are a BFP. But in this case, the first conveyance was A→B, but D→A was not recorded until after A→C was executed. So when A→B happened, D→A was unrecorded, so B is a BFP and takes from A. Then, D→A was recorded, but by that time, B had already taken from A. So D's recording doesn't affect B's title because B was a BFP.

Then, A conveyed to C. At that time, D→A was still unrecorded, but A had already conveyed to B. So when A→C happened, A's title was from D, but D→A was unrecorded, so C is a BFP and takes from A.

So now, the chain is D→A→B and D→A→C.

But when D→A was recorded, it was after A had conveyed to B and C. So the recording doesn't affect B and C because they were BFPs.

Then, B conveys to the dentist. The dentist took from B, who had title from A, who had title from D, but D's deed wasn't recorded until after B's conveyance. So the dentist is a BFP from B.

Similarly, C conveys to E. E is a BFP from C.

So now, the problem is that multiple people have deeds, but who has priority?

Wait, but the land can only have one owner. So I need to see who has the valid claim.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the developer (D) conveyed to A, but didn't record until after A conveyed to B and C. So when D→A was recorded, A had already conveyed to B and C, who were BFPs. So the recording of D→A doesn't affect B and C's titles because they had already taken without notice.

So the developer's deed to A was effective, but because it wasn't recorded in time, A could convey valid title to B and C. Then, B and C could convey to others.

So the current grantees are B→D (dentist) and C→E (engineer). Both of these conveyances were recorded immediately after execution.

But the problem is, the land is in a notice jurisdiction, and the question is who owns it now.

Wait, but the developer conveyed to A, but A conveyed to B and C, who are BFPs. Then B and C conveyed to others, who are also BFPs.

So the chain is:

D→A (unrecorded until after A→B and A→C)

A→B (recorded after A→C)

A→C (recorded after A→B)

B→D (dentist) (recorded immediately)

C→E (engineer) (recorded immediately)

So, the issue is whether the developer's conveyance to A is valid, but because it wasn't recorded in time, A's conveyances to B and C are valid as BFPs.

Therefore, the current owners would be the dentist (from B) and the engineer (from C). But the land can't be owned by two people. So perhaps only one of them has a valid claim.

Wait, but the initial conveyance was from D to A, which was unrecorded. Then A conveyed to B and C. Since B and C are BFPs, they each take valid title from A. But how can A convey title to two people? That would create two conflicting titles.

Ah, but in reality, once A conveys to B, A no longer owns the land. So when A then conveys to C, A has nothing to convey. Therefore, the conveyance from A to C would be ineffective because A had already conveyed to B.

Wait, that's a crucial point. If A conveys to B first, then A no longer owns the land. So when A tries to convey to C, there's nothing left to convey. Therefore, A→C is ineffective, and C has no title.

Wait, but the question says each conveyance is by a general warranty deed, so we can assume they are valid unless there's a prior unrecorded deed that invalidates it.

So, the situation is:

- D→A (unrecorded until after A→B and A→C)

- A→B (recorded after A→C)

- A→C (recorded after A→B)

But since A conveyed to B first, A no longer owns the land. Therefore, A's conveyance to C is ineffective. So C doesn't get any title from A. Therefore, C→E is also ineffective.

But the question states that each grantee paid value and took without actual notice, so we have to assume that each conveyance was valid at the time, but perhaps they are not because of prior claims.

Wait, but in a notice jurisdiction, a subsequent BFP takes free of prior unrecorded conveyances. So when A→B happened, D→A was unrecorded, so B takes free of D's claim. Similarly, when A→C happened, D→A was unrecorded, so C takes free of D's claim.

But since A can only convey once, the second conveyance (A→C) is ineffective because A had already conveyed to B. Therefore, C's title is invalid, and E's title is also invalid.

Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the developer's conveyance to A was valid, but unrecorded. Then, A conveyed to B, who is a BFP, so B takes title. Then, A tried to convey to C, but since A had already conveyed to B, that conveyance is ineffective. Therefore, C has no title, and E has no title.

So the dentist (from B) has the valid title, and the engineer doesn't.

But wait, the conveyances happened in the order A→B, then D→A, then A→C, then B→D, then C→E.

So, when D→A was recorded after A→C, but before B→D and C→E.

Wait, no. The order of recording after A→C was D→A, then A→B, then A→C. Then B→D and C→E were recorded immediately after their execution.

So, when B→D was executed, it was recorded immediately. Similarly, C→E was recorded immediately.

So, the recording timeline is:

1. A→B (conveyance 1) → not recorded yet
2. D→A (conveyance 2) → not recorded yet
3. A→C (conveyance 3) → not recorded yet
4. Record D→A
5. Record A→B
6. Record A→C
7. B→D (conveyance 4) → recorded immediately
8. C→E (conveyance 5) → recorded immediately

Wait, no. The problem states that no deed was recorded until after the artist (A) conveyed to the counselor (C). Then, the order of recording was D→A, then A→B, then A→C. After that, B→D and C→E were recorded immediately.

So, the sequence is:

- Conveyances:

1. A→B
2. D→A
3. A→C
4. B→D
5. C→E

- Recordings:

- After conveyance 3 (A→C), the order was D→A recorded first, then A→B, then A→C.

- Then, conveyances 4 and 5 were recorded immediately after execution.

So, the recording order is:

- D→A recorded first (after A→C)
- Then A→B recorded
- Then A→C recorded
- Then B→D recorded immediately after conveyance 4
- Then C→E recorded immediately after conveyance 5.

Now, in a notice jurisdiction, a BFP takes free of prior unrecorded conveyances.

So, when A→B happened (conveyance 1), D→A was unrecorded, so B is a BFP and takes from A. Similarly, when A→C happened (conveyance 3), D→A was unrecorded, so C is a BFP and takes from A.

But wait, A can't convey to both B and C because after conveying to B, A no longer owns the land. Therefore, the conveyance to C is ineffective, so C has no title, and E has no title.

But the problem states that each conveyance is by a general warranty deed, implying they are valid. So perhaps the assumption is that A had the authority to convey, perhaps with the developer's permission or something, but that's probably not relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the developer's conveyance to A was effective, but unrecorded, so A could convey to B and C as BFPs. But since A can only own once, the second conveyance is ineffective.

So, the first conveyance from A→B is valid, making B the owner. Then, when A tried to convey to C, A had nothing to convey, so C has no title. Therefore, B conveyed to the dentist, who is now the owner. The engineer (E) has no title because C didn't have any.

Wait, but the question is asking who is the owner now. So, the dentist (from B) would have the title, and the engineer (from C) would not.

But looking at the options, D is the dentist. So the answer would be D, the dentist.

But wait, let me check again.

The developer conveyed to A, but didn't record. Then A conveyed to B, who is a BFP, so B takes from A. Then, A tried to convey to C, but since A no longer owns the land, C gets nothing. Therefore, C→E is ineffective.

Then, B conveyed to the dentist, who is a BFP, so the dentist takes from B. Therefore, the dentist is the owner.

So the answer should be D: the dentist.
</think>

The question revolves around a series of conveyances and recording events under a notice jurisdiction. The developer (D) owns the land and conveys it to the artist (A), who later conveys it to others. The key points are:

1. **Conveyance Order**: The conveyances occur in the following order:
   - A→B (bartender)
   - D→A (developer to artist)
   - A→C (counselor)
   - B→D (dentist)
   - C→E (engineer)

2. **Recording Order**: 
   - After A→C, the order of recording is:
     - D→A
     - A→B
     - A→C
   - B→D and C→E are recorded immediately after their execution.

3. **Notice Jurisdiction**: In a notice jurisdiction, a bona fide purchaser (BFP) who takes without notice of prior unrecorded conveyances has priority over those prior unrecorded deeds.

4. **Analysis**:
   - When A→B occurred, D→A was unrecorded. B is a BFP and takes valid title from A.
   - When A→C occurred, D→A was still unrecorded. C is a BFP and takes valid title from A.
   - However, A can only convey the land once. After A→B, A no longer owns the land, making A→C ineffective. Thus, C and E have no valid title.
   - B→D is valid because B, as a BFP, had clear title when conveying to the dentist. The dentist is a BFP and takes valid title from B.

5. **Conclusion**: The dentist (D) is the rightful owner as they are the last valid grantee in the chain of title.

Answer: D
