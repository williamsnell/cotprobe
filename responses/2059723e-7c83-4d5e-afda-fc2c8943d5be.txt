Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about hominids and changes related to brain size. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking which of the options describes a key change starting at least with Homo erectus, and it's probably related to their increasingly larger brain size. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I should recall what Homo erectus is known for. I remember that Homo erectus had a significant increase in brain size compared to earlier hominids like Australopithecus. That makes sense because larger brains often require changes in the body and structure to support them.

Looking at the options:

A: Cranial reduction. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Cranial reduction would mean the skull getting smaller, but if the brain is getting larger, the skull should be getting bigger, not smaller. So maybe A isn't the answer.

B: Decreased dentition. I'm not too sure about this one. Decreased dentition would mean fewer teeth. I'm not certain if this is directly related to brain size. Maybe it's more about diet changes, like eating softer foods or using tools, but I'm not sure if it's the key change here.

C: Microcephaly. Wait, microcephaly is when the head is smaller than normal, which is the opposite of what's happening with brain size increase. So C is probably not correct.

D: Supraorbital cortex. I'm not familiar with that term. Maybe it's referring to the area above the eyes? Not sure how that relates to brain size. Maybe it's a distractor.

E: Encephalization. Encephalization refers to the increase in brain size relative to body size. I think this is the key term here. Homo erectus showed a significant encephalization compared to earlier species, which means their brains were larger proportionally to their bodies. That seems directly related to the question.

F: Opposable thumbs. Opposable thumbs are important for tool use, which Homo erectus definitely had. But the question is about changes related to brain size. While opposable thumbs are useful for manipulating tools, I don't think they're a direct result of increased brain size. More of a behavioral adaptation.

G: Prognathism. That's about the forward projection of the lower jaw. I think earlier hominids like Australopithecus had more prognathic faces, but Homo erectus had a more modern face with reduced prognathism. But how does that relate to brain size? Maybe less pronounced facial features allowed for a larger braincase, but I'm not sure if that's the key change being asked here.

H: Neoteny. Neoteny is retaining juvenile features into adulthood. I don't think that's the main change linked to brain size in Homo erectus. Maybe more relevant to other aspects of evolution.

I: Bipedalism. Bipedalism is walking on two legs, which is a key feature of hominids, including Homo erectus. While bipedalism freed up the hands for tool use and allowed for other changes, the question is about changes related to brain size. Bipedalism might have contributed to freeing up the hands, which in turn allowed for more complex tools and possibly supported a larger brain in terms of energy use, but the direct change related to brain size might not be bipedalism itself.

J: Increased body size. Homo erectus did have a larger body size than earlier hominids, but the question is about a change related to brain size. While a larger body might support a larger brain, the term "encephalization" specifically refers to the brain-body ratio, which seems more directly related to the question.

Putting it all together, I think E: Encephalization is the correct answer because it directly refers to the increase in brain size relative to body size, which is a key feature of Homo erectus and later hominids. It ties directly to the question's focus on brain size changes.

The correct answer is E: Encephalization. This term refers to the significant increase in brain size relative to body size in Homo erectus, which is directly related to the evolution of larger brains in hominids.

Answer: E
