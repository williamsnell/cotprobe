Okay, I need to tackle this multiple-choice question. Let's see what it's about. The question has two statements, Statement 1 and Statement 2, and I have to evaluate each for their truthfulness. Then, based on that, I select the correct option from A to J.

Starting with Statement 1: "L2 regularization of linear models tends to make models more sparse than L1 regularization."

Wait, I remember that L1 and L2 regularization have different effects on model coefficients. L1 regularization tends to produce sparse models because it adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of coefficients, which can drive some coefficients to zero. This sparsity is useful for feature selection. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a penalty based on the square of the coefficients, which doesn't zero them out but instead spreads the coefficients out, making them smaller but not sparse. So, L2 regularization actually makes the model less sparse compared to L1. Therefore, Statement 1 is saying the opposite of what's true. So Statement 1 is False.

Moving to Statement 2: "Residual connections can be found in ResNets and Transformers."

Residual connections are a key component in ResNets (Residual Networks). They help in training deeper networks by allowing gradients to flow through the network more easily, mitigating the vanishing gradient problem. As for Transformers, they do use residual connections as well. In the architecture of Transformers, each layer typically includes a multi-head attention followed by a feed-forward network, and each of these components is followed by a residual connection and a layer normalization. So, residual connections are indeed present in both ResNets and Transformers. Therefore, Statement 2 is True.

Now, looking at the options, each option pairs the evaluation of Statement 1 (first part) and Statement 2 (second part).

Option B is "False, True". Since Statement 1 is False and Statement 2 is True, this seems to match. Let me double-check the other options to be sure.

Options:
A: False, Mostly False → No, Statement 2 is True.
B: False, True → Yes.
C: Mostly True, True → No, Statement 1 is False.
D: False, False → No.
E: True, False → No.
F: Mostly False, Mostly False → No.
G: Mostly True, False → No.
H: True, True → No.
I: True, Mostly True → No.
J: Mostly False, True → No, because Statement 1 is False, not Mostly False.

So, the correct option should be B: False, True.

The first statement is false because L2 regularization does not make models more sparse than L1; in fact, L1 leads to sparsity. The second statement is true as residual connections exist in both ResNets and Transformers.

Answer: B
