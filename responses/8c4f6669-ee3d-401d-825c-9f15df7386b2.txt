Okay, so I've got this problem about tensile strength of paper. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is asking for the probability that the sample mean X̄ is greater than 29.5 pounds per square inch. The population mean μ is 30, and the standard deviation σ is 3. The sample size n is 100.

Alright, first, I remember that when dealing with sample means, the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) comes into play. Since the sample size is 100, which is pretty large, the CLT tells us that the distribution of the sample mean should be approximately normal, regardless of the population distribution.

So, the sample mean X̄ will have a mean equal to the population mean, which is 30. The standard deviation of X̄, also known as the standard error, is σ divided by the square root of n. Let me calculate that. σ is 3, n is 100, so the square root of 100 is 10. So, 3 divided by 10 is 0.3. That means the standard error is 0.3.

Now, I need to find P(X̄ > 29.5). To do this, I'll convert X̄ into a Z-score because I want to use the standard normal distribution. The formula for the Z-score is (X̄ - μ) divided by the standard error.

Plugging in the numbers: (29.5 - 30) / 0.3. Let's compute that. 29.5 minus 30 is -0.5. Then, -0.5 divided by 0.3 is approximately -1.6667. So, the Z-score is about -1.6667.

Wait, but I want the probability that X̄ is greater than 29.5, which translates to the probability that Z is greater than -1.6667. In standard normal distribution tables, it's easier to find the area to the left of the Z-score and then subtract it from 1 to get the area to the right.

Looking up Z = -1.6667 in the standard normal table. I know that Z-scores are usually given to two decimal places, so I might look for -1.67. Let me recall the Z-table values. For Z = -1.67, the cumulative probability is about 0.0475. That means the area to the left of -1.67 is 0.0475, and the area to the right is 1 - 0.0475 = 0.9525.

Hmm, wait a second, but I'm being asked for P(X̄ > 29.5), which is the same as P(Z > -1.6667). So the probability should be 0.9525. Looking at the options, option A is 0.9522, which is very close to what I calculated. The slight difference is probably due to rounding the Z-score to two decimal places.

Let me double-check the calculations. The standard error is 3/sqrt(100)=0.3, correct. The Z-score is (29.5-30)/0.3 = -0.5/0.3 ≈ -1.6667. Yes. And the area beyond Z=-1.6667 is indeed approximately 0.9525, which rounds to 0.9522 as in option A.

I think that makes sense. So the answer should be option A: 0.9522.

The probability that the sample mean is greater than 29.5 is approximately 0.9522.
