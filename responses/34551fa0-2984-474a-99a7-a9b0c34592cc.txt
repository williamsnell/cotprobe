Okay, let's try to solve this problem. So, Mr. Jackson borrowed $150 from his bank, and he has to pay it back in 90 days with an interest rate of 6%. I need to find out how much he'll owe after 90 days.

First, I remember that interest can be calculated in a few different ways, like simple interest or compound interest. But since the problem doesn't specify, I think it's safe to assume it's simple interest because that's more common for short-term loans like this.

Simple interest is calculated using the formula: I = P * R * T. Where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time in years.

Wait, the time here is 90 days. I need to convert that into years because the interest rate is annual. So, 90 days divided by 365 days in a year. Let me calculate that: 90/365. Hmm, that's approximately 0.2466 years. Alternatively, sometimes people use 360 days for banking calculations, which would make it 90/360 = 0.25 years. I'm not sure which one to use. Maybe I should check both.

Let me first use 365 days. So T = 90/365 â‰ˆ 0.2466.

Now, P is $150, R is 6%, which is 0.06 in decimal. Plugging into the formula: I = 150 * 0.06 * 0.2466.

Let me calculate that step by step. 150 * 0.06 is 9. Then 9 * 0.2466. Let's see, 9 * 0.2466 is approximately 2.2194. So the interest would be around $2.22.

Adding that to the principal: 150 + 2.22 = $152.22. Looking at the options, I see option F is $152.25, which is close. Maybe I should check using 360 days instead.

If T is 90/360 = 0.25 years. So I = 150 * 0.06 * 0.25. Let's compute that. 150 * 0.06 is 9, then 9 * 0.25 is 2.25. So the interest is $2.25. Adding to principal: 150 + 2.25 = $152.25, which matches option F.

Wait, but why the difference? Because using 365 or 360 days changes the interest slightly. Since banks often use 360 days for calculations, maybe that's the intended method here. So the total amount due would be $152.25, which is option F.

The amount due after 90 days is calculated using simple interest. Converting 90 days to years as 0.25 (using 360 days for banking calculations), the interest is $2.25. Adding this to the principal gives $152.25.
