Question:

Marx (and the classical school) held that a commodity's value is determined by the amount of homogenous labor enbodied in the commodity. How does he reconcile thiswith the varied skills and natural abilities of people?

Options:

A: Marx differentiates between skilled and unskilled labor by the duration of labor, not by the type or quality of the work.
B: Marx computes the value of skilled labor from training costs and measures it in terms of units of unskilled labor. He averages differences in natural abilities into the term 'socially necessary labor'.
C: Marx equalizes the value of all commodities by the average amount of labor, without considering individual skill differences.
D: Marx ignores the varied skills and natural abilities of people.
E: Marx believes that the value of a commodity is determined solely by the skill level of the labor.
F: Marx suggests that natural abilities are irrelevant, as all labor is inherently equal in the creation of value.
G: Marx treats the value of labor as a reflection of the social status of the laborer, rather than the labor itself.
H: Marx uses only the most skilled labor as a benchmark for determining the value of a commodity.
I: Marx attributes a fixed value to each type of labor regardless of skill level or natural ability.
J: Marx proposes that the market adjusts the value of commodities according to the rarity of the skills required to produce them.

Okay, so I have this question about Marx's theory of value, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's break it down step by step.

The question is asking how Marx reconciles his view that a commodity's value is determined by the amount of homogeneous labor embodied in it, with the fact that people have varied skills and natural abilities. So, in other words, how does Marx account for differences in labor when calculating the value of a commodity?

From what I remember, Marx's labor theory of value states that the value of a commodity is determined by the average socially necessary labor time required to produce it. That's the part where he talks about the 'crystallized labor' in a product. But then the question comes up: what about when workers have different skills or abilities? Does that affect the value?

I think Marx distinguishes between different types of labor. He might not treat all labor as equal in terms of skill, but when calculating the value, he averages out these differences. So maybe he considers something called 'socially necessary labor,' which would account for the average effort required, regardless of individual skills.

Looking at the options:

Option A talks about duration, not type or quality. That might be part of it, but I'm not sure if that's the main point about reconciling skill differences.

Option B says he computes skilled labor based on training costs and measures it in units of unskilled labor, averaging differences into 'socially necessary labor.' That sounds plausible because it brings in the idea of converting skilled labor into an average measure.

Option C says he equalizes by average labor without considering individual skills. That seems close, but I think Marx does consider the socially necessary aspect, which includes some averaging but not ignoring individual differences entirely.

Option D says he ignores varied skills. I don't think that's right because he does talk about different types of labor, but perhaps he averages them into a standard measure.

Option E says value is determined solely by skill level, which doesn't seem correct because Marx's theory is more about the socially necessary labor regardless of skill.

Option F claims all labor is equal, which I think is more of a misunderstanding. Marx does recognize different labor qualities but measures value based on average, not equality.

Option G talks about social status, which I don't recall as a factor in Marx's value theory.

Option H uses the most skilled labor as a benchmark, but I think it's the oppositeâ€”Marx uses the average necessary labor, not the top skill level.

Option I attributes a fixed value to each labor type, regardless of skills. That doesn't seem right because the value is based on the labor's contribution to production, which varies.

Option J suggests the market adjusts based on skill rarity, but Marx's theory is more about the socially necessary labor, not market dynamics alone.

Putting it together, Option B seems to capture the idea that skilled labor is measured in terms of unskilled units and that differences are averaged into socially necessary labor. So, the answer should be B.

The correct answer is B. Marx computes the value of skilled labor based on training costs and measures it in terms of units of unskilled labor, averaging differences in natural abilities into the concept of 'socially necessary labor'.

Answer: B
