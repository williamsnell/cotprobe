Question:

Nerve outgrowth from a developing neuron begins at the growth cone, located at the tip of the axon. Microspikes of the growth cone extend and retract in order to move the growth cone forward. Exposure of the neuron to cytochasalin B at this stage of development causes

A: microtubules in the growth cone to undergo reversible dissociation
B: microtubules in the axon to undergo irreversible dissociation
C: microfilaments in the growth cone to undergo irreversible depolymerization
D: microfilaments in the axon to undergo reversible depolymerization
E: microfilaments in the microspike to undergo reversible depolymerization
F: microtubules in the microspike to undergo irreversible depolymerization
G: microfilaments in the axon to undergo irreversible depolymerization
H: microtubules in the microspike to undergo reversible depolymerization
I: microfilaments in the microspike to undergo irreversible depolymerization
J: microtubules in the axon to undergo reversible dissociation

Alright, I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about cytochalasin B and its effect on neurons. Let me go through this step by step.

First, the question says that nerve outgrowth begins at the growth cone, which is at the tip of the axon. The growth cone has these microspikes that extend and retract to move the growth cone forward. So, microspikes are probably involved in the movement and guidance of the axon during development.

The question is about what happens when a neuron is exposed to cytochalasin B. I remember that cytochalasin B is a drug that affects the cytoskeleton, particularly microfilaments. Wait, right, microfilaments are made of actin. So, cytochalasin B disrupts actin filaments.

Now, options are about microtubules and microfilaments. Since cytochalasin B targets actin, it's going to affect microfilaments, not microtubules. So, any options mentioning microtubules (like A, B, F, G, H, J) can probably be eliminated. That leaves options C, D, E, I.

Next, I need to think about what cytochalasin B does to actin. I recall that it causes the depolymerization of actin filaments. Depolymerization means breaking down the long chains into smaller units. Also, I think this effect is reversible. So, when the drug is removed, the actin filaments can reform. So, looking for depolymerization and reversible.

Looking at the options:
- C: microfilaments in growth cone, irreversible depolymerization. Hmm, but I think it's reversible.
- D: axon microfilaments, reversible depolymerization. No, because the drug affects the growth cone's microspikes, not the axon's microfilaments.
- E: microspike microfilaments, reversible depolymerization. That fits because the microspikes are part of the growth cone, and it's reversible.
- I: microspike microfilaments, irreversible. Doesn't fit because it's reversible.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the location. The question says the effect is on the growth cone's microspikes. So, the correct option should refer to microspike microfilaments undergoing depolymerization.

Option E is about microspike microfilaments undergoing reversible depolymerization. Option I is the same but irreversible. So, E is the right choice because cytochalasin B causes reversible depolymerization of actin in the microspikes, stopping their extension and retraction, thus affecting the movement of the growth cone.

Wait, but I thought cytochalasin B is known for causing the collapse of the actin network, making the microspikes disappear. So, the growth cone can't move forward anymore. So, the effect is on the microfilaments in the microspikes, and it's a reversible process because the drug can be washed away, allowing the actin to repolymerize and microspikes to reform.

So, the correct answer should be E.

The question involves the effect of cytochalasin B on a developing neuron's growth cone, which contains microspikes made of actin filaments (microfilaments). Cytochalasin B is known to disrupt actin filaments by causing depolymerization, a process that is reversible when the drug is removed. The growth cone's movement depends on the extension and retraction of these microspikes, which are critical for axon guidance.

Analyzing the options, only those mentioning microfilaments are relevant since cytochalasin B does not affect microtubules. Among the microfilament options, the correct effect is on the microspikes of the growth cone, causing reversible depolymerization. This matches option E, as it specifically refers to the microspike microfilaments undergoing reversible depolymerization, which aligns with the known action of cytochalasin B.

Answer: E
