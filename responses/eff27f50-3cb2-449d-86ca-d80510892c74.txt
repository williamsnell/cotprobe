Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric force on a charged block in an electric field. Hmm, let's see. The block has a mass, but wait, actually the mass probably doesn't matter here because the question is about the electrostatic force, which depends on charge and electric field, not mass. Oh right, because F = qE, yeah.

So the given charge is +8.00e-5 C. The electric field is given as (3000 i -600 j) N/C. I think the formula is F = q * E, but since E is a vector, I'll have to calculate the components separately and then find the magnitude of the resultant force.

Wait, the charge is positive, so the force direction will be the same as the electric field. But since the question only asks for magnitude, direction doesn't matter. So I just need to calculate each component.

Let me break it down. The electric field has two components: 3000 in the i-direction and -600 in the j-direction. So for each, I'll multiply by the charge.

First component (i): F_i = q * E_i = 8e-5 C * 3000 N/C. Let me calculate that. 8e-5 times 3000. 8e-5 is 0.00008. 0.00008 * 3000 = 0.24 N. So F_i is 0.24 N.

Second component (j): F_j = q * E_j = 8e-5 C * (-600 N/C). Let's compute that. 8e-5 * 600 is 0.048, but since it's negative, F_j is -0.048 N.

Now, the total force vector F is (0.24 i - 0.048 j) N. To find the magnitude, I use the Pythagorean theorem. So |F| = sqrt( (0.24)^2 + (-0.048)^2 ).

Calculating each square: 0.24 squared is 0.0576. 0.048 squared is 0.002304. Adding them gives 0.0576 + 0.002304 = 0.059904. Taking the square root, sqrt(0.059904) is approximately 0.2448 N.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the calculations. 8e-5 times 3000 is 8e-5 * 3e3 = 8 * 3 * 1e-2 = 24 * 0.01 = 0.24 N. That's correct.

And 8e-5 * 600 is 8e-5 * 6e2 = 8 * 6 * 1e-3 = 48e-3 = 0.048 N, but since E is negative, it's -0.048.

So the components are correct. Now the magnitude: sqrt( (0.24)^2 + (0.048)^2 ) = sqrt(0.0576 + 0.002304) = sqrt(0.059904). Hmm, what's sqrt(0.059904)? Let's calculate that.

I know that 0.2449 squared is approximately 0.0599 because (0.2449)^2 ≈ 0.06. Wait, let me compute 0.2448^2: 0.2448 * 0.2448. Let's do this step by step.

0.24 * 0.24 is 0.0576. Then, the next digits, but perhaps a better approach is to compute 0.2448^2.

Let me approximate: 0.2448 * 0.2448 ≈ (0.24 + 0.0048)^2 = 0.24^2 + 2*0.24*0.0048 + 0.0048^2. So 0.0576 + 0.002304 + 0.00002304 ≈ 0.0576 + 0.002304 = 0.059904, plus a tiny bit. So sqrt(0.059904) is about 0.2448 N.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.245 N, which matches closely. So the answer should be A.

The magnitude of the electrostatic force is calculated using the formula \( F = q \cdot E \), where \( q \) is the charge and \( E \) is the electric field. The electric field has components \( E_x = 3000 \, \mathrm{N/C} \) and \( E_y = -600 \, \mathrm{N/C} \). 

1. Compute the force components:
   - \( F_x = q \cdot E_x = 8.00 \times 10^{-5} \, \mathrm{C} \cdot 3000 \, \mathrm{N/C} = 0.24 \, \mathrm{N} \)
   - \( F_y = q \cdot E_y = 8.00 \times 10^{-5} \, \mathrm{C} \cdot (-600 \, \mathrm{N/C}) = -0.048 \, \mathrm{N} \)

2. Calculate the magnitude of the resultant force using the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   |F| = \sqrt{F_x^2 + F_y^2} = \sqrt{(0.24)^2 + (-0.048)^2} = \sqrt{0.0576 + 0.002304} = \sqrt{0.059904} \approx 0.245 \, \mathrm{N}
   \]

The closest option is **A: 0.245 N**.
