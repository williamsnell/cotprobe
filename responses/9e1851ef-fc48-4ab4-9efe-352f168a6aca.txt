Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about propositional logic (PL) symbolization. The sentence given is "Everybody loves Raymond, or not." I need to figure out which of the options A through I correctly represents this sentence in PL.

First, I should break down the sentence. The main structure seems to be "A or not A," where A is "Everybody loves Raymond." In formal logic, "A or not A" is a tautology, meaning it's always true. It's equivalent to saying "Either A is true, or if it's not, then it's still covered." So, in PL terms, this would be A ∨ ~A.

Looking at the options:

A: L → ~L. This translates to "If L then not L," which is a contradiction, always false. Doesn't fit because the sentence is a tautology.

B: ~L • L. This is the conjunction of not L and L, which is also a contradiction. Same issue as A.

C: L ∨ ~L. This is exactly "L or not L," which is a tautology. This seems correct.

D: L. Just L, which is a simple statement but doesn't capture the "or not" part.

E: L ∧ L. This is L and L, which is just L, so it doesn't fit.

F: L • ~L. This is L and not L, another contradiction.

G: ~L → L. This is "If not L then L," which is equivalent to L ∨ ~L in implication form, but it's not the direct "A or not A" structure. Wait, actually, in logic, ~L → L is equivalent to L ∨ ~L because implications can be rewritten with disjunctions. So this might also be a correct symbolization. Hmm, I need to think about that.

H: ~L ∧ ~L. This is just ~L, but with two instances, which is the same as ~L.

I: ~L. This just says "Not L," which doesn't include the "or" part.

Wait, so the original sentence is "A or not A," which is a tautology. So the correct symbolization should be L ∨ ~L, which is option C. But option G is ~L → L, which is logically equivalent to L ∨ ~L because in logic, an implication P → Q is equivalent to ~P ∨ Q. So ~L → L becomes L ∨ ~L. So both C and G are equivalent. But looking at the options, the question is about symbolization. The original sentence is expressed as a disjunction, so the direct symbolization would be C. However, in some contexts, people might express "A or not A" using implication, but I think the most straightforward is the disjunction.

Wait, but the question is asking for the "best" symbolization. Since the sentence is "A or not A," the direct translation is A ∨ ~A, which is option C. So the answer should be C.

The sentence "Everybody loves Raymond, or not" is a tautology expressed as "A or not A." In propositional logic, this translates directly to \( A \lor \neg A \). Among the options, \( L \lor \neg L \) (option C) is the correct and most straightforward representation. While \( \neg L \rightarrow L \) (option G) is logically equivalent, the direct symbolization of "A or not A" is the disjunction form.

Answer: C
