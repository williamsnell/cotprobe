Okay, so I have this question about a logical fallacy, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read it carefully.

The question says: "Arguing that what is true of an entire object is also true of each part of that object is the fallacy of..." Then there are ten options given from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that logical fallacies are errors in reasoning that can make arguments weak or misleading. The question is about a specific type where someone assumes that if something is true for the whole, it must be true for each part. I think this is a common fallacy, but I'm not exactly sure which one it is.

Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A: Appeal to ignorance. That's when someone argues that a claim is true because there's no evidence against it. Doesn't seem to fit here.

Option B: Straw man. This is when someone misrepresents an opponent's argument to make it easier to attack. Not related to parts and wholes.

Option C: Bandwagon. That's the fallacy where the argument is based on popularity, like "everyone does it, so it's right." Doesn't match.

Option D: Division. Hmm, division... I think division is when you assume that the properties of a whole apply to each part. That sounds exactly like what the question is describing. So this might be the answer.

Option E: False cause. This is when someone assumes that because one event happened after another, the first caused the second. Not relevant here.

Option F: Slippery slope. This is the idea that a small step will lead to a chain of negative events. Doesn't fit.

Option G: False criteria. I'm not too sure about this one. Maybe when wrong standards are used for evaluation, but not directly related to parts and wholes.

Option H: Hasty generalization. That's making a broad claim based on insufficient evidence. For example, assuming all swans are white because you've only seen white swans. But this isn't exactly the same as the question, which is about parts of an object.

Option I: Ad hominem. This is attacking the person instead of the argument. Like saying someone's argument is wrong because they're not smart. Doesn't match.

Option J: Ad crumenam. I'm not familiar with this term. Maybe it's a less common fallacy, but I'm not sure what it involves. Probably not the answer.

So, going back, the fallacy in the question is when someone assumes that what's true of the whole is true of each part. That sounds like the fallacy of division. So the answer should be D: division.

I think that's right because division is about breaking things down and incorrectly applying the whole's properties to each part. Yeah, that fits.

The fallacy described in the question is the fallacy of division, which occurs when someone assumes that what is true of a whole must also be true of each of its parts. This matches option D.

Answer: D
