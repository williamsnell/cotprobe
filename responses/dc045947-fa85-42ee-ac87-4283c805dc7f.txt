Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this economics question. The question is about finding the least-cost combination of labor and capital for a firm. Let me go through each option step by step.

The question asks what a firm must do to hire the least-cost combination. I remember that in economics, firms aim to minimize their costs while producing a certain output. This involves using the optimal mix of inputs, like labor and capital, such that the marginal product per dollar spent on each input is equal. That makes sense because if one input is giving more productivity per unit cost than another, the firm should reallocate resources to the more efficient input until both are equally efficient in terms of marginal productivity per cost.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the total cost of labor equals total cost of capital. Hmm, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's the least cost. It's possible that one input is more productive, so using more of it could lead to lower total cost without equalizing the total costs of each. So A might not be correct.

Option B suggests the marginal product of labor equals the marginal product of capital. I thought that wasn't quite right because the firm should also consider the prices of labor and capital. It's about the ratio of marginal products to their prices, not just the products themselves. So B might not be the right choice.

Option C states the ratio of marginal product of labor to the price of labor is equal to one. That doesn't sound right. I think it's more about the ratio of marginal products divided by their respective prices being equal, not each being one. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D says the price of labor equals the price of capital. But prices can vary, and the firm doesn't necessarily need them to be equal. It's the marginal products relative to their prices that matter. So D is likely wrong.

Option E is about the marginal product of labor divided by the price of capital equaling the marginal product of capital divided by the price of labor. Wait, that seems off because the formula I remember is ( MPL / w ) = ( MPK / r ), where w is the wage and r is the rental rate. So E seems to mix the prices incorrectly. It's MPL/w equals MPK/r, not MPL/price of capital. So E might not be correct either.

Option F: price of labor less than price of capital. That doesn't directly relate to the least-cost condition. The firm would use both as long as the productivity per price is equal, regardless of which is cheaper. So F is probably not the answer.

Option G: ratio of MPL to MPK is one. That would mean MPL equals MPK, but again, without considering their prices. So G isn't the right approach.

Option H: MPL equals the price of labor. That doesn't sound familiar. The condition involves marginal products relative to prices, not just equaling the price. So H is likely incorrect.

Option I: MPL greater than MPK. This suggests one input is more productive than the other, but the firm should adjust until they're equally efficient per cost. So I don't think I is the correct condition.

Option J: MPL divided by price of labor equals MPK divided by price of capital. This matches the formula I remember: (MPL/w) = (MPK/r). So J seems to be the correct answer.

I think I might have made a mistake earlier with option E. Let me double-check. Option E says MPL/price of capital equals MPK/price of labor. That's (MPL/r) = (MPK/w), which is the reciprocal of what we need. The correct condition is (MPL/w) = (MPK/r), so J is definitely the right choice.

The correct answer is the one that matches the condition where the marginal product per unit cost of labor equals the marginal product per unit cost of capital. This ensures the firm is using resources efficiently. 

Answer: J
