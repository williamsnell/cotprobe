Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this question about peak flow readings. The question is asking within how many liters per minute the three readings should be of each other when recording peak flow results. The options are from A to J, with different numbers ranging from 10 to 90.

Hmm, I remember that peak flow meters are used by people with asthma to measure how well their lungs are functioning. They take multiple readings, usually three, and the highest one is typically recorded. But the question here is about the variation between the three readings, not necessarily the highest value.

I think the key here is about consistency. If the readings vary too much, it might indicate that the user isn't using the peak flow meter correctly or that there's variability in their asthma control. So, the acceptable range for the difference between the readings is something I need to recall.

I believe the standard recommendation is that the readings should not vary by more than a certain amount. I think it's around 20 liters per minute. Let me think... Yes, I remember reading that if the three readings vary by no more than 20% or a set number like 20 liters, then it's considered consistent. So, for example, if someone's normal peak flow is 400 liters per minute, a variation of 20 would be 40 above or below, but I'm not sure if it's a fixed number or percentage-based.

Wait, the options here are fixed numbers, not percentages. So the question is asking for the maximum difference between the three readings in liters per minute. I think the usual advice is that the readings should be within 20 liters of each other. That would mean option G, which is 20 liters per minute.

Let me double-check. I recall that in spirometry and peak flow measurements, a variability of around 10-20% is acceptable. But since the options here are in fixed liters, not percentages, 20 liters seems right. So the correct answer should be G: 20 litres per minute.

The acceptable variation between three peak flow readings is typically around 20 liters per minute. This ensures consistency and correct usage of the peak flow meter.

Answer: G
