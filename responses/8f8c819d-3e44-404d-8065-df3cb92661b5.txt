Okay, so I've got this problem here about a loan from The Last National Bank. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The loan was approved with an interest rate of 6% for 90 days, and the interest charge is $36. I need to find the principal of the loan.

Wait, right. The formula for simple interest is I = P * R * T, where I is the interest, P is the principal, R is the rate, and T is the time in years. Oh wait, but the time here is in days. So I need to convert 90 days into years. Since 90 days is 3 months, that's 3/12 or 0.25 years. Hmm, 90 divided by 365 is approximately 0.246575 years. Let me double-check that. 90 divided by 365 equals roughly 0.2466. So T is about 0.2466 years.

Now, the rate R is 6%, which is 0.06 in decimal. The interest I is $36. So plugging into the formula: 36 = P * 0.06 * 0.2466. Let me calculate the multiplication of 0.06 and 0.2466 first. 0.06 times 0.2466 is 0.014796. So the equation becomes 36 = P * 0.014796.

To find P, I need to divide 36 by 0.014796. Let me do that calculation. 36 divided by 0.014796. Hmm, 36 ÷ 0.014796... Let me approximate. Well, 0.014796 is approximately 0.0148, so I can think of it as 36 / 0.0148. Let's compute that. 36 ÷ 0.0148 ≈ 2449.4 (but wait, let me do it more accurately). 0.0148 times 2449 is approximately 36. So 2449.4 would be the P. Hmm, but that doesn't match any of the options. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me try a different approach. Let's calculate 36 divided by 0.014796. Using a calculator method, 36 ÷ 0.014796. Let me compute this: 

0.014796 * 2449 = 36. So P would be approximately $2449.4. But looking at the options, the closest is D: $2800, H: $1800, J: $2400, E: $3200, etc. Wait, none of the options exactly match 2449. But let me check if I did the calculation correctly.

Wait a second, perhaps the time is in months. Oh wait, 90 days is 3 months, which is 0.25 years. So that part is correct. Another possibility is whether the interest is compounded or simple. But the question says "interest charge," which usually refers to simple interest. Unless it's compounded, but the question doesn't specify. So I think it's safe to assume simple interest.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake with the calculation. Let me redo it. 36 = P * 0.06 * (90/365). Let me compute (90/365) first. 90 divided by 365 equals approximately 0.246575. So 0.06 * 0.246575 = 0.0147945.

So 36 = P * 0.0147945.

So P = 36 / 0.0147945 ≈ 2449.4. Hmm, that's not matching any of the options. Wait, perhaps I should check if 90 days is 90/365 years. Yes, that's correct. So 90/365 is approximately 0.246575.

Wait, perhaps the question assumes 360 days in a year? Let me try that. 90 days divided by 360 is 0.25. So then 0.06 * 0.25 = 0.015. So 36 = P * 0.015. Then P = 36 / 0.015 = 2400. Ah! So that would give P as $2400, which is option J. So that must be the case because the problem doesn't specify whether to use 360 or 365 days. But typically, when dealing with simple interest in exams, they use 365 days unless otherwise stated.

Wait, but the calculation with 90/365 gives me around $2449.4, which isn't an option. But using 90/360 gives exactly $2400, which is option J.

Wait, but let me double-check the time calculation. 90 days is 3 months. 3 months is 0.25 years. So 90/365 is approximately 0.246575. So the formula uses that time. So with that, 36 = P * 0.06 * 0.246575 → P = 36/(0.06*0.246575) = 36/(0.0147945) ≈ 2449.4, which is not an option. So perhaps the question intended to use 360 days. Alternatively, perhaps the time is in months. Wait, 90 days is 3 months, which is 0.25 years. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed to approximate. Maybe 90/360 equals 0.25, which would give us the correct answer as option J. That would make sense because the other options don't align with 90/365 calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that 90 days is 90/365, so let me calculate the exact value.

Wait, 90/365 = 0.2465753425. Then 0.06 * 0.2465753425 = 0.01479452056.

So 36 divided by 0.01479452056 equals approximately 2449.4 dollars. But the options don't have that. Let me look at the options again: A: 3000, B:2600, C:2200, D:2800, E:3200, F:2000, G:2100, H:1800, I:2500, J:2400.

Hmm, none of these are near 2449. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the interest is not based on the principal. Oh wait, no, simple interest formula is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question uses a different formula, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the time is in months, but no, the formula uses years.

Wait, maybe I should think of the time in months. 90 days is 3 months. So 3 months is 3/12 = 0.25 years. So I think that's correct.

Another thought: perhaps the interest is compounded annually, but that's not standard. Also, the problem says 'interest charge', which usually refers to simple interest.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations. Let me do 36 ÷ (0.06 * 90/365) again.

Let me calculate 90/365 = approx 0.246575.

Then, 0.06 * 0.246575 = 0.0147945.

So 36 ÷ 0.0147945 ≈ 2449.4.

But this is not an option. So perhaps the question uses a different approach, such as daily interest rates. Wait, no, the rate is 6% per annum, so per day, it's higher, but the formula is for annual percentage rates.

Wait, perhaps the question meant to use 360 days. Let's check. 90/360 = 0.25. So 0.06 * 0.25 = 0.015.

So 36 = P * 0.015 → P = 36 / 0.015 = 2400. So that's option J.

So maybe the answer is J: $2400, which is one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects you to use 365 days.

Wait, but why isn't 2449.4 an option? The options given are 3000, 2600, 2200, 2800, 3200, 2000, 2100, 1800, 2500, 2400.

So, 2449 is between 2400 and 2500. None of the options are around 2449 except J:2400 and I:2500.

Wait, but perhaps the question expects you to use the exact 90-day period, which is 3 months, but 90 days is 3 months, but the rate is annual. So 90/365 is about 0.2466. So perhaps I should compute 36 ÷ (0.06 * 0.2466) exactly.

Wait, let me compute 0.06 * 0.2466 = 0.014796.

36 ÷ 0.014796 = ?

Let me compute 36 ÷ 0.014796.

I can do this as 36 ÷ 0.014796 = ?

Alternatively, 36 * (1/0.014796) = 36 * approximately 67.65. Because 1/0.0147945 ≈67.65.

So 36 * 67.65 ≈ 36 * 67 = 2412, and 36 * 0.65 = 23.4. So total ≈ 2412 +23.4 =2435.4. Hmm, that's about 2435.4, which is near 2449.4, but that's not an option. So none of the options match this.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check. The formula is I = P * R * T.

Wait, maybe the time is in days, so T=90/365. So 90/365 is 0.246575.

So T is correct. R is 6% which is 0.06.

So I = 36 = P * 0.06 * 0.246575

So P = 36 / (0.06 * 0.246575) = 36 / 0.0147945 ≈ 2449.4, which is not an option.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate the interest as (P * 6%) * (90/365). Let me compute that.

So, the annual interest would be P * 0.06. For 90 days, (P * 0.06) * (90/365) = I. So 36 = P * 0.06 * (90/365). So P = 36 / (0.06 * 90/365). Let me compute 0.06*90/365 = 5.4 / 365 = 0.0147945. So same as before. P=36 / 0.0147945 ≈ 2449.4.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should check the options again. Let me look:

Options:

A: 3000

B:2600

C:2200

D:2800

E:3200

F:2000

G:2100

H:1800

I:2500

J:2400

So, none of these options are near 2449. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the interest is calculated using simple interest, but the time is in days, so maybe 90/365 is 0.246575, as before. So 0.06 * 0.246575 = 0.0147945. So 36 = P * 0.0147945 → P = 36 / 0.0147945 ≈2449.4.

Hmm. So this doesn't match any options. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. Oh wait, option J is 2400, which is close. So perhaps it's 2400, and the approximate value is 2449, but perhaps the options have rounded numbers.

Wait, maybe the question intended to use 360 days. Let me check that.

If T is 90/360 = 0.25, then 0.06 * 0.25 = 0.015. So 36 = P * 0.015 → P = 36 / 0.015 = 2400, which is option J.

So perhaps the question expects you to use 360 days, as that's a common day count convention. Otherwise, the correct answer isn't in the options, but if we have to choose between the given options, then J is 2400, which is the closest to 2449.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the interest is calculated with simple interest, but perhaps the time is 90/365, but I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me try to compute 36 divided by (0.06 multiplied by 90/365).

Let me compute 0.06 * 90/365 first.

90/365 equals approximately 0.2465753425. Multiply by 0.06 → 0.01479452056.

So 36 divided by 0.01479452056 is approximately 2449.4.

Hmm. So that's not an option. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not present, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the interest is 6% per annum, but the time is 90 days. So the rate is 6% per year, so per day it's 6%/365. So 6/365 is approximately 0.016438%.

Wait, no, the formula is for annual rate. So perhaps I should just proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different formula. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: if I consider simple interest, then I = P * R * T. So P = I / (R * T).

So R is 6% per annum, so 0.06. T is 90/365.

So P = 36 / (0.06 * (90/365)).

Compute denominator: 0.06 * (90/365) = (6/100)*(90/365) = (540)/(36500) = 54/3650 = 27/1825 ≈0.01479452.

So P=36/0.01479452 ≈2449.4.

But since this isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer is not here. But wait, perhaps I should recheck the initial question.

Wait, the question says "the last national bank has just approved a loan at an interest rate of 6% for 90 days. If the interest charge on the loan is $36, how much is the principal of the loan?"

So, the options are A:3000, B:2600, C:2200, D:2800, E:3200, F:2000, G:2100, H:1800, I:2500, J:2400.

Hmm, 2449.4 is not present. So perhaps the question intended to use a different method, like annual basis but that's not matching.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the calculation uses 90 days as 90 * 0.06, but that would be 5.4, and then 5.4 times T, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the question is using simple interest but the days are treated differently. Alternatively, perhaps it's a simple interest with 90 days, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it using the exact formula in another way. Let me try to compute the daily rate and then calculate the interest.

The annual rate is 6%, so the daily rate is 6% / 365 = 0.016438%.

So the interest for 90 days would be 90 * 0.016438% = 90 * 0.00016438 = 0.0147945.

So I = P * 0.0147945.

So P = 36 / 0.0147945 ≈2449.4.

So again, not matching any option.

Wait, but perhaps the question has a typo, and it's intended to have 90/360 = 0.25, which would give P=2400, option J.

So in that case, the correct answer is J:2400.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's options have a mistake, but looking at the options, J is the closest to 2449.4.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the question is using the same 90 days as 90/365, but perhaps the calculation is done differently.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the principal as follows: P = I / (R * T). So R is 6% per year, T is 90/365, so R*T = 6% * 90/365 = 6 * 90 / (365 * 100) = 540 / 36500 = 54/3650 = 27/1825 ≈0.01479452.

So P = 36 / 0.01479452 ≈2449.4.

So the correct answer is approximately 2449.4, which isn't an option. But looking at the options, J is 2400, which is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to have the time as 90/365, but the options have a typo, and J is correct.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the answer is J:2400.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have the time as 3 months (90 days), but the options don't have a number close to 2449.4.

Hmm. So I think that perhaps the correct answer is J:2400, given that it's the closest option and the calculation using 3 months (90 days) is 2400. So I'll go with J:2400.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me check once again. The formula is I = P * R * T. So, if I want to find P, it's P = I / (R * T).

So R is 6% per annum, so in decimal, 0.06.

T is 90/365 days.

So P = 36 / (0.06 * (90/365)).

Compute denominator: 0.06 * (90/365) = (6/100)*(90/365) = (540)/(36500) = 54/3650 = 27/1825 ≈0.01479452.

So P = 36 / 0.01479452 ≈2449.4.

So, no option is near that. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it with 90/365 exactly. Let me compute 36 ÷ (0.06 * (90/365)).

Compute 90/365 = 0.2465753425.

0.06 * 0.2465753425 = 0.01479452056.

So 36 ÷ 0.01479452056 = ?

Let me compute this as 36 ÷ 0.01479452056 = 2449.4.

Hmm. So again, same result.

So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to use a different time, like 90/360, which is 0.25, leading to P=2400, option J.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the use of 365 days, which would yield P=2400.

So perhaps the correct answer is J:2400.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in the options, and the correct answer is not there.

But given that, perhaps I should choose the closest option, which is J:2400.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the problem has a typo, and perhaps the interest is $36, which could be a typo, but given the options, I think J:2400 is the intended correct answer.
</think>

The correct answer is J: $2400. 

**Explanation:**

Using the simple interest formula: 
\[ I = P \times R \times T \]
where:
- \( I = \$36 \) (interest),
- \( R = 6\% \) (annual interest rate),
- \( T = \frac{90}{365} \) (time in years).

Rearranging to solve for \( P \):
\[ P = \frac{I}{R \times T} \]

Calculating \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{90}{365} \approx 0.246575 \]

Now, compute \( R \times T \):
\[ R \times T = 0.06 \times 0.246575 \approx 0.0147945 \]

Finally, solve for \( P \):
\[ P = \frac{36}{0.0147945} \approx 2449.4 \]

Since \( 2449.4 \) is not an option, the closest available option is \( 2400 \) (option J). 

**Answer:** J: $2400
