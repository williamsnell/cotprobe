Okay, I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about rabbinical commentaries after the Mishnah. The question is asking what those commentaries are called, with options from A to J. Let me go through each option one by one to see which one fits.

First, I know the Mishnah is one of the earliest rabbinic texts, a collection of Jewish oral laws. After the Mishnah, there were other commentaries and expansions. I remember that the Talmud is a later work that includes the Mishnah and the Gemarah. Wait, so the Gemarah is part of the Talmud. But the question is specifically about the commentaries produced after the Mishnah. So maybe the answer is the Gemarah itself because it's the part of the Talmud that comes after the Mishnah.

Let me check the options. Option G is Gemarah. That seems right because the Talmud is made up of Mishnah and Gemarah. The Gemarah is the commentary and analysis by later rabbis, so it's the direct answer.

Looking at the other options: A is Midrash, which I think are collections of rabbinic interpretations of the Torah, but they might have been around before or alongside the Mishnah. B is Tanakh, which is the Hebrew Bible, not a commentary. C is Zohar, a kabbalistic text, probably later. D is Yeshiva, which refers to a place of learning, not a text. E is Haftarah, which are additional readings in synagogue, not commentaries. F is Torah, again the text itself. H is Haggadah, which is part of the Passover service. I is Septuagint, a Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible. J is Talmud, which includes both Mishnah and Gemarah, but the question is about what they're called after the Mishnah, so probably the Gemarah part.

So I think the correct answer is G: Gemarah.

The correct answer is G: Gemarah. The Gemarah, part of the Talmud, consists of rabbinical commentaries and interpretations following the Mishnah.
