Okay, so I need to find the cost of a television that's selling for $226.50 with a 30% markup based on the cost. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First, I remember that markup is the amount added to the cost to get the selling price. So the selling price is the cost plus 30% of the cost. Another way to put it is that the selling price is 130% of the cost because 100% is the original cost and 30% is the markup.

So, mathematically, I can write this as:
Selling Price = Cost + (30% of Cost)
Or, SP = C + 0.30C
Which simplifies to SP = 1.30C

I know the selling price is $226.50, so I can plug that into the equation:
226.50 = 1.30 * C

To find the cost, I need to solve for C. That means I should divide both sides of the equation by 1.30. Let me do that.

C = 226.50 / 1.30

Let me calculate that. Hmm, 226.50 divided by 1.30. I can think of it as 2265 divided by 13, since I can multiply numerator and denominator by 10 to eliminate the decimal. 

Wait, 13 times 174 is 2262 because 13*170=2210 and 13*4=52, so 2210+52=2262. Then 2265-2262=3, so it's 174 with a remainder of 3, which is 3/13. So as a decimal, 3/13 is approximately 0.2308. So 174.2308.

Rounding that, it's approximately $174.23. Wait, but let me check my calculation again because sometimes I might make a mistake with division.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute it step by step. Let's see:

1.30 times what equals 226.50.

Let me try 174.23 times 1.30.

174.23 * 1 = 174.23

174.23 * 0.30 = let's calculate that. 174.23 * 0.3 is 52.269.

Adding them together: 174.23 + 52.269 = 226.499, which is approximately $226.50. So that checks out.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is $174.23. So that's the correct answer. Let me just make sure none of the other options are close. The next closest might be option A: $190.20, but that's higher than D. So D must be the right choice.

The cost is calculated by dividing the selling price by 1.30, resulting in approximately $174.23.

Answer: D
