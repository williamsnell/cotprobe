Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many labeled graphs have a score of (6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2). Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that in graph theory, the score sequence of a graph is a list of its vertices' degrees. The score sequence given here is (6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2). So there are seven vertices in total because there are seven numbers in the score. The first vertex has a degree of 6, which means it's connected to every other vertex. The rest of the six vertices each have a degree of 2.

Wait, if the first vertex is connected to all six others, then each of those six must have at least one connection from the first vertex. But their degrees are 2, so each of them must have exactly one more connection. Since they can't connect to the first vertex again (as that would make their degree 2, but they can only have one more connection beyond the first), they must connect to exactly one other vertex.

But wait, no, that's not right. Each degree of 2 means they have two connections. One is already to the first vertex, so they need one more. So each of these six vertices needs to connect to exactly one other vertex in the remaining five.

But wait, the problem is that if each of the six vertices needs exactly one more connection, we might end up with a situation where they form a set of edges among themselves. But since each can only have one more connection, the total number of edges among the six is (6 * 1)/2 = 3 edges. Because each edge connects two vertices.

So, the question now is: how many ways can we arrange three edges among six vertices such that each vertex has exactly one edge (i.e., forming a perfect matching of three edges). Because each of the six has degree 1 in this subgraph.

Wait, no. Wait, each of the six has degree 2 in the entire graph. Since they're already connected to the first vertex (degree 6), each has one more edge. So the subgraph induced by these six vertices must be a 1-regular graph, meaning each vertex has exactly one edge. A 1-regular graph on six vertices is a perfect matching, which consists of three disjoint edges.

So, the problem reduces to finding how many perfect matchings there are on six vertices. The number of perfect matchings in a complete graph of 2n vertices is (2n-1)!!, where !! is the double factorial. For n=3 (6 vertices), that's 5!! = 5×3×1 = 15. But wait, no, wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the number of perfect matchings in a set of 6 elements is calculated as (6)!)/(2^3 * 3!) = (720)/(8*6) )= 720/48=15. So yes, 15 possible perfect matchings.

But wait, does this apply here? Because in our case, the subgraph must be a perfect matching. So the total number of such graphs would be the number of ways to arrange these three edges among the six vertices, which is 15.

Wait, but the question is about labeled graphs. So each label is distinct, and the order matters. So each perfect matching is a distinct labeled graph.

Wait, but wait a second. Another approach: since the first vertex is connected to all six, the remaining six form a graph where each has degree 1. So the number of such graphs is the number of ways to partition the six vertices into three pairs, which is (6-1)!! = 15. So that's 15.

But wait, the options don't have 15 as the correct answer. Wait, the options are A:35, B:20, C:25, D:18, E:30, F:24, G:40, H:12, I:15, J:10.

So option I is 15. But wait, I'm not sure if I'm missing something here. Because sometimes when dealing with labeled graphs, there might be more constraints.

Wait, another thought: the score sequence must be graphical. So we should check if the given score is graphical. The Havel-Hakimi theorem says that a degree sequence is graphical if and only if the sequence obtained by deleting the first element (the largest degree) and subtracting 1 from each of the next d1 elements is graphical.

So let's apply Havel-Hakimi to the sequence (6,2,2,2,2,2,2).

We remove the first element (6), and subtract 1 from the next six elements. So the next six elements are all 2, subtracting 1 gives 1 each. So the new sequence is (1,1,1,1,1,1). Now, is this sequence graphical? Yes, because it's a sequence of six 1s, which corresponds to a perfect matching, as we discussed earlier.

So the sequence is graphical, and the number of labeled graphs is the number of ways to arrange the edges as we discussed: 15.

So the answer should be I:15.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because another approach might lead to a different number. Let me think again.

Wait, the first vertex is connected to all six, so the remaining six must form a 1-regular graph. The number of 1-regular labeled graphs on six vertices is indeed 15, as we calculated. So the total number of labeled graphs with this score is 15.

So the correct option is I:15.

The score sequence (6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2) corresponds to a graph with seven vertices. The first vertex has degree 6, meaning it is connected to all other six vertices. Each of the remaining six vertices has degree 2, so after connecting to the first vertex, they each need exactly one more connection. This forms a 1-regular subgraph among the six vertices, which is a perfect matching. The number of perfect matchings on six vertices is 15. Therefore, there are 15 labeled graphs with this score.
