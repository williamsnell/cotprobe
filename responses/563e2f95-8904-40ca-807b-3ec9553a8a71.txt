Okay, so I've got this problem here: "In how many ways can 8 people be seated at 2 identical round tables? Each table must have at least 1 person seated." The options are from A to J, with numbers like 15000, 40320, and others. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that when arranging people around round tables, the number of arrangements is different from straight line arrangements because rotations are considered the same. For a single round table with n people, the number of distinct seating arrangements is (n-1)! because fixing one person's position accounts for the rotational symmetry.

But here, it's two tables, and they're identical. So, I think I need to consider how to split the 8 people into two groups and then arrange each group around their respective tables. Also, since the tables are identical, the order in which I assign the groups to the tables doesn't matter. That is, splitting into group A and group B is the same as group B and group A because the tables are identical.

So, the problem can be broken down into two main parts: partitioning the 8 people into two non-empty groups and then calculating the number of ways to seat each group around their respective tables.

First, I need to figure out how many ways to split 8 people into two groups. Since the tables are identical, the split is unordered. So, the number of ways to split 8 people into two groups of k and (8-k) is C(8,k), but since the groups are indistinct, I should divide by 2 to avoid double-counting. Wait, but actually, for each possible split where k ≠ (8-k), we have to count it once, but when k = (8-k), like in the case of 4 and 4, we have to count it once instead of twice.

Wait, but in this case, since each table must have at least one person, the possible splits are from 1 and 7, 2 and 6, 3 and 5, and 4 and 4. So, for each split except 4 and 4, they come in pairs (like 1-7 and 7-1, but since tables are identical, these are the same). So, the number of distinct ways to split is (2^7 - 2)/2, which is the number of ways to partition into two non-empty subsets, divided by 2 because the tables are identical. Wait, perhaps a better way is to calculate the number of ways to split the group, considering the indistinctness of the tables.

Alternatively, another approach is to consider that for each possible split, the number of ways is C(8,k) for k from 1 to 7, but since the tables are identical, each split is counted twice except when k = 4. So, the total number of splits is (sum from k=1 to 7 of C(8,k))/2. Wait, but that's not exactly right because when k=4, the split is the same when you swap the groups. So, the total number of ways to split is [C(8,1) + C(8,2) + C(8,3) + C(8,4)] / something? Hmm, maybe I should think differently.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the number of ways to partition the 8 people into two groups, where the order doesn't matter because the tables are identical. So, for each possible group size k (from 1 to 7), the number of ways to choose k people is C(8,k). But since the tables are identical, choosing group A as k and group B as 8-k is the same as group B as k and group A as 8-k. So, for each k from 1 to 3, we have C(8,k), and for k=4, it's just C(8,4)/2, but wait, no, because when k=4, C(8,4) counts each split twice (once as group A and once as group B). So, the total number of ways to split is [C(8,1) + C(8,2) + C(8,3) + (C(8,4)/2)].

Wait, but maybe that's complicating things. Let me think again. The number of ways to split 8 people into two groups where order doesn't matter is equal to the number of subsets of size k where k < 4, because for each k <4, the split is unique. Because when k=4, it's the same as 8-4, so we have to count it once. So, the number of ways to split is:

sum from k=1 to 3 of C(8,k) + 1 (for k=4). Because C(8,4)/2 would give the number of ways when considering identical tables. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, the number of ways to split into two non-empty groups, considering that the tables are identical, is equal to (2^8 - 2)/2. Because each person can be assigned to either table, but we subtract the two cases where all are on one table, and then divide by 2 because swapping the tables doesn't create a new arrangement. So, (256 - 2)/2 = 254/2 = 127. So, there are 127 ways to split the 8 people into two non-empty groups, considering the tables identical.

Wait, but that seems off. Let me check again. The number of ways to assign each of the 8 people to one of two tables is 2^8 = 256. But we must exclude the cases where all are on one table, which are 2 (all on table 1 or all on table 2). So, 256 - 2 = 254. Now, since the tables are identical, each split is counted twice in this number (once as table A and table B, and once as table B and table A). So, the number of distinct splits is 254 / 2 = 127, as I thought earlier.

So, there are 127 ways to split the 8 people into two non-empty groups. Now, for each split, we need to calculate the number of seating arrangements around the two tables.

For each split into k and (8 -k), the number of ways to seat them is (k-1)! * (8 -k -1)! because each round table's arrangements are (n-1)!.

So, the total number of arrangements is the sum over all possible splits (k from 1 to 7) of [C(8,k) * (k-1)! * (8 -k -1)! ] divided by 2 because the tables are identical. Wait, no, because when we compute C(8,k) * (k-1)! * (8 -k -1)! for each k, we're considering ordered splits (i.e., assigning group k to table A and group (8-k) to table B), but since the tables are identical, each arrangement is counted twice except when k = 4. Wait, but in the earlier split count, we considered that each split is unique, so perhaps I should structure it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to consider that for each split into two groups of sizes k and 8 -k, the number of ways to seat them is (k-1)! * (7 -k)! because each group is arranged in a circle. Then, since the tables are identical, we don't need to multiply by 2 for each split, because each split is considered once.

Wait, but earlier I calculated the number of splits as 127, which includes all possible k from 1 to 7, but considering that the tables are identical, so each split is unique. So, perhaps the total number of arrangements is the sum over k=1 to 7 of [C(8,k) * (k-1)! * (8 -k -1)! ] divided by 2 when k ≠ 4, and just once when k=4. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to think about it as:

The total number of ways to seat 8 people around two identical round tables, each with at least one person, is equal to (sum from k=1 to 7 of [C(8,k) * (k-1)! * (8 -k -1)! ]) / 2.

Because for each k, the number of ways is C(8,k) * (k-1)! * (8 -k -1)! (since each group is arranged in a circle), and since the tables are identical, each split is counted twice except when k=4, but wait, no, in the sum from k=1 to 7, each split is considered once for k and once for 8-k, so we have to divide the entire sum by 2 to account for the identical tables.

So, the formula would be:

Total = [sum_{k=1}^{7} C(8,k) * (k-1)! * (8 -k -1)! ] / 2

Simplify that:

Each term is C(8,k) * (k-1)! * (7 -k)!.

But C(8,k) * (k-1)! = P(8,k) / k, where P is permutation. Wait, C(8,k) * (k-1)! = (8!)/(k! (8 -k)!)) * (k-1)! ) = 8! / (k * (8 -k)! )) Hmm, maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, let's compute each term for k from 1 to 7.

For k=1:

C(8,1) = 8

(k-1)! = 0! = 1

(8 -1 -1)! = 6! = 720

So term = 8 * 1 * 720 = 5760

k=2:

C(8,2)=28

(2-1)! =1

(8-2-1)! =5! =120

Term=28 *1 *120=3360

k=3:

C(8,3)=56

(3-1)! =2

(8-3-1)! =4! =24

Term=56 *2 *24=2688

k=4:

C(8,4)=70

(4-1)! =6

(8-4-1)! =3! =6

Term=70 *6 *6=2520

k=5:

C(8,5)=56 (same as C(8,3))

(5-1)! =24

(8-5-1)! =2! =2

Term=56 *24 *2=2688

k=6:

C(8,6)=28 (same as C(8,2))

(6-1)! =120

(8-6-1)! =1! =1

Term=28 *120 *1=3360

k=7:

C(8,7)=8 (same as C(8,1))

(7-1)! =720

(8-7-1)! =0! =1

Term=8 *720 *1=5760

Now, sum all these terms:

k=1:5760

k=2:3360 → total so far 9120

k=3:2688 → 11808

k=4:2520 → 14328

k=5:2688 →17016

k=6:3360 →20376

k=7:5760 →26136

So sum is 26136.

Now, divide this sum by 2 because the tables are identical, so each arrangement is counted twice except when k=4, but wait, no, because for each k, the term includes both k and 8-k, which are the same when considering identical tables. So, the sum includes each split twice except when k=4, which is its own mirror. So, the total number of arrangements is (sum from k=1 to 7 of terms) / 2.

So, 26136 / 2 =13068.

Wait, but let me double-check the sum. Let me add them step by step:

k=1:5760

k=2:3360 → total 9120

k=3:2688 → 11808

k=4:2520 →14328

k=5:2688 →17016

k=6:3360 →20376

k=7:5760 →26136

Yes, that's correct. Now, 26136 divided by 2 is 13068.

Looking at the options, J is 13068, so that's the answer.

The problem involves determining the number of ways to seat 8 people at 2 identical round tables, with each table having at least one person. 

1. **Splitting the Group**: Since the tables are identical, the number of ways to split the 8 people into two non-empty groups is calculated by considering all possible sizes for one group (from 1 to 7) and accounting for identical tables. This results in 127 distinct splits.

2. **Seating Arrangements**: For each split into groups of size \( k \) and \( 8 - k \), the number of ways to seat them is \( (k-1)! \times (8 - k - 1)! \). Summing these for all valid \( k \) and then dividing by 2 (to account for identical tables) gives the total number of arrangements.

3. **Calculation**: After computing the terms for each \( k \) and summing them, the total is divided by 2, resulting in 13,068 ways.
