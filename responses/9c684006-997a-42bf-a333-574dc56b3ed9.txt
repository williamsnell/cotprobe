Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about John Scott's argument regarding the 'managerial revolution'. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the question is asking what John Scott (1997) argued in the debate about the managerial revolution. The options are A to J. Let me recall what the managerial revolution is about.

From what I remember, the managerial revolution refers to the idea that in modern business, managers have gained more power and influence, sometimes at the expense of traditional owners. Some people, like Alfred Chandler, argued that there was a shift where managers, not just owners, made key decisions, leading to the rise of the managerial class.

Now, the question is about Scott's take on this. I think Scott was critical of the managerial revolution idea. He might have argued that the revolution wasn't as significant as some thought. I'm trying to remember if he said that owners still maintained control.

Looking at the options:

A: Managers planning to overthrow owners. That sounds too extreme and I don't think Scott would say that.

B: Owners control through shareholders and interlocking directorships. Maybe, but I'm not sure if Scott focused on that.

C: Ownership and management becoming separate. That's a common trend, but not sure if it's Scott's point.

D: Managerial revolution is a myth; owners still hold power. This rings a bell. I think Scott argued that the revolution wasn't real because owners still had control.

E: Managers unionizing. Unrelated, I think.

F: Scientific management principles are universal. Maybe someone else said that, like Taylor, but not Scott.

G: Management dependent on shareholders. Possible, but not Scott's main point.

H: Techniques of scientific management are inefficient. That's a critique, but again, not Scott's point on the managerial revolution.

I: Owners and managers merging roles. Doesn't seem right.

J: Owners losing control due to management autonomy. Opposite of what Scott might have said.

So, putting it together, Scott probably argued that the managerial revolution wasn't real because owners still had the majority of power. So the answer is D.

The question asks about John Scott's argument regarding the 'managerial revolution'. Scott is known for critiquing the idea that managers had gained significant power over business owners. He argued that the managerial revolution was a myth, as owners still held the majority of power in businesses. This aligns with option D.

Answer: D
