Question:

CheckMate forecasts that its dividend will grow at 20% per year for the next four years before settling down at a constant 8% forever. Dividend (current year,2016) = $12; expected rate of return = 15%. What is the fair value of the stock now?

Options:

A: 280.0
B: 305.0
C: 290.0
D: 250.0
E: 320.0
F: 273.0
G: 260.0
H: 315.0
I: 300.0
J: 265.0

Okay, so I have this question about finding the fair value of a stock using the dividend discount model. Let's see, I need to break it down step by step.

The question says that CheckMate's dividend will grow at 20% per year for the next four years and then settle to a constant 8% forever. The current dividend in 2016 is $12. The required rate of return is 15%. I need to find the fair value of the stock now.

Hmm, I remember that the dividend discount model (DDM) is used to value a stock based on the present value of its future dividends. Since the dividend growth rate changes after four years, this is a two-stage dividend discount model problem.

First, I'll calculate the dividends for each of the next four years. The current dividend is $12, and it grows at 20% per year.

Year 1 (2017): 12 * 1.20 = $14.40
Year 2 (2018): 14.40 * 1.20 = $17.28
Year 3 (2019): 17.28 * 1.20 = $20.736
Year 4 (2020): 20.736 * 1.20 = $24.8832

Wait, but after year 4, the growth rate drops to 8%. So, the dividend in year 5 will be 24.8832 * 1.08. Let me calculate that.

Year 5 dividend: 24.8832 * 1.08 = let's see, 24.8832 * 1 is 24.8832, plus 0.08*24.8832 = 1.990656. So total is 24.8832 + 1.990656 = $26.873856.

Now, from year 5 onwards, dividends grow at a constant 8%. So, the terminal value at year 4 can be calculated using the Gordon Growth Model (also part of DDM). The formula for the terminal value is D5 / (r - g), where D5 is the dividend in year 5, r is the required rate of return (15% or 0.15), and g is the constant growth rate (8% or 0.08).

So, terminal value at year 4 = 26.873856 / (0.15 - 0.08) = 26.873856 / 0.07 ≈ 383.9122286.

Now, I need to find the present value of all these future cash flows. That includes the dividends from years 1 to 4 and the present value of the terminal value.

The discount rate is 15%, so I'll calculate the present value for each cash flow.

Let me list all the cash flows:

Year 1: $14.40
Year 2: $17.28
Year 3: $20.736
Year 4: $24.8832
Terminal Value Year 4: $383.9122286

Now, calculate the present value of each:

PV of Year 1 dividend: 14.40 / (1.15)^1 = 14.40 / 1.15 ≈ 12.5217

PV of Year 2 dividend: 17.28 / (1.15)^2 = 17.28 / 1.3225 ≈ 13.0635

PV of Year 3 dividend: 20.736 / (1.15)^3 = 20.736 / 1.520875 ≈ 13.6323

PV of Year 4 dividend: 24.8832 / (1.15)^4 = 24.8832 / 1.74900625 ≈ 14.2257

PV of Terminal Value: 383.9122286 / (1.15)^4 ≈ 383.9122286 / 1.74900625 ≈ 219.4824

Now, sum all these present values to get the fair value of the stock.

Let me add them up:

12.5217 + 13.0635 = 25.5852
25.5852 + 13.6323 = 39.2175
39.2175 + 14.2257 = 53.4432
53.4432 + 219.4824 ≈ 272.9256

Wait, but the options don't have 272.93. The closest is F: 273.0. So maybe that's the answer. But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, did I calculate each PV correctly?

Year 1: 14.40 / 1.15 = 12.5217. Correct.

Year 2: 17.28 / (1.15)^2. 1.15 squared is 1.3225. 17.28 /1.3225 ≈ 13.0635. Correct.

Year3: 20.736 / (1.15)^3. 1.15^3 is approx 1.520875. 20.736 /1.520875 is about 13.6323. Correct.

Year4: 24.8832 / (1.15)^4. 1.15^4 is approximately 1.749006. 24.8832 /1.749006 ≈14.2257. Correct.

Terminal value: 383.9122286 / (1.15)^4 ≈ 383.9122 /1.749006 ≈219.4824. Correct.

Adding them: 12.5217 +13.0635=25.5852. Plus 13.6323=39.2175. Plus 14.2257=53.4432. Plus 219.4824=272.9256≈272.93.

Looking at the options, F is 273.0, which matches my calculation. So the answer should be F.

The fair value of the stock is calculated using the two-stage dividend discount model. Dividends grow at 20% for four years and then at 8% perpetually. The present value of these dividends and the terminal value is discounted at the required rate of return (15%). The sum of these present values is approximately $273.0, which corresponds to option F.

Answer: F
