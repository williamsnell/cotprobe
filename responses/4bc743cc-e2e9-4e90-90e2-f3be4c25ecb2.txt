Okay, so I've got this statistics problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding measures of central tendency and the range for a set of data. The data given are the ages of eight children: 9, 11, 8, 15, 14, 12, 17, 14.

Alright, part (a) asks for the measures of central tendency, which I remember are the mean, median, and mode. Part (b) is about finding the range of the data.

Let me start with part (a). First, I'll need to calculate the mean. The mean is the average of all the numbers. To find that, I add all the ages together and then divide by the number of children, which is 8.

So, adding them up: 9 + 11 is 20, plus 8 makes 28, plus 15 is 43, plus 14 is 57, plus 12 is 69, plus 17 is 86, and then plus the last 14 brings the total to 100. Wait, let me check that math again to be sure. 9+11=20, 20+8=28, 28+15=43, 43+14=57, 57+12=69, 69+17=86, 86+14=100. Yes, that's correct. So the total is 100. Now, divide that by 8: 100 รท 8 = 12.5. So the mean is 12.5 years.

Next, the median. The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. Since there are 8 numbers, which is even, the median will be the average of the 4th and 5th numbers. So I need to sort the data.

Let me sort the ages: 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 14, 15, 17. Now, the two middle numbers are the 4th and 5th, which are 12 and 14. The average of these two is (12 + 14) รท 2 = 26 รท 2 = 13. So the median is 13.

Now the mode. The mode is the number that appears most frequently. Looking at the sorted list: 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 14, 15, 17. The number 14 appears twice, and all others appear once. So the mode is 14.

Wait, but I see that in the options, some have mode as 12.5. Hmm, that can't be right because mode is the most frequent value, which has to be one of the actual data points. So 12.5 can't be the mode here. So the mode must be 14.

So far, mean is 12.5, median is 13, mode is 14.

Now part (b), the range. The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values. The highest age is 17, and the lowest is 8. So 17 - 8 = 9. So the range is 9.

Now let me look at the options:

Option I says: Mean:12.5, Median:13, Mode:14, Range:9. That matches exactly what I calculated.

Let me check the other options quickly to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Option E: Mean 12.5, Median 12, Mode 11, Range 10. No, median is 13, not 12.

Option F: Mean 12, Median 12.5, Mode 14, Range 9. Wait, mean is 12.5, not 12, so F is wrong.

Option C: Mean 13.5, which is higher than our 12.5, so no.

Option I is the correct one.

The mean is 12.5, median is 13, mode is 14, and range is 9. 

Answer: I

The correct answer is I.
