Okay, so I need to figure out how many people were homeless in the United States in 2016. I'm not exactly sure of the exact number, but I remember hearing some statistics about homelessness a while back. Let me think about what I know.

First, I know that homelessness is a significant issue in the US, and the numbers can vary depending on how they're counted. Some estimates are based on point-in-time counts, which are usually done on a specific night, like a census. Others might be based on shelter reports or other sources.

I think the number is in the hundreds of thousands, not millions. So looking at the options, options C, F, H are in the millions, which seems too high. I've heard that around 500,000 is a commonly cited number, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me break it down.

Option A is 55,000â€”way too low. That seems more like a small city's population. Option B is 500,000, which I've heard before. Option E is 600,000, which is a bit higher. Then D is 1.5 million and I is 1 million. J is 550,000, which is close to B but a bit higher.

I remember reading that in recent years, the number has been fluctuating but generally around 500,000 to 600,000. Wait, but I also recall that some reports might include both sheltered and unsheltered individuals. The US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) releases an annual report, the Homeless Assessment Report (HAR). Let me try to remember the numbers from around 2016.

In 2017, HUD reported that on a single night in January, there were about 553,000 people experiencing homelessness. That was a slight decrease from previous years. So in 2016, it might have been around that number or a bit lower. Looking at the options, J is 550,000, which is close to that 2017 number. So maybe in 2016, it was around 550k as well.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes the numbers are presented as a range. I think the 2016 estimate was approximately 550,000. So option J would be the correct choice.

The estimated number of homeless individuals in the United States in 2016 was approximately 550,000. This aligns closely with the HUD's Homeless Assessment Report, which reported around 553,000 people experiencing homelessness in 2017. Considering the slight decrease noted in 2017, the 2016 figure is likely close to 550,000.

Answer: J
