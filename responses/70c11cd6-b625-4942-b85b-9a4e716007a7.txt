Okay, so I've got this question about international market research and the types of equivalence. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking which of the options is NOT one of the three types of equivalence. The options are A through D: Functional, Translation, Conceptual, and Market equivalence.

I remember that equivalence in market research refers to ensuring that the same concepts are being measured across different cultures or languages. There are a few types, and I think they're often discussed in the context of survey translation and adaptation.

First, Functional equivalence. That sounds familiar. I think functional equivalence is about making sure that the questionnaire or survey functions the same way in different countries. Like, the structure and flow should be similar so that the data collected is comparable. So that's one of the correct types, so it's not the answer we're looking for.

Next, Translation equivalence. This one definitely rings a bell. Translation equivalence refers to the accuracy of the translation—making sure that the words used in one language accurately convey the same meaning in another. Without proper translation equivalence, the survey might mislead respondents, leading to inaccurate data. So this is also a correct type, not the answer.

Then there's Conceptual equivalence. I believe this is about ensuring that the concepts being measured are the same across different cultures. For example, a question about "happiness" might mean different things in different cultures, so conceptual equivalence would involve making sure that the concept is interpreted similarly by respondents. This is another correct type, so not the answer.

Now, the last option is Market equivalence. Hmm, I'm not as sure about this one. Market equivalence—does that refer to the same market structure or something? Or is it a term used elsewhere? I'm trying to recall if this is one of the standard three types. Wait, I think the three main types are usually functional, translation, and conceptual equivalence. Market equivalence doesn't sound familiar as one of the standard categories. It might be a distractor option here.

So putting it all together, the question is asking which is NOT one of the three types. Since I'm pretty sure the three are functional, translation, and conceptual, Market equivalence (option D) must be the one that's not part of the trio. Therefore, the answer should be D.

The three types of equivalence in international market research are functional, translation, and conceptual equivalence. Market equivalence is not one of these standard categories.

Answer: D
