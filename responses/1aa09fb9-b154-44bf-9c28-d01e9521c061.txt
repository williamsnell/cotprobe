Alright, let's try to figure out which number of candies Lily could have in her bag. So, the problem says she can give an equal number of pieces to 5, 3, or 2 people. That means the total number of candies must be divisible by 5, 3, and 2 without leaving any remainder. 

Hmm, okay, so I need to find a number that's a multiple of all three: 5, 3, and 2. Wait, actually, since 5, 3, and 2 are all factors, the number must be a common multiple of these three. But the smallest such number would be their least common multiple (LCM). Let me calculate that. 

The LCM of 5, 3, and 2. Well, 5 is a prime number, 3 is also prime, and 2 is prime too. So the LCM would just be the product of these numbers. 5 * 3 is 15, and 15 * 2 is 30. So the LCM is 30. That means the number of candies must be a multiple of 30. 

Looking at the options, let's see which ones are multiples of 30. 

Option A: 25. Hmm, 25 divided by 5 is 5, which is fine, but 25 divided by 3 is about 8.333, which isn't a whole number. So 25 doesn't work. 

Option B: 12. 12 divided by 2 is 6, which is okay. 12 divided by 3 is 4, that's good. But 12 divided by 5 is 2.4, which isn't a whole number. So 12 doesn't work either. 

Option C: 50. 50 divided by 2 is 25, that's fine. 50 divided by 5 is 10, which is good. But 50 divided by 3 is approximately 16.666, so that's not a whole number. So 50 is out. 

Option D: 35. 35 divided by 5 is 7, which is okay. 35 divided by 3 is about 11.666, not a whole number, so nope. 

Option E: 45. 45 divided by 5 is 9, which is fine. 45 divided by 3 is 15, that's good. But 45 divided by 2 is 22.5, which isn't a whole number. So 45 doesn't work. 

Option F: 30. Let's check. 30 divided by 2 is 15, 30 divided by 3 is 10, and 30 divided by 5 is 6. All are whole numbers. So 30 works. 

Option G: 20. 20 divided by 2 is 10, that's fine. 20 divided by 5 is 4, okay. But 20 divided by 3 is about 6.666, so nope. 

Option H: 15. 15 divided by 5 is 3, good. 15 divided by 3 is 5, that's fine. But 15 divided by 2 is 7.5, which isn't a whole number. So 15 doesn't work. 

Option I: 40. 40 divided by 2 is 20, okay. 40 divided by 5 is 8, that's good. But 40 divided by 3 is about 13.333, not a whole number. So 40 is out. 

Option J: 55. 55 divided by 5 is 11, that's fine. 55 divided by 3 is about 18.333, so nope. 

So the only number that works is option F: 30. That's the only one that's divisible by 5, 3, and 2 without any remainders.

The correct answer is F: 30.
