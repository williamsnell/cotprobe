Okay, so I need to figure out what a normative perspective is. I remember that "normative" has something to do with what should be or what's ideal. Let me think about the options given.

Option A is "The way things were." That sounds more like a descriptive perspective, talking about the past. So probably not A.

Option B is "The way things might have been." That makes me think of counterfactuals or possibilities, maybe more hypothetical than normative.

Option C is "The way things are going to be." That's about the future, so it's predictive, not necessarily about what should be.

Option D is "The way things are perceived to be." That's more about how people see things, which is subjective but not necessarily about norms or what's right.

Option E is "The way things are." That's descriptive again, just stating facts about the current state.

Option F is "The way things could have been." Similar to B, it's about possibilities or what might have happened, not necessarily what should be.

Option G is "The way things should be." This sounds exactly like what normative means. Normative perspectives deal with ideals, values, and what ought to be the case.

Option H is "The way things were thought to be." That's about beliefs or past perceptions, not necessarily about norms or ideals.

Option I is "The way things appear to be." That's descriptive, like how things seem from an observation.

Option J is "The way things could be." This is about possibilities or potential futures, similar to C and B.

So putting it all together, the normative perspective is about what should be or what's ideal, which aligns with option G.

The normative perspective is concerned with what should be or what's ideal, which is best captured by option G.

Answer: G
