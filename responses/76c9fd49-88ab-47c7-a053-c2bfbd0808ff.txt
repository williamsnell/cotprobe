Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about events happening on Earth and the Sun, and I need to find the time difference according to an observer moving at 0.8c towards the Sun and then in the opposite direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let me try to think through this.

First, the setup: Earth and Sun are 8.3 light-minutes apart. So the distance between them is 8.3 light-minutes. Events A and B happen at t=0 on Earth and t=2 minutes on the Sun, respectively. Wait, but if the Sun is moving, does that affect anything? Oh, the problem says to ignore their relative motion and assume they're in a single inertial frame. So Earth and Sun are at rest relative to each other. That simplifies things a bit.

Now, the events are A on Earth at t=0 and B on the Sun at t=2 minutes. So in the Earth-Sun frame, event A is (Earth, 0) and event B is (Sun, 2). Now, an observer moving from Earth to Sun at 0.8c. Wait, Earth to Sun is away from Earth, so for the observer moving towards the Sun, their velocity u is +0.8c in the Earth-Sun frame. Then, when the observer is moving in the opposite direction, u would be -0.8c.

I need to calculate the time difference between A and B in the observer's frame. So, I think I should use the Lorentz transformation equations. The Lorentz transformations relate the time and space coordinates between two inertial frames moving relative to each other.

The Lorentz transformation for time is given by:
t' = γ(t - (v x)/c²)
where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but in this case, the Earth and Sun are separated by a distance, so I should consider the positions of the events. Let me set up a coordinate system where Earth is at x=0 and the Sun is at x = 8.3 light-minutes. So, event A is at (x=0, t=0), and event B is at (x=8.3, t=2).

Now, the observer is moving with velocity u relative to Earth. So, from the Earth-Sun frame, the observer's speed is u. Let me first calculate γ for u=0.8c. γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64) = 1 / sqrt(0.36) = 1/0.6 ≈ 1.6667.

Wait, but in the Lorentz transformation, v is the velocity of the moving frame relative to the Earth-Sun frame. So if the observer is moving towards the Sun (same direction as the Sun from Earth), then in the Earth-Sun frame, the observer's velocity is u = +0.8c. But wait, Earth and Sun are in the same frame, so from Earth's perspective, the Sun is at rest at x=8.3 light-minutes. So the observer moving towards the Sun would have v=+0.8c in Earth's frame. Alternatively, if the observer is moving towards Earth, their velocity would be -0.8c.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this backward. Let me clarify: The Earth is at x=0, and the Sun is at x=8.3. So moving towards the Sun would be in the positive x direction, so v=+0.8c. Moving away (opposite direction) would be v=-0.8c. So for the first case, u=+0.8c, and for the second case, u=-0.8c.

Now, I need to find t'_A and t'_B in the observer's frame and then compute the time difference.

So, for event A: (x=0, t=0)
t'_A = γ (t_A - (v x_A)/c²) = γ (0 - (v*0)/c²) = 0.

For event B: (x=8.3, t=2)
t'_B = γ (t_B - (v x_B)/c²) = γ (2 - (v * 8.3)/c²).

But wait, v is in terms of c. So perhaps it's better to use v = 0.8c, so v=0.8c. Then, x_B is 8.3 light-minutes, which is in terms of distance. Let me make sure the units are consistent. Since we're dealing with light-minutes, and c is 1 light-minute per minute. So, c=1 light-minute/min.

Wait, no. Let me think: A light-minute is the distance light travels in one minute, so c is 1 light-minute per minute. So, the velocity u is 0.8 light-minutes per minute.

So, v = 0.8 light-minutes/min.

So, let's compute t'_B for both cases.

Case 1: u = +0.8c (moving towards Sun, same direction as Sun from Earth)
v = +0.8c = 0.8 light-minutes per minute.

t'_B = γ (2 - (v * 8.3)/c²)
But since c is 1 light-minute per minute, c² is (light-minutes)^2 per minute^2.

Wait, let's compute (v * x_B)/c²:
v = 0.8 light-minutes/min, x_B =8.3 light-minutes.

So, numerator is 0.8 *8.3 =6.64 (light-minutes)^2 / min.

Denominator is c² = (1 light-minute / min)^2 =1 (light-minute)^2 / min².

So, (v x_B)/c² =6.64 (light-minute)^2 / min / (1 light-minute^2 / min²) )=6.64 min.

Wait, because (min)^2 in numerator and denominator: let's see:

v * x_B = (light-min per min) * light-min) = (light-min)^2 / min.

c² = (light-min per min)^2 = (light-min)^2 / min².

So (v x_B)/c² = [ (light-min)^2 / min ] / [ (light-min)^2 / min² ] = (light-min)^2 * min² ) / (light-min)^2 * min ) )= min.

Yes, so the units are minutes. So this term is 6.64 minutes.

So t'_B = γ (2 -6.64) = γ (-4.64).

Since γ is 5/3 (approx 1.6667), then 5/3 * (-4.64) ≈ (5 * (-4.64)) /3 ≈ (-23.2)/3 ≈ -7.733 minutes.

Wait, but that would make t'_B negative. But event A is at t'_A=0, so the time difference would be t'_B - t'_A = -7.733 -0 = -7.733 minutes. But that's negative, which would mean that in the observer's frame, event B occurs before event A. But that can't be right because in Earth's frame, A is at t=0 and B is at t=2, so B is after A. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sign somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I got the direction of the velocity wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, when the observer is moving in the direction of the Sun (from Earth to Sun), their velocity is positive. But when using the Lorentz transformation, the time transformation is t' = γ (t - (v x)/c²). So if the observer is moving towards the Sun, which is in the positive x direction, then v is positive.

But in this case, event B is at x=8.3, which is positive. So (v x) is positive. So (v x)/c² is positive, so t' = γ (t - positive number). So for event B, t=2, so t' = γ (2 - 6.64) = γ (-4.64) which is negative. That would mean event B occurs before event A in the moving frame. But that's impossible because in Earth's frame, B is after A. So maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the direction of the velocity again. Let me clarify: the Earth is at x=0, Sun at x=8.3. So if the observer is moving towards the Sun, their velocity v is positive. But the time in the moving frame could be such that events are ordered differently. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the time difference as the absolute value, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the time difference as t'_B - t'_A. Since in Earth's frame, B happens after A, but in the observer's frame, if B is before A, then the time difference would be negative, but perhaps we take the absolute value. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the velocity direction. Let me try the opposite direction first.

Case 2: u = -0.8c (moving towards Earth, opposite direction)

So, v = -0.8c.

t'_B = γ (2 - (v x_B)/c²) = γ [ 2 - ( (-0.8) *8.3 ) ].

Wait, because v is negative now. So (v x_B) = (-0.8)*8.3 = -6.64.

So (v x_B)/c² = (-6.64) / (1^2) = -6.64 min.

So t'_B = γ (2 - (-6.64)) = γ (2 +6.64) = γ (8.64).

So γ is 5/3, so 5/3 *8.64 ≈ (5 *8.64)/3 ≈ 43.2/3=14.4 minutes.

So event B occurs at t'_B=14.4, and event A is at t'_A=0. So the time difference is 14.4 -0 =14.4 minutes. Looking at the options, option I is 14. Hmm, but let's check the first case again.

In case 1, when moving towards the Sun, v=+0.8c.

t'_B = γ (2 - (v x_B)/c² ) = 5/3 (2 -6.64) =5/3 (-4.64)= -7.7333.

So t'_B is negative, and event A is at 0. So the time difference is t'_B - t'_A = -7.7333 -0= -7.7333. The magnitude is 7.7333, but I don't see that option. Wait, the options include J:6, which is close but not exact. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the numbers more precisely.

Let me compute (v x_B)/c² again.

v=0.8c, x_B=8.3 light-minutes.

v x_B = 0.8 *8.3 =6.64 (light-minute)^2 per minute.

Wait, but c² is (light-minute per minute)^2, so when you divide by c², you get:

(v x_B)/c² = (0.8 *8.3) / (c²) → but since c=1 light-minute per minute, c² =1 (light-minute)^2 per minute^2.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the units wrong. Let me think again.

Actually, the units for (v x)/c²: v is in light-minutes per minute, x is in light-minutes. So v x is (light-minutes^2)/minute. c² is (light-minute)^2 per minute^2. So when you divide (v x) by c², the units become (light-minutes^2 / minute) / (light-minutes^2 / minute^2) ) = minute.

So, (v x)/c² = (0.8 *8.3) / (1) =6.64 minutes.

So, for case 1, t'_B = γ (2 -6.64) = γ (-4.64) = (5/3)*(-4.64) ≈-7.7333.

Hmm, so the time in the moving frame is negative. That would mean that event B occurs before event A in the observer's frame, which is moving towards the Sun. But in Earth's frame, B is after A. So this could be correct, but the time difference would be negative, but perhaps we take the absolute value.

Wait, but the problem asks for the time difference, so perhaps it's the absolute value. So 7.7333 minutes. But the options don't have that. The closest is J:6, but that's a bit off.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, 8.3 light-minutes multiplied by 0.8c gives 6.64 (light-minutes)^2 per minute. Wait, but perhaps I should handle the units more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate t'_A and t'_B correctly.

Wait, event A is at (x=0, t=0), so t'_A is zero.

Event B is at (x=8.3, t=2). So t'_B = γ (2 - (v *8.3)/c²).

But v is 0.8c, so (v *8.3)/c² = (0.8c *8.3)/c² = (0.8 *8.3) * c / c² = (6.64) * (1 light-minute per minute) / (c²), but since c=1 light-minute per minute, c² is 1 (light-minute)^2 per minute². So (v x)/c²=6.64 * (light-minute^2 per minute) ) / (light-minute^2 per minute²) ) =6.64 * (minute^2 / minute) )=6.64 minutes.

So, t'_B = γ (2 -6.64) = (5/3)(-4.64)= -7.7333 minutes.

So the time difference is t'_B - t'_A = -7.7333 -0 = -7.7333, so the magnitude is about 7.73 minutes. But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when the observer is moving towards the Sun, the Sun is approaching, so the time dilation and length contraction would affect the perceived time. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the proper time or something else. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the time difference using the spacetime interval.

Wait, the spacetime interval between two events is invariant. So the proper time between A and B is sqrt( (Δt)^2 - (Δx)^2 ), where Δt is 2 minutes, Δx is 8.3 light-minutes.

Wait, but wait: in Earth's frame, Δt is 2 minutes, Δx is 8.3 light-minutes. So the spacetime interval is s² = c^2 (Δt)^2 - (Δx)^2.

But c is 1 light-minute per minute, so c^2 is 1 (light-minute)^2 per minute^2.

So s² = (1)(2)^2 - (8.3)^2 =4 -68.89= -64.89 (light-minute)^2.

The proper time τ is given by sqrt( -s² / c^4 ), since s² is negative for timelike events. So τ = sqrt(64.89)/c^2. Wait, but units might complicate this. Alternatively, since s² = - (Δt')^2 + (Δx')^2 in any frame, but proper time is the maximum time measured by a clock moving with the events, but in this case, the events are on Earth and Sun, which are moving relative to the observer. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating things more than necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the time difference in the observer's frame using the Lorentz transformations correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the time for both events in the moving frame and then find the difference.

For the first case, moving towards the Sun (v=0.8c):

t'_A = γ (0 - (0.8c *0)/c^2) =0.

t'_B = γ (2 - (0.8c *8.3)/c²) = γ (2 - (0.8*8.3)/ (c^2)).

Wait, but c^2 is (light-minute)^2 per minute^2, so (0.8 *8.3) is 6.64 light-minute² per minute.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me compute (v x) / c² numerically.

v=0.8c =0.8 light-minute per minute.

x=8.3 light-minutes.

So (v x) =0.8 *8.3 =6.64 light-minute² per minute.

Divide by c², which is (light-minute per minute)^2 = (light-minute)^2 per minute².

So (v x)/c² =6.64 light-minute² / (light-minute)^2 per minute² * minute.

Wait, perhaps that's not the right way. Let me consider units properly.

(v x) has units (light-minute per minute) * light-minute = (light-minute)^2 per minute.

c² is (light-minute per minute)^2, so (light-minute)^2 per minute².

So (v x)/c² has units (light-minute)^2 per minute divided by (light-minute)^2 per minute²) = minute.

So, (v x)/c² =6.64 / (c^2) → but since c=1 light-minute per minute, c^2=1, so it's 6.64 minutes.

So t'_B = γ (2 -6.64) = γ (-4.64) = (5/3)(-4.64)= -7.7333 minutes.

So, the time difference is -7.7333 minutes, but since time difference can't be negative, perhaps the magnitude is 7.7333, which is about 7.73 minutes. But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the velocity. Let me think again: when the observer is moving towards the Sun (from Earth), their velocity is positive. But the time in their frame could be such that event B occurs before event A. But in Earth's frame, B occurs after A, but in the moving frame, due to relativity, it's possible for the events to be in a different order.

But the problem asks for the time difference. So in the first case, moving towards the Sun, the time difference would be |t'_B - t'_A|=7.7333 minutes. But none of the options match. The closest is J:6, but that's a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate more accurately.

Let me compute (2 -6.64) = -4.64.

Multiply by γ=5/3: (5/3)*(-4.64)= -23.2/3 ≈-7.7333.

So, 7.7333 minutes. But the options don't have that. Hmm. Let me check the second case again.

Case 2: moving opposite to the Sun (towards Earth), v=-0.8c.

So, t'_B = γ (2 - (v x_B)/c²) = γ [2 - (-0.8 *8.3)] = γ (2 +6.64) = γ (8.64).

γ=5/3, so 5/3 *8.64= (5 *8.64)/3 =43.2/3=14.4 minutes.

So the time difference here is 14.4 -0=14.4 minutes, which is option I:14.

So, for moving towards the Sun, the time difference is approximately 7.73 minutes, but the options don't have that. However, in the opposite direction, it's 14.4, which is option I:14. So perhaps the first case is 14.4, but that's not matching the options. Wait, but the options for the first part are 18,22,16, etc. Wait, let me check the problem again.

Wait, the problem says to find the time difference when moving towards the Sun (u=0.8c from Earth to Sun) and then in the opposite direction. So the first part is moving towards the Sun, and the second part is moving away.

Wait, but in the first case, the time difference is negative, but perhaps the question expects the magnitude, so 7.7333, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, maybe I should consider the time it takes for light to reach the observer when considering the events. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relativistic velocity addition or consider the simultaneity.

Wait, another approach: in the Earth frame, event A is at (0,0), event B is at (8.3,2). The observer is moving at v=0.8c. The events as seen by the observer would have their own coordinates.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the time difference as (t'_B - t'_A) in the moving frame.

Wait, in the first case (v=+0.8c), t'_B = γ (2 - (0.8 *8.3)/1) = γ (2 -6.64)= γ (-4.64)= (5/3)(-4.64)= -7.7333.

So the time difference is -7.7333 minutes. But since time can't be negative, perhaps the observer sees B happening before A, so the time difference would be 7.7333 minutes, but the options don't include that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me recheck.

Wait, the problem states that events A and B occur at t=0 on Earth and t=2 minutes on the Sun respectively. So in Earth's frame, A is at Earth at t=0, and B is at Sun at t=2.

But the Sun is at x=8.3 light-minutes. So in Earth's frame, the time for light to reach the Sun is 8.3 minutes, so if event B occurs at t=2 on the Sun, how does that align with Earth's frame? Because in Earth's frame, the Sun is 8.3 light-minutes away, so any event on the Sun would have light take 8.3 minutes to reach Earth. So if event B occurs at t=2 on the Sun, in Earth's frame, the light from B would arrive at t=2 +8.3=10.3 minutes. But event A is at t=0 on Earth. So in Earth's frame, A occurs at t=0, and B's light arrives at t=10.3. But the problem says events occur at t=0 and t=2, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that both events are simultaneous in Earth's frame, but no, the problem states that A is at t=0 on Earth and B is at t=2 on the Sun. So in Earth's frame, A is at Earth at t=0, and B is at Sun at t=2. So from Earth's perspective, B happens 2 minutes after A, but because the Sun is 8.3 light-minutes away, the light from B would reach Earth at t=2 +8.3=10.3 minutes. But the problem seems to ignore this and treats the events as happening at their respective times in Earth's frame, not considering the travel time of light. So perhaps I should proceed with the Lorentz transformations as I did earlier.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider the fact that the observer moving towards the Sun would see the Sun approaching, so the distance between Earth and Sun would be length-contracted. Hmm, but that might complicate things further.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the time it takes for the observer to reach the Sun and whether they can observe both events. But that might not be necessary.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this using the concept of simultaneity. The time when events are simultaneous in Earth's frame may not be simultaneous in the moving frame.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the time difference in the moving frame using the formula Δt' = γ (Δt - (v Δx)/c²).

Wait, yes! Because the time difference between events in the Earth frame is Δt =2 minutes, and Δx=8.3 light-minutes.

So, using the formula:

Δt' = γ (Δt - (v Δx)/c² )

So for the first case, when v=0.8c towards the Sun:

Δt' = γ (2 - (0.8 *8.3)/1) = γ (2 -6.64)= γ (-4.64)= (5/3)(-4.64)= -7.7333 minutes.

So the time difference is -7.7333 minutes, which implies that event B occurs before event A in the moving frame. But the problem is asking for the time difference, so perhaps the magnitude is 7.7333, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the time difference as the absolute value, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the fact that the observer's clock is moving, so when they are moving towards the Sun, the time between the events would be less than in Earth's frame. But in this case, the Earth frame has Δt=2 minutes, and the moving frame has Δt' = γ(Δt - (v Δx)/c² ). So for v=0.8c, that's (5/3)(2 -6.64)= (5/3)(-4.64)= -7.7333. So the time difference is negative, meaning B happens before A.

In the opposite direction, v=-0.8c:

Δt' = γ (2 - (-0.8 *8.3)/1 )= γ (2 +6.64)= γ (8.64)= (5/3)(8.64)=14.4 minutes.

So, the time difference is 14.4 minutes, which is option I:14.

But for the first case, I'm not getting an option. However, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the numbers:

v=0.8c, Δx=8.3, so (v Δx)/c²=0.8*8.3=6.64.

Δt'= γ (2 -6.64)= γ (-4.64)=5/3*(-4.64)= -7.7333.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer for the first part is 14.4, which is option I, and the second part is 7.7333, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the velocity direction.

Wait, perhaps when moving towards the Sun, the time difference is shorter, and when moving away, it's longer. So in the first case, the time difference is 14.4, and the second case is about 7.73. But the options don't have 7.73; the closest is J:6, but that's not close enough.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the reciprocal. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign of the velocity.

Wait, perhaps when moving towards the Sun, the time difference is γ (Δt + (v Δx)/c² ), but that would be for v in the opposite direction.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Δt' = γ (Δt - (v Δx)/c² ), regardless of direction.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to summarize:

Case 1: moving towards Sun (v=+0.8c):

Δt' = (5/3)(2 -6.64)= -7.7333 → time difference is 7.7333 minutes (since B occurs before A).

But the options don't have this, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Case 2: moving opposite (v=-0.8c):

Δt' = (5/3)(2 +6.64)=14.4 → option I.

So, for the first part, the time difference would be 7.7333, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in setup.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the time it takes for the observer to reach the events. For example, if the observer is moving towards the Sun, perhaps they cannot observe event B until after they arrive, but that would complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the events are observed in sequence, so the time difference would be the proper time.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the time it takes for the observer to reach the events and then calculate the time difference accordingly.

Wait, perhaps the observer is moving, so the time they experience is different. But I think I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that the first case gives a time difference of 7.7333, which isn't an option, so perhaps the correct answer is 14.4 minutes for the opposite direction, which is option I:14.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the time difference between two events, A and B, as observed from a frame moving at \( u = 0.8c \) relative to the Earth-Sun frame. The Earth and Sun are 8.3 light-minutes apart, with event A occurring at \( t = 0 \) on Earth and event B occurring at \( t = 2 \) minutes on the Sun. The Lorentz transformation is used to determine the time difference in the moving frame.

### Key Steps:
1. **Lorentz Factor (\( \gamma \))**:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.8)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.36}} = \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.6667
   \]

2. **Time Transformation**:  
   The time difference in the moving frame is given by:  
   \[
   \Delta t' = \gamma \left( \Delta t - \frac{v \Delta x}{c^2} \right)
   \]  
   where \( \Delta t = 2 \, \text{minutes} \), \( \Delta x = 8.3 \, \text{light-minutes} \), and \( v = 0.8c \).

3. **Case 1: Moving Towards the Sun (\( v = +0.8c \))**:  
   Substituting values:  
   \[
   \Delta t' = \frac{5}{3} \left( 2 - \frac{0.8 \cdot 8.3}{1} \right) = \frac{5}{3} (2 - 6.64) = \frac{5}{3} (-4.64) \approx -7.7333 \, \text{minutes}
   \]  
   The negative sign indicates that event B occurs before event A in this frame. The magnitude of the time difference is approximately \( 7.7333 \, \text{minutes} \), but this value is not among the provided options.

4. **Case 2: Moving Opposite to the Sun (\( v = -0.8c \))**:  
   Substituting values:  
   \[
   \Delta t' = \frac{5}{3} \left( 2 - \frac{(-0.8) \cdot 8.3}{1} \right) = \frac{5}{3} (2 + 6.64) = \frac{5}{3} (8.64) \approx 14.4 \, \text{minutes}
   \]  
   This matches option **I: 14**.

### Conclusion:
- For the first case (moving towards the Sun), the calculated time difference does not match any provided option.
- For the second case (moving opposite to the Sun), the time difference is \( 14.4 \, \text{minutes} \), which corresponds to **I: 14**.

**Answer: I**
