Okay, so I've got this question about peroxisomal disorders, and I need to figure out which condition among the options is a peroxisomal disorder. Let me start by recalling what peroxisomes do. From what I remember, peroxisomes are cellular organelles involved in breaking down certain substances, like fatty acids, especially the longer ones. They also play a role in detoxifying some compounds and helping with the production of bile acids.

The question gives me a list of options from A to J. I'll go through each one and think about whether it's related to peroxisomes or not.

Option A: Zellweger syndrome. I think this is a peroxisomal disorder. I've heard it's also called cerebrotendinosus muscular dystrophy or something like that. It affects the peroxisomes, leading to problems with bile acid synthesis and other metabolic issues. So I'm pretty sure A is correct.

Option B: Maple syrup urine disease. I remember this is a metabolic disorder, but I think it's related to the mitochondria. It's a type of amino acid metabolism disorder where the body can't break down certain amino acids, leading to a build-up that causes symptoms. So B is probably not a peroxisomal disorder.

Option C: Hemophilia. That's a blood clotting disorder, right? It's related to factors in the blood, so I don't think it's peroxisomal. It's more of a genetic disorder affecting the coagulation factors.

Option D: Medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. Hmm, this sounds like a fatty acid oxidation disorder. Medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase is an enzyme involved in breaking down fatty acids in the mitochondria. So this is a mitochondrial disorder, not peroxisomal. So D is out.

Option E: Huntington's disease. That's a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a genetic mutation leading to the production of an abnormal protein. It's not related to organelles like peroxisomes or mitochondria; it's more of a general cellular issue. So E is not it.

Option F: Tay-Sachs disease. I think this is a lysosomal storage disorder. Tay-Sachs causes a buildup of a specific lipid in the lysosomes, leading to neurological problems. So F isn't a peroxisomal disorder.

Option G: Acute intermittent porphyria. This is a disorder of porphyrin metabolism, which is related to heme synthesis. I believe it's linked to the mitochondria because heme is produced there. So G is not peroxisomal.

Option H: Phenylketonuria. That's a disorder where the body can't break down phenylalanine, leading to a buildup that can cause brain damage. It's a metabolic disorder, but I think it's primarily a liver issue, not related to peroxisomes. So H is not the answer.

Option I: Sickle cell disease. This is a blood disorder where red blood cells become misshapen, causing various health issues. It's a genetic disorder affecting hemoglobin, so it's unrelated to peroxisomes. I is not correct.

Option J: Cystic Fibrosis. This is a genetic disorder affecting the production of mucus, sweat, and digestive enzymes. It's caused by a defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. I don't think it's related to peroxisomal dysfunction, so J is out.

So, going back, the only one that fits is option A: Zellweger syndrome. It's a peroxisomal disorder because it involves issues with peroxisomal function, leading to various metabolic problems.

The correct answer is A: Zellweger syndrome, as it is a peroxisomal disorder affecting the proper functioning of peroxisomes.

Answer: A
