Okay, I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about faulty analogies. The question is asking about what happens when an analogy is faulty. So, I remember that analogies are comparisons between two things to highlight similarities. But a faulty analogy would be one that's not effective, probably because the similarities aren't relevant or the differences are too significant.

Looking at the options:

A: Completely unrelated in any way. Hmm, that might be too strong. If they're completely unrelated, the analogy wouldn't make sense at all. But I think faulty analogies usually have some similarities but maybe not the right ones.

B: Similar in some ways, different in others. Wait, that sounds like a normal analogy. The question is about a faulty one, so maybe this isn't the right answer because it's just a standard analogy.

C: Similar in appearance, but not in function. That could be a faulty analogy because the appearance is similar, but the function is different, which might not make the point clear.

D: Sufficiently similar. That sounds like a good analogy, not a faulty one. So probably not the answer.

E: Not sufficiently similar in relevant ways. This makes sense. If the analogy isn't similar enough in the right aspects, it's faulty. For example, comparing apples to oranges when they're both fruits but not similar in the point being made.

F: Different in appearance, but similar in function. I'm not sure. If they look different but function similarly, maybe that's a good analogy depending on the context. But I'm not sure if it's a faulty one.

G: Completely identical in all ways. That's probably not a faulty analogy because if they're identical, the comparison is too trivial.

H: Completely dissimilar in all ways. That's similar to option A. If they're completely different, the analogy wouldn't work, but I think faulty analogies have some similarities but not the right ones.

I: Complete opposites. Like night and day. That might be too extreme; maybe not the best fit.

Wait, the question is about what the things being compared are in a faulty analogy. So, a faulty analogy is when the things are similar in some ways but not in others, but the differences are more important than the similarities, making the analogy misleading or irrelevant.

So, E says "Not sufficiently similar in relevant ways." That seems to fit because if the analogy isn't similar enough in the aspects that matter, it's a bad comparison. For example, using a car analogy to explain something about birds when the point is about speed, but cars and birds are both fast, but maybe the other aspects don't support the point.

Alternatively, B says they're similar in some ways, different in others. But that's true of all analogies, but a faulty one is when the similarity isn't enough in the relevant aspects. So E is better because it's about not being sufficiently similar in the right ways.

The correct answer is E: Not sufficiently similar in relevant ways.

Answer: E
