Okay, so I've got this question about electrical analogies, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is asking for the electrical analogous quantity for a spring element (K) in the force-voltage analogy. The options are from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I remember that electrical analogies often compare mechanical systems to electrical circuits. There are different types, like the force-voltage and current-mechanical analogies. Since the question is about the force-voltage analogy, I'll focus on that.

In mechanical systems, a spring has a stiffness, which is denoted by K. When a force is applied, the spring extends or compresses proportionally, following Hooke's Law: F = Kx. So K is the spring constant.

Now, in the electrical force-voltage analogy, each mechanical element is mapped to an electrical one. The force in mechanics is analogous to voltage (or electromotive force) in electricity. So, the spring, which resists force and causes displacement, should be analogous to something that resists voltage and causes current.

Wait, no, I think I might have that mixed up. Let me think again. In the force-voltage analogy, force is like voltage, and velocity is like current. So, mechanical systems are modeled using voltage and current sources in the electrical circuit.

The spring in mechanics stores potential energy when deformed. In electrical terms, capacitors store electrical energy when a voltage is applied. So, a spring would be analogous to a capacitor. Because a capacitor resists changes in voltage, just like a spring resists changes in force, causing displacement.

But wait, the question is about the analogous quantity for K, the spring constant. So, what's the analogous parameter in the electrical system? For a spring, K is stiffness, which relates force to displacement (F = Kx). In the electrical analogy, force is voltage, and displacement would be analogous to current because current is the rate of charge flow, which is like the rate of mass flow in mechanical systems.

If I'm mapping F = Kx to V = something * I, then K would correspond to something in the electrical circuit. Let me think about the equations. For a capacitor, the voltage across it is related to the current through it by the integral form, V = (1/C) * ∫I dt. But in terms of analogous behavior, the spring's K is like the reciprocal of capacitance? Wait, no, maybe I'm getting it wrong.

Alternatively, in the analogy, the spring's stiffness K would be analogous to the conductance G in electrical terms. Because conductance (G) is current per unit voltage (I = G*V), similar to how K is force per unit displacement (F = K*x). But conductance is the reciprocal of resistance (G=1/R), so maybe K corresponds to 1/R or R?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to structure this better.

Force-voltage analogy mapping:

- Force (F) → Voltage (V)
- Velocity (v) → Current (I)
- Mass (m) → Inductance (L) because inductors resist changes in current, similar to mass resisting changes in velocity.
- Spring stiffness (K) → Capacitance (C) because capacitors resist changes in voltage, similar to springs resisting changes in force.

So, the spring K is analogous to capacitance C. But the question asks for the electrical analogous quantity for K, not for the whole element. So, K is like C. So the answer would be C, which is option C. But wait, let me double-check.

Wait, in the analogy, the mechanical system's equation F = Kx becomes V = (1/C) * I, because I = C*(dV/dt). So, rearranged, V = (1/C) ∫I dt. But in terms of the analogous parameter, K is like 1/C? Or is it C?

Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the direct analogs. Let me think in terms of analogous variables. In the force-voltage analogy, the mechanical system's equation is F + Kx = 0, which would correspond to V + something * I = 0. Since F is voltage V, and x is displacement, which corresponds to charge Q (since current is rate of charge). So, Kx would be K * x = something involving Q. But x is like displacement, which is analogous to charge. Wait, because in the analogy, displacement x is like charge Q because F is like V, and F is work done per unit charge (V=W/Q). Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, velocity is like current, so integrating velocity over time gives displacement, which is like charge (since current I = dQ/dt).

So, F = Kx → V = K * x → V = K * (something). Since x is analogous to charge Q, then V = K Q. But in electrical terms, voltage V across a capacitor is Q/C. So, V = Q/C → Q = C V. Comparing to V = K Q → V = K (C V) → 1 = K C → K = 1/C. So, K is like 1/C. Therefore, the analogous quantity would be 1/C.

Wait, that changes things. So, K in mechanics is like 1/C in electronics. So the answer would be B: 1/C.

But I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Earlier I thought K was like C, but now I'm getting K like 1/C. Let me try to clarify.

In the force-voltage analogy, each element is mapped as follows:

- Force F ↔ Voltage V
- Velocity v ↔ Current I
- Displacement x ↔ Charge Q (since I = dQ/dt and v = dx/dt)
- Mass m ↔ Inductance L (since F = ma → V = L di/dt)
- Spring K ↔ Capacitance C (since F = -Kx → V = - (1/C) Q)

Wait, that makes more sense. So, F = -Kx becomes V = - (1/C) Q. So, K is 1/C? Or is it C?

Wait, solving for K: F = -Kx → V = -(K x). But x is displacement, which is like charge Q. So V = -(K Q). But in electronics, V across a capacitor is Q/C → V = (1/C) Q. So, comparing, K Q = (1/C) Q → K = 1/C. So, K is analogous to 1/C.

Therefore, the electrical analogous quantity for K is 1/C, which is option B.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me check another approach. The mechanical system's equation for a spring is F = Kx. In the analogy, F is voltage V, x is charge Q (because displacement x is analogous to charge Q, since velocity v is current I). So, V = K Q. But in electronics, the voltage across a capacitor is V = Q/C. So, K Q = Q/C → K = 1/C. Therefore, K is analogous to 1/C.

So the answer should be B: 1/C.
</think>

The electrical analogous quantity for a spring element (K) in the force-voltage analogy is **1/C**, where C represents capacitance. This is because the mechanical equation \( F = Kx \) corresponds to the electrical equation \( V = \frac{Q}{C} \), leading to \( K = \frac{1}{C} \).

Answer: B
