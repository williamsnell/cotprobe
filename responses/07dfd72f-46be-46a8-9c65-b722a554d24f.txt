Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the sun converting hydrogen into helium, and I need to find out how much hydrogen is converted per second. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem gives me the masses of a _1H^1 atom (which is just a proton) and a _2He^4 atom. The masses are 1.00813 amu and 4.00386 amu, respectively. Wait, but when hydrogen fuses into helium, it's actually four protons combining to form one helium-4 nucleus, right? Because each helium-4 atom has two protons and two neutrons, but the fusion process typically involves four hydrogen nuclei fusing into one helium, two neutrons, and some energy. But maybe I can ignore the neutrons here since the question is about the amount of hydrogen used.

So, the mass of four _1H^1 atoms would be 4 times 1.00813 amu. Let me calculate that: 4 * 1.00813 equals approximately 4.03252 amu. Now, the mass of one _2He^4 atom is 4.00386 amu. So the difference in mass between the reactants (hydrogen) and the product (helium) is 4.03252 - 4.00386 = 0.02866 amu. This mass difference is converted into energy, which is then radiated by the sun, and this energy reaches the Earth as the solar constant.

The solar constant is given as 1.35 kW·m². Wait, but the Earth is 1.5 × 10^8 km away from the sun. Oh right, because the sun emits energy in all directions, the Earth only intercepts a small portion of that energy, which forms a sphere with radius equal to the Earth's distance from the sun. So the power received by the Earth is the total power output of the sun multiplied by the area of a sphere with radius R.

Let me think: the solar constant S is equal to the power output of the sun divided by the surface area of the sphere at Earth's distance. So, the sun's power L (luminosity) is S multiplied by 4πR². Since S is given as 1.35 kW/m², and R is 1.5e8 km, I need to convert R into meters. Oh right, 1 km is 1e3 meters, so R is 1.5e8 * 1e3 = 1.5e11 meters.

So, L = S * 4πR². Let me compute that. First, S is 1.35 kW/m², which is 1350 W/m². Let me make sure the units are correct. Yes, 1 kW is 1000 W, so 1.35 kW is 1350 W.

Now, R is 1.5e11 meters. So R squared is (1.5e11)^2 = 2.25e22 m². Multiply by 4π: 4 * π is approximately 12.566. So 12.566 * 2.25e22 ≈ 2.827e23 m². Then multiply by S (1350 W/m²): 2.827e23 * 1350 ≈ 3.816e26 W. So the sun's luminosity L is about 3.816e26 watts.

Wait, but wait a minute. I think I might have made a mistake because sometimes the luminosity is given as about 3.8e26 W, so this seems correct.

Now, the energy from the sun comes from the mass conversion in the fusion process. Each four hydrogen atoms are converted into one helium atom, releasing energy equal to the mass difference times c². So the energy released per four hydrogen atoms is Δm * c², where Δm is 0.02866 amu.

First, I need to convert Δm from amu to kilograms. 1 amu is 1.660539e-27 kg. So Δm = 0.02866 amu * 1.660539e-27 kg/amu ≈ 4.765e-29 kg.

The energy per four hydrogen atoms is then E = Δm * c². The speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So c squared is 9e16 m²/s².

So E = 4.765e-29 kg * 9e16 m²/s² ≈ 4.2885e-12 joules per four hydrogen atoms. Or, per one hydrogen atom, it's 4.2885e-12 J /4 ≈ 1.072e-12 J per H atom.

But wait, actually, since four H atoms are converted into one He, the energy per four H atoms is 4.2885e-12 J.

Now, the total energy the sun emits per second is L = 3.816e26 J/s (since 1 watt is 1 J/s). So, the number of four-H-atom groups being fused per second is the total energy per second divided by the energy per group.

Number of groups per second = L / E_per_group = 3.816e26 J/s / 4.2885e-12 J/group ≈ 8.906e37 groups/s.

Each group corresponds to four H atoms, so the number of H atoms converted per second is 4 * 8.906e37 ≈ 3.562e38 atoms/s.

Now, to find the mass of H converted per second, we multiply the number of atoms by the mass per atom. Mass per H atom is 1.00813 amu, which is 1.00813 * 1.660539e-27 kg ≈ 1.674e-27 kg.

So mass per second is 3.562e38 atoms/s * 1.674e-27 kg/atom ≈ 5.95e11 kg/s.

Wait, that's about 5.95e11 kg per second. Looking at the options, I see option C is 5.99e11 kg, which is very close. But let me double-check my calculations for any possible errors.

Wait, let me recheck the steps:

1. Solar constant S = 1.35 kW/m² = 1350 W/m².

2. Earth's distance R = 1.5e8 km = 1.5e11 m.

3. Sun's luminosity L = S * 4πR².

   R² = (1.5e11)^2 = 2.25e22 m².

   4πR² ≈ 4 * 3.1416 * 2.25e22 ≈ 2.827e23 m².

   L = 1350 W/m² * 2.827e23 m² = 3.816e26 W.

4. Mass difference per group: 4*(1.00813) - 4.00386 = 4.03252 -4.00386 = 0.02866 amu.

5. Δm = 0.02866 amu * 1.660539e-27 kg/amu ≈ 4.765e-29 kg.

6. Energy per group E = Δm * c² ≈ 4.765e-29 kg * (9e16 m²/s²) = 4.288e-12 J.

7. Number of groups per second: L / E = 3.816e26 J/s / 4.288e-12 J/group ≈ 8.906e37 groups/s.

8. Number of H atoms per second: 4 * 8.906e37 ≈ 3.562e38 atoms/s.

9. Mass per H atom: 1.00813 amu = 1.00813 * 1.660539e-27 kg ≈ 1.674e-27 kg.

10. Mass per second: 3.562e38 atoms/s * 1.674e-27 kg/atom ≈ 5.95e11 kg/s.

Hmm, but option C is 5.99e11 kg, which is a bit higher. Did I make a calculation mistake?

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the amu to kg conversion. Let me recalculate Δm.

Δm in amu is 0.02866 amu. 1 amu = 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So Δm = 0.02866 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg ≈ 0.02866 * 1.660539e-27.

Let's compute 0.02866 * 1.660539e-27:

0.02866 * 1.660539 = approximately 0.02866 * 1.66 ≈ 0.04765. So 0.04765e-27 kg = 4.765e-29 kg. That's correct.

Then E = 4.765e-29 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 = 4.765e-29 *9e16 = 4.2885e-12 J per group.

L is 3.816e26 J/s.

Number of groups per second: 3.816e26 / 4.2885e-12 ≈ 8.906e37.

Wait, 3.816e26 divided by 4.2885e-12 is equal to (3.816 /4.2885) ) * 1e38.

3.816 /4.2885 ≈ 0.8906.

So 0.8906e38 = 8.906e37 groups/s.

Then H atoms per second: 4 * 8.906e37 = 3.5624e38 atoms/s.

Mass per second: 3.5624e38 * 1.00813 amu * 1.660539e-27 kg/amu.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it as:

Each H atom is 1.00813 amu, so 1.00813 * 1.660539e-27 kg ≈ 1.00813 * 1.660539 = approx 1.674e-27 kg.

So mass per H atom is 1.674e-27 kg.

So 3.5624e38 atoms/s * 1.674e-27 kg/atom = ?

3.5624e38 * 1.674e-27 = (3.5624 * 1.674) * 1e11.

3.5624 * 1.674 ≈ let's compute that:

3 * 1.674 = 5.022

0.5624 *1.674 ≈ 0.5624 *1.6=0.9, 0.5624 *0.074≈0.0417 → total ≈0.9417

So total ≈5.022 + 0.9417 =5.9637.

So 5.9637e11 kg/s.

Which is approximately 5.96e11 kg/s. Looking at the options, option C is 5.99e11 kg, which is close. But perhaps I need to be more precise in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should carry more decimal places in the earlier steps.

Let me recompute 4 * 1.00813 = 4.03252 amu.

Then 4.03252 -4.00386 =0.02866 amu. Correct.

Then 0.02866 * 1.660539e-27 kg = let's compute it accurately.

0.02866 * 1.660539e-27 = ?

0.02866 *1.660539 = 0.0476588.

So 0.0476588e-27 kg = 4.76588e-29 kg.

Then E = 4.76588e-29 kg * (3e8)^2 = 4.76588e-29 *9e16 = 4.289292e-12 J per group.

L = 3.816e26 J/s.

Number of groups per second: 3.816e26 /4.289292e-12 = ?

3.816e26 /4.289292e-12 = (3.816 /4.289292) ) *1e38.

3.816 /4.289292 ≈ 0.8906.

So 0.8906e38 =8.906e37 groups/s.

Each group is 4 H atoms, so 4 *8.906e37 =3.5624e38 atoms/s.

Mass per H atom:1.00813 *1.660539e-27 kg.

Compute 1.00813 *1.660539:

1 *1.660539=1.660539

0.00813 *1.660539 ≈0.01351.

Total ≈1.660539 +0.01351≈1.67405e-27 kg per H atom.

So mass per second:3.5624e38 *1.67405e-27 =3.5624 *1.67405e11.

Compute 3.5624 *1.67405.

3 *1.67405 =5.02215

0.5624 *1.67405:

0.5 *1.67405=0.837025

0.0624 *1.67405≈0.1043

So total ≈0.837025 +0.1043=0.941325

Adding 5.02215 +0.941325=5.963475.

So 5.963475e11 kg/s, which is approximately 5.963e11 kg/s.

Looking at the options, option C is 5.99e11 kg, which is very close. But perhaps I made a miscalculation in the luminosity.

Wait, let me recheck the luminosity calculation. The solar constant S is 1.35 kW/m², which is 1350 W/m². Earth's distance R is 1.5e8 km =1.5e11 m.

So the area is 4π R² =4 * π * (1.5e11)^2.

Compute (1.5e11)^2 =2.25e22. 4π *2.25e22 = approx 28.2743e22 =2.82743e23 m².

Then L = S *4π R² =1350 W/m² *2.82743e23 m² =1350 *2.82743e23.

1350 *2.82743e23 = (1.35e3) * (2.82743e23) )=1.35 *2.82743e26 =3.816e26 W. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the answer is 5.96e11, which is close to 5.99e11 (option C). Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the energy per four H atoms is 0.02866 amu, which is 0.02866 *931.5 MeV/c² per amu, but wait, that's another way to compute the energy, using the conversion factor of 931.5 MeV/amu. But that's probably overcomplicating it; I think my initial approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the total mass converted includes the two neutrons released, but wait, the problem asks for the hydrogen converted, so maybe those neutrons are not part of the hydrogen mass. So I think the initial approach is correct.

Wait, but in the calculation, I found 5.96e11 kg/s. The closest option is C:5.99e11. But perhaps I made a mistake in the number of groups per second. Let me check that.

Wait, another approach: the energy per second (luminosity) is 3.816e26 J/s. Each four H atoms release E = 4.2885e-12 J. So the number of four-H groups is 3.816e26 /4.2885e-12 = 8.906e37 groups/s.

Each group has four H atoms, so 4 *8.906e37 =3.5624e38 atoms/s.

Each H atom is 1.00813 amu → 1.00813 *1.660539e-27 kg =1.674e-27 kg.

So mass per second is 3.5624e38 *1.674e-27 =≈5.963e11 kg/s.

Looking at the options, the closest is C:5.99e11. But I'm getting 5.96e11, so perhaps the correct answer is option C. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.5624e38 *1.674e-27 kg exactly.

3.5624e38 *1.674e-27 =3.5624 *1.674 *1e11.

3.5624 *1.674: Let me compute this accurately.

3.5624 *1.674:

Breakdown:

3 *1.674 =5.022

0.5 *1.674 =0.837 → 5.022 +0.837=5.859

0.0624 *1.674= approx 0.1043 → 5.859 +0.1043=5.9633.

So 5.9633e11 kg/s.

Which is approximately 5.96e11 kg/s. The options are:

C:5.99e11

H:6.22e11

F:5.01e11

So 5.96 is closest to C, but perhaps my calculation is a bit off. Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a slightly different value for the amu to kg conversion or for the solar luminosity.

Wait, another thing: when you convert four H into He, each He-4 has mass 4.00386 amu, but each H is 1.00813 amu. So 4 H atoms have mass 4*1.00813=4.03252 amu. The He is 4.00386 amu. So the mass loss is 4.03252 -4.00386=0.02866 amu. Correct.

But perhaps when you have four H atoms fusing into one He nucleus and two electrons (if considering electron capture), but maybe that's not relevant here. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the actual mass difference is per mole or something else. Hmm, but the problem is about atoms, so I think it's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that each He nucleus (alpha particle) is formed from four H nuclei (protons), but in reality, two neutrons are also involved. So the initial mass would include the four protons plus the two neutrons? No, because the problem states that hydrogen is being converted to helium, so I think it's just the four H atoms contributing.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy released is per He nucleus, which is considering four H atoms and two neutrons, but I think the problem is simplifying it to four H atoms fusing into one He, releasing energy from the mass difference.

So I think my approach is correct. Therefore, the answer should be approximately 5.96e11 kg/s, which is closest to option C:5.99e11 kg/s. But looking at the options, option I is 5.89e11, which is also close. Wait, option I is 5.89e11. Maybe I made a miscalculation in the mass per H atom.

Let me recalculate the mass per H atom more precisely.

1.00813 amu * 1.66053906660e-27 kg/amu = ?

1.00813 *1.66053906660e-27.

Let me compute this:

1.00813 *1.66053906660 = ?

Compute 1 *1.66053906660 =1.66053906660

0.00813 *1.66053906660 ≈ 0.00813 *1.660539 ≈ 0.01351.

So total is approximately 1.660539 +0.01351 =1.674049e-27 kg.

So each H atom is 1.674049e-27 kg.

So the mass per second is 3.5624e38 *1.674049e-27 =3.5624 *1.674049e11.

3.5624 *1.674049 ≈5.963e11 kg/s.

So I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the closest option is C:5.99e11.

Wait, but option C is 5.99e11, which is very close to 5.963e11, so perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should double-check the luminosity. Let me think: the sun's luminosity is indeed about 3.828e26 W, so that part is correct.

Hmm, considering all that, I think the correct answer is option C:5.99 ×10^11 kg.
</think>

To determine how much hydrogen is converted to helium in the sun per second, we start by calculating the mass difference between four hydrogen atoms and one helium-4 atom. The mass of a single hydrogen atom is 1.00813 amu, so four hydrogen atoms have a combined mass of:

\[
4 \times 1.00813 = 4.03252 \, \text{amu}.
\]

The mass of a helium-4 atom is 4.00386 amu. The mass difference is:

\[
4.03252 - 4.00386 = 0.02866 \, \text{amu}.
\]

Converting this mass difference to kilograms using \(1 \, \text{amu} = 1.660539 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\):

\[
\Delta m = 0.02866 \times 1.660539 \times 10^{-27} = 4.765 \times 10^{-29} \, \text{kg}.
\]

The energy released per group of four hydrogen atoms is calculated using \(E = \Delta m \cdot c^2\), where \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\):

\[
E = 4.765 \times 10^{-29} \cdot (3 \times 10^8)^2 = 4.2885 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{J}.
\]

The sun's luminosity \(L\) is derived from the solar constant \(S = 1.35 \, \text{kW/m}^2 = 1350 \, \text{W/m}^2\) and the Earth's distance \(R = 1.5 \times 10^8 \, \text{km} = 1.5 \times 10^{11} \, \text{m}\). The luminosity is:

\[
L = S \cdot 4\pi R^2 = 1350 \cdot 4\pi \cdot (1.5 \times 10^{11})^2 = 3.816 \times 10^{26} \, \text{W}.
\]

The number of four-hydrogen-atom groups converted per second is:

\[
\text{Number of groups} = \frac{L}{E} = \frac{3.816 \times 10^{26}}{4.2885 \times 10^{-12}} = 8.906 \times 10^{37} \, \text{groups/s}.
\]

Each group corresponds to four hydrogen atoms, so the number of hydrogen atoms converted per second is:

\[
\text{Number of H atoms} = 4 \cdot 8.906 \times 10^{37} = 3.562 \times 10^{38} \, \text{atoms/s}.
\]

The mass of hydrogen converted per second is calculated by multiplying the number of hydrogen atoms by the mass of each hydrogen atom (\(1.00813 \, \text{amu} = 1.674 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\)):

\[
\text{Mass of H converted} = 3.562 \times 10^{38} \cdot 1.674 \times 10^{-27} = 5.96 \times 10^{11} \, \text{kg/s}.
\]

The closest option to this result is **C: \(5.99 \times 10^{11} \, \text{kg}\)**.

**Answer: C**
