Okay, so I need to balance the half-reaction where bromate ions (BrO3^-) form bromine (Br2) in an acid solution. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that balancing redox reactions involves splitting the reaction into oxidation and reduction half-reactions. In this case, bromate is turning into bromine, so I should figure out if it's oxidation or reduction. 

Bromine in bromate has an oxidation state. Let me calculate that. In BrO3^-, oxygen is -2 each. So for Br: Br + 3*(-2) = -1. That means Br = +5. In Br2, bromine is 0. So going from +5 to 0 is a reduction because it's gaining electrons. Wait, no, wait. Reduction is gain of electrons, which would mean a decrease in oxidation state. Wait, bromine is going from +5 to 0, which is a decrease. So yes, reduction. 

So the half-reaction is a reduction half-reaction. Now, I need to balance the atoms and then the charges.

Step 1: Write the skeleton reaction. BrO3^- → Br2.

Step 2: Balance Br atoms. On the left, there's one Br per BrO3^- ion. On the right, there are 2 Br atoms. To balance, I'll add a coefficient of 2 on the left. Wait, that would make 2 BrO3^- → Br2. Now, Br is balanced (2 on each side).

Wait, but actually, let me write it correctly. Let me write:

BrO3^- → Br2

But to balance Br, I need 2 BrO3^- → Br2. So 2 BrO3^- → Br2.

Now, balance O. On the left, there are 2 * 3 = 6 O atoms. Since it's in acid solution, I can add H2O to balance O. So I'll add H2O on the right because O is on the left. Wait, no, wait. If I have O on the left, I can add H2O to the right to balance O. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The left has 6 O from 2 BrO3^-; the right has none. So I can add H2O to the right. Let me add 6 H2O to the right to balance O. So now the equation is:

2 BrO3^- → Br2 + 6 H2O

Next, balance H. On the right, 6 H2O gives 12 H. Since it's in acid solution, I can add H+ to the left. So I'll add 12 H+ to the left.

Now the equation is:

12 H+ + 2 BrO3^- → Br2 + 6 H2O

Now, balance the charges. Let me compute the charge on each side.

Left side: 12 H+ is +12, and 2 BrO3^- is 2*(-1) = -2. Total charge: +12 -2 = +10.

Right side: Br2 is neutral, 6 H2O is neutral. So total charge is 0.

So the left side is +10, right is 0. To balance the charge, we add electrons. Since it's a reduction, electrons should be on the left (as they are gained). So we need to add electrons to the left to make the charges equal.

The difference in charge is +10 on the left and 0 on the right. So to balance, we need to subtract 10 charge from the left. Since each electron has a charge of -1, adding 10 electrons to the left would make the left side charge +10 -10 = 0, matching the right. 

Wait, no. Wait, the left is +10, right is 0. So the left is higher. To make them equal, we need to add 10 electrons to the left. Because adding electrons (each -1) would decrease the left's charge by 10. So 12 H+ (12) + 2 BrO3^- (-2) → total +10. If we add 10 electrons (each -1) to the left, the total charge becomes +10 -10 = 0. So the equation becomes:

10 e^- + 12 H+ + 2 BrO3^- → Br2 + 6 H2O

Now, check the charges again. Left: 10*(-1) +12*(+1) +2*(-1)= -10 +12 -2 = 0. Right: 0. So charges are balanced.

Now, check the atoms:

Br: 2 on left (2 BrO3^-), 2 on right (Br2). O: 6 on left (2 BrO3^- *3 O each), 6 on right (6 H2O). H: 12 on left (12 H+), 12 on right (6 H2O *2 H each). Electrons are balanced too.

So the balanced half-reaction is:

10 e^- + 12 H+ + 2 BrO3^- → Br2 + 6 H2O

Now, the question is about the number of electrons on each side. The question says, "The balanced half-reaction has..." and the options are about the number of electrons on left or right.

In the balanced equation, there are 10 electrons on the left. So looking at the options:

Looking at the options, option D says 10 electrons on the left. So the correct answer would be D.

Wait, let me double-check. The reaction as written has 10 e^- on the left. So yes, D is correct.

The balanced half-reaction for bromate ions (BrO₃⁻) forming bromine (Br₂) in an acid solution is:

10 e⁻ + 12 H⁺ + 2 BrO₃⁻ → Br₂ + 6 H₂O

In this reaction, there are 10 electrons on the left side. 

Answer: D
