Okay, so I need to figure out what astrological sign someone would have if they were born on Halloween. Let me think about this step by step. 

First, I remember that Halloween is October 31st. Now, I need to recall the dates for each zodiac sign. I know that the zodiac signs are based on the constellations that the sun passes through during the year. Each sign covers a specific date range.

Starting from January, let's go through the signs:

- Aries is from March 21 to April 19.
- Taurus is April 20 to May 20.
- Gemini is May 21 to June 20.
- Cancer is June 21 to July 22.
- Leo is July 23 to August 22.
- Virgo is August 23 to September 22.
- Libra is September 23 to October 22.
- Scorpio is October 23 to November 21.
- Sagittarius is November 22 to December 21.
- Capricorn is December 22 to January 19.
- Aquarius is January 20 to February 18.
- Pisces is February 19 to March 20.

Wait, so looking at Libra and Scorpio. Libra ends on October 22, and Scorpio starts on October 23. Since Halloween is October 31, that falls under Scorpio. So the correct sign should be Scorpio.

Looking back at the options, B is Scorpio. So the answer should be B.

The correct astrological sign for someone born on Halloween (October 31) is Scorpio, which corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
