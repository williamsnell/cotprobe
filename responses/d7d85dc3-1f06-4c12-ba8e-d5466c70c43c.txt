Okay, so I have this question about Hamming distances, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by understanding what Hamming distance is. From what I remember, the Hamming distance between two strings of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different. So, basically, it's how many bits you have to flip to get from one string to another.

The question gives me four codewords: 000000, 010101, 101010, and 110110. I need to calculate the Hamming pairwise distances between each pair and find the minimum distance among all of them.

First, I should list all possible pairs. Since there are four codewords, the number of unique pairs is 4 choose 2, which is 6 pairs. Those pairs are:

1. 000000 vs 010101
2. 000000 vs 101010
3. 000000 vs 110110
4. 010101 vs 101010
5. 010101 vs 110110
6. 101010 vs 110110

Now, I'll go through each pair and calculate their Hamming distances.

Starting with pair 1: 000000 and 010101.

I'll compare each corresponding bit:

0 vs 0 → same → no difference
0 vs 1 → different → count 1
0 vs 0 → same
0 vs 1 → different → count 2
0 vs 0 → same
0 vs 1 → different → count 3

So the Hamming distance here is 3.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me recount. Let's line them up:

000000
010101

Compare each position:

1: 0 vs 0 → same
2: 0 vs 1 → different → 1
3: 0 vs 0 → same
4: 0 vs 1 → different → 2
5: 0 vs 0 → same
6: 0 vs 1 → different → 3

Yes, so the distance is 3. Hmm, but I'm not sure if I'm counting correctly. Let me do it another way: for each position, if the bits are different, add 1.

Positions 1: same (0)
Positions 2: different (1)
Positions 3: same (0)
Positions 4: different (1)
Positions 5: same (0)
Positions 6: different (1)
Total: 3 differences. So Hamming distance is 3.

Wait, but looking again, the first codeword is 000000 and the second is 010101. Let me write them:

0 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 0 1

Comparing each bit:

1. 0 vs 0 → 0
2. 0 vs 1 → 1
3. 0 vs 0 → 0
4. 0 vs 1 → 1
5. 0 vs 0 → 0
6. 0 vs 1 → 1

So total 3 differences. So Hamming distance is 3.

Moving on to pair 2: 000000 vs 101010.

Let's compare each bit:

0 vs 1 → 1
0 vs 0 → 0
0 vs 1 → 1
0 vs 0 → 0
0 vs 1 → 1
0 vs 0 → 0

So the differences are at positions 1,3,5. That's three differences again. Hamming distance is 3.

Wait, no, let me count again:

000000
101010

Position 1: 0 vs 1 → diff (1)
Position 2: 0 vs 0 → same (0)
Position 3: 0 vs 1 → diff (2)
Position 4: 0 vs 0 → same (0)
Position 5: 0 vs 1 → diff (3)
Position 6: 0 vs 0 → same (0)
Total: 3 differences. So Hamming distance is 3.

Pair 3: 000000 vs 110110.

Compare each bit:

0 vs 1 → 1
0 vs 1 → 2
0 vs 0 → 0
0 vs 1 → 3
0 vs 1 → 4
0 vs 0 → 0

Wait, let me do this step by step:

000000
110110

Position 1: 0 vs 1 → diff (1)
Position 2: 0 vs 1 → diff (2)
Position 3: 0 vs 0 → same
Position 4: 0 vs 1 → diff (3)
Position 5: 0 vs 1 → diff (4)
Position 6: 0 vs 0 → same

So total of 4 differences. Hamming distance is 4.

Okay, now pair 4: 010101 vs 101010.

Let's compare each bit:

0 vs 1 → diff (1)
1 vs 0 → diff (2)
0 vs 1 → diff (3)
1 vs 0 → diff (4)
0 vs 1 → diff (5)
1 vs 0 → diff (6)

Wait, that can't be right because all bits are different. Let me see:

010101
101010

Each position:

1: 0 vs 1 → diff (1)
2: 1 vs 0 → diff (2)
3: 0 vs 1 → diff (3)
4: 1 vs 0 → diff (4)
5: 0 vs 1 → diff (5)
6: 1 vs 0 → diff (6)

So all six positions are different. Hamming distance is 6.

Hmm, that's a high distance. So that's 6.

Pair 5: 010101 vs 110110.

Let me compare each bit:

0 vs 1 → diff (1)
1 vs 1 → same (0)
0 vs 0 → same (0)
1 vs 1 → same (0)
0 vs 1 → diff (2)
1 vs 0 → diff (3)

So let's list them:

010101
110110

Position 1: 0 vs 1 → diff (1)
Position 2: 1 vs 1 → same
Position 3: 0 vs 0 → same
Position 4: 1 vs 1 → same
Position 5: 0 vs 1 → diff (2)
Position 6: 1 vs 0 → diff (3)

Total of 3 differences. Hamming distance is 3.

Wait, no. Let me count again:

Positions 1: 0 vs 1 → 1
Position 2: 1 vs 1 → 0
Position3:0 vs0→0
Position4:1 vs1→0
Position5:0 vs1→1
Position6:1 vs0→1
So total 3 differences. So Hamming distance is 3.

Pair 6: 101010 vs 110110.

Compare each bit:

1 vs 1 → same (0)
0 vs 1 → diff (1)
1 vs 0 → diff (2)
0 vs 1 → diff (3)
1 vs 1 → same (0)
0 vs 0 → same (0)

So, differences at positions 2,3,4 → 3 differences. Hamming distance is 3.

Wait, let me check:

101010
110110

Positions:

1: 1 vs 1 → 0
2: 0 vs 1 → 1
3: 1 vs 0 → 1 (total 2)
4: 0 vs 1 → 1 (total 3)
5: 1 vs1 →0
6:0 vs0→0

Yes, 3 differences.

So now, I have all the Hamming distances:

Pair 1: 3
Pair 2: 3
Pair 3:4
Pair4:6
Pair5:3
Pair6:3

So the distances are 3,3,4,6,3,3.

Wait, no, let me list them again with the pairs:

1. 000000 & 010101 → 3
2. 000000 & 101010 →3
3. 000000 & 110110 →4
4. 010101 &101010 →6
5.010101 &110110 →3
6.101010 &110110 →3

So the minimum among these is 3, but wait, wait I think I made a mistake. Because when I looked at pair 3, 000000 vs 110110, I thought it was 4 differences. Let me double-check that.

000000 vs 110110:

0 vs1 → diff (1)
0 vs1 → diff (2)
0 vs0 → same
0 vs1 → diff (3)
0 vs1 → diff (4)
0 vs0 → same

Wait, no, that's 4 differences? Let me count again:

Positions:

1: 0 vs1 →1
2:0 vs1 →2
3:0 vs0 → same
4:0 vs1 →3
5:0 vs1 →4
6:0 vs0 → same

So yes, 4 differences. So Hamming distance is 4.

Wait, but what about the other pairs? Did I miss any pair with a smaller distance?

Looking back, the pairs have distances of 3,3,4,6,3,3. So the minimum is 3, but wait, is there any pair with a distance less than 3?

Wait, let me check pair 5 again: 010101 vs 110110.

Wait, the codewords are 010101 and 110110.

Let me compare each bit again:

0 vs1 →1
1 vs1 →0
0 vs0 →0
1 vs1 →0
0 vs1 →1
1 vs0 →1

So differences at positions 1,5,6 → 3 differences. So Hamming distance is 3.

So all the distances are 3,3,4,6,3,3.

So the minimum Hamming distance among all pairs is 3. Wait, but wait a second. Looking back at the codewords, could there be any pair with a distance of 0? Because if two codewords are the same, their distance is 0. But in the given codewords, all are distinct. So the minimum possible is 3.

But wait, looking again at the options, option H is 3. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me check another possibility. Are there any pairs I miscalculated?

Wait, let's check pair 5 again: 010101 vs 110110.

Wait, 010101 is 0 1 0 1 0 1.

110110 is 1 1 0 1 1 0.

Comparing each bit:

1. 0 vs1 →1
2.1 vs1 →0
3.0 vs0 →0
4.1 vs1 →0
5.0 vs1 →1
6.1 vs0 →1

So differences at positions 1,5,6 → 3. So yes, 3.

Wait, but I remember that when I first started, I thought the minimum was 3, but looking at the options, I see option A is 1, which is lower than 3. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, maybe I should check if any pair has a distance of 1. Let me look again.

Looking back at the pairs:

Is there any pair where only one bit differs?

Looking at the codewords:

000000, 010101,101010,110110.

Wait, 010101 is 010101, 101010 is 101010. Let me compare them again.

010101 vs 101010:

0 vs1 →1
1 vs0 →1
0 vs1 →1
1 vs0 →1
0 vs1 →1
1 vs0 →1

Wait, that's 6 differences. So Hamming distance is 6, which I had before.

Wait, but maybe another pair. Let me check 000000 vs 010101: 3 differences.

What about 010101 vs 101010: 6 differences.

Wait, maybe I should check if any pair has a distance of 1.

Wait, looking at the codewords:

000000: 000000
010101: 010101
101010:101010
110110:110110

Wait, perhaps 010101 and 101010 have a distance of 6, which I calculated earlier.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me think: the Hamming distance is the number of differing bits. So if any two codewords have only one differing bit, their distance would be 1. But looking at the codewords, I don't see any two that differ by only one bit.

Wait, for example, is 000000 and 000001 a pair? No, they aren't given. The given pairs are the four codewords as listed.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the Hamming distance for pair 5 or 6.

Wait, let's check pair 5: 010101 vs 110110.

010101 → 0 1 0 1 0 1

110110 →1 1 0 1 1 0

Comparing each position:

1: 0 vs1 →1
2:1 vs1 →0
3:0 vs0 →0
4:1 vs1 →0
5:0 vs1 →1
6:1 vs0 →1

So total of 3 differences. So Hamming distance is 3.

Wait, but what about pair 6: 101010 vs 110110.

101010 →1 0 1 0 1 0

110110 →1 1 0 1 1 0

Compare each position:

1:1 vs1 →0
2:0 vs1 →1
3:1 vs0 →1
4:0 vs1 →1
5:1 vs1 →0
6:0 vs0 →0

So differences at positions 2,3,4 → 3. So Hamming distance is 3.

So all the calculated distances are 3,3,4,6,3,3. So the minimum is 3.

But wait, the options include A:1, which would be the minimum possible. So why isn't the minimum 1?

Because none of the pairs have a distance of 1. All the pairs have at least 3 differences. So the minimum Hamming distance among the given codewords is 3.

Wait, but looking back, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me check one of the pairs again.

Wait, let's take 000000 and 010101.

000000 is all zeros, and 010101 is 010101. Comparing each bit:

Positions where they differ are 2,4,6 → 3 differences. So Hamming distance is 3.

Similarly, 000000 vs 101010 → differences at 2,4,6 → 3.

Wait, but 101010 is 1 0 1 0 1 0, so 000000 (all zeros) vs 101010 → positions 1,3,5 are 1s, others 0. So differences at positions 1,3,5 → 3 differences.

So yes, Hamming distance is 3.

So the minimum Hamming distance is 3. Looking at the options, option H is 3.

Wait, but the options are:

A:1
B:8
C:9
D:2
E:5
F:4
G:6
H:3
I:7
J:0

So the correct answer is H:3.

To determine the minimum Hamming distance among the given codewords, we calculate the pairwise Hamming distances for all unique pairs:

1. **000000 vs 010101**: Differences at positions 2, 4, 6 → **3**.
2. **000000 vs 101010**: Differences at positions 1, 3, 5 → **3**.
3. **000000 vs 110110**: Differences at positions 1, 2, 4, 5 → **4**.
4. **010101 vs 101010**: All positions differ → **6**.
5. **010101 vs 110110**: Differences at positions 1, 5, 6 → **3**.
6. **101010 vs 110110**: Differences at positions 2, 3, 4 → **3**.

The Hamming distances are **3, 3, 4, 6, 3, 3**. The minimum Hamming distance is **3**.

**Answer: H**
