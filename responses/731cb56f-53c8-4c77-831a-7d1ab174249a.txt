Okay, so I need to solve the quadratic equation x² -7x -10 = 0. Hmm, I remember there are a couple of ways to solve quadratic equations. One is factoring, another is using the quadratic formula, and maybe completing the square. Let me think which method would be easiest here.

First, I'll try factoring because it's usually quicker if the equation factors nicely. The equation is x² -7x -10. To factor it, I need two numbers that multiply to -10 and add up to -7. Wait, let me think about the factors of 10. The factors are 1 and 10, 2 and 5. Since the product is negative, one of the numbers must be positive and the other negative.

Let me see: If I take 5 and 2, their product is 10, but I need -10. So maybe -5 and +2? Let's check: -5 * 2 = -10, and -5 + 2 = -3. That's not -7. Hmm, not right. How about -10 and +1? That would give me -10 * 1 = -10, and -10 +1 = -9. Still not -7. Wait, maybe I need to switch the signs? Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the signs. The equation is x² -7x -10, so the middle term is -7x, and the constant term is -10. So when factoring, I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to -10 and add to -7. Let me list the possible pairs:

-10 and +1: -10 +1 = -9 → no.
-5 and +2: -5 +2 = -3 → no.
+5 and -2: 5 -2 = 3 → no.
+10 and -1: 10 -1 =9 → no.

Hmm, none of these add up to -7. So maybe this equation doesn't factor nicely. That would mean I have to use the quadratic formula instead. 

The quadratic formula is x = [ -b ± sqrt(b² -4ac) ] / (2a). In this equation, a=1, b=-7, c=-10. Plugging these into the formula:

Discriminant D = b² -4ac = (-7)² -4*(1)*(-10) = 49 +40 = 89. Wait, 49 +40 is 89? Let me check: 49 +40 is indeed 89. So sqrt(89) is approximately 9.433, but I'll keep it exact for now.

So x = [7 ± sqrt(89)] / 2. That's the exact solution, but looking at the options, I don't see any square roots. All options are pairs of integers. So maybe I made a mistake in factoring earlier. Let me try another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options given to see if any of them satisfy the equation. The options are pairs, so they must be the roots.

Let me take each option and plug them into the equation to see if they make it zero.

Option A: 3 and 4.

Let's test x=3: 3² -7*3 -10 = 9-21-10= -22 ≠0. So A is incorrect.

Option B:1,3. Test x=1: 1 -7 -10= -16≠0. So B is out.

Option C:4,6. Test x=4: 16-28-10= -22≠0. So C is wrong.

Option D:6,1. Test x=6: 36-42-10= -16≠0. No.

Option E:-5, -2. Test x=-5: 25 +35 -10=50≠0. No.

Option F:-2,5. Test x=-2: 4 +14 -10=8≠0. No. Test x=5:25-35-10=-20≠0. So F is wrong.

Option G:7,9. Test x=7:49-49-10= -10≠0. So no.

Option H:5,2. Test x=5:25-35-10=-20≠0. Test x=2:4-14-10=-20≠0. So H is incorrect.

Option I:0,7. Test x=0:0-0-10=-10≠0. Test x=7:49-49-10=-10≠0. So I is wrong.

Wait, none of the options when plugged in give zero. That can't be right. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in testing the options. Let me check option E again. E is -5 and -2.

Testing x=-5: (-5)^2 =25; -7*(-5)=35; so 25 +35 -10= 50. That's correct, but it's not zero. So no.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the factoring. Perhaps I missed a pair. Let me think again. The equation is x² -7x -10. Let's see, perhaps the factors are (x-10)(x+1), but that would be x² -9x -10, which isn't our equation. Or (x-5)(x+2)=x²-3x-10, which also doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the factors are (x-5)(x+2) = x² -3x -10. No, that's not the same as our equation. So perhaps the equation doesn't factor with integers. Therefore, the roots must be irrational or maybe complex, but since the options are all integers, none of them are correct. But that can't be the case because the question must have an answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic formula. Let me recalculate D: b²= (-7)^2=49. 4ac=4*1*(-10)= -40. So D=49 - (-40)=49+40=89. That's correct. So the roots are (7±√89)/2, which are not integers. But the options are all integer pairs. So perhaps the question is incorrect, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe I misread the equation.

Wait, the equation is x² -7x -10=0. Maybe I should check if I wrote it correctly. Yes, that's what's given. So perhaps I should consider that the options are incorrect, but the correct answer is not listed. But the options are given, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should try completing the square. Let's see:

x² -7x =10.

To complete the square, take half of -7, which is -3.5, square it: 12.25.

Add 12.25 to both sides: x² -7x +12.25 =10 +12.25 → (x - 3.5)^2 =22.25.

Take square roots: x -3.5= ±√22.25 → √22.25 is 4.75, but that's not an integer either.

Hmm, this is confusing. Since none of the options work, but the correct roots are non-integers, perhaps the answer is E: -5 and -2, but wait, when I tested x=-5, it didn't work. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let me test x=5 and x=2 again. For x=5: 25 -35 -10= -20≠0. For x=2:4-14-10=-20≠0. So H is wrong.

Wait, maybe I should check if the equation was written correctly. The user wrote x² -7x -10=0. Alternatively, perhaps it's x² +7x -10=0, but that's not what's given.

Wait, perhaps the options are correct, but I'm miscalculating. Let me try option E again: -5 and -2.

If the roots are -5 and -2, then the equation would be (x +5)(x +2) = x² +7x +10. But our equation is x² -7x -10, which is different. So E can't be correct.

Wait, maybe the equation is x² +7x -10=0. Let me check that. Then the factors would be (x +10)(x -1)=x² +9x -10, which is not matching. Alternatively, (x+5)(x-2)=x²+3x-10, which is not our equation.

I'm getting stuck here. Since none of the options work, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use the quadratic formula again to find the exact roots and see if any of the options match, but they are all integers, so probably not. Alternatively, maybe the equation was miswritten.

Wait, perhaps the equation is x² -7x +10=0. Let me check that. Then the factors would be (x-5)(x-2)=x²-7x+10=0, which would make the roots 5 and 2, which is option H. But the original equation is x² -7x -10=0, so that's different. So perhaps the user made a mistake, but assuming the equation is correct, I'm stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the equation is x² +7x -10=0, which would have roots (-7 ±√(49 +40))/2 = (-7 ±√89)/2, which are still not integers.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the equation is x² -7x -10=0, and the options are wrong. But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I should look for a different approach. Let me try the quadratic formula again:

x = [7 ± √(49 +40)] / 2 = [7 ± √89]/2. √89 is approximately 9.433, so the roots are approximately (7+9.433)/2 ≈16.433/2≈8.216 and (7-9.433)/2≈-2.433/2≈-1.216. These are not integers, so none of the options are correct. But the options are given, so perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the equation is x² -7x +10=0, which would have roots 5 and 2, option H. But that's a different equation. Alternatively, maybe the equation is x² +7x -10=0, which would have roots as above. Alternatively, perhaps I should check the options again.

Wait, I think I see a mistake. Let me check option E again: -5 and -2. If I plug x=-5 into the equation: (-5)^2 -7*(-5) -10 =25 +35 -10=50≠0. So no. Similarly, x=-2:4 +14 -10=8≠0.

Wait, perhaps the equation is x² +7x -10=0. Let me factor that. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -10 and add to +7. That would be 10 and -1: 10*-1=-10, 10-1=9, not 7. 5 and -2: 5*(-2)=-10, 5-2=3, not 7. So that equation doesn't factor either.

I'm stuck. The correct roots are not integers, so none of the options are correct. But the problem must have an answer, so perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the equation is x² -7x -10=0, and the options are wrong. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe I should look for a typo in the equation.

Wait, perhaps the equation is x² -7x +10=0, which would factor into (x-5)(x-2)=0, giving roots 5 and 2, which is option H. But the original equation has a minus 10, not plus. So unless there's a typo, the answer isn't among the options.

But since the options are given, perhaps I should choose the closest possible. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should use the quadratic formula again to confirm:

x = [7 ± √(49 +40)] /2 → [7 ±√89]/2. √89 is about 9.433. So the roots are (7 +9.433)/2 ≈16.433/2≈8.2165 and (7-9.433)/2≈-2.433/2≈-1.2165. These are not integers, so no options match.

Wait, perhaps the equation is x² -7x +10=0. Let me check that. Then the roots are 5 and 2, option H. But that's a different equation.

Alternatively, maybe the equation is x² -7x +10=0, which would have roots 5 and 2, option H. But the original equation is x² -7x -10=0, so that's not the case.

I'm really stuck here. I think the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the equation was meant to be x² -7x +10=0, which would have roots 5 and 2, option H.

But given the options, I think the intended answer is E: -5, -2, but that doesn't satisfy the equation. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H:5,2, but that's for a different equation.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. Let me list them:

A:3,4 → sum 7, product 12 → equation x² -7x +12=0.

B:1,3 → sum 4, product 3 → x² -4x +3=0.

C:4,6 → sum 10, product 24 → x² -10x +24=0.

D:6,1 → same as D: sum7, product6→x² -7x +6=0.

E:-5,-2 → sum -7, product 10 →x² +7x +10=0.

F:-2,5 → sum3, product-10 →x²-3x-10=0.

G:7,9→sum16, product63→x²-16x+63=0.

H:5,2→sum7, product10→x²-7x+10=0.

I:0,7→sum7, product0→x²-7x=0.

Our equation is x² -7x -10=0. So the sum is 7, product is -10. Looking at the options, which pair has sum 7 and product -10? Let's see:

Option F: -2 and5 → sum 3, product -10. Not 7.

Option H:5,2→ sum7, product10. Not -10.

Wait, so none of the options have sum7 and product -10. Therefore, the correct roots aren't among the options. But the problem must have an answer, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the equation is x² -7x +10=0, which has roots 5 and2, option H. But that's a different equation. Alternatively, maybe the equation is x² +7x -10=0, which would have roots (-7 ±√89)/2, which are not integers.

I think the intended answer is E: -5, -2, but that's for the equation x² +7x +10=0. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but the closest option is F: -2,5, which has product -10 but sum 3, not 7.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the equation is x² -7x -10=0, and the correct roots are (7 ±√89)/2, which are approximately 8.216 and -1.216. None of the options match these.

But the options are given, so perhaps the intended answer is E: -5, -2, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the equation was meant to be x² -7x +10=0, which would have roots 5 and2, option H.

Given that, perhaps the intended answer is H:5,2, assuming a typo in the equation. So I'll go with H.
</think>

The equation \( x^2 - 7x - 10 = 0 \) is given. To solve it, factoring was attempted, but the equation does not factor neatly with integers. Using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \) with \( a = 1 \), \( b = -7 \), and \( c = -10 \), the discriminant was calculated as \( 89 \), leading to irrational roots. Testing the provided options revealed that none of the integer pairs satisfy the equation. However, considering a possible typo in the equation, if it were \( x^2 - 7x + 10 = 0 \), the roots would be \( 5 \) and \( 2 \), corresponding to option H.

Answer: H
