Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a thin lens changing its focal length when it's immersed in water. Hmm, I remember that the focal length of a lens depends on the refractive index of the surrounding medium. Let me think about how that works.

The problem says the lens has a focal length of 10 inches in air, and the refractive index of the lens material is 1.53. Now, it's being put into water, which has a refractive index of 1.33. I need to find the new focal length in water.

Wait, I recall something about the lensmaker's formula. Oh right, the formula is 1/f = (n_lens - 1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2), but when the lens is in a medium, the effective refractive index becomes (n_lens/n_medium - 1). Or was it (n_lens - n_medium)/n_medium? Hmm, maybe I should double-check.

Alternatively, I think the formula for focal length when the lens is in a medium is f_medium = f_air * (n_medium) / (n_lens - n_medium + 1). Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing it up. Let me think again.

Oh wait, the general formula for focal length in a medium is f_medium = f_air * (n_medium) / (n_lens - 1). No, that doesn't sound right. Or maybe it's f_medium = f_air * (n_medium) / (n_lens - n_medium + 1). Wait, maybe another approach.

I remember that when a lens is placed in a medium, its focal length changes because the effective refractive index relative to the medium changes. The formula for the focal length in the new medium is f' = f * (n_medium) / (n_lens - n_medium). Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think.

The correct formula I think is f' = f * (n_medium) / (n_lens - n_medium + 1). Or maybe it's f' = f * (n_medium) / (n_lens - n_medium). Wait, perhaps I should look up the lensmaker's formula for a medium.

Wait, the lensmaker's formula in a medium is: 1/f = (n_lens/n_medium - 1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2). So compared to air, where n_medium is 1, the focal length changes based on the ratio of the refractive indices.

So, in air, n_medium is 1, so 1/f_air = (n_lens -1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2). When immersed in water, n_medium is 1.33, so 1/f_water = (n_lens / n_water - 1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2).

But since (1/R1 - 1/R2) is the same for both situations, we can set up a ratio. Let me call (1/R1 - 1/R2) as k for simplicity.

So in air: 1/f_air = (n_lens -1) * k.

In water: 1/f_water = (n_lens / n_water - 1) * k.

Dividing the two equations: (1/f_water) / (1/f_air) = [ (n_lens / n_water -1) ] / [ (n_lens -1) ]

So f_water = f_air * [ (n_lens -1) ] / [ (n_lens / n_water - 1) ]

Wait, let me compute that. Let's plug in the numbers.

n_lens = 1.53, n_water = 1.33.

So (n_lens - 1) = 0.53.

(n_lens / n_water) = 1.53 / 1.33 ≈ 1.1503759.

Then (n_lens / n_water - 1) = 1.1503759 - 1 = 0.1503759.

So f_water = 10 inches * (0.53) / (0.1503759) ≈ 10 * (0.53 / 0.1503759).

Calculating 0.53 divided by approximately 0.150376.

0.53 / 0.150376 ≈ 3.524.

So f_water ≈ 10 * 3.524 ≈ 35.24 inches. Looking at the options, H is 35.2 inches, which is close.

Wait, but wait a second. Another way I've heard it is that the focal length in the new medium is f' = f * (n_medium) / (n_lens - n_medium). Let me try that.

n_medium is 1.33, n_lens is 1.53. So denominator is 1.53 - 1.33 = 0.2.

So f' = 10 * (1.33) / 0.2 = 10 * 6.65 = 66.5. That's not in the options, so maybe that approach is wrong.

Hmm, perhaps I did the ratio correctly the first time. Let me go back.

So, using the first method, I get approximately 35.2 inches, which is option H. That's one of the choices. Alternatively, maybe I made a calculation error.

Wait, let me re-calculate the division step.

0.53 divided by 0.1503759.

Let me compute 0.53 ÷ 0.1503759.

0.1503759 * 3 = 0.4511277.

0.4511277 is less than 0.53, so 3 times that. The difference is 0.53 - 0.4511277 = 0.0788723.

Now, 0.1503759 * 0.524 ≈ 0.078782 (since 0.15 * 0.524 ≈ 0.0786). So total is 3.524.

So 10 inches * 3.524 ≈ 35.24 inches. So option H is 35.2 inches, which matches this.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is f_water = f_air * (n_water)/(n_lens - 1). Let me try that.

n_water is 1.33, n_lens -1 is 0.53.

So f_water = 10 * (1.33/0.53) ≈ 10 * 2.509 ≈ 25.09 inches. That's close to option F (25.2). But that's a different result.

Hmm, now I'm confused because I'm getting two different answers depending on which formula I use. Which one is correct?

Wait, maybe I should look up the correct formula. Oh wait, I can't, but I can reason it out.

The lensmaker's formula in a medium is 1/f = (n_lens/n_medium - 1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2). So when the medium changes, the effective refractive index is (n_lens/n_medium -1). So the focal length in the new medium is f' = f_air * (n_medium)/(n_lens - n_medium).

Wait, no, because in air, 1/f_air = (n_lens -1) * k.

In water, 1/f_water = (n_lens/n_water - 1) * k.

So, 1/f_water = [(n_lens - n_water)/n_water ] * k.

But since 1/f_air = (n_lens - 1) * k, then k = 1/(f_air (n_lens - 1)).

Substituting into f_water:

1/f_water = [(n_lens - n_water)/n_water ] * [1/(f_air (n_lens -1))]

So,

f_water = f_air * [n_water (n_lens -1) ] / (n_lens - n_water )

So, plugging in the numbers:

n_water = 1.33, n_lens = 1.53.

n_lens -1 = 0.53.

n_lens - n_water = 1.53 -1.33 = 0.2.

So,

f_water = 10 * [1.33 * 0.53 ] / 0.2.

Calculate numerator: 1.33 * 0.53 ≈ 0.7049.

Then, 0.7049 / 0.2 = 3.5245.

So f_water ≈ 10 * 3.5245 ≈ 35.245 inches. Which is approximately 35.2 inches, option H.

So the correct answer should be H.

The focal length of a lens changes when immersed in a medium due to the alteration in the effective refractive index. Using the lensmaker's formula, the focal length in water can be calculated as:

\[
f_{\text{water}} = f_{\text{air}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{water}}}{n_{\text{lens}} - n_{\text{water}}}
\]

Given the focal length in air \( f_{\text{air}} = 10 \, \text{inches} \), the refractive index of the lens \( n_{\text{lens}} = 1.53 \), and the refractive index of water \( n_{\text{water}} = 1.33 \), we calculate:

\[
f_{\text{water}} = 10 \cdot \frac{1.33}{1.53 - 1.33} = 10 \cdot \frac{1.33}{0.2} = 66.5 \, \text{inches}
\]

However, this result does not match the provided options. Revisiting the formula and recalculating carefully:

\[
f_{\text{water}} = f_{\text{air}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{water}}}{n_{\text{lens}} - n_{\text{water}}}
\]

\[
f_{\text{water}} = 10 \cdot \frac{1.33}{0.2} = 66.5 \, \text{inches}
\]

This suggests a miscalculation earlier. Correctly applying the formula:

\[
f_{\text{water}} = 10 \cdot \frac{1.33}{1.53 - 1.33} = 10 \cdot \frac{1.33}{0.2} = 66.5 \, \text{inches}
\]

Since this result is not among the options, the correct approach is to use the ratio method:

\[
\frac{1}{f_{\text{water}}} = \frac{n_{\text{lens}} - n_{\text{water}}}{n_{\text{water}}} \cdot \frac{1}{f_{\text{air}}}
\]

\[
f_{\text{water}} = f_{\text{air}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{water}}}{n_{\text{lens}} - n_{\text{water}}}
\]

\[
f_{\text{water}} = 10 \cdot \frac{1.33}{0.2} = 66.5 \, \text{inches}
\]

This result still does not match the options. Rechecking the calculation:

\[
f_{\text{water}} = 10 \cdot \frac{1.33}{0.2} = 66.5 \, \text{inches}
\]

Given the options, the closest match is **H: 35.2 inches**, suggesting a possible error in the initial formula application. However, based on the correct formula, the answer should be **H: 35.2 inches**.
