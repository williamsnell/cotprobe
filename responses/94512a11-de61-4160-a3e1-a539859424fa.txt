Okay, so I need to find the ratio of toucans to parrots in the zoo. Let's see, the zoo has 15 toucans and 60 parrots. Ratio problems can sometimes be tricky, but I think I can handle this.

First, I remember that a ratio compares two quantities. Here, I'm comparing the number of toucans to parrots. So, I should write it as toucans:parrots, which would be 15:60.

Wait, but ratios are often simplified to their lowest terms. So, I need to reduce 15:60. To do that, I think I should find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 15 and 60. The factors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, 15, and for 60, they are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60. The highest common factor is 15.

So, I divide both numbers by 15. 15 divided by 15 is 1, and 60 divided by 15 is 4. That simplifies the ratio to 1:4. 

Looking at the options, I need to find which one matches 1:4. Let me check the options again. Option D is 1:04, which is the same as 1:4. That must be the correct answer.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the order. The question asks for the ratio of toucans to parrots, so it's 15:60, which simplifies to 1:4. So yes, D is correct.
