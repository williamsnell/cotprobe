Okay, I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about the three major types of emotional expression. The question gives me options from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one. Let me start by understanding what emotional expression entails. 

Emotional expression refers to the ways humans convey their feelings. From what I remember in psychology, there are different channels through which emotions are expressed. The primary ones I can think of are facial expressions, vocal expressions, and body language or posture. 

Looking at the options:

Option A: Crying, eye movement, and speech tone. Hmm, crying is definitely a form, and speech tone relates to vocal expression. But eye movement seems a bit narrow; it's part of body language but not a major category on its own.

Option B: Verbal expression, physical aggression, artistic creation. Verbal is a major one, but physical aggression doesn't seem right. Artistic creation is more about expression in general, not a primary emotional expression type.

Option C: Startle response, vocal expression, body posture. The startle response is a physiological reaction, which might be part of it, but I'm not sure if it's considered a major type. Vocal and body posture are correct, but startle response seems off.

Option D: Startle response, facial expression, speech. Again, the startle response might not be a major type. Facial expression and speech are correct, but I'm not sure about the startle response.

Option E: Startle response, facial and vocal expression, posture and gestures. This includes facial and vocal, which are two types, and posture/gestures as the third. But the startle response isn't a type of expression itself; it's a reaction.

Option F: Laughter, crying, silence. These are specific expressions but not the major types. They're more like examples rather than categories.

Option G: Facial expression, tone of voice, muscle tension. Tone of voice is part of vocal expression, and facial expression is correct. But muscle tension is a physiological response, not a primary expression type.

Option H: Startle response, body language, eye contact. Body language and eye contact are parts of non-verbal expression, but startle response is a reaction, not a type.

Option I: Facial expression, speech patterns, physiological responses. Facial expression is correct, speech patterns relate to verbal, and physiological responses like sweating or blushing are part of the body's reaction but not a primary expression method.

Option J: Facial expression, dance movements, written language. Dance is a form of body language, and written language is verbal, so this could be plausible, but I'm not sure if these are the major types.

Wait, I think the major types are usually broken down into three categories: facial expressions, vocal expressions (including tone of voice and speech patterns), and body language (posture, gestures, etc.). So looking back, Option E includes facial and vocal as two, but the third is posture and gestures. However, Option I mentions physiological responses, which aren't the same as body language. Option G has facial, tone of voice, and muscle tension, but muscle tension is a physiological response, not a primary expression.

Wait, perhaps the three major types are facial expressions, body language, and vocal expressions. Let me check the options again. Option I says facial, speech patterns (vocal), and physiological responses. But physiological responses are not expressions themselves but reactions. So maybe Option E is better because it includes facial and vocal as two, and posture/gestures as the third. But the startle response in E is confusing.

Alternatively, another perspective: the three types are verbal, non-verbal (body language), and paralanguage (vocal aspects). So verbal expression would include speech patterns, non-verbal includes facial and body gestures, and paralanguage includes tone and pitch. But looking at the options, none exactly match that.

Wait, Option I says facial expression, speech patterns, and physiological responses. That covers two correct types and one incorrect. Option G has facial, tone of voice, and muscle tension. Maybe that's correct because tone of voice is vocal expression, facial is another, and muscle tension could be part of body language, but I'm not sure if that's how it's categorized.

Alternatively, the three major types are facial, vocal, and body expressions. So looking for an option that includes these. Option E includes facial and vocal, but the third is posture and gestures, which is part of body language. So maybe E is correct, but it starts with the startle response, which I'm not sure about.

Wait, perhaps the startle response isn't one of the three types but an example. So maybe the correct answer is E: startle response, facial and vocal, and posture/gestures. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, another thought: the three major types are facial expressions, body language, and vocal expressions. So looking for an option that includes these three. Let me see which option does that.

Option I: facial, speech patterns (vocal), physiological responses (not exactly body language). So not quite.

Option G: facial, tone of voice (vocal), muscle tension (part of body). So that covers two correct and one partial.

Option E: facial and vocal, posture/gestures. That includes two correct and one correct. But the startle response is listed first, which might be a red herring.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E because it correctly lists facial and vocal as two, and posture/gestures as the third, even though it starts with startle response. Alternatively, maybe the startle response isn't part of the three types but an example of a physiological reaction.

Wait, the question asks for the three major types. So the correct answer should list three categories. Let me think again.

Facial expressions, body language (posture, gestures), and vocal expressions (including tone, pitch, speech patterns). So looking for an option that includes these three.

Looking at the options:

Option E: The three major types are the startle response, facial and vocal expression, and posture and gestures.

Hmm, the startle response is a reaction, not a type of expression. So maybe E is incorrect because it includes startle response as one type.

Option I: facial, speech patterns, physiological responses. So two correct and one incorrect.

Option G: facial, tone of voice, muscle tension. Tone is correct, facial correct, muscle tension is a physiological response, not a primary expression.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is I because it includes facial, speech (vocal), and physiological. But I'm not sure if physiological is a primary type.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is E, excluding the startle response. Or perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but among the options, E is the closest.

Wait, another angle: some sources categorize emotional expression into verbal, non-verbal, and paralinguistic. Verbal includes speech patterns, non-verbal includes facial and body, paralinguistic includes tone and pitch.

So among the options, Option I includes facial (non-verbal), speech patterns (verbal), and physiological (which doesn't fit). Option G has facial, tone (paralinguistic), and muscle tension (physiological). So perhaps the correct types are facial, tone, and body language. But none of the options perfectly fit that.

Wait, Option I says physiological responses, which are not expressions but reactions. So maybe the correct answer is I is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E, considering that startle response is a minor point and the rest are correct. Or maybe the answer is I because it includes two correct types and one incorrect, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is I: facial, speech patterns, and physiological responses. But I think physiological responses are more about the body's reaction to emotion rather than the expression itself.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E, despite the startle response. Maybe the startle response is considered a type of emotional expression. I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, I think the three major types are facial, vocal, and body expressions. So looking for an option that includes these three. Let me check again:

Option E: startle response, facial and vocal, posture and gestures. It includes facial and vocal, and posture/gestures as body language. But the startle response is a separate thing.

Option I: facial, speech, physiological. So maybe that's not it.

I think the correct answer is E, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is I, but I'm not certain.
</think>

The correct answer is **E**. The three major types of emotional expression are facial expression, vocal expression, and body language, which includes posture and gestures. While the startle response is not a primary type of emotional expression, it is sometimes considered a physiological reaction to emotions. Therefore, Option E best aligns with the major categories of emotional expression.

Answer: E
