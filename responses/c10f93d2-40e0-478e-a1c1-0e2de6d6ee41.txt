Question:

This question refers to the following information.
On Being Brought from Africa to America
'Twas mercy brought me from my Pagan land,
Taught my benighted soul to understand
That there's a God, that there's a Saviour too;
Once I redemption neither sought nor knew.
Some view our sable race with scornful eye,
"Their colour is a diabolic die."
Remember, Christians, Negroes, black as Cain,
May be refin'd, and join th' angelic train.

Okay, so I need to figure out which of the options best compares to Phillis Wheatley's poem "On Being Brought from Africa to America." Let me start by understanding the poem and then compare it to each option.

Wheatley's poem talks about her experience being brought from Africa to America. She starts by thanking mercy for bringing her to a land where she learned about God and salvation. She then addresses the scorn some people have towards her race, calling their skin color diabolic. She ends with a message that despite being black, they can be refined and join the angelic train, implying that their souls can be saved and they can be equal in God's eyes.

So the main themes here are redemption, equality, and challenging racism through a religious lens. She's using her faith to argue against the dehumanization of her people.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Malcolm X's "The Ballot or the Bullet" speech. This was more about political empowerment and the importance of unity, but I don't recall it being heavily religious. It's more about civil rights and political action.

B: Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream." This speech is all about racial equality, using a religious perspective, especially in the part where he talks about a promenade where people are judged by the content of their character. It emphasizes hope and the possibility of a better future through nonviolent resistance.

C: Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation. This was a political document freeing slaves in Confederate states. It's about legal freedom but doesn't have a religious message or personal narrative.

D: Seneca Falls Declaration. That's about women's rights, so probably not relevant here.

E: Thomas Paine's "Common Sense." This was about American independence, more political than social or religious.

F: Mandela's speech. He talks about the struggle against apartheid, emphasizing sacrifice and the importance of justice, but I'm not sure it's as focused on the religious themes as Wheatley's poem.

G: Frederick Douglass's "What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?" This is a scathing critique of American hypocrisy, pointing out the contradiction of celebrating freedom while holding slaves. It's more of a harsh criticism without the hopeful message of redemption.

H: Jonathan Edwards's sermon. This was a Puritan sermon about sin and damnation, more about individual salvation through fear of God, not really about racial equality.

I: JFK's Berlin speech. It's about solidarity with the people of Berlin against communism, not about race or redemption.

J: Declaration of Independence. It's a political document about independence, not focused on social issues or religion.

So, comparing Wheatley's themes of redemption, equality, and challenging racism through a religious lens, the closest option is B: MLK's "I Have a Dream" speech. Both use religion to talk about equality and hope for a better future. MLK's speech is more about civil rights and public speaking, while Wheatley's is a poem, but the underlying themes of faith and racial equality align closely.

The poem by Phillis Wheatley emphasizes themes of redemption, racial equality, and challenging racism through a religious lens. Comparing this to the options, Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech aligns closely, as it also uses a religious perspective to advocate for racial equality and a hopeful future. 

Answer: B
