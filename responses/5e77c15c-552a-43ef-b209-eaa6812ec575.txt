Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it correctly.

The question says: A sand bag has a mass of 5kg and weighs 50N on Earth. What is the mass and weight of this sand bag on a planet with half the gravity compared to Earth? Then it gives me options A through J.

Hmm, right. I remember that weight is different from mass. Mass is the amount of matter in an object, so it stays the same no matter where you are. But weight depends on gravity because weight is the force due to gravity acting on the mass.

Wait, on Earth, the standard gravity is about 9.8 m/s². So weight is calculated as mass times gravitational acceleration. So the formula is W = m * g. Here, on Earth, the weight is 50N, which should equal 5kg times g. Let me check that: 5 kg * 9.8 m/s² = 49 N, which is approximately 50N. So that makes sense.

Now, the question is about a planet with half the gravity of Earth. So Earth's gravity is g, and this new planet's gravity is 0.5g, which would be about 4.9 m/s², right?

So the mass of the sand bag doesn't change because mass is an intrinsic property. So the mass remains 5kg. But the weight will change because the gravitational acceleration is different.

Using the weight formula again, W = m * g_planet. So plugging in the numbers: 5kg * 4.9 m/s² ≈ 24.5 N. But looking at the options, I don't see an option with 24.5 N. The closest one is 25N, which would be option B or G.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option B is Mass 5kg, weight 25N. That seems correct because 5kg * 4.9 is roughly 24.5, which rounds to 25. Alternatively, the planet's gravity might be exactly half, so 50N on Earth would be 25N on this planet. Oh, wait, that's another way to think about it. Because if the gravity is half, then the weight is half. So 50N / 2 = 25N. That makes sense too.

So the mass stays 5kg, and the weight is 25N. Looking at the options, option B is Mass 5kg weight 25N.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other options. Option I says mass 5kg, weight 10N. That would be if gravity was a quarter of Earth's, because 50N divided by 5 is 10N. So that's not the case here. The question says half gravity, so 25N is the right weight.

I think I've got it. So the answer should be option B.

The mass remains 5kg, and the weight is halved to 25N. 

Answer: B
