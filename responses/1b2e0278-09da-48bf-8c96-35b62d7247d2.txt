H: Statement 1 is completely false, Statement 2 is partially true
I: True, False
J: Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is mostly true

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about two statements related to machine learning concepts. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, the question has two statements, Statement 1 and Statement 2, and I need to evaluate each for their truthfulness. Then, based on that, I'll choose the correct option from A to J.

Let's look at Statement 1: "RoBERTa pretrains on a corpus that is approximately 10x larger than the corpus BERT pretrained on." I remember that BERT and RoBERTa are both transformer-based models used for NLP tasks. BERT was introduced by Google, and RoBERTa was developed by Facebook, I think. 

From what I've read, BERT was pre-trained on a large corpus, but RoBERTa used an even larger one. I recall that RoBERTa used a corpus that was about 10 times bigger than BERT's. So Statement 1 seems to be true. But wait, I should double-check. I think BERT used the combined BookCorpus and Wikipedia, which is around 16GB. RoBERTa, on the other hand, used a larger dataset, maybe around 160GB, which is roughly 10 times bigger. So yeah, Statement 1 is probably true.

Now, Statement 2: "ResNeXts in 2018 usually used tanh activation functions." ResNeXts are a type of residual network, right? I remember that ResNet, introduced by He et al., used ReLU as the activation function. Since ResNeXt is an extension of ResNet, I think they would have followed the same trend. Tanh is another activation function, but I believe it's not the one typically used in ResNeXt models. So Statement 2 is probably false because ResNeXt models in 2018 would have used ReLU or maybe another function, but not tanh.

Wait, could there be exceptions? I think the original ResNet and thus ResNeXt used ReLU, so unless a specific variant used tanh, which I don't recall, Statement 2 is false.

So putting it together: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false. Looking at the options, that would correspond to option I: True, False.

But just to make sure, I'll think again. Did RoBERTa's corpus size compare exactly 10x? I think it's around that, but maybe not exactly. However, the statement says "approximately 10x," which seems correct. As for ResNeXt, I'm confident they didn't use tanh; ReLU was standard in 2018. So yes, I'll go with I.

The evaluation of the two statements leads to the conclusion that Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false. Therefore, the correct answer is:

I: True, False

Answer: I
