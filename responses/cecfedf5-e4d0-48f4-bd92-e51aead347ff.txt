<think>
Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the enthalpy of formation of D-ribose using calorimetry data. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on calorimetry, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that calorimetry is used to measure the heat released or absorbed during a chemical reaction. Since the problem involves combustion, which is exothermic, the calorimeter will absorb the heat, causing a temperature rise.

The problem gives me two experiments. The first one is with D-ribose, and the second is with benzoic acid. The benzoic acid experiment is probably a calibration to find the calorimeter constant because benzoic acid's internal energy of combustion is given.

Let me jot down the data:

For benzoic acid:
Mass = 0.825 g
Temperature rise, ΔT = 1.940 K
Internal energy of combustion, ΔU = -3251 kJ/mol

For D-ribose:
Mass = 0.727 g
Temperature rise, ΔT = 0.910 K
We need to find the enthalpy of formation, which I think is the standard enthalpy of combustion, but wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, the enthalpy of formation is calculated using the enthalpies of combustion of the reactants and products. Oh wait, but maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, no, the problem is about finding the enthalpy of formation of D-ribose, which would involve knowing the enthalpy change of its combustion. But perhaps the calorimeter data will give me the heat released when D-ribose combusts, and from that, I can find the enthalpy of combustion, and then use that to calculate the enthalpy of formation.

Wait, but first, I need to find the calorimeter constant. The calorimeter constant (C) is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of the calorimeter by 1 K. It can be determined using the benzoic acid data because we know the heat released and the temperature change.

So, the heat released (q) when benzoic acid combusts is equal to the calorimeter constant multiplied by the temperature change: q = C * ΔT.

But wait, the internal energy change (ΔU) is given as -3251 kJ/mol. Internal energy and enthalpy are related by ΔH = ΔU + Δn_gas * R*T, but maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps for this problem, we'll assume that the heat released at constant volume (since it's a bomb calorimeter) is ΔU, and the calorimeter measures q_v, which is ΔU. So maybe we can use q = n * ΔU.

Wait, but benzoic acid is used to find the calorimeter constant. So let's proceed.

First, find the moles of benzoic acid burned. The formula for benzoic acid is C7H6O2. The molar mass would be (7*12) + (6*1) + (2*16) = 84 + 6 + 32 = 122 g/mol.

So, moles = mass / molar mass = 0.825 g / 122 g/mol ≈ 0.00676 mol.

The internal energy change is ΔU = -3251 kJ/mol. Since the reaction is exothermic, the heat released (q) is positive. So, q = moles * |ΔU| ?

Wait, no. Because ΔU is the change in internal energy for the system. The heat released by the system (benzoic acid combustion) is q_v = ΔU. So, q_v is negative because it's exothermic, but the calorimeter absorbs this heat, so the calorimeter's temperature increases. So the heat absorbed by the calorimeter is equal in magnitude to the heat released by the reaction.

So, q_calorimeter = -q_reaction.

So, for benzoic acid, q = C * ΔT = moles * ΔU.

Wait, no, because for the reaction, q_reaction = ΔU = -3251 kJ/mol (since it's exothermic). So the calorimeter absorbs heat equal to the negative of that. So, C * ΔT = -ΔU * moles.

Wait, maybe it's better to write it as:

The heat released by the reaction is q_reaction = n * ΔU.

Since the calorimeter absorbs this heat, q_calorimeter = q_reaction.

So, C * ΔT = n * |ΔU| ?

Wait, no, because ΔU is negative (exothermic). So perhaps:

C * ΔT = n * (-ΔU) ?

Wait, let me think. The internal energy change for the reaction is ΔU = -3251 kJ/mol. So the reaction releases heat, which is absorbed by the calorimeter. So the heat absorbed by the calorimeter, q_cal, is equal to -ΔU * n.

So, q_cal = C * ΔT = n * (-ΔU).

So, rearranged, C = (n * -ΔU) / ΔT.

Wait, but ΔU is negative because the reaction is exothermic. So let me plug in the numbers.

n = 0.825 g / 122 g/mol ≈ 0.00676 mol.

ΔU = -3251 kJ/mol.

ΔT = 1.940 K.

So, C = (0.00676 mol * (-(-3251 kJ/mol))) / 1.940 K.

Wait, wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me re-express.

ΔU is -3251 kJ/mol, so the reaction releases 3251 kJ per mole. So the calorimeter absorbs 3251 kJ per mole * moles.

So, q = n * 3251 kJ/mol.

But q is also C * ΔT.

So, C = (n * 3251 kJ/mol) / ΔT.

Wait, that makes sense because the more heat released, the higher the calorimeter constant.

So, substituting the values:

n = 0.825 / 122 = 0.00676 mol.

ΔT = 1.940 K.

C = (0.00676 mol * 3251 kJ/mol) / 1.940 K.

Let me compute that.

0.00676 * 3251 ≈ let's compute 0.00676 * 3000 = 20.28, and 0.00676 * 251 ≈ 1.697, so total ≈ 21.977 kJ.

Then, 21.977 kJ / 1.940 K ≈ 11.33 kJ/K. So C ≈ 11.33 kJ/K.

Wait, that seems a bit high, but let's go with it for now.

Now, for the D-ribose combustion:

Mass of D-ribose = 0.727 g.

I need to find the moles. The formula for D-ribose is C5H10O5. Let me calculate the molar mass.

C: 5 *12 =60, H:10*1=10, O:5*16=80. Total =60+10+80=150 g/mol.

Molar mass = 150 g/mol.

Moles of D-ribose = 0.727 g / 150 g/mol ≈ 0.004847 mol.

Now, the temperature rise is 0.910 K.

The heat released by the combustion of D-ribose is q = C * ΔT = 11.33 kJ/K * 0.910 K ≈ 10.30 kJ.

Wait, but wait, since the reaction is exothermic, the heat released is positive, and the calorimeter absorbs it. So the heat released by the reaction is q_reaction = -q_calorimeter.

Wait, no, because the calorimeter absorbs the heat, so q_cal = C * ΔT, which is positive. The reaction's q is negative because it's exothermic.

So, for the reaction:

q_reaction = -10.30 kJ.

But wait, q_reaction is the heat at constant volume, which is ΔU. So ΔU = q_v.

So, ΔU = -10.30 kJ for the combustion of 0.004847 mol of D-ribose.

But wait, the problem asks for the enthalpy of formation, not the enthalpy of combustion. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The enthalpy change for the combustion of D-ribose is ΔH_combustion. But in the calorimeter, we're measuring ΔU because it's a constant volume calorimeter (bomb calorimeter). So we have ΔU for the combustion, but to find ΔH, we can use ΔH = ΔU + Δn_gas * R * T.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the enthalpy of combustion, which I can convert from ΔU to ΔH, and then use that to find the enthalpy of formation.

Wait, but the problem says "calculate the enthalpy of formation of D-ribose." So perhaps I need to use the enthalpy of combustion of D-ribose to find its enthalpy of formation using Hess's law.

Wait, let me recall. The standard enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy change when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, for D-ribose (C5H10O5), the combustion reaction would be:

C5H10O5(s) + O2(g) → CO2(g) + H2O(l)

The standard enthalpy of combustion is the enthalpy change for this reaction. Once I have that, I can use the standard enthalpies of formation of CO2 and H2O to find the enthalpy of formation of D-ribose.

So, first, I need to find the ΔH_combustion of D-ribose.

But the calorimeter gives me the ΔU_combustion. So I need to convert ΔU to ΔH.

The formula is ΔH = ΔU + Δn_gas * R * T.

Where Δn_gas is the change in moles of gas in the reaction.

So, let's write the balanced combustion equation for D-ribose.

The formula is C5H10O5. The combustion reaction is:

C5H10O5(s) + O2(g) → CO2(g) + H2O(l)

Let me balance this equation.

First, count the carbons: 5 on the left, so 5 CO2 on the right.

Hydrogen: 10 H on the left, so 5 H2O on the right (since 5 H2O gives 10 H).

Oxygen on the left: O2 is the reactant. On the right, we have 5 CO2 (5*2=10 O) and 5 H2O (5*1=5 O), total 15 O. So we have 15 O on the right from the products.

The reactant side has O2, so let's see how much O2 is needed.

Each O2 molecule provides 2 O atoms. So total O needed is 15.

So O2 needed = 15/2 = 7.5 moles.

So the balanced equation is:

C5H10O5(s) + 7.5 O2(g) → 5 CO2(g) + 5 H2O(l)

Now, Δn_gas is moles of gaseous products minus moles of gaseous reactants.

Reactants: 7.5 moles of O2 (gas).

Products: 5 moles of CO2 (gas) + 5 moles H2O (liquid), which is not gas.

So Δn_gas = 5 - 7.5 = -2.5 moles.

Now, R is 8.314 J/mol·K, and T is 298 K (assuming standard conditions).

So, ΔH = ΔU + Δn_gas * R * T.

But wait, the ΔU I calculated earlier is -10.30 kJ for 0.004847 mol. Let me compute the molar ΔU first.

So, for 0.004847 mol, ΔU is -10.30 kJ. So per mole, ΔU = (-10.30 kJ) / 0.004847 mol ≈ -2125.3 kJ/mol.

Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check.

Wait, earlier I found that the heat released by burning 0.727 g D-ribose was 10.30 kJ. So 0.727 g is 0.004847 mol, so per mole, it's 10.30 kJ / 0.004847 mol ≈ 2125.3 kJ/mol, but since it's exothermic, ΔU is -2125.3 kJ/mol.

Wait, but that seems very high. Let me think again. Benzoic acid's ΔU is -3251 kJ/mol, which is about -3260 kJ/mol. D-ribose is a sugar, so its combustion should release a lot of energy, but maybe 2125 kJ/mol is reasonable.

Wait, but let's proceed.

So, Δn_gas = -2.5 moles.

So, Δn_gas * R * T = (-2.5) * 8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K.

Compute that:

8.314 * 298 ≈ 2477.572 J/mol.

Multiply by -2.5: 2477.572 * (-2.5) ≈ -6193.93 J/mol ≈ -6.194 kJ/mol.

So, ΔH = ΔU + (-6.194 kJ/mol).

But wait, ΔU is in kJ/mol. So ΔU is -2125.3 kJ/mol.

So, ΔH = (-2125.3) + (-6.194) ≈ -2131.5 kJ/mol.

Wait, but this seems like an extremely large value. Let me check. Benzoic acid is -3251 kJ/mol, and D-ribose is a carbohydrate, which has a high enthalpy of combustion. So maybe it's correct.

Now, the enthalpy of combustion (ΔH_combustion) is -2131.5 kJ/mol. Now, using this, we can find the enthalpy of formation of D-ribose.

The standard enthalpy of combustion is given by:

ΔH_combustion = [5 ΔH_f(CO2) + 5 ΔH_f(H2O)] - [ΔH_f(D-ribose) + 7.5 ΔH_f(O2)]

But ΔH_f for O2 is zero because it's an element in its standard state. So,

ΔH_combustion = 5 ΔH_f(CO2) + 5 ΔH_f(H2O) - ΔH_f(D-ribose)

We can rearrange to solve for ΔH_f(D-ribose):

ΔH_f(D-ribose) = 5 ΔH_f(CO2) + 5 ΔH_f(H2O) - ΔH_combustion

I need the standard enthalpies of formation for CO2 and H2O. From tables, I recall:

ΔH_f(CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol

ΔH_f(H2O, l) = -285.8 kJ/mol

So plugging these in:

ΔH_f(D-ribose) = 5*(-393.5) + 5*(-285.8) - (-2131.5)

Calculate each term:

5*(-393.5) = -1967.5 kJ

5*(-285.8) = -1429 kJ

Sum of products: (-1967.5) + (-1429) = -3396.5 kJ

Then, subtract ΔH_combustion (which is -2131.5 kJ), so:

ΔH_f(D-ribose) = -3396.5 - (-2131.5) = -3396.5 + 2131.5 = -1265 kJ/mol.

Wait, that's approximately -1265 kJ/mol. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option D is -1270, which is close. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recheck the numbers.

ΔH_combustion came out to be -2131.5 kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait, earlier I had ΔU as -2125.3 kJ/mol, then ΔH = ΔU + (-6.194) = -2125.3 -6.194 ≈ -2131.5 kJ/mol.

But let me double-check the calculation of Δn_gas * R*T.

Δn_gas = moles of gaseous products - moles of gaseous reactants.

Products: 5 CO2 (gas) and 5 H2O (liquid). So 5 moles gas.

Reactants: 7.5 O2 (gas). So 7.5 moles gas.

Δn_gas = 5 -7.5 = -2.5.

So, Δn_gas = -2.5.

Then, Δn_gas * R*T = (-2.5) * 8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K.

Compute 8.314 * 298: 8 * 300 = 2400, but more accurately,

8.314 * 298 = let's compute 8 * 298 = 2384, 0.314*298 ≈ 93.772, total ≈ 2384 +93.772=2477.772 J/mol.

Multiply by -2.5: 2477.772 * (-2.5) = -6194.43 J/mol ≈ -6.194 kJ/mol.

So yes, that part is correct.

So ΔH = ΔU + (-6.194) kJ/mol = (-2125.3) + (-6.194) ≈ -2131.494 kJ/mol.

Now, using this in the enthalpy of formation equation.

Wait, but earlier, I think I might have made a mistake in the sign when calculating ΔH_f(D-ribose).

Wait, the equation is:

ΔH_combustion = [5 ΔHf(CO2) + 5 ΔHf(H2O)] - [ΔHf(D-ribose) + 7.5 ΔHf(O2)]

Since ΔHf(O2) is 0, it's:

ΔH_combustion = 5(-393.5) +5(-285.8) - ΔHf(D-ribose)

So,

ΔH_combustion = -1967.5 -1429 - ΔHf(D-ribose)

Which is,

ΔH_combustion = -3396.5 - ΔHf(D-ribose)

Rearranged,

ΔHf(D-ribose) = -3396.5 - ΔH_combustion

Wait, no, wait. If ΔH_combustion = -3396.5 - ΔHf(D-ribose), then:

ΔHf(D-ribose) = -3396.5 - ΔH_combustion.

Wait, no, wait: Let me write it correctly.

ΔH_combustion = [sum products] - [sum reactants]

sum_products = 5*(-393.5) +5*(-285.8) = -1967.5 -1429 = -3396.5

sum_reactants = ΔHf(D-ribose) +7.5*(0) = ΔHf(D-ribose)

So,

ΔH_combustion = sum_products - sum_reactants

=> ΔH_combustion = (-3396.5) - ΔHf(D-ribose)

Rearranged,

ΔHf(D-ribose) = (-3396.5) - ΔH_combustion

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

The correct formula is:

ΔH_combustion = [sum (ΔHf products)] - [sum (ΔHf reactants)]

So,

ΔH_combustion = [5*(-393.5) +5*(-285.8)] - [ΔHf(D-ribose) +7.5*0]

So,

ΔH_combustion = (-1967.5 -1429) - ΔHf(D-ribose)

=> ΔH_combustion = (-3396.5) - ΔHf(D-ribose)

Then, solving for ΔHf(D-ribose):

ΔHf(D-ribose) = (-3396.5) - ΔH_combustion

But ΔH_combustion is negative, so:

ΔHf(D-ribose) = (-3396.5) - (-2131.5) = -3396.5 +2131.5 = -1265 kJ/mol.

Wait, that's what I had before.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D: -1270 kJ/mol, but maybe I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, let me double-check the moles of D-ribose.

Mass = 0.727 g

Molar mass = 150 g/mol → 0.727 / 150 ≈ 0.004847 mol.

Heat released (q) = C * ΔT = 11.33 kJ/K *0.910 K ≈10.30 kJ.

ΔU = q_reaction = -10.30 kJ for 0.004847 mol.

So per mole, ΔU = -10.30 / 0.004847 ≈ -2125.3 kJ/mol.

Then ΔH = ΔU + (-6.194) ≈ -2131.5 kJ/mol.

So, ΔH_combustion = -2131.5 kJ/mol.

Then,

ΔHf(D-ribose) = (-3396.5) - (-2131.5) = -3396.5 +2131.5 = -1265 kJ/mol.

Hmm, but none of the options exactly match. The closest is option D: -1270, which is -1270. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the number of moles.

Wait, let me recheck the moles of benzoic acid.

Benzoic acid mass = 0.825 g.

Molar mass: C7H6O2 → 7*12=84, 6*1=6, 2*16=32. Total 84+6+32=122 g/mol.

Moles = 0.825 /122 = let's compute: 122 * 0.00676 is approximately 0.825.

So, 0.825 /122 = 0.006762 mol.

So, correct.

Then, C = (n * |ΔU|) / ΔT.

n=0.006762, ΔU=3251 kJ/mol, ΔT=1.940 K.

So, C = (0.006762 *3251)/1.940 ≈ (21.977) /1.940 ≈11.33 kJ/K.

That's correct.

Now, for D-ribose: ΔT=0.910 K.

q = C * ΔT =11.33 *0.910 ≈10.30 kJ.

But that's the heat absorbed by the calorimeter, so the reaction released 10.30 kJ.

But wait, in the benzoic acid case, the reaction released 3251 kJ per mole, and the calorimeter absorbed that, causing a temperature rise.

For D-ribose, the calorimeter absorbed 10.30 kJ, so the reaction released 10.30 kJ.

Moles of D-ribose is 0.727 /150 = 0.004847 mol.

So, ΔU = -10.30 kJ /0.004847 mol ≈-2125.3 kJ/mol.

Then, ΔH = ΔU + (-6.194) ≈-2131.5 kJ/mol.

Then, using the standard enthalpies of formation:

ΔH_combustion = 5*(-393.5) +5*(-285.8) - [ΔHf(D-ribose) + 0]

So,

ΔH_combustion = -1967.5 -1429 - ΔHf(D-ribose)

Which rearranges to:

ΔHf(D-ribose) = (-3396.5) - ΔH_combustion.

But ΔH_combustion is -2131.5.

Thus,

ΔHf(D-ribose) = (-3396.5) - (-2131.5) = (-3396.5) +2131.5 = -1265 kJ/mol.

Hmm, the options don't have -1265. The closest is option D: -1270.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ΔH_combustion.

Wait, perhaps I should consider whether the reaction is per mole of D-ribose or per gram. Wait no, because the moles were calculated correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the calorimeter constant.

Wait, let me recompute the calorimeter constant.

n = 0.825 /122 = 0.006762 mol.

ΔU = -3251 kJ/mol → so the heat released is 3251 kJ per mole.

So, q = n * 3251 kJ/mol = 0.006762 *3251 ≈21.977 kJ.

This is absorbed by the calorimeter, so C = q / ΔT = 21.977 kJ /1.940 K ≈11.33 kJ/K. Correct.

So, that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of ΔH_combustion. Let me recheck.

ΔH_combustion = ΔU + Δn_gas * R*T.

Δn_gas =5 CO2 (g) +5 H2O (l) -7.5 O2(g) → 5 -7.5 =-2.5.

So, Δn_gas =-2.5.

R=8.314 J/mol·K, T=298 K.

Δn_gas * R*T = (-2.5)(8.314)(298).

Compute 8.314 * 298 = let's compute:

8 *298=2384, 0.314*298=93.772 → 2384+93.772=2477.772 J/mol.

Multiply by -2.5: 2477.772 * (-2.5) =-6194.43 J/mol = -6.194 kJ/mol.

Thus, ΔH = ΔU + (-6.194) = (-2125.3) + (-6.194) =-2131.494 kJ/mol.

So that's correct.

Then, using:

ΔH_combustion = sum products - sum reactants.

sum products:5*(-393.5) +5*(-285.8) = -1967.5 -1429 =-3396.5.

sum reactants: ΔHf(D-ribose) +7.5*0=ΔHf(D-ribose).

So,

ΔH_combustion = (-3396.5) - ΔHf(D-ribose).

Rearranged,

ΔHf(D-ribose) = (-3396.5) - ΔH_combustion.

But ΔH_combustion is -2131.5.

So,

ΔHf(D-ribose) = -3396.5 - (-2131.5) =-3396.5 +2131.5 =-1265 kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the problem is using enthalpy of combustion at constant pressure, but I used the calorimeter's constant volume. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using enthalpy of combustion as the same as the calorimetry value, which is ΔU.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used ΔH_combustion = q_p, but in a bomb calorimeter, we measure ΔU.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to not convert ΔU to ΔH, but to use the enthalpy of combustion as the same as ΔU.

Wait, no, because in a bomb calorimeter, we measure ΔU, but the standard enthalpy of combustion is ΔH.

Wait, but perhaps the question is considering that the enthalpy of combustion is the same as the value measured, which is ΔU, so perhaps I should not have converted ΔU to ΔH.

Wait, no, because the standard enthalpy of combustion is at constant pressure, and the calorimeter measures at constant volume, so they are different. So I think I did the right thing.

But if I don't convert ΔU to ΔH, then ΔH_combustion would be considered as ΔU, which is -2125.3 kJ/mol.

Wait, but that can't be right because the standard enthalpy of combustion is ΔH, not ΔU.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the same value for both, but that's incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the enthalpy of combustion, not the formation. Wait, no, the question is about enthalpy of formation.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the moles of D-ribose.

Wait, D-ribose is C5H10O5, so molar mass is (5*12)+(10*1)+(5*16)=60+10+80=150 g/mol.

Mass is 0.727 g, so moles =0.727/150=0.0048467 mol. Correct.

So, the heat released is 10.30 kJ, so per mole, it's 10.30 /0.0048467 ≈2125 kJ/mol, so ΔU is -2125 kJ/mol.

Then, converting to ΔH gives -2131.5 kJ/mol.

So, using that, the enthalpy of formation comes to -1265 kJ/mol, but the options don't have that. The closest is option D: -1270.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the calculation of ΔH_combustion.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the enthalpy of combustion as the same as the calorimeter value, not converting to ΔH. Let's try that.

If I use ΔU as the enthalpy of combustion (which is incorrect, but perhaps the problem expects that), then:

ΔH_combustion = -2125 kJ/mol.

Then,

ΔHf(D-ribose) = (-3396.5) - (-2125) = -3396.5 +2125 = -1271.5 kJ/mol.

Which is approximately -1270 kJ/mol, matching option D.

Ah, so perhaps the problem assumes that the calorimeter gives the enthalpy change at constant pressure, which isn't correct, but perhaps that's what they expect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me re-express the equation.

Wait, the equation is:

ΔH_combustion = [sum ΔHf products] - [sum ΔHf reactants]

sum products: 5*(-393.5) +5*(-285.8) =-3396.5.

sum reactants: ΔHf(D-ribose) + 7.5*(0) = ΔHf(D-ribose).

So,

ΔH_combustion = (-3396.5) - ΔHf(D-ribose)

Rearranged,

ΔHf(D-ribose) = (-3396.5) - ΔH_combustion

If ΔH_combustion is taken as -2125 kJ/mol (without converting ΔU to ΔH), then:

ΔHf(D-ribose) = -3396.5 - (-2125) = -3396.5 +2125 = -1271.5 kJ/mol ≈-1270 kJ/mol.

So, that gives option D as the answer.

But wait, this approach ignores the conversion from ΔU to ΔH, which is incorrect in a strict sense, but perhaps the problem expects this approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the ΔU directly without converting to ΔH, which would give the answer as D.

Given that, I think the intended answer is D: -1270 kJ/mol.

To calculate the enthalpy of formation of D-ribose, the calorimeter constant was first determined using benzoic acid. The heat released by the combustion of benzoic acid was used to calculate the calorimeter constant, \( C \), using the formula:

\[
C = \frac{n \cdot |ΔU|}{ΔT}
\]

where \( n \) is the moles of benzoic acid, \( ΔU \) is the internal energy of combustion, and \( ΔT \) is the temperature rise. Substituting the values:

\[
n = \frac{0.825 \, \text{g}}{122 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00676 \, \text{mol}, \quad ΔU = -3251 \, \text{kJ/mol}, \quad ΔT = 1.940 \, \text{K}
\]

\[
C = \frac{0.00676 \cdot 3251}{1.940} \approx 11.33 \, \text{kJ/K}.
\]

Next, the heat released by the combustion of D-ribose was calculated using the calorimeter constant:

\[
q = C \cdot ΔT = 11.33 \, \text{kJ/K} \cdot 0.910 \, \text{K} \approx 10.30 \, \text{kJ}.
\]

The moles of D-ribose were determined using its molar mass (\( 150 \, \text{g/mol} \)):

\[
n = \frac{0.727 \, \text{g}}{150 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.004847 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The internal energy of combustion (\( ΔU \)) per mole of D-ribose was then calculated:

\[
ΔU = \frac{-10.30 \, \text{kJ}}{0.004847 \, \text{mol}} \approx -2125.3 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
\]

To convert \( ΔU \) to \( ΔH \), the formula \( ΔH = ΔU + Δn_{\text{gas}} \cdot R \cdot T \) was used, where \( Δn_{\text{gas}} \) is the change in moles of gas. For the combustion reaction:

\[
\text{C}_5\text{H}_{10}\text{O}_5(s) + 7.5 \, \text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 5 \, \text{CO}_2(g) + 5 \, \text{H}_2\text{O}(l),
\]

\[
Δn_{\text{gas}} = 5 - 7.5 = -2.5.
\]

Substituting \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K} \) and \( T = 298 \, \text{K} \):

\[
Δn_{\text{gas}} \cdot R \cdot T = (-2.5) \cdot 8.314 \cdot 298 \approx -6.194 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
\]

Thus:

\[
ΔH = ΔU + (-6.194) \approx -2125.3 - 6.194 \approx -2131.5 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
\]

The standard enthalpy of combustion (\( ΔH_{\text{combustion}} \)) was then used to calculate the enthalpy of formation (\( ΔH_f \)) of D-ribose using the formula:

\[
ΔH_{\text{combustion}} = \left[ 5 \cdot ΔH_f(\text{CO}_2) + 5 \cdot ΔH_f(\text{H}_2\text{O}) \right] - ΔH_f(\text{D-ribose}),
\]

where \( ΔH_f(\text{CO}_2) = -393.5 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) and \( ΔH_f(\text{H}_2\text{O}) = -285.8 \, \text{kJ/mol} \). Substituting:

\[
ΔH_{\text{combustion}} = 5(-393.5) + 5(-285.8) - ΔH_f(\text{D-ribose}),
\]

\[
ΔH_{\text{combustion}} = -1967.5 - 1429 - ΔH_f(\text{D-ribose}),
\]

\[
ΔH_{\text{combustion}} = -3396.5 - ΔH_f(\text{D-ribose}).
\]

Rearranging for \( ΔH_f(\text{D-ribose}) \):

\[
ΔH_f(\text{D-ribose}) = -3396.5 - ΔH_{\text{combustion}}.
\]

Substituting \( ΔH_{\text{combustion}} = -2131.5 \, \text{kJ/mol} \):

\[
ΔH_f(\text{D-ribose}) = -3396.5 - (-2131.5) = -3396.5 + 2131.5 = -1265 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
\]

However, the closest option provided is **D: -1270 kJ/mol**, which likely accounts for rounding or slight approximations in the problem setup.
