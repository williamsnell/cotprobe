Question:

Describe the evolution of the reptilian excretory system to account for the transition from an aquatic to a terrestrial habitat.

Options:

A: The excretory system includes a secondary bladder for water storage.
B: The reptilian excretory system has evolved to excrete more water
C: Reptiles have evolved to have a smooth, wet skin
D: Reptiles have evolved to excrete nitrogenous wastes primarily as ammonia to conserve water.
E: Reptiles have developed larger glomeruli to increase water retention.
F: The excretory system has adapted to increase salt excretion to facilitate life in marine environments.
G: Reptilian kidneys have evolved to produce ammonia directly for more efficient water use.
H: Reptiles excrete nitrogenous wastes as urea
I: The excretory system has evolved a complex series of ducts to recycle water back into the body.
J: The reptilian excretory system has evolved to conserve most of its water with modifications like a coarse, dry, horny skin, decreased size of glomeruli, greater reabsorption of water from glomerular filtrate, and excretion of nitrogenous wastes as uric acid.

Okay, so I've got this question about the evolution of the reptilian excretory system. Hmm, I need to figure out which option correctly describes how reptiles adapted their excretory systems to move from water to land. Let me think.

First, I remember that when animals move from water to land, their environment changes a lot. Water is abundant in the water, so they don't need to conserve it. On land, especially in dry environments, water conservation becomes super important. So the excretory system must have evolved to help with that.

Reptiles are considered more advanced than amphibians in their excretory systems. I think they produce a different kind of waste compared to, say, amphibians. Wait, amphibians excrete ammonia, which is highly toxic and requires a lot of water to dilute. But since they're on land, maybe they process their waste differently to save water.

Oh right, I remember that reptiles, birds, and mammals excrete uric acid. Uric acid is less toxic than ammonia and can be excreted in a more concentrated form, meaning less water is lost. So how does that tie into their excretory system?

Looking at the options, let's go through them. Option A talks about a secondary bladder for water storage. That sounds more like what desert animals might have, but I'm not sure if that's the main adaptation for moving onto land.

Option B says the excretory system excretes more water. Wait, that doesn't make sense because on land, you want to conserve water, not excrete more. So probably not B.

Option C is about smooth, wet skin. That doesn't sound right because reptiles have dry, scaly skin for water conservation. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D claims they excrete ammonia to conserve water. But if they're on land, excreting ammonia would be bad because it's toxic and requires more water. So D might be incorrect.

Option E says larger glomeruli for water retention. I'm not sure. Glomeruli are part of the kidneys, and if they're larger, maybe they filter more, but I'm not certain if that's the main adaptation. Maybe not E.

Option F is about increased salt excretion for marine environments. Not sure how this relates to moving to land in general. Plus, not all reptiles live in marine environments.

Option G says they produce ammonia directly. That seems similar to D and probably not correct because ammonia isn't efficient on land.

Option H says they excrete urea. But I thought reptiles excrete uric acid, not urea. Urea is more common in mammals, I think. So H might be wrong.

Option I mentions a complex duct system to recycle water. I'm not sure about that. Maybe some systems have that, but I don't remember that being the main adaptation for terrestrial life.

Option J: The excretory system has modifications like coarse, dry skin, smaller glomeruli, more water reabsorption, and excretion of uric acid. That sounds right because uric acid uses less water, and dry skin prevents water loss. Smaller glomeruli might relate to more efficient concentration of urine, which would help conserve water.

So putting it together, the reptilian excretory system evolved to conserve water by producing uric acid, having dry skin, and modifying their kidneys to reabsorb more water. So the correct answer should be J.

The correct answer is J. Reptiles evolved modifications in their excretory system, such as producing uric acid, having dry, horny skin, smaller glomeruli, and increased reabsorption of water from filtrate, to conserve water and adapt to terrestrial life.

Answer: J
