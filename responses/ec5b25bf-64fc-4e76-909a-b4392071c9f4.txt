Okay, so I need to figure out the correct translation of the sentence "Caroline is sweet if, and only if, Janet is engaged to Brad" into predicate logic. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I should identify the structure of the sentence. The main connective here is "if and only if," which in logic translates to a biconditional operator (≡). So whatever is on the left side is equivalent to whatever is on the right side.

Next, I need to parse the two parts of the biconditional. The first part is "Caroline is sweet." In predicate terms, this would be a predicate applied to Caroline. Let's denote "is sweet" as S. So "Caroline is sweet" would be S(C), where C represents Caroline. Wait, but in predicate logic, we usually use uppercase letters for predicates and lowercase for individuals, but sometimes the variables are used as constants. Alternatively, maybe the predicates are one-letter capitals, and the subjects are lowercase letters. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about that. Let's think: in the options, I see things like Sx, Jy, etc., so perhaps the variables are x, y, etc., and the predicates are S, J, etc.

Wait, the subject here is Caroline, so perhaps her name is represented as a constant, maybe 'c' or 'C'. Similarly, Janet would be 'j' or 'J', and Brad as 'b' or 'B'. Let me check the options. Looking at the options, I see letters like C, J, B, etc., so perhaps the constants are uppercase letters.

Wait, the options are labeled A to J, each with expressions. Let's see. The sentence is "Caroline is sweet if and only if Janet is engaged to Brad." So the two parts are:

1. Caroline is sweet (S(C))
2. Janet is engaged to Brad (E(J, B)) or perhaps E is a predicate that takes two arguments, but in the options, I don't see any two-variable predicates. Wait, the options are all single-variable predicates with variables, like Sx, Jy, etc. So maybe the predicates are unary, but that doesn't make sense for "engaged to Brad." Alternatively, perhaps "engaged to Brad" is a predicate applied to Janet, like E(j), where E is being engaged to Brad. So E would be a predicate that takes one argument, where the argument is Janet, and E(j) means Janet is engaged to Brad.

Wait, that's possible. So "engaged to Brad" could be a predicate that takes one argument (the person) and means that that person is engaged to Brad. So E(j) would mean Janet is engaged to Brad. Alternatively, maybe E is a binary predicate, but in the options, I don't see any binary predicates, so perhaps the options are using a unary predicate where the engagement is with Brad. So E(j) would mean "Janet is engaged to Brad."

So, putting it together: "Caroline is sweet" is S(c), and "Janet is engaged to Brad" is E(j). So the biconditional would be S(c) ≡ E(j).

Now, looking at the options, let's see which one matches that. The options are labeled A to J, each with expressions.

Option C: Sc ≡ Ej. Hmm, that seems to fit. Sc would be S applied to c (Caroline is sweet), and Ej would be E applied to j (Janet is engaged to Brad). So Sc ≡ Ej is exactly the biconditional we need.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check other options to make sure I'm not missing something.

Option A: Sx ≡ Jy – that's two predicates, but the original sentence is about S and E, not J as a predicate. So probably not.

Option B: Ej ≡ Cs – Ej would be E applied to j, and Cs would be C applied to s? But in the sentence, it's Caroline who is sweet, so S(c) is correct, not C(s). So B doesn't seem right.

Option C: Sc ≡ Ej – Yes, that matches what I thought.

Option D: Cs ⊃ Ej – That's a implication, not a biconditional, so it's only one direction, which doesn't match the "if and only if."

Option E: Se ≡ Cj – Again, using C as a predicate, but the sentence has S and E. So probably not.

Option F: Sj ≡ Ce – Sj would be Janet is sweet, and Ce would be C applied to e? Not matching the original sentence.

Option G: Cj ⊃ Es – Again, using C and E as predicates, but the original has S and E, and direction is implication, not biconditional.

Option H: sC ≡ eJ – This seems like it's using lowercase variables, which might represent the constants. So sC could be S(C), and eJ could be E(J). But I'm not sure if the notation is correct. In predicate logic, typically predicates are uppercase, and the arguments are lowercase. So S(c) would be correct, not sC. So H might not be the right notation.

Option I: Cs ≡ Bj – Cs is C applied to s, which doesn't match. Bj would be B applied to j, but B isn't in the original sentence. So I is out.

Option J: Cb ≡ Je – Again, C and J as predicates, but the original has S and E. So J(e) would mean something else, maybe.

So the best match is Option C: Sc ≡ Ej.

The correct translation is C: Sc ≡ Ej, as it accurately represents the biconditional relationship between Caroline being sweet and Janet being engaged to Brad.
