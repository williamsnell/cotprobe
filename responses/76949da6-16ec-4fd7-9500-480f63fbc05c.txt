Okay, so I've got this problem here about folding a piece of paper. Let me try to visualize it step by step. The paper is 8.5 by 11 inches, right? So, the longer side is 11 inches, and the shorter side is 8.5 inches.

The question says it's folded in half repeatedly, each time folding the longer side. So, the first fold would be along the longer side, which is 11 inches. When you fold it in half, you're essentially halving the longer side. So, 11 divided by 2 is 5.5 inches. Wait, but after folding, does the longer side become 8.5 inches or 5.5 inches? Hmm, no, wait. Because when you fold the longer side in half, the new dimensions would be 8.5 by 5.5. But then which is longer? Oh, because 8.5 is bigger than 5.5, so after the first fold, the longer side becomes 8.5 inches. Wait no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, when you fold the longer side, the longer side is being halved, so the new longer side would be the other dimension. Let me think again.

Original dimensions: 8.5 x 11 inches. The longer side is 11 inches. So when you fold it in half, you're bringing the two 11-inch sides together. So the new dimensions after the first fold would be 8.5 inches by (11/2) = 5.5 inches. So now, the longer side is 8.5 inches. Wait, because 8.5 is longer than 5.5. So after the first fold, the longer side is 8.5 inches.

Now, the second fold. We have to fold again, but this time, the longer side is 8.5 inches. So we fold that in half. So 8.5 divided by 2 is 4.25 inches. Now, after folding, the dimensions become 4.25 inches by 5.5 inches. Wait, no, because when you fold the longer side (8.5) in half, you're halving that dimension. So the new dimensions are 5.5 inches (the shorter side remains the same) and 4.25 inches (the folded longer side). So now, which is longer? 5.5 is longer than 4.25. So the longer side after the second fold is 5.5 inches.

Wait, but the question asks for the length of the longest side immediately after the second fold. So that would be 5.5 inches. Let me double-check.

First fold: 8.5 x 11 becomes 8.5 x 5.5 after folding the 11-inch side. So the longer side is 8.5.

Second fold: Now the longer side is 8.5, so we fold that in half. So the new dimensions are 4.25 x 5.5. The longer side here is 5.5 inches. So the answer should be 5.5 inches, which is option B.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the sides. Another way to think about it: each time, the longer side is folded in half, so after each fold, the longer side becomes the previous shorter side, but perhaps not always. Wait, in the first fold, longer side 11 becomes 5.5, and the shorter side 8.5 remains. So after first fold, the paper is 8.5 x 5.5, with longer side 8.5.

Second fold: longer side is 8.5, so folding it in half gives 4.25. The other side remains 5.5. So the new dimensions are 5.5 x 4.25, so longer side is 5.5. So yes, 5.5 is correct.

After the first fold, the longer side becomes 8.5 inches, and after the second fold, it becomes 5.5 inches.

Answer: B
