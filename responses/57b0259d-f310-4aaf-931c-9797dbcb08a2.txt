Okay, so I have this question about preventing SQL injection, and I need to figure out the correct answer from the options given. Let me start by recalling what I know about SQL injection and how to protect against it.

SQL injection is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker can manipulate a SQL query by injecting malicious code through user input. This can allow them to access or modify data they shouldn't have access to, which is a big security risk.

I remember that one of the main ways to prevent SQL injection is by using something called parameterized queries or prepared statements. These methods help to separate the user input from the actual SQL code, which makes it harder for attackers to inject their own commands. Another approach is to escape the user input, which means modifying the input so that any potentially harmful characters are rendered harmless.

Looking at the options provided:

A: Merge tables – I don't think merging tables has anything to do with preventing SQL injection. That sounds more like a database management task.

B: Escape queries – This seems relevant. By escaping the input, you can prevent certain characters from being interpreted as part of the SQL command.

C: Use a different programming language – Changing the language probably doesn't directly prevent SQL injection. It's more about how you handle the input regardless of the language.

D: Regularly restart the server – Restarting the server might help with other issues, but it doesn't prevent SQL injection.

E: Interrupt requests – I'm not sure how interrupting requests would help with SQL injection. It might affect performance but not security.

F: Use unfiltered user input directly in queries – This is actually a bad practice because using unfiltered input directly can allow SQL injection. So this option is incorrect as a prevention method.

G: Use antivirus software – Antivirus can protect against malware but doesn't specifically prevent SQL injection.

H: Use a stronger password for the database – While strong passwords are good for security, they don't prevent SQL injection, which is more about the structure of the queries.

I: Write all SQL queries in uppercase – This doesn't make a difference in terms of security; it's just about code readability.

J: All of the above – Well, if any of the above options are incorrect, then J would also be wrong.

So, the correct method is to escape the queries, which is option B. Other options either don't address SQL injection or are bad practices. Therefore, the answer should be B.

The correct method to prevent SQL injection is to escape the queries, which is option B.

Answer: B
