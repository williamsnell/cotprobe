Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the break-even point for four different scenarios. The break-even point is where the total cost equals the total revenue, right? That makes sense because at that point, the company isn't making a profit or a loss. 

The question has four parts, a to d, each with their own cost and revenue equations. I remember that the break-even point can be found by setting the cost equation equal to the revenue equation and solving for x, which represents the number of units. So, for each part, I need to solve C = R.

Let me start with part (a): C = $10x + $600 and R = $30x. So, I'll set them equal:

10x + 600 = 30x

Hmm, subtract 10x from both sides:

600 = 20x

Then, divide both sides by 20:

x = 600 / 20 = 30

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 30 as the first answer. Let me check again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate. 10x + 600 = 30x. Subtract 10x: 600 = 20x. So x = 30. Hmm, but none of the options have 30 as the first value except option I, which is 30 units, but let's see the other parts.

Wait, maybe I should go through each part one by one and see where I might have gone wrong.

Part (a): C = 10x + 600, R=30x. Break-even when 10x +600 = 30x → 20x=600 → x=30. So the first answer is 30 units. Looking at the options, option I starts with 30 units. So that's a possibility.

Now part (b): C =5x +200, R=8x. Setting equal: 5x +200 =8x → 200=3x → x=200/3 ≈66.666..., which is 66 and two-thirds units. So the second value should be 66 2/3 units.

Looking at the options, option I's second value is 66 2/3. That matches. So so far, option I has 30 and 66 2/3. Let me check part (c) to see if it aligns.

Part (c): C=0.2x +50, R=0.3x. Set equal: 0.2x +50 =0.3x → 50=0.1x → x=50/0.1=500. So the third value is 500 units. Option I's third value is 500, which matches.

Part (d): C=1800x +3000, R=2500x. Break-even: 1800x +3000=2500x → 3000=700x → x=3000/700. Let me compute that. 3000 ÷700 is the same as 300 ÷70, which simplifies to 30/7. 30 divided by 7 is approximately 4.2857, which is 4 and 2/7 units. So the last value is 4 2/7 units. Looking at option I, the last value is 4 2/7. So all four parts match option I.

Wait a second, but let me double-check part (d). Maybe I miscalculated. 1800x +3000 =2500x → 2500x -1800x = 3000 → 700x=3000 → x=3000/700. Dividing numerator and denominator by 100 gives 30/7, which is indeed 4 and 2/7. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but in the options, option I is: 30 units, 66 2/3 units, 500 units, 4 2/7 units. That's exactly what I calculated for each part a to d. So the correct answer should be option I, which is labeled as option I in the choices.
</think>

The break-even point is calculated by setting the cost equal to revenue for each scenario:

- **(a)** \(10x + 600 = 30x\) → \(x = 30\) units.
- **(b)** \(5x + 200 = 8x\) → \(x = 66 \frac{2}{3}\) units.
- **(c)** \(0.2x + 50 = 0.3x\) → \(x = 500\) units.
- **(d)** \(1800x + 3000 = 2500x\) → \(x = 4 \frac{2}{7}\) units.

These values match option I.
