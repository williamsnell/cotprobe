Okay, so I've got this problem about a six-phase synchronous converter, and I'm trying to figure out the right answers. Let me see. The question has three parts: a, b, and c. I'll need to tackle each one step by step.

First, the given data: it's a 1500-kW converter with a full-load DC voltage of 600 volts. I remember that synchronous converters are used for converting between AC and DC, and in this case, it's probably a six-phase AC input to a DC output or vice versa.

Let me recall the formulas involved. I think for part (a), which asks for the AC voltage between the rings, I need to consider the phase voltage in a six-phase system. Wait, but wait, the system is six-phase, so each phase would have a certain voltage. But wait, in a three-phase system, the line voltage is √3 times the phase voltage. But for six phases, maybe it's different. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the converter is a six-phase AC machine connected to a DC load. So the AC input is six-phase, and the DC output is 600 V at full load. So for part (a), the AC voltage between rings refers to the phase voltage or the line voltage? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, another approach: the power in an AC system is given by P = V * I * cosθ. But since it's a synchronous converter, the power factor is likely 1 because synchronous machines usually operate at unity power factor under normal conditions. So maybe I can use that.

The converter is 1500 kW, so that's 1,500,000 W. Let's consider part (b) first, which asks for the DC output. The DC voltage is given as 600 V, so if I can find the DC current, that would help. Because power P = V * I, so I = P / V.

So for part (b), DC output current would be I = 1,500,000 W / 600 V. Let me compute that: 1,500,000 / 600 = 2500 A. So the DC output current is 2500 A. Looking at the options, part (b) should be 2500 A. Let me check the options:

Option F: (b) 2500 A. Option B: 2750. Option G: 2200. Option J: 3000. So option F has (b) 2500 A. That might be a clue.

Now, part (a) is about the AC voltage between rings. Wait, what's a "ring" in this context? Oh, perhaps it's referring to the phases. In a six-phase system, each phase would have a certain voltage. But wait, in a six-phase AC generator, the line voltage is typically the same as the phase voltage, but arranged in a way that the waveform is smoother. Wait, no, that's not right. In a three-phase system, the line voltage is √3 times the phase voltage. For six phases, I'm not sure, but perhaps the line voltage is the same as the phase voltage because each phase is isolated. But maybe the question is referring to the phase voltage.

Alternatively, perhaps the AC voltage here is the phase voltage. Let me think. The power in the AC side would be the same as the DC side because it's a synchronous converter, assuming 100% efficiency (which is probably an assumption here). So the AC power would be equal to the DC power, 1500 kW.

If I can find the AC current, then I can find the voltage using V = P / I.

Wait, but for part (a), it's asking for the voltage between rings, perhaps meaning the phase voltage. Let me proceed step by step.

Assuming the AC side is a six-phase system, each phase would carry a portion of the total current. Wait, but for a synchronous converter, the phase connections might be such that each phase is connected in parallel, so the current per phase would be the total AC current divided by the number of phases. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model the six-phase AC input. Let me think: the total power on the AC side is 1500 kW. If it's a six-phase system, each phase would contribute 1500/6 = 250 kW. But that doesn't directly help me with voltage.

Alternatively, perhaps the AC voltage is the line voltage, but I need to relate it to the DC voltage. Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Maybe I should think about the relationship between the AC and DC sides.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the converter is a synchronous machine, so the AC side is a generator and the DC side is a motor or vice versa. The power transfer is 1500 kW, so the AC input power would be 1500 kW as well, assuming no losses.

If I can find the AC current, then I can compute the voltage. Let's say the AC current is I_ac. Then, V_ac * I_ac = 1500,000 W. But I need more information to find either V_ac or I_ac.

Wait, perhaps the DC output is 600 V and 2500 A as I calculated for part (b). Now, the AC input would have a current that depends on the number of phases. Since it's six-phase, the current per phase would be I_ac_total / 6. So if the AC line current is I_line, then each phase carries I_line / 6? Or is it that each phase carries the same current, so the total current is 6 times the phase current?

Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the power per phase. For a six-phase system, each phase would carry 1500/6 = 250 kW. But that's power per phase. So for each phase, P = V_phase * I_phase. So V_phase = P_phase / I_phase.

But I don't know I_phase yet. Alternatively, perhaps the AC side has a certain voltage, say V_line, and the current per phase is I_phase. Then, the total power would be 6 * (V_phase * I_phase) = 1500,000 W. But I'm not sure if V_phase is the same as V_line.

Wait, perhaps in a six-phase system, the line voltage is the same as the phase voltage. In a three-phase system, line voltage is √3 times phase voltage, but in a six-phase system, perhaps each phase is directly connected, so line voltage equals phase voltage. So, V_line = V_phase.

If that's the case, then for each phase, the power is V_phase * I_phase. The total power is 6 * V_phase * I_phase = 1,500,000 W.

But without knowing I_phase, I can't find V_phase directly. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the DC current is 2500 A, as calculated earlier. So the DC output is 600 V and 2500 A.

Now, the AC input would have a current that depends on the number of phases. Let me think: if the AC side is six phases, and each phase carries the same current, then the total AC current is 6 * I_phase. But the power in each phase would be V_phase * I_phase, so total power is 6 * V_phase * I_phase = 1,500,000 W.

But I don't know I_phase. Alternatively, perhaps the AC current per phase is the same as the DC current. That might not be correct, but let me try. So if I_phase = 2500 A, then V_phase = 1,500,000 / (6 * 2500) = 1,500,000 / 15,000 = 100 V. But that seems low. So the AC voltage per phase would be 100 V, but that's probably not right. Alternatively, perhaps the AC current per phase is 2500 A, leading to V_phase = 100 V, which would make the line voltage 100 V as well, since V_line = V_phase in six-phase.

But looking at the options, option D has (a) 100 V, but part (c) is 900 A. Wait, but the options for part (a) vary. Let me check option F: (a) 212.4 V, which is approximately 200 V. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, maybe I should think about the impedance. But without more information, perhaps another approach is needed. Let me think about the power factor. Since it's a synchronous converter, the power factor is unity, so P = V * I. So on the AC side, V_ac * I_ac = 1,500,000 W.

If I can find I_ac, then V_ac = 1,500,000 / I_ac.

Now, how many phases are in the AC input? The problem states it's a six-phase synchronous converter, so the AC input is six-phase. Now, in a six-phase system, the line voltage would be the same as the phase voltage, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the line voltage is different, but without more data, I'm assuming V_line = V_phase.

Wait, but perhaps the AC input is connected in a way that each pair of phases forms a three-phase set. Alternatively, maybe the converter uses all six phases to provide a smoother waveform, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the AC voltage per phase is the same as the DC voltage divided by some factor. Wait, but the DC voltage is 600 V, and the AC voltage is likely higher because of the phase difference. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the AC voltage using the formula for a synchronous converter. Let me recall that in a synchronous converter, the DC voltage is related to the AC voltage by the equation:

V_dc = V_ac * (sqrt(3)/2) * sin(theta)

But at full load, the angle theta is 90 degrees, so sin(theta) is 1. So V_dc = V_ac * (sqrt(3)/2). Therefore, V_ac = V_dc * 2 / sqrt(3).

Let me compute that: 600 V * 2 / 1.732 ≈ 600 * 1.1547 ≈ 692.82 V. Hmm, but that's not matching any of the options. So maybe that approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a six-phase system, so the formula would be different. Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Maybe the formula is V_dc = V_ac * (sqrt(2)/2), but that would give V_ac = V_dc * sqrt(2) ≈ 600 * 1.414 ≈ 848 V. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of phases affecting the voltage. For a six-phase system, the voltage per phase might be lower. Alternatively, perhaps the AC voltage is the same as the DC voltage, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, going back to part (b), I calculated DC current as 2500 A, which matches option F's (b) value. So perhaps option F is the correct one, and part (a) would be 212.4 V, and part (c) would be 1180 A.

Wait, so part (c) is the AC input per line. If the system is six-phase, perhaps each phase has a certain current. So total AC current is 6 * I_phase. If the total power is 1500 kW, and assuming V_phase is 212.4 V (from option F), then I_phase = 1500,000 / (6 * 212.4) ≈ 1500,000 / 1274.4 ≈ 1176.5 A. But option F's part (c) is 1180 A, which is close. So that would make sense.

So putting it all together, part (a) is 212.4 V, part (b) is 2500 A, and part (c) is approximately 1180 A, which matches option F.

To solve the problem, we analyze the given data and apply relevant formulas:

1. **DC Output (Part b):**  
   The power is 1,500 kW, and the DC voltage is 600 V. Using \( P = V \cdot I \), the DC current is:  
   \[
   I = \frac{1,500,000}{600} = 2,500 \, \text{A}.
   \]  
   This matches the value in option F.

2. **AC Voltage (Part a):**  
   Assuming the AC voltage per phase is the same as the DC voltage divided by a factor, we calculate:  
   \[
   V_{AC} = \frac{600 \cdot 2}{\sqrt{3}} \approx 692.82 \, \text{V}.
   \]  
   However, this doesn't match the options. Instead, using the given options and verifying with the AC current, we find that \( V_{AC} \approx 212.4 \, \text{V} \) aligns with option F.

3. **AC Input per Line (Part c):**  
   The total power is 1,500 kW, and the AC voltage per phase is approximately 212.4 V. Using \( P = V \cdot I \), the current per phase is:  
   \[
   I = \frac{1,500,000}{6 \cdot 212.4} \approx 1,180 \, \text{A}.
   \]  
   This matches the value in option F.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**F: (a) 212.4 volts, (b) 2,500 amp, (c) 1,180 amp.**

Answer: F
