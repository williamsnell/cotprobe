Okay, so I'm trying to figure out who the first First Lady was to run for political office. The options given are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I should recall who each of these women are and their political careers. Starting with the earliest ones might help because I know that First Ladies have been around since the beginning of the United States, but their political involvement has varied over time.

Option A is Betty Ford. I remember she was the wife of Gerald Ford, who was President in the 1970s. She was quite active in women's rights and even ran for Congress after her husband left office. I think she was the first to run for a political position after being First Lady, but I'm not sure if she was the first overall.

Option B is Laura Bush, the wife of George W. Bush. She was active in education and literacy, especially after 9/11. I don't recall her running for office, but she was very supportive of her husband's policies.

Option C is Rosalynn Carter, wife of Jimmy Carter. She was known for her work in mental health. I don't think she ran for office either, but she was quite active in her husband's campaigns.

Option D is Jacqueline Kennedy, the wife of John F. Kennedy. She was very young and glamorous, but I don't think she ran for office after her husband was assassinated. She later remarried, but I don't remember her entering politics.

Option E is Barbara Bush, wife of George H.W. Bush. She was very supportive of her husband's political career and wrote books, but I don't think she ran for office herself.

Option F is Eleanor Roosevelt, the wife of Franklin D. Roosevelt. She was a very influential First Lady, involved in politics and even served as a delegate to the United Nations. However, I think she didn't run for office herself because she was part of the Roosevelt administration but not a candidate.

Option G is Nancy Reagan, wife of Ronald Reagan. She was active in the fight against drugs and supported her husband's policies, but I don't think she ran for office.

Option H is Bess Truman, wife of Harry Truman. She was quite reserved and didn't take an active role in politics, as far as I know.

Option I is Hillary Clinton, wife of Bill Clinton. She ran for the Senate, then for President, so she's definitely a First Lady who ran for office. But was she the first?

Option J is Michelle Obama, wife of Barack Obama. She was very involved in her husband's campaigns and has been active in her own initiatives, but I don't think she ran for office herself.

So, putting this together, the first First Lady to run for political office would be Betty Ford because she ran for Congress after her husband's presidency. Eleanor Roosevelt was very politically active, but I don't think she ran for office herself. Hillary Clinton is more recent, so she can't be the first. Therefore, the answer should be A: Betty Ford.
