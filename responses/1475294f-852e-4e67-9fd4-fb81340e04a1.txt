The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A state built a casino and issued bonds to finance its construction. On five occasions, there were episodes of violence in various casinos in the state. The state police attributed the violence to greed and fear at the casinos. To prevent such violence, the state legislature passes a statute prohibiting all gambling at privately owned casinos in the state. Is this law likely to be held constitutional if most casinos in the state were owned by those from out-of-state?

Options:

A: Yes, because the act was expressly authorized by the state legislature.
B: No, because the state does not have the authority to regulate commerce.
C: No, because this would infringe on the rights of out-of-state business owners.
D: Yes, but only if the casinos were given notice and an opportunity to be heard before the law was passed.
E: Yes, but only if the local interest in safety outweighs the burden of interstate commerce.
F: No, because the statute violates the due process rights of the owners of the casinos.
G: Yes, but only if the state can prove that the violence was directly caused by the casinos.
H: No, because out-of-state casinos are part of interstate commerce.
I: No, because the state cannot interfere with private businesses.
J: Yes, because the state has the power to regulate businesses within its borders.

Okay, so I have this constitutional law question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about whether a state law prohibiting gambling at privately owned casinos is constitutional, especially when most of these casinos are owned by out-of-state businesses. The state built their own casino using bonds and had some episodes of violence, which the police linked to greed and fear at the casinos. To prevent this violence, the legislature passed a law banning all gambling at privately owned casinos. Now, the issue is whether this law is constitutional if most casinos are out-of-state owned.

Hmm, so the key here is likely the Commerce Clause. The Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce, and states have some authority as well, but there are limits. The question is whether the state's law is infringing on interstate commerce.

States can regulate commerce within their borders, but they can't discriminate against out-of-state businesses or unduly burden interstate commerce. So if the law is targeting out-of-state casinos more than in-state ones, that could be a problem.

Wait, the state's own casino isn't affected by the ban, right? Because the law prohibits gambling at privately owned casinos, not the state-run one. So the state is allowing its own casino but banning private ones, which are mostly out-of-state. That sounds like it might be discriminatory against out-of-state businesses, which could be unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause.

Looking at the options:

Option A says yes because the legislature authorized it. But that doesn't address the Commerce Clause issue, so probably not right.

Option B says no because the state can't regulate commerce. I'm not sure because states do regulate commerce, but maybe if it's affecting interstate commerce too much.

Option C says no because it infringes on out-of-state business rights. That sounds plausible because if the law targets out-of-state businesses, it might be unconstitutional.

Option E says yes only if local interest outweighs interstate commerce. That's a possible outcome under a balancing test, but I think the initial analysis is whether the law is discriminatory. If it's just a general ban, maybe it's okay, but if it's targeting out-of-state owners, that's a problem.

Option H says no because out-of-state casinos are part of interstate commerce. That makes sense because if the casinos are owned out-of-state, their operations are part of interstate commerce, and states can't unduly burden that.

Option I says no because the state can't interfere with private businesses. That's a broad statement, but the real issue is whether the interference is constitutional under the Commerce Clause.

So, the main issue is whether the state law is discriminatory or unduly burdens interstate commerce. If the state is banning private casinos, which are mostly out-of-state owned, that might be seen as discriminating against interstate commerce. So the law would likely be unconstitutional because it's interfering with interstate commerce, which is a federal matter.

Looking at the options again, option H says no because out-of-state casinos are part of interstate commerce. That seems correct. Alternatively, option C is about infringing on business rights, but the Commerce Clause is more about the state's authority over interstate commerce.

So the correct answer is either H or C. But I think H is more precise because it's about the nature of the commerce involved.

The question revolves around whether a state law banning gambling at privately owned casinos, which are mostly out-of-state, is constitutional. The key issue is the Commerce Clause, which prohibits states from unduly burdening or discriminating against interstate commerce. Since the casinos are likely part of interstate commerce and the law targets private, out-of-state businesses, the law likely violates the Commerce Clause. 

The correct answer is H: No, because out-of-state casinos are part of interstate commerce.
