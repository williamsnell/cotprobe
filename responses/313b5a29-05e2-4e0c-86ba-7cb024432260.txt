Okay, so I need to figure out what Hobbes defines as injustice. I remember that Thomas Hobbes wrote a lot about the state of nature and the social contract. Let me think. Hobbes believed that in the state of nature, people's lives are "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." He thought that people are naturally self-interested and that without a sovereign power, society would fall into chaos because everyone would act in their own self-interest without regard for others.

So, Hobbes's philosophy revolves around the idea that a social contract is necessary to establish order. People agree to give up some of their freedoms to a sovereign in exchange for protection and order. The key here is the idea of justice and injustice as defined by Hobbes.

Looking at the options, I need to choose which one aligns with his views. Let's go through each option:

A: failure to abide by a contract. Hmm, contracts are important in social contract theory, but is that what defines justice? I think it's more about the laws set by the sovereign rather than just contracts.

B: disregard for societal norms. Hobbes does talk about societal order, but I'm not sure if he defines injustice as simply disregarding norms.

C: acting against the welfare of others. That sounds a bit like the idea of not considering others, but I'm not certain if that's Hobbes's definition.

D: disobedience to parental authority. That seems more like a specific type of authority, and Hobbes talks about the sovereign, not just parents.

E: disobedience to God's law. Hobbes was an atheist, if I recall correctly, so this might not be the right choice.

F: acting against one's own self-interest. Wait, Hobbes says people act in self-interest, so acting against it doesn't sound right. Injustice isn't about going against oneself.

G: failure to follow the rule of law. Oh, this seems plausible. Hobbes emphasizes the laws set by the sovereign. If people don't follow those laws, that's injustice.

H: failure to respect inherent rights. I'm not sure. Hobbes might not have believed in natural rights in the way we think of them today.

I: failure to uphold moral duties. Hobbes might not focus on moral duties as much as on the laws and the social contract.

J: disobedience to a sovereign. This also seems relevant because Hobbes's entire framework is about the authority of the sovereign. Disobeying the sovereign would definitely be considered unjust because it disrupts the social order.

Wait, so both G and J seem possible. Let me think again. Hobbes's definition of justice is tied to the laws of the sovereign. In Leviathan, he says that the laws are the commands of the sovereign, and justice is about following those commands. So, injustice would be failing to follow the rule of law, which is G. But J is about disobeying the sovereign directly.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is J because the definition is about the sovereign's authority. Because without obeying the sovereign, the state breaks down, leading to the state of war. So, Hobbes defines justice as compliance with the sovereign's laws, and injustice as the failure to do so, which is J.

Wait, but I also thought G was about the rule of law. So, if the rule of law is the sovereign's law, then G and J are connected. Hmm. Maybe the question is about the specific term Hobbes uses. I think Hobbes defines justice as the execution of the law, so the failure to follow the rule of law (G) might be the answer. But I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is H: failure to respect inherent rights. But Hobbes doesn't really talk about inherent rights; he's more about the rights given by the sovereign. Or perhaps E, but that's about God. No, E is less likely.

Wait, I think I remember that Hobbes emphasizes the laws of the sovereign as the basis for justice. So, if someone doesn't follow those laws, that's injustice. So, G: failure to follow the rule of law. Or J: disobedience to a sovereign.

Wait, the options are a bit different. G is about the rule of law, which is the system, while J is about the sovereign's commands. So, perhaps J is the better answer because Hobbes's view is that the sovereign's authority is absolute. Therefore, not obeying the sovereign is the definition of injustice.

But I'm a bit torn. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is J. Because in Hobbes's view, the sovereign's laws are the basis of justice. So, failing to respect them would be injustice.

According to Hobbes, the definition of injustice is best captured by the idea of failing to follow the rule of law established by the sovereign. Hobbes emphasizes the importance of the sovereign's authority in maintaining social order and justice. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**G: failure to follow the rule of law**

**Answer: G**
