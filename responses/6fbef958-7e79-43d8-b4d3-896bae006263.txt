Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a sphere rolling down a hill. The question is asking which force provides the torque that causes the sphere to rotate. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

Alright, the sphere starts from rest on a hill that's inclined at a constant angle. It rolls without slipping, which I remember means there's no relative motion between the point of contact and the surface. So, it's rolling smoothly without any sliding.

I need to figure out what's causing the torque. Torque is the rotational equivalent of force, right? It's the force that causes rotation around an axis. For the sphere to start rotating as it rolls down, there must be a torque acting on it.

Let me go through the options one by one:

A: Magnetic force. Well, the problem doesn't mention any magnets or magnetic fields, so I can probably rule this out. No reason to think magnetic force is involved here.

B: Static friction. Static friction is the force that prevents objects from sliding when they're in contact. Since the sphere is rolling without slipping, static friction must be at play. I remember that static friction provides the necessary torque for rolling without slipping. Because without friction, the sphere might just slide down without rotating.

C: Tension force. Tension is usually associated with strings or ropes pulling objects. There's no mention of any string or pulley system here, so tension doesn't seem relevant. Probably not C.

D: The inertia of the sphere. Inertia is the resistance to change in motion, but it's not a force. So D isn't a force causing torque. Plus, inertia is more about whether the sphere continues moving once it's going.

E: The normal force of the hill on the sphere. The normal force is perpendicular to the surface. Torque is force times the lever arm, and if the force is perpendicular, the lever arm would be zero because it's along the axis of rotation. So normal force doesn't contribute to torque. E is out.

F: Gravity. Gravity acts downward, pulling the sphere towards the center of the Earth. The component of gravity along the incline is what causes the sphere to accelerate down the hill. But how does gravity cause rotation? Well, for rotation, the torque is the force times the perpendicular distance from the axis. The gravitational force acts at the center of mass, so the torque would be due to the component of gravity acting tangentially. Wait, but does gravity directly provide the torque, or is it the friction that translates that into rotation? Because without friction, gravity would just cause linear acceleration, not rotation. So maybe the torque comes from the point where the sphere contacts the hill. Wait, but the torque is due to the force that causes rotation around the contact point. So if the sphere is rolling without slipping, the point of contact is instantaneously at rest relative to the hill. The torque that causes rotation must come from a force that acts at that point but not necessarily directly from the contact. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again.

Wait, static friction is the force that provides the torque. Because the sphere's lower part tends to slide down due to gravity, and static friction opposes that sliding motion by applying a force upwards along the incline at the point of contact. This static friction force acts tangential to the sphere at the contact point, providing the necessary torque to make it rotate. So without static friction, the sphere wouldn't roll; it would just slide. So the torque comes from static friction.

G: Centrifugal force. That's a pseudo-force experienced in rotating frames of reference. But here, we're dealing with a sphere starting from rest and beginning to roll, so it's not in circular motion yet. So G is probably not relevant.

H: The net force of the sphere. Net force is the vector sum of all forces, which would be down the incline. But torque is caused by individual forces, not the net force itself. So H isn't correct.

I: Kinetic friction. Kinetic friction acts when there's relative motion. Since the sphere is rolling without slipping, it's static friction, not kinetic. So I is out.

J: The force of friction between the sphere and the air. Air resistance opposes motion, but in this case, the sphere is rolling down, and the torque is more about the contact with the hill, not the air. Plus, air resistance usually affects linear motion more than rotational unless it's significant, which it's not in this scenario.

So putting it all together, the force that provides the torque is static friction because it's the force that causes the sphere to rotate as it rolls down without slipping. Without static friction, the sphere wouldn't rotate; it would just slide.

The torque that causes the sphere to rotate as it rolls down the hill is provided by static friction. Static friction opposes the relative motion between the sphere and the hill, enabling the sphere to roll without slipping. This frictional force acts at the point of contact and provides the necessary rotational force (torque) to initiate and sustain the sphere's rotation.

Answer: B
