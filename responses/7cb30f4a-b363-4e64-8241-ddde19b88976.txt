Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question is about a hypothesis test for a population mean. It's a one-sided test, using a sample size of 14. The P-value they got is 0.075, and I need to find which range of t-values would correspond to this P-value. There are ten options labeled A through J.

Hmm, right, so I'm dealing with a t-test here because the sample size is small (n=14), which means we use the t-distribution instead of the z-distribution. Since it's a one-sided test, the P-value is the area under the t-distribution curve in one tail.

The P-value is 0.075, which is 7.5%. So, I think I need to find the critical t-value that corresponds to a cumulative probability of 0.925 (since 1 - 0.075 = 0.925) in a one-tailed test. Wait, no, actually, P-value is the probability in the tail, so for a one-tailed test, the critical value would be where the cumulative probability is 1 - 0.075 = 0.925. Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The P-value is the probability beyond the t-statistic. So for a one-tailed test, if the P-value is 0.075, that means the t-statistic is at the point where 7.5% of the distribution is beyond it.

So I need to find the t-value such that the area to the right of it is 0.075. Alternatively, the cumulative area up to that t-value is 0.925. But wait, since it's a one-tailed test, I think I should be using the upper tail. So, the t-value would be the point where the cumulative probability is 0.925. But wait, actually, in some tables, people look for the lower tail. So, maybe I should think about it as the t-value where the cumulative probability is 0.075, but that would be in the lower tail. No, wait, no, because in an upper-tailed test, the P-value is the area beyond the t-statistic, so the t-value is the point where the area to its right is 0.075. So, the cumulative probability up to that t-value is 1 - 0.075 = 0.925.

Wait, but sometimes I get confused. Let me think: in a one-tailed upper test, if the t-statistic is positive and the P-value is the area to the right, then yes, the cumulative area up to t is 0.925. So I need to find the t-value where the cumulative probability is 0.925 with 13 degrees of freedom (since degrees of freedom is n-1, which is 14-1=13).

I don't remember all the t-values off the top of my head, but I can try to think about common critical values. For example, for a 90% confidence interval (which would correspond to a two-tailed test with alpha=0.10), the critical t-value for 13 degrees of freedom is around 1.771. Wait, but that's for a two-tailed test, right? Because 90% confidence leaves 5% in each tail. So, the critical t-value for the upper tail at 0.05 significance level would be around 1.771. But wait, that's for a two-tailed test, each tail having 0.025.

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct myself. For a two-tailed test with alpha=0.10, each tail has 0.05. The critical t-value for df=13 and upper tail probability 0.05 is around 1.771. So, if someone has a t-statistic greater than 1.771, the P-value would be less than 0.05.

But in our case, the P-value is 0.075, which is higher than 0.05. So the t-statistic must be between the critical values for 0.05 and 0.10 in the upper tail. Because as the t-value increases, the P-value decreases. So, if the P-value is 0.075, the t-statistic must be between the 0.05 and 0.10 critical values.

Wait, let me think again. The P-value is 0.075, which is the area beyond t. So, if I'm looking for the t-value where P(t > t0) = 0.075, then t0 is the value such that the area to the right is 0.075. So, the cumulative area up to t0 is 0.925.

I think I should look up the t-table for df=13 and find the value where the cumulative probability is 0.925. Alternatively, I can use an online calculator or remember approximate values.

From what I recall, the t-critical values for df=13 are as follows:

- For 0.10 significance (two-tailed), the critical t is about 1.771. Wait, no, that's for 0.05 in each tail. Wait, no, wait: two-tailed alpha=0.10 means each tail has alpha/2=0.05. So the critical t-value at 0.05 upper tail is around 1.771.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of it this way: for a one-tailed test at alpha=0.10, the critical t-value is the point where the area to the right is 0.10. So, the cumulative area up to t is 0.90. For df=13, I think the t-value around 1.345 corresponds to a cumulative probability of 0.90. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up the values.

Let me think again. For df=13, the critical t-values for common significance levels are:

- 90% confidence (two-tailed, alpha=0.10): t ≈ 1.771
- 95% confidence (two-tailed, alpha=0.05): t ≈ 2.160
- 99% confidence (two-tailed, alpha=0.01): t ≈ 2.650

Wait, no, wait. For a two-tailed test with alpha=0.10, each tail has 0.05. So the critical t-value is the point where the area beyond it is 0.05, which is 1.771 for df=13.

So, if the P-value is 0.075, which is higher than 0.05, the t-statistic must be between 1.771 and 2.160 because 2.160 is the critical value for alpha=0.025 (two-tailed), which corresponds to a P-value of 0.025 in each tail.

Wait, no. Wait, let me clarify. For a one-tailed test, the critical value for alpha=0.10 is the t-value where the area to the right is 0.10. So, the cumulative area up to that t is 0.90. For df=13, I think that t is around 1.345. Because I remember that for df=12, the 0.90 cumulative probability is about 1.356, and for df=13, it's a bit lower, maybe around 1.345.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting memories. Let me try to reconstruct: the t-table for df=13, one-tailed.

Looking for the t-value where the cumulative probability is 0.90 (so area to the right is 0.10). I think that's around 1.345. Similarly, for cumulative probability 0.925 (area to the right is 0.075), the t-value would be higher than 1.345 but lower than the next critical value.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about it differently. The P-value is 0.075, which is between 0.05 and 0.10. So the t-statistic must be between the critical values that correspond to these alphas.

For a one-tailed test:

- At alpha=0.10, t-critical ≈ 1.345 (so area beyond is 0.10)
- At alpha=0.05, t-critical ≈ 1.771 (area beyond is 0.05)
- At alpha=0.025, t-critical ≈ 2.160 (area beyond is 0.025)

Wait, no, that can't be right because 2.160 is for a two-tailed test with alpha=0.05 (each tail 0.025). So for a one-tailed test with alpha=0.025, t-critical is around 2.160.

But in our case, the P-value is 0.075, which is between 0.05 and 0.10. So the t-statistic must be between the critical values that correspond to these alphas. So, for a one-tailed test, alpha=0.05 corresponds to t=1.771, and alpha=0.10 corresponds to t=1.345. So if the P-value is 0.075, which is between 0.05 and 0.10, the t-statistic must be between 1.345 and 1.771.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because a higher t-statistic would give a lower P-value. So if the P-value is 0.075, which is higher than 0.05 but lower than 0.10, the t-statistic must be between the critical values for alpha=0.10 (t=1.345) and alpha=0.05 (t=1.771). Because as t increases, the P-value decreases.

Wait, but earlier I thought that for a P-value of 0.075, the t-statistic would be between 1.771 and 2.160. That was a mistake because I was confusing one-tailed and two-tailed.

Wait, let me clarify. The P-value is 0.075 in a one-tailed test. So, the t-statistic must be such that the area beyond it is 0.075. So, the cumulative area up to t is 1 - 0.075 = 0.925.

Looking up a t-table for df=13, the cumulative probability of 0.925 would correspond to a t-value higher than the 0.90 cumulative, which is 1.345, and lower than the 0.95 cumulative, which is 1.771. Wait, no, because 0.925 is between 0.90 and 0.95.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused again. Let me think: the cumulative probability increases as t increases. So, for df=13:

- t=1.345: cumulative area ≈ 0.90
- t=1.771: cumulative area ≈ 0.95
- t=2.160: cumulative area ≈ 0.975

Wait, no, I think that's incorrect. Let me correct: for df=13, the t-values and their cumulative probabilities are as follows:

- t=1.345: cumulative area ≈ 0.90 (so area beyond is 0.10)
- t=1.771: cumulative area ≈ 0.95 (area beyond is 0.05)
- t=2.160: cumulative area ≈ 0.975 (area beyond is 0.025)

Wait, that makes more sense. So, if the cumulative area is 0.90 at t=1.345, then at t=1.771, it's 0.95, and at t=2.160, it's 0.975.

So, if the cumulative area is 0.925, which is between 0.90 and 0.95, the t-value must be between 1.345 and 1.771.

Wait, but that can't be right because 0.925 is between 0.90 and 0.95, so the t-value would be between 1.345 and 1.771. But wait, the P-value is 0.075, which is the area beyond t, so the cumulative area up to t is 0.925. So, t must be between the values where cumulative is 0.90 and 0.95, which are 1.345 and 1.771.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option F is 1.350 < t < 1.771, which would fit this range. But wait, let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: 1.000 < t< 1.500
B: 1.500 < t< 2.000
C: 1.771 < t< 2.160
D: 1.771 < t< 2.500
E: 1.782 < t< 2.150
F: 1.350 < t< 1.771
G: 1.345 < t< 1.761
H: 1.761 < t< 2.160
I: 1.356 < t< 1.782
J: 1.200 < t< 1.400

So, option F is 1.350 to 1.771, which aligns with the t-values between 1.345 and 1.771 that I thought of. But wait, I'm not sure because I might have mixed up the cumulative probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Another way to think about it is that the P-value is 0.075, which is 7.5%, so we're looking for the t-value where the area beyond it is 7.5%. That would correspond to a t-value between the 0.05 and 0.10 critical values in the one-tailed test.

Wait, but wait, for a one-tailed test, the critical value at alpha=0.10 is t=1.345 (area beyond is 0.10), and at alpha=0.05, it's t=1.771 (area beyond is 0.05). So, if the P-value is 0.075, which is between 0.05 and 0.10, the t-statistic must be between 1.345 and 1.771.

Therefore, the correct range is between approximately 1.345 and 1.771. Looking at the options, option F is 1.350 < t < 1.771, which is very close. Option G is 1.345 < t <1.761, which also includes the lower end. Hmm.

Wait, but I think I need to be more precise. Let me try to recall or reconstruct the t-values for df=13.

From what I remember, the t-critical values for df=13 are approximately:

- For 0.10 cumulative probability (upper tail 0.90): t ≈ 1.345
- For 0.90 cumulative probability (upper tail 0.10): t ≈ 1.345? No, wait, that can't be. Wait, no, the cumulative probability is the area to the left. So, for the upper tail probability of 0.10, the cumulative area to the left is 0.90, which is t≈1.345.

Similarly, for the upper tail probability of 0.05, the cumulative area is 0.95, which is t≈1.771.

So, if the P-value is 0.075 (upper tail), the cumulative area is 0.925. So, the t-value would be between the t-values corresponding to 0.90 and 0.95 cumulative probabilities. So, between 1.345 and 1.771.

Looking at the options, option F is 1.350 < t < 1.771, which is very close. Option G is 1.345 < t <1.761, which is a bit lower on the upper end.

Wait, but I think the exact t-value for cumulative probability 0.925 with df=13 is approximately 1.761. Because I remember that for df=12, the 0.925 cumulative is around 1.782, and for df=13, it's slightly lower, maybe around 1.761.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe I'm confusing the one-tailed and two-tailed. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a t-table.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use an approximate approach. Let me think about the t-distribution for df=13.

The t-values and their approximate areas:

- t=1.345: area beyond is 0.10 (cumulative 0.90)
- t=1.771: area beyond is 0.05 (cumulative 0.95)
- t=2.160: area beyond is 0.025 (cumulative 0.975)

So, for a P-value of 0.075, which is between 0.05 and 0.10, the t-statistic must be between 1.345 and 1.771.

Looking at the options, option F is 1.350 < t <1.771, which fits this range.

But wait, I'm seeing that option H is 1.761 < t <2.160, which is higher than the 1.771 I was considering. So that can't be right because 1.771 is the critical value for 0.05, so a t-value higher than that would give a P-value lower than 0.05, which isn't the case here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again: the P-value is 0.075, so the area beyond t is 0.075. So, the cumulative area up to t is 0.925. So, we're looking for the t-value where the cumulative area is 0.925, which is between the t-values for 0.90 and 0.95.

So, t=1.345 for cumulative 0.90, t=1.771 for cumulative 0.95. Therefore, the t-statistic would be between these two values.

Looking at the options, option F is 1.350 < t <1.771, which matches this range.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because another part of me thinks that for a P-value of 0.075 in a one-tailed test, the t-statistic would be between the critical values for alpha=0.10 and alpha=0.05, which are 1.345 and 1.771, respectively. So, the t-statistic would be between 1.345 and 1.771, making the correct option F.

But wait, I'm also seeing option H as 1.761 < t <2.160. Wait, 1.761 is close to 1.771, so perhaps that's the same range? No, because 1.761 is lower than 1.771, so it's within the previous range.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to find the exact t-value for cumulative probability 0.925 with df=13.

I think the t-value for df=13 and cumulative probability 0.925 is approximately 1.761. Because for df=12, it's about 1.782, and as degrees of freedom increase, the t-value decreases slightly. So for df=13, it's around 1.761.

So, the t-value where the cumulative area is 0.925 is approximately 1.761, meaning the area beyond it (P-value) is 0.075.

Wait, but no, wait. If the cumulative area is 0.925, the area beyond is 0.075. So, the t-value is the point where cumulative area is 0.925, which is higher than the t-value for 0.90 (1.345) and lower than the t-value for 0.95 (1.771). So, the t-value is between 1.345 and 1.771.

Wait, but if the exact t-value for 0.925 is 1.761, then the t-statistic would be around 1.761, which is just below 1.771. So, the range would be from 1.345 up to 1.761, which is option G: 1.345 < t <1.761.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me try to think of it numerically. If the P-value is 0.075, then the t-statistic is such that P(t > t0) = 0.075. So, t0 is the value where the cumulative distribution function (CDF) is 0.925. So, t0 = t.inv(0.925, 13). Using a calculator or table, I think t0 is approximately 1.761.

So, the t-statistic is around 1.761. But the question is asking for the range that would give this P-value. Since the P-value is exactly 0.075, the t-statistic is exactly 1.761. But the options are ranges, so the correct range would include 1.761.

Looking at the options, option H is 1.761 < t <2.160, which starts just above 1.761. But wait, if t is exactly 1.761, then it's not included in option H, which is greater than 1.761. So, that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are looking for the range that includes t=1.761, so the lower bound would be the previous critical value.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again: the P-value is 0.075, which is between 0.05 and 0.10. So, the t-statistic is between the critical values for alpha=0.10 and alpha=0.05. Those critical values are 1.345 and 1.771, respectively. So, the t-statistic is between 1.345 and 1.771.

Looking at the options, option F is 1.350 < t <1.771, which is very close. Option G is 1.345 < t <1.761, which is a bit more precise on the lower end but ends before 1.771.

Wait, but I think the exact t-value for 0.925 is 1.761, so the t-statistic would be just below 1.771. So, the correct range would be from 1.345 up to 1.761, which is option G.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the answer options again.

Option F: 1.350 < t <1.771

Option G: 1.345 < t <1.761

Option H: 1.761 < t <2.160

So, if the t-statistic is around 1.761, which is the value where P(t > t0)=0.075, then the range that includes this value would be from just below 1.761 to higher. But since the options are ranges, I think the correct range is option F because it includes up to 1.771, which is the critical value for alpha=0.05. However, since the exact t-value is around 1.761, which is just below 1.771, the range should be up to 1.761, making option G the correct choice.

Wait, but option G is 1.345 < t <1.761, which would include t=1.761 as the upper limit. But in the options, it's stated as less than 1.761, so does that include 1.761? Or is it strictly less than?

In the options, it's written as "1.345 < t <1.761", meaning t is greater than 1.345 and less than 1.761. So, if the exact t-value is 1.761, it's not included in option G. Therefore, perhaps option F is the correct one because it goes up to 1.771, which is the critical value for alpha=0.05, and the t-statistic of 1.761 falls within that range.

Wait, but 1.761 is less than 1.771, so it would be included in option F. So, the correct range is 1.350 < t <1.771, which is option F.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to summarize:

- P-value = 0.075 (one-tailed)
- df=13
- t-critical for alpha=0.10 (P=0.10) is t=1.345
- t-critical for alpha=0.05 (P=0.05) is t=1.771
- Therefore, t-statistic is between 1.345 and 1.771
- The options that fit this range are F (1.350 < t <1.771) and G (1.345 < t <1.761)
- The exact t-value for P=0.075 is around 1.761, which is within option F's upper bound of 1.771 and above option G's upper bound of 1.761.

Wait, but 1.761 is less than 1.771, so it's included in option F's range. Therefore, the correct answer should be option F: 1.350 < t <1.771.

But I'm still a bit uncertain because I thought the exact t-value was around 1.761, which is very close to 1.771. Maybe the options are approximations, and option F is the best fit.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the possible t-values for a P-value of 0.075. Since 0.075 is between 0.05 and 0.10, the t-statistic must be between the corresponding critical values, which are 1.345 and 1.771. Therefore, the correct range is option F: 1.350 < t <1.771.
</think>

The question involves determining the range of t-values that correspond to a P-value of 0.075 in a one-sided hypothesis test about a population mean, based on a sample of size 14. Since the sample size is small (n=14), the t-distribution with 13 degrees of freedom (df=13) is used. The P-value of 0.075 indicates that the area to the right of the t-statistic is 0.075, meaning the cumulative area up to the t-statistic is 0.925.

To find the t-values, we compare the P-value to common critical values for df=13:
- For a one-tailed test with α=0.10, the critical t-value is approximately 1.345 (cumulative area=0.90).
- For a one-tailed test with α=0.05, the critical t-value is approximately 1.771 (cumulative area=0.95).

Since the P-value of 0.075 is between 0.05 and 0.10, the t-statistic must fall between the critical values of 1.345 and 1.771. Among the options provided, the range that best fits this interval is **1.350 < t < 1.771**.

Answer: F
