Okay, so I have this question about calculating the discount rate for a loan. Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on here.

Mr. White received $972.50 from ABC Loan Company. He signed a loan agreement to pay back $1000 at the end of 180 days. So, the loan company is giving him $972.50 now, and he has to pay back $1000 after 180 days. I think this is a discount loan because the interest is deducted upfront, right?

Wait, no, actually, in a discount loan, the interest is subtracted from the principal before the borrower receives the money. But in this case, Mr. White is receiving $972.50 and has to pay back $1000. So maybe it's more like a simple interest loan where the interest is calculated on the principal, and he pays back the principal plus interest after the term.

So, the formula for simple interest is I = P * r * t, where I is the interest, P is the principal, r is the rate, and t is the time in years.

Wait, but here, the amount he receives is the principal minus the interest. Or is it the other way around? Let me think. If he gets $972.50 and has to pay back $1000, then the interest is $1000 - $972.50 = $27.50. So the interest is $27.50 over 180 days.

So, the principal here is $972.50, because that's what he actually receives. Or is the principal $1000? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Wait, no, in a discount loan, the borrower receives the principal minus the interest. So the principal is $1000, and the interest is $27.50, so he gets $972.50.

So, using the simple interest formula: I = P * r * t. Here, I is $27.50, P is $1000, r is the annual rate we're trying to find, and t is 180 days, which is 0.5 years.

Plugging in the numbers: 27.50 = 1000 * r * 0.5.

So, 27.50 = 500 * r.

Then, r = 27.50 / 500 = 0.055, which is 5.5% per year.

Looking at the options, option C is 5.5% per year. So that should be the answer.

The discount rate is calculated using the simple interest formula, where the interest is $27.50, the principal is $1000, and the time is 180 days (0.5 years). Solving for r gives 5.5% per year.

Answer: C
