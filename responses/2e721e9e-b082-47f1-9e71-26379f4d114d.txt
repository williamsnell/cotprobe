Question:

Although all electrons spin, only molecules containing unpairedelectrons - only free radicals - giveesrspectra. Why is this? (Hint: Consider the possibility (a)thatone electron of a pair has its spin reversed, or (b)thatboth electrons of a pair have their spins reversed.)

Options:

A: Electron pairs have a net magnetic moment
B: Only electrons in the outermost shell contribute to the magnetic moment, regardless of pairing
C: Each electron of a pair has a unique magnetic moment
D: Free radicals lack electron pairs, which is why they cannot generate a magnetic moment
E: Electron pairs always spin in the same direction, enhancing the magnetic moment
F: Electron pairs generate a magnetic moment of the same magnitude
G: Electron pairs have spins that cancel only in the presence of an external magnetic field
H: Each electron of an electron pair generates a magnetic moment but of equal and opposite magnitude; the electron pair therefore has no net magnetic moment.
I: Electron pairs generate magnetic moments only at high temperatures
J: The magnetic moments of electron pairs reinforce each other, resulting in a double magnetic moment

Okay, so I've got this question about why only molecules with unpaired electrons, like free radicals, give certain spectra. Hmm, I remember from my chemistry classes that this has to do with electron spin and magnetic properties. Let me think through this step by step.

The question gives a hint: either one electron in a pair has its spin reversed (option a) or both do (option b). I think when electrons are paired, their spins are opposite. So each pair would have a certain magnetic effect.

Wait, magnetic moments come from the spin of electrons. If two electrons are paired, their spins are opposite, right? So their magnetic moments would cancel each other out. But if there's an unpaired electron, its magnetic moment doesn't get canceled. That makes sense because only free radicals have unpaired electrons.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. 

Option A says electron pairs have a net magnetic moment. But if their spins are opposite, their moments would cancel, so net moment would be zero. So A might be wrong.

Option B talks about outermost electrons, but I don't think that's related to pairing. The question is about whether electrons are paired or not, regardless of their shell. So probably not B.

Option C says each electron has a unique magnetic moment. Wait, but paired electrons have opposite moments, so they cancel. So C seems incorrect because their moments wouldn't be unique in that way; they're opposite.

Option D says free radicals lack pairs, so can't generate a magnetic moment. But that's the opposite of what we want. Free radicals do have unpaired electrons, so they do have a magnetic moment. So D is wrong.

Option E says pairs spin the same, enhancing the moment. No, paired electrons have opposite spins, so E is incorrect.

Option F says pairs generate the same magnitude. But if they're opposite, the net would be zero. So F is wrong.

Option G says spins cancel only in an external field. That doesn't fit. The pairing causes cancellation regardless of the field, I think. So G might not be right.

Option H says each electron in a pair has a magnetic moment but of equal and opposite magnitude, so the pair has no net moment. That sounds correct because paired spins cancel each other out. So H seems like the right answer.

Option I talks about high temperatures. Doesn't seem relevant here. So I is probably wrong.

Option J says pairs reinforce the magnetic moment. No, because their moments are opposite, so they don't reinforce; they cancel. So J is incorrect.

So the correct reasoning is that paired electrons have opposite magnetic moments, canceling each other. Hence, only unpaired electrons (free radicals) contribute to a magnetic moment, which is why they show certain spectra.

The correct answer is H. Paired electrons have opposite magnetic moments, so their net magnetic moment cancels out. Only unpaired electrons, as in free radicals, contribute to a magnetic moment, which is why they exhibit certain spectra.
