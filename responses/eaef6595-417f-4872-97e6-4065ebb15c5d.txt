Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. The question is about calculating the energy emitted by Avogadro's number of atoms, each emitting a light wave with a wavelength of 400 nm. Hmm, I remember that energy and wavelength are related through Planck's equation, so I should start there.

First, I recall that Planck's equation is E = hc/λ, where E is the energy, h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. Right, so I need to find the energy per photon emitted by each atom. 

Wait, but the atoms are emitting light, so each atom would emit one photon, I think. So each atom emits one photon of 400 nm. So first, I'll calculate the energy of one photon and then multiply by Avogadro's number to get the total energy emitted.

Avogadro's number is approximately 6.022 x 10^23 molecules/mol or atoms in this case. So, let me write down the values I know:

h = 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s  
c = 3.00 x 10^8 m/s  
λ = 400 nm. Oh wait, nanometers are 10^-9 meters. So 400 nm is 400 x 10^-9 m = 4 x 10^-7 m.

Now plug these into the equation E = hc/λ.

Calculating that: E = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3.00e8 m/s) / (4e-7 m).

Let me compute the numerator first: 6.626e-34 * 3.00e8 = (6.626 * 3.00) x 10^(-34 +8) = 19.878e-26 J·m. Wait, that's 1.9878e-25 J·m?

Wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately. 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = (6.626 *3) = 19.878, and the exponent is 10^(-34 +8) = 10^-26. So 19.878e-26 J·m. Then divide by 4e-7 m.

So 19.878e-26 / 4e-7 = (19.878 /4) x 10^(-26 +7) = 4.9695 x 10^-19 J. Wait, let me double-check the exponents: 1e-26 divided by 1e-7 is 1e-19, yes. So E per photon is approximately 4.97e-19 J.

But wait, let me recalculate that division to be precise. 19.878 divided by 4 is 4.9695, which rounds to about 4.97e-19 J per photon.

Now, since there are Avogadro's number of atoms, each emitting one photon, the total energy E_total would be E_per_photon multiplied by Avogadro's number, N_A = 6.022e23.

So E_total = 4.97e-19 J/photon * 6.022e23 photons.

Let me compute that: 4.97e-19 * 6.022e23.

Multiply the coefficients: 4.97 *6.022 ≈ let's see, 5 *6 is 30, but 4.97 is a bit less. 4.97 *6.022 ≈ (5 - 0.03) *6.022 = 5*6.022 - 0.03*6.022 = 30.11 - 0.18066 ≈ 29.92934.

Now the exponents: 10^(-19 +23) = 10^4.

So E_total ≈ 29.92934e4 J = 2.992934e5 J.

Looking at the options, option F is 2.98e5 J, which is very close. Let me check if I made any rounding errors. I approximated 4.97e-19 as 4.97, and N_A as 6.022e23.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energy more accurately.

Let me recalculate Planck's equation without rounding so quickly.

E = hc/λ

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact value, but I'll use 6.626e-34 for simplicity)
c = 2.99792458e8 m/s, but often approximated as 3.00e8.

λ = 400 nm = 400e-9 m = 4e-7 m.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3.00e8) / (4e-7)
= (1.9878e-25) / 4e-7
Wait, 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Then divide by 4e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 /4e-7 = (1.9878/4) * 1e-18 = 0.49695 *1e-18 = 4.9695e-19 J per photon.

Then multiply by Avogadro's number: 4.9695e-19 *6.022e23.

Compute 4.9695 *6.022 = ?

4 *6=24, 0.9695*6=5.817, so 24 +5.817=29.817.

Then 0.9695 *0.022: wait no, wait, 4.9695 *6.022 = ?

Let me compute 4.9695 *6.022:

4.9695 *6 = 29.817

4.9695 *0.022 = approximately 0.1093.

So total is 29.817 +0.1093=29.9263.

So 29.9263e( -19 +23 ) =29.9263e4 J = 2.99263e5 J.

The options are:

F: 2.98 ×10^5 J

So it's approximately 2.99e5 J, which is about 2.99 x10^5 J, and the closest option is F: 2.98e5 J.

Wait, but why is it 2.98 instead of 2.99? Did I make a mistake in calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should check the exact calculation.

Another approach: compute hc exactly first.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s  
c = 299792458 m/s  
λ = 400e-9 m.

Compute E = (6.62607015e-34 * 299792458) / (400e-9)

First compute numerator: 6.62607015e-34 * 2.99792458e8 = ?

6.62607015 * 2.99792458 ≈ let's compute that. 6 *3=18, but more accurately:

6.62607015 *2.99792458 ≈ 

Let me compute 6.62607 * 3 = 19.87821, but since it's 2.99792458, which is about 3 - 0.00207542.

So 6.62607 * (3 - 0.00207542) = 6.62607*3 - 6.62607 *0.00207542.

6.62607*3 =19.87821.

6.62607 *0.00207542 ≈ approx 0.01373.

So 19.87821 - 0.01373 ≈19.8645.

So approximately 19.8645e-26 J·m, because 1e-34 *1e8 =1e-26.

Wait, 6.62607e-34 *2.9979e8 = (6.62607 *2.9979) x 10^(-34+8) = approx 19.8645e-26 =1.98645e-25 J·m.

Now, E = 1.98645e-25 / 400e-9 m.

Which is 1.98645e-25 /4e-7 = (1.98645 /4) x1e-18.

1.98645 /4=0.4966125, so 0.4966125e-18 J =4.966125e-19 J per photon.

Now, multiply by Avogadro's number: 4.966125e-19 J * 6.02214076e23 atoms.

So 4.966125 *6.02214076 ≈ let's compute that.

4 *6=24, 0.966125 *6=5.79675, so 24+5.79675=29.79675.

Now, 4 *0.02214076=0.088563, and 0.966125 *0.02214076 ≈ approx 0.02136.

So total 29.79675 + 0.088563 +0.02136 ≈29.906673.

Wait, maybe an easier way is to compute 4.966125 *6.02214076.

Let me compute it step by step:

4 *6 =24.

4 *0.02214076= 0.088563.

0.966125 *6=5.79675.

0.966125 *0.02214076≈ let's compute 0.966125 *0.02 =0.0193225, and 0.966125 *0.00214076≈0.002064.

So total is 0.0193225 +0.002064 ≈0.0213865.

Adding all together: 24 +5.79675=29.79675. Then add 0.088563: 29.79675 +0.088563=29.885313. Then add 0.0213865: 29.885313 +0.0213865=29.9067.

So about 29.9067e4 J, which is 2.99067e5 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is F:2.98e5 J. Alternatively, perhaps I should check if I made any miscalculations.

Wait another thought: maybe I should use more precise values for h and c.

Alternatively, perhaps using exact formula with known constants.

Wait, Planck's constant h is 6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact), and c is 299792458 m/s (exact), so let's compute E precisely.

E = (6.62607015e-34 * 299792458) / (400e-9)

Compute numerator: 6.62607015e-34 *2.99792458e8 = 

6.62607015 * 2.99792458 = let's compute that.

6 *2.99792458 =17.9875475.

0.62607015 *2.99792458 ≈ let's compute:

0.6 *2.99792458≈1.798755.

0.02607015 *2.99792458≈approx 0.07819.

So total ≈1.798755 +0.07819≈1.876945.

Adding to 17.9875475: 17.9875475 +1.876945≈19.8644925.

So numerator is 19.8644925e-26 J·m =1.98644925e-25 J·m.

Divide by λ=400e-9 m=4e-7 m.

E =1.98644925e-25 /4e-7 = (1.98644925/4) *1e-18 = 0.4966123125e-18 J =4.966123125e-19 J per photon.

Now multiply by Avogadro's number, N_A=6.02214076e23.

E_total=4.966123125e-19 *6.02214076e23.

Compute the product:

4.966123125 *6.02214076 = let's calculate:

4 *6=24,

4 *0.02214076=0.08856304,

0.966123125 *6=5.79673875,

0.966123125 *0.02214076≈approx 0.02138.

Adding all together:

24 +5.79673875=29.79673875,

plus 0.08856304=29.88530179,

plus 0.02138≈29.90668179.

So E_total≈29.90668e4 J=2.990668e5 J.

So approximately 2.9907e5 J, which is 299,070 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is F:2.98 ×10^5 J (298,000 J). But wait, my calculation gives about 299,070 J, which is closer to 2.99e5 J. However, the options don't have that. The options are A to J, and F is 2.98e5, which is 298,000, and G is 4.98e5, which is way higher. H is 3.98e5, which is 398,000. So why is my answer not matching any option exactly?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me double-check.

Wait, let's compute E = hc/λ again. Maybe I should use exact values.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s  
c = 299792458 m/s  
λ = 400e-9 m.

E = (6.62607015e-34 * 299792458) / (400e-9)

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 6.62607015e-34 * 299792458 = ?

6.62607015 * 299792458 = ?

Well, 6 *299792458 = 1,798,754,748.

0.62607015 *299,792,458 ≈ let's compute:

0.6 *299,792,458 ≈ 179,875,475.

0.02607015 *299,792,458 ≈ approx 8,026,000 (since 0.02 *3e8 is 6e6, plus 0.00607015*3e8≈1.821e6, so total ≈7.821e6).

So total ≈179,875,475 +7,821,000 ≈187,696,475.

So total h*c ≈1,798,754,748 +187,696,475 ≈1,986,451,223.

So 6.62607015e-34 *2.99792458e8 ≈1.986451223e-25 J·m.

Now, E = 1.986451223e-25 J·m / 400e-9 m = 1.986451223e-25 /4e-7 = (1.986451223 /4) *1e-18 = 0.49661280575e-18 J =4.9661280575e-19 J per photon.

Now multiply by Avogadro's number, 6.02214076e23:

4.9661280575e-19 *6.02214076e23 = (4.9661280575 *6.02214076) *1e4.

Compute 4.9661280575 *6.02214076:

Let me compute this precisely:

4 *6 =24.

4 *0.02214076=0.08856304.

0.9661280575 *6=5.796768345.

0.9661280575 *0.02214076≈0.02138.

Adding all together:

24 +5.796768345=29.796768345.

+0.08856304=29.885331385.

+0.02138≈29.906711385.

So E_total≈29.906711385e4 J=2.9906711385e5 J.

So approximately 2.9907e5 J.

Looking back at the options, F is 2.98e5 J, which is 298,000 J, which is very close but just slightly lower. The other options are either higher or much lower.

But wait, perhaps I should consider significant figures. The wavelength is given as 400 nm, which has 3 significant figures. Avogadro's number is exact, and constants like h and c are known precisely. So the answer should be expressed to 3 significant figures.

So 2.9907e5 J, which is approximately 2.99e5 J. But none of the options have 2.99e5. The closest is F:2.98e5, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the product 4.9661280575e-19 *6.02214076e23.

Let me compute 4.9661280575 *6.02214076 accurately.

4.9661280575 *6.02214076:

Compute 4 *6.02214076 =24.08856304.

0.9661280575 *6.02214076:

Compute 0.9 *6.02214076=5.419926684.

0.0661280575 *6.02214076 ≈approx 0.066128 *6.02214 ≈0.3983.

So total 5.419926684 +0.3983 ≈5.8182.

So total 24.08856304 +5.8182≈29.90676304.

So 29.90676304e4 J=2.990676304e5 J≈2.9907e5 J.

So approximately 2.9907e5 J. Since none of the options is exactly 2.99e5, perhaps the intended answer is option F: 2.98e5 J.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if I made a mistake in the initial formula. Wait, another thought: each atom emits a photon, so the total energy is per photon multiplied by Avogadro's number. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes each atom emits one mole of photons? No, that can't be, because the question says each emits a single photon.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about energy per mole of atoms, but the way it's phrased is "Avogadro number of atoms", which is 1 mole, so that's correct.

Wait, maybe I messed up the exponents in the calculation. Let me double-check.

E = (6.626e-34 *3e8) /4e-7 = (1.9878e-25) /4e-7 =1.9878e-25 /4e-7 = (1.9878/4) *1e-18 =0.49695e-18=4.9695e-19 J per photon.

Multiply by 6.022e23: 4.9695e-19 *6.022e23 =4.9695 *6.022 *1e4.

4.9695 *6.022 ≈ let me compute this accurately.

4.9695 *6 =29.817

4.9695 *0.022= 0.109329.

Total≈29.817 +0.109329=29.926329.

So 29.926329e4 J=2.9926329e5 J≈2.9926e5 J.

So again, about 2.993e5 J, which is 299,300 J.

The options are:

A:5.20 ×1e5

B:2.58e5

C:2.20e5

D:3.50e5

E:1.98e5

F:2.98e5

G:4.98e5

H:3.98e5

I:1.50e5

J:6.02e5

So the closest is F:2.98e5, which is 298,000. My calculation is 299,300, which is about 2.99e5. The options don't have that, but F is the closest. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use hc=12400 eV·nm. Oh, wait, that's another way to compute photon energy in electron volts.

Because 1 eV =1.602e-19 J.

So hc=12400 eV·nm.

So E_photon (in eV) =12400 eV·nm /400 nm =31 eV.

Wait, that's a much simpler way. So each photon has energy 31 eV.

Now, convert 31 eV to joules: 31 eV *1.602e-19 J/eV = 31 *1.602e-19 =49.662e-19 J, which matches our earlier calculation of ~4.966e-19 J.

Now, multiply by Avogadro's number (6.022e23):

49.662e-19 J/photon *6.022e23 photons =49.662 *6.022e4 J.

Compute 49.662 *6.022:

49 *6=294.

49 *0.022=1.078.

0.662 *6=3.972.

0.662 *0.022≈0.014564.

Adding all together: 294 +1.078=295.078; +3.972=299.05; +0.014564≈299.064564.

So 299.064564e4 J=2.99064564e5 J≈2.9906e5 J.

Again, same result. So it's approximately 2.99e5 J. The closest option is F:2.98e5 J.

But wait, 2.99e5 is 299,000, and F is 298,000. The difference is 1,000 J. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to use a different value for Planck's constant or speed of light, or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the initial calculation using hc=12400 eV·nm is more straightforward.

E_photon=12400 /400 =31 eV.

Then total energy is 31 eV *6.022e23 atoms =31 *6.022e23 eV.

Convert eV to J: 31 *6.022e23 *1.602e-19 J.

Compute 31 *6.022e23 =186.682e23 =1.86682e25.

Multiply by 1.602e-19: 1.86682e25 *1.602e-19= (1.86682 *1.602) e6.

1.86682 *1.602≈ let's compute:

1.8 *1.6=2.88.

0.06682*1.6≈0.1069.

1.8 *0.002=0.0036.

0.06682 *0.002≈0.00013364.

So total ≈2.88 +0.1069=2.9869 +0.0036=2.9905 +0.00013364≈2.9906.

So 2.9906e6 J? Wait, no, wait: 1e25 *1e-19=1e6. So 1.86682e25 *1.602e-19= (1.86682 *1.602) *1e6.

Which is 2.9906 *1e6=2.9906e6 J? Wait, no, that can't be right, because earlier calculations gave 2.99e5 J. Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents.

Wait, 31 eV *6.022e23 atoms =31 *6.022e23 eV =1.86682e25 eV.

Now, converting eV to J: 1 eV=1.602e-19 J.

So total J=1.86682e25 *1.602e-19 = (1.86682 *1.602) *1e6.

Because 1e25 *1e-19 =1e6.

So 1.86682 *1.602 ≈2.9906.

So total J=2.9906e6 J? Wait, that's 2,990,600 J, which is 2.9906e6 J. But that's way higher than our previous calculation of ~2.99e5 J.

Wait, that can't be right. I must have messed up the exponents somewhere.

Wait, 31 eV *6.022e23 atoms = 31 *6.022e23 eV =1.86682e25 eV.

But 1 eV =1.602e-19 J, so 1.86682e25 eV *1.602e-19 J/eV = (1.86682 *1.602) *1e(25-19) =2.9906 *1e6 =2.9906e6 J. But that's 2,990,600 J, which is 2.9906e6 J. But earlier calculations gave ~2.99e5 J. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, no, earlier I used hc/λ in J·s and m, so the result was in J per photon. Then multiplied by Avogadro's number, which is correct.

But when using hc=12400 eV·nm, 31 eV per photon, multiplied by Avogadro's number gives 31 *6.022e23 eV =1.86682e25 eV.

Then converting to J:1.86682e25 eV *1.602e-19 J/eV = (1.86682 *1.602) *1e6 J.

Which is 2.9906e6 J.

Wait, that's inconsistent with the previous calculation which gave ~2.99e5 J.

So that suggests I made a mistake in one of the methods. Let me find where.

Wait, earlier when I used hc=6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25 J·m. Divided by 4e-7 m gives 4.9695e-19 J per photon.

Multiply by 6.022e23 photons:4.9695e-19 *6.022e23 =4.9695 *6.022e4 =29.926e4 =2.9926e5 J.

But the other method using eV gives 2.9906e6 J, which is 10 times higher. So I must have made an error in the eV approach.

Wait, no, let me double-check the eV approach.

hc=12400 eV·nm. So E_photon =12400 /λ in nm.

λ=400 nm, so E_photon=12400/400=31 eV. Correct.

Now, energy per photon is 31 eV.

Total energy for Avogadro's number of photons:31 eV *6.022e23 =31 *6.022e23 eV.

Convert eV to joules: each eV is 1.602e-19 J.

So total J=31 *6.022e23 *1.602e-19 =31 *6.022 *1.602 *1e(23-19) =31 *6.022 *1.602 *1e4.

Calculate 31 *6.022 =186.682.

186.682 *1.602 ≈299.064.

Then 299.064 *1e4 =2.99064e5 J.

Ah, okay, I see where I went wrong earlier. The exponents: 1e23 *1e-19 =1e4, not 1e6. So the correct calculation is 2.99064e5 J, which matches the earlier result. Phew!

So the correct total energy is approximately 2.99e5 J. Now, looking back at the options, F is 2.98e5 J, which is very close. So the intended answer is likely option F.

To determine the total energy emitted by Avogadro's number of atoms, each emitting a photon of wavelength 400 nm, we use the relationship between energy and wavelength given by Planck's equation:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

Where:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (Planck's constant),
- \( c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light),
- \( \lambda = 400 \, \text{nm} = 400 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \).

### Step 1: Energy per photon
Substituting the values into the equation:

\[
E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34}) (3.00 \times 10^8)}{400 \times 10^{-9}}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times 3.00 \times 10^8 = 1.9878 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J·m}.
\]

Now divide by \( \lambda \):

\[
E = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{400 \times 10^{-9}} = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{4 \times 10^{-7}} = 4.9695 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

Thus, each photon has an energy of approximately \( 4.9695 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \).

### Step 2: Total energy for Avogadro's number of atoms
Avogadro's number is \( N_A = 6.022 \times 10^{23} \). The total energy emitted by \( N_A \) atoms is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = (4.9695 \times 10^{-19}) \times (6.022 \times 10^{23}).
\]

Multiply the coefficients:

\[
4.9695 \times 6.022 \approx 29.926.
\]

Now adjust the powers of 10:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = 29.926 \times 10^4 = 2.9926 \times 10^5 \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 3: Comparing with the options
The calculated total energy is approximately \( 2.99 \times 10^5 \, \text{J} \). Among the given options, the closest value is:

**F: \( 2.98 \times 10^5 \, \text{J} \).**

### Final Answer:
F
