Okay, so I need to figure out how much Mr. Torres earned from his Krescostock shares in a year. Let's start by breaking down the problem.

He owns 350 shares. Each quarter, the stock pays a dividend of $1.20 per share. Plus, there's an extra year-end dividend of $0.30 per share. I need to calculate his total income from these dividends for the year.

First, let's think about the quarterly dividends. Since there are four quarters in a year, he gets four payments of $1.20 each per share. So, for each share, that's 4 times $1.20. Let me calculate that: 4 * 1.20 = $4.80 per share per year from the regular dividends.

Then, there's the extra year-end dividend of $0.30 per share. That's just one additional payment at the end of the year. So for each share, that's another $0.30.

Adding those together, the total dividends per share per year would be $4.80 + $0.30 = $5.10 per share.

Now, he owns 350 shares. So, I multiply the per-share total by the number of shares: 350 * $5.10. Let me do that step by step. 

350 * 5 = 1750, and 350 * 0.10 = 35. Adding those together gives 1750 + 35 = $1,785.

Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way is to compute 350 * 5.10 directly. 350 * 5 is 1750, 350 * 0.1 is 35, so 1750 +35 is indeed 1785.

Looking at the options, H is $1,785, which must be the correct answer.

The total income is calculated by multiplying the number of shares (350) by the sum of the quarterly and extra dividends per share. The quarterly dividend is $1.20, paid four times a year, and the extra dividend is $0.30. Therefore, each share yields $4.80 (from quarterly dividends) + $0.30 = $5.10 annually. Multiplying $5.10 by 350 shares gives a total income of $1,785.

Answer: H
