I: 3 bottles of soda, 2 six-packs of beer, and 1 liter of wine
J: 1 bottle of soda, 4 six-packs of beer, and 2 liters of wine

Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so Mrs. McCoy wants to buy soda, beer, and wine, and she has a budget of $17. She wants to maximize her total utility. Hmm, I remember that utility maximization involves getting the highest possible total utility given the budget constraints. So, I think I need to use the concept of marginal utility per dollar to decide how much of each product she should buy.

Let me look at the data provided. The costs are: soda is $1 per bottle, beer is $2 per six-pack, and wine is $4 per liter. Her marginal utilities for each are given in the table.

So, I should start by calculating the marginal utility per dollar for each product. That way, I know which gives the most utility per dollar spent.

For soda:
- The MU for each bottle is as follows: first is 10, then 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 utils.
- Since each bottle costs $1, the MU per dollar for each unit is the same as the MU.

For beer:
- The MU per six-pack is: first is 50, second 40, third 30, fourth 20, fifth 16, sixth 12.
- Each six-pack costs $2, so the MU per dollar is MU divided by 2.

For wine:
- The MU per liter is: first 60, second 40, third 32, fourth 24, fifth 20, sixth 16.
- Each liter is $4, so MU per dollar is MU divided by 4.

Let me calculate these:

Soda:
1st: 10 utils/$1 → 10
2nd:9 →9
3rd:8 →8
4th:7 →7
5th:6 →6
6th:5 →5

Beer:
1st:50/2=25
2nd:40/2=20
3rd:30/2=15
4th:20/2=10
5th:16/2=8
6th:12/2=6

Wine:
1st:60/4=15
2nd:40/4=10
3rd:32/4=8
4th:24/4=6
5th:20/4=5
6th:16/4=4

Now, I think the strategy is to buy the products in the order of highest MU per dollar until the budget is exhausted. So, the order is:

First, highest is soda at 10, then beer at 25? Wait, no. Wait, let me list all the possible MU per dollar for each item:

Soda's first unit is 10, which is the highest. Then beer's first is 25? Wait, no, beer's first MU per dollar is 25, which is higher than soda's 10. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me recalculate.

Wait, soda's first unit is 10 per dollar. Beer's first is 50/2=25. Wine's first is 60/4=15. So, the order of priority is:

1. Beer first unit: 25
2. Soda first unit:10
3. Wine first unit:15
Wait, no, 15 is less than 25 and 10 is less. Wait, no: 25 (beer), 15 (wine), 10 (soda). So, the order should be:

First, buy as much beer as possible where each unit gives the highest MU per dollar, then move to wine, then soda, but I have to check each step.

Wait, no, actually, we need to consider each possible unit in the order of highest MU per dollar across all products.

So, the highest is beer's first six-pack (25). Then wine's first liter (15), then soda's first bottle (10). Then, for the next round, beer's second is 20, wine's second is 10, soda's second is 9. Then beer's third is 15, wine's third is 8, soda's third is 8. Then beer's fourth is 10, wine's fourth is 6, soda's fourth is7. Wait, I think I need to list all possible marginal utilities in order.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to list all possible next marginal utilities in descending order, considering each possible next unit, and pick the highest until the budget is used up.

Let me try to list them:

1. Beer 1: 25
2. Wine 1:15
3. Soda 1:10
4. Beer 2:20
5. Wine 2:10
6. Soda 2:9
7. Beer 3:15
8. Wine 3:8
9. Soda 3:8
10. Beer 4:10
11. Wine 4:6
12. Soda 4:7
13. Beer 5:8
14. Wine 5:5
15. Soda 5:6
16. Beer 6:6
17. Wine 6:4
18. Soda 6:5

Wait, this might get complicated, but I think the approach is to take the highest MU per dollar first, then the next, and so on, until the total spent is $17.

So, let's start:

Budget: $17.

1. Buy Beer 1: cost $2, utility +50. Remaining: $15.

2. Next highest is Wine 1: cost $4, utility +60. Remaining: $11.

3. Next highest is Soda 1: $1, +10. Remaining: $10.

4. Next highest is Beer 2: $2, +40. Remaining: $8.

5. Next highest is Soda 2: $1, +9. Remaining: $7.

6. Next highest is Wine 2: $4, +40. Remaining: $3.

7. Next highest is Beer 3: $2, +30. Remaining: $1.

8. Next highest is Soda 3: $1, +8. Now, remaining $0.

Wait, but let's check the total cost:

Beer 1: $2

Wine 1: $4 → total so far $6

Soda 1: $1 → $7

Beer 2: $2 → $9

Soda 2: $1 → $10

Wine 2: $4 → $14

Beer 3: $2 → $16

Soda 3: $1 → $17

Total spent: $17.

Total utility: 50 +60 +10 +40 +9 +40 +30 +8 = 50+60=110; +10=120; +40=160; +9=169; +40=209; +30=239; +8=247 utils.

Wait, but let me check if this is the correct approach. Because sometimes, when you have multiple units, you might have overlapping. Also, perhaps I should check if buying more of a cheaper item with higher MU per dollar could give a better total.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the standard method of comparing marginal utilities per price.

But perhaps I'm complicating it. Let me try another approach: using the rule of equal marginal utility per dollar.

So, the idea is to allocate the budget so that the marginal utility per dollar is the same across all goods.

But since we're dealing with discrete units, perhaps it's better to go step by step.

Let me try again.

We need to buy quantities of soda (S), beer (B), wine (W), such that 1*S + 2*B +4*W =17.

We need to maximize total utility: sum of MUs for each unit.

The MUs are:

Soda: 10,9,8,7,6,5

Beer:50,40,30,20,16,12

Wine:60,40,32,24,20,16

So, for each unit, we have to decide whether to buy it based on the MU per dollar.

Let me list the options in order of highest MU per dollar:

1. Beer 1: 50/2=25

2. Wine 1:60/4=15

3. Soda 1:10/1=10

4. Beer 2:40/2=20

5. Wine 2:40/4=10

6. Soda 2:9/1=9

7. Beer 3:30/2=15

8. Wine 3:32/4=8

9. Soda 3:8/1=8

10. Beer 4:20/2=10

11. Wine 4:24/4=6

12. Soda 4:7/1=7

13. Beer 5:16/2=8

14. Wine 5:20/4=5

15. Soda 5:6/1=6

16. Beer 6:12/2=6

17. Wine 6:16/4=4

18. Soda 6:5/1=5

Now, the order is:

1. Beer 1 (25)

2. Wine 1 (15)

3. Soda 1 (10)

4. Beer 2 (20)

5. Wine 2 (10)

6. Soda 2 (9)

7. Beer 3 (15)

8. Wine 3 (8)

9. Soda 3 (8)

10. Beer 4 (10)

11. Wine 4 (6)

12. Soda 4 (7)

13. Beer 5 (8)

14. Wine 5 (5)

15. Soda 5 (6)

16. Beer 6 (6)

17. Wine 6 (4)

18. Soda 6 (5)

Now, I'll start buying the highest ones until I reach $17.

Start with Beer 1: cost $2, budget left $15.

Next, Wine 1: $4, budget left $11.

Next, Soda 1: $1, budget left $10.

Next, Beer 2: $2, budget left $8.

Next, Wine 2: $4, budget left $4.

Next, Soda 2: $1, budget left $3.

Next, Beer 3: $2, budget left $1.

Next, Soda 3: $1, budget left $0.

Wait, that's a total of:

Beer:1+2+3=6 six-packs? Wait no, because each beer is a six-pack, so buying Beer 1, Beer 2, Beer3 would be 1,2,3 packs? No, wait, no. Wait, each Beer unit is a six-pack. So, buying Beer 1 (first six-pack), then Beer 2 (second), Beer 3 (third), etc. So, each unit is one six-pack.

But wait, the cost is per six-pack, so each unit is a six-pack. So, buying one beer unit costs $2, which is one six-pack.

Similarly, one wine unit is one liter, costing $4.

One soda unit is one bottle, $1.

So, when I buy Beer 1, that's one six-pack.

So, in this selection, I've bought:

Beer 1, 2, 3: 3 six-packs (3*$2=$6)

Wine 1,2: 2 liters (2*$4=$8)

Soda 1,2,3: 3 bottles (3*$1=$3)

Wait, adding up: 6 +8 +3=17. Yes.

But let me check the total utility:

Beer 1:50

Wine 1:60

Soda 1:10

Beer 2:40

Wine 2:40

Soda 2:9

Beer 3:30

Soda3:8

Total:50+60=110; +10=120; +40=160; +40=200; +9=209; +30=239; +8=247.

Wait, but is this the maximum? Let me check if there's a better combination.

Alternatively, perhaps buying more of a product with higher utility per dollar in the next steps.

Wait, after buying up to Soda 3, the budget is used up. But perhaps there's a better way.

Wait, another approach: let's try to find the optimal combination by checking which options match the given choices.

Looking at the options, option I is 3 soda, 2 beer, 1 wine. Let me see what that would cost.

3 bottles:3*1=3

2 six-packs:2*2=4

1 liter:1*4=4

Total:3+4+4=11, which is under $17. So that's not the case. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, no, option I is 3 bottles, 2 beer, 1 wine. So 3*1 +2*2 +1*4=3+4+4=11. That leaves $6 unused, which doesn't make sense because she wants to spend $17.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the options again.

Wait, option A:2 soda,2 beer,2 wine: 2+4+8=14. Leaves $3.

Option B:2,3,3: 2+6+12=20. Over budget.

Option C:3,1,3:3+2+12=17. Oh, that's exactly $17.

So, option C is 3 soda, 1 beer, 3 wine.

Let me calculate the total utility for that.

Soda:3 bottles: MUs are 10,9,8 → sum=27

Beer:1 six-pack:50

Wine:3 liters:60,40,32 → sum=132

Total utility:27+50+132=209.

Wait, but earlier when I selected Beer1, Wine1, Soda1, Beer2, Wine2, Soda2, Beer3, Soda3, the total was 247, which is higher. But that combination would be 3 beer, 2 wine, 3 soda. Let me check the cost:

3 beer:3*$2=6

2 wine:2*$4=8

3 soda:3*$1=3

Total:6+8+3=17. Yes.

So, that's possible. But the option I don't see that combination in the options. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option I:3 bottles, 2 beer, 1 wine: 3+4+4=11.

Option D:2,4,1:2+8+4=14.

Option E:5,1,2:5+2+8=15.

Option F:1,3,3:1+6+12=19. Over.

Option G:4,2,1:4+4+4=12.

Option H:6,0,2:6+0+8=14.

Option J:1,4,2:1+8+8=17.

Ah, option J is 1 soda,4 beer,2 wine.

Let me calculate the cost:1*1 +4*2 +2*4=1+8+8=17.

Total utility for option J:

Soda 1:10

Beer 4 six-packs:50+40+30+20=140

Wine 2 liters:60+40=100

Total:10+140+100=250.

Wait, that's higher than the 247 I had earlier. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier selection.

Wait, but how can that be? Because when I selected Beer1, Wine1, Soda1, Beer2, Wine2, Soda2, Beer3, Soda3, that would be Beer3, which is the third six-pack, but that would be 3 beer six-packs, which is 3*$2=6. Wine2 is two liters:2*$4=8. Soda3 is three bottles:3*$1=3. Total:6+8+3=17. So that's a valid combination, but I don't see that as an option.

Looking at the options, none of them have 3 beer, 2 wine, 3 soda. The closest is option I, which has 3 soda, 2 beer, 1 wine. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to buy the highest MU per dollar until the marginal utilities per dollar are equal or the budget is exhausted.

Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to find the combination where the marginal utilities per dollar are equal across all products, but since the quantities are discrete, it's not always possible.

Let me try to compute the optimal bundle step by step.

Step 1: Buy Beer1 (MU/P=25). Cost:2. Remaining:15.

Step 2: Next highest is Wine1 (15). Cost:4. Remaining:11.

Step 3: Next is Soda1 (10). Cost:1. Remaining:10.

Step 4: Next highest is Beer2 (20). Cost:2. Remaining:8.

Step 5: Next is Wine2 (10). Cost:4. Remaining:4.

Step6: Next is Soda2 (9). Cost:1. Remaining:3.

Step7: Next is Beer3 (15). Cost:2. Remaining:1.

Step8: Next is Soda3 (8). Cost:1. Remaining:0.

So, the combination is:

Beer:3, Wine:2, Soda:3.

But looking at the options, none of them have 3 beer, 2 wine, 3 soda. So perhaps I made a mistake, or perhaps the correct option is not listed, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again.

Looking at option J:1 soda,4 beer,2 wine.

Let me see the total MU for that.

Soda:1 →10.

Beer:4 →50+40+30+20=140.

Wine:2 →60+40=100.

Total:10+140+100=250.

Cost:1+8+8=17.

This seems better than the earlier 247.

Wait, but why didn't my earlier step-by-step selection include this? Because when I selected Beer3, I only had $1 left, which allowed me to buy Soda3. But perhaps buying Beer4 would be better.

Wait, let's recast the selection.

After buying Beer1, Wine1, Soda1, Beer2, Wine2, Soda2, I have spent 2+4+1+2+4+1=14. Remaining: $3.

At this point, the next highest MU per dollar is Beer3 at 15, which costs $2. So I can buy Beer3, leaving $1. Then, I can buy Soda3 for $1, using up the budget.

So, the combination is Beer1,2,3; Wine1,2; Soda1,2,3. Total cost:2+4+1+2+4+1+2+1=17.

Total MU:50+40+30 +60+40 +10+9+8=50+40=90; +30=120; +60=180; +40=220; +10=230; +9=239; +8=247.

But option J has a higher total MU of 250. How is that possible?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that after buying Beer3, I have $1 left, but perhaps instead of buying Soda3, I could buy Beer4, which has a MU of 20, and cost $2, but I only have $1 left. So no, can't buy Beer4.

Alternatively, perhaps I should not buy Beer3 and instead buy more wine or soda.

Wait, let me try another path.

After step 5: Beer1, Wine1, Soda1, Beer2, Wine2. Total spent:2+4+1+2+4=13. Remaining:4.

Next, the highest available is Beer3 at 15, or Soda2 at 9, or Wine3 at 8.

But with $4 left, I can buy Beer3 (cost $2) and then have $2 left. Then, perhaps buy Wine3 (cost $4) but that would require $4, but only $2 left. So, perhaps buy Beer3 and Soda2.

Wait, but let's try:

After step5:

Total spent:13. Remaining:4.

Option 1: Buy Beer3 ($2), remaining:2.

Then, with $2, buy Soda2 ($1) and Soda3 ($1), but that would use $2, total spent 15, leaving $2. Wait, no, initial remaining was 4. 4-2=2. Then, buy Soda2 and Soda3, but that's $2, so total spent 13+2+2=17.

So, in this case, the combination would be Beer1,2,3; Wine1,2; Soda1,2,3. Which is what I had before, giving 247.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to buy more where the MU per dollar is higher.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that after buying Beer1, Wine1, Soda1, Beer2, Wine2, I have $4 left. Now, the next highest is Beer3 (15), but perhaps I can buy two units of something else.

Wait, with $4, I can buy Beer3 ($2) and then have $2 left, which can be used for Soda2 ($1) and Soda3 ($1), totaling 17.

But that would be the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps I can buy Wine3 ($4) with the remaining $4, but Wine3's MU is 32, which gives MU per dollar of 8. Comparing that to Beer3's 15, it's better to buy Beer3.

So, I think the optimal combination is 3 beer, 2 wine, 3 soda, totaling 17.

But since none of the options match that, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking back at the options, option J is 1 soda,4 beer,2 wine.

Cost:1+8+8=17.

Total MU:10+ (50+40+30+20) + (60+40)=10+140+100=250.

That's higher than 247.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial selection. How?

Because when I selected Beer3, I could have instead allocated the remaining $4 to buy Wine3, but I think I have to compare the marginal utilities.

Wait, after step5: spent 13, remaining 4.

The next options are:

- Beer3: $2, MU=30, MU/P=15.

- Wine3: $4, MU=32, MU/P=8.

- Soda2: $1, MU=9, MU/P=9.

- Soda3: $1, MU=8, MU/P=8.

So, the highest next is Beer3 (15). So, buy Beer3 for $2, remaining $2.

Now, with $2, I can buy two units: perhaps two soda bottles, which would give MUs of 9 and 8, totaling 17.

So, total MU would be:

Beer1:50, Beer2:40, Beer3:30 → 120.

Wine1:60, Wine2:40 → 100.

Soda1:10, Soda2:9, Soda3:8 →27.

Total:120+100+27=247.

Alternatively, if I had, after step5, with $4 left, used it to buy Wine3 ($4) for MU 32, then the MU would be 50+40+60+40+32=222, plus the other purchases.

Wait, let me recalculate:

If after step5, I have $4 left. I could buy Wine3 for $4, getting MU 32, making total MU:

Beer1:50, Wine1:60, Soda1:10, Beer2:40, Wine2:40, Wine3:32. That's 50+60=110; +10=120; +40=160; +40=200; +32=232.

Then, I have $0 left. But I spent 2+4+1+2+4=13, plus 4 for Wine3: total 17.

Wait, no, that's 2+4+1+2+4+4=17.

So, the combination is Beer1, Beer2, Wine1, Wine2, Wine3, Soda1.

Total MU:50+40+60+40+32+10=232.

Which is less than 247. So, better to buy Beer3 and two sodas.

So, the initial approach seems better.

But then, why does option J give a higher MU? Because in option J, we're buying 4 beers, which gives higher MU for beer.

Let me see:

Option J:1 soda,4 beer,2 wine.

MU:10 (soda1) +50+40+30+20 (beers1-4) +60+40 (wines1-2).

Total:10+50=60; +40=100; +30=130; +20=150; +60=210; +40=250.

Yes, that's 250.

But how is that possible when my step-by-step approach gave 247? Because in the step-by-step, I only bought 3 beers.

Ah, perhaps the mistake is that I didn't consider that buying more beer could be better despite lower MU per dollar. Because after Beer3, the MU per dollar for Beer4 is 20/2=10, which is the same as Soda1's 10.

So, perhaps I should consider that after buying Beer3, the next is Beer4 (MU/P=10), same as Soda1.

So, perhaps I can buy Beer4 instead of Soda3.

Let me try:

After step5: spent 13, remaining 4.

Next, buy Beer3 ($2), remaining 2.

Then, with $2, buy Beer4 ($2), remaining 0.

So, total spent:2+4+1+2+4+2=15? Wait, no. Let me recount:

Beer1:2, Wine1:4, Soda1:1, Beer2:2, Wine2:4, Beer3:2, Beer4:2. Wait, that's 2+4+1+2+4+2+2=17.

Wait, but Beer4 is the fourth six-pack, so its MU is 20.

Total MU:

Beer1:50, Beer2:40, Beer3:30, Beer4:20 → sum=140.

Wine1:60, Wine2:40 → sum=100.

Soda1:10.

Total:140+100+10=250.

Yes, that's the same as option J.

So, the combination would be Beer1,2,3,4; Wine1,2; Soda1.

But wait, that's 4 beers, 2 wines, 1 soda. Which is option J:1 soda,4 beer,2 wine.

So, that's the correct combination, giving total MU of 250, which is higher than the earlier 247.

So, the optimal choice is option J.
</think>

To maximize Mrs. McCoy's total utility within her $17 budget, we need to prioritize purchases based on the marginal utility per dollar (MU/P) for each beverage. The goal is to allocate the budget to the combination that yields the highest total utility.

### Step 1: Calculate Marginal Utility per Dollar (MU/P)
- **Soda**: $1 per bottle  
  MU: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5  
  MU/P: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5  
- **Beer**: $2 per six-pack  
  MU: 50, 40, 30, 20, 16, 12  
  MU/P: 25, 20, 15, 10, 8, 6  
- **Wine**: $4 per liter  
  MU: 60, 40, 32, 24, 20, 16  
  MU/P: 15, 10, 8, 6, 5, 4  

### Step 2: Prioritize Purchases by MU/P
The highest MU/P values are:
1. Beer (1st six-pack): 25  
2. Wine (1st liter): 15  
3. Soda (1st bottle): 10  
4. Beer (2nd six-pack): 20  
5. Wine (2nd liter): 10  
6. Soda (2nd bottle): 9  
7. Beer (3rd six-pack): 15  
8. Wine (3rd liter): 8  
9. Soda (3rd bottle): 8  
10. Beer (4th six-pack): 10  
11. Wine (4th liter): 6  
12. Soda (4th bottle): 7  
13. Beer (5th six-pack): 8  
14. Wine (5th liter): 5  
15. Soda (5th bottle): 6  
16. Beer (6th six-pack): 6  
17. Wine (6th liter): 4  
18. Soda (6th bottle): 5  

### Step 3: Allocate Budget
Starting with the highest MU/P, we select the combination that maximizes utility without exceeding the $17 budget:

1. **Beer (1st six-pack)**: $2, MU = 50  
   Remaining budget: $15  
2. **Wine (1st liter)**: $4, MU = 60  
   Remaining budget: $11  
3. **Soda (1st bottle)**: $1, MU = 10  
   Remaining budget: $10  
4. **Beer (2nd six-pack)**: $2, MU = 40  
   Remaining budget: $8  
5. **Wine (2nd liter)**: $4, MU = 40  
   Remaining budget: $4  
6. **Soda (2nd bottle)**: $1, MU = 9  
   Remaining budget: $3  
7. **Beer (3rd six-pack)**: $2, MU = 30  
   Remaining budget: $1  
8. **Soda (3rd bottle)**: $1, MU = 8  
   Remaining budget: $0  

This combination yields a total utility of **247 utils**. However, upon reviewing the options, **Option J** offers a higher total utility:

- **Option J**: 1 soda, 4 beer, 2 wine  
  - Soda (1st bottle): $1, MU = 10  
  - Beer (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th six-packs): $2 each, MU = 50 + 40 + 30 + 20 = 140  
  - Wine (1st, 2nd liters): $4 each, MU = 60 + 40 = 100  
  - **Total utility**: 10 + 140 + 100 = **250 utils**  
  - **Total cost**: $1 + $8 + $8 = $17  

Thus, **Option J** provides the highest total utility of **250 utils** within the budget.

**Answer: J**
