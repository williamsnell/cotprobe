Okay, so I have this question here about which candy is traditionally fruit flavored. The options are A through J, with various candy names. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through each option.

First, I'll list out the options again to have them clear:
A: Kit Kat
B: M&M's
C: Almond Joy
D: Junior Mints
E: Skittles
F: Milky Way
G: Snickers
H: Butterfinger
I: Hershey's Chocolate Bar
J: Reese's Pieces

I need to figure out which of these is known for being fruit-flavored. Let's go through each one.

Starting with A: Kit Kat. I know Kit Kat is a chocolate bar with layers, usually with a wafer in the middle. I don't think it's fruit-flavored; it's more of a chocolate or possibly vanilla flavor. So probably not A.

B: M&M's. These are chocolates with various fillings. I know there are different varieties like peanut, milk chocolate, etc. I'm not sure about fruit flavors. Wait, I think there are some fruit-flavored M&M's, like strawberry or lemonade. But are they traditionally fruit-flavored? Or are they more known for chocolate? I'm a bit confused here.

C: Almond Joy. This one I'm pretty sure is an almond-based candy, possibly with a coconut layer. I don't think it's fruit-flavored. It's more of a nutty flavor.

D: Junior Mints. These are small, round, and I believe they're a type of mint. So they're likely mint-flavored, not fruit. So D is probably out.

E: Skittles. Oh, Skittles! I remember that Skittles come in a variety of flavors, and they're known for being fruit-flavored. Each piece has a different color and flavor, like strawberry, orange, lemon, lime, and grape. So Skittles are definitely fruit-flavored.

F: Milky Way. This is another chocolate bar. I think it's a caramel-filled bar, so the flavor is more about the caramel and chocolate. Not fruit-flavored.

G: Snickers. Another chocolate bar, with a caramel and peanut filling. Definitely not fruit-flavored.

H: Butterfinger. This is a candy bar with a crispy, buttery center. I don't recall it being fruit-flavored.

I: Hershey's Chocolate Bar. Straight-up chocolate, so no fruit flavors here.

J: Reese's Pieces. These are small, colorful candies, but I think they're more like a mix of chocolate and peanut pieces. Wait, no, actually, Reese's Pieces are similar to M&M's, but I'm not sure about their flavors. I think they might have different flavors, but I'm not certain if they're fruit-flavored traditionally.

Wait, let me think again. Skittles are definitely fruit-flavored. M&M's have some fruit varieties, but are they traditionally fruit-flavored? I think M&M's are more known for their chocolate and peanut versions. Skittles are more directly associated with fruit flavors.

So putting it all together, the answer is E: Skittles.

The candy traditionally known for being fruit-flavored is Skittles, which comes in various fruit flavors like strawberry, orange, lemon, lime, and grape.
