Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an elastic collision between a deuteron and a neutron. Hmm, I remember that in an elastic collision, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. The deuteron is moving at 14.9 km/s and collides with a neutron at rest. The question asks for the final speed of the deuteron after scattering at a LAB angle of 10 degrees. 

Wait, the problem says the deuteron is twice the mass of the neutron. So, let me note that down. Let me call the mass of the neutron m, so the deuteron's mass is 2m. 

Since it's an elastic collision, I can use the conservation laws. But since there's an angle involved, I think I need to break things down into components. Maybe using vectors for velocity.

Let me think about the initial setup. Before the collision, the neutron is at rest, so its initial velocity is zero. The deuteron is moving along, let's say, the x-axis with speed v_i = 14.9 km/s.

After the collision, the deuteron will have a new velocity, v1f, at an angle ψ = 10 degrees in the lab frame. The neutron will move off at some other angle, probably θ, but since we're only asked about the deuteron's speed, maybe I don't need to find the neutron's velocity.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. In the lab frame, the deuteron scatters at 10 degrees. But in elastic collisions, sometimes it's easier to work in the center-of-momentum frame, but maybe that's not necessary here.

Let me recall the conservation equations. For momentum, it's vectorial, so I'll have to consider x and y components.

In the x-direction (momentum before = momentum after):

m_d * v_i = m_d * v1f * cos(ψ) + m_n * v2f * cos(θ)

And in the y-direction:

0 = m_d * v1f * sin(ψ) - m_n * v2f * sin(θ)

Since the neutron is initially at rest, all the initial momentum is along the x-axis.

Also, kinetic energy is conserved:

(1/2) m_d v_i² = (1/2) m_d v1f² + (1/2) m_n v2f²

But since m_d is 2m_n, let me substitute that to simplify. Let me set m_n = m, so m_d = 2m.

So the equations become:

2m * v_i = 2m * v1f * cos(ψ) + m * v2f * cos(θ)

Divide both sides by m:

2 v_i = 2 v1f cosψ + v2f cosθ

Similarly, the y-component equation:

0 = 2m v1f sinψ - m v2f sinθ

Divide by m:

0 = 2 v1f sinψ - v2f sinθ

So,

2 v1f sinψ = v2f sinθ

Now, for the kinetic energy:

(1/2)(2m)v_i² = (1/2)(2m)v1f² + (1/2)m v2f²

Multiply both sides by 2 and divide by m:

2 v_i² = 2 v1f² + v2f²

Hmm, so I have three equations:

1) 2 v_i = 2 v1f cosψ + v2f cosθ

2) 2 v1f sinψ = v2f sinθ

3) 2 v_i² = 2 v1f² + v2f²

I need to solve for v1f, the deuteron's final speed.

This seems a bit involved. Maybe I can express v2f in terms of v1f from equation 2.

From equation 2: v2f = (2 v1f sinψ) / sinθ

But that introduces θ, which is unknown. Alternatively, perhaps I can express cosθ and sinθ in terms of v1f and v2f.

Wait, maybe I can square and add equations 2 and another equation to eliminate θ.

Alternatively, let's express equation 1 in terms of v2f.

From equation 1:

2 v_i = 2 v1f cosψ + v2f cosθ

We can solve for cosθ:

cosθ = (2 v_i - 2 v1f cosψ) / v2f

But then, using equation 2, which gives v2f in terms of v1f and sinθ.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to square equation 2 and equation 1 and then combine them.

Wait, let me think differently. Perhaps using the fact that in elastic collisions, the relative velocity in the direction of impact remains the same. But I'm not sure if that applies here since it's a two-body collision.

Wait, another approach: using the conservation of energy and the fact that in the center-of-mass frame, the velocities are symmetric. But I'm not sure if that helps directly because we have an angle given.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the angle in an elastic collision. I remember that when a particle of mass m1 collides with another of mass m2 at rest, the angle of scattering can be found using certain relations.

Wait, the problem gives the angle ψ in the LAB frame, which is the frame where the neutron is initially at rest.

I think I can use the formula for the velocity after collision in terms of masses and angles.

Wait, maybe using the formula for the velocity of the first particle (deuteron) after collision:

v1f = [ (m1 - m2)/(m1 + m2) ] * v_i

Wait, no, that's only if the collision is head-on and the second particle is at rest. But in this case, since the deuteron is scattered at an angle, it's not head-on, so that formula wouldn't apply directly.

Wait, perhaps considering that in elastic collisions, the speed of the first particle can be found using the formula involving the masses and the angles.

Alternatively, maybe using the relation for the angle of scattering. Let me think.

Wait, from the conservation equations, perhaps I can eliminate θ and find an equation involving v1f and v2f.

Let me consider the two equations:

From equation 2: v2f sinθ = 2 v1f sinψ

From equation 1: 2 v_i = 2 v1f cosψ + v2f cosθ

Let me square both equations and add them to use the identity sin²θ + cos²θ = 1.

So, equation 2 squared: (v2f sinθ)^2 = (2 v1f sinψ)^2 → v2f² sin²θ = 4 v1f² sin²ψ

Equation 1 rearranged: v2f cosθ = 2(v_i - v1f cosψ)

Squaring this: v2f² cos²θ = 4 (v_i - v1f cosψ)^2

Now, adding the two squared terms:

v2f² (sin²θ + cos²θ) = 4 v1f² sin²ψ + 4 (v_i - v1f cosψ)^2

Since sin²θ + cos²θ =1, this becomes:

v2f² = 4 v1f² sin²ψ + 4 (v_i - v1f cosψ)^2

Now, expand the second term on the right:

= 4 [v1f² sin²ψ + (v_i - v1f cosψ)^2 ]

Expanding (v_i - v1f cosψ)^2:

= v_i² - 2 v_i v1f cosψ + v1f² cos²ψ

So, substituting back:

v2f² = 4 [ v1f² sin²ψ + v_i² - 2 v_i v1f cosψ + v1f² cos²ψ ]

= 4 [ v_i² - 2 v_i v1f cosψ + v1f² (sin²ψ + cos²ψ) ]

Since sin² + cos² =1,

v2f² =4 [v_i² - 2 v_i v1f cosψ + v1f² ]

Now, from the kinetic energy equation (equation 3):

2 v_i² = 2 v1f² + v2f² 

We can substitute v2f² from the above expression into this.

So,

2 v_i² = 2 v1f² + 4 [v_i² - 2 v_i v1f cosψ + v1f² ]

Let me compute the right-hand side:

= 2 v1f² + 4 v_i² - 8 v_i v1f cosψ +4 v1f²

= (2 +4) v1f² +4 v_i² -8 v_i v1f cosψ

= 6 v1f² +4 v_i² -8 v_i v1f cosψ

So the equation becomes:

2 v_i² = 6 v1f² +4 v_i² -8 v_i v1f cosψ

Let me rearrange terms:

0 = 6 v1f² +4 v_i² -8 v_i v1f cosψ - 2 v_i²

Simplify:

0 =6 v1f² + 2 v_i² -8 v_i v1f cosψ

Divide both sides by 2:

0=3 v1f² + v_i² -4 v_i v1f cosψ

Rearranged:

3 v1f² -4 v_i v1f cosψ + v_i² =0

This is a quadratic equation in v1f. Let me write it as:

3 v1f² - (4 v_i cosψ) v1f + v_i² =0

Let me use the quadratic formula to solve for v1f.

The quadratic is a x² + b x +c =0, where:

a=3

b= -4 v_i cosψ

c= v_i²

So,

v1f = [4 v_i cosψ ± sqrt( (4 v_i cosψ)^2 -4*3*v_i² ) ]/(2*3)

Simplify the discriminant:

(4 v_i cosψ)^2 -12 v_i² = 16 v_i² cos²ψ -12 v_i² =4 v_i² (4 cos²ψ -3)

So,

v1f = [4 v_i cosψ ± 2 v_i sqrt(4 cos²ψ -3) ]/(6)

Factor out 2 v_i:

v1f = [2 v_i (2 cosψ ± sqrt(4 cos²ψ -3)) ]/(6) = [v_i (2 cosψ ± sqrt(4 cos²ψ -3)) ]/(3)

Now, let's compute this with the given angle ψ=10 degrees.

First, compute cos(10 degrees). Let me get the value:

cos(10°) ≈ 0.9848

So,

4 cos²ψ =4*(0.9848)^2 ≈4*(0.9698)=3.8792

So,

sqrt(4 cos²ψ -3)=sqrt(3.8792-3)=sqrt(0.8792)≈0.9377

So,

v1f = [v_i (2*(0.9848) ± 0.9377)] /3

Calculate the two possibilities:

Case 1: + sign

2*(0.9848)=1.9696

1.9696 + 0.9377=2.9073

v1f = (v_i * 2.9073)/3 ≈ v_i * 0.9691

Case 2: - sign

1.9696 -0.9377=1.0319

v1f = (v_i *1.0319)/3 ≈v_i *0.34397

Now, considering the physical meaning, the deuteron can't gain speed beyond the initial speed because in an elastic collision with a heavier target, but wait, the deuteron is twice the mass of the neutron. So the neutron is lighter. When a heavier particle hits a lighter one at rest, the heavier one might slow down slightly. But in this case, the deuteron is twice the neutron's mass, so it's heavier.

Wait, but the deuteron is the projectile, and the neutron is target. So in a typical scenario, the projectile's speed after collision would be less than initial if the target is at rest. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, let's compute both possibilities.

v_i is 14.9 km/s.

Case 1: v1f ≈14.9 *0.9691≈14.44 km/s

Case 2: v1f≈14.9 *0.34397≈5.13 km/s

But wait, if the deuteron scatters at 10 degrees, it's likely that the speed doesn't drop too much, so 14.44 km/s seems plausible. Alternatively, if it's a collision where the deuteron gains speed, that would be unusual, but in this case, the + sign gives a value less than initial speed, which makes sense because it's transferring some momentum to the neutron.

So, v1f≈14.44 km/s, which is option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, let me compute 4 cos²(10 degrees) again.

cos(10)=0.984807753012208

So, 4*(0.984807753012208)^2 =4*(0.969846310392954) =3.879385241571816

Then, sqrt(3.879385241571816 -3)=sqrt(0.879385241571816)= approximately 0.937739569

So,

v1f = [v_i (2*0.984807753 ± 0.937739569)] /3

Compute each case:

Case 1: (2*0.984807753 +0.937739569)=1.969615506 +0.937739569=2.907355075

v1f= (14.9 *2.907355075)/3 ≈(43.2587)/3≈14.4195 km/s, which rounds to 14.42 km/s, close to option C (14.44 km/s).

Case 2: (2*0.984807753 -0.937739569)=1.969615506 -0.937739569≈1.031875937

v1f= (14.9 *1.031875937)/3 ≈15.3590/3≈5.1196 km/s.

But since the deuteron is heavier, its speed after collision should be less than the initial speed, so 14.42 km/s makes sense. So the answer is option C:14.44 km/s.

The problem involves an elastic collision between a deuteron (mass \(2m\)) and a neutron (mass \(m\)) at rest. Using conservation of momentum and kinetic energy, the final speed of the deuteron is determined by solving a quadratic equation derived from the given conditions. Substituting the angle \(\psi = 10^\circ\) and solving yields the deuteron's final speed as approximately \(14.44 \, \mathrm{km/s}\), corresponding to option C.
