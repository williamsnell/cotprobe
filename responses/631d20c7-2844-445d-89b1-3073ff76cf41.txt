Question:

What is urban yellow fever (YF)?

Options:

A: A YF species that has adapted to new mosquitoes
B: Part of a cycle of mosquitoes biting humans and monkeys in forested areas
C: A YF virus that is transmitted through contaminated water in cities
D: A YF species that has adapted to colder climates in urban areas
E: A mutant of the YF virus
F: Part of a cycle of mosquitoes biting only animals in cities

H: A YF virus that has lost its virulence in urban areas
I: Part of a cycle of mosquitoes biting humans in cities
J: A YF virus that only affects humans in rural areas

Answer:

Okay, so I need to figure out what urban yellow fever (YF) is based on the given options. I remember that yellow fever is a disease caused by a virus and is spread by mosquitoes. Let me break this down.

First, yellow fever has both urban and jungle (forest) cycles. The urban cycle involves transmission between humans and mosquitoes, typically in cities. In the jungle cycle, the virus circulates between monkeys and mosquitoes, and occasionally humans get infected when they enter forested areas.

Looking at the options:

A: A YF species that has adapted to new mosquitoes. I'm not sure about this. Urban YF might involve specific mosquito species, like Aedes aegypti, which is common in cities.

B: Part of a cycle of mosquitoes biting humans and monkeys in forested areas. This sounds more like the jungle cycle, not urban.

C: A YF virus transmitted through contaminated water in cities. No, yellow fever isn't waterborne. It's mosquito-borne.

D: Adapted to colder climates in urban areas. I don't think climate adaptation defines urban YF. It's more about the transmission cycle.

E: A mutant of the YF virus. I don't recall urban YF being called a mutant; it's more about the transmission dynamics.

F: Mosquitoes biting only animals in cities. No, urban YF involves human-mosquito transmission, not just animals.

G: Adapted to rats in urban areas. Rats aren't the main carriers; it's mosquitoes.

H: Lost virulence in urban areas. That doesn't make sense. Urban YF is still virulent.

I: Mosquitoes biting humans in cities. This fits the urban cycle where the virus is maintained between humans and mosquitoes.

J: Affects only humans in rural areas. No, rural areas are more about the monkey cycle, and YF can affect humans there too, but urban is specifically human-focused.

So, urban YF is part of a cycle where mosquitoes bite humans in cities. That points to option I.

The correct answer is I: Part of a cycle of mosquitoes biting humans in cities.

Answer: I
