Okay, so I've got this question about vacuums and molecules. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question says the best vacuum corresponds to a pressure of about 10^-10 dyne cm^-2 at 300 K. I need to find out how many molecules remain in 1 cm³.

Wait, I remember that pressure is related to the number of gas molecules in a given volume. Oh right, the ideal gas law might be useful here. The ideal gas law is PV = NkT, where P is pressure, V is volume, N is the number of molecules, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

I should probably rearrange this formula to solve for N. So N = P V / (k T). Let me note down the values.

P is given as 10^-10 dyne/cm². Oh, wait, I'm not sure about the units. Dyne is the cgs unit for force, and cm² is area, so pressure in cgs units is dynes per cm². Right, so P is 1e-10 dyn/cm².

Volume V is 1 cm³. That's straightforward.

Temperature T is 300 K, which is room temperature, I think. So T = 300 K.

Now, what's Boltzmann's constant k? I remember it's about 1.38e-16 erg/K. Wait, erg is another cgs unit, right? So 1 erg is 1 dyne cm. Oh, because work is force times distance, so dyne*cm = erg.

So k is 1.38e-16 erg/K. Since 1 erg is 1 dyne cm, then k is 1.38e-16 dyne cm / K.

Wait, let me check the units. Because P is in dyne/cm², V is cm³, so P*V would be (dyne/cm²) * cm³ = dyne * cm. Because cm³ over cm² is cm. So P*V has units dyne cm, which is erg. So when I divide by k, which is in erg/K, and multiply by T (K), the units should work out.

Let's plug in the numbers:

N = (P * V) / (k * T)

P = 1e-10 dyne/cm²
V = 1 cm³
k = 1.38e-16 dyne cm/K
T = 300 K

So N = (1e-10 * 1) / (1.38e-16 * 300)

Let me compute the denominator first: 1.38e-16 * 300 = 4.14e-14.

So N = (1e-10) / (4.14e-14) = (1e-10) / (4.14e-14) = (1 / 4.14) * 1e4 ≈ 0.2415 * 1e4 ≈ 2415.

Wait, 1e-10 divided by 4.14e-14 is the same as (1e-10)/(4.14e-14) = (1e4)/(4.14) because 1e-10 / 1e-14 = 1e4.

So 1e4 is 10,000. 10,000 divided by 4.14 is approximately 2415. So N is about 2415 molecules.

Looking at the options, E is 2,500. That's close. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculation. Because sometimes I might mix up exponents.

Calculating N again step by step:

Numerator: P * V = 1e-10 dyne/cm² * 1 cm³ = 1e-10 dyne cm.

Denominator: k*T = 1.38e-16 erg/K * 300 K = 1.38e-16 * 300 erg.

But 1 erg = 1 dyne cm, so denominator is 4.14e-14 dyne cm.

So N = (1e-10 dyne cm) / (4.14e-14 dyne cm) = (1e-10)/(4.14e-14) = (1/4.14) * (1e-10/1e-14) = (0.2415) * (1e4) = 2415.

Yes, that's correct. So the closest option is E: 2,500.

To determine the number of molecules remaining in 1 cm³ under a pressure of \(10^{-10} \, \text{dyne/cm}^2\) at 300 K, we use the ideal gas law:

\[
PV = NkT \quad \Rightarrow \quad N = \frac{PV}{kT}
\]

### Given:
- \(P = 10^{-10} \, \text{dyne/cm}^2\)
- \(V = 1 \, \text{cm}^3\)
- \(T = 300 \, \text{K}\)
- \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{erg/K} = 1.38 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{dyne·cm/K}\) (since \(1 \, \text{erg} = 1 \, \text{dyne·cm}\))

### Calculation:
1. **Numerator**: \(P \cdot V = (10^{-10}) \cdot 1 = 10^{-10} \, \text{dyne·cm}\)
2. **Denominator**: \(k \cdot T = (1.38 \times 10^{-16}) \cdot 300 = 4.14 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{dyne·cm}\)
3. **Number of molecules**:  
   \[
   N = \frac{10^{-10}}{4.14 \times 10^{-14}} = \frac{1}{4.14} \times 10^4 \approx 0.2415 \times 10^4 \approx 2415
   \]

### Conclusion:
The closest option to \(2415\) molecules is \(2500\), corresponding to **Option E**.
