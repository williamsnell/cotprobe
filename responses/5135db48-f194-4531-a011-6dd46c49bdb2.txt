Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

The state registrar of elections refused to put a candidate's name on the ballot because the registrar believed that the candidate was not a resident of the state. The registrar contended that Article I, Section 2 of the U. S. Constitution specifically required a candidate for the House of Representatives "be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen. " As a consequence, the candidate filed suit in state court against the registrar of elections seeking to have her name placed on the ballot. The state court ruled in her favor and determined that the candidate did, in fact, qualify as a resident of the state. The registrar appealed the decision to the state supreme court which, in turn, affirmed the lower court ruling. Thereafter, the candidate's name was placed on the ballot. After a hotly contested election, the candidate narrowly defeated the incumbent. However, at the time that the candidate was to be seated as a House member, the House of Representatives held hearings on her qualifications and eligibility. By a two-thirds vote, the House determined that the candidate was not a resident of the state at the time of her election and refused to seat her. The candidate then brought suit in federal district court against the Speaker and other officers of the House, seeking back pay and an order that she be seated in the House of Representatives. The defendants demurred, claiming lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument supporting the defendants' demurrer?

Options:

A: The suit should have been brought as an original action in the U. S. Supreme Court.
B: The federal court cannot intervene because it would disrupt the separation of powers.
C: Under Article III of the Constitution, the federal courts are not empowered to render advisory opinions.
D: The candidate lacks standing to sue because she was never officially a member of the House of Representatives.
E: The case should have been filed in the state court where the original residency determination was made.
F: The federal court lacks jurisdiction because the House of Representatives has exclusive authority to determine the qualifications of its members.
G: The case is moot because the term of office for which the candidate was elected has already ended.
H: There is no case or controversy between the candidate and the officers of the House of Representatives.
I: The candidate's claims are barred by the Eleventh Amendment.
J: The case presents a nonjusticiable political question.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about constitutional law. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

The scenario is about a candidate who ran for the House of Representatives. The state registrar initially refused to put her name on the ballot because they thought she wasn't a resident. The candidate sued in state court, won, and got her name on the ballot. She then won the election, but when it came time to be seated, the House of Representatives held hearings and, by a two-thirds vote, decided she wasn't a resident and refused to seat her. Now, she's suing in federal court, and the defendants (like the Speaker and other House officers) are saying the federal court lacks jurisdiction.

The question is asking which is the strongest constitutional argument supporting the defendants' claim that the court shouldn't hear the case.

Looking at the options, I think the key here is understanding which constitutional principles apply. The issue revolves around the qualifications of a member of Congress and who has the authority to determine those qualifications.

I remember from my studies that the Constitution gives Congress the authority to set its own rules and qualifications for its members. Specifically, Article I, Section 5 says that each house may determine the rules of its proceedings, including the qualifications of its members. So, the House's decision to not seat her because of residency might be seen as an exercise of that authority.

Also, there's the concept of separation of powers and the idea that certain matters are left to the political branches, not the judiciary. For example, the courts generally don't second-guess the qualifications set by Congress unless there's a clear constitutional violation.

Looking at the options:

A: Suggests an original action in the Supreme Court. That seems more about procedure, but the question is about jurisdiction.

B: Separation of powers is a possibility, but I'm not sure if that's the strongest here.

C: Article III about advisory opinions. The court isn't being asked for an opinion; it's a real dispute. So maybe not.

D: Standing. She was elected and won, so she might have standing, but this isn't the main issue.

E: State court is where the original determination was made, but she's suing in federal court now, and the issue might be about federal constitutional issues.

F: This seems relevant. The House has exclusive authority to determine qualifications, so the federal courts can't interfere.

G: Mootness. Her term hasn't ended yet, so this might not apply.

H: Case or controversy. She's suing to be seated, which is a real dispute.

I: Eleventh Amendment usually applies to states, not federal officers, so probably not.

J: Political question doctrine. This is a possible option because determining qualifications could be seen as a political question not suitable for judicial review.

Between F and J. The political question doctrine is about issues that are inherently political and should be left to the legislative or executive branches. The qualifications of members of Congress are one of those areas where the courts are reluctant to interfere because it's seen as a political matter.

However, there's also a specific constitutional clause in Article I, Section 5, which gives each house exclusive power to judge the qualifications of its members. So, the House's decision is final, and courts can't overturn it. That would make F a strong argument too.

So, F says the federal court lacks jurisdiction because the House has exclusive authority. J says it's a political question. Which is stronger?

I think both F and J are strong contenders, but the specific constitutional grant in Article I, Section 5 might be the more direct reason. The political question doctrine is a broader principle, but here the issue is directly about the House's authority.

So, the strongest argument is probably F.

The strongest constitutional argument supporting the defendants' demurrer is that the House of Representatives has exclusive authority to determine the qualifications of its members under Article I, Section 5 of the U.S. Constitution. This specific grant of authority precludes federal courts from intervening in such matters.

Answer: F
