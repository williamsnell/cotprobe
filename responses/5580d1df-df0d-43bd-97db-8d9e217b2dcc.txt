Okay, so I've got this chemistry question about hybridization in some molecules. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking which of the given molecules exhibit sp² hybridization around the central atom. The molecules in question are CO₂, CO₃²⁻, NO₂⁻, and NO₃⁻. The options are A through J, each listing different combinations.

First, I think I need to remember what sp² hybridization means. From what I recall, hybridization is the mixing of atomic orbitals to form new hybrid orbitals. The notation sp² indicates that one s orbital and two p orbitals are involved, creating three hybrid orbitals. This type of hybridization typically leads to a trigonal planar geometry around the central atom.

So, I need to draw the Lewis structures for each of these molecules to determine their geometry, which will tell me about the hybridization.

Starting with CO₂. Carbon dioxide is a linear molecule. Each oxygen is double-bonded to the central carbon. The Lewis structure would have a double bond on each side, making the molecule linear. Since it's linear, that's 180 degrees. I think that corresponds to sp hybridization because the structure is linear and there are only two regions of electron density. Wait, no, wait: sp hybridization would be for two areas (like linear), but wait, in CO₂, the central carbon has two double bonds. Each double bond counts as one region, so two regions. So that's linear, which is sp hybridization. So CO₂ is sp hybridized, not sp². So that's something to note.

Wait, no, wait again. Let me think. In carbon dioxide, the central carbon has two double bonds, which are each two electron regions, but each double bond is a single region. So two regions, right? So that would be linear, which is sp hybridization. So CO₂ is sp, not sp². So if the question is about sp², CO₂ wouldn't be included.

Next, let's look at CO₃²⁻, the carbonate ion. The central carbon is bonded to three oxygen atoms. Wait, actually, carbonate is CO3²⁻. So carbon is the central atom. Each oxygen is bonded to the carbon. Let me draw the Lewis structure. Carbon has four valence electrons, oxygen has six each. So the structure would be: each oxygen is bonded to the carbon, with double bonds in some places. Wait, but to get the charge right, there are negative charges. Let me think. Carbon has four bonds (single, double, etc.) and the overall charge is -2.

So the Lewis structure for CO3²⁻ would have the central carbon with three single bonds to oxygen and one double bond? Or maybe all single bonds and some double bonds with resonance. Let me think. Carbon has four bonds. So three single bonds and one double bond would give a total of 8 electrons around carbon. Wait, each single bond is 2 electrons, so three single bonds would be 6, plus a double bond (4 electrons) would make 10, but that's too much. Wait, no, the double bond is a single region, so maybe it's more about the number of regions of electron density.

Wait, perhaps the actual structure is that each oxygen has a double bond sometimes, but in resonance. So the carbonate ion has three equivalent structures where each oxygen has a double bond once. So, the central carbon is bonded to three oxygens, with each having a double bond in different resonance structures. So, the actual structure is trigonal planar because there are three regions of electron density around the central carbon (each single bond, but with resonance). So trigonal planar geometry implies sp² hybridization, right? Because trigonal planar corresponds to sp².

Wait, but wait, in CO3²⁻, the central carbon is bonded to three oxygens, each with a single bond, but with resonance. So the actual bonding involves double bonds through resonance. So each oxygen is connected via a double bond in some structures. So the electron domains around the central carbon are three: each oxygen is a single region, but with some having double bonds. So the geometry is trigonal planar. So that's sp² hybridization. So CO3²⁻ would be sp².

Moving on to NO₂⁻. The nitrite ion. Nitrogen is the central atom. Nitrogen has five valence electrons. Each oxygen has six. The overall charge is -1, so there's an extra electron.

The Lewis structure for NO₂⁻ would have nitrogen in the center, with two oxygen atoms attached. Let me count. Nitrogen has five, each oxygen has six, so total valence electrons would be 5 + (2×6) + 1 (charge) = 5 +12 +1=18 electrons.

Drawing the structure: place N in the center. Each O is bonded to N with a single bond. That uses 2×2=4 electrons. Remaining electrons: 18 - 4 =14, which are distributed as lone pairs. But wait, that might not give the correct formal charges. Let me try double bonds.

Alternatively, maybe one double bond. So one O has a double bond, the other has a single bond. Let's see. So N has a double bond with one O and single with the other. That uses 4 electrons (double bond) + 2 (single) =6. Remaining electrons:18-6=12. Distribute as lone pairs: each O in single bond would have 6 electrons (3 lone pairs), and the double-bond O has 4 electrons (2 lone pairs). Wait, but that might not balance. Alternatively, perhaps each O has a double bond, but that would require more electrons.

Wait, maybe it's better to go with the resonance structures. The nitrite ion has two equivalent structures where each O is double-bonded once. So the central nitrogen would have a double bond with each O in different structures, leading to an average of one and a half double bonds. So the actual structure would have regions of electron density: two double bonds and one lone pair on N? Or wait, let me think again. Nitrogen in NO₂⁻ has a formal charge of +1, each O has -1, but that's getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, looking at the geometry: NO₂⁻ has a bent structure, similar to O3. Because the central nitrogen has three regions of electron density: two double bonds and one lone pair. Wait, no, wait: the molecule has a bent geometry, which is V-shaped. So the electron regions (bond pairs and lone pairs) around N would determine the geometry. If there are three regions (two bonds and one lone pair), the geometry is bent. So that would correspond to trigonal planar electron geometry but bent molecular geometry. So the central atom has three regions of electron density, so sp² hybridization.

So, NO₂⁻ would be sp² hybridized.

Lastly, NO3⁻, the nitrate ion. Nitrogen is the central atom. Each oxygen is bonded to N. The Lewis structure would have N in the center with three O atoms. Nitrogen has five valence electrons, each O has six, so total valence electrons: 5 + (3×6) +1 (charge) =5+18+1=24 electrons.

The structure would have resonance, with each O sharing a double bond with N in different structures. So each O has a single bond and one double bond on average. This leads to a trigonal planar geometry around N. So with three regions of electron density, it's sp² hybridized. So NO3⁻ is sp².

Putting it all together:

- CO₂: linear, sp hybridization.
- CO3²⁻: trigonal planar, sp².
- NO2⁻: bent, but three regions (two bonds and one lone pair), so sp².
- NO3⁻: trigonal planar, sp².

So the molecules that exhibit sp² hybridization around the central atom are CO3²⁻, NO2⁻, and NO3⁻. But wait, looking back, the question asks which ones. So let's check each option.

The options are:

E: NO2- and NO3- → So both have sp², but what about CO3²⁻?

Wait, the options don't have all three together, but let me check the options again.

Looking back, the options are:

A: NO2- only → No, because CO3²⁻ and NO3⁻ are also sp².

B: CO2 and CO3²⁻ → CO2 is sp, so no.

C: CO2 only → No.

D: CO2 and NO3- → CO2 is sp, so no.

E: NO2- and NO3- → Both are sp². But wait, CO3²⁻ is also sp². So option E includes only two, but the correct answer includes three. Wait, but looking at the options, option J is CO3²⁻, NO2-, and NO3-, so option J says all three.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: NO2- only

B: CO2 and CO3²-

C: CO2 only

D: CO2 and NO3-

E: NO2- and NO3-

F: CO3²- and NO3-

G: NO3- only

H: CO2 and NO2-

I: CO3²- only

J: CO3²-, NO2-, and NO3-

So from earlier analysis, CO3²⁻ (sp²), NO2⁻ (sp²), NO3⁻ (sp²) all exhibit sp². So the correct answer is J.

Wait, but I thought in the question, the options are given as options A to J. So looking back, the question says: which molecule or molecules exhibit sp² around the central atom. So CO3²⁻, NO₂⁻, and NO3⁻ all have sp². So the correct option is J.

But wait, in my initial analysis, I thought CO3²⁻ is sp², NO2⁻ is sp², and NO3⁻ is sp². So all three are correct. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but let me double-check each molecule.

CO₂: linear, sp → correct.

CO3²⁻: trigonal planar, sp² → correct.

NO2⁻: bent, but three regions → sp² → correct.

NO3⁻: trigonal planar, sp² → correct.

So yes, J is the correct option.

The question asks which molecules exhibit sp² hybridization around the central atom. To determine this, we analyze the geometry of each molecule, as sp² hybridization corresponds to trigonal planar or bent structures with three regions of electron density.

1. **CO₂**: Carbon dioxide has a linear structure with two regions of electron density (two double bonds). This corresponds to sp hybridization, not sp².

2. **CO₃²⁻**: The carbonate ion has a trigonal planar geometry with three regions of electron density (three single bonds with resonance). This corresponds to sp² hybridization.

3. **NO₂⁻**: The nitrite ion has a bent structure with three regions of electron density (two double bonds and one lone pair on nitrogen). This corresponds to sp² hybridization.

4. **NO₃⁻**: The nitrate ion has a trigonal planar geometry with three regions of electron density (three single bonds with resonance). This corresponds to sp² hybridization.

From this analysis, the molecules that exhibit sp² hybridization are CO₃²⁻, NO₂⁻, and NO₃⁻. The correct option is:

**J: CO₃²⁻, NO₂⁻, and NO₃⁻**

Answer: J
