Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this regression model question. Let me break it down. The question is about a regression model that predicts the frequency of tantrums based on three variables: (a) effectiveness of parental commands, (b) consistency of parental discipline, and (c) parental warmth.

Hmm, I remember that in regression models, each predictor variable has its own regression coefficient. The general form is Y = b0 + b1X1 + b2X2 + ... + bnXn + e, where Y is the dependent variable, Xs are the independent variables, bs are the coefficients, and e is the error term. The number of coefficients corresponds to the number of predictors, plus one for the intercept.

Wait, no, wait. The intercept is just one, right? Because it's the value of Y when all Xs are zero. So in this case, there are three predictors. So the model would have one intercept (b0) and three regression coefficients (b1, b2, b3) for each predictor.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that says one y-intercept and three regression coefficients. Let me check the options:

Option A: One regression coefficient and three y-intercepts. No, that doesn't make sense because each variable should have a coefficient, not multiple intercepts.

Option B: Two y-intercepts and two regression coefficients. No, that's not right.

Option C: Four y-intercepts and one regression coefficient. No way.

Option D: Four regression coefficients. Only if there are four predictors, but we have three.

Option E: One y-intercept and three regression coefficients. Oh, this fits! One intercept and three coefficients for each of the three variables.

Option F: One y-intercept and one regression coefficient. Only one predictor would have this, but we have three.

Option G: Three y-intercepts and one regression coefficient. No, same issue as option F but with multiple intercepts which is wrong.

Option H: Three y-intercepts and two regression coefficients. No, still not matching.

Option I: Two y-intercepts and three regression coefficients. Hmm, no, intercepts should be one.

Option J: One y-intercept and two regression coefficients. No, because there are three predictors, so three coefficients.

So the correct answer should be option E: One y-intercept and three regression coefficients.

The regression model includes one dependent variable (frequency of tantrums) and three independent variables (effectiveness of parental commands, consistency of parental discipline, and parental warmth). In a standard linear regression model, each independent variable corresponds to a regression coefficient, and there is one y-intercept. Therefore, the model will have one y-intercept and three regression coefficients.
