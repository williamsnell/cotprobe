Question:

Define behaviorism and social learning theory.

Options:

A: Behaviorism focuses on the analysis of human emotions as the primary factor in behavior, whereas social learning theory emphasizes the role of instinctual drives.
B: Behaviorism refers to a theory that considers only observable behavior. Social learning theory is based on the fact that children imitate and includes the importance of dependency as the major factor that brings about socialization.
C: Social learning theory is a subset of behaviorism that deals exclusively with verbal learning and linguistics.
D: Social learning theory is solely about children's aggression.
E: Behaviorism is a theory that emphasizes the importance of supernatural influences on behavior, while social learning theory focuses on the impact of societal norms only.
F: Behaviorism is concerned with unobservable mental processes.
G: Social learning theory suggests that behavior is entirely shaped by peer pressure, while behaviorism states that behavior is a result of conscious decision-making.
H: Behaviorism and social learning theory both argue that behavior is a direct consequence of divine will, without the influence of the environment or cognition.
I: Behaviorism is based on the idea that behavior is determined by past life experiences, while social learning theory asserts that behavior is solely a result of genetic inheritance.
J: Behaviorism believes in the major role of intrinsic factors in behavior.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about behaviorism and social learning theory. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I need to understand what each theory is about. Behaviorism, as I remember, is a psychological theory that focuses on observable behavior rather than internal mental states. It's all about how the environment affects behavior through conditioning, like classical and operant conditioning. So behaviorists would look at what you can see and measure, not things like emotions or thoughts.

Social learning theory, on the other hand, is a bit different. I think it's more about how people learn by observing others. It's not just about rewards and punishments, but also about imitation and modeling. So, for example, a child might learn to behave a certain way by watching someone else and imitating them.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A says behaviorism is about human emotions as the primary factor, which doesn't sound right because behaviorism focuses on observable behavior, not internal emotions. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: Behaviorism refers to only observable behavior, and social learning theory is about children imitating and includes dependency as a major factor. That sounds closer. Behaviorism is about observable behavior, and social learning does involve imitation and social factors. So B might be correct.

Option C suggests social learning is a subset of behaviorism dealing with verbal learning. I'm not sure about that. Social learning theory is broader and includes things like observational learning, not just a subset of behaviorism.

Option D says social learning is solely about aggression. No, that's too narrow. Social learning covers a lot more than just aggression.

Option E: Behaviorism is about supernatural influences, and social learning is about societal norms. That doesn't fit because behaviorism isn't really about the supernatural; it's more about external factors and conditioning.

Option F: Behaviorism is concerned with unobservable mental processes. No, that's the opposite of behaviorism, which focuses on observable behaviors.

Option G: Social learning is about peer pressure, and behaviorism is about conscious decisions. I don't think that's accurate. Behaviorism is more about external stimuli and responses, not so much about peer pressure or conscious decisions.

Option H: Both theories argue behavior is shaped by divine will. That doesn't make sense; both are scientific theories focused on environmental and learning factors, not divine influence.

Option I: Behaviorism based on past experiences, social learning on genetics. Wait, social learning theory is about learning through observation, not genetics. Behaviorism is about past experiences (like conditioning), but social learning isn't solely genetic. So I might not be correct.

Option J: Behaviorism believes in intrinsic factors. Intrinsic factors would be internal, like emotions or thoughts. Behaviorism is more about external, so J is wrong.

So going back, the best fit is Option B. It correctly describes behaviorism as focusing on observable behavior and social learning theory as involving imitation and social factors.

The correct answer is B. Behaviorism focuses on observable behavior, while social learning theory emphasizes imitation and social factors.

Answer: B
