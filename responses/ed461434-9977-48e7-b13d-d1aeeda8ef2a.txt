Okay, so I have this question about Velleman's stance on who should decide whether a patient receives euthanasia. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that euthanasia is a controversial issue, and different philosophers have different opinions. The question is specifically about Velleman's view. I think Velleman is a contemporary philosopher, maybe from the US, and he's written about euthanasia and other ethical issues.

I recall that some philosophers argue that the decision should be left to the patient, emphasizing autonomy. Others might say that doctors or family should have a say, especially if the patient can't make the decision themselves. There's also the angle of whether it's a legal or medical decision, which would point towards options like a court, hospital admin, or ethics committee.

Wait, I think Velleman is against euthanasia. Or maybe he's against assisted suicide? I'm not entirely sure. If he's against it, he might argue that it shouldn't be allowed at all, which would point to option C. But I'm not 100% certain.

Alternatively, if he thinks it's permissible under certain conditions, he might say it's the patient's choice. So, in that case, the answer would be J, the patient. But I'm a bit confused because I think he's more on the side of opposing euthanasia.

Wait, another thought: Velleman might argue that the decision should be made by the patient themselves, respecting their autonomy, even if he personally is against the practice. So maybe the patient should decide if they're capable.

I'm a bit torn. Let me try to remember any specific arguments he's made. I think he's discussed the idea that patients have the right to refuse treatment, which relates to autonomy. So, if a patient wants euthanasia, and they're competent, perhaps he would support that, making the answer J.

But then again, in some contexts, he might caution against it, thinking it's a slippery slope. But the question is about who should decide, not whether it's right or wrong. So, if he's emphasizing patient autonomy, it's J. If he's against it in general, it's C.

I'm going to go with the patient, so the answer is J.
