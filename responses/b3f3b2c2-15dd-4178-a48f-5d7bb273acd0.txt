Okay, so I've got this problem here about mixing iron and water. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says a piece of iron weighing 20.0 grams at 95.0°C is placed into 100.0 grams of water at 25.0°C. We need to find the resulting temperature when they reach thermal equilibrium, assuming no heat is lost to the surroundings. The specific heats are given: iron is 0.108 cal/g°C and water is 1.0 cal/g°C.

Wait, I remember that when two substances are mixed, the heat lost by the hotter one equals the heat gained by the cooler one. So, the heat lost by iron should equal the heat gained by water. But wait, wait. Iron is hotter, so it loses heat, and water gains heat. So the formula should be: mass_iron * specific_heat_iron * (T_initial_iron - T_final) = mass_water * specific_heat_water * (T_final - T_initial_water). Yeah, that makes sense because the temperature final will be somewhere between 25 and 95.

Let me write down the variables to keep track:

Mass of iron (m_iron) = 20.0 g
Initial temp of iron (T_iron_initial) = 95.0°C
Mass of water (m_water) = 100.0 g
Initial temp of water (T_water_initial) = 25.0°C
Specific heat of iron (c_iron) = 0.108 cal/g°C
Specific heat of water (c_water) = 1.0 cal/g°C
Final temp (T_final) = ?

So the equation is:

m_iron * c_iron * (T_iron_initial - T_final) = m_water * c_water * (T_final - T_water_initial)

Plugging the numbers in:

20.0 g * 0.108 cal/g°C * (95.0 - T_final) = 100.0 g * 1.0 cal/g°C * (T_final -25.0)

Let me compute the left side first. 20 * 0.108 is 2.16. So left side becomes 2.16*(95 - T_f).

Right side: 100 * 1.0 is 100, so right side is 100*(T_f -25).

So expanding both sides:

2.16*(95 - T_f) = 100*(T_f -25)

Let me compute 2.16*95. 95 * 2 is 190, 95 *0.16 is 15.2, so total is 205.2. So left side is 205.2 - 2.16 T_f.

Right side is 100 T_f - 2500.

So putting it together:

205.2 - 2.16 T_f = 100 T_f - 2500

I'll bring all terms to one side. Let's add 2.16 T_f to both sides and add 2500 to both sides:

205.2 + 2500 = 100 T_f + 2.16 T_f

That's 2705.2 = 102.16 T_f

Wait, 100 + 2.16 is 102.16. So T_f = 2705.2 / 102.16.

Let me compute that. Hmm, 102.16 times 26 is about 2656.16. 2705.2 - 2656.16 is 49.04. So 26.48? Let me check 102.16 * 26.48. Let me compute 102.16 * 26 = 2656.16, 102.16 *0.48= approx 49.0368. So total is 2656.16 +49.0368 = 2705.1968, which is close to 2705.2. So T_final is approximately 26.48°C.

Wait, but looking at the options, E is 26.48°C. So the answer must be E.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I should redo the equation.

Wait, the initial equation was:

20 * 0.108 * (95 - T) = 100 *1.0*(T -25)

Which is 2.16*(95 - T) = 100*(T -25)

Expanding:

2.16 *95 = 205.2, 2.16*(-T) = -2.16T

Right side: 100T - 2500.

So equation becomes:

205.2 -2.16T = 100T -2500

Bring all terms to left:

205.2 +2500 =100T +2.16T → 2705.2 =102.16T → T=2705.2 /102.16.

Let me compute that division more accurately. 102.16 × 26 = 2656.16. Subtract from 2705.2: 2705.2 -2656.16=49.04.

So now, 49.04 /102.16 ≈ 0.480.

So T=26.48°C. So yes, the answer is E.

The problem involves calculating the final temperature when 20.0 g of iron at 95.0°C is placed in 100.0 g of water at 25.0°C, assuming no heat loss. Using the principle of conservation of energy, the heat lost by the iron equals the heat gained by the water. The specific heats of iron and water are 0.108 cal/g°C and 1.0 cal/g°C, respectively.

The equation used is:

\[
m_{\text{iron}} \cdot c_{\text{iron}} \cdot (T_{\text{iron\_initial}} - T_{\text{final}}) = m_{\text{water}} \cdot c_{\text{water}} \cdot (T_{\text{final}} - T_{\text{water\_initial}})
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
20.0 \cdot 0.108 \cdot (95.0 - T_{\text{final}}) = 100.0 \cdot 1.0 \cdot (T_{\text{final}} - 25.0)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
2.16 \cdot (95.0 - T_{\text{final}}) = 100.0 \cdot (T_{\text{final}} - 25.0)
\]

Expanding both sides:

\[
205.2 - 2.16T_{\text{final}} = 100T_{\text{final}} - 2500
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
2705.2 = 102.16T_{\text{final}}
\]

Solving for \( T_{\text{final}} \):

\[
T_{\text{final}} \approx 26.48^\circ \text{C}
\]

Thus, the final temperature is approximately 26.48°C, corresponding to option E.
