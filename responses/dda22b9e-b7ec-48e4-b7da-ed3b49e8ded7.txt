Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electromagnetic waves. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand. It says that an electromagnetic wave of 40 kHz is radiated by an antenna, and I need to find the time it takes to reach a point 60 km away. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, wait, 40 kHz seems a bit low for electromagnetic waves. I remember that radio waves are in the range of kHz to GHz, so maybe that's okay. But wait, 40 kHz is actually in the Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) range. ELF waves have frequencies below 3 kHz, but 40 is higher than that. Anyway, maybe it's a typo, but for the sake of the problem, I'll go with 40 kHz.

So, the wave is traveling in the air, right? The speed of an electromagnetic wave in a vacuum is the speed of light, c, which is approximately 3 x 10^8 meters per second. But wait, when it's in a medium like air, does the speed change? I think so. The speed of light in air is slightly less than in a vacuum, but for most problems, especially in exams, they often approximate it as the speed of light in a vacuum. So I'll assume c here.

The formula I need is time = distance / speed. Time (t) = distance (d) / speed (v). 

Distance is given as 60 km. Let me convert that to meters because the speed is in meters per second. 60 km is 60,000 meters.

So plugging in the numbers: t = 60,000 m / (3 x 10^8 m/s). Let me calculate that. 

3 x 10^8 is 300,000,000. 

So 60,000 divided by 300,000,000. Let me do the division: 60,000 / 300,000,000. 

Wait, 60,000 is 6 x 10^4, and 300,000,000 is 3 x 10^8. So dividing those exponents: 10^4 / 10^8 = 10^-4. 

Then 6 divided by 3 is 2. So 2 x 10^-4 seconds. 

Wait, 2e-4 seconds is the same as 0.0002 seconds. I need to convert that into milliseconds because the options are in msec. 

1 second is 1000 milliseconds, so 0.0002 seconds is 0.2 milliseconds. 

Looking at the options, F is 0.2 msec. So the answer should be F.

But wait, did I make any mistakes? Let me double-check.

Wait, the frequency given is 40 kHz. Does the frequency affect the time it takes to reach a point? Oh wait, no, because the time depends only on the speed of the wave and the distance. The frequency is related to the wavelength, but not directly to the time taken for the wave to travel a certain distance. So my calculation should be correct regardless of the frequency.

So yeah, the time is 0.2 milliseconds, which is option F.

The time taken is calculated by dividing the distance (60 km or 60,000 meters) by the speed of the wave (assumed to be the speed of light, \(3 \times 10^8\) m/s). This gives \(60,000 \, \text{m} / 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} = 2 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{s} = 0.2 \, \text{msec}\). 

Answer: F
