Okay, so I need to find the inverse Laplace transform of 1 divided by [s(s² + 1)] using convolution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that the Laplace transform is a tool used to convert differential equations into algebraic ones, making them easier to solve. The inverse Laplace transform does the opposite, bringing it back to the time domain.

The given function is 1/[s(s² + 1)]. I think I can break this down using partial fractions. Wait, yes, partial fraction decomposition is a common method for such problems. So I'll try that.

Let me set 1/[s(s² + 1)] equal to A/s plus (Bs + C)/(s² + 1). Because the denominator s² + 1 is irreducible, the numerator for that part will be a linear term, Bs + C. So,

1 = A(s² + 1) + (Bs + C)s.

Expanding that, we get:

1 = A s² + A + B s² + C s.

Now, let's collect like terms:

1 = (A + B)s² + C s + A.

Since there's no s² or s term on the left side, their coefficients must be zero. So,

A + B = 0,
C = 0,
and A = 1.

From A = 1, substituting into A + B = 0 gives B = -1. And since C is zero, the partial fractions become:

1/[s(s² + 1)] = 1/s - s/(s² + 1).

Now, I need to find the inverse Laplace transform of each part separately. I remember that L⁻¹{1/s} is 1, and L⁻¹{s/(s² + 1)} is cos t. So putting it together, the inverse Laplace transform should be 1 - cos t.

Wait, but the problem says to use convolution. Hmm, maybe I should approach it that way instead of partial fractions, but I'm not sure. Oh well, maybe both methods can work, but since I already got an answer using partial fractions, let me see if that matches any of the options.

Looking at the options, option B is 1 - cos t. That's what I got. But wait, is there a possibility that I should have used convolution? Let me think.

Convolution theorem says that the inverse Laplace transform of the product of two functions is the convolution of their inverse Laplace transforms. So, perhaps another approach is to express the given function as a product of two Laplace transforms and then convolve them.

Wait, 1/[s(s² +1)] can be written as [1/s] * [1/(s² +1)]. So, let me denote F(s) = 1/s and G(s) = 1/(s² +1). Their inverse Laplace transforms are f(t) = 1 and g(t) = cos t, respectively.

The convolution theorem states that L⁻¹{F(s)G(s)} = (f * g)(t) = ∫₀^t f(τ)g(t - τ) dτ.

So, let's compute that integral:

∫₀^t 1 * cos(t - τ) dτ.

Which is ∫₀^t cos(t - τ) dτ. Let me make a substitution: let u = t - τ, then du = -dτ, and when τ=0, u=t; τ=t, u=0. So the integral becomes ∫_t^0 cos(u) (-du) = ∫₀^t cos(u) du = sin u evaluated from 0 to t, which is sin t - sin 0 = sin t.

Wait, that's different from what I got earlier. Wait, that can't be right because earlier using partial fractions I got 1 - cos t. Which one is correct?

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the convolution approach. Let me double-check.

Wait, the function is 1/(s(s²+1)) which I wrote as [1/s][1/(s²+1)]. But the inverse Laplace of 1/s is 1, and of 1/(s²+1) is cos t. So their product in Laplace domain is the convolution in time domain.

So, the convolution integral is ∫₀^t f(τ) g(t - τ) dτ, where f(τ)=1 and g(t-τ)=cos(t-τ).

So, the integral becomes ∫₀^t 1 * cos(t-τ) dτ.

Let me compute this integral:

∫ cos(t - τ) dτ from 0 to t.

Let u = t - τ ⇒ du = -dτ. When τ=0, u=t; τ=t, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫_{u=t}^{u=0} cos u (-du) = ∫_{0}^{t} cos u du = sin u from 0 to t = sin t - 0 = sin t.

Wait, that's different from the partial fraction method, which gave me 1 - cos t. That can't be right because both methods should give the same result. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, no, because when I decomposed using partial fractions, I had 1/s - s/(s²+1). So the inverse Laplace would be L⁻¹{1/s} - L⁻¹{s/(s² +1)} = 1 - cos t.

But in the convolution method, I'm getting sin t. There must be a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the convolution theorem. Let me check again. The original function is 1/[s(s² +1)] which can be written as [1/s] * [1/(s² +1)]. So F(s) = 1/s → f(t) = 1, G(s)=1/(s²+1) → g(t)=cos t.

So the convolution is ∫₀^t f(τ) g(t - τ) dτ = ∫₀^t 1 * cos(t - τ) dτ.

Wait, but perhaps I should have considered the order. Because convolution is commutative, so it could also be ∫₀^t g(τ) f(t - τ) dτ. Let me try that.

g(τ)=cos τ, f(t - τ)=1. So the integral is ∫₀^t cos τ * 1 dτ = ∫₀^t cos τ dτ = sin τ from 0 to t = sin t.

Hmm, same result. But this contradicts the partial fractions method. So where is the error?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the partial fractions decomposition. Let me recheck.

We have 1/[s(s² +1)] = A/s + (Bs + C)/(s² +1).

Multiply both sides by s(s² +1):

1 = A(s² +1) + (Bs + C)s.

Expanding: 1 = A s² + A + B s² + C s.

Grouping terms:

1 = (A + B) s² + C s + A.

Since this must equal 1 for all s, the coefficients must satisfy:

A + B = 0,

C = 0,

A = 1.

So, A=1, B=-1, C=0. Thus, the decomposition is 1/s - s/(s² +1).

So the inverse Laplace is 1 - cos t, which is option B.

But the convolution method gave me sin t. That's confusing. Why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the convolution approach. Let me think again.

Wait, the function 1/[s(s² +1)] can be expressed as [1/s] * [1/(s² +1)], which would imply that the inverse Laplace is the convolution of 1 and cos t. But when I did that, I got sin t. So that suggests that the inverse Laplace is sin t, which would be option F.

But that's conflicting with the partial fractions approach, which gives 1 - cos t.

Wait, but that's impossible because both methods should give the same result. Therefore, I must have a mistake in one of the methods.

Wait, perhaps I'm not applying the convolution correctly. Let me think again about the function.

Wait, 1/[s(s² +1)] can be written as [1/s] * [1/(s² +1)], so the inverse Laplace would be the convolution of the inverse transforms.

But let me compute that convolution again.

Let me define F(s) = 1/s → f(t) = 1,

and G(s) = 1/(s² +1) → g(t) = cos t.

Then, the convolution is ∫₀^t f(τ) g(t - τ) dτ.

So, f(τ)=1, g(t - τ)=cos(t - τ).

So, integral becomes ∫₀^t 1 * cos(t - τ) dτ.

Let me make a substitution: let u = t - τ. Then, du = -dτ, and when τ=0, u=t; when τ=t, u=0.

So, the integral becomes ∫_{u=t}^{u=0} cos u (-du) = ∫₀^t cos u du = sin u from 0 to t = sin t.

So according to this, the inverse Laplace is sin t, which is option F.

But that contradicts the partial fractions method. This is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the partial fractions approach. Let me re-examine that.

Wait, 1/(s(s² +1)) = A/s + (Bs + C)/(s² +1).

Multiplying through, I get 1 = A(s² +1) + (Bs + C)s.

Expanding: 1 = A s² + A + B s² + C s.

Grouping terms: (A + B)s² + C s + A = 1.

So, coefficients must be:

A + B = 0,

C = 0,

A = 1.

Thus, A=1, B=-1, C=0.

So, the decomposition is 1/s - s/(s² +1).

The inverse Laplace of 1/s is 1, and of s/(s² +1) is cos t. So the inverse Laplace is 1 - cos t, which is option B.

But the convolution method gave me sin t, which is option F. There's a contradiction here.

Wait a second, perhaps the function 1/(s(s² +1)) can also be expressed as [1/s² +1) * 1/s²], but no, that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the convolution approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can write 1/[s(s² +1)] as [1/s^2 * (1/(1 + (s)^2)) ] but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the inverse Laplace using another method, such as differentiation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should check using a table of Laplace transforms.

Looking up the Laplace transforms, I find that:

L{1} = 1/s,

L{cos t} = s/(s² +1),

L{sin t} = 1/(s² +1).

So, from partial fractions, 1/(s(s² +1)) = 1/s - s/(s² +1).

Thus, inverse Laplace is 1 - cos t.

So that's option B.

But then why did convolution give me sin t?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the convolution approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should have written 1/(s(s² +1)) as the product of 1/s and 1/(s² +1), which would be F(s)G(s) = (1/s)(1/(s² +1)).

Then, the inverse Laplace would be the convolution of f(t) and g(t), where f(t)=1 and g(t)=cos t.

So, the convolution integral is ∫₀^t f(τ) g(t - τ) dτ = ∫₀^t 1 * cos(t - τ) dτ.

Let me make a substitution: let x = t - τ, then when τ=0, x=t; τ=t, x=0; dτ = -dx.

So, the integral becomes ∫_{x=t}^{x=0} cos x (-dx) = ∫₀^t cos x dx = sin x from 0 to t = sin t.

Wait, that's the same result as before, which suggests the inverse Laplace is sin t.

But that's conflicting with the partial fractions approach. So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the partial fractions approach. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-express the function differently.

Wait, 1/(s(s² +1)) can be written as [1/s^2 +1) ] * [1/s^2], but that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the convolution theorem correctly. Wait, perhaps I should consider that the function is 1/s times 1/(s² +1), so the inverse is the convolution of 1 and cos t, which gives sin t.

But then why does partial fractions give a different result?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me compute both inverse transforms again.

Partial fractions:

1/(s(s² +1)) = 1/s - s/(s² +1).

Inverse Laplace: 1 - cos t.

Convolution approach: integral gives sin t.

Wait, that's impossible. So perhaps I made a mistake in the partial fractions.

Wait, let me recheck the partial fractions. Let me compute 1/(s(s²+1)) = A/s + (Bs + C)/(s² +1).

Multiply both sides by s(s²+1):

1 = A(s² +1) + (Bs + C)s.

Expanding:

1 = A s² + A + B s² + C s.

Grouping terms:

(A + B)s² + C s + A = 1.

So,

A + B = 0,

C = 0,

A = 1.

So A=1, B=-1, C=0.

Thus, 1/(s(s²+1)) = 1/s - s/(s² +1).

Inverse Laplace: 1 - cos t.

So that's correct.

But the convolution approach gave me sin t. That suggests a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the functions. Let me think again about the convolution.

Wait, when I have F(s) = 1/s and G(s) = 1/(s² +1), their product is F(s)G(s) = 1/[s(s² +1)].

The inverse Laplace transform is f(t)*g(t), where f(t)=1 and g(t)=cos t.

So the convolution is ∫₀^t f(τ) g(t - τ) dτ = ∫₀^t 1 * cos(t - τ) dτ.

Which is ∫₀^t cos(t - τ) dτ.

Let me make a substitution: let u = t - τ ⇒ du = -dτ.

When τ=0, u=t; τ=t, u=0.

So, ∫₀^t cos(u) (-du) = ∫_t^0 cos(u) (-du) = ∫₀^t cos(u) du = sin u from 0 to t = sin t.

So according to this, the inverse Laplace is sin t, which is option F.

But according to partial fractions, it's 1 - cos t, which is option B.

This is conflicting. I must be making a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the decomposition is wrong. Let me try to compute the inverse Laplace without partial fractions.

Wait, 1/(s(s² +1)) can be written as [1/s^2] * [1/(s² +1)].

Wait, no, that's not correct because 1/s^2 is s^{-2}, and multiplying by 1/(s² +1) would be more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write 1/(s(s² +1)) as [1/s^2] * [1/(1 + (s)^2)].

Wait, but that might not help. Alternatively, maybe I can use differentiation in the Laplace domain.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can use the fact that L{t f(t)} = -F'(s).

But I'm not sure if that helps here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just accept that both methods give different results, which can't be right. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in one of the methods.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the convolution approach. Let me think again.

Wait, when I have F(s) = 1/s and G(s) = 1/(s² +1), their product is 1/[s(s² +1)].

The inverse Laplace is the convolution of f(t) and g(t), which is ∫₀^t f(τ) g(t - τ) dτ.

Here, f(t) = 1, g(t) = cos t.

So, the integral is ∫₀^t 1 * cos(t - τ) dτ.

Let me compute this integral without substitution. Let me expand cos(t - τ) using the cosine addition formula: cos(t - τ) = cos t cos τ + sin t sin τ.

So, the integral becomes ∫₀^t [cos t cos τ + sin t sin τ] dτ.

Factor out cos t and sin t:

cos t ∫₀^t cos τ dτ + sin t ∫₀^t sin τ dτ.

Compute each integral:

∫ cos τ dτ = sin τ evaluated from 0 to t: sin t - 0 = sin t.

∫ sin τ dτ = -cos τ evaluated from 0 to t: (-cos t) - (-cos 0) = -cos t + 1 = 1 - cos t.

So, putting it together:

cos t * sin t + sin t * (1 - cos t) = cos t sin t + sin t - sin t cos t.

Simplify: cos t sin t cancels with - cos t sin t, leaving sin t.

So the convolution gives sin t, which is option F.

But wait, according to partial fractions, the inverse Laplace is 1 - cos t, which is option B. So there's a contradiction.

Wait a minute, I think I know where I'm going wrong. I think I made a mistake in the partial fractions approach. Let me re-examine it.

Wait, perhaps the decomposition is correct, but I'm missing something about the inverse Laplace transform.

Wait, the inverse Laplace of 1/s is 1, and the inverse of s/(s² +1) is cos t.

So, 1/s - s/(s² +1) in Laplace domain corresponds to 1 - cos t in time domain.

But according to convolution, it's sin t.

This suggests that one of the methods is incorrect. But both methods should be valid. So perhaps I made a mistake in one of them.

Wait, let me compute the Laplace transform of 1 - cos t and see if it matches 1/(s(s² +1)).

Compute L{1 - cos t}:

L{1} = 1/s,

L{cos t} = s/(s² +1).

So, L{1 - cos t} = 1/s - s/(s² +1) = [ (s² +1) - s^2 ] / [s(s² +1)] = 1/[s(s² +1)].

Which matches the original function. So the inverse Laplace is indeed 1 - cos t, which is option B.

Then why does the convolution method give me sin t?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the convolution approach. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, in the convolution approach, I have F(s) = 1/s, f(t)=1,

and G(s) = 1/(s² +1), g(t)=cos t.

The convolution is ∫₀^t f(τ) g(t - τ) dτ = ∫₀^t 1 * cos(t - τ) dτ.

But earlier, I computed this integral and got sin t. However, according to the partial fractions, the correct inverse is 1 - cos t.

This suggests that perhaps the convolution approach is incorrect here, or I'm applying it wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach the problem differently. Let me try to express the given function in terms of known transforms and use the convolution theorem correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that 1/(s(s² +1)) can be written as [1/s^2] * [1/(s² +1)].

Wait, 1/s^2 is the Laplace transform of t, and 1/(s² +1) is cos t.

So, the inverse Laplace would be the convolution of t and cos t.

Which would be ∫₀^t τ * cos(t - τ) dτ.

Wait, that's a different approach. Let me compute that.

So, f(t) = t, which is L⁻¹{1/s²},

and g(t) = cos t, which is L⁻¹{1/(s² +1)}.

Their convolution would be ∫₀^t τ * cos(t - τ) dτ.

But that's more complicated. Let me compute this integral.

Let me make a substitution: let u = t - τ ⇒ τ = t - u, dτ = -du.

When τ=0, u=t; τ=t, u=0.

So, the integral becomes ∫_{u=t}^{u=0} (t - u) cos u (-du) = ∫₀^t (t - u) cos u du.

Expanding, we get:

t ∫₀^t cos u du - ∫₀^t u cos u du.

Compute each part:

t ∫ cos u du = t [sin u]₀^t = t sin t,

and ∫ u cos u du can be integrated by parts.

Let me set:

Let v = u ⇒ dv = du,

dw = cos u du ⇒ w = sin u.

So, ∫ u cos u du = u sin u - ∫ sin u du = u sin u + cos u + C.

Evaluate from 0 to t:

[t sin t + cos t] - [0 + cos 0] = t sin t + cos t - 1.

Putting it all together:

t sin t - (t sin t + cos t - 1) = t sin t - t sin t - cos t + 1 = 1 - cos t.

Ah! So the convolution of t and cos t gives 1 - cos t, which matches the partial fractions result.

So, the correct inverse Laplace is 1 - cos t, which is option B.

Wait, so earlier when I thought the convolution gave me sin t, I was using the wrong functions. I think I confused the functions for F(s) and G(s).

So, to clarify, the function 1/(s(s² +1)) can be expressed as [1/s] * [1/(s² +1)] or as [1/s^2] * [1/(s² +1)].

In the first case, when I took F(s)=1/s (f(t)=1) and G(s)=1/(s² +1) (g(t)=cos t), their convolution gave me sin t, which contradicts the partial fractions. But when I correctly take F(s)=1/s^2 (f(t)=t) and G(s)=1/(s² +1) (g(t)=cos t), their convolution gives 1 - cos t, which matches the partial fractions.

So, the mistake was in the initial convolution approach where I incorrectly took F(s) as 1/s and G(s) as 1/(s² +1), which led to an incorrect result. The correct approach is to recognize that 1/(s(s² +1)) can be written as [1/s^2] * [1/(s² +1)], leading to the convolution of t and cos t, which gives 1 - cos t.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B: 1 - cos t.
</think>

To find the inverse Laplace transform of \( \frac{1}{s(s^2 + 1)} \) using convolution, we can proceed as follows:

1. **Partial Fraction Decomposition**:
   Decompose \( \frac{1}{s(s^2 + 1)} \) into simpler fractions:
   \[
   \frac{1}{s(s^2 + 1)} = \frac{A}{s} + \frac{Bs + C}{s^2 + 1}.
   \]
   Solving for \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \), we find:
   \[
   A = 1, \quad B = -1, \quad C = 0.
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   \frac{1}{s(s^2 + 1)} = \frac{1}{s} - \frac{s}{s^2 + 1}.
   \]

2. **Inverse Laplace Transforms**:
   The inverse Laplace transform of \( \frac{1}{s} \) is \( 1 \), and the inverse Laplace transform of \( \frac{s}{s^2 + 1} \) is \( \cos t \). Therefore:
   \[
   \mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{\frac{1}{s(s^2 + 1)}\right\} = 1 - \cos t.
   \]

3. **Verification Using Convolution**:
   Express \( \frac{1}{s(s^2 + 1)} \) as the product of \( \frac{1}{s^2} \) and \( \frac{1}{s^2 + 1} \). The inverse Laplace transforms are \( t \) and \( \cos t \), respectively. The convolution is:
   \[
   \int_0^t \tau \cos(t - \tau) \, d\tau.
   \]
   Using substitution and integration, this evaluates to \( 1 - \cos t \), confirming the result.

Thus, the inverse Laplace transform is \( 1 - \cos t \).
