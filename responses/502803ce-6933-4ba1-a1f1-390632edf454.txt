Okay, so I have this question about the percentage of children aged 13-15 in China who reported being in a physical fight at school one or more times in the past 12 months as of 2015. The options are from A to J, with various percentages.

Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct. I'm not exactly sure about the exact number, but I can try to think through it. First, I remember that school violence is a topic that's been discussed in China, especially regarding younger students. I think the rates might be lower than in some other countries, but I'm not certain.

Let me consider the options: 89% seems really high, like almost all kids. That's probably too high for most countries, so maybe not A. 9% is quite low; I wonder if it's that low. 29% is option C, which is almost a third. That seems plausible. 69% is D, which is almost 70%, also seems high. E is 19%, F is 39%, G is 59%, H is 49%, I is 79%, and J is 99%.

I think I've heard somewhere that around 20-30% of students in that age group have experienced physical fights. So options E (19%) and C (29%) are close. Maybe 29% is more accurate. Or perhaps it's even lower, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I recall a study or a report stating that about a third of students in China in that age range had been involved in a physical fight. So that would point towards option C, 29%. Alternatively, I might be mixing it up with bullying statistics, so I should be careful.

Another angle: school fights are often reported in surveys. Maybe the percentage is around 20-30%. If 29% is the closest, that's probably the answer. Alternatively, some sources might say it's lower, like 19%, but I'm more confident in the higher end of that range.

So, after thinking, I'll go with C: 29%.
