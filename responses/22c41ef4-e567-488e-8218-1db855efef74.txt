Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me take it slow because I'm not super confident with all the conversions yet.

The problem says an electric motor is used to lift a 1600-lb block at a rate of 10 feet per minute. We need to find out how much electric power in watts must be supplied to the motor, considering it's 60% efficient. Hmm, okay.

First, I remember that power is generally calculated as work done over time. So, I'll probably need to find the work done and then divide by the time. But since the question is about power, maybe I can approach it using the formula Power = Force × Velocity. Wait, but I also have to account for efficiency.

Wait, the motor is only 60% efficient. That means the power supplied to the motor (input power) is higher than the power used to do the work (output power). So, the output power is the useful power, and the input power is higher by a factor of 1/efficiency.

Let me break it down:

1. Calculate the work done per unit time (which is power) to lift the block.
2. Adjust for the motor's efficiency to find the required input power.

So, the force here is the weight of the block, which is 1600 lb. But wait, I think I need to convert pounds to newtons because the standard unit for force in the metric system is newtons, and power in watts uses joules, which are N·m. 

I remember that 1 pound is approximately 4.44822 newtons. So, 1600 lb × 4.44822 N/lb = let's calculate that. 1600 × 4.44822 = 7117.152 N. So the force is about 7117.152 N.

Next, the velocity is given as 10 feet per minute. I need to convert that to meters per second because the standard unit for velocity in power calculations is m/s.

I recall that 1 foot is 0.3048 meters, and 1 minute is 60 seconds. So, 10 ft/min = 10 × 0.3048 m / 60 s. Let me compute that: 10 * 0.3048 = 3.048 m per minute, then divided by 60 gives 0.0508 m/s.

Now, the power required to lift the block at that velocity is Force × Velocity. So, 7117.152 N × 0.0508 m/s = let's calculate that. 

7117.152 * 0.0508 ≈ 7117.152 * 0.05 is about 355.858, and 7117.152 * 0.0008 is about 5.6937. Adding them: 355.858 + 5.6937 ≈ 361.5517 watts. Wait, but that's the power without considering efficiency.

Wait, actually, no. Because the motor is only 60% efficient, the power supplied (input) must be higher. So the output power is 361.5517 W, but the input power is output divided by efficiency. So, 361.5517 W / 0.6 ≈ 602.586 W. Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see 602. Let me check my calculations because maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I messed up the units somewhere. Let me go back step by step.

First, converting the weight from pounds to newtons: 1600 lb × 4.44822 N/lb. Let me double-check that. 1600 × 4.44822 = 7117.152 N. That seems right.

Velocity: 10 fpm. Converting to m/s: 10 ft/min × 0.3048 m/ft = 3.048 m/min. Divided by 60 s/min gives 0.0508 m/s. That seems correct.

Power (output) is F × v = 7117.152 N × 0.0508 m/s. Let me calculate that again. 7117.152 * 0.0508:

Let me compute 7117.152 × 0.05 = 355.8576. Then 7117.152 × 0.0008 = 5.6937216. Adding them together: 355.8576 + 5.6937216 ≈ 361.5513 W. So that's the output power.

Since the motor is 60% efficient, the input power needed is 361.5513 / 0.6 ≈ 602.5855 W.

Looking at the options, I don't see 602.5855. The closest option is I: 605 watts. But wait, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, maybe I should use more precise numbers. Let me try the velocity calculation again.

10 fpm = 10 ft/min. 1 ft = 0.3048 m, so 10 ft = 3.048 m. So per minute, it's 3.048 m per 60 seconds, which is 0.0508 m/s. That's correct.

So, the output power is indeed around 361.55 W. But the motor's efficiency is 60%, so input power is 361.55 / 0.6 = 602.58 W. Hmm, none of the options match exactly. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: 1000
B:950
C:1200
D:750
E:450
F:267
G:1600
H:350
I:605
J:0.81

Wait, I:605 is close to 602.58. Maybe rounding is involved. So perhaps the correct answer is I:605 watts.

Wait, but another thought: Did I correctly account for the units somewhere? Let me check if I converted lb to kg first and then to newtons. Wait, no, I directly converted lb to newtons, which is correct. Alternatively, sometimes people convert lb to kg and then multiply by g to get newtons. Let's try that approach to confirm.

1600 lb is equal to 1600 / 2.20462 kg ≈ 725.925 kg. Then, weight in newtons is mass × g, where g = 9.81 m/s². So 725.925 kg × 9.81 ≈ 7117.15 N. Same as before. So that's consistent.

So, the power calculation seems correct. So, input power is about 602.58 W, which rounds to 605 W, option I.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the electric power required to lift a 1600-lb block at 10 fpm using a 60% efficient motor. The steps are as follows:

1. Convert the weight from pounds to newtons:  
   \( 1600 \, \text{lb} \times 4.44822 \, \text{N/lb} = 7117.152 \, \text{N} \).

2. Convert the velocity from feet per minute to meters per second:  
   \( 10 \, \text{fpm} \times 0.3048 \, \text{m/ft} \div 60 \, \text{s/min} = 0.0508 \, \text{m/s} \).

3. Calculate the output power (force × velocity):  
   \( 7117.152 \, \text{N} \times 0.0508 \, \text{m/s} = 361.5513 \, \text{W} \).

4. Adjust for motor efficiency to find the input power:  
   \( \frac{361.5513 \, \text{W}}{0.6} = 602.5855 \, \text{W} \).

Rounding to the nearest option, the closest match is **605 W**.
