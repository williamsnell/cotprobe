Question:

A homeowner gave his friend a mortgage on his property to secure a loan from the friend to the homeowner in the amount of $100,000. The homeowner then gives an investor a mortgage on the property to secure a loan from the investor to the homeowner in the amount of $80,000. The friend then records his mortgage. The homeowner then gives a bank a mortgage on the property to secure a loan from the bank to the homeowner in the amount of $50,000. The investor then records. The bank then records. The homeowner lost his job and was unable to pay the mortgages on the property. In a foreclosure proceeding in which the friend, the investor, and the bank were parties, the property sold for $160,000. The recording statute in this jurisdiction provided "unless recorded, all written instruments affecting title to land are void as to subsequent purchasers who paid value and without notice. "What dollar amount, if any, should go to the friend?

Options:

A: $100,000. 00
B: $90,000.00
C: $160,000.00
D: $0. 00
E: $70,000.00
F: $60,000.00
G: $20,000.00
H: $50,000.00
I: $80,000. 00

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about mortgages and recording statutes. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll do my best.

Alright, the scenario is that a homeowner took out three different mortgages on his property. The first was from a friend for $100,000. Then, he gave an investor a mortgage for $80,000. The friend recorded his mortgage first. After that, he got a bank loan of $50,000, and the investor recorded theirs. Finally, the bank recorded theirs. So the recording order is friend first, then investor, then bank.

The homeowner then couldn't pay, and the property was foreclosed on, selling for $160,000. The question is, how much does the friend get?

The recording statute here says, "unless recorded, all written instruments affecting title to land are void as to subsequent purchasers who paid value and without notice." So this is a notice-race statute, I think. Because it mentions subsequent purchasers who paid value and without notice. So, in this case, the first to record has priority, but only against those who come after and are bona fide purchasers (BFPs).

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The statute says that if it's not recorded, it's void as to subsequent purchasers who paid value and without notice. So, if a later purchaser (BFP) comes in without notice and pays value, then the unrecorded instrument is void against them. But if someone records first, then their interest is protected against later purchasers.

So, the order of recording is friend, then investor, then bank. So friend recorded first, so their mortgage is first in line. Investor recorded second, so their mortgage is second. Bank recorded third, so their mortgage is third.

But the question is about the proceeds from the foreclosure sale, which is $160,000. The proceeds would go to the mortgagees in the order of their priority. So the first mortgage gets paid first, then the second, then the third, with any remaining money going to the homeowner.

But wait, the friend's mortgage was first, right? Because they recorded first. So the friend's $100k would be paid first, then the investor's $80k, then the bank's $50k. But the total is $230k, which is more than the sale price of $160k. So there's not enough to pay all three in full.

So, how does this work? The proceeds are distributed in the order of priority. The first mortgage (friend) gets paid first up to their $100k. The remaining $60k (160-100=60) goes to the second mortgage (investor). But the investor's mortgage is $80k, so they get $60k, and the bank's $50k is next. But after the investor gets their $60k, the bank's $50k is still only partially covered, but since the total proceeds are $160k, the remaining $10k (after 100+60=160) would go to the bank, but wait, no, because the bank's $50k is more than what's left. So the bank would get only the remaining $0 after the first two are paid. Wait, no, let me recalculate.

Wait, the friend is first, so they get $100k. Then the investor is next, so they get the next $60k (since 160-100=60). The investor's loan was $80k, so they get $60k, which is less than their loan. The bank is third, so they get the remaining $0 because 100+60=160, so nothing left. But that can't be right because the bank's loan is $50k, so maybe the bank would get $50k, but since there's only $160k, the friend gets $100k, the investor gets $60k, and the bank gets nothing. So the friend gets $100k.

Wait, but another angle: the recording statute. If the friend recorded first, their mortgage is valid against subsequent purchasers. The investor and the bank are subsequent. So the friend's mortgage is first. The investor recorded after the friend, so their mortgage is second. The bank recorded after the investor, so third. So in the foreclosure, the friend gets first priority, investor second, bank third.

So the money goes as follows: $100k to friend, $80k to investor, $50k to bank. But the total is $230k, which is more than the sale price of $160k. So the friend gets $100k, investor gets $60k (since 160-100=60), and the bank gets nothing. So the friend gets $100k.

Wait, but another thought: the bank's mortgage was third. So the proceeds are distributed in order. Friend first, then investor, then bank. So friend gets their $100k, investor gets the next $60k, and the bank gets nothing. So the friend's amount is $100k, which is option A.

Wait, but let me check the options. Option A is $100,000.00. So that should be the answer.

The friend recorded first, giving their mortgage priority. The proceeds from the foreclosure sale are distributed in order of priority. The friend receives $100,000, the investor receives the next $60,000, and the bank receives nothing. Thus, the friend is entitled to $100,000.
