Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about calculating the net sales revenue for a shoe retailer. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

First, the company allows returns within 90 days. They estimate that 5% of sales will be returned. During the month, they had $200,000 in sales and $5,000 in returns from prior months. I need to find the net sales revenue for the new sales made that month.

Wait, so net sales revenue is calculated by taking the total sales and subtracting the returns and allowances, right? But I'm a bit confused about whether the returns are from the same month or prior months.

So, the company's sales for the month are $200,000. But they also had returns of $5,000 from prior sales. So, does this mean that these returns are from sales made before the current month? If so, how does that affect the current month's net sales?

Hmm, I think the key here is to separate the returns. The $5,000 returns are from prior months, so they don't directly affect the current month's sales. But wait, the company estimates 5% returns on all sales. So, should I adjust the current month's sales by that 5% return rate?

Let me think. The company's policy is that any sales can be returned within 90 days. So, when they made $200,000 in sales this month, they should account for the estimated returns. But the $5,000 returns are from prior periods, not this month's sales. So, should those prior returns affect this month's net sales?

Wait, maybe not. Because the prior returns are from prior sales, which were already accounted for in previous months' net sales. So, the net sales for the current month would just be the current month's sales minus the estimated returns from those sales.

So, the current month's sales are $200,000. The company estimates 5% of that will be returned. 5% of 200,000 is $10,000. So, the net sales would be 200,000 - 10,000 = $190,000.

Wait, but the return of $5,000 from prior months is a separate thing. Does that affect the current month's net sales? I think it doesn't because that's a return from before. So, the net sales for the current month would only be adjusted for the 5% of this month's sales.

So, the calculation would be $200,000 minus 5% of $200,000. That gives $190,000.

Looking at the options, J is $190,000. So, I think the answer is J.

The company records net sales revenue by subtracting estimated returns from current month sales. The prior month's returns don't affect the current calculation. Thus, net sales = $200,000 - 5% of $200,000 = $190,000.

Answer: J
