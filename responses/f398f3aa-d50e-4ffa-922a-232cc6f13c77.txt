Question:

Before the close of evidence in a federal negligence trial, the defendant submitted a proposed jury instruction on contributory negligence. Before instructing the jury, the judge informed the parties of the instructions she would give, which did not include the defendant's contributory negligence instruction or any instruction on contributory negligence. Neither party objected, either then or after the judge had given the instructions. The jury after the judge had given the instructions. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and the judge entered judgment on the verdict. The defendant would like to appeal the verdict on the ground that the judge should have instructed the jury on contributory negligence. Has the defendant preserved the issue for appeal?

Options:

A: Yes, because the judge's failure to give the defendant's contributory negligence instruction amounted to a ruling on the instruction.
B: Yes, because the defendant's proposed instruction was a valid point of appeal.
C: No, because the defendant did not raise the issue of contributory negligence during the trial.
D: Yes, because the defendant submitted a proposed instruction on contributory negligence.
E: No, because the defendant did not reiterate the need for the instruction after it was not included.
F: Yes, because the judge did not give an instruction on contributory negligence.
G: Yes, because the defendant's proposed instruction was ignored by the judge.
H: No, because the defendant failed to object after the judge informed the parties of the instructions she would give.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about whether the defendant preserved the issue for appeal regarding contributory negligence. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the scenario is a federal negligence trial. The defendant submitted a proposed jury instruction on contributory negligence before the evidence closed. That means the defendant thought it was important enough to include in the instructions the jury would receive.

Then, before instructing the jury, the judge told the parties what instructions she would give. Importantly, neither the defendant's contributory negligence instruction nor any instruction on that topic was included. So the judge didn't include it, but the defendant didn't object at that point. Neither party objected then, and also not after the instructions were given.

The jury ended up siding with the plaintiff, and the judge entered judgment accordingly. Now, the defendant wants to appeal, arguing that the judge should have given the contributory negligence instruction. The question is whether the defendant preserved this issue for appeal.

I remember that in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, specifically Rule 51, parties must object to jury instructions they believe are incorrect. The rule says that a party must make a timely objection to the instructions they think are erroneous. If they don't object, they might waive the issue for appeal.

So the key here is whether the defendant properly objected. The defendant proposed an instruction, but when the judge told them she wasn't going to include it, the defendant didn't object. Without an objection at that point, it seems like they didn't raise the issue during the trial.

Wait, but the defendant did propose the instruction. Does that count as raising the issue? I think proposing it is one thing, but the objection is what's required after the judge's ruling on the instructions. Because the judge might have overruled the proposed instruction, but if the defendant doesn't object when the judge says she won't include it, they might be stuck.

Looking at the options, option H says no because the defendant failed to object after the judge informed them. That makes sense because without an objection, the issue isn't preserved. The fact that they submitted the instruction doesn't automatically preserve it; they have to object when the judge's instructions are announced.

On the other hand, option A suggests it's preserved because the judge's failure was a ruling. But I think under Rule 51, the objection is required. So no, just submitting it isn't enough. The defendant needed to object when the judge didn't include it.

So the correct answer should be H: No, because the defendant didn't object when the judge told them the instructions wouldn't include contributory negligence.
