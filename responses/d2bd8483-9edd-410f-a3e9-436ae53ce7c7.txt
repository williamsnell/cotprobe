C: all be experienced in the same way.
D: all be of the same intensity.
E: all felt by a single person.

Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this Parfit question. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about what both Taurek and Lewis assume regarding the "sum of pain." Parfit is the one discussing their views, so I should recall what each of them thinks about aggregation of pain or suffering.

From what I remember, Derek Parfit discusses different theories of well-being in his work, particularly in " Reasons and Persons." He talks about how different philosophers approach the aggregation of values like pain and pleasure.

Taurek, I think, is a philosopher who argues against the possibility of interpersonal comparisons of well-being. He doesn't think we can aggregate pains and pleasures across different people because they might not be comparable. But when it comes to the sum of pain, perhaps he has some criteria.

David Lewis, on the other hand, is more of a reductionist. He might think that even if we can't directly compare pains between individuals, we can still sum them up in some way. But the question is about the condition both assume for there to be a sum of pain.

Looking at the options:

A: all be avoidable. Hmm, not sure. Do they require the pain to be avoidable to sum it? I don't think that's the case. The sum could include unavoidable pain.

B: only felt by multiple people at different times. That might relate to whether you can sum pains over time or across people. But I'm not certain.

C: all experienced in the same way. That could be about qualia—same type of pain. But I don't think that's the main point here.

D: all same intensity. That seems too specific. Probably not the case.

E: all felt by a single person. If it's a sum, maybe it's about a single person's pain over time. But I thought Taurek and Lewis might be considering across people as well.

F: all caused by a single source. That doesn't seem right. Pain can have multiple sources.

G: all caused by multiple sources. Also doesn't seem relevant to the summation condition.

H: all caused by a single event. Probably not, as events can cause multiple pains.

I: all felt at a single time. That could be about whether the sum is simultaneous or over time. Maybe.

J: all of the above. Unlikely, as the options are varied.

Wait, Parfit discusses that both Taurek and Lewis require that for there to be a sum of pain, each instance of pain must be such that it's possible to know or measure it in a way that allows aggregation. Taurek might require that each pain is comparable, but Lewis might have a different take.

But I think the key point is that both assume that each pain is experienced by a single person at a time. Because if the pain is spread across different people or times, you can't sum them unless each is a separate instance. So perhaps the condition is that all are felt by a single person at a single time. Wait, no—that would be too restrictive, because you could sum pain across different times for the same person.

Wait, maybe the condition is that each pain is an individual instance, so they can be added up. So the sum is possible only if each pain is a separate instance, perhaps experienced by different people or at different times. So the sum requires that each pain is a distinct experience, which would mean that they can be added together. So the condition is that each pain is an individual instance, possibly across different people or times.

Looking back at the options, option I says all felt at a single time. That might not be necessary because you can sum pains over time for the same person. So perhaps the condition is that each pain is an individual instance, regardless of when or whom. So maybe the answer is E: all felt by a single person. But wait, that would mean each pain is from one person, but you could have multiple people's pains summed. Or perhaps it's about the same person's pains over time.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Parfit discusses that both Taurek and Lewis believe that for pains to be summed, each pain must be such that it's possible to aggregate them. Taurek's view is that you can't compare pains across different people because they might not be similar enough, but he might accept that within a person, you can sum their pains over time. Lewis, being a reductionist, might allow for summing across different people if we can identify each pain as comparable.

Wait, but the question is about what both assume. Maybe they both assume that each pain is an individual instance, not dependent on others, so they can be added up. So the condition is that each pain is a separate experience, which would allow for summation. But looking at the options, none directly say that.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that each pain is experienced by a single person, meaning that each instance is from one person, allowing for summation across different people. So E: all felt by a single person. But that doesn't make sense because you can sum across multiple people. Wait, perhaps the condition is that each pain is from a single person, but you can sum across different people. No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the condition is that each pain is an individual instance, regardless of person or time, so you can sum them. But the options don't directly state that. Let me look again.

Option E is "all felt by a single person." That would mean that the sum is only for one person's pains, which might not be the case because Lewis allows for aggregation across people if possible. So perhaps the condition is that each pain is an individual instance, which could be from different people or times. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E: all felt by a single person. Because both Taurek and Lewis might require that each pain is from a single person, so you can sum them without worrying about interpersonal comparison issues. That makes sense because Taurek is skeptical about comparing pains across people, so he might only allow summing within a single person's experiences. Lewis might have a broader view but perhaps also requires each pain to be from an individual to sum them. So the answer would be E.

The answer is E: all felt by a single person. Both Taurek and Lewis likely assume that for there to be a "sum of pain," each instance of pain must be experienced by a single person, allowing for aggregation within that individual's experiences. This aligns with Taurek's skepticism about comparing pains across different people and Lewis's reductionist approach to aggregating pain.
