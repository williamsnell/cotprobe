Question:

The number pattern follows a skip-counting rule. 5, 20, 35, 50, 65... Which number pattern follows the same rule?

Options:

A: 13, 18, 23, 28, 33...
B: 5, 20, 25, 30, 35...
C: 12, 27, 42, 57, 72...

Okay, so I need to figure out which number pattern follows the same skip-counting rule as the given sequence: 5, 20, 35, 50, 65... Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll look at the given numbers to see the pattern. The sequence starts at 5 and then goes to 20. Let me calculate the difference between each term. 20 minus 5 is 15. Then, 35 minus 20 is also 15. Next, 50 minus 35 is 15 again, and 65 minus 50 is 15. So it looks like each time, we're adding 15. That means the pattern is adding 15 each step, which is a consistent skip-counting rule.

Now, I need to check each of the options to see which one follows the same rule of adding 15 each time.

Starting with option A: 13, 18, 23, 28, 33... Let's compute the differences. 18-13 is 5, 23-18 is 5, 28-23 is 5, and 33-28 is 5. So this pattern is adding 5 each time. That's different from the given rule of adding 15, so A is not the correct answer.

Next, option B: 5, 20, 25, 30, 35... Let's check the differences. 20-5 is 15, which matches. Then 25-20 is 5, which is a problem. Oh, wait, that's a big difference. So the first step is +15, then +5, then +5 again. That's inconsistent with the given pattern which adds 15 each time. So B isn't correct either.

Now, option C: 12, 27, 42, 57, 72... Let's see the differences. 27 minus 12 is 15, which is good. Then 42 minus 27 is 15, and 57 minus 42 is 15. Finally, 72 minus 57 is 15. All the differences are 15, so this follows the same skip-counting rule as the original sequence.

Wait, did I miss any other options? Oh, the options only go up to C, so I think I've checked all of them. So the correct answer must be option C because it consistently adds 15 each time, just like the given pattern.

The given sequence increases by 15 each time. Option C also consistently adds 15.

Answer: C
