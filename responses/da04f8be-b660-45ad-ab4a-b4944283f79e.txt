Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about auditing and illegal acts. I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is: Which of the following, discovered during an audit, most likely would raise a question concerning possible illegal acts? The options are A through J.

I need to figure out which of these options is a red flag that could indicate something illegal. I remember from my studies that during audits, certain red flags can indicate possible fraudulent activities or illegal acts. So, I should go through each option and assess whether it's a common red flag.

Starting with option A: The entity has been consistently late in paying its taxes for the year. Hmm, paying taxes late could be due to cash flow issues or just poor management, but it's not necessarily illegal. It's more of a compliance issue, but not a clear sign of illegal activity. So maybe not A.

Option B: The entity prepared several large checks payable to cash during the year. Payable to cash? That could mean checks made out to "Cash," which might be used for paying bribes or other illegal transactions. I've heard that companies sometimes issue checks to cash to make payments that aren't properly recorded, which can be a sign of fraud. That seems like a possible red flag.

Option C: The entity has a high turnover rate for its CFO position. High turnover in top financial positions could be a sign of problems, but it's not necessarily illegal. It might indicate management issues or a difficult work environment. But without more context, I'm not sure if this raises a question about illegal acts. Maybe not the most direct sign.

Option D: The entity was a campaign contributor to several local political candidates during the year. Political contributions are generally legal and common, especially for businesses. Unless the contributions are improperly recorded or exceeded legal limits, it's not illegal. So D might not be the answer.

Option E: Material internal control weaknesses previously reported to management were not corrected. Weak internal controls can lead to fraud, as it's easier for employees to commit wrongdoings without proper oversight. However, the question is about raising a question concerning possible illegal acts. While this is a risk factor, it's more about the possibility of fraud rather than direct evidence of illegal acts. It's a significant point but maybe not the most direct.

Option F: The entity has made several large donations to non-profit organizations. Donations are usually tax-deductible and legal. Unless the donations are meant to disguise other activities (like money laundering), it's not necessarily illegal. But if they're properly recorded, it's just charitable giving. So F might not be the issue.

Option G: The entity's financial statements show a consistent decrease in revenue over the year. A decrease in revenue could be due to economic downturns or poor sales. While it might indicate some underlying issues, it's not a direct sign of illegal activity. Unless it's due to fraudulent reporting, but the option doesn't specify that. So G is probably not the answer.

Option H: The entity has recently changed its accounting firm multiple times. Changing accounting firms can happen for various reasons, like dissatisfaction or a desire for new expertise. However, frequent changes might indicate that the company is trying to avoid scrutiny or has issues with previous auditors. But on its own, this isn't necessarily illegal unless there's a pattern of hiding something. So H is a possibility but maybe not the strongest option.

Option I: The entity has a significantly higher expenditure on office supplies than usual. High office supply expenses could be a sign of waste or mismanagement, but it's not inherently illegal. Unless the supplies are being used for fraudulent activities, like selling them or using them as cash, but the option doesn't specify that. So I might not be the answer.

Option J: Related party transactions, although properly disclosed, were pervasive during the year. Related party transactions can sometimes be problematic if they're not at arm's length or if they benefit individuals improperly. Even if they're disclosed, if they're pervasive, it could indicate that the company is engaging in transactions that might not be in the best interest of the entity, possibly for personal gain. This could be a sign of illegal acts, like self-dealing or fraud.

So, considering all options, the most likely red flags are B and J. B involves checks payable to cash, which can be used for illegal payments, and J involves pervasive related party transactions, which could indicate self-dealing or conflicts of interest.

I think J might be a stronger indicator because related party transactions that are too frequent or extensive can raise questions about whether they're being used for personal gain or other illegal purposes. Similarly, option B is a clear sign of possible fraudulent activity.

Wait, but the question is about which one "most likely" raises a question. I think both B and J are strong candidates. Let me think again.

Option B: Large checks payable to cash. This is a common red flag because cash is harder to track and can be used for bribes or other illegal payments. So if the entity is issuing a lot of these, it could be a way to pay for something off the books.

Option J: Related party transactions are pervasive. This could mean that the company is dealing a lot with related parties, which might be at non-arm's length terms. If the transactions are not properly managed, it could lead to illegal acts like favoritism or embezzlement.

I'm a bit torn between B and J. However, in auditing standards, related party transactions are a significant area of focus because they can indicate potential fraud or conflicts of interest. If they're pervasive, it might suggest that the entity is engaging in transactions that could be illegal, especially if they're not properly managed or appear to benefit individuals improperly.

On the other hand, option B directly relates to cash disbursements, which could be used for illegal payments. So both are strong, but I think J is more about the nature of the transactions themselves, which could be illegal if not conducted properly.

Alternatively, maybe B is more of a direct indicator of potential illegal activity because it's about how the company is paying out cash, which is a common method in fraud.

I'm still a bit confused. Let me try to recall examples. For instance, in the Enron scandal, related party transactions were a big issue, showing how the company engaged in illegal activities through complex transactions with related parties. So J could be a strong indicator.

But then again, checks payable to cash could be used to pay bribes or kickbacks, which are illegal. So both B and J are possible.

Wait, the question is about what would raise a question concerning possible illegal acts. So which one is more indicative?

I think both are, but perhaps J is more about the nature of the transactions, which could be illegal if they're not arms-length. So if they're pervasive, it could indicate that the entity is engaging in transactions that are not in the best interest of the company, possibly for personal gain, which is illegal.

Alternatively, option B is about how the company is paying, which could be a way to hide illegal payments.

I think I need to choose the best option. Between B and J, I think J is more about the substance of the transactions, which could be illegal, whereas B is about the method of payment, which could be a tool for illegal acts.

But in an audit, both would be red flags. However, the question is which is most likely to raise a question concerning possible illegal acts.

I think the answer is J. Because pervasive related party transactions can indicate that the entity is involved in transactions that might be illegal, such as self-dealing or favoritism, which are illegal under certain laws like the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

Alternatively, option B could be a sign of cash being misused for bribes or other illegal payments. So which is more likely to raise a question about illegal acts?

Maybe B is more direct because it's about how the company is handling cash, which is often a means of conducting illegal activities.

Wait, but the question is about what's discovered during an audit. So if the audit uncovers that the entity has many checks payable to cash, that could indicate they're using cash to make payments that aren't properly recorded, which could be illegal.

Similarly, if the audit finds that related party transactions are pervasive, it could indicate that the company is dealing with related parties in a way that's not transparent or could be illegal.

I think both are correct, but perhaps B is a more direct sign of potential illegal activity because it's about how the money is being spent.

Alternatively, maybe J is the better answer because it's about the nature of the transactions themselves.

I'm still a bit unsure, but I think the answer is J. Because related party transactions that are too extensive can indicate potential illegal acts like favoritism or self-dealing. The fact that they're properly disclosed doesn't necessarily mean they're legal; it just means they're declared. The pervasiveness could raise questions about their legitimacy.

Wait, but the question says "discovered during an audit." So if the audit uncovers that the entity has a lot of related party transactions, that might be a red flag. But if they're properly disclosed, maybe it's not as concerning.

Alternatively, maybe the issue is that the transactions are pervasive and could indicate that the entity is involved in illegal activities with related parties.

Hmm, I'm not entirely confident, but I think the intended answer is J. So I'll go with J.

The question asks which audit finding most likely raises concerns about possible illegal acts. After analyzing each option, the most significant red flags are related to the nature of transactions and how funds are being handled. While both options B and J are strong candidates, the pervasive nature of related party transactions (J) is more indicative of potential illegal acts, such as self-dealing or favoritism, which are serious legal concerns. Therefore, the answer is:

J
