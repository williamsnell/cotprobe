Okay, so I've got this question about conductors and heating when connected in series and parallel. Hmm, I remember that conductors have resistance, and when current flows through them, they can heat up. The question is asking about which conductor heats more in each configuration based on their cross-sectional area.

Alright, let me break this down. The two conductors are the same length and material, but different cross-sectional areas. So, the one with a larger cross-sectional area should have lower resistance because resistance R is inversely proportional to area (R = ρL/A, where ρ is resistivity, L is length, A is area). 

First, let's think about when they're connected in series. In a series connection, the current through both conductors is the same. The power dissipated (which causes heating) is given by P = I²R. Since the larger area conductor has lower resistance, its power would be lower. So the smaller area conductor has higher resistance and thus higher power, meaning it heats more in series.

Now, when they're connected in parallel. In parallel, the voltage across each conductor is the same. Power is also given by P = V²/R. Again, the smaller area conductor has higher resistance, so V²/R would be larger for it. Therefore, it would dissipate more power and heat more in parallel as well.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. In parallel, each has the same voltage, so P = V²/R. The larger area conductor has lower R, so V²/R is smaller, meaning less power. The smaller area has higher R, so more power. So in both cases, the smaller area conductor heats more. But wait, looking at the options, I need to see which one matches this.

Looking at the options, option J says: Greater in the smaller area when in series, and greater in the larger area when in parallel. That doesn't fit because in parallel, the larger area would have less heating.

Option I says: Greater in smaller area when parallel, and larger when series. Wait, no, that's opposite. Wait, in series, the smaller area has higher R, so more heating. In parallel, same voltage: smaller area has higher R, so more heating. So in both cases, the smaller area conductor heats more. But wait, that can't be right because when in parallel, the larger area has lower R, so lower power. So in both series and parallel, the smaller area conductor heats more. But I don't see that option.

Wait, looking again at the options:

Option J: Greater in smaller when in series, greater in larger when in parallel. That's not right because in parallel, the smaller would still have more heating.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again.

In series: same current. Power is I²R. So smaller area (higher R) → more heating.

In parallel: same voltage. Power is V²/R. Smaller area (higher R) → more heating.

So in both cases, the smaller area conductor heats more. But none of the options say that. Let me see the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option I: Greater in smaller when parallel; greater in larger when series. No, because in series, smaller has more heating.

Option J: Greater in smaller when series; greater in larger when parallel. Also no.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It says "heating will be greater in each case." So in series, the heating is greater in the smaller cross-sectional area; in parallel, heating is greater in the smaller cross-sectional area as well. But none of the options say that. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe in parallel, the larger area has lower resistance, so same voltage across both. So P = V²/R. Larger area → lower R → less power. Smaller area → higher R → more power. So in parallel, the smaller area conductor heats more.

So in both cases, the smaller area conductor heats more. But looking at the options, I don't see an option that says that. Let me check the options again.

Option I: greater in smaller when parallel; greater in larger when series. No.

Option J: greater in smaller when series; greater in larger when parallel. No, because in parallel, smaller area still has more heating.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think about parallel again. If two resistors are in parallel, each has the same voltage. So for each resistor, power is V²/R. So R is higher for the smaller area, so more power. So in parallel, the smaller area conductor dissipates more power and heats more. Similarly, in series, same current, so I²R is higher for smaller area. So in both cases, the smaller area conductor heats more.

But none of the options state that. Let me look again.

Option I: Greater in smaller when parallel; greater in larger when series. No, that's opposite.

Option J: Greater in smaller when series; greater in larger when parallel. No.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think again: in parallel, current splits. So the current through each conductor is V/R. For the larger area, R is smaller, so current is higher. But wait, in parallel, each has the same V. So the current through each is I = V/R. So the smaller area conductor has higher R → lower current, but higher power because P=V²/R. So P is higher for the smaller area.

So in parallel, smaller area conductor has higher power. So in both series and parallel, the smaller area conductor has higher heating.

But looking at the options, none of them say that. So perhaps the correct answer is that in series, the smaller area heats more, and in parallel, the smaller area also heats more. But none of the options match that.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. The question is asking, for each case (series and parallel), in which conductor is the heating greater. So, in series, which one? And in parallel, which one?

So in series: same current. R is higher for smaller area → more heating. So in series, smaller area conductor heats more.

In parallel: same voltage. R is higher for smaller area → more heating. So in parallel, smaller area conductor heats more.

So for both cases, the heating is greater in the smaller area conductor.

Looking at the options, I don't see an option that says that. So perhaps the correct answer is option I or J, but they don't match. Let me check the options again.

Option I: Greater in the smaller cross-sectional area when in parallel; greater in the larger cross-sectional area when in series. No, that's opposite.

Option J: Greater in the smaller cross-sectional area when in series; greater in the larger cross-sectional area when in parallel. No, because in parallel, the smaller area should have more heating.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the formula again.

In series: same current. Power P = I² R. Since R is higher for smaller area, P is higher for smaller area. So heating is greater in the smaller area.

In parallel: same voltage. Power P = V² / R. Again, R is higher for smaller area → higher P. So heating is greater in the smaller area.

So the correct answer would be that in both cases, the smaller area conductor heats more. But none of the options seem to say that. Looking back at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the options.

Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check again.

Option I: Greater in the conductor with the smaller cross-sectional area when in parallel; greater in the conductor with the larger cross-sectional area when in series.

So that's: in parallel, smaller area → more heating; in series, larger area → more heating. That's the opposite of what I concluded.

Option J: Greater in the smaller when in series; greater in larger when in parallel. That would mean in series, smaller area → more heating (correct), but in parallel, larger area → more heating (incorrect, as per my analysis).

Hmm, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think about parallel again. Maybe I have it backwards.

Wait, in parallel, each resistor has the same voltage. So for the larger area, R is lower. So power P = V²/R. So larger area → lower R → lower P → less heating.

Smaller area → higher R → higher P → more heating.

So in parallel, smaller area conductor heats more.

In series, same current. So P = I² R. Smaller area → higher R → higher P → more heating.

So in both cases, the smaller area conductor heats more.

But the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong options. Let me check again.

Wait, option I says: greater in smaller when parallel; greater in larger when series. So that's the opposite of what I found.

Option J: greater in smaller when series; greater in larger when parallel. So in series, correct; in parallel, incorrect.

Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake. Let me think of an example. Suppose we have two conductors, A and B. A has area 2, B has area 1. So R_A = ρL/(2A), R_B = ρL/(1A) → R_B = 2 R_A.

In series: same current I. Power for A: I² R_A. Power for B: I² R_B = 2 I² R_A. So B has higher power → more heating. Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion.

Wait, no! Wait, if A has larger area, R_A is lower. So if A is larger, R_A is lower. So if I have two conductors, A with larger area, R_A is lower. So in series, same current: P = I² R. So A has lower R → lower power → less heating. B has higher R → higher power → more heating.

Ah! Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because the question says "different cross-sectional area", but didn't specify which is larger. So the one with larger cross-sectional area has lower resistance.

So let me correct this. Let's say conductor 1 has area A1, conductor 2 has area A2, and A1 > A2. So R1 = ρL/A1, R2 = ρL/A2. So R2 > R1.

In series: same current. P1 = I² R1, P2 = I² R2. Since R2 > R1, P2 > P1. So the conductor with smaller area (higher R) has more heating.

In parallel: same voltage. P1 = V²/R1, P2 = V²/R2. Since R2 > R1, 1/R2 < 1/R1 → P2 = V²/R2 < P1. So in parallel, the conductor with larger area (lower R) would have lower power, and the smaller area (higher R) would have higher power.

Wait, that's the same as before. So in series, smaller area → more heating. In parallel, same thing: smaller area → more heating.

But looking at the options, none match that. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question is asking, for each case (series and parallel), which conductor has greater heating. So the answer would be that in series, the conductor with smaller area (higher resistance) has more heating. In parallel, same thing: smaller area → more heating.

So if the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but looking at the options again, perhaps option I is correct.

Wait, option I says: greater in smaller when parallel, greater in larger when series. That's the opposite of what I concluded.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again with numbers.

Example: Conductor X has area 2 (lower resistance), Conductor Y has area 1 (higher resistance).

In series:

Current I same. Power for X: I² R_x. R_x = ρL/2. R_y = ρL/1 = 2 R_x.

So P_x = I² (ρL/2), P_y = I² (2 ρL) = 4 I² (ρL/2) = 2 P_x. So Y has more heating in series.

In parallel:

Voltage V same. Power P = V²/R.

P_x = V²/(ρL/2) = 2 V²/(ρL)

P_y = V²/(2 ρL/2) → Wait, no: R_y = ρL/1, so P_y = V²/(ρL/1) = V²/(R_y).

Wait, no: R_x = ρL/(2), R_y = ρL/(1) → R_y = 2 R_x.

So P_x = V²/(R_x) = V²/(ρL/2) = 2 V²/(ρL)

P_y = V²/(R_y) = V²/(2 ρL/2?) No, R_y is ρL/(1), so P_y = V²/(ρL/(1)) = V²/(R_y) = V²/(ρL/(1)).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

Let me compute it numerically. Suppose ρ=1, L=1 for simplicity.

So R_x = 1/(2) = 0.5 Ω

R_y = 1/1 = 1 Ω

In series: same current, I.

Power for X: I² * 0.5

Power for Y: I² * 1 → higher than X. So Y has more heating in series.

In parallel: same voltage, V.

Power for X: V² / 0.5 = 2 V²

Power for Y: V² / 1 = V² → So X has more heating in parallel.

So in series, Y (smaller area, higher R) has more heating.

In parallel, X (larger area, lower R) has lower heating, Y has higher heating? Wait no: in parallel, X has lower R → higher power. Because V is same.

Wait, no: because R_x is 0.5, R_y is 1. So P_x = V²/0.5 = 2 V², P_y = V²/1 = V². So X has higher power than Y in parallel.

Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier conclusion. Because in my earlier analysis, I thought that in parallel, the conductor with higher R (smaller area) would have higher power. But in this example, X has larger area (lower R) and higher power in parallel. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me clarify:

In parallel, each resistor has same voltage. Power is V²/R. So lower R → higher power. So the conductor with larger area (lower R) has higher power in parallel.

Wait, that's opposite of what I thought earlier. So in this example, X (larger area, R=0.5) has higher power in parallel than Y (smaller area, R=1). So in parallel, larger area → higher heating.

Wait, but that's conflicting with my initial analysis. So where did I go wrong?

Ah, I think I confused the relationship. Let me re-express.

Resistance R is inversely proportional to cross-sectional area A. So larger A → lower R.

In parallel, power P = V² / R. So lower R → higher P.

So in parallel, the conductor with larger area (lower R) dissipates more power and thus more heating.

In series, same current. P = I² R. So higher R → higher power. So the conductor with smaller area (higher R) has more heating.

So in series, the smaller area conductor heats more. In parallel, the larger area conductor heats more.

So the correct answer is that in series, the smaller area has more heating, and in parallel, the larger area has more heating.

Looking at the options, which one matches this?

Option I: Greater in the smaller cross-sectional area when in parallel; greater in the larger cross-sectional area when in series. No, that's opposite.

Option J: Greater in the smaller cross-sectional area when in series; greater in the larger cross-sectional area when in parallel. Yes! Because in series, smaller area → more heating; in parallel, larger area → more heating.

So the correct answer is option J.
</think>

When two conductors of the same length and material but different cross-sectional areas are connected in series and parallel, the heating depends on the configuration and the cross-sectional area. 

- **In series**: The current through both conductors is the same. The power dissipated is given by \( P = I^2 R \), where resistance \( R \) is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. Thus, the conductor with the smaller cross-sectional area (higher resistance) dissipates more power and heats more.

- **In parallel**: The voltage across both conductors is the same. The power dissipated is given by \( P = \frac{V^2}{R} \), where resistance \( R \) is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. Thus, the conductor with the larger cross-sectional area (lower resistance) dissipates more power and heats more.

From this analysis, in series, the conductor with the smaller cross-sectional area heats more, and in parallel, the conductor with the larger cross-sectional area heats more. 

**Option J** correctly states: "Greater in the conductor with the smaller cross-sectional area when in series; greater in the conductor with the larger cross-sectional area when in parallel."
