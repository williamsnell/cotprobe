Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I need to figure out which statement is true regarding genetic variation. Let's read through the options carefully and think through each one.

The question is about genetic variation, which I remember is the diversity in genes among individuals in a population. This variation is crucial for evolution because it provides the raw material for natural selection to act upon.

Looking at the options:

Option A says genetic variation is created by natural selection. Wait, isn't it the other way around? Natural selection acts on existing variation; it doesn't create it. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B: It tends to be reduced by processes when diploids produce gametes. Hmm, when diploid organisms (like humans) produce gametes, they undergo meiosis, which includes processes like crossing over and independent assortment. These actually increase genetic variation, not reduce it. So B sounds false.

Option C: Must be present before natural selection can act. Yes, that makes sense. If there's no variation, selection can't do anything because there are no differing traits to select for. So C seems correct.

Option D: Always increased by gamete production. Well, meiosis usually increases variation, but sometimes things like inbreeding can reduce it. So it's not always increased. D is probably wrong.

Option E: Not affected by environmental changes. I don't think so. Environmental changes can influence which variations are selected for, but they don't create the variation. However, the statement says it's not affected, which might be true because variation arises from genetic processes, not the environment. But I'm not sure yet.

Option F: Created only by artificial selection. No, genetic variation comes from mutations, recombination, etc., not just artificial selection. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Only present after selection. No, variation exists before selection happens. G is wrong.

Option H: Arises independently of the environment. This seems true. Genetic variation comes from mutations and recombination, which happen regardless of the environment. So H could be correct.

Option I: Same as B but says "always reduced." As I thought earlier, gamete production usually increases variation, so I is wrong.

Option J: Arises in response to environment. No, variation is random and not caused by the environment. So J is incorrect.

Now, looking back at the options, both C and H seem plausible. But wait, the question is about which statement is true concerning genetic variation.

Option C says variation must be present before selection can act. That's definitely true because selection can't act on what's not there.

Option H says variation arises independently of the environment. That's also true because variation comes from genetic processes, not the environment.

But let me check the options again. The question asks which is a true statement. So both C and H might be correct. Wait, looking at the options again:

Wait, the options are from A to J. Let me double-check each.

Option C: It must be present in a population before natural selection can act upon the population. Yes, correct.

Option H: It arises independently of changes in the environment. Also correct because variation is a result of genetic factors, not environmental changes.

So both C and H are correct statements. But looking at the options again, let me make sure. The question has only one correct answer, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, the options are presented as A to J, and I need to choose one. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, the initial analysis: Option C is correct because selection can't act without variation. Option H is also correct because variation isn't caused by the environment.

But looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct. Let me see the options again.

The options are:

C: It must be present before selection.

H: Arises independently of environment.

So both C and H are true statements. But wait, the question is which is a true statement, so perhaps both are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only one is presented as correct.

Wait, the options list only one correct answer. So perhaps I need to see which is more true.

Wait, the question is about which is true concerning genetic variation. So both C and H are true. But looking back at the options, perhaps the correct answer is C and H. But the options only provide single letters.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Option B and I say variation is reduced by gamete production, which is wrong because gamete production (meiosis) increases variation. So B and I are incorrect.

Option E: Not affected by environmental changes. Well, variation itself isn't directly affected by the environment, but the environment can influence which variations are selected for. So E is correct in stating it's not affected by environmental changes in terms of creation, but H says it arises independently, which is the same as E.

Wait, E says it's not affected by environment, which is correct because variation arises from genetic factors, not environment. So E is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought H is correct. So perhaps I need to see which is the correct statement.

Alternatively, let me think about each option again.

Option C: Must be present before selection can act. Correct because selection acts on existing variation.

Option H: Arises independently of changes in the environment. Correct because variation arises from genetic processes, not the environment.

But the question is about which is a true statement. So both C and H are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question has only one correct answer. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: Created by natural selection. No.

B: Reduced by gamete production. No.

C: Must be present before selection. Yes.

D: Always increased by gamete production. No.

E: Not affected by environment. Yes.

F: Only created by artificial selection. No.

G: Only present after selection. No.

H: Arises independently of environment. Yes.

I: Always reduced by gamete production. No.

J: Arises in response to environment. No.

So both C, E, and H are correct. But the options may only have one correct answer. Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C and H are both correct, but looking at the original question, perhaps the intended correct answer is C.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The question is asking for a true statement about genetic variation. So:

- C is correct because variation must exist for selection to act.

- H is correct because variation arises from genetic processes, not environment.

- E is correct because variation isn't directly affected by environment.

But looking at the options, perhaps C is the intended correct answer.

Wait, but looking back, the options are presented as A to J, and perhaps only one is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is C and H.

Wait, but I have to choose one. The initial analysis suggests that C is correct because without variation, selection can't act. So the correct answer is C.

The question asks which statement is true concerning genetic variation. Genetic variation refers to the diversity of genes in a population, which serves as the foundation for evolution. Letâ€™s analyze each option:

- **A**: Incorrect. Natural selection acts on existing variation; it does not create it.
- **B**: Incorrect. Processes like meiosis (crossing over and independent assortment) increase genetic variation, so it is not reduced.
- **C**: Correct. Natural selection cannot act on a population without pre-existing genetic variation.
- **D**: Incorrect. While meiosis increases variation, it does not always do so (e.g., inbreeding can reduce variation).
- **E**: Correct. Genetic variation arises from genetic processes, not environmental changes.
- **F**: Incorrect. Genetic variation arises from mutations and recombination, not only artificial selection.
- **G**: Incorrect. Variation exists before natural selection acts.
- **H**: Correct. Genetic variation arises from genetic processes, independent of environmental changes.
- **I**: Incorrect. Variation is not always reduced; meiosis typically increases it.
- **J**: Incorrect. Variation is random and not caused by environmental changes.

Both **C**, **E**, and **H** are true statements. However, the question asks for a single correct answer, and **C** is the most directly relevant to the role of genetic variation in natural selection.

Answer: C
