Question:

The dirt floor of theShanidarCave in the northern part of Iraq has been examined. Below the layer of soil that contained arrowheads and bone awls was a layer of soil that yielded flint tools and pieces of charcoal. When the charcoal was examined it was discovered that in 1 kg of carbon, approximately 9.4 × 10^2 carbon\Elzbar14 nuclei decayed each second. It is known that in 1 kg of carbon from living material, 1.5 × 10^4 disintegrations of carbon\Elzbar14 occur each second. Use these data to calculate when people of the stone age culture occupied the cave.

Options:

A: 6.5 × 10^4 years ago
B: 4.6 × 10^4 years ago
C: 9.4 × 10^2 years ago
D: 8.8 × 10^3 years ago

G: 11,460 years ago
H: 7.3 × 10^3 years ago
I: 1.5 × 10^4 years ago

Okay, so I've got this question about the Shanidar Cave and figuring out when people lived there. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

Alright, the question says that in the cave, they found two layers. The upper layer had arrowheads and bone awls, and the lower layer had flint tools and charcoal. They examined the charcoal and found that in 1 kg of carbon, about 9.4 × 10^2 carbon-14 nuclei decayed each second. Normally, in living material, 1 kg of carbon has 1.5 × 10^4 disintegrations per second. So I guess I need to find out how much time has passed since the charcoal was part of living material, which would tell me when the people were there.

Hmm, I remember that carbon-14 dating involves figuring out how much of the isotope has decayed. The basic idea is that living things absorb carbon-14, and when they die, they stop taking it in. The amount present now tells us how old the sample is. The formula I think is something like N = N0 * e^(-λt), where N is the current amount, N0 is the initial amount, λ is the decay constant, and t is time. Or maybe using half-life concepts.

Wait, but maybe there's a simpler way since we're given the current decay rate and the original. So the decay rate is proportional to the amount of carbon-14 present. So if the living material has R0 disintegrations per second, and the sample has R now, then R = R0 * (1/2)^(t / t_half), where t_half is the half-life of carbon-14. I think the half-life is about 5730 years.

Let me write down what I have:

R0 (living) = 1.5 × 10^4 disintegrations per second per kg
R (sample) = 9.4 × 10^2 disintegrations per second per kg

So the ratio R/R0 is (9.4e2) / (1.5e4) = let's calculate that. 9.4e2 is 940, and 1.5e4 is 15000. So 940 / 15000 ≈ 0.06267. So about 6.267% of the original activity remains.

Since activity is proportional to the amount of carbon-14, which follows an exponential decay, I can use the formula:

ln(R/R0) = -λ t

But λ is the decay constant, which is ln(2) / t_half. So λ = 0.6931 / 5730 per year.

Alternatively, using the half-life approach, since each half-life reduces the activity by half. So if R/R0 = 1/2^n, then n is the number of half-lives. Because 1/2^n = 0.06267, so solving for n.

Let me calculate n: take the natural log of both sides. ln(R/R0) = -n ln(2). So n = ln(R0/R) / ln(2).

Wait, R is less than R0, so R/R0 is less than 1. Let me compute ln(0.06267). Let's see: ln(0.06267) ≈ ln(1/16) because 1/16 is 0.0625. So ln(1/16) is -ln(16) ≈ -2.7726. But wait, 0.06267 is just a tiny bit more than 1/16 (which is 0.0625), so maybe the actual ln is a bit less negative. Let's approximate it as ln(0.06267) ≈ -2.7726.

Then n = (-2.7726) / (-0.6931) ≈ 4. So n is approximately 4 half-lives. Since each half-life is 5730 years, the time t is 4 * 5730 = 22,920 years. Wait, but that's not one of the options. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option J is 3.0 × 10^4, which is 30,000 years. Option F is 2.3 ×10^4 (23,000). My calculation gave 22,920, which is close to 23,000. So option F would be 2.3e4, which is 23,000. But wait, did I make a mistake because I approximated ln(0.06267) as ln(1/16)= -2.7726, but maybe it's a bit different.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. Let me calculate 940 / 15000. 940 ÷ 15,000 = 0.062666... So R/R0 ≈ 0.06267. Now, taking the natural log of that: ln(0.06267). Let me compute it properly. Let's see, ln(0.0625) is exactly ln(1/16) = -2.77258872. Since 0.06267 is a bit more than 0.0625, the ln would be slightly less negative. Let's say approximately -2.772588 + a tiny bit. For precise calculation, perhaps using a calculator isn't possible, but let's proceed with the exact value.

So, using the formula:

t = (ln(R/R0)) / (-λ)

But λ = ln(2)/t_half = 0.6931 / 5730 ≈ 1.208 × 10^-4 per year.

Wait, alternatively, using the formula t = t_half * ln(R0/R) / ln(2). Because R = R0 * (1/2)^(t/t_half), so rearranged:

t = t_half * ln(R0/R) / ln(2)

So R0/R is 15000 / 940 ≈ 15.957. So ln(15.957) ≈ let's compute that. ln(16) is 2.772588, so ln(15.957) is slightly less, maybe 2.77. Let's say approximately 2.77.

So t = 5730 years * (2.77) / 0.6931 ≈ 5730 * (2.77 / 0.6931). Let's compute 2.77 / 0.6931 ≈ 4. So 5730 * 4 ≈ 22,920 years, which is 2.292e4 years. So that's about 2.3 ×10^4 years ago, which is option F.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is 2.3 ×10^4 years, which is 23,000 years. So that seems to match.

But wait, let me double-check because another approach using decay constant. The decay constant λ is 0.6931 / 5730 ≈ 1.208e-4 per year.

The decay formula is R = R0 * e^(-λ t). So solving for t:

t = ln(R0/R) / λ

R0 is 1.5e4, R is 9.4e2.

So ln(1.5e4 / 9.4e2) = ln(15.957) ≈ 2.7725 (as before). So t = 2.7725 / (0.6931/5730) ) = 2.7725 * (5730 / 0.6931). Let's compute 5730 / 0.6931 ≈ 8270. So 2.7725 * 8270 ≈ let's compute that. 2.7725 * 8000 = 22,180, and 2.7725 * 270 ≈ 750. So total ≈ 22,930 years. Again, around 22,930, which is about 2.3e4, so option F.

Hmm, but wait, the options don't have 22,930, but option J is 3.0e4, which is 30,000, and option F is 2.3e4. So 22,930 is closer to 2.3e4 than to 3e4. So I think the correct answer is F: 2.3 ×10^4 years ago.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I remember that sometimes in such problems, you have to account for the fact that the ratio of C-14 to C-12 in the atmosphere can change over time, but I think the question assumes a standard ratio, so I don't need to worry about that here.

Another way to think about it: The current activity is 940 disintegrations per kg per second, and the initial was 15,000. So the ratio is 940/15000 = 0.06267, which is approximately 1/16. Since each half-life reduces the activity by half, 1/16 is 1/(2^4), so four half-lives. 4 * 5730 = 22,920 years. So yeah, that's the same as before.

So the answer should be F: 2.3 ×10^4 years ago.
</think>

To determine when the people of the stone age culture occupied the Shanidar Cave, we use carbon-14 dating. The decay rate of carbon-14 in the charcoal sample is given as 9.4 × 10² disintegrations per second per kg, while the decay rate in living material is 1.5 × 10⁴ disintegrations per second per kg. 

The ratio of the current decay rate to the original decay rate is:

\[
\frac{R}{R_0} = \frac{9.4 \times 10^2}{1.5 \times 10^4} \approx 0.06267
\]

This ratio corresponds to approximately \( \frac{1}{16} \), indicating that four half-lives have passed. Since the half-life of carbon-14 is 5730 years, the time elapsed is:

\[
t = 4 \times 5730 = 22,920 \text{ years}
\]

This value is closest to option F, which is \( 2.3 \times 10^4 \) years ago.
