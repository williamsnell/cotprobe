Okay, so I need to answer this question about Selye's General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS) theory. The question is asking during which stage we are most susceptible to disease. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that GAS has three main stages: the alarm stage, the resistance stage, and the exhaustion stage. Wait, are there more stages? I think some sources might break it down into more parts, but I'm pretty sure the core is these three.

The alarm stage is when the body first detects a stressor. The sympathetic nervous system kicks in, releasing adrenaline and stuff. This is like the 'fight or flight' response. People might feel stressed here, but I don't think this is the most susceptible time. Because the body is mobilizing resources to handle the stressor, so it's more about initial reaction.

Then comes the resistance stage. Here, the body tries to adapt and cope with the stress. It uses the parasympathetic nervous system to maintain homeostasis. During this phase, the body is building up its defenses, so it's kind of fighting the stressor. But if the stress is prolonged, the body might start to wear down.

The third stage is exhaustion. This is when the body can no longer maintain the resistance and starts to deplete its resources. The adaptive mechanisms become exhausted, and the body can't handle the stress anymore. This is when the person becomes vulnerable to diseases like infections because their immune system is weakened.

Looking at the options provided: the options include adjustment, homeostasis, exhaustion, stressor detection, resolution, resistance, alarm, recovery, accommodation, and preparation.

So, the question is about susceptibility to disease. From what I know, the exhaustion stage is when the body's defenses are down, making it easier to get sick. So the answer should be exhaustion, which is option C.

Wait, let me double-check. Selye's theory says that if the stress is too prolonged and the resistance stage is not exited, the body moves into exhaustion. During this time, the body's adaptive resources are depleted, so it's more prone to diseases. Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer is C: exhaustion.

The correct answer is C: exhaustion. During this stage, the body's defenses are depleted, making it susceptible to disease.
