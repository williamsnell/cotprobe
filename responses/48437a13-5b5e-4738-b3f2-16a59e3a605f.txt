Alright, so I have this question about literacy rates in late Imperial Russia and the Soviet Union. The chart shows that literacy rates increased from 24% in 1897 to 99.9% in 1955. That's a huge jump, especially during the Soviet era. The question is asking which segment of the population would have benefited the most from this rise in literacy.

Looking at the options, I need to think about which groups would have had better access to education during this time. Imperial Russia had a lot of peasants, and after the revolution, the Soviet Union made significant efforts to boost literacy, especially in rural areas. So maybe the rural peasantry would have benefited a lot. But wait, other groups like industrial laborers in cities might have had better access too because cities often have more schools and resources.

The options include various groups like officers, urban middle class, clergy, nobility, etc. The nobility and clergy were probably already more literate, so the increase might not have affected them as much. The urban middle class might have had higher literacy already. Artists and writers might also have been more literate, but the question is about who gained the most from the rising rates.

The Soviet government focused a lot on educating the peasantry because they were the majority and needed to be more literate for industrialization and collectivization. So the rural peasantry (option H) would have seen a significant increase in literacy. Industrial laborers in cities (option A) might have also benefited, but perhaps the rural areas had a bigger jump because they started from a lower base.

So, considering that the Soviet Union implemented literacy campaigns, especially targeting rural areas, the rural peasantry would have been the main beneficiaries. Therefore, the answer is likely H.

The rising literacy rates during the Soviet era, particularly after 1917, were driven by government campaigns aimed at educating the largely rural and less literate population. The rural peasantry, who made up a significant portion of the population, would have benefited the most from these efforts. 

Answer: H
