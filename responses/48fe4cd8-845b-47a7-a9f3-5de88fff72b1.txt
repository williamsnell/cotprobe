Okay, so I need to figure out the expected return of an equal-weighted portfolio composed of Securities A and C. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, I remember that an equal-weighted portfolio means each security has the same weight in the portfolio. Since there are two securities, A and C, each will have a weight of 50%. That makes sense because equal weighting would split the investment equally between them.

Next, I look at the expected returns provided. Security A has an expected return of 7%, and Security C has an expected return of 5%. Security B isn't part of this portfolio, so I can ignore it. 

Now, to find the expected return of the portfolio, I think I should calculate the weighted average of the expected returns of A and C. The formula for the expected return of a portfolio is the sum of each security's weight multiplied by its expected return. 

So, let me write that out. The expected return (E(Rp)) would be:
E(Rp) = (Weight of A * Expected Return of A) + (Weight of C * Expected Return of C)

Plugging in the numbers:
E(Rp) = (0.5 * 7%) + (0.5 * 5%)

Calculating each part:
0.5 * 7% = 3.5%
0.5 * 5% = 2.5%

Adding them together:
3.5% + 2.5% = 6%

Wait, that gives me 6%, but let me double-check. Oh, wait, no, 3.5 plus 2.5 is actually 6%. Hmm, but looking at the options, 6% is option G. But wait, another way to think about itâ€”since it's an average of 7% and 5%, the average should be (7+5)/2 = 6%. So yeah, that seems right.

But wait, why is option J 7%? Did I miss something? Oh, no, because the portfolio is equally weighted between A and C, not including B. So Security B's 12% doesn't factor in here. So the calculation is correct. 

Therefore, the expected return should be 6%, which is option G.

The expected return is calculated as the average of 7% and 5%, resulting in 6%.

Answer: G
