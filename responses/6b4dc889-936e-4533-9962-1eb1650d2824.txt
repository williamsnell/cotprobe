Okay, so I have this accounting problem about inventory valuation, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

Pinson's Wholesale Hardware has 44,000 steel bolts on hand at year-end. They want to find the value of this inventory using three methods: average cost, FIFO, and LIFO. The records show four transactions: beginning inventory, and three purchases in March, September, and December.

First, I need to figure out the total quantity purchased and the total cost to compute the average cost. Then, for FIFO and LIFO, I'll need to track the flow of inventory.

Let me list the transactions:

1. January 1 (beginning inventory): 27,000 bolts at $6.00 each.
2. March 12 purchase: 50,000 bolts at $6.50.
3. September 11 purchase: 35,000 bolts at $7.00.
4. December 3 purchase: 40,000 bolts at $7.50.

The ending inventory is 44,000 bolts. So the total bolts available during the year are the sum of all purchases plus the beginning inventory.

Wait, no, the total available is the sum of all the purchases and the beginning inventory, but we need to subtract the bolts sold to get the ending inventory. But I don't have the number of bolts sold. Hmm, maybe the problem is that I have to assume all purchases are added to inventory, and the ending inventory is 44,000, so the total available is the sum of all the beginning and purchases, and the ending inventory is 44,000. So the cost of goods sold would be total available minus ending inventory. But for the purposes of this question, I think I just need to calculate the ending inventory value under each method.

Wait, maybe I should compute the total quantity available and then see how much is left in inventory. Let me calculate the total quantity:

27,000 (beginning) + 50,000 + 35,000 + 40,000 = 27k +50k=77k +35k=112k +40k=152k. So total available is 152,000 bolts.

Ending inventory is 44,000. So the cost of goods sold (COGS) would be 152,000 -44,000=108,000. But wait, no, that's not correct because COGS is not the same as the total used. Wait, no, the total available is 152k, and ending inventory is 44k, so the COGS is 108k. But maybe I don't need to compute COGS directly. Let me think.

For average cost method:

First, I need to compute the total cost of all inventory.

Compute each purchase's cost:

- Jan 1: 27,000 *6 = $162,000
- March 12: 50,000 *6.5 = $325,000
- Sept 11: 35,000 *7 = $245,000
- Dec 3:40,000 *7.5 = $300,000

Total cost = 162,000 +325,000=487,000 +245,000=732,000 +300,000=1,032,000.

Total quantity is 152,000 as before.

Average cost per bolt = total cost / total quantity = 1,032,000 / 152,000 = let's calculate that.

1,032,000 ÷ 152,000.

Dividing both numerator and denominator by 8: 129,000 / 19,000. Let me see:

19,000 * 57 = 1,083,000 which is too high. Wait, 19,000 *54= 1,026,000. Hmm, 19,000*54=1,026,000. Then 1,032,000 -1,026,000=6,000. 6,000 /19,000=0.315789... So average cost is 54.315789 ≈ $54.32 per bolt.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because the options have average costs like $275.50, which is way lower. Oh wait, I think I messed up the thousands. Because 152,000 is 152k, and total cost is $1,032,000. So average cost is 1,032,000 / 152,000 = let's compute:

152,000 * 6 = 912,000. 1,032,000 -912,000=120,000. 120,000 /152,000 = 0.788 approx. So total average is 6 + 0.788 ≈6.788 per bolt. Wait, that's more reasonable. So $6.79 per bolt.

Then, ending inventory is 44,000 *6.79. Let's compute that.

44,000 *6 =264,000. 44,000 *0.79=34,760. So total is 264k +34,760= $298,760.

Wait, but looking at the options, the average cost is per unit? Or is it the total? Wait, the question says "the value of the December 31 inventory", so the total value.

Wait, the options list average cost as, for example, option G is average cost: $298.76. Wait, that's per bolt? No, that can't be, because 44,000 *298.76 would be way too high. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the average cost calculation.

Wait, no, the average cost is per bolt. So if average cost is $6.79 per bolt, then 44,000 *6.79 = 298,760. So the total inventory value is $298,760. Looking at the options, option G's average cost is $298.76, but that's per bolt? Or is it the total? Wait, the options say "Average cost: $298.76". That would imply per bolt, but 44,000 *298.76 is way more than any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the average cost per bolt.

Total cost: 162,000 (Jan) +325,000 (Mar) = 487,000 +245,000 (Sep) = 732,000 +300,000 (Dec) = 1,032,000.

Total quantity: 27,000 +50,000=77,000 +35,000=112,000 +40,000=152,000.

Average cost per bolt = 1,032,000 /152,000.

Let me compute 1,032,000 ÷152,000.

Divide numerator and denominator by 1000: 1032 /152.

Now, 152 ×6=912. 1032-912=120. 120/152=0.789 approx. So 6.789, which is ≈6.79 per bolt.

So 44,000 bolts ×6.79= 44,000*6=264,000, 44,000*0.79=34, 760. So total $298,760.

Looking at the options, option G says average cost: $298.76, but that's per bolt. Wait, but option G's average cost is $298.76, which would make the total way too high. Wait, perhaps the options are giving the average cost per unit. Wait, no, because in the problem, the total inventory is 44,000 units. So for example, if the average cost per unit is $6.79, then total is 44,000 ×6.79= $298,760, which is option G's first value. But option G says average cost: $298.76, which is the total, not per unit. Wait, but the option says "Average cost: $298.76", which would be the total, but that's not how average cost is usually presented. Average cost is per unit.

So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, maybe the options are giving the average cost per unit, but in the options, the average cost is given as, for example, option G: $298.76, which would be way too high. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe I should compute the average cost correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the total cost and then the average cost per unit.

Wait, total cost is $1,032,000 for 152,000 units. So average cost is 1,032,000 /152,000 = 6.789 per unit.

So ending inventory is 44,000 *6.789≈44,000*6.79=298,760.

Looking at the options, the average cost option that matches is option G: Average cost: $298.76. Wait, but that's per unit? No, because 44,000 *298.76 would be way too high. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: Average cost: $310.00, FIFO: $360, LIFO: $260.00

B: Average cost: $275.50, FIFO: $305, LIFO: $245.00

C: Average cost: $320.00, FIFO: $370, LIFO: $270.00

D: Average cost: $285.00, FIFO: $335, LIFO: $235.00

E: Average cost: $350.00, FIFO: $400, LIFO: $300.00

F: Average cost: $305.00, FIFO: $355, LIFO: $255.00

G: Average cost: $298.76, FIFO: $328, LIFO: $272.50

H: Average cost: $400.00, FIFO: $450, LIFO: $350.00

I: Average cost: $250.00, FIFO: $300, LIFO: $200.00

J: Average cost: $290.00, FIFO: $340, LIFO: $240.00

Wait, option G's average cost is $298.76. But that's the total, not per unit. Because 44,000 *6.79=298,760, which is $298,760, but option G has average cost as $298.76, which would be about 44,000 *6.79≈298,760, but option G's average cost is $298.76, which would mean 44,000 *298.76= way too high. So perhaps the options are giving the average cost per unit, but that would mean the average cost per unit is around $6.79, which is not matching any of the options except perhaps option G's average cost is $298.76, which is way higher. So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating total cost. Let me recalculate:

Jan 1: 27,000 *6=162,000.

Mar 12:50,000 *6.5=325,000.

Sep 11:35,000 *7=245,000.

Dec 3:40,000 *7.5=300,000.

Adding these up: 162k +325k=487k +245k=732k +300k=1,032k. So total cost is $1,032,000.

Total units:27k+50k=77k +35k=112k +40k=152k. So 152,000 units.

Average cost per unit: 1,032,000 /152,000=6.789≈6.79.

So ending inventory is 44,000 *6.79=298,760.

Looking at the options, option G's average cost is $298.76, which is close to $298,760, but that would be the total value, not per unit. So perhaps the options are giving the total value under each method.

Wait, but in the options, the average cost value is $298.76, which would be the total inventory value. So that would match what I calculated. So average cost method gives $298,760, which is option G's first value: average cost: $298.76.

Now, moving on to FIFO.

FIFO assumes that the oldest inventory is sold first. So the first in, first out.

We start with 27,000 bolts at $6.00.

Then, March 12:50,000 at $6.50.

Then, Sept 11:35,000 at $7.00.

Then, Dec 3:40,000 at $7.50.

Ending inventory is 44,000. So we need to see how much of each purchase is left.

Let's track the flow.

Starting with 27,000 (Jan). Then March adds 50k, so total is 77k. Then Sept adds 35k, total 112k. Then Dec adds 40k, total 152k.

Ending inventory is 44k.

So under FIFO, the last 44k would be the last purchases.

But wait, FIFO assumes that the earliest purchased items are sold first, so the ending inventory would consist of the most recent purchases.

So let's see: total available is 152k, ending inventory is 44k. So the oldest 152k -44k=108k have been sold.

So the ending inventory would consist of the most recent 44k.

But let's break it down:

After Jan: 27k.

After March: 27k +50k=77k.

After Sept:77k +35k=112k.

After Dec:112k +40k=152k.

Ending inventory is 44k. So the 44k would be the most recent 44k, i.e., from Dec 3 purchase, but wait, Dec 3 is 40k. So perhaps it's 40k from Dec and then 4k from Sept.

Wait, let me think.

FIFO: the oldest inventory is sold first.

So the order of depletion is:

First, Jan 1:27k sold.

Then March 12:50k sold.

Then Sept 11:35k sold.

Then Dec 3:40k sold.

But since total sold is 108k, we need to see how much is left in each purchase.

Let me compute the units sold from each purchase.

Start with Jan 1:27k.

After selling 27k, remaining is 0 from Jan.

Then, from March 12:50k. We can sell 50k, but we need to reach 108k sold. So after Jan, we have 27k sold, remaining to sell 108k-27k=81k.

From March 12, we have 50k available. So we can sell all 50k, which brings total sold to 27k+50k=77k. Remaining to sell:108k-77k=31k.

Next, from Sept 11:35k available. We can sell 31k, leaving 35k-31k=4k in Sept 11 purchase.

So now, total sold is 77k+31k=108k. So the remaining inventory is:

Jan 1:0.

March 12:0.

Sept 11:4k.

Dec 3:40k.

So total inventory is 4k +40k=44k, which matches.

So the inventory consists of 4k from Sept and 40k from Dec.

So the value is:

4k *7.00=28,000.

40k *7.50=300,000.

Total FIFO value=28,000 +300,000=328,000.

Looking at the options, option G's FIFO is $328, which matches.

Now, LIFO: last in, first out.

This assumes that the most recent purchases are sold first.

So ending inventory would consist of the earliest purchases.

Let me track:

Total available is 152k, ending inventory 44k. So 152k -44k=108k sold.

LIFO: the most recent inventory is sold first.

So the order is:

Dec 3:40k, then Sept 11:35k, then March 12:50k, then Jan 1:27k.

So let's see how much is sold from each.

Start with Dec 3:40k. Sell all 40k, sold=40k. Remaining to sell:108k-40k=68k.

Next, Sept 11:35k. Sell all 35k, sold=40k+35k=75k. Remaining to sell:108k-75k=33k.

Next, March 12:50k. Sell 33k, leaving 50k-33k=17k. So sold from March 12 is 33k.

Now, total sold is 40k+35k+33k=108k. So the remaining inventory is:

Jan 1:27k.

March 12:17k.

Sept 11:0.

Dec 3:0.

So total inventory is 27k +17k=44k.

So the value is:

27k *6.00=162,000.

17k *6.50=110,500.

Total LIFO value=162,000 +110,500=272,500.

Looking at the options, option G's LIFO is $272.50. Wait, no, option G says LIFO: $272.50, but the total is 272,500, which is $272.50 per unit? No, because 44,000 *6.2 (approx) is not matching. Wait, no, the total is $272,500, which would be 44,000 units. So option G's LIFO is $272.50, but that would be the total, not per unit. So the value is $272,500, which is option G's LIFO of $272.50? Wait, no, $272,500 is the total, but option G's LIFO is $272.50, which would be per unit. That can't be right because 44,000 *6.2=272,800 approx, but my calculation is $272,500. So option G's LIFO is $272.50, which is the total? But the options present it as $272.50, so perhaps it's the total. So option G's LIFO is $272.50, which matches our calculation of $272,500. But wait, that's a comma vs period confusion. In the US, it's periods for decimals. So option G's LIFO is $272.50, which would be the total, but that's not possible because 44k *6.2 is around 272k. So perhaps the options are in thousands, but that's not clear.

Wait, no, in the options, the numbers are presented as, for example, option G: average cost: $298.76, FIFO: $328, LIFO: $272.50. So these are the total values, not per unit.

Wait, but 44,000 *6.79=298,760, which is the average cost total. So option G's average cost is $298.76, which would be the total. So the way the options are presented, each method's value is the total, not per unit.

So, under FIFO, the total is $328,000, which would be option G's FIFO: $328.

Under LIFO, total is $272,500, which would be option G's LIFO: $272.50.

So the correct option is G: average cost: $298.76, FIFO: $328, LIFO: $272.50.
</think>

To determine the value of the December 31 inventory for Pinson's Wholesale Hardware Company, we analyze the data using three inventory valuation methods: average cost, FIFO, and LIFO.

### **1. Average Cost Method**
- **Total Cost Calculation**:  
  - January 1 (beginning inventory): $27,000 × $6.00 = $162,000  
  - March 12 purchase: $50,000 × $6.50 = $325,000  
  - September 11 purchase: $35,000 × $7.00 = $245,000  
  - December 3 purchase: $40,000 × $7.50 = $300,000  
  - **Total Cost**: $162,000 + $325,000 + $245,000 + $300,000 = **$1,032,000**  

- **Total Quantity**:  
  - 27,000 + 50,000 + 35,000 + 40,000 = **152,000 bolts**  

- **Average Cost per Bolt**:  
  - $1,032,000 ÷ 152,000 ≈ **$6.79**  

- **Value of Ending Inventory (44,000 bolts)**:  
  - 44,000 × $6.79 ≈ **$298,760**  

### **2. FIFO Method**
- **Ending Inventory Composition**:  
  - The oldest inventory is sold first, so the ending inventory consists of the most recent purchases.  
  - December 3 purchase: 40,000 bolts × $7.50 = $300,000  
  - September 11 purchase: 4,000 bolts × $7.00 = $28,000  
  - **Total FIFO Value**: $300,000 + $28,000 = **$328,000**  

### **3. LIFO Method**
- **Ending Inventory Composition**:  
  - The most recent inventory is sold first, so the ending inventory consists of the oldest purchases.  
  - January 1 (beginning inventory): 27,000 bolts × $6.00 = $162,000  
  - March 12 purchase: 17,000 bolts × $6.50 = $110,500  
  - **Total LIFO Value**: $162,000 + $110,500 = **$272,500**  

### **Final Answer**
- **Average Cost**: $298,760  
- **FIFO**: $328,000  
- **LIFO**: $272,500  

**Matching Option**: **G**  

**Answer: G**
