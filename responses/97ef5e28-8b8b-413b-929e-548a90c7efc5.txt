Question:

Thomas and Chess’s (1977) “goodness-of-fit” model predicts that maladjustment in children is due to:

Options:

A: a mismatch between the child's academic abilities and his/her parents' expectations.
B: inconsistencies in the child's perception of self-worth and the feedback received from teachers.
C: inconsistencies in the child's communication skills and the feedback received from peers.
D: inconsistencies in the parenting styles of the child’s caregivers.
E: a mismatch between the child's physical activity levels and his/her parents' encouragement of physical activity.
F: a mismatch between the child's emotional needs and his/her parents' emotional availability.
G: inconsistencies in the child's peer group and their influence on the child's behavior.
H: inconsistencies in the child’s sense of self and the feedback the child receives from caregivers about his/her behavior.
I: a mismatch between the child’s basic temperament and his/her parents’ childrearing practices.
J: a mismatch between the child’s attachment behaviors and his/her parents’ response to those behaviors.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Thomas and Chess's (1977) "goodness-of-fit" model. I remember that this model is about how children's development is influenced by the interaction between their temperament and their environment, particularly their parents' childrearing practices.

The question is asking which factor leads to maladjustment in children according to this model. The options are A through J, each proposing a different mismatch or inconsistency.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Mismatch between the child's academic abilities and parents' expectations. Hmm, I think the goodness-of-fit model is more about temperament and how parents respond, not so much about academic abilities. So maybe A isn't the right one.

Option B: Inconsistencies in the child's self-worth and teacher feedback. This seems more related to school interactions rather than the parent-child dynamic, which is the focus of the model. So probably not B.

Option C: Inconsistencies in communication skills and peer feedback. Again, this is about peers, and the model is more about the child's primary caregivers. So C might not be it.

Option D: Inconsistencies in parenting styles. Wait, the model talks about the fit between the child's temperament and the parenting style. If the parenting is inconsistent, that could cause issues. But I'm not sure if this is exactly what the model predicts as the cause of maladjustment.

Option E: Mismatch between physical activity levels and parents' encouragement. This seems too specific. The model is broader, focusing more on general temperament and care practices, not just physical activity.

Option F: Mismatch between emotional needs and parents' emotional availability. That sounds more aligned. If the child's emotional needs aren't met by the parents, that could lead to maladjustment. But wait, isn't this more about emotional availability than the overall fit?

Option G: Inconsistencies in peer group influence. Again, this is about peers, not parents. So probably not G.

Option H: Inconsistencies in the child's sense of self and feedback from caregivers. This seems related, but I think the model is more about the interaction between the child's temperament and the parents' practices, not the child's self-concept.

Option I: Mismatch between child's basic temperament and parents' childrearing practices. This rings a bell. The goodness-of-fit model suggests that if a child's temperament doesn't align with the parents' parenting style, it can lead to maladjustment. So I think I is the correct answer.

Option J: Mismatch between attachment behaviors and parents' responses. This seems close, but I think it's more about the attachment theory, not exactly the goodness-of-fit model. The model is broader, focusing on general fit, not just attachment.

So, putting it all together, the answer should be I because the model emphasizes the interaction between the child's temperament and how the parents rear the child. If there's a mismatch here, maladjustment is more likely.

The goodness-of-fit model by Thomas and Chess (1977) emphasizes the interaction between a child's temperament and their parents' childrearing practices. Maladjustment occurs when there is a mismatch between the child's inherent characteristics (temperament) and the parenting style provided by the caregivers. Among the options, the most accurate description aligns with option I, which highlights this mismatch as the cause of maladjustment.

Answer: I
