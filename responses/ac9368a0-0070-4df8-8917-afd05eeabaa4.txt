Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is asking: What is the probability that a randomly selected integer in the set {1,2,3,…,100} is divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3? I need to express the answer as a common fraction, and then choose the correct option from A to J.

Alright, let's break this down. Probability is generally the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. Here, the total number of possible outcomes is 100 because the set goes from 1 to 100.

Now, the favorable outcomes are the numbers that are divisible by 2 but not by 3. So, I need to find how many numbers between 1 and 100 are even (divisible by 2) and not multiples of 3.

First, let's find how many numbers between 1 and 100 are divisible by 2. Well, every second number is even, so that's 100 divided by 2, which is 50. So there are 50 numbers divisible by 2.

But now, among these 50 numbers, some are also divisible by 3, and we want to exclude those. So I need to find how many numbers between 1 and 100 are divisible by both 2 and 3. Since 2 and 3 are coprime, their least common multiple is 6. So numbers divisible by both 2 and 3 are the numbers divisible by 6.

To find how many numbers between 1 and 100 are divisible by 6, I can divide 100 by 6. Let's calculate that: 100 ÷ 6 is approximately 16.666. But since we're dealing with whole numbers, we take the integer part, which is 16. So there are 16 numbers divisible by 6.

Wait, let me check: 6×16=96, which is less than 100. The next multiple would be 6×17=102, which is beyond 100. So yes, 16 numbers are divisible by 6.

So now, the number of favorable outcomes is the numbers divisible by 2 minus those divisible by both 2 and 3, which is 50 - 16 = 34.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that. If there are 50 even numbers and 16 of them are also multiples of 3, then subtracting 16 from 50 should give me the count of even numbers not divisible by 3. So 50 - 16 = 34. Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see 34/100 as an option. The options are A:17/31, B:33/66, C:33/100, D:17/50, E:1/6, F:17/66, G:1/3, H:31/66, I:31/100, J:17/100.

Wait, 34/100 can be simplified. 34 and 100 are both divisible by 2, so dividing numerator and denominator by 2 gives 17/50. That's option D. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations.

Let me recount. Total numbers: 100.

Numbers divisible by 2: floor(100/2) = 50.

Numbers divisible by 6: floor(100/6) = 16 (since 6×16=96, as I thought).

So numbers divisible by 2 but not by 3: 50 - 16 = 34.

So probability is 34/100 = 17/50, which is option D.

Wait, but let me make sure. Another way to think about it is using inclusion-exclusion. The count of numbers divisible by 2 or 3 is equal to the count of numbers divisible by 2 plus the count of numbers divisible by 3 minus the count of numbers divisible by both. But actually, we don't need that here because we're looking for numbers divisible by 2 and not by 3.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate it using probabilities. The probability that a number is divisible by 2 is 1/2. The probability that a number is divisible by 3 is 1/3. The probability that a number is divisible by both 2 and 3 is 1/6. So the probability that a number is divisible by 2 but not by 3 is (1/2) - (1/6) = (3/6 - 1/6) = 2/6 = 1/3. Wait, that's 1/3, which is approximately 0.3333, which would be 33.333.../100. But that would be 33 or 34 numbers.

Wait, but earlier I got 34 numbers. 34/100 is 0.34, which is close to 1/3 (0.3333). But 34 is an exact count, so 34/100 reduces to 17/50, which is 0.34. So that's correct.

Wait, but in the options, option C is 33/100, which is 0.33, and option D is 17/50, which is 0.34. So which one is correct?

Wait, let me recount the numbers divisible by 6 up to 100. 6×1=6, 6×2=12,...,6×16=96. So 16 numbers. So 50-16=34. So 34 numbers. So 34/100 is correct, which simplifies to 17/50. So the correct answer is D:17/50.

But wait, another way to think: perhaps I should calculate how many numbers between 1 and 100 are even and not multiples of 3. Alternatively, for each even number, check if it's not a multiple of 3.

But that's more tedious, but maybe let me consider the pattern.

The even numbers are 2,4,6,8,...,100.

Now, among these, every third even number is a multiple of 6, since 6 is 2×3. So in the even numbers, the multiples of 6 occur every 3rd even number. So how many such numbers are there?

We have 50 even numbers. The number of multiples of 6 is floor(50/3) = 16, because 3×16=48, and 50-48=2, so 16 multiples of 6. So again, 50-16=34.

So yes, 34 numbers. So 34/100=17/50, which is option D.

Wait, but looking back, the options don't include 34/100. They have 33/100 as option C. Did I miscalculate?

Wait, let me check the count of numbers divisible by 6 up to 100 again. 6×16=96, which is less than 100. 6×17=102>100, so 16 numbers. So 50-16=34. So 34, which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about being divisible by 2 and not by 3, but perhaps I should use the inclusion-exclusion principle differently.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the probability as P(divisible by 2) minus P(divisible by both 2 and 3). So P(divisible by 2) is 50/100=1/2. P(divisible by both 2 and 3) is 16/100=4/25. So 1/2 - 4/25= (25/50 - 16/50)=9/50=0.18. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I had 34/100=17/50=0.34. So that's a contradiction.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in the calculation here. Let me recalculate. Wait, 16/100 is 0.16, not 4/25, which is 0.16. So 1/2 is 0.5, minus 0.16 is 0.34, which is 34/100, which is correct. So yes, that's consistent.

So the correct count is 34, so the probability is 34/100=17/50, which is option D.

Wait, but the option C is 33/100, which is 0.33. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting the multiples of 6. Let me check again.

The multiples of 6 up to 100: 6×1=6, 6×2=12, 6×3=18,...,6×16=96. So 16 numbers. 6×17=102, which is beyond 100. So that's correct. So 16 numbers.

So 50 even numbers minus 16 multiples of 6 gives 34 numbers that are even and not multiples of 3. So 34/100=17/50, which is option D.

But let me check another approach. Let's consider the numbers from 1 to 100. The numbers that are even are 2,4,6,...,100. Now, among these, the numbers not divisible by 3 are those even numbers where when divided by 2, the result is not divisible by 3. So, in other words, numbers of the form 2k where k is not divisible by 3.

So the total number of k's from 1 to 50 (since 2×50=100) is 50. Now, how many k's are not divisible by 3? Well, the numbers from 1 to 50 divisible by 3 are floor(50/3)=16 (since 3×16=48). So the numbers not divisible by 3 are 50-16=34. So 34 numbers, which again gives 34/100=17/50. So that's consistent.

So the correct answer is D:17/50.
</think>

The probability is calculated by finding the count of numbers divisible by 2 but not by 3 in the set {1,2,...,100}. There are 50 even numbers and 16 multiples of 6. Subtracting these gives 34 favorable outcomes, leading to a probability of 34/100, which simplifies to 17/50.
