Okay, so I have this trigonometry question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is: If we take sin x and change it to 3 sin 2x, what will happen to the domain and range of the function?

The options are from A to J, each describing a change in the domain and range.

Alright, I remember that the sine function, sin x, has a domain of all real numbers because sine is defined everywhere. The range is from -1 to 1 because the sine of any angle is between those values.

Now, the original function is sin x. Let's think about what happens when we change it to 3 sin 2x.

First, let's break down the transformation. The general form for a sine function is A sin(Bx + C) + D. In this case, 3 sin(2x) would be A=3, B=2, C=0, D=0. So, what do A and B do?

A affects the amplitude, which is the height from the midline. The original amplitude of sin x is 1, and multiplying by 3 would make the amplitude 3. So the range would go from -3 to 3. That means the range is tripled. So the range changes from [-1,1] to [-3,3], so it's tripled. So the range is tripled.

Next, B affects the period. The period of sin x is 2π. The period of sin(Bx) is 2π/B. So when B is 2, the period becomes 2π/2 = π. So the function completes a full cycle in half the length. That affects the domain in terms of how often the function repeats.

Wait, but the domain of a function is all real numbers unless specified otherwise. For sin x, the domain is all real numbers. Changing it to 3 sin 2x doesn't restrict the domain; it's still defined for all real x. So the domain remains the same as before, which is all real numbers.

So to recap: the domain doesn't change, it's still all real numbers. The range changes from [-1,1] to [-3,3], which is tripled.

Looking back at the options:

A: Domain same; range tripled. That fits.

B: Both same. No, because range changes.

C: Domain halved; range tripled. Domain isn't halved—it's the same.

D: Domain tripled; range halved. No, opposite changes.

E: Domain double; range same. No, domain is the same.

F: Domain doubled; range tripled. No, domain same.

G: Domain tripled; range doubled. No.

H: Domain same; range doubled. No, because it's tripled.

I: Both doubled. No.

J: Both tripled. No, domain same.

So the correct answer is A: Domain is the same; range is tripled.

The function's domain remains all real numbers, while the range is tripled due to the amplitude increase.
