Okay, so I've got this physics problem about electromagnetic induction. Hmm, I remember that when the magnetic field through a coil changes, it induces an electromotive force (EMF) in the coil. Faraday's Law is involved here, right? Let me try to recall the formula.

Faraday's Law states that the induced EMF is equal to the negative rate of change of magnetic flux through the coil. The formula is EMF = -N * (ΔΦ/Δt), where N is the number of turns, and ΔΦ is the change in magnetic flux over time Δt.

Magnetic flux Φ is given by Φ = B * A * cosθ. In this problem, the magnetic field is perpendicular to the coil, so θ is 0 degrees, and cosθ is 1. That simplifies things.

The coil has an area A of 0.2 m², and there are N = 250 turns. The magnetic field goes from B_initial = 0.01 T to B_final = 0.06 T. The time interval Δt is 0.25 seconds.

So, the change in flux ΔΦ is Φ_final - Φ_initial. Since Φ = B*A, ΔΦ = A*(B_final - B_initial). Let me plug in the numbers: A is 0.2 m², B_final is 0.06 T, B_initial is 0.01 T. So ΔΦ = 0.2*(0.06 - 0.01) = 0.2*(0.05) = 0.01 Weber.

Now, the average induced EMF is N * (ΔΦ / Δt). So ΔΦ is 0.01 Wb, and Δt is 0.25 s. So ΔΦ/Δt is 0.01 / 0.25 = 0.04 Wb/s. Multiply by N=250: 250 * 0.04 = 10 V.

Wait, but the options don't have 10 V as the first choice. Let me check the options again. Oh, option G is 10 V. But wait, did I miss a negative sign? Oh, right, the EMF has a negative sign indicating the direction, but the question asks for the magnitude, so the average induced EMF is 10 V. So the correct answer should be G:10 V.

Wait, but looking again, I'm a bit confused. Did I calculate correctly? Let me double-check. ΔB is 0.05 T. 0.05 T over 0.25 s is 0.2 T/s. Multiply by area (0.2 m²) gives 0.04 Wb/s. Then multiply by 250 turns: 0.04 *250 = 10 V. Yep, that's right. So the answer is G.

The average induced EMF is calculated using Faraday's Law: EMF = N * (ΔΦ/Δt). The change in magnetic flux ΔΦ is 0.01 Wb, and the time interval Δt is 0.25 s. Dividing these gives 0.04 Wb/s. Multiplying by the number of turns (250) results in an EMF of 10 V. 

Answer: G
