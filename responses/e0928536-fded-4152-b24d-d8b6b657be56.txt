Okay, so I need to figure out the correct fiscal policy to remedy inflation. Let me start by recalling what I know about fiscal policy and inflation.

Fiscal policy refers to the government's use of spending and taxation to influence the economy. There are two main tools: government spending and taxes. The goal when dealing with inflation is to reduce it, so the policy should aim to decrease aggregate demand.

Inflation occurs when the general price level rises, which can be caused by too much money chasing too few goods, or when demand outstrips supply. To combat this, the government needs to reduce demand. How do they do that?

I remember that contractionary fiscal policy is used to reduce inflation. This involves decreasing government spending and/or increasing taxes. When the government spends less, it takes money out of the economy, reducing demand. Similarly, increasing taxes leaves people with less disposable income, also reducing spending.

Looking at the options:

A: Decreased government spending and increased taxes. This seems like contractionary policy, which should help reduce inflation.

B: Decrease money supply. Wait, that's actually a monetary policy action, not fiscal. The federal government doesn't control the money supply directly; that's the job of the central bank, like the Fed. So B might not be the right answer here.

C: Run a deficit. A deficit occurs when spending exceeds revenues. That would mean the government is injecting more money into the economy, which would likely increase inflation, not reduce it. So C is probably not correct.

D: Decreased taxes and increased spending. This would be expansionary fiscal policy, which would stimulate the economy and possibly worsen inflation. So D is not the answer.

E: Increase money supply. Again, that's monetary policy, not fiscal. So E is likely incorrect.

F: Increased spending and decreased taxes. This is also expansionary, which would increase demand and inflation. So F is not right.

G: Run a surplus. A surplus means the government is taking more money out of the economy than it's putting in. This is contractionary, which would help reduce inflation. So G is a possible answer.

H: Balanced budget. This means spending equals revenues, so no net change. It might not have a significant impact on inflation, so H might not be the best option.

I: Decreased spending and taxes. So this is like option A but without increasing taxes. It's also contractionary, which would help. So I is another possible answer.

J: Increased taxes and spending. Wait, that's contradictory because increased taxes would reduce disposable income, but increased spending would add to the money supply. It's a bit confusing. I think J is trying to say both, but it's not clear if it's a net contraction or expansion. Maybe it's contractionary since taxes are up, but spending is also up, so it's unclear. Not sure, but I think J is less likely.

Now, the options that seem correct are A, G, and I.

But wait, the question asks for the appropriate fiscal policy. Let's think about what each option represents.

Option A: Decreased spending and increased taxes. Both are contractionary, which should reduce inflation.

Option G: Running a surplus. That's also contractionary because the government is taking more in taxes than it spends, effectively removing money from the economy.

Option I: Decreased spending and taxes. So both spending and taxes are down, which would be expansionary, right? Wait, no. If the government decreases both, it's putting more money into the economy because taxes are lower (people have more money) and spending is lower (government is buying less). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, if the government decreases its spending, it takes money out of the economy. If it also decreases taxes, it puts money back in. So the net effect depends on which is stronger. But in this case, the question is about remediating inflation, so we need a contractionary policy. So option I is actually a mix that may not be contractionary. Let me think again.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

Contractionary fiscal policy aims to reduce aggregate demand. It can be done by decreasing government spending, increasing taxes, or both. If the government decreases spending, that's contractionary. If it increases taxes, that's also contractionary. So A is contractionary (decrease spending, increase taxes). G is running a surplus, which is a form of contractionary policy because the government is taking more in taxes than it spends, effectively reducing the money supply.

So both A and G are contractionary. But which one is the appropriate fiscal policy? The question is a bit ambiguous because it's asking for the appropriate policy, not the specific tool.

Wait, the options are about the fiscal policy approach. So which is the correct fiscal policy to remedy inflation? The correct approach is contractionary fiscal policy, which involves either cutting spending, raising taxes, or both. So both A and G are contractionary, but the options are separate.

Looking back at the options, option A is decreased spending and increased taxes, which is a contractionary approach. Option G is running a surplus, which is also contractionary because the government is taking more money out than it's putting in.

But the question is about the appropriate fiscal policy. I think the standard answer is that to combat inflation, the government should decrease spending and/or increase taxes, leading to a surplus. So both A and G are correct in a way. But looking at the options, the correct answer is likely A because it's a direct contractionary measure, but G is also correct.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option A is decreased spending and increased taxes, which is contractionary. Option G is running a surplus, which is the result of contractionary fiscal policy. So which is the policy itself?

The question asks for the appropriate fiscal policy, which would be the action taken, not the result. So the policy is to decrease spending and/or increase taxes. So A is a specific policy action. G is the outcome of that policy.

Therefore, the correct answer is A: decreased government spending and increased taxes.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the answer is running a surplus. Let me think of examples. During the 1980s, the US had high inflation. Paul Volcker at the Fed used contractionary monetary policy, but the fiscal policy under Reagan was expansionary (tax cuts, increased spending), which might have worsened things. So in that case, the correct fiscal policy would have been contractionary.

So the correct fiscal policy is contractionary, which would be either A or G.

Wait, the options are:

A: decreased spending, increased taxes.

G: run a surplus.

I think both are correct, but perhaps the question is looking for the policy action, not the outcome. So the policy is to decrease spending and increase taxes, which is option A.

Alternatively, running a surplus is also a contractionary policy, but it's the result of the policy actions. So the fiscal policy tool is A, and the outcome would be G.

But the question is about the appropriate fiscal policy, so the action is A.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The fiscal policy to combat inflation is contractionary, which can be achieved by decreasing government spending, increasing taxes, or both. So the answer is A.

Another way: If the government decreases spending and increases taxes, it's reducing the money supply, which lowers demand and reduces inflation. So A is correct.

The appropriate fiscal policy to remedy inflation involves reducing aggregate demand, which can be achieved through contractionary measures. This includes decreasing government spending and/or increasing taxes. Option A directly reflects this approach by advocating for decreased government spending and increased taxes, both of which reduce demand and help combat inflation. While running a surplus (Option G) is a result of contractionary fiscal policy, the question asks for the policy itself, making Option A the correct choice.

Answer: A
