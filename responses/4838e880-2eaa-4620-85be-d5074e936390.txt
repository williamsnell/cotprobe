Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about whether the set of all real numbers under usual multiplication forms a group. The question says it's not a group because of one of the given options. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that a group must satisfy four properties: closure, associativity, identity element, and inverses for each element. Let me go through each of these to see where the real numbers under multiplication fail.

Closure means that if I take any two real numbers and multiply them, the result is still a real number. Well, real numbers multiplied together always give a real number, so closure holds. So options that mention closure not being an issue can be dismissed. Looking at the options, G says the set isn't closed under multiplication, but that's not true, so G is incorrect.

Next, associativity. Multiplication of real numbers is associative, right? Because (a * b) * c equals a * (b * c) for any real numbers a, b, c. So A, which says multiplication isn't associative, is wrong.

Now, the identity element. In multiplication, the identity element is 1 because any real number multiplied by 1 gives itself. So the identity exists, which rules out option F, which says the identity doesn't exist.

Moving on to inverses. For every real number a, there should be an inverse element b such that a * b = 1. But wait, zero is a real number, and there's no real number that when multiplied by zero gives 1. So zero doesn't have an inverse. That means the set isn't closed under taking inverses because one element (zero) doesn't have an inverse. Looking at the options, J says zero has no inverse, which seems correct. But let me check other options too.

Option B says negative numbers have no inverse. But that's not true because every negative number a has an inverse which is 1/a, which is also a real number. So B is incorrect.

Option J is about zero, which is correct. So why is option J the right answer?

Wait, let me make sure. The question is why the set isn't a group. Since zero doesn't have an inverse under multiplication, that means not every element has an inverse, which is a requirement for a group. So the correct reason is J.

But wait, another thought: sometimes the problem might be about the entire set. So if even one element lacks an inverse, the set fails the inverse property, making it not a group. So J is the right answer.

Wait, but let me check if I've missed anything. The options also include H, which says multiplication isn't commutative. But real numbers are commutative under multiplication, so H is wrong.

So the main issue is that zero doesn't have an inverse, so J is correct.

The set of all real numbers under multiplication fails to be a group because zero does not have an inverse under this operation. Every element in a group must have an inverse, but since there is no real number that can be multiplied by zero to yield the identity element (1), the set does not satisfy the inverse property. Therefore, the correct answer is:

J
