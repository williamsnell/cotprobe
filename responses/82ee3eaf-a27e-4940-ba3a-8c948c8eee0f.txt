Okay, so I've got this economics question here about marginal cost and average variable cost. I'm a bit rusty on my microeconomics, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking where marginal cost (MC) always intersects average variable cost (AVC). The options are A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that both MC and AVC are cost curves that businesses use in production. AVC is the average variable cost per unit, calculated by dividing total variable costs by the quantity produced. MC, on the other hand, is the additional cost incurred by producing one more unit.

I think about the shapes of these curves. AVC starts high when production is low, then decreases as production increases (due to economies of scale), reaches a minimum, and then starts increasing again because of diminishing returns. MC, on the other hand, typically starts low, increases as production increases, and intersects the AVC curve at some point.

Wait, I recall that MC intersects AVC at the minimum point of AVC. Why? Because when MC is equal to AVC, that's the point where the AVC curve stops decreasing and starts increasing. So, the intersection occurs at the minimum of AVC. That makes sense because before that point, MC is below AVC, meaning adding more units reduces the average cost. After that point, MC is above AVC, meaning each additional unit starts increasing the average cost.

Looking at the options, option G says "the minimum of average variable cost." That seems to fit what I'm thinking. Let me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something.

Option A is about the minimum of average total cost (ATC), which is related but different. ATC includes both fixed and variable costs, whereas AVC is just variable. The MC curve also intersects ATC at its minimum, but the question is specifically about AVC.

Option C is the profit-maximizing quantity, which is where MC equals marginal revenue (MR), not necessarily where MC intersects AVC.

Options D and J talk about maxima, which don't make sense because MC and AVC are typically U-shaped, so their minima are more relevant.

Option F is where MC equals average total cost, which is a different point than where MC meets AVC.

So, I'm pretty confident now that the correct answer is G: the minimum of average variable cost.

The correct answer is G: the minimum of average variable cost. Marginal cost (MC) intersects average variable cost (AVC) at the minimum point of AVC because that's where AVC stops decreasing and starts increasing. This occurs when MC equals AVC, marking the point of minimum average variable cost.

Answer: G
