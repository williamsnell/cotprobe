Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the mass of water needed when adding 293 grams of NaCl to get a 0.25 molal solution. The formula weight of NaCl is given as 58.5 g/mol. The options are A through J, with various kilograms of H2O.

Hmm, I remember that molality is a measure of concentration, specifically the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. So molality (m) equals moles of solute divided by kilograms of solvent. So m = moles / kg solvent.

Wait, so I need to find the kg of solvent (water) when I have a certain mass of solute (NaCl) and a given molality.

Let me jot down the formula:

m = moles of solute / mass of solvent (in kg)

I need to find the mass of solvent, so rearranging the formula:

mass of solvent = moles of solute / m

But wait, first I need to find the moles of NaCl. Since the mass of NaCl is 293 grams and the formula weight is 58.5 g/mol, I can calculate moles as mass divided by molar mass.

Moles of NaCl = 293 g / 58.5 g/mol.

Let me compute that. 293 divided by 58.5. Hmm, 58.5 times 5 is 292.5. Oh, so 293 is almost exactly 5 moles. Because 5 * 58.5 is 292.5, so 293 is approximately 5.00857 moles. Let's just call it 5.0086 moles for calculation purposes.

Wait, but perhaps I should be more precise. Let me compute it properly.

58.5 * 5 = 292.5. So 293 g is 5 + (0.5/58.5) moles. 0.5 divided by 58.5 is about 0.00855. So total moles â‰ˆ 5.00855. Let's approximate to 5.0086 moles.

Now, the molality is given as 0.25 m. So using m = moles / kg solvent,

kg solvent = moles / m = 5.0086 / 0.25.

Dividing 5.0086 by 0.25 is the same as multiplying by 4. So 5.0086 *4 = 20.0344 kg.

Wait, so that's approximately 20.0344 kg of water. Looking at the options, option C is 20 kg. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I calculate the moles correctly?

Yes, 293 /58.5. Let me compute that again. 58.5 *5 is 292.5, so 293 is 5 + 0.5/58.5. 0.5/58.5 is approximately 0.00855, so 5.00855 moles. That's correct.

Then, 5.00855 divided by 0.25 is 20.0342 kg, which is about 20 kg. So the correct option is C: 20 kg H2O.

Wait, but wait another thing. Molality is moles of solute per kg of solvent. So in this case, the solvent is water, and the solute is NaCl. So when they ask for the mass of water, that's the solvent's mass. So yes, I think that's correct.

Alternatively, another way: 0.25 molal means 0.25 moles of NaCl per kg of water. So if I have 5.0086 moles, then the required kg of water is 5.0086 /0.25 = 20.0344 kg, which rounds to 20 kg. So option C is the answer.

The problem involves calculating the mass of water needed to dissolve 293 g of NaCl to form a 0.25 molal solution. Molality (m) is defined as moles of solute divided by the mass of solvent in kilograms. 

First, calculate the moles of NaCl:  
\[
\text{Moles of NaCl} = \frac{293 \, \text{g}}{58.5 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 5.0086 \, \text{moles}.
\]

Using the molality formula:  
\[
m = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{kg of solvent}},
\]  
we rearrange to find the mass of solvent:  
\[
\text{kg of solvent} = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{m} = \frac{5.0086}{0.25} \approx 20.0344 \, \text{kg}.
\]

Rounding to the nearest option, the mass of water required is approximately **20 kg**.
