Okay, so I have this question here about the two principles that deal with questions of values. The options are A through I, each pairing two things. Let's try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It's about principles related to values. So, I'm thinking about what areas or fields deal with values. Values are about what's important to people, right? Things like honesty, fairness, kindness, etc. So which principles do we use to determine or discuss these values?

Looking at the options:

A: faith and science
B: faith and legal
C: religion and science
D: religion and ethics
E: legal and ethics
F: science and legal
G: faith and religion
H: legal and religion
I: ethics and science

Hmm. Let's break down each pair.

Faith and science (A): Faith is more about belief systems, often religious, while science is empirical, based on evidence. Do they deal with values? Maybe, but I'm not sure they're the primary principles for values.

Faith and legal (B): Faith again is a belief system, and legal relates to laws. I'm not sure how these directly relate to values, though laws can reflect societal values.

Religion and science (C): Similar to A, but now it's religion instead of faith. Still, maybe not the main principles for values.

Religion and ethics (D): Ethics is about moral principles. Religion often includes moral teachings, so this seems relevant. Both religion and ethics deal with values, so this is a strong candidate.

Legal and ethics (E): Legal systems are based on laws, which can be influenced by ethics. So yes, they deal with values, but are they the primary principles? Maybe, but I'm not certain.

Science and legal (F): Science is about facts, and legal is about laws. I don't think these are primarily about values.

Faith and religion (G): These are quite similar. Faith is a component of religion, so this might not cover the same ground as a pair.

Legal and religion (H): Similar to B, but focusing more on the legal aspect and religion. Again, not sure if this is the main pair for values.

Ethics and science (I): Ethics is about values, and science is about facts. Not sure how they pair here for values.

So, thinking again, the question is about the two principles that deal with values. Ethics is definitely one because it's all about moral principles. What's the other? Religion often includes moral teachings, so pairing ethics with religion makes sense. That would be option D.

Wait, but could it be legal and ethics (E)? Because laws do reflect societal values. But the question is about principles that deal with values, not just how values are enforced. Ethics is more about the principles themselves, while religion also provides a framework for values. So D seems better.

I think the answer is D: religion and ethics.

The two principles that deal with questions of values are religion and ethics, as both provide frameworks for understanding and guiding moral principles.

Answer: D
