Okay, so I need to figure out the ticket sales revenue for 150 baseball games. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the tickets cost between $10 and $30. So, I should probably take an average price to make an estimate. The average of $10 and $30 is $20. That seems reasonable.

Next, each game is attended by 50,000 to 75,000 people. Again, I'll take the average attendance to estimate. The average of 50k and 75k is 62,500 people per game.

Now, for one game, the revenue would be the number of attendees multiplied by the ticket price. So, 62,500 people times $20 per ticket. Let me calculate that: 62,500 * 20 = $1,250,000 per game.

Since there are 150 games in the season, I'll multiply the per-game revenue by 150. So, $1,250,000 * 150. Hmm, let's see: 1,250,000 * 100 is 125,000,000, and 1,250,000 * 50 is 62,500,000. Adding those together gives 187,500,000. So, approximately $187.5 million.

Looking at the options, the closest one is D: $200,000,000. I think that's a good estimate because I rounded the numbers, but it should be in the ballpark.

To estimate ticket sales revenue for 150 games, calculate the average ticket price and average attendance, then multiply these by the number of games.

Average ticket price = ($10 + $30) / 2 = $20

Average attendance = (50,000 + 75,000) / 2 = 62,500

Revenue per game = 62,500 * $20 = $1,250,000

Total revenue for 150 games = $1,250,000 * 150 = $187,500,000

The closest option is $200,000,000.

Answer: D
