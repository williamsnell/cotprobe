Okay, so I have this logic problem to solve. It's about determining whether a given argument is valid or invalid by constructing a truth table. The argument is:

P ⊃ Q
Q · R / ~P · R

Hmm, I remember that in logic, an argument is valid if every possible truth value assignment to its propositional variables makes the conclusion true whenever all premises are true. If there's even one case where the premises are true and the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid, and that case is a counterexample.

First, let me break down the argument. There are two premises: P implies Q (P ⊃ Q) and Q and R (Q · R). The conclusion is ~P and R (~P · R). So the argument is P ⊃ Q, Q · R ⊢ ~P · R.

I think I should construct the truth table for all possible truth values of P, Q, and R. There are three variables, so there are 2^3 = 8 possible rows.

Let me list all the possible combinations for P, Q, R:

1. P=T, Q=T, R=T
2. P=T, Q=T, R=F
3. P=T, Q=F, R=T
4. P=T, Q=F, R=F
5. P=F, Q=T, R=T
6. P=F, Q=T, R=F
7. P=F, Q=F, R=T
8. P=F, Q=F, R=F

Now, for each row, I need to compute the truth values of the premises and the conclusion.

Wait, the premises are P ⊃ Q and Q · R. So both premises need to be true for the conclusion to potentially be evaluated. If any premise is false, the argument's conclusion doesn't matter because the argument is only about cases where all premises are true.

So the steps are:

1. For each row, compute P ⊃ Q.
2. Compute Q · R.
3. Check if both premises are true (P ⊃ Q is T and Q · R is T).
4. If both are true, then check the conclusion (~P · R). If in any such row, the conclusion is F, then the argument is invalid.

Let me start filling in the table row by row.

Row 1: P=T, Q=T, R=T

P ⊃ Q: T (because T implies T is T)
Q · R: T · T = T
Conclusion: ~P · R: F · T = F

Wait, because ~P is F (since P is T). So conclusion is F.

So in this row, both premises are T, and conclusion is F. That means the argument is invalid because there's a case where premises are true but conclusion is false.

But wait, maybe I should check all rows to see if any other rows also have both premises true but conclusion false.

Let me continue.

Row 2: P=T, Q=T, R=F

P ⊃ Q: T
Q · R: T · F = F
So premise 2 is F. So conclusion doesn't matter here.

Row 3: P=T, Q=F, R=T

P ⊃ Q: F (because T implies F is F)
Q · R: F · T = F
Both premises are F, so conclusion doesn't matter.

Row 4: P=T, Q=F, R=F

P ⊃ Q: F
Q · R: F · F = F
Both premises F.

Row 5: P=F, Q=T, R=T

P ⊃ Q: T (F implies anything is T)
Q · R: T · T = T
Conclusion: ~P · R: T · T = T
So both premises are T, conclusion is T. No problem here.

Row 6: P=F, Q=T, R=F

P ⊃ Q: T
Q · R: T · F = F
Premise 2 is F, so conclusion doesn't matter.

Row 7: P=F, Q=F, R=T

P ⊃ Q: T
Q · R: F · T = F
Premise 2 is F.

Row 8: P=F, Q=F, R=F

P ⊃ Q: T
Q · R: F · F = F
Premise 2 is F.

So the only row where both premises are true is Row 1. In that row, the conclusion is F. Therefore, the argument is invalid because there's a case where the premises are true but the conclusion is false.

Now, looking at the options, the possible answers are A (valid) and B to J (invalid with various counterexamples).

The counterexample is Row 1: P=T, Q=T, R=T.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option B: Invalid. Counterexample when P is false, R is true and Q is false.

Wait, no. In Row 1, P is true, Q is true, R is true. So the counterexample is when P=T, Q=T, R=T.

Looking at the options:

Option B: P=F, R=T, Q=F → Doesn't match.

Option C: P=T, R=T, Q=F → No, Q is F, but in Row 1 Q is T.

Option D: P=F, Q=T, R=F → No.

Option E: P=F, Q=F, R=F → No.

Option F: R=T, Q=T, P=F → No, in Row 1 P=T.

Option G: P=T, Q=T, R=F → Then Q·R would be F, so premise 2 is F, not a counterexample.

Option H: P=T, R=T, Q=T → That's Row 1. So H says "Invalid. Counterexample when P, R, and Q are all true." So that's exactly Row 1.

Wait, option H says "P, R, and Q are all true." So that's our counterexample.

But let me check the options again:

Options:

A: Valid

B: Invalid. Counterexample when P is false, R is true and Q is false

C: Invalid. Counterexample when P and R are true and Q is false

D: Invalid. Counterexample when P is false, Q is true and R is false

E: Invalid. Counterexample when P, Q, and R are all false

F: Invalid. Counterexample when R and Q are true and P is false

G: Invalid. Counterexample when P and Q are true and R is false

H: Invalid. Counterexample when P, R, and Q are all true

I: Invalid. Counterexample when P is true, R is false and Q is true

J: Valid. No possible counterexample

So the correct counterexample is when P, Q, R are all true, which is option H.

Wait, but in the initial analysis, I thought the counterexample was when P is T, Q is T, R is T. So that's option H.

But wait, let me double-check: in Row 1, both premises are true, and conclusion is F. So that's a counterexample.

Looking at the options, H is the correct one.

Wait, but I thought the correct answer was H, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake.

Wait, another way: the conclusion is ~P · R. So when P is T, ~P is F, so conclusion is F regardless of R. But in Row 1, R is T, so the conclusion is F because ~P is F. So that's correct.

Therefore, the argument is invalid, and the counterexample is when P, Q, R are all true. So the answer should be H.

But wait, let me check the options again. Option H is exactly that: P, R, and Q are all true.

So the answer is H: Invalid. Counterexample when P, R, and Q are all true.
</think>

The argument is invalid because there exists a counterexample where P, Q, and R are all true. In this case, both premises are true, but the conclusion is false.
