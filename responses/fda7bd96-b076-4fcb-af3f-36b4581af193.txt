Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the acceleration of an object at a specific time, given its position equation. Let's see what I remember.

The position is given by x = 2.0t³ + 4.0t + 6.25. Hmm, right. I remember that in kinematics, the position-time equation can be used to find velocity and acceleration by taking derivatives. Oh right, the first derivative of position with respect to time gives velocity, and the second derivative gives acceleration.

So, the plan is to find the acceleration as a function of time, and then plug in t=1.50 seconds.

First, let's find the velocity. The velocity v is dx/dt. So, I'll differentiate x with respect to t.

The equation is x = 2.0t³ + 4.0t + 6.25.

Differentiating term by term:

- The derivative of 2.0t³ is 3*2.0t² = 6.0t².
- The derivative of 4.0t is 4.0, since the derivative of t is 1.
- The derivative of 6.25, a constant, is 0.

So, velocity v = 6.0t² + 4.0 m/s.

Wait, that's the velocity function. Now, to find acceleration, I need the derivative of velocity with respect to time, which is the second derivative of position.

So, let's differentiate v again. The acceleration a = dv/dt.

v = 6.0t² + 4.0.

The derivative of 6.0t² is 2*6.0t = 12.0t.

The derivative of 4.0 is zero.

So, a(t) = 12.0t m/s².

Now, we need to find the acceleration at t = 1.50 seconds.

Plugging t=1.5 into a(t):

a = 12.0 * 1.5.

Let me calculate that. 12 * 1 is 12, and 12 * 0.5 is 6. So, 12 + 6 = 18.

So, a = 18 m/s².

Looking at the options, J is 18 m/s². So the correct answer should be J.

Wait, did I do everything right? Let me double-check. The position equation is correct, derivatives for velocity and acceleration seem right. The calculation for 12 * 1.5 is definitely 18. So yeah, I think I'm confident that J is the right choice.

The acceleration is found by taking the second derivative of the position function and evaluating it at t=1.50 s. The second derivative yields a(t) = 12.0t, and substituting t=1.50 s gives a=18 m/s².

Answer: J
