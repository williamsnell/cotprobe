Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about heat conduction through a window pane. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, I remember that heat conduction is usually calculated using Fourier's Law. The formula is something like Q/t = (k * A * ΔT) / d, right? Where Q/t is the rate of heat transfer, k is the thermal conductivity, A is the area, ΔT is the temperature difference, and d is the thickness of the material.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me make sure. Oh right, Fourier's Law is Q/t = (k * A * ΔT) / d. Yeah, that's correct. So I need to find the rate of heat conduction, which is Q/t.

The problem says the temperatures on either side are 70°F and 0°F. So the temperature difference ΔT is 70°F - 0°F = 70°F. But wait, wait. I think the formula uses temperature in Celsius because thermal conductivity (k) is usually given in units related to Celsius. Oh, but wait, actually, the formula works with any temperature difference as long as it's consistent. So 70°F difference is fine, but I need to make sure all units are correct.

Wait, no, wait. Thermal conductivity is often given in W/(m·K) or sometimes in other units. Oh, but the problem might not give me k, so maybe I'm supposed to know the thermal conductivity of glass. Wait, the problem doesn't provide k, so I must be missing something. Oh wait, perhaps the standard thermal conductivity for glass is assumed, like around 0.8 W/(m·K). Or maybe it's given elsewhere. Wait, the question doesn't provide it, so perhaps I'm supposed to know it.

Wait, wait, another thought: the formula uses ΔT in Kelvin or Celsius, but since it's a difference, it's the same in both. So 70°F difference is 70°F, which converts to Celsius as ΔT. Wait, wait, no, because 70°F is 21.11°C, but the difference in Fahrenheit is 70°F, which in Celsius is (70 - 32) * 5/9 = about 21.11°C. So the temperature difference ΔT is 70°F, which is equivalent to 21.11°C.

Wait, but in the formula, does ΔT need to be in Celsius? Because thermal conductivity k is usually given in W/(m·K) or cal/(s·cm·°C). Oh wait, I think I'm getting confused with units here. Let me clarify.

The formula for heat conduction can be written in different units depending on the context. If I use k in cal/(s·cm·°C), then area in cm², thickness in cm, and ΔT in °C, then the units would work out for Q/t in cal/s.

So let me get all the units right.

The area A is given as 2500 cm². The thickness d is 2 mm, which is 0.2 cm. The temperature difference ΔT is 70°F. But wait, because we're dealing with conduction, the actual temperature difference in °C is (70°F - 0°F) = 70°F. To convert that to Celsius, ΔT = (70 - 32) * 5/9 ≈ 21.11°C. So ΔT is 21.11°C.

Now, I need the thermal conductivity k for glass. I think glass typically has a k around 0.8 cal/(s·cm·°C) but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, let me think. I remember that glass is a poor conductor, so k is low. For example, glass might have k ≈ 0.004 cal/(s·cm·°C) or something like that. Wait, no, that seems too low. Let me check my notes: Oh, wait, glass's thermal conductivity is about 0.8 W/m·K, which is 0.8 J/(s·m·K). Let me convert that to cal/(s·cm·°C) because the other units are in cm and °C.

Wait, 1 W = 0.239 cal/s. So 0.8 W/(m·K) is 0.8 * 0.239 cal/(s·m·K). But I need to convert meters to centimeters. 1 m = 100 cm, so m is 100 cm. So 0.8 * 0.239 = approximately 0.1912 cal/(s·m·K). Then, since 1 m = 100 cm, divide by 100 to get per cm: 0.1912 / 100 = 0.001912 cal/(s·cm·K). But wait, since K and °C have the same magnitude for differences, I can use that as 0.001912 cal/(s·cm·°C).

Wait, but that seems really low. Let me double-check. Alternatively, I've heard that glass has a thermal conductivity around 0.8 W/m·K, which is about 0.8 * 0.239 = 0.191 cal/(s·m·°C). To convert to cm, divide by 100: 0.191 / 100 = 0.00191 cal/(s·cm·°C). Hmm, that's what I got earlier.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the thermal conductivity of glass is 0.004 cal/(s·cm·°C). Wait, I'm getting confused because different sources might have different values. Maybe I should confirm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use a standard value. Let's proceed with 0.004 cal/(s·cm·°C) for glass. Wait, I'm not certain, but let's go with that for now.

So, let's plug the numbers into the formula:

Q/t = (k * A * ΔT) / d

Given:
k = 0.004 cal/(s·cm·°C)
A = 2500 cm²
ΔT = 21.11°C
d = 0.2 cm

So, plugging in:

Q/t = (0.004 * 2500 * 21.11) / 0.2

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, 0.004 * 2500 = 10.

Then, 10 * 21.11 = 211.1.

Then, divide by 0.2: 211.1 / 0.2 = 1055.5 cal/s.

Wait, that's approximately 1055 cal/s. But looking at the options, the highest is F: 1000 cal/s. Hmm, but maybe I made a mistake in the value of k. Let me try with k = 0.8 cal/(s·cm·°C) instead. Wait, that would be a much higher value.

Wait, 0.8 cal/(s·cm·°C) would be more reasonable? Let me try that.

So, Q/t = (0.8 * 2500 * 21.11) / 0.2

Compute:

0.8 * 2500 = 2000.

2000 * 21.11 = 42,220.

42,220 / 0.2 = 211,100 cal/s. That's way too high, so that can't be right.

Hmm, so maybe my initial k was correct, but the result is 1055 cal/s, which isn't one of the options. The options are A:729, B:400, C:850, D:500, E:650, F:1000, G:300, H:900, I:600, J:475.

So 1055 is close to F:1000. But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of k. Let me double-check. Another approach: perhaps I should use the thermal conductivity in the correct units without confusion.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is (k * A * ΔT) / d, where the units are in SI units. Let me try that approach.

Wait, but the area is given in cm², so converting to m². 2500 cm² = 2500 * (0.01 m)^2 = 2500 * 0.0001 = 0.25 m².

Thickness d is 2 mm = 0.002 m.

ΔT is 70°F, which is 21.11°C, as before.

Thermal conductivity k for glass is approximately 0.8 W/(m·K).

So, using the formula Q/t = (k * A * ΔT) / d.

Plugging in:

Q/t = (0.8 * 0.25 m² * 21.11 K) / 0.002 m.

Compute numerator: 0.8 * 0.25 = 0.2. 0.2 * 21.11 ≈ 4.222.

Divide by 0.002: 4.222 / 0.002 = 2111 W.

Convert watts to calories per second: 1 W = 0.239 cal/s. So 2111 W * 0.239 ≈ 505 cal/s.

Hmm, that's approximately 505 cal/s. Looking at the options, D is 500 cal/s, which is close. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but earlier when I used k=0.004 cal/(s·cm·°C), I got around 1055 cal/s, but using the SI units approach with k=0.8 W/(m·K), I get 505 cal/s, which is option D. But why the discrepancy?

Ah, I think I see the mistake. When I converted k from W/(m·K) to cal/(s·cm·°C), I may have messed up the unit conversion.

Let me do that conversion properly.

1 W = 1 J/s. 1 J = 0.239 cal. So 1 W = 0.239 cal/s.

So, 0.8 W/(m·K) = 0.8 * 0.239 cal/(s·m·K).

Now, converting meters to centimeters: 1 m = 100 cm. So 1 m = 100 cm, so 1/(m) = 1/(100 cm) = 0.01/cm.

Thus, 0.8 W/(m·K) = 0.8 * 0.239 cal/(s·m·K) = 0.1912 cal/(s·m·K).

Convert m to cm: 1 m = 100 cm, so 1/(m) = 1/(100 cm) = 0.01/cm. So:

0.1912 cal/(s·m·K) = 0.1912 * 100 cal/(s·cm·K) = 19.12 cal/(s·cm·K).

Since K and °C have the same magnitude for temperature differences, this is 19.12 cal/(s·cm·°C).

Wait, that's way higher than the 0.004 I used earlier. So that's where I went wrong earlier.

So with k = 19.12 cal/(s·cm·°C), let's recalculate.

Q/t = (k * A * ΔT) / d

k = 19.12 cal/(s·cm·°C)
A = 2500 cm²
ΔT = 21.11°C
d = 0.2 cm

So,

Q/t = (19.12 * 2500 * 21.11) / 0.2

Let me compute that:

19.12 * 2500 = 47,800.

47,800 * 21.11 ≈ Let's compute 47,800 * 20 = 956,000 and 47,800 * 1.11 ≈ 53,038. So total ≈ 956,000 + 53,038 = 1,009,038.

Then, 1,009,038 / 0.2 = 5,045,190 cal/s. That's way too high, which can't be right. So clearly, I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, that can't be correct. Using SI units, I got around 505 cal/s, which makes sense. So perhaps I messed up the unit conversion earlier when using the cal/(s·cm·°C) unit.

Let me try to correct this. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to stick with the SI units approach.

So, using the SI units method, I got about 505 cal/s, which is option D:500 cal/s.

But let me make sure I did the SI units correctly.

k = 0.8 W/(m·K)
A = 0.25 m²
ΔT = 21.11 K
d = 0.002 m

Q/t = (0.8 * 0.25 * 21.11) / 0.002

Compute numerator: 0.8 * 0.25 = 0.2. 0.2 * 21.11 ≈ 4.222.

Divide by 0.002: 4.222 / 0.002 = 2111 W.

Convert to cal/s: 2111 W * 0.239 cal/s per W ≈ 2111 * 0.239 ≈ 505 cal/s.

So that's correct. So the answer should be around 505 cal/s, which is closest to option D:500 cal/s.

But wait, let me check the options again. Option D is 500, and option F is 1000, which is higher. But according to the calculation, it's 505, so D is the best fit.

To determine the rate of heat conduction through the window pane, we use Fourier's Law:

\[
\frac{Q}{t} = \frac{k \cdot A \cdot \Delta T}{d}
\]

### Given Data:
- **Area (A)**: \(2500 \, \text{cm}^2 = 0.25 \, \text{m}^2\)
- **Thickness (d)**: \(2 \, \text{mm} = 0.002 \, \text{m}\)
- **Temperature difference (\(\Delta T\))**: \(70^\circ \text{F} - 0^\circ \text{F} = 21.11^\circ \text{C}\) (converted from \(70^\circ \text{F}\))
- **Thermal Conductivity (k)**: For glass, \(k = 0.8 \, \text{W/m·K}\)

### Calculation:
1. **Numerator**:  
   \[
   k \cdot A \cdot \Delta T = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 \cdot 21.11 = 4.222 \, \text{W}
   \]

2. **Denominator**:  
   \[
   d = 0.002 \, \text{m}
   \]

3. **Power in Watts**:  
   \[
   \frac{Q}{t} = \frac{4.222}{0.002} = 2111 \, \text{W}
   \]

4. **Convert to Calories per Second**:  
   Using \(1 \, \text{W} = 0.239 \, \text{cal/s}\):  
   \[
   \frac{Q}{t} = 2111 \cdot 0.239 \approx 505 \, \text{cal/s}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The calculated rate of heat conduction is approximately \(505 \, \text{cal/s}\), which aligns closely with option **D: 500 cal/s**.
