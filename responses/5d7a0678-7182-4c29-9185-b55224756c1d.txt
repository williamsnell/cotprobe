Question:

Rainmaking Lawfirm regularly purchased its office supplies from catalogs. Marty Manager saw an advertising catalog from Costco offering 10,000 envelopes for $1,000 CIF. He immediately sent a purchase order which stated "our law firm accepts your $1,000 offer for 10,000 envelopes for $1,000 CIF."¬ù Costco then sent Rainmaking an order confirmation which stated "Envelope order acceptance conditional upon a loading charge of $50 per thousand envelopes." If the parties disagree on the proper contract relationship, a court would likely rule:

Options:

A: A contract at $1,000 because the offer terms CIF means cost, insurance and freight including all loading charges.
B: A contract at $1,500 because the loading charges are to be included.
C: No contract because the order confirmation was a counteroffer which was not accepted.
D: No contract because the purchase order was the offer and, under the mirror image rule, can not be deviated from.

Okay, so I need to figure out the correct answer to this contracts question. Let me start by breaking down the scenario.

Rainmaking Lawfirm received an advertising catalog from Costco offering 10,000 envelopes for $1,000 CIF. Marty Manager sent a purchase order accepting that offer. Then Costco sent an order confirmation saying acceptance is conditional on a $50 loading charge per thousand envelopes.

Hmm, I remember that in contract law, an offer and acceptance must meet certain criteria. The mirror image rule says that the terms of the acceptance must exactly match the offer; any additional terms might make it a counteroffer rather than an acceptance.

So here, Costco's catalog was the original offer. Marty's purchase order accepted that offer. But then Costco sent a confirmation adding a loading charge. That seems like a modification of the terms. Under the UCC, if the original offer was an advertisement or catalog, it's usually an invitation for offers, not a binding offer. But Marty accepted it, so the contract should form based on his acceptance unless there's a problem.

Wait, but when Costco sent the confirmation with the loading charge, that might be a counteroffer. If Marty didn't accept those new terms, then there's no contract. Because under the mirror image rule, if the acceptance doesn't match, it's not a valid acceptance. So the purchase order was the offer, and the confirmation added terms, which would be a counteroffer. Since Marty didn't accept those, there's no contract.

Looking at the options:

A says the contract is at $1,000 because CIF includes everything. But I think loading charges might not be included in CIF, depending on the interpretation. Or maybe in this case, the additional charge makes it a different term.

B says $1,500 because loading is included. But if the original offer didn't include that, and the acceptance didn't agree, this might not apply.

C says no contract because the confirmation was a counteroffer not accepted. That aligns with what I was thinking.

D says no contract because of the mirror image rule. So the purchase order was the offer, and the confirmation added terms, so it's a counteroffer. So D might be correct too.

Wait, the mirror image rule is about whether the acceptance matches the offer. If the acceptance doesn't mirror, then it's not acceptance. So Marty's purchase order was an acceptance, but then Costco tried to add terms, which would mean no contract because the terms weren't mirrored.

So the options are C and D. The difference is whether the purchase order is the offer or the confirmation is. Wait, no, in this scenario, the catalog was the offer, Marty's purchase order was the acceptance. So the mirror image rule applies when the acceptance is made; if it doesn't mirror, it's a rejection plus a counteroffer.

So if Marty's purchase order was an acceptance, and then Costco sent a confirmation adding terms, that would be a counteroffer. So unless Marty accepted those terms, there's no contract.

So option C says no contract because the order confirmation was a counteroffer not accepted. That seems correct.

Alternatively, option D says no contract because the purchase order was the offer and can't be deviated from. Wait, no, the purchase order was the acceptance of Costco's offer. So if the acceptance didn't match, then it's a counteroffer. So D might be incorrect because the mirror image rule applies to the acceptance, not the offer.

So the correct answer would be C: No contract because the order confirmation was a counteroffer which was not accepted.

The scenario involves Rainmaking Lawfirm accepting an offer from Costco via a purchase order, but Costco later adds a loading charge in its confirmation. Under the mirror image rule, acceptance must match the offer exactly. Marty's purchase order accepted Costco's offer, but Costco's confirmation added new terms, effectively making it a counteroffer. Since Marty did not accept these new terms, there is no valid contract. 

Answer: C
