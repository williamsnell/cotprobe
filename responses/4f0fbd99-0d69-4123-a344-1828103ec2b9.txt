Question:

A species of small rodent eats seeds from only one species of pine. In normal years, a pair of these rodents will have a litter of two or three. It is unusual for small rodents to have such small litter sizes. The rodents are most likely to exhibit which other characteristic?

Options:

A: Precocial young
B: Nocturnal behavior
C: Herbivorous diet
D: High birth rate
E: Solitary behavior
F: High parental investment
G: Large body size
H: Frequent extrapair matings
I: Moderate sexual size dimorphism
J: Low survival rate

Answer:

Okay, so I have this biology question here about a species of small rodent that eats seeds from only one species of pine. The question says that in normal years, a pair of these rodents has a litter of two or three, which is unusual because small rodents typically have larger litters. I need to figure out which other characteristic they're most likely to exhibit from the given options.

Let me start by breaking down what I know. Small rodents, like mice or voles, usually have traits that help them maximize their reproductive success. Larger litters are common because it increases the chance that more offspring survive to reproduce. But in this case, their litters are small, which is not typical. So, why would they have small litters?

Well, maybe it's because their main food source is limited. They eat seeds from just one species of pine, so when the pine cones are abundant, they can have more offspring, but perhaps in their environment, resources are scarce. But the question says it's normal years, so the litters are still small. Hmm.

If their litters are small, maybe they invest more in each offspring. I remember that animals with small litters often have higher parental investment because they can't have many offspring, so they need to ensure each one has a better chance of survival. So this might relate to option F, high parental investment.

Looking at the options:

A: Precocial young – These are young that are relatively mature at birth, like birds. But small rodents usually have altricial young, which are underdeveloped. So A might not be it.

B: Nocturnal behavior – Some rodents are nocturnal, but I don't see a direct link here. Maybe, but not sure.

C: Herbivorous diet – Well, they eat seeds, which are plant-based, so they're herbivores. But the question already states that, so C might not be the answer they're looking for.

D: High birth rate – If they have small litters, maybe their overall reproductive rate isn't high. High birth rate would imply many litters, but the question says litters are small in normal years.

E: Solitary behavior – Some rodents are solitary, but I'm not sure how that ties into litter size. Maybe, but not the first thing that comes to mind.

F: High parental investment – This seems plausible. If they have small litters, the parents might invest more in each offspring, like providing more care, food, etc.

G: Large body size – Small rodents usually have smaller body sizes, so G doesn't seem right.

H: Frequent extrapair matings – Not sure how this relates. Maybe in some species, but not a direct link to litter size.

I: Moderate sexual size dimorphism – Maybe, but again, not directly tied to litter size.

J: Low survival rate – If they have small litters, perhaps each has a better chance, meaning maybe higher survival per offspring, but the overall survival rate could be low if the environment is harsh. Not sure.

So, thinking about it, if they have small litters, the parents probably spend more time and resources on each offspring. High parental investment makes sense because they can't rely on having many offspring; instead, they focus on ensuring each one survives. So I think the answer is F.

The small rodent in question has an unusual trait of small litter sizes, which suggests that they may compensate by investing more resources into each offspring. High parental investment (Option F) aligns with this, as they likely provide more care to ensure the survival of their young despite fewer offspring. 

Answer: F
