Question:

Explain the TRAILER CARD method of stopping a computer job, i.e., a program.

Options:

A: The Trailer Card method uses a serial number on the first card to stop a program.
B: The Trailer Card method uses a specific phrase typed into the console to signal the end of a job.
C: The Trailer Card method requires a specific card to be inserted physically into the computer.
D: The Trailer Card method involves sending an electronic signal through a network to stop the program.
E: The Trailer Card method employs a magnetic tape marker to indicate the end of a program.
F: The Trailer Card method uses a unique number on the last card in the data section of a program card deck to signal the end of a job.
G: The Trailer Card method utilizes a timer that automatically stops the program after a set duration.
H: The Trailer Card method involves pressing a designated key on the computer's keyboard to terminate the job.
I: The Trailer Card method requires the operator to manually switch off the computer to end the job.
J: The Trailer Card method uses a special code to pause a program.

Okay, I need to figure out the correct answer to this question about the TRAILER CARD method of stopping a computer job. Let me start by understanding what the TRAILER CARD method is. From what I remember, it's related to how early computers handled the end of a program, especially those that used punch cards for input.

So, the question is asking to explain how the TRAILER CARD method works. The options are A through J, each describing a different method. I should go through each option one by one to see which makes sense.

Option A says it uses a serial number on the first card. Hmm, I don't think that's right. I recall that the trailer card was about signaling the end, not the beginning, so the first card probably isn't the key here.

Option B mentions a specific phrase typed into the console. That sounds more like an input command, maybe like a Ctrl+D or something, but I'm not sure if that's the trailer card method.

Option C requires inserting a specific card physically into the computer. Wait, that rings a bell. I think early computers used a special card at the end of the deck to signal the end of the job. So the operator would place this card, and the computer knew to stop.

Option D talks about an electronic signal through a network. That doesn't sound right because networks weren't really a thing when punch cards were the norm. Plus, it's more of a modern method.

Option E uses a magnetic tape marker. I'm not sure about that. Magnetic tapes were used for data storage, but the trailer card method was about cards, so probably not E.

Option F says a unique number on the last card in the data section. That seems plausible. I think the last card had a specific identifier, maybe a number, to indicate the end.

Option G uses a timer. I don't think the trailer card was about timing; it was about physical indication.

Option H is pressing a designated key. That sounds more like using a keyboard command to stop, which might be a different method.

Option I requires manually switching off the computer. That's more like shutting down the system, not stopping a specific job.

Option J uses a special code to pause. Pausing is different from stopping the job entirely, so maybe not.

Now, thinking back, the trailer card was a physical card placed at the end of the deck. The computer would process until it reached this card, then stop. So between C and F, which one is correct. Option C says inserting a specific card physically, while F talks about a unique number on the last data card.

Wait, maybe the trailer card was a specific type of card, not just any card with a number. So perhaps the card itself was unique in form, like a control card, which the computer recognized. So option C might be more accurate because it's about inserting a specific card, whereas F is about the content of the last card.

Alternatively, F could be correct if the last card in the data deck had a unique number, signaling the end. I'm a bit confused now. Let me think: in early computing, when using punch cards, the deck would have the program and data cards. At the end, a special card, sometimes called a 'trailer' card, was added. This card might have a specific code or be formatted in a way that the computer knew it was the end. So it's about the presence of this card, not necessarily a number on it.

So, option C says it requires inserting a specific card physically. That makes sense because the operator would place that card in the deck, and the computer stops when it encounters it. Option F is about a number on the last card, which might be part of the data, but the trailer card was more about a control card that indicated the end, not just a data card with a number.

Therefore, the correct answer should be C.
