Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this biology question about sea urchin oocytes and calcium levels. Let me break it down step by step.

The question says that a rise in intracellular free calcium in the sea urchin oocyte leads to the release of proteolytic enzymes. These enzymes prevent polyspermy. I need to figure out which reaction or process this entails from the given options.

First, I should recall what each of these terms means. Polyspermy is when multiple sperm fertilize an egg, which usually isn't good because it can lead to abnormal embryos. So, the oocyte must have a mechanism to prevent that.

Proteolytic enzymes are enzymes that break down proteins. In the context of fertilization, when an egg is fertilized, something happens to prevent other sperm from entering. I remember that the acrosome in sperm releases enzymes to help penetrate the zona pellucida, the outer layer of the egg. But once the first sperm gets in, the egg needs to block others.

Wait, there's something called the cortical reaction. I think that's when the oocyte releases enzymes that change the zona pellucida, making it harder for other sperm to get in. So, the rise in calcium triggers this response.

The question mentions the release of proteolytic enzymes. Oh, right, in the cortical reaction, these enzymes are released. They might digest the zona pellucida or create a barrier. So the events described are part of the cortical reaction.

Looking at the options:

A: polyspermy reaction – that's the problem, not the solution.
B: enzymatic reaction – too vague, any enzyme activity.
C: proteolytic reaction – that's the type of enzyme, but is it the reaction name?
D: acrosomal reaction – that's the sperm's response, not the oocyte's.
E: oocyte reaction – possible, but not specific.
F: fertilization reaction – too broad.
G: calcium reaction – just a term, not specific enough.
H: cortical reaction – this fits because it's the oocyte's response to prevent polyspermy.
I: zona reaction – maybe related, but I think it's part of the cortical reaction.
J: intracellular reaction – not specific.

So the correct answer should be H: cortical reaction.

The events described involve a rise in intracellular calcium in the oocyte, leading to the release of proteolytic enzymes that prevent polyspermy. This process is known as the cortical reaction, which specifically refers to the oocyte's response to prevent multiple sperm from fertilizing the egg by modifying the zona pellucida.

Answer: H
