Question:

Clare manages a piano store. Her utility function is given by Utility = w - 100, where w is the total of all monetary payments to her and 100 represents the monetary equivalent of the disutility of exerting effort to run the store. Her next best alternative to managing the store gives her zero utility. The store's revenue depends on random factors, with an equal chance of being $1,000 or $400. If shareholders offered to share half of the store's revenue with her, what would her expected utility be?

Options:

A: 300
B: 225
C: 100
D: 450
E: 350
F: 250
G: 150
H: 200
I: 500
J: 400

Okay, so I've got this economics problem here, and I'm a bit new to utility functions, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

Clare manages a piano store, and her utility function is given by Utility = w - 100, where w is the total of all monetary payments to her. The 100 represents the disutility from exerting effort to run the store. Her next best alternative gives her zero utility. The store's revenue is either $1,000 or $400, each with an equal chance. Shareholders are offering to share half of the store's revenue with her. I need to find her expected utility.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. First, I think I should figure out what her monetary payment (w) would be under the shareholders' offer. Since they're sharing half of the revenue, that means Clare gets half of whatever the store makes. But wait, the store's revenue is randomâ€”it can be $1,000 or $400, each with a 50% chance.

So, I need to calculate the expected revenue first. Expected revenue is the average of the two possible revenues, weighted by their probabilities. Since each outcome is equally likely, the expected revenue (E[w]) would be (1000 + 400)/2 = 700. So, E[w] = $700.

But wait, no, wait. Because she gets half of the revenue. So her expected payment would be half of the expected revenue. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should compute her payment for each scenario and then average them.

If revenue is $1,000, she gets 1,000 / 2 = $500. If revenue is $400, she gets 400 / 2 = $200. So, her payments in the two scenarios are $500 and $200. The expected payment (E[w]) would be (500 + 200)/2 = $350.

Wait, that's different from the other approach. Oh right, because when dealing with expected values, especially when the payment is a function of the revenue, it's better to compute the expected payment based on each possible outcome. So yes, her expected payment is $350.

Now, her utility function is w - 100. So her expected utility would be her expected payment minus 100. So that would be 350 - 100 = 250.

Wait, but let me double-check. The utility function is Utility = w - 100, where w is the total payments. So her expected utility is E[Utility] = E[w] - 100. Since E[w] is $350, then E[U] = 350 - 100 = 250.

Looking at the options, F is 250. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but did I make a mistake? Let me go through it again. The revenue is either 1000 or 400, each with 50% chance. She gets half of that, so 500 or 200. The average of 500 and 200 is (500 + 200)/2 = 350. So her expected payment is 350. Then subtract 100 for the disutility of effort, giving 250. So yes, F is correct.

Clare's expected payment is calculated by averaging her share of the revenue, which is half of either $1,000 or $400. This gives her expected payment as $350. Subtracting the disutility of effort (100) results in an expected utility of 250.

Answer: F
