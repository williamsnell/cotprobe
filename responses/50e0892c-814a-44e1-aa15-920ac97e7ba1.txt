Okay, so I've got this problem where someone is walking in different directions, and I need to figure out how far they are from their starting point. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the person walks 3 miles east. Then they turn north and walk 10 miles. After that, they turn west and walk 6 miles, and finally, they turn south and walk 16 miles. I think I should represent this on a coordinate system to visualize it better.

Let me imagine a coordinate grid where east is the positive x-direction, north is the positive y-direction, west is negative x, and south is negative y. Starting point is (0,0).

1. Walk 3 miles east: that would take them to (3, 0).
2. Then turn north and walk 10 miles: from (3,0), moving north (y increases) to (3,10).
3. Turn west and walk 6 miles: from (3,10), moving west (x decreases) to (3-6, 10) which is (-3,10).
4. Finally, turn south and walk 16 miles: from (-3,10), moving south (y decreases) to (-3,10-16) which is (-3,-6).

So the final position is (-3, -6). Now, to find the distance from the starting point (0,0), I can use the distance formula. The distance is sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2]. Plugging in the values:

Distance = sqrt[(-3 - 0)^2 + (-6 - 0)^2] = sqrt[9 + 36] = sqrt[45]. 

Wait, sqrt(45) is the same as 3*sqrt(5), which is approximately 6.708 miles. Looking at the options, option G is 6.7, which matches this calculation. But wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, when I walked west after going north, I went from (3,10) west 6 miles, so 3-6 is -3, that's correct. Then south 16 from y=10 would be 10-16=-6, correct. So final position is (-3,-6). The distance from (0,0) would be sqrt(3^2 + 6^2) = sqrt(9+36)=sqrt(45)=6.708, so yes, option G is 6.7. But wait, looking at the options, option G is 6.7, but I'm not sure if I've considered all the movements correctly.

Wait, maybe I should recheck each step again. Let me go through each movement again:

- Start at (0,0). East 3: (3,0).
- North 10: (3,10).
- West 6: (3-6,10) = (-3,10).
- South 16: (-3,10-16) = (-3,-6).

Yes, that's correct. So the displacement in x is -3 (west 3) and in y is -6 (south 6). So the distance is sqrt(3^2 + 6^2) = sqrt(9+36)=sqrt(45)= about 6.708. So the closest option is G:6.7.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see options like 5.5, 13.9, etc. Hmm, did I make a mistake in calculating the net movement? Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the net movement in each direction. Let's see:

East and West movements: 3 east and 6 west. Since west is negative, net east-west movement is 3 -6 = -3 (which is 3 miles west).

North and South movements: 10 north and 16 south. Net is 10 -16 = -6 (6 miles south).

So yes, same as before. So the displacement is 3 west and 6 south, which is the same as (-3,-6). So the distance is sqrt(3^2 +6^2)=sqrt(45)= approx 6.708, so G is correct.

Wait, but I just noticed that in the problem statement, after walking east 3, then north 10, west 6, then south 16. Let me make sure I didn't mix up any steps. Wait, from (3,10) west 6 is correct, ending at (-3,10). Then south 16 would take y from 10 to -6, correct. So yes, the final position is (-3,-6). So the distance is sqrt(45)=6.708, which rounds to 6.7. So the answer should be G:6.7.

The person ends up at (-3, -6) after their movements. Using the distance formula, the distance from the starting point is √(3² + 6²) ≈ 6.7 miles.

Answer: G
