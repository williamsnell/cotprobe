Question:

What is cognitive dissonance as explained byFestinger?

Options:

A: Cognitive dissonance is a learning theory that describes the process by which people adapt their behavior to match their intentions
B: Cognitive dissonance is a condition where an individual experiences difficulty in decision-making due to the presence of too many choices
C: Cognitive dissonance is a motivational theory that suggests individuals are driven to change their attitudes when they experience positive reinforcement
D: Cognitive dissonance is a theory about memory retention
E: Cognitive dissonance is a state of mind where an individual is completely aware and accepting of their conflicting attitudes
F: Cognitive dissonance is a theory about emotional stability
G: Cognitive dissonance is a psychological phenomenon where an individual's beliefs are in harmony with their actions at all times
H: Cognitive dissonance is a theory about personality traits
I: Cognitive dissonance is a theory that states that cognitions can have one of three relations to one another - consonant, irrelevant, or dissonant. Dissonant cognitions result in contradictory behaviors, and the experience of dissonance is a negative motivational state that aims at reducing the dissonance.
J: Cognitive dissonance is a social theory that explains the dynamics of group decision-making

Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, I need to figure out which option correctly defines cognitive dissonance as explained by Festinger. Let me start by recalling what I know about cognitive dissonance. I remember that Festinger was a psychologist who developed this theory. From what I've studied, cognitive dissonance refers to the mental discomfort or tension that arises when a person holds two or more contradictory beliefs, values, or ideas at the same time. This discomfort motivates the person to reduce the dissonance, either by changing their beliefs, adding new cognitions, or rationalizing the existing ones.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A says it's a learning theory about adapting behavior to match intentions. That doesn't sound right. Cognitive dissonance is more about internal conflict and motivation to reduce it, not just learning behaviors.

Option B talks about difficulty in decision-making due to too many choices. That's more related to decision paralysis or maybe the paradox of choice, which is a different concept.

Option C mentions motivational theory with positive reinforcement. While cognitive dissonance does have motivational aspects, it's not specifically about positive reinforcement, which is more of a behaviorist concept.

Option D is about memory retention. No, that's not it. Memory retention is about remembering information, not about conflicting cognitions.

Option E says it's a state of mind with full awareness and acceptance of conflicting attitudes. I think Festinger's theory is about the discomfort from conflicting thoughts, not necessarily being fully aware and accepting. People usually try to reduce dissonance, not accept it.

Option F refers to emotional stability. That doesn't fit because cognitive dissonance is about mental conflict leading to motivation to change, not about stability.

Option G claims beliefs are in harmony with actions always. That's the opposite of cognitive dissonance, which is about when they aren't in harmony.

Option H is about personality traits. No, cognitive dissonance is a psychological phenomenon, not a trait.

Option I states that cognitions can have consonant, irrelevant, or dissonant relations. Dissonant ones cause contradictory behavior and negative motivation to reduce it. That aligns with what I remember. Festinger's theory does talk about the relations between cognitions and the drive to reduce dissonance.

Option J is a social theory about group decision-making. That's more about group dynamics, not the individual's internal conflict.

So, the correct answer should be I.

The correct answer is I, as it accurately describes cognitive dissonance as a theory where cognitions can be consonant, irrelevant, or dissonant, and dissonance leads to a negative motivational state aimed at reducing the conflict.

Answer: I
