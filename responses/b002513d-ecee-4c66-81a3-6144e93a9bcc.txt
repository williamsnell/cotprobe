Okay, so I have this question about statistics, and I need to figure out the smallest number of standard deviations from the mean that I must go to ensure at least 50% of the data is included. Hmm, I remember something about the empirical rule, but wait, that's for normal distributions, right? The question doesn't specify the type of distribution, though. Oh wait, maybe it's assuming a normal distribution because it's talking about standard deviations.

The empirical rule says that for a normal distribution, about 68% of the data is within one standard deviation, 95% within two, and 99.7% within three. But that's for 68%, 95%, and 99.7%. The question is asking for at least 50%, which is less than 68%, so maybe I don't need to go as far as one standard deviation. Wait, but I'm not sure. I think there's another rule or maybe a theorem that gives a more general approach.

Oh right! There's Chebyshev's inequality. I remember it's used for any distribution, not just normal. Chebyshev's inequality states that the proportion of data within k standard deviations of the mean is at least 1 - 1/k². So if I want at least 50%, that means the proportion p is 0.5. So I can set up the inequality: 1 - 1/k² ≥ 0.5. Let me solve for k.

Subtracting 1 from both sides gives -1/k² ≥ -0.5. Multiplying both sides by -1 (and flipping the inequality) gives 1/k² ≤ 0.5. Taking reciprocals (since both sides are positive), we get k² ≥ 2. Taking square roots, k ≥ sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142. So k needs to be at least approximately 1.4142 standard deviations away from the mean to capture at least 50% of the data.

Looking at the options, J is 1.4, which is close to sqrt(2). So the smallest number would be 1.4, right? But wait, the empirical rule for the normal distribution says that about 68% is within 1 standard deviation, which is more than 50%. So if the data is normal, then 1 standard deviation would give me 68%, which is more than 50%. So maybe in that case, I don't need to go as far as 1.4. But the question is about the minimal k that works for any distribution, so I have to use Chebyshev's because it's more general.

Wait, but the question says "if we want to ensure that we have at least 50% of the data." So it's the minimal k that works for any possible distribution. So Chebyshev gives me that k must be at least sqrt(2) ≈1.414, so the answer would be 1.4, which is option J. But let me double-check. Another thought: in a normal distribution, the exact value for 50% is actually around 0.67 standard deviations because the z-score for 50% is about 0.67 (since the median is at 0 for a standard normal distribution). So if the distribution is normal, then 0.67 standard deviations would cover 50%. But the question is asking for the minimal k that works for any distribution. So using Chebyshev, I have to go with 1.414. But wait, looking at the options, G is 0.67, which is lower than 1.4. So why isn't that the answer? Because Chebyshev's gives a more conservative estimate, but if the distribution is normal, you can do better.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "the smallest number of standard deviations from the mean that we must go if we want to ensure that we have at least 50% of the data of a distribution." The key word is "ensure," which implies that it must work for any distribution. So using Chebyshev, the minimal k is about 1.414, so option J. But wait, I'm getting confused because in a normal distribution, you can get away with a smaller k. But since the question doesn't specify the distribution, we have to assume the worst case, which is Chebyshev's inequality.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the normal distribution. Because if it's normal, the 50th percentile is at z=0, but that's the mean. Wait no, because the mean is the center, so 50% on each side. Wait, no. The mean is the middle point, so to capture 50% of the data, you could just take the mean itself, but that's zero standard deviations. But that doesn't make sense because the question is asking for the number of standard deviations from the mean. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The question is about the range around the mean that includes at least 50% of the data. In a normal distribution, the mean is the center, so to get 50% on each side, you don't need to go far. Wait, no, because the normal distribution is symmetric, so the mean is the middle, so the 50th percentile is the mean itself. So to capture 50% of the data, you just need to include the mean, which is zero standard deviations. But that can't be right because the options don't include zero.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's clarify. The question is asking for the minimal k such that the interval [mean - kσ, mean + kσ] contains at least 50% of the data. For a normal distribution, the z-score for 50% is 0 because the mean is the median. But that's not helpful because that would mean zero standard deviations, which can't be right because that's just the mean. So perhaps the question is about the minimal k such that the interval captures 50% of the data, meaning the middle 50%, which would require going some distance from the mean.

Wait, in a normal distribution, the middle 50% is between the 25th and 75th percentiles. The z-scores for those are approximately ±0.6745. So k would be about 0.67, which is option G. But that's specific to the normal distribution. But the question doesn't specify the distribution, so if we have to ensure it for any distribution, we need to use Chebyshev's inequality. So in that case, the minimal k is sqrt(2) ≈1.414, which is option J.

But wait, the question is about the smallest number of standard deviations. So if we're using Chebyshev, that's the minimal k for any distribution. But if the distribution is normal, you can have a smaller k. But the question is about ensuring at least 50% regardless of the distribution, so we have to use Chebyshev's. Therefore, the answer should be J:1.4.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is phrased as "the smallest number of standard deviations from the mean that we must go." So it's the minimal k such that, no matter the distribution, at least 50% is within that range. So using Chebyshev's inequality, which gives the minimal k as sqrt(1/(1 - p)) where p is the proportion. Wait, no, Chebyshev's inequality is 1 - 1/k² ≥ p. So for p=0.5, 1 - 1/k² ≥0.5 → 1/k² ≤0.5 → k² ≥2 →k≥sqrt(2)=~1.414.

So the answer is J:1.4.
</think>

The question asks for the smallest number of standard deviations from the mean needed to ensure at least 50% of the data is included in any distribution. Using Chebyshev's inequality, which applies to any distribution, the inequality is:

\[
1 - \frac{1}{k^2} \geq 0.5
\]

Solving for \( k \), we find \( k \geq \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414 \). This ensures that at least 50% of the data lies within \( k \) standard deviations of the mean. Among the options provided, the closest value is **1.4**, corresponding to option J.
