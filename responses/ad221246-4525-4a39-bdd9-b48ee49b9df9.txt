Question:

A man died in 1985. His will devised his estate in a Midwestern state to his son and daughter "to share and share alike as tenants in common. "At the time of their father's death, the daughter lived in a different part of the Midwestern state (in which the estate was located) while the son resided in a state in the Southwest. After the funeral, the daughter returned to her own residence, but the son decided to occupy the estate. He put his name on the mailbox and has paid the taxes and maintenance expenses. The daughter has been generally aware of this, but because she cared little about the estate, the daughter has never pressed her brother about the property. Since 1985, the daughter has not paid any rent or other compensation to her brother, nor has he requested such payment. In January 2010, a series of disputes arose between the son and daughter for the first time concerning their respective rights to the estate. The state in which the property is located recognizes the usual common law types of cotenancies and there is no applicable legislation on the subject. Now, the son claims the entire fee simple absolute title to the estate and brings an action against his sister to quiet title in himself. If the Midwestern states in which the property is located has an ordinary 20-year adverse possession statute, judgment should be for whom?

Options:

A: The son, because he has paid the taxes and maintenance expenses since 1985.
B: The son, because the acts of the parties indicate the sister's intention to renounce her ownership rights to the estate.
C: The daughter, because there is no evidence that her brother has performed sufficient acts to constitute an ouster.
D: The daughter, because the brother did not take any legal action to claim the property until 2010.
E: Both, because they were given the estate "to share and share alike as tenants in common."
F: The son, because during the past 25 years, the son has exercised the type of occupancy ordinarily considered sufficient to satisfy adverse possession requirements.
G: The daughter, because the brother did not request any rent or other compensation for the past 25 years.
H: The son, because the daughter has not shown any interest in the property.
I: The daughter, because one cotenant cannot acquire title by adverse possession against another.
J: The son, because he has lived in the property for more than 20 years.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about property law, specifically dealing with cotenancy and adverse possession. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: A man died in 1985, and his will left his estate in a Midwestern state to his son and daughter as tenants in common. So, they each own an undivided share of the property. After the father's death, the son moved into the estate, put his name on the mailbox, paid the taxes and maintenance. The daughter knew about this but didn't do anything about it. She didn't pay any rent or ask for compensation, and there were no disputes until 2010 when they started arguing over their rights.

The question is whether the son can claim the entire fee simple absolute title through adverse possession, considering the state's 20-year adverse possession statute.

Alright, so I need to recall what tenants in common means. As tenants in common, each owns an undivided share, and each has the right to possess the entire property. However, one cotenant can't just take over the whole property unless there's a legal basis, like adverse possession.

Adverse possession typically requires that one cotenant takes possession of the property against the other's rights, with the intent to exclude the other. The key here is whether the son's actions since 1985 meet the statutory requirements for adverse possession in this state, which seems to have a 20-year period.

I remember that for adverse possession, the possessor must have taken exclusive, continuous, and hostile possession for the statutory period. Hostile doesn't necessarily mean aggressive; it just means without the owner's permission.

In this case, the son has been living there since 1985, which is over 25 years. The daughter was aware but didn't do anything. Now, the issue is whether the son's actions constitute adverse possession.

Wait, but the daughter didn't actively object. Does that affect the adversity? Adverse possession requires that the possessor's actions are against the interest of the other owner. If the daughter didn't challenge him, does that mean there's no adversity?

I think the key is whether the son's actions were hostile. If he took possession without the daughter's consent and treated the property as his own, that could count. But if the daughter didn't object, maybe it's not considered adverse. Alternatively, maybe the mere fact that he treated it as his own, without her permission, is enough.

Looking at the options, option F says the son has exercised occupancy sufficient for adverse possession. Option I says that cotenants can't acquire title by adverse possession against each other. Hmm, that's an important point. Because they are cotenants, does that mean they can't claim adverse possession against each other? Or does the law allow this?

I think in some jurisdictions, a cotenant can't claim against another cotenant through adverse possession because they're already co-owners. They can't adverse possess against each other because they have a pre-existing right. So, if they're tenants in common, one can't take the whole title by adverse possession because they're not claiming against a stranger but against a co-owner.

So, in that case, the son can't claim the entire title through adverse possession because they're co-owners, so the answer might be option I: the daughter because one cotenant cannot acquire title by adverse possession against another.

Wait, but the son has been in possession for over 20 years. If the statute requires 20 years, and he's met that, but the fact that they're co-owners might prevent him from using adverse possession. Because adverse possession is against someone else's ownership, but here they're both owners.

Alternatively, maybe the fact that he treated it as his own, without the sister's consent, and she didn't do anything, could lead to a different outcome. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: under the statute, does the period of possession count only when the possessor is acting against the interest of the other owner? If the daughter didn't object, maybe the possession wasn't adverse. Or, perhaps the fact that the son treated it as his own, without her permission, is enough.

Wait, I think the rule is that a cotenant can't acquire title by adverse possession from another cotenant because they are co-owners. So, the sister's inaction doesn't mean the brother can take her share. Therefore, the daughter still owns her share, so the son can't get the entire title through adverse possession.

Looking at the options, option I says exactly that: the daughter because one cotenant cannot acquire title by adverse possession against another. So, that would be the correct answer.

The question revolves around whether the son can claim the entire title through adverse possession against his sister, given that they are tenants in common. Adverse possession generally requires exclusive, continuous, and hostile possession for the statutory period. However, in this case, the son and daughter are co-owners, meaning the son cannot claim the property through adverse possession against his sister. Cotenants cannot acquire title by adverse possession against each other because they are already co-owners, and adverse possession typically applies to claims against strangers, not existing co-owners. Therefore, the daughter retains her ownership rights, and the son cannot claim the entire title.

Answer: I
