Question:

 What is the main reason why Arthur doesn't think that the poor have a right to aid from the affluent?

Options:

A: Arthur believes that the provision of aid undermines the principles of free-market capitalism.

C: The consequences of helping the poor would be worse than the consequences of not helping them.
D: The right to aid is a negative right.

F: Arthur believes that the affluent have earned their wealth and should not be obligated to share it.
G: Arthur believes that aid should only be given voluntarily, not out of obligation.
H: Arthur thinks that aid only perpetuates poverty and does not solve the root cause.
I: The poor are responsible for their own situation, according to Arthur.
J: Persons can never have a right to aid from anyone.

Okay, so I need to figure out the main reason why Arthur doesn't think the poor have a right to aid from the affluent. Let me start by recalling the question and the options provided.

The question is about Arthur's reasoning. I think Arthur is a philosopher, maybe from a libertarian perspective, given the options. The options are from A to J, each giving a different reason.

First, let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Arthur believes that aid undermines free-market capitalism. Well, free-market capitalism relies on individual initiative and private property. If he thinks aid undermines it, maybe because it involves redistribution, but I'm not sure if that's the main reason.

Option B: He thinks this right would require a contract or agreement. So maybe he believes rights are contractual, and without a contract, the poor can't demand aid. That sounds plausible if he's a contractualist.

Option C: The consequences of helping are worse than not helping. This is more about utilitarianism, where the outcomes matter. But the question is about rights, not consequences, so maybe not the main reason.

Option D: The right to aid is a negative right. Negative rights are about not being interfered with, but a right to aid would be a positive right, requiring others to act. So if Arthur thinks it's a negative right, he might say it doesn't exist. But I'm not sure if that's the main point.

Option E: He thinks rights are subjective. If rights aren't universal, then the poor can't have a right to aid. That could be a reason, but I'm not certain.

Option F: The affluent have earned their wealth and shouldn't share it. This seems more like a justification based on merit and property rights, which could be a reason.

Option G: Aid should be voluntary, not obligatory. So if someone doesn't want to help, they shouldn't have to. This is about义务 versus自愿, so maybe Arthur thinks aid shouldn't be forced.

Option H: Aid perpetuates poverty. He thinks it doesn't solve the root cause. That's a consequentialist argument against aid, but again, the question is about rights, not just consequences.

Option I: The poor are responsible for their own situation. Blaming the poor for their circumstances could be a reason, but does that tie directly to the right to aid? Maybe, but not sure.

Option J: Persons can never have a right to aid. That's a strong statement, but I don't know if that's Arthur's main point.

Now, thinking about the context. I remember that Robert Nozick, a libertarian philosopher, argued that there's no obligation to help others because rights are about not being forced to, not about providing for others. He believed in a minimal state and that people shouldn't be forced to aid others unless they've contracted to do so.

Wait, in Nozick's view, he might say that since there's no contract or agreement, the poor don't have a right to aid. That would tie back to option B. He also thought that people have a right to keep what they earn and aren't obligated to share, which is option F. But which is the main reason?

Alternatively, Nozick might argue that rights are negative and that a right to aid isn't a valid right because it would require others to act, which infringes on their rights. That would be option D.

But wait, I think Nozick's main argument against a positive right to aid is that it would require others to provide it, which would infringe on their freedoms. But he also emphasizes that rights are held against others' actions, not requiring others to act positively. So perhaps the right to aid isn't a valid right because it's a positive right, making option D.

Alternatively, he might say that because there's no contract, the poor don't have a right to aid, which is option B.

I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Nozick's article "The Justification of Rights" discusses that rights are claims against others' actions, not omissions. So a right to aid would require others to provide aid, which he doesn't think is a legitimate right. So he might argue that the right to aid is a positive right, which isn't valid, making option D.

But another angle is that he believes that without a contract, you can't have such a right, so option B.

Wait, in his essay "Ayn Rand's 'The Fountainhead'", he talks about rights as being based on mutual agreements. So perhaps he thinks that unless there's a contract, there's no obligation to provide aid. That would make option B the answer.

Alternatively, in "The libertarian answer to poverty", he might say that there's no obligation because it's not part of a contract, so the poor don't have a right to aid.

Hmm. I think the key is that Arthur (assuming he's Nozick) believes that rights derive from agreements or contracts. So without a contract, the poor can't claim a right to aid. So the answer is B.

The main reason why Arthur doesn't think the poor have a right to aid from the affluent is that he believes this right would require a contract or agreement, and since the affluent haven't entered into such a contract or agreement with the poor, they don't have a right to aid.

Answer: B
