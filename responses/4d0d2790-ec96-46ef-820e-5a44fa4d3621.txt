Okay, I'm trying to figure out which food is the cheapest and most nutritious based on price per calorie. Let's go through each option one by one.

First, the question is about price per calorie. So I need to think about how much each food costs and how many calories it has. The goal is to find the food that gives the most nutrition for the least money.

Option A: Bag of chips. Chips are usually high in calories but not very nutritious. They're also pretty cheap, but since they're high in calories and low in nutrients, their price per calorie might not be the best. Plus, they're not very filling, so maybe the price per calorie isn't the best value.

Option B: Chicken breast. Chicken breast is a good source of protein and relatively low in fat. It's also fairly priced, but I'm not sure how it compares to other options. It's definitely more nutritious than chips, but maybe there's something cheaper per calorie.

Option C: Banana. Bananas are fruits, so they're high in vitamins and fiber. They're also pretty affordable. Let me think about the calories. A medium banana has around 105 calories. So if a banana costs, say, $0.50, that's about $0.0047 per calorie. That seems pretty good.

Option D: Slice of bread. Bread has carbs and some nutrients, but it's not as nutrient-dense as vegetables or fruits. The price per calorie might be okay, but maybe not the best.

Option E: Pasta. Pasta is high in carbs and calories. It's usually affordable, but the calorie content is high, so the price per calorie might not be the best. Plus, it's not as nutritious as some other options.

Option F: Slice of pizza. Pizza has a lot of calories, but it's also high in sodium and fat. The price per calorie might not be great, and it's not very nutritious overall.

Option G: Apple. Apples are similar to bananas—affordable, high in fiber and vitamins. A medium apple has about 95 calories. If it's $0.30, that's roughly $0.0032 per calorie. That's even better than the banana.

Option H: Broccoli. Broccoli is very nutritious, high in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. It's also low in calories. But it can be a bit more expensive, especially if it's fresh. Let's say a cup of broccoli has about 34 calories. If it costs $2.00 per bunch, maybe that's more expensive per calorie than fruits.

Option I: Can of soda. Soda is high in calories (mostly from sugar) but offers no nutritional value. So the price per calorie here would be poor because it's not healthy and has empty calories.

Option J: Cheese burger. Burgers are high in calories and fat. They're usually more expensive, so the price per calorie might not be good, and they're not very nutritious.

Now, considering all options, the cheapest per calorie and most nutritious would likely be fruits like bananas or apples. Between G (apple) and C (banana), apples seem to have a slightly better price per calorie. However, I might have to check typical prices.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated. Let's take a specific example. A banana is about $0.50 for one. 105 calories, so 0.50 / 105 ≈ $0.00478 per calorie. An apple is about $0.30, 95 calories. 0.30 / 95 ≈ $0.00316 per calorie. So apples are cheaper per calorie than bananas.

But wait, broccoli might be more expensive. Let's say a bunch of broccoli is $2.50 and yields about 4 cups, each cup being 34 calories. So 4 cups = 136 calories. $2.50 / 136 ≈ $0.0183 per calorie. That's more expensive than apples and bananas.

So, looking at it, apples have the best price per calorie among the options. They're also very nutritious with lots of fiber and vitamins. So the answer should be G: Apple.

The answer is G: Apple.

The reasoning is that apples are affordable, high in nutrients, and have a low calorie count, making them the most cost-effective and nutritious option among the choices provided.

Answer: G
