Okay, so I need to figure out the total earnings for this employee. Let me see what the question says. The employee worked 43 hours and earns $3.00 per hour. But wait, there's time and a half for more than 40 hours per week. Hmm, right, time and a half means 1.5 times the regular pay for the extra hours beyond 40.

Alright, let's break it down. First, the regular hours are 40, so the first 40 hours are paid at the regular rate. Then, the remaining 3 hours (since 43-40=3) are paid at time and a half.

So for the regular hours: 40 hours * $3.00/hour. Let me calculate that. 40 * 3 = $120.

Now, for the overtime hours: 3 hours * 1.5 times the regular rate. The regular rate is $3, so 1.5 * 3 = $4.50 per hour. So 3 * 4.5 = $13.50.

Adding both parts together: $120 + $13.50 = $133.50.

Let me check the options. Option A is $133.50, which matches my calculation. So the answer should be A.

The employee worked 40 regular hours at $3.00/hour, earning $120. The remaining 3 hours were overtime, paid at 1.5 times the regular rate ($4.50/hour), totaling $13.50. Adding these gives $133.50.
