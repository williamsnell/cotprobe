Question:

Assume all gases are perfect unless stated otherwise. Note that 1 atm = 1.013 25 bar. Unless otherwise stated, thermochemical data are for 298.15 K.
Silylene $\left(\mathrm{SiH}_2\right)$ is a key intermediate in the thermal decomposition of silicon hydrides such as silane $\left(\mathrm{SiH}_4\right)$ and disilane $\left(\mathrm{Si}_2 \mathrm{H}_6\right)$. Moffat et al. (J. Phys. Chem. 95, 145 (1991)) report $\Delta_{\mathrm{f}} H^{\ominus}\left(\mathrm{SiH}_2\right)=+274 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$. If $\Delta_{\mathrm{f}} H^{\ominus}\left(\mathrm{SiH}_4\right)=+34.3 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$ and $\Delta_{\mathrm{f}} H^{\ominus}\left(\mathrm{Si}_2 \mathrm{H}_6\right)=+80.3 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$(CRC Handbook (2008)), compute the standard enthalpies of the following reaction:
$\mathrm{SiH}_4 (\mathrm{g}) \rightarrow \mathrm{SiH}_2(\mathrm{g})+\mathrm{H}_2(\mathrm{g})$

Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here. I'm a bit rusty on my thermochemistry, but let me try to think it through step by step. 

The question is about calculating the standard enthalpy change for the reaction where silane (SiH4) decomposes into silylene (SiH2) and hydrogen gas (H2). The reaction given is:

SiH4(g) → SiH2(g) + H2(g)

I remember that enthalpy changes are calculated using Hess's Law, which involves using the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔfH°) of the reactants and products. The formula I think is:

Δreaction H° = Σ ΔfH°(products) - Σ ΔfH°(reactants)

So I need to find the ΔfH° values for all the substances involved in this reaction.

Looking at the data provided:

- ΔfH°(SiH2) = +274 kJ/mol (given by Moffat et al.)
- ΔfH°(SiH4) = +34.3 kJ/mol (from the CRC Handbook)
- ΔfH°(H2) is zero because it's an element in its standard state. 

Wait, yes, the standard enthalpy of formation for any element in its standard state is zero. So H2(g) has ΔfH° = 0.

So, let's break down the reaction into the formation steps. The reaction produces one mole of SiH2 and one mole of H2, starting from one mole of SiH4.

In terms of formation reactions, I can write:

For the products:
1. SiH2(g): Its formation reaction is from elements. But since it's given, we don't need to construct it because we know its ΔfH°.
2. H2(g): As it's an element, its ΔfH° is 0.

For the reactant:
SiH4(g): Its formation reaction is also given, and ΔfH° is 34.3 kJ/mol.

So applying the formula:

Δreaction H° = [ΔfH°(SiH2) + ΔfH°(H2)] - [ΔfH°(SiH4)]

Plugging in the numbers:

Δreaction H° = [274 + 0] - [34.3] = 274 - 34.3 = 239.7 kJ/mol

Wait, that's approximately 240 kJ/mol. Looking at the options, option E is 240 kJ/mol, and option J is 210. Hmm, but wait did I do that right?

Wait, no, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check. The reaction is SiH4 → SiH2 + H2. So the stoichiometry is 1 mole each.

So the calculation is correct: 274 (SiH2) + 0 (H2) = 274. Then subtract the reactant: 34.3. So 274 -34.3 = 239.7, which rounds to 240 kJ/mol. So the answer should be E.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes the sign can be tricky. Let me think again. The reaction is the decomposition of SiH4 into SiH2 and H2. So the enthalpy of formation of the products minus the reactants.

Wait, if the ΔfH° of SiH4 is +34.3, that means it's endothermic to form SiH4 from its elements. And SiH2 has a much higher ΔfH°, +274, which is also endothermic but even more so.

So when SiH4 breaks down into SiH2 and H2, the process would likely be endothermic because you're going from a lower ΔfH° to a higher one. Because forming SiH2 requires more energy.

Wait, but let me clarify: The standard enthalpy change of reaction is (sum products) - (sum reactants). So if the reactant has a lower ΔfH°, then subtracting it would give a positive value.

So yes, 274 -34.3 = 240 kJ/mol positive. That would mean the reaction is endothermic, which makes sense because you're breaking bonds and forming higher energy substances.

So looking back at the options, option E is 240 kJ/mol.
</think>

The standard enthalpy change for the reaction is calculated using Hess's Law:

Δreaction H° = Σ ΔfH°(products) - Σ ΔfH°(reactants)

Given:
- ΔfH°(SiH2) = +274 kJ/mol  
- ΔfH°(SiH4) = +34.3 kJ/mol  
- ΔfH°(H2) = 0 kJ/mol (element in standard state)

For the reaction:
SiH4(g) → SiH2(g) + H2(g)

Δreaction H° = [ΔfH°(SiH2) + ΔfH°(H2)] - [ΔfH°(SiH4)]  
Δreaction H° = (274 + 0) - 34.3 = 239.7 kJ/mol ≈ 240 kJ/mol

Thus, the answer is E.
