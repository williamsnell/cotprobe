Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this insurance question. Let me read it again carefully. ThomasSidencarries property-damage insurance on his car with a limit of $5,000. He damages Frank Hartman's car in an accident to the extent of $2,350. The question is asking how much his insurance company will pay.

Hmm, I remember that property-damage insurance typically covers the cost of repairs to another person's vehicle when you're at fault in an accident. The limit mentioned is the maximum amount the insurance will pay for such damages. So, the insurance policy has a $5,000 limit, which I think means it will pay up to that amount for third-party property damage.

In this case, the actual damage is $2,350. Since this amount is less than the policy limit of $5,000, the insurance company should pay the full amount of the actual damages, right? They don't usually pay more than the policy limit unless there's some kind of coverage beyond that, but the question doesn't mention anything like that. So, the insurance would just cover the $2,350.

Looking at the options, option E is $2,350. That seems to match what I'm thinking. Let me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not missing anything. Option A is the full limit, which would be more than needed, so that's probably not it. Option E is exactly the actual damage, which is within the policy limit, so that makes sense. The other options either are less than the damage (like D, G, J) or more (like H, I), but since the damage is under the limit, the company should pay the full amount.

The insurance company will pay the full amount of the actual damage since it is under the policy limit.
