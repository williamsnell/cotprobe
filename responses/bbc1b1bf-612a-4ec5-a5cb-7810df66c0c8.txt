Okay, so I've got this question about meiosis and crossing-over. Hmm, I remember from biology class that meiosis is the process that produces gametes, right? And crossing-over is a part of that. Wait, what did crossing-over actually do again? Oh right, it's when homologous chromosomes exchange genetic material. That happens during prophase I, I think.

The question is asking what crossing-over allows scientists to determine. The options are A to J. Let me go through them one by one. 

Option A: the rate of mutations. I'm not sure, but I think mutations are random changes in DNA. Crossing-over is more about recombination of existing genes, not about mutation rates. So probably not A.

Option B: the chance for variation in zygotes. Oh, yeah, because crossing-over creates new combinations of alleles. That increases genetic diversity, which affects zygote variation. So B seems possible.

Option C: the age of an organism. That doesn't make sense. Crossing-over doesn't tell us about age; it's about genetics, not age. So C is out.

Option D: the potential for genetic disorders. Well, genetic disorders can be due to mutations or chromosomal abnormalities, but crossing-over itself isn't directly about disorders. Unless it's about how genes are arranged, but I'm not sure. Maybe, but I think it's more about variation.

Option E: the sequence of DNA bases. No, sequencing DNA is done through other methods, like PCR or sequencing technologies. Crossing-over doesn't determine the sequence; it's about rearranging existing segments. So E is wrong.

Option F: the rate of cell division. That's more about mitosis or the cell cycle, not meiosis's crossing-over. So F isn't it.

Option G: the number of chromosomes in a cell. Well, the number is determined by karyotyping, not crossing-over. Crossing-over affects which genes go where, but not the total count. So G is incorrect.

Option H: which traits are dominant or recessive. Dominance is about allele expression, not about their arrangement on chromosomes. Crossing-over doesn't determine dominance; it just shuffles them. So H is not the answer.

Option I: the sex of an organism. Sex is determined by sex chromosomes, but crossing-over doesn't determine sex. It's more about genetic variation. So I is out.

Option J: the distance between genes on a chromosome. Oh wait, that's right! Crossing-over is used to determine the order of genes on a chromosome. It's the basis for linkage and mapping. When genes are close together, they don't cross over as often. So the frequency of crossing-over between two genes can estimate the distance between them. So J sounds correct.

Wait, but the question is about what crossing-over permits scientists to determine. So the immediate effect is genetic variation (B), but the application is in mapping genes (J). The question might be looking for the application rather than the immediate effect. For example, by observing how often crossing-over occurs between certain genes, scientists can figure out their positions on the chromosome. So J is likely the correct answer.

But wait, let me think again. The question says "permits scientists to determine." So when they observe crossing-over events, they can infer the distance between genes. So J makes sense. However, another angle is that crossing-over increases variation, which is B. But the options are about what it allows them to determine, not just the effect. So perhaps it's both, but looking at the options, J is more about a specific application.

So the answer should be J.

The process of crossing-over during meiosis allows scientists to determine the distance between genes on a chromosome by analyzing the frequency of recombination events. This is because genes that are closer together on a chromosome are less likely to be separated by crossing-over compared to those that are farther apart. Therefore, the correct answer is:

J
