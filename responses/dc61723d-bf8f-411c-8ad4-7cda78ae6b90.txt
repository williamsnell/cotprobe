Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the homogeneous solution for the voltage across a capacitor in a series RLC circuit. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember what I learned in my circuits class.

Alright, the problem gives me R = 4 ohms, L = 4 henrys, and the capacitor has a capacitance of 1/2 farads. The initial conditions are i_L(0) = 1/4 A and v_C(0) = 0 V. I need to find the homogeneous solution for v_C(t).

First, I remember that in a series RLC circuit, the differential equation governing the voltage across the capacitor can be derived from Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL). The equation usually looks like a second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients.

So, the general form is L d²v_C/dt² + R dv_C/dt + (1/C) v_C = 0. Wait, no, because if we're considering the current through the inductor, which is i_L, and the voltage across the capacitor, v_C, I might need to express the equation in terms of i_L and v_C. Alternatively, since we're solving for v_C, maybe it's better to express everything in terms of v_C.

Wait, let's think again. In a series RLC circuit, the current through all components is the same. So, the current i(t) is the same through R, L, and C. The voltage across the resistor is iR, the voltage across the inductor is L di/dt, and the voltage across the capacitor is v_C = (1/C) ∫i dt. But maybe I can write a second-order equation for v_C.

Alternatively, taking the derivative of the current, since i = C dv_C/dt, and substituting into the KVL equation. Let me try that.

So, applying KVL: v_R + v_L + v_C = 0. That gives:

i R + L (di/dt) + (1/C) v_C = 0.

But since i = C dv_C/dt, substituting that in:

(C dv_C/dt) * R + L * d²v_C/dt² + (1/C) v_C = 0.

Let me write that as:

L d²v_C/dt² + R C dv_C/dt + (1/C²) v_C = 0.

Wait, no, let me check the substitution again. i = C dv_C/dt, so substituting into each term:

v_R = i R = C R dv_C/dt.

v_L = L di/dt = L d²v_C/dt².

v_C is just (1/C) ∫i dt, but wait, no. Wait, v_C is (1/C) times the integral of i dt, but that's the same as the derivative of v_C is i/C. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should express everything in terms of the current and then express in terms of voltage. Alternatively, another approach is to write the differential equation in terms of the current i(t), and then since v_C is the integral of i(t)/C, maybe it's easier to find i(t) first and then integrate to get v_C.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write the equation in terms of v_C.

Let me try that again. The equation from KVL is:

v_R + v_L + v_C = 0.

Which is:

i R + L (di/dt) + (1/C) v_C = 0.

But since i = C dv_C/dt, substitute that in:

(C dv_C/dt) R + L (d²v_C/dt²) + (1/C) v_C = 0.

So, rearranging:

L d²v_C/dt² + R C dv_C/dt + (1/C) v_C = 0.

Wait, let me check the coefficients. Yes:

- The first term is L times d²v_C/dt².

- The second term is R times C times dv_C/dt (since i R is C R dv_C/dt).

- The third term is (1/C) v_C.

So the equation is:

L d²v_C/dt² + R C dv_C/dt + (1/C) v_C = 0.

Now, plugging in the given values: L = 4 H, R = 4 Ω, C = 0.5 F.

So let's compute the coefficients:

L = 4.

R*C = 4 * 0.5 = 2.

1/C = 1/(0.5) = 2.

So the differential equation becomes:

4 d²v_C/dt² + 2 dv_C/dt + 2 v_C = 0.

Hmm, that's a homogeneous linear ODE with constant coefficients. To solve this, I'll find the characteristic equation.

The characteristic equation is: 4 r² + 2 r + 2 = 0.

Solving for r using the quadratic formula: r = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a).

Here, a = 4, b = 2, c = 2.

Discriminant D = b² - 4ac = (2)^2 - 4*4*2 = 4 - 32 = -28.

So D is negative, which means complex roots. So the roots will be:

r = [-2 ± sqrt(-28)] / (2*4) = [-2 ± i sqrt(28)] / 8.

Simplify sqrt(28) = 2 sqrt(7), so:

r = [-2 ± i 2 sqrt(7)] / 8 = [ -1 ± i sqrt(7) ] / 4.

Wait, that's because sqrt(28) is 2 sqrt(7), so 2 sqrt(7) divided by 8 is sqrt(7)/4.

So the roots are complex: α = -1/4, and ω = sqrt(7)/4.

Wait, but looking back, I think I might have made a mistake in calculating the coefficients. Let me double-check.

Wait, the initial equation after substitution was:

4 d²v_C/dt² + 2 dv_C/dt + 2 v_C = 0.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the characteristic equation is 4 r² + 2 r + 2 = 0.

Then, r = [-2 ± sqrt(4 - 32)] / 8 = [-2 ± sqrt(-28)] /8 = [-2 ± i sqrt(28)] /8.

Simplify sqrt(28) as 2 sqrt(7), so:

r = [ -2 ± i * 2 sqrt(7) ] /8 = [ -1 ± i sqrt(7) ] /4.

So the roots are α = -1/4, and ω = sqrt(7)/4.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see any options with sqrt(7) in them. All the options have 1/2 or 3/4 as coefficients. Hmm, that suggests I might have made a mistake in the setup of the differential equation. Maybe I should check that again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in substituting the values into the differential equation. Let me go back.

The original equation from KVL is:

L d²v_C/dt² + R C dv_C/dt + (1/C) v_C = 0.

Wait, does that make sense? Let me think again. I think I might have a mistake in the substitution. Because if i = C dv_C/dt, then substituting into v_R = i R gives v_R = C R dv_C/dt.

Then, v_L is L di/dt = L d²v_C/dt².

And v_C is (1/C) v_C. Wait, no. The voltage across the capacitor is v_C, which is (1/C) times the integral of i dt. But since i = C dv_C/dt, then integrating i gives C v_C = ∫i dt + Q(0). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to express everything in terms of the current i(t). Let's try that.

The KVL equation for the circuit is:

v_R + v_L + v_C = 0.

Which is:

i R + L di/dt + (1/C) ∫i dt = 0.

But that involves an integral, which complicates things. Alternatively, differentiating both sides to eliminate the integral.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to express everything in terms of current i(t). Then, since v_C = (1/C) ∫i dt, and taking the derivative of both sides: dv_C/dt = i/C. So i = C dv_C/dt.

But perhaps I should start by writing the ODE for the current i(t).

The KVL equation in terms of i(t) is:

i R + L di/dt + (1/C) ∫i dt = 0.

Let me differentiate the entire equation to make it a differential equation in terms of i.

Differentiating both sides: di/dt * R + L d²i/dt² + (1/C) i = 0.

So, L d²i/dt² + R di/dt + (1/C) i = 0.

That's a second-order ODE for i(t).

Plugging in the values: L =4, R=4, C=0.5.

So, 4 d²i/dt² +4 di/dt + 2 i = 0.

The characteristic equation is 4 r² +4 r +2 =0.

Divide through by 2: 2 r² + 2 r +1=0.

Solutions using quadratic formula: r = [-2 ± sqrt(4 -8)]/(4) = [-2 ± sqrt(-4)]/(4) = [-2 ± 2i]/4 = (-1 ± i)/2.

So the roots are r = -1/2 ± i (1/2).

Thus, the general solution for i(t) is e^(-1/2 t) [ A cos( (1/2) t ) + B sin( (1/2) t ) ].

But wait, the question is about v_C(t), and we're looking for the homogeneous solution. So, since v_C is the integral of i(t)/C, we can find v_C(t) by integrating i(t)/C.

So, i(t) = e^(-1/2 t) [ A cos( (1/2) t ) + B sin( (1/2) t ) ].

Then, v_C(t) = (1/C) ∫i(t) dt = 2 ∫ [ e^(-1/2 t) (A cos( (1/2) t ) + B sin( (1/2) t )) ] dt.

Let me compute the integral ∫e^(at) cos(bt) dt and ∫e^(at) sin(bt) dt, where a = -1/2 and b=1/2.

The integral of e^(at) cos(bt) dt is (e^(at) (a cos(bt) + b sin(bt)) ) / (a² + b²).

Similarly for the sine integral.

So, let's compute this:

∫ e^(-1/2 t) cos(1/2 t) dt.

Here, a = -1/2, b=1/2.

The integral would be e^(-1/2 t) [ (-1/2) cos(1/2 t) + (1/2) sin(1/2 t) ) ] / [ ( (-1/2)^2 + (1/2)^2 ) ].

Denominator: (1/4 + 1/4) = 1/2.

So, the integral becomes [ e^(-1/2 t) ( (-1/2) cos(1/2 t) + (1/2) sin(1/2 t) ) ] * 2.

Similarly, the integral of e^(-1/2 t) sin(1/2 t) dt is e^(-1/2 t) [ (-1/2) sin(1/2 t) - (1/2) cos(1/2 t) ) ] / (1/2) ) * 2.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute these integrals step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a more straightforward approach. Since the homogeneous solution for i(t) is as above, and v_C is the integral of i(t)/C, which is 2 ∫i(t) dt.

So, let me compute v_C(t) = 2 [ ∫ e^(-1/2 t) A cos(1/2 t) dt + ∫ e^(-1/2 t) B sin(1/2 t) dt ].

Let me compute each integral separately.

Integral 1: ∫ e^(-1/2 t) cos(1/2 t) dt.

We can use the formula for ∫ e^{at} cos(bt) dt:

= e^{at} [ a cos(bt) + b sin(bt) ] / (a² + b²) + C.

Here, a = -1/2, b = 1/2.

So,

= e^(-t/2) [ (-1/2) cos(t/2) + (1/2) sin(t/2) ] / ( ( (-1/2)^2 + (1/2)^2 ) ) + C.

Denominator: (1/4 + 1/4) = 1/2.

So,

= e^(-t/2) [ (-1/2 cos(t/2) + 1/2 sin(t/2) ) ] / (1/2) ) + C.

Dividing by 1/2 is multiplying by 2:

= e^(-t/2) [ (-1 cos(t/2) + sin(t/2) ) ] + C.

Similarly, Integral 2: ∫ e^(-1/2 t) sin(1/2 t) dt.

Using the formula for ∫ e^{at} sin(bt) dt:

= e^{at} [ a sin(bt) - b cos(bt) ] / (a² + b²) + C.

Here, a = -1/2, b = 1/2.

So,

= e^(-t/2) [ (-1/2) sin(t/2) - (1/2) cos(t/2) ) ] / (1/2) ) + C.

Again, denominator is 1/2, so multiply numerator by 2:

= e^(-t/2) [ (- sin(t/2) - cos(t/2) ) ] + C.

Now, putting it all together:

v_C(t) = 2 [ A * [ e^(-t/2) (-cos(t/2) + sin(t/2)) ] + B * [ e^(-t/2) (-sin(t/2) - cos(t/2)) ] ] + constants.

Wait, but perhaps I should factor this properly. Let me denote the integrals as I1 and I2.

So,

v_C(t) = 2 [ A I1 + B I2 ].

Where,

I1 = e^(-t/2) [ (-cos(t/2) + sin(t/2) ) ] + C1,

I2 = e^(-t/2) [ (-sin(t/2) - cos(t/2) ) ] + C2.

So,

v_C(t) = 2 [ A e^(-t/2) (-cos(t/2) + sin(t/2)) + B e^(-t/2) (-sin(t/2) - cos(t/2)) ] + constants.

But since we're looking for the homogeneous solution, we can ignore the constants (as initial conditions will determine them). So, grouping terms:

v_C(t) = 2 e^(-t/2) [ A (-cos(t/2) + sin(t/2)) + B (-sin(t/2) - cos(t/2)) ].

Let me expand this:

= 2 e^(-t/2) [ -A cos(t/2) + A sin(t/2) - B sin(t/2) - B cos(t/2) ].

Grouping like terms:

= 2 e^(-t/2) [ (-A - B) cos(t/2) + (A - B) sin(t/2) ].

We can write this as:

v_C(t) = 2 e^(-t/2) [ K cos(t/2) + M sin(t/2) ],

where K = - (A + B) and M = (A - B).

But in the solution, the constants are determined by initial conditions. So, let's apply the initial conditions to find K and M.

We know that at t=0, v_C(0) = 0.

Plugging t=0 into v_C(t):

v_C(0) = 2 e^(0) [ K cos(0) + M sin(0) ] = 2 [ K * 1 + M * 0 ] = 2K.

Set equal to 0: 2K = 0 => K = 0.

So, K = - (A + B) = 0 => A + B = 0 => B = -A.

Now, the other initial condition is i_L(0) = 1/4 A.

i_L is the current through the inductor, which is the same as the current i(t), since it's a series circuit. So, i(t) = i_L(t).

We know that i(0) = 1/4.

From earlier, i(t) = e^(-t/2) [ A cos(t/2) + B sin(t/2) ].

At t=0:

i(0) = e^0 [ A cos(0) + B sin(0) ] = 1 * (A * 1 + B * 0) = A.

Set equal to 1/4: A = 1/4.

Since B = -A, then B = -1/4.

Now, substitute A and B back into the expression for v_C(t):

v_C(t) = 2 e^(-t/2) [ 0 * cos(t/2) + (A - B) sin(t/2) ].

Wait, wait, earlier we had:

v_C(t) = 2 e^(-t/2) [ (-A - B) cos(t/2) + (A - B) sin(t/2) ].

But since K=0, this becomes:

v_C(t) = 2 e^(-t/2) [ (A - B) sin(t/2) ].

Now, substituting A=1/4 and B=-1/4:

A - B = (1/4) - (-1/4) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2.

So,

v_C(t) = 2 e^(-t/2) * (1/2) sin(t/2) = e^(-t/2) sin(t/2).

Wait, that's because 2 * (1/2) = 1.

So, v_C(t) = e^(-t/2) sin(t/2) volts.

Looking at the options, that's option H: e^-(1/2)t sin (1/2) t V.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps because I'm a bit confused why the solution ends up being this way. Did I make a mistake in the substitution of initial conditions?

Wait, let me recap. The general solution for i(t) is e^(-t/2) [ A cos(t/2) + B sin(t/2) ].

At t=0, i(0)=A = 1/4.

So A=1/4, and since from v_C(0)=0, we get K=0 which leads to B = -A = -1/4.

So i(t) = e^(-t/2) [ (1/4) cos(t/2) - (1/4) sin(t/2) ].

Then, v_C(t) = (1/C) ∫i(t) dt = 2 ∫i(t) dt.

So,

v_C(t) = 2 ∫ [ e^(-t/2) (1/4 cos(t/2) - 1/4 sin(t/2)) ] dt.

= (2*(1/4)) ∫ [ e^(-t/2) cos(t/2) - e^(-t/2) sin(t/2) ] dt.

= (1/2) [ ∫ e^(-t/2) cos(t/2) dt - ∫ e^(-t/2) sin(t/2) dt ].

We computed these integrals earlier.

From earlier, ∫e^(-t/2) cos(t/2) dt = e^(-t/2) [ (-cos(t/2) + sin(t/2) ) ] + C.

Similarly, ∫e^(-t/2) sin(t/2) dt = e^(-t/2) [ (- sin(t/2) - cos(t/2) ) ] + C.

So,

v_C(t) = (1/2) [ e^(-t/2) (-cos(t/2) + sin(t/2)) - e^(-t/2) (- sin(t/2) - cos(t/2)) ] + C.

Factor out e^(-t/2):

= (1/2) e^(-t/2) [ (-cos + sin) - (- sin - cos) ]

Simplify inside the brackets:

= (-cos + sin) + sin + cos = (-cos + cos) + (sin + sin) = 0 + 2 sin = 2 sin.

So,

v_C(t) = (1/2) e^(-t/2) * 2 sin(t/2 ) + C.

Which simplifies to:

v_C(t) = e^(-t/2) sin(t/2 ) + C.

Now, applying the initial condition v_C(0) = 0:

v_C(0) = e^0 sin(0) + C = 0 + C = 0 => C=0.

So, v_C(t) = e^(-t/2) sin(t/2 ) V.

Which matches option H: e^-(1/2)t sin (1/2) t V.

The problem involves finding the homogeneous solution for the voltage across a capacitor in a series RLC circuit. The given parameters are \( R = 4 \, \Omega \), \( L = 4 \, \text{H} \), \( C = \frac{1}{2} \, \text{F} \), \( i_L(0) = \frac{1}{4} \, \text{A} \), and \( v_C(0) = 0 \, \text{V} \).

### Step 1: Derive the Differential Equation
Using Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL), the governing differential equation for the current \( i(t) \) is:
\[
L \frac{d^2i}{dt^2} + R \frac{di}{dt} + \frac{1}{C} i = 0
\]
Substituting the given values:
\[
4 \frac{d^2i}{dt^2} + 4 \frac{di}{dt} + 2i = 0
\]
The characteristic equation is:
\[
4r^2 + 4r + 2 = 0
\]
Solving for \( r \):
\[
r = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 - 32}}{8} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{-16}}{8} = \frac{-1 \pm i}{2}
\]
Thus, the roots are \( r = -\frac{1}{2} \pm \frac{i}{2} \).

### Step 2: General Solution for Current
The general solution for the current \( i(t) \) is:
\[
i(t) = e^{-\frac{1}{2}t} \left( A \cos\left(\frac{t}{2}\right) + B \sin\left(\frac{t}{2}\right) \right)
\]
Using the initial condition \( i(0) = \frac{1}{4} \), we find \( A = \frac{1}{4} \). Using \( v_C(0) = 0 \), we determine \( B = -\frac{1}{4} \).

### Step 3: Voltage Across the Capacitor
The voltage across the capacitor is:
\[
v_C(t) = \frac{1}{C} \int i(t) \, dt = 2 \int e^{-\frac{1}{2}t} \left( \frac{1}{4} \cos\left(\frac{t}{2}\right) - \frac{1}{4} \sin\left(\frac{t}{2}\right) \right) dt
\]
Simplifying the integral:
\[
v_C(t) = e^{-\frac{1}{2}t} \sin\left(\frac{t}{2}\right)
\]

### Final Answer
The homogeneous solution for \( v_C(t) \) is:
\[
v_C(t) = e^{-\frac{1}{2}t} \sin\left(\frac{t}{2}\right) \, \text{V}
\]
This corresponds to **Option H**.
