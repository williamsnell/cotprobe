Okay, so I need to figure out this probability question about taxicabs. Let me read the problem again carefully.

The question says that taxicabs in a metropolitan area are driven an average of 75,000 miles per year, and the standard deviation is 12,000 miles. We're supposed to find the probability that a randomly selected cab has been driven less than 100,000 miles, given that it has been driven over 80,000 miles. They also mention to assume a normal distribution.

Hmm, so this is a conditional probability problem. I remember that conditional probability is about the probability of an event given that another event has occurred. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), which means the probability of A given B is the probability that both A and B happen divided by the probability of B.

In this case, event A is that the cab has been driven less than 100,000 miles, and event B is that it has been driven over 80,000 miles. So we need P(A|B) = P(80,000 < X < 100,000) / P(X > 80,000).

Wait, no, actually, event A is X < 100,000, and event B is X > 80,000. So the intersection A ∩ B would be 80,000 < X < 100,000. So yes, that's correct.

So the probability we're looking for is the probability that X is between 80k and 100k divided by the probability that X is greater than 80k.

Since the distribution is normal, we can use Z-scores to find these probabilities.

First, let's find the Z-scores for 80,000 and 100,000.

The formula for Z-score is Z = (X - μ) / σ, where μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation.

Mean μ =75,000, σ=12,000.

For X=80,000:
Z = (80,000 - 75,000) / 12,000 = 5,000 / 12,000 = 0.4167.

For X=100,000:
Z = (100,000 - 75,000) /12,000 =25,000 /12,000 ≈2.0833.

Now, we need to find P(80,000 < X <100,000) which is the same as P(0.4167 < Z <2.0833).

To find this, we can look up the standard normal distribution table or use a calculator for the probabilities.

First, P(Z < 2.0833) is the area to the left of Z=2.0833. Let's see, looking at the Z-table, 2.08 gives about 0.9816, and 2.09 is about 0.9838. Since 2.0833 is closer to 2.08, maybe around 0.9818 or so. Alternatively, using a calculator, 2.0833 corresponds to approximately 0.9816.

Then, P(Z <0.4167) is the area to the left of Z=0.4167. Let's see, 0.41 is about 0.6591, and 0.42 is about 0.6628. Since 0.4167 is halfway between 0.41 and 0.42, maybe around 0.6603.

So the area between Z=0.4167 and Z=2.0833 is 0.9816 - 0.6603 = approximately 0.3213. So that's P(A ∩ B) ≈0.3213.

Next, we need P(B), which is P(X >80,000), which is the same as P(Z >0.4167) = 1 - P(Z <0.4167) ≈1 - 0.6603 = 0.3397.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the area to the right of Z=0.4167 is 1 - 0.6603 = 0.3397. But wait, wait, that can't be right because the area to the left of Z=0.4167 is about 0.66, so the area to the right is 0.34. So the P(X >80,000) is 0.3397.

Wait, but 0.3397 is approximately 33.97%, which seems a bit low, but since 80k is above the mean of 75k, and the standard deviation is 12k, 80k is just a bit above the mean, so maybe that's correct.

So now, P(A|B) = 0.3213 / 0.3397 ≈ approximately 0.9459.

Wait, that seems high. Let me check if I did that correctly. Wait, 0.3213 divided by 0.3397 is roughly 0.946, which is approximately 0.94. Looking at the options, option E is 0.94. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might have messed up the Z-scores or the probabilities.

Let me recalculate the Z-scores.

X=80k: Z=(80,000-75,000)/12,000=5,000/12,000=0.4167.

X=100k: Z=(100,000-75,000)/12,000=25,000/12,000≈2.0833.

So that's correct.

Now, P(Z <2.0833) ≈0.9816.

P(Z <0.4167)=0.6603.

So the area between them is 0.9816-0.6603=0.3213.

P(Z >0.4167)=1-0.6603=0.3397.

So P(A|B)=0.3213/0.3397≈0.9459, which is about 0.946, so 0.94 is the closest option, which is E.

Alternatively, perhaps using more precise Z-table values would change it a little, but I think 0.94 is correct.

The problem involves calculating the conditional probability that a taxicab has been driven less than 100,000 miles given that it has been driven over 80,000 miles. Using the normal distribution with a mean of 75,000 miles and a standard deviation of 12,000 miles, we compute the Z-scores for 80,000 and 100,000 miles. The Z-scores are 0.4167 and 2.0833, respectively. Using the standard normal distribution table, we find the probabilities and calculate the conditional probability as the ratio of the area between the Z-scores to the area beyond 80,000 miles. The result is approximately 0.94, corresponding to option E.

Answer: E
