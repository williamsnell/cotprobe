Question:

A uniformed United States Park Policeman pulled over a motorist for going through a red light. The man reacted gruffly, telling the officer that he had no authority to stop him. There was a brief scuffle, and the officer issued two more charges, for disorderly conduct and failure to obey an officer. Eventually, the defendant pled guilty to the red light citation and the other two charges were dismissed. He then filed a federal court action against the park policeman in which he asserted a Bivens civil rights claim for false arrest and malicious prosecution. The first legal theory was that the park officer lacked authority to stop the plaintiff on a New York street and arrest him for a state traffic violation. He claimed that the officer was outside of his federal park land jurisdiction. Will the court likely uphold the authority of the park police under these facts?

Options:

A: The U.S. Park Police officer was within his rights to make an arrest, but he had to immediately transfer the defendant to state police.
B: The officer was within his authority to make the arrest, but only because the defendant acted in a disorderly manner and failed to obey an officer.
C: Federal officers, including the U.S. Park Police, cannot make arrests for state law violations under any circumstances.
D: The officer's authority to make an arrest depends on the specific agreement between the federal park system and the state of New York.
E: The federal officer is allowed to arrest for homicide and serious felonies but cannot make traffic arrests within a state's geographical jurisdiction.
F: The federal officer was way outside his scope of authority and he clearly cannot make an arrest outside of the confines of the federal park systems.
G: All federal officers can make arrests for all criminal offenses within a state's geographical jurisdiction under the priority status of federal law and federal law officers.
H: The U.S. Park Police have the authority to make a warrantless arrest for a state law violation because of statutory grants of authority from the various states.
I: All U.S. Park Police officers have nationwide jurisdiction and can make arrests for any offenses, regardless of whether they occur on federal or state land.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the court will uphold the authority of the U.S. Park Police officer in this case. Let me break this down. 

The scenario is that a Park Policeman pulled over a motorist for running a red light. The motorist got angry and told the officer he had no authority to stop him. Then there was a scuffle, leading to two more charges: disorderly conduct and failure to obey an officer. Eventually, the motorist pled guilty to the red light citation, and the other charges were dismissed. Now, he's suing under a Bivens claim, claiming false arrest and malicious prosecution. His main argument is that the Park Police officer lacked authority to stop him on a New York street for a state traffic violation because the officer was outside his federal jurisdiction.

I remember that Bivens claims are about holding federal officials liable for unconstitutional actions, so the issue here is whether the officer had the authority to make that arrest.

First, I should think about the jurisdiction of the U.S. Park Police. They are federal law enforcement officers, part of the National Park Service. Their authority usually comes from federal statutes. So, can they enforce state laws? I think there are some cases where federal officers can enforce state laws, but it's not automatic.

I recall the case of McCulloch v. Maryland, which established that federal authorities can act within states, but states can't impede federal operations. But that's more about the states' inability to tax federal entities, not about law enforcement powers.

Another point is the concept of "federal enclaves." The U.S. Park Police operate within federal lands, like national parks. But in this case, the incident happened on a New York street, which is state land. So, was the officer acting beyond his jurisdiction?

Wait, but sometimes federal officers have authority to make arrests for state crimes if they occur on federal property or if there's a specific agreement. But here, the traffic violation happened on a New York street, so state property. Unless there's a state statute allowing federal officers to enforce state laws, I'm not sure.

I think about Title 18 of the U.S. Code, which deals with criminal law, but that's for federal crimes. State traffic violations are state matters. However, there's a statute called 18 U.S.C. ยง 3551, which allows federal officers to make arrests for state crimes if they occur within a federal enclave. But a New York street isn't a federal enclave; it's state land. So that statute might not apply here.

Alternatively, maybe under the doctrine of "state cooperation," states can allow federal officers to enforce state laws. But unless New York has such an agreement, the Park Police might not have that authority. 

Looking at the options:

Option A says the officer had the right to arrest but had to transfer the defendant. I don't think that's necessarily correct because the issue is whether he had the authority to arrest in the first place, regardless of transferring.

Option B suggests arrest was valid due to disorderly conduct and failure to obey. But the initial stop was for a traffic violation, which is a state matter. The other charges might relate to his conduct during the encounter, but that doesn't give the officer jurisdiction over the traffic violation.

Option C says federal officers can't arrest for state violations ever. That seems too broad. I think there are exceptions, like on federal property or under specific agreements.

Option D says authority depends on the agreement between the federal park and the state. That makes sense because states can allow federal officers to enforce state laws if they agree.

Option E allows arrest for serious felonies but not traffic. Maybe, but the traffic violation is a misdemeanor, so perhaps not covered, but I'm not sure if that's the general rule.

Option F says the officer was way outside his authority. That could be the case if there's no agreement, but I'm not certain.

Option G claims all federal officers can arrest for all crimes in a state. That seems incorrect because states have their own laws, and federal officers usually can't enforce them unless permitted.

Option H says federal officers can make warrantless arrests under state statutory grants. So if New York allows it, then yes. But without such a grant, they can't.

Option I says Park Police have nationwide jurisdiction. That doesn't sound right; they usually have authority within federal lands.

So, considering all this, the most accurate answer seems to be D: The officer's authority depends on the specific agreement between the federal park and the state. If there's no such agreement, the officer couldn't arrest for the state traffic violation. But if there is, then he could. Since the question states it's a New York street, and without an agreement, probably the officer was outside his authority.

The U.S. Park Police officer's authority to make an arrest for a state traffic violation on a New York street depends on whether there is a specific agreement between the federal park system and the state of New York. Without such an agreement, the officer likely exceeded his jurisdiction. 

Answer: D
