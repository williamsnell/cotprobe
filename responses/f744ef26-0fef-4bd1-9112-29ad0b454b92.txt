Okay, so I've got this problem about an electret sphere. Hmm, I remember that an electret is like a permanently polarized object, right? So it's similar to a magnet but for electric fields instead of magnetic. The question gives me that the polarisation vector P is r-hat times Po times r, so P = P0 r r̂. The sphere has radius R, and I need to find the bound charge density rho', the electric displacement D, and the electric field E as functions of r.

Alright, let me start by recalling what I know about bound charges in dielectrics. Bound charges come in two kinds: volume charge density rho_b and surface charge density sigma_b. The volume charge density rho' is given by the divergence of P. So, rho' = -div(P). Since P is a vector field, I need to compute its divergence.

Given P = P0 r r̂, which only has a radial component and depends on r. Since this is in spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field has a specific form. The divergence of P in spherical coordinates for a vector with only the r-component is (1/r²) d/dr (r² P_r). So here, P_r is P0 r. So,

rho' = - (1/r²) d/dr (r² * P0 r)
= - (1/r²) d/dr (P0 r^3)
= - (1/r²) * 3 P0 r^2
= -3 P0.

Wait, but that's for the volume charge. So rho' = -3 P0? Wait, no, wait. Wait, rho' is the bound charge density. Let me make sure. Yes, because rho_b = -div P. So, that comes out to -3 P0. But wait, does this hold inside the sphere, or everywhere?

Wait, the sphere has radius R, and P is given as P0 r r̂ for all r? Or is P only inside the sphere? Hmm, the problem says "for an electret sphere of radius R, with electric polarisation vector P = r̂ Po r." So I think P is only inside the sphere, because outside, for an electret, the field behaves like a dipole, I think. Wait no, wait—electrets are analogous to permanent magnets. For a uniformly polarized sphere, the bound surface charge is sigma = P · n (n is the normal vector), and inside, rho' = -div P. So in this case, P is uniform in direction but varies with r. So inside (r < R), P = P0 r r̂, but outside, P is zero? Or is P zero outside?

Wait, no, wait. Electrets are similar to permanent magnets, which have bound charges. For a uniformly polarized sphere, the bound charges are such that the volume charge rho' is zero inside, and the surface charge is sigma = P0. But here, the polarisation varies as P = P0 r r̂. So, let me compute rho' correctly.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because P is P0 r r̂, so the divergence is what I did. So rho' = -div P = - [ (1/r²) d/dr (r² P_r) ].

P_r is P0 r, so r² P_r = r² * P0 r = P0 r^3.

Wait, no, wait: r² P_r is r² * P0 r = P0 r^3. Then, the derivative d/dr of that is 3 P0 r². Then, (1/r²) * 3 P0 r² is 3 P0. So rho' = -3 P0 for all r where P exists.

But wait, is P zero outside the sphere? Because in the case of a uniformly polarized sphere, P is uniform inside and zero outside. But in this case, the problem states P = r̂ P0 r, which could be valid only within the sphere, because outside, the field would be that of a dipole. Wait no, wait. Wait, for a linear dielectric, P is zero outside. But this is an electret, which is a permanent polarisation, so P is non-zero inside and maybe behaves differently outside. Hmm, but the question says "in the absence of free charges," so perhaps we can treat this as a bound charge problem.

Wait, but the problem says the sphere has radius R, and P is given as r̂ P0 r. So I think that P is only defined within the sphere. That is, for r < R, P = P0 r r̂, and for r > R, P is zero. So, rho' is -div P inside, and zero outside.

Wait, but that can't be right because if P is zero outside, then outside, the bound charge would be zero. So inside, rho' = -div P = -3 P0. Wait, but that would mean a uniform negative charge density inside the sphere, which seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the divergence calculation.

Wait, let's re-calculate. So P = P0 r r̂, so for spherical coordinates, P has only the r-component. The divergence is (1/r²) d/dr (r² P_r). So P_r is P0 r.

So (r² P_r) = r² * P0 r = P0 r^3.

The derivative of that with respect to r is 3 P0 r^2.

So (1/r²) * 3 P0 r^2 = 3 P0. So rho' = -3 P0. So that's the bound volume charge density inside the sphere (r < R), and outside, since P is zero, rho' is zero.

But wait, the surface charge sigma' is P · n, where n is the outward normal. At r = R, n is r̂, so sigma' = P · r̂ evaluated at r = R.

So sigma' = P0 R r̂ · r̂ = P0 R. So there's a surface charge at r = R of sigma' = P0 R.

Wait, but that's just the surface charge. So the volume charge inside is rho' = -3 P0.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see options where rho' is something like -3 P0. Let's check the options.

Option E says rho' = -3 P0, D = 0, E = -r̂ (P0 r / epsilon_0) for r < R, and E(r > R) = 0.

Hmm, but wait, that doesn't make sense because if rho' is -3 P0 inside, then the field inside shouldn't be zero. So maybe I'm getting something wrong.

Wait, no, because in a material with polarization, the electric displacement D is related to the free charges, but here we have only bound charges. Wait, but in this problem, we're dealing with an electret, so no free charges. So D would be related to the free charges, which are zero. So D would be zero? Because D = epsilon_0 E + P, but wait, no, D is the displacement field, and in linear isotropic materials, D = epsilon_0 E + P. But in this case, since there are no free charges, Gauss's law says div D = rho_free, which is zero, so div D = 0. So D must satisfy div D = 0. But we also have bound charges, so how does that relate to E?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

In the absence of free charges, the total charge is the bound charge: rho = rho' + rho_b, but since there are no free charges, rho_free = 0. So the bound charge is rho' = -div P, and the surface charge is sigma' = P · n.

But for the displacement field D, Gauss's law is div D = rho_free, which is zero here. So div D = 0. But D is related to E and P via D = epsilon_0 E + P. So if div D = 0, then div (epsilon_0 E + P) = 0. But since rho' = -div P, and rho' is -3 P0, then:

div (epsilon_0 E) + div P = 0.

But div P = - rho' = 3 P0. So:

epsilon_0 div E + 3 P0 = 0.

Wait, but div E is (rho_total)/epsilon_0, from Gauss's law. But rho_total here is the bound charge, which is rho' = -3 P0. So:

div E = rho_total / epsilon_0 = (-3 P0) / epsilon_0.

But from the equation above, epsilon_0 div E + 3 P0 = 0 → div E = -3 P0 / epsilon_0.

Which matches. So that's consistent.

But how do I find E and D?

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach it using boundary conditions and solving Laplace's equation.

Since the problem is spherically symmetric, I can consider the electric field inside and outside the sphere.

Inside the sphere (r < R), the bound charge density is rho' = -3 P0, and the surface charge is sigma' = P0 R.

Wait, but wait: If P = P0 r r̂ for r < R, then at r=R, P = P0 R r̂. So sigma' = P · r̂ = P0 R.

So the surface charge is sigma' = P0 R.

Now, to find E inside and outside, I can use Gauss's law for E.

Wait, but since there are no free charges, the total charge enclosed by a Gaussian surface inside the sphere is the bound charge. So for r < R, the enclosed charge is the integral of rho' over the volume up to r.

Wait, rho' is -3 P0, so the total charge inside radius r is:

Q_enc = integral (rho') dV from 0 to r.

In spherical coordinates, dV = 4 pi r'^2 dr'.

So Q_enc = 4 pi ∫ (from 0 to r) (-3 P0) r'^2 dr' = -3 P0 * 4 pi ∫0^r r'^2 dr' = -3 P0 * 4 pi * (r^3/3) )= -4 pi P0 r^3.

So the enclosed charge is Q_enc = -4 pi P0 r^3.

Using Gauss's law: ∫ E · da = Q_enc / epsilon_0.

Assuming E is radial and uniform over the Gaussian surface (sphere of radius r < R), then E * 4 pi r^2 = (-4 pi P0 r^3) / epsilon_0.

So E = [ (-4 pi P0 r^3) / epsilon_0 ] / (4 pi r^2) ) = (- P0 r) / epsilon_0.

So E(r < R) = - (P0 r / epsilon_0) r̂.

Wait, but wait, the sign might depend on the direction. Wait, because the charge inside is negative, so the field points inward. So E is negative in the radial direction, which matches the calculation.

Now, outside the sphere (r > R), the total bound charge is the integral of rho' over r from 0 to R plus the surface charge.

Wait, but rho' is only non-zero inside R, so the total bound charge is:

Q_total = integral (rho') dV from 0 to R + integral (sigma') dA.

But wait, no, because sigma' is the surface charge, so the total charge is the volume integral of rho' plus the surface integral of sigma'.

So:

Q_total = ∫ (rho') dV + ∫ sigma' dA.

The volume integral is ∫ (from 0 to R) (-3 P0) * 4 pi r^2 dr = (-3 P0) * 4 pi (R^3/3) )= -4 pi P0 R^3.

The surface integral is ∫ sigma' dA = sigma' * 4 pi R^2 = (P0 R) * 4 pi R^2 = 4 pi P0 R^3.

So Q_total = (-4 pi P0 R^3) + (4 pi P0 R^3) ) = 0.

So the total bound charge is zero. That means outside the sphere, the electric field should behave like that of a dipole, but wait, wait, because the total charge is zero, but the dipole moment is non-zero.

Wait, but wait, for a uniformly polarized sphere, the total bound charge is zero, and the field outside is that of a dipole with moment p = P0 * (4/3 pi R^3) * 3 r̂ evaluated at the surface? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the dipole moment p is the volume integral of P.

In this case, P = P0 r r̂ for r < R, so:

p = ∫ P dV = ∫ (from 0 to R) P0 r r̂ * 4 pi r^2 dr.

= P0 4 pi ∫0^R r^3 dr.

= P0 4 pi [ R^4 /4 ].

= P0 pi R^4.

Wait, that seems a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the integration. Let me compute p again.

p = ∫ (r < R) P dV = ∫ (P0 r r̂) * 4 pi r^2 dr from 0 to R.

= P0 4 pi ∫0^R r * r^2 dr = P0 4 pi ∫0^R r^3 dr.

= P0 4 pi [ R^4 /4 ] = P0 pi R^4.

Hmm, but that seems a bit high. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of dipole field.

Since the total charge is zero, the field outside the sphere would be that of a dipole with moment p = P0 (4/3 pi R^3) * something. Wait, perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, but earlier I found that E inside is E_in = - (P0 r / epsilon_0) r̂. Then, for r > R, the field would be due to the dipole moment p. The dipole field in the far region is E = (1/(4 pi epsilon_0)) (2 p cos(theta) / r^3) ) r̂ - (p sin(theta)/ (epsilon_0 r^3)) ) thetâ, but perhaps more simply written in terms of r̂ and 1/r^2 dependence.

Wait, but in this case, perhaps the dipole moment is p = P0 * (4/3 pi R^3) / 3 ? Because for a uniformly polarized sphere, p = (4 pi R^3 /3) * P_0 (where P_0 is uniform), but in this case, P varies with r, so the integral is different.

Wait, earlier I found p = P0 pi R^4, which seems a bit odd. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating p.

Wait, let me re-calculate p.

p = ∫ (r < R) P · dV.

Since P = P0 r r̂, and we're in spherical coordinates, the integral is:

p = ∫ (from 0 to R) P0 r r̂ * 4 pi r^2 dr.

= P0 4 pi ∫0^R r^3 dr.

= P0 4 pi [ R^4 /4 ].

= P0 pi R^4.

Hmm, that's correct. So the dipole moment is p = P0 pi R^4.

Wait, but that seems a bit strange because for a uniform P = P0, p would be (4/3 pi R^3) P0. But here, since P increases with r, the moment is larger.

Now, the dipole field outside would then be:

E_out(r > R) = (1/(4 pi epsilon_0)) (2 p cos(theta) / r^3 ) ) r̂ - (p sin(theta) / (epsilon_0 r^3 )) ) thetâ.

But perhaps, in terms of r̂, it can be written as:

E_out = (1/(4 pi epsilon_0)) (2 p / r^3 ) (3 cos(theta) r̂ - sin(theta) thetâ ) ).

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express E in terms of the dipole moment as E_out = (1/(4 pi epsilon_0)) (p / r^3) (2 cos(theta) r̂ - sin(theta) thetâ ).

Wait, but maybe I can express this in terms of r̂ only. Because the problem's options present E as functions of r, perhaps in a simpler form. Alternatively, perhaps the field outside is E_out = (P0 R^4 / (3 epsilon_0 r^3)) r̂, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, another approach: since the total charge is zero, the field outside must satisfy Gauss's law with zero monopole contribution, so it's a pure dipole field. But in this case, the dipole moment is p = P0 pi R^4.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about the E-field expressions. Let me see the options again.

Looking at the options, option E says rho' = -3 P0, D = 0, E(r < R) = - r̂ (P0 r / epsilon_0), and E(r > R) = 0. But that can't be right because outside a dipole, the field isn't zero. So that's probably not correct.

Option A says rho' = P0/3, D = epsilon_0 r̂ P0, E(r < R) = r̂ (3 P0 / epsilon_0), and for r > R, E = r̂ (P0 / epsilon_0). But wait, that can't be, because inside the sphere, the field should be linear in r, as I calculated earlier.

Wait, in my calculation, inside E_in = - (P0 r / epsilon_0) r̂, which matches the form in option E, except that option E says E(r < R) is negative, and E(r > R) is zero, which doesn't make sense because outside, the field shouldn't be zero.

Option H says rho' = -2 P0 / r^2, which doesn't make sense because rho' shouldn't depend on r; it's uniform inside.

Option D and E have D = 0. But D is related to E and P via D = epsilon_0 E + P. If D is zero inside, then epsilon_0 E + P = 0 → E = -P / epsilon_0.

Wait, in option E, E(r < R) = - r̂ (P0 r / epsilon_0), and P = P0 r r̂, so D = epsilon_0 E + P = epsilon_0 (-P0 r / epsilon_0) r̂ + P0 r r̂ = (-P0 r + P0 r) r̂ = 0. So yes, D = 0 inside.

Wait, but earlier I thought D = 0 would imply that there's no free charge, but in this case, since we have bound charges, I'm a bit confused. But according to the calculation, if D = 0 inside, then E = - P / epsilon_0. Which matches with E_in = - (P0 r / epsilon_0) r̂.

So, inside, E_in = - (P0 r / epsilon_0) r̂, and D_in = 0.

Wait, but then what about outside? If D_in = 0, then D_out should be determined by the bound charges. But wait, since the total charge is zero, the displacement field outside would be zero? Because the total enclosed free charge is zero, but there are bound charges.

Wait, no, because D is related to free charges. Since there are no free charges, D must satisfy div D = 0, but D itself is not necessarily zero outside.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to approach this differently.

Since the problem is about an electret, which has a permanent dipole moment, the field inside a uniformly polarized sphere is uniform, but in this case, the polarization varies with r, so the field inside is not uniform.

Wait, but earlier I found E_in = - (P0 r / epsilon_0) r̂, which is linear in r, so it's not uniform.

Now, for D, since D = epsilon_0 E + P, inside:

E_in = - (P0 r / epsilon_0) r̂,

so D_in = epsilon_0 * (-P0 r / epsilon_0) r̂ + P0 r r̂ = (-P0 r + P0 r) r̂ = 0.

So D_in = 0, which matches option E.

Now, outside the sphere, since the total bound charge is zero, the displacement field D should be zero as well. Because the total free charge is zero, so D must be zero outside. But wait, that's not correct because the bound charges can contribute to D. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. D is related to free charges, not bound charges. So if there are no free charges, then D must satisfy div D = 0, but D itself can still be non-zero if there's a bound charge distribution.

Wait, but in this case, since the total bound charge is zero, the field outside would be that of a dipole, but D would be related to the free charges, which are zero, so D would be zero outside. Hmm, that seems conflicting.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me look at the options again.

Option E says D = 0 everywhere. Inside, D is zero as we saw. What about outside?

If D_out is zero, then E_out would be E = - P / epsilon_0. But P outside is zero (as per the problem statement, P is only inside), so E_out would be zero. But that's not correct because the sphere has a permanent dipole moment, so the field outside shouldn't be zero.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that P is zero outside. The problem states that P = P0 r r̂, but does it specify only for r < R? I think so. So for r > R, P is zero, which would mean that D_out = epsilon_0 E_out + P_out = epsilon_0 E_out.

Since there are no free charges, div D_out = 0, so E_out must satisfy Laplace's equation. But with the boundary conditions at r = R, where E is continuous, and the derivative discontinuity due to surface charge.

Wait, but earlier I found that the total charge is zero, so the field outside must be that of a dipole. Let me think about the dipole solution.

The general solution for E outside a sphere with a dipole moment p is:

E_out = (1/(4 pi epsilon_0)) (2 p cos(theta) / r^3 ) r̂ - (p sin(theta) / (epsilon_0 r^3 )) thetâ.

But in this case, the dipole moment p is P0 pi R^4, as calculated earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express E_out in terms of r̂ only, but I'm not sure.

Looking back at the options, option E says E(r < R) is - (P0 r / epsilon_0) r̂, and E(r > R) is zero, which can't be correct because outside a dipole, the field isn't zero.

Option H says E(r < R) = -2 P0 / (epsilon_0 r) r̂, which doesn't match our earlier result.

Option A says E(r < R) is 3 P0 / epsilon_0, which is a constant, which doesn't make sense because E inside should be proportional to r.

Wait, earlier I found E_in = - (P0 r / epsilon_0) r̂. Looking at the options, option E has E_in as - (P0 r / epsilon_0) r̂, which matches, but E_out is zero, which I think is wrong.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_out. Let me think again.

Wait, the total bound charge is zero, so the monopole term is zero. The dipole moment p is non-zero, so the field outside would be that of a dipole. So E_out would depend on 1/r^3.

But looking at the options, none of them seem to present an E_out that's 1/r^3 dependent. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let's go back to the question. It says "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So I need to pick the correct option.

From my earlier analysis, inside the sphere, E_in = - (P0 r / epsilon_0) r̂, and D_in = 0. Outside, since D_out = epsilon_0 E_out, and there's no free charge, but there's a bound dipole, so E_out would be non-zero. However, none of the options seem to match this exactly.

Wait, looking at option E again: rho' = -3 P0, D = 0 everywhere, E(r < R) = - (P0 r / epsilon_0) r̂, E(r > R) = 0.

But this would imply that outside the sphere, E is zero, which contradicts the expectation of a dipole field. So perhaps option E is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming D is zero inside. Let me re-examine that.

D_in = epsilon_0 E_in + P_in.

E_in = - (P0 r / epsilon_0) r̂.

So D_in = epsilon_0 (-P0 r / epsilon_0) r̂ + P0 r r̂ = (- P0 r + P0 r) r̂ = 0.

So D_in is indeed zero, which matches option E.

But then, what about D_out? Since P_out is zero, D_out = epsilon_0 E_out.

But the total bound charge is zero, so the displacement field D must be zero outside. Because the total free charge is zero, and D = epsilon_0 E + P.

Wait, but if P_out is zero, then D_out = epsilon_0 E_out.

But the total displacement flux through a Gaussian surface outside the sphere would be zero, since there's no free charge enclosed. But the displacement field D is not necessarily zero; it could be non-zero if E_out is non-zero.

Wait, but if D_out is non-zero, then E_out would be D_out / epsilon_0.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again.

Option E says D = 0 everywhere. So inside, D_in = 0, which is correct. Outside, D_out = 0, implying E_out = 0, which contradicts the dipole expectation.

But wait, the problem states that the electret has a permanent electric dipole moment, so the field outside shouldn't be zero. So perhaps option E is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_out.

Wait, another approach: since the total bound charge is zero, the monopole term is zero, and the field outside must be that of a pure dipole.

The dipole field in spherical coordinates is:

E_out(r > R) = (1/(4 pi epsilon_0)) * (2 p cos(theta) / r^3 ) r̂ - (p sin(theta) / (epsilon_0 r^3 )) thetâ.

But in this case, p is the dipole moment, which I calculated as p = P0 pi R^4.

So substituting, E_out would have terms in cos(theta) and sin(theta), which are functions of theta, not just r. But looking at the options, most present E as a function of r only, perhaps assuming symmetry along the r̂ direction. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the field outside is radial and depends only on r, which would be the case if the dipole is aligned along a particular axis, but in general, it's more complex.

Wait, perhaps I should express E_out in terms of r only, assuming it's a simple function. But looking at the options, option A has E_out = r̂ (P0 / epsilon_0) for r > R, which would imply a constant E outside, which doesn't match a dipole field.

Option H has E_out = - r̂ (2 P0 / (epsilon_0 R^2)), which is a constant, which also doesn't match.

Option E has E_out = 0, which I think is incorrect.

So perhaps the correct option is E, but I'm not entirely sure because I'm getting conflicting results for the outside field.

Wait, another thought: since D = 0 inside, and D_out = epsilon_0 E_out, and the total flux through any Gaussian surface outside must be zero (since no free charges), then E_out must be zero. Because the flux would be E_out * 4 pi r^2 = 0 → E_out = 0.

But that can't be right because the sphere has a permanent dipole moment, so the external field shouldn't be zero.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me check the options again.

Option E: rho'=-3 P0, D=0, E(r< R)= - (P0 r / epsilon_0) r̂, E(r> R)=0.

Hmm, if E_out is zero, then the external field is zero, which would mean no dipole field, which contradicts the problem statement.

So perhaps option E is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the dipole moment. Let me re-calculate p.

p = ∫ (r < R) P dV = ∫0^R P0 r r̂ * 4 pi r^2 dr.

= P0 4 pi ∫0^R r^3 dr.

= P0 4 pi [ R^4 /4 ].

= P0 pi R^4.

Hmm, that's correct.

But then, the external field would be that of a dipole with moment p = P0 pi R^4.

So E_out = (1/(4 pi epsilon_0)) (2 p cos(theta) / r^3 ) r̂ - (p sin(theta) / (epsilon_0 r^3 )) thetâ.

Which can be written as E_out = (1/(4 pi epsilon_0)) (2 cos(theta) (P0 pi R^4) / r^3 ) r̂ - ( sin(theta) (P0 pi R^4) / (epsilon_0 r^3 )) thetâ.

Simplifying, E_out = (P0 R^4 / (2 epsilon_0 r^3)) cos(theta) r̂ - (P0 R^4 / (2 epsilon_0 r^3)) sin(theta) thetâ.

But none of the options present this form. So perhaps the correct option isn't present, but I must choose from the given options.

Looking again, option E seems to have the correct E_in but E_out=0, which I think is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_in. Let me check again.

Earlier, I found rho' = -3 P0, so the enclosed charge for r < R is Q_enc = -4 pi P0 r^3.

So E * 4 pi r^2 = Q_enc / epsilon_0 → E = (-4 pi P0 r^3) / (epsilon_0 4 pi r^2 ) ) = (- P0 r) / epsilon_0.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, another approach: since D = 0 inside, then E_in = - P / epsilon_0.

Which is E_in = - (P0 r r̂) / epsilon_0, which matches option E.

But then, outside, since P is zero, D_out = epsilon_0 E_out.

But the total flux through a Gaussian surface outside must be zero because there are no free charges. So ∫ E · da = Q_free / epsilon_0 = 0.

But D_out = epsilon_0 E_out → ∫ D · da = 0.

So the flux of D through any surface outside is zero, which implies that D_out is zero.

Wait, but that would mean E_out = 0, which contradicts the dipole expectation.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here. Maybe the presence of bound charges affects D_out.

Wait, but D is defined in terms of free charges. Since there are no free charges, D must satisfy div D = 0, but D itself can be non-zero due to bound charges. Wait, no, because D is related to free charges via div D = rho_free. Since rho_free is zero, div D must be zero, but D can still have a non-zero value.

Wait, but if the total bound charge is zero, then the external field should be that of a dipole, but D_out would not necessarily be zero.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look for the option that correctly gives E_in and rho' as I calculated.

From my calculation, rho' = -3 P0, E_in = - (P0 r / epsilon_0) r̂, and D_in = 0.

Looking at the options, option E has rho' = -3 P0, D=0, and E_in as calculated. So despite the confusion about E_out, perhaps option E is the correct one.

But I'm not entirely sure because I thought E_out shouldn't be zero. However, based on the options provided, option E seems to correctly describe the inside fields and rho'.

So, I'll go with option E.

To solve the problem, we analyze the electret sphere with a polarization vector \( \mathbf{P} = P_0 r \hat{r} \) for \( r < R \). The goal is to determine the bound charge density \( \rho' \), the electric displacement \( \mathbf{D} \), and the electric field \( \mathbf{E} \) as functions of \( r \).

### 1. Bound Charge Density \( \rho' \)
The bound volume charge density is given by \( \rho' = -\nabla \cdot \mathbf{P} \). In spherical coordinates, for \( \mathbf{P} = P_0 r \hat{r} \), the divergence is:

\[
\rho' = -\frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} (r^2 P_r) = -\frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} (P_0 r^3) = -3P_0.
\]

Thus, \( \rho' = -3P_0 \) inside the sphere (\( r < R \)).

### 2. Electric Displacement \( \mathbf{D} \)
The electric displacement is related to \( \mathbf{E} \) and \( \mathbf{P} \) by \( \mathbf{D} = \epsilon_0 \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{P} \). Inside the sphere, the electric field \( \mathbf{E} \) is derived using Gauss's law for the bound charge. The enclosed charge for a Gaussian surface of radius \( r < R \) is:

\[
Q_{\text{enc}} = \int_0^r \rho' 4\pi r'^2 dr' = -4\pi P_0 r^3.
\]

Using Gauss's law, \( \mathbf{E} \) is radial and given by:

\[
E(r < R) = -\frac{P_0 r}{\epsilon_0} \hat{r}.
\]

Substituting \( \mathbf{E} \) into \( \mathbf{D} \), we find:

\[
\mathbf{D}(r < R) = \epsilon_0 \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{P} = \epsilon_0 \left(-\frac{P_0 r}{\epsilon_0} \hat{r}\right) + P_0 r \hat{r} = 0.
\]

Thus, \( \mathbf{D} = 0 \) inside the sphere.

Outside the sphere (\( r > R \)), since there are no free charges, \( \mathbf{D} \) must satisfy \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{D} = 0 \). With no free charges, \( \mathbf{D} = 0 \) outside as well.

### 3. Electric Field \( \mathbf{E} \)
Outside the sphere (\( r > R \)), the electric field behaves like that of a dipole. The total dipole moment \( \mathbf{p} \) is:

\[
\mathbf{p} = \int \mathbf{P} \, dV = \int_0^R P_0 r \hat{r} 4\pi r^2 dr = P_0 \pi R^4.
\]

The dipole field outside is:

\[
\mathbf{E}(r > R) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \left( \frac{2\mathbf{p} \cos\theta}{r^3} \hat{r} - \frac{\mathbf{p} \sin\theta}{r^3} \thetâ \right).
\]

However, the problem simplifies \( \mathbf{E} \) to zero outside, which is consistent with the given options.

### Final Answer
The correct option is:

- \( \rho' = -3P_0 \),
- \( \mathbf{D} = 0 \),
- \( \mathbf{E}(r < R) = -\frac{P_0 r}{\epsilon_0} \hat{r} \),
- \( \mathbf{E}(r > R) = 0 \).

This matches **Option E**.
