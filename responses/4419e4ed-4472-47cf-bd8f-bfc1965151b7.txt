Okay, I need to figure out which statement about the Box-Pierce Q and Ljung-Box Q* statistics is incorrect. Let me start by recalling what I know about these tests.

Both Box-Pierce Q and Ljung-Box Q* are used to test for linear dependence in time series data, specifically to check if there's autocorrelation. They are similar but have some differences, especially regarding their performance in small samples.

From what I remember, the Box-Pierce test was one of the earlier tests for autocorrelation. It calculates a statistic Q which is a transformation of the sum of squared autocorrelation coefficients. However, I think it has some issues, especially in small sample sizes. I remember reading that it can be oversized, meaning it might reject the null hypothesis more often than it should, leading to higher Type I errors.

Then there's the Ljung-Box Q* test, which is an improvement over Box-Pierce. I think it adjusts the Box-Pierce statistic by dividing by an estimate of the variance of the autocorrelation coefficients. This adjustment makes the Q* test have better small-sample properties. So, it's more accurate in smaller samples and has better control over the Type I error rate.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Asymptotically, the two test statistics are equal. I think this is correct because as the sample size grows, both tests should converge to the same distribution under the null hypothesis. So A is likely correct, making it not the incorrect statement.

Option B: The Q test has better small-sample properties than Q*. Wait, no, I thought it's the opposite. Ljung-Box Q* was developed to fix the issues with Box-Pierce Q, especially in small samples. So Q* should have better small-sample properties, making B incorrect. So B is probably the incorrect statement, so the answer might be B.

Option C: The Q test is sometimes over-sized for small samples. Yes, that's correct. Box-Pierce Q tends to be over-sized in small samples, as I thought earlier. So C is a true statement, not incorrect.

Option D: As sample size increases, both tests tend to reject the null when there's no autocorrelation. Wait, no. If there's no autocorrelation, the null is true, and as sample size grows, the tests should approach their asymptotic distributions, which are chi-squared. If the null is true, the tests shouldn't tend to reject. But if the alternative is true, meaning there is autocorrelation, then as sample size increases, the tests should have power to reject. But the option says "tend to always reject the null," which would imply they are not consistent. However, both tests are consistent; under the null, as n→∞, the test statistics approach a chi-squared distribution, so if the null is true, the probability of rejection goes to zero. So D is incorrect because both tests are consistent and won't tend to reject the null when it's true. Wait, but the way the option is phrased says "tend to always reject," which would be incorrect. So D is incorrect.

Wait, but I thought the Q test has a problem with being over-sized in small samples but is consistent asymptotically. So as n increases, both Q and Q* become consistent, meaning they correctly reject the null when there's autocorrelation. So D says that as n→infty, both tests will tend to always reject the null of zero autocorrelation. That's not correct. If the null is true, the tests shouldn't reject. So D is an incorrect statement. 

Wait, but the question is which statement is incorrect concerning the comparison. So if D is incorrect, then D is the answer. But earlier I thought B was incorrect because it said Q has better small-sample properties than Q*, which is wrong because Q* is better. So now I'm a bit confused. Let me reevaluate.

The options are:

A: Asymptotically, the values are equal. Correct.

B: Q has better small-sample properties than Q*. Incorrect because Q* is better.

C: Q is sometimes over-sized for small samples. Correct.

D: As n→infty, both tests tend to always reject the null. Incorrect because if null is true, they won't reject.

So the question is asking for the incorrect statement. So both B and D are incorrect statements. But the options are only one answer.

Wait, the question is which is incorrect concerning the comparison. Let me think again.

Option D says that as sample size tends to infinity, both tests will tend to always reject the null. That's not correct. If the null is true, the tests shouldn't reject; they should converge to the correct distribution. So D is incorrect.

But the original question is asking for the incorrect statement about the comparison. So the incorrect statements would be either B or D.

Wait, the options are:

The question is about which statement is incorrect. So both B and D are incorrect, but the options are A-J, so perhaps only one is incorrect in the context.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify.

The Box-Pierce Q test has a statistic that is asymptotically equal to the chi-squared distribution. The Ljung-Box Q* is a modified version that adjusts for small sample bias. So asymptotically, both will have the same distribution, so A is correct.

The Q test (Box-Pierce) is known to have poor small-sample properties, being over-sized. The Q* test (Ljung-Box) is an improvement, so it has better small-sample properties than Q. So B says Q has better small-sample properties than Q*, which is wrong. So B is incorrect.

Option D says as n→infty, both tests will tend to always reject the null. But that's not correct. Both tests are consistent, so if the null is true, they won't reject. If the alternative is true, they will reject. So D is incorrect because it's saying that regardless of the null being true or not, as n increases, they will reject. But the phrasing is "tend to always reject the null hypothesis of zero autocorrelation coefficients." That would mean the tests will reject the null even when it's true, which is not the case. So D's statement is incorrect.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is incorrect. So if both B and D are incorrect, but the options only have one correct answer, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the original options are A to J, but the user only provided A to D. So perhaps the options are only A to D, and only one is incorrect.

Wait, the options given are A to D.

So the incorrect statements would be B and D. But the question is which is incorrect concerning the comparison.

Wait, perhaps D is incorrect because both tests are consistent, meaning that as n→infty, if the null is false, they will reject, but if it's true, they won't. So D's statement is wrong because it implies that regardless of the null, they will reject, which is not true.

So the incorrect statements are B and D. But the question is which one is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the options.

The question is which statement is incorrect. So:

A: Asymptotically, the two test statistics will be equal. Correct, as both approach the same chi-squared distribution.

B: The Q test has better small-sample properties than the Q*. Incorrect, because Q* is better.

C: Q test is sometimes over-sized for small samples. Correct.

D: As n→infty, both tests will show a tendency to always reject the null. Incorrect because they won't always reject; they are consistent, so under the null, the probability of rejection goes to zero.

So both B and D are incorrect statements. But the options only allow one choice.

Wait, but the question is to pick the incorrect statement concerning the comparison. So perhaps the incorrect statements are B and D. But the options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D. Let me think again.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The Q and Q* statistics, when the null is true, their test statistics converge to a chi-squared distribution. So as n increases, the tests become more accurate, and if the null is true, the probability of Type I error approaches zero. So D's statement is incorrect because it says they will "tend to always reject the null," which is the opposite of what happens.

But the question is about which statement is incorrect. So both B and D are incorrect. But since the options are A to D, perhaps only one is intended as incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B, because the other options are correct. Let me think again.

Yes, I think the answer is B and D. But the question expects one answer. So perhaps the intended incorrect statement is B, as D is a more obvious incorrect statement.

Wait, but I think D is incorrect because both tests are consistent, so as n increases, they won't reject the null when it's true. So D is incorrect.

But the user's options are A to D, and the question is which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should check some sources.

From what I recall, the Box-Pierce Q test tends to have worse small-sample properties (over-sized), and the Ljung-Box Q* corrects this, so has better small-sample properties. So B is incorrect because it says Q has better properties than Q*, which is wrong.

Regarding D, the tests are consistent, so as n increases, the tests correctly identify the null as true or false. So D is incorrect because it says they will tend to always reject, which isn't the case.

So both B and D are incorrect, but the options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, perhaps the intended incorrect statement is B. Alternatively, perhaps D is incorrect because it's a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the option D is incorrect because it says both tests will tend to always reject the null as n increases, which is not the case. So D is the incorrect statement.

But I'm a bit confused because both B and D seem incorrect. However, the question is about which is incorrect concerning the comparison. So perhaps the incorrect statement is B, as D is a more general misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

The Box-Pierce Q statistic is known to have poor small-sample properties, being over-sized. The Ljung-Box Q* is an adjusted version that corrects this issue, so it has better small-sample properties. So statement B says Q has better small-sample properties than Q*, which is false. Therefore, B is incorrect.

As for D, the statement says as sample size tends to infinity, both tests will tend to always reject the null. That's incorrect because if the null is true, the tests should approach a chi-squared distribution, and the probability of rejection approaches zero. So D is incorrect.

Wait, but the question is asking for the incorrect statement about the comparison. So both B and D are incorrect, but perhaps the intended answer is B, as that's a direct comparison.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D because it's a misunderstanding of the tests' behavior. As sample size increases, the tests become more powerful, but they don't tend to always reject the null. So D is incorrect.

But I'm not entirely sure, but I think the primary incorrect statement is B. So I think the answer is B.
</think>

The Box-Pierce Q test and the Ljung-Box Q* test are both used to detect linear dependence in time series data. The Box-Pierce Q test is known for having poor small-sample properties, often being over-sized, meaning it may reject the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation more frequently than it should. In contrast, the Ljung-Box Q* test improves upon this by adjusting the Box-Pierce statistic, providing better small-sample properties. Therefore, the statement that the Q test has better small-sample properties than the Q* test is incorrect. Additionally, both tests are consistent, meaning that as the sample size grows, they correctly reject the null hypothesis when it is false and fail to reject it when it is true. Thus, the claim that both tests tend to always reject the null hypothesis as the sample size increases is also incorrect. However, the primary focus is on the comparison of the two tests, making the incorrect statement about small-sample properties the most relevant answer.
