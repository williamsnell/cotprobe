B: The demand for land is linked to the cultural significance attached to certain locations.
C: The demand for land is derived from the availability of natural resources.

Okay, so I have this economics question about derived demand, specifically regarding a factor of production like land. I need to figure out which option correctly explains how the demand for land is derived.

First, I remember that derived demand means that the demand for a good or service arises because it's needed to produce something else. So, people don't want land itself, but they want what land can produce. For example, if land is used for farming, the demand for land comes from the demand for agricultural products.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the demand is from government infrastructure plans. That's a possibility because the government might need land for roads or buildings, but is that the main reason? I'm not sure. It seems more like a specific instance rather than the general reason for derived demand.

Option B talks about cultural significance. That might affect land prices in certain areas, but it's not about production. So probably not the right answer.

Option C suggests it's from the availability of natural resources. Hmm, land itself is a natural resource, but I think the demand for land as a factor of production is more about using it to produce goods, not the resources it has. So maybe not C.

Option D is about speculative investments. That's more about financial markets buying land as investments, which can create demand, but is that derived demand? Derived demand is because it's used in production, not just because people think it'll increase in value. So D might not be the best choice.

Option E is about predictions of future trends. That's more about expectations affecting demand, but again, not necessarily derived demand.

Option F says the demand is derived from consumers' desires for final goods. That makes sense because if consumers want products made on land, like crops or buildings, then businesses will demand land to produce those goods. This seems like a good candidate.

Option G is about businessmen's personal interests. That might influence some decisions, but it's not a systematic reason like derived demand.

Option H mentions educational institutions needing land. That's a specific case, not the general reason for derived demand.

Option I is based on historical patterns. While history can influence current demand, it's not the derivation from producing goods.

Option J talks about complementary factors. If land is used with other factors, but the demand for land itself is because it's needed to produce something else, so J might be a bit indirect.

Putting it together, the demand for land as a factor of production comes from the demand for the goods it helps produce. So, consumers wanting final goods drive the demand for land. That points to option F.
</think>

The demand for land as a factor of production is derived because it is needed to produce goods and services that consumers desire. This means that businesses require land to grow crops, build structures, or engage in other productive activities that satisfy consumer needs. Therefore, the demand for land is not direct but stems from the demand for the final products that land helps to create.

Answer: F
