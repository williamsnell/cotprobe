Okay, so I've got this electrical engineering problem here. It's about a three-phase three-wire system supplying two balanced Y-connected loads. Hmm, I remember that in a balanced three-phase system, the line currents are all equal, but wait, here it's a three-wire system, so maybe the line currents are the same as the phase currents? Or do I need to consider something else?

The problem states that each line carries 8A RMS. Wait, no, wait—the question is about the current in each line, but when it comes to the source phase current, I think that's different. Wait, no, in a three-phase system, the line currents are the same as the phase currents because each line is connected to a phase. So if each line is 8A, then each phase in the source is also 8A? Or maybe not, because when you have Y-connected loads, the line currents might not all be the same as the phase currents. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the question is asking for the current in the first load, second load, and the source phase. Let me break it down.

First, the system is balanced three-phase three-wire, so the line voltages are equal and 120 degrees apart. Both loads are Y-connected and balanced, so each load's phase currents should be balanced as well.

The first load draws 6 kW at 0.8 PF lagging. The second requires 12 kW at 0.833 PF leading. Each line current is 8A. We need to find the phase currents for each load and the source phase current.

Wait, each line current is 8A RMS. But in a three-wire system, the line currents could be different if the loads are unbalanced. But in this case, the two loads are balanced, so maybe the line currents are all the same? Hmm, but each load is Y-connected, so perhaps the line currents are the same as the phase currents for each load.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me try to approach this step by step.

First, for each load, I can find the phase current using the power and power factor.

For the first load (6kW, 0.8 lagging PF):

Power (P) = V_phase * I_phase * cosφ

But wait, in a Y connection, the line voltage is √3 times the phase voltage. But wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The line voltage (VL) in a Y-connected load is √3 times the phase voltage (Vph). So V_L = √3 * Vph.

But maybe it's easier to use the formula for power in terms of line voltage and phase current.

Wait, another approach: since the load is Y-connected, the phase current is the same as the line current for that phase. Wait no, because each line carries the current of one phase of the load. Wait, perhaps I should model the system.

Let me consider the two Y-connected loads connected to the same three-phase source. Each load is connected in Y, so each has a neutral point. But in a three-wire system, there's no neutral conductor, so perhaps each load is connected between the three lines? Or maybe each load is connected to two lines and a common point, but that's more like a star with a neutral, which isn't present here. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model each load as a Y-connected load without a neutral, meaning that each load's phases are connected between the three lines. Wait, no, that's more like a delta connection. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of each load being a Y-connected with the three lines, but that's not possible without a neutral. Maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps each load is connected in a Y configuration, but without a neutral, so each load's three phases are connected to the three lines. So each line has two loads connected across it and another line. Hmm, but that's a bit tricky.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about each load as a Y-connected with line voltages. So each load's phase voltage is the line voltage, and the line voltage is the same for all three lines in a balanced system.

Wait, each line has a current of 8A. Since it's a three-wire system, the sum of the currents in the lines should be zero because it's a balanced system. So the line currents are balanced, meaning each line has 8A, but their phase angles are 120 degrees apart.

But the problem states that each line is 8A. So the line currents are all 8A. But wait, each line carries the current from one phase of each load. So the line current is the sum of the two phase currents from each load on that line.

Wait, no. Wait, if each load is Y-connected, then each load's phase current is the same in each of its three phases. So for the first load, current in each phase is I1, and for the second load, current in each phase is I2. Since the lines are shared, the total current in each line is I1 + I2 for that line. But wait, in a balanced three-phase system, the line currents would be the sum of the two phase currents from each load on that line.

Wait, but the problem says that each line is 8A. So for each line, the current is I1 + I2 = 8A. But since there are three lines, all of them have 8A. But the loads are balanced, so their phase currents should be balanced as well.

Wait, but each load is balanced, so for each load, all three phases have the same current. So for the first load, each phase draws I1, and for the second load, each phase draws I2. Now, each line is the sum of the phase currents from each load on that line. So line current = I1 + I2.

Since the system is balanced, all three line currents are equal to 8A. So I1 + I2 = 8A for each line.

But since each load is balanced, the sum of the phase currents for each load must be equal across all three lines. Wait, but each line is carrying the sum of the phase currents from both loads. So for each line, the current is I1 + I2 = 8A.

But for each load, since they are Y-connected, the phase currents are balanced. So each load's phase current is the same across all three phases.

Wait, so for the first load, each phase has I1, and for the second load, each phase has I2. But each line is the sum of one phase from each load. So line current = I1 + I2 = 8A.

But since all three lines are the same, and the loads are balanced, I1 and I2 must be such that I1 + I2 = 8A for each line.

But wait, each load's phase current is I1 and I2 respectively. Now, to find I1 and I2, I can use the power and power factor for each load.

Let me start with the first load: 6kW at 0.8 lagging PF.

Power P1 = 6000 W.

For a Y-connected load, the power can be expressed as:

P = √3 * V_L * I * cosφ

Where V_L is the line voltage, I is the phase current (which is I1 for the first load), and φ is the power factor angle.

Similarly, for the second load, P2 = 12,000 W at 0.833 leading PF.

So, for the first load:

6000 = √3 * V_L * I1 * 0.8

For the second load:

12000 = √3 * V_L * I2 * (0.833)

Wait, but I don't know V_L yet. Hmm, perhaps I can find V_L using the line current and the phase current.

Wait, in a Y-connected load, the phase current Iph is related to the line current. But in a three-phase system, each line carries the current of one phase. Wait, no, because in a Y connection, each line is connected to one phase of each load. So each line has the sum of the phase currents from both loads on that line.

Wait, but for a Y-connected load, the line current is equal to the phase current only if it's a single load. But here, two loads are connected in parallel on each line.

Wait, perhaps I should model the entire system as two Y-connected loads in parallel. So each line carries the sum of the phase currents from each load.

So for each line, the current is I1 + I2, which is given as 8A.

But wait, each load has three phases, so each line has two phase currents: one from the first load and one from the second load. So the line current is I1 + I2 = 8A.

But since the system is balanced, all three line currents are 8A, and all three I1 and I2 must be such that I1 + I2 = 8A for each line.

Now, let's find I1 and I2 using the power and power factor.

The first load: 6kW at 0.8 PF lagging.

So for the first load:

P1 = √3 * V_L * I1 * cosφ1 = 6000
cosφ1 = 0.8, so φ1 = arccos(0.8) ≈ 36.87 degrees (but since it's lagging, it's positive).

Similarly, the second load: P2 = √3 * V_L * I2 * cosφ2 = 12000
cosφ2 = 0.833, which is approximately 33.69 degrees (leading, so negative angle).

But since both loads are connected to the same line voltage V_L, their V_L is the same.

So we have two equations:

√3 * V_L * I1 * 0.8 = 6000 --> equation 1
√3 * V_L * I2 * (0.833) = 12000 --> equation 2

We can divide equation 2 by equation 1 to eliminate V_L.

(√3 V_L I2 * 0.833) / (√3 V_L I1 * 0.8) ) = 12000 / 6000
Simplify: (I2 * 0.833) / (I1 * 0.8) ) = 2
So (I2 * 0.833) = 2 * I1 * 0.8
I2 = (2 * 0.8 / 0.833) * I1
Calculate 2 * 0.8 = 1.6
1.6 / 0.833 ≈ 1.92

So I2 ≈ 1.92 * I1.

But from the line current: I1 + I2 = 8A.

Substituting I2 = 1.92 I1 into I1 + 1.92 I1 = 8A:
I1 (1 + 1.92) =8
I1 * 2.92 = 8
I1 ≈ 8 / 2.92 ≈ 2.739 A

Then I2 = 8 - I1 ≈ 8 - 2.739 ≈ 5.261 A

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them have 2.739 A for the first load. Let me check my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio. Let me recalculate the ratio.

From equation 2 / equation 1:

( I2 * 0.833 ) / ( I1 * 0.8 ) ) = 2

So I2 / I1 = (2 * 0.8) / 0.833 = (1.6) / 0.833 ≈ 1.92.

Yes, that's correct.

So I1 ≈ 2.739 A, I2 ≈ 5.261 A.

But looking at the options, option I is First load current: 3.273A, Second load current:6.288A, Source phase current:8A.

Hmm, that's not matching my calculation. Maybe I messed up the approach.

Wait, another approach: since each line current is 8A, and each line is the sum of the two phase currents from each load, perhaps the phase currents for each load are the same across all three lines. So for each line, I1 + I2 = 8A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find the total power for each load and then find the phase current.

Wait, perhaps using the formula for power in a three-phase system: P = √3 * V_L * I * cosφ.

Let me try solving for V_L for each load.

For the first load:

6000 = √3 * V_L * I1 * 0.8 → V_L = 6000 / (√3 * I1 * 0.8)

For the second load:

12000 = √3 * V_L * I2 * 0.833 → V_L = 12000 / (√3 * I2 * 0.833)

Since both equal V_L, set them equal:

6000 / (√3 * I1 * 0.8) = 12000 / (√3 * I2 * 0.833)

Simplify: (6000) / (I1 * 0.8) = (12000) / (I2 * 0.833)

Multiply both sides by I1 * 0.8 * I2 * 0.833:

6000 * I2 * 0.833 = 12000 * I1 * 0.8

Divide both sides by 6000:

I2 * 0.833 = 2 * I1 * 0.8 → same as before.

So I2 = (2 * 0.8 / 0.833) * I1 ≈ 1.92 * I1.

Now, from the line current: I1 + I2 = 8.

Substituting I2 = 1.92 I1:

I1 (1 + 1.92) = 8 → I1 = 8/2.92 ≈ 2.739 A.

So I1 ≈ 2.739 A, I2 ≈ 5.261 A.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of the options have the first load current around 2.74 A. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 3.464, 5.774, 8.1

B: 3.273,6.288,7

C:2.8,6,7.5

D:4.5,5.3,8.5

E:3,7.071,8.2

F:5,7.071,9

G:3.873,6.708,7.8

H:2.5,5.3,8

I:3.273,6.288,8

J:4,6.288,8.

Hmm, none of these match I1 ≈ 2.739 A. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the line current is the vector sum of the two phase currents, not the algebraic sum. Because in a three-phase system, the currents are 120 degrees apart, so their vector sum would be different.

Wait, that's a possibility. So each line current is the vector sum of the two phase currents from each load. But since the loads have different power factors, their phase currents may have different phase angles, so the line current would be the phasor sum.

Wait, that complicates things. Let's think again.

The two loads are connected in parallel, each with their own phase currents. Each load's phase currents are in phase with each other because they're balanced. But the two loads have different power factors, so their phase angles are different.

So for each line, the current is the sum of the phase currents from each load, but with a phase difference between them.

Wait, but in a three-wire system, each line is a single conductor, so the current in each line is the sum of the phase currents from each load on that line.

But perhaps I should model each load's phase current as a phasor and sum them vectorially.

But this might get complicated. Let's try.

The first load (Load 1) has a power factor of 0.8 lagging, so its phase current lags the line voltage by φ1 = cos⁻¹(0.8) ≈ 36.87 degrees.

The second load (Load 2) has a power factor of 0.833 leading, so its phase current leads the line voltage by φ2 = cos⁻¹(0.833) ≈ 33.69 degrees. Wait, but 0.833 is approximately 5/6, so the angle is cos⁻¹(5/6) ≈ 33.56 degrees.

But since Load 2 is leading, the phase angle is negative, so -33.56 degrees.

Now, the line current in each line is the sum of the phase currents from Load 1 and Load 2, but each phase current is in a different phase.

Wait, but each line in the three-phase system is 120 degrees apart. So for Line 1, the phase current from Load 1 is I1∠φ1, and from Load 2 is I2∠φ2. But wait, no, because each load is connected to all three lines, so for each line, the phase current of Load 1 is I1∠(-φ1), because the line voltage is in a certain phase. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting too tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use complex numbers to represent the currents and sum them vectorially.

Let me denote the line voltage as V_L (same for all lines, as it's a balanced system).

The impedance of each phase of Load 1 is Z1 = V_L / I1, and the impedance of each phase of Load 2 is Z2 = V_L / I2.

But since both loads are Y-connected, their line voltages are the same, so V_L is the same for both.

But perhaps it's better to express each current as a phasor.

Assume the line voltage for Load 1 is V_L ∠0°, so the phase current I1 will be I1 ∠(-φ1), since it's lagging.

Similarly, for Load 2, the line voltage is also V_L ∠0°, and the phase current I2 will be I2 ∠φ2, since it's leading.

But wait, each line in the three-phase system is 120 degrees apart. So for Line 1, the voltage is V_L ∠0°, Line 2 is V_L ∠120°, and Line 3 is V_L ∠240°.

Each load is connected across all three lines, so for Load 1, the phase currents will be I1, I1, I1, each lagging by φ1.

Similarly, for Load 2, the phase currents will be I2, I2, I2, each leading by φ2.

But wait, that can't be right because each phase of a Y-connected load has the same current, but in this case, two different loads are connected, so their phase currents would add up on each line.

Wait, perhaps I should model each line's current as the sum of the two phase currents from each load.

So for Line 1 (V_L ∠0°), the current is I1∠(-φ1) + I2∠φ2.

Similarly, Line 2 (V_L ∠120°): I1∠(-φ1 + 120°) + I2∠(φ2 + 120°).

Line 3 (V_L ∠240°): I1∠(-φ1 + 240°) + I2∠(φ2 + 240°).

But the line currents are given as 8A each, so the magnitude of each line current is 8A.

So |I1∠(-φ1) + I2∠φ2| = 8A.

Similarly for the other lines.

But this seems complicated, but perhaps manageable.

We can write the magnitude equation:

|I1 e^{-jφ1} + I2 e^{jφ2}| = 8.

Similarly, for the other lines, but since the system is balanced, all three line currents have the same magnitude.

But this seems a bit involved. Let's try to compute the magnitude.

Let me compute the phase difference between the two phase currents in Line 1.

The phase of I1 is -φ1 = -36.87°, and the phase of I2 is φ2 = 33.56°, so the angle between them is (-36.87) - (33.56) = -70.43 degrees.

So the angle between the two currents is 70.43 degrees.

Then, the magnitude squared of the sum is:

I1² + I2² + 2 I1 I2 cos(70.43°) = 8² = 64.

So equation:

I1² + I2² + 2 I1 I2 cos(70.43°) = 64.

We also have from the power equations:

From Load 1: 6000 = √3 * V_L * I1 * 0.8 → V_L = 6000 / (√3 I1 * 0.8) = (6000 * 1.25) / (√3 I1) = 7500 / (√3 I1).

From Load 2: 12000 = √3 * V_L * I2 * 0.833 → V_L = 12000 / (√3 I2 * 0.833) ≈ 12000 / (√3 I2 * 0.833) ≈ 12000 / (√3 I2 * 0.833) ≈ 12000 * 1.2 / (√3 I2) → since 1/0.833 ≈ 1.2.

Wait, 1/0.833 is approximately 1.2, yes. So V_L ≈ (12000 * 1.2) / (√3 I2) = 14400 / (√3 I2).

But since both expressions equal V_L, set them equal:

7500 / (√3 I1) = 14400 / (√3 I2)

Simplify: 7500 / I1 = 14400 / I2 → I2 = (14400 / 7500) * I1 → I2 = (1.92) I1.

So I2 = 1.92 I1.

Now, we can substitute I2 into the magnitude equation:

I1² + (1.92 I1)^2 + 2 * I1 * 1.92 I1 * cos(70.43°) = 64.

Calculate each term:

I1² + (3.6864 I1²) + (3.84 I1²) * cos(70.43°) = 64.

Compute cos(70.43°) ≈ 0.3420.

So:

I1² (1 + 3.6864 + 3.84 * 0.3420) = 64.

Calculate the coefficients:

1 + 3.6864 = 4.6864.

3.84 * 0.3420 ≈ 1.312.

So total coefficient: 4.6864 + 1.312 ≈ 6.0.

So 6 I1² = 64 → I1² = 64 /6 ≈ 10.6667 → I1 ≈ sqrt(10.6667) ≈ 3.266 A.

So I1 ≈ 3.266 A, and I2 = 1.92 * 3.266 ≈ 6.288 A.

Hmm, looking at the options, let's check option I: First load current: 3.273A, Second load current:6.288A, Source phase current:8A.

That's very close to my calculation. So part (a) would be approximately 3.273 A, part (b) 6.288 A.

Now, for part (c), the source phase current. Wait, in a three-phase system, the source phase current is the same as the line current, right? Because each phase of the source is connected to a line, and the current in the line is the phase current.

Wait, but in this case, each line is carrying 8A, which is the sum of the two phase currents from each load on that line. But the source phase current is the same as the line current because each line is connected directly to the source's phase. So the source phase current is 8A.

Wait, but in the options, option I has source phase current as 8A. So the correct option would be I: First load: 3.273, Second:6.288, Source:8A.

Wait, but earlier, I thought I1 was around 3.266, which rounds to 3.273, and I2 is 6.288. So yes, option I matches.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the two Y-connected loads in a balanced three-phase three-wire system where each line carries 8A RMS. The first load draws 6kW at 0.8 PF lagging, and the second requires 12kW at 0.833 PF leading. 

### Step 1: Power and Power Factor Analysis
For the first load:
\[
P_1 = 6000 = \sqrt{3} \cdot V_L \cdot I_1 \cdot 0.8
\]
For the second load:
\[
P_2 = 12000 = \sqrt{3} \cdot V_L \cdot I_2 \cdot 0.833
\]
Equating the expressions for \( V_L \) from both loads:
\[
\frac{6000}{\sqrt{3} \cdot I_1 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{12000}{\sqrt{3} \cdot I_2 \cdot 0.833}
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\frac{6000}{I_1 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{12000}{I_2 \cdot 0.833}
\]
\[
\frac{6000 \cdot 0.833}{I_1 \cdot 0.8} = 12000
\]
\[
\frac{5}{I_1} = 12000 \cdot 0.8 / 6000
\]
\[
I_2 = 1.92 \cdot I_1
\]

### Step 2: Line Current Analysis
Each line carries the sum of the phase currents from both loads:
\[
I_1 + I_2 = 8
\]
Substituting \( I_2 = 1.92 \cdot I_1 \):
\[
I_1 + 1.92 \cdot I_1 = 8
\]
\[
2.92 \cdot I_1 = 8
\]
\[
I_1 \approx 2.739 \, \text{A}
\]
\[
I_2 \approx 5.261 \, \text{A}
\]

### Step 3: Vector Sum of Currents
Considering the phase angles due to different power factors, the magnitude of the line current is:
\[
|I_1 e^{-j\phi_1} + I_2 e^{j\phi_2}| = 8
\]
Using the magnitudes:
\[
I_1 \approx 3.273 \, \text{A}, \quad I_2 \approx 6.288 \, \text{A}
\]

### Step 4: Source Phase Current
In a balanced three-phase system, the source phase current is equal to the line current, which is 8A.

### Final Answer
The correct option is:
- First load current: \( 3.273 \, \text{A} \)
- Second load current: \( 6.288 \, \text{A} \)
- Source phase current: \( 8 \, \text{A} \)
