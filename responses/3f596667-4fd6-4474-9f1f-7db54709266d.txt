Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about mixing ice and Omni-Cola to reach a certain temperature. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on thermodynamics, but let's try to break it down.

Alright, the problem says there's a glass with 0.25 kg of Omni-Cola, which is mostly water, initially at 25°C. We need to add ice at -20°C so that the final temperature is 0°C, and all the ice melts. The glass's heat capacity is negligible, so we don't have to worry about that. Our goal is to find out how much ice in grams we need to add. The options are from A to J, with various grams.

First, I remember that when dealing with heat transfer, the heat lost by the hotter substance should equal the heat gained by the colder one, assuming no heat loss to the surroundings. So the cola will lose heat, and the ice will gain heat to warm up and melt.

The process involves a few steps for the ice:
1. Heating the ice from -20°C to 0°C. For this, we use the formula Q = m * c * ΔT, where c is the specific heat of ice.
2. Melting the ice at 0°C, which requires the latent heat of fusion. Q = m * L, where L is the latent heat.

The cola, on the other hand, will cool down from 25°C to 0°C. Its heat loss is Q = m * c * ΔT, where c is the specific heat of water.

I need to find the mass of the ice (let's call it m_ice) such that the heat lost by the cola equals the heat gained by the ice in both warming up and melting.

Let me jot down the formulas:

Heat lost by cola:
Q_cola = m_cola * c_water * (T_initial_cola - T_final)
m_cola is 0.25 kg, which is 250 grams. Wait, no, wait—wait, the mass is in kg, right? 0.25 kg is 250 grams, yes. So m_cola = 250 g.

c_water is 4.184 J/(g°C), but sometimes it's approximated as 4.186 or 4.2. I'll use 4.184 for accuracy.

T_initial_cola = 25°C, T_final = 0°C, so ΔT is 25°C.

So Q_cola = 250 g * 4.184 J/g°C * 25°C.

Now, the heat gained by the ice has two parts: warming up and melting.

First part: heating ice from -20 to 0°C:
Q1_ice = m_ice * c_ice * ΔT_ice
c_ice is about 2.09 J/(g°C), and ΔT_ice is 20°C (from -20 to 0).

Second part: melting the ice:
Q2_ice = m_ice * L_fusion
L_fusion for water is 334 J/g.

So total heat gained by ice is Q_ice = Q1_ice + Q2_ice = m_ice*(c_ice*20 + L_fusion).

Since the heat lost by cola equals the heat gained by ice, we set Q_cola = Q_ice.

So:

250 * 4.184 * 25 = m_ice * (2.09 * 20 + 334)

Let me calculate each part step by step.

First, calculate Q_cola:
250 * 4.184 = let's see, 250 * 4 is 1000, 250 * 0.184 = 46. So 1000 + 46 = 1046. Then multiply by 25. 1046 * 25 = let's compute that. 1000*25=25,000, 46*25=1,150. So total Q_cola = 25,000 + 1,150 = 26,150 J.

Now, the right side: m_ice*(2.09*20 + 334) = m_ice*(41.8 + 334) = m_ice*375.8 J/g.

So we have:

26,150 J = m_ice * 375.8 J/g

Solve for m_ice:

m_ice = 26,150 / 375.8 ≈ let's compute that.

Dividing 26150 by 375.8. Let's approximate.

375.8 * 70 = 26,306 (since 375*70=26,250, and 0.8*70=56, so sum 26,306). Oh, wait, 375.8 *70=375.8*7*10=2630.6*10=26306.

But 26,150 is a bit less than 26,306, so maybe 69.8 or so.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately.

26150 divided by 375.8.

Let me compute 375.8 * 69 = ?

375 *70 =26,250, but since it's 69, it's 375 *69 = 375*(70-1) = 26,250 -375=25,875.

Then 0.8 *69=55.2, so total for 375.8 *69=25,875 +55.2=25,930.2.

We have 26,150 - 25,930.2 = 219.8 left.

Now, 375.8 * x = 219.8 → x ≈ 219.8 /375.8 ≈ 0.585.

So total m_ice ≈69.585 grams. So approximately 69.6 grams.

Looking at the options, option C is 70 grams, which is very close. So the answer should be C:70.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, Q_cola: 250g *4.184 J/g°C *25°C.

250 *4.184 = 1046 J/°C, times 25 gives 26,150 J. That's correct.

For the ice, the total per gram is (2.09*20) +334 =41.8 +334=375.8 J/g. Yes.

So 26150 /375.8 ≈69.58 grams. So 70 grams is option C. That makes sense.

To solve the problem, we calculate the heat lost by the Omni-Cola and the heat gained by the ice, ensuring they are equal. The heat lost by the cola is given by:

\[
Q_{\text{cola}} = m_{\text{cola}} \cdot c_{\text{water}} \cdot \Delta T_{\text{cola}}
\]

where \( m_{\text{cola}} = 0.25 \, \text{kg} = 250 \, \text{g} \), \( c_{\text{water}} = 4.184 \, \text{J/g°C} \), and \( \Delta T_{\text{cola}} = 25 \, \text{°C} \). This gives:

\[
Q_{\text{cola}} = 250 \cdot 4.184 \cdot 25 = 26,150 \, \text{J}
\]

The heat gained by the ice involves two steps: warming the ice from \(-20 \, \text{°C}\) to \(0 \, \text{°C}\) and melting it. The heat required for warming is:

\[
Q_{\text{ice, warm}} = m_{\text{ice}} \cdot c_{\text{ice}} \cdot \Delta T_{\text{ice}}
\]

where \( c_{\text{ice}} = 2.09 \, \text{J/g°C} \) and \( \Delta T_{\text{ice}} = 20 \, \text{°C} \). The heat required for melting is:

\[
Q_{\text{ice, melt}} = m_{\text{ice}} \cdot L_{\text{fusion}}
\]

where \( L_{\text{fusion}} = 334 \, \text{J/g} \). The total heat gained by the ice is:

\[
Q_{\text{ice}} = m_{\text{ice}} \cdot (c_{\text{ice}} \cdot \Delta T_{\text{ice}} + L_{\text{fusion}})
\]

Equating \( Q_{\text{cola}} \) and \( Q_{\text{ice}} \):

\[
26,150 = m_{\text{ice}} \cdot (2.09 \cdot 20 + 334) = m_{\text{ice}} \cdot 375.8
\]

Solving for \( m_{\text{ice}} \):

\[
m_{\text{ice}} = \frac{26,150}{375.8} \approx 69.6 \, \text{g}
\]

Rounding to the nearest option, the required mass of ice is approximately **70 grams**.
