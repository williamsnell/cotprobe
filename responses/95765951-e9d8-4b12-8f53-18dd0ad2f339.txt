Question:

A longshoreman fell to his death through an open hatch on the deck of a ship. The longshoreman was an employee of a company that had contracted with the ship's owner to load and unload the ship. The fall occurred at night, when loading work was over for the day, and there was no reason for the longshoreman to have been near the hatch. A negligence action was filed against the ship's owner for the death of the longshoreman. In that action, the owner has moved for summary judgment and has provided unrebutted evidence that it is customary for the crews of ships to open the hatches for ventilation after the longshoremen have left the ships. How should the court respond to the motion?

Options:

A: Deny the motion and submit the case to the jury with instructions that the ship's owner is liable if the hatch was left open irresponsibly.
B: Grant the motion, because the custom should be considered conclusive on the issue of negligence.
C: Grant the motion, because it is customary for the crews to open the hatches for ventilation after the longshoremen have left the ship.
D: Deny the motion and submit the case to the jury with instructions that the ship's owner should win if the longshoreman was improperly near the hatch.
E: Deny the motion, because the probability of serious injury caused by falling down an open hatch clearly outweighs the burden of keeping the hatch closed.
F: Grant the motion, as the longshoreman was an employee of a different company and the ship's owner can't be held responsible for his whereabouts.
G: Deny the motion, because the ship's owner should have ensured that all hatches were closed after the longshoremen had left the ship.
H: Grant the motion, because there was no reason for the longshoreman to have been near the hatch.
I: Deny the motion and submit the case to the jury with instructions that the custom is relevant but not conclusive on the issue of negligence.
J: Deny the motion and submit the case to the jury with instructions that the custom is irrelevant to the issue of negligence.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about negligence and whether the court should grant summary judgment. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: A longshoreman died by falling through an open hatch on a ship. He was an employee of a company that contracted with the ship's owner for loading and unloading. The incident happened at night after work was over, so there was no reason for him to be near the hatch. The ship's owner is being sued for negligence, and they moved for summary judgment, providing evidence that it's customary for the ship's crew to open hatches for ventilation after the longshoremen leave.

I need to determine how the court should respond. The options are from A to J, each suggesting a different outcome.

Understanding the basics of negligence: To prove negligence, the plaintiff must show that the defendant owed a duty of care, breached that duty, causing injury, and resulting in damages. A motion for summary judgment is granted when there's no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

The defendant here (ship's owner) is arguing that it's customary for the crew to open hatches after the longshoremen leave. So, they're likely trying to show that their action (or inaction) was in line with industry standards, possibly as a defense against negligence.

In some cases, custom can be evidence of the standard of care, but it doesn't automatically absolve liability. Courts often consider custom as part of the duty of care but don't treat it as conclusive. For example, if the defendant can show that their actions conformed to a recognized custom, it might support their argument that they didn't breach the duty. However, the plaintiff could counter that the custom is not reasonable or that the defendant should have taken additional precautions.

Looking at the options:

Option B says to grant the motion because the custom is conclusive. That seems too strong because custom isn't always binding; it's just one factor in determining the standard of care.

Option C grants the motion because the custom exists. But again, the existence of a custom doesn't automatically mean the defendant didn't breach a duty. It's up to the court to decide if following the custom was reasonable.

Option I says to deny the motion and instruct the jury that custom is relevant but not conclusive. That makes sense because the jury should weigh the custom as part of the evidence but isn't required to follow it blindly.

Option J says custom is irrelevant, which might not be correct because custom is often relevant in establishing the standard of care in negligence cases.

Option H suggests granting because there was no reason for the longshoreman to be near the hatch. But the question states that the longshoreman was an employee, so maybe the duty is to ensure safety even if there's no apparent reason, especially if the area should have been secure after work hours.

Option E talks about the probability of injury outweighing the burden of closing hatches. That seems more like a policy consideration, which might not directly apply here.

Option A and D talk about submitting to the jury with instructions on liability. A says the owner is liable if the hatch was left open irresponsibly. D says the owner wins if the longshoreman was improperly near. But whether the owner is liable depends on whether they breached their duty, which a jury should decide.

Option F says the owner isn't responsible because the longshoreman was from a different company. But the ship owner contracted with the longshoreman's company, so they might have a duty to provide a safe working environment.

So, putting it together: The ship owner provided evidence of a custom, but the plaintiff can argue that the custom is not reasonable or that the duty required more. The court shouldn't decide on summary judgment just based on the existence of a custom. Therefore, the motion should be denied, and the case should go to the jury with instructions that custom is relevant but not conclusive.

Looking back at the options, that's option I.

The court should deny the motion for summary judgment because while the custom is relevant, it is not conclusive. The jury should decide whether the custom meets the standard of care required.
