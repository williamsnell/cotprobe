Question:

Chromosomal sex in mammals has been shown to be strongly Y chromosome determined. How was this shown to be true?

Options:

A: The absence of a Y chromosome determines maleness in mammals
B: The presence of a Y chromosome usually determines maleness in mammals
C: The ratio of two X chromosomes to one Y chromosome determines maleness
D: The presence of an X chromosome determines maleness in mammals
E: The presence of an X chromosome in the absence of a Y chromosome determines maleness
F: The presence of a Y chromosome determines femaleness in mammals
G: The presence of a Y chromosome has no impact on the determination of maleness
H: The presence of multiple X chromosomes without a Y chromosome determines maleness
I: The presence of two or more Y chromosomes is required for maleness
J: The presence of an X chromosome determines femaleness in mammals

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about chromosomal sex determination in mammals. The question is asking how it was shown that chromosomal sex is Y chromosome determined. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that in mammals, sex determination is typically linked to the presence of the Y chromosome. I think that females usually have two X chromosomes (XX), and males have one X and one Y (XY). So, the presence of a Y chromosome is what makes an organism male.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the absence of a Y determines maleness. Wait, that doesn't make sense because without a Y, you'd have two Xs, which is female. So A is incorrect.

Option B states that the presence of a Y usually determines maleness. That aligns with what I remember. Males have the Y, so B seems correct.

Option C talks about the ratio of two Xs to one Y. I don't think that's right because having two Xs and one Y (like in XXY) would still typically result in a male, but that's a rare condition. The main point is the presence of Y, not the ratio.

Option D suggests the presence of X determines maleness. No, because females have two Xs and are not male. So D is wrong.

Option E says X without Y determines maleness. That's not right because without Y, you're female (XX). So E is incorrect.

Option F claims Y determines femaleness. No, Y is for males. Females are XX, so F is wrong.

Option G says Y has no impact. That's opposite of what I know; Y is crucial for maleness. So G is wrong.

Option H mentions multiple Xs without Y. That would be like XXX, which is female, so H is incorrect.

Option I says you need multiple Ys. I don't think so; typically, one Y is enough. So I is wrong.

Option J says X determines femaleness. Well, that's partially true because females have two Xs, but the presence of X alone doesn't determine it; the absence of Y does. Still, J is focusing on X determining femaleness, which is correct but doesn't directly answer how Y determines maleness.

Wait, the question is about how it was shown that Y determines maleness. So the presence of Y leads to maleness. So the correct answer should be B.
