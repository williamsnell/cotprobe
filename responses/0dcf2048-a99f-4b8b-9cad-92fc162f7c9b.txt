Okay, let's see. PaulineDiNardi is trying to decide where to buy a stereo set. She has two options: New Jersey and New York. The price in New Jersey is $698.50. In New York, the price is $684.75, but she has to add a 4% state tax and a 2% city tax. I need to figure out which option is cheaper after considering all taxes.

First, I should calculate the total cost in New York. The base price is $684.75. The state tax is 4%, so I'll calculate 4% of 684.75. Let me do that: 684.75 * 0.04 = 27.39. Then there's a 2% city tax on the same amount, so 684.75 * 0.02 = 13.695. Now, add those two taxes together: 27.39 + 13.695 = 41.085. 

So the total cost in New York would be the base price plus the taxes. That's 684.75 + 41.085 = 725.835, which I can round to $725.84. 

Now, comparing the two options: New Jersey is $698.50, and New York is $725.84. So New Jersey is cheaper. 

Looking at the options, option D says she should buy the New Jersey stereo. But wait, is there any other factors? The question doesn't mention any other costs like travel expenses, so I don't need to consider that. Also, none of the options mention additional factors like discounts or rebates. 

So the correct answer should be D: The New Jersey stereo.

The New York stereo costs $725.84 after taxes, which is more than the New Jersey price of $698.50. Therefore, the New Jersey stereo is cheaper.

Answer: D
