Question:

In Jules Verne's 1865 story with this title, three men went to the moon in a shell fired from a giant cannon sunk in the earth in Florida. Find the minimum muzzle speed that would allow a shell to escape from the earth completely (the escape speed). Neglect air resistance, the earth's rotation, and the gravitational pull of the moon. The earth's radius and mass are $R_E}=$ $6.38 \times 10^6 m$ and $m_E=5.97 \times 10^{24} kg$. (Unit: 10 ^ 4 m/s)

Options:

A: 1.57
B: 1.03
C: 1.12
D: 2.72
E: 0.98
F: 0.86
G: 2.38
H: 2.00
I: 1.84
J: 2.15

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about Jules Verne's story where three men go to the moon using a cannon. The question is asking for the minimum muzzle speed required for a shell to escape Earth's gravity completely. I need to find the escape speed and then choose the correct option from A to J. 

Hmm, I remember that escape velocity is the speed needed for an object to break free from a planet's gravitational pull without any additional propulsion. The formula for escape velocity is derived from the conservation of energy, right? So the kinetic energy at the surface should equal the gravitational potential energy at infinity.

The formula I think is v = sqrt(2 * G * M / R), where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the Earth, and R is the radius of the Earth. Let me jot that down.

Wait, what's the value of G? I think it's approximately 6.674×10^-11 N·m²/kg². And the Earth's mass, M, is given as 5.97×10^24 kg, and the radius R is 6.38×10^6 meters. The problem mentions the unit is 10^4 m/s, so I should calculate the velocity and then express it in terms of 10^4.

Let me plug in the numbers. So, v = sqrt( (2 * G * M) / R ). Let's compute the numerator first: 2 * G * M. That would be 2 * 6.674e-11 * 5.97e24. Let me calculate that.

2 * 6.674e-11 is about 1.3348e-10. Multiply that by 5.97e24: 1.3348e-10 * 5.97e24 = let's see. 1.3348 *5.97 is roughly 8.0, and 10^-10 * 10^24 is 10^14. So 8.0e14? Wait, maybe I should be more precise.

Wait, 6.674 × 2 = 13.348, so 13.348e-11. Then 13.348e-11 * 5.97e24: 13.348 *5.97 ≈ 81.63, and 10^-11 *10^24 is 10^13. So 81.63e13 = 8.163e14.

Then, divide by R, which is 6.38e6 meters. So 8.163e14 / 6.38e6 = let's compute that. 8.163 /6.38 is approximately 1.28, and 1e14 /1e6 is 1e8. So 1.28e8 m²/s².

Wait, that's the value inside the square root, so v = sqrt(1.28e8). Let me compute the square root of 1.28e8. The square root of 1e8 is 1e4, which is 10,000 m/s. The square root of 1.28 is about 1.131. So 1.131 *1e4 = 11,310 m/s. But wait, the options are in units of 10^4 m/s, so it's 1.131 *1e4, which is 11.31 km/s. But looking at the options, they're given in 10^4 m/s, so the value would be approximately 11.31 /1e4? Wait, no, wait. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the options are labeled with "Unit: 10^4 m/s", meaning the answer should be in terms of 10^4 m/s. So if the escape speed is approximately 11,300 m/s, that's 1.13 *10^4 m/s. So looking at the options, option C is 1.12, which is close to 1.13. Option D is 2.72, which is much higher. Option I is 1.84, which is higher than 1.13. Option H is 2.00, which is higher. Hmm, but wait, perhaps my calculation was a bit off.

Wait, let me double-check the numbers. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me recalculate the numerator precisely.

G is 6.674e-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2. M is 5.97e24 kg. So 2*G*M = 2 * 6.674e-11 * 5.97e24.

Calculating 6.674e-11 *5.97e24: 6.674 *5.97 is approximately 39.86, and 1e-11 *1e24 is 1e13. So 39.86e13 = 3.986e14. Multiply by 2: 7.972e14.

Now, divide by R, which is 6.38e6 m. So 7.972e14 /6.38e6 = 7.972 /6.38 = approximately 1.25, and 1e14/1e6=1e8. So 1.25e8 m²/s². Now, taking the square root of 1.25e8.

The square root of 1e8 is 1e4 (10,000 m/s). The square root of 1.25 is about 1.118. So 1.118 *1e4 = 11,180 m/s. Expressed as 1.118e4 m/s, which is 11.18 km/s. So in terms of 10^4 m/s, it's 1.118. Looking at the options, option C is 1.12, which is very close. So the correct answer should be C:1.12.

Wait, but sometimes the exact value is taken as 11.2 km/s, so that would fit. So the minimum muzzle speed is the escape velocity, which is approximately 11.2 km/s, so 1.12 ×10^4 m/s. Therefore, the correct option is C.
</think>

The minimum muzzle speed required for a shell to escape Earth's gravity is the escape velocity, calculated using the formula \( v = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}} \). Plugging in the given values for Earth's mass and radius, the escape velocity is approximately \( 11.2 \, \text{km/s} \), or \( 1.12 \times 10^4 \, \text{m/s} \).
