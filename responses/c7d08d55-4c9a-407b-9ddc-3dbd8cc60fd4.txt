Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a rocket, and I'm supposed to figure out how long it takes for the rocket to lift off after firing its engines. And also, I need to find out what's wrong with the design. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, the problem gives me some numbers: the rocket's initial mass is 70,000 kg, it burns fuel at 250 kg/s, and the exhaust velocity is 2500 m/s. The rocket is starting from rest on Earth, and we're looking for the time until it lifts off. I think lifting off happens when the rocket's thrust overcomes the gravitational force holding it down. So, the key here is to calculate the thrust and see when that equals the weight of the rocket.

Wait, but I remember that the thrust of a rocket is given by the equation F = m_dot * v_e. Yeah, that's right. m_dot is the mass flow rate, and v_e is the exhaust velocity. So, thrust F is 250 kg/s multiplied by 2500 m/s. Let me calculate that: 250 * 2500 = 625,000 N. So the thrust is 625,000 Newtons.

Now, the gravitational force acting on the rocket is its weight, which is mass times gravity. The initial mass is 70,000 kg, and g is approximately 9.81 m/s². So, weight W = 70,000 * 9.81. Let me do that math: 70,000 * 9.81 = 686,700 N. So the weight is 686,700 N.

Wait a minute, the thrust is 625,000 N, and the weight is 686,700 N. That means the thrust is less than the weight. Oh, so the rocket won't lift off because the thrust isn't enough to overcome gravity. So, the rocket is underpowered, which is a design flaw.

But wait, the question is asking how long after firing will the rocket lift off. Wait, if the thrust is less than the weight, the rocket can't lift off at all. So does that mean it never does lift off? But that can't be right because the options are all times, so maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should consider the changing mass of the rocket as it burns fuel. The initial mass is 70,000 kg, but as it burns fuel, the mass decreases, so the required thrust to lift off (which is equal to weight) also decreases. So maybe at some point, the thrust will equal the weight as the mass decreases.

Ah, that makes sense. So as the rocket loses mass, its weight decreases, and when the thrust equals the weight, it will lift off. So the time to lift off is when the thrust equals the weight at that moment.

Let me set up the equation. At time t, the mass of the rocket is m(t) = m_initial - m_dot * t. The weight at that time is m(t) * g. The thrust is F = m_dot * v_e. For the rocket to lift off, F = m(t) * g.

So:

m_dot * v_e = (m_initial - m_dot * t) * g

Solving for t:

m_dot * v_e = m_initial * g - m_dot * g * t

Let's rearrange terms:

m_dot * g * t = m_initial * g - m_dot * v_e

t = [m_initial * g - m_dot * v_e] / (m_dot * g)

Wait, but let me plug in the numbers:

m_initial = 70,000 kg
m_dot = 250 kg/s
v_e = 2500 m/s
g = 9.81 m/s²

So,

t = [70000 * 9.81 - 250 * 2500] / (250 * 9.81)

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute numerator:

70000 * 9.81 = 70,000 * 9.81 = 686,700 kg·m/s² (which is N)

250 * 2500 = 625,000 kg·m/s² (N)

So numerator is 686700 - 625000 = 61700 N.

Denominator is 250 * 9.81 = 2452.5 kg·m/s² (N)

So t = 61700 / 2452.5 ≈ let's calculate that.

Dividing 61700 by 2452.5:

Approximately, 2452.5 * 25 = 61312.5, which is close to 61700. So 25 seconds would give 25 * 2452.5 = 61312.5, which is just a bit less than 61700. The difference is 61700 -61312.5=387.5.

So 387.5 / 2452.5 ≈ 0.158 seconds. So total t ≈25.158 seconds, which is roughly 25 seconds.

Looking at the options, G is 25 seconds. So the time to lift off is about 25 seconds. But wait, earlier I thought the thrust was less than initial weight, but as mass decreases, the required weight to overcome decreases, so eventually, the thrust will match the weight, allowing lift-off.

So the rocket will lift off after about 25 seconds. But the question also asks what's wrong with the design. Well, the thrust at lift-off is exactly matching the weight, which is the minimum required. But in reality, rockets need a thrust greater than the weight to actually accelerate upwards. If the thrust is only equal to the weight, the rocket would just start moving, but without acceleration. So perhaps the design is flawed because the thrust isn't enough to provide any acceleration, making the ascent very slow or ineffective.

Wait, but in the initial calculation, the thrust is 625,000 N, and the initial weight is 686,700 N, which is less. So the thrust is less, but as the rocket loses mass, the weight decreases. At the time when m(t) = F_thrust / g, which is 625,000 /9.81 ≈ 63,714 kg. So the mass at that point would be 63,714 kg, which is 70,000 -250*t. So 70,000 -250 t = 63,714 → 250 t = 6,286 → t≈25.14 seconds, which matches our earlier calculation.

So the rocket will lift off after about 25 seconds, but the design is flawed because the initial thrust is less than the initial weight. So the rocket can only lift off once it has burned enough fuel to reduce its mass to where the weight equals the thrust. But if the rocket can't even lift off in the first place until it's already burned a significant amount of fuel, that's a problem. Alternatively, a better design would have a higher thrust or lower mass to ensure it lifts off immediately.

To determine when the rocket will lift off, we calculate the time it takes for the thrust to equal the rocket's weight as its mass decreases. The thrust is given by \( F = \dot{m} \cdot v_e = 250 \, \mathrm{kg/s} \cdot 2500 \, \mathrm{m/s} = 625,000 \, \mathrm{N} \). The initial weight is \( W = m_{\text{initial}} \cdot g = 70,000 \, \mathrm{kg} \cdot 9.81 \, \mathrm{m/s}^2 = 686,700 \, \mathrm{N} \). Since the thrust is less than the initial weight, the rocket cannot lift off immediately. However, as fuel is burned, the rocket's mass decreases, reducing its weight. Setting the thrust equal to the weight at time \( t \), we solve:

\[
\dot{m} \cdot v_e = (m_{\text{initial}} - \dot{m} \cdot t) \cdot g
\]

Rearranging:

\[
t = \frac{m_{\text{initial}} \cdot g - \dot{m} \cdot v_e}{\dot{m} \cdot g}
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
t = \frac{70,000 \cdot 9.81 - 250 \cdot 2500}{250 \cdot 9.81} \approx 25 \, \mathrm{s}
\]

Thus, the rocket will lift off after approximately 25 seconds. However, the design is flawed because the initial thrust is insufficient to overcome the rocket's weight, requiring significant fuel burn-off before lift-off.
