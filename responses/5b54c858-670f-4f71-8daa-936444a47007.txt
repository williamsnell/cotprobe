Okay, so I have this question about graph problems and whether certain pathfinding tasks can be solved in polynomial time. Let me try to think this through step by step.

The question is about two problems, P1 and P2. P1 is finding the shortest simple path between two vertices a and b in a connected, undirected graph. P2 is finding the longest simple path between the same two vertices.

I remember that in graph theory, a simple path means a path where each vertex is visited only once, right? So no cycles or repeated vertices.

First, let's tackle P1, the shortest path problem. I recall that the shortest path problem is well-known and has efficient algorithms for certain types of graphs. For example, in a graph with non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm can find the shortest path in O(M + N log N) time, where M is the number of edges and N is the number of vertices. Since the graph is connected and undirected, Dijkstra's applies here if the weights are non-negative. So P1 is definitely solvable in polynomial time. That means any option that says P1 is not solvable in polynomial time is incorrect. Looking at the options, options A, C, E, I say P1 isn't known to be solvable, but we know it is, so those can be eliminated.

Now, P2 is the longest simple path between two vertices. Longest path problems are trickier. I remember that finding the longest simple path in a graph is equivalent to finding the Hamiltonian path between two vertices. And the Hamiltonian path problem is known to be NP-Complete. NP-Complete means that, as far as we know, there's no polynomial-time algorithm for it, and if one exists, it would imply P=NP, which is a big unsolved question in computer science.

So since P2 is NP-Complete, it can't be solved in polynomial time unless P=NP, which is not known to be true. So for P2, we can't solve it in polynomial time unless there's some breakthrough, but currently, it's not possible. So any option that claims P2 can be solved in polynomial time is wrong. Looking at the options, options B, D, F, G, J suggest P2 can be solved in polynomial time, so those are out.

Wait, but I need to double-check. The question is about a connected undirected graph. Does that change anything? Well, the longest simple path is still the same problem, regardless of the graph being directed or undirected, in terms of complexity. So the conclusion remains.

So putting it together: P1 can be solved in polynomial time, and P2 cannot. So which option matches that?

Looking at the options again:

Option J says P1 can be solved, P2 cannot. So the correct answer should be J.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option J: P1 can be solved in polynomial time and P2 is known not to be solvable in polynomial time. Yes, that's correct.

So the answer should be J.

The question asks about the solvability of two graph problems, P1 and P2, in polynomial time. P1 involves finding the shortest simple path between two vertices, while P2 involves finding the longest simple path. 

For P1, the shortest path problem is well-known and can be efficiently solved using algorithms like Dijkstra's, which runs in polynomial time. Therefore, P1 is solvable in polynomial time.

For P2, the longest simple path problem is equivalent to finding a Hamiltonian path, which is NP-Complete. This means it is not known to have a polynomial-time solution, and solving it would imply P=NP, which remains unproven.

Thus, P1 can be solved in polynomial time, but P2 cannot. The correct answer is:

**J**
