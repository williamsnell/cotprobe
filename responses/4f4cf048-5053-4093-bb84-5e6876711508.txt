Okay, so I've got this question about the angular separation of a double star that can be resolved by the Mount Wilson reflecting telescope. The telescope has a mirror that's 100 inches in diameter. Hmm, I remember that the resolving power of a telescope depends on its aperture and the wavelength of light it's using. 

Wait, the formula for the resolving power... I think it's something like the diffraction limit. Oh right, the Rayleigh criterion. The formula is theta = 1.22 * lambda / D, where theta is the angular resolution in radians, lambda is the wavelength, and D is the diameter of the telescope's mirror.

But wait, I need to make sure about the units. The wavelength is usually in meters, and the diameter in meters too. Oh, but the mirror is 100 inches. I should convert that to meters. Let me think, 1 inch is 0.0254 meters, so 100 inches is 100 * 0.0254 = 2.54 meters. Right.

Now, what wavelength are we using? I suppose the question assumes visible light. The average wavelength for visible light is around 500 nm, which is 500 x 10^-9 meters. Wait, actually, the typical value used for such calculations is often 550 nm, but 500 is close enough. Let me stick with 500 nm for this.

So plugging the numbers into the formula: theta = 1.22 * (500e-9 m) / (2.54 m). Let me compute that. 500e-9 divided by 2.54 is approximately 1.968e-7. Multiply by 1.22 gives about 2.41e-7 radians.

But wait, the question asks for the answer in seconds of arc. Oh right, I need to convert radians to arcseconds. I remember that 1 radian is about 2.06265e5 arcseconds. So multiply theta in radians by that.

So 2.41e-7 radians * 2.06265e5 arcseconds/radian ≈ 2.41e-7 * 2.06265e5 = let's see, 2.41 * 2.06265 is around 5.0, and 1e-7 * 1e5 is 1e-2. So 5.0e-2 arcseconds. Wait, that gives 0.05 arcseconds. But looking at the options, none of them exactly match this. Wait, let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 2.41e-7 * 2.06265e5 = (2.41 * 2.06265) * (1e-7 * 1e5) = (approx 5.0) * 1e-2 = 0.05, so 5e-2. Looking at the options, option A is 5.5e-2, which is close. But wait, maybe I used the wrong wavelength. If I use 550 nm instead of 500, let's try that.

550e-9 m / 2.54 m = 550e-9 / 2.54 ≈ 2.165e-7. Multiply by 1.22: 1.22 * 2.165e-7 ≈ 2.63e-7 radians. Then, convert to arcseconds: 2.63e-7 * 2.06265e5 ≈ 2.63e-7 * 2.06e5 = approximately 5.42e-2, which is 0.0542 arcseconds. That's about 5.4e-2, which is close to option A, 5.5e-2. So maybe option A is the answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. I think the formula uses the diameter, which is correct. Another thing, sometimes the formula is written with D in the same units as lambda. But I think I did it correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the wavelength in inches? No, that doesn't make sense; the units should be in meters.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the conversion from inches to meters. Let me double-check. 100 inches is 2.54 meters because 1 inch is 2.54 cm, so 100 inches is 100 * 2.54 cm = 254 cm, which is 2.54 meters. Correct.

Wait, another thought: sometimes the formula is given as theta (in radians) equals 1.22 * lambda / (D), where D is in the same units as lambda. So if I use lambda in meters, D is in meters, which I did. So that's correct.

Alternatively, sometimes people use the formula with D in millimeters or something else, but no, I think it's correct as I did it.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 1.22e-2, which is 0.0122 arcseconds. Did I miscalculate? Let me go through the steps again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately. Let's compute 1.22 * (500e-9 m) / (2.54 m) = 1.22 * (500e-9 / 2.54) = 1.22 * (1.9685e-7) ≈ 2.41e-7 radians.

Then, 1 radian is 57.2958 degrees, which is 3600 * 57.2958 arcminutes, but wait, more accurately, 1 radian is equal to (180/pi) degrees, so approximately 57.2958 degrees. To get to arcseconds, multiply by 3600. So 1 rad = 57.2958 * 3600 ≈ 206265 arcseconds. So 1 rad ≈ 2.06265e5 arcseconds.

So 2.41e-7 radians * 2.06265e5 arcseconds/radian = let's compute this exactly.

2.41e-7 * 2.06265e5 = 2.41 * 2.06265 * 1e-7+5 = 2.41 * 2.06265 * 1e-2.

2.41 * 2.06265 = let's compute 2 * 2.06265 = 4.1253, plus 0.41 * 2.06265.

0.41 * 2.06265 ≈ 0.8457. So total is about 4.1253 + 0.8457 = 4.971.

Multiply by 1e-2: 4.971e-2, which is 0.04971 arcseconds, approximately 0.05, or 5e-2. So that's 5.0e-2, which is 5.0 × 10^-2 seconds of arc. But option A is 5.5e-2, which is 0.055. Hmm, a bit higher.

Wait, maybe I should use a more precise value for the wavelength. Let's see, if the wavelength is around 500 nm, but perhaps the standard value used in such problems is 550 nm. Let's recalculate with 550e-9 meters.

So theta = 1.22 * (550e-9 m) / (2.54 m) = 1.22 * (550e-9 / 2.54) = 1.22 * (2.16528e-7) ≈ 2.633e-7 radians.

Now convert that to arcseconds: 2.633e-7 * 2.06265e5 = (2.633 * 2.06265) * 1e-7+5.

2.633 * 2.06265 ≈ Let's compute 2 * 2.06265 = 4.1253, 0.633 * 2.06265 ≈ 1.308. So total is about 4.1253 + 1.308 = 5.4333.

Multiply by 1e-2: 5.4333e-2, which is approximately 5.43e-2, or 0.0543 arcseconds. That's 5.43 × 10^-2, which is very close to option A: 5.5 × 10^-2. So that must be the answer.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 1.22e-2, which is about 0.0122 arcseconds. That's an order of magnitude smaller. Where could I have gone wrong? Oh wait, perhaps I forgot that the formula gives the diffraction limit, which is the minimum resolvable separation. So the closest double star that can be resolved would have that separation. So the calculation seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the diameter in a different unit, but I think I did it right. So the answer should be option A: 5.5 × 10^-2 seconds of arc.

To determine the angular separation of the closest double star resolvable by the Mount Wilson reflecting telescope, we use the Rayleigh criterion for angular resolution:

\[
\theta = 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{D}
\]

where:
- \( \theta \) is the angular resolution in radians,
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of light (assumed to be \( 500 \, \text{nm} = 500 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \)),
- \( D \) is the diameter of the telescope's mirror (\( 100 \, \text{inches} = 2.54 \, \text{m} \)).

### Step 1: Calculate \( \theta \) in radians
\[
\theta = 1.22 \times \frac{500 \times 10^{-9}}{2.54} = 1.22 \times 1.9685 \times 10^{-7} \approx 2.41 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{radians}.
\]

### Step 2: Convert \( \theta \) to arcseconds
Since \( 1 \, \text{radian} \approx 206265 \, \text{arcseconds} \):
\[
\theta = 2.41 \times 10^{-7} \times 206265 \approx 5.0 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{arcseconds}.
\]

### Step 3: Refine with \( \lambda = 550 \, \text{nm} \)
Using \( \lambda = 550 \, \text{nm} \):
\[
\theta = 1.22 \times \frac{550 \times 10^{-9}}{2.54} = 1.22 \times 2.1653 \times 10^{-7} \approx 2.63 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{radians}.
\]
Converting to arcseconds:
\[
\theta = 2.63 \times 10^{-7} \times 206265 \approx 5.43 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{arcseconds}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with options
The calculated value \( 5.43 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{arcseconds} \) is closest to option **A: \( 5.5 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{arcseconds} \)**.
