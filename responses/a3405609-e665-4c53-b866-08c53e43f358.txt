Question:

Discuss how the quantitative measurements of the dioxy-ribonucleic acid content of cells is evidence that DNA is the genetic material.

Options:

A: The increase in DNA content following cell division indicates that DNA is the genetic material.
B: The presence of DNA in mitochondria and chloroplasts, but not in the cell nucleus, is evidence that DNA is the genetic material.
C: The constant amount of DNA in all body cells and half the amount in germ cells is evidence that DNA is the genetic material.
D: The varying amount of RNA in cells indicates that DNA is the genetic material.
E: The ratio of adenine to thymine varies greatly between different types of cells, suggesting DNA is the genetic material.
F: The presence of histones in cells proves that DNA is the genetic material.
G: The correlation between the complexity of an organism and the amount of DNA in its cells points to DNA as the genetic material.
H: The ability to synthesize proteins directly from RNA without DNA involvement demonstrates that DNA is the genetic material.
I: The consistency of DNA sequences across different species suggests that DNA is the genetic material.
J: Polyploid tissues have multiple sets of chromosomes, which shows DNA is the genetic material.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about DNA being the genetic material based on quantitative measurements. The question is a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.

The question asks which option correctly uses DNA content measurements as evidence that DNA is the genetic material. I remember that DNA is the genetic material, but how does the quantity of DNA in cells support this?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Increase in DNA after cell division. Hmm, when cells divide, like during DNA replication, each new cell gets a copy. But does that specifically show DNA is genetic material? I'm not sure. It's more about replication than evidence of function.

Option B: DNA in mitochondria and chloroplasts but not nucleus. Wait, isn't DNA present in all these places? Actually, both mitochondria and chloroplasts have their own DNA, and the nucleus has DNA too. So this option seems incorrect because it's not accurate about where DNA is found.

Option C: Constant DNA in body cells, half in germ cells. Oh, right! In most cells, DNA content is constant because they're diploid. Germ cells are haploid, so half. This is about the constancy of DNA, supporting that it's the genetic material because each cell has the necessary DNA for its functions.

Option D: RNA varies. If RNA varies, how does that show DNA is genetic? Maybe not directly relevant. RNA levels change with cell function, but that doesn't directly prove DNA's role.

Option E: Adenine to thymine ratio varies. I know that in DNA, A pairs with T. If the ratio varies, it might relate to different DNA contents, but how does that prove DNA is genetic? Not sure, maybe not the best evidence.

Option F: Presence of histones. Histones are proteins that DNA wraps around. Their presence is more about DNA packaging, not evidence of function as genetic material.

Option G: Complexity and DNA amount. More complex organisms have more DNA, but some have less. For example, humans aren't the most complex but have a lot of DNA. So this might not be a strong indicator.

Option H: Proteins from RNA. Wait, that's the opposite of what DNA's role is. DNA usually makes RNA, not the other way around. This option seems incorrect.

Option I: Consistent DNA sequences across species. Consistency would suggest common ancestry, not necessarily that DNA is the genetic material.

Option J: Polyploid tissues with multiple chromosomes. Having multiple sets affects traits, but does it show DNA is genetic? Not directly; it's more about chromosome number.

So, which option connects DNA quantity to it being the genetic material? Option C says that DNA is constant in body cells and half in germ cells. This relates to the idea that each cell has the necessary DNA (genetic info) to function, and during gamete formation, the DNA is halved to maintain species continuity. This quantitative consistency supports DNA as the genetic material because all cells need the same genetic info, which is stored in DNA. So, I think the answer is C.

The correct answer is **C**. The constancy of DNA in body cells and half the amount in germ cells supports the idea that DNA is the genetic material because it ensures that each cell has the necessary genetic information, and germ cells carry half to maintain species continuity.
