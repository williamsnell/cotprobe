Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given a normally distributed set of measurements with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. I need to find the probability that a randomly selected observation falls between 50 and 55. The options are from A to J, and I have to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that in a normal distribution, the mean is the center, so 50 is the average. The standard deviation is 10, which tells me how spread out the data is. Since the distribution is symmetric around the mean, I can use the Z-score to standardize these values and then refer to the standard normal distribution table.

First, I should calculate the Z-score for 50 and 55. The Z-score formula is Z = (X - μ)/σ, where μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation.

For X = 50:
Z = (50 - 50)/10 = 0/10 = 0. So the Z-score is 0. That makes sense because it's the mean.

For X = 55:
Z = (55 - 50)/10 = 5/10 = 0.5. So the Z-score is 0.5.

Now, I need to find the probability that Z is between 0 and 0.5. In terms of the standard normal distribution, this is the area under the curve from Z=0 to Z=0.5.

I think the standard normal table gives the area from the left up to a certain Z-score. So P(Z < 0.5) is the area up to 0.5, and P(Z < 0) is 0.5 because the mean splits the distribution into two equal parts. So the probability between 0 and 0.5 would be P(Z < 0.5) - P(Z < 0).

Looking up Z=0.5 in the table, I believe the value is around 0.6915. Because I remember that P(Z < 1) is about 0.8413, and 0.5 is halfway to 1, so maybe 0.6915. But wait, I should double-check the exact value. Let me think: the Z-table for 0.5 is 0.6915. So P(Z < 0.5) is 0.6915, and P(Z < 0) is 0.5.

Subtracting these, 0.6915 - 0.5 = 0.1915. So the probability is approximately 0.1915.

Now, looking at the options, I need to find which one is closest to 0.1915. Let me list the options with their values:

A: 0.125
B: 0.341
C: 0.180
D: 0.210
E: 0.274
F: 0.159
G: 0.300
H: 0.191
I: 0.200
J: 0.230

So 0.1915 is very close to option H: 0.191. That must be the correct answer.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through the steps again.

1. Calculated Z-scores correctly: 50 is 0, 55 is 0.5. Yes.
2. The area from 0 to 0.5 is P(Z < 0.5) minus P(Z < 0), which is 0.6915 - 0.5 = 0.1915. That's correct.
3. Looking at the options, H is 0.191, which matches closely. So yes, H is the right choice.

The probability that a randomly selected observation falls between 50 and 55 is approximately 0.191, which corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
