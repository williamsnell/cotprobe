Okay, so I have this question about the lunar maria, and I need to figure out what the correct answer is. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Moon's surface features.

I remember that the Moon has these large dark areas that are called maria. Maria is the plural of mare, which in Latin means 'sea.' So, I think that's why they're sometimes referred to as 'seas' on the Moon. But wait, are they actually filled with water? No, I don't think so. From what I've learned, the Moon doesn't have oceans like Earth. So maybe the term 'mare' is just a name, not indicating water.

Looking at the options, F says they're the Moon's equivalent to Earth's oceans. That's a bit confusing because they're not oceans, but they are dark areas, so maybe that's why they're called 'seas.' I'm not entirely sure if F is correct, though.

Option E says dark lavas filling older impact basins. I think that's right because I remember learning that the maria are vast plains formed by ancient volcanic activity. The Moon was once geologically active, and these areas were filled with lava from volcanic eruptions. So when the lava cooled, it formed these dark, smooth regions. That makes sense because the Moon's surface has these large, dark, almost circular areas.

Option C mentions dark regions caused by meteorite impacts. I'm not sure if that's correct. I thought that the maria were formed by lava, not by the impacts themselves. But wait, the impact basins might have been created by meteorites, and then later filled by lava. So maybe the cause of the dark regions is the lava filling the basins, not the impact.

Option H says dark lavas inside volcanic calderas. Calderas are large volcanic depressions, but maria are much larger than that. So H might refer to something smaller, like individual volcanic features, not the vast maria.

Option E seems more accurate because it's talking about filling impact basins, which would result in large, dark regions. So maria are indeed dark lavas that filled those basins.

Other options: A is about tectonic valleys, which I don't think relates. B says lighter colored regions, but maria are dark, so B is wrong. D is ice-filled craters near poles; I think that's more about the polar regions and maybe Shackleton Crater, but maria are equatorial. G is mountain ranges, which are highlands, not maria. I is bright regions, but maria are dark. J is ancient highlands, which are the lighter areas, called terrae, not maria.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be E: dark lavas filling older impact basins.

The lunar maria are dark, smooth regions on the Moon formed by ancient volcanic activity. They are filled with lava that poured into large impact basins created by meteorite collisions. These basins were later filled with dark lava, creating the vast, dark areas we see on the Moon. 

Answer: E
