Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Janet Firestone's stock options. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

Alright, the problem says Janet bought an option on a stock. The option gives her the right to buy 100 shares at a price of $14 and a half (which is 14.5) on or before 90 days from now. Then, one month later, she exercised her option, meaning she bought the stock at that price. She sold the stock on the same day for $17.

So, let me break this down. She bought the stock via the option for $14.50 per share, and then sold it for $17 per share. Wait, but she had an option to buy, so she's buying it at 14.5. She sells it later for $17, which is higher than 14.5, so she makes a profit from the sale.

Wait, but she also bought the stock via the option. So the calculation is about the stock's price difference. Let me think. 

The stock she bought was at 14.5. She sold it for $17. So the difference is $17 - $14.50 = $2.50 per share. Since she sold 100 shares, that's 100 * $2.50 = $250 profit. But wait, does she also have to consider the cost of the option? The option was bought for $175, but the question is about profit on the stock. So the $175 is a sunk cost for her, and she's only looking at her gains from the stock.

Wait, no, let me read the question again. The question is about her profit on the stock. So the $175 is probably a sunk cost, meaning it's already spent, so it doesn't affect her profit from the stock transaction. So the profit comes from the difference between the selling price and the purchase price.

So her profit per share is 17 - 14.5 = 2.5 dollars. She bought 100 shares, so 100 * 2.5 = $250. So looking at the options, is $250 an option? Let me check. The options are A to J, and I see option G is $150, H is $75, etc. Wait, none of the options is $250. Oh, wait, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I'm calculating something wrong. Let me recheck. The stock is sold for $17, bought at 14.5. So the profit per share is 17 - 14.5 = 2.5. For 100 shares, that's 250. But looking at the options: The options are A to J. Hmm. I don't see $250 in the options. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check. 17 minus 14.5 is indeed 2.5. 2.5 times 100 is 250. But none of the options match. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me re-examine the question.

Wait, the option was for 100 shares, giving her the right to buy at 14.5. She bought it at that price, correct. She sold it on the same day for $17. So, the profit per share is $2.5. So 100 * 2.5 is $250. But the options don't have $250. So perhaps I'm missing something. Did I misread the question? Let me check.

No, the question says she exercised the option, bought the stock for 14.5, sold for 17. So the profit is 17 - 14.5 per share for 100, which is 250. But the options don't include that. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the number of shares. Let me think.

Wait, the stock she bought was for 100 shares at 14.5. So she spent 100 * 14.5 = $1450. She sold them all for 100 * 17 = $1700. So her total profit is 1700 - 1450 = $250. So the answer should be $250. But the options don't have that. So how come? Or maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Oh wait, she bought the stock at 14.5, so 14.5 per share. She sold for 17 per share. So per share, profit is 17-14.5=2.5. For 100 shares, 2.5*100=250. So option G is $150. But 250 isn't an option here. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps there's a trick. Oh wait, maybe the calculation includes the cost of the option. But the problem states that the question is about profit on the stock, so the option's cost is a sunk cost and doesn't affect the profit from the stock. So the profit is 250, but the options don't have that. So maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps she has to pay the option's premium. The option cost is $175, but that's a cost that's already spent, so the profit from the stock is 250, but the question is about profit from the stock, so 250 is correct. But the options don't have it. So perhaps I made an error.

Wait, let me look at the options again. The options are A: $200, B: $50, C: $250, D: $65, E: $125, F: $95, G: $150, H: $75, I: $85, J: $100.

Wait, option C is $250. Oh, but the correct calculation says 250, but the question is about profit on the stock. So the correct answer should be $250, but none of the options show that. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait another thought. Maybe the option gives her the right to buy 100 shares at 14.5, which is $14.5 per share. So she bought 100 shares for 100 * 14.5 = $1450. She sells them all for 100 * 17 = $1700. So profit is 1700 - 1450 = $250. So that's correct. So the option's cost is a sunk cost, so it doesn't contribute to the profit. So the answer should be $250. But looking at the options, option C is $250. So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but the options provided don't have $250. Wait, let me check again. Oh wait, the options are A to J:

A: $200

B: $50

C: $250

D: $65

E: $125

F: $95

G: $150

H: $75

I: $85

J: $100

Yes, option C is $250. So the correct answer is C.
</think>

The correct answer is C: $250. 

**Explanation:**
- Janet bought 100 shares at $14.50 each, paying a total of $1450.
- She sold all 100 shares for $17 each, totaling $1700.
- Profit from the stock transaction is $1700 (from sale) - $1450 (cost) = $250.
- The option's cost ($175) is a sunk cost and does not affect the profit from the stock transaction.
- The correct option is C: $250.
