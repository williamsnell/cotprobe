Question:

A scientist studied the migration patterns of two types of whales. The humpback whales traveled 2,240 miles in 28 days. The gray whales traveled 2,368 miles in 32 days. If the humpback whales had traveled at the same rate for 32 days, how many more miles would they have traveled than the gray whales?

A: 64
B: 408
C: 128
D: 320
E: 280
F: 96
G: 192
H: 160
I: 256
J: 224

Okay, so I've got this problem about whales migrating and their speeds. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on these kinds of problems, but I'll take it slow.

Alright, the question says that a scientist studied two types of whales: humpback and gray. The humpback whales traveled 2,240 miles in 28 days. The gray whales went 2,368 miles in 32 days. The question is asking, if the humpback whales had traveled at the same rate for 32 days, how many more miles would they have traveled than the gray whales?

So, I think the first thing I need to do is find out the speed of each type of whale. Since speed is distance divided by time, I'll calculate that for both.

Starting with the humpback whales: they went 2,240 miles in 28 days. So their daily distance would be 2,240 divided by 28. Let me do that calculation. 2240 ÷ 28. Hmm, 28 times 80 is 2,240 because 28*80 is (28*8)*10=224*10=2,240. So that means the humpback whales travel 80 miles each day.

Now for the gray whales: they went 2,368 miles in 32 days. So their daily distance is 2,368 ÷ 32. Let's see, 32 times 70 is 2,240. Subtract that from 2,368, which leaves 128. Then 32 goes into 128 exactly 4 times. So 70 + 4 = 74. So the gray whales are traveling at 74 miles per day.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, let me double-check that. 32 times 70 is 2,240, yes. Then 2,368 minus 2,240 is 128. 32 times 4 is 128. So 70 +4=74. So yes, 74 miles per day for gray whales.

But wait, the question is about the humpback whales traveling at their own rate for 32 days, not the gray's rate. So the humpback's speed is 80 miles per day. So if they traveled for 32 days at 80 miles per day, how far would they go?

Let me calculate that: 80 * 32. Well, 80 times 30 is 2,400, and 80 times 2 is 160. So 2,400 + 160 = 2,560 miles in 32 days.

Now, the gray whales traveled 2,368 miles in 32 days. So we need to find the difference between the humpback's distance in 32 days and the gray's.

So 2,560 (humpback) minus 2,368 (gray) equals... let's subtract. 2,560 - 2,368.

Let me do this step by step. 2,560 minus 2,300 is 260. Then minus 68 more: 260 -68=192. So the difference is 192 miles.

Looking at the options, option G is 192. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Sometimes when I'm doing math in my head, I might get mixed up.

Humpback speed: 2,240 ÷28. 28*80=2,240, correct. So 80 mph.

Gray whales: 2,368 ÷32. 32*70=2,240. 2,368-2,240=128. 128 ÷32=4. So 70+4=74. Correct.

Humpback in 32 days: 80*32=2,560. Correct.

Gray in 32 days:2,368.

Difference:2,560-2,368=192. Yes, that's right.

So the answer is G:192.

The humpback whales traveled 80 miles per day, and over 32 days, they would cover 2,560 miles. The gray whales traveled 74 miles per day, covering 2,368 miles in 32 days. The difference is 2,560 - 2,368 = 192 miles. 

Answer: G
