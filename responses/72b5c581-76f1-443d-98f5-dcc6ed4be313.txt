Question:

Distinguish between the white and gray matter of the central nervous system.

Options:

A: "White matter" and "gray matter" are terms used to describe the coloration of neurons during staining procedures.
B: "White matter" is the nerve fiber pathways and "gray matter" is the collections of cell bodies.
C: "White matter" refers to unmyelinated axons, while "gray matter" refers to myelinated axons.
D: "White matter" consists of dendrites and "gray matter" consists of neuron cell bodies and axons.
E: "White matter" and "gray matter" are both types of neurons.
F: "White matter" is found only in the spinal cord, while "gray matter" is found only in the brain.
G: "White matter" is composed of glial cells only, while "gray matter" consists of both neurons and glial cells.
H: "White matter" contains the synapses and "gray matter" contains the neurotransmitters.
I: "White matter" is the myelin sheath and "gray matter" is the axons.
J: "White matter" is the collections of cell bodies and "gray matter" is the nerve fiber pathways.

Alright, so I've got this question about distinguishing between white and gray matter in the central nervous system. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Okay, I remember that the central nervous system includes the brain and spinal cord. Both have white and gray matter, but they're arranged differently. Gray matter is the part that looks gray, and white matter is, well, white. But why?

I think it's something to do with the structure of the neurons. Gray matter is where the cell bodies of neurons are, right? Like, the somas of the neurons are in gray matter. So that's where the processing happens because the cell bodies have the nucleus and all the control stuff.

Then white matter, I believe, is made up of axons. Axons are the long parts of neurons that send signals to other neurons or muscles. But why white? Oh, because axons are often covered in myelin sheaths. Myelin is that fatty substance that insulates the axons and helps speed up the nerve impulses. When you look at it under a microscope after staining, the myelin makes it appear white.

So, putting that together: gray matter has the cell bodies, and white matter has the axon pathways, especially those with myelin. That makes sense because in the brain, the gray matter is on the surface (like the cerebral cortex) and the white matter is deeper, consisting of all the connections between different brain areas.

Looking at the options now:

Option A says they're terms for color during staining. Well, that's correct, but the question is about distinguishing them functionally, not just their appearance. So A is a fact but doesn't answer the question directly.

Option B says white matter is nerve fibers (axons) and gray is cell bodies. That matches what I was thinking. So B seems right.

Option C says white is unmyelinated and gray is myelinated. Wait, that's the opposite. Unmyelinated axons would be more gray because they lack the white myelin. So C is incorrect.

Option D says white is dendrites and gray is cell bodies and axons. No, white matter is axons, not dendrites. Dendrites are part of gray matter.

Option E says both are types of neurons. No, white and gray matter aren't types of neurons. They're composed of neurons and glial cells.

Option F says white is only in spinal cord and gray only in brain. That's not true. Both are present in both brain and spinal cord.

Option G says white is glial only. No, white matter has axons, which are neurons, plus supporting cells like glia.

Option H says white has synapses and gray has neurotransmitters. No, synapses are where axons meet other neurons, so they'd be in white matter. But the main point is about structure, not the chemicals.

Option I says white is myelin and gray is axons. That's reversed. Myelin is part of white matter, but axons are the main component of white matter.

Option J says white is cell bodies and gray is pathways. That's opposite of B. So J is incorrect.

So, the correct answer should be B: "White matter" is the nerve fiber pathways and "gray matter" is the collections of cell bodies.

The distinction between white and gray matter in the central nervous system lies in their structural components. Gray matter consists of collections of neuron cell bodies, which are responsible for processing information, while white matter is composed of nerve fiber pathways, primarily axons, often covered in myelin sheaths that facilitate the transmission of nerve impulses. 

Answer: B
