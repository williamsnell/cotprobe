Question:

How does information processing theory explain rapid reading for meaning?

Options:

A: Rapid reading for meaning is achieved by focusing solely on the first and last letters of each word.
B: Rapid reading for meaning is the result of a specialized brain function that deciphers words instantly as if by intuition.
C: Rapid reading for meaning is achieved through reading each word individually.
D: Rapid reading for meaning is based on the reader's prior knowledge of a text, allowing them to anticipate content without reading.
E: Rapid reading for meaning is explained by the redundancy of the English language and the ability of readers to fill in missing letters and phrases from past experiences, allowing them to correctly infer meaning without having to process each word individually.
F: Rapid reading for meaning is only possible for highly skilled readers.
G: Rapid reading for meaning is explained by the reader's ability to skip over non-essential words while maintaining comprehension.
H: Rapid reading for meaning occurs when readers rely on visual imagery to construct meaning without reading the text.
I: Rapid reading for meaning is facilitated by subvocalization, where readers speak the words in their mind to understand the text faster.
J: Rapid reading for meaning is explained by the reader's ability to pronounce each word silently.

Okay, so I've got this question about information processing theory and rapid reading. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking how information processing theory explains rapid reading for meaning. The options are A through J, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I remember that information processing theory in psychology deals with how we receive, process, store, and use information. So when it comes to reading, it's about how we process written text efficiently.

Rapid reading, also known as skimming, is when you quickly go through text to grasp the main ideas without reading every word. But how does this relate to information processing? I think it has something to do with how our brains handle the information efficiently.

Looking at the options:

A: Focusing solely on first and last letters. That sounds a bit like a technique I've heard before, but I'm not sure if that's the theory's explanation. It might be a part of it, but maybe not the whole picture.

B: A specialized brain function as intuition. I don't think information processing is about intuition. It's more about processes and strategies, so B might not be right.

C: Reading each word individually. That's the opposite of rapid reading, so C is probably incorrect.

D: Prior knowledge allowing anticipation. I remember something about prior knowledge helping in reading. If you know the topic, you can predict what comes next, so you don't need to read every word. That sounds familiar.

E: Redundancy of English and filling in missing parts. Redundancy in language means that even if some letters are missing, the context allows you to understand. So readers can infer meaning without processing each word. This also makes sense because English has a lot of predictable patterns.

F: Only possible for skilled readers. That doesn't sound right because even less skilled readers can skim to some extent, though not as effectively.

G: Skipping non-essential words. This is similar to skimming, but I'm not sure if it's the theory's explanation. It's more of a technique than an explanation of the cognitive process.

H: Relying on visual imagery. I don't think that's the main explanation here. It might be a part of some reading strategies, but not the primary one for rapid processing.

I: Subvocalization. That's when you say words in your mind. I think subvocalization is a part of reading, but it's more about decoding words rather than the efficiency of processing for meaning.

J: Pronouncing each word silently. Again, that's about decoding, not necessarily the efficiency aspect of rapid reading.

So, between D and E. D says it's based on prior knowledge allowing anticipation. E says it's about redundancy and filling in missing info.

I think both D and E have elements of truth. From what I recall, information processing theory does talk about top-down processing, where prior knowledge and expectations help us understand text without examining every detail. So E mentions redundancy and inferring meaning, which aligns with the idea that language has predictable structures, allowing readers to fill in gaps. D is more about prior knowledge, which also contributes.

Wait, the question is about how information processing theory explains rapid reading. I think the theory emphasizes that we process information based on existing knowledge and the structure of language. So E's explanation about redundancy and inferring missing parts seems to fit better because it's about the structure and patterns, allowing efficient processing.

Alternatively, some sources might attribute this to top-down processing, which uses prior knowledge, aligning with D. But I'm a bit confused now. Let me think again.

Rapid reading often involves recognizing whole words or phrases quickly, which relies on the reader's familiarity and the predictability of language. So E's explanation seems to address how the redundancy allows us to infer meaning without processing each word, which is a key aspect of information processing.

I think E is the correct answer. It explains rapid reading as the brain using the redundancy in language and prior experiences to fill in gaps, thus processing meaning quickly without reading every word.

The correct answer is E. Information processing theory explains rapid reading for meaning through the redundancy of the English language and the reader's ability to infer missing information based on past experiences, allowing efficient comprehension without processing every word individually.

**Answer: E**
