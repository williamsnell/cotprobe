Okay, so I need to figure out which statement best explains Hart's distinction between 'being obliged' and 'having an obligation'. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that H.L.A. Hart is a significant figure in legal philosophy, and he wrote about the concept of law in his book "The Concept of Law." He discussed the idea that law isn't just about commands from a sovereign but has a structure that includes primary and secondary rules.

The question is about his distinction between 'being obliged' and 'having an obligation.' Let me think about what each of these terms means. 'Being obliged' sounds like an actual duty that someone is under, maybe something that they must do. On the other hand, 'having an obligation' might refer to the state of being able to create or recognize that duty.

Wait, in Hart's theory, he distinguishes between the obligation itself and the sense of being bound by it. So, when someone 'has an obligation,' it's about the formal recognition or the rule that creates the obligation. 'Being obliged' would be the actual duty or the feeling of being bound to act in a certain way because of that rule.

I think this relates to how legal rules work. A rule (like a law) imposes an obligation, but the act of being obliged is the practical application of that rule. So, Hart might be saying that the obligation is a rule, and the act of being obliged is the response to that rule.

Looking at the options:

A: Refuting natural law's view of morality in law. Hmm, not sure if this is about morality. The question is more about the structure of legal obligations, not necessarily about whether law should include morality.

B: Illuminates the concept of a rule. That sounds plausible because Hart is talking about rules and how they impose obligations.

C: Differentiates formal and substantive justice. I think formal justice is about equality before the law, while substantive is about the fairness of the law itself. Not directly related to obligations.

D: Importance of individual rights. While rights are part of law, the distinction here seems more about the nature of obligations rather than rights.

E: Relationship between law and society. Maybe, but I think it's more about the internal structure of law.

F: Explains power-conferring rules. Power-conferring is about permissions or abilities, not so much about obligations.

G: Distinguishes legal and ethical obligations. That's possible, but I think Hart's distinction is more about the nature of legal obligations themselves rather than comparing legal to ethical.

H: Provides a guideline for applying laws. Not exactly; this seems more about understanding the structure of law rather than application.

I: Role of judicial discretion. That's more about how judges interpret and apply laws, not the distinction between obligation concepts.

So, going back, option B says it illuminates the concept of a rule. That makes sense because Hart is explaining how rules create obligations, and the distinction helps in understanding how rules function in legal systems. The idea is that a rule imposes an obligation, and being obliged is the practical effect of that rule.

Wait, another angle: 'Having an obligation' is about the existence of the rule, while 'being obliged' is the personal sense of duty. This emphasizes that the obligation is a rule, which is a key part of Hart's primary rules of obligation. So, the distinction helps clarify what a rule isâ€”it's not just a command but something that creates a sense of duty.

Therefore, the correct answer should be B: It illuminates the concept of a rule.

The distinction between 'being obliged' and 'having an obligation' in Hart's work clarifies the nature of legal rules. 'Having an obligation' refers to the formal recognition or existence of a rule, while 'being obliged' is the practical application or sense of duty arising from that rule. This distinction emphasizes how rules function in legal systems, highlighting their role in creating obligations. 

Answer: B
