Okay, so I have this problem where a voltage of 25 angle 45 degrees volts is applied to an impedance of 4 minus j2 ohms. I need to find the current in both rectangular and polar forms. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my AC circuits, but let me try to work this out step by step.

First, I remember that current I is equal to voltage V divided by impedance Z. So I = V/Z. Both V and Z are complex numbers here, so I'll need to perform complex division. 

The voltage is given in polar form: 25∠45° V. The impedance is given in rectangular form: 4 - j2 Ω. I think it's easier to work with both in the same form, so maybe I'll convert the impedance to polar form first. Alternatively, I could convert the voltage to rectangular, but let me see which is easier.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to convert the impedance to polar so that I can divide the magnitudes and subtract the angles. Let me try that.

The impedance Z is 4 - j2. To convert this to polar form, I need the magnitude and the angle. The magnitude is the square root of (4 squared plus (-2) squared). So that's sqrt(16 + 4) = sqrt(20) = 2*sqrt(5), which is approximately 4.472 ohms.

The angle is the arctangent of the imaginary part over the real part. Since Z is 4 - j2, the imaginary part is negative. So the angle is arctan(-2/4) = arctan(-0.5). That should be in the fourth quadrant. The arctan of 0.5 is about 26.565 degrees, so the angle here would be -26.565 degrees, or equivalently 360 - 26.565 = 333.435 degrees. But usually, it's expressed as negative, so let's say θ = -26.565°. 

So Z in polar form is 2√5 ∠ -26.565° Ω.

Now, the voltage V is 25∠45° V. To find I, I divide V by Z. In polar form, I = V_magnitude / Z_magnitude, and the angle is V_angle - Z_angle.

So I_magnitude = 25 / (2√5) = 25/(2*2.236) ≈ 25/(4.472) ≈ 5.590 V. Wait, no, wait. Because 2√5 is about 4.472, so 25 divided by that is approximately 5.590? Wait, 25 / 4.472 is approximately 5.590? Wait, 4.472 * 5 = 22.36, and 4.472*5.5 = 24.596, so 5.59 is about 25. So yes, I'm getting about 5.59 A as the magnitude.

Wait, but let me calculate it more accurately. 25 divided by (2√5) is equal to (25)/(2√5). Let me rationalize the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by √5, so (25√5)/(2*5) )= (5√5)/2. Because 25√5 is 25 * 2.236 ≈ 55.9, divided by 2, that's about 27.95/2 ≈ 13.975? Wait, no, wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, wait, let me compute 25/(2√5). 2√5 is approximately 4.472. So 25 divided by 4.472 is approximately 5.590. So the magnitude of the current is approximately 5.590 A. But wait, looking at the options, I don't see any option with 5.59. Let me check.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute. 25 / (2√5) = (25)/(2*2.236) ≈ 25 / 4.472 ≈ 5.590. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it exactly. Let me see: 25/(2√5) = (25√5)/(2*5) )= (5√5)/2. Because 25/5 is 5. So (5√5)/2 is approximately (5*2.236)/2 ≈ 11.18/2 = 5.590 A. So the magnitude is 5.590 A.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have 5.59. Let me check the options again.

Option A: 2.5∠45°, so 2.5 A. Option B: 2.5√5∠71.6°, which is about 2.5*2.236 ≈5.59 A. Oh, yes, that's the same as I have. So the magnitude is 5.59 A, which is 2.5√5 A.

Wait, 2.5√5 is indeed 2.5 * 2.236 ≈ 5.59, so that's correct. So the magnitude is 2.5√5 A.

Now for the angle. The voltage is at 45°, and the impedance is at -26.565°. So the angle of the current is 45° minus (-26.565°) = 45 + 26.565 = 71.565°, which is approximately 71.6°. So the current in polar form is 2.5√5 ∠71.6° A.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.5√5∠71.6° A in polar form. So that's the polar form. Now I need to check the rectangular form as well.

To find the rectangular form, I can convert the polar form of the current to rectangular. The current is I = I_magnitude ∠θ. So the real part is I_magnitude * cosθ, and the imaginary part is I_magnitude * sinθ.

θ is 71.6°, so cos(71.6) is approximately 0.316, and sin(71.6) is about 0.948.

So I_real ≈ 5.590 * 0.316 ≈ 1.767 A.

I_imaginary ≈5.590 * 0.948 ≈5.307 A.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute using exact expressions.

Wait, another way: since we have I = V/(Z), and V is in rectangular form and Z is in rectangular form, perhaps it's easier to compute I in rectangular by dividing the complex numbers.

Wait, let me try that approach. Let's see.

V is 25∠45°, which in rectangular form is 25 cos45 + j25 sin45. Cos45 and sin45 are both √2/2 ≈0.7071. So V_rect = 25*(0.7071) + j25*(0.7071) ≈ 17.6775 + j17.6775 V.

Z is 4 - j2 Ω.

So I = V / Z = (17.6775 + j17.6775) / (4 - j2).

To divide complex numbers, I can multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator.

The conjugate of 4 - j2 is 4 + j2.

So numerator becomes (17.6775 + j17.6775)(4 + j2).

Denominator becomes (4)^2 + (2)^2 = 16 +4=20.

Let me compute the numerator:

(17.6775)(4) = 70.71.

(17.6775)(j2) = j35.355.

(j17.6775)(4) = j70.71.

(j17.6775)(j2) = j^2 *35.355 = -35.355.

So adding all terms:

70.71 + j35.355 + j70.71 -35.355.

The real parts: 70.71 -35.355 ≈35.355.

The imaginary parts: 35.355 +70.71 ≈106.065.

So numerator is approximately 35.355 + j106.065.

Divide by denominator 20:

I_real = 35.355 /20 ≈1.7678 A.

I_imag =106.065 /20 ≈5.3033 A.

So in rectangular form, I ≈1.7678 + j5.3033 A.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see which option matches this.

Option B's rectangular form is 1.25√2 + j3.75√2 A.

Let me compute 1.25√2: 1.25 *1.4142 ≈1.76775 A.

3.75√2: 3.75*1.4142≈5.303 A.

Yes, so the rectangular form is 1.25√2 + j3.75√2 A, which matches option B.

So the current in polar form is 2.5√5∠71.6° A, and in rectangular form is 1.25√2 + j3.75√2 A.

Looking at the options, option B matches both forms.

To determine the current in both rectangular and polar forms when a voltage of \( 25\angle45^\circ \, \text{V} \) is applied to an impedance of \( 4 - j2 \, \Omega \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Convert Impedance to Polar Form**:  
   The impedance \( Z = 4 - j2 \, \Omega \) has a magnitude \( |Z| = \sqrt{4^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5} \, \Omega \).  
   The angle \( \theta_Z \) is \( \arctan\left(\frac{-2}{4}\right) = -26.565^\circ \).  
   Thus, \( Z = 2\sqrt{5} \angle -26.565^\circ \, \Omega \).

2. **Compute Current in Polar Form**:  
   Using \( I = \frac{V}{Z} \):  
   - Magnitude: \( |I| = \frac{25}{2\sqrt{5}} = \frac{5\sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 5.590 \, \text{A} \).  
   - Angle: \( \theta_I = 45^\circ - (-26.565^\circ) = 71.6^\circ \).  
   Therefore, \( I = 2.5\sqrt{5} \angle 71.6^\circ \, \text{A} \).

3. **Convert Current to Rectangular Form**:  
   Using \( I = I_{\text{mag}} \cos(\theta_I) + j I_{\text{mag}} \sin(\theta_I) \):  
   - Real part: \( I_{\text{real}} = 2.5\sqrt{5} \cos(71.6^\circ) \approx 1.25\sqrt{2} \, \text{A} \).  
   - Imaginary part: \( I_{\text{imag}} = 2.5\sqrt{5} \sin(71.6^\circ) \approx 3.75\sqrt{2} \, \text{A} \).  
   Thus, \( I = 1.25\sqrt{2} + j3.75\sqrt{2} \, \text{A} \).

4. **Match with Options**:  
   The polar form \( 2.5\sqrt{5} \angle 71.6^\circ \, \text{A} \) and rectangular form \( 1.25\sqrt{2} + j3.75\sqrt{2} \, \text{A} \) correspond to **Option B**.
