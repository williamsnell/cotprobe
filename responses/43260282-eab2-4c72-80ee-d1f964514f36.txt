Okay, so I have to find the mass of air in this closed chamber. The chamber's dimensions are 35 ft × 20 ft × 10 ft. The pressure is 17 lb/in², and the temperature is 75°F. They told me to assume air is an ideal gas, so I should use the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. But wait, I need to make sure all the units are consistent. Let me jot down the steps.

First, I need to calculate the volume of the chamber. The volume in cubic feet would be 35 * 20 * 10. Let me do that: 35 times 20 is 700, times 10 is 7000 cubic feet. So V = 7000 ft³.

But the pressure is given in pounds per square inch (lb/in²), and the volume is in cubic feet. I need to convert the volume to cubic inches because the pressure is in psi, which is per square inch. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, 1 cubic foot is 12^3 = 1728 cubic inches. So the volume in cubic inches is 7000 * 1728. Let me calculate that: 7000 * 1728. Hmm, 7000 * 1000 is 7,000,000, and 7000 * 728 is... Wait, maybe I should just multiply 7000 * 1728. Let me see: 7000 * 1728 = 7000 * 1700 = 11,900,000 and 7000 * 28 = 196,000, so total is 12,096,000 cubic inches. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 1728 is 12^3, so 7000 * 1728 = 7000 * 1728. Let me compute 7000 * 1728:

7000 * 1728 = 7000 * (1700 + 28) = 7000*1700 = 11,900,000 and 7000*28=196,000. So adding them gives 12,096,000 cubic inches. Wait, that can't be right because 7000 ft³ is a lot. Let me double-check. Oh wait, no, 7000 ft³ multiplied by 1728 in³/ft³ is indeed 7000 * 1728 = 12,096,000 in³. Yeah, that's correct.

Now, pressure is 17 lb/in². So P is 17 psi, which is 17 lb/in². So in the ideal gas law, P is in lb/in², V is in in³, R is the gas constant in units that match. I think the gas constant R for air is 10.73 psi·ft³/(lbm·°R), but wait, I need to make sure the units are consistent. Alternatively, I might need to convert R to in³ and psi. Let me think.

Wait, the standard R for air is 10.73 when using psi, cubic feet, lbm, and absolute temperature in Rankine. But wait, my volume is in cubic inches now. Hmm, maybe I should convert R to in³ units. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to convert the volume back to cubic feet but use R in psi·in³/(lbm·°R). Wait, maybe I'm complicating things.

Alternatively, I can use the ideal gas law with compatible units. Let me check the units for R. The universal gas constant R is 10.73 psi·ft³/(lbm·°R). But since I've converted the volume to cubic inches, maybe I should find R in psi·in³/(lbm·°R). Since 1 ft³ = 1728 in³, R would be 10.73 * 1728 psi·in³/(lbm·°R). Let me compute that: 10.73 * 1728. 10 * 1728 = 17,280, 0.73 * 1728 ≈ 1263.84. So total R ≈ 17,280 + 1,263.84 = 18,543.84 psi·in³/(lbm·°R).

Wait, but maybe that's not necessary. Alternatively, perhaps I should convert the volume back to cubic feet and use R as 10.73. Let me try that approach.

So V = 7000 ft³. P = 17 psi. T is 75°F, which I need to convert to Rankine. °R = °F + 459.67. So 75 + 459.67 = 534.67 °R.

Now, the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. But n is in lbm, and R is in psi·ft³/(lbm·°R). Wait, no, PV is in psi·ft³, and nRT is in lbm·(psi·ft³/(lbm·°R))·°R, which simplifies to psi·ft³. So the equation is correct.

Wait, but the ideal gas law is usually written as PV = nRT, where R is the gas constant. So rearranging for n, n = PV/(RT).

But here, n is the number of moles, but wait, no—no, in this case, when using lbm, R is in those units, and n is the mass in lbm. Wait, no, actually, in the ideal gas law, n is the number of moles, but when using the specific form for lbm, R is adjusted accordingly. Let me make sure.

Wait, the correct form when using lbm, psi, and °R is PV = mRT, where m is the mass in lbm, and R is 10.73 psi·ft³/(lbm·°R). So yes, m = PV/(RT).

So plugging in the numbers:

P = 17 psi

V = 7000 ft³

R = 10.73 psi·ft³/(lbm·°R)

T = 534.67 °R

So m = (17 psi * 7000 ft³) / (10.73 psi·ft³/(lbm·°R) * 534.67 °R)

Let me compute the denominator first: 10.73 * 534.67 ≈ let's see. 10 * 534.67 = 5346.7, 0.73 * 534.67 ≈ approx 0.7 *535=374.5, 0.03*535=16.05, so total 374.5 +16.05=390.55. So total denominator R*T ≈ 5346.7 +390.55 ≈ 5737.25.

So numerator is 17 *7000 = 119,000.

So m ≈ 119,000 / 5737.25 ≈ let's compute that.

Hmm, 5737.25 * 20 = 114,745.

Subtracting that from 119,000 gives 4,255 left.

5737.25 * 0.74 ≈ 5737 *0.7=4,015.9; 5737 *0.04=229.48. So 4,015.9 +229.48 =4,245.38. So 20.74 would give roughly 5737.25 *20.74 ≈ 119,000.

So m ≈ 20.74 lbm. Wait, that's way too low. But the options are all in the hundreds. Wait, did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, that can't be right because 20 lbm is way too small for that volume and pressure. I must have messed up the units somewhere.

Wait, let me double-check. I think I might have messed up the unit conversion for the volume. Let me try an alternative approach.

Wait, another approach: The standard way is to use the ideal gas law with compatible units. Let me try converting everything to SI units, but maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me go back. Maybe I should compute m = (P * V) / (R * T), but perhaps I messed up the calculation.

Wait, P is 17 psi, V is 7000 ft³. R is 10.73 psi·ft³/(lbm·°R), T is 534.67 °R.

So m = (17 *7000) / (10.73 *534.67)

Compute numerator: 17 *7000 = 119,000.

Denominator: 10.73 *534.67 ≈ let's compute more accurately.

10.73 *500 =5,365.

10.73 *34.67 ≈ let's see: 10 *34.67=346.7, 0.73 *34.67≈25.33. So total 346.7 +25.33≈372.03.

So total denominator is 5,365 + 372.03 ≈ 5,737.03.

So m ≈ 119,000 /5,737.03 ≈ let's compute that.

5,737.03 * 20 =114,740.6.

119,000 -114,740.6 =4,259.4.

Now, 4,259.4 /5,737.03 ≈ 0.742.

So total m≈20.742 lbm. That's the same as before. But that's way too low because the options are in the hundreds. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait a minute, perhaps I confused pounds mass (lbm) with pounds force (lbf). Oh no, wait, in the ideal gas law, when using psi, which is pounds per square inch, that's pounds force per square inch. So maybe I should have used R in terms of lbf·ft²/(lbm·°R) or something else. Hmm, perhaps I'm using the wrong R.

Wait, I think the correct R when using psi, lbm, and °R is 10.73 psi·ft³/(lbm·°R). So that part seems correct. So why am I getting such a low mass?

Wait, let me think about the chamber's volume. 35x20x10 is 7000 ft³. That's a really large volume. But the pressure is only 17 psi, which is higher than atmospheric (which is about 14.7 psi). So perhaps the mass is around a few hundred lbm, which aligns with the options given.

Wait, but according to my calculation, it's only about 20 lbm, which is way off. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the numbers again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the denominator. Let me compute 10.73 * 534.67 more accurately.

10.73 * 500 =5,365.

10.73 *34.67: Let's compute 10.73 *30=321.9, 10.73 *4.67≈50.35. So 321.9+50.35≈372.25.

So total denominator is 5,365 + 372.25 =5,737.25.

So numerator is 119,000.

So 119,000 divided by 5,737.25.

Let me compute that: 5,737.25 * 20 =114,745.

Subtract that from 119,000: 4,255.

Now, 4,255 /5,737.25 ≈ 0.742.

So total m≈20.74 lbm. That's the same result as before. But this can't be right because the options are in the hundreds.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the volume. Let me check that again. The chamber is 35 x20x10 ft. So V=35*20*10=7000 ft³. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should have converted the pressure to absolute pressure. Wait, but the problem says pressure is 17 psi. Is that gauge pressure or absolute? Because in some contexts, psi is absolute, but sometimes gauge. Wait, the problem says 'pressure is 17 lb/in²', without specifying, but in engineering, sometimes pressure is given as absolute. But let me think: If it's gauge, then absolute pressure would be 17 +14.7 ≈31.7 psi. But if it's absolute, then it's 17 psi.

Wait, that could make a big difference. Let me check: If I use 17 psi as absolute pressure, then my previous calculation stands. But if it's gauge, then P =17 +14.7=31.7 psi.

Let me try that. So if P is 31.7 psi, then numerator becomes 31.7 *7000 =221,900.

Denominator is same:5,737.25.

So m=221900 /5,737.25 ≈ let's compute:

5,737.25 *38 = let's see: 5,737 *30=172,110, 5,737 *8=45,896. So total 172,110 +45,896=218,006. That's close to 221,900. So 38.02 lbm.

Still low. But the options are in the hundreds. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong units for R. Let me check the value of R again.

Wait, perhaps R is in different units. Let me confirm the value of R when using psi, lbm, and °R.

Upon checking, R for air is indeed 10.73 psi·ft³/(lbm·°R). So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I should have used the volume in cubic feet without converting to inches, but perhaps I should have kept everything in feet. Wait, no, because the pressure is in psi, which is per square inch, so the volume in cubic inches is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have kept the volume in cubic feet and used a different R. Let me try that.

Wait, another approach: Let's convert pressure to pascals, volume to cubic meters, and use R in J/(mol·K), but that might be more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the ideal gas law in imperial units.

Wait, I found another source that says the specific gas constant for air is R = 1716 ft·lbm/(lbmol·°R). Hmm, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the universal gas constant, R = 10.73 psi·ft³/(lbm·°R).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try calculating m = (P * V) / (R * T) again.

P =17 psi

V=7000 ft³

R=10.73 psi·ft³/(lbm·°R)

T=75°F =75 +459.67=534.67 °R

So m= (17 *7000)/(10.73 *534.67)

Compute numerator:17 *7000=119,000.

Denominator:10.73 *534.67= let's compute accurately.

10.73 *500=5,365.

10.73 *34.67: Let's compute 10.73 *34=364.82, 10.73*0.67≈7.201. So total 364.82 +7.201=372.021.

So denominator =5,365 +372.021=5,737.021.

So m=119,000 /5,737.021 ≈20.74 lbm. That's 20.74 lbm, but the options are in the hundreds. So I'm way off. There's a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a conversion factor. Let me think again. Maybe the volume was converted incorrectly. Let me check that.

Wait, 1 ft =12 inches, so 1 ft³ =12^3 =1728 in³. So 7000 ft³ =7000 *1728 in³=12,096,000 in³. Correct.

So when I have P in psi and V in in³, I can use R in psi·in³/(lbm·°R). So what's R in those units?

Since R is 10.73 psi·ft³/(lbm·°R), and 1 ft³=1728 in³, R in psi·in³/(lbm·°R) is 10.73 *1728 ≈18,542.64 psi·in³/(lbm·°R).

Now, using this R, the calculation becomes:

m = (P * V) / (R * T) = (17 psi *12,096,000 in³) / (18,542.64 psi·in³/(lbm·°R) *534.67 °R)

Compute numerator:17 *12,096,000 =205,632,000.

Denominator:18,542.64 *534.67 ≈ let's compute.

18,542.64 *500=9,271,320.

18,542.64 *34.67≈ let's compute 18,542.64 *30=556,279.2, 18,542.64 *4.67≈86,650. So total ≈556,279.2 +86,650≈642,929.2.

So denominator ≈9,271,320 +642,929.2≈9,914,249.2.

So m ≈205,632,000 /9,914,249.2 ≈ let's compute.

Divide numerator and denominator by 1000: 205,632 /9,914.25 ≈ let's see.

9,914.25 *20=198,285.

Subtract that from 205,632: 205,632 -198,285=7,347.

Now, 9,914.25 *0.74≈7,344.

So total m≈20.74 lbm. Again, same result. So that can't be right because the options are much higher.

Wait, I must be making a mistake in the approach. Let me think differently. Maybe I should use the density of air at given conditions.

Density (ρ) = (P * M) / (R * T), where M is molar mass, but perhaps that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the density of air in lbm/ft³ at 17 psi and 75°F and then multiply by volume.

Wait, at standard conditions (14.7 psi, 60°F), the density of air is about 0.0765 lbm/ft³. But at higher pressure and higher temperature, the density changes.

The formula for density is ρ = (P * M) / (R * T), where M is molar mass. But perhaps I can use the ideal gas density formula.

Alternatively, I can use the specific volume, which is 1/density. The specific volume in imperial units is (R*T)/(P*M), but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should use the ideal gas law in terms of lbm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the conversion factor from standard conditions.

Wait, maybe I should compute the mass using the ideal gas law correctly, but perhaps I missed a factor. Let me try another approach.

I think I made a mistake in the units of R. Let me confirm the correct value of R when using lbm, psi, and °R.

Upon checking, R is indeed 10.73 psi·ft³/(lbm·°R). So that's correct.

Wait, but maybe I should have used the volume in cubic feet and R in psi·ft³/(lbm·°R). Let me try that again.

So V=7000 ft³.

P=17 psi.

R=10.73 psi·ft³/(lbm·°R).

T=534.67 °R.

So m = (17 *7000) / (10.73 *534.67).

17 *7000=119,000.

10.73 *534.67≈5737.25.

So m=119,000 /5,737.25≈20.74 lbm.

But that's way too low. So something's wrong. Wait, maybe the pressure is in psf (pounds per square foot) instead of psi? No, the question says lb/in², so that's psi.

Wait, perhaps the chamber is under vacuum, but that's not the case here. Or perhaps I'm using the wrong temperature conversion.

Wait, 75°F to Rankine: 75 +459.67=534.67, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be m = (P * V) / (R * T), but using the correct units.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing lbm with lbf. Let me think: In the ideal gas law, the units must be consistent. When using lbm, R is in psi·ft³/(lbm·°R). So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the specific gas constant for air, which is R_specific = R_universal / M, where M is molar mass.

Wait, R_universal is 10.73 psi·ft³/(lbmol·°R). Wait, no, perhaps I'm confusing units here.

Wait, the universal gas constant R is 10.73 psi·ft³/(lbmol·°R). So for air, which has a molar mass of 28.97 lbm/lbmol, the specific gas constant R_specific is R_universal / M.

So R_specific = 10.73 /28.97 ≈0.370 psi·ft³/(lbm·°R).

Wait, that's different from what I used earlier. So earlier I used 10.73, which is actually R_universal. But when using lbm, we should use R_specific, which is approximately 0.370 psi·ft³/(lbm·°R).

Ah, that's probably where I went wrong. So let me recalculate using R_specific =0.370.

So m = (P * V) / (R_specific * T) = (17 psi *7000 ft³) / (0.370 psi·ft³/(lbm·°R) *534.67 °R).

Compute denominator: 0.370 *534.67 ≈0.370 *500=185, 0.370 *34.67≈12.83. Total≈197.83 psi·ft³/(lbm).

Numerator:17 *7000=119,000 psi·ft³.

So m=119,000 /197.83≈601.2 lbm.

Ah, that makes sense. So the mass is approximately 601 lbm, which corresponds to option C.
</think>

To determine the mass of air in the closed chamber, we use the ideal gas law:

\[
PV = mRT
\]

where:
- \(P = 17 \, \text{lb/in}^2\) (absolute pressure),
- \(V = 35 \, \text{ft} \times 20 \, \text{ft} \times 10 \, \text{ft} = 7000 \, \text{ft}^3\),
- \(R = 0.370 \, \text{psi·ft}^3/(\text{lbm·°R})\) (specific gas constant for air),
- \(T = 75 + 459.67 = 534.67 \, \text{°R}\).

Rearranging for \(m\):

\[
m = \frac{PV}{RT}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
m = \frac{17 \times 7000}{0.370 \times 534.67}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
17 \times 7000 = 119,000
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
0.370 \times 534.67 \approx 197.83
\]

Finally, divide:

\[
m = \frac{119,000}{197.83} \approx 601.2 \, \text{lbm}
\]

Thus, the mass of air in the chamber is approximately **601 lbm**, corresponding to option **C**.

Answer: C
