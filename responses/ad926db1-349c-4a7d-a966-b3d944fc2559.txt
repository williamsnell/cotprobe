Okay, so I've got this question about productivity in two countries, X and Z. I'm a bit rusty on economics, but let's see if I can figure this out. 

First, I remember that productivity of labor usually refers to how much output each worker produces. So, I think I need to calculate the output per worker for each country.

Country X has an output of 30,000 units and 3,000 workers. So, to find productivity per worker in X, I divide the output by the number of workers. That would be 30,000 divided by 3,000. Let me do that: 30,000 รท 3,000 equals 10. So, each worker in X produces 10 units.

Now, looking at Country Z, the output is 40,000 units with 8,000 workers. So, productivity per worker in Z is 40,000 รท 8,000. That calculation gives me 5. So each worker in Z produces 5 units.

Wait, that seems odd because Z has higher output but more workers. So, per worker, X is higher. Let me double-check my math. For X: 30k รท 3k is indeed 10. For Z: 40k รท 8k is 5. Yep, that's right.

So, productivity in X is 10 units per worker, and in Z it's 5 units per worker. That means X is more productive than Z. Now, I need to find out by what percentage.

To find the percentage increase from Z to X, I think I should compare X's productivity to Z's. The formula for percentage increase is ((X - Z)/Z) * 100%. Here, X's productivity is 10, Z's is 5. So, (10-5)/5 = 5/5 = 1. So, 1 times 100% is 100%. Hmm, that suggests X is 100% more productive than Z, which would mean X is twice as productive as Z.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see an option that says X is twice as much. Let me check the options again. Option I says X is twice as much as Z, but I don't see that in the options. Wait, let me look again.

Wait, the options are A to J. Let me list them:

A: X is 75% higher than Z.

B: X is 33% higher than Z.

C: Z is 33% higher than X.

D: Z is 50% higher than X.

E: X is 50% higher than Z.

F: Same productivity.

G: X is 25% lower than Z.

H: Z's productivity is twice X's.

I: X is twice Z's.

J: Z is 25% higher than X.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because Z's productivity is 5 and X's is 10. So X is producing double what Z is. So X is 100% more than Z. But 100% higher is twice as much. So X is 100% higher than Z, which is the same as being twice as much.

Looking at the options, option I says "The productivity of labor in country X is twice as much as country Z." So that would be correct if X is twice Z's productivity. But let me check if I got the percentages right.

Wait, when someone says A is X% higher than B, the formula is (A - B)/B * 100%. So in this case, X's productivity is 10, Z's is 5. So (10-5)/5 = 1, which is 100% higher. So X is 100% more productive than Z, meaning X is twice as productive.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option I is "twice as much as in Z." So that's correct. But looking at the options, option E says X is 50% higher than Z. That would be if X's productivity was 7.5, but no, it's 10. So 10 is 100% higher than 5, not 50%.

Alternatively, maybe I should look at Z's productivity relative to X. So Z's productivity is 5, and X is 10. So Z is half of X. So Z's productivity is 50% of X's. So Z is 50% lower than X, which would mean X is twice as productive as Z.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option H says Z is twice as much as X, which is not correct because Z is only half. Option D says Z is 50% higher than X, which is the opposite. So D is wrong.

Option C says Z is 33% higher than X, which would mean Z's productivity is 13.33, which isn't the case. So the correct comparison is that X is twice as much as Z, which is option I. But wait, let me check if any other options match.

Wait, another way: sometimes people get confused between percentage increase and times higher. For example, if X is twice as much as Z, that's a 100% increase. So if Z is 5, X is 10, which is 100% higher. So in that case, the correct statement would be "X is 100% higher than Z," but none of the options say that. The closest is option A (75%), B (33%), E (50%), or I (twice as much).

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me try calculating Z's productivity relative to X. So Z's productivity is 5, X's is 10. So Z is 5, which is 50% of 10. So Z is 50% less than X, or X is 100% higher than Z. So the correct statement would be that X's productivity is 100% higher than Z's, which is not exactly an option. But the options don't have 100%, so perhaps the closest is option I, which states X is twice as much as Z. Because twice as much implies a 100% increase.

Wait, but option I says "twice as much as in Z." So that would mean X is 2 times Z, which is correct because 10 is 2 times 5. So option I is correct.

But wait, let me check the options again. Option I is indeed "The productivity of labor in country X is twice as much as country Z." So that's correct. But let me make sure none of the other options fit better.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about labor productivity as output per worker, which I've calculated correctly. So yes, X is twice as productive as Z, so option I is correct.

Wait, but wait a second. Another approach: sometimes productivity can be measured as output per worker, but maybe the question is considering labor productivity as total output divided by total labor. But no, that's the same as output per worker. So I think my initial approach was correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about labor productivity as the ratio of output to labor, so X is 30000/3000=10, Z is 40000/8000=5. So X is 10, Z is 5. So X is 100% higher than Z, which is twice as much. So option I is correct.

Wait, but let me check if any of the other options could be correct. For example, if someone thought Z's productivity is higher, but that's not the case because 5 is less than 10. So options C, D, H, J suggest Z's productivity is higher, which is wrong.

So the correct answer is option I.
</think>

The productivity of labor is calculated as output per worker. For Country X, productivity is \( \frac{30,000}{3,000} = 10 \) units per worker. For Country Z, productivity is \( \frac{40,000}{8,000} = 5 \) units per worker. Comparing the two, Country X's productivity is twice that of Country Z. Therefore, the correct answer is:

I

The productivity of labor in country X is twice as much as in country Z.
