Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

What prevents the stomach from being digested by itsown secretions?

Options:

A: A thick layer of fat surrounds the stomach, providing protection from digestive acids.
B: Special bacteria in the stomach neutralize all digestive enzymes.
C: The stomach lining secretes an alkaline substance that counteracts the acid and prevents digestion.
D: The lining of the stomach secretes only hydrochloric acid and gastric juice.
E: The mucus layer, the permeability of the membranes and the continual replacement of the cells comprising the lining all help protect the underlying tissues from the action of proteolytic enzymes of the stomach and duodenum.
F: The stomach is coated with a layer of strong antibiotics that kill digestive enzymes.
G: The stomach lining is replaced every 10 to 15 days.
H: The stomach has a high permeability to hydrogen ions.
I: The stomach has a unique pH that prevents enzymes from being active.
J: Digestive enzymes in the stomach are only activated by food, so they do not attack the stomach lining.

Okay, so I have this question about what prevents the stomach from digesting itself. I remember that the stomach is really acidic because it uses hydrochloric acid to break down food. But how does it not eat itself? Let me think through the options.

Option A says a thick layer of fat protects it. I don't think that's right. Fat might cushion, but I don't recall it being the main reason the stomach doesn't digest itself. Plus, the stomach is more about acid and mucus.

Option B suggests special bacteria neutralize enzymes. Wait, the stomach does have some bacteria, like in the stomach acid, but I don't think they neutralize enzymes. The stomach acid actually kills most bacteria, so this might not be correct.

Option C says the lining secretes an alkaline substance. Hmm, the stomach's pH is very low (acidic), so an alkaline substance would counteract that. I think the stomach lining does produce something to protect itself, but is it alkaline? Maybe it's more about mucus and bicarbonate?

Option D states the lining secretes only hydrochloric acid and gastric juice. That doesn't make sense because the stomach does produce more than just acid; it also has enzymes like pepsin. So D is probably wrong because it's not only those.

Option E talks about a mucus layer, membrane permeability, and cell replacement. I remember that the stomach lining is constantly renewing because the cells don't live very long. The mucus probably forms a barrier, and the cells are replaced quickly to prevent damage from acid and enzymes. This sounds plausible.

Option F says a layer of antibiotics. That doesn't seem right. Antibiotics would kill bacteria, not enzymes. Plus, the stomach's own secretions are what's protecting it, not antibiotics.

Option G says the lining is replaced every 10-15 days. I know the stomach lining cells turnover quickly, maybe even every few days, but is that the main reason? It's part of the protection, but E mentions it along with other factors, so E might be better.

Option H suggests high permeability to hydrogen ions. I'm not sure. High permeability might actually allow more acid, so that might not protectâ€”it could be the opposite of what's needed.

Option I says a unique pH stops enzymes. The stomach's pH is around 1-2, which is very acidic. Some enzymes might not work in that pH, but I think the main protection is the mucus layer, not just pH. Plus, the enzymes are usually activated in that environment, so I'm not sure.

Option J claims enzymes are only activated by food. That doesn't sound right because the enzymes are active when there's acid, whether there's food or not. So J is probably incorrect.

Putting it together, the correct answer seems to be E. The mucus layer, how permeable the membranes are, and the constant renewal of cells all work together to protect the stomach lining from its own enzymes and acid. I think E is the best answer because it covers multiple protective mechanisms.

The stomach is protected from its own secretions by a combination of factors. The mucus layer acts as a physical barrier, preventing the acid and enzymes from coming into direct contact with the underlying tissues. Additionally, the stomach lining has a high rate of cell turnover, meaning that the cells are constantly replaced, which helps to minimize the damage caused by the acidic environment. These mechanisms work together to protect the stomach from self-digestion.
