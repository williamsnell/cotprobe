Okay, so I've got this inverse Laplace transform problem to solve. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question has two parts: part (a) is finding the inverse Laplace transform of 2s / (s² + 1)², and part (b) is finding the inverse Laplace transform of 1 / sqrt(s). There are multiple options provided, labeled A to J, and I need to select the correct ones.

Starting with part (a): L⁻¹{2s / (s² + 1)²}. Hmm, I remember that Laplace transforms have standard forms, and sometimes we can use differentiation properties or known transforms to find the inverse.

I recall that the Laplace transform of sin(t) is L{sin(t)} = 1/(s² + 1). Also, there's a property that if you have a function multiplied by s in the Laplace domain, it relates to the derivative in the time domain. Alternatively, sometimes when we have higher powers in the denominator, we can use differentiation or integration techniques.

Wait, another approach: partial fractions or using known inverse Laplace transforms. I think the denominator here is (s² + 1) squared. So maybe I can express 2s/(s² +1)^2 as a derivative of some simpler function.

I remember that the Laplace transform of t*sin(t) involves differentiation. Let me think: L{t sin(t)}. Using the property that L{t f(t)} = -F’(s), where F(s) is the Laplace transform of f(t). So if F(s) is L{sin(t)} = 1/(s² +1), then the Laplace transform of t sin(t) would be -d/ds [1/(s² +1)].

Let me compute that derivative: d/ds [1/(s² +1)] = -2s/(s² +1)^2. So L{t sin(t)} = -(-2s/(s² +1)^2) = 2s/(s² +1)^2. Wait, that's exactly the function we have in part (a)! So that means the inverse Laplace transform of 2s/(s² +1)^2 is t sin(t). So for part (a), the answer should be t sin(t).

Now looking at the options, which ones have t sin(t) as part (a)? Let's check the options:

Option A: t sin t, ... So part (a) is correct here.

Option B: cos t, ... No, part (a) is cos t, which isn't right.

Option C: e^t sin t, ... No.

Option D: t cos t, ... No.

Option E: t^2 sin t, ... No.

Option F: t tan t, ... No.

Option G: t^2 e^t, ... No.

Option H: t sec t, ... No.

Option I: e^t cos t, ... No.

Option J: sin t, ... No.

So the only option where part (a) is t sin(t) is option A.

Now moving to part (b): L⁻¹{1 / sqrt(s)}. I need to find the inverse Laplace transform of 1/sqrt(s). Hmm, I remember that the Laplace transform of t^(n-1) / Γ(n) is 1/s^{n}, where Γ(n) is the gamma function. For n=1/2, since 1/sqrt(s) is 1/s^{1/2}.

So the inverse Laplace transform would involve t^{(1/2) -1} / Γ(1/2). Let me compute that: t^{-1/2} / sqrt(π), because Γ(1/2) is sqrt(π). So that simplifies to 1/(sqrt(π) * sqrt(t)).

Looking at the options, which one has this as part (b)? Let me check each option's second part.

Option A: (1 / sqrt(π)) * (1 / sqrt(t)). That's exactly what I have.

Option B: (1 / sqrt(π)) * t e^{-t^2}. No, that's something else.

Option C: (1 / 2 sqrt(π)) * t. No.

Option D: (1 / sqrt(π)) * (1 / sqrt(t)). Yes, but let me see if the first part matches.

Wait, in option A, part (a) is correct, and part (b) matches. Option D's part (a) is t cos t, which we know is wrong for part (a). So the correct option would be A.

Double-checking: Part (a) is 2s/(s²+1)^2, which is t sin t, and part (b) is 1/sqrt(s), which is 1/(sqrt(π) sqrt(t)). So option A matches both.
</think>

The inverse Laplace transform of 2s / (s² + 1)² is t sin(t), and the inverse Laplace transform of 1 / sqrt(s) is (1 / sqrt(π)) * (1 / sqrt(t)). The correct option is A.

Answer: A
