Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about the global fertility rate as of 2015. The options are A through J, with numbers ranging from 0.5 to 6.5 children per woman. Hmm, I remember that fertility rates have been decreasing over the years, but I'm not exactly sure what the exact number was in 2015.

Let me think. I think the global fertility rate has been dropping for a while. I remember hearing that some countries have lower rates, even below replacement level, which is usually around 2.1. But globally, it's an average across all countries. So maybe it's a bit higher than 2, but not super high either.

Wait, I think the average global fertility rate is often cited as around 2.5 children per woman. I've heard that figure before in some reports or documentaries. But I'm not 100% certain. Let me try to recall any sources. The United Nations or World Bank might have data on this. I think the rate was around 2.5, but I'm not sure if it's higher or lower now.

Wait, the options include I: 2.5. That seems familiar. But I'm a bit confused because some regions have higher rates. For example, Sub-Saharan Africa might have a higher fertility rate, while more developed countries have lower rates. So the global average would be somewhere in between.

I also remember that in 2015, the global fertility rate was declining, but it's still above 2. So looking at the options, A is 2, F is 1.5, which might be too low. Options like B, C, E, J are higher than 2.5, which seems unlikely because I think the rate was around that number or slightly below. Wait, no, 2.5 is exactly option I. So maybe the correct answer is I: 2.5.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. If the rate was 2.5, that's the average. Some regions are higher, some lower, but the global average is about 2.5. Yeah, I think that's right. So the answer should be I: 2.5 children per woman.

The global fertility rate as of 2015 was approximately 2.5 children per woman. This figure accounts for varying rates across different regions, with some areas having higher rates and others lower. The average is considered to be around 2.5, making option I the correct choice.

Answer: I
