Question:

An employment placement agency specializes in placing workers in jobs suited for them. From past experience, the agency knows that 20% of all the workers it places will no longer be at the position in which they were placed after one year; however, only 5% of those remaining after the first year leave during the next year. At the start of a year an employer hires 100 workers using this agency, then at the start of the next year the employer hires 100 more. How many of these 200 workers are expected to be on the job at the end of the second year?

Options:

A: 140
B: 160
C: 142
D: 144
E: 165
F: 155
G: 148
H: 156
I: 152
J: 150

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about workers being placed and their retention rates over two years. Let me read it again carefully to make sure I understand.

The setup is that an employment agency places workers, and from past experience, 20% of all workers leave their position after one year. But then, of those who remain after the first year, only 5% leave in the next year. 

The employer starts with hiring 100 workers at the beginning of the first year. Then, at the start of the next year, they hire another 100 workers. The question is asking how many of these 200 workers are expected to be on the job at the end of the second year.

Hmm, so we have two groups: the first group of 100 hired in year 1, and the second group of 100 hired in year 2. I need to calculate how many from each group are still there after two years.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, the first group: 100 workers hired at the start of year 1.

After the first year, 20% leave. So, 80% stay. That means 100 * 0.8 = 80 workers remain at the end of year 1.

Now, in the next year, which is year 2, 5% of those remaining leave. So, 5% of 80 is 4 workers. Therefore, 80 - 4 = 76 workers from the first group remain at the end of year 2.

Wait, no, actually, the problem says that only 5% of those remaining after the first year leave during the next year. So that's correct: 80 * 0.95 = 76.

Now, the second group: 100 workers hired at the start of year 2. Since they are hired at the start of the second year, they only have one year to possibly leave. So, at the end of year 2, which is the first year for this group, 20% leave. So, 100 * 0.8 = 80 workers remain.

Wait, but do they have a chance to leave in the next year? No, because the question is about the end of the second year. The second group was hired at the start of year 2, so they have only gone through their first year by the end of year 2. Therefore, 20% leave, leaving 80.

So the total number of workers remaining at the end of year 2 is the sum of the remaining from the first group and the second group: 76 + 80 = 156.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check. Because the first group was hired at the start of year 1, so they go through two years. The second group is hired at the start of year 2, so they only go through one year.

Yes, that's right. So first group: 100 -> 80 after year 1, then 76 after year 2. Second group: 100 -> 80 after year 1 (since they were placed at the start of year 2).

So total is 76 + 80 = 156. Looking at the options, H is 156. So the answer should be H.

The calculation involves determining the retention of two groups of workers over two years. The first group of 100 workers retains 80% after the first year and 95% of those remaining after the second year, resulting in 76 workers. The second group of 100 workers retains 80% after their first year, leaving 80 workers. Adding these gives a total of 156 workers.

Answer: H
