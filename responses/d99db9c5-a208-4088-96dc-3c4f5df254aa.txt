Okay, so I have this integral to compute: the integral of z squared times sine of (1/z) around the circle where the absolute value of z is 1. Hmm, that sounds like a complex analysis problem. I remember from my classes that when dealing with integrals around closed contours, especially in complex analysis, things like Cauchy's theorem or the residue theorem might come into play.

Wait, the integral is ∮_{|z|=1} z² sin(1/z) dz. Let me think about this. The function inside the integral is z² sin(1/z). First, I should check if this function is analytic inside and on the unit circle. But wait, sin(1/z) has a singularity at z=0 because as z approaches 0, 1/z goes to infinity, and sin(1/z) oscillates wildly. So the function isn't analytic at z=0, which is inside the unit circle. That means the function isn't entire, so Cauchy's theorem (which requires analyticity everywhere inside the contour) might not apply directly.

So, perhaps I should use the residue theorem instead. The residue theorem says that the integral around a closed contour is 2πi times the sum of residues inside the contour. But to use that, I need to find the residue of the function at z=0.

But wait, how do I find the residue of z² sin(1/z) at z=0? Let me recall that the residue is the coefficient of (1/z) in the Laurent series expansion around z=0.

So, first, I need to expand sin(1/z) in its Laurent series. I know that the Maclaurin series for sin(w) is w - w³/3! + w⁵/5! - w⁷/7! + ... So substituting w = 1/z, we get sin(1/z) = 1/z - 1/(3! z³) + 1/(5! z⁵) - 1/(7! z⁷) + ... and so on.

Now, multiply this by z². So, z² * sin(1/z) = z²*(1/z - 1/(3! z³) + 1/(5! z⁵) - ... ) Let's compute each term:

z²*(1/z) = z^(2-1) = z^1 = z.

z²*(-1/(3! z³)) = -z^(2-3) = -z^(-1) = -1/z.

z²*(1/(5! z⁵)) = z^(2-5) = z^(-3) = 1/z³.

Similarly, z²*(-1/(7! z⁷)) = -z^(2-7) = -z^(-5) = -1/z⁵.

So putting it all together, z² sin(1/z) = z - 1/(6 z) + 1/(120 z³) - 1/(5040 z⁵) + ... So the Laurent series expansion has terms with negative exponents.

Now, the residue is the coefficient of 1/z in this expansion. Looking at the series, the term with 1/z is -1/(6 z), so the coefficient is -1/6. Therefore, the residue at z=0 is -1/6.

Wait, but wait a second. The residue theorem says the integral is 2πi times the sum of residues inside the contour. Here, the only singularity inside |z|=1 is at z=0. So the integral should be 2πi * (-1/6) = -π i / 3 ≈ -1.047 i.

But the question says the answer is Ai, where i is the imaginary unit. So, A is the real coefficient in front of i. From my calculation, the integral is (-π/3) i, so A should be -π/3. Let me compute that numerically. π is approximately 3.1416, so π/3 is about 1.0472. So A is -1.0472, which would correspond to option A: -1.047.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I make any mistake in expanding the series or finding the residue?

Let me go through the steps again. The function is z² sin(1/z). Expanding sin(1/z) gives the series I wrote. Multiplying by z² shifts the exponents down by 2. So the 1/z term becomes z²*(1/z) = z, which is correct. The next term is -1/(3! z³) multiplied by z² gives -1/(6 z), correct. So the coefficient is -1/6, so the residue is -1/6. So the integral is 2πi*(-1/6) = -π i /3. So A is -π/3, which is approximately -1.047. So the answer should be option A.

The integral is computed using the residue theorem. The function has a singularity at z=0, so we find the residue there by expanding sin(1/z) and multiplying by z². The residue is -1/6, leading to an integral of -πi/3. Thus, A is approximately -1.047.
