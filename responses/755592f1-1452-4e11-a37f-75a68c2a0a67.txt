Okay, so I've got this question about Singer's argument in "All Animals Are Equal." I remember that Singer is a big name in animal rights and ethics. The question is asking which principle alone leads to the conclusions he makes in that essay. The options are from A to J, each a different principle.

First, I need to recall what the essay is about. Singer argues against speciesism, which is like a discrimination based on species, just as racism is based on race. He uses the principle of equal consideration, I think. So, he's saying that we shouldn't treat animals differently just because they're animals. 

Looking at the options, option B is the principle of equal consideration. That seems right because Singer emphasizes that equal consideration is the foundation. He talks about how we apply this principle to humans and should extend it to animals too. 

Option A is the "principal principle." I'm not exactly sure what that refers to. Maybe it's a term from another philosopher or a specific concept I'm not familiar with. I'll set that aside for now.

Option C is utilitarianism, which is about maximizing happiness. Singer does use some utilitarian arguments, but the question is about the principle that leads to the conclusions in the essay. While utilitarianism is part of his broader views, I think the specific principle he focuses on in this essay is equal consideration, not utilitarianism itself.

Option D is speciesism, which is the opposite of what Singer is arguing against. He's critiquing speciesism, so that's not the principle he's using to support his conclusions.

Option E is the principle of animal rights. That's a conclusion he might reach, but the question is about the underlying principle that leads there. So, it's probably not the answer.

Option F is the principle of double effect, which is more about justifying actions with both good and bad outcomes. Doesn't seem relevant here.

Option G is non-violence, which is more of a Gandhi principle, I think, not directly related to Singer's arguments here.

Option H is moral equality, which sounds similar to equal consideration but perhaps more focused on equality in moral status. Singer's argument is about considering interests equally, so maybe H is close, but I'm not sure if it's exactly the same as the principle he uses.

Option I is minimizing suffering, which is a part of his ethical stance, especially in utilitarian terms, but again, the main principle he's using to argue for equal treatment is equal consideration.

Option J is maximizing happiness, which is again a utilitarian concept, but not the specific principle Singer is using in this essay.

So, putting it together, the principle that leads to Singer's conclusions is the principle of equal consideration, which is option B. He argues that we must give equal weight to the interests of all beings, human and animal, when making moral decisions. This directly opposes speciesism and supports the idea that all animals should be considered equally in our moral evaluations.
