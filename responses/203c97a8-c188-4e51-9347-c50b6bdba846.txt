Okay, so I have this question about a resistor and voltage. Let me think through it step by step. The question says a 10-ohm resistor carries 10 amperes. I'm supposed to find the voltage across it. Hmm, I remember Ohm's Law from my studies. Ohm's Law is V = I * R, right? So voltage equals current multiplied by resistance.

Wait, so the current here is 10 A, and the resistance is 10 Ω. Let me plug those numbers into the formula. V equals 10 A times 10 Ω. That would be 100 volts. But wait, looking at the options, I don't see 100 V as an option. Let me check the options again.

The options are A to J. Let me list them out:

A: Exactly 20 V
B: Undefined
C: more than 0 but less than 10 V
D: Less than 0 V
E: Between 10 V and 20 V
F: more than 10 V
G: Greater than 20 V
H: There is no voltage across the resistor
I: 10 V
J: 0

Hmm, none of the options directly say 100 V. So maybe I made a mistake. Wait, did I calculate correctly? Ohm's Law is correct, right? V = I * R. So 10 A times 10 Ω is 100 V. But none of the options match that. Did I read the question wrong?

Wait, the question says the resistor "carries" 10 A. Carries might mean the current is 10 A. So that part is right. Oh, maybe I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me look again. Option G is "Greater than 20 V." So 100 V is definitely greater than 20 V. So the correct answer would be G.

But wait, none of the other options make sense. Let me think if there's any other possibility. Could the question be about something else? Like, maybe it's a trick question. Oh, but a resistor with current through it should have a voltage across it, so options H, J, D, etc., are out. Option B says undefined, but voltage is definitely defined here.

So yes, the calculation seems right. V=10*10=100 V, which is greater than 20 V. So the answer should be G.

The voltage across a 10-Ω resistor carrying 10 A can be calculated using Ohm's Law: \( V = I \times R \). Substituting the values, \( V = 10 \, \text{A} \times 10 \, \Omega = 100 \, \text{V} \). Among the given options, the only one that fits is "Greater than 20 V," which corresponds to option G.

Answer: G
