Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about a stone being thrown horizontally from a bridge and finding its total speed when it hits the water after 4 seconds. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with projectile motion, we can break things into horizontal and vertical components.

First, the stone is thrown horizontally, so the initial vertical velocity (vy) is zero. The horizontal velocity (vx) is given as 30 m/s. Since there's no air resistance, the horizontal velocity should remain constant, right? So vx stays at 30 m/s throughout the motion.

Now, the time it takes to fall is 4 seconds. I think that's the time it takes for the stone to drop vertically. I recall that the vertical motion is influenced by gravity, so I should calculate the vertical velocity when it hits the water. The formula for vertical velocity after time t is vy = u + at, where u is the initial velocity. Here, u is 0 because it's thrown horizontally, so vy = 0 + g*t. Wait, what's the acceleration due to gravity? I think it's approximately 9.8 m/s², but sometimes problems use 10 m/s² for simplicity. Let me check if the problem states that. Oh, it doesn't, so maybe I should use 9.8 m/s².

So vy = 9.8 m/s² * 4 s = 39.2 m/s. That's the vertical component of the velocity when it hits the water.

Now, the total speed when it enters the water is the vector sum of the horizontal and vertical components. Since these are perpendicular, I can use the Pythagorean theorem. The speed is sqrt(vx² + vy²).

Let me plug in the numbers:
vx = 30 m/s
vy = 39.2 m/s

So speed = sqrt(30² + 39.2²) = sqrt(900 + 1536.64) = sqrt(2436.64). Let me calculate that. Hmm, sqrt(2436.64) is approximately 49.36 m/s. Wait, that's around 49.36 m/s.

Looking at the options, I don't see 49.36. Let me check the options again. The choices are A:100, B:50, C:70, D:30, E:110, F:120, G:60, H:80, I:90, J:40. Oh, option B is 50, which is close to 49.36. Maybe I should consider using g as 10 m/s² instead because sometimes problems approximate it for simplicity.

If g is 10 m/s², then vy = 10 * 4 = 40 m/s. Then the speed would be sqrt(30² + 40²) = sqrt(900 + 1600) = sqrt(2500) = 50 m/s. That's exactly option B. So I think that's the intended answer because the problem might expect using g=10 m/s².

Wait, but why did I get 39.2 when using 9.8? Because 39.2 squared is about 1536.64, and 30 squared is 900, adding to 2436.64. The square root of that is about 49.36, which isn't an option. So maybe the problem expects us to approximate g as 10 m/s², making the vertical velocity 40 m/s, leading to a total speed of 50 m/s, which is option B.

To determine the stone's total speed when it enters the water, we analyze the horizontal and vertical components of its motion. The horizontal velocity remains constant at 30 m/s. The vertical velocity increases due to gravity, calculated as \( v_y = g \cdot t \). Assuming \( g = 10 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), the vertical velocity after 4 seconds is \( 40 \, \text{m/s} \). The total speed is the vector sum of these components, calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:

\[
\text{Speed} = \sqrt{(30)^2 + (40)^2} = \sqrt{2500} = 50 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is **B**.
