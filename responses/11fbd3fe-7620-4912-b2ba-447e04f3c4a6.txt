Okay, so I've got this question about fiscal policy and recessionary gaps. I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but let me try to work through this.

The question is asking about a drawback of using fiscal policy to close a recessionary gap. The options are A through D. First, I need to remember what a recessionary gap is. From what I recall, a recessionary gap occurs when the actual GDP is below the potential GDP, meaning the economy is in a recession. The goal of fiscal policy in this case would be to stimulate economic activity to bring GDP back up to its potential level.

Fiscal policy involves government spending and taxation. To close a recessionary gap, the government typically uses expansionary fiscal policy. That means increasing government spending and/or decreasing taxes. The idea is to boost aggregate demand, which should lead to increased output and employment.

Now, the question is about the drawbacks. So, what's a downside of using fiscal policy here? Let's look at the options one by one.

Option A: Unemployment will rise. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If the economy is in a recession, unemployment is already high. Expansionary fiscal policy aims to reduce unemployment by increasing economic activity. So A seems incorrect because the policy should help reduce unemployment, not cause it to rise.

Option B: Taxes will have to be raised. Hmm, no, that's not right either. Expansionary fiscal policy usually involves tax cuts, not increases. Raising taxes would actually reduce disposable income, leading to lower consumption and possibly making the recession worse. So B is probably not the answer.

Option C: The equilibrium price level will rise. That could happen, but is that a direct drawback? If the economy is in a recession, prices might be low, and increasing demand could lead to higher prices. But is that the main drawback? I'm not sure. It might be a side effect, but I don't recall this being the primary issue discussed in fiscal policy drawbacks.

Option D: Government spending on important programs will have to be cut. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Expansionary fiscal policy would mean increasing government spending, not cutting it. Cutting spending would be contractionary, which would worsen the recession. So D is the opposite of what expansionary policy does, making it incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It says a drawback of using fiscal policy. So perhaps the issue is that to increase spending, the government might have to cut elsewhere? Or maybe the problem is that if they rely too much on fiscal policy, they might have to raise taxes later to pay off the debt, which could slow down the economy again. But that's more of a long-term issue.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the crowding-out effect. When the government increases spending, it might borrow funds, which could drive up interest rates, reducing private investment. But that's not one of the options here.

Wait, looking back, the options again: the question is about a drawback. So, perhaps the main issue is that to fund the increased spending, the government might have to raise taxes in the future, which could reduce incentives and slow growth. But the option says "taxes will have to be raised," which might happen later, not necessarily immediately. But the question is about the immediate action of using fiscal policy.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that increasing spending or cutting taxes could lead to a higher budget deficit, which might cause concerns about government debt. But again, that's not one of the options.

Wait, let me think again. The question is about using fiscal policy to close a recessionary gap, and the drawback is one of the options. So, in the short term, to implement expansionary fiscal policy, the government might have to increase spending. But if they don't have the funds, they might issue debt, which could lead to higher taxes in the future. But the option B says taxes will have to be raised, which is a direct consequence.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that raising taxes would be a contractionary measure, which would counteract the expansion. But in the short term, for expansion, taxes are cut, not raised. So perhaps the correct answer is B, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up things. Let me recall: fiscal policy to close a recessionary gap is expansionary. So the government increases spending and/or cuts taxes. The immediate action doesn't require raising taxes; in fact, it's the opposite. So if the question is about a drawback, perhaps the issue is that raising taxes later to pay off the debt could be a problem, but that's not an immediate drawback.

Wait, another angle: maybe the question is referring to the fact that using fiscal policy can lead to higher government debt, which is a future liability. But that's not one of the options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the main drawback is that when the government increases spending, it might have to cut back on other programs to fund it, but that's not what D says. D says government spending on important programs will have to be cut, which would be contractionary, so that's not part of expansionary fiscal policy.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option again.

Option A: Unemployment will rise. No, expansionary policy should reduce unemployment.

Option B: Taxes will have to be raised. Expansionary policy usually cuts taxes, so this seems incorrect unless it's a long-term consequence.

Option C: Equilibrium price level will rise. That's possible due to increased demand, but is it a drawback? It might be inflation, which can be a problem, but is that the main issue with fiscal policy in this context?

Option D: Government spending on important programs will have to be cut. That's contractionary, so it's not a consequence of using fiscal policy to close the gap.

Wait, maybe the question is about the limitation of fiscal policy. For example, if the government increases spending, it might lead to higher prices. So C could be the answer. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the main drawback is that it can lead to a higher budget deficit, but again, that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about what each option represents.

The question is about a drawback. So, using fiscal policy (expansionary) to close a recessionary gap. The options are possible drawbacks.

A: Unemployment rises. No, because expansionary policy should reduce unemployment.

B: Taxes will have to be raised. Wait, no, because expansionary policy involves tax cuts. So raising taxes would be contractionary, which is the opposite of what's being done. Unless the question is implying that to fund the higher spending, taxes might need to be raised later, but that's a long-term issue.

C: Equilibrium price level will rise. That's a possible outcome, but is it a drawback? In a recession, prices might be too low, so raising them could be a good thing. But if it's excessive, it could lead to inflation, which is a problem. So maybe C is a drawback.

D: Government spending on important programs will have to be cut. No, because expansionary policy increases spending, not cuts it.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is C.

Wait, thinking again, when the government increases spending or cuts taxes, it can lead to an increase in aggregate demand, shifting the AD curve to the right. This can cause the equilibrium price level to rise, which is option C. So that's a possible drawback because it can lead to inflation.

But I'm not sure if that's the primary drawback. Another possible drawback is that if the government increases spending, it might have to borrow, leading to higher interest rates (crowding out), but that's not an option here.

Alternatively, if the government raises taxes to fund the spending, that's a direct tax increase, which is option B. But in expansionary fiscal policy, taxes are cut, not raised. So perhaps the question is about a possible future action, but the immediate action is to cut taxes.

Wait, maybe the question is more about the limitation of fiscal policy. Like, when using fiscal policy, the government might have to cut other programs to fund the expansion. But that's not exactly what D says. D says government spending on important programs will have to be cut, which would be contractionary, so that's not part of expansionary fiscal policy.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of it differently. What are the common drawbacks of expansionary fiscal policy?

1. It can lead to higher budget deficits and national debt.
2. It might cause inflation if aggregate demand increases too much.
3. It could lead to higher interest rates due to crowding out.

Looking at the options, option C is about the equilibrium price level rising, which relates to inflation. So that's a possible drawback.

Alternatively, if the government increases spending, it might have to cut elsewhere, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, another thought: maybe the question is about the fact that using fiscal policy can lead to higher taxes in the future to pay off the debt. But the option says taxes will have to be raised, which could be a future consequence, but it's not an immediate drawback of using fiscal policy now.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B, but I'm not sure. I'm a bit confused because I thought expansionary fiscal policy involves tax cuts, not increases.

Wait, maybe the question is a bit of a trick. It says "using fiscal policy to close a recessionary gap," which would involve expansionary measures. The drawback is that taxes will have to be raised. But that's not the case because raising taxes is contractionary. So perhaps the answer is not B.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of each option again.

A: Unemployment will rise. No, because expansionary policy reduces unemployment.

B: Taxes will have to be raised. No, because expansionary policy cuts taxes.

C: The equilibrium price level will rise. Yes, this can happen as a result of increased demand, leading to inflation.

D: Government spending on important programs will have to be cut. No, because expansionary policy increases spending.

So the correct answer must be C. The equilibrium price level will rise.

The question asks about a drawback of using fiscal policy to close a recessionary gap. To address this, it is important to understand that fiscal policy in this context involves expansionary measures, such as increasing government spending or cutting taxes, to stimulate economic activity and reduce unemployment. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Unemployment will rise. This is incorrect because expansionary fiscal policy aims to reduce unemployment, not increase it.
- **Option B**: Taxes will have to be raised. This is also incorrect because expansionary fiscal policy typically involves tax cuts, not increases. While raising taxes could be a future consequence to address debt, it is not an immediate drawback of using fiscal policy to close a recessionary gap.
- **Option C**: The equilibrium price level will rise. This is plausible because increasing aggregate demand through fiscal policy can lead to higher prices, potentially causing inflation, which is a recognized drawback.
- **Option D**: Government spending on important programs will have to be cut. This is incorrect because expansionary fiscal policy increases spending, not cuts it.

The most accurate answer is **C**, as the equilibrium price level rising is a valid drawback of using fiscal policy to close a recessionary gap.

Answer: C
