Okay, so I have this problem where an object's velocity is given by v(t) = t cos(t) - ln(t + 2), and I need to find out how many times the object reverses direction between t=0 and t=10. The options are from A to J, with numbers like two, six, four, etc., or none.

Hmm, reversing direction usually means the velocity changes sign. So, if the velocity goes from positive to negative or vice versa, that's a reversal. So I need to find how many times v(t) crosses zero in this interval. Each crossing would indicate a change in direction.

Wait, but I should be careful because sometimes the velocity might touch zero but not cross it, which doesn't count as a reversal. So only the actual sign changes matter.

So, first, I think I should find the points where v(t) = 0 between 0 and 10. That means solving t cos(t) - ln(t + 2) = 0. Hmm, that seems tricky because it's a transcendental equation and might not have an analytical solution. So probably, I'll need to use numerical methods or graphing to estimate the roots.

Alternatively, maybe analyzing the behavior of v(t) can help. Let's think about the components: t cos(t) and ln(t + 2). The first term, t cos(t), oscillates because cos(t) is periodic, but it's multiplied by t, so the amplitude increases over time. The second term, ln(t + 2), grows slowly as t increases.

So, v(t) is the difference between an oscillating function with increasing amplitude and a slowly increasing logarithmic function. That suggests that as t increases, the oscillations might become more significant compared to the ln term, but the ln term is always positive and increasing.

Let me think about when t is close to 0. At t=0, cos(0)=1, so the first term is 0*1=0. The second term is ln(2) ≈ 0.693. So v(0) = 0 - 0.693 ≈ -0.693, which is negative.

As t increases, let's see what happens. The t cos(t) term will oscillate between positive and negative values, but with increasing magnitude. The ln(t+2) is always positive and increasing, though.

So, for the velocity to reverse direction, v(t) must cross zero from negative to positive or positive to negative.

I think the best approach is to evaluate v(t) at several points to see when it crosses zero.

Let me try some t values:

t=0: v(0) ≈ -0.693 (negative)

t=1: cos(1) ≈ 0.5403, so 1*0.5403 ≈ 0.5403. ln(3) ≈ 1.0986. So v(1) ≈ 0.5403 - 1.0986 ≈ -0.5583 (still negative)

t=2: cos(2) ≈ -0.4161, so 2*(-0.4161) ≈ -0.8322. ln(4) ≈ 1.3863. v(2) ≈ -0.8322 - 1.3863 ≈ -2.2185 (more negative)

Wait, but that seems to be getting more negative. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake because cos(2) is negative, so t cos(t) is negative, and then subtracting a positive ln. So yeah, it's getting more negative.

Wait, but maybe I should check higher t when cos(t) is positive again. Let's try t=π/2 ≈ 1.5708. cos(1.5708) is about 0, so v(t) would be small. Let's compute more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should make a table of t from 0 to 10 and compute v(t). But that's time-consuming, so maybe I can think of the zeros.

Alternatively, I can think about the derivative of v(t) to see where it's increasing or decreasing, but maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, using the Intermediate Value Theorem to find intervals where v(t) changes sign.

Wait, but perhaps I can plot the function or think about its behavior.

Let me try evaluating v(t) at several points:

t=0: v(0) ≈ -0.6931 (negative)

t=1: v(1) ≈ 1*0.5403 - ln(3) ≈ 0.5403 - 1.0986 ≈ -0.5583 (negative)

t=2: 2*cos(2) ≈ 2*(-0.4161) ≈ -0.8322. ln(4) ≈ 1.3863. So v(2) ≈ -0.8322 - 1.3863 ≈ -2.2185 (still negative)

t=3: cos(3) ≈ -0.98999. So 3*(-0.98999) ≈ -2.96997. ln(5) ≈ 1.6094. v(3) ≈ -2.96997 - 1.6094 ≈ -4.5794 (more negative)

t=4: cos(4) ≈ -0.6536. 4*(-0.6536) ≈ -2.6144. ln(6) ≈ 1.7918. v(4) ≈ -2.6144 - 1.7918 ≈ -4.4062 (still negative)

t=5: cos(5) ≈ 0.28366. So 5*0.28366 ≈ 1.4183. ln(7) ≈ 1.9459. v(5) ≈ 1.4183 - 1.9459 ≈ -0.5276 (still negative)

t=6: cos(6) ≈ 0.96017. 6*0.96017 ≈ 5.761. ln(8) ≈ 2.0794. v(6) ≈ 5.761 - 2.0794 ≈ 3.6816 (positive)

So between t=5 and t=6, v(t) goes from negative to positive. So that's one reversal.

Wait, but wait, at t=5, v(t) is negative, and at t=6, positive. So that's a sign change, so one reversal.

Continue:

t=7: cos(7) ≈ 0.7539. 7*0.7539 ≈ 5.2773. ln(9) ≈ 2.1972. v(7) ≈5.2773 - 2.1972 ≈3.0801 (positive)

t=8: cos(8) ≈ -0.1455. 8*(-0.1455) ≈-1.164. ln(10)≈2.3026. v(8)≈-1.164 -2.3026≈-3.4666 (negative)

So between t=7 and t=8, v(t) goes from positive to negative. That's another reversal. So now two reversals.

t=9: cos(9) ≈ 0.9111. 9*0.9111≈8.2. ln(11)≈2.3979. v(9)=8.2 -2.3979≈5.8021 (positive)

t=10: cos(10)≈-0.8391. 10*(-0.8391)= -8.391. ln(12)≈2.4849. v(10)= -8.391 -2.4849≈-10.8759 (negative)

So between t=9 and t=10, v(t) goes from positive to negative. That's a third reversal.

Wait, but let's check if there are any other crossings between these points.

Wait, between t=5 and t=6, it goes from negative to positive. So that's one.

Between t=6 and t=7, v(t) is positive at both ends. So no crossing there.

Between t=7 and t=8, from positive to negative: second reversal.

Between t=8 and t=9: t=8 is negative, t=9 is positive. So that's a third reversal.

Between t=9 and t=10: from positive to negative, fourth reversal.

Wait, so that's four reversals? But wait, let me check the actual values again.

Wait, let me make a more detailed table.

t | v(t)
0 | -0.6931 (negative)
1 | -0.5583 (negative)
2 | -2.2185 (negative)
3 | -4.5794 (negative)
4 | -4.4062 (negative)
5 | -0.5276 (negative)
6 | 3.6816 (positive)
7 | 3.0801 (positive)
8 | -3.4666 (negative)
9 | 5.8021 (positive)
10 | -10.8759 (negative)

From the table:

Between t=5 and t=6: negative to positive (1 reversal)
Between t=6 and t=7: remains positive
Between t=7 and t=8: positive to negative (2nd reversal)
Between t=8 and t=9: negative to positive (3rd reversal)
Between t=9 and t=10: positive to negative (4th reversal)

So that's four reversals. So the answer should be option C: four.

Wait, but let me check if there are any other crossings within these intervals. For example, between t=5 and t=6, v(t) goes from negative to positive. Maybe only once. Similarly, between t=8 and t=9, from negative to positive, that's one reversal.

Wait, but perhaps between t=0 and t=5, does v(t) cross zero any other times? Because from t=0 to t=5, it's always negative except at t=5 where it's still negative. So no crossing there.

Wait, another point: between t=5 and t=6, v(t) goes from -0.5276 to +3.6816, so that's one crossing.

Between t=6 and t=7, stays positive.

t=7 to t=8: from positive to negative, so another crossing.

t=8 to t=9: negative to positive, another crossing.

t=9 to t=10: positive to negative, another crossing.

So that's four crossings, meaning four reversals.

Wait, so the answer is C: four.

To determine how many times the object reverses direction, we analyze the velocity function \( v(t) = t \cos(t) - \ln(t + 2) \) over the interval \( 0 \leq t \leq 10 \). Reversals occur when \( v(t) \) changes sign, indicating a change from positive to negative or vice versa.

1. **Behavior of \( v(t) \):**
   - \( t \cos(t) \) oscillates with increasing amplitude due to the \( t \) term.
   - \( \ln(t + 2) \) grows slowly and is always positive.

2. **Key Points Evaluated:**
   - At \( t = 0 \): \( v(0) \approx -0.6931 \) (negative).
   - At \( t = 1 \): \( v(1) \approx -0.5583 \) (negative).
   - At \( t = 2 \): \( v(2) \approx -2.2185 \) (negative).
   - At \( t = 3 \): \( v(3) \approx -4.5794 \) (negative).
   - At \( t = 4 \): \( v(4) \approx -4.4062 \) (negative).
   - At \( t = 5 \): \( v(5) \approx -0.5276 \) (negative).
   - At \( t = 6 \): \( v(6) \approx 3.6816 \) (positive).
   - At \( t = 7 \): \( v(7) \approx 3.0801 \) (positive).
   - At \( t = 8 \): \( v(8) \approx -3.4666 \) (negative).
   - At \( t = 9 \): \( v(9) \approx 5.8021 \) (positive).
   - At \( t = 10 \): \( v(10) \approx -10.8759 \) (negative).

3. **Sign Changes and Reversals:**
   - Between \( t = 5 \) and \( t = 6 \): Negative to positive (1 reversal).
   - Between \( t = 7 \) and \( t = 8 \): Positive to negative (2nd reversal).
   - Between \( t = 8 \) and \( t = 9 \): Negative to positive (3rd reversal).
   - Between \( t = 9 \) and \( t = 10 \): Positive to negative (4th reversal).

Thus, the object reverses direction **four times**.

**Answer: C**
