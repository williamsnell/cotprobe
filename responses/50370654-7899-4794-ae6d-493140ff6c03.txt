Question:

Assume this question takes place in a "lien theory" state. A woman and her co-habiting partner share a property as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. He has run up debts that he did not tell her about, and so he uses his interest in the property to secretly get a mortgage from the bank. When he dies, the bank attempts to execute on the mortgage. Can it do so? Apply the majority view on this issue.

Options:

A: No, the mortgage lien could not destroy the joint tenancy, and when the partner dies, the property passes by operation of law to the surviving joint tenant.
B: No, although the mortgage destroyed the joint tenancy, the bank has to get a deed of trust in order to execute on jointly owned property.
C: Yes, the bank got title to the property by virtue of the mortgage, which destroyed the joint tenancy, and it can execute on its lien.
D: Yes, the mortgage was the equivalent of a deed of trust and the joint tenancy was severed by the mortgage lien, giving the bank unfettered legal authority to execute on its mortgage.

Okay, so I have this question about property law, specifically dealing with joint tenancy and mortgages. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the question is set in a "lien theory" state. I remember that there are two main theories in mortgage law: title theory and lien theory. In title theory states, the mortgage conveys legal title of the property to the mortgagee (the lender), while the borrower retains equitable title. In lien theory states, the borrower keeps legal title, and the mortgage is considered a lien on the property. So, in this case, since it's a lien theory state, the bank has a lien on the property but doesn't own the title.

The scenario is about a woman and her co-habiting partner who own a property as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. The partner took out a mortgage without telling her and used his interest in the property. Now, when he dies, the bank is trying to execute on the mortgage. The question is whether the bank can do so.

Joint tenancy with the right of survivorship means that when one tenant dies, the surviving tenant automatically gets the deceased's interest. So, in this case, the woman would take the entire property upon her partner's death, right? But the partner had a mortgage on his interest.

I think the key here is whether the mortgage affects the joint tenancy. In title theory states, the mortgage would transfer legal title, which might sever the joint tenancy because each joint tenant needs to have an undivided interest. But in lien theory, the mortgage is just a lien, so the borrower keeps legal title. Does a lien affect the joint tenancy?

I recall that in some cases, a mortgage can sever a joint tenancy. If one tenant mortgages their interest, it could be seen as an encumbrance that affects the joint tenancy. But in lien theory states, since the mortgage is a lien and not a transfer of title, maybe it doesn't sever the joint tenancy. Or does it? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the majority view on this issue is important. From what I remember, the majority view is that a mortgage by one joint tenant does not sever the joint tenancy. Because under the lien theory, the mortgage doesn't transfer title, so the other joint tenant's interest isn't affected. Therefore, when the mortgagor (the partner) dies, the mortgage lien remains attached to his interest, but the survivorship right would pass the property to the woman, leaving the bank with a claim against the deceased's estate, not the property itself.

Looking at the options:

A: No, the mortgage lien couldn't destroy the joint tenancy, so the property passes to the survivor. This seems to align with the majority view I just considered.

B: No, but the bank needs a deed of trust. I don't think this is right because in lien theory, a deed of trust isn't necessary; the mortgage is sufficient as a lien.

C: Yes, the bank got title by the mortgage, which destroyed the joint tenancy. But wait, in lien theory, the bank doesn't get title. So this might be incorrect.

D: Yes, the mortgage was like a deed of trust, severing the joint tenancy. Again, in lien theory, the mortgage isn't a conveyance of title, so this seems off.

So, the correct answer should be A. The mortgage lien doesn't destroy the joint tenancy, and upon the partner's death, the property goes to the surviving woman.

The question involves a lien theory state where a woman and her partner own property as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. The partner took out a mortgage without the woman's knowledge, and the bank now seeks to execute on the mortgage after his death. In a lien theory state, the mortgage is considered a lien on the property, not a transfer of title. 

The majority view holds that a mortgage by one joint tenant does not sever the joint tenancy because the lien does not affect the survivorship right. When the partner dies, the property passes to the surviving woman by operation of law, and the bank's lien cannot attach to the property itself but may pursue claims against the deceased's estate.

Answer: A
