Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a racing car. Let me see if I can figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the kinematics, but I'll try to work through it.

Alright, the problem says a racing car passes one end of the grandstand at 50 ft/sec and then slows down with a constant acceleration. When it passes the other end, its speed is 10 ft/sec. The whole process takes 20 seconds. I need to find the acceleration and the length of the grandstand.

Hmm, so part (a) is asking for acceleration, and part (b) is the length. Let me tackle them one at a time.

First, for acceleration. I remember that acceleration is the change in velocity over time. Since the car is slowing down, the acceleration should be negative. So the formula for acceleration is a = (v_final - v_initial)/time.

Let me plug in the numbers. The initial velocity, v_initial, is 50 ft/sec, and the final velocity, v_final, is 10 ft/sec. The time taken is 20 seconds.

So a = (10 - 50) / 20. Let me calculate that: 10 minus 50 is -40, divided by 20 is -2 ft/sec². Okay, so acceleration is -2 ft/s². That's part (a) done.

Now, part (b) is the length of the grandstand, which I think is the distance the car travels in those 20 seconds. I remember the formula for distance when acceleration is constant. It's something like s = ut + (1/2)at², where u is initial velocity, t is time, and a is acceleration.

Wait, let me make sure. The formula is s = v_initial * t + 0.5 * a * t². Yeah, that sounds right.

Plugging in the numbers: v_initial is 50 ft/s, t is 20 s, a is -2 ft/s².

So s = 50*20 + 0.5*(-2)*(20)^2.

Let me calculate each part. 50*20 is 1000. Then, 0.5*(-2) is -1, and 20 squared is 400. So 0.5*(-2)*400 is -1*400 = -400.

So s = 1000 - 400 = 600 ft. Wait, but wait a second, that doesn't seem right because when I look at the options, some have 500 ft, others 600, etc.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the formula. Alternatively, I can use another formula for distance when initial and final velocities are known. The formula is s = (v_initial + v_final)/2 * time.

Let me try that. So (50 + 10)/2 = 60/2 = 30. Then, 30 * 20 = 600 ft. Same answer as before. So the length is 600 ft.

Looking back at the options, which one has acceleration -2 ft/s² and length 600 ft? Let me check the options.

Option C: Acceleration -2 ft/s², length 500 ft.
Option G: Acceleration -2 ft/s², length 600 ft.
Option H: Acceleration -2 ft/s², length 700 ft.

So the correct one would be option G, right? Because acceleration is -2 and length is 600. Wait, but wait, did I do the calculations correctly?

Wait, in the first method, I used s = ut + 0.5 a t². So 50*20 is 1000, 0.5*(-2)*400 is -400. 1000 -400 is 600. Correct.

In the second method, average velocity is (50+10)/2=30, times 20 is 600. Yep, same result.

So the length is 600 ft, acceleration is -2 ft/s². So the answer should be option G.
</think>

The racing car decelerates from 50 ft/s to 10 ft/s over 20 seconds. Using the formula for acceleration, \( a = \frac{v_f - v_i}{t} \), we find \( a = \frac{10 - 50}{20} = -2 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \). For the grandstand length, using the formula \( s = v_i t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2 \), we calculate \( s = 50 \times 20 + 0.5 \times (-2) \times 20^2 = 600 \, \text{ft} \). Thus, the correct option is G.

Answer: G
