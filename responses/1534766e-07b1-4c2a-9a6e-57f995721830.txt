Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about how the royal cemeteries of the Moche were discovered. I'm not super familiar with the Moche civilization, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the question gives me options from A to J. I'll go through each option and see which one makes the most sense.

Option A says a forest fire burned away the vegetation. That seems a bit unlikely. I mean, forest fires can reveal things, but I'm not sure if that's how the Moche cemeteries were found.

Option B mentions thieves raiding tombs and getting caught. While treasure hunters and looters are common in archaeology, I'm not sure if they were the ones who first discovered the cemeteries. They might have dug up tombs, but the initial discovery is probably by someone else.

Option C says archaeologists found an exact replica in the map room. That sounds too fictional, like from a movie or a story. I don't think real archaeology works that way.

Option D suggests a massive earthquake revealed the tombs. Earthquakes can cause landslides or shift earth, uncovering things. But I'm not too sure about this method specifically for Moche sites.

Option E is about sheep falling into a tomb. That's a funny image, but I don't recall any historical cases where sheep led to such a discovery. It seems more like a myth or joke.

Option F says a local farmer found the tombs while tilling. That sounds plausible. In many ancient sites, especially in areas where people have been farming for a long time, farmers often stumble upon artifacts or structures while working their land. It's a common way for sites to be discovered.

Option G talks about local legends leading archaeologists to the spot. Some sites are indeed found because of myths or legends. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. I think the Moche sites might have been found through more direct means.

Option H mentions a drought causing water levels to drop. That could expose things underwater or in wet areas. But if the cemeteries were on land, maybe this isn't it.

Option I says they were found during a government-funded expedition. That's possible, as many digs are funded by governments or universities. But the question is about how they were discovered, not who funded it. So this might be more about the method rather than the initial find.

Option J suggests they were found during a construction project. Accidental discoveries during building are common. For example, when digging foundations or roads, historical sites are often uncovered. This could be a strong contender.

So, I'm thinking between F and J. Farmers tilling or construction projects. I remember hearing that many ancient sites in Peru, like the Moche, have been found when people were working the land or building something nearby. For instance, the famous site of Huacas de Moche was discovered during construction work on a highway, if I'm not mistaken. So that would point to option J.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: sometimes, farmers usingmachines might dig up something, but in the case of the Moche, I think the discovery was more accidental, perhaps during construction. Alternatively, maybe a farmer found something unusual and reported it, leading to an official dig. But the question is about how the cemeteries were discovered, so if it was during a construction project, that's option J.

Alternatively, if it was a farmer while tilling, that's F. I'm a bit confused now. But I think the more common scenario for such discoveries is during construction. So I'll go with J.

The correct answer is J: The cemeteries were accidentally discovered during a construction project.
