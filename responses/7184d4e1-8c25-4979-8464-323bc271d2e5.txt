Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about property law, specifically dealing with mortgages and deeds. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question involves a woman who mortgaged her land back in 1993 to a mortgage company. The mortgage was to secure a note for $25,000, due by December 31, 1993, with 9.5% interest. So, this is a mortgage, which is a type of lien on the property as security for the loan. Typically, when you take out a mortgage, the lender records it immediately, but in this case, the mortgage company recorded it in 1996, which is three years after the mortgage was created. That's something to note because recording times can affect priority of claims.

Then, in 2007, the woman signed a writing where she promised to convey the tract of land to her daughter by quitclaim deed and to pay the mortgage debt when it came due. A quitclaim deed is a type of deed that transfers whatever interest the grantor has in the property, without any warranties. Importantly, it doesn't transfer any rights related to the mortgage unless specified. In this case, the writing says she'll pay the mortgage debt when it comes due. So she's promising to pay, but she hasn't transferred the property yet.

In 2008, she delivered the quitclaim deed to her daughter, but the deed made no reference to the mortgage. So, the daughter now has the deed, but the mortgage is still in place. The question is, if the woman defaults on the mortgage debt, who can sue her?

Let me think about the law here. In a mortgage scenario, the mortgage company has a lien on the property. The woman (grantor) is the mortgagor, and the mortgage company is the mortgagee. When she executed the quitclaim deed in 2008, she's transferring her interest in the property to her daughter. But since it's a quitclaim, she doesn't guarantee clear title, and the mortgage isn't extinguished by the transfer. The mortgage would still be a lien on the property, but now the daughter holds the equitable title, assuming she didn't take it subject to the mortgage.

Wait, but when a mortgagor transfers the property, does the mortgage pass to the grantee? Typically, a mortgage is a lien on the property, so if the property is sold or transferred, the lien remains. But if the mortgage was not properly recorded before the transfer, it might affect the priority. Here, the mortgage was recorded in 1996, which is before the transfer in 2008, so the mortgage is a valid lien on the property.

But when the woman conveyed the property via quitclaim, she's only transferring her interest. Since the mortgage was a lien, it's still on the property. So the daughter now owns the property subject to the mortgage. That means if the woman defaults, the mortgage company can foreclose on the property, but the daughter would have an interest as the owner. However, the daughter didn't assume the mortgage; she didn't agree to pay it. The woman had promised in 2007 to pay the mortgage when it came due, but did she actually pay it?

Wait, in 2007, she promised to pay the debt when it came due, but in 2008, she delivered the deed. Now, if the mortgage was due in 1993, but she's still paying it? Or maybe it's a different due date? Let me check the facts again. Oh, the note was due in 1993, but she's still alive, so perhaps the note was extended or has different terms. The key is that the mortgage company hasn't foreclosed yet, and then the woman defaults.

So, when the woman defaulted on the mortgage, the mortgage company would likely foreclose on the property. But the daughter now holds the quitclaim deed. Under the mortgage law, when a mortgagor transfers the property, the mortgagee (lender) can foreclose and the proceeds would go to pay off the mortgage, with any surplus going to the mortgagor or the current owner. But if the transfer was a quitclaim, and the daughter didn't take subject to the mortgage, then the daughter might have an interest that could be affected by the foreclosure.

Alternatively, the daughter might have a claim against the mother for breach of the promise to pay the mortgage. In 2007, the woman promised in writing to convey the land and pay the mortgage when it came due. So that's a contract. If the mortgage comes due, and the woman fails to pay, the daughter could sue her for breach of contract because the woman failed to fulfill her promise to pay the debt.

But wait, when the woman delivered the deed, she transferred her interest, but the mortgage was still in place. So if the mortgage company forecloses, they could take the property, and the daughter's interest would be wiped out unless she had some rights. But the daughter took the property subject to the mortgage because she didn't assume it. Alternatively, if the mother promised to pay the debt, then the mother is still liable on the mortgage note. The daughter isn't a party to the mortgage, so the mortgage company can't sue the daughter for the debt.

So, if the woman defaults, the mortgage company can sue her because she's the one who took the loan. The daughter, on the other hand, since she received the deed, might have a claim against her mother for the loss of the property due to foreclosure because the mother promised to pay the mortgage. So the daughter could sue the mother for breach of contract.

Looking at the answer options:

A: Mortgage company can sue both woman and daughter. That's not right because the daughter isn't liable on the mortgage.

B: Daughter can sue mortgage company. No, because the mortgage company isn't obligated to the daughter unless the daughter took the property free of the mortgage, which she didn't.

C: Neither has a claim. No, because the mortgage company can sue the woman, and the daughter can sue the woman.

D: Only the mortgage company can sue the woman. That can't be right because the daughter also has a claim.

E: Both have causes against the woman. That seems possible.

F: Woman can sue mortgage company. Unlikely, unless there's a breach by the mortgage company, which isn't indicated.

G: Both mortgage company and daughter share a cause. Maybe, but they have separate causes.

H: Only daughter can sue. No.

I: Both woman and daughter can sue mortgage company. No.

J: Woman can sue daughter. No.

So the correct answer is E: Both the daughter and the mortgage company have causes of action against the woman. Because the mortgage company can foreclose for the default, and the daughter can sue for breach of the 2007 agreement.

The woman mortgaged her land in 1993 and recorded the mortgage in 1996. In 2007, she promised to convey the land to her daughter via quitclaim deed and pay the mortgage debt. In 2008, she delivered the deed, which didn’t reference the mortgage. If she defaults, the mortgage company can foreclose, and the daughter can sue for breach of contract. Thus, both have causes of action.

Answer: E
