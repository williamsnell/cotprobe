Okay, so I have to figure out how many centimeters the cervix must dilate before a baby can be born. I remember from school that the cervix dilates during labor, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact number. Let me think. I think the process is called cervical dilation, right? So the cervix starts closed and then opens up to allow the baby to pass through.

I recall that the cervix needs to dilate completely for the baby to come out. I'm pretty sure the measurement is in centimeters. Maybe around 10 cm? I think that's the standard, but wait, sometimes I've heard people talk about being 3 cm dilated or something like that during early labor. But the full dilation must be more than that.

Wait, no, the full dilation is when the cervix is completely open, which is 10 centimeters. Because the baby's head needs to pass through, and the average diameter of a baby's head is about 10 cm. So yeah, the cervix has to dilate to 10 cm for the baby to be born.

Looking at the options, H is 10. So the answer should be H.
