Question:

In Python 3, what is the output of ['Hi!'] * 4?

Options:

A: ['Hi!', 4]
B: ['Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!']
C: 4 * ['Hi!']
D: ['Hi!4']
E: Error
F: ['Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!']
G: ['Hi!Hi!Hi!Hi!']
H: ['Hi!'] * 4
I: ['Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!']
J: None of the above.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what the output of ['Hi!'] * 4 is in Python 3. I'm a bit new to Python, but I remember that multiplying a list by a number repeats the elements. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I know that in Python, when you multiply a list by an integer, it concatenates the list that many times. For example, [1] * 3 would give [1, 1, 1]. So applying that logic here, ['Hi!'] is a list with one element. Multiplying it by 4 should repeat that element four times, right?

Let me visualize this. The original list is ['Hi!']. So when you multiply by 4, it's like adding the list to itself four times. Wait, no, actually, it's the same as the list multiplied by the number. So ['Hi!'] * 4 would be ['Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!'], because each multiplication adds another 'Hi!' four times.

Looking at the options, option F is ['Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!'], which matches what I'm thinking. Option B has five 'Hi!'s, so that's probably wrong. Option G has all the strings concatenated into one, which isn't the case here because we're dealing with a list.

Wait, could there be any other possibilities? Let me check the other options. Option A is ['Hi!',4], which doesn't make sense because you can't multiply a list by a number and have the number itself in the list. Option C is 4 * ['Hi!'], which is the same as ['Hi!'] *4, but in Python, multiplication is commutative for numbers and iterables. So 4 * ['Hi!'] would result in the same as the original expression, but the question is about the output of the given expression, not the input. So the output would be a list, and option C is written as 4 * ['Hi!'], which is another way but the output would be the same as F.

Wait, but the question is about what the output is, not about the expression itself. So the output would be F. Option H is written as ['Hi!'] *4, which is the same as the input, but that's the code, not the output. The output would be the list after evaluation.

So looking back, the correct output should be a list with four 'Hi!' elements. So option F is correct.

The output of `['Hi!'] * 4` in Python 3 is a list with the string 'Hi!' repeated four times. This is because multiplying a list by an integer in Python repeats the elements of the list that many times. Therefore, the correct answer is option F: `['Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!']`.

The other options can be ruled out as follows:
- Option A: Incorrect because it includes the number 4 in the list.
- Option B: Incorrect because it has five elements.
- Option C: Represents the same operation but is the input, not the output.
- Option D: Incorrect because it concatenates the string.
- Option E: No error occurs.
- Option G: Incorrect because it concatenates the string into one element.
- Option H: Represents the input, not the output.
- Option I: Incorrect because it has eight elements.
- Option J: Not applicable since option F is correct.

Thus, the correct answer is F.

F
