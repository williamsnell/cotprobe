Question:

A 70-year-old woman comes to the office because of worsening tremor of her hands. The tremor has been present for most of her life and initially was mild and would occur only when she was tired or stressed. During the past month the shaking has become more noticeable and frequent. She is now embarrassed to eat with other people because of how obvious the tremor has become. The patient has been taking fluoxetine for the past 3 weeks to help her to cope with the death of her husband 2 months ago. Medical history is also remarkable for essential hypertension controlled with lisinopril and hyperlipidemia controlled with atorvastatin. Her only other medication is occasional ibuprofen for joint pain. She used to drink one to two alcoholic beverages monthly but now drinks one glass of wine daily because, she says, it reduces her tremor. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (155 lb); BMI is 25 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 36.4°C (97.6°F), pulse 80/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 130/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a moderate tremor of both hands that is not present at rest. Complete blood count, serum chemistry profile, and serum thyroid function tests are ordered and results are pending. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's worsening tremor?

Options:

A: Early Parkinson disease
B: Adverse effect of fluoxetine therapy
C: Adverse effect of atorvastatin therapy
D: Adverse effect of ibuprofen therapy
E: Increase in alcohol consumption
F: Hyperthyroidism
G: Bereavement reaction
H: Adverse effect of lisinopril therapy
I: Essential tremor exacerbated by stress
J: Onset of multiple sclerosis

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this medical question. Let me read through the case carefully.

The patient is a 70-year-old woman with worsening tremors. The tremor started when she was younger, mild and only when tired or stressed. Now, after a month, it's more noticeable and frequent. She's embarrassed to eat with others because of it.

Her medications include fluoxetine for the past 3 weeks, which she started after her husband's death two months ago. She also has hypertension controlled with lisinopril and hyperlipidemia with atorvastatin. She uses occasional ibuprofen for joint pain. She used to drink one or two alcoholic beverages monthly but now drinks a glass of wine daily, saying it helps her tremor.

Her vitals are normal except for a slightly elevated blood pressure. The physical exam shows a moderate tremor in both hands, not present at rest. Blood tests are pending.

The question is asking for the most likely cause of her worsening tremor. The options are from A to J.

Let me go through each option.

Option A: Early Parkinson disease. Parkinsonian tremors are typically rest tremors, meaning they're present when the hands are at rest. In the case, the tremor isn't present at rest, so maybe not Parkinson's. Also, her tremor started earlier in life, which is more typical for essential tremor.

Option B: Adverse effect of fluoxetine. Fluoxetine is an SSRI. One of its side effects is tremors, but usually they're mild and resolve with time. She's been on it for 3 weeks, so maybe. But she started taking it after a stressful event, and her tremor worsened. Also, her tremor was already present, so could the SSRI be making it worse?

Option C: Adverse effect of atorvastatin. I don't recall statins causing tremors as a common side effect. Maybe muscle aches, but tremors? Not sure. So probably less likely.

Option D: Adverse effect of ibuprofen. Ibuprofen is a NSAID. Side effects include gastrointestinal issues, but I don't think tremors are a common side effect. So probably not.

Option E: Increase in alcohol consumption. She's drinking more wine, which she says helps her tremor. Wait, alcohol can sometimes cause tremors, especially if she's becoming dependent or if she's an alcoholic. But she's only drinking one glass a day, which is moderate. However, in some cases, alcohol can worsen tremors. Alternatively, she might be using alcohol as a coping mechanism, but if it's helping, why would the tremor get worse? Maybe she's been using it more, but the tremor is worse despite that. Hmm.

Option F: Hyperthyroidism. Hyperthyroidism can cause tremors, usually fine tremors. But her thyroid tests are pending. Her BMR is normal, though. She's 70, so less likely, but possible.

Option G: Bereavement reaction. Bereavement can cause anxiety and stress, which can exacerbate tremors. She started fluoxetine after her husband's death, which could be for depression or anxiety. Her tremor started worsening around the same time, so stress from bereavement could be a factor.

Option H: Adverse effect of lisinopril. Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor. Side effects include dizziness, low blood pressure, but not typically tremors. So probably not.

Option I: Essential tremor exacerbated by stress. Essential tremor is a common condition that often runs in families. It's typically worse with stress, fatigue, or certain medications. The tremor is usually kinetic or postural, not at rest. Her tremor is described as moderate, both hands, not at rest. So this fits essential tremor. The fact that it's been present most of her life, initially mild, and now worse with stress (bereavement) makes this a strong possibility.

Option J: Onset of multiple sclerosis. MS can cause tremors, but usually other symptoms would be present. She doesn't have a history of other issues, and the exam doesn't mention other signs like nystagmus or other neurological deficits. So less likely.

So considering all options, the most likely is I: Essential tremor exacerbated by stress.

Wait, but what about option B? Fluoxetine causing the tremor. Could the SSRI be making her tremor worse? Fluoxetine can cause tremors as a side effect, and she started it 3 weeks ago. But her tremor was already present before. Now, she's taking it for the bereavement. So is the tremor due to the SSRI or the stress?

Alternatively, maybe the stress from bereavement is causing the essential tremor to worsen. She's using alcohol to help it, which might be masking it or not. She's taking more wine, which might be interacting with her medications or affecting her tremor.

Another point: She says the tremor is worse when she's tired or stressed, which aligns with essential tremor. Also, her tremor isn't at rest, which is more like essential tremor than Parkinson's.

So putting it all together, her tremor is likely essential tremor that's getting worse due to stress from her husband's death, and possibly the fluoxetine could be contributing. But the primary issue is the essential tremor being exacerbated by stress.

So the answer should be I: Essential tremor exacerbated by stress.
</think>

The patient presents with a worsening tremor that has been present most of her life, initially mild and triggered by stress or fatigue. Over the past month, it has become more noticeable and frequent, causing embarrassment. She is taking fluoxetine for bereavement, uses alcohol to manage tremors, and has a history of essential hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The tremor is not present at rest, which is inconsistent with Parkinson disease. Fluoxetine can cause tremors, but the tremor predated its use. Atorvastatin and lisinopril are unlikely to cause tremors. Ibuprofen and increased alcohol use are less likely causes. Bereavement stress and stress in general can exacerbate essential tremor, which is characterized by action tremors and often has a genetic predisposition. The patient's history and presentation align with essential tremor exacerbated by stress rather than other options. 

Answer: I
