Okay, so I've got this question about finding the mass of oxygen in a cylinder. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on gas laws, but I'll give it a go.

The problem states: A cylinder contains oxygen at 10 atm pressure, 300 K temperature, and the volume is 10 liters. I need to find the mass of the oxygen. The options are from A to J, with various grams.

I remember the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. Yeah, that's right—pressure times volume equals moles times gas constant times temperature. So I can use this to find the number of moles, and then convert that into mass using the molar mass of oxygen.

First, let's note down the given values. Pressure P is 10 atm. Volume V is 10 liters. Temperature T is 300 K. The gas is oxygen, O2. Oh wait, the gas constant R has different values depending on the units. Since pressure is in atm and volume in liters, I think R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). That's right, I've seen that before.

So plugging into PV = nRT:

n = PV / (RT)

Let me compute each part. P is 10 atm, V is 10 L. So PV is 10 * 10 = 100 L·atm.

R is 0.0821, T is 300 K. So RT is 0.0821 * 300. Let's calculate that: 0.0821 * 300. Hmm, 0.0821 * 300 = 24.63. So RT is 24.63.

So n = 100 / 24.63. Let me compute that. 100 divided by 24.63 is approximately 4.059 moles. Wait, let me double-check: 24.63 * 4 is 98.52, and 24.63 * 4.05 is about 4.05 * 24.63. Let me do 4 *24.63=98.52, 0.05*24.63=1.2315, so total 99.7515. Hmm, but 24.63 *4.059 would be closer to 100. So n is approximately 4.059 moles.

Now, oxygen is O2, so its molar mass is the atomic mass of O multiplied by 2. The atomic mass of O is about 16 g/mol, so O2 is 32 g/mol.

So mass m = n * molar mass = 4.059 * 32.

Calculating that: 4 *32=128, 0.059*32=1.888. So total is approximately 128 + 1.888 = 129.888 grams. Wait, that's roughly 130 grams. Looking at the options, option G is 130.08 grams. That must be the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me recheck the numbers.

PV = 10 atm * 10 L = 100 L·atm.

RT = 0.0821 * 300 = 24.63 L·atm/mol.

n = 100 / 24.63 ≈ 4.059 mol.

Molar mass O2 is 32 g/mol.

4.059 *32 = let's calculate more accurately.

4 *32=128.

0.059 *32 = 1.888.

Total 128 +1.888=129.888 grams. So that's approximately 129.89 grams, which rounds to about 130 grams. So option G is 130.08 grams, which is very close. Hmm, perhaps I should check if I used the correct value for R. Sometimes R is taken as 0.08206, but that's negligible. Alternatively, maybe I should carry more decimal places in the calculations.

Wait, maybe I should compute 100 divided by 24.63 more precisely. Let me do that division accurately. 24.63 *4 is 98.52, which leaves 1.48. So 1.48 /24.63 ≈0.0599. So n is approximately 4.0599 moles.

Then 4.0599 *32 = 4.0599 *30=121.797 and 4.0599 *2=8.1198. So 121.797 +8.1198=129.9168 grams. So that's about 129.92 grams, which is approximately 130 grams. So yes, option G is 130.08 grams, which is the closest. 

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think if I used the right units. The volume is 10 liters, which is correct. Pressure in atm, yes. Temperature in Kelvin, yes. So the units are correct for R=0.0821. So I think my calculation is correct, so the answer should be G:130.08 grams.

To determine the mass of oxygen in the cylinder, we use the ideal gas law \( PV = nRT \), where \( P \) is pressure, \( V \) is volume, \( n \) is the number of moles, \( R \) is the gas constant, and \( T \) is temperature. 

Given:
- \( P = 10 \, \text{atm} \)
- \( V = 10 \, \text{L} \)
- \( T = 300 \, \text{K} \)
- \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \)

First, calculate \( n \) (moles of oxygen):
\[
n = \frac{PV}{RT} = \frac{10 \times 10}{0.0821 \times 300} = \frac{100}{24.63} \approx 4.059 \, \text{mol}
\]

Next, calculate the mass of oxygen. The molar mass of \( \text{O}_2 \) is \( 32 \, \text{g/mol} \):
\[
\text{Mass} = n \times \text{Molar Mass} = 4.059 \times 32 \approx 129.89 \, \text{g}
\]

The closest option to this value is **130.08 grams**, which corresponds to option **G**.
