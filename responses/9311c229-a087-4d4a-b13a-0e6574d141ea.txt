Okay, so I have this economics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about short-run costs and which one always increases as output increases. Let me go through each option one by one.

First, the options are A to I, and I need to pick the correct one. Let's start by recalling some basic concepts. In the short run, costs are divided into fixed and variable. Fixed costs don't change with output, like rent or salaries, while variable costs change with the level of production, like raw materials.

The question is asking which cost increases as output increases. So I'm looking for a cost that definitely goes up when more goods are produced.

Option A: Average variable cost. Average variable cost (AVC) is total variable cost divided by output. As output increases, AVC might decrease if the marginal cost is increasing, but I'm not sure. Wait, actually, in the short run, AVC typically decreases initially as output increases due to economies of scale, but then might increase after a certain point due to diminishing returns. So it's not always increasing.

Option B: Marginal revenue. Hmm, marginal revenue is the additional revenue from selling one more unit. But the question is about cost, not revenue. So B is probably not the right answer.

Option C: Average total cost. Average total cost (ATC) is total cost divided by output. Total cost is fixed plus variable. As output increases, fixed costs are spread over more units, so ATC might decrease at first but could increase later if AVC increases. So ATC isn't always increasing.

Option D: Marginal cost. Marginal cost is the cost of producing one more unit. In the short run, initially, MC decreases because of spreading fixed costs, but after a certain point, it starts increasing due to diminishing marginal returns. So MC isn't always increasing; it first decreases and then increases.

Option E: Total variable cost (TVC). TVC definitely increases as output increases because you're producing more, so you need more materials, labor, etc. So E seems like a strong candidate.

Option F: Total overhead cost. Overhead is a fixed cost, so it doesn't change with output. So F is out.

Option G: Average revenue cost. I'm not sure what this is. Maybe it's a typo? Perhaps they meant average variable cost or something else. But since I don't recognize this term, I'll skip it for now.

Option H: Total fixed cost. Fixed costs don't change with output, so H is out.

Option I: Average fixed cost. Averaging fixed costs over more output means this decreases as output increases. So I is not the answer.

So, going back, the only one that definitely increases with output is E: Total variable cost. Because as you make more, your variable costs like labor and materials go up.

The correct answer is E: Total variable cost, as it consistently increases with higher output.

Answer: E
