Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the z-parameters given the y-parameters. Hmm, I remember that y-parameters and z-parameters are related through some formulas, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me try to recall.

The y-parameters (or admittance parameters) are given as y11, y12, and y22. The values are y11 = 0.25 mho, y12 = -0.05 mho, and y22 = 0.1 mho. I need to convert these into z-parameters (or impedance parameters). 

I think the conversion formulas involve reciprocals and combinations of these y-parameters. From what I remember, the z-parameters can be found using the following formulas when the network is two-port. Let me jot them down:

z11 = 1/y11
z12 = z21 = y22/(y11*y22 - y12^2)
z22 = 1/y22

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm mixing up the formulas. Alternatively, I recall that the z-parameters can be found using the inverse of the y-parameters matrix. Oh right, because the relationship between Y and Z is that they are inverse matrices if the network is linear and reciprocal.

The Y matrix is [[y11, y12], [y21, y22]]. Since the network is reciprocal, y21 equals y12, so the Y matrix is [[0.25, -0.05], [-0.05, 0.1]]. 

The Z matrix is the inverse of the Y matrix. So to find Z, I need to invert the Y matrix. The inverse of a 2x2 matrix [[a, b], [c, d]] is (1/(ad - bc)) * [[d, -b], [-c, a]]. 

Let me compute the determinant first. The determinant D is (y11*y22 - y12^2) = (0.25 * 0.1) - (-0.05)^2 = 0.025 - 0.0025 = 0.0225. So D is 0.0225.

Now, the inverse Y matrix (which is Z) will be (1/D) multiplied by [[y22, -y12], [-y12, y11]]. 

So plugging in the numbers:

z11 = (y22)/D = 0.1 / 0.0225 = approximately 4.444... Ohms.
z12 = (-y12)/D = -(-0.05)/0.0225 = 0.05/0.0225 ≈ 2.222... Ohms.
z21 = same as z12 because the network is reciprocal, so also 2.222 Ohms.
z22 = y11/D = 0.25 / 0.0225 ≈ 11.111... Ohms.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see that some options have the z11 as 4.44, z12 and z21 as 2.22, and z22 as 11.1. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option E says z11=4.44, z12=z21=2.22, z22=22.2. Hmm, that doesn't match because z22 from my calculation is about 11.1, not 22.2. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, no, let's double-check the calculations. D is 0.0225. So:

z11 = y22 / D = 0.1 / 0.0225 = (0.1 * 10000) / 225 = 1000 / 225 ≈ 4.444.

z22 = y11 / D = 0.25 / 0.0225 = (0.25 * 10000)/225 = 2500/225 ≈ 11.111.

z12 = (-y12) / D = 0.05 / 0.0225 ≈ 2.222.

Wait, so the z22 should be approximately 11.1, not 22.2. Let me look again at the options.

Option F: z11=4.44, z12=2.22, z21=2.22, z22=11.1. That matches my calculations. But wait, looking at the options, I see that option E is z22=22.2, which is twice my value. Did I miss a factor somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating D. Let me recalculate D: y11*y22 is 0.25 * 0.1 = 0.025. y12 squared is (-0.05)^2 = 0.0025. So D = 0.025 - 0.0025 = 0.0225. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the formula. Another way to look at it is that Z11 is 1/y11 when the other port is open, but that's only when the network is a two-terminal device. Alternatively, maybe I should use the general formula for converting Y to Z.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formulas:

z11 = (y22 - y12^2/y11)⁻¹? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing Y and Z parameters.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The standard formulas for converting Y to Z for a two-port network are:

z11 = (y22 - y12^2/y11)⁻¹, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the matrix inversion method which I did earlier.

Wait, I think my initial approach was correct. So according to that, z11 is about 4.44, z22 is about 11.1, and z12 and z21 are about 2.22 each.

Looking at the options, option F is:

F: z11 = 4.44 Ω, z12 = z21 = 2.22 Ω, z22 = 11.1 Ω.

So that's the one that matches. But wait, let me check all the options again.

Looking at the options provided:

Option E: z11=4.44, z12=2.22, z21=2.22, z22=22.2. So z22 here is 22.2, which is double my calculation.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check the inversion formula.

The inverse matrix Z is (1/D) * [[y22, -y12], [-y12, y11]]. So:

z11 = (y22)/D = 0.1 / 0.0225 ≈ 4.444.

z12 = (-y12)/D = 0.05 / 0.0225 ≈ 2.222.

z22 = y11/D = 0.25 / 0.0225 ≈ 11.111.

So the correct z22 is approximately 11.1, which matches option F.

But wait, looking back at the options, option F is not listed as correct. Wait, no, let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option F: z11=4.44, z12=z21=2.22, z22=11.1. That's exactly what I calculated.

So the correct answer should be option F. But looking at the options, is option F present?

Yes, option F is present. So the answer is F.

The z-parameters are calculated using the inverse of the Y matrix. Given the y-parameters, the determinant is computed as 0.0225. Applying the inversion formulas, the z-parameters are found to be approximately z11 = 4.44 Ω, z12 = z21 = 2.22 Ω, and z22 = 11.1 Ω, matching option F.
