Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"Since the foundations of the American commonwealth were laid in colonial times over 300 years ago, vigorous complaint and more or less bitter persecution have been aimed at newcomers to our shores. Also the congressional reports of about 1840 are full of abuse of English, Scotch, Welsh immigrants as paupers, criminals, and so forth. Old citizens in Detroit of Irish and German descent have told me of the fierce tirades and propaganda directed against the great waves of Irish and Germans who came over from 1840 on for a few decades to escape civil, racial, and religious persecution in their native lands. The "Know-Nothings," lineal ancestors of the Ku-Klux Klan, bitterly denounced the Irish and Germans as mongrels, scum, foreigners, and a menace to our institutions, much as other great branches of the Caucasian race of glorious history and antecedents are berated to-day….But to-day it is the Italians, Spanish, Poles, Jews, Greeks, Russians, Balkanians, and so forth, who are the racial lepers…..In this bill we find racial discrimination at its worst—a deliberate attempt to go back 84 years in our census taken every 10 years so that a blow may be aimed at peoples of eastern and southern Europe, particularly at our recent allies in the Great War—Poland and Italy."
Robert H. Clancy, Congressional Record, 68th Congress, 1st Session, 1924

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about US history, specifically about nativism and legislative acts. I need to figure out which act is an example of nativism based on the provided excerpt. Let me start by understanding the question and the context.

First, the excerpt from Robert H. Clancy discusses how throughout American history, there's been a pattern of discrimination against various immigrant groups. He mentions how different groups like Irish, Germans, and later Italians, Poles, etc., were targeted with harsh language and policies. The key part here is about a bill that uses racial discrimination, going back in the census to target Eastern and Southern Europeans, especially recent allies like Poland and Italy. So the issue here is about exclusionary immigration policies, likely aimed at restricting certain groups from entering the country.

Now, the question is asking which legislative act is most closely an example of nativism. Nativism, as I recall, is the policy or practice of favoring the interests of native-born inhabitants over those of immigrants. It often involves restrictive laws on immigration, citizenship, or employment.

Looking at the options, I need to identify which act fits this definition. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. I think this act ended the quota system and allowed immigration based on skills and family reunification. It's more about opening up immigration rather than restricting it, so it's probably not nativist.

Option B: The War Powers Act of 1973. This is about how the President can deploy troops without Congress's immediate consent during emergencies. Doesn't seem related to immigration or nativism.

Option C: The Homestead Act of 1862. This was about providing free land to settlers to encourage westward expansion. It's more about settlement and land ownership, not immigration, so probably not.

Option D: The Social Security Act of 1935. This established the Social Security system, providing benefits for the elderly and unemployed. Not related to immigration or nativism.

Option E: The Naturalization Act of 1790. This was one of the early naturalization laws, setting requirements for citizenship, like being a white person of good character. It's exclusionary in that it only allowed white immigrants to become citizens, which does show some nativist tendencies by favoring certain groups. But I'm not sure if it's the best example here compared to others.

Option F: The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. This is a clear example of nativism. It banned Chinese immigrants from coming to the US and prevented those already here from becoming citizens. This was a direct response to anti-Chinese sentiment, so this act is definitely about restricting a specific ethnic group, fitting the definition of nativism.

Option G: The Espionage Act of 1917. This was passed during World War I to penalize actions like spreading false information about the government or military. It's more about internal security and not directly about immigration.

Option H: The Wagner Act of 1935. This is the National Labor Relations Act, which protects workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively. Not related to immigration or nativism.

Option I: The Civil Rights Act of 1964. This addresses discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in employment and public accommodations. While it deals with discrimination, it's more about civil rights rather than nativist immigration policies.

Option J: The Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798. These were laws intended to suppress anti-Federalist dissent, allowing the government to deport aliens considered dangerous and restricting freedom of speech. While they target aliens, their main purpose was political control, not necessarily about restricting immigration based on nationality or ethnicity in the same way as the Chinese Exclusion Act.

So, looking back at the question, the excerpt talks about a bill targeting Eastern and Southern Europeans, which aligns with the Chinese Exclusion Act's focus on excluding a specific ethnic group. The 1924 bill mentioned in the excerpt is similar to the Chinese Exclusion Act in intent, though it's targeting different groups.

Wait, but the Chinese Exclusion Act specifically targets Chinese immigrants, while the 1924 bill targets Eastern and Southern Europeans. However, the question is about which act is an example of nativism, and the Chinese Exclusion Act is a classic example.

Alternatively, the 1924 act that Clancy refers to is the Immigration Act of 1924, which indeed established a quota system favoring Northern and Western Europeans over Southern and Eastern Europeans. But that act isn't listed in the options.

Looking at the options again, the closest is F: Chinese Exclusion Act, which is a clear example of nativism. The other options don't fit as well. The Naturalization Act of 1790 (E) is exclusionary but more about citizenship than immigration. The Alien and Sedition Acts (J) are more about political control.

Therefore, the best answer is F: The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.

The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 is the most closely related to the nativist sentiment described in the excerpt, as it explicitly targeted a specific ethnic group for exclusion. 

Answer: F
