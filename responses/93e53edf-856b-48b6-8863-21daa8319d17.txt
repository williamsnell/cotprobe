Okay, so I've got this math problem here: Compute 22 divided by 2 plus 9. Hmm, let me think about how to solve this. I remember from school that when you have a combination of division and addition, you should do the division first before the addition because of the order of operations, right? So, PEMDAS—Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction.

Wait, so in this case, there are no parentheses or exponents, so I should do the division first. Let me break it down. 22 divided by 2, that's straightforward. 22 divided by 2 equals 11. Okay, so now I have 11 plus 9. Adding those together, 11 plus 9 is 20. So the result should be 20.

Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 22 ÷ 2 is 11, then 11 + 9 is 20. Yep, that makes sense. I don't think I did anything wrong there. So looking at the options, I need to find which one is 20. Let me see the options again: A is 24, B is 23, C is 21, D is 22, E is 10, F is 25, G is 2, H is 20, I is 19, J is 11. So H is 20, which must be the correct answer.

Wait, just to be thorough, what if someone did the addition first? Let's see. If someone did 22 divided by (2 + 9), that would be 22 divided by 11, which is 2. But that's not the case here because the original problem is 22/2 +9, without any parentheses. So the order of operations definitely require division before addition. So yeah, 20 is the right answer. I'm confident now that H is the correct choice.

The problem requires computing 22 divided by 2 plus 9. Following the order of operations (PEMDAS), division is performed before addition. 

22 ÷ 2 = 11  
11 + 9 = 20  

Thus, the correct answer is H.
