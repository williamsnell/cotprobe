Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about two statements, and I need to figure out if each is true or not. Let me take it step by step.

First, the question presents two statements. I need to evaluate each one and then choose the correct option from A to J based on their truth values.

**Statement 1:** Suppose f : [a, b] is a function and suppose f has a local maximum. f'(x) must exist and equal 0?

Hmm, I remember from calculus that if a function has a local maximum at a point inside its domain, and if the function is differentiable at that point, then the derivative should be zero. But wait, does the function have to be differentiable there? What if it's not differentiable? Like, for example, the absolute value function has a point at zero which is a local minimum, but the derivative doesn't exist there because of the sharp corner. So in that case, the function isn't differentiable, but it still has a local extremum.

So applying that to Statement 1: If f has a local maximum at some point c in [a, b], does f'(c) have to exist and be zero? Well, if f is differentiable at c, then yes, the derivative is zero. But if f isn't differentiable at c, then the derivative doesn't exist. So the statement is saying that f'(x) must exist and equal zero. But that's not necessarily true because f might not be differentiable there. So Statement 1 is false.

Wait, but wait. The function f is defined on [a, b]. Is that all? Oh, I think in the question, it's given as f : [a, b], but that's incomplete. It should probably say f: [a, b] → ℝ, but regardless, the key point is about differentiability. So Statement 1 is false because f might not be differentiable at the local maximum point.

**Statement 2:** There exist non-constant continuous maps from ℝ to ℚ.

Okay, so a continuous map from the real numbers to the rationals. Hmm. I know that ℝ is a connected space, and ℚ is totally disconnected. Continuous images of connected spaces are connected. But ℚ is totally disconnected, meaning its only connected subsets are single points. So if a function is continuous from ℝ (which is connected) to ℚ, the image must be a single point, right? Because any continuous function from ℝ would have an image that's connected, and the only connected subsets of ℚ are singleton sets.

Wait, but the statement says "non-constant" continuous maps. If the image has to be a single point, that would make the function constant. So there can't be any non-constant continuous maps from ℝ to ℚ. Because any continuous function would have to be constant, so non-constant ones don't exist. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. If I have a function f: ℝ → ℚ that's continuous, then f must be constant. Because if it's not constant, then the image would have at least two points, which would contradict the connectedness. So yes, any continuous map from ℝ to ℚ must be constant. Hence, there are no non-constant continuous maps from ℝ to ℚ. So Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but wait another thought. Are there any exceptions? Like, maybe some pathological functions? But no, because the connectedness argument is pretty solid. So Statement 2 is false.

Putting it together:

Statement 1 is false.

Statement 2 is false.

So looking at the options, the possible answers are options where Statement 1 is False and Statement 2 is False. Let's see the options:

A: Neither, False → No, because S1 is False.

B: Neither, True → No.

C: False, Neither → No, because S2 is False.

D: False, True or False → Hmm, not sure what that means. Probably not.

E: True, Neither → No.

F: False, False → Yes, this matches.

G: Neither, Neither → No.

H: False, True → No.

I: True, True → No.

J: True, False → No.

Wait, but looking back, the options are labeled as:

Each option is in the format: [Statement1, Statement2]

Looking back, option F is "False, False".

So the correct answer should be F: False, False.
</think>

The first statement is false because a function with a local maximum does not necessarily have a derivative at that point. The second statement is false because continuous maps from ℝ to ℚ must be constant, so non-constant ones cannot exist.
