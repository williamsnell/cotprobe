Okay, so I have this tax question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is asking which of the given options cannot be amortized for tax purposes. Let me start by recalling what amortization means. Amortization is an accounting method used to spread the cost of an intangible asset over its useful life. It's like depreciation but for non-physical assets. So, if an expense is amortizable, it can be deducted over time rather than all at once, which can be beneficial for tax purposes.

Looking at the options, I need to figure out which one isn't an amortizable expense. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Legal fees associated with incorporation. Incorporation is the process of forming a corporation, and legal fees are often part of that. I think these might be considered as start-up costs. I remember that some start-up costs can be amortized, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe they can be amortized over 15 years or something like that.

Option B: Organizational meeting costs. These are the costs associated with setting up the organizational meetings for the company. I think these are also considered part of the start-up costs. I'm pretty sure that these can be amortized, but I'm not certain about the exact rules.

Option C: Stock issuance costs. When a company issues stock, there are various costs involved, like underwriting fees, legal fees, and so on. I think these are generally considered part of the capital structure and might be amortized. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes these costs are expensed immediately. Or maybe they are amortized as part of the debt or equity. I'm not sure.

Option D: Costs associated with obtaining a patent. Patents are definitely intangible assets. The costs to obtain a patent, like legal fees and filing costs, are amortized over the life of the patent, which is usually 20 years. So this one for sure can be amortized.

Option E: Temporary directors’ fees. Hmm, this is interesting. Temporary directors might be part of the start-up phase. I think that some initial organizational costs, including directors' fees, can be amortized. But I'm not entirely certain if temporary directors' fees specifically are included in this. I might need to think more about this.

Option F: Costs associated with obtaining a business license. Business licenses are typically considered ordinary business expenses, right? Or are they amortized? I'm not sure. Maybe they are expensed in the year they're incurred, but I'm not certain if they can be amortized over a longer period.

Option G: Incorporation costs. This seems similar to option A. Incorporation costs, including legal fees and other expenses, are usually part of the start-up costs. I believe these can be amortized over 15 years, but I need to confirm.

Wait, let me try to remember the IRS rules. I think that under IRC Section 195, certain start-up costs can be amortized. These include legal fees, accounting fees, costs of organizational meetings, and even some initial salaries. But I'm not sure about stock issuance costs or business license fees.

Stock issuance costs (Option C) are typically considered part of the proceeds from the sale of the stock. So, under GAAP, they are deducted from the proceeds, but for tax purposes, I think they are treated as a reduction in the basis of the stock. But I'm not sure if they're amortized. Maybe they are considered capital expenses and not amortized. So perhaps Option C cannot be amortized.

Let me think about each option again:

A: Legal fees for incorporation are start-up costs, so can be amortized. So not the answer.

B: Organizational meeting costs are also start-up, so amortizable. Not the answer.

C: Stock issuance costs - I'm leaning towards these not being amortizable. They might be considered as part of the capital structure and not expensed or amortized. So maybe this is the correct answer.

D: Patent costs are amortizable. Not the answer.

E: Temporary directors' fees - these are part of start-up costs, so they can be amortized. Not the answer.

F: Business license costs. Hmm, I'm not sure. If it's a one-time fee, maybe it's expensed, but some might allow amortization. Alternatively, it could be considered a regulatory fee, not an intangible asset. So perhaps this is not amortizable, but I'm not certain.

G: Incorporation costs are amortizable as start-up costs. So not the answer.

Wait, so between F and C. Let me think again. Stock issuance costs are typically treated as a reduction in the proceeds and not as an expense. So they can't be amortized. Business license fees are usually expensed in the year they're incurred because they're considered a periodic fee, not an intangible asset with a useful life. So maybe both C and F cannot be amortized. But the question asks which cannot be amortized, so perhaps the answer is C.

Alternatively, business license fees might be considered an expense each year, but if the license is for multiple years, perhaps it can be amortized. For example, if a license is paid for three years upfront, then it could be amortized over three years. But if it's an annual fee, it's expensed each year. So if the question refers to a one-time cost, it could be amortized. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the question is about which cannot be amortized. So if I have to choose one, perhaps C is the correct answer because stock issuance costs are not considered amortizable. They are typically treated as a cost against the capital raised, not as an expense or amortized asset.

So putting it all together, the answer is C: Stock issuance costs.

The question asks which of the given options cannot be amortized for tax purposes. Amortization is the process of spreading the cost of an intangible asset over its useful life. To determine the correct answer, each option is analyzed:

- **Option A**: Legal fees for incorporation are considered start-up costs and can be amortized over 15 years.  
- **Option B**: Organizational meeting costs are also start-up costs and can be amortized.  
- **Option C**: Stock issuance costs are typically treated as a reduction in the proceeds from the sale of stock and are not amortized.  
- **Option D**: Costs to obtain a patent are amortizable over the patent's life (usually 20 years).  
- **Option E**: Temporary directors’ fees are part of start-up costs and can be amortized.  
- **Option F**: Business license costs may be expensed in the year incurred or amortized if paid for multiple years upfront, but this depends on the specific circumstances.  
- **Option G**: Incorporation costs are start-up costs and can be amortized.  

Based on this analysis, **Option C: Stock issuance costs** is the correct answer, as they are not considered amortizable for tax purposes.
