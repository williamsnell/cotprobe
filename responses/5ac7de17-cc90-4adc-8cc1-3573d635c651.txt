Okay, so I have this physics problem here about magnetic flux through a coil. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. Alright, the question is: A circular coil with a diameter of 20 mm is placed perpendicular to a uniform magnetic flux density of 100 mT. I need to find the total flux threading the coil. The options are from A to J.

Wait, I remember that magnetic flux is calculated using the formula Φ = B * A * cosθ, where Φ is the flux, B is the magnetic field strength, A is the area, and θ is the angle between the magnetic field and the normal to the surface. Since the coil's plane is perpendicular to the magnetic field, that means the angle θ is 0 degrees because the magnetic field is perpendicular to the coil's surface. So cosθ would be cos(0) which is 1. That simplifies the equation to Φ = B * A.

Now, I need to find the area A of the coil. The coil is circular with a diameter of 20 mm. Oh wait, I should convert that to meters because the magnetic field is given in millitesla. 20 mm is 0.02 meters. The radius would be half of that, so 0.01 meters. The area of a circle is πr², so plugging in the radius, A = π * (0.01)^2 = π * 0.0001 m². Let me calculate that. Pi is approximately 3.1416, so 3.1416 * 0.0001 is about 0.00031416 m².

Next, the magnetic flux density B is 100 mT. Wait, milli is 10^-3, so 100 mT is 0.1 T. Oh right, because 1 T equals 1000 mT. So B is 0.1 T.

Now, putting it all into the flux formula: Φ = 0.1 T * 0.00031416 m². Let me multiply those. 0.1 * 0.00031416 equals 0.000031416 Weber. Wait, but the options are in micro Weber (µWb), right? Because 1 Weber is 10^6 µWb. So 0.000031416 Wb is 31.416 µWb. Hmm, looking at the options, option E is 31.4 µWb. That seems close enough, considering I rounded pi to 3.1416.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. The diameter is 20 mm, so radius 10 mm or 0.01 m. Area is π*(0.01)^2 = π*0.0001=0.00031416 m². B is 100 mT which is 0.1 T. So 0.1 * 0.00031416 is indeed 0.000031416 Wb. Converting to µWb, multiply by 1e6, so 31.416 µWb, which rounds to 31.4, so E is correct.

Alternatively, wait another thought: Did I get the units right? The area calculation: 20 mm diameter, radius 10 mm. So area is π*(0.01 m)^2. Yes, because 10 mm is 0.01 m. So yes, that's correct. And B is 100 mT=0.1 T. So all steps seem correct. So I think the answer is E: 31.4 µWb.

The magnetic flux Φ is calculated using Φ = B * A, where B is the magnetic field (0.1 T) and A is the area of the coil. The diameter of the circular coil is 20 mm, giving a radius of 0.01 m. The area A = π * (0.01)^2 = 0.00031416 m². Substituting into the flux formula, Φ = 0.1 * 0.00031416 = 0.000031416 Wb, which is 31.416 µWb. Rounding to one decimal place, the flux is 31.4 µWb, corresponding to option E.

Answer: E
