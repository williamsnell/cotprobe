Okay, so I have this question about Federal Reserve actions and how they affect the money supply. I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which list contains only Fed actions that will increase the money supply. There are several options, each with three actions. I need to figure out which actions increase the money supply.

First, I remember that the Fed has three main tools: reserve requirements, discount rate, and open market operations (buying or selling bonds). Let's go through each tool and what they do.

1. **Reserve Requirements**: When the Fed lowers reserve requirements, banks are required to hold less money in reserves. This means they can lend out more, which increases the money supply. If they raise reserve requirements, the opposite happens—banks have to hold more, so they lend less, decreasing the money supply.

2. **Discount Rate**: This is the interest rate the Fed charges banks for loans. If the Fed lowers the discount rate, it becomes cheaper for banks to borrow money. They are more likely to borrow, which allows them to lend more to customers, increasing the money supply. Raising the discount rate makes borrowing more expensive, so banks borrow less, reducing lending and the money supply.

3. **Open Market Operations (Buying/Selling Bonds)**: When the Fed buys bonds, it injects money into the banking system. Banks have more funds to lend, increasing the money supply. Selling bonds does the opposite—it takes money out of the system, decreasing the money supply.

Now, let's analyze each option to see if all three actions in the option increase the money supply.

**Option A: Lower reserve requirements; lower discount rate; buy bonds.**
- Lower reserve req: increases money supply.
- Lower discount rate: increases.
- Buy bonds: increases.
All three actions increase, so this option is a candidate.

**Option B: Lower reserve req; lower discount rate; sell bonds.**
- Lower reserve req and discount rate: good. But selling bonds decreases money supply. So this option isn't correct.

**Option C: Raise reserve req; lower discount rate; buy bonds.**
- Raise reserve req: decreases money supply.
- Lower discount rate: increases.
- Buy bonds: increases.
But since one action decreases, this option is out.

**Option D: Raise reserve req; raise discount rate; sell bonds.**
All three actions decrease the money supply. So no.

**Option E: Lower reserve req; raise discount rate; buy bonds.**
- Lower reserve req: good.
- Raise discount rate: bad.
- Buy bonds: good.
Since one action is bad, this option is incorrect.

**Option F: Lower reserve req; raise discount rate; sell bonds.**
- Lower reserve req: good.
- Raise discount rate: bad.
- Sell bonds: bad.
Two actions are bad, so no.

**Option G: Raise reserve req; raise discount rate; buy bonds.**
- Raise reserve req and discount rate: bad.
- Buy bonds: good.
Two bad actions, so no.

**Option H: Raise reserve req; lower discount rate; sell bonds.**
- Raise reserve req: bad.
- Lower discount rate: good.
- Sell bonds: bad.
Two bad actions, so no.

So the only option where all three actions increase the money supply is Option A.

The correct answer is Option A, as all actions listed (lowering reserve requirements, lowering the discount rate, and buying bonds) contribute to increasing the money supply.

Answer: A
