Okay, so I need to solve this heat calculation problem. Let me read it again carefully. The question has two parts, (a) and (b). 

Part (a) is about converting a liter of water at 30°C to a liter at 60°C. Part (b) is heating a 1 kg block of aluminum from 30°C to 60°C. The specific heats are given: water is 1 cal/g°C, and aluminum is 0.215 cal/g°C.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says "convert a liter of H2O" to a liter at a higher temperature. But wait, the volume is the same, so maybe it's just heating, not changing phase. Because if you heat water beyond its boiling point, it would vaporize, but the question specifies the volume remains a liter, so I think it's just heating without phase change.

So, for both parts, I'll use the formula Q = m * c * ΔT.

Starting with part (a): the water.

First, I need to find the mass of a liter of water. I remember that 1 liter of water weighs approximately 1000 grams because the density of water is about 1 g/cm³. So, 1 liter = 1000 grams.

The specific heat capacity (c) for water is 1 cal/g°C. The temperature change (ΔT) is 60°C - 30°C = 30°C.

So, Q for water = m * c * ΔT = 1000 g * 1 cal/g°C * 30°C = 30,000 calories. But the options are in kilocalories (kcal), so I need to convert. 1 kcal is 1000 cal, so 30,000 cal is 30 kcal.

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second. Wait, no, that's correct. 30,000 cal is 30 kcal. So part (a) is 30 kcal.

Now, part (b): heating 1 kg of aluminum from 30°C to 60°C. 

Wait, 1 kg is 1000 grams. The specific heat of aluminum is 0.215 cal/g°C. The temperature change is 30°C.

So Q for aluminum = m * c * ΔT = 1000 g * 0.215 cal/g°C * 30°C.

Let me calculate that: 1000 * 0.215 = 215, then 215 * 30 = 6450 calories. Convert to kcal: 6450 / 1000 = 6.45 kcal.

So part (b) is 6.45 kcal.

Now, looking at the options, I need to find which option has part (a) as 30 kcal and part (b) as approximately 6.45 kcal.

Looking at the options:

A: 28, 6.3 → No

B:40,5 → No

C:30, 8.58 → Part (a) is right, but part (b) is higher. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Did I compute part (b) correctly? Let me check again.

m = 1 kg = 1000 g.

c = 0.215 cal/g°C.

ΔT = 30°C.

So 1000 * 0.215 = 215 cal/°C. Multiply by 30: 215 *30 = 6450 cal. 6450 cal is 6.45 kcal.

So part (b) is 6.45 kcal. So looking at the options:

Option G is 30 kcal, 6.45 kcal. So that would be correct.

Wait, but looking at the options again, is that correct?

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option G: 30 kcal, 6.45 kcal → Yes.

So the correct answer would be option G.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, specific heat can be in different units. Like, sometimes it's given in cal/(kg·°C). Let me check the problem statement again.

Problem says the specific heat of water is 1 cal/g°C and aluminum is 0.215 cal/g°C. So it's per gram. So my calculation is correct, using grams.

Alternatively, if someone used kg, they might make a mistake. But I used grams, so m=1000g, correct.

So yes, the answer should be G: 30 kcal and 6.45 kcal.

The heat required for part (a) is calculated using the formula \( Q = m \cdot c \cdot \Delta T \), where \( m = 1000 \, \text{g} \), \( c = 1 \, \text{cal/g°C} \), and \( \Delta T = 30 \, \text{°C} \). This gives \( Q = 30,000 \, \text{cal} = 30 \, \text{kcal} \). For part (b), \( m = 1000 \, \text{g} \), \( c = 0.215 \, \text{cal/g°C} \), and \( \Delta T = 30 \, \text{°C} \), resulting in \( Q = 6,450 \, \text{cal} = 6.45 \, \text{kcal} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is G.
