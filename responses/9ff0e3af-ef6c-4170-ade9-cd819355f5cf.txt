Okay, so I've got this question about sociologists attributing the 'epidemic' of anorexia in Western cultures to certain factors. The question is asking which option correctly identifies the cause according to Bordo (1993). Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to recall what Bordo's work says about anorexia. From what I remember, Bordo is a sociologist who examines how eating disorders are influenced by cultural factors. She argues that anorexia isn't just a medical issue but is also socially constructed. 

The options are A through G. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: the rise in stress and anxiety levels in modern society. While stress and anxiety are often cited as contributing factors, Bordo's focus was more on cultural ideals rather than individual stress levels. So maybe not A.

Option B: a generally ascetic, frugal lifestyle that can be taken to extremes. Asceticism refers to severe self-discipline, often in the context of religious practices. I'm not sure if Bordo linked anorexia to a general frugal lifestyle. It seems more about societal beauty standards rather than asceticism.

Option C: the increase in fast food consumption and obesity. This seems more related to the opposite end of the spectrumâ€”obesity and its causes. Bordo's work is about the pursuit of thinness, not necessarily about fast food or obesity itself causing anorexia.

Option D: the lack of awareness about healthy diet and exercise. While education about diet and exercise is important, Bordo's analysis likely points to a cultural ideal of thinness rather than a lack of awareness as the main cause.

Option E: the social construction of mental illness, through which 'normal' patterns of behaviour are pathologized. This is interesting. Bordo does discuss how certain behaviors are medicalized. She might argue that anorexia is a way society defines and pathologizes certain behaviors, especially in women. So E could be a contender.

Option F: traditional images of women as emotional, domesticated, and unassertive. While traditional gender roles do play a role in many societal issues, I'm not sure if Bordo specifically ties anorexia to these traditional images. It seems more about modern ideals of femininity.

Option G: the new ideal of independent, self-assured femininity, combined with cultural values of achievement and control. This sounds more in line with Bordo's arguments. She talks about how the pursuit of thinness reflects broader societal values, including the ideal of women being self-controlled and achieving perfection in their bodies, which ties into the culture of control and independence.

Wait, but I thought E was about social construction of mental illness. Let me think. Bordo does critique the medicalization of anorexia, arguing that it's a way to pathologize certain behaviors that are seen as abnormal. So, E might also be correct, but I'm not sure if it's the primary factor she attributes the epidemic to.

Comparing E and G: The question is about the 'epidemic' being attributed to a cause. Bordo's work, as I recall, emphasizes the cultural ideal of thinness and the way it's constructed, especially in relation to women's roles and the pursuit of control and independence. So G seems to capture that aspect, linking it to the new ideal of femininity combined with achievement and control.

Alternatively, E is about how normal behaviors are pathologized. That's a point Bordo makes, but perhaps not the main cause of the epidemic. The main cause is more about the cultural push towards a certain body image, which is tied to G.

So, I'm leaning towards G as the correct answer.

The correct answer is **G**. Sociologists like Bordo (1993) attribute the 'epidemic' of anorexia in Western cultures to the new ideal of independent, self-assured femininity, combined with cultural values of achievement and control. This reflects the broader societal emphasis on thinness and self-control, particularly as it pertains to women's roles and identities.

Answer: G
