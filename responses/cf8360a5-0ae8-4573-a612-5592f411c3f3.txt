Okay, so I have this question about the acf and pacf in time series analysis. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, I need to understand what each statement is saying and then evaluate their truthfulness.

The question lists four statements (i) to (iv), and I have to choose which combination is correct from the options A to J.

Let me go through each statement one by one.

(i) The acf and pacf are often hard to interpret in practice.
Hmm, I remember that acf stands for Autocorrelation Function and pacf is Partial Autocorrelation Function. From what I've learned, interpreting these can be tricky, especially for someone new. They require understanding of the patterns, like whether they're cutting off after a certain lag or tapering off, which might suggest AR or MA models. So, I think (i) is true because they can be hard to interpret, especially without much experience.

(ii) The acf and pacf can be difficult to calculate for some data sets.
Wait, calculating acf and pacf... I think these are pretty standard functions that most statistical software can compute without issues. They're just mathematical computations based on the data. Unless the dataset is extremely large, which might slow down computation, but generally, they shouldn't be too hard to calculate. So I'm leaning towards (ii) being false. But I'm not entirely sure because maybe for very high-dimensional data or real-time data, it could be a problem. But I think in most cases, it's manageable, so (ii) is probably not true.

(iii) Information criteria represent an alternative approach to model order determination.
Yes, information criteria like AIC, BIC, etc., are definitely used to choose the order of ARIMA models. They provide a different way to select the best model based on penalized likelihood, so (iii) is true.

(iv) If applied correctly, the acf and pacf will always deliver unique model selections.
This seems a bit strong. I recall that sometimes the acf and pacf might suggest multiple possible models, especially if the patterns aren't very clear. For example, a model might have both AR and MA components, making it an ARMA model, and the acf and pacf might not be enough to uniquely determine the order. So (iv) is probably false because they don't always give a unique solution.

Now, let me recap:

(i) True
(ii) False
(iii) True
(iv) False

So looking at the options:

Option B is (i) and (iii) only. That matches because (i) is true, (ii) is false, (iii) is true, and (iv) is false.

Wait, let me double-check. Option B is (i) and (iii) only. So that's correct. The other options either include (ii) or (iv), which I think are false, so B is the right choice.

The correct answer is B: (i) and (iii) only.

Answer: B
