Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the volume of a container to store ethane under certain conditions. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, the problem states that I need to store 1500 pounds mass (lbm) of ethane (C₂H₆) at 160°F and a pressure of 1100 psig (gage pressure). I need to find the volume required, and the answer is one of the options from A to J.

I remember that when dealing with gases, the ideal gas law is often used, which is PV = nRT. But wait, I should check if ethane behaves ideally under these conditions. I think at high pressures, gases deviate from ideal behavior, but I'm not sure about the specifics here. Maybe I can proceed with the ideal gas law for now, and see if that gives me one of the options.

Wait, but wait. The pressure here is 1100 psig. Psig stands for pounds per square inch gauge, which means it's the pressure above atmospheric pressure. So I should convert this to absolute pressure because the ideal gas law uses absolute pressure. I think atmospheric pressure at sea level is about 14.7 psi. So the absolute pressure P would be 1100 + 14.7 = 1114.7 psia. I'll note that down as P = 1114.7 psia.

Next, the temperature is given in Fahrenheit. I need to convert that to Rankine because the ideal gas law uses absolute temperature. The conversion from Fahrenheit to Rankine is T(R) = T(°F) + 459.67. So 160°F would be 160 + 459.67 = 619.67 R. I'll write that as T = 619.67 R.

Now, the mass of ethane is 1500 lbm. To use the ideal gas law, I need the number of moles, n. The molar mass of ethane (C₂H₆) is calculated as follows: Carbon is 12.01 g/mol, so 2 carbons would be 24.02 g/mol. Hydrogen is about 1.008 g/mol, so 6 hydrogens are 6.048 g/mol. Adding those together, 24.02 + 6.048 = 30.068 g/mol, which is 0.030068 kg/mol. Wait, wait, no, 30.068 g/mol is 0.030068 kg/mol. But I'm working in pounds, so I should convert that molar mass into pounds per mole.

Wait, perhaps it's better to work in consistent units. Let me see. The mass is in lbm, and I need to find volume in cubic feet. So I think I should use the ideal gas law with units that match these. Alternatively, maybe use the specific form of the ideal gas law that uses pressure in psia, volume in cubic feet, and temperature in Rankine, with the specific gas constant.

Alternatively, I can use the general gas equation, but perhaps it's easier to use the specific version. The ideal gas law is PV = nRT, where R is the universal gas constant. But R has different values depending on the units. Let me recall the value of R in units suitable for this problem.

Wait, R is usually 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), but that's not matching here. Alternatively, I think R is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R). Wait, lbmol is pounds-mole, right? Because if the mass is in lbm, then the number of lbmol would be mass in lbm divided by the molar mass in lbm/lbmol.

Wait, that's correct. So first, let's find the number of lbmol of ethane. The molar mass of ethane is 30.068 g/mol, which is 0.030068 kg/mol. Converting to pounds, since 1 kg is about 2.20462 lbm, so 0.030068 kg/mol * 2.20462 lbm/kg = approximately 0.0663 lbm/mol. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 1 kg is 2.20462 lbm, so 1 kg/mol is 2.20462 lbm/mol. So the molar mass M is 30.068 g/mol = 0.030068 kg/mol = 0.0663 lbm/mol.

Wait, no, wait. Because 1 kg is 2.20462 lbm, so 0.030068 kg is 0.030068 * 2.20462 ≈ 0.0663 lbm. So the molar mass M is 0.0663 lbm per mole. But wait, the lbmol is the number of moles where the mass is equal to the molar mass in pounds. So 1 lbmol is 453.592 moles (since 1 lb = 453.592 grams, so 1 lbmol is 453.592 * 1 mol). Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the specific gas constant R in units that match psi, ft³, and lbm. I think R for ethane is approximately 43.583 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R). Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the specific gas constant for ethane, but since I don't have that, maybe I should proceed with the ideal gas law in terms of lbm.

Wait, I think the correct approach is to use the ideal gas law in the form:

PV = (m / M) * R * T

Where:
- P is pressure in psia
- V is volume in ft³
- m is mass in lbm
- M is molar mass in lbm/lbmol
- R is the universal gas constant in (psi·ft³)/(lbmol·R)
- T is temperature in Rankine

So first, let's compute M, the molar mass of ethane. As before, C is 12.01 lbm/lbmol (since 12.01 g/mol = 0.02402 lbm/mol, but wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, the molar mass in lbm per lbmol. Wait, 1 lbmole is the amount of substance whose mass is equal to the molar mass in pounds. So for ethane, C₂H₆, molar mass M = 2*12.01 + 6*1.008 = 24.02 + 6.048 = 30.068 g/mol. Converting grams to pounds: 30.068 g/mol = 0.030068 kg/mol = 0.0663 lbm/mol. Wait, no, because 1 kg is 2.20462 lbm, so 0.030068 kg = 0.030068 * 2.20462 ≈ 0.0663 lbm. So M = 0.0663 lbm/lbmol.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. The molar mass M is 30.068 g/mol, which is 30.068 / 453.592 lbm/lbmol, since 1 g is 0.00220462 lbm, so 30.068 g is 30.068 * 0.00220462 ≈ 0.0663 lbm. So M = 0.0663 lbm/lbmol.

Now, R for ethane is the specific gas constant, which is R = 8.314 J/(mol·K) converted to appropriate units. Wait, but I think it's better to use R = 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R). Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the specific gas constant for ethane. Alternatively, I can use the relation R = 10.7316 * M, where M is in lbm/lbmol. Wait, no, the specific gas constant R is R = 8.314 J/(mol·K) * (1 psi·ft³/(J)) * (1 R/K) * (1 lbmol/(kgmol)) * (M in kg/mol). Hmm, this is getting complicated, maybe I should try a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the ideal gas law in the form PV = mRT/(M), where R is the universal gas constant in units that match. Let me think. R is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R). So if I have m in lbm, M in lbm/lbmol, then (m/M) gives lbmol. So the equation becomes PV = (m/M) * R * T.

So let me plug in the numbers:

P = 1114.7 psia
V = ? ft³
m = 1500 lbm
M = 0.0663 lbm/lbmol
R = 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R)
T = 619.67 R

So rearranging the equation to solve for V:

V = (m * R * T) / (P * M)

Plugging in the numbers:

V = (1500 lbm * 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R) * 619.67 R) / (1114.7 psia * 0.0663 lbm/lbmol)

Let me compute the numerator and denominator step by step.

First, compute the numerator:

1500 * 10.7316 = 1500 * ~10.73 ≈ 16097.4

16097.4 * 619.67 ≈ Let's approximate this. 16097.4 * 600 = 9,658,440, and 16097.4 * 19.67 ≈ ~317,550, so total is roughly 9,658,440 + 317,550 ≈ 9,976,000.

Wait, that's a rough estimate. Let me calculate more accurately:

10.7316 * 619.67 = Let's compute 10 * 619.67 = 6196.7, 0.7316 * 619.67 ≈ 453. So total is approximately 6196.7 + 453 ≈ 6650.

So 1500 * 6650 ≈ 9,975,000.

Now the denominator:

1114.7 * 0.0663 ≈ Let's compute 1114.7 * 0.06 = 66.882, 1114.7 * 0.0063 ≈ 7.045. So total ≈ 66.882 + 7.045 ≈ 73.927.

So V ≈ 9,975,000 / 73.927 ≈ Let's compute that.

Dividing 9,975,000 by 73.927:

Well, 73.927 * 135,000 ≈ 73.927 * 100,000 = 7,392,700

73.927 * 35,000 ≈ 73.927 *30,000=2,217,810; 73.927 *5,000=369,635 → total 2,217,810 +369,635=2,587,445.

So 7,392,700 + 2,587,445 = 9,980,145. That's close to 9,975,000. So 135,000 would give 9,980,145, which is a bit higher. So perhaps 134,700 or so.

Wait, but maybe I should compute it more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps use a calculator approach.

Alternatively, let's compute 9,975,000 ÷ 73.927.

Dividing 9,975,000 by 73.927:

73.927 × 135,000 = 73.927 × 1.35e5 = let's compute:

73.927 × 100,000 = 7,392,700

73.927 × 35,000 = 73.927 ×3e4=2,217,810, 73.927×5e3=369,635 → total 2,217,810 +369,635=2,587,445

So total for 135,000 is 7,392,700 + 2,587,445 = 9,980,145.

But our numerator is 9,975,000, which is 5,145 less than 9,980,145.

So 135,000 - (5,145 /73.927) → 5,145 ÷73.927 ≈ 69.8.

So approximately 135,000 - 70 ≈ 134,930.

Wait, but wait. Wait, no: because 73.927 × 70 ≈ 5,174.89, which is a bit more than 5,145. So perhaps around 69.5.

So 73.927 ×69.5 ≈ 73.927*(70-0.5)=5,174.89 - 36.96≈5,137.93.

That's very close to 5,145. So the adjustment is about 69.5.

So the volume V ≈ 135,000 - 69.5 ≈ 134,930.5 ft³.

Wait, that can't be right because the options are all in the 100s. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait a minute, that result seems way too high. The options are between about 110 and 180.4 ft³. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's go back. Maybe I messed up the units somewhere.

Wait, let's recalculate the equation:

V = (m * R * T) / (P * M)

Given:

m = 1500 lbm

R = 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R)

T = 619.67 R

P = 1114.7 psia

M = 0.0663 lbm/lbmol

So:

V = (1500 * 10.7316 * 619.67) / (1114.7 * 0.0663)

Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

First, compute numerator: 1500 * 10.7316 * 619.67

1500 * 10.7316 = 1500 * ~10.73 = 16,095.9

16,095.9 * 619.67 ≈ Let's compute 16,095.9 * 600 = 9,657,540

16,095.9 * 19.67 ≈ Let's compute 16,095.9 * 20 = 321,918, but subtract 16,095.9 * 0.33 ≈ 5,311.65 → 321,918 - 5,311.65 ≈ 316,606.35

So total numerator ≈ 9,657,540 + 316,606.35 ≈ 9,974,146.35

Now denominator: 1114.7 * 0.0663 ≈ 1114.7 * 0.06 = 66.882, 1114.7 * 0.0063 ≈ 7.045 → Total ≈ 66.882 +7.045 ≈ 73.927.

So V ≈ 9,974,146.35 / 73.927 ≈ Let's compute that.

9,974,146.35 ÷ 73.927 ≈ Let me see, 73.927 × 135,000 ≈ 9,980,145 as before. So our numerator is about 9,974,146, which is about 9,980,145 - 6,000.

So 73.927 × 135,000 ≈ 9,980,145.

So 9,974,146 is 9,980,145 - 6,000, so it's 135,000 - (6,000 /73.927) ≈ 135,000 - 81.2 ≈ 134,918.8 ft³.

Wait, that's about 134,919 ft³, which is way larger than any of the options given. The options are all under 200, but 134k is way off. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong value for R. Alternatively, maybe I should have used a different approach. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the ideal gas law in terms of pressure in psia, volume in ft³, and temperature in Rankine, but with the molar mass correctly accounted for.

Wait, another approach: use the ideal gas law as PV = nRT, where n is the number of moles, R is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R), and n = m / M, where m is mass in lbm and M is molar mass in lbm/lbmol.

Wait, so n = 1500 lbm / 0.0663 lbm/lbmol ≈ 1500 / 0.0663 ≈ 22,624 lbmol.

Then, PV = nRT → V = (nRT)/(P)

So V = (22,624 lbmol * 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R) * 619.67 R) / 1114.7 psia

Compute numerator: 22,624 * 10.7316 ≈ Let's compute 22,624 * 10 = 226,240, 22,624 * 0.7316 ≈ 16,485. So total ≈ 226,240 + 16,485 ≈ 242,725.

242,725 * 619.67 ≈ Let's approximate this. 242,725 * 600 = 145,635,000, 242,725 * 19.67 ≈ 4,775,000. So total ≈ 145,635,000 + 4,775,000 ≈ 150,410,000.

Now divide by 1114.7: 150,410,000 / 1114.7 ≈ Let's see, 1114.7 * 135,000 ≈ 150,410,000. So V ≈ 135,000 ft³, which again is way too high compared to the options given.

Hmm, this can't be right. The options are all under 200, so I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong units for R. Let me check the value of R again. I think R is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R) when using lbm and lbmol. Alternatively, perhaps I should use R in different units.

Wait, another approach: perhaps use the ideal gas law with pressure in psia, volume in ft³, and temperature in Rankine, but use the molar mass correctly.

Wait, perhaps I can use the general gas equation where R is in terms of (psi·ft³)/(lbmol·R). So let me try again.

Compute n = m / M = 1500 lbm / 0.0663 lbm/lbmol ≈ 22,624 lbmol.

Then, PV = nRT → V = (nRT)/P.

So V = (22,624 lbmol * 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R) * 619.67 R) / 1114.7 psia.

Compute numerator: 22,624 * 10.7316 = 242,725 (as before)

242,725 * 619.67 ≈ 150,410,000 (as before)

Divide by 1114.7: 150,410,000 / 1114.7 ≈ 135,000 ft³.

This is the same result as before, which can't be right because the options are much smaller. So I must be making a mistake in the units.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong value for R. Let me check the correct value for R in these units.

Upon reflection, I think the specific gas constant R for ethane is approximately 43.583 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R). Wait, no, that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps R is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R).

Wait, maybe I should look up the specific gas constant for ethane. I think for ethane, the specific gas constant R is about 43.583 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R). Hmm, but that seems high. Alternatively, maybe it's 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R).

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the universal gas constant R = 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R), which is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should use the conversion factor to convert the equation into consistent units. Maybe using the ideal gas law with pressure in psia, volume in ft³, temperature in Rankine, and mass in lbm.

Wait, another approach: use the ideal gas law in terms of pressure in psia, volume in ft³, temperature in Rankine, and mass in lbm, with the equation:

V = (m / M) * (R * T) / P

Where:
- m = 1500 lbm
- M = 0.0663 lbm/lbmol
- R = 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R)
- T = 619.67 R
- P = 1114.7 psia

So let's compute (m / M) first: 1500 / 0.0663 ≈ 22,624 lbmol.

Then, (R * T) = 10.7316 * 619.67 ≈ 10.7316 * 600 ≈ 6,438.96 and 10.7316 *19.67≈211. So total ≈ 6,438.96 + 211 ≈ 6,650.

Then, (m/M) * (R*T) = 22,624 * 6,650 ≈ 22,624 * 6,000 = 135,744,000 and 22,624 * 650 ≈ 14,705,600 → total ≈ 150,449,600.

Now divide by P = 1114.7: 150,449,600 / 1114.7 ≈ 135,000 ft³, which again is way too high.

This suggests that I'm making a mistake somewhere, perhaps in the units or the approach.

Wait, maybe I should try using the ideal gas law with different units. Let me try using R in J/(mol·K) and convert everything to SI units, then convert back to ft³.

So, let's try that approach.

First, convert all units to SI:

- Pressure P = 1100 psig + 14.7 psi = 1114.7 psi. Convert to Pascals: 1 psi = 6,894.76 Pa, so 1114.7 psi * 6,894.76 ≈ 7,680,000 Pa.

- Temperature T = 160°F + 459.67 = 619.67 R, which is 619.67 * 5/9 = 344.2 K.

- Mass m = 1500 lbm * 0.453592 kg/lbm = 680.388 kg.

- Molar mass M = 30.068 g/mol = 0.030068 kg/mol.

Now, the ideal gas law is PV = nRT.

n = m / M = 680.388 kg / 0.030068 kg/mol ≈ 22,624 mol.

R = 8.314 J/(mol·K).

So, V = nRT / P.

Compute nRT: 22,624 mol * 8.314 J/(mol·K) * 344.2 K.

Compute 22,624 * 8.314 ≈ 22,624 *8=181, 22,624*0.314≈7,081 → total ≈ 181,000 +7,081≈188,081 J/K.

Multiply by 344.2 K: 188,081 * 344.2 ≈ Let's approximate: 188,081 * 300 = 56,424,300; 188,081 *44.2 ≈ 8,298,  → total ≈ 56,424,300 + 8,298,000 ≈ 64,722,300 J.

Now, P = 7,680,000 Pa.

So V = 64,722,300 J / 7,680,000 Pa = 64,722,300 / 7,680,000 ≈ 8.43 m³.

Convert m³ to ft³: 1 m³ ≈ 35.3147 ft³. So 8.43 m³ * 35.3147 ≈ 298 ft³.

Wait, that's about 298 ft³, which is still higher than the options given. But the options are all under 200. So I must have made a mistake again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the SI unit calculation. Let me check each step again.

Wait, let's redo the SI approach more carefully.

Compute P in Pascals:

P = 1114.7 psi * 6,894.76 Pa/psi = 1114.7 * 6,894.76 ≈ Let's compute 1000 *6,894.76=6,894,760; 114.7 *6,894.76≈ let's compute 100 *6,894.76=689,476; 14.7 *6,894.76≈100,780. So total P ≈ 6,894,760 + 689,476 + 100,780 ≈ 7,685,016 Pa.

Temperature T: 619.67 R = 619.67 * 5/9 = 619.67 * 0.555556 ≈ 344.26 K.

Mass m = 1500 lbm * 0.453592 kg/lbm = 1500 * 0.453592 ≈ 680.388 kg.

Molar mass M = 30.068 g/mol = 0.030068 kg/mol.

Number of moles n = m/M = 680.388 / 0.030068 ≈ Let's compute 680.388 / 0.03 = 22,679.6 → since 0.030068 is slightly more than 0.03, n ≈ 22,624 mol.

R = 8.314 J/(mol·K).

Compute nRT:

nRT = 22,624 * 8.314 * 344.2.

First, 22,624 * 8.314 ≈ Let's compute 22,624 *8 = 180,992; 22,624 *0.314 ≈ 7,083 → total ≈ 188,075 J/(mol·K) * K = J.

Wait, no, nRT is in J because R is in J/(mol·K) and T is in K.

So nRT = 22,624 * 8.314 * 344.2.

Compute 22,624 *8.314 ≈ 22,624 *8 = 180,992; 22,624 *0.314 ≈ 7,083 → total ≈ 188,075 J.

Now multiply by 344.2: 188,075 * 344.2 ≈ Let's compute 188,075 *300 = 56,422,500; 188,075 *44.2 ≈ 8,299, 000. So total ≈ 56,422,500 + 8,299,000 ≈ 64,721,500 J.

Now, P = 7,685,016 Pa.

So V = nRT / P = 64,721,500 J / 7,685,016 Pa ≈ 8.425 m³.

Convert to ft³: 8.425 m³ * 35.3147 ft³/m³ ≈ 8.425 *35.3147 ≈ 297.7 ft³.

Wait, that's the same as before, around 298 ft³, which is not matching any of the options. So I must be doing something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong value for R. Alternatively, maybe I should use the specific gas constant for ethane in the equation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the container is not rigid, and the gas is compressed, so I should consider deviations from ideal gas behavior. But at 1100 psig, which is about 75 bar, ethane might not behave ideally. But I'm not sure how to account for that without more data.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me try using the ideal gas law with pressure in psia, volume in ft³, and using the specific gas constant R for ethane.

Wait, I think the specific gas constant R for ethane is approximately 43.583 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R). Let me try that.

So R = 43.583 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R).

Now, using the equation:

V = (m / M) * (R * T) / P

Where m=1500 lbm, M=0.0663 lbm/lbmol, R=43.583, T=619.67 R, P=1114.7 psia.

Compute (m/M) = 1500 / 0.0663 ≈ 22,624 lbmol.

Then, (R*T) = 43.583 * 619.67 ≈ Let's compute 43.583 *600=26,150, 43.583*19.67≈853 → total ≈26,150 +853≈27,003.

Now, (m/M)*(R*T) = 22,624 *27,003 ≈ Let's compute 22,624*27,000=610,848,000 and 22,624*3=67,872 → total ≈610,848,000 +67,872≈610,915,872.

Now, divide by P=1114.7: 610,915,872 /1114.7 ≈ Let's compute.

1114.7 *548,000= 1114.7*500,000=557,350,000; 1114.7*48,000≈53,499,600 → total≈557,350,000 +53,499,600≈610,849,600.

So, 548,000 *1114.7≈610,849,600.

Subtract from numerator: 610,915,872 -610,849,600≈66,272.

Now, 66,272 /1114.7≈60.

So total V≈548,000 +60≈548,060 ft³. That's way too high again.

Wait, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake in the value of R. Maybe R is not 43.583 but something else. Alternatively, perhaps I should use R = 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R).

Wait, let me try R=10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R).

So, R=10.7316.

Compute (R*T) =10.7316 *619.67≈6,650.

(m/M)=22,624.

So (m/M)*(R*T)=22,624*6,650≈150,449,600.

Divide by P=1114.7: 150,449,600 /1114.7≈135,000 ft³.

Again, same result as before, which is way too high. So I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong value for the specific gas constant R. I think I should look it up or find another way.

Wait, perhaps I can use the ideal gas law in terms of specific volume. Alternatively, maybe I should use the compressibility factor Z to correct for non-ideal behavior, but without Z, I can't do that.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the molar mass calculation. Let me double-check.

Molar mass of ethane (C₂H₆):

C: 12.01 g/mol *2 =24.02 g/mol.

H:1.008 g/mol *6=6.048 g/mol.

Total:24.02 +6.048=30.068 g/mol.

Convert to lbm/lbmol: 30.068 g/mol * (1 lbm / 453.592 g) =30.068 /453.592 ≈0.0663 lbm/lbmol. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the ideal gas law in terms of lbm and lbmol. Let me think.

Another approach: use the ideal gas law as PV = (m/M) RT, where m is mass, M is molar mass, R is the universal gas constant in appropriate units.

So, m=1500 lbm, M=0.0663 lbm/lbmol.

R=10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R).

So, V = (m/(M R)) * RT / P.

Wait, no, the equation is V = (m/(M)) * (R T)/P.

Which is what I did earlier, leading to V≈135,000 ft³, which can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the specific gas constant R in the wrong way. Maybe I should use the general gas constant R in different units.

Wait, perhaps the correct value for R in psi·ft³/(lbmol·R) is 10.7316, as I thought earlier.

But this leads to a volume that's way too high, which suggests that I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for volume in cubic feet, but I'm getting it in a different unit.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the pressure is given as 1100 psig, which is the gauge pressure, so absolute pressure is 1100 + 14.7 = 1114.7 psia. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the ideal gas law with R in terms of (ft³·psia)/(lbm·R), which would be different.

Wait, perhaps I can find R in those units. Let me think: R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), which is 8.314 (m³·Pa)/(mol·K). But converting to psi and ft³ would be complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the fact that 1 atm = 14.7 psia, and 1 atm is 22.414 L at 0°C, but that's for ideal gas under standard conditions.

Wait, maybe I can use the conversion factor.

Wait, another approach: use the ideal gas law in the form:

V (ft³) = (m (lbm) * 14.414) / (P (psia)) * T (°F + 459.67) / (M (lbm/lbmol)))

Wait, I'm not sure about that formula. Alternatively, perhaps use the conversion factor for the ideal gas law in English units.

Wait, I think the correct formula when using:

- P in psia,
- V in ft³,
- T in °F,
- m in lbm,
- M in lbm/lbmol,

is:

V = (m / M) * (R * (T + 459.67)) / P

Where R is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R).

So, plugging in the numbers:

V = (1500 / 0.0663) * (10.7316 * (160 + 459.67)) / 1114.7

Compute step by step:

1500 / 0.0663 ≈22,624 lbmol.

T +459.67 = 160 +459.67=619.67 R.

10.7316 *619.67 ≈6,650.

So, 22,624 *6,650 = 150,449,000.

Divide by 1114.7: 150,449,000 /1114.7≈135,000 ft³.

Same result as before. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm supposed to use the molar volume at standard conditions and adjust for pressure and temperature. Let me think.

At standard temperature and pressure (STP), which is 60°F and 14.7 psia, the volume per lbm of ethane can be calculated, then adjust for the given conditions.

The molar volume at STP would be 22.414 ft³/lbmol. So for 1 lbm, it would be 22.414 / M, where M is 0.0663 lbm/lbmol.

So, 22.414 ft³/lbmol / 0.0663 lbm/lbmol ≈ 338.3 ft³/lbm.

But wait, that can't be right because at STP, 1 lbm of ethane would occupy 338.3 ft³, which seems high.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing units. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the ideal gas law at STP and then use the combined gas law to find the volume at the given conditions.

At STP (14.7 psia, 60°F):

V1 = (m / M) * (R * T1) / P1

m=1500 lbm,

M=0.0663 lbm/lbmol,

R=10.7316,

T1=60+459.67=519.67 R,

P1=14.7 psia.

So V1 = (1500 /0.0663) * (10.7316 *519.67) /14.7

Compute:

1500/0.0663≈22,624.

10.7316 *519.67≈5,560.

So 22,624 *5,560≈125,730,000.

Divide by 14.7: 125,730,000 /14.7≈8,568,000 ft³.

Wait, that's way too high. That can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the specific volume approach.

Wait, specific volume is volume per unit mass. At STP, specific volume v1 = R*T1/(P1*M).

So v1 = (10.7316 *519.67) / (14.7 *0.0663).

Compute numerator:10.7316 *519.67≈5,560.

Denominator:14.7 *0.0663≈0.975.

So v1≈5,560 /0.975≈5,700 ft³/lbm.

At the given conditions, P2=1114.7 psia, T2=619.67 R.

The specific volume v2 = v1 * (P1/P2) * (T2/T1).

So v2 =5,700 * (14.7/1114.7) * (619.67/519.67).

Compute each part:

14.7/1114.7≈0.01319.

619.67/519.67≈1.1925.

So v2=5,700 *0.01319 *1.1925≈5,700 *0.01575≈89.625 ft³/lbm.

Then, total volume V= m *v2=1500 *89.625≈134,437.5 ft³.

Again, way too high.

This is perplexing. All approaches are leading to a volume around 135,000 ft³, but the options are all under 200. So perhaps I'm using the wrong units somewhere.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the pressure given is 1100 psig, which is gauge pressure, but when converted to absolute, it's 1100 +14.7=1114.7 psia. But perhaps the problem expects me to use 1100 psia instead of psig. Let me check.

If P=1100 psia, then:

V= (1500/0.0663) * (10.7316 *619.67)/1100.

Compute numerator:22,624 *6,650≈150,449,000.

Divide by 1100:150,449,000 /1100≈136,772 ft³. Still way too high.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the ideal gas law with pressure in psia, but in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the units for R.

Wait, perhaps R is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·°R), which I think it is. So maybe I should proceed differently.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the container's volume is to be found at standard conditions, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the density of ethane at the given conditions.

Density ρ = m/V → V = m/ρ.

The density of ethane can be found using the ideal gas law: ρ = (P M)/(R T).

So, ρ = (1114.7 psia * 0.0663 lbm/lbmol) / (10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R) *619.67 R).

Compute numerator:1114.7 *0.0663≈73.927.

Denominator:10.7316 *619.67≈6,650.

So ρ ≈73.927 /6,650 ≈0.01111 lbm/ft³.

Then, V =1500 /0.01111 ≈135,000 ft³.

Again, same result. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the answer options are wrong, or the question has a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a unit conversion.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should convert the pressure from psig to psia correctly. Wait, 1100 psig +14.7 psi=1114.7 psia. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. The options are from about 110 to 180 ft³. Maybe the correct answer is option B: 180.40 ft³.

But according to my calculations, it's around 135,000 ft³, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use the molar volume at the given conditions.

Molar volume Vm = RT/P.

R=10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R).

T=619.67 R.

P=1114.7 psia.

Vm=10.7316 *619.67 /1114.7≈(6,650)/1114.7≈6 ft³/lbmol.

So for 1500 lbm, number of lbmol is 1500 /0.0663≈22,624 lbmol.

Total volume V=22,624 *6≈135,744 ft³. Same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different value for R, such as R=10.7316 (psi·ft³)/(lbmol·R) but with different units.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the general gas equation with the correct units.

Wait, perhaps I should use R=8.314 kJ/(kmol·K), but that would require converting all units to metric, which I tried earlier, leading to about 298 ft³, still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation when using SI units. Let me double-check.

In SI units:

P=7,685,016 Pa,

T=344.26 K,

m=680.388 kg,

M=0.030068 kg/mol,

R=8.314 J/(mol·K).

n=m/M=680.388 /0.030068≈22,624 mol.

V=nRT/P=22,624 *8.314 *344.26 /7,685,016.

Compute numerator:22,624 *8.314≈188,075; 188,075 *344.26≈64,721,500 J.

V=64,721,500 /7,685,016≈8.425 m³.

Convert to ft³:8.425 *35.3147≈297.7 ft³.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the container is at 1100 psig, which is a very high pressure, so the volume is smaller, but my calculation says it's around 135,000 ft³, which is way too high.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the ideal gas law in terms of pressure in bar or another unit, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. The options are from about 110 to 180.4 ft³. Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation by a factor of 1000 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that 1 lbmol is 453.592 moles, so when I calculated V in ft³ using lbmol, it's correct, but perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion.

Wait, perhaps I should use the ideal gas law in terms of pressure in psia, volume in ft³, and temperature in Rankine, but with the correct molar mass.

Wait, perhaps I should use the specific gas constant R = 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R) and compute V as:

V = (m / M) * (R * T) / P.

So,

V = (1500 /0.0663) * (10.7316 *619.67) /1114.7.

Compute step by step:

1500 /0.0663 ≈22,624 lbmol.

10.7316 *619.67≈6,650.

So,

22,624 *6,650 = 150,449,000.

Divide by 1114.7:150,449,000 /1114.7≈135,000 ft³.

Same result. So I'm not making progress.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B: 180.40 ft³, but I can't see how to get that number. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation by a factor of 1000 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the specific volume in ft³/lbm and then multiply by mass.

Specific volume v = RT/(P M).

v=10.7316 *619.67 / (1114.7 *0.0663)≈6,650 /73.927≈90.0 ft³/lbm.

Then V=1500 *90≈135,000 ft³.

Same result.

Wait, I'm stuck. All approaches lead to 135,000 ft³, but the options don't include that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Maybe the problem expects me to use the molar volume at standard conditions and adjust for pressure and temperature.

At standard conditions (14.7 psia, 60°F):

Molar volume Vm=22.414 ft³/lbmol.

At given conditions:

Vm' = Vm * (T2/T1) * (P1/P2).

So,

Vm' =22.414 * (619.67/519.67) * (14.7/1114.7).

Compute:

619.67/519.67≈1.1925,

14.7/1114.7≈0.01319.

So,

Vm' ≈22.414 *1.1925 *0.01319≈22.414 *0.01572≈0.352 ft³/lbmol.

Then, number of lbmol =1500 /0.0663≈22,624 lbmol.

Total volume V=22,624 *0.352≈7,958 ft³.

Still way too high.

Wait, perhaps I should use the ideal gas law with different units for R.

Wait, I think I might have found the issue. Earlier, I used R=10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R), but perhaps the correct value is R=43.583 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R).

Let me try with R=43.583.

So,

V = (1500 /0.0663) * (43.583 *619.67) /1114.7.

Compute:

1500/0.0663≈22,624.

43.583 *619.67≈26,900.

22,624 *26,900≈608,  22,624 *26,900=22,624 *20,000=452,480,000; 22,624 *6,900≈156,  22,624*6,900=22,624*(7,000-100)=22,624*7,000=158,368,000 minus 22,624*100=2,262,400 →158,368,000-2,262,400=156,105,600. So total≈452,480,000 +156,105,600≈608,585,600.

Divide by 1114.7:608,585,600 /1114.7≈546,000 ft³. Still way too high.

Wait, perhaps R is 10.7316 (psi·ft³)/(lbmol·R), but I'm using it correctly. So I'm stuck.

Given that all my calculations lead to a volume around 135,000 ft³, but the options are much lower, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the problem expects me to use the specific volume in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the pressure is given in psig but I'm supposed to use it as absolute pressure. No, that's not correct. Psig is gauge pressure, so absolute pressure is psig +14.7.

Wait, perhaps the temperature conversion is wrong. Let me check:

160°F + 459.67=619.67 R. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the molar mass is wrong. Let me check again.

Ethane: C₂H₆.

Carbon:12.01 g/mol *2=24.02 g/mol.

Hydrogen:1.008 g/mol *6=6.048 g/mol.

Total:30.068 g/mol=0.030068 kg/mol=0.0663 lbm/lbmol. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the ideal gas law in terms of pressure in bars and volume in liters, then convert to ft³.

But that would require more steps and I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the volume at standard conditions and adjust using the pressure ratio.

At standard conditions (14.7 psia, 60°F):

V1= (m / M) * (R * T1) / P1.

m=1500 lbm,

M=0.0663 lbm/lbmol,

R=10.7316,

T1=60+459.67=519.67 R,

P1=14.7 psia.

V1= (1500/0.0663) * (10.7316 *519.67)/14.7.

Compute:

1500/0.0663≈22,624.

10.7316 *519.67≈5,560.

So,

22,624 *5,560≈125,730,000.

Divide by 14.7:125,730,000 /14.7≈8,568,000 ft³.

Then, at the given conditions (P2=1114.7 psia, T2=619.67 R), the volume V2= V1 * (P1/P2) * (T2/T1).

So,

V2=8,568,000 * (14.7/1114.7) * (619.67/519.67).

Compute:

14.7/1114.7≈0.01319,

619.67/519.67≈1.1925.

So,

V2=8,568,000 *0.01319 *1.1925≈8,568,000 *0.01575≈134,430 ft³.

Again, same result.

I'm stuck. All methods give around 135,000 ft³, which isn't among the options. Perhaps the correct answer is option B: 180.40 ft³, but I can't see how to get that number. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that ethane is a liquid under high pressure, but at 160°F, it's likely gaseous. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different value for R, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should use R=43.583 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R) and see what happens.

V=(1500/0.0663)*(43.583*619.67)/1114.7.

Compute:

1500/0.0663≈22,624.

43.583*619.67≈26,900.

22,624 *26,900≈608,585,600.

Divide by 1114.7:608,585,600 /1114.7≈546,000 ft³. Still way too high.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option B: 180.40 ft³, but I don't know how to reach that number. I might have to choose the closest option, but I can't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation by a factor of 1000. Let me check.

Wait, perhaps I should use R=10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R), but divide by 1000 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should compute V in ft³ correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute V= (1500 lbm * 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R) * 619.67 R) / (1114.7 psia * 0.0663 lbm/lbmol).

Compute numerator:1500 *10.7316=16,097.4.

16,097.4 *619.67≈9,975,000.

Denominator:1114.7 *0.0663≈73.927.

So V=9,975,000 /73.927≈135,000 ft³.

Same result.

I think I have to conclude that none of the options match my calculation, but perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option B: 180.40 ft³, but I can't see how to get there.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the volume of a container required to store 1500 lbm of ethane (C₂H₆) at 160°F and a pressure of 1100 psig (gage pressure). The ideal gas law, PV = nRT, is used to determine the volume, where pressure is converted to absolute (1114.7 psia), temperature to Rankine (619.67 R), and the molar mass of ethane is 0.0663 lbm/lbmol. Using the specific gas constant \( R = 10.7316 \, \text{psi·ft}^3/(\text{lbmol·R}) \), the calculation leads to a volume of approximately 135,000 ft³, which is far higher than any of the provided options. Despite multiple approaches and unit conversions, the result remains inconsistent with the given choices. Given the options, the closest plausible answer based on potential errors or approximations is **B: 180.40 ft³**.

**Answer: B**
