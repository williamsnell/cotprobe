Question:

This question refers to the following information.
All this while the Indians came skulking about them, and would sometimes show themselves aloof off, but when any approached near them, they would run away; and once they stole away their tools where they had been at work and were gone to dinner. But about the 16th of March, a certain Indian came boldly amongst them and spoke to them in broken English, which they could well understand but marveled at it. At length they understood by discourse with him, that he was not of these parts, but belonged to the eastern parts where some English ships came to fish, with whom he was acquainted and could name sundry of them by their names, amongst whom he had got his language. He became profitable to them in acquainting them with many things concerning the state of the country in the east parts where he lived, which was afterwards profitable unto them; as also of the people here, of their names, number and strength, of their situation and distance from the place, and who was chief amongst them. His name was Samoset. He told them also of another Indian whose name was Squanto, a native of this place, who had been in England and could speak better English than himself.

Okay, so I need to figure out which historical figure Samoset and Squanto can be most directly compared to from the given options. Let me start by recalling what I know about these individuals mentioned in the question.

First, the passage is from William Bradford's account of the Plymouth Plantation. It talks about two Native Americans, Samoset and Squanto. Samoset approached the English settlers, spoke to them in broken English, and provided valuable information about the local area and other tribes. Squanto, also known as Tisquantum, was a native of the area, had been to England, and spoke better English than Samoset. He was also a significant figure in helping the settlers.

Now, looking at the options, they are all prominent Native American leaders. I need to find someone who, like Samoset and Squanto, interacted with the English settlers, possibly helped them, and was a guide or interpreter.

Let's go through each option:

A: Sitting Bull - He was a Lakota leader known for resisting U.S. expansion, but I don't think he interacted with early settlers in the same way.

B: Crazy Horse - Another Lakota leader, also known for conflict with the U.S., not really a guide or interpreter.

C: Black Hawk - A Sauk leader who fought against the U.S., not known for helping settlers.

D: Chief Joseph - A Nez Perce leader known for his resistance and the famous "I will fight no more forever" speech, not a guide to settlers.

E: Tecumseh - A Shawnee leader who organized resistance against settlers, not a collaborator.

F: Red Cloud - A Lakota leader who signed treaties but also fought against the U.S., more about conflict than guiding.

G: Sacagawea - She was a Shoshone woman who guided Lewis and Clark during their expedition. She helped the explorers by translating and providing knowledge about the area. This seems similar to what Squanto and Samoset did for the Pilgrims.

H: Cochise - An Apache leader who fought against the U.S., not known for guiding settlers.

I: Geronimo - An Apache leader known for resistance, not a guide.

So, Sacagawea (G) seems to fit best because she, like Squanto and Samoset, acted as a guide and interpreter for the newcomers. She helped with communication and provided valuable information about the environment and local tribes, aiding in the success of the Lewis and Clark expedition. Similarly, Squanto helped the Pilgrims survive by teaching them farming techniques and acting as an interpreter.

Therefore, the answer should be G.
