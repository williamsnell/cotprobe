Question:

In a certain country, a person must be at least 16 years old to drive a car and must be at least 18 years old to vote. The variable age represents the age of a person as an integer. Which of the following expressions evaluates to true if the person is old enough to drive but not old enough to vote, and evaluates to false otherwise?
 I. (age ≥ 16) AND (age ≤ 18)
 II. (age ≥ 16) AND (NOT(age ≥ 18))
 III. (age < 18) AND (NOT(age < 16))

Options:

A: II only
B: I and II only
C: I and III only
D: II and III only

Okay, I need to solve this multiple-choice question about boolean expressions related to age. Let me read the problem carefully.

The question says: In a certain country, a person must be at least 16 to drive and at least 18 to vote. The variable 'age' is an integer representing a person's age. We need to find which expressions evaluate to true if the person is old enough to drive but not old enough to vote, and false otherwise.

So, the scenario is when a person can drive but can't vote. That means their age is 16 or older but younger than 18. So the condition is 16 ≤ age < 18.

Now, let's look at each expression:

I. (age ≥ 16) AND (age ≤ 18)
II. (age ≥ 16) AND (NOT (age ≥ 18))
III. (age < 18) AND (NOT (age < 16))

Let me evaluate each one.

Expression I: (age ≥16) and (age ≤18). This would be true for ages 16,17,18. But wait, the condition we want is when they can drive (≥16) but can't vote, which is age <18. So this expression includes age 18, which allows voting. So I is true for 16,17,18, but our desired scenario is only up to 17. So I is not correct because it includes 18, which is not allowed.

Expression II: (age ≥16) and NOT (age ≥18). Let's break it down. NOT (age ≥18) is the same as age <18. So the expression becomes (age ≥16) AND (age <18). Which is exactly the condition we want: 16 to 17 years old. So II is correct.

Expression III: (age <18) AND (NOT (age <16)). Let's simplify. NOT (age <16) is age ≥16. So the expression becomes (age <18) AND (age ≥16). Which is again 16 ≤ age <18, the same as our desired condition. So III is correct.

So II and III evaluate to true in the correct scenario, which is when the person can drive but not vote.

Looking at the options:

A: II only → No, because III is also correct.
B: I and II only → No, because I is incorrect.
C: I and III only → No, I is wrong.
D: II and III only → Yes, that's correct.

Wait, did I make a mistake with III? Let me double-check. 

III is (age <18) AND (NOT (age <16)) → NOT (age <16) is age ≥16. So yes, same as II. So II and III are both correct. So the answer is D: II and III only.

The correct expressions are II and III because they both accurately capture the condition where the person is at least 16 but under 18.

Answer: D
