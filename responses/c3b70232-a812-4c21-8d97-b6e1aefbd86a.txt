Okay, so I need to figure out what deindividuation is and how it's been tested. Let me start by breaking down the term. I remember that "deindividuation" has something to do with being in a group. I think it's when people lose their individual identity and start acting more as part of the group. But wait, is it about losing their sense of self or just conforming more?

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. Option A says it's a state where morality is enhanced when part of a large group. That doesn't sound right. I've heard that sometimes in groups, people might make riskier decisions, not necessarily more moral.

Option B mentions cognitive abilities improving due to anonymity. Hmm, I'm not sure. I thought deindividuation might cause people to act differently because they feel anonymous, but does that improve cognitive abilities? I don't recall that being a key point.

Option C says it's when a person feels a lessened sense of personal identity and decreased concern about others' opinions. That makes sense. When you're in a big group, you might feel like your individual actions don't matter as much, so you might act without worrying about personal judgment.

Option D talks about becoming more conscious of societal norms. That seems opposite. Deindividuation is more about losing individuality, not necessarily focusing more on societal norms.

Option E says it's about conforming to group behavior without anonymity. Wait, but I thought deindividuation often involves anonymity. If you're anonymous in a group, you might act differently because you don't feel personally accountable. So E might not be right because it doesn't mention anonymity.

Option F is increased self-awareness. That doesn't fit. Deindividuation is about losing individual focus, so more self-awareness doesn't seem right.

Option G says individuals lose critical thinking due to group influence. Maybe, but I think deindividuation is more about the sense of self rather than critical thinking ability. Not sure about this one.

Option H is about being more concerned about public image. That seems contradictory. If you're deindividuated, you might care less about personal image because you're part of a group.

Option I talks about increased responsibility for actions. That doesn't align with what I know. Deindividuation might lead to decreased accountability.

Option J mentions heightened aggression and impulsivity in groups, especially when in a group setting. I've heard about the link between group settings and more aggressive behavior, like in sports or riots. This could be related.

Wait, but I'm trying to remember the definition. Deindividuation is when a person's sense of individuality is reduced, so they might engage in behaviors they wouldn't alone. This can include things like antisocial behavior because they don't feel personally responsible.

Looking back at the options, C and J both seem relevant. C is about the loss of personal identity and concern for others' opinions, which fits the idea of losing individuality. J talks about aggression and impulsivity, which are outcomes of deindividuation but might not fully define the concept.

So the question asks what deindividuation is and how it's been tested. I think the correct definition is in option C. As for testing, experiments often involve comparing group behavior with individual behavior, like the classic Asch conformity experiments or Milgram's obedience experiments. These tests show how people behave differently when part of a group, supporting the idea of deindividuation.

Wait, but option E says individuals are more likely to conform without anonymity. That might be the case, but deindividuation usually involves anonymity. So maybe E is incorrect because it's about conforming without anonymity, which isn't the typical setup.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be option C.

Deindividuation refers to a state where a person's sense of individuality is diminished, often leading to a reduced concern for personal accountability and increased likelihood of engaging in behaviors that they might not exhibit alone. This phenomenon is typically associated with group settings, where individuals may feel anonymous and thus more disinhibited. 

Option C accurately captures this concept by describing it as a state where a person feels a lessened sense of personal identity and decreased concern about others' opinions. This aligns with the idea that deindividuation involves losing individuality and acting in ways that reflect the group rather than personal judgment. 

Testing deindividuation often involves experiments comparing individual behavior to group behavior, such as the Asch conformity experiments or Milgram's obedience studies, which highlight how people's actions can change when part of a group.
