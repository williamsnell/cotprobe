Question:

A container having a volume of 2.5 ft^3 initially contains oxygen gas at a pressure of 125 psia and a temperature of 75°F. Oxygen then leaks from the container until the pressure drops to 100 psia, while the temperature remains the same. Assuming ideal gas behavior, determine how many pounds of oxygen leaked out of the container.

Options:

A: -0.25 lbm
B: -0.347 lbm
C: -0.347 lbm.mol
D: -0.40 lbm
E: -0.45 lbm
F: -0.35 lbm
G: -0.50 lbm
H: -0.34 lbm
I: -0.30 lbm
J: -0.20 lbm

Answer:

Okay, so I have this problem here about oxygen leaking from a container, and I need to find out how many pounds of oxygen leaked out. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on gas laws, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the container has a volume of 2.5 cubic feet. Initially, the oxygen is at 125 psia and 75°F. Then it leaks until the pressure drops to 100 psia, and the temperature stays the same. They want the mass leaked, assuming ideal gas behavior.

I remember the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. But wait, pressure is in psia, which is pounds per square inch absolute. Volume is in cubic feet. Temperature is in Fahrenheit, but I think I need to convert that to an absolute temperature scale, probably Rankine since it's Fahrenheit.

So first, convert the temperature from Fahrenheit to Rankine. The formula is R = °F + 459.67. So 75°F is 75 + 459.67 = 534.67 R.

Next, I think I can use the ideal gas law before and after the leakage. Since the temperature remains constant, I can set up two equations and subtract the moles (or mass) to find the leaked amount.

Wait, but the container's volume doesn't change, right? So V is constant. Let me write down the initial and final states.

Initial state:
P1 = 125 psia
V = 2.5 ft³
T1 = 534.67 R

Final state:
P2 = 100 psia
V = 2.5 ft³
T2 = 534.67 R

Since T and V are constant, I can use the combined gas law, but for mass, maybe it's better to use the fact that n is proportional to P when T and V are constant.

Wait, no, because n (moles) is proportional to P when V and T are constant. So the initial moles n1 = P1 V / (RT), and final moles n2 = P2 V / (RT). The change in moles, Δn = n1 - n2, would be the moles leaked.

But I need the mass, not moles. Oxygen has a molar mass. Let me think, oxygen is O2, so molar mass M is 32 lbm/mol. Because each O atom is about 16 lbm/mol, so two atoms make 32.

So the initial mass m1 = n1 * M, and final mass m2 = n2 * M. The mass leaked is m1 - m2 = (n1 - n2) * M.

Alternatively, since m = nM, and m is proportional to n when M is constant, and n is proportional to P, so m is also proportional to P. So the ratio m1/m2 = P1/P2.

Wait, but that's only if V and T are constant, which they are. So m1 = (P1 / P2) * m2. Or m1 - m2 = m1 (1 - (P2/P1)).

Alternatively, calculate the initial and final masses separately and subtract.

Let me go through the steps:

1. Calculate n1 and n2 using PV = nRT.

But wait, the units need to be consistent. Let me check the units for each variable.

Pressure is in psia, which is pounds-force per square inch. Volume is in cubic feet. R is usually in (lbm·ft)/(lbm·mol·R) or something like that. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused about the units here.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the specific form of the ideal gas law with compatible units. Let me think about the units.

The ideal gas law in English units is often written as:

PV = nRT, where:
- P is in psia,
- V in cubic feet,
- n in lbm·mol⁻¹ (or lbmole),
- R is 10.73 psi·ft³/(lbm·mol·R).

Wait, no, I think R is 10.73 when using those units. Let me confirm. R is the universal gas constant, which is 10.73 psi·ft³/(lbm·mol·R). Yes, that's right.

So, R = 10.73 psi·ft³/(lbm·mol·R).

So, rearranging PV = nRT to solve for n:

n = PV / (RT)

So, for initial state:

n1 = (P1 * V) / (R * T)
= (125 psia * 2.5 ft³) / (10.73 psi·ft³/(lbm·mol·R) * 534.67 R)

Let me compute that. Let's compute the denominator first: 10.73 * 534.67 ≈ Let's calculate 10 * 534.67 is 5346.7, 0.73 * 534.67 ≈ 389.54. So total ≈ 5346.7 + 389.54 ≈ 5736.24.

So denominator is about 5736.24.

So numerator is 125 * 2.5 = 312.5.

So n1 ≈ 312.5 / 5736.24 ≈ approximately 0.05446 lbm·mol⁻¹. Wait, but lbm·mol⁻¹ is the same as lbmole? Hmm, perhaps I should clarify. Alternatively, n is in moles, but using the specific R in these units, n is in lbm·mol⁻¹, which might be a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the mass directly. Since m = n * M, and M is 32 lbm/mol.

But perhaps I can compute m1 = (P1 * V) / (R * T) * M.

Because n = (P V)/(R T), so m = n M = (P V M)/(R T).

So m1 = (125 * 2.5 * 32) / (10.73 * 534.67)

Compute numerator: 125 * 2.5 = 312.5. 312.5 *32 = 10,000.

Denominator: 10.73 * 534.67 ≈ same as before, about 5736.24.

So m1 ≈ 10,000 / 5736.24 ≈ 1.745 lbm.

Similarly, m2 = (100 * 2.5 *32) / (10.73 *534.67)

Compute numerator: 100 *2.5=250. 250 *32=8,000.

Denominator same as before, 5736.24.

So m2 ≈ 8,000 / 5736.24 ≈ 1.394 lbm.

So mass leaked is m1 - m2 = 1.745 - 1.394 ≈ 0.351 lbm.

Wait, but let me check the calculations more accurately.

Let me compute denominator exactly: 10.73 * 534.67.

10 * 534.67 = 5346.7

0.73 * 534.67:

Calculate 0.7 * 534.67 = 374.269

0.03 * 534.67 = 16.0401

Total 374.269 +16.0401=390.3091

So total denominator: 5346.7 +390.3091=5737.0091 ≈5737.01.

So denominator is 5737.01.

Now compute m1:

Numerator: 125 *2.5 = 312.5. *32=10,000.

m1=10,000 /5737.01≈1.745 lbm.

m2: 100 *2.5=250 *32=8,000. m2=8,000 /5737.01≈1.394 lbm.

So difference is 1.745 -1.394=0.351 lbm.

Looking at the options, option F is -0.35 lbm. But wait, options B and F are similar, but let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: -0.25 lbm

B: -0.347 lbm

C: -0.347 lbm.mol

D: -0.40 lbm

E: -0.45 lbm

F: -0.35 lbm

G: -0.50 lbm

H: -0.34 lbm

I: -0.30 lbm

J: -0.20 lbm

So my calculation gives about 0.351 lbm, which is approximately 0.35 lbm, which is option F.

Wait, but option B is -0.347 lbm and option F is -0.35 lbm. Hmm, perhaps I should check the calculation more precisely.

Let me recalculate m1 and m2 with more precise numbers.

Compute denominator: 10.73 * 534.67.

Let me compute 10.73 *534.67:

10 * 534.67 = 5346.7

0.73 * 534.67:

Compute 0.7 *534.67 = 374.269

0.03 *534.67 =16.0401

Total: 374.269 +16.0401 =390.3091

So total denominator is 5346.7 +390.3091=5737.0091.

Now, m1=10,000 /5737.0091.

Let me compute 10,000 ÷ 5737.0091.

Using calculator steps:

5737.0091 × 1.745 ≈ 10,000.

But let's compute 5737.0091 × 1.745:

1.745 ×5737 ≈ let's compute:

1 ×5737=5737

0.7 ×5737=4015.9

0.04 ×5737=229.48

0.005 ×5737=28.685

So adding up:

5737 +4015.9=9752.9

+229.48=9982.38

+28.685=10,011.065.

Hmm, that's a bit over 10,000. So 1.745 gives about 10,011, which is a bit over. So perhaps m1 is approximately 1.744 lbm.

Similarly, m2=8,000/5737.0091.

Compute 5737.0091 ×1.394:

1.394 ×5737 ≈ let's compute:

1 ×5737=5737

0.3 ×5737=1721.1

0.09 ×5737=516.33

0.004 ×5737=22.95

Adding up:

5737 +1721.1=7458.1

+516.33=7974.43

+22.95=8, 7974.43+22.95≈7997.38.

Hmm, that's under 8,000. Let's try 1.394 ×5737≈7997.38. The difference is 8,000-7997.38=2.62. So 2.62 /5737 ≈0.000456. So m2≈1.394 +0.000456≈1.3945 lbm.

So m1≈1.744, m2≈1.3945. Difference is 1.744 -1.3945=0.3495 lbm, approximately 0.35 lbm.

So the closest option is F: -0.35 lbm. But wait, another option is B: -0.347 lbm. Let me check if I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute m1 and m2 more accurately.

Compute m1 = (125 * 2.5 *32)/(10.73 *534.67)

Compute numerator: 125 *2.5=312.5; 312.5 *32=10,000.

Denominator: 10.73 *534.67= let's compute precisely.

10.73 ×534.67:

Break it down:

534.67 × 10 = 5346.7

534.67 × 0.73 = ?

Compute 534.67 ×0.7 = 374.269

534.67 ×0.03=16.0401

So 374.269 +16.0401=390.3091

Total denominator:5346.7 +390.3091=5737.0091.

So m1=10,000 /5737.0091 ≈1.7446 lbm.

m2=8,000 /5737.0091 ≈1.394 lbm.

So difference is 1.7446 -1.394=0.3506 lbm.

Which is approximately 0.35 lbm. So option F is -0.35 lbm.

But looking at the options, option B is -0.347 lbm. Hmm, perhaps my calculation is slightly off due to rounding. Let me check using more precise division.

Compute 10,000 ÷5737.0091.

Let me compute 5737.0091 ×1.744:

5737.0091 ×1 =5737.0091

×0.7=4015.90637

×0.04=229.480364

×0.004=22.9480364

Add them up:

5737.0091 +4015.90637=9752.91547

+229.480364=9982.39583

+22.9480364=10,005.3439.

That's a bit over 10,000. So 1.744 gives about 10,005.34, which is 5.34 over. So to get exactly 10,000, perhaps 1.744 - (5.34/(5737.0091)).

Wait, that's complicated. Alternatively, perhaps 1.744 is a bit high, so maybe m1 is approximately 1.744 lbm, but the exact value is a bit less. Similarly, m2 is 1.394 lbm.

So the difference is approximately 0.35 lbm. So among the options, F is -0.35 lbm, and B is -0.347 lbm.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate m1 and m2 using more precise division.

Let me compute 10,000 ÷5737.0091.

Let me do long division:

5737.0091 ) 10,000.0000

5737.0091 goes into 10,000 once, with remainder 10,000 -5737.0091 =4262.9909.

Bring down a zero: 42629.909.

5737.0091 goes into 42629.909 how many times? 7 times: 7*5737.0091=40,159.0637. Wait, that's too much. Wait, 7*5737=40,159, which is more than 42,629.909? No, wait, 5737*7=40,159, which is less than 42,629.909. Wait, no, 5737 *7=40,159, but the current number is 42,629.909, which is larger. So 7 times.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. Maybe it's easier to compute 10,000 /5737.0091.

Using a calculator, 10,000 ÷5737.0091 ≈1.7446.

Similarly, 8,000 ÷5737.0091 ≈1.394.

So difference is about 0.3506 lbm.

Looking at the options, option F is -0.35 lbm, and option B is -0.347 lbm. Since 0.3506 is closer to 0.35 than 0.347, the answer should be F.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in units somewhere. Let me double-check.

Wait, the problem states the container's volume is 2.5 ft³, and pressure is in psia. The gas is oxygen, so molar mass is 32 lbm/mol. The gas constant R is 10.73 psi·ft³/(lbm·mol·R). So that seems correct.

Another approach: Since T is constant, the ratio of pressures is P1/P2 = 125/100 = 1.25.

The mass is proportional to pressure when V and T are constant. So m1 = 1.25 * m2.

But the mass leaked is m1 - m2 = 0.25 * m2.

Wait, no, that's not the right way. Because m1 = (P1 / P2) * m2, so m1 = 1.25 * m2.

So the mass that leaked is m1 - m2 = 0.25 m2.

But I don't know m2 yet. Alternatively, I can compute m1 and m2 as I did before.

Another thought: Maybe I should use the formula for mass change when pressure changes at constant V and T.

Since m = (P V M) / (R T), then Δm = m_initial - m_final = (P_initial - P_final) * V M / (R T).

So Δm = (125 -100) * 2.5 *32 / (10.73 *534.67)

Compute numerator:25 *2.5=62.5 *32=2000.

Denominator:10.73 *534.67=5737.0091.

So Δm=2000 /5737.0091≈0.3489 lbm.

Which is approximately 0.349 lbm, so around 0.347 lbm when rounded, which is option B.

Wait, that's different from what I got earlier. So where did I go wrong before?

Wait, this approach seems more straightforward. So let me redo this.

Δm = (P1 - P2) * V * M / (R T)

= (125 -100) *2.5 *32 / (10.73 *534.67)

=25 *2.5 *32 / (10.73 *534.67)

25 *2.5 =62.5; 62.5 *32=2000.

Denominator:10.73 *534.67≈5737.0091.

So Δm=2000 /5737.0091≈0.3489 lbm.

Which rounds to approximately 0.349 lbm, which is about 0.35 lbm, but let me check.

Wait, 2000 /5737.0091 is exactly:

Let me compute 5737.0091 ×0.3489 ≈2000.

Wait, 5737.0091 ×0.3489:

Well, 5737 ×0.3=1721.1

5737 ×0.04=229.48

5737 ×0.008=45.896

5737 ×0.0009≈5.1633

Adding up: 1721.1 +229.48=1950.58 +45.896=1996.476 +5.1633≈2001.64.

Hmm, that's a bit over 2000, so perhaps the exact value is a bit less than 0.3489.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach:

0.3489 ×5737.0091 ≈2000.

But regardless, the exact value is approximately 0.3489, which is about 0.349 lbm.

Looking at the options, option B is -0.347 lbm, which is very close. So perhaps my initial approach was correct, but the exact calculation using Δm gives 0.3489, which is approximately 0.349, which is about 0.35 lbm, but option B is 0.347.

Wait, perhaps I should check the precise calculation again.

Compute 2000 /5737.0091:

Let me compute this division step by step.

5737.0091 goes into 20000 (since 2000 is 2000.0) how many times?

Wait, 5737.0091 ×3 =17,211.0273. That's more than 20,000? No, wait, 5737 ×3=17,211, which is less than 20,000. Wait, no, 5737 ×3=17,211, which is less than 20,000. So 3 times.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think of 2000 ÷5737.0091.

Wait, 5737 is about 5.7 thousand. So 2000 is less than 5737, so the result is less than 1. So 2000 /5737≈0.3489.

So 0.3489 lbm is the mass leaked.

Looking at the options, option B is -0.347 lbm, which is very close. So perhaps due to more precise calculation, it's 0.347 lbm.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the denominator.

Wait, 10.73 *534.67.

Let me compute it exactly.

10.73 ×534.67:

Compute 10 ×534.67 =5346.7

0.73 ×534.67.

Compute 0.7 ×534.67 = 374.269

0.03 ×534.67=16.0401

So 374.269 +16.0401=390.3091

Total denominator=5346.7 +390.3091=5737.0091.

So denominator is correct.

So 2000 /5737.0091 = let's compute this.

Compute 5737.0091 ×0.347 = ?

0.3 ×5737.0091=1721.10273

0.04 ×5737.0091=229.480364

0.007 ×5737.0091=40.1590637

Adding these:

1721.10273 +229.480364=1950.583094

+40.1590637=1990.742158

So 0.347 ×5737.0091≈1990.742158, which is less than 2000.

The difference is 2000 -1990.742158=9.257842.

So to reach 2000, we need an additional 9.257842.

Each 0.001 of the multiplier adds 5.7370091 to the product.

So 9.257842 /5.7370091≈1.614.

So 0.347 +0.001614≈0.3486.

So 0.3486 ×5737.0091≈2000.

So the exact value is approximately 0.3486 lbm, which rounds to 0.349 lbm.

Looking at the options, option B is -0.347, which is slightly lower, and option F is -0.35, which is a bit higher. Since 0.3486 is closer to 0.35 than 0.347, perhaps the intended answer is B, but the precise calculation gives around 0.3486, which is approximately 0.349 lbm.

But looking at the options, option B is -0.347 lbm, which is very close, possibly due to rounding in intermediate steps.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider significant figures. The given values are:

Volume: 2.5 ft³ (2 significant figures)

Pressures: 125 psia and 100 psia (3 and 3 sig figs)

Temperature:75°F, which converts to 534.67 R, which is 5 significant figures.

Molar mass of O2 is 32 lbm/mol (2 sig figs)

So the least number of significant figures is 2 (from volume), so the answer should be reported to 2 sig figs.

So 0.3486 lbm would be approximately 0.35 lbm, which is 2 sig figs, so option F: -0.35 lbm.

But wait, the options have B as -0.347 and F as -0.35. Since 0.3486 is approximately 0.35 when rounded to two decimal places, but 0.347 is three decimal places.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use more precise R value or other factors.

Wait, another thought: Did I use the correct R value? R is 10.73 psi·ft³/(lbm·mol·R). Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the ideal gas law in terms of lbm and account for the units correctly.

Wait, let me try an alternative approach: Using the ideal gas law in terms of lbm.

The ideal gas law can also be written as:

P = (ρ R T) / M

Where ρ is density (lbm/ft³), R is the gas constant in appropriate units, and M is molar mass.

Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, using the combined gas law for mass.

Alternatively, since the container's volume is constant, and temperature is constant, the pressure is proportional to mass.

So m1/m2 = P1/P2

So m2 = m1 * (P2/P1)

Mass leaked = m1 - m2 = m1 - m1*(P2/P1) = m1*(1 - P2/P1)

But m1 can be calculated using P1, V, R, T, and M.

Hmm, but that brings me back to the same calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the initial and final masses precisely.

Compute m1 = (125 *2.5 *32)/(10.73 *534.67)

= (3125) *32 / (10.73 *534.67)

=10,000 /5737.0091≈1.7446 lbm.

m2= (100 *2.5 *32)/(10.73 *534.67)

=8,000 /5737.0091≈1.394 lbm.

So difference is 1.7446 -1.394=0.3506 lbm.

So approximately 0.351 lbm, which would be 0.35 lbm when rounded to three decimal places, but looking at the options, option F is -0.35 lbm, which matches.

But option B is -0.347 lbm, which is very close. So perhaps the intended answer is B, but my calculation says F.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I made a mistake in the calculation of m1 and m2.

Wait, let me compute m1 and m2 using exact division.

Compute m1 = 10,000 /5737.0091.

Using calculator steps:

5737.0091 ×1.744 = ?

1.744 ×5737.0091.

Compute 1×5737.0091 =5737.0091

0.7×5737.0091=4015.90637

0.04×5737.0091=229.480364

0.004×5737.0091=22.9480364

Adding them up:

5737.0091 +4015.90637=9752.91547

+229.480364=9982.39583

+22.9480364=10,005.34387.

So 1.744 gives about 10,005.34, which is a bit over 10,000, so the exact m1 is slightly less than 1.744 lbm.

Similarly, m2=8,000 /5737.0091=1.394 lbm.

So the difference is approximately 0.3506 lbm, which is about 0.35 lbm.

So the correct answer should be F: -0.35 lbm.

But the options include B: -0.347 lbm, which is very close. Perhaps the intended answer is B, but my calculation says F.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the mass is 0.347 lbm, but I'm not sure. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the exact value of 2000 /5737.0091.

Let me compute 5737.0091 ×0.347.

0.3 ×5737.0091=1721.10273

0.04 ×5737.0091=229.480364

0.007 ×5737.0091=40.1590637

Adding these:1721.10273 +229.480364=1950.583094 +40.1590637=1990.742158.

So 0.347 ×5737.0091=1990.742158.

The difference is 2000 -1990.742158=9.257842.

Each 0.001 increase in the multiplier adds 5.7370091 to the product.

So 9.257842 ÷5.7370091≈1.614.

So the multiplier is 0.347 +0.001614≈0.3486.

So 0.3486 ×5737.0091≈2000.

So the exact Δm is approximately 0.3486 lbm, which is 0.349 lbm when rounded to three decimal places.

Looking at the options, option B is -0.347, which is very close but slightly lower. Option F is -0.35, which is slightly higher.

Since 0.3486 is closer to 0.35 than 0.347, I think the intended answer is F: -0.35 lbm.

To determine the mass of oxygen that leaked out of the container, we use the ideal gas law under the assumption of constant volume and temperature. The relationship between pressure and mass for an ideal gas is linear, allowing us to calculate the initial and final masses of oxygen and find the difference.

### Key Steps:
1. **Convert Temperature**: Convert 75°F to Rankine:  
   \[
   T = 75 + 459.67 = 534.67 \, \text{R}
   \]

2. **Ideal Gas Law**:  
   Using \( PV = nRT \), where \( n \) is the number of moles, and \( m = nM \) (with \( M = 32 \, \text{lbm/mol} \)), the mass can be expressed as:  
   \[
   m = \frac{PV \cdot M}{RT}
   \]

3. **Calculate Initial Mass (\( m_1 \))**:  
   \[
   m_1 = \frac{125 \cdot 2.5 \cdot 32}{10.73 \cdot 534.67} \approx 1.745 \, \text{lbm}
   \]

4. **Calculate Final Mass (\( m_2 \))**:  
   \[
   m_2 = \frac{100 \cdot 2.5 \cdot 32}{10.73 \cdot 534.67} \approx 1.394 \, \text{lbm}
   \]

5. **Mass Leaked**:  
   \[
   \Delta m = m_1 - m_2 = 1.745 - 1.394 = 0.351 \, \text{lbm}
   \]

6. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated mass leaked (\( 0.351 \, \text{lbm} \)) aligns closely with option **F (-0.35 lbm)**, considering rounding and significant figures.

### Conclusion:
The mass of oxygen that leaked out of the container is approximately **0.35 lbm**.

**Answer:** F
