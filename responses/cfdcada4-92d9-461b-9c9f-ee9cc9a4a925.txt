Okay, so I've got this question about contract law, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about an agreement between a widget manufacturer and a widget retailer. The agreement says that the manufacturer will sell and the retailer will buy 10,000 widgets at $50 per 100. That means each widget is $0.50, right? Because $50 for 100 widgets is 50 cents each. 

Then, it says that one thousand widgets are to be delivered by the manufacturer on the first day of each of the next 10 months. So that's 1,000 widgets each month for 10 months, totaling 10,000. The key part is the next sentence: "EACH MONTHLY DELIVERY IS A SEPARATE CONTRACT." 

The question is asking how this agreement would be interpreted. The options are from A to J, each representing a different type of contract.

Let me think about each option. 

Option A: Bilateral contract. That's a contract where both parties make a promise. In this case, the manufacturer promises to sell and the retailer to buy, so yes, it's bilateral. But the question is about the nature of the agreement as a whole or as separate contracts. So maybe A is correct, but I'm not sure yet because the question is more about the structure of the agreement.

Option B: Periodic contract. That's a contract that continues for a certain period, maybe renewing automatically. But in this case, each delivery is a separate contract, so it's not a single periodic contract that's ongoing. So B might not be the best fit.

Option C: 10 separate contracts. The agreement says each monthly delivery is a separate contract. So each 1,000 widgets is its own contract. That seems to fit. So C is a possibility.

Option D: Contract of adhesion. That's a contract where one party has all the terms, and the other party has no choice but to accept. Here, it doesn't seem like a standard form contract; both parties are making a commitment. So D is probably not correct.

Option E: Conditional contract. That would mean the contract is contingent on some condition happening. The question doesn't mention any conditions, just that each delivery is a separate contract. So E is unlikely.

Option F: Requirements-output contract. This is where one party agrees to buy all they need (requirements) and the other agrees to supply a minimum or maximum (output). The problem here is that the agreement is for a fixed number of widgets each month, so it's not based on the retailer's requirements. So F doesn't fit.

Option G: Divisible contract. A divisible contract can be split into parts where each part can be treated separately. But in a divisible contract, the entire agreement is one contract, just that it's divided into parts. Here, the agreement is stated to be separate contracts for each delivery, so it's not just divisible but multiple separate contracts. So G might not be the right choice.

Option H: Unilateral contract. That's where only one party makes a promise. Here, both are making mutual promises, so it's bilateral, not unilateral. H is out.

Option I: Void contract. A void contract is illegal or impossible. There's nothing here suggesting that; the agreement seems valid. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Installment contract. An installment contract is one where payment is made in installments, but the goods are delivered in a single delivery. Or sometimes it's used when payment is over time, but the delivery is one shipment. In this case, it's multiple shipments. Wait, no, actually, an installment contract is when the goods are delivered in parts, each part being a separate installment, but the contract is one overall. For example, buying a car with monthly payments and the car is delivered in parts. But in our case, each delivery is a separate contract, so it's not just one installment contract but 10 separate ones. So J might not be the right answer because each delivery is a separate contract, not installments under one contract.

Wait, but sometimes installment contracts are considered divisible contracts. But the key here is that the agreement states each delivery is a separate contract, so it's not just one contract with multiple installments but 10 separate agreements.

So putting it all together, the agreement is structured as 10 separate contracts, each for 1,000 widgets. Therefore, the correct answer should be C: 10 separate contracts.
</think>

The agreement specifies that each monthly delivery is a separate contract, meaning each of the 10 monthly shipments constitutes its own independent agreement. This aligns with the interpretation of 10 separate contracts.
