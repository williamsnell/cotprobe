The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A woman broke her leg while skiing. She was taken to a hospital where she was treated by a doctor who determined that the woman would need surgery to set the broken bones so that they would heal properly. During the surgery, the doctor inserted several metal screws into the woman's leg to hold the bones together. Although the hospital charged the woman a substantial fee for the doctor's services, the bill did not include a separate charge for the cost of the bone screws. A few months after the surgery, the woman's leg still was not fully healed. The doctor eventually concluded that the screws that were inserted into the woman's leg had been defective. The woman was forced to have a second surgery to replace the defective screws. If the woman asserts a strict tort liability claim against the doctor and the hospital for using defective screws in her surgery, she will most likely

Options:

A: not prevail, because the doctor and the hospital can argue that the defect was not apparent during the surgery.
B: prevail, because the doctor and the hospital provided a product to her that was defective and unreasonably dangerous.
C: prevail, because the doctor and the hospital failed to provide a follow-up check on the screws used.
D: prevail, because the hospital and the doctor were negligent in their duty to ensure the safety of medical devices used.
E: not prevail, because the doctor and the hospital did not manufacture the screws and, therefore, the defect in the screws was not their fault.
F: not prevail, because the doctor and the hospital will be treated as service providers rather than product sellers.
G: not prevail, because the hospital did not separately charge for the screws, thus they cannot be held responsible.
H: prevail, because the doctor and the hospital did not inform her about the potential risks of defective screws.
I: not prevail, because the doctor and the hospital are not liable for defects in medical devices they did not manufacture.
J: prevail, because the doctor and the hospital probably would have realized the screws were defective if they had carefully examined them.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this tort law question. The woman had a skiing accident, broke her leg, needed surgery. The doctor used metal screws, but they were defective. Now she's suing under strict tort liability. Hmm, strict liability usually applies when a product is defective and causes injury. 

I remember that in strict liability, the seller or manufacturer can be liable even if they were not negligent. But wait, in this case, the doctor and hospital aren't the manufacturers. They're using a product (the screws) that turned out to be defective. So, can they be held strictly liable? 

I think about whether the hospital and doctor are considered 'vendors' of the product. If they're using the product as part of their services, maybe they aren't the traditional sellers. But in some cases, like if they provide a medical service that includes products, they might be seen as part of the chain. 

Option E says they won't prevail because the hospital and doctor didn't make the screws, so it's not their fault. That makes sense because usually, strict liability targets the manufacturer or seller. But wait, are there exceptions? Like if the hospital is a "learned intermediary" and the doctor is prescribing or using the product, maybe they have some liability. Or if they supplied the product as part of their services. 

Option F says they won't prevail because treated as service providers. That might be the case. If the hospital is providing a service (surgery) and the screw is just a tool used in that service, then maybe they're not considered product sellers. So strict liability wouldn't apply because it's not their product. 

Option B says she'll prevail because the product was defective. But that's from the manufacturer's side. The hospital and doctor aren't the ones who made the screw, so maybe they can't be held strictly liable. 

Option I says she won't prevail because they didn't make the screws, which aligns with what I was thinking. So E and I are similar, but E is about fault, while I is about liability for not manufacturing. 

Wait, wait. I think in some jurisdictions, hospitals and doctors can be held strictly liable if they supplied the defective product in the course of their business. Like, if they sold the product as part of their services, even if they didn't make it. So if the hospital charged for the screws, would that make them a seller? But in the question, the bill didn't include a separate charge for the screws. So maybe they aren't seen as selling the product. 

If the hospital didn't charge separately, does that mean they aren't a seller? Then, under strict liability, the woman would need to sue the manufacturer. But she's suing the hospital and doctor. So maybe the answer is E or I. 

Wait, I think the key is whether the hospital and doctor are part of the chain of distribution. If they're using the product in their practice, but not selling it, then they might not be strictly liable. So E says she won't prevail because they didn't make the screws, which is correct. Or I says the same thing but phrased differently. 

Wait, looking at the options again. E is about fault, I is about liability. The question is about strict liability, which doesn't require proving fault. So if the hospital and doctor aren't the ones who made the product, they can't be held strictly liable. So I think the correct answer is E or I. 

Wait, but some cases might hold hospitals liable if they supplied the product as part of their services. For example, if the hospital provides the screws as part of the surgery, they might be considered the 'vendors' for the purpose of strict liability. But in this case, the hospital didn't charge separately, so maybe they aren't. 

I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. In strict liability, the key is whether the defendant is a seller or manufacturer. If the hospital is just using the product in their services, not selling it, then they aren't liable. So the answer would be E or I. 

Looking at the options, E says "because the defect was not their fault." I says "because they didn't manufacture." So I think I is more accurate. The reason is that they're not the manufacturers or sellers, so strict liability doesn't apply. 

Wait, but the question is about the woman asserting against the doctor and hospital. So if the hospital is the one that provided the screws, perhaps they are seen as a seller in this context. Or maybe not, since they didn't charge for them. 

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should recall that in strict products liability, the defendant must be in the chain of distribution. If the hospital is not a seller but just used the product, then they aren't liable. So the woman can't sue them under strict liability because they didn't make or sell the product. So the answer is I: not prevail because they didn't manufacture. 

But wait, in some cases, like if the hospital is a 'learned intermediary,' they can be liable if they failed to warn. But the question is about strict liability, not failure to warn. So I think the answer is I.

The woman is asserting a strict tort liability claim against the doctor and hospital for using defective screws. Strict liability typically applies to those in the chain of distribution, such as manufacturers or sellers. In this case, the doctor and hospital did not manufacture the screws and were not charged separately for them, making it unlikely they are considered sellers. Therefore, they are not liable under strict liability. 

Answer: I
