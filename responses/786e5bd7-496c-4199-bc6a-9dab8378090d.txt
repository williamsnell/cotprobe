Okay, let's see. I'm trying to figure out how many end tables the furniture manufacturer produced in a week. So, the problem gives me different groups of employees and how many tables each produced. I think I need to calculate the total by multiplying the number of employees in each group by the number of tables each made, then add all those together.

Alright, let's break it down step by step. First group: 8 employees each made 16 tables. So, 8 times 16. Let me do that multiplication. 8 times 16 is 128. Okay, so that's 128 tables from the first group.

Next group: 21 employees each made 23 tables. Hmm, 21 times 23. I remember that 20 times 23 is 460, and then add another 23 because it's 21. So 460 plus 23 is 483. So that's 483 tables from the second group.

Third group: 7 employees each made 27 tables. So, 7 times 27. Let me calculate that. 7 times 20 is 140, and 7 times 7 is 49. Adding those together, 140 plus 49 equals 189. So, 189 tables from the third group.

Last group: 4 employees each made 29 tables. So, 4 times 29. Let me see, 4 times 30 is 120, but since it's 29, subtract 4, so 120 minus 4 is 116. So that's 116 tables from the last group.

Now, I need to add all these totals together: 128 (from first group) + 483 (second) + 189 (third) + 116 (last). Let's add them step by step.

First, 128 plus 483. Let's see, 128 + 400 is 528, then +83 is 611. So that's 611 so far.

Next, add 189 to 611. 611 + 100 is 711, +80 is 791, +9 is 800. So now we're at 800.

Then, add the last group's 116 to 800. 800 + 100 is 900, +16 is 916.

Wait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 128 + 483 is 611. Then 611 + 189: 611 + 189. Let's add 600 + 100 = 700, then 11 +89=100. So 700 +100=800. Then 800 +116=916. Yep, that's correct.

So the total number of end tables produced is 916. Looking at the options, option A is 916. So the answer should be A.

The total number of end tables produced is calculated by summing the products of each group's employees and their production. The calculation results in 916 end tables, corresponding to option A.

Answer: A
