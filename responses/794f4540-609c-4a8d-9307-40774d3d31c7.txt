Okay, so I've got this question about what controls the process of molting in crustaceans. Hmm, I remember that molting is when an animal sheds its exoskeleton to grow. Crustaceans like crabs and lobsters do this, right?

The options are A to J. Let me think about each one. Option A says water temperature alone without hormones. I don't think temperature is the only factor because other things like hormones probably play a role too. So maybe A isn't the right answer.

Option B is the age of the crustacean. Well, age might be a factor, but I'm not sure if it's the main controller. I think molting is more triggered by physical changes rather than just age.

Option C is environmental factors. That's a broad categoryâ€”could include temperature, salinity, etc. But I'm not sure if it's just the environment or if there's a more specific factor like hormones involved.

Option D is social interactions. I don't recall molting being influenced by other crustaceans. Maybe in some cases, but I don't think that's the primary control.

Option E is diet. Diet affects growth, but molting is more about shedding the exoskeleton, which is more about the timing of growth phases rather than what they eat. So probably not E.

Option F is salinity levels. Salinity can affect many marine animals, but I'm not certain if it directly controls molting. It might influence growth rate, but maybe not the molting process itself.

Option G is the lunar cycle affecting tides. I remember hearing that some species are influenced by tidal patterns, but again, I'm not sure if that's the main controller for molting.

Option H is a hormone released from nerve cells. Oh, wait, I think crustaceans release a hormone called ecdysterone or something similar when they're ready to molt. I remember that the hormone triggers the molting process. So H seems likely.

Option I is the presence of predators. Predators might influence behavior or stress, but I don't think they directly control molting. Maybe stress could, but I'm not sure.

Option J is physical growth. Well, as they grow, their exoskeleton restricts them, so they molt. But does that mean physical growth is the controller, or is it more about the hormonal trigger when growth is needed?

Wait, molting is triggered by the release of a hormone called molt-inhibiting hormone or something similar. I think the hormones control the timing. So the process is initiated by these hormones, which are probably produced by nerve cells. So H would be the correct answer because it's the hormonal release that controls molting, not just the physical growth or other factors.

The process of molting in crustaceans is primarily controlled by a hormone released from nerve cells, which triggers the shedding of the exoskeleton to facilitate growth. 

Answer: H
