Question:

Consider a group of 10 people {A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J} and we are to choose a committee of 4 people from them. Given that (1) A and B should not be chosen together, and that (2) A, C, F should not be chosen together, then how many ways are there to choose such a committee?

Options:

A: 184
B: 200
C: 220
D: 150
E: 135
F: 176
G: 210
H: 190
I: 126
J: 165

Okay, so I've got this combinatorics problem here, and I need to figure out the number of ways to form a committee of 4 people from a group of 10. The constraints are that A and B shouldn't be chosen together, and also, A, C, and F shouldn't all be chosen together. Hmm, this seems a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with combinations, the basic approach is to calculate the total number of possible committees without any restrictions and then subtract the ones that violate the given conditions. But since there are two separate constraints here, I need to be careful about how they interact.

Let me start by calculating the total number of ways to choose 4 people out of 10 without any restrictions. That's straightforward using the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!). So, C(10,4) = 210. That's the total number of possible committees.

Now, the first constraint is that A and B shouldn't be chosen together. So, I need to subtract all the committees that include both A and B. Let me figure out how many such committees there are. If both A and B are in the committee, then we've already chosen 2 people, leaving 2 more to choose from the remaining 8 people (since we exclude A and B). Wait, no, actually, the remaining people would be 10 - 2 = 8, but since A and B are already chosen, the other two must come from the rest. So the number of committees with both A and B is C(8,2). Let me compute that: 8 choose 2 is (8*7)/(2*1) = 28. So, 28 committees include both A and B, which we need to exclude.

But wait, there's a second constraint: A, C, and F shouldn't all be chosen together. So, I also need to subtract the committees that include A, C, and F. Let me calculate how many such committees there are. If A, C, and F are all included, that's 3 people, so we need to choose 1 more from the remaining 7 people (since 10 - 3 =7). So that's C(7,1) =7. So, 7 committees include A, C, and F.

But wait, I think I might be double-counting here. Because some committees might include both A and B, and also include A, C, and F. So, I need to consider the overlap between these two constraints.

So, the committees that include both A and B and also include A, C, and F. Let me think about this. If a committee includes A, B, and then also C and F, that's 4 people: A, B, C, F. So, how many such committees are there? Well, it's exactly 1 committee: choosing all four of them. Wait, no, because the committee is 4 people, so if we have A, B, C, and F, that's exactly one specific committee. So, the number of committees that violate both constraints is 1.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's clarify. The overlap would be committees that have both A and B, and also have A, C, and F. So, the committee must include A, B, C, and F. That's exactly one committee: {A, B, C, F}. So, the number of committees that are being subtracted twice is 1.

So, applying the inclusion-exclusion principle, the total number of invalid committees is (number with A and B) + (number with A, C, F) - (number with both A and B and A, C, F).

So, that's 28 (A and B) +7 (A, C, F) -1 (both) = 34.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. The inclusion-exclusion formula is |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|. So, the total number of invalid committees is 28 +7 -1 =34.

Therefore, the total valid committees would be total committees minus invalid ones: 210 -34=176.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing any other overlaps. Are there any other committees that might be counted twice? For example, if a committee includes A, B, and C but not F, does that affect anything? No, because the second constraint is only about A, C, F all being present. So, the only overlap is when all three are present along with A and B.

So, yes, the calculation seems correct. Therefore, the total valid committees are 210 -34=176.

Looking at the options, the answer should be option F:176.

The number of valid committees is calculated by subtracting the invalid ones (those including both A and B, or A, C, F) from the total. Using inclusion-exclusion, the invalid committees are 28 +7 -1=34. Thus, 210-34=176.
