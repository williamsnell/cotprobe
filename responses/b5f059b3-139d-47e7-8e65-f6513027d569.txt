Okay, so I have this question about avoidance-avoidance conflict and the two types of behavior that can result from it. I need to pick the correct option from A to J. Let me think through this.

First, what is an avoidance-avoidance conflict? From what I remember, this is a psychological concept where a person is motivated to avoid two or more negative situations, but avoiding one leads to having to face another. So, the person is stuck because both options are things they want to avoid.

Now, the question is asking about the two types of behavior that result from this conflict. I think the key here is to recall what behaviors typically come from such a situation. I remember that in avoidance-avoidance conflicts, people often experience a lot of internal struggle because they're trying to avoid both options but can't.

One possible behavior is indecision. When someone is trying to avoid both negative outcomes, they might find it hard to make a decision because neither option is appealing. They might stall or procrastinate, trying to avoid the inevitable.

Another behavior could be escalation. I think this happens when the person keeps trying to avoid the situation, leading to more and more efforts to escape, but it escalates because the situation doesn't go away. So, the avoidance might become more intense or extreme over time.

Looking at the options, option A says "Indecision and escalation." That fits with what I was thinking. Indecision is the inability to choose, and escalation is the increasing efforts to avoid, which might make the situation worse.

Let me check the other options to be sure. Option B mentions aggression and passive resistance. I'm not sure if those are the main behaviors here. Aggression might come from other types of conflicts, like approach-avoidance, but I'm not certain. Passive resistance doesn't seem directly related to avoidance-avoidance.

Option C is procrastination and denial. Procrastination is a form of avoidance, but denial is more about refusing to accept reality, which might be part of it, but I'm not sure if both are the main behaviors.

Option D talks about displacement and rationalization. Displacement is redirecting emotions, and rationalization is justifying actions. Those seem more like coping mechanisms rather than the direct behaviors from the conflict.

Option E is overcompensation and withdrawal. Overcompensation might be trying too hard to avoid, and withdrawal is stepping back, but again, I'm not sure if these are the primary behaviors.

Option F is negotiation and compromise. That seems more like strategies used in problem-solving rather than behaviors resulting from the conflict itself.

Option G is acceptance and engagement. These seem positive, but avoidance-avoidance is more about not wanting to engage with either option, so this might not fit.

Option H mentions vacillation and attempting to leave the field. Vacillation is indecision, which aligns, but "attempting to leave the field" isn't a term I'm familiar with in this context. Maybe it refers to withdrawal, but I'm not sure.

Option I is submission and avoidance. Submission is giving in, which might happen, but avoidance is the main issue, so not sure if both are the key behaviors.

Option J talks about confrontation and resolution. Confrontation is facing the issue, which might be a resolution, but avoidance-avoidance is about avoiding, so this doesn't seem right.

So, after going through each option, option A: Indecision and escalation seems to best capture the two behaviors from an avoidance-avoidance conflict. Indecision because the person can't decide which negative outcome to face, and escalation as the avoidance becomes more intense.

The two types of behavior resulting from an avoidance-avoidance conflict are indecision and escalation. Indecision occurs because the individual struggles to choose between two negative options, while escalation refers to the increasing efforts to avoid the situation, which can make it worse.
