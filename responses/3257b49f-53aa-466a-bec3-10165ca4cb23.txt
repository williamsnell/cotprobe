Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about Richardson-Self's argument on sexist speech. The question is asking what Richardson-Self argues about whether sexist speech can be considered hate speech, and I have to choose from options A to J.

First, I need to recall what I know about this topic. I remember that hate speech is a term that usually refers to speech that targets a person or group based on certain characteristics like race, religion, gender, etc., and can include threats or attacks. But the exact parameters of what constitutes hate speech can vary.

Richardson-Self is the author of a book called "Hate Speech and Pornography," if I'm not mistaken. From what I remember, she argues that hate speech isn't just about the content being offensive but also about the context in which it's used. So, she might believe that not all instances of sexist speech are hate speech because it depends on the situation.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it can never be considered hate speech regardless of context. That seems too absolute. I think Richardson-Self allows for some contexts where it could be hate speech.

Option B claims it's never hate speech because it's free expression. That doesn't sound right because she probably acknowledges that some expressions can be harmful enough to be considered hate speech.

Option C says it's always hate speech because it doesn't involve violence. Wait, but not all hate speech involves violence. Actually, hate speech is about inciting hatred, not necessarily violence. So maybe she doesn't think it's always hate speech.

Option D states it's not always hate speech because it doesn't involve violence. Hmm, this seems similar to C but phrased differently. Wait, maybe she argues that since it doesn't involve violence, it's not necessarily hate speech. But I'm a bit confused here.

Option E says it's always hate speech because it involves violence. I don't think that's correct because hate speech can be verbal without physical violence.

Option F claims it's not hate speech because of free speech protection. But in many places, hate speech isn't protected, so this might not be accurate.

Option G says it's always hate speech because it promotes inequality. Maybe, but Richardson-Self might not take such a broad view.

Option H suggests it's only hate speech when it incites violence. That makes sense because I think some definitions of hate speech require it to incite imminent violence, but I'm not sure if Richardson-Self aligns with that.

Option I says it's hate speech when it promotes discrimination. That sounds plausible because promoting discrimination could be a component of hate speech.

Option J claims it's not always hate speech because it always involves violence. Wait, that doesn't make sense because as I thought earlier, hate speech doesn't always involve violence.

Wait, going back to the options, I think I might have mixed up some. Let me re-express them:

The question is about what Richardson-Self argues about sexist speech. From what I recall, she argues that hate speech must involve a call to violence or something similar. So, she might say that sexist speech isn't always hate speech because it doesn't necessarily involve violence.

Looking at the options again, option H says it's only hate speech when it directly incites violence. That aligns with the idea that without incitement to violence, it's not hate speech.

Alternatively, option I says it's considered hate speech when it promotes discrimination. That seems more about the content rather than the context.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Richardson-Self, in her work, differentiates between hate speech and other forms of offensive speech. She might argue that hate speech is a subset of sexist speech that includes a call to violence or action against a group.

So, if a sexist statement doesn't incite violence, it might not be hate speech. So, the correct answer would be H: Is only hate speech when it directly incites violence.

But wait, let me check the options again. Option H is "Is only hate speech when it directly incites violence." That seems to fit, because she might require that element for it to be hate speech.

Alternatively, option I is about promoting discrimination, which is a broader category. So, perhaps she includes promoting discrimination as part of hate speech, making I correct.

Wait, no. I think the key is that she requires the speech to incite violence or imminent harm. So, without that, it's not hate speech.

So, putting it all together, the answer should be H: Is only hate speech when it directly incites violence.

Richardson-Self argues that hate speech must involve a direct incitement to violence or imminent harm, distinguishing it from other forms of offensive speech. Therefore, sexist speech is only considered hate speech when it directly incites violence.
