Question:

Proteins were shown to move about in a plane of the plasma membrane when mouse cellsurface proteins and human cell-surface proteins were observed to integrate along a fused mouse-human cell plasma membrane. Which of the following cell culture techniques was most likely employed in order to yield these results?

Options:

A: Inserting a bacterial plasmid into a mammalian cell
B: Producing a hybrid cell
C: Injecting a fluorescent marker into the cell membrane
D: Producing a heterokaryon
E: Isolating an immortal variant cell from culture and using it to create a cell line
F: Inserting a tumor-inducing virus into a normal cell to initiate transformation
G: Using a method called cell fusion to combine the mouse and human cells
H: Using a technique called transfection to insert new genes
I: Using a process called somatic cell nuclear transfer
J: Inducing pluripotency in somatic cells to create stem cells

Okay, so I've got this biology question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's break it down step by step.

The question is about proteins moving in the plane of the plasma membrane when mouse and human cell surface proteins integrate after fusing the cells. So, it's talking about some kind of cell fusion experiment, I think. The result is that the proteins are moving in the membrane, which probably relates to the idea that when cells fuse, their membranes combine, allowing their proteins to mix and move together.

Looking at the options, I need to pick the technique that would allow mouse and human cells to fuse so that their cell surfaces integrate. Let's go through each option.

Option A: Inserting a bacterial plasmid into a mammalian cell. That sounds like it's about genetic engineering, maybe using a plasmid to introduce a gene. But the question is about cell fusion, not gene insertion, so probably not A.

Option B: Producing a hybrid cell. Hybrid cells are the result of cell fusion, right? So this might be the answer, but let me see the other options.

Option C: Injecting a fluorescent marker into the cell membrane. Fluorescent markers are used to track things, like in GFP experiments. But the question is about the movement of proteins after fusion, so maybe not directly related to the technique used to create the fused cells.

Option D: Producing a heterokaryon. Heterokaryons are cells with nuclei from different sources, usually in fungi. But the question is about the plasma membrane proteins, not the nuclei. So probably not D.

Option E: Isolating an immortal variant cell from culture and using it to create a cell line. That's about cell culture techniques to get continuous cell lines, but not about fusing cells. So E is probably not it.

Option F: Inserting a tumor-inducing virus into a normal cell. That's about transformation, making cells cancerous, not about fusing two different cells. So F is out.

Option G: Using a method called cell fusion to combine the mouse and human cells. Oh, cell fusion is exactly what I was thinking earlier. This technique would bring together two different cells, like mouse and human, and their membranes would merge, allowing the proteins to integrate and move together. That seems to fit the description.

Option H: Using transfection to insert new genes. Transfection is another method for introducing genetic material into cells. But the question is about cell surface proteins integrating after fusion, so this isn't about gene insertion but about physical cell merging.

Option I: Using somatic cell nuclear transfer. That's a cloning technique where you take a nucleus from one cell and put it into another. The question is about fusing entire cells, not just nuclei, so I don't think this is right.

Option J: Inducing pluripotency to create stem cells. That's about reprogramming cells, not fusing them. So J is not the answer.

So, putting it all together, the question is about observing proteins moving in the fused plasma membrane, which implies that the cells were fused together. The technique that does that is cell fusion, which is option G. The other options don't involve fusing cells; they're about other cellular processes or genetic modifications.

The question involves observing proteins moving in the plasma membrane after mouse and human cell surface proteins integrate following cell fusion. The technique that allows this is cell fusion, where two cells are combined to merge their membranes. Among the options, G is the correct answer as it directly refers to this method.

Answer: G
