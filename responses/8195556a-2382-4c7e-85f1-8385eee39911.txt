Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the input impedance of a 50 ohm transmission line that's terminated with a +j50 ohm load. The question says the line length is such that beta times length (βL) is π radians. Hmm, I remember that beta is the phase constant, and it's related to the wavelength of the signal on the line. 

Wait, the input impedance of a transmission line depends on the load impedance, the characteristic impedance of the line, and the phase shift along the line. I think the formula involves the load impedance multiplied by some exponential term involving beta and the length. Oh right, the general formula is Zin = ZL * ( (Z0 + jZL tan(βL)) / (Z0 - jZL tan(βL)) ) ). But wait, maybe I should think in terms of reflection and transmission coefficients.

Alternatively, I remember that for a transmission line, when the load is a pure reactance, the input impedance can be calculated using the formula Zin = Z0 * ( (ZL + jZ0 tan(βL)) / (Z0 + jZL tan(βL)) ). Or is it the other way around? Sometimes I get confused with the signs.

Wait, let me get this straight. The characteristic impedance Z0 is 50 ohms, and the load ZL is +j50 ohms, which is a purely reactive load (capacitive since it's positive j). The line length is such that βL = π. So β is 2π/λ, so if βL is π, that's half a wavelength, right? Because a full wavelength would be 2π. So if L is half a wavelength, what does that imply?

I think when the line length is an odd multiple of half-wavelengths, the input impedance becomes equal to the load impedance. Wait, no. Let me think about the standing wave conditions. At a distance L from the load, the input impedance is given by Zin = (Z0² + ZL e^{jβL}) ) / (Z0 - ZL e^{jβL} ) ), but wait, that's probably not the right formula. I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, another approach: the input impedance can be found using the formula Zin = Z0 * ( (ZL + jZ0 tan(βL)) ) / (Z0 + jZL tan(βL)) ). Let me plug in the numbers. Z0 is 50 ohms, ZL is j50 ohms, and βL is π radians. 

Wait, what's tan(π)? Oh right, tan(π) is zero because tan(theta) is sin(theta)/cos(theta), and at pi radians, sin(pi) is zero. So tan(pi) = 0. So substituting into the formula, Zin becomes Z0 * (ZL + 0) / (Z0 + 0) ) = Z0 * (ZL / Z0) ) = ZL. So Zin would be ZL, which is j50 ohms. Wait, but looking at the options, H is +50j ohms. So that would be the answer. 

Wait, but wait another moment. Could the formula be different? I'm a bit unsure because when beta*L is pi, which is half a wavelength, sometimes the input impedance equals the load impedance. But wait, when beta*L is pi, the line acts as a transformer. Oh wait, when L is a quarter wavelength, the input impedance is the reciprocal of the load impedance. But for half a wavelength, the input impedance is the same as the load. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, let's consider a transmission line with length L. The input impedance Zin is given by Zin = ZL * e^{jβL} / (Z0 + ZL * e^{jβL} / Z0 ). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the input impedance can be found using the formula Zin = (Z0 + ZL e^{jβL}) / (1 + (ZL/Z0) e^{jβL}) ) multiplied by Z0? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think of it in terms of characteristic impedance and phase shift.

Another approach: The input impedance of a transmission line with a load ZL at a distance L from the source is given by Zin = Z0 * ( (ZL + jZ0 tan(βL)) ) / (Z0 + jZL tan(βL)) ). Since βL is π, tan(π) is zero. So substituting, Zin = Z0 * (ZL) / Z0 = ZL. So Zin would be j50 ohms, which is option H. 

Wait, but another perspective: if the line is a half wavelength long, then the input impedance equals the load impedance. Because a half wavelength acts like a transformer that doesn't change the impedance. So if the load is j50, then the input impedance is j50, which is option H. 

So the correct answer should be H: +50j ohms.
</think>

The input impedance of a 50 ohm transmission line terminated with a load of +j50 ohms, where the line length is such that βL = π radians, can be determined using the formula:

\[
Z_{\text{in}} = Z_0 \cdot \frac{Z_L + jZ_0 \tan(\beta L)}{Z_0 + jZ_L \tan(\beta L)}
\]

Here, \( Z_0 = 50 \, \Omega \), \( Z_L = j50 \, \Omega \), and \( \beta L = \pi \). Since \( \tan(\pi) = 0 \), the formula simplifies to:

\[
Z_{\text{in}} = Z_0 \cdot \frac{Z_L}{Z_0} = Z_L
\]

Thus, the input impedance equals the load impedance, which is \( +j50 \, \Omega \). This corresponds to option H.
