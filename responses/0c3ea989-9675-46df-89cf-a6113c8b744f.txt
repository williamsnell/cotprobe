Okay, so I have this problem about a linear transformation f from the plane to the real numbers. I'm given two specific values: f(1,1) equals 1 and f(-1,0) equals 2. I need to find f(3,5) and choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, linear transformations from the plane (which is R²) to the real numbers (R) are essentially linear functionals. So, f can be represented as a dot product with some vector (a, b), right? Because any linear transformation from R² to R can be written as f(x, y) = a*x + b*y. So, I can think of f as f(x, y) = a*x + b*y.

Now, I have two equations based on the given information. Let me write them down.

First, f(1,1) = a*1 + b*1 = a + b = 1. That's equation one.

Second, f(-1,0) = a*(-1) + b*0 = -a + 0 = -a = 2. So that's equation two.

Wait, equation two: -a = 2. So solving for a, I get a = -2. That seems straightforward.

Now, plug a = -2 into equation one. So equation one becomes (-2) + b = 1. Solving for b: b = 1 + 2 = 3. So b is 3.

So now I know that f(x, y) = (-2)*x + 3*y.

Now, I need to find f(3,5). Plugging into the equation: f(3,5) = (-2)*3 + 3*5.

Let's compute that. (-2)*3 is -6, and 3*5 is 15. So adding them together: -6 +15 = 9.

Wait, that gives me 9. Looking at the options, A is 9. So the answer should be A.

Wait, did I do that correctly? Let me double-check.

Linear transformation f(x,y) = a x + b y.

Given f(1,1) = a + b =1.

f(-1,0) = -a + 0 =2 → -a=2 → a= -2.

Substitute a=-2 into a + b=1: -2 + b=1 → b=3.

So f(3,5)= (-2)*3 +3*5 = -6 +15=9.

Yes, that seems right. So the answer is A:9.

The problem involves a linear transformation \( f \) from \( \mathbb{R}^2 \) to \( \mathbb{R} \), represented as \( f(x, y) = ax + by \). Given \( f(1, 1) = 1 \) and \( f(-1, 0) = 2 \), we solve for \( a \) and \( b \):

1. \( f(1, 1) = a(1) + b(1) = a + b = 1 \)
2. \( f(-1, 0) = a(-1) + b(0) = -a = 2 \Rightarrow a = -2 \)

Substituting \( a = -2 \) into \( a + b = 1 \) gives \( b = 3 \). Thus, \( f(x, y) = -2x + 3y \). Evaluating at \( (3, 5) \):

\[
f(3, 5) = -2(3) + 3(5) = -6 + 15 = 9
\]

The answer is A: 9.
