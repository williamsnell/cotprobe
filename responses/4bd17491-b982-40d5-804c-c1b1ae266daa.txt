Okay, so I have this question about English law and custom. I'm a bit rusty on my legal terms, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking about the fundamental prerequisite for the incorporation of custom under English law. The options are A through J, each giving a different condition.

First, I remember that in common law systems, like in England, custom can play a role in law. But how exactly does it get incorporated? I think customs are usually practices that have been followed for a long time, but they don't automatically become law. There's a process or certain conditions they have to meet.

I remember something about customs needing to be "ancient" and "certain" and "peaceable." So maybe that's part of it. But the options don't mention "ancient" directly. Let me look at the options.

Option A says custom is superior to English law and always incorporated. That doesn't sound right. I think English law, including statutes, is superior, so custom can't be always incorporated just because it's old.

Option B says custom isn't incorporated under English law. That can't be right because I know customs can form part of the law, like certain property rights or village laws.

Option C mentions approval by the Queen. I don't think the Queen has to personally approve each custom. The Crown has certain roles, but this seems too direct.

Option D: Custom is incorporated if it's not in conflict with existing legislation. That makes some sense because if a custom contradicts an act of parliament, it would be struck down. So maybe custom can be used unless it's against current laws.

Option E: At least a century. I thought it's more about being "time immemorial," which is a bit more vague than a century. But maybe in practice, a long time is needed.

Option F: Ratified by a national referendum. That's more of a democratic process, but I don't think customs are incorporated that way in English law.

Option G: Universally practiced. No, I think customs can be local. For example, a custom in a particular village might be recognized even if others don't follow it.

Option H: Recognized by Parliament. I don't recall that being the case. Courts might recognize customs without needing parliamentary approval first.

Option I: Not in conflict with common law. Hmm, this is similar to D but specifically mentions common law. But I think the main issue is with legislation, not just common law.

Option J: Passed with implementing legislation. That sounds more like how statutes are made, not customs. Custom isn't something that needs legislation to be incorporated.

So, thinking about it, the key point is that custom can be part of the law unless it's against existing statutes. So the fundamental prerequisite is that it doesn't conflict with current legislation. That would be option D. But wait, I also remember that the common law itself can override custom. So maybe I should consider option I as well. But the question is about the fundamental prerequisiteâ€”probably looking for the main condition, which is not conflicting with legislation.

Wait, no. In the common law tradition, if a custom is not in conflict with statute law, it can be recognized. But if it's against the common law, which is also part of the law, then it's invalid. So maybe both D and I are correct? But the options are separate. I think the primary condition is not conflicting with existing legislation because statutes take precedence over both common law and custom.

So, going back, the answer should be D: Custom is incorporated if it is not in conflict with existing legislation.

The fundamental prerequisite for the incorporation of custom under English law is that the custom must not conflict with existing legislation. This is because statutes take precedence over both common law and custom. Therefore, the correct answer is:

D
