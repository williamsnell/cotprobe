Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find how many integers between 1 and 100 are divisible by either 2, 3, or 5. The options are given from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when a question asks about numbers divisible by any of several numbers, it's a problem involving the inclusion-exclusion principle. That's the one where you add the counts, then subtract the overlaps, and then add back in the parts where all three overlap, right?

So, the formula I think I should use is:

Number of multiples of 2 + multiples of 3 + multiples of 5 - multiples of both 2 and 3 - multiples of both 2 and 5 - multiples of both 3 and 5 + multiples of 2, 3, and 5.

Let me break it down.

First, find how many numbers between 1 and 100 are divisible by 2. That's straightforward: it's 100 divided by 2, which is 50. So 50 numbers.

Next, numbers divisible by 3: 100 divided by 3 is approximately 33.333, but since we're dealing with integers, we take the floor, which is 33.

Then, numbers divisible by 5: 100 divided by 5 is 20. So 20 numbers.

Now, I need to subtract the overlaps because those have been counted twice. The overlaps are the numbers divisible by both 2 and 3, 2 and 5, and 3 and 5.

Starting with numbers divisible by both 2 and 3, which is the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 3. LCM of 2 and 3 is 6. So, 100 divided by 6 is about 16.666, so 16 numbers.

Next, numbers divisible by both 2 and 5. LCM of 2 and 5 is 10. 100 divided by 10 is exactly 10, so 10 numbers.

Then, numbers divisible by both 3 and 5. LCM of 3 and 5 is 15. 100 divided by 15 is about 6.666, so 6 numbers.

Now, subtracting these overlaps: 50 + 33 + 20 = 103. Then subtract 16 + 10 + 6, which is 32. 103 - 32 = 71.

But wait, I think I have to add back the numbers that are divisible by all three (2, 3, and 5) because they've been subtracted too many times. The LCM of 2, 3, and 5 is 30. So, 100 divided by 30 is about 3.333, so 3 numbers.

Adding that back: 71 + 3 = 74.

So, the total number of integers divisible by 2, 3, or 5 is 74. Looking at the options, E is 74. So the answer should be E.

The correct answer is E: 74.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Count Multiples of Each Number:**
   - Multiples of 2: \( \left\lfloor \frac{100}{2} \right\rfloor = 50 \)
   - Multiples of 3: \( \left\lfloor \frac{100}{3} \right\rfloor = 33 \)
   - Multiples of 5: \( \left\lfloor \frac{100}{5} \right\rfloor = 20 \)
   - Total so far: \( 50 + 33 + 20 = 103 \)

2. **Subtract Overlaps (Multiples of Two Numbers):**
   - Multiples of 2 & 3 (LCM=6): \( \left\lfloor \frac{100}{6} \right\rfloor = 16 \)
   - Multiples of 2 & 5 (LCM=10): \( \left\lfloor \frac{100}{10} \right\rfloor = 10 \)
   - Multiples of 3 & 5 (LCM=15): \( \left\lfloor \frac{100}{15} \right\rfloor = 6 \)
   - Total overlaps to subtract: \( 16 + 10 + 6 = 32 \)
   - Adjusted total: \( 103 - 32 = 71 \)

3. **Add Back Multiples of All Three Numbers:**
   - Multiples of 2, 3, & 5 (LCM=30): \( \left\lfloor \frac{100}{30} \right\rfloor = 3 \)
   - Final total: \( 71 + 3 = 74 \)

Thus, the number of integers between 1 and 100 divisible by 2, 3, or 5 is **74**.
