Okay, so I've got this problem here about coloring the edges of a complete graph with 6 vertices using two colors, and I need to find the minimum number of monochromatic triangles that must exist. The options are from A to J, with numbers ranging from 0 to 9. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that a complete graph with 6 vertices, K6, has every pair of vertices connected by an edge. So, the total number of edges is C(6,2) which is 15. Each edge is colored either color A or color B, so two colors in total.

The question is about the minimum number of triangles (which are sets of three vertices all connected to each other) that are all the same color. I think this relates to Ramsey theory, which deals with conditions under which order must appear. Specifically, Ramsey numbers tell us the minimum number of vertices needed to guarantee a certain structure, like a monochromatic triangle.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact Ramsey number for triangles. I think R(3,3) is 6, which means that any 2-coloring of K6 will necessarily contain at least one monochromatic triangle. So, based on that, the minimum number should be at least one, right? So looking at the options, E is 1, which would be the answer. But wait, maybe there's more to it.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me think again. Ramsey's theorem says that R(m,n) is the smallest number such that any 2-coloring of K_{R(m,n)} contains a red K_m or a blue K_n. So R(3,3)=6, meaning that in any 2-coloring of K6, there must be a monochromatic triangle. So the minimum number is at least one. But could it be higher?

Wait, the question is about the least number, so the minimal number that must exist, regardless of how you color the edges. So the minimal number is one, because you can't have zero. So the answer would be E:1.

But wait, I'm recalling that in some cases, the minimal number might be higher. Like, maybe there's a way to color K6 such that you get exactly one monochromatic triangle, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing this with something else.

Wait another thought: Maybe the question is asking for the minimal number of monochromatic triangles across all possible colorings, not the minimum that must exist. But no, that's not it. The question is about the least number that you can't avoid, so the minimal number that is guaranteed to exist regardless of the coloring.

Wait, but I think the answer is actually more than one. Let me consider an example. Suppose I try to color the edges to minimize monochromatic triangles. How would that work?

Perhaps using a strategy where I balance the colors as much as possible. For example, if I partition the graph into two almost equal parts and color the edges within each part with one color and between parts with another. But wait, that might not necessarily minimize the number of monochromatic triangles.

Alternatively, maybe using a more symmetric approach. But honestly, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about the total number of triangles in K6. K6 has C(6,3)=20 triangles. Each triangle can be monochromatic in red or blue, or mixed. So the total number of monochromatic triangles would depend on how the edges are colored.

But the problem is to find the minimum number that is guaranteed, regardless of the coloring. So regardless of how you color the edges with two colors, you must have at least how many monochromatic triangles.

Wait, I found a theorem that might help. It's called Goodman's theorem, which gives a formula for the minimum number of monochromatic triangles in a two-colored complete graph. The formula is:

Number of monochromatic triangles ≥ (n(n-1)(n-5))/24 when n is even.

Wait, n is 6 here. Let me plug that in:

(6*5*(-1))/24 = (6*5*(-1)) = -30 /24 = -1.25. Hmm, that can't be right because the number can't be negative. Maybe I misapplied the formula.

Wait, maybe the formula is different. Let me check again. I think the formula is:

For a complete graph with n vertices, the minimum number of monochromatic triangles is:

If n is even: (n^3 - 5n)/24

So for n=6: (216 - 30)/24 = 186/24 = 7.75. But that's not an integer, so perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, maybe I should look up Goodman's theorem correctly. According to what I remember, Goodman's theorem states that the minimum number of monochromatic triangles in a two-coloring of K_n is:

If n is even: (n^3 - n)/24

Wait, n=6, so (216 -6)/24=210/24=8.75. Hmm, that's not possible either. Maybe I'm getting the formula wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

Number of monochromatic triangles ≥ (n choose 3) - (n choose 2) * floor(n/2) + something.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about how many triangles must be monochromatic. Let me consider that each edge is colored red or blue. For each vertex, it has degree 5, so the number of red edges and blue edges from each vertex can vary.

Wait, another approach: For each vertex, the number of red edges and blue edges from it is r and b, respectively, where r + b =5. The number of monochromatic triangles involving that vertex can be calculated using the number of red and blue edges from it.

For a given vertex, the number of red triangles it forms is C(r,2), since any two red edges from it form a red triangle if the edge between those two is also red. Similarly, the number of blue triangles is C(b,2). But this is only for triangles involving that vertex.

Wait, but to find the total number of monochromatic triangles, we need to sum over all vertices, but each triangle is counted three times, once at each vertex.

So, the total number of monochromatic triangles T is (sum over all vertices of [C(r_i,2) + C(b_i,2)]) /3.

Now, to minimize T, we need to minimize the sum of [C(r_i,2) + C(b_i,2)] for each vertex.

Since r_i + b_i =5, and for each vertex, we can choose r_i and b_i such that this sum is minimized.

C(r,2) + C(b,2) = [r(r-1) + b(b-1)] / 2.

Since b=5-r, this becomes [r(r-1) + (5-r)(4-r)] /2.

Let's compute this function for r=0 to5:

r=0: [0 +5*4]/2 =20/2=10
r=1: [0 +4*3]/2=12/2=6
r=2: [2*1 +3*2]/2=(2+6)/2=4
r=3: [3*2 +2*1]/2=(6+2)/2=4
r=4: [4*3 +1*0]/2=12/2=6
r=5: [5*4 +0]/2=20/2=10

So the minimum for each vertex is 4, achieved when r=2, b=3 or r=3, b=2.

So if each vertex has either 2 red and 3 blue edges, or 3 red and 2 blue edges, the sum per vertex is 4. Since there are 6 vertices, the total sum would be 6*4=24.

Thus, the total number of monochromatic triangles T=24/3=8.

So, according to this, the minimum number of monochromatic triangles is 8. But wait, that's for the sum of all vertices, but I'm not sure if this is achievable. Because the way the edges are colored must satisfy that each vertex has either 2 red and 3 blue edges or vice versa.

Wait, but can we arrange the edges so that each vertex has exactly 2 red and 3 blue edges, or 3 red and 2 blue? Because the total number of red edges would then be (6*2)/2=6, since each red edge is counted twice (once from each end). Similarly, blue edges would be (6*3)/2=9, but 6*3=18, divided by 2 gives 9, which is possible because 6*3=18, and 18/2=9.

Wait, but 6 vertices each with 3 blue edges would require 6*3/2=9 blue edges. Similarly, 6 vertices each with 2 red edges would require 6*2/2=6 red edges. So yes, it's possible to have such a coloring where each vertex has exactly 2 red edges and 3 blue edges.

In that case, the total sum over all vertices of [C(r_i,2) + C(b_i,2)] would be 6*4=24, leading to T=24/3=8 monochromatic triangles.

But wait, according to Ramsey's theorem, R(3,3)=6, which means that there's at least one monochromatic triangle, but according to this calculation, the minimum is actually 8. That seems contradictory, but I think I'm confusing Ramsey's theorem with the actual minimal count.

Wait, Ramsey's theorem tells us that there must be at least one monochromatic triangle, but Goodman's theorem gives a lower bound on the number. So the correct minimum is 8, as per the calculation above. So the answer would be 8, which is option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought the answer was 1 based on Ramsey's theorem, but now I'm getting 8 using this method. I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check.

Ramsey's theorem states that R(3,3)=6, meaning that any 2-coloring of K6 contains at least one monochromatic triangle. So the minimum number guaranteed is one. But Goodman's theorem actually gives a better lower bound, saying that the number is at least 8.

Wait, that can't be right because 8 is more than one. So perhaps Goodman's theorem provides a lower bound that's higher than Ramsey's, but Ramsey's is a weaker result. So in this case, the minimum number of monochromatic triangles is 8, which is higher than the lower bound of one given by Ramsey's theorem.

Wait, but I'm confused because I thought Ramsey's theorem was a specific case, and Goodman's theorem gives a more precise count. So, according to Goodman's theorem, the minimal number is 8, which is higher than the Ramsey lower bound of 1. Therefore, the correct answer should be 8, which is option A.

But wait, let me make sure. Let me look up Goodman's theorem formula again. The formula for the minimal number of monochromatic triangles in a two-colored K_n is:

If n is even, the minimal number is (n^3 - n)/24.

For n=6, that would be (216 -6)/24=210/24=8.75, which doesn't make sense because the number of triangles must be an integer. Hmm, that suggests that maybe the formula is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

The minimal number of monochromatic triangles is (n(n-2)(n-4))/24.

For n=6: (6*4*2)/24=48/24=2. That can't be right either, because we know from our earlier calculation that it's 8.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong. Let me think again. The formula I used earlier was for each vertex, the sum of C(r_i,2) + C(b_i,2), which for each vertex is minimized when r_i=2 or 3, leading to a sum of 4 per vertex, and total sum 24, leading to T=24/3=8.

So, according to that, the minimal number is 8. So the answer should be 8, which is option A.

The problem involves determining the minimum number of monochromatic triangles in a 2-coloring of the edges of a complete graph with 6 vertices (K₆). 

Using Ramsey's theorem, we know that any 2-coloring of K₆ guarantees at least one monochromatic triangle. However, Goodman's theorem provides a more precise lower bound. By analyzing the number of monochromatic triangles contributed by each vertex, we find that the minimum number of monochromatic triangles is 8.

Thus, the answer is:

A: 8
