Question:

Consider a tank used in certain hydrodynamic experiments. After one experiment the tank contains $200 \mathrm{~L}$ of a dye solution with a concentration of $1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$. To prepare for the next experiment, the tank is to be rinsed with fresh water flowing in at a rate of $2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$, the well-stirred solution flowing out at the same rate. Find the time that will elapse before the concentration of dye in the tank reaches $1 \%$ of its original value.

Options:

A:  460.5 min
B: 520 min
C: 690 min
D: 600 min
E: 385 min
F: 345 min
G: 300 min
H: 500 min
I: 550 min
J: 420 min

Okay, so I have this problem about a tank being rinsed with fresh water. Let me try to visualize it. The tank initially has 200 liters of a dye solution at a concentration of 1 gram per liter. So, the total amount of dye in the tank at the start is 200 L * 1 g/L = 200 grams.

Now, the process is that fresh water is flowing into the tank at a rate of 2 L/min, and the well-stirred solution flows out at the same rate. Since the inflow and outflow rates are equal, the volume of the solution in the tank remains constant at 200 liters throughout the process. That's good to know because it simplifies things; the volume doesn't change, so I don't have to worry about that variable changing over time.

The question is asking how much time it will take for the concentration of dye in the tank to reach 1% of its original value. The original concentration is 1 g/L, so 1% of that is 0.01 g/L. So, we need to find the time when the concentration drops to 0.01 g/L.

I remember that this is a typical mixing problem, probably modeled by a differential equation. The key idea here is that the concentration changes over time as the dye is being washed out with the solution. Since the solution is well-stirred, the concentration is uniform throughout the tank at any time.

Let me denote the amount of dye in the tank at time t as Q(t) grams. The concentration at time t is then C(t) = Q(t) / V, where V is the volume of the solution, which is 200 L. So, C(t) = Q(t)/200.

The rate of change of the amount of dye in the tank, dQ/dt, depends on the rate at which dye leaves the tank. Since the outflow rate is 2 L/min and the concentration is C(t), the amount of dye leaving per minute is 2 L/min * C(t) = 2*(Q(t)/200) = Q(t)/100 grams per minute.

So, the differential equation governing this situation is:

dQ/dt = - (Q(t)/100)

This is a first-order linear differential equation, and its solution should be of the form Q(t) = Q0 * e^(-kt), where Q0 is the initial amount of dye, and k is the rate constant.

In this case, Q0 is 200 grams. So, the equation becomes:

Q(t) = 200 * e^(-kt)

Now, I need to determine k. From the differential equation, we have:

dQ/dt = - (Q(t)/100) => k = 1/100 per minute.

So, the equation simplifies to:

Q(t) = 200 * e^(-t/100)

We want to find the time t when the concentration C(t) reaches 0.01 g/L. Since C(t) = Q(t)/200, we have:

0.01 = Q(t)/200 => Q(t) = 0.01 * 200 = 2 grams.

So, we set up the equation:

2 = 200 * e^(-t/100)

Divide both sides by 200:

2/200 = e^(-t/100)
0.01 = e^(-t/100)

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(0.01) = -t/100

I know that ln(0.01) is the same as ln(1/100) which is -ln(100). And ln(100) is 2*ln(10), approximately 2*2.302585 ≈ 4.60517.

So,

ln(0.01) ≈ -4.60517

Thus,

-4.60517 = -t/100

Multiply both sides by -100:

t ≈ 4.60517 * 100 = 460.517 minutes.

Looking at the options, option A is 460.5 minutes, which matches our calculation.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I make any mistake in the setup?

The volume is constant at 200 L because inflow and outflow rates are equal. The rate of change of Q is -Q/100, leading to the exponential decay. Calculating when Q is 2 grams, which gives t ≈ 460.5 minutes. That seems correct.

So, the answer should be option A: 460.5 min.

The problem involves a tank initially containing 200 liters of a dye solution with a concentration of 1 g/L. Fresh water flows in at 2 L/min, and the well-stirred solution flows out at the same rate. We need to find the time for the dye concentration to reach 1% of its original value.

The volume remains constant at 200 L. The differential equation governing the amount of dye, Q(t), is dQ/dt = -Q/100, leading to the solution Q(t) = 200 * e^(-t/100). Setting Q(t) = 2 grams (1% of 200 grams) gives t ≈ 460.5 minutes.
