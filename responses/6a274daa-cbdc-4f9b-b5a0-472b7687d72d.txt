Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out which ratio can form a proportion with 6 over 9. Hmm, proportions. I remember that proportions are about equivalent fractions, right? So two ratios are in proportion if they're equal when simplified. 

First, let's look at the given ratio: 6 over 9. I think I should simplify that. To simplify a fraction, I divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor. For 6 and 9, the GCD is 3. So dividing both by 3, I get 2 over 3. So 6/9 simplifies to 2/3. Got that down.

Now, I need to check each of the options to see if any of them also simplify to 2/3. If they do, then they can form a proportion with 6/9 because they're equivalent fractions.

Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: 18 over 24. Let's simplify that. Both 18 and 24 are divisible by 6. 18 divided by 6 is 3, and 24 divided by 6 is 4. So 18/24 simplifies to 3/4. Hmm, that's not the same as 2/3. So A isn't the answer.

Option B: 8 over 12. Let's simplify. Both are divisible by 4. 8 divided by 4 is 2, and 12 divided by 4 is 3. So 8/12 simplifies to 2/3. Oh, that's exactly what we're looking for. So B is a candidate. But I should check the others to make sure there isn't another correct option.

Option C: 3 over 5. That's already in simplest form since 3 and 5 don't have any common divisors besides 1. 3/5 is 0.6, whereas 2/3 is approximately 0.666..., so they're not equal. So C is out.

Option D: 24 over 27. Let's simplify. Both numbers are divisible by 3. 24 divided by 3 is 8, and 27 divided by 3 is 9. So 24/27 becomes 8/9. That's not the same as 2/3. So D isn't correct.

Option E: 15 over 20. Let's simplify. Both are divisible by 5. 15 divided by 5 is 3, and 20 divided by 5 is 4. So 15/20 is 3/4. Not 2/3, so E is not the answer.

Option F: 9 over 6. Simplify by dividing both by 3. 9/3 is 3, and 6/3 is 2. So 9/6 simplifies to 3/2. That's the reciprocal of 2/3, so it's not equal. F is out.

Option G: 2 over 6. Simplify by dividing both by 2. 2/2 is 1, and 6/2 is 3. So 2/6 is 1/3. That's not 2/3 either. So G isn't correct.

Wait, but I thought B was correct because it simplified to 2/3. So looking back, only option B (8/12) simplifies to 2/3, which is the same as 6/9. Therefore, the correct answer must be B.

But wait, let me double-check. Sometimes there might be more than one option, but in this case, only B matches. So I'm confident that B is the right choice.

The correct answer is B, as 8/12 simplifies to 2/3, which is equivalent to 6/9.

Answer: B
