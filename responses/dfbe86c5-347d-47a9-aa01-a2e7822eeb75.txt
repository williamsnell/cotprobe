Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this accounting question about stock splits and how they affect the par value. Let me break it down step by step.

The question says that Alto Co. split its common stock 5 for 1 on July 1. At the time of the split, the fair value was $100 per share. Before the split, the company had 10,000 shares issued and outstanding, each with a par value of $10.

I remember that a stock split increases the number of shares but doesn't change the total value of the shareholders' equity. So, a 5-for-1 split means each existing share is divided into 5 new shares. Let me calculate how that affects the number of shares first.

Originally, there were 10,000 shares. After a 5-for-1 split, each share becomes 5, so the total number of shares becomes 10,000 * 5 = 50,000 shares. Okay, so the number definitely increases, which might help me eliminate some options.

Now, what about the par value? Par value is the value assigned to each share as stated in the company's charter. I think when a stock splits, the par value per share decreases because each new share is worth less, but the total par value for all shares remains the same.

Before the split, the total par value was 10,000 shares * $10 = $100,000. After the split, the number of shares is 50,000. To find the new par value per share, I divide the total par value by the new number of shares. So, $100,000 divided by 50,000 shares equals $2 per share. Wait, that's not one of the options listed. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me double-check. Oh, the options don't have $2, but let me look again. The options are A-J, and I see option I is $2. So, option I says the par value was reduced to $2. But wait, the question is asking what happened to the par value after the split. So if the par value per share went from $10 to $2, that's a reduction. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.

Wait another thought: I think when you split the stock, the par value doesn't just get divided by the split ratio. Because the split affects the number of shares but not the total par value. So the total par value stays the same, so each share's par value decreases proportionally. So yes, from $10 to $2. But looking at the options, option I is $2, so that would make sense.

Wait, but another angle: maybe the question is about whether the par value changes or not. I think in reality, the par value per share does decrease because each share is now worth less in terms of par. So the par value goes from $10 to $2, which is a reduction. So the answer should be I: Was reduced to $2.

But wait, I thought sometimes companies adjust the par value after a split. Like, maybe they don't keep the par value as a fraction. But no, the par value per share does decrease when a stock splits. So the correct answer should be I.

The correct answer is I: Was reduced to $2. 

Here's the breakdown:
- Before the split, there were 10,000 shares with a par value of $10 each, totaling $100,000 in par value.
- After a 5-for-1 split, the number of shares becomes 50,000.
- The total par value remains $100,000, so the new par value per share is $100,000 รท 50,000 = $2.
- Therefore, the par value per share is reduced to $2.

Answer: I
