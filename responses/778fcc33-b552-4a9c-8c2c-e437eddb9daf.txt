Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about attachment theory based on the scenario given. Let me break it down.

The question is about Joe, who really wants to get close to Helen, but Helen seems to be put off by his advances. It also mentions that this is typical of Joe's relationships with women. So, I need to figure out which attachment style best describes Joe.

First, I should recall what attachment theory is about. From what I remember, attachment theory categorizes people into different styles based on their patterns of behavior in relationships. The main styles are secure, anxious-ambivalent, dismissive-avoidant, and disorganized, but I might be mixing up some terms.

Looking at the options provided, the possible styles are: detached lover, avoidant lover, disorganized lover, fearful-avoidant lover, secure-avoidant lover, passionate lover, dismissive-avoidant lover, secure lover, obsessive lover, and anxious-ambivalent lover.

Now, Joe is described as someone who wants to get close but is being put off. So he's trying to get close, which might indicate he's anxious about the relationship. On the other hand, Helen is being put off, which might suggest that Joe's behavior is pushing her away. 

In attachment theory, people with an insecure attachment style often exhibit certain behaviors. For example, someone with an anxious-ambivalent (or anxious) attachment style tends to worry about abandonment and may seek excessive reassurance. They might be overly clingy or desperate in their attempts to get close to a partner, which can sometimes push the partner away.

Another style is dismissive-avoidant, where people avoid intimacy and are more independent. They might not show much interest in close relationships and might seem distant. But in Joe's case, he's actively trying to get close, which doesn't quite fit the dismissive-avoidant style.

There's also the secure attachment style, where people are comfortable with intimacy and have a balanced approach to relationships. They don't tend to worry excessively or avoid closeness, so that's probably not Joe.

Looking back at the options, J is anxious-ambivalent lover, and G is dismissive-avoidant. Since Joe is trying to get close and seems desperate, that aligns more with anxiety about abandonment, which is the anxious-ambivalent style. He's eager to connect, but his approach might be seen as overbearing, causing the other person to pull back.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes people with an anxious style can also exhibit behaviors that are more obsessive or desperate, which might make someone else avoid them. So Joe's behavior is typical in his relationships, meaning his approach is consistent. This seems to fit the anxious-ambivalent or maybe even obsessive lover, but I'm not sure if 'obsessive' is a standard term in attachment theory.

Looking at the options, J is anxious-ambivalent, which is also known as preoccupied attachment. People with this style are often described as having high anxiety about relationships, fearing abandonment, and showing clingy behavior. So Joe's trying to get close despite being pushed away fits this description.

Another point: the question says Helen appears to be put off by his advances. That suggests that Joe's behavior is making it difficult for the relationship to progress normally, which is consistent with someone who is overly anxious and thus behaves in ways that might be seen as too much.

So putting it all together, Joe is likely an anxious-ambivalent lover, which is option J.

The scenario describes Joe as someone who desires closeness but whose behavior is pushing others away. This aligns with the anxious-ambivalent attachment style, where individuals are highly anxious about relationships and fear abandonment, leading to desperate behaviors that can repel potential partners. Therefore, the best answer is:

J: an anxious-ambivalent lover

Answer: J
