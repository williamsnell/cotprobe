Question:

A business owner had a feud and "bitter blood" with a former employee. One day that employee came uninvited into the owner's office brandishing a loaded shotgun, approached the owner's desk and raised the weapon. The owner, however, was secretly waiting for the opportunity. As the employee began to press on the trigger, the owner pulled a gun from her drawer and killed him. The owner admitted she felt malice toward her enemy. The authorities charged her with murder. Can she be convicted?

Options:

A: Yes, because she had a motive to kill the employee.
B: Yes, because she admitted to feeling malice towards the employee.
C: No, because the employee was trespassing.
D: No, because the owner had a reasonable fear for her life.
E: Yes, because she had been lying in wait for the victim.
F: Yes, because she used excessive force in her response.
G: No, because she acted in self-defense.
H: Yes, because she had a previous feud with the employee.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about whether the business owner can be convicted of murder. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: The owner had a feud with a former employee, and one day the employee comes into her office uninvited, brandishing a loaded shotgun. As the employee starts to pull the trigger, the owner pulls her own gun and kills him. She admitted feeling malice toward her enemy, and she's now charged with murder.

I need to think about the elements of murder and any possible defenses she might have. Murder typically requires malice aforethought, which can be express or implied. Express malice is when someone has intent to kill, while implied malice can be from committing an act with extreme recklessness or in the commission of a felony (like using a deadly weapon).

But there's also the possibility of self-defense. For self-defense to apply, the person must have a reasonable belief of imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury, and the response must be proportional. So, if the owner felt her life was in danger when the employee was pulling the trigger, could that be a defense?

In this case, the employee was brandishing a shotgun and starting to pull the trigger. That seems like a clear threat. So, the owner shot him. But she had been waiting for him, which might suggest she was looking for a confrontation. However, the immediate act of him pulling the trigger might create a situation where self-defense applies.

I'm a bit confused because she had a motive (the feud) and admitted to malice, but if she acted in self-defense, that could negate the malice. Also, being the initial aggressor usually bars the right to self-defense, unless the aggressor withdraws in good faith or the victim escalates the force beyond what's necessary.

Wait, but in this case, the employee was the one who brandished the gun first. So the owner was in her office, and the employee entered uninvited with a gun. So the employee was the initial aggressor. Therefore, the owner might have a valid self-defense claim because she was facing an immediate threat when she acted.

But some jurisdictions might consider if the defendant was the initial aggressor. If the owner had a gun in the drawer, maybe she was waiting to attack, making her the initial aggressor. But she only pulled her gun when he started pulling the trigger. So perhaps her action was a response to his lethal force.

I'm leaning towards self-defense being a valid defense here because she was reacting to an immediate threat. So, she might not be guilty of murder because she acted in self-defense.

Looking at the options:

A: Yes, because motive. But motive alone doesn't make it murder unless other elements are present.

B: Yes, because she admitted malice. But self-defense can negate malice.

C: No, because trespassing. Trespassing is a factor, but the main issue is self-defense.

D: No, because reasonable fear for her life. That sounds like self-defense.

E: Yes, because she was lying in wait. Lying in wait could imply premeditation, but if she acted when he pulled the trigger, it's more of a response.

F: Yes, excessive force. She used a gun to stop a gun, which might not be excessive.

G: No, because self-defense. This aligns with D, which is about fear.

H: Yes, because of the feud. But a feud is more about malice than self-defense.

So, the key is whether she had a reasonable fear for her life. If yes, then self-defense applies, and she can't be convicted. So the correct answer would be G: No, because she acted in self-defense.

The business owner cannot be convicted of murder because she acted in self-defense when the former employee brandished a gun and began pulling the trigger, creating an imminent threat to her life. Self-defense applies as she had a reasonable belief in the necessity of using lethal force to protect herself. 

Answer: G
