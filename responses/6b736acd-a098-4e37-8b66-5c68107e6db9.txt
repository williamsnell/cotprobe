Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about cabbages grown in a summer garden and how they're counted in GDP and NDP. Hmm, let's start by recalling what GDP and NDP are.

GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product, which measures the total value of all goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific period. It's calculated using four components: Consumption (C), Investment (I), Government Spending (G), and Net Exports (NX), which is Exports (X) minus Imports (M). So the formula is GDP = C + I + G + (X - M).

NDP, or Net Domestic Product, is similar but subtracts the depreciation of capital goods. So NDP = GDP - Depreciation. Essentially, it's the total output after accounting for the wear and tear of production assets.

Now, the question is about cabbages grown in a summer garden. Let me think about whether these cabbages would be counted in GDP and/or NDP. Since the cabbages are grown for personal use, they aren't sold in the market. In economics, goods produced for personal consumption but not sold are considered part of what's called "non-market output." These aren't included in GDP because GDP only counts goods and services that are traded in the market.

Wait, but what about NDP? Since NDP is just GDP minus depreciation, if the cabbages aren't counted in GDP, they won't be in NDP either. So the cabbages are not counted in either GDP or NDP. 

Let me look at the options again. Option A says they're not counted in either GDP or NDP, which aligns with my reasoning. Option B says not counted in GDP, but that would imply they might be in NDP, which I don't think is the case. The other options refer to specific components like I, X-M, etc., but since the cabbages aren't part of any market transaction, they don't fall under any of those categories.

So the correct answer should be A.

The cabbages grown in a summer garden are not counted in either GDP or NDP because they are non-market goods not sold in the market.
