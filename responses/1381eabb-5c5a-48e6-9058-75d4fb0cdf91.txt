Okay, so I need to solve this Doppler effect problem. Let me try to remember how the Doppler effect works. I'm a bit rusty, but I think it's about how the observed frequency changes when the source is moving relative to the observer.

The problem says the car horn frequency drops from 284 to 266 cycles per second as the car passes by. Wait, so when the car is approaching, the frequency is higher, and when it's moving away, it's lower. Hmm, but in this case, the observed frequency drops, so the car must be moving away from the researcher. Or wait, maybe the opposite? Let me think again. Oh right, when a source moves towards you, the observed frequency increases (higher pitch), and when it moves away, the frequency decreases (lower pitch). So in this case, the car is moving away, because the frequency went from 284 (higher) to 266 (lower). Wait, no, the problem states that as the car passes, the frequency drops. So maybe when it's approaching, the frequency is higher, and as it moves away, it's lower. So the observed frequency drops as the car passes by, which would mean that the car is moving towards the observer initially, then moving away. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Wait, perhaps the initial frequency is when the car is approaching, so 284, and after passing, it's moving away, so 266. So the frequency observed when approaching is higher, and when moving away, lower.

I think the Doppler effect formula for when the source is moving relative to a stationary observer is:

f' = f * (v_sound) / (v_sound + v_source)

Wait, no, actually, the formula depends on whether the source is moving towards or away. Let me get that right. If the source is moving towards the observer, the observed frequency f' is higher than the emitted frequency f. The formula is f' = f * (v + vo) / (v - vs), but wait, in this case, the observer is stationary, so vo is zero. So for a moving source:

When the source is moving towards the observer (approaching), the observed frequency is f' = f * v_sound / (v_sound - vs), where vs is the speed of the source.

When the source is moving away, the observed frequency is f' = f * v_sound / (v_sound + vs).

Wait, let me check that. Alternatively, I've seen the formula written as f' = f (v + vo) / (v - vs), where vo is the observer's speed towards the source, and vs is the source's speed towards the observer.

Since the observer is stationary, vo = 0. So when the source is approaching, vs is positive, so denominator is v - vs. So f' = f * v / (v - vs). When the source is moving away, vs is positive in the denominator, so f' = f * v / (v + vs).

Wait, that makes sense. So when the car approaches, the observed frequency is higher, and when it moves away, it's lower.

In this problem, as the car passes, the observed frequency drops from 284 to 266. So before passing, when approaching, the frequency is 284, and after passing, moving away, it's 266. So we can set up two equations.

Let me denote:

f_approach = 284 = f0 * v / (v - vs)
f_depart = 266 = f0 * v / (v + vs)

Wait, but wait. I think the actual emitted frequency f0 is what the horn emits when the car is stationary. So when the car is moving towards or away, the observed frequency changes based on the Doppler effect.

So, when the car is approaching, the observed frequency is higher, f_approach = 284 = f0 * v / (v - vs)
When moving away, observed frequency is lower, f_depart = 266 = f0 * v / (v + vs)

Hmm, but I don't know f0, the actual emitted frequency when the car is stationary. But maybe I can eliminate f0 by taking the ratio of the two observed frequencies.

Let me take the ratio of f_approach to f_depart:

f_approach / f_depart = [f0 * v / (v - vs)] / [f0 * v / (v + vs)] ] 

The f0 and v terms cancel out, so:

f_approach / f_depart = (v + vs) / (v - vs)

Plugging in the numbers:

284 / 266 = (v + vs) / (v - vs)

I can compute 284 divided by 266. Let me calculate that.

284 ÷ 266 ≈ 1.0676

So,

1.0676 ≈ (v + vs) / (v - vs)

Let me denote v as the speed of sound, which is given as 1100 ft/s.

So substituting v = 1100 ft/s,

1.0676 ≈ (1100 + vs) / (1100 - vs)

Let me set up the equation:

(1100 + vs) / (1100 - vs) = 1.0676

Cross-multiplying,

1100 + vs = 1.0676 * (1100 - vs)

Expanding the right-hand side:

1100 + vs = 1.0676 * 1100 - 1.0676 * vs

Calculating 1.0676 * 1100:

1.0676 * 1100 = let's compute:

1100 * 1 = 1100
1100 * 0.06 = 66
1100 * 0.0076 ≈ 8.36
Adding them up: 1100 + 66 = 1166; 1166 + 8.36 ≈ 1174.36

So,

1100 + vs = 1174.36 - 1.0676 vs

Now, let's collect like terms:

vs + 1.0676 vs = 1174.36 - 1100

(1 + 1.0676) vs = 74.36

2.0676 vs ≈ 74.36

So,

vs ≈ 74.36 / 2.0676 ≈ let's compute that.

Calculating 74.36 ÷ 2.0676.

Hmm, 2.0676 * 36 = approx 74.43, since 2.0676*30=62.028, 2.0676*6=12.4056, so 62.028 +12.4056=74.4336. That's very close to 74.36.

So vs ≈ 36 ft/s.

Wait, but that's the speed of the car in ft/s. I need to convert that to mph.

Since 1 mile = 5280 ft, and 1 hour = 3600 seconds.

So,

36 ft/s * (3600 s / 1 hour) * (1 mile / 5280 ft) 

Let me compute:

36 * 3600 = 129600
129600 / 5280 = let's compute.

Divide numerator and denominator by 240: 129600 ÷240=540; 5280 ÷240=22.

So 540 /22 ≈ 24.545 mph.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I is 24.5 mph, which matches this. Hmm, but wait, wait. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me double-check the calculation.

We had:

284 / 266 = 1.0676

(1100 + vs)/(1100 - vs) = 1.0676

So,

1100 + vs = 1.0676*(1100 - vs)

1100 + vs = 1.0676*1100 - 1.0676*vs

1100 + vs = 1174.36 - 1.0676 vs

Bring vs terms to left and constants to right:

vs + 1.0676 vs = 1174.36 - 1100

(1 + 1.0676) vs = 74.36

2.0676 vs =74.36 → vs =74.36 / 2.0676

Let me compute 74.36 ÷2.0676.

I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me compute 2.0676 * 36 = ?

2 *36=72, 0.0676*36≈2.4336 → total 74.4336. So 2.0676*36≈74.4336, which is very close to 74.36. So 36 ft/s.

Which is 36 * 3600 /5280 mph.

Compute 36*3600=129600.

129600 /5280 = let me compute 5280 *24=126720, 5280*25=132000.

129600 - 126720 = 2880.

2880 /5280 = 0.54545...

So total is 24 + 0.54545 ≈24.545 mph, which is approximately 24.5 mph, which is option I.

But wait, the options don't have 24.5 as the first choice, but option I is 24.5.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. Is the approach correct?

Wait, I assumed that when the car is approaching, the frequency is higher (284), and when moving away, it's lower (266). But the problem states that as the automobile passes him, the frequency drops from 284 to 266. So does that mean that we're only considering the moving away scenario? Or are we considering the change as the car passes, which involves both approaching and moving away?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Because when the car is at rest, the frequency is f0. When it's approaching, observed frequency is higher (f_approach =284), and when moving away, it's lower (f_depart=266). So using the two observed frequencies, I can set up the ratio.

Alternatively, maybe I should have considered that the car is moving towards the observer first, then moving away. But the problem states that as the car passes, the frequency drops, so perhaps I should model the situation when the car is moving towards, then when moving away.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is simplified. Maybe the car is moving towards the observer, and the observed frequency is 284, and when it moves away, it's 266. So we can calculate the speed using either approach.

Wait, but the way I did it earlier gives 24.5 mph, which is one of the options, option I. But the options include 24.5 as option I, which is correct.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps using the formula for when the source is moving towards and then away, but perhaps the problem expects me to use the approximate formula for speed.

Wait, another approach: the change in frequency is due to the Doppler shift. The formula for the observed frequency when the source is moving towards is f' = f0 (v + vo) / (v - vs), but if the observer is stationary, vo=0, so f' = f0 v/(v - vs).

Similarly, when the source is moving away, f' = f0 v/(v + vs).

Wait, but in this problem, the observed frequencies are 284 and 266 when the car is approaching and moving away, respectively. So, using these two equations:

284 = f0 * v/(v - vs)
266 = f0 * v/(v + vs)

Dividing the two equations:

284/266 = (v + vs)/(v - vs)

Which is what I did earlier, leading to vs≈36 ft/s, which is 24.5 mph.

So the answer should be option I:24.5 mph.

Wait, but looking at the options given:

A:30, B:20, C:32, D:28.5, E:26, F:22, G:18, H:17, I:24.5, J:35.

Yes, I is 24.5.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the steps.

Compute 284/266: let me calculate that accurately.

284 ÷ 266 = let's compute:

266 * 1 =266, 284-266=18.

So 1.0676 is correct.

So (1100 + vs)/(1100 - vs) =1.0676.

Cross multiply: 1100 + vs =1.0676*(1100 - vs).

Compute 1.0676*1100: 1100 * 1=1100, 1100*0.0676=74.36, so total 1174.36.

So, 1100 + vs = 1174.36 -1.0676*vs.

Bring vs terms to left: vs +1.0676 vs =1174.36 -1100=74.36.

So, 2.0676*vs=74.36 → vs=74.36/2.0676 ≈36 ft/s.

Convert 36 ft/s to mph: 36 *3600/5280.

Compute 36*3600=129600.

129600 ÷5280= let's compute:

5280 *24=126720. 129600-126720=2880.

2880/5280= 0.54545...

So 24.545...≈24.5 mph.

Yes, that's correct.

So the answer should be option I:24.5 mph.

The problem involves calculating the speed of a car using the Doppler effect. The observed frequency drops from 284 Hz (when approaching) to 266 Hz (when moving away). Using the Doppler effect formula for a moving source and a stationary observer, the ratio of the observed frequencies is used to derive the car's speed. Solving the equations yields a speed of approximately 24.5 mph, corresponding to option I.
