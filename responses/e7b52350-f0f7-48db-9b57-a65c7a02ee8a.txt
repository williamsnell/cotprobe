Alright, let's tackle this question step by step. I'm a bit new to VAR models, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking about the advantages of using the VAR approach compared to full structural models. The options are i, ii, iii, iv, and we need to pick which are correct.

First, I'll recall what I know about VAR models. VAR stands for Vector Autoregressive model. From what I remember, VAR models are often used in economics and finance to capture the relationships between multiple time series variables. They don't require as much theory as structural models, which might be an advantage.

Looking at the options:

i) VARs receive strong motivation from financial and economic theory. Hmm, I think this might not be correct. I thought VAR models are atheoretical, meaning they don't rely heavily on specific economic theories. Instead, they're more data-driven, capturing correlations without assuming causation. So maybe i is not an advantage of VAR over structural models because structural models are more theory-based.

ii) VARs in their reduced forms can be used easily to produce time-series forecasts. Yes, I remember that one of the main uses of VAR models is forecasting. They're straightforward for generating forecasts because they're reduced forms, which are just estimated equations without imposing restrictions. So ii is correct.

iii) VAR models are typically highly parsimonious. Parsimonious means they have few parameters, making them simpler. But wait, I thought that structural models often have more restrictions, which could make them more parsimonious. Or maybe it's the other way around? No, wait. Structural models require more theory, which might lead to more restrictions and thus a more parsimonious model. But I think VAR models are less parsimonious because they include more lagged variables and all variables are interdependent. So iii might not be correct. Wait, but sometimes when you have a lot of variables, a VAR can be more complex. Maybe I'm getting this mixed up. I'll have to think more.

iv) OLS can be applied separately to each equation in a reduced form VAR. Yes, that sounds right. In a reduced form VAR, each equation is estimated using OLS, and since they're in reduced form, there's no simultaneity issue because the errors are uncorrelated. So iv is correct.

Wait, going back to iii. If VAR models are less restrictive, they might actually have more parameters, making them less parsimonious than structural models. Because structural models impose more restrictions, they have fewer parameters. So if the question is about the advantages of VAR, then iii might not be a correct advantage because it's actually more parsimonious in structural models. So iii is incorrect.

So, let's summarize:

i) Incorrect (VARs aren't strongly motivated by theory)
ii) Correct
iii) Incorrect (VARs are less parsimonious)
iv) Correct

So the correct options are ii and iv. Now, looking at the options, which ones include ii and iv?

Looking at the options:

A: i, ii, iii → No, because i and iii are wrong
B: i, iii, iv → No
C: ii, iii, iv → No, because iii is wrong
D: i and iv → No, i is wrong
E: ii and iii → No, iii is wrong
F: i and ii → No
G: ii and iv → Yes, this is the pair
H: iii and iv → No
I: All four → No
J: i and iii → No

So the correct answer should be G: (ii) and (iv) only.
</think>

The correct answer is G: (ii) and (iv) only.

The reasoning is as follows:

- **i)** Incorrect: VAR models are not strongly motivated by financial and economic theory; they are more data-driven and atheoretical.
- **ii)** Correct: VARs in reduced form are easy to use for time-series forecasting.
- **iii)** Incorrect: VAR models are less parsimonious compared to structural models, which impose more restrictions.
- **iv)** Correct: OLS can be applied separately to each equation in a reduced form VAR.

Thus, the correct options are **(ii)** and **(iv)**.

Answer: G
