Question:

A 46-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 1, comes to the office because of a 2-week history of black discharge from her right nipple. The patient had mammography and ultrasonography of the breasts 2 months ago for evaluation of increased glandularity, palpated in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast, noted at her most recent annual examination. The studies showed likely benign findings with recommended follow-up in 6 months. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable and she takes no medications. BMI is 30 kg/m2 . Vital signs are normal. Palpation of the right breast discloses glandularity in the upper outer quadrant but no other masses. There is scant, black discharge from the right nipple. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?

Options:

A: Core needle biopsy of the right breast
B: Ductography
C: Start on antifungal treatment
D: Excisional biopsy of glandular tissue
E: MRI of the right breast
F: Fine needle aspiration of the right nipple discharge
G: Mammography of the left breast
H: Repeat ultrasonography of the right breast
I: Histopathological study of the discharge
J: Repeat mammography

Okay, so I have this case about a 46-year-old woman with some breast symptoms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Her history: She's gravida 1, para 1, which means she's had one pregnancy and one child. She comes in because of black discharge from her right nipple for two weeks. Two months ago, she had mammography and ultrasonography for increased glandularity in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast, which was noted during her annual exam. The results were "likely benign" with follow-up in six months. She's otherwise healthy, no medications, BMI 30.

On exam: Right breast has glandularity in the same upper outer area, no other masses. There's scant, black discharge from the nipple.

So, the question is, what's the next step in diagnosis?

Let me think about what each option means.

Option A: Core needle biopsy. That's a common way to get tissue samples, often after imaging shows a suspicious mass.

Option B: Ductography, also known as mammary ductography. This is a radiological procedure where contrast is injected into the nipple ducts to look for abnormalities, like ductal masses or calcifications. It's typically used when there's nipple discharge, especially if it's from a single duct.

Option C: Antifungal treatment. Black discharge could be due to something like an infection, maybe fungal. But she had imaging done, and it was likely benign. Also, the discharge is from the nipple, which is more concerning for a breast issue than an infection elsewhere.

Option D: Excisional biopsy. This would involve removing the entire mass. But since she just had imaging suggesting benign findings, maybe they don't want to do an excision yet unless imaging is suspicious.

Option E: MRI. MRI is good for further imaging, especially if there's dense breasts. But she already had a mammogram and ultrasound, and they were benign. Maybe not the first step here.

Option F: Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the discharge. FNA is often used for palpable masses to get cells for cytology. But in this case, the discharge itself could be examined. However, sometimes the discharge's appearance (like color) can suggest the cause, but the next step is often to find the source.

Option G: Mammography of the left breast. She had right breast issues; unless there's a reason to suspect the left, this might not be necessary right now.

Option H: Repeat ultrasound. She had it two months ago. If they're concerned about changes, they might repeat it, but if the initial was benign and she's stable, maybe not.

Option I: Histopathological study of the discharge. That would involve looking at the discharge under a microscope. It might help determine if it's from the breast or an infection, but I'm not sure if that's the next immediate step.

Option J: Repeat mammography. If the initial mammogram was negative, maybe they want to rule out any changes, but the discharge is a new symptom.

So, thinking about this: she has a new onset of nipple discharge, which can be a concerning symptom. The discharge is black, which is a bit unusualâ€”typically, nipple discharge can be clear, white, greenish, etc., but black is less common. The discharge could be due to a ductal issue, like a ductal papilloma, which can cause bloody or colored discharge.

Ductography (option B) is a method used to evaluate the ducts when there's nipple discharge. It can show if there's a mass within the ducts. Alternatively, FNA (option F) could be done to see if the discharge contains cancer cells or if it's just secretions.

But wait, the patient had a recent mammogram and ultrasound, which were likely benign. However, the discharge is a new symptom. So, the next step might be to evaluate the discharge. Ductography can help identify the source, especially if it's a single duct. Alternatively, FNA could be done, but sometimes the discharge itself doesn't give enough info, and you need to image the ducts.

Another thought: the initial imaging was two months ago, and now she has a discharge. Maybe the discharge is from a mass that wasn't seen on the previous imaging, especially if it's a small ductal papilloma.

In some guidelines, when a patient has nipple discharge, especially unilateral and bloody, imaging such as ductography or mammogram with ductography might be recommended. Alternatively, FNA of the discharge can be done, but if the discharge is scant, FNA might not get enough material.

Wait, but the discharge is black. Could that be due to something else, like medication, or could it be from a trauma or something? The patient says she takes no medications, so that's less likely. Also, she's not on anything that could cause discoloration.

So, considering the options, the most appropriate next step would be to evaluate the ducts. Ductography (option B) or FNA (option F). But sometimes, FNA is not conclusive for benign or malignant, especially if the discharge is not enough. Alternatively, core needle biopsy (option A) can be done if a mass is palpable.

Wait, on palpation, she has glandularity but no other masses. So, no palpable mass. If there's no mass, then maybe FNA isn't the best option. Because FNA is typically for palpable masses. So, if she has a discharge but no mass, ductography might be better to look for ductal abnormalities.

Alternatively, sometimes in cases where the discharge is suspicious, they might do a ductogram to see if there's a mass in the duct. If that's positive, then proceed to biopsy.

So, putting it all together, the next step would be to do a ductogram (option B) to evaluate the ducts for any abnormalities causing the discharge. Alternatively, if she had a mass, a core needle biopsy would be next, but since she doesn't have a mass, maybe ductography is better.

Another point: she had an ultrasound two months ago. Ultrasound can sometimes miss small papillomas, especially in the upper outer quadrant where this is located. So, maybe doing a ductogram could find a lesion in the duct that wasn't seen on ultrasound.

Alternatively, fine needle aspiration of the discharge (option F) could be done, but if the discharge is scant, it might not yield enough cells. Also, the discharge's color (black) is unusual and might warrant further imaging.

Wait, but the discharge is from the right nipple. So, maybe the next step is to do a nipple discharge evaluation, which could include ductography or FNA.

In clinical practice, when a patient presents with nipple discharge, especially a new one, imaging of the ducts is often done. So, I'm leaning towards option B: ductography.

Alternatively, some might suggest FNA of the discharge (option F) to check for malignancy. But if the discharge is from a duct, which is more likely in this case, ductography would help find the source.

So, the options are B and F. Which is more appropriate? If the discharge is from a single duct, ductography can show that. If it's from a mass, then FNA or biopsy would be next. But since she doesn't have a palpable mass, ductography seems more appropriate.

Wait, but sometimes, the presence of black discharge could suggest a more concerning lesion. However, in the absence of a mass, imaging the ducts is the way to go.

So, the answer is B: Ductography.
</think>

The patient is a 46-year-old woman presenting with a 2-week history of black discharge from her right nipple. She had mammography and ultrasonography 2 months ago for increased glandularity in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast, which were interpreted as likely benign with follow-up recommended in 6 months. On examination, she has glandularity in the same area but no palpable masses and scant black discharge from the right nipple.

The most appropriate next step is to evaluate the nipple discharge. Ductography (option B) is a radiological procedure that allows visualization of the mammary ducts and can identify abnormalities such as papillomas or calcifications, which may be the source of the discharge. While fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the discharge (option F) could provide cytological information, it is less conclusive in the absence of a palpable mass and may not yield sufficient material if the discharge is scant. Given the absence of a palpable mass and the need to further evaluate the ducts, ductography is the more appropriate next step.
