Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this probability question. Let me read it again. The question is about tossing a penny three times and finding the probability of getting exactly two heads and one tail. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with coins, each toss is an independent event. So each toss has two possible outcomes: heads (H) or tails (T), each with a probability of 1/2. Since we're tossing the penny three times, there are a total of 2^3 = 8 possible outcomes, right?

Now, I need to find how many of these outcomes have exactly two heads and one tail. Let me list them out. The possible outcomes are:

1. HHH
2. HHT
3. HTH
4. HTT
5. THH
6. THT
7. TTH
8. TTT

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. Each toss is independent, so the possible sequences are all combinations of H and T of length 3. The number of such sequences is indeed 8.

Now, I need to count how many of these have exactly two heads and one tail. Looking at the list:

- HHT: two H, one T
- HTH: two H, one T
- THH: two H, one T
- The others either have three H, two T, or one H, two T.

So there are three outcomes that meet the condition: HHT, HTH, THH. That means 3 favorable outcomes.

Since each outcome is equally likely, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So that's 3/8.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Another way to approach this is using combinations. The number of ways to get exactly two heads in three tosses is given by the combination formula: C(3,2) = 3. And since each of these has a probability of (1/2)^3 = 1/8, the total probability is 3*(1/8) = 3/8.

So the answer should be 3/8, which corresponds to option H.

The probability of getting exactly two heads and one tail in three coin tosses is calculated by identifying the number of favorable outcomes. There are 3 such outcomes (HHT, HTH, THH) out of a total of 8 possible outcomes. Thus, the probability is 3/8.

Answer: H
