Okay, so I have this biology question about mitochondria and chloroplasts, and I need to figure out which statement is correct. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that mitochondria and chloroplasts are organelles found in eukaryotic cells. Mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell, providing energy through cellular respiration. Chloroplasts are where photosynthesis happens, which is only in plants and some other organisms.

Wait, so plants have both mitochondria and chloroplasts, right? Because they need energy from photosynthesis and also use mitochondria for other energy needs. Animals, on the other hand, don't have chloroplasts because they can't photosynthesize; they get their energy from food. So animals have mitochondria but no chloroplasts.

What about fungi? Fungi are like mushrooms or yeast. They don't photosynthesize either, so they don't have chloroplasts. But they do need energy, so they must have mitochondria. So fungi have mitochondria but no chloroplasts.

Let me look at the options now.

Option A: Plants, animals, and fungi all have both. No, that's not right because animals and fungi don't have chloroplasts.

Option B: Plants and fungi have chloroplasts but no mitochondria; animals have only mitochondria. Wait, no. Plants have both. Fungi don't have chloroplasts, but they do have mitochondria. So this option is wrong.

Option C: Animals have both, plants and fungi have only chloroplasts. No, animals don't have chloroplasts. Plants have both, fungi have mitochondria only.

Option D: Plants and animals have chloroplasts but no mitochondria; fungi have only mitochondria. No, animals don't have chloroplasts. Plants have both.

Option E: Plants and animals have mitochondria but no chloroplasts; fungi have only chloroplasts. No, plants have chloroplasts as well.

Option F: Plants have chloroplasts but no mitochondria; fungi have mitochondria but no chloroplasts. No, plants have both, so F is wrong.

Option G: Plants have chloroplasts but no mitochondria; animals have mitochondria but no chloroplasts. Again, plants have both, so G is incorrect.

Option H: Animals and fungi have both; plants have only mitochondria. No, plants have chloroplasts too.

Option I: Plants have both; animals and fungi have only mitochondria. That makes sense. Plants have chloroplasts and mitochondria. Animals and fungi have mitochondria but no chloroplasts. So I think I is correct.

Option J: Plants and fungi have mitochondria but no chloroplasts; animals have only chloroplasts. No, that's the opposite.

So the correct answer should be option I.

The correct answer is I. Plants have both chloroplasts and mitochondria, while animals and fungi have only mitochondria.

I

Answer: I
