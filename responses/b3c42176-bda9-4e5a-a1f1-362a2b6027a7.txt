Question:

A plaintiff sued the insurer of her home after the insurer denied coverage for water damage to the home allegedly caused by a frozen plastic pipe that burst. At trial, the insurer called as an expert witness an engineer, who testified that the pipe had burst because of age rather than freezing. On cross-examination, the engineer admitted that five years earlier, he had been convicted of tax fraud, even though he had asserted that it was his accountant's error. In response, the insurer calls a witness, who is well acquainted with the engineer and his reputation, to testify that (1) in the witness's opinion, the engineer is a truthful person, and (2) the engineer's neighbors all describe him as a truthful person. How much, if any, of the witness's testimony is admissible?

Options:

A: None of the testimony is admissible, because it is collateral, having no bearing on the engineer's qualifications as an expert.
B: Only the portion concerning the engineer's reputation is admissible, because where both opinion and reputation evidence are available, only the latter is admissible under a rule of preference.
C: Both portions of the testimony are admissible, but only as they relate to the engineer's truthfulness, not his expertise.
D: None of the testimony is admissible, because character evidence is not relevant to the engineer's expertise.
E: All of the testimony is admissible to support the engineer's credibility.
F: Only the portion concerning the engineer's reputation is admissible, as it is directly relevant to his character for truthfulness.
G: Only the portion concerning the witness's opinion of the engineer's character is admissible, as it directly relates to his credibility.
H: Only the portion concerning the witness's opinion of the engineer's character, because the witness's reporting of the neighbors' comments is hearsay.
I: None of the testimony is admissible, because the witness is biased due to their acquaintance with the engineer.
J: All of the testimony is admissible, but the judge must instruct the jury to consider the engineer's past conviction.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence law question. Let me read it carefully.

The scenario is that a plaintiff sued her home insurer for denying coverage due to water damage from a frozen pipe that burst. The insurer called an expert engineer who testified the pipe burst because of age, not freezing. On cross-examination, the engineer admitted to a five-year-old conviction for tax fraud, claiming it was his accountant's error. Now, the insurer is calling another witness who knows the engineer well. This witness is going to testify two things: (1) in his opinion, the engineer is truthful, and (2) the engineer's neighbors all say he's truthful.

The question is about how much of this witness's testimony is admissible.

So, I need to think about what evidence is admissible when a witness's credibility is attacked. I remember that when a witness's character is attacked, the opposing party can bring up evidence of their good character. But there are specific rules about this.

First, the engineer was an expert witness. Under the rules of evidence, an expert's credibility can be attacked like any other witness, but their expertise is based on their knowledge and skill, not just their character. So, if the opposing side attacks the expert's character, the other side can respond with evidence of the expert's good character.

In this case, the engineer's credibility was attacked by bringing up his past conviction for tax fraud. That's a conviction for a crime involving dishonesty, which affects his character for truthfulness. So the insurer is now trying to rebut that by showing the engineer is truthful.

The witness is testifying about the engineer's reputation and his opinion that the engineer is truthful. I think reputation evidence and opinion testimony are both ways to prove a witness's character. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the rules here.

I recall that under the Federal Rules of Evidence, a witness's credibility can be supported by evidence of their good character. Specifically, a witness may testify about another's reputation for truthfulness (Rule 405(a)), and another witness can offer an opinion about that person's character (Rule 405(b)). So both the opinion and reputation evidence are admissible for that purpose.

But wait, is there any restriction? I think that character evidence is generally allowed when the witness's character is in issue, which it is here because their credibility is being attacked. So the insurer is allowed to present evidence about the engineer's good character to counter the attack.

Looking at the options:

Option B says only the reputation part is admissible because there's a rule of preference. I'm not sure about that. I thought both opinion and reputation can be used, but maybe the rules prefer reputation evidence over opinion. Let me check. Rule 405(a) allows reputation testimony, and (b) allows opinion testimony. But some jurisdictions might prefer reputation, but the rules themselves don't say that. So I think both are admissible.

Option F says only the reputation part is admissible. Option C says both are admissible but only about truthfulness. Option E says all testimony is admissible to support credibility.

Wait, the witness is testifying both about his opinion and about what the neighbors say. The neighbors' statements would be hearsay unless they fall under a hearsay exception. But the witness is testifying about what the neighbors say, which is hearsay because it's an out-of-court statement offered for the truth. Unless it's offered to show the engineer's reputation, which is non-hearsay because it's about the general reputation, not the truth of the matter asserted. Wait, no—when a witness testifies about what others have said, that's hearsay. But if it's about reputation, maybe it's allowed under Rule 803(21), which allows reputation testimony without the need for the declarant to testify.

But in this case, the witness is testifying about the neighbors' descriptions, which might be hearsay. So the part about the neighbors' statements could be inadmissible unless it's offered for reputation, which is non-hearsay. Alternatively, the witness can testify about the engineer's reputation without recounting specific statements.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: when a witness testifies about a person's reputation in the community for truthfulness, that's non-hearsay because it's about the reputation, not the truth of the matter. So the witness can say, "I know that Engineer X has a reputation in the community for being truthful," without having to call the neighbors to testify. But if the witness testifies about specific statements made by neighbors, like "Neighbor A said he's truthful," that's hearsay unless an exception applies.

So in the question, the witness is testifying that "the engineer's neighbors all describe him as a truthful person." That seems like the witness is recounting what the neighbors said, which is hearsay. But maybe the witness is testifying about the engineer's reputation, not individual statements. It's a bit ambiguous.

If the witness is testifying about the engineer's reputation, then it's non-hearsay. If he's testifying about what others said, that's hearsay. So perhaps the second part is inadmissible as hearsay unless it's for reputation.

Alternatively, the witness can give his opinion about the engineer's character, which is allowed under Rule 405(b). So the witness can say, "In my opinion, Engineer X is truthful," and that's admissible. But the part about the neighbors' descriptions might be hearsay unless it's about reputation.

Wait, the witness is testifying that the engineer's neighbors describe him as truthful. That sounds like the witness is relating what the neighbors said, which is hearsay. Unless it's being offered to show the engineer's reputation, in which case it's admissible as reputation evidence.

Hmm. So the witness is trying to support the engineer's reputation for truthfulness by testifying that his neighbors describe him that way. That could be proper as reputation evidence under Rule 405(a). Alternatively, the witness is testifying about specific statements, which would be hearsay, but if it's about reputation, it's allowed.

So, putting it together, both the opinion and the reputation evidence are admissible. Therefore, the testimony about the engineer's reputation and the witness's opinion are both admissible to support the engineer's credibility.

Looking back at the options:

Option C says both are admissible but only as they relate to truthfulness, which aligns with what I'm thinking. But wait, the options are about how much is admissible. Option F says only the reputation part is admissible because it's directly relevant. Option E says all is admissible.

Wait, the witness's opinion is about the engineer's character, which is allowed. But the part about the neighbors' descriptions—if that's hearsay, then it's inadmissible unless it's for reputation.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The witness can testify about the engineer's reputation for truthfulness without needing to call the neighbors. So the testimony that the engineer's neighbors describe him as truthful is being offered to show his reputation, which is non-hearsay. So the witness can testify about the engineer's reputation, and also give their opinion about the engineer's character.

So both parts are admissible.

Looking at the options, option E says all testimony is admissible to support the engineer's credibility. But wait, the part about the neighbors could be hearsay. Alternatively, maybe the witness is testifying about the engineer's reputation, which is non-hearsay.

Wait, let me think again. If the witness says, "The engineer's neighbors all describe him as truthful," that's hearsay because it's an out-of-court statement offered for the truth. But if the witness is testifying to the engineer's reputation, which is a matter of community opinion, then it's non-hearsay. So the witness can testify about the engineer's reputation for truthfulness, which would include that the neighbors have that view.

But if the witness is testifying about specific statements made by the neighbors, that's hearsay. So perhaps the way the question is phrased, the witness is testifying about what the neighbors describe, which is hearsay. Therefore, that part might not be admissible unless an exception applies.

But wait, under Rule 405(a), a witness may testify about a person's reputation by describing it, without needing to call the declarants. So the witness can say, "Engineer X has a reputation in the community for being truthful," which is non-hearsay. But if the witness is testifying that "Neighbor A says he's truthful, and Neighbor B says the same," that would be hearsay unless offered for reputation.

But in the question, the witness says, "the engineer's neighbors all describe him as a truthful person." If the witness is testifying about the general reputation, that's allowed. So perhaps the second part is admissible as reputation evidence.

Alternatively, if the witness is testifying about specific statements, that's hearsay. But I think the way it's phrased, it's about the engineer's reputation, so it's non-hearsay.

In that case, both the witness's opinion and the reputation evidence are admissible. So the answer would be option E: all of the testimony is admissible to support the engineer's credibility.

But wait, another angle: the engineer is an expert witness. His credibility is important, but is character evidence relevant to his expertise? I think it's only relevant to his truthfulness as a witness, not his expertise. So the testimony about his character is about credibility, not expertise.

So the testimony is admissible to support his credibility, which is relevant because his credibility was attacked.

So the answer should be E. But wait, option C says both are admissible but only as they relate to truthfulness, not expertise. That makes sense because the testimony is about his character for truthfulness, which affects his credibility.

Alternatively, option F says only the reputation part is admissible. But I think both the opinion and the reputation are admissible.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the opinion of a witness about another's character can be admissible, but perhaps the rules prefer reputation evidence. Or maybe both are allowed.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: Both portions are admissible, but only as they relate to the engineer's truthfulness, not his expertise.

Option E: All of the testimony is admissible to support the engineer's credibility.

Option F: Only the reputation part is admissible.

Hmm. The key is whether both opinion and reputation evidence are admissible. Under Rule 405, both are allowed. So the witness can testify about their opinion and about the reputation.

So the testimony about the witness's opinion (1) and the reputation (2) are both admissible. So the answer would be E, but I'm not sure because option C says both are admissible but only about truthfulness.

Wait, looking at the options, option C says both are admissible, but only as they relate to truthfulness, not expertise. That seems correct because the engineer's expertise is about being an engineer, not his character. So the testimony is about his credibility, which is about truthfulness.

So the correct answer is C.
</think>

The question revolves around the admissibility of testimony regarding an expert witness's credibility after his character was attacked. The engineer's credibility was challenged due to a past conviction for tax fraud, and the insurer called a witness to testify about the engineer's reputation and character. The key issue is whether the witness's testimony about the engineer's reputation and the witness's opinion on the engineer's character are admissible.

Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, when a witness's credibility is attacked, the opposing party may introduce evidence of the witness's good character. This includes both reputation evidence (Rule 405(a)) and opinion testimony about the witness's character (Rule 405(b)). The testimony in question includes the witness's opinion that the engineer is truthful and the engineer's neighbors describing him as truthful. 

The portion of the testimony about the engineer's reputation for truthfulness is admissible as non-hearsay under Rule 405(a), as it pertains to the engineer's reputation in the community. The witness's opinion about the engineer's character is also admissible under Rule 405(b). However, the testimony is limited to the engineer's truthfulness and does not pertain to his expertise as an engineer. Therefore, both portions of the testimony are admissible but only as they relate to the engineer's credibility, specifically his truthfulness.

Option C correctly states that both portions of the testimony are admissible, but only as they relate to the engineer's truthfulness, not his expertise. This aligns with the rules of evidence and the purpose of the testimony, which is to rebut the attack on the engineer's credibility.

**Answer: C**
