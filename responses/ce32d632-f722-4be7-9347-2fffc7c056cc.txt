Question:

Carson owned 40% of the outstanding stock of a C corporation. During a tax year, the corporation reported $400,000 in taxable income and distributed a total of $70,000 in cash dividends to its shareholders. Carson accurately reported $28,000 in gross income on Carson’s individual tax return. If the corporation had been an S corporation and the distributions to the owners had been proportionate, how much income would Carson have reported on Carson’s individual return?

Options:

A: $132,000
B: $160,000
C: $140,000
D: $100,000
E: $150,000
F: $210,000
G: $188,000
H: $28,000
I: $180,000
J: $200,000

Okay, let's try to figure out this tax question. So, the question is about Carson owning 40% of a C corporation and then considering what would happen if it were an S corporation. Hmm, I remember that C corporations and S corporations have different tax treatment regarding dividends and income distribution.

First, in the C corporation scenario, the corporation reported $400,000 in taxable income. Since it's a C corp, the corporation would pay taxes on that income. But dividends paid by a C corporation are generally not taxed at the corporate level but are taxable to the shareholders. Wait, no, actually, the C corporation pays taxes on its taxable income, and then the shareholders pay taxes on the dividends they receive. So, in this case, the corporation has distributed $70,000 in dividends. But since it's a C corp, the dividends are taxable to the shareholders, but the C corp itself doesn't deduct the dividends when calculating its taxable income. So the $70k is after the corporate tax.

But the question is about what would happen if the corporation were an S corporation. S corps have different rules. For an S corporation, the income, losses, and credits pass through to the shareholders each year, regardless of whether dividends are paid. So, the shareholders report their share of the corporation's income on their individual tax returns, even if they didn't receive any cash dividends.

Wait, but the question mentions that the distributions are proportionate. So, in the C corp case, Carson received a portion of the $70k based on his 40% ownership. So, 40% of $70k is $28k, which is why he reported $28k as income. But wait, no, in C corps, dividends are taxable, but the income is separate from the corporation's taxable income. So the corporation's taxable income is $400k, but the dividends are $70k, which is separate. So the shareholders only pay taxes on the dividends, not on the full income.

But with an S corporation, the situation is different. The S corp's income is passed through to the shareholders. So, regardless of whether distributions are made, the shareholders include their share of the corporation's income on their individual returns. So, in this case, if the corporation had been an S corp, Carson would have to report his 40% share of the $400k taxable income. So that would be 40% of $400k, which is $160k. 

Wait, but are there any exceptions or other factors I'm missing? For example, S corps require that shareholders take draws (distributions) that are proportionate to their ownership, otherwise they might have some issues, but in this question, it's stated that the distributions are proportionate, so that shouldn't affect the calculation. 

So, in the C corp, Carson's reported income was $28k, which is 40% of $70k. But in the S corp scenario, he would report 40% of the $400k taxable income, which is $160k. So looking at the options, option B is $160k.

The correct answer is B: $160,000. In an S corporation, the income is passed through to shareholders proportionally, so Carson would report 40% of $400,000.
