Alright, let's try to figure out this question. So, the question is about private regulation and what it's attributed to. The sentence structure is a bit tricky, but I'll break it down.

The question says: "The rise in business led, private regulation can be attributed to: encouragement of a _______ approach from industry, _________ and _______ achievement of objectives."

So, the blank spaces need to be filled with three words or phrases from the options. The options are A through J, each providing three terms.

I remember that private regulation often involves industry taking a proactive approach rather than waiting for government regulations. So, the first blank is likely "Proactive." Let me check the options that start with Proactive. Options A, D, E, and F.

Next, the sentence talks about the second blank and the third, which relate to the achievement of objectives. The options for the second part include things like cost effectiveness, heightened costs, cost ineffectiveness, etc. I think cost effectiveness is a positive outcome, so that might be a good fit. So, looking for Proactive and Cost effectiveness. That leaves options A, E.

Then the last part is about the speed of achieving objectives. If private regulation is encouraged, it might lead to faster achievement because companies can adapt quicker. So the third blank should be "Faster." Let me see which options have Proactive, Cost effectiveness, and Faster. Option A is Proactive, Cost effectiveness, Faster, which fits. Option E has Proactive, Cost effectiveness, Slower, which doesn't make sense because faster achievement is better.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be A.
