Okay, I'm trying to figure out this question about Ashford's argument regarding aid agencies and dependency. The question is asking what Ashford argues we shouldn't conclude just because we worry about causing dependency.

So, the question is phrased as: "does not mean that we should" followed by the options. I need to find which option is something Ashford would say we shouldn't do based on his argument.

First, let's break down what the worry about dependency implies. People might worry that giving aid could make the recipients too dependent, so they can't help themselves. But Ashford is saying that this worry doesn't lead to the conclusion that we should... whatever the option is.

Looking at the options:

A: suggest that aid agencies are the only solution. Well, if dependency is a worry, maybe Ashford is against saying aid is the only way. So, perhaps this is what we shouldn't do.

B: abandon the poor. That seems counterintuitive because if we're worried about dependency, we might not abandon them but find other ways. So this might be what we shouldn't do, meaning Ashford argues we shouldn't abandon them.

C: argue aid agencies are unjust. Not sure. The worry isn't about the agencies being unjust, but dependency.

D: increase aid. If dependency is a worry, maybe he's against increasing aid, but I'm not sure. Or maybe he's suggesting other solutions besides just more aid.

E: ignore economic justice. Economic justice is about systemic issues, so worrying about dependency doesn't mean we should ignore that. So perhaps E is something we shouldn't do.

F: force self-sufficiency. That's harsh. Worrying about dependency doesn't mean we should force them to be self-sufficient, maybe we should find a balance.

G: stop all aid. Again, if we stop aid, that's abandoning, which seems wrong. So perhaps G is something we shouldn't do.

H: accept no negative duties. Negative duties mean not acting. So if we accept we have no duty, we might not help. But the worry about dependency doesn't mean we have no duty; perhaps it's the opposite.

I: adopt social contract. Not sure how this ties in. Maybe it's about frameworks, but not directly related to dependency worries.

J: abolish aid agencies. That's extreme; worrying about dependency doesn't mean abolishing aid.

Now, the question is what we shouldn't do because of the dependency worry. So, the correct answer is the option that is the wrong conclusion to draw from the worry.

Ashford's point is that worrying about dependency doesn't mean we should abandon the poor. So, the worry doesn't mean we should stop helping. So, the answer is B: abandon the world's poor.

Wait, let me think again. The question is what we shouldn't do because of the worry. So, the worry doesn't lead us to abandon the poor. So, the correct answer is B.
</think>

The correct answer is B: abandon the world's poor to their unjust predicament. Ashford argues that concerns about dependency on aid agencies do not justify neglecting the world's poor. The worry about dependency should not lead us to abandon those in need but rather seek alternative solutions or balance aid with other approaches.
