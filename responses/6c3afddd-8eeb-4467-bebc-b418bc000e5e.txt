Alright, so I've got this logic problem to solve. It's about determining whether a set of propositions is consistent using indirect truth tables. If the set is consistent, I need to pick a consistent valuation from the options given.

Let me break down the problem step by step. The propositions given are:

1. ~N ≡ (O · P)
2. ~O ⊃ Q
3. N · ~Q

I need to check if these can all be true at the same time. If they can, the set is consistent, and I have to find one such valuation. If not, the set is inconsistent.

First, I'll write down each proposition clearly.

1. The first proposition is a biconditional: The negation of N is equivalent to the conjunction of O and P. So, ~N if and only if O and P are both true.

2. The second is an implication: If not O, then Q. So, whenever O is false, Q must be true. Alternatively, this can be read as ~O → Q, which is logically equivalent to O ∨ Q.

3. The third proposition is a conjunction: N is true, and Q is false. So, N must be true, and Q must be false.

Now, to check consistency, I can use an indirect truth table. The idea is to assume the set is inconsistent, which would mean that the conjunction of all propositions is a contradiction. If I can derive a contradiction, then the set is inconsistent. If not, it's consistent.

Alternatively, since the set is small (four variables: N, O, P, Q), I could also construct a truth table and check for a row where all propositions are true.

But since the question mentions using indirect truth tables, I think the method involves assuming the negation of consistency and deriving a contradiction.

Let me outline the steps for the indirect method:

1. Assume that the set is inconsistent. That means there's no possible valuation where all propositions are true. So, for all valuations, at least one proposition is false. But since we're assuming inconsistency, we can instead look for a contradiction in the set.

2. Alternatively, another way is to check if the set entails a contradiction. If the set entails both a statement and its negation, then it's inconsistent.

Wait, maybe I should approach this by trying to find a valuation where all three propositions are true. If such a valuation exists, the set is consistent.

Let me try to construct such a valuation.

From proposition 3: N must be true, and Q must be false.

So, N = T, Q = F.

Now, from proposition 2: ~O ⊃ Q. Since Q is F, the implication ~O ⊃ Q is equivalent to ~O → F, which is equivalent to T only if ~O is F. So, ~O must be F → O must be T.

So, O = T.

Now, with O = T, let's look at proposition 1: ~N ≡ (O · P).

We know N is T, so ~N is F. So, F ≡ (T · P). The right side is T · P, which is P. So, F ≡ P, which means P must be F because F ≡ F is true, but F ≡ T is false. So, for the biconditional to hold, P must be F.

Wait, let me double-check that. The biconditional (equivalence) is true when both sides are the same. So, ~N is F, and (O · P) is T · P, which is P. So, F ≡ P. So, for F ≡ P to be true, P must be F. Because F ≡ F is true, and F ≡ T is false.

So, P = F.

So, putting it all together:

N = T

O = T

P = F

Q = F

Now, let's check each proposition with these values.

1. ~N ≡ (O · P): ~T is F. O is T, P is F → T · F = F. So, F ≡ F → True.

2. ~O ⊃ Q: ~T is F. F → Q (which is F) → F → F is True? Wait, no. Wait, in logic, an implication F → F is actually True. Because only T → F is False. So, yes, this holds.

3. N · ~Q: T · ~F → T · T → T. So, that's True.

So, all three propositions are true under this valuation. Therefore, the set is consistent.

Now, looking at the options, I need to see which option states that the set is consistent and provides this specific valuation.

Looking at the options:

A: Inconsistent. Inconsistent valuation when N, O, P, and Q are all false → Not our case.

B: Inconsistent → No, we found a consistent case.

C: Consistent. Valuation when N, O, and P are true and Q is false. Wait, in our case, P is F, so this doesn't match.

D: Inconsistent. ... → No.

E: Consistent. Valuation when N and P are true and O and Q are false. Wait, in our case, N is T, P is F, O is T, Q is F. So, this doesn't match.

F: Inconsistent... → No.

G: Consistent. Valuation when N and O are true and P and Q are false. Wait, in our case, N is T, O is T, P is F, Q is F. So, yes, that matches. So option G says "Consistent. Valuation when N and O are true and P and Q are false."

H: Consistent. Valuation when O, P, Q are true and N is false. No, our valuation has N as T.

So, the correct option is G: Consistent, with N and O true, P and Q false.

The set of propositions is consistent, and a consistent valuation is when N and O are true, and P and Q are false.
