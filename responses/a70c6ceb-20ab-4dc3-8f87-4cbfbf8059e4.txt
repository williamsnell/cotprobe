Okay, so I've got this physics problem about calculating the electric potential energy of a thin spherical conducting shell with radius R and charge q. Hmm, I remember that electric potential energy involves the work done to assemble charges on a conductor. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formulas.

Let me think. For a conducting shell, the charge resides on the surface. Now, when charges are placed on a conductor, the potential energy can be calculated by considering the work done in bringing each infinitesimal charge from infinity to the shell. Since the shell is conducting, the charge distribution is uniform.

I recall that the electric potential energy (U) for a charge distribution can be found using the formula U = (1/2) * Q * V, where Q is the total charge and V is the potential at the surface due to the charge. But wait, does that apply here?

Wait, no, maybe another approach. For a conducting shell, the potential at the surface is given by V = q/(4πε₀R). So if I use the formula U = (1/2) Q V, that would be U = (1/2)(q)(q/(4πε₀R))).

Wait, let's see: U = (1/2) * (q) * (q/(4πε₀ R)) ) = q²/(8πε₀ R). Hmm, but looking at the options, option H is q²/(8πε₀ R). But wait, another thought: am I considering the correct method?

Alternatively, I remember that for a conducting shell, the electric potential energy can also be calculated as U = (q²)/(8πε₀ R). Or wait, maybe it's different. Let me think again about the process.

When building up the charge on the shell, each infinitesimal charge dq is brought from infinity to the shell. The potential at the shell's surface when a charge dq is added is V = (q + dq)/(4πε₀ R). So the work done dU is dq * V. So integrating from 0 to q, U = ∫(from 0 to q) (q' dq')/(4πε₀ R). Wait, but when adding dq', the existing charge is q', so the potential is V = q'/(4πε₀ R). So the work done for each dq' is dq' * (q'/(4πε₀ R)). Therefore, U = ∫(0 to q) (q')/(4πε₀ R) dq' = (1/(4πε₀ R)) ∫(0 to q) q' dq' = (1/(4πε₀ R)) * (q²/2) ) = q²/(8πε₀ R). Oh, so that would make option H correct.

Wait, but I've also heard that the potential energy for a conducting shell is q²/(8πε₀ R). So that matches what I just calculated. So in the options, H is q²/(8πε₀ R). So the answer should be H.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another approach: the potential energy of a charge on a conducting shell can be found by considering the self-energy. For a conducting sphere, the self-energy is (3/5) (q²)/(4πε₀ R). Wait, no, that's for a solid sphere, not a shell. Oh right, for a conducting shell, the charge is on the surface, so the calculation is different. The shell's radius is R, and the potential is q/(4πε₀ R), so the energy should be (1/2) q V = (1/2)(q)(q/(4πε₀ R)) = q²/(8πε₀ R). So yes, that's H.

Looking at the options, H is listed as (q²)/(8πε₀ R) joules. So I think H is the correct answer.

The electric potential energy of a thin spherical conducting shell of radius \( R \) carrying charge \( q \) can be calculated using the formula \( U = \frac{1}{2} q V \), where \( V \) is the electric potential at the surface of the shell. For a conducting shell, the potential at the surface is \( V = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 R} \). Substituting this into the formula for \( U \), we get:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} q \left( \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 R} \right) = \frac{q^2}{8\pi\epsilon_0 R}.
\]

This matches option H. Therefore, the correct answer is:

H
