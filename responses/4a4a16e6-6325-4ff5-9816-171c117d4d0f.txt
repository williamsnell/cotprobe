Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about something called "Magic memory" which has two operations: Read and Clear. Both are indivisible and mutually exclusive. Clear sets it to zero, and Read returns the number of Read operations since the last Clear. The question is asking which statements I, II, III are true about it.

First, let's understand each operation. Read gives the count of Read operations after the last Clear. So, every time Clear is called, the count resets to zero. And since Read and Clear are mutually exclusive and indivisible, they can't be interrupted once started.

Now, looking at the statements:

I. It can provide the functionality of an atomic Test-and-Set.
Hmm, Test-and-Set is a synchronization primitive used in concurrent systems. It typically sets a variable to a certain value if it's in a particular state, and returns the previous value. So, can Magic memory do that?

Wait, Magic memory's Read returns the count of Read operations since last Clear. So if process A does a Read, it gets a number, say 5. Then process B does a Clear, which sets it to zero. Then process A does another Read, it would get 1 (assuming only one Read after Clear). But I'm not sure how this directly relates to Test-and-Set. Test-and-Set usually involves checking a condition and setting a value if the condition is met, like a lock.

Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's move on and come back.

II. It can be used to coordinate processes running on a shared-memory multiprocessor.
Shared-memory multiprocessors use synchronization primitives to coordinate processes. Magic memory's operations are atomic and mutually exclusive, which are essential for synchronization. So yes, it can be used for coordination. So II is probably true.

III. It is only useful on a multiprocessor.
Wait, if it's only useful on a multiprocessor, that might not be right. On a single processor, you have only one process at a time, so mutual exclusion isn't a problem. But Magic memory's Read and Clear are mutually exclusive, which isn't needed in a single processor because there's no concurrency. So maybe III is false because it's also useful in a multiprocessor but perhaps not only there. Or maybe it's not useful on a single processor because the mutual exclusion isn't needed. Hmm, the wording says "only useful on a multiprocessor," which would mean it's not useful elsewhere. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think again. Magic memory allows processes to coordinate by using Read and Clear. So on a single processor, maybe it's not needed, but it's not necessarily only useful on multiprocessors. So statement III says it's only useful on a multiprocessor, which might not be correct because it could have uses elsewhere, or perhaps even in other contexts within a single processor for some form of counting, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the mutual exclusivity is only relevant in a multiprocessor environment, so without concurrency, it's not useful. So perhaps III is true because it's only useful where concurrency exists, i.e., multiprocessors.

Wait, but statement III says "it is only useful on a multiprocessor." So if it's also useful on a single processor, then III is false. But does Magic memory have any use on a single processor? Like, for counting reads without any concurrency issues. But since Read and Clear are atomic, maybe it's not necessary on a single processor. So perhaps it's only useful when multiple processes can access it, hence on a multiprocessor. So III might be true.

Wait, but the question is whether it's only useful on a multiprocessor. So if it's useful elsewhere, then III is false. But if it's not useful elsewhere, then III is true. I'm a bit confused here. Let's think about the options again.

Looking back at the options, the answer choices are from A to J.

If II is true (can be used to coordinate processes on a shared-memory multiprocessor), that makes sense because mutual exclusion is needed there.

What about I? Can it provide Test-and-Set functionality? Let me think. Test-and-Set usually looks at a variable and sets it if it meets a condition. For example, in a lock, it might set a variable to 1 if it's 0, returning the old value. How does Magic memory's Read and Clear compare?

Suppose we have a variable that uses Magic memory. If process A does a Read, it gets a count. Process B does a Clear, resetting it. Then process A does another Read. But how does that act like Test-and-Set?

Alternatively, perhaps using Read to check if it's zero (since after Clear, it's zero). So when a process does Read, if the result is zero, it means no one else has Read since the last Clear. But I'm not sure if that's exactly Test-and-Set. Maybe not. So I'm leaning towards I being false.

So, if I is false, II is true, and III is true or false?

Wait, earlier I thought III might be true because it's only useful in a multiprocessor. But if it's also useful elsewhere, then III is false. Or maybe it's not useful only in a multiprocessor but can be used elsewhere, making III false because it's not only useful there.

Alternatively, perhaps III is false because it can be used in a single processor for counting, but mutual exclusion isn't necessary there. Wait, but in a single processor, the Read and Clear operations would be sequential, so mutual exclusion isn't an issue. So maybe Magic memory isn't useful in a single processor because without concurrency, the mutual exclusion isn't needed, and the counting might not add value. So perhaps it's only useful in a multiprocessor, making III true.

Wait, but the question is whether it's only useful on a multiprocessor. So if it's not useful on a single processor, then III is correct. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe it can be used on a single processor, for example, to count the number of times a Read operation has been performed since the last Clear, but without any concurrency issues. So perhaps it's useful in both cases, making statement III false because it's not only useful on a multiprocessor.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to break it down again.

I: Can Magic memory provide Test-and-Set functionality?

Test-and-Set typically involves an atomic operation where a process checks the value of a variable and, if it meets a condition, sets it to another value. For example, in a lock, a process might try to set a lock variable from 0 to 1, but only if it's 0. The operation returns the old value.

Can Magic memory's Read and Clear do that? Read returns the count of Read operations since the last Clear. Suppose we have a variable M.

When a process wants to perform Test-and-Set, it would do:

old_value = M.TestAndSet(new_value)

In Magic memory, when a process does Read, it gets the count. If it's zero, it could mean that no Read has been done since the last Clear. So maybe a process could Clear the memory if it's zero, but that doesn't directly translate to Test-and-Set.

Alternatively, perhaps using Read to see if the count is zero, and then perform a Clear, but I'm not sure if that's the same as Test-and-Set. It seems more like a way to signal that a Clear is needed, but not exactly the Test-and-Set operation.

So I'm leaning towards statement I being false.

II: It can be used to coordinate processes on a shared-memory multiprocessor. Since the operations are atomic and mutually exclusive, they can be used for synchronization primitives like locks. So II is true.

III: It is only useful on a multiprocessor. If it's not useful on a single processor, then III is true. But if it can be used on a single processor for counting, then III is false. Since Read and Clear are atomic, but in a single processor, mutual exclusion isn't needed because only one process runs at a time. So perhaps Magic memory isn't useful there, making III true.

Wait, but the question says "only useful on a multiprocessor." So if it's also useful elsewhere, then III is false. But if it's not useful elsewhere, then III is true. I'm not entirely sure, but I think Magic memory is mainly useful for concurrency control, so it's primarily used on multiprocessors. So III might be true.

But let me think again. Suppose you have a single processor, and you want to count the number of times a certain event occurs. You could use Read to get the count after each Clear. But since there's no concurrency, mutual exclusion isn't an issue. So perhaps it's still useful for counting, making III false because it's not only useful on multiprocessors.

Alternatively, maybe without the mutual exclusion, the operations aren't as useful for synchronization, but they can still be used for counting. So III would be false because it's also useful on a single processor for counting.

Wait, but the question is whether it's only useful on a multiprocessor. If it's useful elsewhere, then III is false. So if it can be used on a single processor for counting, then III is false.

So putting it together:

I: False
II: True
III: False

Wait, but that would mean only II is true. Looking at the options:

Options are:

A: I only â†’ False
B: II only â†’ True
C: II and III â†’ No, since III is false
D: Only II and III â†’ No
E: I, II and III â†’ No
F: None â†’ No, because II is true
G: All â†’ No
H: I and III â†’ No
I: I and II â†’ No, since I is false
J: III only â†’ No

So the correct answer would be B: II only.

Wait, but earlier I thought III might be true. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, if III says "it is only useful on a multiprocessor," meaning it's not useful on a single processor. But if it's useful on a single processor for counting, then III is false.

Alternatively, maybe in a single processor, the mutual exclusivity isn't needed, so the operations would still function, but perhaps not in the same way. So maybe it's not useful for coordination, but could be used for something else.

Wait, but the question is about whether it's only useful on a multiprocessor. So if it's useful on a single processor, then III is false.

So I think II is true, and I and III are false. So the answer is B: II only.
</think>

The analysis considers the functionality of "Magic memory" with Read and Clear operations, which are atomic and mutually exclusive. Statement I suggests it can provide Test-and-Set functionality, but this seems unlikely as Read and Clear do not directly mimic the Test-and-Set operation. Statement II is true because Magic memory's atomic operations can be used for synchronization in a shared-memory multiprocessor. Statement III claims it is only useful on a multiprocessor, but it could also be used for counting on a single processor, making III false. Thus, only II is true.

Answer: B
