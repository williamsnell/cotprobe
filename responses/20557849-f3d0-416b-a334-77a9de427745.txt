Okay, so I have this question about short-term memory and its limited capacity. I need to figure out the two principal explanations for why it's limited. Let me think.

I remember learning about memory in psychology class. Short-term memory, also known as working memory, has a limited capacity. I think the main ideas are about how much information it can hold and for how long.

One concept I recall is the idea of chunking. Chunking helps increase the amount of information that can be held in short-term memory. For example, remembering a long string of numbers by breaking them into smaller groups or chunks. So that's one factor—chunking helps, but without it, the capacity is limited.

Another thing I remember is the duration. Short-term memory can only hold information for a short period, like a few seconds unless it's actively rehearsed. So the limited duration is another factor. If you don't use rehearsal, the information fades away.

Looking at the options, I need to see which ones match these two points. Let's go through them:

A: Rehearsal and Forgetting – Rehearsal actually helps maintain information, so I'm not sure if this is about the limitation.

B: Sensory Input and Cognitive Load – Sensory input is more about getting information in, and cognitive load has to do with processing, maybe related to working memory.

C: Interference and Time-Decay – Interference could be about other information affecting it, and time-decay is about information fading over time. That sounds relevant.

D: Capacity and Duration – These are two aspects of short-term memory: how much it can hold (capacity) and how long it lasts (duration). That seems to fit.

E: Chunking and Associative Learning – Chunking is about increasing capacity, but associative learning is more about linking info for better recall, not the limitation.

F: Recall and Recognition – These are types of memory retrieval, not the reasons for limited capacity.

G: Attention and Distraction – Attention affects what gets into memory, but distraction is more about losing focus, not the inherent limits.

H: Encoding and Retrieval – These are processes, but not the main reasons for the limits.

I: Working Memory and Long-Term Memory Storage – Working memory is another term for short-term, and long-term storage is different. Maybe not the main points.

J: Serial Position Effect and Primacy/Recency – These are about order and recall, not capacity.

So, option C is about interference and time-decay. Interference could refer to proactive and retroactive interference, which affects how much info can be stored, and time-decay explains the loss over time. Option D is about capacity and duration, which are the two main factors of short-term memory's limitations.

Wait, the question asks for the two principal explanations. So maybe both C and D are relevant. But the options are singular. Let me think again.

The limited capacity is about how much can be held (capacity) and how long it lasts (duration). So D: Capacity and Duration directly address the two main points.

Alternatively, some theories, like the Multi-Store Model, mention that short-term memory has limited capacity and duration, needing rehearsal to move to long-term. So the limitations are capacity and duration.

Another thought: The other option is C, which is about interference (which affects capacity) and time-decay (affects duration). So both C and D are about the same things but framed differently.

Wait, the question is about the explanations for the limited capacity. Capacity is one aspect, and duration is another. So the answer is D: Capacity and Duration. Because those are the two main factors that define the limitations of short-term memory.

Alternatively, some sources might say that the main factors are chunking (which deals with capacity) and duration. But the question is about the limitations, so the explanations for why it's limited would be the capacity (how much it can hold) and the duration (how long it lasts without rehearsal).

So I think the correct answer is D.

The two principal explanations for the limited capacity of short-term memory are its limited duration and its limited capacity. These factors define how much information can be held and for how long. 

Answer: D
