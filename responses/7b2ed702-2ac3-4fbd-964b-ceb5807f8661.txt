Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Doppler effect with a airplane and a sound source. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says an airplane is flying at Mach 0.5 and carries a sound source emitting a 1000-Hz signal. The listener is in the path after the airplane has passed. I need to find out what frequency the listener hears.

First, I remember that the Doppler effect has to do with the change in frequency when a source is moving relative to the observer. There are two main cases: when the source is moving towards the observer and when it's moving away.

Wait, the airplane has passed the listener, so the source is moving away from the observer after passing. So that means the sound waves are being stretched out, which would lower the frequency. That makes sense because when a source is moving away, each successive wavefront is emitted from a position further away, so the wavelength increases, frequency decreases.

The formula for the Doppler effect when the source is moving away is f' = f * (v / (v + vs)), where f is the emitted frequency, v is the speed of sound, and vs is the speed of the source.

But wait, I should double-check the formula. Oh right, when the source is moving away, the denominator is v plus vs. Because the source's speed adds to the speed away from the observer.

Now, the airplane is flying at Mach 0.5. Mach number is the ratio of the object's speed to the speed of sound. So Mach 0.5 means the airplane's speed (vs) is 0.5 times the speed of sound (v). So vs = 0.5v.

Plugging vs into the formula: f' = f * (v / (v + 0.5v)) = f * (v / 1.5v) = f * (1/1.5) = f * (2/3).

So f' is the original frequency divided by 1.5, which is 2/3 of the original. The original frequency is 1000 Hz. So 1000 * (2/3) is approximately 666.67 Hz.

Looking at the options, E is 667 Hz. That's the closest match.

Wait, but wait a second. I should make sure I didn't mix up the direction. When the source is moving away, the observed frequency is lower. So from 1000 Hz, it should be less than that. E is 667, which fits. The other options: A is same, B is half, that would be 500, which would be if vs was v, but here it's 0.5v.

So yeah, E seems correct.

The Doppler effect applies here since the sound source is moving relative to the observer. When the source moves away, the observed frequency decreases. The formula used is \( f' = f \cdot \frac{v}{v + v_s} \), where \( v_s = 0.5v \). Substituting, \( f' = 1000 \cdot \frac{1}{1.5} \approx 667 \) Hz. 

Answer: E
