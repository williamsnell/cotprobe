Okay, so I have this question about symmetric keys in a session. Hmm, I remember that symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. But wait, when is this key used? The question is asking about the last character of the answer, but I think that's a typo; probably just the last part.

Looking at the options, the question is about how long the session symmetric key is used between two parties. Let me think about how sessions work. In a session, two parties agree on a key, right? That key is used for all the communication during that session. So once the session ends, they usually terminate and might generate a new key for the next session.

Option A says "Twice." That doesn't sound right. You wouldn't just use the key twice unless it's a very short session. Option B is "Until one of the parties terminates the session." That makes sense because the session continues until someone ends it. Option C is about a predetermined time, but I don't think sessions are usually based on a fixed time; they end when the session ends. Option D is "Until a new key is generated," which is similar to B because the new key comes when the session restarts. Option E is only when both agree, but the key is used as long as the session is active, not just when they agree. Option F says conditions dependent, which is vague. Option G is for a specific number of transactions, but I think sessions don't usually count transactions like that. Option H is multiple times, but that's also true because the key is used for the entire session, which could involve multiple communications. Option I is until compromised, but that's more about security breaches, not the normal operation. Option J is only once, which would mean the key is used for a single message, but in a session, it's used for all messages until the session ends.

So, the key is used until the session ends. Either until one party terminates it or until both agree to end it. So B and D seem possible. But D says until a new key is generated, which would be when the session is renewed. So in normal operation, the key is used until the session ends, which is when one party terminates it. So I think the correct answer is B.

The correct answer is B: Until one of the parties terminates the session.

Answer: B
