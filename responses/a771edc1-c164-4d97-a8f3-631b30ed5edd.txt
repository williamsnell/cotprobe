Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about the definitions of Anthropoidea, Hominidae, and Hominoidea. I'm a bit rusty on my primate taxonomy, but I'll try to piece it together.

First, I remember that primates are divided into different groups, and there's a lot of hierarchy there with terms like order, family, genus, etc. Let me start by recalling what each term generally refers to.

Anthropoidea: I think this is a suborder of primates. Wait, isn't it the group that includes monkeys, apes, and humans? Or maybe it's more specific. I remember that some sources say Anthropoidea includes monkeys and the apes, but not the prosimians like lemurs. So they're the higher primates, excluding the more basal ones.

Hominidae: This term sounds familiar as a family. Oh right, Hominidae is the family that includes humans and our close relatives like chimpanzees, gorillas, and maybe even the fossil hominins. So Hominidae would be the bipedal, great apes, including humans.

Hominoidea: I think this is a superfamily that includes the great apes and humans. So within Hominoidea, there are different families. Like, Hominidae would be under Hominoidea. So Hominoidea is broader than Hominidae. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me think again. Hominidae is a family, while Hominoidea is a superfamily that includes Hominidae and maybe Hylobatidae (the lesser apes like gibbons). So Hominoidea would include both great apes and lesser apes, and Hominidae is just the great apes and humans.

Looking at the options, let me go through each one.

Option A: Anthropoidea are higher primates excluding apes. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right because I thought Anthropoidea includes apes. So A might be incorrect.

Option B: Anthropoidea are lower primates? I think lower would refer to more primitive, but Anthropoidea are higher. So B is probably wrong.

Option C: Anthropoidea include monkeys and apes as an infraorder. Hmm, I'm not sure about infraorder, but I think Anthropoidea is a suborder. Also, Hominoidea being all primates doesn't seem right because that's too broad. So C might not be correct.

Option D: Anthropoidea are tailed anthropoids. Wait, no, Anthropoidea are tailless, right? Because monkeys and apes usually don't have tails. So D is likely wrong.

Option E: Anthropoidea are broad classification without prehensile tails. That makes sense because monkeys and apes often don't have prehensile tails (like New World monkeys do). Hominoidea as the order of large apesâ€”wait, Hominoidea is a superfamily, not an order. So E might not be correct.

Option F: Anthropoidea as a suborder of all primates. No, because primates are divided into suborders like Prosimii and Anthropoidea. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Anthropoidea as extinct primates. No, they're not extinct; they include modern monkeys and apes. G is wrong.

Option H: Anthropoidea as primitive primates. No, they're higher primates. H is incorrect.

Option I: Anthropoidea as New World monkeys. No, New World monkeys are a different group. I is wrong.

Option J: Anthropoidea as higher primates, Hominoidea as a superfamily of great apes and man. Hominidae as the family of fossil men and modern man. That sounds right. Let me check each part.

Anthropoidea: Higher primates. Yes, because they include monkeys, apes, and humans. So J says that correctly.

Hominoidea: Superfamily of great apes and man. Yes, because Hominoidea includes Hominidae (great apes and humans) and Hylobatidae (gibbons). So that's correct.

Hominidae: Family of fossil men and modern man. Yes, because Hominidae includes the hominins, which are humans and our immediate ancestors.

So the correct answer should be option J.

The correct answer is J. Anthropoidea refers to the higher primates, including monkeys, apes, and humans. Hominoidea is the superfamily that encompasses the great apes and humans, while Hominidae is the family that includes fossil hominins and modern humans.
