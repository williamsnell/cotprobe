Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about John Frere's 1797 discovery. I'm not too familiar with him, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the question is asking what John Frere described as his discovery. The options are from A to J. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: a new type of metal alloy. Hmm, I don't recall Frere being known for metallurgy. Maybe not.

Option B: the earliest written documents. That sounds more like something from a different time, maybe the discovery of old texts or scrolls. Not sure if Frere did that.

Option C: the remains of a massive wooden ship believed to be Noah's Ark. I think Noah's Ark has been a topic of many explorations, but I don't think Frere was involved with that. He was more of an antiquary, I believe.

Option D: animal remains scattered on the surface. That sounds like maybe fossils, but scattered on the surface? Not sure.

Option E: the ruins of an ancient civilization under the sea. Underwater ruins? Maybe, but again, I'm not certain if Frere is associated with that.

Option F: fossils of a previously unknown dinosaur species. Dinosaurs weren't known in his time. The term "dinosaur" was coined later, so Frere wouldn't have discovered that.

Option G: cave paintings depicting ancient hunting scenes. That sounds more like something found in places like France or Spain, like Lascaux. Not sure about Frere.

Option H: human skulls with ape-like features. That might relate to early studies of human evolution, but I think that was later than 1797.

Option I: primitive stone tools excavated at great depth. This rings a bell. I think Frere was involved in early archaeological digs, possibly finding stone tools. He was known for his work in England, maybe at some sites.

Option J: a hidden underground city. That's more like places like Cappadocia in Turkey, which were discovered much later.

Wait, John Frere is known for his work in the early days of archaeology. He was an antiquary and a lawyer, I think. He made important discoveries in England, possibly at sites like Hoxne in Suffolk. He was one of the first to systematically dig for artifacts. His discovery might have been stone tools, which would align with option I.

Another point: the question says he described his discovery. If he found stone tools, that would be a significant find, especially if they were from a prehistoric time. He might have been among the first to recognize them as such.

So, putting it together, I think the answer is I: primitive stone tools excavated at great depth.

The correct answer is I: primitive stone tools excavated at great depth, as John Frere is known for his early archaeological work, including the discovery of stone tools.
