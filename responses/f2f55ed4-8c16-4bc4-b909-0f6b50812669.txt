B: 2 amperes
C: 0.2 ampere
D: 1 ampere
E: 0.25 ampere
F: 3 amperes
G: 0.5 ampere
H: 0.75 ampere
I: 5 amperes
J: 4 amperes

Answer:

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the current through a light bulb's filament. Hmm, let me think. I remember from school that current, voltage, and resistance are related somehow. Oh right, it's Ohm's Law. Ohm's Law says that the current (I) is equal to the voltage (V) divided by the resistance (R). So the formula is I = V/R.

Alright, let me make sure I got that right. So if I have the voltage and the resistance, I can find the current by dividing them. The question gives me a resistance of 240 ohms and a voltage of 120 volts. So plugging those numbers into the formula, I should be able to calculate the current.

Wait, let me double-check the units. Volts are in volts, ohms are in ohms, so the current will be in amperes, which is what the options are giving. Perfect. So 120 volts divided by 240 ohms. Let me do that math: 120 divided by 240. Hmm, 240 goes into 120 half a time, right? So that's 0.5 amperes. 

Looking at the options, option G is 0.5 ampere. So that should be the correct answer. But wait, did I mix up anything? Let me think again. Ohm's Law is straightforward, I think. Voltage over resistance gives current. So yeah, 120/240 is 0.5. That makes sense. So the current should be 0.5 A.

The current through the filament can be found using Ohm's Law: \( I = \frac{V}{R} \). Substituting the given values, \( I = \frac{120\,V}{240\,\Omega} = 0.5\,A \).

Answer: G
