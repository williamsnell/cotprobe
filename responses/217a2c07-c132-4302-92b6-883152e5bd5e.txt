Okay, so I have this question about the kidney's structure, and I need to figure out the right answer. The question is asking which part describes the cluster of blood capillaries found in each nephron. The options are A through J, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I remember that the kidney is made up of many nephrons, which are the functional units. Each nephron has several parts. I'm trying to visualize the parts of a nephron. Let me think about the different structures.

I know that blood enters the nephron through an afferent arteriole. Then, it goes into a structure where it's filtered. Oh right, that's the glomerulus. The glomerulus is a network of tiny blood capillaries. So the cluster of capillaries is the glomerulus. 

Wait, let me make sure. The glomerulus is a ball of capillaries surrounded by Bowman's capsule. Bowman's capsule is the structure that collects the filtrate. So the glomerulus is definitely the cluster of capillaries.

Looking at the options, B is Glomerulus. Let me check the other options to be thorough. Option A is the afferent arteriole, which brings blood into the glomerulus, but it's not the capillary cluster itself. Option C is the renal medulla, which is a part of the kidney's structure, but not specific to the capillaries in the nephron. Option D is the proximal convoluted tubule, which processes the filtrate after it leaves the glomerulus. E is the efferent arteriole, which carries blood away from the glomerulus. F is the loop of Henle, which is part of the tubule that goes deep into the medulla. G is the distal convoluted tubule, another part of the processing after the glomerulus. H is the renal pelvis, which is a collecting area for urine. I is Bowman's capsule, which surrounds the glomerulus but isn't the capillaries. J is the renal capsule, which I think is a layer around the kidney, not part of the nephron.

So putting it all together, the cluster of blood capillaries is the glomerulus, which is option B.

The cluster of blood capillaries found in each nephron is the glomerulus. This structure is responsible for filtering blood. 

Answer: B
