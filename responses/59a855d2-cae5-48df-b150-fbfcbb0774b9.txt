Question:

Alice owned Greyacre, a one-acre piece of property, in fee simple. Alice sold the property to Barbara who moved into the only residence on the land. Barbara neglected to record the deed, and three years later, Alice conveyed the same property to Charlene who immediately filed the deed she received from Alice. Greyacre's jurisdiction has a race-notice statute and a tract index system. If an action is filed for title to the property, the likely outcome would be for

Options:

A: Alice, since her ownership was first in time and she was of record.
B: Barbara, because she was the first to record her deed.
C: Alice, since she made two valid sales of the same property.
D: Charlene, because she was the first to record her deed.
E: Barbara, due to her physical possession of the property.
F: Barbara, because Charlene had notice of the prior conveyance between Alice and Barbara.
G: Charlene, because she relied on Alice's representation of ownership.
H: Alice, as she never actually transferred the property rights.
I: Charlene, as Barbara did not officially record her deed.
J: Charlene, because she was the last to receive the deed from Alice.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out this property law question. Okay, so let's break it down step by step.

First, the facts: Alice owns Greyacre, a one-acre property, in fee simple. So she owns it completely. Then she sells it to Barbara, who moves into the residence there. But Barbara doesn't record the deed. Three years later, Alice sells the same property to Charlene, who immediately files her deed. The jurisdiction has a race-notice statute and a tract index system. The question is about who would prevail in an action for title.

I remember that recording statutes are all about notice and priority of claims. There are different types of recording statutes: notice, race, race-notice, and pure notice. Here, it's a race-notice statute. So under race-notice, a subsequent bona fide purchaser (BFP) who records first in time and without notice of prior claims will have priority.

Wait, but in this case, Alice sold to Barbara first, but Barbara didn't record. Then Alice sold to Charlene, who did record immediately. So the key is whether Charlene had notice of Barbara's prior claim when she bought from Alice.

The jurisdiction uses a tract index system, which means that when recording, you search by the specific property (tract). So if Barbara didn't record, then when Charlene went to record, she would have checked the tract index for Greyacre. If Barbara's deed wasn't recorded, Charlene wouldn't have found any prior claims. So she had no notice of Barbara's prior deed.

Under a race-notice statute, the first to record without notice prevails. So Charlene recorded first after Alice, and she didn't have notice of Barbara's prior claim because Barbara didn't record. So Charlene's deed would take priority over Barbara's.

Wait, but wait. Alice sold to both Barbara and Charlene. So Alice can't legally sell the same property twice. But for recording purposes, the issue is about who takes the property. If Barbara didn't record, and then Charlene records, does that mean Charlene is a BFP?

Yes, because Charlene didn't have notice of Barbara's prior claim when she bought from Alice. So under race-notice, she would be protected because she was first to record and without notice.

So the options: looking at the options, D is "Charlene, because she was the first to record her deed." But wait, no, because race-notice requires both recording first and having no notice. So Charlene meets both. So Option D says she was first to record, which is correct, but also because she had no notice.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option I: "Charlene, as Barbara did not officially record her deed." Hmm, that's another way to think about it. Because if Barbara didn't record, then Charlene didn't have notice. So Charlene's recording without notice would prevail.

Option F: "Barbara, because Charlene had notice of the prior conveyance between Alice and Barbara." But if Barbara didn't record, then Charlene didn't have notice. So F is incorrect.

Option D is about being first to record, but under race-notice, it's both race and notice. So D might not capture that. Wait, looking back at the options:

Option I says Charlene because Barbara didn't record. That seems to align with the reasoning that since Barbara didn't record, Charlene had no notice and thus prevails.

Wait, but the key is that under race-notice, the first to record without notice takes priority. So Charlene recorded first and had no notice, so she wins. So I think the correct answer is D or I.

Wait, looking at the options:

D: Charlene, because she was the first to record her deed.

I: Charlene, as Barbara did not officially record her deed.

Hmm. The race-notice statute requires both that the subsequent purchaser records first and that they did so without notice. So in this case, Charlene recorded first, but also, she had no notice because Barbara didn't record. So both conditions are met.

But looking at the options, D says she was first to record. I says Barbara didn't record. So which is the correct reasoning?

The likely outcome is that Charlene wins because she was a BFP who recorded first without notice. So the reason would be that she had no notice because Barbara didn't record. So the correct answer is I, because Barbara didn't record, so Charlene had no notice.

Wait, but the race-notice statute requires both recording first and no notice. So in this case, Charlene recorded first (so she beats Barbara in the race) and had no notice because Barbara didn't record. So both conditions are met, making her the rightful owner.

So the options are D and I. Which one is correct?

Option D: because she was first to record.

Option I: as Barbara did not record.

But the key is that under race-notice, both conditions must be met. So the reason is that she was first to record AND without notice. So perhaps the correct answer is I, because Barbara's failure to record means Charlene had no notice, so she wins.

Alternatively, D is correct because Charlene recorded first, but without the notice part, it's incomplete.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option D: Charlene, because she was the first to record her deed.

Option I: Charlene, as Barbara did not officially record her deed.

So which is the correct reasoning? The statute requires both race and notice. So the reason is that Charlene was first to record AND she had no notice because Barbara didn't record. So the correct answer should include both, but the options don't have that.

Hmm. So perhaps the best answer is I, because Barbara's failure to record means Charlene had no notice, so she wins. Alternatively, D is correct because she recorded first, but without the notice part, it's not complete.

Wait, but in a race-notice state, a subsequent purchaser who records first in time and without notice takes priority. So in this case, Charlene recorded after Alice, but before Barbara, but Barbara didn't record. So when Charlene took her deed, she had no notice because Barbara's deed wasn't recorded.

So the key is that since Barbara didn't record, Charlene had no notice, so she is protected. So the correct answer is I: Charlene, as Barbara did not officially record her deed.

Wait, but I think the correct answer is D because Charlene was the first to record, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Under race-notice, the subsequent purchaser who (1) records first and (2) without notice of prior conveyances takes priority. So in this case:

- Alice sold to Barbara first, but Barbara didn't record.

- Then Alice sold to Charlene, who recorded immediately.

So when Charlene recorded, she checked the tract index, but Barbara's deed wasn't there because she didn't record. So Charlene had no notice. Therefore, she meets both conditions: she recorded first (after Alice), and she had no notice.

So the correct answer is D: Charlene, because she was the first to record her deed.

Wait, but the reason she had no notice is because Barbara didn't record. So maybe the answer is I.

But I think the better answer is D, because it's about being first to record. The notice part is a separate condition, but the option D doesn't mention it. However, the correct reasoning is that Charlene was first to record without notice.

But in the options, the only one that combines both is perhaps not present. So perhaps the best answer is I, because Barbara didn't record, so Charlene had no notice. Alternatively, D because she recorded first.

I think the answer is I: Charlene, as Barbara did not officially record her deed.

The question revolves around property law under a race-notice recording statute, where the priority of ownership depends on both the recording of a deed and the absence of notice of prior claims. Alice initially sold Greyacre to Barbara, who failed to record the deed. Three years later, Alice sold the same property to Charlene, who immediately recorded her deed. The jurisdiction uses a tract index system, meaning Charlene would have searched the records and found no prior claims if Barbara's deed was not recorded.

Under a race-notice statute, a subsequent bona fide purchaser (BFP) who records first and without notice of prior claims prevails. In this case, Barbara's failure to record means Charlene had no notice of her prior claim when she recorded. Charlene's recording without notice establishes her as the rightful owner, as she meets both conditions of the race-notice statute. While option D highlights Charlene's status as the first to record, the reasoning primarily hinges on Barbara's failure to record, which eliminated Charlene's notice of prior claims.
