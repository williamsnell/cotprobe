Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the possible values of g(2023), and g(x) is the horizontal asymptote of the function f(x) = (3^x)/(1 + 3^{-x}). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that a horizontal asymptote is a y-value that the function approaches as x goes to positive or negative infinity. So, I guess I need to find the horizontal asymptote of f(x) first because g(x) is that asymptote.

Looking at f(x), it's (3^x) divided by (1 + 3^{-x}). Let me rewrite 3^{-x} as 1/(3^x). So the denominator becomes 1 + 1/(3^x). That might make it easier to analyze.

So f(x) = 3^x / (1 + 1/(3^x)). To find the horizontal asymptote, I should consider the behavior as x approaches infinity and as x approaches negative infinity.

Let me first consider the case when x approaches positive infinity. As x becomes very large, 3^x grows exponentially. In the denominator, 1/(3^x) becomes very small because it's 1 over a huge number. So the denominator is approximately 1 + 0 = 1. Therefore, f(x) ≈ 3^x / 1, which is just 3^x. As x approaches infinity, 3^x also approaches infinity. So one horizontal asymptote is at y = infinity, but wait, horizontal asymptotes are finite y-values or maybe negative infinity. Hmm, but sometimes functions can have different asymptotes from the left and right.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. When x approaches positive infinity, 3^x is huge, so the denominator is 1 + (something very small). So denominator ≈1, and f(x) ≈3^x, which goes to infinity. So that suggests that as x approaches infinity, f(x) approaches infinity, so no horizontal asymptote there, unless I'm missing something.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider the function differently. Maybe I can manipulate it to make it easier to find the asymptote. Let me try multiplying numerator and denominator by 3^x to eliminate the negative exponent.

So f(x) = (3^x) / (1 + 3^{-x}) = [3^x * 3^x] / [ (1 + 3^{-x}) * 3^x ) ].

Wait, that's f(x) = (3^{2x}) / (3^x + 1). Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, let me consider the behavior as x approaches infinity and negative infinity.

When x approaches positive infinity:

- 3^x approaches infinity.

- 3^{-x} approaches 0.

So f(x) = (infinite) / (1 + 0) = infinity. So no horizontal asymptote here; it goes to infinity.

When x approaches negative infinity:

- 3^x approaches 0 because 3^{-infty} = 0.

- 3^{-x} becomes 3^{+infty} which is infinity.

So denominator is 1 + infinity = infinity.

So f(x) = 0 / infinity = 0. So as x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches 0. So the horizontal asymptote is y=0 from the left side.

Wait, but the question says g(x) is the horizontal asymptote. So does that mean g(x) is a function or a constant? Wait, horizontal asymptotes are typically constant functions, so g(x) should be a constant. So if as x approaches infinity, f(x) approaches infinity, and as x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches 0, then the horizontal asymptote is y=0.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says g(x) is the horizontal asymptote. So maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps g(x) is a function that represents the asymptote, but for f(x), there are two different behaviors as x approaches positive and negative infinity. So the horizontal asymptotes are y=0 and y=+infinity? But that doesn't make sense because y=+infinity isn't a horizontal line; it's more like the function goes to infinity, not approaching a finite value.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. Let me rewrite f(x) in a different form. Let me set y = f(x) = 3^x / (1 + 3^{-x}).

Let me multiply numerator and denominator by 3^x to eliminate the negative exponent.

So y = [3^x * 3^x] / [ (1 + 3^{-x}) * 3^x ] = (3^{2x}) / (3^x + 1).

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, let me express 3^{-x} as 1/(3^x), so:

y = 3^x / (1 + 1/(3^x)).

Let me let t = 3^x. Then as x approaches infinity, t approaches infinity, and as x approaches -infinity, t approaches 0.

So substituting, y = t / (1 + 1/t) = t / ( (t + 1)/t ) = t^2 / (t + 1).

So now y = t^2 / (t + 1). Let's analyze this as t approaches infinity and t approaches 0.

As t approaches infinity, y = t^2 / (t + 1) ≈ t^2 / t = t, which approaches infinity. So as t→infty, y→infty.

As t approaches 0, y = (0)^2 / (0 + 1) = 0. So as t→0, y→0.

So the function y approaches 0 as t approaches 0 (which is when x approaches -infty) and approaches infinity as t approaches infinity (x approaches +infty).

So the only horizontal asymptote is y=0 because that's the only finite value the function approaches as x approaches negative infinity.

Wait, but the problem says g(x) is the horizontal asymptote. So maybe g(x) is 0, so g(2023) would be 0. But looking at the options, J is 0.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in my substitution.

Wait, let me try another approach. Let me set t = 3^{-x}, so when x approaches infinity, t approaches 0, and when x approaches negative infinity, t approaches infinity.

So f(x) = 3^x / (1 + t) = (1/t) / (1 + t) = 1/(t(1 + t)).

Hmm, as t approaches 0 (x approaches infinity), 1/(t(1 + t)) approaches infinity.

As t approaches infinity (x approaches negative infinity), 1/(t(1 + t)) approaches 0.

So again, the function approaches 0 as x approaches negative infinity and approaches infinity as x approaches positive infinity. So the only horizontal asymptote is y=0.

So g(x) is y=0, so g(2023) would be 0. So the answer is J.

To determine the possible values of \( g(2023) \), where \( g(x) \) is the horizontal asymptote of \( f(x) = \frac{3^x}{1 + 3^{-x}} \), we analyze the behavior of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches positive and negative infinity.

1. **As \( x \to \infty \):**
   - \( 3^x \) grows exponentially to infinity.
   - \( 3^{-x} \) approaches 0.
   - The denominator \( 1 + 3^{-x} \) approaches 1.
   - Thus, \( f(x) \approx \frac{3^x}{1} \), which grows without bound. Therefore, \( f(x) \to \infty \).

2. **As \( x \to -\infty \):**
   - \( 3^x \) approaches 0.
   - \( 3^{-x} \) grows exponentially to infinity.
   - The denominator \( 1 + 3^{-x} \) approaches infinity.
   - Thus, \( f(x) \approx \frac{0}{\infty} \), which approaches 0. Therefore, \( f(x) \to 0 \).

From this analysis, the only horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \) as \( x \to -\infty \). Since \( g(x) \) represents this asymptote, \( g(x) = 0 \) for all \( x \). Therefore, \( g(2023) = 0 \).
