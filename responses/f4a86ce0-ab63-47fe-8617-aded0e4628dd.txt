Okay, so I need to figure out West's Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) preference items based on the information given. Let me start by recalling what I know about AMT and preference items.

First, AMT is an alternative tax system in the U.S. that some individuals have to pay in addition to their regular income tax. It's designed to ensure that people with certain types of income don't pay too little in taxes. Preference items are specific types of income that are treated differently for AMT purposes.

Looking at the data provided:

- Long-term capital gain: $15,000
- Percentage depletion in excess of property's adjusted basis: $9,000
- Dividends from publicly-held companies: $10,000

Now, I need to determine which of these are considered AMT preference items.

I remember that for AMT, long-term capital gains are treated differently. Specifically, under AMT, long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate, but they are also considered a preference item. Wait, no, actually, no—wait. I think that for AMT, the treatment of capital gains is a bit different. Let me think. Under regular tax, long-term capital gains have a lower rate, but for AMT, they are taxed at the same rate as ordinary income. However, for AMT, certain items are added back, which are called preference items.

So, in terms of AMT, I think that long-term capital gains are included in taxable income for AMT purposes, but they are not a preference item. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up. Let me clarify: AMT has its own set of taxable income, and certain items are added back, which are known as preference items. So, for example, if an item is excluded from regular taxable income but included in AMT, that's a preference item.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each item:

1. Long-term capital gains: Under regular tax, they are taxed at lower rates. For AMT, I believe that long-term capital gains are taxed at the same rate as regular income. So, they are included in AMT taxable income, but I'm not sure if they're considered a preference item. Alternatively, maybe they aren't a preference item but just taxed differently.

Wait, no, I think that the treatment is that for AMT, certain items that are excluded under regular tax are included, making them preference items. For example, if an item is excluded from regular income but included in AMT, that's a preference. But long-term capital gains are included in regular income. So maybe they aren't a preference item but are taxed at a different rate under AMT.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The main point is to identify the items that are considered preference items for AMT. So, the options given are the three items listed.

I recall that percentage depletion in excess of basis is a preference item. Depletion is an allowance to offset the cost of natural resource extraction, but if it exceeds the adjusted basis, the excess is considered a preference item for AMT. So, $9,000 here would count towards the AMT preference items.

Dividends from publicly held companies: Under regular tax, qualified dividends are taxed at the lower capital gains rate. However, under AMT, these dividends are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Additionally, for AMT, the exclusion of dividends (i.e., treating them as taxable) is a preference item. Wait, no, perhaps it's the inclusion of dividends in AMT that's the preference. Wait, no, actually, the fact that dividends are treated more favorably under regular tax but not under AMT makes them a preference item. So, the amount of dividends would be added back as a preference item for AMT. So, the $10,000 in dividends is a preference item.

Wait, but I'm not certain about the exact treatment. Let me think. The AMT has a list of items that are considered preference items, which are added to taxable income for AMT purposes. These include:

- Tax-exempt interest from private activity bonds (but that's not here)
- Incentive stock options
- Long-term capital gains (but wait, I thought that's not a preference item; maybe it's taxed differently)
- Dividends received from U.S. corporations (but in this case, the dividends are from publicly held companies, which I think are considered qualified dividends under regular tax)
- Percentage depletion in excess of basis (as I thought before)

Wait, let me check the list of AMT preference items:

The main preference items include:

1. Tax-exempt interest from certain bonds is included in AMT income.
2. Long-term capital gains are included in AMT income but at regular rates, not as a preference. Wait, no, I think that long-term capital gains are taxed differently but are not a preference item. Instead, the difference in treatment is accounted for by adding back the difference between the lower regular tax rate and the higher AMT rate.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach.

The question is asking for the total AMT preference items. So, I need to sum up each of the items that qualify as preference items.

Looking at each item:

- Long-term capital gain: Is this a preference item? I think not. Because under regular tax, it's taxed at a lower rate, but for AMT, it's taxed at the regular rate, so the difference is accounted for by the tax calculation, but it's not a preference item. So, maybe this doesn't count towards the preference items.

- Percentage depletion in excess of basis: This is a preference item. So, $9,000 counts.

- Dividends from publicly held companies: If these are qualified dividends under regular tax (i.e., taxed at the lower rate), then for AMT, they are taxed at the higher rate. But are these dividends considered a preference item? I believe they are, because under regular tax, they are excluded from taxable income (or taxed at a lower rate), but for AMT, they are included at higher rates. So, the entire amount of dividends would be a preference item. So, $10,000 counts.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the treatment of dividends as preference items. Let me think: The AMT requires that certain items be added to taxable income, which are the preference items. So, for example, if under regular tax, an item is excluded but included under AMT, it's a preference.

Dividends from U.S. corporations are generally included in regular taxable income, but if they're qualified, they're taxed at lower rates. However, for AMT, all dividends are taxed at the same rate as regular income. So, if the dividends are from a U.S. company, they might be considered a preference item because under regular tax, they're taxed more favorably. Alternatively, perhaps only unqualified dividends are considered preference items.

Wait, no, I think that for AMT, all dividends received from publicly held companies (which are considered qualified) are included as preference items. So, the $10,000 would be a preference item.

Alternatively, I might be mixing up the treatment. Let me try to recall: The main AMT preference items include:

1. Long-term capital gains and losses (but I think they are treated differently, not added as preference items)
2. Incentive stock options
3. Percentage depletion
4. Intangible drilling costs
5. Foreign oil and gas extraction income
6. Minimum tax credit
7. Tax-exempt state and local bonds (private activity bonds)
8. Unrecaptured IRC 1202 gains
9. Other items like certain exclusions.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me focus on the items given.

West's items:

- Long-term capital gains: $15k
- Percentage depletion excess: $9k
- Dividends: $10k

I think that percentage depletion in excess is a preference item, so $9k counts.

As for dividends, if they are qualified dividends, then under AMT, the preferential treatment is disallowed, so the amount is added as a preference item. So, $10k would count.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Let me think: Under regular tax, qualified dividends are taxed at lower rates, but for AMT, they are taxed at higher rates. So, the difference in treatment is accounted for by adding them as a preference item in the AMT calculation. So, yes, the $10k would be added as a preference item.

Long-term capital gains, on the other hand, are included in regular taxable income but are taxed at a lower rate. For AMT, they are included but taxed at the higher rate, so the difference is accounted for by adding them to the preference items. Or wait, no, perhaps not. Maybe long-term capital gains are included in AMT income, but they are taxed at the same rate as regular income, so they are not a preference item. Instead, the difference comes from the fact that under regular tax, they are taxed at a lower rate, so the AMT would effectively treat them as regular income, leading to a higher tax.

Wait, perhaps the long-term capital gains are not a preference item but are simply taxed differently. So, in that case, they wouldn't be added as a preference item but would instead be taxed at the higher AMT rate, which would increase the tax liability.

So, in that case, the preference items would be the percentage depletion and the dividends.

So, $9k + $10k = $19k.

But looking at the options, H is $19,000. So, that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. The percentage depletion in excess is a preference item, so that's $9k. The dividends from publicly held companies: If they are considered a preference item, that's $10k. So total is $19k, which is option H.

Alternatively, if the long-term capital gains are a preference item, then the total would be $15k + $9k + $10k = $34k, but that's not an option here. The options include H:19k and I:34k. But I think long-term capital gains are not a preference item, but they are taxed differently under AMT.

Wait, another angle: AMT preference items are those that are excluded from regular taxable income but included in AMT. So, for example, if under regular tax, an item isn't taxed, but under AMT, it is, then it's a preference item.

So, long-term capital gains are included in regular taxable income, so they are not excluded. Therefore, they are not a preference item for AMT. So, only the percentage depletion and dividends would count.

But wait, are dividends considered a preference item? Let me think. Under regular tax, qualified dividends are taxed at lower rates, so for AMT, they are treated as regular income, which is a higher rate. So, the fact that they are taxed more under AMT would mean they are a preference item. So, yes, the $10k would be added.

So, total preference items = 9k +10k =19k → option H.

Alternatively, I might be making a mistake because I'm not sure if dividends are considered a preference item. Let me think again. I've read that for AMT, certain items are added back as preference items if they are excluded under regular tax. Dividends are included in regular taxable income, so perhaps they are not a preference item.

Wait, no, I think that's incorrect. Let me think: If under regular tax, dividends are taxed at a lower rate, but under AMT, they are taxed at the higher rate. So, the difference in treatment is captured by including them as a preference item. Therefore, the entire amount of dividends would be added as a preference item.

So, in that case, the total preference items would be 9k +10k =19k, which is option H.

Alternatively, I might be confusing this with something else. Let me try to recall the IRS instructions or some examples.

I think that percentage depletion in excess of basis is definitely a preference item. As for dividends, I believe that they are considered a preference item for AMT purposes because they're treated more favorably under regular tax.

So, adding 9k and10k gives 19k, which is option H.

To determine West's AMT tax preference items, we analyze each of the provided items based on their treatment under the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT):

1. **Long-term capital gain ($15,000):**  
   Long-term capital gains are included in regular taxable income but taxed at a lower rate under regular tax. For AMT, they are taxed at the same rate as ordinary income, but they are not considered a preference item. Therefore, this amount does not qualify as a preference item for AMT.

2. **Percentage depletion in excess of property's adjusted basis ($9,000):**  
   Percentage depletion in excess of the property's adjusted basis is explicitly considered a preference item for AMT. Thus, this amount qualifies as a preference item.

3. **Dividends from publicly held companies ($10,000):**  
   Under regular tax, qualified dividends are taxed at a lower rate. For AMT, these dividends are taxed at the same rate as ordinary income, making them a preference item because their treatment is less favorable under AMT. Therefore, this amount also qualifies as a preference item.

Summing the preference items:  
$9,000 (percentage depletion) + $10,000 (dividends) = **$19,000**.

Thus, the total amount of West's AMT tax preference items is **$19,000**, corresponding to option **H**.

**Answer:** H
