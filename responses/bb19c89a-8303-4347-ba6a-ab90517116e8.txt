Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that lithium oxide (Li₂O) reacts with water (H₂O) to produce lithium hydroxide (LiOH). The reaction given is Li₂O + H₂O → 2LiOH. They're asking how much mass of Li₂O is needed to completely react with 24 liters of H₂O. The options are from A to J, with various kilograms.

Hmm, first, I think I need to write down the balanced chemical equation to get the mole ratios right. Wait, the reaction is already given as Li₂O + H₂O → 2LiOH. Let me check if it's balanced. Li on the left: 2 from Li₂O. On the right, 2 from 2LiOH. So that's balanced. O: 1 from Li₂O, 1 from H₂O, and 2*(OH) would give 2 O in LiOH, but wait, that's 2 O in 2 LiOH, so that's 2 O. So total O on the left is 1 (Li₂O) + 1 (H₂O) = 2. On the right, 2 LiOH has 2 O. So yes, it's balanced. Okay, so the mole ratio is 1 mole Li₂O to 1 mole H₂O.

Next, I need to find out how many moles of H₂O are in 24 liters. But wait, the density of water is given as 1.0 g/cm³, which is 1 g per mL. So 1 liter is 1000 mL, so 24 liters is 24,000 mL, which equals 24,000 grams because density is 1 g/mL. Wait, is that right? Yes, because mass = volume × density, and here volume is 24 liters which is 24,000 mL, so mass is 24,000 mL × 1 g/mL = 24,000 grams.

Now, the molecular weight of H₂O is 18 g/mol. So the number of moles of H₂O is mass divided by molecular weight. So 24,000 g / 18 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 24,000 divided by 18. Hmm, 24,000 ÷ 18. Well, 18 × 1333 = 23,994, which is close to 24,000. So approximately 1333.33 moles of H₂O.

Since the reaction ratio is 1:1 between Li₂O and H₂O, the moles of Li₂O needed would be the same as H₂O. So 1333.33 moles of Li₂O.

Now, the molecular weight of Li₂O is given as 30 g/mol. So mass of Li₂O is moles × molar mass. So 1333.33 mol × 30 g/mol. Let's calculate that. 1333.33 × 30. Well, 1333 × 30 is 39,990, and 0.33 ×30 is about 10, so total is 40,000 grams. Wait, 40,000 grams is 40 kg. Looking at the options, option F is 40 kg. So that's the answer.

The reaction is balanced, with a 1:1 mole ratio between Li₂O and H₂O. Given 24 liters of H₂O, its mass is 24,000 grams. Using the molecular weight of H₂O (18 g/mol), the moles of H₂O are approximately 1333.33. Since Li₂O reacts in a 1:1 ratio, 1333.33 moles of Li₂O are needed. With a molecular weight of 30 g/mol, the mass of Li₂O is 40,000 grams or 40 kg.

Answer: F
