Okay, so I have this question about portfolio standard deviation. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll do my best.

The question says that Stocks A and B have standard deviations of 6% and 18%, respectively. Their correlation is 0.2, and the portfolio is equally weighted. I need to find the portfolio's standard deviation.

First, I remember that the formula for the standard deviation of a two-asset portfolio is a bit more complicated than just taking the average because it involves the correlation between the two assets. The formula I think is something like:

Portfolio Variance = (w_A² * σ_A²) + (w_B² * σ_B²) + (2 * w_A * w_B * ρ_AB * σ_A * σ_B)

Since it's an equal-weighted portfolio, each weight (w_A and w_B) should be 0.5, right? Because you split the investment equally between the two stocks.

So plugging in the numbers:

w_A = 0.5, w_B = 0.5
σ_A = 6%, σ_B = 18%
ρ_AB = 0.2

Now, let's compute each part.

First part: w_A squared times σ_A squared. That's (0.5)^2 * (6)^2. 0.5 squared is 0.25. 6 squared is 36. So 0.25 * 36 = 9.

Second part: w_B squared times σ_B squared. (0.5)^2 * 18^2. 0.25 * 324 = 81.

Third part: 2 * w_A * w_B * ρ_AB * σ_A * σ_B. Let's break that down.

2 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.5. Then multiply by 0.2 (correlation) and then by 6 and 18.

So 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1. Then 0.1 * 6 = 0.6, and 0.6 * 18 = 10.8. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. Wait, the formula is 2*w_A*w_B*ρ*σ_A*σ_B. So 2 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.5. Then 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1. Then 0.1 * 6 * 18. 6*18 is 108. 0.1 * 108 = 10.8. So the third term is 10.8.

Now, sum all three parts: 9 (from first part) + 81 (second part) + 10.8 (third part). So 9 + 81 is 90, plus 10.8 is 100.8. So the variance is 100.8.

Wait, but standard deviation is the square root of variance. So sqrt(100.8) is what? Let me calculate that. The square root of 100 is 10, and 100.8 is a bit more. Let me use a calculator in my mind. Hmm, 10^2 is 100, 10.04^2 is 100.8016. Oh, so sqrt(100.8) is approximately 10.04%. So the standard deviation is around 10.04%.

Looking at the options, option F is 10%, which is the closest. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, when I calculated the third term, I think I might have messed up the order. Let's go through it again. The third term is 2 * w_A * w_B * ρ * σ_A * σ_B. So that's 2 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.2 * 6 * 18.

Let me compute step by step:

2 * 0.5 = 1.

1 * 0.5 = 0.5.

0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1.

0.1 * 6 = 0.6.

0.6 * 18 = 10.8. So yes, that's correct. So the third term is indeed 10.8.

So variance = 9 + 81 + 10.8 = 100.8. Square root is about 10.04%. So the answer should be approximately 10%, which is option F.

Wait, but let me think again about the formula. Sometimes I get confused between variance and standard deviation. The formula I used is correct for variance, and then taking the square root gives the standard deviation. So yes, that's right.

Alternatively, maybe I should check if I did the math correctly. Let me compute each part again.

w_A² σ_A² = (0.5)^2 * 6^2 = 0.25 * 36 = 9.

w_B² σ_B² = (0.5)^2 * 18^2 = 0.25 * 324 = 81.

2 w_A w_B ρ σ_A σ_B = 2 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.2 * 6 * 18.

2 * 0.5 is 1, times 0.5 is 0.5, times 0.2 is 0.1. 0.1 * 6 is 0.6, times 18 is 10.8.

So sum is 9 + 81 + 10.8 = 100.8. So variance is 100.8, standard deviation is sqrt(100.8) ≈ 10.04%, so F:10% is the closest.
