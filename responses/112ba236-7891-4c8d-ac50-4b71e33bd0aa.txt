Okay, so I've got this question about Brittany's behavior after using address stickers from a charity. The question is asking which psychological concept this illustrates. Let me think through each option to figure out the correct answer.

First, the scenario: Brittany used address stickers from a charity and then felt obligated to donate. So the key here is that she felt an obligation after receiving something from the charity. That sounds like a social norm where you feel the need to reciprocate. 

Looking at the options:

A: Stereotyping is about generalizing about groups, which doesn't fit here.

B: Reciprocity norm. This is about feeling obliged to return favors. So when someone does something for you, you feel the need to do something back. That fits because the charity sent her stickers, and she felt the need to donate.

C: Halo effect is when you assume one positive trait implies others, not really about obligation.

D: Bystander effect is about people not helping in emergencies when others are around, not related.

E: Door-in-the-face technique is a persuasion tactic where you start with a big request and then offer a smaller one. Not sure if that's what's happening here.

F: Cognitive dissonance is about conflicting thoughts leading to behavior change. Maybe she felt discomfort and donated to reduce it, but I'm not sure if that's the main point here.

G: Just-world phenomenon is the belief that the world is fair, people get what they deserve. Not directly related to the action of donating after receiving something.

H: Self-serving bias is about interpreting events to favor oneself. Doesn't fit here.

I: Fundamental attribution error is about overemphasizing personal traits over situational factors. Not relevant.

J: Mere exposure effect is about liking something more because you've been exposed to it. Not applicable here.

So the main point is Brittany felt she had to donate because she received something, which is the reciprocity norm. Therefore, the answer should be B.

The correct answer is B: the reciprocity norm.

Brittany's behavior reflects the reciprocity norm, where she felt obligated to donate after receiving something from the charity.

Answer: B
