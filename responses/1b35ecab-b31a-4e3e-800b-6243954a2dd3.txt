Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about finding the mass of a single carbon-12 atom given that its atomic weight is exactly 12 amu. The options are from A to J, so I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that atomic weight is related to the mass of an atom. But wait, atomic weight is usually an average based on the isotopes, right? Oh, but the question says carbon-12 specifically, so it's just that isotope. So the atomic weight here is exactly 12 amu.

I think I need to convert atomic mass units (amu) to grams. I recall that 1 amu is approximately equal to 1.66053906660 × 10^-27 kilograms. But wait, I need to make sure I'm converting to grams. Oh right, since 1 kg is 1000 grams, so 1 amu in grams would be 1.66053906660 × 10^-30 grams.

Wait, no, wait. Let me check that again. Because 1 amu is 1.66053906660 × 10^-27 kg. To convert to grams, I multiply by 10^-3, so that's 1.66053906660 × 10^-30 grams per amu.

But wait, I think I might have messed up the exponent. Let me think: 1e-27 kg is the same as 1e-24 grams because 1 kg is 1e3 grams. Oh wait no, wait. 1 kg = 1e3 grams, so 1e-27 kg = 1e-27 * 1e3 grams = 1e-24 grams. Oh right, that's correct. So 1 amu is 1.6605e-24 grams.

Wait, wait, no. Let me get this straight. 1 kg = 1000 grams. So 1e-27 kg is 1e-27 * 1000 grams. 1e-27 * 1e3 = 1e-24 grams. So yes, 1 amu is 1.6605e-24 grams.

So now, each carbon-12 atom has a mass of 12 amu. So the mass in grams would be 12 * 1.6605e-24 g.

Let me calculate that. 12 multiplied by 1.6605e-24. Let's compute 12 * 1.6605 first. 12 times 1.6605 is... Let's see: 1.6605 * 10 is 16.605, and 1.6605 * 2 is 3.321, so total is 19.926. So 12 * 1.6605e-24 = 19.926e-24 g.

Wait, but 19.926e-24 is the same as 1.9926e-23 grams. Hmm, looking at the options, I see option E is 2.7e-23, and option B is 1.2e-23, H is 1.8e-23, etc. Wait, but my calculation gives approximately 2.0e-23 grams. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option I is 2.5e-23, and option E is 2.7e-23. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 19.926e-24 is 1.9926e-23 grams, which is approximately 2.0e-23 grams. So looking at the options, option C is 2.0e-23 g, option E is 2.7e-23, and option I is 2.5e-23.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check. 12 * 1.6605e-24 = 12 * 1.6605 = 19.926, so 19.926e-24 = 1.9926e-23 grams, which is roughly 2.0e-23 g. So option C is 2.0e-23, which is option C.

Wait, but let me think again. I might have gotten the conversion wrong. Another approach: Avogadro's number comes into play here. The molar mass is 12 g/mol for carbon-12, right? So one mole of carbon-12 atoms has a mass of 12 grams. Avogadro's number is approximately 6.022e23 atoms per mole.

So the mass of one atom would be 12 g/mol divided by 6.022e23 atoms/mol. Let's compute that: 12 / 6.022e23 = approximately 1.992e-23 grams per atom. So that's about 2.0e-23 grams, which matches what I calculated earlier. So the correct answer should be option C: 2.0 × 10^-23 g/atom.

Wait, looking back at the options, yes, option C is 2.0e-23. So that's the correct choice.

To determine the mass of a single carbon-12 atom, we start by noting that its atomic weight is 12 amu. Since 1 amu is approximately \(1.6605 \times 10^{-24}\) grams, the mass of one carbon-12 atom is:

\[
12 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{g} = 1.9926 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{g}.
\]

This value is approximately \(2.0 \times 10^{-23}\) grams per atom. Comparing this to the provided options, the correct choice is:

C: \(2.0 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{g/atom}\).
