Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Cavendish balance, and I'm a bit rusty on the details, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem states that there's a small sphere with a mass of 0.0100 kg and a large sphere with a mass of 0.500 kg. The center-to-center distance between them is 0.0500 meters. I need to find the gravitational force between them, which is given as X multiplied by 10^-10 Newtons. Then, I have to choose the correct X from the options provided.

Hmm, I remember that Newton's law of universal gravitation is the key here. The formula is F = G*(m1*m2)/r², where G is the gravitational constant. Let me recall the value of G. I think it's approximately 6.674×10^-11 N·m²/kg². Yeah, that sounds right.

So, plugging in the values, I have m1 as 0.0100 kg and m2 as 0.500 kg. The distance r is 0.0500 m. Let me write down the formula with these numbers.

F = (6.674e-11) * (0.0100 * 0.500) / (0.0500)^2.

Wait, let me compute each part step by step to avoid mistakes.

First, calculate the product of the masses: 0.0100 kg * 0.500 kg = 0.005 kg². Okay.

Next, the square of the distance: (0.0500 m)^2 = 0.0025 m². Got it.

Now, multiply G by the masses' product: 6.674e-11 * 0.005. Let me compute that. 6.674e-11 * 0.005 = 3.337e-13. Wait, is that right? Let me check: 6.674e-11 is 6.674 times 10^-11. Multiply by 0.005, which is 5e-3. So, 6.674 * 5 is 33.37, and 10^-11 * 10^-3 is 10^-14. So that would be 33.37e-14, which is 3.337e-13. Yeah, correct.

Now, divide that by the squared distance, which is 0.0025. So, 3.337e-13 divided by 0.0025. Let me compute that. 3.337e-13 / 0.0025 = ?

Dividing by 0.0025 is the same as multiplying by 400, because 1/0.0025 = 400. So 3.337e-13 * 400 = 1.3348e-10.

Wait, so F is approximately 1.3348e-10 N. The question says the force is X*10^-10 N, so X is approximately 1.3348. Looking at the options, option B is 1.33, which seems to match closely.

Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Did I use the correct masses and distance? Yes. Did I square the distance correctly? 0.05^2 is 0.0025, correct. Did I compute G*(m1*m2) right? 6.674e-11 * 0.005 = 3.337e-13, yes. Then dividing by 0.0025 gives me 1.3348e-10. That seems right.

Wait, but let me think again. Sometimes, in these problems, I might have mixed up the masses or the distance. Let me confirm that the distance is indeed between the centers, which it is, so that's correct.

Another thing to check: the units. All masses are in kg, distance in meters, so the units for force will be in Newtons, which matches the question. So, I think I did everything correctly.

Therefore, the value of X should be approximately 1.33, which is option B.

The gravitational force between the two spheres is calculated using Newton's law of universal gravitation: \( F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \). Substituting the given values, the force is approximately \( 1.33 \times 10^{-10} \) N, so \( X = 1.33 \).

Answer: B
