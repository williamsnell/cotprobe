Okay, so I've got this holography problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's see if I can figure it out. The question is about estimating the scale of detail in the hologram fringes when given some parameters. Hmm, I remember that holography involves interference patterns, right? So the key here is probably figuring out the interference condition.

The problem states that the reference source and the object are both 1 m away from the hologram plate. They're 100 mm apart. Wait, 100 mm is 0.1 meters. So the distance between the object and the reference source is 0.1 m. The wavelength given is 632.8 nm, which is red light, commonly used in lasers, I think.

I recall that in holography, the spacing between fringes is related to the wavelength and the angles involved. Oh wait, the formula for fringe spacing (d) is something like d = λ * D / (2 * Δx), where D is the distance from the source to the plate, and Δx is the separation between the object and reference sources. Or wait, maybe it's d = λ * D / (Δx). I'm a bit fuzzy on this.

Let me think. The condition for the interference fringes in a hologram is such that the path difference between the object and reference beams causes constructive or destructive interference. The path difference (ΔL) is approximately Δx, the separation between the sources, because they're both about the same distance D from the plate. So the path difference would be roughly Δx, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, more accurately, the path difference is when the light from the object and the reference beam come to the same point on the plate. So the path from the object to the plate is D, and the reference source is also D away, but they're separated by Δx. So the path difference would be something like Δx times sin(theta), but since Δx is small compared to D, maybe we can approximate sin(theta) as theta in radians. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, I remember that the fringe spacing (d) is given by d = λ * D / (Δx). Let me double-check that formula. Oh right, because the angle theta is roughly Δx/(2D), since each source is D away and separated by Δx. So the angle between the object and reference beam is about Δx/(2D). Then the path difference is λ * theta. So the condition for a fringe is when the path difference equals an integer multiple of lambda, leading to d = λ * D / (Δx). Or wait, maybe it's d = λ * D / (2 * Δx). I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: the fringe spacing can be approximated using the formula d = λ * D / (Δx), where Δx is the separation between the object and reference sources. Let's plug in the numbers. λ is 632.8 nm, which is 632.8e-9 meters. D is 1 m, and Δx is 0.1 m.

So d = (632.8e-9 m) * 1 m / 0.1 m = (632.8e-9) / 0.1 = 6.328e-6 m. Hmm, that's 6.33 micrometers, which looks like option D: 6.33 × 10^-6 m.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes the formula includes a factor of 2. Let me think again. If the separation is Δx, the path difference between the two beams at the hologram plate would be approximately Δx * sin(theta), where theta is the angle between the object and reference beams. But since D is much larger than Δx, sin(theta) ≈ tan(theta) = Δx/(2D). So the path difference is Δx * (Δx/(2D)) = Δx²/(2D). Wait, that seems off. Maybe I'm mixing up something here.

Alternatively, the formula I've seen before is d = λ * D / (Δx). So using that, the calculation seems correct. So the answer should be D.

The problem involves estimating the fringe spacing in a holography experiment where the reference source and object are both 1 m from the hologram plate and 100 mm apart, using a wavelength of 632.8 nm. The fringe spacing formula is approximated as \( d = \frac{\lambda D}{\Delta x} \), where \( \lambda = 632.8 \, \text{nm} = 632.8 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \), \( D = 1 \, \text{m} \), and \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{m} \). Substituting these values:

\[
d = \frac{(632.8 \times 10^{-9}) \times 1}{0.1} = 6.328 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \approx 6.33 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}.
\]

This corresponds to option D.
