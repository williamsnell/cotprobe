Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question with two statements, and I need to determine if each is true or not. The options are from A to J, each combining the truth values of the two statements. Let me tackle each statement one by one.

Starting with Statement 1: "Suppose ∑|a_i| diverges and ∑ a_i = 2. There is a rearrangement a_i_k of the terms such that ∑ a_i_k = 4." Hmm, I remember something about series rearrangements from my calculus class. Oh right, Riemann's rearrangement theorem! It says that if a series is conditionally convergent (which means it converges but not absolutely), then its sum can be rearranged to converge to any real number, or even to diverge. 

In this case, ∑|a_i| diverges, so the series ∑a_i is conditionally convergent because ∑a_i converges to 2. So according to Riemann's theorem, we can rearrange the terms to make the sum equal to 4. That makes Statement 1 true. So the first part is True.

Now moving on to Statement 2: "There exists metric spaces X and Y with X closed and bounded and a continuous mapping f : X → Y such that f(X) is NOT closed and bounded." Wait, X is closed and bounded. In metric spaces, closed and bounded sets are called compact if they are also complete, but here X is just closed and bounded. I'm trying to think about examples where a continuous image isn't closed and/or bounded.

Wait, in Euclidean spaces, closed and bounded sets are compact (Heine-Borel theorem), and continuous images of compact sets are compact, hence closed and bounded. But the question is about general metric spaces, not necessarily Euclidean. So X is closed and bounded in some metric space, but without assuming completeness, X might not be compact. Because in general metric spaces, a closed and bounded set isn't necessarily compact unless it's also complete.

So if X is closed and bounded but not compact (so the space isn't complete), then a continuous image might not be closed or bounded. Let's think of an example. 

Let me take X as the interval [0,1] with the usual metric, which is closed and bounded. Let Y be R with the standard metric. Consider a function f: [0,1] → Y that's continuous but not uniformly continuous. Wait, but actually, [0,1] is compact, so any continuous function's image would be compact, hence closed and bounded. So that's not the example.

Wait, maybe I need a different X. Suppose X is a closed and bounded subset of a non-compact metric space. For example, take X as [0, ∞) with the usual metric, which is closed and bounded (since it's the closure of (0, ∞) which is bounded by infinity). Now, let Y be R, and define f: X → Y by f(x) = x. Wait, but X is [0, ∞), so f(X) is [0, ∞), which is closed but not bounded. Wait, no, [0, ∞) is closed in Y=R but not bounded. So f(X) is closed but not bounded. So that's an example where f(X) is closed and not bounded. But the statement says f(X) is NOT closed and bounded. So in this case, it's closed and not bounded, which makes it not both closed and bounded. So f(X) is not closed and bounded because it's not bounded. So Statement 2 is true.

Wait, but wait. Another example: take X as [0,1], but map it into Y as R via f(x) = x. Then f(X) is [0,1], which is closed and bounded. So that doesn't work. But if I take X as [0,1], and Y as R, and f(x) = x/(1-x) for x in [0,1). Wait, no, X is [0,1], so f(1) would be 1/(0), which is undefined. Hmm, maybe another function. Alternatively, take X as [0,1], Y as R, and f(x) = x. Then f(X) is [0,1], which is closed and bounded. That doesn't work.

Wait, maybe X is a closed and bounded subset of a metric space that's not complete. For example, take X as (0,1] in R, which is closed and bounded. Wait, no, (0,1] is not closed in R because it doesn't contain 0. So X needs to be closed. Let me think of a different example.

Alternatively, consider X as the set of real numbers with the metric inherited from R, but X is, say, the interval [0,1]. Wait, that's compact, so f(X) would be compact. Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of a function where f(X) is not closed. Suppose X is [0,1], Y is R, and f(x) = x. Then f(X) is [0,1], which is closed. So not helpful.

Wait, another approach: Let X be a closed and bounded subset of a metric space, but not compact. For example, take Y to be a metric space where X is closed and bounded but not compact. Then, find a continuous function f: X → Y such that f(X) is not closed or not bounded.

Wait, perhaps using a function that's not bounded. For example, take X as [0, ∞) in R, which is closed and bounded? Wait, [0, ∞) is not bounded in R. Oh, wait, X needs to be bounded. So maybe take X as [0,1], Y as R, and f(x) = x. Then f(X) is [0,1], which is closed and bounded. Not helpful.

Alternatively, take X as [0,1] and Y as R, and f(x) = x/(1-x). No, that's only defined for x <1. But X is [0,1], so at x=1, f(1) would be undefined. So that's not a valid function. Hmm.

Wait, maybe X is a closed and bounded set in a metric space where it's not compact. For example, take X as [0,1] in R, which is compact. So any continuous image would be compact. So that's not helpful.

Wait, maybe X is a closed and bounded subset of a metric space that's not complete. Like X is [0,1] in the space Y = [0,1], which is complete, so that's not the case. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a closed and bounded subset of a non-complete metric space. For example, consider Y as the space of rational numbers Q with the standard metric. Let X be [0,1] ∩ Q, which is closed in Q (since Q is dense in R, and [0,1] is closed in R, so [0,1] ∩ Q is closed in Q). But [0,1] ∩ Q is not bounded in Q? Wait, no, it's bounded because all elements are between 0 and 1. So X is closed and bounded in Q.

Now, define f: X → Y as f(x) = x. Then f(X) is [0,1] ∩ Q, which is closed in Y=Q because it's the image of a closed set under continuous function. But is it bounded? Yes, because all elements are between 0 and 1. So that's not the example I need.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the properties. In a metric space, a closed and bounded set isn't necessarily compact unless it's complete. So if X is closed and bounded but not compact, then continuous images might not be compact. But in the case of Y being R, images of closed and bounded sets under continuous functions are not necessarily closed or bounded.

Wait, but in the Heine-Borel theorem, in R^n, closed and bounded implies compact, which means continuous images are compact, hence closed and bounded. But in other metric spaces, this doesn't hold. So perhaps I need to find a metric space X that's closed and bounded but not compact, and a continuous function f: X → Y such that f(X) is not closed and/or not bounded.

Wait, perhaps take X as the set of integers, which is closed and bounded in the space of real numbers with the discrete metric. No, in the discrete metric, every set is both open and closed, but I'm not sure if X being integers is bounded in R. In the standard metric, the integers are unbounded, but in the discrete metric, maybe. Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, maybe consider X as a closed and bounded subset of a metric space where the space isn't complete. For example, take Y as (0,1) with the standard metric, and X as [0, 0.5], which is closed and bounded in Y. Then define f: X → Y as f(x) = x. Then f(X) is [0, 0.5], which is closed and bounded in Y. Not helpful.

Wait, maybe a better approach: take X as [0,1], Y as R, and f(x) = x. Then f(X) is [0,1], which is closed and bounded. Not helpful. But what if f is not surjective? Like f(x) = x^2. Then f(X) is [0,1], still closed and bounded. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps a different function. Let me think of a function where the image is not closed. For example, take X as [0,1], Y as R, and f(x) = x for x in [0,1). Wait, but X is [0,1], so f(1) would be 1. Then f(X) is [0,1], which is closed. Not helpful.

Alternatively, take X as [0,1], Y as R, and f(x) = x/(1-x) for x in [0,1). Wait, but at x=1, it's undefined, so f isn't defined everywhere on X. So that's not a valid function.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the general case. If X is closed and bounded but not compact, then continuous images can fail to be closed or bounded. For example, take X as a closed and bounded subset of a non-compact metric space, and f as a function that's not bounded. Like f(x) = x in X = [0, ∞) in R. But wait, [0, ∞) isn't bounded, so that's not a valid X.

Wait, perhaps another approach: Take X as the set {1/n | n ∈ N} ∪ {0}, which is closed and bounded in R. But it's compact, so any continuous image would be compact. So not helpful.

Wait, maybe I'm stuck. Let me think of a known example. There's a theorem that in a metric space, closed and bounded sets are compact only if the space is complete. So if X is closed and bounded in a non-complete metric space, then it's not compact. Then, there exists a continuous function f: X → Y such that f(X) is not compact, hence not closed or not bounded.

For example, take Y as the space of real numbers with the standard metric, and let X be the interval [0,1]. Wait, but [0,1] is compact in R, so any continuous image would be compact. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, consider X as the interval [0,1] in the space Y = (0,1) with the standard metric. Then X is closed in Y (since it's the closure of (0,1) within Y). Wait, no, [0,1] can't be embedded in Y=(0,1). Maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps a better example: Let Y be the real line, and X be the interval [0,1], which is closed and bounded in Y. Now, define f: X → Y by f(x) = x. Then f(X) = [0,1], which is closed and bounded. Not helpful.

Wait, maybe take X as [0,1] and Y as R, and f(x) = x/(1-x) for x in [0,1). But at x=1, f(1) would be infinity, which isn't in R. So that's not a valid function.

Alternatively, maybe use a function that's not defined on the entire X. No, that's not allowed.

Wait, perhaps X is a closed and bounded subset of a metric space that's not complete, and f maps X to Y in a way that the image isn't closed or bounded. For example, take Y as the space of real numbers, and X as [0,1] with the usual metric. But again, [0,1] is compact, so f(X) would be compact.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should conclude that Statement 2 is true because such examples exist, even if I can't think of them right now. Or perhaps it's false because in some contexts, closed and bounded sets have compact images.

Wait, no, the key is that in general metric spaces, closed and bounded doesn't imply compact, so f(X) might not be closed and bounded. So Statement 2 is true. So both statements are true, so the answer would be J: True, True. But wait, earlier I thought Statement 2 was true because I could find an example where f(X) isn't closed and bounded. Or did I?

Wait, in my earlier example, I thought of X as [0,1] in R, but that's compact, so f(X) would be compact. So maybe I need a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the statement is false because in some cases, images are closed and bounded, but the statement says "there exists" such X and Y. So I need to find at least one example where X is closed and bounded, f is continuous, and f(X) is not closed and bounded.

Wait, maybe take X as the set Q ∩ [0,1], which is closed and bounded in Q (since Q is a metric space where Q is not complete). Then define f: X → Y (where Y=Q) as f(x) = x. Then f(X) = X, which is closed and bounded in Y=Q. Not helpful.

Hmm, maybe another approach: Let X be a closed and bounded subset of a metric space Y, and f: X → Y is continuous. Can f(X) be not closed or not bounded?

Wait, if Y is not complete, perhaps. Let me consider Y as the space (0,1) with the standard metric, and X as [0, 0.5], which is closed and bounded in Y. Now, define f: X → Y as f(x) = x. Then f(X) is [0, 0.5], which is closed and bounded in Y. Not helpful.

Wait, maybe take X as [0,1] in Y = R, and f(x) = x. Then f(X) is [0,1], which is closed and bounded. So that doesn't work.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe X is a closed and bounded set in a non-compact metric space, and f maps it to a space where the image isn't closed or bounded. For example, take Y as R, X as [0,1], but I don't think that works because [0,1] is compact.

Wait, another idea: Take X as the interval [0,1] in Y = R, and f(x) = x^2. Then f(X) is [0,1], which is closed and bounded. Still not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The statement says "there exists" such X and Y. So even if one example exists where f(X) is not closed and bounded, the statement is true. But I'm struggling to find such an example. Maybe the statement is false because in many cases, continuous images of closed and bounded sets are closed and bounded, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but wait. In the example where X is [0,1] in R, f(x) = x. Then f(X) is [0,1], which is closed and bounded. So that's a case where it is closed and bounded. But the statement says that there exists a case where it's not. So I'm trying to find an example where f(X) is not closed or not bounded.

Wait, perhaps take X as a closed and bounded set in a metric space that's not complete. For example, let Y be the space (0,1) with the standard metric, and X be [a, b], where a and b are in Y, so X is closed and bounded in Y. Now, define f: X → Y as f(x) = x. Then f(X) is [a, b], which is closed and bounded in Y. Not helpful.

Wait, maybe another function. Let me think of a function that's continuous but its image isn't bounded. For example, take X as [0,1], Y as R, and f(x) = x/(1-x) for x in [0,1). But wait, at x=1, f(1) would be infinity, which isn't in R. So that's not a valid function.

Alternatively, take X as [0,1], Y as R, and f(x) = x. Then f(X) is [0,1], which is closed and bounded. So that's not helpful.

Wait, maybe I'm stuck. Perhaps Statement 2 is actually true because such examples exist, even if I can't think of them clearly right now. So, to sum up:

Statement 1 is true because of Riemann's rearrangement theorem.

Statement 2 is true because there exist metric spaces where a closed and bounded set's continuous image is not closed and bounded.

So the answer would be J: True, True.
</think>

Statement 1 is true due to Riemann's rearrangement theorem, which allows conditional convergent series to be rearranged to any desired sum. Statement 2 is true because in general metric spaces, closed and bounded sets are not necessarily compact, so continuous images can fail to be closed or bounded.
