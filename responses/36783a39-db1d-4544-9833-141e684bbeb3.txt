Question:

A homeowner resides downhill from a metal fabrication facility. She has sued both the owner of the facility and the supplier of a solvent used at the facility. She contends that contaminants, consisting mostly of the solvent, were released into the ground at the facility and have migrated and continue to migrate to her property, contaminating the soil, the groundwater, and her well. She alleges various acts of negligence on the part of the facility owner in causing the release of the contaminants into the ground. She also alleges that employees of the solvent supplier were negligent in frequently the solvent supplier were negligent in frequently spilling some of the solvent onto the ground while filling a rooftop tank at the facility. The solvent supplier has moved for summary judgment, arguing that if there was any contamination, the facility owner and the supplier independently contributed indeterminate amounts to the contamination and that therefore the homeowner cannot show how much damage each has inflicted on her. There is no evidence that the facility owner and the solvent supplier acted in concert. Should the court grant the summary judgment motion?

Options:

A: No, because the solvent supplier should have taken precautions to prevent spills.
B: No, because the solvent supplier is directly responsible for the contamination.
C: Yes, because the solvent supplier can't be held accountable for the negligence of the facility owner.
D: Yes, because there is no basis for allocating damages against the solvent supplier. damages against the solvent supplier.
E: Yes, because the negligence of the facility owner is the primary cause of contamination.
F: No, because the solvent supplier is vicariously liable for damage inflicted by the facility owner.
G: Yes, because there is no evidence that the facility owner and the solvent supplier acted in concert.
H: Yes, because the homeowner does not have substantial proof of contamination.
I: No, because concurrent tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable for an indivisible injury.
J: No, because the solvent supplier and the facility owner are both responsible for the contamination, regardless of the amount each contributed.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let me read it again and break it down.

The situation is a homeowner living downhill from a metal fabrication facility. She's suing both the facility owner and the solvent supplier. The issue is that contaminants, mostly the solvent, were released and migrated to her property, contaminating soil, groundwater, and her well. 

She's alleging negligence against the facility owner for releasing the contaminants. Also, she's suing the solvent supplier because their employees negligently spilled solvent onto the ground while filling a rooftop tank. 

The solvent supplier is moving for summary judgment, arguing that if there was any contamination, both the facility owner and supplier contributed indeterminate amounts. So, the homeowner can't show how much damage each caused. They also note there's no evidence they acted in concert.

The question is whether the court should grant the motion for summary judgment.

So, the key points here are about tort law, specifically negligence and joint and several liability.

I remember that in tort law, when multiple parties are at fault and their actions combine to cause a single injury, each can be held jointly and severally liable. That means the plaintiff can recover the full amount from any one defendant, and each defendant is responsible for the entire damage.

But if the harm is divisible, meaning the plaintiff can show how much each defendant contributed, then each is only liable for their share. If not, joint and several applies.

In this case, the contamination is ongoing and the source contributions are indeterminate. So the contamination is an indivisible injury because you can't split it into parts caused by each defendant. The homeowner doesn't have to prove how much each contributed; they just need to show both contributed to the same harm.

So, the solvent supplier's argument that they can't be held liable because they can't determine the exact damage is not a valid defense. The joint and several liability applies here because the harm is indivisible.

Looking at the options, I'm looking for an answer that aligns with this reasoning.

Option I says, "No, because concurrent tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable for an indivisible injury." That seems correct because the contamination is a single harm caused by both parties.

Other options: Option A talks about precautions, but that's about the duty, not liability after the fact. Option B says the supplier is directly responsible, but the issue is more about joint liability. Option C is about not being liable for the owner's negligence, which isn't the case here. Option D is about allocating damages, which isn't possible, so the supplier is liable. Option E says the facility owner is primary, but that doesn't negate the supplier's liability. Option F is about vicarious liability, which isn't the case here. Option G is about acting in concert, but the problem states there's no evidence of that, but joint liability doesn't require acting in concert. Option H is about proof of contamination, but the question says she does contend it exists. Option J says both are responsible regardless of contribution, which is correct but perhaps less precise than I.

Wait, between I and J. I is about joint and several liability, which is a specific legal doctrine. J is a bit more general but also correct. However, the question is about whether the court should grant summary judgment. The defendant is arguing that without determinable damages, they can't be held liable. But under joint and several liability, they can still be held liable because the harm is indivisible.

So the correct answer is I: No, because concurrent tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable for an indivisible injury.

The homeowner is suing both the facility owner and the solvent supplier for negligence causing contamination. The solvent supplier argues that without determinable contributions, they shouldn't be liable. However, under joint and several liability, when harm is indivisible, each defendant can be held fully responsible. Since the contamination is a single injury caused by both parties, the supplier can't avoid liability on this basis.

Answer: I
