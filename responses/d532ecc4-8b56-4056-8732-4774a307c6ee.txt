Okay, so I have this question about the OLS estimator and the standard error of the slope coefficient. I'm a bit rusty on my econometrics, but let me try to think this through step by step.

The question lists four statements (i) through (iv) and asks which are true. The options are from A to J, each combining different statements. I need to figure out which statements are correct.

First, let's recall what the standard error (SE) of the slope coefficient represents. The SE is a measure of the variability or precision of the estimated slope coefficient. A smaller SE means the estimate is more precise, and a larger SE means more variability.

The formula for the standard error of the slope (b1) in simple linear regression is something like SE(b1) = sqrt( (MSE) / (SS_x) ), where MSE is the mean squared error (residual variance) and SS_x is the sum of squares of the explanatory variable x around its mean.

So, let's break down each statement:

(i) The standard error will be positively related to the residual variance.

Residual variance is MSE. From the formula, as MSE increases, the SE(b1) increases because it's in the numerator under a square root. So (i) is true.

(ii) The standard error will be negatively related to the dispersion of the observations on the explanatory variable about their mean value.

Dispersion of x around its mean is SS_x. In the formula, SS_x is in the denominator. As SS_x increases, the SE(b1) decreases because you're dividing by a larger number. So if x is more spread out, the SE is smaller. So (ii) is saying a negative relationship, which is correct. So (ii) is true.

(iii) The standard error will be negatively related to the sample size.

Sample size affects the variance of the estimates. In the formula, as the sample size n increases, the variance of the error terms decreases (assuming homoscedasticity), so MSE would decrease. Alternatively, looking at the formula, the SE also depends on the sample size because SS_x is related to n. Wait, actually, the formula for SE(b1) is sqrt( (MSE) / (SS_x) ). As n increases, assuming x varies, SS_x would increase, which would decrease the SE. So larger sample size leads to smaller SE. So the SE is negatively related to sample size. So (iii) is true.

(iv) The standard error gives a measure of the precision of the coefficient estimate.

Yes, the standard error is used to assess the precision. A smaller SE means the estimate is more precise. So (iv) is true.

Now, checking the options:

Looking back:

(i) is true.

(ii) is true.

(iii) is true.

(iv) is true.

So all four statements (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) are correct. Let me check the options again.

Option B is (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv). So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Could any of these statements be incorrect?

Wait, statement (iii): the SE is negatively related to sample size. So as n increases, SE decreases. That's correct because with more data, the estimates are more precise. So yes, (iii) is correct.

And statement (ii) says the SE is negatively related to the dispersion of x. So higher dispersion (more spread out x) leads to lower SE, which is correct.

So all four statements are true, which means the correct option is B.

The standard error of the slope coefficient in OLS regression is influenced by the residual variance, the dispersion of the explanatory variable, the sample size, and its role in measuring precision. Statements (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) are all true, making option B the correct answer.

Answer: B
