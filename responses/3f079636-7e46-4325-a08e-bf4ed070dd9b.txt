Okay, so I've got this question about fugacity of water, and I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let's try to work through it. The question gives me some data, and I need to choose the correct answer from options A to J.

First, I remember that fugacity is a concept used in thermodynamics, especially for gases, to account for non-ideal behavior. It's like an effective pressure that a gas exerts. For an ideal gas, fugacity is equal to the pressure, but for real gases, it can differ.

The question gives the temperature as 298 K, which is about 25°C, a common temperature for many experiments. The pressure is 10^7 N/m², which I think is equivalent to 10^7 Pascals. Wait, 1 Pascal is 1 N/m², so yes, that's 10^7 Pa. That's about 100 kPa, which is roughly atmospheric pressure, but maybe a bit higher. Wait, no, 1 atm is about 101325 Pa, so 10^7 Pa is way higher. Wait, 10^7 Pa is 10,000,000 Pa, which is 10,000 kPa or 10 MPa. That's quite high, much higher than atmospheric pressure. So the system here is under high pressure.

The properties given are: density (rho) = 997 kg/m³, molecular weight (MW) = 18.02 kg/kg mol, and P_c (vapor pressure) = 3160 N/m². Wait, P_c is usually the critical pressure, but here it's labeled as vapor pressure. Hmm, maybe it's a typo, or perhaps they're using P_c to denote the vapor pressure at that temperature. Because at 298 K, the vapor pressure of water is around 23.8 kPa, but 3160 N/m² is about 3.16 kPa, which doesn't match. Wait, 3160 N/m² is 3160 Pascals, which is 3.16 kPa. That's lower than the standard vapor pressure of water at 25°C, which is about 23.8 kPa. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, the question says P_c is the vapor pressure. So perhaps P_c here is 3160 N/m², which is 3.16 kPa. That's lower than the actual vapor pressure at 298 K, which is about 23.8 kPa. So maybe this is a mistake, or perhaps it's referring to a different property. Alternatively, perhaps P_c is the critical pressure, but that's a different concept. The critical pressure of water is much higher, around 221 bar or about 22.1 MPa. So that must not be it. So, perhaps the given P_c is the vapor pressure at 298 K, but that's inconsistent with real data. Hmm, maybe it's a mistake in the problem statement, but I'll proceed with the given data.

The question is asking for the fugacity of water at 298 K and 10^7 N/m² pressure. So, I need to find f_water.

I recall that the fugacity f is given by f = P * exp( (P/(RT)) * V_f ), where V_f is the molar volume. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me think again.

The fugacity coefficient φ is defined by f = φ * P, where P is the pressure. The fugacity coefficient can be calculated using various equations of state, but for an ideal gas, φ=1, so f=P. However, for real gases, φ deviates from 1.

At high pressures, the deviation from ideal gas behavior becomes more significant. So, at 10^7 Pa (10 MPa), which is quite high, the fugacity will be less than the pressure because gases tend to be more non-ideal under higher pressures.

Wait, but wait, water at 10 MPa and 298 K is likely in the liquid phase because the pressure is much higher than the vapor pressure. So if the system is in the liquid phase, then the fugacity would be close to the vapor pressure, but that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts.

Wait, no. Fugacity is a concept primarily applied to gases. If water is in the liquid phase under 10 MPa and 298 K, then the fugacity would be negligible because liquids don't exert pressure in the same way as gases. But that doesn't fit with the options given, which are all positive pressures.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the fugacity of the liquid phase, which is a different concept. Wait, but I think fugacity is more relevant for the vapor phase. Maybe the question is about the fugacity of the liquid, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the fugacity of water vapor in the system. If the system is at 10^7 N/m², which is 10 MPa, and the temperature is 298 K, then the vapor pressure is given as 3160 N/m². Wait, that's 3.16 kPa, which is much lower than 10 MPa. So perhaps the system is in the liquid phase, and the fugacity would be equal to the vapor pressure, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe I should approach this using the ideal gas law and the given data. Let's see.

The fugacity f is given by f = φ * P. But to find φ, I might need to use the virial equation or another relation. However, without knowing the virial coefficients, perhaps there's another approach.

Alternatively, for a liquid, the fugacity is equal to the vapor pressure times exp( (P V_m)/(R T) ), where V_m is the molar volume of the liquid. Wait, that's a formula I remember. So the fugacity of the liquid is f = P_c * exp( P * V_m / (R T) ), where P_c is the vapor pressure.

Wait, let me get that right. The fugacity f for the liquid phase is given by f = P_c * exp( (P * V_m) / (R T) ), where P_c is the vapor pressure at temperature T, P is the pressure, and V_m is the molar volume of the liquid.

So, given that, I can calculate f.

Let's get the values:

P = 10^7 N/m² = 10^7 Pa.

P_c = 3160 N/m² = 3160 Pa.

MW = 18.02 kg/kmol. Wait, molecular weight is in kg per kmol? Wait, no, molecular weight is usually in g/mol, so 18.02 g/mol is 0.01802 kg/mol. Wait, but the given MW is 18.02 kg/kg mol. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse that.

MW = 18.02 kg/kg mol. So, that would be 18.02 kg per kg mole. Wait, that doesn't make sense because a mole is a unit of amount, not mass. Oh, perhaps it's 18.02 kg per kmol. Because 1 kmol is 10^3 mol. So, 18.02 kg/kmol would be 0.01802 kg/mol, which is correct because the molecular weight of water is about 18 g/mol.

So, MW = 18.02 kg/kmol = 0.01802 kg/mol.

Density rho = 997 kg/m³.

So, the molar volume V_m is the inverse of density times MW, but wait, V_m = (mass)/(density * moles) = (MW) / (rho * 10^3). Wait, perhaps more accurately, V_m = (volume per mole) = (volume per kg) * (kg per mole). Since density rho is kg/m³, the specific volume (volume per kg) is 1/rho m³/kg.

So, V_m = (1/rho) * (1/MW) )? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Molar volume V_m is the volume occupied by one mole of the substance. So, if the density is rho kg/m³, then the volume per kg is 1/rho m³/kg. Since one mole is MW kg, the volume per mole is (1/rho) * (1/MW) )? Wait, no.

Wait, density rho = mass/volume → volume = mass/rho. So, for one mole, mass is MW kg, so volume V_m = (MW kg) / rho (kg/m³) ) → V_m = MW / rho m³/mol.

Yes, that makes sense. So,

V_m = MW / rho = (18.02 kg/kmol) / (997 kg/m³) = 18.02 / 997 m³/kmol.

Wait, but that's per kmol. Since 1 kmol is 10^3 mol, we need to adjust. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to convert MW to kg/mol.

Wait, MW is given as 18.02 kg/kg mol. So, that's 18.02 kg per kg mol, which is 18.02 kg/(kg·mol) → that's 18.02 mol⁻¹. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's 18.02 kg per kmol. Because 18.02 kg/kmol is 0.01802 kg/mol, which is correct.

So, V_m = MW / rho = (18.02 kg/kmol) / (997 kg/m³) = (18.02 / 997) m³/kmol.

But since 1 kmol is 10^3 mol, V_m in m³/mol is (18.02 / 997) / 10^3 = (18.02 / 997000) m³/mol.

Wait, but that seems very small. Let me compute it numerically.

18.02 / 997 ≈ 0.01808 m³/kmol → 0.01808 m³ per 1000 mol → so per mol, it's 0.01808 / 1000 = 1.808e-5 m³/mol.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have kept it in kmol. Let me recheck.

rho = 997 kg/m³ → volume per kg is 1/997 m³/kg.

MW = 18.02 kg/kmol → so per kmol, it's 18.02 kg. So, the molar volume V_m is (18.02 kg) / (997 kg/m³) ) = 18.02 / 997 m³/kmol → which is approximately 0.01808 m³/kmol.

To get molar volume per mol, divide by 1000: 0.01808 / 1000 = 1.808e-5 m³/mol.

Now, R is the gas constant. R is 8.314 J/(mol·K).

Temperature T is 298 K.

So, the exponent in the fugacity formula is (P * V_m) / (R T).

Let's compute that.

P = 10^7 N/m².

V_m = 1.808e-5 m³/mol.

R = 8.314 J/(mol·K).

T = 298 K.

So,

(P * V_m)/(R T) = (10^7 * 1.808e-5) / (8.314 * 298)

Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 10^7 * 1.808e-5 = 1e7 * 1.808e-5 = 100 * 1.808 = 180.8.

Denominator: 8.314 * 298 ≈ 8.314 * 300 = 2494.2, but more accurately, 8.314 * 298 = let's compute:

298 = 300 - 2.

8.314 * 300 = 2494.2.

8.314 * 2 = 16.628.

So, 2494.2 - 16.628 = 2477.572.

So, denominator ≈ 2477.572.

So, the exponent is 180.8 / 2477.572 ≈ 0.0729.

So, exp(0.0729) ≈ e^0.0729 ≈ 1.0756.

So, the fugacity f = P_c * 1.0756.

P_c is given as 3160 N/m².

So, f ≈ 3160 * 1.0756 ≈ let's compute that.

3160 * 1.0756:

First, 3160 * 1 = 3160.

3160 * 0.07 = 221.2.

3160 * 0.0056 ≈ 17.776.

Adding up: 3160 + 221.2 = 3381.2 + 17.776 ≈ 3398.976 N/m².

Looking at the options, option D is 3400 N/m², which is very close.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, let's recompute the exponent:

(P * V_m) / (R T) = (1e7 * 1.808e-5) / (8.314 * 298)

Compute numerator: 1e7 * 1.808e-5 = 1e2 * 1.808 = 180.8.

Denominator: 8.314 * 298 = let's compute more accurately.

8.314 * 200 = 1662.8

8.314 * 98 = let's compute 8.314 * 100 = 831.4, minus 8.314*2=16.628 → 831.4 -16.628=814.772.

So total denominator: 1662.8 + 814.772 = 2477.572.

So, 180.8 / 2477.572 ≈ 0.0729.

e^0.0729 ≈ using Taylor series:

e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2 + x³/6.

x=0.0729.

x² = 0.00531.

x³=0.000386.

So,

1 + 0.0729 + 0.00531/2 + 0.000386/6 ≈ 1 + 0.0729 + 0.002655 + 0.0000643 ≈ 1.0756.

So, yes, that's correct.

So, f = 3160 * 1.0756 ≈ 3160 * 1.0756.

Let me compute 3160 * 1.0756:

3160 * 1 = 3160.

3160 * 0.07 = 221.2.

3160 * 0.0056 = let's compute 3160 * 0.005 = 15.8, and 3160 * 0.0006 = 1.896. So total 15.8 +1.896=17.696.

So, 3160 + 221.2 = 3381.2 +17.696 ≈ 3398.896 → approx 3399 N/m².

Looking at the options, the closest is D:3400 N/m².

So the answer must be D.

The fugacity of water at 298 K and 10^7 N/m² is calculated using the formula for liquid fugacity:  
\[ f = P_c \cdot \exp\left(\frac{P \cdot V_m}{R \cdot T}\right) \]  
where \( P_c \) is the vapor pressure, \( P \) is the pressure, \( V_m \) is the molar volume, \( R \) is the gas constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.  

Given data:  
- \( P = 10^7 \, \text{N/m}^2 \)  
- \( P_c = 3160 \, \text{N/m}^2 \)  
- \( \rho = 997 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \)  
- \( \text{MW} = 18.02 \, \text{kg/kmol} = 0.01802 \, \text{kg/mol} \)  
- \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \)  
- \( T = 298 \, \text{K} \)  

First, calculate the molar volume \( V_m \):  
\[
V_m = \frac{\text{MW}}{\rho} = \frac{0.01802 \, \text{kg/mol}}{997 \, \text{kg/m}^3} = 1.808 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{m}^3/\text{mol}.
\]

Next, compute the exponent:  
\[
\frac{P \cdot V_m}{R \cdot T} = \frac{(10^7) \cdot (1.808 \times 10^{-5})}{8.314 \cdot 298} = \frac{180.8}{2477.572} \approx 0.0729.
\]

Then, calculate the exponential term:  
\[
\exp(0.0729) \approx 1.0756.
\]

Finally, compute the fugacity:  
\[
f = P_c \cdot 1.0756 = 3160 \cdot 1.0756 \approx 3399 \, \text{N/m}^2.
\]

The closest option is **D: 3400 N/m²**.
