Okay, so I've got this question about shunt motors and field excitation power. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my motor basics, but let me think this through.

Alright, the question says the field winding has a resistance of 110 ohms, and the voltage applied is 220 volts. I need to find the power expended in the field excitation.

Wait, field excitation in a shunt motor refers to the current in the field winding, right? Because in shunt motors, the field is connected in parallel with the armature. So the voltage across the field is the same as the supply voltage, which is 220 volts here.

Power in an electrical component can be calculated using the formula P = V × I, where P is power, V is voltage, and I is current. But I don't have the current; I have the resistance. Oh right, I can find the current using Ohm's Law, which is I = V / R.

So let's plug in the numbers. The voltage V is 220 volts, and the resistance R is 110 ohms. So I = 220 / 110. Let me do that division: 220 divided by 110 is 2. So the current I is 2 amps.

Now, with the current known, I can find the power. P = V × I, so that's 220 volts multiplied by 2 amps. 220 times 2 is 440. So the power is 440 watts.

Looking at the options, option H is 440 watts. That must be the correct answer.

Wait a second, did I miss anything? Oh, right, field excitation in a shunt motor is just the power in the field winding, which we've calculated correctly. Yeah, I think that's right.

The field winding has a resistance of 110 ohms and a voltage of 220 volts. Using Ohm's Law, the current is 220 V / 110 Ω = 2 A. Power is then calculated as P = V × I = 220 V × 2 A = 440 W.

Answer: H
