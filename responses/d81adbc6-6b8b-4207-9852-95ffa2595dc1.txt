Question:

The percentage of successful single pairmatingsobserved forone hour in Drosophilamelanogastercultures showed thefollowing: Matings Before crossing wild stock with yellow stock for 7generations After crossing wild stock with yellow stock for 7generations WT male × WT female 62 75 Yellow male × WT female 34 47 WT male × yellow female 87 81 Yellow male × yellow female 78 59 Yellow is a recessive mutant strain of flies that is phenotypicallyexpressed as a yellow rather than gray body. Explain how this mutation affects the mating behavior of D.melanogaster.

Options:

A: Wild-type females are less successful in mating with yellow males.
B: The males with the yellow mutation are less successful in mating with wild-type gray females than are wild-type males.
C: Yellow females prefer to mate with yellow males, leading to higher success rates.
D: Wild-type males preferentially mate with yellow females, increasing success rates.
E: Wild-type males are less successful in mating with yellow females
F: The mutation leads to increased aggression in males, reducing mating success.
G: Yellow mutation does not affect mating behavior
H: The yellow mutation enhances the attractiveness of both males and females, leading to higher mating success rates.
I: Yellow mutation increases the success rate of mating

Okay, so I have this question about Drosophila melanogaster mating behaviors, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question gives me data on successful single pair matings observed for one hour in cultures of fruit flies. The data is split into two scenarios: before and after crossing wild stock with yellow stock for seven generations. The four different matings observed are:

1. WT male × WT female: 62% before, 75% after
2. Yellow male × WT female: 34% before, 47% after
3. WT male × yellow female: 87% before, 81% after
4. Yellow male × yellow female: 78% before, 59% after

The yellow mutation is a recessive trait, so only homozygous individuals (yellow/yellow) will show the yellow phenotype. Wild type is gray, and yellow is the recessive mutant.

The question is asking how this mutation affects the mating behavior of D. melanogaster. The options are A to I, each suggesting a different effect.

Looking at the data, I notice that the percentages of successful matings change after crossing the wild and yellow stocks for seven generations. Let me analyze each pairing before and after.

1. WT male × WT female: The success rate increased from 62% to 75%. So, when both are wild-type, they are more successful after the crossing. Maybe there's some inbreeding effect before, and after crossing, they are less related, so more successful?

2. Yellow male × WT female: Before crossing, 34% success; after, 47%. That's an increase. So yellow males mating with wild-type females become more successful.

3. WT male × yellow female: Before, 87%; after, 81%. So a slight decrease. Hmm, maybe not a big change.

4. Yellow male × yellow female: Before, 78%; after, 59%. That's a significant drop. So yellow males with yellow females are less successful after crossing.

Wait, but why would that be? Maybe after crossing, the population has more heterozygotes, and the homozygous yellows are less fit? Or perhaps the yellow mutation affects their ability to mate successfully when paired with certain types.

The options suggest possible explanations. Let me look at the options:

Option B says that yellow males are less successful with wild-type females than wild males. Before crossing, yellow males had 34% success, while wild males had 62% (WT×WT). So yes, yellow males were less successful. After crossing, their success increased to 47%, which is still less than 75% for WT×WT. So B seems to fit because even after crossing, yellow males are still less successful with wild females than wild males are.

Option A says wild-type females are less successful with yellow males. That's the same as B but phrased differently. A is saying that when the female is wild and the male is yellow, they are less successful. Which is true, but the data shows improvement after crossing. So A is correct in that they're less successful, but the option doesn't mention the change after crossing.

Option C suggests yellow females prefer yellow males, leading to higher success. Before crossing, yellow×yellow was 78%, which is higher than WT×yellow (87%). Wait, no, 78 is less than 87. So yellow females with yellow males were less successful than with wild males. After crossing, yellow×yellow drops to 59%, which is even lower. So C might not be right because the success rate isn't higher; it's lower.

Option D says wild-type males prefer yellow females, increasing success. Before, WT males with yellow females had 87% success, which is higher than the other pairings except for the same WT×WT. After crossing, it went down a bit to 81%, but still high. So wild males are more successful with yellow females, but the option says they preferentially mate, increasing success. But the data shows that the success rate is high in the first place, perhaps due to preference.

Option E says WT males are less successful with yellow females. But E is not correct because the data shows high success (87 before, 81 after). So E is wrong.

Option F suggests increased aggression in males, reducing success. But the data doesn't support that. Some pairings have increased success, so F doesn't fit.

Option G says the mutation doesn't affect mating behavior. But clearly, the success rates change, so G is incorrect.

Option H says the mutation enhances attractiveness, leading to higher success. But looking at the data, when both are yellow, their success drops after crossing. So H can't be right because it would predict higher success, not lower.

Option I says the mutation increases success rates. But in the yellow×yellow case, it decreased. So I is incorrect.

So, the main point is that yellow males are less successful with wild-type females. Before crossing, 34% success; after, 47%, which is still lower than WT×WT (75%). So the mutation makes the males less successful, which aligns with option B.

Wait, but after crossing, the yellow males' success with wild females increased. So maybe the issue is not just the mutation but the genetic background. Alternatively, perhaps it's about assortative mating. For instance, after crossing, the flies might have more heterozygotes, so when a yellow male (probably homozygous recessive) mates with a wild-type female (heterozygous or homozygous dominant?), the offspring might have certain viability. But the question is about mating behavior, not viability.

Alternatively, maybe the yellow mutation affects the males' ability to court or compete. For example, yellow males might have lower fitness in terms of mating because they can't perform as well in courtship displays. So they are less successful when paired with wild-type females, which is what option B says.

Looking back, the only option that directly addresses the male's success with wild-type females is B. Other options either don't fit the data or make incorrect claims.

The data shows that yellow males are less successful in mating with wild-type females compared to wild-type males, both before and after crossing. While the success rate of yellow males with wild-type females increases after crossing, it remains lower than that of wild-type males. This suggests that the yellow mutation negatively impacts the mating success of males when paired with wild-type females. 

Answer: B
