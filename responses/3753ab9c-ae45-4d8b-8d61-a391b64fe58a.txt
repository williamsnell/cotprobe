Okay, so I've got this question about employment tests and legal challenges. The question is asking which type of test is most likely to withstand a legal challenge if there's an adverse impact on a minority group. The options are A through J, each a different type of test.

First, I need to understand the context. Adverse impact refers to a situation where a job selection process disproportionately affects a protected group, like minorities. Under U.S. law, specifically Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, employers must ensure that their selection processes don't have such a disparate impact unless they can justify it as job-related and consistent with business necessity.

So, the key here is which test type is most defensible in court. I remember that tests based on job-related skills and abilities are more likely to hold up because they can be shown to correlate with job performance. Cognitive ability tests, for example, measure general mental aptitude, which is often relevant for many jobs.

Looking at the options:

A: Projective tests are more about personality and can be subjective, so they might not be as defensible.
B: Empirically keyed tests are based on job performance data, which is good, but the question is about the best chance.
C: Personality tests assess traits but may not directly relate to job tasks.
D: Multiple-choice tests can vary widely in content; it's more about what's being tested.
E: Computer adaptive tests are just a delivery method, not the content.
F: Integrity tests measure honesty, which is important but might not directly tie to job skills.
G: Work sample tests involve tasks similar to those performed on the job. These are highly defensible because they directly relate to job performance.
H: Situational judgement tests present scenarios and assess decision-making, which can be relevant.
I: Cognitive ability tests measure general intelligence, which is strongly tied to job performance across many roles.
J: Polygraph tests are invasive and not commonly used; their admissibility can be questionable.

Between G and I, work samples are great because they directly demonstrate ability to perform the job. Cognitive ability tests are also strong because they predict job performance well. However, in court, cognitive tests might be challenged if they don't directly relate to the job's specific requirements. Work samples, on the other hand, are more concrete evidence of job-related skills.

Wait, but I also recall that cognitive tests, especially when validated properly, are often considered more objective and have a strong basis in job-relatedness. They are widely used and have legal precedents supporting their use if properly justified.

So, I think the best answer is either G or I. Work samples are excellent, but cognitive ability tests might be more commonly used and have more established legal support. But wait, the question is about withstanding an adverse impact. If a test has adverse impact, the employer needs to show it's job-related. So, the test that can best demonstrate job-relatedness would be more defensible.

Work sample tests are very job-specific and thus can clearly show relevance, making them strong candidates. Cognitive tests are also relevant but might be more easily challenged if the job doesn't require high cognitive demands.

But wait, cognitive ability is a broad predictor of job performance across many jobs, so even if the job isn't highly cognitive, using a cognitive test that's validated could still be defensible. However, if the adverse impact is observed, the employer would need to prove the test is job-related. Work samples would make that easier because they directly measure the ability to perform the job tasks.

So, I'm a bit torn between G and I. Work sample (G) might be the best because it directly measures job performance, making it hard to challenge on job-relatedness grounds. Cognitive ability (I) is also strong but might be more about general aptitude, which could be seen as less directly tied to specific job tasks.

Wait, the question is about which test has the best chance of withstanding a legal challenge. Work sample tests are considered one of the strongest because they correlate highly with job performance and are directly tied to the tasks. So, I think G is the correct answer.

The best type of test to withstand a legal challenge when adverse impact is observed is the **Work Sample Test (G)**. These tests directly assess job-related skills and performance, making them highly defensible in court. 

Answer: G
