Alright, let's tackle this break-even analysis problem. Okay, so the man sells novelty items for $1.25 each. His cost is $0.75 per item plus a fixed cost of $140,000. I need to find out how many items he must sell to break even and what his sales revenue would be at that point. 

First, I remember that the break-even point is where total revenue equals total cost. So, I need to set up the equations for revenue and total cost and solve for the number of units.

The revenue (R) should be the selling price per unit multiplied by the number of units sold (let's call that x). So, R = 1.25x.

The total cost (C) has two parts: the variable cost per unit and the fixed cost. Variable cost is 0.75 per item, so that's 0.75x. The fixed cost is $140,000. So, total cost C = 0.75x + 140,000.

At the break-even point, R = C. So, I can set up the equation:

1.25x = 0.75x + 140,000.

Hmm, let me solve for x. Subtract 0.75x from both sides to get:

1.25x - 0.75x = 140,000.

That simplifies to 0.50x = 140,000.

So, x = 140,000 / 0.50.

Calculating that, 140,000 divided by 0.5 is the same as multiplying by 2, so x = 280,000 units.

Wait, but let me double-check that division. 0.5 times 280,000 is indeed 140,000, so that's correct. So he needs to sell 280,000 units to break even.

Now, the sales revenue at that point would be the selling price per unit times the number of units, so 1.25 * 280,000.

Let me compute that: 1.25 * 280,000. Well, 1 times 280,000 is 280,000, and 0.25 times 280,000 is 70,000. Adding them together, 280,000 +70,000 = 350,000.

So, the break-even point is 280,000 units and $350,000 in revenue.

Looking at the options, option H is 280,000 units and $350,000. So that must be the correct answer.

To determine the break-even point, we set total revenue equal to total cost. The revenue is $1.25 per item, and the total cost includes $0.75 per item plus a fixed cost of $140,000. Solving the equation $1.25x = $0.75x + $140,000 gives x = 280,000 units. The revenue at this point is $1.25 * 280,000 = $350,000.

Answer: H
