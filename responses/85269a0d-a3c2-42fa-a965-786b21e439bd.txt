Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Woman, wake up; the bell of reason is being heard throughout the whole universe; discover your rights. Enslaved man has multiplied his strength, [but] having become free, he has become unjust to his companion. Oh, women, women! When will you cease to be blind? What advantage have you received from the Revolution? A more pronounced scorn, a more marked disdain. If our leaders persist, courageously oppose the force of reason to their empty pretentions of superiority. Regardless of what barriers confront you, it is in your power to free yourselves!
Olympe de Gouges, "Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen," 1791
The independence? Nothing of what I hoped for was achieved. I had expected that my children would be able to have an education, but they did not get it. We were poor peasants then, we are poor peasants now. Nothing has changed. Everything is the same. The only thing is that we are free, the war is over, we work without fearâ€”but apart from that, nothing has changed.
Halima Ghomri, interviewed in the 1970s, after Algeria's war of independence

Okay, so I have this question here about two passages and I need to figure out which factor prevented the progress the speaker in the second passage hoped for. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the two passages are from different sources. The first one is by Olympe de Gouges, a Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen from 1791. She's talking about women's rights and how even though men have gained freedom, they've become unjust to women. She's calling on women to rise up and not be blind to their situation, questioning what the Revolution has done for them. So, this is about the French Revolution and women's rights.

The second passage is from Halima Ghomri, interviewed after Algeria's war of independence in the 1970s. She says that nothing has changed since the war. They were poor peasants before and still are. The war is over, they're free, they work without fear, but otherwise, everything is the same. Her main point is that the expected changes, like education for her children, didn't happen. So, this is about the impact of national independence on social conditions.

The question is asking which factor is likeliest to have prevented the progress she hoped for. The options are A to J, each a possible factor.

Looking at the options:

A: Hostility to women's rights on the part of new elites
B: Inadequate healthcare facilities
C: Corruption within the new government
D: Prioritization of national liberation over social reform
E: Resistance from foreign powers
F: Lack of industrial assets or infrastructure
G: Lack of support from the general population
H: Failure to eradicate Islamic traditionalism
I: Economic instability
J: Lack of educational resources

So, in Halima's case, she's talking about Algeria after independence. She mentions that the war ended, they're free, but nothing else changed. Her children didn't get education, and they remain poor peasants. So, the issue is that the hoped-for social reforms, like education, didn't materialize.

The possible reasons could be several. Let me think about the context of Algeria's independence. Algeria gained independence from France in 1962. The war was about national liberation, but what about social reforms? I recall that in many post-colonial nations, once independence is achieved, the new government often focuses on national unity and stability before addressing social issues like education and gender equality.

So, the new government might have prioritized national liberation over social reforms. That would mean that while they were busy establishing the country's independence and dealing with the immediate post-war issues, they didn't focus on implementing the necessary social changes. This could explain why Halima's children didn't get the education she hoped for.

Looking at the options again, D says "Prioritization of national liberation over social reform." That seems to fit because the government might have thought that achieving independence was more urgent than addressing social issues like education and women's rights.

Another option that comes to mind is A: Hostility to women's rights by new elites. But in Algeria, the new government after independence was more focused on national identity and might have had their own priorities. However, Halima's issue is more about lack of education and economic status, which ties more to social reforms rather than women's rights directly. So, while A is possible, D seems more relevant.

Option J is "Lack of educational resources." But Halima didn't get education for her children, implying that the system wasn't prioritized. So, it's not just about resources but about the government's focus.

Option I: Economic instability. Algeria's economy might have been unstable, but Halima's situation is about peasants who were and remained poor. Economic instability could be a factor, but the question is about what prevented progress in social reforms, which ties more to D.

So, putting it together, the most likely factor is D: Prioritization of national liberation over social reform.

The speaker in the second passage, Halima Ghomri, expresses disappointment that her children did not receive the education she had hoped for after Algeria's war of independence. This suggests that the government prioritized national liberation over addressing social reforms like education. Therefore, the factor that likeliest prevented the progress she hoped for is the prioritization of national liberation over social reform.

Answer: D
