Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the mean salary for office assistants in a company with two offices. Let me see how I can approach this. 

Alright, the company has offices in New Jersey and Utah. The mean salary in New Jersey is $28,500, and in Utah, it's $22,500. The number of office assistants in New Jersey is 128, and in Utah, it's 32. So, I need to find the overall mean salary across both offices. 

Hmm, I remember that to find the mean salary when there are two groups, I should calculate the total salary for each office and then add them together, and then divide by the total number of employees. That makes sense because the mean is the total divided by the number of items.

So first, let me calculate the total salary for New Jersey. That would be the mean salary multiplied by the number of assistants. So, 128 assistants times $28,500. Let me do that math: 128 * 28,500. Hmm, 128 times 28,500. Maybe I can break it down. 100 * 28,500 is 2,850,000. 28 * 28,500 is... let's see, 28 times 28,500. Wait, 28 is 20 + 8. 20 * 28,500 is 570,000, and 8 * 28,500 is 228,000. So adding those together, 570,000 + 228,000 = 798,000. So total is 2,850,000 + 798,000 = 3,648,000. Wait, no, that can't be right because 128 is 100 + 28, so 100*28,500=2,850,000 and 28*28,500=798,000, so total is 2,850,000 + 798,000 = 3,648,000. So New Jersey's total salary is $3,648,000.

Next, for Utah, the mean is $22,500 and the number of assistants is 32. So total salary is 32 * 22,500. Let me calculate that. 30 *22,500=675,000 and 2*22,500=45,000. So 675,000 +45,000=720,000. So Utah's total is $720,000.

Now, the combined total salary for both offices is 3,648,000 + 720,000. Let me add those. 3,648,000 +700,000 is 4,348,000, plus 20,000 is 4,368,000. So total salary is $4,368,000.

Now, the total number of employees is 128 + 32. Let's add those. 128+32=160. So there are 160 employees in total.

The overall mean salary is total salary divided by total employees. So 4,368,000 divided by 160. Let me compute that. 

Hmm, 4,368,000 รท 160. First, I can simplify this by dividing numerator and denominator by 10: 436,800 รท16. 

Wait, 16 * 27,000 is 432,000 because 16*27=432, so 16*27,000=432,000. Then 436,800 -432,000=4,800. Now, 4,800 รท16=300. So total is 27,000 +300=27,300.

Wait, that would make the mean $27,300. Let me double-check that because I might have made a mistake in calculation.

Alternatively, let me compute 4,368,000 รท160. Dividing step by step: 160 goes into 4,368,000 how many times?

Divide 4,368,000 by 160: Let's see, 160 *27,300 = 4,368,000 because 160*27,000=4,320,000 and 160*300=48,000, so 4,320,000 +48,000=4,368,000. So yes, 27,300 is correct.

Looking at the options, option H is $27,300. So that should be the correct answer.

To calculate the mean salary for all office assistants in the company, we first compute the total salary for each office and then find the overall mean.

**Step 1: Calculate total salary for New Jersey office**
\[
128 \text{ assistants} \times \$28,500 = \$3,648,000
\]

**Step 2: Calculate total salary for Utah office**
\[
32 \text{ assistants} \times \$22,500 = \$720,000
\]

**Step 3: Calculate combined total salary**
\[
\$3,648,000 + \$720,000 = \$4,368,000
\]

**Step 4: Calculate total number of employees**
\[
128 + 32 = 160 \text{ employees}
\]

**Step 5: Calculate overall mean salary**
\[
\frac{\$4,368,000}{160} = \$27,300
\]

**Answer:** H
