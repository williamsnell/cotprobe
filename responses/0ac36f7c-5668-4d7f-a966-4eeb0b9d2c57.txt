Question:

How are antibody producing cells stimulated?

Options:

A: Interacting with a virus short peptide
B: Interacting with a T helper cell.
C: Interacting with a plasma cell
D: Interacting with a virus infected cell

Answer:

Okay, so I've got this question about how antibody-producing cells are stimulated. Hmm, I remember from my immunology class that antibodies are made by certain cells, probably B cells or plasma cells. The question is asking about the stimulation process.

Let me think about the options. Option A says interacting with a virus short peptide. I think that's part of the antigen presentation, but does that directly stimulate the antibody-producing cells? Maybe that's more about how antigens are processed.

Option B is interacting with a T helper cell. Oh right, T helper cells are crucial in activating B cells. I remember that B cells present antigens to T cells, and the T cells then help activate the B cells to produce antibodies. So maybe this is the right one.

Option C is interacting with a plasma cell. Wait, plasma cells are the ones that actually produce antibodies. But do they stimulate each other? I don't think so. Plasma cells are the end effectors, so they're probably not the ones stimulating the production.

Option D is interacting with a virus-infected cell. That sounds like it's related to cytotoxic T cells, which kill infected cells. But for antibody production, I think it's more about the B cells getting the signal from T helpers.

So putting it together, the antibody-producing cells, which are likely B cells or plasma cells, get stimulated by T helper cells. So the correct answer should be B.

The correct answer is B: Interacting with a T helper cell. T helper cells play a crucial role in stimulating B cells to produce antibodies by providing necessary signals during the immune response.
