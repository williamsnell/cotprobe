Question:

A man and a woman agreed that the woman would rob a bank and that the man would steal a car beforehand for the woman to use as a getaway vehicle. The man stole a car and parked it two blocks from the bank. He left the car key under the floor mat with a note saying that he wanted nothing more to do with the scheme. The next day, the woman robbed the bank and ran to the spot where the man had said he would leave the stolen car. She then escaped in the car and disappeared. She never shared any of the money with the man. In a jurisdiction that has adopted the bilateral requirement for conspiracy, can the man properly be convicted of conspiring with the woman to rob the bank?

Options:

A: Yes, because the man was a part of the initial planning of the robbery.
B: Yes, because the man committed a crime (stealing a car) in furtherance of the conspiracy.
C: Yes, because the robbery was successful due in part to the man's actions.
D: Yes, because the man provided the getaway vehicle.
E: Yes, because there was an agreement to rob the bank and an overt act in furtherance of the agreement.
F: No, because the man expressed his intention to withdraw from the conspiracy.
G: No, because the man received no benefit from the robbery.
H: No, because the woman did not share the money with the man.
I: No, because the man did not participate in the actual robbery.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this law question about conspiracy. Okay, so the situation is a man and a woman agree that she'll rob a bank and he'll steal a car for her to use as a getaway. The man steals the car, parks it two blocks away, leaves the key under the mat, and leaves a note saying he wants nothing more to do with it. The next day, the woman robs the bank, goes to where the car was left, drives off, and disappears without sharing the money with the man. The question is whether the man can be convicted of conspiring with the woman to rob the bank, given that the jurisdiction follows the bilateral requirement for conspiracy.

Hmm, first, I need to remember what the bilateral requirement for conspiracy means. I think it means that for a conspiracy to exist, both the agreement and an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy must be present. So, both elements are necessary.

Now, the man and woman had an initial agreementâ€”so the agreement part is there. Then, the man stole the car, which was in furtherance of the conspiracy. Stealing a car as a getaway vehicle seems like an overt act. So, under the bilateral requirement, if both are present, he could be convicted.

Wait, but he left a note saying he wanted nothing more to do with it. Does that mean he withdrew from the conspiracy? I think withdrawal is possible if it's done before the commission of the crime and communicated to the co-conspirator. But did he do that effectively?

He left the car and the key, so maybe he tried to withdraw by making the car available but also tried to back out. But withdrawal requires more than just renouncing; it has to be an affirmative act to neutralize the conspiracy. Did he do that? He parked the car and left the key, which actually helped her commit the robbery. So maybe his withdrawal wasn't effective because he didn't take steps to prevent the crime, like reporting it or disabling the car. So his actions might still be considered part of the conspiracy.

Looking at the options, option F says no because he withdrew. But I'm not sure if his withdrawal was effective. The other options: E says yes because there was an agreement and an overt act. That seems to fit the bilateral requirement.

Wait, but the question is about whether he can be convicted. So, if the agreement was there and he did an overt act (stealing the car), even if he later tried to withdraw, unless his withdrawal was effective, he's still in the conspiracy. But withdrawal is a defense that can negate conspiracy if done before the crime and communicated. Did he communicate his withdrawal? Well, he left a note, but the woman didn't know about it because she went to the spot where he said he'd leave the car. So, she might not have known he withdrew. 

But the issue is whether his withdrawal was effective. If he made a bona fide effort to prevent the crime, but just leaving the car and key isn't enough. So, even if he intended to withdraw, his act of providing the car facilitated the crime, so the withdrawal might not be effective. Therefore, he's still part of the conspiracy.

So looking at the options, E seems correct because there was an agreement and an overt act. F is incorrect because his withdrawal wasn't effective. The other options don't fit as well. For example, D says yes because he provided the vehicle, but that's part of the overt act. But E covers both the agreement and the act.

The bilateral requirement for conspiracy requires both an agreement and an overt act in furtherance of the agreement. Here, the man and woman had an agreement to rob the bank, and the man stole a car as a getaway vehicle, which constitutes an overt act. The man's note expressing withdrawal may not be effective because he did not take affirmative steps to neutralize the conspiracy, such as disabling the car or reporting it. His actions facilitated the crime, making his withdrawal ineffective. Therefore, the man can be convicted of conspiracy.

Answer: E
