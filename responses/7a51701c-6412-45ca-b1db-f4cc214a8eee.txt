Okay, so I have this question about the in-basket technique and its use in personnel selection. Hmm, I remember that the in-basket technique is a method used in assessing candidates for management positions. It's a simulation where the candidate is given a variety of tasks, like handling different types of documents, memos, and problems that a manager might typically deal with. The idea is to see how well they can prioritize and manage their time, as well as make decisions under pressure.

The question is asking which type of employee this technique would be most likely used for. The options are from A to J, covering various roles like Financial, Customer Service, Technical, Sales, Marketing, Manufacturing, Managerial, Secretarial, Clerical, and Human Resources.

Wait, the in-basket technique is mainly used for evaluating managerial or supervisory candidates. Because managers are expected to handle multiple tasks, delegate, make decisions, and manage their time effectively. So the in-basket exercise would simulate a typical day's workload for a manager, allowing the assessors to evaluate the candidate's suitability for the managerial role.

Looking at the options, G is Managerial. That makes sense because the technique is designed to assess management skills. Other roles like Financial or Sales might require specific skills, but the in-basket is more about general management abilities.

So the answer should be G: Managerial.
