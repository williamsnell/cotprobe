Question:

The ABC Pencil Co. was considering a price increase and wished to determine the elasticity of demand. An economist and a market researcher, Key and Worce, were hired to study demand. In a controlled experiment, it was determined that at 8\textcent, 100 pencils were sold yielding an elasticity of 2.25. However, key and worce were industrial spies, employed by the EF Pencil Co. And sent to ABC to cause as much trouble as possible. So key and worce decided to change the base for their elasticity figure, measuring price in terms of dollars instead of pennies ( i.e., $.08 for 8\textcent and $.10 for 10\textcent ). How will this sabotage affect the results?

Options:

A: The calculated elasticity will appear much higher, misleading the company
B: The change in base will create an illusion of inelastic demand
C: The elasticity measure will decrease
D: The price point for maximum revenue will appear to change dramatically
E: Elasticity is independent of the unit of measurement employed.
F: The price-demand curve will shift to the right
G: The elasticity measure will increase
H: The calculated elasticity will seem artificially low, causing confusion in pricing strategy
I: The sabotage will significantly affect the results
J: The demand will seem more elastic than it actually is

Okay, so I've got this economics question here about price elasticity of demand. Hmm, I remember that elasticity measures how responsive the quantity demanded is to a change in price. The formula for price elasticity of demand (PED) is usually percentage change in quantity demanded divided by percentage change in price. Wait, no, I think it's the other way around: PED is (percentage change in quantity demanded) divided by (percentage change in price). So if the percentage change in quantity is higher than the percentage change in price, elasticity is greater than 1, meaning demand is elastic.

The question says that ABC Pencil Co. did a study where at 8 cents, 100 pencils were sold, and the elasticity was calculated as 2.25. So that's a high elasticity, meaning demand is elastic there. Now, Key and Worce, who are industrial spies, messed with the base for elasticity by measuring price in dollars instead of pennies. So instead of 8 cents, they used $0.08, and similar for other prices.

Wait, how does changing the unit of measurement affect elasticity? Let me think. Elasticity is a ratio of percentages, so it's unitless. Because you're taking the percentage change, which cancels out the units. So whether you measure price in dollars or cents, the percentage change should be the same, right? For example, if the price goes from 8 cents to 10 cents, that's a 25% increase (because 2/8 is 0.25). Similarly, if you measure in dollars, from $0.08 to $0.10, the absolute change is $0.02, so percentage change is (0.02/0.08)*100 = 25%, same as before. So the percentage change in price and quantity should be the same regardless of the unit used. Therefore, elasticity shouldn't change because the units are converted.

Wait, but the question says that Key and Worce changed the base for their elasticity figure, measuring price in dollars instead of pennies. So does that affect the calculation? Let's say the original experiment found an elasticity of 2.25 at 8 cents. If they redo the calculation using dollars, would the elasticity change?

Let me think of an example. Suppose the price increases from 8 cents to 10 cents. The percentage change in price is (2/8)*100 = 25%. If the quantity demanded decreases from 100 to, say, 80, then the percentage change in quantity is (20/100)*100 = 20%. So elasticity is 20/25 = 0.8, which is inelastic. Wait, but in the question, the elasticity is 2.25, which is elastic. So maybe in their case, when they changed the base, they might have messed up the calculation.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me take the given data. At 8 cents, 100 pencils are sold. Let's say they increased the price to, say, 10 cents, and sold fewer pencils. The elasticity was calculated as 2.25, which is elastic. Now, if they change the price to dollars, so 0.08 to 0.10. The percentage change in price is the same: (0.02 / 0.08)*100 = 25%. The quantity change, say from 100 to 80, is 20% decrease. So 20% divided by 25% is 0.8, which is inelastic. Wait, that's different. But in the question, the elasticity was 2.25, which is elastic. So maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the price change led to a larger percentage change in quantity. Let me recast it. Suppose the price increased from 8 cents to 10 cents, a 25% increase. If the quantity demanded decreased by 50%, then elasticity is 50 / 25 = 2, which is elastic. So the original elasticity is 2.25, which is higher than 2, so even more elastic.

Now, if they measure price in dollars, the change from $0.08 to $0.10 is still a $0.02 increase. The percentage change is (0.02 / 0.08) = 25%. The quantity change is the same. So the elasticity should still be the same. Because percentage changes are the same regardless of the unit. So the elasticity figure shouldn't change.

Wait, but the question says that Key and Worce changed the base, and this caused trouble. So maybe they messed up the calculation. For example, perhaps they forgot to convert the price properly. Alternatively, perhaps they used a different base period, leading to a wrong calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps they used the absolute change instead of percentage change. But no, elasticity is always based on percentages.

Wait, maybe the problem is that when they converted the price to dollars, they didn't adjust the quantity accordingly. But no, the quantity is in units of pencils, which doesn't depend on the price unit.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that when they converted the price to dollars, they thought the price change was smaller in absolute terms, but in percentage terms, it's the same. So the elasticity should remain the same. Therefore, the calculated elasticity shouldn't change. So the answer would be E: Elasticity is independent of the unit of measurement employed.

But wait, the question says that Key and Worce changed the base for their elasticity figure, measuring price in terms of dollars instead of pennies. So maybe they used the dollar amount but didn't adjust the calculation correctly. For example, perhaps they thought the price change was from $0.08 to $0.10, which is a $0.02 increase, but in terms of percentage, it's 25%. If they miscalculated the percentage change as (0.02 / 0.10)*100 = 20%, then the elasticity would be quantity change (say 20% decrease) divided by 20% price increase, giving 1.0. That would make it unitary elastic, which is different.

Wait, but the original calculation was 2.25. If they messed up and thought the price change was smaller, their percentage change in price would be wrong, leading to a different elasticity.

Alternatively, perhaps they confused the base year. For example, if they used the higher price as the base instead of the lower one. Let's say the price went from 8 cents to 10 cents. The percentage change is (10-8)/8 = 25%. If they used 10 cents as the base, the percentage change would be (10-8)/10 = 20%. So if they used 10 cents as the base, the price change would be 20% (from 8 to 10), and the quantity change is, say, 45% (since elasticity is 2.25). So 45% change in quantity over 20% change in price is 2.25. But if they used the wrong base, say, 8 cents as the base, they get 25% change in price. So if the elasticity was calculated as 2.25, that's correct. But if they used 10 as the base, they'd get 45% quantity change over 20% price change, which is still 2.25. So that doesn't change the elasticity.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The key point is that elasticity is a ratio of percentage changes, so it's unitless. Therefore, changing the unit of measurement for price (from cents to dollars) doesn't affect the elasticity value. So the answer should be E: Elasticity is independent of the unit of measurement employed.

But wait, the question says that Key and Worce changed the base, which might have caused them to miscalculate. So perhaps they thought the price change was smaller in dollar terms, leading to a lower percentage change, making the elasticity appear lower.

Wait, let's say the price increased by 2 cents, from 8 to 10 cents. In cents, that's 2/8 = 25% increase. In dollars, it's 0.02/0.08 = 25%. So same percentage. So the percentage change is the same, so elasticity remains the same.

So the correct answer is E: Elasticity is independent of the unit of measurement employed.

Wait, but the options include J: The demand will seem more elastic than it actually is. How? If they changed the base and miscalculated, perhaps they thought the price change was smaller, leading to a higher elasticity.

Wait, no, because percentage change is the same. So I think the answer is E.

The question revolves around how changing the unit of measurement for price affects the calculation of price elasticity of demand (PED). PED is a ratio of percentage changes, making it unitless and independent of the currency unit used (e.g., cents or dollars). Whether the price is measured in cents or dollars, the percentage change remains the same, as it is calculated relative to the base value. For example, a price increase from 8 cents to 10 cents (a 25% increase) is equivalent to a price increase from $0.08 to $0.10 (also a 25% increase). Consequently, the elasticity calculation remains unaffected by the change in unit, as the percentage changes in both price and quantity demanded determine elasticity.

Given this, the correct answer is:

E: Elasticity is independent of the unit of measurement employed.
