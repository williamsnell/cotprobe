Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about constructing a truth table for a given argument and then determining whether the argument is valid or invalid. If it's invalid, I need to pick the correct counterexample from the options provided.

The argument given is:
M ∨ N
~M · O / N

Hmm, I think I need to parse this correctly. So, the premises are "M or N" and "~M and O", and the conclusion is "N". So, the argument is saying that if either M or N is true, and if not M and O is true, then N must be true.

Wait, no, actually, in logic notation, the premises are connected, and the conclusion is separate. So the argument is: If (M ∨ N) and (~M · O), then N.

Wait, maybe I should write it as two premises leading to a conclusion. So the premises are M∨N and ~M·O, and the conclusion is N. So the argument is (M∨N) ∧ (~M·O) → N.

Wait, but maybe the way it's written is that the premises are M∨N and ~M·O, and the conclusion is N. So the argument is structured as two premises leading to a conclusion. So when both premises are true, does the conclusion necessarily hold?

To check validity, I need to see if in every case where the premises are true, the conclusion is also true. If there's even one case where the premises are true but the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid, and that case would be a counterexample.

So, the plan is to construct a truth table with all possible truth values for M, N, and O. Since there are three variables, there are 2^3 = 8 rows to consider.

Let me list all possible combinations of M, N, O:

1. M=T, N=T, O=T
2. M=T, N=T, O=F
3. M=T, N=F, O=T
4. M=T, N=F, O=F
5. M=F, N=T, O=T
6. M=F, N=T, O=F
7. M=F, N=F, O=T
8. M=F, N=F, O=F

For each row, I'll compute the truth values of the premises and the conclusion.

First, let's define the premises and conclusion:

Premise1: M∨N
Premise2: ~M ∧ O
Conclusion: N

The argument is Premise1 ∧ Premise2 → Conclusion.

Wait, but in logic, the argument's validity is determined by whether whenever both premises are true, the conclusion is also true. So, I can approach it by looking at all rows where both premises are true and check if the conclusion is true in those cases.

Alternatively, I can compute the entire truth table and look for any row where premises are true but conclusion is false.

Let's go row by row.

Row 1: M=T, N=T, O=T
Premise1: T∨T = T
Premise2: ~T ∧ T = F ∧ T = F
So both premises not true. So no issue here.

Row 2: M=T, N=T, O=F
Premise1: T∨T = T
Premise2: ~T ∧ F = F ∧ F = F
Again, premises not both true.

Row 3: M=T, N=F, O=T
Premise1: T∨F = T
Premise2: ~T ∧ T = F ∧ T = F
So premises not both true.

Row4: M=T, N=F, O=F
Premise1: T∨F = T
Premise2: ~T ∧ F = F ∧ F = F
No.

Row5: M=F, N=T, O=T
Premise1: F∨T = T
Premise2: ~F ∧ T = T ∧ T = T
So both premises true (Premise1=T, Premise2=T).
Conclusion: N=T
So when premises are true, conclusion is true. No problem here.

Row6: M=F, N=T, O=F
Premise1: F∨T = T
Premise2: ~F ∧ F = T ∧ F = F
So premises not both true.

Row7: M=F, N=F, O=T
Premise1: F∨F = F
Premise2: ~F ∧ T = T ∧ T = T
But Premise1 is F, so premises not both true.

Row8: M=F, N=F, O=F
Premise1: F∨F = F
Premise2: ~F ∧ F = T ∧ F = F
Premises not both true.

Wait, so in all the rows where both premises are true, the conclusion is also true. Because the only row where both premises are true is row5, where N is T. So the conclusion holds.

Wait, but that would mean the argument is valid. But the options include "Invalid" options. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I misread the premises. The argument is written as M∨N and ~M·O, leading to N. So the two premises are separate: M∨N and ~M·O. So the argument is: If (M∨N) is true and (~M·O) is true, then N must be true.

Wait, but perhaps the way it's written is that both premises are considered together, so the combined premise is (M∨N) ∧ (~M ∧ O). So whenever both M∨N and ~M·O are true, then N must be true.

Wait, but let me check row5 again: M=F, N=T, O=T. So M∨N is T, ~M is T, O=T, so ~M·O is T. So both premises are true, and N=T. So conclusion is T.

But are there any other rows where both premises are true?

Let me check again:

Looking for rows where both Premise1 (M∨N) is T and Premise2 (~M ∧ O) is T.

Premise2 is ~M ∧ O. So when is that true? When M is F and O is T.

So let's look for rows where M=F and O=T.

Rows where M=F and O=T are rows5 and row7.

Row5: M=F, N=T, O=T. Premise1: F∨T=T. So both premises are T. Conclusion is T.

Row7: M=F, N=F, O=T. Premise1: F∨F=F. So Premise1 is F, so premises not both true.

So the only row where both premises are true is row5, where conclusion is T.

So in all cases where both premises are true, conclusion is true. Therefore, the argument is valid, so the answer would be option A: Valid.

Wait, but the options include B, C, D as invalid with different counterexamples. So I must have made a mistake because the user is expecting an invalid argument.

Wait, perhaps I misread the premises. Let me check the original problem again.

The argument is written as:

M ∨ N
~M · O / N

So that's two premises: M∨N and ~M·O, leading to N.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the argument as: (M∨N) ∧ (~M ∧ O) → N.

Wait, but in that case, the only time both premises are true is when M=F, O=T, and N can be either T or F, but in our truth table, when M=F, O=T, N must be either T or F.

Wait, no, in our truth table, when M=F, O=T, N can be T or F. So let's see:

In row5, M=F, N=T, O=T: both premises are true, and conclusion is T.

In row7, M=F, N=F, O=T: Premise1 is F∨F=F, so premises not both true.

Wait, but no other rows have both premises true. So, in all cases where both premises are true, conclusion is true. Therefore, the argument is valid.

But the options include B, C, D as invalid. So perhaps I made a mistake in constructing the truth table.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the premises. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the argument is written as: If M∨N and ~M·O, then N.

But maybe the way the premises are connected is different. Alternatively, perhaps the argument is written in a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the premises are (M∨N) and (~M ∧ O), and the conclusion is N. So the argument is (M∨N) ∧ (~M ∧ O) → N.

Wait, but in that case, the only row where both premises are true is when M=F, O=T, and N can be either T or F. Wait, but in row5, N is T, so conclusion is T. But what if there's a row where M=F, O=T, and N=F? Then both premises would be true, but conclusion would be F, making the argument invalid.

Wait, but in our earlier analysis, in row7, M=F, N=F, O=T. So let's check that row again.

Row7: M=F, N=F, O=T.

Premise1: M∨N = F∨F = F.

Wait, no, that's not right. If M=F and N=F, then M∨N is F. So in row7, Premise1 is F, so both premises are not true. So only row5 has both premises true.

Wait, so perhaps there's no row where both premises are true and the conclusion is F. So the argument is valid.

But the options suggest that it's invalid, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I misread the premises. Let me check again.

The premises are:

1. M ∨ N
2. ~M · O

So, the argument is: (M∨N) ∧ (~M ∧ O) → N.

So, the conclusion is N.

So, to find if the argument is valid, we need to check if in every row where (M∨N) is T and (~M ∧ O) is T, then N is T.

So, let's find all rows where both premises are T.

Premise1: M∨N is T when at least one of M or N is T.

Premise2: ~M ∧ O is T only when M is F and O is T.

So, let's look for rows where M=F and O=T.

Rows where M=F and O=T: row5 (N=T) and row7 (N=F).

Wait, in row7: M=F, N=F, O=T.

So, in row7: Premise1 is M∨N = F∨F = F. So Premise1 is F, so both premises are not true. So row7 doesn't satisfy both premises.

Wait, so the only row where both premises are true is row5, where N=T, making the conclusion T.

So, in all cases where both premises are true, the conclusion is true. Hence, the argument is valid, so the answer is A: Valid.

But the options B, C, D suggest invalidity, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the premises. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the argument is written as (M∨N) ∧ (~M · O) → N. So, when both (M∨N) and (~M·O) are true, then N must be true.

Wait, but in the case where M=F, O=T, and N=F, then (M∨N) is F∨F=F, so the first premise is F, so both premises are not true. So the conclusion can be F in that case, but since the premises are not both true, it doesn't affect the validity.

Wait, but in the scenario where M=F, O=T, and N=F, the premises are not both true, so it's not a counterexample.

So, perhaps the argument is valid, so the answer is A.

But the options include B, C, D as invalid. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the premises.

Alternatively, perhaps the argument is structured differently. Let me parse the original argument again.

The original argument is written as:

M ∨ N
~M · O / N

So, perhaps the premises are M∨N and ~M·O, and the conclusion is N.

Wait, perhaps the argument is (M∨N) ∧ (~M·O) → N.

Wait, but in that case, the only time both premises are true is when M=F, O=T, and N can be either T or F. But in our truth table, when M=F, O=T, N can only be T or F based on the variables. So, in row5, N=T, and in row7, N=F, but in row7, M∨N=F, so the first premise is F, so both premises are not true.

Wait, so maybe the argument is actually valid because in the only case where both premises are true (row5), the conclusion is true.

So, the answer would be A: Valid.

But then why are the other options suggesting invalidity? Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the argument is written as (M∨N) ∧ (~M · O) → N. So, to find if this is a tautology, i.e., if whenever the antecedent is true, the consequent is true.

So, the antecedent is (M∨N) ∧ (~M ∧ O). So, let's see when this is true.

(M∨N) is true in all cases except when M=F and N=F.

(~M ∧ O) is true only when M=F and O=T.

So, the antecedent is true only when both (M∨N) is T and (~M ∧ O) is T. So, when M=F, O=T, and N can be T or F, but wait, when M=F and O=T, (M∨N) is T if N=T, but F if N=F.

Wait, so the antecedent is (M∨N) ∧ (~M ∧ O). So when M=F, O=T, and N=T, then (M∨N)=T, so antecedent is T, and conclusion N=T.

When M=F, O=T, and N=F, (M∨N)=F, so antecedent is F.

Thus, the only time the antecedent is T is when M=F, O=T, N=T. So in that case, conclusion is T.

Hence, in all cases where the antecedent is T, the conclusion is T. So the argument is valid.

Therefore, the answer is A: Valid.

But the options given include B, C, D as invalid, which suggests that perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the original problem is different.

Wait, perhaps the argument is written as (M∨N) → (~M · O) / N. No, that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps the premises are separate.

Wait, perhaps the argument is (M∨N) ∧ (~M ∧ O) → N.

Wait, but as we saw, the only time the antecedent is T is when M=F, O=T, and N=T. So conclusion is T.

So, the argument is valid. So the answer is A.

But the options don't have that as the case. Wait, looking back, the options are:

A: Valid
B: Invalid. Counterexample when M and O are true and N is false
C: Invalid. Counterexample when M is true and O and N are false
D: Invalid. Counterexample when O is true and M and N are false

Wait, but according to my analysis, the argument is valid, so the answer should be A. But perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the truth table. Let me try to construct the truth table more carefully.

Variables: M, N, O.

Let's list all 8 possible combinations:

1. M=T, N=T, O=T
2. M=T, N=T, O=F
3. M=T, N=F, O=T
4. M=T, N=F, O=F
5. M=F, N=T, O=T
6. M=F, N=T, O=F
7. M=F, N=F, O=T
8. M=F, N=F, O=F

Now, for each row, compute:

Premise1: M∨N
Premise2: ~M ∧ O
Conclusion: N

And then compute (Premise1 ∧ Premise2) → Conclusion.

We need to see if in any row where (Premise1 ∧ Premise2) is T, the Conclusion is F.

Let's go through each row.

Row1: M=T, N=T, O=T
Premise1: T∨T=T
Premise2: ~T ∧ T = F ∧ T = F
So, Premise1 ∧ Premise2 = T ∧ F = F
Conclusion: T
So, F → T is T. No problem.

Row2: M=T, N=T, O=F
Premise1: T∨T=T
Premise2: ~T ∧ F = F ∧ F = F
Premise1 ∧ Premise2 = F
Conclusion: T
F→T=T

Row3: M=T, N=F, O=T
Premise1: T∨F=T
Premise2: ~T ∧ T = F ∧ T = F
Premise1 ∧ Premise2 = F
Conclusion: F
F→F=T

Row4: M=T, N=F, O=F
Premise1: T∨F=T
Premise2: ~T ∧ F = F ∧ F = F
Premise1 ∧ Premise2 = F
Conclusion: F
F→F=T

Row5: M=F, N=T, O=T
Premise1: F∨T=T
Premise2: ~F ∧ T = T ∧ T = T
Premise1 ∧ Premise2 = T
Conclusion: T
T→T=T

Row6: M=F, N=T, O=F
Premise1: F∨T=T
Premise2: ~F ∧ F = T ∧ F = F
Premise1 ∧ Premise2 = F
Conclusion: T
F→T=T

Row7: M=F, N=F, O=T
Premise1: F∨F=F
Premise2: ~F ∧ T = T ∧ T = T
Premise1 ∧ Premise2 = F ∧ T = F
Conclusion: F
F→F=T

Row8: M=F, N=F, O=F
Premise1: F∨F=F
Premise2: ~F ∧ F = T ∧ F = F
Premise1 ∧ Premise2 = F
Conclusion: F
F→F=T

So, in all rows, whenever Premise1 ∧ Premise2 is T (only row5), the conclusion is T. Therefore, the argument is valid. So the answer is A.

But the options include B, C, D as invalid. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the question, or I'm misunderstanding it.

Wait, perhaps the argument is written differently. Let me check the original problem again.

The argument is:

M ∨ N
~M · O / N

So, perhaps the premises are (M∨N) and (~M ∧ O), and the conclusion is N.

So, the argument is (M∨N) ∧ (~M ∧ O) → N.

In that case, as we saw, the argument is valid, so the answer is A.

But the options suggest that B, C, D are invalid. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the argument is written as (M∨N) → (~M · O) / N, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the premises are separate, and the conclusion is N.

Wait, perhaps the argument is that from (M∨N) and (~M ∧ O), we can conclude N.

In that case, the premises are both true only in row5, where N=T, so conclusion is T. So the argument is valid.

Thus, the answer is A: Valid.

But the options given don't align with that. Wait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it.

Alternatively, perhaps the argument is (M∨N) ∧ (~M · O) → N, and we have to find if it's a tautology. But since in all cases where the antecedent is T, the conclusion is T, the argument is valid, so the answer is A.

But the options don't have that, so perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the argument is invalid, and I need to find a counterexample.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the argument as (M∨N) ∧ (~M ∧ O) → N, and check if it's a tautology.

In the truth table, the only row where the antecedent is T is row5, where conclusion is T. So no counterexample exists, so the argument is valid.

Therefore, the correct answer is A: Valid.
</think>

The argument is valid because in every case where both premises are true, the conclusion is also true. The only row where both premises are true is when M=F, O=T, and N=T, making the conclusion true.

Answer:
A: Valid
