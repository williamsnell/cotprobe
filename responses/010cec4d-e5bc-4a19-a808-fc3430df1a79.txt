Question:

A defendant, a nurse at a nursing home, is charged with murdering a resident at the home by adding an allegedly lethal substance to the resident's food. At trial, to prove that the substance added to the resident's food could result in death, the prosecutor, without first calling any witnesses, offers to read into evidence several pages from a standard medical treatise that support the prosecution's claim that the substance the defendant added to the food is lethal. Is the evidence offered admissible?

Options:

A: Yes, because the lethal nature of the substance is relevant to the defendant's state of mind and intent.
B: Yes, because the treatise is a public document and therefore exempt from the hearsay rule.
C: No, because the treatise itself must be introduced as an exhibit.
D: Yes, because the prosecutor is allowed to introduce evidence without calling witnesses.
E: No, because the treatise excerpts are considered hearsay and do not qualify for an exception.
F: Yes, although hearsay, under the learned treatise exception to the hearsay rule.
G: Yes, because the prosecution is merely providing evidence that supports their claim.
H: No, because the treatise excerpts were not offered during the examination of a qualified expert.
I: No, because the substance's lethal nature is not relevant to the case.

Alright, so I have this question about evidence law, specifically about whether certain medical treatise excerpts are admissible in court. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The defendant is a nurse charged with murder by allegedly adding a lethal substance to a resident's food. The prosecutor wants to read from a standard medical treatise without calling any witnesses. The question is whether this evidence is admissible.

First, I need to understand the basics of evidence admissibility. In criminal trials, evidence must be both relevant and not excluded by the rules of evidence. Here, the key issue is hearsay. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Generally, hearsay is inadmissible unless there's an exception.

The treatise excerpts are written by someone else and offered to prove that the substance is lethal. So, the prosecutor is trying to use these excerpts as evidence of the substance's lethality. Since the treatise isn't being offered through a witness (like an expert), it's likely being offered directly as evidence, which raises hearsay issues.

I remember that there's a hearsay exception for learned treatises. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 803(18), a treatise can be admitted if it's a recognized authority on a subject and the matter is within the scope of the treatise. The catch is that the treatise must be offered on the subject of an expert's testimony. But wait, in this case, the prosecutor hasn't called an expert witness. They're just offering the treatise excerpts directly.

So, the problem is that the learned treatise exception typically applies when an expert is testifying, and the treatise is used to support their opinion. If there's no expert, can the treatise still be admitted? I think the exception requires the treatise to be offered during the examination of an expert. If the prosecutor isn't presenting an expert, then maybe the exception doesn't apply.

Looking at the options:

Option F says yes because it's a learned treatise exception. But wait, without an expert, does that exception still hold? I'm not sure. I think the learned treatise exception requires that the expert's testimony is based on it. If the prosecutor isn't presenting an expert, maybe they can't use this exception.

Option E says no because it's hearsay and doesn't qualify. That makes sense because without an expert, the exception might not apply. So the treatise would be inadmissible hearsay.

Other options: Option A talks about relevance to state of mind. While the lethal nature is relevant, the issue is whether the evidence is admissible, not just relevance. So even if relevant, it's still hearsay unless an exception applies.

Option H says no because the treatise wasn't offered during expert examination. That aligns with what I was thinking earlier. The exception requires the treatise to be used in the context of an expert's testimony.

Wait, but sometimes I've heard that the treatise can be used by the party without an expert if it's a recognized authority. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. Rule 803(18) says the treatise can be used if the matter is within the scope of the treatise and the subject is one on which the treatise is considered authoritative. But it doesn't explicitly say it requires an expert. However, the Advisory Committee Notes mention that it's for the purpose of supporting an expert's testimony. So without an expert, maybe it's not admissible.

So, the correct answer would be E or H. Option E says the excerpts are hearsay without exception. Option H says it's not admissible because it wasn't offered during expert testimony.

Wait, the question is whether the evidence is admissible when the prosecutor offers to read the excerpts without calling any witnesses. So, if the prosecutor isn't using an expert, then the exception doesn't apply. Therefore, the treatise is inadmissible as hearsay.

So, the answer is E or H. Which is correct?

Option E: No, because the excerpts are hearsay and don't qualify for an exception.

Option H: No, because the excerpts weren't offered during expert examination.

Both seem plausible. But under Rule 803(18), the requirement is that the treatise is offered on the subject of an expert's testimony. If there's no expert, the exception doesn't apply.

So, the correct answer would be E: the evidence is inadmissible as hearsay without an exception.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Some sources say that a party can offer a learned treatise without an expert if it's a recognized authority. But I think the rule specifically requires it to be offered during expert testimony. So without an expert, it's not admissible.

Therefore, the answer is E.

The question revolves around the admissibility of medical treatise excerpts offered by the prosecutor without calling any witnesses. The key issue is whether these excerpts qualify under a hearsay exception, specifically the learned treatise exception. 

Under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(18), the learned treatise exception allows a treatise to be admitted if it is a recognized authority on a subject and the matter is within the scope of the treatise. However, the exception typically applies when the treatise is used to support an expert's testimony. In this case, the prosecutor is not presenting an expert witness, which raises the question of whether the exception still applies.

Option F suggests that the exception applies, but this is incorrect because the exception generally requires the treatise to be used in the context of expert testimony. Without an expert, the exception does not apply. Therefore, the treatise excerpts are inadmissible as hearsay without an applicable exception.

The correct answer is E: No, because the treatise excerpts are considered hearsay and do not qualify for an exception.

Answer: E
