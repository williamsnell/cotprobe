Question:

A dance student worked very hard to strengthen her legs, including performing additional activities such as leaping and bounding up multiple flights of stairs in her apartment building. While she was performing her exercises, one of the janitors in the building warned her that "she was bound to get hurt if she keeps it up, because there are problems with the floor." After falling and breaking a leg due to a loose floorboard, she brought suit against the building owner. The building owner wants to testify that: "The janitor told me 'I told her that running too fast is dangerous and she was bound to get hurt.' ". Is the building owner's statement likely to be held admissible?

Options:

A: No, because it is hearsay, the janitor's statement is not a public record.
B: Yes, because it is an exception to hearsay as a recorded recollection.
C: Yes, because it is an exception to hearsay as a statement made for medical diagnosis or treatment.
D: Yes, because it is as an exception to hearsay as a spontaneous declaration to an opponent-party.
E: No, because it is hearsay and the building owner is not a credible source.
F: Yes, because it is an exception to hearsay as a statement of then-existing mental, emotional, or physical condition.
G: No, because it is hearsay within hearsay, and there are no hearsay exceptions that apply.
H: Yes, because the building owner can testify and be questioned about what the janitor told him.
I: No, because it is irrelevant and immaterial.
J: No, because it is hearsay and there are no exceptions that would allow for the janitor's statement to be admissible.

Okay, so I've got this question about evidence law, specifically about hearsay exceptions. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The scenario is a dance student who was injured because of a loose floorboard. She sued the building owner. Now, the building owner wants to testify about what the janitor told him. The janitor had previously warned the student, saying she'd get hurt if she kept up with her exercises, because there were problems with the floor. Now, the building owner is trying to say that the janitor told him, "I told her that running too fast is dangerous and she was bound to get hurt." 

The question is whether this statement is admissible. The options are from A to J, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So, if the building owner is testifying about what the janitor said, that's hearsay unless an exception applies.

Looking at the options, several involve exceptions to hearsay. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A says it's hearsay and not a public record. Public records are an exception, but the janitor's statement doesn't seem to be a public record. So A might be correct, but let me check other options.

Option B suggests it's a recorded recollection exception. That exception applies when a party's agent (like an employee) makes a statement recorded in a record kept in the regular course of business. But here, the janitor's statement to the building owner might not be in a business record unless it was recorded as part of the building's maintenance logs. If the building owner is just testifying from memory about what the janitor said, it's not a recorded recollection. So B might not apply.

Option C is about medical diagnosis or treatment. That exception allows statements made to a medical professional for diagnosis or treatment. The janitor's warning doesn't seem related to medical treatment, so C is probably not applicable.

Option D says it's a spontaneous declaration to an opponent-party. Spontaneous declarations are exceptions when the statement is made under the stress of the event. Here, the janitor's statement was a warning, but the building owner is the party against whom the statement is being offered. Wait, the opponent-party exception typically applies when the statement is made to the opposing party during the litigation, like in a statement against interest. I'm not sure if this fits because the janitor isn't a party, and the statement was made before the injury. Maybe D isn't correct.

Option E claims it's hearsay and the source isn't credible. But credibility goes to weight, not admissibility. So even if the janitor isn't credible, the statement is still hearsay unless an exception applies. So E might not be the right reason for inadmissibility.

Option F is about a statement of then-existing mental, emotional, or physical condition. That exception allows statements like "I feel sick" because they describe a current state. The janitor's statement here is more about predicting danger, not describing his own condition. So F probably doesn't apply.

Option G says it's hearsay within hearsay with no exceptions. The building owner is testifying about the janitor's statement, which is hearsay. But the statement itself doesn't contain another layer of hearsay. So G might not apply unless there's another hearsay within hearsay issue, which I don't think there is here.

Option H suggests the owner can testify and be questioned about the janitor's statement. That sounds like it's allowing the statement as an admission, but I'm not sure. Wait, the building owner is not a party; the party is the owner. Wait, the building owner is the defendant. So the janitor's statement would be a statement by a non-party. Unless the janitor is an agent of the building owner, but even then, the exception for admissions applies to statements by a party's agent. But the janitor's statement was made to the building owner, so maybe it's considered an admission by a party-opponent. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, statements by a party's agent are admissible if they are made during the employment and concern a matter within the agent's authority. So if the janitor was employed to maintain the floors, his warning could be an admission. That might make H correct, but wait, the option says the owner can testify and be questioned, which sounds like they're offering the janitor's statement as an admission, so it would be admissible. But I'm a bit confused because the building owner is testifying about what the janitor told him, which could be an admission by a party-opponent.

Wait, but the building owner is the defendant, and the janitor works for the building owner. So the janitor is an agent of the defendant. If the janitor's statement was made within the scope of his employment, it would be an admission by a party-opponent, making it admissible. So under FRE 801(d)(2)(D), a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against an opposing party and was made by the party's agent or employee on a matter within the scope of that relationship and while it existed. So the janitor's warning about the floor problem would likely qualify as an admission, making the statement admissible.

But option H says the owner can testify and be questioned about what the janitor told him. That seems to be about whether the statement is admissible as an admission, which would make H correct. But I'm a bit tangled here because the building owner is testifying about the janitor's statement, which would be an admission, so the statement is not hearsay. So the statement is admissible because it's an admission by a party-opponent.

Wait, but the options don't directly say that. Option D was about spontaneous declaration, which I don't think applies. Option H is about whether the owner can testify and be questioned about the janitor's statement. But the main issue is whether the statement is admissible as an exception.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The building owner is trying to admit the janitor's statement. The janitor is an employee, so the statement is an admission. Therefore, it's not hearsay and is admissible. So the correct answer would be H because the building owner can testify about the janitor's statement as an admission.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option H says "Yes, because the building owner can testify and be questioned about what the janitor told him." That seems to suggest that the statement is admissible as an admission, which would be correct. But let me check other options. Option J says it's hearsay with no exceptions. But if it's an admission, it's not hearsay. So J would be incorrect.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, the building owner is offering the janitor's statement as part of his testimony. The janitor's statement is about warning the student, not about the condition of the floor. Wait, no, the statement is that the janitor told the building owner that he told the student she was bound to get hurt. So the statement is about the janitor's warning to the student, not about the floor condition. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the janitor told the dance student that she was bound to get hurt because of the floor problems. Then, the janitor told the building owner, "I told her that running too fast is dangerous and she was bound to get hurt." So the building owner is testifying about the janitor's statement to him.

Now, the question is whether that statement is admissible. The statement is about the janitor warning the student. The building owner is trying to use this to show that he knew about the danger, perhaps.

But the key is, is the janitor's statement to the building owner an admission by a party-opponent? Since the janitor works for the building owner, and the statement was made in the course of his duties, it's likely an admission. Therefore, it's not hearsay and is admissible.

So looking at the options, which one aligns with this reasoning? Option H says yes because the building owner can testify and be questioned about the janitor's statement. That sounds correct because the statement is an admission by a party-opponent.

Alternatively, option D mentions a spontaneous declaration, but that's not the case here. The janitor's statement to the building owner isn't a spontaneous declaration because it's not made under the stress of the event; it's a later report.

So I think the correct answer is H. But wait, earlier I thought about whether it's an admission. So the statement is being offered by the building owner, who is the party against whom the statement is being used. So the statement is an admission, making it non-hearsay.

But looking at the options, H says yes because the owner can testify and be questioned. So the statement is admissible as an admission. Therefore, the correct answer is H.
</think>

The building owner's testimony about the janitor's statement is admissible because the janitor, as an employee, made the statement within the scope of his employment, qualifying it as an admission by a party-opponent under the Federal Rules of Evidence. This makes the statement non-hearsay and admissible. 

Answer: H
