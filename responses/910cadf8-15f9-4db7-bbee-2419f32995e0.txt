Question:

A 12-year-old boy decided to play a practical joke. Knowing that his parents were giving a dinner party that evening, the boy filled a bucket with ice-cold water and balanced it on the partially open door of the guest bedroom, thinking that his father would take the guests' coats there to put them on the bed. The boy then went off to play at a friend's house. The boy's father decided to keep all the guests' coats in the hall closet instead of putting them in the guest bedroom. Later that evening, one of the guests mistakenly wandered into the guest bedroom while searching for a bathroom. As the guest opened the door, the bucket fell and hit his head, causing a severe cut that required a dozen stitches. If the guest sues the boy for negligence, the most likely result is

Options:

A: the boy loses, because this "practical joke" posed a risk of severe harm and, therefore, the boy had a duty to exercise as much care as a reasonable adult.
B: the boy wins, because a child's conduct cannot be negligent.
C: the boy loses, because he did not act with the amount of care that one would expect from a 12-year-old child.
D: the boy wins, because he could not foresee that a guest would mistakenly enter the guest bedroom.
E: the boy wins, because he did not expect anyone to enter the guest bedroom.
F: the boy loses, as he left the house without removing the trap, knowing his parents were having guests over.
G: the boy wins, because the guest should have been more careful in an unfamiliar house.
H: the boy wins, because the guest unreasonably assumed the risk of entering an unfamiliar room rather than asking for directions to the bathroom.
I: the boy loses, because he intentionally set a trap that could potentially cause harm.

Okay, so I have this question about negligence law, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me walk through my thoughts step by step.

The scenario is about a 12-year-old boy who set up a practical joke. He filled a bucket with ice-cold water and balanced it on the partially open door of the guest bedroom. His intention was that his father would take the guests' coats there. But his father ended up storing the coats in the hall closet instead. Later, a guest wandered into the guest bedroom looking for the bathroom, opened the door, and the bucket fell, hitting his head and requiring stitches.

The question is whether the guest can successfully sue the boy for negligence, and what the outcome would be. The options are A through I, each giving a different reasoning.

First, I need to recall the elements of negligence. Negligence requires four main things: duty, breach, causation, and damages. So, the guest would need to prove that the boy owed a duty of care, that the boy breached that duty, that the breach caused the guest's injury, and that the guest suffered damages (which they did with the injury).

Now, considering the boy's age: he's 12. In tort law, especially for children, there's a concept of "tender years" where a child's capacity to understand the risks is considered. The standard for negligence in children is usually what a reasonable child of similar age and experience would do. So, the duty and standard of care are lower than that of an adult.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the boy loses because the joke posed a risk of severe harm, so he had a duty to act as a reasonable adult. That seems incorrect because children aren't held to the same standard as adults. The duty is based on what a child would reasonably do, not an adult.

Option B says the boy wins because a child's conduct can't be negligent. That's not entirely right. Children can be negligent; it's just that their standard is lower. So the outcome isn't automatic.

Option C states the boy loses because he didn't act with the care expected of a 12-year-old. This seems plausible. If the boy's actions were beyond what a reasonable 12-year-old would do, he could be found negligent.

Option D says the boy wins because he couldn't foresee a guest entering the room. But foreseeability is part of determining duty. If it was foreseeable that someone might enter the room, then the duty arises. A guest looking for the bathroom might wander into the bedroom, so the boy could have foreseen that.

Option E suggests the boy wins because he didn't expect anyone to enter. But expectation isn't the same as foreseeability. Even if he didn't expect it, if a reasonable person would have foreseen it, that could still establish duty.

Option F claims the boy loses for leaving the trap knowing there were guests. The key is whether his action was negligent. He left the house, but he set the trap before leaving. The father changed where the coats went, but that doesn't negate the risk created by the bucket.

Option G says the guest should have been more careful. That goes into contributory negligence or assumption of risk. But in many jurisdictions, even if the guest was negligent, it doesn't completely bar recovery unless comparative negligence applies, and the question doesn't mention that.

Option H states the guest assumed the risk. Assumption of risk is when the injured party willingly took on the risk. Here, the guest was looking for the bathroom, so it's more about whether they were careful, but not necessarily assuming the risk of a bucket trap.

Option I says the boy loses because he intentionally set a trap that could cause harm. Intentional torts require intent to cause harm or reckless disregard. The boy's intent was a prank, but if he didn't intend harm, it's negligence, not intentional tort. But the option here is about setting a trap that could cause harm, which might point towards intentional, but the question is framed as negligence.

Back to the main issue: duty and standard of care. The boy's actions could be seen as creating a foreseeable risk. A reasonable 12-year-old might not set up a trap in a way that could harm guests. If the boy's action was such that a reasonable child would have foreseen the risk, then he breached his duty.

So, looking at the options, option C says the boy loses because he didn't act with the care expected of a 12-year-old. That makes sense because the duty is based on the child's standard, not an adult's. If his action was beyond that, he breached.

Option I is about intentional setting, but the question is about negligence, so I think I is more about intent, which might not fit here.

So, the most likely outcome is that the boy loses because he didn't meet the standard of care expected of a 12-year-old, making option C correct.

The question revolves around whether a 12-year-old boy can be held negligent for setting up a practical joke that resulted in injury to a guest. The analysis focuses on the elements of negligence: duty, breach, causation, and damages. The key consideration is the standard of care expected of a child, which is lower than that of an adult. The boy's actions, involving a foreseeable risk, could be seen as a breach of duty if they fell below what a reasonable child would do. The most likely outcome is that the boy loses because he did not act with the care expected of a 12-year-old.
