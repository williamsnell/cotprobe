<think>
Okay, so I've got this transformer problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on transformers, but I'll do my best.

The problem gives me a 10 kVA transformer with a rating of 2300/230 volts and 60 cycles per second. The tests provided include open-circuit, short-circuit, and ohmic resistance tests. I need to find the efficiency under two different operating conditions: (a) rated kVA at power factor (pf) 1, and (b) half the rated kVA at pf 0.6 lead.

First, I should recall the basic formulas related to transformer efficiency. Efficiency is given by the ratio of the output power to the input power, considering both the iron losses and the copper losses.

Efficiency η = (Output Power) / (Input Power) × 100%

The input power is the sum of the iron losses (which are constant) and the copper losses (which depend on the current).

The iron losses (PFe) can be found from the open-circuit test. The open-circuit test gives the no-load losses, which are mainly the iron losses. In the open-circuit test, the input voltage is applied to the low side, so the power measured is P_fe = 69 watts, as given.

The copper losses (P_cu) are calculated from the short-circuit test. The short-circuit test is done on the high side, so the input voltage is 127 V, current is 4.9 A, and power is 263 W. Since copper losses depend on the square of the current, and since the test is on the high side, I need to relate the current to the low side.

Wait, wait. Let me think about this. The transformer has a turns ratio. The open-circuit test is with 230 V on the low side, and the short-circuit test is with 127 V on the high side. So, the turns ratio (a) is V_high / V_low = 2300 / 230 = 10. So, a = 10. That means the high side has 10 times more turns than the low side.

So, in the short-circuit test, the input is to the high side. The current drawn is 4.9 A. But when operating under normal conditions, the current on the high side would be much lower because the voltage is higher. Wait, no. Actually, during the short-circuit test, the secondary is shorted, so the current is determined by the primary's applied voltage and the leakage reactance. But since we're given the short-circuit test parameters, we can find the copper losses.

Wait, but the copper losses are the same regardless of the side if we account for the turns ratio. So, when the short-circuit test is done on the high side, the current is 4.9 A. The equivalent current on the low side would be I_sc,low = I_sc,high × a = 4.9 × 10 = 49 A. Wait, no, wait: current on the low side is I2, and I1 (high side) is I2 / a. So, if the high side current is 4.9 A, then the low side current would be 4.9 × a = 4.9 × 10 = 49 A.

But wait, the copper losses are the same whether calculated on the high side or low side, but scaled by the turns ratio. So, the copper loss on the high side would be I1² R1, and on the low side, I2² R2. Since R2 = a² R1, because resistance scales with the square of the turns ratio. So, R1 = V_sc² / (I_sc²) = (127)^2 / (4.9)^2 ≈ (16129)/(24.01) ≈ 672.4 ohms. Alternatively, on the low side, the current is 49 A, so R2 = (230)^2 / (49)^2 ≈ (52900)/(2401) ≈ 21.99 ohms. But R1 = a² R2 = 100 * 21.99 ≈ 2199 ohms? Wait, that can't be right because the short-circuit test gives us R1 as 672 ohms. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the copper losses using the short-circuit test as given. The short-circuit test is done on the high side, so the copper loss at full load would be I² R, but I need to make sure I'm using the correct current.

Wait, the short-circuit test gives the copper losses when the transformer is shorted on the low side. So, when the test is performed on the high side, the current is 4.9 A, and the voltage is 127 V. The copper loss would be I² R. But since it's a short circuit on the low side, the current would be higher if it were on the low side. Alternatively, perhaps the copper losses can be calculated directly from the test data.

Wait, the short-circuit test data given is: input to high side is 127 V, current 4.9 A, power 263 W. So, the copper losses at full load (when the low side is shorted) are 263 W. Because in the short-circuit test, the entire input power is the copper loss, as the core losses are negligible compared to copper losses.

So, P_cu_full = 263 W.

But wait, that's when the transformer is shorted on the low side, which is the same as the rated current. So, the copper losses at full load (maximum current) are 263 W.

Wait, but in the problem, the rated current on the low side is I2 = (10 kVA) / (230 V) = 43.478 A. So, I2_rated = 4.35 A on the high side? Wait, no: wait, the transformer is 10 kVA, 2300/230 V. So, the high side is 2300 V, low side 230 V.

At full load, the current on the low side is I2 = 10,000 / 230 ≈ 43.478 A. The current on the high side would be I1 = I2 / a = 43.478 / 10 = 4.3478 A, which matches the given I2’_rated = 4.35 A.

So, during the short-circuit test, when the low side is shorted, the high side current is 4.9 A, which is a bit higher than the rated current of 4.35 A. Hmm, that might indicate some reactance in the test, but perhaps for the purpose of this problem, the copper loss at full load is 263 W.

Wait, but the short-circuit test is done by applying 127 V to the high side, resulting in 4.9 A and 263 W. So, that would correspond to the copper loss at a current higher than the rated current. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the short-circuit test's copper loss is the total copper loss at full load. Because when the low side is shorted, the current is the maximum, so the copper loss would be maximum.

But the short-circuit test is done on the high side, so the current is 4.9 A, which would correspond to the high side current. But the rated current on the high side is 4.35 A. So, perhaps the short-circuit current is higher than the rated current, which would mean that the copper loss at short circuit is higher than the rated copper loss.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The copper loss at full load (I2 = 43.48 A on low side) is I2² R2. From the short-circuit test, when the low side is shorted, the current is I2_sc = a * I1_sc = 10 * 4.9 = 49 A. So, I2_sc = 49 A. Therefore, R2 = V2_sc² / I2_sc² = (230)^2 / (49)^2 ≈ 52900 / 2401 ≈ 21.99 ohms. So, R2 ≈ 22 ohms.

Then, the copper loss at full load (I2 = 43.48 A) would be I2² R2 = (43.48)^2 * 22 ≈ (1890) * 22 ≈ 41,580 W. Wait, that can't be right because 41,580 W is way higher than the 10 kVA transformer's rating. That can't be correct because the total losses can't exceed the transformer's capacity. So, I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, wait. Maybe the short-circuit test is done on the high side with 127 V applied, so the voltage drop is 127 V. The current is 4.9 A, so the copper loss is I² R = (4.9)^2 * R1, where R1 is the high-side resistance. So, R1 = V / I = 127 V / 4.9 A ≈ 25.92 ohms.

But since the high side has a turns ratio of 10, the low side resistance R2 would be R1 / (a²) = 25.92 / 100 ≈ 0.2592 ohms. Then, at full load, I2 = 43.48 A, so copper loss is I2² R2 = (43.48)^2 * 0.2592 ≈ (1890) * 0.2592 ≈ 490 W. Hmm, that makes more sense. So, the copper loss at full load is about 490 W.

Wait, but the short-circuit test gave a power of 263 W. So, perhaps the copper loss at the short-circuit test is 263 W, which is when the current is 4.9 A on the high side. So, maybe that's the copper loss when the high side current is 4.9 A. But the rated current on the high side is 4.35 A. So, perhaps the copper loss at rated load is (4.35/4.9)^2 * 263 W.

Because copper losses are proportional to the square of the current. So, (I_rated / I_sc)^2 * P_cu_sc.

So, (4.35 / 4.9)^2 ≈ (0.8878)^2 ≈ 0.788. So, P_cu_rated = 0.788 * 263 ≈ 207 W.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated using R2, I got about 490 W. There's a discrepancy here. I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify.

In the short-circuit test, the transformer is shorted on the low side, and the input is applied to the high side. The current in the high side is 4.9 A, and the power is 263 W, which is the copper loss. So, P_cu_sc = 263 W.

But the copper loss at rated load (I1 = 4.35 A) would be less than that because the current is lower. So, P_cu_rated = (I1_rated / I1_sc)^2 * P_cu_sc.

So, (4.35 / 4.9)^2 = (approx 0.8878)^2 ≈ 0.788. So, P_cu_rated = 0.788 * 263 ≈ 207 W.

But wait, when the low side is shorted, the current is higher than the rated current, so the copper loss is higher. So, at full load (I2_rated), the copper loss would be less than the short-circuit loss, which is when I2 is higher.

So, P_cu_rated = (I2_rated / I2_sc)² * P_cu_sc.

Wait, I2_sc is the current on the low side during the short-circuit test. Since the short-circuit test is done on the high side, the current on the low side is I2_sc = a * I1_sc = 10 * 4.9 = 49 A. So, I2_sc = 49 A.

Then, the copper loss at rated I2 (43.48 A) would be (43.48 / 49)^2 * 263 W.

Calculating that: (43.48 / 49) ≈ 0.8878, squared is 0.788. So, 0.788 * 263 ≈ 207 W. So, P_cu_rated ≈ 207 W.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated using R2, I got 490 W, which doesn't match. So, perhaps I made a mistake in that approach. Let me see: R1 is the high-side resistance, which is V_sc / I_sc = 127 V / 4.9 A ≈ 25.92 ohms. Then, R2 = R1 / a² = 25.92 / 100 ≈ 0.2592 ohms.

At rated current on the low side, I2 = 43.48 A, so copper loss is I2² R2 = (43.48)^2 * 0.2592 ≈ 1890 * 0.2592 ≈ 490 W. But this contradicts the earlier calculation.

Wait, but the short-circuit test gives P_cu_sc = 263 W when the high side current is 4.9 A. So, using R1: P_cu_sc = I1² R1 = (4.9)^2 * 25.92 ≈ 24 * 25.92 ≈ 622 W. But that's not matching the given 263 W. So, that's a problem. So, perhaps the approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the power in the short-circuit test is given as 263 W, which includes only the copper loss. So, P_cu_sc = 263 W. Then, using that, and knowing that the copper loss is proportional to I², we can find the copper loss at any current.

So, for part (a), when the transformer is operated at rated kVA (10 kVA) at pf=1, which means it's operating at full load with unity power factor.

At this condition, the current on the low side is I2 = 43.48 A, and on the high side, I1 = 4.35 A.

The copper loss at this load is P_cu = (I1 / I1_sc)^2 * P_cu_sc.

So, (4.35 / 4.9)^2 ≈ 0.788. So, P_cu = 0.788 * 263 ≈ 207 W.

The iron loss (P_fe) is given as 69 W from the open-circuit test, which is constant and doesn't depend on the load.

So, total input power at rated load is P_in = P_fe + P_cu = 69 + 207 = 276 W.

The output power is 10 kVA (since pf=1), which is 10,000 W.

Wait, wait. That can't be right because 10,000 W output would require an input power of 10,000 + losses, which would be way higher than 276 W. So, I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, I think I'm confusing the units. The open-circuit test gives P_fe as 69 W, which is the core loss (iron loss). The short-circuit test gives P_cu_sc as 263 W, which is the copper loss when the transformer is shorted on the low side, i.e., at maximum current.

But when the transformer is operating at full load, the copper loss is less than the short-circuit loss because the current is lower.

Wait, but the input power at full load would be much higher than the losses. Because the transformer is 10 kVA, so the output is 10 kVA at pf=1, which is 10,000 W. The input power would be P_in = V1 * I1, where V1 is 2300 V and I1 is 4.35 A, so P_in = 2300 * 4.35 ≈ 10,005 W. But that's the input power, which should equal the output plus the losses.

So, P_in = P_out + P_fe + P_cu.

P_out is 10,000 W. P_fe is 69 W. So, P_cu = P_in - P_out - P_fe.

Wait, but P_in is 10,005 W, so P_cu = 10,005 - 10,000 - 69 = -64 W. That can't be. So, clearly, I'm making a mistake somewhere.

Wait, no, the input power is higher than the output because of the losses. So, P_in = P_out + P_fe + P_cu.

So, P_in = 10,000 + 69 + P_cu.

But from the short-circuit test, we know that the copper loss at full load (I1 = 4.35 A) is P_cu = (I1)^2 * R1. We can calculate R1 from the short-circuit test.

From the short-circuit test: V1_sc = 127 V, I1_sc = 4.9 A, P_cu_sc = 263 W.

So, R1 = V1_sc² / I1_sc² = (127)^2 / (4.9)^2 ≈ 16129 / 24.01 ≈ 672 ohms.

But that would make R1 = 672 ohms.

Then, at rated current I1 = 4.35 A, the copper loss is P_cu = I1² * R1 = (4.35)^2 * 672 ≈ 18.92 * 672 ≈ 1269 W. That's way higher than the 263 W from the short-circuit test, which doesn't make sense because the short-circuit test is when the current is higher.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should use the given ohmic resistance test data.

The ohmic resistance test gives:

- Input to low side: 1.89 V DC, 41.0 A DC. So, R2 = V / I = 1.89 / 41.0 ≈ 0.0459 ohms.

- Input to high side: 23.4 V DC, aV2 = 2300 V. So, R1 = 23.4 V / I1. But I'm not sure what the current is here. Wait, the ohmic resistance test is DC, so the current is I1 = 23.4 V / R1. But R1 can be calculated from the low-side test: R1 = a² R2 = (2300/230)^2 * 0.0459 ≈ (10)^2 * 0.0459 ≈ 4.59 ohms.

So, R1 = 4.59 ohms.

But from the short-circuit test, we had R1 = 672 ohms, which contradicts this. So, perhaps the ohmic resistance test is more accurate for finding R1 and R2.

So, using R1 = 4.59 ohms and R2 = 0.0459 ohms.

Then, the copper loss at full load (I1 =4.35 A) is P_cu = I1² R1 = (4.35)^2 * 4.59 ≈ 18.92 * 4.59 ≈ 86.6 W.

At the same time, the copper loss at short-circuit (I1 =4.9 A) would be (4.9)^2 *4.59 ≈24.01 *4.59 ≈110 W. But the short-circuit test gave us 263 W. Hmm, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the ohmic resistance test is in DC, so the resistances are R1 and R2, but the short-circuit test is AC, so it includes reactance as well. So, the ohmic resistance gives us the resistive part, but the short-circuit test includes both resistance and reactance, leading to higher losses. So, perhaps the copper loss at short-circuit is higher than just the resistive loss.

But I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let's try to find the efficiency for part (a) first.

At rated load (10 kVA, pf=1), the input power is P_in = V1 * I1 = 2300 V * 4.35 A ≈10,005 W.

The output power is P_out = 10,000 W (since it's 10 kVA at pf=1).

The losses are P_in - P_out = 10,005 - 10,000 = 5 W. That can't be right because the losses should include both iron and copper.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The losses are P_fe + P_cu, which should be P_in - P_out.

So, P_fe is 69 W, and P_cu at rated load is the copper loss we need to find.

Wait, but earlier when I used R1=4.59 ohms, P_cu at 4.35 A is 86.6 W. Adding P_fe=69 W, total losses are 155.6 W. So, P_in = P_out + 155.6 = 10,000 + 155.6 =10,155.6 W. But the input power is V1 * I1 = 2300 *4.35 ≈10,005 W, which is less than 10,155 W. So, that's a contradiction.

Hmm, perhaps I should use the given data more accurately.

Let me try to summarize the given data:

- Open-circuit test: Input to low side (230 V) gives 69 W. So, P_fe = 69 W.

- Short-circuit test: Input to high side (127 V) gives I=4.9 A, P=263 W. So, copper loss at this current is 263 W.

- Ohmic resistance test: Input to low side (1.89 V) gives I=41 A, so R2 = 1.89 /41 ≈0.0459 ohms. Input to high side (23.4 V) gives I= (23.4)/ R1. But R1 = a² R2 =10² *0.0459=4.59 ohms. So, I_high =23.4 /4.59≈5.09 A.

But in the short-circuit test, the current was 4.9 A. So, perhaps this is close enough, considering some approximation.

Now, to find the copper loss at rated current (I1=4.35 A), we can calculate it as (I1/I_sc)^2 * P_cu_sc.

Where I_sc is the current in the short-circuit test on the high side, which is 4.9 A.

So, (4.35 /4.9)^2 ≈(0.8878)^2≈0.788.

Thus, P_cu_rated = 0.788 *263≈207 W.

So, total losses at rated load are P_fe + P_cu_rated =69 +207≈276 W.

Input power P_in = V1 * I1 =2300 *4.35≈10,005 W.

Output power P_out = P_in - losses =10,005 -276≈9,729 W.

But the transformer is rated at 10 kVA, so P_out should be 10,000 W. So, perhaps the calculation is approximate.

Efficiency η = (P_out / P_in) *100 = (9,729 /10,005)*100≈97.23%.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options exactly. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: 90.5%, 98.3%
B:93.8%,92.4%
C:92.5%,95.3%
D:97.3%,96.1%
E:95.6%,93.7%
F:99.2%,97.5%
G:98.1%,94.6%
H:96.7%,97.8%
I:91.3%,90.7%
J:94.1%,95.9%

Hmm, 97.23% is close to option D's 97.3%, but let's proceed to part (b) to see if that aligns.

For part (b), we're operating at half the rated kVA (5 kVA) at pf=0.6 lead.

First, the load is 5 kVA at pf=0.6. So, the output power is P_out =5,000 *0.6 =3,000 W.

The current on the low side is I2 = (5,000) / (230) ≈21.74 A.

The current on the high side is I1 =21.74 /10≈2.174 A.

Now, we need to find the copper loss at I1=2.174 A.

Using the same approach, P_cu = (I1 / I_sc)^2 * P_cu_sc.

I_sc is 4.9 A, so (2.174 /4.9)^2≈(0.4437)^2≈0.1968.

Thus, P_cu =0.1968 *263≈51.6 W.

The iron loss (P_fe) remains the same at 69 W.

Total losses =69 +51.6≈120.6 W.

Input power P_in =V1 * I1 =2300 *2.174≈4,999.8≈5,000 W.

Output power P_out=3,000 W.

Efficiency η = (3,000 /5,000)*100=60%? No, wait, that can't be right because we're not considering the losses correctly.

Wait, no, the input power is P_in = P_out + losses.

So, P_in =3,000 +120.6≈3,120.6 W.

Efficiency η = (3,000 /3,120.6)*100≈96.13%.

Looking at the options, option D has 97.3% for part (a) and 96.1% for part (b), which matches our calculations.

Wait, but earlier for part (a), I got approximately 97.2%, which aligns with D's 97.3%. And part (b) is about 96.1%, which matches D's second value.

So, the answer should be D:97.3%,96.1%.
</think>

To determine the efficiency of the transformer under the given conditions, we analyze the losses and calculate the efficiency for both scenarios.

  \]

#### (b) Half-Rated Load (5 kVA, \(pf = 0.6\)):
- **Output Power**:
  \[
  P_{out} = 5,000 \, \text{kVA} \times 0.6 \, pf = 3,000 \, W
  \]
- **Current on High Side**:
  \[
  I_1 = \frac{P_{out}}{V_1 \times pf} = \frac{3,000}{2300 \times 0.6} \approx 2.174 \, A
  \]
- **Copper Loss at Half-Rated Load**:
  \[
  P_{Cu} = \left(\frac{2.174}{4.9}\right)^2 \times 263 \approx 51.6 \, W
  \]
- **Total Losses**:
  \[
  P_{Fe} + P_{Cu} = 69 + 51.6 = 120.6 \, W
  \]
- **Input Power**:
  \[
  P_{in} = P_{out} + P_{Fe} + P_{Cu} = 3,000 + 120.6 = 3,120.6 \, W
  \]
- **Efficiency**:
  \[
  \eta = \frac{3,000}{3,120.6} \times 100 \approx 96.13\%
  \]

### Conclusion:
The efficiencies for the two cases are approximately **97.3%** and **96.1%**, which match **Option D**.
