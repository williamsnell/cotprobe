Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says: You throw a ball from a window that's 8.0 meters above the ground. When you throw it, the ball leaves your hand at 10.0 m/s at an angle of 20 degrees below the horizontal. I need to find out how far horizontally from the window the ball will hit the ground. Air resistance is ignored, so that simplifies things a bit.

Hmm, right, projectile motion. The key here is to break the problem into horizontal and vertical components. Since the ball is thrown below the horizontal, the initial velocity will have both horizontal (x) and vertical (y) components. But wait, since it's thrown below the horizontal, the vertical component will be downward, which means the initial vertical velocity is negative if I take upward as positive.

Let me jot down the given values:

- Initial height (y0) = 8.0 m
- Initial speed (v0) = 10.0 m/s
- Launch angle (θ) = 20 degrees below horizontal
- Horizontal distance from window (x) = ?
- Acceleration in y-direction (a_y) = g = 9.8 m/s² downward, so a_y = -9.8 m/s²? Wait, no, wait. If I take upward as positive, then the acceleration due to gravity is negative, a_y = -9.8 m/s². But wait, in projectile motion, when you throw something downward, the initial vertical velocity is negative. So initial vertical velocity (v0y) is negative. Let me confirm: yes, because downward is the negative direction in standard coordinate systems.

First, I'll find the initial horizontal and vertical velocities.

The horizontal component (v0x) is v0 * cos(θ). The vertical component (v0y) is v0 * sin(θ), but since it's directed downward, it'll be negative. So:

v0x = 10.0 * cos(20°)
v0y = -10.0 * sin(20°)

Let me calculate those. I'll need a calculator for the trigonometric functions.

Calculating cos(20°): cos(20) ≈ 0.9397
So v0x ≈ 10.0 * 0.9397 ≈ 9.397 m/s

Calculating sin(20°): sin(20) ≈ 0.3420
So v0y ≈ -10.0 * 0.3420 ≈ -3.420 m/s

Alright, so the initial vertical velocity is downward at about -3.42 m/s.

Now, I need to find the time (t) it takes for the ball to hit the ground. The vertical motion is governed by the equation:

y(t) = y0 + v0y * t + 0.5 * a_y * t²

Here, y(t) is the final vertical position, which is 0 m (since the ground is at height 0). So substituting:

0 = 8.0 + (-3.420) * t + 0.5 * (-9.8) * t²

Wait, because a_y is the acceleration. Since the acceleration is downward, and I've taken upward as positive, a_y is -9.8 m/s². Wait no, wait: in the equation, the acceleration term is 0.5 * a * t². So I have to plug in a_y as -9.8 m/s².

So the equation becomes:

0 = 8.0 - 3.420 t - 4.9 t²

Rearranging terms:

4.9 t² + 3.420 t - 8.0 = 0

This is a quadratic equation in the form a t² + b t + c = 0, where:
a = 4.9
b = 3.420
c = -8.0

I can solve this using the quadratic formula: t = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)

Calculating the discriminant first:

D = b² - 4ac = (3.420)^2 - 4 * 4.9 * (-8.0)

Compute each part:

(3.420)^2 ≈ 11.6964

4 * 4.9 = 19.6; 19.6 * (-8.0) = -156.8, so -4ac is -4*4.9*(-8.0) = +156.8.

So D ≈ 11.6964 + 156.8 = 168.4964

Now, sqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(168.4964) ≈ 12.988

So t = [ -3.420 ± 12.988 ] / (2 * 4.9) → denominator is 9.8

We have two solutions:

t1 = (-3.420 + 12.988) / 9.8 ≈ (9.568) / 9.8 ≈ 0.976 seconds

t2 = (-3.420 -12.988) / 9.8 ≈ (-16.408)/9.8 ≈ -1.674 seconds

Since time can't be negative, we take t ≈ 0.976 seconds.

Now, with the time known, I can find the horizontal distance. The horizontal motion is at constant velocity because there's no air resistance, so acceleration is zero. Thus, horizontal distance x = v0x * t.

We have v0x ≈ 9.397 m/s and t ≈ 0.976 s.

x ≈ 9.397 * 0.976 ≈ Let me compute that.

9.397 * 0.976 ≈ 9.397 * (1 - 0.024) = 9.397 - (9.397 * 0.024)

9.397 * 0.024 ≈ 0.2255

So 9.397 - 0.2255 ≈ 9.1715 m

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is option B:9.2, but wait, let me check my calculations again because 9.1715 is approximately 9.17, which would round to 9.2. But wait, let me recalculate the multiplication more accurately.

Alternatively, 9.397 * 0.976:

Compute 9.397 * 0.976:

First, 9 * 0.976 = 8.784

0.397 * 0.976 ≈ let's compute 0.4 * 0.976 = 0.3904, then subtract 0.003 * 0.976 ≈ 0.002928, so 0.3904 - 0.002928 ≈ 0.3875

So total is 8.784 + 0.3875 ≈ 9.1715 m. So about 9.17 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 9.2 m. But wait, another option is H:12.4, which is higher. Did I make a mistake in the time calculation?

Wait, let me double-check the quadratic equation solution.

The equation was 4.9 t² + 3.42 t -8.0 =0.

Using the quadratic formula:

t = [ -3.42 ± sqrt(3.42^2 -4*4.9*(-8)) ]/(2*4.9)

Compute discriminant again:

3.42^2 = 11.6964

4*4.9=19.6; 19.6 * (-8) = -156.8 → so 4ac = 4*4.9*(-8) = -156.8 → so -4ac is +156.8.

So D = 11.6964 + 156.8 = 168.4964 → sqrt ≈12.988.

So t = [ -3.42 +12.988 ] / 9.8 → 9.568/9.8 ≈ 0.976 s.

That seems correct. So time is correct.

Wait, but the horizontal distance I calculated is about 9.17 m, which rounds to 9.2 m, so option B.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 12.4, which is higher. Did I miss something?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign of the vertical acceleration. Let me re-examine that.

In the vertical motion equation, I set upward as positive. So the acceleration due to gravity is downward, which is negative. So a_y = -9.8 m/s².

Wait, so the equation is:

y(t) = y0 + v0y * t + 0.5 * a_y * t²

Which becomes:

0 = 8.0 + (-3.420)t + 0.5*(-9.8)t²

So 0 = 8.0 -3.420 t -4.9 t² → which rearranged is 4.9 t² +3.420 t -8.0 =0.

Wait, that's correct. So the quadratic equation is correct.

But when I compute t, I get about 0.976 s. So then x = 9.397 *0.976 ≈9.17 m, which is 9.2 m, option B.

Wait, but let me check if I messed up the angle. The angle is 20 degrees below the horizontal, so the vertical component is negative, which I accounted for.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have taken downward as positive. Let me try that approach, just to see.

If I take downward as positive, then the initial vertical velocity v0y would be positive 3.420 m/s, and acceleration a_y would be +9.8 m/s².

In that case, the equation becomes:

y(t) = y0 + v0y * t + 0.5 * a_y * t²

But since the window is at 8 m above ground, the displacement y is -8 m (because it's downward from the initial point). So:

-8.0 = 3.420 t + 0.5 *9.8 t²

Which rearranges to:

4.9 t² +3.420 t +8.0 =0

Wait, no, because y(t) would be -8.0 m relative to the starting point, so:

-8.0 = 3.420 t +4.9 t²

Which becomes 4.9 t² +3.420 t +8.0 =0

Wait, that can't be right because discriminant would be (3.420)^2 -4*4.9*8.0 → 11.6964 - 156.8 → negative, which implies no real solution, which can't be right.

So that approach must be wrong. Therefore, my initial approach with upward positive is correct.

So back to t ≈0.976 seconds.

Hmm, but looking at the options, 9.2 is an option, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes these problems can have a bigger time of flight, but maybe not.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of x. Let me recompute x.

v0x is 9.397 m/s, t=0.976 s. So 9.397 *0.976:

Compute 9 *0.976 =8.784

0.397 *0.976: Let's compute 0.3 *0.976 =0.2928, 0.097 *0.976≈0.0946.

Adding them: 0.2928 +0.0946=0.3874.

So total x=8.784 +0.3874=9.1714 m.

Which is approximately 9.17 m, so 9.2 m.

Looking back at the options, option B is 9.2, which seems correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit surprised because the initial vertical velocity is downward, so the time of flight is actually shorter than if it were thrown upward. So the distance being around 9 meters makes sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if I used the correct angle. The problem says 20 degrees below the horizontal, so the angle is measured from the horizontal downward, which I correctly took as negative for the vertical component.

So I think my approach is correct, and the answer should be approximately 9.2 meters, which is option B.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the projectile motion by breaking it into horizontal and vertical components. The ball is thrown downward at an angle of 20° below the horizontal with an initial speed of 10.0 m/s from a height of 8.0 m. 

### Step 1: Initial Velocity Components
- **Horizontal velocity**: \( v_{0x} = v_0 \cos(20^\circ) \approx 10.0 \times 0.9397 \approx 9.397 \, \text{m/s} \)
- **Vertical velocity**: \( v_{0y} = -v_0 \sin(20^\circ) \approx -10.0 \times 0.3420 \approx -3.420 \, \text{m/s} \) (negative because it's downward)

### Step 2: Time of Flight
The vertical motion is governed by:
\[
y(t) = y_0 + v_{0y} t + \frac{1}{2} a_y t^2
\]
where \( y_0 = 8.0 \, \text{m} \), \( a_y = -9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), and \( y(t) = 0 \) (ground level). Substituting:
\[
0 = 8.0 - 3.420 t - 4.9 t^2
\]
Rearranging:
\[
4.9 t^2 + 3.420 t - 8.0 = 0
\]
Using the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \) with \( a = 4.9 \), \( b = 3.420 \), and \( c = -8.0 \):
\[
t = \frac{-3.420 \pm \sqrt{3.420^2 - 4(4.9)(-8.0)}}{2(4.9)}
\]
\[
t = \frac{-3.420 \pm \sqrt{11.6964 + 156.8}}{9.8}
\]
\[
t = \frac{-3.420 \pm 12.988}{9.8}
\]
Taking the positive root:
\[
t \approx \frac{9.568}{9.8} \approx 0.976 \, \text{seconds}
\]

### Step 3: Horizontal Distance
The horizontal distance is given by:
\[
x = v_{0x} t
\]
\[
x \approx 9.397 \times 0.976 \approx 9.171 \, \text{m}
\]
Rounding to two decimal places, \( x \approx 9.2 \, \text{m} \).

### Final Answer
The ball will hit the ground approximately **9.2 meters** horizontally from the window.

**Answer: B**
