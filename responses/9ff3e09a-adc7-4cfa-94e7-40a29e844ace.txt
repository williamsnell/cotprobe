<think>
Okay, so I've got this problem about a one plate clutch, and I need to find the frictional torque and the axial force. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on clutches, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let's see what the question says. It's a one plate clutch, and both sides of the plate deliver torque. The coefficient of friction is 0.35, and the maximum permissible pressure is 20 psi. The clutch has an inside diameter of 20 inches and an outside diameter of 24 inches. I need to find the frictional torque and the axial force between the discs.

Wait, wait, a one plate clutch usually means there's a single driven plate, right? So the pressure plate is on one side, and the driven plate is on the other. But the question says both sides deliver torque, which is a bit confusing. Maybe it means that the torque is transmitted from both sides of the plate? Or perhaps it's a dual clutch setup? No, probably not. Maybe it's a single plate but both sides are in contact, like maybe the plate is between two flywheels? Or perhaps it's a clutch where both sides of the plate are used for friction. Hmm, I'll proceed with the assumption that it's a single plate with both sides contributing to the torque.

So, the formula for frictional torque in a clutch is T = 0.5 * μ * P * (D_out + D_in)/2 * π? Wait, no, I think the formula involves the average diameter and the circumference. Let me think again.

The frictional torque (T) is given by T = μ * P * A, where A is the area of contact. But wait, P is the pressure, μ is the coefficient of friction. Oh, but in this case, since both sides deliver torque, I think that the total area would be double what it would be for a single side. Or maybe it's just the same as a single side because the area is the same on both sides. Wait, no, each side has the same area, so together, the total area would be twice that of one side. Or wait, maybe not. Because for a single plate clutch, the area is the same on both sides, so maybe the torque is calculated as the sum of both sides.

Wait, no, the area for each side is the same, so if both sides are in contact, the total frictional force would be double that of a single side. Let me get this straight. The area of contact for one side is π*(D_out^2 - D_in^2)/4, right? Because it's an annulus. So for both sides, it would be double that.

Wait, but in a single plate clutch, each side is an annulus, but in a one plate clutch, maybe the plate is only in contact on one side. Wait, no, no, the plate is between two flywheels, for example. So the plate has two friction surfaces, one on each side. So when the clutch is engaged, the pressure is applied axially, and both sides of the plate contact the flywheels. So the total area would be two times the area of one side.

So the area A = π*(D_out^2 - D_in^2)/4. But since both sides are in contact, the total contact area would be 2*A, so 2*(π*(D_out^2 - D_in^2)/4) = π*(D_out^2 - D_in^2)/2.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Each side has an area of π*(D_out^2 - D_in^2)/4. So two sides would be π*(D_out^2 - D_in^2)/2. Yes, that makes sense.

So the formula for torque is T = μ * P * A_total, where A_total is the combined area of both sides.

Wait, but I've also heard that the torque is calculated as T = μ * P * (π*(D_out + D_in)/2) * (D_out - D_in)/2. Let me check that. The annular area is π*(D_out^2 - D_in^2)/4, which can be written as π*(D_out + D_in)/2 * (D_out - D_in)/2. So A = π*(D_out + D_in)/2 * (D_out - D_in)/2.

So if both sides are in contact, then A_total = 2*A = 2*(π*(D_out + D_in)/2 * (D_out - D_in)/2) ) = π*(D_out + D_in)/2 * (D_out - D_in)/1.

Wait, no, let me compute it step by step.

A for one side is π*(D_out² - D_in²)/4. So two sides would be 2*(π*(D_out² - D_in²)/4) = π*(D_out² - D_in²)/2.

Alternatively, A_total = π*(D_out² - D_in²)/2.

But let's compute D_out and D_in. D_out = 24 in, D_in = 20 in.

So D_out² = 24^2 = 576, D_in² = 20^2 = 400. So D_out² - D_in² = 176.

So A_total = π * 176 / 2 = π * 88.

Wait, π * 88 is approximately 276.46 square inches.

Now, torque T is μ * P * A_total.

μ is 0.35, P is 20 psi.

So T = 0.35 * 20 * 276.46.

Wait, 0.35 * 20 = 7, then 7 * 276.46 = 1935.22 lbs-in.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 19,352 lbs-in. Hmm, that's ten times higher than my calculation. Did I miss a factor somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, the area of one side is π*(D_out² - D_in²)/4. So for both sides, it's 2*(π*(D_out² - D_in²)/4) = π*(D_out² - D_in²)/2.

So D_out² - D_in² = 576 - 400 = 176.

So A_total = π * 176 / 2 = π * 88 ≈ 276.46 in².

Then T = μ * P * A_total.

μ = 0.35, P = 20 psi.

So 0.35 * 20 = 7, then 7 * 276.46 ≈ 1935.22 lbs-in.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option F, which is 9676 lbs-in, and option A is 19,352.

Wait, did I forget to account for something? Oh wait, perhaps I miscalculated the area. Let me double-check the area.

Wait, wait, the area of the annulus is π*(D_out² - D_in²)/4. So for both sides, it's 2*(π*(D_out² - D_in²)/4) = π*(D_out² - D_in²)/2.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but maybe the pressure P is applied per side, so the total pressure is 20 psi on each side. Wait, no, the maximum permissible pressure is 20 psi, so that's the pressure per side. So when both sides are considered, the total force would be P * area per side * 2.

Wait, but in torque calculation, the formula is T = μ * P * A_total.

Wait, but in some sources, the formula for torque is T = μ * P * (π*(D_out + D_in)/2) * (D_out - D_in)/2.

Wait, let's try that approach. So the mean diameter is (D_out + D_in)/2. The effective radius is (D_out - D_in)/2. Then the torque is μ * P * π * r_mean * circumference?

Wait, maybe the correct formula is T = μ * P * (π * (D_out + D_in)/2) * (D_out - D_in)/2.

Wait, D_out = 24 in, D_in = 20 in. So D_out + D_in = 44, D_out - D_in =4.

Mean diameter is 44/2 = 22 in. The radius is 22/2 = 11 in.

Wait, perhaps the formula is T = μ * P * π * r_mean * (D_out - D_in)/2.

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, the torque can be calculated as T = μ * P * (π*(D_out² - D_in²)/4) * 2, because both sides are in contact.

Wait, so T = μ * P * (π*(D_out² - D_in²)/4) * 2.

Which simplifies to T = μ * P * π*(D_out² - D_in²)/2.

Which is the same as before. So 0.35 * 20 * π*(176)/2.

Wait, that's 0.35 * 20 =7. 7 * π * 88 ≈ 7 * 276.46 ≈ 1935.22 lbs-in.

But the options don't have that. Wait, looking at the options, option F is 9676 lbs-in, which is about half of 19352. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the area.

Wait, perhaps the area is only one side, and the torque is calculated for one side, but the question says both sides deliver torque, so I need to double the torque.

Wait, no, because when both sides are in contact, the total frictional force is double that of one side. So the torque would be double what it would be for one side.

Wait, let me recast the problem. For a single side, the area is π*(24² - 20²)/4 = π*(576-400)/4 = π*(176)/4 = 44π ≈ 138.23 in².

So torque for one side is μ * P * area = 0.35 * 20 * 138.23 ≈ 0.35 * 20 =7, 7 * 138.23 ≈ 967.61 lbs-in.

But since both sides are in contact, the total torque is 2 * 967.61 ≈ 1935.22 lbs-in. Which brings me back to the same number as before, about 1935 lbs-in. But none of the options match this, except option F is 9676, which is roughly 10 times higher, and option A is 19,352, which is about 10 times higher than my result.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 10 because the diameters are in inches, but the pressure is in psi, which is per square inch. Let me check the units again.

Pressure P is in psi, which is pounds per square inch. Area is in square inches, so when I multiply P (psi) by area (in²), I get pounds.

So T = μ * P * A, which gives torque in lb-in.

Wait, so my calculation gives 1935.22 lb-in, but option F is 9676, which is about 5 times that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation. Let me compute D_out squared minus D_in squared again.

D_out =24, so 24²=576.

D_in=20, so 20²=400.

576-400=176.

So area per side is π*(176)/4 = 44π ≈ 138.23 in².

Two sides: 2*138.23≈276.46 in².

T=0.35 *20 *276.46=7 *276.46≈1935.22 lb-in.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, maybe the clutch is a single plate but only one side is in contact. Then the area is 138.23 in², and torque would be 7 * 138.23 ≈967.61 lb-in. But that's about 9676 when multiplied by 10, which is option F. Hmm, could I have missed a factor of 10 because the diameters were given in inches and perhaps I should have converted to feet? No, because torque would be in lb-in, not needing conversion.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers that the average diameter is (24+20)/2=22 inches, so radius is 11 inches. Then the circumference is π*22 inches. The average radius is 11 inches. So torque would be μ * P * (circumference) * axial force.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is T = μ * P * (π*(D_out + D_in)/2) * (D_out - D_in)/2.

So let's compute that.

(D_out + D_in) = 24 +20=44, divided by 2 is 22 inches.

(D_out - D_in)=4 inches.

So (22 * 4) = 88. Multiply by π gives 88π ≈276.46.

Then T =0.35 *20 *276.46 ≈1935.22 lb-in.

Same as before.

Wait, but the options don't have that. So maybe I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, the question says "one plate clutch assuming that both sides of the plate deliver torque." So maybe the plate is between two pressure plates, so both sides are in contact, but the area is the same as a single side. No, that can't be, because then the area would be the same as one side, but the torque would be the same as one side.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option F is 9676 lb-in, which is about 5 times my 1935 lb-in. Hmm.

Wait, wait, perhaps the formula uses the average diameter as the effective diameter. So the effective diameter is (24 +20)/2=22 inches. So the radius is 11 inches.

Then, the area is π*(22)^2 * n, but wait, no, that's the area of a circle, but we have an annulus.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should compute the area again.

Area of annulus per side: π*(D_out² - D_in²)/4 = π*(576 -400)/4 = π*176/4 = 44π ≈138.23 in².

Two sides: 276.46 in².

Torque T = μ * P * area =0.35 *20 *276.46= 7 *276.46≈1935.22 lb-in.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem is using a different approach, like considering the mean radius as (D_out + D_in)/2, and then the torque is μ * P * π * mean radius * (D_out - D_in)/2.

Mean radius R = (24 +20)/2 /2 = (44/2)/2=22/2=11 inches.

The width of the clutch is (D_out - D_in)/2 =4/2=2 inches.

So torque T= μ * P * π * R * width.

So T=0.35 *20 * π *11 *2.

Let me compute that.

0.35 *20=7.

π*11*2=69.115.

7 *69.115≈483.81 lb-in.

But that's way lower than any of the options. So maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula is T = μ * P * π * (D_out + D_in)/2 * (D_out - D_in)/2.

So T=0.35 *20 * π * (24+20)/2 * (24-20)/2.

Compute each part:

(24+20)/2=44/2=22.

(24-20)/2=4/2=2.

So T=0.35 *20 * π *22 *2.

0.35 *20=7.

22*2=44.

7 *44=308.

308 * π ≈967.61 lb-in.

Hmm, that's about 967 lb-in, which is option F's first part (9676), but it's ten times higher. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, no, all units are in inches, so that shouldn't be an issue. Wait, perhaps the formula is T= μ * P * π * (D_out² - D_in²)/4 * 2, which would be μ * P * π*(D_out² - D_in²)/2.

Which brings us back to 1935 lb-in.

But the options don't have that. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A: 19,352 lbs.-in., 2513.27 lbs.

F:9676 lbs.-in., 2513.27 lbs.

Hmm, option A is 10 times 1935.22, which is 19352.2. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, maybe the diameters were in inches, but the calculation requires them in some other unit. No, the area is in square inches, so it's correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula for torque is T= μ * P * (π*(D_out² - D_in²)/4) * 2, which is μ * P * π*(D_out² - D_in²)/2.

So D_out=24, D_in=20.

D_out² - D_in²=576-400=176.

So T=0.35 *20 * π *176/2.

0.35 *20=7.

176/2=88.

So T=7 * π *88 ≈7 *276.46≈1935.22 lb-in.

Again, same result.

Wait, but option A is 19,352, which is exactly 10 times that. Did I perhaps forget that the area is for both sides, but the pressure is per side? Or maybe the pressure is applied on both sides, so the total pressure is 40 psi? No, the problem states maximum permissible pressure is 20 psi, so that's per side.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation. Let me compute the area again.

Area per side: π*(24² -20²)/4.

24²=576, 20²=400.

576-400=176.

So area per side: π*176/4=44π≈138.23 in².

Two sides: 276.46 in².

So torque T=0.35 *20 *276.46=7*276.46≈1935.22 lb-in.

So the frictional torque is approximately 1935 lb-in. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but looking at the options, option A is 19,352, which is 10 times higher. Maybe I missed a factor of 10 because the diameters were in inches and I should have converted to feet? Let me try that.

Wait, no, because torque would be in lb-ft, but the options are in lb-in. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the average diameter as (24+20)/2=22 inches, and the radius is 11 inches.

Then, the area per side is π*(22)^2 - π*(20)^2 = π*(484-400)=84π ≈264 in².

Wait, no, that's not correct because the inner diameter is 20 inches, so the area would be π*(24²-20²)/4= π*176/4=44π≈138.23 in² per side.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of mean radius. The mean radius is (24+20)/2=22 inches, so radius is 11 inches.

Then, the area per side is π*(24² -20²)/4= π*(576-400)/4= π*176/4=44π≈138.23 in².

So torque is μ * P * area =0.35 *20 *138.23≈967.61 lb-in per side, so two sides would be 1935.22 lb-in.

But again, the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but looking at the options, option F is 9676 lb-in, which is about 5 times my result. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the plate is a single side, so the torque is 967.61 lb-in, but that's not an option either.

Wait, maybe I should look at the axial force. The axial force is the total force applied to create the necessary pressure. The pressure P is given as 20 psi, which is force per unit area. So the axial force F is P multiplied by the area where the force is applied. But wait, in a clutch, the axial force is applied to push the plate against the flywheel, so the area would be the area of the plate that is in contact.

Wait, but in this case, the pressure is 20 psi on both sides. So the total axial force would be P multiplied by the total area of contact. Wait, but wait, pressure is force per area, so F = P * A.

But wait, in a clutch, the axial force F is the force that presses the plates together. So for each side, the force is F = P * area per side.

But since both sides are in contact, the total axial force would be F_total = F_side1 + F_side2 = 2*(P * area_per_side).

Wait, but no, because the same axial force is applied to both sides. Wait, no, the axial force is the same on both sides because it's the clamping force.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The axial force F is the force that causes the pressure P between the plates. So F = P * A, where A is the area where the force is applied.

But in a clutch, the axial force is applied to both sides, so the total force would be F = P * A_total, where A_total is the contact area.

Wait, but no, because each side's contact area is A, so the total force would be F = P * A + P * A = 2 * P * A.

But wait, that would be if each side's force is P*A. But in reality, the same axial force F is applied on both sides, so F = P * A per side. So the total F is the same as the force on one side.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try with numbers.

Area per side: 138.23 in².

Pressure per side: 20 psi.

So the force per side is F = P * A =20 psi *138.23 in² = 2764.6 lbs.

Since there are two sides, the total axial force would be 2 *2764.6 ≈5529.2 lbs.

But looking at the options, none have that. The options have axial forces around 2500 to 2765 lbs.

Wait, but maybe the axial force is the same for both sides, so the total force is F = P * A_total.

A_total=276.46 in².

So F=20 psi *276.46 in²=5529.2 lbs.

But again, none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the axial force is just the force on one side, which would be 2764.6 lbs, which is approximately 2765 lbs. Looking at the options, option G has 2765 lbs, but its torque is 10,673, which is less than my calculated torque. Option H has torque 21,346 and axial force 2765.

But earlier, my torque calculation for both sides was 1935 lb-in, but option H has torque 21,346, which is about 10 times higher.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-express the torque in terms of the mean radius and the width.

Mean radius R = (24+20)/2 /2 =11 inches.

Width w = (24-20)/2=2 inches.

Then, torque T= μ * P * π * R * w.

So T=0.35 *20 * π *11 *2.

Let's compute that:

0.35 *20=7.

π *11 *2≈69.115.

7 *69.115≈483.805 lb-in.

But that's way lower than any option. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is T= μ * P * (π*(D_out + D_in)/2) * (D_out - D_in)/2.

Which would be T=0.35 *20 * π*(24+20)/2*(24-20)/2.

Compute each part:

24+20=44, divided by 2=22.

24-20=4, divided by 2=2.

So T=0.35 *20 * π *22 *2.

0.35*20=7.

22*2=44.

7*44=308.

308 * π≈967.61 lb-in.

Again, same as before.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the clutch has an inner and outer diameter, but the plate is a single plate, so the area is only one side. So the torque would be 967.61 lb-in, and the axial force would be 2764.6 lbs. But none of the options match.

Wait, looking back at the options, option F is 9676 lb-in and 2513.27 lbs. Hmm, 9676 is about 10 times 967.61, and 2513.27 is about 2764.6/3. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the formula for torque is T= μ * P * (π*(D_out² - D_in²)/4) * 2, which is μ * P * π*(D_out² - D_in²)/2.

So D_out=24, D_in=20.

D_out² - D_in²=576-400=176.

So T=0.35 *20 * π *176/2.

0.35 *20=7.

176/2=88.

So T=7 * π *88≈7 *276.46≈1935.22 lb-in.

But again, no option matches this.

Wait, perhaps the axial force is F = P * (π*(D_out² - D_in²)/4).

So F=20 psi * (π*(576-400)/4).

Which is 20 * (π*176/4)=20 *44π≈20 *138.23≈2764.6 lbs.

Looking at the options, option G has 2765 lbs, but its torque is 10,673, which is much lower than my calculated torque.

Wait, but option F has axial force 2513.27 lbs, which is close to 2764.6, but not exact.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation. Let me try to compute π*(24² -20²)/4 again.

24²=576, 20²=400.

576-400=176.

176/4=44.

44 * π≈138.23 in² per side.

So two sides: 276.46 in².

So torque T=0.35 *20 *276.46≈1935.22 lb-in.

Axial force F=20 psi *276.46 in²≈5529.2 lbs.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, looking at the options, option F has torque 9676 lb-in and axial force 2513.27 lbs. So perhaps the axial force is being calculated as F=P * (π*(D_out² - D_in²)/4).

So F=20 * (π*(576-400)/4)=20 *44π≈20 *138.23≈2764.6 lbs, which is about 2765 lbs.

So in the options, option G is 10,673 lb-in and 2765 lbs. Hmm, but my torque is 1935 lb-in, not 10,673.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the area. Maybe the area is only one side, so the torque is 967.61 lb-in, and the axial force is 2764.6 lbs. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the axial force is just P multiplied by the area of one side.

F=20 psi *138.23 in²≈2764.6 lbs.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the formula for torque is T= μ * P * π * (D_out + D_in)/2 * (D_out - D_in)/2.

Which gives T=0.35 *20 * π *22 *2≈967.61 lb-in.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the average radius and the average width, but I'm not sure.

At this point, I think I've made a mistake somewhere, but I can't figure out where. Looking at the options, the closest match to my torque calculation is option F (9676 lb-in) and option A (19,352 lb-in). Since my calculation for two sides gives 1935 lb-in, which is not listed, perhaps the correct answer is option F, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the plate is a single side, so the torque is 967.61 lb-in, which is approximately 968 lb-in. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the torque as T= μ * P * π * R^2 * n, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the mean diameter is (24+20)/2=22 inches, and the radius is 11 inches. Then, the area is π*(22)^2 - π*(20)^2= π*(484-400)=84π≈264 in².

So torque T=0.35 *20 *264≈0.35*20=7, 7*264=1848 lb-in.

Still not matching any option.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is T= μ * P * π * (D_out - D_in)/2 * (D_out + D_in)/2.

Wait, that's the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is T= μ * P * (π*(D_out + D_in)/2)^2.

Which would be T=0.35 *20 * (π*22)^2.

But that would be a much larger number, which doesn't match the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is T= μ * P * (average diameter) * circumference.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the clutch is a single plate, but the axial force is the same on both sides, so the total torque is μ * P * area per side *2.

Which brings us back to 1935 lb-in.

But since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option F, which has 9676 lb-in and 2513.27 lbs.

Wait, let me compute the axial force for option F: F=2513.27 lbs.

If F= P * area, then area= F/P=2513.27/20≈125.66 in².

Which is approximately π*40 in² (since π*40≈125.66). So that would mean the area is 40 in².

But the area per side is 138.23 in², so this doesn't add up.

Alternatively, perhaps the axial force is calculated as F= P * (π*(D_out^2 - D_in^2)/4).

Which would be F=20 * (π*176/4)=20 *44π≈2764.6 lbs.

So the only option close to that is option G, which has 2765 lbs, but its torque is 10,673 lb-in, which is higher than my calculation.

Wait, perhaps the torque is calculated as T= μ * P * (π*(D_out + D_in)/2) * (D_out - D_in)/2.

Which gives T=0.35 *20 * π*22*2≈967.61 lb-in.

But again, not matching any option.

At this point, I think I might have to choose the closest option. Since my calculation for two sides gives 1935 lb-in, which is not an option, but option A is 19,352, which is exactly 10 times higher. Maybe I missed a factor of 10 somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the diameters were in inches but should have been converted to feet, but that would make the torque in lb-ft, which doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is T= μ * P * π*(D_out^2 - D_in^2)/4 * 10, which would give 1935 *10=19,350 lb-in, which matches option A.

But I don't know why that factor of 10 would be there. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Given the options, I think the correct answer is option F:9676 lb-in and 2513.27 lbs. Because 9676 is approximately 10 times 967.61, which is the torque for one side. But I'm not entirely sure.

To evaluate the frictional torque and axial force for the given one plate clutch, the following steps were considered:

1. **Frictional Torque Calculation**:  
   The formula for frictional torque is:  
   \[
   T = \mu \cdot P \cdot A
   \]  
   where \( \mu = 0.35 \), \( P = 20 \, \text{psi} \), and \( A \) is the total contact area.  

   The contact area for one side of the clutch is:  
   \[
   A_{\text{side}} = \frac{\pi (D_{\text{out}}^2 - D_{\text{in}}^2)}{4}
   \]  
   Substituting \( D_{\text{out}} = 24 \, \text{in} \) and \( D_{\text{in}} = 20 \, \text{in} \):  
   \[
   A_{\text{side}} = \frac{\pi (24^2 - 20^2)}{4} = \frac{\pi (576 - 400)}{4} = \frac{\pi \cdot 176}{4} = 44\pi \approx 138.23 \, \text{in}^2
   \]  
   Since both sides of the plate deliver torque, the total contact area is:  
   \[
   A_{\text{total}} = 2 \cdot A_{\text{side}} = 2 \cdot 138.23 \approx 276.46 \, \text{in}^2
   \]  
   Substituting into the torque formula:  
   \[
   T = 0.35 \cdot 20 \cdot 276.46 \approx 1935.22 \, \text{lb-in}
   \]  

2. **Axial Force Calculation**:  
   The axial force is given by:  
   \[
   F = P \cdot A_{\text{total}}
   \]  
   Substituting \( P = 20 \, \text{psi} \) and \( A_{\text{total}} = 276.46 \, \text{in}^2 \):  
   \[
   F = 20 \cdot 276.46 \approx 5529.2 \, \text{lbs}
   \]  

3. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated torque (\( \approx 1935 \, \text{lb-in} \)) and axial force (\( \approx 5529.2 \, \text{lbs} \)) do not match any of the provided options. However, option \( \text{F} \) (\( 9676 \, \text{lb-in}, 2513.27 \, \text{lbs} \)) is considered the closest match, possibly due to a discrepancy in the problem setup or assumptions.

**Answer**:  
F
