Question:

A student was a practical joker who liked to perform zany antics. Late at night after studying, he would often walk around the campus dressed only in a raincoat and boxers. As he approached young women, he would flash them by opening his raincoat and exposing himself in his shorts. The student believed that he was committing a crime by flashing himself in front of the co-eds. In this jurisdiction, it is a felony to flash or expose oneself in the nude, so, unknown to the student, what he was doing was not a crime. One night, the student broke into a sorority house intending to flash the sorority sisters. Clad only in his raincoat and shorts, he entered the bedroom of one of the sisters who was lying in her bed studying for an exam. The sister, who knew the student, said, "What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be studying for finals?" The student then took off his raincoat and responded, "Study this, baby!" He then began to run through the sorority house in his shorts. Shortly thereafter, the police arrived and placed the student under arrest. If the student is prosecuted, he should be found guilty of which, if any, of the following crimes?

Options:

A: Neither burglary nor attempted violation of the statute.
B: Attempted violation of the statute.
C: Both indecent exposure and attempted violation of the statute.
D: Both trespassing and attempted violation of the statute.
E: Both burglary and indecent exposure.
F: Trespassing only.
G: Both burglary and attempted violation of the statute.
H: Indecent exposure only.
I: Both burglary and trespassing.

Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So the question is about criminal law, specifically regarding the crimes of burglary, indecent exposure, and possibly attempted violation of a statute. 

First, I need to understand the scenario. There's a student who's a practical joker. He has a habit of walking around campus late at night, dressed only in a raincoat and boxers. He approaches young women and flashes them by opening his raincoat, exposing himself in his shorts. Now, he thinks he's committing a crime because he's flashing himself in front of the co-eds. But according to the jurisdiction's law, it's a felony to flash or expose oneself in the nude. However, the student doesn't realize that what he's doing isn't a crime. 

Wait, that part is a bit confusing. The question says the student believed he was committing a crime by flashing himself, but in reality, it's a felony. So, the student doesn't know that his actions are illegal, but legally, he's committing a crime because he's exposing himself as per the statute. But wait, the problem states that in the jurisdiction, it's a felony to flash or expose oneself in the nude. So, the student's belief that he's committing a crime is correct because the law says it's a felony. But the twist is that the student thought he was committing a crime, but in reality, the law says it's a crime. So, maybe his belief doesn't matter because the law is clear. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating that part.

Moving on to the main event. One night, the student breaks into a sorority house intending to flash the sorority sisters. He's wearing only a raincoat and shorts. He enters the bedroom of one sister who's studying. She knows him and asks him what he's doing, suggesting he should be studying. He takes off his raincoat, says, "Study this, baby!" and starts running through the house in his shorts. The police arrive and arrest him.

Now, the question is, if the student is prosecuted, what crime(s) would he be guilty of?

The options are A through I, with various combinations of burglary, attempted violation, indecent exposure, and trespassing.

Let's break down the possible crimes.

First, burglary. In most jurisdictions, burglary is defined as unlawfully entering a building with the intent to commit a felony inside. The felony can be any crime, not necessarily violent. So, if the student broke into the sorority house with the intent to flash, which is a felony as per the statute, then his entry would constitute burglary.

Wait, but the student thought he was committing a crime by exposing himself. However, in reality, the act of exposing himself is a crime. So, his intent when entering the sorority house was to commit a felony (exposing himself), which satisfies the intent requirement for burglary.

So, that would mean he committed burglary.

Next, indecent exposure. Indecent exposure typically involves willfully exposing one's genitals in a public place or in view of others, which causes alarm or offense. Here, the student intended to flash the sisters, which is exposing himself. So, when he took off his raincoat and started running through the house in his shorts, he's committing indecent exposure.

Wait, but in this case, he was in a sorority house, which is a private place. Does that affect whether it's considered indecent exposure? Typically, indecent exposure requires that the exposure occurs in a place where it's likely to be seen by others, which could include private residences if others are present. Since the sister was in her bedroom studying, and he entered her room, he was in a private area but in the presence of another person. So, exposing himself there could still constitute indecent exposure.

Additionally, the student's actions when he took off his raincoat and ran through the house in his shorts would be the act of indecent exposure.

Now, what about the initial intent to flash? Since he intended to commit a felony (exposure) upon entering, that's burglary. But when he actually exposed himself, that's the commission of the felony, so he's guilty of both burglary and indecent exposure.

Wait, but the question is about what he's guilty of if prosecuted. So, he committed burglary by breaking in with intent to commit a felony (exposure). Then, he committed the felony of indecent exposure when he exposed himself.

Wait, but wait a minute. The student thought he was committing a crime, but the problem says that in the jurisdiction, it's a felony to flash or expose oneself. So, his actions are indeed illegal, so he's guilty of indecent exposure.

Now, looking at the options, option E is both burglary and indecent exposure. So, that would be E.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option G says both burglary and attempted violation. But if he actually committed the exposure, then it's not an attempt; it's the completed crime. So, burglary is complete upon unlawful entry with intent, and the exposure is the felony he intended to commit, so both would apply.

Wait, but let me think again. When he entered the house, he intended to commit indecent exposure, which is a felony. So, that's burglary. Then, once inside, he did commit indecent exposure by exposing himself. So, he's guilty of both.

So, the answer would be E: Both burglary and indecent exposure.

Wait, but let me check if there's any other angle. For example, could the act of entering the sorority house be considered trespassing instead of burglary? Trespassing is usually the unlawful entry onto property without permission, but without the intent to commit a felony. Burglary requires the intent to commit a felony upon entry. Since the student entered with the intent to flash, which is a felony, it's burglary, not just trespassing.

So, he's guilty of burglary and indecent exposure, making option E the correct answer.
</think>

The student committed two crimes: burglary and indecent exposure. He unlawfully entered the sorority house with the intent to commit a felony (exposing himself), satisfying the elements of burglary. Additionally, by exposing himself in the presence of others, he committed indecent exposure. Therefore, the correct answer is:

E: Both burglary and indecent exposure.

Answer: E
