Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The reaction given is the dissociation of N₂O₃ into NO₂ and NO. The equation is N₂O₃(g) ⇌ NO₂(g) + NO(g). At 298 K and one bar pressure, the degree of dissociation is 3.5 × 10⁻³. I need to find the standard Gibbs free change (ΔG°R) for this reaction. The options are from A to J, with various kJ/mol values.

Hmm, I remember that the degree of dissociation (α) is the fraction of the original reactant that dissociates. So in this case, N₂O₃ is dissociating into two products. The degree of dissociation being 0.0035 means that a small percentage of N₂O₃ breaks down into NO₂ and NO.

Wait, the formula for the degree of dissociation for a reaction like aA ⇌ bB + cC is α = (b + c) × (moles of A dissociated)/initial moles of A. But wait, in this case, since one mole of N₂O₃ produces one mole each of NO₂ and NO, the stoichiometry is 1 for each product. So the total moles produced per mole of N₂O₃ dissociated is 2 (1 mole of NO₂ and 1 of NO). So the degree of dissociation α = (1 + 1) × (moles dissociated)/(initial moles). Wait, no, wait. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

Wait, the degree of dissociation α is defined as the ratio of moles of NO₂ or NO to the moles of the reactant assuming no dissociation. Wait, but since each N₂O₃ molecule dissociates into two products, each with one mole, the total moles of products per mole of N₂O₃ dissociated is 2. But the degree of dissociation is defined as the ratio of the moles of either product to the initial moles of the reactant. Wait, but the problem states it's the ratio of the moles of NO₂ or NO to the moles of the reactant assuming no dissociation. Hmm, perhaps that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe it's the fraction of the reactant that dissociates, so α is the fraction that dissociates, so for each mole of N₂O₃ that dissociates, you get 1 mole of NO₂ and 1 mole of NO. That would mean that the total moles after dissociation would be (1 - α) moles of N₂O₃ and α moles of NO₂ and α moles of NO.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let's think in terms of stoichiometry. Let's say we start with 'n' moles of N₂O₃. At equilibrium, some of it dissociates into NO₂ and NO. Let's say 'x' moles of N₂O₃ dissociate. Then, according to the reaction, each mole of N₂O₃ gives one mole of NO₂ and one mole of NO. So, after dissociation, the moles would be:

N₂O₃: n - x
NO₂: x
NO: x

So the total moles of products (NO₂ + NO) would be 2x. The degree of dissociation α is the ratio of the moles of products to the initial moles of the reactant. Wait, but the problem says it's the ratio of the moles of NO₂ or NO to the moles of the reactant. Hmm, perhaps it's the mole fraction of the dissociated product relative to the initial. Wait, but the problem says "the ratio of moles of NO₂(g) or NO(g) to the moles of the reactant assuming no dissociation occurs." Hmm, that wording is a bit tricky.

Wait, perhaps the degree of dissociation is the fraction of N₂O₃ that has dissociated. So, if α is 0.0035, that means 0.35% of N₂O₃ has dissociated into NO₂ and NO. So the moles of NO₂ and NO would each be 0.0035 times the initial moles of N₂O₃.

Wait, but the degree of dissociation is often defined as the fraction that dissociates. So, if α is 3.5e-3, then for each mole of N₂O₃, 0.0035 moles dissociate, producing 0.0035 moles of NO₂ and 0.0035 moles of NO. So the total moles of products would be 2*0.0035 = 0.007 moles per initial mole of N₂O₃.

But maybe I should approach this using the equilibrium expression. Since the reaction is at equilibrium, I can relate the degree of dissociation to the equilibrium constant K.

The reaction is N₂O₃ ⇌ NO₂ + NO. Let's write the expression for K:

K = [NO₂][NO] / [N₂O₃]

Now, the degree of dissociation α is the fraction that dissociates. So, if we start with 'n' moles of N₂O₃, at equilibrium, the moles would be:

N₂O₃: n - αn = n(1 - α)
NO₂: αn
NO: αn

Assuming ideal gas behavior, the partial pressures are proportional to the moles. Let's assume total pressure is 1 bar, and we can express the partial pressures in terms of mole fractions and total pressure. But perhaps it's easier to express everything in terms of concentrations, but since the reaction is at standard pressure (1 bar), and we're dealing with pure gases, perhaps it's better to use the ideal gas law.

Alternatively, since the problem gives the degree of dissociation, perhaps I can express K in terms of α.

Let me think about the reaction quotient. At equilibrium, the concentrations (or partial pressures) are:

[N₂O₃] = (n(1 - α)) / V
[NO₂] = (αn) / V
[NO] = (αn) / V

So, substituting into K:

K = ( (αn/V) * (αn/V) ) / ( (n(1-α))/V )

Simplify this:

K = (α² n² / V²) * (V / (n(1 - α))) )
= (α² n) / (V (1 - α)) )

Wait, but I think I'm complicating things. Alternatively, since all gases are at the same volume and temperature, the pressure ratios can be considered as mole ratios. So, the partial pressure of N₂O₃ is (n(1 - α)) RT / V, and similarly for the products.

But perhaps a better approach is to express everything in terms of α. Let me consider the reaction in terms of extent of reaction ξ. The change per mole is:

N₂O₃: -ξ
NO₂: +ξ
NO: +ξ

So, at equilibrium, the moles are:

N₂O₃: n - ξ
NO₂: ξ
NO: ξ

The degree of dissociation α is ξ/n, so ξ = α n.

So, substituting ξ = α n into the expressions for each component.

Then, the partial pressures are:

[N₂O₃] = (n - ξ) RT / V = (n(1 - α)) RT / V
[NO₂] = ξ RT / V = α n RT / V
[NO] = ξ RT / V = α n RT / V

So, substituting into K:

K = ( [NO₂][NO] ) / [N₂O₃]
= ( (α n RT/V) * (α n RT/V) ) / ( (n(1 - α) RT/V) )
= ( α² n² (RT/V)^2 ) / (n (1 - α) RT/V )
= (α² n RT) ) / ( (1 - α) )

Wait, because when you divide, (RT/V)^2 divided by (RT/V) is (RT/V). So the expression becomes:

K = (α² n RT) / ( (1 - α) )

But I'm not sure if I'm approaching this correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that at standard conditions (1 bar), the partial pressures are expressed as:

[N₂O₃] = (n(1 - α)) RT / V
[NO₂] = (α n) RT / V
[NO] = (α n) RT / V

But maybe working with partial pressures is better than concentrations. Let me try that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express K in terms of the mole fractions, since the total pressure is 1 bar. Let's denote the total moles as n_total = (n(1 - α)) + α n + α n = n (1 - α + 2α) ) = n (1 + α )

So, the mole fractions are:

X_N2O3 = (n(1 - α)) / n_total = (1 - α) / (1 + α)
X_NO2 = α n / n_total = α / (1 + α)
X_NO = α n / n_total = α / (1 + α)

Since the total pressure is 1 bar, the partial pressures are:

P_N2O3 = X_N2O3 * P_total = (1 - α)/(1 + α) * 1 bar
P_NO2 = X_NO2 * P_total = α/(1 + α) * 1 bar
P_NO = X_NO * P_total = α/(1 + α) * 1 bar

Now, the equilibrium expression in terms of partial pressures is:

K_p = (P_NO2 * P_NO) / P_N2O3
= [ (α/(1+α)) * (α/(1+α)) ] / [ (1 - α)/(1+α) ) ]
= [ α² / (1 + α)^2 ] / [ (1 - α)/(1 + α) ) ]
= [ α² / (1 + α)^2 ] * [ (1 + α) / (1 - α) ) ]
= α² / [ (1 + α)(1 - α) ) ]
= α² / (1 - α² )

So K_p = α² / (1 - α² )

Now, the problem gives α = 3.5e-3, which is 0.0035. Let me compute K_p.

First, compute α²: (0.0035)^2 = 0.00001225

Then, 1 - α² = 1 - 0.00001225 = approximately 0.99998775

So K_p ≈ 0.00001225 / 0.99998775 ≈ 0.00001225 (since denominator is nearly 1).

So K_p ≈ 1.225e-5.

But wait, that seems very small. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, but the degree of dissociation is small, so K should be small, which makes sense.

Now, the next step is to relate K to ΔG°. The formula I remember is:

ΔG° = -RT ln K

But wait, wait, no, more precisely, ΔG° is the standard Gibbs free energy change, which is related to the equilibrium constant by:

ΔG° = -RT ln K

Wait, but wait, wait. Actually, the formula is ΔG° = -RT ln K, where K is the equilibrium constant. But wait, I should make sure about the sign. Because if the reaction is spontaneous in the forward direction, K would be greater than 1, and ΔG° would be negative.

In this case, since K is very small (about 1e-5), ΔG° would be positive, because ln K is negative, so -RT ln K is positive.

So, compute ΔG° as:

ΔG° = -RT ln K

But wait, wait, wait. Wait, no—let me check the formula again. Because sometimes it's written as ΔG° = RT ln K, but that's when K is expressed as [products]/[reactants]. Wait, no, the correct formula is ΔG° = -RT ln K, where K is the equilibrium constant.

Wait, but wait, the formula is ΔG° = -RT ln K, yes. So if K is small, ln K is negative, so ΔG° is positive.

So, plugging in the numbers:

R is the gas constant, 8.314 J/mol·K
T is 298 K
K ≈ 1.225e-5

Compute ln K:

ln(1.225e-5) ≈ ln(1.225) + ln(1e-5)
ln(1.225) ≈ 0.205
ln(1e-5) = -11.5129
So total ln K ≈ 0.205 -11.5129 ≈ -11.3079

So ln K ≈ -11.3079

Now, compute ΔG°:

ΔG° = - (8.314 J/mol·K) * (298 K) * (-11.3079)
= 8.314 * 298 * 11.3079

Wait, because two negatives make a positive.

Compute 8.314 * 298 first.

8.314 * 300 ≈ 2494.2, but 298 is 2 less, so 8.314 * 2 = 16.628, so 2494.2 - 16.628 ≈ 2477.572 J/mol.

Now, multiply by 11.3079:

2477.572 * 11.3079 ≈ ?

Let me compute roughly:

2477.572 * 10 = 24,775.72
2477.572 * 1 = 2,477.572
2477.572 * 0.3079 ≈ 2477.572 * 0.3 = 743.27, plus 2477.572 * 0.0079 ≈ ~19.53 → total ≈ 743.27 + 19.53 ≈ 762.8

So total ≈ 24,775.72 + 2,477.572 + 762.8 ≈ 24,775.72 + 3,240.37 ≈ 28,016.09 J/mol

Which is approximately 28,016 J/mol, which is 28.016 kJ/mol.

Wait, but let me check the exact calculation:

Compute 8.314 * 298 = ?

Let me compute 8.314 * 298:

298 = 300 - 2
8.314 * 300 = 2494.2
8.314 * 2 = 16.628
So, 2494.2 - 16.628 = 2477.572 J/mol·K

Then, 2477.572 * (-11.3079) → Wait, no, because ΔG° = -RT ln K, and ln K is negative, so ΔG° is positive.

Wait, I think I messed up the sign earlier. Let me recheck.

ΔG° = -RT * ln K

ln K is negative, so -RT * ln K becomes positive.

So, 8.314 * 298 = 2477.572 J/mol

Multiply by ln K = -11.3079 → 2477.572 * (-11.3079) = ?

Wait no, no, because ΔG° is -RT * ln K.

So ln K is negative, so ΔG° = -RT * (negative number) = positive RT * |ln K|.

So, 2477.572 * 11.3079 ≈ ?

Let me compute 2477.572 × 11.3079 accurately.

First, 2477.572 × 10 = 24,775.72
2477.572 × 1 = 2,477.572
2477.572 × 0.3079 = ?

Compute 2477.572 × 0.3 = 743.2716
2477.572 × 0.0079 = approximately 2477.572 * 0.008 = 19.820576, but subtract 2477.572 * 0.0001 = 0.2477572 → 19.820576 - 0.2477572 ≈ 19.57282

So 0.3079 × 2477.572 ≈ 743.2716 + 19.57282 ≈ 762.8444

Adding all together: 24,775.72 + 2,477.572 = 27,253.292 + 762.8444 ≈ 28,016.136 J/mol

So, ΔG° ≈ 28,016 J/mol → 28.016 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options, option G is 28 kJ/mol. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculation of K_p.

Earlier I had K_p = α² / (1 - α²). Let me recheck with α = 0.0035.

α = 0.0035 → α² = 0.00001225

1 - α² = 1 - 0.00001225 = 0.99998775

So K_p = 0.00001225 / 0.99998775 ≈ 0.00001225 (since 0.99998775 is very close to 1).

So yes, K_p ≈ 1.225e-5.

Then, ln K_p ≈ ln(1.225e-5) ≈ ln(1.225) + ln(1e-5) ≈ 0.205 -11.5129 ≈ -11.3079, which matches earlier.

So, RT is 8.314 * 298 ≈ 2477.572 J/mol.

Multiply by ln K_p: 2477.572 * (-11.3079) → but wait, no, ΔG° = -RT ln K. So with ln K being negative, ΔG° becomes positive.

So 2477.572 * 11.3079 ≈ 28,016 J/mol → 28.016 kJ/mol, which rounds to 28 kJ/mol. So option G is the answer.
</think>

To calculate the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for the dissociation of N₂O₃, we start by using the given degree of dissociation (α) and the relationship between the equilibrium constant (K) and ΔG°.

### Step 1: Relating α to K
The reaction is:

$$\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}_3(\mathrm{g}) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{NO}_2(\mathrm{g}) + \mathrm{NO}(\mathrm{g})$$

The degree of dissociation α is defined as the fraction of N₂O₃ that dissociates. At equilibrium, the partial pressures are proportional to the moles of each species. Using the stoichiometry of the reaction, the equilibrium constant \( K_p \) can be expressed in terms of α:

$$K_p = \frac{P_{\mathrm{NO}_2} \cdot P_{\mathrm{NO}}}{P_{\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}_3}} = \frac{\left(\frac{\alpha}{1+\alpha}\right)^2}{\frac{1-\alpha}{1+\alpha}} = \frac{\alpha^2}{1-\alpha^2}$$

Given α = \( 3.5 \times 10^{-3} \), we calculate:

\[
\alpha^2 = (3.5 \times 10^{-3})^2 = 1.225 \times 10^{-5}
\]
\[
1 - \alpha^2 = 1 - 1.225 \times 10^{-5} \approx 0.99998775
\]
\[
K_p = \frac{1.225 \times 10^{-5}}{0.99998775} \approx 1.225 \times 10^{-5}
\]

### Step 2: Relating K to ΔG°
The relationship between the equilibrium constant and the standard Gibbs free energy change is:

$$\Delta G^\circ = -RT \ln K_p$$

Where:
- \( R = 8.314 \, \mathrm{J/mol \cdot K} \)
- \( T = 298 \, \mathrm{K} \)
- \( K_p = 1.225 \times 10^{-5} \)

First, calculate \( \ln K_p \):

\[
\ln(1.225 \times 10^{-5}) = \ln(1.225) + \ln(10^{-5}) \approx 0.205 - 11.513 = -11.308
\]

Now, substitute into the equation for ΔG°:

\[
\Delta G^\circ = -(8.314)(298)(-11.308)
\]
\[
\Delta G^\circ = 8.314 \cdot 298 \cdot 11.308
\]

First, calculate \( R \cdot T \):

\[
R \cdot T = 8.314 \cdot 298 = 2477.572 \, \mathrm{J/mol}
\]

Then, multiply by \( \ln K_p \):

\[
\Delta G^\circ = 2477.572 \cdot 11.308 \approx 28,016 \, \mathrm{J/mol} = 28.016 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}
\]

### Final Answer:
The calculated value of \( \Delta G^\circ \) is approximately \( 28 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol} \), which corresponds to **option G**.
