Okay, so I've got this problem here about a water bed sale. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question says the water bed is available for $330 cash or a $40 down payment and $10.50 a month for 36 months. I need to find the annual interest rate charged. The options are A to J, with various percentages.

Wait, I remember that when comparing prices this way, we're probably dealing with the interest rate on the deferred payment. So the idea is that the cash price is $330, but you pay $40 upfront and then 36 monthly installments. I think this is a present value problem where the total amount paid in installments should equal the cash price.

Let me jot down what I know. The cash price is $330. The down payment is $40, so the amount you're paying upfront is $40, leaving the remaining amount to be paid over 36 months. So the total amount paid in installments is $330 - $40 = $290. But that's over 36 months, so the monthly payment is $10.50. Wait, but wait: 36 months is 3 years. But maybe the installments are monthly, so 36 months is $10.50 * 36 = let's calculate that. 10.50 times 36. 10 times 36 is 360, 0.50 times 36 is 18, so total is 378. Oh wait, but the cash price is 330, so the difference between the installment total and cash price is the interest.

Wait, let me think again. The total amount paid in installments is 36 * $10.50 = $378. The cash price is $330, but you're paying $40 down. So the net amount you're paying after the down payment is $330 - $40 = $290. But wait, that doesn't seem right. Because 36 months at $10.50 each adds up to 378, but the cash price is 330. So perhaps the present value of the 36 payments should equal $290. Because the cash price is $330, but you pay $40 upfront and then the installments, which are 36 months in total.

Wait, perhaps the formula to use is the present value of the deferred payments. The cash price is $330, and the present value of the 36 monthly payments is $290. So the difference is the interest. So the present value of an ordinary annuity (since the payments are made at the end of each month) is $290, and we can solve for the interest rate.

The formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is:

PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

Where PV is the present value, PMT is the monthly payment, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of periods.

In this case, PV is $290, PMT is $10.50, n is 36. We need to find r.

So plugging in the numbers:

290 = 10.50 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-36 ) / r ]

Hmm, solving for r here might be tricky. I think I'll need to use some trial and error or maybe a financial calculator. But since I don't have a calculator here, maybe I can approximate.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the total amount paid and the cash price. The cash price is 330, which is less than the total of the installments. So the difference is the interest. Wait, but the total installments are 36 * 10.50 = 378. So the present value of the installments is 290. So the difference between the installment payments and the cash price is 378 - 330 = 48. So that's the interest. But wait, no, because the cash price is the present value of the installments. So the present value of the installments is 290, which is less than the sum of $378. So the interest is the difference between 378 and 290, which is 88. So the total interest is 88 on the amount of 330. So the effective interest rate could be calculated as (88 / 330) * 100% = approximately 26.666...%. But that's the simple interest. But since the payments are made monthly, the effective annual rate would be higher because of compounding.

Wait, perhaps I should use the present value formula and solve for r. Let's try to approximate.

Let's try options given. Let's say the interest rate is 16.3% per annum. That's 1.3667% per month. Let's compute PV using this rate.

PV = 10.50 * [ (1 - (1 + 0.013667)^-36 ) / 0.013667 ]

Calculating (1 + 0.013667) is 1.013667. Raising that to -36th power is a bit tricky. Alternatively, maybe I can compute (1.013667)^36. Wait, 36 is a bit high, but maybe I can approximate.

Alternatively, maybe using logarithms or some approximation. But perhaps it's easier to think of the present value factor.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the rule of 78 or some other method, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I should set up the equation and test the options.

Let's think of the options. Let's take option B: 16.3% per annum, so monthly rate is 16.3 / 12 ≈ 1.3583% per month.

PV = 10.50 * [ (1 - (1 + 0.013583)^-36 ) / 0.013583 ]

Compute (1.013583)^36. Let's approximate. 1.013583^36. Let's see, 1.0136^36.

Alternatively, if I remember that ln(1+x) ≈ x - x²/2 + x³/3 - ..., but maybe that's overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity. Let me try to compute it.

Compute (1.013583)^36. Let's take it as approximately 1.536 (I'm not sure, but let's assume). So (1 + r)^-36 is 1/1.536 ≈ 0.651.

So 1 - 0.651 = 0.349.

Divide by r (0.013583): 0.349 / 0.013583 ≈ 25.75.

Multiply by 10.50: 25.75 * 10.50 ≈ 270.375. Hmm. But the PV should be 290. So that's a bit low.

Wait, maybe the rate is higher. Let me try a higher rate. Let's try option B again but perhaps a higher r.

Wait, maybe trying the 16.3% is too low. Let me think again. Wait, the present value of the payments is 290. So the interest is 88 over 330, which is about 26.67% over 3 years, but that's the simple interest. But since the payments are monthly, the effective annual rate would be higher due to interest on interest.

Wait, perhaps using another approach. The effective annual rate can be calculated using the formula:

(1 + (r/12))^12 - 1 = effective rate.

But I'm not sure if that's the best way.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the present value of an annuity. Let me set up the equation again.

PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

We have PV=290, PMT=10.50, n=36.

So:

290 = 10.50 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-36 ) / r ]

We can rearrange this equation to solve for r.

Divide both sides by 10.50:

290 / 10.50 ≈ 27.619 = [ (1 - (1 + r)^-36 ) / r ]

So:

27.619 = (1 - (1 + r)^-36 ) / r

Multiply both sides by r:

27.619 * r = 1 - (1 + r)^-36

Hmm. This equation is tricky to solve algebraically. Maybe I can approximate.

Let’s try r=0.013583 (1.3583% per month), as before. Let's compute 27.619 * 0.013583 = 0.375. Now, 1 - (1 + 0.013583)^-36. We said that (1.013583)^36 ≈ 1.536, so (1.536)^-1 ≈ 0.651. Thus, 1 - 0.651 = 0.349. So 0.375 vs 0.349. Close, but not equal. So r is a bit higher. Let me try 1.36% per month.

r=0.0136.

27.619 * 0.0136 = 0.375 (approx 0.375).

(1.0136)^36. Let me compute it step by step.

(1.0136)^12 ≈ e^(0.12 * 0.0136) → Wait, no, that's for continuous compounding. Alternatively, perhaps use logarithms.

log(1.0136) ≈ 0.01341.

Multiply by 36: 0.48276. So e^0.48276 ≈ 1.622.

So (1.0136)^36 ≈ 1.622.

So (1.0136)^-36 ≈ 1/1.622 ≈ 0.6166.

So 1 - 0.6166 = 0.3834.

So 27.619 * 0.0136 ≈ 0.375, but 0.3834 is what we actually have, so the left side is lower. So the actual r is a bit lower than 1.36%. Hmm. So maybe the actual r is around 1.35%.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Maybe I can try r=0.0135 (1.35% per month).

(1.0135)^36.

log(1.0135) ≈ 0.01349.

Multiply by 36: 0.4856 → e^0.4856 ≈ 1.625.

So (1.0135)^36 ≈1.625 → (1.0135)^-36 ≈0.6154.

So 1 - 0.6154 =0.3846.

Then 27.619 * 0.0135 ≈ 0.373.

But the left side is 0.373, and the right side is 0.3846. So 0.373 < 0.3846. So the actual r is a bit higher than 1.35%, so maybe 1.355% per month.

Let me try r=0.01355.

(1.01355)^36.

log(1.01355)=approx 0.01352.

36 * 0.01352=0.48672.

e^0.48672 ≈1.626.

So (1.01355)^36 ≈1.626, (1.01355)^-36 ≈0.6159.

1-0.6159=0.3841.

27.619 * 0.01355= ~0.375.

Hmm, 0.375 is less than 0.3841, so r is a bit higher than 1.355%.

Wait, so the left side is 27.619 * r, which is 27.619 * 0.01355 ≈ 0.375. But the right side is 0.3841. So 0.375 < 0.3841, so the actual r is a bit higher than 1.355%.

Wait, but this is getting too time-consuming and perhaps I'm making a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should use an approximation formula.

Wait, another approach: the present value is 290, which is the value of the 36 monthly payments. So the effective interest rate can be found by finding the rate that makes the present value of $10.50 per month equal to $290.

Alternatively, perhaps using the annuity formula.

Wait, perhaps using a different approach: the total amount paid is 36 *10.50=378. The cash price is 330. So the extra is 48, which is the interest. So the total interest is 48 over 3 years, which is 16% per annum. But that's simple interest. But since payments are monthly, the effective rate would be higher.

Wait, but 16% is option B. But option B is 16.3%. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the effective rate is calculated as (1 + r)^12 -1. So let me think about that.

Wait, the total amount paid is 378, and the cash price is 330, so the interest is 48 over 3 years, which is 16% per annum. But because the payments are monthly, the effective rate is higher than 16%.

Wait, so perhaps the effective annual rate is higher than 16%, so perhaps 17.8% (option J) is the answer. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 48 dollars is the interest over 3 years, so 48/36 =1.333 per month. So the monthly interest rate is 1.333%. But that's just the simple interest. The effective annual rate would be (1 + 0.01333)^12 -1.

Calculating that:

(1.01333)^12. Let me compute that.

Using the rule of 72, perhaps, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach.

1.01333^12.

I'll approximate:

1.01333^2 = approx 1.0268.

^4: (1.0268)^2 ≈ 1.0543.

^8: (1.0543)^2 ≈ 1.1114.

^12: (1.1114)*(1.0268)^4 → 1.1114 * 1.0543 ≈ 1.1722.

So 1.01333^12 ≈ 1.1722.

So the effective rate is 17.22% per annum. That's approximately 17.2% which isn't exactly any of the options, but option J is 17.8%. Hmm, but perhaps I made an approximation error.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 16.3% (option B), but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again. The present value of the 36 installments is 290. So the rate is such that the PV of 10.50 for 36 months is 290.

So, perhaps using the formula:

PV = PMT * [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r

With PV=290, PMT=10.50, n=36.

So,

290 = 10.50 * [1 - (1 + r)^-36 ] / r

Let me rearrange:

[1 - (1 + r)^-36 ] / r = 290 / 10.50 ≈ 27.619

So,

1 - (1 + r)^-36 = 27.619 * r

But solving for r is complicated. Maybe I can try r=16.3/12=1.3583% per month.

Plugging into the left side:

1 - (1.013583)^-36 = 1 - [1/(1.013583)^36 ]

We calculated (1.013583)^36 ≈1.536, so 1/(1.536)=0.651.

So 1 - 0.651 = 0.349.

Multiply by r=0.013583: 0.349 * 0.013583≈ 0.00476. But 0.00476 is way less than 27.619. So that can't be. So the rate is much higher than 1.3583%.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try the options again.

Option B: 16.3% per annum.

So, monthly rate is 1.3583%.

Compute 290 = 10.50 * [1 - (1.013583)^-36 ] / 0.013583.

Compute (1.013583)^-36 = 1/(1.013583)^36.

(1.013583)^36 ≈ 1.536 → 1/1.536≈0.651.

So [1 - 0.651 ]=0.349.

So 10.50 * (0.349 / 0.013583 ) = 10.50 * (25.75)≈270.375.

But the PV should be 290, which is higher. So the actual rate is lower than 1.3583% because if the rate were lower, the denominator would be smaller, making the whole fraction larger, thus the PV would be larger. Wait, no, the PV should be 290. So in this case, the PV is 270.375 with the rate at 1.3583%, which is less than 290. So the actual rate is higher than 1.3583%, which would make the denominator larger and the whole fraction smaller, thus the PV smaller.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me try a higher rate. Let me try option B again but maybe a lower rate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 16.3% per annum, as option B.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think of the formula again.

The present value of the 36 installments is 290.

So, 290 = 10.50 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-36 ) / r ]

I can rearrange this to solve for r, but it's a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Newton-Raphson method to approximate.

Let me define:

f(r) = 290 - 10.50 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-36 ) / r ]

We need to find r where f(r)=0.

We can pick an initial guess, say r0=0.013583 (1.3583% per month), which is 16.3% per annum.

Compute f(r0):

First compute (1 + r0)^36 = (1.013583)^36 ≈1.536.

So,

(1 - (1.013583)^-36 ) / r0 = (1 - 1/1.536)/0.013583 = (1 - 0.651)/0.013583 ≈ 0.349 / 0.013583 ≈25.75.

So f(r0) = 290 - 10.50 *25.75 = 290 - 270.375 = 19.625.

So f(r0)=19.625>0.

We need to find r where f(r)=0.

Take another guess, say r1=0.0136 (1.36% per month).

Compute (1 + r1)^36 = (1.0136)^36 ≈1.622.

(1 - (1.0136)^-36 ) / r1 = (1 - 1/1.622 )/0.0136 = (1 - 0.6166)/0.0136 ≈0.3834 / 0.0136 ≈28.22.

f(r1)=290 -10.50 *28.22 =290 - 298.21= -8.21.

So f(r1)= -8.21.

Now, since f(r0)=19.625>0 and f(r1)=-8.21<0, the root is between r0 and r1.

Using linear approximation:

Between r0 and r1, the change in f(r) is 19.625 - (-8.21) =27.835 over a change in r of 0.0001 (1.36% -1.3583=0.0017% per month).

Wait, no, the change in r is 0.0001 (1.36% -1.3583=0.0017% per month). Wait, no, 1.36% per month is 0.0136, and 1.3583% is 0.013583. So the difference is 0.000017 per month, which is about 0.0017% per month. So for a small delta_r, the delta_f is approximately f'(r)*delta_r.

So, to find the root, we can use the secant method.

The values at r0 and r1 are f0=19.625 and f1=-8.21.

The slope between r0 and r1 is (f1 - f0) / (r1 - r0) )= (-8.21 -19.625)/(0.000017) = (-27.835)/(0.000017) ≈ -27.835 / 0.000017 ≈-1637411.76.

Wait, that's a huge slope, but the change in r is 0.000017, which is 0.000017 per month.

So to find the root, we can use:

r = r0 - f0/(m) where m is the slope.

Wait, the formula for the root is:

r = r0 - (f0) / (m), where m is the slope.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the formulas. Let me think again.

The linear approximation between r0 and r1:

f(r) ≈ f0 + (f1 - f0)/(r1 - r0) (r - r0)

We set f(r)=0.

So,

0 = f0 + (f1 - f0)/(r1 - r0) (r - r0)

=> r = r0 - f0/( (f1 - f0)/(r1 - r0) ) )

= r0 - f0 * (r1 - r0)/(f1 - f0 )

= r0 + [ f0 (r1 - r0) ]/(f0 - f1 )

Because f1 - f0 = -(f0 - f1).

So,

r = r0 + (f0 (r1 - r0) ) / (f0 - f1 )

Now, plugging in:

r0 = 0.013583

r1 = 0.0136

f0=19.625

f1=-8.21

So,

r = 0.013583 + (19.625 * (0.0136 - 0.013583 )) / (19.625 - (-8.21) )

Compute numerator:

19.625 * (0.000017) = 19.625 * 1.7e-5 = approximately 0.0003336.

Denominator:

19.625 +8.21 =27.835.

So,

r = 0.013583 + 0.0003336 /27.835.

0.0003336 /27.835 ≈1.197e-5.

So,

r ≈0.013583 + 0.00001197 ≈0.013595, which is 1.3595% per month.

So the rate is approximately 1.3595% per month, which is 1.3595 *12= 16.32% per annum.

Wait, that's about 16.32% per annum. Looking at the options, option B is 16.3%, option J is 17.8%.

Hmm, but our calculation gives approximately 16.32% per annum, which is 16.3%, which matches option B. But wait, I'm not sure if that's accurate because the formula is approximate.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact answer is 16.3%, which is option B. But I'm not entirely confident because I made approximations in the calculations.

Wait, another approach: using the formula:

Effective annual rate = (1 + r)^12 - 1.

We can compute the effective rate from the present value of the installments.

Given that:

PV = 10.50 * [1 - (1 + r)^-36 ] / r =290.

We can solve for r using the formula, but it's a bit tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps using trial and error.

We can try r=16.3% per annum.

So, r=0.163.

Compute (1 + 0.163)^12 -1.

(1.163)^12.

Compute using logarithms.

ln(1.163)=approx 0.1523.

12 *0.1523=1.8276.

Exp(1.8276)= approx 6.245.

So,

(1.163)^12 -1=6.245-1=5.245.

Which is the effective rate.

But that's not relevant. Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the effective rate as (1 + (r/12))^12 -1.

Wait, using the actual r per month, which we found to be approximately 1.3595% per month.

So,

(1 + (1.3595/12))^12 -1 = (1 + 0.113292)^12 -1.

Compute 1.113292^12.

1.113292^12.

Let me compute this step by step.

1.113292^2 = approx 1.239.

1.113292^4 = (1.239)^2 ≈ 1.535.

1.113292^8 = (1.535)^2 ≈2.356.

1.113292^12 = 2.356 *1.239 ≈2.922.

So,

(1.113292)^12 -1 ≈2.922 -1=1.922.

So, the effective annual rate is 192.2%, which is way higher than any of the options.

Wait, that's impossible because the present value should be less than 290.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the calculation of the effective rate.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the effective annual rate from the present value of the installments.

Wait, perhaps using the formula:

Effective annual rate = [(1 + r)^n -1]/n, where r is the monthly rate.

So, in this case, the present value is 290, and the future value is 378.

Wait, no. The present value is 290, and the future value is 378.

Wait, but the present value of an ordinary annuity is 290.

So, the formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is:

PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

We can rearrange this to solve for r.

But perhaps it's easier to use a calculator.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula:

r = [(1 + r)^n / PV] -1.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the effective annual rate.

The present value of the installments is 290, and the future value is 378.

Wait, no. The present value is 290, and the future value is 378.

But I'm not sure how to calculate the effective annual rate from that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the effective annual rate as the rate that would make the present value equal to the future value.

But that's not correct, because the present value is 290 and the future value is 378.

Wait, no, the present value is 290, and the future value is 378, but the cash price is 330.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should consider that the correct answer is 16.3%, which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps I should choose option J, 17.8%, because it's the closest to my approximation.

Wait, but I'm not sure. I think I should go with the best estimate I have, which is 16.3% per annum, which is option B.

But I'm not entirely confident, because the calculation gave me approximately 16.32%, which is 16.3%, so option B.
</think>

The correct answer is **B) 16.3%**.

**Explanation:**

The problem involves comparing the cash price of an item (330) with the total cost of purchasing it in installments (330 + 10.50 × 36 = 378). To find the annual interest rate, we calculate the effective annual rate (EAR) using the present value of the installments.

The present value formula for an ordinary annuity is:

\[
PV = PMT \times \left[ \frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r} \right]
\]

Where:
- \(PV = 290\)
- \(PMT = 10.50\)
- \(n = 36\)
- \(r\) is the monthly interest rate.
