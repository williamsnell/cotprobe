Alright, so I've got this problem here about vector spaces and linear independence. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The problem says that V is a vector space over the real numbers R. We have three vectors u1, u2, u3 in V, and they're linearly independent. That's good to know because linear independence tells us that none of these vectors can be written as a combination of the others. 

Now, the question is asking about the rank of another vector group formed by transforming these original vectors. The new vectors are u1 - λu2, u2 - λu3, and u3 - λu1. We need to find the rank for two specific values of λ: λ = sqrt(5) and λ = 1. Then, return the answer as a list where the first element is the rank for sqrt(5) and the second for 1.

First, let me recall what the rank of a vector group means. The rank is the maximum number of linearly independent vectors in that group. So, I need to determine how many of these transformed vectors are linearly independent for each λ.

Let me denote the vectors as follows for clarity:
v1 = u1 - λu2
v2 = u2 - λu3
v3 = u3 - λu1

Since u1, u2, u3 are linearly independent, they form a basis for a 3-dimensional subspace of V. But when we apply these transformations, the new vectors might not be independent anymore, so their rank could be less than 3.

Hmm, maybe I can set up a matrix where each column is one of these transformed vectors and then compute its determinant. If the determinant is non-zero, the vectors are linearly independent, so the rank is 3. If the determinant is zero, they are dependent, so the rank is less than 3.

Let me try that approach. Let's construct the matrix M whose columns are v1, v2, v3. So,

M = [v1 | v2 | v3]
   = [u1 - λu2 | u2 - λu3 | u3 - λu1]

Since u1, u2, u3 are linearly independent, I can express M in terms of the original vectors. Let me represent each vector as a column vector in terms of the basis {u1, u2, u3}. Wait, actually, that might complicate things because I don't know the specific basis. Maybe a better approach is to express this transformation as a matrix operation on the original vectors.

Alternatively, I can think of the transformation as a linear combination. Let me write M as a linear combination of the identity matrix and some other matrix. Wait, perhaps it's easier to write the matrix M in terms of the original vectors.

Wait, perhaps I can write M as:

M = [u1 - λu2, u2 - λu3, u3 - λu1]

If I arrange this as a matrix, each column is a vector. Let me think of each vector in the standard basis, but since I don't have the standard basis, maybe I can instead look at the coefficients when expressing these vectors in terms of u1, u2, u3.

Wait, that's a good point. Let me represent each transformed vector in terms of the original basis. So, for example:

v1 = u1 - λu2 → coefficients are [1, -λ, 0]
v2 = u2 - λu3 → coefficients are [0, 1, -λ]
v3 = u3 - λu1 → coefficients are [-λ, 0, 1]

So, the matrix M in terms of the original basis would be a 3x3 matrix where each row corresponds to the coefficients of u1, u2, u3 in each transformed vector. Wait, no, actually, each column corresponds to v1, v2, v3. So M would look like:

M = [1    0    -λ
     -λ   1     0
      0   -λ    1]

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me correct that. Each column is the coefficients of u1, u2, u3 in the respective transformed vector. So:

v1 is 1*u1 + (-λ)*u2 + 0*u3 → first column is [1, -λ, 0]
v2 is 0*u1 + 1*u2 + (-λ)*u3 → second column is [0, 1, -λ]
v3 is (-λ)*u1 + 0*u2 + 1*u3 → third column is [-λ, 0, 1]

So the matrix M is:

[ 1    0    -λ ]
[-λ   1     0 ]
[ 0   -λ    1 ]

Wait, no, wait: Each column is [coeff of u1; coeff of u2; coeff of u3]. So the first column is [1, -λ, 0], second is [0, 1, -λ], third is [-λ, 0, 1]. So the matrix is:

Row 1: 1, 0, -λ
Row 2: -λ, 1, 0
Row 3: 0, -λ, 1

So M is:

[ 1    0     -λ ]
[-λ    1      0 ]
[ 0    -λ    1 ]

Now, the determinant of M will tell me if the columns are linearly independent. If det(M) ≠ 0, then the rank is 3. If det(M) = 0, then the rank is less than 3.

So, let's compute the determinant of M for both λ = sqrt(5) and λ = 1.

The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated using the rule of Sarrus or expansion by minors. Let's expand along the first row.

det(M) = 1 * det(minor of 1) - 0 * det(minor of 0) + (-λ) * det(minor of -λ)

The minor for 1 (element at M[1,1]) is the submatrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 1:

[1    0 ]
[-λ   1 ]

The determinant of this 2x2 matrix is (1)(1) - (0)(-λ) = 1.

The minor for 0 (element at M[1,2]) is:

[-λ    0 ]
[ 0    1 ]

But since it's multiplied by 0, this term doesn't contribute.

The minor for -λ (element at M[1,3]) is the submatrix after removing row 1 and column 3:

[-λ    1 ]
[ 0    -λ ]

The determinant of this is (-λ)(-λ) - (1)(0) = λ².

So, putting it all together:

det(M) = 1*(1) + (-λ)*(λ²) = 1 - λ³

Wait, wait a minute. Let me double-check the signs.

The expansion is:

det(M) = 1 * det( [1, 0; -λ, 1] ) - 0 * (...) + (-λ) * det( [-λ, 1; 0, -λ] )

So, 1*(1) + (-λ)*( (-λ)(-λ) - (1)(0) ) → 1 + (-λ)*(λ²) → 1 - λ³.

Yes, that's correct. So det(M) = 1 - λ³.

So, the determinant is zero when 1 - λ³ = 0 → λ³ = 1 → λ = 1 (since we're working over R, and cube roots are unique here).

Wait, but wait, λ = 1 is a real root, but there are also complex roots, but since we're dealing with real fields, only real roots matter. So λ = 1 is the only real root.

So, for λ = 1, det(M) = 1 - 1 = 0. Therefore, the vectors are linearly dependent, so the rank is less than 3.

What about when λ = sqrt(5)? Let's compute det(M):

det(M) = 1 - (sqrt(5))³ = 1 - (5 * sqrt(5)).

Wait, (sqrt(5))³ is sqrt(5) * sqrt(5) * sqrt(5) = 5 * sqrt(5). So 1 - 5*sqrt(5) is definitely not zero because 5*sqrt(5) is about 11.18, so 1 - 11.18 is negative, but not zero. So det(M) ≠ 0, which means the vectors are linearly independent, so the rank is 3.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me recalculate the determinant.

The expansion was:

det(M) = 1*(1*1 - 0*(-λ)) - 0*(...) + (-λ)*((-λ)*(-λ) - 1*0)
= 1*(1) + 0 + (-λ)*(λ²)
= 1 - λ³.

Yes, that's correct.

So, for λ = sqrt(5), det(M) = 1 - (sqrt(5))^3 = 1 - (5 * sqrt(5)) ≈ 1 - 11.18 ≈ -10.18, which is not zero. So the determinant is non-zero, so the vectors are linearly independent, so the rank is 3.

For λ = 1, det(M) = 1 - 1 = 0, so the vectors are linearly dependent, so the rank is less than 3. Now, what is the rank in this case?

When the determinant is zero, the vectors are linearly dependent, so the rank could be 2 or 1 or 0. But since the original vectors u1, u2, u3 are independent, let's see if any two of the transformed vectors are independent.

Let me check when λ=1.

The vectors become:

v1 = u1 - u2
v2 = u2 - u3
v3 = u3 - u1

Let me check if these are linearly dependent. Let's see if a combination a*v1 + b*v2 + c*v3 = 0.

But let's see another approach: perhaps the rank is 2. Let me see if any two vectors are independent.

Take v1 and v2. Are they independent?

Suppose a*v1 + b*v2 = 0.

a(u1 - u2) + b(u2 - u3) = 0
= a u1 + (-a + b) u2 + (-b) u3 = 0

Since u1, u2, u3 are independent, their coefficients must be zero.

So:
a = 0
-a + b = 0 → since a=0, b=0
-b = 0 → b=0

So, v1 and v2 are independent. Therefore, the rank is at least 2.

Now, let's check if all three are dependent. Since the determinant is zero, they are dependent, so the maximum rank is 2.

So, for λ=1, the rank is 2.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me think again. Are v1, v2, v3 dependent when λ=1?

We can check if v3 is a linear combination of v1 and v2.

v3 = u3 - u1.

Let me express this in terms of v1 and v2.

v1 = u1 - u2 → u1 = v1 + u2
v2 = u2 - u3 → u3 = u2 - v2

So, v3 = (u3) - u1 = (u2 - v2) - (v1 + u2) ) = u2 - v2 - v1 - u2 = -v1 - v2.

So, v3 = -v1 - v2. Therefore, v1, v2, v3 are linearly dependent when λ=1. So, the rank is 2.

Putting it all together:

For λ = sqrt(5), rank is 3.

For λ = 1, rank is 2.

So the list is [3, 2].

Looking back at the options, option C is [3,2], which matches.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the determinant. Let me compute it again.

Matrix M for general λ is:

[ 1    0     -λ ]
[-λ    1      0 ]
[ 0    -λ    1 ]

Calculating the determinant:

= 1*(1*1 - 0*(-λ)) - 0*(-λ*1 - 0*0) + (-λ)*(-λ*(-λ) - 1*0)
= 1*(1) - 0 + (-λ)*(λ² - 0)
= 1 - λ³

Yes, that's correct. So when λ=1, det=0; for λ=sqrt(5), det=1 - (sqrt(5))^3 = 1 - 5*sqrt(5) ≈ -10.18, which is non-zero.

Thus, the ranks are 3 and 2, respectively. So the answer should be [3,2], which is option C.
</think>

The vectors u1, u2, u3 are linearly independent. We form new vectors v1 = u1 - λu2, v2 = u2 - λu3, v3 = u3 - λu1. To find their rank, we construct a matrix M with columns v1, v2, v3. Expressing M in terms of the original vectors, we get:

M = [1    0    -λ]
    [-λ   1     0]
    [0    -λ    1]

The determinant of M is det(M) = 1 - λ³. 

- For λ = √5, det(M) = 1 - (√5)³ ≈ -10.18 ≠ 0, so the vectors are linearly independent, and the rank is 3.
- For λ = 1, det(M) = 0, so the vectors are linearly dependent. Checking linear independence of subsets, we find the rank is 2.

Thus, the ranks are [3, 2].
