Okay, so I need to figure out the manufacturer's increase over the cost for these hiking boots. Let me see. The problem says the boots cost $25 to produce, and the company wants to sell them for 15% more than the production cost. I think I need to calculate 15% of $25 and that will give me the increase.

Hmm, right, 15% of $25. So, percentages can sometimes trip me up, but I remember that to find a percentage of a number, I multiply the percentage (as a decimal) by the number. So 15% is 0.15 in decimal form.

Let me calculate 0.15 times 25. Let's see, 25 times 0.1 is 2.5, and 25 times 0.05 is 1.25. Adding those together, 2.5 plus 1.25 equals 3.75. So the increase is $3.75.

Wait, but let me double-check that. Another way is to think, what number is 15% of 25. So 10% of 25 is 2.5, and 5% is 1.25, so adding those gives 3.75. Yep, that's the same result.

Looking at the options, J is $3.75. So that must be the correct answer.

The manufacturer's increase over the cost is calculated by finding 15% of $25. This equals $3.75, which corresponds to option J.
