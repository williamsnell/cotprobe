Question:

Brown cosigned Royal's $50000 note to State Bank. If Royal is later adjudicated mentally incompetent what would be Brown's liability on the note?

Options:

A: Liable to pay State only if State first seeks payment from Royal.
B: Not liable to pay State as Brown was only a voluntary surety.
C: Liable to pay State only if Royal fails to meet the payment deadline.
D: Not liable to pay State, as Royal's mental incompetency releases all cosigners from liability.
E: Not liable to pay State unless Brown was a compensated surety.
F: Liable to pay State, but only half of the note due to Royal's mental incompetency.
G: Not liable to pay State because Royal's incompetency discharges Royal as a surety.
H: Liable to pay State on the due date of the note.
I: Not liable to pay State, as Brown's liability is dependent on Royal's mental competency at the time of signing.
J: Liable to pay State, but only if Royal's assets are insufficient to cover the debt.

Okay, so I have this question about suretyship and mental incompetence. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question says that Brown cosigned a $50,000 note for Royal with State Bank. Later, Royal is adjudicated as mentally incompetent. The question is about Brown's liability on the note.

First, I need to remember what cosigning means. When someone cosigns a loan, they're basically a surety. That means if the primary borrower (Royal) can't pay, the cosigner (Brown) is responsible for the debt. So Brown is secondarily liable.

Now, the issue here is Royal's mental incompetency. I think mental incompetence can affect liability, but I'm not sure exactly how. I remember that in contract law, if someone lacks the mental capacity to understand what they're signing, the contract might be voidable. But as a surety, does that affect the cosigner's responsibility?

Wait, in suretyship, the surety is still on the hook unless there's a defense. One defense could be if the principal's inability to pay is due to something that makes the contract void. But I'm not sure if mental incompetence of the principal (Royal) would discharge the surety (Brown).

Let me think about the options. Option B says Brown isn't liable because he was a voluntary surety. But being voluntary doesn't necessarily mean he's off the hook if Royal can't pay. So I don't think B is correct.

Option D says Brown isn't liable because Royal's incompetency releases all cosigners. That sounds like it's suggesting that Royal's inability due to incompetence would relieve the surety. But I think sureties are generally liable unless there's a specific reason, like the principal's incapacity rendering the note void.

Option I says Brown isn't liable if Royal's mental competency was at the time of signing. Wait, the question is about Royal's current incompetency, not at the time of signing. So if Royal was competent when he signed, his later incompetency might not affect Brown's liability.

Option E says Brown isn't liable unless he was a compensated surety. I don't think compensation is the issue here. The question doesn't mention if Brown was paid, so E might not be the right choice.

Option J says Brown is liable only if Royal's assets are insufficient. So the bank would first go after Royal, and if he can't pay, then Brown would be liable. That sounds like the general rule, but I'm not sure if Royal's incompetency changes that.

Option C says Brown is liable only if Royal fails to pay. That seems like the usual case, but does Royal's incompetency change that? If Royal is incompetent, maybe the bank can't collect from him, so they'd go after Brown directly.

Wait, but in some cases, if the principal's inability is due to incompetence, the surety might have a defense. I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think: if the note is void because Royal couldn't understand it, then maybe Brown isn't liable. But I'm not sure if the note would be void because of mental incompetence.

I think generally, a surety remains liable unless the principal's contract is found to be void. If Royal's note is void due to incompetence, then Brown as surety might not be liable. But I'm not certain. 

Looking back at the options, option D says that Royal's incompetency releases all cosigners. If that's the case, Brown wouldn't have to pay. But I'm not sure if that's the law.

Alternatively, option H says Brown is liable on the due date. That sounds like the default position without considering Royal's incompetence. But if Royal can't pay because of incompetence, does that affect it?

Wait, maybe the key is that Royal's incompetence doesn't discharge the surety. So Brown is still liable. So looking at the options, H says Brown is liable on the due date. But the question is about what happens when Royal is incompetent. So the bank would still look to Brown for payment if Royal can't pay.

Alternatively, option J says Brown is liable only if Royal's assets are insufficient. So the bank would first try to collect from Royal, but if he's incompetent, maybe they can't. So the bank might go directly to Brown.

But I'm not sure. Another angle: in some jurisdictions, the surety is only liable if the principal is unable to pay, but the principal's inability here is due to incompetence. So if the note is voidable, the surety might not be liable. 

Wait, but if Royal is adjudicated mentally incompetent, that might mean a guardian or someone else is handling his affairs. So perhaps the bank can still pursue Royal through his estate or guardian, but if they can't get payment, then Brown would be liable.

Alternatively, maybe Royal's incompetence doesn't affect Brown's liability because the note is still a valid debt, just that Royal can't manage it. So Brown would still have to pay if Royal fails.

I think the correct answer is that Brown remains liable because the cosigner is a surety and the principal's incompetence doesn't relieve the surety unless the note is void. But if Royal was competent at the time of signing, the note is valid, and Brown's liability isn't discharged by Royal's later incompetence.

So looking at the options, option H says Brown is liable on the due date. But the question is about when Royal is incompetent. So does that change anything? Or is Brown still liable regardless?

Alternatively, option J says Brown is liable only if Royal's assets are insufficient. So the bank first goes after Royal, but if he can't pay because of incompetence, Brown is liable.

Wait, but the bank might have to exhaust Royal's assets first. So if Royal's estate can't pay, Brown has to. So J would make sense in that case.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: if Royal's incompetence makes him unable to perform, but the note is still a valid obligation, Brown is still on the hook. So the bank can choose to go after Brown if Royal can't pay. So option J says Brown is liable only if Royal's assets are insufficient, which aligns with the idea that the bank would first try to collect from Royal.

So maybe the correct answer is J. But I'm not 100% certain.

Wait, but the law regarding sureties and mental incompetency: I think that the surety is still liable unless the principal's contract is void. If Royal's note is still valid, Brown is liable. So if the note isn't void, Brown has to pay if Royal can't.

So in that case, the answer might be J because the bank would first seek from Royal, and if he can't pay (due to incompetence, meaning his assets are insufficient or he can't manage them), then Brown would have to pay.

Alternatively, some states might allow the surety to be off the hook if the principal's incompetence makes the principal's obligation void. But I'm not sure.

Hmm. I'm leaning towards J because the bank would have to try to collect from Royal first, and if he can't pay (maybe because his assets are controlled by a guardian, but perhaps they're insufficient), then Brown is liable.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another angle: if Royal is mentally incompetent, the contract might be considered voidable, which could affect the surety. But I think sureties are liable unless the principal's contract is void, which might not be the case here.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to remember: in general, a surety's liability is not affected by the principal's inability to pay unless the principal's inability is due to a defense that would void the principal's obligation. If Royal's note is still valid, Brown is liable.

So if Royal is incompetent, but the note is still valid, Brown is still liable. So the bank can come after Brown if Royal can't pay.

Looking at the options, option H says Brown is liable on the due date. That seems to suggest that regardless of Royal's situation, Brown has to pay when the note is due.

But that doesn't consider whether the bank tried to collect from Royal first. Option J says Brown is liable only if Royal's assets are insufficient, which implies the bank would first go after Royal.

I think in practice, the bank would first try to collect from the primary obligor (Royal) and then from the surety (Brown) if needed. So if Royal's assets are insufficient, Brown is liable.

Therefore, the correct answer is J.

The question revolves around Brown's liability as a cosigner (surety) for Royal's $50,000 note with State Bank, given that Royal is later adjudicated mentally incompetent. Cosigning a note makes the cosigner secondarily liable, meaning they are responsible for the debt if the primary borrower cannot pay. The key issue is whether Royal's mental incompetence affects Brown's liability.

Mental incompetence can sometimes void a contract if the individual lacked the capacity to understand it at the time of signing. However, the question does not indicate that Royal was incompetent at the time of signing, so the note likely remains valid. Generally, a surety's liability is not discharged unless the principal's obligation is void. If the note is still valid, Brown remains liable.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option J** states that Brown is liable only if Royal's assets are insufficient. This aligns with the principle that the bank would first attempt to collect from Royal. If Royal, due to incompetence, cannot pay, the bank would then pursue Brown. This seems correct because it reflects the typical process of exhausting the primary obligor's assets before seeking payment from the surety.

- **Option H** suggests Brown is liable on the due date regardless of Royal's situation. While Brown is indeed liable, this option does not account for the usual practice of first pursuing the primary obligor, making it less precise.

Given the analysis, the most accurate answer is that Brown is liable only if Royal's assets are insufficient to cover the debt.
