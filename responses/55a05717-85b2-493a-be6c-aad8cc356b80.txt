Alright, let's tackle this question. The question is about identifying which food doesn't contain free sugars. Free sugars are sugars added to foods, not the naturally occurring ones. So I need to go through each option and see if they have added sugars or just natural ones.

Option A: White bread. I know white bread is made from wheat, which naturally has some sugars, but during processing, they usually add more sugar, especially in the form of yeast food or other additives. So white bread likely contains free sugars.

Option B: Canned fruit in syrup. These are definitely sweetened because the syrup is added. So free sugars here.

Option C: Maple syrup. That's just a type of syrup, which is a concentrated sugar. So yes, free sugars.

Option D: Honey. Similar to syrup, honey is a natural sweetener but it's considered a free sugar because it's added to foods. So free sugars here.

Option E: Natural unsweetened orange juice. The orange has natural sugars, but if it's unsweetened, there's no added sugar. So this doesn't have free sugars.

Option F: Cows' milk. Milk has lactose, which is a natural sugar, but no free sugars since nothing is added.

Option G: Agave nectar. This is a sweetener extracted from the agave plant. It's considered a free sugar as it's added.

Option H: Fruit flavored yogurt. These often have added sugars, even if they use fruit. So free sugars are present.

Option I: Unsweetened iced tea. If it's unsweetened, no added sugars. The tea itself has natural sugars, but no free ones.

So looking for the options without free sugars: E, F, and I. The question asks which do NOT contain free sugars, so the correct answers are E, F, and I. But since the options are from A to I, I need to check which ones the user is asking about. Wait, the question is "which of the following foods do not contain free sugars." So I think the options are A to I, and the correct answers are E, F, and I. But the user gave the options as A through I, so the correct choices are E, F, and I. But the question is a multiple-choice, so perhaps it's looking for all that apply, but in this case, the user's options are each individual letters. So each correct option would be E, F, and I. But wait, the question says "which of the following," implying multiple correct answers. However, the user's initial question seems to present the options as a list, and the answer expects a single letter. Hmm, perhaps I need to re-examine. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check each option again.

Wait, natural unsweetened orange juice (E) doesn't have added sugars, so it's correct. Cows' milk (F) has lactose, which is a natural sugar, not free. Unsweetened iced tea (I) also doesn't have added sugars. So all three (E, F, I) don't have free sugars. But the question is asking which do not contain free sugars, so all three are correct. However, the way the options are presented, each is an option, so perhaps the answer includes all three. But the user's initial setup is to select from A to J, so maybe the correct answer is E, F, and I. But the options given by the user are A through I, and the answer should be the letters that don't have free sugars. So the correct choices are E, F, and I. But since the user is asking for the answer to be a single letter, perhaps the intended answer is E, as it's the first one, but that might not be accurate because F and I also don't have free sugars. Alternatively, maybe I misread the options. Let me check again.

Wait, the user's options are A to I, and the answer is to select all that apply. But in the initial problem, the user says "selecting from the answer A through to J," so perhaps each option is a choice, and the correct ones are E, F, and I. But the way the question is phrased, it's asking which do not contain free sugars, so the correct answers are E, F, and I. However, the way the options are structured, the user might have intended only one correct answer. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again: free sugars are sugars added to foods. So E is natural and unsweetened, so no free sugars. F is milk, which has lactose, a natural sugar, so no free. I is unsweetened tea, no added sugars. So the correct options are E, F, I. But the user's options are A to I, so the answer should include all three. However, the user's setup is to select one letter, so perhaps the intended answer is E, F, and I, but the way the question is presented, it's a multiple-choice with multiple correct answers. But the user's question seems to present the options as a list, so perhaps the correct answer includes E, F, and I. But since the user's initial setup is to select from A to J, maybe the correct answers are E, F, and I. However, looking back at the initial problem, the user provided options A to I, and the answer is to choose the correct ones. So the correct answer should be E, F, and I. But the user's answer expects a single letter, so perhaps the intended correct answer is E, but that's not accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed to have multiple correct answers, but the user expects a single letter. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the options.

Wait, let me think again. Free sugars are any sugars that are added to food. So:

A: White bread – often has added sugar, so yes.

B: Canned fruit in syrup – definitely added.

C: Maple syrup – added.

D: Honey – added.

E: Natural unsweetened OJ – no added sugar, just natural.

F: Milk – natural lactose, no added.

G: Agave – added.

H: Flavored yogurt – added.

I: Unsweetened iced tea – no added.

So the correct answers are E, F, and I. But the user's options are A to I, so perhaps the answer is E, F, I. However, the user's question is a multiple-choice, which usually has one correct answer. Wait, perhaps I'm mistaken, and only E is correct. Let me check: cows' milk has lactose, which is a natural sugar, so it doesn't have free sugars. Unsweetened iced tea also doesn't have free sugars. So the correct options are E, F, and I. But since the user expects a single letter, perhaps the intended answer is E, but that's not correct because F and I also are correct. Alternatively, the question might be designed to have multiple correct answers, but the user expects a single choice. Maybe I need to check if any of these have natural sugars only. So the answer would be E, F, and I.

The foods that do not contain free sugars are E, F, and I. However, since the question expects a single answer, the most appropriate choice is **E**.

Answer: E
