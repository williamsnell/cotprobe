Okay, so I have this economics question about calculating GDP, and I need to figure out which option falls under category C. Let me start by recalling what I know about GDP. GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product, and it measures the total economic output of a country. It includes all the goods and services produced within the country during a specific period. 

I remember that GDP is calculated using the expenditure approach, which sums up Consumption, Investment, Government Spending, and Net Exports. The formula is GDP = C + I + G + (X - M), where C is consumption by households, I is investment (like business spending on capital goods), G is government spending, and X - M is exports minus imports.

The question is asking which of the options would be classified under 'C' when calculating GDP. I think 'C' here refers to Consumption. So I need to identify which option is a form of personal consumption expenditure.

Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: The purchase of a new car by a car rental company. Hmm, a car rental company buying a car. Wait, isn't that investment? Because they're purchasing a capital good to use in their business. So that would fall under 'I', Investment, not 'C'. So A is probably not the answer.

Option B: The purchase of a new construction crane by a construction company. Again, a crane is a capital good used in production. So this is investment, part of 'I'. So B is not C.

Option C: A company buying a new office building. Wait, an office building is a structure, a capital asset. So the company is investing in physical capital. That's 'I' again, not 'C'. So C is not correct.

Option D: A homeowner mowing her own lawn. This is interesting. If someone does work for themselves, like mowing their own lawn, does that count as something in GDP? I think it's considered as part of consumption because it's a service provided by the individual for themselves. Alternatively, it might be under the production of services by the household, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, in GDP, when a household produces a good or service for themselves, it's counted as part of consumption. So D could be a candidate for 'C'.

Option E: Flour purchased by a baker to make donuts. The baker is a business, so buying flour is an intermediate good used in production. This would be part of business investment or part of the cost of goods sold, but in GDP, intermediate goods aren't counted directly. Instead, the value is added at each stage of production. So when the donuts are sold to consumers, that's when it's counted. So E is probably not 'C'.

Option F: The purchase of new computer software by an accounting firm. Software is a capital good, so this is investment ('I'), not consumption. So F is not the answer.

Option G: $50 spent eating out at a restaurant. Eating out is clearly a consumption good. Restaurants are part of the service sector, and when a household spends money on restaurant meals, that's part of personal consumption ('C'). So G is a strong candidate.

Option H: A barber cutting his own hair. Similar to D, if the barber is providing a service to himself, it's like a personal service. So this would also fall under consumption ('C'). So H could be another option.

Wait, but the question is asking which of the options is classified under 'C'. So I need to pick the correct one.

Looking back, the options are A to H, and the answer is one of them. Let me re-examine each.

Option C in the options is a company buying an office building. Wait, no, the options are A to H, and the options are labeled A to H. The question is, which option is under 'C' (Consumption). So I need to find which option is a form of consumption.

So, G is $50 spent at a restaurant, which is a clear consumption by households. H is a barber cutting his own hair, which is also a service provided by the individual for themselves. So both G and H are potentially under 'C'.

Wait, but the question is about which is classified under 'C' when calculating GDP. So both G and H could be correct? But the options are A to H, and the answer is one letter.

Wait, maybe the options are presented as A to J, but the given options are only A to H. Let me check the user's question again.

The options are A through H, and the answer is one of them. So I need to choose between G and H, perhaps.

Wait, actually, let's think again. GDP counts goods and services produced for final consumption. So when a person eats out, that's a final good/service, so G is 'C'. When a barber cuts his own hair, is that considered? I think in GDP, all final consumption by households is counted. So both G and H would be 'C'.

But in the options, only one is correct. Let me check the options again.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question is which option is classified under 'C', so the correct answer is either G or H.

Wait, but the options are A to H, and the choices are presented as A through H. So perhaps looking for which one is a personal consumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is misnumbered, but I think the user made a typo.

Wait, the options are:

A: purchase of a new car by a car rental company (Investment, I)

B: purchase of a new construction crane by a construction company (Investment, I)

C: company buying a new office building (Investment, I)

D: homeowner mowing her own lawn (Consumption, C)

E: flour purchased by a baker (Intermediate good, not counted in GDP directly; value added when sold)

F: purchase of new computer software by an accounting firm (Investment, I)

G: $50 spent eating out (Consumption, C)

H: barber cutting his own hair (Consumption, C)

So the options D, G, and H are all under 'C'. But the question is which one is classified under 'C'.

Wait, but the options are A to H, and the answer is one letter. So perhaps the correct answer is G, as it's a clear example of consumption.

Alternatively, the question is which of the following is classified under 'C', and perhaps more than one is correct, but the options are only one letter.

Wait, but the user provided options A to H, and the question is which one is under 'C'. So perhaps the correct answer is G.

Alternatively, maybe the options are structured so that 'C' is the correct classification for one of them.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each option again.

Option C: A company buying a new office building. That's an investment in capital, so it's 'I'.

Option D: A homeowner mowing her own lawn. That's a service provided by the household, so 'C'.

Option G: Spending on eating out, which is a service, so 'C'.

Option H: Barber cutting own hair, which is a service, so 'C'.

So the question is, which of the options is under 'C'. So the answers could be D, G, H.

But the options are A to H, and the question is asking which would be classified under C. So perhaps the answer is G, because it's a clear example of consumption in the service sector.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D, because it's a personal service. Or H.

Wait, but in GDP, when a person provides a service to themselves, like mowing their lawn or cutting their hair, it's counted as part of consumption. So both D and H are under 'C'.

But the options are A to H, and the question is which one is classified under 'C'. So perhaps the correct answer is G, because it's a straightforward example of consumption.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the options include multiple 'C' possibilities. Let me think again.

The question is, which of the following is classified under 'C' when calculating GDP.

Looking back, the options are:

A: Investment

B: Investment

C: Investment

D: Consumption

E: Intermediate

F: Investment

G: Consumption

H: Consumption

So the possible answers are D, G, H.

But the question is a multiple-choice question, and the options are A to H, so perhaps the correct answer is G, because it's a clear example of a service purchased by a household.

Alternatively, maybe the question is misnumbered, but I think the answer is G.

Wait, but the initial question says "when calculating GDP", so perhaps looking for the correct expenditure category.

I think the correct answer is G: $50 spent eating out at a restaurant, as that's a clear example of personal consumption expenditure.

The question asks which option is classified under 'C' (Consumption) when calculating GDP. Consumption includes goods and services purchased by households. 

- **Option A**: Purchase of a car by a car rental company is investment, not consumption.  
- **Option B**: Purchase of a construction crane is investment.  
- **Option C**: Purchase of an office building is investment.  
- **Option D**: A homeowner mowing their lawn is a personal service, counted as consumption.  
- **Option E**: Flour bought by a baker is an intermediate good, not counted directly in GDP.  
- **Option F**: Purchase of software by an accounting firm is investment.  
- **Option G**: Spending $50 at a restaurant is a clear example of personal consumption.  
- **Option H**: A barber cutting their own hair is also a personal service, counted as consumption.  

While options D, G, and H are all examples of consumption, the most straightforward and widely recognized example is **G**, as eating out is a common and clear form of personal consumption in GDP.  

Answer: G
