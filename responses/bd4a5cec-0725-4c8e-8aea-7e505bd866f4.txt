Okay, so Mr. Stone is taking a loan from his bank to buy a new car. He's borrowing $4,000 for ninety days at a 6 percent discount. The question is, how much will he actually receive? Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I should understand what a discount loan means. I think a discount loan is when the interest is deducted upfront from the loan amount. So instead of paying interest monthly or at the end, the bank takes the interest right away when he takes the money. So the amount he actually gets is the loan amount minus the interest.

Wait, but how do I calculate the interest for a discount loan? I remember that simple interest is calculated using the formula: Interest = Principal × Rate × Time. The principal here is $4,000, the rate is 6%, and the time is 90 days. But wait, usually interest rates are annual, so I need to convert the time into years.

Time is 90 days, which is 90/360 of a year because there are 360 days in a banking year, I think. So 90 divided by 360 is 0.25 years.

So plugging into the formula: Interest = 4000 × 0.06 × 0.25.

Let me calculate that. 4000 times 0.06 is 240. Then 240 times 0.25 is 60. So the interest is $60.

Since it's a discount loan, the interest is subtracted from the principal. So $4,000 minus $60 equals $3,940. That should be the amount he actually receives.

Wait, but let me double-check. Is the time calculation correct? Yes, 90 days is a quarter of a year, so 0.25. 6% of $4,000 is $240 for a year, so for 90 days it's a quarter of that, which is $60. So yes, subtracting $60 from $4,000 gives $3,940.

Looking at the options, J is $3,940. So I think that's the correct answer.

The calculation determines the amount Mr. Stone receives by subtracting the interest from the principal. Using the simple interest formula, the interest is $60, leaving him with $3,940.
