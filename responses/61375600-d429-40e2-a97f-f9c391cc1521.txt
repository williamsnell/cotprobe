Question:

Loretta Landlord owned a commercial building in a commercial strip surrounded by a residential community. One of her largest spaces was rented on a month-to-month basis at $500 per month by a dance troop which held performances in the facility. The director of the dance troop moved to New York for a starring role Off-Broadway. Unfortunately the troop was unable to find another dance director, so it folded and vacated the space. Sally Sleazy learned of the closure and decided the location would be perfect for a topless strip joint. Sally rented the space from Loretta under a two-year lease at $1,000 per month without disclosing her intended use of the space. One month after the strip joint opened, the County Commissioners passed a new law prohibiting topless strip joints in that neighborhood. Sally told Loretta the new law made it impossible to operate the business, so she was leaving. If Loretta then sued Sally for breach of the lease contract, the likely outcome is a judgment for

Options:

A: Loretta, only if she can prove that Sally knew about the upcoming law change.
B: Loretta, if she can prove that Sally intended to breach the contract from the start.
C: Sally, because the change in law was beyond her control.
D: Sally, because the law change is a valid reason for terminating the lease.
E: Sally, because the law made performance of the lease contract impossible.
F: Sally, because the lease contract was discharged under impossibility of performance.
G: Loretta, only if she did not know of the use Sally intended for the space.
H: Loretta, because the new law was passed after the lease was executed.
I: Sally, because the law change made the purpose of the lease void.

Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about contract law, specifically regarding the doctrine of impossibility of performance and whether a lease contract can be terminated due to a new law.

First, I need to understand the facts. Loretta Landlord owns a commercial building that's rented to a dance troop on a month-to-month basis for $500. The troop later vacates the space because their director moved to New York, and they couldn't find another director, so the troop folded. Sally then rents the space from Loretta under a two-year lease at $1,000 per month. She didn't tell Loretta that she intended to use it as a topless strip joint. 

A month after opening, the County Commissioners pass a new law prohibiting topless strip joints in that neighborhood. Sally tells Loretta that this law makes it impossible to operate, so she's leaving. Loretta sues Sally for breach of the lease. The question is, who would likely win?

I remember that in contract law, there's the concept of impossibility of performance, which is a defense to breach. Impossibility occurs when something makes it impossible for one party to fulfill their contractual obligations. But there are conditions for this. For example, if the impossibility arises from a change in law, it might be a valid reason, but it depends on whether the contract was formed before or after the law changed.

Wait, Sally didn't disclose her intended use when she signed the lease. So when she leased the space, she planned to use it as a topless strip joint. The lease was for two years at $1,000 a month. But then a new law was passed that made that use illegal.

I think about the doctrine of impossibility. There's a difference between subjective and objective impossibility. Subjective impossibility is when one party couldn't have foreseen the impossibility, but objective is when it's known or should've been known. Also, if the change in law occurs after the contract is made, sometimes it's considered a supervening impossibility, which might discharge the contract.

Wait, but Sally knew she was opening a topless joint. The law changed after she took the lease, making it impossible. So under the doctrine, if a law is passed that prohibits a party's intended use, does that make performance impossible?

I think the key here is that the law was passed after the lease was signed. So Sally had a valid lease, but then the law made it impossible for her to operate her business as intended. That would be a case of impossibility of performance because the law changed after the contract was made, making her intended use illegal.

But wait, there's also the issue of whether the landlord knew about the intended use. If the landlord had known that the tenant intended to use the space for a topless bar, and the law was passed later, would that affect the outcome? But in this case, Sally didn't disclose her plans. So when she took the lease, she didn't tell Loretta about the intended use. So Loretta might argue that she had no idea what Sally was going to use the space for.

But the law changed after the lease, making the intended use illegal. So Sally would argue that she cannot perform because the law prohibits her use. The question is, does the change in law constitute impossibility of performance?

I think under contract law, a subsequent change in law can sometimes discharge a contract if the performance becomes illegal. This is because the law is a fundamental change in circumstances. So Sally could argue that the lease is now impossible to perform because the new law makes her intended use illegal.

Looking at the options:

Option E says "Sally, because the law made performance of the lease contract impossible." That seems to align with impossibility of performance.

Option F says "Sally, because the lease contract was discharged under impossibility of performance." That's similar to E but phrased differently.

Option C says "Sally, because the change in law was beyond her control." That's more about frustration of purpose, but I'm not sure if that applies here because frustration usually requires that the purpose of the contract is completely destroyed, which might be similar to impossibility.

Wait, let's clarify: Impossibility of performance is a defense when the performance has become impossible due to events outside the control of the parties, like a change in law. Frustration of purpose is when the purpose of the contract is destroyed, but the performance itself is still possible. Here, the performance ( renting the space for a topless bar) is impossible because of the law, so it's more about impossibility rather than frustration.

So which option is correct? E and F both relate to impossibility.

Looking at the options again:

E: Sally, because the change in law made performance impossible.

F: Sally, because the lease contract was discharged under impossibility of performance.

Both seem correct, but perhaps F is more specific, stating that the contract was discharged under the doctrine.

But wait, the options might be structured so that E is correct. Because E directly states that the law made performance impossible, which is the main reason for Sally's defense.

Alternatively, option I says "Sally, because the law change made the purpose of the lease void." That seems more like frustration of purpose, which is a related doctrine but different from impossibility.

So, probably, the correct answer is E or F.

But in the options, E and F are both possibilities. Let me think again.

In contract law, impossibility of performance occurs when, after the contract is formed, an unforeseen event makes performance impossible. If the change in law occurs after the contract, and it's a valid law, then performance could be considered impossible.

So Sally would have a valid defense under impossibility. Therefore, the likely outcome is that Sally wins because the law made performance impossible.

Looking at the options, E and F are both about impossibility. Let me check the wording:

Option E: "because the change in law made performance of the lease contract impossible."

Option F: "because the lease contract was discharged under impossibility of performance."

Both seem correct, but perhaps E is the better choice because it directly states the cause (the law change) leading to impossibility.

Wait, but the issue is whether the impossibility arises from the law change. Also, another point is whether the landlord's knowledge matters. Option A says Loretta wins only if she can prove Sally knew about the law change. But Sally didn't know, I think. The problem states she didn't know and learned of the closure and decided to rent for the strip joint. So she didn't know about the law beforehand.

But the impossibility is not because of the landlord's action but because of the government's new law. So even if the landlord didn't know, the impossibility is due to an external factor.

Thus, the correct answer would be E or F. Since both E and F are about impossibility, I need to see which one is more accurate.

In some jurisdictions, impossibility discharge would require that the impossibility was not the fault of the party seeking discharge. Here, it's a new law, so Sally didn't cause it. Therefore, the contract would be discharged.

So option F says the lease was discharged under impossibility, which would mean Sally doesn't have to perform.

Alternatively, option E says the law made performance impossible, which is the reason for the discharge.

But in the options, only F says it was discharged under impossibility. So perhaps the answer is F.

Wait, but in the options, E and F are both possibilities, but I think F is more accurate as it states the discharge under impossibility.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E. Let me see what the options are.

Looking back:

E: Sally, because the change in law made performance of the lease contract impossible.

F: Sally, because the lease contract was discharged under impossibility of performance.

In my understanding, E is more about the reason (the law change), while F is about the result (discharge under impossibility). Both are correct, but in the context of the question, the outcome would be judgment for Sally because the law made performance impossible. So both E and F are correct in different ways.

But looking at the options, F is more specific to the doctrine. So perhaps F is the better answer.

Wait, but in contract law, if a law is enacted after the contract is formed that makes performance illegal, the contract is typically discharged by impossibility. So Sally can terminate the lease because the law change made it impossible to perform.

Therefore, the correct answer is E or F.

But looking back, the options are:

E: ...because the law made performance impossible.

F: ...because the lease contract was discharged under impossibility of performance.

I think both are correct, but the way the question is phrased, it's asking for the likely outcome. So the court would find that the lease was discharged due to impossibility, so F would be the correct answer.

Wait, but another point: The landlord didn't know about the intended use. Does that affect anything? No, because the impossibility is due to the law, not the landlord's actions.

So the correct answer is F.

The question revolves around contract law, specifically the doctrine of impossibility of performance. Sally entered into a lease agreement with Loretta to rent a space for a topless strip joint. After the lease was signed, a new law was passed prohibiting such establishments, rendering Sally's intended use illegal. 

Under contract law, impossibility of performance occurs when an unforeseen event, such as a change in law, makes performance of the contract impossible. Since the law was passed after the lease was executed, it constitutes a supervening impossibility, which discharges the contract. Sally can argue that the new law made her intended use of the space illegal, making performance impossible. 

Analyzing the options, both E and F address impossibility. Option E focuses on the reason (the law change) causing impossibility, while F emphasizes the discharge of the contract under impossibility. Since the question asks for the likely outcome, F is more precise as it directly states that the lease was discharged under impossibility of performance.

**Answer: F**
