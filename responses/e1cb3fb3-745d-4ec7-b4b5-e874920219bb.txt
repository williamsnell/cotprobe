Question:

A 72-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 7-month history of leg weakness and dry eyes and mouth. He also has had a 10.4-kg (23-lb) weight loss over the past 4 months despite no change in appetite. He has smoked one and a half packs of cigarettes daily for 50 years. He drinks 4 oz of alcohol daily. He has peptic ulcer disease and emphysema. Medications include cimetidine, theophylline, and low-dose prednisone. Examination shows mild ptosis. He has a barrelshaped chest. Breath sounds are distant. There is moderate weakness of proximal muscles of the lower extremities. Reflexes are absent. He has difficulty rising from a chair. Sensory examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray shows a hyperinflated chest and a 3 x 4-cm mass in the right hilum. His neurologic findings are most likely due to a lesion involving which of the following?

Options:

A: Presynaptic neuromuscular junction
B: Spinal cord
C: Muscle membrane
D: Central nervous system
E: Parasympathetic nervous system
F: Motor cortex
G: Postsynaptic neuromuscular junction
H: Peripheral nerve
I: Sympathetic nervous system
J: Sensory nerve

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this medical question. Let me read through the case carefully.

We have a 72-year-old man with several symptoms. He's been experiencing leg weakness for 7 months, dry eyes and mouth, and significant weight loss of 10.4 kg over 4 months. Despite that, his appetite hasn't changed, which is a bit odd. He's a heavy smoker—1.5 packs a day for 50 years—and drinks a little alcohol. He has peptic ulcer disease and emphysema. His medications include cimetidine, theophylline, and low-dose prednisone.

On exam, he has mild ptosis, a barrel-shaped chest (which makes me think of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease like emphysema), distant breath sounds. Proximal muscle weakness in the lower extremities is moderate, and reflexes are absent. He has trouble getting up from a chair. Sensory exam is normal. The x-ray shows hyperinflated lungs and a 3x4 cm mass in the right hilum.

The question is about the neurologic findings being due to a lesion in which part of the nervous system.

First, let's break down the symptoms. The weakness, dry eyes and mouth, weight loss—those could point towards a systemic issue. His smoking history is significant, and given the emphysema, maybe something related to the lungs. The x-ray shows a mass in the right hilum, which is near the lung's root, possibly a tumor.

The key here is the neuromuscular symptoms. Proximal muscle weakness, absent reflexes, and difficulty rising from a chair. Ptosis is drooping of the eyelid, which can be due to various causes, including neurological issues. But in this case, it's mild.

Looking at the options, they're all parts of the nervous system or related structures. Let's go through them:

A: Presynaptic NMJ – This is where the nerve releases acetylcholine into the synaptic space. Issues here might cause problems like myasthenia gravis, but the symptoms here don't exactly fit that. Also, myasthenia is usually more about fluctuating weakness and can affect other muscles more.

B: Spinal cord – If the spinal cord was involved, there might be more issues with coordination, or upper and lower extremity weakness in a different pattern. Plus, he doesn't have sensory issues, so maybe not spinal.

C: Muscle membrane – This would be like muscular dystrophy or something causing muscle weakness directly, but the symptoms here seem more neurological.

D: CNS – Brain or central issues could cause weakness, but without other signs like cognitive issues, maybe less likely.

E: Parasympathetic NS – Dry eyes and mouth could be from parasympathetic issues, but how does that tie into the muscle weakness? Maybe if it's a tumor pressing on parasympathetic pathways, but I'm not sure.

F: Motor cortex – Weakness would be more about upper motor neuron signs, like hyperreflexia, which isn't present here. So probably not.

G: Postsynaptic NMJ – This is where the muscle receives the signal. Issues here could cause muscle weakness. Lambert-Eaton syndrome is a possibility here, which affects the postsynaptic receptors. It's often associated with lung cancers, especially small cell, and can present with muscle weakness, dry mouth, dry eyes, and weight loss.

H: Peripheral nerve – If it's a peripheral neuropathy, you'd expect more distal weakness and sensory issues, which aren't present here. So maybe not.

I: Sympathetic NS – This is more about fight-or-flight responses. Not directly causing the muscle weakness described.

J: Sensory nerve – No sensory issues, so probably not.

Putting it together: The patient's symptoms, especially the muscle weakness, absent reflexes, dry eyes/mouth, and the presence of a lung mass, point towards a paraneoplastic syndrome. Lambert-Eaton syndrome is common with small cell lung cancer and affects the postsynaptic NMJ. It causes muscle weakness, often proximal, and can present with autonomic symptoms like dry mouth and eyes.

So the lesion is likely at the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction.

The patient's symptoms, including proximal muscle weakness, absent reflexes, dry eyes and mouth, and significant weight loss, along with the presence of a right hiliar mass on imaging, suggest a paraneoplastic syndrome. Lambert-Eaton syndrome, often associated with small cell lung cancer, affects the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle weakness and autonomic symptoms. The absence of sensory abnormalities and the pattern of weakness support this diagnosis.
