Alright, so I've got this question about the Address Resolution Protocol, or ARP, in the Internet Protocol suite. I'm a bit rusty on my networking concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that the IP suite includes several protocols like TCP, UDP, HTTP, etc., but ARP is one of the lower-level protocols. From what I recall, ARP is used to map IP addresses to MAC addresses. MAC addresses are those hardware or physical addresses assigned to network interface cards on devices like computers and routers.

The question is asking about the purpose of ARP. Let's look at the options:

Option A says ARP determines the host name from a hardware address. Wait, that doesn't sound right. I thought hostnames are resolved using DNS, not ARP. So A might not be correct.

Option B mentions translating Web addresses to host names. Web addresses are URLs, and I don't think ARP handles that. DNS translates hostnames to IP addresses, so B is probably incorrect.

Option C states it determines the IP address given a hardware address. Hmm, that's the opposite of what I remember. I think ARP is more about finding the MAC address when you have an IP, not the other way around. So C might be wrong.

Option D says it translates hardware addresses to IP addresses. Wait, that's the reverse of what I thought. I thought ARP maps IP to MAC, not the other way. So D might be incorrect.

Option E: Determine the hardware address of a given IP address. Oh, this sounds more familiar. When a device wants to send data to another on the same network, it knows the IP address but needs the MAC address to send the frame. So ARP is used to get the MAC from the IP. So E seems correct.

Option F: Translate hardware addresses to IP. Again, that's the opposite. So F is likely wrong.

Option G: Determine the host name of an IP address. No, that's DNS's job. G is not correct.

Option H: Translate host names to Web addresses. That doesn't make sense. H is probably wrong.

Option I: Determine the IP address of a host name. Again, that's DNS, not ARP. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Determine the hardware address of a host name. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. So you first get the IP from the host name via DNS, then use ARP to get the MAC. So J is not directly what ARP does.

Putting it all together, the correct purpose is for ARP to find the MAC address when given an IP address. So the correct option is E.

The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used to map an IP address to its corresponding MAC address. This allows devices on a network to communicate by translating the IP address, which is used at the network layer, to the MAC address, which is used at the data link layer. Therefore, the correct answer is:

E: To determine the hardware address of a given IP address.

The answer is E.
