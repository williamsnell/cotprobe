Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about social sanctions. The question is about children who suck their thumbs when they enter kindergarten and are teased and ridiculed. The options are various types of sanctions. Let me break this down.

First, I need to understand what social sanctions are. From what I remember, social sanctions are the ways society or groups enforce their norms. They can be positive or negative. Positive sanctions are rewards or approval for conforming to norms, while negative sanctions are punishments or disapproval for not conforming.

Now, the question says the children are being teased and ridiculed. That sounds like a negative reaction, so it's probably a negative sanction. The next thing is whether it's formal or informal. Formal sanctions are usually official actions like laws or regulations, like getting a ticket for speeding. Informal sanctions are more everyday reactions, like being frowned upon or laughed at.

In this case, the teasing and ridicule are happening in kindergarten, which is a social setting. The teachers or other kids are likely doing this informally, not through any official school policy. So it's an informal negative sanction.

Looking at the options, F is "Informal negative sanction." That seems to fit. Other options like A and G are formal, which doesn't fit because it's not an official policy. Options like E and H are positive, which isn't the case here. So the answer should be F.
