Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the surface area of a right rectangular prism. The formula given is S = 2(lw + wh + hl). The prism has a length of 12 inches, a width of 9 inches, and a height of 2 inches. I need to calculate the surface area and choose the correct option from A to J.

First, I should probably recall what a right rectangular prism is. I think it's just a box shape, with all angles being right angles. So, it's like a rectangular box with length, width, and height. The surface area is the total area of all the faces of the prism.

The formula given is S = 2(lw + wh + hl). Let me make sure I understand each term. lw would be the area of the front and back faces, wh for the left and right, and hl for the top and bottom. Each pair of opposite faces has the same area, so we multiply each by 2 and then add them all together, hence the 2 multiplied by the sum.

So, plugging in the values: l = 12, w = 9, h = 2.

Let me compute each term step by step. Maybe I should calculate each product first and then add them up.

First, lw: 12 * 9. That's 108.

Next, wh: 9 * 2. That's 18.

Then, hl: 2 * 12. That's 24.

Now, adding these three together: 108 + 18 + 24. Let me do that. 108 + 18 is 126, and 126 + 24 is 150.

Then, multiply this sum by 2, as per the formula. So 150 * 2 is 300.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 300. But that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, 12 * 9 is indeed 108. 9 * 2 is 18, and 2 * 12 is 24. Adding them: 108 + 18 is 126, plus 24 is 150. Multiply by 2: 300. Hmm, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, the formula is S = 2(lw + wh + hl). Let me check if I added the right terms. lw is length times width, which is the area of the front and back. Then wh is width times height, which is the area of the left and right sides. hl is height times length, which is the area of the top and bottom. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait a second, perhaps I mixed up the terms. Let me think: for a rectangular prism, the surface area is calculated by adding the areas of all six faces. Each pair of opposite faces has the same area. So, the front and back are each l*w, so together 2lw. The left and right are each w*h, so together 2wh. The top and bottom are each h*l, so together 2hl. So the total surface area is 2(lw + wh + hl), which matches the formula given. So my calculations seem correct.

Wait, but 300 is option A, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when I do these problems, I might have missed a step or miscalculated. Let me try calculating each part again.

lw = 12 * 9 = 108
wh = 9 * 2 = 18
hl = 2 * 12 = 24

Adding them: 108 + 18 = 126; 126 +24 = 150.

Multiply by 2: 150 * 2 = 300.

Hmm, that's correct. So the surface area is 300 square inches, which is option A. But wait, looking at the options, option E is 276, which is close to 300 but not exactly. Maybe I should check if I used the correct formula.

Wait, another way to think about it: sometimes people get confused between surface area and volume. Volume would be l * w * h, which is 12*9*2=216, but that's not surface area. So I'm confident I used the right formula.

Alternatively, maybe I can calculate each face's area separately and sum them up.

The prism has 6 faces: front, back, left, right, top, bottom.

Front and back: each is l*w = 12*9=108. So two of them: 108*2=216.

Left and right: each is w*h=9*2=18. Two of them: 18*2=36.

Top and bottom: each is h*l=2*12=24. Two of them:24*2=48.

Now, adding all these together: 216 + 36 = 252; 252 +48=300.

Yep, same result. So the surface area is indeed 300, which is option A.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option A is 300, and that's the first option. Hmm. But I'm a bit concerned because 300 is a big number, but given the dimensions, maybe it's correct.

Let me think again: the length is 12, which is quite long, the width is 9, and the height is 2, which is short. So the front and back are large, each 108, so two of them add up to 216. The sides (left and right) are 18 each, so 36 total. The top and bottom are 24 each, so 48. Adding them up: 216 +36=252, plus 48 is 300. That seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can visualize the box. The largest surfaces are the front and back, each 12x9. The sides are 9x2, which are smaller, and the top and bottom are 12x2, which are also smaller but not as small as the sides.

Wait, but 12x2 is 24 each, so two of them would be 48, which is more than the 36 from the sides. So adding 216 (front/back) + 36 (sides) +48 (top/bottom) gives 300. That makes sense.

So I think the answer is A:300.
</think>

The surface area is calculated using the formula S = 2(lw + wh + hl). Plugging in the given dimensions (l=12, w=9, h=2), we compute each term: lw=108, wh=18, hl=24. Adding these gives 108+18+24=150, and multiplying by 2 yields 300. This confirms the surface area is 300 square inches.
