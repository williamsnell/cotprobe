Okay, so I have this question here about converting Fahrenheit to Celsius. The question is asking what temperature on the Centigrade scale corresponds to 68°F, which is a common room temperature. The options are from A to J, with various numbers. Alright, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius, there's a formula. I think it's something like (F - 32) multiplied by 5/9. Let me write that down to make sure I get it right. So the formula should be: °C = (°F - 32) × (5/9). Yeah, that sounds right. I've used this formula before, so I'm pretty confident.

Now, the given temperature is 68°F. Let me plug that into the formula. So subtracting 32 from 68 first. 68 minus 32 is 36. That part seems straightforward. Then, I need to multiply that result by 5/9. So 36 multiplied by 5/9. Hmm, let me calculate that. 

Wait, 36 divided by 9 is 4, right? Because 9 times 4 is 36. So then 4 multiplied by 5 is 20. So 36 times 5/9 equals 20. So that means 68°F is equal to 20°C. 

Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So 68 minus 32 is indeed 36. Then 36 times 5 is 180, and 180 divided by 9 is 20. Yep, that's correct. So 68°F converts to 20°C.

Looking at the options provided: A is 21°C, B is 16°C, C is 22°C, D is 25°C, E is 24°C, F is 20°C, G is 23°C, H is 19°C, I is 26°C, and J is 18°C. So the correct answer should be option F, which is 20°C.

Wait, but I should also think about whether 20°C is indeed considered room temperature. I know that room temperature is usually around 68°F, which I've heard is roughly 20°C. So that makes sense. Sometimes people might round it to 20 or 22, but the exact calculation here gives 20. So I think F is the correct choice.

The correct conversion of 68°F to Celsius is 20°C.
