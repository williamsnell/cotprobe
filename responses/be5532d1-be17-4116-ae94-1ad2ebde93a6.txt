Okay, so I have to find the steady-state solution of a difference equation. The equation given is y[n] + (1/√3)y[n-1] = cos(π/6 n). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my discrete-time signal processing, but let me try to work through this step by step.

First, I remember that the steady-state solution for a linear difference equation with a sinusoidal input can be found by assuming a solution of the same sinusoidal form. So, I think I should suppose that the steady-state solution y_ss[n] is of the form A cos(ωn + φ), where A is the amplitude and φ is the phase shift. Alternatively, sometimes it's easier to write it as a phasor in exponential form, but maybe I'll stick with cosine for now.

The equation is y[n] + (1/√3)y[n-1] = cos(π/6 n). So, this is a first-order linear difference equation. The general approach for such equations is to find the homogeneous solution and then a particular solution. But since we're interested in the steady-state, which is the particular solution when the transient (homogeneous) part has decayed, I can focus on finding the particular solution directly.

Wait, but for discrete-time systems, the method is similar to continuous-time, using the z-transform or assuming a sinusoidal solution. Let me think about the approach.

I'll substitute y[n] = A cos(ωn + φ) into the difference equation and see what happens. But wait, y[n-1] would be A cos(ω(n-1) + φ) = A cos(ωn - ω + φ). So, the equation becomes:

A cos(ωn + φ) + (1/√3) A cos(ωn - ω + φ) = cos(ωn), since the input is cos(ωn) where ω is π/6.

Let me factor this. Using the trigonometric identity cos(a) + cos(b) = 2 cos[(a+b)/2] cos[(a-b)/2], but wait, in this case, I have coefficients. Maybe it's better to use Euler's formula to express cosines as exponentials, sum them, and then equate the coefficients.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this using phasors. Since the input is a cosine, the particular solution will also be a cosine with the same frequency. So, let me write y[n] = K cos(ωn + φ), where K is the amplitude and φ is the phase shift to be determined.

Substituting into the equation:

K cos(ωn + φ) + (1/√3) K cos(ω(n-1) + φ) = cos(ωn).

Let me simplify the left side. The second term can be written as (1/√3) K cos(ωn - ω + φ). Using the cosine addition formula, cos(ωn - ω + φ) = cos(ωn + (φ - ω)).

So now, the equation becomes:

K cos(ωn + φ) + (K / √3) cos(ωn + (φ - ω)) = cos(ωn).

Let me factor out cos(ωn) and use the identity for cos(A) + cos(B). So, let me write it as:

K [1 + (1/√3) cos(-ω)] cos(ωn + φ') = cos(ωn), where φ' is some phase.

Wait, maybe another approach would be better. Let me use the sum-to-product formula. Alternatively, perhaps I can express both terms as complex exponentials and combine them.

Let me represent each cosine as the real part of a complex exponential. So, cos(θ) = Re{e^{iθ}}. Then:

Left side becomes Re{ K e^{i(ωn + φ)} + (K/√3) e^{i(ωn - ω + φ)} }.

Factoring out e^{iωn}, we get:

Re{ e^{iωn} [ K e^{iφ} + (K/√3) e^{-iω} e^{iφ} ] }.

Which simplifies to Re{ e^{iωn} K e^{iφ} [1 + (1/√3) e^{-iω}] }.

Then, the left side is K Re{ e^{iωn} e^{iφ} [1 + (1/√3) e^{-iω}] }.

Which equals K Re{ e^{i(ωn + φ)} [1 + (1/√3) e^{-iω}] }.

The right side is Re{ e^{iωn} }, since cos(ωn) is the real part of e^{iωn}.

So, setting the two sides equal, we get:

K [1 + (1/√3) e^{-iω}] e^{iφ} = 1.

Wait, because the real parts must be equal for all n, so the coefficients must match, implying that the entire expression inside the Re{} must match when multiplied by e^{iωn}.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the system's frequency response. The transfer function H(z) for the system y[n] + (1/√3)y[n-1] = x[n] can be written as Y(z)/X(z) = 1 / (1 + (1/√3) z^{-1}).

Because the equation is y[n] + (1/√3)y[n-1] = x[n], so rearranged, it's x[n] = y[n] + (1/√3) y[n-1], so the transfer function H(z) is Y(z) / X(z) = 1 / (1 + (1/√3) z^{-1} ).

So, H(z) = 1 / (1 + (1/√3) z^{-1} ). To find the steady-state response, we evaluate H at z = e^{iω}, where ω is the frequency of the input.

So, substituting z = e^{iω}, H(e^{iω}) = 1 / (1 + (1/√3) e^{-iω} ).

Then, the amplitude of the steady-state solution is |H(e^{iω})|, and the phase is the argument of H(e^{iω}).

So, let's compute H(e^{iω}):

H(e^{iω}) = 1 / [1 + (1/√3) e^{-iω} ]

Let me compute the denominator: 1 + (1/√3) e^{-iω} = 1 + (1/√3)(cos ω - i sin ω).

Let me represent this as a complex number: let me write it as A + i B, where A = 1 + (1/√3) cos ω, and B = -(1/√3) sin ω.

So, the denominator is A + i B. Therefore, H(e^{iω}) = 1/(A + i B) = (A - i B)/(A² + B²).

The magnitude squared is A² + B², so |H(e^{iω})| = 1 / sqrt(A² + B²).

Let me compute A² and B²:

A = 1 + (1/√3) cos ω

B = -(1/√3) sin ω

A² = [1 + (1/√3) cos ω]^2 = 1 + (2/√3) cos ω + (1/3) cos² ω

B² = [ (1/√3) sin ω ]^2 = (1/3) sin² ω

So, A² + B² = 1 + (2/√3) cos ω + (1/3)(cos² ω + sin² ω )

Since cos² + sin² =1, this becomes 1 + (2/√3) cos ω + (1/3)(1) = 1 + (2/√3) cos ω + 1/3 = (4/3) + (2/√3) cos ω.

Wait, let me compute that:

1 + 1/3 = 4/3. So, A² + B² = 4/3 + (2/√3) cos ω.

Hmm, but wait, that's not correct. Let me double-check:

Wait, (1/3) cos² ω + (1/3) sin² ω = (1/3)(cos² ω + sin^2 ω) ) = 1/3.

So, A² + B² = 1 + (2/√3) cos ω + 1/3.

Which is 1 + 1/3 = 4/3, so 4/3 + (2/√3) cos ω. Oh, so that's correct.

So, |H(e^{iω})| = 1 / sqrt(4/3 + (2/√3) cos ω).

Wait, but can I simplify this denominator?

Let me factor out 2/√3 from the denominator:

sqrt(4/3 + (2/√3) cos ω) = sqrt( (2/√3)(2/√3) + (2/√3) cos ω )

Wait, 4/3 is (2)^2/(√3)^2? Let me check: (2/√3)^2 = 4/3, yes.

So, 4/3 + (2/√3) cos ω = (2/√3)^2 + (2/√3) cos ω.

So, factor out (2/√3):

= (2/√3) [ (2/√3) + cos ω ]

Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, 4/3 is (2/√3)^2, and (2/√3) cos ω is as is.

So, the expression under the square root is (2/√3)^2 + (2/√3) cos ω.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to factor 2/√3:

= (2/√3) [ (2/√3) + cos ω ] ?

Wait, no, because (2/√3)^2 is 4/3, and (2/√3) cos ω is 2 cos ω / √3.

Wait, perhaps I can write the denominator as (2/√3) (something). Let me think:

Wait, 4/3 + (2/√3) cos ω = (2/√3)(2/2 * √3/√3) + ... Hmm, maybe not the best approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express this as (a cos ω + b)^2. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the magnitude numerically for the given ω.

In the problem, the input is cos(π/6 n), so ω = π/6.

So, let me substitute ω = π/6 into A² + B².

Compute cos(π/6) = √3/2, sin(π/6)=1/2.

So,

A = 1 + (1/√3)(√3/2) = 1 + (1/√3)(√3/2) = 1 + (1/2) = 3/2.

B = -(1/√3)(1/2) = -1/(2√3).

So, A² = (3/2)^2 = 9/4.

B² = [1/(2√3)]^2 = 1/(4*3) = 1/12.

A² + B² = 9/4 + 1/12 = (27/12 + 1/12) = 28/12 = 7/3.

So, |H(e^{iπ/6})| = 1 / sqrt(7/3) ) = sqrt(3/7).

That's the magnitude of the steady-state solution. So, the amplitude A is sqrt(3/7).

Now, the phase φ of the steady-state solution is the argument of H(e^{iω}).

H(e^{iω}) = 1/(A + i B) = (A - i B)/(A² + B²).

So, the phase is - arctan(B/A), because the denominator is A + i B, so the angle is arctan(B/A), but since B is negative, the angle is in the fourth quadrant, so the phase shift is - arctan(B/A).

Alternatively, the argument of H(e^{iω}) is the negative of the argument of (A + i B), which is arctan(B/A). Since B is negative, the angle is in the fourth quadrant, so the argument is - arctan(|B|/A).

So, let's compute arctan(|B|/A) with A=3/2 and |B|=1/(2√3).

So, |B|/A = (1/(2√3)) / (3/2) )= (1/(2√3)) * (2/3) )= 1/(3√3).

So, the phase shift φ is - arctan(1/(3√3)).

Wait, but the input is cos(ωn), and the output is A cos(ωn + φ). So, the phase shift is φ = - arctan(1/(3√3)).

Alternatively, since the argument of H is negative, the phase of the output is φ = - arctan(1/(3√3)).

So, putting it all together, the steady-state solution is:

y_ss[n] = sqrt(3/7) cos(π/6 n - arctan(1/(3√3)) ).

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check. The options have various forms, including sine and cosine with different arguments.

Wait, let me see:

Option A: sqrt(3/7) cos[ (π/6)n tan^{-1}(1/(2√3)) ]

Option C: sqrt(2/7) cos[ (π/6 n) tan^{-1}(1/(3√3)) ]

Option E: sqrt(3/7) sin[ (π/6 n) tan^{-1}(1/(3√3)) ]

Option G: sqrt(3/7) cos[ (π/6 n) tan^{-1}(1/(3√3)) ]

Wait, option G is sqrt(3/7) cos[ (π/6 n) + tan^{-1}(1/(3√3)) ]

Wait, no, actually, looking at the options, I think I might have misread the phase term.

Wait, let me check again. The phase shift I found is - arctan(1/(3√3)), so the argument inside the cosine would be (π/6 n) - arctan(...). But in the options, I see some with plus and some with minus.

Looking at option I: sqrt(3/7) cos[ (π/6)n + tan^{-1}(1/(3√3)) ]

Option G: sqrt(3/7) cos[ (π/6 n) tan^{-1}(1/(3√3)) ] – wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the options have the phase added, but I have a negative phase shift.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the phase calculation. Let me re-examine.

Wait, when I computed H(e^{iω}), I got H(e^{iω}) = (A - i B) / (A² + B²), where A = 3/2 and B = -1/(2√3).

So, H(e^{iω}) = (3/2 - i (-1/(2√3)) ) / (7/3) )? Wait, wait, no. Wait, A² + B² is 7/3, so H(e^{iω}) = (A - i B) / (7/3) ) = (3/2 - i (-1/(2√3))) * (3/7) )= [3/2 + i/(2√3)] * (3/7).

Wait, no, actually, H(e^{iω}) is 1/(A + i B) = (A - i B)/(A² + B²) = (3/2 + i/(2√3)) / (7/3).

So, H(e^{iω}) has a real part of (3/2) * (3/7) = 9/(14) and an imaginary part of (1/(2√3)) * (3/7) )= 3/(14√3).

So, the phase angle φ is arctan(Imaginary part / Real part) = arctan( [3/(14√3)] / [9/(14)] ) )= arctan( [3/(14√3)] * [14/9] )= arctan( (3)/(9√3) )= arctan(1/(3√3)).

So, the phase angle is positive, which means the output is cos(ωn + φ), where φ is arctan(1/(3√3)).

Wait, but earlier I thought the phase was negative. Hmm, perhaps I confused the sign earlier.

Wait, let me double-check. Since the denominator in H(e^{iω}) is A + i B, with B negative. So, when I compute 1/(A + i B) = (A - i B)/(A² + B²), the imaginary part becomes positive because B is negative. So, the phase is positive. Thus, the output is cos(ωn + φ), where φ = arctan( (1/(2√3)) / (3/2) ) )= arctan(1/(3√3)).

So, the steady-state solution is y_ss[n] = sqrt(3/7) cos( (π/6) n + arctan(1/(3√3)) ).

Looking back at the options, I see option I: sqrt(3/7) cos[ (π/6) n + tan^{-1}(1/(3√3)) ]

And option G: sqrt(3/7) cos[ (π/6) n tan^{-1}(1/(3√3)) ] – wait, that doesn't look right; the argument is (π/6 n) multiplied by tan^{-1}, which would be a phase shift dependent on n, which doesn't make sense. So, probably option I is the correct one.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option I: y_ss[n] = sqrt(3/7) cos[ (π/6) n + tan^{-1}(1/(3√3)) ]

Option C: sqrt(2/7) cos[ ... ]

Option G: sqrt(3/7) cos[ (π/6) n tan^{-1}(1/(3√3)) ]

Wait, the correct form is cos(ωn + φ), so option I has the plus sign, and the phase is arctan(1/(3√3)), which matches.

Wait, but why is the option I written as (π/6) n + tan^{-1}(1/(3√3))? That seems correct.

So, the amplitude is sqrt(3/7), and the phase is positive arctan(1/(3√3)), so the correct option would be option I.

Wait, but looking at option I, the expression is cos( (π/6) n + tan^{-1}(1/(3√3)) ). So yes, that matches.

Wait, but let me check the other options again. Option G is written as cos( (π/6) n tan^{-1}(1/(3√3)) ), which would be cos( [ (π/6) * tan^{-1}(1/(3√3)) ] n ), which is a fixed phase shift multiplied by n, which is incorrect. The correct form is to have the phase added inside the cosine function.

So, the correct answer should be option I: sqrt(3/7) cos[ (π/6) n + tan^{-1}(1/(3√3)) ]

Wait, but looking at the options again, option G is same as I but without the plus sign inside the cos? No, option G has the argument as (π/6 n) multiplied by tan^{-1}, which is incorrect.

So, yes, the correct option is I.

Wait, but let me check if the phase is added or if I missed a negative somewhere.

Wait, the phase of H(e^{iω}) is positive arctan(1/(3√3)), so the output is y[n] = |H| cos(ωn + φ). Therefore, the phase is positive, so the correct form is cos(ωn + φ). So option I is correct.

The steady-state solution of the given difference equation is determined by finding the amplitude and phase shift of the particular solution. Assuming a solution of the form \( y_{ss}[n] = A \cos(\omega n + \phi) \), where \( \omega = \pi/6 \), and substituting it into the equation leads to determining the amplitude \( A \) and phase \( \phi \). Using the transfer function \( H(z) = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} z^{-1}} \) and evaluating it at \( z = e^{i\omega} \), the magnitude \( |H(e^{i\omega})| \) is found to be \( \sqrt{\frac{3}{7}} \), and the phase \( \phi \) is \( \arctan\left(\frac{1}{3\sqrt{3}}\right) \). Thus, the steady-state solution is \( y_{ss}[n] = \sqrt{\frac{3}{7}} \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{6} n + \arctan\left(\frac{1}{3\sqrt{3}}\right)\right) \), which matches option I.
