Question:

A plane wall of an oven consists of an inside layer of refractory brick 6 in. thick (k = 0.08 Btu/hr-ft-°F) followed by a 9 in. layer of common brick (k = 0.8 Btu/hr-ft-°F). If the temperature of the inner wall sur-face is 1800°F and that of the outer surface is 200°F, determine the rate of heat loss per unit area, through this wall.

A: 300 Btu/hr-ft^2
B: 400 Btu/hr-ft^2
C: 180 Btu/hr-ft^2
D: 150 Btu/hr-ft^2
E: 350 Btu/hr-ft^2
F: 100 Btu/hr-ft^2
G: 275 Btu/hr-ft^2
H: 200 Btu/hr-ft^2
I: 222.61 Btu/hr-ft^2
J: 250 Btu/hr-ft^2

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this heat transfer problem about a plane wall. Hmm, let me think. The wall has two layers: refractory brick and common brick. They're both in series, right? So the heat has to pass through both layers.

The given data is: the inside layer is 6 inches thick with a thermal conductivity (k) of 0.08 Btu/hr-ft-°F. The outside layer is 9 inches thick with k=0.8. The temperatures on the inner surface are 1800°F and the outer surface is 200°F.

Wait, so the temperature difference is from 1800 to 200. Let me calculate that first. 1800 minus 200 is 1600°F. But wait, no, actually, the formula uses the difference across the entire wall, so that's correct.

Since the wall is a composite of two layers in series, the total thermal resistance is the sum of each layer's resistance. Thermal resistance R is calculated as (thickness)/(k), but wait, thickness needs to be in feet because the units for k are per foot. So 6 inches is 0.5 feet, and 9 inches is 0.75 feet.

So R1 for refractory brick is 0.5 ft / 0.08 Btu/(hr-ft-°F). Let me compute that: 0.5 divided by 0.08 is 6.25. So R1 is 6.25 (°F·hr)/(Btu).

R2 is 0.75 / 0.8. Let's see, 0.75 divided by 0.8. Hmm, 0.75 is 3/4, and 0.8 is 4/5, so 3/4 divided by 4/5 is (3/4)*(5/4) = 15/16, which is 0.9375. So R2 is 0.9375 (°F·hr)/(Btu).

Total R is R1 + R2 = 6.25 + 0.9375 = 7.1875.

Now, the formula for heat transfer per unit area (Q/A) is temperature difference divided by total resistance. So Q/A = ΔT / R_total.

ΔT is 1600°F. So Q/A is 1600 / 7.1875. Let me calculate that.

Let me see, 7.1875 * 222 is about 1600, because 7 * 222 is 1554, and 0.1875 * 222 is about 41.25, so total around 1595.25. So approximately 222.61.

Wait, looking at the options, option I is 222.61. So that's the answer. But wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check.

Alternatively, 1600 / 7.1875. Let me compute it step by step. 7.1875 multiplied by 200 is 1437.5, which is less than 1600. So 200 gives 1437.5. The difference is 1600 - 1437.5 = 162.5.

Now, how much more do I need? 7.1875 * x = 162.5. So x = 162.5 / 7.1875. Let's calculate that. 7.1875 * 22 is 158.125, and 7.1875 * 22.6 is about 7.1875*(22 +0.6)=158.125 +4.3125=162.4375. Close to 162.5. So x is approximately 22.6.

So total Q/A is 200 +22.6 = 222.6, which matches option I.

The rate of heat loss is calculated by summing the thermal resistances of the two layers and then applying the formula Q/A = ΔT / R_total. After calculations, the result is approximately 222.61 Btu/hr-ft², which corresponds to option I.
