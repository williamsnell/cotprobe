Okay, I'm trying to figure out this psychology question about instrumental responses and punishment. Let's break it down step by step.

The question is asking what happens when a moderate punishment is applied to an instrumental response of moderate strength. I remember that instrumental conditioning, or operant conditioning, deals with how the consequences of behavior affect future behavior. So, the key here is understanding how punishment affects the strength of a response.

First, let's recall what instrumental responses are. These are behaviors that operate on the environment to produce consequences. The strength of the response probably refers to how likely the behavior is to occur. Moderate strength means it's not very strong but also not very weak; it's somewhere in the middle.

Now, the question is about moderate punishment. Punishment, in operant conditioning, is an aversive stimulus that follows a behavior, which decreases the likelihood of that behavior happening again. But the type of punishment matters. There's positive punishment, where an aversive stimulus is added, and negative punishment, where a pleasant stimulus is removed. But I'm not sure if the type matters here; the question just says moderate punishment, so maybe it's about the intensity rather than the type.

When a punishment is applied, it generally weakens the response. If the punishment is too severe, it might eliminate the response immediately. But if it's moderate, maybe it just suppresses the response temporarily. I think I remember something about partial reinforcement schedules leading to more persistent behavior, but that's about reinforcement, not punishment.

Wait, in the context of punishment, a moderate response might be temporarily suppressed because the punishment makes the individual avoid the behavior for a while. But over time, if the punishment isn't too harsh, the behavior might come back because the memory of the punishment fades. So the response would be suppressed initially but might strengthen over time as the effect of punishment wears off. That sounds like option A: temporarily suppressed but strengthen over time.

Let me think about other options. Option B says it's eliminated. That would happen with a very strong punishment, not moderate. Option C says it's strengthened, which doesn't make sense because punishment should decrease the response. Option D is remain unchanged, but punishment usually affects the response. Option E is increase in frequency, which is more about reinforcement, not punishment. Option F is become erratic, maybe if the punishment is inconsistent, but the question says moderate, so probably not. Option G is suppressed, which is more about immediate effects, but the question says moderate punishment and moderate strength response. Option H is become more precise, which doesn't fit. Option I is become uncontrolled, that seems unrelated. Option J is replaced by a stronger response, which might happen if the punishment leads to a new behavior, but I'm not sure.

So, putting it together, moderate punishment would probably suppress the response temporarily, but over time, the suppression might wear off, making the response strengthen again. So the answer should be A.

When a moderate punishment is applied to an instrumental response of moderate strength, it typically leads to the response being temporarily suppressed. However, over time, the effect of the punishment may diminish, causing the response to strengthen again. This aligns with the understanding that punishment generally reduces the likelihood of a behavior, but if it's not severe enough, the behavior may reemerge as the aversive effects subside.

Answer: A
