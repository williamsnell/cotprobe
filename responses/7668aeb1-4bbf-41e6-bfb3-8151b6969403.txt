Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about research purposes, and I need to figure out which option isn't a research purpose. Let's see, the options are A through J: argumentation, exploration, description, justification, comprehension, interpretation, persuasion, prediction, triangulation, and explanation.

First, I should remember what research purposes are. From what I recall, research generally aims to explore, describe, explain, predict, justify, or interpret phenomena. Sometimes it's also about comprehending or understanding better. But I'm not sure about all of them.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Argumentation. Hmm, argumentation is more about presenting reasons or evidence to support a point of view. In research, while it's important to argue a point, is argumentation a primary purpose? I'm not sure. I think argumentation might be more of a method or a component within research rather than the purpose itself.

Option B: Exploration. Yes, exploration is definitely a research purpose. Exploratory research aims to uncover new information or discover patterns without specific hypotheses.

Option C: Description. That's a fundamental purpose. Descriptive research aims to provide a clear picture of a phenomenon as it exists.

Option D: Justification. Justification involves proving the validity or reasonableness of something. In research, especially in fields like policy or theory, justification is important. So it's a research purpose.

Option E: Comprehension. This seems similar to understanding, which is definitely a goal of research. To comprehend something thoroughly is part of the research process.

Option F: Interpretation. Yes, interpretive research seeks to understand the meaning behind data, so that's a purpose.

Option G: Persuasion. Persuasion is about convincing others of a viewpoint. While research can be persuasive, I think persuasion is more of a communication strategy rather than the research purpose itself. The purpose is more about seeking knowledge rather than convincing.

Option H: Prediction. Predictive research aims to forecast future events or trends based on data, so that's a valid purpose.

Option I: Triangulation. Wait, triangulation is a method used in research to cross-validate data by using multiple sources or methods. It's a strategy, not a purpose. So this might be the odd one out.

Option J: Explanation. Explanation is a primary purpose of research, aiming to clarify cause-effect relationships or how things work.

So, considering all this, the options that aren't purposes are A (argumentation) and G (persuasion) and I (triangulation). But wait, the question asks for which is NOT a research purpose.

Wait, I thought argumentation and persuasion are more about communication rather than the research itself. Also, triangulation is a method, not a purpose.

Wait, the question is about 'research purpose.' So, purposes are why the research is conducted. Methods are how it's conducted.

So, looking again:

A: Argumentation - purpose? Maybe not, more like a method or aspect within communication.

G: Persuasion - same as above.

I: Triangulation - definitely a method, not a purpose.

So, the question is which is NOT a research purpose. So, the options that are not purposes are A, G, I.

But the options given are A to J, and the question is which is not a purpose. So, the correct answer would be the one that's not a purpose.

Wait, the options are:

A: argumentation

B: exploration

C: description

D: justification

E: comprehension

F: interpretation

G: persuasion

H: prediction

I: triangulation

J: explanation

So, among these, I think A, G, and I are not purposes. But the options given are only one correct answer.

Wait, let me think again.

Exploration, description, justification, comprehension, interpretation, prediction, explanation: these are all research purposes.

Argumentation: I'm not sure. Maybe in some contexts, like argumentative research, but I think it's more about the communication aspect.

Persuasion: Again, more about convincing others, not the research purpose.

Triangulation: Method, not purpose.

So, the question is, which is NOT a research purpose.

If I have to choose one, the options are A, G, I.

But looking back, the options include "triangulation" (I), which I'm pretty sure is a method, not a purpose.

So, the answer should be I: triangulation.

The question asks which option is not a 'research purpose.' Research purposes typically involve exploring, describing, explaining, predicting, justifying, or interpreting phenomena, among others. 

- **A: Argumentation** - This is more about presenting evidence to support a point, not a primary research purpose.  
- **B: Exploration** - A valid research purpose.  
- **C: Description** - A fundamental research purpose.  
- **D: Justification** - A research purpose in fields like policy or theory.  
- **E: Comprehension** - A goal of research to understand thoroughly.  
- **F: Interpretation** - A research purpose to understand meanings behind data.  
- **G: Persuasion** - More about convincing others, not a research purpose.  
- **H: Prediction** - A valid research purpose.  
- **I: Triangulation** - A method, not a purpose.  
- **J: Explanation** - A primary research purpose.  

Among these, **A (argumentation)**, **G (persuasion)**, and **I (triangulation)** are not research purposes. However, since the question asks for one answer, **I (triangulation)** is the best choice as it is clearly a method, not a purpose.

Answer: I
