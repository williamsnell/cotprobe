Okay, so I need to figure out the correct translation of the sentence "Either Taylor or Eric is a latte boy" into predicate logic. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I should understand what the sentence is saying. It's stating that at least one of Taylor or Eric is a latte boy. "Either...or" usually indicates an inclusive OR, meaning one or both could be true.

Now, looking at predicate logic, the general form for "Either A or B" is A ∨ B. But I need to represent this correctly with predicates.

The predicate here is "is a latte boy." Let's denote "Lx" as the predicate where x is a variable representing a person. So, if Taylor is a latte boy, it would be Lt, and similarly, Le for Eric.

The sentence says either Taylor is a latte boy or Eric is. So in predicate logic, that would be Lt ∨ Le. That seems straightforward.

Looking at the options, option A is Lt ∨ Le, which matches exactly what I'm thinking. But let me check the other options to be sure.

Option B is Lx ∨ Ly. That uses variables x and y, but the original sentence refers to specific people, Taylor and Eric. So B doesn't seem right because it's too generic.

Option C is Lt ∧ Le, which means both are latte boys. But the sentence says either one, not necessarily both. So C is incorrect.

Option D is L(t ∧ e), which might mean that t and e together are a latte boy, but that doesn't make sense because t and e are individuals, and L is a predicate for a single person. So D is wrong.

Option E is tL ⊃ eL, which translates to if Taylor is a latte boy, then Eric is. That's a different meaning; it's a conditional, not an OR. So E is not correct.

Option F is tL ∨ eL. Wait, this looks similar to option A but written differently. Lt and tL are the same, just the order is swapped. So F is Lt ∨ Le, which is the same as A. Hmm, but I should check if the notation is standard. Typically, predicates are written with the variable after, like Lt meaning L(t), so Lt ∨ Le is correct, and F is written as tL, which might be less standard. So I think A is more likely the correct form.

Option G is Lx ∧ Ly, which again is an AND, so it's incorrect because the sentence uses OR.

Option H is L(t ∨ e). This would mean that t ∨ e (as a single entity) is a latte boy, which doesn't make sense because t and e are separate individuals. So H is wrong.

Option I is E ∨ T, which just combines the names as propositions without predicates. This doesn't specify that they are latte boys, so I is incorrect.

Option J is Tl ⊃ El, which is another conditional, meaning if Taylor is a latte boy, then Eric is. Again, not an OR, so J is wrong.

So after reviewing all options, the correct translation should be Lt ∨ Le, which is option A. Option F is the same but uses a different notation order, which might be less standard, so I'll stick with A.

The correct translation is Lt ∨ Le, which corresponds to option A.
