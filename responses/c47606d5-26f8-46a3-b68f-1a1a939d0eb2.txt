Question:

You notice a lesion on the labial alveolar mucosa of the lower right lateral incisor tooth of one of your patients and decide to take a biopsy to send for oral pathology report Which nerve would require local anaesthesia in order to carry out a pain-free biopsy?

Options:

A: The mental nerve
B: The hypoglossal nerve
C: The incisive nerve
D: The buccal nerve
E: The inferior alveolar nerve
F: The infraorbital nerve
G: The facial nerve
H: The maxillary nerve
I: The lingual nerve
J: The trigeminal nerve

Answer:

Okay, so I've got this question about which nerve to anaesthetize for a biopsy on the labial alveolar mucosa of the lower right lateral incisor. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that when taking a biopsy in the mouth, you have to consider the nerves that supply that area to ensure proper numbing. The question is asking about local anesthesia, so I'm thinking about the major nerves involved in the lower jaw area.

The lesion is on the labial alveolar mucosa of the lower right lateral incisor. Labial alveolar mucosa is the mucous membrane covering the alveolar process of the jaw, which holds the teeth. The lateral incisor is the second tooth from the right on the lower arch, so it's in the anterior part of the mandible.

I think about the innervation of the lower jaw. The main nerve responsible for the lower teeth and surrounding mucosa is the inferior alveolar nerve. This nerve comes from the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V), specifically the mandibular division. It enters the mandible through the mental foramen and supplies the lower teeth and the adjacent mucosa, including the labial areas.

Other options: Let's see, the mental nerve is a branch of the inferior alveolar nerve, so if you block the main trunk (inferior alveolar), you might not need the mental. The hypoglossal nerve is more for tongue movement, so probably not relevant here. The incisive nerve, wait, isn't that part of the maxillary division? Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, the maxillary nerve (V2) is for the upper jaw, so that's not it. The buccal nerve is a sensory nerve for the cheek, so maybe not the one for the alveolar area.

The facial nerve is for facial muscles and some taste, but not the main sensory for the alveolar mucosa. The lingual nerve is for the tongue, so if the lesion is on the labial side, it's more about the alveolar nerve. The trigeminal nerve itself is the main, but you don't inject that directly; you block a branch.

So putting it together, the inferior alveolar nerve supplies the lower alveolar mucosa, so to make the biopsy pain-free, you'd need to anesthetize that. So the answer should be E: The inferior alveolar nerve.

The inferior alveolar nerve is responsible for innervating the lower alveolar mucosa, including the area around the labial alveolar mucosa of the lower right lateral incisor. To ensure a pain-free biopsy, local anesthesia of this nerve is necessary.

Answer: E
