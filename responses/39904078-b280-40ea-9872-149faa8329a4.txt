Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I need to find the standard enthalpy of solution for AgCl(s) dissolving in water. Hmm, I remember that the standard enthalpy of solution is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a substance dissolves in water under standard conditions. 

The question says to use the enthalpies of formation of the solid and the aqueous ions. Right, so I think I need to use the formation enthalpies (ΔHf°) of the solid AgCl, the Ag⁺ ion, and the Cl⁻ ion. 

Wait, the formula for the enthalpy of solution would involve the dissolution reaction. So, the dissolution of AgCl(s) into Ag⁺(aq) and Cl⁻(aq). The reaction is: 
AgCl(s) → Ag⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq)

The enthalpy change for this reaction would be the sum of the enthalpies of formation of the products minus the reactants. But wait, AgCl(s) is a solid, so its ΔHf is given as a value, and the ions have their own ΔHf values.

Let me think about the formula. The standard enthalpy of solution (ΔHsoln°) is calculated as:
ΔHsoln° = [ΔHf°(Ag⁺(aq)) + ΔHf°(Cl⁻(aq))] - ΔHf°(AgCl(s))

So I need the ΔHf° values for Ag⁺(aq), Cl⁻(aq), and AgCl(s). Oh, I remember that the ΔHf° of pure solids and liquids is zero, but wait, no—actually, the standard enthalpy of formation for elements in their standard state is zero. But AgCl(s) is a compound, so it has a ΔHf°.

Wait, but what are the values? I think I remember that the ΔHf° for AgCl(s) is around -127 kJ/mol, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to recall. Alternatively, maybe I should look up the standard enthalpies of formation. Wait, I'm just trying to think through this. 

As for the ions, Ag⁺(aq) and Cl⁻(aq), their ΔHf° values are known. I think Ag⁺(aq) has a ΔHf° of about +105.15 kJ/mol. Cl⁻(aq) is around -167.2 kJ/mol. Wait, or is it the other way around? Maybe I'm mixing up some numbers. Let me see. Another approach: perhaps I can think of the dissolution process and the lattice energy, but wait, no, the problem says to use the formation enthalpies.

Wait, actually, the dissolution of AgCl involves breaking the ionic lattice into ions, which requires energy, and then the ions dissolving in water, which releases energy. But since the problem gives me the formation enthalpies, I can use that instead of lattice energy.

So going back to the formula:

ΔHsoln° = [ΔHf°(Ag⁺) + ΔHf°(Cl⁻)] - ΔHf°(AgCl)

I think the standard enthalpies of formation for the ions are as follows:
Ag⁺(aq) has a ΔHf° of +105.15 kJ/mol.
Cl⁻(aq) has a ΔHf° of -167.2 kJ/mol.
AgCl(s) has a ΔHf° of -127.1 kJ/mol.

Wait, I'm not entirely confident about these numbers. Let's plug them in and see.

So, [105.15 + (-167.2)] - (-127.1) = ?

Calculating the products first: 105.15 - 167.2 = -62.05.

Then subtracting the ΔHf of AgCl: -62.05 - (-127.1) = -62.05 + 127.1 = 65.05 kJ/mol.

Wait, but the options don't have 65.05. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option A is -65.49 kJ/mol, G is +65.49, and so on. Wait, I got 65.05, which is close to 65. So G is +65.49, which is option G. But wait, why is the sign positive?

Wait, because the dissolution process is endothermic if the enthalpy is positive. So if I have a positive value, that would mean the solution is endothermic.

Wait, but let me double-check the signs.

ΔHsoln = [sum products] - [reactants]

Products are Ag⁺(aq) and Cl⁻(aq), sum their ΔHf°. Reactants is AgCl(s), which has ΔHf° of -127.1.

So:

Sum of products: 105.15 (Ag⁺) + (-167.2) (Cl⁻) = -62.05.

Reactants: -127.1.

So ΔHsoln = (-62.05) - (-127.1) = 65.05 kJ/mol.

Which is positive, so the solution is endothermic. Looking at the options, G is +65.49, which is close to 65.05. Hmm, but I thought the correct answer might be option F or G.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the dissolution of AgCl is considered exothermic. Wait, but according to the calculation, it's positive. Let me make sure I got the signs right.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of formation for AgCl(s) is negative because it's more stable than the elements. So for the dissolution reaction:

AgCl(s) → Ag⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq)

The ΔHf° of AgCl is -127.1. The products' sum is (105.15 -167.2) = -62.05. So the change is -62.05 - (-127.1) = 65.05 kJ/mol. So positive, endothermic.

Looking back at the options, option G is +65.49. Close enough, considering rounding. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps I mixed up the ions' enthalpy of formation. Let me check again. For example, maybe Cl⁻(aq) is +167.2? No, no, because Cl⁻ is more stable than Cl₂(g), but wait, the formation of Cl⁻ from Cl₂ and electrons would involve exothermic steps, so its ΔHf should be negative.

Wait, let me think again: the formation reaction for Cl⁻ is:

1/2 Cl₂(g) + e⁻ → Cl⁻(aq); ΔHf° = ?

I think the standard enthalpy of formation for Cl⁻(aq) is about -167.2 kJ/mol. So that's correct.

Wait, another approach: the dissolution of AgCl is typically considered to be endothermic. Because the lattice energy is high, so breaking the crystal lattice requires energy. But when the ions dissolve, they release energy due to hydration. If the overall process is endothermic, the ΔHsoln is positive, which aligns with the calculation.

So the answer should be option G: +65.49 kJ/mol.

To calculate the standard enthalpy of solution of $\mathrm{AgCl}(\mathrm{s})$ in water, we use the enthalpies of formation of the solid and the aqueous ions. The dissolution reaction is:

$$\mathrm{AgCl(s)} \rightarrow \mathrm{Ag^+(aq)} + \mathrm{Cl^-(aq)}$$

The standard enthalpy of solution ($\Delta H_{\text{soln}}^\circ$) is given by:

$$\Delta H_{\text{soln}}^\circ = \left[\Delta H_f^\circ(\mathrm{Ag^+(aq)}) + \Delta H_f^\circ(\mathrm{Cl^-(aq)})\right] - \Delta H_f^\circ(\mathrm{AgCl(s)})$$

Using the standard enthalpies of formation:
- $\Delta H_f^\circ(\mathrm{Ag^+(aq)}) = +105.15 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}$
- $\Delta H_f^\circ(\mathrm{Cl^-(aq)}) = -167.2 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}$
- $\Delta H_f^\circ(\mathrm{AgCl(s)}) = -127.1 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}$

Substituting these values:

$$\Delta H_{\text{soln}}^\circ = \left[105.15 + (-167.2)\right] - (-127.1)$$

First, calculate the sum of the products:

$$105.15 - 167.2 = -62.05$$

Then, subtract the enthalpy of the reactants:

$$-62.05 - (-127.1) = -62.05 + 127.1 = 65.05 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}$$

This value is positive, indicating an endothermic process. Among the options, the closest value is **+65.49 kJ/mol**, which corresponds to option G.

Answer: G
