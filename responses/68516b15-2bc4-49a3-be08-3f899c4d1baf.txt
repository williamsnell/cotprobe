Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Now, we have organized a society, and we call it "Share Our Wealth Society," a society with the motto "Every Man a King."…
We propose to limit the wealth of big men in the country. There is an average of $15,000 in wealth to every family in America. That is right here today.
We do not propose to divide it up equally. We do not propose a division of wealth, but we do propose to limit poverty that we will allow to be inflicted on any man's family. We will not say we are going to try to guarantee any equality … but we do say that one third of the average is low enough for any one family to hold, that there should be a guarantee of a family wealth of around $5,000; enough for a home, an automobile, a radio, and the ordinary conveniences, and the opportunity to educate their children.…
We will have to limit fortunes. Our present plan is that we will allow no man to own more than $50,000,000. We think that with that limit we will be able to carry out the balance of the program.

Okay, so I have this question about Senator Huey P. Long's "Share Our Wealth Society" from 1934. The question is asking why his society attracted many followers that year. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the 1930s were a time of significant economic hardship in the U.S., especially during the Great Depression. People were really struggling, so any movement that promised relief or change might have been appealing.

Looking at the passage, Senator Long talks about limiting the wealth of the big men, proposing that no one should own more than $50 million. He also mentions ensuring that every family has at least $5,000, which is enough for a home, car, radio, and education. So the society's main ideas were capping the wealthy and providing a minimum standard of living.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Proposes limiting fortunes to $50M. That's accurate, but is that the main reason it attracted followers? Maybe, but perhaps it's more about the broader promise.

B: Growing dissatisfaction with capitalism. The Depression did cause people to question the system, so this could be a factor.

C: Idea of every man being a king. The motto is "Every Man a King," which sounds appealing, but does that alone explain the attraction?

D: Promised to limit the wealth of the rich and provide a minimum standard. This seems to directly address the main points of Long's proposal—both limiting the wealthy and ensuring everyone has enough. This seems like a strong contender.

E: Rise of technology demanding wealth distribution. I don't think technology was a big driver in 1934; the focus was more on economic relief.

F: New Deal hadn't ended the Depression. The New Deal was in place, but it wasn't enough, so people might look for alternatives. This could explain the appeal, but the question is about why Share Our Wealth specifically attracted followers.

G: WWII's influence on egalitarianism. WWII was after 1934, so this probably doesn't apply.

H: Surge in immigrant population. There's no mention of immigration being a big issue then, and I don't think it's related.

I: Flourishing economy and baby boom. Actually, the economy was struggling, so this doesn't make sense.

J: Socialistic ideas becoming popular. Long's society does have socialist elements, so this could be a reason, but was it the main attraction?

So, considering all options, D seems to capture the essence of what Long proposed—limiting the rich and ensuring a basic standard of living for all. This would directly address the economic struggles of the time, making it attractive to many people who were suffering. Option B is also relevant because dissatisfaction with capitalism was high, but the specific promises in D are more directly tied to the society's appeal.

Another thought: Option J mentions socialist ideas being popular. Long's plan does have socialist aspects, but the primary reason people followed might have been the concrete proposals to relieve their own hardships rather than a broader ideological shift.

So, putting it all together, the best answer seems to be D.
