Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about calculating the difference between two tipping methods on a $60 bill before tax. Hmm, I think I need to find out how much each method amounts to and then see the difference between them.

First, the standard tip is 15% of the bill before tax. The bill is $60, so I'll calculate 15% of 60. Let me do that: 15% of 60 is 0.15 * 60. Hmm, 0.15 times 60, that's 9 dollars, right? So that's $9.00.

Now, the other method is that many people in California double the sales tax to calculate the tip. The sales tax is 8.25%, so I need to find 8.25% of the bill and then double it. Let me calculate 8.25% of $60 first. 

8.25% as a decimal is 0.0825. So, 0.0825 multiplied by 60. Let me work that out. 60 times 0.08 is 4.8, and 60 times 0.0025 is 0.15. Adding those together, 4.8 + 0.15 equals $4.95. So the sales tax is $4.95. 

But wait, the tip is double that sales tax. So I need to multiply $4.95 by 2. Let's see, 4.95 * 2 is $9.90. So that's $9.90 as the tip using the sales tax method.

Now, I need to find out how much more this second method is compared to the standard tip. The standard tip is $9.00, and the other is $9.90. The difference is 9.90 minus 9.00, which is $0.90. 

But the question asks by how many cents this exceeds the standard tip. Since $0.90 is 90 cents, the answer should be 90 cents. Looking at the options, option B is 90. So, the answer should be B: 90.

The standard tip is 15% of $60, which is $9. The sales tax is 8.25% of $60, which is $4.95, doubled to $9.90. The difference is $0.90, or 90 cents.

Answer: B
