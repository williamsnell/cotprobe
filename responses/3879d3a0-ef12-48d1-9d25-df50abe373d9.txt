Okay, so I've got this question about where different accounting items belong on a balance sheet. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think it through carefully. Let me list out each part and try to figure it out one by one.

The question lists five items: (A) Taxes payable, (B) Capital stock, (C) Retained earnings, (D) Administrative expense, and (E) Prepaid expenses. I need to match each of these to the correct section of the balance sheet from the options given.

First, I should recall the structure of a balance sheet. It typically has three main sections: Assets, Liabilities, and Owner's Equity. Sometimes it's remembered with the acronym A-L-E. 

Let's go through each item:

1. **Taxes payable (A):** This is money the company owes to the government, like income tax or sales tax. Since it's an amount the company hasn't paid yet, it's a liability. So it should go in the Liabilities section.

2. **Capital stock (B):** This refers to the shares issued by the company. It's part of the shareholders' equity, which is included in Owner's Equity on the balance sheet. So, this should be in the Owner's Equity section.

3. **Retained earnings (C):** Retained earnings are the profits that have been reinvested in the company rather than paid out as dividends. This is also part of Owner's Equity. So again, Owner's Equity section.

4. **Administrative expense (D):** Expenses are costs incurred in running the business. Administrative expenses are part of the income statement, not the balance sheet. They affect the company's profit but aren't listed as assets, liabilities, or equity on the balance sheet.

5. **Prepaid expenses (E):** These are expenses that the company has paid for but haven't used yet. Since they represent future economic benefits, they're considered assets. So, this should be on the Asset side.

Now, let me go through the options provided to see which one matches these assignments.

Option A: 
(A) Liability, (B) Asset, (C) Owner's Equity, (D) Asset, (E) Owner's Equity. 
Wait, (B) is Capital stock, which is Owner's Equity, so this option is wrong because it lists (B) as Asset.

Option B:
(A) Owner's Equity, which is wrong because Taxes payable is a liability. So B is out.

Option C:
(A) Asset, which is wrong. So no.

Option D:
(A) Owner's Equity, wrong again. So D is incorrect.

Option E:
(A) Income Statement, correct because Taxes payable is a liability, so E's first is wrong.

Option F:
(A) Owner's Equity, wrong. So F is out.

Option G:
(A) Liability, correct. (B) Liability, but Capital stock is Owner's Equity, so G is wrong.

Option H:
(A) Income Statement, correct. (B) Owner's Equity, correct. (C) Income Statement, correct. (D) Liability, but Administrative expense is Income Statement, so H is wrong.

Option I:
(A) Asset, wrong. So I is out.

Option J:
(A) Liability, correct. (B) Owner's Equity, correct. (C) Owner's Equity, correct. (D) Income Statement, correct. (E) Asset, correct. So J seems to match all correctly.

Wait, let me double-check each point with J:

- (A) Taxes payable: Liability – correct.
- (B) Capital stock: Owner's Equity – correct.
- (C) Retained earnings: Owner's Equity – correct.
- (D) Administrative expense: Income Statement – correct.
- (E) Prepaid expenses: Asset – correct.

Yes, that's all correct. So the answer should be option J.
