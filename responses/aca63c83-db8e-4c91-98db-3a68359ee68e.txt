Question:

Using a marginal utility approach, explain why air, so vitally important to the maintenance of life, is free.

Options:

A: Air is free because it regenerates itself too quickly to be priced.
B: Air is free because it can't be packaged and sold
C: Air is free because it's abundant
D: Air is free because its marginal utility remains constant, regardless of consumption.
E: Air is free because its marginal utility is zero, it is not a scarce good.
F: Air is free because the cost of production is zero.
G: Air is free because no one owns it
H: Air is free because the technology to control its distribution does not exist.
I: Air is free because it is impossible to measure its utility.
J: Air is free because it is a fundamental human right.

Okay, so I have this economics question about why air is free using the marginal utility approach. Hmm, I remember that marginal utility is the additional satisfaction or benefit a consumer gets from consuming one more unit of a good. 

The question is asking why air, which is so crucial for life, is free. So I need to think about the concept of marginal utility in this context.

Air is obviously essential, but it's free. Let me go through the options. 

Option A says air regenerates too quickly to be priced. That's more about the production rate than marginal utility. It's a possibility, but maybe not the best fit.

Option B suggests it can't be packaged and sold. That's true, but again, it's about the practicality of selling, not the marginal utility concept directly.

Option C is about abundance. Well, if something is abundant, its marginal utility might be low, but I'm not sure if that's the main reason it's free. Because other abundant things might still have some cost.

Option D says marginal utility remains constant. Wait, if the utility doesn't change with consumption, that might mean it's not subject to the law of diminishing marginal utility. But I'm not sure how that ties to being free.

Option E states that air's marginal utility is zero because it's not scarce. Oh, that makes sense. If something isn't scarce, the marginal utility might not drive the price up. Because if a good is abundant and not scarce, its marginal utility is low, and prices might be zero. 

Option F says the cost of production is zero. That's true, but the question is about marginal utility, not production costs directly. Production cost being zero could make it free, but the reasoning here should focus on utility.

Option G says no one owns it. That's a factor, but again, it's more about ownership and property rights than utility.

Option H is about the technology to control distribution not existing. That's a real-world issue, but in economic terms, it's not directly about marginal utility.

Option I suggests it's impossible to measure utility. Well, measuring utility is a theoretical problem, but in reality, we do assign values. So I'm not sure this is the right answer.

Option J is about it being a fundamental right. That's more of a philosophical or legal argument, not an economic one using marginal utility.

So, focusing back on marginal utility. The key idea is that if a good is not scarce, its marginal utility doesn't create demand in the same way. Air is abundant, so the marginal utility per unit is very low, approaching zero. Because the marginal utility is zero, the price can be zero. So the correct answer should be E: Air is free because its marginal utility is zero, it is not a scarce good.

The question asks why air, despite being essential, is free using the marginal utility approach. Marginal utility refers to the additional satisfaction from consuming one more unit of a good. Air is abundant and not scarce, which means its marginal utility is very low and effectively zero. This is because, with an abundance of air, consuming more of it does not provide additional benefit, and thus, it does not have an economic value. Therefore, the correct answer is:

E: Air is free because its marginal utility is zero, it is not a scarce good.

Answer: E
