Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Read the following memoir.
Not only did he expect all persons of distinction to be in continual attendance at Court, but he was quick to notice the absence of those of inferior degree; at his lever, his couches, his meals, in the gardens of Versailles (the only place where the courtiers in general were allowed to follow him), he used to cast his eyes to right and left; nothing escaped him[;] he saw everybody. If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: "I do not know him"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, "He is a man I never see"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.
No one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.
He loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence.
â€”Duke Saint-Simon, Memoirs of Louis XIV and His Court and His Regency, c. 1750

Answer:

Okay, so I need to figure out which option best explains the bias in the provided document. The document is a memoir by the Duke of Saint-Simon about King Louis XIV and his court. 

First, I should read the passage carefully to understand the content and the tone. The passage describes Louis XIV as someone who expected constant attendance from courtiers and was meticulous about noting who was present. He was very formal and kept track of who was at court, even going so far as to question their absence. When it came to granting favors, he was selective and made it clear when he didn't know someone or rarely saw them. The passage also mentions that Louis XIV loved splendor and encouraged similar tastes, which made him favor those who spent money extravagantly. The author explains that Louis XIV's policies included making expensive habits fashionable, forcing courtiers to live beyond their means and become dependent on his generosity.

Now, the question is about the bias in this document. The options are all about the Duke's perspective and his feelings towards Louis XIV's policies and actions.

Looking at the options:

A: The Duke is biased in favor of the king because of policies to increase central state power. The passage doesn't directly talk about central state power but more about court life and dependence.

B: The Duke is indifferent. But the passage seems critical of Louis's policies, so indifferent might not fit.

C: The Duke supports Louis's policies to keep nobles in debt and dependent. The passage describes how Louis's policies made courtiers spend more than they could and become dependent on him. It seems the Duke is critical here, not supportive, because he's detailing how Louis controlled the nobility.

D: The Duke is impartial. But since the passage shows Louis's manipulative policies, it's more likely the Duke has a negative view, so D might not be correct.

E: The Duke is sympathetic to Louis. The passage shows Louis's control and manipulation, which might not indicate sympathy.

F: The Duke disapproves of Louis's extravagance. The passage does mention Louis's love for splendor and how he used it to control others, but the Duke's own stance isn't clear. It could be more about the effect rather than disapproving of the lifestyle itself.

G: The Duke supported administrative control. The passage doesn't focus on that, so probably not.

H: The Duke supported Louis's preservation of aristocracy's position but removal of power. This seems possible because Louis kept them in a position of social honor but made them dependent, which could be seen as removing their political power.

I: The Duke is biased against Louis due to suppression of nobility. The passage describes how Louis controlled the nobility, making them dependent, which could be seen as suppression, so the Duke might be biased against this.

Now, considering the Duke's position as a noble, he might have been critical of Louis's policies that weakened their power. The passage seems to highlight Louis's control mechanisms, which could be seen as suppression. Therefore, option I suggests the Duke is biased against Louis because of this suppression.

Alternatively, option C suggests the Duke supports Louis's policies to keep nobles in debt. But the Duke seems to be describing the situation as negative, so he might not support it but rather be critical.

Wait, the Duke is writing about Louis's policies that made the nobles spend more, leading them to depend on him. If the Duke is a noble, he might disapprove of this because it reduces the nobles' independence. So the bias would be against Louis's policies that suppressed their social position or autonomy.

Therefore, the best explanation is that the Duke is biased against Louis because of his suppression of the nobility, making option I the correct answer.

The document describes Louis XIV's policies that made courtiers dependent on his generosity, reducing their independence. The Duke, as a noble, likely disapproves of this suppression of his class's autonomy. 

Answer: I
