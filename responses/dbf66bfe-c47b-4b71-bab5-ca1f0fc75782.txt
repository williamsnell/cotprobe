<think>
Okay, so I have this physics problem about light reflection, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

White light is normally incident on a puddle of water with an index of refraction of 1.33. On top of this water is a thin layer of oil, 500 nm thick, with an index of refraction of 1.5. The question is asking which wavelength is most strongly reflected. The options are from A to J, with various wavelengths.

Hmm, I remember that when light hits a thin film, like this oil layer, interference occurs. The interference can be either constructive or destructive, depending on the conditions. Since the question is about the most strongly reflected wavelength, I think it's about constructive interference.

Wait, but wait. The setup has three media: air, oil, and water. So the light first travels through air (n=1), then hits the oil (n=1.5), and then water (n=1.33). So the light is going from air (n=1) to oil (n=1.5) to water (n=1.33). 

I recall that when light moves from a medium of lower refractive index to a higher one, there's a phase shift of π (half a wavelength) upon reflection. Conversely, when moving from higher to lower, there's no phase shift. So, let's think about each reflection.

First, the light hits the top surface of the oil (from air). Air has n=1, oil is n=1.5, which is higher. So reflection here will cause a phase shift of π.

Then, the light goes through the oil and hits the water (n=1.33). Oil has a higher n than water (1.5 > 1.33), so when reflecting here, the light is going from higher to lower. So reflection at this interface (oil-water) doesn't cause a phase shift.

Wait, but wait. Because the oil is on top of water, the light that goes through the oil and reflects off the water will have potentially different phase shifts compared to the light that reflects off the top of the oil.

But wait, the problem is about the reflected light from the top surface. The two reflected rays we need to consider are:

1. The ray that reflects off the top of the oil (air-oil interface).
2. The ray that goes through the oil, reflects off the water, and then comes back out through the oil (oil-water interface).

These two rays will interfere. For constructive interference, the path difference plus any phase shifts must result in a path difference that is an integer multiple of the wavelength in the medium.

Wait, the path difference for the second ray is twice the thickness of the oil because it goes down and back up. So that's 2*d, where d is 500 nm. But since the oil has a refractive index, the wavelength in the oil is different from in air.

So the wavelength in the oil is λ/n_oil. Let me think: the wavelength λ0 in vacuum is related to the wavelength in a medium by λ = λ0 / n. So in oil, the wavelength is λ0/1.5.

Wait, but the light we're considering is the incident white light, which has various wavelengths. So the wavelength inside the oil is λ/n, where λ is the wavelength in vacuum (or in air, since air's refractive index is approximately 1). So for each wavelength λ, the wavelength in oil is λ/1.5.

The path difference for the second ray is 2*d, which is 2 * 500 nm = 1000 nm. But this path is traveled in the oil, so in terms of wavelengths in oil, the number of wavelengths is 1000 nm / (λ/1.5) ) = (1000 * 1.5) / λ = 1500 / λ.

Wait, but that's the number of wavelengths in oil. So the phase difference is (2π) * (1500/λ) ) radians.

But we also have to consider the phase shifts from reflections. The first reflection (air-oil) causes a phase shift of π. The second reflection (oil-water) doesn't cause a phase shift because it's going from higher to lower index. So when the second ray comes back, it's reflected without a phase shift. So the total phase shift between the two rays is π (from the first reflection) minus 0 (from the second), so a net phase shift of π.

Wait, but wait. The first ray (reflected at air-oil) undergoes a phase shift of π. The second ray (reflected at oil-water) doesn't. So when they interfere, the second ray's phase is the same as if it had no shift, while the first has a shift of π.

So the total phase difference between them is the phase shift from the path plus any phase shifts from reflection. Let me clarify: the first reflection (ray 1) has a phase shift of π. The second reflection (ray 2) goes down, reflects with no phase shift, and comes back up. So when both rays are in the air again, ray 2 has a phase shift of 0 (since it reflected off oil-water), while ray 1 has a phase shift of π.

But the path difference also introduces a phase shift. The path difference is 2d, which in terms of wavelength in the medium is 2d/(λ/n) ) = 2d n / λ.

So the total phase difference is (2π * (2d n / λ )) ) + (phase shifts).

Wait, no. The phase shift due to path is (2π) * (2d n / λ), because the path is 2d, and each wavelength contributes 2π phase.

Additionally, the reflections cause a phase shift. Ray 1 has a phase shift of π, and ray 2 has none. So the net phase shift between the two rays is (2π*(2d n)/λ) ) + (π - 0). Because ray 1 is shifted by π, and ray 2 is not. So the total phase difference is (4π d n)/λ + π.

Wait, but wait. The condition for constructive interference is that the total phase difference is an odd multiple of π. Because when the phase difference is (2m+1)π, the two waves are out of phase by half a wavelength, leading to destructive interference. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Wait, constructive interference occurs when the phase difference is 2π m, where m is integer. Destructive interference occurs when the phase difference is (2m +1)π.

Wait no, wait. Let me correct that. The condition for constructive interference is that the total phase difference is an integer multiple of 2π. Because that means the waves are in phase, so they add up. For destructive, the phase difference is an odd multiple of π, which is (2m+1)π, meaning the waves are out of phase by half a wavelength, leading to cancellation.

So in this case, we need the total phase difference between the two rays to be 2π m for constructive interference.

So total phase difference is (4π d n)/λ + π = 2π m.

We can factor out π: [ (4 d n)/λ + 1 ] π = 2π m.

Divide both sides by π: (4 d n)/λ + 1 = 2 m.

Rearranged: 4 d n / λ = 2 m - 1.

So λ = (4 d n)/(2m - 1).

Now, d is 500 nm, n is 1.5.

So λ = (4 * 500 nm * 1.5) / (2m -1 )

Calculate numerator: 4 * 500 = 2000; 2000 *1.5 = 3000 nm.

So λ = 3000 nm / (2m -1).

We need to find which of the options corresponds to λ when m is an integer that gives a wavelength within the visible spectrum.

Let's compute for m=1: denominator is 1, so λ=3000 nm. That's 3000 nm, which is 3 microns, way beyond visible light (which is about 400-700 nm). So m=1 is too big.

Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider whether the phase shifts are correctly accounted for.

Wait, let me think again. The first reflection (air-oil) causes a phase shift of π. The second reflection (oil-water) doesn't. So when the two rays come together, the first ray has a phase shift of π, and the second has none. So the net phase difference due to reflection is π. Then, the path difference introduces a phase shift of (2π) * (2d n / λ). So the total phase difference is (4π d n / λ ) + π.

We want constructive interference, so total phase difference should be 2π m, where m is integer.

So (4π d n / λ ) + π = 2π m.

Divide both sides by π: (4 d n / λ ) + 1 = 2 m.

Rearranged: 4 d n / λ = 2m -1.

So λ = (4 d n) / (2m -1).

Again, d=500 nm, n=1.5.

So λ = (4 * 500 *1.5) / (2m-1) = (3000) / (2m-1).

Now, let's plug in m=1: λ=3000/1=3000 nm → 3 microns, which is infrared. Not visible.

m=2: 3000/3=1000 nm → 1 micron, still IR.

m=3: 3000/5=600 nm. 600 nm is in the visible spectrum (orange-red).

m=4: 3000/7 ≈428.57 nm, which is blue.

m=5: 3000/9≈333 nm, UV, not visible.

So the possible visible wavelengths are at m=3 (600 nm) and m=4 (≈428.57 nm). Let's check the options.

Looking at the options, option G is 600 nm, option C is 450 nm (close to 428.57 but a bit higher), and option D is 650 nm, which is not exactly 600.

Wait, but 600 nm is option G. So that's a possible candidate.

Wait, but let's double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the condition for constructive interference when there's a phase shift of π (from reflection) is that the path difference should be an odd multiple of half wavelengths. Because the phase shift is π, which is equivalent to a half wavelength path difference. So the total path difference plus the phase shift should account for the condition.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the formula for thin films with two phase shifts. Wait, but in this case, only one reflection causes a phase shift.

Wait, sometimes, when you have thin film interference, the condition is based on whether the number of phase inversions is even or odd.

In this case, there's one phase inversion (at the first reflection). So the condition for constructive interference would be that the path difference is (2m +1) λ/2, where λ is the wavelength in the medium.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. The general formula for thin film interference when there's a phase shift upon reflection is that the condition for constructive interference is 2nt cosθ = (m + 1/2) λ, where θ is the angle of incidence (which is 0 here, so cosθ=1), nt is the thickness times the refractive index, and m is an integer.

Wait, but wait. Let's clarify. The formula for constructive interference in a thin film with a phase shift upon reflection is:

2 n t = (m + 1/2) λ

Because the phase shift is π (equivalent to a half wavelength), so the condition becomes that the path difference plus the phase shift leads to constructive interference. So 2nt = (m + 1/2) λ.

In this case, the light is moving from air (n=1) into oil (n=1.5), so the first reflection (air-oil) causes a phase shift of π. The second reflection (oil-water) doesn't. So the total phase shift is π. Therefore, the condition for constructive interference is that the path difference plus the phase shift leads to a total that is 2π m.

The path difference is 2nt (since the light goes down and up, so 2t in the medium). The phase shift from reflection is π. So the total phase difference is (2π * 2nt / λ ) + π.

We want this to be equal to 2π m.

So:

(4 π nt / λ) + π = 2 π m.

Divide both sides by π:

4 nt / λ + 1 = 2 m.

Rearranged:

4 nt / λ = 2m -1.

So λ = (4 nt) / (2m -1).

With n=1.5, t=500 nm.

So λ = (4 * 1.5 * 500) / (2m-1) = (3000) / (2m-1) nm.

So same as before. So for m=3, λ=3000/(5)=600 nm.

Which is option G.

But wait, let's check if the wavelength in the medium is correctly considered.

Wait, the formula λ = (4 nt)/(2m-1) gives the wavelength in the medium? Or is it in vacuum?

Wait, no. Wait, the formula is derived using the wavelength in the medium, because the path difference is in the medium. So when we say 2nt, t is in the medium, and the wavelength used is the wavelength in the medium.

Wait, but when considering the incident light, which is in air, the wavelength in air is λ0. The wavelength in the oil is λ = λ0 / n. So the condition would be 2nt = (m + 1/2) λ0, because the path difference is 2nt, and the wavelength in the medium is λ0 / n.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it using the condition for constructive interference when there's a phase shift upon reflection at one surface.

The condition is:

2 n t = (m + 1/2) λ,

where λ is the wavelength in the medium.

Wait, but λ in the medium is λ0 / n, where λ0 is the wavelength in vacuum (or air, since n≈1). So substituting, we get:

2 n t = (m + 1/2) (λ0 / n).

Multiply both sides by n:

2 n^2 t = (m + 1/2) λ0.

But λ0 is the wavelength in air, which is what we're dealing with for the incident light. Wait, this is getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the condition for constructive interference when one reflection causes a phase shift of π and the other doesn't.

In this case, the condition is that the path difference (2nt) plus the phase shift (π) should result in a total phase difference that's an integer multiple of 2π.

So, the path difference in terms of wavelengths is (2nt)/λ, where λ is the wavelength in the medium. Each wavelength corresponds to 2π phase. So the phase shift from the path is (2π * 2nt)/λ.

Adding the phase shift from reflection (π), the total phase difference is (4 π nt)/λ + π.

Set this equal to 2π m:

(4 π nt)/λ + π = 2 π m.

Divide both sides by π:

(4 nt)/λ + 1 = 2 m.

So,

4 nt = (2m -1) λ.

Which rearranges to:

λ = (4 nt)/(2m -1).

So again, same as before.

So for n=1.5, t=500 nm,

λ = (4 *1.5 *500 ) / (2m-1) = 3000/(2m-1) nm.

So for m=1, λ=3000 nm → IR.

m=2: λ=1000 nm → IR.

m=3: 600 nm → visible (orange-red).

m=4: 3000/7 ≈428.57 nm → blue.

m=5: 333 nm → UV.

So the possible visible wavelengths are at m=3 (600 nm) and m=4 (≈428.57 nm).

Looking at the options, 600 nm is option G, and 450 nm is option C. Wait, but our calculation for m=4 gives about 428.57 nm, which is close to 400 nm (option H) but not exactly 450. So perhaps the closest option is 600 nm, option G.

Wait, but let's check the options again. The options are:

A: 750 nm

B: 350 nm

C: 450 nm

D: 650 nm

E: 550 nm

F: 500 nm

G: 600 nm

H: 400 nm

I: 700 nm

J: 800 nm

So 600 nm is option G, and 428.57 is close to 400 (H), but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the phase shifts.

Wait, another approach: when light reflects off a medium with higher refractive index, it undergoes a phase shift of π. So at the air-oil interface (n=1 → n=1.5), reflection causes a phase shift of π. At the oil-water interface (n=1.5 → n=1.33), reflection doesn't cause a phase shift because n decreases.

So, the two reflected rays are:

1. Ray 1: Reflects at air-oil, phase shift of π.

2. Ray 2: Transmits through air-oil, reflects at oil-water (no phase shift), then transmits back into air.

The path difference is 2t (down and up through oil). In terms of wavelength in oil, that's 2t * n / λ0, where λ0 is the wavelength in air.

So the condition for constructive interference is that the path difference plus any phase shifts equals an integer multiple of λ0 / 2. Or wait, perhaps the condition is that the path difference plus the phase shifts leads to a total that's an integer multiple of λ0.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me recall the general formula.

When there's a phase shift upon reflection at one surface, the condition for constructive interference is 2nt = (m + 1/2) λ, where λ is the wavelength in air.

So, 2nt = (m + 1/2) λ.

So, λ = (2nt) / (m + 1/2).

Here, n=1.5, t=500 nm.

So,

λ = (2 * 1.5 * 500) / (m + 0.5) = (1500) / (m + 0.5) nm.

Now, let's compute for m=0: λ=1500/(0.5)=3000 nm → IR.

m=1: 1500/(1.5)=1000 nm → IR.

m=2: 1500/(2.5)=600 nm → visible (option G).

m=3: 1500/(3.5)= ~428.57 nm → blue.

m=4: 1500/4.5≈333.33 nm → UV.

So same as before. So for m=2, λ=600 nm, which is option G.

So the most strongly reflected wavelength is 600 nm, option G.
</think>

To determine the most strongly reflected wavelength, we analyze the interference conditions for light reflecting off the thin oil layer. The setup involves three media: air (n=1), oil (n=1.5), and water (n=1.33). The key points are:

1. **Phase Shifts**:  
   - At the air-oil interface (n=1 to n=1.5), reflection causes a phase shift of π (half a wavelength).  
   - At the oil-water interface (n=1.5 to n=1.33), reflection does not cause a phase shift since the refractive index decreases.  

2. **Path Difference**:  
   The second reflected ray travels downward and upward through the oil layer, resulting in a path difference of \( 2t \), where \( t = 500 \, \text{nm} \). The wavelength of light in the oil is \( \lambda_{\text{oil}} = \lambda_{\text{air}} / n_{\text{oil}} \).  

3. **Condition for Constructive Interference**:  
   For constructive interference, the total phase difference between the two reflected rays must be an integer multiple of \( 2\pi \). This includes the phase shift from reflection and the phase difference due to the path. The condition is:  
   \[
   2n_{\text{oil}}t = (m + \frac{1}{2})\lambda_{\text{air}}
   \]  
   where \( m \) is an integer, \( n_{\text{oil}} = 1.5 \), and \( t = 500 \, \text{nm} \).  

4. **Solving for Wavelength**:  
   Rearranging the equation gives:  
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{air}} = \frac{2n_{\text{oil}}t}{m + \frac{1}{2}}
   \]  
   Substituting \( n_{\text{oil}} = 1.5 \) and \( t = 500 \, \text{nm} \):  
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{air}} = \frac{2(1.5)(500)}{m + \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1500}{m + \frac{1}{2}} \, \text{nm}
   \]  

5. **Testing Integer Values of \( m \)**:  
   - For \( m = 0 \): \( \lambda_{\text{air}} = \frac{1500}{0.5} = 3000 \, \text{nm} \) (infrared, not visible).  
   - For \( m = 1 \): \( \lambda_{\text{air}} = \frac{1500}{1.5} = 1000 \, \text{nm} \) (infrared, not visible).  
   - For \( m = 2 \): \( \lambda_{\text{air}} = \frac{1500}{2.5} = 600 \, \text{nm} \) (visible, orange-red).  
   - For \( m = 3 \): \( \lambda_{\text{air}} = \frac{1500}{3.5} \approx 428.57 \, \text{nm} \) (visible, blue).  
   - For \( m = 4 \): \( \lambda_{\text{air}} = \frac{1500}{4.5} \approx 333 \, \text{nm} \) (ultraviolet, not visible).  

6. **Conclusion**:  
   The most strongly reflected visible wavelength is \( 600 \, \text{nm} \), corresponding to option **G**.
