Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the return on investment for Pauline DiLorenzo. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on finance formulas, but I'll give it a shot.

First, the question says Pauline wants to buy a store worth $26,000. She gets a mortgage for $23,000 at 5.5% per annum. Her gross income is $3,500 and her expenses are $1,800. We need to find the return on her investment.

Hmm, return on investment (ROI) sounds like it's about how much profit she makes relative to her investment. The formula for ROI is usually (Net Profit / Cost of Investment) * 100 to get a percentage. But wait, what's the formula exactly? I think Net Profit here would be her income after expenses minus the mortgage payment. Oh wait, but wait, maybe it's the profit she makes on the investment. Alternatively, sometimes ROI is calculated using the return on the mortgage. I'm not sure which approach is right here.

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again. It says, "the return on her investment." So her investment is the mortgage amount, which is $23,000. But the store is worth $26,000, so maybe the investment is the mortgage, and the profit comes from the extra money she gets from the store. Alternatively, sometimes ROI is calculated using her net income, which is income minus expenses. Let me think more carefully.

Wait, perhaps the "return on investment" refers to the return she gets on the mortgage. So she's paying $23,000 for a $26,000 store. The mortgage covers part of the purchase price. So the profit she made through the investment is the difference between the store's value and the mortgage amount. So that's 26,000 - 23,000 = $3,000 profit. But wait, no, that's not ROI. ROI is net profit over cost. So maybe the net profit is the interest on the mortgage.

Wait, but that might not be correct because the question asks for the return on her investment, which can also refer to the profit she made on the investment. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the return on the mortgage. So, let me think: she bought the store for $23,000 and the store is worth $26,000. So the profit is $3,000. But perhaps the question is about return on the mortgage, meaning how much interest she paid on the mortgage. Let's see, the mortgage is 5.5% per annum, but I need to find the interest for a certain period. Wait, the problem doesn't specify the time period, like a year. Hmm, maybe it's annual interest.

Wait, the problem states "5.5% per annum" which is annual. So if she bought the store for $23,000, she's paying it off over time, and the interest is the cost of borrowing. So the cost of the mortgage is the interest she pays on the $23,000 at 5.5% per annum. Let me calculate that.

The formula for simple interest is I = P * r * t, where I is interest, P principal, r rate, t time in years. If we take t as 1 year, then I = 23000 * 0.055 * 1 = 1265. So the interest would be $1,265.

But wait, if she took a 1-year mortgage, the interest would be $1,265. So her net profit from the investment would be the store's value minus the mortgage amount and the interest. So 26,000 - 23,000 = 3,000 profit, minus 1,265 interest, so 1,735 profit. So ROI would be (1735 / 23000) *100 ≈ 7.54%. But looking at the options, 7.5 isn't an option. So perhaps this approach is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for her profit relative to her gross income. Let me think. Her gross income is $3,500, and expenses are $1,800. So her profit before mortgage is 3500 - 1800 = $1,700. So if her investment is the mortgage, the ROI is 1,700 / 23000 *100 ≈7.39%. Not matching the options either.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me re-examine the problem. The question says, "the return on her investment." So "investment" here is the amount she uses to buy the store, which is the mortgage amount, $23,000. Her gross income is $3,500, but that doesn't directly relate to the investment. Alternatively, perhaps the "return on investment" is the profit she makes on the investment, which is the difference between the store value and the mortgage. So that's 26,000 - 23,000 = $3,000 profit. So ROI is (3000 /23000)*100 ≈13.04%. Looking at the options, option F is 13.5%, which is close but a bit higher. Hmm, but 13% isn't exactly matching, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, but wait, the question specifies that she's buying the store for $23,000, but the store's value is $26,000. So maybe the net profit is the store's value minus her investment (the mortgage). Because she's paying $23k for the store, but the store is worth $26k. So the profit is $3k, but that's if she sold the store. But ROI is about the investment, so perhaps she's using the mortgage as the investment. So her net profit is 26,000 - 23,000 = $3,000. So ROI is 3000 / 23000 *100 = approximately 13.04%, which is about 13.0%. Looking at the options, the closest is F:13.5%. But wait, maybe the interest is considered as part of the investment.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the question is about the return on the mortgage, which is the interest rate, but that would be 5.5%, which isn't one of the options except H (17.5%) doesn't match. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait another approach: The question asks for the return on her investment, which could be the profit she makes after paying the mortgage. So the store is worth $26k, so she bought it for $23k. So the profit is $3k. But wait, that's not considering the interest. Alternatively, the return on investment could be the interest on the mortgage. So she's paying $23k, getting back $1k (as interest) over a year. So the interest is $1265, so the net return is 1265. Wait, but if her investment is the mortgage, her net profit is 26k -23k = 3k, but that doesn't include the interest. Or is the interest considered part of the investment?

Wait, maybe the question is calculating her return on investment as the difference between the store's value and her mortgage payment. So 26k -23k = 3k profit. So ROI is 3k /23k *100 ≈13.04%, which is about 13.0%, which is close to option F:13.5%. But the options don't have 13.04, but option F is 13.5.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the return on the net worth, which is the store's value minus the mortgage. So the return is 26k -23k =3k, so 3k/23k *100≈13.04%. So the answer is F:13.5%, but maybe it's calculated with simple interest and considering the time period.

Wait, wait, perhaps the time period is implied. The question doesn't specify, but sometimes ROI is calculated over a year. So using simple interest, the interest is 23000 *0.055 *1 = 1265. So her net profit is 26000-23000=3000. But wait, that's the store's value minus the mortgage. So the net profit from the store is 3000, but the interest is 1265. So her net profit after paying interest is 3000 -1265=1735. So ROI is 1735 /23000 *100 ≈7.54%. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, the interest is considered as part of the investment. So her investment is the mortgage, which she pays 23k. Her return is the interest, which is 1265. So ROI is 1265 /23000 *100≈5.52%. That's not in the options either.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the return on the gross income. Her gross income is 3500, expenses are 1800, so profit is 1700. So if the investment is her gross income, which is 3500, then ROI is 1700 /3500 *100≈48.57%. But that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about net profit divided by gross income. So 1700 /3500 *100≈48.57%. But none of the options match that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the question again. It says Pauline wants to purchase a store valued at 26,000. She obtains a mortgage for 23,000. So her mortgage is 23k. The store is worth 26k. So she's using 23k to buy a 26k store. Therefore, the "return on her investment" could be the profit she made from the mortgage.

Profit is 26k -23k =3k. So ROI is 3k /23k = approximately 13.04%. Looking at the options, option F is 13.5, which is very close. So perhaps the correct answer is F:13.5%.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the return on her investment as the interest on the mortgage. So the interest is 5.5% of 23k, which is 1265. So ROI is 1265 /23000=5.52%. But that's not one of the options except perhaps option H:17.5, which doesn't match.

Wait, another angle: sometimes ROI is calculated as (Net Profit) / (Investment). The net profit would be the store's value minus the mortgage minus the interest. So 26k -23k -1265= (26000-23000) -1265=3000-1265=1735. So ROI=1735/23000≈7.54%. But again, that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that she's using the mortgage as her investment. So the return is interest on the mortgage. So 5.5% on 23k is 1265. So ROI is 1265/23000≈5.52%. But none of the options have that except H:17.5, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the question is asking for the return on the store's value. So her investment is the store's value, which is 26k, and her gross income is 3500. Wait, no, the question says "return on her investment," which is the mortgage. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the return on the store. If the store is worth 26k, and she used 23k to buy it, then her return on investment is (26k -23k)/23k =3k/23k≈13.04%, which is about 13.0%, which is closest to option F:13.5%. But looking at the options, 13.5% is not exactly 13.04%, but perhaps the options have rounding.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about how much she makes on the investment. Her gross income is 3500, expenses 1800, profit 1700. Her investment is the mortgage, 23000. So ROI is 1700/23000≈7.39%. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the return on the store's value, which is 26k. So she makes 26k, her investment is 23k. So 26k-23k=3k profit, so ROI is 3k/23k≈13.04%, which is 13.0%. The closest option is F:13.5%. So that's the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the return on the gross income, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the net profit over the gross income. So 26k -23k=3k, which is her net profit, but she has 3k from 3500 income. So 3k /3500≈8.57%. But that's not an option either.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the options again. All the options are well above 5%, except G:9.5. So perhaps the correct answer is F:13.5%, which is the closest to my calculation of 13.04%.

The problem requires calculating the return on investment (ROI) for Pauline DiLorenzo. She purchased a store valued at $26,000 with a mortgage of $23,000. The store's value is $26,000, and her gross income is $3,500 with expenses of $1,800, resulting in a profit of $1,700. The question asks for ROI, which is calculated as net profit divided by the investment.

1. **Net Profit**: The store's value ($26,000) minus the mortgage ($23,000) equals $3,000 profit. However, this does not account for the interest on the mortgage.
2. **Interest on Mortgage**: The annual interest on a $23,000 mortgage at 5.5% is $1,265 ($23,000 * 0.055).
3. **Net Profit After Interest**: Subtracting the interest from the net profit gives $1,735 ($3,000 - $1,265).
4. **ROI Calculation**: ROI is ($1,735 / $23,000) * 100 ≈ 7.54%. This is closest to option F: 13.5%, but the calculation shows a much lower value. However, considering the options provided, the closest match is F: 13.5%.
