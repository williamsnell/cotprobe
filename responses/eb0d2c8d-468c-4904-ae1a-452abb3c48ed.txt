Okay, so I've got this question about polonium-210 and how many alpha particles it emits per second. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, I remember that alpha particles are helium nuclei, so each decay of Po-210 emits one alpha particle. So, the number of decays per second is the same as the number of alpha particles emitted per second. That makes sense.

The question gives me the mass of Po-210 as 4 × 10^-12 grams. Wait, that's a really tiny amount. And the half-life is 138 days. I think I need to find the number of moles of Po-210 first, then find the number of nuclei, and then use the decay constant to find the activity.

Let me jot down what I know:

Mass of Po-210 (m) = 4e-12 g = 4 × 10^-12 g.

Half-life (t₁/₂) = 138 days. I'll need to convert this into seconds because the answer is per second. Days to seconds: 138 days × 24 hours/day × 3600 seconds/hour. Let me calculate that.

138 × 24 = 3312 hours. 3312 × 3600 = let's see, 3312 * 3600. Hmm, 3312 * 3600. Well, 3000*3600=10,800,000, 312*3600=1,123,200. So total is 10,800,000 + 1,123,200 = 11,923,200 seconds. So t₁/₂ = 1.19232e7 seconds.

Next, I need the molar mass of Po-210. Polonium has an atomic number around 84, so the molar mass should be approximately 210 g/mol because it's Po-210. So M = 210 g/mol.

Now, number of moles (n) = mass (m) / molar mass (M) = (4e-12 g) / 210 g/mol. Let's compute that:

4e-12 / 210 = approximately 1.90476e-14 mol. So n ≈ 1.9048e-14 mol.

Then, number of nuclei (N) is moles multiplied by Avogadro's number (6.022e23 mol^-1). So N = n * N_A.

N = 1.9048e-14 mol * 6.022e23 atoms/mol.

Let me calculate that: 1.9048e-14 * 6.022e23 = (1.9048 * 6.022) * 10^(9). 1.9048 *6.022 ≈ 11.47, so 11.47e9 = 1.147e10 atoms. So N ≈ 1.147e10 nuclei.

Now, the decay constant (λ) is ln(2) / t₁/₂. So λ = 0.6931 / t_half.

λ = 0.6931 / 1.19232e7 s ≈ let me compute that. 0.6931 / 1.19232e7 ≈ approximately 5.813e-8 per second.

Wait, let me do the division more accurately. 0.6931 divided by 1.19232e7: let's see, 0.6931 / 1.19232 = approximately 0.5813. So 0.5813e-7, which is 5.813e-8 per second.

Now, activity (A) is λ * N. So A = 5.813e-8 s^-1 * 1.147e10 atoms.

Calculating that: 5.813e-8 * 1.147e10 = (5.813 * 1.147) * 1e2.

5.813 * 1.147 ≈ let me compute that. 5 *1.147=5.735, 0.813*1.147≈0.932. So total ≈ 5.735 +0.932=6.667. So 6.667e2 = 666.7 nuclei per second.

Looking at the options, option J is 666.94, which is very close. So the answer should be J.

To determine the number of alpha particles emitted per second from 4 × 10⁻¹² g of Po-210, we follow these steps:

1. **Convert the half-life to seconds**:  
   The half-life of Po-210 is 138 days. Converting to seconds:  
   \[
   138 \, \text{days} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} \times 3600 \, \text{seconds/hour} = 11,923,200 \, \text{seconds} = 1.19232 \times 10^7 \, \text{seconds}.
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of moles of Po-210**:  
   The molar mass of Po-210 is approximately 210 g/mol. The number of moles (\(n\)) is:  
   \[
   n = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molar mass}} = \frac{4 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{g}}{210 \, \text{g/mol}} = 1.9048 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{mol}.
   \]

3. **Determine the number of nuclei (\(N\))**:  
   Using Avogadro's number (\(N_A = 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{atoms/mol}\)):  
   \[
   N = n \times N_A = 1.9048 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{mol} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{atoms/mol} = 1.147 \times 10^{10} \, \text{atoms}.
   \]

4. **Calculate the decay constant (\(\lambda\))**:  
   The decay constant is given by:  
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} = \frac{0.6931}{1.19232 \times 10^7 \, \text{s}} \approx 5.813 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{s}^{-1}.
   \]

5. **Determine the activity (\(A\))**:  
   Activity is the number of decays per second and is calculated as:  
   \[
   A = \lambda \times N = 5.813 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{s}^{-1} \times 1.147 \times 10^{10} \, \text{atoms} \approx 666.7 \, \text{nuclei/second}.
   \]

Comparing this result with the options provided, the closest match is **J: 666.94 nuclei/second**.
