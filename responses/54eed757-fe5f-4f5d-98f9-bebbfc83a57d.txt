Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here with three parts, and I'm a bit nervous because stoichiometry can get tricky. But I'll take it step by step. Let's see what each part is asking.

The reaction given is Fe₂(SO₄)₃ + 3BaCl₂ → 3BaSO₄↓ + 2FeCl₃. I remember from class that the coefficients here are important for mole ratios.

Part A asks: How much BaCl₂ should be used to react with 10 grams of Fe₂(SO₄)₃?

Alright, so I need to find the mass of BaCl₂ required to react with 10 grams of Fe₂(SO₄)₃. Let's break this down.

First, I think I should find the molar mass of Fe₂(SO₄)₃. Let's calculate that.

Fe: 55.85 g/mol. Since there are 2 Fe atoms, 2 * 55.85 = 111.7 g/mol.

Sulfur (S): 32.07 g/mol. Each SO₄ has one S, and there are 3 SO₄ groups, so 3 * 32.07 = 96.21 g/mol.

Oxygen (O): Each SO₄ has 4 O's, so 4 * 16.00 = 64 g/mol per SO₄. There are 3 SO₄ groups, so 3 * 64 = 192 g/mol.

Adding them up: Fe is 111.7, S is 96.21, O is 192. So total molar mass is 111.7 + 96.21 + 192 = 399.91 g/mol. Let me double-check that. Wait, Fe₂(SO₄)₃ is Fe₂(SO₄)3, so yeah, 2 Fe, 3 SO₄. I think that's correct.

Now, the moles of Fe₂(SO₄)₃ in 10 grams would be grams divided by molar mass. So 10 g / 399.91 g/mol ≈ 0.025004 moles.

Looking at the balanced equation, the mole ratio between Fe₂(SO₄)₃ and BaCl₂ is 1:3. So for every mole of Fe₂(SO₄)₃, 3 moles of BaCl₂ are needed.

So moles of BaCl₂ needed = 0.025004 mol * 3 = 0.075012 mol.

Now, the molar mass of BaCl₂. Ba is 137.33 g/mol, Cl is about 35.45 each. So BaCl₂ is 137.33 + 2*35.45 = 137.33 +70.90 = 208.23 g/mol.

Mass of BaCl₂ = moles * molar mass = 0.075012 mol * 208.23 g/mol ≈ Let me calculate that. 0.075 * 208 = around 15.6, but more accurately:

0.075012 * 208.23 = 

Let me compute 208.23 * 0.075:

0.075 * 200 = 15, 0.075 *8.23= ~0.61725. So total approx 15.61725 grams. Wait, but looking at the options, the first value for part A is around 15.6, but the options don't have that. Wait, let me check again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the molar mass of Fe₂(SO₄)₃. Let me recalculate that.

Fe: 55.85 *2 = 111.7.

S: 32.07 *3 =96.21.

O: 16.00 * (4*3) = 16*12=192.

So total: 111.7 +96.21=207.91 +192=399.91 g/mol. Correct.

Moles of Fe₂(SO₄)₃: 10 / 399.91 ≈ 0.025004 mol.

BaCl₂ needed: 0.025004 *3 = 0.075012 mol.

Molar mass BaCl₂: Ba is 137.33, Cl is 35.45 each, so 137.33 +70.9=208.23 g/mol.

0.075012 *208.23 = ?

Let me compute 0.075 *208.23:

0.075 * 200 =15, 0.075 *8.23=0.61725. So total is 15.61725 grams. So approximately 15.62 grams. Looking at the options, part A's first value is 15.62 in option H. Let's keep that in mind but let me proceed to check the other parts because maybe I made a mistake.

Part B: How much Fe₂(SO₄)3 is needed to produce 100 g of BaSO4?

So, moles of BaSO4 produced = 100g / molar mass of BaSO4.

Ba: 137.33, S:32.07, O:4*16=64. So BaSO4 molar mass is 137.33 +32.07 +64 = 233.4 g/mol.

Moles BaSO4 = 100 /233.4 ≈ 0.4284 moles.

From the balanced equation, the mole ratio between BaSO4 and Fe₂(SO₄)3 is 3:1. So moles of Fe₂(SO₄)3 needed = moles BaSO4 /3 = 0.4284 /3 ≈ 0.1428 moles.

Mass of Fe₂(SO₄)3 needed = moles * molar mass = 0.1428 * 399.91 ≈ Let me calculate that.

0.1428 *400 =57.12, but since it's 399.91, maybe 57.12 - 0.12*0.1428 ≈ wait, 399.91 is 0.09 less than 400. So 0.1428 *399.91 = 0.1428*(400 -0.09) = (0.1428*400) - (0.1428 *0.09) =57.12 -0.012852≈57.107 grams. Rounded to about 57.11 grams.

Looking at the options, the second value for part B. Let's see options:

Option H for part B is 57.11 grams. That matches.

Part C: From a mixture of 50g Fe₂(SO₄)3 and 100g BaCl₂, how much FeCl3 can be produced?

This is a limiting reagent problem. I need to find which reactant is limiting and then calculate the moles of FeCl3 based on that.

First, find moles of each reactant.

Molar mass Fe₂(SO₄)3 is 399.91 g/mol as before.

Moles Fe₂(SO₄)3: 50 g /399.91 ≈ 0.12502 moles.

Molar mass BaCl₂ is 208.23 g/mol.

Moles BaCl₂: 100g /208.23 ≈0.4796 moles.

The reaction ratio is 1 Fe₂(SO₄)3 :3 BaCl₂.

So, let's see how much BaCl₂ is needed for the available Fe₂(SO₄)3.

Required BaCl₂ = 0.12502 *3 =0.37506 moles.

But available BaCl₂ is 0.4796 moles, which is more than required. So Fe₂(SO₄)3 is the limiting reagent.

Now, the product is FeCl3. The mole ratio is 2 FeCl3 per 1 Fe₂(SO₄)3.

So moles FeCl3 = 0.12502 *2 =0.25004 moles.

Molar mass FeCl3: Fe is 55.85, Cl is 35.45 each. So 55.85 +3*35.45=55.85 +106.35=162.2 g/mol.

Mass FeCl3 = 0.25004 *162.2 ≈0.25 *162.2 =40.55 grams.

Looking at the options, the third value for part C is 40.56 grams in option H. So that seems to match.

Wait, let me check again:

Wait, in part C, the calculation for moles of FeCl3: 0.12502 *2=0.25004, then 0.25004 *162.2 = ?

0.25 *162.2=40.55. So 40.55 grams. The option H says 40.56 grams, which is very close, so that's correct.

So putting it all together, the answers for parts A, B, and C are approximately 15.62g, 57.11g, and 40.56g, respectively. Looking at the options, option H is 15.62, 57.11, 40.56. So the correct answer would be option H.

The correct answer is determined by calculating each part step by step using stoichiometric principles. For part (A), the mass of BaCl₂ required is found by converting grams of Fe₂(SO₄)₃ to moles, using the mole ratio from the balanced equation, and then converting moles to grams. For part (B), the moles of BaSO₄ are calculated, and using the mole ratio, the moles and then grams of Fe₂(SO₄)₃ are determined. In part (C), the limiting reagent is identified, and the moles of FeCl₃ are calculated based on the limiting reactant. The results match option H.

Answer: H
