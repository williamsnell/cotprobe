Okay, so I've got this question about capacitors connected in series, and I need to find the equivalent capacitance. Hmm, I remember that capacitors can be connected in different ways—series and parallel. I think the way they're connected affects the total or equivalent capacitance. Let me try to recall what I learned in class.

Wait, the question says there are five capacitors, each of 5 microfarads, connected in series. So all of them are connected one after another. I remember that in a series connection, the equivalent capacitance is less than the smallest individual capacitance. But wait, all the capacitors here are the same, so the equivalent should definitely be smaller than 5 µF.

I think the formula for capacitors in series is 1/C_eq = 1/C1 + 1/C2 + ... + 1/Cn. Since all capacitors are the same here, each is 5 µF. So for five capacitors in series, it would be 1/C_eq = 5*(1/5) because each is 5 µF. Let me compute that. 

1/C_eq = 5*(1/5) µF^-1. Let me calculate that. 1/5 is 0.2. So 5 times 0.2 is 1. So 1/C_eq equals 1. Therefore, C_eq must be 1/1, which is 1 µF. Wait, that can't be right, because five in series should add reciprocally. Oh wait, wait, no—the formula is correct. Each 5 µF in series adds 1/5 each. So 5 of them would be 5*(1/5) = 1. So C_eq is 1/1 = 1 µF. 

Looking at the options, option H is 1 µF. So that's the answer. Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes I mix up series and parallel. Let me think again. In parallel, the equivalent capacitance is the sum of all capacitances, right? So if they were in parallel, it would be 5 +5+5+5+5 =25 µF, which is option I. But the question is about series, so that's not the case here. 

Another way to think about it: when capacitors are in series, the reciprocal of the equivalent capacitance is the sum of reciprocals. So for n identical capacitors, each of C, the equivalent would be C/n. Oh wait, that's right! So each is 5 µF, and n=5, so 5/5=1 µF. Yep, that's correct. So the answer should be H:1 µF.

The equivalent capacitance of capacitors connected in series is calculated using the formula \( \frac{1}{C_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} + \dots + \frac{1}{C_n} \). For five identical capacitors of 5 µF each, this becomes \( \frac{1}{C_{\text{eq}}} = 5 \times \frac{1}{5} = 1 \), so \( C_{\text{eq}} = 1 \, \mu\text{F} \). 

Answer: H
