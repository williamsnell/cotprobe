B: If a real and imminent risk (of death/harm)
C: A state should take reasonable steps to prevent death/harm occurring
D: A state knows or ought to have known

Okay, so I have this question about the Osman v UK case from 1998, and I need to figure out which statement is not part of the Osman test. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that Osman was a case where the European Court of Human Rights established a test for when a state can be held responsible for failing to protect an individual's rights. It's under Article 2, which deals with the right to life. The test is about when a state has a positive obligation to prevent harm or death.

The question is asking which of the options is NOT part of that test. So I need to recall each part of the Osman test. From what I remember, the test has a few key components. 

I think the first part is whether the risk was known or should have been known to the state. That's because the state needs to have some awareness of the risk to be expected to act. So option D says, "A state knows or ought to have known," which sounds familiar as part of the test. So D is part of the test, meaning it's not the correct answer here.

Next, I believe the risk has to be real and imminent. That makes sense because the state shouldn't be responsible for every possible risk that's too vague or not immediate. Option B states, "If a real and imminent risk (of death/harm)," which aligns with that part of the test. So B is part of the test, meaning it's not the answer we're looking for.

Then, the state must have taken reasonable steps to prevent the harm. Option C says, "A state should take reasonable steps to prevent death/harm occurring." That definitely sounds like part of the test. So C is included, making it not the correct answer.

Now, looking at option A: "The risk must emanate from a state agent." I'm a bit unsure about this one. I think the Osman test applies when the risk is from a state agent, but wait, isn't it more about whether the state had the capacity to prevent it, regardless of the source? Or is the source a requirement? I might be mixing this up with other cases.

Wait, in Osman, the risk was from a private individual, an ex-husband who was threatening his wife. The state knew about the threats but didn't act. So the risk didn't emanate from a state agent; it was from a private party. So the test doesn't require the risk to come from a state agent. Therefore, option A is not part of the test. That would make A the correct answer because the question is asking which is NOT part of the test.

So putting it all together: the test requires that the state knew or should have known (D is part of it), the risk was real and imminent (B is part of it), and that the state should take reasonable steps (C is part of it). The risk doesn't have to come from a state agent, as seen in the Osman case itself. Therefore, option A is not part of the test.

The correct answer is:

**A: The risk must emanate from a state agent**

The Osman test does not require the risk to originate from a state agent. It focuses on whether the state knew or should have known about a real and imminent risk, and whether they took reasonable steps to prevent harm. The risk can come from any source, not necessarily a state agent.

Answer: A
