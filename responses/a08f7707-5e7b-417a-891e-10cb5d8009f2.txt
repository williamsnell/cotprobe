Okay, so I need to figure out what Anscombe said about "moral obligation." I'm not super familiar with her work, but I remember she was a 20th-century philosopher who wrote about ethics. I think she had some criticisms of certain ethical theories.

The question is asking what "moral obligation" currently signifies according to Anscombe. The options are from A to J, so I need to match her view to one of these.

I recall that Anscombe was critical of modern moral philosophy, especially the idea of moral obligation as something separate from human nature or actions. She thought that the concept of "moral obligation" was a bit muddled. She might have argued that it doesn't refer to something real but is more of a confused idea.

Looking at the options, let's go through them:

A: Beliefs of a culture. Hmm, that seems more like relativism, but I don't think that's what she focused on.

B: Laws of a country. That's legal obligation, not moral.

C: Thoughts of an influential person. Maybe like a leader's ideas, but I don't think that's what moral obligation is about.

D: Commands of God. That's more like divine command theory, which she might have discussed, but I'm not sure if she thought that's what moral obligation is.

E: Feelings of an individual. That sounds more like emotions, but moral obligation is more about duties, so maybe not.

F: Desires of a community. That's more of a utilitarian or social contract idea, perhaps.

G: No real concept at all. Oh, this rings a bell. I think she argued that the term "moral obligation" is not referring to anything real. She might have said that it's a confused notion because it implies a duty that isn't grounded in anything substantial.

H: Teachings of philosophy. That seems like it would be more about theory than the actual concept.

I: Norms of society. That's similar to social conventions, but I think she's more critical of that approach.

J: Rules of a religious institution. Again, that's more specific to religious contexts, not the general concept.

Putting it together, I think the answer is G: no real concept at all. Anscombe likely argued that the idea of moral obligation doesn't point to anything real and is a misuse of language.
