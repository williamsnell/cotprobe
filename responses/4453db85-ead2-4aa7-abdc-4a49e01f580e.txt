Okay, so I've got this logic problem to solve. It's about finding which proposition is an immediate consequence of the given premises in propositional logic (PL). I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

First, let me list out the premises:

1. ~E ⊃ ~F
2. G ⊃ F
3. H ∨ ~E
4. H ⊃ I
5. ~I

And the options are A through J, each with a different proposition. I need to figure out which one follows directly from these premises in one step.

Starting with the premises:

Premise 1: ~E implies ~F. So if E is not true, then F is not true. Alternatively, this can be read as F is a necessary condition for E because if E isn't there, F isn't either. Another way to write this is E ∨ ~F, using the equivalence of implications.

Premise 2: G implies F. So G is a sufficient condition for F. If G is true, then F must be true. Alternatively, this is F ∨ ~G.

Premise 3: H or not E. So either H is true, or E isn't. This could lead us to think about the contrapositive or maybe using other rules of inference.

Premise 4: H implies I. So if H is true, then I must be true. Alternatively, this is ~I ∨ H.

Premise 5: Not I. So I is false.

Now, looking for immediate consequences. Immediate in PL usually means a single step using a rule like modus ponens, modus tollens, hypothetical syllogism, disjunctive syllogism, etc.

Let me see what each premise can give me.

Starting with premise 5: ~I. That's given. Now, looking at premise 4: H ⊃ I. So if H is true, then I is true. But since we know I is false (~I), we can use modus tollens on premise 4.

Modus tollens says that if P ⊃ Q is true, and ~Q is true, then ~P must be true. So here, P is H, Q is I. Since H ⊃ I and ~I, we can conclude ~H.

So that gives us ~H. Now, looking at the options, option E is ~H. So that's one possibility.

Wait, but let me check if there are other steps that can be taken. Maybe from premise 3: H ∨ ~E, and if we have ~H, we can use disjunctive syllogism.

Disjunctive syllogism says that if we have a disjunction (A ∨ B) and ~A, we can conclude B. Here, H ∨ ~E and ~H would lead to ~E.

So from premise 3 and the conclusion ~H, we can get ~E.

Now, with ~E, let's look at premise 1: ~E ⊃ ~F. So if ~E is true, then ~F must be true. Alternatively, this means F is false because ~E is true.

So from premise 1 and ~E, we can conclude ~F. So now we have ~F.

Looking at premise 2: G ⊃ F. If G is true, then F must be true. But since we have ~F, we can use modus tollens here as well. So G ⊃ F, and ~F implies ~G. So we can conclude ~G.

So from that, we have ~G. Now, looking at the options, option G is ~G, so that's another possible answer.

Wait, but the question is asking for an immediate consequence. So each step I took was one step, but the question is about which proposition is an immediate consequence. So perhaps each step is an immediate consequence, but the question is which of the options is one of them.

Wait, but the options are individual propositions, so perhaps each step is an immediate consequence, and the options include some of these.

But let me go back. The question says "which of the following propositions is an immediate (one-step) consequence in PL of the given premises?"

So each premise can be used in one step. Let's see each option and see if it can be derived in one step.

Option A: ~H ⊃ I. Hmm. Let's see. Do we have a way to derive this? I don't think so directly. Our premises don't directly lead to this without more steps.

Option B: G ⊃ ~F. Let's see. From premise 2, G ⊃ F. If we can derive F ⊃ something else, perhaps, but I don't see a direct way to get G ⊃ ~F in one step.

Option C: H ⊃ ~E. Let's see. From premise 3, H ∨ ~E. If we had H, then we could conclude ~E. But that would require H, which we can get from ~H via the law of excluded middle, but that's more than one step. Alternatively, using hypothetical syllogism with premise 4 and premise 3, but I'm not sure.

Option D: I ⊃ H. Hmm, not sure. From premise 4, H ⊃ I, which is equivalent to ~I ∨ H. But we have ~I, which gives us H via disjunctive syllogism, but that's a step we already did.

Option E: ~H. Yes, as we found earlier using modus tollens on premise 4. So this is an immediate consequence.

Option F: H ⊃ F. Let's see. From premise 4, H ⊃ I, and from premise 5, ~I, so H would lead to I, which is false, so H must be false. But I'm not sure if H ⊃ F is directly derivable. Alternatively, maybe using other premises.

Option G: ~G. We derived this using modus tollens on premise 2 after getting ~F from premise 1 and premise 3.

Option H: F ⊃ ~E. Let's see. From premise 1, ~E ⊃ ~F, which is equivalent to F ∨ ~E. Wait, no, the contrapositive of ~E ⊃ ~F is F ⊃ E. Because contrapositive swaps and negates. So ~E ⊃ ~F is equivalent to F ∨ ~E? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The implication ~E → ~F is logically equivalent to F ∨ ~E. So that's the same as H ∨ ~E, which is premise 3. Wait, no, premise 3 is H ∨ ~E, which is different from F ∨ ~E. So perhaps that's not directly helpful.

Alternatively, from premise 1, ~E → ~F, which is equivalent to F → E. So if F is true, then E is true. So F → E. But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful for option H, which is F → ~E. That doesn't seem right because F → E would mean that if F is true, E must be true, so F can't imply ~E unless E is both true and false, which isn't possible. So option H seems incorrect.

Option I: E → F. Let's see. From premise 1, ~E → ~F. The contrapositive of that is F → E. So E is a necessary condition for F. So E must be true if F is true. But E → F would be the original statement, but premise 1 is ~E → ~F, which is equivalent to F ∨ ~E, which is the same as E → F. Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify:

The statement ~E → ~F is logically equivalent to E ∨ ~F, which is the same as F → E. So E is a necessary condition for F. So F → E, not E → F. So option I says E → F, which would be the converse of F → E, and that's not necessarily true. So option I is not derivable.

Option J: F → G. Let's see. From premise 2, G → F, which is equivalent to ~F ∨ G. If we can derive F → G, that would mean if F is true, then G must be true. But premise 2 says G implies F, not the other way around. So unless we have additional information, we can't conclude F → G. So option J is not directly derivable.

So from this analysis, the options E (~H) and G (~G) are immediate consequences. Wait, but the question asks which of the options is an immediate consequence. So perhaps both E and G are correct, but looking back at the options, I need to see which one is correct.

Wait, but the options are A to J, and the question is which one is an immediate consequence. So perhaps both E and G are correct, but looking at the options, the answer would be one of them.

But wait, in the initial step, using premise 4 and 5, we derived ~H (option E). Then, using premise 3 and ~H, we derived ~E, which with premise 1 gave us ~F. Then, using premise 2 and ~F, we derived ~G (option G).

So both E and G are immediate consequences, but the question is which one is an immediate consequence. However, the options are single propositions, so perhaps each step is an immediate consequence. But the question is asking which of the options is an immediate consequence, so perhaps both E and G are correct, but looking at the options, the possible answers are E and G.

Wait, but the options are given as E: ~H and G: ~G. So both are possible, but the question is which one is an immediate consequence. But I think the question allows for multiple correct answers, but since it's a multiple-choice, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again.

From premise 4 (H → I) and premise 5 (~I), using modus tollens, we get ~H. So ~H is an immediate consequence. So option E is correct.

Then, from premise 3 (H ∨ ~E) and ~H, using disjunctive syllogism, we get ~E. So ~E is a consequence, but that's two steps, so not immediate.

Then, from premise 1 (~E → ~F) and ~E, we get ~F. So that's another step.

Then, from premise 2 (G → F) and ~F, we get ~G. So ~G is an immediate consequence, but that's after two steps. Wait, no, each step is one step. So from premise 2 and ~F, we can derive ~G in one step using modus tollens. So ~G is also an immediate consequence, but that would be after deriving ~F, which itself is derived in one step from premise 1 and ~E.

Wait, but the question is about which proposition is an immediate consequence of the premises. So each step is an immediate consequence. So both ~H and ~G are immediate consequences, but looking at the options, both E and G are present.

But the question is which one is correct, so perhaps both are correct, but the options only allow one choice. Wait, no, perhaps only one of them is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me list the immediate consequences:

1. From premises 4 and 5: ~H (option E) is an immediate consequence.

2. From premises 1, 3, and the previous step: ~E, which leads to ~F (from premise 1), which leads to ~G (from premise 2). But ~G is an immediate consequence, but it's derived in two steps. So perhaps the immediate consequences are ~H and ~G, but the question is about which is an immediate consequence, so both E and G are correct. But the options only allow one choice, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for any immediate consequence, so both E and G are correct, but the options are separate. Let me check the options again:

Options:

A: ~H ⊃ I

B: G ⊃ ~F

C: H ⊃ ~E

D: I ⊃ H

E: ~H

F: H ⊃ F

G: ~G

H: F ⊃ ~E

I: E ⊃ F

J: F ⊃ G

So both E (~H) and G (~G) are options. But the question is which is an immediate consequence. So perhaps both are correct, but the options are given as E and G. However, the question likely expects one answer.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E and G, but the options are separate. But since the question is a multiple-choice with one correct answer, perhaps the intended answer is E. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G.

Wait, let me think again. The steps are:

1. From premise 4 and 5: ~H (E).

2. From premise 3 and ~H: ~E.

3. From premise 1 and ~E: ~F.

4. From premise 2 and ~F: ~G (G).

So both E and G are immediate consequences, but the question is which of the options is an immediate consequence. So both E and G are correct, but the options list them as separate. However, the question may be looking for the first one, which is E.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E and G, but the options don't allow for multiple selections, so perhaps the intended answer is E.

Wait, but the user instruction says to select one answer from A to J. So perhaps the correct answer is E and G, but the options are separate. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, as that's the first immediate consequence, and the others require more steps.

Wait, but the question is about which proposition is an immediate consequence, so each step is an immediate consequence. So both E and G are correct, but the options include both.

But looking at the options, E is ~H, which is derived immediately from premises 4 and 5. G is ~G, which is derived immediately from premises 2 and ~F, which itself is derived from premises 1 and ~E, which is derived from premises 3 and ~H.

So the question is whether the steps are considered one step each. So each inference is one step, so both ~H and ~G are immediate consequences, but perhaps the answer expects both, but the options are separate. Since the user is asking for one answer, perhaps the intended answer is E and G. But the options don't combine them, so perhaps the answer is E.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is both E and G, but the options don't allow for that. So perhaps the correct answer is E and G, but given the options, the user may have intended one of them.

Wait, but the user's question says "which of the following propositions is an immediate (one-step) consequence in PL of the given premises?" So each step is one step, so both E and G are immediate consequences. But the options are separate, so perhaps both are correct, but the user expects one.

Wait, perhaps I should look for which of the options is directly derivable in one step without considering the intermediate steps. So from the premises, using one rule, which of the options can be derived.

Let me try that approach.

Looking at each option and see if it can be derived in one step from the premises.

Option E: ~H.

From premises 4 (H → I) and 5 (~I), using modus tollens, we can derive ~H. So that's one step. So E is correct.

Option G: ~G.

To derive ~G, we need to go through several steps: from premises 4 and 5, get ~H, then from premise 3, get ~E, then from premise 1, get ~F, then from premise 2, get ~G. That's four steps, so ~G is a consequence but not immediate. So G is not an immediate consequence, but a consequence after multiple steps.

Wait, but modus tollens can be applied directly to premise 2 if we have F, but we don't have F. Alternatively, using other rules.

Wait, perhaps I can derive ~G in one step using hypothetical syllogism.

Hypothetical syllogism: If P → Q and Q → R, then P → R.

Looking at premises 2 and 1:

Premise 2: G → F.

Premise 1: ~E → ~F.

But to apply hypothetical syllogism, we need a chain where the consequents match. So if we can derive F → something, maybe.

Wait, perhaps I can chain premise 2 (G → F) with premise 1's contrapositive (F → E), because premise 1 is ~E → ~F, which is equivalent to F → E.

So G → F and F → E would allow us to conclude G → E.

But how does that help us get ~G?

Alternatively, if we can derive F → E, and if we have H ∨ ~E, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using disjunctive syllogism on premise 3.

But I think the only immediate consequence in one step is ~H (option E).

So the answer is E.
</think>

The immediate consequence in one step is derived using modus tollens on premises 4 (H → I) and 5 (~I), leading to ~H.

Answer: E
