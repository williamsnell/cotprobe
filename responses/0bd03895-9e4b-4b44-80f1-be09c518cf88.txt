Okay, so I have this question about biomes, and I need to figure out which one it is. Let me read the question again carefully. It says, "This biome contains plants whose roots cannot go deep due to the presence of a permafrost." Hmm, permafrost means the ground is permanently frozen, right? So the roots can't go deep because they would hit that frozen layer.

Let me think about the different biomes. The options are A through J, which include Savanna, Taiga, Tundra, Chaparral, Alpine, Grassland, Desert, Wetlands, Deciduous forests, and Rainforest.

I remember that permafrost is a characteristic of the tundra biome. The tundra is the coldest of all the biomes and has that layer of permafrost. Plants there are mostly low-growing because they can't grow tall, and their roots can't go deep. They usually grow in shallow soil on top of the permafrost, which is called the active layer.

Wait, let me make sure. The taiga is a coniferous forest, right? It's in areas that are a bit south of the tundra. The ground there isn't permafrosted as much because the climate is a bit milder. So the roots can go deeper there. So it's not the taiga.

The Savanna has deep-rooted grasses and trees, so that's not it. Grasslands also have deep roots because they need to reach water, which isn't as available on the surface. Deserts have plants with root systems that go deep to find water, too. Wetlands have varied vegetation, but I don't think permafrost is a feature there. Deciduous forests and rainforests have rich soils and deeper root systems as well.

So the only biome left that fits is the Tundra. That's option C. Yeah, I'm pretty confident now.

The biome described is the Tundra, where permafrost prevents deep root growth.
