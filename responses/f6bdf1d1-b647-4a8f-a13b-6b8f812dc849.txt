Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is about a swimmer diving off a platform and finding the acceleration of the Earth as the swimmer falls. Hmm, that's interesting because usually we think of the Earth as not moving, but in reality, both the swimmer and Earth would exert forces on each other.

Alright, the swimmer's mass is 60 kg, and the platform is 3 meters high. But wait, the height probably doesn't matter here because the question is about acceleration, not velocity or time. So maybe I can ignore the height unless it's needed for something else, but let's see.

The Earth's mass is given as approximately 6 × 10^24 kg. The question is asking for the acceleration of the Earth as the swimmer falls. I remember from Newton's third law that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. So when the swimmer jumps off, the Earth exerts a force on the swimmer, and the swimmer exerts an equal force on the Earth.

Wait, but how do I find the acceleration of the Earth? Oh right, using Newton's second law, F=ma. But first, I need to find the force between the swimmer and Earth, which is the gravitational force. The formula for gravitational force is F = G*(m1*m2)/r², where G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses, and r is the distance between their centers.

In this case, the swimmer is on the Earth's surface, so r would be the Earth's radius. But wait, the problem doesn't give the radius, but since the height is 3 meters, which is much smaller than Earth's radius (about 6,371 km), maybe r is approximately the Earth's radius. But wait, the problem might be simplifying it by assuming that the swimmer is at the Earth's surface, so r is the Earth's radius, R_earth.

But wait, I think in this problem, since the swimmer is on the platform, which is 3 meters high, the distance from the swimmer's center of mass to Earth's center is approximately the Earth's radius plus 3 meters. But since Earth's radius is so large, adding 3 meters is negligible. So r ≈ R_earth.

But wait, maybe the problem is considering the acceleration due to the swimmer's force on Earth. So the force the swimmer exerts on Earth is equal to the force Earth exerts on the swimmer. So F = m_swimmer * g, where g is the acceleration due to gravity at Earth's surface, which is about 9.8 m/s². So F = 60 kg * 9.8 m/s² = 588 N.

Now, to find the acceleration of Earth, I use F = m_earth * a_earth. So a_earth = F / m_earth = 588 N / (6 × 10^24 kg). Let me calculate that.

588 divided by 6 is 98, so 98 × 10^-24 m/s². Wait, that's 9.8 × 10^-23 m/s². Let me check the options. Option J is 9.8 × 10^-23 m/s². So that seems right.

Wait, but wait another thing. The gravitational force between the Earth and the swimmer is actually calculated using Newton's law of gravitation, F = G*(m1*m2)/r². But since the swimmer is on Earth's surface, r is R_earth. But G is 6.674×10^-11 N·m²/kg². So let me compute it that way to see if I get the same a_earth.

F = G * (60 kg * 6e24 kg) / R_earth². Wait, no, that's the force Earth exerts on the swimmer. But the Earth's acceleration would be a = F / m_earth = (G * m_swimmer) / R_earth². Because F = m_swimmer * g = G * m_earth * m_swimmer / R_earth². So solving for a_earth: a = F / m_earth = (G * m_swimmer) / R_earth².

But wait, g is equal to G*M_earth / R_earth², so g = 9.8 m/s². So rearranging, a_earth = g * m_swimmer / M_earth.

Oh wait, that makes sense. So a_earth = (m_swimmer / M_earth) * g. Because the force F is m_swimmer * g, and a_earth is F / M_earth.

So plugging in the numbers: a_earth = (60 kg / 6e24 kg) * 9.8 m/s². Let's compute that.

60 / 6e24 = 1e-23, because 6e24 is 6 followed by 24 zeros, so 60 is 6e1, so 6e1 /6e24 = 1e-23.

Then multiply by 9.8: 9.8 * 1e-23 = 9.8e-23 m/s². So that's 9.8 × 10^-23 m/s², which matches option J.

So the correct answer should be J.

The problem involves determining the acceleration of the Earth when a 60 kg swimmer dives from a 3-meter-high platform. Using Newton's third law and the principle of action-reaction, the swimmer and Earth exert equal and opposite forces on each other. The gravitational force between them is calculated using Newton's law of gravitation, and the Earth's acceleration is derived using Newton's second law.

The force the swimmer exerts on Earth is equal to the force Earth exerts on the swimmer, which is \( F = m_{\text{swimmer}} \cdot g \), where \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \). Substituting the values, \( F = 60 \cdot 9.8 = 588 \, \text{N} \).

To find the Earth's acceleration, \( a_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{F}{M_{\text{Earth}}} \), where \( M_{\text{Earth}} = 6 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg} \). Substituting, \( a_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{588}{6 \times 10^{24}} = 9.8 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{m/s}^2 \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

J: \( 9.8 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{m/s}^2 \).
