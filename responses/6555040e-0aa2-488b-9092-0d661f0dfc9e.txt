Okay, so I've got this question about the subjunctive mood in English. The question is asking which of the given sentences is written in the subjunctive. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the subjunctive mood is used to express wishes, hypothetical situations, or demands. It's different from the indicative mood, which is used for facts and statements. The subjunctive often uses the base form of the verb, especially after certain verbs like "wish," "if," or "demand."

Looking at the options:

Option A: "If only your man was here." Hmm, "was" is the past tense. I think in the subjunctive, after "if only," we use the past tense even for present situations. So this might be subjunctive, but I'm not entirely sure.

Option B: "I wish I were your man." I remember that "wish" is a key word for the subjunctive. After "wish," we use "were" regardless of the subject. So this definitely sounds subjunctive. The correct structure is "wish + were" for hypothetical or contrary-to-fact situations.

Option C: "I would be your man." "Would" often indicates the conditional mood, but sometimes it can be part of the subjunctive in reported speech. However, I think "would" here is more indicative of a conditional statement rather than the subjunctive.

Option D: "Your man is where?" This seems like a question using "is," which is present tense. Not subjunctive.

Option E: "Your man, where is he?" Again, a question using present tense. Not subjunctive.

Option F: "Your man might be here." "Might" is a modal verb, and while it can express possibility, it's not necessarily subjunctive. It's more of a conditional or possibility statement.

Option G: "Your man could be here." Similar to F, "could" is a modal verb. Not subjunctive.

Option H: "I am not your man." This is a straightforward statement, so indicative mood.

Option I: "Wherefore art your man?" Wait, "art" is an archaic form of "are." This seems like a Shakespearean way of speaking, but is it subjunctive? I'm not sure. "Wherefore art thou" is a famous line, but it's in the indicative mood, I think. It's more poetic than subjunctive.

Option J: "Where is your man?" Another question, present tense. Not subjunctive.

So, the options that seem to fit the subjunctive are A and B. Let me think again. 

Option A: "If only your man was here." "Was" is past tense, but "if only" is a common structure for the subjunctive. However, sometimes in spoken English, people might use the past tense even when the subjunctive would require the base form. Wait, actually, noâ€” subjunctive after "if only" uses the past tense, so A is correct.

But Option B: "I wish I were your man." This is a clear example of the subjunctive. "Wish" requires the subjunctive, so "were" is correct here, regardless of the subject.

Wait, but the question is asking which sentence is written in the subjunctive. So both A and B could be candidates. Let me double-check.

In modern English, the subjunctive is most commonly found after verbs like "wish," "demand," "suggest," etc., and after expressions like "if only" and "I wish." So both A and B are subjunctive. But looking back at the options, the question is which of these sentences is written in the subjunctive, so perhaps more than one is correct, but the options are from A to J.

Wait, the options are A to J, each a single sentence. So the correct answers are both A and B? But the options are separate, so I need to pick the one that is definitely subjunctive.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me recall: the subjunctive mood in English is used in three main cases: after certain verbs (wish, insist, demand, etc.), after certain expressions (if only, I suggest that, etc.), and in some subordinate clauses, especially those expressing necessity or hypothetical situations.

So, in Option B, "wish" is a verb that triggers the subjunctive. The correct structure after "wish" is the base form, but in this case, it's "were," which is the subjunctive form, even though "I" is the subject. So "I wish I were..." is correct.

In Option A, "If only your man was here." "If only" introduces a hypothetical situation, so the subjunctive is used. But wait, isn't the subjunctive after "if only" the base form? Or is it the past tense? I'm a bit confused here. I think in the case of "if only," the subjunctive uses the past tense for present and future hypotheticals, so "was" is correct. So both A and B are subjunctive.

But the question is asking which of these is written in the subjunctive. It's possible that both A and B are correct, but looking at the options, maybe only one is intended as the correct answer. Let me see the options again.

The options are:

A: If only your man was here

B: I wish I were your man

C: I would be your man

D: Your man is where?

E: Your man, where is he?

F: Your man might be here

G: Your man could be here

H: I am not your man

I: Wherefore art your man?

J: Where is your man?

The question is which is written in the subjunctive. Both A and B are subjunctive, but perhaps the intended answer is B because it's a more clear-cut example. Alternatively, maybe A is correct because "if only" requires the subjunctive. 

Wait, but "if only" is a conditional expression. The structure is "if only + past tense," but sometimes it's used for the present. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me check: the subjunctive after "if only" uses the past tense for present and future situations, so "If only he were here" would be correct, but "If only he was here" is also sometimes used, though perhaps more in spoken English.

Wait, no. Actually, in the subjunctive, after "if only," we use the past tense, which for "be" is "were." So the correct form is "If only your man were here." But the option says "was," which is past indicative. So perhaps A is incorrect because it uses "was" instead of "were." 

Wait, that's a key point. The subjunctive mood for "be" uses "were" regardless of the subject. So in the subjunctive, it should be "were." So in Option A, it's "was," which is past indicative, not subjunctive. Therefore, A is not correct. Only B is correct because it uses "were" after "wish," which is the subjunctive.

So the correct answer is B.

The correct answer is B because it uses "were" after "wish," which is characteristic of the subjunctive mood. 

Answer: B
