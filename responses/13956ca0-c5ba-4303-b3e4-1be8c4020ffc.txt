Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about marketing concepts, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read the question again and think through it step by step.

The question says: "Determining how a product can be useful, identifying the target price, finding a place to sell the product, and deciding how to promote it best exemplifies using..." Then it gives options A through J.

Hmm. Let's break down each part of the question. The first part is determining how a product can be useful. That sounds like understanding the product's value proposition, maybe figuring out who needs it and how it solves their problem. Next, identifying the target price—so that's setting a price point, probably considering what the market will bear and what competitors are charging.

Then, finding a place to sell the product. That would be distribution channels, deciding where to make the product available to the target customers. Like, should it be in stores, online, or both?

Lastly, deciding how to promote it. That's the promotional aspect, maybe广告, social media, sales tactics, etc.

Putting it all together, these steps seem to cover various elements of how a product is brought to market. I remember from my studies that the marketing mix is often referred to as the 4 Ps: Product, Price, Place, Promotion. So each of these tasks corresponds to one of the Ps.

Wait, let me make sure. The marketing mix is about the combination of product, price, place, and promotion that a company uses to bring a product to market. So determining how useful the product is would relate to the product itself—maybe product development. But the question is about the process of determining these factors, not just the product itself.

Looking at the options, option D is "marketing mix." That seems to fit because all four aspects (usefulness, price, place, promotion) are elements of the marketing mix. Let me check the other options to be sure.

Option A: Market research. That's about gathering data, not so much about the actual planning and execution of the product's introduction.

Option B: Positioning. That's about how the product is perceived in the market relative to competitors, which is part of marketing but not the whole process described.

Option C: Product differentiation. That's about making a product stand out, which is part of the product aspect but not the whole picture here.

Option E: Brand equity. That's about the value of the brand name, not directly about the product's introduction steps.

Option F: Market development strategy. That's broader, involving entering new markets, which isn't exactly what's described.

Option G: Market penetration. That's about increasing sales in existing markets, not the initial setup of product, price, etc.

Option H: Segmenting. That's identifying target markets, but again, not the entire process.

Option I: Product lifecycle. That's about the stages a product goes through over time, not the initial planning.

Option J: Competitive analysis. That's about understanding competitors, which is part of the process but not the entire picture.

So yeah, the best fit seems to be D: marketing mix. It covers all four aspects mentioned in the question.

The question involves determining how a product can be useful, identifying its target price, finding a place to sell it, and deciding on the best promotional strategy. These steps correspond to the four elements of the marketing mix: product, price, place, and promotion. Therefore, the correct answer is D: marketing mix.

Answer: D
