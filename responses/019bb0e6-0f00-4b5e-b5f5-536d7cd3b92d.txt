Alright, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

Count Rumford observed that using cannon boring machinery, a single horse could heat 11.6 kg of ice water (initial temperature 273 K) to 355 K in 2.5 hours. Assuming the same rate of work, how high could a horse raise a 225 kg weight in 2.5 minutes? The heat capacity of water is given as 4.18 J K⁻¹ g⁻¹.

The options are from A to J, with various meters.

Okay, so the key here is to find out the work done by the horse in both scenarios and then equate them to find the height. Let's break it down.

First, I'll calculate the energy (work) the horse uses to heat the water. Then, using that power, I'll find out how much work it can do in 2.5 minutes when lifting the weight. From there, I can find the height.

Step 1: Calculate the heat required to raise the temperature of the water.

The formula for heat (Q) is Q = m * c * ΔT.

But wait, m is in kg here, and the heat capacity is given per gram. So I need to convert the mass from kg to grams.

11.6 kg is 11600 grams.

Initial temperature T_initial = 273 K, final T_final = 355 K. So ΔT = 355 - 273 = 82 K.

So Q = 11600 g * 4.18 J/(g·K) * 82 K.

Let me compute that:

First, 11600 * 4.18 = let's see. 10,000 *4.18=41,800. 1,600*4.18= 6,688. So total is 41,800 + 6,688 = 48,488 J/K. Hmm, wait, actually, no, that's not quite right. Because 11600 *4.18 is 11600 *4 =46400 and 11600 *0.18=2088. So 46400 +2088=48,488 J/K. Then multiply by ΔT=82 K.

So 48,488 *82. Let me compute that.

48,488 *80 = 3,879,040
48,488 *2 =96,976
Total Q=3,879,040 +96,976 =3,976,016 J.

So about 3,976,016 Joules of energy.

But wait, actually, let me check the calculation again. Because 11600 *4.18 is 11600 *4.18.

Let me compute 11600 *4 =46,400.

11600 *0.18 = 2,088.

So yes, 46,400 +2,088 =48,488 J/K.

Multiply by 82 K: 48,488 *82.

Let me calculate 48,488 *80 = 3,879,040.

48,488 *2 =96,976.

So total is 3,879,040 +96,976 =3,976,016 J.

So approximately 3,976,016 Joules.

Step 2: Find the power output of the horse.

The time taken is 2.5 hours. Let's convert that to seconds.

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes.

150 minutes *60 seconds/minute=9000 seconds.

So power P = Q / time = 3,976,016 J /9000 s ≈ 441.78 J/s or 441.78 Watts.

Wait, that seems a bit high for a horse, but I remember that horses can exert significant power, so maybe it's plausible.

Step 3: Now, the horse is lifting a 225 kg weight in 2.5 minutes. We need to find the height it can lift.

First, time in seconds: 2.5 minutes *60 =150 seconds.

The work done in lifting is W = m * g * h, where m is mass, g is gravitational acceleration, h is height.

So we have W = 225 kg *9.8 m/s² * h.

But the power is P = W / time.

So W = P * time.

So P is 441.78 W, time is 150 s.

W = 441.78 *150 ≈ 66,267 J.

So 66,267 =225 *9.8 *h.

Let me compute 225*9.8 first.

225 *9.8 = 225*(10-0.2) =2250 -45=2205 N.

So 2205 *h =66,267 J.

Solve for h: h =66,267 /2205 ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

Divide 66,267 by 2205.

First, approximate: 2205 *30=66,150. Because 2205 *30=2205*3*10=6615*10=66,150.

So 66,267 -66,150=117.

So 117 /2205 ≈ 0.053.

So h≈30.053 meters.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A:30 m.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations for any possible mistakes.

Another approach: perhaps I should compute the power more accurately.

Wait, let's recheck the heat calculation.

Q = m c ΔT.

m=11.6 kg=11600 g.

c=4.18 J/g/K.

ΔT=355-273=82 K.

So Q=11600 *4.18 *82.

Compute 11600 *4.18: 11600*4=46400, 11600*0.18=2088. So 46400+2088=48,488.

48,488 *82.

Let me compute 48,488 *80=3,879,040.

48,488 *2=96,976.

Total Q=3,976,016 J.

Yes, that's correct.

Time is 2.5 hours=9000 seconds.

Power P=3,976,016 /9000 ≈ 441.78 J/s.

Now, for the lifting:

Time=2.5 minutes=150 s.

Work W= P *t=441.78 *150=66,267 J.

Mass m=225 kg.

g=9.8 m/s².

Work W= m g h → h= W/(m g)=66,267/(225*9.8).

225 *9.8=2205.

66,267 /2205=30.05 m.

So approximately 30 meters. So option A is 30 m.

But wait, the options include 35 m as option G. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I should check the time calculations again.

Wait, 2.5 hours is indeed 9000 seconds. Correct.

Wait, but perhaps the initial calculation of the heat was wrong. Let me recheck.

Wait, 11600 g *4.18 J/g/K *82 K.

Let me compute 11600 *4.18 = ?

11600 *4 =46,400.

11600 *0.18=2,088.

Total 46,400 +2,088=48,488 J/K.

Multiply by 82: 48,488 *82.

Let me compute 48,488 *80=3,879,040.

48,488 *2=96,976.

Total 3,879,040 +96,976=3,976,016 J. That's correct.

So power is 3,976,016 /9000 ≈441.78 W.

In the second part, time is 2.5 minutes=150 s.

Work W=441.78 *150=66,267 J.

Mass is 225 kg. So m g h=66,267.

h=66,267/(225*9.8)=66,267/2205≈30.05 m.

So the answer should be approximately 30 m. So option A is correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when dealing with work and power, I might have mixed up the formulas. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: Instead of calculating power, maybe I should find the energy per unit time and then see how much energy is available in 2.5 minutes, then compute the height.

Energy in heating: 3,976,016 J in 9000 s.

Energy available in 150 s: (3,976,016 /9000) *150=3,976,016 * (150/9000)=3,976,016*(1/60)=66,266.933... J.

Which is the same as before.

So yes, same result.

So the height is approximately 30 meters. So the answer is A.
</think>

The horse's power is calculated based on the energy required to heat the water and the time taken. Using the same power, the work done in lifting the weight for 2.5 minutes is determined, leading to a height of approximately 30 meters.
