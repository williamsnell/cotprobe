Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it says. Chesa made 32 one-cup servings of soup last year for a school party. This year, she's going to make two times the amount she made last year. The question is asking how many gallons of soup she will make this year. Hmm, okay, so I need to convert cups to gallons.

Wait, right, I remember that 1 gallon is equal to 16 cups. That's a crucial point because the problem is in cups, and the answer needs to be in gallons. So first, I should figure out how many cups she made this year, and then convert that into gallons.

Last year, she made 32 cups. This year, she's making twice that amount. So let's calculate that. Twice of 32 is 32 multiplied by 2. Let me do the math: 32 * 2 equals 64 cups. Got it, so she's making 64 cups this year.

Now, I need to convert 64 cups into gallons. Since 1 gallon is 16 cups, I can divide the total number of cups by 16 to get gallons. So, 64 divided by 16. Let's see, 16 goes into 64 exactly 4 times because 16 times 4 is 64. So that means 64 cups is equal to 4 gallons.

Wait a second, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Last year: 32 cups. This year: double that, so 64 cups. Conversion: 16 cups per gallon. 64 divided by 16 is 4. Yep, that seems right.

Looking at the options provided, let me see which one is 4. The options are A through J, with D being 4. So the correct answer should be D.

Chesa made 32 cups last year and doubled it to 64 cups this year. Since 16 cups equal 1 gallon, 64 cups รท 16 = 4 gallons. 

Answer: D
