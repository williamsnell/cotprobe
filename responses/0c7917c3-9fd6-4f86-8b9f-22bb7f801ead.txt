Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about calculating the work involved when a gas in a 2.0-liter container at 2.4 atmospheres pressure is allowed to expand against an external pressure of 0.80 atmospheres. The options are given from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, work done by the gas during expansion. I remember that when a gas expands against an external pressure, it does work on the surroundings. But wait, the formula for work in such cases is usually W = -P_ext * ΔV, right? Or wait, sometimes it's written as W = -P_ext * (V_final - V_initial). Oh, and the sign convention depends on whether the system is doing work on the surroundings or the other way around.

So first, I need to find the change in volume, ΔV. The initial volume is 2.0 liters. But what's the final volume after expansion? Oh wait, the problem doesn't specify the final volume directly. Hmm, that's confusing. Did I miss something? Oh, wait a minute—maybe I can find the final volume using the ideal gas law, but wait, I don't have the temperature or the number of moles. Maybe that's not the way to go.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem doesn't give the final volume, but maybe it's a case where the expansion is against a constant external pressure, and we're assuming the process is such that the volume changes from the initial to some final state. But without more information, like temperature change or moles, maybe the problem is simpler. Oh, wait, maybe the gas expands until the internal pressure equals the external pressure. Because when a gas expands against a constant external pressure, it's allowed to expand until the internal pressure equals the external pressure. So perhaps the final pressure is 0.80 atm, which is the external pressure.

If that's the case, then I can use the ideal gas law to find the final volume. Since pressure and volume are inversely proportional when temperature and moles are constant. So the initial pressure P1 is 2.4 atm, and the initial volume V1 is 2.0 L. The final pressure P2 is 0.80 atm. Assuming the temperature and number of moles are constant, so P1 * V1 = P2 * V2.

So rearranging, V2 = (P1 * V1) / P2. Plugging in the numbers: V2 = (2.4 atm * 2.0 L) / 0.80 atm. Let's calculate that. 2.4 * 2 = 4.8, and 4.8 / 0.8 is 6. So V2 is 6 liters. So the change in volume ΔV is V2 - V1 = 6 L - 2 L = 4 L. So ΔV is 4 liters.

Now, the work done is W = -P_ext * ΔV. Wait, but which pressure? The external pressure is 0.80 atm. So W = -0.80 atm * 4 L. That gives W = -3.2 L·atm. Wait, but wait—am I using the external pressure correctly? Because when the gas expands, it's pushing against the external pressure, so the work done by the system (the gas) is negative because the system is losing energy. Alternatively, from the surroundings' perspective, work is done on them, so the system's work is negative.

Wait, no, the formula I remember is W = -P_ext * ΔV. So if the gas expands, ΔV is positive, so W is negative. So in this case, ΔV is +4 L, so W = -0.80 atm * 4 L = -3.2 L·atm.

Looking at the options, E is -3.2 L atm. So that should be the answer. 

Wait, but let me think again. Another approach: the formula for work when the gas expands against a constant external pressure is W = -P_ext * (V_final - V_initial). So yes, that's the same as what I did. So yeah, the work done by the gas is -3.2 L·atm. So the correct answer is E.

The work involved when a gas expands against a constant external pressure is calculated using the formula:

\[
W = -P_{\text{ext}} \cdot \Delta V
\]

Here, \( P_{\text{ext}} = 0.80 \, \text{atm} \). The change in volume (\( \Delta V \)) is determined by finding the final volume when the internal pressure equals the external pressure. Using the ideal gas law at constant temperature and moles:

\[
P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2 \implies V_2 = \frac{P_1 V_1}{P_2}
\]

Substituting \( P_1 = 2.4 \, \text{atm} \), \( V_1 = 2.0 \, \text{L} \), and \( P_2 = 0.80 \, \text{atm} \):

\[
V_2 = \frac{2.4 \cdot 2.0}{0.80} = 6.0 \, \text{L}
\]

Thus, \( \Delta V = V_2 - V_1 = 6.0 - 2.0 = 4.0 \, \text{L} \). Substituting into the work formula:

\[
W = -0.80 \cdot 4.0 = -3.2 \, \text{L atm}
\]

The work done by the gas is \(-3.2 \, \text{L atm}\), corresponding to option E.
