Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the determinant of a linear transformation D(f) = f' on the space V spanned by cos(2x) and sin(2x). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the determinant of a linear transformation can be found by looking at the matrix representation of that transformation with respect to a basis. Since V is a two-dimensional space spanned by cos(2x) and sin(2x), I can use these as my basis.

So, the transformation D is the derivative operator. I need to find how D acts on each basis vector and then represent that as a matrix. Let's break it down.

The basis functions are f1(x) = cos(2x) and f2(x) = sin(2x). Applying D to each:

- D(f1) = f1' = derivative of cos(2x) with respect to x. I remember that the derivative of cos(u) is -sin(u) times the derivative of u. So, 2 times that. So, f1' = -2 sin(2x).

- D(f2) = f2' = derivative of sin(2x) with respect to x. Similarly, the derivative of sin(u) is cos(u) times the derivative of u. So, 2 cos(2x). Therefore, f2' = 2 cos(2x).

Now, I need to express these derivatives as linear combinations of the basis functions f1 and f2.

So, D(f1) = -2 sin(2x) = 0 * cos(2x) + (-2) * sin(2x). That means the coefficients for f1 and f2 are 0 and -2, respectively.

Similarly, D(f2) = 2 cos(2x) = 2 * cos(2x) + 0 * sin(2x). So the coefficients here are 2 and 0.

Putting this into a matrix form, where each column represents the coefficients of D(f1) and D(f2) in terms of f1 and f2:

The matrix M would be:
[ 0   2 ]
[-2   0 ]

Wait, no, because the first column is for D(f1), which is 0 for f1 and -2 for f2. So the first column is [0; -2], and the second column is [2; 0]. So the matrix is:

[ 0   2 ]
[-2   0 ]

Wait, no, that's correct. Because when you write the transformation matrix, the first column is the image of the first basis vector, which is D(f1) expressed in terms of f1 and f2. So, D(f1) is 0*f1 + (-2)*f2, so the first column is [0; -2]. Similarly, D(f2) is 2*f1 + 0*f2, so the second column is [2; 0]. So the matrix M is:

| 0   2 |
| -2  0 |

Now, to find the determinant of this matrix. The determinant of a 2x2 matrix [a b; c d] is ad - bc.

So, a=0, b=2, c=-2, d=0.

So determinant = (0)(0) - (2)(-2) = 0 + 4 = 4.

Wait, that's 4, so looking at the options, H is 4. So the answer should be H.

Alternatively, just to double-check, maybe I made a mistake in the matrix setup. Let me think again. The columns are the images of the basis vectors.

So, when I apply D to f1, I get -2 sin(2x) which is 0*f1 + (-2)*f2, so the first column is [0; -2].

When I apply D to f2, I get 2 cos(2x), which is 2*f1 + 0*f2, so the second column is [2; 0].

So the matrix is indeed:

[0  2]
[-2 0]

Calculating determinant: (0*0) - (2*(-2)) = 0 +4 =4. Yep, that's correct.

The determinant of the matrix representation of the derivative operator is 4.

Answer: H
