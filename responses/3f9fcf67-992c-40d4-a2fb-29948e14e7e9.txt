Question:

In the NoNicks operating system, the time required by a single file-read operation has four nonoverlapping components:
disk seek time-25 msec
disk latency time-8 msec
disk transfer time- 1 msec per 1,000 bytes
operating system overhead-1 msec per 1,000 bytes + 10 msec
In version 1 of the system, the file read retrieved blocks of 1,000 bytes. In version 2, the file read (along with the underlying layout on disk) was modified to retrieve blocks of 4,000 bytes. The ratio of-the time required to read a large file under version 2 to the time required to read the same large file under version 1 is approximately

Okay, so I've got this question about the NoNicks operating system and how the time to read a file changes between two versions. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to break it down step by step.

First, let me read the question carefully. The system has four components contributing to the time for a single file-read operation: disk seek time, disk latency time, disk transfer time, and operating system overhead. Each of these is given with specific values.

The components are:

1. Disk seek time: 25 msec
2. Disk latency time: 8 msec
3. Disk transfer time: 1 msec per 1,000 bytes
4. Operating system overhead: 1 msec per 1,000 bytes + 10 msec

In version 1, the file read retrieves blocks of 1,000 bytes. In version 2, they changed to 4,000 bytes per block. The question is asking for the ratio of the time required to read a large file under version 2 to version 1. So, we need to compute the time for both versions and then find the ratio.

Let me think about how each component contributes to the total time.

I think the disk seek time and latency time are fixed per read operation, regardless of the block size. So, each time the system reads a block, it has to seek and wait for the disk to be ready, which is 25 + 8 = 33 msec per read.

Then, the transfer time and OS overhead depend on the number of bytes being transferred. For version 1, each block is 1,000 bytes, and for version 2, it's 4,000 bytes. But since a large file is being read, the number of blocks would be different.

Wait, but wait—what's the total size of the file? Since it's a large file, maybe we can assume it's much larger than a single block, so the number of blocks will be the same relative to the block size. Alternatively, perhaps each read operation is a single block, so for a large file, the number of blocks is large, but we can model per-block time and then multiply by the number of blocks.

Let me clarify: for a large file, the number of blocks is proportional to the file size divided by the block size. So, if the file size is S bytes, version 1 would have S/1000 blocks, and version 2 would have S/4000 blocks. But for the same file S, the number of blocks in version 2 is a quarter of version 1. So, the total time would be (time per block) multiplied by the number of blocks.

Wait, no. Let me think again. For a large file, each read operation is a block. So, for version 1, each read is 1,000 bytes, so for a file of size N * 1000 bytes, the number of read operations is N. Similarly, version 2 reads 4,000 bytes per read, so the number of read operations is N/4, assuming the file size is 4,000 * N bytes. Wait, but the same file would have the same size, so if version 1 reads 1,000 bytes per block, the number of blocks is S/1000. For version 2, it's S/4000. So, the number of blocks in version 2 is (S/4000) = (S/1000) * (1/4). So, version 2 has a quarter of the number of read operations compared to version 1 for the same file.

So, the total time for version 1 would be (time per block) * (number of blocks). Similarly for version 2.

Let me compute the time per block for each version.

In version 1:

Each block is 1,000 bytes.

Time components per block:

- Disk seek: 25 msec
- Disk latency: 8 msec
- Transfer time: 1 msec per 1,000 bytes → 1 * 1 = 1 msec
- OS overhead: 1 msec per 1,000 bytes + 10 msec → 1 *1 =1 +10=11 msec.

So, per block time for version 1: 25 + 8 + 1 + 11 = 45 msec per block.

Wait, that's per 1,000 bytes. So per block of 1,000 bytes, the time is 45 msec.

In version 2, each block is 4,000 bytes.

So, the components:

- Disk seek: 25 msec
- Disk latency: 8 msec
- Transfer time: 1 msec per 1,000 bytes → 4,000 bytes is 4 * 1 = 4 msec.
- OS overhead: 1 msec per 1,000 bytes → 4,000 bytes is 4 *1=4, plus 10 msec. So 4 +10=14 msec.

So, per block time for version 2: 25 +8 +4 +14 = 51 msec per block.

Wait, but wait—number of blocks in version 2 is S/4000, while in version 1 it's S/1000, which is four times as many blocks. So, for the same file size S, version 1 has four times as many read operations as version 2.

So, the total time for version 1 is (number of blocks) * time per block.

Number of blocks for version 1: S/1000.

So, total time for version 1: (S/1000) * 45 = 45 * (S/1000) msec.

Total time for version 2: (S/4000) *51 = (51/4) * (S/1000) =12.75 * (S/1000) msec.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if version 2 is faster per block but reads fewer blocks, the total time should be less than version 1. Let me compute the ratio: version 2 time / version 1 time.

Version 2 time: (S/4000)*51.

Version 1 time: (S/1000)*45.

So, ratio = [(S/4000)*51] / [(S/1000)*45] = (51/4) /45 = (51)/(4*45) = 51/(180)= 0.283333...

Which is approximately 0.283, so the ratio is approximately 0.283:1, which is the same as 1:3.529. But wait, the question is the ratio of version 2 time to version 1 time. So, it's 0.283, which is about 1:3.529. Looking at the options, E is 1:3.5, which is close.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model it per block. For a single block, version 1's time is 45 msec, and version 2's per block is 51 msec, but version 2's per block is 4 times larger. So, for the same number of blocks, version 2 would take longer, but since they read fewer blocks, the total time could be less.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of per-byte time or per-block time, but considering the number of blocks.

Let me try a different approach. Let's assume the file is S bytes. For version 1, each read is 1KB, so number of reads = S / 1000.

For version 2, each read is 4KB, so number of reads = S /4000.

Time for version 1:

Each read: 25 +8 +1 +11 =45 msec. So total time = (S/1000) *45.

Time for version 2:

Each read:25 +8 +4 +14=51 msec. So total time = (S/4000)*51.

So, version 2 time = (51/4000) * S.

Version 1 time = (45/1000)* S.

So, ratio = [(51/4000) * S] / [(45/1000)* S] = (51/4000) / (45/1000) = (51/4000) * (1000/45) = (51 * 1000) / (4000 *45) = (51 *1)/(4*45) = 51/(180) ≈0.2833, which is about 0.2833, so the ratio is approximately 0.2833:1, which is the same as 1:3.529.

Looking at the options, option E is 1:3.5, which is very close. So the ratio is approximately 1:3.5, meaning version 2 is about 3.5 times faster than version 1.

Wait, but wait. The question asks for the ratio of the time required under version 2 to version 1. So, if version 2 time is 0.2833 times version 1 time, the ratio is 0.2833:1, which is equivalent to 1:3.529. So, the ratio is approximately 1:3.5, which is option E.

Another way to think about it: for version 1, each block takes 45 msec. Version 2's block is 4 times larger, but the time per block is 51 msec, which is 1.133 times longer than version 1's per-block time. But since each version 2 block covers 4 times as much data, the number of blocks is a quarter. So, the time per byte in version 2 would be (51 msec per 4000 bytes) → 51/4000 = 0.01275 msec/byte. In version 1, it's 45/1000 = 0.045 msec/byte. Wait, no, that can't be right because version 2 should be faster. Wait, 51/4000 is 0.01275, which is less than 0.045, so version 2 is faster per byte. But when considering the total time for the same file, we have to multiply by the number of bytes.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the time per byte for each version.

Version 1: per block is 45 msec for 1000 bytes → 45/1000 = 0.045 msec per byte.

Version 2: per block is 51 msec for 4000 bytes → 51/4000 = 0.01275 msec per byte.

So, the time per byte is lower in version 2, which makes sense. But how does this affect the total time for the same file? Let's say the file is S bytes.

Time for version 1: 0.045 * S.

Time for version 2: 0.01275 * S.

Wait, that would mean version 2 is much faster. But according to this, the ratio would be (0.01275 S) / (0.045 S) = 0.2833, which is the same as before. So the ratio is 1:3.5.

Therefore, the correct answer should be E: 1:3.5.

The time required to read a large file under version 2 compared to version 1 is approximately 1:3.5.
