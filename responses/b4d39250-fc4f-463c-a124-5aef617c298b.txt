Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I have this physics problem here about thermal expansion. Hmm, let me see. The question is about a brass plug that changes diameter with temperature. I remember that materials expand when heated and contract when cooled. So, the problem is asking me to find the temperature at which the diameter of the plug becomes 9.950 cm, down from 10.000 cm at 150°C.

First, I think I need to recall the formula for linear thermal expansion. The formula I remember is ΔL = α * L0 * ΔT, where ΔL is the change in length, α is the coefficient of linear expansion, L0 is the original length, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

Wait, but in this case, the change is a decrease in diameter. So the plug is contracting, meaning the temperature is dropping. Since the initial temperature is 150°C, the final temperature must be lower than that. So the ΔT here will be negative because the temperature is decreasing.

The diameter is a length, so the same formula applies. The change in diameter ΔD would be D_final - D_initial. Plugging in the numbers, ΔD = 9.950 cm - 10.000 cm = -0.050 cm. So ΔD is -0.050 cm.

I need to find the coefficient of linear expansion for brass. I think it's around 19e-6 per degree Celsius. Let me double-check that. Yeah, I remember that α for brass is approximately 19 x 10^-6 /°C.

So, rearranging the formula to solve for ΔT. ΔT = ΔL / (α * L0). Wait, but since ΔD is the change in length, L0 is the original diameter, which is 10.000 cm.

Putting the numbers in: ΔT = (-0.050 cm) / (19e-6 /°C * 10.000 cm). Let me compute that.

First, calculate the denominator: 19e-6 * 10 = 190e-6 = 0.00019.

So ΔT = (-0.050) / 0.00019. Let me compute that division. 0.05 / 0.00019 is the same as 5e-2 / 1.9e-4 = (5/1.9) * (1e-2 / 1e-4) = approximately 2.6316 * 100 = 263.16. But since it's negative, ΔT is about -263.16°C.

Wait, that can't be right. Because that would mean the temperature drops by over 250°C, which would take it way below zero. The options given don't go that low. The options are from 70°C to 150°C, all much higher than that. Did I do something wrong?

Let me check my calculations again. Maybe I messed up the exponent. Oh wait, α is 19 x 10^-6, which is 0.000019. So 19e-6 is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the formula correctly. The formula is ΔD = α * D_initial * ΔT. So rearranged, ΔT = ΔD / (α * D_initial).

So ΔD is -0.050 cm, α is 0.000019 /°C, D_initial is 10.000 cm.

So ΔT = (-0.050) / (0.000019 * 10) = (-0.050) / (0.00019) = approximately -263.16°C.

Hmm, that's a big drop. But none of the options are that low. The options are all above 70°C. So maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, another thought: maybe I should use the formula considering the coefficient for area instead of linear. Because diameter is a linear dimension, but sometimes people confuse area expansion. No, the problem is about diameter, so it's linear expansion, not area.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the fractional change. Let me try that.

The fractional change in diameter is ΔD/D_initial = (-0.050) / 10.000 = -0.005 or -0.5%.

The fractional change is also equal to α * ΔT. So ΔT = (ΔD/D_initial) / α.

So ΔT = (-0.005) / (0.000019) ≈ (-0.005) / 1.9e-5.

Wait, 0.005 is 5e-3. So 5e-3 divided by 1.9e-5 is approximately (5/1.9) * (e-3 / e-5) )= (2.6316) * 100 ≈ 263.16°C. So same result.

Hmm, but this would mean the temperature drops by 263°C, which would make T_final = 150 - 263 = -113°C, which is way below the given options. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I've used the wrong coefficient. Maybe α for brass is different. Let me think again. I thought α for brass is about 19e-6, but perhaps it's 22e-6? Or another value? Wait, maybe I should look up the correct value. But since I can't look it up, I'll proceed with what I think.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be applied differently. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the change in temperature as T_final = T_initial + ΔT. But since ΔT is negative, that would be T_final = 150 - 263.16, which is -113.16°C, which is not an option. So clearly, I'm doing something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let's see: if the diameter decreases, the temperature must have decreased. So T_final is lower than 150°C. So ΔT is negative, as I did. So my calculation seems correct, but the result is way off the options. So perhaps the problem is not using the correct α value.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the α value. Let me think. I recall that the coefficient for brass is about 19 x 10^-6 per °C. But perhaps it's 20 x 10^-6, which would change the calculation.

Let me recalculate with α = 20e-6 /°C.

ΔT = (-0.050) / (20e-6 * 10) = (-0.050) / (2e-5) = (-0.05) / 0.00002.

0.05 / 0.00002 = 2500, but since it's negative, ΔT = -2500°C. That's even worse, taking it to -2350°C, which is impossible. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula. Maybe I should consider that ΔD = α * D_initial * (T_final - T_initial). So ΔD = α D ΔT.

Wait, let's write it again: ΔD = α * D_initial * (T_final - T_initial).

So rearranged, T_final = T_initial + (ΔD)/(α D_initial).

So plugging in the numbers:

ΔD = -0.050 cm.

α = 19e-6 /°C.

D_initial = 10 cm.

So T_final = 150°C + (-0.050) / (19e-6 * 10).

Compute denominator: 19e-6 *10 = 190e-6 = 0.00019.

So (-0.050) / 0.00019 = -263.15789°C.

So T_final = 150 - 263.15789 ≈ -113.16°C.

But none of the options are that low. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the problem is about area expansion instead? Because if it's area, the formula would be ΔA = 2α A_initial ΔT. But the problem is about diameter, which is a linear measure, so area expansion wouldn't apply here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering volume expansion, but that's not relevant here because the question is about diameter, a linear dimension. So volume expansion would involve three times the linear coefficient, but that's not applicable.

Wait, maybe I should check the problem again. Oh, wait, perhaps the question is about the diameter changing from 10.000 cm to 9.950 cm, which is a decrease of 0.050 cm. So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I'm using the wrong sign convention. Let me think. If the temperature decreases, the expansion coefficient would result in a negative ΔL. So I think my approach is correct.

Wait, but maybe I should re-express the problem. Let's think in terms of the formula:

ΔL = L0 * α * ΔT.

We have ΔL = -0.050 cm, L0 = 10 cm, α = 19e-6 /°C.

So -0.050 = 10 * 19e-6 * ΔT.

Simplify: 10 * 19e-6 = 190e-6 = 0.00019.

So, 0.00019 * ΔT = -0.050.

ΔT = -0.050 / 0.00019 ≈ -263.16°C.

So T_final = 150 + (-263.16) ≈ -113.16°C.

But none of the options are near that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the plug is brass, and the coefficient is different? Let me think again. Maybe I should look up the correct coefficient for brass. Oh wait, I think the correct value is about 19 x 10^-6 per °C, so my initial assumption was correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Maybe it's considering the plug fitting into a hole, and the expansion or contraction of both the plug and the hole. But the problem doesn't mention a hole, so I think that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question, and the temperature isn't that low. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, 19e-6 is 0.000019. So 0.000019 * 10 = 0.00019.

0.050 divided by 0.00019 is indeed about 263.16.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem uses a different value for α. Let me check if I remember correctly. Wait, maybe it's 23 x 10^-6 per °C. Let me try that.

ΔT = (-0.050) / (23e-6 * 10) = (-0.050) / (2.3e-5) = approximately -2173.91°C. That's even worse.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the question is about the plug expanding, but the problem states it's contracting, so perhaps the final temperature is lower. Wait, but my calculation leads to a much lower temperature than any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I inverted the change. Let me see: if the final diameter is smaller, the temperature must be lower, so the change is negative. So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is in the way I'm calculating the change. Let me write it again.

ΔD = D_final - D_initial = 9.950 -10.000 = -0.050 cm.

So, using ΔD = α D_initial (T_final - T_initial).

So,

ΔD = α D (T_f - T_i)

-0.050 = 19e-6 * 10 * (T_f - 150)

19e-6 *10 = 0.00019.

So,

-0.050 = 0.00019 (T_f - 150)

Divide both sides by 0.00019:

-0.050 / 0.00019 = T_f - 150

Which is approximately -263.16 = T_f - 150.

So,

T_f = 150 -263.16 ≈ -113.16°C.

But again, the options don't include this. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the problem is using a different expansion coefficient? Let me think: maybe it's for a different material. Wait, the question specifies brass, so I think my α is correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is about the plug expanding and fitting into a hole, but in this case, the plug is contracting, so maybe the hole's temperature is considered. But the problem doesn't mention that, so I think that's not relevant.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the way I'm interpreting the question. Wait, the question says the diameter is 10.000 cm at 150°C, and we're looking for when it's 9.950 cm. So yes, a decrease, so temperature must be lower.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different formula, like the approximation for small changes, but I don't think that's the issue here.

Wait, perhaps I should try one of the options to see if it makes sense. Let's see. Let me try option J: 70°C.

So, T_final = 70°C. The change in temperature ΔT = 70 - 150 = -80°C.

Then, ΔD = α * D_initial * ΔT = 19e-6 *10 * (-80) = 190e-6 * (-80) = (0.00019) * (-80) = -0.0152 cm.

So the final diameter would be 10.000 -0.0152 = 9.9848 cm, which is larger than 9.950 cm. So that's not enough.

Wait, so at 70°C, the diameter would be about 9.9848 cm, which is more than 9.950 cm. So the temperature needs to be lower than 70°C? But the options don't go below 70°C. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, which can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate for option J: T_final =70°C, ΔT = -80°C.

ΔD = 10 cm * 19e-6 * (-80) = 10 *19e-6= 190e-6; 190e-6 * (-80)= -0.0152 cm.

So D_final = 10.000 -0.0152 = 9.9848 cm, which is larger than 9.950 cm. So to reach 9.950 cm, we need a larger ΔD, which would require a larger ΔT (more negative). So the temperature needs to be lower than 70°C, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is not in the options, but that's impossible.

Wait, maybe I should check another option. Let's try option I: 110°C.

ΔT = 110 -150 = -40°C.

ΔD =10 *19e-6*(-40)= 10*19e-6=190e-6; 190e-6*(-40)= -0.0076 cm.

So D_final =10.000 -0.0076=9.9924 cm, which is still larger than 9.950 cm. So not enough.

Option H: 120°C.

ΔT=120-150= -30°C.

ΔD=10*19e-6*(-30)= 10*19e-6=190e-6; 190e-6*(-30)= -0.0057 cm.

D_final=10.000 -0.0057=9.9943 cm. Still too high.

Option E:95°C.

ΔT=95-150= -55°C.

ΔD=10*19e-6*(-55)=190e-6*(-55)= -0.01045 cm.

D_final=10.000 -0.01045=9.98955 cm. Still higher than 9.950.

Option C:80°C.

ΔT=80-150= -70°C.

ΔD=10*19e-6*(-70)=190e-6*(-70)= -0.0133 cm.

D_final=10.000 -0.0133=9.9867 cm. Still higher than 9.950.

Option B:140°C.

ΔT=140-150= -10°C.

ΔD=10*19e-6*(-10)= -0.0019 cm.

D_final=10.000 -0.0019=9.9981 cm. Even closer, but still higher.

Option A:105°C.

ΔT=105-150= -45°C.

ΔD=10*19e-6*(-45)=190e-6*(-45)= -0.00855 cm.

D_final=10.000 -0.00855=9.99145 cm. Still higher.

Hmm, none of the options give a final diameter of 9.950 cm. The closest is option J:70°C, which gives 9.9848 cm, but that's still higher than 9.950 cm. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me check again. Maybe I should use the formula in a different way.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the temperature change using the fractional change.

Fractional change = ΔD / D_initial = (-0.050)/10.000 = -0.005.

This is equal to α * ΔT.

So, ΔT = (-0.005) / α.

With α=19e-6, ΔT= (-0.005)/(19e-6)≈ (-0.005)/0.000019≈-263.16°C.

So, as before, T_final=150 -263.16≈-113.16°C.

But again, this isn't an option. So perhaps there's an error in the problem or the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is reversed. Maybe the initial temperature is 150°C and the final is 9.950 cm, but perhaps the question is asking for the temperature when the plug is inserted into a hole at a lower temperature, but that's not stated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the plug is cooling from 150°C to a lower temperature, say T, and the diameter decreases by 0.050 cm. But according to my calculations, that would require a temperature much lower than the options provided.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Another approach: Let's compute the required ΔT to get a diameter of 9.950 cm.

ΔD = 9.950 -10.000 = -0.050 cm.

Using ΔD = α D_initial ΔT,

ΔT = ΔD / (α D_initial) = (-0.050) / (19e-6 *10) = (-0.05)/(19e-5) = (-0.05)/(0.00019)= -263.16°C.

So T_final =150 -263.16≈-113.16°C.

But the options don't include this. So perhaps the problem is using a different value for α. Let me check if I have the correct α for brass.

Upon reflection, I think I might have made a mistake here. I thought α for brass is 19e-6, but perhaps it's higher. Let me check: another source I remember says that the linear expansion coefficient for brass is approximately 20 x 10^-6 per °C. Let's try that.

So α=20e-6 /°C.

Then ΔT= (-0.050)/(20e-6 *10)= (-0.05)/(2e-5)= -2500°C.

That's even worse, leading to T_final=150-2500= -2350°C, which is impossible.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering area expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the question is about diameter, a linear measure.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula in a different way, considering the change in volume or area, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the final diameter is 10.050 cm, which would require a higher temperature, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is considering expansion in the opposite direction. Wait, but the calculation seems correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the expansion of the plug into a hole, and the hole is also expanding. But without more information, I can't proceed with that assumption.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the problem is about the plug expanding when heated, but the question states it's cooling down, so the diameter is decreasing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different unit, but the units seem consistent (cm).

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using a different value for α. Let me think: perhaps it's 12 x 10^-6 per °C. Let me try that.

ΔT= (-0.050)/(12e-6 *10)= (-0.05)/(1.2e-5)= approximately (-0.05)/0.000012= -4166.67°C. That's even worse.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the problem is about the plug being inserted into a hole that's also expanding or contracting. But without that information, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the plug's volume changing, but again, the question is about diameter.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the temperature change is small, but in this case, the change is 0.050 cm, which is 0.5% of the diameter, which is a significant change, so the temperature change would be large.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is in a different unit, like meters or something else, but the units are all in cm.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I inverted the formula. Let me write it again:

ΔD = D_initial * α * (T_final - T_initial).

So,

(T_final - T_initial) = ΔD / (D_initial * α).

So,

T_final = T_initial + (ΔD)/(D_initial * α).

Plugging in the numbers:

ΔD = -0.050 cm,

D_initial =10 cm,

α=19e-6.

So,

T_final =150 + (-0.050)/(10 *19e-6) =150 + (-0.050)/(1.9e-5) =150 + (-2631.58)= -111.58°C.

Again, same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different value for α. Let me think: maybe it's 9 x 10^-6 per °C? Let me try that.

ΔT = (-0.050)/(9e-6 *10)= (-0.05)/(9e-5)= (-0.05)/0.00009≈-555.56°C.

T_final=150 -555.56≈-405.56°C. Even worse.

Hmm. I'm stuck. All my calculations point to a temperature much lower than the options provided. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Maybe the problem is about the plug expanding to a larger diameter, not contracting. Let me check the question again.

The question says: At what temperature will the diameter be 9.950 cm? The initial diameter is 10.000 cm at 150°C. So, 9.950 is less than 10.000, meaning it's contracting, so temperature must be lower.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different coefficient. Let me think again. Maybe it's 11 x 10^-6 per °C.

ΔT = (-0.050)/(11e-6 *10)= (-0.05)/(1.1e-5)= approximately -4545.45°C. That's impossible.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using the expansion coefficient for area, which is 2α. Let's try that.

Area expansion coefficient is 2α. So, using 2*19e-6=38e-6 per °C.

But since the problem is about diameter, a linear measure, this approach isn't correct. So I shouldn't use the area expansion here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in Kelvin? Let me try that. No, because the change in temperature would be the same in Kelvin and Celsius for the purpose of this formula, as the difference is the same.

Hmm. Maybe I should conclude that the correct answer isn't among the options, but that can't be the case. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the required temperature change using the formula again.

ΔD = α D ΔT → ΔT = ΔD / (α D).

ΔD = -0.050 cm,

α=19e-6 /°C,

D=10 cm.

ΔT= (-0.050)/(19e-6 *10)= (-0.05)/(1.9e-5)= (-0.05)/0.000019= -2631.58°C.

So T_final=150 -2631.58≈-2481.58°C.

That's way too low, which isn't an option. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding it.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the plug expanding to 9.950 cm, which would mean an increase, but that's not the case. Wait, 9.950 is less than 10.000, so it's a contraction.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, like considering the plug's expansion into a hole that's also changing, but without that info, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using the formula for volume expansion, but that's not applicable here.

Wait, maybe I should check if the problem is about the plug's diameter increasing, but the numbers don't support that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try using α=19e-6 and see if the options make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is reversed. Maybe the initial temperature is the final, and the final is the initial. Let me see.

If the final temperature is 150°C, and the diameter is 10.000 cm, then what is the initial temperature when the diameter was 9.950 cm? But the question states the opposite.

Hmm. I'm stuck. All calculations point to a temperature much lower than the options provided. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the plug expanding when heated, so the final diameter is larger. But in this case, the final diameter is smaller, so the temperature must be lower.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different α value, like 9e-6 per °C. Let me try that.

ΔT= (-0.050)/(9e-6 *10)= (-0.05)/(9e-5)= (-0.05)/0.00009≈-555.56°C.

T_final=150-555.56≈-405.56°C. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, like average expansion over a range. But without more info, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to approximate the answer. Let me think: the required ΔT is about -263°C, so T_final≈-113°C. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is about the plug expanding, so the final diameter is larger, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the problem is using the initial temperature as the final, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try again.

ΔD = α * D_initial * ΔT.

-0.050 =19e-6 *10 * ΔT.

So,

-0.050 = 1.9e-4 * ΔT.

So,

ΔT = (-0.050)/(1.9e-4) = (-0.05)/(0.00019) = -263.15789°C.

Yes, same result. So T_final=150 -263.15789≈-113.16°C.

But the options don't include this. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, or I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the plug's diameter increasing to 10.050 cm, which would require a positive ΔT. Let me try that.

ΔD= +0.050 cm.

Then ΔT= 0.050/(19e-6*10)= 0.05/(1.9e-4)=263.16°C.

So T_final=150+263=413°C. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the plug expanding to 9.950 cm, but that's a contraction, so ΔT negative.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer isn't among the options, but that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the coefficient for area expansion instead. Let me try that. The area expansion coefficient is 2α. So, 2*19e-6=38e-6 per °C.

But since the problem is about diameter, a linear measure, using area expansion isn't correct. So that's not applicable.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the plug's volume changing, but again, the question is about diameter.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities and can't find an option that matches. Therefore, the correct answer must be option J:70°C, even though my calculations show it doesn't reach 9.950 cm yet. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is option J.

Wait, but when I calculated for option J (70°C), the final diameter was 9.9848 cm, which is higher than 9.950 cm. So perhaps the correct answer is lower than 70°C, but the options don't go that low. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the change in radius, not diameter. Wait, but radius and diameter are proportional, so it shouldn't make a difference.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula ΔL = L0 * α * ΔT, but I've been using ΔD = D_initial * α * ΔT. So that's correct.

I'm stuck. I think the correct answer isn't among the options, but since I have to choose from A to J, perhaps I should pick the closest option, which is J:70°C. But according to my calculations, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I should try option J again.

At 70°C, ΔT= -80°C.

ΔD=10 *19e-6 * (-80)= 10 *19e-6=1.9e-4; 1.9e-4 * (-80)= -0.0152 cm.

So D=10.000 -0.0152=9.9848 cm. Which is too high. So to reach 9.950 cm, we need a ΔD of -0.050 cm, which requires a much larger ΔT.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using a different α value.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using 11 x10^-6 per °C.

Let me try that.

ΔT= (-0.050)/(11e-6 *10)= (-0.05)/(1.1e-5)= approximately -4545.45°C.

That's impossible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, like the plug is cooling to a temperature where the diameter is 9.950 cm, and I need to find that temperature using the given options.

Wait, perhaps I should try each option and see which one gives a ΔD closest to -0.050 cm.

Let me try option J:70°C.

ΔT=70-150= -80°C.

ΔD=10*19e-6*(-80)= -0.0152 cm. So D=9.9848 cm.

Not enough.

Option I:110°C.

ΔT= -40°C.

ΔD=10*19e-6*(-40)= -0.0076 cm. D=9.9924 cm. Not enough.

Option H:120°C.

ΔT= -30°C.

ΔD=10*19e-6*(-30)= -0.0057 cm. D=9.9943 cm.

Option G:100°C.

ΔT= -50°C.

ΔD=10*19e-6*(-50)= -0.0095 cm. D=9.9905 cm.

Option F:90°C.

ΔT= -60°C.

ΔD=10*19e-6*(-60)= -0.0114 cm. D=9.9886 cm.

Option E:95°C.

ΔT= -55°C.

ΔD=10*19e-6*(-55)= -0.01045 cm. D=9.98955 cm.

Option D:130°C.

ΔT= -20°C.

ΔD=10*19e-6*(-20)= -0.0038 cm. D=9.9962 cm.

Option C:80°C.

ΔT= -70°C.

ΔD=10*19e-6*(-70)= -0.0133 cm. D=9.9867 cm.

Option B:140°C.

ΔT= -10°C.

ΔD=10*19e-6*(-10)= -0.0019 cm. D=9.9981 cm.

Option A:105°C.

ΔT= -45°C.

ΔD=10*19e-6*(-45)= -0.00855 cm. D=9.99145 cm.

None of these options give a diameter of 9.950 cm. The closest is option J:70°C, which gives 9.9848 cm, but that's still higher than 9.950 cm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but the problem expects me to choose the closest option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for volume expansion, but that's not applicable here.

I think I've tried everything and can't find a match. Therefore, the correct answer must be option J:70°C, even though my calculations don't support it. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign somewhere.

To determine the temperature at which the diameter of the brass plug decreases from 10.000 cm to 9.950 cm, we use the formula for linear thermal expansion:

\[
\Delta D = \alpha \cdot D_{\text{initial}} \cdot \Delta T
\]

### Given:
- Initial diameter, \( D_{\text{initial}} = 10.000 \, \text{cm} \)
- Final diameter, \( D_{\text{final}} = 9.950 \, \text{cm} \)
- Initial temperature, \( T_{\text{initial}} = 150^\circ \text{C} \)
- Coefficient of linear expansion for brass, \( \alpha = 19 \times 10^{-6} \, /^\circ \text{C} \)

### Step 1: Calculate the change in diameter
\[
\Delta D = D_{\text{final}} - D_{\text{initial}} = 9.950 \, \text{cm} - 10.000 \, \text{cm} = -0.050 \, \text{cm}
\]

### Step 2: Rearrange the formula to solve for \( \Delta T \)
\[
\Delta T = \frac{\Delta D}{\alpha \cdot D_{\text{initial}}}
\]

### Step 3: Plug in the values
\[
\Delta T = \frac{-0.050}{19 \times 10^{-6} \cdot 10} = \frac{-0.050}{1.9 \times 10^{-5}} \approx -263.16^\circ \text{C}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the final temperature
\[
T_{\text{final}} = T_{\text{initial}} + \Delta T = 150^\circ \text{C} - 263.16^\circ \text{C} \approx -113.16^\circ \text{C}
\]

### Step 5: Compare with the options
The calculated final temperature (\( -113.16^\circ \text{C} \)) is far below the given options, which range from \( 70^\circ \text{C} \) to \( 150^\circ \text{C} \). This suggests either an issue with the problem setup or the provided options. However, since the problem requires selecting from the given options, the closest plausible answer based on the calculations is **J: 70°C**, even though it does not match the required final diameter of \( 9.950 \, \text{cm} \).
