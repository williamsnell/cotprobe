Okay, so I have this question about what enzyme in saliva acts upon a certain nutrient. Let me think through this. I remember that the digestive system starts with the mouth, and saliva plays a role there. The main enzyme in saliva is called amylase, right? Amylase is an enzyme that breaks down carbohydrates. Wait, so what kind of nutrients are we talking about here?

Looking at the options, B is starches, C is sugars, G is carbohydrates. Starches are a type of carbohydrate, so maybe the answer is B. But wait, amylase doesn't just break down starches; it's more general for carbohydrates. So maybe the answer is G, carbohydrates. But let me make sure.

Amylase's job is to start breaking down starch into smaller sugars like maltose. So in the mouth, when you chew food, the saliva mixes with the food, and the amylase begins digesting the starches into simpler sugars. That process continues in the small intestine with other enzymes, but the initial step is in the mouth.

So the question is asking which nutrient the enzyme in saliva acts upon. Since amylase works on carbohydrates, which include starches, the options B and G are both related. But the question is about the specific nutrient. Let me think: the options are 'starches' as B and 'carbohydrates' as G. Since amylase specifically targets starches (which are a subset of carbohydrates), the answer might be B. But wait, sometimes the broader category is considered. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the broader category of carbohydrates, so G would be the answer. But I'm not sure. I think the enzyme amylase is more specifically known for breaking down starches, which are a type of carbohydrate. So the enzyme acts upon starches, which is option B. But wait, another thought: in the mouth, the enzyme doesn't completely break down all carbohydrates, just starts on starches. So the primary action is on starches. Therefore, the answer is B.

The enzyme in saliva, amylase, primarily acts upon starches, which are a type of carbohydrate. Therefore, the correct answer is B.

Answer: B
