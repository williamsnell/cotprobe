Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about the probability that each of their children will be affected if both parents have the same autosomal recessive disorder. Hmm, I remember autosomal means it's not on the sex chromosomes, so it's passed through either parent. And recessive disorders mean both copies of the gene need to be defective to show the disorder.

Wait, both parents are affected. So each parent has the disorder. Since it's recessive, each must have two copies of the recessive allele. For example, if the disease allele is 'a', then each parent's genotype is 'aa'. Because recessive means you need two copies to show the trait.

So, when both parents are 'aa', what are the possible children? Let me think about a Punnett square. Each parent can only give an 'a' allele because they don't have any other alleles. So the square would be:

Parent 1: a
Parent 2: a

So the possible combinations for the child are aa. Because each parent can only contribute an 'a'. So every child would get an 'a' from each parent. That means all their children would be affected.

Wait, so the probability for each child is 100%? Because all four squares in the Punnett square are 'aa'. So that's four children, all affected. So the probability is 4 in 4, which is 1.

Looking at the options, option F is 1, and option H is 4 in 4. Wait, 4 in 4 is the same as 1, so both F and H are the same. But looking at the options, H is 4 in 4 which is 100%, same as F. So the correct answer should be either F or H.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes options might have different ways of expressing the same thing. The question is asking for the probability that each child will be affected. So each child has a 100% chance, so the probability is 1. So option F is 1, which is correct. Option H is 4/4 which is also 1, but looking at the options, sometimes they might list it as 1 in 1, but the given options don't have that. So F is 1, which is correct.

Wait, the options are A: 3/4, B:1/3, C:2/3, D:2/4, E:1/10, F:1, G:3/3, H:4/4, I:1/4, J:1/2.

So both F and H are 1. But typically, probabilities are expressed in fractions like 1/1 or 2/2, but 3/3 is also 1. So why are F and H both present? Maybe a mistake in the options. But I think the intended answer is F:1.

Alternatively, maybe the question is phrased differently, but no, both parents are affected, so they must be homozygous recessive. So every child will definitely get the disorder. So the probability is 100%, which is 1, so option F.

If both parents are affected with the same autosomal recessive disorder, their genotypes must be homozygous recessive (e.g., 'aa'). Using a Punnett square, all offspring will inherit one 'a' allele from each parent, resulting in all children being affected. Therefore, the probability is 1.

Answer: F
