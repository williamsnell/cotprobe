Alright, so I've got this question about migration factors. The question is asking which of the options is NOT a pull factor. Pull factors are things that attract people to move to a place. Let me think through each option.

Option A: Better healthcare. Yeah, that makes sense. People would move where they can get better medical care, so that's a pull factor.

Option B: Job opportunities. Definitely a pull factor. People move where there are jobs available.

Option C: Better schools. Education is a big draw, especially for families with kids. So that's a pull factor.

Option D: Overcrowding. Wait, overcrowding is more of a push factor. It's something that makes people leave their current place rather than attract them to a new one. So this might be the exception.

Option E: Political freedom. Freedom is a strong attractor. People might move to places where they have more freedoms, so that's a pull factor.

Option F: Safety. Safer environments are definitely something that would pull people in.

Option G: Better climate. Who wouldn't want a nicer climate? That's a pull factor.

Option H: Lower taxes. Lower taxes can attract people, especially if they're looking to save money or have more disposable income.

So, going through each option, D: overcrowding stands out as a push factor, not a pull. The other options are all things that attract people, making them pull factors.

The question asks which factor is NOT a pull factor of migration. Pull factors are elements that attract people to move to a location. 

- **A: Better healthcare** - Attracts people, so it's a pull factor.  
- **B: Job opportunities** - Encourages migration, so it's a pull factor.  
- **C: Better schools** - Attracts families and individuals, so it's a pull factor.  
- **D: Overcrowding** - This is more of a push factor (something that makes people leave) rather than a pull factor.  
- **E: Political freedom** - Attracts people, so it's a pull factor.  
- **F: Safety** - A safe environment is a pull factor.  
- **G: Better climate** - Attracts people, so it's a pull factor.  
- **H: Lower taxes** - Can attract people, so it's a pull factor.  

The correct answer is **D: Overcrowding**, as it is not a pull factor but a push factor.  

Answer: D
