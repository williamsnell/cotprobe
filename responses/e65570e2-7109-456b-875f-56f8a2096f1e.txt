Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the inverse Laplace transform of 1 over (s - 1) squared. Hmm, I remember that Laplace transforms are used to convert functions from the time domain to the complex frequency domain, and the inverse does the opposite. But wait, how do I approach this using convolution? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

First, I know that sometimes it's easier to break down a complex function into simpler parts whose inverse transforms we already know. Convolution theorem says that the inverse Laplace transform of the product of two functions is the convolution of their inverse transforms. So maybe I can express 1/(s-1)^2 as a product of simpler terms.

Wait, let's think about standard Laplace transforms. I remember that L{e^{at}} = 1/(s-a). So for this case, a is 1. So L{e^t} = 1/(s-1). But here, the denominator is squared. Maybe I can think of 1/(s-1)^2 as 1/(s-1) multiplied by 1/(s-1). So, that would be the product of e^t with itself in the Laplace domain.

So, if F(s) = G(s) * H(s), then L^{-1}{F(s)} = g(t) * h(t), where * denotes convolution. In this case, both G(s) and H(s) are 1/(s-1), so their inverse transforms are both e^t. So the inverse Laplace would be e^t convolved with e^t.

Now, convolution of e^t with itself. I think the formula for convolution is the integral from 0 to t of g(τ)h(t-τ) dτ. So here, both g and h are e^τ and e^{t-τ}, respectively.

Let me compute that integral: ∫₀^t e^τ * e^{t-τ} dτ. Simplifying the exponents: e^τ * e^{t}e^{-τ} = e^{t} (e^τ * e^{-τ}) ) = e^{t} * e^{0} = e^{t}. So the integrand becomes e^t, which is a constant with respect to τ. So the integral is e^{t} * ∫₀^t dτ, which is e^{t} * t. So the result is t e^{t}.

Wait, let me double-check. Another approach: I remember that the Laplace transform of t e^{at} is 1/(s-a)^2. Oh right! So L{t e^t} = 1/(s-1)^2. So the inverse Laplace transform of 1/(s-1)^2 is t e^t. That matches what I got from convolution.

Looking at the options, E is te^t. So I think E is the correct answer.

The inverse Laplace transform of \( \frac{1}{(s-1)^2} \) can be found using the convolution property. Recognizing that \( \frac{1}{(s-1)^2} \) corresponds to the Laplace transform of \( t e^t \), the correct answer is E.

Answer: E
