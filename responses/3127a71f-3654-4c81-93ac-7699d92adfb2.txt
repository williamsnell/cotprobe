Okay, so I have this question about Critical Security Studies and the referent object of security. Hmm, I remember that in security studies, the referent object is what we're trying to protect. But wait, Critical Security Studies is a bit different from traditional approaches, right?

Let me think. In traditional security studies, like realist perspectives, the state is usually the primary referent. They focus on protecting the state's sovereignty and interests. But Critical Security Studies is more... critical, so it probably challenges that. I think CSS looks at a broader range of actors and issues beyond just the state.

The question gives options from A to J. Option J is "The state and state apparatus." But since CSS is critical, maybe it doesn't just focus on the state. Option B says "The people and their collectives." That sounds like it includes a wider range, like individuals and groups, not just states. 

Option E says "There is no specific referent point." Wait, that could be possible because CSS is so broad. But I think the referent isn't completely absent; it's just more inclusive. So E might not be the best answer. 

Option F is "The environment." That's more like environmental security, which is a subset, I think. Option I is "Political ideologies," which might be part of it, but I'm not sure if that's the main referent. 

Options A, C, D, G, H are more specific things like technological systems or military power, which don't seem to cover the broader picture that CSS emphasizes. 

So, putting it together, Critical Security Studies likely considers the people and their collectives as the referent because it's more inclusive and aligns with its critical approach, focusing on human security and societal aspects beyond the state.

The referent object of security in Critical Security Studies is broader than traditional approaches, emphasizing people and their collectives rather than just the state.
