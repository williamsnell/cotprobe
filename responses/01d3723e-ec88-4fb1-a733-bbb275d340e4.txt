Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically about what's admissible to prove someone's date of birth in a life insurance case. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is asking which of the options is inadmissible if offered to prove the insured's correct date of birth. The options are A through J, each presenting a different type of evidence.

First, I need to recall the rules of evidence, particularly the hearsay rule. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, and it's generally inadmissible unless there's an exception.

So, each option needs to be evaluated for whether it's hearsay and if it falls under any exception.

Option A: A diary entry from the insured's mother. Diaries are typically considered personal notes and can be admissible under the exception for entries in a personal diary or under the present sense impression exception if it's a recent entry. But wait, the mother is the declarant, and the plaintiff is using it to prove the date of birth. So, unless there's an exception, it might be hearsay. But I think diaries can be admissible as a present sense impression or under the exception for statements made for medical diagnosis or treatment, but I'm not entirely sure.

Option B: A family bible with the birth date. Family bibles are often considered reliable and can be admitted under the exception for ancient documents, which are documents whose authenticity is supported by circumstances indicating a lack of fraud and which are at least 20 years old. So, if the family bible is old enough, it's admissible.

Option C: A social media post celebrating the birthday. Social media posts are statements made by the insured, so if the insured is the declarant, it's a statement by a party opponent and thus admissible under the hearsay exception for admissions. So this would be admissible.

Option D: Hospital birth record. Birth records are typically considered public records and are admissible under the public records exception to hearsay. So this is admissible.

Option E: Driver's license copy with birth date. A driver's license is a government-issued ID, so it's an official record. Under the rule against hearsay, official records are admissible. So this is admissible.

Option F: Photocopy of the birth certificate. Birth certificates are official records, so they fall under the public records exception. They're admissible.

Option G: Family portrait with ages engraved. This is tricky. A family portrait with ages inscribedâ€”like a photo where the ages are part of the image. If it's a picture with the ages written on it, that's an out-of-court statement. Unless it's a statement by the party (if the insured is the one who wrote it), it might be hearsay. But if the ages are just listed on the frame or the photo, it's hearsay unless another exception applies. I'm not sure if engraved ages on a portrait count as a statement by a party opponent. Maybe not. So this might be inadmissible unless it's a business record or something else, but I don't think so.

Option H: Letter from a childhood friend recalling shared birthdays. This is hearsay because it's a statement made by someone else (the friend) about the insured's birthday. Unless there's an exception like a declaration for pedigree (which applies to genealogical matters), I don't think this is admissible. So this might be inadmissible.

Option I: School records indicating the date of birth. School records are official records, so they fall under the public records exception. Admissible.

Option J: Sworn affidavit from the insured's brother. An affidavit is a written statement under oath. The brother's statement would be hearsay unless it's based on personal knowledge and maybe falls under a hearsay exception like former testimony or a statement against interest. But if the brother is testifying, he can be cross-examined, but an affidavit is written. So if it's a sworn statement, it might be admissible if it's not hearsay or falls under a hearsay exception. Alternatively, if the brother is available to testify, the affidavit might not be allowed unless it's for a specific purpose, like prior inconsistent statement, but I'm not sure. Wait, but the option says it's a sworn affidavit offered to prove the birth date. So unless it's a statement against interest or something else, it might be inadmissible as hearsay. Wait, but the brother is a family member; maybe the statement isn't against his interest. So unless it's an exception, it's inadmissible.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The question is which is inadmissible. So I need to find the option that doesn't fit any hearsay exception.

Option A: Diary entry. Hearsay, but perhaps admissible under present sense impression or as a personal entry. So probably admissible.

Option B: Family bible, likely admissible under ancient document exception.

Option C: Social media post, admissible as admission.

Option D: Hospital record, public record.

Option E: Driver's license, official record.

Option F: Birth certificate, same as D.

Option G: Family portrait with ages. If the ages are recorded on the portrait, it's hearsay unless it's a business record or something. But family portraits are not business records. So unless the ages are considered a present sense impression, which they might not be, this is inadmissible.

Option H: Letter from friend. Hearsay, no exception. So inadmissible.

Option I: School records, admissible.

Option J: Affidavit from brother. Affidavits can be tricky. If the brother is testifying, his affidavit might not be needed, but if he's not available, maybe it's admissible under former testimony. But in this case, the question is about the insured's date of birth, so the brother's knowledge would be based on his own knowledge, perhaps. But unless it's a statement against interest or a declaration by a party opponent, it's inadmissible as hearsay.

Wait, but the brother's affidavit is being offered to prove the insured's birth date. If the brother is a party (he's the insured's brother), then his statement would be an admission by a party opponent, making it admissible. Because admissions are exceptions to hearsay. So J would be admissible.

So, now, which options are inadmissible? Let's see:

A: Admissible.

B: Admissible.

C: Admissible.

D: Admissible.

E: Admissible.

F: Admissible.

G: Inadmissible.

H: Inadmissible.

I: Admissible.

J: Admissible.

Wait, so both G and H are inadmissible? Or am I missing something?

Wait, the question asks which is inadmissible. So perhaps more than one option is inadmissible, but the options are A to J, and the question is to pick one.

Wait, let me re-examine the options.

Option G: Family portrait engraved with ages. If the ages are written on the portrait, that's a statement by someone else, perhaps the artist or a family member. Unless it's a statement by the insured, but if the insured didn't make it, it's hearsay. So G is inadmissible.

Option H: Letter from friend. Friend's statement is hearsay, no exception. So H is inadmissible.

Option J: Affidavit from brother. If the brother is a party, then his statement is an admission, so it's admissible. So J is admissible.

So, between G and H, both are inadmissible. But the options are A to J, and the question states "which of the following is inadmissible," implying only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Let me go through each option again.

Option A: Diary entry. The mother's diary. If the mother made the entry, it's a personal diary. Under the hearsay rule, entries in a personal diary are admissible under the exception for entries in a personal notebook made by the declarant, provided they were made in good faith. So A is admissible.

Option B: Family bible. As an ancient document, it's admissible.

Option C: Social media post by the insured. Admissible as a party admission.

Option D: Hospital record. Public record, admissible.

Option E: Driver's license. Official record, admissible.

Option F: Birth certificate. Official record, admissible.

Option G: Family portrait with ages. If the ages are inscribed on the portrait, it's a statement by someone, perhaps the artist, but unless it's a present sense impression or a business record, it's hearsay. Since it's a family portrait, probably not a business record. So G is inadmissible.

Option H: Letter from friend. Friend's statement, hearsay, no exception. Inadmissible.

Option I: School record. Official record, admissible.

Option J: Brother's affidavit. Since the brother is the insured's brother, but the insured is the party in the case. Wait, the plaintiff is suing the insurance company, so the insured is a third party? Or is the insured the plaintiff? Wait, the plaintiff is suing the insurance company, so the insured is the policyholder, probably the plaintiff. So the brother's statement would be an admission by a party opponent (the plaintiff's brother's statement about the plaintiff's birth date). So J is admissible as an admission.

So, the inadmissible options are G and H. But the question is asking for one answer. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the family portrait is considered a statement by the declarant if the insured wrote it, but if it's just engraved by someone else, it's hearsay. So G is inadmissible.

Similarly, H is inadmissible.

But the options are A to J, so perhaps the question expects only one correct answer. Let me check the options again.

The question is about the insured's correct date of birth. So, which evidence is inadmissible?

Option G: Family portrait with ages. If the ages were inscribed by someone else, it's hearsay. Unless it's a business record, but it's a family portrait, so probably not. So G is inadmissible.

Option H: Letter from friend. Hearsay, no exception. So H is inadmissible.

But the options don't have both G and H. So perhaps the intended answer is H, because family portraits are perhaps considered reliable, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the family portrait is considered a statement by the person whose age is recorded, but if the insured didn't make the statement, it's hearsay.

Wait, the problem is that the family portrait's ages are inscribed. If the person who inscribed the ages is unknown, it's hearsay. If the insured wrote it, then it's an admission.

But the question doesn't specify who inscribed the ages. So we have to assume it's someone else, making it hearsay without an exception. So G is inadmissible.

Similarly, H is inadmissible.

But since the question asks for one answer, perhaps the intended answer is H, as it's a letter from a friend, which is more clearly hearsay without an exception, whereas G might be considered a statement by the insured if they commissioned the portrait.

Alternatively, maybe the family portrait is not hearsay if it's a description of a matter observed, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the family portrait's inscribed ages would be considered a statement offered to prove the age, which is the date of birth. So it's hearsay unless it's a business record. But family portraits aren't business records. So G is inadmissible.

Similarly, H is inadmissible.

But the options don't have both as correct. Maybe the best answer is H, as it's a letter from a friend recalling shared birthdays. That's more clearly hearsay without an exception.

Alternatively, perhaps the family portrait is considered a statement by the insured if the insured was involved in the inscription. But without that information, we can't assume that.

So, perhaps the answer is H.

Wait, but the question is about the 'last' character, so it's a single answer.

I think the answer is H: A letter from the insured's childhood friend, recalling their shared birthdays.

Because that's a statement by a non-party, non-expert, which doesn't fall under any hearsay exception, making it inadmissible.

Alternatively, G might be inadmissible as well, but perhaps the intended answer is H.

The question asks which evidence is inadmissible to prove the insured's correct date of birth. To determine this, each option is analyzed under the hearsay rule and its exceptions.

- **Option A**: A diary entry from the insured's mother is admissible under the exception for entries in a personal diary.
- **Option B**: A family bible is admissible as an ancient document.
- **Option C**: A social media post by the insured is admissible as a party admission.
- **Option D**: A hospital birth record is admissible as a public record.
- **Option E**: A copy of the insured's driver's license is admissible as an official record.
- **Option F**: A photocopy of the insured's birth certificate is admissible as a public record.
- **Option G**: A family portrait with ages inscribed is inadmissible because it is hearsay without a applicable exception.
- **Option H**: A letter from the insured's childhood friend is inadmissible as it is hearsay without an exception.
- **Option I**: A school record is admissible as an official record.
- **Option J**: A sworn affidavit from the insured's brother is admissible as an admission by a party opponent.

Both **G** and **H** are inadmissible, but the question likely expects one answer. Since **H** is a letter from a friend and does not fall under any hearsay exception, it is the best choice.

Answer: H
