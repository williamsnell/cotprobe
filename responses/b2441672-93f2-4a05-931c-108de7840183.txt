Okay, so I have this question about VGGNets and AlexNet, and some statements about their characteristics and other related concepts. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to break it down step by step.

First, let's look at Statement 1: "VGGNets have convolutional kernels of smaller width and height than AlexNet's first-layer kernels." I remember that AlexNet was one of the early deep learning models, and it used convolutional layers. From what I recall, AlexNet's first convolutional layer used 11x11 kernels. Then VGGNets came along, and I think their kernels were smaller. VGGNets, if I'm not mistaken, used 3x3 kernels throughout their architecture. So yes, 3x3 is smaller than 11x11. So Statement 1 should be True.

Now, Statement 2: "Data-dependent weight initialization procedures were introduced before Batch Normalization." I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I know that weight initialization is important for training deep networks. Techniques like He initialization or Xavier/Glorot initialization come to mind. Batch Normalization was introduced by Ioffe and Szegedy in 2015 as a way to normalize the activations of the layers, which helps in training deeper networks by reducing internal covariate shift. Data-dependent initializations, like those that use the batch variance, might have been introduced around that time or maybe earlier. Wait, wasn't there something called "Batch Normalization" that also involved initializing weights differently? Or perhaps the initialization procedures that depend on data (like those used in BN) came after BN itself. I think that some initialization methods that are data-dependent might have been introduced after BN became popular. For example, the idea of using batch statistics for initialization could be part of what BN does. So if BN came before, and data-dependent initializations were part of BN, then Statement 2 would be False, because data-dependent methods were introduced with or after BN, not before. Alternatively, maybe before BN, people used initialization methods that didn't depend on data as much. I'm a bit unsure here, but I think Statement 2 is False because data-dependent initializations like those in BN came after or were part of BN's introduction, so they weren't introduced before BN.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think again. Before BN, people used initialization methods like Xavier or He. Those are data-independent because they don't rely on the actual data's variance. Data-dependent initializations would come after, maybe as part of techniques that adjust based on the data during training, like what BN does. So yes, data-dependent weight init was introduced after BN, making Statement 2 False.

So Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is False. Looking at the options, E is True, False. So the answer should be E.

The answer is E: True, False.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Statement 1 Analysis:**
   - AlexNet's first convolutional layer uses 11x11 kernels.
   - VGGNets use 3x3 kernels in their architecture.
   - Therefore, VGGNet kernels are smaller, making Statement 1 True.

2. **Statement 2 Analysis:**
   - Data-dependent weight initialization, such as those used in Batch Normalization (BN), were introduced alongside BN in 2015.
   - Before BN, initializations like Xavier or He were data-independent.
   - Thus, data-dependent methods came after BN, making Statement 2 False.

**Answer: E**

E: True, False
