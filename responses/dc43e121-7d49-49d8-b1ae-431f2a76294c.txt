Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about Feminist Therapy. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about Fara's responsibilities as a child. She helped her mother in the kitchen, while her brother and father mowed the lawn. So, Fara was expected to do housework like her mother, and her brother did yard work like their father. The question is asking which part of Feminist Therapy addresses these issues.

The options are A through J, but looking at the list provided, they are labeled A to H. The options are:

A: Self-Concept Therapy
B: Feminist Object Relations
C: Household Responsibilities
D: Maternal Role Therapy
E: Empowerment Therapy
F: Family Dynamics Therapy
G: Child Responsibility Therapy
H: Women's Rights Therapy

I need to figure out which of these relates to the scenario described. So, Feminist Therapy focuses on issues related to gender, equality, and empowerment. It addresses how societal roles and expectations affect individuals, especially women.

In the question, Fara's role is traditional—helping her mother with housework, while her brother does yard work, which is more stereotypically male. This seems to point to gender roles and how they're assigned and enforced within families.

Looking at the options:

A: Self-Concept Therapy – This seems more general, focusing on how someone views themselves. It might touch on gender roles, but I'm not sure it's specific enough.

B: Feminist Object Relations – I'm not too familiar with this term. Object relations in psychology refers to how people relate to others based on early relationships, often with parents. Feminist Object Relations might look at how gender roles are formed through these relationships. This could be a contender.

C: Household Responsibilities – This seems too specific and maybe not a formal part of Feminist Therapy. It's more about the tasks themselves rather than the underlying issues.

D: Maternal Role Therapy – This seems to focus on the mother's role, perhaps helping women accept or navigate their maternal responsibilities. But the question is broader, about the division of labor between genders.

E: Empowerment Therapy – Feminist Therapy does emphasize empowerment, helping individuals recognize and challenge oppressive structures. This seems relevant because Fara's situation is about unequal gender roles that might disempower her.

F: Family Dynamics Therapy – This is a broader term, looking at family interactions and structures. While it's related, Feminist Therapy might have a specific angle here, so maybe not the best fit.

G: Child Responsibility Therapy – This seems to focus on children's roles and responsibilities, which is part of the scenario, but again, not specific to the feminist perspective.

H: Women's Rights Therapy – This seems closely related, focusing on advocating for women's rights and addressing inequalities. However, I'm not sure if this is a recognized term within Feminist Therapy.

Now, thinking about Feminist Therapy's core concepts: It often examines how gender roles are socially constructed and how they impact individuals. It aims to empower women by helping them recognize and challenge these roles. So, the issue here is about the division of labor based on gender, which is a classic feminist issue.

Between the options, E: Empowerment Therapy seems directly related because it's about empowering individuals to challenge and change their circumstances. B: Feminist Object Relations might also be relevant, but I'm not as confident about that term. H: Women's Rights Therapy is another possibility, but I'm not sure if that's a standard term in Feminist Therapy.

Wait, another angle: Feminist Therapy often looks at how family dynamics reinforce gender roles. So, Family Dynamics Therapy (F) might be part of it, but I'm not sure if that's the specific part addressing the issue here.

Alternatively, the scenario is about Fara being assigned traditional female roles, which could be part of Maternal Role Therapy (D), but that might be too narrow.

Empowerment Therapy (E) seems to encompass the idea of helping Fara recognize the unfairness of her role and empowering her to change it. So, that's likely the correct answer.
</think>

The scenario describes Fara being assigned traditional gender roles, which is a key issue addressed by Feminist Therapy. Feminist Therapy focuses on empowering individuals to recognize and challenge gender-based inequalities. Among the options, Empowerment Therapy (E) directly aligns with this goal, as it aims to help individuals confront and change oppressive structures, such as the unequal division of labor based on gender.

Answer: E
