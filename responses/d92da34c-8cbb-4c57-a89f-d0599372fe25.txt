Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the molar mass of a monoprotic weak acid. Hmm, monoprotic means it donates one proton, right? So it's something like CH3COOH or similar. The problem says that 26.3 mL of 0.122 M KOH is needed to neutralize 0.682 grams of the acid. 

Alright, I think the first step is to figure out how many moles of KOH are involved. Because KOH is a strong base, it'll react completely with the weak acid. The reaction should be something like HA + KOH → KA + H2O. Since it's monoprotic, the mole ratio is 1:1. So moles of KOH equal moles of HA.

Wait, let me get that straight. Moles of KOH would be Molarity × Volume. The volume is in mL, so I should convert that to liters. 26.3 mL is 0.0263 L. So moles of KOH = 0.122 M * 0.0263 L. Let me calculate that. 0.122 * 0.0263 is... let's see, 0.122 times 0.0263. Hmm, 0.122 * 26.3 is 3.2006, then moving the decimal four places because it's 0.0263, so 0.0032006 moles. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 0.122 * 0.0263 should be 0.0032006 moles of KOH.

Since the acid is monoprotic, moles of acid are also 0.0032006. Now, the mass of the acid is 0.682 grams. Molar mass (M) is mass divided by moles. So M = 0.682 g / 0.0032006 mol. Let me compute that. 0.682 divided by 0.0032006. 

Wait, 0.0032006 is approximately 3.2006e-3. So 0.682 / 0.0032006 ≈ let me do this step by step. 0.682 divided by 0.0032 is about 213.125. Because 0.0032 times 213 is 0.6816, which is close to 0.682. So the molar mass is approximately 213 g/mol.

Looking at the options, option C is 212 g/mol. That's pretty close, considering rounding. So I think the correct answer is C.

The problem involves finding the molar mass of a monoprotic weak acid. First, calculate the moles of KOH used:  
\[
\text{Moles of KOH} = 0.122 \, \text{M} \times 0.0263 \, \text{L} = 0.0032006 \, \text{mol}.
\]  
Since the acid is monoprotic, the moles of acid are equal to the moles of KOH. Using the mass of the acid (0.682 g), the molar mass is calculated as:  
\[
\text{Molar mass} = \frac{0.682 \, \text{g}}{0.0032006 \, \text{mol}} \approx 213 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]  
The closest option is **C: 212 g mol⁻¹**.

Answer: C
