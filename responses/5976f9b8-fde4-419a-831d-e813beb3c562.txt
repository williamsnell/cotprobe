Okay, so I have this question about the 'Lotus principle'. I'm a bit rusty on my international law, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the Lotus principle is a concept in international law. It's something about the limits of state jurisdiction. I think it's related to the idea that states can't assume jurisdiction unless it's explicitly allowed by international law. Or wait, maybe it's the opposite? Let me recall.

I think it comes from the Lotus case, which was a significant court case. The Lotus case involved a Turkish vessel and a French vessel in international waters. There was an incident where a French citizen was killed on the Turkish ship. The French authorities boarded the Turkish ship and arrested the suspect. The Turkish government protested, arguing that the French had overstepped their jurisdiction.

The court ruled in favor of Turkey, stating that France didn't have jurisdiction because there was no treaty allowing them to do so. The key idea here was that states are only allowed to exercise jurisdiction if it's permitted by international law. So, the default is that states can't interfere unless it's allowed.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one matches this understanding. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Customary law is superior to treaty law. Hmm, I don't think that's right. The Lotus case was about jurisdictional limits and what's allowed under international law, not about the hierarchy between customary law and treaties.

Option B: States can intervene if it's about national security. That sounds more like the concept of national security exceptions, but not specifically the Lotus principle.

Option C: States can apply their own laws in disputes. That doesn't sound right either. The Lotus principle is more about the limits of jurisdiction rather than applying domestic laws.

Option D: International law governs state relations, not individuals. This is a broader concept, more about the subject of international law. The Lotus principle is about jurisdictional limits, so maybe not this.

Option E: Unlimited jurisdiction over their own citizens. That's more about the concept of territoriality or maybe jus sanguinis, but again, not the Lotus principle.

Option F: States can ignore international law as long as they don't infringe on others' sovereignty. That seems off because the Lotus principle is about when states can exercise jurisdiction, not about ignoring international law.

Option G: Restrictions can't be presumed, so whatever isn't prohibited is permitted. Wait, that sounds familiar. The Lotus case said that states can't assume jurisdiction unless it's allowed. So, if something isn't prohibited, it's allowed. So this seems like a match.

Option H: States can assert enforcement on the high seas. I think the high seas are under the jurisdiction of no state, so this might relate to enforcement elsewhere, but not the main point of the Lotus principle.

Option I: Customary law from state practice and opinio juris. That's how customary law is formed, but not specifically the Lotus principle.

Option J: Free to choose the court for disputes. That's more about dispute resolution mechanisms, like the International Court of Justice, but not the Lotus principle.

So, Option G seems to capture the essence of the Lotus principle. The idea is that states are free to act unless international law prohibits it. So, the principle is that unless something is explicitly forbidden, it's allowed.
</think>

The Lotus principle, arising from the Lotus case, establishes that states are not permitted to exercise jurisdiction unless it is explicitly allowed by international law. This means that states cannot assume jurisdiction over matters outside their own territory unless there is a specific treaty or international agreement allowing it. The principle emphasizes that states are free to act in their own interests unless prohibited by international law.

Answer: G
