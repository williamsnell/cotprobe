Okay, so I've got this question about a voltmeter's accuracy and how to find the limiting error percentage. Let me try to think through it step by step. 

The question says the voltmeter has a range of 0 to 100 volts and a guaranteed accuracy of 2% of full scale reading. So, the full scale is 100 V, right? That means the maximum possible error is 2% of 100 V. Let me calculate that. 2% of 100 is 2 volts. So, the voltmeter can be off by ±2 V from the actual voltage.

Now, the measured voltage is 75 V. But wait, the error is based on the full scale, not the measured value. So, the absolute error is ±2 V. To find the percentage error relative to the measured value, I think I need to calculate (error / measured voltage) * 100%.

So, the error is 2 V, and the measured voltage is 75 V. Plugging in the numbers: (2 / 75) * 100. Let me do that math. 2 divided by 75 is... 0.026666... Multiply by 100 gives 2.666...%, which is approximately 2.666%. Looking at the options, option B is 2.66%, which matches this. 

Wait, but I should make sure I'm not mixing up relative and absolute errors. The voltmeter's accuracy is given as a percentage of full scale, so the absolute error is 2 V. But when they ask for the limiting error in percentage, I think they want the relative error based on the actual reading, not the full scale. So yes, that's why I divided by 75 V, not 100 V.

Another way to think about it: if the voltage was 100 V, the error would be 2% of 100, which is 2 V. So the percentage error would be exactly 2% in that case. But for 75 V, the same absolute error of 2 V would be a higher percentage relative to 75. So 2/75 is about 2.66%, which is option B. 

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was to apply the error as a percentage of the measured value, not the full scale. So the answer should be option B.

The voltmeter has a guaranteed accuracy of 2% of its full scale (100 V), resulting in an absolute error of ±2 V. To find the limiting error percentage relative to the measured voltage of 75 V, calculate (2 / 75) * 100% ≈ 2.66%. 

Answer: B
