Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about Rachels' thought experiment with Smith and Jones. I remember that Rachels uses this example to discuss the differences between killing and letting die. Let me think through this step by step.

In the scenario, Smith is holding a child underwater, which leads to the child's death. The question is asking what Smith's action is an example of. The options include things like euthanasia, self-defense, natural death, etc.

I recall that Rachels' point is that sometimes our moral evaluations can be influenced by whether we're directly causing harm (killing) or allowing harm to happen (letting die). In this case, Smith is actively holding the child underwater, which directly causes the child's death. So his action is an example of killing because he's taking direct action to cause the death.

Looking at the options, option I is "killing." Other options like H ("letting die") would apply if Smith had failed to save the child, like not rescuing someone in a dangerous situation. But since Smith is actively involved, it's more about killing rather than letting die.

So, putting it all together, Smith's action is an example of killing, which corresponds to option I.

The answer is I: killing.
