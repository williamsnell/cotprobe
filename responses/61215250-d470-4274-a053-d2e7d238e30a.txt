Okay, so I have this question about Tay-Sachs disease and its cause. I'm a bit rusty on my genetics and enzyme deficiencies, but let me try to think this through step by step.

First, I remember that Tay-Sachs is a genetic disorder. It's one of those lysosomal storage diseases, right? Lysosomes are the recycling centers of the cell, breaking down various molecules. If there's a deficiency in a specific enzyme, certain molecules can't be broken down properly, leading to their accumulation in the lysosomes. This accumulation causes various health problems.

I think Tay-Sachs is particularly associated with the GM2 gangliosides. Gangliosides are a type of lipid found in the brain and神经系统. GM2 is one of the gangliosides, and when it's not broken down properly, it builds up in the cells, especially in the brain. This leads to the neurological symptoms associated with Tay-Sachs, like vision problems, muscle weakness, and developmental delays.

So, which enzyme is responsible for breaking down GM2 gangliosides? I remember that the enzyme involved is a hexosaminidase. Hexosaminidases are a group of enzymes that break down glycosaminoglycans, which are long chains of sugar molecules. There are different types of hexosaminidases, like A and B. I think Tay-Sachs is linked to a deficiency in Hexosaminidase A.

Wait, but I've also heard about another enzyme called Hexosaminidase B. I think they work together, but in different parts of the cell. Hexosaminidase A is involved in the lysosomal breakdown, while Hexosaminidase B is cytosolic, meaning it's in the cell's cytoplasm. So, when Hexosaminidase A is deficient, GM2 doesn't get broken down properly, leading to Tay-Sachs.

Looking at the options: Option C is Hexosaminidase B, and Option F is Hexosaminidase A. So, the correct answer should be F. But wait, I want to make sure I'm not mixing up the letters.

Another way to think about it: Tay-Sachs is caused by a mutation in the HEXA gene, which stands for Hexosaminidase A. That gene provides instructions for making the enzyme Hexosaminidase A. Without enough of this enzyme, the body can't process GM2 gangliosides, leading to their accumulation.

I should also consider the other options to rule them out. Option A is Alpha-L-iduronidase, which I think is related to another lysosomal storage disease, maybe MPS I (Hurler syndrome). Option B is Arylsulfatase A, which is involved in sulfatosis, a different group of diseases. Option D is Glucose-6-phosphatase, which I associate with glycogen storage diseases, like von Gierke disease. Option E is Lysosomal alpha-glucosidase, which is relevant to Pompe disease. Option G is Glucocerebrosidase, linked to Gaucher disease. Option H is Homogentisic acid oxidase, which is connected to alkaptonuria. Option I is Galactosidase Alpha, perhaps related to some other glycosidase deficiency, and Option J is Alpha-galactosidase A, which I think is involved in Fabry disease.

So, none of the other options fit the description of Tay-Sachs. It's definitely Hexosaminidase A, which is option F.

Tay-Sachs disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of Hexosaminidase A. This enzyme is responsible for breaking down GM2 gangliosides, and its deficiency leads to the accumulation of these molecules in the lysosomes, causing neurological symptoms. Among the options provided, Hexosaminidase A corresponds to option F.

Answer: F
