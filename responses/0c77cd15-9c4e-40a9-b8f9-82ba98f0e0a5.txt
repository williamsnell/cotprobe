Question:

Two men agreed to burglarize a home. While they were planning the burglary, the two men learned that the home had a sophisticated alarm system that needed to be disarmed. One of the men told the other that he knew an alarm specialist who could help disarm the security system. One of the men then approached the alarm specialist and asked if he would assist them in disarming the home's alarm system. The alarm specialist said that he didn't want to participate in the crime but told the man how he could disarm the system himself. The two men thereafter went to the home to commit the burglary. When they arrived at the home, they saw a vicious guard dog patrolling the fenced-in area of the home. Deciding it would be too risky to confront the dog, the two men abandoned their planned burglary. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the criminal liability of the two men and the alarm specialist?

Options:

A: The two men are not guilty of any crime, and the alarm specialist is guilty of conspiracy and attempted burglary.
B: The two men are guilty of attempted burglary, but not conspiracy. The alarm specialist is not guilty of any crime.
C: The two men and the alarm specialist are guilty of both conspiracy and attempted burglary.
D: The two men are guilty of conspiracy and the two men and the alarm specialist are guilty of attempted burglary.
E: The two men and the alarm specialist are guilty of conspiracy.
F: The two men and the alarm specialist are guilty of attempted burglary, but not conspiracy.
G: The two men are not guilty of any crime because they didn't commit the burglary. The alarm specialist is guilty of conspiracy.
H: The two men are guilty of conspiracy and attempted burglary, but the alarm specialist is not guilty of any crime.
I: The alarm specialist is guilty of conspiracy, but the two men are not guilty of any crime because they didn't commit the burglary.
J: The two men are guilty of conspiracy.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about criminal liability involving two men and an alarm specialist. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: Two men plan to burglarize a home with an alarm system. They learn it's sophisticated, so one of them tells the other he knows an alarm specialist who can help. The second man then approaches the specialist. The specialist refuses to participate but tells him how to disarm the system. The two men then go to the home but see a guard dog and abandon their plan.

I need to figure out the criminal liability of each person involved: the two men and the alarm specialist.

Let's start by recalling some criminal law concepts. Conspiracy involves an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime, and each conspirator is liable for the crime agreed upon. Attempted burglary would be when someone takes a substantial step towards committing burglary but doesn't complete it.

So, the two men initially agreed to burglarize the home. That sounds like conspiracy. But they also went to the home, which might be an attempt. But then they saw the dog and left. Did they commit the burglary? No, they abandoned the attempt.

The alarm specialist taught them how to disarm the alarm. He didn't participate but gave them the info. So, did he conspire with them? Conspiracy requires an agreement. If the specialist agreed to help, even if he later refused, that might count. But here, the specialist didn't want to participate, so maybe there's no conspiracy. Alternatively, if he provided the means, perhaps aiding and abetting.

Wait, but conspiracy is about the agreement. If the specialist only provided information without agreeing to the plan, maybe he didn't conspire. But the two men definitely conspired among themselves. The specialist might be guilty of something else, like aiding and abetting attempted burglary if he provided assistance.

So the two men agreed to commit burglary, which is conspiracy. Then, they took steps towards it by going to the home, which could be an attempt. But since they didn't complete the burglary, they might be guilty of attempted burglary as well.

What about the specialist? If he taught them how to disarm the alarm, he might be aiding and abetting their attempt. But if he didn't agree to the overall plan, maybe not conspiracy. But in some jurisdictions, if he provided material assistance, he could be liable for the attempt.

Wait, but in this case, the specialist didn't actually help them on the day. He just gave them information. So perhaps he's not directly involved in the commission of the crime beyond giving advice. Some jurisdictions might see this as aiding and abetting if the information was sufficient to commit the crime.

Alternatively, if the specialist gave them the information, and they used it to attempt the burglary, he might be guilty of conspiracy or aiding and abetting. But since he didn't participate in the actual attempt, maybe it's more about whether he intended for them to use the info to commit a crime.

In some cases, if someone provides the means to commit a crime, knowing that it will be used for that purpose, they can be held liable as an accomplice. So the specialist might be guilty of aiding and abetting the attempted burglary.

Looking back at the options:

Option H says the two men are guilty of conspiracy and attempted burglary, but the specialist isn't guilty. But if the specialist provided assistance, he might be guilty of aiding and abetting.

Option D says the two men are guilty of conspiracy, and all three are guilty of attempted burglary. But the specialist didn't go to the home; he only gave info. So maybe he's not part of the attempt.

Alternatively, the two men have conspiracy among themselves. They attempted burglary, so each is guilty of both. The specialist might not be guilty of conspiracy but could be guilty of aiding and abetting the attempt.

Wait, but in some jurisdictions, aiding and abetting an attempt can be treated as the same as attempting. So the specialist could be guilty of attempted burglary as an accomplice.

But the question is about conspiracy and attempted burglary. The two men definitely have conspiracy because they agreed to commit the crime. They also attempted, so they're guilty of both. The specialist, if he agreed to the conspiracy, would be part of it, but if he didn't, maybe not.

But in the scenario, the specialist refused to participate. He told them how to disarm the system but didn't join them. So perhaps he didn't agree to the conspiracy. But he provided the means, which could be seen as aiding and abetting.

Wait, but the two men approached the specialist and asked him to assist. He declined but gave info. So the two men's conspiracy is between themselves, and the specialist didn't join in the conspiracy. Therefore, the specialist isn't part of the conspiracy.

But the two men used the specialist's information to commit the attempt. So the specialist might be guilty of aiding and abetting the attempt, which could make him guilty of attempted burglary as an accomplice.

So the two men are guilty of conspiracy (because they agreed) and attempted burglary (because they went to the home). The specialist is guilty of aiding and abetting the attempted burglary, so he could be charged with that.

Looking at the options, option H says the two men are guilty of conspiracy and attempted burglary, and the specialist isn't guilty. But if the specialist is guilty of aiding the attempt, then he would be. But none of the options combine that.

Wait, the options don't have an option where the specialist is guilty of aiding and abetting. Let me check the options again.

Option H: Two men guilty of conspiracy and attempted. Specialist not guilty.

Option D: Two men guilty of conspiracy; all three guilty of attempted.

Option B: Two men guilty of attempted, not conspiracy. Specialist not guilty.

Hmm. So perhaps the specialist isn't guilty of anything because he didn't agree to the conspiracy, and his providing info wasn't enough to be aiding and abetting. Alternatively, in some cases, if he intended for them to use the info for the crime, he could be.

Wait, but if the two men approached him and he told them how to disarm, he might have known they were planning a burglary. So he provided assistance with the intent that they use it for the crime. That could be aiding and abetting.

In that case, the specialist would be guilty of aiding and abetting the attempted burglary. So the two men are guilty of conspiracy and attempted, and the specialist is guilty of attempted as an accomplice.

But looking at the options, option D says all three are guilty of attempted burglary. But the two men also have conspiracy. So the correct answer would be D if the specialist is guilty of attempted, but the question is whether he's also guilty of conspiracy.

Wait, the two men have conspiracy between themselves. The specialist didn't agree to the conspiracy, so he's not part of that. So the two men are guilty of conspiracy and attempted, and the specialist is guilty of aiding and abetting the attempt.

But in the options, which one matches this? Let's see:

Option H: Two men guilty of conspiracy and attempted; specialist not guilty. But if the specialist is guilty of attempted, H is wrong.

Option D: Two men guilty of conspiracy, all three guilty of attempted. So two men and specialist all guilty of attempted.

But the specialist didn't commit the attempt himself; he just provided info. So perhaps he's only an accomplice for the attempt, making him guilty of attempted burglary as an accomplice.

In that case, the two men are guilty of conspiracy and attempted, and the specialist is guilty of attempted as an accomplice. So looking at the options, does any option say that?

Option D says two men guilty of conspiracy, and all three guilty of attempted. That would include the specialist in the attempted charge. But the specialist didn't attempt; he just provided info. So perhaps he's guilty of aiding and abetting, which is a form of attempt liability.

Alternatively, some jurisdictions might not hold the specialist liable because he didn't participate in the attempt itself. But I think the law generally holds that if someone provides substantial assistance with the intent that the crime be committed, they can be liable as an accomplice.

So, the two men are guilty of conspiracy (they agreed) and attempted burglary (they took a step). The specialist is guilty of aiding and abetting the attempted burglary, so he's guilty of that as well.

Looking at the options, option D says the two men are guilty of conspiracy and the three are guilty of attempted. So the two men have both charges, and the specialist only the attempted. But option D says all three are guilty of attempted.

Wait, but the question is about the most accurate statement. So the two men are guilty of conspiracy and attempted, and the specialist is guilty of attempted as an accomplice.

But looking at the options, which one fits? Let's see:

Option H: Two men guilty of conspiracy and attempted; specialist not guilty. No, because the specialist is guilty.

Option D: Two men guilty of conspiracy; all three guilty of attempted. So that would mean the specialist is guilty of attempted.

So if the specialist is guilty of attempted, then D would be correct. But I'm not sure if the specialist is guilty of conspiracy. He didn't agree to it; he only provided info. So he's not part of the conspiracy.

Thus, the two men are guilty of conspiracy and attempted, and the specialist is guilty of attempted as an accomplice.

Looking back at the options, option D says the two men are guilty of conspiracy, and all three are guilty of attempted. That would include the specialist in the attempted charge. But the question is whether the specialist is guilty of attempted.

Alternatively, perhaps the specialist isn't guilty of anything because he didn't participate in the attempt. He just gave info, but without his info, the two men couldn't have attempted. So perhaps he's guilty of aiding and abetting.

But the options don't have a choice where the specialist is guilty of attempted but not conspiracy. The closest is option H, but it says the specialist isn't guilty. Alternatively, option D includes the specialist in the attempted charge.

Wait, perhaps the two men are guilty of conspiracy and attempted, and the specialist is guilty of conspiracy as well because he agreed to help. But he said he didn't want to participate, so maybe no.

I think the correct answer is that the two men are guilty of conspiracy and attempted, and the specialist isn't guilty of conspiracy but might be guilty of aiding and abetting the attempt. However, the options don't have that. So perhaps the best fit is option H, where the two men are guilty of both, and the specialist isn't guilty.

Wait, but the specialist provided information that enabled the attempt. So he is an accomplice. Without his help, the two men might not have been able to proceed. So he's guilty of aiding and abetting the attempted burglary.

In that case, the two men are guilty of conspiracy and attempted, and the specialist is guilty of attempted as an accomplice. So looking at the options, option D says all three are guilty of attempted, but the two men are also guilty of conspiracy.

So the correct answer would be that the two men are guilty of both conspiracy and attempted, and the specialist is guilty of attempted. But the options don't have that combination. The closest is option D, which says the two men are guilty of conspiracy, and all three are guilty of attempted. So the specialist is included in the attempted charge.

Alternatively, perhaps the specialist isn't guilty of any crime because he didn't participate in the actual attempt. He just gave information, but without more, maybe it's not enough.

I'm a bit confused, but I think the two men are guilty of conspiracy and attempted, and the specialist is guilty of aiding and abetting the attempted burglary. So among the options, option D says all three are guilty of attempted, which would include the specialist. But the two men are also guilty of conspiracy.

Wait, the question is about the most accurate statement. So the two men are guilty of both conspiracy and attempted. The specialist isn't guilty of conspiracy but is guilty of attempted as an accomplice. However, looking at the options, option H says the two men are guilty of conspiracy and attempted, and the specialist isn't guilty. But if the specialist is guilty of attempted, H is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the specialist isn't guilty because he didn't agree to the conspiracy and his info wasn't enough to constitute aiding and abetting. But I think providing the means to commit a crime can be aiding and abetting.

I'm going to conclude that the two men are guilty of conspiracy and attempted, and the specialist is guilty of aiding and abetting the attempted burglary. Therefore, the answer would be that the two men are guilty of both, and the specialist is guilty of attempted. Looking at the options, option D says all three are guilty of attempted, but the two men are also guilty of conspiracy. So the correct option is H, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no. Option H says the two men are guilty of conspiracy and attempted, and the specialist isn't guilty. But if the specialist is guilty of attempted, then H is wrong. So perhaps the correct answer is that the two men are guilty of conspiracy and attempted, and the specialist isn't guilty. So option H.

Alternatively, the specialist isn't guilty because he didn't agree to the conspiracy and didn't participate in the attempt. He just gave info, which might not be enough for aiding and abetting. So the two men are guilty of conspiracy and attempted, and the specialist isn't guilty. So the answer would be H.

The two men agreed to commit burglary, forming a conspiracy. They also took a substantial step towards the crime by going to the home, which constitutes an attempt. The alarm specialist provided information on disarming the alarm but refused to participate further. Since he did not agree to the conspiracy and did not directly participate in the attempt, he is not guilty of conspiracy or aiding and abetting the attempt. Therefore, the two men are guilty of both conspiracy and attempted burglary, while the specialist is not guilty of any crime.

**Answer: H**
