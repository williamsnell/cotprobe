Question:

A 20-year-old man has had frequent upper respiratory tract infections over the past 4 years. He has daily purulent sputum and has noted decreased exercise tolerance over the past 2 years. He and his wife have been unable to conceive because of his low sperm count. Scattered expiratory wheezing and rhonchi are heard throughout both lung fields. An x-ray of the chest shows hyperinflation. Spirometry shows a decreased FEV1:FVC ratio. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?

Options:

A: Bronchoscopy
B: Examination of sputum for eosinophils
C: Sputum cytology
D: Sweat chloride test
E: Chest CT scan
F: Echocardiogram
G: Spirometry repeat test
H: Tuberculin skin test
I: Complete blood count
J: Arterial blood gas analysis

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a patient with respiratory issues. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The patient is a 20-year-old man who's had frequent upper respiratory infections for four years. He has daily purulent sputum, which means he's coughing up yellow or green mucus. He also mentions decreased exercise tolerance over the past two years. His wife is having trouble conceiving because of his low sperm count. 

On physical exam, he has scattered expiratory wheezing and rhonchi in both lung fields. The chest X-ray shows hyperinflation, which suggests his lungs are over-inflated. The spirometry results show a decreased FEV1:FVC ratio. 

I remember that FEV1 is the forced expiratory volume in one second, and FVC is the forced vital capacity. A decreased FEV1:FVC ratio usually indicates an obstructive lung disease because the patient can't exhale quickly enough. Conditions like asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or maybe cystic fibrosis come to mind. 

Looking at the symptoms: frequent URIs, sputum production, wheezing, and hyperinflation on X-ray. These all point towards something like asthma or COPD. But the patient is young, and COPD usually affects older smokers. He's been having symptoms for four years, though. 

The low sperm count could be due to various factors. In cystic fibrosis, males often have issues with their reproductive system, including a condition called congenital bilateral varocele, which can lead to infertility. So maybe CF is a possibility here. 

The options given are various tests. Let's go through them one by one. 

Option A: Bronchoscopy. That's a procedure where they look into the lungs with a scope. It's used to check for infections, inflammation, or tumors. But in this case, the symptoms are more consistent with a chronic condition rather than something that would require a scope. 

Option B: Examination of sputum for eosinophils. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell often seen in allergic conditions like asthma. If his sputum has a lot of eosinophils, that might suggest asthma. 

Option C: Sputum cytology. This looks for abnormal cells, which would be more relevant for cancer, not something like asthma or CF. 

Option D: Sweat chloride test. This is used to diagnose cystic fibrosis. People with CF have high levels of chloride in their sweat. If the patient has CF, this test would confirm it. 

Option E: Chest CT scan. It provides more detailed images than X-rays. It can show things like emphysema or structural changes. But we might not need it if another test can confirm the diagnosis. 

Option F: Echocardiogram. This looks at heart function. If there's pulmonary hypertension, the heart might be affected, but that's more of a later complication. 

Option G: Spirometry repeat test. He already did spirometry, and the ratio is decreased. Repeating it might not change the diagnosis unless there's variability. 

Option H: Tuberculin skin test. For checking TB, but the symptoms don't point towards TB. 

Option I: Complete blood count. Could show infection or inflammation, but not specific enough. 

Option J: Arterial blood gas analysis. This shows oxygen and carbon dioxide levels. It can indicate if there's hypoxia or hypercapnia, but again, not a confirmatory test for the underlying condition. 

Putting it all together: The patient has symptoms pointing towards asthma or CF. The low sperm count and daily sputum suggest CF. The decreased FEV1:FVC ratio supports an obstructive disease. The sweat chloride test (Option D) is the gold standard for confirming CF. 

So the most likely answer is D.

The patient's symptoms, including frequent respiratory infections, daily purulent sputum, wheezing, hyperinflation on X-ray, and a decreased FEV1:FVC ratio, suggest an obstructive lung disease. His young age and infertility point towards cystic fibrosis (CF), especially since CF can cause both respiratory issues and male infertility. The sweat chloride test is the definitive diagnostic tool for CF. 

Answer: D
