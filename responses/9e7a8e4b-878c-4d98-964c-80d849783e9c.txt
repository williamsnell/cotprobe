Okay, so I've got this question about organizational structures and specialization. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking which organizational structure is characterized by specialization. The options are A to J. Hmm, I remember that organizational structures vary based on how tasks and authority are divided.

First, let's recall what each structure entails. Specialization usually refers to employees having expertise in specific areas. So the structure that emphasizes this would have clear divisions of labor.

Option A: Hierarchical. This is a traditional top-down structure with clear levels. While it has hierarchy, I'm not sure if it's specifically about specialization. It's more about authority levels.

Option B: Network. This structure relies on external partners and might not have a strong focus on specialization within the organization itself.

Option C: Functional. This one organizes employees by specific functions like marketing, HR, etc. Each department has specialists, so this seems like a fit. Functional structures do rely on specialization because each team focuses on their area.

Option D: Flat. This has few levels of management and emphasizes decentralization. Not sure if it's about specialization. It's more about simplicity and communication.

Option E: Decentralized. This means decision-making is spread out, not necessarily about specialization.

Option F: Divisional. Divisions might be product or market-focused, each acting like a separate entity. They might have their own specialists, but the structure itself is divisional rather than specialized per se.

Option G: Matrix. This combines functional and project-based structures, which can lead to dual reporting. It's more about handling complex projects but may not specifically emphasize specialization.

Option H: Horizontal. Not a term I'm familiar with in standard organizational structures, so probably not relevant here.

Option I: Multi-divisional. Similar to divisional, but with multiple divisions. Again, each division might have specialists, but the structure isn't specialized itself.

Option J: Centralized. This is about decisions being made at the top, not directly about specialization.

So putting it together, the functional structure (C) is organized by specialized functions, so it's likely the answer. Each department has experts in their field, which aligns with specialization. The divisional structure (F) might also have specialists, but the question is about the structure that features specialization as a key aspect. Functional structure is more directly associated with it.
