Okay, so I have this question about quasi species viruses, like influenza and HIV. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me start by recalling what I know about quasi species.

Quasi species are a concept in virology where a population of viruses with a high mutation rate exists as a mix of different but closely related genetic variants. Unlike a traditional species, which has a stable genome, quasi species are a collection of variants that coexist and can change over time. This is important because it allows the virus to adapt quickly to different conditions, like宿主 defenses or vaccines.

Now, looking at the options provided:

A: Possesses only RNA. Hmm, both influenza and HIV have RNA, but I think influenza is an RNA virus, while HIV is as well. But wait, I'm not sure if all quasi species viruses are RNA-only. Maybe some have DNA? Well, the question specifies quasi species like influenza and HIV, which are both RNA viruses, so A might be a possible answer. But I'm not certain if the characteristic of being a quasi species is tied to just RNA or if it's more about the genetic diversity.

B: Stable and unchanging genome. No, that doesn't make sense because quasi species are known for their high mutation rates. So B is probably incorrect.

C: Possesses only DNA. No, both influenza and HIV have RNA, so this can't be right.

D: Single, unsegmented genome. Influenza has a segmented genome, I believe. Its RNA is in multiple segments, while HIV has a single-stranded RNA genome. So D might not be correct because not all quasi species viruses have a single, unsegmented genome.

E: RNA and DNA. That would be something like a retrovirus, which HIV is, but I'm not sure if this relates to the quasi species characteristic. The question is about the characteristic of being a quasi species, not the type of nucleic acid.

F: Very large genome. I don't think that's a defining feature. Both influenza and HIV have relatively smaller genomes compared to, say, herpesviruses.

G: Fragmented or segmented genome. Influenza has a segmented genome, but HIV doesn't. So G might not be the right choice because not all quasi species viruses have this.

H: Co-existence of innumerable genetic variants. This sounds exactly like what quasi species are. They exist as a mix of many variants, which allows them to adapt and evolve quickly. So H seems like the correct answer.

I: Cannot mutate or evolve. No, that's the opposite of quasi species, which mutate a lot.

J: Only exists in one form or variant. Again, the opposite of quasi species, which have many variants.

So putting it all together, the key characteristic is the co-existence of many genetic variants, which is option H.

The correct answer is H: Co-existence of innumerable genetic variants.

Answer: H
