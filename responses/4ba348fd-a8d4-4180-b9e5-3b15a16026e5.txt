Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about ring theory and polynomial rings. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work through each statement step by step.

First, let me read the question carefully. It presents two statements and asks me to evaluate each as true or false. The options are combinations of the evaluations for each statement.

Statement 1: If R is a ring and f(x) and g(x) are in R[x], then deg(f(x) + g(x)) equals the maximum of deg(f(x)) and deg(g(x)).

Hmm. I remember that in polynomial rings, when you add two polynomials, the degree of the sum is typically the maximum of their degrees, provided that the leading coefficients don't cancel each other out. But wait, that depends on the ring R. If R is a ring where the leading coefficients could add to zero, then the degree of the sum could be less than the maximum.

For example, suppose R is the ring of integers modulo 2, which is a field, actually. Let’s take f(x) = x and g(x) = x in R[x]. Then f(x) + g(x) = 2x, which is 0 in R[x] because 2 is 0 mod 2. So the sum becomes the zero polynomial, which has degree undefined or sometimes considered as -∞. But in some conventions, the degree of the zero polynomial is not defined, but in others, it's treated as -∞. So in this case, the degree of the sum is less than both original degrees (which were 1). So Statement 1 isn't always true.

Wait, but in general, for arbitrary rings, it's possible that the leading terms could cancel. So Statement 1 isn't necessarily true in all rings. So Statement 1 is False.

Wait, but wait another thought. The degree is defined as the highest degree with a non-zero coefficient. So if the leading coefficients add to zero, then the next highest degree would be considered. So in that case, the degree could be lower than the maximum.

So, for example, if I have f(x) = x + 1 and g(x) = -x in the ring of integers. Then f(x) + g(x) = (x - x) + 1 = 1, which is degree 0. The original degrees were 1 and 1, so the sum's degree is 0, which is less than the maximum. So yes, Statement 1 is not always true. Therefore, Statement 1 is False.

Now, moving on to Statement 2: If F is a field, then every ideal of F[x] is principal.

I recall that F[x] is a principal ideal domain (PID) when F is a field. That's a theorem. In a PID, every ideal is generated by a single element, so every ideal is principal. So Statement 2 is True.

Wait, but wait another thought. F[x] is a PID, correct. So every ideal is principal. So Statement 2 is True.

So putting it together, Statement 1 is False, and Statement 2 is True. Now, looking at the options, where each option gives the evaluation for Statement 1 and then Statement 2.

Looking at the options:

A: False, Not Determined
B: Not Determined, Not Determined
C: Not Determined, True
D: True, Not Determined
E: True, True
F: True, False
G: False, True
H: Not Determined, False
I: True, Not Applicable
J: False, False

So, our conclusion is Statement 1 is False, Statement 2 is True. So the corresponding option is G: False, True.

Wait, but did I make a mistake with Statement 1? Let me double-check.

In the first example, I took R = Z/2Z, f(x) = x, g(x) = x. Then f+g = 0, which is the zero polynomial, whose degree is undefined. But in some contexts, the degree is considered as -∞, which would be less than the original degrees (1). So in that case, the degree is less than the maximum. So the statement that the degree is the maximum is not always true. Hence, Statement 1 is False.

Yes, so I think I was correct. So the answer should be G: False, True.

The first statement is False because the degree of the sum of two polynomials in an arbitrary ring R[x] can be less than the maximum of their degrees if their leading coefficients cancel out. The second statement is True because when F is a field, F[x] is a principal ideal domain, meaning every ideal is principal.

Answer: G
