Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the shortest path from node 1 to node 6 in this undirected graph G. Let me start by understanding the graph structure based on the edges provided.

The edges are E = {<1,2>, <2,4>, <5,4>, <5,6>}. So, each edge connects two nodes. Let me visualize this:

- Node 1 is connected to node 2.
- Node 2 is connected to node 4.
- Node 4 is connected to node 5.
- Node 5 is connected to node 6.

So, the connections look like this: 1-2-4-5-6. Also, there's a direct connection from 5 to 6, which is good.

I need to find the shortest path from 1 to 6. The options given are various paths, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me list out the possible paths.

First, the direct path if it exists. From 1, you can go to 2. From 2, you can go to 4. From 4, you can go to 5. From 5, you can go to 6. So that's 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6. That's a path of length 4 steps, right? So the path would be [1,2,4,5,6], which I think is option C.

Wait, but are there any shorter paths? Let me check. Is there a way to get from 1 to 6 in fewer steps?

Looking at the edges again: 1 is connected only to 2. So from 1, the only first step is to 2. Then from 2, connected to 4. From 4, connected to 5. From 5, connected to 6. So that's the path I have.

Alternatively, is there another way? Let me see: From 1 to 2, then 2 to 4, 4 to 5, and 5 to 6. No other branches or shortcuts. Because node 2 is only connected to 1 and 4. Node 4 is connected to 2,5. Node 5 is connected to 4 and 6. So the only way is through 1-2-4-5-6.

So the path is [1,2,4,5,6], which is option C.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option C is [1,2,4,5,6], which is 5 nodes, 4 edges, so length 4. Are there any shorter paths? Let me think: is there a way to get from 1 to 6 in 3 steps? That would require a path of 4 nodes, like 1-2-4-5-6 is 5 nodes, which is 4 steps. So 4 is the minimum.

Wait, no, wait. Another thought: Could there be a path from 1-2-4-5-6, which is 4 steps, or is there a way to get to 6 in fewer steps? Let me see. From 1 to 2 (1 step). From 2, can I reach 5 directly? No, because 2 is connected to 4, not 5. So from 2, the next is 4, then from 4 to 5, then 5 to 6. So that's 4 steps. So the path is indeed [1,2,4,5,6], which is option C.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is [1,2,4,6], which would imply a direct connection from 4 to 6. But according to the edges, 4 is connected only to 2 and 5. So 4 and 6 are not directly connected. So option J is not possible.

Option A is [1,5,4,6], but 1 is only connected to 2, so you can't go from 1 to 5 directly. So option A is invalid.

Option E is [1,2,5,6], but from 2, you can't go directly to 5. Wait, no, 2 is connected to 4, and 4 is connected to 5. So from 2, you can go to 4, then to 5, then to 6. So that's the correct path. Option E is [1,2,5,6], but that would mean 2 is connected directly to 5, which it's not. So that's incorrect.

So the correct path is option C: [1,2,4,5,6].

The shortest path from node 1 to node 6 in the given undirected graph is [1, 2, 4, 5, 6], which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
