Okay, so I've got this question about different ethnic groups and their experiences with shame and guilt when admitting to a family problem in counseling. The options are from A to G, each representing a different group. I need to figure out which one is the correct answer.

First, the question is asking which group commonly experiences intense feelings of shame and guilt upon admitting a family problem to a counselor. The options are A: Eastern European-Americans, B: Asian-Americans, C: African-Americans, D: Native North Americans, E: European-Americans, F: Hispanics, G: Caribbean-Americans.

I remember from psychology classes that different cultures have varying attitudes towards mental health and seeking help. Some cultures might have more stigma around mental health issues, which could lead to feelings of shame when discussing personal problems.

Let me think about each option. 

Option B is Asian-Americans. I've heard that some Asian cultures emphasize family honor and may have strong social norms against discussing personal or family problems openly. This could lead to higher feelings of shame when admitting such issues to an outsider like a counselor.

Option E is European-Americans. European cultures, especially in the US, are more individualistic and might be more accepting of discussing personal issues. So maybe they wouldn't experience as much shame or guilt.

Option F is Hispanics. Hispanic cultures often value family very highly, but I'm not sure how they compare to Asian-Americans in terms of stigma around counseling. It might be high, but I'm not certain.

Option G is Caribbean-Americans. Similar to Hispanics, they come from cultures where family is important, but again, I'm not sure about the specifics regarding counseling and shame.

Options A, C, D: Eastern European-Americans, African-Americans, and Native North Americans. I don't recall specific information about these groups in this context, so maybe they're less likely.

I think Asian-Americans are more likely to experience shame because of the cultural emphasis on saving face and not revealing family issues publicly. So when someone admits to a counselor, they might feel a lot of guilt and shame because it's seen as a personal or family failure.

Therefore, the answer is B: Asian-Americans.
