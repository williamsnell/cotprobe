Question:

A professional football player was seriously injured when the football helmet he was wearing shattered as he was being tackled during a game. The player subsequently asserted a claim against the manufacturer of the helmet to recover damages for his injury. At trial, the player's attorney calls a former employee of the manufacturer to testify that three weeks after the player suffered his injury, the manufacturer devised a new design for its football helmets. The former employee's testimony is

Options:

A: inadmissible, because the former employee is no longer authorized to speak on behalf of the manufacturer.
B: admissible as an admission.
C: inadmissible, because of the public policy behind taking safety precautions.
D: admissible as evidence that the manufacturer knew the helmet was defective.
E: admissible, because the former employee has firsthand knowledge of the manufacturer's actions.
F: inadmissible, because the testimony is prejudicial to the manufacturer.
G: admissible as direct evidence that the player's injury was caused by the defective design of the football helmet.
H: inadmissible, because the testimony is hearsay.
I: inadmissible, because the testimony is irrelevant to the case.
J: admissible as circumstantial evidence that the player's injury was traceable to the defective design of the football helmet.

Okay, so I've got this question about evidence law, specifically dealing with the admissibility of a former employee's testimony in a products liability case. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The scenario is that a football player was injured because his helmet shattered during a tackle. He's suing the manufacturer. At trial, the player's attorney calls a former employee of the manufacturer to testify. The testimony is about the manufacturer coming up with a new helmet design three weeks after the injury.

The question is about whether this testimony is admissible and, if so, under what exception. The options are A through J.

First, I need to recall the rules about hearsay and exceptions. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. If the former employee is testifying about what the manufacturer did (the new design), that might be hearsay unless an exception applies.

One of the exceptions is admissions by a party opponent. Admissions are statements offered against an opposing party that are made by the party's agent or employee on a matter within their authority, and while employed. So, if the former employee was testifying about something the manufacturer did, like developing a new design, that could be an admission.

But wait, the employee is no longer with the company. Does that matter? Admissions can still be admissible even if the declarant is no longer with the company because the key is that the statement was made by someone acting on behalf of the company at the time.

So the employee's testimony about the manufacturer's new design three weeks after the injury would be an admission by a party opponent. This would be relevant because it could show that the manufacturer knew the helmet was defective or needed improvement, which could support the plaintiff's case.

Looking at the options:

Option B says admissible as an admission. That sounds right.

Other options: Option H says inadmissible as hearsay, but the admission exception would make it admissible, so H would be incorrect.

Option E says admissible because of firsthand knowledge. The employee does have firsthand knowledge, but the key reason for admissibility here is that it's an admission, not just firsthand knowledge. Plus, the testimony's content is about the manufacturer's subsequent actions, which is relevant to knowledge of defect.

Option D and J talk about causation, but the testimony is more about the manufacturer's knowledge, not directly proving the design defect caused the injury. So those might not be the best fit.

Option I says irrelevant, but the new design could show the manufacturer recognized a defect, making it relevant. So I is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be B: admissible as an admission.

The testimony is admissible as an admission by a party opponent, as the former employee's statement about the manufacturer's actions falls under the admission exception to hearsay. 

Answer: B
