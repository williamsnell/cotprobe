Okay, so I need to figure out which of the options correctly represents 270,240 in expanded form. Let me start by breaking down the number digit by digit from left to right.

The number is 270,240. Let's write it out as 2 7 0 2 4 0. Each digit corresponds to a place value: hundred thousands, ten thousands, thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones.

Starting from the left:
- The first digit is 2, which is in the hundred thousands place. So that's 200,000.
- The second digit is 7, in the ten thousands place. That makes 70,000.
- The third digit is 0, so that's nothing. So we skip the thousands place.
- The fourth digit is 2, which is in the thousands place. That gives 2,000.
- The fifth digit is 4, in the hundreds place, so that's 400.
- The last digit is 0, so that's nothing in the tens place.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the number is 270,240. Let me check again. Breaking it down:

200,000 (from the first digit)
+70,000 (second digit)
+0 (third digit, which is in thousands place, so 0)
+200 (fourth digit, which is in hundreds place? Wait, no, the fourth digit is 2, but where is it placed?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me write the number in expanded form step by step.

270,240 can be broken down as:
- 2 * 100,000 = 200,000
- 7 * 10,000 = 70,000
- 0 * 1,000 = 0
- 2 * 100 = 200
- 4 * 10 = 40
- 0 * 1 = 0

So adding those up, we get 200,000 + 70,000 + 200 + 40.

Now looking at the options:

Option A: 200,000 +70,000 +2,000 +400 → Wait, 2,000 and 400 would come from digits in thousands and hundreds places, but in our breakdown, the thousands digit is 0 and the hundreds digit is 2, so 200. So option A is incorrect because it adds 2,000 and 400 instead.

Option B: 200,000 +70,000 +200 +40 → That matches exactly what I have: 200k +70k +200 +40. So that's correct.

Option C: 200,000 +70,000 +200 +400 → Again, 400 instead of 40, so incorrect.

Option D: 200,000 +70,000 +2,400 → 2,400 would imply the thousands digit is 2 and hundreds is 4, but in our case, it's 2 in hundreds place, so 200, and 4 in tens, so 40. So D is wrong.

Option E: 200,000 +70,000 +2,000 +40 → Wait, 2,000 here. But in our breakdown, the thousands place is 0, so that shouldn't be there. So E is incorrect.

Option F: 200,000 +7,000 +200 +4 → 7,000 is way too low. The second digit is 7 in ten thousands place, so it should be 70,000, not 7,000. So F is wrong.

Option G: 200,000 +7,000 +200 +40 → Same issue as F; the second term is wrong.

Option H: 200,000 +70,000 +20,000 +40 → 20,000 would come from a 2 in the ten thousands place, but the third digit is 0, so no. So H is incorrect.

Option I: 270,000 +200 +40 → 270,000 is more than our original number. Wait, 270,000 is 270k, and our number is 270,240. So 270k is part of it, but then we add 200 and 40, making it 270,240. Wait, 270,000 + 200 +40 equals 270,240. So is option I correct? But wait, in expanded form, each digit is expressed as the digit times its place value. So 270,000 is 2*100,000 +7*10,000 +0*1,000. So including that as a single term is acceptable in expanded form, but the rest should be broken down. So option I is 270,000 +200 +40, which adds up correctly. But I'm not sure if that's the standard way. Typically, expanded form breaks each digit, so 2*100k +7*10k +0*1k +2*100 +4*10 +0*1. So the correct expanded form would include each non-zero digit. So option I is 270,000 +200 +40, which is correct but more concise. But I'm not sure if that's considered expanded form. Some might require each digit to be explicitly broken down, so maybe option B is better.

Wait, the question is about expanded form. Expanded form typically shows each digit as a separate term. So 270,240 would be 200,000 +70,000 +200 +40. So option B matches that. Option I combines 270,000, which is 200,000+70,000, but then adds 200 and 40. So it's a more compressed version. So perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but in the options, option I is 270,000 +200 +40, which sums correctly to 270,240. So is that a valid expanded form? Maybe, but I think the standard expanded form breaks it down into each place value, so each digit is represented. So in that case, the correct answer would be B, because I includes 270,000 as a single term, which combines two place values.

Wait, but let me confirm. Expanded form usually shows each digit's value. So 270,240 would be 200,000 +70,000 +200 +40. So option B is correct.

The correct expanded form of 270,240 is 200,000 + 70,000 + 200 + 40, which corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
