Okay, so I've got this question here: If Christmas Day is on a Saturday, then what day of the week is the following New Year's Day? The options are from A to G, with each letter corresponding to a day. I'm a bit rusty on my calendar calculations, but I'll try to work through this step by step.

First, I know that Christmas Day is December 25th. If that's a Saturday, then I need to figure out what day January 1st falls on. Since December has 31 days, I can calculate the number of days between December 25th and December 31st, and then see how that affects the days of the week.

Wait, actually, from December 25th to December 31st is 6 days because December 25th is included as day 1. So, 25th is Saturday, 26th Sunday, 27th Monday, 28th Tuesday, 29th Wednesday, 30th Thursday, and 31st Friday. That's 7 days, but since we're starting on the 25th, the next day is the 26th. So from the 25th (Saturday) to the 31st (Friday), that's 6 days after Saturday. Wait, no, that's 6 days after the 25th, which would make the 31st a Friday. Let me count again: 25 (Sat), 26 (Sun), 27 (Mon), 28 (Tue), 29 (Wed), 30 (Thu), 31 (Fri). So yes, 7 days from the 25th would bring us to the 1st of January. Wait, no, because December has 31 days, so the next day after December 31st is January 1st.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me approach this differently. If December 25th is a Saturday, then December 26th is Sunday, 27th Monday, 28th Tuesday, 29th Wednesday, 30th Thursday, 31st Friday. So December 31st is a Friday. Then January 1st is the day after, which would be Saturday. So New Year's Day is a Saturday. But wait, that can't be right because December has 31 days, so from December 25th to December 31st is 6 days, meaning 6 days after Saturday would be Friday. Wait, no, because the 25th is day 0 (Saturday), then day 1 is Sunday (26th), day 2 Monday (27th), day 3 Tuesday (28th), day 4 Wednesday (29th), day 5 Thursday (30th), day 6 Friday (31st). So December 31st is Friday. Therefore, January 1st is Saturday. So the answer would be F: Saturday.

Wait, but that seems a bit off. Let me check again. If Christmas is on Saturday (Dec 25), then the next day is Dec 26 (Sunday). Let's count the days from Dec 25 to Jan 1. From Dec 25 to Dec 31 is 7 days, including the 25th. So Dec 31 is 6 days after Dec 25. So 6 days after Saturday is Friday (because Saturday + 1 is Sunday, +2 Monday, +3 Tuesday, +4 Wednesday, +5 Thursday, +6 Friday). So Dec 31 is Friday, so Jan 1 is Saturday. Yeah, that makes sense. So the answer should be F: Saturday.

The answer is F: Saturday.
