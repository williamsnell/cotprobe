Okay, so I need to find the area of an equilateral triangle with sides of 12 inches. Hmm, I remember that the formula for the area of a triangle is generally (base * height)/2, but since it's an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal and there's a specific formula for that.

Wait, right, the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is (√3/4) multiplied by the side squared. So, the formula would be Area = (√3/4) * a², where 'a' is the length of a side. 

Let me plug in the numbers. The side is 12 inches, so a squared is 12 * 12, which is 144. Then I multiply that by √3 and then divide by 4. 

So, the calculation would be (√3 * 144) / 4. Let me compute that step by step. First, 144 divided by 4 is 36. So now it's √3 multiplied by 36. 

I know that √3 is approximately 1.732. So, 36 * 1.732. Let me calculate that. 36 * 1.7 is 61.2, and 36 * 0.032 is about 1.152. Adding those together gives 61.2 + 1.152 = 62.352. 

Wait, but that seems a bit low. Did I do that right? Let me check again. Oh wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Because 36 * 1.732 is actually higher than that. Let me compute it properly: 36 times 1 is 36, 36 times 0.7 is 25.2, 36 times 0.03 is 1.08, and 36 times 0.002 is 0.072. Adding those: 36 + 25.2 is 61.2, plus 1.08 is 62.28, plus 0.072 is 62.352. Hmm, that's the same result. So the area is approximately 62.352 square inches.

Looking at the options, the closest one is G: 62. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might mix up the steps. Alternatively, maybe I should use a more precise value of √3 to get a better approximation. The exact value of √3 is about 1.73205.

So, 36 * 1.73205 = let's compute it accurately. 36 times 1 is 36. 36 times 0.7 is 25.2, 36 times 0.03 is 1.08, 36 times 0.00205 is approximately 0.0738. Adding all together: 36 + 25.2 = 61.2, +1.08 = 62.28, +0.0738 ≈ 62.3538. So, still around 62.35.

Wait, but another thought: maybe I should have considered that sometimes the formula is presented differently, but no, I think I used it correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the height of the triangle and then use the standard area formula. Let me try that approach to cross-verify.

In an equilateral triangle, the height can be calculated by splitting the triangle into two 30-60-90 right triangles. The height (h) can be found using Pythagoras' theorem: h² + (a/2)² = a². So, h² + (6)² = 12². That gives h² + 36 = 144, so h² = 108. Therefore, h = √108. Simplify √108: √(36*3) = 6√3. So, h = 6√3 inches.

Then, the area is (base * height)/2. Base is 12, height is 6√3. So, area = (12 * 6√3)/2. Simplify: 12/2 is 6, so 6 * 6√3 = 36√3. Which is the same as before. Then, 36√3 is approximately 36 * 1.732 ≈ 62.352. So yes, that confirms the area is approximately 62.35 square inches.

Looking back at the options, option G is 62, which is the closest to 62.35. So the answer should be G. But wait, let me check if I missed any other options. The options are A:142, B:52, C:102, D:112, E:84, F:122, G:62, H:72, I:132, J:92. So yes, G is 62, which is the closest to my calculated value.

But wait, another thing: sometimes in multiple-choice questions, they might round to the nearest whole number or use a different approximation for √3. For example, if they approximate √3 as 1.732, then 36 * 1.732 is 62.352, which rounds to 62. So G is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should verify if I used the correct formula. Another way: area of a triangle is ½ * base * height. So using base 12, height 6√3, which gives ½ * 12 * 6√3 = 6 * 6√3 = 36√3. So that's correct.

The area of an equilateral triangle with side length 12 inches is calculated using the formula \( \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times a^2 \), where \( a = 12 \). This gives \( \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 144 \approx 62.35 \), which rounds to 62. Therefore, the closest option is G.
