Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the order of payment for bonds, common stock, and preferred stock in the event of bankruptcy. Hmm, I remember that in bankruptcy, the order of who gets paid first is based on the hierarchy of claims. 

I think bondholders are usually higher priority because they're debt holders. They lend money to the company, so when the company goes bankrupt, they get paid back before shareholders. But wait, what about preferred stock versus common stock? I believe preferred stockholders have a higher claim than common stockholders because preferred stock is like a hybrid between debt and equity. So, preferred stockholders should get paid before common stockholders.

Putting it together, the order should be bondholders first because they're debtors, then preferred stockholders, and lastly common stockholders. Let me look at the options again.

Option I says Bondholders, preferred stockholders, then common stockholders. That matches what I was thinking. Option I seems correct.

The order of payment in bankruptcy is determined by the hierarchy of claims. Bondholders, being debt holders, are paid first. Preferred stockholders come next as they have a higher claim than common stockholders. Thus, the correct order is bondholders, preferred stockholders, then common stockholders.
