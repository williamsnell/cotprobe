Question:

In summer squash, spheroid fruit genes are dominant over genes for elongated fruit. A cross between two different homozygous spheroid-fruited varieties results in the following F_2: 89 disc62 spheroid11elongated Ascertain the fit of this data to a reasonable modified dihybrid ratio using chi-square analysis. Explain the pattern of inheritance, the F_1 genotype and phenotype, and the F_2 genotypes .

Options:

A: The pattern of inheritance is codominance at one locus and complete dominance at the other.
B: The data fits a 15:1 ratio, suggesting that one gene is completely dominant over the other and that there is no interaction between genes.
C: The data fits a 3:1 ratio

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem about summer squash and their fruit shapes. Let's see what the question says.

So, the problem states that in summer squash, the spheroid fruit gene is dominant over the elongated one. They crossed two different homozygous spheroid varieties, which I think means both are spheroid and probably have the same genotype, like SS x SS. Wait, but wait—if they're homozygous for spheroid, then their F1 should also be spheroid, right? Because both parents are SS (assuming S is the dominant allele for spheroid), so F1 would be SS, showing spheroid.

Then, when they self the F1, the F2 generation shows a certain ratio: 89 are spheroid and 62 are elongated. Hmm, that's two phenotypes. Wait, but I thought a dihybrid cross usually gives more than two phenotypes. Oh wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. Let me read again.

Wait, the cross is between two homozygous spheroid varieties. So if they're both SS, their F1 would be SS. Then selfing F1 would produce F2. But wait, if F2 has 89 spheroid and 62 elongated, that's a ratio of roughly 89:62. Let me calculate the ratio: 89+62=151. So 89/151 is about 0.59, and 62/151 is about 0.41. Hmm, that's roughly a 1.2:0.62 ratio. Wait, 89 is about 1.4 times 62, but that's not a standard ratio I'm familiar with.

Wait, but the options given are about modified dihybrid ratios. A dihybrid cross usually gives a 9:3:3:1 ratio in F2 when two independent traits are involved. But here, the F2 is only two phenotypes, so maybe it's a case where the two genes interact in some way, leading to fewer phenotypes.

Let me think about possible gene interactions. One possibility is epistasis, where one gene affects the expression of another. For example, dominant epistasis (like in the case of coat color in some animals) where the presence of a dominant allele at one locus masks the expression of the other.

If the F2 ratio is 89 spheroid and 62 elongated, that's a total of 151. Let me see what the actual expected ratio would be if there's epistasis. For dominant epistasis, a common ratio is 12:3:1, but wait, that's three phenotypes. Alternatively, maybe it's a 9:6:1 ratio, but that's also three. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a 15:1 ratio, which would come from a situation where only the recessive at one locus allows the other locus to be expressed. Let's see: 15:1 would mean 15 parts of one phenotype to 1 part of another. 15+1=16, so 15/16 and 1/16. But our observed is 89 and 62, which adds up to 151. Let me see: 89 is about 15 parts and 62 is about 1 part if 151 ≈ 16 parts. Wait, 15 parts would be (15/16) * 151 ≈ 144. So that doesn't match 89. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a 3:1 ratio. 3+1=4. 3/4 is 113.25, which is close to 89? No, 89 is about 59% of 151, which is closer to 0.6, not 0.75. So 3:1 is 75:25, but 89 is more than 75% of 151. So that's not matching.

Wait, the observed data is 89 spheroid (let's say S) and 62 elongated (s). So S is more frequent. Let me think about what could lead to a 89:62 ratio. Let me compute the ratio as 89:62 ≈ 1.435:1.

Wait, perhaps it's a case where two dominant alleles are required for spheroid. Like, maybe the phenotype is determined by the presence of at least two dominant alleles. But that doesn't make sense because the parents are both SS, so F1 is SS, and F2 would be all SS except when there's a mutation, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the gene affects the shape in a way that involves two loci. Let's say, for example, that the spheroid shape is expressed only when at least one dominant allele is present at each of two loci. So, for example, maybe the fruit shape is spheroid only if both loci have at least one dominant allele. If either locus is homozygous recessive, the fruit is elongated.

If that's the case, the F2 would have phenotypes based on the combination of two loci. Let's model this.

Assuming the F1 is SsTt (if two loci are involved), then the F2 would be all possible combinations from a dihybrid cross. The number of spheroid would be those with at least S_ and T_ (since both loci need to have dominant alleles). So the spheroid phenotype would be the cases where both loci are dominant. The number of such cases would be the sum of the dihybrid ratios where both are dominant.

Wait, in a dihybrid cross, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. The 9 are those where both are dominant (S_T_), the 3 are S_ttt (if that's possible), but wait, each locus has its own dominance. Alternatively, if spheroid requires both loci to have dominant alleles, then the spheroid phenotype would be only in the 9 cases (S_T_), and the rest (3 + 3 +1 =7) would be elongated. So the ratio would be 9:7. But 9+7=16. Let's see: 9/16 is 0.5625. The observed ratio is 89+62=151. 89/151 ≈0.59, which is close to 9/16 (≈0.56). Hmm, but not exactly. Also, 9:7 would mean 9 spheroid and 7 elongated in 16 total. So in 151, 9/16 *151≈88.1, and 7/16≈62.8. That's very close to the observed 89 and 62. So the ratio is approximately 9:7, which fits the 9:7 dihybrid ratio when two genes are involved and the phenotype requires both dominant alleles for spheroid.

But wait, the options don't mention a 9:7 ratio. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 9:6:1 ratio with 90% probability. Complete dominance at both loci. Interaction between two dominants produces a new disc phenotype.

Option E: 12:3:1 ratio indicating dominant epistasis.

Option F: 9:3:3:1, typical dihybrid.

Option B: 15:1 ratio, no interaction.

Option D says 9:6:1 with 90% probability. But 9:6:1 is another ratio (like in the case of duplicate dominant epistasis). Let me think: 9:6:1 is the ratio when the presence of at least one dominant allele at both loci produces one phenotype, and the others produce another. Wait, no, 9:6:1 is when two loci interact in a way that produces three phenotypes. For example, when both loci are dominant, you get phenotype A, when only one is dominant you get phenotype B, and when both are recessive you get phenotype C. So 9:6:1.

But in our case, we only have two phenotypes. So perhaps the data doesn't fit 9:6:1 because that's a three-phenotype ratio. So maybe the correct answer is not D.

Wait, but the observed data has two phenotypes, so perhaps the interaction leads to only two phenotypes. Let me think again.

If the cross is between two homozygous spheroid varieties, but perhaps they're not the same genotype. Wait, the problem says "two different homozygous spheroid-fruited varieties." So maybe the parents are SS (spheroid) and S'S' (another genotype for spheroid, perhaps a different dominant allele). Wait, but that would complicate things if they're different loci. Or maybe the parents are SS and Ss, but no, they are homozygous.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify: the parents are homozygous spheroid, meaning they're both SS (assuming S is the dominant allele). So their F1 would be SS, which is spheroid. Then F1 selfing would produce F2. But if F2 has spheroid and elongated, that implies some segregation. Wait, that can't be because if F1 is SS, then F2 would all be SS, but that's not possible because in reality, F1 would be SS, and F2 would be all SS, which can't produce any elongated. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the cross.

Wait, maybe the cross isn't a selfing but a cross between two different homozygous spheroid varieties. For example, one is SS and the other is Ss (but that's not homozygous), so that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the two parents are homozygous for different alleles at two loci that affect the shape. Wait, maybe the cross is between two different homozygous spheroid strains, each homozygous for different alleles at two loci. For example, one parent is SS at locus A and aa at locus B, and the other is aa at A and SS at B. But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross is between two homozygous spheroid plants, but each has different alleles at a single locus. For example, one is AA and the other is aa, but that doesn't make sense because AA and aa would have the same phenotype if A is dominant. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the initial cross is between two different homozygous spheroid varieties, each homozygous for different alleles at the same locus. But that would mean their F1 is heterozygous, and F2 would show a 3:1 ratio if it's a single gene. But the observed data is 89:62, which is roughly 1.4:1, not 3:1. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a dihybrid cross, and the F2 shows a modified ratio due to epistasis. Let me think about dominant epistasis. In dominant epistasis, the presence of a dominant allele at one locus masks the expression of the other locus. For example, let's say that gene A is required for the expression of gene B. So, if A is present (AA or Aa), then the phenotype depends on gene B. If A is recessive (aa), then the phenotype is fixed regardless of B.

In this case, perhaps the spheroid phenotype (S) requires a dominant allele at gene A, and another gene B determines the shape. So, if A is present (A_), then the phenotype depends on B: B_ gives spheroid, and bb gives elongated. If A is aa, then regardless of B, the phenotype is elongated.

So, in such a case, the F2 would have the following phenotypic ratios:

When A_ is present (probability 3/4), then B_ (probability 1/4) would give spheroid, and bb (3/4) would give elongated. Wait, no, because within A_, the B gene would determine the shape. So the total spheroid would be (prob of A_) * (prob of B_) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me model this properly.

Assume that gene A controls whether the shape is expressed. If A is present (A_), then the shape is determined by gene B: B_ gives spheroid, bb gives elongated. If A is aa, then the shape is elongated regardless of B.

So the possible genotypes and phenotypes would be:

- A_B_: spheroid
- A_b_: spheroid (since B_ includes Bb and bb, but wait no, because if A is present, then B determines the shape. Wait, no, if A is present, the shape depends on B. So A_B_ would be spheroid, and A_bb would be elongated.

Wait, no, if A is present, then B determines the shape. So:

- A_ B_: spheroid
- A_ bb: elongated
- aa __: elongated (regardless of B)

So the total spheroid would be (prob of A_) * (prob of B_) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.

The elongated would be (3/4)* (3/4) [A_ and bb] + (1/4)* [aa]. So 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16, plus 4/16 (since aa is 1/4 of the F2) = 13/16.

Wait, that can't be because 3/16 +13/16=16/16. But that would give a ratio of 3:13, which is about 0.19:0.68, but the observed is about 0.59:0.41, which is roughly 1.4:1.

Hmm, that's not matching. So maybe it's a different kind of epistasis.

Another possibility is recessive epistasis, where the presence of a dominant allele at one locus allows the other locus to be expressed. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of another approach.

The observed ratio is approximately 89:62, which is roughly 1.43:1. Let me see what possible ratios could fit this. Let's compute the exact ratio: 89/151 ≈0.589, and 62/151≈0.411.

Looking at the options, option E is 12:3:1, which is a three-phenotype ratio. But our data has only two phenotypes, so E is out.

Option D is 9:6:1, which is three phenotypes, so not matching.

Option B is 15:1, which is two phenotypes. 15+1=16. So 15/16 and 1/16. The observed is 89:62, which is about 1.43:1. 15:1 would be 15 parts spheroid to 1 part elongated. Let's see: 15/16 ≈0.9375, which is higher than 0.589. So that's not matching.

Option C is 3:1, which is 75:25. 3/4 is 0.75, which is higher than 0.589. Doesn't fit.

Option F is 9:3:3:1, which is four phenotypes, but we have two.

Option E is 12:3:1, which is three phenotypes.

Option H: Interaction between two recessive genes produces a new phenotype. That would suggest that when both are recessive, a new phenotype appears. But our data has two phenotypes, so perhaps when both are recessive, it's a different phenotype than the parents. But I'm not sure.

Option J suggests multiple alleles at one locus, which could complicate things, but I'm not sure.

Option A: Codominance at one locus and complete dominance at the other. That would mean two loci, but I'm not sure how that would affect the ratio.

Option G: Incomplete dominance at both loci. That would lead to more than two phenotypes, so not matching our data.

Option I: 1:2:1 ratio, which is three phenotypes, but our data has two.

So the only options left that involve two phenotypes are B (15:1) and perhaps D (9:6:1 is three, so no), and maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility is that the data fits a 9:7 ratio, which isn't listed as an option. 9:7 would involve two loci, with both dominant alleles needed for spheroid. So spheroid is 9 parts, and elongated is 7 parts. 9+7=16. 9/16 is 0.5625, which is close to the observed 0.589. So perhaps the data fits a 9:7 ratio, but this isn't one of the options.

Looking back at the options, none of them mention 9:7, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D, which states a 9:6:1 ratio with 90% probability, but that's a three-phenotype ratio. But the data here has only two phenotypes, so that doesn't fit. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps the two spheroid parents are not homozygous for the same alleles. For example, one parent is SS and the other is Ss (but that's not homozygous). Alternatively, perhaps the cross is between two homozygous parents with different dominant alleles, but that would require more loci.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross is between two homozygous parents, each with a different spheroid allele, leading to an F1 that is heterozygous for two loci. For example, parents could be AABB and aabb. Then F1 would be AaBb. Selfing F1 would produce F2 with a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but if there's an interaction, perhaps some phenotypes merge.

Wait, but the observed data is two phenotypes. Let's say that when at least one dominant allele is present in either locus, the fruit is spheroid, and only when both are recessive, it's elongated. That would give a 15:1 ratio because 15 (all except aa bb) would be spheroid and 1 (aa bb) would be elongated. But the observed data is 89:62, which is approximately 1.43:1, not 15:1 (which would be about 15/16=0.9375).

Hmm, that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the pattern is that spheroid requires at least one dominant allele at each of two loci. So only when both are dominant would it be spheroid, and any other combination would be elongated. That would give a 9:7 ratio, as I considered earlier. But the options don't include that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D: 9:6:1 ratio. Let me think again. 9:6:1 adds up to 16, so 9+6+1=16. If the data had three phenotypes in this ratio, but the question mentions only two, so perhaps the observed data is a subset or some phenotypes are combined.

Alternatively, perhaps the two spheroid parents are not the same genotype. For example, one is SS and the other is Ss (but no, Ss isn't homozygous). So that can't be.

Wait, another angle: the F1 is probably heterozygous, and the F2 shows a 89:62 ratio. Let's compute the chi-square to see which ratio fits best.

The observed counts are 89 spheroid and 62 elongated. Let's test against the expected ratios.

First, let's consider if it's a 9:7 ratio. The expected counts would be (9/16)*151 ≈88.1 and (7/16)*151≈62.1. That's very close to the observed 89 and 62. So the chi-square would be very low, indicating a good fit.

But none of the options mention 9:7. The closest option is D, which talks about 9:6:1, but that's three phenotypes.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but the data collapses into two phenotypes. For example, maybe two of the three phenotypes in 9:6:1 are merging into one category, making it appear as a 15:1 ratio. But 9+6=15 and 1 is separate. So if the data is 89 (9+6) and 62 (1), but that doesn't fit because 9+6=15 parts and 1 part. So 15:1 would be 15/16 spheroid and 1/16 elongated. But 89 is 15 parts and 62 is 1 part, but 15+1=16 parts. 15 parts would be (15/16)*151≈144, which doesn't match 89. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the data fits a 15:1 ratio. Let's compute expected counts: 15 parts spheroid and 1 part elongated. 15+1=16. So 15/16 of 151 is ≈144, and 1/16≈9.5. Observed is 89 and 62, which doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a 3:1 ratio. 3 parts spheroid, 1 part elongated. 3+1=4. 3/4 of 151≈113, and 1/4≈38. Observed is 89 and 62, which doesn't match.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think about the options again.

Option E: 12:3:1 ratio, which is three phenotypes. But our data has two.

Option D: 9:6:1, which is three phenotypes, but perhaps in the data, two of them are considered the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E: 12:3:1, which is a case of dominant epistasis. Let's see what that would look like. 12 parts show one phenotype, 3 parts another, and 1 part another. But again, our data has two phenotypes.

Wait, perhaps the observed data is a case where two of the three phenotypes in 12:3:1 have merged. For example, if two phenotypes are similar and grouped together, the ratio would appear as (12+3):1 =15:1, but that's not matching the observed data.

Alternatively, maybe the data fits a 9:7 ratio, which isn't listed as an option. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but I have to choose from the given options.

Wait, the options don't include 9:7, so perhaps I'm missing something in the setup. Let me re-read the question.

The cross is between two different homozygous spheroid varieties. So perhaps each parent is homozygous for different alleles at two loci. For example, one parent is AABB and the other is aabb. Then F1 would be AaBb. Selfing F1 would produce F2 with a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But if there's an interaction, perhaps some of these phenotypes are grouped.

Wait, but the observed data is 89 spheroid and 62 elongated. Let's see what 9:3:3:1 would predict. 9 parts spheroid (A_B_), 3 parts (A_bb and aaB_), and 1 part (aabb). If the question groups A_B_ as spheroid and all others as elongated, then the ratio would be (9+3+3) :1 =15:1, but that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the spheroid phenotype is only when both loci are dominant, making the ratio 9:7. So 9 spheroid and 7 elongated. That's close to the observed data.

But since the options don't have 9:7, perhaps the correct answer is option E: 12:3:1, but that's three phenotypes.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross is between two parents that are homozygous for different alleles at a single locus. For example, one is AA and the other is aa. Their F1 is Aa, which is spheroid (since A is dominant). F2 would be AA (25%), Aa (50%), aa (25%). The phenotypes would be spheroid (75%) and elongated (25%), giving a 3:1 ratio. But the observed data is 89:62, which is about 1.43:1, not 3:1.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option E: 12:3:1 indicates dominant epistasis. That ratio comes from a situation where one gene is epistatic and dominant. For example, when gene A is dominant, the phenotype is determined by gene B. Let's say AA or Aa gives spheroid if B is present, and aa gives elongated regardless of B. Wait, no, that would give a 12:3:1 ratio if gene B has two phenotypes when gene A is present.

Wait, 12:3:1 comes from (9 +3) : (3 +1), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps gene A is epistatic and dominant. So when A is present, the phenotype depends on gene B. If A is present, and B is dominant, it's one phenotype; if B is recessive, another. If A is recessive, it's a third phenotype.

But in our case, we only have two phenotypes, so perhaps two of the three categories are merging.

Another approach: let's compute the chi-square for each possible ratio.

First, let's test the 9:7 ratio. Expected counts: spheroid = (9/16)*151≈88.1, elongated=(7/16)*151≈62.9. Observed are 89 and 62. The chi-square would be very low, as the observed closely matches the expected.

Now, let's test 15:1. Expected spheroid=15/16*151≈144, elongated≈9.5. Observed are 89 and 62. Chi-square would be high, so not a good fit.

Option E: 12:3:1. Let's compute the expected counts. 12+3+1=16. So spheroid (12 parts) = (12/16)*151≈113.25, another phenotype (3 parts)=3/16*151≈28.28, and the third (1 part)=9.44. But our observed data has only two phenotypes, so this doesn't fit.

Option D: 9:6:1. So spheroid=9/16*151≈88.1, another phenotype=6/16*151≈56.6, elongated=1/16*151≈9.44. But observed has only two phenotypes, so perhaps 88.1 +56.6=144.7 spheroid, and 9.44 elongated. But observed is 89 and 62, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E: 12:3:1, but the data is such that two phenotypes are being considered as one. For example, if the 3 and 1 parts are being grouped into elongated, making the ratio 12: (3+1)=12:4. But that's a 3:1 ratio, which doesn't fit the observed data.

Alternatively, perhaps the data fits a 9:7 ratio, which isn't listed, but the closest option might be D, which mentions 9:6:1, but that's three phenotypes.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option E: 12:3:1, but the data is such that the two phenotypes are spheroid and another, with the third phenotype being spheroid as well. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D: 9:6:1 ratio, but the data is actually two phenotypes, so perhaps the third phenotype is not present, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option E: 12:3:1, but I'm not seeing how that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option F: 9:3:3:1, which is the typical dihybrid cross ratio. But the observed data is two phenotypes, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in thinking that the cross is between two homozygous spheroid plants. Maybe one is homozygous dominant and the other is homozygous recessive? No, because if both are spheroid, then they can't be recessive.

Wait, perhaps the cross is between two different homozygous spheroid varieties, each homozygous for different alleles at two loci. For example, one parent is AABB and the other is aabb. Then F1 would be AaBb. Selfing F1 would produce F2 with a 9:3:3:1 ratio. If the phenotype is spheroid only when both loci are dominant, then the 9:3:3:1 becomes 9 spheroid and 7 elongated (3+3+1), giving a 9:7 ratio. That fits the observed data closely.

But the options don't have 9:7, so perhaps the correct answer is option D: 9:6:1 ratio. Wait, but that's a three-phenotype ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but I have to choose from the options.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the cross is between two parents that are homozygous for different traits, but the F2 is showing a 9:7 ratio due to epistasis. So the answer would involve two loci and epistasis, but the options don't have that.

Looking back at the options, option E is 12:3:1, which is a dominant epistatic ratio. Let me think about what that would look like.

In dominant epistasis, the presence of at least one dominant allele at one locus (say, gene A) is required for the expression of gene B. So, if A is present, the phenotype depends on B: B_ gives spheroid, bb gives elongated. If A is recessive (aa), then regardless of B, the phenotype is elongated.

So the phenotypic ratio would be:

- A_ B_: spheroid
- A_ bb: elongated
- aa __: elongated

So the ratio would be (prob of A_ B_) : (prob of A_ bb + aa __).

Calculating probabilities:

Prob A_ is 3/4, prob B_ is 1/4 → 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16 spheroid.

Prob A_ bb is 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16 elongated.

Prob aa is 1/4, and regardless of B, it's elongated → 1/4 *1 = 1/4 elongated.

Total spheroid: 3/16.

Total elongated: 3/16 +4/16=7/16.

So the ratio is 3:7, which is not matching the observed 89:62 (≈1.43:1). So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps it's recessive epistasis. Let me think: if gene A is epistatic and recessive, then only when aa does the phenotype depend on gene B. Otherwise, the phenotype is spheroid.

So:

- A_ __: spheroid
- aa B_: elongated
- aa bb: another phenotype (say, elongated more)

Wait, but that would give a ratio of (A_ __) : (aa B_ + aa bb) = 12:3:1? No, let me compute:

In a dihybrid cross, the genotypes would be:

A_B_: spheroid

A_Bb: spheroid

A_ bb: spheroid

AaB_: spheroid

Aabb: spheroid

AaBb: spheroid

Aabb: spheroid

Aabb: spheroid

aaB_: elongated (if B_ gives another phenotype)

aabb: elongated (or another phenotype)

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try again.

If gene A is recessive epistatic, meaning that only when aa does gene B affect the phenotype.

So:

- If genotype is A_ __: phenotype is spheroid.

- If genotype is aa __:

   - B_ : phenotype is elongated.

   - bb : phenotype is elongated (same as B_).

Wait, that would make all aa __ as elongated, and A_ __ as spheroid. So the ratio would be 12 (A_ __) :4 (aa __) → 3:1. But observed is 89:62, which is about 1.43:1, not 3:1.

Hmm. I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think differently.

The observed data is 89 spheroid and 62 elongated. Let's compute the ratio as 89:62 ≈1.43:1.

The expected ratios in the options are:

- B:15:1 →≈0.94:1

- E:12:3:1 →≈4:1 (but three phenotypes)

- D:9:6:1 →≈1.5:1 (three phenotypes)

- F:9:3:3:1 → four phenotypes.

Wait, 9:6:1 is approximately 1.5:1 when considering spheroid as 9+6=15 and elongated as 1, but that's 15:1, which is higher than observed.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, and the data is grouped into two phenotypes, making it 15:1, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option E: 12:3:1, but with two phenotypes, making it (12+3):1=15:1, but that doesn't fit the observed data.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D:9:6:1, which is 9:6:1, but in the data, the third phenotype is not observed, making it appear as 15:1. But that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option E: 12:3:1, which would involve three phenotypes, but the data only shows two, so maybe the third phenotype is not present or is grouped.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D:9:6:1, but the data is being considered as two phenotypes, so 9+6=15 and 1, making it 15:1, but again, that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option E: 12:3:1, but I'm not seeing how that applies.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the option that mentions two loci with complete dominance and interaction leading to a 9:7 ratio, but since that's not an option, perhaps the closest is option D:9:6:1, but with two phenotypes.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E:12:3:1, which is a three-phenotype ratio, but the data has two, so that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option E:12:3:1, but the data is such that two phenotypes are combined, making it 15:1, but that's not matching.

I'm stuck. Let me try to think about the F1 genotype and phenotype.

The parents are two different homozygous spheroid varieties. Let's say each is homozygous for different alleles at two loci. For example, parent 1 is AABB, parent 2 is aabb. Then F1 is AaBb. F1's phenotype would be spheroid (assuming both loci contribute to spheroid). Then F2 would be a dihybrid cross.

If the phenotype is determined by both loci being dominant, then F2 would have 9 spheroid (A_B_), 3 (A_bb), 3 (aaB_), and 1 (aabb). If spheroid requires both loci to be dominant, then only 9 would be spheroid, and the rest (3+3+1=7) would be elongated. So the ratio would be 9:7. That's close to the observed data.

But the options don't have 9:7. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but among the options, option D mentions 9:6:1, which is three phenotypes, but the data has two.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E:12:3:1, but that's three phenotypes.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option E:12:3:1, but I'm not seeing how it applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D:9:6:1, which would involve three phenotypes, but the data has two, so perhaps the third phenotype is not present.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E:12:3:1, but the data is such that two phenotypes are being considered as one.

I'm not making progress here. Let me try to think about the correct answer based on the options.

The observed data is approximately 9:7, which suggests a dihybrid cross with no epistasis, but the chi-square fits 9:7. But since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option D:9:6:1, but that's three phenotypes.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option E:12:3:1, which is a dominant epistatic ratio. Let me think again.

In dominant epistasis, the presence of a dominant allele at one locus (A) allows the other locus (B) to be expressed. So:

- A_ B_: phenotype 1 (spheroid)

- A_ bb: phenotype 2 (elongated)

- aa __: phenotype 3 (elongated)

So the ratio is 12:3:1 if the phenotypes are arranged that way. But our data has two phenotypes, so perhaps the third phenotype is grouped with one of the others.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option E:12:3:1, but the data is grouped into two, making it 15:1, but that doesn't fit.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the data fitting a 9:7 ratio, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option E:12:3:1, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: the observed data is 89 spheroid and 62 elongated. Let's compute the expected for 12:3:1.

Total parts=16. 12 parts spheroid, 3 parts elongated, 1 part another. So expected spheroid=12/16*151=113.25, which is higher than observed 89. So not a fit.

Option D:9:6:1. So spheroid=9/16*151≈88.1, another phenotype=6/16*151≈56.6, elongated=1/16*151≈9.44. Observed spheroid is 89, which is close to 88.1, but elongated is 62, which is much higher than 9.44. So that's not matching.

Option E:12:3:1. Again, not matching.

Option F:9:3:3:1. So spheroid=9/16*151≈88.1, another=3/16*151≈28.3, another=3/16*151≈28.3, elongated=1/16*151≈9.44. Observed is 89 and 62, so the other two phenotypes are missing, which doesn't fit.

Option B:15:1. spheroid=15/16*151≈144, elongated≈9.5. Observed is 89 and 62, which doesn't fit.

Option C:3:1. spheroid=3/4*151≈113, elongated≈38. Doesn't fit.

Option I:1:2:1. Three phenotypes, doesn't fit.

Option J: multiple alleles at one locus, which would change the ratio, but I'm not sure.

Option A: codominance at one locus and complete dominance at another. That would lead to more than two phenotypes, so doesn't fit.

Option G: incomplete dominance at both loci. That would lead to more than two phenotypes, so no.

Option H: interaction between two recessive genes produces a new phenotype. So perhaps when both are recessive, a new phenotype appears. But in our data, it's two phenotypes, so perhaps when both are recessive, it's one phenotype, and others are another. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option E:12:3:1, but I'm not seeing it.

After all this, I think the correct answer is option E:12:3:1, but I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D:9:6:1, but that's three phenotypes.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option E:12:3:1, which involves dominant epistasis, leading to a 12:3:1 ratio. But the data has two phenotypes, so maybe two of the three are grouped.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D:9:6:1, but the data doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option E:12:3:1, but I'm not seeing it clearly.

I think I've spent enough time, and the best fit is that the data fits a 9:7 ratio, which isn't listed, but among the options, option D is 9:6:1, which is close but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E:12:3:1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the chi-square test.

Compute the expected counts for each option and the observed.

For 9:7 ratio:

Expected spheroid=88.1, elongated=62.9.

Observed=89,62.

Chi-square= ((89-88.1)^2)/88.1 + ((62-62.9)^2)/62.9 ≈ (0.81/88.1) + (0.81/62.9) ≈0.0092 +0.0129≈0.0221.

For 15:1 ratio:

Expected spheroid=144, elongated=9.5.

Observed=89,62.

Chi-square= ((89-144)^2)/144 + ((62-9.5)^2)/9.5 ≈ (35^2)/144 + (52.5^2)/9.5 ≈1225/144≈8.5 + 2756/9.5≈290.1 → total≈298.6, which is very high, so not a fit.

For 12:3:1 ratio:

Assuming two phenotypes, but this is three, so not applicable.

For 9:6:1 ratio:

Expected spheroid=88.1, another=56.6, elongated=9.44.

Observed spheroid=89, but no data for the other two. So can't compute chi-square.

Thus, the best fit is the 9:7 ratio, which isn't listed, but the chi-square is very low, indicating a good fit.

But since the options don't have 9:7, perhaps the intended answer is option E:12:3:1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the cross is between two different homozygous spheroid parents, each homozygous for different alleles at the same locus. For example, one is AABB and the other is AAbb. Wait, no, that wouldn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross is between SS and Ss, but that's not homozygous.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the data fitting a 9:7 ratio, which isn't listed, but the closest option is not present, perhaps the correct answer is option E:12:3:1, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option E:12:3:1, which involves dominant epistasis, leading to a 12:3:1 ratio, but the data is grouped into two phenotypes, making it appear as 15:1, but that's not matching.

I think I have to make a choice. The observed data closely fits a 9:7 ratio, which is a dihybrid cross with two genes both needed for spheroid. Since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is option E:12:3:1, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D:9:6:1, but that's three phenotypes.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option E:12:3:1, which involves dominant epistasis, leading to a 12:3:1 ratio. But the data has two phenotypes, so perhaps the third phenotype is grouped.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option E:12:3:1, but I'm not seeing it clearly.

After all this, I think the correct answer is option E:12:3:1, indicating dominant epistasis.

The question involves analyzing the inheritance pattern of fruit shape in summer squash, where spheroid is dominant over elongated. A cross between two homozygous spheroid varieties results in an F₂ generation with 89 spheroid and 62 elongated fruits, yielding a ratio of approximately 1.43:1. The goal is to determine which inheritance pattern fits this data using chi-square analysis.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Observed Data**:  
   - Spheroid: 89  
   - Elongated: 62  
   - Total: 151  
   - Ratio: ~1.43:1  

2. **Expected Ratios**:  
   - **9:7 Ratio**: This ratio arises in a dihybrid cross when two dominant alleles are required for the spheroid phenotype. The expected counts are:  
     - Spheroid: \( \frac{9}{16} \times 151 \approx 88.1 \)  
     - Elongated: \( \frac{7}{16} \times 151 \approx 62.9 \)  
     - The observed data closely matches this ratio, suggesting a 9:7 inheritance pattern.  

   - **15:1 Ratio**: This ratio occurs when one gene is epistatic, and the presence of at least one dominant allele at that locus masks the expression of another locus. The expected counts are:  
     - Spheroid: \( \frac{15}{16} \times 151 \approx 144 \)  
     - Elongated: \( \frac{1}{16} \times 151 \approx 9.5 \)  
     - This does not fit the observed data.  

   - **12:3:1 Ratio**: This ratio involves dominant epistasis, where one gene is epistatic, and the presence of a dominant allele at that locus determines the phenotype. The expected counts are:  
     - Spheroid: \( \frac{12}{16} \times 151 \approx 113.25 \)  
     - Phenotype 2: \( \frac{3}{16} \times 151 \approx 28.28 \)  
     - Elongated: \( \frac{1}{16} \times 151 \approx 9.44 \)  
     - This does not fit the observed data, as it involves three phenotypes, while the data shows only two.  

   - **9:6:1 Ratio**: This ratio involves two loci with incomplete dominance. The expected counts are:  
     - Spheroid: \( \frac{9}{16} \times 151 \approx 88.1 \)  
     - Phenotype 2: \( \frac{6}{16} \times 151 \approx 56.6 \)  
     - Elongated: \( \frac{1}{16} \times 151 \approx 9.44 \)  
     - This does not fit the observed data, as it involves three phenotypes.  

3. **Conclusion**:  
   The observed data fits a **9:7 ratio**, which suggests that two loci are involved, and both dominant alleles are required for the spheroid phenotype. However, this ratio is not explicitly listed in the options. Among the given choices, **Option E (12:3:1)** is the closest, as it involves dominant epistasis, even though it predicts three phenotypes instead of two.
