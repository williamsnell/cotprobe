Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about an ideal gas undergoing an isothermal reversible expansion. Hmm, I remember that in isothermal processes, the temperature remains constant, so for ideal gases, the internal energy doesn't change because internal energy depends only on temperature. That makes sense.

The problem states that 2 moles of an ideal gas are expanded reversibly and isothermally at 0°C from 1 atm. The heat absorbed during the process is 1 = 750 cal. Wait, wait, I think there might be a typo there. It says 1 = 750 cal. Maybe that's just the heat Q, like Q equals 750 calories. Yeah, that makes more sense. So the heat absorbed is 750 calories.

I need to find the final volume occupied by the gas. The options are given from A to J, with various liters. So I need to calculate the final volume.

Alright, let me recall the formula for heat in an isothermal process. For an ideal gas undergoing a reversible isothermal expansion, the heat absorbed Q is equal to nRT ln(V2/V1), I think. Or wait, is it Q = nRT ln(V2/V1)? Or maybe it's Q = nRT ln(P1/P2) because pressure is inversely related to volume. Let me make sure.

Wait, the formula for isothermal processes: when the process is reversible and isothermal, the work done is W = nRT ln(V2/V1). And since for isothermal processes, the heat absorbed Q equals the work done, because ΔU is zero. So Q = W. So yes, Q = nRT ln(V2/V1).

But wait, in this case, the process is expansion, so V2 is larger than V1. So ln(V2/V1) will be positive, and heat is absorbed, which matches the question. So the formula should be correct.

Given that, let's note the variables:

n = 2 moles
T = 0°C, which is 273.15 K (since 0°C is 273.15 K)
Q = 750 cal

Wait, but in the formula, the units for R matter. R is usually 8.314 J/(mol·K), but since Q is given in calories, I might need to convert units or use R in cal/(mol·K). Let me check: R is 8.314 J/(mol·K) = 1.987 cal/(mol·K) approximately, because 1 calorie is about 4.184 joules. Wait, actually, 1 cal = 4.184 J, so R in cal/(mol·K) is 8.314 / 4.184 ≈ 1.987 cal/(mol·K).

Alternatively, I can convert Q from cal to J. Let me think about that. Maybe it's easier to convert everything into SI units, so let's try that.

So Q is 750 cal. Since 1 cal = 4.184 J, so Q = 750 * 4.184 J. Let me calculate that: 750 * 4 = 3000, 750 * 0.184 = 138, so total is 3138 J. So Q = 3138 J.

Now, the formula is Q = nRT ln(V2/V1). I have Q, n, R, T, and I need to find V2. But wait, I also know the initial pressure P1 is 1 atm. So maybe I can relate V1 and P1 using the ideal gas law.

The ideal gas law is PV = nRT. So at initial state, P1 V1 = n R T. So V1 = (n R T) / P1.

I can calculate V1 using P1 = 1 atm. But I need to make sure the units are consistent. Since R is in J/(mol·K), and pressure is in atm, I might need to convert atm to Pascals.

1 atm = 101325 Pascals. So P1 = 101325 Pa.

So let's compute V1:

V1 = (n R T) / P1
n = 2 mol
R = 8.314 J/(mol·K)
T = 273.15 K
P1 = 101325 Pa

So V1 = (2 * 8.314 * 273.15) / 101325

Let me calculate the numerator: 2 * 8.314 ≈ 16.628. Multiply by 273.15:

16.628 * 273 ≈ Let's approximate 16.628 * 270 = 4490. Then 16.628 *3.15 ≈ 52.3. So total around 4542.3 J.

So numerator is approximately 4542.3 J.

Denominator is 101325 Pa. So V1 = 4542.3 / 101325 ≈ 0.04485 m³. Since 1 m³ = 1000 liters, 0.04485 m³ = 44.85 liters. So V1 is approximately 44.85 liters.

Wait, that's interesting because one of the options is 44.8 liters, option B. But that's the initial volume. The final volume is larger, so the answer must be higher than that.

Now, going back to the formula Q = nRT ln(V2/V1). We have Q = 3138 J, n=2, R=8.314, T=273.15.

So plug in the numbers:

3138 = 2 * 8.314 * 273.15 * ln(V2 / 44.85)

Let me compute 2 * 8.314 = 16.628

16.628 * 273.15 ≈ Let's compute 16 * 273 = 4368, 0.628 * 273 ≈ 171. So total approximately 4539.

So 3138 = 4539 * ln(V2 / 44.85)

Divide both sides by 4539:

3138 / 4539 ≈ 0.6915 = ln(V2 /44.85)

Now, to solve for V2/V1:

V2 / 44.85 = e^(0.6915)

What's e^0.6915? Since ln(2)=0.6931, which is approximately 0.69, so e^0.69 is about 2. So e^0.6915 ≈ 2.

Therefore, V2 ≈ 44.85 * 2 = 89.7 liters.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 89.7 exactly. The closest is option I: 92.1 liters and option E: 110 liters. Hmm, perhaps my approximation was too rough. Let me be more precise.

Wait, 0.6915 is very close to ln(2), which is approximately 0.6931. So ln(2) is about 0.6931, so 0.6915 is just slightly less than ln(2), so e^0.6915 is just a bit less than 2.

Let me calculate it more accurately. Let me compute 0.6915.

We can use the Taylor series expansion for e^x around x=0.69:

e^x ≈ e^0.69 * (1 + (x-0.69) * e^0.69 )

Wait, perhaps a better way is to use a calculator-like approach.

Alternatively, since 0.6915 is 0.6931 - 0.0016. So e^0.6915 = e^(0.6931 - 0.0016) = e^0.6931 * e^(-0.0016) = 2 * (1 - 0.0016 + ...) ≈ 2 * 0.9984 = 1.9968.

So approximately 1.9968, which is almost 2, but slightly less.

So V2 ≈ 44.85 * 1.9968 ≈ 44.85 * 2 = 89.7, but slightly less, like 89.6 liters.

Looking at the options, the closest is option I: 92.1 liters, but that's a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, maybe I should re-calculate the exact value without approximations.

Let me recompute step by step.

First, compute 2 * 8.314 * 273.15:

2 *8.314 = 16.628

16.628 * 273.15:

Let me compute this accurately.

Compute 16 * 273.15 = 4369.2 (since 16*273=4368, 16*0.15=2.4, total 4370.4)

Wait, 16 * 273.15 = 16*(273 + 0.15) = 16*273=4368, 16*0.15=2.4 → total 4370.4

Now, 0.628 * 273.15. Let's compute 0.6 * 273.15 = 163.89, 0.028 * 273.15 ≈7.6482. So total is 163.89 +7.6482=171.5382

So total 16.628 * 273.15 = 4370.4 + 171.5382 ≈ 4541.9382 J.

So 4541.9382 J.

Now, Q is 3138 J.

So ln(V2/V1) = Q/(nRT) = 3138 / 4541.9382 ≈ 0.6915.

So V2/V1 = e^0.6915 ≈ 2. So V2 is approximately 2 * V1.

As V1 is about 44.85 liters, V2 is about 89.7 liters.

Looking at the options, the closest is I: 92.1 liters, but that's a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial volume.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of V1. Maybe I approximated too much.

V1 = (n R T) / P1 = (2 *8.314 * 273.15) / 101325

Compute numerator exactly:

2 *8.314 =16.628

16.628 *273.15:

Compute 16 *273.15=4370.4

0.628 *273.15= let's compute 0.6 *273.15=163.89, 0.028 *273.15=7.6482 → total 171.5382.

So total numerator: 4370.4 +171.5382=4541.9382 J.

Divide by P1=101325 Pa.

V1=4541.9382 /101325 ≈0.04485 m³, which is 44.85 liters. Correct.

So V2≈89.7 liters. The options don't have this number. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 84.4

B:44.8

C:60

D:50

E:110

F:100

G:75

H:120

I:92.1

J:70

So 89.7 isn't there, but the closest is option I:92.1.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that Q = nRT ln(V2/V1) is correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the process is at 0°C, which is 273 K, but perhaps in the formula, R is in different units.

Wait, another approach: let's use R in cal/(mol·K). Since 1 cal =4.184 J, R=8.314 J/(mol·K) =8.314 /4.184 ≈1.987 cal/(mol·K).

So let me try this approach again, using Q in cal.

Q = 750 cal.

So Q = nRT ln(V2/V1)

n=2, R=1.987 cal/(mol·K), T=273.15 K.

So 750 = 2 *1.987 *273.15 * ln(V2/V1)

Compute 2 *1.987 =3.974

3.974 *273.15 ≈ Let me compute 3 *273=819, 0.974 *273≈266. So total around 1085.

Wait, more accurately:

3.974 *273.15 = ?

Well, 3.974 *273 = let's compute 3 *273=819, 0.974 *273.

0.974 *273 = (1-0.026)*273=273 -0.026*273=273-7.098=265.902.

So total 819 +265.902=1084.902.

Now, 3.974 *0.15 =0.5961.

So total is 1084.902 +0.5961=1085.498 ≈1085.5.

So 750 =1085.5 * ln(V2/V1)

Thus, ln(V2/V1)=750/1085.5≈0.6907

Which is about the same as before, 0.6907. So e^0.6907≈1.996, so V2/V1≈2, so V2≈89.7 liters.

Again, same result. So perhaps the options have a typo, or maybe I made a mistake in assuming the formula.

Wait another thought: in some cases, the formula is written as Q = nRT ln(P1/P2), because pressure is inversely related to volume. Let me check that.

Since for isothermal processes, PV = constant, so P1 V1 = P2 V2.

So ln(P1/P2) = ln(V2/V1).

Because P1 V1 = P2 V2 → P1/P2 = V2/V1 → ln(P1/P2) = ln(V2/V1).

So Q = nRT ln(V2/V1) = nRT ln(P1/P2).

So either way, same result. So no problem there.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the initial approach. Because in the problem statement, it says the heat absorbed is 750 cal. But in an expansion, the system does work, so the heat is absorbed, which matches. So the formula is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should use the van 't Hoff equation approach? Or maybe think about the work done.

Wait, another approach: the work done in reversible isothermal expansion is W = nRT ln(V2/V1). And since Q=W for isothermal processes (because ΔU=0), so Q = nRT ln(V2/V1). So same formula.

So perhaps the answer isn't exactly matching the options, but maybe I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, let me compute ln(V2/V1) = Q/(nRT) =750 cal / (2 *1.987 cal/(mol·K) *273.15 K)

Compute denominator: 2 *1.987 =3.974; 3.974 *273.15≈1085.5.

So ln(V2/V1)=750/1085.5≈0.6907.

So V2/V1 = e^0.6907≈1.996≈2. So V2≈2 *V1=89.7 liters.

But the options don't have 89.7. The closest is I:92.1.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute e^0.6907.

Using a calculator, e^0.6907 is approximately e^0.6931 is 2. So 0.6907 is slightly less, so e^0.6907≈1.995.

But perhaps using a more precise method:

We can use the Taylor series expansion around x=0.69:

Let me set x=0.6907.

We know that ln(2)=0.6931, so x=0.6907 is 0.0024 less than ln(2). So e^x = e^(ln(2) -0.0024) =2 * e^(-0.0024).

e^(-0.0024) ≈1 -0.0024 + (0.0024)^2/2 - ... ≈0.9976.

So e^0.6907≈2 *0.9976≈1.9952.

So V2=44.85 *1.9952≈44.85 *2=89.7, but slightly less: 44.85 *1.9952.

Compute 44.85 *1.9952:

=44.85*(2 -0.0048)=44.85*2 -44.85*0.0048

=89.7 -0.21528≈89.485 liters.

So approximately 89.5 liters. Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the initial pressure is in atm, and when I calculated V1, I used P1=101325 Pa, which is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should use V1 in liters and use R in terms of L·atm/(mol·K). Let me try that approach.

Because sometimes, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). Let me try that.

So R =0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

Then, using the ideal gas law: P1 V1 = n R T.

So V1 = (n R T)/P1.

n=2, R=0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), T=273.15 K, P1=1 atm.

So V1 = (2 *0.0821 *273.15)/1 atm.

Compute this:

2 *0.0821 =0.1642

0.1642 *273.15 ≈ Let's compute 0.1642 *273 =44.85 liters. 0.1642 *0.15=0.02463 → total 44.8746 liters.

Which matches our earlier result of 44.85 liters.

Now, using the formula Q = nRT ln(V2/V1), but now using R in L·atm/(mol·K) and Q in calories.

Wait, but Q is in calories. So perhaps I need to convert Q into L·atm units.

Because 1 L·atm ≈ 101.325 J, and 1 cal =4.184 J.

So 1 L·atm = 101.325 /4.184 ≈24.21 cal.

So to convert Q from cal to L·atm:

Q =750 cal * (1 L·atm /24.21 cal) ≈750 /24.21 ≈31.0 L·atm.

So now, Q = nRT ln(V2/V1)

n=2, R=0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), T=273.15 K.

So 31.0 = 2 *0.0821 *273.15 * ln(V2/44.8746)

Compute denominator:

2 *0.0821 =0.1642

0.1642 *273.15 ≈44.85.

So 31.0 =44.85 * ln(V2/44.8746)

Thus, ln(V2/44.8746)=31.0/44.85≈0.6915.

So again, same as before, V2/44.8746≈e^0.6915≈1.996.

So V2≈44.8746 *1.996≈89.6 liters.

Same result. So perhaps the correct answer is approximately 89.6 liters, but the options don't have that.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Q in L·atm. Let me double-check:

Q=750 cal.

1 cal =4.184 J.

So 750 cal =750*4.184=3138 J.

Now, 1 L·atm =101.325 J.

So Q in L·atm is 3138 /101.325 ≈31.0 L·atm.

Yes, that's correct.

So the calculation is correct. The only thing I can think of is that perhaps the initial volume is not exactly 44.85 liters, but perhaps a slight approximation is made.

Wait, perhaps the initial volume is taken as exactly 44.8 liters (option B), which is close to our calculated 44.85. So maybe the exact calculation would give V2=89.6 liters, but the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the heat Q is 750 cal, which is 750 calories, but perhaps the formula uses R in a different unit.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is written as Q = nRT ln(V2/V1), but sometimes it's written as Q = nRT ln(P1/P2), but since P1 V1 = P2 V2, it's the same as ln(V2/V1).

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the process is expansion, so V2 > V1, so the ratio is greater than 1, so the ln is positive, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that in the problem statement, it says the heat absorbed is 1 =750 cal. That seems odd. Maybe that's a typo, and it's supposed to be Q=750 cal.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to say that the heat absorbed is 750 J, not calories. Let me check what happens if I take Q=750 J.

If Q=750 J, then in the formula Q =nRT ln(V2/V1).

Using R=8.314 J/(mol·K):

750 =2 *8.314 *273.15 * ln(V2/44.85)

Compute denominator: 2*8.314=16.628; 16.628*273.15≈4542 J.

So ln(V2/44.85)=750/4542≈0.165.

So V2/44.85= e^0.165≈1.179.

So V2≈44.85 *1.179≈52.8 liters. But that's not matching any option either. The closest is option D:50 liters. But that doesn't make sense because 52.8 is closer to 50 than to 60, but the options don't have 52.8.

Wait, but the problem states that the heat absorbed is 750 cal, not 750 J. So perhaps the initial approach was correct, and the answer should be around 89.5 liters, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I used R=8.314 J/(mol·K) when I should have used R=0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). Let me try that again.

So using R=0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), and Q in L·atm.

As before, Q=31.0 L·atm.

So 31.0 =2 *0.0821 *273.15 * ln(V2/44.85)

Compute denominator:2*0.0821=0.1642; 0.1642*273.15≈44.85.

So ln(V2/44.85)=31.0/44.85≈0.6915.

Same as before, so V2≈89.6 liters.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses R=0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) but without converting Q properly.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial volume is taken as 22.4 liters per mole at STP, but 0°C is 273 K, and STP is 273 K and 1 atm, so for 2 moles, V1=44.8 liters, which matches our calculation.

So, perhaps the answer is approximately 89.6 liters, but since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is option I:92.1 liters. But how?

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation of e^0.6907 more accurately.

Using a calculator, e^0.6907 is approximately 1.995, but perhaps more accurately:

We can compute e^0.6907:

We know that ln(2)=0.69314718056.

So 0.6907 is 0.69314718056 -0.00244718 approximately.

So e^0.6907 = e^(ln(2) -0.00244718) =2 * e^(-0.00244718).

Now, e^(-0.00244718) ≈1 -0.00244718 + (0.00244718)^2/2.

Compute:

0.00244718 ≈0.002447

So e^(-0.002447) ≈1 -0.002447 + (0.002447)^2/2.

Compute (0.002447)^2 ≈5.988e-6. Divided by 2 is 2.994e-6.

So e^(-0.002447) ≈0.997553 + 0.000002994≈0.997556.

So e^0.6907≈2 *0.997556≈1.995112.

So V2=44.85 *1.995112≈44.85 *2=89.7 - (44.85 *0.004888)=44.85 *0.004888≈0.219.

So 89.7 -0.219≈89.481 liters.

Still around 89.5 liters.

Wait, perhaps the options intended to have 89.5 as an option, but it's not there. Alternatively, perhaps the initial temperature was considered as 273 K exactly, without decimals.

Let me try using T=273 K exactly.

So V1=(2 *0.0821 *273)/1=2*0.0821=0.1642; 0.1642*273=44.8 liters (exactly).

Then, Q=750 cal=31.0 L·atm.

So ln(V2/44.8)=31/(2*0.0821*273)=31/(44.8)=0.6915.

So same as before, V2=44.8 * e^0.6915≈44.8 *2=89.6 liters.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option I:92.1 liters, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula should be Q = nRT ln(V1/V2) because expansion would mean V2 > V1, so the ratio is greater than 1, but wait, no, because in expansion, work is done by the system, so heat is absorbed, so the formula should be positive.

Wait, no, the formula Q = nRT ln(V2/V1) is correct because when V2 > V1, ln is positive, and Q is positive as heat is absorbed.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the formula is Q = nRT ln(V2/V1), but in terms of pressure, it's Q = nRT ln(P1/P2). Since P1 is 1 atm and P2 is lower, ln(P1/P2) is positive.

But that doesn't change the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula Q = nRT ln(V2/V1), but with V in m³, but I don't think that affects the ratio.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the gas expands from 1 atm to another pressure, but without knowing P2, we can't proceed. Wait, no, because we have V1 and can find V2 via the ratio.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the ideal gas law for the final state to find V2.

Wait, but since the process is isothermal, P1 V1 = P2 V2.

But without knowing P2, we can't find V2 directly. So we have to rely on the heat equation.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I'm using Q = nRT ln(V2/V1), but maybe the formula is Q = nRT ln(P2/P1), which would give a negative value, but that can't be because Q is positive.

No, that can't be right because P2 < P1, so ln(P2/P1) is negative, which would make Q negative, but in reality, Q is positive as heat is absorbed.

So the correct formula must be Q =nRT ln(V2/V1).

I think I've done everything correctly, but the answer isn't matching the options. The closest option is I:92.1 liters, but that's 2.5 liters higher than my calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the initial volume was calculated as 44.8 liters, and the final volume is 89.6, which is approximately 90 liters, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the initial volume is 44.8 liters, and the final volume is 89.6 liters, which is 44.8 *2. So perhaps the answer is 89.6, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option I:92.1 liters, considering rounding differences.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of V1.

Wait, let me recompute V1 using R=0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K):

V1 = (nRT)/P1 = (2 *0.0821 *273)/1 = 44.8 liters.

Yes, correct.

So, perhaps the correct answer is 89.6 liters, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option I:92.1 liters. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the heat is 750 calories, but the formula uses R in a different way.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem uses the formula Q =nRT ln(V2/V1) with R=8.314 J/(mol·K), but without converting Q to joules.

Wait, no, that wouldn't make sense because the units wouldn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses R=2 cal/(mol·K), which is an approximation.

Wait, R is 8.314 J/(mol·K) = 1.987 cal/(mol·K). So if someone uses R=2 cal/(mol·K), then the calculation would be:

Q=750 =2 *2 *273.15 * ln(V2/44.8).

So 750=1092.6 * ln(V2/44.8).

ln(V2/44.8)=750/1092.6≈0.686.

e^0.686≈1.985.

So V2≈44.8 *1.985≈88.9 liters. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the initial volume is 22.4 liters per mole at 0°C, so 2 moles would be 44.8 liters, which is correct.

Then, using the formula Q =nRT ln(V2/V1)=750 cal.

But perhaps the problem uses R=6.0 cal/(mol·K), which is incorrect but perhaps used in some contexts.

Wait, R is approximately 6.0 cal/(mol·K) when using specific values, but that's not accurate. Let me see.

Wait, R=8.314 J/(mol·K) =1.987 cal/(mol·K). So if someone mistakenly uses R=6 cal/(mol·K), then:

Q=750=2 *6 *273.15 * ln(V2/44.8).

So 750=3277.8 * ln(V2/44.8).

ln(V2/44.8)=750/3277.8≈0.2287.

e^0.2287≈1.257.

So V2≈44.8 *1.257≈56.4 liters. Which is closer to option C:60 liters. But that's not correct because R=6 cal/(mol·K) is wrong.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to accept that the answer should be approximately 89.6 liters, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option I:92.1 liters. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem states that the heat absorbed is 750 cal, but perhaps it's actually 750 J. Let me check what happens if I take Q=750 J.

So Q=750 J.

Using R=8.314 J/(mol·K):

750 =2 *8.314 *273.15 * ln(V2/44.85).

Compute denominator:2*8.314=16.628; 16.628 *273.15≈4542 J.

So ln(V2/44.85)=750/4542≈0.165.

So V2/44.85 =e^0.165≈1.179.

So V2≈44.85 *1.179≈52.8 liters.

But that's not matching any option either.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem uses the formula Q =nRT ln(P1/P2), but since P1=1 atm and P2 is unknown, but we can relate it to V2 via PV=nRT.

Wait, but without knowing P2, it's easier to use the volume ratio.

I think I've exhausted all possible approaches. The calculation consistently gives around 89.6 liters, but the options don't have that. The closest is option I:92.1 liters. However, I'm not sure if that's the intended answer. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but among the options, option I is the closest.

To solve the problem, we analyze the isothermal reversible expansion of 2 moles of an ideal gas at 0°C (273.15 K) using the formula for heat absorption during such a process:

\[
Q = nRT \ln\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right)
\]

### Given Data:
- **Number of moles**: \( n = 2 \)
- **Temperature**: \( T = 273.15 \, \text{K} \)
- **Heat absorbed**: \( Q = 750 \, \text{cal} = 3138 \, \text{J} \) (converted using \( 1 \, \text{cal} = 4.184 \, \text{J} \))
- **Initial pressure**: \( P_1 = 1 \, \text{atm} = 101325 \, \text{Pa} \)
- **Gas constant**: \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \)

### Step 1: Calculate Initial Volume \( V_1 \)
Using the ideal gas law:
\[
P_1 V_1 = nRT \implies V_1 = \frac{nRT}{P_1}
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
V_1 = \frac{2 \cdot 8.314 \cdot 273.15}{101325} \approx 0.04485 \, \text{m}^3 = 44.85 \, \text{liters}
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \( V_2 \)
Rearrange the heat formula:
\[
\ln\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right) = \frac{Q}{nRT}
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
\ln\left(\frac{V_2}{44.85}\right) = \frac{3138}{2 \cdot 8.314 \cdot 273.15} \approx 0.6915
\]
Exponentiate both sides:
\[
\frac{V_2}{44.85} = e^{0.6915} \approx 1.996
\]
\[
V_2 \approx 44.85 \cdot 1.996 \approx 89.6 \, \text{liters}
\]

### Step 3: Compare with Options
The calculated \( V_2 \approx 89.6 \, \text{liters} \) does not match any option exactly. However, the closest option is **I: 92.1 liters**. This discrepancy may arise from rounding or approximations in the problem setup.

### Conclusion:
The most reasonable answer, based on the given options and calculations, is:

**I: 92.1 liters**
