Okay, so I need to evaluate log base 8 of 2, which is written as log₈2. Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that log_b a is the exponent you need to raise base b to get a. So in this case, I'm looking for the number x such that 8 raised to the power of x equals 2.

Let me think about the properties of exponents. I know that 8 is 2 cubed because 2 * 2 * 2 = 8. So 8 is 2³. That might be useful here. So if I rewrite 8 as 2³, the equation becomes (2³)^x = 2. 

Using the exponent rule (a^m)^n = a^(m*n), this simplifies to 2^(3x) = 2^1. Now, since the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other. So 3x = 1. Solving for x gives x = 1/3.

Wait, let me double-check that. If x is 1/3, then 8^(1/3) should equal 2. The cube root of 8 is indeed 2, so that makes sense. So log₈2 is 1/3.

Looking at the options, A is 1/3, so that should be the correct answer.

The value of log base 8 of 2 is 1/3 because 8^(1/3) equals 2.

Answer: A
