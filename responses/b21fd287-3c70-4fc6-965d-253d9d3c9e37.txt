Okay, so I've got this problem: (6^83 + 8^83) mod 49. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on modular arithmetic, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with exponents modulo a number, especially a prime or a composite, there are some theorems that might help, like Fermat's Little Theorem or Euler's theorem. But wait, 49 is 7 squared, so it's a prime power. Maybe I can use Euler's theorem here.

Euler's theorem says that if a and n are coprime, then a^φ(n) ≡ 1 mod n, where φ(n) is Euler's totient function. Let's compute φ(49). Since 49 is 7², φ(49) = 49 * (1 - 1/7) = 49 * 6/7 = 42. So φ(49) is 42. That means for any number a that's coprime with 49, a^42 ≡ 1 mod 49.

Now, I need to check if 6 and 8 are coprime with 49. 49 is 7², so any number not divisible by 7 is coprime. Both 6 and 8 are not divisible by 7, so they are coprime with 49. Great.

So, let's break down 6^83 mod 49 and 8^83 mod 49 separately.

Starting with 6^83 mod 49:
Since φ(49)=42, 6^42 ≡ 1 mod 49. So, 6^83 can be written as 6^(42*1 + 41) = (6^42)^1 * 6^41. Which simplifies to 1^1 * 6^41 mod 49. So, 6^83 ≡ 6^41 mod 49.

Similarly, for 8^83 mod 49:
8^42 ≡ 1 mod 49. So, 8^83 = 8^(42*1 + 41) = (8^42)^1 * 8^41 ≡ 1^1 * 8^41 mod 49. So, 8^83 ≡ 8^41 mod 49.

Now, I need to compute 6^41 mod 49 and 8^41 mod 49.

Wait, but 41 is one less than 42, which is φ(49). Maybe I can find a pattern or use negative exponents somehow.

I remember that a^k ≡ a^(k mod φ(n)) mod n, but that's only when a and n are coprime, which they are here. So for exponents larger than φ(n), we can reduce the exponent modulo φ(n). But in this case, 83 mod 42 is 83 - 2*42 = 83 -84= -1, so 83 ≡ -1 mod 42. So, 6^83 ≡ 6^(-1) mod 49, and similarly 8^83 ≡8^(-1) mod 49.

Wait, that's a good point. So 83 divided by 42 is 1 with a remainder of -1, because 42*2=84, which is 1 more than 83. So 83 ≡ -1 mod 42. So 6^83 ≡6^(-1) mod 49, and 8^83 ≡8^(-1) mod 49.

So now, I need to find the modular inverses of 6 and 8 modulo 49.

Let me compute 6^(-1) mod 49 first. The inverse of 6 is a number x such that 6x ≡1 mod 49.

Let's solve 6x ≡1 mod 49. Using the extended Euclidean algorithm:

We can find x such that 6x +49y =1.

Let's perform the Euclidean algorithm on 6 and 49.

49 divided by 6 is 8 with a remainder of 1, because 6*8=48, 49-48=1.

So, 49 = 6*8 +1.

Then, 1 =49 -6*8.

So, rearranged, 1 = (-8)*6 +1*49.

Thus, x is -8. But we need a positive value mod 49. -8 mod49 is 41, because 49-8=41. So 6^(-1) ≡41 mod49.

Similarly, let's find 8^(-1) mod49. We need y such that 8y ≡1 mod49.

Again, using the extended Euclidean algorithm:

49 divided by 8 is 6 with a remainder of 1, because 8*6=48, 49-48=1.

So, 49=8*6 +1.

Then, 1=49-8*6.

So, 1=(-6)*8 +1*49.

Thus, y is -6. Modulo49, that's 43, since 49-6=43. So 8^(-1) ≡43 mod49.

So now, 6^83 ≡6^(-1) ≡41 mod49, and 8^83 ≡8^(-1) ≡43 mod49.

So, adding them together: 41 +43=84.

Now, 84 mod49: 49*1=49, 84-49=35. So 84 mod49 is 35.

Therefore, (6^83 +8^83) mod49 ≡35 mod49.

Looking at the options, C is 35. So the answer should be C.

The problem requires computing \((6^{83} + 8^{83}) \mod 49\). Using Euler's theorem, since \(\phi(49) = 42\), we reduce the exponents modulo 42. Noting that \(83 \equiv -1 \mod 42\), we find \(6^{83} \equiv 6^{-1} \mod 49\) and \(8^{83} \equiv 8^{-1} \mod 49\). Finding the modular inverses, \(6^{-1} \equiv 41 \mod 49\) and \(8^{-1} \equiv 43 \mod 49\). Adding these gives \(41 + 43 = 84\), and \(84 \mod 49 = 35\).

Answer: C
