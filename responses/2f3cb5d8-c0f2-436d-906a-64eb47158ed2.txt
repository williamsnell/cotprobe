Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A researcher planning a survey of school principals in a particular state has lists of the school principals employed in each of the 125 school districts. The procedure is to obtain a random sample of principals from each of the districts rather than grouping all the lists together and obtaining a sample from the entire group. Which of the following is a correct conclusion?

Options:

A: This is a purposive sampling, where the researcher only selects individuals that meet specific characteristics.
B: This is a non-probability sampling, where the samples are gathered in a process that does not give all the individuals in the population equal chances of being selected.
C: This is a stratified sample, which may give comparative information that a simple random sample wouldn't give.
D: This is a cluster sample in which the population was divided into heterogeneous groups called clusters.
E: This is a convenience sampling, where the researcher chooses the easiest group to reach.
F: This is a snowball sampling, where existing study subjects recruit future subjects.
G: This is an example of systematic sampling, which gives a reasonable sample as long as the original order of the list is not related to the variables under consideration.
H: This is a quota sampling, where the researcher ensures equal representation of each district.
I: This is a sequential sampling, where sampling continues until a certain criteria is met.
J: This is a simple random sample obtained in an easier and less costly manner than procedures involving sampling from the entire population of principals.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about sampling methods. Let me read the question again carefully.

The researcher is planning a survey of school principals in a particular state. They have lists of principals from each of the 125 school districts. The procedure they're using is to obtain a random sample of principals from each district rather than combining all the lists and taking a sample from the entire group.

Hmm, so the key here is that they're taking a random sample from each district separately. So instead of treating all principals as one big group, they're breaking it down by districts and sampling within each.

Now, the options are A through J, each describing a different sampling method. I need to figure out which one applies here.

Let me go through each option one by one.

A: Purposive sampling. That's where you select individuals based on specific characteristics. But in this case, the researcher isn't choosing based on characteristics; they're randomly selecting from each district. So A doesn't seem right.

B: Non-probability sampling. Wait, no, because they're using a random sample from each district, which implies probability sampling. So B is incorrect.

C: Stratified sample. Stratified sampling involves dividing the population into subgroups (strata) and then randomly sampling from each. Here, each district is treated as a separate group, and they're sampling from each. So this sounds like stratified sampling. That could be the answer.

D: Cluster sampling. Cluster involves dividing the population into clusters and randomly selecting entire clusters. But here, they're sampling within each cluster (district), not selecting entire districts. So D is not correct.

E: Convenience sampling. That's when you pick the easiest groups to reach, which isn't the case here since they're randomly sampling each district. So E is out.

F: Snowball sampling. That's where existing subjects recruit others, which isn't happening here. F is incorrect.

G: Systematic sampling. This would involve selecting every nth individual, but the question doesn't mention any systematic approach like that. So G is probably not the answer.

H: Quota sampling. Quota ensures equal representation, but it's non-probability. Here, they're using random sampling within each district, so it's probability. H is not correct.

I: Sequential sampling. That's when you continue sampling until a certain condition is met. The question doesn't mention that, so I is out.

J: Simple random sample. The question says they're taking a random sample from each district, not the entire population. A simple random sample would involve selecting from the whole population, not each subgroup. So J is incorrect.

So, putting it all together, the correct method here is stratified sampling because they're dividing the population into districts (strata) and randomly sampling from each. Therefore, the answer should be C.

The researcher is using stratified sampling by randomly selecting principals from each district, ensuring representation from each subgroup.

Answer: C
