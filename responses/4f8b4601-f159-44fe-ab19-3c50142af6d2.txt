Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these situations constitutes burglary. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

First, I need to remember the definition of burglary. From what I recall, burglary typically involves unlawfully entering a building with the intent to commit a felony inside. Some places define it as entering without permission with the intent to commit a crime, not necessarily just a felony. I think it's important whether the entry was unlawful and if there was criminal intent at the time of entry.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: The defendant broke into a house to seek shelter from a snowstorm. The next morning, he took a radio. So, he entered without permission, but his initial intent was to seek shelter, not to commit a crime. However, the next morning, he took the radio. I'm not sure if the intent at the time of entry matters or if taking the radio later counts. I think for burglary, the intent must be present at the time of entry. So if he entered without intent to commit a crime, but later did, maybe it's not burglary but theft or something else.

Option B: The defendant threw a brick through a window to kill the homeowner. He was angry because the homeowner stole his girlfriend. So, he damaged the property by breaking the window, but the intent was to kill the person inside. Burglary usually involves entering a building. Here, he didn't enter; he just broke the window from outside. So maybe this isn't burglary because he didn't unlawfully enter; he just damaged the property. It might be attempted murder or vandalism, but not burglary.

Option C: The defendant broke into a hotel guest's room after the guest retired. He went in to threaten the guest about money owed. So, he entered the room without permission, and his intent was to threaten the guest about the money. Threatening someone can be a crime, like assault or intimidation. Since he entered unlawfully with the intent to commit a crime, this seems to fit the definition of burglary. The intent was present at the time of entry.

Wait, but in some places, burglary requires the intent to commit a felony. Threatening someone might be a misdemeanor, depending on the law. However, if the threat involves causing harm, it could be considered a felony intent. So, if the defendant intended to cause fear or bodily harm, it could count as a felony, making it burglary.

So, putting it together:

Option A: Entry was for shelter, so intent wasn't criminal at entry. Then he stole, but that's after entry. So maybe not burglary.

Option B: No entry; just breaking a window from outside. So not burglary.

Option C: Unlawful entry with intent to commit a crime (threatening), so likely burglary.

The correct answer is **C**. 

- **Option A**: The defendant entered the house to seek shelter, not with criminal intent. While he later stole a radio, the initial entry wasn't with the intent to commit a crime, so it doesn't constitute burglary.
- **Option B**: The defendant did not unlawfully enter the home but instead threw a brick through the window from outside. This is more about attempted murder and vandalism, not burglary.
- **Option C**: The defendant unlawfully entered the hotel room with the intent to threaten the guest about money owed. This fits the definition of burglary as it involves unlawful entry with criminal intent.

Answer: C
