Question:

While on vacation, two friends went scuba diving in the ocean. Each of them was equipped with a spear gun, which they planned to use to kill tuna. As they were swimming, both men saw what appeared to be a large fin entangled in a nearby coral reef. Simultaneously, they shot their spear guns at the projecting wing-like figure. Unbeknownst to either of the friends, it was not a fish but rather another scuba diver. The victim was struck and slightly wounded by one of the spears. The victim asserts a claim for damages against the two friends. At trial, the judge should instruct the jury to rule

Options:

A: against both defendants jointly unless one of them proves that he did not shoot the spear that struck the victim.
B: against each defendant for one-half of the amount of damages, because they both acted independently and not jointly.
C: in favor of both defendants if no evidence is presented showing who actually shot the spear that injured the victim.
D: against each defendant for one-half of the amount of damages, because they both shot their spear guns simultaneously.
E: in favor of the victim, as both defendants acted recklessly in a situation that required caution.
F: against the defendant who cannot prove he did not shoot the spear, while the other defendant is exempt from damages.
G: against each defendant for one-third of the amount of damages, with the remaining one-third to be determined by the jury.
H: in favor of both defendants if the victim cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt who shot the spear that injured him.
I: against both defendants for the full amount of damages, as they were both responsible for the situation.

Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about tort law, specifically regarding joint and several liability. Two friends were scuba diving and both shot a spear gun at what they thought was a fish, but it turned out to be another diver who was injured. The injured diver is suing both friends for damages. The question is about how the judge should instruct the jury to rule.

First, I need to recall the principles of joint and several liability. In tort law, when two or more people commit a tortious act that causes injury, they can be held jointly and severally liable. This means the plaintiff can recover the full amount of damages from any one or both of the defendants. Each defendant is responsible for the entire harm, and if one pays the full amount, the others can be pursued for the remainder.

Now, looking at the facts: both friends acted simultaneously, each shot their spear gun. They thought it was a fish but it was a diver. The victim was struck by one of the spears, but it's unclear who shot it. So, the issue is whether both are liable, and if so, how.

The key here is whether their actions were part of a joint venture or if they acted independently. If they planned together to use the spear guns, that might indicate joint liability. However, the problem states that each was equipped with a spear gun and planned to use it to kill tuna. They saw the fin and both shot simultaneously. It doesn't say they discussed or agreed on how to approach it, but their actions were in response to the same perceived threat.

In tort law, if two people commit an act that causes injury, even if they act independently, they can still be jointly and severally liable if their actions were so similar or connected that it's impossible to determine who caused the harm. This is especially true if their actions combined to cause the injury, even if each couldn't have caused it alone. But here, only one spear hit the victim, so maybe each shot was a separate act, but the harm was caused by one.

However, since it's impossible to tell who shot the victim, the doctrine of joint and several liability applies. The plaintiff doesn't have to prove which defendant caused the injury; they just have to show that the injury resulted from the defendants' actions. Each defendant can be held liable for the full amount, and if one pays, the others are still responsible for the remaining amount.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Against both jointly unless one proves they didn't shoot. This aligns with joint and several liability because the defendants have to prove they're not responsible, which is a high burden. So the plaintiff doesn't need to prove who did it; the defendants must show they didn't.

Option B: Each pays half because they acted independently. This might apply if they were not joint actors but separate. But since their actions were in the same situation, aiming at the same target, the court might find joint liability, not several. But I'm not sure; sometimes if their acts are independent, they could be liable for their own shares, but in this case, since the harm was a single injury, maybe each is liable for the full amount.

Option C: In favor of both if no evidence who shot. No, because the victim doesn't have to prove who did it; the burden shifts to the defendants to prove they didn't.

Option D: Each pays half because they shot simultaneously. This seems to suggest several liability, splitting the damages. But I think joint liability would require each to pay the full amount.

Option E: In favor of the victim because both acted recklessly. This is a possibility because reckless conduct is a basis for liability. But the question is about how the judge instructs the jury on joint liability, not just whether they are liable.

Option F: Against the one who can't prove they didn't shoot. So one might be liable, and the other not. But in joint and several liability, both can be held liable unless they can prove they didn't cause the harm. So if one can prove they didn't, only the other is liable. But this might not cover the situation where both might not have proof.

Option H: In favor of both if the victim can't prove beyond reasonable doubt. The burden of proof in civil cases is usually by a preponderance of evidence, not beyond a reasonable doubt. So the victim doesn't need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, just more likely than not.

So, focusing back on joint and several liability, the correct instruction would be that the defendants are jointly and severally liable. Therefore, the jury should rule against both unless each can prove they didn't cause the injury. That matches option A.

The correct answer is A. The judge should instruct the jury that both defendants are jointly and severally liable unless one of them can prove they did not shoot the spear that injured the victim. This is because their actions were part of a joint venture, and under joint and several liability, each defendant can be held responsible for the full amount of damages.
