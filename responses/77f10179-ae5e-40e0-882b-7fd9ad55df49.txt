Okay, so I've got this group theory question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question has two statements, and I need to determine if each is true or false. Then, based on that, I'll choose the correct option from A to D.

Statement 1: If a group has an element of order 10, then it has elements of orders 1, 2, and 5.

Statement 2: If a group has an element of order 2 and an element of order 3, then it has an element of order 6.

Options are A: both true, B: both false, C: first true second false, D: first false second true.

Alright, let's tackle each statement one by one.

Starting with Statement 1. So, the group has an element of order 10. I remember that in group theory, the order of an element divides the order of the group, thanks to Lagrange's theorem. Also, the order of an element is the smallest positive integer n such that a^n = e, where e is the identity element.

If an element has order 10, that means the group must have an order that's a multiple of 10. Now, the possible orders of elements in the group are the divisors of 10, right? Because the order of any element divides the order of the group. So the divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10.

Wait, so does that mean that the group must have elements of all these orders? Well, not necessarily. Because the group could have an element of order 10, but maybe it doesn't have elements of order 2 or 5? Or does it?

Wait, no, if an element has order 10, then by definition, the cyclic subgroup generated by that element has order 10. So that subgroup must have elements of all orders that divide 10. So in that cyclic subgroup, there must be elements of order 1, 2, 5, and 10. So the group must have at least those elements.

Wait, but the group itself might not be cyclic. Oh, wait, but regardless, if the group has an element of order 10, then that element's cyclic subgroup will have elements of orders dividing 10. So the group must have elements of orders 1, 2, 5, and 10. So Statement 1 is saying that it has elements of orders 1, 2, and 5. Which is definitely true because the cyclic subgroup of order 10 will have elements with those orders. So Statement 1 is true.

Moving on to Statement 2: If a group has an element of order 2 and an element of order 3, then it has an element of order 6.

Hmm, I think this is about the product of two elements' orders when they commute, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, let me think. If a group has elements a and b where a has order 2 and b has order 3, and if a and b commute (i.e., ab = ba), then the element ab will have order equal to the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 3, which is 6. So in that case, the group would have an element of order 6.

But wait, what if a and b don't commute? Then the statement might not hold. Because if they don't commute, the product ab might not have order 6. So does the statement assume commutativity? Or does it hold regardless?

Wait, the statement doesn't specify that the group is abelian. So if the group is non-abelian, does having elements of order 2 and 3 necessarily mean there's an element of order 6?

Let me think of an example. Take the symmetric group S3. It has elements of order 2 (the transpositions) and order 3 (the 3-cycles). Now, in S3, does the product of a transposition and a 3-cycle have order 6? Wait, S3 has order 6, so any element's order must divide 6. The possible orders are 1, 2, 3, 6.

Wait, let's take a specific example. Let a = (1 2), which has order 2, and b = (1 2 3), which has order 3. Now, what's the order of ab? Let's compute ab.

ab is the composition of the permutation a followed by b. So applying b first, then a.

Wait, wait, actually, in permutation multiplication, it's function composition, so ab is a after b. So b is (1→2→3→1), and a is (1→2)(2→1), which swaps 1 and 2.

So ab would be a permutation that first applies b, then a.

Let me compute ab as a permutation. Let's see:

Take 1: apply b → 1→2, then apply a: 2→1. So 1 maps to 1.

Take 2: apply b → 2→3, then apply a: 3 is not affected by a, so 2→3.

Take 3: apply b → 3→1, then apply a: 1→2. So 3→2.

So ab is the permutation: 1→1, 2→3, 3→2. So that's the transposition (2 3), which has order 2.

Wait, so ab has order 2, not 6. So in this case, even though the group has elements of order 2 and 3, their product doesn't have order 6. So does S3 have an element of order 6? Well, S3 has order 6, so if it had an element of order 6, that element would generate the entire group. But S3 is non-abelian, and its elements have orders 1, 2, 3, and the identity. Wait, no, the only elements are the identity (order 1), the transpositions (order 2), and the 3-cycles (order 3). So there is no element of order 6 in S3. Therefore, Statement 2 is false because even though the group has elements of order 2 and 3, it doesn't have an element of order 6.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me confirm. S3 has order 6, so by Cauchy's theorem, it must have elements of order 2 and 3, which it does. But no element of order 6 because it's not cyclic. So in this case, the group doesn't have an element of order 6. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but the statement says "if a group has an element of order 2 and an element of order 3, then it has an element of order 6." So in S3, it's true that it has elements of order 2 and 3, but it doesn't have an element of order 6. Therefore, the statement is false.

Wait, but hold on. Let me think again. Suppose the group is abelian. In that case, if a group is abelian and has elements of order 2 and 3, then their product would have order 6, right? Because in an abelian group, the product of two elements of coprime orders would have order equal to the product. So in that case, the group would have an element of order 6.

But the statement doesn't specify that the group is abelian. So in non-abelian groups, this might not hold. So the statement is not necessarily true in general.

Another example: Take the dihedral group D3, which is isomorphic to S3 and has elements of order 2 and 3, but no element of order 6. So the statement is false.

So putting it together: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false. Wait, no—wait, wait, I thought Statement 1 was true. So the options are:

A: True, True
B: False, False
C: True, False
D: False, True

Wait, but I thought Statement 1 was true and Statement 2 was false, which would make the answer C: True, False.

Wait, but earlier I thought Statement 1 was true because if you have an element of order 10, its cyclic subgroup would have elements of orders 1, 2, 5, and 10. So the group must have elements of those orders. So yes, Statement 1 is true.

So, Statement 1: True, Statement 2: False. So the correct option is C: True, False.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about Statement 2, I thought the answer was False, which would make the option C correct. But let me just make sure I'm not making any mistake here.

Rechecking Statement 1: If a group has an element of order 10, then it must have elements of orders 1, 2, and 5. Yes, because the cyclic subgroup generated by that element will have all those orders. So Statement 1 is definitely true.

Statement 2: The group has elements of order 2 and 3. Does it have an element of order 6? As shown in S3, the answer is no. So Statement 2 is false.

So the two statements are True and False, so the answer is C.
</think>

The first statement is true because the cyclic subgroup generated by an element of order 10 must contain elements of orders 1, 2, 5, and 10. The second statement is false because, as shown in the symmetric group S3, having elements of orders 2 and 3 does not guarantee an element of order 6.
