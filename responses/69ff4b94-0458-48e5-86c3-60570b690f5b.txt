Okay, so I need to figure out what "adverse impact" means in the context of personnel selection. I remember from my HR class that adverse impact has to do with discrimination in hiring, but I'm not exactly sure of the specifics. Let me think through each option.

The question gives several options from A to J. I'll go through them one by one.

Option A says the total selection process results in equal results for all groups covered by law. Wait, that sounds like it's promoting equality, which is good. But I think adverse impact is about negative effects, so maybe A isn't it.

Option B: a group covered by law is hired at more than 80% of the best group. Hmm, more than 80% sounds positive. I thought adverse impact is when a group is underrepresented, not over. So B might not be correct.

Option C: adverse conditions exist for selection of groups covered by law. That seems a bit vague. I think it's more about the outcome rather than the conditions, so maybe not C.

Option D: a group not covered by law is hired at a higher rate than the best group. I'm not sure about this. It's about an uncovered group being higher, but I think the focus is on groups that are legally protected, so maybe D isn't right.

Option E: a group covered by law is hired at less than 80% of the best group. This sounds familiar. I recall something about the 80% rule, where if a group's hiring rate is below 80% of the highest group, it's considered adverse impact. So E could be the answer.

Option F: a group not covered is hired at less than 80% of the best. Again, it's about uncovered groups, but I think it's about covered groups, so F might not be correct.

Option G: the process results in unequal results for one or more covered groups. That sounds like it's talking about inequality, but I think it's more specific than that. Adverse impact isn't just any inequality but when it's below a certain threshold, like the 80% rule. So G might be part of it, but not the full definition.

Option H: interviews are adverse and cause differential rates. This seems similar to G but mentions interviews specifically. I think adverse impact can come from various parts of the process, not just interviews, so maybe H is too narrow.

Option I: adverse conditions for groups not covered. Again, it's about uncovered groups, which doesn't fit because the term is about protected groups.

Option J: interviews are favorable, leading to differential rates. That doesn't sound right because favorable would mean better rates, which isn't adverse impact.

Putting it together, the key point is the 80% rule. So the correct answer should be E: a group covered by law is hired at less than 80% of the group with the best selection rate.
