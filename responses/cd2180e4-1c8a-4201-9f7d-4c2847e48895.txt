Okay, so I need to figure out why economists use per capita figures when discussing growth. Let me think about what I know about economics and per capita measures.

Per capita means "per person," so it's a way of looking at data on a per-person basis. Common examples are GDP per capita, which divides a country's total economic output by its population. I remember that GDP per capita is often used to compare the economic well-being of different countries or regions.

Economists use various indicators to assess economic growth and development. They might look at total GDP, but that can be misleading because a larger GDP doesn't necessarily mean the people are better off. For example, a country with a large population might have a high GDP, but if the population is huge, the per capita GDP could be low, indicating that individuals aren't as wealthy on average.

So, using per capita figures like GDP per capita allows economists to see how much of the economic output is available per person. This helps in understanding the average standard of living or individual welfare. It's a more accurate measure because it accounts for population size, which can otherwise distort the picture of economic health.

Looking at the options:

A: Tracking businesses? I don't think per capita figures are about businesses. More about individuals.

B: Total wealth of the government? Per capita would relate to per person, not the government's total wealth. That seems more like government revenue or budget.

C: Measure growth more accurately and show individual welfare. This sounds right because per capita adjusts for population, making it a better indicator of individual economic standing.

D: Distribution of natural resources? That's more about how resources are spread, not directly related to per capita figures in growth discussions.

E: Richest individuals? No, per capita is an average, not about identifying the richest.

F: Simplify calculations? Maybe, but the main reason is probably more about accuracy and welfare.

G: Population growth? No, per capita figures are used to adjust for population, not to measure it.

H: Only for predicting trends? No, per capita is used for analysis, not just prediction.

I: Easier for the public? While it might be more understandable, the primary reason is accuracy in measuring growth.

J: Total output? No, total output is GDP, not per capita.

So the best answer is C. Per capita figures help measure growth accurately and show changes in individual welfare, which is crucial for understanding how economic growth affects people.
