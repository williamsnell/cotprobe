Okay, so I have this question about Nagel's claims regarding moral assessment. I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking what Nagel says people cannot be morally assessed for before reflection. The options are A through E, etc. Let me recall what Nagel has written about this.

From what I remember, Nagel discusses the idea that before reflecting on our actions, we might not be fully aware of their moral implications. He talks about how people often act without thinking, and thus their actions might not be subject to moral judgment in the same way as deliberate actions.

Looking at the options:

A: actions that affect only themselves. Hmm, I think Nagel might say that even actions affecting oneself can have moral implications, but maybe before reflection, people aren't assessing those. Not sure yet.

B: actions performed under duress. I think duress is usually an excuse, so maybe people aren't morally blamed for those. But is this what Nagel says? Not sure.

C: actions that do not violate anyone’s rights. If they don't violate rights, maybe they're morally neutral, so no assessment. But I'm not certain if Nagel would say that.

D: actions that benefit others. Beneficial actions are morally good, but the question is about inability to assess. Not sure.

E: what is due to factors beyond their control. Nagel might say that if factors beyond control cause the action, then it's not blameworthy. So maybe this is the answer.

Wait, but the question is about prior to reflection. So before thinking, people can't be assessed. So, for example, automatic actions or habits that aren't considered might not be subject to moral judgment.

Nagel's concept of "mitigating circumstances" might apply here. If an action is due to factors beyond control, like being forced or having a mental condition, then it's not blameworthy. So E could be right.

Another angle: prior to reflection, people might not have considered the moral aspects, so actions that are socially acceptable (F) or personal beliefs (G) might not be assessed either. But I think E is more about factors beyond control, which makes the action not subject to blame.

So, putting it together, the answer is likely E.

The answer is E. Nagel suggests that prior to reflection, people cannot be morally assessed for actions influenced by factors beyond their control, as these circumstances may mitigate moral responsibility.
