Question:

A police officer carries out hundreds of traffic stops every year. When his supervisor is reviewing the officerâ€™s records for the past year, he notices that the officer is equally likely to stop people of various genders, ages, and races. However, he is significantly more likely to write tickets for middle-aged white males with dark hair and eyes. When confronted with this fact, the officer truthfully states that he has no idea why that is, and that it must simply be a coincidence. Unbeknownst to the officer, this behavior is tied to the fact that these men look like his father, with whom he had an abusive relationship as a child. What psychological framework would directly address the unconscious bias in his behavior? 

Options:

A: Gestalt
B: Developmental
C: Biopsychological
D: Humanistic
E: Cognitive behavioral
F: Positive psychology
G: Evolutionary
H: Behaviorist
I: Social cognitive
J: Psychoanalytic

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this psychology question. Let me read it carefully and think through it step by step.

The question is about a police officer who stops a lot of people, and his supervisor notices that he tends to ticket middle-aged white males with dark hair and eyes more than others. The officer doesn't realize why and thinks it's a coincidence. But the reason is tied to these men looking like his father, who he had an abusive relationship with as a child. So, the question is asking which psychological framework addresses the unconscious bias in his behavior.

Hmm, the key here is that the officer's behavior is influenced by unconscious factors, specifically his past experiences with his father. So, this seems like it's about unconscious or implicit bias. I remember that different psychological frameworks deal with various aspects of behavior and cognition.

Let me go through the options:

A: Gestalt - This deals with how we perceive patterns and wholes, not sure about unconscious bias.

B: Developmental - Looks at growth and change across the lifespan. Might relate to how early experiences shape behavior, but perhaps not directly the unconscious part here.

C: Biopsychological - Focuses on biological factors affecting behavior, like brain functions. Not directly about unconscious social or learned biases.

D: Humanistic - Focuses on self-actualization and personal growth. Doesn't seem to address unconscious bias.

E: Cognitive behavioral - Deals with thoughts, behaviors, and how they influence each other. It's more about conscious thoughts and changing behaviors through awareness, but maybe not the best fit for unconscious factors.

F: Positive psychology - Focuses on positive aspects of life, strengths, and well-being. Doesn't seem related to unconscious bias.

G: Evolutionary - Looks at behaviors from an evolutionary perspective, like instincts. Not directly about learned or unconscious social biases.

H: Behaviorist - Focuses on observable behaviors and conditioning. It might explain the behavior through classical or operant conditioning, but not necessarily the underlying unconscious reasons tied to personal history.

I: Social cognitive - This deals with how people observe and learn from others, social interactions, and how cognitive processes and environments influence behavior. It might look at observational learning and how past experiences shape current actions. But I'm not sure if it's the best fit for unconscious bias tied to personal relationships.

J: Psychoanalytic - This framework deals with the unconscious mind, repression, and how past experiences and unconscious thoughts influence behavior. It seems directly related to the officer's behavior being influenced by his father's appearance, which is an unconscious factor.

Wait, so the question is about unconscious bias. Psychoanalytic theory, as I remember, is all about the unconscious mind and how it drives behavior, which fits here because the officer isn't aware that his father's image is influencing his actions.

Social cognitive might also be relevant because it involves learning from others and social environments, but it's more about observed behavior and cognitive processes rather than the unconscious aspects tied to personal history.

So, I think the answer is J: Psychoanalytic.

The question revolves around understanding the unconscious bias influencing the police officer's behavior, which stems from his childhood experiences with his abusive father. The psychological framework that directly addresses unconscious factors and how they shape behavior is psychoanalytic theory. This theory focuses on the unconscious mind and how past experiences and repressed emotions can influence current actions without the individual's awareness. Therefore, the correct answer is:

J: Psychoanalytic
