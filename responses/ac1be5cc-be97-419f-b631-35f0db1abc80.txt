Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Butler and what he said was impossible. I'm not super familiar with Butler's philosophy, but I remember he was a 18th-century Scottish philosopher. The question is asking which of the options A through J is something Butler claims is impossible.

Let me go through each option one by one. 

Option A: Do that which is good and not approve of it. Hmm, Butler might have something about approval being tied to actions. I think he believed that our approvals and disapprovals are connected to our actions, especially in terms of self-love and conscience. So maybe it's impossible to do a good thing without approving of it.

Option B: Be motivated by genuine benevolence. I'm not sure. Butler talks about self-love and conscience, but I don't think he said it's impossible to be genuinely benevolent. People can have altruistic motives, right?

Option C: Approve of others' actions without understanding them. That seems a bit tricky. Butler might say that understanding is necessary for true approval. So maybe this is something he thought was impossible because you can't just approve without knowing why.

Option D: Act without a sense of self-interest. Butler did talk about self-love as a key motivator, so perhaps he thought it's impossible to act without considering self-interest. But wait, isn't that a bit too deterministic? Maybe people can act selflessly, but Butler might argue that even selfless acts are done in self-interest in some way.

Option E: Feel empathy without taking action. I don't think Butler addressed this specifically. Empathy is more about emotional understanding, and he was more focused on ethics and motivation. So I'm not sure if this is the right choice.

Option F: Approve of others' actions without imitating them. I'm not certain, but Butler might have thought that approval affects our behavior, so maybe you can't approve without being influenced to imitate, making this impossible.

Option G: Have morality without a conscience. That sounds plausible. Butler probably linked morality with having a conscience; without it, you can't have true moral judgment.

Option H: Act against societal norms. I don't recall Butler saying this was impossible. People can choose to act differently, though it might be against their self-interest or conscience.

Option I: Do something you don't approve of. This seems counterintuitive. If Butler's theory is that our actions are guided by our approvals, then doing something without approving would be impossible. So maybe I is the answer.

Option J: Perceive the good without desiring it. That rings a bell. Butler might argue that perceiving the good inherently leads to desiring it because of how our minds are structured. So perceiving without desiring would be impossible.

Wait, now I'm a bit confused between options A, I, and J. Let me think again.

Butler's main ideas: He talked about the principle of self-love and conscience. He also discussed the idea that our approvals and disapprovals are natural and necessary for our actions. He might have said that we can't do something good without approving of it because approval is tied to our motivation.

In his "Fifteen Sermons," Butler discusses how self-love and conscience work together. So if you do something good, you must approve of it because that's how your conscience works. So option A says it's impossible to do good without approving, which aligns with that.

Alternatively, option J says it's impossible to perceive the good without desiring it. Butler might argue that perceiving the good (i.e., knowing what's right) naturally leads to wanting to do it, so you can't just know without desiring.

Wait, but the question is about what's impossible. So if Butler said it's impossible to perceive the good without desiring it, then J is the answer. Or if he said you can't do good without approving, then A is the answer.

I think the key is in the phrasing. The question is about impossibility. Butler probably argued that you can't do a good action without approving of it because approval is part of the same process. So doing it without approval would be impossible.

So the answer would be A: do that which is good and not to approve of it.

According to Butler, it is impossible to do that which is good and not to approve of it, as approval is inherently tied to our actions and motivations.
