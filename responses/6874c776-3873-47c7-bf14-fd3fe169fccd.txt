Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a snowball being thrown at a tree trunk, and I need to find the speed it must travel to melt upon impact. The question gives me the specific heat of fusion of ice as 79.7 cal/g. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I remember that when the snowball hits the tree, the kinetic energy it has is converted into heat, which then melts the snowball. Since we're disregarding frictional heat loss, all the kinetic energy goes into melting the snowball.

So, the kinetic energy (KE) of the snowball is equal to the heat required to melt it. The kinetic energy is given by (1/2)mv², and the heat required is the mass times the specific heat of fusion.

Let me write down the equations. The kinetic energy is KE = (1/2)mv². The heat needed to melt the snowball is Q = m * L, where L is the specific heat of fusion. So, setting them equal: (1/2)mv² = m * L.

Wait, I can cancel out the mass m from both sides because it's the same on both. That leaves me with (1/2)v² = L. So v² = 2L, and v = sqrt(2L). But wait, L is given in calories per gram, and I need to make sure the units are consistent. Oh right, because I'm working in SI units, I might need to convert calories to joules.

Hmm, 1 calorie is approximately 4.184 joules. So the specific heat of fusion L is 79.7 cal/g multiplied by 4.184 J/cal. Let me calculate that.

79.7 * 4.184 ≈ let's see. 80 *4 is 320, but more accurately: 79.7 *4.184. Let me compute step by step. 70*4.184=292.88, 9.7*4.184≈40.4072, so total is about 292.88 +40.4072 = 333.2872 J/g.

So L ≈ 333.29 J/g.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the snowball is at -15°C. Does that mean we also have to account for warming it up to 0°C before melting? Oh, right! Because the snowball is initially at -15°C, it needs to absorb heat to raise its temperature to 0°C, and then more heat to melt it.

Oh, right. So I missed that part earlier. So the total heat Q is the sum of two parts: Q1 to raise the temperature from -15°C to 0°C, and Q2 to melt it.

So Q_total = m * c_ice * ΔT + m * L.

Where c_ice is the specific heat capacity of ice, which I think is about 2.09 J/g°C.

So ΔT is 15°C, since it goes from -15 to 0.

So putting it all together:

(1/2)mv² = m * c_ice * ΔT + m * L.

Again, m cancels out, so:

(1/2)v² = c_ice * ΔT + L.

Now plug in the numbers.

c_ice = 2.09 J/g°C,

ΔT = 15°C,

L = 333.29 J/g.

So,

(1/2)v² = (2.09 * 15) + 333.29.

Calculate 2.09 *15: 2.09 *10=20.9, 2.09*5=10.45, so total 31.35.

So 31.35 + 333.29 = 364.64.

Thus, (1/2)v² = 364.64 → v² = 729.28 → v = sqrt(729.28) ≈ let's see, 27^2=729, so sqrt(729.28) is about 27 m/s? Wait that can't be right because the options are in the hundreds or thousands of m/s. Wait, wait, wait, no! Did I make a mistake with units?

Wait, wait a second. No, because 2.09 J/g°C times 15 gives 31.35 J/g, and L is 333.29 J/g, so sum is 364.64 J/g. So (1/2)v² equals that, so v² is 729.28 J/g. Wait, but that's (v in m/s)^2 equals 729.28? That can't be right because 27^2 is 729, so v would be about 27 m/s, but the options are way higher.

Wait, I must have messed up the unit conversion. Let me recheck.

Wait, the specific heat of fusion is given as 79.7 cal/g. So 79.7 cal/g multiplied by 4.184 J/cal is indeed approximately 333.29 J/g.

But wait, the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², and the heat is in J/g, but wait, m is in grams? Or is it in kg? Wait, in physics, usually, mass is in kg, velocity in m/s, so let me make sure.

Wait, so the mass m in the kinetic energy equation is in kg, and the specific heat capacity is per gram. So perhaps I need to adjust units.

Wait, the problem says the snowball is at -15°C, but doesn't specify its mass. Wait, because in the equation, the mass cancels out, so it's independent of mass. So the speed only depends on the heat required per gram, multiplied by mass, but since m cancels, the speed is the same regardless of the mass.

But wait, let me think again.

Wait, the heat required is m * c_ice * ΔT + m * L. So it's m*(cΔT + L). And kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². Setting them equal:

(1/2)mv² = m (cΔT + L). So m cancels, v² = 2(cΔT + L).

Wait, but c is in J/(g°C), and L in J/g. So to get units right, perhaps I should express everything per gram, and then multiply by mass, but mass cancels.

Wait, but no, because (cΔT + L) is in J/g, so when multiplied by mass m (in grams), you get J. So that's correct.

But wait, when I compute v, I'm getting around 27 m/s. But that's way lower than any of the options, which are all in the hundreds or thousands.

So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the numbers.

Wait, 79.7 cal/g is the heat of fusion. So 79.7 cal/g * 4.184 J/cal ≈ 79.7 *4.184.

Let me compute that more accurately. 79 times 4 is 316, 0.7 *4=2.8. So 79*4.184=79*(4 +0.184)=79*4 +79*0.184.

79*4=316.

79 * 0.184: 70*0.184=12.88, 9*0.184=1.656. Total 12.88+1.656=14.536.

So 79 *4.184=316 +14.536=330.536 J/g.

Plus 0.7 *4.184= approximately 2.9288 J/g. So total L=79.7 cal/g is 330.536 +2.9288≈333.4648 J/g.

Then c_ice * ΔT is 2.09 J/(g°C) * 15°C=31.35 J/g.

So total Q per gram is 31.35 +333.4648=364.8148 J/g.

So (1/2)v² = 364.8148 J/g.

Wait, but v² is in (m/s)^2, which is (m^2/s^2). So 364.8148 J/g is per gram, but I'm not sure if I'm handling the units correctly.

Wait, no, because the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², which is in J, and the heat is m * Q (in J). So the units work out because m is in kg, but let me check.

Wait, let me express everything in SI units.

c_ice is 2.09 J/(g°C), which is 2090 J/(kg°C).

ΔT is 15°C, so Q1 = m * c_ice * ΔT = m * 2090 *15 J.

Then Q2 = m * L = m * 333,464.8 J/kg (since L is 333.4648 J/g, which is 333,464.8 J/kg).

So total Q = m * (2090 *15 + 333,464.8) = m * (31,350 + 333,464.8) = m * 364,814.8 J/kg.

Kinetic energy is (1/2)mv² = 0.5 * m * v².

Set equal: 0.5 * m * v² = m * 364,814.8.

Cancel m: 0.5 v² = 364,814.8 → v² = 729,629.6 → v = sqrt(729,629.6) ≈ approx 854 m/s.

Wait, because sqrt(729,629.6) is sqrt(729.6296e3) ≈ 854 m/s.

Looking at the options, F is 853 m/s, which is very close.

To determine the speed at which the snowball must travel to melt upon impact, we equate its kinetic energy to the total heat required to raise its temperature from -15°C to 0°C and then to melt it. The kinetic energy is given by \( KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \), while the heat required is \( Q = m \cdot c_{\text{ice}} \cdot \Delta T + m \cdot L \), where \( c_{\text{ice}} = 2.09 \, \text{J/g°C} \), \( \Delta T = 15 \, \text{°C} \), and \( L = 79.7 \, \text{cal/g} \). Converting \( L \) to joules, \( L \approx 333.46 \, \text{J/g} \). Setting \( KE = Q \), the mass \( m \) cancels out, leaving:

\[
\frac{1}{2}v^2 = c_{\text{ice}} \cdot \Delta T + L
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{1}{2}v^2 = (2.09 \cdot 15) + 333.46
\]

\[
\frac{1}{2}v^2 = 31.35 + 333.46 = 364.81 \, \text{J/g}
\]

\[
v^2 = 2 \cdot 364.81 = 729.62 \, \text{J/g}
\]

\[
v = \sqrt{729.62} \approx 854 \, \text{m/s}
\]

The closest option is **F: 853 m/s**.
