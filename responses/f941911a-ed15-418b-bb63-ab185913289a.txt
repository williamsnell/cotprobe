Okay, so I have this question about executory contracts, and I need to figure out which option is the least correct. Let's start by understanding what each term means because I'm a bit confused about the different types.

First, I remember that executory contracts are those where performance is required from both parties. The question is asking which statement is incorrect regarding these contracts. There are options from A to J, each describing different states of the contract.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: A fully executory contract is when both parties have completed their performance. Hmm, that sounds right. If both have performed, then it's fully executed. So A is correct.

Option B: Partially executed means both have started but not completed. That makes sense because if both have begun but neither has finished, it's still in the middle. So B is correct.

Option C: Executory contract is when one has performed and the other hasn't begun. Wait, no. An executory contract is when both are still to perform. If one has performed and the other hasn't started, isn't that a different state, maybe a partially performed contract? So C might be incorrect.

Option D: Executed contract exists when both have fully performed. That's the same as fully executed, so D is correct.

Option E: Partially executed means at least one party has begun performance. Yes, because if at least one has started, it's partially done. So E is correct.

Option F: Partially executory when one has begun and the other has completed. Wait, if one has completed, then that party's obligation is done. But if the other hasn't begun, then the contract isn't executed yet. Or is this possible? Wait, if one has completed, and the other only started, maybe that's a partial execution. Or maybe not. I'm not sure yet. Let me think again. If one party has completed and the other has begun but not completed, then the contract is partially executed because the other party hasn't finished. So F might be correct, but I'm not certain yet.

Option G: Fully executed when neither has obligations. That's the same as fully performed, so G is correct.

Option H: Partially executed when one has completed and the other has only promised. Wait, if one has completed, and the other hasn't started, then the contract isn't executed yet. Because the other party hasn't performed. So H seems incorrect. If one has completed, the other must have started or not? Wait, if one party has completed, but the other hasn't begun, that would mean the other party hasn't started, so the contract isn't executed yet. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Wholly executory is when only promises have been exchanged, no performance. That's correct because it's the initial state. So I is correct.

Option J: Executory contract when both haven't begun. Yes, that's the definition of an executory contract. So J is correct.

Wait, so looking back, the question asks for the least correct option. So which options are incorrect.

Option C says an executory contract is when one has performed and the other hasn't begun. That's not right because an executory contract is when both are yet to perform. So C is incorrect.

Option H says partially executed when one has completed, and the other has only promised. That's also incorrect because if one has completed, the other must have started or not. If the other hasn't started, then they haven't performed, so it's not partially executed. So H is incorrect.

Wait, so both C and H might be incorrect. But the question asks for the least correct, meaning which one is the incorrect statement.

Wait, let me clarify:

An executory contract is when both have yet to perform. So any option that describes a situation where one has performed is not an executory contract. So:

Option C says executory when one has performed and the other hasn't begun. That's wrong because executory means both are to perform. So C is wrong.

Option H says partially executed when one has completed and the other only promised. That's also wrong because if one has completed, the other must have started, but if the other hasn't started, then the contract isn't executed yet. So H is also wrong.

Wait, but the question is asking which is the least correct. So both C and H are incorrect. But perhaps only one is the answer.

Wait, the options are about the least correct, so perhaps only one is incorrect.

Wait, let me think again.

Option F: Partially executory when one has begun and the other has completed. That would mean one has performed (completed) and the other has begun but not completed. So in that case, the contract is partially executed because one has done their part, and the other is still working on theirs. So F is correct.

Option C: An executory contract is when one has performed and the other hasn't begun. That's incorrect because executory contracts are when both have yet to perform. So C is wrong.

Option H: Partially executed when one has completed and the other only promised. That would mean the other hasn't started, so the contract isn't executed yet. So H is incorrect.

Wait, but the question is which is the least correct, i.e., the incorrect statement.

So both C and H are incorrect. But perhaps only one is the answer.

Wait, let me check the options again.

The question is about which is the least correct, so the incorrect statement.

Looking back, the options are:

C: An executory contract is when one party has performed and the other party has not yet begun performance.

This is incorrect because an executory contract is when both have yet to perform.

H: A partially executed contract means that one party has completed performance while the other party has only promised.

This is also incorrect because if one party has completed, the other must have started, so it's not possible for the other to have only promised.

Wait, but in reality, if one party has completed their performance, the other party must have begun, right? Because the contract requires mutual performance. So if one has completed, the other must have started, even if not completed. So H is incorrect.

So the options that are incorrect are C and H. But the question asks for the least correct, so perhaps only one is intended.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Option C says "An executory contract is when one party has performed and the other party has not yet begun performance." That's incorrect because executory contracts are when both are to perform. So C is incorrect.

Option H says "A partially executed contract means that one party has completed performance while the other party has only promised." That's also incorrect because if one has completed, the other must have started. So H is incorrect.

But the question is which is the least correct, meaning which statement is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the answer is both C and H, but the options only allow for one.

Looking at the options again, perhaps the answer is C.

Wait, let me think: The question is about executory contracts. So which option is incorrect regarding them.

Option C: An executory contract is when one party has performed and the other hasn't begun. That's incorrect because executory contracts are when both have yet to perform. So C is wrong.

Option H: Partially executed when one has completed and the other only promised. That's also wrong because if one has completed, the other must have started, making it partially executed. So H is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look for the answer.

Wait, the correct answer is option C. Because an executory contract is when both have yet to perform. So any option that says one has performed is incorrect.

Similarly, option H is incorrect, but perhaps the answer is C.

Wait, perhaps the least correct is option C, because it's describing an executory contract as when one has performed, which is wrong.

So the answer is C.

The question asks which statement about executory contracts is least correct. An executory contract is defined as one where both parties are still required to perform. Letâ€™s analyze the options:

- **A**: Correct. A fully executory contract occurs when both parties have completed their performance.
- **B**: Correct. A partially executed contract means both parties have begun but not completed performance.
- **C**: Incorrect. An executory contract is when both parties have yet to perform. If one party has performed and the other has not begun, the contract is no longer executory.
- **D**: Correct. An executed contract exists when both parties have fully performed and no obligations remain.
- **E**: Correct. A partially executed contract means at least one party has begun performance.
- **F**: Correct. A partially executory contract occurs when one party has begun performance and the other has completed it.
- **G**: Correct. A fully executed contract exists when neither party has remaining obligations.
- **H**: Incorrect. A partially executed contract cannot occur if one party has completed performance while the other has only promised, as the latter would imply the other party has not yet begun.
- **I**: Correct. A wholly executory contract is where only promises have been exchanged, with no performance yet.
- **J**: Correct. An executory contract is when both parties have yet to begin performance.

The least correct statement is **C**, as it contradicts the definition of an executory contract.

Answer: C
