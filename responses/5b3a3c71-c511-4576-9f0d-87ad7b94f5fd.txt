Okay, so I've got this question about the times-interest-earned ratio, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The company has an income after tax of $5.4 million. Hmm, wait, that's the net income, right? Because after tax means after paying taxes. Then there's an interest expense of $1 million for the year. Depreciation expense is also $1 million. Oh, and the tax rate is 40%. They're asking for the times-interest-earned ratio.

I remember that the times-interest-earned ratio, also known as the interest coverage ratio, measures how many times a company can pay its interest expenses with its earnings. So it's a way to assess the company's ability to meet its interest obligations.

The formula for times-interest-earned (TIE) ratio is usually EBIT divided by interest expense. But wait, sometimes I've heard it being calculated using EBITDA, but I think in this case, it's just EBIT.

Wait, but the problem gives me net income, not EBIT. So I need to calculate EBIT from the given data.

Net income is after tax. So I know that net income = EBIT - interest expense - taxes. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The correct formula is:

Net income = (EBIT - Interest Expense - Taxes) + Non-cash expenses like depreciation.

Wait, no, actually, EBIT is already earnings before interest and taxes. So Net income is calculated as EBIT minus interest and taxes, but considering other factors. Wait, perhaps I should start from the top.

Let me think about the income statement structure. The typical order is:

Revenue
- Cost of goods sold (COGS)
= Gross profit
- Operating expenses (like salaries, rent, etc.)
= EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes)
- Interest expense
= EBITDA?
Wait, no, EBITDA is EBIT plus Depreciation and Amortization. So I think EBIT is already before interest and taxes.

Given that, the net income is calculated as EBIT minus interest expense and taxes.

Wait, but the net income is given as $5.4 million, which is after tax. So I need to find EBIT, which is before interest and taxes.

Let me set up the equation. Net income = (EBIT - Interest Expense) * (1 - Tax Rate). Because EBIT minus interest is the profit before tax, then you apply the tax rate.

So Net income = (EBIT - Interest) * (1 - Tax Rate).

We can rearrange this to solve for EBIT.

Given that, let's plug in the numbers.

Net income = $5.4 million
Interest expense = $1 million
Tax rate = 40%, so 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.

So 5.4 = (EBIT - 1) * 0.6

We can solve for EBIT.

Divide both sides by 0.6: 5.4 / 0.6 = EBIT -1
5.4 / 0.6 is 9, so 9 = EBIT - 1
Therefore, EBIT = 10 million.

Wait, that seems high, but let's go with it for now.

Now, the times-interest-earned ratio is EBIT divided by Interest Expense.

So TIE = EBIT / Interest = 10 / 1 = 10.

Looking at the options, J is 10.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I miss something? Because sometimes people use EBITDA, which is EBIT + Depreciation + Amortization. But in this problem, the depreciation is given as $1 million, but I'm not sure if that comes into play here.

Wait, in the calculation above, I used EBIT, which I got as $10 million. But the formula for TIE is EBIT / Interest, which would be 10 / 1 = 10, which is option J.

But I'm a bit confused because sometimes people include EBITDA, but I think the standard formula uses EBIT. Let me check.

Yes, the standard times-interest-earned ratio uses EBIT, not EBITDA. So I think my approach is correct.

So the answer should be J: 10.
</think>

The times-interest-earned ratio is calculated using EBIT divided by interest expense. To find EBIT, we use the net income formula: Net income = (EBIT - Interest) * (1 - Tax Rate). Plugging in the values, we find EBIT to be $10 million. Dividing this by the interest expense of $1 million gives a ratio of 10.

Answer: J
