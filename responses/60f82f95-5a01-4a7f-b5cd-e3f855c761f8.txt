Okay, so I need to find the poles of this digital filter. The equation given is y(n) = 1/3 [x(n) + x(n-1) + x(n-2)]. Hmm, right, poles in a filter's system function are important for determining its stability and response. 

First, I remember that for a digital filter, the system function H(z) is the ratio of the output Y(z) to the input X(z) in the z-domain. So I need to find H(z) for this equation.

The given equation is a finite impulse response (FIR) filter because the output depends only on the current and past inputs, not past outputs. FIR filters have system functions that are polynomials in the numerator and 1 in the denominator, so their poles are all at z = 0, but wait, that's only if it's a simple moving average. Wait, no, actually, the denominator would be 1, so the poles would be where the denominator is zero. But wait, if it's an FIR filter, the denominator is 1, so there are no poles except possibly at infinity, but usually, for such finite response filters, the poles are only at z=0 if it's a higher order, but maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, maybe I should approach this more methodically. Let me convert the difference equation into the z-domain. The equation is y(n) = (1/3)x(n) + (1/3)x(n-1) + (1/3)x(n-2). 

Taking the z-transform of both sides, Y(z) = (1/3)X(z) [1 + z^{-1} + z^{-2}]. So H(z) is Y(z)/X(z) = (1/3)(1 + z^{-1} + z^{-2}).

Wait, but that's a numerator polynomial. So H(z) = (1/3)(1 + z^{-1} + z^{-2}) / 1. So the denominator is 1, which is a constant. That means there are no poles except perhaps z=0 if there are any zeros there. Wait, no, poles are where the denominator is zero. Since the denominator is 1, it's not zero anywhere except if we have a pole at infinity, but in practical terms, this is a finite impulse response filter, and such systems have all their poles at z=0, but that's when it's a moving average with more terms. Wait, actually, no, for an FIR filter, the poles are all at z=0 if it's a causal system, but I think I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me write H(z) correctly. The expression is H(z) = (1/3)(1 + z^{-1} + z^{-2}) = (1/3)(z² + z + 1)/z². So H(z) = (z² + z + 1)/(3z²). The poles are the roots of the denominator, which is 3z². So setting denominator to zero: 3z² = 0 → z²=0 → z=0 (with multiplicity 2). So the poles are at z=0. But wait, the options don't have 0 as an option except for E. But looking at the options, E is 0, but maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up H(z). Let me check again. The original equation is y(n) = (1/3)(x(n) + x(n-1) + x(n-2)). Taking the z-transform:

Y(z) = (1/3)[X(z) + X(z)z^{-1} + X(z)z^{-2}] = (1/3)X(z)(1 + z^{-1} + z^{-2}).

So H(z) = Y(z)/X(z) = (1/3)(1 + z^{-1} + z^{-2}) = (1 + z^{-1} + z^{-2})/3.

To express this as a polynomial, I can write it as H(z) = (z² + z + 1)/(3z²). So the denominator is 3z², and the numerator is z² + z + 1. So the poles are the roots of the denominator, which is 3z² = 0 → z²=0 → z=0, as I thought earlier. So the poles are at z=0, but looking at the options, E is 0. But wait, the options only give a single pole, but this system has a pole of multiplicity 2 at zero. But the question says "the pole(s)", so maybe it's considering only the non-zero poles, but in this case, the denominator is 3z², so the poles are at zero.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the system is actually an infinite impulse response (IIR) filter. Wait, no, because the output y(n) depends only on the inputs, not on previous outputs, so it's an FIR filter, which typically has a system function with denominator 1, so no poles except at z=0. But wait, in that case, the denominator is 1, not 3z². Did I make a mistake in the z-transform?

Wait, perhaps I should represent it differently. Let me re-express H(z):

H(z) = (1/3)(1 + z^{-1} + z^{-2}) = (1/3) [1 + (1/z) + (1/z²)].

Alternatively, H(z) = (z² + z + 1)/(3 z²). So the denominator is 3z², which implies poles at z=0 of multiplicity 2. But the options don't have 0 as the only pole. Let me look again at the options. The options are A:1/2, B:3, C:-3, D:-2, E:0, F:-1, G:-1/2, H:1, I:1/3, J:2.

So E is 0. So the poles are at z=0, so the answer would be E:0.

Wait, but wait a second. I'm a bit confused because sometimes in filters, especially IIR, the poles are determined by the denominator. But in this case, since it's an FIR filter, the denominator is 1, so perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier step. Let me think again.

Wait, when taking the z-transform, for y(n) = sum of x(n-k) terms multiplied by coefficients, the system function is H(z) = sum of coefficients * z^{-k}. So in this case, H(z) is (1/3)(1 + z^{-1} + z^{-2}), which is correct. So the denominator is 1, as the system is FIR. Therefore, H(z) = (1/3)(1 + z^{-1} + z^{-2}) / 1, which means there are no poles except possibly at infinity, but in practice, for such systems, the poles are not considered except at z=0, but usually, the system is stable if all poles are inside the unit circle. But in this case, the denominator is 1, so there are no poles except at z=0 if considering the system as a rational function. Wait, but actually, in this representation, the poles are where the denominator is zero. Since the denominator is 1, it's a polynomial of degree 0, so no poles except possibly at infinity, but in practical terms, for an FIR filter, the system function is a polynomial in the numerator, and the denominator is 1, so there are no finite poles except if the system is not causal, which it is here.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating again. Let me think differently. Maybe the question is considering the system as an IIR filter, but it's not. Because the output depends only on the input terms, not previous outputs. So it's definitely an FIR filter. So the poles are at z=0, but perhaps the question is referring to other poles, but in this case, there are none. So the only pole is at z=0, which is option E.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the system function is expressed differently. Let me write H(z) as (z^2 + z + 1)/(3 z^2). So the denominator is 3 z^2. So the poles are the roots of 3 z^2 = 0 → z=0 (double pole). So the pole is at z=0. Therefore, the correct answer is E:0.

The equation of the digital filter is given as \( y(n) = \frac{1}{3}(x(n) + x(n-1) + x(n-2)) \). To determine the poles of the filter, we analyze the system function \( H(z) \), which is the ratio of the output \( Y(z) \) to the input \( X(z) \) in the z-domain.

Taking the z-transform of the given equation:

\[
Y(z) = \frac{1}{3}X(z)(1 + z^{-1} + z^{-2}).
\]

Thus, the system function is:

\[
H(z) = \frac{Y(z)}{X(z)} = \frac{1}{3}(1 + z^{-1} + z^{-2}).
\]

Rewriting \( H(z) \) as a polynomial:

\[
H(z) = \frac{z^2 + z + 1}{3z^2}.
\]

The poles of the filter are the roots of the denominator polynomial. Setting the denominator equal to zero:

\[
3z^2 = 0 \implies z^2 = 0 \implies z = 0.
\]

Therefore, the filter has a double pole at \( z = 0 \). Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**E: 0**
