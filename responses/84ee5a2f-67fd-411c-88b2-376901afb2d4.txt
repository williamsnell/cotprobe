Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that a saturated solution of the strong electrolyte Ca(OH)₂ is prepared by adding enough water to 5.0 × 10^-4 moles of Ca(OH)₂ to make 100 ml of solution. I need to find the pH of this solution. The options are given from A to J, with numbers like 6, 11, 13, etc.

First, I remember that Ca(OH)₂ is calcium hydroxide, which is also known as slaked lime. I think it's a strong base, so it should dissociate completely in water. But wait, I'm not entirely sure if it's a strong electrolyte. Oh, wait, the question says it's a strong electrolyte, so that confirms it.

So, the formula for calcium hydroxide is Ca(OH)₂. When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into ions. Let me write that out: Ca(OH)₂ → Ca²+ + 2 OH⁻. Right? Because calcium has a +2 charge, and each hydroxide ion has -1, so two OH⁻ per Ca²+.

Next, I need to find the concentration of OH⁻ ions in the solution because pH depends on that, especially since it's a basic solution. The solution is 100 ml, which is 0.1 liters.

The problem gives me 5.0 × 10^-4 moles of Ca(OH)₂. Since the solution is 100 ml, the concentration (molarity) of Ca(OH)₂ would be moles divided by liters. So that's (5.0e-4) / 0.1 = 5.0e-3 M. So 0.005 M Ca(OH)₂.

But wait, when Ca(OH)₂ dissociates, each mole gives one mole of Ca²+ and two moles of OH⁻. So the concentration of OH⁻ ions would be 2 times the concentration of Ca(OH)₂. That would make [OH⁻] = 0.01 M. Because 0.005 * 2 = 0.01.

Now, to find the pH, I can use the OH⁻ concentration to find pOH first, then convert to pH. The formula for pOH is -log[OH⁻]. So plugging in 0.01 M: pOH = -log(0.01).

Wait, log(0.01) is log(1e-2), which is -2. So pOH would be -(-2) = 2. Then, pH is 14 - pOH, which is 14 - 2 = 12. So the pH would be 12.

Looking at the options, option D is 12. So I think the answer is D.

Wait, but wait a second. I should make sure that Ca(OH)₂ is a strong electrolyte. I remember that strong electrolytes are those that dissociate completely in solution. Calcium hydroxide is indeed a strong base and a strong electrolyte, so it should dissociate completely. So my calculation should be correct.

Another thing to check: sometimes, people confuse the formula. For example, if it was Ca(OH) instead of Ca(OH)₂, but no, the formula given is Ca(OH)₂, so that's correct.

So to recap: moles of Ca(OH)₂ = 5e-4. Volume = 0.1 L, so concentration is 0.005 M. Each mole gives 2 moles of OH⁻, so OH⁻ is 0.01 M. pOH is 2, pH is 12. So answer D.

The solution involves calculating the concentration of OH⁻ ions from the dissociation of Ca(OH)₂. Since Ca(OH)₂ is a strong electrolyte, it dissociates completely into Ca²+ and 2 OH⁻ ions. The concentration of Ca(OH)₂ is 0.005 M, leading to an OH⁻ concentration of 0.01 M. Using pOH = -log(0.01) = 2 and pH = 14 - pOH = 12. 

Answer: D
