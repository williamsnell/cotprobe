Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. The sides are given in terms of x, and I need to find the measure of AB. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem states that AB is equal to 9x - 1, CB is 5x - 0.5, and AC is 4x + 1. Also, it's given that AC equals CB. Hmm, that's interesting because in a triangle, if two sides are equal, then it's an isosceles triangle, but I don't think that's directly relevant here. What's important is that AC equals CB, so I can set their expressions equal to each other and solve for x.

So, AC = CB translates to 4x + 1 = 5x - 0.5. Let me write that down:

4x + 1 = 5x - 0.5

Now, I need to solve for x. Let's subtract 4x from both sides to get the x terms on one side.

1 = x - 0.5

Then, add 0.5 to both sides to isolate x.

1 + 0.5 = x

Which means x = 1.5.

Wait, let me check that again. 4x +1 = 5x -0.5. Subtract 4x: 1 = x -0.5. Add 0.5: 1.5 = x. Yes, that's correct.

Now that I have x, I can substitute it back into the expressions for each side to find their lengths. The question asks for the measure of AB, which is 9x -1. So let's plug in x = 1.5 into that.

AB = 9*(1.5) -1

Calculating 9*1.5: 9 * 1 is 9, 9 * 0.5 is 4.5, so 9 + 4.5 = 13.5. Then subtract 1: 13.5 -1 = 12.5.

Wait, that gives me 12.5. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. 9 times 1.5 is indeed 13.5, and subtracting 1 gives 12.5.

Let me just double-check the other sides to make sure everything adds up, just to be thorough. 

AC is 4x +1. With x=1.5, that's 4*(1.5) +1 = 6 +1 =7. CB is 5x -0.5, so 5*(1.5) -0.5 = 7.5 -0.5 =7. Yep, that matches, so AC and CB are both 7 units long, which aligns with the given condition.

Now, AB is 12.5, which is option B. But wait, looking at the options, option B is 12.5. So that should be the correct answer.

But wait a second, let me just think if I made any mistakes in setting up the equation. The problem says AC equals CB, so I correctly set 4x+1 =5x -0.5. Solving that gives x=1.5. Then substituting into AB gives 12.5, which is option B. 

I think that's correct. The other sides make sense, so AB must be 12.5.

In triangle ABC, given AC = CB, we set 4x +1 =5x -0.5 and solve for x, finding x=1.5. Substituting x into AB=9x-1 gives AB=12.5. 

Answer: B
