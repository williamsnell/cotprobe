Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the free induction decay. The question says that the amplitude drops to 25% of its initial intensity after 1.0 second. I need to find the value of T2, assuming exponential relaxation and Ω equals zero. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that in free induction decay, the amplitude as a function of time is given by an exponential decay. The formula I think is something like A(t) = A0 * exp(-t/T2), right? Because T2 is the time constant for the decay. So, when Ω is zero, there's no oscillation, just a straight exponential decay.

The problem states that after 1 second, the amplitude is 25% of the initial. So, A(1) = 0.25 * A0. Plugging that into the formula: 0.25 A0 = A0 * exp(-1/T2). Oh, I can divide both sides by A0 to simplify: 0.25 = exp(-1/T2).

Now, to solve for T2, I need to take the natural logarithm of both sides. So, ln(0.25) = -1/T2. Wait, what's the natural log of 0.25? I think ln(1/4) is the same as ln(0.25). I remember that ln(1)=0, ln(e)=1, and ln(1/2) is about -0.693. So, 1/4 is (1/2)^2, so ln(1/4) = ln((1/2)^2) = 2*ln(1/2) = 2*(-0.693) ≈ -1.386.

So, ln(0.25) ≈ -1.386. Therefore, substituting back: -1.386 = -1/T2. Multiplying both sides by -1 gives 1.386 = 1/T2. So, T2 would be 1/1.386 ≈ 0.721 seconds? Wait, no, wait a second, that can't be right. Because wait, I have 1.386 = 1/T2, so T2 is 1 divided by 1.386, which is approximately 0.721. But wait, wait, that's not matching any of the options correctly. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.721 s, and option H is 1.661 s. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, let me go back. The formula is A(t) = A0 * exp(-t/T2). So, 0.25 = exp(-1/T2). Taking natural log: ln(0.25) = -1/T2. So, ln(0.25) is approximately -1.386. So, -1.386 = -1/T2. Multiplying both sides by -1: 1.386 = 1/T2. So, T2 = 1 / 1.386 ≈ 0.721 s. So that's option D.

Wait, but wait, that would make T2 approximately 0.721 seconds. Looking at the options, that's option D. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes T2 is related to the time constant, and sometimes it's the decay time. Wait, but I think I did it correctly. Because the formula is A(t) = A0 exp(-t/T2), so the time constant is T2. So, after time T2, the amplitude drops to 1/e, which is about 36.8% of the initial. But in this problem, it's dropping to 25%, which is less than 1/e, so the time must be longer than T2. Wait, no, because if it's after 1 second, and 25% is less than 1/e (~0.368), then 1 second must be longer than T2. So, T2 would be less than 1 second. Because at t=T2, the amplitude is 1/e, so if 25% is less than that, then the time taken is longer than T2. So, in our case, after 1 second, it's 25%, which is less than 1/e. So, 1 second is greater than T2. Therefore, T2 must be less than 1 second.

Wait, but according to my calculation, T2 is approximately 0.721 seconds. So that's correct. So, the answer should be option D: 0.721 s.

But wait, looking at the options, option H is 1.661 s. Did I make a mistake in the reciprocal? Because 1.386 is approximately ln(4), right? Because ln(4) is about 1.386. Wait, but 1.386 is correct as the natural log of 4 is about 1.386. So, T2 is 1/1.386 ≈ 0.721 s. So, that's correct.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps I should consider that the amplitude drops to 25% after 1 second, so the time constant T2 is such that after 1 second, it's 25% left. So, 25% is 0.25, so the decay is 0.75 (since 1-0.25=0.75). Wait, no, the amplitude is 25% of the initial, so it's 0.25*A0. So, the formula is correct as I applied it.

Wait, another approach: The general form is A(t) = A0 * e^(-t/T2). So, after time t, the amplitude is A0 multiplied by e^(-t/T2). So, when t=1, e^(-1/T2) = 0.25. So, taking natural logs: -1/T2 = ln(0.25). So, T2 = -1/ln(0.25) ≈ -1/(-1.386) ≈ 0.721 s. So, yes, T2 is 0.721 seconds, which is option D.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes people use T2* as the time to reach 1/e, but in this case, the problem is straightforward. So, I think the correct answer is D: 0.721 s.

The amplitude of a free induction decay follows an exponential decay model given by \( A(t) = A_0 e^{-t/T_2} \), where \( T_2 \) is the time constant. The problem states that the amplitude drops to 25% of its initial value after 1 second, i.e., \( A(1) = 0.25 A_0 \). Substituting this into the formula:

\[
0.25 = e^{-1/T_2}
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(0.25) = -1/T_2
\]

Since \( \ln(0.25) \approx -1.386 \), we have:

\[
-1.386 = -1/T_2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad T_2 = \frac{1}{1.386} \approx 0.721 \, \text{s}
\]

Thus, the value of \( T_2 \) is approximately 0.721 seconds, which corresponds to option D.
