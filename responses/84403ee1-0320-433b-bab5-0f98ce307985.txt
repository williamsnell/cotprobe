Question:

Police were conducting a house-to-house search for an escaped convict. During the search, a police officer went to a home and rang the doorbell. When a teenage male opened the door, the police officer told him that a convict had escaped and asked if he had seen anyone suspicious in the neighborhood. The teenager said he hadn't but then asked the police officer to come inside to ensure the house was safe. The police officer entered the home and proceeded to look around. When he went into the kitchen, the police officer noticed a bag containing white powder on the counter. Suspecting that the bag contained narcotics, the police officer questioned the teenager as to its contents. The teenager said he didn't live in the house and had never seen it before. The police officer confiscated the bag and took the teenager to the station house for questioning, at which time it was determined that the teenager had escaped from a psychiatric hospital and had broken into the home earlier in the day. Furthermore, the results of a police lab test found that the bag contained heroin. As a result, the police issued an arrest warrant for the owner of the home. He was apprehended and charged with possession of heroin. The homeowner's attorney has filed a motion to suppress, claiming that the heroin confiscated by the police was unlawfully obtained. The motion should be

Options:

A: denied, because the teenager gave consent for the police officer to enter and search the home.
B: denied, because the police officer reasonably believed that he had permission to enter the dwelling and reasonably believed that the teenager was competent to give consent.
C: granted, because the teenager did not have an ownership or shared occupancy interest in the premises.
D: denied, because the police officer reasonably believed that he had permission to enter the dwelling.
E: denied, because the police officer was invited into the home by the teenager.
F: granted, because the police officer did not have a warrant to search the house.
G: granted, because the police officer did not have probable cause to search the house.
H: denied, because the police officer suspected that the bag contained narcotics.
I: granted, because the homeowner was not present during the search.
J: granted, because the teenager did not have the authority to consent to a search of the house.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about whether the motion to suppress should be granted or denied. Let me break it down step by step.

The scenario is that police were searching for an escaped convict. An officer went to a home, rang the doorbell, and a teenage male answered. The officer told him about the escape and asked if he'd seen anyone suspicious. The teen said no but invited the officer in to check the house's safety. The officer entered and found a bag with white powder in the kitchen. He questioned the teen, who denied knowing about it. The officer took the bag and the teen to the station. It turned out the teen was an escaped psychiatric patient who broke into the home. Tests showed the bag had heroin, leading to the homeowner being charged. Now, the homeowner's lawyer wants to suppress the evidence because it was obtained unlawfully.

The issue is about consent to search. The key here is whether the teenager had the authority to consent to the police entering and searching the home. 

I remember from my studies that for a consent search to be valid, the person giving consent must have the authority to do so. If the person doesn't have a right to the property, their consent isn't valid. So, in this case, the teenager didn't own the house. He was just a trespasser who broke in earlier. Therefore, he didn't have the right to consent to a search of the home.

Looking at the options:

A: Says the teen gave consent. But since he didn't own the house, this might not be enough. So A might be incorrect.

B: Talks about reasonable belief and the teen being competent. But even if the officer believed he had permission, if the teen didn't actually have the authority, the consent is invalid. So B might not be the right answer.

C: Says it's granted because the teen didn't have ownership or shared occupancy. That makes sense because without that, his consent isn't valid. So C could be correct.

D: Similar to B, but only about permission to enter. Again, the issue is the teen's authority, not just permission.

E: Talks about being invited in. But invitation doesn't mean consent to search; it's about whether the invitee had the right.

F: Argues no warrant, but police don't always need a warrant if they have consent or probable cause. So F might not be the main issue here.

G: Probable cause isn't the issue here; it's about consent. The officer found the bag while searching, but the entry was based on consent.

H: Focuses on the suspicion of narcotics, but the problem is the legality of the search, not the contents found.

I: Homeowner wasn't present, but others can consent if they have the right. Since the teen didn't, I is not the main issue.

J: Says the teen lacked authority, which aligns with C. So J is another possible correct option.

Wait, so both C and J seem relevant. Let me check the options again. C says granted because the teenager didn't have ownership or shared occupancy. J says granted because the teen didn't have authority. Both seem correct, but perhaps the options are structured so that only one is correct. 

In the case of Florida v. Jardines, the Supreme Court ruled that bringing a drug-sniffing dog to the porch of a home is a search under the Fourth Amendment. But that's about the method of search, not consent. 

Another case, Minnesota v. Carter, held that a co-defendant in a drug case didn't have authority to consent to a search of a home he was visiting. So, if the person doesn't have a right of access, their consent is invalid.

In this case, the teen didn't own or share the home, so he couldn't consent. Therefore, the officer's entry was unlawful, making the evidence inadmissible. So the motion to suppress should be granted.

Looking back at the options, C and J both point to the teen's lack of authority. C says because he didn't have ownership or shared occupancy. J says because he didn't have authority. Both seem correct, but perhaps the options are structured so that only one is correct.

Wait, the options are A to J, each a separate choice. So I have to pick the best answer.

I think the correct answer is C or J. Let me read the options again.

Option C: granted because the teenager didn't have ownership or shared occupancy.

Option J: granted because the teenager didn't have the authority to consent to a search.

In some jurisdictions, even if you don't own the property, if you have some level of access (like a roommate or a guest with permission), you can consent. But here, the teen didn't have any ownership or shared occupancy. He was just an intruder. So he couldn't consent.

I think both C and J are correct, but perhaps the more precise answer is J, because it's about the authority to consent, not just ownership. However, in the options, C and J are both possible. But looking at the options, option C is phrased about ownership or shared occupancy, which is a key factor in determining authority.

Wait, perhaps looking at the case law, in cases where the defendant is not an owner but a co-tenant, their consent is valid. But if they're just a visitor without any right, their consent isn't valid.

So in this case, the teen had broken in, so he didn't have any right to the premises. Therefore, his consent to search was invalid. So the evidence should be suppressed.

So the motion should be granted, which points to options C, J, or possibly G, but G is about probable cause, which isn't the issue here.

I think the correct answer is J: granted because the teenager did not have the authority to consent to a search of the house.

The key issue is whether the teenager had the authority to consent to the police searching the home. Since he was an escaped convict who broke into the house and had no ownership or shared occupancy interest, he lacked the authority to consent. Therefore, the evidence obtained from the unlawful search should be suppressed.

Answer: J
