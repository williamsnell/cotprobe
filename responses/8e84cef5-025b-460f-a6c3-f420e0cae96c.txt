Question:

A biology student from Nebraska, vacationing at a Virginia beach, observes that the level of activity of a fiddler crab changes with the cycle of the tides. When he brings some crabs back with him to Nebraska, he notices that a similar activity cycle is shown, yet there are no ocean beaches for miles. Explain.

Options:

A: The level of activity is influenced by the ocean tides only
B: The activity cycle is a genetic trait that persists regardless of the crabs' habitat
C: The crabs' internal biological clocks are set to the tidal patterns they experienced in Virginia and continue on the same cycle
D: Changes in barometric pressure in Nebraska are influencing the crabs' activity levels
E: The level of activity is regulated by the crab's diet
F: The crucial determinant of the level of activity of the crab is not the presence of the tides, but the gravitational pull of the moon
G: The crabs are responding to the light cycles of day and night rather than the tides
H: The crabs have adapted to a freshwater rhythmic cycle that mimics ocean tides
I: The crabs are maintaining their Virginia activity schedule out of habit
J: The level of activity is being influenced by the temperature fluctuations in their new environment

Okay, so I have this biology question here about fiddler crabs and their activity levels. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that a biology student from Nebraska was vacationing in Virginia at a beach. He noticed that the fiddler crabs there were active according to the tides. Then he took some crabs back to Nebraska, and even though there are no ocean beaches nearby, the crabs still showed a similar activity cycle. I need to figure out why.

Hmm. So the key points are: the crabs were active with the tides in Virginia, and when moved to Nebraska, they kept the same activity cycle despite no ocean there. So what's causing their behavior?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Influenced by ocean tides only. But in Nebraska, there are no ocean tides, so this can't be right because the crabs are still active on the same cycle without the tides.

Option B: Genetic trait. That's possible because maybe the crabs have an internal clock tied to their genes. But I think tidal patterns are more about external cues, so maybe it's not just genetics.

Option C: Internal biological clocks set to tidal patterns. This makes sense because if the crabs were exposed to tidal cycles, their internal clocks might adjust. Even in a new environment without tides, their bodies might still follow that schedule.

Option D: Barometric pressure. I'm not sure how likely that is. Maybe weather affects them, but the question specifically mentions tides and activity, so this seems less likely.

Option E: Diet regulation. The question doesn't mention anything about diet changing, so probably not.

Option F: Gravitational pull of the moon. Well, tides are caused by the moon's gravity, so maybe the crabs are responding to that, not just the tides. But then why would they keep the same cycle in Nebraska? The moon's pull is the same everywhere, so maybe that's a factor, but I'm not sure if it's the main reason here.

Option G: Responding to light cycles. Crabs are diurnal or nocturnal, maybe. But the question links activity to tides, which are more about light indirectly, but I don't think light alone explains the tidal-linked activity.

Option H: Freshwater rhythmic cycle. Nebraska has rivers or lakes, but I don't think their cycles mimic tides. Tides are specific to oceans, so this might not apply.

Option I: Habit. They kept their schedule because they were used to it. That's possible, but I think it's more about internal rhythms than just habit.

Option J: Temperature. The question doesn't mention temperature changes, so probably not.

So now, thinking deeper: Fiddler crabs are typically found in tidal areas, so their activity is tied to the tides. When moved to a place without tides, like Nebraska, why would they still follow the same cycle?

Option C suggests their internal clocks are set to the tidal patterns. That seems plausible because many organisms have internal circadian rhythms, which can be set by external cues like light or in this case, tidal cycles. Once set, they might maintain that rhythm even without the external cue.

Option F is about the moon's gravity. Well, the moon's gravitational pull does create tides, but in Nebraska, the moon's effect on water is minimal because it's not an ocean. So the crabs wouldn't be experiencing the same tidal forces, but their internal clocks might still be running on the same schedule because of the earlier synchronization.

Wait, but the question says the activity cycle persists even without tides. So their behavior isn't tied to the presence of tides anymore. That points more towards an internal clock that was set by the tidal cycles but continues independently.

So, option C is about their internal clocks being set to the tidal patterns they experienced. That makes sense. Once their bodies are set to that schedule, they'll follow it even without the tides.

Alternatively, option F suggests it's the moon's pull. But the moon's influence is the same everywhere, so why would the crabs in Nebraska show the same activity as when they were in Virginia? Because their internal clocks are set to the tidal schedule, which is linked to the moon's phases.

Wait, but the moon's gravitational pull causes tides, so the crabs might be responding to the gravitational cycle. But once they're in Nebraska, the water isn't moving with the tides, so their internal clock, which was synced to the tidal cycle, might still run on that schedule.

But I think the more straightforward answer is option C: their internal biological clocks are set to the tidal patterns and continue the cycle. Because even without tides, their internal timer keeps them active on the same schedule.

So, I think the correct answer is C.

The crabs' activity cycle persists in Nebraska despite the absence of tides because their internal biological clocks were synchronized to the tidal patterns in Virginia. Once set, these clocks continue to regulate their behavior even without the external tidal cues. 

Answer: C
