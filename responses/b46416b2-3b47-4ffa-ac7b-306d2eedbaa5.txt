Okay, so I have this problem about computing the stress in a saw as it goes over a driving pulley. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, let me read the problem again. The saw is made of alloy steel with a modulus of elasticity E equal to 30 × 10^6 psi. The thickness is 1/32 of an inch. The pulley has a diameter of 15 inches. I need to find the stress in the saw when it's over the pulley, and the options are from A to J, with various psi values.

Wait, so the question is about belt or chain stress when it goes around a pulley. I remember that when a belt goes around a pulley, there's a certain amount of bending stress that occurs. I think the formula involves the bending moment and the radius of the pulley, and maybe the thickness of the material.

I recall that the bending stress (σ) can be calculated using the formula σ = (M * y) / I, but wait, maybe that's for beams. Alternatively, for a circular bend, the stress might be related to the curvature. Oh right, when a belt bends around a pulley, the stress can be approximated by σ = (E * t) / (8 * R), where E is the modulus of elasticity, t is the thickness, and R is the radius of the pulley.

Wait, let me think again. I'm trying to remember the correct formula. I think for a belt or a flexible member, the maximum stress due to bending when it goes around a pulley is given by σ = (E * t) / (8 * R). Alternatively, sometimes it's written as σ = (E * t) / (16 * R), but I'm not sure. I need to get this right.

Let me break it down. The radius R of the pulley is half the diameter, so 15 inches divided by 2 is 7.5 inches. The thickness t is 1/32 inch. E is 30 × 10^6 psi.

So plugging into the formula: σ = (E * t) / (8 * R). Let's compute that.

E is 30e6 psi, t is 1/32, R is 7.5.

So σ = (30e6 * (1/32)) / (8 * 7.5)

Let me compute the numerator first: 30e6 * (1/32) = 30e6 /32 ≈ 937,500 psi.

Then the denominator: 8 *7.5 =60.

So σ = 937500 /60 ≈ 15,625 psi.

Wait, that's 15,625 psi. Looking at the options, option B is 15,000 psi and option J is 20,000 psi. Hmm, 15,625 is closer to 15,000. But wait, maybe I used the wrong formula. Did I mix up the denominator?

Alternatively, maybe the formula is σ = (E * t) / (16 * R). Let me try that. So denominator becomes 16 *7.5=120.

Then σ = (30e6 *1/32)/120 = (937500)/120 ≈7812.5 psi. That's about 7,812.5 psi, which is close to option D:7,500 psi. But wait, I'm not sure if the formula uses 8 or 16. I need to check my notes.

Wait, I think the correct formula is σ = (E * t) / (16 * R). Because when a flexible member bends around a cylinder, the maximum stress is given by that formula. So maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate.

Using σ = (E * t) / (16 * R). So E=30e6, t=1/32, R=7.5.

Compute numerator: 30e6 *1/32 = 937,500.

Denominator:16 *7.5=120.

So 937,500 /120 = 7,812.5 psi. Hmm, that's about 7,812.5, which isn't exactly an option, but option D is 7,500. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider units or another factor.

Wait, perhaps I should check the formula again. Maybe I was wrong about the denominator. Another approach: the maximum stress in a belt around a pulley is often given by σ = (E * t) / (8 * R). So with R=7.5, that would be 30e6*(1/32)/(8*7.5). Let's compute that again.

30e6 /32 =937,500. 8*7.5=60. So 937500/60=15,625 psi. So that's about 15,625 psi. The options include B:15,000 and J:20,000. Since 15,625 is closer to 15,000, but maybe I need to see if the formula actually uses 8 or 16.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the derivation. When a belt is wrapped around a pulley, the maximum tensile stress occurs at the point where the belt is about to leave the pulley, and it's due to the bending. The formula is derived from beam bending, where the maximum stress is at the surface, so σ = (E * y) / (R), where y is the distance from the neutral axis. For a thin belt, the neutral axis is at the centerline, so y = t/2. So σ = (E * (t/2)) / R = (E * t)/(2 R). Wait, but that gives σ = (30e6 * (1/32)) / (2 *7.5) = (30e6/32)/(15) → 30e6/(32*15) = 30e6 /480 ≈62,500 psi. Hmm, that's option E:62,500 psi.

Wait, that's a different result. So maybe I was using the wrong formula earlier. Let me see. If I model the belt as a thin rectangular beam, the maximum stress due to bending would be σ = (E * t) / (2 R), because for a thin plate or beam, the maximum stress due to a radius of curvature R is σ = E * t/(2 R). Wait, but earlier I thought it was E t/(16 R) or something else.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting formulas. Let me think again. The general formula for the maximum stress in a thin plate due to bending around a cylinder is σ = E t/(2 R). So in this case, E is 30e6, t is 1/32, R is 7.5.

So σ = (30e6) * (1/32) / (2 *7.5) = (30e6 /32) / 15 = (30e6 / (32*15)) = 30e6 /480 ≈62,500 psi. So that would be option E:62,500 psi.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this applies to a saw. Maybe the saw is a different case, like a chain or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different because the saw is a link chain, and the stress is calculated differently.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about belt tension. The maximum stress in a belt is due to the tension difference between the tight and slack sides. But in this case, since it's just going over the pulley, maybe it's about the bending stress only.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the nominal stress due to the bending, which could be calculated using σ = (E * t) / (16 * R). Let me compute that again.

E=30e6, t=1/32, R=7.5.

So σ = (30e6 *1/32)/(16 *7.5) = (937500)/(120) ≈7,812.5 psi, which is about 7,812.5, close to 7,500 psi (option D). But I'm not confident because I'm getting conflicting formulas.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is σ = E t/(16 R). Let me double-check. For a circular ring or a thin-walled cylinder, the hoop stress is different, but for a belt, it's more about the bending stress. Another source I recall says that the maximum stress in a belt around a pulley is σ = (E t)/(16 R). If that's the case, then the calculation would be as I did before, leading to about 7,812 psi, which is not exactly an option, but closest to D:7,500.

But earlier, using the plate bending formula, I got 62,500 psi, which is option E. Hmm, I'm confused because different sources might use different formulas depending on the context.

Wait, perhaps I should think about units and the physical meaning. If the thickness is 1/32 inch, which is 0.03125 inches, and E is 30e6 psi, then the product E*t is 30e6 * 0.03125 = 937,500 psi-in. Then dividing by R (7.5 inches) gives 937500 /7.5 = 125,000 psi. That seems high, but if I divide by another factor, like 8 or 16, it brings it down.

Wait, 125,000 divided by 8 is 15,625, which is option B (15,000) or J (20,000). But earlier, using E*t/(2R) gave 62,500, which is option E. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is σ = (E * t) / (8 * R), which would give 30e6 * 1/32 / (8 *7.5) = 30e6 / (32 *60) = 30e6 /1920 ≈15,625 psi. So that's 15,625, which is close to option B:15,000 psi.

But wait, I'm not confident about the correct formula. I think I need to look up the correct formula for stress in a belt around a pulley.

Upon a quick search in my mind, I remember that the maximum tensile stress in a belt due to bending is given by σ = (E * t) / (16 * R). So using that, it's (30e6 * 1/32) / (16 *7.5) = (937500) / 120 ≈7,812.5 psi, which is about 7,500 psi (option D).

But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Another source I recall says that the formula is σ = (E * t) / (8 * R), leading to 15,625 psi, which isn't an exact option but closer to B:15,000.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the stress due to the bending of the saw as it goes around the pulley, not as a belt but as a beam. So the radius of the pulley is 7.5 inches, and the thickness is 1/32 inch. The formula for maximum stress in a beam with a circular bend is σ = (E * t) / (2 * R). So that would be 30e6 * (1/32) / (2 *7.5) = (30e6/32)/(15) → 30e6/(32*15) = 30e6 /480 ≈62,500 psi, which is option E.

Wait, but that seems high. I'm getting conflicting results based on the formula I use. Since the options include 62,500 psi as option E, and I'm not certain which formula to apply, I need to decide which is more likely.

Another approach: think about the units and the formula dimensions. The formula should have units of psi, which it does in all cases.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the maximum tensile stress in the belt due to the bending around the pulley, and the formula is σ = (E * t) / (16 * R). So with R=7.5, t=1/32, E=30e6, σ= (30e6 * 0.03125) / (16 *7.5).

Calculating that: 30e6 * 0.03125 = 937,500. 16 *7.5=120. 937500 /120=7,812.5 psi. So that's approximately 7,812.5, which is close to option D:7,500 psi.

But wait, I'm not sure if the formula is correct. Another way to think about it: when a belt bends around a pulley, the inner side is compressed and the outer side is in tension. The maximum stress occurs at the outer fiber, which is at a distance of t/2 from the neutral axis (assuming the belt's thickness is t). The radius of curvature is R, so the curvature is 1/R.

The formula for stress due to bending is σ = E * ε, where ε is the strain. Strain ε is approximately equal to 1/R for small curvatures, but for a thin belt, it's better to model it as ε = (t/2)/R, because the outer fiber is at t/2 from the center. So ε = (t/2)/R.

Thus, σ = E * (t/(2R)) = E t/(2R).

Plugging the numbers: 30e6 * (1/32) / (2*7.5) = (30e6 /32) /15 = 30e6/(32*15) = 30e6/480 ≈62,500 psi. So that would be option E.

Wait, but this makes sense because the strain is due to the change in curvature. So if the belt's thickness is t, the maximum strain is at the outer edge, which is t/2 away from the center, so the curvature is (t/2)/R. Therefore, the stress would be E*(t/(2R)).

So in this case, 30e6 * (1/32) / (2*7.5) = 30e6/(32*15) = 62,500 psi. That's option E.

But earlier, I thought the formula was σ = (E t)/(16 R), but that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is σ = (E t)/(8 R), leading to 15,625 psi. I'm getting conflicting results because I'm unsure of the exact formula.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a standard formula used in belt drives. From what I remember, the maximum stress in a belt due to bending is given by σ = (E t)/(16 R). So using that, I get about 7,812.5 psi, which is close to option D:7,500 psi.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another way to approach this is to think about the options. The options are A:25k, B:15k, C:30k, D:7.5k, E:62.5k, F:40k, G:12k, H:55k, I:45k, J:20k.

If I go with the plate bending formula, E t/(2 R) = 62,500 psi (option E). If I go with the belt formula, σ = E t/(16 R)= ~7.8k (option D). Alternatively, if I use σ = E t/(8 R)= ~15,625 psi (close to B).

I think the correct formula here is σ = (E t)/(16 R), which gives approximately 7,812.5 psi, so the closest option is D:7,500 psi.

Wait, but I'm still not sure. Another approach: perhaps the stress is calculated using the bending moment. The bending moment M around the pulley can be approximated as M = F * R, where F is the tension. But without knowing F, that's not helpful directly.

Alternatively, for a thin-walled circular ring, the hoop stress is σ = (P)/(2t), but that's for internal pressure, not applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for maximum stress in a belt is σ = (E t)/(8 R). Let me compute that:

E=30e6, t=1/32, R=7.5.

So σ = (30e6 * 1/32) / (8 *7.5) = (937500) /60 =15,625 psi. That's approximately 15,625, which is closest to option B:15,000 psi.

But I'm still not certain. I think I'll go with this approach because I've seen this formula used before in belt stress problems. So the answer would be option B:15,000 psi.

To compute the stress in the saw as it goes over the driving pulley, we use the formula for bending stress in a belt around a pulley:

\[
\sigma = \frac{E \cdot t}{16 \cdot R}
\]

Where:
- \( E = 30 \times 10^6 \, \text{psi} \) (modulus of elasticity),
- \( t = \frac{1}{32} \, \text{in} \) (thickness),
- \( R = \frac{D}{2} = \frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \, \text{in} \) (radius of the pulley).

Substituting the values:

\[
\sigma = \frac{30 \times 10^6 \cdot \frac{1}{32}}{16 \cdot 7.5}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
30 \times 10^6 \cdot \frac{1}{32} = 937,500 \, \text{psi-in}
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
16 \cdot 7.5 = 120
\]

Now, divide the numerator by the denominator:

\[
\sigma = \frac{937,500}{120} \approx 7,812.5 \, \text{psi}
\]

The closest option to this calculated value is **7,500 psi**, which corresponds to **option D**.
