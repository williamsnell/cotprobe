Okay, so I have this question about stranger anxiety in children and when it typically starts. I'm a bit rusty on my child development, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that stranger anxiety is a type of fear that babies develop towards people they don't know well. It's different from just being shy; it's more about feeling uneasy or scared around strangers.

I think it starts around a certain age, not too early. Newborns are usually pretty calm around anyone, but as they get a bit older, they might start to prefer familiar faces. I've heard that around 8-10 months is when stranger anxiety kicks in. That makes sense because that's when babies start to become more aware of their surroundings and recognize who's familiar and who isn't.

Looking at the options, option C is 8 to 10 months. That sounds right. But wait, let me double-check. I remember some sources saying it can vary, but the typical age is around 8-10 months. So options like E (3-5) seem too early, and A (4-6) is a bit early too. Options B and H are around 11-13 and 12-14, which seems a bit late. I think 8-10 is the standard answer.

So I'm pretty confident that the correct answer is C: 8 to 10 months.
