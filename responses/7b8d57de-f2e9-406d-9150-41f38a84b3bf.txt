Okay, so I've got this question about biochemistry terms, and I need to figure out the answer. The question is asking about the synthesis of glucose from lactate, glycerol, or amino acids. Hmm, I remember that there are several processes in metabolism related to glucose, so I need to think about each term.

Let's break it down. The question says "synthesis of glucose," which means it's about making glucose. The sources are lactate, glycerol, or amino acids. I think these are substrates that can be converted into glucose. So the process would be one that builds up glucose molecules.

Looking at the options, I need to recall what each term means. Option A is lipogenesis, which I think is the synthesis of lipids, like making fatty acids and triglycerides. So that's probably not it.

Option B is lipolysis, which I remember is the breakdown of fats or lipids. So that's the opposite of what we're looking for here.

Option C is lipo-genesis. Wait, that's the same as lipogenesis, right? So same as A, which is about fat synthesis, not glucose.

Option D is gluconeogenesis. The "neo" in neo genesis means new, so this is the process of making new glucose. I've heard that gluconeogenesis uses non-carbohydrate sources like lactate, glycerol, and amino acids to produce glucose. That sounds exactly like what the question is asking about.

Option E is proteolysis, which is the breakdown of proteins. So that's not the synthesis we're looking for.

Option F is glycosylation, which involves adding carbohydrate groups to proteins or other molecules. That's more about modifying other molecules, not making glucose.

Option G is glucogenesis. Wait, isn't that the same as gluconeogenesis? Or maybe it's an alternative term? I'm not sure, but I think gluconeogenesis is the correct term used in textbooks, so G might not be the standard answer.

Option H is glucagonolysis. Glucagon is a hormone that raises blood sugar, and its "lysis" would mean breakdown. So glucagonolysis would involve breaking down something related to glucagon, but I don't think that's relevant here.

Option I is glycogenolysis, which is the breakdown of glycogen into glucose. That's the opposite of synthesis, so not what we're looking for.

Option J is glycolysis, which is the breakdown of glucose into pyruvate. So that's the opposite process as well.

Putting it all together, the process that synthesizes glucose from lactate, glycerol, or amino acids is gluconeogenesis. So the correct answer should be D.

The synthesis of glucose from lactate, glycerol, or amino acids is called gluconeogenesis.

Answer: D
