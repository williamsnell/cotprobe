Question:

A homozygous tall pea plant was crossed with a homozygous dwarf pea plant. The gene for tall is dominant to its allele for dwarf. What will be the expected phenotypic and genotypic results in the F_1 and F_2 generations?

Options:

A: F_1 Generation: Genotypic results - (3/4) DD, (1/4) Dd, Phenotypic results - All tall. F_2 Generation: Genotypic results - (1/2) DD, (1/2) dd, Phenotypic results - (1/2) tall, (1/2) dwarf.
B: F_1 Generation: Genotypic results - All DD, Phenotypic results - All tall. F_2 Generation: Genotypic results - All DD, Phenotypic results - All tall.
C: F_1 Generation: Genotypic results - All Dd, Phenotypic results - All tall. F_2 Generation: Genotypic results - (1/4) DD, (1/2) Dd, (1/4) dd, Phenotypic results - (3/4) tall, (1/4) dwarf.
D: F_1 Generation: Genotypic results - All dd, Phenotypic results - All dwarf. F_2 Generation: Genotypic results - All dd, Phenotypic results - All dwarf.
E: F_1 Generation: Genotypic results - All DD, Phenotypic results - All tall. F_2 Generation: Genotypic results - (1/4) DD, (1/2) Dd, (1/4) dd, Phenotypic results - (3/4) tall, (1/4) dwarf.

Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the setup is crossing a homozygous tall pea plant with a homozygous dwarf pea plant. The tall gene is dominant over the dwarf allele. So I remember that in pea plants, the tall trait is usually controlled by a single gene, where 'D' represents the dominant allele for tall, and 'd' is recessive for dwarf. Homozygous means both alleles are the same, so the tall plant would be DD and the dwarf would be dd.

When you cross two homozygous parents, like DD (tall) and dd (dwarf), the F1 generation would all be hybrids. Since the tall is dominant, all F1 plants should be tall. But what's their genotype? Each parent contributes one allele. The DD parent can only give D, and the dd parent can only give d. So each F1 plant gets D from one parent and d from the other. That makes them all Dd. So F1 is all Dd, and since D is dominant, all are tall.

Now, what about F2? To get F2, you have to self-pollinate the F1 plants or cross them among themselves. So F1 plants are Dd. When Dd is crossed with Dd, each gamete can be D or d. So the possible combinations for the offspring are DD, Dd, Dd, and dd. That's a 25% chance for each: 25% DD, 50% Dd, and 25% dd.

Phenotypically, since D is dominant, any plant with at least one D will be tall. So DD and Dd are tall, and only dd is dwarf. So in F2, 75% (3/4) will be tall, and 25% (1/4) will be dwarf.

Looking at the options, let's check each one.

Option C says F1 is all Dd and all tall. F2 genotypic is 1/4 DD, 1/2 Dd, 1/4 dd. Phenotypic is 3/4 tall, 1/4 dwarf. That matches what I just thought.

Option E says F1 is all DD and all tall. Wait, no, because F1 plants are the result of crossing a DD with a dd. So each F1 would be Dd, not DD. So E is wrong.

Option H says F1 is all Dd, F2 genotypic is 1/2 DD, 1/4 Dd, 1/4 dd. So that's not right because the ratio for F2 should be 25% DD, 50% Dd, 25% dd. So H is incorrect.

Option I says F2 phenotypic is all tall. No, because some are dd, which are dwarf. So I's wrong.

So the correct answer should be option C.

The cross involves a homozygous tall (DD) and a homozygous dwarf (dd) pea plant. The F1 generation results from crossing these parents, producing offspring with genotype Dd (all heterozygous) and phenotype tall (since D is dominant). For the F2 generation, F1 plants (Dd) are crossed, leading to a 1:2:1 genotypic ratio (DD:Dd:dd) and a 3:1 phenotypic ratio (tall:dwarf).
