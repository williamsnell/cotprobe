And thereupon in kingdom after kingdom, place after place, many divine services were performed in magnificence, and many Warham fires were established, and many magi became happy and prosperous, and many fires and magi were imperially installed…
And then Hormizd, King of Kings, passed away. Then Bahram, King of Kings, son of Shapur, King of Kings, and brother of Hormizd, King of Kings, rose over the empire. And Bahram, King of Kings, also held me in high honor and dignity and at court and in kingdom after kingdom, place after place, gave me authority and power for divine services of every sort.

And in kingdom after kingdom and place after place throughout the whole empire the services of Ahura Mazda and the gods became preeminent, and great dignity came to the Mazdayanian religion and the magi in the empire, and the gods and water and fire and small cattle in the empire attained great satisfaction, while Ahriman [the evil counterpart to Ahura Mazda] and the demons were punished and rebuked, and the teachings of Ahriman and the demons departed from the empire and were abandoned. And Jews, Buddhists, Hindus, Nasoreans [Orthodox Christians], Christians, Maktak [Baptists], and Manichaeans in the empire were smitten, and destruction of idols and scattering of the stores of the demons and god-seats and nests was abandoned."

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about why there were Buddhist communities in Sassanid Persia. The question refers to an excerpt from Kerdir's inscription, which talks about the Sassanid kings promoting their own religion, Zoroastrianism, and mentions the suppression of other groups like Jews, Buddhists, Hindus, Christians, etc. 

First, I need to understand the context. The Sassanid Empire was a major power in the region, and they were very invested in their state religion, Zoroastrianism. The inscription mentions that under Hormizd and Bahram, the magi (Zoroastrian priests) were given a lot of power, and they worked to establish their divine services and fire temples. It also says that other religions were "smitten," meaning they were targeted or suppressed.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Persian efforts to convert people away from Buddhism inspired further followers. Hmm, that seems contradictory. If the Persians were trying to convert people away from Buddhism, why would there still be Buddhist communities? It seems more likely that if they were actively converting people, Buddhism might decline rather than grow. So maybe A isn't the best explanation.

Option B: Buddhism's apocalyptic message swayed converts in Persia. The apocalyptic aspect might relate to the end times or judgment, but I don't recall Buddhism being particularly apocalyptic. Zoroastrianism, on the other hand, has a clear dualistic end-time scenario with the coming of the Saoshyant. So maybe this isn't the main reason for Buddhist presence.

Option C: Persia's location sat astride international trade routes with India. This makes sense because the Silk Road and other trade routes connected Persia (which controlled parts of what's now Afghanistan and Central Asia) with India. Buddhism was widespread in India during the Sassanid period, especially in the northwestern regions like Gandhara. So trade and cultural exchange along these routes could have brought Buddhism into Persia. That seems plausible.

Option D: Buddhists were granted limited toleration by Zoroastrians. The inscription actually mentions that other religions were smitten and their idols destroyed, so it doesn't sound like they were granted much toleration. Instead, it seems like the opposite—other religions were suppressed. So D might not be correct.

Putting it together, the presence of Buddhist communities in Sassanid Persia is best explained by their location on trade routes connecting to India, which facilitated the spread of Buddhism. So the answer should be C.
