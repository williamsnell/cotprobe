Answer:

Okay, so I've got this problem about Jacob giving a note to the Franklin Mint, and I need to figure out the proceeds when it's discounted at the bank. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the note is for $1250, and it's a 90-day note. Jacob gives this note on October 10, and then he discounts it at the bank on November 15. The discount rate is 6 and a half percent, which is 6.5%. I need to find out how much money Jacob gets when he discounts the note.

I remember that when a note is discounted, the bank calculates the interest on the note and subtracts it from the face value. So the proceeds Jacob receives are the face value minus the discount.

To calculate the discount, I think I need to find the interest for the period from October 10 to November 15. Wait, let me make sure I get the dates right. The note is given on October 10, and it's a 90-day note, but it's being discounted on November 15. So the time between October 10 and November 15 is how many days?

Let me count the days. October has 31 days, so from October 10 to October 31 is 22 days (including the 10th? Wait, no—if you count from the 10th to the 31st, that's 22 days because 31-10=21, but I think you add 1 because both start and end are included. Wait, no, because from 10th to 11th is 1 day, so 31-10=21 days, but including both 10th and 31st, it's 22 days. Wait, maybe it's 22 days in October. Then November 1 to November 15 is 15 days. So total days would be 22 + 15 = 37 days.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me check again. October has 31 days. So from October 10 to October 31 is 22 days (since 31-10=21, but including both days, it's 22). Then November 1 to November 15 is 15 days. So total days from October 10 to November 15 is 22 + 15 = 37 days.

So the note is being discounted after 37 days, not the full 90 days. So I need to calculate the interest for 37 days, not 90.

Wait, but the problem says the note is a 90-day note, but it's being discounted on November 15. So the period we're considering is from October 10 to November 15, which is 37 days.

So the formula for the discount is:

Discount = Principal × Rate × Time

Where:
- Principal (P) = $1250
- Rate (R) = 6.5% per annum, which is 0.065 in decimal
- Time (T) = 37 days. Since the rate is annual, I need to convert days to years. There are 360 days in a year for banking calculations, I think. So T = 37/360.

So Discount = 1250 × 0.065 × (37/360)

Let me calculate that step by step.

First, calculate 0.065 × (37/360). Let me compute 37 divided by 360 first.

37 ÷ 360 ≈ 0.1027778

Then multiply by 0.065: 0.065 × 0.1027778 ≈ 0.00668055

Now, multiply that by 1250: 1250 × 0.00668055 ≈ ?

Let me compute that:

0.00668055 × 1000 = 6.68055
0.00668055 × 250 = 1.6701375
Adding together: 6.68055 + 1.6701375 = 8.3506875

So the discount is approximately $8.3506875.

Now, the proceeds would be the face value minus the discount: 1250 - 8.3506875 ≈ 1241.6493125

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see $1241.65. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the days?

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the number of days between October 10 and November 15.

Let me recount the days more carefully.

October 10 to October 31: Let's count each day. From October 10 (inclusive) to October 31 (inclusive). So 31 - 10 = 21, but since we include both the start and end, it's 22 days.

Then November 1 to November 15: That's 15 days.

So total days = 22 + 15 = 37 days. That seems correct.

Wait, but sometimes banks count the days differently. Maybe they don't include the start date? Let me check again. If I'm counting from October 10 to October 11 as 1 day, then October 10 is day 0, October 11 is day 1, etc. So from October 10 to October 31 is 22 days (including October 10 as day 0, so 22 days would be October 10 to October 31 inclusive? Wait, perhaps I should use a different approach.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for days between two dates. October has 31 days.

From October 10 to October 31: 31 - 10 = 21 days, but since we include both the start and end dates, it's 22 days.

Then November 1 to November 15: 15 days.

Total: 22 + 15 = 37 days. So that's correct.

So the calculation seems right, but the result I got isn't matching the options. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: $1,200

B: $1,215.75

C: $1,230.50

D: $1,235.00

E: $1,242.50

F: $1,250

G: $1,237.81

H: $1,222.22

I: $1,210

J: $1,225.00

Hmm, my calculation gave me approximately $1241.65, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately without rounding too early.

Let me recalculate the discount:

First, 37 days at 6.5% per annum.

So Time T = 37/360 = 0.1027778...

Rate R = 6.5% = 0.065

So the discount factor is R × T = 0.065 × (37/360) = (0.065 × 37) / 360

Calculating 0.065 × 37:

0.065 × 30 = 1.95

0.065 ×7=0.455

Total: 1.95 + 0.455 = 2.405

So 2.405 / 360 = ?

2.405 ÷ 360 = 0.006680555...

So the discount is 1250 × 0.006680555 = ?

1250 × 0.006680555

Let me compute this:

1250 × 0.006 = 7.5

1250 × 0.000680555 ≈ 1250 × 0.000680555 ≈ 0.85069375

So total discount ≈ 7.5 + 0.85069375 ≈ 8.35069375

So discount is approximately $8.3507

Proceeds: 1250 - 8.3507 ≈ 1241.6493

But again, this isn't one of the options. So I must have made a mistake in the days calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps the period is 37 days, but maybe the bank uses 360 days or 365? Wait, in banking calculations, it's typically 360 days per year. So that part is correct.

Wait, maybe the discount is calculated using simple interest, but perhaps I should use the exact number of days or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the discount as (6.5% per annum) × (number of days) / 360.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula:

Discount = Principal × (Rate × Time)

Where Time is in years.

So yes, that's what I did. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting the days.

Wait, let me count the days again, perhaps I'm off by one.

From October 10 to October 11: 1 day

October 10 to October 31: 22 days (including both 10th and 31st)

Then November 1 to November 15: 15 days.

Total days: 22 + 15 = 37. Hmm, that seems right.

Wait, perhaps the discount period is only 36 days? Let's see: maybe the counting is different.

Wait, from October 10 to November 15 inclusive? Let me count each month.

October has 31 days. So from October 10 to October 31, that's 22 days.

Then November 1 to November 15 is 15 days.

Total 37 days.

Alternatively, maybe the bank doesn't count the start date, so from October 11 to November 15, which would be 36 days.

Wait, let me see: If the note is given on October 10, and the discount is on November 15, so the period is from October 10 to November 15, inclusive? Or is it from October 11 to November 15, which would be 36 days?

Because sometimes the start date is not counted. Wait, I'm confused.

Let me use another method: calculate the number of days between October 10 and November 15.

October has 31 days, so from October 10 to October 31 is 22 days (including both days).

Then November 1 to November 15 is 15 days.

Total: 22 + 15 = 37 days.

But perhaps the correct way is to calculate the days from October 10 to November 15 as 37 days. So my initial calculation stands.

But since my result isn't matching any of the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me try another approach. Maybe the discount is calculated using the formula:

Discount = (P × R × T) / 100

Where R is 6.5, T is 37/360.

So Discount = (1250 × 6.5 × 37) / (100 × 360)

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute 1250 × 6.5 = ?

1250 × 6 = 7500

1250 × 0.5 = 625

Total: 7500 + 625 = 8125

Now, 8125 × 37 = ?

Let me compute 8125 × 30 = 243,750

8125 ×7=56,875

Total: 243,750 +56,875= 300,625

Now, divide by (100 × 360) = 36,000

So Discount = 300,625 / 36,000 ≈ 8.35069444...

So again, discount is approximately $8.3507

Proceeds: 1250 - 8.3507 ≈ 1241.6493, which is about $1,241.65

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the days calculation. Maybe the period is 36 days instead of 37.

Let me check the days again.

If October 10 to November 15 is 36 days, then:

Time T = 36/360 = 0.1

So Discount = 1250 × 0.065 × 0.1 = 1250 × 0.0065 = 8.125

Proceeds: 1250 - 8.125 = 1241.875, which is about $1,241.88, still not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should check the options to see which one is close to my calculation.

Wait, the closest option to $1,241.65 is option E: $1,242.50. But that's a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the rate.

Wait, 6.5% is correct, right? The problem says 6(1/2)%, which is 6.5%.

Alternatively, maybe the time is 37 days over 365 days, not 360. Let's try that.

So T = 37/365 ≈ 0.10137931

Then Discount = 1250 × 0.065 × 0.10137931

Compute 0.065 × 0.10137931 ≈ 0.006590655

Then 1250 × 0.006590655 ≈ 8.238319

So discount ≈ $8.2383

Proceeds: 1250 - 8.2383 ≈ $1,241.76

Still not matching any options. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should check if the period is 36 days instead of 37. Let's recalculate with T=36/360=0.1

Discount = 1250 × 0.065 × 0.1 = 1250 × 0.0065 = 8.125

Proceeds: 1250 - 8.125 = 1241.875

Still no match. Alternatively, perhaps the rate is 6% instead of 6.5%, but the problem says 6(1/2)%, so that's 6.5%.

Wait, maybe I should check the options again. Let me see option G: $1,237.81. Let's see what discount that would imply.

If proceeds are $1,237.81, then discount is 1250 - 1237.81 = $12.19

So discount is $12.19

So 12.19 = 1250 × 0.065 × T

So T = 12.19 / (1250 × 0.065) = 12.19 / 81.25 ≈ 0.15 years, which is 54 days. But we're only considering 37 days, so that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, option E is $1,242.50. So discount is 1250 - 1242.50 = $7.50

So 7.50 = 1250 × 0.065 × T

T = 7.50 / (1250 × 0.065) = 7.50 / 81.25 ≈ 0.0923 years, which is about 33.86 days. But our period is 37 days, so that's not matching either.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation. Let me try to compute the discount again using exact steps.

Compute 37 days at 6.5%:

First, 6.5% per annum is 0.065.

Time in years: 37/360 = 0.102777...

So discount = 1250 × 0.065 × (37/360)

Let me compute 0.065 × 37 = 2.405

Then, 2.405 / 360 = 0.006680555...

Multiply by 1250: 1250 × 0.006680555 ≈ 8.3507

So discount is $8.3507

Proceeds: 1250 - 8.3507 ≈ 1241.65

Hmm, but the options don't have this. Wait, did I perhaps miscalculate the days?

Wait, perhaps the period is from October 10 to November 15, which is 37 days, but if the bank calculates using 360 days, then 37/360 is correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the note is a 90-day note, but it's being discounted after 37 days, so the remaining term is 53 days. But I don't think that affects the discount calculation because the discount is based on the time from the present (November 15) to the maturity date (October 10 + 90 days). Wait, no, the discount is calculated on the face value at the current date, so it's only for the period until discounting, not the remaining period.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the maturity date first. The note is given on October 10 for 90 days. So adding 90 days to October 10.

Let me calculate the maturity date:

October has 31 days, so from October 10, 90 days later:

October: 31 - 10 = 21 days remaining in October, so 21 days from October 10 brings us to October 31. That's 21 days.

90 - 21 = 69 days remaining.

November has 30 days: 30 days in November, so 69 -30=39 days left.

December has 31 days: 39 -31=8 days into January.

So the maturity date is January 8th.

Wait, but the discount is being done on November 15, which is before the maturity date. So the time from November 15 to January 8 is the remaining term, but the discount is calculated from the present (November 15) to the maturity date (January 8), which is 54 days.

Wait, but no, the discount is calculated on the present date (November 15) for the time until the maturity date, which is 54 days.

Wait, but that's not right. The discount is calculated from the date of discounting (November 15) to the maturity date (January 8), which is 54 days. So perhaps I should calculate the discount based on 54 days instead of 37 days.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the discount is the interest accrued from the present (November 15) to the maturity date. So if Jacob discounts the note on November 15, the bank will calculate the interest from November 15 to January 8, which is 54 days, and subtract that from the face value.

Wait, that would make more sense. Because the discount is the interest that would have been earned from the discount date to maturity. So the time period is 54 days, not 37 days.

Wait, that's a different approach. Let me clarify: when you discount a note, the bank calculates the interest from the current date (discount date) to the maturity date. So the time is from November 15 to January 8, which is 54 days.

So I think I made a mistake earlier by considering the time from October 10 to November 15, but it should be from November 15 to January 8.

So, let me recalculate.

First, find the maturity date: October 10 + 90 days = January 8.

Then, the time from November 15 to January 8.

November has 30 days, so from November 15 to November 30 is 16 days (including the 15th? Wait, November 15 to November 30 is 16 days because 30-15=15, but including both 15 and 30, it's 16 days.

Then December has 31 days, but from December 1 to December 31 is 31 days.

Then from January 1 to January 8 is 8 days.

So total days: 16 (Nov) + 31 (Dec) + 8 (Jan) = 55 days.

Wait, but let me recount:

From November 15 to November 30: 16 days (including both 15th and 30th).

Then December: 31 days.

Then January 1 to January 8: 8 days.

Total: 16 +31 +8=55 days.

So time T = 55/360 ≈ 0.152777...

Now, discount = 1250 × 0.065 × (55/360)

Compute:

First, 0.065 × 55 = 3.575

Then 3.575 / 360 ≈ 0.009930555...

Then, 1250 × 0.009930555 ≈ 12.4132

So discount ≈ $12.4132

Proceeds = 1250 - 12.4132 ≈ $1,237.5868

Looking at the options, the closest is option D: $1,235.00, but that's still a bit off. Alternatively, let's see if I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Compute 0.065 × 55 = 3.575

3.575 / 360 = 0.009930555...

1250 × 0.009930555 = ?

Let me compute 1250 × 0.009930555

1250 × 0.01 = 12.5

But since it's 0.009930555, which is 0.01 - 0.000069445.

So 12.5 - (1250 × 0.000069445)

1250 × 0.000069445 ≈ 0.08680625

So 12.5 - 0.08680625 ≈ 12.41319375

So discount is approximately $12.4132

Proceeds: 1250 - 12.4132 ≈ 1237.5868

Looking at the options, the closest is option G: $1,237.81. But wait, my calculation is $1,237.5868, which is approximately $1,237.59. Option G is $1,237.81, which is slightly higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the day count. Let me recount the days from November 15 to January 8.

November 15 to November 30: 16 days (including 15th and 30th).

December: 31 days.

January 1 to 8: 8 days.

Total: 16 +31 +8=55 days.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the bank uses 360 days, so 55/360 is correct.

Wait, maybe I should compute the discount again more accurately.

1250 × 0.065 × (55/360) = 1250 × (0.065 × 55) / 360

0.065 ×55 = 3.575

3.575 /360 = 0.009930555...

1250 × 0.009930555 = ?

Let me compute 1250 × 0.009930555:

1250 × 0.009 = 11.25

1250 × 0.000930555 ≈ 1250 × 0.0009 = 1.125, and 1250 ×0.000030555≈0.03819375

So total ≈11.25 +1.125 +0.03819375 ≈12.41319375

So discount is $12.41319375

Proceeds: 1250 -12.41319375 ≈1237.5868

So approximately $1,237.59

Looking at the options, option G is $1,237.81, which is very close. Perhaps due to rounding differences in intermediate steps.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute without breaking it down.

Let me compute it as:

1250 × (6.5/100) × (55/360)

=1250 × (0.065) × (55/360)

=1250 × (0.065 × 55) /360

=1250 × (3.575)/360

=1250 × 0.0099305555...

=12.41319375

So, proceeds =1250 -12.41319375=1237.5868...

Which is approximately $1,237.59

The option closest to this is G: $1,237.81

But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the days. Let me check the days again.

Wait, from November 15 to November 30 is 16 days, right? Because from the 15th to the 30th inclusive is 16 days (30-15+1=16).

Then December has 31 days.

January 1 to 8 is 8 days.

So total is 16 +31 +8=55 days.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but let's compute the discount again with exact fractions.

55 days is 55/360 years.

So:

Discount = 1250 × 0.065 × (55/360)

=1250 × (0.065 ×55) /360

=1250 × (3.575)/360

=1250 × (3.575 ÷360)

Compute 3.575 ÷360:

3.575 ÷360 = 0.009930555...

Now, 1250 ×0.009930555=12.41319375

So, discount is $12.41319375

Proceeds:1250 -12.41319375=1237.5868...

Which is $1,237.59

Looking at the options, the closest is G: $1,237.81, but there's a discrepancy of about 22 cents. Alternatively, perhaps the bank rounds to the nearest cent, so maybe it's $1,237.59, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier, and the correct answer is option D: $1,235.00, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the discount based on the time from the discount date to maturity, which is 55 days, so let's compute it again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for simple interest:

Interest = P × R × T

Where T is in years.

So, T = 55/360 = 0.152777...

Interest = 1250 × 0.065 × (55/360)

Which is the same as before, leading to the same result.

Wait, perhaps the options have a typo, or I made a mistake in the day count. Alternatively, perhaps the period is 54 days instead of 55.

Let me check the days from November 15 to January 8.

From November 15 to November 30: 16 days.

December:31

January:8

Total:16+31+8=55 days.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the bank doesn't count the maturity date as a full day, so 54 days instead. Let me try that.

If T=54/360=0.15

Then discount=1250 ×0.065 ×0.15=1250 ×0.00975=12.1875

Proceeds=1250-12.1875=1237.8125, which is $1,237.81. That's exactly option G.

Ah, so perhaps the bank doesn't count the maturity date as a full day, so it's 54 days instead of 55.

So, the correct calculation would be 54 days, leading to proceeds of $1,237.81, which is option G.

Therefore, the answer is G.
</think>

Jacob gave a 90-day note for $1250 on October 10. The note was discounted on November 15 at 6.5%. To find the proceeds, we calculate the discount based on the time from November 15 to the maturity date, which is January 8. This period is 54 days. Using the simple interest formula:

Discount = Principal × Rate × Time  
= $1250 × 0.065 × (54/360)  
= $1250 × 0.065 × 0.15  
= $12.1875  

Proceeds = $1250 - $12.1875 = $1,237.81  

The closest option is **G: $1,237.81**.

G
