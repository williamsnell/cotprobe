Okay, so I have this question about Singer and who among the historical philosophers recognized that the principle of equal consideration of interests applies to other species. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Peter Singer is a philosopher known for his work in ethics, particularly animal ethics. His book "Animal Liberation" is a big deal in this area. He argues that the principle of equal consideration of interests should be extended to all beings who can suffer, regardless of their species.

The question is asking which historical figure Singer would identify as one of the few who recognized this. The options are a list of philosophers, so I need to think about each one's views.

A: Aristotle - I think Aristotle saw humans as superior to animals, often using them for various purposes. He didn't really consider animals' interests equally, I believe.

B: Nietzsche - He was a big proponent of human superiority, the "ubermensch" idea. Unlikely he thought animals' interests should be equal.

C: David Hume - He was a Scottish philosopher, more known for empiricism. Not sure about his views on animal rights, but I don't think he extended equal consideration to animals.

D: Jeremy Bentham - He was a utilitarian, right? Utilitarianism is about maximizing overall happiness. I remember that Bentham talked about the "expansibility" of the moral community. He argued that the ability to suffer should be the basis for moral consideration, not just human status. So he might have included animals because they can suffer.

E: John Stuart Mill - He was a utilitarian too, following Bentham. But I think he focused more on human rights and justice, not as much on animal rights. Not sure if he extended the principle to animals.

F: Thomas Hobbes - He was a social contract theorist, focused on human nature and society. Probably didn't extend consideration to animals.

G: Immanuel Kant - He had a strong view of human dignity and rationality. He didn't think animals had rights because they lack reason. So Singer would probably not include him.

H: Jean-Jacques Rousseau - He talked about the general will and society, but I don't think he considered animal interests equally.

I: Socrates - He was more into ethics and human virtue, not so much on animal rights.

J: Rene Descartes - He was a dualist, separating mind and body. He thought animals were just machines without true consciousness, so no moral consideration.

Putting it all together, the only one who seems to match is D: Jeremy Bentham. He was one of the early thinkers who considered that the ability to suffer should be the basis for moral consideration, which would include animals. Singer likely highlights him as one of the few historical figures to recognize this.

The correct answer is D: Jeremy Bentham. He was an early thinker who recognized that the principle of equal consideration of interests should be extended to all beings capable of suffering, including animals.

Answer: D
