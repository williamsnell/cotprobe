Question:

Four people own a property, and they agree to convey to an adult child of one of them. There is a purchasemoney mortgage on the property for which the four signed a promissory note as security. The loan was not satisfied at the time of the conveyance. The conveyance is a deed in fee simple to the adult child. The adult child then takes over the mortgage payments. The adult child stops making the payments and conveys the property to a bona fide purchaser who does not do a title search. The purchaser sues his grantor to get an order compelling him to pay the mortgage and remove the lien from his property. Will the court more than likely grant the motion to dismiss made by the defendants?

Options:

A: Yes, that is the risk the purchaser took; he cannot go to closing without a title search and a title company making arrangements for payment of the outstanding mortgage by the seller at closing.
B: Yes, but the court will also issue an order for the original four owners to pay a portion of the outstanding mortgage.
C: No, the court will order the purchaser to resume payments on the mortgage and to obtain a loan to pay it off within a reasonable time.
D: No, the court will order the bona fide purchaser to pay the outstanding mortgage.
E: Yes, because the court can only force the original four owners to clear the mortgage by paying it in full.
F: Yes, the court will dismiss the case because the purchaser did not conduct a title search before buying the property.
G: No, the court will order the adult child to resume paying on the mortgage and to obtain a loan to pay it off within a reasonable time.
H: No, the court will order the original four owners to come into court and defend on behalf of the adult child, who has no legal responsibility for the mortgage.
I: No, the court will order the adult child and the original four owners to equally share the remaining mortgage payments.
J: Yes, because the court can only force the adult child to clear the mortgage by paying it in full.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this real estate law question. Let me read it carefully and break it down step by step.

So, the situation is: there are four people who own a property. They agree to convey it to an adult child of one of them. There's a purchase-money mortgage on the property, which means the mortgage was taken out to help finance the purchase of the property. The four of them signed a promissory note as security for this loan. Importantly, the loan wasn't satisfied at the time of the conveyance, so the mortgage lien is still on the property.

The conveyance is a deed in fee simple, which means it's a complete transfer of ownership. The adult child takes over making the mortgage payments. But then, the adult child stops paying, and conveys the property to a bona fide purchaser (BFP), who doesn't do a title search. Now, the purchaser is suing the grantor (the adult child) to get an order compelling the grantor to pay the mortgage and remove the lien.

The question is whether the court will grant the motion to dismiss by the defendants. The options are A through J, each with different possibilities.

First, I need to understand what a motion to dismiss means. It's a procedural device that allows a defendant to argue that even if the plaintiff's allegations are true, the plaintiff isn't entitled to relief. So, the court would look at whether the plaintiff has stated a claim upon which relief can be granted. If the allegations don't state a valid claim, the court can dismiss the case.

Now, in this case, the purchaser is suing the grantor (the adult child) for the mortgage payments. Let's think about the chain of title and the mortgage.

When the four owners conveyed the property to the adult child, the mortgage was still in place. The adult child took over the payments, but then stopped. So, the mortgage was still outstanding when the adult child sold to the BFP.

A bona fide purchaser is someone who buys property without notice of any prior claims or defects in the title. They are protected under the law from prior liens or encumbrances if they purchase without notice and for value.

But wait, the BFP didn't do a title search. That's a key point. Usually, BFP status requires that the purchaser didn't have notice of any prior claims. However, in some jurisdictions, a purchaser who doesn't conduct a title search might not be considered a BFP because they didn't exercise due diligence. But I'm not sure about that—maybe it depends on the state laws.

The mortgage is a lien on the property. When the adult child conveyed it to the BFP, the mortgage lien would still be attached to the property. The BFP took over the property subject to that lien unless it was paid off or otherwise extinguished.

So, the BFP sues the grantor (adult child) to make them pay the mortgage and remove the lien. But the question is whether the court will dismiss the case.

If the BFP is a bona fide purchaser, they are protected from prior liens, but in this case, the lien is from a purchase-money mortgage that was in place when the property was conveyed to the adult child. Wait, no—the mortgage was taken out by the original four owners. When the adult child took over the payments, but then stopped, the lien was still there when they sold to the BFP.

In general, a mortgage lien runs with the land. So, even if the adult child stopped making payments, the lien remains. The BFP would be subject to that lien unless it's paid off. But since the BFP didn't do a title search, they might not have known about the lien. However, in some states, even if the BFP didn't search, they could still be considered a BFP because they didn't have actual or constructive notice of the lien.

But wait, the mortgage was given by the original four owners. When the adult child took over the payments, they became responsible for the mortgage. But when the adult child conveyed the property, the mortgage lien would still be on the property. So, the BFP took the property subject to that lien unless the lien was extinguished.

In mortgage law, if the borrower (here, the adult child) stops making payments, the mortgagee (the lender) can foreclose on the property. The BFP, as a subsequent purchaser, would be subject to that lien unless they pay it off or unless they have some defense.

But the BFP is suing the grantor (adult child) to make them pay the mortgage. The question is whether the court will dismiss the case.

I think the key here is whether the adult child is liable to the BFP for the mortgage. The BFP is suing the grantor for the mortgage payments. But in reality, the mortgage is between the original four owners and the lender. The adult child took over the payments, but when they conveyed the property, the mortgage lien remains.

If the BFP is a bona fide purchaser, they might have a claim against the grantor for breach of warranty, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the BFP could be liable for the mortgage because they took the property subject to the lien, unless the grantor is legally obligated to pay it off.

Wait, the BFP didn't do a title search. In some places, a BFP is someone who pays value without notice of a prior claim. If the BFP didn't search, they might not have constructive notice, so they could still be a BFP. Therefore, they might not be responsible for the mortgage. But the problem is that the mortgage was a lien, so the BFP would still be on the hook for it unless the grantor (adult child) pays it off.

But the BFP is suing the grantor, not the lender. The court would have to decide if the grantor is liable for the mortgage payments. Alternatively, maybe the BFP can't force the grantor to pay the mortgage because the grantor didn't take the property anymore; it's now the BFP's responsibility.

Wait, when the adult child conveyed the property to the BFP, the mortgage lien was still attached. The BFP is now the holder of the property but subject to the lien. The BFP is suing the grantor (adult child) to make them pay the mortgage. But legally, the mortgage is a debt owed by the original borrowers (the four owners) and the adult child, but when the adult child conveyed the property, the lien remains, and the BFP takes it subject to that lien.

So, the BFP is probably responsible for the mortgage payments, not the grantor. Therefore, the court might dismiss the case because the BFP can't compel the grantor to pay the mortgage. The grantor isn't obligated to pay it anymore because they no longer own the property.

Looking at the options:

A: Yes, that is the risk the purchaser took; he cannot go to closing without a title search and a title company making arrangements for payment of the outstanding mortgage by the seller at closing.

But the purchaser is a BFP who didn't do a title search. So, this might be correct, but I'm not sure.

F: Yes, the court will dismiss because the purchaser didn't do a title search. This seems similar to A.

But another angle: the original mortgage was given by the four owners. The adult child took over payments but stopped. The BFP then bought the property. The mortgage lien is still on the property, so the BFP is responsible for it. The BFP can't force the grantor (adult child) to pay it because the grantor doesn't have any interest in the property anymore. So, the court would dismiss the case because the BFP's claim against the grantor is without merit.

So, looking at the options, A and F suggest that the court will dismiss because the purchaser should have done a title search. But the BFP didn't search but is a bona fide purchaser. Alternatively, maybe the court will dismiss because the grantor isn't liable.

Wait, but if the BFP is a bona fide purchaser, they take the property free of prior liens except for those that would have been discovered with a title search. Since they didn't search, they might not be a BFP. So if the BFP didn't search, they might not qualify as a BFP, meaning they took the property with notice (constructive) of the lien. Therefore, they are not a BFP and are subject to the lien, making them liable for the mortgage.

But the question is about suing the grantor (adult child). If the BFP is not a BFP because they didn't search, they might have a claim against the grantor for breach of warranty. The grantor would then be liable for any defects in title. But the mortgage was a lien, so if the grantor conveyed the property with a mortgage lien, the BFP could sue the grantor for breach of warranty. In that case, the court might not dismiss the case.

Alternatively, if the BFP is a bona fide purchaser despite not searching, then the grantor isn't liable because the BFP took the risk without a search.

I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.

In some states, a BFP is someone who buys without notice of prior liens. If the BFP didn't search, they might not have constructive notice, so they could still be a BFP. If so, then the BFP is not liable to the prior mortgagee because they are a BFP. Wait, no—the mortgage is a lien against the property, so the BFP would have to pay it off or face foreclosure, regardless of their status as a BFP. But the BFP is suing the grantor, not the lender.

If the BFP is a BFP, they can sue the grantor for breach of warranty. The grantor would then be liable for the mortgage because they conveyed the property subject to the lien. So, the court would not dismiss the case because the BFP has a valid claim against the grantor.

But if the BFP didn't do a title search, in some jurisdictions, they might not be considered a BFP. Then, the grantor isn't liable because the BFP had constructive notice of the lien, and thus the grantor didn't breach the warranty.

Wait, but the BFP didn't do a title search. So, they might not have constructive notice. Therefore, they are a BFP, and the grantor is liable for the lien because they didn't pay it off before the conveyance.

Wait, no. The grantor took over the payments but then stopped, but the mortgage was still in place when they conveyed it. So, the grantor didn't pay it off, so the lien remains.

If the BFP is a BFP, they can sue the grantor for the breach of the warranty. The grantor would then be liable to pay off the mortgage.

But in the question, the BFP is suing the grantor to make them pay the mortgage and remove the lien. So, if the BFP is a BFP, the court would not dismiss the case because the grantor is liable.

But if the BFP is not a BFP because they didn't search, then the grantor isn't liable, and the court would dismiss.

I'm getting conflicting possibilities. Let me check the options again.

Option A says the court will dismiss because the purchaser took the risk without a title search. Option F says the court will dismiss because the purchaser didn't do a title search.

But if the BFP is a BFP despite not searching, then the court wouldn't dismiss. So, in that case, the correct answer would be that the court doesn't dismiss, i.e., the answer would be D, G, H, I, or J.

Wait, but the answer options are A through J. Let me read the options again.

Option A: Yes, purchaser took the risk without a title search.

Option F: Yes, same reasoning.

Option D: No, court will order purchaser to resume payments.

Option G: No, court will order adult child to resume.

Option H: No, court will order original four to defend.

Option J: Yes, because court can only force the adult child to pay.

Hmm. So, the key is whether the court will dismiss the case.

If the BFP is a BFP, then the grantor is liable for the lien, so the court won't dismiss. If not, the court will dismiss.

But the BFP didn't do a title search. In some jurisdictions, a BFP must at least perform a title search, so by not doing so, they aren't a BFP. Therefore, the court would dismiss because the BFP can't sue the grantor for breach of warranty as they had constructive notice.

Alternatively, maybe the BFP is a BFP because they didn't have actual notice, even without the search.

I think the correct answer is A or F. But the options are slightly different.

Option F says "Yes, the court will dismiss because the purchaser did not conduct a title search before buying the property."

Option A says "Yes, that is the risk the purchaser took; he cannot go to closing without a title search and a title company making arrangements for payment of the outstanding mortgage by the seller at closing."

So, A and F seem similar but A is more about the process at closing, while F is more direct.

In real estate transactions, typically, the title company would handle the payoff of the mortgage at closing if the seller is conveying the property subject to the mortgage. But in this case, the adult child took over the mortgage and stopped paying, so the mortgage wasn't satisfied.

If the BFP didn't do a title search, they might not know about the lien, but the court would say that it's their responsibility to have done so. Therefore, the court would dismiss the case, meaning the purchaser took the risk.

So, the answer is A or F.

Wait, but in some states, a BFP is someone who didn't have notice, whether through a search or not. So, if the BFP didn't search, they might not have constructive notice, making them a BFP. Therefore, the court wouldn't dismiss because the grantor is liable.

But the options don't have that. Let me think again.

The BFP is suing the grantor. If the grantor is liable, the court won't dismiss. If not, it will.

In this scenario, the original four owners and the adult child signed the promissory note. The mortgage is a lien on the property. When the adult child conveyed it to the BFP, the lien remains. The BFP is now the holder of the property subject to the lien.

The BFP can't force the grantor to pay the mortgage because the grantor isn't responsible for the mortgage anymore. The BFP would have to pay it themselves or face foreclosure.

Therefore, the court would dismiss the case because the grantor isn't liable for the mortgage payments after conveying the property. So, the BFP's claim against the grantor is without merit.

In that case, the correct answer is A or F. Since the BFP didn't do a title search, they took the risk, so the court would dismiss.

Looking back, the options:

A: Yes, because the purchaser took the risk without a title search.

F: Same reasoning but phrased differently.

Wait, but in A, it's more about the process at closing, implying that the seller should have arranged for the mortgage payoff. But in this case, the adult child took over the payments but stopped, so the mortgage wasn't paid off. The BFP didn't do a title search, so they can't force the seller to pay the mortgage.

Therefore, the court would dismiss the case because the purchaser assumed the risk by not doing a title search. So, the answer is A or F.

I think A is more accurate because it's not just about the search but also about the responsibility at closing. The purchaser should have known to have the title company handle the mortgage payoff, but since they didn't, they're stuck.

So, the answer is A.

The question revolves around whether a court will grant a motion to dismiss in a scenario involving a bona fide purchaser (BFP) who did not conduct a title search before buying property subject to an outstanding mortgage lien. The key points to consider are the BFP's status, the mortgage lien's enforceability, and the grantor's liability.

1. **BFP Status**: A BFP is someone who buys property without notice of prior claims. If the BFP did not conduct a title search, they might still qualify as a BFP in jurisdictions where constructive notice is not imputed for failing to search. However, in some jurisdictions, a BFP is expected to conduct a title search, and failing to do so could result in them not being considered a BFP.

2. **Mortgage Lien**: The mortgage lien remains on the property even after the grantor (adult child) conveys the property to the BFP. The BFP takes the property subject to this lien unless it is paid off or otherwise extinguished.

3. **Grantor's Liability**: The grantor (adult child) is no longer responsible for the mortgage payments after conveying the property. The BFP, as the new owner, is typically liable for the mortgage unless the grantor is legally obligated to pay it off, which is not the case here.

4. **Motion to Dismiss**: The court would likely dismiss the case because the BFP assumed the risk by not conducting a title search. A title search would have revealed the mortgage lien, and the BFP's failure to do so means they cannot compel the grantor to pay the mortgage.

Given these considerations, the court will dismiss the case because the BFP took the risk of not conducting a title search, which is a fundamental step in such transactions. The correct answer is:

**A: Yes, that is the risk the purchaser took; he cannot go to closing without a title search and a title company making arrangements for payment of the outstanding mortgage by the seller at closing.**
