Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on my equilibrium concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the problem is asking.

The reaction given is S(s) + 2CO(g) ⇌ SO₂(g) + 2C(s). We need to find the equilibrium constant K_p for this reaction. The problem states that at the given temperature, two atmospheres of CO are introduced into a vessel containing excess solid sulfur. The final equilibrium pressure observed is 1.03 atm.

Hmm, I remember that K_p is calculated using the partial pressures of the gases involved, raised to their stoichiometric coefficients, and the solids and liquids are ignored since their activities are constant. So in this reaction, the solids S and C won't be part of the K_p expression. Only the gaseous species, which is CO and SO₂, will be considered.

Let me write down the balanced equation again to keep track:

S(s) + 2CO(g) ⇌ SO₂(g) + 2C(s)

So the K_p expression should be (P_SO2) / (P_CO)^2. Because the stoichiometric coefficients are 1 for SO₂ and 2 for CO.

Now, let's think about the initial pressures and changes. The initial pressure of CO is 2 atm because that's what's introduced. The initial pressure of SO₂ is zero because it's not mentioned, so I assume it's not present initially. The solids (S and C) don't affect the pressure since their amounts are in excess and they don't contribute to gaseous pressure.

Let me set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) for the pressures.

Initial:
CO: 2 atm
SO₂: 0 atm

Change:
CO will decrease by 2x because it's on the reactant side. Wait, actually, no. Let me think again. The reaction is 2 moles of CO reacting to produce 1 mole of SO₂. So for every 2 moles of CO consumed, 1 mole of SO₂ is produced.

Wait, no, let me write it correctly. Let's say the change is: CO decreases by 2x, and SO₂ increases by x. Because the stoichiometry is 2 CO → 1 SO₂.

Wait, no, maybe I should use a variable 'x' for the change in CO. Let me think: when the reaction proceeds forward, CO is consumed, and SO₂ is formed. So if the change in CO is -2x (since 2 moles are consumed), then the change in SO₂ is +x (since 1 mole is produced). But wait, let me double-check. The balanced equation is 2CO → SO₂, so the mole ratio is 2:1. So for every 2 moles of CO consumed, 1 mole of SO₂ is formed. So if the change in CO is -2x, then the change in SO₂ is +x.

So, ICE table:

Initial:
CO: 2 atm
SO₂: 0 atm

Change:
CO: -2x
SO₂: +x

Equilibrium:
CO: 2 - 2x
SO₂: x

Wait, but the problem states that the final equilibrium pressure is 1.03 atm. Wait, that's the total pressure in the vessel. But how does that relate to the partial pressures of each gas?

Because in the vessel, the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of all gases present. But in this case, only CO and SO₂ are gases. So the total pressure P_total = P_CO + P_SO2.

At equilibrium, P_CO is (2 - 2x) and P_SO2 is x. So total pressure is (2 - 2x) + x = 2 - x.

But the problem says the final equilibrium pressure is 1.03 atm. So:

2 - x = 1.03

Solving for x:

x = 2 - 1.03 = 0.97 atm.

So the equilibrium partial pressure of SO₂ is x = 0.97 atm, and the equilibrium partial pressure of CO is 2 - 2x = 2 - 2(0.97) = 2 - 1.94 = 0.06 atm.

Wait, that seems a bit low for CO, but let's proceed.

Now, the K_p expression is (P_SO2) / (P_CO)^2.

Plugging in the values:

K_p = (0.97) / (0.06)^2

Calculating the denominator: 0.06^2 = 0.0036

So 0.97 / 0.0036 ≈ 269.44 atm^-1.

Looking at the options, option J is 269.44 atm^-1. So that must be the answer.

To calculate the equilibrium constant \( K_p \) for the reaction \( S(s) + 2CO(g) \leftrightarrow SO_2(g) + 2C(s) \), we focus on the gaseous species, as solids do not contribute to the equilibrium expression. The reaction's \( K_p \) is given by:

\[
K_p = \frac{P_{SO_2}}{(P_{CO})^2}
\]

### Step 1: Initial and equilibrium pressures
- Initial pressure of \( CO \): \( 2 \, \text{atm} \)
- Initial pressure of \( SO_2 \): \( 0 \, \text{atm} \)
- Total equilibrium pressure: \( 1.03 \, \text{atm} \)

Let the change in pressure of \( CO \) be \( -2x \) (since 2 moles of \( CO \) are consumed) and the change in pressure of \( SO_2 \) be \( +x \) (since 1 mole of \( SO_2 \) is produced). At equilibrium:

\[
P_{CO} = 2 - 2x, \quad P_{SO_2} = x
\]

The total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of \( CO \) and \( SO_2 \):

\[
P_{\text{total}} = (2 - 2x) + x = 2 - x
\]

Given \( P_{\text{total}} = 1.03 \, \text{atm} \):

\[
2 - x = 1.03 \implies x = 0.97 \, \text{atm}
\]

Thus:

\[
P_{SO_2} = 0.97 \, \text{atm}, \quad P_{CO} = 2 - 2(0.97) = 0.06 \, \text{atm}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( K_p \)
Substitute the equilibrium pressures into the \( K_p \) expression:

\[
K_p = \frac{P_{SO_2}}{(P_{CO})^2} = \frac{0.97}{(0.06)^2} = \frac{0.97}{0.0036} \approx 269.44 \, \text{atm}^{-1}
\]

### Final Answer:
The equilibrium constant \( K_p \) is \( 269.44 \, \text{atm}^{-1} \).
