Okay, so I've got this question in front of me about square feet and square inches. Hmm, let me see. The question is asking which measurement equals one square foot, and I have options from A to J. Alright, I need to figure this out step by step.

First off, I remember that converting square feet to square inches involves knowing the conversion factor between feet and inches. I know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So, if I have a square that's 1 foot on each side, the area would be 1 foot multiplied by 1 foot, which is 1 square foot. But I need to express this in square inches instead.

Wait, right, to convert square feet to square inches, I can't just multiply by 12 because that would give me the area in linear inches, not square inches. So, I think I need to square the conversion factor. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, then 1 square foot should be (12 inches) squared. Let me calculate that: 12 times 12 is 144. So, 1 square foot is equal to 144 square inches. Okay, that makes sense.

Now, looking at the options, I need to find which one is 144 square inches. Let me go through each choice. Option A is 150, which is a bit higher than 144. B is 300, that's way too big. C is 100, nope. D is 50, too small. E is 225, still higher. F is 77, not it. G is 125, close but not 144. H is 144, that's exactly what I'm looking for. I is 200, which is too high, and J is 175, also too high. So, the correct answer must be H.

Wait, just to double-check, I'll visualize a square. If each side is 12 inches, then the area is 12 * 12 = 144. Yep, that's correct. So, option H is the one.

The correct answer is H: 144 square inches.
