Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the free electron gas theory and estimating the average speed of valence electrons in copper. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that according to the free electron gas theory, the average kinetic energy E of the free electrons is (3/5) of the Fermi energy E_F. The Fermi energy for copper is given as 7 eV. I need to find the average speed of these electrons.

Wait, right, the Fermi energy is the highest energy level occupied by electrons at absolute zero temperature. But in this case, the average kinetic energy is 3/5 of E_F. So first, I'll calculate that kinetic energy.

So E = (3/5) * E_F. Plugging in the numbers, E = (3/5) * 7 eV. Let me compute that: 3 times 7 is 21, divided by 5 gives 4.2 eV. So the average kinetic energy is 4.2 eV.

But wait, I need to convert this energy into joules because the formulas for kinetic energy use joules. I remember that 1 eV is equal to 1.602 x 10^-19 joules. So 4.2 eV multiplied by 1.602e-19 J/eV. Let me calculate that: 4.2 * 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.7284e-19 J. So E ≈ 6.73e-19 J.

Now, the kinetic energy of a particle is given by (1/2)mv², where m is the mass and v is the velocity. So I can set up the equation: (1/2)mv² = E.

I need to solve for v. Rearranging the equation: v = sqrt(2E/m).

The mass of an electron, m, is 9.109e-31 kg. So plugging in the values: E is 6.73e-19 J, m is 9.109e-31 kg.

Let me compute 2E: 2 * 6.73e-19 = 1.346e-18 J. Now divide that by m: 1.346e-18 / 9.109e-31 ≈ 1.477e12 (kg·m²/s²) / kg → m²/s². Then take the square root of that to get v.

So sqrt(1.477e12) ≈ 3.843e6 m/s. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see that exact number. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculations somewhere. Let me go through the steps again.

First, E is (3/5)*7 eV = 4.2 eV. Convert to joules: 4.2 * 1.602e-19 = 6.7284e-19 J.

Kinetic energy equation: (1/2)mv² = 6.7284e-19 J.

So v = sqrt(2E/m).

Calculating 2E: 2 * 6.7284e-19 = 1.34568e-18 J.

Divide by m (9.109e-31 kg): 1.34568e-18 / 9.109e-31 ≈ 1.477e12.

Square root of 1.477e12 is approximately sqrt(1.477) * 1e6. sqrt(1.477) is about 1.215, so 1.215e6 m/s.

Wait, that's 1.215e6 m/s. Looking at the options, option B is 1.21e6, and option F is 2.6e6, G is 2.2e6. Oh, so option B is 1.21 × 10^6 m/s. That seems to match my calculation.

Wait, but I thought maybe I messed up somewhere. Let me double-check the steps.

Wait, when I squared 1.21e6, I get (1.21e6)^2 = 1.4641e12. Which is close to the 1.477e12 I had earlier. So that makes sense.

So the average speed should be approximately 1.21e6 m/s, which is option B.

To estimate the average speed of valence electrons in copper, we start by using the given information from the free electron gas theory. The average kinetic energy \( E \) of the electrons is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the Fermi energy \( E_F \). For copper, \( E_F = 7 \, \text{eV} \).

1. Calculate the average kinetic energy:
   \[
   E = \frac{3}{5} \times 7 \, \text{eV} = 4.2 \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. Convert the kinetic energy from electron volts to joules using \( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \):
   \[
   E = 4.2 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \approx 6.7284 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]

3. Use the kinetic energy formula \( \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = E \) to solve for \( v \), where \( m = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \) is the mass of an electron:
   \[
   v = \sqrt{\frac{2E}{m}}.
   \]

4. Substitute the values:
   \[
   v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 6.7284 \times 10^{-19}}{9.109 \times 10^{-31}}}.
   \]

5. Simplify the expression:
   \[
   v = \sqrt{\frac{1.34568 \times 10^{-18}}{9.109 \times 10^{-31}}} \approx \sqrt{1.477 \times 10^{12}} \approx 1.215 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s}.
   \]

Comparing this result with the provided options, the closest match is **B: \( 1.21 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s} \)**.
