Question:

A 42-year-old woman comes to the physician because of an 8-week history of intermittent nausea and abdominal pain that occurs 20 to 30 minutes after eating. The pain extends from the epigastrium to the right upper quadrant and is sometimes felt in the right scapula; it lasts about 30 minutes and is not relieved by antacids. The last episode occurred after she ate a hamburger and french fries. She has not had vomiting. She is currently asymptomatic. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 104 kg (230 lb); BMI is 38 kg/m2 . Examination shows no other abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:

A: Abdominal ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant
B: Upper gastrointestinal series with small bowel follow-through
C: CT scan of the abdomen
D: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the next step in managing this patient. Let me go through the details again.

The patient is a 42-year-old woman with an 8-week history of intermittent nausea and abdominal pain. The pain starts 20-30 minutes after eating. It's located in the epigastrium and radiates to the right upper quadrant, sometimes even to the right scapula. Each episode lasts about 30 minutes and isn't relieved by antacids. Her last episode was after eating a hamburger and fries, and she hasn't vomited. Currently, she's asymptomatic, which is good.

Her physical exam is normal except for her BMI being 38, which is quite high. So she's obese. Obesity can sometimes contribute to gastrointestinal issues, so that's a factor to consider.

Looking at her symptoms, the pain after eating, in the epigastric area, radiating to the right upper quadrant and scapulaâ€”this sounds a lot like gallbladder-related pain, like cholecystitis. Gallstones can cause biliary colic, which often presents with pain after eating, especially fatty foods. But the pain isn't relieved by antacids, which might suggest it's not acid-related, like a simple dyspepsia.

Another possibility is peptic ulcer disease, but the radiation to the scapula is more typical of gallbladder issues. Also, antacids not helping points away from acid-related causes. Maybe a hiatal hernia, but again, the pain pattern and radiation are more gallbladder.

Her weight is significant. Gallstones are more common in obese individuals, especially women. So I'm leaning towards gallstones or cholecystitis as the likely diagnosis.

Now, the options given are A through D. Let's think about each:

A: Abdominal ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant. Ultrasound is the first-line imaging for gallbladder issues because it's non-invasive and can detect stones or gallbladder wall thickening. It's also good for the liver and other structures in that area.

B: Upper gastrointestinal series with small bowel follow-through. This is more for evaluating the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine. Since her symptoms are postprandial and pointing towards the gallbladder, this might not be the first choice unless we suspect something like a hiatal hernia or peptic ulcer, but her symptoms don't strongly suggest that. Plus, she didn't respond to antacids, so maybe not acid-related.

C: CT scan of the abdomen. CT is good for detailed imaging, especially if ultrasound is inconclusive or if there's suspicion of other issues like appendicitis or pancreatitis. But since ultrasound is more specific for gallbladder, maybe CT isn't the first step.

D: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). ERCP is more invasive and is usually done when there's suspicion of stones in the common bile duct or if there's obstruction. It's not typically the first step in an asymptomatic patient; it's more for when other tests suggest a problem.

So putting it together, the most appropriate next step is likely an abdominal ultrasound to check for gallstones or gallbladder issues. It's the least invasive and most direct way to assess her symptoms.
</think>

The patient's symptoms, including postprandial pain radiating to the right upper quadrant and scapula, along with her obesity, suggest gallbladder-related issues such as gallstones or cholecystitis. Abdominal ultrasonography is the most appropriate next step to evaluate the gallbladder and detect potential stones or inflammation.
