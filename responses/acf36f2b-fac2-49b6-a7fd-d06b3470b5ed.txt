Question:

Congress enacted a statute designed to make the stabilization of rents more effective throughout the United States. The statute will be applicable to all leasehold contracts hereafter entered into between landlords and tenants involving residential and commercial properties. The new federal statute is intended to protect tenants from spiraling rents and "profiteering" by landlords without curtailing the supply of rental units or depriving landlords of substantial constitutional rights. The new federal statute would be most clearly constitutional as applied to

Options:

A: the rental of a vacation home by an individual landlord to a family on a short-term lease.
B: the rental of a state-owned office building by a state to a privately owned business.
C: the rental of a college dormitory by a private university to its students.
D: the rental of residential property located in the District of Columbia by an individual landlord to a family of six.
E: the rental of an office building to a city by an individual landlord.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about constitutional law, specifically dealing with Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a new federal statute that stabilizes rents for leasehold contracts involving residential and commercial properties. The statute is meant to protect tenants from rent spikes and "profiteering" by landlords without affecting the rental supply or infringing on landlords' constitutional rights.

The key here is to determine under which scenario this statute would be constitutional. The options are A through E, each describing a different type of rental situation.

I remember that the Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to regulate activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce. For a federal law to be constitutional, the activity it regulates must be economic and have a substantial connection to interstate commerce.

Looking at the options:

Option A: An individual landlord renting a vacation home to a family on a short-term lease. This is a local transaction, probably between two individuals. Unless the rental affects interstate commerce in some way, like being part of a larger commercial activity, it might not have a direct impact. But vacation homes could be part of a broader tourism industry, which does have interstate aspects. Not sure yet.

Option B: A state renting its own office building to a private business. The state is involved here. I think the Supreme Court has ruled that when states are acting as sovereigns, like in their governmental functions, Congress can't regulate them under the Commerce Clause. This is because of the principle of state sovereignty and the Tenth Amendment. So a state-owned property might be exempt from federal regulation.

Option C: A private university renting dormitories to students. Universities can be part of the educational sector, which does have interstate elements, like students coming from other states. Dormitory rentals are part of the educational service. But I'm not certain if this would be considered a direct enough impact on interstate commerce. It might not be as clear as other options.

Option D: Residential property in the District of Columbia (DC) rented by an individual landlord to a family. DC is a federal district, so any regulation here would be under Congress's direct authority. Congress has plenary power over the District, meaning it can pass laws that would apply to local matters, including rent control. So this might be a clear case where the statute is constitutional because DC is under federal jurisdiction.

Option E: An individual landlord renting an office building to a city. Similar to option B, this involves a city (a local government) as a tenant. If the landlord is a private individual and the tenant is the city, would the federal statute apply? Again, the issue here is whether the state or local government's actions are immune. But in this case, the landlord is private, so maybe the lease is subject to federal regulation if it affects interstate commerce. However, cities are subdivisions of states, so their actions might fall under state sovereignty as well.

Now, thinking about past cases, like the Supreme Court decisions in cases such as United States v. Guest (1966), where the Court held that Congress could regulate under the Commerce Clause if the state action was involved in a way that affected interstate commerce. But in more recent cases, like Printz v. United States (1997), the Court ruled that the federal government couldn't commandeer state governments into enforcing federal laws.

But in this question, the focus is on the application to different entities. The statute applies to leasehold contracts between landlords and tenants. So if the landlord is a private individual, and the tenant is either a private business or a state, the federal law would apply unless the state is acting in a sovereign capacity.

In option B, the state is the landlord, so it's acting in its sovereign capacity. The Supreme Court has held that states have immunity from certain federal regulations under the Commerce Clause when they're acting as sovereigns. So a state renting its own property might not be subject to the federal statute.

In option D, the property is in DC, which is under Congress's direct authority. So any law Congress passes for DC would apply, regardless of the usual Commerce Clause limitations. Therefore, the statute would be constitutional here because Congress has the power to regulate within the District.

Option E involves a city as the tenant. Since cities are part of state governments, they might have immunity, but the landlord is private. The lease would be a private transaction, so perhaps the federal statute would apply unless the city's status as a governmental entity affects it. However, I'm not entirely sure about that scenario.

So, putting it all together, the statute would be constitutional in the District of Columbia because Congress has exclusive jurisdiction there. In other cases where states or local governments are involved, the statute might not apply due to state sovereignty. Therefore, the correct answer should be option D.

The correct answer is D. Congress has exclusive jurisdiction over the District of Columbia, allowing the statute to apply there. Other options involve state or local governments, which may have sovereignty immunity under the Commerce Clause.

Answer: D
