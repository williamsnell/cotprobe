Question:

A 10-year-old girl is brought to the office by her mother because her school nurse thinks that she may have Marfan syndrome. She is at the 95th percentile for height and 25th percentile for weight. Physical examination shows a narrow palate with dental crowding, long slender extremities, and joint laxity. Molecular testing for FBN1 shows a single nucleotide difference that does not change the amino acid at that locus. Her mother is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall. There is no clinical evidence of Marfan syndrome in the mother, but she has the same single nucleotide change as the patient. The same nucleotide change is found in 15 of 200 individuals without Marfan syndrome. Which of the following best describes the single nucleotide change in the patient and her mother?

Options:

A: It is a disease-causing mutation in the patient and her mother
B: It is a polymorphism
C: It is a sequence variant of unknown significance
D: It will change the folding of the protein

Answer:

Okay, so I've got this medical genetics question here about Marfan syndrome. Let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think through it step by step.

The patient is a 10-year-old girl who's referred because the school nurse thinks she might have Marfan syndrome. Her height is at the 95th percentile, which means she's really tallâ€”like taller than 95% of kids her age. But her weight is at the 25th percentile, so she's on the lighter side. Physical exam findings include a narrow palate with dental crowding, long and slender extremities, and joint laxity. Those are all classic signs of Marfan syndrome, right? I remember that Marfan involves connective tissue issues, leading to tall stature, long limbs, and hypermobile joints.

Molecular testing for FBN1, which is the gene associated with Marfan syndrome, shows a single nucleotide difference. But importantly, this difference doesn't change the amino acid at that position. Wait, so it's a synonymous change? Synonymous mutations are those where the DNA changes but the protein remains the same because it's a codon that codes for the same amino acid. So, no change in the amino acid sequence.

Now, looking at the family history: the mother is 163 cm, which is 5 ft 4 in. She doesn't have any clinical signs of Marfan either. But she has the same single nucleotide change as the patient. Also, the same change is found in 15 out of 200 individuals without Marfan. Hmm, so in the general population, 15% have this change and don't have the syndrome.

So, what does this mean? Well, if the mutation is in the mother and the daughter, but neither shows signs of the disease, and it's a common change in the population, it's probably not a disease-causing mutation. Because if it were, you'd expect at least one of them to have the disease, especially if it's autosomal dominant like Marfan.

But wait, Marfan is caused by mutations in FBN1, and it's autosomal dominant. Usually, a pathogenic mutation would present with the condition. But in this case, the change doesn't alter the protein, so maybe it's a polymorphism. Polymorphisms are common variations in the population that don't cause disease. Since 15% of the population has this same change without disease, it's likely a benign polymorphism.

Looking at the options:

A: Disease-causing in both. Unlikely because the mother and the 15% don't have the disease.

B: It's a polymorphism. Seems possible. Because it's common and doesn't change the protein, it's probably just a normal variation.

C: Sequence variant of unknown significance. That's when the effect isn't clear, but here it seems it's not causing the disease.

D: Changes protein folding. No, because the amino acid is the same, so the protein structure isn't altered.

So the best answer is B: It is a polymorphism.
</think>

The patient and her mother share a single nucleotide change in the FBN1 gene, which does not alter the amino acid sequence. This change is also present in 15% of individuals without Marfan syndrome, indicating it is likely a benign polymorphism. There is no evidence that this change causes disease, as neither the patient nor her mother exhibits clinical signs of Marfan syndrome. Therefore, the single nucleotide change is best described as a polymorphism.

Answer: B
