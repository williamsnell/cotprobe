Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about group theory, and I need to figure out whether the two statements are true or false. Let me take it step by step.

The question has two statements:

1. Every group of order 159 is cyclic.
2. Every group of order 102 has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup.

The options are from A to J, each combining a truth value for the first and second statements. I need to determine the correct combination.

Starting with Statement 1: Every group of order 159 is cyclic.

Hmm, I remember that the order of a group is the number of elements in it. So 159 is the order here. To determine if every group of this order is cyclic, I should factorize 159 first. Let's see, 159 divided by 3 is 53. So 159 = 3 × 53. Both 3 and 53 are prime numbers. 

I recall that if a group's order is the product of two distinct primes, say p and q, where p < q and q is not a multiple of p, then the group is cyclic. This is due to the structure theorem for finite abelian groups, which says that a group of order pq (with p and q primes) is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order pq. But wait, is this always true?

Wait, another thought: There's a theorem called Sylow's theorems that could help here. For a group of order pq (p and q primes, p < q), the number of Sylow p-subgroups is congruent to 1 mod p. If that number is 1, then the Sylow p-subgroup is normal, and similarly for Sylow q-subgroups.

In our case, 159 = 3 × 53. Let's check the number of Sylow 3-subgroups. The number n_3 must divide 53 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. 53 is prime, so the possible divisors are 1 and 53. 53 mod 3 is 2, which isn't 1 mod 3, so n_3 must be 1. That means the Sylow 3-subgroup is normal. Similarly, for Sylow 53-subgroups, n_53 must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 mod 53. The divisors are 1 and 3. 3 mod 53 is 3, which isn't 1, so n_53 must be 1. So both Sylow subgroups are normal and unique, hence the group is the direct product of these two cyclic subgroups. Since 3 and 53 are coprime, the direct product is cyclic. Therefore, every group of order 159 is cyclic. So Statement 1 is True.

Moving on to Statement 2: Every group of order 102 has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup.

Order 102. Let's factorize that. 102 = 2 × 3 × 17. So it's the product of three distinct primes. Now, does every group of order 102 have a nontrivial proper normal subgroup? 

I remember that groups of order n where n has multiple prime factors may or may not be simple. A simple group has no nontrivial proper normal subgroups. So I need to check if a group of order 102 is necessarily non-simple, meaning it must have a normal subgroup.

Alternatively, can a group of order 102 be simple? Let's think using Sylow's theorems.

First, let's compute the number of Sylow p-subgroups for each prime divisor.

For p=2: The number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 51 (since 102/2=51) and be congruent to 1 mod 2. So possible n_2 are 1, 3, 17, 51.

For p=3: n_3 must divide 34 (102/3=34) and be congruent to 1 mod 3. So possible n_3 are 1, 2, 17, 34.

For p=17: n_17 must divide 6 (102/17=6) and be congruent to 1 mod 17. The possible divisors are 1 and 6. 6 mod 17 is 6, which isn't 1, so n_17 must be 1. That means the Sylow 17-subgroup is normal. 

Wait, if n_17=1, then the Sylow 17-subgroup is normal in G. So G has a normal subgroup of order 17, which is cyclic (since 17 is prime). Therefore, G has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup. So Statement 2 is True.

Wait, but let me double-check. If n_17=1, then it's normal, so yes, G has a normal subgroup of order 17. Therefore, the group cannot be simple because it has a normal subgroup. So every group of order 102 must have a normal subgroup of order 17, so Statement 2 is True.

So both statements are True. Let me look at the options. Option D is True, True. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but I should make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me quickly verify again.

For Statement 1: 159=3×53. Both primes. Using Sylow, n_3=1 and n_53=1. So G is cyclic. Correct.

For Statement 2: 102=2×3×17. Sylow 17-subgroups must be unique and hence normal. So G has a normal subgroup of order 17. Therefore, Statement 2 is True.

So both statements are True. The correct option is D.
</think>

The first statement is true because every group of order 159 is cyclic, as shown by Sylow's theorems. The second statement is also true because every group of order 102 has a normal subgroup of order 17.
