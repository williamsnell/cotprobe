Okay, so I have this question about Aronson and Mills' study on initiation into a group and how it affects subsequent attitudes toward the group. The question is asking what happened when women underwent a severe initiation compared to those with a mild one. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that Aronson and Mills did a study where they looked at the effect of initiation difficulty on group attitudes. From what I recall, the idea is that if someone goes through a tough initiation to join a group, they might feel more attached or have more positive feelings about the group compared to those who had an easy time joining. This is because overcoming a challenge can create a stronger sense of belonging or commitment.

So the question is about comparing severe initiation to mild. The options are various outcomes like dropping out, rating the group as less interesting, feeling alienated, etc. I think the key here is that the more difficult the initiation, the more positive the attitude toward the group. That's because people justify their effort by convincing themselves the group is valuable.

Looking at the options, H says "rated the group as more interesting and enjoyable." That aligns with what I remember. People who went through a hard time to join would perceive the group more positively. Let me check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something.

Option A says more likely to drop out. That doesn't fit because if initiation is hard, they're more committed, so less likely to drop out. Option B is less interesting, which would be the opposite of what happens. Option C is more alienated, but I think the opposite happensâ€”stronger identification. Option D is more indifferent, which doesn't seem right. E says less likely to contribute, but I think they'd be more active. F is more likely to lead, maybe, but I'm not sure that's the main finding. G is more likely to dislike others, which I don't recall. I is less likely to recommend, which again seems opposite because they like the group more. J is less satisfaction, which is wrong.

So the correct answer should be H: rated the group as more interesting and enjoyable. That's because the severe initiation leads to more positive attitudes, a phenomenon known as the "Aronson effect."

The correct answer is H: rated the group as more interesting and enjoyable. Severe initiation leads to more positive attitudes due to the "Aronson effect," where individuals justify their effort by valuing the group more.
