The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"The Opposition tells us that we ought not to govern a people without their consent. I answer, the rule of liberty that all just government derives its authority from the consent of the governed, applies only to those who are capable of self-government. We govern the Indians without their consent, we govern our territories without their consent, we govern our children without their consent. How do they know that our government would be without their consent? Would not the people of the Philippines prefer the just, human, civilizing government of this Republic to the savage, bloody rule of pillage and extortion from which we have rescued them? And, regardless of this formula of words made only for enlightened, self-governing people, do we owe no duty to the world? Shall we turn these peoples back to the reeking hands from which we have taken them? Shall we abandon them, with Germany, England, Japan, hungering for them? Shall we save them from those nations, to give them a self-rule of tragedy?â€¦Then, like men and not like children, let us on to our tasks, our mission, and our destiny."
Albert J. Beveridge, "The March of the Flag," 1898
Which of the following rationales does Beveridge employ in his argument?

Options:

A: Governing territories confers economic benefits to both European and nonwhite nations.
B: The United States is obligated to expand its territory for the sake of national security.
C: The closing of the western frontier impels the United States to expand its territory overseas.
D: Powerful nations have a moral duty to govern less developed nations.

Answer:

Okay, so I need to figure out which rationale Albert J. Beveridge is using in his argument. Let me start by reading the passage carefully. 

He starts by addressing the Opposition's point that the U.S. shouldn't govern people without their consent. He counters by saying that the principle of government deriving authority from the consent of the governed only applies to those capable of self-government. So he's arguing that it's okay to govern others without their consent if they aren't capable of self-governing.

He gives examples like governing Indians, territories, and children, implying that these groups can't govern themselves. Then he asks how the Opposition knows the government is without consent, suggesting that the people in the Philippines would prefer the U.S. government over their previous rulers. He refers to the U.S. government as "just, human, civilizing," contrasting it with the "savage, bloody rule" they had before. 

He also talks about a "duty to the world" and whether the U.S. should abandon these people to other nations like Germany, England, or Japan, which are described as hungry and possibly threatening. He questions if the U.S. should save them from those nations only to give them a tragic self-rule. 

Finally, he concludes by urging the U.S. to take on its tasks, mission, and destiny, likening them to adults rather than children.

Looking at the options:

A: Talks about economic benefits to European and nonwhite nations. The passage doesn't mention economy or benefits to other nations, so probably not A.

B: National security expansion. No mention of security, so B seems unrelated.

C: Closing of the western frontier leading to overseas expansion. The passage doesn't discuss the frontier; it's more about moral duty, so C might not be it.

D: Powerful nations have a moral duty to govern less developed nations. This fits because Beveridge is arguing that the U.S. has a duty to civilize and govern others who aren't capable, implying a moral obligation.

So, the answer should be D.

The rationale Beveridge employs is that powerful nations have a moral duty to govern less developed nations. He argues that the U.S. should civilize and protect these peoples from other nations, framing it as a moral obligation.

Answer: D
