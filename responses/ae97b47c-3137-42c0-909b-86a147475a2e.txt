Question:

Which statement about absorption from the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract is most correct?


Options:

A: The absorption of glucose is associated with sodium uptake.
B: Fructose is absorbed more rapidly than glucose.
C: Galactose and fructose are absorbed by the same transporter at the brush border membrane.
D: Most water absorption along the GI tract occurs in the colon.

Answer:

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about absorption from the GI tract, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me go through each option one by one and think about what I remember from my studies.

The question is asking which statement is the most correct regarding absorption from the GI tract. The options are A through D.

Starting with option A: "The absorption of glucose is associated with sodium uptake." Hmm. I remember that glucose absorption in the small intestine is facilitated by a cotransporter. So when glucose is absorbed into the enterocytes, it's accompanied by the uptake of sodium ions. This makes sense because sodium is a key driver for many transport processes in the gut. So A seems correct.

Option B: "Fructose is absorbed more rapidly than glucose." Wait, I think glucose is actually absorbed more rapidly than fructose. Fructose absorption is slower because it's taken up by a different transporter, and I recall that fructose can cause a slower rise in blood sugar levels compared to glucose. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C: "Galactose and fructose are absorbed by the same transporter at the brush border membrane." I remember that galactose and glucose use the same transporter, SGLT1, which is a sodium-glucose cotransporter. Fructose, on the other hand, uses a different transporter, GLUT5. So they don't share the same transporter. Therefore, C is incorrect.

Option D: "Most water absorption along the GI tract occurs in the colon." I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I know that a significant amount of water is absorbed in the small intestine, especially in the jejunum and ileum. The colon does absorb some water, especially during digestion, but I thought that the majority isn't in the colon. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing this up. Let me think again. The large intestine (colon) is where a lot of water is reabsorbed, especially after forming feces in the rectum. So perhaps D is correct. Or maybe most absorption is in the small intestine? I'm not entirely sure. I think that the small intestine absorbs the majority of water, but the colon also absorbs a significant amount, especially in the case of diarrhea where a lot of water is lost and needs to be reabsorbed. But the question says "most." I'm a bit uncertain here.

Wait, going back to the options. The question is about which statement is correct.

So, A: Glucose with sodium â€“ correct.

D: Most water absorption in the colon. I think the colon does absorb a lot of water, but the majority might be in the small intestine. Let me double-check. The small intestine, especially the ileum, is where most nutrients and a lot of water are absorbed. The colon's main role is to absorb water and some electrolytes, but not the majority. So D might be incorrect.

So the correct statements would be A and D. Wait, but I thought D was incorrect. Wait, no. Let me clarify: the colon is where a significant amount of water is absorbed, but the majority is in the small intestine. So D is incorrect because most water absorption isn't in the colon.

So the correct answers among the options are A and possibly D, but I think D is wrong.

Wait, another angle: The colon is the site of most water absorption because it's the largest part of the GI tract and has a lot of surface area. Or maybe not. I think the small intestine handles most absorption because that's where most nutrients are. So D is incorrect.

So the correct statements are A and possibly C or D. Wait, no, C is wrong. So the correct answer is A.

Wait, but let me make sure about D. I think the colon absorbs a significant amount of water, but the majority is in the small intestine. So D is incorrect.

So the correct answer is A: The absorption of glucose is associated with sodium uptake.

The correct answer is **A**. Glucose absorption in the small intestine involves a sodium-glucose cotransporter, meaning it is associated with sodium uptake. Fructose is absorbed more slowly than glucose, and galactose and fructose use different transporters. Most water absorption occurs in the small intestine, not the colon, making option D incorrect.

**Answer: A**
