Okay, so I have this question about a retailer's database and what can be determined from it. Let me try to break it down.

The retailer sells footwear and has a database with the following information for each item:

- Item ID
- Footwear type (like sneakers, boots, etc.)
- Selling price in dollars
- Size
- Color
- Quantity available

The question is asking which of the options A through E can be determined using only this database. I need to figure out which one is possible.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Which items listed in the database are not currently in the store. Hmm, the database has "quantity available," so if the quantity is zero, that would mean the item isn't in the store. So I think A is possible because the database includes quantity, so we can check which items have zero available.

Option B: Which type of footwear is most popular among adults. Wait, the database doesn't have information about the customers, like who bought them. It only has info about the items, not their buyers. So we can't determine popularity among adults specifically. So B is probably not possible.

Option C: The total profit made from selling a particular type of footwear. Profit would require knowing the cost price, right? But the database only has selling price. Without knowing the cost, we can't calculate profit. So C might not be possible unless there's another way, but I don't think so. So I think C isn't possible.

Option D: Which colors are more popular among men than women. Again, the database doesn't track customer demographics. It only has info about the items, not who bought them. So we can't determine popularity based on gender. So D is not possible.

Option E: The total number of shoes sold in a particular month. Wait, the database doesn't track sales data over time. It only has the quantity available. Unless they have a separate sales database, but the question says using only the database, which I think refers to the one described. So without sales records, like how many were sold each month, E might not be possible. Unless the "quantity available" is updated when items are sold, but the question doesn't mention sales data. So I'm not sure about E.

Wait, but let me think again. The database has "quantity available," but it's just a record of what's in stock. To know how many were sold, you'd need sales data. So E is probably not possible.

So going back, the options that seem possible are A. Because the database has quantity available, so items with zero are not in the store.

Wait, but the question is about using only the database. So maybe A is correct.

Wait, let me check again.

Option A: Items not in the store. Since the database has quantity available, any item with zero quantity would be not in the store. So yes, A is possible.

So the answer should be A.

The correct answer is A. The database contains the "quantity available" for each item, allowing us to identify items not currently in the store by checking for a quantity of zero.

Answer: A
