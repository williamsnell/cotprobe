Question:

Which of the following is the proper treatment of the cost of equipment used in research and development activities that will have alternative future uses?

Options:

A: Capitalized and depreciated over the term of the research and development project.
B: Expensed as incurred, regardless of the project's term or future use.
C: Capitalized and depreciated over its estimated useful life.
D: Expensed in the year in which the research and development project started.
E: Either capitalized or expensed, but not both, depending on the term of the research and development project.
F: Capitalized but not depreciated.
G: Capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the research and development project, unless the equipment has no alternative future uses.
H: Either capitalized or expensed, depending on the potential success of the research and development project.
I: Expensed in the year in which the research and development project is completed.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this accounting question about the treatment of equipment costs used in R&D activities that have alternative future uses. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that in accounting, the treatment of costs depends on whether they are considered expenses or assets. For R&D activities, I think costs are generally expensed as they're incurred because R&D is often seen as a current-period expense unless it meets certain criteria for capitalization.

The question is specifically about equipment used in R&D. So, if the equipment is used solely for R&D and has no other use, I believe it should be expensed. But here, the equipment does have alternative future uses, which might change things.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me recall the rules. Under GAAP, costs related to R&D are typically expensed unless they meet specific criteria for capitalization. One of those criteria is whether the item has alternative future uses. If the equipment can be used for something else after the R&D project, then it might be considered a separate asset and thus capitalized.

So, in this case, since the equipment has alternative future uses, it's probably not expensed immediately. Instead, it should be capitalized as an asset because it provides future economic benefits beyond the R&D project. Once capitalized, it would be depreciated over its useful life.

Looking at the options, option C says "Capitalized and depreciated over its estimated useful life." That makes sense because the equipment has alternative uses, so it's treated as a long-term asset, not an expense.

Option A talks about depreciating over the R&D project term, which doesn't seem right because the equipment might be used beyond that project. Option E suggests either capitalizing or expensing based on the project term, but I think the key factor is the alternative use, not the project's term.

Option G says capitalize and depreciate over the project's life unless no alternative use. That seems close, but I think the correct approach is to always capitalize if there's alternative use, regardless of the project's term. So, option C is more accurate.

The proper treatment of the cost of equipment used in research and development (R&D) activities that has alternative future uses is to capitalize the cost and depreciate it over the equipment's estimated useful life. This is because the equipment provides future economic benefits beyond the R&D project, meeting the criteria for asset treatment under accounting standards.

Answer: C
