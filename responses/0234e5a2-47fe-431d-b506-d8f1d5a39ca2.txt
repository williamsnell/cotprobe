Question:

Explain the term "psychosis" and the distinction between functionaland organic psychoses.

Options:

A: Psychosis is characterized by persistent happiness and clarity of thought
B: Psychosis is a minor mental disorder
C: Organic psychosis results from voluntary substance abuse, whereas functional psychosis is always congenital
D: Organic psychosis is typically induced by changes in the weather or climate
E: Organic psychosis is caused by psychological trauma
F: A psychosis is a severe mental disorder causing impaired thinking and emotion. Organic psychosis is caused by impaired brain functioning due to structural lesions or disease, while functional psychosis does not have any apparent pathological changes in the brain.
G: Functional psychosis is a form of psychosis that only occurs in older adults
H: Functional psychosis is caused by physical brain damage
I: Psychosis is a mild condition that improves without treatment
J: Functional psychosis is caused by infectious diseases, while organic psychosis is a result of genetic factors

Okay, so I've got this question about psychosis and the difference between functional and organic psychoses. I'm a bit rusty on my psychology terms, but I'll try to think it through.

First, what's psychosis? From what I remember, psychosis is a severe mental disorder. It affects how a person thinks, feels, and perceives reality. They might experience hallucinations or delusions, right? So, someone with psychosis might not be able to tell what's real and what isn't. That makes sense.

Now, the question asks about the distinction between functional and organic psychoses. I think organic psychoses have a physical cause, like something wrong in the brain. Maybe it's due to brain damage, infections, or other medical conditions. On the other hand, functional psychoses might be more related to psychological factors. But I'm not entirely sure if that's accurate.

Looking at the options:

Option A says psychosis is characterized by persistent happiness and clarity of thought. That doesn't sound right. Psychosis usually involves confusion and altered perceptions, not clarity.

Option B says it's a minor disorder. No, I'm pretty sure psychosis is severe, not minor.

Option C claims organic psychosis is from voluntary substance abuse, and functional is always congenital. That doesn't make sense. Substances can cause organic issues, but organic can also be from things like infections or trauma. Also, functional doesn't have to be only genetic.

Option D says organic is due to weather changes. That seems off. I don't think the weather causes psychosis.

Option E says organic is caused by psychological trauma. Wait, isn't trauma more of a psychological factor, which might relate to functional psychosis? Or maybe it's a cause for both? I'm not certain.

Option F states psychosis is a severe mental disorder causing impaired thinking and emotion. Organic is due to brain issues like lesions or disease, while functional doesn't have apparent brain changes. This aligns with what I was thinking earlier. Organic has a physical cause, functional might be more psychological.

Option G says functional only occurs in older adults. I don't think that's true. Psychosis can affect people of any age.

Option H says functional is caused by physical brain damage. No, that's more like organic. Functional would be due to psychological factors, I think.

Option I says psychosis is mild and improves without treatment. No, it's severe and usually needs treatment.

Option J says functional is from infections, organic from genetics. Wait, that might be backwards. Infections would cause organic, and genetics could play a role in functional, but I'm not sure if that's the main distinction.

So, putting it all together, Option F seems to correctly define psychosis as severe and distinguishes organic from functional based on brain changes. Organic has physical causes, functional does not show such changes.

The term "psychosis" refers to a severe mental disorder that significantly impairs a person's thinking, feeling, and perception of reality. It often involves hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking. The distinction between functional and organic psychoses lies in their causes. Organic psychoses are rooted in physical brain changes, such as structural lesions, diseases, or infections, whereas functional psychoses do not show apparent pathological brain changes and are often linked to psychological factors or stress.
