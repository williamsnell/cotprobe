Question:

Define the term "debugging."

Options:

A: Debugging is the process of creating bugs.
B: Debugging refers to the enhancement of a program's performance without the need to fix faults.
C: Debugging means deploying a program.
D: Debugging is the compilation of source code into executable programs.
E: Debugging is the process of testing a program.
F: Debugging involves the systematic elimination of a computer virus from a program.
G: Debugging is the initial design and development phase of a program.
H: Debugging is the process of optimizing the user interface of a program.
I: Debugging a program means the modification of programs, throughout its lifetime, in order to fix the faults that produce unacceptable or unexpected results.
J: Debugging is the routine updating of software to add new features.

Okay, so I need to figure out what debugging means by looking at the given options. Let's start by recalling what I know about debugging. From what I remember, debugging is related to finding and fixing errors in software. It's like when a program isn't working right, and you have to figure out why and make it work correctly.

Looking at the options:

Option A says debugging is creating bugs. That doesn't sound right because creating bugs would be the opposite of debugging. Debugging is about fixing them, not making them.

Option B talks about enhancing performance without fixing faults. Wait, that's more about optimization, maybe, but I don't think it's the same as debugging. Debugging is about fixing issues, not just making it run better without addressing bugs.

Option C says debugging is deploying a program. Deployment is about putting the program into use, like releasing it to users. That's not debugging. Debugging happens before deployment when you're testing and fixing issues.

Option D mentions compiling source code. Compiling is a step in the development process where code is translated into an executable. That's not debugging. Debugging is after that, when you run the program and find issues.

Option E says debugging is testing a program. Hmm, testing is part of debugging, but I think debugging is a broader term. It's not just testing; it's specifically fixing the bugs found during testing.

Option F involves eliminating computer viruses. That sounds more like antivirus or malware removal, not debugging. Debugging is about software issues, not necessarily viruses.

Option G refers to the initial design and development phase. No, that's the development phase where you build the program. Debugging comes after when you're identifying and fixing issues.

Option H is about optimizing the user interface. That's more about usability and design, not about fixing bugs. So that's not it.

Option I states that debugging is modifying programs throughout their lifetime to fix faults that cause unexpected results. This sounds accurate. Debugging involves identifying bugs and making changes to fix them, whether during development or after the software is in use.

Option J is about updating software to add new features. That's more about maintenance or enhancements, not about fixing bugs. Debugging is about fixing, not adding new features.

So, putting it all together, the correct definition is in option I. It correctly describes debugging as the process of fixing faults in a program to make it work as intended.

The correct answer is I.
