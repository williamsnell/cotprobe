Question:

A shrimp fishery is located in the coastal waters of a state. A large part of the catch is either frozen or canned, and distributed nationwide. The state legislature passed a statute requiring payment of a license fee of $25 for each shrimp boat owned by a resident and $2,500 for each boat owned by a nonresident. A resident of a neighboring state was a commercial shrimp fisherman who was denied a license after refusing to pay the $2,500 fee. The resident brought suit in federal court challenging the constitutionality of the state shrimp boat licensing statute. The federal court should

Options:

A: hear the case on its merits.
B: abstain from jurisdiction because it involves the operations of a commercial business.
C: dismiss the case because the resident is not a citizen of the state implementing the statute.
D: dismiss the suit because it involves a question of state law.
E: hear the case but uphold the statute as it is within the state's rights to regulate its resources.
F: hear the case because it involves a potential violation of the Equal Protection Clause.
G: dismiss the suit because the resident lacks standing.
H: dismiss the suit because the resident has not exhausted all state-level legal remedies.
I: abstain from jurisdiction because the constitutional issue should be litigated first in a state court.
J: dismiss the suit because the federal court lacks jurisdiction over state legislature decisions.

Alright, so I've got this question about a shrimp fishery and a legal challenge in federal court. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: There's a shrimp fishery in coastal waters of a state. The catch is mostly frozen or canned and distributed nationwide. The state legislature passed a statute where shrimp boat licenses cost $25 for residents and $2,500 for nonresidents. A nonresident (from a neighboring state) was denied a license because he refused to pay the higher fee. He's suing in federal court, claiming the statute is unconstitutional.

The question is about what the federal court should do. The options are A through J, each suggesting a different action.

Okay, so I need to figure out which option is correct. Let's go through the key points.

1. **Jurisdiction in Federal Court**: The first thing to consider is whether the federal court has jurisdiction to hear the case. For a federal court to hear a case, there must be either diversity jurisdiction or a federal question.

   - **Diversity Jurisdiction**: The case would need to involve citizens from different states, and the amount in controversy must be over $75,000. Here, the plaintiff is a resident of a neighboring state suing the state where the shrimp fishery is located. So there is diversity because the plaintiff is from another state, and the defendant is the state. But wait, the state is being sued, so does that affect diversity? I think states are immune under the 11th Amendment unless they've waived it or Congress has abrogated it. But in this case, the plaintiff is suing the state, so maybe diversity isn't available because states are not considered "citizens" for diversity purposes. Hmm, but wait, the case is against the state's action, so perhaps the court would look at it under federal question jurisdiction instead.

   - **Federal Question Jurisdiction**: The case involves a constitutional issue, specifically about whether the state statute violates the Constitution. So, the federal court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331, which allows federal courts to hear cases arising under the Constitution, treaties, or federal laws.

2. **Constitutional Issue**: The statute charges nonresidents a much higher fee. The Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment prohibits states from denying any person equal protection of the laws. So, the question is whether the state's licensing fee discriminates against nonresidents without a sufficient reason.

   The state might argue that it's regulating its own resources (like coastal waters) and that nonresidents use more resources or have less stake in local regulations, justifying the higher fee. But courts usually require a rational basis for such distinctions. If the fee is based on something related to the use or impact on the state's resources, it might be upheld. But if it's just arbitrary discrimination, it would be unconstitutional.

3. **Options Analysis**:

   Let's look at each option:

   - **A: Hear the case on its merits.**
     - This suggests the court can proceed to decide the case. If the court has jurisdiction, it can hear it on the merits. But is there a reason to deny jurisdiction?

   - **B: Abstain from jurisdiction because it involves the operations of a commercial business.**
     - I don't think abstaining because it's a commercial business is a valid reason. Federal courts don't typically abstain just because a commercial operation is involved. They handle commercial cases all the time.

   - **C: Dismiss because the resident is not a citizen of the state.**
     - Wait, the plaintiff is a nonresident suing the state. But for diversity jurisdiction, the state isn't considered a citizen, and the plaintiff is a citizen of another state. However, the state is being sued, so diversity might not apply. Alternatively, the case could be under federal question. So this option might not be correct because the court can hear it based on the constitutional issue.

   - **D: Dismiss because it's a question of state law.**
     - No, because the challenge is constitutional. It's about whether the state law violates the U.S. Constitution, so it's a federal question.

   - **E: Hear the case but uphold the statute as it's within state's rights.**
     - The court might hear it, but whether they uphold it depends on the merits. The question is about jurisdiction, not the outcome. So this option is about the outcome, not whether the court can hear it.

   - **F: Hear the case because it involves Equal Protection.**
     - This is correct in terms of jurisdiction. The case raises a federal constitutional issue, so the court can hear it. The question is whether the fee violates Equal Protection.

   - **G: Dismiss because the resident lacks standing.**
     - Standing requires that the plaintiff has suffered an injury in fact, is concrete and particularized, and is causation and redressability. The plaintiff was denied a license because he didn't pay the fee. So he has standing because he was directly affected by the statute.

   - **H: Dismiss because state remedies not exhausted.**
     - Not applicable here. Federal courts don't require exhaustion of state remedies when the case is about a constitutional issue. The plaintiff can bring a federal claim without going through state courts first.

   - **I: Abstain because the constitutional issue should first be litigated in state court.**
     - The Supreme Court has held that federal courts should not abstain simply because a state law question is involved when there's a substantial federal issue. This is the idea behind the "federal common law" and the importance of resolving constitutional issues in federal courts. So I think this is incorrect.

   - **J: Dismiss because federal court lacks jurisdiction over state legislature decisions.**
     - No, because the issue is about the constitutionality of the state's action, which is within federal jurisdiction. The court can review state laws for constitutional compliance.

4. **Conclusion**: The federal court has jurisdiction because the case presents a federal constitutional question (Equal Protection). The correct answer should be that the court hears the case because it involves a potential violation of the Equal Protection Clause. So the answer is F.

The federal court has jurisdiction based on the constitutional issue raised, specifically the Equal Protection Clause. The correct answer is F.
