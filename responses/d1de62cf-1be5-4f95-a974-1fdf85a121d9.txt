Question:

One evening, a defendant set fire to an occupied house. As a result of the blaze, the homeowner's daughter was killed. The defendant was charged with felony murder on the first count and arson on the second count of the two-count indictment. The jury found the defendant guilty on the first count, but returned a not guilty verdict on the second count. The defendant's attorney's motion to set aside the guilty verdict on the felony murder charge will be

Options:

A: denied, because the jury's decision in a criminal trial is final.
B: denied, because the verdicts do not amount to a reversible error.
C: denied, because the defendant can be found guilty of felony murder without being found guilty of arson.
D: granted, because the verdicts are contradictory and thus nullify each other.
E: denied, because the felony murder charge stands independent of the arson charge.
F: granted, because the guilty verdict is plain error that adversely affects the defendant's constitutional rights.
G: granted, because the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to an acquittal of both charges.
H: granted, because the defendant was not proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
I: granted, as the defendant's attorney presented new evidence that could potentially change the verdict.
J: denied, because the defendant's proper remedy is to seek an appellate review for a non-constitutional error.

Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically dealing with felony murder and arson charges. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the scenario: A defendant is charged with two counts. The first count is felony murder, and the second is arson. The jury found him guilty on the first count but acquitted him on the second. The defendant's attorney is moving to set aside the guilty verdict on the felony murder charge. The question is whether this motion should be granted or denied, and why.

I remember that felony murder is a type of murder where the death occurs during the commission of another felony. The classic example is a robbery that results in someone's death. The underlying felony has to be an inherently dangerous one, which arson definitely is because setting a fire can endanger lives.

So, the defendant was found guilty of felony murder but not guilty of arson. Now, I'm thinking about how these charges relate. Felony murder typically requires the underlying felony, like arson, to be an independent felony. But wait, in some jurisdictions, felony murder can be a separate charge from the underlying felony. I think in this case, the charges are separate counts, so the jury could have found him guilty of felony murder without necessarily finding him guilty of the underlying felony, which in this case is arson.

I'm trying to remember: If someone is convicted of felony murder, does the underlying felony have to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt as well? Or can the felony murder conviction stand even if the defendant isn't convicted of the felony? I believe it's the latter. The felony murder charge is about the unlawful killing during the commission of a felony, so if the felony itself isn't proven, maybe the felony murder could be affected. But wait, in this case, the defendant was acquitted of arson, which is the felony here. So does that mean the felony murder charge can't stand?

Wait, but I think in some jurisdictions, the felony murder is considered a separate charge. So even if the defendant isn't guilty of arson, if the arson was the felony that led to the murder, then maybe the felony murder could still stand. But I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, if the jury acquitted him of arson, does that mean they found that he didn't commit the arson, which was the underlying felony for the felony murder? If so, then the felony murder charge might not hold because the necessary element (the underlying felony) wasn't proven. But I'm not entirely sure. I think it depends on whether the same actus reus is being considered for both charges.

Wait, in this case, the defendant set fire to the house, causing the death. So the act of arson is the felony, and the murder occurred during that felony. If the jury acquitted him of arson, that implies they found that he didn't commit the act of setting the fire, which would negate the underlying felony. So if the felony isn't proven, then the felony murder charge shouldn't stand because it requires the commission of the felony.

But I'm not certain. I think in some cases, the felony murder can be a separate charge, but maybe not if the underlying felony isn't proven. Alternatively, perhaps the jury's verdicts are inconsistent because he can't be guilty of felony murder without the underlying felony. So the verdicts are contradictory.

Looking at the options:

Option C says the motion is denied because the defendant can be found guilty of felony murder without being found guilty of arson. That would support the idea that the two charges are independent, so the acquittal on arson doesn't affect the felony murder.

Option E says the motion is denied because the felony murder charge stands independent of the arson charge. That seems similar to C but more direct.

Option D says the motion is granted because the verdicts are contradictory and thus nullify each other. If the jury found him guilty of felony murder but not arson, that might be inconsistent because felony murder usually requires the underlying felony. So the verdicts are conflicting.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the charges are considered together or separately. If the jury found him guilty of felony murder, which is a separate charge, then maybe the verdicts don't contradict. Alternatively, if the underlying felony is necessary, then the verdicts contradict.

I think in some jurisdictions, the felony murder is considered a separate charge, so the acquittal on the underlying felony doesn't necessarily nullify the felony murder conviction. But I'm not entirely sure.

Another angle: if the jury found him guilty of felony murder, that requires proving that he committed the felony (arson) and that during that felony, a death occurred. If the jury acquitted him of arson, that suggests they didn't find that he committed the arson, which would mean the felony murder charge shouldn't stand because the underlying felony wasn't proven.

So in that case, the verdicts are contradictory because he can't be guilty of felony murder without being guilty of the underlying felony. Therefore, the motion to set aside the guilty verdict should be granted because the verdicts are contradictory and thus nullify each other. That would point to option D.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes the felony murder can be based on a different felony than the one charged. But in this case, the second count is arson, so the felony murder is based on that same act. So if the jury acquitted him of arson, they're saying he didn't commit that act, which is the felony, so the felony murder can't stand.

Therefore, the verdicts are inconsistent because he can't be guilty of felony murder without being guilty of the underlying felony. So the motion should be granted, which is option D.

Alternatively, maybe the charges are considered separate, so the acquittal on arson doesn't affect felony murder. But I think the underlying felony is an essential element of felony murder, so the verdicts being in conflict would require the felony murder charge to be set aside.

So, I'm leaning towards option D, but I'm a bit uncertain because I might be mixing up the rules from different jurisdictions. Another thought: in some places, if the jury acquits on the underlying felony, it's an acquittal on all charges based on that act, so felony murder would fall. But in other places, they treat them as separate, so the acquittal on one doesn't affect the other.

Wait, but the charge of felony murder is based on the act of arson. So if the jury said he didn't commit arson, then the felony murder can't stand because the felony wasn't committed. Therefore, the verdicts are contradictory because you can't have felony murder without the felony.

So the correct answer is that the verdicts are contradictory, and the motion should be granted. That's option D.

Wait, but looking again, option E says the motion is denied because the felony murder charge stands independent. So if the charges are considered separate, then the acquittal on arson doesn't affect the felony murder. So which is it?

I think the answer depends on whether the underlying felony is an essential element of the felony murder charge. If the jury acquitted the defendant of arson, which is the felony, then the felony murder can't stand because the felony wasn't proven. So the verdicts are inconsistent, and the motion should be granted.

Therefore, the answer is D.

The defendant was charged with felony murder and arson. The jury acquitted him of arson but convicted him of felony murder. Felony murder typically requires the commission of an underlying felony, which in this case is arson. Since the jury acquitted the defendant of arson, they effectively found that the underlying felony was not committed. Felony murder cannot stand without the underlying felony, making the verdicts contradictory. Therefore, the motion to set aside the guilty verdict on the felony murder charge should be granted because the verdicts nullify each other.

Answer: D
