Question:

In 1981, a devoted conservationist, was the owner of a 100-acre tract of undeveloped land. In that year, the conservationist conveyed the tract "to my nephew in fee simple, provided, however, that the grantee agrees that neither he nor his heirs or assigns shall ever use the property for any commercial purpose. If any portion of said tract is used for other than residential purposes, then the grantor or his successors in interest may re-enter as of the grantor's former estate. " This deed was properly recorded. The nephew died intestate in 1999, survived by his wife. The conservationist died in 2002, survived by his two daughters, his only heirs. During the period between 1981 and 2007, the spreading development from a nearby city began to engulf the tract. Though still undeveloped, the tract became surrounded by office buildings, shopping malls, and other commercial edifices. In 2009, the wife executed and delivered to a developer a fee simple conveyance of the tract, which the developer immediately recorded. The deed did not contain any reference to the restriction noted above. After the developer acquired title to the tract, he commenced construction of a hotel complex on a portion of the tract that bordered an apartment building. The applicable recording statute in effect in this jurisdiction provides, in part, "No deed or other instrument in writing, not recorded in accordance with this statute, shall affect the title or rights to, in any real estate, or any devisee or purchaser in good faith, without knowledge of the existence of such unrecorded instruments. "If one of the daughters brings suit to enjoin the developer from constructing the hotel, the plaintiff will most likely

Options:

A: lose, because the developer was a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of the restriction.
B: win, because either daughter has the right of re-entry for condition broken.
C: win, because the restriction on commercial use was recorded and thus the developer should have been aware of it.
D: lose, because a common development scheme had been established for the entire tract.
E: win, because either daughter's right to the tract vested immediately upon the developer's construction of the hotel complex.
F: lose, because the restriction was not included in the deed from the wife to the developer.
G: lose, because the wife had the right to sell the property without any restrictions.
H: win, because the developer violated the deed's prohibition against commercial use.
I: win, because the daughters, as the conservationist's only heirs, received a valid possibility of reverter from their father.
J: lose, because the restriction on the use of the property is unenforceable.

Okay, so I've got this law question here about property law, specifically dealing with deeds, restrictions, and who has the right to enforce them. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's go through the facts. There's a conservationist who owned a 100-acre tract of land. In 1981, he conveyed this land to his nephew in fee simple, but with a condition. The condition is that the nephew (and his heirs or assigns) can't use the property for any commercial purpose. If they do use any part of the tract for something other than residential, the grantor (the conservationist) or his successors can re-enter and reclaim the property. The deed was properly recorded, which is important because recording affects who has notice of the restrictions.

Then, the nephew dies intestate in 1999, survived by his wife. The conservationist dies in 2002, survived by his two daughters, who are his only heirs. So, from 1981 to 2007, the land remains undeveloped but becomes surrounded by commercial buildings. In 2009, the nephew's wife (the developer's wife?) conveys the tract to a developer with a fee simple deed, which she records. The new deed doesn't mention the restriction. The developer starts building a hotel, which is a commercial use, right?

The question is whether the daughter can sue to enjoin the developer from building the hotel. The options are A through J, each with different legal theories.

I need to figure out who has the right to enforce the restriction. The original deed had a condition that if the property is used for anything other than residential, the grantor or his successors can re-enter. The grantor here is the conservationist, and his successors would be his heirs, which are his two daughters, since he died intestate in 2002.

Now, when the nephew died in 1999, the property went to his wife as his intestate heir because they didn't have any children. Wait, no, the nephew died intestate, so his wife would inherit as his heir. But then the conservationist died in 2002. Hmm, wait, the nephew conveyed the property to the developer, but the conservationist's daughters are his heirs. So, the chain of ownership is a bit tangled.

Wait, no. The conservationist conveyed the land to his nephew in 1981. The nephew then dies in 1999, intestate, so the property goes to his wife. Then in 2009, the wife conveys the property to the developer. So the developer is the current owner. But the original restriction was put on the nephew, so when the nephew died, the ownership passed to his wife, but the restriction would still apply to the property because it's a covenant running with the land.

But wait, the restriction is a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, which creates a possibility of reverter in the grantor (the conservationist) and his heirs. So when the conservationist died in 2002, his daughters would inherit this possibility of reverter. So if the condition is breached (commercial use), the daughters can re-enter.

But the developer didn't know about the restriction because the deed from the wife didn't mention it. However, the original restriction was recorded in 1981, so it's on the public records. The recording statute says that unrecorded instruments don't affect the title of a bona fide purchaser without notice.

So the developer is a bona fide purchaser if he took the property without notice of the restriction. But wait, if the restriction was properly recorded, then the developer should have known about it if he checked the records. So whether he had constructive notice depends on whether the recording was done properly.

The original deed was recorded, so under the recording statute, if the developer took the property without knowledge of the restriction and without notice (actual or constructive), he might be a bona fide purchaser. But if the restriction was recorded, then the developer is chargeable with notice if he didn't check the records. Wait, no, a bona fide purchaser is someone who takes without notice and without knowledge, but if the instrument was recorded, they are charged with constructive notice.

So in this case, the developer's deed didn't mention the restriction, but the original restriction was recorded. So when the developer took the property, they are considered to have constructive notice of the restriction because it was in the public records. Therefore, the developer is not a bona fide purchaser for value without notice because they should have known about the restriction.

Wait, but the recording statute says that unrecorded instruments don't affect the title of a purchaser in good faith without knowledge. So if the instrument (restriction) was recorded, then it would affect the title, meaning the developer is on notice. So the developer can't claim bona fide purchaser status because they should have known about it.

Alternatively, if the restriction was not in the chain of title, maybe? Wait, the original deed was from the conservationist to the nephew, which was recorded. The nephew's wife conveyed it to the developer. So the developer's chain of title would go back to the nephew, and then the original deed would be in the records. So the developer's title search would have found the original deed with the restriction. Therefore, the developer had constructive notice.

Thus, the developer can't be a bona fide purchaser because they had constructive notice. Therefore, the restriction is enforceable against them.

So the daughters, as the conservationist's heirs, have the right to enforce the restriction. When the developer starts using the land commercially, they can exercise the right of re-entry and enjoin the developer.

Looking at the options:

A: lose, because developer is BFP. But no, because he had constructive notice.

B: win, because either daughter has the right of re-entry. This seems correct.

C: win, because the restriction was recorded, so developer should have been aware. But this is more about notice, which is part of why the restriction is enforceable.

H: win, because the developer violated the deed's prohibition. But the issue is whether the daughters can enforce it.

I: win, because daughters have a possibility of reverter. That's accurate too, because the restriction creates a possibility of reverter in the grantor and his heirs.

So between B, C, H, and I.

Wait, the original deed was a fee simple with a condition subsequent. That creates a possibility of reverter in the grantor. The grantor died, so his heirs (the daughters) inherit that possibility of reverter. So when the condition is breached (commercial use), they can re-enter.

So the daughters can sue to enjoin the developer. So the correct answer would be B or I.

Option B says "win, because either daughter has the right of re-entry for condition broken."

Option I says "win, because the daughters... received a valid possibility of reverter."

Both seem correct, but let's check the options.

Wait, the possibility of reverter is a future interest in the grantor. When the grantor dies, that future interest would pass to his heirs. So the daughters have the right to enforce the condition.

So the correct answer would be I? Or B? Because B says "right of re-entry," which is a present possessory right, but I says "possibility of reverter."

Wait, in a fee simple determinable or subject to condition subsequent, the future interest is a possibility of reverter. So when the condition is broken, the holder of the possibility of reverter (the daughters) can re-enter and reclaim the property.

So the daughters can sue to enjoin the developer because they have the right of re-entry upon the breach.

Looking at the options, B says the daughters have the right of re-entry. I says they have a possibility of reverter.

But the right to enforce the condition is the right of re-entry, which is the present right to take back the property upon breach.

So B and I both touch on this. But the way the options are phrased, B is about the right of re-entry, which is the immediate right upon breach, while I is about the possibility of reverter, which is the future interest.

I think the correct answer would be B or I. Wait, let me think again.

The original deed was "fee simple, provided that..." which is a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. This creates a possibility of reverter in the grantor. When the grantor dies, the possibility of reverter passes to his heirs, the daughters.

When the condition is breached (commercial use), the holder of the possibility of reverter (daughters) can exercise their right of re-entry. So both concepts are connected.

So the answer could be either B or I. Looking at the options, I think B is more about the right of re-entry upon the condition being broken, which is the immediate cause of action.

Alternatively, I is about the possibility of reverter, which is the future interest.

Wait, the question is whether the daughters can enjoin the developer. The right to enjoin would stem from their right of re-entry upon the breach, which is the present right. So B would be the correct answer.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me check the options again.

Option B: "...either daughter has the right of re-entry for condition broken."

Option I: "...daughters... received a valid possibility of reverter from their father."

So both are correct in a way, but the more precise answer is B because it directly addresses the right to re-enter upon the condition being broken.

Wait, but the right of re-entry is what allows the holder to take back the property. The possibility of reverter is the future interest that allows that right upon breach.

So perhaps the correct answer is I, because the daughters have the possibility of reverter, which gives them the right to enforce the condition.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B, as it directly states the right of re-entry.

Wait, but the right of re-entry is the legal remedy when the condition is breached. So the daughters can exercise their right of re-entry, which is the right to take back the property.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Alternatively, I might be correct because the possibility of reverter is what gives them the right to enforce.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me think of it another way.

In a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, the grantor retains a right of re-entry. When the grantor dies, this right passes to his heirs. So the daughters have the right of re-entry upon a breach.

So option B is correct because it states that either daughter has the right of re-entry for the condition broken.

Therefore, the answer should be B.
</think>

The conservationist conveyed the land to his nephew with a condition that it could not be used commercially, creating a possibility of reverter in the grantor and his heirs. The restriction was recorded, providing constructive notice to subsequent purchasers. The nephew died intestate, and the property passed to his wife, who later sold it to the developer. The developer, however, had constructive notice of the restriction through the recorded deed. The conservationist's daughters inherited the possibility of reverter upon his death. When the developer began a commercial use, the daughters could enforce the restriction through their right of re-entry. Therefore, the daughters are likely to win.

Answer: B
