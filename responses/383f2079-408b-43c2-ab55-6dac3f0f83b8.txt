Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because balancing equations isn't my strongest suit. But I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the problem says.

There are three parts to the question: (a), (b), and (c). Each part is a chemical equation that needs to be balanced by filling in the missing species and putting the correct coefficients. The options provided are A through J, each giving possible answers for the blanks in all three parts. So, I'll need to tackle each part one by one.

Starting with part (a): NaOH + _____ → NaHSO4 + HOH. Hmm, I recognize HOH as H2O, which is water. So the products are NaHSO4 and H2O. The reactants are NaOH and something else. I need to find what's missing.

First, let's list the elements on both sides. On the product side, NaHSO4 has Na, H, S, O4. H2O has H and O. Let's count each element.

Reactant side: NaOH has Na, O, H. The other reactant is the missing species, which I'll call X. Product side: NaHSO4 has Na:1, H:1, S:1, O:4. H2O: H:2, O:1.

So, let's count each element in the products:

Na: 1 (from NaHSO4)
H: 1 (NaHSO4) + 2 (H2O) = 3
S: 1
O: 4 (NaHSO4) + 1 (H2O) = 5
Cl: 0

Reactant side: NaOH has Na:1, O:1, H:1. The other reactant X must supply the remaining elements.

Looking at Na: 1 on both sides, so that's balanced if only NaOH and X are present. Now for O: on reactant side, we have O from NaOH (1) plus O from X. On product side, O is 5. So X must contribute 4 O atoms. Similarly, H on reactant side: H from NaOH (1) plus H from X. Product side has H:3. So X must contribute 2 H atoms.

Wait, looking at S: on product side, there's 1 S in NaHSO4. So X must supply S. So X must be a sulfur-containing compound. Also, looking at the reaction, perhaps sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is involved? Because NaOH reacting with H2SO4 would produce NaHSO4 and water. Let me check the reaction:

NaOH + H2SO4 → NaHSO4 + H2O

Wait, but let's count the atoms on each side. NaOH: Na=1, O=1, H=1. H2SO4: H=2, S=1, O=4. Products: NaHSO4 (Na=1, H=1, S=1, O=4) and H2O (H=2, O=1). 

So for Na: 1 on each side. S: 1 on each. O: NaOH contributes 1, H2SO4 contributes 4 → total O=5. Products: NaHSO4 has 4 O, H2O has 1 → total O=5. H: NaOH has 1, H2SO4 has 2 → total 3 H. Products: NaHSO4 has 1 H, H2O has 2 → total 3 H. So it balances. So the missing species is H2SO4. So for part (a), the blank is H2SO4.

Now, moving to part (b): PCI3 + __ HOH → ___ + 3HCl. Hmm. Let's parse this. Reactants are PCI3 and HOH (which is H2O). Products are something and 3 HCl.

I think this is a hydrolysis reaction where PCI3 reacts with water. Let me think about what products form. Phosphorus trichloride (PCl3) reacting with water would hydrolyze to produce phosphoric acid (H3PO4) and HCl, perhaps. Let me check the reaction.

The general reaction for PCl3 + H2O → H3PO4 + HCl.

Let me write the equation: PCl3 + H2O → H3PO4 + HCl.

Now, let's balance it. Let's count each element.

PCl3: P=1, Cl=3, C=0, H=0, O=0.

H2O: H=2, O=1.

Products: H3PO4 has P=1, H=3, O=4. HCl has H=1, Cl=1.

So the products are H3PO4 and HCl, with 3 HCl. So the equation would be PCl3 + H2O → H3PO4 + 3 HCl.

Wait, but let me check the coefficients. Let's balance each element.

Start with P: 1 on each side. Good.

Cl: PCl3 has 3 Cl. On product side, 3 HCl → 3 Cl. So that's balanced.

O: On reactant side, H2O has 1 O. On product side, H3PO4 has 4 O. So total O needs to be 4. So perhaps we need more H2O.

Wait, perhaps the equation is PCl3 + H2O → H3PO4 + 3 HCl.

Let me count:

Left: P=1, Cl=3, H=2 (from H2O) + 3*H (from HCl) → Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me approach it systematically.

Let me write the unbalanced equation:

PCl3 + H2O → H3PO4 + HCl.

Now, let's balance each element.

P: 1 on each side.

Cl: 3 on left (PCl3) → 1 on right (HCl). So need 3 HCl on the right. So 3 HCl.

Now, Cl is balanced: 3 on each side.

O: H2O has 1 O. H3PO4 has 4 O. So total O on right is 4. So we need 4 H2O on the left to provide 4 O. So 4 H2O → 4 O.

Wait, let's try that.

So now, equation is:

PCl3 + 4 H2O → H3PO4 + 3 HCl.

Now, check H: Left side: 4 H2O → 8 H. Right side: H3PO4 has 3 H, 3 HCl has 3 H → total 6 H. So 8 H on left, 6 on right. Not balanced. So perhaps adding more HCl.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me try another approach.

Let me write the equation again: PCl3 + H2O → H3PO4 + HCl.

Now, balance Cl first. PCl3 has 3 Cl; each HCl has 1 Cl. So we need 3 HCl. So equation becomes:

PCl3 + H2O → H3PO4 + 3 HCl.

Now, balance O: H2O has 1 O, H3PO4 has 4 O. So total O on right is 4. So need 4 H2O on left. So:

PCl3 + 4 H2O → H3PO4 + 3 HCl.

Now, check H: On left, 4 H2O → 8 H. On right: H3PO4 has 3 H, 3 HCl has 3 H → total 6 H. So 8 H on left, 6 on right. Not balanced. So I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should balance H after O. Let's see.

In PCl3 + 4 H2O → H3PO4 + 3 HCl.

H on left: 4 H2O → 8 H.

H on right: H3PO4 (3 H) + 3 HCl (3 H) = 6 H. So difference of 2 H. So maybe I need 2 more HCl on the right, making it 5 HCl. But that would make Cl unbalanced.

Alternatively, perhaps I should adjust the number of H2O.

Wait, maybe the correct equation is PCl3 + 4 H2O → H3PO4 + 3 HCl + H2O? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, maybe the correct product isn't H3PO4 but HPO3 or something else. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is different.

Wait, another thought: maybe the products are H3PO4 and HCl. Let's try balancing again.

PCl3 + H2O → H3PO4 + HCl.

Now, P: 1 on each side.

Cl: 3 on left (PCl3) → 1 on right (HCl). So need 3 HCl on the right. So equation is PCl3 + H2O → H3PO4 + 3 HCl.

Now, O: H2O has 1 O. H3PO4 has 4 O. So total O on right is 4. So need 4 H2O on left. So:

PCl3 + 4 H2O → H3PO4 + 3 HCl.

Now, H on left: 4 H2O → 8 H.

H on right: H3PO4 (3) + 3 HCl (3) → 6 H. So 8 H on left, 6 on right. To balance H, perhaps add another HCl, making it 4 HCl. But then Cl would be 3 on left (PCl3) and 4 on right. Not balanced.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the product is HPO3 instead of H3PO4.

Wait, let me think again. The reaction of PCl3 with water is known to produce H3PO4 and HCl. The balanced equation is:

PCl3 + 4 H2O → H3PO4 + 3 HCl + H2O? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

PCl3 + 4 H2O → H3PO4 + 3 HCl + H3O^+? No, that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for the correct balanced equation. From what I recall, the balanced equation is:

PCl3 + 4 H2O → H3PO4 + 3 HCl + H3O^+ → but that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

PCl3 + 4 H2O → H3PO4 + 3 HCl + 2 H2O. Wait, that can't be right because you can't have H2O on both sides. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct equation is:

PCl3 + 4 H2O → H3PO4 + 3 HCl.

But then H isn't balanced. Let's count again.

Left: 4 H2O → 8 H.

Right: H3PO4 has 3 H, 3 HCl has 3 H → total 6 H. So 8 H on left, 6 on right. So we're missing 2 H on the right. Maybe we need 2 more HCl, but that would give 5 HCl, which would mean 5 Cl on the right, but PCl3 only has 3 Cl. So that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the missing species is H3PO4 and the coefficient for H2O is 4. So for part (b), the blanks are H2O with a coefficient of 4, and the product is H3PO4.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see. Looking at the options for part (b), the options are:

Looking at the options, for part (b), the missing species is the first blank, and the product is the second blank. So the question is PCI3 + ___ HOH → ___ + 3HCl.

So, the reaction is PCI3 + n H2O → m ??? + 3 HCl.

So, the product is ??? which we're assuming is H3PO4. So the equation would be PCl3 + 4 H2O → H3PO4 + 3 HCl.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me try balancing again.

PCl3 + H2O → H3PO4 + HCl.

Let me balance Cl first: 3 on left, 1 on right → need 3 HCl on right.

So equation: PCl3 + H2O → H3PO4 + 3 HCl.

Now, O: H2O has 1 O. H3PO4 has 4 O → so need 4 H2O on left.

So: PCl3 + 4 H2O → H3PO4 + 3 HCl.

Now, H: Left → 4*2=8 H. Right → H3PO4 has 3 H, 3 HCl has 3 H → total 6 H. So 8 H on left, 6 on right. To balance, perhaps add 2 HCl, but that would make Cl unbalanced.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to consider that H3PO4 has 3 H, and the HCl has 3 H, so total 6 H. But on the left, we have 4 H2O → 8 H. So to balance H, perhaps I need to have 4 HCl on the right, making H from HCl=4, plus H3PO4's 3 → 7 H. Not matching 8. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing H somewhere else. Alternatively, perhaps the product is HPO3 instead of H3PO4.

Wait, if the product is HPO3, let's try that.

PCl3 + H2O → HPO3 + HCl.

Now, Cl: 3 on left → 1 on right → need 3 HCl.

So equation: PCl3 + H2O → HPO3 + 3 HCl.

Now, O: H2O has 1 O, HPO3 has 3 O → total 4 O on right. So need 4 H2O on left.

So: PCl3 + 4 H2O → HPO3 + 3 HCl.

Now, H: Left → 4 H2O → 8 H. Right: HPO3 has 1 H, 3 HCl has 3 H → total 4 H. So 8 H on left, 4 on right. Not balanced.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look at the options provided for part (b). Let me check the options again.

The options are A through J. For part (b), the options provided in the answer choices are:

Looking at the options, each option gives the missing species for (a), (b), and (c). So for part (b), the options are the second blank in each option.

Wait, no, each option lists the answers for (a), (b), (c). For example, option A says (a) H2SO4, (b) P(OH)3, (c) 2 Cl2.

Wait, no, I think each option is a set of answers for each part. So perhaps I should look at each option and see which one fits all three parts correctly.

But let's proceed. For part (b), looking for the missing species (the first blank) and the product (the second blank). The reaction is PCl3 + __ H2O → __ + 3 HCl.

So, the product must be H3PO4 because PCl3 reacting with water typically produces phosphoric acid and HCl. So the equation would be PCl3 + 4 H2O → H3PO4 + 3 HCl.

Wait, but earlier I couldn't balance H. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me recount.

In the equation PCl3 + 4 H2O → H3PO4 + 3 HCl.

Left: P=1, Cl=3, H=8 (4 H2O → 4×2=8), O=4.

Right: H3PO4 has P=1, H=3, O=4; HCl has H=3, Cl=3.

So H on right: 3 (H3PO4) + 3 (HCl) = 6 H. Left has 8 H. So 8 vs 6 H. To balance, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe I need to add another H2O on the right, but that's not part of the reaction as written.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct product is HPO3 instead of H3PO4, but that didn't balance earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should accept that the equation isn't perfectly balanced and proceed, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product is H3PO3 or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces HPO3 and some HCl, but I'm not getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is H3PO4 and HCl, and I need to adjust the coefficients. Let's try another approach.

Let me write the equation as:

PCl3 + H2O → H3PO4 + HCl.

Now, let's balance each element step by step.

P: 1 on each side.

Cl: 3 on left → 1 on right. So need 3 HCl on the right.

So equation becomes:

PCl3 + H2O → H3PO4 + 3 HCl.

Now, O: H2O has 1 O, H3PO4 has 4 O → total 4 O on right. So need 4 H2O on left.

So equation:

PCl3 + 4 H2O → H3PO4 + 3 HCl.

Now, H: Left has 4×2=8 H. Right: H3PO4 has 3 H, 3 HCl has 3 H → total 6 H. So 8 H on left, 6 on right. To balance, perhaps add 2 more HCl, but that would make Cl unbalanced.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing H somewhere else. Alternatively, perhaps the equation can't be balanced without another product, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that H3PO4 is formed with additional H. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating and the correct answer is that the missing species is H3PO4, and the coefficient for H2O is 4. So for part (b), the blanks are 4 H2O and H3PO4.

Looking at the options, let's see which option has H3PO4 as the product for part (b). Looking at the options, option F says for (b), the product is H3PO4. Option E: (b) P(OH)3 as the product? Wait, no, each option lists the answers for all three parts.

Wait, the options are:

Options:

A: H2SO4, P(OH)3, 2 Cl2

B: H2SO3, P(OH)3, 3 Cl2

C: HClO4, P(OH)3, 5 Cl2

D: H2SO4, P(OH)4, 2 Cl2

E: H2SO4, P(OH)3, 4 Cl2

F: H2SO4, H3PO4, Cl2

G: H2SO4, PCl3, Cl2

H: H2O2, P(OH)3, 4 Cl2

I: H2SO4, P(OH)2, 3 Cl2

J: H2O, P(OH)3, Cl2

So for part (b), the product should be H3PO4. Looking at the options, option F says for (b) the product is H3PO4. So the answer for part (b) in option F is H3PO4, and the missing species is H2O with a coefficient. Wait, but in the question, part (b) is PCI3 + __ HOH → __ + 3HCl. So the blank is the coefficient for HOH, which is H2O.

If the equation is PCl3 + 4 H2O → H3PO4 + 3 HCl, then the coefficient for HOH (H2O) is 4, and the product is H3PO4.

Looking at option F: for (b), the product is H3PO4, but the missing species (the first blank in part (b)) would be 4 H2O. But option F doesn't specify the coefficients; it just gives the species. Wait, the options are giving the missing species, not the coefficients. Wait, no, the question is to fill in the missing species and the proper coefficients. So each option provides the missing species for each part.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The options are giving the missing species and the coefficients for each part as a set. So for each part, the option provides the missing species and any coefficients needed.

Wait, looking again at the problem statement:

"Balance the following by filling in missing species and proper coefficient: (a) NaOH + _____\rightarrow NaHSO_4 + HOH; (b)PCI_3 +__ HOH \rightarrow _____ + 3HCl, (c) CH_4 + ____ \rightarrowCCl_4 + 4HCl."

So for each part, the blanks are either the missing species or coefficients. So for part (a), the blank is the missing species, which is H2SO4. For part (b), the first blank is the coefficient for HOH (H2O), and the second blank is the product. For part (c), the blank is the missing species.

So for option F, which says (b) H3PO4, that would mean the product is H3PO4, and the missing species (the first blank in part (b)) would be the coefficient for H2O, which we determined is 4. But looking at option F, the part (b) answer is H3PO4, which is the product. So the coefficient for H2O would be 4, but option F doesn't specify the coefficients, only the species. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe the correct option is F, where for part (b), the product is H3PO4, and the coefficient for H2O is 4. So the option F would have the first blank in (b) as 4 H2O, but the option only lists the product as H3PO4. So perhaps the correct option is F, but I'm not entirely sure.

Moving on to part (c): CH4 + ____ → CCl4 + 4 HCl.

This looks like a substitution reaction where CH4 is reacting with chlorine (probably Cl2) under certain conditions to form CCl4 and HCl. The reaction is likely CH4 + 4 Cl2 → CCl4 + 4 HCl.

Wait, but let me check the stoichiometry. Methane (CH4) reacting with chlorine gas (Cl2) to produce carbon tetrafluoride (CCl4) and HCl. The balanced equation would be CH4 + 4 Cl2 → CCl4 + 4 HCl.

So the missing species is Cl2 with a coefficient of 4. Alternatively, perhaps it's 2 Cl2, but let me check.

Wait, the reaction is CH4 + Cl2 → CCl4 + HCl.

To balance, let's start with C: 1 on each side.

H: 4 on CH4 → 4 on HCl (since 4 HCl has 4 H). So that's balanced.

Cl: CH4 has 0 Cl. Cl2 has 2 Cl per molecule. So on the product side, CCl4 has 4 Cl, and 4 HCl has 4 Cl → total 8 Cl. So on the reactant side, we need 4 Cl2 molecules (each with 2 Cl atoms) → 4×2=8 Cl atoms.

So the balanced equation is CH4 + 4 Cl2 → CCl4 + 4 HCl.

Thus, the missing species is Cl2 with a coefficient of 4.

Now, looking at the options, for part (c), the missing species is Cl2 with coefficient 4. Let's see which options have that.

Looking at the options:

A: 2 Cl2

B: 3 Cl2

C:5 Cl2

D:2 Cl2

E:4 Cl2

F:Cl2 (but no coefficient specified, but in the reaction, it's 4)

G:Cl2 (but no coefficient)

H:4 Cl2

I:3 Cl2

J:Cl2

So option E has part (c) as 4 Cl2, which matches. Option H also has part (c) as 4 Cl2.

Now, let's tie this all together. We have to find an option that correctly answers all three parts.

From part (a), the missing species is H2SO4. Looking at the options, which ones have H2SO4 for part (a):

A: H2SO4

B: H2SO3

C: HClO4

D: H2SO4

E: H2SO4

F: H2SO4

G: H2SO4

H: H2O2

I: H2SO4

J: H2O

So options A, D, E, F, G, I have H2SO4 for part (a).

From part (b), the product is H3PO4, which is in option F and option H? Wait, no, option F's part (b) is H3PO4, yes. Option H's part (b) is P(OH)3, which doesn't match.

From part (c), we need 4 Cl2, which is in options E and H.

So let's see which options match all three.

Option E: (a) H2SO4, (b) P(OH)3, (c)4 Cl2.

But earlier, for part (b), the product should be H3PO4, not P(OH)3. So option E's part (b) is incorrect.

Option F: (a) H2SO4, (b) H3PO4, (c) Cl2. But in part (c), the coefficient is 4, but option F doesn't specify the coefficient, just the species. So part (c) in F is Cl2, but without coefficient, which may not be correct.

Option H: (a) H2O2, which is incorrect because part (a) needs H2SO4.

Option I: (a) H2SO4, (b) P(OH)2, (c)3 Cl2. Part (b) product is P(OH)2, which doesn't match H3PO4.

Option D: (a) H2SO4, (b) P(OH)4, (c)2 Cl2. Part (b) product is P(OH)4, which doesn't match.

Option G: (a) H2SO4, (b) PCl3, (c) Cl2. Part (b) product is PCl3, which is incorrect because the product should be H3PO4.

Option A: (a) H2SO4, (b) P(OH)3, (c)2 Cl2. Part (b) product is P(OH)3, which doesn't match.

Option B: (a) H2SO3, which is incorrect.

Option C: (a) HClO4, which is incorrect.

Option J: (a) H2O, which is incorrect.

So the only option where part (a) is H2SO4, part (b) product is H3PO4, and part (c) is 4 Cl2 is option F, but option F's part (c) is Cl2 without coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, option F says for part (c) Cl2, but the correct coefficient is 4. So option F is incorrect for part (c).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in part (b). Let me re-examine part (b).

The reaction is PCl3 + H2O → H3PO4 + 3 HCl.

To balance, we found that 4 H2O are needed, making the equation:

PCl3 + 4 H2O → H3PO4 + 3 HCl.

So for part (b), the blanks are 4 H2O and H3PO4.

Looking at the options, which option has part (b) as 4 H2O (the first blank) and H3PO4 (the second blank)? Let's check:

Option F: (b) H3PO4. So the product is correct, but the first blank (the coefficient for HOH, which is H2O) is 4. But option F doesn't specify the coefficient, only the species. So perhaps the option is F, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the options are giving the missing species, not the coefficients. So for part (b), the first blank is the coefficient for H2O, which is 4, and the product is H3PO4. So the option must have part (b) as 4 H2O and H3PO4.

Looking at the options:

Option F: (b) product is H3PO4, but what's the first blank? The options list the missing species, so for part (b), the first blank would be the coefficient for H2O, which is 4. But looking at the options, each option lists the species, not the coefficients. So perhaps the options are structured differently.

Wait, perhaps the options are giving the missing species, and the coefficients are determined by the option letters. For example, option F says for part (b) the product is H3PO4, and the missing species is H2O with a coefficient of 4. But I'm not sure how the coefficients are represented in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the first blank in part (b) is P(OH)3. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the missing species is H3PO4, but that's the product.

I'm getting a bit stuck here, but let's proceed. From part (c), the missing species is Cl2 with coefficient 4. So the correct option must have part (c) as 4 Cl2. Only options E and H do that.

Option E: part (a) H2SO4, part (b) P(OH)3, part (c)4 Cl2.

But part (b) product is P(OH)3, which doesn't match H3PO4.

Option H: part (a) H2O2, which is incorrect.

So perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the reaction in part (b) is PCl3 + H2O → H3PO3 + HCl. Let me try that.

PCl3 + H2O → H3PO3 + HCl.

Balancing Cl: 3 on left, 1 on right → need 3 HCl.

So: PCl3 + H2O → H3PO3 + 3 HCl.

Now, O: H2O has 1 O, H3PO3 has 3 O → total 4 O on right. So need 4 H2O on left.

Equation: PCl3 + 4 H2O → H3PO3 + 3 HCl.

Now, H: Left → 4×2=8 H. Right → H3PO3 (3 H) + 3 HCl (3 H) → 6 H. So 8 vs 6. Still not balanced.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is HPO3.

Wait, perhaps the correct product is HPO3, but let me check.

PCl3 + H2O → HPO3 + HCl.

Cl: 3 on left → 1 on right → need 3 HCl.

Equation: PCl3 + H2O → HPO3 + 3 HCl.

O: H2O (1 O) → HPO3 (3 O). So need 3 H2O on left.

So: PCl3 + 3 H2O → HPO3 + 3 HCl.

Now, H: Left → 3×2=6 H. Right → HPO3 (1 H) + 3 HCl (3 H) → 4 H. Not balanced.

Hmm. I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should accept that the correct option is F, where part (b) product is H3PO4, and the coefficient for H2O is 4, even though I can't perfectly balance the equation. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me look back at the options. Option E says for part (b) the product is P(OH)3. That doesn't make sense because PCl3 reacting with water would produce H3PO4, not P(OH)3. So option E is incorrect for part (b).

Option F: (b) H3PO4. So part (b) product is correct, but what about the coefficient for H2O? It must be 4. So for part (b), the first blank is 4 H2O. So the option must have part (b)'s first blank as 4 H2O, but the options don't specify coefficients, only species. So perhaps option F is the correct choice, as it has the correct product for part (b), and for part (c), the missing species is Cl2 with coefficient 4, which is in option E and H. But since option F's part (c) is Cl2 without coefficient, perhaps it's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is E, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in part (a). Let me double-check part (a).

Part (a): NaOH + H2SO4 → NaHSO4 + H2O.

Yes, that's correct. So part (a) requires H2SO4 as the missing species.

Looking back at the options, option E has part (a) as H2SO4, part (b) as P(OH)3, which is incorrect, and part (c) as 4 Cl2.

So option E is incorrect for part (b).

Option F has part (a) correct, part (b) correct, but part (c) is Cl2 without coefficient. So perhaps option F is correct, assuming the coefficient is 4.

Wait, no, the option F's part (c) is Cl2, but the correct coefficient is 4. So the option should have 4 Cl2, which is in option E and H.

But option E's part (b) is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that for part (b), the product is P(OH)3. Let me think about that.

If the reaction is PCl3 + H2O → P(OH)3 + HCl.

Cl: 3 on left → 1 on right → need 3 HCl.

So equation: PCl3 + H2O → P(OH)3 + 3 HCl.

Now, O: H2O has 1 O → P(OH)3 has 3 O. So need 3 H2O on left.

Equation: PCl3 + 3 H2O → P(OH)3 + 3 HCl.

Now, H: Left → 3×2=6 H. Right → P(OH)3 has 3 H, 3 HCl has 3 H → total 6 H. So balanced.

So this equation balances. So for part (b), the product is P(OH)3, and the coefficient for H2O is 3.

Looking at the options, which option has part (b) product as P(OH)3 and part (a) as H2SO4, and part (c) as 4 Cl2.

Looking at the options:

Option A: (b) P(OH)3, (c)2 Cl2.

Option B: (b) P(OH)3, (c)3 Cl2.

Option E: (b) P(OH)3, (c)4 Cl2.

Option H: (b) P(OH)3, (c)4 Cl2.

So, part (b) product is P(OH)3. Part (a) is H2SO4.

So options A, B, E, H have part (a) as H2SO4 and part (b) as P(OH)3.

Now, for part (c), the correct coefficient is 4 Cl2. So option E and H have that.

So among these, option E and H have part (c) as 4 Cl2.

But option E's part (a) is H2SO4, part (b) P(OH)3, part (c)4 Cl2.

Option H's part (a) is H2O2, which is incorrect.

So option E is the only one that fits all three parts.

Wait, but earlier I thought part (b)'s product was H3PO4, but if the reaction produces P(OH)3, that changes things.

So, perhaps the correct reaction for part (b) is PCl3 + 3 H2O → P(OH)3 + 3 HCl.

That would mean the product is P(OH)3, and the coefficient for H2O is 3.

So, for part (b), the blanks would be 3 H2O and P(OH)3.

Looking at the options, option E has part (a) H2SO4, part (b) P(OH)3, part (c)4 Cl2.

So option E would be correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought the reaction produces H3PO4, but perhaps it's P(OH)3.

I think I need to clarify this. The reaction of PCl3 with water typically produces H3PO4 and HCl. But perhaps under certain conditions, it can produce P(OH)3 and HCl. Let me double-check.

Upon checking, the hydrolysis of PCl3 with water generally produces H3PO4 and HCl. The reaction is:

PCl3 + 4 H2O → H3PO4 + 3 HCl + H2O.

Wait, perhaps I was overcomplicating earlier. Alternatively, perhaps the correct product is H3PO4, and the coefficient for H2O is 4.

But according to the options, only option F has H3PO4 as the product in part (b), but it doesn't have the correct coefficient for part (c).

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E, where part (b) product is P(OH)3, part (a) is H2SO4, and part (c) is 4 Cl2.

So putting it all together:

(a) NaOH + H2SO4 → NaHSO4 + H2O.

(b) PCl3 + 3 H2O → P(OH)3 + 3 HCl.

(c) CH4 + 4 Cl2 → CCl4 + 4 HCl.

So the coefficients and species would be:

(a) H2SO4.

(b) 3 H2O and P(OH)3.

(c) 4 Cl2.

Looking at the options, option E has:

(a) H2SO4,

(b) P(OH)3,

(c)4 Cl2.

So option E is the correct answer.

The problem involves balancing three chemical equations by identifying missing species and coefficients. Here's the analysis for each part:

### Part (a):  
**Equation:** NaOH + _____ → NaHSO₄ + HOH  
- HOH is H₂O.  
- NaHSO₄ contains Na, H, S, and O.  
- NaOH provides Na, O, and H. The missing species must supply the remaining atoms.  
- H₂SO₄ reacts with NaOH to form NaHSO₄ and H₂O:  
  **NaOH + H₂SO₄ → NaHSO₄ + H₂O**  
- This balances all elements.  

**Conclusion for (a):** The missing species is **H₂SO₄**.

### Part (b):  
**Equation:** PCl₃ + __ HOH → _____ + 3HCl  
- HOH is H₂O.  
- PCl₃ reacts with water to form a phosphorus-containing compound and HCl.  
- The balanced reaction is:  
  **PCl₃ + 3H₂O → P(OH)₃ + 3HCl**  
- This balances all elements.  

**Conclusion for (b):** The missing species is **3 H₂O**, and the product is **P(OH)₃**.

---

### Part (c):  
**Equation:** CH₄ + _____ → CCl₄ + 4HCl  
- CH₄ reacts with chlorine gas (Cl₂) to form CCl₄ and HCl.  
- The balanced reaction is:  
  **CH₄ + 4Cl₂ → CCl₄ + 4HCl**  
- This balances all elements.  

**Conclusion for (c):** The missing species is **Cl₂** with a coefficient of **4**.

---

### Final Answer:  
From the analysis:  
- Part (a): H₂SO₄  
- Part (b): 3 H₂O and P(OH)₃  
- Part (c): 4 Cl₂  

The option that matches all three parts is **E**.  

**Answer:** E
