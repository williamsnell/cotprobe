Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is asking me to determine the scalar potential function of a given vector field. The vector field is A, which is written as A = 2xy î + x² ĵ + 3z² k̂. I need to find the scalar potential function, often denoted as φ, such that the gradient of φ equals A. 

Hmm, right, scalar potential functions are used when a vector field is conservative, meaning it's the gradient of some scalar function. So the first thing I need to do is check if the vector field A is conservative. For that, I remember that in three dimensions, a vector field is conservative if its curl is zero. But maybe I can also approach it by trying to find the potential function directly and see if it's possible.

Let me start by recalling how to find the scalar potential. The gradient of φ should equal A, so:

∇φ = A = 2xy î + x² ĵ + 3z² k̂

This gives me three partial differential equations:

1. ∂φ/∂x = 2xy
2. ∂φ/∂y = x²
3. ∂φ/∂z = 3z²

I'll try to integrate each component with respect to their variables and see if I can find a consistent φ.

Starting with the first equation: ∂φ/∂x = 2xy. Integrate both sides with respect to x.

∫ 2xy dx = 2 * (x²/2) y + C(y,z) = x² y + C(y,z)

Here, I treated y and z as constants because I'm integrating with respect to x. The constant of integration, C(y,z), can depend on y and z but not x since we've integrated with respect to x.

Now, moving to the second equation: ∂φ/∂y = x². I'll substitute the expression I found for φ from the first integration into this.

From the first part, φ = x² y + C(y,z). Taking the partial derivative with respect to y gives:

∂φ/∂y = x² + ∂C/∂y

But according to the second equation, ∂φ/∂y should equal x². So:

x² + ∂C/∂y = x² → ∂C/∂y = 0

This implies that C doesn't depend on y either. So C is a function of z alone, let's say C(z).

So now, φ = x² y + C(z)

Next, using the third equation: ∂φ/∂z = 3z². Substitute φ = x² y + C(z) into this.

∂φ/∂z = dC/dz = 3z²

Integrate this with respect to z:

∫ 3z² dz = z³ + D, where D is a constant of integration.

So, C(z) = z³ + D.

Putting it all together, φ = x² y + z³ + D.

Since the scalar potential is defined up to a constant, D can be absorbed into the constant of the potential function, often written as +C. So φ = x² y + z³ + C.

Looking at the options provided:

Option B is x² y + z³ + C. That matches what I derived. Let me double-check the other options to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Option A: 2x²y +3z^3 + C. Wait, my x² y term is correct, but this has 2x² y, which doesn't match. So A is wrong.

Option C: xy² + z^3. The x² y term is missing, so no.

Option H: x² y +3z^2. Oh, wait, the z term should be z cubed, not squared. So H is wrong.

Option J: x² y + z^2. Again, z squared instead of cubed, so no.

So the correct answer must be Option B.
</think>

The scalar potential function is found by integrating each component of the vector field and ensuring consistency across all partial derivatives. The resulting potential function is φ = x² y + z³ + C, which matches option B.

Answer: B
