Okay, so Howard Travers went on a trip to St. Louis and bought some gas, and now I need to find the average cost per gallon. Hmm, let's see. He bought 10 gallons at 33.9 cents, 14 gallons at 32.9 cents, 12 gallons at 31.9 cents, and 8 gallons at 29.9 cents. I think I need to find the total cost and then divide by the total gallons to get the average.

Wait, let me make sure. The question is asking for the average cost per gallon, so I'll have to sum all the individual costs and then divide by the total gallons. Right.

So first, I'll calculate each purchase's total cost. 

10 gallons at 33.9 cents: 10 * 33.9. Let me compute that. 33.9 * 10 is 339 cents.

Next, 14 gallons at 32.9 cents: 14 * 32.9. Hmm, 32.9 * 10 is 329, so 14 would be 32.9*10=329, plus 32.9*4=131.6. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Alternatively, 32.9 *14: 32.9 *10=329, 32.9 *4=131.6, adding them gives 329+131.6=460.6 cents.

Third, 12 gallons at 31.9 cents: 12 *31.9. Let's break it down: 31.9 *10=319, 31.9*2=63.8, so 319 +63.8 = 382.8 cents.

Fourth, 8 gallons at 29.9 cents: 8 *29.9. 30*8=240, minus 0.1*8=0.8, so 240-0.8=239.2 cents.

Now, add all these up. Let me add them one by one.

Start with 339 (10 gallons) +460.6 (14 gallons) = 339 + 460.6 = 799.6 cents.

Then add 382.8 (12 gallons): 799.6 + 382.8 = 1182.4.

Next, add 239.2 (8 gallons): 1182.4 + 239.2 = 1421.6 cents.

Wait, let me double-check that addition. 799.6 + 382.8: 700 + 300 is 1000, 99.6 +82.8 is 182.4, so total 1182.4. Then 1182.4 + 239.2. Let's see, 1182 + 239 is 1421, and 0.4 +0.2 is 0.6. So 1421.6 total cents.

Now, total gallons: 10 +14=24, 24+12=36, 36+8=44 gallons. So 44 gallons in total.

Average cost per gallon is total cents divided by 44.

So 1421.6 /44. Let's compute that. Let me see, 44 *32 is 1408. Because 40*32=1280, 4*32=128, so 1280+128=1408. So 1421.6 -1408 is 13.6.

So 32 plus 13.6 /44. 13.6 /44 is 0.31 (since 44*0.3=13.2, 44*0.31=13.64). Wait, that's a bit off. Wait, 44 * 0.31 is 13.64? No, wait, 44 *0.3 is 13.2, so 0.31 would be 13.2 +0.31*44? No, wait, 44 *0.31=44*(0.3 +0.01)=13.2 +0.44=13.64. But we have 13.6, which is 0.04 less than 13.64. So 0.31 - (0.04/44). Wait, perhaps I should compute 13.6 /44 as 0.31 approximately.

So 32.31 cents per gallon. Let me check with a calculator approach.

Alternatively, I can compute 1421.6 divided by 44:

44 into 1421.6.

44 *32 = 1408. Subtract that from 1421.6: 1421.6-1408=13.6.

Bring down the decimal: 13.6 divided by 44 is 0.31 (since 44 *0.31 is 13.64, which is a bit more than 13.6, so actually, it's 0.31 minus a tiny bit. So approximately 0.31 - 0.00136 = 0.30864, so about 0.3086.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to just compute 1421.6 /44.

Let me do this division step by step.

44 into 1421.6:

44*32=1408,

1421.6 -1408=13.6.

Now, 44 into 13.6 is 0.31 (because 44 *0.31=13.64). But 13.6 is a bit less than 13.64, so it would be 0.31 minus a little. Let's calculate how much.

Wait, 44*0.31=13.64, which is 0.04 more than 13.6. So 0.31 - (0.04/44) = 0.31 - 0.000909≈0.30909.

So approximately 0.30909.

So the total is 32.30909 cents per gallon.

Rounded to the nearest tenth: 32.3 cents.

Looking at the options, option F is 32.3 cents.

Wait, but let me double-check the sum because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, the individual totals:

10 gal: 33.9 *10=339.

14 gal: 32.9 *14=460.6.

12 gal:31.9 *12=382.8.

8 gal:29.9 *8=239.2.

Adding: 339 +460.6 =799.6.

799.6 +382.8 = 1182.4.

1182.4 +239.2 =1421.6. Correct.

Divide by 44: 1421.6 /44=32.31818... which rounds to 32.3 cents.

So the answer should be F, 32.3 cents.

To determine the average cost per gallon, sum the total cost and divide by the total gallons purchased.

1. Calculate each purchase's total cost:
   - 10 gal @ 33.9¢ = 339¢
   - 14 gal @ 32.9¢ = 460.6¢
   - 12 gal @ 31.9¢ = 382.8¢
   - 8 gal @ 29.9¢ = 239.2¢

2. Total cost = 339 + 460.6 + 382.8 + 239.2 = 1421.6¢

3. Total gallons = 10 + 14 + 12 + 8 = 44 gal

4. Average cost per gallon = 1421.6¢ / 44 = 32.318…¢, which rounds to 32.3¢.

The correct answer is F: 32.3 cents.
