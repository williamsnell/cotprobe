Okay, so I've got this question about logical fallacies, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is asking: If you argue that something is flawed because it fails to do something, but it was never intended to do that in the first place, which fallacy have you committed?

The options are A through D, with each being a different fallacy. I remember that logical fallacies are errors in reasoning that can undermine the logic of an argument. Let me try to recall each of these fallacies.

First, option A is "ad ignorantium." I think this refers to the argument from ignorance, where someone claims that a statement is true because it hasn't been proven false, or vice versa. So if someone says, "You can't prove it's not a ghost, so it must be a ghost," that's ad ignorantium. But in our question, the issue is about something failing to do something it wasn't meant to do. Not sure if this fits yet.

Option B is "Many questions." Hmm, I think that's also known as the loaded question fallacy. It's when a question is phrased in a way that assumes something that hasn't been proven. For example, "Have you stopped beating your wife?" It presupposes that you were beating your wife. But I'm not sure if that's exactly the case here. The question is more about misapplying a criticism, not necessarily a question.

Option C is "Extension." Wait, I'm not as sure about this one. I think extension might refer to extending an argument beyond its intended scope. Like, taking a point that applies to a specific situation and applying it to a much broader context where it doesn't hold. So, if someone says, "If we allow one person to skip the line, everyone will," that's a hasty generalization, maybe. But in the question, the issue is about the argument being made against something it wasn't intended to do. So perhaps extension is the right term here.

Option D is "Compound proposition." I'm not too clear on this one. Maybe it refers to an argument that combines multiple propositions in a way that's logically flawed. For example, if you have two unrelated points and try to link them, that could be a compound proposition fallacy. But I'm not sure how that applies here.

Let me think again. The scenario is that someone is criticizing something for failing to do X, but X wasn't part of its intended function. So they're applying a standard that doesn't apply. That sounds like a type of extension fallacy, where the argument is extended beyond its proper application.

Wait, I think I remember that the "argumentum ad extensionem" or "extension fallacy" is when someone argues that a concept applies to a broader context than it was intended for. So if you're using a tool meant for one job and criticizing it for not being good at another job it wasn't designed for, that's the extension fallacy.

So looking back at the options, C is "Extension." That must be the correct answer. The person is extending the argument beyond the intended scope, applying a criticism where it's unwarranted.

I don't think it's ad ignorantium because that's about lack of evidence. Many questions is more about the phrasing of a question, which isn't exactly the case here. And compound proposition doesn't seem to fit the scenario described.

The fallacy in question occurs when someone criticizes something for failing to do something it was never intended to do. This aligns with the "Extension" fallacy, where an argument is extended beyond its proper scope. 

Answer: C
