Question:

A physician is conducting a retrospective review of a trial involving the use of Drug X in patients with a specific disease. It is known that Drug X is associated with an increased probability of cancer in patients who use the drug. A total of 600 individuals with a specific disease were included in the trial. Of the participants, 200 individuals received Drug X and 400 individuals did not receive it. One hundred individuals who received Drug X died of a particular type of cancer and 100 individuals who did not receive the drug died of the same type of cancer. Based on these data, which of the following is the relative risk of death from this type of cancer in individuals who take Drug X as compared with individuals who do not take Drug X?

Options:

A: Individuals who take Drug X have two times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
B: Individuals who take Drug X have four times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
C: Individuals who take Drug X have three times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
D: Individuals who take Drug X have six times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
E: Individuals who do not take Drug X have three times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
F: Individuals who take Drug X have half the risk of dying from this type of cancer
G: Individuals who take Drug X have an equal risk of dying from this type of cancer
H: Individuals who do not take Drug X have two times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
I: Individuals who take Drug X have five times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
J: Individuals who take Drug X have zero risk of dying from this type of cancer

Okay, so I have this question about relative risk, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, there's a trial with Drug X and 600 people with a specific disease. 200 got Drug X, and 400 didn't. Among those who took Drug X, 100 died of a certain cancer. And among those who didn't take it, 100 also died of the same cancer. The question is about the relative risk of death from this cancer in Drug X users compared to non-users.

Wait, relative risk is calculated as the probability of the event happening in the exposed group divided by the probability in the non-exposed group. So I need to find the risk in each group first.

Let me start by finding the risk for each group. For Drug X users: 100 deaths out of 200 participants. So that's 100/200, which is 0.5 or 50%. For non-users: 100 deaths out of 400 participants. So that's 100/400, which is 0.25 or 25%.

Now, relative risk is the ratio of these two. So Drug X risk divided by non-Drug X risk: 0.5 / 0.25. Let me calculate that. 0.5 divided by 0.25 equals 2. So the relative risk is 2.

Hmm, but wait. The question says Drug X is associated with an increased probability of cancer. So if the risk is higher, then the relative risk should be greater than 1. In this case, it's 2, which means Drug X users have twice the risk compared to non-users.

Looking at the options, option A says individuals who take Drug X have two times the risk. That matches what I calculated. So the answer should be A.

But wait, did I mix up the groups? No, because relative risk is usually calculated as (exposed) / (unexposed). So yes, Drug X group is exposed, and they have a higher rate, so 2 times the risk.

I think that's correct. So the answer is A.

The relative risk is calculated by dividing the risk of death in the Drug X group by the risk in the non-Drug X group. The risk in the Drug X group is 100/200 = 0.5, and in the non-Drug X group, it's 100/400 = 0.25. Dividing these gives 0.5 / 0.25 = 2. Thus, Drug X users have twice the risk. 

Answer: A
