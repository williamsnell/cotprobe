Okay, so I have this problem to solve: I need to find the sum of the series from n=1 to infinity of (cost(1/n²) - cost(1/(n+1)²)). Hmm, wait, actually, I think "cost" might be a typo. In math, especially calculus, I've seen "cos" for cosine. Maybe "cost" is supposed to be "cos"? That would make sense because it's a trigonometric function. So I'll assume the question is about the cosine function. So the series is the sum from n=1 to infinity of [cos(1/n²) - cos(1/(n+1)²)].

Alright, so I need to evaluate this infinite series. Let me think about how to approach this. It looks like each term is the difference between consecutive terms in some sequence. Specifically, for each n, we're taking cos(1/n²) minus cos(1/(n+1)²). So when n is 1, it's cos(1) - cos(1/4). When n is 2, it's cos(1/4) - cos(1/9), and so on.

Wait a minute, this seems familiar. It looks like a telescoping series. A telescoping series is one where most terms cancel out when you write out the partial sums. Let me recall: a telescoping series has the form sum_{n=1}^∞ (a_n - a_{n+1}), where a_n is some sequence. The partial sum S_N would be (a_1 - a_2) + (a_2 - a_3) + ... + (a_N - a_{N+1}), which simplifies to a_1 - a_{N+1}. Then, taking the limit as N approaches infinity, the sum would be a_1 - lim_{N→∞} a_{N+1}.

In this problem, each term is [cos(1/n²) - cos(1/(n+1)²)], so indeed, it's a telescoping series where a_n = cos(1/n²). So the partial sum S_N would be [cos(1/1²) - cos(1/2²)] + [cos(1/2²) - cos(1/3²)] + ... + [cos(1/N²) - cos(1/(N+1)²)]. When we add these up, all the intermediate terms cancel out. So S_N = cos(1/1²) - cos(1/(N+1)²).

Now, to find the sum as N approaches infinity, we take the limit as N→∞ of S_N. So the sum would be lim_{N→∞} [cos(1) - cos(1/(N+1)²)].

Now, let's evaluate the limit. As N becomes very large, 1/(N+1)² approaches 0. So cos(1/(N+1)²) approaches cos(0), which is 1. Therefore, the limit becomes cos(1) - 1.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that. Because as N→∞, 1/(N+1)² approaches 0, so cos(1/(N+1)²) approaches cos(0)=1. So yes, the sum is cos(1) - 1.

But wait, let me compute the numerical value. Cos(1) is approximately... I remember that cos(0) is 1, cos(π/3)=0.5, but in radians, 1 radian is about 57 degrees. The cosine of 1 radian is approximately 0.5403. So cos(1) ≈ 0.5403. So 0.5403 - 1 = -0.4597. Hmm, that's approximately -0.4597, which rounds to about -0.459. Looking at the options, option J is -0.459.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the steps again. The sum is a telescoping series, so S = lim_{N→∞} [cos(1) - cos(1/(N+1)^2)]. As N→∞, cos(1/(N+1)^2) approaches cos(0) = 1. So S = cos(1) - 1. So the sum is cos(1) - 1 ≈ 0.5403 - 1 = -0.4597, which is approximately -0.459. So the answer should be J: -0.459.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the terms. The first term when n=1 is cos(1) - cos(1/4), then n=2 is cos(1/4) - cos(1/9), etc. So when you add them up, the cos(1/4) terms cancel, and so on. So yes, the partial sum is cos(1) - cos(1/(N+1)^2). So when N approaches infinity, it's cos(1) minus 1.

So the sum is cos(1) - 1 ≈ -0.4597, which is closest to -0.459, which is option J.

The given series is a telescoping series where each term cancels out intermediate terms, leaving only the first term of the first expression and the limit of the last term as n approaches infinity. The sum evaluates to cos(1) - 1, which is approximately -0.459.
