Okay, so I need to figure out the property tax on a house with an assessed value of $3,250 and a tax rate of 2.351%. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that property tax is calculated by multiplying the assessed value by the tax rate. So the formula should be something like Tax = Assessed Value × Tax Rate. 

Let me write that down: Tax = $3,250 × 2.351%. Wait, but the tax rate is a percentage, so I need to convert that into a decimal to do the multiplication correctly. I think I just divide the percentage by 100. So 2.351% becomes 0.02351.

Now, plugging the numbers in: $3,250 × 0.02351. I'm a bit unsure about doing this multiplication accurately, so maybe I should break it down step by step.

Let me calculate 3,250 × 0.02 first. 0.02 is 2%, so 3,250 × 0.02 is $65. That's easy enough. Now, the remaining part is 0.00351. So I need to find 3,250 × 0.00351.

Hmm, 0.00351 is the same as 351/100,000. Maybe it's easier to think of it as 3,250 multiplied by 0.003 and then by 0.00051 separately.

First, 3,250 × 0.003. Let's see, 3,250 × 3 is 9,750, but since it's 0.003, it's 9,750 divided by 1,000, which is $9.75.

Next, 3,250 × 0.00051. Let's break that down further. 0.0005 is 5/10,000, and 0.00001 is 1/100,000. So 3,250 × 0.0005 is 3,250 × 5 /10,000. That's 16,250 /10,000 which is $1.625. Then, 3,250 × 0.00001 is 0.0325. Adding those together, 1.625 + 0.0325 = $1.6575.

Now, adding up all the parts: the 2% part is $65, the 0.3% part is $9.75, and the 0.051% part is approximately $1.6575. So total is 65 + 9.75 + 1.6575.

Let's add 65 and 9.75 first. 65 + 9.75 = 74.75. Then add 1.6575: 74.75 + 1.6575 = 76.4075.

So the total tax should be approximately $76.41. Looking at the options, option C is $76.41. That seems right.

Wait, but I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me try calculating 3,250 × 0.02351 directly using a different method.

Alternatively, I can calculate 3,250 × 0.02351 step by step using multiplication.

Let me set it up:

3,250
× 0.02351
----------

I can ignore the decimal for a moment and multiply 3,250 by 2351, then adjust the decimal point.

But that might be complicated. Alternatively, I can break it down:

0.02351 is 2% + 0.351%. I already did 2% as $65. Now, 0.351% of 3,250.

0.351% is 0.00351 in decimal. So 3,250 × 0.00351.

Let me calculate 3,250 × 3.51 × 0.001.

Wait, 3,250 × 3.51 is... 3,250 × 3 is 9,750, 3,250 × 0.51 is 1,657.5. So total is 9,750 + 1,657.5 = 11,407.5. Then multiply by 0.001 gives 11.4075.

Wait, that doesn't seem right because earlier I thought it was about $1.65. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in breaking it down.

Wait, no, because 3,250 × 0.00351 is the same as (3,250 × 3.51) × 0.001. Let me calculate 3,250 × 3.51 first.

3,250 × 3 = 9,750.

3,250 × 0.5 = 1,625.

3,250 × 0.01 = 32.5.

So 3.51 is 3 + 0.5 + 0.01.

So 3,250 × 3 = 9,750.

3,250 × 0.5 = 1,625.

3,250 × 0.01 = 32.5.

Adding those together: 9,750 + 1,625 = 11,375; 11,375 + 32.5 = 11,407.5.

Now, multiply by 0.001: 11,407.5 × 0.001 = 11.4075.

Wait, that can't be right because earlier when I broke it down into 0.003 and 0.00051, I got about $1.65. Now, I'm getting $11.4075. That's a big discrepancy. I must have made a mistake in one of the methods.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the decimal places. Let me check again.

Wait, 0.00351 is 351/100,000. So 3,250 × 0.00351 = (3,250 × 351) / 100,000.

Let me compute 3,250 × 351.

3,250 × 300 = 975,000.

3,250 × 50 = 162,500.

3,250 × 1 = 3,250.

Adding them together: 975,000 + 162,500 = 1,137,500; plus 3,250 is 1,140,750.

Now, divide by 100,000: 1,140,750 ÷ 100,000 = 11.4075.

Wait, so that's $11.4075. But earlier, when I broke it into 0.003 and 0.00051, I got $9.75 + $1.6575 = $11.4075. Oh, okay, so that's consistent now. I must have made a miscalculation earlier when I thought it was $1.65. So the correct amount for 0.00351 is $11.4075.

Wait, but earlier when I did 3,250 × 0.02351 by adding 2% and 0.351%, I had 2% as $65 and 0.351% as $11.4075, which adds up to $76.4075, which rounds to $76.41, matching option C.

Wait, but earlier when I thought 0.003 was $9.75 and 0.00051 was $1.6575, adding to $11.4075, that's correct. So the total is $65 + $11.4075 = $76.4075, which is approximately $76.41.

So the correct answer should be option C: $76.41.
</think>

The property tax is calculated by multiplying the assessed value of $3,250 by the tax rate of 2.351%. Converting the tax rate to a decimal (0.02351) and performing the multiplication gives a total tax of approximately $76.41.
