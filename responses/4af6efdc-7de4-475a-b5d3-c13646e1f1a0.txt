Okay, so I have this question about the 'new racism' and I need to figure out which option correctly defines it. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I remember that 'new racism' isn't exactly a term I hear every day, but I think it's a concept discussed in sociological or cultural studies. From what I recall, it's different from the overt racism of the past. The old racism was more explicit, like segregation or direct discrimination based on biological differences. But the new racism is more subtle and隐蔽 (hidden), right?

Looking at the options, I need to see which one captures that subtlety. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: "a subtler form of prejudice, masked by nationalist pride." Hmm, that sounds plausible. Nationalist pride can sometimes be a cover for racist sentiments, making it seem like it's about loyalty to the country rather than inherent racism.

Option B: "a trend of neo-nazism masked as patriotism." Neo-nazism is a specific form of racism, but I think new racism is broader than just neo-nazism. Plus, patriotism is a different concept, though sometimes linked with racism.

Option C: "a form of racism that only exists within the realm of social media." No, that doesn't sound right. Racism exists in many areas, not just online. Social media might amplify it, but it's not the only place.

Option D: "an anti-fascist movement which challenges nationalist politics." That seems off because anti-fascism is against far-right ideologies, including racism, but it's not the same as being a form of racism itself.

Option E: "an increased awareness and sensitivity towards racism in contemporary society." This sounds more like a positive trend, not a form of racism. So probably not the correct definition.

Option F: "a post-modern deconstruction of racist ideas to reveal their lack of depth." That's more about analyzing racism rather than being a new form of it. So not this one.

Option G: "a radical form of racism that encourages open discrimination." Radical and overt racism is the old kind, not the new subtle form. So this might be the opposite of what new racism is.

Option H: "a form of racism practiced by newly established countries." I don't think new racism is tied to new countries specifically. It's more about the methods used rather than the country's age.

Option I: "racist practices found in newly emerging areas of social life, such as cyberspace." While cyberspace is a new area, I'm not sure if that's the defining feature of new racism. It might be a part of it, but not the whole definition.

Option J: "the rise of racism in new political parties." Again, this seems more about where racism appears rather than the nature of the racism itself.

So, going back to Option A: It talks about a subtler form, hidden under nationalist pride. That fits with what I know about new racism being more insidious and using other justifications, like nationalism, to mask the prejudice. Nationalist pride can be a cover for racist policies or attitudes without directly addressing race.

Therefore, the answer should be A.

The term 'new racism' refers to a subtler form of prejudice that is often masked by nationalist pride. This form of racism is more insidious and uses concepts like nationalism to disguise its discriminatory nature, as opposed to the overt racism of the past.
