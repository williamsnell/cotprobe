Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find how many positive integers x ≤ 100 make 3^x - x² divisible by 5. That means I'm looking for x such that 3^x ≡ x² mod 5. Hmm, okay, modular arithmetic. Let me break this down.

First, I remember that when working modulo 5, both 3^x and x² will cycle in some pattern. Maybe if I can figure out the patterns for 3^x mod 5 and x² mod 5, I can find when they're equal.

Let me start with 3^x mod 5. I think 3 has a cycle of 4 when raised to powers modulo 5. Let me check:

3^1 mod5 = 3
3^2 mod5 = 9 mod5 = 4
3^3 mod5 = 27 mod5 = 2
3^4 mod5 = 81 mod5 = 1
3^5 mod5 = 3 again, so yes, cycle length is 4: 3,4,2,1 repeating every 4.

So 3^x mod5 cycles every 4. So for x, the exponent modulo 4 will determine 3^x mod5. So x mod4 can be 0,1,2,3, etc., and that will give 3^x mod5 as 1,3,4,2 respectively.

Now, let's look at x² mod5. The squares modulo 5 are:

0²=0 →0
1²=1 →1
2²=4 →4
3²=9 →4
4²=16 →1
So the possible residues are 0,1,4. So for any x, x² mod5 can only be 0,1, or4.

So for 3^x mod5 to equal x² mod5, either:

3^x ≡0 mod5: but 3^x mod5 is never 0 because 3 and 5 are coprime. So that's impossible.

So only possibilities are 3^x ≡1, 3^x ≡1, or 3^x ≡4. Wait, no, 3^x can be 3,4,2,1 as per the cycle. So matching to x²'s possible residues 0,1,4, the only possible matches are when 3^x mod5 is 1 or 4, because x² can be 1 or4.

Wait, let me list all possible cases:

Looking for 3^x ≡ x² mod5. So possible cases where 3^x mod5 is either 1 or4, since x² can be 0,1,4. But since 3^x can't be 0, only 1 and 4.

So let's find for each x mod4 (since 3^x has cycle 4) and x mod5 (since x² depends on x mod5), the matching conditions.

Wait, maybe it's easier to consider x mod 20 because 4 and 5 are coprime, so the least common multiple is 20. So perhaps the pattern repeats every 20 numbers. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe I can find for each residue mod5, what x needs to be.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a system.

Let me consider x mod4 and x mod5. Because 3^x mod5 depends on x mod4, and x² mod5 depends on x mod5.

So for each possible x mod20 (since 4 and5 are coprime, their LCM is 20), I can compute 3^x mod5 and x² mod5 and see when they are equal.

That might be a bit tedious, but perhaps manageable.

Wait, let me try to structure this.

So, for x from 0 to 19, I can compute 3^x mod5 and x² mod5, and note when they are equal. Then, since the pattern repeats every 20, I can find how many valid x's are in each 20-number block, then multiply by the number of blocks in 100, and handle the remainder.

So first, let's compute for x = 0 to 19:

x: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19.

Compute 3^x mod5, x² mod5, and check if equal.

Let me make a table:

x | 3^x mod5 | x² mod5 | Equal?
---|--------|--------|-----
0 | 3^0=1 | 0^2=0 | 1 vs 0 → no
1 |3^1=3 |1²=1 →3 vs1 →no
2 |3^2=4 |2²=4 →4 vs4 →yes
3 |3^3=2 |3²=9 mod5=4 →2 vs4 →no
4 |3^4=1 |4²=16 mod5=1 →1 vs1 →yes
5 |3^5=3 (since 5 mod4=1) |5²=25 mod5=0 →3 vs0 →no
6 |3^6=4 (6 mod4=2) |6²=36 mod5=1 →4 vs1 →no
7 |3^7=2 (7 mod4=3) |7²=49 mod5=4 →2 vs4 →no
8 |3^8=1 (8 mod4=0) |8²=64 mod5=4 →1 vs4 →no
9 |3^9=3 (9 mod4=1) |9²=81 mod5=1 →3 vs1 →no
10|3^10=4 (10 mod4=2) |10²=100 mod5=0 →4 vs0 →no
11|3^11=2 (11 mod4=3) |11²=121 mod5=1 →2 vs1 →no
12|3^12=1 (12 mod4=0) |12²=144 mod5=4 →1 vs4 →no
13|3^13=3 (13 mod4=1) |13²=169 mod5=4 →3 vs4 →no
14|3^14=4 (14 mod4=2) |14²=196 mod5=1 →4 vs1 →no
15|3^15=2 (15 mod4=3) |15²=225 mod5=0 →2 vs0 →no
16|3^16=1 (16 mod4=0) |16²=256 mod5=1 →1 vs1 →yes
17|3^17=3 (17 mod4=1) |17²=289 mod5=4 →3 vs4 →no
18|3^18=4 (18 mod4=2) |18²=324 mod5=4 →4 vs4 →yes
19|3^19=2 (19 mod4=3) |19²=361 mod5=1 →2 vs1 →no

Now, looking at the 'Equal?' column, the x values where they are equal are x=2,4,16,18.

Wait, that's four x's in 0-19 where 3^x ≡x² mod5.

Wait, but x starts at 1. Wait, in the table above, x=0 is included, but the problem says positive integers x ≤100, so x starts at 1. So in x=0, it's not counted.

So from x=1 to x=19 (since 19 is less than 20), the valid x's are 2,4,16,18. That's four numbers.

Wait, but in the table above, x=0: no, x=1: no, x=2: yes, x=3: no, x=4: yes, x=5: no, x=6: no, x=7: no, x=8: no, x=9: no, x=10: no, x=11: no, x=12: no, x=13: no, x=14: no, x=15: no, x=16: yes, x=17: no, x=18: yes, x=19: no.

Wait, so in 1-19, the valid x's are 2,4,16,18. So four in total.

Wait, but in the table above, x=16 is 16, which is 16 mod20=16, and x=18 is 18 mod20=18.

So each 20-number block (like 1-20, 21-40, etc.) has 4 valid x's? Or maybe 4 in 0-19, but since x starts at 1, perhaps 4 in each 20-number block.

Wait, but from x=1 to x=20, the valid x's would be 2,4,16,18. So four in each 20.

So if that's the case, then in 100 numbers, how many 20-number blocks are there? 100/20=5. So 5 blocks, each contributing 4 valid x's. So 5*4=20.

Wait, but wait, let me check if x=20 is included. At x=20, 3^20 mod5: since 20 mod4=0, so 3^20 mod5=1. x²=20²=400 mod5=0. So 1≠0, so x=20 is not valid.

So from x=1 to x=20, the valid x's are 2,4,16,18: four numbers.

Similarly, from x=21 to x=40, the same pattern would repeat. So 21 would be x=1 mod20, which would be like x=1, which isn't valid. Then x=22 (2 mod20) would be valid, x=24 (4 mod20) valid, etc.

So each 20 numbers contribute 4 valid x's.

So in 100 numbers, 100/20=5 blocks, each with 4 valid x's, so 5*4=20.

But wait, wait, 100 is exactly 5 blocks of 20, so 5*4=20. So the answer would be 20, which is option D.

But wait, let me double-check. Let me see if the pattern holds beyond 20.

Let me check x=21: 21 mod4=1, so 3^21 mod5=3. x²=21²=441 mod5=1. So 3≠1 → no.

x=22: 22 mod4=2 →3^22=4. x²=22²=484 mod5=4. So 4=4 → yes. So x=22 is valid.

Similarly, x=24: 24 mod4=0 →3^24=1. x²=24²=576 mod5=1 → yes.

x=26: 26 mod4=2 →3^26=4. x²=26²=676 mod5=1 →4≠1 →no. Wait, that's a problem.

Wait, wait, 26 mod4 is 2, so 3^26 mod5=4. But x=26: 26²=676, which mod5 is 676-5*135=676-675=1 →1. So 4≠1, so x=26 is not valid.

Wait, but according to the earlier pattern, x=22 (2 mod20) is valid, x=24 (4 mod20) is valid, x=26 (6 mod20) would be 6 mod4=2, so 3^6=4, and x²=6²=36 mod5=1. So 4≠1 → no.

Hmm, that's confusing. So maybe the pattern isn't exactly 4 per 20. Did I make a mistake earlier?

Wait, let me recount the valid x's in 1-20:

x=2: yes

x=4: yes

x=16: yes

x=18: yes

That's four. So in each 20, four x's.

But when I checked x=26 (which is 6 mod20), it's not valid.

Wait, but according to the table, x=6 is not valid. So perhaps the valid x's are every 20, but only at positions 2,4,16,18. So in 21-40, it's 22,24,36,38. Because 21+2=23? Wait, no, 21+ (2)=23? Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe the valid x's in each 20-number block are the same as in the first block. So for example, in 1-20, it's 2,4,16,18.

In 21-40, it's 22,24,36,38.

In 41-60, it's 42,44,56,58.

In 61-80, it's 62,64,76,78.

In 81-100, it's 82,84,96,98.

Wait, that's 4 x's per block, 5 blocks, so 20 x's total. But when I checked x=26 (which is 6 mod20), it's not valid, which aligns with the table because x=6 wasn't valid.

So total valid x's would be 20.

But wait, let me check x=22: 22 mod4=2 →3^22 mod5=4. x²=22²=484 mod5=4 → yes.

x=24: mod4=0 →3^24=1. x²=24²=576 mod5=1 → yes.

x=36: mod4=0 →3^36=1. x²=36²=1296 mod5=1 → yes.

x=38: mod4=2 →3^38=4. x²=38²=1444 mod5=1444-5*288=1444-1440=4 → yes.

Yes, so x=22,24,36,38 are valid in 21-40.

Similarly, x=42: mod4=2 →3^42=4. x²=42²=1764 mod5=1764-5*352=1764-1760=4 → yes.

x=44: mod4=0 →3^44=1. x²=44²=1936 mod5=1 → yes.

x=56: mod4=0 →3^56=1. x²=56²=3136 mod5=1 → yes.

x=58: mod4=2 →3^58=4. x²=58²=3364 mod5=3364-5*672=3364-3360=4 → yes.

Same for 62,64,76,78, etc.

So each 20-number block contributes 4 valid x's, and there are 5 such blocks in 100, so 5*4=20.

So the answer should be 20, which is option D.

To determine how many positive integers \( x \leq 100 \) satisfy \( 3^x - x^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \), we analyze the modular behavior of \( 3^x \) and \( x^2 \) modulo 5.

1. **Pattern of \( 3^x \mod 5 \):**  
   The powers of 3 modulo 5 cycle every 4 terms:  
   \( 3^1 \equiv 3 \), \( 3^2 \equiv 4 \), \( 3^3 \equiv 2 \), \( 3^4 \equiv 1 \), and then repeat.

2. **Pattern of \( x^2 \mod 5 \):**  
   The squares modulo 5 yield residues 0, 1, and 4.

3. **Matching Conditions:**  
   We seek \( 3^x \equiv x^2 \pmod{5} \). Since \( 3^x \) can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4 modulo 5, and \( x^2 \) can only be 0, 1, or 4, the valid matches occur when \( 3^x \) is 1 or 4 modulo 5 (as 0 is impossible for \( 3^x \)).

4. **Finding Valid \( x \):**  
   By examining \( x \) modulo 20 (the least common multiple of 4 and 5), we determine the valid \( x \) values in each 20-number block. In each block, the valid \( x \) values are 2, 4, 16, and 18.

5. **Counting Valid \( x \):**  
   Since there are 5 blocks of 20 within 100, and each block contains 4 valid \( x \) values, the total number of valid \( x \) values is \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \).

Thus, the answer is **D: 20**.
