The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

In a frictionless world economy, resources would be perfectly mobile. As it is now, immigration, emigration and capital outflow restrictions severely limit resource mobility. How do the changes in supply and demand, and the consequent price changes, brought about by application of comparative advantage, tend to compensate for the immobility of re- sources .

Options:

A: Trade causes the price of resources to skyrocket
B: Trade causes the price of resources to become more volatile
C: Trade roughly matches up the worldwide demand for resources, with the world-wide supply.
D: Trade leads to a scarcity of resources in regions with comparative disadvantage
E: Trade results in an equal distribution of resources across all countries regardless of supply and demand
F: Trade perpetuates the immobility of resources by creating dependency on imports
G: Trade eliminates the need for resource mobility
H: Trade leads to a surplus of resources
I: Trade consistently reduces the worldwide demand for resources
J: Trade ensures that resources are only allocated to the most developed economies

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this economics question about comparative advantage and resource mobility. Hmm, let's break it down.

The question says that in a frictionless world economy, resources are perfectly mobile. But in reality, things like immigration, emigration, and capital outflows limit that mobility. So the question is asking how the changes in supply and demand, and the price changes from comparative advantage, compensate for this immobility.

I remember that comparative advantage is about countries specializing in what they're good at and trading for other goods. So even if resources can't move freely, trade can sort of mimic the effects of those resources moving. 

When resources are immobile, like if labor or capital can't move to another country, trade allows countries to get the things they need without physically moving resources. For example, if Country A is good at producing wheat and Country B is good at producing cars, they'll trade. This way, both countries end up with the goods they need based on their comparative advantage.

Looking at the options, option C says trade roughly matches worldwide demand with supply. That makes sense because trade would balance out supply and demand across countries without the need for resources to move. So even if resources can't move, trade adjusts the prices and quantities so that the overall supply meets demand globally.

Option A says prices skyrocket, but trade usually evens things out, so that's not it. Option B talks about volatility, which isn't necessarily the case. Option D mentions scarcity, but trade should help avoid that by bringing in needed goods. Option E is about equal distribution, which isn't the case because trade follows supply and demand. Option F suggests trade causes dependency, but that's not the main point here. Option G says trade eliminates the need for mobility, which is partially true but maybe not the whole story. Option H is about surplus, which isn't guaranteed. Option I talks about reducing demand, which doesn't fit. Option J says resources go only to developed economies, which isn't correct either.

So, the best fit is option C. Trade helps match global supply and demand, compensating for the lack of resource mobility.

The correct answer is C. Trade roughly matches up the worldwide demand for resources, with the worldwide supply.
