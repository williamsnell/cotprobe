Okay, so I have this economics question here about what happens to the equilibrium price level and output when the aggregate supply curve shifts to the left. I remember that aggregate supply (AS) is one of the key curves in macroeconomics, along with aggregate demand (AD). The question specifies that the AS curve is upward sloping, which makes sense because as the price level increases, firms are willing to supply more goods and services.

So, the AS curve shifting to the left would mean that for any given price level, the quantity of output supplied decreases. I'm trying to visualize this. If the AS curve shifts left, it moves from, say, AS1 to AS2 where AS2 is parallel but to the left of AS1. The point where AS intersects with AD determines the equilibrium.

When the AS shifts left, the new equilibrium will be where the same AD curve meets the new, smaller AS. Since AS is decreasing at every price level, the equilibrium quantity must decrease. But what about the price level? If the same AD curve is now intersecting a smaller AS, the price level must go up because there's less supply meeting the same demand. So the equilibrium price increases, and the equilibrium quantity decreases.

Wait, let me think again. Aggregate demand is downward sloping because as price levels rise, the quantity demanded decreases. So if AS shifts left, the economy can't produce as much. At the same time, because the economy is producing less, the prices might rise due to the reduced supply. So yes, the price level goes up and output goes down.

Looking at the options, option B says the equilibrium price increases and output decreases. That sounds right. Let me make sure I'm not confusing it with a shift in the AD curve. If AD shifts left, both price and quantity would decrease. But here, it's the AS shifting left, so the opposite happensâ€”price up, quantity down.

I think that's correct. So the answer should be B.

When the aggregate supply (AS) curve shifts to the left, the economy's ability to produce goods and services decreases at every price level. This leads to a new equilibrium where the same aggregate demand (AD) curve intersects the leftward-shifted AS curve. As a result, the equilibrium quantity of output decreases because the economy is producing less. Simultaneously, the equilibrium price level increases due to the reduced supply relative to the unchanged demand. Therefore, the correct answer is that the equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output decreases.
