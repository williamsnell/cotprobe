Question:

What is a demand schedule, a supply schedule, and market price?

Options:

A: A demand schedule is a table showing the relationship between the price of a good and the consumer's income. A supply schedule is a table showing how the cost of production affects the price of a good. Market price is the average price of a good across different markets.
B: A demand schedule is a detailed plan for a consumer's future purchases at varying price levels. A supply schedule is a forecast of a producer's future sales at different price points. Market price is the sum of the cost of production and a standard profit margin.
C: A demand schedule is the maximum price a consumer is willing to pay for various quantities of a good. A supply schedule is the minimum quantity a producer is willing to offer at different prices. Market price is determined by government intervention.
D: A demand schedule is a fixed amount of a good that a consumer can buy at any price. A supply schedule is a fixed amount of a good that a producer can sell at any price. Market price is an arbitrary price set by market regulators.
E: A demand schedule is the quantity of a good a consumer wants to buy. A supply schedule is the quantity of a good a producer wants to sell. Market price is the lowest price a producer is willing to charge.
F: A demand schedule is a record of previous purchases made by a consumer at different prices. A supply schedule is a record of previous sales made by a producer at different prices. Market price is the most commonly observed price in the market.
G: A demand schedule is a list of prices at which a consumer is indifferent to buying a good. A supply schedule is a list of prices at which a producer is indifferent to selling a good. Market price is the equilibrium price determined by a central planning authority.
H: A demand schedule is a list of all possible prices for a good. A supply schedule is a list of all possible quantities of a good. Market price is the highest price a consumer is willing to pay.
I: A demand schedule is a graph showing the relationship between price and quantity demanded. A supply schedule is a graph showing the relationship between price and quantity supplied. Market price is the price at which supply equals demand.
J: A demand schedule is a listing of the quantities of a good a consumer is willing to buy and the corresponding prices. A supply schedule is a listing of the quantities of a good a producer is willing to offer and the corresponding prices. Market price is the price at which the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied.

Okay, so I need to figure out what a demand schedule, a supply schedule, and market price are. I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember from my economics class that supply and demand are fundamental concepts. Let me start by recalling what a demand schedule is. I think it's something related to how much of a good people want to buy at different prices. Maybe it's like a table showing quantities demanded at various prices. So for example, if the price of apples goes up, people might buy fewer apples. That makes sense because higher prices would reduce the quantity demanded.

Now, a supply schedule. I believe this is similar but from the seller's side. It shows how much of a good producers are willing to sell at different prices. So, if the price of wheat increases, farmers might be willing to supply more because they can make more money. So the supply schedule would list quantities supplied at various prices.

As for market price, I think it's the actual price that's set in the market where supply meets demand. When the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded, that's the equilibrium point, and that's where the market price settles. So it's the price that balances the supply and demand in the market.

Looking at the options now. Let's go through each one.

Option A: It says demand schedule is about price and income, which doesn't sound right. I thought it's about price and quantity demanded. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: Demand is a plan for future purchases at varying prices? That sounds more like a forecast or expectation, not sure. And supply as future sales at different prices. Not sure about that either. Market price as sum of cost and profit margin? That doesn't sound right because market price is determined by supply and demand, not just cost plus profit.

Option C: Demand is the maximum price a consumer is willing to pay for various quantities. Hmm, I thought demand is the quantity they want at different prices, not the maximum price. And supply as minimum quantity producers are willing to offer at different prices. That might be part of it, but I'm not sure. Market price determined by government intervention? No, usually it's where supply meets demand unless there's a price control.

Option D: Demand is a fixed amount regardless of price. No, demand changes with price. Likewise for supply. So D is wrong.

Option E: Demand is the quantity a consumer wants to buy, which sounds correct. Supply is the quantity producers want to sell, which also sounds correct. Market price is the lowest price producers are willing to charge? Wait, no. Market price is where supply meets demand, not just the lowest producers are willing to charge. So E might be partially correct but the market price part is wrong.

Option F: Demand is a record of past purchases, and supply past sales. That doesn't fit. Market price as most common price? Not sure, but I think it's more about equilibrium.

Option G: Demand is a list of prices where consumers are indifferent. That doesn't make sense. Indifference curves are more for when you have multiple goods. And market price as equilibrium by central planning? No, in free markets, it's supply and demand, not central planning.

Option H: Demand is a list of all prices for a good. That doesn't seem right. Supply as all possible quantities? Not sure. Market price as highest price consumers are willing to pay? That's the maximum they'd pay, but the actual price is where supply meets demand, which could be lower than that maximum.

Option I: Demand is a graph of price vs quantity demanded. That's correct because demand curves show that relationship. Similarly for supply. Market price is where supply equals demand, which makes sense. So I is looking good.

Option J: J says demand is a list of quantities and corresponding prices a consumer is willing to buy. That sounds more like a demand schedule, but usually, the demand schedule is about quantity demanded at different prices, so it's a table of price and quantity. Similarly for supply. Market price is where quantity demanded equals supplied, which is correct.

Wait, but I thought a demand schedule is a table showing price and quantity demanded, not a graph. So I think option I might be mixing up schedules with curves. Because a schedule is a table, while a graph is a curve.

So looking back, the question is about schedules, which are tables. So option J says demand schedule is a listing of quantities and corresponding prices, which sounds like a table. So J's description of schedules is correct, and the market price is where supply meets demand, which is correct.

Option I describes graphs, not schedules. So the correct answer should be J.

The correct answer is J. A demand schedule is a table listing the quantities of a good a consumer is willing to buy at various prices, and a supply schedule is a table listing the quantities a producer is willing to sell at various prices. The market price is where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied, which is the equilibrium price.

Answer: J
