Okay, so I've got this accounting question about contingent liabilities, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about Stark Co., which is a defendant in a lawsuit that happened in October. As of December 31, they're about to issue their financial statements. Their legal counsel thinks it's "reasonably possible" they'll lose and that the damages could be between $100,000 and $150,000. The question is asking what they should accrue and disclose.

First, I remember that contingent liabilities are potential liabilities that depend on the outcome of some future event. In accounting, especially under GAAP, there are specific rules about when to recognize these as liabilities on the balance sheet and what to disclose in the notes.

So, the key points here are the probability and the range of damages. The legal counsel says it's "reasonably possible" that Stark will lose. I think "reasonably possible" is a specific term here. From what I recall, if the outcome is "probable," then the company must accrue the liability. But if it's only "reasonably possible," they don't have to accrue it but have to disclose it.

Wait, let me double-check that. The hierarchy is something like this: if it's probable, you must recognize the liability. If it's possible but not probable, you don't recognize it but disclose the nature and range. If it's remote, you neither recognize nor disclose, I think.

In the question, the probability is "reasonably possible," which is less than probable. So, according to GAAP, they don't need to accrue a liability because it's not probable yet. But they do have to disclose the contingent liability because it's possible and material.

So, the company shouldn't accrue any amount because it's not probable. They should, however, disclose the range of possible damages, which is from $100k to $150k.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one says they accrue $0 and disclose $100k - $150k.

Looking at the options:

A: Accrue 150k, disclose 0. No, that's the opposite.

B: Accrue 0, disclose 150k. Hmm, but the question says the range is 100k-150k, so just 150k might not capture the full range.

C: Accrue 0, disclose 0. No, they need to disclose.

D: Accrue 0, disclose 100k-150k. Yes, that matches what I was thinking.

E: Accrue 100k, disclose 150k. No, because they shouldn't accrue at all.

F: Accrue 100k, disclose 0. No, same issue.

G: Accrue 100k, disclose 100k. No.

H: Accrue 150k, disclose 150k. No.

I: Accrue 150k, disclose 100k-150k. No, they shouldn't accrue.

J: Accrue 100k, disclose 100k-150k. They shouldn't accrue, so J is out.

So the correct option is D: Accrue $0 and disclose the range of $100,000 to $150,000.

The correct answer is D: $0 $100000 - $150000. Stark Co. should not accrue any liability because the outcome is not probable, but they must disclose the contingent liability range.

Answer: D
