Okay, so I've got this question about cascaded amplifiers and their noise temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question gives three stages of a cascaded amplifier with power gains G1=15, G2=10, G3=5. Each stage has an effective input noise temperature: T_e1=1350K, T_e2=1700K, T_e3=2500K. The problem asks for two things: (a) the overall effective noise temperature and (b) the ordering of the cascaded stages to achieve optimum noise performance.

First, I remember that when amplifiers are cascaded, their noise contributions depend on the order they are connected. The overall noise temperature isn't just the sum; it's more involved because each stage affects the next.

I think the formula for the overall noise temperature when cascading amplifiers is something like T_total = T1 + (T2 / G1) + (T3 / (G1*G2)). Wait, no, maybe it's T_total = T1 + (T2/G1) + (T3/(G1*G2)). Because each subsequent stage's noise is divided by the gains of all previous stages. So the earlier stages contribute more because their noise isn't attenuated as much.

Wait, no, wait. Oh right, the noise from each stage adds up, but the noise from later stages is multiplied by the inverse of the product of the gains of the preceding stages. So the formula is T_total = T1 + (T2)/(G1) + (T3)/(G1*G2).

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The noise figure is additive when considering the cascaded stages, but with each stage's noise referred to the input. So for a cascaded system, the overall noise temperature is given by T_total = Te1 + (Te2)/(G1) + (Te3)/(G1*G2).

So in this case, substituting the given values:

Te1 is 1350K, Te2 is 1700K, Te3 is 2500K.

G1 is 15, G2 is 10, G3 is 5, but wait, wait. Wait, the gains for the third stage would be G1 * G2 * G3, but in terms of the noise contribution, each subsequent stage's Te is divided by the product of the gains up to the previous stage.

So T_total = Te1 + (Te2)/(G1) + (Te3)/(G1*G2).

Wait, but the order of the stages matters because the gains G1 and G2 would be from the first two stages, so if the stages are arranged differently, the gains used for each Te would change.

Wait, but the problem also asks about the ordering to achieve optimum noise performance. I remember that to minimize the overall noise temperature, you should place the stages with higher gains earlier in the cascade. Because higher gain stages amplify the noise less from the subsequent stages, so their noise is divided by a larger number, making their contribution smaller.

So the optimal order would be highest gain first. That way, the stages with higher gains come first, reducing the contribution of the noise from the lower gain stages more.

Wait, let me check that. If I have a high gain stage first, then the noise from the second stage is divided by a larger G1, so its contribution is smaller. Similarly, the third stage's noise is divided by G1*G2, which is even larger. So arranging higher gains first would minimize the overall noise.

So for part (b), the order should be highest gain first, meaning G1=15 first, then G2=10, then G3=5.

But wait, the options given don't have all of them. Let me look at the options again.

Options for part (b) are about ordering. So the ordering to achieve optimum noise performance is highest gain first. So looking at the options, option C says 1480K, highest gain first. Option A is 1480K, lowest gain first. So for part (a), I need to compute T_total.

Wait, let's compute T_total using the formula.

Assuming the order is G1=15, G2=10, G3=5.

So T_total = Te1 + Te2/(G1) + Te3/(G1*G2).

Te1 = 1350K.

Te2=1700K, so 1700/15 ≈ 113.333 K.

Te3=2500K, so 2500/(15*10) = 2500/150 ≈16.6667 K.

Adding them up: 1350 + 113.333 + 16.6667 ≈ 1350 + 130 = 1480 K. So T_total is 1480 K.

Hmm, that matches option A and C. Now, the order for best performance is highest gain first, so option C says 1480K, highest gain first. But let me check if the order affects the overall noise temperature.

Wait, if the order is different, say, putting the lower gain stages first, would the T_total be higher?

Let's try another order, say, G3=5 first, then G2=10, then G1=15.

In that case, the gains would be G1=5, G2=10, G3=15? No, wait, G1 is the first stage's gain, G2 is second, etc.

Wait, no, if we change the order, the gains for each stage in the formula would change.

Wait, for example, if the order is G3=5 first, then G2=10, then G1=15.

Then the formula would be:

Te1 (first stage) is 2500K.

Te2 (second stage) is 1700K, divided by G1=5.

Te3 (third stage) is 1350K, divided by G1*G2=5*10=50.

So T_total = 2500 + (1700/5) + (1350/50).

Calculating:

1700/5=340.

1350/50=27.

So T_total = 2500 + 340 +27 = 2867 K, which is way higher than 1480. So definitely, the order matters a lot.

Another example: order G2=10 first, then G1=15, then G3=5.

Then:

Te1=1700K.

Te2=1350K /10 = 135 K.

Te3=2500K/(10*15)=2500/150≈16.6667 K.

So T_total =1700 +135 +16.6667 ≈ 1851.6667 K, which is higher than 1480.

So the optimal arrangement is indeed highest gain first, leading to T_total of 1480 K.

Looking back at the options, option C is 1480K, highest gain first. So that's the answer for both parts (a) and (b).

Wait, but let me check if there are any options that match that. Options A and C have 1480K. A says lowest gain first, which would be G3=5 first. But we saw that gives a higher T_total. So the correct answer is option C: 1480K, highest gain first.

The overall effective noise temperature for the cascaded amplifier stages is calculated using the formula:

\[
T_{\text{total}} = T_{e1} + \frac{T_{e2}}{G_1} + \frac{T_{e3}}{G_1 \cdot G_2}
\]

Given the power gains \( G_1 = 15 \), \( G_2 = 10 \), \( G_3 = 5 \), and effective input noise temperatures \( T_{e1} = 1350 \, \text{K} \), \( T_{e2} = 1700 \, \text{K} \), \( T_{e3} = 2500 \, \text{K} \), the optimal ordering of stages to minimize the overall noise temperature is to place the stages with the highest gains first. This minimizes the contribution of noise from subsequent stages, as their noise is divided by larger gains.

Substituting the values into the formula:

\[
T_{\text{total}} = 1350 + \frac{1700}{15} + \frac{2500}{15 \cdot 10}
\]

\[
T_{\text{total}} = 1350 + 113.33 + 16.67 \approx 1480 \, \text{K}
\]

Thus, the overall effective noise temperature is \( 1480 \, \text{K} \), and the optimal ordering is highest gain first.
