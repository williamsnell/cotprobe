Alright, so I've got this question about Hobbes and his description of felicity. I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that Thomas Hobbes was a pretty significant philosopher, especially known for his work in political philosophy. His book "Leviathan" is famous, where he talks about the state of nature and the social contract. But I'm not too sure about his views on felicity, which I think relates to happiness or well-being.

The question is asking what Hobbes describes felicity as. The options are A through J, each with a different definition. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: the absence of desire. Hmm, that sounds a bit like Stoicism where desire is something to be rid of, but I'm not sure if Hobbes would agree. I think Hobbes might have a different take on desire.

Option B: a state of constant dissatisfaction. That doesn't sound right. If someone is constantly dissatisfied, that's more like a state of unhappiness, which I don't think is what felicity is about.

Option C: a state of constant change. Felicity as constant change? I'm not sure. I don't recall Hobbes emphasizing change as the key to happiness.

Option D: the absence of progress. That seems counterintuitive. Progress usually leads to betterment, so absence of progress might lead to stagnation, not happiness.

Option E: a state of satisfaction with one's current state. This sounds plausible. I think Hobbes might have seen contentment as a form of happiness, where you're satisfied with what you have.

Option F: the fulfilment of all desires. This seems too much. Fulfilling all desires might not be realistic and could lead to other issues, so I'm not sure if Hobbes would define felicity this way.

Option G: a continual progress of desire from one object to another. This sounds more like a process rather than a state. Hobbes might see desire as something that drives us, but is it the definition of felicity?

Option H: the ability to control one's desires. That's more about self-control, which is virtue, but does that equate to felicity? I'm not certain.

Option I: a state of tranquility. Tranquility as happiness? Maybe, but I'm not sure if that's Hobbes' take.

Option J: a state of contemplation. Contemplation is more of a Platonic or Aristotelian idea, perhaps, not sure about Hobbes.

Now, trying to remember what I learned about Hobbes. He was a materialist and a determinist, I think. He believed that human nature is driven by desires and the pursuit of pleasure. In his view, people are rational and self-interested. Felicity, or happiness, would be the state where these desires are met, but without conflict.

Wait, in Hobbes' state of nature, life is "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." So in the absence of a social contract, people are in conflict. But when they form a society, they have order. So maybe felicity for Hobbes is when people can live without constant conflict, satisfying their desires within the structure of society.

But does that mean satisfaction with one's current state? Or is it more about the absence of desire?

Wait, in Hobbes' view, desires are natural and necessary. The Leviathan is the social contract that allows people to have a peaceful life. So maybe felicity is when you're satisfied with the current state because your desires are being fulfilled without constant competition.

Looking back at the options, E is "a state of satisfaction with one's current state." That seems to fit. Alternatively, G is about the continual progress of desires, which might align with the idea that desires are never fully satisfied but keep driving us. But I think Hobbes might see felicity as the state where you're content because your basic needs are met through society.

So, I'm leaning towards E being the correct answer.
