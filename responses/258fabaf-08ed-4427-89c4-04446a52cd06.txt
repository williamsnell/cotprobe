Okay, so I have this question about the corpus callosum and what happens when it's cut in a right-handed patient. Hmm, I remember that the corpus callosum is the bundle of nerves connecting the two hemispheres of the brain. If it's cut, it's called a corpus callosum transection or something like that. I think this affects how the two halves communicate.

Right-handed patients usually have their language centers in the left hemisphere. So if the corpus callosum is cut, the right hand, which is controlled by the left hemisphere, might not be able to communicate with the left hand or the other side. Wait, but the question is about what the patient can't do.

Looking at the options:

A: Cannot name objects in the right hand if they can see them. That doesn't sound right because if they can see, the visual info goes to the left hemisphere, which can name things. So maybe A is wrong.

B: Cannot recognize objects in the right hand. Recognition is more about the sensory cortex, and without the corpus callosum, maybe the left hemisphere can't send info to the right? Not sure.

C: Cannot name objects in the left hand if they can't see them. If they can't see, the left hand's sensory info goes to the right hemisphere. But if the corpus is cut, the right can't communicate with the left, so the left hemisphere (which handles language) can't help. So when the patient can't see, and the object is in the left hand, they can't name it because the right hemisphere can't send info to the left for language. So C might be correct.

D: Can't do well-learned tasks with the left hand. Well-learned tasks are usually in the cerebellum or motor cortex, but maybe without the corpus, the left hand can't get feedback from the right hemisphere. Not sure, but D seems possible.

E: Decline in verbal intelligence. Verbal is in the left hemisphere. If the corpus is cut, maybe the left can't send info to the right, but I don't think it directly affects verbal intelligence. So E might not be it.

F: Lose ability to speak. That's more like a stroke in Broca's area, not necessarily from corpus callosum cut. So F is probably wrong.

G: Can't name objects in the right hand if can't see them. If the patient can't see, and the object is in the right hand, which is left hemisphere controlled. Wait, no, the right hand is controlled by the left hemisphere, but if the corpus is cut, maybe the right hemisphere can't help. Wait, no, the right hand is in the left hemisphere. Hmm, maybe G is similar to C but with the right hand. But if the patient can't see, they rely on touch, which goes to the opposite side's sensory area. So if the object is in the right hand, the sensory info goes to the left hemisphere (since right hand sends to left). But if the corpus is cut, the left hemisphere can't communicate with the right. So if they can't see, but can feel, the left hemisphere knows, but can't send info to the right for processing? I'm getting confused.

Wait, the question is about naming objects. So for the right hand, if the patient can't see, they can still feel. But if the left hemisphere (which handles language) can't send info to the right hemisphere, maybe the patient can't name the object because the right hemisphere can't communicate the info back. So if the object is in the right hand and the patient can't see, they can feel it but can't name it because the right hemisphere (which can't send info) isn't connected to the left language area. So G would be the same as C but for the right hand. But the options are C and G.

Wait, the options are C: can't name objects in left hand if can't see them. G: can't name objects in right hand if can't see them. So which is correct?

Because in a right-handed person, the left hemisphere controls the right hand. If the corpus is cut, the right hemisphere can't communicate with the left. So when an object is in the left hand, the sensory info is sent to the right hemisphere (since left hand is processed in the right hemisphere). But without the corpus, the right hemisphere can't send that info to the left (language) hemisphere. So the patient can't name the object because the left hemisphere doesn't get the info from the right. So C is correct.

Wait, but when the patient can't see, they have to rely on touch. So if the object is in the left hand, the patient's right hemisphere gets the info, but can't send it to the left. So the left hemisphere, which handles language, doesn't know what the object is, so the patient can't name it. So C is correct.

Alternatively, G says if they can't see, can't name the right hand object. But the right hand is already in the left hemisphere's control, so the left hemisphere can process the touch info. Wait, no, because touch from the right hand goes to the left hemisphere. So if the corpus is cut, the left hemisphere can't send info to the right, but the left hemisphere itself can process the touch. So the patient can name the object because the left hemisphere has the info. So G is not correct.

So the correct answer is C.

When the corpus callosum is cut in a right-handed patient, the two hemispheres of the brain can no longer communicate effectively. This is particularly relevant for tasks that require integration of information between the hemispheres. In a right-handed individual, the left hemisphere typically controls language and motor functions for the right hand. If the corpus callosum is severed, the right hemisphere (which processes sensory information from the left hand) cannot send this information to the left hemisphere for language processing.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The patient can name objects in the right hand if they can see them because visual information is processed in the left hemisphere, which handles language.
- **B**: Incorrect. Recognition of objects is not directly affected by corpus callosum transection.
- **C**: Correct. If the patient cannot see an object in the left hand, the sensory information is processed in the right hemisphere. Without the corpus callosum, this information cannot reach the left hemisphere, which is responsible for language. Thus, the patient cannot name the object.
- **D**: Incorrect. Well-learned motor tasks with the left hand are not typically disrupted because these tasks are often controlled by the cerebellum and motor cortex, not the corpus callosum.
- **E**: Incorrect. Verbal intelligence is not directly affected by corpus callosum transection.
- **F**: Incorrect. The ability to speak is not lost unless there is damage to language centers, not just the corpus callosum.
- **G**: Incorrect. The patient can name objects in the right hand if they cannot see them because the left hemisphere processes both touch and language.
- **H**: Incorrect. Well-learned motor tasks with the right hand are not disrupted.
- **I**: Incorrect. Spatial intelligence is not directly affected by corpus callosum transection.
- **J**: Incorrect. The ability to write with the right hand is not lost unless there is damage to motor areas.

The correct answer is **C**, as the patient cannot name objects in the left hand if they cannot see them due to the inability of the right hemisphere to communicate with the left hemisphere for language processing.

Answer: C
