Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about peas. I remember that in peas, certain traits are dominant and recessive. The question involves two traits: height and cotyledon color. Tall is dominant (D) over dwarf (d), and yellow cotyledons (G) are dominant over green (g). 

The setup is that a tall, yellow plant was crossed with a tall, green plant. Their offspring showed 6 tall green, 5 tall yellow, 2 dwarf yellow, and 2 dwarf green plants. I need to figure out the genotypes of the parents.

First, let me list out the possible traits for each parent. Both parents are tall, so they must each have at least one D allele. One parent has yellow cotyledons (so GG or Gg), and the other has green cotyledons (so gg). 

Wait, no, wait. The first parent is tall and yellow, so its genotype for height is DD or Dd. For cotyledons, it's GG or Gg. The second parent is tall and green, so height is DD or Dd, but cotyledons are gg because green is recessive. So the second parent's genotype is something like D? for height and gg for cotyledons.

Looking at the offspring ratios, let's see: tall to dwarf. The total tall is 6 +5 =11, and dwarf is 2+2=4. So roughly 11:4, which is close to a 3:1 ratio. That suggests that for the height trait, the parents were probably Dd × Dd, because that would give a 3:1 ratio (DD:Dd:dd in a 1:2:1 ratio, but when tall is dominant, it's 3:1). 

Wait, but wait. Let me think. If the cross is Dd × Dd, the offspring would be 25% DD, 50% Dd, and 25% dd. But since tall is dominant, that's 75% tall and 25% dwarf, which is a 3:1 ratio. So in the offspring, 11 tall and 4 dwarf—so roughly 11/15 ≈73% tall, which fits the 3:1 ratio. So the height genes must be Dd × Dd. So both parents are Dd for height.

Now for the cotyledon color. The parents are one yellow (GG or Gg) and one green (gg). The offspring have both yellow and green cotyledons. The possible phenotypic ratio can help us find the genotypes.

The second parent is green (so genotype is gg) for cotyledons. The first parent is yellow (so could be GG or Gg). Let's look at the offspring's cotyledon colors.

The offspring have 6 green and 5 yellow in the tall group, and 2 green and 2 yellow in the dwarf group. So overall, green is 8 (6+2) and yellow is 7 (5+2). That's roughly a 1:1 ratio. Wait, but that's more like an equal split. If the parents were Gg × gg, then the expected phenotypic ratio would be 50% yellow (Gg) and 50% green (gg). But in the data, it's almost 1:1, but slightly more yellow. Hmm.

Wait, the actual numbers are 6 green, 5 yellow in tall, and 2 green, 2 yellow in dwarf. So total green is 8 and yellow is 7. So 8:7, which is almost 1:1. So this suggests that the cross is between Gg and gg for the cotyledon trait. Because when you cross Gg (yellow) with gg (green), the offspring are 50% Gg (yellow) and 50% gg (green). That would explain the almost 1:1 ratio.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The first parent is yellow, so if it's GG, then all offspring would be Gg (yellow). But if the first parent is Gg, then the offspring would have 50% Gg (yellow) and 50% gg (green), which is what we're seeing. 

So the first parent for cotyledons is Gg, and the second is gg. 

Putting it together, the parents' genotypes for height are Dd each, and for cotyledons, one is Gg and the other is gg. 

So parent 1 is DdGg (tall, yellow), and parent 2 is Ddgg (tall, green). Because the second parent is tall, so Dd. 

Wait, but let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option G is DdGg × Ddgg. So that would be parent 1: DdGg (tall, yellow), parent 2: Ddgg (tall, green).

Wait, but let me confirm. 

Parent 1: Dd × Dd for height → 25% DD, 50% Dd, 25% dd. But since they're tall, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1. So in the offspring, 11 tall and 4 dwarf, which matches.

For cotyledons: parent 1 is Gg, parent 2 is gg. So the cross is Gg × gg. The offspring would be 50% Gg (yellow) and 50% gg (green). So in the data, 11 plants for tall and 5 yellow, 6 green? Wait, no, the data is more like within each height category, the cotyledon colors are split.

Wait, the total tall plants are 6+5=11, and dwarf are 4. So let me look at the cotyledon data within each height group.

Wait, but the data is given as: 6 tall green, 5 tall yellow, 2 dwarf yellow, 2 dwarf green.

So for the tall plants (11), 6 have green cotyledons and 5 have yellow. That's roughly 6/11 (55%) green and 5/11 (45%) yellow. Hmm, that's more like a 6:5 ratio. That's not exactly 1:1. But considering the small sample size, maybe it's close enough.

Wait, but if the parents are DdGg × Ddgg, then for the height, each parent is Dd, so the cross is Dd × Dd, which gives 25% DD, 50% Dd, 25% dd. So the phenotypic ratio for height is 3:1, which matches the data (11 tall, 4 dwarf).

For cotyledons, parent 1 is Gg and parent 2 is gg. So the cross is Gg × gg → 50% Gg (yellow) and 50% gg (green). So the ratio should be 1:1 for cotyledon color. But in the data, the overall ratio is 7 yellow to 8 green, which is almost 1:1. So this seems to fit.

But looking at the options, option G is DdGg × Ddgg. So that's the first parent being DdGg (tall, yellow) and the second being Ddgg (tall, green). 

Wait, but the second parent is tall, so Dd. So yes, that makes sense.

Let me double-check other options. Option E is DDGg × Ddgg. So parent 1 would be DD for height (homozygous tall), and Gg for cotyledons. Parent 2 is Dd for height (so could be tall) and gg for cot. So for height, parent 1 is DD × parent 2 is Dd → DD × Dd cross. The offspring for height would be 50% DD and 50% Dd, all tall, since both are dominant. So in that case, all offspring would be tall. But in the data, there are dwarf plants (4), so this can't be the case. So option E is incorrect.

Option F: DDGg × ddGg. Wait, the second parent here is dd, which would be dwarf, but the problem states that both parents are tall. So option F is out.

Option H: DDgg × ddGg. Again, the second parent is dd, which can't be because both are tall. So H is out.

Option C: DdGg × DDgg. Parent 1 is Dd (tall) and Gg (yellow). Parent 2 is DD (tall) and gg (green). So for height, the cross is Dd × DD. The possible gametes are D and d from parent 1, and D from parent 2 (since DD can only give D). So the offspring would be 50% DD (tall) and 50% Dd (tall). So all offspring would be tall, but in the data, there are dwarfs. So C is incorrect.

Option I: DdGg × DDGg. Parent 1 is DdGg, parent 2 is DDGg. Both are tall, and parent 2 has yellow cot. But the second parent is supposed to have green cot, so this can't be right. So I is out.

Option D: Ddgg × DdGG. So parent 1 is Dd for height (tall) and gg for cot (green). Parent 2 is Dd (tall) and GG (yellow). So for cot, the cross is Gg × GG? Wait, no, parent 1 is gg, so the cross is Gg (from parent 2) × gg (parent 1). Wait, no: parent 1 is gg, so the cross is GG (from parent 2) × gg (parent 1). So for cot, all offspring would be Gg (yellow), because GG × gg would produce 100% Gg. But in the data, there are both yellow and green cotyledons. So D can't be correct.

Option A: ddGg × DdGG. But parent 1 is dd, which is dwarf, but the problem says both parents are tall. So A is out.

Option B: DDGG × ddgg. Parent 1 is DD (tall) and GG (yellow). Parent 2 is dd (dwarf) and gg (green). But both parents are supposed to be tall, so B is out.

Option J isn't listed, but the options given are up to I. So the correct answer must be G: DdGg × Ddgg.

The problem involves determining the genotypes of two tall pea plants, one with yellow cotyledons and the other with green cotyledons, based on the offspring's phenotypic ratios. In peas, tall (D) is dominant to dwarf (d), and yellow cotyledons (G) are dominant to green (g). The offspring data shows 6 tall, green; 5 tall, yellow; 2 dwarf, yellow; and 2 dwarf, green plants.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Height Trait (Tall vs. Dwarf):**
   - Both parents are tall, so their genotypes must include at least one dominant allele (D). 
   - The offspring ratio of tall to dwarf is approximately 11:4, which aligns with a 3:1 ratio expected from a Dd × Dd cross. Thus, both parents are heterozygous for height: **Dd**.

2. **Cotyledon Color (Yellow vs. Green):**
   - One parent has yellow cotyledons (dominant), and the other has green cotyledons (recessive). 
   - The offspring ratio of yellow to green cotyledons is approximately 7:8, which is nearly 1:1. This suggests a cross between a heterozygous (Gg) and homozygous recessive (gg) genotype for cotyledon color.

3. **Combining Genotypes:**
   - Parent 1: **DdGg** (tall, yellow).
   - Parent 2: **Ddgg** (tall, green).

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option G (DdGg × Ddgg):** Matches the analysis. Parent 1 is DdGg (tall, yellow), and Parent 2 is Ddgg (tall, green). This explains the observed phenotypic ratios for both traits.
- Other options are inconsistent with the data or the problem constraints (e.g., involving dwarf parents or incorrect phenotypic ratios).

### Conclusion:
The genotypes of the parents are **DdGg × Ddgg**.
