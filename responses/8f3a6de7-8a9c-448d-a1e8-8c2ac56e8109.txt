Okay, so I've got this probability problem here about carrot bag weights. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the problem says that the weight of a 1-pound bag of carrots follows a normal distribution, specifically N(1.18, 0.07²). That means the mean is 1.18 pounds and the variance is 0.07 squared. Similarly, a 3-pound bag has a distribution of N(3.22, 0.09²), so the mean is 3.22 pounds and variance is 0.09 squared. 

The question asks for the probability that the sum of three 1-pound bags exceeds the weight of one 3-pound bag. So, I need to find P(Y > W), where Y is the sum of three 1-pound bags and W is the weight of a single 3-pound bag.

Let me start by figuring out the distribution of Y, which is the sum of three independent 1-pound bags. Since each 1-pound bag has a mean (μ) of 1.18 and a standard deviation (σ) of 0.07, when I sum three of them, the mean of Y should be 3 times 1.18. Let me calculate that: 3 * 1.18 equals 3.54. So, the mean of Y is 3.54 pounds.

Now, for the variance of Y. Since the bags are independent, the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances. Each bag has a variance of 0.07², so three bags would have a variance of 3 * (0.07)². Let me compute that: 0.07 squared is 0.0049, and multiplied by 3 gives 0.0147. So, the variance of Y is 0.0147, and the standard deviation (σ_Y) would be the square root of that. Let me calculate that: sqrt(0.0147) ≈ 0.1212 pounds.

Next, I need to find the distribution of W, which is the 3-pound bag. It's given as N(3.22, 0.09²). So, the mean is 3.22 and the standard deviation is 0.09.

Now, the problem is to find P(Y > W). Since Y and W are independent (I assume they are because they're different bags), I can consider the difference between Y and W. Let me define a new random variable D = Y - W. Then, P(Y > W) is the same as P(D > 0).

To find the distribution of D, I'll subtract the distributions of Y and W. The mean of D will be the mean of Y minus the mean of W. So, that's 3.54 - 3.22 = 0.32. 

The variance of D is the sum of the variances of Y and W because when you subtract independent variables, the variances add. So, Var(D) = Var(Y) + Var(W). Var(Y) is 0.0147 and Var(W) is 0.09² = 0.0081. Adding them together: 0.0147 + 0.0081 = 0.0228. Therefore, the standard deviation of D is sqrt(0.0228) ≈ 0.1510.

So, D follows a normal distribution with mean 0.32 and standard deviation 0.1510. I need to find P(D > 0). 

To calculate this probability, I'll standardize D. The Z-score for D=0 is (0 - 0.32)/0.1510 ≈ -2.12. 

Now, I need to find the probability that a standard normal variable is greater than -2.12. Alternatively, since the standard normal table gives the area to the left, I can find P(Z > -2.12) = 1 - P(Z ≤ -2.12). 

Looking up -2.12 in the Z-table, I remember that P(Z ≤ -2.12) is approximately 0.0168. So, 1 - 0.0168 = 0.9832. 

Wait, but let me double-check that Z-score calculation. D has mean 0.32, so when D is 0, Z = (0 - 0.32)/0.1510 ≈ -2.12. Hmm, that seems right. 

Alternatively, maybe I should use more precise values. Let me calculate sqrt(0.0228) more accurately. 0.0228 is 228/10000, so sqrt(0.0228) ≈ 0.1510. So, the Z-score is indeed about -2.12. 

Looking at standard normal distribution tables, a Z-score of -2.12 corresponds to a cumulative probability of about 0.0168. So, the probability that D is greater than 0 is 1 - 0.0168 = 0.9832. 

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 0.9832. The closest is option G: 0.9830. That must be the correct answer. 

Alternatively, maybe I should check my calculations again to ensure I didn't make any errors. Let me go through each step once more.

1. Y is the sum of three 1-pound bags. Each has mean 1.18, so 3*1.18=3.54. Correct. Var(Y)=3*(0.07)^2=3*0.0049=0.0147. Correct. So σ_Y=√0.0147≈0.1212. Correct.

2. W has mean 3.22 and σ=0.09. Correct.

3. D = Y - W. Mean is 3.54 - 3.22 = 0.32. Correct. Var(D)=Var(Y)+Var(W)=0.0147+0.0081=0.0228. Correct. So σ_D=√0.0228≈0.1510. Correct.

4. P(D>0)=P(Z>(0 - 0.32)/0.1510)=P(Z>-2.12)=1 - P(Z≤-2.12). Correct.

5. P(Z≤-2.12)= approximately 0.0168. So 1 - 0.0168=0.9832. The options have G:0.9830, which is very close. So the answer should be G.
