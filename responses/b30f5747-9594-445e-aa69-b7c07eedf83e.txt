Okay, so I have this question about Binge Eating Disorder (BED), and I need to figure out which statement is incorrect. Let's break it down step by step.

The question is asking what is incorrect about BED. The options are A, B, and C. I remember that BED is a disorder where people eat large amounts of food in a short period, often feeling out of control, and usually experience feelings of shame or guilt afterward. It's different from Bulimia Nervosa (BN) because BN involves both bingeing and purging, whereas BED doesn't typically have the purging aspect.

Looking at option A: "BED patients have higher odds of developing obesity." I think this is correct because BED often leads to weight gain over time since there's no compensatory behavior like vomiting or laxative use. So A is a correct statement, meaning it's not the incorrect one we're looking for.

Option B: "Binge Eating episodes in BED are usually richer in calories than those of BN, leading patients to obesity." Hmm, I'm a bit unsure here. I know that both BED and BN involve bingeing, but BN patients might eat similar types of food but then purge. In BED, people don't purge, so the calories would stay in the body. But does the content of the binge differ? I'm not sure, but I think that BED binge episodes might actually be similar in calorie density to BN's. Wait, no, maybe in BN, they might eat more to compensate, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps BED episodes are more about quantity rather than high-calorie density. Wait, I think that the content might not necessarily be richer in calories; it's more about the amount consumed regardless of the type. So maybe B is incorrect because the calorie richness isn't necessarily higher, leading to the incorrect statement that it leads to obesity.

Option C: "Spontaneous remission is a possible outcome." I remember that some people with BED do experience remission without formal treatment. So C is correct, meaning it's not the incorrect answer.

So putting it together, the incorrect statement is option B because the calorie richness of the episodes isn't necessarily higher in BED than BN. BED leads to obesity because of the lack of purging, not necessarily because the food is higher in calories than BN's binge episodes.

The incorrect statement about Binge Eating Disorder (BED) is that binge episodes in BED are usually richer in calories than those of Bulimia Nervosa (BN), leading to obesity. This is not necessarily true, as the calorie content of binge episodes in BED is not inherently higher. Instead, BED leads to obesity due to the lack of compensatory behaviors like purging.

Answer: B
