Okay, so I've got this problem about Comet Halley's orbit. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these orbital mechanics concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says that Comet Halley moves in an elliptical orbit around the sun. The distances at perihelion and aphelion are given as 8.75 ×10^7 km and 5.26 ×10^9 km, respectively. I need to find its orbital period, which is given as X ×10^9 seconds. So, I have to find the value of X.

Hmm, I remember that Kepler's laws are involved here. Specifically, Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period of a planet (or a comet) to the semi-major axis of its orbit. The formula I think is T² = (4π²/GM) * a³, where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the sun, and a is the semi-major axis.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I remember the exact formula. Alternatively, I think there's a version of Kepler's third law that's often used in astronomical units, which simplifies things because it's based on the Earth's orbit as a reference. Oh right, in those units, the formula is T² = a³, where T is in Earth years and a is in astronomical units (AU). But wait, in this problem, the distances are given in kilometers, so maybe I should stick to the SI units.

Let me get the formula correct. The general form of Kepler's third law is T² = (4π² * a³) / (G*M), where a is the semi-major axis in meters, T is the period in seconds, G is the gravitational constant (6.674×10^-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2), and M is the mass of the sun (approximately 1.989×10^30 kg).

So first, I need to find the semi-major axis a. Since the orbit is elliptical, the semi-major axis is the average of the perihelion and aphelion distances. Wait, no, that's not quite right. The perihelion (closest approach) and aphelion (farthest point) are the two extremes of the orbit. The semi-major axis is indeed the average of these two distances because, in an ellipse, the major axis is the longest diameter, and the semi-major axis is half of that. So a = (r_peri + r_aph) / 2.

Wait, let me confirm that. Yes, because the perihelion and aphelion are the points where the comet is closest and farthest from the sun. The semi-major axis is the average of these two. So, I'll calculate that.

Let me compute the values. The perihelion is 8.75e7 km, and the aphelion is 5.26e9 km. Let me convert these to meters because the units in the formula are in meters and seconds.

So, 8.75 ×10^7 km = 8.75e7 × 1e3 meters = 8.75e10 meters. Similarly, 5.26e9 km = 5.26e9 ×1e3 = 5.26e12 meters.

Now, a is (8.75e10 + 5.26e12) / 2. Let me compute that:

First, add the two numbers. But wait, 8.75e10 is 0.0875e12, and 5.26e12 is 5.26e12. So adding them together gives 5.26e12 + 0.0875e12 = 5.3475e12 meters.

Divide by 2: a = 5.3475e12 / 2 = 2.67375e12 meters.

Wait, let me check that calculation again. Wait, 8.75e7 km = 8.75 *1e7 *1e3 m = 8.75 *1e10 m = 8.75e10 m. 5.26e9 km is 5.26e9 *1e3 m = 5.26e12 m. So sum is 5.26e12 + 8.75e10 = 5.26e12 + 0.0875e12 = 5.3475e12 m. Divide by 2: 5.3475e12 / 2 = 2.67375e12 meters. So a ≈ 2.67375e12 m.

Now, using Kepler's third law: T² = (4π² * a³) / (G*M).

Let me plug in the numbers. G is 6.674e-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2, and M is 1.989e30 kg.

So, let's compute a³ first. a = 2.67375e12 m. a³ is (2.67375e12)^3.

Calculating that: (2.67375)^3 ≈ 19.23 (since 2.67^3 is about 19, but I'll compute it more accurately). 2.67375 * 2.67375 = let's see, 2.67 * 2.67 is approximately 7.1289, and then multiply by 2.67375 again. Alternatively, using a calculator approach:

But perhaps I can approximate this since exact calculation might be time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I can compute a³ as (2.67375e12)^3 = (2.67375)^3 * (1e12)^3 = 19.23 * 1e36 = 1.923e37 m³.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that exact number. Let me compute 2.67375^3 more accurately:

2.67375 * 2.67375 = ?

First, 2 * 2 =4.

2 * 0.67375 = 1.3475.

0.67375 * 2 = 1.3475.

0.67375 * 0.67375 ≈ 0.4538.

So adding all: 4 + 1.3475 +1.3475 + 0.4538 = 7.1488.

Wait wait, that's 2.67375 squared. Then multiply by 2.67375 again.

So 7.1488 * 2.67375 ≈ ?

Let me compute 7 * 2.67375 = 18.71625.

0.1488 * 2.67375 ≈ 0.1488 *2 = 0.2976, 0.1488*0.67375≈ 0.1004. So total ≈ 0.2976 + 0.1004 = 0.398.

So total is approximately 18.71625 + 0.398 ≈ 19.114 m³.

So a³ = (2.67375e12)^3 ≈ 19.114e36 m³ = 1.9114e37 m³.

Now, 4π² is approximately (4 * (9.8696)) ≈ 39.4784.

So numerator is 4π² * a³ = 39.4784 * 1.9114e37 ≈ let's compute that.

39.4784 * 1.9114 ≈ approximately 39.4784 * 2 =78.9568, but since it's 1.9114, which is about 0.0886 less than 2, so 39.4784 *0.0886 ≈ 3.502. So 78.9568 -3.502 ≈75.4548. So the numerator is approximately 75.4548e37 =7.54548e38.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 39.4784 *1.9114e37 is 39.4784 *1.9114 multiplied by 1e37. So 39.4784 *1.9114 ≈ let me compute accurately:

39.4784 *1.9114. Let me do this step by step.

First, 39 * 1.9114 = 74.5446.

0.4784 *1.9114 ≈ let's compute 0.4 *1.9114=0.76456, 0.0784 *1.9114≈0.1501. So total ≈0.76456 +0.1501=0.91466.

So total is 74.5446 +0.91466 ≈75.45926.

So 4π² *a³ ≈75.45926e37 =7.545926e38.

Denominator is G*M =6.674e-11 *1.989e30.

Compute that: 6.674e-11 *1.989e30 = (6.674 *1.989) *1e( -11 +30 )= let's compute 6.674 *1.989.

6 *1.989 =11.934.

0.674 *1.989 ≈ 1.340.

So total is about 11.934 +1.340 =13.274.

So G*M ≈13.274e19 =1.3274e20.

So now, T² = numerator / denominator =7.545926e38 /1.3274e20 ≈ let's compute that.

7.545926e38 /1.3274e20 = (7.545926 /1.3274) * 1e(38-20) )= (7.545926/1.3274) *1e18.

Compute 7.545926 ÷1.3274:

Let me approximate. 1.3274 *5.67 = let's see:

1.3274 *5=6.637.

1.3274 *0.67≈0.890.

So 6.637 +0.890≈7.527. That's close to 7.5459. So 5.67 gives us about 7.527, which is just a bit less than 7.5459. The difference is 7.5459 -7.527=0.0189.

So each 0.01 in the multiplier adds about 0.013274 to the product. So 0.0189 /0.013274 ≈1.424. So the multiplier is approximately 5.67 + 0.01424 ≈5.68424.

So 7.5459/1.3274≈5.68424.

So T² ≈5.68424e18 s².

Therefore, T = sqrt(5.68424e18) s.

Compute sqrt(5.68424e18) = sqrt(5.68424) *1e9 s.

What's sqrt(5.68424)? Let me think: 2.38²=5.6644, because 2.38*2.38=5.6644. 2.39²=5.7121. So 5.68424 is between 2.38 and 2.39.

Let me compute 2.38²=5.6644.

Difference: 5.68424 -5.6644=0.01984.

Each 0.01 increase in the number adds approximately 2*2.38*0.01 + (0.01)^2 ≈0.0476 +0.0001=0.0477 to the square.

So 0.01984 /0.0477≈0.415. So sqrt(5.68424)≈2.38 + 0.00415≈2.38415.

So T≈2.38415e9 seconds.

Wait, let me check that calculation again. Because I think I might have made a mistake in the approximation.

Wait, let me compute 2.38²=5.6644.

2.38415²: Let's compute (2.38 +0.00415)² =2.38² + 2*2.38*0.00415 + (0.00415)^2.

So 5.6644 + 2*2.38*0.00415 = 5.6644 + (4.76 *0.00415) ≈5.6644 + 0.01974≈5.68414.

Then plus (0.00415)^2≈0.0000172. So total is approx 5.684157. Which is very close to 5.68424. So sqrt(5.68424)≈2.38415.

So T≈2.38415e9 seconds. Therefore, X is approximately 2.384.

Looking at the options, option J is 2.38, which matches this value. So X=2.38, which is option J.

To determine the orbital period of Comet Halley, we use Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period \( T \) to the semi-major axis \( a \) of the orbit. The semi-major axis is the average of the perihelion and aphelion distances:

\[
a = \frac{r_{\text{peri}} + r_{\text{aphelion}}}{2}
\]

Given \( r_{\text{peri}} = 8.75 \times 10^7 \, \text{km} \) and \( r_{\text{aphelion}} = 5.26 \times 10^9 \, \text{km} \), we convert these to meters:

\[
r_{\text{peri}} = 8.75 \times 10^{10} \, \text{m}, \quad r_{\text{aphelion}} = 5.26 \times 10^{12} \, \text{m}
\]

\[
a = \frac{8.75 \times 10^{10} + 5.26 \times 10^{12}}{2} = 2.67375 \times 10^{12} \, \text{m}
\]

Using Kepler's third law in SI units:

\[
T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 a^3}{G M}
\]

where \( G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \, \text{kg}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-2} \) and \( M = 1.989 \times 10^{30} \, \text{kg} \). First, calculate \( a^3 \):

\[
a^3 = (2.67375 \times 10^{12})^3 = 1.9114 \times 10^{37} \, \text{m}^3
\]

Next, compute the numerator \( 4\pi^2 a^3 \):

\[
4\pi^2 \approx 39.4784, \quad 4\pi^2 a^3 = 39.4784 \times 1.9114 \times 10^{37} \approx 7.5459 \times 10^{38}
\]

Now, calculate the denominator \( G M \):

\[
G M = (6.674 \times 10^{-11}) \times (1.989 \times 10^{30}) \approx 1.3274 \times 10^{20}
\]

Divide to find \( T^2 \):

\[
T^2 = \frac{7.5459 \times 10^{38}}{1.3274 \times 10^{20}} \approx 5.6842 \times 10^{18} \, \text{s}^2
\]

Take the square root to find \( T \):

\[
T = \sqrt{5.6842 \times 10^{18}} \approx 2.384 \times 10^9 \, \text{s}
\]

Thus, \( X \approx 2.38 \), corresponding to option **J**.
