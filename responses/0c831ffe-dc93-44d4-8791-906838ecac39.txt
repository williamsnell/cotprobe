Okay, so I've got this question about forward contracts on a stock. Hmm, I need to find the forward price F. Let me think about what I remember from my studies.

The question says it's a forward contract on a non-dividend paying stock. Oh right, I think non-dividend paying stocks are simpler because there's no income generated from dividends. That probably affects the calculation somehow.

The stock's current price is $50, and the time to maturity is 6 months. The interest rate is 4% per annum. Wait, so 6 months is half a year, so the rate would be 4% divided by 2, which is 2% for the 6-month period. But wait, is it continuously compounded or simple interest? I think for forward prices, we usually use the risk-free rate, and it's typically simple interest because the formula for forward price is S0 * e^(rT) when continuous, or S0*(1 + r*T) when simple. Wait, but wait, no, the standard formula for forward price when there are no dividends and when using simple interest is F = S0 * e^(rT) or F = S0*(1 + r*T) if using simple? Or maybe it's F = S0 * e^{(r)(T)} when using continuous, but if the rate is given as annual and time is 6 months, maybe we can just compute it as F = S0 * (1 + r*T), where T is in years.

Let me clarify: The formula for the forward price when there are no dividends is F = S0 * e^{(r)(T)}, assuming continuous compounding. But sometimes, depending on the context, it's given as F = S0 * (1 + r*T) if using simple interest. But wait, in this problem, the rate is given as 4% per annum, so it's likely using continuous compounding because forward prices typically use the continuously compounded rate. Or wait, maybe not; maybe it's just the simple rate. Hmm.

Wait, another way: The forward price for a non-dividend stock is calculated as F = S0 * e^{rT}, where r is the risk-free rate and T is time in years. Alternatively, sometimes when using the simple interest formula, it's F = S0 * (1 + r*T). Let me check which applies here.

So given that the interest rate is 4% per annum, and T is 0.5 years because it's 6 months. So if using the continuous formula, r*T would be 0.04 * 0.5 = 0.02. Then e^0.02 is approximately 1.0202. So F would be 50 * 1.0202 â‰ˆ 51.01. Looking at the options, B is 51.0, which is close. Alternatively, if using simple interest, F = 50 * (1 + 0.04 * 0.5) = 50 * 1.02 = 51.0, exactly. So either way, it's 51.0.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the forward contract uses the continuously compounded rate. So maybe I should double-check the formula. The standard formula for a forward contract without dividends is indeed F = S0 * e^{(r)(T)}, but the rate r should be the continuously compounded rate. If the given rate is the annually compounded rate, then we might have to adjust it. Wait, but in this question, the interest rate is given as 4% per annum, but it's not specified whether it's continuous or simple. Hmm, that's a point of confusion.

Wait, the problem states the 6-month interest rate is 4% per annum. Oh wait, no, the 6-month interest rate is 4% per annum? Or is it 4% per annum for 6 months? Wait, no, 6-month interest rate is 4% per annum. That's a bit ambiguous. Let me clarify: If the 6-month risk-free rate is 4% per annum, that's 2% for 6 months (since 4% is annual, so 4% / 2 = 2% for 6 months). So using simple interest, F = S0*(1 + r*T) would be 50*(1 + 0.04*(0.5)) = 50 *1.02 = 51.0, which is option B. Alternatively, if it's continuously compounded, then r is the continuous rate. Wait, but if the 6-month rate is 4% per annum, that's the simple rate, so r is 4% per annum for 6 months, or 2% effective for 6 months. So in that case, using simple interest, the forward price is 51.0.

Alternatively, if the rate is given as the continuously compounded rate, but I think in this question, the rate is the simple rate. So I think the answer is B, 51.0.

The forward price for a non-dividend-paying stock can be calculated using the formula \( F = S_0 \times (1 + r \times T) \), where \( S_0 \) is the current stock price, \( r \) is the interest rate, and \( T \) is the time to maturity in years. Given \( S_0 = 50 \), \( r = 4\% \) per annum, and \( T = 0.5 \) years, the calculation is:

\[
F = 50 \times (1 + 0.04 \times 0.5) = 50 \times 1.02 = 51.0
\]

Thus, the forward price is $51.0.
