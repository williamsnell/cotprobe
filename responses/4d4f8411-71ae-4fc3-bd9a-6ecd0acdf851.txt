Question:

Construct a complete truth table for the following argument. Then, using the truth table, determine whether the argument is valid or invalid. If the argument is invalid, choose an option which presents a counterexample. (There may be other counterexamples as well.)
(O ≡ P) ∨ P / P ∨ ~O

Options:

A: Invalid. Counterexample when O is true and P is true
B: Invalid. Counterexample when O and P are false
C: Invalid. Counterexample when P is false and O is false
D: Invalid. Counterexample when both O and P are simultaneously true and false
E: Invalid. Counterexample when O and P are true
F: Invalid. Counterexample when O is true and P is false
G: Invalid. Counterexample when P is false and O is true
H: Invalid. Counterexample when P is true and O is false
I: Valid

Okay, I need to figure out whether the argument (O ≡ P) ∨ P / P ∨ ~O is valid or invalid. Let me start by constructing a truth table for the premises and the conclusion.

First, the argument has two propositions: O and P. So, there are four possible truth value combinations: both true, both false, O true and P false, and O false and P true.

The premise is (O ≡ P) ∨ P. Let's break that down. The equivalence O ≡ P is true when both O and P are the same. Then, we take that result and OR it with P. So, if either (O ≡ P) is true or P is true, the premise is true.

The conclusion is P ∨ ~O. This is true if either P is true or O is false.

I'll make a table with all combinations:

1. O=T, P=T
   - O ≡ P = T
   - Premise: T ∨ T = T
   - ~O = F, so conclusion: T ∨ F = T
   - Premise=T, Conclusion=T → OK

2. O=T, P=F
   - O ≡ P = F (since O=T and P=F)
   - Premise: F ∨ F = F (since P=F)
   - Conclusion: P=F, ~O=F → F ∨ F = F
   - Premise=F, Conclusion=F → OK

Wait, no. Wait, in the premise, (O ≡ P) is F, and P is F, so (F ∨ F) would be F. So premise is F. Conclusion is P ∨ ~O → F ∨ F = F. So in this case, when premise is F, conclusion is F. That's not a counterexample because for the argument to be invalid, we need a case where premise is T and conclusion is F.

3. O=F, P=T
   - O ≡ P: F ≡ T = F
   - Premise: F ∨ T = T
   - Conclusion: T ∨ ~F → T ∨ T = T
   - So premise=T, conclusion=T → OK

4. O=F, P=F
   - O ≡ P: F ≡ F = T
   - Premise: T ∨ F = T
   - Conclusion: F ∨ ~F → F ∨ T = T
   - So premise=T, conclusion=T → OK

Wait, so in all cases where the premise is T, the conclusion is also T. So the argument seems valid because there's no case where premise is T and conclusion is F. So the argument is valid, which would make option I correct.

Wait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in evaluating the premise in the second case.

Wait, when O=T and P=F:

Premise: (O≡P) ∨ P → (F) ∨ F = F. So premise is F. Conclusion is P ∨ ~O → F ∨ F = F. So premise is F and conclusion is F. No problem for validity. So the only cases where premise is T are when O≡P is T or P is T.

Wait, another way: (O ≡ P) is equivalent to (O → P) ∧ (P → O). So (O≡P) ∨ P is equivalent to (O→P ∧ P→O) ∨ P. But maybe that's complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps I can see if the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premise. If whenever the premise is true, the conclusion is true, the argument is valid.

From the truth table, whenever premise is T, conclusion is T. So the argument is valid.

The argument is valid because in all cases where the premise is true, the conclusion is also true. Therefore, the argument holds.
