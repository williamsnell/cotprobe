Okay, so I have this problem here where a car gets 24 miles per gallon, and I need to find out how many gallons it would take to travel 144 miles. Hmm, let's see. I think I should start by understanding what miles per gallon means. It's like the car can go 24 miles on one gallon of gas. So, if I have that, I can figure out how many gallons are needed for a longer distance.

Alright, the question is asking for the gallons needed for 144 miles. So, I guess I need to divide the total miles by the miles per gallon to get the gallons required. Let me write that down: gallons = total miles / miles per gallon. Plugging in the numbers, that would be 144 miles divided by 24 mpg.

Wait, let me make sure I'm doing this right. If the car goes 24 miles on one gallon, then for each gallon, you add 24 miles. So, how many times does 24 go into 144? Let me do the division. 24 times 6 is 144 because 24*5 is 120, and 24*6 is 144. So, 144 divided by 24 is 6. That means the car would need 6 gallons to travel 144 miles.

Looking at the options, option J is 6 gallons. So, that should be the correct answer. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If the car uses 6 gallons at 24 mpg, then 6 gallons * 24 mpg = 144 miles. Yep, that adds up. I think I'm confident with that.

The car's fuel efficiency is 24 miles per gallon. To find the gallons needed for 144 miles, divide 144 by 24, which equals 6 gallons. Option J is the correct answer.
