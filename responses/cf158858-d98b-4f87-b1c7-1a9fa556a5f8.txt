Question:

World Bank data show that in 1995, the poorest 20% of households accounted for 7.5% of household income in Niger, the next 20% of households accounted for 11.8% of income, the middle 20% accounted for 15.5% of income, the second richest 20% accounted for 21.1% of income, and the top 20% accounted for 44.1% of income. What was the cumulative income share of the bottom 60% of households in Niger?

Options:

A: 48.10%
B: 34.80%
C: 44.10%
D: 56.40%
E: 7.50%
F: 29.60%
G: 21.10%
H: 11.80%
I: 15.50%
J: 65.20%

Okay, so I have this question about income distribution in Niger based on World Bank data from 1995. The question is asking for the cumulative income share of the bottom 60% of households. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to understand what cumulative income share means. From what I remember, cumulative income share refers to the total percentage of income that a certain portion of the population holds. So, in this case, they're asking for the total income that the poorest 60% of households account for.

The data provided breaks down the income distribution into five quintiles, each representing 20% of households. The shares are as follows:

- Poorest 20%: 7.5%
- Next 20%: 11.8%
- Middle 20%: 15.5%
- Second richest 20%: 21.1%
- Top 20%: 44.1%

So, the bottom 60% would consist of the first three quintiles: the poorest 20%, the next 20%, and the middle 20%. To find the cumulative income share, I need to add up their percentages.

Let me add them step by step. First, the poorest 20% is 7.5%. Then, the next 20% adds 11.8%, so 7.5 + 11.8 = 19.3%. Adding the middle 20%, which is 15.5%, gives me 19.3 + 15.5 = 34.8%.

Wait, let me double-check that addition to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 7.5 plus 11.8 is indeed 19.3. Then 19.3 plus 15.5 is 34.8. So the total cumulative income share for the bottom 60% is 34.8%.

Looking at the options provided, option B is 34.80%. So that should be the correct answer.

The cumulative income share is calculated by adding the percentages of the first three quintiles: 7.5% + 11.8% + 15.5% = 34.8%.

Answer: B
