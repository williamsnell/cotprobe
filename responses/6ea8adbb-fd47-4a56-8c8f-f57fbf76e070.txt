Question:

An eager AP Biology student interested in studying osmosis and the movement of water in solutions took a dialysis bag containing a 0.5 M solution and placed it into a beaker containing a 0.6 M solution. Which of the following is true about water potential?

Options:

A: An eager AP Biology student interested in studying osmosis and the movement of water in solutions took a dialysis bag containing a 0.5 M solution and placed it into a beaker containing a 0.6 M solution. It drives the movement of water from a region of lower water potential to a region of higher water potential.
B: Solute potential is the only factor that determines the water potential.
C: Pressure potential combines with solute potential to determine the water potential.
D: Water potential always drives water from an area of lower pressure potential to an area of higher pressure potential.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this biology question about osmosis and water potential. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: An AP Biology student puts a dialysis bag with a 0.5 M solution into a beaker with a 0.6 M solution. We need to determine which statement about water potential is true.

The options are A to D. Let's break them down.

First, I remember that water potential (Ψ) is a measure of the potential energy of water to move. It's determined by solute potential (Ψs) and pressure potential (Ψp). The formula is Ψ = Ψs + Ψp.

In this case, the dialysis bag has a lower concentration (0.5 M) compared to the beaker (0.6 M). So, the solution inside the bag has a higher water potential because when solute concentration is lower, water potential is higher. The beaker has a lower water potential because the solute is higher.

Water moves from higher to lower water potential. So in this setup, water should move out of the bag into the beaker because the bag has higher water potential (lower solute concentration) than the surrounding solution.

Looking at the options:

A: It says water moves from lower to higher water potential. Wait, no. Water moves from higher to lower Ψ. So this statement is incorrect. So A is wrong.

B: Solute potential is the only factor. No, because pressure potential also plays a role. So B is incorrect.

C: Pressure potential combines with solute potential. Yes, that's correct. Ψ = Ψs + Ψp. So C is correct.

D: Water moves based on pressure potential alone. No, because water also considers solute concentration. So D is incorrect.

So the correct answer must be C.

The correct answer is C: Pressure potential combines with solute potential to determine the water potential.

Answer: C
