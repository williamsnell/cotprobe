Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the eigenvalues of a given matrix A. The matrix A is a 3x3 matrix with entries [[3, 1, 1], [2, 4, 2], [1, 1, 3]]. The question gives me multiple-choice options, and I need to pick the correct one. Hmm, I remember that eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation, which is det(A - λI) = 0, where λ represents the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix of the same size as A.

First, I think I should write down the matrix (A - λI). So, subtracting λ from the diagonal elements of A. That would look like:

[3-λ, 1,     1   ]
[2,   4-λ,  2   ]
[1,   1,    3-λ ]

Next, I need to compute the determinant of this matrix. The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be a bit tedious, but I'll take it step by step. The formula for the determinant is:

|A - λI| = (3-λ) * [(4-λ)(3-λ) - (2)(1)] - 1 * [2*(3-λ) - 2*1] + 1 * [2*1 - (4-λ)*1]

Wait, alternatively, maybe I should expand along the first row for easier calculation.

So, expanding along the first row:

(3-λ) multiplied by the determinant of the submatrix:
[ (4-λ, 2), (1, 3-λ) ]
That determinant would be (4-λ)(3-λ) - 2*1.

Then subtract 1 times the determinant of another submatrix, which is:
[2, 2; 1, 3-λ], so determinant is 2*(3-λ) - 2*1.

Then add 1 times the determinant of the third submatrix:
[2, 4-λ; 1, 1], which is 2*1 - (4-λ)*1.

Putting it all together:

det(A - λI) = (3-λ)[(4-λ)(3-λ) - 2] - 1[2(3-λ) - 2] + 1[2 - (4-λ)].

Let me compute each part step by step.

First term: (3-λ)[(4-λ)(3-λ) - 2]
Compute (4-λ)(3-λ) first: that's 12 -4λ -3λ + λ² = λ² -7λ +12.
Subtract 2: λ² -7λ +12 - 2 = λ² -7λ +10.
Multiply by (3-λ): (3-λ)(λ² -7λ +10).
Let me expand that:
3*(λ² -7λ +10) = 3λ² -21λ +30
-λ*(λ² -7λ +10) = -λ³ +7λ² -10λ
So combining these: -λ³ +10λ² -31λ +30.

Second term: -1[2(3-λ) -2] = -1[6 -2λ -2] = -1[4 -2λ] = -4 +2λ.

Third term: +1[2 - (4-λ)] = 1[2-4 +λ] = 1[-2 +λ] = λ -2.

Now, add all three parts together:

(-λ³ +10λ² -31λ +30) + (-4 +2λ) + (λ -2)
Combine like terms:
-λ³ +10λ² + (-31λ +2λ +λ) + (30 -4 -2)
Simplify each:
-λ³ +10λ² -28λ +24.

So the characteristic equation is -λ³ +10λ² -28λ +24 = 0.

I can multiply both sides by -1 to make it easier: λ³ -10λ² +28λ -24 = 0.

Now, I need to find the roots of this cubic equation. Let me try possible integer roots using the Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots are factors of 24 over 1, so ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±6, ±8, ±12, ±24.

Let me test λ=1: 1 -10 +28 -24 = (1-10)= -9 +28=19 -24= -5 ≠0.

λ=2: 8 -40 +56 -24 = (8-40)=-32 +56=24 -24=0. Yes, λ=2 is a root.

So I can factor out (λ-2) from the cubic. Let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.

Using synthetic division with root 2:

Coefficients: 1 | -10 | 28 | -24

Bring down 1.

Multiply by 2: 1*2=2. Add to next coefficient: -10 +2 =-8.

Multiply by 2: -8*2=-16. Add to next coefficient:28 +(-16)=12.

Multiply by 2: 12*2=24. Add to next coefficient: -24 +24=0. Perfect.

So the cubic factors into (λ-2)(λ² -8λ +12).

Now, factor the quadratic: λ² -8λ +12.

Looking for two numbers that multiply to 12 and add to -8. Those would be -6 and -2.

So it factors into (λ-6)(λ-2).

Thus, the characteristic equation is (λ-2)(λ-6)(λ-2) =0. So the eigenvalues are λ=2 (with multiplicity 2) and λ=6.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the factoring of the quadratic. Because (λ-6)(λ-2) gives λ² -8λ +12. Yes, that's correct.

So the eigenvalues are 2, 2, and 6. So the set of eigenvalues is {2, 6} but with 2 repeated. But looking at the options, none of them list [2,6] with multiplicity. Wait the options are sets, not considering multiplicity. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: [3,1]
B: [2,6]
C: [1,4,5]
D: [1,2]
E: [0,2,4]
F: [4,2,3]
G: [3,4,5]
H: [3,4]
I: [6,2,3]
J: [5,3,1]

Wait, option B is [2,6], which includes both eigenvalues. But wait, the eigenvalues are 2 (twice) and 6. So the distinct eigenvalues are 2 and 6. So option B is [2,6], which is correct as the eigenvalues.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check my determinant calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate the determinant step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Matrix A - λI is:
[3-λ, 1, 1]
[2, 4-λ,2]
[1,1,3-λ]

Compute determinant using the first row expansion:

(3-λ) * det[[4-λ, 2], [1, 3-λ]] 
- 1 * det[[2, 2], [1, 3-λ]] 
+ 1 * det[[2,4-λ], [1,1]]

Compute each minor:

First minor: (4-λ)(3-λ) - (2)(1) = (12 -7λ + λ²) -2 = λ² -7λ +10.

Second minor: 2*(3-λ) - 2*1 = 6 -2λ -2 =4 -2λ.

Third minor: 2*1 - (4-λ)*1 = 2 -4 +λ = λ -2.

So the determinant is:

(3-λ)(λ² -7λ +10) -1*(4-2λ) +1*(λ-2)

Expanding (3-λ)(λ²-7λ+10):

3λ² -21λ +30 -λ³ +7λ² -10λ
Which is -λ³ +10λ² -31λ +30.

Then subtract (4-2λ): -4 +2λ.

Add (λ-2): +λ -2.

So total determinant:

-λ³ +10λ² -31λ +30 -4 +2λ +λ -2
Combine like terms:

-λ³ +10λ² + (-31λ +2λ +λ) + (30-4-2)
Which is -λ³ +10λ² -28λ +24.

So the characteristic equation is -λ³ +10λ² -28λ +24=0, same as before.

Then factoring out (λ-2), getting quadratic λ²-8λ+12, which factors into (λ-6)(λ-2).

So eigenvalues are 2,2,6.

Thus, the correct eigenvalues are 2 and 6, so option B is [2,6]. So the answer should be option B.
