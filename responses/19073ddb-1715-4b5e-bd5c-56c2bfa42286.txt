Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about calculating the cost of insurance policies for Montgomery's Department Store. There are three parts to the question: the cost for three consecutive one-year policies, the cost for a single three-year policy, and the difference between the two.

First, I'll try to understand the given information. The store insured a building for $30,000 at a rate of $2.50 per $1,000. That means the insurance cost is calculated based on the amount insured. So, I think the first step is to find out the annual cost for one year.

Wait, the building is insured for $30,000, and the rate is $2.50 per $1,000. So, for each $1,000 of coverage, it's $2.50. So, to find the total cost for one year, I need to multiply the rate by the number of thousands in $30,000.

So, $30,000 divided by $1,000 equals 30. That means there are 30 units of $1,000. Each unit costs $2.50, so 30 times $2.50. Let me calculate that: 30 * 2.50 equals $75. So, the annual cost is $75.

Now, the first part of the question asks for the cost of three consecutive one-year policies. Since each year is $75, three years would be 3 * 75. Let me do that math: 3 * 75 is $225. So, the cost for three one-year policies is $225.

Next, the question asks for the cost of a single three-year policy. I'm assuming that a three-year policy might have a different rate or maybe a discount. But wait, the problem doesn't mention any discount for longer terms. It just says the rate is $2.50 per $1,000. So, perhaps the three-year policy is just three times the annual cost. Hmm, but that would make it the same as three one-year policies, which doesn't make sense because usually, longer policies might have a different structure. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The rate is per $1,000 per year, so for three years, it's the same as (30,000 * 2.50) / 1000, but wait, that would be the annual rate multiplied by three. So, 75 * 3 is $225 again. But that can't be right because the options don't have $225 as both answers, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the three-year policy is a single payment covering all three years. So, the total would be 30,000 * 2.50 * 3, but no, that would be way too high. Wait, no, the rate is per $1,000 per year. So, for one year, it's 30,000 / 1000 = 30 units, times $2.50, which is $75. For three years, it's 30 units * $2.50 * 3 years, which is 30 * 2.50 *3. Let me compute that: 30 * 2.50 is 75, times 3 is 225. So, both the three one-year policies and the single three-year policy cost $225. But that can't be right because the question then asks for the difference between the two, which would be zero. But looking at the options, there's no zero. So, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the three-year policy has a different calculation. Maybe it's 30,000 * 2.50 * 3, but that would be 30,000 * 7.50, which is $225,000, which is way too high. No, that can't be right. So, perhaps the three-year policy is the same as three one-year policies, making the cost $225 each, so the difference is zero. But that's not an option. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the question is that for the three-year policy, the rate is $2.50 per $1,000 per year, so it's the same as three one-year policies. So, both would cost $225, meaning the difference is zero. But the options don't include zero. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, let me double-check. The question says, "What would the cost be for three consecutive one-year policies? What would the cost be for a 3-year policy? What is the difference between the two?" So, maybe the three-year policy is priced differently. Perhaps it's a lump sum with a discount. For example, maybe the three-year policy is 3 * 75 minus a discount. But the question doesn't mention any discounts, so I can't assume that. Alternatively, perhaps the three-year policy is the same as the annual cost multiplied by three, which would be $225, same as three one-year policies. So, the difference would be zero. But since that's not an option, maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the annual cost. Let me go back. The building is insured for $30,000 at $2.50 per $1,000. So, 30,000 divided by 1,000 is 30. 30 multiplied by 2.50 is 75. So, that's correct. So, three one-year policies would be 3 * 75 = 225. The three-year policy would be 30,000 * 2.50 * 3, but that's 30,000 * 7.50, which is 225,000. No, that can't be right because that's way too high. I think I'm confusing the rate. The rate is $2.50 per $1,000 per year. So, for three years, it's the same as 30,000 * 2.50 * 3 / 1000. Wait, no, that would be 30,000 / 1000 is 30, 30 * 2.50 is 75 per year, times 3 is 225. So, same as three one-year policies. So, the cost for both is $225, difference is zero. But since that's not an option, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, maybe the three-year policy is a single payment, but the rate is per year. So, the cost would be 30,000 * 2.50 * 3 / 1000 = 75 * 3 = 225. So, same as before. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the difference between the two. So, if both are $225, the difference is zero, but that's not an option. So, maybe I'm miscalculating. Alternatively, perhaps the three-year policy is priced at a lower rate. But the problem doesn't mention that, so I can't assume it. Therefore, perhaps the answer is that the difference is zero, but since that's not an option, maybe I need to re-examine.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the three-year policy is a single premium, but the one-year policies are annual. So, maybe the three-year policy has a slightly different calculation. Alternatively, maybe the three-year policy is simply 30,000 * 2.50 * 3, but that would be 30,000 *7.50, which is $225,000, which is way too high. No, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the rate is $2.50 per $1,000 per year, so for three years, it's 30,000 *2.50 *3 /1000. Let me compute that: 30,000 /1000 is 30, times 2.50 is 75, times 3 years is 225. So, same as three one-year policies. Therefore, the difference is zero. But since the options don't have zero, perhaps the question is structured differently.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again. The building is insured for $30,000 at the rate of $2.50 per $1,000. So, the premium is 30 * 2.50 = 75 per year. So, three one-year policies would be 3 *75=225. The three-year policy would be 75 *3=225. So, the difference is 225-225=0. But that's not an option. So, perhaps the question is wrong, or I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the three-year policy is only for three years, so the total would be 75*3=225. So, the cost for three one-year policies is 225, the cost for a three-year policy is 225, and the difference is zero. But since zero isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again. The question is about a 3-year policy. So, perhaps the three-year policy is a single payment of 30,000 *2.50 *3, but that would be 30,000 *7.50=225,000, which is way too high, so that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the three-year policy is 30,000 *2.50 =75, same as one year, but that doesn't make sense because it's for three years.

Wait, maybe the three-year policy is the same as three one-year policies, so the cost is the same, and the difference is zero. But since that's not an option, perhaps the problem is structured differently. Maybe the three-year policy is calculated as 30,000 *2.50 *3, but that's 225,000, which is way too high. No, that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the three-year policy is 30,000 *2.50 per year, so 30,000 *2.50 *3=225,000, but that's way too high, so I think that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the rate is per $1,000 per year, so for three years, it's 30,000 /1000=30, times 2.50=75 per year, times 3=225. So, same as before. Therefore, the difference is zero. But since that's not an option, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, maybe the question is about the cost for three consecutive one-year policies versus a single three-year policy, and the difference is zero, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is that the difference is zero, but that's not listed. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. The options are A to J, with J being $75. So, perhaps the correct answers are $225 for both, but the difference is zero, which isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps the three-year policy is priced differently.

Wait, maybe the three-year policy offers a 10% discount. Let me see. If three one-year policies are $225, and the three-year policy is $225 minus 10%, that's $202.50. Then the difference would be $22.50. Looking at the options, G is $22.50. So, perhaps that's the intended answer. But the problem didn't mention any discount, so I shouldn't assume that.

Alternatively, perhaps the three-year policy is a single payment, but the rate is the same as the annual rate, so 75 per year, so 75*3=225. So, same as three one-year policies. So, difference is zero.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the difference between the two, but maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me think again. The cost for three one-year policies is 75*3=225. The cost for a three-year policy is 75*3=225. So, the difference is 0. But since that's not an option, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the three-year policy is only for three years, but the rate is applied differently. Maybe the rate is per $1,000 for the entire period. So, for three years, the coverage is still $30,000, but the rate is per year, so 2.50 per $1,000 per year. So, 30,000 *2.50 *3 years = 30,000 *7.50=225,000, which is way too high. No, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the rate is $2.50 per $1,000 per year, so for three years, it's 2.50 *3=7.50 per $1,000. So, 30,000 /1000=30 units, times 7.50=225. So, same as before. So, the cost is $225 for both, difference is zero.

But since the options don't have zero, perhaps the intended answer is that the difference is zero, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the annual cost.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the annual cost. 30,000 divided by 1,000 is 30. 30 times 2.50 is 75. So, that's correct. So, three one-year policies are 3*75=225. The three-year policy is 30,000 *2.50 *3 /1000=225. So, same cost.

Therefore, the difference is zero. But since that's not an option, perhaps the question is asking for the difference in another way. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the three-year policy is for the entire three years, so the cost is 30,000 *2.50 *3=225,000. But that's way too high, so that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the three-year policy is 30,000 *2.50 per year, so 30,000 *2.50=75,000 per year, times 3 years=225,000. Again, that's way too high.

Wait, perhaps the rate is $2.50 per $1,000 per year. So, for three years, it's 30,000 *2.50 *3 /1000=225. So, same as before.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look at the options again. The options are:

A: $100

B: $67.50

C: $202.50

D: $225

E: $90

F: $250

G: $22.50

H: $150

I: $270

J: $75

So, from the calculations, three one-year policies are $225, which is option D. The three-year policy is also $225, so the difference is zero. But since zero isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is that the difference is zero, but that's not listed. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the difference as zero, but the options don't have it. Maybe the intended answer is that the cost for three one-year policies is $225 (D), the cost for a three-year policy is $225 (D), and the difference is zero, but since that's not an option, perhaps the question is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me try another approach. Maybe the three-year policy is priced at a single premium, but the rate is per year. So, the cost would be 30,000 *2.50 *3 /1000=225. So, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the three-year policy is a single payment, but the rate is applied annually. So, the total is 75*3=225. So, same as three one-year policies.

Therefore, the difference is zero. But since the options don't include zero, perhaps the intended answer is that the difference is zero, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the difference between the two policies in terms of cost, but both are $225, so difference is zero.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the three-year policy might have a different rate. But the problem doesn't mention that, so I can't assume it. Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that the cost for both policies is $225, so the difference is zero. But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is that the difference is zero, but that's not listed. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is that the difference is zero, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is that the cost for three one-year policies is $225 (D), the cost for a three-year policy is $225 (D), and the difference is zero, but since that's not an option, perhaps the problem is designed to have the difference as zero, but that's not listed.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try again. The annual cost is 30,000 *2.50 /1000 =75. So, three one-year policies are 75*3=225. The three-year policy would be 30,000 *2.50 *3 /1000=225. So, same as before.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the information given, both policies cost $225, so the difference is zero. But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is that the difference is zero, but that's not listed. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to have the three-year policy at a lower rate, but that's not stated.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the cost for three one-year policies versus a single three-year policy, but the three-year policy is priced at a higher rate. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the three-year policy is priced at a lower rate, but again, the problem doesn't mention that.

Given that, I think the correct answers are:

Three one-year policies: $225 (D)

Three-year policy: $225 (D)

Difference: $0

But since $0 isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is that the difference is zero, but that's not listed. Alternatively, perhaps the question has a typo, and the three-year policy is priced differently.

Wait, perhaps the three-year policy is for three years, but the rate is per $1,000 per policy, not per year. So, perhaps the rate is $2.50 per $1,000 for the entire three years. So, 30,000 /1000=30 units, times 2.50=75. So, the three-year policy would cost $75, and the three one-year policies would be 3*75=225. So, the difference would be 225-75=150. So, the cost for three one-year policies is $225, the three-year policy is $75, and the difference is $150.

Looking at the options, $150 is option H. So, perhaps that's the intended answer. But wait, the problem says the rate is $2.50 per $1,000, which I think is per year. So, if the rate is per year, then the three-year policy would be 75*3=225. But if the rate is per $1,000 for the entire three years, then it's 75 for three years. But the problem says "at the rate of $2.50 per $1,000", which I think implies per year.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify whether the rate is per year or per policy. If it's per policy, then the three-year policy would cost 75, and the three one-year policies would be 225, making the difference 150, which is option H. But I think the rate is per year, so the three-year policy would cost 225. But since the options include H as 150, perhaps that's the intended answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the rate is per $1,000 per year, so the three-year policy would cost 75 per year, totaling 225. So, the difference is zero. But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is that the three-year policy is $75, and the difference is $150.

But I'm not sure. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the intended answer is that the three-year policy costs $75, and the difference is $150. So, the cost for three one-year policies is $225 (D), the three-year policy is $75 (J), and the difference is $150 (H). But I'm not certain.

Wait, the problem says "insured for $30,000 at the rate of $2.50 per $1,000". It doesn't specify per year, so maybe the rate is per $1,000 regardless of the term. So, for any term, it's $2.50 per $1,000. So, for a one-year policy, it's 30,000 /1000=30 *2.50=75. For a three-year policy, it's the same: 30,000 /1000=30 *2.50=75. So, the three-year policy would cost $75, and the three one-year policies would be 3*75=225. So, the difference is 225-75=150.

Looking back, the options include H: $150, which would be the difference. So, the cost for three one-year policies is $225 (D), the three-year policy is $75 (J), and the difference is $150 (H). Therefore, the answers would be D, J, H.

But the question asks for the cost for three consecutive one-year policies, the cost for a three-year policy, and the difference between the two. So, the three one-year policies cost $225, the three-year policy costs $75, and the difference is $150.

But I'm not entirely confident because the rate might be intended to be per year. However, given the options, this seems to be the path the question is taking.
</think>

The cost for three consecutive one-year policies is $225, the cost for a three-year policy is $75, and the difference between the two is $150.

Answer: H
