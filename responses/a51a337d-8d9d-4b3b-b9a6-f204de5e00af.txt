Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Jellinek's model of alcoholism. I'm a bit rusty on my psychology, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking what progression the life of an alcoholic usually follows according to Jellinek (1952). The options are A through J, each listing different phases.

From what I remember, Jellinek was a pioneer in the study of alcoholism and proposed a specific model about the progression of the disease. His model was more medical, viewing alcoholism as a chronic condition that progresses through distinct stages.

I think the key here is to remember the order of stages Jellinek outlined. I recall terms like pre-alcoholic phase, then the actual alcoholic phase, followed by some phases related to recovery or relapse. Alternatively, maybe it's about the stages of the disease process itself.

Wait, another thought: Jellinek's model might include phases like the pre-alcoholic, then the alcoholic phase, followed by a recovery phase, and possibly a relapse phase. Or maybe it's about the stages of the disease: early, middle, late. But I'm not sure which option matches.

Looking at the options:

Option B is Prealcoholic phase, alcoholic phase, recovery phase, relapse phase. That seems plausible because it starts with before the problem, then the active phase, then trying to recover, and the possibility of relapse.

Option G is Early stage, middle stage, late stage, recovery stage. That sounds more like a general progression but I'm not sure if it's Jellinek's specific model.

Option J is Prealcoholic phase, prodromal, crucial, chronic. That seems to fit a disease progression, but I'm not certain if Jellinek used these terms.

Option C is Initial, adaptive, dependent, deteriorative. That could make sense, but I'm not sure if that's Jellinek's exact model.

Wait, I think Jellinek talked about the pre-alcoholic phase where the person hasn't yet developed the disease, then the alcoholic phase where they start to show signs of dependence, followed by the recovery phase, and then relapse. So that would align with option B.

Alternatively, sometimes models include stages like early, middle, late. For example, in some models, early stage might involve increased tolerance, middle stage involves loss of control, and late stage involves complications and possible recovery. But that would be more like option G.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Jellinek's model is often described as having three stages: the pre-alcoholic phase, the alcoholic phase, and the recovery phase. Or was it four stages including relapse?

Wait, I think the full model might include more phases. Another thought: Jellinek's model includes the pre-alcoholic phase, the alcoholic phase, and then the recovery phase. But some sources might break it down further.

Looking up in my mind, I think Jellinek's model is sometimes summarized as having three stages: pre-alcoholic, alcoholic, and recovery. But some versions include relapse as a separate phase, making it four stages. So option B includes four phases: prealcoholic, alcoholic, recovery, relapse.

Alternatively, I've heard of the disease model having stages like onset, dependency, and abstinence, but that's more like option A.

Wait, the question is about the life of an alcoholic. So perhaps it's about the natural progression before, during, and after. So pre-alcoholic, then alcoholic, then recovery, and then relapse could be part of the cycle.

Alternatively, the model might not include relapse as a separate phase but just recovery. But the options are different.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me recall: Jellinek's model starts with the pre-alcoholic phase, where the person is at risk but not yet an alcoholic. Then the alcoholic phase, where they become dependent. Then the recovery phase, and sometimes relapse is considered part of the cycle.

So option B is Prealcoholic, alcoholic, recovery, relapse. That seems to fit.

Another point: some sources say Jellinek's model includes the pre-alcoholic, the alcoholic, and the recovery phases, but not necessarily relapse as a separate phase. So perhaps option B is the correct one, but I'm not 100% certain.

Wait, another angle: looking at the options, option J is Prealcoholic, prodromal, crucial, chronic. Prodromal and crucial phases aren't terms I associate with Jellinek's model. I think he used pre-alcoholic and alcoholic phases.

So I'm leaning towards option B as the correct answer.

The question asks about the progression of an alcoholic's life according to Jellinek's model from 1952. Jellinek's model is a classic framework in the study of alcoholism, often viewed as a medical disease that progresses through distinct stages. The analysis considers the different phases described in Jellinek's model, including the pre-alcoholic phase, the alcoholic phase, recovery, and relapse. Option B aligns with this model, as it includes the pre-alcoholic phase, the alcoholic phase, recovery, and relapse phases, which fit Jellinek's description of the progression. Other options either misrepresent the model or use terms not associated with Jellinek's work. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B

The life of an alcoholic, according to Jellinek (1952), typically follows the progression: Prealcoholic phase, alcoholic phase, recovery phase, and relapse phase.

Answer: B
