Okay, so I've got this Python question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's asking. The question is about accessing an element in a list in Python 3. The list given is ['a', 'Chemistry', 0, 1], and we're supposed to find the value at index 1. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that in Python, lists are accessed using square brackets with indices starting at 0. So the first element is index 0, the second is 1, and so on. Let me break down the list:

- The first element is 'a' at index 0.
- The second element is 'Chemistry' at index 1.
- The third is 0 at index 2.
- The fourth is 1 at index 3.

So when the question is asking for [1], that should refer to the element at position 1, which is 'Chemistry'. Now I need to look at the options to see which one matches.

Looking at the options:

A: ['a', 0, 1] – That's a list, but it's not the element itself. It looks like it's taking elements 0, 1, 2, but that's not what the question is asking.

B: ['a', 'Chemistry', 1] – Again, a list, but this seems to be combining elements 0,1,3. Not sure why, but not the right answer.

C: 1 – That's the value at index 3, not 1.

D: Chemistry – That's exactly what we're looking for. The string 'Chemistry' at index 1.

E: ['a', 'Chemistry', 0, 1] – That's the entire list, so [1] would be 'Chemistry', but the option E is the whole list, so that's not it.

F: ['Chemistry', 0, 1] – This seems like a sublist starting from index 1, but again, the question is about a single element, not a sublist.

G: 'Chemistry', 0, 1 – This is written in a weird way, looks like a tuple or just separate values, but the correct way to represent a single element is just 'Chemistry'.

H: ['a', 'Chemistry'] – That's a list of the first two elements, but again, the question is about a single element.

I: 0 – That's index 2, so not the right answer.

J: a – Wait, 'a' is at index 0, but the question is asking for index 1, so this is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be D: Chemistry. I think that's it because the index 1 refers to the second element, which is 'Chemistry'.

The correct answer is D: Chemistry because it is the element at index 1 in the list.

Answer: D
