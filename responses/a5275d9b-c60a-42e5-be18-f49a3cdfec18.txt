Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem about the fraction of the standard solar flux reaching a solar collector in Regina, Saskatchewan at noon on the summer solstice. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the standard solar flux at Earth's surface is given as about 1000 W/m². But wait, that's the solar constant, right? I think that's the average flux outside the atmosphere, which is around 1361 W/m², but maybe the question is considering the actual flux reaching the ground, which is less due to the atmosphere. Oh wait, the question says "about 1000 W/m²", so I can use that as the given value.

Now, the collector is lying flat on the Earth’s surface. That probably means it's parallel to the ground. So the angle of incidence of the sunlight would depend on the latitude and the time of year.

The location is Regina, Saskatchewan, which is at latitude 50°N. We're looking at noon on the summer solstice. Summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere is June 21 or 22, so the days are longest there.

At noon on the summer solstice, the sun is at its highest point in the sky for that location. I think the solar elevation angle (the angle between the sun's rays and the horizontal) is maximum on that day. To find that angle, I might need to use some formula related to the sun's position.

I recall the formula for solar elevation angle (θ) at solar noon is given by:

sinθ = sin(φ) * sin(δ) + cos(φ) * cos(δ) * cos(0)

Where φ is the latitude, and δ is the solar declination angle. Since it's the summer solstice, the declination δ is +23.5°, because that's the maximum angle the sun reaches north of the equator during summer.

So plugging in the numbers:
φ = 50°N
δ = +23.5°

So sinθ = sin(50) * sin(23.5) + cos(50) * cos(23.5) * cos(0)

Wait, cos(0) is 1, so that simplifies things.

Let me calculate each part:

First, compute sin(50°) and sin(23.5°):
sin(50) ≈ 0.7660
sin(23.5) ≈ 0.3997

Multiplying them: 0.7660 * 0.3997 ≈ 0.3059

Next, cos(50°) ≈ 0.6428
cos(23.5°) ≈ 0.9171

Multiplying these: 0.6428 * 0.9171 ≈ 0.5903

Adding these two results: 0.3059 + 0.5903 = 0.8962

So sinθ ≈ 0.8962, which means θ ≈ arcsin(0.8962). Let me find that.

Arcsin of 0.8962 is around 63.5 degrees. Let me check with a calculator: yes, about 63.5 degrees.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the angle of incidence on the solar collector. The collector is lying flat, so the angle between the sun's rays and the normal to the collector is the same as the elevation angle. Wait no, if the collector is flat on the ground, its normal is vertical. So the angle of incidence would be 90° minus the elevation angle. Because when the sun is directly overhead, elevation is 90°, and angle of incidence is 0°.

Wait wait, no. Let me clarify. The solar elevation angle is measured from the horizon. If the collector is flat on the ground, its surface is horizontal, so the angle between the sun's rays and the collector's surface is the same as the elevation angle. Wait, no, if the collector is horizontal, the angle of incidence (the angle between the sun's rays and the normal to the collector) would be 90° minus the elevation angle. Because the normal is vertical, so when the sun is directly overhead (elevation 90°), the angle of incidence is 0°. When the sun is at the horizon (elevation 0°), the angle of incidence is 90°, which is maximum.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The angle of incidence is the angle between the sun's rays and the normal to the surface. For a horizontal surface, the normal is vertical. So if the sun is at the horizon (elevation 0°), the sun's rays are parallel to the ground, so the angle of incidence is 90°, meaning the sun is hitting the collector at a right angle. If the sun is directly overhead (elevation 90°), the angle of incidence is 0°, perfect incidence.

So, the elevation angle (θ) is measured from the horizon upwards. Therefore, the angle of incidence (i) is 90° - θ. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if θ is 0°, the sun is at the horizon, angle of incidence is 90°. If θ is 90°, angle of incidence is 0°. So angle of incidence i = 90° - θ.

Wait, that makes sense. So in our case, θ is 63.5°, so angle of incidence i = 90 - 63.5 = 26.5 degrees.

Now, the question is about the fraction of the incident flux that is received by the collector. When the sun is at an angle of incidence i, the actual flux received is reduced by a factor of cos(i), because the same amount of sunlight is spread over a larger area. So the effective flux is I = I0 * cos(i), where I0 is the incident flux (1000 W/m² here).

Wait, but wait another thing: the 1000 W/m² is the standard solar flux at Earth's surface, but when the sun is at an angle, the actual flux on a horizontal surface would be lower because of the same reason—cos(i). So the fraction is just cos(i).

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me make sure. The standard solar flux is the amount of solar radiation per unit area perpendicular to the sun's rays. So if the collector is flat, the angle between the sun's rays and the normal is i, so the effective flux is I = I0 * cos(i). Therefore, the fraction is cos(i).

In our case, i is 26.5°, so cos(26.5) is approximately what?

Calculating cos(26.5°): Let's see, cos(30°) is about 0.866, cos(25°) is around 0.906, so 26.5 is between 25 and 30, closer to 25. Let me get a more precise value.

Using a calculator function, cos(26.5°) ≈ 0.894.

Wait, but wait a second. Alternatively, maybe I should use the solar elevation angle in a different way. Because sometimes, when you have a flat surface, the angle between the sun's rays and the surface is equal to the elevation angle. Wait no, because the surface is horizontal, the angle between the sun's rays and the surface is 90° - i, where i is the angle of incidence. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait, let me approach this differently. The solar elevation angle θ is the angle above the horizon. The angle of incidence i is the angle between the sun's rays and the normal to the surface. Since the surface is horizontal, the normal is vertical. So when the sun is at elevation θ, the angle of incidence i is 90° - θ.

Wait, no, because when the sun is at the horizon (θ=0), the angle of incidence is 90°, and when the sun is directly overhead (θ=90°), the angle of incidence is 0°. So yes, i = 90° - θ.

So in our case, θ is 63.5°, so i = 26.5°, as before.

So the fraction is cos(i) = cos(26.5°) ≈ 0.894.

Wait, but another approach: sometimes the solar irradiance on a horizontal surface is given by I = I0 * cos(θ), where θ is the elevation angle. Wait, that can't be right because when θ is 90°, I would be I0 * 0, which is wrong. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting it mixed up.

Wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around. The solar irradiance on a horizontal surface is I = I0 * cos(i), where i is the angle of incidence. And since i = 90° - θ, that would mean I = I0 * cos(90° - θ) = I0 * sin(theta).

Wait, that makes more sense because when θ is 90°, sin(theta) is 1, so I=I0, which is correct. When θ=0°, sin(theta)=0, so I=0, which is correct because the sun is at the horizon and not contributing any direct light on a horizontal surface.

Wait, but that's conflicting with what I thought earlier. Let me clarify:

If the angle of incidence is i, then the effective flux is I = I0 * cos(i). And since i = 90° - θ, then I = I0 * cos(90° - θ) = I0 * sin(theta).

So in our case, theta is 63.5°, so sin(theta)=sin(63.5) ≈ 0.896, which matches what I got earlier. So the fraction is approximately 0.896.

Wait, but wait: the question is about the fraction of the standard solar flux reaching the Earth (1000 W/m²) that is available to the collector. So the collector's efficiency in terms of the angle is cos(i), but since the collector is flat, the flux it receives is I = 1000 * cos(i).

Wait, but earlier I thought that the fraction is cos(i), which would be 0.894, but using sin(theta) gives 0.896. These are very close, but which is correct?

Hmm, maybe I should double-check the formula. The solar irradiance (I) on a horizontal surface is given by I = I0 * sin(theta), where theta is the solar elevation angle. So in that case, the fraction is sin(theta), which is 0.896, so approximately 0.896.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the effective flux is I = I0 * cos(i), where i is the angle of incidence, and i =90° - theta. So cos(i) = cos(90 - theta) = sin(theta). So both approaches give the same result.

So in this case, the fraction would be sin(theta) where theta is 63.5°, which is approximately 0.896. Looking at the options, option B is 0.891, which is close but not exact. Hmm, perhaps my calculation of theta was a bit off.

Let me recalculate theta more accurately. The formula is:

sin(theta) = sin(phi) * sin(delta) + cos(phi) * cos(delta) * cos(omega)

Where omega is the hour angle. At solar noon, omega is 0°, so cos(omega) is 1.

So sin(theta) = sin(50) * sin(23.5) + cos(50) * cos(23.5)

Let me compute each part more precisely.

sin(50°) ≈ 0.7660444431
sin(23.5°) ≈ 0.399723385

Multiply them: 0.7660444431 * 0.399723385 ≈ 0.30588

cos(50°) ≈ 0.6427876097
cos(23.5°) ≈ 0.9171283568

Multiply them: 0.6427876097 * 0.9171283568 ≈ 0.59031

Add them together: 0.30588 + 0.59031 = 0.89619

So sin(theta) = 0.89619, so theta ≈ arcsin(0.89619) ≈ 63.50 degrees.

Now, sin(theta) is 0.89619, so the fraction is 0.896, which is approximately 0.896. Looking at the options, option B is 0.891, which is close but not exact. The next option is H: 0.85, which is lower. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the solar declination on the summer solstice is exactly 23.5°, but sometimes it's approximated as 23.27°, but for this problem, I think 23.5 is acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle of incidence is calculated differently. Let me think: if the collector is lying flat, then the angle between the sun's rays and the normal is i, and the effective flux is I = I0 * cos(i). Since i =90 - theta, then cos(i) = cos(90 - theta)=sin(theta). So the fraction is sin(theta)=0.89619, which is about 0.896, which would be closest to option B: 0.891. But the question gives option B as 0.891, which is slightly less than 0.896. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider atmospheric effects or other factors, but the question says "fraction of the standard solar flux," which is 1000 W/m², so maybe it's just a matter of precise calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute sin(theta) more accurately. Let me compute theta more precisely.

We have sin(theta)=0.89619, so theta=arcsin(0.89619). Let's compute that.

Using a calculator, arcsin(0.89619) is approximately 63.51 degrees.

Wait, but perhaps the solar elevation angle is a bit different. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the clear sky solar irradiance on a horizontal surface, which is given by:

I = I0 * sin(theta) * cos(i), but I'm getting confused again.

Wait, no, the correct formula for the solar irradiance on a horizontal surface is I = I0 * sin(theta), where I0 is the extraterrestrial flux (like 1361 W/m²), but in this problem, the standard flux is given as 1000 W/m², so perhaps I should use that as I0.

Wait, but in this problem, I think I0 is 1000 W/m², which is the standard solar flux at Earth's surface. So the effective flux on the collector would be I = 1000 * sin(theta), since the collector is flat, so the angle of incidence is i =90-theta, and cos(i)=sin(theta).

Therefore, the fraction is sin(theta)=0.89619, which is approximately 0.896.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.891, which is very close. The exact value would be 0.896, but perhaps due to rounding in the options, it's 0.891. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the solar declination on the summer solstice is 23.27 degrees, not 23.5, which is more precise. Let me check that.

The solar declination δ for the summer solstice is approximately 23.27°, not exactly 23.5°. Let me recalculate using δ=23.27.

So, φ=50°, δ=23.27°.

Compute sin(theta) = sin(50)*sin(23.27) + cos(50)*cos(23.27)

Calculate each part:

sin(50) ≈ 0.7660444431
sin(23.27) ≈ sin(23 + 0.27 degrees). 0.27 degrees is about 15.78 arcminutes. Using a calculator, sin(23.27) ≈ 0.39699.

Multiply: 0.7660444431 * 0.39699 ≈ 0.30419.

cos(50)≈0.6427876097
cos(23.27)≈cos(23.27)= approx 0.9171 (since cos(23.5)=0.9171, it's slightly higher for 23.27). Let me compute more accurately.

Using a calculator, cos(23.27°)≈0.9175.

Multiply: 0.6427876097 * 0.9175 ≈ 0.5908.

Add the two parts: 0.30419 + 0.5908 ≈ 0.89499.

So sin(theta)≈0.895, so theta≈arcsin(0.895)=approx 63.43 degrees.

Now, sin(theta)=0.895, which would make the fraction 0.895. Looking at the options, option B is 0.891, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the standard solar flux is 1000 W/m², but maybe it's measured at a different angle, so I need to adjust for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula involving the cosine of the latitude minus the solar declination, but that's more for estimating the maximum solar angle. Alternatively, perhaps I should use another approach.

Wait, another approach is to calculate the angle between the sun's rays and the normal to the collector. Since the collector is flat, the normal is vertical. So the angle of incidence i is equal to the zenith angle, which is 90-theta, where theta is the elevation angle.

But perhaps a simpler way is to use the formula for the solar altitude angle:

theta = 90 - (phi - delta)

Wait, no, that's not correct because that formula is a simplified version, but it's only accurate for certain conditions. The correct formula is the one I used earlier involving sine and cosine.

Alternatively, perhaps an approximate method: on the summer solstice, the sun at noon has its highest elevation, so perhaps the elevation angle can be approximated as theta = 90 - (phi - delta), but that's an approximation.

Wait, let's try that. phi=50°, delta=23.27°, so theta=90 - (50 -23.27)=90 -26.73=63.27°, which is close to our earlier calculation of 63.43°, so that's a good approximation.

So, sin(theta)=sin(63.27)=approx 0.894.

Hmm, so the fraction is about 0.894, which is approximately 0.894. The options given are A through J, with option B being 0.891 and option H being 0.85. So the closest option is B:0.891.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the problem expects the use of the solar altitude angle formula, which for solar noon on the summer solstice is given by:

theta = 90° - (phi - delta)

Which in this case would be theta=90 - (50 -23.27)=90-26.73=63.27°, as before.

So sin(theta)=sin(63.27)=approx 0.894.

Wait, but in the options, the closest is B:0.891, which is just slightly lower. Perhaps due to rounding or more precise calculation, the exact value might be 0.891.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the fact that the solar constant is 1361 W/m², but the question states that the standard solar flux is about 1000 W/m², so I should use 1000 as I0.

Another point to consider: sometimes, the solar irradiance on a horizontal surface is given by I = I0 * cos(omega) * sin(theta), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is I = I0 * sin(theta) * cos(omega), but at solar noon, omega is 0, so cos(omega)=1, so I=I0*sin(theta).

So, I think the correct fraction is approximately 0.894, which would correspond to option B:0.891, but perhaps the exact calculation gives 0.891.

Wait, perhaps my calculation of sin(theta) was a bit off. Let me compute sin(63.27°) precisely.

Using a calculator:

sin(63.27)= sin(63 + 0.27 degrees).

Convert 0.27 degrees to decimal: 0.27 * (π/180) ≈ 0.004705 radians.

Compute sin(63.27°): sin(63°) is about 0.8910. Then, using the approximation for small angles, sin(a + b) ≈ sin(a) + b*cos(a), where b is in radians.

So, a=63°, which is 1.1001 radians.

Wait, no, better to compute 63.27° as 63° 16.2 minutes. Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator function.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to accept that the fraction is approximately 0.894, which is very close to option B:0.891. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the angle of incidence is 26.73°, so cos(26.73)=approx 0.891. Let me check that.

cos(26.73°)=?

Well, cos(26°)=0.8988, cos(27°)=0.8910. So 26.73 is between 26 and 27. Let me interpolate.

The difference between 26 and 27 degrees is 1 degree, which corresponds to a decrease of about 0.8988 - 0.8910=0.0078 over 1 degree.

26.73 is 0.73 degrees above 26, so the decrease would be 0.73 * 0.0078 ≈ 0.0057.

So cos(26.73)=approx 0.8988 -0.0057=0.8931.

Wait, but that's about 0.893, which is close to 0.891, but not exactly.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the angle of incidence i is 26.73°, so cos(i)=0.893, which is about 0.893, which would correspond to option B:0.891. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option B.

Wait, but I think I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that the fraction is sin(theta)=approx 0.894, which is closest to option B:0.891.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the angle of incidence is i=90-theta, which is 26.73°, so cos(i)=0.891.

Wait, because cos(26.73)=approx 0.891, which matches option B.

Yes, that makes sense. Because if i=26.73°, then cos(i)=0.891, which is option B.

So the correct answer should be B:0.891.

To determine the fraction of the standard solar flux (1000 W/m²) reaching a solar collector lying flat on the ground in Regina, Saskatchewan (latitude 50°N) at noon on the summer solstice, we analyze the solar elevation angle and its impact on the flux received by the collector.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Solar Declination (δ):**  
   On the summer solstice, the solar declination is approximately **23.5°**.

2. **Solar Elevation Angle (θ):**  
   The solar elevation angle at noon is calculated using the formula:  
   \[
   \sin(\theta) = \sin(\phi) \cdot \sin(\delta) + \cos(\phi) \cdot \cos(\delta)
   \]  
   Substituting \( \phi = 50^\circ \) and \( \delta = 23.5^\circ \):  
   \[
   \sin(\theta) = \sin(50^\circ) \cdot \sin(23.5^\circ) + \cos(50^\circ) \cdot \cos(23.5^\circ)
   \]  
   Using approximations:  
   \[
   \sin(50^\circ) \approx 0.766, \quad \sin(23.5^\circ) \approx 0.3997, \quad \cos(50^\circ) \approx 0.6428, \quad \cos(23.5^\circ) \approx 0.9171
   \]  
   \[
   \sin(\theta) \approx (0.766 \cdot 0.3997) + (0.6428 \cdot 0.9171) \approx 0.3059 + 0.5903 = 0.8962
   \]  
   Thus, \( \theta \approx \arcsin(0.8962) \approx 63.5^\circ \).

3. **Angle of Incidence (i):**  
   Since the collector is flat, the angle of incidence \( i \) is the complement of the elevation angle:  
   \[
   i = 90^\circ - \theta \approx 90^\circ - 63.5^\circ = 26.5^\circ
   \]

4. **Fraction of Flux Received:**  
   The fraction of the standard solar flux received by the collector is given by \( \cos(i) \):  
   \[
   \cos(26.5^\circ) \approx 0.894
   \]  
   This value is closest to **option B: 0.891**.

### Conclusion:
The fraction of the standard solar flux reaching the solar collector is approximately **0.891**, corresponding to **option B**.

Answer: B
