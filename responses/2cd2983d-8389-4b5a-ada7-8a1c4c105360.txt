Question:

On Thursday morning, two plainclothes police officers were shot to death while trying to arrest a bank robber who had just robbed a bank. Following the killings, the police issued an "all-points-bulletin" for the arrest of a 40-year-old Caucasian male (height, 6 feet; weight, 150-155 pounds), who had been seen near the location of the bank robbery. On Friday, a security guard at a local department store was walking down Main Street when he noticed a tall, African American man who fit the bank robbery suspect's description in age, height, and weight. The security guard approached the person (and believing him to be the bank robbery suspect), pulled a gun and arrested him. The security guard held the man in custody until the police arrived a short time later. The police officer informed the security guard that he had arrested the wrong person. The man had told the security guard that he was not the man who had committed the bank robbery and shot the police officers. The man was humiliated by the false arrest. If the man asserts a claim for assault against the security guard, he will

Options:

A: not succeed, because the man did not suffer any injury from the security guard's act.
B: succeed, if the man can prove the security guard had no reason to suspect him
C: succeed, if the security guard's mistaken belief was unreasonable.
D: not succeed, because the security guard was performing his duty
E: succeed, if the man saw the security guard pointing the gun at him.
F: succeed, if the security guard used excessive force during the arrest
G: succeed, if the man experienced emotional trauma as a result of the false arrest
H: not succeed, because the security guard did not intend to injure the man.

Alright, so I've got this question about tort law, specifically dealing with assault claims. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: On Thursday, two police officers were killed while trying to arrest a bank robber. Then, the police issued an APB for this guyâ€”40-year-old Caucasian, 6 feet tall, 150-155 pounds. 

On Friday, a security guard saw a tall African American man who matched the age, height, and weight. So, the guard approached him, thinking he was the suspect, pulled a gun, arrested him, and held him until the police came. But then the police said it was the wrong guy. The man was humiliated and is now suing for assault.

The question is whether he can succeed in his claim against the security guard. The options are A through H.

Okay, so I need to recall what assault entails. Assault is typically defined as the intentional infliction of harmful or offensive contact upon another person. Alternatively, it can be the threat of imminent harmful contact that causes a reasonable fear of such contact.

In this case, the security guard pulled a gun and arrested the man. So, did this constitute assault? Well, pulling a gun and arresting someone could be seen as an offensive contact, but in some cases, if the person is acting under a reasonable belief, maybe it's not considered intentional tortious conduct.

Wait, the key here is whether the security guard's actions were reasonable. If the guard had a reasonable belief that the man was the suspect, then maybe he's protected by some sort of privilege or immunity. But if his belief was unreasonable, then he could be liable for assault.

Looking at the options:

A: Not succeed because no injury. But wait, assault doesn't always require physical injury. Even if there's no injury, the apprehension of harmful contact can be enough. So A might not be correct because the presence of a gun could cause the fear necessary for assault.

B: Succeed if guard had no reason to suspect. Hmm, that's about the reasonableness. If the guard had no reason, then that's part of the test. But I think the key is whether the belief was reasonable, not just if there was a reason or not.

C: Succeed if mistaken belief was unreasonable. That sounds closer. Because if the guard's belief was unreasonable, then he can't claim the defense of mistake. So the man could win if the guard's mistake was unreasonable.

D: Not succeed because guard was performing duty. But wait, the guard is a security guard, not a police officer. So maybe the duty doesn't provide the same immunity. Plus, even if performing a duty, if the actions were unreasonable, there could be liability.

E: Succeed if man saw the gun. That's about the apprehension. But seeing the gun would support the assault claim, but the option is about whether he saw it, not the reasonableness of the guard's actions.

F: Succeed if excessive force used. Excessive force could be a separate issue, but the question is about assault. So even if force was excessive, unless it's tied to the reasonableness of the belief, it might not directly answer the assault claim.

G: Succeed if emotional trauma. Emotional distress can be part of damages, but the main issue is whether the guard's action was an assault, i.e., intentional or under an unreasonable belief.

H: Not succeed because no intent to injure. But in cases of assault, it's about intent to cause apprehension, not necessarily to injure. The guard might have intended to arrest, but if the way he did it caused apprehension, that could be assault.

So, putting it together. The man is claiming assault. The guard's actions involved pulling a gun and arresting him. For assault, the key is whether the guard's actions were intentional and caused a reasonable apprehension of harmful contact.

The guard had a mistaken belief that the man was the suspect. But if that belief was unreasonable, then the guard can't claim a mistake as a defense, making him liable for assault.

Looking at the options, C says "succeed if the security guard's mistaken belief was unreasonable." That seems to fit because if the belief was unreasonable, then the guard's actions weren't justifiable, and the man can claim assault.

So the answer should be C.
</think>

The man can assert an assault claim against the security guard if he can prove that the guard's mistaken belief was unreasonable. This is because assault involves the intentional infliction of harmful or offensive contact, or the threat of imminent contact causing reasonable apprehension. If the guard's belief was unreasonable, it undermines any defense of mistake, making the guard liable for assault. 

Answer: C
