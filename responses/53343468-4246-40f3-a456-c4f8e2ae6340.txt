Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which defense mechanism this 14-year-old girl is using. Let me read through the question again and break it down.

The girl is 14 and was brought to the physician because her mom found out she started having sex with various partners a month ago. She doesn't use protection, and her mom is worried. The parents separated three months ago. Before the separation, she was an honor student, into sports and leadership. But since the separation, she's become sullen, defiant, rebellious. She's started smoking, breaking curfews, skipping school.

So, the question is about the defense mechanism she's using. The options are A to J, each a different mechanism.

First, I need to recall what each defense mechanism means. Let's go through them quickly.

A: Acting out. That's when someone's expressing their feelings or conflicts through actions rather than words. It's like when you can't cope with emotions, so you act in ways that might be harmful or disruptive.

B: Intellectualization. This is when you deal with emotional conflicts by focusing on logic or facts, often to avoid the feelings. So, you detach emotionally and think abstractly.

C: Projection. This is when you attribute your own feelings or thoughts onto someone else. Like, if you're angry at your boss, you come home and take it out on your partner.

D: Regression. Going back to an earlier stage of development, like a child. Maybe acting more immature, such as throwing tantrums or being overly dependent.

E: Displacement. Redirecting feelings from a higher authority to someone or something less threatening. For example, a kid who's mad at their parent might take it out on a sibling.

F: Rationalization. Creating a logical excuse for something you do, often to justify unacceptable feelings or behaviors. Like when someone cheats and says they did it because the other person was unfaithful.

G: Denial. Refusing to accept reality or facts. Like saying "It's not happening" even when it is.

H: Repression. Keeping emotions or memories out of conscious awareness. It's like burying your feelings so you don't deal with them.

I: Sublimation. Channeling unacceptable impulses into socially acceptable activities. Like turning anger into sports or art.

J: Reaction formation. Doing the opposite of what you really feel. For example, showing excessive love to someone you actually hate.

Now, looking at the girl's behavior. She's been acting out in various ways since her parents separated. She's having sex, smoking, skipping school, being truant, and defying her curfew. These are all outward acts of rebellion.

She was previously a model student but now is acting out in ways that are rebellious and risky. Her behavior seems to be a reaction to her parents' separation, which is a significant life change and likely caused her a lot of emotional turmoil.

Acting out (Option A) fits because she's expressing her inner conflicts and emotions through her actions rather than dealing with them directly. She might be feeling a mix of anger, sadness, or confusion about her parents' separation, and instead of talking about it or addressing it, she's acting in ways that are rebellious.

Other options don't fit as well. Intellectualization (B) doesn't make sense because she's not detaching with logic; she's acting. Projection (C) might be part of it, but it's more about her own feelings. Displacement (E) could be, but it's more about redirecting anger. Rationalization (F) is about justifying her actions, but the question is about the mechanism she's using to cope, not justifying.

Denial (G) would be if she didn't accept the situation, but she's aware enough to have started these behaviors. Repression (H) is hiding feelings, but her actions suggest she's expressing them outwardly.

Sublimation (I) would involve redirecting negative feelings into positive activities, but she's doing the opposite. Reaction formation (J) is about doing the opposite of what she feels, which isn't exactly what's happening here.

So, the most fitting is A: Acting out. She's using her behavior to express her inner turmoil and rebellion, which aligns with acting out as a defense mechanism.

The girl is likely using the defense mechanism of **acting out** (Option A). This is evident as she is expressing her inner turmoil and rebellion through outward actions such as promiscuity, smoking, skipping school, and defying curfews, rather than addressing her emotions directly. Her behavior fits the pattern of acting out, where she uses actions to cope with her feelings of anger, sadness, or confusion stemming from her parents' separation.

Answer: A
