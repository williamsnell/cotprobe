Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the percent decrease in intensity of gamma radiation after passing through a certain depth of bismuth. Hmm, I remember that gamma radiation intensity decreases exponentially with thickness, right? The formula for the intensity after passing through a material is I = I0 * e^(-μx), where μ is the attenuation coefficient and x is the thickness.

Wait, but the problem gives something called a "mass absorption coefficient" with a half thickness of 12 g/cm². Oh right, the half thickness is the thickness of material that reduces the intensity by half. So, the half thickness, H, is related to the attenuation coefficient μ. 

I think the relationship is H = ln(2) / μ. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Oh yes, the half thickness H is the thickness where the intensity decreases by half, so I = I0 / 2 when x = H. Plugging into the exponential formula: 1/2 = e^(-μH). Taking the natural log of both sides gives ln(1/2) = -μH → μH = ln(2). So, μ = ln(2)/H. 

So, the attenuation coefficient μ is ln(2) divided by the half thickness H. Given H is 12 g/cm², so μ = 0.6931 / 12 ≈ 0.05776 cm²/g. 

Wait, but the density is given in kg/m³. I need to make sure the units match. Let me convert the density to g/cm³ because the half thickness is in g/cm². 

Density of bismuth is 9.80 × 10^3 kg/m³. Since 1 kg = 1000 g and 1 m³ = 10^6 L = 10^6 * 1000 cm³? Wait, no, 1 m³ is (100 cm)^3 = 1e6 cm³, and 1 kg is 1000 g. So, 9.80e3 kg/m³ = 9.80e3 * 1000 g / 1e6 cm³ = 9.80e3 * 1e3 g / 1e6 cm³ = (9.80e6 g) / 1e6 cm³ = 9.8 g/cm³. 

So, density ρ = 9.8 g/cm³. 

Now, the material's mass thickness is given by H = 12 g/cm². But I think I need to find the actual thickness in cm that corresponds to 1.5 cm depth. Wait, no, the depth is 1.5 cm, but the material's mass thickness would be ρ * x. Because mass thickness is density multiplied by physical depth. 

So, the mass thickness at 1.5 cm depth is ρ * x = 9.8 g/cm³ * 1.5 cm = 14.7 g/cm². 

Wait, but H is 12 g/cm², which is the half thickness. So, the number of half thicknesses that the gamma radiation passes through is the mass thickness divided by H. So, n = (14.7 g/cm²) / (12 g/cm²) ≈ 1.225. 

Each half thickness reduces the intensity by half. So, after n half thicknesses, the intensity is (1/2)^n of the original. So, the remaining intensity is I = I0 * (1/2)^1.225. 

Let me calculate (1/2)^1.225. Taking natural logs, ln(1/2^1.225) = -1.225 * ln(2) ≈ -1.225 * 0.6931 ≈ -0.848. So, I ≈ e^(-0.848) ≈ 0.428. So, the remaining intensity is about 42.8% of I0. 

The percent decrease is 100% - 42.8% ≈ 57.2%. Looking at the options, option G is 57.15%, which matches closely. So, the answer should be G.

To determine the percent decrease in intensity of gamma radiation after passing through a depth of 1.5 cm in bismuth, we use the exponential attenuation formula:

\[
I = I_0 \cdot e^{-\mu x}
\]

where \( \mu \) is the attenuation coefficient and \( x \) is the thickness. The problem provides a half thickness \( H = 12 \, \text{g/cm}^2 \), which relates to \( \mu \) as:

\[
\mu = \frac{\ln(2)}{H} = \frac{0.6931}{12} \approx 0.05776 \, \text{cm}^2/\text{g}.
\]

The density of bismuth is \( 9.80 \times 10^3 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \), which converts to \( 9.8 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \). The mass thickness at a depth of \( 1.5 \, \text{cm} \) is:

\[
\text{Mass thickness} = \rho \cdot x = 9.8 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \cdot 1.5 \, \text{cm} = 14.7 \, \text{g/cm}^2.
\]

The number of half thicknesses (\( n \)) is:

\[
n = \frac{\text{Mass thickness}}{H} = \frac{14.7}{12} \approx 1.225.
\]

The remaining intensity after passing through this depth is:

\[
I = I_0 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{1.225}.
\]

Calculating \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{1.225} \):

\[
\ln\left(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{1.225}\right) = -1.225 \cdot \ln(2) \approx -0.848,
\]
\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{1.225} \approx e^{-0.848} \approx 0.428.
\]

The remaining intensity is approximately \( 42.8\% \) of the original, so the percent decrease is:

\[
100\% - 42.8\% \approx 57.2\%.
\]

The closest option is **G: 57.15%**.
