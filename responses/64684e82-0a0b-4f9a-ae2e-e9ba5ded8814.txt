Okay, so I'm trying to solve this thermodynamics problem about the vibrational contribution to the heat capacity of iodine gas. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with heat capacities, especially for gases, it's important to consider different degrees of freedom—translational, rotational, and vibrational. 

The question states that the molar constant volume heat capacity (Cv) for I2(g) is 28.6 J/mol·K. I need to find the vibrational contribution. Oh, right, and electronic contributions are negligible, so I don't have to worry about those.

I think the total heat capacity at constant volume, Cv, for a diatomic gas like I2 can be broken down into contributions from translational, rotational, and vibrational motions. For a diatomic molecule, the translational contribution is (3/2)R, and the rotational contribution is (1/2)R because each rotational degree contributes (1/2)R. Wait, no, wait—actually, for a diatomic, there are two rotational degrees of freedom, so the rotational contribution is R. Or is it (1/2)R? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, for a diatomic gas, the translational degrees of freedom contribute (3/2)R. The rotational degrees, since it's a diatomic, have two rotational axes (they can rotate around two axes perpendicular to the bond), each contributing (1/2)R, so together (2*(1/2)R) = R. But wait, wait—no, actually, I think for rotation in a diatomic molecule, the moment of inertia is such that only two rotational modes are present, each with (1/2)R. So rotational contribution is R. Then the vibrational modes contribute the rest.

But wait, wait a second. At room temperature, the vibrational modes don't contribute much because their energies are quantized and require higher temperatures to excite. So maybe the question is assuming that at the given temperature, only translational and rotational contributions are significant, and the vibrational is what's left.

But wait, wait, the problem says to find the vibrational contribution. So the given Cv is the total, and we subtract the contributions from translation and rotation to get the vibrational part.

So, let me calculate the translational and rotational contributions.

The gas constant R is 8.314 J/mol·K. So translational Cv is (3/2)R = (3/2)*8.314 ≈ 12.47 J/mol·K.

Wait, but wait that's for an ideal monatomic gas. For diatomic, the translational part is the same, right? Because translation doesn't depend on the structure, just the mass. So I2 is diatomic, but translational Cv is still (3/2)R.

Rotational Cv for diatomic is R. Because each rotational mode contributes (1/2)R, and there are two modes, so 2*(1/2)R = R. So rotational Cv is R ≈8.314 J/mol·K.

Then the sum of translational and rotational Cv is (3/2 R) + R = (5/2 R) ≈ (5/2)*8.314 ≈ 20.785 J/mol·K.

Wait, but wait, the total Cv given is 28.6 J/mol·K. If the sum of translational and rotational is about 20.785, then the vibrational contribution would be 28.6 - 20.785 ≈ 7.815 J/mol·K. Looking at the options, option H is 7.82 J/(mol·K), which seems close to that.

But wait, wait—am I missing something? Because sometimes for diatomic gases at room temperature, the vibrational contribution might not be fully excited and could be approximated using the Einstein model or the Debye model. But wait, the problem doesn't specify the temperature, so I think the approach is to just subtract the translational and rotational contributions from the total.

Wait, another thought: for diatomic molecules, sometimes the rotational contribution isn't fully active at lower temps. But the problem says to assume electronic contributions are negligible, but doesn't say anything about rotational. But the problem seems to present the total Cv and asks for the vibrational part, so probably assuming that the given Cv includes all modes except electronic, which is negligible.

So total Cv = translational + rotational + vibrational. So vibrational Cv = total - translational - rotational.

So, calculate:

Translational: (3/2) R ≈ (3/2)*8.314 ≈ 12.471 J/mol·K
Rotational: R ≈8.314 J/mol·K
Sum: 12.471 +8.314 ≈20.785 J/mol·K
Total given: 28.6 J/mol·K
Vibrational: 28.6 -20.785 ≈7.815 J/mol·K

Looking at the options, H is 7.82, which matches closely. So the answer should be H.

The molar constant volume heat capacity ($C_v$) for $\mathrm{I}_2(\mathrm{g})$ is given as $28.6 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}$. To find the vibrational contribution, we subtract the contributions from translational and rotational degrees of freedom. 

For a diatomic molecule:
- Translational contribution: $\frac{3}{2}R = \frac{3}{2} \times 8.314 \approx 12.47 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}$.
- Rotational contribution: $R = 8.314 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}$.

The sum of translational and rotational contributions is:
\[
12.47 + 8.314 \approx 20.785 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}.
\]

The vibrational contribution is then:
\[
28.6 - 20.785 \approx 7.815 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}.
\]

The closest option is **H: 7.82 $\mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}$**.

Answer: H
