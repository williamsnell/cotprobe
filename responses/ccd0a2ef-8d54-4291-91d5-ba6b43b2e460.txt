Okay, I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the Minoans. The question is asking what they did during periods of great difficulty and stress to appease the gods. The options are from A to J. 

First, I need to recall what I know about the Minoans. They were an ancient civilization on Crete, known for their advanced culture, art, and architecture. They were also famous for their palaces, like the one at Knossos. I remember that in many ancient cultures, people would perform certain rituals or actions to please their gods, especially during tough times like droughts, wars, or other crises.

Looking at the options, let's go through each one:

A: Stopped all forms of art and music. I don't think the Minoans stopped their arts; in fact, they were quite known for their art. So probably not A.

B: Fasted for long periods. Fasting is a common religious practice, but I'm not sure if the Minoans specifically did this as a way to appease gods. Not my first thought.

C: Built monumental structures. They did build structures, but were these during times of stress? I think they built their palaces more as centers of power and culture, not necessarily as appeasements during hard times.

D: Sacrificed adults and occasionally children. I remember that in some Minoan practices, there were rituals involving sacrifices. I think the term "Minoan ritual" sometimes refers to child sacrifices, though I'm not entirely sure. But I'm not certain if this was their main way of appeasing the gods during stress.

E: Burnt their own houses to the ground. That seems extreme, but I don't recall hearing about the Minoans doing this as a religious practice. Maybe during war, but not as a regular ritual.

F: Abstained from sexual relations. Some cultures have periods of abstinence during religious times, but I'm not sure about the Minoans specifically doing this.

G: Enacted strict laws and punishments. More about governance than appeasing gods, I think.

H: Buried their possessions. This sounds like something from the Egyptian Book of the Dead or similar practices, not specifically Minoan.

I: Performed complex dance rituals. The Minoans were known for their dance, like the bull-leaping. Maybe they did dance rituals as part of their religious practices, but is this the act to appease gods during stress?

J: Migrated to different regions. They might have moved due to various reasons, but not specifically as a religious act to please gods.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. I think the Minoans had a pantheon of gods, and during tough times, they might have performed rituals. I recall that in Minoan art, there are depictions of what looks like sacrifices, perhaps of animals. But the question is about what they did to appease the gods during stress, like natural disasters or other crises.

Another thought: The Minoans were known for their religious practices, which included bull worship. The bull was a symbol of their religion. They might have performed rituals involving bulls, possibly including sacrifices. If the options include something about animal sacrifices, that would make sense. But looking at the options, D mentions sacrificing adults and children, which is more specific and perhaps more severe.

Wait, but I'm trying to remember if the Minoans actually practiced human sacrifice. I think some sources suggest that they did, particularly involving children, perhaps as offerings to their gods. This might have been done during times of stress to please the deities and seek their favor.

So, considering all this, the answer might be D: sacrificed adults and occasionally children.

Among the options provided, sacrificing adults and occasionally children aligns with historical accounts suggesting such rituals were performed to seek divine favor during stressful periods.
