Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about photoelectric work functions and threshold wavelengths. Hmm, I remember that the photoelectric effect has to do with electrons being emitted from a metal when light shines on it. The key thing is the work function, which is the minimum energy needed to eject an electron.

The question lists the work functions for several metals: Cs is 3.2e-19 J, Cu is 6.4e-19 J, K is 3.6e-19 J, and Zn is 5.8e-19 J. I need to find out which metals won't emit photoelectrons when illuminated with visible light.

Wait, visible light has a certain energy range. I think visible light is roughly from 400 nm to 700 nm, which corresponds to a frequency range. The energy of a photon is given by E = hf = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

So the threshold wavelength λ0 is the maximum wavelength that can cause emission. The formula I remember is λ0 = hc / Φ, where Φ is the work function. If the incoming light's wavelength is shorter than λ0, the energy is higher than the work function, and photoelectrons are emitted. But if the wavelength is longer (lower energy), then no emission.

Wait, no, actually, the threshold is the minimum wavelength needed. Because higher energy (shorter wavelength) photons are required. Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Let me think again. The threshold wavelength is the longest wavelength that can cause emission. Because if the wavelength is longer (lower energy), it's below the threshold, so no emission. So if the incoming light has a wavelength longer than the threshold, then it won't emit electrons.

Wait, no, no. The threshold wavelength is the maximum wavelength that can cause emission. Because E = hc/λ, so longer λ means lower energy. So if the incoming photon's wavelength is equal to or shorter than the threshold, the energy is sufficient. If it's longer than the threshold, the energy is too low.

So for visible light, which is about 400-700 nm, I need to calculate the threshold wavelengths for each metal and see which metals have a threshold wavelength shorter than 400 nm. Because if the threshold is below 400 nm, then visible light (which is 400 nm and longer) would have higher energy than the work function, so photoemission would occur. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify: The threshold wavelength is the maximum wavelength that can cause emission. So if the incoming light's wavelength is less than or equal to the threshold, then the energy is sufficient, and photoelectrons are emitted. If the incoming wavelength is longer than the threshold, then energy is insufficient, and no emission.

But visible light is from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). So for a metal to not emit photoelectrons under visible light, the threshold wavelength of that metal must be less than 400 nm. Because visible light's maximum wavelength is 700 nm, but the metal's threshold is, say, 300 nm. So any visible light (up to 700 nm) would be shorter than 300 nm? Wait no, 700 is longer than 300.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me think again.

The threshold wavelength (λ0) is the maximum wavelength (i.e., the longest wavelength) that can cause photoemission. So for a given metal, if the incoming light has a wavelength shorter than or equal to λ0, then it has enough energy to eject electrons. If the wavelength is longer than λ0, it doesn't.

So visible light has wavelengths from 400 nm (violet, high energy) to 700 nm (red, low energy). So for a metal to not emit electrons under visible light, all wavelengths in the visible spectrum must be longer than its threshold wavelength. Because then, the visible light's energy is too low.

Wait, no. If a metal's threshold is λ0, then any light with λ ≤ λ0 will cause emission. So for visible light (λ from 400 to 700 nm), if the metal's λ0 is greater than 700 nm, then even the longest visible wavelength (700 nm) is less than λ0. So the energy of 700 nm is hc/(700e-9 m), which is less than the work function (since hc/λ0 = Φ). So if visible light's maximum wavelength (700 nm) is longer than λ0, then the metal's threshold is lower than 700 nm. Wait, no, I'm getting myself mixed up.

Let me approach it step by step.

First, calculate the threshold wavelength λ0 for each metal using λ0 = hc / Φ.

Constants: h = 6.626e-34 J·s, c = 3e8 m/s.

Compute λ0 for each:

Cs: Φ = 3.2e-19 J
λ0 (Cs) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / 3.2e-19

Calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divide by 3.2e-19 J: 1.9878e-25 / 3.2e-19 = approx 6.211e-7 meters, which is 621 nm.

Wait, that's 621 nm, which is in the visible range (since visible is up to 700 nm). So Cs has λ0 at 621 nm. So visible light (which goes up to 700 nm) includes wavelengths longer than 621 nm (like 650, 700) which are longer than the threshold. So for Cs, since the threshold is 621 nm, any light with λ ≤ 621 nm would cause emission. But visible light has wavelengths up to 700 nm, which is longer than 621. So when visible light shines on Cs, will the electrons be emitted?

Wait, no. Because the threshold is λ0=621 nm. So any light with λ ≤ 621 nm (which is higher energy than 621 nm) can cause emission. But visible light includes wavelengths longer than 621 nm, like 650 nm, which is lower energy. So 650 nm is longer than 621 nm, so it's below the threshold. So the energy of 650 nm would be E = hc/(650e-9) ≈ (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / 650e-9 ≈ 3.07e-19 J. Cs's Φ is 3.2e-19 J. So 3.07e-19 < 3.2e-19, so not enough. So Cs would not emit electrons when illuminated with light longer than 621 nm, which includes part of the visible spectrum (like red light above 621 nm).

Wait, but wait! The threshold wavelength is the maximum wavelength that can cause emission. So if the incoming light is at 621 nm or shorter, it works. If longer, it doesn't. So visible light includes wavelengths longer than 621 nm (like 650, 700). So for Cs, the visible light that's longer than 621 nm (e.g., 650 nm) wouldn't cause emission, but shorter wavelengths (like 550 nm) would.

Wait, but the question is asking which metals will NOT emit photoelectrons when illuminated with visible light. That is, for which metals, visible light (all wavelengths from 400 to 700 nm) are insufficient to cause emission. So for those metals, even the shortest visible wavelength (400 nm) is longer than their threshold wavelength.

Wait no, no. The metals that don't emit electrons under any visible light would have their threshold wavelength longer than 700 nm. Because visible light only goes up to 700 nm. So if the metal's threshold is, say, 800 nm, then visible light (max 700) is not enough. So for such metals, no photoelectrons would be emitted.

Wait, wait, no. Because the threshold is the maximum wavelength that can cause emission. So if the threshold is λ0, then for any light with λ ≤ λ0, the energy is sufficient. If λ > λ0, not sufficient. So for a metal to not emit electrons under any visible light, all visible wavelengths must be longer than its threshold. That is, the metal's threshold must be less than 400 nm. Because visible light starts at 400 nm. So if the metal's threshold is, say, 350 nm, then visible light (400-700) is all longer than 350 nm, so not enough energy. So no photoemission.

So let me compute the threshold wavelengths again and see which are below 400 nm.

Compute for each metal:

Cs: Φ = 3.2e-19 J
λ0 = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / 3.2e-19 = (1.9878e-25) / 3.2e-19 = approx 6.211e-7 m = 621 nm.

Cu: Φ = 6.4e-19 J
λ0 = (6.626e-34 *3e8)/6.4e-19 = (1.9878e-25) / 6.4e-19 ≈ 3.106e-7 m = 310.6 nm.

K: Φ = 3.6e-19 J
λ0 = 1.9878e-25 / 3.6e-19 = approx 5.52e-7 m = 552 nm.

Zn: Φ =5.8e-19 J
λ0 = 1.9878e-25 /5.8e-19 ≈ 3.427e-7 m = 342.7 nm.

So the threshold wavelengths are:

Cs: ~621 nm
Cu: ~311 nm
K: ~552 nm
Zn: ~343 nm

Now, visible light is 400-700 nm.

So for each metal, check if any part of the visible spectrum is below their threshold (i.e., can cause emission) or not.

If the metal's threshold is <= 700 nm, then part of the visible spectrum (up to threshold) can cause emission. If the threshold is above 700 nm, then no, because visible light doesn't go beyond 700.

Wait no, no. The threshold is the max wavelength that can cause emission. So if the threshold is, say, 621 nm (Cs), then any light with λ <=621 nm (like 600 nm) can cause emission. But visible light includes wavelengths up to 700 nm, which is longer than 621. So for Cs, visible light that's longer than 621 nm (e.g., 650 nm) won't cause emission, but shorter wavelengths (like 500 nm) will.

But the question is about metals that will not emit photoelectrons when illuminated with visible light. So which metals have all visible wavelengths above their threshold? That is, their threshold is longer than the maximum visible wavelength (700 nm). Because then, visible light's highest wavelength is 700, which is below the threshold, so no emission.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let me list the metals with their thresholds:

Cs: 621 nm
Cu: 311 nm
K: 552 nm
Zn: 343 nm

So for each metal, does any wavelength in the visible spectrum (400-700 nm) have λ <= their threshold? If yes, then they can emit. If no, meaning all visible λ > their threshold, then they can't emit.

Wait, but the threshold is the maximum wavelength that causes emission. So if visible light has any wavelength <= threshold, then emission occurs. So for a metal to not emit, all visible wavelengths must be longer than the threshold. So their threshold must be less than 400 nm.

Because visible starts at 400 nm. So if the threshold is, say, 350 nm, then visible light is 400-700 nm, all longer than 350, so no emission.

So which metals have threshold <400 nm?

Looking at the thresholds:

- Cs: 621 >400 → can emit for λ <=621 (so visible light up to 621 would cause emission)
- Cu:311 <400 → so visible light starts at 400, which is longer than 311. So all visible light (400-700) is longer than Cu's threshold. So Cu would not emit.
Wait, no. Because Cu's threshold is 311 nm. So any light with λ <=311 would cause emission. But visible light starts at 400, which is longer than 311. So for Cu, visible light doesn't reach the threshold. So Cu won't emit.

Wait, no! Because the threshold is the maximum wavelength that can cause emission. So if the threshold is 311 nm, then any light with wavelength <=311 nm would cause emission. But visible light starts at 400 nm, which is longer than 311. So visible light is all above the threshold, so no emission.

Similarly, Zn's threshold is 343 nm. Visible light starts at 400, which is longer than 343, so Zn won't emit.

Wait, but wait. No, because Zn's threshold is 343, which is less than 400. So visible light (starting at 400) is all longer than Zn's threshold. So Zn won't emit.

Wait, but wait. Let me look at each metal:

- Cs: 621 nm. Visible light goes up to 700 nm. So the part of visible light below 621 nm (like 500) would cause emission. But the part above (650) wouldn't. So Cs would emit for some visible wavelengths, not all. So the question is, will it "not emit photoelectrons when illuminated with visible light"? So if even part of the visible spectrum causes emission, then the metal does emit. Only if none of the visible spectrum causes emission would it not emit.

Wait, the question is phrased as: "Which metals will not emit photoelectrons when illuminated with visible light?" So if any wavelength in the visible spectrum can cause emission, the metal does emit. So only metals where all visible wavelengths are below their threshold (i.e., their threshold is longer than 700 nm) would not emit.

Wait, no. Because threshold is the maximum wavelength that causes emission. So if a metal's threshold is λ0, then any wavelength ≤ λ0 causes emission.

So for a metal to not emit when illuminated with visible light, all wavelengths in the visible spectrum must be > λ0. That is, λ0 < 400 nm (since visible starts at 400). Because if λ0 is less than 400, then visible light's minimum wavelength (400) is still longer than λ0, meaning all visible light can't cause emission.

Wait, no. Let me think. If the metal's threshold is λ0, then any light with λ ≤ λ0 causes emission. So for the metal to not emit under any visible light, all visible light's wavelengths must be > λ0. So λ0 must be < 400 nm.

So looking at the metals:

- Cs: λ0=621 nm → visible light up to 700 nm includes wavelengths below 621, so emits.
- Cu: λ0=311 nm → visible light starts at 400, which is >311. So all visible light is longer than 311, so no emission.
- K: λ0=552 nm → visible light includes 400-552 nm, which are ≤552. So emits.
- Zn: λ0=343 nm → visible starts at 400>343. So all visible light is longer, so no emission.

So the metals that won't emit are Cu and Zn.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Options are:

A: K and Cu

B: Cs and Cu

C: All metals listed

D: Cs and K

E: W and Zn

F: W and Cs

G: None of the metals listed

H: Cu and Zn

I: K and Zn

J: W and K

Wait, but the options don't include Cu and Zn as an option. H is Cu and Zn. So the answer would be H.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Cu's threshold is 311 nm (so visible starts at 400, which is longer, so no emission).

Zn's threshold is 343 nm. Visible starts at 400, which is longer than 343. So no emission.

So both Cu and Zn won't emit under visible light.

Looking at the options, H is Cu and Zn.
</think>

To determine which metals will not emit photoelectrons when illuminated with visible light, we calculate the threshold wavelengths for each metal using the formula:

\[
\lambda_0 = \frac{hc}{\Phi}
\]

where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \Phi \) is the work function of the metal. The threshold wavelength \( \lambda_0 \) is the maximum wavelength that can cause photoemission. If the wavelength of the incident light is greater than \( \lambda_0 \), no photoelectrons will be emitted.

### Step 1: Calculate the threshold wavelengths
Using the given work functions:
- **Cs**: \( \Phi = 3.2 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)
  \[
  \lambda_0 = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{3.2 \times 10^{-19}} = 621 \, \text{nm}
  \]
- **Cu**: \( \Phi = 6.4 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)
  \[
  \lambda_0 = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{6.4 \times 10^{-19}} = 311 \, \text{nm}
  \]
- **K**: \( \Phi = 3.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)
  \[
  \lambda_0 = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{3.6 \times 10^{-19}} = 552 \, \text{nm}
  \]
- **Zn**: \( \Phi = 5.8 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)
  \[
  \lambda_0 = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{5.8 \times 10^{-19}} = 343 \, \text{nm}
  \]

### Step 2: Analyze the results
Visible light has wavelengths in the range \( 400 \, \text{nm} \) to \( 700 \, \text{nm} \). For a metal to not emit photoelectrons when illuminated with visible light, all wavelengths in the visible spectrum must be greater than the metal's threshold wavelength (\( \lambda_0 \)). This means the metal's threshold wavelength must be less than \( 400 \, \text{nm} \).

- **Cs**: \( \lambda_0 = 621 \, \text{nm} \) (visible light includes wavelengths shorter than \( 621 \, \text{nm} \), so photoelectrons are emitted).
- **Cu**: \( \lambda_0 = 311 \, \text{nm} \) (all visible light wavelengths are greater than \( 311 \, \text{nm} \), so no photoelectrons are emitted).
- **K**: \( \lambda_0 = 552 \, \text{nm} \) (visible light includes wavelengths shorter than \( 552 \, \text{nm} \), so photoelectrons are emitted).
- **Zn**: \( \lambda_0 = 343 \, \text{nm} \) (all visible light wavelengths are greater than \( 343 \, \text{nm} \), so no photoelectrons are emitted).

### Conclusion
The metals that will not emit photoelectrons when illuminated with visible light are **Cu and Zn**.
