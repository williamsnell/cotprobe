Okay, so I need to figure out which of the boys on the TV show 'My Three Sons' is adopted. The options are A to J, with names like Danny, Sam, Charlie, and others. I'm a bit rusty on my TV show details, but I'll try to recall what I know.

First, I remember that 'My Three Sons' had a main family with three boys. The parents were played by Fred MacMurray and Myrna Loy. The boys were named Chip, Robbie, and Billy, if I'm not mistaken. Wait, but I'm not sure about each of their backstories.

I think the show had some storylines where one of the boys was adopted. I remember something about Chip being the adopted one. Maybe his biological parents were different, and he was adopted by the family. Alternatively, I think one of the sons had a different last name, which might indicate adoption.

Let me think about the characters. There was Chip, who I believe was the oldest. He was portrayed as a bit more mature and responsible. I think his storyline involved him being adopted, perhaps by the main character, Steve, or maybe another parent. Wait, no, the parents were named Steve and Laura, I think. Or was it Fred and Myrna? Wait, no, Fred MacMurray played the father, Steve, and Myrna Loy was the mother Laura.

Wait, no, correction: Fred MacMurray played the father, but the character's name was Steve. So the father was Steve, and the mother was Laura. The sons were Chip, Robbie, and Billy. So the three sons were Chip, Robbie, and Billy.

I think Chip had a different last name or some indication that he was adopted. Alternatively, I remember that in some episodes, there was a mention of Chip being adopted by Steve and Laura. So that would make Chip the adopted one.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: I think one of the sons had a different surname, but I can't recall. Alternatively, maybe it's Robbie who's adopted because his storylines sometimes involved his biological parents.

Alternatively, I might be confusing it with another show. Let me try to visualize the cast. Fred MacMurray as the father, Myrna Loy as the mother, and the boys: Chip, Robbie, and Billy. I think Chip was the adopted one, as he was the oldest and had a more serious role.

So putting it all together, I think the answer is Chip, which is option G.

The correct answer is G: Chip.
