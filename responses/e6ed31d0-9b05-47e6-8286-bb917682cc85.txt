Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here about finding the entropy change when an ideal gas expands under constant pressure. Hmm, I remember that entropy change for an ideal gas can be calculated using certain formulas depending on the process. Since the pressure is constant and the volume changes, I think it's an isobaric process.

Wait, the formula for entropy change when pressure is constant is ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1), right? Or wait, maybe it's in terms of temperature? No, because here the volume is changing, not the temperature. Oh wait, when dealing with entropy changes, if it's at constant pressure, we can use the formula ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1) + nCp ln(T2/T1), but in this case, since it's only volume changing, maybe the temperature change is not considered, or perhaps it's an isothermal process? No, no, the question says it's under constant pressure, so it's definitely an isobaric process, not isothermal.

Wait, but for an ideal gas at constant pressure, the entropy change should only depend on the volume change because for an ideal gas, PV = nRT, so if P is constant, then TV is proportional. So maybe I can express it in terms of volume alone.

Alternatively, I think the general formula for entropy change is ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1) + nCv ln(T2/T1), but wait, that's when the process is not necessarily at constant pressure. Oh wait, no, that's when you're using the two-variable formula, but when pressure is constant, perhaps it's easier to use the formula that directly involves pressure and volume.

Alternatively, another formula I remember is ΔS = nR ln(P1 V1 / P2 V2). Because entropy change for ideal gas can be expressed as ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1) + nR ln(T2/T1), but since PV = nRT, T can be expressed in terms of P and V. Alternatively, since the process is at constant pressure, let's think about the integral.

The formula for entropy change when pressure is constant is ΔS = ∫(dQ_rev)/T. For an ideal gas, the heat transfer at constant pressure is dQ = nCp dT. Wait, no, wait. At constant pressure, the heat transfer is dQ = nCp dT, but wait, for entropy, it's better to use the differential form. Alternatively, for a reversible process at constant pressure, the entropy change is given by ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1) + nCp ln(T2/T1). But since the process is isobaric, and the gas is ideal, perhaps the temperature change can be related to the volume change.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Another approach is to use the formula for entropy change when pressure and volume change: ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1) + nCv ln(T2/T1). But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, since the process is at constant pressure, perhaps I can relate the entropy change using the formula ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1) + nR ln(T2/T1), because for ideal gases, the entropy change can be expressed as ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1) + nR ln(T2/T1) = nR ln((V2 T2)/(V1 T1)).

But wait, since the process is at constant pressure, from the ideal gas law PV = nRT, so V is proportional to T when P is constant. So V1 = nRT1/P and V2 = nRT2/P. So V2/V1 = T2/T1. Therefore, T2 = (V2/V1) T1.

Now, substituting back into the entropy formula: ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1) + nR ln(T2/T1) = nR ln(V2/V1) + nR ln(V2/V1) = 2nR ln(V2/V1). So ΔS = 2nR ln(V2/V1). But wait, the options are given in terms of Nk, since N is the number of molecules. Oh right, because R is Nk, where N is Avogadro's number and k is Boltzmann's constant. So substituting R = Nk, we get ΔS = 2Nk ln(V2/V1).

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check. Option C is (2/2)Nk ln(V2/V1). Simplifying (2/2) is 1, so that would be Nk ln(V2/V1). Hmm, that doesn't match my result of 2Nk ln(V2/V1). Did I make a mistake in the derivation?

Wait, perhaps I confused the formula. Let me think again. The entropy change for an ideal gas under constant pressure can be calculated using the formula ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1) + nCp ln(T2/T1). But wait, Cp for an ideal monatomic gas is (5/2)R, and for diatomic, it's (7/2)R, but the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps it's a general case.

Wait, but I think I should stick to the formula when pressure is constant. Alternatively, another approach is to use the formula for entropy change when the process is isobaric: ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1) + nCp ln(T2/T1). But since the process is at constant pressure, the temperature change can be determined from the volume change using the ideal gas law. So since PV = nRT, and P is constant, V is proportional to T. So T2 = T1 (V2/V1). So ln(T2/T1) = ln(V2/V1).

Substituting into the entropy change formula: ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1) + nCp ln(V2/V1) = [nR + nCp] ln(V2/V1) = n(R + Cp) ln(V2/V1).

But for an ideal gas, Cp = (f/2) R, where f is the degrees of freedom. For monatomic gas, f=3, so Cp=(5/2)R. Wait, no, wait: Cp = (γ-1) R, where γ = Cp/Cv. Wait, for a monatomic gas, Cp = (5/2) R, because Cv is (3/2) R. So for a monatomic gas, R + Cp = R + (5/2)R = (7/2) R.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify whether it's monatomic or diatomic. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula when pressure is constant is ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1) + nCp ln(T2/T1). But since T2 = T1 (V2/V1), because P is constant, then ln(T2/T1) = ln(V2/V1).

So ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1) + nCp ln(V2/V1) = n(R + Cp) ln(V2/V1).

So substituting Cp = (f/2) R, but without knowing f, perhaps the general formula is (γ) nR ln(V2/V1), but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. The entropy change for an ideal gas can also be calculated using ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1) + nCv ln(T2/T1). But since in this case, the process is at constant pressure, and using the ideal gas law, T is proportional to V, so T2 = T1 * (V2/V1). Therefore, ln(T2/T1) = ln(V2/V1). So substituting:

ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1) + nCv ln(V2/V1) = n(R + Cv) ln(V2/V1).

But for an ideal gas, Cv = (f/2) R. So R + Cv = R + (f/2) R = R(1 + f/2).

Now, for monatomic gas, f=3, so R(1+3/2) = (5/2) R. So ΔS = n*(5/2 R) ln(V2/V1). But wait, n R is Nk, since R = Nk. So n R = Nk. So substituting, ΔS = Nk (5/2) ln(V2/V1) = (5/2) Nk ln(V2/V1).

Looking at the options, option D is (5/2)Nk1n (V2/V1). Wait, but in the options, the notation might be a typo. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: (4/2)Nk1n (V2/V1)
B: (7/2)Nk1n (V2/V1)
C: (2/2)Nk ln (V2/V1)
D: (5/2)Nk1n (V2/V1)
E: Nk ln (V_1/V_2)
F: (1/2)Nk ln (V_2/V_1)
G: (3/2)Nk1n (V2/V1)
H: (6/2)Nk ln (V2/V1)
I: (8/2)Nk ln (V2/V1)
J: (3/2)Nk ln (V1/V2)

Wait, option D says (5/2)Nk1n (V2/V1), which looks like a typo. The '1n' might be intended as ln. So option D is (5/2)Nk ln(V2/V1). That matches what I derived for a monatomic gas. But the problem doesn't specify the type of gas. Hmm, but wait, in the case of constant pressure, the entropy change is ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1) + nCp ln(T2/T1). Since T2/T1 = V2/V1 (because P is constant), then ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1) + nCp ln(V2/V1) = n(R + Cp) ln(V2/V1).

Cp for an ideal gas is (γ) Cv, and since γ = Cp/Cv, and for monatomic gas, γ=5/3, so Cp = (5/3) Cv, and Cv = (3/2) R, so Cp = (5/2) R. So R + Cp = R + (5/2) R = (7/2) R. Therefore, ΔS = n (7/2) R ln(V2/V1) = (7/2) Nk ln(V2/V1), since nR = Nk.

Wait, so that would make ΔS = (7/2) Nk ln(V2/V1), which is option B. But earlier I thought it was 5/2, but that was using Cv instead of Cp. So I must have made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me clarify. The correct formula for entropy change when pressure is constant is:

ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1) + nCp ln(T2/T1).

But since T2 = T1 * (V2/V1) (because PV = nRT → T = PV/(nR), so at constant P, T ∝ V), then:

ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1) + nCp ln(V2/V1) = [nR + nCp] ln(V2/V1).

So it's (R + Cp) * n ln(V2/V1).

Now, for an ideal gas, Cp = (γ) Cv, and Cv = (f/2) R. So Cp = (γ) (f/2 R). But γ = Cp/Cv = (f/2 R) / ( (f-2)/2 R ) )= f/(f-2). So Cp = (f/(f-2)) * (f-2)/2 R) = (f/2) R.

Wait, for monatomic gas, f=3, so Cp = (3/2) R * (γ) where γ=5/3? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me just recall that for monatomic gases, Cv = (3/2) R, so Cp = Cv + R = (5/2) R. So R + Cp = R + (5/2) R = (7/2) R.

Therefore, ΔS = n (7/2 R) ln(V2/V1) = (7/2) Nk ln(V2/V1), since nR = Nk.

So the correct answer would be option B: (7/2) Nk ln(V2/V1).

Wait, but looking back at the options, option B is (7/2)Nk1n (V2/V1). The '1n' is probably a typo, meaning ln. So option B is correct.

But wait, earlier I thought the formula was ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1) + nCp ln(T2/T1), and since T2/T1 = V2/V1, that gives [nR + nCp] ln(V2/V1). So with Cp = (5/2) R, the total becomes (7/2) R n ln(V2/V1), which is (7/2) Nk ln(V2/V1).

So the correct answer should be option B.

The entropy change for an ideal gas undergoing an isobaric expansion can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\Delta S = nR \ln\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right) + nC_p \ln\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)
\]

Since the process occurs at constant pressure, the ideal gas law \( PV = nRT \) implies that \( T \propto V \), so \( \frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{V_2}{V_1} \). Substituting this into the formula gives:

\[
\Delta S = nR \ln\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right) + nC_p \ln\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right) = n(R + C_p) \ln\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right)
\]

For an ideal gas, \( C_p = \frac{f}{2}R \), where \( f \) is the degrees of freedom. For monatomic gases (\( f = 3 \)), \( C_p = \frac{5}{2}R \), so:

\[
R + C_p = R + \frac{5}{2}R = \frac{7}{2}R
\]

Thus, the entropy change becomes:

\[
\Delta S = n\left(\frac{7}{2}R\right) \ln\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right)
\]

Since \( R = Nk \), where \( N \) is Avogadro's number and \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, substituting \( R \) gives:

\[
\Delta S = \frac{7}{2}Nk \ln\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right)
\]

Examining the options, the correct choice matches this result. The notation in option B, \((7/2)Nk1n (V_2/V_1)\), likely has a typo where "1n" should be "ln". Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
