Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about reinforcement schedules. The question is about Soledad, who answers every email her friend sends. I need to determine which schedule of reinforcement she's using, and the options are from A to J.

First, I should remember what each type of reinforcement schedule means. I think there are different kinds like fixed ratio, variable ratio, fixed interval, variable interval, continuous reinforcement, extinction, negative reinforcement, and punishment. There's also differential reinforcement, which I'm a bit fuzzy on.

The question says Soledad answers every email. So, every time her friend sends an email, she responds. That seems like every single instance is being reinforced. In operant conditioning terms, continuous reinforcement is when a behavior is reinforced every time it occurs. So, if she gets a reward (maybe a response from her friend) every time she does the behavior (sending an email), that's continuous reinforcement.

Let me think about the other options to make sure I'm not mixing things up. Fixed ratio would be a set number of responses before reinforcement, like every 5th email. But here, it's every email. Variable ratio is unpredictable, like slot machines, so that doesn't fit. Fixed interval is a set time, like checking emails every hour, but the question is about every message. Extinction is when the reinforcement stops, which isn't the case here. Punishment is when a behavior is followed by an aversive stimulus, which doesn't apply because she's getting positive responses. Negative reinforcement is removing an aversive, but again, not relevant here. Differential reinforcement is about reinforcing different behaviors based on some criteria, which doesn't fit.

So, the key here is that every email gets a response, so it's continuous reinforcement. The answer should be option B.

The correct answer is continuous reinforcement because Soledad responds to every email, meaning the behavior is reinforced every time it occurs.

Answer: B
