Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the partial-fraction expansion of F(s) = (8s + 2)/(s² + 3s + 2). Hmm, partial fractions. I remember that this involves breaking down a complicated rational function into simpler fractions that are easier to work with, especially for inverse Laplace transforms or other operations.

First, I should factor the denominator. The denominator is s² + 3s + 2. Let me factor that. Looking for two numbers that multiply to 2 and add up to 3. That would be 1 and 2. So, the denominator factors into (s + 1)(s + 2). So, F(s) becomes (8s + 2)/[(s + 1)(s + 2)].

Now, the partial fraction decomposition will express this as A/(s + 1) + B/(s + 2), where A and B are constants I need to find.

So, setting up the equation: (8s + 2)/[(s + 1)(s + 2)] = A/(s + 1) + B/(s + 2).

To find A and B, I can multiply both sides by (s + 1)(s + 2) to eliminate the denominators. That gives:

8s + 2 = A(s + 2) + B(s + 1).

Now, I need to solve for A and B. One method is to expand the right side and then equate the coefficients of like terms on both sides.

Expanding the right side: A*s + 2A + B*s + B = (A + B)s + (2A + B).

Now, equate the coefficients from the left side (8s + 2) to the right side:

For the s term: 8 = A + B.
For the constant term: 2 = 2A + B.

So now I have a system of two equations:
1. A + B = 8
2. 2A + B = 2

I can solve this system. Let's subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate B:

(2A + B) - (A + B) = 2 - 8
2A + B - A - B = -6
A = -6.

Wait, that doesn't seem right because if A is -6, then from equation 1, B = 8 - (-6) = 14. Let me check that.

Plugging A = -6 into equation 1: -6 + B = 8 → B = 14.

Wait, but let's verify by plugging back into the original equation. Let's compute A(s+2) + B(s+1) with A=-6 and B=14.

-6(s + 2) +14(s +1) = -6s -12 +14s +14 = ( -6s +14s ) + ( -12 +14 ) = 8s + 2. Yes, that matches the left side. So A is -6 and B is 14.

So the partial fractions are F(s) = (-6)/(s +1) +14/(s +2).

Looking at the options, which one matches this? Let me see the options again.

Option H: F(s) = [(-6)/(s+1)] + [14/(s+2)].

Yes, that's exactly what I got. So the correct answer should be H.

The partial-fraction expansion of F(s) is found by factoring the denominator and solving for constants A and B. The decomposition results in F(s) = (-6)/(s +1) +14/(s +2), which corresponds to option H.
