Okay, so I need to find the gravitational force between Earth and the Moon. Hmm, I remember that the formula for gravitational force is F = G * (M * m) / r². Right, where G is the gravitational constant, M and m are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between their centers.

Let me jot down the given values. Earth's mass is 5.97 × 10²⁴ kg, Moon's mass is 7.35 × 10²² kg. The distance between them is 3.84 × 10⁵ km. Wait, but the units for r need to be in meters, right? Because G is usually in m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻². So I should convert that distance from kilometers to meters. 

3.84 × 10⁵ km is the same as 3.84 × 10⁵ × 10³ meters, which is 3.84 × 10⁸ meters. Got that.

Now, the gravitational constant G is 6.674 × 10⁻¹¹ N(m/kg)². I think that's correct. Or wait, sometimes it's written as 6.67 × 10⁻¹¹ for simplicity. Close enough, I think.

So plugging the numbers into the formula: F = (6.67e-11) * (5.97e24 kg * 7.35e22 kg) / (3.84e8 m)². Let me compute this step by step.

First, calculate the numerator: 5.97e24 * 7.35e22. Let me multiply 5.97 and 7.35. 5 *7 is 35, 0.97*7 is about 6.79, 5*0.35 is 1.75, and 0.97*0.35 is around 0.3395. Wait, maybe I should just compute 5.97 *7.35. Let me do that more accurately.

5.97 *7.35: 5*7 is 35, 5*0.35 is 1.75, 0.97*7 is 6.79, 0.97*0.35 is 0.3395. Wait, maybe better to do it as (5 + 0.97) * (7 + 0.35) = 5*7 +5*0.35 +0.97*7 +0.97*0.35. 

5*7=35, 5*0.35=1.75, 0.97*7=6.79, 0.97*0.35≈0.3395. Adding all together: 35 +1.75=36.75; 36.75 +6.79=43.54; 43.54 +0.3395≈43.8795. So 5.97*7.35≈43.8795.

Now, considering the exponents: 10^24 *10^22 = 10^46. So the numerator becomes 43.8795e46 kg².

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 5.97e24 *7.35e22 = (5.97*7.35) *10^(24+22) = approximately 43.88 *10^46 = 4.388e47 kg².

Wait, wait, 5.97e24 times 7.35e22 is (5.97 *7.35) *1e(24+22) = about 43.88 *1e46, which is 4.388e47 kg². Hmm, I think I messed up the decimal point placement. Let me double-check. 5.97e24 *7.35e22 = (5.97 *7.35) *10^(24+22) = (approx 43.88) *1e46 = 4.388e47 kg². Yeah, that's correct.

Now, the denominator is (3.84e8 m)^2. Let me compute that. (3.84)^2 is about 14.7456, and (1e8)^2 is 1e16. So the denominator is 14.7456e16 = 1.47456e17 m².

So now, F = (6.67e-11) * (4.388e47) / (1.47456e17).

Let me compute the numerator and denominator first: (4.388e47) / (1.47456e17) = (4.388 /1.47456) *10^(47-17) = approximately 2.975 *1e30 = 2.975e30.

Then multiply by 6.67e-11: 2.975e30 *6.67e-11 = (2.975 *6.67) *1e(30-11) = let's compute 2.975 *6.67.

2 *6.67 is 13.34, 0.975 *6.67 is approximately 6.51375. So total is about 13.34 +6.51375 =19.85375.

So 19.85375e19 = 1.985375e20 N. So F≈1.985e20 N. Now, looking at the options, the closest value is option G: 1.99, but wait, the options are X *10^20 N. So X is approximately 1.985, which is close to 1.99, but let me check if I did the calculations correctly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication earlier. Let me recheck the numerator and denominator.

Wait, 5.97e24 *7.35e22 = 5.97 *7.35 = let me compute that more accurately. 5*7=35, 5*.35=1.75, .97*7=6.79, .97*.35=0.3395. So 35 +1.75=36.75, +6.79=43.54, +0.3395=43.8795. So 43.8795e46, which is 4.38795e47.

Denominator: (3.84e8)^2 = (3.84)^2= 14.7456, so 14.7456e16 =1.47456e17.

So 4.38795e47 / 1.47456e17 = (4.38795 /1.47456) *1e30.

Calculating 4.38795 ÷ 1.47456: Let's see, 1.47456 *3=4.42368, which is a bit more than 4.38795. So 3 would be too high. Let me compute 1.47456 *2.975 = approximately 1.47456 *3 =4.42368. Subtract 0.025 *1.47456=0.036864. So 4.42368 -0.036864=4.386816. That's very close to 4.38795. So 2.975 gives us 4.386816, which is just under 4.38795. So the division is approximately 2.975.

So 2.975e30 kg²/m². Now multiply by G=6.67e-11.

2.975e30 *6.67e-11 = (2.975 *6.67) *1e19.

2.975 *6.67: Let's compute that accurately. 2*6=12, 2*0.67=1.34, 0.975*6=5.85, 0.975*0.67≈0.65475. Adding all together: 12 +1.34=13.34; 13.34 +5.85=19.19; 19.19 +0.65475≈19.84475.

So 19.84475e19 N = 1.984475e20 N. So X is approximately 1.9845, which is closest to option G: 1.99, but looking at the options, option J is 2.05, which is a bit higher. Wait, no, the options are:

A: 1.92
B: 2.00
C: 2.10
D: 1.85
E: 1.80
F: 2.15
G: 1.99
H: 1.75
I: 2.08
J: 2.05

Wait, 1.9845 is very close to 1.98, which isn't exactly an option. The closest option would be G:1.99, but perhaps I made an error in calculations. Let me check again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise numbers. Let me redo the calculation with more precise steps.

Compute the product of the masses: 5.97e24 kg *7.35e22 kg = (5.97 *7.35) *1e(24+22) = (5.97 *7.35) *1e46.

5.97 *7.35 = let's compute it accurately.

5.97 × 7 = 41.79
5.97 × 0.35 = 2.0895
Adding together: 41.79 +2.0895 = 43.8795

So 43.8795e46 = 4.38795e47 kg².

Distance squared: (3.84e8 m)^2 = (3.84)^2 *1e16 = 14.7456e16 = 1.47456e17 m².

Now, F = (6.674e-11) * (4.38795e47) / (1.47456e17).

Compute the division first: 4.38795e47 /1.47456e17 = (4.38795 /1.47456) *1e30.

4.38795 ÷1.47456 ≈2.975 (as before), so 2.975e30.

Now multiply by G: 6.674e-11 *2.975e30 = (6.674 *2.975) *1e19.

Calculate 6.674 ×2.975:

Let me compute this:

6 ×2.975 =17.85
0.674 ×2.975 ≈2.00865 (since 0.674×3=2.022, but subtracting 0.674×0.025=0.01685 gives 2.00515)

So total ≈17.85 +2.00515=19.85515.

So 19.85515e19 N =1.985515e20 N.

So X is approximately 1.9855, which rounds to 1.99, so option G is 1.99. But wait, looking at the options, the closest is G:1.99, but sometimes the precise calculation might differ slightly. Alternatively, perhaps using more accurate values for G or the masses could change it a tiny bit.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation using precise values would give a slightly different result. Let me try with more precise G: 6.67430e-11 N·m²/kg².

So F = (6.6743e-11) * (5.97e24 *7.35e22) / (3.84e8)^2.

Compute 5.97e24 *7.35e22 =5.97 *7.35 =43.8795, so 43.8795e46=4.38795e47.

Denominator: (3.84e8)^2=1.47456e17.

So F = (6.6743e-11) * (4.38795e47) / (1.47456e17).

Compute 4.38795e47 /1.47456e17 = (4.38795 /1.47456)e30 ≈2.975e30.

Multiply by 6.6743e-11: 2.975e30 *6.6743e-11 = (2.975 *6.6743)e19.

2.975 *6.6743: let's compute this more accurately.

2 *6.6743 =13.3486
0.975 *6.6743:

Compute 0.975 *6 =5.85
0.975 *0.6743 ≈0.6583 (since 0.975 *0.6=0.585, 0.975 *0.0743≈0.0724, total≈0.6574)
So 0.975 *6.6743 ≈5.85 +0.6574≈6.5074.

So total 13.3486 +6.5074=19.856.

So F≈19.856e19=1.9856e20 N. So X≈1.9856, which is approximately 1.99, so option G:1.99.

To calculate the gravitational force between Earth and the Moon, we use the formula:

\[
F = G \cdot \frac{M \cdot m}{r^2}
\]

Where:
- \( G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{kg}^2 \)
- \( M = 5.97 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg} \) (Earth's mass)
- \( m = 7.35 \times 10^{22} \, \text{kg} \) (Moon's mass)
- \( r = 3.84 \times 10^8 \, \text{m} \) (distance between Earth and Moon)

### Step 1: Compute the product of the masses
\[
M \cdot m = (5.97 \times 10^{24}) \cdot (7.35 \times 10^{22}) = 4.38795 \times 10^{47} \, \text{kg}^2
\]

### Step 2: Compute the square of the distance
\[
r^2 = (3.84 \times 10^8)^2 = 1.47456 \times 10^{17} \, \text{m}^2
\]

### Step 3: Divide the product of the masses by the square of the distance
\[
\frac{M \cdot m}{r^2} = \frac{4.38795 \times 10^{47}}{1.47456 \times 10^{17}} = 2.975 \times 10^{30}
\]

### Step 4: Multiply by the gravitational constant
\[
F = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \cdot 2.975 \times 10^{30} = 1.9856 \times 10^{20} \, \text{N}
\]

### Step 5: Determine \( X \)
The gravitational force is \( 1.9856 \times 10^{20} \, \text{N} \), so \( X \approx 1.9856 \). The closest option is:

**G: 1.99**
