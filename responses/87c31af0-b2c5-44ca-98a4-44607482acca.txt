Question:

Options:

A: cell-surface receptors

Okay, so I've got this question about cellular uptake of cholesterol, and I need to figure out which option is the exception. Let me start by recalling what I know about how cholesterol is taken into cells.

From what I remember, cholesterol in the blood is carried by low-density lipoproteins (LDL), often referred to as "bad" cholesterol. When cells need cholesterol, they take it in from the bloodstream. The process involves specific receptors on the cell surface.

So the first step is that the LDL cholesterol complexes bind to receptors on the cell membrane. These receptors are probably part of the cell-surface machinery, so option A (cell-surface receptors) is definitely involved. That means A is not the exception; the question is asking which one is NOT involved.

Next, after the LDL binds to the receptors, the cell uses endocytosis to bring the complex into the cell. I think this is a type of endocytosis called receptor-mediated endocytosis, which is option D. So D is involved, so D isn't the answer either.

When the LDL is internalized, it's taken into a structure called an endosome. The endosome forms as a vesicle that encloses the LDL-receptor complex. So endosome formation, option C, is part of the process. That means C isn't the exception.

Now, option B is adhesion plaques. Hmm, I'm not as sure about this one. Adhesion plaques are structures in cells, usually found in areas like the immune system, where they help in the formation of structures like the synapse in immune cells. They're involved in things like the clustering of receptors and facilitating internalization. But wait, in the context of LDL uptake, do adhesion plaques play a role?

I think that adhesion plaques are more associated with other types of receptors, maybe like the ones involved in signal transduction or other endocytic processes, but I'm not certain if they're part of the LDL uptake mechanism. Alternatively, I might be confusing them with something else, like caveolae. Caveolae are small vesicles involved in endocytosis and are sometimes associated with adhesion molecules.

Wait, another thought. Adhesion plaques are structures where cells adhere to each other or to the extracellular matrix. But in the context of LDL uptake, I don't recall adhesion plaques being directly involved. The main players are the receptors, the endosome formation, and receptor-mediated endocytosis.

So putting it all together, the process involves cell-surface receptors (A), endosome formation (C), and receptor-mediated endocytosis (D). The one that's not involved is adhesion plaques (B). Therefore, the answer should be option B.

The cellular uptake of cholesterol via low-density lipoprotein (LDL) complexes involves several steps. LDL binds to cell-surface receptors, which are essential for initiating the process (A). This binding triggers receptor-mediated endocytosis (D), where the LDL-receptor complex is internalized into the cell. As part of this process, an endosome forms to enclose the complex (C). However, adhesion plaques (B) are not directly involved in this pathway. Adhesion plaques are typically associated with cell-cell interactions or other signaling processes but are not part of the LDL cholesterol uptake mechanism.

Answer: B
