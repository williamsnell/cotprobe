Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out how much work is done when a mass of 5 kilograms is raised a height of 2 meters. Hmm, I remember from school that work done against gravity involves some formula, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I recall that work done (W) is generally calculated by the formula W = Force × Distance. That makes sense because work is essentially the transfer of energy through force over a distance. But wait, what's the force here? Oh right, when you lift something against gravity, the force you're applying is equal to the weight of the object. Weight is mass times gravity, right? So the formula for weight is W = m × g, where m is mass and g is acceleration due to gravity.

The mass given is 5 kilograms, and I think the standard value for gravity near the Earth's surface is approximately 9.8 m/s². So let me calculate the weight first. That would be 5 kg multiplied by 9.8 m/s². Let me do that multiplication: 5 times 9 is 45, and 5 times 0.8 is 4, so adding them gives 49. So the weight is 49 Newtons. Wait, but is that correct? Because 5 times 9.8 is actually 49 N, yes.

Now, the work done is the force (which is the weight here) multiplied by the distance lifted. The distance is 2 meters. So W = F × d = 49 N × 2 m. Let's calculate that: 49 times 2 is 98. So the work done should be 98 joules because 1 joule is 1 Newton-meter.

Looking at the options, option J is 98 joules. So that should be the correct answer. But wait, let me double-check if I used the right formula. Work done against gravity is indeed mgh, where h is height. So another way to think about it is W = m × g × h. Plugging in the numbers: 5 kg × 9.8 m/s² × 2 m. That's 5 × 9.8 = 49, then 49 × 2 = 98. Yep, same result. So I'm confident that the answer is J, 98 joules.

The work done is calculated using the formula \( W = m \times g \times h \). Substituting the given values: \( 5 \, \text{kg} \times 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \times 2 \, \text{m} = 98 \, \text{J} \).

Answer: J
