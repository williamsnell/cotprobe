Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the commoners in rural Aztec villages called Capilco and Cuexcomate. I'm a bit rusty on Aztec history, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the Aztec empire was quite centrally controlled. The emperor, or Huey Tlatoani, had a lot of power, and the people were expected to pay tribute. But I'm not sure about the specifics here.

Looking at the options:

A: High tax in goods and labor to the local governor. Hmm, I think the Aztecs had a system where people paid tribute, but maybe it was more to the central authority than just the local governor. I'm not certain.

B: Constant threat of being sold into slavery. I don't recall commoners being in constant fear of slavery. Slavery was more for war captives, I think, or those who couldn't pay debts. Not sure if it was a daily threat.

C: Left alone and did fairly well. That seems unlikely because the Aztecs were known for extracting resources from their subjects. So commoners probably weren't left alone.

D: Under the high priest's control, regular sacrifices. High priests did handle religious aspects, but direct control over villages? I'm not sure. Sacrifices were more for the state religion, maybe not every village.

E: Heavily policed to prevent uprisings. The Aztecs did have a military presence, but I'm not sure if they were heavily policed in the villages. Maybe more in the cities.

F: Ruled by iron fist with armies stationed. That sounds a bit too much. Maybe the king's control was more indirect through local leaders.

G: Forced to send half maize to king, absolute poverty. Half seems like a lot, but I remember that tribute was a significant burden. If they sent half their maize, that would leave them with barely enough, leading to poverty. This might be correct.

H: Send all children to city schools. Commoners usually didn't get much education; it was more for the elite. So this option seems unlikely.

I: No protection from northern invasions. The Aztecs were a major power, so they probably provided protection, though maybe not always.

J: Forced to work on irrigation for king. Irrigation was important, but I think that was more of a community effort, maybe not directly forced by the king.

So, considering all this, option G seems plausible. The Aztecs required tribute, which could include maize. If they had to send half, that would leave them in poverty. I'm leaning towards G, but I'm not 100% certain.

The commoners in rural Aztec villages like Capilco and Cuexcomate faced significant burdens due to the tribute system. They were required to send a substantial portion of their crops, such as maize, to the king, which often left them in poverty. This aligns with option G, which describes the forced contribution of half their maize and resulting hardship.

Answer: G
