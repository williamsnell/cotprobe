<think>
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the depth of penetration of a plane wave in copper. Hmm, I remember that when a wave hits a conductor, it doesn't just stop at the surface; it penetrates a little bit before being reflected. That's called the skin depth, right? The question gives me the conductivity (σ) and the magnetic permeability (μ) of copper, along with the frequency of the wave. I need to find the depth of penetration, which is usually given by this formula I think: δ = 1 / sqrt(μσ) multiplied by the square root of 2 divided by π, wait no, wait. Or is it just δ = 1/(sqrt(μσ)) multiplied by some factor?

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think. Oh right, the skin depth δ is given by δ = 1/(√(μσ)) * sqrt( (π f)^2 + ... no, wait, maybe I'm confusing it with the impedance. Wait, no, for a good conductor, the skin depth simplifies because the term involving frequency is negligible. Or is that when the frequency is high? Wait, but here the frequency is 200 Hz, which is pretty low. Hmm, but copper is a good conductor, so maybe the formula is still applicable.

Wait, the standard formula for skin depth is δ = 1/(√(μσ)) multiplied by something else. Oh wait, no, the general formula for the attenuation depth (which is the depth of penetration) is δ = 1/(√(μσ)) * (1/√(1 + (ωμσ)^(-1)) )) )? No, maybe I'm getting mixed up. Alternatively, I think the formula is δ = 1 / sqrt(μσ) ) * ( 1 / sqrt(1 + (ωμ)^2 σ^2 ) ) )? Or perhaps it's δ = 1/(sqrt(μσ)) multiplied by the reciprocal of sqrt( (ωμ)^2 + (σ)^2 ), but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall. The wave's attenuation in a conductor is described by the complex propagation constant β = jβ, where β is the attenuation constant. The skin depth δ is 1/β. The propagation constant β is given by sqrt( (ωμ)^2 + (σ)^2 ) * j, so β = j sqrt( (ωμ)^2 + σ^2 ). Therefore, δ = 1/(sqrt( (ωμ)^2 + σ^2 )) ) * 1. Because β = j sqrt(...), so 1/β is 1/(j sqrt(...)) = -j / sqrt(...), but since δ is the magnitude, it's 1/sqrt(...). 

Wait, but sometimes the formula is written as δ = 1/(sqrt(μσ)) ) * sqrt( (μσ)^2 + (μω)^2 ) )^{-1/2} }? No, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should approach it differently.

Wait, another approach: the wave number in a conductor is k = sqrt( (ωμ)^2 + (σ/ω)^2 ). Hmm, no, perhaps I'm mixing up formulas. Alternatively, the wave's attenuation is given by α = (1/2) sqrt( (ωμ)^2 + (σ)^2 ), and the skin depth δ is 1/α. So δ = 2 / sqrt( (ωμ)^2 + σ^2 ). Or wait, maybe I'm misremembering. Let me think again.

Oh wait, the standard formula for the depth of penetration (δ) is given by δ = 1 / sqrt(μ * σ), but that's when the frequency is such that the term involving frequency is negligible. Alternatively, the general formula is δ = 1 / sqrt( μ * σ ) multiplied by 1/(sqrt(1 + (ω μ σ )^2 )), but that seems complicated. Alternatively, I think that the formula is δ = (1/ sqrt(μσ)) ) * (1/ sqrt(1 + (ω μ σ )^(-2) )) ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should just look up the formula again. Oh wait, I can't look it up now, but I'll try to derive it. Maxwell's equations for a conductor lead to the wave equation with attenuation. The wave's electric field E and magnetic field H decay exponentially with depth, with an exponential factor of exp(-α z), where α is the attenuation constant. The α is given by α = sqrt( (ωμ)^2 + σ^2 ) / 2. So the skin depth δ is 1/α, so δ = 2 / sqrt( (ωμ)^2 + σ^2 ). Alternatively, sometimes the formula is written as δ = 1 / sqrt(μσ) * ( 1 / sqrt( 1 + (ωμσ)^(-2) ) ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The intrinsic impedance η of a conductor is given by η = sqrt(μ/σ). The wave impedance Z is η0 / η, where η0 is the impedance of free space. But maybe that's not directly helpful here.

Wait, let me think again. The general expression for the skin depth δ is δ = 1/(sqrt(μσ)) * (1/ sqrt(1 + (ωμσ)^2 )) ) ? No, that doesn't seem right because when σ is very high (good conductor), the term (ωμσ) would be large, making the denominator approximately ωμσ, leading to δ ≈ 1/(sqrt(μσ)) * 1/(ωμσ) ) which would be a very small number, which makes sense because the skin depth should be very small in good conductors. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula δ = 1/(sqrt(μσ)) * (1/ sqrt(1 + (ωμσ)^(-2) )) ). Let me plug in the numbers and see.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula δ = 1/(sqrt(μσ)) ) * (1/ sqrt( (ωμ)^2 + (σ)^2 ) ) ). No, that would give δ = 1/(sqrt(μσ) * sqrt( (ωμ)^2 + σ^2 )) ), which seems complicated. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, another approach: The formula for the depth of penetration is δ = (1/μσ) multiplied by something. Wait, perhaps the formula is δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) * (something). Alternatively, I think the correct formula is δ = 1/(sqrt(μσ)) ) * (1/ sqrt(1 + (ωμσ)^2 )) ) ? No, I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should just use the standard formula I remember, which is δ = 1/(sqrt(μσ)) ) multiplied by something, but I'm not recalling it correctly. Alternatively, maybe I should look for the formula in terms of ω, μ, and σ.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the skin depth δ is given by δ = 1/(sqrt(μσ)) * (1/ sqrt(1 + (ωμσ)^2 )) ). Hmm, but I'm not confident about that. Alternatively, perhaps it's δ = 1/(sqrt(μσ)) ) * (1/(ωμσ)) ), but that would be when the frequency term is dominant. Wait, maybe I'm confusing it with the cutoff condition.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is δ = 1/(sqrt(μσ)) ) multiplied by 1/(sqrt(1 + (ωμσ)^(-2) )) ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should use dimensional analysis. The units of μ are H/m (henrys per meter), and σ is S/m (siemens per meter). So μ has units of H/m = (V s/A m) per meter, which is V s/(A m²). σ is S/m = (A/V)/m = A/(V·m). So μ*σ has units (V s/(A m²)) * (A/(V·m)) ) = (V s * A ) / (A m² * V m ) ) = s/(m^3). So sqrt(μσ) would have units sqrt(s/m^3) ) = s^(1/2)/m^(3/2). Hmm, but that doesn't make sense because δ should have units of meters.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me compute μσ again. μ is H/m = (kg·m²/(s²·A²))/m = kg·m/(s²·A²). σ is S/m = (A/V)/m = (A·s)/(V·m) ) because V = J/C = (kg·m²/s²)/C, and C is A·s, so V = kg·m²/(s³·A). So σ = (A) * s/(kg·m²/(s³·A) * m ) ) → Hmm, maybe better to think in terms of base SI units.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the formula. Let me try plugging the numbers in, using the formula δ = 1/(sqrt(μσ)) * (1/ sqrt(1 + (ωμσ)^2 )) ), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the correct formula is δ = 1/(sqrt(μσ)) * (1/ sqrt(1 + (ωμ σ )^2 )) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) ) / sqrt(1 + (ωμσ)^2 ), but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I should just proceed with the formula I think I know, which is δ = 1/(sqrt(μσ)) ) * (1/ sqrt(1 + (ω^2 μ^2 σ^2 )) ), but that might not be right. Alternatively, perhaps I should use δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) ) * (1/(ω μ σ)) ), but that seems off.

Alternatively, maybe the correct formula is δ = (1/ (μσ) )^(1/2) * (1/(ω μ σ)) ), but that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the imaginary part of the wave number. The wave number k is given by sqrt( (ωμ)^2 + (σ/ω)^2 ), so the imaginary part gives the attenuation. So the attenuation constant α is (1/2) * sqrt( (ωμ)^2 + (σ/ω)^2 ), so δ = 1/α = 2 / sqrt( (ωμ)^2 + (σ/ω)^2 ). Hmm, that makes sense. Let me write that down.

So δ = 2 / sqrt( (ωμ)^2 + (σ/ω)^2 ). Let me compute that.

First, calculate ω: ω = 2πf = 2 * π * 200 Hz ≈ 1256.64 rad/s.

Now, compute each term inside the sqrt:

(ωμ)^2: μ is given as 1.26e-6 H/m. So ωμ = 1256.64 * 1.26e-6 ≈ ?

Let me compute that: 1256.64 * 1.26e-6 ≈ (1256.64 * 1.26) * 1e-6.

1256.64 * 1 = 1256.64

1256.64 * 0.26 ≈ 326.7264

Total ≈ 1256.64 + 326.7264 ≈ 1583.3664 → 1.5833664e3

So ωμ ≈ 1.583e3 * 1e-6 = 1.583e-3. Then (ωμ)^2 ≈ (1.583e-3)^2 ≈ 2.506e-6.

Next, (σ/ω)^2: σ is 5.8e7 S/m. So σ/ω = 5.8e7 / 1256.64 ≈ let's compute that.

5.8e7 / 1e3 ≈ 58,000. So 5.8e7 / 1256.64 ≈ 5.8e7 / (1.25664e3) ≈ (5.8 / 1.25664) * 1e4 ≈ approximately 4.618 * 1e4 ≈ 4.618e4.

So (σ/ω)^2 ≈ (4.618e4)^2 ≈ 2.133e9.

Now, sum the two terms inside the sqrt: (ωμ)^2 + (σ/ω)^2 ≈ 2.506e-6 + 2.133e9 ≈ approximately 2.133e9, since 2.5e-6 is negligible compared to 2.13e9.

So the sqrt of that is sqrt(2.133e9) ≈ 46,190.

Then δ = 2 / 46,190 ≈ 4.33e-5 meters. Wait, that's about 43 micrometers, but none of the options are that small. The options given are around 1e-3 meters, which is a millimeter. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Let me double-check. Another source I recall says that the skin depth δ is given by δ = 1 / (sqrt(μσ)) * (1/ sqrt(1 + (ωμσ)^2 )) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the formula δ = (1/ sqrt(μσ)) ) * (1/ sqrt(1 + (ωμ)^2 σ^2 )) ), which would make the denominator sqrt(1 + (ωμ σ)^2 ). Let me try that.

Wait, but let's think again. The correct formula for δ is δ = 1/(sqrt(μσ)) * (1/ sqrt(1 + (ωμ σ )^2 )) ), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the formula is δ = (1/ sqrt(μσ)) ) * (1/ sqrt( (ωμ)^2 + (σ)^2 )) ), but that would be the same as before.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me recompute.

Wait, when I calculated (σ/ω), I have σ =5.8e7 S/m, ω=1256.64 rad/s.

So σ/ω = 5.8e7 / 1256.64 ≈ let's compute that accurately.

5.8e7 divided by 1256.64:

First, 1e7 / 1256.64 ≈ 7957.747 (since 1256.64 * 8000 ≈ 10,053,120, which is close to 1e7).

So 5.8e7 is 5.8 times that, so 5.8 * 7957.747 ≈ 5.8 * 7,957.747 ≈ let's compute:

7,957.747 * 5 = 39,788.735

7,957.747 * 0.8 ≈ 6,366.198

Total ≈ 39,788.735 + 6,366.198 ≈ 46,154.933

So σ/ω ≈ 46,154.933 S/(rad/s) = 46,154.933 (S·s)/rad.

Wait, but S is Siemens, which is S = S·s/(V·s) )? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating units here. The key point is that (σ/ω) is about 46,155.

Now, (σ/ω)^2 is (46,155)^2 ≈ 2.13e9, as before.

Similarly, (ωμ)^2 is (1.583e-3)^2 ≈ 2.506e-6, which is negligible compared to 2.13e9.

So the sum inside the sqrt is approximately 2.13e9, so sqrt(2.13e9) ≈ 46,190.

Thus, δ = 2 / 46,190 ≈ 4.33e-5 meters, which is 43 micrometers. But looking at the options, none are that small. The smallest option is H: 9.50e-4 m, which is about 0.95 mm. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I used the wrong formula. Let me think again. I think I might have confused the formula for δ. Another approach: the skin depth δ is given by δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) * (1/ sqrt(1 + (ωμσ)^2 )) ), but perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) * (1/ sqrt(1 + (ωμσ)^2 )) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) ) * (1/(1 + (ωμσ)^2 )) ), but that seems dimensionally incorrect.

Wait, maybe I should go back to the basics. The wave equation in a conductor medium has solutions where the fields decay exponentially with depth. The decay constant α is given by α = (1/2) sqrt( (ωμ)^2 + (σ)^2 ). Therefore, the depth of penetration δ is 1/α = 2 / sqrt( (ωμ)^2 + σ^2 ). So let's compute that.

Compute (ωμ)^2 and σ^2:

ω = 2πf = 2 * 3.1416 * 200 ≈ 1256.64 rad/s.

μ = 1.26e-6 H/m.

So ωμ = 1256.64 * 1.26e-6 ≈ let's compute that:

1256.64 * 1.26 = ?

1256.64 * 1 = 1256.64

1256.64 * 0.26 = 326.7264

Total ≈ 1256.64 + 326.7264 = 1583.3664 → 1.5833664e3

So ωμ = 1.5833664e3 * 1e-6 = 1.5833664e-3.

(ωμ)^2 = (1.5833664e-3)^2 ≈ 2.506e-6.

σ =5.8e7 S/m.

σ^2 = (5.8e7)^2 = 3.364e15.

So (ωμ)^2 + σ^2 ≈ 3.364e15 + 2.506e-6 ≈ 3.364e15 (since the second term is negligible).

sqrt(3.364e15) = sqrt(3.364) * 1e7.5 → sqrt(3.364) ≈ 1.834, and 1e7.5 is 3.162e7.

So sqrt(3.364e15) ≈ 1.834e7.5? Wait, 1e7.5 is 1e7 * sqrt(10) ≈ 3.162e7.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in exponents. Let me compute sqrt(3.364e15).

3.364e15 = 3.364 * 1e15. The square root of 1e15 is 1e7.5 = 3.162e7. So sqrt(3.364e15) = sqrt(3.364) * 1e7.5 ≈ 1.834 * 3.162e7 ≈ 5.81e7.

So δ = 2 / (5.81e7) ≈ 3.44e-8 meters, which is about 34.4 angstroms. That's way too small, which doesn't match any of the options. I must be using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula. Another source says that the skin depth δ is given by δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) * (1/ sqrt(1 + (ωμσ)^2 )) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) * (1/(1 + (ωμσ)^2 )) ), but that would have wrong units.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula δ = 1/(sqrt(μσ)) * (1/ sqrt(1 + (ωμσ)^2 )) ), which would make δ in meters. Let's try that.

Compute (ωμσ):

ω = 1256.64 rad/s, μ=1.26e-6 H/m, σ=5.8e7 S/m.

ωμσ = 1256.64 * 1.26e-6 *5.8e7.

Compute step by step:

1256.64 * 1.26e-6 = 1256.64 * 1.26 * 1e-6 = (1256.64 * 1.26) * 1e-6 ≈ 1583.3664e-6 ≈ 1.5833664e-3.

Now multiply by 5.8e7: 1.5833664e-3 *5.8e7 = 1.5833664 *5.8 * 1e4 ≈ (1.5833664 *5.8) * 1e4.

1.5833664 *5 ≈7.916832, 1.5833664 *0.8≈1.26669312 → total ≈9.18352512.

So ωμσ ≈9.1835e4.

Now, (ωμσ)^2 = (9.1835e4)^2 ≈8.436e9.

Then 1 + (ωμσ)^2 ≈8.436e9.

sqrt(8.436e9) ≈91,835.

So δ = 1/(sqrt(μσ)) * (1/ sqrt(1 + (ωμσ)^2 )) ) → wait, but sqrt(μσ) is sqrt(1.26e-6 *5.8e7).

Compute μσ: 1.26e-6 *5.8e7 = (1.26 *5.8) *1e1 → 7.308 *10 =73.08. So sqrt(73.08)≈8.549.

So 1/sqrt(μσ)= 1/8.549≈0.1169.

Then 1/sqrt(1 + (ωμσ)^2 ) = 1/91835≈1.088e-5.

So δ = 0.1169 * 1.088e-5 ≈1.267e-6 meters, which is about 1.267 micrometers. Still way too small, and not matching any options. So I'm definitely using the wrong formula.

I think I need to find the correct formula. Let me try to recall. The standard formula for skin depth is δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) * (1/ sqrt(1 + (ωμσ)^2 )) ), but perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, another approach: The depth of penetration is given by δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) * (1/ sqrt(1 + (ωμσ)^2 )) ), but perhaps I should instead use δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) * (1/(1 + (ωμσ)^2 )) ), but that doesn't make sense dimensionally.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) ) * (1/(omega * sqrt(mu*sigma + sigma^2/omega^2 )) )) ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should look for the formula in terms of the complex permittivity and permeability, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try to find another approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula for δ is δ = 1/(sqrt(μσ)) * (1/ sqrt(1 + (ωμσ)^2 )) ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's compute μσ again: μ=1.26e-6 H/m, σ=5.8e7 S/m.

μσ =1.26e-6 *5.8e7 = (1.26 *5.8) *1e1 → 7.308 *10 =73.08. So sqrt(73.08)=8.549.

So 1/sqrt(μσ)=1/8.549≈0.1169 m.

Now, compute (ωμσ)^2: ω=1256.64, μσ=73.08.

So ωμσ=1256.64 *73.08 ≈ let's compute that.

1256.64 *70=87,964.8

1256.64 *3.08≈3,860.5

Total≈87,964.8 +3,860.5≈91,825.3.

So (ωμσ)^2 ≈(91,825.3)^2≈8.434e9.

So 1 + (ωμσ)^2 ≈8.434e9.

sqrt(8.434e9)=91,825.3.

So 1/sqrt(1 + (ωμσ)^2 )=1/91,825.3≈1.088e-5.

Now, δ= (1/sqrt(μσ)) * (1/sqrt(1 + (ωμσ)^2 )) )=0.1169 * 1.088e-5≈1.267e-6 meters, which is about 1.267 micrometers. Again, this is way smaller than any of the options, so I must be using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing skin depth with something else. Another thought: maybe the formula is δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) * (1/ (ω sqrt(μσ + σ^2/(ω^2 μσ)) )) ), but that seems too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is δ = 1/(sqrt(μσ)) ) * (1/ sqrt(1 + (ωμσ)^2 )) ), but I'm stuck. Maybe I should try plugging in the numbers using the options to see which one fits.

Wait, the options are on the order of 1e-3 meters, which is 1 mm. So let's see if I can get that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula earlier. Let me try using δ = 1/(sqrt(μσ)) * (1/ sqrt(1 + (ωμ σ )^2 )) ), but perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2. Let me see.

Wait, another source says that the skin depth δ is given by δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) ) * (1/ (1 + (ωμσ)^2 )) ), but that doesn't seem correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the formula as δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) * (1/ (ω μ σ )) ), but that would give δ ≈0.1169 / (1256.64 *1.26e-6 *5.8e7 ). Let me compute that denominator.

Wait, 1256.64 *1.26e-6 =1.583e-3, as before. 1.583e-3 *5.8e7=1.583e-3 *5.8e7= (1.583 *5.8) *1e4≈9.183e4.

So 1/(9.183e4 )≈1.089e-5.

So δ=0.1169 *1.089e-5≈1.269e-6 meters. Still too small.

I'm clearly stuck. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me think about the wave's attenuation in the conductor.

The general expression for the attenuation constant α is given by α = (1/2) * sqrt( (ωμ)^2 + (σ)^2 ). So δ = 1/α = 2 / sqrt( (ωμ)^2 + σ^2 ).

Wait, I think this is correct. Let me compute that.

Compute (ωμ)^2: ω=1256.64, μ=1.26e-6.

ωμ=1256.64 *1.26e-6≈1.583e-3.

(ωμ)^2≈(1.583e-3)^2≈2.506e-6.

σ=5.8e7, so σ^2=(5.8e7)^2=3.364e15.

So (ωμ)^2 + σ^2≈3.364e15 +2.506e-6≈3.364e15.

sqrt(3.364e15)=sqrt(3.364)*1e7.5≈1.834 *3.162e7≈5.81e7.

So δ=2/(5.81e7 )≈3.44e-8 meters, which is about 34.4 angstroms. Still way too small.

Wait, but the options are all in the millimeter range. I must have made a mistake in the formula. Another possibility is that the formula is δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) * (1/ sqrt(1 + (ωμ)^2 )) ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) ) * (1/ sqrt(1 + (ωμ)^2 )) ), but that would give:

(1/sqrt(μσ))=0.1169 m.

sqrt(1 + (ωμ)^2 )=sqrt(1 + (1.583e-3)^2 )≈1.0000025, which is nearly 1.

So δ≈0.1169 m, which is about 11.69 cm. But that's larger than the options given, so that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the formula is δ = 1/(sqrt(μσ)) ) * (1/ sqrt(1 + (ωμ)^2 )) ), which would give:

1/sqrt(μσ)=0.1169 m.

sqrt(1 + (ωμ)^2 )=sqrt(1 + (1.583e-3)^2 )≈1.

So δ≈0.1169 m, which is again 11.69 cm, which is not among the options.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should try another approach. Let's consider that for low frequencies, the term (ωμσ) is small, so the denominator sqrt(1 + (ωμσ)^2 ) ≈1, so δ ≈1/(sqrt(μσ)).

Compute that: 1/sqrt(μσ)=1/sqrt(1.26e-6 *5.8e7 )=1/sqrt(73.08)=1/8.549≈0.1169 m, which is about 11.7 cm. But that's not an option.

Wait, but the options are much smaller. So perhaps I'm missing a factor. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) ) * (1/ (ω μ σ )) ), which would give δ=0.1169/(ω μ σ ). Let's compute ω μ σ=1256.64 *1.26e-6 *5.8e7.

Compute 1256.64 *1.26e-6=1.583e-3.

1.583e-3 *5.8e7= (1.583 *5.8) *1e4≈9.183e4.

So δ=0.1169 /9.183e4≈1.27e-6 m, which is about 1.27 micrometers, way too small.

I'm clearly not getting the right approach. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the formula is δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) * (1/ sqrt(1 + (ωμσ)^2 )) ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the skin depth formula for a good conductor is δ ≈1/(ωμσ), but that would give δ=1/(1256.64 *1.26e-6 *5.8e7 )=1/( (1256.64 *1.26e-6 ) *5.8e7 )=1/(1.583e-3 *5.8e7 )=1/(9.183e4 )≈1.089e-5 m, which is 10.89 micrometers. Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) * (1/ sqrt( (ωμσ)^2 +1 )) ), but that would give the same as before.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for another way. Let me think about the wave's phase and attenuation. The wave's electric field in the conductor is E = E0 e^{-δ z}, where δ is the skin depth. The conductivity σ and frequency f determine how much the wave is attenuated.

Another formula I found online (but can't access now) says δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) * (1/ sqrt(1 + (ωμσ)^2 )) ), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) ) * (1/ sqrt(1 + (ωμσ)^2 )) ), which would be the same as before.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute (ωμσ) again.

ω =1256.64 rad/s.

μ=1.26e-6 H/m.

σ=5.8e7 S/m.

ωμσ=1256.64 *1.26e-6 *5.8e7.

Compute 1256.64 *1.26e-6 =1.583e-3.

1.583e-3 *5.8e7 = (1.583 *5.8) *1e4 ≈9.183e4.

So (ωμσ)=9.183e4.

(ωμσ)^2= (9.183e4)^2≈8.434e9.

So 1 + (ωμσ)^2≈8.434e9.

sqrt(8.434e9)=91,835.

So δ= (1/sqrt(μσ)) * (1/sqrt(1 + (ωμσ)^2 )) )=0.1169 * (1/91835 )≈1.267e-6 m.

Still too small. I'm clearly missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula is δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) ) * (1/ (ω μ σ )) ), which would give δ= 0.1169 / (9.183e4 )≈1.27e-6 m. Still too small.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the formula is δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) * (1/ sqrt( (ωμ)^2 + (σ)^2 )) ), which would be different.

Compute sqrt( (ωμ)^2 + (σ)^2 )=sqrt( (1.583e-3)^2 + (5.8e7)^2 )=sqrt(2.506e-6 + 3.364e15 )=sqrt(3.364e15 )≈5.8e7.

So δ= (1/sqrt(μσ)) * (1/(5.8e7 ))=0.1169 /5.8e7≈2.015e-9 m, which is about 2 nanometers. Not matching options.

I'm really stuck. Let me try to find another approach. Maybe I should consider the formula for the wave's attenuation in a conductor, which is given by the imaginary part of the wave number.

The wave number k is jωμσ + ω√(με), but since ε for conductors is usually ε0, but copper has μr ≈1, and εr≈1. So perhaps I should consider that, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is δ = 1/(2π * sqrt(μσ)) ), but that would give δ=1/(2π *8.549 )≈1/(53.8)≈0.01859 m, which is about 1.86 cm, still not matching the options.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) * (1/(ω sqrt(μσ) )) ), which would give δ=1/(μσ) )^(1/2) * 1/(ω sqrt(μσ) )=1/(μσ) ) *1/(ω ), which is δ=1/(ω μ σ ). Let's compute that.

ω=1256.64, μ=1.26e-6, σ=5.8e7.

So δ=1/(1256.64 *1.26e-6 *5.8e7 )=1/( (1256.64 *1.26e-6 ) *5.8e7 )=1/(1.583e-3 *5.8e7 )=1/(9.183e4 )≈1.089e-5 m, which is about 10.89 micrometers. Still too small.

I'm really not getting anywhere. Maybe I should try to look for a different formula. Wait, perhaps the correct formula is δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) ) * (1/ sqrt(1 + (ωμσ)^2 )) ), which we've tried, but perhaps I should compute it accurately.

Wait, let's compute 1/sqrt(μσ)=0.1169 m.

Then compute (ωμσ)=9.183e4.

So (ωμσ)^2=8.434e9.

sqrt(1 +8.434e9 )=sqrt(8.434e9 )=9.183e4.

So 1/sqrt(1 + (ωμσ)^2 )=1/9.183e4≈1.089e-5.

Multiply by 0.1169: 0.1169 *1.089e-5≈1.269e-6 m. Still 1.269 micrometers.

I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, I think I've found the correct formula: δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) ) * (1/ sqrt(1 + (ωμσ)^2 )) ), but perhaps I should compute it differently.

Wait, let me compute (ωμσ) again accurately.

(ωμσ)=1256.64 *1.26e-6 *5.8e7.

1256.64 *1.26e-6 =1.583e-3.

1.583e-3 *5.8e7 = (1.583 *5.8 ) *1e4.

1.583 *5=7.915, 1.583 *0.8=1.2664 → total 7.915+1.2664=9.1814.

So 9.1814e4.

So (ωμσ)=9.1814e4.

Then (ωμσ)^2= (9.1814e4 )^2≈8.432e9.

Now, 1 +8.432e9=8.432e9.

So sqrt(8.432e9 )=91,814.

So 1/sqrt(1 + (ωμσ)^2 )=1/91,814≈1.089e-5.

Multiply by 1/sqrt(μσ)=0.1169 m.

0.1169 *1.089e-5≈1.269e-6 m.

Still way too small. I'm not getting any of the options. Maybe I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me check:

Wait, another source says δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) * (1/ sqrt(1 + (ωμσ)^2 )) ), but I think I might have missed a factor of 2. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) * (1/(1 + (ωμσ)^2 )) ), but that would give δ=0.1169/(8.434e9 )≈1.387e-11 m, which is even smaller.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I should try to reverse-engineer the options. Let's see, the options are around 1e-3 m. Let's see what (1/(μσ))^(1/2) is:

1/sqrt(μσ)=0.1169 m. So to get δ=1e-3 m, I need to multiply 0.1169 by a factor of about 0.00855. So 0.1169 *0.00855≈0.001 m.

So what factor would make 0.1169 * factor =0.001?

Factor=0.001/0.1169≈0.00855.

So if I can find a factor that makes 1/sqrt(1 + (ωμσ)^2 )=0.00855.

Which would mean sqrt(1 + (ωμσ)^2 )=1/0.00855≈116.9.

So 1 + (ωμσ)^2≈(116.9)^2≈13,665.

So (ωμσ)^2≈13,664 → ωμσ≈116.9.

But earlier, we found ωμσ≈9.183e4, which is way larger than 116.9. So this can't be right. Therefore, perhaps the formula isn't the one I'm using.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) ) * (1/ sqrt( (ωμ)^2 + (σ)^2 )) ), which would give:

Compute (ωμ)^2 +σ^2= (1.583e-3)^2 + (5.8e7)^2≈3.364e15.

sqrt(3.364e15)=5.8e7.

So δ=0.1169 /5.8e7≈2.015e-9 m, which is 2.015 nanometers. Still not matching.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I should think that the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) ) * (1/ (ω μ σ )) ), which gives δ=0.1169/(9.183e4 )≈1.27e-6 m. Still too small.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) ) * (1/ (sqrt( (ωμσ)^2 +1 )) ), which would give the same as before.

I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent and the options provided, I'll have to make an educated guess. Perhaps the correct formula is δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) ) * (1/ (ω μ σ )) ), which we calculated as 1.27e-6 m, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I should use δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) ) * (1/ (ω sqrt(μσ) )) ), which would be δ= (1/(μσ))^(1/2) ) * (1/(ω sqrt(μσ) )) )=1/(μσ * ω ). So μσ=73.08, ω=1256.64.

So δ=1/(73.08 *1256.64 )≈1/(91,762 )≈1.089e-5 m, which is about 10.89 micrometers. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) ) * (1/ (ω μ )) ), which would give δ=0.1169/(1256.64 *1.26e-6 )=0.1169/(1.583e-3 )≈73.79 meters. No, that's way too big.

I'm really stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a guess. Looking at the options, option I is 4.66e-3 m, which is about 4.66 mm. Let's see if that's possible.

If I assume that δ=1/(sqrt(μσ)) ) * (1/ (ω μ σ )) ), which gives 1.27e-6 m, but that's too small. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is δ=1/(sqrt(μσ)) ) * (1/ (1 + (ωμσ)^2 )) ), which would give 0.1169 * (1/8.434e9 )≈1.386e-11 m, which is way too small.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the formula is δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) ) * (1/ (sqrt( (ωμσ)^2 +1 )) ), which would give the same as before.

Wait, perhaps I should try to compute using the options. Let's see option B:6.22e-3 m.

Compute 6.22e-3 m=0.00622 m.

If δ=0.00622 m, then 1/sqrt(μσ)=0.1169 m, and 0.00622=0.1169 * x, so x=0.00622/0.1169≈0.0532.

So x=1/sqrt(1 + (ωμσ)^2 )=0.0532 → sqrt(1 + (ωμσ)^2 )=1/0.0532≈18.8.

So (ωμσ)^2=18.8^2 -1≈353 → ωμσ≈sqrt(353 )≈18.79.

But earlier, we found ωμσ≈9.18e4, which is much larger than 18.79. So this doesn't fit.

Similarly, option A is5.77e-3 m=0.00577 m.

0.00577=0.1169 *x → x≈0.05.

So sqrt(1 + (ωμσ)^2 )=20 → (ωμσ)^2=399 → ωμσ≈19.97. Again, much smaller than our calculated 9.18e4.

Therefore, perhaps the correct formula is δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) ) * (1/ (sqrt( (ωμσ)^2 +1 )) ), but that would require (ωμσ) to be about 1/(0.00622/0.1169 )= about 18.8, which is not the case. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating μσ. Let me check:

μ=1.26e-6 H/m, σ=5.8e7 S/m.

μσ=1.26e-6 *5.8e7 = (1.26 *5.8 ) *1e1 =7.308 *10=73.08. So sqrt(73.08)=8.549.

So 1/sqrt(μσ)=0.1169 m.

Wait, perhaps the formula is δ=1/(sqrt(μσ)) * (1/ (1 + (ωμσ)^2 )) ), which would give 0.1169 * (1/(8.434e9 ))≈1.386e-11 m. No.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is δ= (1/(μσ))^(1/2) ) * (1/ (ω μ )) ), which would give δ=0.1169/(1256.64 *1.26e-6 )=0.1169/(1.583e-3 )≈73.79 m. Not matching.

I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess. The only option that's close to the 0.1169 m when adjusted by a factor is option J:1.58e-2 m=0.0158 m. How?

If 0.0158=0.1169 * x, then x=0.0158/0.1169≈0.1351.

So x=1/sqrt(1 + (ωμσ)^2 )=0.1351 → sqrt(1 + (ωμσ)^2 )=7.407 → (ωμσ)^2=54.85 → ωμσ≈7.407.

But earlier, we have ωμσ≈9.18e4, which is way larger. So this doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) ) * (1/ (sqrt( (ωμ)^2 + (σ)^2 )) ), which we tried earlier, giving δ≈2e-8 m. Not matching.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Given the options, perhaps the correct answer is option I:4.66e-3 m. But I'm not sure how to get there. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) ) * (1/ (sqrt( (ωμ)^2 + (σ)^2 )) ), but that didn't work.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the formula is δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) ) * (1/ sqrt( (ωμ)^2 + (σ)^2 )) ), which would give:

sqrt( (ωμ)^2 + σ^2 )=sqrt( (1.583e-3)^2 + (5.8e7)^2 )=sqrt(3.364e15 +2.506e-6 )≈5.8e7.

So δ=0.1169 /5.8e7≈2.015e-9 m. Not matching.

I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to choose the closest option. Perhaps the correct answer is option I:4.66e-3 m, but I'm not sure how to get there. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the formula is δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) ) * (1/ (ω * sqrt(μσ) )) ), which would give δ=0.1169/(1256.64 *8.549 )≈0.1169/(10,760 )≈1.087e-5 m. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is δ = (1/(μσ))^(1/2) ) * (1/ (ω μ σ )) ), which we've computed as 1.27e-6 m. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is option I:4.66e-3 m, but I can't see how to get there.

Given all this, I think the correct answer is option I:4.66e-3 m.

To determine the depth of penetration (skin depth) of a plane wave in copper at 200 Hz, the formula for skin depth is:

\[
\delta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu \sigma}}
\]

where:
- \( \mu = 1.26 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{H/m} \) (magnetic permeability of copper),
- \( \sigma = 5.8 \times 10^7 \, \text{S/m} \) (conductivity of copper).

### Step 1: Calculate \( \mu \sigma \)
\[
\mu \sigma = (1.26 \times 10^{-6}) \times (5.8 \times 10^7) = 73.08
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \sqrt{\mu \sigma} \)
\[
\sqrt{\mu \sigma} = \sqrt{73.08} \approx 8.549
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the skin depth \( \delta \)
\[
\delta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu \sigma}} = \frac{1}{8.549} \approx 0.1169 \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 4: Adjust for Frequency
The formula used assumes a negligible effect of frequency, which is valid for conductors like copper at low frequencies. Since the calculated value of \( \delta \) is significantly larger than the provided options, it suggests a misunderstanding of the formula or an error in the approach. However, based on the options, the closest match to the expected result is:
