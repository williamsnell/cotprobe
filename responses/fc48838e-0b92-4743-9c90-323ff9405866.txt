Okay, so I have this problem here about the average salary increase at Bedford Manufacturing Co. over a 10-year period. The question is asking for two things: (a) the average weekly salary at the beginning and (b) at the end of the period. The options are given from A to J, each with two numbers representing the start and end salaries.

Let me start by understanding the problem. The average salary rose by 60% over 10 years, and this increase amounted to $42.50 per week. So, the increase of 60% equals $42.50. I need to find the original salary and the final salary.

Hmm, okay. Let's think about percentages. If the salary increased by 60%, that means the final salary is 160% of the original salary. But wait, the increase itself is 60% of the original, so the increase is $42.50. So, mathematically, 60% of the original salary equals $42.50.

Let me write that down. Let’s denote the original salary as S. So, 60% of S is $42.50. In equation form, that's 0.6 * S = 42.50. To find S, I can divide both sides by 0.6. So, S = 42.50 / 0.6.

Let me calculate that. 42.50 divided by 0.6. Well, 0.6 is the same as 3/5, so dividing by 0.6 is the same as multiplying by 5/3. So, 42.50 * (5/3) = ?

Wait, let's do it step by step. 42.50 divided by 0.6. 42.50 ÷ 0.6. Let me compute that. 42.50 ÷ 0.6 equals approximately 70.8333... So, the original salary S is about $70.83.

Now, the final salary is the original plus the increase, which is 60% of S. Alternatively, since the final salary is 160% of S, I can calculate that as well. Let me compute 160% of 70.83.

So, 160% is 1.6 times S. 1.6 * 70.83. Let me calculate that. 70.83 * 1.6. Let's break it down: 70 * 1.6 = 112, and 0.83 * 1.6 = approximately 1.328. Adding them together gives 112 + 1.328 = 113.328, which is roughly $113.33.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check. Option F is $70.83 and $113.33. That seems to match what I calculated. So part (a) is $70.83 and part (b) is $113.33.

Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The increase is 60%, so 0.6 * S = 42.50, so S = 42.50 / 0.6 = 70.8333... which rounds to $70.83. Then, the final salary is S + 42.50, which is 70.83 + 42.50 = 113.33. Alternatively, 70.83 * 1.6 is 113.328, which also rounds to 113.33. So yes, that makes sense.

Looking at the options, F is the one with 70.83 and 113.33. So I think that's the correct answer.

The original salary is calculated by dividing the increase by 0.6, resulting in $70.83. The final salary is 160% of the original, which is $113.33. 

Answer: F
