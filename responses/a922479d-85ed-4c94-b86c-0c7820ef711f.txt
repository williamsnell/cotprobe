Okay, so I need to compute 52 plus 6 times 2. Hmm, let me think about the order of operations here. Oh right, multiplication comes before addition. So first, I should calculate 6 multiplied by 2. 

6 times 2 is 12. Got that down. Now, I add that result to 52. So 52 plus 12. Let me do that addition. 52 plus 10 is 62, and then plus 2 more makes 64. Wait, but looking at the options, J is 64. But wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check the steps. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the order. The problem is 52 + 6 * 2. So yes, multiplication first, 6*2=12, then 52+12=64. So the answer should be J:64.

The correct computation follows the order of operations: multiplication before addition. 6 * 2 = 12, then 52 + 12 = 64. 

Answer: J
