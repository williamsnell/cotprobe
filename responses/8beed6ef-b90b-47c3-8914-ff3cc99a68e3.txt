Okay, so I have this question about the Cauchy density function. Hmm, I remember from my probability class that the Cauchy distribution is a continuous probability distribution. The function given is f(x) = K / (1 + x²) for all real numbers x. I need to find K, the expected value E(X), and the variance of X.

Starting with part (a), finding K. I know that for a function to be a probability density function (pdf), the integral of f(x) over all x must equal 1. So I need to compute the integral of K/(1 + x²) dx from -∞ to ∞ and set it equal to 1.

Wait, what's the integral of 1/(1 + x²) dx? Oh right, that's the standard integral. The integral from -∞ to ∞ of 1/(1 + x²) dx is π. Because the integral of 1/(1 + x²) from 0 to ∞ is π/2, so doubling that gives π. So the integral becomes K * π. Setting that equal to 1, K must be 1/π. So K is 1/π. That narrows down the options. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, A has K=1/π, D same, E same, H has K=π, I has K=1/π, J has K=π/2. So options A, D, E, I have K=1/π or similar. So part (a) K=1/π.

Next, part (b), expected value E(X). The expected value is the integral of x*f(x) dx from -∞ to ∞. So f(x) is K/(1 + x²), so E(X) = ∫x * [K/(1+x²)] dx from -∞ to ∞.

Wait, but x is an odd function, and 1/(1+x²) is even. The product x * [1/(1+x²)] is an odd function. The integral of an odd function over symmetric limits (-∞ to ∞) is zero. So E(X) should be zero. So that's part (b).

So now for part (c), the variance of X. Variance is E(X²) - [E(X)]². Since E(X) is zero, variance is just E(X²).

E(X²) is ∫x² * f(x) dx from -∞ to ∞. So f(x) is K/(1 + x²), so E(X²) = ∫x² * [K/(1 + x²)] dx from -∞ to ∞.

Hmm, how to compute this integral. Let's think. Maybe substitution. Let me make substitution t = x, so dt = dx. Not helpful. Maybe use substitution x = tanθ, but wait, 1 + x² = sec²θ. So x = tanθ, dx = sec²θ dθ. Then when x approaches -∞, θ approaches -π/2, and when x approaches ∞, θ approaches π/2. So the limits become from -π/2 to π/2.

Substituting, E(X²) becomes ∫(tan²θ) * [K/(1 + tan²θ)] * sec²θ dθ. But 1 + tan²θ = sec²θ, so that denominator becomes sec²θ. So the expression simplifies to ∫ tan²θ * [K / sec²θ] * sec²θ dθ. The sec²θ cancels out. So we're left with K ∫ tan²θ dθ from -π/2 to π/2.

Hmm, ∫ tan²θ dθ. I remember that tan²θ = sec²θ - 1. So substitution gives ∫ (sec²θ - 1) dθ. The integral of sec²θ is tanθ, and the integral of 1 is θ. So evaluating from -π/2 to π/2.

Wait, let's compute the integral:

K ∫ (sec²θ - 1) dθ from -π/2 to π/2.

So the integral becomes:

K [ tanθ - θ ] evaluated from -π/2 to π/2.

Wait, but tan(π/2) is undefined, it goes to infinity. Similarly, tan(-π/2) is negative infinity. Hmm, so this approach leads to a problem because the integral might diverge. Wait, that can't be right because the Cauchy distribution has a finite variance? Or does it?

Wait, no, I think the Cauchy distribution actually has an undefined variance because the integral for E(X²) doesn't converge. Let me think again. Because when I compute E(X²), the integral becomes ∫ x²/(1 + x²) dx from -∞ to ∞. That's the same as ∫ [1 - 1/(1 + x²)] dx, which is ∫ 1 dx - ∫ 1/(1 + x²) dx.

Wait, ∫1 dx from -∞ to ∞ is infinite. So E(X²) would be infinite minus π*K. Since K=1/π, it's infinite minus 1, which is still infinite. So the variance is infinite because E(X²) is infinite. So the variance is ∞.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me double-check. The Cauchy distribution doesn't have a finite mean or variance because the tails are too heavy. So E(X) is 0, but E(X²) is infinite, so variance is infinite.

So putting it all together: K=1/π, E(X)=0, Var(X)=∞.

Looking at the options, option E says K=1/π, E(X)=0, Var=∞. So option E is the correct one.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option E is K=1/π, E(X)=0, Variance=∞. That matches.

So the answer should be E.

The Cauchy density function is given by \( f(x) = \frac{K}{1 + x^2} \) for all real numbers \( x \). 

(a) To determine \( K \), we ensure that the integral of \( f(x) \) over all \( x \) equals 1. The integral of \( \frac{1}{1 + x^2} \) from \( -\infty \) to \( \infty \) is \( \pi \). Thus, \( K \cdot \pi = 1 \), so \( K = \frac{1}{\pi} \).

(b) The expected value \( E(X) \) is the integral of \( x \cdot f(x) \) over all \( x \). Since \( x \) is an odd function and \( \frac{1}{1 + x^2} \) is even, their product is odd. The integral of an odd function over symmetric limits is zero, so \( E(X) = 0 \).

(c) The variance of \( X \) is \( E(X^2) - [E(X)]^2 \). Since \( E(X) = 0 \), the variance is \( E(X^2) \). The integral for \( E(X^2) \) is \( \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{x^2}{1 + x^2} \, dx \), which diverges because the integrand approaches 1 as \( x \to \pm\infty \). Thus, the variance is infinite.

The correct option is E: \( K = \frac{1}{\pi} \), \( E(X) = 0 \), and Variance of \( X = \infty \).
