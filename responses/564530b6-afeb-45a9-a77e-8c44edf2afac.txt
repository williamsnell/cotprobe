Okay, so I've got this problem about mixing ice and water, and I need to figure out how much ice remains when the temperature drops to 0°C. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem states that we have 500 grams of ice at 0°C added to 500 grams of water at 64°C. The heat of fusion for water is given as 80 cal/g. I remember that heat of fusion is the amount of energy needed to melt ice into water at 0°C.

First, I think the ice will absorb heat from the warmer water. The warmer water will lose heat as it cools down, and the ice will either absorb that heat to melt or the system will reach equilibrium at 0°C. Since the final temperature is 0°C, that suggests that all the ice might not have melted, and some water from the warm side might have frozen. Or maybe not. Wait, no, because the ice is at 0 and the water is above, so the ice will absorb heat from the water, possibly melting some of it until the water cools down to 0. But since the final temperature is 0, maybe some of the ice remains.

Wait, no, wait. The ice is at 0°C, so it can't absorb heat to change its temperature further. The water is at 64, so it will cool down, releasing heat. The heat released by the water will be used to melt the ice. But we have to see if all the ice can be melted by that heat, or if some heat remains to cool the water to 0.

Wait, no, the final temperature is 0°C, so the water will release heat as it cools from 64 to 0, and that heat will go into melting the ice. If the heat released by the water cooling is enough to melt all the ice, then we'll have all water. But if not, some ice will remain.

Let me calculate the heat released by the water when it cools down to 0°C. The formula is Q = m * c * ΔT, where c is the specific heat capacity of water, which I think is 1 cal/(g°C). So m=500g, ΔT=64°C.

So Q_water = 500g * 1 cal/g°C * (64°C - 0°C) = 500 * 64 = 32,000 calories.

Now, the heat absorbed by the ice is used to melt it. The heat of fusion is 80 cal/g, so the heat needed to melt x grams of ice is Q_ice = x * 80.

Since all the heat from the water goes into melting the ice, we can set Q_water = Q_ice.

So 32,000 cal = x * 80 cal/g → x = 32,000 / 80 = 400 grams.

Wait, that's interesting. So 400 grams of ice would be melted by the heat released. But we have 500 grams of ice initially. So if 400 grams melt, the remaining ice would be 500 - 400 = 100 grams. So the answer would be 100 grams, which is option H.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. The water is cooling from 64 to 0, releasing 32,000 calories. Each gram of ice requires 80 calories to melt. So 32,000 /80=400 grams of ice can be melted. So 400 grams of ice melt, leaving 100 grams of ice. So yes, the remaining ice is 100 grams, which is option H.

But wait—another thought: the water after cooling to 0°C might have some remaining energy? No, because all the heat released by the water goes into melting the ice. So the water ends up at 0°C, and the ice that remains is 100 grams.

Alternatively, could the water cool the ice down? No, the ice is already at 0, so no change in temperature for the ice, just phase change.

So yeah, I think the correct answer is H: 100 grams.

The problem involves mixing 500 g of ice at 0°C with 500 g of water at 64°C. The heat released by the water as it cools to 0°C is calculated using the formula \( Q = m \cdot c \cdot \Delta T \), where \( c = 1 \, \text{cal/g°C} \). This gives \( Q_{\text{water}} = 500 \cdot 1 \cdot 64 = 32,000 \, \text{cal} \). This heat is used to melt the ice, with the heat of fusion being \( 80 \, \text{cal/g} \). The amount of ice that can be melted is \( \frac{32,000}{80} = 400 \, \text{g} \). Since 400 g of ice melts, the remaining ice is \( 500 - 400 = 100 \, \text{g} \). Thus, the weight of ice still present is **100 g**, corresponding to option H.

Answer: H
