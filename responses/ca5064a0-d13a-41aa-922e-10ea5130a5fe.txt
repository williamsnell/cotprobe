Okay, so I've got this problem about Fraunhofer diffraction, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by recalling what I know about this. Fraunhofer diffraction occurs when light passes through a single slit and creates a pattern on a screen. The central bright band is the central maximum, and the angular breadth refers to the angle between the first minima on either side of this central maximum.

The formula I remember for the angular width is related to the wavelength of the light and the width of the slit. The first minima occur when the path difference is equal to λ/2. The formula for the angle θ is given by sinθ = λ/(2d), where d is the width of the slit.

Wait, actually, let me make sure. The condition for the first minimum in single-slit diffraction is indeed a*(sinθ) = λ/2, where a is the slit width. But wait, wait, sometimes I get confused between a and d. Oh right, in the formula, it's a*(sinθ) = mλ. For the first minimum, m=1, so a sinθ = λ. So, the first minimum is at θ where sinθ=λ/a.

Wait, no! Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Oh wait, no, the formula is a sinθ = mλ, right? So for the first minimum, m=1, so sinθ = λ/a.

Wait, but wait, the slit width is d, so maybe the formula is d sinθ = mλ. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. In single-slit diffraction, the positions of the minima are given by d sinθ = mλ, where d is the slit width, m is the order (1,2,3...), and λ is the wavelength.

So the central maximum is between the first minima on either side. The angular width of the central maximum is the angle between these two first minima. Since the angle is small (assuming θ is small, which it is for visible light and typical slit widths), we can approximate sinθ ≈ tanθ ≈ θ in radians.

So for each part a) and b), I need to calculate θ for m=1, and then multiply by 2 to get the total angular breadth.

Wait, no. Wait, the question is asking for the half-angular breadth, which is the angle from the center to one of the first minima. So for each case, I calculate θ for m=1, and that's the half-angle. So the total angular breadth would be twice that, but the question asks for the half, so I just find θ for m=1.

Wait, the problem says "half-angular breadth", so that's just θ, not 2θ. So I just need to compute θ for m=1, which is θ = arcsin(λ/(d)).

Wait, no, because d sinθ = λ, so sinθ = λ/d. So θ is arcsin(λ/d).

But wait, when the angle is small, we can approximate sinθ ≈ θ in radians. So θ ≈ λ/(d), but since the given options are in degrees, I'll have to convert from radians.

Wait, but I should probably just calculate it using the exact formula and then convert to degrees.

So the slit width is given as 14 ×10^-5 cm. Let me convert that to meters because the wavelength is given in micrometers. 1 cm is 0.01 meters, so 14e-5 cm is 14e-5 * 1e-2 m = 14e-7 m.

Alternatively, 14 ×10^-5 cm = 14 ×1e-6 m = 14e-6 m = 1.4e-5 m? Wait, let me double-check: 1 cm is 0.01 m. So 14e-5 cm is 14e-5 * 0.01 = 14e-7 m, which is 1.4e-6 m. Wait, that's 1.4 micrometers, which is 1400 nm. That sounds a bit large for a slit, but maybe it's correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the conversion. Let me think again. 1 cm is 1e-2 meters. So 14 ×1e-5 cm is 14 ×1e-5 ×1e-2 m = 14 ×1e-7 m = 1.4 ×1e-6 m, which is 1.4 micrometers. Hmm, okay.

Now, for part a), the wavelength is 400 micrometers? Wait, 400 micrometers is 400e-6 meters, which is 400,000 nm. Wait, that's 400,000 nm, which is way beyond visible light. Visible light is about 400-700 nm. So perhaps the question has a typo, maybe it's 400 nm? Because 400 micrometers is infrared or something else. Let me check the question again.

Wait, the question says "wavelength a) 400m\mu, b) 700m\mu." Oh, I see, the notation is a bit unclear. It might be 400 nm and 700 nm. Because 400 meters is way too big, but 400 nanometers is visible light. So I think the intended wavelengths are 400 nm and 700 nm.

So, for a), λ = 400 nm = 400e-9 m. For b), λ=700e-9 m.

So, the slit width d is 14e-5 cm, which is 14e-7 m, as I calculated earlier.

Now, for each case, compute θ = arcsin(λ/d).

But wait, let's plug in the numbers.

Case a):

λ = 400e-9 m.

d = 14e-5 cm = 14e-7 m.

So, λ/d = (400e-9)/(14e-7) = (400/14) * (1e-9 / 1e-7) ) = (approx 28.57) * (1e-2) ) = 0.2857.

Wait, let me calculate that again.

400e-9 divided by 14e-7 is (400e-9)/(14e-7) = (400 / 14) * (1e-9 / 1e-7) = (28.5714) * (1e-2) ) = 0.285714.

So sinθ = 0.2857.

So θ = arcsin(0.2857) ≈ 16.6 degrees. Wait, because sin(16°) is about 0.2756, sin(17°)=0.2924. Hmm, 0.2857 is between 16 and 17 degrees. Let me compute it more accurately.

Using a calculator, sin(16.6 degrees) ≈ sin(16 + 0.6) = sin(16) + 0.6*(sin(17)-sin(16)).

sin(16)=0.275637, sin(17)=0.292372.

So 0.275637 + 0.6*(0.292372 - 0.275637) = 0.275637 + 0.6*(0.016735) = 0.275637 + 0.010041 = 0.285678, which is very close to 0.2857. So θ ≈ 16.6 degrees.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Because 14e-5 cm is 14e-7 m. Let me double-check:

14e-5 cm = 14e-5 × 1e-2 m = 14e-7 m. Yes, that's correct.

So for a) 400 nm, θ is approximately 16.6 degrees.

Case b): λ=700 nm.

So λ=700e-9 m.

So λ/d = 700e-9 /14e-7 = (700/14) * (1e-9/1e-7) )= 50 * 1e-2 = 5.0.

Wait, that's 5. So sinθ=5?

Wait, that can't be right, because sinθ can't be more than 1. So that would imply that the angle is beyond 90 degrees, which isn't possible in this context because the first minimum would be beyond that, but that can't happen.

Wait, so I must have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.

λ=700e-9 m, d=14e-7 m.

So λ/d = 700e-9 /14e-7 = (700 /14) * (1e-9 /1e-7) )= 50 * (1e-2) )= 5.0 * 1e-2= 0.5.

Ah, I see, I messed up the exponents.

Wait, 700e-9 is 7e-7 m, and 14e-7 is 1.4e-6 m? Wait, no. Wait, 14e-5 cm is 14e-5 × 1e-2 m = 1.4e-6 m, which is 14e-7 m. So 700e-9 m is 7e-7 m.

So λ/d = (7e-7 m) / (14e-7 m) = 0.5.

So sinθ = 0.5. So θ = 30 degrees.

Wait, that makes sense. Because for m=1, θ is 30 degrees when λ/d = 0.5. Because sin(30)=0.5.

So for part a), θ is approximately 16.6 degrees, and for part b), θ is 30 degrees.

But wait, the question is asking for the half-angular breadth, which is just θ, so the answers would be a) ~16.6 degrees, b) 30 degrees.

Looking at the options, option H says 16.6 degrees and 30 degrees. So option H is the correct one.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through the calculations again.

For a) λ=400 nm = 400e-9 m.

d=14e-5 cm =14e-5 *1e-2 m =14e-7 m.

λ/d =400e-9 /14e-7 = (400e-9)/(14e-7) = (400/14) * (1e-9/1e-7) )= (28.5714) * (0.01) )=0.285714.

sinθ=0.2857 → θ ≈16.6 degrees.

For b) λ=700e-9 m.

λ/d=700e-9 /14e-7 =700e-9 /14e-7 = (700/14) * (1e-9/1e-7) )=50 * 0.01 =0.5.

So sinθ=0.5 → θ=30 degrees.

So the half-angular breadths are 16.6 degrees and 30 degrees, which matches option H.

To determine the half-angular breadth of the central bright band in the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern, we use the formula for the first minimum in single-slit diffraction:

\[
\sin\theta = \frac{\lambda}{d}
\]

where:
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the light,
- \( d \) is the width of the slit.

### Given Data:
- Slit width: \( d = 14 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{cm} = 14 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} = 1.4 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \),
- Wavelengths: \( \lambda_a = 400 \, \text{nm} = 400 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \), \( \lambda_b = 700 \, \text{nm} = 700 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \).

### Calculations:
#### Case (a): \( \lambda = 400 \, \text{nm} \)
\[
\sin\theta_a = \frac{\lambda_a}{d} = \frac{400 \times 10^{-9}}{14 \times 10^{-7}} = \frac{400}{14 \times 100} = \frac{400}{1400} \approx 0.2857
\]
\[
\theta_a = \arcsin(0.2857) \approx 16.6^\circ
\]

#### Case (b): \( \lambda = 700 \, \text{nm} \)
\[
\sin\theta_b = \frac{\lambda_b}{d} = \frac{700 \times 10^{-9}}{14 \times 10^{-7}} = \frac{700}{14 \times 100} = \frac{700}{1400} = 0.5
\]
\[
\theta_b = \arcsin(0.5) = 30^\circ
\]

### Final Answer:
The half-angular breadths for the given wavelengths are approximately \( 16.6^\circ \) and \( 30^\circ \), which corresponds to **Option H**.
