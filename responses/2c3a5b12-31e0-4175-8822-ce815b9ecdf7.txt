Okay, so I have this question about discounts and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. The question is asking how to express the discount series 20-10% as a single discount. The options given are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I need to understand what "20-10%" means in terms of discounts. I think it's a series of two discounts applied one after the other. So maybe the first discount is 20%, and then the second discount is 10% on the reduced price. Alternatively, it could be that the discounts are combined in a different way, but I think the usual way is sequential.

Let me break it down step by step. Suppose the original price of an item is $100. Applying the first discount of 20% would reduce the price. So 20% of 100 is $20, so the new price is $80. Now, applying the second discount of 10% on this new price. 10% of 80 is $8, so the final price would be $72.

Wait, but the question is about the total discount from the original price. The original price is $100, and the final price after both discounts is $72. So the total discount is 100 - 72 = $28. So that's a 28% discount overall because 28 is 28% of 100.

So the combined discount is 28%, which would be option A. But let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Sometimes, when combining discounts, people might think of adding them directly, like 20% + 10% = 30%, but that's not correct because the second discount is applied to the already reduced price, not the original.

Alternatively, another way to calculate the combined discount is to use the formula for successive discounts. The formula is: overall discount = 1 - (1 - d1) * (1 - d2), where d1 and d2 are the decimal forms of the discounts.

So, d1 is 20%, which is 0.2, and d2 is 10%, which is 0.1. Plugging into the formula: 1 - (0.8) * (0.9) = 1 - 0.72 = 0.28, which is 28%. So that confirms it.

Wait, but let me think again. If the discounts are applied in the reverse order, would that change anything? Let's see. If I first apply 10% and then 20%. So starting with $100, 10% off is $10, so $90. Then 20% off on $90 is $18, so the final price is $72 again. So regardless of the order, the total discount ends up the same because multiplication is commutative. So 0.8 * 0.9 is the same as 0.9 * 0.8, both giving 0.72, so 28% discount.

Therefore, the correct answer should be 28%, which is option A.

The discount series 20% followed by 10% is calculated by applying each discount sequentially. Using the formula for combined discounts, the overall discount is 28%.
