Okay, so I have this question about Phineas Gage's brain injury. I remember hearing about him in my psychology class. Let me think. Phineas Gage was a railroad worker, right? He had an accident where a metal rod went through his head.

The question is asking which part of his brain was damaged. The options are A to J, including areas like parietal lobe, occipital lobe, hypothalamus, cerebellum, and others.

From what I recall, the accident caused significant changes in his personality. Before the accident, he was described as a responsible and hardworking man, but after the injury, he became impulsive and had trouble making decisions. That makes me think about the areas of the brain associated with decision-making and personality.

I think the prefrontal cortex is responsible for things like planning, decision-making, and social behavior. The prefrontal cortex is part of the frontal lobe. So, if the rod went through his head, it probably damaged the front part of his brain, which would be the frontal lobe. The prefrontal cortex is within the frontal lobe, so that's likely the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure. The rod entered his left cheek and exited through his skull. His brain damage was in the front part, so the frontal lobe. The prefrontal cortex is the front part of the frontal lobe, so that's where damage would occur.

Other options: The parietal lobe is more about sensory information and spatial orientation. Occipital is vision. Hypothalamus is about hormones and basic drives. Cerebellum is motor control, balance. Hippocampus is memory. Corpus callosum connects the two hemispheres. Thalamus relays sensory info. Medulla oblongata is in the brainstem, controlling vital functions like breathing. Temporal lobe is for hearing and memory.

So none of the other options fit as well as the prefrontal cortex, which is G.

The part of Phineas Gage's brain that was damaged was the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for decision-making and personality.
