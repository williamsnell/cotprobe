Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem to solve. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about calculating the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for an isothermal expansion of nitrogen gas. Alright, let's start by recalling what I know.

The problem states that 2.5 mmol of N₂ gas occupies 42 cm³ at 300 K and expands isothermally to 600 cm³. I need to find ΔG for this process.

First, I remember that for an isothermal process (constant temperature), the change in Gibbs free energy can be calculated using the formula ΔG = nRT ln(V₂/V₁). Wait, but wait—am I mixing up formulas? Oh right, for an ideal gas undergoing an isothermal process, the change in Gibbs free energy is given by ΔG = nRT ln(V₂/V₁). Alternatively, sometimes I've seen it expressed using pressure instead of volume, but since volume is given here, I'll stick with that.

Let me write down the formula again to make sure: ΔG = n R T ln(V₂ / V₁). Right, because when temperature is constant, the work done is pressure-volume work, and for an ideal gas, the internal energy doesn't change, so ΔU is zero. Then, the first law tells me that ΔU = Q - W, so Q = W. But I'm getting into the Gibbs equation now. Anyway, the formula is what I need here.

Now, let's plug in the values. First, I need to convert all units appropriately.

n is given as 2.5 mmol. Oh wait, millimole. I should convert that to moles. So 2.5 mmol is 2.5 × 10^-3 mol.

R is the gas constant. I remember R can be used in different units, but since the volume is in cm³, which is 10^-6 m³, but wait, maybe I should convert cm³ to m³. Alternatively, I can use R in L·atm/(mol·K). Wait, let me think: 42 cm³ is 42 mL, which is 0.042 L. Similarly, 600 cm³ is 0.6 L. Maybe it's easier to use R in L·atm/(mol·K) because the volume would then be in liters. Wait, but I also need to make sure that the units for pressure and volume are consistent with R's units.

Alternatively, perhaps using R in J/(mol·K) is better because the answer is in J. Let me check. R is 8.314 J/(mol·K). So if I use that, then I'll have to make sure the volume is in m³. Because 1 m³ is 10^6 liters, wait no, 1 m³ is 1000 liters. Wait, no: 1 liter is 1000 cm³, so 1 m³ is 10^6 liters. Wait, no: 1 m³ is (100 cm)^3 = 1,000,000 cm³, which is 1000 liters. Wait, no, 1 liter is 1000 cm³, so 1 m³ is 1000 liters. So 42 cm³ is 0.042 liters, and 600 cm³ is 0.6 liters.

Wait, but using R in J/(mol·K) would require volume in m³. Alternatively, using R in L·atm/(mol·K) would require pressure in atm and volume in liters. Hmm, perhaps using the latter would be easier because the volumes here are in liters when converted.

So let me choose R as 8.314 J/(mol·K). But then I need the volumes in m³.

Wait, 42 cm³ is 42 × 10^-6 m³, because 1 m³ is 10^6 cm³. So 42 cm³ = 42e-6 m³ = 4.2e-5 m³? Wait, no: 1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³, so 42 cm³ is 42e-6 m³ = 4.2e-5 m³. Similarly, 600 cm³ is 600e-6 m³ = 6e-4 m³.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to convert everything into liters, but with R in L·atm/(mol·K). Let me think: R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). Then, the volume in liters is 0.042 and 0.6. The formula would then be ΔG = nRT ln(V2/V1), but wait, since we're using R in L·atm, the pressure would be in atm. But wait, I'm not given pressure, so perhaps it's better to compute using the ideal gas law. Or maybe I can compute the pressure and then proceed.

Wait, maybe I can calculate the initial pressure, then use that to find the final pressure, and then compute work done, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula ΔG = nRT ln(V2/V1) is correct, but I have to ensure the units are consistent.

Wait, but wait a second. The formula for ΔG when the process is isothermal for an ideal gas is ΔG = nRT ln(V2/V1), but I think that's only true when the process is reversible. Because Gibbs free energy change under constant temperature and pressure is related to the maximum useful work, which for expansion is the reversible work. So I think the formula applies here.

So let's proceed. n = 2.5e-3 mol, R = 8.314 J/(mol·K), T = 300 K.

V1 = 42 cm³ = 42e-6 m³ = 4.2e-5 m³.

V2 = 600 cm³ = 600e-6 m³ = 6e-4 m³.

So ΔG = n R T ln(V2/V1).

Plugging in the numbers:

n = 2.5e-3 mol.

R = 8.314 J/(mol·K).

T = 300 K.

V2/V1 = 600 / 42 ≈ 14.2857.

So ln(14.2857) is approximately ln(14.2857) ≈ 2.66 (since ln(10)=2.3026, ln(14.2857)= about 2.66).

Wait, let me calculate it more accurately. 14.2857 is 100/7 ≈ 14.2857. Let's compute ln(100/7). Let me use a calculator.

Wait, 100/7 is approximately 14.2857. Let me compute ln(14.2857):

Using natural logarithm:

ln(14.2857) = ?

I know that ln(14) is about 2.6391, and ln(14.2857) is a bit higher. Alternatively, using the exact value:

ln(100/7) = ln(100) - ln(7) ≈ 4.6052 - 1.9459 ≈ 2.6593.

So approximately 2.6593.

So now, let's compute ΔG:

ΔG = (2.5e-3) * 8.314 * 300 * ln(14.2857)

Let me compute step by step.

First, 2.5e-3 mol * 8.314 J/(mol·K) = 2.5e-3 * 8.314 ≈ 0.020785 J/(K).

Wait, no: 2.5e-3 *8.314 = 0.020785 J/(mol·K) * mol? Wait, the units would be J because n is in mol, R is J/(mol·K), T is K. So nRT is in J.

So nRT = 2.5e-3 * 8.314 * 300.

Let me compute that:

2.5e-3 * 8.314 = (2.5 * 8.314) * 1e-3 = 20.785 * 1e-3 = 0.020785.

Then multiply by 300: 0.020785 * 300 = 6.2355 J.

So nRT is approximately 6.2355 J.

Now multiply by ln(14.2857) ≈ 2.6593.

So ΔG ≈ 6.2355 J * 2.6593 ≈ ?

Let me compute 6 * 2.6593 = 15.9558.

0.2355 * 2.6593 ≈ approximately 0.2355 * 2.66 ≈ 0.626.

So total is approximately 15.9558 + 0.626 ≈ 16.58 J.

Wait, but wait a second. The options are all negative. Because when a gas expands isothermally, the change in Gibbs free energy is negative because the system is doing work on the surroundings, and since it's isothermal, the internal energy doesn't change, so ΔG is negative. Wait, no—wait, Gibbs free energy change for the system. Let me think: for an expansion, the gas does work, so the system's energy decreases. But I'm not entirely sure about the sign. Wait, the formula I used is ΔG = nRT ln(V2/V1). Since V2 > V1, ln(V2/V1) is positive, so ΔG would be positive. But wait, that can't be right because I thought the answer options are negative. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, no, perhaps I have the formula wrong. Because I think the formula for Gibbs free energy change when the process is isothermal is ΔG = nRT ln(P₁/P₂), where P is pressure. Wait, but I'm given volume, so perhaps it's better to express it in terms of volume. Let me double-check.

Wait, no, the formula is ΔG = nRT ln(V2/V1) for expansion. But that would give a positive value, but the options don't have a positive value. Wait, but wait, perhaps I should be using the reciprocal. Because when the system expands, the volume increases, so if the process is spontaneous, the change in Gibbs free energy should be negative. Hmm, perhaps I have the formula wrong.

Wait, another approach: For an ideal gas undergoing an isothermal reversible expansion, the work done is W = nRT ln(V2/V1). And since ΔU = 0 (because internal energy depends only on temperature for ideal gas), then ΔG = ΔU + W = 0 + W = W. Wait, but wait, no: Gibbs free energy is ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. Or, for isothermal processes: ΔG = nRT ln(V2/V1). Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is ΔG = nRT ln(P1/P2), because when pressure decreases, the Gibbs free energy decreases. So if the volume increases, pressure decreases, so P1 > P2, so ln(P1/P2) is positive, leading to a positive ΔG. But that would be positive, but the options are negative. Hmm, perhaps I should re-examine the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that for the expansion, the system is doing work, so the Gibbs free energy should decrease. So ΔG should be negative. But according to my calculation, it's positive. That suggests I might have the formula inverted.

Wait, let me think about Gibbs free energy change in terms of work. For a reversible process at constant temperature, the maximum work is W = -nRT ln(V2/V1). So the work done by the system is positive when V2 > V1, so W is positive. Then, since ΔG = W, but wait, ΔG = W only under constant T and pressure. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using pressure. Let me compute the initial and final pressures using the ideal gas law, then compute ΔG.

The ideal gas law is PV = nRT. Since the process is isothermal, T is constant, so P1 V1 = P2 V2.

So P1 = (nRT)/V1, and P2 = (nRT)/V2.

So the ratio P1/P2 = V2/V1.

So ln(P1/P2) = ln(V2/V1).

So ΔG = nRT ln(P1/P2) = nRT ln(V2/V1).

Wait, so the formula is correct as I used it earlier. So in that case, my calculation gives ΔG ≈ 16.58 J, which is positive. But looking at the options, all the answers are negative except I, which is 0 J. So I must have made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, perhaps the formula is ΔG = -nRT ln(V2/V1). Because when the system does work, the Gibbs free energy decreases, so ΔG should be negative. Hmm. Let me check.

Wait, let me think about the second law. For an isothermal expansion, the system does work, so the surroundings receive energy. But since it's isothermal, the internal energy doesn't change, so the change in Gibbs free energy should be negative because the system's free energy decreases as it does work.

Wait, but the formula I used gives a positive value. So perhaps I have the formula wrong. Maybe it's ΔG = -nRT ln(V2/V1). Let me check a reference.

Wait, I'm recalling that for the Gibbs free energy change when a gas expands isothermally reversibly, ΔG = nRT ln(V2/V1). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think about entropy. The change in entropy ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1). So for an isothermal process, ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. Since ΔH = ΔU + Δ(PV) and for ideal gas, ΔU is zero, so ΔH = nR T ln(V2/V1). Wait, no, because ΔH for ideal gas is nCp ΔT, but since T is constant, ΔH is zero. Wait, no, wait: For ideal gas, ΔH = nCp ΔT. Since T is constant, ΔH is zero. Then, ΔG = ΔH - TΔS = 0 - T*(nR ln(V2/V1)) ) = -nRT ln(V2/V1).

Oh! So that's where I went wrong. The correct formula is ΔG = -nRT ln(V2/V1). Because ΔG = VΔP - SΔT + ... but perhaps better to think via the formula ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. Since ΔH is zero (isothermal), ΔG = -TΔS. And ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1), so ΔG = -nRT ln(V2/V1).

So now, my calculation would be ΔG = - (2.5e-3 mol) * (8.314 J/mol·K) * 300 K * ln(600/42).

So let me compute that again with the negative sign.

nRT = 2.5e-3 * 8.314 * 300 ≈ 6.2355 J.

ln(600/42) ≈ 2.6593.

So ΔG = -6.2355 * 2.6593 ≈ -16.58 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option J: -17 J. But let me compute more accurately.

Wait, let me compute 6.2355 * 2.6593.

6 * 2.6593 = 15.9558.

0.2355 * 2.6593 ≈ 0.2355*2=0.471, 0.2355*0.6593≈0.155. So total ≈0.471 + 0.155=0.626.

So total ≈15.9558 + 0.626≈16.5818 J.

So ΔG ≈ -16.58 J, which rounds to -17 J. So the answer would be option J: -17 J.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option J is -17 J. So that's the correct choice.

To calculate the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for the isothermal expansion of nitrogen gas, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta G = -nRT \ln\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right)
\]

### Step 1: Convert units
- The amount of substance \( n = 2.5 \, \text{mmol} = 2.5 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{mol} \).
- The gas constant \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \).
- The temperature \( T = 300 \, \text{K} \).
- Initial volume \( V_1 = 42 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^3 = 4.2 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{m}^3 \).
- Final volume \( V_2 = 600 \, \text{cm}^3 = 600 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^3 = 6 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m}^3 \).

### Step 2: Calculate the volume ratio
\[
\frac{V_2}{V_1} = \frac{600}{42} \approx 14.2857
\]

### Step 3: Compute the natural logarithm
\[
\ln\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right) = \ln(14.2857) \approx 2.6593
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( nRT \)
\[
nRT = (2.5 \times 10^{-3}) \cdot 8.314 \cdot 300 \approx 6.2355 \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 5: Compute ΔG
\[
\Delta G = -nRT \ln\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right) = -6.2355 \cdot 2.6593 \approx -16.58 \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 6: Match the closest option
The calculated value of \( \Delta G \approx -16.58 \, \text{J} \) rounds to \( -17 \, \text{J} \), which corresponds to option **J**.
