Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this tax question about filing status after a spouse dies. Let me break it down step by step.

The question says that a spouse died on December 31, year 1, and the couple had no dependents. Now, we need to determine the surviving spouse's filing status for year 2.

First, I remember that when a spouse dies, the surviving spouse can file as a "widow" or "widower" in the year of death and the following year. But wait, the options include both "Widow(er)" and "Qualifying Widow(er)" and others.

I think the key here is whether there are dependents. The question says there are no dependents. So, if there are no dependents, the surviving spouse can't file as a head of household or as a widow with a dependent. Let me check the definitions.

Qualifying Widow(er) status is available for two years after the year of the spouse's death. The main requirements are that the spouse died in the previous year, the surviving spouse hasn't remarried, and either the surviving spouse has a dependent or files as a qualifying widow(er). Wait, but in this case, there are no dependents. So does that affect it?

Wait, I think the qualifying widow(er) status doesn't require the surviving spouse to have a dependent child. Let me confirm. I recall that for the first two years after the spouse's death, the surviving spouse can file as a qualifying widow(er), even without a dependent. Because the qualifying widow rules don't require a dependent child; it's more about the marital status and the time frame.

So in year 2, the surviving spouse is still within the two-year window (since the death was in year 1). Therefore, the filing status should be "Qualifying Widow(er)".

Looking at the options, I see option I is "Qualifying widow(er)." Option F is "Widow(er) with dependent child," which doesn't apply because there are no dependents. Option B is similar but also requires a dependent, so it's not applicable here.

Other options: If there were dependents, the spouse could file as head of household (G) or widow with dependent (F). But since there are no dependents, those don't apply. They aren't single because they were married in the previous year. They can't file as married filing separately (D) or jointly (E) because the spouse is deceased. Nonresident alien (A) and dependent of another taxpayer (J) don't fit here. So the only correct choice is I: Qualifying widow(er).

The surviving spouse can file as a "Qualifying Widow(er)" in year 2 since the death occurred in year 1, and they are within the two-year eligibility window. This status does not require dependents, so the correct answer is I.

Answer: I
