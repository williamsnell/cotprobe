Okay, so I have this question about Trojans, and I need to figure out which one is a remote Trojan. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that Trojans are a type of malware that disguise themselves as legitimate software to trick users into installing them. They can do various things once inside a system. Now, the question is specifically asking about a "remote Trojan." I think that refers to a Trojan that allows remote control of the infected computer. So, it's a type of malware that gives the attacker access to the victim's machine from afar.

Looking at the options:

A: Troya
B: DaCryptic
C: BankerA
D: Game-Troj

I'm trying to recall what each of these Trojans does. Troya comes to mind as a banking Trojan, used for stealing financial information. DaCryptic might be a ransomware, which is different because it encrypts files and asks for a ransom. BankerA sounds like another banking Trojan, possibly stealing credentials. Game-Troj... I'm not too sure about that one, but maybe it's related to gaming or something else.

Wait, I think I've heard that Game-Troj is a remote access Trojan. That would mean it allows the attacker to remotely control the infected computer, which fits the definition of a remote Trojan. So, option D, Game-Troj, is likely the correct answer.

I should double-check my memory. Troya and BankerA are both banking Trojans, so they're more about stealing info rather than remote access. DaCryptic, as I thought, is probably ransomware. So, the only one left that's a remote access Trojan is D: Game-Troj.

The correct answer is D: Game-Troj, as it is identified as a remote access Trojan.
