The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Long was a purchasing agent for Frost, a sole proprietor. Long had express authority to place purchase orders with Frost's suppliers. Long conducted business on the Internet and had little contact with Frost. After Frost was declared incompetent in a judicial proceeding, Long placed an order with Grant Corp. on Frost's behalf. Both Long and Grant were unaware of Frost's incompetence. Will Frost or Frost's legal representative be liable to Grant?

Options:

A: No, because Grant should have verified Frost's competency.
B: No, because the law protects those declared incompetent from contractual obligations.
C: Yes, because the contract was conducted online.
D: No, because Grant dealt only with Long.
E: Yes, because the order was valid regardless of Frost's incompetence.
F: No, because Frost's incompetence voided the agency relationship.
G: No, because Long did not have authority to enter into the contract.
H: Yes, because Long had express authority to place orders.
I: Yes, because Long's agency survived Frost's incompetence.
J: Yes, because the order was placed before Frost was declared incompetent.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about agency and incompetence. Let me break it down step by step.

The question is about whether Frost or his legal representative will be liable to Grant Corp. after Long placed an order. Frost was declared incompetent, and Long was acting as a purchasing agent with express authority. I remember that express authority means the agent has clear permission to act on behalf of the principal.

So, the key points here are: Long had express authority to place purchase orders. He did this on the internet with Grant Corp., and neither Long nor Grant knew about Frost's incompetence. Frost was declared incompetent, which means he can't manage his own affairs anymore, including contracts.

I'm trying to recall the rules about agency when the principal becomes incompetent. Normally, if an agent has express authority, the principal is bound by the agent's actions. But what happens when the principal is incompetent?

I think that even if the principal becomes incompetent, the agency relationship continues unless it's a type of agency that would terminate upon the principal's incompetence. Express authority typically continues because it's about the agent's ability to act, not the principal's mental state.

So, Long had the authority to place orders, and he did so. Grant Corp. didn't know about Frost's incompetence, so they would have dealt with Long in good faith. Since Long was acting within his authority, the contract should be valid. Therefore, Frost or his legal rep would be liable because the contract stands.

Looking at the options, let's go through them:

A: No, because Grant should have verified Frost's competency. I don't think Grant is required to verify; they dealt with the agent who had authority.

B: No, because incompetence voids contracts. That's not right because the agent's actions bind the principal if within authority.

C: Yes, because online. Not sure about this; the medium doesn't affect liability here.

D: No, because Grant dealt with Long. But Long was acting within his authority, so Grant would be fine, but the question is about whether Frost is liable. I think he is because the agent's actions are his.

E: Yes, because the order was valid. This seems correct because the agent's authority continues.

F: No, incompetence voided the agency. I don't think so; express authority usually continues.

G: No, Long didn't have authority. But he did have express authority, so G is wrong.

H: Yes, because Long had express authority. That's true, but the question is whether the contract is binding on Frost despite his incompetence.

I: Yes, because agency survived. This aligns with what I was thinking earlier.

J: Yes, because the order was before the declaration. That might not matter because even if declared after, the contract is still valid unless it's a voidable contract.

Wait, but when a principal becomes incompetent, any contracts entered by the agent are generally valid unless the agent is beyond their authority or the contract is something the incompetent principal would not have done. But since express authority allows the agent to act, the contract should be binding.

So, between H and I. H says yes because of express authority. I says yes because the agency survived. Both are correct, but the better answer is I because it's about the agency continuing despite incompetence, which is the main point.

Wait, but the options are a bit tricky. Let me think again. The question is whether Frost is liable. Since the agent had express authority, the principal is liable regardless of incompetence unless the agent was acting beyond that authority.

So, H says yes because Long had express authority. That's correct because the authority allows the contract to bind. I says yes because the agency survived. Both H and I seem correct, but perhaps I is more accurate in explaining why the agent can still act.

But wait, the question is whether Frost is liable. If the agent had authority, then yes. So H is correct because express authority allows the contract to stand.

Alternatively, the fact that the agent's authority continues even when the principal is incompetent supports option I.

Hmm, the correct rule is that when a principal becomes incompetent, the agency continues unless it's a type that terminates upon such an event. So the agent's authority remains, making the contract valid against the principal. Therefore, the correct answer would be H or I.

Wait, but I think the better answer is H because it directly points to the express authority. But I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should look up the rules again.

Upon checking, the general rule is that the principal is bound by the agent's actions if the agent was acting within express or implied authority, even if the principal later becomes incompetent. So, the contract is valid, and the principal (or their rep) is liable.

So the answer should be H: Yes, because Long had express authority to place orders.

Wait, but I thought I was also correct. But perhaps H is more directly applicable because it's about the express authority, which allows the contract to be valid regardless of the principal's incompetence.

So, I think the correct answer is H.

The correct answer is **H: Yes, because Long had express authority to place orders.** 

Long, as Frost's purchasing agent, had express authority to place orders, and the fact that Frost became incompetent does not negate the validity of the contract. The agent's authority continues unless the agency relationship is terminated, which did not happen here. Therefore, Frost or his legal representative will be liable to Grant Corp. 

**Answer: H**
