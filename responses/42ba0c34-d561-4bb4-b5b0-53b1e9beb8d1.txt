Okay, so I've got this problem about a heat pump. Hmm, I remember heat pumps are used to move heat from one place to another, right? Like, they can take heat from outside and bring it inside to warm up the place. The question says the outdoor temperature is 7°C and the indoor temperature is 27°C. For every 15,000 J of heat delivered indoors, I need to find the minimum work required. The options are A to J, so I'll have to calculate it and see which one it matches.

Wait, I think this involves the concept of the coefficient of performance (COP) for a heat pump. COP tells us how efficient the heat pump is at moving heat. The higher the COP, the less work is needed. But wait, COP depends on the temperatures involved. Oh right, the formula for the COP of a heat pump in a ideal scenario (like a Carnot cycle) is COP = T_hot / (T_hot - T_cold), where T is in Kelvin.

So first, I need to convert those temperatures to Kelvin. Outdoor temp is 7°C, so adding 273 gives 280 K. Indoor is 27°C, which is 300 K. So T_hot is 300 K and T_cold is 280 K. Wait, no, wait—actually, no, in a heat pump, the hot reservoir is the inside, where we're delivering heat, so T_hot is the higher temperature, and T_cold is the outside. So T_hot is 300 K, T_cold is 280 K.

So COP = 300 / (300 - 280) = 300 / 20 = 15. So the COP is 15. That means for every unit of work, the heat pump can deliver 15 units of heat. Wait, no, wait. Wait, COP is the heat delivered divided by the work input. So COP = Q_h / W, where Q_h is the heat delivered.

So rearranging, W = Q_h / COP. Oh right, so if Q_h is 15,000 J, then W = 15000 / 15 = 1000 J. So the work needed would be 1000 J. Let me check the options. Option B is 1000 J. But wait, I should make sure I didn't mix up the temperatures. Because sometimes I get confused whether it's T_high over (T_high - T_low). Let me see: yes, for a heat pump, the COP is T_hot / (T_hot - T_cold). So 300/(300-280)=15. So 15000 /15 = 1000 J, which is option B.

Wait, but wait another thing. Sometimes, depending on the convention, the COP might be expressed differently. Like, sometimes it's the heat delivered divided by the work input, which is what I used. So I think that's correct. Let me double-check the formula. Yep, COP for heat pump is Qh / W. So yeah, 15000 /15 is 1000 J. So the answer should be B.

To determine the minimum work required for the heat pump, we use the coefficient of performance (COP) formula for a heat pump, which is given by:

\[
\text{COP} = \frac{T_{\text{hot}}}{T_{\text{hot}} - T_{\text{cold}}}
\]

Here, \(T_{\text{hot}}\) is the indoor temperature (27°C = 300 K) and \(T_{\text{cold}}\) is the outdoor temperature (7°C = 280 K). Substituting these values:

\[
\text{COP} = \frac{300}{300 - 280} = \frac{300}{20} = 15
\]

The COP represents the heat delivered per unit of work input. The formula for work (\(W\)) is:

\[
W = \frac{Q_h}{\text{COP}}
\]

Given \(Q_h = 15,000 \, \text{J}\) and \(\text{COP} = 15\):

\[
W = \frac{15,000}{15} = 1,000 \, \text{J}
\]

Thus, the minimum work required is approximately **1,000 J**, corresponding to option B.
