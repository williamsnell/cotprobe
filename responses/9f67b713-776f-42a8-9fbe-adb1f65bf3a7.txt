Okay, so I have this question about evaluating the rotational partition function at high temperatures using the Euler-Maclaurin summation formula. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

First, I remember that the rotational partition function, q_rot, is usually expressed in terms of the rotational temperature Θ_rot and the symmetry number σ. But wait, the exact expression might depend on whether the molecule is linear or nonlinear. Oh right, for linear molecules, the rotational partition function at high temperatures is given by q_rot ≈ Θ_rot / (σ T), but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, high temperature usually means that the rotational energy levels are widely spaced and thermalized, so maybe it's a different expression.

Wait, the Euler-Maclaurin formula relates sums to integrals. The formula is something like ∑_{n=a}^∞ f(n) = ∫_a^∞ f(x) dx + (1/2)f(a) - (1/12)f'(a) + ... So in this problem, we're supposed to use this to evaluate the partition function.

The partition function for rotation is generally q_rot ≈ ∑_{n=0}^∞ g_n * exp(-E_n/(kT)), where g_n is the degeneracy. For a linear molecule, E_n = n(n+1)ħ²/(2I), and each state has degeneracy (2n+1), but I think for high temperatures, the sum can be approximated as an integral.

Wait, but the problem says to use Euler-Maclaurin. So maybe the sum is approximated by an integral plus correction terms. Let me try to write the partition function as a sum. For high T, the exponential terms decrease slowly, but maybe the sum can be approximated as an integral.

So the sum would be something like q_rot = ∑_{n=0}^∞ (2n+1) exp( -n(n+1)θ_rot / T ), where θ_rot is the rotational temperature, defined as ħ²/(2I k). But wait, θ_rot is often written as Θ_rot, so maybe I should use that notation.

Wait, but at high temperatures (kT >> rotational energy levels), the exponentials are not too small, so the sum can be approximated by an integral. So applying Euler-Maclaurin, the sum can be approximated by the integral plus some correction terms.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about how exactly to apply Euler-Maclaurin here. Let me think of f(n) as (2n+1) exp( -n(n+1)θ_rot/(T) ). So f(n) = (2n+1) exp( -n(n+1)θ_rot/(T) ), and we're summing from n=0 to ∞.

Wait, but Euler-Maclaurin is used when the sum starts at some a, but here a is 0. So the formula would give ∑_{n=0}^∞ f(n) ≈ ∫_{0}^∞ f(x) dx + (1/2)f(0) - (1/12)f'(0) + ... etc.

But wait, the integral ∫_{0}^∞ (2x+1) exp( -x(x+1)θ_rot/(T) ) dx. Hmm, that integral might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the rotational partition function can be expressed in a way that's easier to handle.

Wait, I think for high temperatures, the rotational partition function can be approximated as q_rot ≈ (kT/ħ²) I^{-1} σ, where I is the moment of inertia. Alternatively, I might be mixing this up with the expression for the translational partition function.

Wait, rotational temperature Θ_rot is defined as (ħ²)/(2I k), so I = ħ²/(2 k Θ_rot). So substituting that into q_rot, which for linear molecules is (σ Θ_rot) / (2 π^2) ∫_{0}^∞ x^2 exp(-x Θ_rot/(T)) dx/(x^2) )? No, perhaps I'm complicating it.

Alternatively, for high temperatures, the rotational partition function tends to be proportional to T/σ. Because when T is high, the rotational modes are active, and the partition function increases with temperature.

Looking at the options, option I is T / Θ_rot. Option C is T * (σ Θ_rot). Option G is (σ Θ_rot)/T, which would be the opposite of what I'm thinking. Wait, but I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the rotational partition function for a linear molecule at high temperatures is q_rot ≈ (σ T) / Θ_rot. Let me think. Because at high T, the rotational energy levels are closely spaced compared to thermal energy, so the partition function tends to be large. So if T increases, q_rot should increase.

Looking at the options, option I is T / Θ_rot. Option C is T multiplied by σ Θ_rot, which would increase with T, but if Θ_rot is a constant, then option I makes sense. But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the leading term from the Euler-Maclaurin expansion. The sum is approximated by the integral plus correction terms. Let me model f(n) as (2n+1) exp(-n(n+1)θ_rot / T). So f(n) ≈ 2n exp(-n² θ_rot / T) for large n, since n+1 ≈ n when n is large.

So the sum ∑_{n=0}^∞ (2n+1) exp(-n(n+1)θ_rot/(T)) ≈ ∫_{0}^\infty (2x) exp(-x² θ_rot/(T)) dx, ignoring the +1 for large x. Let me compute that integral.

Let u = x² θ_rot/(T) → x = sqrt(T u/(θ_rot)), dx = sqrt(T/(θ_rot)) (1/(2 sqrt(u))) du.

So the integral becomes ∫ (2x) exp(-u) * sqrt(T/(θ_rot)) (1/(2 sqrt(u))) du.

Simplify: 2x = 2 sqrt(T u/θ_rot), so 2 sqrt(T u/θ_rot) * sqrt(T/(θ_rot)) * (1/(2 sqrt(u))) du.

Wait, let me do this more carefully. The integral ∫0^∞ 2x exp(-x² θ_rot/(T)) dx.

Let me make substitution y = x² θ_rot/(T) → x = sqrt(T y / θ_rot), dx = sqrt(T/(θ_rot)) * (1/(2 sqrt(y))) dy.

So the integral becomes ∫0^∞ 2 * sqrt(T y/θ_rot) * exp(-y) * [sqrt(T/(θ_rot)) * (1/(2 sqrt(y))) ] dy.

Simplify the terms: 2 * sqrt(T y/θ_rot) * sqrt(T/(θ_rot)) * (1/(2 sqrt(y))) ) = 2 * [T/(θ_rot)] * (y/(θ_rot T))^{1/2} ) * (1/(2 y^{1/2})) )

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me just compute ∫0^∞ 2x exp(-x² a) dx, where a = θ_rot / T.

Let u = x² a → x = sqrt(u/a), dx = (1/(2 sqrt(a u))) du.

So integral becomes ∫0^∞ 2 * sqrt(u/a) * exp(-u) * (1/(2 sqrt(a u))) ) du.

The 2 and 1/2 cancel. sqrt(u/a) * 1/(sqrt(a u)) ) = 1/(a).

So integral becomes ∫0^∞ exp(-u) du * (1/a) ) = (1/a) * 1 = 1/a = T/θ_rot.

Wait, that can't be right because when a=θ_rot/T, 1/a is T/θ_rot. So the integral ∫0^∞ 2x exp(-x² θ_rot/T) dx = T/θ_rot.

Wait, but that's the integral of 2x exp(-x² a) dx from 0 to ∞, which is indeed 1/a = T/θ_rot.

So the leading term of the sum is approximately T/θ_rot, but I'm not sure if that's the entire story. Wait, but the Euler-Maclaurin formula says that the sum is approximately the integral plus (1/2)f(0) - (1/12)f'(0) + ... 

So f(0) is (2*0+1) exp(0) = 1. So (1/2)*f(0) = 1/2.

What about the next term, -(1/12)f'(0). Let me compute f'(n) at n=0.

f(n) = (2n+1) exp(-n(n+1)θ_rot/T).

So f'(n) = 2 exp(-n(n+1)θ_rot/T) + (2n+1) exp(-n(n+1)θ_rot/T) * [ - (2n +1) θ_rot / T ].

At n=0, f'(0) = 2 exp(0) + (1) exp(0) * (-1 * θ_rot / T ) = 2 - θ_rot / T.

So -(1/12) f'(0) = -(1/12) [2 - θ_rot / T ].

Putting it all together, the sum is approximately ∫f(x)dx + (1/2)f(0) - (1/12)f'(0) + ... 

So the integral is T/θ_rot, plus 1/2, minus (1/12)(2 - θ_rot/T).

So the sum ≈ T/θ_rot + 1/2 - (2/12) + (θ_rot)/(12 T).

Simplify: 1/2 - 1/6 = (3/6 -1/6)= 2/6=1/3. And (θ_rot)/(12 T) is a small term because T is high, so θ_rot/T is small.

So the sum is approximately T/θ_rot + 1/3 + (θ_rot)/(12 T).

But wait, for high T, the term (θ_rot)/(12 T) is negligible, so the dominant terms are T/θ_rot plus 1/3.

Wait, but in the options, option I is T/Θ_rot, which matches the leading term. But wait, the rotational partition function for a linear molecule at high T is usually given as q_rot ≈ (σ T)/(2 Θ_rot) or something similar. Alternatively, I'm a bit confused because I might be mixing terms.

Wait, let me think again. The rotational partition function for a linear molecule is q_rot = (σ Θ_rot)/(2 π²) ∫_{0}^\infty (x^2) exp(-x Θ_rot/(T)) dx/(x^2) ? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that for high temperatures, the rotational partition function can be approximated as q_rot ≈ (kT / Θ_rot) * σ. Wait, but that would be (T/Θ_rot) multiplied by σ. So if σ is the symmetry number, then maybe the correct expression is (σ T) / Θ_rot.

But looking at the options, option H is T/(σ Θ_rot²), which doesn't fit. Option C is T*σ Θ_rot, which would be proportional to T, which makes sense because q_rot increases with T. Option I is T/Θ_rot, which would be the case if σ=1. Hmm.

Wait, the rotational partition function for a linear molecule is q_rot = (σ Θ_rot)/(2 π²) ∫_{0}^\infty x^2 exp(-x Θ_rot/(T)) dx/(x^2) ), but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression is q_rot ≈ (kT/σ) * something.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The Euler-Maclaurin approach gave the leading term as T/θ_rot, which matches option I: T/Θ_rot. But I'm not considering the symmetry number σ here. Oh, right, the symmetry number comes into play because for a linear molecule, the partition function is q_rot = (σ Θ_rot)/(2 π²) ∫0^∞ x^2 exp(-x Θ_rot/(T)) dx/(x^2). Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing the expressions.

Wait, perhaps the rotational partition function is given by q_rot = (σ Θ_rot)/(2) ∫0^∞ (2x+1) exp(-x Θ_rot/(T)) dx/(x^2). No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the rotational partition function for linear molecules is q_rot = (σ Θ_rot)/(2) ∫0^∞ (2x+1) exp(-x Θ_rot/(T)) dx.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think about the high-temperature limit. At high T, the rotational partition function for a linear molecule is q_rot ≈ (σ T)/(2 Θ_rot) * something. Alternatively, I think that the expression is q_rot ≈ (σ T)/(2 π^2 I) ) or something similar, but I'm not getting anywhere.

Wait, alternatively, I remember that the rotational partition function for a diatomic molecule in the high-temperature limit is q_rot ≈ (σ T)/(2 π c R Θ_rot), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the leading term from the Euler-Maclaurin formula, which gave us T/θ_rot. So the answer would be option I: T/Θ_rot.

But wait, I thought the symmetry number σ comes into play. For example, for a linear molecule, the rotational partition function is q_rot = (σ Θ_rot)/(2) ∫_{0}^\infty x^2 exp(-x Θ_rot/T) dx/(x^2) )? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approximation is q_rot ≈ (T Θ_rot^2)/σ. Wait, that would be option A: (σ Θ_rot^2)/T. No, option A is (σ Θ_rot^2)/T, which is opposite to what I'm thinking.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think differently. The Euler-Maclaurin gives the sum as approximately the integral plus some correction terms. We found the integral to be T/θ_rot. The first correction is 1/2 and then a term that's small. So the leading term is T/θ_rot. But the rotational partition function also factors in the symmetry number σ. So perhaps the actual expression is (T/θ_rot) multiplied by σ. So that would make it σ T / θ_rot, which is option C: T*(σ Θ_rot). Wait, but σ is multiplied by T, which makes sense dimensionally.

Wait, no, because θ_rot has units of temperature, so T/θ_rot is dimensionless. If σ is a pure number, then T/θ_rot multiplied by σ is also a dimensionless quantity, but the partition function is dimensionless. Hmm.

Wait, but I'm not considering the exact form of the partition function. The rotational partition function for a linear molecule is q_rot ≈ (σ Θ_rot)/(2) ∫_{0}^∞ x^2 exp(-x Θ_rot/(T)) dx. Wait, let me compute that integral. Let u = x Θ_rot/T → x = u T/Θ_rot, dx = T/Θ_rot du.

So the integral becomes ∫0^∞ (u T/Θ_rot)^2 exp(-u) * (T/Θ_rot) du.

= (T^3)/(Θ_rot^3) ∫0^∞ u^2 exp(-u) du.

The integral ∫0^∞ u^2 exp(-u) du = Γ(3) = 2! = 2.

So the integral is (T^3)/(Θ_rot^3) * 2.

Putting it back into q_rot: (σ Θ_rot)/(2) * (2 T^3)/(Θ_rot^3) ) = σ T^3 / Θ_rot^2.

Wait, that can't be right because the partition function can't have T^3. So I must have made a mistake in the expression.

Wait, perhaps the correct expression for the rotational partition function is q_rot = (σ Θ_rot)/(2) ∫_{0}^∞ x^2 exp(-x Θ_rot/(T)) dx/(x^2). No, that would cancel x^2, leaving ∫ exp(-x) dx from 0 to ∞, which is 1. So q_rot would be (σ Θ_rot)/(2) * 1, which is σ Θ_rot / 2. That doesn't make sense because it's independent of T, which contradicts the high-T behavior.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to recall the correct high-temperature approximation for the rotational partition function.

For a linear molecule, the rotational partition function is given by q_rot ≈ (σ T)/(2 Θ_rot) for high temperatures. Because at high T, the rotational energy levels are closely spaced, and the partition function increases with T.

Looking at the options, option I is T/Θ_rot, which is similar but doesn't have the σ. Option C is T * σ Θ_rot, which would be larger than T, but I thought it should be T over Θ_rot.

Wait, but where does the σ come in? The symmetry number σ is part of the partition function because it accounts for the number of equivalent orientations. So the correct expression should include σ. If the high-T expression is (σ T)/(2 Θ_rot), then none of the options perfectly match this, but perhaps the leading term is (σ T)/(Θ_rot), which would be option C: T*(σ Θ_rot). Wait, no, option C is T multiplied by σ Θ_rot, which would be TσΘ_rot, which is not the same as (σ T)/(Θ_rot).

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try again.

The rotational partition function for a linear molecule is:

q_rot = (σ Θ_rot)/(2) ∫_{0}^∞ x^2 exp(-x Θ_rot/(T)) dx/(x^2)

Wait, that's not correct. Let me get back to the correct expression. The correct expression for the rotational partition function for a linear molecule is:

q_rot = (σ Θ_rot)/(2) ∫_{0}^∞ x^2 exp(-x Θ_rot/(T)) dx/(x^2).

Wait, no, that would cancel x^2, leading to ∫ exp(-x) dx from 0 to ∞, which is 1. So q_rot = (σ Θ_rot)/(2) * 1 = σ Θ_rot /2. That can't be right because it doesn't depend on T, which is incorrect for high T.

Hmm, perhaps I should look up the formula. Alternatively, I think the correct high-T approximation is q_rot ≈ (σ T)/(2 Θ_rot) * something. But I'm not getting it right.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the rotational energy levels are E = (ħ²/(2I)) n(n+1), and the degeneracy is (2n+1). So the partition function is:

q_rot = ∑_{n=0}^∞ (2n+1) exp( -n(n+1) Θ_rot / T )

Where Θ_rot = (ħ²)/(2I k). So for high T, the exponential is not too small, so the sum can be approximated as an integral.

Using the Euler-Maclaurin formula, the sum is approximately ∫_{0}^∞ (2x+1) exp(-x(x+1) Θ_rot/T ) dx + (1/2)(2*0+1) exp(0) - (1/12)(d/dx (2x+1) exp(-x(x+1) Θ_rot/T )) evaluated at x=0.

We already found the integral approximation as T/θ_rot. Then, the first correction is 1/2.

Now, the derivative term: f(x) = (2x+1) exp(-x(x+1)θ_rot/T )

f'(x) = 2 exp(-x(x+1)θ_rot/T ) + (2x+1) exp(-x(x+1)θ_rot/T ) * (- (2x +1) θ_rot / T )

At x=0: f'(0) = 2 + (1) * (- (1) θ_rot / T ) = 2 - θ_rot / T.

So the correction term is -(1/12) [2 - θ_rot / T ].

So putting it all together:

q_rot ≈ (T/θ_rot) + 1/2 - (1/12)(2 - θ_rot/T )

Simplify the constants: 1/2 - (2/12) = 1/2 - 1/6 = (3/6 -1/6)=2/6=1/3.

So q_rot ≈ T/θ_rot + 1/3 + (θ_rot)/(12 T).

For high T, the (θ_rot)/(12 T) term is negligible, so the leading term is T/θ_rot plus 1/3. But in the options, the only term that matches T/θ_rot is option I: T / Θ_rot.

But considering the symmetry number σ, I think the correct expression should include σ. So perhaps the q_rot is (σ T)/(2 Θ_rot), which would be (σ T)/(2 Θ_rot). But looking at the options, none of the options have this form. The closest is option I: T/Θ_rot, which would be the case if σ=2. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: the rotational partition function can be written as q_rot = (σ Θ_rot)/(2) ∫_{0}^∞ x^2 exp(-x Θ_rot/(T)) dx/(x^2) → no, that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression is q_rot ≈ (σ T)/(2 Θ_rot), which would be option I multiplied by σ/2. But none of the options have this except perhaps option C if we ignore the denominator. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the leading term from Euler-Maclaurin. The sum is approximately T/θ_rot + 1/3. So the dominant term is T/θ_rot. Therefore, the answer should be option I: T/Θ_rot.
</think>

The rotational partition function, \( q_{\text{rot}} \), is evaluated at high temperatures using the Euler-Maclaurin summation formula. For a linear molecule, the rotational energy levels are \( E_n = n(n+1)\Theta_{\text{rot}} \), where \( \Theta_{\text{rot}} \) is the rotational temperature. The partition function is expressed as:

\[
q_{\text{rot}} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (2n+1) \exp\left(-\frac{n(n+1)\Theta_{\text{rot}}}{T}\right).
\]

At high temperatures (\( T \gg \Theta_{\text{rot}} \)), the sum can be approximated as an integral using the Euler-Maclaurin formula. The leading term of the integral is:

\[
\int_0^\infty (2x+1) \exp\left(-\frac{x(x+1)\Theta_{\text{rot}}}{T}\right) dx \approx \frac{T}{\Theta_{\text{rot}}}.
\]

Higher-order correction terms, such as \( \frac{1}{2}f(0) \) and \( -\frac{1}{12}f'(0) \), are smaller and negligible at high \( T \). Thus, the dominant contribution to \( q_{\text{rot}} \) is proportional to \( \frac{T}{\Theta_{\text{rot}}} \).

The symmetry number \( \sigma \) accounts for the number of equivalent orientations of the molecule. For a linear molecule, the rotational partition function at high temperatures is typically expressed as:

\[
q_{\text{rot}} \approx \frac{\sigma T}{\Theta_{\text{rot}}}.
\]

However, the options provided do not explicitly include \( \sigma \). Among the given choices, the closest match to the leading term \( \frac{T}{\Theta_{\text{rot}}} \) is:

\[
q_{\text{rot}} = \frac{T}{\Theta_{\text{rot}}}.
\]

This corresponds to **option I**. While the symmetry number \( \sigma \) is important in the full expression, the question focuses on the high-temperature approximation, and the leading term is \( \frac{T}{\Theta_{\text{rot}}} \).

**Answer: I**
