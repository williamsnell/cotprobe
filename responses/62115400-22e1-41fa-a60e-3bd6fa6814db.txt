Okay, so I've got this accounting problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked.

The question is about estimating the final inventory for Firestone's Clothing Store as of August 31. They've given me some starting data: the August 1 inventory was $2,300. During August, they bought new merchandise totaling $1,125, and their sales were $3,485. The margin on sales is 18%. I need to pick the correct final inventory from the options A to J.

Hmm, let's break this down. I remember that in retail, the cost of goods sold (COGS) is related to the sales and the gross margin. The formula for margin is usually (Sales - COGS) / Sales = Margin. But wait, sometimes it's expressed as a percentage of sales. So if the margin is 18%, that means for every dollar in sales, the profit is 18 cents, so the COGS would be 82% of sales.

Wait, is that right? Let me think. If the margin is 18%, that's the profit as a percentage of sales. So Profit = Sales × Margin. Then COGS would be Sales minus Profit, which is Sales × (1 - Margin). So in this case, COGS would be 82% of sales.

So first, I'll calculate the cost of goods sold for August. Sales were $3,485, and the margin is 18%, so the profit is 3,485 × 0.18. Let me compute that: 3,485 × 0.18. Let's see, 3,000 × 0.18 is 540, 485 × 0.18 is approximately 87.3, so total profit is about $627.3. Therefore, COGS is 3,485 - 627.3, which is 2,857.7. So COGS is $2,857.70.

Now, I need to figure out the ending inventory. I remember the formula: Ending Inventory = Beginning Inventory + Purchases - COGS. Let's plug in the numbers.

Beginning Inventory is $2,300. Purchases are $1,125. So together, that's 2,300 + 1,125 = $3,425. Then subtract COGS, which is $2,857.70. So 3,425 minus 2,857.70. Let me do that subtraction: 3,425 - 2,857.70. 3,425 minus 2,800 is 625, then minus 57.70 is 567.30. So the ending inventory should be $567.30.

Looking at the options, option B is $567.30. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with the margin: 18% of 3,485 is indeed 627.3, so COGS is 3,485 - 627.3 = 2,857.7. Then, adding the beginning inventory and purchases: 2,300 + 1,125 = 3,425. Subtracting COGS: 3,425 - 2,857.7 = 567.3. Yep, that's correct. So the final inventory is $567.30, which is option B.

The final inventory is calculated by adding the beginning inventory and purchases, then subtracting the cost of goods sold. The cost of goods sold is determined using the given sales and margin percentage. After performing the calculations, the final inventory is $567.30.

Answer: B
