Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem where a solid is cut out of a sphere of radius 2 by two parallel planes, each 1 unit from the center. I need to find the volume of this solid, and the options are given from A to J.

Hmm, let me visualize this. The sphere has radius 2, so its center is at some point, and two parallel planes are cutting through it, each 1 unit away from the center. That means the distance between the two planes is 2 units because they're both 1 unit from the center on opposite sides.

Wait, no. If each plane is 1 unit from the center, then the distance between them is 2 units. So the solid that's cut out would be like a cylindrical section between two parallel planes, but in a sphere. Or maybe it's a spherical segment.

I think in a sphere, when you cut with two parallel planes, the volume between them is called a spherical segment. So I need to find the volume of that segment.

The formula for the volume of a spherical segment is given by (πh³)/(3) + (πh(3r² - h²))/6, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's better to use the method of integrating to find the volume.

Wait, another approach is to calculate the volume of the portion between the two planes. Since the sphere is symmetric, maybe I can find the volume of the part from the center to one plane and then double it, but wait, no, because the planes are on both sides.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The sphere has radius 2, so the center is at 0. The two planes are each 1 unit from the center, so one is at z=1 and the other at z=-1, assuming the planes are perpendicular to the z-axis.

Wait, no, the problem says each is 1 unit from the center, so they could be on the same side, but that doesn't make sense because then the distance between them would be zero. Wait, no, probably they're on opposite sides, so one is at z=1 and the other at z=-1, making the distance between them 2 units.

So the solid is the part of the sphere between z=-1 and z=1. So to find the volume, I can set up an integral using the method of disks or washers.

The equation of the sphere is x² + y² + z² = (2)² =4. So solving for x² + y² = 4 - z².

If I take cross-sections perpendicular to the z-axis, each cross-section at height z is a circle with radius sqrt(4 - z²). The area of each disk is π*(4 - z²).

So the volume would be the integral from z=-1 to z=1 of π*(4 - z²) dz.

Let me compute that:

Integral of π*(4 - z²) dz from -1 to 1.

First, integrate term by term:

Integral of 4 dz is 4z.

Integral of z² dz is (z³)/3.

So the integral becomes π [4z - (z³)/3] evaluated from -1 to 1.

Calculating at z=1: 4(1) - (1³)/3 = 4 - 1/3 = 12/3 - 1/3 = 11/3.

At z=-1: 4(-1) - (-1)³/3 = -4 - (-1/3) = -4 + 1/3 = (-12/3 + 1/3) = -11/3.

So the difference is [11/3] - [(-11/3)] = 11/3 + 11/3 = 22/3.

Multiply by π: 22π/3. So that's the volume.

Wait, but wait. Let me check if this is correct. Alternatively, maybe I should double-check the integral setup.

Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the volume of the portion of the sphere between z=-1 and z=1, which is a thick slice. The integral method seems correct.

Wait, but another approach is to use the formula for the volume of a spherical segment (or spherical cap). The formula for the volume of a spherical cap is (πh²(3r - h))/3, where h is the height of the cap and r is the radius of the sphere.

In this case, since the planes are 1 unit from the center in both directions, each cap has a height h=1 (from the center to the plane). But since there are two such caps, maybe I can compute the volume of one cap and multiply by two and subtract from the total sphere volume.

Wait, no, because the solid we're considering is the part between the two planes, which is the sphere minus the two caps. So the volume would be the volume of the sphere minus two times the volume of each cap.

The sphere's volume is (4/3)πr³ = (4/3)π(8) = 32π/3.

Each cap has height h=1. So the volume of one cap is (πh²(3r - h))/3 = π(1)^2*(3*2 -1)/3 = π*(5)/3 = 5π/3.

So two caps would be 2*(5π/3) = 10π/3.

Then the volume between the two planes would be sphere volume minus two caps: 32π/3 - 10π/3 = 22π/3.

Which matches the integral result. So the answer should be 22π/3, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the formula for the spherical cap. The formula is correct? Yes, the volume of a spherical cap is (πh²(3r - h))/3.

Alternatively, sometimes h is measured from the base of the cap to the top, which in this case is 1 unit from the center, so h=1, which is correct.

So yes, 22π/3 is the correct volume. So the answer is option A.

The solid is the portion of the sphere between two parallel planes 1 unit from the center. Using the integral method, the volume is found by integrating the area of circular cross-sections from z=-1 to z=1, resulting in 22π/3. Using the spherical cap formula, the volume is the sphere's volume minus twice the volume of each cap, also yielding 22π/3.
