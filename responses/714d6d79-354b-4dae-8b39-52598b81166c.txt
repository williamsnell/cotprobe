Question:

A large man with red hair robbed a liquor store. Thereafter, a defendant was arrested and charged with the armed robbery. At the defendant's trial, several eyewitnesses testified that they had seen a large redheaded man pull out a gun and rob the owner of the liquor store. The defendant appeared at trial with a shaven head. The prosecution calls a corrections officer to testify that the defendant had red hair when he was first brought to jail. The defendant's counsel objects. The trial judge should rule the correction officer's testimony

Options:

A: inadmissible, because the corrections officer was not present at the scene of the crime.
B: inadmissible, because it is irrelevant to the case.
C: inadmissible, because it is opinion testimony.
D: admissible as a character evidence.
E: admissible as a prior identification.
F: admissible, as it is a part of the arresting officer's routine report.
G: admissible, as it is a part of the chain of evidence in the case.
H: inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.
I: admissible, for the limited purpose of clarifying the discrepancy in the witnesses' testimony.
J: inadmissible, as it is prejudicial against the defendant.

Alright, let's try to work through this problem. Okay, so the scenario is that a large red-haired man robbed a liquor store, and the defendant was arrested and charged with the robbery. At the trial, several eyewitnesses testified that they saw a large redheaded man with a gun, robbing the store owner. But when the defendant appeared in court, he had a shaven head—so he wasn't redheaded anymore. 

The prosecution then called a corrections officer to testify that when the defendant was first brought to jail, he had red hair. The defense counsel objected, and the question is about whether the judge should allow this testimony or not. The options are A to J, each giving a reason for admissibility or inadmissibility.

First, I need to figure out what the issue is here. The defendant is arguing that he's innocent because the red hair is a key identifying feature, but at trial, he's shaved. The prosecution wants to bring in evidence that when he was arrested, he had red hair. So this is probably to show that the defendant fits the description of the robber.

Now, considering evidence law, what's the problem here? The corrections officer is testifying about the defendant's hair color when he was first brought in. The defense is objecting, so I need to see why.

Option A says it's inadmissible because the officer wasn't present at the crime scene. Well, that might be true, but it doesn't necessarily make the testimony inadmissible. The officer can testify about what he observed when he saw the defendant upon arrival. Presence at the scene isn't required if the testimony is about a fact within his personal knowledge.

Option B says it's irrelevant. Is the defendant's hair color relevant? Yes, because the eyewitnesses described the robber as having red hair. If the defendant had red hair when arrested, it supports the identification. So it's relevant.

Option C is about opinion testimony. The officer is just stating a fact—what the defendant's hair color was. That's not an opinion, so this option doesn't apply.

Option D suggests it's admissible as character evidence. Wait, character evidence is about a person's traits, but here it's about a physical characteristic at a specific time. It's more about identification, not character. So D might not be correct.

Option E says it's a prior identification. That doesn't seem right because the officer's testimony isn't about identifying the defendant from a lineup or anything; it's about his appearance upon arrest.

Option F mentions it's part of the arresting officer's routine report. If it's part of the report, it might be hearsay unless it's an exception like business records. But the officer is testifying based on his own observations, so it's not necessarily hearsay because he's testifying about what he saw, not reading from a report. Or maybe it's within a routine business record exception. But this option is a bit unclear.

Option G says it's part of the chain of evidence. That usually refers to things like custody of evidence, like how a piece of evidence was handled and stored. The hair color doesn't seem to be part of that chain, so G might not be right.

Option H says it's inadmissible as hearsay not within an exception. Wait, the officer is testifying about what he saw, which is firsthand knowledge. So it's not hearsay because the officer is the declarant and the statement is based on personal knowledge. So H is incorrect.

Option I suggests it's admissible to clarify a discrepancy. The eyewitnesses described a red-haired man, but the defendant now has a shaven head. The prosecution is trying to show that he did have red hair when arrested, which would explain the discrepancy. So this testimony could help clarify why the defendant's appearance is different now. So I think I is a good option.

Option J says it's inadmissible as prejudicial. Well, if it's relevant and not unduly prejudicial, it should be allowed. It's not like the testimony is introducing bad character or anything; it's just a fact to support identification. So J is probably wrong.

So putting it together, the testimony is relevant (so B is wrong), not hearsay (so H is wrong), and it's being used to explain a discrepancy in the evidence, which makes I the correct option.

The trial judge should rule the correction officer's testimony as admissible for the limited purpose of clarifying the discrepancy in the witnesses' testimony. The testimony is relevant because it supports the identification of the defendant as the perpetrator, and it does not fall under hearsay or other inadmissible categories. 

Answer: I
