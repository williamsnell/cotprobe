Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about residual in a standard regression model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on regression concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that residuals are related to the differences between actual and predicted values. In regression analysis, when you fit a model, you predict a value y-hat based on the independent variables. The residual is what's left after the model explains as much as it can of the variation in the dependent variable y.

So, the residual should be the difference between the actual y and the predicted y-hat. Let me check the options. Option A says exactly that: the difference between y and y-hat. That sounds right. 

Option B mentions the square of that difference. Oh, wait, that's related to residuals squared, which I think is used in calculating the sum of squared errors (SSE). So B is probably not the residual itself but part of the calculation of it.

Option C talks about the square of the difference between y-hat and the mean y-bar. That sounds familiar too. I think that's part of the decomposition in regression, where the total sum of squares is the sum of the regression sum of squares and the residual sum of squares. So, each residual is y - y-hat, but when you square them, maybe that's where the sum of squares comes in. But the question is about the residual itself, not the squared version.

Option D is the difference between y-hat and y-bar. That seems like it's related to the explained part of the variation, not the residual. Because in regression, the model explains how much y deviates from its mean. So D is probably the predicted component, not the residual.

Option E is the sum of y and y-hat. That doesn't make sense because residuals are about the difference, not the sum. Plus, sum would be a big number, while residuals are individual differences.

Option F mentions the standard deviation s and y-hat. I'm not sure what s refers to here. Maybe the standard error? Not sure, but I don't think that's related to the definition of a residual.

Option G is the difference between y and y-bar, which is the mean. That's the basic deviation from the mean, which is used in calculating variance and standard deviation, but that's not the residual. The residual is specifically about the model's prediction versus actual.

Option H compares y and the median m. I don't recall residuals being related to medians. It's all about means in regression, so H is probably incorrect.

Option I is the square root of the difference between y and y-hat. That's the absolute value, maybe? Because square root of (y - y-hat)^2 would be the absolute value. But residuals are usually just the signed differences, not absolute values. So I don't think this is right either.

Putting it all together, the residual is y minus y-hat, which is option A. Options B and C are about squared terms, which relate to sums of squares, not the residual itself. D is about the explained part, and the others don't fit the definition.

The residual in a standard regression model is defined as the difference between the actual observed value \( y \) and the predicted or fitted value \( \hat{y} \). This represents the portion of the data that the model does not explain. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Correct, as it directly states the difference between \( y \) and \( \hat{y} \).
- **B**: Incorrect, as it refers to the squared difference, which is related to the sum of squared errors but not the residual itself.
- **C**: Incorrect, as it involves the mean, which relates to explained variation, not residuals.
- **D**: Incorrect, as it describes the explained part of the variation, not the residual.
- **E**: Incorrect, as it involves the sum of \( y \) and \( \hat{y} \), which is unrelated to residuals.
- **F**: Incorrect, as it introduces the standard deviation, which is not part of the residual definition.
- **G**: Incorrect, as it refers to deviation from the mean, not residuals.
- **H**: Incorrect, as it involves the median, which is irrelevant to residuals.
- **I**: Incorrect, as it refers to the square root of the difference, which is not how residuals are defined.

Thus, the correct answer is **A**.

Answer: A
