Alright, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me take it step by step because I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts. 

The question says that a gas has a constant volume specific heat equal to (4.52 + 0.00737T) Btu/lbm-°F. It's initially at 175°F, and heat is added in a constant volume process until the temperature rises to 200°F. I need to calculate the change in entropy for this process.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that entropy change for a constant volume process can be calculated using the formula:

ΔS = ∫(from T1 to T2) (cv / T) dT

Since the process is at constant volume, the specific heat is cv, and the integral becomes the integral of cv divided by temperature with respect to temperature, from the initial temperature T1 to the final temperature T2.

Given that cv is a function of temperature, which varies as (4.52 + 0.00737T), I can't just use a simple formula. Instead, I need to integrate this function from T1 to T2.

Let me write down the integral:

ΔS = ∫(T1 to T2) (4.52 + 0.00737T) / T dT

I can split this into two separate integrals:

ΔS = ∫(T1 to T2) 4.52/T dT + ∫(T1 to T2) 0.00737 dT

Let me compute these one by one.

First integral: ∫(4.52 / T) dT. The integral of 1/T is ln(T), so this becomes 4.52 * ln(T) evaluated from T1 to T2.

Second integral: ∫0.00737 dT. Since 0.00737 is a constant, the integral is 0.00737 * (T2 - T1).

So putting it all together:

ΔS = 4.52 * [ln(T2) - ln(T1)] + 0.00737 * (T2 - T1)

Alternatively, the first part can be written as 4.52 * ln(T2/T1) because ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b).

Now, plugging in the values. T1 is 175°F, and T2 is 200°F. Let me compute each part.

First, calculate the natural logarithm part:

ln(200/175) = ln(1.142857)

I can approximate this value. I know that ln(1) is 0, ln(e)=1, and e is about 2.718. But for 1.142857, I might need to compute it.

Alternatively, I can use a calculator approach, but since I'm trying to think through, perhaps I'll remember that ln(1.14) is approximately 0.1335. Let me check that with more precision. Alternatively, I can compute it using Taylor series or logarithm properties.

Wait, maybe I should just calculate it numerically. Let me see:

200 divided by 175 is approximately 1.142857.

So ln(1.142857) ≈ 0.1335.

I'll go with that for now, but maybe I should double-check. Alternatively, using a calculator, I can think that ln(1.142857) is approximately 0.1335. Let's proceed.

Now, the first part is 4.52 multiplied by 0.1335.

4.52 * 0.1335 ≈ Let's compute that.

4 * 0.1335 is 0.534, and 0.52 * 0.1335 is approximately 0.06942. Adding those together, 0.534 + 0.06942 ≈ 0.60342.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because 4.52 * 0.1335 would be around 4.52 * 0.1335 = 

Wait, perhaps I should compute 4.52 * 0.1335 more accurately.

4.52 * 0.1 = 0.452

4.52 * 0.03 = 0.1356

4.52 * 0.0035 ≈ 0.01582

Adding those together: 0.452 + 0.1356 = 0.5876, plus 0.01582 gives ≈ 0.60342.

So the first term is approximately 0.60342 Btu/lbm.

Now, the second integral: 0.00737 multiplied by (200 - 175).

200 - 175 = 25.

So 0.00737 * 25 = 0.18425.

Adding both terms together:

ΔS = 0.60342 + 0.18425 ≈ 0.78767 Btu/lbm.

Wait, that doesn't match any of the options given. The options are all much lower, like 0.1843, 0.00737, etc. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units or the formula. Let me double-check the formula for entropy change at constant volume.

Yes, the formula is correct: ΔS = ∫(cv / T) dT from T1 to T2.

Wait, but wait a minute. Specific heat is in Btu/lbm-°F, and temperature is in °F. But when we integrate (cv / T), the units would be (Btu/lbm-°F) / °F * dT (°F). So the units would be (Btu/lbm-°F) * (°F) / °F) → Btu/lbm. Wait, no, let me think again.

Wait, cv is in Btu/lbm-°F. So when we have cv / T, the units would be (Btu/lbm-°F) / °F, which is (Btu/lbm) * (1/(°F^2)). Hmm, that seems off. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the integral.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Because when you integrate (cv / T) dT, the units should be Btu/lbm.

Wait, let me check the units:

cv is in Btu/(lbm·°F), T is in °F, so (cv / T) is (Btu/(lbm·°F)) / °F) = Btu/(lbm·°F²). Then dT is in °F, so when you multiply, it becomes (Btu/(lbm·°F²)) * °F) = Btu/(lbm·°F). That can't be right because entropy should be in Btu/lbm.

Wait, I think I must have made a mistake in the units. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is correct but I'm using the wrong approach.

Wait, perhaps in the formula, the specific heat is in consistent units. Maybe I should convert the temperatures from °F to an absolute scale, like Rankine, since entropy calculations typically use absolute temperatures.

Ah, yes! That's probably where I went wrong. I didn't convert the temperatures to absolute units. Because entropy change involves absolute temperatures, not relative scales like °F. So I need to convert T1 and T2 to Rankine.

Rankine is °F + 459.67. So T1 in Rankine is 175 + 459.67 = 634.67 °R, and T2 is 200 + 459.67 = 659.67 °R.

So the integral should be:

ΔS = ∫(T1 to T2) (4.52 + 0.00737T) / T dT

But wait, the T here is in Rankine, so I need to use absolute temperature.

Let me correct that. So the temperatures are in Rankine, T = °F + 459.67.

So now, I should recalculate the integral with T in Rankine.

So, T1 = 634.67, T2 = 659.67.

So, the first integral is 4.52 * ln(T2 / T1), and the second integral is 0.00737 * (T2 - T1).

Let me compute each part again.

First, calculate T2 / T1:

659.67 / 634.67 ≈ Let me see: 634.67 is approx 635, 659.67 is approx 660.

660 / 635 ≈ 1.04.

Wait, let me compute more accurately:

634.67 * 1.04 = 634.67 + (634.67 * 0.04) = 634.67 + 25.3868 ≈ 660.0568.

Which is very close to 659.67, so 659.67 / 634.67 is about 1.04 (actually a bit less than that, but let's compute it accurately).

Let me compute 659.67 / 634.67:

634.67 * 1.04 = 634.67 + (634.67 * 0.04) = 634.67 + 25.3868 = 660.0568.

But T2 is 659.67, which is slightly less than 660.0568, so the ratio is approximately 1.04 - a little less.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it as:

659.67 ÷ 634.67 = ?

Let me compute this using division.

So 634.67 * 1.04 = 660.0568, as above.

But 659.67 is 0.3868 less than 660.0568. So the ratio is 1.04 - (0.3868 / 634.67) ≈ 1.04 - 0.000609 ≈ 1.0394.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute it directly.

Alternatively, I can compute ln(659.67 / 634.67).

Let me calculate 659.67 ÷ 634.67.

634.67 goes into 659.67 once, with a remainder.

659.67 - 634.67 = 25.

So 25 / 634.67 ≈ 0.0394.

So the ratio is approximately 1.0394.

So ln(1.0394) ≈ ?

I know that ln(1.04) is approximately 0.03922. Let me check with more precision.

Using the Taylor series for ln(x) around x=1: ln(1+x) ≈ x - x²/2 + x³/3 - x^4/4 + ...

Here, x = 0.0394.

So ln(1.0394) ≈ 0.0394 - (0.0394)^2 / 2 + (0.0394)^3 /3 - ...

Compute each term:

0.0394 ≈ 0.0394

(0.0394)^2 = 0.001552, divided by 2 is 0.000776.

(0.0394)^3 ≈ 0.0000612, divided by 3 is 0.0000204.

So ln(1.0394) ≈ 0.0394 - 0.000776 + 0.0000204 ≈ 0.0386444.

So approximately 0.03864.

So the first part is 4.52 * 0.03864 ≈ Let's compute that.

4.52 * 0.03 = 0.1356

4.52 * 0.00864 ≈ Let's see: 4 * 0.00864 = 0.03456, 0.52 * 0.00864 ≈ 0.0045. So total ≈ 0.03456 + 0.0045 = 0.03906.

Adding to 0.1356: 0.1356 + 0.03906 ≈ 0.17466.

So first term ≈ 0.17466 Btu/lbm.

Now, the second integral: 0.00737 * (T2 - T1) in Rankine.

T2 - T1 = 659.67 - 634.67 = 25. So the same as before.

So 0.00737 * 25 = 0.18425 Btu/lbm.

Adding both terms together: 0.17466 + 0.18425 ≈ 0.35891 Btu/lbm.

Looking at the options, option E is 0.3588 Btu/lbm, which matches closely.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because I'm seeing a discrepancy. Earlier, without converting to Rankine, I got around 0.787, which wasn't an option. But after converting, I got 0.3589, which is option E.

Wait, but let me confirm the second integral again. The specific heat term is 0.00737, which is in Btu/lbm-°F, and when we multiply by (T2 - T1) in °F, the units would be Btu/lbm, which is correct.

Wait, but in the integral, the second part is ∫(0.00737) dT, so the units would be 0.00737 (Btu/lbm-°F) * (°F) → Btu/lbm, which is correct.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the second integral. Because when the specific heat is constant, the entropy change is ∫(cv / T) dT. But when cv is a function of T, we can split it into the two parts as I did.

Wait, another way to look at it: the integral becomes ∫cv dT / T. So if cv is given as (4.52 + 0.00737T), then yes, splitting into two integrals is correct.

Wait, but when I converted T to Rankine, I used T in Rankine for the integral, which is correct because entropy uses absolute temperature.

So, putting it all together, the entropy change is approximately 0.17466 + 0.18425 = 0.35891 Btu/lbm, which is very close to option E: 0.3588 Btu/lbm.

So the correct answer should be E.
</think>

To calculate the change in entropy for the given constant volume process, we use the formula:

ΔS = ∫(T₁ to T₂) (cv / T) dT

Given cv = (4.52 + 0.00737T) Btu/lbm-°F, we split the integral:

ΔS = ∫(4.52 / T) dT + ∫(0.00737) dT

The first integral becomes 4.52 * ln(T₂/T₁), and the second is 0.00737 * (T₂ - T₁). Converting temperatures to Rankine (°F + 459.67), we have T₁ = 634.67 °R and T₂ = 659.67 °R.

1. Compute ln(659.67 / 634.67) ≈ ln(1.0394) ≈ 0.03864.
   - 4.52 * 0.03864 ≈ 0.17466 Btu/lbm.

2. Compute 0.00737 * (659.67 - 634.67) = 0.00737 * 25 ≈ 0.18425 Btu/lbm.

Adding both parts: 0.17466 + 0.18425 ≈ 0.35891 Btu/lbm, which matches option E.

Answer: E
