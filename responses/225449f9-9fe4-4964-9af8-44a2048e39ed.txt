Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the theoretical density of sodium, which crystallizes in a body-centered cubic (BCC) structure. The lattice parameter 'a' is given as 4.24 Ångströms. Hmm, I remember that density calculations involve the number of atoms in the unit cell, the volume of the unit cell, and the molar mass. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I should recall the formula for density. I think it's density (d) equals (Z * M) divided by (N_A * a³), where Z is the number of atoms per unit cell, M is the molar mass, N_A is Avogadro's number, and a is the lattice parameter.

Sodium has a BCC structure. In a BCC unit cell, there are atoms at each corner and one in the center. Each corner atom contributes 1/8th to the unit cell, and there are 8 corners, so that's 8*(1/8) = 1 atom from the corners. Plus the one in the center makes a total of 2 atoms per unit cell. So Z is 2.

Next, the molar mass of sodium (Na) is about 23 grams per mole, right? So M = 23 g/mol.

Avogadro's number, N_A, is 6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol.

Now, the lattice parameter a is given as 4.24 Å. But wait, that's in Ångströms, and I need to convert that to meters because density is in kg/m³. 1 Å is 1e-10 meters, so 4.24 Å is 4.24e-10 meters.

The volume of the unit cell is a³. So let's compute that. (4.24e-10 m)^3. Let me calculate that. 4.24 cubed is approximately 75.95 (since 4^3 is 64, 4.24 is a bit more, so around 75.95). So 75.95e-30 m³, which is 7.595e-29 m³.

Now, plug everything into the formula:

d = (Z * M) / (N_A * a³)

So Z is 2, M is 0.023 kg/mol (since 23g = 0.023 kg), N_A is 6.022e23, and a³ is 7.595e-29.

Putting numbers in:

d = (2 * 0.023 kg/mol) / (6.022e23 atoms/mol * 7.595e-29 m³/atom)

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The units: M is in kg/mol, N_A is atoms/mol, and a³ is m³. So the denominator is (atoms/mol * m³), which would be m³·atoms/mol. But I'm not sure about the units here; perhaps better to proceed numerically.

Compute numerator: 2 * 0.023 = 0.046 kg/mol.

Denominator: 6.022e23 * 7.595e-29. Let's compute that. 6.022e23 * 7.595e-29 = (6.022 * 7.595) * 1e(23-29) = approximately 45.72 * 1e-6 = 4.572e-5.

So denominator is 4.572e-5 m³·atoms/mol? Wait, but I'm not sure about the units. Maybe I should just compute the numerical value.

So d = 0.046 / (4.572e-5) ≈ 0.046 / 0.00004572 ≈ let's calculate that.

0.046 divided by 0.00004572. Let me compute it as 46e-3 / 4.572e-5. That's 46e-3 / 4.572e-5 = (46 / 4.572) * (1e-3 / 1e-5) ) = approximately 10.06 * 100 = 1006 kg/m³.

Wait, that can't be right because sodium's density is known to be around 0.97 g/cm³, which is 970 kg/m³. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me check the calculation again. Let me compute the denominator: 6.022e23 * 7.595e-29.

6.022e23 *7.595e-29 = (6.022 *7.595) * 1e(23-29) = 45.72 * 1e-6 = 4.572e-5.

So denominator is 4.572e-5.

Numerator is 0.046.

So 0.046 / 4.572e-5 = 0.046 / 0.00004572.

Let me compute 0.046 divided by 0.00004572. Let's convert both to the same exponent. 0.046 is 4.6e-2, 0.00004572 is 4.572e-5.

So 4.6e-2 / 4.572e-5 = (4.6 /4.572) * 1e( -2 +5 ) = (approx 1.006) * 1e3 = 1006 kg/m³.

Wait, but I thought sodium's density is about 0.97 g/cm³, which is 970 kg/m³. So why is my calculation giving 1006? Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Let me check the unit conversions again. Oh wait, the lattice parameter was given as 4.24 Å, which is 4.24e-10 meters. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me double-check the formula for density in a BCC structure.

In BCC, each unit cell has 2 atoms. So Z=2.

Density d = (Z*M)/(N_A * a³).

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the molar mass. Sodium's molar mass is 23 g/mol, which is 0.023 kg/mol. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the a³. Let me compute a³ again.

a = 4.24 Å = 4.24e-10 m.

a³ = (4.24e-10)^3 = 4.24^3 * (1e-10)^3 = 75.95 * 1e-30 = 7.595e-29 m³. Correct.

So 6.022e23 *7.595e-29 = 6.022e23 *7.595e-29 = (6.022 *7.595) * 1e(23-29) = 45.72 *1e-6 = 4.572e-5.

So denominator is 4.572e-5 (unit is m³·atoms/mol? Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of per mole.)

Wait, perhaps I should think of the denominator as (N_A * a³) which is atoms/mol * m³. So the units would be (atoms/mol * m³), and the numerator is kg/mol, so the overall units would be kg/(m³ * atoms) * mol/(atoms/mol) → kg/m³.

Wait, perhaps that's getting too complicated. Let me proceed with the numbers.

So d = (2 * 0.023) / (6.022e23 *7.595e-29) 

Wait, perhaps I should compute it as:

(2 * 0.023 kg/mol) / (6.022e23 atoms/mol *7.595e-29 m³/atom)

Wait, no, the unit would be kg/mol divided by (atoms/mol * m³/atom) → kg/mol * mol/(atoms * m³) * atoms → kg/(m³). Because atoms cancel out.

So the calculation is:

d = (0.046 kg/mol) / (6.022e23 atoms/mol *7.595e-29 m³/atom)

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the denominator as 6.022e23 *7.595e-29 = 6.022e23 *7.595e-29 = let me compute 6.022 *7.595 first.

6 *7.595 is 45.57, 0.022 *7.595 is about 0.167, so total about 45.737. So 45.737e(23-29) = 45.737e-6 = 4.5737e-5.

So denominator is 4.5737e-5 (units are m³·atoms/mol).

Wait, but the numerator is 0.046 kg/mol. So when I divide, it's (0.046 kg/mol) / (4.5737e-5 m³·atoms/mol) → kg/(m³·atoms) * mol/(mol) → kg/(m³·atoms) * atoms (since mol cancels) → kg/m³.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as (kg/mol) / (m³/atom * atoms/mol) → (kg/mol) / (m³) → kg/m³.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating the units. Let me proceed numerically.

So 0.046 divided by 4.5737e-5 is approximately 0.046 / 0.000045737 ≈ 1005.5 kg/m³. That's around 1006 kg/m³, which is about 1.006e3 kg/m³.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.97 ×10^3 kg/m³, which is 970 kg/m³. My calculation is giving about 1006, which is higher than that. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should check the exact value of 4.24^3. Let me compute 4.24 *4.24 = let's see. 4*4=16, 4*0.24=0.96, 0.24*4=0.96, 0.24^2=0.0576. So (4+0.24)^2 = 16 + 2*(4*0.24) +0.24² = 16 + 1.92 + 0.0576 = 17.9776. Now, multiply by 4.24 again: 17.9776 *4.24.

Let me compute 17 *4.24 = 72.08, 0.9776 *4.24 ≈ about 4.134. So total ≈72.08 +4.134=76.214. So a³ is approximately 76.214e-30 m³ =7.6214e-29 m³.

So denominator: 6.022e23 *7.6214e-29 = 6.022 *7.6214 = let's compute that.

6 *7.6214=45.7284, 0.022*7.6214≈0.1677. So total ≈45.7284 +0.1677=45.8961.

So 45.8961e-6 =4.5896e-5.

So denominator is 4.5896e-5.

Numerator is 0.046.

So d=0.046 /4.5896e-5 ≈ 0.046 /0.000045896 = approximately 1002 kg/m³.

Hmm, but the known density of sodium is about 0.97 g/cm³, which is 970 kg/m³. So why is my calculation giving 1002?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the molar mass. Sodium's molar mass is 22.99 g/mol, so 0.02299 kg/mol. Let me recalculate with that.

So Z=2, M=0.02299 kg/mol.

Numerator: 2 *0.02299=0.04598 kg/mol.

Denominator: same as before, 4.5896e-5.

So d=0.04598 /4.5896e-5 ≈ 0.04598 /0.000045896 ≈ let's compute that.

0.04598 /0.000045896 ≈ around 1001.8 kg/m³.

Hmm, that's still higher than 970. Maybe I made a mistake in the volume calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the volume correctly. Let me compute a^3 again accurately.

a =4.24 Å =4.24e-10 m.

a^3 = (4.24)^3 * (1e-10)^3.

4.24^3: 4^3=64, 0.24^3=0.013824, but more accurately, 4.24 *4.24=17.9776, then 17.9776 *4.24.

Let me compute that step by step.

17.9776 *4 =71.9104.

17.9776 *0.24 = let's compute 17.9776 *0.2=3.59552, and 17.9776 *0.04=0.719104. Adding those gives 3.59552+0.719104=4.314624.

So total a^3 =71.9104 +4.314624=76.225024 Å³.

Wait, but wait, that's in (Å)^3, right? Since a is in Å. So 76.225024 Å³. But 1 Å = 1e-10 m, so (1 Å)^3 =1e-30 m³. So a³=76.225024e-30 m³ =7.6225e-29 m³.

Now, denominator: N_A * a³ =6.022e23 *7.6225e-29 = let's compute 6.022 *7.6225 first.

6 *7.6225=45.735, 0.022 *7.6225≈0.1677. So total≈45.735 +0.1677=45.9027.

So 45.9027e(23-29) =45.9027e-6 =4.59027e-5.

Numerator: 2*0.02299=0.04598 kg/mol.

So d=0.04598 /4.59027e-5 ≈0.04598 /0.0000459027≈ let me compute that.

0.04598 /0.0000459027 ≈ approximately 1001.7 kg/m³.

Hmm, but that's still not matching the known value. Maybe I should check another source. Wait, I think the theoretical density of sodium is actually around 0.97 g/cm³, which is 970 kg/m³. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the number of atoms per unit cell correctly. Wait, in BCC, it's 2 atoms. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the molar mass. Let me confirm: Sodium has an atomic weight of approximately 22.99 g/mol, so 0.02299 kg/mol.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values. Let me compute the denominator again with more precise numbers.

Compute N_A * a³:

N_A=6.02214076e23 atoms/mol.

a=4.24e-10 m.

a³= (4.24e-10)^3 =4.24^3 *1e-30 =76.225 *1e-30 =7.6225e-29 m³.

So denominator: 6.02214076e23 *7.6225e-29.

Compute 6.02214076 *7.6225 = let's calculate:

6 *7.6225=45.735.

0.02214076 *7.6225≈ approximately 0.02214 *7.6225 ≈ 0.1688.

So total ≈45.735 +0.1688 =45.9038.

So denominator:45.9038e(23-29)=45.9038e-6 =4.59038e-5.

Now, numerator: 2 *0.02299 =0.04598 kg/mol.

So d=0.04598 /4.59038e-5 = 0.04598 /0.0000459038 ≈ let me compute this division.

0.04598 /0.0000459038 = approximately 1001.7 kg/m³.

This is still not matching the known value. Maybe I'm using the wrong structure? No, the question says BCC.

Wait, perhaps the lattice parameter is given in a different unit. Wait, 4.24 Å is correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the Avogadro's number. Let me check: 6.022e23 is correct.

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Compute 0.04598 /4.59038e-5.

= 0.04598 / 0.0000459038.

Let me write this as 4.598e-2 /4.59038e-5.

Which is (4.598 /4.59038) * 1e3.

4.598 /4.59038 ≈ approx 1.0017.

So 1.0017 *1e3=1001.7 kg/m³.

Hmm, so according to my calculation, it's about 1002 kg/m³, but the known value is around 970 kg/m³. So where is the mistake?

Wait a second, perhaps I'm confusing g/cm³ with kg/m³. Wait, 1 g/cm³ is 1000 kg/m³. Because 1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³, and 1 g is 0.001 kg. So 1 g/cm³ = 1000 kg/m³.

Wait, but sodium's density is 0.97 g/cm³, which would be 970 kg/m³. So my calculation is giving about 1002 kg/m³, which is higher than that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the a³ calculation. Let me compute a³ again.

a=4.24e-10 m.

a³= (4.24)^3 * (1e-10)^3.

4.24^3: 4.24 *4.24=17.9776. Then 17.9776 *4.24:

17.9776 *4 =71.9104.

17.9776 *0.24=4.314624.

Total=71.9104 +4.314624=76.225024.

So a³=76.225024e-30 m³ =7.6225024e-29 m³.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the formula. Let me think again: d = (Z * M) / (N_A * a³).

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the molar mass in grams instead of kilograms. Wait, no, because the formula requires M in kg/mol for the density to come out in kg/m³.

Wait, let me try using grams for M and see what happens. Wait, no, that would give the density in g/cm³.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the density in g/cm³ and then convert.

Let me try that approach.

So, M=22.99 g/mol.

Z=2.

a=4.24 Å=4.24e-8 cm (because 1 Å=1e-8 cm).

a³= (4.24e-8 cm)^3 =76.225e-24 cm³=7.6225e-23 cm³.

Now, density d= (Z * M) / (N_A * a³).

So d= (2 *22.99 g/mol) / (6.022e23 atoms/mol *7.6225e-23 cm³/atom).

Wait, denominator: 6.022e23 *7.6225e-23 = (6.022 *7.6225) *1e0 = approximately 45.9038.

So denominator is 45.9038 cm³·atoms/mol.

Numerator: 2*22.99=45.98 g/mol.

So d=45.98 /45.9038 ≈1.0017 g/cm³.

Wait, that's about 1.0017 g/cm³, which is 1001.7 kg/m³. But sodium's density is 0.97 g/cm³. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation. Let me check with more precise numbers.

Wait, I think I might have an error in the a conversion. Let me make sure:

1 Å = 1e-8 cm, so 4.24 Å =4.24e-8 cm.

a³= (4.24e-8)^3 = (4.24)^3 * (1e-8)^3 =76.225e-24 cm³ =7.6225e-23 cm³.

Yes, correct.

So with M=22.99 g/mol,

d= (2 *22.99)/(6.022e23 *7.6225e-23) g/cm³.

Compute denominator: 6.022e23 *7.6225e-23 =6.022 *7.6225 =45.9038.

So d=45.98 /45.9038 ≈1.0017 g/cm³, which is about 1002 kg/m³.

But this contradicts the known value. Perhaps the given lattice parameter is incorrect, or perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, maybe I should check the number of atoms in the BCC structure again. Yes, it's 2 atoms. Correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different approach. Let me compute the volume per atom and then find the density.

In BCC, each atom occupies a certain volume. The unit cell has 2 atoms, so the volume per atom is a³/2.

The mass per atom is M/(N_A).

So density is (mass per atom)/(volume per atom) = (M/(N_A)) / (a³/2) = (2M)/(N_A a³).

Which is the same as the formula I used before.

Hmm, perhaps I should look up the exact value of the lattice parameter for sodium. Wait, I think the lattice parameter for Na is around 4.24 Å, which matches the problem's data. So my calculation should be correct.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the Avogadro's number. Let me confirm N_A is 6.022e23.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the calculation with more precise numbers.

Let me compute 6.022e23 *7.6225e-29:

6.022e23 *7.6225e-29 = (6.022 *7.6225) *1e(23-29) =45.9038 *1e-6=4.59038e-5.

So denominator is 4.59038e-5.

Numerator:0.04598 kg/mol.

So 0.04598 /4.59038e-5 = approximately 1001.7 kg/m³.

Hmm, but according to my notes, sodium's density is about 0.97 g/cm³, which is 970 kg/m³. So why is my calculation giving a higher value?

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for Avogadro's number, like 6.02e23. Let me try that.

If N_A=6.02e23,

Denominator:6.02e23 *7.6225e-29 =6.02 *7.6225=45.875 *1e-6=4.5875e-5.

Numerator:0.04598.

So 0.04598 /4.5875e-5 ≈ 0.04598 /0.000045875≈1002.3 kg/m³.

Still around the same.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to round to the nearest option. The options are:

A:2.50e3

B:0.97e3

C:0.50e3

D:1.20e3

E:1.75e3

F:2.00e3

G:0.80e3

H:1.00e3

I:1.50e3

J:0.65e3

So my calculation is about 1002 kg/m³, which is close to option B (0.97e3) but a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of atoms.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem uses the atomic weight as 23 instead of 22.99. Let me try that.

M=23 g/mol=0.023 kg/mol.

So numerator:2 *0.023=0.046 kg/mol.

Denominator:4.59038e-5.

d=0.046 /4.59038e-5 ≈1002.16 kg/m³.

Still around 1002.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it using cm³ and g, then convert to kg/m³.

Let me try that.

a=4.24 Å=4.24e-8 cm.

a³=76.225e-24 cm³=7.6225e-23 cm³.

M=22.99 g/mol.

d=(2 *22.99) / (6.022e23 *7.6225e-23) g/cm³.

Denominator:6.022e23 *7.6225e-23=45.9038.

Numerator:45.98.

d=45.98 /45.9038≈1.0017 g/cm³=1001.7 kg/m³.

Again, same result.

Wait, maybe the problem expects me to use a different approach, like the atomic radius. Wait, no, the problem gives the lattice parameter, so I should proceed with that.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. The closest option to my answer is H:1.00e3 kg/m³, which is 1000 kg/m³. But my calculation is 1002, which is closer to H.

But option B is 0.97e3, which is 970, which is the known value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the lattice parameter. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different number of atoms.

Wait, wait, wait. BCC structure has 2 atoms per unit cell, correct. So perhaps I didn't make a mistake there.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the atomic mass as 23 instead of 22.99. Let's try that.

M=23 g/mol=0.023 kg/mol.

Numerator:2 *0.023=0.046.

Denominator:6.022e23 *7.6225e-29=4.59038e-5.

d=0.046 /4.59038e-5=1002.16 kg/m³.

Still around 1002.

Wait, but the options don't have 1002. The closest is H:1.00e3. So perhaps the intended answer is H:1.00e3 kg/m³.

But I'm confused because I thought the correct density is around 970 kg/m³. Maybe the given lattice parameter is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the formula.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should compute the volume per mole instead of per unit cell. No, the formula is correct as I used it.

Wait, perhaps the error is that I forgot to convert g to kg. No, I did that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the density as grams per cm³ and see.

As before, I get about 1.0017 g/cm³, which is 1001.7 kg/m³.

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is 0.97e3 kg/m³, which is option B. But why is my calculation giving a higher value?

Wait, perhaps I should check if the lattice parameter is in a different unit. Oh wait, the problem states a=4.24 Å. So that's correct.

I think I've spent enough time on this. Based on my calculation, the density is approximately 1002 kg/m³, which is closest to option H:1.00 ×10^3 kg m^-3.

To calculate the theoretical density of sodium (Na) in a body-centered cubic (BCC) structure with a lattice parameter \( a = 4.24 \, \text{\AA} \), the following steps are performed:

1. **Number of Atoms per Unit Cell (\( Z \))**:  
   In a BCC structure, there are 2 atoms per unit cell.

2. **Molar Mass (\( M \))**:  
   The molar mass of sodium is \( M = 22.99 \, \text{g/mol} = 0.02299 \, \text{kg/mol} \).

3. **Avogadro's Number (\( N_A \))**:  
   \( N_A = 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{atoms/mol} \).

4. **Lattice Parameter (\( a \))**:  
   Convert \( a = 4.24 \, \text{\AA} \) to meters:  
   \( a = 4.24 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \).

5. **Volume of the Unit Cell (\( a^3 \))**:  
   \( a^3 = (4.24 \times 10^{-10})^3 = 7.6225 \times 10^{-29} \, \text{m}^3 \).

6. **Density Formula**:  
   The density is given by:  
   \[
   d = \frac{Z \cdot M}{N_A \cdot a^3}
   \]

7. **Substitute Values**:  
   \[
   d = \frac{2 \cdot 0.02299}{6.022 \times 10^{23} \cdot 7.6225 \times 10^{-29}}
   \]

8. **Simplify Denominator**:  
   \[
   N_A \cdot a^3 = 6.022 \times 10^{23} \cdot 7.6225 \times 10^{-29} = 4.59038 \times 10^{-5}
   \]

9. **Simplify Numerator**:  
   \[
   Z \cdot M = 2 \cdot 0.02299 = 0.04598 \, \text{kg/mol}
   \]

10. **Calculate Density**:  
    \[
    d = \frac{0.04598}{4.59038 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 1001.7 \, \text{kg/m}^3
    \]

11. **Comparison with Options**:  
    The calculated density is approximately \( 1002 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \), which is closest to option **H: \( 1.00 \times 10^3 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \)**.

Answer: H
