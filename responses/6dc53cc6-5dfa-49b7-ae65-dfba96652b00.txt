Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about why we can perform manual tasks like dressing or tying knots even when our eyes are closed. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, the question is asking about the principal organs involved in seeing, which are our eyes. But the twist is that we can do these manual tasks without vision. So, what other senses or receptors allow us to do that?

I remember that the body has various types of receptors besides vision. There's the gustatory (taste), auditory (hearing), olfactory (smell), and others. Let me list them out as per the options: Gustatory, Photoreceptors, Auditory, Proprioceptors, Thermoreceptors, Nociceptors, Mechanoreceptors, Chemoreceptors, Olfactory, Baroreceptors.

Wait, the question is about performing manual actions without seeing, so it's probably related to something that gives us information about our body's position or movement. Oh, right! Proprioception. That's the sense that tells us where our body parts are in space. It's why we can touch our nose with our eyes closed or put on clothes without looking.

Proprioceptors are the receptors responsible for this. They are found in our muscles, tendons, and joints. They provide feedback about body position, movement, and acceleration. So without vision, these receptors help us navigate and perform tasks.

Looking at the options, D is Proprioceptors. I think that's the correct answer. The other options don't fit as well. For example, Gustatory is taste, which isn't relevant here. Auditory is hearing, which might help if you're following a sound, but the question is about manual tasks without external cues. Thermoreceptors are for temperature, Nociceptors for pain, Mechanoreceptors for touch and pressure, Chemoreceptors for chemicals (like taste/smell), Olfactory for smell, and Baroreceptors for blood pressure, which isn't related.

So yeah, the answer should be D: Proprioceptors.

The ability to perform manual tasks without visual input, such as dressing or tying knots with closed eyes, relies on our sense of proprioception. Proprioceptors, located in muscles, tendons, and joints, provide the body with information about position, movement, and balance, enabling these tasks without vision. 

Answer: D
