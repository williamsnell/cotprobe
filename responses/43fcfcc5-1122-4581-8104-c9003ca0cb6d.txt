Okay, so I'm trying to solve this electrical engineering problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem is about a shunt motor. The motor has a rated voltage of 115 volts, and the armature resistance is 0.22 ohms. There's a voltage across the brush contacts of 2 volts. The question has two parts: (a) when the counteremf is 108 volts, what's the armature current? And (b) if the load increases so that the counteremf drops to 106 volts, what's the new armature current?

The options are letters A through J, each providing two current values for parts (a) and (b). I need to calculate both parts and then match them with the options.

First, I remember that in a shunt motor, the armature current is determined by the voltage applied across it minus the counteremf, all divided by the armature resistance. The formula should be I_a = (V - E_c) / R_a, where V is the supply voltage, E_c is the counteremf, and R_a is the armature resistance.

Wait, but the problem mentions a voltage across the brush contacts of 2 volts. Hmm, I think I might be mixing up something. Oh right, in a shunt motor, the armature is connected in parallel with the shunt field, so the voltage across the brush contacts is the same as the supply voltage minus the voltage drop in the armature circuit. Or is it? Let me think again.

Wait, no. The voltage across the brush contacts (V_brush) is actually the voltage across the armature when the motor is running. So, V_brush = V_line - I_a * R_a. Alternatively, I remember that in a shunt motor, the counteremf E_c is given by E_c = V_line - I_a * R_a. So, the armature current can be found using I_a = (V_line - E_c) / R_a.

But wait, the problem mentions a voltage across the brush contacts of 2 volts. Maybe I'm confusing brush voltage drop with something else. Let me clarify. The voltage across the brush contacts is the voltage between the two brushes, which is typically the voltage drop in the armature circuit. So, V_brush = I_a * R_a. But that might not be correct because the brush voltage drop is usually the voltage drop across the commutator and brushes, which is a part of the armature resistance. So, perhaps V_brush is the same as I_a * R_a.

Wait, the problem says the voltage across the brush contacts is 2 volts. So, V_brush = 2 V. So, that would mean I_a * R_a = 2 V. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe the total supply voltage is 115 V, and the brush voltage is a drop, so V_armature = V_line - V_brush. Or perhaps I'm getting confused between brush voltage and counteremf.

Wait, let's think again. The formula for armature current in a shunt motor is I_a = (V_line - E_c) / R_a. The counteremf E_c is generated by the motor when it's running. So, when the motor is running, the armature voltage is V_arm, which is V_line (115 V) minus the brush voltage drop (2 V), so V_arm = 115 - 2 = 113 V. But wait, that might not be right because the brush voltage drop is part of the armature resistance. So, perhaps the correct formula is I_a = (V_arm - E_c) / R_a, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. The armature voltage (V_arm) is the voltage across the armature terminals, which is equal to the supply voltage minus the drop across the brushes. So, V_arm = V_line - V_brush. Here, V_line is 115 V, and V_brush is 2 V, so V_arm = 115 - 2 = 113 V. Then, the armature current I_a is given by (V_arm - E_c) / R_a. Because the counteremf E_c is subtracted from the armature voltage to get the net voltage driving the current.

So, for part (a), E_c is 108 V. So, I_a = (113 - 108) / 0.22. Let me calculate that: 5 / 0.22 ≈ 22.727 A. Hmm, looking at the options, let's see which option has 22.7 or close to that for part (a). Let me check the options.

Option G: 22.7 and 31.8. That seems close. But wait, I might have made a mistake because I'm not sure if V_arm is 113 V. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula I_a = (V_line - E_c - V_brush) / R_a? Or maybe I should think that the brush voltage is the voltage drop in the armature, so V_brush = I_a * R_a.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the armature resistance R_a is 0.22 ohms, and the current through it is I_a, so V_brush = I_a * R_a. But the problem states that the voltage across the brush contacts is 2 volts, so V_brush = 2 V. So, I_a = V_brush / R_a = 2 / 0.22 ≈ 9.09 A. But that doesn't make sense with the options because the first part of the options are around 20 A or so. So I must be misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong. Let me think again. The correct formula for armature current in a shunt motor is I_a = (V_line - E_c) / R_a. The brush voltage drop is part of the armature resistance, so V_brush = I_a * R_a. But the problem gives V_brush as 2 V, so I_a = 2 / 0.22 ≈ 9.09 A. But that doesn't seem to match any of the options for part (a), which are around 20 A. So I'm definitely missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the voltage across the brush contacts is not the same as the armature resistance voltage drop. Maybe the brush voltage is a separate drop, so the armature voltage is V_line - V_brush. So V_arm = 115 - 2 = 113 V. Then, using I_a = (V_arm - E_c) / R_a. So for part (a), E_c = 108 V, so I_a = (113 -108)/0.22 = 5/0.22 ≈ 22.73 A. That's close to option G's first value, which is 22.7 A.

Then for part (b), E_c drops to 106 V. So I_a = (113 -106)/0.22 = 7/0.22 ≈ 31.818 A. So option G gives 22.7 and 31.8, which matches these values. So the answer should be option G.

Wait, but let me make sure that the calculation is correct. Let me recheck.

For part (a):
V_arm = 115 V (supply) - 2 V (brush drop) = 113 V
E_c = 108 V
I_a = (113 - 108) / 0.22 = 5 / 0.22 ≈ 22.727 A ≈ 22.7 A

For part (b):
E_c = 106 V
I_a = (113 - 106) / 0.22 = 7 / 0.22 ≈ 31.818 A ≈ 31.8 A

Looking at the options, option G is 22.7 and 31.8, so that's correct.
</think>

The armature current is calculated using the formula \( I_a = \frac{V_{\text{arm}} - E_c}{R_a} \), where \( V_{\text{arm}} = V_{\text{line}} - V_{\text{brush}} \). For part (a), \( V_{\text{arm}} = 115 - 2 = 113 \, \text{V} \) and \( E_c = 108 \, \text{V} \), giving \( I_a \approx 22.7 \, \text{A} \). For part (b), with \( E_c = 106 \, \text{V} \), \( I_a \approx 31.8 \, \text{A} \). Matching these values, the correct option is G.
