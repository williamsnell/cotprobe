Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm supposed to find the frequency of oscillation when a mass is attached to a wire. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem says: A 10 kg mass is resting on a table, attached to a steel wire that's 5 meters long. The wire hangs from a hook on the ceiling. When the table is removed, the wire stretches a bit, and the mass starts oscillating up and down. I need to calculate the frequency of these oscillations. The given data includes the cross-sectional area of the wire (1 square mm) and Young's Modulus (19 × 10^11 dynes/cm²). The options are from A to J, with various frequencies in vib/s.

Hmm, okay. So first, I remember that when an object is suspended by a wire and allowed to oscillate, it behaves like a mass-spring system. The wire acts as a sort of spring here. So the frequency of oscillation would be similar to that of a mass-spring system, which is given by the formula:

f = (1/2π) * sqrt(k/m)

Where f is frequency, k is the spring constant, and m is the mass.

So, I need to find k for the wire. But how do I find k for a wire under tension? Oh right, I think k can be found using the formula for the force constant of a stretched wire, which is:

k = (Y * A * L) / ΔL

Wait, no, that's the formula for the change in length due to tension. Alternatively, I think the formula for k is derived from Hooke's Law, where k is the force per unit extension. Alternatively, another approach is to find the effective spring constant of the wire when it's stretched.

Wait, let me think again. The formula for the spring constant (k) of a wire under tension is given by:

k = (Y * A) / L

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me recall. The Young's modulus Y is defined as Y = (F / A) / (ΔL / L), where F is the force applied, A is the cross-sectional area, ΔL is the change in length, and L is the original length. Rearranging that, F = (Y * A * ΔL) / L. 

But in the case of oscillation, the force F is equal to k * ΔL, where k is the spring constant. So, F = k * ΔL. Comparing both expressions, k = (Y * A) / L. Wait, but that would mean k is Y*A/L, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's (Y * A) / L, because when the wire is stretched by ΔL, the force is Y*A*(ΔL/L), so F = (Y A / L) * ΔL, which makes k = Y A / L.

Wait, but that seems a bit off because Young's modulus is Y = stress/strain = (F/A)/(ΔL/L) = (F L)/(A ΔL). So F = (Y A ΔL)/L. So F = (Y A / L) * ΔL. So yeah, that makes k = Y A / L. So k = Y * A / L.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the formula for k when dealing with a spring is k = (Y * A * L) / ΔL, but maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me make sure. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the effective spring constant for the wire is k = (Y * A) / L. So, I'll proceed with that.

So, given that, let me list the known values:

- Mass, m = 10 kg
- Length of wire, L = 5 m
- Cross-sectional area, A = 1 mm² = 1e-6 m²? Wait, but wait, the units in Young's modulus are given in dynes/cm², so perhaps I should convert all units to cgs units to avoid confusion. Because if I use SI units, I might mess up the conversions.

Wait, another approach: Let me convert everything to cgs units since Young's modulus is given in cgs. 

So, 1 kg = 1000 g, so mass m = 10 kg = 10,000 g.

Length L = 5 m = 500 cm.

Area A = 1 mm² = 1e-4 cm² (since 1 cm = 10 mm, so 1 mm² = (1/10 cm)^2 = 1e-4 cm²).

Young's modulus Y = 19 × 10^11 dynes/cm².

Now, let's compute k using k = (Y * A) / L.

So plugging in the numbers:

k = (19e11 dyn/cm²) * (1e-4 cm²) / (500 cm)

Let me compute the numerator first: 19e11 * 1e-4 = 19e7 dyn.

Then, denominator is 500 cm, so k = 19e7 / 500 = 38000 dyn/cm.

Wait, because 19e7 divided by 500 is 19e7 / 5e2 = 19e5 / 5 = 3.8e5, which is 380,000 dyn/cm. Wait, but wait, 19e7 divided by 5e2 is (19/5)*e5 = 3.8e5, which is 380,000. So k = 380,000 dyn/cm.

Wait, but wait, dynes are a unit of force. So k is in dynes per cm, since ΔL would be in cm, and F = k * ΔL.

But for the frequency formula, we need k in terms of force per unit length, but in SI units, it's in N/m. But since I'm using cgs, perhaps I can proceed.

Alternatively, maybe I should convert everything into SI units. Let me check.

So, Young's modulus Y is 19e11 dyn/cm². Let me convert that to Pascals (Pa), which is N/m².

1 dyne = 1e-5 N, and 1 cm² = (0.01 m)^2 = 1e-4 m².

So Y = 19e11 dyn/cm² = 19e11 * (1e-5 N) / (1e-4 m²) )= 19e11 * (1e-5 / 1e-4) N/m² = 19e11 * 10 = 1.9e12 Pa.

So Y = 1.9e12 Pa.

Area A = 1 mm² = 1e-6 m².

Length L = 5 m.

So k = (Y * A) / L = (1.9e12 Pa * 1e-6 m²) / 5 m.

Calculating numerator: 1.9e12 * 1e-6 = 1.9e6.

Divide by 5: 1.9e6 /5 = 3.8e5 N/m.

So k = 380,000 N/m.

Now, the mass is 10 kg, so m =10 kg.

Now, the formula for frequency is f = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(k/m).

Plugging in the numbers:

f = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(380000 /10) = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(38000).

Wait, 38000 is 3.8e4. The square root of 3.8e4 is sqrt(3.8)*100, since sqrt(1e4)=100.

So sqrt(3.8) is approximately 1.949. So 1.949 * 100 ≈ 194.9.

So f ≈ (1/(2π)) * 194.9 ≈ (194.9)/(6.283) ≈ approximately 30.98 Hz.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options, the highest is E:30 vib/s, which is probably 30 Hz. So that's option E.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations because that seems a bit high. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let's go through the steps again.

First, Y = 19e11 dyn/cm². Converting to Pa:

1 dyne = 1e-5 N, 1 cm² = 1e-4 m². So Y = 19e11 * 1e-5 N / 1e-4 m² = 19e11 * (1e-5 / 1e-4) = 19e11 * 0.1 = 1.9e12 Pa. Correct.

Area A = 1 mm² = 1e-6 m². Correct.

Length L = 5 m. Correct.

So k = (Y * A) / L = (1.9e12 * 1e-6) /5 = (1.9e6)/5 = 3.8e5 N/m. Correct.

So k is 380,000 N/m.

m =10 kg.

So f = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(380000/10) = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(38000) ≈ (1/(2π)) * 194.936 ≈ 30.98 Hz.

So approximately 31 Hz. But looking at the options, E is 30 vib/s, which is 30 Hz, and J is 10 vib/s. So 30 would be the closest option.

Wait, but wait, let me check if I messed up any unit conversions. Because 1e-6 m² for area, and Y in Pa, so yes, the calculation seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should have considered the mass in grams, but no, in the calculation, I used 10 kg which is 10,000 grams, but when calculating in SI units, mass is in kg, which is correct.

Wait another thing: When using the formula for a mass-spring system, the formula is correct, but does the wire's mass factor into this? I think the problem assumes the wire's mass is negligible compared to the 10 kg mass, so it's okay to ignore it.

Wait, but wait, in the problem statement, the wire is 5 meters long, and when the table is removed, the mass starts oscillating. So the wire's extension due to the weight of the mass would be the initial stretch, but for the oscillation, the effective spring constant is what we've calculated, so that should be correct.

So the frequency comes out to about 31 Hz, which is closest to option E:30 vib/s.

Wait, but let me check another approach. Another way to calculate the frequency is by using the formula for a vertical spring, which is similar to what I did. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the angular frequency ω = sqrt(k/m), so f = ω/(2π).

Yes, that's what I did. So the calculation seems correct.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again for any possible miscalculations.

So, 380,000 divided by 10 is 38,000. The square root of 38,000 is sqrt(3.8e4) = sqrt(3.8) * 100 ≈ 1.949 * 100 = 194.9.

Divide by 2π (≈6.283), gives approximately 194.9 /6.283≈30.98 Hz, which is about 31 Hz. So the closest option is E:30 vib/s.

Wait, but the options given are A:2, B:20, C:18, D:5, E:30, F:8, G:12, H:25, I:15, J:10.

So E is 30, which is the closest to our calculated 31. So I think E is the correct answer.

To determine the frequency of oscillation of the mass-spring system formed by the steel wire, we model the wire as a spring. The frequency \( f \) is given by:

\[
f = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}
\]

where \( k \) is the spring constant of the wire and \( m \) is the mass.

### Step 1: Calculate the Spring Constant \( k \)
The spring constant \( k \) for a wire under tension is derived from Young's Modulus \( Y \), the cross-sectional area \( A \), and the length \( L \) of the wire:

\[
k = \frac{Y \cdot A}{L}
\]

Given:
- \( Y = 19 \times 10^{11} \, \text{dyn/cm}^2 = 1.9 \times 10^{12} \, \text{Pa} \) (converted to SI units),
- \( A = 1 \, \text{mm}^2 = 1 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^2 \),
- \( L = 5 \, \text{m} \),

we calculate:

\[
k = \frac{(1.9 \times 10^{12}) \cdot (1 \times 10^{-6})}{5} = 3.8 \times 10^5 \, \text{N/m}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Frequency
The mass \( m \) is \( 10 \, \text{kg} \). Substituting \( k \) and \( m \) into the frequency formula:

\[
f = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{3.8 \times 10^5}{10}} = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{3.8 \times 10^4}.
\]

First, calculate the square root:

\[
\sqrt{3.8 \times 10^4} = \sqrt{3.8} \cdot 100 \approx 1.949 \cdot 100 = 194.9.
\]

Then, divide by \( 2\pi \):

\[
f = \frac{194.9}{6.283} \approx 30.98 \, \text{Hz}.
\]

### Step 3: Match with the Options
The calculated frequency is approximately \( 31 \, \text{Hz} \), which is closest to option **E: 30 vib/s**.
