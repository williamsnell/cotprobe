Question:

Hall Co. purchased a machine on January 1 at a cost of $140000. The machine had an estimated useful life of eight years and a salvage value of $60000. Hall chose to depreciate the machine using the double- declining balance method. What was the carrying amount of the machine in Hall's balance sheet at the end of its second year of operations?

Options:

A: $60,000
B: $70,000
C: $61,250
D: $100,000
E: $85,000
F: $78,750
G: 80000
H: $90,000
I: $95,000
J: $110,000

Okay, so I've got this question about depreciation using the double-declining balance method. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

Alright, Hall Co. bought a machine for $140,000. The machine is expected to last eight years with a salvage value of $60,000. They're using double-declining balance for depreciation. The question is asking for the carrying amount at the end of the second year.

First, I think I need to figure out the depreciation each year using the double-declining method. I remember that double-declining is an accelerated method, so the depreciation is higher in the early years.

Let me start by calculating the straight-line depreciation rate and then double it. The straight-line rate is 1 divided by the useful life. So 1/8 is 0.125, or 12.5%. Double that gives me 25%, which is 0.25.

Now, for the first year, the depreciation would be 25% of the cost. The cost is $140,000. So 140,000 * 0.25 = $35,000. That means the book value at the end of the first year is 140,000 - 35,000 = $105,000.

Moving on to the second year. I think in the second year, you use the same rate but apply it to the new book value from the end of the first year. So again, 25% of $105,000. Let me calculate that: 105,000 * 0.25 = $26,250. Subtracting that from the previous year's book value gives me 105,000 - 26,250 = $78,750.

Wait, but I should make sure I'm not dropping below the salvage value. The salvage value is $60,000, and at the end of the second year, the book value is $78,750, which is higher than the salvage value. So that's okay; no need to adjust yet.

Let me check the options. The options are A to J. The value I got is $78,750. Looking at the options, F is $78,750. So that should be the correct answer.

I think I did this right, but let me double-check. Another way to think about it is to use the formula each year. First year: 140,000 * 2/8 = 35,000. Second year: (140,000 - 35,000) * 2/8 = 105,000 * 0.25 = 26,250. So yes, subtracting 26,250 from 105,000 gives 78,750. Yep, that's correct.

The carrying amount of the machine at the end of the second year is calculated using the double-declining balance method. The depreciation rate is 25% each year. After two years, the carrying amount is $78,750.
