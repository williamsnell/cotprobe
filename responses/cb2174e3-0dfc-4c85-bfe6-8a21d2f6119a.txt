Okay, so I have this question about Rob and his cat food consumption. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question says Rob uses 1 box of cat food every 5 days. I need to find out how many boxes he uses per month. Hmm, first I should clarify what the question is asking. It's about the number of boxes per month, so I need to calculate based on a month's duration.

Wait, but how many days are in a month? I remember that months vary, but for these kinds of problems, people usually assume an average month. I think the commonly used average is about 30 days. Yeah, I've heard that before—like 30 days a month for calculations. So I'll go with that.

So, if a month is 30 days, and Rob uses 1 box every 5 days, I can figure out how many 5-day periods are in 30 days. To do that, I'll divide 30 by 5. Let me write that down: 30 ÷ 5 = 6. So that means there are 6 intervals of 5 days in a month.

Since he uses 1 box each 5 days, I multiply the number of boxes per 5 days by the number of 5-day periods in a month. That would be 1 box/5 days * 6 periods. So 1 * 6 = 6 boxes. 

Let me double-check to make sure I didn't mess up. If he uses 1 box every 5 days, then in 5 days it's 1 box, 10 days 2 boxes, 15 days 3, 20 days 4, 25 days 5, and 30 days 6 boxes. Yep, that adds up. 

Looking at the options, option C is 6 boxes. So that must be the correct answer. I don't think I made any mistakes here. It's straightforward division and multiplication.

The calculation is based on dividing the number of days in a month by the number of days it takes to use one box. Assuming a 30-day month, dividing by 5 gives 6 intervals, each requiring one box. Thus, the answer is 6 boxes.

Answer: C
