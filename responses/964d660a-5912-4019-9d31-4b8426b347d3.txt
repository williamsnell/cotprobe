Question:

A landscaper agreed to maintain the yard of a homeowner for six months for a fee of $300 per month, payable at the end of the six-month period. This amount was the fair market value of the work to be performed. The landscaper performed the work for four months but was then offered another job for $500 per month and, after notifying the homeowner, stopped doing the promised work and took the other job. The homeowner refused to pay the landscaper anything. The homeowner could have hired a comparable landscaper to complete the work for $300 per month. In a lawsuit between the landscaper and the homeowner, what is the likely result?

Options:

A: The landscaper will recover $900 for the work done before the breach.
B: The homeowner will recover $500, which is the cost of hiring a new landscaper.
C: The homeowner will recover $300, which constitutes the unjust enrichment of the landscaper.
D: The landscaper will recover $1,500 for the work done before the breach.
E: The landscaper will recover $1,800, considering the new job offer.
F: The homeowner will recover $1,200, which is the cost of completing the work at prevailing market rates.
G: The homeowner will recover $400, which constitutes the unjust enrichment of the landscaper.
H: Neither the landscaper nor the homeowner will recover, because neither has suffered any loss.
I: The landscaper will recover $1,200 for the work done before the breach.
J: The homeowner will recover $600, which is the cost of completing the work at prevailing market rates.

Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, a landscaper agreed to maintain a homeowner's yard for six months at $300 per month, which is the fair market value. The landscaper worked for four months, then got a better job offer of $500 per month and left, telling the homeowner. The homeowner refused to pay anything. The question is about what the court would likely decide in the lawsuit.

Hmm, so first, I need to understand the contract terms. The contract was for six months, $300 each month, paid at the end. The landscaper did four months, so the homeowner hasn't paid for those four months yet. But the landscaper stopped working after four months because of a better offer.

I think this is a case of breach of contract. The landscaper didn't complete the six months as agreed. But the homeowner is refusing to pay anything, so maybe the landscaper is suing for the money owed for the four months, while the homeowner might counter-sue for damages.

Wait, but the problem says the landscaper performed for four months. So under the contract, the homeowner is supposed to pay $300 each month at the end of the period. So after four months, the homeowner hasn't paid anything yet because the six months haven't ended. But the landscaper left, so the homeowner might say they don't have to pay because the service wasn't completed.

But in contract law, if one party breaches, the other can sue for damages. The key here is whether the breaching party is liable for the work done before the breach. So the landscaper did four months of work. The homeowner might argue that they don't have to pay because the landscaper didn't finish the contract. Alternatively, the landscaper might argue that they should be paid for the four months they worked.

Looking at the options, some are about the landscaper recovering money for the work done. Let's see the options:

Option A: $900 for four months (300*3). Wait, no, 4 months would be $1200. So maybe that's not right.

Option D: $1500, which is 300*5, but the landscaper only worked four months. So that's not matching.

Option I: $1200 for four months. That makes sense because 300*4=1200.

But then, the homeowner could argue that they don't have to pay because the landscaper breached by leaving early. Wait, but the payment was supposed to be at the end of the six-month period. So the landscaper performed the work, but the payment was due at the end. So maybe the homeowner is liable for the four months' worth of work because the payment was due upon completion of the term, not monthly.

Wait, no, the contract says the fee is $300 per month, payable at the end of the six-month period. So the total would be $1800, paid all at once at the end. So the homeowner hasn't paid anything yet. The landscaper did four months of work but didn't complete the six.

So does the homeowner owe anything for the four months? Or can they refuse to pay because the service wasn't completed?

In contract law, if one party breaches, the non-breaching party can usually recover for the work done before the breach, especially if the payment was for the entire period. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but the contract might be for a specific performance over six months, so the payment is at the end. If the landscaper leaves after four months, the homeowner could argue that they don't have to pay because the full service wasn't rendered. But the landscaper might argue that they're owed for the partial work.

Alternatively, maybe the homeowner can get a refund for the three months not worked, but that's not one of the options.

Another angle: the landscaper was supposed to be paid at the end, so the homeowner didn't have any obligation until the end. But the landscaper did the work, so under the principle of unjust enrichment, the homeowner can't keep the benefit without paying. So the homeowner would have to pay for the four months, even though the contract was for six.

But the question is about who sues whom. The landscaper is suing the homeowner, probably for the four months' worth. So the likely outcome is that the landscaper recovers $1200, which is four months at $300 each.

Looking at the options, option I says the landscaper recovers $1200. But wait, option F says the homeowner recovers $1200. No, option F is about the homeowner recovering for completing the work at market rates.

Wait, the homeowner could argue that they had to hire someone else to finish the remaining two months at $300 each, so total $600. But the landscaper left after four months, so the homeowner had to pay another $600. But the options don't mention that. Alternatively, the homeowner might argue that the landscaper is owed nothing because they breached.

But I think the correct approach is that the landscaper is entitled to payment for the work done before the breach. So the answer would be that the landscaper recovers $1200, which is option I.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option I: The landscaper will recover $1,200 for the work done before the breach. Yes, that matches.

But wait, the homeowner could argue that the landscaper's breach entitles them to not pay. But generally, the non-breaching party can recover for the work done before the breach. So the landscaper should get $1200.

So the answer should be option I.

The landscaper performed four months of work under a six-month contract and is entitled to payment for the work done before the breach. The homeowner cannot refuse to pay for the partial performance. The correct answer is that the landscaper recovers $1,200.
