Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about bubbles in water and calculating the pressure difference needed. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

The question says that air is introduced through a nozzle into a tank of water, forming a stream of bubbles. The bubbles are supposed to have a diameter of 2 mm. I need to find out by how much the pressure of the air at the nozzle must exceed the surrounding water pressure. The surface tension σ is given as 72.7 × 10^-3 N/m.

Wait, surface tension... Oh right, surface tension is the energy required to increase the surface area of a liquid. It's related to the pressure difference across a curved surface, like a bubble. Bubbles in water would have a pressure inside the bubble higher than the outside because of surface tension.

I think the formula I need here is the one that relates the pressure difference across a spherical surface due to surface tension. The formula is ΔP = 2σ/(r), where ΔP is the pressure difference, σ is the surface tension, and r is the radius of the bubble.

Wait, let me make sure. So, for a bubble, which has two surfaces (inside and outside), the pressure difference is 2σ/r. Yeah, that sounds right. Because a liquid drop has only one surface, so ΔP would be σ/r for that, but a bubble has two surfaces, so it's double.

So the bubble diameter is 2 mm, so the radius r is half of that, which is 1 mm. But wait, 1 mm is 0.001 meters. Let me convert that properly. 1 mm = 1e-3 meters.

Now, plugging the values into the formula:

ΔP = 2 * σ / r.

σ is 72.7e-3 N/m, and r is 0.001 m.

So let's compute that:

2 * 72.7e-3 / 0.001.

Wait, 72.7e-3 is the same as 0.0727 N/m.

So 2 * 0.0727 = 0.1454.

Then, 0.1454 divided by 0.001 is the same as multiplying by 1000, which gives 145.4 N/m², or Pascals.

Looking at the options, option B is 143.4 N/m², which is close to my calculation. Hmm, maybe there was a slight approximation in the numbers? Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 72.7e-3 is 0.0727. Multiply by 2: 0.0727 * 2 = 0.1454. Then divide by 0.001 m: 0.1454 / 0.001 = 145.4. Oh, but the option is 143.4. That's a bit lower. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I should double-check the formula. Oh, wait, for a single bubble in water, is it 2σ/r or σ/(2r)? No, no, wait: when the bubble is in water, the pressure inside the bubble is higher because the surface tension acts to create a pressure difference. For a single bubble, the pressure is higher by 2σ/r, because the surface has two sides (the inner and outer surfaces of the bubble membrane). So the formula should indeed be 2σ/r.

So perhaps the options have rounded the value. Let me compute 72.7e-3 * 2 = 0.1454. Then divided by 0.001 is 145.4. But the closest option is B:143.4. Maybe the question uses a different approach?

Wait, alternatively, maybe I should consider the radius as 2 mm? No, that can't be right. The diameter is 2 mm, so radius is 1 mm. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me compute it again.

72.7 × 10^-3 N/m is 0.0727 N/m.

So 2 * 0.0727 = 0.1454 N/m.

Divide by r = 0.001 m: 0.1454 / 0.001 = 145.4 N/m².

Looking at the options, the closest one is B:143.4. Hmm, maybe the given σ is 72.7e-3 N/m, so perhaps I should keep it as 72.7 × 10^-3 without converting to decimal.

Wait, 72.7 ×10^-3 is 0.0727, so that part's correct. Maybe the problem expects the answer to be 2σ divided by diameter, not radius? Let's see: 2σ/(d). So 2 * 72.7e-3 / 0.002.

Wait, if I use diameter instead of radius, then r = d/2, so the formula becomes ΔP = 2σ/(d/2) = 4σ/d.

So 4*72.7e-3 / 0.002.

Compute 72.7e-3 is 0.0727.

4 * 0.0727 = 0.2908.

Divide by 0.002: 0.2908 / 0.002 = 145.4. Same result.

So why is option B 143.4? Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different radius, like considering the bubble as a hemisphere or something else. Hmm, no, I think I did it right.

Wait, perhaps I should be precise with the numbers. Let me compute 72.7 × 2 = 145.4, then divided by 0.001 (since r=0.001). So yes, 145.4 N/m².

Looking at the options again, option B is 143.4, which is close but not exact. Is there a chance I should consider the units differently? No, the units are okay: N/m is correct for surface tension, radius in meters gives pressure in Pascals (N/m²).

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the pressure in Pascals, and the options are given with three significant figures. So 145.4 would round to 145, but the option is 143.4. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the formula as σ divided by radius, not multiplied by 2.

Wait, no, because for a bubble, the pressure difference is 2σ/r. If I had used σ/r, I would get 72.7e-3 / 0.001 = 72.7 N/m², which is option F. But that's much lower than the options. So I think the correct approach is 2σ/r.

Wait, maybe the question is using a different approach, like considering the pressure required to overcome the surface tension for a hemispherical bubble, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the pressure to be equal to the surface tension divided by the radius, which would be 72.7e-3 / 0.001 = 72.7 N/m², but that's option F. But that doesn't match my initial thought about bubbles needing double the surface tension.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the formula. Surface tension in bubbles: for a single soap bubble, the pressure difference is 2σ/r because there are two surfaces (inside and outside). For a liquid drop, it's σ/r because only one surface. So in this case, the bubble is in water, so it's surrounded by water, so the internal air pressure must be higher by 2σ/r.

So I think my calculation of 145.4 N/m² is correct, but since the options don't have that, the closest is B:143.4. Maybe the exact value is 145.4, but perhaps the options have rounded down. Alternatively, perhaps the surface tension was given as 72.7 ×10^-3, which is 0.0727, and when multiplied by 2 and divided by 0.001, it's 145.4. But none of the options exactly match that. Wait, looking at the options again, option B is 143.4, which is 72.7 ×2 / 0.001 = 145.4. So perhaps a typo in options? Or maybe I missed a factor somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the pressure required to create the bubble, which could involve other factors, but I think the formula remains 2σ/r.

Wait, perhaps the units were given in mm, and I forgot to convert correctly. The diameter is 2 mm, which is 0.002 m, so radius is 0.001 m, which is correct. So no mistake there.

Hmm, maybe I should check if the formula is actually σ/(r), not 2σ/r. Let me think: for a liquid drop, the pressure inside is higher by σ/r. For a bubble in a liquid, the pressure inside is higher by 2σ/r because there are two surfaces. So yes, the formula is correct as 2σ/r.

So, despite the options, the correct pressure difference should be approximately 145.4 N/m². But the closest option is B:143.4. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to use the diameter instead of radius, but that would give a higher value, not lower.

Wait, if I mistakenly used diameter instead of radius, let's see: 2σ/(d/2) = 4σ/d. So 4 *72.7e-3 / 0.002 = (4 *0.0727)/0.002 = 0.2908 /0.002 = 145.4. Same result as before. So that doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps the surface tension value was given as 72.7 ×10^-3 N/m, which is 0.0727. So 2 *0.0727 = 0.1454. Divided by 0.001 is 145.4. So I'm confident that the correct answer should be 145.4, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is B:143.4, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute it again precisely:

σ = 72.7 × 10^-3 N/m = 0.0727 N/m.

r = 1 mm = 0.001 m.

ΔP = 2 * σ / r = (2 * 0.0727) / 0.001 = 0.1454 / 0.001 = 145.4 N/m².

So the correct answer should be 145.4, but the closest option is B:143.4, which is 143.4. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of significant figures. Let's see: 72.7 is three significant figures, so 72.7e-3 is three sig figs. So 2 * 72.7e-3 = 145.4e-3, which is 0.1454. Divided by 0.001 (one sig fig), but that's not right. Wait, 0.001 has one significant figure, but in reality, the radius is given as 2 mm, which is one decimal place, so maybe that's where the approximation comes in.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be 143.4, which would be 72.7 * 2 = 145.4, but perhaps the options have a typo, and the correct option should be around 145.4. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for 145.4 in the options, but it's not present. The options are:

A:50
B:143.4
C:125.6
D:180
E:215.1
F:72.7
G:87.3
H:100
I:190.2
J:160.8

So the closest is B:143.4, which is about 143.4. I think I must have made a mistake in the calculation, but I can't see where. Alternatively, perhaps the question uses a different approach, but I'm confident that the formula is correct. Maybe the answer is B:143.4, considering possible rounding in the problem's numbers.

To determine the pressure difference required to form bubbles with a diameter of 2 mm in water, we use the formula for the pressure difference across a spherical surface due to surface tension:

\[
\Delta P = \frac{2\sigma}{r}
\]

Where:
- \(\sigma = 72.7 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{N/m}\) (surface tension),
- \(r = \frac{\text{diameter}}{2} = \frac{2 \, \text{mm}}{2} = 1 \, \text{mm} = 0.001 \, \text{m}\).

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta P = \frac{2 \times 72.7 \times 10^{-3}}{0.001} = \frac{0.1454}{0.001} = 145.4 \, \text{N/m}^2
\]

The calculated pressure difference is approximately \(145.4 \, \text{N/m}^2\). Among the given options, the closest value is **B: 143.4 N/m²**, which likely accounts for rounding or slight approximations in the problem's parameters.

**Answer: B**
