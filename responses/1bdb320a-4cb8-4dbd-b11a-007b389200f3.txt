Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is asking which two numbers both round to 1,500 when rounded to the nearest hundred. The options are A through H, each with two numbers. I need to check each pair to see if both round to 1,500.

First, I remember that rounding to the nearest hundred means looking at the tens and units digits. If the number is 50 or more in the tens place, you round up, otherwise, you round down. So, for a number to round to 1,500, it should be between 1,450 and 1,549.99... because anything from 1,450 up to but not including 1,550 would round to 1,500 when rounding to the nearest hundred.

Wait, no, actually, when rounding to the nearest hundred, the cutoff is at 1,500. So, numbers from 1,450 to 1,549 (since 1,550 would round up to 1,600). So, any number starting from 1,450 up to 1,549 would round to 1,500.

Let me go through each option:

Option A: 1,444 and 1,555.
- 1,444: The tens digit is 4, which is less than 5, so it would round down to 1,400. So this doesn't round to 1,500. So A is out.

Option B: 1,453 and 1,563.
- 1,453: The tens digit is 5, so it rounds up to 1,500. Good.
- 1,563: The tens digit is 6, which is 5 or more, so it rounds up to 1,600. That's not 1,500. So B is out.

Option C: 1,449 and 1,549.
- 1,449: Tens digit is 4, so rounds down to 1,400. Not good.
- 1,549: Tens digit is 4, so rounds down to 1,500. Wait, but 1,549 is 1,500 when rounded? Wait, no. Wait, 1,549 is 1,500 when rounded to the nearest hundred? Let me think again. The hundreds digit is 5, so 1,549 is 1,500 because the tens digit is 4, which is less than 5, so you round down. Wait, no, no, wait. When you're rounding 1,549 to the nearest hundred, you look at the tens and units: 49. Since 49 is less than 50, you round down, so 1,500. So 1,549 would round to 1,500. But 1,449 would round to 1,400 because the tens digit is 4, so it's below 50. So C has one number that rounds to 1,500 and one that rounds to 1,400. So C is out.

Option D: 1,499 and 1,599.
- 1,499: The tens digit is 9 (since 1,499 is 1,499, so tens digit is 9, units is 9). Wait, no, 1,499 is 1,4 (hundreds) 9 (tens) 9 (units). So when rounding to the nearest hundred, you look at the tens and units. Since 99 is more than 50, you round up. So 1,499 would round up to 1,500. That's correct.
- 1,599: Tens digit is 9, so 99 again. So 1,599 would round up to 1,600. So the second number in D doesn't round to 1,500. So D is out.

Option E: 1,489 and 1,589.
- 1,489: Tens digit is 8, units is 9. So 89 is more than 50, so rounds up to 1,500.
- 1,589: Tens digit is 8, so 89 again. So 1,589 rounds up to 1,600. So E is out because the second number doesn't round to 1,500.

Option F: 1,457 and 1,547.
- 1,457: Tens digit is 5, so rounds up to 1,500.
- 1,547: Tens digit is 4, so rounds down to 1,500. Wait, 1,547 is 1,547. The hundreds digit is 5, but we're rounding to the nearest hundred. So the tens digit is 4, which is less than 5, so you round down. So 1,547 would round to 1,500. So both numbers in F round to 1,500. So F is a possible answer.

Wait, but let me make sure. 1,457: 457. 57 is more than 50, so rounds up to 500. So 1,457 rounds to 1,500. Correct.

1,547: 547. 47 is less than 50, so rounds down to 500. So 1,547 rounds to 1,500. Correct. So both numbers in F round to 1,500. So F is a candidate.

Option G: 1,445 and 1,555.
- 1,445: Tens digit is 4, so rounds down to 1,400. So no.
- 1,555: Tens digit is 5, so rounds up to 1,600. So G is out.

Option H: 1,399 and 1,599.
- 1,399: Tens digit is 9, so 99 is more than 50, rounds up to 1,400. So that's 1,400, not 1,500. So H is out.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again. When rounding 1,499 to the nearest hundred, the tens digit is 9, which is 5 or more, so it rounds up to 1,500. So D's first number is correct, but the second is 1,599, which rounds to 1,600. So D is out.

So, going back, F is the only option where both numbers round to 1,500. So the answer should be F.

The correct answer is F: 1,457 and 1,547. Both numbers round to 1,500 when rounded to the nearest hundred.

Answer: F
