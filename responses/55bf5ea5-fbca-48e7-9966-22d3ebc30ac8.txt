Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the value of an investment after 10 years. The initial investment is $4000, and the growth rate is given as 320 times e raised to the power of 0.08t dollars per year after t years. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about how to approach this. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with investments, especially with continuous growth, the formula usually involves integrating the growth rate over time. But wait, the problem says the growth rate is 320e^(0.08t) dollars per year. So, this is the rate at which the investment grows each year, right? So, to find the total growth over 10 years, I think I need to calculate the integral of this growth rate from t=0 to t=10. Because the growth rate is a function of time, it's not a constant rate, so simple multiplication won't work here.

Let me write down the formula for the total growth. The total amount A after t years would be the initial investment plus the integral of the growth rate from 0 to t. So, A(t) = 4000 + ∫₀ᵗ 320e^(0.08τ) dτ. That makes sense because each year's growth depends on that exponential function.

Now, I need to compute this integral. The integral of e^(kt) dt is (1/k)e^(kt) + C, right? So here, k is 0.08. Let's compute the integral ∫320e^(0.08τ) dτ from 0 to 10.

Breaking it down, the integral of e^(0.08τ) is (1/0.08)e^(0.08τ). So, multiplying by 320, the integral becomes 320*(1/0.08)(e^(0.08τ)) evaluated from 0 to 10.

Let me calculate that. 320 divided by 0.08 is... let's see, 320 / 0.08. Well, 0.08 times 4000 is 320, so 320 / 0.08 is 4000. So the integral simplifies to 4000*(e^(0.08*10) - e^(0)).

Wait, e^(0) is 1, so this becomes 4000*(e^0.8 - 1). Now, I need to find e^0.8. I remember that e^0.7 is about 2.0138, e^0.8 should be a bit higher. Let me think, e^0.6 is about 1.822, e^0.7 is 2.0138, e^0.8 is approximately 2.2255. I'm not 100% sure, but I'll go with that for now.

So, e^0.8 ≈ 2.2255. Subtracting 1 gives 1.2255. Then, multiplying by 4000: 4000 * 1.2255. Let me calculate that. 4000 * 1.2 is 4800, and 4000 * 0.0255 is 102. So, adding those together, 4800 + 102 = 4902. Therefore, the total growth over 10 years is approximately $4902.

Wait, but the initial investment was $4000. So the total value after 10 years would be 4000 + 4902 = 8902. Let me check the options. Option E is $8,902. So that would be the answer, right?

Hold on, did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me double-check the integral. The integral of 320e^(0.08τ) dτ is indeed (320/0.08)e^(0.08τ), which is 4000e^(0.08τ). Evaluated from 0 to 10, that's 4000(e^0.8 - 1), which is correct. And e^0.8 is approximately 2.2255, so that part seems right too.

So, the total amount is 4000 + 4000*(2.2255 -1) = 4000 + 4000*1.2255 = 4000 + 4902 = 8902. So, option E is correct. But wait, looking at the options, E is $8,902. That makes sense. 

Alternatively, maybe I should check if I interpreted the problem correctly. The problem says the investment grows at the rate of 320e^(0.08t) dollars per year. So the rate is 320e^(0.08t), which is correct. So integrating that from 0 to 10 gives the total interest, which is added to the principal. Yep, that's correct.

I think I'm confident that E is the right answer.

The value of the investment after 10 years is calculated by integrating the growth rate function over time and adding it to the initial investment. The integral of 320e^(0.08t) from 0 to 10 results in a total growth of approximately $4,902. Adding this to the initial $4,000 investment gives a total value of $8,902.

The final answer is E.
