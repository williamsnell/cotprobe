Question:

A 3-year-old white girl is brought to the office by her parents for a follow-up visit 48 hours after receiving a 5-TU PPD skin test. The test was done as part of a routine screening for enrollment in a homeless shelter. Physical examination shows 10 mm of induration at the puncture site; the examination is otherwise normal. The parents tell you they are shocked by this finding since both of their skin tests were nonreactive. They say they were born in this country and tell you that their daughter has always been in good health. She has not had much medical care in the past 2 years but she has been healthy. Until moving into this shelter they had been "squatters" in vacant buildings. Which of the following is the most appropriate step at this time?

Options:

A: Call her previous physician to obtain more history
B: Order a chest x-ray
C: Order a test for HIV antibody
D: Repeat the PPD skin test

Okay, so I need to figure out the right answer for this question. Let's go through it step by step.

The patient is a 3-year-old girl who had a PPD skin test 48 hours ago. The result shows 10 mm of induration. The parents are shocked because both of their own tests were negative. They were born in the country, the child is healthy, and they've been squatters in vacant buildings until recently moving into a shelter.

First, I remember that the PPD test is used to detect TB infection. A positive result (usually >=5 mm induration) suggests exposure to TB bacteria. But there are several factors to consider here.

The child's result is 10 mm, which is definitely positive. But why are the parents' tests negative? They were born here, so maybe they were vaccinated with BCG as infants, but that's not common in the US. Or perhaps they've never been exposed. But the child is their daughter, so if the parents weren't exposed, how did she get a positive test?

Wait, the family was living in vacant buildings as squatters. That environment could be a risk factor for TB exposure. Maybe the child was exposed to someone with active TB, even if the parents weren't. Or perhaps the child has latent TB, but how?

Another thought: The PPD can sometimes give false positives due to other infections or conditions. But in this case, the child is otherwise healthy, so that might not be the issue.

The options are:

A: Call her previous physician for more history.
B: Order a chest x-ray.
C: Order an HIV antibody test.
D: Repeat the PPD.

I think about each option. Option A would help get more information about past medical history, which could be useful, but maybe the more pressing issue is whether the child has active TB.

Option B, a chest x-ray, is often done if the PPD is positive to check for active TB. Since the child is young and could have latent TB, imaging might be necessary to rule out active disease.

Option C, testing for HIV, is important because HIV can affect TB results. If the child is HIV-positive, she might have a different interpretation. Plus, people with HIV are more at risk for active TB.

Option D suggests repeating the PPD. Usually, you repeat it if there's doubt about the result, like if it was done incorrectly. But 10 mm is a clear positive, so maybe not necessary unless there's a reason to think the test was faulty.

So, the immediate next steps after a positive PPD in a child would be to assess if there's active TB. That would involve a chest x-ray. Also, considering HIV because it can influence TB severity and treatment.

But wait, the parents' tests were negative. Could the child have been exposed to TB from someone else, like another person in the shelter or in their previous living situations? Maybe the parents weren't tested recently, or maybe they were vaccinated and that's why their tests are negative.

I think the most appropriate next steps are to order a chest x-ray (option B) and possibly an HIV test (option C). But the question asks for the most appropriate step at this time. Since the PPD is positive, chest x-ray is a standard follow-up to rule out active TB. So option B might be the first step.

Alternatively, maybe the child is at high risk for TB because of living conditions, and the positive PPD indicates latent TB, so treatment might be started. But first, you need to confirm if it's active or latent.

Wait, the question is about the most appropriate step. So, after a positive PPD, the next step is often a chest x-ray to check for active disease. So B is likely correct.

Another angle: If the child has a positive PPD, and there's a possibility of recent exposure, they should be evaluated for active TB. So chest x-ray is needed.

So the answer is B: Order a chest x-ray.

The patient is a 3-year-old girl with a positive PPD result (10 mm induration) following a routine screening for a homeless shelter. The parents, whose own PPD tests were negative, report living in suboptimal conditions as squatters before moving into the shelter. A positive PPD suggests possible exposure to TB bacteria, but the parents' negative results raise questions about the source of exposure. The child's otherwise normal physical exam and health history do not indicate active disease, but further evaluation is needed.

**Option A** (calling the previous physician) could provide additional historical information but is not the most immediate next step. **Option D** (repeating the PPD) is unnecessary here, as the result is clear and unambiguous. **Option C** (testing for HIV) is important, as HIV can influence TB severity, but the immediate concern is ruling out active TB. **Option B** (ordering a chest x-ray) is the most appropriate step to assess for active TB, as it is a standard follow-up after a positive PPD.

Answer: B
