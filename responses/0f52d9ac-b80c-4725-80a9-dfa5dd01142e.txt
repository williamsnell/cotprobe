Question:

Life span developmental theories, such as Baltes’s Selective Optimization with Compensation theory,

Options:

C: Suggest that development is a linear process without any decline
D: All of the above
E: Are mainly concerned with cognitive development
F: Only account for biological influences on development

H: Describe development as a process of decline (loss) and growth (gain)
I: Claim that development stops after adulthood
J: Do not account for environmental influences on development

Okay, so I have this question about lifespan developmental theories, specifically Baltes's Selective Optimization with Compensation (SOC) theory. The question is asking which option correctly describes this theory. Let's break it down.

First, I remember that lifespan theories look at development across a person's entire life, not just childhood or adolescence. Baltes's SOC theory is one of these. From what I recall, SOC emphasizes that development isn't just about gains but also involves losses. It's a more comprehensive view that includes both positive growth and negative declines as people age.

Looking at the options:

A: Focus solely on early childhood. No, I think SOC considers the whole lifespan, so this is probably wrong.

B: Focus on psychopathology. I'm not sure, but SOC is more about general development, not just mental disorders.

C: Development is linear without decline. No, because SOC includes both gains and losses, so it's not linear.

D: All of the above. Well, I don't think A, B, or C are correct, so D is likely wrong.

E: Mainly concerned with cognitive development. No, SOC is broader, covering various aspects, not just cognitive.

F: Only account for biological influences. No, SOC also considers psychological and environmental factors.

G: Process of growth and decline. This sounds right because SOC talks about both gains and losses.

H: Decline and growth, but the order is different. Wait, SOC says gains and losses, but I'm not sure if the order matters. Maybe H is also correct, but I think the key is that both happen.

I: Development stops after adulthood. No, SOC is about the whole lifespan, so this is incorrect.

J: Don't account for environment. No, environmental influences are part of SOC.

Wait, the question is about what the theories suggest. So looking back, the SOC theory does talk about both growth and decline, which is a process of gain and loss. So option G says "growth (gain) and decline (loss)", which matches. Option H says "decline and growth", which might be the same but perhaps the order is reversed. But I think G is correct because it's about both processes, not just one happening after the other. 

So the answer should be G.

The answer is G. Baltes’s Selective Optimization with Compensation (SOC) theory describes development as a process involving both growth (gain) and decline (loss), making option G the correct choice.
