Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states: One gram of water (which is 1 cm³) becomes 1671 cm³ of steam when boiled at 1 atm pressure. The heat of vaporization at this pressure is 539 cal/gm. I need to compute the external work and the increase in internal energy. There are several options to choose from, labeled A to J.

Alright, first, I remember that when a substance changes from liquid to gas, it absorbs heat, which is the heat of vaporization. But in thermodynamics, when work is done, especially in expansion, there's a relation between the heat absorbed, the work done, and the change in internal energy.

Wait, the first law of thermodynamics says that the change in internal energy (ΔU) equals the heat added to the system (Q) minus the work done by the system (W). So, ΔU = Q - W. But I need to make sure about the signs here. In physics, work done by the system is considered positive, so if the system is doing work, it's losing energy, hence subtracted from Q.

But wait, in this problem, the water is expanding into steam, so it's doing work on the surroundings. So the system (water) is doing work, which would be external work. So the external work done would be positive, and the system's internal energy would decrease by that amount plus any heat added.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The heat of vaporization is the heat required to convert liquid water into steam at the same temperature. So, Q would be the heat added to the system, which is 539 cal/gm multiplied by 1 gram, so 539 calories.

Now, the work done is the expansion work. For an ideal gas, the work done is PΔV. But here, the steam isn't an ideal gas, but maybe we can approximate it. Since the process is at constant pressure (1 atm), the work done by the system is P times the change in volume.

Wait, but wait. The initial volume is 1 cm³ (liquid water), and the final volume is 1671 cm³ (steam). So the change in volume ΔV is 1671 - 1 = 1670 cm³. But since pressure is in atmospheres and work is in calories, I need to convert cm³ to liters, perhaps? Because 1 L·atm is approximately 24.71 cal.

Wait, 1 cm³ is 0.001 liters, so 1670 cm³ is 1.67 liters. So ΔV is 1.67 L.

So the work done by the system (external work) is PΔV. P is 1 atm, so W = 1 atm * 1.67 L = 1.67 L·atm.

Now, converting L·atm to calories: 1 L·atm ≈ 24.71 cal. So 1.67 L·atm ≈ 1.67 * 24.71 ≈ let's calculate that. 1.67 * 24 is about 40.08, and 1.67 * 0.71 is about 1.1857. So total ≈ 41.2657 cal. Let's round it to about 41 cal.

Wait, but wait, that's the work done by the system. So in the first law, ΔU = Q - W. So Q is 539 cal, W is 41 cal. So ΔU = 539 - 41 = 498 cal.

Wait, no. Wait, no, no. The system is the water. When the system does work, it's losing energy. So the internal energy change is Q (heat added) minus the work done by the system. So yes, ΔU = 539 - 41 = 498 cal.

But wait, let's make sure. The heat of vaporization is the heat absorbed by the system. So Q is +539 cal. The work done by the system is +41 cal. So ΔU is 539 -41 = +498 cal. So the internal energy increases by 498 cal.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see: option B says external work is 498 and internal energy is 539. Hmm, no. Option E says external work 41, internal energy 498. Option E looks like it's correct, but wait, no. Wait, because the question is about external work. Wait, wait, external work done by the system is the same as the work done by the system, which is 41 cal. So the external work is 41 cal.

So the internal energy increases by 498 cal.

Looking at the options, option E says external work:41 cal, increase in internal energy:498 cal. So that would be correct.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another approach: the heat added is 539 cal. The work done by the system is 41 cal. So the change in internal energy is 539 -41 =498. So yes.

But another way to think: the heat goes into both the internal energy and the work done. So Q = ΔU + W, where W is the work done by the system. So yes, same result.

So the external work is 41 cal, and internal energy increases by 498 cal. So the correct option is E.

The problem involves calculating the external work done and the increase in internal energy when 1 gram of water vaporizes at 1 atm pressure. The heat of vaporization is given as 539 cal/gm.

1. **Heat Added (Q):** The heat required to vaporize 1 gram of water is calculated as:
   \[
   Q = 539 \, \text{cal/gm} \times 1 \, \text{gm} = 539 \, \text{cal}.
   \]

2. **Work Done (W):** The work done by the system during vaporization is the expansion work at constant pressure. The initial volume of water is \(1 \, \text{cm}^3\) and the final volume of steam is \(1671 \, \text{cm}^3\). Thus, the change in volume is:
   \[
   \Delta V = 1671 \, \text{cm}^3 - 1 \, \text{cm}^3 = 1670 \, \text{cm}^3 = 1.67 \, \text{L}.
   \]
   At 1 atm pressure, the work done is:
   \[
   W = P \Delta V = 1 \, \text{atm} \times 1.67 \, \text{L} = 1.67 \, \text{L·atm}.
   \]
   Converting \(1 \, \text{L·atm}\) to calories (\(1 \, \text{L·atm} \approx 24.71 \, \text{cal}\)):
   \[
   W = 1.67 \times 24.71 \approx 41.26 \, \text{cal} \approx 41 \, \text{cal}.
   \]

3. **Change in Internal Energy (\(\Delta U\)):** Using the first law of thermodynamics:
   \[
   \Delta U = Q - W = 539 \, \text{cal} - 41 \, \text{cal} = 498 \, \text{cal}.
   \]

Thus, the external work done is \(41 \, \text{cal}\), and the increase in internal energy is \(498 \, \text{cal}\). The correct option is:

**E: External work: 41 cal, Increase in internal energy: 498 cal.**
