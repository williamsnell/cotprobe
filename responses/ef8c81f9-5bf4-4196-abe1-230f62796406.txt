Question:

Earth's atmosphere is constantly bombarded by cosmic ray protons that originate somewhere in space.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about cosmic ray protons bombarding Earth's atmosphere. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. 

The question says that each square meter of Earth's surface intercepts protons at an average rate of 1500 protons per second. I need to find the total electric current intercepted by the entire planet. 

First, I remember that electric current is the rate of flow of charge. So, I should probably calculate the total charge per second (which is current) that's hitting the Earth. 

Wait, but protons are positively charged particles. Each proton has a charge equal to the elementary charge, right? So, each proton carries a charge of +e, where e is approximately 1.6 x 10^-19 coulombs. 

So, the plan is: find the total number of protons hitting the Earth every second, multiply that by the charge per proton to get the total current.

But wait, the problem mentions the rate per square meter. So I need to find the total surface area of Earth and then multiply that by the proton rate per square meter. 

Earth's surface area is a sphere, so the formula is 4πr². What's Earth's radius? I think it's about 6,371 kilometers, so 6.371 x 10^6 meters. 

Calculating Earth's surface area: 4 * π * (6.371e6)^2. Let me compute that. 

Wait, I can approximate this. Let me compute 6.371e6 squared first. 6.371^2 is about 40.58, so (6.371e6)^2 is 40.58e12. Multiply by 4π: 4 * π ≈ 12.566. So 12.566 * 40.58e12 ≈ 509.8e12 m². So Earth's surface area is approximately 5.098e14 m². Let me double-check that calculation because I might have messed up the exponents. Wait, 6.371e6 squared is (6.371)^2 * 1e12, which is about 40.58 * 1e12, so 4.058e13. Then 4 * π * 4.058e13 = 4 * 3.1416 * 4.058e13 ≈ 5.098e14 m². Yeah, that seems right.

Now, each square meter gets 1500 protons per second. So the total number of protons per second hitting the Earth is 1500 protons/m²/s * 5.098e14 m². Let me calculate that: 1500 * 5.098e14 = 7.647e17 protons per second.

Each proton has a charge of +1.6e-19 coulombs. So the total current is the number of protons per second multiplied by the charge per proton. So that's 7.647e17 protons/s * 1.6e-19 C/proton.

Let me compute that: 7.647e17 * 1.6e-19 = (7.647 * 1.6) * 1e-2. 7.647 * 1.6 is approximately 12.235. So 12.235e-2 A, which is 0.12235 A. Since 1 A is 1000 mA, this is 0.12235 * 1000 = 122.35 mA. 

Looking at the options, option F is 122 mA. So that must be the answer. 

Wait, let me just check if I made any mistakes. Did I use the right radius? Yes, 6.371e6 m. Did I calculate the surface area correctly? 4πr², yes. Did I multiply 1500 by the surface area correctly? Yes, 1500 * 5.098e14 is 7.647e17. Then multiplied by 1.6e-19, that gives 1.2235e-1 A, which is 122.35 mA. So yeah, option F is the correct choice.

To determine the electric current intercepted by Earth's surface due to cosmic ray protons, we start by calculating the total number of protons hitting the planet per second. The proton rate is 1500 protons per square meter per second, and Earth's surface area is approximately \(4\pi r^2\), where \(r = 6.371 \times 10^6 \, \text{m}\). 

The surface area is calculated as:
\[
4\pi (6.371 \times 10^6)^2 \approx 5.098 \times 10^{14} \, \text{m}^2
\]

Multiplying this by the proton rate gives the total protons per second:
\[
1500 \, \text{protons/m}^2/\text{s} \times 5.098 \times 10^{14} \, \text{m}^2 = 7.647 \times 10^{17} \, \text{protons/s}
\]

Each proton carries a charge of \(1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}\). The total current is:
\[
7.647 \times 10^{17} \, \text{protons/s} \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C/proton} = 0.12235 \, \text{A} = 122.35 \, \text{mA}
\]

The closest option is **F: 122 mA**.
