Okay, so I need to solve this economics problem. Let me read it carefully again. The question is about consumption and savings based on the marginal propensity to consume and the break-even point. Hmm, I remember that the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is the fraction of additional income that a household consumes. In this case, it's given as 1/2, so MPC = 0.5. 

The break-even point is $8,000. I think the break-even point is the level of income at which consumption equals income. So, any income above that point, people will save the excess. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The break-even point is the income level where people just break even, meaning they don't save or consume beyond that. So, when income is exactly at the break-even point, their savings would be zero. If income is higher than the break-even point, they save the amount above it.

Given that, income here is $10,000, which is higher than the break-even point of $8,000. So, the excess is $2,000 ($10k - $8k). Since MPC is 1/2, I think the saving rate is also 1/2 because MPC plus the marginal propensity to save (MPS) equals 1. So, MPS = 1 - MPC = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5. 

Wait, so if the MPC is 0.5, then the MPS is 0.5 as well. That means for every dollar earned above the break-even point, 0.5 is saved. So, the excess income is $2,000. Therefore, savings would be 0.5 * $2,000 = $1,000. 

Now, consumption is calculated as the break-even point plus the MPC times the excess income. So, consumption = break-even + (MPC * (income - break-even)). Plugging in the numbers: $8,000 + (0.5 * $2,000) = $8,000 + $1,000 = $9,000. 

So, consumption is $9,000 and savings are $1,000. Looking at the options, option F says consumption is $9,000 and $1,000 is saved. That matches what I calculated. 

I should double-check to make sure I didn't mix up any concepts. Break-even point is where income equals consumption, so if income is higher, savings are positive. The MPC determines how much of the extra income is consumed, which in this case is half, so savings are the other half. Yep, that makes sense. So the answer should be option F.

The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is 0.5, meaning half of additional income is consumed. The break-even point is $8,000, so at this income level, consumption equals income. With an income of $10,000, the excess income is $2,000. Since MPC is 0.5, consumption increases by $1,000 (0.5 * $2,000), making total consumption $9,000. Savings are the remaining $1,000.
