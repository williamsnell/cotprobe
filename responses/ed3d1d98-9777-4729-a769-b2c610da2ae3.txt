Alright, so I've got this question about tort law, specifically dealing with assault and battery. Let me break it down step by step.

The scenario is that Donny throws a knife at Sally with the intent to injure her severely. However, he misses. Sally sees the knife whizz by her head, missing by about an inch, and gets very scared. She then sues Donny for assault and battery.

I need to figure out which of the options A through J is correct. Let me recall what assault and battery mean in tort law.

Battery is typically defined as intentional harmful or offensive contact with another person. It requires that the contact is both intentional and causes some harm or is offensive. However, in some jurisdictions, even a harmful result isn't necessary if the contact was intentional and offensive. But importantly, the contact must actually happen. So if Donny threw the knife but missed, there's no physical contact. Therefore, battery might not apply here because the contact didn't occur.

Assault, on the other hand, is the intentional creation of a reasonable apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact. It doesn't require actual contact, just the fear of it. So even if Donny missed Sally, if she reasonably feared that she was about to be hit, that could constitute assault.

In this case, Donny intended to injure Sally, and the act of throwing the knife created a situation where Sally could reasonably fear imminent harm. Since the knife missed her by an inch, there was no contact, so battery wouldn't apply. But the act still caused her fear, which is the essence of assault.

Looking at the options:

A: Battery but not assault. But since there was no contact, battery shouldn't apply. So A is incorrect.

B: Not liable for either because he didn't hit her. Well, he did intend to cause apprehension, so B is incorrect because he is liable for assault.

C: Assault but not battery because he missed. That makes sense because there's no contact for battery, but assault applies due to the fear.

D: Liable for both. No, because no contact for battery.

E: Not liable because it's criminal. No, tort liability doesn't depend on criminal charges. So E is wrong.

F: Not liable because no physical harm. But assault doesn't require physical harm, just the apprehension. So F is incorrect.

G: Liable for both because intent to harm. But again, no contact, so battery isn't there. G is wrong.

H: Liable for both because she was terrified. But no contact, so no battery. H is incorrect.

I: Liable for battery but not assault because she dodged. Wait, she didn't dodge; the knife missed. So no contact for battery, but she was scared, so assault applies. I is wrong because it's the opposite.

J: Liable for assault but not battery. That aligns with what I thought earlier.

So the correct answer should be J.

The correct answer is J: Donny will be liable for assault, but not battery.
