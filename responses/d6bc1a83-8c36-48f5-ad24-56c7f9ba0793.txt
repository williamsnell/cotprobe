Question:

 Which of the following statements best describes Gill's response to the argument that the Oregon physician-assisted law falsely assumes that doctors are qualified to judge whether a life is worth living?

Options:

A: Doctors are normally required to make life-and-death decisions, and this is no exception.
B: The law is in line with the doctors' Hippocratic oath of doing no harm.
C: Doctors are as qualified as any other mature adult to decide whether a life is worth living.
D: The law doesn't require doctors to judge the worth of a life, but rather to provide a professional opinion on the patient's condition.
E: The argument is valid because doctors should not be the ones to decide whether a life is worth living.
F: The law is justified as doctors are inherently equipped to make such judgements due to their profession.
G: The law only requires doctors to make medical decisions about the patient's life expectancy and prognosis.
H: The argument is self-defeating because it was proposed by medical doctors.
I: The argument is irrelevant as the law is about patient autonomy and not about doctors' judgement on life's worth.
J: The law is flawed because it puts too much pressure on the doctors to make such decisions.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this multiple-choice question. The question is about Gill's response to an argument against the Oregon physician-assisted suicide law. The argument in question is that the law falsely assumes doctors are qualified to judge whether a life is worth living.

First, I need to understand what each option is saying and how it relates to the argument. Let me break down each option one by one.

Option A: Doctors are normally required to make life-and-death decisions, and this is no exception. So this is saying that doctors already make such decisions, so this law isn't different. Maybe Gill would agree, but I'm not sure if that's his point.

Option B: The law aligns with the Hippocratic Oath of doing no harm. The Hippocratic Oath is about not causing harm, but the argument isn't about harm; it's about whether doctors are qualified to judge life's worth. So B might not be the best fit.

Option C: Doctors are as qualified as any other mature adult to decide whether a life is worth living. This suggests that doctors are just as qualified as others, which might counter the argument, but I'm not sure if that's Gill's position.

Option D: The law doesn't require doctors to judge the worth of a life, but rather to provide a professional opinion on the patient's condition. This seems to address the argument directly by clarifying the scope of the doctors' role. So the law isn't about judging the worth of life but giving medical opinions on prognosis.

Option E: The argument is valid because doctors shouldn't decide whether a life is worth living. This supports the argument against the law, which seems opposite of what Gill would say if he's defending the law.

Option F: The law is justified because doctors are equipped to make such judgments due to their profession. This is similar to option A but more specific. It justifies the law by asserting doctors' qualifications, which might be what Gill argues.

Option G: The law only requires doctors to make medical decisions about life expectancy and prognosis. This is similar to D but focuses more on the medical aspects rather than the worth of life. It clarifies that doctors' role is limited to medical aspects.

Option H: The argument is self-defeating because it was proposed by medical doctors. This seems a bit ad hominem and might not be the strongest argument. Probably not the best fit.

Option I: The argument is irrelevant because the law is about patient autonomy, not doctors' judgment on life's worth. This shifts focus to patient choice rather than the doctors' role, which could be a way to dismiss the argument.

Option J: The law is flawed because it puts too much pressure on doctors. This is a different criticism, focusing on the stress on doctors, not their qualifications.

Now, considering the argument is that the law falsely assumes doctors are qualified to judge life's worth. Gill is likely responding to counter this. So he needs to clarify that the law doesn't require such a judgment.

Looking at the options, both D and G seem relevant. D says the law doesn't require judging worth but provides a professional opinion on the patient's condition. G says the law only requires medical decisions on life expectancy and prognosis.

Wait, the question is about whether doctors are qualified to judge whether a life is worth living. So the argument is that they're not qualified. Gill's response would clarify that the law doesn't require that judgment, so the argument is moot.

Option D says the law doesn't require judging the worth but to provide a professional opinion on the patient's condition. So it's about the scope of the law.

Option G is more about the content of the opinionâ€”focusing on life expectancy and prognosis, which are medical aspects, not the value judgment.

So, the argument is that the law assumes doctors can judge if a life is worth living. If Gill responds that the law doesn't require that judgment but only their professional opinion on the patient's condition, that would directly address the argument.

Therefore, the correct answer is D.

The correct answer is D because it directly addresses the argument by clarifying that the law does not require doctors to judge the worth of a life but instead seeks their professional opinion on the patient's condition.
