Question:

An action potential arriving at the motor endplate causes release of:

Options:

A: adrenaline which speeds up muscle metabolism.
B: noradrenaline which increases muscle metabolic activity.
C: sodium ions which binds to sodium receptors on the muscle membrane.
D: acetylcholine which traverses the neuromuscular junction.
E: acetylcholine which is broken down by acetylcholinesterase in the synaptic cleft.
F: calcium ions which initiate an action potential along the muscle fibre.
G: dopamine which initiates muscle contraction.
H: serotonin which reduces muscle excitability.
I: potassium ions which hyperpolarize the muscle membrane.
J: glutamate which acts as a neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular junction.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the neuromuscular junction and how an action potential leads to muscle contraction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question is asking what happens when an action potential arrives at the motor endplate. The options are A through J, each suggesting a different chemical or ion. I remember that the motor endplate is part of the neuromuscular junction, where the axon terminal of a neuron connects to the muscle fiber.

So, when the action potential reaches the motor endplate, the neuron's axon terminal releases a neurotransmitter. From what I studied, the primary neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular junction is acetylcholine. The action potential causes the voltage-dependent calcium channels to open, allowing calcium ions to flow into the axon terminal. This influx of calcium triggers the release of acetylcholine vesicles into the synaptic cleft.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option D says acetylcholine traverses the neuromuscular junction. That makes sense because acetylcholine diffuses across the synaptic cleft to the muscle membrane. But wait, what about option E? It says acetylcholine is broken down by acetylcholinesterase. That's true too because after the acetylcholine has done its job, the enzyme breaks it down to terminate the signal. But the question is about what is released upon arrival of the action potential, so E is about the breakdown after release, not the initial release.

Options A, B, G, and H are about other neurotransmitters like adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin. Those are more associated with other parts of the nervous system, not the neuromuscular junction. For example, adrenaline is released from the adrenal glands, not neurons at the muscle.

Option C mentions sodium ions binding to receptors. Wait, sodium ions are involved in the action potential itself, but in the muscle fiber, sodium influx occurs during the depolarization. However, when the action potential arrives at the motor endplate, the release is about neurotransmitter, not sodium directly binding. So C might not be the right choice.

Option F says calcium ions initiate an action along the muscle fibre. I think that's part of the muscle contraction process after the acetylcholine has bound. The calcium release within the muscle fiber (from the sarcoplasmic reticulum) is what causes the muscle contraction, but that's after the initial release of acetylcholine.

Option I is potassium ions causing hyperpolarization. That's part of the repolarization phase of the action potential in the neuron, but again, the question is about what's released at the motor endplate.

Option J suggests glutamate as a neurotransmitter. No, I'm pretty sure glutamate is more involved in synaptic transmission in the brain, not the neuromuscular junction.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be D: acetylcholine which traverses the neuromuscular junction. Because when the action potential arrives, the neuron releases acetylcholine, which then crosses the junction to the muscle membrane.

The action potential arriving at the motor endplate triggers the release of acetylcholine, which then crosses the neuromuscular junction to initiate muscle contraction.

Answer: D
