Okay, so I need to figure out what letters are on the '3' button of a touch-tone telephone. Hmm, I remember that old telephone keypads have letters assigned to each number. Let me try to visualize the layout.

I think the numbers go from 1 to 9, and each has some letters. The 1 button usually has nothing or just maybe a letter like Q or Z, but I'm not sure. Then 2 is ABC, 3 comes next. I remember that 3 is associated with some letters. Wait, was it DEF? Or maybe TUV? No, wait, no, that's on 8. Let me think again.

On the old phone keypad, the layout is like this: 

1 has nothing or maybe just one letter, 2 is ABC, 3 is DEF, 4 is GHI, 5 is JKL, 6 is MNO, 7 is PQRS, 8 is TUV, and 9 is WXYZ. Then 0 is just 0. So, the 3 button should have DEF. Wait, but looking at the options, option H is DEF. So the answer should be H. But let me double-check because sometimes I get confused with the order.

Wait, another way to remember: On a phone, 2 is ABC, 3 is DEF, 4 is GHI, 5 is JKL, 6 is MNO, 7 is PQRS, 8 is TUV, 9 is WXYZ. Yeah, that seems right. So 3 is DEF, which is option H. So the correct answer is H.

The letters on the '3' button of a touch-tone telephone are DEF, which corresponds to option H.
