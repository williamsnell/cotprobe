Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem about reducing agents. The question asks me to arrange the substances Al, Co, Ni, Ag, H₂, and Na in decreasing order of their ability as reducing agents. I remember that the strength of a reducing agent is related to the standard reduction potentials. The more likely a substance is to be oxidized, the better it is as a reducing agent.

First, I need to recall the standard electrode potentials (E°) for each of these substances. The more negative the E°, the stronger the reducing agent because it means the substance tends to lose electrons (get oxidized) more readily.

Let me list out each substance and their standard reduction potentials:

- Aluminum (Al): I think Al has a very low E°. Looking back, I remember that metals like Al are strong reducing agents because they oxidize easily. For Al³+ + 3e⁻ → Al, the E° is around -1.66 V.

- Cobalt (Co): The Co²+ + 2e⁻ → Co has an E° of about -0.28 V. So Co is a better reducing agent than something with a higher E° but worse than something with a lower E°.

- Nickel (Ni): The reaction Ni²+ + 2e⁻ → Ni has an E° of around -0.26 V. Wait, that's actually higher than Co, so Co is a better reducing agent than Ni? No, wait, because E° for reduction, lower (more negative) E° means better reducing agent. So if Co is -0.28 and Ni is -0.26, Co is a better reducing agent than Ni because it's more likely to be oxidized.

Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Let me double-check. The standard reduction potentials: the more positive the E°, the stronger the oxidizing agent. So for reducing agents, the lower (more negative) the E°, the stronger the reducing agent. So higher E° means stronger oxidizing agent, lower means stronger reducing agent.

So the order of E° (reduction potential) from highest (good oxidizing agents) to lowest (good reducing agents) is:

- H₂: The reaction is 2H+ + 2e⁻ → H₂(g). The E° is about 0 V (by definition, it's the reference point).

- Ag: Ag+ + e⁻ → Ag(s), E° is +0.80 V. So Ag is a strong oxidizing agent and a poor reducing agent.

- Na: Na+ + e⁻ → Na(s), E° is about -2.71 V. That's very low, so Na is a strong reducing agent.

- Al: As I thought, E° is -1.66 V.

- Co: E° is -0.28 V.

- Ni: E° is -0.26 V.

Wait, so arranging the E° values from highest (most oxidizing) to lowest (most reducing):

Ag (+0.80 V) > H₂ (0 V) > Ni (-0.26 V) > Co (-0.28 V) > Al (-1.66 V) > Na (-2.71 V).

Wait, that can't be right because Co's E° is -0.28 and Ni's is -0.26. So Ni has a higher E° than Co, which makes Ni a weaker reducing agent than Co because it's less likely to be oxidized.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The reducing agent is the one that gets oxidized. The more negative the E°, the more likely the substance is to be oxidized, meaning it's a better reducing agent.

So the order from strongest to weakest reducing agents (from lowest E° to higher E°) should be:

Na (-2.71) > Al (-1.66) > Co (-0.28) > Ni (-0.26) > H₂ (0) > Ag (+0.80).

Wait, but wait. H₂ is at 0, which is higher than Ni's -0.26. So in terms of reducing strength, the order would be Na > Al > Co > Ni > H₂ > Ag.

Wait, but let me check the actual E° values again to make sure I'm not mixing them up.

Looking up standard E° values (approximate):

- Ag⁺ + e⁻ → Ag: +0.80 V
- H⁺ + e⁻ → ½ H₂: 0 V (by definition)
- Na⁺ + e⁻ → Na: -2.71 V
- Al³+ + 3e⁻ → Al: -1.66 V
- Co²+ + 2e⁻ → Co: -0.28 V
- Ni²+ + 2e⁻ → Ni: -0.26 V

So arranging them from most negative (strongest reducing agent) to least negative (weakest reducing agent):

Na (-2.71) > Al (-1.66) > Co (-0.28) > Ni (-0.26) > H₂ (0) > Ag (+0.80).

Wait, but H₂ is at 0, which is higher than Ni's -0.26. So in the order, H₂ comes after Ni because Ni is a better reducing agent than H₂. So the order is:

Na > Al > Co > Ni > H₂ > Ag.

Now, looking at the options:

Option I: Na > Al > Co > Ni > H₂ > Ag. That's exactly what I have.

Wait, let me check the options again. The options are labeled A to J.

Option I: Na > Al > Co > Ni > H₂ > Ag. Yes, that matches.

So the correct order is Na, Al, Co, Ni, H₂, Ag. So the answer should be option I.

The correct answer is I: Na > Al > Co > Ni > H₂ > Ag.
