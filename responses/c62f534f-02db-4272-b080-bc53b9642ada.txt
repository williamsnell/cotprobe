Okay, so I've got this question about structural family therapy and how a family is described based on their behavior. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: A 14-year-old boy is arrested for the third time for shoplifting. His mother doesn't seem worried and says, "he's just going through a phase." The father decides to go fishing on the court hearing day, and the sister can't attend because she has too much homework.

I remember that structural family therapy looks at the family's interactions and structure. The key concepts I've studied before include things like enmeshment, disengagement, codependency, etc. So I need to figure out which term fits best here.

Let's think about each family member's response. The mother is minimally concerned, trivializing the situation. The father is choosing fishing over supporting the son during a court hearing, which is a significant event. The sister is also not attending, citing homework as the reason. 

This seems like the family is not showing much support or concern. The mother is dismissive, the father is absent, and the sister isn't there either. In structural family therapy terms, when family members don't engage with each other's issues and show little emotional support, that's called disengagement.

Wait, what's the difference between disengaged and emotionally cut-off? I think disengaged refers more to the lack of involvement in each other's lives, while emotionally cut-off might be more about emotional distance. But in this case, the family isn't just distant emotionally; they're not involved at all in the son's problem.

So looking at the options, C is disengaged, and G is emotionally cut-off. I think disengaged fits better here because the family isn't stepping in to help or support. They're each focusing on their own things, like the father with fishing and the sister with homework, leaving the boy alone.

Other options: Enmeshed families are too involved, which isn't the case here. Codependent is more about dependency, which isn't exactly what's happening. Supportive is the opposite of what's happening. Triangulated usually involves one person mediating conflicts, which I don't see here. Skewed might imply imbalance, but not the main issue. Conflict-avoidant is when they avoid arguments, but again, this isn't the primary issue here.

So putting it all together, the family's behavior shows a lack of involvement and support, which aligns with being disengaged.

The family's behavior demonstrates a lack of involvement and support for the少年, with each member focusing on their own activities instead of addressing the boy's issues. This aligns with the concept of being disengaged in structural family therapy.

Answer: C
