Okay, so I have this problem here about designing a bar to resist pure tension. Let me try to figure this out step by step. The question is asking which of the options (A to D) is the correct design based on the given parameters.

First, let's understand what's given. The bar needs to resist a pure tension force of 4,000 pounds. The factor of safety is 2.5, and the tensile strength of the material is 175 psi. 

Hmm, I think the key here is to calculate the required area of the bar using the given tension force and the factor of safety. Then, compare it with the areas provided in the options to find the suitable one.

I remember that the factor of safety (FS) is used to ensure that the design doesn't fail under the applied load. The formula I think I should use is: 

Safe Stress = Tensile Strength / Factor of Safety.

So, the safe stress would be 175 psi divided by 2.5. Let me calculate that: 175 / 2.5 = 70 psi. Okay, so the maximum allowable stress the bar can have is 70 psi.

Next, I need to find the required area (A) of the bar. The formula for stress (σ) is force (F) divided by area (A), so rearranging that, Area = Force / Stress. 

The force here is 4,000 lb., and the stress is 70 psi. So, Area = 4000 / 70. Let me do that math: 4000 ÷ 70 is approximately 57.14 square inches.

Now, I need to calculate the area for each of the given options to see which one meets or exceeds this required area of 57.14 sq.in.

Looking at the options:

A: 14 in. × 3 in. That's 14*3 = 42 sq.in.
B: 16 in. ×4 in. 16*4=64 sq.in.
C: 18 in. ×6 in. 18*6=108 sq.in.
D:15 in. ×5 in. 15*5=75 sq.in.

Wait, so the required area is about 57.14. So option A is 42, which is less than required, so that's not good. B is 64, which is more than enough. C is way higher, and D is 75, which is also sufficient.

But wait, the question is about which bar to choose. So we need the area to be at least 57.14. So options B, C, D all meet that. But wait, maybe I made a mistake because sometimes in such problems, you might need to consider the minimum area required, but perhaps the question expects the minimal area that meets the requirement, or perhaps I need to check if the stress is within the allowed limit.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the calculations. Let me recalculate the area required.

Stress allowed: 70 psi.

Force is 4,000 lb. So area = 4000 /70 ≈ 57.14 sq.in.

So any bar with area ≥57.14 is acceptable.

So looking at the options:

A: 42 <57.14 → Not enough.

B:64>57.14 → Okay.

C:108>57.14 → Okay.

D:75>57.14 → Okay.

So the question is, which of these options is the correct bar? The options are A to D, but all except A are acceptable. Wait, but the options are given as four choices, and the question is to choose the correct one. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Stress allowed: 175 /2.5 =70 psi. Correct.

Area required: 4000 /70 ≈57.14. Right.

So the bar must have an area of at least 57.14. So options B, C, D are all acceptable. But the question is to choose the correct one, implying only one is correct. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the bar is designed as a rod or a beam, but the options are given as length × width. Wait, but in that case, perhaps the area is correct, but the shape matters. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to calculate the minimum dimension, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the factor of safety is applied differently. Wait, sometimes factor of safety is applied to the design stress, so perhaps I did it correctly. Alternatively, maybe I should have used the formula as Area = Force/(Stress * FS). Wait, no, because the formula is Stress = Force/Area, and then we apply the factor of safety to the stress.

Wait, another approach: The bar's actual stress under the applied load should not exceed the allowable stress. So allowable stress is 70 psi. So the area must be >= 4000 /70 ≈57.14.

So any option where the area is ≥57.14 is acceptable. So options B, C, D fit. But the options provided have B as 16x4=64, which is the first one that meets the requirement. So perhaps the correct answer is B.

Wait, but let me check the options again:

A:14x3=42 → too small.

B:16x4=64 → sufficient.

C:18x6=108 → more than enough.

D:15x5=75 → also sufficient.

So why are multiple options acceptable? But the question is to select one, so perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the bar is in tension along one of its dimensions. For example, if the bar is rectangular, the area is length × width. So in that case, the dimensions are given as length × width, and the area is correct.

But perhaps the problem is that the bar is designed to have a certain shape, but the area is the main consideration. So the correct answer is the minimal area that meets the requirement, which would be option B with 64, which is the first one that's above 57.14.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the area to be exactly 57.14, but that's not possible with the given options. So the minimal area is B.

Wait, but let me think again. The stress allowed is 70 psi. So the bar's area must be at least 57.14. So the options are:

B:64 → 64 is the next after A (42), which is too small.

So the correct answer must be B.

Wait, but another angle: perhaps the factor of safety is applied differently. For example, sometimes the formula is used as:

Area = (Force * FS) / Tensile Strength.

Wait, let's see: Area = (4000 lb * 2.5) / 175 psi.

So that would be (10,000) /175 ≈57.14 sq.in. Same as before.

So the area must be at least 57.14. So again, B, C, D are acceptable.

But the options are presented as A to D. So perhaps the answer is B, as it's the first one that meets the requirement.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects that the bar is the minimal one that meets the requirement, which is B.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps the question expects that the bar's area is exactly 57.14, but that's not possible with the given options. So the next possible is B:64.

So I think the correct answer is B:16x4.

To design a bar to resist pure tension of 4000 lb. with a factor of safety of 2.5 and a tensile strength of 175 psi, the following steps are taken:

1. **Calculate the allowable stress**:  
   \[
   \text{Allowable Stress} = \frac{\text{Tensile Strength}}{\text{Factor of Safety}} = \frac{175 \, \text{psi}}{2.5} = 70 \, \text{psi}.
   \]

2. **Determine the required area**:  
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{\text{Force}}{\text{Stress}} = \frac{4000 \, \text{lb}}{70 \, \text{psi}} \approx 57.14 \, \text{sq.in}.
   \]

3. **Compare with the given options**:  
   - **A**: \(14 \, \text{in.} \times 3 \, \text{in.} = 42 \, \text{sq.in.}\) (Insufficient, as it is less than 57.14).  
   - **B**: \(16 \, \text{in.} \times 4 \, \text{in.} = 64 \, \text{sq.in.}\) (Sufficient, as it is greater than 57.14).  
   - **C**: \(18 \, \text{in.} \times 6 \, \text{in.} = 108 \, \text{sq.in.}\) (Sufficient, as it is greater than 57.14).  
   - **D**: \(15 \, \text{in.} \times 5 \, \text{in.} = 75 \, \text{sq.in.}\) (Sufficient, as it is greater than 57.14).

4. **Select the appropriate option**:  
   While options B, C, and D all meet the requirement, option B is the first one that satisfies the condition and is the minimal area that meets the requirement.

Answer: B
