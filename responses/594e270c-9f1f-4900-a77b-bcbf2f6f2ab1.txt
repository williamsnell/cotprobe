Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about accounting standards, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully. 

The question is about a practitioner who needs to express an opinion on management's assertion regarding the square footage of a warehouse. Specifically, the warehouse is being offered for sale, and the assertion is that it's 150,000 square feet. The task is to determine which source the practitioner should refer to for professional guidance.

The options are A through J, each listing different types of Statements on Standards. I'm a bit rusty on the exact purposes of each, so I'll need to think through each one.

First, let me break down what the question is asking. The practitioner is expressing an opinion on a specific assertion made by management. This sounds like an attestation engagement because the practitioner is providing a formal opinion on a subject matter (in this case, the square footage) that's being presented by management. Attestation engagements involve the practitioner gathering evidence and providing a conclusion or opinion on the subject matter. 

Now, looking at the options, I need to find which set of standards applies to attestation engagements. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Statements on Standards for Personal Financial Planning Services (PFP). These would relate to providing financial planning advice to individuals, not to giving opinions on assertions made by management about a business's measurements. So probably not A.

Option B: Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services. These are related to review engagements, which are less involved than audits. They provide a limited assurance on financial statements, but I'm not sure if they cover specific assertions like this. Maybe, but let's keep going.

Option C: Statements on Standards for Financial Advisory Services. This would cover things like financial consulting, advice, or valuation services. The question is about expressing an opinion, which seems more like an attestation rather than advisory, so maybe not C.

Option D: Statements on Standards for Forensic Accounting Services. These relate to investigations and dispute resolutions, perhaps in legal contexts. The question is about a sale and an assertion, but unless there's a dispute, this might not be the right fit.

Option E: Statements on Standards for Information Technology Services. This would involve IT-related services like system implementations or security audits. Not directly related to measuring physical spaces, so probably not E.

Option F: Statements on Standards for Tax Services. These relate to tax compliance, planning, and advisory services. The square footage might affect tax assessments, but the question is about expressing an opinion on the assertion itself, not the tax implications, so F might not be it.

Option G: Statements on Standards for Consulting Services. Consulting is about providing advice to help achieve business objectives. Again, the question is about giving an opinion on a specific assertion, which leans more towards attestation than consulting.

Option H: Statements on Auditing Standards. Auditing standards are for audits of financial statements. While audits do involve expressing opinions, they're typically about the overall truth and fairness of financial statements, not about specific assertions like measurements unless it's part of a larger audit. But the question is specifically about the square footage, which seems more like a direct attestation.

Option I: Statements on Standards for Business Valuation Services. Business valuation is about determining the value of a business or its components. While square footage might be a factor in valuation, the question is about an opinion on the measurement, not the valuation itself. So maybe not I.

Option J: Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements. This seems directly relevant because attestation engagements involve the practitioner providing a written statement on a subject matter (like the assertion here) based on evidence. The standards for attestation engagements would provide guidance on how to conduct such engagements, including expressing an opinion on management's assertion.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be J because the practitioner is performing an attestation engagement by expressing an opinion on management's assertion.
