Okay, I need to answer this question about Piaget's theory of cognitive development. The question is asking when the stages described by Piaget occur, and I have to choose the correct option from A to J.

First, I remember that Piaget proposed four main stages of cognitive development. Let me think about what those stages are. I believe they are the Sensorimotor stage, Preoperational stage, Concrete Operational stage, and Formal Operational stage. Each of these stages occurs at different times in a person's life.

The Sensorimotor stage is from birth up to about 2 years old. During this time, babies learn through their senses and motor activities. Next is the Preoperational stage, which lasts from about 2 to 7 years. Here, kids start using language and pretend play but lack logical reasoning. Then comes the Concrete Operational stage, around 7 to 11 years. At this point, children can think logically about concrete events. Finally, the Formal Operational stage starts at around 11 or 12 and continues into adulthood. This stage involves abstract and hypothetical thinking.

So Piaget's stages start from birth and go through adulthood, but do they cover the entire lifespan? I think the Formal Operational stage continues into adulthood, so Piaget's theory covers cognitive development from infancy all the way through to adulthood, but not necessarily late adulthood. Wait, I'm not sure if he extended it all the way to late adulthood. I think he focused more on childhood and adolescence, but I'm not certain.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. Option A says during adolescence only—that's too narrow because the stages start much earlier. Option B is from birth to late childhood only—doesn't include the later stages into adolescence and beyond. Option C is during infancy only, which is way too limited. Option D is from birth to early adulthood only. That might cover up to the Formal Operational stage, which is in early adulthood. Option E is from infancy through adolescence only, which would stop before early adulthood. Option F is from early childhood to late adulthood only, which might not cover the early stages like sensorimotor. Option G is during early childhood only—too limited. Option H is throughout the lifespan, which would mean it goes all the way to old age, but I'm not sure if Piaget's theory extends that far. Option I is from adolescence to early adulthood only, which misses the earlier stages. Option J is from birth through late adolescence only, so that would include up to late teens but not into early adulthood.

Wait, I think Piaget's theory stops around early adulthood because the Formal Operational stage begins in adolescence and continues into adulthood. So the stages go from birth through early adulthood. That would make option D correct because it says from birth to early adulthood only. But I'm a bit confused because I thought some sources say cognitive development continues beyond that, but Piaget's original theory might not cover late adulthood. Alternatively, some might consider his theory to cover up to adolescence, but I'm pretty sure it goes beyond.

Another angle: the question is about the stages being described by Piaget. He didn't include stages beyond formal operations. So the stages are from birth through early adulthood. So the correct option would be D, from birth to early adulthood only. Alternatively, if the theory is considered to cover up to late adolescence, that's option J. But I think D is more accurate because formal operations start in adolescence and go into adulthood.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. Option D is "From birth to early adulthood only." That seems to include all four stages. The Formal Operational stage ends at early adulthood, so yes, that's correct. So the answer should be D.
