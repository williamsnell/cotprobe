Okay, so I have this question about calculating abnormal return. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the question gives me some data: Rf is 4%, Rm is 12%, beta is 1.8. The portfolio's beginning value is $50,000 and ending at $60,000. I need to find the abnormal return.

First, I remember that abnormal return is the actual return minus the expected return. So I need to calculate both.

The actual return is straightforward. The portfolio went from $50k to $60k. So the return is (Ending - Beginning)/Beginning. Let me compute that: (60,000 - 50,000)/50,000 = 10,000/50,000 = 0.2, which is 20%. Wait, but wait a minute, is that correct? Yes, because the change is $10k on a $50k investment, so 20% gain.

Next, the expected return. The expected return is calculated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). The formula is Expected Return = Rf + Beta*(Rm - Rf). Let me plug in the numbers: Rf is 4%, Rm is 12%, beta is 1.8.

So, Expected Return = 4% + 1.8*(12% - 4%). Let me compute the part in the parentheses first: 12% minus 4% is 8%. Multiply that by beta, which is 1.8: 1.8 * 8% = 14.4%. Now add Rf: 4% + 14.4% = 18.4%. So the expected return is 18.4%.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because the actual return is 20%, which is higher than the expected 18.4%. So the abnormal return would be 20% - 18.4% = 1.6%. But let me double-check my calculations to avoid any mistakes.

Let me recalculate the expected return. Rf is 4%, Rm is 12%, beta is 1.8. So CAPM is 4 + 1.8*(12-4). 12-4 is 8, 1.8*8=14.4, plus 4 is 18.4. Yep, that's correct.

So the actual return is 20%, expected is 18.4%, so abnormal return is 1.6%. Wait, but looking at the options, I need to see which one matches 1.6%. Let's look at the options again.

The options are A:0.025, B:0.035, C:0.016, D:0.012, E:0.030, F:0.040, G:0.008, H:0.010, I:0.020, J:0.050.

Wait, 1.6% is 0.016 in decimal. Oh, right, because 1% is 0.01, so 1.6% is 0.016. So the abnormal return is 0.016, which is option C.

Wait a second, but wait another thing. Did I compute the actual return correctly? The portfolio's return is (Ending - Beginning)/Beginning. So 60,000 - 50,000 is 10,000. 10,000/50,000 is 0.2, which is 20%, right. So that seems correct.

I think I'm confident that the abnormal return is 1.6%, which is 0.016, so option C.
</think>

The abnormal return is calculated as the actual return minus the expected return. The actual return is 20%, and the expected return using CAPM is 18.4%. Subtracting these gives an abnormal return of 1.6%, which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
