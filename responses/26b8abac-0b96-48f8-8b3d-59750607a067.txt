Okay, so I need to figure out which of Freud's stages corresponds to Erikson's Initiative vs. Guilt stage. Hmm, I remember that Erikson developed his theory of psychosocial development, which has eight stages. Each of his stages is related to a specific age range and a conflict that needs to be resolved.

Erikson's Initiative vs. Guilt stage is the third one, I think. It's about children learning to initiative actions and develop a sense of purpose, while dealing with guilt if they don't handle this well. This is typically during the preschool years, maybe around 3 to 5 years old.

Now, looking at Freud's stages, he had the oral, anal, phallic, and genital stages. The genital stage is the last one, dealing with puberty and beyond. The phallic stage is around the same time as the Initiative vs. Guilt stage, I believe. The phallic stage in Freud's theory is when children are toilet training, which is around 18 months to 3 years. Wait, but that's a bit earlier than the preschool years. Maybe I'm mixing up the timings.

Wait, no, the phallic stage is actually from about 3 to 6 years, which does overlap with the Initiative vs. Guilt stage. So that might be the connection. Alternatively, the anal stage is about 18 months to 3 years, which is earlier. So Erikson's Initiative vs. Guilt is after the anal stage.

Looking at the options, option I is phallic stage. So that's probably the right answer. But wait, I also remember that Freud's theory is more about sexual drives, while Erikson's is about psychosocial development. So the phallic stage in Freud would relate to the Initiative vs. Guilt in Erikson because both are around the same age range and involve the development of the ego functions, like initiative and control.

Other options: F is ego stage, but I'm not sure if that's a stage in Freud's theory. G is latency period, which is after the phallic stage, so that's not it. H is conscious stage, which doesn't sound right. So I think the best answer is I: phallic stage.

The Initiative vs. Guilt stage in Erikson's theory corresponds to Freud's phallic stage, as both pertain to the same age range and involve the development of initiative and control.
