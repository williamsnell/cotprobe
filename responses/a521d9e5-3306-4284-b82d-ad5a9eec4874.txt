Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says: A charged cloud system produces an electric field near Earth's surface. There's a particle with a charge of -2.0 × 10^-9 C, and it's experiencing a downward electrostatic force of 3.0 × 10^-6 N. I need to find the magnitude of the electric field.

Hmm, I remember that electric fields relate to forces on charges. The formula that comes to mind is F = qE, where F is the force, q is the charge, and E is the electric field. Oh wait, but wait, the direction matters too because force and electric field are vectors. Since the question asks for the magnitude, I can probably ignore the direction part for now.

So, the formula rearranged to solve for E would be E = F / q. That makes sense because the electric field is the force per unit charge.

Let me plug in the numbers. The force F is 3.0 × 10^-6 N, and the charge q is -2.0 × 10^-9 C. Wait, but since I'm looking for the magnitude, I can take the absolute value of the charge. So the magnitude of q is 2.0 × 10^-9 C.

So E = (3.0 × 10^-6 N) / (2.0 × 10^-9 C). Let me calculate that.

First, the numerator is 3.0e-6 and the denominator is 2.0e-9. So when I divide them, the exponents: 10^-6 divided by 10^-9 is 10^3, which is 1000. Then 3 divided by 2 is 1.5, so 1.5 × 1000 = 1500. So 1500 N/C.

Wait, looking at the options, let me check. Option B is written as 1.5 × 10^3 N/C, which is 1500. Option D is 2.0e3, which is 2000. Hmm, but wait, did I do the calculation right?

Wait, wait, 3e-6 divided by 2e-9. Let me do it again. 3e-6 is 3 × 10^-6. 2e-9 is 2 × 10^-9.

So (3 × 10^-6) / (2 × 10^-9) = (3/2) × (10^-6 / 10^-9) )= 1.5 × 10^( -6 +9 )= 1.5 × 10^3, which is 1500 N/C. So that's option B.

Wait, but wait a second. The force is downward, and the charge is negative. So the direction of the electric field would be opposite to the force direction. But since the problem asks for the magnitude, the direction doesn't affect the calculation. So the magnitude is indeed 1500 N/C.

Looking at the options, option B is 1.5 × 10^3 N/C, which matches. So the answer should be B.
</think>

The magnitude of the electric field is calculated using the formula \( E = \frac{F}{q} \). Substituting \( F = 3.0 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{N} \) and \( q = 2.0 \times 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{C} \) (ignoring the negative sign for magnitude), we find \( E = \frac{3.0 \times 10^{-6}}{2.0 \times 10^{-9}} = 1500 \, \mathrm{N/C} \), which corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
