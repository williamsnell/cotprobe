Question:

Suppose that the public wishes to hold 15 percent of its total money balances as cash, the remainder in the form of bank deposits, and banks hold cash reserves equal to 12 per-cent of the deposits. What total amount of cash will be re-quired, for use both by the banks and the public, for a total money supply of $ 200 billion?

A: $ 100 billion
B: $ 50.4 billion
C: $ 170 billion
D: $ 60 billion

F: $ 24 billion
G: $ 42 billion
H: $ 75 billion
I: $ 20.4 billion
J: $ 36 billion

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question is about the total amount of cash required for both banks and the public when the total money supply is $200 billion. 

Alright, the public wants to hold 15% of their total money balances as cash, and the rest in bank deposits. So, if the total money supply is $200 billion, the public's cash holdings would be 15%, and the rest, which is 85%, would be in deposits. 

Wait, so first, let's compute how much cash the public wants. 15% of $200 billion is 0.15 * 200 = $30 billion. So public cash is $30 billion. That leaves $170 billion in deposits because 200 - 30 is 170.

But then, banks hold cash reserves equal to 12% of deposits. So the banks' cash reserves would be 12% of $170 billion. Let me calculate that: 0.12 * 170 = $20.4 billion. 

Wait, but the question is asking for the total amount of cash required for both banks and the public. So that would be the public's cash plus the banks' reserves. So $30 billion (public) + $20.4 billion (bank reserves) equals $50.4 billion. 

Looking at the options, option B is $50.4 billion. So that should be the correct answer.

The total money supply is $200 billion. The public holds 15% as cash: 0.15 * 200 = $30 billion. The remaining $170 billion is in deposits. Banks hold 12% of deposits as reserves: 0.12 * 170 = $20.4 billion. Adding both, the total cash required is $30 + $20.4 = $50.4 billion.

Answer: B
