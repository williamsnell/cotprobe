Question:

Why are the elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen (C, H, O, N) of immense importance in living matter ?

Options:

A: These elements make up the majority of non-living matter.
B: Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen are the four most abundant elements in living organisms, make up about 99 percent of the mass of most cells, and can readily form covalent bonds by electron pair sharing.
C: These elements are rare and precious.
D: They are noble gases that are crucial for maintaining the structure of proteins.
E: These elements are responsible for the magnetic properties of living organisms.
F: These elements are heavy metals that are essential for building DNA and RNA structures.
G: These elements cannot form covalent bonds.
H: Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are the only elements that organisms need for survival.
I: These elements are only important for their radioactive properties.
J: Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are the only elements that can form ionic bonds.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about why the elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are so important in living matter. I'm a bit rusty on my biology, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that these four elements are the main building blocks for organic compounds. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says these elements make up the majority of non-living matter. Wait, I think that's not right because the question is about living matter, so maybe A is talking about non-living, which is a distraction. Not sure though.

Option B states that they are the four most abundant in living organisms, make up about 99% of cell mass, and can form covalent bonds by sharing electrons. That sounds familiar. I remember that cells are mostly water (H2O), which accounts for a big part of the mass, and carbon is the backbone of all organic molecules. Covalent bonds are definitely a key part of how these elements form molecules like carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. So B seems plausible.

Option C says these elements are rare and precious. No, that's not right. Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are actually quite abundant in the universe and in living organisms. So C is incorrect.

Option D claims they're noble gases crucial for protein structure. Noble gases are like neon, argon, etc., and they're inert, not really reacting much. Proteins are made of amino acids, which involve C, H, O, N, so D doesn't fit. Plus, noble gases aren't part of proteins, so D is wrong.

Option E says they're responsible for magnetic properties. I don't think any of these elements are magnetic. Maybe iron is involved in magnetism, but it's not one of the four here. So E is incorrect.

Option F says they're heavy metals essential for DNA and RNA. Wait, heavy metals are things like lead or mercury, which aren't part of these elements. DNA and RNA do contain phosphorus, but that's a different element. So F is wrong.

Option G claims these elements can't form covalent bonds. That's the opposite of what I know. Carbon especially forms a lot of covalent bonds, which is why it's so versatile in forming organic molecules. So G is incorrect.

Option H states they're the only elements organisms need for survival. No, that's not true. There are other elements like phosphorus, sulfur, potassium, etc., which are also essential for various functions in organisms. So H is wrong.

Option I says these elements are important for their radioactive properties. None of C, H, O, or N are typically radioactive. While some isotopes might be, they aren't known for being radioactive in general. So I is incorrect.

Option J claims these are the only elements that can form ionic bonds. Ionic bonds involve the transfer of electrons, usually between a metal and a non-metal. Carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen are non-metals, and oxygen is also a non-metal. They usually form covalent bonds, especially carbon, which is tetravalent. So J is wrong.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be B because it accurately describes their abundance and the nature of their bonds, which are crucial for forming the complex molecules necessary for life.

The correct answer is B because it accurately explains that carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are the most abundant elements in living organisms, making up about 99% of the mass of most cells, and their ability to form covalent bonds through electron pair sharing is essential for constructing the organic molecules that sustain life.

Answer: B
