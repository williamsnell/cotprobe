Okay, so I've got this question about organizational behavior, specifically dealing with issues related to "sizing." The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, the question says there are two main issues associated with _____ sizing. The first blank is probably about the direction of the sizingâ€”whether it's downsizing or upsizing. I remember that downsizing refers to reducing the workforce, which is more common and often has more significant impacts on employees. So I'm leaning towards the first part being "Down."

Next, the second part says that one key issue is about employees' right to know if they're being made redundant. That sounds like it's related to information sharing or transparency within the company. So the second blank should be something like "involvement" or "autonomy." Wait, but the options have words like "involvement," "autonomy," "remuneration," etc. Let me think. The issue here is about whether employees have a right to know, which ties into their being informed, which relates to information policies. So maybe the second word is "involvement" because it's about employees being involved or informed about their status.

Then, the third part talks about a second issue, particularly the package employees receive when laid off. That's about severance pay or compensation. So the last two blanks should be related to that. The options include "Benefit," "Compensation," "Remuneration," and "Severance." "Severance" is a specific type of package given upon leaving, so that might fit.

Looking at the options, let's see which ones fit. The first part is likely "Down" as in downsizing. So options A, B, D, E, F, J are possible.

Option A: Down, Autonomy, Remuneration, Benefit. So the first issue is autonomy, which might relate to employees having the right to make decisions, but the question talks about the right to know, which is more about information, so maybe not autonomy.

Option B: Down, Involvement, Independence, Benefit. So the first issue is involvement, which fits because it's about employees being informed. The second issue is about independence, but the package is more about severance or compensation, so maybe not independence.

Option D: Down, Privacy, Autonomy, Benefit. Privacy doesn't seem to fit the first issue. The right to know is about information, not privacy.

Option E: Up, Involvement, Autonomy, Compensation. But the first part is "Up," which I think is less likely because the question seems to focus on redundancy, which is downsizing.

Option F: Down, Independence, Autonomy, Compensation. The first issue is independence, but again, the question is about the right to know, which is more about involvement.

Option J: Down, Involvement, Remuneration, Compensation. So the first issue is involvement, which fits. The second issue is remuneration, but the package is more about severance, which isn't listed in the options except perhaps as "compensation." Wait, remuneration refers to pay, but severance is a specific package. So maybe "compensation" fits better.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option J has "Remuneration" as the third word, which might not be the best fit. The question mentions the package received when laid off, which is typically a severance package, but "severance" isn't an option in J. Let me look at other options.

Option H: Up, Privacy, Remuneration, Severance. But the first part is "Up," which I think is incorrect.

Option G: Up, Involvement, Remuneration, Severance. Again, starting with "Up," which I don't think is right.

So back to Option J: Down, Involvement, Remuneration, Compensation. The first part is correct, involvement fits the first issue. The second issue is about the package, which is remuneration or compensation. But "remuneration" is more about regular pay, while "compensation" can include severance. Maybe "compensation" is a better fit for the package.

Wait, the options for the last part are either "Benefit," "Compensation," "Remuneration," or "Severance." The question says "package," which is typically a severance package. However, "Severance" isn't listed in all options. Let me check:

Looking at the options again:

Option J: ...Remuneration, Compensation. So the last part is "Compensation." That could work because it's a broader term that includes severance.

Alternatively, looking at Option E: Up, Involvement, Autonomy, Compensation. But the first part is "Up," which I think is wrong.

Wait, another angle: the two issues are about the right to know (involvement) and the package (severance). So looking for "Down" as the first word, and then the two issues.

Looking at the options again, Option J is Down, Involvement, Remuneration, Compensation. So the two issues are involvement and remuneration/compensation. But the second issue in the question is about the package, which is more specific than remuneration. Remuneration is about pay in general, while compensation can include severance.

Alternatively, in Option G: Up, Involvement, Remuneration, Severance. But again, the first part is "Up," which I think is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question says the second issue is particularly the package they receive when laid off. So the last blank should be something like "severance" or "compensation." Let's see which options have that.

Option G has "Severance" as the last word, but it's "Up," which I don't think is right.

Option H: Up, Privacy, Remuneration, Severance. Again, "Up" is first, so probably wrong.

Option J: Down, Involvement, Remuneration, Compensation. So the last part is "Compensation," which could include severance.

Alternatively, in the options, "Remuneration" is mentioned in some, but the package is more about severance. However, "Severance" isn't present in all options. So perhaps the correct option is J, where the issues are involvement and remuneration/compensation.

Wait, but the second issue is about the package, which is more about severance. So maybe the last word should be "Severance." But in the options, only G and H have "Severance." But G starts with "Up," which I think is wrong.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again.

The first part is "Downsizing," so options A, B, D, E, F, J.

The second part is about the right to know, which is involvement, so options B and J have "Involvement."

Option B: Down, Involvement, Independence, Benefit.

Option J: Down, Involvement, Remuneration, Compensation.

So the two issues are involvement and then the package. In option J, the third word is Remuneration, which refers to pay, but the package is more about severance. So maybe J isn't correct because it doesn't mention severance.

Wait, but the options don't have "Severance" in the third or fourth position except in G and H, which start with "Up." So perhaps the correct answer is J, even though it doesn't explicitly mention severance but uses "compensation," which is a broader term that includes severance.

Alternatively, maybe the second issue is about the package, so the third word is the type of package, like "Benefit" or "Compensation." So in option J, the third word is "Remuneration," which doesn't fit. So maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, maybe the second issue is about the package, so the third word is the type of package. So in the blanks, it's: [Down] sizing has two issues: [involvement] and [package type].

Looking at the options, Option J has: Down, Involvement, Remuneration, Compensation.

So the first issue is involvement, the second is remuneration and compensation? That doesn't make sense. The structure is two issues: first is [involvement], second is [package], particularly the [package] package.

So the structure is: two issues: [involvement] and [package type]. So the options should have four words: [Down], [involvement], [package], [package type].

Wait, the sentence is: "There are two main issues associated with _____ sizing. _______ is a key issue as due to the information policy of the corporation it can be argued that employees have a right to know if they are being made redundant. _______ is a second issue, particularly the ________ package that employees receive when laid off."

So the blanks are: [Down], [involvement], [package issue], [package type].

So looking for Down, involvement, something about the package, and the type.

So the third blank is about the second issue, which is about the package, so perhaps "remuneration" or "compensation." The last blank is the type, like "severance" or "compensation."

In Option J: Down, Involvement, Remuneration, Compensation. So third blank is "Remuneration," which is about pay, but the second issue is about the package, so maybe "compensation" is better.

Wait, but in the sentence structure, the third blank is the second issue, so the third word is the issue, and the fourth is the type of package.

Wait, the sentence is: "_______ is a second issue, particularly the ________ package that employees receive when laid off."

So the third blank is the issue (e.g., "package"), and the fourth is the type of package (e.g., "severance"). But the options don't have that structure. Looking at the options, each is four words, so the structure is:

[Down], [Issue1], [Issue2], [Type of package].

So for example, Option J: Down, Involvement, Remuneration, Compensation.

So Issue1 is "involvement," Issue2 is "remuneration," but that doesn't fit because Issue2 should be about the package.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me re-read the question.

"There are two main issues associated with _____ sizing. _______ is a key issue as due to the information policy of the corporation it can be argued that employees have a right to know if they are being made redundant. _______ is a second issue, particularly the ________ package that employees receive when laid off."

So the first blank is the type of sizing (Down). The second blank is the first issue (involvement). The third blank is the second issue (package), and the fourth is the type of package (severance or compensation).

Looking at the options, only Option J has "Involvement" as the second word. So the third word should be about the package issue, and the fourth word the type.

Option J: Down, Involvement, Remuneration, Compensation.

So the third word is "Remuneration," which is about pay, not the package. That doesn't fit. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, maybe the second issue is about the package, so the third word is "package" or "remuneration." But the options don't have "package" as a choice.

Alternatively, perhaps the third word is "remuneration" as in the package involves remuneration, but that's a bit unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the third word is "independence" or "autonomy," but that doesn't fit the package.

Wait, looking at Option F: Down, Independence, Autonomy, Compensation.

So the first issue is independence, which doesn't fit the right to know. So probably not.

Option B: Down, Involvement, Independence, Benefit.

Independence as the second issue doesn't fit the package.

Option A: Down, Autonomy, Remuneration, Benefit.

Autonomy as first issue, but the first issue is about information, so involvement is better.

So perhaps the correct answer is J, even though the third word doesn't perfectly fit. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: the two issues are:

1. Employees' right to know (involvement)

2. The package they receive (compensation or severance)

So the blanks should be: Down, Involvement, Package, Severance.

Looking at the options, the only one with "Involvement" as the second word is J and B.

Option J: Down, Involvement, Remuneration, Compensation.

So the third word is "Remuneration," which is about pay, not the package. So that might not be correct.

Option B: Down, Involvement, Independence, Benefit.

Independence as the second issue doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe I'm stuck. Let me try to eliminate options.

Option E: Up, Involvement, Autonomy, Compensation. First word is Up, which I think is wrong.

Option G: Up, Involvement, Remuneration, Severance. First word Up, wrong.

Option H: Up, Privacy, Remuneration, Severance. First word Up, wrong.

Option I: Up, Autonomy, Remuneration, Compensation. First word Up, wrong.

So only options A, B, D, F, J have Down as the first word.

Option A: Down, Autonomy, Remuneration, Benefit. So first issue is Autonomy, which doesn't fit the right to know.

Option B: Down, Involvement, Independence, Benefit. Second issue is Independence, which doesn't fit.

Option D: Down, Privacy, Autonomy, Benefit. First issue is Privacy, which isn't about the right to know.

Option F: Down, Independence, Autonomy, Compensation. First issue is Independence, which doesn't fit.

So the only option left with "Down" and "Involvement" is Option J: Down, Involvement, Remuneration, Compensation.

Even though "Remuneration" isn't exactly about the package, perhaps it's the closest fit. Alternatively, maybe "Compensation" is the package type, making the second issue about compensation. So the structure would be: Down sizing has two issues: involvement and remuneration/compensation.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the correct answer is J.
</think>

The question focuses on issues related to downsizing. The first issue is about employees' right to know if they are being made redundant, which aligns with "involvement." The second issue concerns the package employees receive when laid off, typically a severance package. Among the options, only Option J includes "Involvement" as the second word, making it the most fitting choice despite "Remuneration" not perfectly aligning with the package.

Answer: J
