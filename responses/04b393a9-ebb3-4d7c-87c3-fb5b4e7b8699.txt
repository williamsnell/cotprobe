Okay, so I have this question about the global literacy rate in 1950. I'm not exactly sure, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I know that literacy rates have been increasing over time, but I'm not sure how high or low they were in the mid-20th century. I remember that in the past, many people, especially in developing countries, couldn't read or write. So, the rate probably wasn't as high as it is now.

Let me think about historical data. I recall that in the 1900s, many countries were industrializing, and education systems were expanding, but it might have taken a while to reach a significant portion of the population. Also, after World War II, there were efforts to improve education globally, but maybe that started to take effect a bit later than 1950.

Looking at the options, I see choices ranging from 16% to 106%, but obviously, 106% can't be right because you can't have more than 100% literate people. So I can eliminate I right away.

Now, the other options: A is 66%, B is 96%, C is 56%, D is 16%, E is 86%, F is 26%, G is 76%, H is 46%, and J is 36%. 

I think that in 1950, the global literacy rate was probably around 50-60%. That seems reasonable because many countries were still developing their education systems. Let me break it down:

- Option D is 16%: That seems too low. I think even in 1950, some regions had higher rates. Maybe 16% is more like the pre-20th century rate.
- Option F is 26%: Still low, but possible for some areas, but globally, I think it's higher.
- Option H is 46%: Hmm, that's possible. Maybe that's the average?
- Option J is 36%: Also possible, but I'm leaning towards higher than that.
- Option C is 56%: That sounds plausible. I think I've heard that around mid-20th century, the global rate was around 50-60%.
- Option A is 66%: That's on the higher side. Maybe that's the rate after some significant progress.
- Option G is 76%: That seems a bit high for 1950. I think that's more like the late 20th century.
- Option E is 86%: Also very high, probably not accurate for 1950.
- Option B is 96%: That's almost universal, which is definitely not the case in 1950.

So, I'm thinking between C:56%, A:66%, and maybe H:46%. Wait, I should think about how literacy is defined. It's the ability to read and write, typically measured as the percentage of people over 15 who can do so. 

I remember a rough estimate that in 1950, the global literacy rate was around 56%. That would correspond to option C. I think that's the right answer because it's a commonly cited figure for that time period. Other sources I've seen suggest that by the mid-20th century, literacy was increasing but still below 60% globally.

The global literacy rate in 1950 was approximately 56%, making the correct answer C.
