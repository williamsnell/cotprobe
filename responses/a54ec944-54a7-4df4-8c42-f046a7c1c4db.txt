Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the vibrational energy levels of the HCl molecule. The question says the spacing between these levels is 0.36 eV, and I need to find the effective force constant in N/m. The options are given from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the energy levels of a diatomic molecule like HCl can be modeled using the quantum harmonic oscillator. The energy levels are quantized and equally spaced. The formula for the energy spacing between adjacent levels is given by ΔE = hν, where h is Planck's constant and ν is the frequency of vibration.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, the spacing between vibrational energy levels is related to the force constant and the reduced mass of the molecule. Oh right! The energy levels for a quantum harmonic oscillator are given by E_v = (v + 1/2) hν, where v is the vibrational quantum number. So the spacing between consecutive levels, ΔE, is just hν because the 1/2 hν term cancels out when subtracting adjacent levels.

So, ΔE = hν. But I also know that ν is related to the force constant (k) and the reduced mass (μ) of the molecule through the equation ν = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(k/μ). So combining these, ΔE = h*(1/(2π)) * sqrt(k/μ).

Wait, but maybe there's a more direct formula. Oh right, the energy spacing can also be expressed as ΔE = (1/2) * (k/μ) * (1/(2π))²), but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The energy levels are E_v = (v + 1/2) h ν, so the spacing is just h ν. And ν is given by ν = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(k/μ). So substituting that into ΔE gives ΔE = h * (1/(2π)) * sqrt(k/μ).

Alternatively, maybe I should use another approach. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is V = ½ k x², and the energy levels are quantized. The spacing between levels is ΔE = hν, and ν is sqrt(k/(2πμ)).

So, putting it all together: ΔE = (h/ (2π)) * sqrt(k/μ).

I think that's correct. So I can solve for k: k = (ΔE * 2π / h)² * μ.

Wait, let me write that again. Rearranging the equation:

ΔE = (h/(2π)) * sqrt(k/μ)

Squaring both sides:

(ΔE)^2 = (h²/(4π²)) * (k/μ)

Multiply both sides by μ:

(ΔE)^2 * μ = (h²/(4π²)) * k

Then, solve for k:

k = (4π² * (ΔE)^2 * μ) / h²

So, k = (4π² * ΔE² * μ) / h².

Now, I need to find μ, the reduced mass of HCl. HCl consists of hydrogen and chlorine. The atomic mass of hydrogen is approximately 1.00784 u, and chlorine is about 34.96885 u. So the reduced mass μ is calculated as (m_H * m_Cl) / (m_H + m_Cl).

Wait, but I think I should convert these masses into kilograms because the units need to be consistent. Let's see, 1 u is approximately 1.66053906660×10^-27 kg.

So m_H = 1.00784 u * 1.6605e-27 kg/u ≈ 1.6735e-27 kg.

m_Cl = 34.96885 u * 1.6605e-27 kg/u ≈ 5.8014e-26 kg.

So μ = (1.6735e-27 kg * 5.8014e-26 kg) / (1.6735e-27 + 5.8014e-26) kg.

Let me compute the denominator first: 1.6735e-27 +5.8014e-26 = 1.6735e-27 +58.014e-27 = (1.6735 +58.014) * 1e-27 = 59.6875e-27 kg.

Now the numerator: 1.6735e-27 *5.8014e-26 = 1.6735 *5.8014e-53 ≈ 9.708e-53 kg².

So μ = 9.708e-53 /59.6875e-27 = (9.708 /59.6875) * 1e-26 ≈ 0.1627 *1e-26 = 1.627e-27 kg.

Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 1.6735e-27 kg *5.8014e-26 kg = (1.6735 *5.8014) * 1e-27 *1e-26 = 9.708 *1e-53 kg².

The denominator is 5.8014e-26 +1.6735e-27 = 5.8014e-26 +0.16735e-25 = 5.8014e-26 +0.16735e-25 = 5.8014e-26 +1.6735e-26 * 0.1? Wait, perhaps I should convert both to the same exponent.

Wait, 1.6735e-27 is 0.16735e-26.

So 5.8014e-26 + 0.16735e-26 = (5.8014 +0.16735) e-26 = 5.96875e-26 kg.

So μ = (9.708e-53) / (5.96875e-26) = (9.708 /5.96875) *1e-27 ≈ 1.627 *1e-27 kg.

Wait, 9.708 divided by 5.96875 is approximately 1.627.

So μ ≈ 1.627e-27 kg.

Now, I have ΔE = 0.36 eV. I need to convert this into joules because the other constants are in SI units.

1 eV = 1.60218e-19 joules, so ΔE = 0.36 *1.60218e-19 J ≈ 5.7678e-20 J.

Now, let's plug everything into the formula for k:

k = (4π² * (ΔE)^2 * μ) / h².

Planck's constant h is approximately 6.62607015e-34 J·s.

So let's compute each part step by step.

First, compute (ΔE)^2: (5.7678e-20 J)^2 ≈ 3.325e-40 J².

Then multiply by μ: 3.325e-40 J² * 1.627e-27 kg ≈ 5.414e-67 J²·kg.

Next, multiply by 4π²: 4 * (π)^2 ≈ 39.4784. So 39.4784 *5.414e-67 ≈ 213.0e-67 → 2.13e-65 J²·kg.

Now, h² is (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 J²·s².

So, k = (2.13e-65 J²·kg) / (4.39e-67 J²·s²) ) = (2.13e-65 /4.39e-67) * (J²·kg)/(J²·s²) ) → kg/s², which is N/m.

Calculating the coefficient: 2.13e-65 /4.39e-67 = (2.13 /4.39) * 1e2 ≈ 0.485 *100 = 48.5.

So, k ≈ 48.5 N/m? Wait, but that seems low. Let me check my calculations again because the options are in the hundreds.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents somewhere. Let me go through the calculations again.

Wait, let me recompute each step carefully.

1. μ calculation:

m_H = 1.00784 u → 1.00784 *1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 1.6735e-27 kg.

m_Cl =34.96885 u → 34.96885 *1.6605e-27 ≈5.8014e-26 kg.

μ = (m_H * m_Cl)/(m_H + m_Cl) = (1.6735e-27 *5.8014e-26) / (1.6735e-27 +5.8014e-26).

Compute denominator: 1.6735e-27 +5.8014e-26 = 1.6735e-27 +58.014e-27 = 59.6875e-27 kg.

Numerator: 1.6735e-27 *5.8014e-26 = (1.6735 *5.8014) *1e-53 = 9.708 *1e-53 kg².

So μ = 9.708e-53 /59.6875e-27 = (9.708 /59.6875) *1e-26 ≈ 0.1627 *1e-26 =1.627e-27 kg.

That seems correct.

2. ΔE = 0.36 eV → 0.36 *1.602e-19 J =5.767e-20 J.

3. Now, compute (ΔE)^2 = (5.767e-20)^2 = 3.325e-40 J².

4. Multiply by μ: 3.325e-40 J² *1.627e-27 kg = 5.414e-67 J²·kg.

5. Multiply by 4π²: 4*(π^2)=39.478, so 39.478 *5.414e-67 ≈ 213.0e-67 →2.13e-65 J²·kg.

6. h =6.626e-34 J·s. h² = (6.626e-34)^2 = (6.626)^2 *1e-68 ≈43.9 *1e-68=4.39e-67 J²·s².

7. So k = (2.13e-65 J²·kg) / (4.39e-67 J²·s²) ) = (2.13e-65 /4.39e-67) * kg/s².

2.13e-65 /4.39e-67 = (2.13/4.39) *1e2 ≈ 0.485 *100=48.5.

So k≈48.5 N/m. But looking at the options, the closest is J: 420, H:490, etc. Wait, 48.5 isn't even an option. The options are all in the hundreds. Did I make a mistake in the exponents?

Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me double-check the formula for k.

Earlier, I wrote:

k = (4π² * (ΔE)^2 * μ) / h².

But wait, the correct formula should be:

ΔE = (h/(2π)) * sqrt(k/μ).

So rearranged, sqrt(k/μ) = (2π ΔE)/h.

Squaring both sides: k/μ = (4π² ΔE²)/h².

Then, k = μ * (4π² ΔE²) / h².

Which is the same as before. So that part seems correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversions. Let me check the eV to joules again.

1 eV = 1.60218e-19 J. So 0.36 eV = 0.36 *1.60218e-19 = 5.7678e-20 J. That seems correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating μ. Let me re-calculate μ.

m_H =1.00784 u =1.00784 *1.66053906660e-27 kg ≈ 1.6735e-27 kg.

m_Cl=34.96885 u =34.96885 *1.6605e-27 ≈ 5.8014e-26 kg.

μ = (1.6735e-27 *5.8014e-26) / (1.6735e-27 +5.8014e-26) = (9.708e-53) / (5.96875e-26) ≈1.627e-27 kg.

Wait, 5.96875e-26 kg is the denominator. 9.708e-53 /5.96875e-26 = (9.708 /5.96875) *1e-27 ≈1.627e-27 kg.

That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of k. Let me recompute each step with exact numbers.

Compute numerator: 4π² * (ΔE)^2 * μ.

ΔE =5.767e-20 J.

(ΔE)^2 = (5.767e-20)^2 =3.325e-40 J².

Multiply by μ:3.325e-40 *1.627e-27 =5.414e-67 J²·kg.

Multiply by 4π²:39.478 *5.414e-67 = 213.0e-67 →2.13e-65 J²·kg.

Denominator: h² = (6.626e-34)^2 =4.39e-67 J²·s².

So k =2.13e-65 /4.39e-67 = (2.13e-65)/(4.39e-67) )= (2.13/4.39) *1e2 → approx 0.485 *100=48.5 N/m.

Hmm, but none of the options are near 48.5. The closest option is J:420, which is much higher. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I forgot a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me think again about the formula.

Wait, the energy spacing in a harmonic oscillator is ΔE = hν = (h/(2π)) * sqrt(k/μ).

Yes, that's correct. So perhaps I should check that again.

Alternatively, maybe I confused frequency ν with angular frequency ω. Because ω = 2πν, and in the harmonic oscillator, the energy is E = (n + ½) ħω, where ħ = h/(2π). So ΔE = ħω = hν.

Wait, so another approach: the energy spacing is ΔE = ħ * ω, where ω is the angular frequency, and ω = sqrt(k/μ).

So, ΔE = ħ * sqrt(k/μ).

Solving for k: k = (ΔE / ħ)^2 * μ.

Ah, perhaps this is a simpler way.

So, let's compute this.

ΔE =5.767e-20 J.

ħ = h/(2π) ≈6.626e-34 /6.2832 ≈1.054e-34 J·s.

So, ΔE / ħ =5.767e-20 /1.054e-34 ≈5.47e14 s^-1.

Then, square it: (5.47e14)^2 ≈3.0e29 s^-2.

Multiply by μ:3.0e29 *1.627e-27 kg =3.0 *1.627 *1e2 →4.881e2 N/m → approximately 488 N/m.

Wait, that's about 488 N/m. Looking at the options, the closest is H:490.0.

Wait, but earlier calculation gave 48.5, and now 488. Hmm, which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents when using the alternative formula. Let me compute it again.

k = (ΔE / ħ)^2 * μ.

Compute ΔE / ħ: 5.767e-20 J /1.054e-34 J·s =5.47e14 1/s.

Square that: (5.47e14)^2 = (5.47)^2 *1e28 ≈30 *1e28=3e29 s^-2.

Multiply by μ=1.627e-27 kg: 3e29 *1.627e-27 =3 *1.627 *1e2 →4.881 *100=488.1 N/m.

So about 488 N/m. That's close to option H:490.0.

Wait, earlier when I did it the first way, I got 48.5 N/m, but that's because I think I messed up the exponents somewhere. So using this second method, I get around 488 N/m, which is option H:490.0.

So the correct answer should be H:490.0.
</think>

To calculate the effective force constant \( k \) for the HCl molecule, we use the relationship between the vibrational energy spacing and the harmonic oscillator model. The energy spacing between vibrational levels is given by:

\[
\Delta E = \hbar \omega = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{\mu}}
\]

Rearranging for \( k \):

\[
k = \mu \left(\frac{\Delta E}{\hbar}\right)^2
\]

### Step 1: Reduced Mass (\( \mu \))
The reduced mass of HCl is calculated using the atomic masses of hydrogen (\( m_H \)) and chlorine (\( m_{Cl} \)):

\[
\mu = \frac{m_H \cdot m_{Cl}}{m_H + m_{Cl}}
\]

Converting atomic masses to kilograms (\( 1 \, \text{u} = 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \)):

\[
m_H = 1.00784 \, \text{u} \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg/u} \approx 1.6735 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
\]
\[
m_{Cl} = 34.96885 \, \text{u} \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg/u} \approx 5.8014 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{kg}
\]

\[
\mu = \frac{(1.6735 \times 10^{-27})(5.8014 \times 10^{-26})}{1.6735 \times 10^{-27} + 5.8014 \times 10^{-26}}
\]

\[
\mu \approx 1.627 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
\]

### Step 2: Energy Spacing (\( \Delta E \))
The energy spacing is given as \( 0.36 \, \text{eV} \). Converting to joules:

\[
1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}, \quad \Delta E = 0.36 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \approx 5.767 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 3: Planck's Constant (\( \hbar \))
\[
\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{2\pi} \approx 1.054 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}
\]

### Step 4: Force Constant (\( k \))
Substituting into the formula for \( k \):

\[
k = \mu \left(\frac{\Delta E}{\hbar}\right)^2
\]

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{\hbar} = \frac{5.767 \times 10^{-20}}{1.054 \times 10^{-34}} \approx 5.47 \times 10^{14} \, \text{s}^{-1}
\]

\[
\left(\frac{\Delta E}{\hbar}\right)^2 = (5.47 \times 10^{14})^2 \approx 3.0 \times 10^{29} \, \text{s}^{-2}
\]

\[
k = (1.627 \times 10^{-27}) \times (3.0 \times 10^{29}) \approx 488 \, \text{N/m}
\]

### Final Answer:
The calculated force constant is approximately \( 488 \, \text{N/m} \), which corresponds to option **H: 490.0**.

H: 490.0
