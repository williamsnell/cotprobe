Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about what Nathanson argues we can send by abolishing the death penalty. The options are A through J. I'm not entirely sure who Nathanson is, but I think he's a philosopher who has written about the death penalty. Let me try to break this down.

The question is about the message Nathanson believes we send by getting rid of the death penalty. I remember that abolitionists often argue against the death penalty on moral grounds. So, the message is likely about a moral stance.

Looking at the options:

A: We believe in the possibility of redemption and change. So, this is saying that by abolishing the death penalty, we're showing that we think people can change. That makes sense because if you don't execute someone, you might be giving them a chance to redeem themselves or change their ways.

B: There are some penalties worse than death. Hmm, I'm not sure. I think this is more about saying that some punishments are more severe, but I don't remember Nathanson focusing on that. Maybe this is more about deterrence, but I'm not certain.

C: We are unable to administer justice effectively. This could be about the system's flaws, but I think this is more about the system being error-prone or ineffective, which is another angle.

D: There is no punishment proportional to murder. That's an interesting one. It's about retributive justice, perhaps arguing that no punishment is as bad as murder, so the death penalty isn't justified. But I'm not sure if that's the main message Nathanson is sending.

E: There is always a possibility of judicial errors. This relates to the risk of executing innocent people, which is a common argument against the death penalty. But is this the message Nathanson is focusing on?

F: We are lenient towards heinous crimes. Wait, if we abolish the death penalty, does that mean we're being lenient? Or does it mean we're taking a more rehabilitative approach? I think F is more about being too lenient, which doesn't quite fit with the idea of abolition as a moral stance.

G: We should prioritize rehabilitation over punishment. This aligns with a more rehabilitative approach rather than punitive. Some abolitionists do argue for this, focusing on helping the person rather than just punishment.

H: None of the above. If none of the other options fit, this would be the choice. But I think one of them does.

I: We respect the dignity of human life. This seems very much in line with a lot of abolitionist arguments. The death penalty devalues life, so abolishing it shows respect for human dignity.

J: We have a flawed criminal justice system. This is more about systemic issues, which is a valid point, but I'm not sure if it's the primary message Nathanson is sending.

Now, trying to recall what Nathanson's arguments are. I think he's discussed the idea that the death penalty is a failure of justice because it's irreversible and that it's morally wrong to take a life. He might also argue that it doesn't deter crime and that it's applied inconsistently.

Wait, another angle: some argue that the death penalty is a form of retribution, and that it's not just. So, by abolishing it, we might be saying that we don't believe in retributive justice, or perhaps that we believe in the possibility of redemption.

Option A says we believe in the possibility of redemption and change. That sounds like it's about giving people a chance to change, which is a common theme in abolitionist arguments. Similarly, option I is about respecting human dignity, which is also a strong argument.

I think Nathanson might focus on the idea that the death penalty is a failure of justice because it's irreversible and that it's morally wrong. But I'm trying to see which option aligns with that.

Alternatively, the message could be that we respect human dignity, which is option I. That seems very plausible because many argue that the death penalty degrades the value of life.

Wait, but the question is about the message Nathanson argues we can send by abolishing the death penalty. So, the message is about what society is conveying by making that choice.

If we choose to abolish the death penalty, what are we signaling? We might be signaling that we don't believe in the deterrent effect, that we're against retribution, that we believe in rehabilitation, or that we respect human life.

Option I is about respect for human dignity, which is a strong statement. Option A is about believing in redemption and change, which is also a significant message.

I'm a bit torn between A and I. Let me think again. Nathanson's arguments might include the idea that the death penalty is a moral failure because it's irreversible and that it's not just. He might also argue that it doesn't make society safer, so by abolishing it, we're prioritizing life over punishment.

But the question is about the message we send. So, if we abolish it, we might be sending a message that we value life and dignity over retribution. So, option I seems to fit that.

Alternatively, if the message is about giving people a chance to change, then option A is the choice. I think both A and I are strong options, but I need to decide which one Nathanson emphasizes.

I think I'll go with A because it's about the possibility of redemption and change, which is a key message in abolitionist thought, emphasizing that people can change and that punishment shouldn't be final.

The correct answer is **A: we believe in the possibility of redemption and change**. Nathanson's argument likely emphasizes that abolishing the death penalty signals a belief in the potential for individuals to change and redeem themselves, aligning with the idea of rehabilitation over punishment.

**Answer: A**
