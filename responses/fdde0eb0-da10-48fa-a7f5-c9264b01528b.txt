Okay, so I've got this differential equation problem to solve. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem is an initial value problem (IVP) given by:
$$
y'' + 5y' + 6y = 0, \quad y(0) = 2, \quad y'(0) = \beta
$$
where β is greater than 0. I need to determine the smallest value of β such that the minimum value of y, denoted y_m, is at least 4. The options given are A through J, each with specific numerical values.

Alright, first, I remember that this is a linear homogeneous second-order differential equation with constant coefficients. The standard approach is to find the characteristic equation and solve for its roots. Let me jot that down.

The characteristic equation for the differential equation ay'' + by' + cy = 0 is:
$$
r^2 + 5r + 6 = 0
$$
Let me solve for r.
Using the quadratic formula, r = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a). Here, a=1, b=5, c=6.

So, discriminant D = 5² - 4*1*6 = 25 - 24 = 1. Since D is positive, we'll have two distinct real roots.

Calculating the roots:
r = [-5 + sqrt(1)] / 2 = (-5 +1)/2 = (-4)/2 = -2
r = [-5 - sqrt(1)] / 2 = (-5 -1)/2 = (-6)/2 = -3

So, the roots are r = -2 and r = -3. Therefore, the general solution to the differential equation is:
$$
y(t) = C_1 e^{-2t} + C_2 e^{-3t}
$$
Where C1 and C2 are constants determined by the initial conditions.

Now, applying the initial conditions to find C1 and C2. The initial conditions are y(0)=2 and y'(0)=β.

First, let me find y(0):
y(0) = C1 e^{0} + C2 e^{0} = C1 + C2 = 2. So equation (1): C1 + C2 = 2.

Next, find y'(t) to apply the second initial condition. Let's compute y'(t):
y'(t) = -2 C1 e^{-2t} - 3 C2 e^{-3t}
So, at t=0:
y'(0) = -2 C1 -3 C2 = β. Equation (2): -2 C1 -3 C2 = β.

Now, I have a system of two equations:
1. C1 + C2 = 2
2. -2 C1 -3 C2 = β

I need to solve this system for C1 and C2 in terms of β, or perhaps express everything in terms of β.

Let me solve equation (1) for C1:
C1 = 2 - C2

Substitute this into equation (2):
-2(2 - C2) -3 C2 = β
Expanding this:
-4 + 2 C2 -3 C2 = β
Simplify:
-4 - C2 = β
So, rearranged:
C2 = -β -4

Wait, that seems a bit odd. Let me double-check my algebra.

Wait, equation (2) substitution:
-2*(2 - C2) -3 C2
= (-4 + 2 C2) -3 C2
= -4 + 2 C2 -3 C2
= -4 - C2
So, equation (2) becomes:
-4 - C2 = β
Which gives C2 = -4 - β.

Then, from equation (1), C1 = 2 - C2 = 2 - (-4 - β) = 2 +4 + β = 6 + β.

So, C1 = 6 + β and C2 = -4 - β.

Wait, but C2 has a negative value since β is positive. Hmm. Let me check if this makes sense. Since the exponential terms e^{-2t} and e^{-3t} are always positive, the coefficients could be positive or negative depending on the solution.

So, the general solution with these constants is:
y(t) = (6 + β) e^{-2t} + (-4 - β) e^{-3t}

Simplify:
y(t) = (6 + β) e^{-2t} - (4 + β) e^{-3t}

Now, I need to find the minimum value of y(t), y_m, and ensure that y_m >= 4. So, I need to find the time t where y(t) reaches its minimum and then set that equal to 4, then solve for β.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the function y(t) and find its critical points by taking its derivative and setting it to zero. The critical points will give the minima and maxima.

Wait, but since the problem is about the minimum, perhaps I can compute the derivative, find where it's zero, then evaluate y at that point and set it equal to 4.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to analyze the solution as a combination of exponentials and find its minimum.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write y(t) in terms of e^{-2t} and e^{-3t}, and then find its minimum by taking the derivative and setting it to zero.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, let's compute y'(t):

y(t) = (6 + β) e^{-2t} - (4 + β) e^{-3t}

So,
y'(t) = (6 + β)(-2) e^{-2t} - (4 + β)(-3) e^{-3t}
Simplify:
y'(t) = -2(6 + β) e^{-2t} + 3(4 + β) e^{-3t}

We need to find the critical points where y'(t) = 0.

So, set y'(t) = 0:
-2(6 + β) e^{-2t} + 3(4 + β) e^{-3t} = 0

Let me factor out e^{-3t} to simplify:
e^{-3t} [ -2(6 + β) e^{t} + 3(4 + β) ] = 0

Since e^{-3t} is never zero, the equation reduces to:
-2(6 + β) e^{t} + 3(4 + β) = 0

Let me solve for e^{t}:

-2(6 + β) e^{t} + 3(4 + β) = 0
=> 2(6 + β) e^{t} = 3(4 + β)
=> e^{t} = [3(4 + β)] / [2(6 + β)]

Take natural logarithm on both sides:
t = ln [ (3(4 + β)) / (2(6 + β)) ) ]

That's the time where the function y(t) has a critical point. Now, I need to check whether this critical point is a minimum or maximum. Since the exponential functions are decaying, the function y(t) will approach zero as t approaches infinity, and since the coefficients might be positive or negative, the critical point could be a maximum or a minimum. Let me check the second derivative or analyze the behavior around that point.

But perhaps a simpler approach is to compute y(t) at this critical point and set it equal to 4, then solve for β.

So, let me denote t0 as the time where the critical point occurs:
t0 = ln [ (3(4 + β)) / (2(6 + β)) ) ]

Now, compute y(t0):

y(t0) = (6 + β) e^{-2 t0} - (4 + β) e^{-3 t0}

Let me express this in terms of e^{t0} which is [3(4 + β)]/[2(6 + β)].

Let me compute e^{-2 t0} and e^{-3 t0}:

e^{-2 t0} = [2(6 + β)/(3(4 + β))]^2
e^{-3 t0} = [2(6 + β)/(3(4 + β))]^3

So, substituting back into y(t0):

y(t0) = (6 + β) [2(6 + β)/(3(4 + β))]^2 - (4 + β) [2(6 + β)/(3(4 + β))]^3

Let me factor out [2(6 + β)/(3(4 + β))]^2:

y(t0) = [2(6 + β)/(3(4 + β))]^2 [ (6 + β) - (4 + β) * [2(6 + β)/(3(4 + β))] ]

Simplify the term inside the brackets:

= [ (6 + β) - (4 + β) * (2(6 + β)/(3(4 + β))) ]

Let me compute the second term inside:

(4 + β) * [2(6 + β)/(3(4 + β))] = 2(6 + β)/3

So, the expression becomes:

(6 + β) - [2(6 + β)/3] = (6 + β)(1 - 2/3) = (6 + β)(1/3) = (6 + β)/3

So, putting it all together:

y(t0) = [2(6 + β)/(3(4 + β))]^2 * (6 + β)/3

Simplify this:

= [ (2(6 + β))^2 ] / [ (3(4 + β))^2 ] * (6 + β)/3

= [4(6 + β)^2] / [9(4 + β)^2] * (6 + β)/3

Multiply the terms:

= [4(6 + β)^2 * (6 + β)] / [9(4 + β)^2 * 3]
= [4(6 + β)^3] / [27(4 + β)^2]

So, y(t0) = [4(6 + β)^3] / [27(4 + β)^2]

We are given that y_m >=4, so:

[4(6 + β)^3] / [27(4 + β)^2] >=4

Let me write this inequality:

4(6 + β)^3 / [27(4 + β)^2] >=4

Divide both sides by 4:

(6 + β)^3 / [27(4 + β)^2] >=1

Multiply both sides by 27(4 + β)^2 (which is positive, so inequality remains same):

(6 + β)^3 >=27(4 + β)^2

Let me write this as:

(6 + β)^3 -27(4 + β)^2 >=0

Let me factor this expression or perhaps make a substitution to simplify.

Let me set u = β + something, but perhaps expand both sides.

Alternatively, let me compute (6 + β)^3 and 27(4 + β)^2.

Compute (6 + β)^3:
= β^3 + 3*6*β^2 + 3*6^2*β +6^3
= β^3 + 18 β^2 + 108 β + 216

Compute 27(4 + β)^2:
= 27*(β^2 +8β +16)
=27β^2 +216β +432

So, the inequality becomes:

β^3 +18β^2 +108β +216 >=27β^2 +216β +432

Bring all terms to the left:

β^3 +18β^2 +108β +216 -27β^2 -216β -432 >=0

Simplify:

β^3 + (18β^2 -27β^2) + (108β -216β) + (216 -432) >=0

= β^3 -9β^2 -108β -216 >=0

So, the inequality is:

β^3 -9β^2 -108β -216 >=0

We can factor this cubic equation. Let me try to find rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible roots are factors of 216 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±3, etc.

Let me test β=12:

12^3 -9*(12)^2 -108*12 -216 = 1728 - 1296 -1296 -216

= 1728 - (1296 +1296 +216) = 1728 - 2808 = -1080 <0

Not zero. Next, try β=18:

18^3=5832; 9β^2=9*324=2916; 108β=1944; 216.

So, 5832 -2916 -1944 -216 = 5832 - (2916+1944+216) = 5832 - 5076=756>0.

So, at β=18, the expression is positive. Let me check β=12: negative. So, somewhere between 12 and 18, the expression crosses zero.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the cubic.

Let me write the cubic as:

β^3 -9β^2 -108β -216

I can try to factor by grouping.

Group terms as (β^3 -9β^2) + (-108β -216)

Factor β^2 from first group: β^2(β -9) -108(β +2)

Hmm, not obvious. Alternatively, perhaps factor out a common term.

Wait, maybe try synthetic division with β= -3.

Let me plug β=-3:

(-3)^3 -9*(-3)^2 -108*(-3) -216 = -27 -81 +324 -216 = (-27-81)+(324-216) = (-108) +108 =0

So, β= -3 is a root. Therefore, (β +3) is a factor.

Now, perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor it out.

Dividing β^3 -9β^2 -108β -216 by (β +3):

Using synthetic division:

-3 | 1   -9    -108    -216
          -3     36      216
      1   -12     -72      0

So, the cubic factors as (β +3)(β^2 -12β -72).

Now, set the cubic >=0:

(β +3)(β^2 -12β -72) >=0

Factor the quadratic: β^2 -12β -72.

Compute discriminant D=144 + 288=432. sqrt(432)=sqrt(16*27)=4*sqrt(27)=4*3*sqrt(3)=12√3≈20.7846

So, roots of the quadratic are [12 ± 12√3]/2 =6 ±6√3.

Since 6√3≈10.3923, the roots are approximately 6 +10.3923≈16.3923 and 6 -10.3923≈-4.3923.

So, the quadratic factors as (β - (6 +6√3))(β - (6 -6√3)).

But since we're looking for real roots, the cubic factors are (β +3)(β - (6 +6√3))(β - (6 -6√3)).

Now, considering β>0 as given in the problem, we can ignore the negative root β=-3 and the other negative root at approximately -4.3923.

So, the roots relevant are at β=6 -6√3≈-4.3923 (ignore) and β=6 +6√3≈16.3923.

Now, we can analyze the sign of the cubic in the intervals determined by the roots.

The roots are at β=-3, β≈16.3923, and β≈-4.3923.

But since β>0, we only consider β>0.

In the interval β>16.3923, let's test β=18, as before, the cubic is positive.

Between 0 and 16.3923, let's pick β=12, which gave a negative value.

So, the inequality (β +3)(β^2 -12β -72) >=0 holds when β >=16.3923.

Therefore, the smallest β satisfying the inequality is β=16.3923, which is option B.

Wait, but let me make sure. Because y(t0) is the minimum value. So, we set y(t0) >=4, which led us to β >=16.3923. So, the smallest β is 16.3923, which is option B.
</think>

To solve the IVP, we first find the general solution by solving the characteristic equation, yielding roots -2 and -3. The solution is \( y(t) = C_1 e^{-2t} + C_2 e^{-3t} \). Applying initial conditions, we determine \( C_1 = 6 + \beta \) and \( C_2 = -4 - \beta \). To find the minimum value \( y_m \), we find the critical point by setting \( y'(t) = 0 \), leading to \( t_0 = \ln\left(\frac{3(4 + \beta)}{2(6 + \beta)}\right) \). Substituting \( t_0 \) into \( y(t) \) gives \( y(t_0) = \frac{4(6 + \beta)^3}{27(4 + \beta)^2} \). Setting \( y(t_0) \geq 4 \) and solving the inequality leads to \( \beta \geq 16.3923 \), the smallest value being option B.

Answer: B
