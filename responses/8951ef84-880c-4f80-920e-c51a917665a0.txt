Okay, so I've got this problem here about a constant-volume perfect gas thermometer. Hmm, I remember from my classes that this is a type of thermometer where the volume is kept constant, so the pressure of the gas changes with temperature. The ideal gas law must be involved here because it's a perfect gas.

The question says that at the triple point of water, which is 273.16 K, the pressure is 6.69 kPa. And they want to know what pressure corresponds to 100.00°C. Wait, wait, 100°C is the boiling point of water, but I think the triple point is a bit different, but maybe that's just extra info.

So, since it's a constant volume situation, the pressure is directly proportional to the absolute temperature. That makes sense because PV = nRT, and if V and n are constant, then P is proportional to T.

Let me write that down: P1 / T1 = P2 / T2. Right, so P1 is 6.69 kPa, and T1 is 273.16 K. The target temperature T2 is 100.00°C, which I need to convert to Kelvin. Oh yeah, adding 273.15, so 100 + 273.15 is 373.15 K.

So plugging into the equation: 6.69 / 273.16 = P2 / 373.15. Now I need to solve for P2.

Let me compute that. So P2 = (6.69 * 373.15) / 273.16.

Hmm, let's compute the numerator first. 6.69 multiplied by 373.15. I'll approximate that. 6 * 373 is about 2238, and 0.69 * 373 is approximately 257. So total around 2238 + 257 = 2495. Then divide by 273.16.

Wait, 2495 divided by 273.16. Let me see, 273 times 9 is about 2457 (since 273 *9=2457), so 2495 is a bit more than that. So 9.1 times 273 is about 2496.3. Oh, wait, that's close to 2495. So P2 is approximately 9.1 kPa. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option I is 9.14 kPa, and option D is 8.00. Wait, but I think I might have miscalculated because maybe I should do it more accurately.

Let me compute 6.69 * 373.15. Let's break it down:

373.15 * 6 = 2238.9
373.15 * 0.69 = let's calculate that. 373.15 * 0.6 = 223.89, and 373.15 *0.09=33.5835. So adding those gives 223.89 +33.5835=257.4735.

Adding to 2238.9: 2238.9 +257.4735=2496.3735.

Now divide by 273.16. So 2496.3735 / 273.16.

Hmm, 273.16 *9 = 2458.44. Subtracting that from 2496.3735 gives 2496.3735-2458.44=37.9335.

Now, 37.9335 /273.16 ≈ 0.1389.

So total P2≈9.1389 kPa, which is approximately 9.14 kPa. So that's option I.

Wait, but let me cross-check my calculations because sometimes these can be tricky. Alternatively, maybe I can use a calculator approach.

Alternatively, compute the ratio T2/T1 first. T2 is 373.15 K, T1 is 273.16 K.

So 373.15 / 273.16 ≈ let's see, 273.16 *1.366 ≈ 373.15 because 0.366 *273 is about 99.8, adding to 273 gives 372.8, which is close to 373.15. So the ratio is approximately 1.366.

Then, P2 = 6.69 * 1.366 ≈ let's compute that. 6 *1.366=8.196, 0.69*1.366≈0.94554. So adding gives 8.196+0.94554≈9.1415 kPa, which is about 9.14 kPa. So that's option I.

The pressure at 100.00°C is calculated using the constant-volume gas law, resulting in approximately 9.14 kPa.

The answer is I.
