Okay, so I've got this question about electromagnetic wave penetration depths, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by recalling what I know about this topic.

The question says the wave is traveling in the x-direction, and the amplitude is given by E_y = E_0 e^(-x/δ). I remember that in wave attenuation, the amplitude decreases exponentially with distance x. The term δ here is probably the skin depth, which tells us how far the wave penetrates into a material before its amplitude drops significantly.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, δ is the skin depth. The skin depth formula I remember is δ = 1/√(με), but that's more about the material's properties. But in the given equation, the amplitude is E0 multiplied by e^(-x/δ), so δ is like the exponential decay factor.

So, the depth of penetration usually refers to the distance where the amplitude drops to a certain percentage of its initial value. For example, the 10% depth is the x where E_y is 10% of E0, and similarly for 60%.

So, let's think about the formula. The amplitude is E_y = E_0 e^(-x/δ). To find the depth where the amplitude is a certain percentage, say P%, we set up the equation:

E_y = (P/100) * E0 = E0 e^(-x/δ)

Divide both sides by E0:

P/100 = e^(-x/δ)

Take natural logarithm on both sides:

ln(P/100) = -x/δ

Multiply both sides by -1:

x = -δ ln(P/100)

Alternatively, that's the same as x = δ ln(100/P)

Because ln(1/P) = -ln(P), so flipping it.

So for 10% depth:

x_10 = δ ln(100/10) = δ ln(10)

And for 60% depth:

x_60 = δ ln(100/60) = δ ln(5/3) ≈ δ * 0.5108

Wait, wait. Let me compute those values accurately.

ln(10) is approximately 2.3026, so x_10 is about 2.3026 δ, which is roughly 2.3 δ. 

For 60%, P=60, so 100/60 = 5/3 ≈ 1.6667. ln(5/3) is approximately 0.5108, so x_60 ≈ 0.5108 δ.

Wait, but the question is asking for the 10% and 60% depth of penetrations. So the 10% depth is at x = δ ln(10) ≈ 2.3 δ, and the 60% is at x ≈ 0.51 δ.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Wait, the 10% depth is the x where the amplitude is 10% of E0, so that's when E_y = 0.1 E0. So using the formula, x_10 is δ ln(10), which is about 2.3 δ. Similarly, for 60% depth, x_60 is δ ln(5/3) ≈ 0.51 δ.

Wait no, wait. Wait, the 10% depth of penetration is the distance where the amplitude is 10% of the initial. So E_y = 0.1 E0 occurs at x = δ ln(10) ≈ 2.3 δ. So the 10% depth is 2.3 δ, and 60% depth is 0.51 δ.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option H: 10% is 0.51 δ, 60% is 2.3 δ. That's swapped. Option H: 10% depth is 0.51 δ, 60% is 2.3 δ. No, that's opposite.

Wait, wait. No, no, wait. Wait, let me double-check. If x increases, the amplitude decreases. So at x=0, E=E0. At x=δ, E=E0 e^{-1} ≈ 0.3679 E0. So 36.79% amplitude.

So the 10% amplitude is at x where e^{-x/δ}=0.1 → x= δ ln(10) ≈ 2.3 δ. So the 10% depth is 2.3 δ, and the 60% amplitude is when e^{-x/δ}=0.6 → x= δ ln(100/60)= δ ln(5/3) ≈ 0.5108 δ.

So 10% is 2.3 δ, 60% is 0.51 δ.

Looking at the options:

Option H says 10% is 0.51 δ, 60% is 2.3 δ. So that's the reverse. So no.

Option C says 10% is 2.3 δ, 60% is 0.51 δ. Wait, option C says 10% is 2.3 δ, 60% is 0.51 δ. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 10% depth is 2.3 δ, 60% is 0.51 δ.

So that matches what I calculated. So the correct answer would be option H if it were reversed, but option C has the right numbers. Let me look again.

Wait, the options are:

A: 10% is 0.3δ, 60% is 1δ.

B:10% is δ, 60% is 3δ.

C:10% is2.3δ,60% is0.51δ.

D:10% is0.1δ,60% is0.6δ.

E:10% is0.1δ,60% is0.3δ.

F:10% is1.23δ,60% is0.56δ.

G:10% is3δ,60% is1.8δ.

H:10% is0.51δ,60% is2.3δ.

I:10% is1.5δ,60% is0.9δ.

J:10% is0.23δ,60% is1.2δ.

So option C says 10% is 2.3 δ, 60% is 0.51 δ. That's correct according to my calculation.

Wait, but wait, the question is phrased as "depth of penetration of an electromagnetic wave". Wait, in some contexts, the penetration depth is defined as the distance where the amplitude drops by a factor of 1/e, which is about 37%, but the question here is asking for specific percentages: 10% and 60% depth.

So the way I did the calculation, 10% is at 2.3 δ, and 60% is at 0.51 δ.

So the correct option is option C.

The problem involves determining the 10% and 60% depth of penetration for an electromagnetic wave described by the amplitude equation \( E_y = E_0 e^{-x/\delta} \), where \( \delta \) is the skin depth. The depth of penetration is the distance \( x \) at which the amplitude drops to a specified percentage of its initial value.

To find the 10% depth of penetration (\( x_{10} \)) and the 60% depth of penetration (\( x_{60} \)), the following steps are used:

1. **For 10% depth of penetration**:
   - Set \( E_y = 0.1 E_0 \).
   - Solve \( 0.1 = e^{-x_{10}/\delta} \).
   - Take the natural logarithm: \( \ln(0.1) = -x_{10}/\delta \).
   - Rearrange: \( x_{10} = \delta \ln(10) \approx 2.3 \delta \).

2. **For 60% depth of penetration**:
   - Set \( E_y = 0.6 E_0 \).
   - Solve \( 0.6 = e^{-x_{60}/\delta} \).
   - Take the natural logarithm: \( \ln(0.6) = -x_{60}/\delta \).
   - Rearrange: \( x_{60} = \delta \ln(100/60) \approx 0.51 \delta \).

Comparing these results with the provided options, the correct choice is:

- **10% depth of penetration**: \( 2.3 \delta \)
- **60% depth of penetration**: \( 0.51 \delta \)

This matches **Option C**.
