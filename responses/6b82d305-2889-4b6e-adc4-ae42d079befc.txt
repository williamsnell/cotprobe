Okay, so I have this question about the Gilgamesh epic and when the Old Babylonian version was modified into the standard version. I'm a bit rusty on my ancient history, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Gilgamesh is one of the oldest known literary works, written in cuneiform. The Old Babylonian period is an important time for this text. I think the standard version refers to the one that was later found, maybe the one that includes the flood story. 

Wait, the question is about when the Old Babylonian version was modified into the standard. So I need to figure out the timeline. The Old Babylonian period itself was around the early second millennium BCE, roughly 2000-1600 BCE, I believe. 

The standard version, often associated with the Code of Hammurabi, which was around the mid-first millennium BCE. Wait, no, Hammurabi was around 18th century BCE, which is still Old Babylonian. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up dates. 

I recall that the standard version, sometimes called the "Standard Babylonian Version," was compiled around the 12th or 11th century BCE. That would be toward the end of the second millennium BCE, right? Because the second millennium BCE ends around 1000 BCE. So that would be option C: Toward the end of the second millennium BCE.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The Old Babylonian period is earlier, like around 1800-1600 BCE. The standard version might have been a later compilation, maybe during the Kassite period or the Neo-Babylonian period. Wait, the Neo-Babylonian is later, around 600 BCE, which is first millennium. So maybe I'm getting it wrong.

Another angle: the standard version is often linked with the name of Sin-liqe-unninni, a Babylonian writer from around the 12th century BCE. That's the late second millennium, so option C again. 

Alternatively, some sources might say it was during the middle of the first millennium BCE, but I think that's more for later versions or translations, like the Assyrian versions. 

So, considering all that, I think the correct answer is C: Toward the end of the second millennium BCE.

The Old Babylonian version of the Gilgamesh epic was modified into the standard version during the late second millennium BCE, specifically around the 12th century BCE. This aligns with option C.

Answer: C
