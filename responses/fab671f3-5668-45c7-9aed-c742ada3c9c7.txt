Okay, so I need to find the ratio of 96 runners to 216 swimmers in the simplest form. Hmm, ratios can sometimes trip me up, but I think I remember that the simplest form is when you divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor, right?

Let me start by writing down the ratio as 96:216. Now, I need to simplify this. The first step is to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 96 and 216. Wait, what's the GCF again? It's the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. 

Let me think about the factors of 96. 96 is 16 times 6, which is 2^5 * 3. And 216 is 6^3, which is 2^3 * 3^3. So the common factors are 2^3 and 3^1. That means the GCF is 8 * 3 = 24. Wait, is that right? Let me check: 24 times 4 is 96, and 24 times 9 is 216. Yep, that's correct.

So now, I divide both numbers by 24. 96 divided by 24 is 4, and 216 divided by 24 is 9. So the simplified ratio is 4:9. Looking at the options, I see option H is 4 over 9, so that must be the answer.

Wait, let me double-check. Another way to simplify is by dividing both numbers by smaller common factors step by step. Let's see: 96 and 216 are both even, so divide by 2 to get 48:108. Still even, divide by 2 again: 24:54. Still even, divide by 2 once more: 12:27. Now, 12 and 27 can both be divided by 3: 4:9. Yep, same result. So H is definitely the right choice.

The ratio of 96 to 216 simplifies to 4:9 after dividing both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 24. 

Answer: H
