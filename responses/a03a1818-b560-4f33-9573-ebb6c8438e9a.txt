Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the strategies used by the Conservative government in 1979 to reduce the power of the labor movement. I'm a bit rusty on my UK history, but let me think this through.

The question is asking which option was NOT a strategy they used. The options are A through I. I remember that the 1979 Conservative government, led by Margaret Thatcher, implemented several measures to weaken the trade unions. These were part of what's sometimes called the "anti-union" legislation.

Let's go through each option one by one.

A: Making secondary action illegal. Secondary action is when workers support others, like striking in solidarity with another group. I think the government did make that illegal. So A was a strategy they used.

B: Enforcing mandatory arbitration in all labor disputes. Arbitration means having a third party decide disputes. I'm not entirely sure, but I think the government did introduce some arbitration measures to limit strikes, so B might have been used.

C: Banning political strikes not primarily about workers' conditions. Political strikes are those where workers strike for broader political reasons, not just their own pay or conditions. I recall that the government did pass laws against such strikes, so C was a strategy.

D: Imposing restrictions on picketing. Picketing is when workers picket outside a workplace to protest. The government definitely restricted this, so D was used.

E: Implementing a national minimum wage. Hmm, I'm not sure about this. I think the UK didn't have a national minimum wage until much later, maybe in the 90s. The 1979 government focused more on limiting union power rather than setting a wage floor. So E might not have been a strategy they used.

F: Making all strike action illegal. That seems too extreme. I don't think they made all strikes illegal, but maybe they made some types illegal. So F is probably not correct because they didn't outlaw all strikes, just specific actions like secondary strikes.

G: Outlawing collective bargaining. Collective bargaining is when unions negotiate with employers. I don't think they made this illegal. In fact, I believe unions still existed and could bargain, albeit with more restrictions. So G wasn't a strategy.

H: Replacing the labor movement with government-controlled worker's councils. That sounds like a more extreme measure. I'm not sure if they did this. Maybe not; I think they tried to limit the power of existing unions rather than replace them entirely. So H might not have been done.

I: Privatizing all industries. Privatization was a big part of Thatcher's policies, especially in the 80s and 90s. But in 1979, I think the focus was more on union power rather than full privatization. Though some privatization did happen, maybe not all industries. So I'm not certain about I.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to recall. The 1979 government introduced the Employment Protection Act and the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act. These acts did things like restrict secondary picketing, make strikes over political issues illegal, and require ballots for strikes. So looking at the options:

A: Yes, secondary action was made illegal.
B: Mandatory arbitration? I'm not sure. Maybe not all disputes, but perhaps in certain cases.
C: Yes, political strikes were banned.
D: Yes, restrictions on picketing.
E: No national minimum wage.
F: Not all strikes illegal, but some types.
G: No, collective bargaining wasn't outlawed.
H: No, they didn't replace unions with government councils.
I: Some privatization, but not all industries.

So the question is which was NOT a strategy. E and F and G and H and I are possibilities.

Wait, looking back, E: implementing a national minimum wage. I'm pretty sure the UK didn't have a national minimum wage in the late 70s. It was introduced much later, maybe in 1999. So E wasn't a strategy used.

Similarly, G: outlawing collective bargaining. That didn't happen; unions could still engage in collective bargaining, though it was made harder.

F: Making all strike action illegal. That's not correct because the government allowed some strikes, just not secondary ones or political ones.

So the options that were NOT strategies include E, F, G, H, I.

Looking back at the options, the question is which was NOT used. So the correct answer would be the one that wasn't part of their strategies.

So E: implementing a national minimum wage. They didn't do that. Similarly, F, G, H, I might not have been done. But among the options, which is the correct one.

Wait, let me check:

The government in 1979 did not implement a national minimum wage. So E is not a strategy they used. So the question is which was NOT used, so E is the correct answer.

But wait, looking at the options again:

A: Yes, used.

B: Enforcing mandatory arbitration in all labor disputes. I'm not sure. Maybe they did this for certain industries, but I don't think it was mandatory for all.

C: Yes, used.

D: Yes, used.

E: Not used.

F: Not used (they didn't make all strikes illegal, only certain types).

G: Not used.

H: Not used.

I: Did they privatize all industries? I don't think so. They did start privatizing some, like utilities, but not all.

So the question is which was NOT a strategy. The options are E, F, G, H, I.

But looking at the options again, the question asks which was NOT used. So the correct answer is E, F, G, H, or I.

Wait, the answer options are A to I, and the question is which was NOT used. So the correct answer is E: implementing a national minimum wage, because that wasn't done in 1979.

The Conservative government of 1979 under Margaret Thatcher implemented several strategies to reduce the power of the labor movement, such as making secondary action illegal, restricting picketing, banning political strikes, and enforcing mandatory arbitration in certain cases. However, they did not implement a national minimum wage, as that policy was introduced much later. Therefore, the correct answer is:

E

Answer:
E
