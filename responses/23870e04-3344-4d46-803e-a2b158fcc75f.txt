Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about greedy algorithms, and I need to figure out which of the given problems can be solved by a standard greedy approach. Let me break it down step by step.

The question lists three problems: I, II, and III. I need to evaluate each one to see if a greedy algorithm applies. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct combination.

First, let's recall what a greedy algorithm is. A greedy algorithm makes the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. It's typically used for optimization problems. But not all problems can be solved with a greedy approach; some require dynamic programming or other methods.

Problem I: Finding a minimum spanning tree (MST) in an undirected graph with positive-integer edge weights. Hmm, I remember that Krusky's and Prim's algorithms are used for MSTs. Both are greedy algorithms. Krusky's, for example, sorts the edges by weight and adds the smallest edges that don't form a cycle. So yes, problem I can be solved with a greedy approach.

Problem II: Finding a maximum clique in an undirected graph. A clique is a subset of nodes where every two distinct nodes are connected by an edge. The maximum clique is the largest such subset. I think this is a classic NP-hard problem. Greedy algorithms for this don't always yield the correct solution because they make a locally optimal choice, which might not lead to the global maximum. For example, a greedy approach might pick the first node with the highest degree, but that doesn't guarantee the largest clique. So problem II can't be reliably solved by a standard greedy algorithm.

Problem III: Finding a maximum flow from a source to a sink in a directed graph with positive capacities. The standard approach here is the Ford-Fulkerson method, which uses a greedy strategy. It repeatedly finds augmenting paths (like the shortest path in terms of available capacity) and increases the flow until no more augmenting paths are left. The max-flow min-cut theorem ensures this works, so yes, problem III can be solved with a greedy algorithm, particularly using the Ford-Fulkerson or Edmonds-Karp algorithms.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about problem III. Ford-Fulkerson is more of a general method, but is it considered a greedy algorithm? I think it's often implemented with a greedy approach, like using BFS to find the shortest augmenting path each time, which is a greedy choice. So yes, it's a greedy method.

So to summarize:
I: Yes (greedy)
II: No (NP-hard, not solvable by standard greedy)
III: Yes (greedy via Ford-Fulkerson or similar)

Looking at the options, the correct answer should include I and III. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A: None
B: III only
C: All three
D: III and II, but not I
E: I and II, but not III
F: I and II only
G: II only
H: II and III
I: I only
J: I and III only

So the correct answer is J: I and III only.

The correct answer is J: I and III only.
