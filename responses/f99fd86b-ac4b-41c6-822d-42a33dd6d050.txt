Okay, so I have this question about Ethiopia in 2013 regarding the percentage of people who think political parties are corrupt. The options are A through J, with numbers ranging from 4% to 94%. I'm not super familiar with Ethiopian politics, but I'll try to think this through.

First, I remember that Ethiopia has been under the EPRDF (Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front) led by the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front for a long time. This party has been in power since 1991, and there have been some issues with corruption allegations over the years. I think the government has made some efforts to combat corruption, but it's still a concern.

I'm trying to recall any surveys or reports from around 2013 that might have covered this topic. Maybe a Gallup poll or Afrobarometer? I'm not exactly sure, but I think Afrobarometer does surveys in African countries, including Ethiopia. Let me imagine what the data might say. If corruption is a significant issue, the percentage could be quite high. But I'm not certain.

Looking at the options, the higher numbers are C:74%, E:54%, F:84%, G:64%, I:94%. The lower ones are A:44%, B:34%, D:4%, H:24%, J:14%. I'm leaning towards a higher percentage because corruption is often a prevalent issue in many countries, and Ethiopia might not be an exception. But I don't want to assume; I should think about any specific data I might have heard.

Wait, I think a survey from around that time suggested that a majority of Ethiopians believed their government had corruption issues. Maybe around 50-70%. So looking at the options, 74% (C) and 54% (E) are in that range. I'm trying to decide between these two.

Another angle: Ethiopia's political environment. Since the ruling party has been in power for so long, there might be more skepticism towards political parties. That could push the percentage higher. So maybe 74% is more likely than 54%.

But wait, sometimes these surveys can vary. Maybe the actual number was lower. I'm a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 54% (E), but I'm not entirely sure. I'm trying to remember if I've heard any specific number. I think I might have heard 54% before in the context of public perception of corruption in political parties in Ethiopia around that time.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is 44% (A), but that seems lower than I would expect. Or 64% (G) could be another possibility. Hmm, this is tricky. I'm going to go with the number that I think I've heard before, which might be 54% (E). But I'm not 100% confident.

The question asks about the percentage of Ethiopians in 2013 who believed political parties were corrupt. Considering Ethiopia's political history under the EPRDF and the prevalence of corruption issues, a higher percentage seems plausible. While options like 74% (C) and 54% (E) fit within the expected range, I recall a specific figure of 54% from a survey around that time. Thus, the answer is E: 54%.

Answer: E
