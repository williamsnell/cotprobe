Okay, so I've got this economics problem here about production and costs. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says the price of labor is $2, and the price of capital is $1. The marginal product of labor is 200, and the marginal product of capital is 50. The question is asking what the firm should do. There are multiple options, A through J.

First, I remember that firms aim to maximize profits, which often involves optimizing the combination of inputs like labor and capital. I think this has to do with the marginal product per dollar for each input. 

So, the formula I recall is that the marginal product per unit cost should be equal for both inputs at the optimal point. So, we calculate the ratio of marginal product to price for each.

For labor: MP_L / Price_L = 200 / 2 = 100.
For capital: MP_K / Price_K = 50 / 1 = 50.

Hmm, so labor has a higher MP per dollar than capital. That means the firm is getting more output per dollar spent on labor compared to capital. I think the firm should adjust its inputs to equalize these ratios.

When the MP per dollar of labor is higher than that of capital, the firm should substitute more capital for labor. Because using more capital, which has a lower cost per unit of MP, would reduce costs and increase efficiency.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If labor is more efficient in terms of MP per dollar, the firm should use more labor and less capital to take advantage of the higher efficiency. Because each additional dollar spent on labor gives more output than each dollar on capital.

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me clarify: If MP_L / PL is greater than MP_K / PK, then the firm should increase the use of labor and decrease capital, because each additional unit of labor gives a better return relative to its cost compared to capital. This would continue until the two ratios are equal.

So in this case, since 100 > 50, the firm should use more labor and less capital. That way, they can lower their costs or increase output more efficiently.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one suggests increasing labor and decreasing capital. Let's scan through them.

Option A: Decrease capital and increase labor so that MP of capital falls and MP of labor rises. That sounds possible, but I'm not sure if that's necessarily the case.

Option B: Increase capital and decrease labor. No, that's the opposite of what I was thinking.

Option F: Keep labor constant and decrease capital. No, because we need to increase labor.

Option H: Decrease capital and increase labor, so that MP of capital rises and MP of labor falls. Hmm, why would MP of capital rise? If we decrease capital, MP might actually rise due to diminishing returns, but I'm not sure if that's the main point here.

Wait, maybe I should think about the marginal product per dollar. The idea is to use more of the input with a higher MP per dollar. So, since labor's MP per dollar is higher, the firm should increase labor and decrease capital.

Looking at the options, option A says decrease capital and increase labor. But the reasoning given is that MP of capital falls and labor's MP rises. But I'm not sure if that's the correct reasoning. The main point is to adjust until MP_L/PL = MP_K/PK.

Alternatively, perhaps the firm should increase labor until MP_L drops to match MP_K's ratio. So, when you increase labor, MP_L might decrease due to diminishing returns, and similarly, decreasing capital might cause MP_K to increase as capital becomes scarcer.

Wait, but in the initial state, MP_L is 200 and MP_K is 50. The ratios are 100 and 50. So, in this case, the firm should substitute labor for capital because labor is more efficient per dollar. So, increasing labor and decreasing capital. That would bring down the MP_L (since more labor leads to diminishing returns) and raise MP_K (since less capital means each unit is used more, so MP_K increases). So, the firm continues this until MP_L/2 = MP_K/1.

So, looking at the options, which one says increase labor and decrease capital. Let's check the options again.

Option A: Decrease capital and increase labor. Reasoning: MP of capital falls, MP of labor rises. Wait, but if you increase labor, MP_L might fall, not rise. Because adding more labor leads to diminishing returns. Similarly, decreasing capital may cause MP_K to rise.

Wait, that contradicts. So, if you decrease capital, MP_K increases. If you increase labor, MP_L decreases. So the correct adjustment would be to increase labor and decrease capital, leading to MP_L decreasing and MP_K increasing until they meet the condition MP_L/2 = MP_K/1.

But looking at the options, which one says that?

Option A says decrease capital and increase labor, causing MP of capital to fall and MP of labor to rise. Wait, that's the opposite of what I just thought. If you decrease capital, MP_K should rise, not fall. Because with less capital, each unit is more productive. Similarly, adding more labor would cause MP_L to fall due to diminishing returns.

So option A's reasoning is incorrect. It says MP_K falls and MP_L rises. That doesn't make sense because decreasing capital should increase MP_K, and increasing labor should decrease MP_L.

So which option correctly states the action? It's option A's action (decrease capital and increase labor) but the reasoning is wrong. The correct reasoning is that MP_K rises and MP_L falls.

Wait, let's look at all the options again.

Option H: Decrease capital and increase labor so that MP of capital rises and MP of labor falls. That matches what I was thinking. Because when you decrease capital, MP_K increases (rises), and when you increase labor, MP_L decreases (falls). So H is the correct action and reasoning.

Wait, but the question is what should the firm do? The action is correct in H, but let's check other options.

Option J: Increase capital and decrease labor. No, that's opposite.

Option A: The action is correct but the reasoning is wrong. The firm should decrease capital and increase labor, which is what H says, but H's reasoning is correct: MP_K rises and MP_L falls.

Wait, so the correct answer would be option H.

Wait, but in the initial ratios, MP_L/PL is 100 and MP_K/PK is 50. So the firm should use more labor and less capital. So, the correct action is to decrease capital and increase labor, as in option A, but the reasoning in A is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The firm should adjust inputs until MP_L/2 = MP_K/1. Currently, MP_L/2 is 100, and MP_K/1 is 50. So the firm should increase labor and decrease capital. Because when you increase labor, MP_L decreases (due to diminishing returns), and when you decrease capital, MP_K increases. So, the firm should do this until MP_L/2 equals MP_K/1.

So the correct action is to decrease capital and increase labor, which is option A's action, but option A's reasoning is that MP_K falls and MP_L rises. That's incorrect because decreasing capital should cause MP_K to rise, and increasing labor should cause MP_L to fall.

So, looking at the options again, option H says: Decrease capital and increase labor so that MP of capital rises and MP of labor falls. That's correct in both action and reasoning.

Wait, but the options are A through J. So option H is the correct choice.

Wait, but earlier I thought the action should be to increase labor and decrease capital, which is option A's action but with incorrect reasoning, whereas option H has the correct reasoning. So I think the correct answer is H.

Wait, but let me double-check. The optimal condition is when MP_L/PL = MP_K/PK. Here, 200/2 = 100, 50/1=50. So 100 >50, meaning that labor is more cost-effective. So the firm should increase labor and decrease capital until the ratios equalize.

So the correct action is to decrease capital and increase labor, which is option A's action, but the reasoning in A is wrong. Option H has the correct reasoning but the same action.

Wait, no, option H's action is to decrease capital and increase labor, which is correct, and the reasoning is correct because MP_K rises (since less capital is used, each unit is more productive) and MP_L falls (because more labor leads to diminishing returns).

So the correct answer is option H.

The firm should decrease capital and increase labor so that the marginal product of capital rises and the marginal product of labor falls. This adjustment ensures that the firm equalizes the marginal product per dollar of both inputs, optimizing resource allocation for profit maximization.

Answer: H
