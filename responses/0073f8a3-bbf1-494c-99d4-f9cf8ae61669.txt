Question:

A national distributor of windows selected a retailer to sell its windows in a specified geographic area. The parties negotiated a written distribution agreement, which stated that any order for windows placed by the retailer would be binding on the distributor "only when expressly accepted by the distributor." For the next two years, the retailer forwarded orders to the distributor, and the distributor always filled the orders. In the third year, the distributor accused the retailer of overcharging customers to install the distributor's windows. The retailer responded that the distributor had no control over the retailer's installation prices. When the distributor received the retailer's next order for windows, it refused to fill the order. If the retailer sues the distributor for breach of contract, will it be likely to prevail?

Options:

A: Yes, because the parties' course of dealing binds the distributor to fill the retailer's order.
B: No, because the agreement gave the distributor the right to expressly accept or reject orders.
C: Yes, because the distributor has always filled the orders in the past, creating an expectation of continued performance.
D: No, because the retailer's practice of overcharging customers excused the distributor's refusal to fill the order.
E: Yes, because the distributor cannot arbitrarily decide not to fill the retailer's orders.
F: Yes, because the distributor's claim regarding overcharging customers is independent of its obligation to fill the retailer's order.
G: No, because the retailer's forwarding of orders to the distributor did not give rise to an obligation on the distributor's part to fill the orders.
H: No, because the distributor has the right to refuse orders at any time according to the agreement.
I: No, because the distributor has the right to reject orders based on the retailer's pricing practices.
J: Yes, because the distributor did not expressly reject the retailer's orders.

Okay, so I have this question about contract law, specifically dealing with a distribution agreement between a national distributor and a retailer. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question says that the distributor and retailer have a written agreement. The key part is that any order placed by the retailer is only binding on the distributor when it's "expressly accepted" by the distributor. So, that means the distributor doesn't have to honor an order unless they explicitly say yes. If they don't accept it, the order isn't binding.

For the first two years, everything was fine. The retailer sent orders, and the distributor filled them every time. So, there's a history of the distributor always accepting the orders. In the third year, the distributor accuses the retailer of overcharging customers for installation. The retailer says that the installation prices are their own concern, not the distributor's.

Then, when the retailer sends another order, the distributor refuses to fill it. The retailer is suing for breach of contract. The question is whether the retailer will likely win.

Looking at the options, I need to figure out which legal principles apply here. The main issue seems to be about the terms of the contract and whether the distributor's refusal to fill the order constitutes a breach.

The agreement states that orders are only binding when "expressly accepted." So, the distributor isn't obligated to fill every order; they can choose to accept or reject each one. The fact that they accepted all previous orders doesn't create a binding obligation for them to keep doing so unless the contract says so.

In contract law, if a contract gives one party the right to accept or reject offers (in this case, orders), that party can exercise that right unless there's a specific reason that's been breached. The retailer's practice of overcharging might be a separate issue, but unless the contract prohibits that, it might not give the distributor the right to reject orders based on that.

Wait, but the contract here doesn't say anything about the retailer's pricing or installation practices. It just says that orders are only binding upon acceptance. So the distributor's reason for refusing the order (retailer overcharging) isn't directly tied to the contract terms unless that's a breach elsewhere.

So, the retailer is suing because the distributor didn't accept the order. But under the contract, the distributor has the right to accept or reject each order. Even if they've always accepted before, without a term that requires them to continue doing so, the retailer can't assume it's a done deal.

Therefore, the distributor's refusal isn't a breach because they have the right to refuse any order, as per the agreement. So the retailer's claim is unlikely to prevail.

Looking at the options:

Option B says No, because the agreement gave the distributor the right to accept or reject orders. That seems correct.

Option H also says No, because the distributor has the right to refuse orders according to the agreement. That's similar to B.

Wait, the difference between B and H is that B emphasizes the right to accept or reject, while H says the right to refuse. Both are correct, but the question is about whether the distributor's refusal is a breach. Since the agreement allows refusal, the answer is no.

So, the correct answer would be either B or H. Looking back at the question, the agreement states that orders are only binding when "expressly accepted." So, the distributor can choose not to accept (i.e., refuse) any order. Therefore, the distributor isn't obligated to fill the order, so the retailer can't claim breach because the distributor had the right to refuse.

So, options B and H both point to the distributor's right. But let me check the options again.

Option B: No, because the agreement gave the distributor the right to expressly accept or reject orders.

Option H: No, because the distributor has the right to refuse orders at any time according to the agreement.

Both seem correct, but perhaps B is more precise because it refers to the express acceptance or rejection as per the contract. So, B is more directly tied to the wording of the agreement.

Alternatively, H is also correct because it's based on the agreement's terms. But perhaps the correct answer is B or H. Wait, looking at the options again, I think H is correct because it directly states the distributor's right to refuse orders, which is what happened.

Wait, but the question is about whether the retailer will likely prevail. Since the distributor had a contractual right to refuse, the retailer won't win. So, the correct options are B, H, or I.

Wait, option I says No, because the distributor has the right to reject orders based on the retailer's pricing practices. But does the contract allow the distributor to reject based on pricing? The contract only says that orders are binding upon acceptance. It doesn't mention anything about pricing as a reason to reject. So the distributor's reason for refusing (retailer's pricing) might not be a valid reason under the contract. That is, unless the contract includes terms about pricing or conduct that the distributor can enforce.

But the problem states that the agreement only says orders are binding when accepted. There's no mention of any other conditions. Therefore, the distributor's right to refuse isn't based on the retailer's pricing but on their general right to accept or reject. So, the pricing issue might not be relevant to the breach of contract claim, unless the retailer's actions constitute a material breach of the contract elsewhere. But the question is about the distributor refusing to fill the order, not about the retailer's pricing practices being a breach.

So, the retailer's overcharging might be a separate issue, but it doesn't affect the distributor's right to refuse the order unless the contract ties order acceptance to pricing, which it doesn't.

Thus, the distributor's refusal isn't a breach because they have the right to refuse any order as per the agreement. Therefore, the retailer won't prevail. So, the correct answer is either B or H.

Option B says the agreement gave the right to accept or reject, making the distributor's refusal valid. Option H says the distributor has the right to refuse at any time according to the agreement.

I think both are correct, but perhaps H is more specific. However, looking back, the exact wording in the agreement is that orders are binding only when "expressly accepted." So, the distributor can choose to accept or reject each order. Therefore, the right to refuse is inherent in the agreement.

So, the correct answer is either B or H. But in the options, both are present. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, H is "No, because the distributor has the right to refuse orders at any time according to the agreement." That seems correct because the agreement allows the distributor to refuse.

Alternatively, B is "No, because the agreement gave the distributor the right to expressly accept or reject orders." Both B and H seem correct. But perhaps B is more accurate because it directly refers to the clause about express acceptance or rejection.

Wait, the agreement says orders are binding only when "expressly accepted." So, the distributor can choose to accept or not. Therefore, the right to refuse is part of that clause, making B correct.

So, the answer is B.
</think>

The agreement explicitly states that orders are only binding when "expressly accepted" by the distributor. This means the distributor has the right to accept or reject orders at their discretion. The retailer's history of placing orders and the distributor filling them does not create a binding obligation for the distributor to continue doing so unless the contract specifies otherwise. The distributor's refusal to fill the order is exercising their contractual right to reject orders, which is allowed under the agreement. Therefore, the retailer's claim for breach of contract is unlikely to prevail.

Answer: B
