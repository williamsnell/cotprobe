Question:

A bin has 5 green balls and $k$ purple balls in it, where $k$ is an unknown positive integer. A ball is drawn at random from the bin.

B: 7
C: 12
D: 3
E: 10
F: 4

Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure out the value of k. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

Alright, the setup: there's a bin with 5 green balls and k purple balls. So the total number of balls is 5 + k. When you draw a ball, if it's green, you win $2, and if it's purple, you lose $2. The expected amount won is 50 cents, which is $0.50. I need to find the value of k from the given options.

Hmm, expected value. Right, expected value is like the average outcome if you were to play many times. So I remember that the formula for expected value is the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability.

So let's break it down. The probability of drawing a green ball is the number of green balls divided by the total number of balls. That would be 5/(5+k). Similarly, the probability of drawing a purple ball is k/(5+k).

The payoffs are $2 for green and -$2 for purple because losing $2 is like earning negative two dollars. So, the expected value E can be calculated as:

E = (Probability of green * payoff for green) + (Probability of purple * payoff for purple)

Plugging in the numbers:

E = [5/(5+k)] * 2 + [k/(5+k)] * (-2)

We know that E is $0.50, so:

0.50 = [5/(5+k)] * 2 + [k/(5+k)] * (-2)

Let me write that equation out clearly:

0.5 = (5 * 2)/(5 + k) + (k * (-2))/(5 + k)

Simplifying each term:

First term: (10)/(5 + k)
Second term: (-2k)/(5 + k)

So combining them:

0.5 = [10 - 2k]/(5 + k)

Now, I can write this as:

0.5 = (10 - 2k)/(5 + k)

To solve for k, I'll multiply both sides by (5 + k) to get rid of the denominator:

0.5 * (5 + k) = 10 - 2k

Let's compute the left side:

0.5 * 5 = 2.5
0.5 * k = 0.5k
So, 2.5 + 0.5k = 10 - 2k

Now, I'll get all the terms involving k on one side and constants on the other. Let's add 2k to both sides:

2.5 + 0.5k + 2k = 10

Which simplifies to:

2.5 + 2.5k = 10

Now, subtract 2.5 from both sides:

2.5k = 10 - 2.5
2.5k = 7.5

Divide both sides by 2.5:

k = 7.5 / 2.5
k = 3

Wait, that gives k=3. Let me check the options. Option D is 3. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, let's go back through the steps.

Starting with the expected value equation:

0.5 = [10 - 2k]/(5 + k)

Multiply both sides by (5 + k):

0.5*(5 + k) = 10 - 2k

Which is 2.5 + 0.5k = 10 - 2k

Adding 2k to both sides:

2.5 + 2.5k = 10

Subtract 2.5:

2.5k = 7.5

Divide by 2.5:

k = 3

Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check if I set up the expected value correctly.

The expected value E is (5/(5+k))*2 + (k/(5+k))*(-2) = 0.5

Yes, that looks right. So substituting k=3, let's verify.

Total balls would be 5 +3=8.

Probability of green: 5/8, so expected gain is (5/8)*2 = 10/8 = 1.25

Probability of purple: 3/8, so expected loss is (3/8)*(-2) = -6/8 = -0.75

Total expected value: 1.25 -0.75 = 0.5, which is 50 cents. So that checks out.

So k=3, which is option D.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 3. So that's the answer. But let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

Alternatively, maybe I should try substituting another option to see if it works. Let's pick option A, which is 5.

If k=5, total balls 10.

Probability green: 5/10=0.5. Expected gain: 0.5*2=1.

Probability purple:5/10=0.5. Expected loss:0.5*(-2)=-1.

Total E: 1 -1 =0, which is not 0.5. So A is wrong.

Option D: k=3, as above, gives E=0.5, correct.

So yeah, I think the correct answer is D:3.

The expected value equation is set up correctly, leading to k=3 after solving. Verification shows it satisfies the condition.
