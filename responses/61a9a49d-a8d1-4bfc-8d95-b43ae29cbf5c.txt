Question:

A television picture is composed of approximately 300,000 individual picture elements, each of which can attain ten different and distinguishable brightness levels (such as black and shades of gray) for proper contrast. If, for any picture element, the probability of occurrence of the ten brightness levels are equal, and 30 picture frames are being transmitted per second, determine the bandwidth of the T.V. video signal.

Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the bandwidth of a TV video signal. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.

The question says that a TV picture is made up of around 300,000 individual picture elements, or pixels. Each of these pixels can have ten different brightness levels. So each pixel isn't just black and white; it's got ten shades, like varying levels of gray. That makes sense because more levels mean better contrast and picture quality.

The problem states that each brightness level has an equal probability of occurring. So for each pixel, each of the ten brightness levels has a 1/10 chance. That's a uniform distribution, I think. No brightness level is more common than others.

Now, the question mentions that 30 picture frames are transmitted per second. So the frame rate is 30 FPS. That's a common frame rate for TV, I believe. So each second, 30 complete frames are sent.

The main goal is to find the bandwidth of the TV video signal. I remember that bandwidth in communication systems relates to the range of frequencies needed to transmit a signal. The higher the bandwidth, the more data can be transmitted per second.

Wait, but how do I calculate bandwidth here? I think I need to use some formula from information theory or signal processing. Oh right, the bandwidth can be related to the bit rate and the required signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The SNR here is given as 1000, which is 30 dB. That's a pretty high SNR, so the signal is much stronger than the noise, which is good for clear transmission.

Hmm, the formula I'm trying to recall is the Shannon-Hartley theorem, which gives the maximum data rate for a given bandwidth and SNR. The formula is C = B * log₂(1 + SNR), where C is the channel capacity in bits per second, B is the bandwidth in Hz, and SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I can directly apply this here. Let me think again. The problem is about the video signal's bandwidth, so maybe I should approach it differently. Oh, perhaps I should calculate the total number of bits per second (bit rate) needed to transmit the video and then determine the bandwidth based on that.

So, the video signal's bit rate can be calculated by considering the number of pixels, the number of brightness levels, and the frame rate. Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the number of bits per pixel.
2. Multiply by the number of pixels to get bits per frame.
3. Multiply by the frame rate to get bits per second (bit rate).
4. Then, use the SNR and the bit rate to find the required bandwidth using the Shannon formula.

Let me go through each step.

1. Bits per pixel: Since each pixel has 10 brightness levels, the number of bits per pixel is log2(10) bits. Because each brightness level is a different value, the number of possible levels is 10, so the number of bits needed is the base-2 logarithm of that. Log2(10) is approximately 3.3219 bits per pixel.

2. Bits per frame: The total number of pixels per frame is 300,000. So, 300,000 pixels multiplied by 3.3219 bits per pixel. Let me compute that: 300,000 * 3.3219 ≈ 996,570 bits per frame. Wait, that's about a million bits per frame.

3. Bit rate: Since there are 30 frames per second, multiply the bits per frame by 30. So, 996,570 * 30 ≈ 29,897,100 bits per second. That's roughly 29.9 million bits per second, or about 30 Mbps.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. 300,000 * 3.3219 = 300,000 * 3 is 900,000, plus 300,000 * 0.3219. 0.3219 * 300,000 is approximately 96,570. So total is about 996,570 bits per frame. Multiply by 30 gives 29,897,100 bps, which is 29.8971 Mbps. Let me round that to 30 Mbps for simplicity.

Now, using the Shannon-Hartley theorem, the maximum data rate C is B * log2(1 + SNR). We have C as 30 Mbps, and SNR is 1000. So, let's plug in the numbers.

C = B * log2(1 + 1000) = B * log2(1001). Let me calculate log2(1001). I know that 2^10 is 1024, which is close to 1001. So, log2(1001) is slightly less than 10. Let me compute it more accurately. Using natural logarithm approximation: log2(x) = ln(x)/ln(2). So ln(1001)/ln(2) ≈ 6.9078 / 0.6931 ≈ 9.9658. So approximately 9.966.

So, C = B * 9.966. We have C = 30e6 bits per second. So:

30e6 = B * 9.966 → B = 30e6 / 9.966 ≈ 3,009,036 Hz. That's about 3.009 MHz. Looking at the options, option G is 3 MHz, which is very close. So the answer should be G: 3MHz.

Wait, but wait a minute. Did I miss any steps? Let me think again. The problem states that the TV video signal's bandwidth is to be determined. So perhaps I should be using Nyquist's theorem or another formula. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, another approach: The bandwidth can also be calculated using the formula for the number of possible symbols per second. The formula is B = (2 * N * log2(V)) / T, where N is the number of levels, V is the number of possible values per symbol, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is B = (number of bits per second) / (2 * log2(V)), but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the total information per second and then the bandwidth required to transmit that information with the given SNR. So using the Shannon formula makes sense here. Since C = B * log2(1 + SNR), and C is the data rate, which I calculated as 30 Mbps, then B = C / log2(1 + SNR).

Wait, but wait, I think I might have miscalculated the data rate. Let me go back.

The number of bits per frame is 300,000 pixels multiplied by log2(10) bits per pixel, which is 300,000 * 3.3219 ≈ 996,570 bits per frame. Then, 30 frames per second: 996,570 * 30 ≈ 29,897,100 bits per second, which is approximately 30 Mbps. That seems correct.

So using C = 30e6 bps, SNR = 1000, so log2(1001) ≈ 9.966. Therefore, B = 30e6 / 9.966 ≈ 3.009 MHz. So that's approximately 3 MHz, which is option G.

But wait, some sources say that for a TV channel, the bandwidth is often calculated using the formula B = (2 * N * R) / (log2(V)), where R is the symbol rate and V is the number of possible symbols. But I'm not entirely sure if that applies here. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is B = (number of bits per second) / (2 * log2(V)), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a simpler approach, considering each pixel's transmission as a symbol. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another way: the total number of bits per second is 300,000 pixels * 3.3219 bits/pixel * 30 frames/s. That's 300,000 * 3.3219 = 996,570 bits/frame, times 30 is 29,897,100 bits/s, so 29.8971 Mbps. Now, the required SNR is 1000, so using C = B * log2(1+SNR), rearranged to B = C / log2(1+SNR).

So, B = 29.8971e6 / 9.966 ≈ 3.009e6 Hz, or 3.009 MHz. So option G is 3 MHz, which is the closest.

Another thought: Wait, in TV systems, the bandwidth is often related to the Nyquist rate. The Nyquist rate is twice the highest frequency component. But I'm not sure how that applies here because the problem doesn't give a specific frequency of the video signal. It's more about the data rate and SNR.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the total number of possible transitions or something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the data rate calculation. Let me check again.

Each pixel has 10 brightness levels, so the number of bits per pixel is log2(10) ≈ 3.3219 bits. So for 300,000 pixels per frame, that's 300,000 * 3.3219 ≈ 996,570 bits per frame. At 30 frames per second, that's 996,570 * 30 ≈ 29,897,100 bits/s, which is about 30 Mbps.

Yes, that seems correct. So using the Shannon formula, C = B * log2(1+SNR), so B = C / log2(1001) ≈ 30e6 / 9.966 ≈ 3.009 MHz. So the answer is G: 3MHz.

Wait, but looking back, the options have C as 6 MHz. Why is that? Did I miss something? Let me think again. Oh, perhaps I made a mistake in the data rate calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, 300,000 pixels per frame times 30 frames per second gives 9,000,000 pixels per second. Each pixel is 3.3219 bits, so 9,000,000 * 3.3219 ≈ 29,897,100 bits per second. Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the number of brightness levels as 10, so each pixel is 4 bits (since 2^4=16, which is more than 10, but that's not necessary; it's 3.32 bits). Hmm.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the problem is using the formula for bandwidth as B = (2 * f * N) where f is the frame rate and N is the number of lines, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the bandwidth is determined by the number of pixels, frame rate, and the number of brightness levels, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the total number of bits per second divided by the SNR. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the formula B = (number of bits per second) / (SNR in dB converted to ratio). Wait, but SNR in dB is 30 dB, which is 10^(30/10) = 1000, so 1000. So, perhaps using B = (bits per second) / (2 * SNR), but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for QAM modulation, where the bandwidth is related to the symbol rate and the number of bits per symbol. But without more information, I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: The problem might be using the formula for the minimum bandwidth required to transmit a signal with a certain data rate and SNR using binary modulation. In that case, the bandwidth would be B = C / (2 * log2(1 + SNR)). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, let me think again. The Shannon formula says C = B * log2(1 + SNR). So, if I have C and SNR, I can solve for B. So, C is 30e6 bits/s, SNR is 1000.

So, log2(1001) ≈ 9.966. So, B = 30e6 / 9.966 ≈ 3.009e6 Hz, which is 3.009 MHz, so option G is 3 MHz.

Yes, that seems correct. So I think the answer is G.
</think>

To determine the bandwidth of the TV video signal, we start by calculating the bit rate required to transmit the video. Each pixel has 10 brightness levels, so the number of bits per pixel is log₂(10) ≈ 3.3219 bits. With 300,000 pixels per frame, the total bits per frame are:

\[
300,000 \, \text{pixels/frame} \times 3.3219 \, \text{bits/pixel} \approx 996,570 \, \text{bits/frame}.
\]

At 30 frames per second, the bit rate is:

\[
996,570 \, \text{bits/frame} \times 30 \, \text{frames/second} \approx 29,897,100 \, \text{bits/second} \, (\text{approximately } 30 \, \text{Mbps}).
\]

Using the Shannon-Hartley theorem, the channel capacity \( C \) is related to the bandwidth \( B \) and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by:

\[
C = B \cdot \log_2(1 + \text{SNR}).
\]

Given \( C = 30 \, \text{Mbps} \) and \( \text{SNR} = 1000 \), we calculate:

\[
\log_2(1001) \approx 9.966.
\]

Rearranging for \( B \):

\[
B = \frac{C}{\log_2(1 + \text{SNR})} = \frac{30 \times 10^6}{9.966} \approx 3.009 \, \text{MHz}.
\]

Thus, the bandwidth required is approximately 3 MHz, corresponding to option G.
