Okay, so I've got this question about the velocity of money. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question says.

The total value of all transactions in the U.S. is $100,000, and the money supply is $10,000. I need to find the velocity of money. Wait, velocity of money... I remember it's related to how quickly money circulates in the economy. 

From what I recall, the formula for velocity of money is the total value of transactions divided by the money supply. Oh right, the formula is V = T / M, where T is the total transactions and M is the money supply. 

So, plugging the numbers in, T is $100,000 and M is $10,000. Let me do the division: 100,000 divided by 10,000. That should be 10, right? Because 10,000 times 10 is 100,000. 

Wait, but I should double-check. Sometimes these terms can be confusing. Velocity of money measures how many times a dollar is used to make purchases in a given period. So if the total transactions are high and money supply is low, the velocity is high because each dollar is used more often. 

Yes, so 100,000 / 10,000 is definitely 10. Looking at the options, J is 10. That must be the answer.

The velocity of money is calculated by dividing the total value of transactions by the money supply. Using the formula \( V = \frac{T}{M} \), where \( T = \$100,000 \) and \( M = \$10,000 \), we get \( V = \frac{100,000}{10,000} = 10 \).

Answer: J
