Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about World War II and psychology concepts. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking about why millions of Jews and other minorities were slaughtered because they were blamed for Germany's problems. It says this illustrates a certain psychological concept, and I need to pick from options A to J.

First, I remember that during WWII, the Nazis used Jews as scapegoats for Germany's economic and social issues. Scapegoating is a term I've heard before; it's when a group is blamed for problems others face. But I need to connect this to a psychological defense mechanism.

Looking at the options, I think about each term. Sour grapes and sweet lemons rationalization are types of rationalization. Sour grapes is when you dismiss something you can't have as not being good anyway. Sweet lemons is when you convince yourself that what you have is good. But here, it's about blaming others, so maybe not these.

Sublimation is redirecting unacceptable impulses into acceptable activities. Not sure that's it. Rationalization is making excuses for behavior, but I think it's broader than that. Projection is attributing your own feelings or thoughts to someone else. Oh wait, that might fit. Like, if a country is feeling insecure, they project their blame onto others.

Wait, no, projection is more about taking your own negative traits and blaming others for them. So if Germans were feeling guilty or insecure, they might project their own issues onto the Jews. That makes sense. So the act of blaming others for their problems is projection.

Looking at the other options: reaction formation is when you act opposite to your feelings, repression is pushing thoughts away, denial is refusing to accept reality. Displacement is redirecting feelings from one target to another, like taking out anger on a safer person. Regression is going back to an earlier stage of development. None of these seem to fit as well as projection.

So the answer should be E: projection.

The act of blaming Jews and other minorities for Germany's problems during WWII is an example of projection, where the perpetrators attribute their own negative feelings or issues onto others. 

Answer: E
