Okay, so Tom bought a bicycle for $80 and sold it after 4 years for $15. I need to figure out the annual depreciation using the straight line method and the annual rate of depreciation. Hmm, let me think step by step.

First, depreciation is the decrease in value over time. The straight line method means the depreciation is the same each year. So I should calculate the total depreciation and then divide by the number of years.

The initial cost was $80, and he sold it for $15. So the total depreciation is $80 - $15 = $65 over 4 years. To find the annual depreciation, I divide $65 by 4. Let me do that: 65 รท 4 equals 16.25. So the annual depreciation is $16.25 per year.

Next, the rate of depreciation. The rate is usually a percentage based on the original cost. So I take the annual depreciation amount, $16.25, and divide it by the original cost, $80. That gives 16.25 รท 80. Let me calculate that: 16.25 divided by 80 is 0.203125, which is 20.3125%. Rounding that, it's approximately 20.3%.

Looking at the options, option B is $16.25 per year and 20.3%, which matches my calculations. So I think the answer is B.

The annual depreciation is calculated as $65 over 4 years, which is $16.25 per year. The rate is 20.3%. 

Answer: B
