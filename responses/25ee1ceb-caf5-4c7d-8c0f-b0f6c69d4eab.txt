Question:

A housing corporation owned a tract of land and prepared a development plan to divide the land into 100 lots and create a residential community on the property. The Declaration of Covenants created the community association, an administrative entity that would administer and enforce the regulations' and restrictions recited in the Declaration of Covenants. One of the restrictions reads:"There shall never at any time be erected, permitted, or maintained upon any part of the property any structure designed for or used as a saloon or place for the sale or manufacture of malt, vinous, or spirituous liquors. "The Declaration of Covenants was duly recorded and was included in the deed taken by a psychologist when he purchased lot 24 in the housing development. The psychologist recorded his deed. The psychologist gave his lot to his son. The deed conveying lot 24 to the son contained no reference to the Declaration of Covenants or any of its provisions. The deed provided that "these premises are conveyed to (the son), his heirs, and assigns, as long as they are used for residential purposes only. " The son did not record his deed. The son was unaware of the Declaration of Covenants. The son started a home business selling imported wine from his home. A geologist, the owner of lot 26, which was situated next to the son's lot, brought an action of ejectment against the son. Which of the following is the best argument for the son?

Options:

A: Not having been recorded, the condition cannot be enforced against the son.
B: The son's business does not qualify as a saloon or place for manufacture of liquors.
C: The law prohibits a fee simple determinable.
D: The deed to the son created a fee simple determinable with a possibility of reverter, giving the psychologist, but not the geologist, the right to sue the son.
E: The geologist is entitled only to an injunction against the son.
F: The son was not aware of the Declaration of Covenants, thus should not be held accountable.
G: The psychologist did not explicitly forbid the sale of alcohol in the deed to the son.
H: The geologist has no right to sue as the son's business does not affect him directly.
I: The prohibition in the Declaration of Covenants does not apply as the son did not purchase the lot.

Okay, so I need to figure out the best argument the son can make in this situation. Let me try to break down the scenario step by step.

First, there's a housing corporation that owns land and divides it into 100 lots. They create a Declaration of Covenants which sets up a community association to enforce certain rules and restrictions. One of these restrictions says that you can't build or use any part of the property as a saloon or for selling or making alcohol. This Declaration was recorded, which is important because recording makes it part of the public record and legally binding on future owners.

The psychologist bought lot 24 and included the Declaration in his deed. He then conveyed this lot to his son. However, the son's deed doesn't mention the Declaration of Covenants or its restrictions. Instead, it just says the premises are conveyed for residential purposes only. The son didn't record his deed either. The son starts a home business selling imported wine, which probably involves some storage and sales from his home. The geologist, who owns lot 26 next door, sues to eject the son.

So, what's the issue here? It seems like the geologist is claiming that the son is violating the covenant by operating a business that sells wine, which might fall under the prohibition of selling liquor.

Looking at the options:

Option A says that since the Declaration wasn't recorded in the son's deed, it can't be enforced against him. But wait, the Declaration was recorded when the psychologist bought it, and the son's deed was based on the psychologist's deed, which did include the Declaration. So, recording once is enough for subsequent purchasers; the fact that the son didn't record his deed doesn't mean the Declaration is off the hook. Plus, the son had constructive notice because the Declaration was recorded.

Option B argues that the son's business isn't a saloon or a manufacturing place. But selling imported wine could be seen as selling liquor, even if it's not a traditional saloon. It depends on how the court interprets it. But the restriction is broad, so maybe this isn't the strongest argument.

Option C talks about the law prohibiting a fee simple determinable. I'm not sure what that refers to here. The Declaration creates a covenant, not a fee simple determinable. A fee simple determinable would have a specific condition that automatically ends the estate, but this seems more like a restrictive covenant.

Option D suggests the deed to the son was a fee simple determinable with a possibility of reverter, giving only the psychologist the right to sue. But the deed to the son says "as long as they are used for residential purposes only," which sounds like a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, not a determinable fee. Also, the Declaration's restrictions are in the community association, so the right to enforce might not just belong to the psychologist.

Option E says the geologist is only entitled to an injunction, not ejectment. But the geologist is suing for ejectment, which is a possessory action. The covenant might allow for that, so E might not be the best argument.

Option F claims the son wasn't aware of the Declaration, so he shouldn't be held accountable. But in property law, notice isn't required for recorded documents. The son had constructive notice because the Declaration was recorded. So F is probably not a valid argument.

Option G points out that the psychologist didn't explicitly forbid alcohol in the son's deed. But the Declaration was part of the original deed, and the son's deed still subject to the Declaration unless it's excluded. The son's deed says "residential purposes only," but the Declaration's restrictions are separate. So G might have some merit, but I'm not sure if it's the best.

Option H says the geologist can't sue because the son's business doesn't affect him directly. But restrictive covenants typically run with the land, and any violation can be enforced by any covenantor against another, regardless of direct harm. So H doesn't seem right.

Option I argues the prohibition doesn't apply because the son didn't buy the lot. But the son did take the lot through the deed, which was subject to the Declaration. So I think I is incorrect.

Putting it all together, the best argument seems to be option G: the psychologist didn't explicitly forbid the sale of alcohol in the son's deed. The son's deed only mentions residential use, and the Declaration's restrictions weren't included. But wait, the Declaration was part of the original conveyance, so the son's deed would still be subject to it unless it's excluded. But in the son's deed, it just says "residential purposes only," which is broader than the specific alcohol restriction. So maybe the son's deed didn't incorporate the Declaration, but the Declaration was still part of the chain of title because the father's deed included it. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the best argument is that the Declaration's restrictions are enforceable, so the son's business violates it. But the options given are the possible arguments for the son. So which is the best? Let me think again.

The son's deed doesn't reference the Declaration, but the original conveyance did. So under property law, the son would still be bound by the Declaration because it's part of the chain of title and he had constructive notice. So options A and F are out because they rely on lack of notice. Option G says the psychologist didn't explicitly forbid it in the son's deed, but the Declaration was part of the original deed, so the son is still subject to those restrictions. So maybe G isn't the best argument.

Wait, the son's deed says "as long as they are used for residential purposes only." So if the son is using the property for a business, that violates his deed's condition. But the Declaration also has the alcohol restriction. So the geologist could argue both. But the son's business might not involve manufacturing or selling on the premises, just selling imported wine from home. So maybe B is a better argument. The business isn't a saloon or a place for manufacturing, just retail. So the restriction doesn't apply.

Alternatively, the Declaration prohibits any structure used as a saloon or place for sale. So selling wine from home might still be a place for sale, depending on the court's interpretation. So B might not hold up. 

Another angle: the Declaration was recorded, so the son is bound by it. So even if the son's deed didn't mention it, he's still subject to the restrictions. Therefore, the best argument for the son would be that the Declaration doesn't apply because it wasn't included in his deed, but that's not entirely correct because the Declaration is still part of the property's history. 

Wait, maybe the issue is whether the Declaration's restrictions run with the land. Since the Declaration was recorded, it should bind the son. So the son's only argument would be that the business doesn't violate the restriction, which is option B. Alternatively, that the geologist doesn't have the right to sue, but that's not the case because any covenantor can enforce the restrictions.

So after considering all options, the best argument for the son is probably option B: his business doesn't qualify as a saloon or place for manufacturing. The fact that he's selling imported wine might not be considered a saloon or a manufacturing place, so the restriction doesn't apply. Alternatively, if the court interprets home sales as a place of sale, then B wouldn't hold. But as a possible argument, B is the best.

The best argument for the son is that his home business selling imported wine does not qualify as a saloon or a place for the manufacture of liquor, as the restriction in the Declaration of Covenants specifically prohibits such uses. 

Answer: B
