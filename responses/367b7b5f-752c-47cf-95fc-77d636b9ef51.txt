Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about theories that support the belief that aggression is necessary. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, the question asks which theories back the idea that aggression is necessary. The options are A to G, each with two theories. I need to figure out which pair is correct.

Let me start by recalling what each theory is about. I remember that aggression has been studied from various angles in psychology and biology. Some theories suggest that aggression is an innate or natural behavior, while others might see it as learned or a response to certain conditions.

Looking at the options:

Option A: "Aggressive Energy" theory and "Natural Born Killer" theory. Hmm, I'm not too familiar with "Aggressive Energy." Maybe it's related to how people channel their energy into aggressive actions. "Natural Born Killer" sounds like it's suggesting humans are born with a tendency to kill, which would support the idea that aggression is inherent.

Option B: "Game" theory and "Cognitive Neoassociation" theory. Game theory is more about strategic decision-making, not directly about aggression. Cognitive Neoassociation might relate to how thoughts and emotions connect, but I'm not sure how that ties into aggression being necessary.

Option C: "Psychoanalytic" theory and "Drive" theory. Psychoanalytic, like Freud's ideas, might discuss instinctual drives, including aggressive ones. The "Drive" theory, perhaps something like the idea that people have a drive for aggression, could support that. So this pair might be relevant.

Option D: "Dominance" theory and "Behaviorist" theory. Dominance is about asserting control, which could tie into aggression. Behaviorist theory deals with learned behaviors, but I'm not sure if it inherently supports that aggression is necessary, more about how it's learned through conditioning.

Option E: "Evolution" theory and "Conflict" theory. Evolutionary theory might suggest that aggression has survival benefits, so that makes sense. Conflict theory is about the struggle between opposing forces, which could involve aggression as a necessary part of resolving conflicts. So this pair seems plausible.

Option F: "Social Learning" theory and "Biological" theory. Social learning is about imitating others, which could explain how aggression is learned, but not necessarily that it's necessary. Biological theory might suggest that aggression is rooted in our biology, but I'm not sure if that's the same as being necessary.

Option G: "Survival of the fittest" theory and "Catharsis" theory. Survival of the fittest is part of evolution, implying that aggression aids in survival. Catharsis theory suggests that expressing aggression can relieve tension, making it necessary in that context.

Now, I need to think which theories explicitly support the necessity of aggression. Evolutionary theory (E) definitely supports the idea that aggression can be adaptive, aiding survival and reproduction. Conflict theory, on the other hand, is more about the existence of conflicting interests leading to behavior, including aggression, but does it say it's necessary? Maybe not as directly as dominance or survival theories.

Option G's "Survival of the fittest" is part of evolution, so that makes sense. Catharsis theory is about releasing aggression, which implies that it's necessary or healthy to express it. So G could be a contender.

Wait, let's go back. The question is about theories that support the belief that aggression is necessary. So which theories present aggression as a necessary part of being human or for survival?

Option E's Evolution theory does support that aggression can be necessary for survival and reproductive success. Conflict theory, though, is more about the occurrence of conflict rather than the necessity of aggression itself.

Option G: Survival of the fittest is a subset of evolution. Catharsis theory says that expressing aggression reduces inner tension, suggesting it's necessary to release it. So G's two theories both support that aggression is necessary.

Option C's Drive theory, from what I remember, is part of the psychoanalytic approach where people have an aggressive drive that needs expression. So that would support the necessity of aggression.

Wait, but in the options, C is "Psychoanalytic" and "Drive" theory. Drive theory, like in psychology, suggests that people have inherent drives, including aggressive ones, which need to be acted upon. So that would support the idea that aggression is necessary.

So now I'm a bit confused. Let's list the options again:

A: Aggressive Energy and Natural Born Killer
B: Game and Cognitive Neoassociation
C: Psychoanalytic and Drive
D: Dominance and Behaviorist
E: Evolution and Conflict
F: Social Learning and Biological
G: Survival of the fittest and Catharsis

I think the correct answer includes theories that directly tie into the necessity of aggression. Evolution (E) is one, and maybe Conflict theory? Or perhaps Dominance theory, which suggests that aggression is a way to establish hierarchy, making it necessary for social structures.

Alternatively, Drive theory (C) and Psychoanalytic (which includes the idea of the id and aggressive instincts) would support that aggression is a necessary drive.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think about each option's theories.

Option C: Psychoanalytic theory (Freudian) suggests that people have unconscious drives, including aggressive ones (the death drive). Drive theory is about internal pressures that motivate behavior. So both would support that aggression is a necessary part of human behavior.

Option E: Evolution theory explains that traits, including aggression, can be advantageous for survival. Conflict theory, though, is more about the existence of opposing forces leading to conflict, not necessarily that aggression is needed.

Option G: Survival of the fittest is part of evolution, so that's about natural selection favoring aggressive traits. Catharsis theory says that expressing aggression is healthy, so it's necessary to release it.

So, which pair is correct? The question is about theories that support the belief that aggression is necessary.

Option E includes Evolution, which supports the idea that aggression is necessary for survival. Conflict theory is more about the presence of conflict, not the necessity of aggression.

Option G includes Catharsis, which suggests that aggression is necessary to relieve tension. Survival of the fittest also supports that aggression is necessary for survival.

Option C includes Drive theory, which says aggression is a basic drive that must be expressed, making it necessary.

So now I'm considering options C, E, and G as possibilities.

Wait, the question is asking for theories which support the belief that aggression is necessary. So which theories actually argue that aggression is a necessary part of human nature or behavior.

- Drive theory (C) says that people have a drive for aggression, so it's necessary.
- Evolution (E) supports that aggression can be adaptive and necessary for survival.
- Catharsis (G) suggests that expressing aggression is necessary for mental health.
- Dominance theory (D) says that aggression is used to establish hierarchy, which could imply it's necessary for social structure.

So the options are E, C, G, and maybe D.

Looking back at the options, the answer is one of the given letters. I think the correct answer is E: Evolution and Conflict theory. Because evolutionary theory supports that aggression is necessary for survival, and conflict theory might explain why aggression arises as a necessary response to conflicts.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe option G is correct because both theories directly tie into the necessity: survival of the fittest as part of evolution, and catharsis as a need to release aggression.

Alternatively, option E includes Evolution, which is definitely about the necessity, and Conflict theory, which is more about the existence of conflict, not necessarily the necessity of aggression.

I'm a bit stuck. Let me think of each theory's main idea.

- Evolutionary theory: Aggression can be an adaptive trait that increases fitness.
- Conflict theory: Focuses on inherent conflicts between individuals or groups, leading to aggressive behaviors, but not necessarily that aggression is necessary.

So option E might not be the best fit because Conflict theory doesn't directly state that aggression is necessary, just that conflict exists.

Option G's Catharsis theory does state that expressing aggression is necessary for mental health. Survival of the fittest is part of evolution, which supports that aggression is necessary for survival.

So perhaps option G is the right choice.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another angle: the question is about theories that support the belief that aggression is necessary. So which theories argue that aggression is a natural, necessary part of human behavior.

Drive theory (C) and Psychoanalytic (C) do that. So option C could be correct.

Alternatively, the "Survival of the fittest" is part of evolution, so option G includes that.

I think the best fit is option E: Evolution and Conflict theory. But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, another approach: looking up the theories.

"Drive theory" suggests that humans have an internal drive to reduce tension, which could include aggressive behavior. So if the drive isn't satisfied, aggression might be necessary.

"Evolution theory" supports that aggression can be advantageous, hence necessary for survival.

"Catharsis theory" says that expressing aggression reduces inner tension, making it necessary for mental health.

"Conflict theory" is more about the existence of conflicting interests, not necessarily the necessity of aggression.

So, the theories that directly support that aggression is necessary are:

- Evolution (survival)
- Drive (internal necessity)
- Catharsis (health necessity)
- Dominance (social necessity)

Looking at the options, E is Evolution and Conflict, G is Survival (evolution) and Catharsis.

So option G includes two theories that support the necessity of aggression: survival for fitness and catharsis for mental health.

Therefore, the correct answer is G.
</think>

The question asks which theories support the belief that aggression is necessary. To determine the correct answer, each option was analyzed based on whether the theories explicitly or implicitly argue for the necessity of aggression.

- **Option A**: "Aggressive Energy" and "Natural Born Killer" theories suggest aggression is inherent but do not explicitly tie to its necessity.
- **Option B**: "Game" and "Cognitive Neoassociation" theories do not directly address the necessity of aggression.
- **Option C**: "Psychoanalytic" and "Drive" theories suggest aggression is a natural drive, supporting its necessity.
- **Option D**: "Dominance" theory implies aggression is necessary for social hierarchy, but "Behaviorist" theory focuses on learned behaviors.
- **Option E**: "Evolution" theory supports aggression as adaptive for survival, while "Conflict" theory focuses on the existence of conflict rather than the necessity of aggression.
- **Option F**: "Social Learning" and "Biological" theories explain how aggression is learned or biologically rooted but do not emphasize its necessity.
- **Option G**: "Survival of the fittest" (part of evolution) supports aggression as necessary for survival, and "Catharsis" theory suggests aggression is necessary for relieving tension.

After careful consideration, **Option G** is the best fit because both theories directly tie into the necessity of aggression: survival for fitness and catharsis for mental health.

**Answer: G**
