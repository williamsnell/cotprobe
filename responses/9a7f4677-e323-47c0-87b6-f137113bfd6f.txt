Okay, so I have this question about the 8086/8088 microprocessor, and I'm trying to figure out where the wait states are inserted in the bus cycle. I remember that the bus cycle is divided into four clock periods: T1, T2, T3, and T4. But wait, the question adds that there are wait states, Tw, which are inserted between some of these phases. 

Wait, wait. I think the bus cycle is usually four states, but sometimes there are wait states added. I'm trying to recall how the bus cycle works. So, the 8086/8088 uses a bus cycle for memory and I/O operations. Each cycle has four phases: T1 is the address setup, T2 is the address hold, T3 is the data setup, and T4 is the data hold. 

But wait, sometimes the system might need more time, so it adds wait states. Wait, where are these wait states inserted? Oh right, I think they come after the T3 phase. Because after the address is set up, the processor might need to wait for the memory to respond. So, the wait states are between T3 and T4. Or is it after T2? Hmm, no, wait. Let me think again.

In the bus cycle, T1 is when the address is put on the address bus. T2 is the address hold, giving time for the memory or I/O to accept the address. Then T3 is when the data is set up, and T4 is the data hold. So, if there's a need for wait states, they would come after T3 before T4. Because sometimes the memory might not be ready to send data immediately after the address is set up. So the processor would insert Tw between T3 and T4. 

So the wait states are inserted between T3 and T4. Looking at the options, option C is T3 & T4. That must be the correct answer. I think I'm confident with that.

The wait states in the 8086/8088 bus cycle are inserted between T3 and T4 to allow additional time for memory or I/O to respond.
