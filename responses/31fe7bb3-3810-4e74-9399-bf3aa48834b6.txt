Okay, so I've got this problem here where Jack gets a 5% commission on all his sales. His sales for the week are $1,200, and I need to figure out how much commission he earns. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that a commission is a percentage of the total sales. So, if Jack's commission rate is 5%, that means he gets 5% of whatever he sells. In this case, his sales are $1,200.

I think the way to calculate this is to convert the percentage into a decimal. So, 5% as a decimal is 0.05. Then, I multiply that by the total sales amount. So, the formula would be:

Commission = (Commission Rate) × (Sales)

Plugging in the numbers, that would be:

Commission = 0.05 × 1200

Let me do that multiplication. 0.05 times 1200. Hmm, 0.05 is like 5 cents, and if I have 5 cents times 1200, that's like 5 times 1200 divided by 100. Wait, no, that's not right. Actually, 0.05 is the same as 5/100, so multiplying 1200 by 5/100 would be the same as (1200 × 5) ÷ 100.

Calculating that, 1200 × 5 is 6000. Then, dividing by 100 gives me 60. So, the commission is $60.

Wait, let me double-check that because sometimes I mix up the decimal places. Another way to think about it is moving the decimal point two places to the left when converting a percentage to a decimal, so 5% becomes 0.05. Then, 0.05 times 1200. Let me compute that again.

0.05 × 1200:
- 0.05 × 1000 = 50
- 0.05 × 200 = 10
Adding those together, 50 + 10 = 60. Yep, that checks out.

So, looking at the options provided, the correct answer should be $60, which is option J.

The commission is calculated by multiplying 5% (or 0.05) by $1,200, resulting in $60.

Answer: J
