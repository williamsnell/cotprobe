Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to compute the gradient of a function in cylindrical coordinates. The function is given as f(x, y, z) = z / (x² + y²). Hmm, I remember that in cylindrical coordinates, we use ρ, θ, and z, where ρ is the radial distance from the z-axis, θ is the angle around the z-axis, and z is the same as the Cartesian z-coordinate. 

First, I should probably express the function f in terms of cylindrical coordinates. Because x² + y² is equal to ρ², right? So f(x,y,z) becomes z / ρ². That's simpler.

Now, I need to find the gradient of f in cylindrical coordinates. The gradient in cylindrical coordinates (ρ, θ, z) is given by a vector with three components: the partial derivative with respect to ρ, the partial derivative with respect to θ, and the partial derivative with respect to z. Each of these is multiplied by the corresponding unit vectors u_ρ, u_θ, and u_z.

Wait, no, I think I might be mixing something up. Let me recall the formula for the gradient in cylindrical coordinates. The gradient of a scalar function f is:

∇f = (∂f/∂ρ) u_ρ + (1/ρ)(∂f/∂θ) u_θ + (∂f/∂z) u_z.

So I need to compute each of these partial derivatives.

First, let's compute ∂f/∂ρ. Since f = z / ρ², the derivative with respect to ρ is straightforward. Using the power rule, the derivative of ρ² is 2ρ, so:

∂f/∂ρ = (0 * ρ² - z * 2ρ) / (ρ²)^2 = (-2z ρ) / ρ^4 = -2z / ρ³.

Wait, let me double-check that. f is z times ρ^(-2). So the derivative is z * (-2) * ρ^(-3) * ∂ρ/∂ρ = -2z ρ^(-3) = -2z / ρ³. Yeah, that's correct.

Next, the partial derivative with respect to θ, ∂f/∂θ. Since f is z / ρ² and ρ is sqrt(x² + y²), which doesn't depend on θ, the partial derivative of f with respect to θ should be zero. Wait, no, because in cylindrical coordinates, when you take derivatives with respect to θ, you have to consider how each variable changes. But f doesn't depend on θ at all. So ∂f/∂θ = 0. Therefore, when multiplied by 1/ρ, it's still zero. So the θ-component of the gradient is zero.

Wait, but let me think again. Since f does not depend on θ, any partial derivative with respect to θ will indeed be zero. So that term drops out.

Lastly, the partial derivative with respect to z, ∂f/∂z. Since f = z / ρ², the derivative with respect to z is 1 / ρ².

Putting it all together, the gradient ∇f is:

∇f = (-2z / ρ³) u_ρ + (1/ρ)(0) u_θ + (1 / ρ²) u_z.

Simplifying, this becomes:

∇f = (-2z / ρ³) u_ρ + (1 / ρ²) u_z.

Now, looking at the options, I need to match this expression. Let's look through the options.

Option A: -(2z/ρ²)u_ρ + (1/ρ³)u_z. Hmm, the first term has ρ² in the denominator, but I have ρ³. So that's not matching.

Option B: (z/ρ³)u_ρ + (1/ρ)u_θ - (1/ρ³)u_z. This has a positive z term and also a θ component which isn't present in my result. So no.

Option C: - (2z / ρ^3)u_ρ + (1 / ρ)u_z. Wait, the second term here is 1/ρ, but I have 1/ρ². So this doesn't match.

Option D: - (z / ρ^2)u_ρ + (1 / ρ^3)u_z. Again, the first term's denominator is ρ², should be ρ³. So nope.

Option E: - (1 / ρ²)u_ρ - (2z / ρ³)u_θ + (2 / ρ)u_z. Hmm, that's a mix of terms, but the gradient has only u_ρ and u_z components, so this can't be right.

Option F: (1 / ρ²)u_ρ + (z / ρ³)u_θ + (2 / ρ³)u_z. Also has u_θ and u_z terms, but I don't have any θ component.

Option G: - (2z / ρ³)u_ρ + (1 / ρ²)u_z. Wait, this looks promising. The first term matches what I have: -2z/ρ³ u_ρ. The second term is 1/ρ² u_z, which is exactly what I derived. So this is option G.

Wait, let me check the other options just to be sure.

Option H: (2z/ρ³)u_ρ - (1/ρ)u_θ + (1/ρ²)u_z. The first term has a positive coefficient, but I have negative. So no.

Option I: (2z/ρ³)u_ρ + (1/ρ²)u_z. Again, positive coefficient for the first term, so no.

Option J: (2/ρ³)u_ρ - (z/ρ²)u_θ - (1/ρ)u_z. Again, has θ term and signs don't match.

So the correct option is G.

To compute the gradient of the function \( f(x, y, z) = \frac{z}{x^2 + y^2} \) in cylindrical coordinates \((\rho, \theta, z)\), we first express \( f \) in cylindrical coordinates. Since \( x^2 + y^2 = \rho^2 \), the function becomes \( f(\rho, \theta, z) = \frac{z}{\rho^2} \).

The gradient in cylindrical coordinates is given by:
\[
\nabla f = \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial \rho} \right) \mathbf{u}_\rho + \left( \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta} \right) \mathbf{u}_\theta + \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \right) \mathbf{u}_z.
\]

1. **Compute \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial \rho} \):**
   \[
   \frac{\partial f}{\partial \rho} = \frac{\partial}{\partial \rho} \left( \frac{z}{\rho^2} \right) = -\frac{2z}{\rho^3}.
   \]

2. **Compute \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta} \):**
   Since \( f \) does not depend on \( \theta \), 
   \[
   \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta} = 0.
   \]
   Thus, the \( \mathbf{u}_\theta \) component is zero.

3. **Compute \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \):**
   \[
   \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} = \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \left( \frac{z}{\rho^2} \right) = \frac{1}{\rho^2}.
   \]

Putting it all together, the gradient is:
\[
\nabla f = -\frac{2z}{\rho^3} \mathbf{u}_\rho + \frac{1}{\rho^2} \mathbf{u}_z.
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

G: \( -\frac{2z}{\rho^3} \mathbf{u}_\rho + \frac{1}{\rho^2} \mathbf{u}_z \).
