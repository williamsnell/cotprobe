Okay, so I have this physics problem about a parallel-plate capacitor. I'm a bit rusty on my electrostatics, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question gives me the dimensions: the plates are 20 cm square and 0.5 cm apart. It asks for four things: capacitance, charge when charged to 1000 volts, energy stored, and the force between the plates. There are multiple-choice options from A to J, each providing values for all four parts.

First, I'll tackle part (a), the capacitance. I remember the formula for capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor is C = ε₀ * (A/d), where ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity, A is the area of the plates, and d is the separation between them.

Wait, the units given are in centimeters. I should convert them to meters because the standard unit for these calculations is meters. So, the area A is 20 cm square. Wait, 20 cm square? Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. Wait, no, the plates are 20 cm square each, so each plate is a square with sides 20 cm? Or is it that each plate is 20 cm²? Let me read the question again: "plates 20 cm. square and 0.5 cm. apart." Oh, so each plate is 20 cm² in area. Because 20 cm square is 20 cm x 20 cm, which is 400 cm², but that seems too big. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the area is 20 cm², not 20 cm x something else. Because 20 cm square would be 20 cm x 20 cm, which is 400 cm², but that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's 20 cm² as in the area is 20 cm². Let me think: 1 cm² is 1e-4 m², so 20 cm² is 20e-4 m². Wait, but wait, 20 cm² is 0.002 m², which is 2000 mm². Alternatively, perhaps the plates are 20 cm in length and 20 cm in width, making the area 20 cm x 20 cm = 400 cm², which is 0.04 m². Wait, but the question says "20 cm. square" which probably means each plate is a square of 20 cm on each side. So area A is (0.2 m)^2 = 0.04 m². Wait, 20 cm is 0.2 meters. So area A is (0.2 m) * (0.2 m) = 0.04 m². Or wait, no, 20 cm is 0.2 m, so a square of 20 cm sides would be 0.2 m x 0.2 m = 0.04 m². But wait, the question says "plates 20 cm. square", so perhaps each plate is a square of 20 cm per side, so area is 0.2 m * 0.2 m = 0.04 m². Okay, that makes sense.

Then the separation d is 0.5 cm, which is 0.005 meters.

So now, plugging into the formula C = ε₀ * (A/d). The value of ε₀ is approximately 8.854e-12 farads per meter (F/m).

So C = 8.854e-12 F/m * (0.04 m²) / 0.005 m.

Let me compute that. First, 0.04 / 0.005 is 8. So 8.854e-12 * 8 = 70.832e-12 F, which is 70.832 picofarads (pF). Hmm, looking at the options, option B is 70.8 pF, and option D is 75.8 pF, etc. So part (a) would be approximately 70.8 pF.

So that points to option B, D, or maybe others, but let me check the other parts to see if they align.

Next, part (b) is the charge when charged to a potential difference (p.d.) of 1000 volts. The formula is Q = C * V. So Q = 70.832e-12 F * 1000 V. Let me compute that: 70.832e-12 F * 1e3 V = 70.832e-9 C, which is 7.0832e-8 coulombs. So approximately 7.08e-8 C. Looking at the options, option B says 7.08e-8 C, which matches. Option D has 7.58e-8, which is higher. So this would support option B.

Moving to part (c), the energy stored. The energy U is given by (1/2) * C * V². So U = 0.5 * 70.832e-12 F * (1000 V)^2. Let's compute that: 0.5 * 70.832e-12 * 1e6 = 0.5 * 70.832e-6 = 35.416e-6 J, which is 3.5416e-5 J. So approximately 3.54e-5 J. Option B has 3.54e-5 J, which matches.

Now part (d), the force between the plates. The force F can be calculated using F = (1/2) * C * V² / d. Alternatively, another formula is F = (ε₀ * A * V²) / d. Let me think. Alternatively, F = (C * V²) / (2d). Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check. The force between the plates is given by F = (1/2) * C * V² / d. So using the values we have: C=70.832e-12 F, V=1000 V, d=0.005 m.

So F = (0.5 * 70.832e-12 F * (1000)^2) / 0.005 m.

Calculating step by step: 1000^2 is 1e6. So 0.5 * 70.832e-12 * 1e6 = 0.5 * 70.832e-6 = 35.416e-6. Then divide by 0.005: 35.416e-6 / 0.005 = 7.0832e-3 N. So approximately 7.08e-3 N, which is 7.08 millinewtons. Also, 7.08e-3 N is 708 dynes (since 1 dyne = 1e-5 N). Option B states 7.08e-3 N, which matches.

So all four parts for option B match my calculations. Let me just check if I made any mistakes in the calculations.

Wait, another way to calculate the force is F = (C * V^2) / (2d). Let me try that. C=70.832e-12 F, V=1000 V, so V^2=1e6. So 70.832e-12 * 1e6 = 70.832e-6. Divided by (2 * 0.005) = 0.01. So 70.832e-6 / 0.01 = 7.0832e-3 N. Same result. So that's correct.

Alternatively, another formula for force is F = (ε₀ * A * V^2) / d. Let me compute that way as a check. ε₀=8.854e-12 F/m, A=0.04 m², V=1000 V, d=0.005 m.

So F = (8.854e-12 * 0.04 * 1e6) / 0.005.

Compute numerator: 8.854e-12 * 0.04 = 3.5416e-13. Multiply by 1e6: 3.5416e-7. Divide by 0.005: 3.5416e-7 / 0.005 = 7.0832e-5? Wait, that can't be right because earlier I got 7.08e-3 N. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute step by step:

ε₀ * A = 8.854e-12 F/m * 0.04 m² = 3.5416e-13 F·m.

Then multiply by V²: (3.5416e-13 F·m) * (1e6 V²) = 3.5416e-7 F·V²·m.

Wait, but F·V² is equivalent to (C/V)·V² = C·V, which is energy in joules. So 3.5416e-7 J·m.

Then divide by d: 3.5416e-7 J·m / 0.005 m = 7.0832e-5 J. Wait, but that gives energy, not force. Wait, no, I think I messed up the formula.

Wait, the formula for force is F = (ε₀ * A * V²) / d. So let me compute it correctly.

Compute numerator: ε₀ * A * V² = 8.854e-12 * 0.04 * 1e6.

8.854e-12 * 0.04 = 3.5416e-13.

3.5416e-13 * 1e6 = 3.5416e-7.

Then divide by d=0.005: 3.5416e-7 / 0.005 = 7.0832e-5? Wait, that's 7.0832e-5 N, which is 7.0832e-5 N, which is 0.000070832 N. But earlier I got 7.0832e-3 N. That's a discrepancy. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me check another source. Oh wait, the correct formula for the force between the plates of a capacitor is F = (1/2) * C * V² / d. Alternatively, F = (C * V²) / (2d). Wait, but when I used that formula earlier, I got 7.08e-3 N, which matches option B. But when I tried using ε₀ * A * V² / d, I got a different answer. That suggests I made a mistake in that approach.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula. The force between the plates can also be calculated using F = (1/2) * (ε₀ * E² * A), where E is the electric field. E is V/d, so E = 1000 V / 0.005 m = 2e5 V/m. Then E² = (2e5)^2 = 4e10 V²/m².

So F = 0.5 * ε₀ * E² * A = 0.5 * 8.854e-12 F/m * 4e10 V²/m² * 0.04 m².

Compute step by step:

0.5 * 8.854e-12 = 4.427e-12.

4.427e-12 * 4e10 = 4.427e-12 * 4e10 = (4.427 * 4) * 1e-2 = 17.708 * 0.01 = 0.17708.

Then multiply by A = 0.04 m²: 0.17708 * 0.04 = 0.0070832 N, which is 7.0832e-3 N. That matches the earlier result. So I must have made a mistake in the earlier calculation using ε₀ * A * V² / d. Let me see where I went wrong.

Ah, I see now. The correct formula is F = (ε₀ * A * V²) / (2d). Because when I used the first method, I got 7.08e-3 N, which is the correct value. So perhaps I forgot to include the 1/2 factor in that approach.

So, to avoid confusion, the correct force is indeed 7.08e-3 N, which is 708 dynes. So option B's part (d) has 7.08e-3 N, which is correct.

So all four parts (a) through (d) for option B match my calculations. Therefore, the correct answer should be option B.

The problem involves calculating four properties of a parallel-plate capacitor: capacitance, charge, energy stored, and the force between the plates. The given dimensions are plates of 20 cm² area separated by 0.5 cm. The calculations proceed as follows:

1. **Capacitance (C):**  
   Using the formula \( C = \varepsilon_0 \frac{A}{d} \), where \( \varepsilon_0 = 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F/m} \), \( A = 0.04 \, \text{m}^2 \), and \( d = 0.005 \, \text{m} \):  
   \[
   C = 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \times \frac{0.04}{0.005} = 70.832 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F} = 70.8 \, \text{pF}.
   \]

2. **Charge (Q):**  
   Using \( Q = C \cdot V \), where \( V = 1000 \, \text{V} \):  
   \[
   Q = 70.832 \times 10^{-12} \times 1000 = 7.0832 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{C}.
   \]

3. **Energy Stored (U):**  
   Using \( U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \):  
   \[
   U = 0.5 \times 70.832 \times 10^{-12} \times 10^6 = 3.5416 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{J}.
   \]

4. **Force (F):**  
   Using \( F = \frac{1}{2} \frac{C V^2}{d} \):  
   \[
   F = \frac{0.5 \times 70.832 \times 10^{-12} \times 10^6}{0.005} = 7.0832 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{N}.
   \]

All calculated values match the data in option B, confirming it as the correct choice.
