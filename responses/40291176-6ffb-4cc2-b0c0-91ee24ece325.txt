B: 30
C: 120
D: 10
E: 8
F: 7

Okay, so I've got this question here about searching a sorted list of integers. The list has 120 elements, and I need to figure out the maximum number of elements that must be examined to determine if the value 100 is present. The options are from A to J, with numbers ranging from 6 to 120.

Hmm, the question says the most efficient searching algorithm is used. Well, if the list is sorted, the most efficient method is binary search, right? Because binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), which is better than linear search's O(n).

Wait, let me think about how binary search works. It starts by comparing the target value to the middle element of the list. If the target is equal, it's found. If it's less, the search continues in the left half; if it's more, the search continues in the right half. This process repeats until the target is found or the list is exhausted.

So, the maximum number of elements examined would be the worst-case scenario for binary search. That's when the target is either at the end of the list or not present at all. The number of steps required is the number of times you can divide the list in half until you're left with one element.

The formula for the maximum number of comparisons in a binary search is the ceiling of log2(n), where n is the number of elements. Let me calculate that. Log base 2 of 120.

I know that 2^6 is 64 and 2^7 is 128. Since 120 is between 64 and 128, log2(120) is approximately 6.906. The ceiling of that is 7, which means the maximum number of elements checked is 7.

Wait, but wait. Does each step in binary search count as examining an element? Because in each step, you check the middle element. So if the list is size 120, the first step checks the middle, which is the 60th element. Then, depending on where you go, you check another middle in the next half, and so on.

So each step reduces the problem size by half, and each step involves checking one element. So for 120 elements, how many steps? Let me count:

Step 1: 120 elements → check middle (60th). If 100 is not there, decide to go left or right.

Wait, but wait, if the list is sorted, and we're looking for 100, depending on the arrangement, maybe the maximum steps would be when the list is such that 100 is at the end, or not present, and the binary search takes the maximum steps.

Alternatively, another way to think about it: the maximum number of elements checked in binary search is the number of times you can divide 120 by 2 until you get to 1. Let's see:

120 → 60 → 30 → 15 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1. That's 7 steps. So each step involves checking one element. So the maximum number of elements examined is 7.

Looking at the options, F is 7. So the answer should be F.

The question involves searching a sorted list of 120 integers for the value 100 using the most efficient algorithm, which is binary search. Binary search examines the middle element in each step, reducing the search space by half each time. The maximum number of elements examined corresponds to the worst-case scenario, which is the ceiling of log2(120). Calculating this, log2(120) ≈ 6.906, so the ceiling is 7. Each step in binary search involves checking one element, leading to a maximum of 7 elements examined.

Answer: F
