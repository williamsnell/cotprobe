Okay, so I've got this question about Erikson's stages of psychosocial development. I'm a bit rusty on my psychology, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking which challenge, according to Erikson, someone would regret not resolving at the end of their life. The key here is the feeling that their life lacked fulfillment. So, I'm thinking about the stages and their corresponding crises.

Erikson developed eight stages, each with a specific crisis or challenge. The stages are typically divided into two parts: the first five are more about individual development, and the last three focus more on relationships and society.

Let me list out the stages and their crises:

1. Trust vs. Mistrust (Infancy)
2. Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt (Toddlerhood)
3. Initiative vs. Guilt (Preschool)
4. Industry vs. Inferiority (School Age)
5. Identity vs. Role Confusion (Adolescence)
6. Intimacy vs. Isolation (Young Adulthood)
7. Generativity vs. Stagnation (Middle Adulthood)
8. Integrity vs. Despair (Late Adulthood)

The question is about looking back with regrets and a sense that life lacked fulfillment. That sounds like it's related to the later stages, probably the last one because it's about old age reflecting on life. So, the eighth stage is Integrity vs. Despair. If someone hasn't resolved this, they might feel that their life wasn't as fulfilling, leading to regret.

Wait, but I should double-check the other options. Option D is Integrity vs. Despair, which seems to fit. Other options like Intimacy vs. Isolation (B or I) are about forming close relationships, which is in young adulthood. If someone didn't form intimate relationships, they might feel isolated, but the question is more about overall fulfillment in life.

Generativity vs. Stagnation (F) is about contributing to society, like being a parent or mentoring. If someone didn't do that, they might feel stagnant, but again, that's middle adulthood. The question seems to be about the end of life, so it's more about the eighth stage.

Ego identity vs. role confusion (C or E) is about finding oneself in adolescence. Not resolving that would cause confusion, but again, the question is about looking back at the end of life, so that's not it.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be D: integrity versus despair.

The question pertains to Erikson's theory of psychosocial development, focusing on the stage that reflects on the end of life with regret and a sense of unfulfilled life. Erikson's stages are divided into eight, with the last stage being Integrity vs. Despair, which occurs in late adulthood. This stage involves reflecting on one's life and feeling either a sense of fulfillment (integrity) or regret and despair. Therefore, the correct answer is D: integrity versus despair.

Answer: D
