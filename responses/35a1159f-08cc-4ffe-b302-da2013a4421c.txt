Okay, so I have this question about the age for receiving full Social Security benefits. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me start by recalling what I know about Social Security in the US.

I remember that Social Security has different ages related to when people can start receiving benefits. There's the full retirement age and the earliest age you can start, which I think is 62. But the question is about the full benefits, so I'm guessing it's the full retirement age.

I think the full retirement age used to be 65, but I've heard that it's changed over time. Maybe it's higher now. I remember something about it being 67, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about when that change happened. I think it was part of the Social Security Amendments in the 1980s, maybe the 1983 amendments. That was under President Reagan, I believe. So the full retirement age started increasing then, right? 

So before 1983, the full retirement age was 65, and it gradually increased. Now, for people born after 1959, the full retirement age is 67. Wait, no, actually, it's a bit more nuanced. The exact age depends on the year you were born. For example, someone born in 1960 or later would have a full retirement age of 67. But for someone born in the 1940s or early 1950s, it might have been 65 or 66.

So the question is asking about the current age for full benefits. From what I understand, it's 67 for most people now. So looking at the options, option I is 67, which would be the correct answer. 

Let me check the other options to be sure. Option C is 65, which was the case before the changes. Option F is 62, which is the earliest age you can start, but that's not full benefits. Option H says it's the same as retirement age, which I think is correct because retirement age refers to the full benefit age. But the question is specifically asking the age, so the answer would be the number, not a description. So the correct answer is I: 67.

I don't think it's D, which says it's been increasing, because the question is about the current age, not the trend. Similarly, A says it's decreasing, which isn't correct. E says it will never change, but I know that adjustments have been made and could be in the future. J is 72, which is way too high. G says it's decided by the individual, but no, it's set by law. So yeah, I'm confident that the answer is I: 67.

The age at which one can receive full benefits from Social Security is 67, as it has been adjusted over time, especially with changes in the 1980s.
