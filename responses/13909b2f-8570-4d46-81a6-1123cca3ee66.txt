Okay, so I have this economics question about what happens when the aggregate demand curve shifts to the right, assuming a Classical aggregate supply curve. Hmm, I need to figure out the effects on the equilibrium price level and quantity of output.

Let me start by recalling what I know about aggregate demand and supply. The aggregate demand curve represents the total demand for goods and services in an economy at different price levels. A rightward shift of this curve means that at every price level, the quantity of output demanded increases. So, the economy is willing to buy more at each price point.

The aggregate supply curve, in the Classical model, is vertical. That's because in the long run, the economy's output is determined by its productive capacity, which isn't affected by the price level. So, a vertical supply curve means that the equilibrium quantity of output is fixed, and any changes in demand only affect the price level.

Wait, so if aggregate demand shifts right, the economy moves along the supply curve. Since the supply curve is vertical, the equilibrium quantity doesn't change. But the price level must adjust. If AD increases, at the same quantity, the price level would rise because there's more demand for the same amount of output.

So putting that together, the equilibrium quantity remains the same, but the price level increases. Let me look at the options.

Option A says both remain unchanged. No, because the price level changes.

Option B: Price increases, quantity same. That sounds right.

Option C: Price decreases, quantity increases. No, that's more like a Keynesian AS where higher demand leads to higher Q and P.

Option J: Both increase. But with a vertical AS curve, Q can't increase; it's fixed.

So the correct answer should be B: equilibrium price level increases while quantity remains unchanged.

When the aggregate demand curve shifts to the right under a Classical aggregate supply framework, the equilibrium quantity of output remains unchanged because the supply curve is vertical. However, the equilibrium price level increases due to the higher demand at the same output level.

Answer: B
