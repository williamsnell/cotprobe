Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about sampling methods that an auditor would use to estimate a numerical measurement of a population, like the dollar value of inventory. The options are A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I should understand what each sampling method is used for. The question is specifically about estimating a numerical value, so it's about variables, not attributes. That already helps narrow it down.

Let me go through each option:

A: Variable sampling. I remember that variable sampling is used when the auditor wants to estimate a numerical value, like the total dollar amount. This seems relevant because the question is about estimating inventory value. So this could be the answer.

B: Discovery sampling. I think this is used to identify instances of something, maybe errors or fraud. It's more about finding specific items rather than measuring a total. So probably not this one.

C: Snowball sampling. That's a nonprobability method where you select a few initial subjects and then let them recommend others. Not sure how this applies to auditing, seems more like a qualitative method, not for numerical measurements.

D: Stratified sampling. This involves dividing the population into subgroups (strata) and sampling from each. It can be useful for improving precision, but the question is about the method to use, not necessarily the most efficient. So while it's a good method, it's not the only one applicable here.

E: Systematic sampling. Here, you select every nth item from a list. It's straightforward but might not always be the best for ensuring representativeness. Still, it's a method an auditor might use, but I'm not sure if it's the primary one for estimating a numerical value.

F: Attribute sampling. This is used when the auditor is testing for the presence of a characteristic, like whether invoices have been approved. It's about pass/fail or yes/no, not numerical values, so probably not F.

G: Random-number sampling. This is a type of probability sampling where each member has an equal chance of being selected. It's similar to simple random sampling and is good for ensuring representativeness. It's used for estimating variables, so this could be another contender.

H: Quota sampling. This is a nonprobability method where you select individuals to meet certain quotas, like specific demographics. Not relevant for numerical estimation in auditing.

I: Cluster sampling. This involves dividing the population into clusters and sampling from each. It's efficient for large populations but might not be the best for precise numerical estimates, especially in auditing where precision is key.

J: Convenience sampling. This is just selecting whoever is easiest to reach. Not suitable for accurate estimation.

So narrowing it down, the methods that deal with numerical measurements are Variable sampling (A), Random-number sampling (G), and maybe Stratified sampling (D) or Systematic sampling (E). But the question is about which method would an auditor use to estimate a numerical measurement. Variable sampling is specifically designed for this purpose, so A seems correct.

Wait, but I thought variable sampling is a type of sampling method used in this context. Alternatively, random-number sampling is a technique within variable sampling. So perhaps variable sampling is the correct category, while random-number is a method within it. So the answer should be A: Variable sampling.

The correct answer is A: Variable sampling. This method is specifically used to estimate numerical measurements, such as the dollar value of inventory. 

Answer: A
