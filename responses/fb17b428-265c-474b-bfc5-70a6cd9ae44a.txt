Okay, so I've got this question about two's-complement numbers and overflow when adding pairs of 8-bit numbers. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that in two's-complement, the most significant bit (MSB) is the sign bit. So if the MSB is 0, the number is positive, and if it's 1, the number is negative. Overflow occurs when the result of an addition exceeds the range representable by the number of bits, which for 8-bit numbers is from -128 to 127.

The question asks which pair will cause an overflow when added. So I need to check each option to see if adding the two numbers in the pair would result in a value outside this range.

Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: 11110000 and 00001111.
- 11110000 is negative. Let's find its decimal value. In two's complement, to get the positive equivalent, invert and add 1. Inverting gives 00001111, add 1 to get 1000, which is 16 in decimal. So since the original was negative, it's -16.
- 00001111 is positive. That's 15 in decimal.
- Adding them: -16 + 15 = -1. That's within -128 to 127, so no overflow. So A is not the answer.

Option B: 01111111 and 10000000.
- 01111111 is positive. Let's convert: 127 (since 127 is 01111111 in binary).
- 10000000 is negative. Inverting and adding 1: 01111111 +1 = 10000000, which is -128.
- Adding them: 127 + (-128) = -1. Again, within range, so no overflow. So B is not the answer.

Option C: 00000001 and 10000000.
- 00000001 is +1.
- 10000000 is -128.
- Adding them: 1 + (-128) = -127. Still within the range, so no overflow. So C is out.

Option D: 10000001 and 10101010.
- 10000001: Let's find its value. Inverting gives 01111110, add 1: 01111111, which is 127. So the original is -127 +1? Wait, no. Wait, two's complement: for 10000001, invert to 01111110, add 1: 01111111 (127), so the value is -128 + (127 +1) ? Wait, no, wait: wait, the formula is that the value is -(2^(n) - (positive equivalent)). So 10000001 is -127? Wait, let me think again. Wait, 10000001 inverts to 01111110, add 1: 01111111 (127). So since the original was negative, it's -127? Or is it -128 + (127 +1)? Wait, no, I think the correct way is that the two's complement of a number is equal to the negative of its positive counterpart. So 10000001 is -127 because 127 is 01111111, so -127 is 10000001.

Wait, no, wait: 10000000 is -128. So 10000001 is -127, correct. Because each increment of the number from 10000000 adds 1, so 10000001 is -127, 10000010 is -126, etc.

So 10000001 is -127.

Next, 10101010: Let's convert. Invert to 01010101 (which is 85), add 1: 86. So the value is -86.

Now, adding -127 and -86: -127 -86 = -213. Wait, but the 8-bit range is only down to -128, so -213 is way below that. So this would cause an overflow. Because when adding two negative numbers, their sum is more negative than the minimum representable, so it overflows.

Wait, but wait: 8-bit two's complement can represent down to -128. So if the sum is less than -128, that's an overflow. So in this case, -127 + (-86) = -213, which is less than -128, so yes, overflow occurs. So D is a possible candidate.

But let me check the other options to be sure.

Option E: 11111111 and 00000001.
- 11111111 is the maximum negative number, which is -1. Because inverting gives 00000000, add 1: 00000001, so -1.
- 00000001 is +1.
- Adding them: -1 +1 = 0. That's within the range, so no overflow. So E is out.

Option F: 11111111 and 10000001.
- 11111111 is -1.
- 10000001 is -127.
- Adding them: -1 + (-127) = -128. Wait, -128 is exactly the minimum representable value, right? So does that cause overflow?

Hmm, in two's complement, when you add numbers and the result is exactly the minimum value, does that count as overflow? Because the sum is within the representable range, so no overflow. So F would not cause overflow.

Wait, but wait: when adding two negative numbers, if their sum is exactly -128, that's okay, no overflow. So F is not the answer.

Option G: 00000000 and 10000000.
- 00000000 is 0.
- 10000000 is -128.
- Adding them: 0 + (-128) = -128, which is within the range. So no overflow. So G is out.

Option H: 10000001 and 00000001.
- 10000001 is -127.
- 00000001 is +1.
- Adding them: -127 +1 = -126, which is within range. So H is out.

Option I: 10101010 and 11111111.
- 10101010 is -86, as calculated earlier.
- 11111111 is -1.
- Adding them: -86 + (-1) = -87. That's within the range, so no overflow. So I is out.

So the only pair that causes overflow is D: 10000001 and 10101010, which add up to -213, which is outside the 8-bit two's complement range of -128 to 127.

The correct answer is D.

The pair 10000001 and 10101010 adds to a value outside the 8-bit two's-complement range, causing overflow.

Answer: D
