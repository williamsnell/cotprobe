Question:

A 43-year-old female presents to the office with a 2-month history of heat intolerance, weight loss, tachycardia, and diffuse goiter. Examination reveals exophthalmos, inflammation of the periorbital tissue and conjunctivae, a heart rate of 140/min, and warm, velvety skin. An MRI of the head and orbits will most likely reveal

C: normal brain tissue
D: calcification of the orbit
E: diffuse enlargement of the rectus muscles
F: pituitary adenoma
G: dilated ventricles
H: cerebral aneurysm
I: inflammation of the optic nerve
J: brain metastases

Okay, let me try to work through this question step by step. So, the patient is a 43-year-old woman with a 2-month history of symptoms. Her main complaints are heat intolerance, weight loss, tachycardia, and diffuse goiter. On examination, she has exophthalmos, inflammation of the periorbital tissue and conjunctivae, a heart rate of 140/min, and warm, velvety skin.

Hmm, let me start by thinking about the symptoms. Heat intolerance and weight loss could be related to hyperthyroidism. Tachycardia is a common sign of increased heart rate, which makes sense with hyperthyroidism because thyroid hormones increase metabolic rate and heart rate. The goiter suggests an enlarged thyroid, which is typical in hyperthyroidism, especially in conditions like Graves' disease.

Exophthalmos is another key symptom. I remember that exophthalmos is often associated with Graves' ophthalmopathy, which is an autoimmune condition where the eyes are affected. The inflammation of the periorbital tissue and conjunctivae also points towards an orbital issue, likely related to the eye muscles or surrounding tissues.

The skin being warm and velvety also fits with hyperthyroidism because the increased metabolic rate can make the skin feel warm and smooth. So putting this all together, it seems like the patient might have Graves' disease, which is an autoimmune condition causing hyperthyroidism.

Now, the question is about what an MRI of the head and orbits would show. The options are A through J. Let's go through them.

A: lymphoma – I don't see any direct link here. The symptoms don't suggest a cancerous process, more like an endocrine disorder.

B: atrophy of the optic nerve – Optic atrophy would cause vision loss, but the main issue here is exophthalmos and inflammation, not optic nerve atrophy.

C: normal brain tissue – Maybe, but the symptoms are more about orbit and thyroid, so perhaps the brain looks normal.

D: calcification of the orbit – I'm not sure, but calcifications are more common in chronic conditions, maybe like some degenerative diseases, but not sure if this is the main finding here.

E: diffuse enlargement of the rectus muscles – Wait, rectus muscles in the orbit? Oh, right, in Graves' ophthalmopathy, the eye muscles (especially the recti) can become enlarged due to inflammation and fibrosis. So the MRI might show enlargement of these muscles.

F: pituitary adenoma – Pituitary issues can cause various symptoms, but the main issue here is hyperthyroidism, which is more likely from Graves' rather than a pituitary tumor, unless it's causing secondary issues, but that's less likely in this context.

G: dilated ventricles – That's more about brain atrophy or hydrocephalus, not directly related to thyroid issues.

H: cerebral aneurysm – Unlikely, as the symptoms don't point to neurological issues like that.

I: inflammation of the optic nerve – Optic neuritis can cause issues, but the main problem here is exophthalmos and orbital inflammation, not necessarily optic nerve inflammation.

J: brain metastases – Again, no indication of cancer or metastatic disease here.

So, putting it all together, the key findings on MRI would likely show enlargement of the rectus muscles in the orbits, which is option E. The inflammation in the orbit can cause these muscles to swell, leading to exophthalmos. The MRI would show this enlargement, which is a typical finding in Graves' ophthalmopathy.

The patient presents with symptoms indicative of Graves' disease, including hyperthyroidism, goiter, and Graves' ophthalmopathy. The MRI is expected to show diffuse enlargement of the rectus muscles in the orbits due to inflammation and fibrosis, a hallmark of this condition.

Answer: E
