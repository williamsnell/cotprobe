Okay, so I've got this question about the reflex arc and the path of an impulse. Hmm, I remember that a reflex arc is the pathway that nerve impulses take during a reflex action. Let me think about the components involved.

First, the process starts with a stimulus. The part that detects the stimulus is called the receptor. So the first step should be the receptor. Then, the impulse travels along a neuron. Wait, what's the difference between afferent and efferent neurons? Oh right, afferent neurons are the ones that carry signals from the receptor to the central nervous system, like the brain or spinal cord. So after the receptor, it's the afferent neuron.

Once the signal reaches the central nervous system, it probably connects with an interneuron. Interneurons are the ones that relay the signal within the CNS. So after the afferent neuron comes the interneuron. Then, the signal needs to go out to the effector, which could be a muscle or a gland. The efferent neuron is responsible for carrying the signal from the CNS to the effector. So after the interneuron, it's the efferent neuron, and finally, the effector.

Putting it all together, the order should be: receptor → afferent neuron → interneuron → efferent neuron → effector. Now I need to look at the options to see which one matches this order.

Looking at option J: receptor, afferent neuron, interneuron, efferent neuron, effector. That's exactly the sequence I thought of. Let me check the other options quickly to make sure I'm not missing anything.

Option A starts with interneuron, which doesn't make sense because the first part is the receptor. Option B starts with effector, which is the last part. Option C has sensory neuron, which I think is the same as afferent, but the order is off. Option D has afferent then efferent, which skips the interneuron in the middle. Option E has efferent before interneuron and the wrong ending. Option F starts with efferent, which is incorrect. Option G has afferent then efferent, missing interneuron. Option H is all mixed up. Option I starts with afferent, which comes after the receptor. So J is definitely the correct one.

The correct sequence for the reflex arc is receptor → afferent neuron → interneuron → efferent neuron → effector. Among the options provided, option J matches this order perfectly.

Answer: J
