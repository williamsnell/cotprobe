Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the smallest whole number that satisfies three different remainder conditions when divided by 4, 3, and 5. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem states that the number leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 4. So, mathematically, that means the number N can be expressed as N = 4k + 1 for some integer k. Similarly, when N is divided by 3, it also leaves a remainder of 1, so N can be written as N = 3m + 1 for some integer m. Lastly, when N is divided by 5, the remainder is 2, so N = 5n + 2 for some integer n.

Hmm, so I'm looking for a number that fits all three equations. Maybe I can approach this using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, but since the moduli (4, 3, 5) are not all coprime (4 and 3 are coprime, but 4 and 5 are also coprime, as are 3 and 5), so maybe it's possible to find a common solution.

Let me start by listing numbers that satisfy each condition and see where they overlap.

Starting with the first condition: N ≡ 1 mod 4. So the possible numbers are 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41, 45, 49, 53, 57, 61, 65, 69, 73, 77, 81, etc.

Next, the second condition: N ≡ 1 mod 3. The numbers here are 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, 34, 37, 40, 43, 46, 49, 52, 55, 58, 61, 64, 67, 70, 73, 76, 79, 82, 85, etc.

Looking for common numbers in both lists so far. Let's see: 1 is in both, but then the next is 13, 25, 37, 49, 61, 73, 85, etc. So the common numbers are 1, 13, 25, 37, 49, 61, 73, 85, etc. These are numbers that satisfy both N ≡1 mod4 and N≡1 mod3.

Now, the third condition is N ≡2 mod5. So let's check which of the numbers from the overlapping list also satisfy this.

Let me take the numbers one by one:

1: 1 divided by 5 is 0 with remainder 1. So no, because we need remainder 2.

13: 13 ÷5 is 2 with remainder 3. So no.

25: 25 ÷5 is 5 with remainder 0. No.

37: 37 ÷5 is 7 with remainder 2. Yes! So 37 satisfies all three conditions.

Wait, but I should check if there's a smaller number than 37 that meets all three conditions. Let's see: the next number after 1 that I had in the overlapping list was 13, which didn't work, then 25, which didn't, then 37, which did. So 37 is the first one that meets all conditions.

But wait, let me double-check in case I missed a smaller number. Let me think: the next number after 1 that meets both mod4 and mod3 conditions is 13, which didn't work for mod5. Then 25, which also didn't work. Then 37 works, so 37 is the smallest.

Looking at the options provided: the options are A:72, B:76, C:67, D:64, E:57, F:45, G:43, H:55, I:81, J:37.

So J is 37, which I just determined is the answer. Let me confirm quickly: 37 ÷4 is 9 with remainder 1. 37 ÷3 is 12 with remainder 1. 37 ÷5 is 7 with remainder 2. Yep, that's correct.

The smallest number that satisfies all three conditions is 37.

Answer: J
