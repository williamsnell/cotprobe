Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question here about whether certain statements about products being odd or even are true. I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through each option step by step.

First, I remember that when multiplying numbers, the result's parity (whether it's odd or even) depends on the factors. Specifically, if at least one of the numbers is even, the product will be even. Only if both numbers are odd will the product be odd. So, that's the key rule I need to apply here.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: The product of 7 x 5 is odd because both factors are even. Wait, 7 and 5 are both odd numbers. So their product should be odd. But the reason given is because both are even, which is incorrect. So this statement is false.

Option B: The product of 3 x 3 is odd because one of the factors is odd. Hmm, 3 times 3 is 9, which is indeed odd. But the reasoning is wrong because both factors are odd, not just one. So the conclusion is correct, but the reasoning is wrong. Wait, does the question ask about the statement's truth, regardless of the reason? Or does it require the reason to be correct too? The question says "Which statement is true?" So I think the statement's overall correctness matters. The statement says it's odd because one factor is odd. But since both are odd, the reasoning is incomplete. So maybe the statement is not entirely correct because the reason is wrong, even though the fact is right. Hmm, maybe I should consider that the statement is incorrect because the reason is wrong.

Option C: The product of 5 x 2 is even because both factors are even. Wait, 5 is odd and 2 is even. So the product is 10, which is even. The reason given says both are even, which is wrong because 5 is odd. So the statement is incorrect because the reason is wrong, even though the product is even.

Option D: The product of 6 x 2 is odd because one of the factors is odd. 6 is even, 2 is even. So 6x2 is 12, which is even. The statement says it's odd, which is wrong. So this is false.

Option E: The product of 2 x 2 is odd because both factors are even. 2x2 is 4, which is even. The statement claims it's odd, so it's false.

Option F: The product of 2 x 7 is even because both factors are odd. 2 is even, 7 is odd. The product is 14, which is even. The reasoning says both are odd, which is wrong because 2 is even. So the statement is incorrect because the reason is wrong, even though the product is even.

Option G: The product of 8 x 4 is even because one of the factors is odd. 8 and 4 are both even, so their product is 32, which is even. The statement says it's even because one factor is odd, which is incorrect. So the statement is false.

Option H: The product of 4 x 4 is odd because both factors are even. 4x4 is 16, which is even. The statement says it's odd, so it's wrong.

Option I: The product of 5 x 3 is odd because both factors are odd. 5 and 3 are both odd, so 5x3=15, which is odd. The reasoning is correct because both factors are odd. So this statement is true.

Option J: The product of 3 x 7 is even because both factors are odd. 3 and 7 are odd, so their product is 21, which is odd. The statement says it's even, which is wrong. So this is false.

Wait, let me double-check each option to make sure I didn't miss anything.

Looking back, I think Option I is the only one where the statement is correct both in the result and the reasoning. All other options either have the wrong result or the wrong reasoning.

So the correct answer should be Option I.

The correct answer is I because the product of 5 x 3 is odd, and both factors are odd, making the reasoning correct.
