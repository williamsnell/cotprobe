Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the power absorbed by a circuit element at a specific time. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

First, the question says that the current i₁ enters the positive terminal of a circuit element across which the voltage v₁ is present. I need to find the power being absorbed by the element at t=10 seconds. The current i₁ is given as 2e^(-0.1t) Amperes. The voltage v₁ is given in two parts for options (a) and (b). Wait, actually looking back, the options are labeled (a) and (b), but the choices for the answers are A to J. Hmm, maybe I need to consider both expressions for v₁ and compute the power for each, then see which pair matches the options.

Wait, no, the question says "Find the power being absorbed by the element at t = 10s if i₁ = ... and A (a) ν₁ = ... (b) ν₁ = ...". Oh, I think (a) and (b) are two different scenarios for v₁, and I need to compute the power for each. So I'll have two power values, one for each case, and then see which option (A-J) matches both.

Wait, actually, the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again. It says, "the voltage v₁ is present. Find the power being absorbed by the element at t=10s if i₁ = 2e^(-0.1)t A and A (a) v₁ = 6 (di₁/dt) (b) v₁ = (1/6)^t ∫i₁ dt + 2 V." Oh, maybe (a) and (b) are two separate scenarios, so I need to compute the power for each case (a and b) and then see which option gives the correct pair.

Wait no, perhaps (a) and (b) are two parts of the same problem. Let me think. The way it's written is a bit unclear. Maybe the voltage v₁ is given by option (a) in one case and by option (b) in another case. So I need to find the power for both scenarios and then see which of the given options (A-J) gives both correct values.

Alternatively, maybe the question is giving two expressions for v₁, and I have to compute the power for each and then see which pair of answers matches one of the options. So let's proceed under that assumption.

Power absorbed by the element is calculated as P = v₁ * i₁, right? Because power is voltage multiplied by current. But wait, the sign depends on the direction of current and voltage. Since the current enters the positive terminal, that means the power is being absorbed if the voltage is positive in the same direction as the current. So P = v₁(t) * i₁(t), and the sign will indicate whether it's absorbed or supplied.

First, let's compute the power for case (a): v₁ = 6 * (di₁/dt).

Compute di₁/dt first. i₁ = 2e^(-0.1t). The derivative of i₁ with respect to t is di₁/dt = 2*(-0.1)e^(-0.1t) = -0.2 e^(-0.1t).

So v₁(a) = 6 * (-0.2 e^(-0.1t)) = -1.2 e^(-0.1t).

Now, compute P(a) = v₁(a) * i₁(t) = (-1.2 e^(-0.1t)) * (2 e^(-0.1t)) = (-1.2 * 2) e^(-0.2t) = -2.4 e^(-0.2t).

Wait, but wait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it as v₁ * i, which is (-1.2 e^(-0.1t)) * (2 e^(-0.1t)) ) = (-2.4) e^(-0.2t). Hmm, that's correct.

Now, at t=10s, compute e^(-0.2*10) = e^(-2) ≈ 0.1353.

So P(a) = -2.4 * 0.1353 ≈ -0.3247 W, approximately -0.325 W.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. e^(-2) is about 0.135335283.

So 2.4 * 0.135335283 ≈ 0.32480468. So with the negative sign, it's -0.3248 W, which is approximately -0.325 W.

Now, moving to case (b): v₁ = (1/6)^t ∫i₁ dt + 2 V.

First, compute the integral of i₁(t) from 0 to t. i₁(t) = 2 e^(-0.1t), so ∫i₁ dt from 0 to t is ∫2 e^(-0.1t) dt from 0 to t.

The integral of e^(-at) is (-1/a)e^(-at), so ∫2 e^(-0.1t) dt = 2 * [ (-10)e^(-0.1t) ] evaluated from 0 to t.

So that's 2 * [ (-10 e^(-0.1t)) - (-10 e^0) ] = 2 * [ (-10 e^(-0.1t) + 10) ] = 2 * (10 - 10 e^(-0.1t)) ) = 20 (1 - e^(-0.1t)).

So now, v₁(b) = (1/6)^t * [20 (1 - e^(-0.1t))] + 2 V.

Wait, (1/6)^t is the same as 6^(-t). Let's compute each part at t=10.

First, compute (1/6)^10. Since 6^10 is 60,466,176, so (1/6)^10 ≈ 1.65377e-8. That's a very small number.

So (1/6)^10 ≈ 1.65377e-8. Now, 20 (1 - e^(-0.1*10)) = 20 (1 - e^(-1)).

e^(-1) ≈ 0.367879441, so 1 - 0.367879441 ≈ 0.632120559. Multiply by 20: 20 * 0.632120559 ≈ 12.64241118.

So the first term in v₁(b) is (1.65377e-8) * 12.64241118 ≈ 2.092e-7 V, which is approximately 0 V because it's so small.

So v₁(b) ≈ 0 V + 2 V = 2 V.

Now, compute P(b) = v₁(b) * i₁(t) at t=10s.

i₁(10) = 2 e^(-0.1*10) = 2 e^(-1) ≈ 2 * 0.367879441 ≈ 0.735758882 A.

So P(b) = 2 V * 0.735758882 A ≈ 1.471517764 W, which is approximately 1.4715 W. Wait, but none of the options have a positive 1.47 W. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation of v₁(b). The expression is (1/6)^t multiplied by the integral of i₁ from 0 to t, which we found as 20(1 - e^(-0.1t)), plus 2 V.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the integral. Let me recheck the integral.

Wait, the integral of i₁(t) from 0 to t is ∫2 e^(-0.1t) dt from 0 to t.

The integral of e^(-at) dt is (-1/a) e^(-at), so ∫2 e^(-0.1t) dt = 2 * [ (-10) e^(-0.1t) ] from 0 to t.

So evaluating at t: 2*(-10) e^(-0.1t) = -20 e^(-0.1t).

At t=0: -20 e^0 = -20.

So the definite integral is (-20 e^(-0.1t)) - (-20) ) = 20 (1 - e^(-0.1t)).

Yes, that was correct. So at t=10, the integral is 20*(1 - e^(-1)) ≈ 20*(0.63212) ≈ 12.6424.

Then, multiply by (1/6)^10, which is 1.65377e-8. So 12.6424 * 1.65377e-8 ≈ 2.092e-7 volts, which is negligible. So v₁(b) is approximately 2 V.

So P(b) = v₁(b) * i₁(t) = 2 V * 0.735758882 A ≈ 1.4715 W. Wait, but in the options, the second value is between 2.98 W and 3.2 W. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me check the problem statement again.

Wait, the problem says v₁ = (1/6)^t ∫i₁ dt + 2 V. Oh wait, I think I made a mistake in the expression. The integral of i₁ dt from 0 to t is 20(1 - e^(-0.1t)), so then (1/6)^t times that integral plus 2 V.

Wait, but at t=10, (1/6)^10 is a very small number, so the first term is negligible, making v₁ ≈ 2 V. Then i₁ is about 0.73576 A, so P = 2 * 0.73576 ≈ 1.4715 W. But the options don't have a positive 1.47 W. The options for the second part are around 3 W. So perhaps I made a mistake in computing v₁(b).

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the expression for v₁(b). Let me check again. The problem says v₁ = (1/6)^t ∫i₁ dt + 2 V. Oh wait, perhaps the integral is from 0 to t, which we have, and then multiplied by (1/6)^t.

But maybe I should compute (1/6)^t multiplied by the integral, so that's (1/6)^t * [20(1 - e^(-0.1t))] + 2 V.

Wait, but even if I compute (1/6)^t * 20(1 - e^(-0.1t)) at t=10, it's still a very small number, so v₁ is approximately 2 V. So P = 2 * i₁(10) ≈ 2 * 0.73576 ≈ 1.4715 W. But this doesn't match any of the options given for the second part, which are all around 3 W. So maybe I'm making a mistake in the integration or the expression.

Wait, perhaps the integral is not from 0 to t, but maybe the integral is indefinite, but that's unlikely. Or perhaps the expression is (1/6)^t multiplied by the integral, which is 20(1 - e^(-0.1t)), so maybe I should compute it correctly.

Wait, let me compute (1/6)^t * 20(1 - e^(-0.1t)) at t=10.

(1/6)^10 ≈ 1.65377e-8.

20*(1 - e^(-1)) ≈ 20*0.63212 ≈12.6424.

Multiply them: 1.65377e-8 * 12.6424 ≈ 2.092e-7 V, which is 0.0000002092 V, almost zero.

So v₁(b) = 0.0000002092 V + 2 V ≈ 2.0000002092 V.

So v₁ ≈ 2 V, and i₁ ≈ 0.73576 A.

So P = 2 * 0.73576 ≈ 1.4715 W. Hmm, but the options don't have a positive 1.47 W. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expression for v₁(b). Let me re-examine the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says: "v₁ = (1/6)^t ∫i₁ dt + 2 V." Did I compute the integral correctly?

Yes, I think so. The integral of i₁(t) from 0 to t is correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the power. Wait, but P = v₁ * i₁, which is 2 * 0.73576 ≈ 1.4715 W. But none of the options have this value. So maybe I misread the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that v₁ is given by option (a) and option (b), and I'm supposed to compute both and see which option has both values.

Wait, perhaps I got the cases wrong. Let me check the options again. The options are pairs, like A is (-0.34, 3.00), B is (-0.35,3.05), etc. So perhaps I'm supposed to compute the power for each case (a and b) and then see which pair matches.

Wait, but in case (a), I got P(a) ≈ -0.325 W, and in case (b), P(b) ≈ 1.47 W. But in the options, the first number is negative and the second is around 3 W. So perhaps I made a mistake in case (b).

Wait, perhaps I misread the expression for v₁(b). Let me read again: v₁ = (1/6)^t ∫i₁ dt + 2 V. Wait, did I compute the integral correctly? Let me recompute the integral.

i₁(t) = 2 e^(-0.1t). The integral from 0 to t is ∫2 e^(-0.1t) dt.

Let me compute that again.

The integral of e^(-at) is (-1/a) e^(-at), so ∫2 e^(-0.1t) dt = 2 * (-10) e^(-0.1t) + C.

Evaluated from 0 to t: [ -20 e^(-0.1t) ] from 0 to t = (-20 e^(-0.1t)) - (-20 e^0) ) = -20 e^(-0.1t) + 20 = 20 (1 - e^(-0.1t)).

Yes, that's correct.

So v₁(b) = (1/6)^t * 20(1 - e^(-0.1t)) + 2 V.

At t=10, (1/6)^10 ≈ 1.65377e-8, and 1 - e^(-1) ≈ 0.63212. So 20 * 0.63212 ≈12.6424. Multiply by 1.65377e-8: 12.6424 * 1.65377e-8 ≈ 2.092e-7 V.

So v₁(b) ≈ 2.0000002092 V, which is very close to 2 V.

Now, i₁(10) = 2 e^(-1) ≈ 0.735758882 A.

So P(b) = v₁(b) * i₁(10) ≈ 2 * 0.735758882 ≈1.4715 W. But the options don't have this value. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait a minute, perhaps the expression for v₁(b) is different. Let me check again: ν₁ = (1/6)^t ∫i₁ dt + 2 V.

Wait, could it be that the integral is from 0 to t, but I might have miscalculated (1/6)^t? Let me compute (1/6)^10 again.

(1/6)^10 is 1/(6^10). 6^10 is 60,466,176, so 1/60,466,176 ≈ 1.65377e-8. That's correct.

Hmm, maybe I should consider that (1/6)^t is actually e^{-t ln 6}, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me think again. The problem says "the current i₁ enters the positive terminal of a circuit element across which the voltage v₁ is present." So the power is P = v₁ * i₁. But the sign depends on the direction. If the current enters the positive terminal, then the power is positive if v₁ is positive in the same direction as the current. So if v₁ is positive at the terminals where current is entering, then P is positive, meaning power is absorbed. If v₁ is negative, then P is negative, meaning power is supplied.

Wait, but in case (a), v₁ = 6 di₁/dt, which we found to be negative, so P = v₁ * i₁ is negative, meaning the element is supplying power. But in case (b), v₁ is approximately 2 V, and i₁ is positive, so P is positive, meaning the element is absorbing power.

Wait, but in the options, the first value is negative and the second is positive. So perhaps I'm supposed to compute both cases and find which option matches both P(a) and P(b).

Wait, but in the options, each option is a pair, like A: (-0.34, 3.00), etc. So perhaps the question is asking for both P(a) and P(b) at t=10, and the options give the two values together. So I need to compute both.

Wait, that makes sense. So the question is, for the same element, compute the power for both expressions of v₁ given in (a) and (b), and then see which option has both values.

So in case (a), P(a) ≈ -0.325 W.

In case (b), P(b) ≈ 1.4715 W.

But looking at the options, none of them have a first value near -0.325 and a second near 1.47. All options have the second value around 3 W. So perhaps I made a mistake in computing P(b).

Wait, let me try another approach. Perhaps I made a mistake in the expression for v₁(b). Let me re-examine the problem statement.

The problem says: "ν₁ = (1/6)^t ∫i₁ dt + 2 V."

Wait, perhaps the integral is not from 0 to t, but the definite integral from 0 to t. Alternatively, perhaps the integral is ∫i₁ dt from some other limits. But no, it's ∫i₁ dt, which is indefinite, but in context, it's probably definite from 0 to t.

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the expression. Let me check: the problem says "ν₁ = (1/6)^t ∫i₁ dt + 2 V." So the integral is from 0 to t, as I thought.

Wait, perhaps the units are different. Wait, 1/6 is unitless, so (1/6)^t is unitless. The integral of i₁ dt has units of ampere-seconds (A-s), so multiplying by (1/6)^t (unitless) gives A-s, and adding 2 V doesn't make sense dimensionally. Wait, that can't be right. Oh, wait, perhaps the integral is divided by something. Wait, perhaps I misread the expression.

Wait, looking back, the problem says: "ν₁ = (1/6)^t ∫i₁ dt + 2 V." Hmm, perhaps the integral is ∫i₁(t) dt from 0 to t, which has units of A-s, and then (1/6)^t is unitless, so the term (1/6)^t * ∫i₁ dt has units of A-s, but adding that to volts (V) is not possible. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the expression.

Wait, maybe the expression is ν₁ = (1/6)^t multiplied by ∫i₁ dt from 0 to t, plus 2 V. So the units would be (A-s) * (unitless) + V, which still doesn't make sense because A-s is equivalent to coulombs (C), and adding coulombs to volts isn't possible. So perhaps I misread the expression.

Wait, perhaps the expression is ν₁ = (1/6)^t multiplied by ∫i₁ dt from 0 to t, then adding 2 V. But that would give units of (A-s) + V, which is dimensionally inconsistent. So maybe I made a mistake in the expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral is divided by something. Let me check the problem statement again. It says ν₁ = (1/6)^t ∫i₁ dt + 2 V. Hmm, perhaps it's ν₁ = (1/6)^t multiplied by ∫i₁ dt from 0 to t, plus 2 V. But that would have inconsistent units.

Wait, perhaps the integral is divided by (1/6)^t. Alternatively, maybe it's ν₁ = (1/6)^t multiplied by the integral, and then that's added to 2 V. But the units still don't make sense. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the expression is ν₁ = (1/6)^t * ∫i₁ dt from 0 to t, and then add 2 V. But as I said, units don't match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the expression.

Wait, perhaps the integral is divided by (1/6)^t. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the expression is ν₁ = (1/6)^t multiplied by the integral of i₁ dt from 0 to t, but that still doesn't fix the unit issue.

Wait, perhaps the integral is of i₁(t) multiplied by something else. Alternatively, perhaps the expression is ν₁ = (1/6)^t * ∫i₁(t) dt from 0 to t, but that still has the same unit problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral is divided by (1/6)^t. Let me try that.

Wait, maybe the expression is ν₁ = (1/6)^t * ∫i₁(t) dt from 0 to t, but that would still have units of A-s, which can't be added to volts.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral is divided by (1/6)^t. Let me consider that possibility.

Wait, perhaps the expression is ν₁ = (1/6)^t multiplied by ∫i₁(t) dt from 0 to t, plus 2 V. But that would give units of A-s + V, which is impossible. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral is divided by (1/6)^t. Let me try that.

Wait, perhaps the expression is ν₁ = (1/6)^t * ( ∫i₁ dt from 0 to t ) + 2 V. But that still doesn't fix the units.

Wait, perhaps the integral is of i₁(t) multiplied by e^(-t/6), but that's not what's written.

Alternatively, perhaps the expression is ν₁ = (1/6)^t * ∫i₁ dt from 0 to t, but that would still have units of A-s, which can't be added to volts.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's proceed with the assumption that the units work out, even if they don't make dimensional sense, because perhaps it's a theoretical problem.

So, proceeding, v₁(b) ≈ 2 V, and i₁ ≈ 0.73576 A, so P = 2 * 0.73576 ≈1.4715 W.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the integral.

Wait, perhaps the integral is ∫i₁(t) dt from 0 to t, which we found to be 20(1 - e^(-0.1t)).

Then, (1/6)^t * 20(1 - e^(-0.1t)) at t=10 is 1.65377e-8 * 12.6424 ≈ 2.092e-7 V, which is negligible, so v₁ ≈2 V.

But then P = 2 * 0.73576 ≈1.4715 W.

Wait, but looking at the options, the second value is around 3 W. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute v₁(b) more accurately.

Let me compute (1/6)^10 accurately.

(1/6)^1 = 0.1666667

(1/6)^2 ≈ 0.0277778

(1/6)^3 ≈ 0.0046296

(1/6)^4 ≈ 0.0007716

(1/6)^5 ≈ 0.0001286

(1/6)^6 ≈ 0.0000214

(1/6)^7 ≈ 3.566e-6

(1/6)^8 ≈5.944e-7

(1/6)^9 ≈9.907e-8

(1/6)^10≈1.651e-8.

So, 1.651e-8.

Then, 20*(1 - e^(-1)) ≈20*(0.6321205588) ≈12.64241118.

Multiply by 1.651e-8: 12.64241118 * 1.651e-8 ≈2.092e-7 V.

So v₁(b) ≈2.0000002092 V, which is effectively 2 V.

i₁(10) = 2 e^(-1) ≈0.735758882 A.

So P(b)=2 * 0.735758882≈1.471517764 W.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that v₁(b) is given by (1/6)^t multiplied by the integral of i₁ from 0 to t, and then that's added to 2 V.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the integral correctly. Let me compute the integral again.

∫i₁ dt from 0 to t is 20(1 - e^(-0.1t)).

So at t=10, it's 20*(1 - e^(-1)) ≈20*0.63212≈12.6424.

Multiply by (1/6)^10≈1.651e-8: 12.6424 * 1.651e-8≈2.092e-7 V.

So v₁(b)≈2 V.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the negligible term and consider v₁(b)=2 V, leading to P=2 * 0.73576≈1.4715 W.

But none of the options have this value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the expression for v₁(b).

Wait, perhaps the expression is ν₁ = (1/6)^t multiplied by ∫i₁ dt from 0 to t, and then that's added to 2 V. So perhaps the integral is in volts? No, that doesn't make sense because the integral of current has units of coulombs.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the integral is divided by something else. Alternatively, perhaps the expression is ν₁ = (1/6)^t multiplied by ∫i₁ dt from 0 to t, and then that's in volts. But that would require the integral to have units of volts, which it doesn't. So perhaps I'm stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the calculations as is, even if the units don't make sense, and see which option matches the P(a) and P(b) I've computed.

So P(a) is approximately -0.325 W, and P(b) is approximately 1.4715 W. Looking at the options:

A: (-0.34, 3.00)

B: (-0.35,3.05)

C: (-0.29,3.15)

D: (-0.31,2.98)

E: (-0.32,3.0)

F: (-0.33,3.03)

G: (-0.325,3.02)

H: (-0.3,3.1)

I: (-0.28,3.2)

J: (-0.4,2.9)

None of these have the second value near 1.47 W. So perhaps I made a mistake in the expression for v₁(b).

Wait, perhaps I should check if I misread the expression. Let me read the problem statement again.

The problem says: "ν₁ = (1/6)^t ∫i₁ dt + 2 V."

Wait, perhaps it's ν₁ = (1/6)^t multiplied by the integral of i₁(t) from 0 to t, and then that's added to 2 V. But that gives v₁ in volts only if the integral is in volts, which it isn't. So perhaps the expression is incorrect, or perhaps I'm missing some scaling factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral is divided by (1/6)^t. Let me try that.

v₁(b) = ∫i₁ dt from 0 to t / (1/6)^t + 2 V.

So that would be [20(1 - e^(-0.1t))] / (1/6)^t + 2 V.

At t=10, (1/6)^10 ≈1.651e-8, so 1/(1/6)^10 = 6^10 ≈60,466,176.

So [20(1 - e^(-1))] / (1/6)^10 ≈12.6424 / 1.651e-8 ≈7.668e8 V.

Adding 2 V gives v₁(b)≈7.668e8 V. That's way too high, and P would be v₁ * i₁ ≈7.668e8 * 0.73576 ≈5.64e8 W, which is impossible. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the expression is ν₁ = (1/6)^t multiplied by ∫i₁ dt from 0 to t, plus 2 V.

But as before, that gives v₁ ≈2 V, leading to P≈1.47 W, which isn't in the options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the integral is of i₁(t) multiplied by (1/6)^t. Let me try that.

Alternatively, perhaps the expression is ν₁ = (1/6)^t multiplied by ∫i₁(t) dt from 0 to t, which is what I did earlier, leading to v₁≈2 V.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement has a typo, and the intended expression for v₁(b) is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the integral is divided by (1/6)^t, but that leads to a very high voltage, which isn't in the options.

Wait, maybe I should proceed with the assumption that I'm correct and the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of P(b).

Wait, let me try calculating (1/6)^t * ∫i₁ dt again.

At t=10, (1/6)^10≈1.65377e-8.

∫i₁ dt from 0 to10 is 20*(1 - e^(-1))≈12.6424.

So 1.65377e-8 *12.6424≈2.092e-7 V. So v₁(b)=2.092e-7 V +2 V≈2.0000002092 V.

So v₁(b)=2.0000002092 V, which is effectively 2 V.

i₁(10)=2 e^(-1)≈0.735758882 A.

So P=2*0.735758882≈1.4715 W.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the expression for v₁(b).

Alternatively, perhaps the expression is ν₁ = (1/6)^t multiplied by ∫i₁ dt from 0 to t, and then that's added to 2 V, but without considering the units. So I'll proceed with that, even though it doesn't make dimensional sense.

So, given that, P(b)=1.4715 W, but none of the options match this. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the integral is ∫i₁(t) dt from 0 to t, and then multiplied by (1/6)^t, and that's in volts. But as I said, that doesn't make sense dimensionally.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement has a mistake, and the correct expression for v₁(b) is different. Let me try assuming that v₁(b) is 6 times the integral of i₁ dt, similar to part (a).

Wait, but that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps v₁(b) = (1/6)^t multiplied by ∫i₁ dt from 0 to t, and that's in volts. But that would require the integral to have units of volts, which it doesn't.

At this point, I'm stuck because I can't find a way to make v₁(b) result in a power that matches the options. Perhaps I should focus back on case (a) and see which option has the first value close to -0.325 W and the second value around 3 W.

Wait, the first value I computed for case (a) is approximately -0.325 W, and the options have various pairs. The second value in the options is around 3 W, which is much higher than what I computed for case (b). So perhaps I made a mistake in case (b).

Wait, going back to case (a), perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

In case (a), v₁ =6*(di₁/dt).

i₁=2 e^(-0.1t), so di₁/dt= -0.2 e^(-0.1t).

So v₁(a)=6*(-0.2 e^(-0.1t))= -1.2 e^(-0.1t).

At t=10, e^(-1)=0.367879441.

So v₁(a)= -1.2 *0.367879441≈-0.441455329 V.

i₁(10)=2*0.367879441≈0.735758882 A.

So P(a)=v₁(a)*i₁(10)= (-0.441455329)*(0.735758882)≈-0.3248 W≈-0.325 W.

So that's correct.

Now, perhaps the question is asking for both case (a) and case (b), and the options give the two power values together. So I need to find which option has -0.325 W and the correct P(b). But since I'm getting P(b)=1.4715 W, which isn't in the options, perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute P(b) again more carefully.

Wait, in case (b), v₁(b)= (1/6)^t ∫i₁ dt +2 V.

At t=10, v₁(b)= (1/6)^10 * [20(1 - e^(-1))] +2 V.

Compute each part:

(1/6)^10≈1.65377e-8.

20*(1 - e^(-1))≈20*0.63212≈12.6424.

Multiply:1.65377e-8 *12.6424≈2.092e-7 V.

So v₁(b)=2.092e-7 V +2 V≈2.0000002092 V.

i₁(10)=2 e^(-1)≈0.735758882 A.

So P(b)=2.0000002092 *0.735758882≈1.4715 W.

But this isn't matching any option. So perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the expression for v₁(b) is different.

Wait, perhaps the expression is ν₁ = (1/6)^t multiplied by ∫i₁ dt from 0 to t, and then that's in volts. So perhaps I should compute it differently.

Wait, perhaps the integral is multiplied by (1/6)^t, but that's what I did earlier. So I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the integral is divided by (1/6)^t, leading to a very high voltage, but that doesn't fit the options either.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the integral is multiplied by (1/6)^t, but then the units still don't make sense. So perhaps the problem is intended to be solved without considering units, and I should proceed.

Given that, and considering that I'm getting P(a)≈-0.325 W and P(b)≈1.4715 W, but the options don't have this, perhaps I should look for an option where the first value is around -0.325 W and the second around 3 W, but none match. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of P(b).

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the integral is ∫i₁(t) dt from 0 to t, and then multiplied by (1/6)^t, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, perhaps the expression is ν₁ = (1/6)^t multiplied by ∫i₁(t) dt from 0 to t, and then that's in volts. So, perhaps I should compute it as:

At t=10, (1/6)^10≈1.65377e-8.

∫i₁ dt from 0 to10≈12.6424.

Multiply:1.65377e-8 *12.6424≈2.092e-7 V.

So v₁(b)=2.092e-7 V +2 V≈2.0000002092 V.

Thus, P=2 *0.735758882≈1.4715 W.

But again, this doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the integral is ∫i₁(t) dt from 0 to t, and then multiplied by (1/6)^t, but perhaps the units are in volts, so perhaps the integral is divided by some factor to make it volts. But I don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the expression is ν₁ = (1/6)^t multiplied by ∫i₁ dt from 0 to t, and then that's in volts. But without knowing the correct approach, I'm stuck.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the correct option is E: (-0.32, 3.0 W), but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in case (b) and the correct P(b) is around 3 W.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the integral differently. Let me compute ∫i₁ dt from 0 to t again.

i₁=2 e^(-0.1t).

∫i₁ dt=2 ∫e^(-0.1t) dt=2*(-10)e^(-0.1t) +C= -20 e^(-0.1t)+C.

From 0 to t: (-20 e^(-0.1t)) - (-20 e^0)= -20 e^(-0.1t)+20=20(1 - e^(-0.1t)).

So that's correct.

Now, perhaps I should consider that the expression for v₁(b) is ν₁ = (1/6)^t multiplied by ∫i₁ dt from 0 to t, without adding 2 V. Let me try that.

So v₁(b)= (1/6)^10 *20(1 - e^(-1))=1.65377e-8 *12.6424≈2.092e-7 V.

Then, P(b)=v₁(b)*i₁(10)=2.092e-7 *0.73576≈1.537e-7 W, which is negligible. But that's not matching the options either.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the expression is ν₁ = (1/6)^t multiplied by ∫i₁ dt from 0 to t, and then that's added to 2 V. So at t=10, v₁(b)=2.092e-7 V +2 V≈2.0000002092 V, leading to P=2*0.73576≈1.4715 W.

Given that, and seeing that none of the options match, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the expression for v₁(b) is different. Let me read it again: "ν₁ = (1/6)^t ∫i₁ dt + 2 V." Alternatively, perhaps it's ν₁ = (1/6)^t multiplied by ∫i₁ dt from 0 to t, plus 2 V.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the integral more accurately.

At t=10, ∫i₁ dt from 0 to10=20*(1 - e^(-1))=20*(1 - 0.367879441)=20*0.632120559≈12.64241118.

Multiply by (1/6)^10≈1.65377e-8:12.64241118 *1.65377e-8≈2.092e-7 V.

So v₁(b)=2.092e-7 +2≈2.0000002092 V.

Thus, P=2.0000002092 *0.735758882≈1.4715 W.

But the options don't have this, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the integral is ∫i₁ dt from 0 to t, and then multiplied by (1/6)^t, but perhaps the integral is in volts. But that doesn't make sense.

At this point, I'm stuck and can't find a way to make the second power value match the options. Perhaps I should consider that the correct option is E: (-0.32, 3.0), assuming that the first value is correct and the second is approximated, but I'm not sure.

To determine the power absorbed by the circuit element at \( t = 10 \, \text{s} \), we analyze two cases for the voltage \( v_1 \) given in the problem:

### Case (a): \( v_1 = 6 \frac{di_1}{dt} \)
1. **Current \( i_1 \):** \( i_1 = 2e^{-0.1t} \, \text{A} \)
2. **Derivative \( \frac{di_1}{dt} \):**  
   \[
   \frac{di_1}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( 2e^{-0.1t} \right) = -0.2e^{-0.1t}
   \]
3. **Voltage \( v_1 \):**  
   \[
   v_1 = 6 \cdot \left( -0.2e^{-0.1t} \right) = -1.2e^{-0.1t}
   \]
4. **Power \( P \):**  
   \[
   P = v_1 \cdot i_1 = \left( -1.2e^{-0.1t} \right) \cdot \left( 2e^{-0.1t} \right) = -2.4e^{-0.2t}
   \]
5. **At \( t = 10 \, \text{s} \):**  
   \[
   e^{-0.2 \cdot 10} = e^{-2} \approx 0.1353
   \]
   \[
   P = -2.4 \cdot 0.1353 \approx -0.3248 \, \text{W} \, \text{(approximately } -0.325 \, \text{W)}
   \]

### Case (b): \( v_1 = \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)^t \int_0^t i_1 \, dt + 2 \, \text{V} \)
1. **Integral \( \int_0^t i_1 \, dt \):**  
   \[
   \int_0^t 2e^{-0.1t} \, dt = 20 \left( 1 - e^{-0.1t} \right)
   \]
2. **Voltage \( v_1 \):**  
   \[
   v_1 = \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)^t \cdot 20 \left( 1 - e^{-0.1t} \right) + 2
   \]
3. **At \( t = 10 \, \text{s} \):**  
   \[
   \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)^{10} \approx 1.65377 \times 10^{-8}, \quad 1 - e^{-1} \approx 0.63212
   \]
   \[
   v_1 \approx \left( 1.65377 \times 10^{-8} \right) \cdot 20 \cdot 0.63212 + 2 \approx 2 \, \text{V}
   \]
4. **Current \( i_1 \):**  
   \[
   i_1(10) = 2e^{-1} \approx 0.73576 \, \text{A}
   \]
5. **Power \( P \):**  
   \[
   P = v_1 \cdot i_1 = 2 \cdot 0.73576 \approx 1.4715 \, \text{W}
   \]

### Matching with Options
- For **Case (a)**, \( P \approx -0.325 \, \text{W} \).
- For **Case (b)**, \( P \approx 1.4715 \, \text{W} \), but none of the options match this value. The closest match for the first value is **E: (-0.32, 3.0)**, assuming the second value is approximated or there may be an error in the problem setup.
