Okay, so I've got this question about correlation and units conversion. Let me try to think it through. 

The question says that the correlation between height in inches and weight in pounds is 0.65. Then, if the heights are converted from inches to centimeters, what will the correlation be? The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

Wait, I remember that correlation measures the linear relationship between two variables. It's a unitless measure, right? So it doesn't depend on the units of the variables. But wait, let me make sure. 

Correlation coefficient, like Pearson's r, is calculated using the covariance of the two variables divided by the product of their standard deviations. The formula is r = Cov(X,Y) / (σ_X * σ_Y). Now, if I change the units of one variable, how does that affect each part of this formula?

Let me break it down. Suppose X is height in inches and Y is weight in pounds. The covariance between X and Y is based on how much X and Y vary together. Now, if I convert X to centimeters by multiplying each inch by 2.54, the new variable X' = 2.54 * X.

What happens to the covariance when I scale X? Covariance is affected by scaling. Specifically, if you multiply X by a constant, the covariance becomes that constant multiplied by the original covariance. So Cov(X', Y) = Cov(2.54X, Y) = 2.54 * Cov(X, Y).

Now, what about the standard deviations? The standard deviation of X' would be 2.54 times the standard deviation of X, because standard deviation is the square root of the variance, and variance scales with the square of the constant. So Var(X') = (2.54)^2 * Var(X), and thus σ_X' = 2.54 * σ_X.

Similarly, the standard deviation of Y (weight in pounds) remains the same because we're only changing X.

Putting it all together, the correlation coefficient after scaling X would be:

r' = Cov(X', Y) / (σ_X' * σ_Y) = (2.54 * Cov(X,Y)) / (2.54 * σ_X * σ_Y) 

The 2.54 cancels out in numerator and denominator, so r' = Cov(X,Y)/(σ_X * σ_Y) = r.

Oh, so the correlation remains the same. That means converting the units doesn't change the correlation coefficient. It's because scaling a variable affects both the covariance and its standard deviation in a way that cancels each other out when calculating r.

So in this case, the original correlation is 0.65. After converting height to centimeters, the correlation should still be 0.65. Looking at the options, J is 0.65.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Does the direction or strength change? No, because the scaling is linear, just a change in units, which doesn't affect the linear relationship's strength or direction. So yes, the correlation remains the same.

The correlation coefficient is unaffected by linear transformations of the variables, such as converting inches to centimeters. Scaling one variable by a constant factor does not change the strength or direction of the relationship. Therefore, the correlation remains 0.65.

Answer: J
