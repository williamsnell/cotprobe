Question:

A state has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor for any person to smoke a cigarette, cigar, or pipe in any restaurant, bar, cafe, or other establishment within the state. A defendant was tried in state court for violating the anti-smoking statute. The prosecution's evidence consisted of testimony regarding the defendant's cigarette smoking at a restaurant. During the prosecution's case-in-chief, they called a witness who testified to a prior conviction of the defendant that had been excluded by the judge in a pretrial hearing. The judge immediately granted a mistrial and excused the jury. The state prosecutor appealed the ruling under a statute that permitted prosecutorial appeals in such circumstances. The state won the appeal, but the prosecutor decided not to re-prosecute the defendant. However, the city attorney from the city in which the restaurant was located then sought to prosecute the defendant for the same incident under the city's anti-smoking ordinance, which was identical to the state statute. The city attorney planned to call as her only witness a man who testified at the defendant's first trial. The defendant moved to dismiss on the grounds that the prosecution of the city charge would violate his rights against double jeopardy. The court should

Options:

A: deny the motion, because the judge granted a mistrial.
B: grant the motion, because it is the same incident being prosecuted.
C: grant the motion, because the city attorney is using the same witness.
D: grant the motion, because the law and the evidence will be identical at the second trial.
E: deny the motion, because the city's anti-smoking ordinance is separate from the state statute.
F: grant the motion, because jeopardy attached in the first prosecution.
G: deny the motion, because the city has its own jurisdiction.
H: grant the motion, because the defendant was not re-prosecuted by the state.
I: deny the motion, because the city and the state are separate sovereigns.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this double jeopardy question. Let me go through it step by step. 

First, the scenario: there's a state statute and a city ordinance, both making it a crime to smoke in certain places. The defendant was tried under the state law but the trial ended with a mistrial because the prosecution mistakenly brought up a prior conviction. The state appealed and won, but then the state prosecutor decided not to re-prosecute. Now, the city attorney is prosecuting the same defendant for the same incident under the city's ordinance. The defendant is arguing that this violates double jeopardy.

Double jeopardy protects against being tried twice for the same offense after a conviction or acquittal. But here, the first trial ended with a mistrial, and the state isn't prosecuting anymore, but the city is. So I need to think about whether the city is a separate sovereign or not.

Wait, the state and the city—since the city is a political subdivision of the state, does that count as the same sovereign? Or are they separate? I remember the dual sovereignty doctrine, which says that the state and federal governments are separate sovereigns, so a person can be tried in both. But cities are part of the state, so maybe not separate.

Wait, but in some cases, if a city has its own ordinance, are they considered separate? Or does the fact that it's the same offense under state and city law matter? The ordinances are identical, so the same conduct is being prosecuted.

In the first trial, the state's case ended with a mistrial. Mistrials can sometimes mean that the prosecution can try again, but here the state decided not to. Now the city is prosecuting. But under double jeopardy, if the same sovereign prosecutes again, that's a problem. But if it's a different sovereign, it's allowed.

Wait, the issue is whether the city is a separate sovereign from the state. I think in the US, states and the federal government are separate, but cities are not separate from the state. So the city's prosecution would be under the same sovereign as the state. If that's the case, then prosecuting again would be double jeopardy.

But wait, the defendant moved to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds because the same incident is being prosecuted again. So if the city is part of the same sovereign (the state), then the second prosecution would be against double jeopardy.

But wait, the first trial ended with a mistrial. Does that affect it? Typically, a mistrial doesn't end the jeopardy if it's granted on the defendant's motion, but here it was granted by the judge on the prosecution's error. So the mistrial was declared because of the prosecution's action, which might mean that the state can't prosecute again without consent, but the defendant could argue that the state's decision not to re-prosecute means the city can't either.

Alternatively, if the city is a separate sovereign, then it's allowed. But I'm leaning towards the idea that the city is part of the state, so same sovereign, so double jeopardy applies.

Looking at the options:

Option I says: deny the motion, because the city and state are separate sovereigns. But if they aren't, then this is wrong. I think cities are not separate sovereigns from the state, so I would be incorrect.

Option E says: deny because the city's ordinance is separate. But if it's the same sovereign, that doesn't matter. So E is incorrect.

Option F says: grant because jeopardy attached in the first prosecution. But if the city is a separate sovereign, jeopardy wouldn't have attached for them. Hmm, but if the state and city are the same sovereign, jeopardy would have attached for the city as well, so the second prosecution would be jeopardy.

Wait, but the first trial was in state court. The city is a different jurisdiction. So in terms of double jeopardy, if the same sovereign (the state) prosecutes twice, it's a problem. But if the city is a separate sovereign, it's allowed.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The state and city are both part of the same sovereign—so the state is the sovereign, and the city is a local government. So the state prosecuting and the city prosecuting would be the same sovereign, so double jeopardy would apply.

But if the city is considered a separate sovereign, then I would be wrong. But I don't think cities are separate sovereigns. The separate sovereign idea applies between the states and the federal government, not between a state and its municipalities.

Therefore, the city's prosecution would be under the same sovereign as the state, so double jeopardy would prevent it.

So looking back at the options, which one aligns with that? The defendant says the city's prosecution violates double jeopardy. The court should either grant or deny the motion.

If the court grants the motion, it's because double jeopardy applies. So the correct answer would be that the court should grant the motion because the same sovereign is prosecuting again.

Looking at the options, option H says: grant the motion, because the defendant was not re-prosecuted by the state. So that's about the same sovereign.

Alternatively, option I is about separate sovereigns, but that's incorrect because city and state are same.

So the correct answer is H or another option. Wait, let me check the options again.

Option H: grant the motion, because the defendant was not re-prosecuted by the state.

But wait, the defendant is being prosecuted by the city, which is part of the same sovereign as the state. So the state's decision not to re-prosecute doesn't mean the city can't. Or does it? Because the city is part of the same sovereign, the state, so the state's decision not to prosecute would prevent the city from doing so as well.

Alternatively, maybe the state and city are separate entities, but under the same sovereign. So if the state decides not to prosecute, the city can't use the same incident under the same sovereign.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Another angle: double jeopardy applies if the same sovereign prosecutes again. Since the city is part of the state, it's the same sovereign. So the city can't prosecute the same offense after the state has decided not to.

But wait, the state's decision not to prosecute doesn't necessarily bind the city if they are separate jurisdictions, but if they are the same sovereign, then it does.

Wait, but I think the key here is that the state and city are separate jurisdictions within the same sovereign. So in terms of double jeopardy, they are the same sovereign. So the city can't prosecute the same person for the same offense after the state has already had a mistrial.

But wait, the state's mistrial and the city's prosecution—does that count as same offense? The ordinances are identical, so yes. So the defendant is being prosecuted again for the same conduct under the same sovereign's authority.

Therefore, the motion to dismiss should be granted because it's the same sovereign, and double jeopardy applies.

Looking back at the options, option H says: grant the motion, because the defendant was not re-prosecuted by the state. That seems to suggest that since the state isn't prosecuting, the city can, but that's not right because they are the same sovereign. Alternatively, perhaps the correct reasoning is that the same sovereign can't prosecute again, regardless of whether the state is prosecuting.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is I: deny the motion, because the city and state are separate sovereigns. But I don't think cities are separate sovereigns. So that would be incorrect.

Alternatively, option E says: deny because the city's ordinance is separate. But same sovereign, same offense, so that shouldn't matter.

Wait, another thought: if the city and state are separate jurisdictions, but under the same sovereign, then the same conduct could be prosecuted under both. But in this case, the defendant was tried in state court, and the city is trying again. But under double jeopardy, if they are the same sovereign, then the city can't prosecute.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me recall: the dual sovereignty doctrine allows two prosecutions if they are by separate sovereigns. So state and federal are separate, but city and state are not. So in this case, the city is not a separate sovereign, so the same sovereign's prosecution would be double jeopardy.

Therefore, the city's prosecution would be double jeopardy, so the motion should be granted.

Looking at the options, the grant options are A, C, D, F, G, H, I.

Wait, the defendant's motion is to dismiss because it's double jeopardy. So the court should either grant or deny.

If the court grants, it's because double jeopardy applies. So which option aligns with that.

Option F: grant because jeopardy attached in the first prosecution.

But the first prosecution was the state's, and the city is a different jurisdiction. So if the same sovereign, jeopardy would have attached for the city as part of the state. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the correct answer is I: deny because city and state are separate sovereigns. But I think that's wrong. So perhaps the correct answer is H: grant because the state isn't prosecuting.

Wait, the state's decision not to prosecute might mean that the city can't, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, the city is part of the same sovereign, so the state's mistrial affects the city's prosecution.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is I: deny, because city and state are separate. But I think that's incorrect because cities aren't separate sovereigns. So perhaps the correct answer is H: grant because the defendant wasn't re-prosecuted by the state.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the state's decision not to re-prosecute means that the city can't, as they are part of the same sovereign.

So the court should grant the motion, so the correct answer is H or another grant option.

Wait, looking at the options again:

H: grant the motion, because the defendant was not re-prosecuted by the state.

I: deny the motion, because the city and state are separate sovereigns.

So if the city is not a separate sovereign, then I is incorrect, and H might be correct.

Alternatively, if the city is part of the same sovereign, then the state's decision not to prosecute would mean the city can't either, so the motion should be granted.

So the correct answer is H: grant the motion because the defendant was not re-prosecuted by the state.

Wait, that reasoning might not be correct. The reason for granting would be because the same offense is being prosecuted again by the same sovereign, not because the state didn't prosecute.

So perhaps the better reasoning is that the same sovereign can't prosecute again, so the court should grant the motion, but looking at the options, the only grant option that fits is H or I.

Wait, let me think differently. The defendant's first trial was in state court, and the city is prosecuting under its own ordinance. Since the city is a separate jurisdiction within the state, but not a separate sovereign, the same double jeopardy applies. So the city can't prosecute for the same offense after the state's mistrial.

Thus, the correct answer is that the court should grant the motion, which is option H or another.

Looking back, the options:

H: grant the motion, because the defendant was not re-prosecuted by the state.

I: deny the motion, because the city and state are separate sovereigns.

So if the city is part of the same sovereign, then I is wrong, and the court should grant the motion because it's the same sovereign, so H might be correct, but H's reasoning is about the state not re-prosecuting, which may not be the main issue.

Alternatively, the correct answer is I, but I think that's incorrect because the city isn't a separate sovereign.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is I: deny because the city and state are separate sovereigns. But I'm not sure if cities are considered separate sovereigns. I think the answer is I is incorrect, so the correct answer is H.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall the rule: municipalities are not separate sovereigns from the state. So the city and state are the same sovereign. Therefore, prosecuting the same offense under the city ordinance after the state's mistrial would violate double jeopardy.

Thus, the court should grant the motion, so the correct answer is H or another.

Looking at the options again, the correct reasoning is that the same sovereign can't prosecute again, so the city's prosecution is double jeopardy.

So the answer would be H: grant the motion, because the defendant was not re-prosecuted by the state. Or another option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is I, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, the correct answer is H.

Wait, no, I think the correct answer is I is incorrect because the city isn't a separate sovereign. So the correct answer is H.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of it this way: If the state and city are the same sovereign, then the city can't prosecute after the state's mistrial. Therefore, the motion should be granted. So the correct answer is H.

Wait, but H's reasoning is that the state didn't re-prosecute, which might not be the main reason. The main reason is that it's the same sovereign.

Looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is I is incorrect, and the correct one is H: grant the motion because the defendant wasn't re-prosecuted by the state.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I: deny because the city and state are separate sovereigns. But I think that's wrong.

Wait, another angle: the city is a separate entity from the state, but under the same sovereign. So if the state doesn't prosecute, the city can. But that's not how double jeopardy works. Once jeopardy has attached in the state, the city can't prosecute under the same sovereign.

Wait, but in this case, the state's trial ended with a mistrial, which is a type of termination of the trial. So perhaps jeopardy didn't fully attach, allowing the city to prosecute.

Wait, no, because in the state trial, jeopardy had attached when the jury was sworn in. So the city, being part of the same sovereign, can't prosecute for the same offense.

So the correct answer is that the court should grant the motion because it's the same sovereign, so double jeopardy applies. Among the options, H says: grant because the defendant was not re-prosecuted by the state. That might not be the correct reasoning, but perhaps it's the best fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I, but I think I is incorrect.

Wait, I'm getting too confused. Let me try to look up the rule. The dual sovereignty doctrine applies between state and federal governments, not between a state and its municipalities. So the city is part of the same sovereign as the state. Therefore, the city's prosecution would be double jeopardy.

So the correct answer is that the court should grant the motion because it's the same sovereign, making option H or another appropriate.

Looking at the options, the correct answer is H: grant the motion, because the defendant was not re-prosecuted by the state.

Wait, maybe the reasoning is that the state's decision not to re-prosecute means the city can't, as they're part of the same sovereign. So the answer is H.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I, but I think that's wrong.

Wait, I'm going to go with option I being incorrect because the city isn't a separate sovereign, so the correct answer is H: grant the motion, because the defendant was not re-prosecuted by the state.

The question revolves around whether the city's prosecution of the defendant for the same incident under its anti-smoking ordinance violates the double jeopardy clause after the state's mistrial. Double jeopardy protects against being tried twice for the same offense under the same sovereign authority. Since the city is a political subdivision of the state, it is part of the same sovereign, not a separate one. Therefore, prosecuting the defendant again under the city's ordinance would violate double jeopardy principles. The state's decision not to re-prosecute reinforces that the city, as part of the same sovereign, cannot pursue the case either. 

The correct answer is **H: grant the motion, because the defendant was not re-prosecuted by the state.**
