Okay, so I need to figure out the depreciation of Mr. Haines's tractor using the straight-line method over the first five years. Let me start by recalling what the straight-line method entails. From what I remember, straight-line depreciation is when the cost of an asset is evenly spread out over its useful life. So each year, the depreciation expense is the same.

Alright, the tractor cost $2,895, and the estimated salvage value after 10 years is $495. So the first thing I should do is find out the total depreciation over the 10 years. That would be the cost minus the salvage value. 

Let me calculate that: $2,895 minus $495. Let's see, 2895 - 495. Hmm, subtracting 500 would be 2395, but since it's 495, that's 5 more, so 2395 +5 = 2400. So the total depreciation over 10 years is $2,400.

Now, since it's straight-line, I need to divide this total by the useful life, which is 10 years. So $2,400 divided by 10 years. That's 2400 /10, which equals $240 per year. 

Wait, but the question is asking for the depreciation after the first five years. So I need to multiply the annual depreciation by 5. Let's see, $240 *5. 240*5 is 1200. So the depreciation after five years is $1,200.

Looking at the options, G is $1,200. So that should be the correct answer.

The straight-line depreciation per year is $240, so over five years, it's $1,200.
