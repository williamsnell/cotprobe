Alright, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the question is about calculating the New York State transfer tax based on the shares Mr. Carr sold. Hmm, okay, let's break it down.

First, I remember that transfer taxes are usually calculated based on the value of the shares and the applicable rate. The problem gives different rates depending on the par value of the stock. Par value is the face value assigned to each share by the company.

Mr. Carr sold 300 shares, each with a par value of $50 per share. Wait, so the par value per share is $50. Now, I need to see which rate applies to a $50 par value.

Looking at the rates provided:
- For stocks under $5: $0.01 (1/4) per share
- $5 to $10: $0.02 (1/2) per share
- $10 to $20: $0.03 (3/4) per share
- Over $20: $0.05 per share

Wait a second, the par value here is $50, which is way over $20. So the rate should be $0.05 per share. But let me make sure I'm reading this correctly. The rates are based on the par value of the stock, right? So each share's par value is $50, so each share would have a transfer tax of $0.05.

Now, he sold 300 shares. So the total tax would be 300 multiplied by $0.05. Let me calculate that: 300 * 0.05 = $15. So the total tax should be $15.

Wait, but let me double-check the rates. The options are A:50, B:20, C:40, D:15, E:30, F:10, G:25, H:35, I:5, J:12.50. So $15 is option D.

But hold on, another thought: sometimes transfer taxes are calculated on the total amount, not per share. So maybe I should consider the total par value first. The total par value would be 300 shares * $50 = $15,000. Then, the rate would be based on that total.

Wait, but the rates given are per share, right? Because they specify per share for each category. So it's $0.01, $0.02, etc., depending on the par value per share. So each share's rate is determined by its own par value. So since each share is $50, each is taxed at $0.05, so 300 * 0.05 = $15. That makes sense.

Alternatively, if the rate was a percentage of the total, it might be different, but here it's per share based on individual par values. So yes, $15 is the correct answer, which is option D.

The correct answer is D: $15.
