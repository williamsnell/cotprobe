Question:

Airmail Express charges for shipping small packages by integer values of weight. The charges for a weight w in pounds are as follows:
 0 < w ≤ 2 $4.00
 2 < w ≤ 5 $8.00
 5 < w ≤ 20 $15.00
 The company does not accept packages that weigh more than 20 pounds. Which of the following represents the best set of data (weights) to test a program that calculates shipping charges?

Options:

A: 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21
B: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20
C: -1, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 20
D: −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 16, 20, 22
E: −1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 16, 20
F: 0, 2, 5, 20
G: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
H: 1, 4, 16
I: -1, 0, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 21
J: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 20

Okay, so I have this question about testing a program that calculates shipping charges for Airmail Express. The shipping charges are based on the weight of the package, and they only accept packages up to 20 pounds. The charges are in three brackets: $4 for 0<w≤2, $8 for 2<w≤5, and $15 for 5<w≤20. 

The question is asking which set of weights is the best to test the program. I think the best test cases are those that cover all possible scenarios, including edge cases and invalid inputs to make sure the program handles them correctly.

Let me look at the options one by one.

Option A: 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21. Hmm, 0 is a problem because the weight must be greater than 0. Also, 21 is over 20, which isn't allowed. So this might test those edge cases but includes invalid data points.

Option B: 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20. These are all within the 2-20 range but not covering the first bracket (0-2). Also, they are even numbers, so maybe missing some critical points like exactly 2 or 5.

Option C: -1,1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,20. This includes negative weight (-1), which is invalid. Also, 1 is in the first bracket, 3 is in the second, 5 is the upper limit of the second bracket, and 20 is the max. But including a negative might test error handling, but maybe not the best if the program expects only positive weights.

Option D: -1,0,1,2,3,5,16,20,22. This has a lot of edge cases: negative (-1), zero (0), exactly 2, 5, 16, 20, and 22 (over 20). Good for testing boundaries and errors.

Option E: -1,1,2,3,5,16,20. Similar to D but without 0 and 22. Still has negative, 0 is missing but maybe they're using other test cases. Not sure.

Option F: 0,2,5,20. These are key points: 0 is on the boundary, 2 is the upper of the first bracket, 5 is the upper of the second, and 20 the upper of the third. But no invalid inputs here. It might miss testing how the program handles 0 or over 20.

Option G: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. Covers weights from 1 to 10, but misses the higher brackets (11-20) and doesn't include any invalid cases.

Option H: 1,4,16. Only three points. Not enough coverage; misses lower and higher brackets.

Option I: -1,0,2,5,10,15,20,21. Includes negative, 0, exactly 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 21 (over). This tests boundaries and invalid cases. But wait, 2 is the upper of the first bracket, 5 is the upper of the second, and 15 is in the third. 10 and 15 are within the third bracket. Also, 21 is over. So this covers a lot.

Option J: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,20. Includes 0, which is a boundary, and 20. Also includes values in all three brackets. But does it include any invalid? No, all are within the allowed range except 0, but 0 is not allowed. So the program should return an error for 0. Also, 20 is allowed.

Wait, but the question is about testing the program, so test cases should cover all possible conditions, including invalid inputs. So including negative and zero would test those cases.

Looking back, the best set should include:

- Values just below and above each bracket boundary to see if the correct charge is applied.
- The maximum allowed weight (20).
- Values over 20 to test that they're rejected.
- Values below or equal to 0 to test for invalid cases.

Looking at the options:

Option D includes -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 16, 20, 22. So it has negatives, zero, and over 20. Also, values at the boundaries (1 is 0<w≤2, 3 is 2<w≤5, 5 is the upper of the second, 16 is in the third, 20 is the max, 22 is over). This seems comprehensive.

Option I includes -1, 0, 2,5,10,15,20,21. So includes negatives, zero, 2 (upper of first), 5 (upper of second), 10 and 15 in third, 20, and 21 over. But misses 1, which is in the first bracket. So it might not cover all the brackets, especially the first one except for 2.

Option J includes 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,20. So it has 0 (invalid), 1 (first), 2 (boundary), 3 (second), 5 (boundary), 6 (third), and 20. So covers all brackets but only includes valid except 0 and 20. But misses over 20 and negative.

Option F: 0,2,5,20. Includes 0 (invalid), 2 (boundary), 5 (boundary), 20 (max). It doesn't include over 20 or negative, so might miss some cases.

Option I is missing 1, which is in the first bracket. So to cover all possible brackets, perhaps I should have a value like 1 in the first, 3 in the second, etc.

Wait, the question says "best set of data to test a program that calculates shipping charges." So the test cases should include all possible conditions, including invalid weights.

So the ideal test set would have:

- Weights that are just above each bracket (like 2.001, but since it's integer, 3 is in the second bracket)
- Weights that are just below each bracket (like 1.999, which is 1 in integers)
- The maximum weight (20)
- A weight over 20 (like 21)
- Weights less than or equal to 0 (like -1, 0)
- Also, perhaps some weights within each bracket to test calculations.

Looking at the options, which one includes these?

Option D includes -1 (invalid), 0 (invalid), 1 (first bracket), 2 (upper of first), 3 (second bracket), 5 (upper of second), 16 (third bracket), 20 (upper), 22 (over). So this covers all the necessary points.

Option I includes -1, 0, 2,5,10,15,20,21. It's missing 1, which is in the first bracket. So it might not test the first bracket correctly because 2 is the upper. So perhaps a test case with 1 is needed.

Option J includes 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,20. It has 0 (invalid), 1 (first), 2 (upper of first), 3 (second), 5 (upper of second), 6 (third), and 20 (upper). But it doesn't have anything over 20 or negative, so it's missing those invalid cases.

So the best option is D because it includes all the necessary test cases: negative, zero, the boundaries, and over 20. It covers all possible scenarios the program might encounter.

Wait, but looking again, option D is -1,0,1,2,3,5,16,20,22. So it has all the required points. But option I has -1,0,2,5,10,15,20,21. So it's missing 1 and 3, which are within the first and second brackets.

So, to make sure each bracket is tested, the test set should include at least one value in each bracket, plus the boundaries and invalids.

So the correct test cases should have:

- One value in 0<w≤2: like 1 or 2
- One value in 2<w≤5: like 3 or 4 or 5
- One value in 5<w≤20: like 6 or 10 or 15 or 20
- Also, test cases for 0, negative, and over 20.

Looking at the options:

Option D includes 1 (first), 3 (second), 16 (third), and also 0, -1, 22.

Option I includes 2 (first), 5 (second), 10,15,20 (third), and -1, 0, 21.

But option I misses a point in the first bracket below 2, like 1. So it might not test the first bracket correctly if the program expects 1 to be in the first.

So the best option would be D because it includes a point in each bracket, plus the edge cases for invalid and over.

Alternatively, option I might not cover the first bracket's lower end.

Wait, in the brackets:

0 < w ≤ 2: so any positive integer up to 2. So 1 and 2 are in this bracket.

In option D, 1 is present, so it tests that bracket.

In option I, 2 is present, but 2 is the upper boundary, so maybe not the lower part.

But the question is about the best set. So D includes more varied test cases, covering each bracket's lower and upper, plus invalids.

So the answer is D.
</think>

The best set of test weights should cover all possible scenarios, including edge cases and invalid inputs, to ensure the program correctly calculates shipping charges and handles errors. Option D includes negative, zero, and over 20-pound weights, as well as values within each shipping bracket, making it the most comprehensive choice.

Answer: D
