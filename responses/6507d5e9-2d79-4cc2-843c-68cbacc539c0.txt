Okay, so I've got this problem about an amplifier and noise. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try.

The question says the amplifier has a power gain of 20 dB. The input has 100 μW of signal power and 1 μW of noise power. The amplifier adds an additional 100 μW of noise. We need to find the output S/N ratio, noise factor, and noise figure.

First, I remember that power gain in dB can be converted to a linear scale. The formula for power gain in dB is G = 10 log(P_out / P_in). So, 20 dB would be 10^2 = 100. So the gain is 100 times in power terms.

Now, the input signal power is 100 μW. So the output signal power would be 100 μW * 100 = 10,000 μW, which is 10 mW.

The input noise power is 1 μW, but the amplifier adds another 100 μW of noise. So the total noise at the output would be the original noise amplified plus the added noise. Wait, no, wait. I think the original noise is also amplified by the gain. So the original noise is 1 μW, so amplified by 100, it becomes 100 μW. Then the amplifier adds another 100 μW of noise. So total noise is 100 + 100 = 200 μW.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

The input has two components: signal (100 μW) and noise (1 μW). The amplifier applies a power gain of 100 to both. So the output signal is 100 * 100 μW = 10,000 μW. The output from the original noise is 1 * 100 μW = 100 μW. Plus the amplifier adds 100 μW of its own noise. So total noise is 100 + 100 = 200 μW.

So the output S/N ratio is signal over noise. Signal is 10,000 μW, noise is 200 μW. So S/N = 10000 / 200 = 50. So the output S/N ratio is 50, which is 50.

Next, the noise factor, F, is the ratio of the total noise power at the output to the noise power that would have been present if the only noise were the input referred noise amplified by the gain. So the noise without the additional noise would be 100 μW. The total is 200 μW. So F = 200 / 100 = 2.

Then the noise figure is the noise factor expressed in decibels. So noise figure (NF) in dB is 10 log(F). So 10 log(2) is approximately 3 dB. Wait, 10 log(2) is about 3.01 dB, which rounds to 3 dB.

Looking at the options, option J says: Output S/N ratio:50, Noise factor:2, Noise Figure:3dB. That matches what I calculated. Let me check the other options quickly.

Option B has the same S/N and noise factor but noise figure is 2 dB. That can't be right because 10 log(2) is about 3 dB. Option J seems correct.

The output signal power is 10,000 μW, and the total noise is 200 μW, giving an S/N ratio of 50. The noise factor is 2, and the noise figure is 3 dB. 

Answer: J
