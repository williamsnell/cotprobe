Question:

A taxpayer was notified by the government that her individual income tax was underpaid by $1,012. 69. The taxpayer retained an attorney to represent her in contesting the assessment. During the preparation of his client's case, the attorney suggested that it might be a good idea if the taxpayer hired an accountant to organize her records and prepare a financial statement for the year in question. Following the attorney's advice, the taxpayer consulted an accountant, an old family friend, who prepared a financial statement, which the attorney referred to at trial. During the trial, the attorney representing the government called the accountant to testif' about statements that the taxpayer made to him. The accountant's proposed testimony is

Options:

A: inadmissible as violative of the work-product rule.
B: inadmissible, because it would be hearsay evidence.
C: inadmissible, because it would violate the taxpayer's privilege against self-incrimination.
D: inadmissible, because it would violate the taxpayer's right to privacy.
E: admissible, because it was used in the preparation of the case.
F: inadmissible, because it would violate the attorney-client privilege.
G: admissible as an admission.
H: inadmissible, because it would violate the accountant-client privilege.

Okay, so I have this question about evidence law, specifically involving a taxpayer, an attorney, and an accountant. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is that a taxpayer underpaid her income tax by $1,012.69. She hires an attorney to contest the assessment. The attorney suggests she get an accountant to organize her records and prepare a financial statement. She goes to an accountant, who is an old family friend, and that accountant prepares the financial statement. The attorney uses this at trial. Then, the government's attorney calls the accountant to testify about statements the taxpayer made to him. The question is whether the accountant's testimony about those statements is admissible.

First, I need to figure out what kind of evidence this is. The accountant is being called by the government to testify about what the taxpayer told him. So, the statements in question are what the taxpayer said to the accountant. Are these statements hearsay?

Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Here, the government is probably trying to use the statements to show that the taxpayer's financial situation was as the accountant was told, which would relate to her income and tax liability. So yes, this seems like hearsay.

But there are exceptions to the hearsay rule. One exception is the "statement against interest" exception, but that applies when the statement is against the declarant's penal interest and the declarant is unavailable. Another is the business records exception, but that's for documents, not necessarily for in-person statements.

Wait, but the accountant is a third party. The taxpayer went to the accountant for help, so their conversation would be considered. Now, in attorney-client privilege, communications are confidential, but that's between the client and attorney. Here, the taxpayer consulted an accountant at the attorney's suggestion. So, is there a privilege between the taxpayer and the accountant?

I think the accountant-client privilege is a thing, but it's more about confidential communications. However, in this case, the accountant was called by the opposing side, so the issue is whether the statements made to the accountant are protected.

Wait, but the accountant was a friend, not a professional hired by the attorney. So when the attorney told the taxpayer to get an accountant, she did, and the accountant prepared a financial statement which the attorney used. Now, the government is calling the accountant as a witness.

If the accountant is called, can he testify about what the taxpayer told him? That would be hearsay unless an exception applies.

Alternatively, maybe the accountant is testifying about his own records, like the financial statement, which could fall under the business records exception. But the question is about the statements the taxpayer made to him, not the document itself.

Another angle: The attorney-client privilege. The attorney told the taxpayer to consult the accountant. So, is the communication between the taxpayer and accountant protected by attorney-client privilege? I think not, because the attorney wasn't present, and it's the taxpayer communicating with a third party. So the privilege doesn't extend here.

Wait, but if the attorney is using the accountant as part of the case preparation, maybe the accountant's work is considered part of the attorney's work product. The work-product rule protects materials prepared in anticipation of litigation by an attorney or someone acting under the attorney's direction. If the accountant was acting at the attorney's direction, then his work might be protected.

In that case, the accountant's testimony about the statements might be inadmissible under the work-product rule because it was prepared in anticipation of litigation. So the government can't use that information against the taxpayer because it's protected as part of the attorney's preparation.

Alternatively, if the accountant was working independently, not under the attorney's direction, then maybe the work-product rule doesn't apply. But the attorney suggested she get an accountant, so perhaps the accountant's work is considered part of the attorney's team, making it work product.

So looking at the options:

A: Inadmissible as work-product. If the accountant's work was done under the attorney's direction, this could apply.

B: Hearsay. It is hearsay, but unless there's an exception, it's inadmissible. But if the work-product rule applies, that's another reason it's inadmissible.

C: Privilege against self-incrimination. That's for the individual not being compelled to testify against themselves. Not sure if that applies here, since the taxpayer isn't testifying; the accountant is.

D: Privacy. Maybe, but I think the work-product or hearsay would be more relevant.

E: Admissible because used in preparation. Wait, E says it's admissible because used in the case. But no, if it's work product, it's not admissible.

F: Attorney-client privilege. No, because the communication was with the accountant, not the attorney.

G: Admission. An admission is a statement by a party opponent. The government is the opposing party, so if the accountant is considered a party's agent, maybe. But the accountant is a third party, so I don't think it's an admission.

H: Accountant-client privilege. This would be if there's a privilege between the taxpayer and accountant. I'm not sure if that's a recognized privilege, but some jurisdictions might have accountant-client privilege. But I think the more applicable rule here is work-product.

So between A and B. The issue is whether it's hearsay or work product.

If the accountant's testimony is about statements made by the taxpayer, that's hearsay unless an exception applies. But if the work-product rule applies, then it's inadmissible regardless of hearsay.

I think the key here is that the attorney suggested the taxpayer consult the accountant, and the accountant's work was used by the attorney. So the accountant was acting under the attorney's direction, making his work subject to the work-product rule. Therefore, his testimony about what the taxpayer told him would be inadmissible as it's part of the work product.

So the answer would be A: inadmissible as violative of the work-product rule.

The scenario involves a taxpayer who consulted an accountant at the suggestion of her attorney to organize her records and prepare a financial statement. The government seeks to call the accountant to testify about statements the taxpayer made to him. The key issue is whether this testimony is admissible.

The statements in question are hearsay, as they are out-of-court statements offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. However, the work-product rule may apply, as the accountant was likely acting under the attorney's direction, making his work part of the attorney's preparation for litigation. This would protect the statements from being used by the opposing party.

Considering the options:

- **A**: Correct. The work-product rule protects materials prepared in anticipation of litigation, such as the accountant's testimony, if it was done under the attorney's direction.
- **B**: Incorrect. While the statements are hearsay, the work-product rule provides a stronger basis for inadmissibility here.
- **C**: Incorrect. The privilege against self-incrimination does not apply to the accountant's testimony.
- **D**: Incorrect. Privacy concerns are less relevant than the work-product rule.
- **E**: Incorrect. The work-product rule prevents admissibility, regardless of use in preparation.
- **F**: Incorrect. Attorney-client privilege does not apply to communications with an accountant.
- **G**: Incorrect. The accountant is not a party opponent, so this does not qualify as an admission.
- **H**: Incorrect. Accountant-client privilege, if recognized, is less applicable than the work-product rule.

Thus, the accountant's testimony is inadmissible under the work-product rule.
