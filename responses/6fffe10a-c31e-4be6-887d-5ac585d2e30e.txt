Okay, so I've got this physics problem about beat frequency. Hmm, I remember that beat frequency has something to do with two sound waves interfering with each other. Let me think. So, when two sound waves of slightly different frequencies meet, they create a beat. The beat frequency is the difference between the two frequencies, right?

The first sound source is at 500 Hz. The second one is 504 Hz. So, I guess I just subtract the two frequencies to find the beat frequency. Let me do that: 504 minus 500 equals 4 Hz. Wait, but I'm not sure if I got that right. Oh, wait, yes, I think that's correct because the beat frequency is the absolute difference between the two. So if one is higher than the other, you subtract the lower from the higher.

Looking at the options, option F is 4 Hz. So that should be the answer. But wait, what if I confused the higher and lower? No, because 504 is higher than 500. So the difference is definitely 4 Hz. Yeah, I think I'm confident with that. So the beat frequency would be 4 Hz, which is option F.

The beat frequency is calculated by subtracting the lower frequency from the higher one. Here, the frequencies are 500 Hz and 504 Hz. The difference is 504 Hz - 500 Hz = 4 Hz. Therefore, the beat frequency is 4 Hz, which corresponds to option F.

Answer: F
