Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read through the problem again and jot down the key points.

Alright, the problem is about a system consisting of 2.0 moles of CO₂ gas. Initially, it's at 25°C and 10 atm pressure, confined in a cylinder with a cross-section of 10.0 cm². The gas expands adiabatically against an external pressure of 1.0 atm, and the piston moves outwards through 20 cm. I need to calculate the change in internal energy, ΔU. The molar heat capacity at constant volume, Cv,m, is given as 28.8 J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹. The options are from A to J, with various values.

Hmm, okay. Since it's an adiabatic process, I remember that Q=0. So the first law of thermodynamics tells me that ΔU = Q + W, which simplifies to ΔU = W, where W is the work done on the system. Wait, but wait—actually, I should be careful with the sign convention. In physics, work done by the system is negative, but in chemistry, sometimes it's the opposite. Hmm, I think in chemistry, work done by the system is considered negative. So, if the gas is expanding, it's doing work on the surroundings, meaning W will be negative, and thus ΔU would be negative if the work is positive done by the system? Wait no, wait. Let me think.

Wait, no—chemistry usually defines work done on the system as positive, and work done by the system as negative. So in an expansion, the system does work on the surroundings, so W (work) is negative. So ΔU = W, so if W is negative, ΔU is negative. But wait, wait, no. Wait, the first law is ΔU = Q + W, where W is the work done on the system. So if the system does work (expansion), W is negative, so ΔU = 0 + (-W_done_by), so ΔU would be negative if the work done by the system is positive.

But wait, in this problem, the process is adiabatic, so Q=0. So ΔU equals the work done on the system. Since the gas is expanding, work is done by the system, so the work on the system is negative. So ΔU would be negative. So the answer should be negative, looking at the options, which are A: -30, B: -60, etc.

Now, the next thing is to calculate the work done. Since it's an expansion against a constant external pressure, I can use the formula for work done: W = -P_ext * ΔV. Wait, but wait, wait. Because the process is adiabatic and not necessarily reversible, but since it's against a constant external pressure, maybe we can use that formula.

Wait, but wait, in an adiabatic process for an ideal gas, the work done can also be calculated using the relation PV^γ = constant, but that's for reversible adiabatic processes. Since the external pressure is different and the process is irreversible (as it's against a constant external pressure), I can't use that formula directly. So in this case, maybe I should calculate the work using the external pressure and the change in volume.

So, the formula for work when the external pressure is constant is W = -P_ext * ΔV.

Wait, but wait: no, wait. The correct formula for work done by the system when expanding against a constant external pressure is W = -P_ext * (V_final - V_initial). But since work done on the system is considered negative in this context, and the system is expanding, it's doing positive work, so W (on the system) is negative. So yes, using W = -P_ext * ΔV.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me check. The formula for work done by the system when expanding against a constant external pressure is indeed W = -P_ext * ΔV. Because when the system expands, it's doing work on the surroundings, so the work is negative. So in terms of work done on the system, it's negative.

So, to find ΔU, I need to compute the work done on the system, which is W = -P_ext * ΔV. But wait, no, wait. The formula I remember is W = -P_ext * ΔV when the process is against a constant external pressure. So let me try to calculate this.

First, I need to find the initial and final volumes of the gas.

The cylinder has a cross-sectional area of 10.0 cm². So, the initial volume V_initial is the cross-sectional area multiplied by the initial height. Wait, but wait, the problem says that the piston moves outwards through 20 cm. So the change in volume is the cross-sectional area multiplied by the distance the piston moved. Wait, but let me think.

Wait, the initial volume is the area times the initial length of the cylinder. But I don't know the initial length. Hmm, but perhaps I can find the initial volume using the ideal gas law, since I know the initial pressure, temperature, and moles.

Yes, that makes more sense. Because the initial conditions are P_initial = 10 atm, T_initial = 25°C, which is 298.15 K, n = 2.0 mol. Using the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, so V_initial = (nRT)/P_initial.

Wait, but let's compute that. R is the gas constant, which is 8.314 J/mol·K. So V_initial = (2.0 mol * 8.314 J/mol·K * 298.15 K) / (10 atm).

Wait, but wait, the pressure is in atm, and R is in J/(mol·K), which uses Pascals. So I need to convert the pressure from atm to Pascals. 1 atm is 101325 Pa. So 10 atm is 10 * 101325 = 1,013,250 Pa.

So V_initial = (2.0 * 8.314 * 298.15) / 1,013,250.

Let me compute that step by step. First, compute numerator: 2 *8.314 = 16.628. 16.628 *298.15 ≈ let's see, 16.628 * 300 would be 4988.4, but since 298.15 is 1.85 less than 300, 16.628 * 1.85 ≈ ~30.78. So subtracting, approximately 4988.4 -30.78 ≈ 4957.62 J.

So numerator is 4957.62 J. Denominator is 1,013,250 Pa. So V_initial = 4957.62 / 1,013,250 ≈ 0.004894 m³, which is 4.894 liters. Alternatively, in cm³, since 1 m³ = 1e6 cm³, so 0.004894 m³ = 4894 cm³. Okay.

Now, the final volume V_final. The piston moves outwards by 20 cm, so the change in volume is the cross-sectional area multiplied by the distance moved. The cross-section is 10.0 cm², and the distance is 20 cm, so ΔV = 10.0 cm² * 20 cm = 200 cm³ = 0.0002 m³.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. The cross-sectional area is 10.0 cm², which is 10.0e-4 m² (since 1 cm² = 1e-4 m²). The distance moved is 20 cm, which is 0.2 m. So ΔV = area * distance = 10.0e-4 m² * 0.2 m = 2e-5 m³, which is 20 liters. Wait, but wait, 1 m³ is 1000 liters, so 2e-5 m³ is 20 liters? Wait, no, 1 m³ is 1000 liters, so 1e-3 m³ is a liter. So 2e-5 m³ is 0.02 liters, or 20 cm³. So yes, that's correct.

So V_final = V_initial + ΔV = 4.894 L + 0.02 L = 4.914 L. Wait, but wait, 4894 cm³ is 4.894 liters, and ΔV is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. So V_final = 4.894 + 0.2 = 5.094 liters. Hmm, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, 4894 cm³ is 4.894 liters, and ΔV is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. So V_final = 4.894 + 0.2 = 5.094 liters, which is 5094 cm³ or 0.005094 m³.

Now, the external pressure is 1.0 atm, which is 101325 Pa. So the work done by the system is W_by = P_ext * ΔV. But since work done by the system is negative in the system's perspective, the work done on the system is W = -P_ext * ΔV.

Wait, no, wait. The formula is W = -P_ext * ΔV, but here ΔV is positive because the system expands. So W = - (101325 Pa) * (2e-5 m³) = -101325 * 0.00002 = -20.265 J. So ΔU = W = -20.265 J, which is approximately -20 J. Looking at the options, F is -20 J.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I'm calculating this correctly. Alternatively, sometimes work is expressed as W = -P_ext * (V_final - V_initial), so in this case, V_final > V_initial, so V_final - V_initial = 0.00002 m³ (20 liters is 0.02 m³? Wait, no, 1 m³ is 1000 liters, so 20 liters is 0.02 m³? Wait, no, no. Wait, 1 m³ is 1,000,000 liters? No, wait, 1 m³ is 1000 liters. So 20 liters is 0.02 m³? No, 20 liters is 0.02 m³? No, wait, 1 liter is 0.001 m³, so 20 liters is 0.02 m³. Oh, right.

Wait, but earlier I thought ΔV was 0.00002 m³, which is 20 liters. Wait, no, 0.00002 m³ is 20 liters? No, because 1 m³ is 1000 liters, so 0.00002 m³ is 0.02 liters. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me compute the units correctly.

Wait, cross-sectional area is 10.0 cm². 1 cm² is (0.01 m)^2 = 1e-4 m². So 10 cm² is 10 *1e-4 = 1e-3 m². The distance moved is 20 cm, which is 0.2 m. So ΔV = area * distance = 1e-3 m² * 0.2 m = 2e-4 m³. Which is 200 liters, because 1 m³ = 1000 liters, so 2e-4 m³ = 0.2 m³ = 200 liters. Wait, that can't be right because 2e-4 m³ is 0.0002 m³, which is 0.2 liters. Wait, no! Wait, 1 m³ is 1000 liters, so 0.0002 m³ is 0.2 liters. So ΔV is 0.2 liters or 0.0002 m³.

So P_ext is 1.0 atm = 101325 Pa. So W = - P_ext * ΔV = -101325 Pa * 0.0002 m³ = -20.265 J. So ΔU = W, which is -20.265 J, approximately -20 J. So option F is -20 J.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake earlier because when calculating V_initial, I got 4.894 liters, and ΔV is 0.2 liters, so V_final is 5.094 liters.

But wait, let me recheck the calculation for V_initial. Using nRT/P.

n=2 mol, R=8.314 J/mol·K, T=298.15 K, P=10 atm = 1,013,250 Pa.

So V = (2 * 8.314 * 298.15) / 1,013,250.

Compute numerator: 2 *8.314 = 16.628. 16.628 *298.15 ≈ let's compute accurately.

16.628 * 300 = 4988.4, but subtract 16.628 * 1.85 (since 300 - 298.15 = 1.85).

16.628 *1.85: 16 *1.85=29.6, 0.628 *1.85≈1.1654. So total ≈29.6 +1.1654=30.7654. So 4988.4 -30.7654=4957.6346 J.

So V = 4957.6346 / 1,013,250 ≈ 0.004893 m³, which is 4.893 liters. So that's correct.

Then, ΔV is 0.0002 m³, which is 0.2 liters. So yes, that's correct.

So W = -101325 * 0.0002 = -20.265 J. So ΔU = W = -20.265 J. So the closest option is F: -20 J.

Wait, but wait another thought. Since the process is adiabatic, but the expansion is against a constant external pressure, the work done is indeed calculated as P_ext * ΔV, but I'm wondering whether the internal pressure changes. But no, since the system does work against the external pressure, this approach is correct.

Alternatively, I could consider that in an adiabatic process, ΔU = -W, since Q=0. Wait, no, because the first law is ΔU = Q + W, where W is work done on the system. So if work is done by the system, W is negative, so ΔU = -W_system, where W_system is positive when work is done by the system.

Wait, but in this case, W (on the system) is negative because the system is doing work. So ΔU = W = negative.

Wait, but I think I did it right earlier. So the answer should be F: -20 J.

Wait, but wait another point: the process is adiabatic, which means no heat exchange, so all the work done is accounted for in the internal energy change. So yes, ΔU = W.

But let me make sure that the work is calculated correctly. So the formula I used is correct: W = -P_ext * ΔV. Here, ΔV is positive because the volume increases, so W is negative. So ΔU = W = -20.265 J, approximately -20 J.

So the correct answer should be F: -20 J. Looking at the options, F is -20 J.
</think>

To solve the problem, we start by noting that the process is adiabatic, meaning \( Q = 0 \). From the first law of thermodynamics, \( \Delta U = Q + W \), so \( \Delta U = W \), where \( W \) is the work done on the system. Since the gas expands, it does work on the surroundings, making \( W \) negative.

The work done by the system during an expansion against a constant external pressure is given by:

\[
W_{\text{by}} = -P_{\text{ext}} \Delta V
\]

Thus, the work done on the system is:

\[
W = -P_{\text{ext}} \Delta V
\]

### Step 1: Calculate Initial Volume
Using the ideal gas law, \( PV = nRT \), the initial volume \( V_{\text{initial}} \) is:

\[
V_{\text{initial}} = \frac{nRT}{P_{\text{initial}}}
\]

Given:
- \( n = 2.0 \, \text{mol} \)
- \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K} \)
- \( T = 298.15 \, \text{K} \)
- \( P_{\text{initial}} = 10 \, \text{atm} = 1,013,250 \, \text{Pa} \)

\[
V_{\text{initial}} = \frac{2.0 \times 8.314 \times 298.15}{1,013,250} \approx 0.004894 \, \text{m}^3 = 4.894 \, \text{L}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Change in Volume
The piston moves outward by \( 20 \, \text{cm} \), and the cross-sectional area of the cylinder is \( 10.0 \, \text{cm}^2 \). The change in volume \( \Delta V \) is:

\[
\Delta V = \text{Area} \times \text{Distance} = 10.0 \, \text{cm}^2 \times 20 \, \text{cm} = 200 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0002 \, \text{m}^3
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Work Done
The external pressure is \( P_{\text{ext}} = 1.0 \, \text{atm} = 101,325 \, \text{Pa} \). The work done on the system is:

\[
W = -P_{\text{ext}} \Delta V = -(101,325) \times (0.0002) \approx -20.265 \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( \Delta U \)
Since \( \Delta U = W \), we have:

\[
\Delta U \approx -20.265 \, \text{J}
\]

Rounding to the nearest option, \( \Delta U \approx -20 \, \text{J} \).

### Final Answer:
F
