Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about factors that increase the risk of lung cancer. Let's see, the options are A through J. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that lung cancer is mostly caused by smoking, but there are other factors too. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Saturated fat. I'm not too sure about this. I know that saturated fats are linked to heart disease, but do they cause lung cancer? Maybe not directly, but maybe through other mechanisms. Not sure.

Option B: High fiber diet. High fiber is generally good for you, right? It helps with digestion and can reduce the risk of colon cancer. So probably not increasing lung cancer risk. Maybe even the opposite.

Option C: Eating citrus fruits. Citrus fruits are high in vitamin C and antioxidants. Antioxidants help fight free radicals, which are linked to cancer. So eating them might reduce risk, not increase it.

Option D: Alcohol. I know that alcohol is a risk factor for several cancers, like liver and mouth cancer. But how about lung cancer? I think it does increase the risk, especially when combined with smoking. So D could be a contender.

Option E: Lack of physical activity. Physical activity is good for overall health. Lack of it can lead to obesity and maybe other issues, but does it directly cause lung cancer? I'm not sure. Maybe it's a minor factor.

Option F: Low protein intake. Protein is important, but low intake might not directly cause lung cancer. More linked to muscle wasting or other health issues, but not sure about cancer risk.

Option G: Vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D is important for bone health and has some role in cancer prevention. I think deficiency might increase cancer risk, but I'm not certain about lung cancer specifically.

Option H: Obesity. Obesity is a risk factor for several cancers, including breast, colon, and maybe lung. Because fat cells produce more estrogen and other hormones that can promote cancer growth. So H is a possibility.

Option I: High dose ß-carotene supplements. Wait, I remember something about beta-carotene supplements. I think in some studies, high doses might actually increase the risk of lung cancer, especially in smokers. So I could be the correct answer.

Option J: Drinking green tea. Green tea is rich in antioxidants, which are good for health. So it probably reduces cancer risk, not increases it.

Now, let's think again. The question is asking which factor increases the risk. From what I remember, smoking is the top cause, but since that's not an option here, other factors include things like radon, air pollution, and maybe certain supplements.

Beta-carotene supplements, when taken in high doses, have been linked to an increased risk of lung cancer in some studies, particularly in smokers. So option I is looking likely.

Alcohol (D) is a risk factor, but I'm not sure if it's as directly linked as beta-carotene supplements. Obesity (H) is also a factor, but again, maybe not the best fit compared to I.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be I: High dose ß-carotene supplements.

The correct answer is I: High dose ß-carotene supplements.
