Question:

Explain how the planarian changes its body shape.

Options:

A: By extending and retracting spines along its body
B: Through the use of cilia on its underside for movement and shape alteration
C: By secreting a mucus layer to change body contours
D: By absorbing water and expanding
E: By coordinated contraction and relaxation of circular, longitudinal, and dorsoventral muscles, the body shape of a planarian can be varied.
F: By shifting the distribution of body fluids to different segments
G: By changing the thickness of its skin
H: By rapid cell division and growth in specific body regions
I: By inflating air sacs within its body
J: By altering its genetic structure

Okay, so I need to figure out how planarians change their body shape. I remember that planarians are flatworms, right? They're known for their regenerative abilities, but I'm not sure about their body shape mechanisms. Let me think through the options.

Option A says they extend and retract spines. I don't recall planarians having spines. They have cilia, which are tiny hair-like structures, but spines don't sound right. Maybe that's for another animal, like a porcupinefish or something.

Option B mentions cilia on the underside. I know planarians use their cilia for movement, kind of like how they create a current to propel themselves. But does that help them change shape? Maybe, but I'm not sure if it's the main way they alter their body.

Option C is about secreting mucus. Some worms do that, but I don't remember planarians using mucus to change their shape. They might use it for lubrication or protection, but not shape alteration.

Option D suggests absorbing water to expand. That makes me think of jellyfish or something that's gelatinous, but planarians are more solid-bodied. Maybe earthworms can change shape by water absorption, but planarians probably don't do that.

Option E talks about muscles. I think planarians have muscles. They have circular, longitudinal, and maybe other muscle layers. If these muscles contract and relax, they can change their body shape. That sounds plausible because muscles are usually involved in movement and shape changes.

Option F is about shifting body fluids. I'm not sure. Some animals do redistribute fluids to change shape, like how frogs can inflate themselves. But planarians might not rely on that method. It seems less likely than muscle contraction.

Option G is changing skin thickness. That doesn't seem right. The skin is part of the epidermis, and I don't think changing its thickness is a primary method for altering body shape.

Option H involves rapid cell division. Cell division is for growth and regeneration, not immediate shape changes. Planarians can regrow parts, but that's not how they change shape quickly.

Option I mentions inflating air sacs. I don't think planarians have air sacs. That's more like something for birds or certain insects. Probably not relevant here.

Option J is altering genetic structure. That's way too broad and doesn't make sense in this context. It's about how they change shape, not their genetics.

So, putting it together. Planarians likely use their muscles to change shape. They have different muscle layers, and by contracting and relaxing these, they can alter their body shape. So option E seems correct.

The planarian changes its body shape primarily through the coordinated contraction and relaxation of its circular, longitudinal, and dorsoventral muscles. This allows it to alter its body shape effectively.
