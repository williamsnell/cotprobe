Question:

 Thomson discusses a different version of the violinist case wherein the violinist only needs to use your kidneys for one hour to survive. Her own view about this case is that

Options:

A: because the violinist's life is in danger, you have an absolute moral obligation to let them use your kidneys, regardless of the duration.
B: you have no obligation to let the violinist use your kidneys, but if you choose to do so, the violinist has the right to use them for that hour.
C: you have the right to disconnect the violinist at any point, regardless of the consequences for the violinist.
D: because you ought to let the violinist use your kidneys for that hour, we should conclude that he or she has a right to use your kidneys for that hour.
E: even though you ought to let the violinist use your kidneys for that hour, we should not conclude that he or she has a right to use your kidneys for that hour.
F: you have no obligation to let the violinist use your kidneys for that hour.
G: you have an obligation to let the violinist use your kidneys for that hour, but the violinist does not have a right to use your kidneys.
H: the violinist has an obligation to disconnect him- or herself before that hour is over.
I: you have an obligation to let the violinist use your kidneys for that hour, and the violinist also has a right to use your kidneys.

Okay, so I have this question about the violinist case that's a bit different from the usual scenario. I remember that the original violinist case is a thought experiment by Judith Jarvis Thomson. In the standard version, the violinist is connected to your body for nine months, and Thomson argues that even though you have a moral obligation to let the violinist survive, it doesn't create a right for the violinist to use your body indefinitely.

Now, in this question, the situation is a bit different. The violinist only needs your kidneys for one hour to survive. So I'm trying to recall what Thomson's view is on this modified scenario. I think she might have discussed it in her work, maybe as a variation to explore the boundaries of rights and obligations.

In the original case, Thomson's main argument is about the difference between having an obligation and having a right. She says that even though you're obligated to let the violinist live, the violinist doesn't thereby have a right to your body. So in the original case, the obligation exists, but no right is conferred.

If the scenario changes to just one hour, does Thomson change her view? I don't think so. The key point for her is the duration and the implications for bodily autonomy. The longer the time, the more it might seem like a right, but even for a shorter period, the obligation doesn't automatically translate into a right.

Looking at the options:

Option A says you have an absolute moral obligation regardless of duration. That might align with the idea of saving a life, but Thomson's point is more about rights, so this might not capture her view.

Option B says no obligation, but you can choose to let them use it, granting the violinist a right if you do. That seems off because Thomson argues there is an obligation, not just a choice.

Option C talks about disconnecting at any point. That's more about the right to terminate, which isn't directly about the obligation or right in this question.

Option D suggests that because you should let them use it for an hour, they have a right. That seems to conflate obligation with right, which Thomson would argue against.

Option E says you ought to let them use it but they don't have a right. This seems to align with Thomson's position because she would say there's an obligation to help but no right arises.

Option F says no obligation, which contradicts Thomson's view that there's at least an obligation to save the violinist.

Option G states an obligation exists but no right. That's exactly what Thomson argues in the original case, so it should apply here too.

Option H suggests the violinist has an obligation to disconnect, which doesn't fit because the question is about your obligations, not theirs.

Option I says both obligation and right exist, which again goes against Thomson's stance.

So, considering all this, the correct answer should be either E or G. Wait, in the original case, G would be correct because it says you have an obligation but they don't have a right. In this modified case, since the duration is shorter, does that change anything? I don't think so. Thomson's argument isn't about the duration but about the principle that an obligation doesn't create a right. So even for one hour, you have an obligation but no right. Therefore, the correct answer is G.

The correct answer is G: you have an obligation to let the violinist use your kidneys for that hour, but the violinist does not have a right to use your kidneys. This aligns with Thomson's view that even though there is a moral obligation to save the violinist, it does not confer a right to use your body.

Answer: G
