Question:

7.1-3. To determine the effect of $100 \%$ nitrate on the growth of pea plants, several specimens were planted and then watered with $100 \%$ nitrate every day. At the end of
two weeks, the plants were measured. Here are data on seven of them:
$$
\begin{array}{lllllll}
17.5 & 14.5 & 15.2 & 14.0 & 17.3 & 18.0 & 13.8
\end{array}
$$
Assume that these data are a random sample from a normal distribution $N\left(\mu, \sigma^2\right)$.
(a) Find the value of a point estimate of $\mu$.


Options:

A: $14.857$
B: $16.875$
C: $16.231$
D: $15.471$
E: $15.000$
F: $17.142$
G: $14.328$
H: $18.357$
I: $17.512$
J:  $15.757$

Okay, so I have this statistics problem in front of me. It's about estimating the mean of a normal distribution using a sample of data. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that seven pea plants were watered with 100% nitrate, and their growth measurements after two weeks are given. The data points are: 17.5, 14.5, 15.2, 14.0, 17.3, 18.0, and 13.8. I'm supposed to find a point estimate of the population mean μ. The options are labeled from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Alright, so first, I remember that a point estimate is a single value used to estimate a population parameter. For the mean, the most common point estimate is the sample mean. So I think I need to calculate the average of these seven measurements.

Let me list the numbers again to make sure I have them right: 17.5, 14.5, 15.2, 14.0, 17.3, 18.0, 13.8. There are seven numbers here, so I'll add them all up and then divide by 7.

Let me add them step by step. Starting with 17.5 and 14.5: 17.5 + 14.5 = 32.0. Then adding 15.2 gives 32.0 + 15.2 = 47.2. Next, adding 14.0: 47.2 + 14.0 = 61.2. Then adding 17.3: 61.2 + 17.3 = 78.5. Adding 18.0 next: 78.5 + 18.0 = 96.5. Finally, adding 13.8: 96.5 + 13.8 = 110.3.

So the total sum is 110.3. Now, I divide this by the number of samples, which is 7. Let me do that calculation: 110.3 ÷ 7. Hmm, 7 goes into 110.3 how many times? 

Well, 7 times 15 is 105. Subtracting 105 from 110.3 leaves 5.3. Then, 5.3 divided by 7 is approximately 0.757. So adding that to 15 gives 15.757. 

Wait, but let me double-check that division to be sure. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

Let me write it out:

110.3 ÷ 7.

7 × 15 = 105. So 15 times, remainder 5.3.

5.3 ÷ 7 = 0.757142... So the sample mean is approximately 15.757.

Looking at the options, option J is 15.757. So that must be the correct answer.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in adding the numbers. Let me add them again:

17.5 + 14.5 = 32.0

32.0 +15.2 = 47.2

47.2 +14.0 = 61.2

61.2 +17.3 = 78.5

78.5 +18.0 = 96.5

96.5 +13.8 = 110.3. Yep, that's correct.

So the sum is indeed 110.3, and divided by 7 is approximately 15.757. So the point estimate for μ is 15.757, which is option J.
</think>

The point estimate of μ is the sample mean, calculated by summing all the data points and dividing by the number of samples. The sum of the data is 110.3, and dividing by 7 gives approximately 15.757. 

Answer: J
