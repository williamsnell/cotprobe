Okay, so I have this biology question to answer, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about how different animals obtain oxygen—earthworms, frogs, fish, and humans. I remember that respiration varies among these creatures because they live in different environments.

First, let's start with the earthworm. I think earthworms live in the soil, right? They don't have lungs; instead, I recall that they breathe through their skin. Their skin is moist, which helps in the diffusion of oxygen from the environment into their bloodstream. So earthworms use their skin for respiration.

Next, frogs. Frogs are amphibians, so they live both in water and on land. When they're in water, I think they use gills, but once they're on land, they can use their lungs. Wait, no, actually, I think frogs can breathe through their skin too. Oh wait, do they use both gills and lungs? Or maybe just their skin and lungs? I'm a bit unsure. Let me think again. Frogs in the water as larvae use gills, but as adults, they live on land and water. They have lungs for air breathing and their skin assists in respiration by absorbing oxygen from the air or water. So frogs use both their skin and lungs for oxygen, I think.

Then, fish. Fish live in water, so they have gills to extract oxygen from the water. They take water into their mouths and pass it over their gills, where oxygen is absorbed into their bloodstream. So fish definitely use gills.

Lastly, humans. We have lungs, right? We breathe in air, and the lungs take oxygen from the air into the bloodstream. So humans use lungs.

Now, looking at the options:

Option H says: Earthworms respire through their skin, frogs use their skin and lungs, fish use gills, and humans use lungs. That fits what I was thinking. Earthworms use skin, frogs use both skin and lungs, fish use gills, humans use lungs.

Let me check other options to make sure. Option A says earthworms use gills, which I know they don't. Option B says earthworms and humans use lungs, but earthworms don't have lungs. Option C says all use gills, which is wrong because earthworms and humans don't. Option D says earthworms and humans use gills—again, humans have lungs. Option E says earthworms use lungs, which is incorrect. Option F says earthworms and fish use skin, but fish use gills. Option G says earthworms use skin and lungs, which is wrong. Option I says earthworms use gills, which is wrong. So H must be the correct answer.

The correct answer is H: Earthworms respire through their skin, frogs use their skin and lungs, fish use gills, and humans use lungs.

Answer: H
