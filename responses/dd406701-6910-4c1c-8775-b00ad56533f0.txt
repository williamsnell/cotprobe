Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a DC-6 propeller blade. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the blade is 2 meters long and has a mass of 50 kg. They treat it as a uniform rigid rod, which probably means the mass is evenly distributed along its length. The blade is rotated about one end at 2200 revolutions per minute (rpm), and I need to find the outward force it exerts on the socket holding it. 

Wait, so the propeller is spinning, and because of its rotation, it must be experiencing some kind of force. I remember that when a rigid body rotates, especially when there's a change in its rotation, like speeding up or slowing down, there are forces involved. But wait, in this case, the blade is rotating at a constant speed, right? So maybe it's about centripetal force or something else.

Wait, but the question is about the outward force. Centripetal force is the inward force required for circular motion, so the outward force would be the reaction to that. Oh right, Newton's third law. So the blade exerts a force outward on the socket, and the socket exerts an equal and opposite inward force on the blade. So the force we're looking for is the reaction force.

But how do I calculate it? Let me think. The blade is rotating, so each point on the blade is moving in a circle. The tip of the blade is moving in a circle of radius equal to the length of the blade, which is 2 meters. So the centripetal acceleration at the tip is a = v² / r, but wait, since it's rotating, another formula might be better. Oh right, a = ω² r, where ω is the angular velocity in radians per second.

So I need to convert the rotational speed from rpm to rad/s. 2200 rpm. Since one revolution is 2π radians, then ω = 2200 * 2π / 60. Let me calculate that. 2200 divided by 60 is, let's see, 2200/60 = 36.666... So ω = 36.666... * 2π. That's approximately 36.666 * 6.283, which is roughly 229.3 radians per second.

Wait, let me check that calculation again. 2200 rpm: 2200 times (2π) divided by 60. So 2200 * 2 = 4400, times π is about 4400 * 3.1416 ≈ 13823. Then divide by 60: 13823 / 60 ≈ 230.383 rad/s. So approximately 230.38 rad/s.

Now, the centripetal acceleration at the tip is a = ω² r. So ω squared is (230.38)^2. Let me compute that. 230^2 is 52900, and 0.38^2 is about 0.1444, but since it's 230.38, the square is roughly (230 + 0.38)^2 = 230^2 + 2*230*0.38 + 0.38^2. So 52900 + 174.8 + 0.1444 ≈ 53074.94 rad²/s². Multiply by r, which is 2 meters: 53074.94 * 2 ≈ 106149.88 m/s².

Wait, that's the centripetal acceleration at the tip. But how does that translate into force? Oh, wait, the force we're looking for is the centrifugal force, which is the outward force. But centrifugal force is a pseudo-force in the rotating frame, so in the inertial frame, it's the centripetal force that's real. The force the blade exerts on the socket is the reaction to the centripetal force the blade is experiencing.

Wait, so the blade's mass is 50 kg, so the force F would be mass times centripetal acceleration. So F = m * a = 50 kg * 106149.88 m/s². Wait, that's a huge number. Let me compute that: 50 * 106149.88 ≈ 5,307,494 N. That's over 5 million Newtons, which seems way too high. But wait, the options don't go that high; the highest is E: 4.65e6 N. So maybe I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, let me double-check. Oh, wait! No, wait, the centripetal acceleration a is ω² * r. So I think I messed up the calculation. Let me recompute ω first.

2200 rpm: 2200 * 2π / 60. Let me compute 2200 * 2 = 4400. 4400 / 60 is 73.333... π is about 3.1416, so 73.333 * 3.1416 ≈ 230.38 rad/s. So that's correct. Then ω squared is (230.38)^2. Let me calculate that more accurately. 230.38 squared: 230^2 is 52900. 0.38^2 is 0.1444. Then cross terms: 2*230*0.38 = 2*230 is 460 * 0.38 = 174.8. So total is 52900 + 174.8 + 0.1444 ≈ 53074.944 rad²/s².

Multiply by r=2: 53074.944 * 2 = 106,149.888 m/s². Then F = m*a = 50 kg * 106,149.888 ≈ 5,307,494.4 N. That's about 5.3e6 N, but the options don't have that. The highest is E: 4.65e6. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I confused the formula. Let me think again. The formula for centripetal force is F = m * ω² r. So F = 50 kg * (2200 rpm converted to rad/s)^2 * 2 m. Let me recalculate ω in rad/s properly.

Wait, 2200 rpm is 2200 revolutions per minute. To convert to rad/s: 2200 * 2π / 60. Let me compute that exactly. 2200 * 2 = 4400. 4400 / 60 = 73.3333... So 73.3333 * π. Let's compute 73.3333 * 3.14159265 ≈ 73.3333 * 3.1416 ≈ 230.3776 rad/s. So ω is 230.3776 rad/s.

Now, ω squared is (230.3776)^2. Let me compute this more accurately. 230^2 is 52900, 0.3776^2 is about 0.1425, and the cross term is 2*230*0.3776 = 230 * 0.7552 ≈ 173.7. So total is 52900 + 173.7 + 0.1425 ≈ 53073.84 m/s². Multiply by r=2: 53073.84 * 2 = 106,147.68 m/s². Then F = 50 kg * 106,147.68 ≈ 5,307,384 N. That's about 5.3e6 N, but the options don't have that. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I messed up the units. Let me check again. Oh wait, maybe I should have used angular velocity in radians per second correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the formula F = (m * v²) / r, but v is the tangential velocity. Let me try that approach.

The tangential velocity v at the tip is v = ω * r. So ω is 230.3776 rad/s, and r is 2 m. So v = 230.3776 * 2 ≈ 460.755 m/s. Then v squared is (460.755)^2 ≈ 460^2 is 211,600, plus 0.755^2 which is about 0.57, and cross terms 2*460*0.755 = 460 * 1.51 ≈ 694.6. So total v² ≈ 211,600 + 694.6 + 0.57 ≈ 212,295.17 m²/s².

Then F = m * v² / r = 50 kg * 212,295.17 / 2 m. Wait, that's 50 * (212,295.17 / 2) = 50 * 106,147.585 ≈ 5,307,379 N. Again, about 5.3e6 N. Hmm, but the options don't go that high. The highest is E: 4.65e6. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe the problem isn't asking for the force due to rotation, but something else. Oh wait, the question says "what outward force does it exert on the socket". So perhaps it's the force on the socket, which is the reaction to the centripetal force the blade is experiencing. So F = m * a, where a is the centripetal acceleration at the center of mass of the blade.

Wait, no, wait. The blade is a uniform rod, so its center of mass is at the midpoint, which is 1 meter from the axis (since the length is 2 meters). So maybe I should calculate the centripetal acceleration at the center of mass, not at the tip. Oh wait, that's a crucial mistake I made earlier. I was calculating at the tip, but the center of mass is at 1 meter. So the centripetal acceleration at the center is a = ω² * (L/2), where L is 2 meters, so a = ω² * 1 m.

Ah, that's where I went wrong. I should have used the center of mass's acceleration, not the tip's. So let's recalculate.

ω is 230.3776 rad/s. So a = (230.3776)^2 * 1 = 53074.94 m/s². Then F = m * a = 50 kg * 53074.94 ≈ 2,653,747 N. Oh, that's about 2.65e6 N, which matches option B: 2.65 × 10^6 N.

Wait, but wait a minute. The problem says the blade is rotated about one end. So the center of mass is at L/2 from the axis, so the radius used in the centripetal acceleration is L/2, not L. So that's correct. So the force is 2.65e6 N, which is option B.

The problem involves calculating the outward force exerted by a DC-6 propeller blade on its socket due to rotation. The blade is treated as a uniform rigid rod with a length of 2 m and a mass of 50 kg, rotating at 2200 rpm about one end. 

To solve this, we first convert the rotational speed from rpm to radians per second (rad/s). Using the formula:

\[
\omega = \frac{2200 \times 2\pi}{60} \approx 230.38 \, \text{rad/s}.
\]

Next, we calculate the centripetal acceleration at the center of mass of the blade. Since the blade is uniform, its center of mass is located at \( L/2 = 1 \, \text{m} \) from the axis of rotation. The centripetal acceleration is given by:

\[
a = \omega^2 r = (230.38)^2 \times 1 \approx 53074.94 \, \text{m/s}^2.
\]

The outward force exerted by the blade on the socket is the reaction to the centripetal force. Using Newton's second law, the force is:

\[
F = m \cdot a = 50 \, \text{kg} \times 53074.94 \, \text{m/s}^2 \approx 2.65 \times 10^6 \, \text{N}.
\]

Thus, the outward force is approximately \( 2.65 \times 10^6 \, \text{N} \), which corresponds to option **B**.
