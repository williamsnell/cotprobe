Okay, so I have this problem here about the order of an element in the group Z_12 x Z_8. The element given is (4, 2), and I need to find its order. The options are from A to J, with numbers like 2, 9, 4, 5, etc. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in group theory, the order of an element in a direct product of groups is the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of its components in each group. So, for Z_m x Z_n, the order of (a, b) is LCM(order of a in Z_m, order of b in Z_n).

So, I need to find the order of 4 in Z_12 and the order of 2 in Z_8, then take their LCM.

Let me start with Z_12. The order of an element a in Z_n is the smallest positive integer k such that k*a is congruent to 0 mod n. So for 4 in Z_12, I'm looking for the smallest k where 4k ≡ 0 mod 12.

Let's compute that. 4k mod 12: when is this zero? Let's try k=1: 4*1=4 mod12≠0. k=2: 8≠0. k=3:12≡0. So the order of 4 in Z_12 is 3.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, that's not right. Because 4*3=12, which is 0 mod12. So yes, the order is 3. But wait, wait a second. Wait, Z_12 has elements where the order is given by 12 divided by the gcd of a and 12. Oh right, the formula is order(a) = n / gcd(a, n).

So, for a=4 in Z_12, gcd(4,12)=4. So order is 12/4=3. Yep, that's correct. So order of 4 in Z_12 is 3.

Next, the order of 2 in Z_8. Similarly, using the same formula: order(b) = n / gcd(b, n). So for b=2 in Z_8, gcd(2,8)=2. So order is 8/2=4. So the order of 2 in Z_8 is 4.

Now, the order of the element (4,2) in Z_12 x Z_8 is the LCM of 3 and 4. Let's compute that. LCM(3,4) is 12, because 3 and 4 are coprime. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3 and 4 have LCM 12? Let me double-check. The multiples of 3 are 3,6,9,12,... and of 4 are 4,8,12,... so yes, the least common multiple is 12.

Wait, but wait a moment. Is that correct? Because sometimes when the groups have orders that are not coprime, the LCM could be different. But in this case, 3 and 4 are coprime, so their LCM is indeed 12.

So the order of (4,2) is 12. Looking at the options, G is 12. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. Maybe I confused the order in Z_12 and Z_8.

Wait, no. For Z_12, the order is 3, for Z_8 it's 4. Their LCM is 12. So the element (4,2) must have order 12. So the correct answer is G:12.

The order of the element (4, 2) in Z_12 x Z_8 is the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of 4 in Z_12 and 2 in Z_8. 

- The order of 4 in Z_12 is 3 because 4*3 ≡ 0 mod 12.
- The order of 2 in Z_8 is 4 because 2*4 ≡ 0 mod 8.

Thus, the LCM of 3 and 4 is 12. Therefore, the order of (4, 2) is 12.

Answer: G
