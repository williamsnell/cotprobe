Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the expansion coefficient of a liquid. Hmm, the expansion coefficient, alpha, right? I remember that alpha is related to how much the volume changes with temperature. Let me think.

The problem gives me an equation for the volume as a function of temperature. The equation is V = V' multiplied by a big expression. The expression is 0.75 plus some terms involving T over K. So, V' is the volume at 300 K, and I need to find alpha at 320 K.

Wait, what's the formula for the expansion coefficient? Oh right, alpha is (1/V) * (dV/dT) evaluated at a specific temperature. So I need to find the derivative of V with respect to T and then divide by V.

Looking at the given equation: V = V' [0.75 + 3.9e-4*(T/K) + 1.48e-6*(T/K)^2]. Since V' is the volume at 300 K, I guess when T is 300 K, the expression in the brackets should be 1, right? Let me check: 0.75 plus 3.9e-4*300 plus 1.48e-6*(300)^2. Let me compute that.

3.9e-4 times 300 is 0.117. 1.48e-6 times 90000 (since 300^2 is 90000) is 1.48e-6 * 9e4 = 0.01332. So adding up: 0.75 + 0.117 = 0.867, plus 0.01332 is about 0.88032. Wait, that's not 1. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Oh, wait, maybe V' is defined such that at 300 K, the volume is V', so when T=300, the bracket equals 1? Because otherwise, V would be V' times something else, which might complicate things. Maybe I should proceed without worrying about that for now.

So, I need to find dV/dT. Let's take the derivative of V with respect to T. Since V' is a constant (because it's the volume at a specific temperature, 300 K), I can factor that out. So dV/dT = V' * derivative of [0.75 + 3.9e-4*(T) + 1.48e-6*(T)^2] with respect to T.

The derivative of 0.75 is zero. The derivative of 3.9e-4*T is 3.9e-4. The derivative of 1.48e-6*T^2 is 2*1.48e-6*T, which is 2.96e-6*T. So putting it together, dV/dT = V' [3.9e-4 + 2.96e-6*T].

Now, I need to evaluate this at T=320 K. So substitute T=320 into the expression. Let's compute 2.96e-6 * 320. 2.96e-6 is the same as 0.00000296. Multiply by 320: 0.00000296 * 320 = 0.0009472.

So dV/dT at 320 K is V' * (3.9e-4 + 0.0009472). Let's compute 3.9e-4, which is 0.00039. Adding 0.00039 + 0.0009472 gives 0.0013372.

So dV/dT = V' * 0.0013372. Now, the expansion coefficient alpha is (1/V) * (dV/dT). At T=320 K, V is V' multiplied by the bracket expression evaluated at 320 K.

Let me compute the bracket at T=320. So 0.75 + 3.9e-4*(320) + 1.48e-6*(320)^2.

First term: 0.75.

Second term: 3.9e-4 * 320. 3.9e-4 is 0.00039. 0.00039 *320 = 0.1248.

Third term: 1.48e-6 * (320)^2. 320 squared is 102400. 1.48e-6 * 102400 = 1.48 * 102400 * 1e-6. Let's compute 1.48 * 102400 = let's see, 100,000 *1.48 is 148,000, 2400*1.48=3552. So total 148,000 +3,552 =151,552. Multiply by 1e-6: 0.151552.

So adding all three terms: 0.75 + 0.1248 = 0.8748. Plus 0.151552 gives 1.026352.

So V at 320 K is V' * 1.026352.

Now, alpha = (1/V) * (dV/dT) = [1/(V' * 1.026352)] * (V' * 0.0013372). The V' cancels out. So alpha = 0.0013372 / 1.026352.

Let me compute that. 0.0013372 divided by 1.026352. Let's see: 0.0013372 / 1.026352 ≈ 0.001303. Wait, let me check.

Alternatively, perhaps 1.026352 is approximately 1.02635. So 0.0013372 / 1.02635. Let me compute this division.

Well, 1.02635 times 0.0013 is approximately 0.001334 (since 1.02635 * 0.0013 = 0.001334). Wait, but 0.0013372 is slightly higher than that. So perhaps the result is approximately 0.001303.

Wait, let me do it more accurately. Let me compute 0.0013372 / 1.026352.

Dividing 0.0013372 by 1.026352.

Let me write it as 1337.2e-6 / 1.026352. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 1337.2 / 1026.352 ≈ 1.303. So 1.303e-3, which is 1.303 ×10^-3 per K.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me do it precisely.

Compute 0.0013372 divided by 1.026352.

Let me approximate it step by step.

1.026352 * 0.0013 = 0.0013342576.

But 0.0013372 is a bit higher. So the difference is 0.0013372 - 0.0013342576 = 0.0000029424.

So how much more do I need to add to 0.0013 to get the remaining 0.0000029424.

So 1.026352 * x = 0.0000029424 → x = 0.0000029424 / 1.026352 ≈ 2.866e-6.

So the total is approximately 0.0013 + 0.000002866 ≈ 0.001302866, which is approximately 1.302866e-3.

Looking at the options, option E is 1.33e-3, D is 1.31e-3, I is 1.38e-3, H is 1.22e-3, etc. Wait, the options are:

A:1.50e-3

B:1.19e-3

C:1.15e-3

D:1.31e-3

E:1.33e-3

F:1.05e-3

G:1.27e-3

H:1.22e-3

I:1.38e-3

J:1.45e-3

So the value I calculated is approximately 1.303e-3, which is 1.303 ×10^-3. Looking at the options, D is 1.31e-3, which is very close. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the expansion.

Wait, let me recompute the derivative.

The volume is V = V' [0.75 + 3.9e-4 * T + 1.48e-6 * T²], where T is in Kelvin.

dV/dT = V' [ 3.9e-4 + 2*1.48e-6 * T ]

Ah, wait a minute! I think I made a mistake here. The derivative of T² is 2T, so the term should be 2*(1.48e-6)*T, which is 2.96e-6 T. So that part was correct.

Wait, but when I calculated dV/dT at 320 K, I added 3.9e-4 and 2.96e-6 *320, which is 0.00039 + 0.0009472 = 0.0013372. That’s correct.

Then, V at 320 K is V' multiplied by [0.75 + 3.9e-4*320 + 1.48e-6*(320)^2 ].

Let me recheck that computation.

0.75 + (3.9e-4)*320 + (1.48e-6)*(320^2).

Compute each term:

3.9e-4 * 320 = 0.00039 *320 = 0.1248.

1.48e-6 * 320^2 = 1.48e-6 * 102400 = 1.48 * 102400 = let's compute that again.

1.48 * 100,000 = 148,000.

1.48 * 2400 = 3,552. So total 148,000 + 3,552 = 151,552.

Multiply by 1e-6: 151,552 *1e-6 = 0.151552.

So adding all three terms:

0.75 + 0.1248 = 0.8748.

0.8748 + 0.151552 = 1.026352. Correct.

So V = V' * 1.026352.

Now, alpha = (dV/dT) / V = [V' * 0.0013372 ] / [ V' * 1.026352 ] = 0.0013372 / 1.026352.

Calculate this division:

0.0013372 ÷ 1.026352 ≈ ?

Let me compute this more accurately.

Let me set it up as 0.0013372 / 1.026352.

I can write it as 1337.2e-6 / 1.026352 = (1337.2 / 1.026352) * 1e-6.

Compute 1337.2 ÷ 1.026352.

Hmm, 1.026352 * 1300 = 1.026352 *1300 = 1334.2576.

So 1300 *1.026352 = 1334.2576.

Our numerator is 1337.2, which is 1337.2 - 1334.2576 = 2.9424 higher.

So 2.9424 ÷ 1.026352 ≈ 2.866.

So the total is approximately 1300 + 2.866 = 1302.866.

So 1302.866 *1e-6 = 0.001302866, which is 1.302866e-3.

Which is approximately 1.303e-3.

Looking at the options, D is 1.31e-3, which is very close. So I think D is the correct answer.

Wait, but why does the expansion coefficient depend on temperature? Oh, because the formula for V includes higher-order terms, so the expansion isn't linear. So the coefficient changes with temperature, which makes sense.

So the answer should be D: 1.31 ×10^-3 K^{-1}.
</think>

To calculate the expansion coefficient, $\alpha$, at $320 \mathrm{~K}$, we start with the given volume equation:

$$
V = V' \left\{0.75 + 3.9 \times 10^{-4}(T / \mathrm{K}) + 1.48 \times 10^{-6}(T / \mathrm{K})^2\right\}.
$$

The expansion coefficient is defined as:

$$
\alpha = \frac{1}{V} \left(\frac{dV}{dT}\right).
$$

### Step 1: Compute $\frac{dV}{dT}$
Taking the derivative of $V$ with respect to $T$:

$$
\frac{dV}{dT} = V' \left\{3.9 \times 10^{-4} + 2 \times 1.48 \times 10^{-6} T\right\}.
$$

Simplifying:

$$
\frac{dV}{dT} = V' \left\{3.9 \times 10^{-4} + 2.96 \times 10^{-6} T\right\}.
$$

At $T = 320 \mathrm{~K}$:

$$
\frac{dV}{dT} = V' \left\{3.9 \times 10^{-4} + 2.96 \times 10^{-6} \times 320\right\}.
$$

Compute $2.96 \times 10^{-6} \times 320$:

$$
2.96 \times 10^{-6} \times 320 = 0.0009472.
$$

Adding to $3.9 \times 10^{-4}$:

$$
3.9 \times 10^{-4} + 0.0009472 = 0.0013372.
$$

Thus:

$$
\frac{dV}{dT} = V' \times 0.0013372.
$$

### Step 2: Compute $V$ at $T = 320 \mathrm{~K}$
Substitute $T = 320 \mathrm{~K}$ into the volume equation:

$$
V = V' \left\{0.75 + 3.9 \times 10^{-4} \times 320 + 1.48 \times 10^{-6} \times (320)^2\right\}.
$$

Compute each term:

1. **First term**: $0.75$.
2. **Second term**: $3.9 \times 10^{-4} \times 320 = 0.1248$.
3. **Third term**: $1.48 \times 10^{-6} \times 102400 = 0.151552$.

Adding these:

$$
V = V' \left\{0.75 + 0.1248 + 0.151552\right\} = V' \times 1.026352.
$$

### Step 3: Compute $\alpha$
Using $\alpha = \frac{1}{V} \left(\frac{dV}{dT}\right)$:

$$
\alpha = \frac{1}{V' \times 1.026352} \times (V' \times 0.0013372).
$$

Cancel $V'$:

$$
\alpha = \frac{0.0013372}{1.026352}.
$$

Compute the division:

$$
\alpha \approx 1.303 \times 10^{-3} \, \mathrm{K}^{-1}.
$$

### Step 4: Match with Options
The closest option to $1.303 \times 10^{-3}$ is **D: $1.31 \times 10^{-3} \, \mathrm{K}^{-1}$**.

**Answer: D**
