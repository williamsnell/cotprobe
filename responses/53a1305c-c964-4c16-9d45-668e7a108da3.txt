Okay, so I've got this question here about what measure would best determine the likelihood that employees will stay on the job for a long time. The options are A through J. Let me think about each one.

The question is asking about something that predicts long-term employment. So, I need to find which factor is most associated with employee retention. Let's go through the options one by one.

Option A: Job productivity. That's about how much work an employee does. While productivity is important for the company, I'm not sure it directly relates to how long someone stays. A productive employee could leave for another job, so maybe not the best measure for retention.

Option B: Salary. Salary is a key factor in job satisfaction, right? People generally stay in jobs where they earn what they need or want. But is salary the most direct measure for retention? Maybe, but I'm not certain yet. Let me think more.

Option C: Motivation. Motivation does affect how engaged an employee is, which can influence staying. But motivation can vary, and it's a bit abstract. It's not a direct measure like job satisfaction.

Option D: Previous employment history. That could indicate if someone has a history of staying in jobs or switching often. But this is more about their past behavior rather than a current measure. The question is asking for a measure to determine their likelihood now, so maybe not as useful as something current.

Option E: Age. Age might correlate with experience, but not necessarily with staying in a job. Younger employees might change jobs more, but that's a generalization. It's not a direct measure.

Option F: Ambition. Ambitious people might seek higher positions elsewhere, so having ambition could actually lead to higher turnover. So maybe not the best indicator for staying long.

Option G: Job satisfaction. This seems directly related. If an employee is satisfied with their job, they are more likely to stay. Job satisfaction measures their contentment, which is a strong indicator of retention. This feels like the right answer, but let me check the others.

Option H: Educational background. Education might affect job performance and opportunities, but it doesn't directly measure the likelihood of staying. Two people with the same education can have different retention rates.

Option I: Physical health. Health issues could affect job performance, but it's more about their ability to work rather than their desire to stay. Unless health issues force someone to leave, but that's not the same as measuring retention likelihood.

Option J: Intelligence. While intelligence can help in job performance, it doesn't directly relate to how long someone stays. Smart people can leave for various reasons, so it's not the best measure.

So, putting it all together, the most useful measure would be job satisfaction because it directly relates to how content an employee is, which in turn affects their likelihood to stay with the company long-term. Other options like salary and motivation are related but job satisfaction is more direct.

The measure that would be most useful for determining the likelihood that employees will remain on the job for a long period of time is **G: job satisfaction**. Job satisfaction directly relates to an employee's contentment and engagement, which are strong predictors of retention. Other factors like salary and motivation are related but are not as direct as job satisfaction in measuring retention.

Answer: G
