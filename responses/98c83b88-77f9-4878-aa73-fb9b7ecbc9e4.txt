<think>
Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here about an air-vapor mixture. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The problem says the mixture is initially at 60°F and 55% relative humidity. Then it's heated until it reaches 85°F. The pressure is 14.7 psia, which I think is standard atmospheric pressure, so maybe I can use standard tables for this.

The question has three parts: (a) initial and final specific humidities, (b) final relative humidity, and (c) the heat added per lbm of dry air. The options are from A to J, each giving different values.

First, I need to find the initial specific humidity. Specific humidity is the mass of water vapor per unit mass of dry air. I remember that the specific humidity can be found using the relative humidity and the saturation specific humidity at the given temperature.

So, at the initial temperature of 60°F, I need to find the saturation specific humidity, then multiply by the relative humidity (0.55) to get the actual specific humidity.

I think I can use the psychrometric chart or maybe the tables from the appendix of my textbook. Wait, since I don't have the chart here, I'll try to recall some values. Alternatively, I can think about the formula for specific humidity.

Wait, the formula for specific humidity (w) is w = (0.622 * P_vapor) / (P - P_vapor). But since the pressure is 14.7 psia, and at saturation, P_vapor is the vapor pressure at 60°F.

I think the vapor pressure at 60°F is around 0.231 psi. Let me check that. Oh, right, from standard tables, at 60°F, the saturation vapor pressure is about 0.231 psi.

So, initial specific humidity w_initial = 0.622 * (0.231) / (14.7 - 0.231). Let me compute that.

First, 14.7 - 0.231 = 14.469 psia. Then 0.622 * 0.231 = approximately 0.1439. So, 0.1439 / 14.469 ≈ 0.010 (wait, that's around 0.010, but wait, that seems high. Wait, 0.1439 divided by 14.469 is approximately 0.00994, which is about 0.00994 lbm H2O/lbm air. Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them have 0.00994. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the specific humidity at 60°F and 55% RH. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for specific humidity when RH is given.

The formula is w = (0.622 * P) / (P + 0.622 * x * P), where x is the specific humidity. Wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, I can think of w = (0.622 * P_vapor) / (P - P_vapor), where P_vapor is the actual vapor pressure at the given RH.

Since RH is 55%, P_vapor = 0.55 * P_sat at 60°F. P_sat at 60°F is 0.231 psi, so P_vapor = 0.55 * 0.231 ≈ 0.12705 psi.

Then, w_initial = (0.622 * 0.12705) / (14.7 - 0.12705) = (0.07901) / (14.573) ≈ 0.005425 lbm H2O/lbm air.

Wait, that's about 0.0054 lbm. But looking at the options, some have 0.00602, others 0.00702, etc. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait another approach: perhaps using the psychrometric formula. The specific humidity can also be found using the relation w = 0.622 * (h_g / (T + h_g)), where h_g is the enthalpy of vaporization at a certain temperature. But I'm not sure if that's easier.

Wait, perhaps I should just look for the specific humidity at 60°F and 55% RH. From standard tables, at 60°F, the saturation specific humidity is about 0.0100 lbm H2O/lbm air. So at 55% RH, it's 0.55 * 0.0100 ≈ 0.0055 lbm. So that would correspond to about 0.0055 lbm. Looking at the options, option C has initial specific humidity as 0.00602, which is a bit higher. Option J has initial 0.00502, which is lower. Wait, perhaps my initial approach was wrong because maybe the specific humidity at 60°F, 55% RH is actually higher?

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me recalculate.

w_initial = (0.622 * P_vapor) / (P - P_vapor)

Given P = 14.7 psia,

P_vapor = 0.55 * P_sat_60.

P_sat_60 is approximately 0.231 psi, so P_vapor = 0.55 * 0.231 ≈ 0.12705 psi.

So,

w_initial = (0.622 * 0.12705) / (14.7 - 0.12705)

Calculate numerator: 0.622 * 0.12705 ≈ 0.07902.

Denominator: 14.7 - 0.12705 = 14.57295.

So, w_initial ≈ 0.07902 / 14.57295 ≈ 0.005425 lbm/lbm.

Looking at the options, none of the initial specific humidities are exactly 0.005425. Let me check the options.

Option C: Initial 0.00602, final 0.00502. Hmm, that's increasing or decreasing? Wait, when you heat the air, does the specific humidity stay the same? Because specific humidity is the actual mass of water vapor in the air, so if you heat without adding or removing moisture, the specific humidity remains constant. So in this problem, since it's just heated, the specific humidity should remain the same. So both initial and final specific humidities should be the same, which is 0.005425 lbm/lbm.

Wait, but looking at the options, none have both initial and final as 0.005425. Option A says initial and final are 0.00802. Option G says initial and final are 0.00652. Option H says initial and final 0.00702. Option I: 0.00652.

But wait, maybe my initial calculation was wrong. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should use the saturated specific humidity at 60°F. Wait, I thought it was about 0.010 lbm, but maybe that's not correct. Let me think again.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for specific humidity when RH is given: w = (0.622 * P_vapor) / (P - P_vapor). But I might have messed up the values.

Wait, another approach: using the relation between specific humidity and relative humidity. The specific humidity w is related to the relative humidity φ by the equation w = (0.622 * φ * P_sat) / (P - φ * P_sat).

At 60°F, P_sat is 0.231 psi. So, w_initial = (0.622 * 0.55 * 0.231) / (14.7 - 0.55 * 0.231).

Calculating numerator: 0.622 * 0.55 = 0.3421. 0.3421 * 0.231 ≈ 0.0791.

Denominator: 14.7 - (0.55 * 0.231) = 14.7 - 0.12705 ≈ 14.57295.

So w_initial ≈ 0.0791 / 14.57295 ≈ 0.005425 lbm/lbm. So that's about 0.0054.

Now, looking at the options, none have both initial and final at 0.0054. So maybe I'm missing something. Wait, the problem states that the mixture is heated until it reaches 85°F. Since heating at constant pressure and without adding or removing water vapor, the specific humidity remains constant. So both initial and final specific humidities should be the same.

Looking at the options, options A, G, H, I have the same initial and final specific humidities. Let's see:

Option A: Initial and final: 0.00802. That's higher than our calculated 0.0054. So maybe I'm wrong.

Option G: 0.00652 each. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, maybe I should check specific humidity at 60°F and 55% RH. Let me think of standard values. I recall that at 60°F, the saturation specific humidity is about 0.0100 lbm H2O/lbm air. So 55% RH would be 0.0055 lbm. That aligns with our earlier calculation.

Looking at the options, none have initial and final at 0.0055. So perhaps the options are using a different table. Wait, maybe the specific humidity is given as 0.00602 lbm/lbm. Let me see which option has initial and final at 0.00602. Option B's initial is 0.00602, but the final is 0.00502, which would imply a drop, but since we're heating without adding or removing moisture, that shouldn't happen. So that's incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the initial specific humidity. Let me try another approach. Let me use the formula w = 0.622 * (h_g) / (T + h_g), where h_g is the enthalpy of vaporization at 60°F. Wait, but I don't remember h_g off the top of my head. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the relation that the specific humidity at saturation is approximately 0.0100 lbm/lbm at 60°F. So, 55% of that is 0.0055 lbm/lbm.

So, the initial specific humidity is 0.0055, and since it's constant, the final is also 0.0055.

But none of the options have this. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the options again.

Wait, looking at option C: initial 0.00602, final 0.00502. That would mean specific humidity decreased, which shouldn't happen when heating without adding or removing moisture. So that's unlikely. Similarly, option E has initial 0.00802 and final higher, which also doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the initial specific humidity is 0.00602. Let me see if that makes sense. So, if w_initial is 0.00602, then using the formula:

w = 0.622 * P_vapor / (P - P_vapor)

0.00602 = 0.622 * P_vapor / (14.7 - P_vapor)

Let me solve for P_vapor.

0.00602 * (14.7 - P_vapor) = 0.622 * P_vapor

Multiply out:

0.00602 *14.7 - 0.00602 P_vapor = 0.622 P_vapor

0.088374 = (0.622 + 0.00602) P_vapor

0.088374 = 0.62802 P_vapor

P_vapor = 0.088374 / 0.62802 ≈ 0.1407 psi.

Now, P_sat at 60°F is 0.231 psi, so RH would be (0.1407 / 0.231) * 100 ≈ 61%. But the problem states 55% RH, so this would not match. So option C's initial specific humidity of 0.00602 gives a higher RH than stated. So that's incorrect.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me try to find the initial specific humidity correctly.

Another approach: using the psychrometric ratio. The psychrometric ratio (ω) is the ratio of the molecular weight of water to the molecular weight of air, which is about 1.004. But maybe that's not directly helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for specific humidity in terms of temperature and relative humidity. Wait, I think the specific humidity can also be expressed as w = (0.622 * P * φ) / (P + 0.622 * P * φ).

Wait, let me plug in the numbers.

At 60°F, P = 14.7 psia, φ = 0.55.

w_initial = (0.622 * 14.7 * 0.55) / (14.7 + 0.622 * 14.7 * 0.55)

First, calculate numerator: 0.622 *14.7 ≈ 9.1314. 9.1314 * 0.55 ≈ 5.02227.

Denominator: 14.7 + (0.622 *14.7 *0.55) = 14.7 + 5.02227 ≈ 19.72227.

So w_initial ≈ 5.02227 / 19.72227 ≈ 0.2546 lbm H2O/lbm air. Wait, that's way too high. That can't be right because saturation specific humidity at 60°F is around 0.0100, so 0.25 would be impossible. I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, no, I think I messed up the formula. Let me correct that. The correct formula for specific humidity when using pressure and relative humidity is:

w = (0.622 * P * φ) / (P + 0.622 * P * φ)

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, the correct formula is:

w = (0.622 * P_vapor) / (P - P_vapor), where P_vapor = φ * P_sat.

So, P_vapor = 0.55 * 0.231 ≈ 0.12705 psi.

Thus,

w = (0.622 * 0.12705) / (14.7 - 0.12705) ≈ 0.07902 / 14.57295 ≈ 0.005425 lbm/lbm.

So, initial specific humidity is approximately 0.005425 lbm/lbm.

Now, looking at the options, none have initial and final as 0.005425. The closest is option J, which has initial 0.00502 and final 0.00602. But that would imply an increase in specific humidity upon heating, which shouldn't happen if no moisture is added. So that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. Let me see which options have the same initial and final specific humidity.

Options A, G, H, I have initial and final the same. So let's look at their values.

Option A: 0.00802. Would that fit?

If initial w is 0.00802, then P_vapor = (w * (P - P_vapor)) / 0.622.

Wait, let me set up the equation:

w = 0.622 P_vapor / (P - P_vapor)

0.00802 = 0.622 * P_vapor / (14.7 - P_vapor)

Multiply both sides by denominator:

0.00802 (14.7 - P_vapor) = 0.622 P_vapor

0.00802 *14.7 = 0.622 P_vapor + 0.00802 P_vapor

0.117394 = (0.622 + 0.00802) P_vapor ≈ 0.63002 P_vapor

P_vapor ≈ 0.117394 / 0.63002 ≈ 0.1863 psi.

Then, RH = (P_vapor / P_sat_60) * 100 = (0.1863 / 0.231) *100 ≈ 80.7%. But the problem states 55% RH, so this is wrong.

So option A's initial specific humidity is not correct for 55% RH at 60°F.

Option G: initial and final 0.00652.

Set w = 0.00652.

0.00652 = 0.622 P_vapor / (14.7 - P_vapor)

Multiply:

0.00652 (14.7 - P_vapor) = 0.622 P_vapor

0.095484 - 0.00652 P_vapor = 0.622 P_vapor

0.095484 = 0.62852 P_vapor

P_vapor ≈ 0.095484 / 0.62852 ≈ 0.1518 psi.

RH = 0.1518 / 0.231 ≈ 0.656, so 65.6%. But the problem states 55%, so option G is incorrect.

Option H: initial and final 0.00702.

w = 0.00702.

0.00702 = 0.622 P_vapor / (14.7 - P_vapor)

Multiply:

0.00702 (14.7 - P_vapor) = 0.622 P_vapor

0.102994 - 0.00702 P_vapor = 0.622 P_vapor

0.102994 = 0.62902 P_vapor

P_vapor ≈ 0.102994 / 0.62902 ≈ 0.1635 psi.

RH = 0.1635 / 0.231 ≈ 70.7%, which is higher than 55%, so option H is incorrect.

Option I: initial and final 0.00652.

Wait, same as option G. I think I already checked that.

Hmm, this is getting frustrating because none of the options seem to have the correct initial specific humidity based on my calculations. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the initial specific humidity. Let me check using the specific humidity formula again.

w = (0.622 * P_vapor) / (P - P_vapor)

P_vapor = 0.55 * P_sat_60.

P_sat at 60°F is 0.231 psi, so P_vapor = 0.55 * 0.231 ≈ 0.12705 psi.

So,

w = 0.622 * 0.12705 / (14.7 - 0.12705)

Numerator: 0.622 * 0.12705 ≈ 0.07902.

Denominator: 14.7 - 0.12705 ≈ 14.57295.

w ≈ 0.07902 / 14.57295 ≈ 0.005425 lbm/lbm.

So initial specific humidity is approximately 0.005425 lbm/lbm. None of the options have this. So maybe the correct answer isn't listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps I should use the specific humidity at 85°F. Wait, no, because the specific humidity remains constant upon heating without adding or removing moisture.

Wait, maybe I should look at the final relative humidity. Let's move to part (b). The final temperature is 85°F, and the specific humidity is still 0.005425 lbm/lbm.

So, the saturation vapor pressure at 85°F is higher than at 60°F. Let me check that. From tables, P_sat at 85°F is approximately 1.311 psi.

Now, the relative humidity φ_final is (P_vapor_final / P_sat_final) * 100.

But since the specific humidity w = 0.005425, and P = 14.7 psia, we can find P_vapor_final.

Using w = 0.622 P_vapor / (P - P_vapor)

0.005425 = 0.622 P_vapor / (14.7 - P_vapor)

Multiply both sides by denominator:

0.005425 (14.7 - P_vapor) = 0.622 P_vapor

0.005425 *14.7 ≈ 0.07952.

So,

0.07952 - 0.005425 P_vapor = 0.622 P_vapor

0.07952 = (0.622 + 0.005425) P_vapor ≈ 0.627425 P_vapor

P_vapor ≈ 0.07952 / 0.627425 ≈ 0.1267 psi.

Now, φ_final = (0.1267 / 1.311) *100 ≈ 9.66%.

Wait, that's much lower than any of the options. The options for part (b) range from 20.64% to 28.64%. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the final temperature's saturation pressure. Let me check again. From standard tables, at 85°F, P_sat is about 1.311 psi, so that's correct.

So, φ_final ≈ 9.66%, but none of the options have that. So perhaps my initial approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the process is adiabatic or something else? No, the problem states that heat is added, so it's just a simple heating process without changing moisture content.

Wait, maybe I should consider that when you heat air, the relative humidity decreases because the saturation vapor pressure increases. So, the specific humidity remains the same, but φ decreases.

In our calculation, φ_final is about 9.66%, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial specific humidity.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial specific humidity is higher. Let me check the options again. Option E has initial 0.00802 and final 0.00902. That would mean adding moisture, which the problem doesn't state, so that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct initial specific humidity is 0.00602 lbm/lbm. Let me compute what RH that would give at 60°F.

Using w = 0.622 P_vapor / (P - P_vapor) = 0.00602.

So,

0.00602 = 0.622 P_vapor / (14.7 - P_vapor)

Multiply:

0.00602*(14.7 - P_vapor) = 0.622 P_vapor

0.088374 - 0.00602 P_vapor = 0.622 P_vapor

0.088374 = 0.62802 P_vapor

P_vapor ≈ 0.088374 / 0.62802 ≈ 0.1407 psi.

Then RH = 0.1407 / 0.231 ≈ 61%, which is higher than the given 55%. So that's incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that specific humidity might be 0.00702 lbm/lbm. Let me try that.

w = 0.00702 = 0.622 P_vapor / (14.7 - P_vapor)

Multiply:

0.00702*(14.7 - P_vapor) = 0.622 P_vapor

0.102994 - 0.00702 P_vapor = 0.622 P_vapor

0.102994 = 0.62902 P_vapor

P_vapor ≈ 0.102994 / 0.62902 ≈ 0.1635 psi.

RH = 0.1635 / 0.231 ≈ 70.7%, which is way higher than 55%. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again. The only options where specific humidity remains constant are A, G, H, I.

Looking at part (c), which is the heat added per lbm of dry air. The heat added would depend on the change in enthalpy of the air. The formula is q = h2 - h1, where h is the specific enthalpy.

But specific enthalpy of air can be found using the relation h = c_p*T + w*h_g, where c_p is the specific heat at constant pressure, T is temperature in °R, w is specific humidity, and h_g is the enthalpy of vaporization.

But to calculate this, I need the values of c_p and h_g. I think c_p for air is about 0.24 Btu/lbm.°R. h_g at around 60°F is approximately 1050 Btu/lbm.

Wait, but since the process is heating at constant pressure, the enthalpy change can be found using the psychrometric chart or tables.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for sensible heat factor (shf) and latent heat factor (lhf), but maybe it's easier to find the enthalpy at initial and final states.

But without specific tables, it's a bit tricky. Alternatively, I can use the specific enthalpy formula.

At initial state: 60°F, 55% RH, w1 = 0.005425 lbm/lbm.

h1 = c_p*T1 + w1*h_g(T1)

Assuming c_p ≈ 0.24 Btu/lbm.°R, T1 = 60°F = 460 + 60 = 520°R.

h1 ≈ 0.24 * 520 + 0.005425 * 1050 ≈ 124.8 + 5.701 ≈ 130.5 Btu/lbm.

At final state: 85°F, same w2 = 0.005425 lbm/lbm.

T2 = 85 + 460 = 545°R.

h2 ≈ 0.24 * 545 + 0.005425 * 1050 ≈ 130.8 + 5.701 ≈ 136.5 Btu/lbm.

So heat added q = h2 - h1 ≈ 136.5 - 130.5 = 6.0 Btu/lbm.

Looking at the options, option G says heat added is 6.0 Btu/lbm, and it has initial and final specific humidities as 0.00652 lbm/lbm. But according to my earlier calculation, the initial w is 0.005425, not 0.00652. So there's a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps I should check option A: heat added is 5.1 Btu/lbm. That would imply a smaller change in temperature, but the temperature change is 25°F, which should require more heat.

Wait, maybe my approach is wrong. Another way is to use the enthalpy change formula for air with humidity.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the relation that for air at constant pressure and specific humidity, the enthalpy change is c_p*(T2 - T1) + w*(h_g2 - h_g1). But h_g varies with temperature, so maybe it's better to use the psychrometric table values.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the sensible heat factor. The sensible heat ratio (SHR) is c_p*T/(c_p*T + w*h_g). But this might complicate things.

Wait, maybe I should just go with the options. Since my calculation for the heat added came to about 6.0 Btu/lbm, which matches option G's 6.0 Btu/lbm. However, option G's specific humidity is 0.00652, which doesn't match my initial calculation. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial specific humidity.

Wait, perhaps the correct initial specific humidity is 0.00602 lbm/lbm, as in option B. Let me check the heat added with that.

If w1 = 0.00602 lbm/lbm, then h1 = 0.24*520 + 0.00602*1050 ≈ 124.8 + 6.321 ≈ 131.121 Btu/lbm.

h2 = 0.24*545 + 0.00602*1050 ≈ 130.8 + 6.321 ≈ 137.121 Btu/lbm.

q = 137.121 - 131.121 = 6.0 Btu/lbm. That matches option G's heat added, but option G's specific humidity is 0.00652.

Hmm, this is getting too confusing. I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options.

Looking at the options, option A has heat added as 5.1 Btu/lbm, which seems low for a 25°F rise. Option G has 6.0, which seems more reasonable. But according to my initial specific humidity calculation, option G's specific humidity is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, with initial and final specific humidity at 0.00802, but that would imply a higher RH than given.

Wait, perhaps I should accept that my initial specific humidity calculation is incorrect and proceed based on the heat added.

If the heat added is 6.0 Btu/lbm, then option G is the choice. But since option G's specific humidity is 0.00652, which I calculated would lead to a higher RH than 55%, perhaps that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the specific humidity calculation. Let me try to find a source for specific humidity at 60°F and 55% RH. From some references, I found that at 60°F, the saturation specific humidity is approximately 0.0100 lbm/lbm. So at 55% RH, w = 0.55 * 0.0100 = 0.0055 lbm/lbm. So initial w is 0.0055.

Looking at the options, none have this. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the answer intended a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the specific humidity remains the same, and the final relative humidity is lower. Among the options, option A has final RH 22.64%, which is lower than initial 55%, which makes sense.

But option A's specific humidity is 0.00802, which would imply higher RH than 55% at 60°F, which is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, despite the discrepancy in specific humidity, because its heat added matches my initial calculation.

Wait, no, my heat added calculation gave 6.0 Btu/lbm, which matches option G's heat added. But option G's initial specific humidity is 0.00652, which is higher than 0.0055, implying higher RH than 55%, which is incorrect.

I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the heat added, option G's 6.0 Btu/lbm seems plausible, even though the specific humidity may not align perfectly. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the specific humidity is 0.00652 lbm/lbm, as in option G, and the initial RH is 55%. Let me check that.

w = 0.00652 = 0.622 P_vapor / (14.7 - P_vapor)

Solving for P_vapor,

0.00652*(14.7 - P_vapor) = 0.622 P_vapor

0.095484 - 0.00652 P_vapor = 0.622 P_vapor

0.095484 = 0.62852 P_vapor

P_vapor ≈ 0.095484 / 0.62852 ≈ 0.1518 psi.

RH = (0.1518 / 0.231) *100 ≈ 65.6%, which is higher than the given 55%. So option G's initial RH would be 65.6%, not 55%, so it's incorrect.

I think I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me try to find the specific humidity from a psychrometric chart. At 60°F and 55% RH, the specific humidity is approximately 0.0055 lbm/lbm. So none of the options match exactly. But looking at the options, option C has initial 0.00602, which is close. Let's see what the final specific humidity would be if the initial is 0.00602.

But according to the problem, specific humidity remains constant, so final specific humidity is also 0.00602, which would match option C's initial 0.00602 and final 0.00502. Wait, no, that's a decrease, which can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The correct answer is likely option A, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: specific humidity remains constant. So the final relative humidity would be lower than initial 55%. Let's see which options have a lower RH.

Options A: 22.64% (much lower)
B: 23.64%
C:26.50%
D:27.50%
E:21.64%
F:20.64%
G:25.14%
H:24.64%
I:23.14%
J:28.64%

So options A, B, E, F have lower RH. Now, which of these could be correct.

Calculating final RH using specific humidity 0.005425 at 85°F.

P_vapor = (w (P - P_vapor)) / 0.622

Wait, no, better to use w = 0.622 P_vapor / (P - P_vapor)

0.005425 = 0.622 P_vapor / (14.7 - P_vapor)

Multiply:

0.005425*(14.7 - P_vapor) = 0.622 P_vapor

0.07952 - 0.005425 P_vapor = 0.622 P_vapor

0.07952 = 0.627425 P_vapor

P_vapor ≈ 0.1267 psi.

At 85°F, P_sat is 1.311 psi.

RH = (0.1267 / 1.311) *100 ≈ 9.66%, which is not among the options.

This suggests that none of the options are correct, which is unlikely. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the process isn't isobaric? No, the problem states the pressure is 14.7 psia, so it's constant.

Wait, perhaps the specific humidity increases because when heated, the air can hold more moisture. But specific humidity is the actual amount, not the capacity. So if no moisture is added, specific humidity remains the same.

I think I've spent enough time on this. Based on the heat added calculation, option G's 6.0 Btu/lbm seems plausible, but its specific humidity is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.
</think>

The problem involves determining the specific humidity, relative humidity, and heat added during the heating of an air-vapor mixture. The initial temperature is 60°F with 55% relative humidity, and the final temperature is 85°F. The pressure is constant at 14.7 psia.

### Key Calculations and Analysis:

1. **Initial Specific Humidity (w₁):**
   - Using the formula \( w = \frac{0.622 \cdot P_{\text{vapor}}}{P - P_{\text{vapor}}} \), where \( P_{\text{vapor}} = 0.55 \cdot P_{\text{sat}} \) at 60°F (\( P_{\text{sat}} = 0.231 \, \text{psi} \)):
     \[
     P_{\text{vapor}} = 0.55 \cdot 0.231 = 0.12705 \, \text{psi}
     \]
     \[
     w₁ = \frac{0.622 \cdot 0.12705}{14.7 - 0.12705} \approx 0.005425 \, \text{lbm vapor/lbm dry air}
     \]

2. **Final Specific Humidity (w₂):**
   - Since specific humidity remains constant during heating without moisture addition:
     \[
     w₂ = w₁ = 0.005425 \, \text{lbm vapor/lbm dry air}
     \]

3. **Final Relative Humidity (φ₂):**
   - At 85°F, \( P_{\text{sat}} = 1.311 \, \text{psi} \). Using \( P_{\text{vapor}} \) from \( w₂ \):
     \[
     P_{\text{vapor}} = \frac{w₂ \cdot (P - P_{\text{vapor}})}{0.622} \approx 0.1267 \, \text{psi}
     \]
     \[
     \phi₂ = \frac{P_{\text{vapor}}}{P_{\text{sat}}} \cdot 100 = \frac{0.1267}{1.311} \cdot 100 \approx 9.66\%
     \]

4. **Heat Added (\( q \)):**
   - Using enthalpy change:
     \[
     q = h₂ - h₁ = c_p \cdot (T₂ - T₁) + w \cdot (h_g₂ - h_g₁)
     \]
     Assuming \( c_p = 0.24 \, \text{Btu/lbm}^\circ \text{R} \), \( h_g \approx 1050 \, \text{Btu/lbm} \), \( T₁ = 520 \, \text{R} \), \( T₂ = 545 \, \text{R} \):
     \[
     h₁ \approx 0.24 \cdot 520 + 0.005425 \cdot 1050 \approx 130.5 \, \text{Btu/lbm}
     \]
     \[
     h₂ \approx 0.24 \cdot 545 + 0.005425 \cdot 1050 \approx 136.5 \, \text{Btu/lbm}
     \]
     \[
     q = 136.5 - 130.5 = 6.0 \, \text{Btu/lbm}
     \]

### Option Analysis:
- **Option A:** Specific humidity \( 0.00802 \, \text{lbm/lbm} \) is incorrect as it implies a higher RH than 55% at 60°F.
- **Option G:** Heat added \( 6.0 \, \text{Btu/lbm} \) matches the calculation, but specific humidity \( 0.00652 \, \text{lbm/lbm} \) implies a higher RH than 55% at 60°F.
- **Option C:** Incorrect as it suggests a decrease in specific humidity, which is not possible without moisture removal.
- **Option E:** Incorrect as it suggests an increase in specific humidity and a higher RH than calculated.

### Conclusion:
Based on the heat added calculation, **Option G** is the most plausible despite discrepancies in specific humidity, as it aligns with the enthalpy change.
