Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have three functions: f(x) = 3x, g(x) = 5x + 3, and h(x) = 1 – x². We need to find f(g(h(x))), which means we'll have to compose these functions in the order h first, then g, then f.

First, I'll start by figuring out what h(x) is. The function h(x) is given as 1 minus x squared, so h(x) = 1 – x². That part's straightforward.

Next, we need to find g of h(x). So, g(h(x)) means I substitute h(x) into g wherever there's an x. The function g(x) is 5x + 3, so substituting h(x) in place of x gives us g(h(x)) = 5*(h(x)) + 3. Plugging in h(x) = 1 – x², that becomes g(h(x)) = 5*(1 – x²) + 3.

Now, let's compute that. Multiplying 5 into the parentheses: 5*1 is 5, and 5*(-x²) is -5x². So, 5*(1 – x²) is 5 – 5x². Then we add the 3 from the function g(x), so 5 – 5x² + 3. Adding the constants 5 and 3 gives us 8. So, g(h(x)) simplifies to -5x² + 8. Wait, no, that's not right because 5 –5x² +3 is 8 –5x². Oh, wait, no, 5 +3 is 8, so it should be -5x² +8. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check again. Wait, 5*(1 –x²) is 5 –5x², and then adding 3 gives 5 +3 =8, so yes, it's 8 –5x². Alternatively, it can be written as -5x² +8. Okay, that seems correct.

Now, the next step is to find f of g(h(x)). So, f(g(h(x))) = f(g(h(x))). Since f(x) is 3x, we substitute g(h(x)) into f. So, f(something) is 3*(something). In this case, that something is g(h(x)), which we found to be 8 –5x². So, f(g(h(x))) = 3*(8 –5x²).

Let's compute that. Multiply 3 by each term inside the parentheses. 3*8 is 24, and 3*(-5x²) is -15x². So, putting it together, f(g(h(x))) = 24 –15x², which can also be written as -15x² +24. 

Looking at the options provided, let's see which one matches this result. Option A is -15x² +24, which is exactly what we have. Option E is -30x² +24, which doesn't match because the coefficient of x² is -30 instead of -15. Option G is -15x² +18, which is close but the constant term is 18, not 24. Option H is -15x² +30, which is also incorrect. So, the correct answer must be Option A.

Wait, but let me double-check all steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting again:

h(x) =1 –x².

g(h(x)) =5*(1 –x²) +3 = 5 –5x² +3 =8 –5x².

f(g(h(x))) =3*(8 –5x²) =24 –15x², which is -15x² +24. Yes, that's correct. So, the answer should be Option A.

The composition f(g(h(x))) is calculated by first applying h(x) = 1 – x², then g to h(x) resulting in 8 – 5x², and finally applying f to that result, yielding -15x² + 24.

Answer: A
