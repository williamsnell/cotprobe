Alright, so I came across this multiple-choice question about goals, specifically asking what kind of a goal money is. The options are A through G: Extrinsic, Ultimate, Abstract, Intrinsic, Fundamental, Natural, Artificial. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I should recall what each of these terms means in the context of goal types. I remember that goals can be categorized in various ways based on their nature and purpose. Let me break it down.

Money is something people often work towards, save for, or spend time earning. But is it an intrinsic or extrinsic goal? I think intrinsic goals are things that are valuable for their own sake, like personal happiness or learning. Extrinsic goals are those that are means to an end, something you pursue for other outcomes. So money is usually a means to buy things, experiences, or other goals, which makes it extrinsic.

Looking at the options, A is Extrinsic goal, which seems to fit. Let me check the other options to be sure. B is Ultimate goal. I don't think money is the ultimate goal for everyone; people have different ultimate goals, like family, health, or legacy. So B might not be it.

C is Abstract goal. Abstract refers to something non-physical or conceptual. Money is a concrete thing, so I don't think that's the right fit. D is Intrinsic goal, which we already considered as less likely because money is a means.

E is Fundamental goal. Fundamental might refer to something basic, like a primary need, but I'm not sure if money is considered a fundamental goal or just a tool. It's more of a tool for other goals, so maybe not E.

F is Natural goal. Natural would imply something inherent or part of nature. Money is a human construct, so F doesn't seem right. G is Artificial goal. Artificial also refers to human-made, but I don't think that's the usual way to categorize goals. It's more about the purpose rather than the origin.

So putting it all together, money is an extrinsic goal because it's something people pursue as a means to achieve other ends, like buying a house or traveling. Therefore, the answer should be A: Extrinsic goal.

The correct answer is A: Extrinsic goal, as money is typically pursued as a means to achieve other ends rather than being an end in itself.
