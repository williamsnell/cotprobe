Alright, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Okay, the question says a stone is thrown vertically upward with an initial speed of 5 m/s. We need to find the velocity after 3 seconds. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with vertical motion under gravity, we can use the kinematic equations.

Wait, the initial velocity is upwards, so that's positive, right? Let me think about the direction. Yeah, usually in these problems, upward is positive and downward is negative. Gravity acts downward, so the acceleration due to gravity would be negative. Oh right, the acceleration (g) is approximately 9.8 m/s² downward, so in our case, it's -9.8 m/s².

The question is about velocity after a certain time. I think the right equation to use here is the one that relates velocity, initial velocity, acceleration, and time. The equation is v = u + at. Yeah, that's right. So v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity, a is acceleration, and t is time.

Let me plug in the values. The initial velocity u is 5 m/s upwards, so u = 5. Acceleration a is -9.8 m/s² because it's acting downward. Time t is 3 seconds. So putting it all together: v = 5 + (-9.8)*3.

Wait, let me calculate that. 5 minus (9.8 * 3). 9.8 times 3 is 29.4. So 5 - 29.4 equals... that's -24.4 m/s. Oh wait, negative velocity means it's moving downward. So the velocity is 24.4 m/s downward.

But wait, looking at the options, I don't see 24.4 m/s. The options go up to 35 m/s. Let me check if I did the calculation right. Oh, wait, maybe I made a mistake with the signs. Let me double-check. The initial velocity is 5 m/s upward, so positive. Acceleration is downward, so negative. So 5 + (-9.8)*3 is 5 - 29.4 = -24.4 m/s. That seems correct.

Looking at the options, the closest one is option A: 25 m/s downward, which is about right because 24.4 is close to 25. Alternatively, maybe the problem uses g as 10 m/s² for simplicity. Let me try that. If g is 10, then a = -10. So v = 5 + (-10)*3 = 5 -30 = -25 m/s. That gives exactly 25 m/s downward, which is option A.

Wait, but in real life, g is about 9.8, so maybe the problem expects using 10 m/s² for easier calculation. Either way, the answer would be around 25 m/s downward. Let me look at the options again. Option A is 25 downward, which fits. Option J is 15 downward, which is too low. So the correct answer should be A: 25 m/s, downward.

The velocity of the stone after 3 seconds is calculated using the kinematic equation \( v = u + at \). With an initial velocity \( u = 5 \, \text{m/s} \) upwards, acceleration \( a = -9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) (due to gravity), and time \( t = 3 \, \text{s} \), the final velocity is approximately \( -24.4 \, \text{m/s} \) (downward). Considering common approximations for gravity, the answer aligns with option A: 25 m/s, downward.
