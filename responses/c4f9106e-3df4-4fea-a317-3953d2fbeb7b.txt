Alright, I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question. The question is asking which task, on average, men perform better than women on all the options except one. So I need to find the exception where women might perform as well or better than men.

The options are from A to J. Let's go through each one by one.

Option A: Mental rotation. I remember that mental rotation is a type of spatial reasoning task. From what I've heard, men generally perform better on this, so I don't think this is the exception.

Option B: Visual-spatial tasks. Again, I think men usually have an edge here. They might do better in tasks like getting lost less often or visualizing objects in space. So probably not B.

Option C: Abstract reasoning tests. These involve problem-solving and pattern recognition. I'm not sure about the gender differences here. I think both genders can perform similarly, but I'm not certain. Maybe this is a candidate for the exception.

Option D: Emotional intelligence tests. Emotional intelligence is about understanding and managing emotions. I've read that women generally score higher on emotional intelligence. So D could be the exception where women perform better.

Option E: Simultaneous processing. This refers to handling multiple tasks at once. I'm not too sure about the gender differences here. Some studies suggest women might be better at multitasking, but I'm not certain. Maybe this is a possibility.

Option F: Spatial reasoning. Similar to mental rotation, men tend to do better here. So F is likely not the exception.

Option G: Memory recall tasks. I think women might have an advantage here, especially in certain types of memory like verbal memory. So G could be the exception.

Option H: Mathematical problem solving. Men are often thought to excel more in areas like advanced math, but I'm not sure if this is the case across all math tasks. Maybe women are equally good in some areas, but on average, H might not be the exception.

Option I: Target-directed motor skills. This could involve tasks like aiming or precision movements. I think men might be better here, so I probably isn't the exception.

Option J: Physical strength tests. Definitely, men on average have more muscle mass and strength, so J isn't the exception.

Now, looking back, the options where women might perform better are D (emotional intelligence), G (memory), and maybe E (simultaneous processing). But I think emotional intelligence is a strong candidate because it's well-documented that women generally score higher in this area. So the exception would be D: Emotional intelligence tests.

The exception is D: Emotional intelligence tests, as women generally perform better on average.

Answer: D
