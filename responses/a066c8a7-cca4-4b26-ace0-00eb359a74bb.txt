Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Parfit and his views on the magnitude of pains. I remember that Parfit is a philosopher who dealt with issues related to personal identity and the nature of consciousness. But I'm not exactly sure about his specific stance on pain comparison. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking about the comparability of the magnitude of pains. The options are A through D, each suggesting a different level of comparability. From what I recall, Parfit discusses whether it's possible to compare pains, either within the same person or across different people.

I think he might have argued that we can compare our own pains over time because we have a sort of internal reference point. For example, if I experience a pain today that's stronger than one I felt yesterday, I can tell that it's more intense. This would suggest that within an individual, pains can be compared. But when it comes to comparing pains between different people, it's tricky because each person's sensitivity to pain can vary. There's no objective measure to say whether one person's pain is more intense than another's because we can't directly experience their pain.

So, looking at the options, option C says that pains can be compared within individuals but not between them. That seems to fit with what I remember Parfit saying. Option A suggests precise comparison, which I'm not sure about because pain is subjective and might not always be precisely measurable. Option B is about rough comparisons, which could apply, but I think Parfit's point was more about the impossibility of comparing across individuals, not just roughness. Option D says they can't be compared at all, both within and between, but I believe he did allow for within-individual comparisons.

Therefore, the answer should be option C.

The answer is C: can be compared within individuals, but not between individuals.
