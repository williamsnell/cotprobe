Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about price elasticity of demand and what a business should do to increase its revenue. Let me break it down.

The question states that the business knows the demand price elasticity of its product is 0.78. I remember that price elasticity measures how much the quantity demanded responds to a change in price. The formula is usually percentage change in quantity demanded divided by percentage change in price. Elasticity is considered elastic if it's greater than 1, inelastic if it's less than 1, and unit elastic if it's exactly 1.

So here, the elasticity is 0.78, which is less than 1. That means demand is inelastic. In an inelastic situation, if the price goes up, the quantity demanded doesn't decrease much, so total revenue would increase. Conversely, if the price goes down, the quantity demanded doesn't increase enough to make up for the lower price, so revenue would decrease.

Wait, but the business wants to increase its revenue. So if demand is inelastic, they should probably increase the price. Because when you raise the price and demand doesn't drop much, the total revenue (price multiplied by quantity) goes up.

Looking at the options, let's see which ones make sense. The options are A to J. Let's go through them quickly:

A: Maintain current price because demand is unit elastic. No, because unit elastic is when elasticity is exactly 1, but here it's 0.78, so A is wrong.

B: Increase price because demand is inelastic. That seems to fit. Since elasticity is 0.78 (inelastic), increasing price would boost revenue.

C: Decrease price because demand is unit elastic. No, same reason as A; it's not unit elastic.

D: Decrease price because demand is inelastic. Wait, if demand is inelastic, decreasing price would lower revenue because the quantity increase isn't enough to offset the price drop. So D might not be correct.

E: Increase price because demand is unit elastic. No, because elasticity isn't 1 here.

F: Maintain current price because demand is inelastic. Hmm, not sure. If demand is inelastic, why maintain? They could increase price to get more revenue.

G: Decrease price because demand is unit inelastic. Not sure what that means. Elasticity is 0.78, so inelastic. But decreasing price when demand is inelastic would lower revenue, so G seems incorrect.

H: Decrease price because demand is elastic. No, because 0.78 is inelastic, not elastic.

I: Maintain current price because demand is elastic. No, same issue as H.

J: Increase price because demand is elastic. No, elasticity is 0.78, so J is wrong.

So the correct choice seems to be B: increase price because demand is inelastic. That aligns with what I remember about inelastic demand leading to higher prices for increased revenue.

The demand price elasticity of 0.78 indicates inelastic demand. In such cases, increasing the price will lead to an increase in total revenue because the percentage change in quantity demanded is smaller than the percentage change in price. Therefore, the business should increase its price.

Answer: B
