Okay, so I have this economics question about marginal cost (MC) and average costs. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking when MC is equal to both AVC (average variable cost) and ATC (average total cost). Let me recall. I remember that in cost curves, MC is the derivative of the total cost, so it's the additional cost of producing one more unit. AVC is the variable cost per unit, so it's total variable cost divided by quantity. ATC is total cost divided by quantity, which includes both fixed and variable costs.

I think there's something about the point where MC equals AVC and ATC. From what I remember, the MC curve intersects the AVC curve at the minimum point of AVC. Similarly, MC intersects the ATC curve at the minimum point of ATC. So when MC equals both, that must be when both AVC and ATC are at their minimums.

Wait, let me visualize the graphs. The AVC curve is U-shaped, as are the MC and ATC curves. The MC curve is usually below AVC when AVC is decreasing and above when AVC is increasing. The point where MC equals AVC is the bottom of the AVC curve. Similarly, the same MC curve intersects the ATC curve at the bottom of the ATC curve. So at that specific quantity, MC equals both AVC and ATC because that's the point where both average costs are minimized.

So looking at the options, option H says MC intersects AVC and ATC at their minimum points. That sounds right. Let me check the other options to be sure.

Option A talks about average points, which doesn't make sense. Option C says maximum points, but I think the intersection is at the minimum. Option G mentions the minimum point of MC, but wait, MC doesn't have a minimum point in the same wayâ€”MC is a U-shaped curve too, but it's the slope of the total cost curve. The intersection is when MC is at its minimum? Wait, no, because the minimum of MC would be where the slope is zero, but the point where MC equals AVC and ATC is when those averages are at their minima.

Option H says MC intersects AVC and ATC at their minimum points. That fits. So the answer should be H.

The correct answer is H: MC intersects AVC and ATC at their minimum points.

**Answer: H**
