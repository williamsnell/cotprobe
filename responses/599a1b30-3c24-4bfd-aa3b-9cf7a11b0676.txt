Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the gravitational force between the Earth and the Moon. Hmm, I remember from school that this involves Newton's law of universal gravitation. Let me try to recall how that works.

Newton's formula is F = G*(M*m)/r², where F is the gravitational force, G is the gravitational constant, M and m are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between their centers.

The given values are: Earth's mass is 5.97 × 10^24 kg, Moon's mass is 7.35 × 10^22 kg, and the distance between their centers is 3.84 × 10^8 meters. Oh, and G is approximately 6.67 × 10^-11 N·m²/kg². Right, I think I got all the numbers.

Wait, but the question is asking for an estimate, so maybe I don't need to calculate the exact number. I can approximate the powers of ten to make it easier. Let me jot down the approximate values in scientific notation.

So, M ≈ 6 × 10^24 kg, m ≈ 7 × 10^22 kg. The distance r is about 4 × 10^8 m. G is about 7 × 10^-11 N·m²/kg².

Plugging into the formula: F = (7e-11) * (6e24 * 7e22) / (4e8)^2.

Let me calculate the numerator first. 6e24 * 7e22 is (6*7) * 10^(24+22) = 42e46, which is 4.2e47. Then multiply by G: 7e-11 * 4.2e47 = (7*4.2) e ( -11 +47 ) = 29.4e36, which is approximately 2.94e37.

Now the denominator: (4e8)^2 = 16e16 = 1.6e17.

So F ≈ 2.94e37 / 1.6e17 = (2.94 / 1.6) e^(37-17) ≈ 1.8375e20. So that's about 2e20 Newtons.

Wait, wait, looking at the options, the closest one would be 10^19 N or 10^20 N? Oh, but let me check my approximations again because I might have made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, 6e24 *7e22 = 42e46, which is correct. Then 7e-11 *42e46: 7*42 is 294, and 10^(-11+46)=10^35. So 294e35 is 2.94e37. That's right.

Then denominator: (4e8)^2 = 16e16 = 1.6e17. Dividing 2.94e37 by 1.6e17 gives (2.94/1.6) e^(37-17) = about 1.8375e20. So approximately 2e20 N.

Looking at the options, option B is 10^19 N, which is one order of magnitude lower. Hmm, did I do something wrong?

Wait, maybe I messed up the exponents. Let me recheck. Wait, the denominator: (4e8)^2 is (4)^2 = 16, and (e8)^2 is e16, so 16e16 = 1.6e17. That's correct.

Wait, but wait a second: another approach. Let's calculate the exponents more carefully.

F = G * (M * m) / r².

Breaking down each part:

M = 5.97e24 ≈6e24,

m=7.35e22≈7e22,

r=3.84e8≈4e8,

G=6.67e-11≈7e-11.

So,

M*m = 6e24 *7e22 = (6*7)e^(24+22) =42e46 =4.2e47 kg².

Multiply by G: 7e-11 *4.2e47 =7*4.2=29.4, and 10^(-11+47)=10^36. So 29.4e36 =2.94e37.

Divide by r²: (4e8)^2=16e16=1.6e17.

So F=2.94e37 /1.6e17 = (2.94/1.6)e(37-17) = approx 1.8375e20 N.

Wait, but the options don't have 1e20. Option B is 1e19, which is ten times smaller. Did I make a miscalculation?

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately. Let's do the numbers again without approximating so much.

G is 6.67e-11, M=5.97e24, m=7.35e22, r=3.84e8.

So F = (6.67e-11) * (5.97e24 *7.35e22) / (3.84e8)^2.

First compute 5.97e24 *7.35e22:

5.97 *7.35 ≈ let's calculate: 5 *7=35, 5 *0.35=1.75, 0.97*7=6.79, 0.97*0.35≈0.3395. Adding up: 35 +1.75=36.75, +6.79=43.54, +0.3395≈43.8795. So approximately 43.88e(24+22)=43.88e46, which is 4.388e47.

Multiply by G: 6.67e-11 *4.388e47 = 6.67 *4.388 ≈ let's see: 6*4=24, 6*0.388≈2.328, 0.67*4≈2.68, 0.67*0.388≈0.26. Adding up all parts: 24 +2.328=26.328 +2.68=28.008 +0.26≈28.268. So 28.268e( -11 +47 )=28.268e36 =2.8268e37.

Now, denominator: (3.84e8)^2 = (3.84)^2 *10^(8*2)=14.7456e16 =1.47456e17.

So F=2.8268e37 /1.47456e17 = (2.8268 /1.47456)e(37-17) = approximately 1.915e20 N.

So that's about 1.9e20 N. But the options don't have 10^20. The closest options are B:1e19, J:1e49, etc. Wait, none of the options are 1e20. Did I make a mistake in calculation?

Wait, let me check the exponents again.

Wait, 5.97e24 *7.35e22 = 5.97*7.35 = approx 43.88, times 1e46, correct.

Then G is 6.67e-11, so 6.67e-11 *43.88e46 = ?

Wait, 6.67e-11 *43.88e46 = (6.67 *43.88) * 1e(-11+46) = (approx 291.3) *1e35 =2.913e37.

Divided by (3.84e8)^2 = (3.84^2) *1e16 = 14.7456e16 =1.47456e17.

So F=2.913e37 /1.47456e17 = (2.913/1.47456) e20.

2.913 /1.47456 ≈ approx 1.973, so F≈1.973e20 N.

Wait, but the options don't have 1e20. The options are:

A:1e79

B:1e19

C:1e99

D:1e59

E:1e39

F:1e89

G:1e69

H:1e9

I:1e29

J:1e49

So none of the options is 1e20. Hmm, that's confusing. Did I miscalculate somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I should try another approach. Maybe using the exact numbers without approximating as much.

Let me compute F step by step.

F = (6.67e-11) * (5.97e24 *7.35e22) / (3.84e8)^2.

First, compute the numerator: 6.67e-11 *5.97e24 *7.35e22.

Wait, 5.97e24 *7.35e22 =5.97 *7.35 = let's compute 5 *7 =35, 5 *0.35=1.75, 0.97*7=6.79, 0.97*0.35≈0.3395.

Adding: 35 +1.75=36.75 +6.79=43.54 +0.3395≈43.8795.

So 43.8795e46 =4.38795e47.

Multiply by G: 6.67e-11 *4.38795e47 =6.67 *4.38795 ≈ let's compute:

6 *4=24, 6 *0.38795≈2.3277, 0.67 *4=2.68, 0.67 *0.38795≈0.26.

Adding: 24 +2.3277=26.3277 +2.68=28.0077 +0.26≈28.2677.

So 28.2677e36 =2.82677e37.

Divide by (3.84e8)^2 = (3.84)^2 =14.7456. So 14.7456e16 =1.47456e17.

So F=2.82677e37 /1.47456e17 = (2.82677 /1.47456) e20.

2.82677 /1.47456 ≈ 1.915, so F≈1.915e20 N.

Wait, but the options don't have this. Did I perhaps make a mistake in the exponents? Let me check the exponents again.

Wait, 5.97e24 *7.35e22 = 5.97*7.35e(24+22)=43.8795e46=4.38795e47.

Then 6.67e-11 *4.38795e47 = 6.67*4.38795e( -11 +47 )=6.67*4.38795e36.

6.67 *4.38795 ≈ let me compute accurately: 6*4=24, 6*0.38795≈2.3277, 0.67*4≈2.68, 0.67*0.38795≈0.26. Sum is 24+2.3277=26.3277 +2.68=28.0077 +0.26≈28.2677. So 28.2677e36 =2.82677e37.

Divide by (3.84e8)^2 =3.84^2 *1e16=14.7456e16=1.47456e17.

So F=2.82677e37 /1.47456e17 = (2.82677 /1.47456) e20.

2.82677 ÷1.47456 is approximately 1.915, so F≈1.915e20 N.

But the options don't have 1e20. So perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent calculations. Let me check the exponents again.

Wait, 5.97e24 *7.35e22 is 5.97*7.35e46 =43.8795e46=4.38795e47.

Then 6.67e-11 *4.38795e47 = (6.67 *4.38795) e ( -11 +47 ) = 29.13e36 =2.913e37.

Wait, no, 6.67 *4.38795 is actually: 6 *4=24, 6*0.38795≈2.3277, 0.67*4≈2.68, 0.67*0.38795≈0.26. So 24 +2.3277=26.3277 +2.68=28.0077 +0.26=28.2677. So 28.2677e36 =2.82677e37.

Ah, I see, earlier I think I misapplied the exponent. 6.67e-11 *4.38795e47 = (6.67*4.38795) *10^( -11 +47 )=28.2677e36=2.82677e37.

Then, denominator is (3.84e8)^2=3.84² *1e16=14.7456e16=1.47456e17.

So F=2.82677e37 /1.47456e17 = (2.82677 /1.47456) e20.

2.82677 ÷1.47456≈1.915, so F≈1.915e20 N.

But the options don't have e20. The closest is B:1e19, which is 10 times smaller. Did I miscalculate the exponents?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the formula is F = G*(M*m)/r². Let me check the exponents again.

M is 5.97e24 kg,

m is7.35e22 kg,

r is3.84e8 m,

G is6.67e-11 N·m²/kg².

So M*m =5.97e24 *7.35e22 = (5.97 *7.35) e(24+22) =43.8795e46 =4.38795e47.

Multiply by G:6.67e-11 *4.38795e47 = (6.67 *4.38795) e( -11 +47 )=29.13e36=2.913e37.

Divide by r²: (3.84e8)^2= (3.84)^2 e16=14.7456e16=1.47456e17.

So F=2.913e37 /1.47456e17 = (2.913 /1.47456)e20 ≈1.973e20 N.

Hmm, maybe the options are approximations. So 1.97e20 is roughly 2e20, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated the exponents.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute F = G*M*m/r².

Let me compute each part step by step.

Compute M*m:5.97e24 *7.35e22.

5.97 *7.35 = let's calculate:

5 *7 =35,

5 *0.35=1.75,

0.97 *7=6.79,

0.97 *0.35=0.3395.

Adding up:35+1.75=36.75 +6.79=43.54 +0.3395=43.8795.

So M*m=43.8795e46 =4.38795e47.

Multiply by G:6.67e-11 *4.38795e47 =6.67 *4.38795= approx 29.13. So 29.13e36=2.913e37.

Divide by (3.84e8)^2= (3.84)^2=14.7456e16=1.47456e17.

So F=2.913e37 /1.47456e17 = (2.913 /1.47456)e20.

2.913 /1.47456 ≈1.973, so F≈1.973e20 N.

So that's about 2e20 N. But the options don't have this. Maybe I should look for an option that's closest. The options given are:

A:1e79

B:1e19

C:1e99

D:1e59

E:1e39

F:1e89

G:1e69

H:1e9

I:1e29

J:1e49

Wait, none of these match 1e20. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Or perhaps the exponents were miscalculated.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the denominator. Let's recheck (3.84e8)^2.

3.84e8 squared is (3.84)^2 * (1e8)^2 = 14.7456 *1e16 =1.47456e17. Correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express the calculation in terms of powers of ten without precise multiplication.

Another approach: Using orders of magnitude.

M ≈6e24,

m ≈7e22,

r≈4e8,

G≈7e-11.

So F≈7e-11 * (6e24 *7e22) / (4e8)^2.

Compute numerator:6e24 *7e22 =42e46=4.2e47.

Multiply by G:7e-11 *4.2e47 =29.4e36=2.94e37.

Denominator: (4e8)^2=16e16=1.6e17.

So F≈2.94e37 /1.6e17 ≈1.8375e20 N.

Again, same result: ~2e20 N. But no such option exists.

Wait a minute, I think I see the problem. I think I may have made a mistake in the calculation of exponents. Let me check the exponents again.

Wait, 6e24 *7e22 =42e46, which is 4.2e47.

G is 7e-11, so 7e-11 *4.2e47 = (7*4.2)e( -11 +47 )=29.4e36=2.94e37.

Denominator: (4e8)^2=16e16=1.6e17.

So F=2.94e37 /1.6e17 = (2.94/1.6) e20 ≈1.8375e20.

So F≈1.84e20 N.

But the options don't have this. Wait, perhaps the options are presented in powers that are orders of magnitude away. Let me see: 1e20 is 10^20. The options are:

A:10^79

B:10^19

C:10^99

D:10^59

E:10^39

F:10^89

G:10^69

H:10^9

I:10^29

J:10^49

So 10^20 isn't an option. The closest lower is B:1e19, and the next higher is I:1e29. Hmm, but 1e20 is between B and I.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try using exact exponents without approximating.

Compute F = (6.67e-11) * (5.97e24 *7.35e22) / (3.84e8)^2.

Compute numerator step by step:

5.97e24 *7.35e22 = (5.97 *7.35) e (24+22) =43.8795e46=4.38795e47.

Multiply by 6.67e-11: 4.38795e47 *6.67e-11 = (4.38795 *6.67) e (47-11) =29.13e36=2.913e37.

Denominator: (3.84e8)^2 =14.7456e16=1.47456e17.

So F=2.913e37 /1.47456e17 = (2.913 /1.47456)e20 ≈1.973e20 N.

Wait, but again, no option matches this. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial approach. Alternatively, perhaps the options are off, but that's unlikely.

Wait, maybe I should consider the correct calculation. Let me compute it more precisely.

Compute F = (6.67430e-11) * (5.972e24 *7.3477e22) / (3.8440e8)^2.

Calculating numerator:

5.972e24 *7.3477e22 =5.972 *7.3477 = approx.

5 *7=35,

5 *0.3477≈1.7385,

0.972 *7=6.804,

0.972 *0.3477≈0.337.

Adding:35 +1.7385=36.7385 +6.804=43.5425 +0.337≈43.8795.

So 43.8795e46=4.38795e47.

Multiply by G:6.6743e-11 *4.38795e47 =6.6743 *4.38795 =approx.

Let me compute 6 *4=24,

6 *0.38795≈2.3277,

0.6743 *4≈2.6972,

0.6743 *0.38795≈0.2615.

Adding:24 +2.3277=26.3277 +2.6972=28.0249 +0.2615≈28.2864.

So 28.2864e36=2.82864e37.

Denominator: (3.8440e8)^2= (3.8440)^2=14.7708, so 14.7708e16=1.47708e17.

So F=2.82864e37 /1.47708e17 = (2.82864 /1.47708) e20.

2.82864 ÷1.47708 ≈1.914.

So F≈1.914e20 N.

Again, same result. But none of the options are close. Hmm. Wait a second, perhaps I messed up the exponent somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the denominator's exponent. Let me check: (3.84e8)^2 = (3.84)^2 *1e8^2 =14.7456 *1e16=1.47456e17. Correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should use the exact numbers without approximating G and other constants. Let me try to compute F more accurately.

Compute F = (6.67430e-11) * (5.972e24 *7.3477e22) / (3.8440e8)^2.

First, compute numerator:5.972e24 *7.3477e22 =5.972 *7.3477 = let's compute accurately.

5 *7=35,

5 *0.3477=1.7385,

0.972 *7=6.804,

0.972 *0.3477≈0.337.

Adding:35 +1.7385=36.7385 +6.804=43.5425 +0.337=43.8795.

So 43.8795e46=4.38795e47.

Multiply by G:6.6743e-11 *4.38795e47 =6.6743*4.38795= let's compute this accurately.

6*4=24,

6*0.38795=2.3277,

0.6743*4=2.6972,

0.6743*0.38795≈0.2615.

Adding:24 +2.3277=26.3277 +2.6972=28.0249 +0.2615=28.2864.

So 28.2864e36=2.82864e37.

Denominator:3.8440e8 squared is (3.8440)^2 *1e16.

3.8440^2: let's compute accurately.

3.844 *3.844:

= (3 +0.844)^2 =3^2 +2*3*0.844 +0.844^2

=9 +5.064 +0.712336 ≈14.776336.

So denominator is 14.776336e16=1.4776336e17.

Now, F=2.82864e37 /1.4776336e17 = (2.82864 /1.4776336) e20.

Compute 2.82864 ÷1.4776336:

≈1.915.

So F≈1.915e20 N.

Again, same result. So F is approximately 1.9e20 N.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the options again.

Wait, perhaps the options are in the same ballpark as 1e20 but expressed as 1e20, but it's not listed. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exponents more carefully. Let me write each step with exponents:

M =5.97e24,

m=7.35e22,

r=3.84e8,

G=6.67e-11.

F = G*M*m / r².

Compute M*m:5.97e24 *7.35e22.

= (5.97 *7.35) * 1e(24+22)

=43.8795 *1e46

=4.38795e47.

Multiply by G:6.67e-11 *4.38795e47.

= (6.67 *4.38795) *1e(-11+47)

=29.13 *1e36

=2.913e37.

Divide by r²: (3.84e8)^2 = (3.84)^2 *1e16 =14.7456 *1e16 =1.47456e17.

Now, F=2.913e37 /1.47456e17 = (2.913 /1.47456) *1e(37-17)

=1.973 *1e20

=1.973e20 N.

So F≈2e20 N.

But looking at the options, the closest is B:1e19, which is 10 times smaller. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me check the numbers again.

Wait, the problem says the Moon's mass is 7.35e22 kg. I used that correctly. Earth's mass is 5.97e24 kg. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check the formula again. The formula is correct: F = G*(M*m)/r².

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the Moon's mass is much smaller, but the calculation still holds. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presented in a way that they are orders of magnitude, and the closest is 1e20, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Let me compute the exponent as follows:

Compute F = G*M*m /r².

In exponents:

G=6.67e-11,

M=5.97e24,

m=7.35e22,

r=3.84e8.

So,

F = (6.67e-11) * (5.97e24 *7.35e22) / (3.84e8)^2.

Compute each term's exponent:

M*m=5.97e24 *7.35e22 = (5.97*7.35)e46 =43.8795e46=4.38795e47.

Multiply by G:6.67e-11 *4.38795e47= (6.67*4.38795)e36=29.13e36=2.913e37.

Divide by r²:3.84e8 squared is 14.7456e16=1.47456e17.

So F=2.913e37 /1.47456e17= (2.913 /1.47456)e20≈1.973e20 N.

Again, same result. So I'm confident that F is approximately 2e20 N.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I should look for an option that's 1e20, but it's not there. The options are A:1e79, B:1e19, C:1e99, D:1e59, E:1e39, F:1e89, G:1e69, H:1e9, I:1e29, J:1e49.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the exponents. Let me check the exponents again.

Wait, when I multiply 6.67e-11 by 4.38795e47, the exponents are -11 +47=36. So 6.67e-11 *4.38795e47=29.13e36=2.913e37.

Divide by 1.47456e17: 37-17=20. So 2.913e37 /1.47456e17=1.973e20.

Yes, that's correct. So F≈1.97e20 N.

But again, no option matches. Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem asks for the best estimate. Maybe the options are approximations, and 1e20 is closest to option I:1e29? No, that's an order of magnitude higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try using precise exponents without approximating the numbers.

Compute F as follows:

F = (6.67430e-11) * (5.972e24 *7.3477e22) / (3.8440e8)^2.

Exact calculation:

Compute 5.972e24 *7.3477e22 =5.972 *7.3477 =43.8795e46=4.38795e47.

Multiply by 6.6743e-11:4.38795e47 *6.6743e-11 = (4.38795 *6.6743) e36.

4.38795 *6.6743 ≈29.13 → 29.13e36=2.913e37.

Denominator:3.8440e8 squared is (3.8440)^2=14.776336e16=1.4776336e17.

F=2.913e37 /1.4776336e17 = (2.913/1.4776336)e20 ≈1.973e20 N.

Same result. So perhaps the options are incorrect, but more likely, I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the Earth's gravitational force on the Moon, which is the same as the Moon's gravitational force on the Earth, but that doesn't change the calculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should consider using the Earth's mass and the Moon's mass in the formula, but since the Earth is much more massive, the force on the Moon is the same as the force on the Earth, which is what we're calculating.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the formula again. Wait, Newton's third law states that the forces are equal and opposite, so the magnitude is the same. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I used the correct value for G. G is 6.674×10^-11 N·m²/kg². I used 6.67e-11, which is correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem expects me to use a different value for G, like 10^-11, which would make the calculation easier. Let me try that.

Using G=10^-11 N·m²/kg².

So F = (1e-11) * (6e24 *7e22) / (4e8)^2.

Compute numerator:6e24*7e22=42e46=4.2e47.

Multiply by G:1e-11 *4.2e47=4.2e36.

Denominator: (4e8)^2=16e16=1.6e17.

F=4.2e36 /1.6e17=2.625e19 N.

So F≈2.6e19 N, which is approximately 3e19 N. So the closest option would be B:1e19 N, but it's an order of magnitude lower. Hmm.

Wait, but using G=10^-11 gives F≈2.6e19 N, which is about 3e19. So option B is 1e19, which is an order of magnitude less. But the correct calculation with precise G gives 2e20 N, which is an order of magnitude higher than option J:1e29. Wait, no, 2e20 is lower than J:1e29.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to approximate G as 1e-11, leading to F≈2.6e19, which would be closest to option B:1e19.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use exponents more roughly, leading to an estimate of 1e20, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is B:1e19.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting results. Using precise G gives 2e20, which isn't an option. Using G=1e-11 gives 2.6e19, which is closer to option B.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation when using the precise G value. Let me check.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute F using exponents only.

Compute F = G*M*m/(r²).

G=6.67e-11,

M=6e24,

m=7e22,

r=4e8.

So,

F= (6.67e-11) * (6e24 *7e22) / (4e8)^2.

Compute numerator:6e24 *7e22=42e46=4.2e47.

Multiply by G:6.67e-11 *4.2e47= (6.67 *4.2)e( -11 +47 )=28.014e36=2.8014e37.

Denominator: (4e8)^2=16e16=1.6e17.

So F=2.8014e37 /1.6e17 = (2.8014 /1.6) e20 ≈1.7509e20 N.

Again, same result: ~1.75e20 N.

But no option exists for 1e20. So perhaps the intended answer is option B:1e19, assuming an approximation of G as 1e-11.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of G=1e-11, leading to F≈2.6e19 N, which is closer to option B:1e19.

Wait, but the correct calculation with precise G is about 2e20 N, which is not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option B:1e19, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another way. Let's compute the exponent of F:

F = (G*M*m) / r².

The exponents:

G:10^-11,

M:10^24,

m:10^22,

r:10^8.

So,

G*M*m =10^-11 *10^24 *10^22=10^( -11+24+22 )=10^35.

r²= (10^8)^2=10^16.

So F=10^35 /10^16=10^19.

Ah! So the exponent is 10^19 N. So the answer is B:1e19 N.

Wait, that's a different approach. Let me explain: When dealing with exponents, I can ignore the coefficients and just add the exponents.

G is 1e-11,

M is 1e24,

m is1e22,

so G*M*m=1e-11 *1e24 *1e22=1e( -11+24+22 )=1e35.

r²= (1e8)^2=1e16.

So F=1e35 /1e16=1e19 N.

So the answer is B:1e19 N.

Ah, I see. So this approach gives 1e19 N, which matches option B. So the correct answer must be B.
</think>

To estimate the gravitational force between the Earth and the Moon, we use Newton's law of universal gravitation:

\[
F = G \frac{M \cdot m}{r^2}
\]

### Given Data:
- \( M = 5.97 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg} \) (Mass of the Earth)
- \( m = 7.35 \times 10^{22} \, \text{kg} \) (Mass of the Moon)
- \( r = 3.84 \times 10^8 \, \text{m} \) (Distance between centers)
- \( G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{kg}^2 \) (Gravitational constant)

### Step 1: Approximate the calculation
To simplify, approximate the constants:
- \( G \approx 10^{-11} \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{kg}^2 \)
- \( M \approx 10^{24} \, \text{kg} \)
- \( m \approx 10^{22} \, \text{kg} \)
- \( r \approx 10^8 \, \text{m} \)

### Step 2: Compute the exponents
1. **Numerator**: \( G \cdot M \cdot m = (10^{-11}) \cdot (10^{24}) \cdot (10^{22}) = 10^{(-11 + 24 + 22)} = 10^{35} \)
2. **Denominator**: \( r^2 = (10^8)^2 = 10^{16} \)
3. **Force**: \( F = \frac{10^{35}}{10^{16}} = 10^{19} \, \text{N} \)

### Step 3: Verify the result
Using precise values for \( G \), \( M \), \( m \), and \( r \), the exact calculation yields approximately \( 2 \times 10^{20} \, \text{N} \). However, since the problem asks for an estimate and the options are rounded, the closest match is \( 10^{19} \, \text{N} \).

### Final Answer:
The best estimate for the gravitational force of the Earth on the Moon is **\( 10^{19} \, \text{N} \)**.

**Answer:** B
