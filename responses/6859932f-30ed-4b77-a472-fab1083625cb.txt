Okay, so I need to figure out between which two numbers the sum of 153 and 44 falls. Let's break this down step by step. 

First, I'll add the two numbers together. 153 plus 44. Let me do the addition carefully. 

Starting with the units place: 3 plus 4 is 7. Then the tens place: 5 plus 4 is 9. Finally, the hundreds place is just 1. So adding them up, 153 + 44 equals 197. 

Wait, let me double-check that. 153 plus 40 would be 193, and then adding 4 more gets me to 197. Yep, that seems right. 

Now, I need to see which range this sum falls into from the given options. The options are labeled A through J, each with a different range. 

Looking at the options:

A: 1,100-1,299  
B: 900-1,099  
C: 50-99  
D: 100-299  
E: 400-599  
F: 500-699  
G: 700-899  
H: 300-499  
I: 200-399  
J: 600-799  

So, 197 is the sum. Let's see where it fits. 

Starting from the lower options: C is 50-99, which is too low because 197 is higher. D is 100-299. 197 is within that range because 100 ≤ 197 ≤ 299. 

But wait, let me check the other options to make sure. Option I is 200-399. 197 is just below 200, so it doesn't fall into that. The next lower option is D: 100-299. 

Is there any option between 100 and 299 that includes 197? Yes, D is exactly that range. So the correct answer should be option D.

The sum of 153 and 44 is 197, which falls between 100 and 299. 

Answer: D
