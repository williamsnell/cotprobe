Question:

What is a One-to-One Assembler?

Options:

A: A One-to-One assembler translates each line of a machine word into an assembler language program
B: A One-to-One assembler translates two lines of an assembler language program into two machine words during assembly
C: A One-to-One assembler translates each line of an assembler language program into multiple machine words
D: A One-to-One assembler translates each line of an assembler language program into one machine word during assembly
E: A One-to-One assembler translates each machine word into multiple lines of an assembler language program
F: A One-to-One assembler requires manual intervention for each line of assembly to machine code translation
G: A One-to-One assembler compiles entire assembler language programs into a single executable machine word
H: A One-to-One assembler generates one line of machine code for every two lines of assembler language program
I: A One-to-One assembler translates each line of an assembler language program into a corresponding line in a high-level programming language
J: A One-to-One assembler translates multiple lines of an assembler language program into a single machine word

Okay, so I need to figure out what a One-to-One Assembler is. I remember from my computer science class that assemblers convert assembly language into machine code. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so let me think this through.

The question is asking about a "One-to-One Assembler." The term "one-to-one" probably refers to a direct, straightforward translation between each line of assembly code and the corresponding machine code. I think assemblers can be of different types—like one-pass, two-pass, etc.—but the one-to-one aspect is more about the ratio of assembly lines to machine words.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it translates each machine word into assembler. That sounds like a disassembler, not an assembler. So probably not A.

Option B: Translates two assembler lines into two machine words. Hmm, that's a one-to-one ratio as well, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, the key is whether each assembler line translates to one machine word, not necessarily the same number overall.

Option C: Each assembler line into multiple machine words. That would be a one-to-many scenario, which doesn't fit "one-to-one." So C is likely not the answer.

Option D: Each assembler line into one machine word. This sounds exactly like a one-to-one translation. Each line in assembly becomes exactly one machine word. That makes sense because each instruction in assembly typically corresponds to a single machine word (or opcode).

Option E: Translates each machine word into multiple assembler lines. Again, this is the reverse process, more like a disassembler, so E is probably not correct.

Option F: Requires manual intervention for each line. I don't think "one-to-one" implies manual work; assemblers automate this process. So F is unlikely.

Option G: Compiles entire programs into a single machine word. That sounds more like a compiler for a high-level language, not an assembler. Plus, a single machine word can't hold an entire program, so G is probably wrong.

Option H: Generates one machine code line for every two assembler lines. That's a one-to-two ratio, which isn't one-to-one. So H is out.

Option I: Translates assembler into a high-level language. That's a compiler's job, not an assembler's. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Multiple assembler lines into a single machine word. That's a many-to-one ratio, which is the opposite of one-to-one. So J isn't the answer.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be D because it's the only option that describes a one-to-one translation between each assembler line and a single machine word during assembly.

The One-to-One Assembler translates each line of an assembler language program into one machine word during assembly.
