Question:

TheAlforsCompany had a beginning inventory of $30,000, Jan 1, 1974. During the year, purchases amounted to $87,500, net sales to $102,000. Assuming that the gross profit rate is 40% of the net sales, what is the ending inventory using the gross profit method of inventory evaluation?

Okay, so I've got this question about The Alfors Company and their inventory. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question gives me some numbers. The beginning inventory on January 1, 1974, is $30,000. During the year, they made purchases totaling $87,500, and their net sales were $102,000. The gross profit rate is 40% of net sales, and I need to find the ending inventory using the gross profit method.

Wait, what's the gross profit method again? From what I remember, it's a way to estimate the ending inventory by assuming a certain gross profit margin. So, the idea is that you calculate the cost of goods sold (COGS) based on the gross profit rate, and then use that to find out how much inventory is left at the end of the period.

Let me jot down the formula. I think COGS is calculated as net sales minus the estimated gross profit. Since the gross profit rate is 40% of sales, the cost of goods sold would be 60% of sales because 100% minus 40% is 60%. Wait, no, hold on. Gross profit is calculated as (Sales - COGS), so if the gross profit is 40% of sales, then COGS is 60% of sales. Right, because if GP is 40%, that's 40% of sales, so COGS is the remaining 60%.

So, the first step is to calculate the COGS. Let's do that. Net sales are $102,000, and COGS is 60% of that. Let me calculate 60% of 102,000. 0.6 * 102,000 equals $61,200. So COGS is $61,200.

Next, I think the cost of goods available for sale is the sum of the beginning inventory and the purchases made during the year. So that's $30,000 (beginning) plus $87,500 (purchases). Let me add those together: 30k + 87.5k = $117,500. So the total goods available are $117,500.

Now, the ending inventory would be the cost of goods available minus the cost of goods sold. So that's $117,500 minus $61,200. Let me do that subtraction: 117,500 - 61,200 equals... 56,300? Wait, 117,500 minus 60,000 is 57,500, and then subtract 1,200 more would be 56,300. Yeah, that makes sense.

So the ending inventory should be $56,300. Now, looking at the options, option D is $56,300. So I think that's the correct answer.

Wait, did I do everything right? Let me just double-check. Gross profit rate is 40%, so GP is 40% of sales. So GP is 0.4 * 102,000 = $40,800. Then COGS is 102,000 - 40,800 = $61,200. Yep, that's correct. Then COGS available is 30k +87.5k=117.5k. Subtract COGS 61.2k, gives 56.3k. So D is right.

The ending inventory is calculated using the gross profit method. The cost of goods sold (COGS) is 60% of net sales ($102,000), which equals $61,200. The cost of goods available for sale is the sum of beginning inventory and purchases ($30,000 + $87,500 = $117,500). Subtracting COGS from this total gives the ending inventory: $117,500 - $61,200 = $56,300.

Answer: D
