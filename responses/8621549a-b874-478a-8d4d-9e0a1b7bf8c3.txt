Question:

The Federal Reserve's most important control instrument is open-market operations. How is it that selling government bonds can reduce bank reserves?

Options:

A: The bank will lose an equivalent amount of reserve balances with the Federal Reserve
B: The bank's reserve balances will become negative as a result of the bond sale
C: The bank's reserve balances increase due to interest payments on bonds
D: The bank will lose reserve balances only if the bonds are sold to the public, not to the Federal Reserve
E: The bank's reserve requirement ratio will decrease
F: The bank will gain more reserve balances
G: The bank's reserve balances will decrease by half the amount of the bonds sold
H: The bank's reserve balances will double
I: The bank's lending capacity will increase without any change in reserve balances
J: The bank's reserve balances remain unchanged

Okay, so I've got this question about the Federal Reserve and open-market operations. Hmm, I remember that open-market operations involve the Fed buying or selling government securities, like bonds, to influence the money supply and bank reserves. The question is asking specifically how selling government bonds reduces bank reserves.

Let me think. When the Fed sells bonds, they're selling them to banks or other financial institutions. So if a bank buys a bond from the Fed, the bank is essentially giving money to the Fed. Since the Fed is part of the central banking system, those funds are taken out of the bank's reserves. So the bank's reserve balance decreases because they've paid for the bond.

Looking at the options, option A says the bank loses an equivalent amount of reserve balances. That makes sense because the bank gives money to buy the bond, so their reserves go down by that amount.

Option B says reserves become negative, but I don't think that's right. Banks can't have negative reserves in this context; they just lose what they spent on the bond.

Option C suggests reserves increase due to interest, but when the Fed sells bonds, they're not giving out interest to banks. The interest from bonds is more about the return on investment, not affecting reserves directly.

Option D says reserves are lost only if sold to the public. But the Fed sells bonds to banks too, so D doesn't seem correct.

Option E talks about the reserve requirement ratio decreasing, but selling bonds doesn't change that ratio; it's a separate tool.

Option F says reserves increase, which is the opposite of what's happening. The bank is losing money when they buy the bond.

Option G says reserves decrease by half the bond amount. I don't recall that being the case; it's a direct equivalent.

Option H suggests reserves double, which doesn't make sense in this scenario.

Option I claims lending capacity increases without changing reserves, but if reserves decrease, banks can't lend as much, so I is incorrect.

Option J says reserves remain unchanged, which contradicts the whole point of selling bonds to reduce them.

So the correct answer should be A.

The Federal Reserve sells government bonds to banks, which reduces the banks' reserves because they are transferring money to the Fed.
