Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Hourdequin's critique of consequentialist calculation. I'm a bit rusty on my ethics, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Okay, the question is asking what flaw Hourdequin identifies with consequentialist calculation. The options are A through J. I remember that consequentialism is a theory that suggests the morality of an action is determined by its consequences, particularly the overall good it produces. So, for example, utilitarianism is a form of consequentialism where the goal is to maximize utility or happiness.

Now, looking at the options, each is suggesting a different flaw. I need to figure out which one aligns with what Hourdequin argues. I think I remember that one criticism of consequentialism is that it might not account well for individual rationality or autonomy. But let me go through each option to be sure.

Option A: It negates that individuals are inherently self-interested. Hmm, does consequentialism say people aren't self-interested? I don't think so. It might say that people's self-interest should be considered in the overall consequences, but I don't think it negates it. So maybe not A.

Option B: It can run counter to the idea that persons are atomistic and individually rational. Atomistic meaning individuals are separate and self-contained. Consequentialism might require looking at the big picture, so maybe it overlooks individual rationality. I'm not sure yet.

Option C: It overlooks the conflict between individual and collective interests. That sounds familiar. I recall that some critics say consequentialism can ignore how individual actions might conflict with the greater good, or perhaps it doesn't handle individual vs. collective well. But I'm not certain if this is what Hourdequin points out.

Option D: It can run counter to a person's ability to integrate commitments at various levels. This is a bit abstract. Integrating commitments might mean considering different levels of moral decision-making, like personal, professional, societal. If consequentialism focuses only on outcomes, maybe it doesn't allow for this integration. Possible, but I'm not sure.

Option E: It fails to reconcile prima facie duties. Prima facie duties are initial obligations that might conflict. Consequentialism might prioritize outcomes over duties, so perhaps it doesn't reconcile these. But I'm not sure if this is the specific point Hourdequin makes.

Option F: It doesn't consider individuals acting against self-interest. Wait, doesn't consequentialism often say that acting for the greater good might require acting against self-interest? So if the question is about a flaw, maybe it's the opposite. If the theory doesn't allow for people to act against their self-interest, that could be a problem, but I think it's more about the calculation aspect.

Option G: It undermines personal values and beliefs. Consequentialism might prioritize outcomes over personal values, but I'm not sure if that's the main flaw Hourdequin points out.

Option H: It disregards social norms. Social norms do affect decisions, but I'm not sure if this is the main issue with consequentialist calculations.

Option I: It fails to recognize that persons are best understood in relation to one another. This seems related to individualism vs. relational understanding. Consequentialism might focus on outcomes without considering the relationships between people, which could be a flaw.

Option J: It discredits morally autonomous decisions. If the theory requires calculating the best outcome, it might undermine individual autonomy by not allowing people to make their own moral choices. But I'm not certain.

Wait, I think the key here is that Hourdequin is arguing against a flaw in the calculation process of consequentialism. From what I remember, one critique is that it doesn't allow for individuals to integrate their commitments across different levels. For example, someone might have personal, professional, and societal commitments, and integrating them requires considering how each level affects the others. If you're just calculating consequences, you might miss the nuances of how these different levels interact.

Looking back at the options, D says it can run counter to a person's being able to integrate her commitments at various levels. That seems to fit. Alternatively, I thought C was about individual vs. collective, but maybe D is more about the integration aspect.

Another angle: atomistic individuals are considered separate, each making rational decisions. If consequentialism requires looking at overall consequences, it might not respect the individual's ability to make decisions based on their own rationality and commitments. So B says it runs counter to the idea of atomistic, individually rational actors. That could be another angle.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Atomistic individuals are self-contained, each acting rationally. If consequentialism doesn't allow for that because it requires considering everyone's actions for the greater good, then B might be the answer. But I'm not sure if that's what Hourdequin says.

Alternatively, D is about integrating commitments, which might mean that the theory doesn't allow individuals to consider their various roles and responsibilities, which could be a flaw. That makes sense because if you're just calculating the best outcome, you might not account for the different levels of commitment a person has.

I think I'm leaning towards D now because it's about the integration of commitments, which is a more specific critique related to how individuals make decisions considering various aspects of their lives. So, the flaw is that it doesn't allow for integrating these commitments, making decision-making more complex and perhaps less aligned with how real people make choices.

The flaw Hourdequin identifies with consequentialist calculation is that it can run counter to a person's ability to integrate her commitments at various levels, as it may not account for the nuances of different roles and responsibilities in decision-making. 

Answer: D
