First, determine the number of straws used for the initial 9 shapes. Since each shape requires 5 straws, multiply 9 by 5 to get 45 straws.

Next, add the additional 15 straws Conor used to make more shapes to the initial 45 straws. This gives a total of 60 straws.

Therefore, the total number of straws Conor used is 60.

To determine the total number of straws Conor used, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of straws used for the initial 9 shapes:**
   
   \[
   9 \text{ shapes} \times 5 \text{ straws per shape} = 45 \text{ straws}
   \]

2. **Add the additional 15 straws Conor used:**
   
   \[
   45 \text{ straws} + 15 \text{ straws} = 60 \text{ straws}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of straws Conor used to make all the shapes is **60**.

**Answer:** A
