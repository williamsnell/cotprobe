Okay, so I need to figure out the product of 5.7 multiplied by 8 using the Distributive Property mentally. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the Distributive Property is a way to break down multiplication into smaller, more manageable parts. It's usually in the form a(b + c) = ab + ac. So, maybe I can split 5.7 into two numbers that are easier to multiply by 8.

Wait, 5.7 can be thought of as 5 + 0.7. That makes sense. So, applying the Distributive Property, I can write 5.7 * 8 as (5 + 0.7) * 8. Which would then be 5*8 + 0.7*8.

Let me calculate each part separately. 5 multiplied by 8 is 40. That's straightforward. Then, 0.7 multiplied by 8. Hmm, 0.7 is like seven-tenths, so 7*8 is 56, and since it's tenths, it's 5.6. So, 0.7*8 equals 5.6.

Now, adding those two results together: 40 (from 5*8) plus 5.6 (from 0.7*8). 40 + 5.6 equals 45.6. So, the product should be 45.6.

Looking at the options, I see option E is 45.6. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 5*8 is 40, 0.7*8 is 5.6, adding them gives 45.6. Yep, that seems right. I don't think I made any calculation errors there.

The product of 5.7 multiplied by 8 using the Distributive Property is calculated as (5 + 0.7) * 8 = 40 + 5.6 = 45.6. 

Answer: E
