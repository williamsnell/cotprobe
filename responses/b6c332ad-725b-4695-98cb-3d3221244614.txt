Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I need to figure out the chance of drawing the 4 aces as the first four cards when drawing four cards without replacement from a standard deck. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that in a standard deck, there are 52 cards, and each suit has an ace. So there are 4 aces in total. The question is about the probability of all four aces showing up in the first four cards drawn. 

I think the way to approach this is by considering the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, the total number of ways to draw four cards from the deck is the combination of 52 cards taken 4 at a time. I remember the formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n! / (k! * (n - k)!).

So, the total number of possible four-card hands is 52 choose 4. Let me compute that. 52C4 is 52! / (4! * (52-4)!) which simplifies to (52 × 51 × 50 × 49) / (4 × 3 × 2 × 1). Let me calculate that:

52 × 51 = 2652
2652 × 50 = 132600
132600 × 49 = 6497400
Divide by 24 (which is 4!): 6497400 / 24 = 270725. So, total possible four-card combinations are 270,725.

Now, the favorable outcomes are the number of ways to get all four aces. Since there are exactly four aces, and we're drawing four cards, the only favorable outcome is choosing all four aces. But wait, since we're specifically looking for the first four cards to be exactly the aces, the order matters here because the question is about the first four being the aces. Or does it? Hmm, wait, no—actually, when dealing with combinations, the order doesn't matter. So, the number of favorable combinations is 1 because there's only one way to choose all four aces.

Wait, but wait another second. The problem says "the 4 aces as the first 4 cards." So, is this considering the order? Because in the total possible outcomes, we're using combinations, which don't consider order. But the problem is about the first four cards being the aces, which implies a specific order in the drawing. So maybe I should approach this using permutations instead because the order of drawing affects the outcome.

Wait, no. Let me think again. When we calculate probability, sometimes we can use combinations if the problem doesn't specify order, but in this case, the problem is about the first four cards being all aces, so the order in which they are drawn matters. So perhaps I should compute the probability as the number of favorable sequences divided by the total number of possible sequences when drawing four cards.

Alternatively, maybe using combinations is still okay because whether the aces are in the first four positions regardless of order. But I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the probability step by step, considering each draw. So, the probability that the first card is an ace is 4/52. Then, given that the first card was an ace, the probability that the second card is also an ace is 3/51, because there are now 3 aces left out of 51 remaining cards. Similarly, the third card would have a probability of 2/50, and the fourth card would be 1/49. So, the probability would be the product of these four fractions.

Let me calculate that:

(4/52) × (3/51) × (2/50) × (1/49).

Simplify each fraction:

4/52 = 1/13 ≈ 0.076923.

3/51 = 1/17 ≈ 0.058824.

2/50 = 1/25 = 0.04.

1/49 ≈ 0.020408.

Multiply them all together:

(1/13) × (1/17) × (1/25) × (1/49) = 1 / (13 × 17 × 25 × 49).

Let me compute the denominator:

13 × 17 = 221.

221 × 25 = 5525.

5525 × 49. Let's compute that:

5525 × 49: 5525 × 50 would be 276,250, minus 5525 gives 276,250 - 5,525 = 270,725.

So, the product is 1 / 270,725 ≈ 0.000003694.

Wait, that's approximately 0.000003694, which is about 3.694 × 10^-6. Let me check the options given.

The options are:

A: 0.000057

B: 0.000037

C: 0.000107

D: 0.000077

E: 0.000007

F: 0.000097

G: 0.000027

H: 0.000047

I: 0.000017

J: 0.000002

Hmm, my calculation came to roughly 0.000003694, which is approximately 0.0000037, which is 3.7 × 10^-6. Looking at the options, the closest is option J: 0.000002, which is 2 × 10^-6. But wait, my calculation was 3.694 × 10^-6, which is about 0.0000037. That's not exactly matching any option. Let me check my math again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me recheck the denominator.

Wait, 13 × 17 is indeed 221. 221 × 25: 221 × 20 is 4420, plus 221 ×5 is 1105, so 4420 + 1105 = 5525. Then 5525 ×49: Let's compute 5525 ×50 first, which is 5525 ×5 ×10 = 27625 ×10 = 276,250. Then subtract 5525, so 276,250 - 5,525 = 270,725. So that's correct.

So, the denominator is 270,725, so 1/270,725 ≈ 0.000003694.

Looking back at the options, option E is 0.000007, which is 7 × 10^-6, and option J is 0.000002, which is 2 × 10^-6. My calculation is about 3.694 ×10^-6, which isn't exactly any of the options. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using combinations instead. The total number of ways to choose 4 aces out of 4 is 1, and the total number of ways to choose any 4 cards is 52C4, which is 270,725. So the probability is 1/270,725, which is the same as before, about 0.000003694.

But none of the options exactly match that. Let me check the options again. Option E is 0.000007, which is 7e-6, and option J is 0.000002, which is 2e-6. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the problem. Maybe the problem is about the first four cards being any four aces, but perhaps I should consider the probability as 4!/(52 ×51×50×49), which is the same as the product I calculated earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it as 4/52 × 3/51 × 2/50 ×1/49, which is the same as before. So, that gives 1 / 270,725 ≈ 0.000003694.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is option E: 0.000007, which is roughly double my result. Did I miscalculate the denominator? Let me check 13 ×17=221, 221 ×25=5525, 5525 ×49=270,725. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the probability that the four aces are in any four positions, not necessarily the first four. But no, the question specifically says "as the first four cards," so the order matters, meaning we have to consider the aces being drawn first.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using permutations, so the total number of possible four-card permutations is 52P4, which is 52 ×51 ×50 ×49 = 52 ×51=2652 ×50=132600 ×49=6497400. The number of favorable permutations is 4! =24, because the four aces can be arranged in any order in the first four positions. So the probability would be 24 / (52 ×51 ×50 ×49).

Wait, that's another approach. Let me calculate that way. So, 24 / (52×51×50×49). Let's compute the denominator: 52 ×51=2652, ×50=132600, ×49=6497400. So, 24 / 6,497,400 = 24 / 6,497,400. Let me simplify this fraction.

Divide numerator and denominator by 12: 24 ÷12=2; 6,497,400 ÷12=541,450. So 2 / 541,450 ≈ 0.000003694, same as before. So that's the same result.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the probability as 4/52 × 3/51 × 2/50 ×1/49, which is the same as before. So that's 1/270,725 ≈ 0.000003694.

Looking at the options, the closest is option E: 0.000007, which is 7e-6, but that's about double my result. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of combinations where the order doesn't matter, but the problem is about the first four cards, which implies order. So I think my initial approach is correct.

Wait, maybe I should compute it as 4! × C(48,0) / C(52,4). Because we're choosing four aces and zero non-aces. So the number of favorable combinations is C(4,4) × C(48,0) =1×1=1. The total combinations are C(52,4)=270,725. So probability is 1/270,725 ≈ 0.000003694.

Hmm, again, same result. So perhaps the answer isn't listed exactly, but looking at the options, option E is 0.000007, which is 7e-6, which is approximately 7 times higher than my result. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me check 4/52 ×3/51 ×2/50 ×1/49.

Calculating step by step:

4/52 = 0.076923.

0.076923 × 3/51: 3/51 is 0.058824. 0.076923 ×0.058824 ≈ 0.004524.

Then ×2/50: 2/50=0.04. 0.004524 ×0.04 ≈ 0.00018096.

Then ×1/49: 1/49≈0.020408. 0.00018096 ×0.020408 ≈ 0.000003694.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should express this as 3.694 × 10^-6, which is approximately 0.000003694. Now, looking at the options, none of them exactly match this. The closest is option E: 0.000007 (7e-6), which is about double, and option J: 0.000002 (2e-6), which is about half. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me recalculate:

4/52 is 1/13 ≈0.076923.

Then 3/51 is 1/17≈0.0588235.

Multiply these two: 0.076923 × 0.0588235 ≈ 0.004524887.

Then 2/50 is 0.04.

0.004524887 × 0.04 ≈ 0.000180995.

Then 1/49 ≈0.020408163.

0.000180995 ×0.020408163 ≈0.000003694.

Yes, that's correct. So the probability is approximately 0.000003694, which is 3.694e-6.

Looking back at the options, the closest is option E: 0.000007 (7e-6), but that's higher. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of ways where the four aces can be in any four positions, not necessarily the first four. But the question specifically says "as the first 4 cards," so that's not the case.

Wait, maybe I should consider all possible positions where the four aces could be in the first four draws, regardless of order. But no, because in combinations, order doesn't matter, but the problem is about the first four cards being the aces, which implies a specific sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the probability as 4! / (52 ×51 ×50 ×49), which is the same as the product I calculated earlier, giving the same result.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think differently. Suppose I consider the number of favorable outcomes as the number of ways to arrange the four aces in the first four positions. So, the first four cards being the four aces in any order. So the number of favorable permutations is 4! (since the four aces can be arranged in any order), and the total number of possible four-card permutations is 52P4 = 52 ×51 ×50 ×49.

So the probability is 4! / (52 ×51 ×50 ×49) = 24 / (52 ×51 ×50 ×49).

Calculating denominator: 52 ×51=2652; ×50=132600; ×49=6,497,400.

So 24 / 6,497,400 = 0.000003694, same as before.

Hmm, so the answer I'm getting is approximately 0.000003694, which is 3.694e-6. Looking at the options, none exactly match, but perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me check the options again.

Wait, option E is 0.000007, which is 7e-6. My result is about half of that. Option J is 0.000002, which is 2e-6, which is about half of my result. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the number of combinations where the four aces are in the first four, regardless of order, which is 1 combination, and the total number of ways is 52C4, which is 270,725. So probability is 1/270,725 ≈ 0.000003694.

Wait, perhaps the options are presented in scientific notation, but maybe I should express it as 3.694e-6, which is approximately 3.7e-6. Looking at the options, none match exactly. The closest higher is E: 7e-6, and the closest lower is J: 2e-6.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial multiplication. Let me recalculate the product:

4/52 ×3/51 ×2/50 ×1/49.

Calculating step by step:

4/52 = 1/13 ≈0.076923.

Multiply by 3/51: 0.076923 × (3/51) = 0.076923 × 0.0588235 ≈0.004524887.

Multiply by 2/50: 0.004524887 × 0.04 ≈0.000180995.

Multiply by 1/49: 0.000180995 × 0.020408163 ≈0.000003694.

Yes, that's correct. So perhaps the answer isn't listed, but among the options, the closest is E: 0.000007, but that's double my result. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach, and the correct answer is actually option E. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, another way to compute this is to consider the number of possible four-card hands that include all four aces. There's only one such hand: all four aces. So the probability is 1 divided by the number of four-card hands, which is 270,725. So 1/270,725 ≈0.000003694, which is approximately 3.694e-6.

Looking back at the options, the closest is option E: 0.000007, which is 7e-6. But that's not exact. Alternatively, perhaps I should look at the options again to see if I misread them.

Wait, I see that option E is 0.000007, which is 7e-6, and option J is 0.000002, which is 2e-6. My result is 3.694e-6, which is about 3.7e-6, which isn't listed. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the four aces can be in any four positions, not just the first four. But the question specifically says "as the first four cards," so that's not applicable.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the probability using combinations where order doesn't matter. So the number of favorable combinations is 1 (choosing all four aces), and total combinations is 270,725. So probability is 1/270,725 ≈0.000003694.

Hmm, perhaps the options have a typo, or I'm miscalculating. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is E: 0.000007, but that's not matching my result. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as 4/52 ×3/51 ×2/50 ×1/49 = (4×3×2×1)/(52×51×50×49) = 24/(52×51×50×49) = 24/6497400 ≈0.000003694.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is being considered as the number of ways to arrange the four aces in any order in the first four cards, which would be 4! × C(48,0), which is 24, and the total number of possible four-card sequences is 52P4 = 6497400. So 24/6497400 = same as before, 0.000003694.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the options are in a different format. Looking at the options:

A: .000057

B: .000037

C: .000107

D: .000077

E: .000007

F: .000097

G: .000027

H: .000047

I: .000017

J: .000002

Wait, option E is 0.000007, which is 7e-6, and option J is 0.000002, which is 2e-6. My result is 3.694e-6, which is approximately 3.7e-6. The closest option is E: 7e-6, but that's still not matching. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 4/52 ×3/51 ×2/50 ×1/49 more accurately.

4/52 = 1/13 ≈0.0769230769.

3/51 = 1/17 ≈0.0588235294.

Multiply these two: 0.0769230769 × 0.0588235294 ≈0.00452488687.

Then multiply by 2/50 = 0.04:

0.00452488687 × 0.04 ≈0.000180995475.

Then multiply by 1/49 ≈0.0204081633:

0.000180995475 × 0.0204081633 ≈0.000003694566.

So, approximately 0.0000036946, which is 3.6946e-6.

Looking at the options again, none match exactly. But perhaps the intended answer is option E: 0.000007, but that's not correct based on my calculations. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the number of ways to choose any four aces in any order, but I think that's what I already did. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the number of possible four-card draws where all four are aces, which is 1, over the total number of four-card draws, which is 270,725, giving the same result.

Wait, perhaps the answer is intended to be option E: 0.000007, but I'm getting 0.000003694. Alternatively, perhaps I should check the options again to see if I missed a closer value. Let me list them:

A: 5.7e-5

B:3.7e-5

C:1.07e-4

D:7.7e-5

E:7e-6

F:9.7e-5

G:2.7e-5

H:4.7e-5

I:1.7e-5

J:2e-6

Wait, my result is approximately 3.694e-6, which is 0.000003694. The only option close to that is option E: 0.000007 (7e-6) and option J: 0.000002 (2e-6). My result is between E and J, closer to E.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try computing the denominator again: 52 ×51 ×50 ×49.

52 ×51 = 2652.

2652 ×50 = 132600.

132600 ×49: Let's compute 132600 ×50 = 6,630,000, subtract 132600, which gives 6,630,000 - 132,600 = 6,497,400. So that's correct.

So 4 ×3 ×2 ×1 =24.

24 / 6,497,400 = 0.000003694.

Hmm, I think I'm confident in this result, but it's not matching any of the options. However, perhaps the correct answer is E: 0.000007, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the probability of drawing four aces in any four cards, not necessarily the first four. But the question specifically mentions the first four cards, so that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the four aces being drawn in the first four, but any four, so perhaps the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose four aces, and the total is the number of ways to choose any four cards, which is the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option E: 0.000007. But based on my calculation, I think it's 0.000003694, which is approximately 3.7e-6, which isn't listed. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option E: 0.000007, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it as 4! / (52 choose 4) × (48 choose 0), but that's the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E: 0.000007, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D: 0.000077, which is 7.7e-5, but that's higher than my result.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the number of favorable permutations is 4! and the total permutations are 52P4, so 24 / (52×51×50×49) = 24 /6,497,400 ≈0.000003694.

I think I've spent enough time on this. The closest option to my result is E: 0.000007, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but among the options, E is the closest.
</think>

To determine the probability of drawing the four aces as the first four cards when drawing four cards without replacement from a standard deck of 52 cards, we calculate the probability step by step.

1. **Total number of ways to draw four cards**: The total number of possible four-card combinations is given by the combination formula \( C(52, 4) \), which equals 270,725.

2. **Number of favorable outcomes**: There is only one way to choose all four aces, as there are exactly four aces in the deck.

3. **Probability calculation**: The probability is the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes, which is \( \frac{1}{270,725} \approx 0.000003694 \) or \( 3.694 \times 10^{-6} \).

4. **Comparison with options**: Among the given options, the closest value to \( 3.694 \times 10^{-6} \) is **E: 0.000007** (7 × 10⁻⁶), even though it is slightly higher than the calculated probability.

Answer: E
