Question:

A 47-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 2 hours after the sudden onset of shortness of breath, severe chest pain, and sweating. He has no history of similar symptoms. He has hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years. His pulse is 110/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 110/50 mm Hg. A grade 3/6, diastolic blowing murmur is heard over the left sternal border and radiates to the right sternal border. Femoral pulses are decreased bilaterally. An ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A: Acute myocardial infarction
B: Congestive heart failure
C: Angina pectoris
D: Aortic dissection
E: Mitral valve prolapse
F: Esophageal rupture
G: Hypertensive crisis
H: Thoracic aortic aneurysm
I: Pulmonary embolism
J: Aortic stenosis

Alright, I'm trying to figure out the correct diagnosis for this patient. Let me go through the information step by step.

The patient is a 47-year-old man with sudden onset of shortness of breath, severe chest pain, and sweating. He has no prior history of similar symptoms, which might suggest this is a new issue. His medical history includes hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide, and he's a 30-pack-year smoker. That's significant because smoking increases the risk of several cardiovascular issues, like atherosclerosis or aneurysms.

His vital signs are pulse 110/min, respiratory rate 24/min, and BP 110/50 mm Hg. The low blood pressure here stands out. He's hypotensive, which could indicate something like shock, maybe from a cardiac cause or aortic issues.

On physical exam, there's a grade 3/6 diastolic blowing murmur over the left sternal border that radiates to the right. That murmur is concerning. Diastolic murmurs often relate to mitral regurgitation or aortic stenosis, but the radiation to the right sternal border makes me think aortic issues because aortic regurgitation or dissection can produce such murmurs. Also, decreased femoral pulses bilaterally could indicate aortic insufficiency or aortic dissection, as the aorta supplies those pulses. In aortic dissection, the pulse might be weak or absent in extremities due to aortic narrowing or occlusion.

The ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy, which can occur in conditions that put strain on the left ventricle, like hypertension, aortic stenosis, or aortic dissection. 

Let's consider the options:

A: Acute myocardial infarction (MI) – Possible, but the symptoms here don't perfectly fit. He doesn't have typical angina radiation, and the murmur and hypotension are more indicative of something else. Also, his blood pressure is low, which is unusual in an MI unless it's cardiogenic shock.

B: Congestive heart failure (CHF) – He has LVH, but the sudden onset and the signs like murmurs and decreased pulses point more towards a structural issue rather than CHF.

C: Angina pectoris – Unlikely because it's usually substernal pain radiating to the arm or jaw, not sudden onset with other signs like murmurs and hypotension.

D: Aortic dissection – This seems high on the list. The chest pain is sudden and severe, the hypotension could be due to aortic compromise, the murmur might be from aortic insufficiency or a tear, and the decreased pulses suggest possible aortic involvement.

E: Mitral valve prolapse – Typically presents with a click-murmur sound, not a diastolic blowing murmur that radiates to the right. Plus, the other signs don't fit as well.

F: Esophageal rupture – This is rare and usually presents with dysphagia and mediastinitis, not the symptoms described here.

G: Hypertensive crisis – More about extremely high blood pressure, not a sudden drop. Plus, the symptoms and exam don't align with this.

H: Thoracic aortic aneurysm – Could be possible, but the sudden chest pain and signs point more towards acute issues like dissection rather than a chronic aneurysm.

I: Pulmonary embolism – This can cause sudden breathlessness and chest pain, but the absence of risk factors like deep vein thrombosis, and the presence of murmurs and low BP make this less likely.

J: Aortic stenosis – Typically causes a harsh, crescendo-decrescendo murmur in the aortic area, not a blowing diastolic one. Also, aortic stenosis would usually present with angina and syncope, not the hypotension here.

Putting it all together, the most likely diagnosis is aortic dissection (Option D). The combination of sudden chest pain, hypotension, diastolic murmur, and decreased femoral pulses strongly suggests this condition.

The patient's presentation, including sudden chest pain, hypotension, diastolic murmur, and decreased femoral pulses, strongly suggests aortic dissection. 

Answer: D
