Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the smallest positive integer that meets three specific remainder conditions when divided by 3, 5, and 7. The options are given from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me understand the problem again. I'm looking for a number, let's call it N, such that:

1. When N is divided by 3, the remainder is 2. So mathematically, that's N ≡ 2 mod 3.
2. When N is divided by 5, the remainder is 3. So N ≡ 3 mod 5.
3. When N is divided by 7, the remainder is 1. So N ≡ 1 mod 7.

I need to find the smallest positive integer that satisfies all three conditions. The options are A:8, B:31, C:10, D:37, E:23, F:12, G:14, H:52, I:15, J:26.

Hmm, okay. So maybe I can approach this by checking each option to see which one fits all three conditions. Alternatively, I could try solving the system of congruences using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, but since the numbers are small, checking each option might be quicker.

Let me list the options again for clarity:

A:8
B:31
C:10
D:37
E:23
F:12
G:14
H:52
I:15
J:26

I think I'll check each one against the three conditions.

Starting with option A: 8.

Check N=8:

1. 8 divided by 3: 3*2=6, remainder 2. So yes, 8 ≡2 mod3. Good.
2. 8 divided by 5: 5*1=5, remainder 3. So 8≡3 mod5. Good.
3. 8 divided by 7: 7*1=7, remainder 1. So 8≡1 mod7. Perfect. So 8 meets all three conditions. But wait, is there a smaller number than 8? The problem asks for the smallest positive integer. Let me think: numbers less than 8. Let's see if any number less than 8 satisfies all three conditions.

Wait, let me make sure. I'm checking 8, which is option A. But wait, let me check all options because maybe I made a mistake. Because sometimes when you think you found it, you might have skipped something.

Wait, but 8 is the first option, and it's the smallest number in the options. Let me see if any number smaller than 8 meets all conditions.

Wait, let's think: The number must be 2 mod3, so possible numbers are 2,5,8,11,14, etc.

Numbers that are 3 mod5: 3,8,13,18, etc.

Numbers that are 1 mod7:1,8,15,22, etc.

Looking for the smallest number that's common to all three lists.

Looking at the intersection:

From 2 mod3: 2,5,8,11,14,17,20,23,26,29,32,35,38,41,44,47,50,53,56,59,62,65,68,71,74,77,80,83,86,89,92,95,98,...

From 3 mod5:3,8,13,18,23,28,33,38,43,48,53,58,63,68,73,78,83,88,93,98,...

From 1 mod7:1,8,15,22,29,36,43,50,57,64,71,78,85,92,99,...

So looking for the smallest common number in all three. The first common number is 8. So yes, 8 is the smallest positive integer that satisfies all three conditions. But wait, the options include 8 as option A, which would be the correct answer. But wait, I'm confused because the options also include 31, which is the next number in some of these sequences. Hmm, perhaps I should double-check.

Wait, but 8 is indeed the smallest number that appears in all three lists. So why is 31 one of the options? Maybe I made a mistake in checking the options. Let me check each option again.

Option A:8.

Check all three conditions:

8 ÷3=2 rem2. Correct.

8 ÷5=1 rem3. Correct.

8 ÷7=1 rem1. Correct. So 8 is correct.

Wait, then why is 31 there? Maybe because 8 is the correct answer, and 31 is another number that satisfies the conditions but is larger. So in the options, 8 is the smallest. So the answer should be A:8.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option A is 8, which fits all the conditions. So why is the correct answer not A?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the problem again. The question is to find the smallest positive integer that leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, 3 when divided by 5, and 1 when divided by 7.

So N ≡2 mod3, N≡3 mod5, N≡1 mod7.

So 8 meets all three. So it's the correct answer. Therefore, option A is correct.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because sometimes when you think you have the answer, you might overlook something. Let me check again.

Another approach: Let's solve the system of congruences.

We have:

N ≡2 mod3.

N ≡3 mod5.

N ≡1 mod7.

We can solve this step by step.

First, solve the first two congruences.

Find N such that N ≡2 mod3 and N≡3 mod5.

Let me represent N as 3k +2, where k is an integer.

Substitute into the second congruence: 3k +2 ≡3 mod5.

So 3k ≡1 mod5.

We can solve for k: 3k ≡1 mod5.

Multiplicative inverse of 3 mod5 is 2 because 3*2=6≡1 mod5.

So k ≡2*1 ≡2 mod5.

So k=5m +2, where m is an integer.

So N=3*(5m+2)+2=15m +6 +2=15m +8.

So N ≡8 mod15.

Now, we have N=15m +8, and we need to satisfy N≡1 mod7.

So substitute into the third congruence:

15m +8 ≡1 mod7.

Simplify 15 mod7: 15 ÷7=2*7=14, remainder 1. So 15 ≡1 mod7.

So 15m +8 ≡ m +1 mod7 ≡1 mod7.

So m +1 ≡1 mod7.

Subtract 1: m ≡0 mod7.

So m=7n, where n is an integer.

So N=15*(7n)+8=105n +8.

So the smallest positive integer is when n=0: N=8.

So yes, 8 is the solution.

Therefore, the correct answer is A:8.

The smallest positive integer that satisfies all three conditions is 8, which corresponds to option A.
