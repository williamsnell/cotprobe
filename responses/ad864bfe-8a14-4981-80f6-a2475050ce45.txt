Question:

Defendant was waiting in line for post-Thanksgiving day sales. The door opened at 6 a.m. and hundreds of people rushed the entrance for a chance at a hugely discounted holiday gift. When defendant saw that there was a signed copy of a book written by his mother's favorite author, he jumped towards it, only to be blocked by a little old lady with a baseball bat. She was using the bat as a blocking tool, but he was determined to get the book, so he deliberately stuck his leg out in front of her and tripped her. She fell hard and in the process ended up with a blood clot in her leg, which traveled to her heart over a period of weeks, and ultimately caused her death. What crime can the defendant likely be convicted of?

Options:

A: Battery
B: First degree murder
C: Premeditated murder
D: Involuntary manslaughter
E: Second degree murder
F: Aggravated assault
G: Third degree murder
H: No crime, it was a accident.
I: voluntary manslaughter

Okay, so I've got this question about criminal law, and I need to figure out what crime the defendant can be convicted of. Let me read it carefully and break it down.

So, the scenario is that it's post-Thanksgiving sales, and the store opens at 6 a.m. Hundreds of people rush in. The defendant was waiting in line, and when he saw a signed copy of a book by his mother's favorite author, he jumped towards it. But there was a little old lady blocking him with a baseball bat. He tried to trip her on purpose, and she fell hard. This caused a blood clot in her leg, which traveled to her heart and led to her death.

Hmm, the question is asking what crime the defendant can be convicted of. The options are from A to I, including things like battery, murder degrees, manslaughter, etc.

First, I need to think about the elements of each crime. Let's consider each option.

A: Battery. Battery is typically an intentional harmful or offensive touching. Here, the defendant tripped the old lady, causing her to fall. That's a harmful contact, so battery might apply. But battery is usually a misdemeanor unless it's more serious.

B: First degree murder. This requires premeditation and deliberation. Did the defendant plan to kill her? It seems he was trying to get the book and tripped her, but I don't think he intended to kill her. So maybe not first degree.

C: Premeditated murder. Same as first degree, so probably not.

D: Involuntary manslaughter. This is when someone dies due to the defendant's criminal negligence or during the commission of a misdemeanor. Here, the defendant's act of tripping her could be considered criminally negligent, especially if he acted recklessly in a crowded and chaotic situation.

E: Second degree murder. This is intentional killing without premeditation, like in a heat of passion. But did he have the intent to kill? It seems more like he intended to trip her, not to kill.

F: Aggravated assault. This is an assault with a weapon or causing serious bodily injury. He used his leg to trip her, but it's not clear if it's an assault with a weapon. But the result was serious—death, so maybe.

G: Third degree murder. This is when someone dies during the commission of a felony, but the felony isn't inherently violent. Wait, but in some jurisdictions, third-degree murder is a category for deaths caused by reckless behavior, regardless of intent. Hmm.

H: No crime, it was an accident. But he deliberately tripped her, so it's not an accident; he acted intentionally, even if he didn't intend to kill her.

I: Voluntary manslaughter. This is intentional killing in the heat of passion or self-defense. He didn't kill her intentionally, so probably not.

So, focusing on D and G. Involuntary manslaughter is about criminal negligence causing death. Did the defendant act with such negligence? He was in a rush, tripped her with a baseball bat, leading to her death. That seems like criminal negligence.

Alternatively, third-degree murder might apply if the jurisdiction defines it as causing death through reckless conduct. But I think involuntary manslaughter is more likely here because it's about the result of his actions, which were likely negligent.

Wait, but battery could also be a misdemeanor, and if during the commission of a misdemeanor someone dies, it could be involuntary manslaughter. So if the tripping was battery, and that led to her death, then involuntary manslaughter applies.

Also, the fact that she died weeks later because of the blood clot—proximate cause. The defendant's action was the cause of her death, so the manslaughter charge would stand.

So, the likely answer is D: Involuntary manslaughter.

The defendant's deliberate act of tripping the old lady, which resulted in her death, constitutes criminal negligence. This fits the elements of involuntary manslaughter, as her death occurred during the commission of a misdemeanor (battery) and due to reckless behavior. 

Answer: D
