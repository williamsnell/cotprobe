Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about water droplets and pressure. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking: What diameter must a water droplet have at 20°C so that the pressure inside it is 1.0 kPa greater than outside. The options are from A to J, with various millimeters.

Hmm, I remember that when a liquid forms a droplet, the pressure inside is higher than outside due to surface tension. The pressure difference is called the Laplace pressure. The formula for Laplace pressure is ΔP = 2γ / r, where γ is the surface tension and r is the radius of the droplet.

Wait, so the problem gives me ΔP as 1.0 kPa. I think I need to rearrange the formula to solve for r. Let me write that down:

ΔP = 2γ / r  
So, r = 2γ / ΔP

I need to find r, then double it to get the diameter d. But first, I need the surface tension of water at 20°C. I remember that water's surface tension is around 72 mN/m at 20°C. Let me confirm that. Yeah, I think that's right. So γ = 0.072 N/m.

Now, plugging the values into the equation:

ΔP is 1.0 kPa, which is 1000 Pa. So,

r = (2 * 0.072) / 1000  
r = 0.144 / 1000  
r = 0.000144 meters. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 0.072 times 2 is 0.144, divided by 1000 is 0.000144 meters, which is 0.144 mm. Wait, no, wait: 0.000144 meters is 0.144 mm? No, because 1 meter is 1000 mm, so 0.000144 meters is 0.144 mm. Wait, no, 0.000144 meters is 0.144 mm because 1 mm is 0.001 meters. So 0.000144 m is 0.144 mm? Wait, no, wait: 1 mm is 0.001 m, so 0.000144 m is 0.144 mm? No, that can't be right because 0.0001 m is 0.1 mm. So 0.000144 m is 0.144 mm. Wait, but that would make the radius 0.144 mm, so the diameter is twice that, which is 0.288 mm, approximately 0.3 mm. Looking at the options, option A is 0.3 mm. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Did I get the units right? Surface tension is in N/m, which is the same as mN/m, right. So 72 mN/m is 0.072 N/m. Yes. ΔP is 1000 Pa. So 2 * 0.072 = 0.144. Divided by 1000 is 0.000144 m, which is 0.144 mm for radius. So diameter is twice that, 0.288 mm, which is approximately 0.3 mm. So option A is 0.3 mm, which seems correct.

Wait a second, I'm a bit confused because sometimes I've seen the formula as ΔP = 4γ / r for a spherical droplet when considering both sides of the surface tension. No, wait, no. For a liquid droplet, the pressure inside is higher, and the formula is ΔP = 2γ / r. Because surface tension acts on the circumference, and the pressure difference comes from that. So I think I applied it correctly.

Alternatively, let me think about units again. 2γ is 2*0.072 N/m = 0.144 N/m. Divide by 1000 Pa (which is N/m²), so (N/m) / (N/m²) = m. So 0.144 /1000 = 0.000144 m, which is 0.144 mm as radius. So diameter is 0.288 mm, which rounds to 0.3 mm. So option A is correct.

To determine the diameter of a water droplet at 20°C where the internal pressure is 1.0 kPa greater than the external pressure, we use the Laplace pressure formula:

\[
\Delta P = \frac{2\gamma}{r}
\]

Where:
- \(\Delta P = 1000 \, \text{Pa}\) (1.0 kPa),
- \(\gamma = 0.072 \, \text{N/m}\) (surface tension of water at 20°C),
- \(r\) is the radius of the droplet.

Rearranging the formula to solve for \(r\):

\[
r = \frac{2\gamma}{\Delta P}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
r = \frac{2 \times 0.072}{1000} = \frac{0.144}{1000} = 0.000144 \, \text{m} = 0.144 \, \text{mm}
\]

The diameter \(d\) is twice the radius:

\[
d = 2r = 2 \times 0.144 \, \text{mm} = 0.288 \, \text{mm} \approx 0.3 \, \text{mm}
\]

Thus, the diameter of the droplet is approximately **0.3 mm**, corresponding to option A.
