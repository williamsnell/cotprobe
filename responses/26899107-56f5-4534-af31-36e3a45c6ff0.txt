The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A 22-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a 5-day history of sore throat and fever. During the past 3 days, she also has noticed a change in her voice and has had increased pain with swallowing. She has been taking acetaminophen since her symptoms began. Medical history is unremarkable and she takes no routine medications. Vital signs are temperature 40.0°C (104.0°F), pulse 130/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 102/66 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 97%. Examination of the oropharynx shows erythema, edema, and anterior displacement of the right side of the soft palate. The uvula is deviated to the left. There is a white exudate on the right tonsil. Trismus is noted. Palpation of the neck discloses enlarged, tender, mobile anterior cervical lymph nodes. In addition to antibiotic therapy, which of the following is the most appropriate management?

Options:

A: Oral nystatin therapy
B: Tranquilizer therapy
C: Intravenous methylprednisolone therapy
D: Oral pain reliever therapy
E: Intravenous antiviral therapy
F: Incision and drainage
G: Salt water gargle
H: Antacid therapy
I: Oral antifungal therapy
J: Inhaled corticosteroid therapy

Okay, so I've got this medical question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read through it carefully.

A 22-year-old woman comes to the emergency department with a 5-day history of a sore throat and fever. In the past 3 days, she noticed a change in her voice and increased pain when swallowing. She's been taking acetaminophen since her symptoms started. Her medical history is unremarkable, and she doesn't take any routine medications. 

Vital signs: Temp is 40°C (104°F), which is pretty high. Pulse is 130/min, that's tachycardia. Respirations are 18/min, normal. Blood pressure is 102/66, which is a bit low, maybe hypotensive? Oxygen saturation is 97% on room air, so that's okay.

On examination, her oropharynx shows erythema, edema, and the right side of the soft palate is displaced anteriorly. The uvula is deviated to the left. There's a white exudate on the right tonsil. She has trismus, which is difficulty opening the mouth, and palpation of the neck reveals enlarged, tender, mobile anterior cervical lymph nodes.

The question is, besides antibiotics, what's the most appropriate management?

Options are A to J.

First, I need to think about what's going on here. The patient has a sore throat, fever, voice change, and dysphagia. The physical exam shows signs of a throat infection. The exudate on the tonsil and the displacement of the uvula and soft palate make me think of a peritonsillar abscess. Because when the uvula deviates, it's often due to a collection of fluid or pus on one side—like in an abscess. Also, trismus is a classic sign of a peritonsillar abscess because the pressure from the abscess can make it hard to open the mouth.

Peritonsillar abscesses are typically caused by bacteria, often Streptococcus or Staphylococcus. They can develop from untreated tonsillitis. Treatment usually involves antibiotics and sometimes drainage of the abscess, especially if it's large or causing significant symptoms.

Looking at the options:

A: Oral nystatin – that's an antifungal, usually for yeast infections. Doesn't seem right here.

B: Tranquilizer – maybe for anxiety, but not relevant to the infection.

C: IV methylprednisolone – steroids can help reduce inflammation, but I'm not sure if that's the first-line here. Maybe for severe cases.

D: Oral pain reliever – she's already taking acetaminophen, which is a pain reliever. But maybe stronger? Not sure if that's the main issue.

E: IV antiviral – if it's viral, but the symptoms suggest bacterial.

F: Incision and drainage – if there's an abscess, this is standard treatment to drain it.

G: Salt water gargle – might help symptomatically, but not a treatment.

H: Antacid – not related.

I: Oral antifungal – same as A, probably not.

J: Inhaled corticosteroid – for asthma or allergies, not this case.

So, the main issue is a peritonsillar abscess. The standard treatment is to drain it. So option F: Incision and drainage.

Wait, but the question says "in addition to antibiotic therapy." So antibiotics are given, but if there's an abscess, you also need to drain it. So the answer would be F.

Another point: the presence of trismus, deviated uvula, and exudate all point to a peritonsillar abscess. So the management would include both antibiotics and drainage.

The patient presents with symptoms and signs indicative of a peritonsillar abscess, including fever, sore throat, voice change, dysphagia, trismus, and physical findings such as uvula deviation and tonsillar exudate. The most appropriate management, in addition to antibiotics, is incision and drainage of the abscess to relieve pressure and prevent complications. 

Answer: F
