Okay, so I've got this problem here about George betting on basketball. Let me try to break it down. George is putting a $100,000 bet on the Bulls winning the NBA Finals. It's an even-money bet, which I think means that if they win, he gets his $100k back plus another $100k profit, making it $200k total. If they lose, he just loses the $100k.

He has a logarithmic utility-of-wealth function. Hmm, I remember that logarithmic utility means that the utility (or satisfaction) he gets from wealth increases logarithmically, which implies diminishing marginal utility. So, small changes in wealth matter more to him when he's poor, but less when he's rich.

His current wealth is $1,000,000. He wants to know the minimum probability he must assign to the Bulls winning for him to make this bet. So, he's risk-averse because of the logarithmic utility, and we need to find the probability p where the expected utility of taking the bet equals his current utility without the bet.

Let me jot down the formula. The expected utility when he takes the bet should be equal to the utility of his current wealth. Because if the expected utility is higher, he would take the bet, but since he's considering the minimum probability, it's the point where he's indifferent.

So, the utility function is U(w) = ln(w), where w is his wealth.

His current wealth is $1,000,000, so U_current = ln(1,000,000).

If he wins the bet, his wealth becomes 1,000,000 + 100,000 = 1,100,000. If he loses, it's 1,000,000 - 100,000 = 900,000.

The expected utility of the bet is p * ln(1,100,000) + (1-p) * ln(900,000).

Set this equal to his current utility:

p * ln(1,100,000) + (1-p) * ln(900,000) = ln(1,000,000)

I can solve this equation for p.

Let me compute the logs. I know that ln(1,000,000) is ln(1e6) = 13.8155 (since ln(e^13.8155) ≈ 1e6, because e^10 is about 22026, e^13 is ~442413, e^14 is ~1202604, so 1e6 is between 13 and 14, closer to 13.8).

Similarly, ln(1,100,000) is ln(1.1 * 1e6) = ln(1.1) + ln(1e6) ≈ 0.09531 + 13.8155 ≈ 13.9108.

And ln(900,000) is ln(0.9 * 1e6) = ln(0.9) + ln(1e6) ≈ -0.10536 + 13.8155 ≈ 13.7101.

So plugging into the equation:

p * 13.9108 + (1-p) * 13.7101 = 13.8155

Expanding:

13.9108 p + 13.7101 -13.7101 p = 13.8155

Combine like terms:

(13.9108 - 13.7101) p + 13.7101 = 13.8155

That's 0.2007 p + 13.7101 = 13.8155

Subtract 13.7101 from both sides:

0.2007 p = 13.8155 - 13.7101 ≈ 0.1054

So p ≈ 0.1054 / 0.2007 ≈ 0.525.

Wait, that gives p ≈ 0.525, which is option A. But wait, wait, I think I might have messed up the equation. Let me double-check.

Wait, the expected utility is p * ln(1,100,000) + (1-p) * ln(900,000) = ln(1,000,000)

So, 13.9108 p + 13.7101 (1-p) = 13.8155.

Wait, that's correct. Because when you expand, it's 13.9108 p + 13.7101 -13.7101 p = 13.8155.

So that's 0.2007 p +13.7101 = 13.8155.

Then, 0.2007 p = 0.1054 → p≈0.525.

So the minimum probability he needs to believe the Bulls will win is 52.5%, which is option A.

The problem involves George, who has a logarithmic utility function, deciding whether to place a $100,000 even-money bet on the Bulls winning the NBA Finals. His current wealth is $1,000,000, and we need to determine the minimum probability he must assign to the Bulls winning for the bet to be indifferent in terms of expected utility.

Using the logarithmic utility function \( U(w) = \ln(w) \), where \( w \) is wealth, we calculate the expected utility of taking the bet and set it equal to the utility of his current wealth. If the Bulls win, George's wealth becomes $1,100,000, and if they lose, it becomes $900,000. The equation is:

\[
p \cdot \ln(1,100,000) + (1-p) \cdot \ln(900,000) = \ln(1,000,000)
\]

Calculating the natural logarithms:
- \( \ln(1,000,000) \approx 13.8155 \)
- \( \ln(1,100,000) \approx 13.9108 \)
- \( \ln(900,000) \approx 13.7101 \)

Substituting these values into the equation:

\[
13.9108 \cdot p + 13.7101 \cdot (1-p) = 13.8155
\]

Simplifying:

\[
13.9108p + 13.7101 - 13.7101p = 13.8155
\]

\[
0.2007p + 13.7101 = 13.8155
\]

Solving for \( p \):

\[
0.2007p = 0.1054
\]

\[
p \approx 0.525
\]

Thus, George must believe there is at least a 52.5% chance the Bulls will win for the bet to be indifferent. The correct answer is:

A
