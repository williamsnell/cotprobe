Okay, so I need to figure out the difference between monopoly and monopsony. I remember from my economics class that these terms are related to market structures, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact definitions. Let me try to break it down.

Monopoly, as I recall, has something to do with a single seller. I think it's when there's only one company providing a particular product or service. That makes sense because if there's only one seller, they can set the prices since there's no competition. So the key point here is that the seller has a lot of market power, leading to higher prices and possibly lower quality because there's no competition driving them to improve.

Now, monopsony. I'm less sure about this one. I think it's the opposite of monopoly but in terms of buyers. So if monopoly is one seller, monopsony must be one buyer. That single buyer would have control over the purchasing side of the market. In that case, the buyer could dictate prices down because they're the only one buying, so sellers have to lower their prices to sell to them. This affects the market dynamics because the buyer's power can influence the supply and pricing.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one correctly states that monopoly is a single seller and monopsony is a single buyer. Let's go through each option.

Option A says they're the same. That can't be right because they're opposites in terms of sellers and buyers.

Option B mentions unrestricted competition in monopoly, which contradicts what I know. Monopoly is about no competition, so B is wrong.

Option C says monopoly is a single buyer and monopsony a single seller. That's the reverse of what I think, so C is incorrect.

Option D talks about buyers setting prices in monopoly and sellers in monopsony. Wait, no, I think monopoly is about the seller setting prices, so D might be mixed up.

Option E states that monopoly has one seller and many buyers, monopsony has many sellers and one buyer. That aligns with what I was thinking. Monopoly is one seller, many buyers; monopsony is one buyer, many sellers.

Option F refers to multiple sellers and buyers, which doesn't fit either term.

Option G says monopoly is one buyer, monopsony one seller. Again, that's the opposite of what I think, so G is wrong.

Option H says monopoly has many competitors, which is incorrect because monopoly has none. H is out.

Option I mentions single supplier and distributor, which sounds a bit off. I'm not sure, but I think E is a better fit.

Option J states that monopoly is one seller and monopsony one buyer, which matches what I believe. Wait, so E and J both seem relevant. Let me check.

E says: Monopoly is a market with one seller and many buyers, monopsony is a market with many sellers and one buyer. That seems correct.

J says: Monopoly is one seller, monopsony one buyer. It's a bit more concise but also correct. Hmm, both E and J seem to be correct, but the way they're phrased might differ.

Wait, the question is about the difference. So E explains both sides, while J is a direct statement. Let me think: the question asks for the difference, so E might be the better option because it contrasts the two structures more clearly.

Wait no, looking again, J is a direct and accurate statement. Monopoly is one seller, monopsony one buyer. So E also is correct but perhaps more detailed. But the options are structured as the difference, so E explains the structure in terms of sellers and buyers.

Wait, the question is about what is the difference, so E is correct because it explains that in monopoly, it's one seller and many buyers, and in monopsony, it's many sellers and one buyer. That's the key difference. So E is the correct answer.

The correct distinction is that a monopoly involves a single seller and many buyers, while a monopsony involves many sellers and a single buyer.

Answer: E
