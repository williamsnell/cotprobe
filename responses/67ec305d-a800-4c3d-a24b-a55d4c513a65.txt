Okay, so I have this question about Protocol 14 and the European Court of Human Rights. I need to figure out which statement is false. Let's go through each option one by one.

First, I remember that Protocol 14 is an amendment to the European Convention on Human Rights. It was designed to make the court more efficient. Let me try to recall what changes it introduced.

Option A: Protocol 14 established the Human Rights Council. Wait, the Human Rights Council isn't part of the ECHR structure. The court has judges, a Grand Chamber, and there's the Committee of Ministers. Oh wait, the Human Rights Council is a different body, maybe part of the UN? So maybe this is false. But I'm not sure, so I'll keep it in mind.

Option B: Protocol 14 mandated a two-judge formation for admissibility cases. I think before Protocol 14, admissibility cases were heard by three judges. Protocol 14 changed that to a single judge for admissibility. So if B says two judges, that's incorrect. Hmm, so B might be false. But wait, maybe it's one judge, so B is wrong.

Option C: Protocol 14 reduced the jurisdiction of the court. I don't think so. Protocol 14 was more about procedure and efficiency, not reducing jurisdiction. So C is probably false, but I'm not certain.

Option D: Protocol 14 shortened the judicial term. I remember that Protocol 14 did change the term from 9 years to 6 years, so D is true. So D is not the false statement.

Option E: Protocol 14 introduced a requirement for unanimous decision-making in admissibility. I think admissibility decisions now require a majority, not unanimous. So E is false because it claims a requirement for unanimity, which didn't happen.

Option F: Protocol 14 added a new criterion for admissibility. Yes, I think it introduced the ' subsidiarity ' principle, so F is true.

Option G: Protocol 14 eliminated the right to individual petition. No, individuals can still petition, but the procedure changed. So G is false.

Option H: Protocol 14 changed the committee from three to one judge. Yes, admissibility cases now go to a single judge, so H is true.

Option I: Protocol 14 extended the judicial term. No, it reduced it from 9 to 6 years, so I is false.

Option J: Protocol 14 abolished the Commission of Human Rights. I think the Commission was replaced by the Court, but I'm not sure if Protocol 14 did that. Wait, the original Convention had the European Commission of Human Rights, which was replaced by the Court. But when did that happen? I think the Court was established in 1959, and the Commission was abolished in 1998, but Protocol 14 was in 2004. So J might be true because the Commission was already abolished before Protocol 14. So J's statement would be false if the Protocol didn't abolish it, but if the Commission was already gone, then J's statement is false because Protocol 14 didn't abolish it; it was already done.

Wait, but the question is about what Protocol 14 did. So if the Commission was abolished before Protocol 14, then J is stating that Protocol 14 abolished it, which would be false. So J is false.

Now, going back to the options, I need to find which statement is false.

From what I remember:

- Protocol 14 changed admissibility cases from three judges to one (so H is true, B is false as it says two judges).
- The term was reduced (D is true, I is false).
- Unanimous decisions were not required for admissibility (E is false).
- The Commission was abolished before Protocol 14 (J is false).
- G says it eliminated individual petitions, which isn't true; they can still petition, but the process changed.

So which is the false statement? The question is asking for the one false statement.

Looking at the options:

A: Protocol 14 established the Human Rights Council. I think the Human Rights Council is a different body, perhaps part of the UN, so this is false.

But wait, the European Court is part of the Council of Europe, not the UN. So the Human Rights Council might be a different thing. So A is false because Protocol 14 didn't establish that; it's part of the UN system perhaps.

Alternatively, maybe the Human Rights Council is a committee within the Council of Europe, but I'm not certain. If A is false, then that's a possible answer.

But let's focus on the statements. The correct answer is one of these.

From my earlier analysis, the false statements are A, B, C, E, G, I, J.

Wait, but only one is the answer.

Wait, the question is which statement is false.

Looking back:

Option B says two-judge formation. I thought it went from three to one, so B is false.

Option E says unanimous decision-making. I think it's majority, so E is false.

Option G says eliminated individual petition. No, so G is false.

Option I says extended term, which is false because it was reduced.

Option J says abolished the Commission, which is true because the Commission was already gone before Protocol 14. So J is false because Protocol 14 didn't abolish it.

Wait, but the question is which statement is false. So multiple options are false, but I need to choose the correct one.

But the question is a multiple-choice with one correct answer.

Let me think again. The options are:

A: Protocol 14 established the Human Rights Council. I think this is false because the Human Rights Council is a different body, perhaps the UN Human Rights Council, which Protocol 14 didn't establish. The European Court is part of the Council of Europe, not the UN.

B: Protocol 14 mandated a two-judge formation. No, it went to one judge, so B is false.

C: Reduced jurisdiction. I don't think so; it's about procedure, so C is false.

D: Shortened term. True.

E: Unanimous decisions. False.

F: New admissibility criterion. True.

G: Eliminated individual petition. False.

H: Changed to one judge. True.

I: Extended term. False.

J: Abolished Commission. False.

But the question is which one is false. The options are A to J, and the correct answer is one of them.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check:

- Protocol 14 did change the admissibility procedure to a single judge, so H is correct (changed to one judge), and B is incorrect as it says two judges.

- The term was reduced, so I is false.

- The Commission was abolished in 1998, so J is false because Protocol 14 didn't abolish it.

So among the options, the false statements are A, B, C, E, G, I, J.

But the question is which one is false. Wait, the options are given, and only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the answer is A because the Human Rights Council was established by another protocol or not by 14.

Wait, no, the European Court of Human Rights is part of the Council of Europe, and Protocol 14 is about the court's procedures, not establishing a Human Rights Council. The Human Rights Council might refer to the UN's body, which is separate. So A is false because Protocol 14 didn't establish that.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E because admissibility cases don't require unanimity.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Let me think again.

The main points from Protocol 14:

- Changed admissibility from three judges to one (so H is correct, B is wrong).

- Shortened judicial term (D correct, I wrong).

- No longer requires individual petition to be subsidiarity-friendly, but didn't eliminate the right (so G is wrong).

- Added subsidiarity as a criterion (F correct).

- Unanimous decisions not required (E wrong).

So the false statements are B, C, E, G, I, J, and A.

But the question is which one is false. The options are A to J.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E because Protocol 14 didn't require unanimity.

But the question is about which statement is false. So among the options, the correct false statement is E.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me try to recall: in Protocol 14, admissibility cases are decided by a single judge, and decisions don't require unanimity. So E is false because it says introduced a requirement for unanimous decision-making.

So E is the false statement.

Wait, but the user's answer was H. Hmm.

Wait, no, the user's answer was H, but in my analysis, H is correct because Protocol 14 changed from three to one judge for admissibility.

So perhaps the false statement is H? Wait, no, H says that Protocol 14 changed the committee from three to one judge, which is correct. So H is true.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me check again.

The original procedure had admissibility cases heard by a committee of three judges. Protocol 14 changed that to a single judge. So H is correct (changed from three to one), so H is true.

So the false statement is B, which says two judges, which is incorrect.

Wait, but the options are A to J, and the correct answer is one of them.

So the false statements are:

A: False (established Human Rights Council, which it didn't).

B: False (two judges, should be one).

C: False (reduced jurisdiction, which it didn't).

E: False (unanimous decisions, which it didn't require).

G: False (eliminated individual petition, which it didn't).

I: False (extended term, which it didn't; it reduced).

J: False (abolished Commission, which was done before).

So the options that are false are A, B, C, E, G, I, J.

But the question is which one is the false statement, so only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the answer is A because the Human Rights Council was established by another protocol or not by 14.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E because it's about unanimous decisions.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the correct answer is E.

Wait, but I think the correct answer is E: Protocol 14 introduced a requirement for unanimous decision-making in admissibility cases. That's false because decisions are by majority, not unanimity.

So the answer is E.
</think>

The question asks which statement about Protocol 14 is false. Protocol 14 focused on procedural changes to the European Court of Human Rights, such as reducing the number of judges hearing admissibility cases from three to one and shortening the judicial term. It did not establish the Human Rights Council, which is a separate entity. Statements B, E, G, I, and J are also false based on the analysis, but the most directly false statement is E, as Protocol 14 did not require unanimity in admissibility decisions.

Answer: E
