Question:

To improve the quality of rental housing within its boundaries, a city proposed an ordinance requiring all new and existing rental housing units to provide at least one full bathroom for each bedroom, plumbing and electrical hookups for a washer and dryer, and a covered parking space. A majority of the owners of existing rental housing in the city opposed the ordinance. They argued that it would dramatically decrease the number of lowincome rental housing units because owners would be unable to raise rents enough to recoup the investment required to comply. Without denying these contentions, the city enacted the ordinance. A plaintiff who owns low-income rental housing has sued the city, claiming only that the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face. Which of the following best states the burden of persuasion in this action?

Options:

A: The plaintiff must demonstrate that there is no rational relationship between the ordinance and any legitimate state interest, because the ordinance regulates economic activity of a type normally presumed to be within state regulatory authority.
B: The plaintiff must demonstrate that the ordinance does not serve a significant public interest, because it adversely affects low-income individuals.
C: The plaintiff must demonstrate that the ordinance is not proportionate to the intended public benefit, because it imposes a financial burden on property owners.
D: The city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, because it adversely affects the fundamental right of rental housing owners to use their property in the manner they deem most economically efficient.
E: The city must demonstrate that the ordinance does not violate the rights of the property owners, because it regulates the use of their property.
F: The city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to improve the standard of living within its jurisdiction, because it regulates housing conditions.
G: The city must prove that the ordinance has a rational basis, because it impacts economic activity within its jurisdiction.
H: The plaintiff must demonstrate that there is no substantial relationship between the ordinance and the city's goal of improving housing quality, because it may result in fewer low-income housing options.
I: The plaintiff must demonstrate that the ordinance is not substantially related to an important state interest, because it requires some owners of rental housing to invest money that they will not be able to recoup from increased rents.
J: The city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, because it will have a substantial and disproportionate negative impact on low-income persons.

Alright, so I have this question about constitutional law, specifically about an ordinance a city has passed regarding rental housing. The question is about the burden of persuasion in a lawsuit challenging the ordinance. Let me try to break this down.

First, the city passed an ordinance requiring rental housing units to have certain amenities: one full bathroom per bedroom, plumbing and electrical hookups for a washer and dryer, and a covered parking space. Existing owners are opposing it because they say it will reduce low-income housing units since they can't raise rents enough to cover the costs.

The plaintiff is suing, claiming the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face. So, the issue is likely under the Due Process Clause or perhaps the Takings Clause, but more likely, it's a substantive due process issue, maybe something like a regulatory taking or an equal protection issue. 

I remember that when a law is challenged as unconstitutional, the court typically applies some level of scrutiny depending on what right is being affected. If it's a fundamental right, like property use, strict scrutiny applies, but more often, for economic regulations, rational basis review is used.

So, the question is asking about the burden of persuasion here. The options are from A to J, each suggesting a different standard.

Looking at the options:

A says the plaintiff must show no rational relationship because it's economic activity. But wait, rational basis usually applies to economic regulations, and the plaintiff would have to show it's not rationally related to a legitimate interest. But this option says "regulates economic activity normally within state authority," which makes sense because under rational basis, the state's interest is legitimate as long as the law is rationally related.

B says the plaintiff must show the ordinance doesn't serve a significant public interest. That sounds more like strict scrutiny elements, where the government must show a compelling interest and the law is narrowly tailored. But this is about significant public interest, which might be more of a strict scrutiny factor in some contexts, but I'm not sure.

C says the plaintiff must show it's not proportionate. Proportionality is more of a test in some countries or in certain U.S. contexts, like under the Equal Protection Clause for fundamental rights. If the law imposes a burden that isn't proportional to the benefit, that might be an issue, but I'm not sure if that's the standard here.

D says the city must show it's necessary to serve a compelling state interest because it affects a fundamental right. This sounds like strict scrutiny. But whether the right to use property economically is a fundamental right? Maybe not necessarily here. The city's regulation is likely subject to a lower standard.

E says the city must show it doesn't violate property rights. That's vague, and I think it's more about the plaintiff's burden. The city wouldn't have to prove it doesn't violate; the plaintiff is challenging it.

F says the city must prove it's necessary to improve living standards. Again, sounds like a strict scrutiny point, but is housing quality a compelling interest? Maybe, but perhaps a lower standard applies.

G says the city must prove rational basis because it impacts economic activity. Rational basis is the standard for most economic regulations, so the city would have to show the ordinance is rationally related to a legitimate interest.

H suggests the plaintiff must show no substantial relationship. That's a higher burden than rational basis. Substantial relationship would be more like intermediate scrutiny, which applies to certain suspect classifications or fundamental rights.

I says the plaintiff must show it's not substantially related to an important interest. Again, this seems like intermediate scrutiny, but if the issue is about whether the law is related to an important state interest, maybe it's a different approach.

J says the city must show it's necessary for a compelling interest because it impacts low-income people disproportionately. That sounds like strict scrutiny again, possibly under the Equal Protection Clause if there's a suspect class involved, but low-income isn't a suspect class. Alternatively, if it's a fundamental right being affected, strict scrutiny could apply.

Wait, the ordinance is affecting property owners' ability to use their property. Property is a fundamental right under the Due Process Clause, so if the law is a substantial regulation or taking, strict scrutiny might apply. But usually, for economic regulations, rational basis is used unless it's a fundamental right being burdened.

But here, the plaintiff is challenging on its face, so maybe it's a substantive due process issue. The court would apply a certain level of scrutiny. If the ordinance is a reasonable regulation, then rational basis applies. But if it's a significant interference with property rights, strict scrutiny might kick in.

The question is about the burden of persuasion. Under rational basis, the city only needs to show the law is rationally related to a legitimate interest. The plaintiff would have to show it's not. Under strict scrutiny, the city would have to show it's necessary to serve a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored.

So, in this case, because the ordinance is about rental housing, which is an economic activity, I think rational basis applies. Therefore, the plaintiff must show that the ordinance is not rationally related to a legitimate state interest.

Looking back at the options, option A says the plaintiff must demonstrate no rational relationship because it's economic activity. That sounds correct because under rational basis, the city's interest is legitimate, and the law must be rationally related.

Option G is similar but states that the city must prove rational basis. No, because the burden is on the plaintiff to show it's unconstitutional. So, the plaintiff must show the ordinance isn't rationally related.

Wait, no, actually, in a rational basis review, the city must show that the law is rationally related. So the plaintiff must show that it's not. So A is correct because it's about the plaintiff's burden.

Alternatively, option G says the city must prove rational basis because it impacts economic activity. But the standard is that the city has to show a rational basis, so the plaintiff must show it's lacking. So the burden is on the plaintiff to show the law isn't rationally related.

Therefore, the correct answer is A.
</think>

The question revolves around determining the burden of persuasion when a city ordinance is challenged as unconstitutional. The ordinance imposes requirements on rental housing units, and the plaintiff argues it is unconstitutional on its face. The analysis focuses on the appropriate standard of review, likely rational basis, as the ordinance pertains to economic activity and property use, which are typically subject to such scrutiny unless a fundamental right is implicated.

Under rational basis review, the city must show that the ordinance is rationally related to a legitimate state interest. The plaintiff bears the burden of persuasion to demonstrate that the ordinance fails this standard. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: The plaintiff must demonstrate that there is no rational relationship between the ordinance and any legitimate state interest, because the ordinance regulates economic activity of a type normally presumed to be within state regulatory authority.**
