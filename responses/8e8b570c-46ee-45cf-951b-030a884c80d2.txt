Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a convex lens producing an image on a screen. The image is three times as large as the object, and the screen is 14.4 cm away from the lens. I need to find the refracting power of the lens, which is the diopter value. Hmm, I remember that diopters are the reciprocal of the focal length in meters, so Refracting Power P = 1/f, where f is in meters.

Wait, right, the image is on a screen, so this is a real image. And since it's three times the size, that's the magnification. I think the magnification m is equal to the image height over the object height, but when dealing with distances, I think it's related to the image distance and object distance. Oh yeah, for lenses, the magnification m is given by m = h'/h = -v/u, where v is the image distance and u is the object distance. But I'm a bit confused about the signs. Since it's a convex lens and the image is real, both u and v should be positive, right? Because real images form on the opposite side of the lens.

Wait, the problem says the image is three times as large, so m is positive 3? Because if the image is upright, but wait, convex lenses usually produce upright images only when the object is within the focal length, but in that case, the image isn't real. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Wait, for a convex lens, when the object is beyond the focal length, the image is real, inverted, and larger. Oh, wait no, actually, a convex lens produces an upright image only when the object is within the focal length, but that's a virtual image. Wait, but the problem says the image is on a screen, which implies it's real, so the object must be beyond the focal length, and the image would be inverted, so the magnification would be negative. Wait, but the problem says the image is three times as large as the object, so the absolute value is 3, so m = -3 because it's inverted.

Wait, but the problem just states the image is three times as large, so maybe they're considering the magnitude. So maybe I can just take m as 3. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let's proceed.

So, m = -v/u. Since m is -3 (because image is inverted), and v is given as 14.4 cm because that's where the image is formed on the screen. So v = 14.4 cm. So plugging into m = -v/u, we get -3 = -14.4 / u. The negatives would cancel, so 3 = 14.4 / u. So u = 14.4 / 3 = 4.8 cm. Wait, that's the object distance, u = 4.8 cm.

Now, using the lens formula: 1/f = 1/v + 1/u. Wait, or is it 1/f = 1/v + 1/u? No, wait, the lens formula is 1/f = 1/v + 1/u. Wait, no, wait: when dealing with real images, the sign conventions can be a bit tricky. Wait, I think the correct formula is 1/f = 1/v + 1/u, but I might have the signs wrong. Wait, let me think: for a convex lens, the focal length is positive. So, the image distance v and object distance u are positive because they're measured from the lens on the same side as the image and object, respectively, but wait, no, wait: in the standard sign convention, the object distance u is positive when it's on the same side as the incoming light, so for real images, u is positive. Similarly, the image distance v is positive when it's on the opposite side, which it is for real images. So the formula is 1/f = 1/v + 1/u.

So substituting the values: v = 14.4 cm, u = 4.8 cm. So 1/f = (1/14.4) + (1/4.8). Let me compute that.

First, calculate 1/14.4. 14.4 is 144/10, so 1/14.4 is 10/144 ≈ 0.06944. And 1/4.8 is approximately 0.208333. Adding them together: 0.06944 + 0.208333 ≈ 0.277777.

So 1/f ≈ 0.277777 cm^-1. Wait, but that's in cm, and we need diopters, which are in meters. So I need to convert cm to meters. 1 cm is 0.01 meters, so 1/f in meters would be 0.277777 * (1/0.01) )? Wait, no, wait: 1/f in cm^-1 is 0.277777, which is 27.7777 cm^-1. To convert to meters, since 1 m = 100 cm, 1 cm = 0.01 m. So 1/f (in m^-1) is 27.7777 cm^-1 * (1 m/100 cm) )? Wait, no, wait: 1 cm^-1 is 100 m^-1. So 27.7777 cm^-1 = 27.7777 * 100 m^-1 = 2777.77 m^-1. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, that would make f = 1/2777.77 ≈ 0.00036 m, which is 0.36 mm. That seems way too small for a lens that's forming a real image at 14.4 cm.

Wait, I must have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me redo it.

Wait, so 1/f = 1/v + 1/u.

v is 14.4 cm, u is 4.8 cm.

So 1/f = 1/14.4 + 1/4.8.

Let me compute 1/14.4:

14.4 = 144/10, so 1/14.4 = 10/144 = 5/72 ≈ 0.069444.

1/4.8 = 1/(48/10) ) = 10/48 = 5/24 ≈ 0.208333.

Adding them: 0.069444 + 0.208333 ≈ 0.277777 cm^-1.

So 1/f ≈ 0.277777 cm^-1.

Wait, but 0.277777 cm^-1 is the same as 2.77777 × 10^1 cm^-1, which is 27.7777 cm^-1.

Wait, but diopters are per meter, so 1 m = 100 cm. So 27.7777 cm^-1 is equal to 27.7777 × (1 m / 100 cm) )^{-1} ?

Wait, no, wait: 1 cm^-1 is 100 m^-1 because 1 cm = 0.01 m. So, 27.7777 cm^-1 = 27.7777 × 100 m^-1 = 2777.77 m^-1.

So f = 1 / (2777.77 m^-1) ≈ 0.00036 m = 0.36 cm. Hmmm, that seems way too small, but perhaps that's correct.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me double-check the lens formula. The lens formula is 1/f = 1/v + 1/u, where f is in meters, v is in meters, u is in meters. Oh wait, no, wait: when using the lens formula, all distances should be in the same unit, either meters or centimeters. So maybe I should work in centimeters and then convert to meters at the end.

So let's redo the calculation using centimeters for all distances.

1/f = 1/14.4 + 1/4.8.

As before, 1/14.4 ≈ 0.069444, 1/4.8 ≈ 0.208333.

Sum is approximately 0.277777 cm^-1.

So f = 1 / 0.277777 ≈ 3.6 cm.

Wait, 3.6 cm is 0.036 meters. So the focal length f is 0.036 m.

Refracting power P is 1/f in meters, so P = 1 / 0.036 ≈ 27.78 diopters.

Wait, that makes sense. So looking at the options, option I is 27.78 diopters.

The problem involves a convex lens producing a real, inverted image three times the size of the object, with the screen (image) 14.4 cm from the lens. To find the refracting power of the lens, we use the magnification formula and the lens equation.

1. **Magnification Relation**:  
   The magnification \( m = \frac{h'}{h} = -\frac{v}{u} \). Given \( m = -3 \) (since the image is inverted and real), and \( v = 14.4 \, \text{cm} \), we solve for \( u \):  
   \[
   -3 = -\frac{14.4}{u} \implies u = \frac{14.4}{3} = 4.8 \, \text{cm}.
   \]

2. **Lens Formula**:  
   Using the lens equation \( \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{v} + \frac{1}{u} \), substitute \( v = 14.4 \, \text{cm} \) and \( u = 4.8 \, \text{cm} \):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{14.4} + \frac{1}{4.8} = 0.06944 + 0.20833 \approx 0.27777 \, \text{cm}^{-1}.
   \]

3. **Convert to Diopters**:  
   The refracting power \( P \) in diopters is \( P = \frac{1}{f} \) where \( f \) is in meters. Converting \( f \) from centimeters:  
   \[
   f = \frac{1}{0.27777} \approx 3.6 \, \text{cm} = 0.036 \, \text{m}.
   \]  
   Thus,  
   \[
   P = \frac{1}{0.036} \approx 27.78 \, \text{diopters}.
   \]

The refracting power of the lens is **27.78 diopters**, corresponding to option I.
