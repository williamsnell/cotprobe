Okay, so I've got this problem where Sapphire has 179 balloons and she needs to put 7 balloons in each bouquet. The question is asking how many bouquets she can make. The options are from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I think I should figure out how many times 7 can go into 179. That makes sense because each bouquet uses 7 balloons, so the total number of bouquets would be the number of times 7 fits into 179 without exceeding it. So, I guess I need to divide 179 by 7.

Let me do the division step by step. 7 times what gives me a number just below or equal to 179. Let me start by seeing how many times 7 goes into 179.

I know that 7 times 20 is 140. So, subtracting 140 from 179 leaves me with 39. Then, how many times does 7 go into 39? Well, 7 times 5 is 35, so that would be 5 times. Adding that to the 20 I had before gives me 25. But wait, 7 times 25 is 175. So, subtracting 175 from 179 leaves me with 4 balloons. Since she can't make a partial bouquet, those 4 balloons don't count towards another full bouquet. So, that would mean she can make 25 bouquets with 4 balloons left over.

Looking at the options, H is 25 bouquets. So, I'm thinking that's the answer. But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should do the division more accurately. 179 divided by 7. Let me write it out:

7 into 17 is 2, because 7*2=14. Subtract 14 from 17 and I get 3. Bring down the 9 to make 39. 7 into 39 is 5, because 7*5=35. Subtract 35 from 39, which leaves 4. So, the division gives me 25 with a remainder of 4. So yes, 25 bouquets, which is option H.

I think that's correct. So the answer should be H.

The correct answer is H: 25 bouquets.
