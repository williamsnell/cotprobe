Okay, so I have this problem about finding the displacements of certain array elements relative to A(1,1,1) in a 3D array. The array is defined as DIMENSION A(10,10,10), and the elements are stored in lexicographic order of their indices. Hmm, I think lexicographic order means that the indices are ordered like dictionary words, so the order would be i, j, k, with i being the first index, j the second, and k the third. So, the storage order would be such that the first dimension changes the slowest, then the second, then the third. Wait, no, in lex order, the order is like i varies the slowest, so for A(i,j,k), the order would be like A(1,1,1), A(1,1,2), ..., A(1,1,10), then A(1,2,1), and so on. So the displacement for a given element depends on how many elements come before it in this order.

The question asks for the displacements of three elements: (a) A(5,6,7), (b) A(10,9,8), and (c) A(1,5,9), relative to A(1,1,1). So, displacement here I think refers to how many positions away each of these elements is from A(1,1,1) in the stored order. Since A(1,1,1) is the first element, its displacement is 0. For the others, we need to calculate how many elements come before them in the lex order, which gives their displacement from A(1,1,1).

Let me think about how to calculate this. For a 3D array, the displacement (number of elements before it) can be calculated by considering each index. The formula should be something like displacement = (i-1)*M*N + (j-1)*N + (k-1), where M is the size of the second dimension and N the third. Wait, but let me think again because the dimensions are 10x10x10, so each dimension has 10 elements.

Wait, no, the formula for the displacement of A(i,j,k) would be (i-1)* (size_j * size_k) + (j-1)*size_k + (k-1). Since all sizes are 10, that's (i-1)*100 + (j-1)*10 + (k-1). Because size_j is 10 and size_k is 10, so 10*10=100. So for any index i, the displacement contributed by i is (i-1)*100, then j contributes (j-1)*10, and k contributes (k-1).

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me take an example. For A(1,1,1), displacement is 0, which matches. For A(1,1,2), displacement is 1. For A(1,1,10), displacement is 9. Then A(1,2,1) would be 10, and so on.

So for each element, the displacement is (i-1)*10*10 + (j-1)*10 + (k-1). So that's (i-1)*100 + (j-1)*10 + (k-1).

Let's calculate each part.

Starting with part (a): A(5,6,7).

So i=5, j=6, k=7.

Displacement = (5-1)*100 + (6-1)*10 + (7-1) = 4*100 + 5*10 +6 = 400 +50 +6=456.

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, no, the formula is correct? Because for each i, the number of elements before it is (i-1)* (number of elements in j and k). Since j and k each have 10, that's 10*10=100. So for each i, i=1 gives 0, i=2 gives 100, etc. So yes, (i-1)*100 is correct.

Then for j, each j adds 10 elements per i. So (j-1)*10. Similarly, k adds 1 per j.

So for A(5,6,7):

i-1=4 → 4*100=400

j-1=5 →5*10=50

k-1=6 →6.

Adding them together: 400+50=450 +6=456. So displacement is 456.

Wait, but the question says "relative to the location of A(1,1,1)", which is displacement 0. So the displacement for A(5,6,7) is 456. So part (a)'s displacement is 456.

Now part (b): A(10,9,8).

i=10, j=9, k=8.

So (10-1)*100 =9*100=900

(j-1)=8 →8*10=80

(k-1)=7 →7.

Total displacement: 900+80=980 +7=987.

So part (b) is 987.

Now part (c): A(1,5,9).

i=1 → (1-1)*100=0

j=5 → (5-1)*10=4*10=40

k=9 → (9-1)=8.

So adding 0 +40 +8=48.

So the displacements are:

(a) 456

(b) 987

(c) 48

Now, looking at the options, which one matches these numbers.

Option C: 456, 987, 48 → yes, that's our values.

Other options:

A: 354,987,48 → part (a) wrong.

B:456,987,84 → part (c) wrong.

C:456,987,48 → correct.

D:456,879,48 → part (b) wrong.

E:456,798,84 → part (b) and (c) wrong.

F:345,789,84 → all wrong.

G:546,987,48 → part (a) wrong.

H:345,987,48 → part (a) wrong.

I:354,798,84 → all wrong.

J:546,879,84 → all wrong.

So the correct option is C: 456, 987, 48.

The displacements are calculated using the formula: displacement = (i-1)*100 + (j-1)*10 + (k-1). For (a) A(5,6,7), displacement is 456. For (b) A(10,9,8), displacement is 987. For (c) A(1,5,9), displacement is 48. The correct option is **C**: 456, 987, 48.
