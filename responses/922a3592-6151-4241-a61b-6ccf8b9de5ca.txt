Okay, I need to figure out the answer to this question. The question is about data arriving at the receiver exactly as sent. Let me think about what each term means.

The question is asking about a concept where the data must be received exactly as it was sent. So, I'm trying to remember the terms related to data transmission and security.

Looking at the options:

A: Message Security - This usually refers to protecting the message from unauthorized access, like encryption. Not sure if it's about exact arrival.

B: Message Clarity - This sounds like the message is clear and understandable, but not necessarily about the data being unchanged.

C: Message Integrity - This term is familiar. I think it refers to ensuring that the data hasn't been altered during transmission. That means the receiver gets it exactly as sent.

D: Message Authenticity - This is about verifying the sender's identity, making sure the message is from who it claims to be. Not directly about the data being unchanged.

E: Message Splashing - I'm not familiar with this term. Maybe a typo? Could it be "Message Splaying" or something else? Not sure, but it's probably not relevant here.

F: Message Reliability - This refers to the data arriving successfully, but I think it's more about whether the data arrives at all, not necessarily exactly as sent. Like, reliable delivery but not about integrity.

G: Message Sending - That's just the act of sending, not a characteristic of the data's state upon arrival.

H: Message Stability - I'm not certain, but this might relate to consistency over time, not the exactness of the data during transmission.

I: Message Confidentiality - This is about keeping the message secret, not about its integrity.

J: Message Completion - This might mean the message was fully received, but again, not necessarily about the data being unchanged.

So, putting it together, the key here is that the data must arrive exactly as sent, which points to Message Integrity. Integrity ensures that the data hasn't been tampered with or altered during transmission.

The correct answer is C: Message Integrity. This term refers to ensuring the data arrives unchanged, exactly as sent.
