Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"At least one of the [world's] societies would have to somehow enormously increase its productivity [in order to achieve global hegemony]. That quantum jump would have to be made before the various scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions on which our post-quantum-leap world rests. It could only be accomplished by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump. Western Europe did just that by means of its brutality and guns and, more important, by geographical and ecological luck."

Okay, so I've got this question about Alfred Crosby's assertion regarding a "quantum jump" that helped Western Europe achieve global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E. The question is asking which option best supports the author's point.

First, I need to understand what the author is saying. The passage mentions that a society needs to make a huge leap in productivity to achieve global dominance. This jump happened before the various revolutions (scientific, technological, etc.) that our current world is built on. The author explains that this was done by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of other continents, particularly through brutal means and geographical luck.

So, the key here is that Europe's quantum jump involved exploiting other regions outside Europe. The author gives examples like using their brutality, guns, and geographical luck. So, the correct answer should be an option that shows Europe exploiting other areas for resources, labor, or land to boost their productivity.

Looking at the options:

A: Discovery and colonization of Australia. Australia was colonized by the British, which was part of the broader colonial period. However, Australia wasn't as resource-rich as other regions like the Americas, and the colonization happened a bit later, in the 18th and 19th centuries. The period in question is up to 1750, so maybe it's a bit on the edge, but I'm not sure if this is the best example.

B: Cultural exchange with Native American tribes. While there was cultural exchange, the author is talking about exploitation for resources and assets, not just cultural interactions. So this might not directly support the quantum jump through exploitation.

C: Development of centralized government in Europe. A centralized government could help in organizing resources and military efforts, but the author specifically mentions exploiting other continents, so this might not be the best fit.

D: Reformation of Catholic Christianity. The Reformation was a significant event, but I don't see how it directly relates to the exploitation of other regions for resources. It's more about religious changes.

E: Conquest of the Aztec Empire. This fits because the Aztec Empire was in the Americas, and the Spanish conquest (part of Europe's expansion) brought in vast resources like silver, which boosted Europe's economy. This seems to align with the author's point about exploiting other continents for their resources.

F: Industrial revolution in Britain. The industrial revolution happened later, around the late 18th century, and it was a result of the earlier accumulation of wealth and resources from colonies. So while it's a big jump, the author is talking about the quantum jump that happened before these revolutions, so this might not be the cause but the effect.

G: Isolationism of Tokugawa Japan. Japan's isolationism would have limited their interactions, but it doesn't directly relate to Europe's exploitation of other regions. It's more about Japan's internal policies.

H: Colonization of the interior of Africa. While Africa was colonized later, the interior wasn't fully colonized until the 19th century with the Scramble for Africa. So maybe this happened after the period in question (up to 1750), making it less relevant.

I: Construction of the Great Wall of China. This was built much earlier, around the 14th century, and it's more about China's defense and borders, not about Europe exploiting China.

J: Establishment of trade routes with China. The trade with China (like the Silk Road and later the maritime routes) did bring in goods like silk and porcelain, but it's not the same as the exploitation of ecosystems and human assets. Also, trade routes existed before the period in question and were part of existing relations, not the exploitation that led to hegemony.

So, looking at these, option E, the conquest of the Aztec Empire, seems to fit best because it's an example of Europe (Spain) exploiting another society for resources, which would support the author's assertion about the quantum jump through exploitation. The Aztec conquest provided wealth and resources that contributed to Europe's rise.

Wait, but the period is up to 1750. The Aztec Empire fell in the early 16th century, so it's within the timeframe. Also, the author mentions using the resources of whole continents, and the Americas provided a lot of resources, including silver which was crucial for Europe's economy.

Another point: The author says that the jump was made by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents. The Conquest of the Aztec Empire (and other parts of the Americas) fits this perfectly because it involved taking over land, exploiting resources, and using human labor, which boosted Europe's productivity and economy, enabling their hegemony.

So, I think E is the best choice. The conquest of the Aztec Empire is a clear example of exploiting another society's resources, which would support the author's point about the quantum jump.

The author argues that Western Europe achieved global hegemony by exploiting the resources, ecosystems, and human assets of other continents. Among the options, the conquest of the Aztec Empire (E) best supports this assertion. This event exemplifies Europe's exploitation of another society for resources, which contributed to Europe's productivity and economic growth, aligning with the author's argument about the quantum jump needed for hegemony.

Answer: E
