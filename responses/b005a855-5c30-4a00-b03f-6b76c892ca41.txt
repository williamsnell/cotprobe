Question:

Explain the mechanism of the genetic determination of sex in humans.

Options:

A: The presence of two X chromosomes in the absence of a Y chromosome has no impact on the sex of an individual.
B: The number of autosomes determines the sex of an individual.
C: The sex of an individual is determined by the number of X chromosomes, irrespective of the Y chromosome.
D: The combination of two Y chromosomes determines that an individual will be female.
E: The presence of an X chromosome and an additional chromosome other than Y determines that an individual will be male.
F: Environmental factors determine the genetic sex of an individual.
G: The presence of the X chromosome determines that an individual will be male.
H: The presence of the Y chromosome determines that an individual will be male.
I: The process of meiosis determines the sex of an individual.
J: The total number of chromosomes in an individual dictates their sex.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the mechanism of how sex is determined genetically in humans. I remember that it's related to the sex chromosomes, X and Y. Let me think through this step by step.

First, humans have 46 chromosomes in total, with 44 being autosomes and two being sex chromosomes. Females typically have two X chromosomes (XX), and males have one X and one Y (XY). So the presence of a Y chromosome usually determines maleness, while two Xs make a female.

Looking at the options:

Option A says that two Xs without a Y have no impact on sex. That's not right because two Xs make a female.

Option B suggests that the number of autosomes determines sex. No, because autosomes are the same for males and females; it's the sex chromosomes that matter.

Option C claims that the number of X chromosomes determines sex, regardless of Y. That's partially true because two Xs make a female, but the presence of a Y is what makes a male. So it's not just the number of Xs.

Option D says two Ys make a female. I don't think that's correct. Two Ys would be a very rare condition, not typical female determination.

Option E states that having an X and another chromosome besides Y determines male. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Males have XY, so an X and a Y. So if the additional chromosome is not Y, like an X and another X, that's female. So E might be trying to say that if you have an X and something else (not Y), it's male. But that doesn't fit because XX is female. So E might be incorrect.

Option F says environmental factors determine genetic sex. No, because genetic sex is determined by the chromosomes, not environment.

Option G suggests that the presence of an X makes you male. No, because females have two Xs.

Option H says the presence of Y determines male. That sounds correct because males have the Y chromosome.

Option I claims meiosis determines sex. No, meiosis is about gamete formation, not directly determining sex.

Option J says total chromosomes dictate sex. No, because both males and females have 46 chromosomes; it's the sex chromosomes that matter.

So the correct answer should be H: The presence of the Y chromosome determines that an individual will be male.

The mechanism of sex determination in humans relies on the presence of the Y chromosome, which determines maleness. Females have two X chromosomes (XX), while males have one X and one Y (XY). The Y chromosome triggers the development of male characteristics.
