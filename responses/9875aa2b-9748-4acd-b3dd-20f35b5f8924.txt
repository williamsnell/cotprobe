Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find i(0⁺) given the Laplace transform of i(t), which is I(s). The expression for I(s) is given as (E - V(0⁺)) divided by [R times (s + (1/(RC)))].

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on Laplace transforms, but I remember that to find the time domain function i(t), I might need to take the inverse Laplace transform of I(s). Once I have i(t), evaluating it at t=0⁺ should give me i(0⁺).

Let me write down I(s) again: I(s) = (E - V(0⁺)) / [R(s + 1/(RC))]. Wait, that denominator is R multiplied by (s + 1/(RC)). So I can factor out the R, making it R*(s + 1/(RC)). So I can rewrite I(s) as (E - V(0⁺)) / [R * (s + 1/(RC))].

I think I can simplify this expression. Let's see, 1/(RC) is a constant. So the denominator is R*(s + α), where α is 1/(RC). Now, I recall that the Laplace transform of an exponential function is something like 1/(s + a) corresponds to e^(-at). But wait, I'm trying to find the inverse Laplace of I(s) to get i(t).

So, I(s) = (E - V(0⁺)) / [R*(s + 1/(RC))]. Let me factor out the constants. Let me rewrite this as [ (E - V(0⁺)) / R ] multiplied by 1/(s + 1/(RC)). Because 1/(s + a) is the Laplace transform of e^(-at)u(t), where u(t) is the unit step function.

So, the inverse Laplace transform of 1/(s + a) is e^(-at). Therefore, the inverse of I(s) would be [ (E - V(0⁺)) / R ] * e^(-t/(RC)).

Wait, because a is 1/(RC), so t/(RC) is the exponent. So i(t) = [ (E - V(0⁺)) / R ] * e^(-t/(RC)) * u(t).

Now, I need to find i(0⁺), which is the value of i(t) as t approaches 0 from the positive side. Since the exponential function e^(-t/(RC)) approaches e^0, which is 1, as t approaches 0. So i(0⁺) is [ (E - V(0⁺)) / R ] * 1.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. At t=0⁺, the exponential term is 1, so i(0⁺) = [E - V(0⁺)] / R.

Looking at the options, I see option J is (E - V(0⁺))/R, and option A is E/(V(0⁺)*R), which doesn't match. Option B is (v(0⁺) - E)/R, which would be negative of what I have. So I think J is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I make any mistake in the inverse Laplace? I(s) is (E - V(0⁺))/(R(s + 1/(RC))). So the inverse is (E - V(0⁺))/R multiplied by e^(-t/(RC)) because L{e^(-at)} = 1/(s + a). So yes, that's correct.

Therefore, i(0⁺) is [E - V(0⁺)]/R, which is option J.

The Laplace transform of i(t) is given as I(s) = (E - V(0⁺)) / [R(s + 1/(RC))]. To find i(0⁺), we take the inverse Laplace transform of I(s). The term 1/(s + a) corresponds to e^(-at), so i(t) = [(E - V(0⁺))/R] * e^(-t/(RC)). Evaluating this at t = 0⁺ gives i(0⁺) = (E - V(0⁺))/R, which matches option J.

Answer: J
