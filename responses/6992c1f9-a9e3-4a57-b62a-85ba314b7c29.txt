Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read it carefully. The question is asking about the primary purpose of a certain term, which is to obtain detailed information about job requirements in order to facilitate decisions related to compensation. The options are A through J, each representing a different HR term.

Hmm, let's break down the question. The key here is that the primary purpose is to get detailed job info for compensation decisions. So, I'm thinking about what each of these options does.

Option A is performance review. I know performance reviews are about evaluating how well an employee is doing in their current role, assessing their performance, maybe giving feedback, promotions, or training. That's not really about getting job requirements for compensation.

Option B is job analysis. Job analysis is the process of determining what a job entailsâ€”like the tasks, responsibilities, skills needed, and so on. This sounds relevant because knowing the job details helps in setting compensation, like determining salary ranges based on the job's demands.

Option C is job description. A job description is a document that outlines the key aspects of a job, including duties, responsibilities, and maybe even the work environment. While it's related to job analysis, I think the job description is more about the output of the analysis rather than the process itself. So the question is about the purpose, which is more about the process of getting the information, so maybe B is better.

Option D is organizational analysis. That's more about the structure, functions, and processes within an organization. It's broader and not specifically about individual jobs, so probably not related to compensation decisions for specific roles.

Option E is workforce analysis. This would involve looking at the composition of the workforce, maybe planning for future needs. It's more about the employees and their distribution rather than individual job requirements.

Option F is employee orientation. That's about introducing new employees to the organization and their roles. Doesn't seem related to compensation decisions.

Option G is recruitment process. Recruitment is about finding and hiring people. While job descriptions are used in recruitment, the primary purpose here is about compensation, so maybe not the best fit.

Option H is job evaluation. Job evaluation is the process of determining the relative value of a job within an organization, often to establish a fair pay structure. This sounds similar to job analysis because it uses the information from the job analysis to evaluate and set compensation. But wait, the question is about obtaining the job requirements, which is more the job analysis part. Job evaluation uses that data to assign a value, so maybe B is the primary purpose here.

Option I is employee survey. That's about gathering employee opinions or feedback, which can inform various HR decisions but not specifically about job requirements for compensation.

Option J is needs assessment. This is typically used in training and development to identify skill gaps, not directly related to compensation based on job requirements.

So, putting it together. The question is about obtaining detailed job info for compensation decisions. Job analysis (B) is about gathering that information. Job evaluation (H) uses that info to set compensation. So the primary purpose is the job analysis, because it's about getting the detailed info necessary, which then informs the job evaluation process for compensation.

Therefore, the answer should be B: job analysis.

The primary purpose of a job analysis is to gather detailed information about job requirements, which is essential for making informed decisions regarding compensation.
