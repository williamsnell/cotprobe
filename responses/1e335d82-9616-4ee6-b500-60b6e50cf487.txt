Question:

Give a list of the character set used inPL/I. Also define the term'variable', and explain what is meant by an 'assign-ment statement'.

Options:

A: 70 different characters, variable is constant, assignment statement assigns a variable to a value
B: 50 different characters, variable can't vary, assignment statement assigns a variable to a function
C: 85 different characters, variable is a label for a value, assignment statement updates the value of a variable without changing the label
D: 90 different characters, variable is a fixed point in memory, assignment statement creates a new variable
E: 65 different characters, variable holds temporary data, assignment statement links two variables
F: 55 different characters, variable can change type, assignment statement copies a function's output to a variable
G: 75 different characters, variable represents a specific type, assignment statement changes the type of a variable
H: 80 different characters, variable is a function, assignment statement assigns a function to a variable
I: 60 different characters, variable can vary, assignment statement assigns a value to a variable
J: 100 different characters, variable is a placeholder, assignment statement transfers data from one variable to another

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about PL/I, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me break it down step by step.

The question has three parts: first, the character set used in PL/I, then the definition of a variable, and finally what an assignment statement does. I need to pick the correct option from A to J that covers all three parts correctly.

Starting with the character set. From what I remember, PL/I uses a specific set of characters for its syntax. I think it's more than 50 but less than 100. I recall that PL/I includes letters, digits, and some special symbols. Maybe around 60 or 70? Let me think: letters (uppercase and lowercase?), digits 0-9, and then symbols like +, -, *, /, =, <, >, etc. Wait, I'm not sure about the exact number. I think it's around 64 or so, but maybe the options have different numbers. Let me check the options: options include 50, 65, 70, 80, 85, 90, 100. I'm not certain, but I might come back to this after looking at the other parts.

Next, the definition of a variable. A variable in programming is typically a storage location that holds a value, which can change during the program's execution. So, the variable itself can vary, holding different values at different times. Looking at the options, I see options where variable is a constant (A), can't vary (B), holds temporary data (E), is a placeholder (J), can vary (I), is a label (C), is a function (H), represents a type (G), is fixed in memory (D), or can change type (F). Since variables are supposed to hold values that can change, the correct option should say the variable can vary. That would point to option I, which says "variable can vary."

Now, the assignment statement. This is a statement that gives a value to a variable. So, it's about assigning a value to the variable. Looking at the options, the assignment parts are: assigns a variable to a value (A), assigns a function to a variable (H), updates the value without changing the label (C), creates a new variable (D), links two variables (E), copies function output to variable (F), changes type (G), assigns a value (I), transfers data (J). So, the assignment statement should assign a value to a variable. Option I says "assignment statement assigns a value to a variable," which sounds correct.

Putting it all together: the correct option should have a reasonable number of characters, state that variables can vary, and that assignment statements assign values to variables. Looking back at the options:

Option I: 60 different characters, variable can vary, assignment statement assigns a value to a variable.

Wait, but earlier I thought the character set was higher. Let me think again. PL/I's character set includes letters (uppercase and lowercase?), digits, and symbols. I think the exact number is 64. Hmm, but none of the options say 64. The closest is option F at 55, E at 65, I at 60. Maybe 64 rounds to 65? Or perhaps the actual number is 64, but the options have 65 or 60. Alternatively, maybe it's 65, which is option E, but option E's variable definition is about temporary data, which doesn't fit. So, perhaps the correct number is 65. But wait, option I says 60. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the character set. PL/I uses letters (A-Z, a-z?), digits (0-9), and a set of special symbols. The total number of characters is 64. But since the options don't have 64, perhaps the closest is 65 (option E) or 60 (option I). Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong about the number, and the correct number is 65. But option I's description of the variable is correct.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up the exact count. Maybe the correct answer is I: 60 different characters, variable can vary, assignment assigns a value. Or perhaps option C? No, option C says the assignment updates the value without changing the label, which is correct because variables are labels. But the variable part in option C says it's a label for a value, which is accurate. So, let me reconsider.

Option C: 85 different characters, variable is a label for a value, assignment statement updates the value without changing the label.

But earlier I thought the character count was around 60-65. 85 seems high. So maybe that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I, with 60 characters, variable can vary, assignment assigns a value.

Alternatively, maybe the character count is 85. Wait, I think PL/I's character set includes more than that. Wait, no, I'm not sure. Let me think: letters (26 uppercase, 26 lowercase, maybe?), digits (10), and perhaps around 40 symbols. That would be 26+26+10 + maybe 40 = 102, which is higher than any option. Hmm, that can't be right. Maybe PL/I doesn't allow lowercase letters? Or perhaps I'm mistaken.

Alternatively, maybe the correct number is 65. So, option E says 65, but the variable part is about temporary data, which isn't correct. So, perhaps the correct answer is I, which has 60, variable can vary, and assignment assigns a value.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck on the character count. Maybe I should focus more on the variable and assignment parts first, as they are more clear.

So, variable can vary: options I, F, maybe C. Assignment assigns a value: I, C, etc.

Looking at the options, option I says variable can vary and assignment assigns a value, which fits. So, if the character count in I is 60, but I'm not sure if that's correct, but the other parts fit.

Alternatively, option C says 85 characters, variable is a label (which is correct), assignment updates the value without changing the label (also correct). So, if the character count is 85, then option C would be correct. But I'm not sure about the count.

Wait, I think I remember that PL/I's character set includes 64 different characters. So, none of the options have 64, but the closest higher is 65 (option E) and lower is 60 (option I). Since 64 is closer to 65, perhaps option E is correct. But option E says variable holds temporary data, which doesn't fit. So, maybe the correct count is 60, making option I correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should accept that the correct answer is I, as the variable and assignment parts fit, and perhaps the character count is 60.

Wait, another thought: maybe the number of different characters is 64, but the options don't have that. So, perhaps the correct answer is I, with 60, even if it's not exact, because the other parts are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C, with 85 characters, but that seems high. I'm not sure.

Another angle: the definition of a variable. A variable is a storage location that can hold a value which can change. So, variable can vary, which is option I. So, focusing on that, option I is correct for the variable part.

The assignment statement assigns a value to a variable, which is also correct in option I.

So, putting it together, option I: 60 different characters, variable can vary, assignment assigns a value. So, I think the answer is I.

The correct answer is **I**: 60 different characters, variable can vary, assignment statement assigns a value to a variable.

**Answer: I**
