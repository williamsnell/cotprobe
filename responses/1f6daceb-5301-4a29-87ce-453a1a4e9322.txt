Alright, so I've got this question about an ideal gas expanding according to the law pV² = Const. Hmm, I need to figure out whether the gas gets hotter or colder when it expands. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that for an ideal gas, the behavior can be described by the ideal gas law, which is PV = nRT. But this question gives a different relation: pV² = constant. So that's not the usual PV = nRT, but a modified version. I need to analyze how temperature changes with expansion under this condition.

Let me write down the given condition: pV² = C, where C is a constant. So, if the gas expands, the volume V increases. That means, according to this equation, the pressure p must decrease because V is getting larger, and p is inversely proportional to V squared.

Now, I'm trying to find out what happens to the temperature T. From the ideal gas law, T is proportional to pV/nR. So, if I can express p in terms of V using the given condition, I can substitute it into the temperature equation.

From pV² = C, I can solve for p: p = C / V². Now, plugging this into the ideal gas equation, T = (pV)/(nR) = (C/V² * V) / (nR) = (C)/(V n R). So, T is proportional to 1/V.

Wait, so as the volume V increases, 1/V decreases, which means T decreases. That implies the temperature is getting lower as the gas expands. So the gas should get colder.

But wait a second, I should double-check if I did that correctly. Let me go through it again. Given pV² = C, so p = C/V². Substitute into T: T = (pV)/nR = (C/V² * V) / (nR) = C/(V n R). Yep, that's correct. So T is inversely proportional to V. So when V increases, T decreases. So the gas gets colder.

Looking at the options, option I is "colder," which seems to match. But I should look at the other options to make sure there's no trick here. Option E says it gets colder, but only under low pressure. Is that a factor here? Well, the condition given is pV² = C, which is a specific process, not dependent on the absolute pressure or volume magnitude beyond that relation. So the conclusion should hold regardless of whether the pressure is high or low, as long as the process follows pV² = C.

Option I is a straightforward choice here. So I think the correct answer is I: colder.

The gas gets colder when it expands because, under the condition pV² = constant, the pressure decreases more rapidly than the volume increases, leading to a drop in temperature according to the ideal gas law.
