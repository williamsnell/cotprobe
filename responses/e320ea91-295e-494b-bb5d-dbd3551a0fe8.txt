Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about displacement current. Hmm, displacement current... I remember it's related to changing electric fields, right? Maxwell introduced it to modify Ampère's Law. The formula, I think, is I_d = ε₀ * (dΦ_E/dt), where Φ_E is the electric flux.

The problem says a small metallic ball is charged sinusoidally, both positively and negatively, at 60 cycles per second. The maximum charge is 10^-6 coulombs. We need to find the displacement current for this frequency and then when the frequency is 10^6 cps.

Wait, wait. So the charge varies sinusoidally, meaning it's Q = Q_max * sin(ωt), right? Since it's alternating, the charge goes positive and negative. The displacement current depends on the rate of change of charge, I think. Oh wait, no, displacement current is the rate of change of electric flux, but in this case, since the ball is isolated, the flux through its surface is due to the charge. So Φ_E = Q_enc / ε₀. So dΦ_E/dt = dQ/dt / ε₀. Therefore, displacement current I_d = ε₀ * (dΦ_E/dt) = ε₀ * (dQ/dt / ε₀) = dQ/dt. Oh, so I_d is just the time derivative of the charge.

Wait, but displacement current is dΦ_E/dt times ε₀. Alternatively, since Φ_E = Q/(ε₀), then dΦ_E/dt = (dQ/dt)/ε₀. So I_d = ε₀ * (dΦ_E/dt) = ε₀ * (dQ/dt)/(ε₀) )= dQ/dt. So displacement current I_d equals the time derivative of the charge.

So the displacement current is the same as the current in this scenario? Or is it different? Wait no, displacement current doesn't require actual movement of charge, just a changing E-field. But the formula I_d = dQ/dt holds here because the flux depends on Q.

Wait, but wait another moment. The displacement current is given by I_d = ε₀ * (dE/dt) * A, where A is the area. Alternatively, when the charge is varying sinusoidally, the current I_d would be the rate of change of charge, which is dQ/dt.

Given that, the maximum displacement current occurs when dQ/dt is maximum. So for a sinusoidal charge varying as Q = Q_max * sin(ωt), the derivative dQ/dt is Q_max * ω * cos(ωt). The maximum value of this is Q_max * ω.

So I_d_max = Q_max * ω.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, the displacement current is the time derivative of the electric flux, which in turn depends on the charge. So, I_d = dΦ_E/dt = (dQ/dt)/ε₀. But earlier, I thought I_d = dQ/dt. Hmm, maybe I got confused.

Wait no, no. Let's correct that. The electric flux Φ_E = E * A, where E is the electric field. For a charged conducting sphere, the electric field outside is the same as if the charge were a point charge. So E = Q/(4πε₀ r²). But the displacement current is the rate of change of the electric flux through a surface, which in Maxwell's equations is used for Ampère's Law in differential form. But in this case, perhaps we can model it as the flux through the surface of the sphere itself.

Wait, but the sphere's surface has a charge that's changing. So the electric flux through the surface of the sphere is Φ_E = Q/(ε₀). Because from Gauss's Law, the flux is Q_enc / ε₀. So then, dΦ_E/dt = (dQ/dt)/ ε₀. Therefore, displacement current I_d = ε₀ * (dΦ_E/dt) ) = ε₀ * (dQ/dt)/ ε₀ )= dQ/dt.

So yes, I_d = dQ/dt. So the maximum displacement current is when dQ/dt is maximum.

Now, Q varies sinusoidally as Q = Q_max * sin(ωt). So dQ/dt = Q_max * ω * cos(ωt). The maximum value of dQ/dt is Q_max * ω.

So for the first case, f = 60 cps (Hz), so ω = 2πf = 2π * 60 ≈ 376.99 rad/s.

Given Q_max = 1e-6 C.

So I_d_max = 1e-6 * 376.99 ≈ 3.7699e-4 A, which is about 3.77e-4 A.

Wait, but the options are in A, and the first part of the question is for 60 cps, the second for 1e6 cps.

Wait, let's compute for both frequencies.

First case: f=60 Hz, ω=2π*60 ≈ 376.99 rad/s.

I_d = Q_max * ω = 1e-6 * 377 ≈ 3.77e-4 A.

Second case: f=1e6 Hz, ω=2πe6 ≈ 6.28e6 rad/s.

I_d = 1e-6 * 6.28e6 = 6.28 A.

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 3.77e-4 A, 6.28 A.

Yes, that's exactly what we got.

Wait, another option is E: 3.77e-3, 6.28e1. No, because 6.28e1 is 62.8, which is higher.

Option C is the first part 3.77e-4, second 6.28, which matches our calculation.

So the correct answer should be option C.

The displacement current is calculated using the formula \( I_d = \frac{dQ}{dt} \), where \( Q \) is the charge varying sinusoidally. For a sinusoidal charge \( Q = Q_{\text{max}} \sin(\omega t) \), the maximum displacement current occurs when \( \frac{dQ}{dt} \) is maximum, which is \( I_d = Q_{\text{max}} \omega \). 

For \( f = 60 \, \text{Hz} \), \( \omega = 2\pi f \approx 377 \, \text{rad/s} \), so:
\[
I_d = 10^{-6} \times 377 \approx 3.77 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{A}.
\]

For \( f = 10^6 \, \text{Hz} \), \( \omega = 2\pi \times 10^6 \approx 6.28 \times 10^6 \, \text{rad/s} \), so:
\[
I_d = 10^{-6} \times 6.28 \times 10^6 = 6.28 \, \text{A}.
\]

The correct answer is **C: \( 3.77 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{A}, 6.28 \, \text{A} \)**.
