Okay, so I need to calculate the frequency of the light emitted by a helium-neon laser, which is used in supermarket scanners. The wavelength given is 632.8 nm. Hmm, I remember that the relationship between the speed of light, wavelength, and frequency is given by the equation c = λν, where c is the speed of light, λ is the wavelength, and ν is the frequency. 

Wait, right, the speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 3.00 x 10^8 meters per second. But wait, does this apply here? Since the laser is emitting light, I think the speed of light in a vacuum would be the right value to use, unless it's in another medium, but since the problem doesn't specify, I'll assume it's in a vacuum.

So, the wavelength is given in nanometers. I need to convert that to meters because the units should match. 1 nm is 1 x 10^-9 meters. So, 632.8 nm would be 632.8 x 10^-9 meters, which is 6.328 x 10^-7 meters. Let me write that down: λ = 632.8 nm = 632.8 x 10^-9 m = 6.328 x 10^-7 m.

Now, the equation is ν = c / λ. Plugging in the numbers: ν = (3.00 x 10^8 m/s) / (6.328 x 10^-7 m). Let me compute this. 

First, let's handle the exponents. 10^8 divided by 10^-7 is 10^15 because 8 - (-7) = 15. So, the 3.00 divided by 6.328 is approximately what? Let me calculate that. 3 divided by 6.328. Let's see, 6.328 times 0.475 is roughly 3 because 6.328 * 0.475 = approx 3 (because 6.328 * 0.5 = 3.164, which is a bit higher). So maybe around 0.475. 

So, 3/6.328 ≈ 0.475. Therefore, ν ≈ 0.475 x 10^15 Hz. Wait, but 0.475 x 10^15 is the same as 4.75 x 10^14 Hz. Let me double-check that calculation because sometimes I might make a mistake with the decimal points.

Wait another way: 3 divided by 6.328. Let me do it more accurately. 6.328 times 0.47 is 6.328 * 0.4 = 2.5312, plus 6.328*0.07=0.44296, so total 2.97416. That's less than 3. So, 6.328 * 0.47 = ~2.97416. The difference is 3 - 2.97416 = 0.02584. So how much more do I need? 0.02584 / 6.328 ≈ 0.004083. So total is 0.47 + 0.004083 ≈ 0.474083. So 3/6.328 ≈ 0.4741. So ν ≈ 0.4741 x 10^15 Hz = 4.741 x 10^14 Hz. 

Looking at the options, I see option I is 4.738 x 10^14 Hz, which is very close to my calculation. Let me check if I did everything right. 

Wait, another approach: Let me compute 3e8 / 632.8e-9. Because 632.8e-9 m is the same as 632.8 * 1e-9. So, 3e8 divided by 632.8e-9. Let's compute that numerically.

3e8 is 300,000,000. 632.8e-9 is 0.0000006328. Wait, but when I divide 3e8 by 632.8e-9, it's the same as 3e8 / (632.8 * 1e-9) )= 3e8 / (632.8e-9) )= (3e8) / (6.328e-7) )= 3e8 /6.328e-7.

Wait, 3e8 is 3 * 10^8, and 6.328e-7 is 6.328 * 10^-7. So 3e8 /6.328e-7 = (3/6.328) * (10^8 / 10^-7) )= (0.4741) * 10^15 = 4.741e14 Hz. So yes, that's 4.741 x 10^14 Hz, which matches option I (4.738 x 10^14 Hz). Close enough, considering rounding.

Wait, but the options don't have 4.741, but I is 4.738. Hmm. Let me recalculate more accurately.

Let me compute 3 divided by 632.8 exactly. Wait, no, because I converted 632.8 nm to 6.328e-7 m. So 3e8 / 6.328e-7 = (3e8)/(6.328e-7). Let me compute this step by step.

3e8 is 300,000,000. 6.328e-7 is 0.0000006328. So 300,000,000 divided by 0.0000006328. Alternatively, 300,000,000 / 0.0000006328 = 300,000,000 * (1/0.0000006328) ). Let's compute 1/0.0000006328. 

1/0.0000006328 is the same as 1 / (6.328e-7) )= approximately 1,580,000 (since 6.328e-7 is 0.0000006328, and 1 / 0.0000006328 ≈ 1,580,000). Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 1 / 0.0000006328 = 1 / (6.328e-7) )= (1e7)/6.328 ≈ 10,000,000 / 6.328 ≈ let's calculate that: 6.328 * 1,580,000 = 6.328 * 1.58e6 = let's see, 6.328 * 1.58e6.

Wait, maybe a better way is to compute 10,000,000 / 6.328.

6.328 * 1,580,000 = 6.328 * 1.58e6 = 6.328 * 1.58e6.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator approach: 6.328 × 1.58e6 = 6.328 * 1,580,000.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 10,000,000 ÷ 6.328.

Let me compute 6.328 * 1,580,000 = ?

Wait, 6.328 * 1,580,000 = 6.328 * 1.58e6.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me just compute 10,000,000 ÷ 6.328 ≈ 1,580,000.

Because 6.328 × 1,580,000 = 6.328 × 1.58e6 = 6.328 × 1.58 × 1e6.

6.328 × 1.58 = let's compute that:

6 * 1.58 = 9.48
0.328 * 1.58 ≈ 0.51744
Total ≈ 9.48 + 0.51744 = 9.99744, approximately 10.

So 6.328 × 1.58e6 ≈ 10 × 1e6 = 1e7.

So, 10,000,000 ÷ 6.328 ≈ 1.58e6.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, because 6.328 × 1.58e6 ≈ 10e6, which is 10,000,000. So 10e6 ÷6.328≈ 1.58e6.

Wait, so 1e7 (10,000,000) ÷ 6.328 ≈ ~1,580,000.

Wait, but 6.328 × 1,580,000 = 6.328 × 1.58e6 = 6.328 × 1.58 × 1e6. Let me compute 6.328 × 1.58.

6 * 1.58 = 9.48
0.328 * 1.58 = let's compute that:
0.3 * 1.58 = 0.474
0.028 * 1.58 ≈ 0.04424
So total ≈ 0.474 + 0.04424 = 0.51824
So total 6.328 × 1.58 ≈ 9.48 + 0.51824 = 9.99824, which is approximately 10, so 6.328 × 1.58e6 = approx 10e6, which is 10,000,000.

So, 10,000,000 ÷6.328 ≈ 1,580,000.

So, 1 / (6.328e-7) )= approx 1,580,000.

So, 3e8 = 300,000,000. Multiply by 1,580,000.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the initial calculation was ν = (3e8) / (6.328e-7) = (3e8) * (1 / (6.328e-7)) )= 3e8 * 1.58e6.

Wait, wait, no, that's wrong because 1/(6.328e-7) = approx 1.58e6, as we found. So 3e8 * 1.58e6 = 3 * 1.58 * 1e14 = 4.74e14 Hz.

Wait, so 3 * 1.58 is 4.74, so 4.74 x 10^14 Hz, which matches what I had earlier.

Looking back at the options, option I is 4.738 x 10^14 Hz. That's very close. So I think the correct answer is I.

Wait, but let me check the initial wavelength again. It's 632.8 nm. So 632.8 x 1e-9 m is correct. Did I make any miscalculations?

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach. Let me compute 3.00e8 / 632.8e-9.

Compute 3e8 / 632.8e-9.

First, 3e8 is 300,000,000.

632.8e-9 is 0.0000006328.

So, 300,000,000 / 0.0000006328 = ?

Let me compute this division step by step.

Well, 300,000,000 divided by 0.0000006328.

We can write this as 300,000,000 / 0.0000006328 = 300,000,000 ÷ 6.328e-7.

Which is the same as (3e8) / (6.328e-7) = (3 / 6.328) ) * (1e8 / 1e-7) )= (0.4741) * (1e15) )= 4.741e14 Hz.

So, approximately 4.741 x 10^14 Hz, which is very close to option I: 4.738 x 10^14 Hz.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the exact division. Let me compute 3e8 / 632.8e-9.

Alternatively, 3e8 = 300,000,000 m/s.

632.8 nm = 632.8 x 1e-9 m = 6.328e-7 m.

So, ν = 3e8 / 6.328e-7.

Let me compute this as 300,000,000 / 0.0000006328.

If I use a calculator, 300,000,000 ÷ 0.0000006328 = ?

Let me think numerically.

0.0000006328 × 474,100,000 = ?

Wait, 0.0000006328 × 4.741e8 = 0.0000006328 * 474,100,000 = let's compute 474,100,000 * 0.0000006328.

474,100,000 * 0.0000006328 = 474,100,000 * 6.328e-7.

Which is 474,100,000 * 6.328e-7 = (4.741e8) * (6.328e-7) )= 4.741 *6.328 * 1e1. Because 1e8 *1e-7=1e1.

4.741 *6.328 = let's compute that.

4 *6=24

4 *0.328=1.312

0.741 *6=4.446

0.741 *0.328≈0.243.

Adding all together: 24 +1.312 =25.312, +4.446=29.758, +0.243≈30.001.

So, 4.741 *6.328 ≈30.001. So, 4.741e8 *6.328e-7 =30.001e1=300.01. Wait, but that's not correct because 4.741e8 *6.328e-7 = (4.741 *6.328) *1e1 = approx 30.001*10=300.01. But that's way off because 0.0000006328 *474,100,000 = 0.0000006328 *4.741e8 = 0.0000006328 *474,100,000.

Wait, let me compute 0.0000006328 ×474,100,000.

0.0000006328 ×474,100,000 = 0.0000006328 ×4.741e8.

So, 0.0000006328 ×4.741e8 = (6.328e-7) *4.741e8 = 6.328 *4.741 *1e1.

Because 1e-7 *1e8=1e1.

6.328 *4.741 ≈ let's compute that.

6 *4=24.

6*0.741=4.446.

0.328*4=1.312.

0.328*0.741≈0.243.

Adding all: 24 +4.446=28.446 +1.312=29.758 +0.243≈30.001.

So, 6.328 *4.741≈30.001. So, 30.001 *1e1=300.01.

But wait, 0.0000006328 ×474,100,000 =300.01, so that would mean 474,100,000 is the correct frequency because 3e8 /6.328e-7 =474,100,000 Hz =4.741e8 Hz? Wait, no, wait, that can't be. Because 4.741e8 Hz is 474 million Hz, which is 4.741 x 10^8 Hz. But wait, that's not right because I'm getting confused with the exponents.

Wait, no, I think I messed up. Because 3e8 divided by 6.328e-7 is (3e8)/(6.328e-7)= (3/6.328) * (1e8/1e-7)= (0.4741)*(1e15)=4.741e14 Hz.

Ah, right, because 1e8 divided by 1e-7 is 1e15. So the result is 4.741e14 Hz, which is approximately 4.741 x 10^14 Hz.

Looking back at the options, option I is 4.738 x10^14 Hz, which is very close. So I think that's the correct answer.
</think>

To calculate the frequency of light emitted by the helium-neon laser, we use the equation:

\[
\nu = \frac{c}{\lambda}
\]

where \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \mathrm{m/s} \)) and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength (\( 632.8 \, \mathrm{nm} \)). Converting \( \lambda \) to meters:

\[
\lambda = 632.8 \, \mathrm{nm} = 632.8 \times 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{m} = 6.328 \times 10^{-7} \, \mathrm{m}.
\]

Substituting into the equation:

\[
\nu = \frac{3.00 \times 10^8}{6.328 \times 10^{-7}} = \frac{3.00}{6.328} \times 10^{8 - (-7)} = 0.4741 \times 10^{15} \, \mathrm{Hz} = 4.741 \times 10^{14} \, \mathrm{Hz}.
\]

Comparing this result with the options, the closest value is:

**I: \( 4.738 \times 10^{14} \, \mathrm{Hz} \).**

Thus, the correct answer is:

I
