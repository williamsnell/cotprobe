Okay, so I have this question about electromagnetic waves, specifically about finding the magnitude of the electric field E given the magnetic field H. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that in a plane wave in free space, the electric and magnetic fields are related. I think the basic relationship involves the speed of light or the impedance of free space. Oh right, the impedance of free space is a key concept here. Wait, what's the impedance of free space again? I think it's about 377 ohms. Yeah, that's the number I remember. So Z0 is approximately 377 ohms.

Now, the impedance of free space relates E and H. The formula, if I recall correctly, is E = Z0 * H. Because in a plane wave, the ratio of E to H is the impedance. So E equals the impedance multiplied by H.

In this problem, H is given as 5 amps per meter. Wait, no, wait a second. Amps per meter? Oh, wait no, H is in amps per meter? Or is it tesla? No, wait. Wait, the unit for H is usually ampere per meter (A/m) because it's the magnetic field intensity. So yes, H is 5 A/m.

So plugging into the formula, E should be Z0 multiplied by H. So E = 377 ohms * 5 A/m. Let me calculate that. 377 times 5 is... let's see, 300*5 is 1500, and 77*5 is 385, so total is 1500+385=1885. Hmm, but looking at the options, option C is 1883 volts/meter. That's very close. Maybe I should double-check the exact value of the impedance of free space.

Wait, I think the impedance of free space is exactly 120π ohms. Let me compute that. Pi is approximately 3.1416, so 120 * 3.1416 ≈ 376.99 ohms, which is about 377 ohms. So 120π is more precise. So using 120π, then E = 120π * 5.

Calculating 120 * π first: 120 * 3.14159265 ≈ 376.991. So 376.991 * 5 = 1884.955 volts per meter. Hmm, the options have 1883 as option C. That's a bit off. Maybe the question uses a rounded value. Alternatively, perhaps the exact value is 377, so 377 *5=1885, which would be close to option C, 1883. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, maybe I should think again. Is the formula E = Z0 * H or E = (Z0) * H? Yes, that's correct. Because in a plane wave, E and H are perpendicular, and their ratio is the impedance. So E = Z0 * H.

Wait, maybe I should check the units again. E is in volts per meter (V/m), H is in A/m, and Z0 is in ohms (Ω). So when you multiply Ω by A/m, you get (Ω·A/m) = (V/A) * (A/m) = V/m. So the units match, which is correct.

So E = 377 *5 = 1885 V/m. But the options don't have 1885, the closest is C:1883. Maybe I should check if I used the correct value for Z0. Wait, another thought: sometimes the impedance of free space is given as 120π, which is approximately 376.99, but sometimes approximated as 377. So 377 *5 is 1885, but perhaps the options used 376.73 or something else.

Wait, looking at the options, option H is 376.7 V/m. That's the value of Z0, not E. So that's probably not it. Option C is 1883, which is very close to 1885. Maybe the calculation in the options used a slightly different approximation for π. Let's see, 120 * π is exactly 376.991118... So 376.991 *5 = 1884.955. That's approximately 1885, but option C is 1883. Hmm, perhaps there's a rounding difference. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: sometimes the relation between E and H in a wave is given by E = c * μ0 * H, but I think that's equivalent to E = Z0 * H because Z0 = μ0 * c. Alternatively, maybe I should use the relation E = (μ0 * c) * H. Let me think, c is the speed of light, which is approximately 3e8 m/s. And μ0 is 4π×10^-7 H/m.

So E = μ0 * c * H. Let's compute that: μ0 =4πe-7, c=3e8. So 4πe-7 *3e8 = 12πe1 = 12*3.1416*10 = approximately 376.99, same as before. So 376.99 *5 = 1884.95, which rounds to 1885. So the closest option is C:1883, but that's a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe the question is using E = (1/μ0) * H. No, that can't be right because the units wouldn't match. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is E = (μ0/ε0) * H, which is Z0. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should check the options again. Option C is 1883, which is close to 1885. Perhaps the options used a different approximation for π, say 3.14 instead of 3.1416. Let's see: 120 *3.14 = 376.8. Then 376.8 *5=1884. So it's 1884, which is still closer to 1885. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to use the exact value of 377, so 377 *5=1885, but the options have 1883. Maybe a typo? Or perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is asking for the magnitude of E in a different medium, but no, the question states it's in free space, so Z0 should be 377 ohms. So I think option C is the intended answer, even though the exact calculation gives 1885. Maybe the options rounded down or used a slightly different value for Z0.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, another approach: the relation between E and H in a plane wave is E = Z0 * H. So E = 377 *5 = 1885 V/m. The closest option is C:1883. So perhaps the options used 376.6 *5=1883. Let me check: 376.6 *5=1883. So maybe they used Z0 as 376.6, which is a rounded value. So the answer would be option C:1883 V/m.

To determine the magnitude of the electric field \( E \) for a plane wave in free space given the magnetic field \( H = 5 \, \text{A/m} \), we use the relationship between \( E \) and \( H \) in free space, which is \( E = Z_0 \cdot H \), where \( Z_0 \) is the impedance of free space. The impedance of free space is approximately \( Z_0 = 377 \, \Omega \).

Substituting the given values:
\[
E = 377 \, \Omega \cdot 5 \, \text{A/m} = 1885 \, \text{V/m}.
\]

The closest option to this calculated value is **1883 V/m**, which corresponds to option C. Minor discrepancies may arise due to rounding or approximations in the impedance value.
