Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find out how many ways there are to divide a set of 6 elements into 3 non-empty ordered subsets. The options are from A to J, with various numbers. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on combinatorics, but let me try to work this out step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the question correctly. We have a set with 6 distinct elements, and we want to split it into 3 subsets. Each subset must be non-empty, and the order of the subsets matters. So, for example, if the subsets are A, B, and C, then the order matters, meaning that putting element 1 in subset A and element 2 in subset B is different from putting element 1 in B and element 2 in A.

Now, I remember that when the order of the subsets doesn't matter, this is a problem of partitioning a set into non-empty subsets, and the number of ways is given by the Stirling numbers of the second kind. But in this case, since the subsets are ordered, the Stirling number alone won't be enough. I think I need to multiply by the number of permutations of the subsets.

Let me recall: The formula for the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty, unordered subsets is the Stirling number of the second kind, denoted S(n, k). But when the subsets are ordered, each partition corresponds to k! times the Stirling number because each partition can be arranged in k! ways. Wait, no, actually, for ordered subsets, it's a different concept. I think it's related to surjective functions.

Oh right! Another approach is to think about functions from the set to the k subsets, but ensuring that each subset is non-empty. Since the subsets are ordered, it's like assigning each element to one of the three subsets, with each subset getting at least one element. So, the number of such functions is equal to the number of onto functions from a set of size 6 to a set of size 3.

The formula for the number of onto functions is given by the inclusion-exclusion principle. The formula is:

Number of onto functions = k! * S(n, k)

Where k is the number of subsets (here, 3), and S(n, k) is the Stirling number of the second kind.

Alternatively, the number can also be calculated using the formula:

Number of onto functions = Σ_{i=0 to k} (-1)^i * C(k, i) * (k - i)^n

Where C(k, i) is the combination of k choose i.

Let me compute this step by step.

Given n=6, k=3.

So using the inclusion-exclusion formula:

Number of onto functions = Σ_{i=0 to 3} (-1)^i * C(3, i) * (3 - i)^6

Let's compute each term:

For i=0: (-1)^0 * C(3,0) * (3-0)^6 = 1 * 1 * 3^6 = 729

For i=1: (-1)^1 * C(3,1) * (3-1)^6 = -1 * 3 * 2^6 = -3 * 64 = -192

For i=2: (-1)^2 * C(3,2) * (3-2)^6 = 1 * 3 * 1^6 = 3 * 1 = 3

For i=3: (-1)^3 * C(3,3) * (3-3)^6 = -1 * 1 * 0^6 = 0

Now, summing these up: 729 - 192 + 3 + 0 = 729 -192 is 537, plus 3 is 540.

So the number of onto functions is 540. That would mean that the number of ways to divide the set into 3 non-empty ordered subsets is 540.

Looking back at the options, D is 540, so that should be the correct answer.

Wait a moment, let me just cross-verify this with another approach to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Another way to think about it is using the multiplication principle. Each element can go into any of the 3 subsets, so without any restrictions, there are 3^6 = 729 ways. But this includes cases where one or more subsets are empty. So we need to subtract those cases.

Alternatively, using the formula for onto functions, which is exactly what I did earlier, leading to 540.

Alternatively, since each element can be assigned to subset 1, 2, or 3, but ensuring none are empty. So the number is 3! * S(6,3).

I remember that S(6,3) is 90. So 3! is 6, so 6 * 90 = 540. Yep, that checks out.

So both methods give me 540. Therefore, the answer should be D.

The number of ways to divide a set of 6 elements into 3 non-empty ordered subsets is calculated using the formula for onto functions, which involves the inclusion-exclusion principle. This results in 540 ways.
