Okay, so I have this question here about Paul owing money to a sporting goods store. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the amount owed is $56.30 plus a 3% sales tax. I think I need to calculate the total amount including the tax. So, 3% of $56.30 would be 0.03 multiplied by 56.30. Let me do that: 0.03 * 56.30 equals... let me see, 56.30 times 0.03 is 1.689. So the total amount before any discounts or terms would be 56.30 + 1.689, which is $57.989. Hmm, that's approximately $57.99.

Now, the terms given are (2/10), (n/30). I remember that these are trade discounts. The notation (2/10, n/30) usually means that there's a 2% discount if paid within 10 days, and if not paid within those 10 days, the balance is due in 30 days. So, the discount is 2% if paid early, otherwise, no discount and the full amount is due at 30 days.

The question says Paul paid one week after the agreement. So, how many days is that? A week is 7 days. Since the discount period is 10 days, Paul paid within those 10 days because 7 is less than 10. Therefore, he's eligible for the 2% discount.

So, I need to calculate 2% off the total amount, which we found to be approximately $57.99. Let me calculate 2% of $57.99. 2% is 0.02, so 0.02 * 57.99 equals about $1.1598. Subtracting that from the total gives 57.99 - 1.1598, which is around $56.8302. So approximately $56.83.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes the order matters. I first added the tax and then applied the discount. Alternatively, maybe the sales tax is applied after the discount? No, I think the way it's presented, it's the amount plus tax, and then the discount is applied to the total. So, the total is 56.30 plus 3%, which is 57.989, then 2% discount on that total.

Let me make sure I did that correctly. 56.30 * 1.03 is indeed 57.989. Then, 57.989 * 0.98 (since 2% off) is 57.989 * 0.98. Let's calculate that: 57.989 * 0.98. 

Breaking it down: 57.989 * 1 = 57.989, minus 57.989 * 0.02 (which is 1.1598). So, 57.989 minus 1.1598 equals approximately 56.8292. So, about $56.83.

Looking at the options, F is $56.86, which is very close to my calculation. I think that's the right answer. But let me check if I made any mistakes. Did I apply the tax correctly? Yes, 3% on the original amount. Did I apply the discount correctly? Yes, 2% off the total. 

Alternatively, maybe the discount is applied before the tax? Let me try that approach just to be thorough. If the original amount is $56.30, and there's a 2% discount, that would be 56.30 * 0.98 = 55.174. Then, adding 3% tax: 55.174 * 1.03. Let's calculate that: 55.174 * 1.03 is 55.174 + (55.174 * 0.03) = 55.174 + 1.65522 = 56.82922, which is about $56.83 again. So that's the same result.

Wait, but if the discount is applied first, the amount becomes $55.174, then tax brings it to about $56.83. Either way, I get the same final amount. So, the correct calculation is either way, giving me around $56.83.

Looking back at the options, F is $56.86, which is the closest to my calculation. The other options are either higher or lower. For example, E is $57.50, which is higher than my amount. H is $58.12, which is even higher. So, F is the best fit.

I think that's the correct answer then. So, Paul paid $56.86.

The total amount owed is $56.30 plus 3% sales tax, totaling approximately $57.99. Since Paul paid within 7 days, he qualifies for a 2% discount, reducing the amount to around $56.83. The closest option is F: $56.86.

Answer: F
