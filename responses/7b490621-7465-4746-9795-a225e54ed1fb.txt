Question:

A school board of a large school district is proposing a new dress code for students. Some students feel that this dress code unfairly targets female students. To see if there is a difference between boys and girls in their opposition to the new dress code, they conduct a poll of 60 randomly selected male and 70 randomly selected female high school students in the district. They find that 66 females oppose the dress code and 50 males oppose the dress code. Which of the following explains why a two-proportion z-test is not appropriate?

Options:

A: There is no alternative hypothesis proposed for this test.
B: The number of successes and the number of failures for the two groups are not all large enough.
C: The shapes of the population distributions are not known.
D: The z-test is not designed for proportions.
E: The sample sizes are too small.
F: The sample sizes are different.
G: The sample wasn't randomly selected.
H: The students who oppose the dress code don't represent the entire population.
I: The sample sizes are too large.
J: The proportions of male and female are not equal.

Answer:

Okay, so I've got this question about why a two-proportion z-test isn't appropriate in a certain situation. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: A school board is proposing a new dress code. Some students feel it targets female students. They polled 60 males and 70 females. 66 females opposed it, 50 males. They want to know if there's a difference in opposition between boys and girls.

The question is asking why a two-proportion z-test isn't suitable here. The options are A through J.

I remember that a two-proportion z-test is used to compare two independent proportions. It checks if there's a significant difference between two groups. But there are certain conditions that need to be met for it to be appropriate.

One of the main conditions is that the sample sizes should be large enough. Specifically, for each group, the number of successes (opponents) and failures (non-opponents) should be at least 10. This is because the normal approximation is used in the z-test, and it works better with larger samples.

Looking at the numbers: They polled 60 males and 70 females. For males, 50 opposed. So, successes are 50, failures are 60-50=10. Wait, that's only 10 failures. For females, 66 opposed, so failures are 70-66=4. Oh, that's way too low.

So the males have 50 successes and 10 failures. The females have 66 successes and 4 failures. Both groups have some low numbers of failures, especially females. I think that's a problem because the rule of thumb is that each group should have np >=10 and n(1-p) >=10, where n is sample size and p is the proportion. Here, for females, n(1-p) is 4, which is less than 10. So the conditions for the z-test aren't met because the sample sizes aren't large enough in terms of both successes and failures.

Looking at the options, option B says the number of successes and failures aren't all large enough. That makes sense. Because even though some groups have enough successes, others don't have enough failures.

Option E says sample sizes are too small. But the sample sizes are 60 and 70, which aren't tiny. The issue is more about the number of successes and failures meeting the criteria, not the overall sample size being too small. So E might not be the best choice.

Option F is about different sample sizes. But two-proportion z-tests can handle different sample sizes; that's not the issue here. So F is not the answer.

Option H says the students who opposed don't represent the population. But the question says the samples were randomly selected, so H isn't correct. Similarly, G says the sample wasn't randomly selected, but the question states they were randomly selected, so G is incorrect.

So the main issue is that for at least one of the groups, the number of failures is too low. Hence, the two-proportion z-test isn't appropriate because the conditions for normal approximation aren't met.
</think>

The two-proportion z-test is not appropriate because the number of successes and failures in one of the groups (females) is too low. Specifically, the females have only 4 failures, which is less than the required 10 for the normal approximation to hold. This violates the assumptions needed for the z-test.

Answer: B
