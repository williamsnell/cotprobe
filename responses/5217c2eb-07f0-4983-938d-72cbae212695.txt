Alright, I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this question about Rawls' theory. Let me start by recalling what I know about John Rawls and his work. Rawls is best known for his book "A Theory of Justice," where he introduced the concept of the original position and the two principles of justice.

So the question is asking about the two parts of Rawls' theory. From what I remember, Rawls' theory has two main principles: the first principle is about equal basic liberties, and the second principle deals with fair equality of opportunity and inequalities only if they benefit the least advantaged. These two principles are part of his theory of justice as fairness.

The options given are A to J, and I need to choose which one correctly describes how the two parts of Rawls' theory relate. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says the two parts can be proven false with logical reasoning. I don't think that's correct because Rawls' theory is more about offering a framework for justice rather than something that can be empirically disproven. It's a normative theory, so logical reasoning alone might not disprove it.

Option B states that the two parts are independent, so you can accept one without the other. Wait, in Rawls' theory, the two principles are presented in order. The first principle has priority over the second. So you can't really accept the second without considering the first. Hence, they aren't independent; you can't accept one without the other in the sense that the first must be satisfied before the second is considered. So B might not be correct.

Option C claims they're based purely on empirical evidence. That doesn't sound right because Rawls' theory is a philosophical construct, not based on empirical data. It's more about what is just rather than what is empirically observed.

Option D says they're not open to debate. That can't be true because Rawls' theory has been widely debated and critiqued in philosophical circles. So D is out.

Option E suggests they can't be justified via rational means. No, Rawls' theory is all about rational justification, especially through the original position and the veil of ignorance. So E is incorrect.

Option F says justification is through emotional appeal. Again, Rawls' approach is rational and logical, so F is wrong.

Option G: based on personal preferences and biases. No, his theory is systematic and not based on personal biases. So G is incorrect.

Option H: dependent on each other but can be accepted separately. Hmm, I think the two principles are in a hierarchy. The first must be satisfied before the second is considered, so they are dependent in that sense, but can they be accepted separately? Maybe in application, but in theory, you have to accept both. Not sure yet.

Option I: interdependent, meaning you can't accept one without the other. This sounds more accurate because the two principles are part of a coherent system. You can't just take the second principle without the first because the first has priority. So you have to accept both as a package; they're interdependent.

Option J: provable from self-evident premises. I don't think Rawls' premises are self-evident. They are constructed through the original position, which is a thought experiment, but not based on self-evident truths. So J is probably wrong.

So, considering all this, I think the correct answer is I: are interdependent; you cannot accept one part without accepting the other. Because Rawls' theory requires both principles to hold, and the second depends on the first.

The correct answer is I: are interdependent: You cannot accept one part without accepting the other.

The two principles of Rawls' theory are part of a coherent system where the first principle (equal basic liberties) has priority over the second (fair equality of opportunity and inequalities benefiting the least advantaged). Therefore, they cannot be accepted separately; they are interdependent.

Answer: I
