Okay, so I have this question about moons of a planet, and I need to figure out which planet Phoebe Dione and Helene belong to. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that moons are natural satellites orbiting a planet. The question gives me a list of options from A to J, each corresponding to a different planet in our solar system.

I know that Saturn is known for having a large number of moons. I think it's the planet with the most moons discovered so far. So that's a hint towards Saturn. Let me see if I can recall any specific moons of Saturn.

I remember that Iapetus is one of Saturn's moons; it's famous for its huge mountain. Then there's Dione and Tethys, which I think are also moons of Saturn. Wait, the question mentions Phoebe and Helene. Hmm, I'm not as sure about those. I think Phoebe is indeed a moon of Saturn. I'm pretty confident about that because I've heard of it before, maybe in some sci-fi context or in school.

As for Helene, I'm trying to remember. I think Helene is a moon of Saturn as well. I recall that some of Saturn's moons have names from Greek mythology, and both Phoebe and Helene fit that pattern. Phoebe was a Titan in Greek mythology, the daughter of Uranus and Gaia, if I'm not mistaken. Helene is also a figure from mythology, possibly the mother of Helen of Troy, but I'm not entirely sure. Regardless, the naming convention points towards Saturn.

Let me consider the other options to make sure I'm not missing something. Pluto is a dwarf planet, and I know it has moons like Charon, but I don't think Phoebe or Helene are among them. Neptune's moons are fewer, like Triton and Nereid, but I don't recall Phoebe or Helene being Neptune's moons. Mars has moons like Phobos and Deimos, but those are different names, so Phoebe and Helene aren't from Mars. Earth and the Sun don't have moons in the same sense; Earth has the Moon, but the Sun doesn't have any. Venus and Mercury also don't have moons. Jupiter has a lot of moons, like Io, Europa, and Ganymede, but I don't think Phoebe or Helene are among them. Uranus has several moons, but again, I'm pretty sure they're named differently, maybe like Titania or Oberon.

So putting it all together, the most likely planet is Saturn. I'm pretty confident because Saturn is known for having many moons, including Dione, which I remember is one, and Phoebe and Helene fit the naming pattern of other Saturnian moons.

Phoebe Dione and Helene are moons of Saturn, known for its extensive system of natural satellites.
