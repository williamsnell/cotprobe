Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal coalition and why it was successful in the 1930s. I'm a bit rusty on my US history, but I'll try to piece this together.

The question asks for a significant reason behind the electoral success of the New Deal. The options are A to H, and I need to pick the right one. Let me go through each option and see which makes the most sense.

Starting with option A: A strong anti-war stance during World War II. Wait, the New Deal was during the 1930s, and WWII started in 1939. I think the New Deal was more about the Great Depression recovery, not so much about WWII policies. So A might not be the main reason for the New Deal's success.

Option B: A focus on mobilizing young voters. I'm not sure about this. The New Deal did create some programs that affected different groups, but I don't recall it being particularly focused on young voters. Maybe more on the working class and farmers?

Option C: A commitment to ending racial segregation. The New Deal did have some progressive elements, but I think the main focus was economic recovery. Ending segregation might have been a part of it, but was that a key factor in their electoral success? Maybe not the primary reason.

Option D: A major shift of African American voters from the Republican to the Democratic Party. Hmm, I remember that African Americans had been predominantly Republican since the Civil War, supporting Lincoln and the GOP because of their abolitionist roots. But during the New Deal, FDR and the Democrats introduced policies that benefited many, including African Americans through programs like the WPA and the TVA. This might have started shifting their loyalty towards the Democrats. So D sounds plausible.

Option E: The endorsement of prominent business leaders. Wait, the New Deal had some conflicts with business leaders, like the Supreme Court challenges and the business community opposing some aspects, especially the National Recovery Administration. So E doesn't seem right because business leaders weren't endorsing the New Deal; in fact, many were against it.

Option F: A focus on a bipartisan approach to major social and economic legislation. The New Deal was a series of programs, laws, and reforms, but I think it was more of a Democratic initiative rather than bipartisan. The Republicans were often in opposition, especially during the 1930s when they were the minority. So F might not be correct.

Option G: The creation of a strong alliance with the Republican Party. This seems unlikely because the New Deal was a Democratic platform, and the Republicans were generally opposed to it. So G is probably not the reason.

Option H: A focus on reducing government intervention in the economy. No, that's the opposite of the New Deal. The New Deal was all about increasing government intervention through various programs to stimulate the economy and provide relief. So H is definitely wrong.

Putting it all together, the main reasons for the New Deal's success were its programs that helped the average American, especially the working class, farmers, and the unemployed. These programs built a coalition that included various groups. One significant shift was the support from African Americans, who started moving from the Republican to the Democratic Party. This shift was crucial because it added a new base of support for the Democrats, which helped sustain the New Deal coalition.

So the correct answer should be D: A major shift of African American voters from the Republican to the Democratic Party.

The New Deal's success was due to its effective programs that addressed the Great Depression, which garnered support from various groups, including African Americans who shifted their loyalty from the Republican to the Democratic Party. This shift was a key factor in building the New Deal coalition.

Answer: D
