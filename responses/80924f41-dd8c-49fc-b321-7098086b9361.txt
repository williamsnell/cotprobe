Okay, I need to find the convolution of f(t) and g(t), where f(t) is t and g(t) is t squared. Hmm, convolution. I remember that convolution involves integrating the product of one function and a reversed version of the other. So the formula is f(t) * g(t) = integral from negative infinity to positive infinity of f(τ)g(t - τ) dτ. But wait, since both functions are polynomials and causal (they're zero for negative t), maybe I can simplify the limits.

Let me write down the functions: f(τ) = τ when τ is positive, else zero. Similarly, g(t - τ) is (t - τ)^2 when t - τ is positive, so τ < t. So the integral becomes from τ=0 to τ=t. So the convolution integral is the integral from 0 to t of τ multiplied by (t - τ)^2 dτ.

Expanding (t - τ)^2 gives t² - 2tτ + τ². Now multiply by τ: τ(t² - 2tτ + τ²) = τt² - 2tτ² + τ³.

So the integral becomes the sum of three integrals:
1. ∫ τt² dτ from 0 to t,
2. ∫ (-2tτ²) dτ from 0 to t,
3. ∫ τ³ dτ from 0 to t.

Let me compute each part separately.

First integral: t² ∫ τ dτ from 0 to t. The integral of τ is (τ²)/2. Evaluated from 0 to t gives (t²)/2. Multiply by t²: t²*(t²/2) = t^4/2.

Second integral: -2t ∫ τ² dτ from 0 to t. The integral of τ² is τ³/3. So it's -2t*(t^3/3 - 0) = -2t*(t^3/3) = -2t^4/3.

Third integral: ∫ τ³ dτ from 0 to t. Integral of τ³ is τ^4/4. Evaluated gives (t^4)/4.

Now add them all together:
t^4/2 - 2t^4/3 + t^4/4.

To add these fractions, find a common denominator, which is 12.

t^4/2 = 6t^4/12,
-2t^4/3 = -8t^4/12,
t^4/4 = 3t^4/12.

Adding these: (6 -8 +3) t^4/12 = (1) t^4/12.

Wait, that gives t^4/12. But looking at the options, that's option B. But I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be something else. Did I make a mistake in the integration?

Let me double-check each step. Expanding τ*(t - τ)^2: correct expansion. Integration limits from 0 to t: correct. Each integral computation: first part t^4/2, second -2t^4/3, third t^4/4. Sum is correct: 6/12 -8/12 +3/12 = 1/12. So the result is t^4/12, which is option B. But wait, I'm not sure if I did the convolution correctly. Alternatively, maybe I should use Laplace transforms because convolution in time domain is multiplication in Laplace domain. Let me try that method to verify.

The Laplace transform of f(t)=t is F(s) = 1/s². The Laplace transform of g(t)=t² is G(s) = 2/s³. The convolution would be the inverse Laplace transform of F(s)G(s) = (1/s²)(2/s³) = 2/s^5. The inverse Laplace of 2/s^5 is (2/4! ) t^4 = (2/24) t^4 = t^4/12. So that confirms it. Therefore, the correct answer is B: t^4/12.

The convolution of \( f(t) = t \) and \( g(t) = t^2 \) is computed using the integral \( (f * g)(t) = \int_0^t \tau (t - \tau)^2 d\tau \). Expanding and integrating term by term gives \( \frac{t^4}{12} \). Using Laplace transforms confirms this result. 

Answer: B
