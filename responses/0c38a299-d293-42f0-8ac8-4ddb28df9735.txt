Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The couple is coming for preconceptional genetic counseling because both have a family history of α-thalassemia. The woman has a minimally decreased hemoglobin concentration, and genetic studies show a single gene deletion. The man, on the other hand, has microcytic anemia and a two-gene deletion. Importantly, the two-gene deletion is in trans, meaning one deletion is on the maternal gene and the other on the paternal gene. The question is asking what percentage of their offspring will have a two-gene deletion.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I should recall what α-thalassemia is. Thalassemia is a group of disorders where the body doesn't produce enough hemoglobin. α-thalassemia specifically affects the α-globin genes. Humans have two alpha-globin genes on each chromosome 16; so, each person has four in total. Deletions of these genes can lead to different severities of the condition.

In this case, the woman has a single gene deletion. So she probably is a carrier. Let's think about her genotype. Since she has a single deletion and a minimally decreased hemoglobin, she's likely heterozygous for the deletion. So her genotype would be something like αα/α- (assuming the deletion is represented by a minus sign). Wait, no, more accurately, each chromosome has two alpha genes. So if she has a deletion of one gene on one chromosome, her genotype would be α- on one chromosome and αα on the other. So her genotype is αα/α-.

The man has a two-gene deletion. But it's in trans, which means the two deletions are on opposite chromosomes. So each chromosome (maternal and paternal) has one deletion. So his genotype would be α- on each chromosome, but each deletion is on a different chromosome. Wait, no. Wait, a two-gene deletion in trans would mean each of his two chromosomes has a deletion. So each chromosome has one deleted gene. So his genotype would be α- on both chromosomes, but each deletion is on a separate chromosome. So his genotype is α-α-, but in a trans configuration. Alternatively, since each chromosome has one deletion, it's like each has one working alpha gene and one deleted. So his genotype is α- on both chromosomes. Wait, no, wait. Wait, each chromosome has two alpha genes. If you have a two-gene deletion, that's two genes missing. If it's in trans, each of the two chromosomes has a deletion of one gene. So each chromosome has one gene left. So his genotype would be α- on each chromosome (i.e., each has one deletion). So he is probably more severely affected, hence the microcytic anemia.

Wait, no, wait a second. Let me think again. The man has a two-gene deletion, and it's in trans. So for each of his two chromosomes (maternal and paternal), he has one deletion. So each chromosome has one alpha gene deleted. So each chromosome has one working alpha gene. Since each normal alpha gene is on each chromosome, each chromosome contributes one alpha gene. So his genotype would be α0 (meaning one deletion) from each parent, but in trans, meaning each chromosome has a deletion. So his genotype is α- from each parent. So he's α- on both chromosomes.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. In α-thalassemia, each person has four alpha genes (two on each chromosome 16). Deletions can be of one or two genes. The man has a two-gene deletion in trans, which means that each of his two chromosomes has a deletion of one gene. So each chromosome has one normal alpha gene and one deleted (α-). So his genotype would be α- on both chromosomes, but each from a different parent. So for each chromosome, he has one α gene and one deleted. So the man's genotype is α- on both chromosomes, but each deletion is on a different chromosome.

Wait, but actually, each chromosome has two alpha genes. So a two-gene deletion in trans would mean that each chromosome has one deletion. So the man has two deletions, one on each chromosome, each from a different parent. So his genotype would be α- on each chromosome. So each chromosome has one alpha gene and one deleted. So he has two alpha genes total but on different chromosomes.

Now, the woman has a single gene deletion. So she has one alpha gene deleted, so her genotype is probably αα on one chromosome and α- on the other. Wait, no, each chromosome has two alpha genes. So if she has a single gene deletion, she's missing one gene on one chromosome. So her genotype would be αα/α-; but wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think. Each chromosome has two alpha genes. If she has a single gene deletion, she's missing one gene on one chromosome, so her genotype is αα on one chromosome and α- on the other. So each of her gametes would have either a normal gene or a deleted gene.

Wait, no, wait. Let me model this more accurately. The woman's genotype: she has a single gene deletion, so one of her two chromosomes (on chromosome 16) has one alpha gene deleted. So she is heterozygous for the deletion. So her genotype is αα for one chromosome and α- for the other. Wait, no: each chromosome has two alpha genes. So if she has a single deletion, she has one normal alpha gene on one chromosome and one deleted on the same chromosome. So for example, one chromosome has αα and the other has αα. But she has a single deletion, so perhaps one chromosome is αα and the other is α- (but wait, each chromosome has two genes, so the other chromosome would have both genes intact). Wait, no, that's not possible because each chromosome has two alpha genes. So if she has a single gene deleted, that's one of the two on one chromosome. So her genotype is αα on one chromosome (both genes present) and α- on the other (one gene deleted). So her genotype is αα/α-.

Wait, no, that can't be right because each chromosome has two alpha genes. So if she has a single gene deletion, one chromosome has both genes (αα), and the other has one gene (α-) because one is deleted. So her genotype is αα/α-.

The man, as I thought earlier, has a two-gene deletion in trans, so each of his two chromosomes has one deletion. So each chromosome has one normal and one deleted. So his genotype is α- on both chromosomes, but each deletion is on a different chromosome. So each of his chromosomes has one alpha gene and one deleted. So when he produces gametes, each gamete will have one alpha gene (since each of his chromosomes has one alpha and one deleted, but the gamete gets one chromosome, which has one alpha gene).

Wait, no. Let me think about gamete formation. For each parent, when they produce gametes, each gamete gets one of each chromosome. So the woman has two chromosomes: one is αα (both genes) and the other is α- (one gene missing). So when she makes gametes, she can produce two types: one that gets the αα chromosome (which contributes both alpha genes) and one that gets the α- chromosome (which contributes one alpha gene). Wait, no. Wait, each gamete gets one of the two chromosomes. So each gamete from the woman is either from the αα chromosome (so two alpha genes) or from the α- chromosome (only one alpha gene).

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because each gamete should get one chromosome, which has two alpha genes if it's the normal one, or one gene if it's the deleted one. So the woman's gametes would be either (from αα chromosome) two alpha genes, or (from α- chromosome) one alpha gene. So 50% chance of each gamete type.

The man has two chromosomes, each with one alpha gene and one deleted. So each chromosome has one alpha gene. So when he produces gametes, each gamete gets one chromosome, which has one alpha gene. So all his gametes have one alpha gene.

Wait, no. Wait, the man's genotype is α- on both chromosomes. Each chromosome has one alpha gene and one deleted. So when he makes gametes, each gamete gets one of his two chromosomes. Each chromosome has one alpha gene (because one is deleted). So all his gametes have one alpha gene. So all his gametes are α-.

Wait, but wait, each chromosome has two alpha genes. If each of his chromosomes has one deletion, then each has one alpha gene. So each gamete from him would have one alpha gene (since each chromosome contributes one alpha gene).

So now, let's model the possible offspring.

The woman's gametes: 50% chance of αα (both genes) and 50% chance of α- (one gene).

Wait, no. Wait, the woman's genotype is αα/α-. So each gamete from her is either the αα chromosome (so two alpha genes) or the α- chromosome (one alpha gene). So 50% chance of αα (which contributes two alpha genes), and 50% chance of α- (which contributes one alpha gene).

The man's gametes: each has one alpha gene, because each of his chromosomes has one alpha gene. So all his gametes are α- (since each has one alpha gene and one deleted). Wait, no. Wait, each gamete from the man has one alpha gene because each chromosome has one alpha gene. So each gamete from him is α- (since each has one alpha gene and one deleted). Wait, no, the gamete only has one chromosome, which has one alpha gene. So each gamete has one alpha gene.

Wait, but in reality, each gamete gets one of the two chromosomes. Each chromosome has one alpha gene. So all his gametes have one alpha gene.

So when combining the woman's and man's gametes, the possible offspring genotypes are:

1. Woman's αα (two alpha genes) + man's α- (one alpha gene): So the offspring would have three alpha genes (two from mother's αα chromosome, one from father's α- chromosome). Wait, no, because each parent contributes one chromosome. So the mother's αα chromosome contributes two alpha genes, and the father's α- chromosome contributes one alpha gene. So the total is three alpha genes.

Wait, no, each chromosome has two alpha genes, but if one is deleted, it only has one. So the mother's gamete is either αα (two genes) or α- (one gene). The father's gamete is α- (one gene).

So the possible combinations are:

- Mother's αα (two genes) + Father's α- (one gene): total of three alpha genes. So the child has three alpha genes.

- Mother's α- (one gene) + Father's α- (one gene): total of two alpha genes.

But wait, α-thalassemia is when you have fewer alpha genes. The number of alpha genes determines the severity. A person with three alpha genes (like in the first case) would have a mild condition, maybe like the woman, who has a minimally decreased hemoglobin. The second case, two alpha genes, would be more severe, but depends on the exact genotype.

But the question is about the percentage of offspring who have a two-gene deletion. Wait, no, the question is about the percentage who have a two-gene deletion. Wait, the man has a two-gene deletion, but in trans. So each of his chromosomes has one deletion. So the question is, what's the chance their child has a two-gene deletion.

Wait, but the child would inherit one chromosome from each parent. So let's think about the possible combinations.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

The woman's genotype: she has a single gene deletion, so her genotype is αα/α-. So she can contribute either an αα chromosome (two genes) or an α- chromosome (one gene) with 50% each.

The man's genotype: he has a two-gene deletion in trans, which means each of his two chromosomes has one deletion. So his genotype is α- on each chromosome. So each of his gametes is α- (one gene).

So the possible offspring genotypes are:

- From mother's αα (two genes) + father's α- (one gene): total alpha genes = 3.

- From mother's α- (one gene) + father's α- (one gene): total alpha genes = 2.

Wait, but the question is about the percentage of offspring who have a two-gene deletion. So a two-gene deletion would mean that the child has two missing genes. But in this scenario, the child can't have two deletions because the father only contributes one deletion. Wait, no, because the father has two deletions, one on each chromosome, but each gamete only gets one chromosome, which has one deletion. So the child can only inherit one deletion from the father and possibly one from the mother.

Wait, no, the mother only has one deletion on one chromosome. So if she contributes that chromosome, the child would have one deletion from her and one from the father. So total two deletions.

Wait, let's model this.

The woman can give either:

- Chromosome 1: αα (no deletion)

- Chromosome 2: α- (one deletion)

The man can give either:

- Chromosome A: α- (one deletion)

- Chromosome B: α- (one deletion)

Wait, no, the man has two chromosomes, each with one deletion. So each gamete from him will have one chromosome with one deletion (α-). So all his gametes are α-.

Wait, no, each gamete gets one of his two chromosomes, each of which has one deletion. So all his gametes are α- (each has one deletion).

So when the woman's gamete is αα (no deletion), the child gets αα (from mom) and α- (from dad), so total two alpha genes (from mom's two) and one from dad. Wait, no, wait. Each parent contributes one chromosome. So the mother's αα chromosome has two alpha genes, and the father's α- chromosome has one alpha gene. So the child has three alpha genes (2+1). So the child has three alpha genes, which is more than two, so no deletion beyond that.

If the mother contributes her α- chromosome (one alpha gene), and the father contributes his α- chromosome (one alpha gene), the child gets one alpha gene from each parent. So total two alpha genes. So the child has a two-gene deletion (since each parent contributed one deletion, but wait no, the child has two alpha genes, which is two, but the normal is four. So two missing. So the child has a two-gene deletion.

Wait, but let me think again. Each parent contributes one chromosome. The woman's α- chromosome has one alpha gene (because one is deleted), and the man's α- chromosome has one alpha gene. So the child would have two alpha genes in total. Since a normal child has four alpha genes (two from each parent), having two means two are missing. So the child has a two-gene deletion.

So the probability is based on the woman contributing her α- chromosome. Since she has a 50% chance of giving α- and 50% of giving αα.

So when she gives α- (50% chance), the child will have two alpha genes (from both parents), which is a two-gene deletion. So the probability is 50%.

Wait, but let me double-check. The man's gametes all have one deletion (since each gamete is α-). The woman can give either αα or α-.

So the possible combinations:

1. Woman gives αα (50%): child gets two alpha genes from mom and one from dad → total three.

2. Woman gives α- (50%): child gets one alpha gene from mom and one from dad → total two.

So in 50% of cases, the child has two alpha genes (two deletions), and in 50% they have three (one deletion). But wait, each parent contributes one chromosome. So the child's genotype would be:

- If mom gives αα (two genes) and dad gives α- (one gene), the child's genotype is αα from mom and α- from dad. So they have three alpha genes (since each chromosome contributes one, but the mom's has two). Wait, no, each child gets one chromosome from each parent, each with their own set of genes.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me model it as possible combinations:

Mother's gamete types: 50% αα (two genes), 50% α- (one gene).

Father's gamete types: 100% α- (one gene).

So the possible offspring:

- 50% (mom αα + dad α-) → child has αα (from mom) and α- (from dad). So the child has three alpha genes (two from mom, one from dad). So no two-gene deletion; only one gene missing.

- 50% (mom α- + dad α-) → child has α- (one gene) from mom and α- (one gene) from dad. So total two alpha genes. So two deletions; the child has two-gene deletion.

So the percentage of children with two-gene deletion is 50%.

Wait, but the options include 50% as option B. So the answer would be B:50%.

Wait, but let me think again. The man has a two-gene deletion in trans, meaning each of his chromosomes has one deletion. So when he produces gametes, each gamete has one deletion. So all his gametes are α-.

The woman has a single deletion on one chromosome, so 50% chance to give α- (one gene) and 50% to give αα (two genes).

So when the woman gives αα (two genes), the child gets two from mom and one from dad → three genes. Not a two-gene deletion.

When the woman gives α- (one gene), the child gets one from mom and one from dad → two genes. So two deletions.

Thus, 50% of the children will have two deletions.
</think>

The couple consists of a woman with a single α-globin gene deletion (genotype: αα/α-) and a man with a two-gene deletion in trans (genotype: α-/α-). The woman's gametes are 50% αα (two genes) and 50% α- (one gene). The man's gametes are all α- (one gene, as each chromosome has one deletion). 

The possible offspring genotypes are:

1. **Mother's αα + Father's α-**: The child inherits two α genes from the mother and one from the father, totaling three α genes. This results in a single gene deletion, not a two-gene deletion.
   
2. **Mother's α- + Father's α-**: The child inherits one α gene from the mother and one from the father, totaling two α genes. This results in a two-gene deletion.

Since the woman has a 50% chance of contributing her α- chromosome, 50% of the offspring will have a two-gene deletion.

**Answer: B: 50%**
