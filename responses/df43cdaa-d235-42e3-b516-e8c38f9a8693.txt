Options:

A: it posits that all sex is rape.
B: by suggesting that the harm of rape is that it is nonconsensual, it implies that all consensual sex is good.
C: by suggesting that the harm of rape has nothing to do with the victim's gender, it implies that women are not especially harmed by nonconsensual sex.

E: it implies that consensual sex is inherently harmful.
F: by suggesting that the harm of rape is only physical, it implies that emotional trauma in consensual sex is not harmful.
G: by suggesting that rape is only harmful in cases of physical injury, it implies that psychological harm in consensual sex is not important.
H: it suggests that the harm of rape is entirely dependent on the victim's personal perception, thereby downplaying the potential harms of consensual sex.
I: all of the above.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about West's arguments regarding feminist legal theory and consensual sex. Let me break this down step by step.

The question is asking why West thinks feminist legal theory has led to under-acknowledging the harms of consensual sex. The options are A through J, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I'll recall what I know about feminist legal theory, particularly from someone like Kimberl√© Crenshaw or other feminist scholars. Feminist legal theory often critiques traditional legal frameworks for ignoring the gendered aspects of harm. For example, they argue that rape isn't just about the lack of consent but also about the power dynamics and the systemic oppression of women.

Now, the question is about under-acknowledging the harms of consensual sex. So, West is saying that feminist theory has inadvertently made people think that consensual sex isn't harmful, which is a problem because there can be harms even in consensual relationships, like emotional trauma or inequality in power dynamics.

Looking at the options:

Option A: "it posits that all sex is rape." That seems too extreme. Feminist theory doesn't say that; it's more about recognizing that rape is about power, not just the absence of consent.

Option B: "by suggesting that the harm of rape is that it is nonconsensual, it implies that all consensual sex is good." This makes sense because if the main harm of rape is nonconsent, then consensual sex might be seen as without harm. But I think feminist theory is more nuanced than that, considering other harms beyond just consent.

Option C: "by suggesting that the harm of rape has nothing to do with the victim's gender, it implies that women are not especially harmed by nonconsensual sex." Wait, feminist theory does focus on gender. Rape is a gendered crime because it's often about exerting power over women. So this option seems opposite of what feminist theory actually says.

Option D: "it supports the idea that consent is the only factor determining the harm of sex." Yes, this is similar to B. If consent is the only factor, then consensual sex is automatically not harmful, ignoring other potential harms.

Option E: "it implies that consensual sex is inherently harmful." No, that's the opposite. Feminist theory isn't saying consensual sex is harmful; it's more about not ignoring the harms that can exist in consensual contexts.

Option F: "by suggesting that the harm of rape is only physical, it implies that emotional trauma in consensual sex is not harmful." This could be a point. If feminist theory focuses on physical harm in rape, maybe it downplays emotional harm elsewhere. But I'm not sure if this is the main argument West is making.

Option G: "by suggesting that rape is only harmful in cases of physical injury, it implies that psychological harm in consensual sex is not important." Similar to F, but more specific to psychological harm. Again, not sure if this is the main point.

Option H: "it suggests that the harm of rape is entirely dependent on the victim's personal perception, thereby downplaying the potential harms of consensual sex." This seems to focus on subjective perceptions, which might not be the main issue here.

Option I: "all of the above." If more than one option is correct, but I'm not sure if all apply.

Option J: "it argues that women are not capable of giving consent." That's incorrect; feminist theory supports consent and critiques situations where consent isn't freely given due to power imbalances.

So, looking back, the key seems to be that feminist theory's focus on consent as a factor in rape might lead people to think that as long as sex is consensual, it's not harmful. That's option B and D. But which one is more accurate?

West's argument is that feminist legal theory has made people think that if sex is consensual, it's not harmful. So, if the theory says the harm of rape is nonconsent, then consensual sex is seen as good. That's option B.

Alternatively, option D says it supports consent as the only factor, which also leads to the same conclusion. So both B and D are pointing to similar issues. But which is more precise?

I think option B is more precise because it's not just about consent being the only factor, but specifically that by defining the harm of rape as nonconsent, it implies that consensual sex is good. So B is the better answer.

West argues that feminist legal theory has inadvertently led to the under-acknowledgement of the harms of consensual sex because it suggests that the harm of rape is that it is nonconsensual, thereby implying that all consensual sex is good. This perspective downplays the potential for harm in consensual relationships, such as emotional trauma or power imbalances, which feminist theory itself often critiques. By focusing on consent as the primary factor, the theory may inadvertently suggest that consensual sex is inherently without harm, which is problematic.

Answer: B
