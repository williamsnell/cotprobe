Question:

Which of the following statements concerning the regression population and sample is FALSE?

Options:

A: The population is the total collection of all items of interest
B: The population can be infinite
C: In theory, the sample could be larger than the population
D: A random sample is one where each individual item from the population is equally likely to be drawn.

Answer:

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which statement about regression population and sample is false. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A says the population is the total collection of all items of interest. That sounds right because in statistics, the population refers to the entire set you're studying. So A is probably true.

Option B states that the population can be infinite. Hmm, I remember that populations can indeed be very large, even infinite. For example, if we're talking about all possible measurements of a continuous process, the population could be infinite. So B is true.

Option C claims that in theory, the sample could be larger than the population. Wait, that doesn't make sense. A sample is a subset of the population. If the population is finite, how can the sample be larger? It's impossible because the sample is taken from the population. So C must be false.

Option D says a random sample is one where each individual has an equal chance of being drawn. Yes, that's correct. Random sampling ensures each member has the same probability, so D is true.

So the false statement is C because a sample can't be larger than the population it's drawn from.

The false statement is C because a sample cannot be larger than the population it's drawn from.

Answer: C
