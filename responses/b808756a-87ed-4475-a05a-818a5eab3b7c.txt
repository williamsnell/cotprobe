Okay, so I've got this question here about individual freedom to schedule work and what it's an example of. The options are from A to J, each being a different job-related term. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It's asking about individual freedom to schedule work, so it's related to how people manage their own work hours or tasks. That makes me think about concepts related to work organization, flexibility, and job-related terms.

Looking at the options, I see terms like job design, job planning, job specification, etc. I'll go through each one to see which fits best.

Option A: Job design. Job design refers to how tasks are structured within a job. It can include things like the division of tasks, responsibilities, and how work is organized. If someone has the freedom to schedule their work, that might be part of how the job is designed. So this could be a possible answer.

Option B: Job planning. Job planning is more about the process of organizing and scheduling work activities. It involves setting goals and timelines. So if an individual is planning their own work schedule, this might fall under job planning.

Option C: Job specification. This is about the detailed description of a job, including tasks, duties, and responsibilities. It's more about the specifics of what the job entails rather than the scheduling aspect.

Option D: Job satisfaction. This relates to how content an employee is with their job. While having freedom might affect satisfaction, the question is about the example itself, not the outcome.

Option E: Job rate. I'm not sure about this one. It might refer to the rate at which jobs are processed or the pay rate, but it doesn't seem related to scheduling freedom.

Option F: Job security. This is about the stability of employment. It doesn't directly relate to scheduling freedom.

Option G: Job enrichment. This involves enhancing the job to make it more fulfilling, often by adding more responsibilities or variety. It's more about the content of the job rather than scheduling.

Option H: Job analysis. This is the process of determining what a job entails, like tasks, skills needed, etc. Not directly related to scheduling freedom.

Option I: Job evaluation. This is about determining the value of a job relative to others in the organization. It's more about compensation and structure, not scheduling.

Option J: Job rotation. This is when employees move through different jobs to gain experience. Again, not directly related to scheduling freedom.

Now, trying to decide between A, B, and maybe others. Job design (A) is about structuring the job, which could include allowing freedom in scheduling. Job planning (B) is about organizing work activities, which would directly involve scheduling.

Wait, the question is about individual freedom to schedule work. So it's not just about how the job is designed but more about the ability to plan when to work. So job planning (B) seems more specific to the act of scheduling. Job design might influence whether such freedom exists, but the example itself is about the action of scheduling, which is planning.

So I think the answer is B: Job planning.

The individual freedom to schedule work is best described as an example of job planning, as it involves organizing and managing work activities, including the timing and structure of tasks.

Answer: B
