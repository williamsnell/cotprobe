Okay, so I've got this problem here where x and y are positive integers, and it's given that 3x + 7y is divisible by 11. I need to figure out which of the options from A to J must also be divisible by 11. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that if a number is divisible by 11, then it's congruent to 0 modulo 11. So, 3x + 7y ≡ 0 mod 11. That's our starting point.

I think I can express this congruence as 3x ≡ -7y mod 11. But wait, working with negative numbers can be a bit tricky, so maybe I should find a positive equivalent. Since -7 mod 11 is the same as 4 (because 11 - 7 = 4), I can rewrite this as 3x ≡ 4y mod 11. 

Now, I might want to solve for x in terms of y or vice versa. Let me try solving for x. To isolate x, I need to multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 3 mod 11. The inverse of 3 modulo 11 is a number which when multiplied by 3 gives 1 mod 11. Let me think, 3*4=12≡1 mod11, so the inverse is 4.

Multiplying both sides by 4 gives: x ≡ 4*4y mod11 → x ≡ 16y mod11. But 16 mod11 is 5, so x ≡5y mod11. So x is congruent to 5y modulo11. That means x = 5y + 11k for some integer k.

Now, I can substitute x in each of the options and see if the expression simplifies to something divisible by 11.

Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: 7x + 3y
Substituting x=5y+11k:
7*(5y +11k) +3y = 35y +77k +3y =38y +77k
38 mod11 is 38-33=5, and 77 is 7*11, so 77k is 0 mod11. So 38y +77k ≡5y mod11. But from earlier, 3x +7y ≡0 mod11, which implies y ≡ (-3x)/7 mod11. Wait, maybe I should check if 5y is necessarily 0 mod11. Since y could be any integer, 5y might not be 0 unless y is a multiple of 11. So 5y mod11 isn't necessarily 0, so option A isn't necessarily divisible by11.

Option B: x + y +5
Substituting x=5y+11k:
(5y+11k)+y +5 =6y +11k +5. 6y mod11 is 6y, and 5 is just 5. So overall, 6y +5. Unless 6y +5 is 0 mod11, but that depends on y. For example, if y=1, then 6+5=11, which is 0. But if y=2, 12+5=17≡6 mod11, which isn't 0. So B isn't necessarily divisible by11.

Option C:6x -2y
Substituting x=5y+11k:
6*(5y +11k) -2y =30y +66k -2y =28y +66k. 28 mod11 is 6 (since 22 is 2*11, 28-22=6), and 66k is 0 mod11. So 28y ≡6y mod11. From earlier, x ≡5y mod11, so 3x +7y ≡0 → 3*(5y)+7y=15y+7y=22y≡0 mod11. 22y is always 0 mod11, so that's consistent. Now, 6y mod11: does 6y have to be 0? Let's see. From 22y ≡0, which implies y ≡0 mod (11/ gcd(22,11))=0 mod1. So any y, but 6y mod11 could be anything. For example, if y=1, 6*1=6 mod11≠0. So 6y isn't necessarily 0, so option C isn't necessarily divisible by11.

Option D:8x +3y
Substituting x=5y+11k:
8*(5y +11k) +3y=40y +88k +3y=43y +88k. 43 mod11: 11*3=33, 43-33=10, so 43y≡10y mod11. 88k is 0. So total is 10y. But from earlier, 22y≡0 mod11, which implies y≡0 mod11/ gcd(22,11)=0 mod1, which is always true, but 10y≡0 mod11 only if y is a multiple of 11. But y doesn't have to be a multiple of 11; it just has to satisfy that 3x +7y is 0 mod11, which we've expressed as x≡5y mod11. So y could be 1, making 10y=10, which isn't 0 mod11. So D isn't necessarily divisible by11.

Option E:4x +6y
Substituting x=5y+11k:
4*(5y +11k) +6y=20y +44k +6y=26y +44k. 26 mod11 is 4 (since 22 is 2*11, 26-22=4), and 44k is 0. So 26y≡4y mod11. Now, from 3x +7y ≡0, we have x≡5y mod11. Let's compute 4y mod11. Is this necessarily 0? Let's see. Suppose y=1: 4*1=4≠0. So E isn't necessarily divisible by11.

Option F:5x +6y
Substituting x=5y+11k:
5*(5y +11k) +6y=25y +55k +6y=31y +55k. 31 mod11 is 9 (since 11*2=22, 31-22=9), and 55k is 0. So 31y≡9y mod11. From earlier, 22y≡0 mod11, which implies y can be any integer, but 9y isn't necessarily 0. For y=1, 9≠0. So F isn't necessarily divisible by11.

Option G:9x +4y
Substituting x=5y+11k:
9*(5y +11k) +4y=45y +99k +4y=49y +99k. 49 mod11: 11*4=44, 49-44=5, so 49y≡5y mod11. 99k is 0. So total is 5y. But from 3x +7y≡0, which we have as x≡5y mod11. Let's see if 5y must be 0 mod11. If x=5y mod11, then 3*(5y) +7y ≡15y +7y=22y≡0 mod11. So 22y≡0 → y≡0 mod (11/gcd(22,11)) → y≡0 mod1, which is always true, but doesn't force y to be 0 mod11. So 5y could be non-zero. For example, y=1 →5≠0. So G isn't necessarily divisible by11.

Option H:4x -9y
Substituting x=5y+11k:
4*(5y +11k) -9y=20y +44k -9y=11y +44k. 11y is 0 mod11, and 44k is 0 mod11. So total is 0 +0=0 mod11. Oh! So H simplifies to 0 mod11. That means 4x -9y is divisible by11 whenever 3x +7y is. So H is a candidate.

But just to be thorough, let me check the other options.

Option I:2x +5y
Substituting x=5y+11k:
2*(5y +11k) +5y=10y +22k +5y=15y +22k. 15 mod11 is 4, and 22k is 0. So 4y mod11. As before, unless y is a multiple of 11, 4y isn't 0. So I isn't necessarily divisible by11.

Option J:x +8y
Substituting x=5y+11k:
(5y +11k) +8y=13y +11k. 13 mod11 is 2, so 2y +0. So 2y mod11. Unless y is a multiple of 11, 2y isn't 0. For y=1, 2≠0. So J isn't necessarily divisible by11.

Wait, but I thought H worked. Let me double-check the substitution for H:

H: 4x -9y
x=5y +11k → 4*(5y +11k) -9y =20y +44k -9y=11y +44k. Both terms are multiples of 11, so yes, H is divisible by11.

So the correct answer must be H.
</think>

The problem states that 3x + 7y is divisible by 11, which implies 3x + 7y ≡ 0 mod 11. Rearranging, we find x ≡ 5y mod 11. Substituting x = 5y + 11k into each option, we check for divisibility by 11. 

For option H: 4x - 9y, substituting x gives 4*(5y + 11k) - 9y = 20y + 44k - 9y = 11y + 44k. Since both terms are multiples of 11, 4x - 9y is divisible by 11. 

Thus, the correct answer is H.
