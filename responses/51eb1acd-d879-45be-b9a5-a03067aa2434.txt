Okay, so I have this question about contract law, specifically dealing with debt and agreements between a creditor and a debtor. Hmm, let me try to break it down. 

The scenario is that a creditor loaned his friend $15,000 for college tuition. Six months later, the friend lost his job and can't repay. Then the creditor sends a letter on June 1 offering to discharge the $15,000 debt if the friend delivers an autographed baseball bat by August 1. The friend calls and accepts the offer. The question is about the effect of this verbal acceptance.

I remember that in contract law, an agreement between a creditor and debtor where the creditor accepts something in satisfaction of the debt is called an accord and satisfaction. But wait, what exactly is an accord and satisfaction? It's when the parties agree to settle the debt with something other than what was originally agreed upon. So here, the creditor is agreeing to accept the baseball bat instead of the $15,000.

Looking at the options, option C is "an accord and satisfaction." That seems to fit because they're agreeing to a new arrangement to settle the debt. 

Another option I should consider is a substituted compromise agreement, which is option A. A substituted compromise is when a new agreement replaces the old one, typically involving a payment or performance that's different from what was originally owed. That sounds similar to an accord and satisfaction. How do I tell them apart?

Wait, I think an accord and satisfaction involves the creditor accepting a different performance, while a substituted compromise might involve a different agreement that modifies the original terms, perhaps without the exchange of something else. Or maybe they're similar. I'm a bit confused here.

Also, option F is a bilateral executory accord. A bilateral agreement means both parties are making a promise. Here, the creditor promises to discharge the debt, and the debtor promises to deliver the bat. So it's a mutual promise, making it bilateral. But does that make it an accord and satisfaction or a bilateral executory accord?

An executory accord implies that both parties are to perform. So in this case, the creditor is executing by not demanding the debt, and the debtor is executing by giving the bat. So it's a bilateral executory accord, which would be option F. But I thought the main term was accord and satisfaction.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think again. Accord and satisfaction is a specific term in contract law where the parties agree to a new performance to settle a debt. It's a way to discharge the original obligation. So in this case, the creditor is accepting the bat in satisfaction of the debt. So that's an accord and satisfaction, which is option C.

Substituted compromise agreement (option A) might be when the original agreement is modified, but I think that's more about changing the terms rather than substituting the performance entirely. So here, the original debt was $15k, now it's replaced with the bat. So it's more of an accord and satisfaction.

Bilateral executory accord (option F) sounds correct because both are promising to do something. But I think F is more about the type of contract, while C is the specific doctrine. So the main effect is an accord and satisfaction, making option C correct.

Other options: D is novation, which would require a new agreement with a third party, which isn't the case here. E is mortgage agreement, which isn't relevant here. G is mutual satisfaction, which is vague. H is unenforceable, but the friend accepted, so it's enforceable. I is creditor-debtor agreement, which is a general term, not specific enough. J is unilateral, but it's mutual, so J is out.

So I think the answer is C: an accord and satisfaction.

The scenario involves a creditor offering to discharge a $15,000 debt in exchange for an autographed baseball bat, which the debtor accepts verbally. This situation fits the legal doctrine of **accord and satisfaction**, where the parties agree to settle the debt through a new performance. 

While a **bilateral executory accord** (option F) describes the mutual promises made by both parties, the specific term **accord and satisfaction** accurately captures the legal effect of substituting the original debt with a new performance. Other options, such as substituted compromise agreement (A), are less precise in this context. 

Thus, the correct answer is:

C: an accord and satisfaction.
