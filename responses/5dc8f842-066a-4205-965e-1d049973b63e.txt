Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this question about finding the 9's and 10's complements of some decimal numbers. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that the 9's complement is used in subtraction in computing, right? The 10's complement is just the 9's complement plus 1. So, for each number, I need to find both.

Let's start with part (a): 13579. To find the 9's complement, I subtract each digit from 9. So:

1 → 9-1=8
3 → 9-3=6
5 → 9-5=4
7 → 9-7=2
9 → 9-9=0

Putting that together, the 9's complement is 86420. Then, the 10's complement would be that plus 1, so 86421. Wait, but looking at the options, I need to check which option has this.

Now part (b): 90090. Let's do the 9's complement again. Each digit:

9 → 0
0 →9
0 →9
9 →0
0 →9

Wait, wait, no. Wait, wait, the number is 90090, which is 5 digits. So each digit:

9 →0
0 →9
0 →9
9 →0
0 →9

So the 9's complement is 0 9 9 0 9, which is 09909. Then the 10's complement is 09910. Hmm, looking for that in the options.

Part (c): 09900. Let's see, 9's complement. Each digit:

0 →9
9 →0
9 →0
0 →9
0 →9

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the number is 09900, so 5 digits.

0 →9
9 →0
9 →0
0 →9
0 →9

So the 9's complement is 90099. Then the 10's complement is 90100.

Wait, but let me double-check. Wait, 09900 as a 5-digit number. So each digit:

First digit is 0 →9
Second is 9 →0
Third is 9 →0
Fourth is 0 →9
Fifth is 0 →9

So 9 0 0 9 9 →90099. Then +1 is 90100.

Part (d): 10000. 9's complement: each digit:

1 →8
0 →9
0 →9
0 →9
0 →9

So 89999. 10's complement is 90000.

Part (e): 0000. 9's complement: 9999. 10's complement: 10000.

Now looking at the options, let's check each one.

Option A: For 13579, 86410 and 86411. No, I got 86420 and 86421. So A is wrong.

Option B: 13579's 9's is 86419? No, I got 86420. So B is wrong.

Option C: 86423 and 86424. No, my answer is 86420 and 86421. So C is out.

Option D: 86422 and 86423. Nope, same issue. D isn't right.

Option E: 86430 and 86431. No, that's way off. E is wrong.

Option F: 86421 and 86422. Wait, F says 13579's 9's is 86421. Hmm, but I thought 9's is 86420. Wait, maybe I made a mistake? Let me recalculate 13579's 9's complement.

1 →9-1=8
3→6
5→4
7→2
9→0

So 86420. So F's 9's is 86421, which is off by one. So F is wrong.

Option G: 86321 and 86322. No, that's way lower. G is wrong.

Option H: 13579's 9's is 86411. No, I have 86420. H is wrong.

Option I: 13579's 9's is 99999. That can't be right. I is off.

Option J: 13579's 9's is 86420 and 10's is 86421. Wait, J says 9's is 86420 and 10's is 86421. That matches what I have for (a).

Let me check the other numbers in J.

For 90090, J says 9's is 09909 and 10's is 09910. That's correct as per my calculation.

For 09900, J says 9's is 90099 and 10's is 90100. Correct.

For 10000, J says 9's is 90000? Wait, no. Wait, I thought 10000's 9's complement is 89999, and 10's is 90000. But in J, it says 90000 and 89999. Wait, that's reversed. Because 9's complement is 89999, and 10's is 90000. So J says 9's is 90000, which is wrong. So J is incorrect.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Looking at option F:

F says for 10000: 90000 and 89999. Wait, that's the opposite. 9's is 89999 and 10's is 90000. So F is wrong.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate 10000's 9's complement.

10000 is a 5-digit number. Each digit:

1 →8
0 →9
0 →9
0 →9
0 →9

So 8 9 9 9 9 →89999. 10's complement is 89999 +1=90000.

So in option J, for 10000, J says 90000 and 89999. That's reversed. So J is wrong.

Wait, but looking back at the options, let me check each again.

Option F: 10000's 9's is 90000, which is wrong. So F is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I missed another option. Let me check option F again.

Option F says for 13579: 86420 and 86421. Because 9's complement is 86420, 10's is 86421. That's correct. Then for 90090: 09909 and 09910. Correct. For 09900: 90099 and 90100. Correct. For 10000: 90000 and 89999. Wait, that's wrong because 9's is 89999, 10's is 90000. So F has 9's as 90000, which is incorrect.

Wait, but looking at option F: 10000's 9's is 90000, which would mean the 9's complement is 90000, but that's not possible because 10000's 9's complement should be 89999.

So perhaps none of the options are correct. Wait, but I must have made a mistake because the options must have one correct.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated 13579. Let me do that again.

13579: 5 digits.

Each digit subtracted from 9:

1 →8
3 →6
5 →4
7 →2
9 →0

So 86420. 10's complement is 86421.

Looking at option F, 13579's 9's is 86420, 10's is 86421. That's correct.

Now, let's check 90090 in option F: 09909 and 09910. Correct.

09900 in F: 90099 and 90100. Correct.

10000 in F: 90000 and 89999. Wait, that's incorrect because 9's should be 89999, 10's is 90000. So F has 90000 as 9's, which is wrong.

Wait, but perhaps the 10's complement is written as 90000, and 9's as 89999. So in option F, 10000's 9's is 90000, which is wrong. So F is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the 9's complement of 10000. Let me think again. 10000 is a 5-digit number. So:

1 →9-1=8
0 →9-0=9
0 →9
0 →9
0 →9

So 89999. 10's is 90000. So in the options, for 10000, the correct 9's is 89999 and 10's is 90000.

Looking at option F, it says 10000's 9's is 90000, which is wrong. So F is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check all options again.

Looking at option F:

(a) 13579: 86420 and 86421. Correct.

(b) 90090: 09909 and 09910. Correct.

(c) 09900: 90099 and 90100. Correct.

(d) 10000: 90000 and 89999. Wait, that's reversed. So 9's is 89999, 10's is 90000. So F has the 10's as 89999, which is wrong.

So F is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in 09900's 9's complement. Let me recalculate that.

09900 is 5 digits:

0 →9
9 →0
9 →0
0 →9
0 →9

So 9 0 0 9 9 →90099. 10's is 90100. So in option F, that's correct.

Wait, but 10000's 9's is 89999, so in the options, which one has that?

Looking at option J: 10000's 9's is 90000, which is wrong.

Option F: 90000 and 89999. So the 10's is 89999, which is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing an option where 10000's 9's is 89999 and 10's is 90000.

Looking at the options, I don't see any that have that except perhaps none. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the options.

Wait, looking back at the options, let me check option F again.

Option F says:

(d) 10000: 90000 and 89999.

That's wrong because 9's should be 89999 and 10's is 90000.

Hmm, maybe I should look for another option where all the other numbers are correct except this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in 0000's 9's and 10's complements.

0000's 9's complement is 9999, 10's is 10000.

Looking at option F, 0000's 9's is 9999 and 10's is 10000. So F has that correct.

Wait, but in F, the 10000's 9's is 90000, which is wrong. So perhaps F is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I should check if any other option has most correct except for one part.

Looking at option F, it's correct except for 10000's 9's.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating 10000's 9's complement. Let me think again.

Wait, 10000 is 5 digits: 1 followed by four 0s.

Each digit:

1 →8
0 →9
0 →9
0 →9
0 →9

So 8 followed by four 9s: 89999. So 9's complement is 89999, 10's is 90000.

Looking at the options, which one has that?

Option F says for 10000: 90000 and 89999. That's reversed.

Option H says for 10000: 89999 and 90000. Wait, looking at option H:

H: ... of 10000 are 89999 and 90000 ... Yes! So H has 10000's 9's as 89999 and 10's as 90000.

Wait, but let me check the rest of H.

H says:

(a) 13579: 86411 and 86412. Wait, I have 86420 and 86421. So H is wrong for (a).

So perhaps H is not the right option.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back.

The correct 9's and 10's complements for each number:

(a) 13579: 9's is 86420, 10's 86421.

(b) 90090: 09909, 09910.

(c) 09900:90099,90100.

(d)10000:89999,90000.

(e)0000:9999,10000.

Now, looking for an option that matches all of these.

Looking at option F:

(a) 86420,86421 → correct.

(b) 09909,09910 → correct.

(c)90099,90100 → correct.

(d)90000,89999 → wrong.

(e)9999,10000 → correct.

So F is correct except for (d).

Looking at option J:

(a)86420,86421 → correct.

(b)09909,09910 → correct.

(c)90099,90100 → correct.

(d)90000,89999 → wrong.

(e)9999,10000 → correct.

Same issue as F.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in option E.

Option E says:

(a)86430,86431 → wrong.

(b)09919,09920 → wrong.

So not E.

Option I:

(a)99999,100000 → wrong.

So no.

Option G:

(a)86321,86322 → wrong.

So no.

Option H:

(a)86411,86412 → wrong.

So no.

Option D:

(a)86422,86423 → wrong.

So no.

Option C:

(a)86423,86424 → wrong.

Option B:

(a)86419,86420 → no, because 9's is 86420.

Wait, option B's 13579's 9's is 86419, which is incorrect.

So the only options that have (a) correct are F and J, but both have (d) incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in (d). Let me check 10000 again.

Wait, 10000 is 5 digits. So 9's complement is 89999, 10's is 90000.

In option F, (d) is 90000 and 89999. So 9's is 90000, which is wrong.

In option J, (d) is 90000 and 89999. Same issue.

Wait, but what about option F's (d): 90000 and 89999. That's 9's as 90000, which is wrong.

So perhaps the correct option is F, despite the mistake in (d), because all others have more mistakes.

Wait, but I must have made a mistake because one of the options must be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the 9's complement of 10000. Wait, 10000 is 1 followed by four zeros. So 9's complement is 9-1=8, and the rest are 9s: 89999.

So 9's is 89999, 10's is 90000.

Looking again at option F: (d) 90000 and 89999. So the 10's is 89999, which is wrong. Because 10's complement is 89999 +1 =90000.

So perhaps the correct option is F, but it's wrong in (d). Wait, maybe I should check all options again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the 9's complement of 90090.

90090: each digit:

9→0

0→9

0→9

9→0

0→9

So 0 9 9 0 9 →09909. 10's is 09910.

Option F has that correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in 10000's 9's complement. Let me think again.

Wait, 10000's 9's complement is 89999, and 10's is 90000.

Looking at the options, which one has that?

Option F: 10000's 9's is 90000, which is wrong.

Option J: 10000's 9's is 90000, also wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that maybe the 10's complement is actually 90000, and the 9's is 89999. So in the options, perhaps the correct answer is F, but with (d) being wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an option that has all correct except perhaps (d). But I don't see any.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in (c). Let me check 09900 again.

09900: 5 digits.

0→9

9→0

9→0

0→9

0→9

So 9 0 0 9 9 →90099. 10's is 90100.

Looking at option F: (c) 90099 and 90100. Correct.

So F has (a), (b), (c), and (e) correct, but (d) wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should check if any other option has (d) correct.

Looking at option F: (d) is wrong.

Option J: (d) is 90000 and 89999. So 9's is 90000, which is wrong.

Option I: (d) is 99999 and 100000. Wrong.

Option H: (d) is 89999 and 90000. Correct.

But option H's (a) is 86411 and 86412. Which is wrong.

So H has (d) correct but others wrong.

So perhaps the correct option is F, even though (d) is wrong, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F, because all other options have more mistakes.

Wait, but I'm confused. Maybe I should try to see which option has the most correct.

Option F has (a), (b), (c), and (e) correct, but (d) wrong.

Option J has (a), (b), (c), and (e) correct, but (d) wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in (e). Let me check 0000's 9's and 10's.

0000: 4 digits. 9's complement is 9999, 10's is 10000.

Looking at option F: (e) 9999 and 10000. Correct.

Option J: (e) 9999 and 10000. Correct.

So both F and J have (e) correct.

But in F, (d) is wrong, but in J, (d) is wrong as well.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the options are using a different number of digits. For example, perhaps 09900 is considered as a 5-digit number, but in some options, it's treated as 4 digits.

Wait, but typically, the number of digits should be the same as the original number.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that leading zeros are not counted, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the 10's complement for 0000 is treated as 10000, which is correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the option that has 9's and 10's complements for 13579 as 86420 and 86421, which is only in options F and J.

In option F, (a) is correct, but (d) is wrong.

In option J, (a) is correct, but (d) is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is F, despite the issue with (d), because it has the other parts correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in (d). Let me think again about 10000's 9's complement.

Wait, 10000 is 1 followed by four zeros. So 9's complement is 8 followed by four 9s: 89999. So 10's complement is 89999 +1 =90000.

So in the options, the correct 9's and 10's for 10000 are 89999 and 90000.

Looking at the options, only option H has (d) correct, but its (a) is wrong.

So perhaps the correct option is F, as it's the only one with (a), (b), (c), and (e) correct, but (d) is wrong. But since all options have some wrong, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that 10000's 9's complement is 90000, but that's not correct because 9's complement is 9- digit by digit.

Wait, 10000's 9's complement is 89999, not 90000.

So the only option that has (a) correct is F and J.

But both have (d) wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an option where (d) is correct.

Looking at option H: (d) is 89999 and 90000. So correct.

But (a) in H is 86411 and 86412, which is wrong.

So perhaps the correct answer is F, even though (d) is wrong, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the 10's complement of 0000. It's 10000, which is correct in F and J.

But in F, (d) is wrong.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should conclude that the correct option is F, despite the mistake in (d), because it has the most correct answers.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the 9's complement of 10000.

Wait, perhaps 10000 is a 5-digit number, so 9's complement is 9-1=8, and the rest 9s: 89999.

So 10's is 90000.

So in the options, only option H has (d) correct, but (a) is wrong.

So perhaps the correct answer is F, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the options again.

Option F:

(a) 86420,86421 → correct.

(b)09909,09910 → correct.

(c)90099,90100 → correct.

(d)90000,89999 → wrong.

(e)9999,10000 → correct.

So F has four correct and one wrong.

Option J:

(a)86420,86421 → correct.

(b)09909,09910 → correct.

(c)90099,90100 → correct.

(d)90000,89999 → wrong.

(e)9999,10000 → correct.

Same as F.

So perhaps the correct answer is F, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the 9's complement of 09900.

Wait, 09900: 5 digits.

0→9

9→0

9→0

0→9

0→9

So 90099. 10's is 90100.

So F has that correct.

In that case, perhaps the correct answer is F, despite the issue with (d).

But I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should choose option F.

The correct 9's and 10's complements for each number are calculated as follows:

- **13579**:  
  9's complement: 86420  
  10's complement: 86421  

- **90090**:  
  9's complement: 09909  
  10's complement: 09910  

- **09900**:  
  9's complement: 90099  
  10's complement: 90100  

- **10000**:  
  9's complement: 89999  
  10's complement: 90000  

- **0000**:  
  9's complement: 9999  
  10's complement: 10000  

Among the options, **Option F** correctly provides the 9's and 10's complements for **13579**, **90090**, **09900**, and **0000**. However, it incorrectly lists the 9's complement of **10000** as 90000 instead of 89999. Despite this error, Option F is the closest match to the correct answers.

**Answer: F**
