Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about identical twins raised apart. The question is asking about what the differences in their behavior can be attributed to. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that identical twins share the same genetic makeup because they come from the same embryo that splits into two. So if they're raised apart, their environments are different. The idea is that if they're similar, it's because of genetics, and if they differ, it's because of their environments.

The question says the more difference in their behavior, the more the differences can be attributed to what. So if twins are raised apart and show more differences, that suggests that their environments had a big impact. Because they didn't share the same upbringing, their experiences, social interactions, education, etc., would shape their behaviors differently.

Looking at the options, D is "environments." That makes sense because the environments they grew up in would influence their behaviors more when they're apart. Other options like C (genetic traits) would relate to similarities, not differences. So when they're apart, differences are more about the environment.

Other options: A is about hormonal changes, which can affect behavior but are part of genetics or biology. B is innate abilities, which are also genetic. E is educational background, which is part of the environment but maybe not the broadest option. F is socialization, which is part of the environment but a subset. G is physical appearances, which isn't directly related to behavior differences. H is mutations, which are rare and not the main factor here. I is dietary habits, which can influence behavior but are a specific part of environment. J is heritability, which is about how traits are passed genetically, but the question is about differences, so environment is more relevant.

So, putting it all together, the answer should be D: environments.

The more difference shown by the behavior of identical twins raised apart suggests that the differences can be attributed to their environments, as they experienced different upbringings. 

Answer: D
