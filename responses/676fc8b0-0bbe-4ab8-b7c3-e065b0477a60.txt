Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a freight train being pulled by an engine. The question is asking for the mass of the added freight cars. Let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, let's start by understanding the problem. The engine starts from rest and pulls a freight train with a mass of 4200 slugs. After 5 minutes, it reaches a speed of 5 mph. Then, after picking up more cars, it takes 10 minutes to reach 7 mph. We need to find the mass of those added cars. Friction is the same in both cases, and there's no slipping, so I guess we can assume it's rolling without slipping, which might affect the calculations.

Hmm, the key here is probably to find the force applied by the engine and then see how the mass changes affect acceleration, which relates to force. Since the engine's force is constant, but the mass increases, the acceleration changes. But wait, the engine is at full throttle, so I think the force from the engine is constant in both cases. Friction, on the other hand, is probably dependent on the total mass because frictional force is usually proportional to the normal force, which is mass times gravity. So, friction would increase when more cars are added.

Let me jot down the given data:

Initial mass (m1) = 4200 slugs
Time to 5 mph (t1) = 5 minutes = 5/60 hours = 1/12 hours ≈ 0.0833 hours
Speed after t1 (v1) = 5 mph

After adding cars, the mass becomes m2 = 4200 + x slugs, where x is the mass we need to find.
Time to reach 7 mph (t2) = 10 minutes = 10/60 = 1/6 hours ≈ 0.1667 hours
Speed after t2 (v2) = 7 mph

We can model this using the equation of motion, assuming constant acceleration. The formula we'll probably use is:

v = u + a*t

Since it starts from rest, u is zero. So,

v = a*t => a = v/t.

But wait, acceleration depends on net force and mass. The net force is the engine's force minus the frictional force.

Let's denote F as the engine's force. Frictional force, f, is probably proportional to the total mass (m), so f = k*m, where k is some constant. But wait, in reality, friction is usually proportional to the normal force, which is m*g. So f = μ*m*g, where μ is the coefficient of friction and g is acceleration due to gravity.

But since we're dealing with slugs (which is a unit of mass in the English system, where weight in pounds is mass in slugs times g), maybe we can simplify by assuming that f = m*something. Alternatively, perhaps the units are set up so that g is incorporated, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe we can proceed without explicitly using g since it's a common factor and will cancel out.

So, the net force for the first case is F - f1 = F - μ*m1*g = m1*a1.

Similarly, for the second case, after adding mass x, the net force is F - f2 = F - μ*(m1 + x)*g = (m1 + x)*a2.

Since F is constant, we can set up equations for both cases and solve for x.

Let me write the equations:

Case 1:
F - μ*m1*g = m1*a1
a1 = v1/t1 = 5 mph / (5/60 h) = 5/(1/12) = 60 mph/h? Wait, that can't be right because 5 mph over 5 minutes (which is 5/60 hours) would be (5 mph) / (1/12 h) = 60 mph/h? That's 1 mile per minute, which is 60 mph. That seems too high, but wait, I think I made a mistake in units.

Wait, 5 minutes is 5/60 hours, which is 1/12 hours. So 5 mph divided by (1/12 hours) gives acceleration in mph per hour. So 5 / (1/12) = 60 mph/h. That's correct, but that's a huge acceleration. Hmm, maybe I should check that again.

Wait, no, wait. 5 minutes is 5/60 = 1/12 hours. So a = v/t = (5 mph) / (1/12 h) = 5 *12 = 60 mph/h. Which is 60 mph per hour, which is indeed a big acceleration. Alternatively, maybe I should convert mph to miles per second or something else, but perhaps it's better to keep the units as they are for now.

Similarly, the second case: a2 = v2/t2 = 7 mph / (10/60 h) = 7 / (1/6) = 42 mph/h.

Wait, but that's a way bigger acceleration in the second case. But wait, after adding more mass, the engine's force F should be the same, but the total mass is higher, so the acceleration a2 should be lower than a1, right? Because F is constant, but the mass plus friction is higher. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, no. Let me check the second case again. t2 is 10 minutes, which is 10/60 = 1/6 hours. So a2 = 7 mph / (1/6 h) = 7 *6 = 42 mph/h. Hmm, that's correct, but that's a much higher acceleration than the first case. That can't be right because adding mass should make the acceleration lower. So maybe I'm mixing up something in units.

Wait, perhaps I should convert the speeds and times into consistent units, like seconds and feet or meters, but maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the acceleration is proportional to (F - f)/m, and since F is constant, perhaps I can find the ratio of accelerations and the ratio of frictional forces.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express both accelerations in the same terms.

Wait, let's think in terms of the equations.

From case 1: F - f1 = m1 * a1
From case 2: F - f2 = m2 * a2

Subtract the two equations: (F - f2) - (F - f1) = m2*a2 - m1*a1
=> (f1 - f2) = m2*a2 - m1*a1

But f is proportional to mass, so f1 = μ * m1, f2 = μ * m2.

So substituting:

μ*(m1) - μ*(m2) = m2*a2 - m1*a1
μ*(m1 - m2) = m2*a2 - m1*a1

We can rearrange terms:

μ*(m1 - m2) = a2*m2 - a1*m1

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Alternatively, perhaps we can write the two equations and solve for F and μ, then find x.

From case 1:

F = m1*a1 + μ*m1 = m1 (a1 + μ)

From case 2:

F = (m1 + x) a2 + μ*(m1 + x) = (m1 + x)(a2 + μ)

Since F is the same, set the two expressions equal:

m1 (a1 + μ) = (m1 + x)(a2 + μ)

Now, we can expand this:

m1 a1 + m1 μ = m1 a2 + x a2 + m1 μ + x μ

Simplify:

m1 a1 = m1 a2 + x a2 + x μ

We can rearrange terms:

m1 a1 - m1 a2 = x (a2 + μ)

Factor m1:

m1 (a1 - a2) = x (a2 + μ)

So,

x = [m1 (a1 - a2)] / (a2 + μ)

But wait, we don't know μ. Hmm. So maybe we can eliminate μ by using the expression from case 1.

From case 1, F = m1 (a1 + μ)

From case 2, F = (m1 + x)(a2 + μ)

Set equal:

m1 (a1 + μ) = (m1 + x)(a2 + μ)

Let me expand the right side:

m1 a1 + m1 μ = m1 a2 + x a2 + m1 μ + x μ

Wait, this is the same as before. So, perhaps I can find μ in terms of known variables.

Wait, but we have two equations and two unknowns (F and μ), but since we're looking for x, maybe we can find μ in terms of a1 and a2.

Wait, let's try to express μ in terms of the accelerations.

From case 1:

F = m1 a1 + μ m1 = m1 (a1 + μ)

From case 2:

F = (m1 + x) a2 + μ (m1 + x) = (m1 + x) (a2 + μ)

So,

m1 (a1 + μ) = (m1 + x) (a2 + μ)

Divide both sides by (m1 + x):

m1 (a1 + μ) / (m1 + x) = a2 + μ

Multiply both sides by (m1 + x):

m1 (a1 + μ) = (m1 + x) (a2 + μ)

Wait, that's the same equation. Perhaps I can rearrange it to solve for μ.

Let me expand both sides:

m1 a1 + m1 μ = m1 a2 + x a2 + m1 μ + x μ

Cancel m1 μ on both sides:

m1 a1 = m1 a2 + x a2 + x μ

Bring all terms to one side:

m1 a1 - m1 a2 = x a2 + x μ

Factor x on the right:

m1 (a1 - a2) = x (a2 + μ)

So,

x = [m1 (a1 - a2)] / (a2 + μ)

Hmm, but we still have μ in the denominator. So perhaps I need another equation to relate μ.

Wait, perhaps I can express μ in terms of F from case 1.

From case 1:

F = m1 (a1 + μ)

From case 2:

F = (m1 + x) (a2 + μ)

So,

m1 (a1 + μ) = (m1 + x) (a2 + μ)

Let me expand the right side:

m1 a1 + m1 μ = m1 a2 + x a2 + m1 μ + x μ

Again, same as before. So perhaps I can subtract terms.

Wait, perhaps I can write:

m1 a1 = m1 a2 + x a2 + x μ

Then,

m1 (a1 - a2) = x (a2 + μ)

So,

x = [m1 (a1 - a2)] / (a2 + μ)

But again, I don't know μ. So perhaps I can find μ in terms of F and m1.

Wait, another approach: since F is the same in both cases, perhaps I can write the ratio of F in both cases.

Wait, F = m1 (a1 + μ) = (m1 + x) (a2 + μ)

So,

m1 (a1 + μ) = (m1 + x) (a2 + μ)

Let me divide both sides by (m1 + x):

[m1 (a1 + μ)] / (m1 + x) = a2 + μ

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can express μ in terms of a1 and a2.

Wait, maybe I can rearrange the equation to solve for μ.

Let me write:

[m1 (a1 + μ)] = (m1 + x) (a2 + μ)

Expanding right side:

m1 a1 + m1 μ = m1 a2 + x a2 + m1 μ + x μ

Subtract m1 μ from both sides:

m1 a1 = m1 a2 + x a2 + x μ

Rearrange:

m1 a1 - m1 a2 = x (a2 + μ)

So,

x = [m1 (a1 - a2)] / (a2 + μ)

But I don't know μ. Hmm. Another approach: perhaps I can find the ratio of accelerations and find μ.

Wait, let's consider that the engine's force F is constant. So, the net force F_net = F - f, where f is the friction.

So, F_net = m a.

In case 1: F - f1 = m1 a1
In case 2: F - f2 = m2 a2

Subtracting the two equations: (F - f2) - (F - f1) = m2 a2 - m1 a1
=> f1 - f2 = m2 a2 - m1 a1

But f1 = μ m1, f2 = μ m2, so:

μ m1 - μ m2 = m2 a2 - m1 a1
=> μ (m1 - m2) = m2 a2 - m1 a1

So,

μ = [m2 a2 - m1 a1] / (m1 - m2)

Hmm, that's an expression for μ. Let's plug in the values.

We know m1 = 4200 slugs.

m2 = m1 + x = 4200 + x.

a1 = 5 mph / (5/60 h) = 5 * 12 = 60 mph/h.

a2 = 7 mph / (10/60 h) = 7 * 6 = 42 mph/h.

So,

μ = [ (4200 + x)*42 - 4200*60 ] / (4200 - (4200 + x))

Simplify denominator: 4200 - 4200 -x = -x

So,

μ = [ (4200 + x)*42 - 4200*60 ] / (-x)

Let me compute numerator:

(4200 + x)*42 = 4200*42 + x*42 = 176400 + 42x

4200*60 = 252000

So,

Numerator becomes: 176400 +42x -252000 = (176400 -252000) +42x = (-75600) +42x

So,

μ = [ -75600 +42x ] / (-x) = (42x -75600) / (-x) = -42x +75600)/x ?

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

μ = [ (4200 + x)*42 - 4200*60 ] / (-x)
= [ (4200*42 + x*42) - 4200*60 ] / (-x)
= [ 176400 +42x -252000 ] / (-x)
= [ -75600 +42x ] / (-x)
= (42x -75600) / (-x)
= (-42x +75600)/x
= (75600 -42x)/x
= 75600/x -42

So, μ = (75600/x) -42.

Hmm, not sure if that helps directly. Let's think about another equation.

From case 1:

F = m1 a1 + μ m1 = m1 (a1 + μ)

From case 2:

F = (m1 +x) a2 + μ (m1 +x) = (m1 +x)(a2 + μ)

Set them equal:

m1 (a1 + μ) = (m1 +x)(a2 + μ)

Expand right side:

m1 a1 + m1 μ = m1 a2 +x a2 +m1 μ +x μ

Cancel m1 μ on both sides:

m1 a1 = m1 a2 +x a2 +x μ

Rearrange:

m1 (a1 -a2) =x (a2 + μ)

So,

x = [m1 (a1 -a2)] / (a2 + μ)

We have x in terms of μ. But we also have μ expressed as (75600/x) -42 from earlier.

So, substituting μ into x's equation:

x = [4200*(60 -42)] / (42 + [(75600/x) -42])

Simplify numerator:

4200*(18) = 75600.

So,

x = 75600 / (42 + (75600/x) -42 )

Simplify denominator:

42 -42 cancels, so denominator is (75600/x)

So,

x = 75600 / (75600/x)

Which is x = 75600 * (x /75600) )= x = x.

Wait, that's circular. That can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in substitution.

Wait, let's go back. We have μ = (75600/x) -42.

So,

x = [75600] / [42 + (75600/x -42) ]

Simplify denominator:

42 +75600/x -42 = 75600/x.

So,

x = 75600 / (75600/x )

Which simplifies to x = x. That's just an identity, which suggests that perhaps I'm missing something.

Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's consider that the engine's force F is the same in both cases.

In case 1: F = m1 a1 + f1 = m1 a1 + μ m1 g

In case 2: F = (m1 +x) a2 + μ (m1 +x) g

Set them equal:

m1 a1 + μ m1 g = (m1 +x) a2 + μ (m1 +x) g

Let's rearrange terms:

m1 a1 - (m1 +x) a2 = μ g [ (m1 +x) - m1 ]

Simplify right side:

μ g (x)

So,

m1 a1 - (m1 +x) a2 = μ g x

We can solve for x:

x = [m1 a1 - (m1 +x) a2 ] / (μ g )

But this still seems complicated because x appears on both sides. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the equation as:

m1 a1 - (m1 +x) a2 = μ g x

But I'm not sure if that's helpful. Maybe I can find μ from the first equation.

Wait, from case 1:

F = m1 (a1 + μ g )

From case 2:

F = (m1 +x) (a2 + μ g )

Set equal:

m1 (a1 + μ g ) = (m1 +x) (a2 + μ g )

Let me expand both sides:

m1 a1 + m1 μ g = m1 a2 +x a2 + m1 μ g +x μ g

Cancel m1 μ g on both sides:

m1 a1 = m1 a2 +x a2 +x μ g

Rearrange:

m1 (a1 -a2 ) =x (a2 + μ g )

So,

x = [m1 (a1 -a2)] / (a2 + μ g )

But again, we don't know μ. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can find μ g from the first case.

From case 1: F = m1 (a1 + μ g )

From case 2: F = (m1 +x)(a2 + μ g )

So,

m1 (a1 + μ g ) = (m1 +x)(a2 + μ g )

Let me write this as:

m1 a1 + m1 μ g = (m1 +x) a2 + (m1 +x) μ g

Rearranging,

m1 a1 - (m1 +x) a2 = μ g [ (m1 +x) - m1 ]

Which is,

m1 a1 - (m1 +x) a2 = μ g x

So,

μ g = [m1 a1 - (m1 +x) a2 ] / x

Now, substitute this into the x equation:

x = [m1 (a1 -a2)] / [a2 + μ g ]

Which becomes,

x = [m1 (a1 -a2)] / [a2 + (m1 a1 - (m1 +x) a2 ) / x ]

This is getting complicated. Maybe I can let x be the variable and solve the equation numerically.

But perhaps there's a simpler approach. Since the engine's force F is constant, the net force in both cases is F - f. The net force is also equal to m a. So:

F - f1 = m1 a1
F - f2 = m2 a2

Subtracting these,

f1 - f2 = m2 a2 - m1 a1

But f1 = μ m1 g, f2 = μ m2 g.

So,

μ g (m1 - m2) = m2 a2 - m1 a1

Which can be rearranged to:

μ g = [m2 a2 - m1 a1] / (m1 - m2)

But I don't know μ, so maybe I can find another equation.

Wait, perhaps I can find the ratio of the accelerations.

From case 1: a1 = F - f1 / m1 = (F - μ m1 g)/m1

From case 2: a2 = (F - μ m2 g)/m2

So,

a1 = (F/m1) - μ g

a2 = (F/m2) - μ g

Subtracting,

a1 -a2 = (F/m1 - F/m2 )

= F (1/m1 - 1/m2 )

= F (m2 - m1) / (m1 m2 )

So,

F = (a1 -a2) * (m1 m2) / (m2 - m1 )

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Wait, let me plug in the numbers to see if I can find F and μ.

Wait, maybe I can express everything in terms of F and μ, then solve.

Let me consider the two equations:

1) F = m1 (a1 + μ g )
2) F = (m1 +x) (a2 + μ g )

Set them equal:

m1 (a1 + μ g ) = (m1 +x) (a2 + μ g )

Expand:

m1 a1 + m1 μ g = m1 a2 +x a2 + m1 μ g +x μ g

Cancel m1 μ g:

m1 a1 = m1 a2 +x a2 +x μ g

Rearranged:

m1 (a1 -a2 ) = x (a2 + μ g )

So,

x = [ m1 (a1 -a2 ) ] / (a2 + μ g )

But I still don't know μ. Maybe I can express μ g in terms of F and m1.

From equation 1:

F = m1 (a1 + μ g )

So,

μ g = (F/m1 ) - a1

Substitute into x's equation:

x = [m1 (a1 -a2 ) ] / [ a2 + (F/m1 - a1 ) ]

Simplify denominator:

a2 + F/m1 -a1 = F/m1 + a2 -a1

So,

x = [m1 (a1 -a2 ) ] / [ F/m1 + (a2 -a1 ) ]

Hmm, that seems a bit better. Let's plug in the numbers.

Given:

m1 = 4200 slugs

a1 = 60 mph/h

a2 =42 mph/h

So,

x = [4200 (60 -42)] / [ F/4200 + (42 -60) ]

Simplify numerator:

4200 *18 = 75600

Denominator:

(F/4200) + (-18) = F/4200 -18

So,

x = 75600 / (F/4200 -18 )

But I still don't know F. Hmm. Maybe I can find F from case 1.

From case 1:

F = m1 (a1 + μ g )

But I don't know μ g. Alternatively, perhaps I can find F in terms of x.

Wait, from the equation above, x is expressed in terms of F, which is unknown. Maybe I can find another equation involving F and x.

Wait, perhaps I can use the expression for F from both cases.

From case 1:

F = m1 (a1 + μ g )

From case 2:

F = (m1 +x)(a2 + μ g )

Set equal:

m1 (a1 + μ g ) = (m1 +x)(a2 + μ g )

Let me divide both sides by (m1 +x):

[m1 (a1 + μ g ) ] / (m1 +x) = a2 + μ g

Multiply both sides by (m1 +x):

m1 (a1 + μ g ) = (m1 +x)(a2 + μ g )

Which brings us back to the same point. Hmm.

Maybe I can express μ g in terms of F from case 1 and then substitute into case 2's equation.

From case 1:

μ g = (F/m1 ) - a1

From case 2:

F = (m1 +x)(a2 + μ g )

Substitute μ g:

F = (m1 +x)(a2 + (F/m1 - a1) )

Expand:

F = (m1 +x) [ a2 + F/m1 - a1 ]

= (m1 +x) [ (a2 -a1) + F/m1 ]

Let me expand this:

F = (m1 +x)(a2 -a1) + (m1 +x)(F/m1 )

Rearrange terms to collect F:

F - (m1 +x)(F/m1 ) = (m1 +x)(a2 -a1 )

Factor F on left:

F [ 1 - (m1 +x)/m1 ] = (m1 +x)(a2 -a1 )

Simplify inside the brackets:

1 - (m1 +x)/m1 = (m1 - m1 -x)/m1 = (-x)/m1

So,

F (-x/m1) = (m1 +x)(a2 -a1 )

Multiply both sides by -1:

F (x/m1) = (m1 +x)(a1 -a2 )

So,

F = [ (m1 +x)(a1 -a2 ) * m1 ] / x

Hmm, but this is getting too complicated. Maybe I can plug in the numbers and see if I can find x numerically.

Let me try that. Let me denote x as the unknown and plug in the numbers.

We have:

F = [ (4200 +x)(60 -42) *4200 ] /x

= [ (4200 +x)(18) *4200 ] /x

= [ (4200 +x)*75600 ] /x

But F must also equal m1 (a1 + μ g ), but without μ, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can find F from case 1 in terms of x.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the work done by the engine equals the change in kinetic energy plus the work done against friction. But that might complicate things because I'd need to calculate distances, which I don't have.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of torque and power, but that's probably not helpful here.

Wait, perhaps I can eliminate F and μ by considering the ratio of accelerations.

Wait, let's consider the equation:

m1 (a1 -a2 ) =x (a2 + μ g )

But I don't know μ g. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can express μ g from the equation we had earlier.

From:

m1 a1 - (m1 +x) a2 = μ g x

So,

μ g = [m1 a1 - (m1 +x) a2 ] / x

Substitute this into the equation for x:

x = [m1 (a1 -a2 ) ] / [ a2 + [m1 a1 - (m1 +x) a2 ] / x ]

Let me write that out:

x = [ m1 (a1 -a2) ] / [ a2 + (m1 a1 - m1 a2 -x a2 ) /x ]

Multiply numerator and denominator by x to eliminate the fraction:

x = [ m1 (a1 -a2) * x ] / [ a2 x + m1 a1 -m1 a2 -x a2 ]

Simplify denominator:

a2 x -x a2 cancels out, leaving m1 a1 - m1 a2.

So,

x = [ m1 (a1 -a2) x ] / [ m1 (a1 -a2) ]

The m1 (a1 -a2) terms cancel out, leaving x = x. Hmm, that's just an identity again. So perhaps this approach isn't working.

Maybe I should try plugging in the answer choices to see which one fits.

Looking at the options, the possible x values are from 1000 to 2800 slugs. Let's try option C: 1200 slugs.

Wait, let me check option C: 1200 slugs.

So, x =1200.

Then m2 =4200 +1200=5400 slugs.

Now, let's compute accelerations.

a1 =5 mph / (5/60 h) =60 mph/h.

a2=7 mph / (10/60 h)=42 mph/h.

Now, from case 1: F = m1 (a1 + μ g )

From case 2: F = m2 (a2 + μ g )

Set equal:

m1 (a1 + μ g ) = m2 (a2 + μ g )

Rearranged:

m1 a1 + m1 μ g = m2 a2 + m2 μ g

=> m1 a1 -m2 a2 = μ g (m2 -m1 )

So,

μ g = (m1 a1 - m2 a2 ) / (m2 -m1 )

Plugging in the numbers:

m1=4200, a1=60, m2=5400, a2=42.

μ g = (4200*60 -5400*42 ) / (5400 -4200 )

Calculate numerator:

4200*60=252000

5400*42=226800

252000 -226800=25200

Denominator: 5400-4200=1200

So,

μ g=25200 /1200=21.

Hmm, μ g=21. That seems high, but let's proceed.

Now, check F from case 1: F =4200*(60 +21 )=4200*81=340200 slug-mph²/h.

Wait, wait, the units might be a bit off here, but let's proceed.

From case 2: F=5400*(42 +21 )=5400*63=340200. Same as case 1, so F is consistent.

Thus, x=1200 would give F consistent. So the mass added is 1200 slugs, which is option C.

The problem involves determining the mass of added freight cars to a train. The engine's force is constant, and frictional forces are proportional to the total mass. Using the equations of motion and the given data, we set up relationships between the accelerations and forces in both cases. By substituting the values and solving iteratively, we find that the added mass is **1200 slugs**, which corresponds to option **C**.

Answer: C
