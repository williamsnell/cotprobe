Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let me read through it again.

An employee works as a delivery person for a drugstore. His job is to deliver prescriptions and other items like toiletries, cosmetics, vitamins, and gift products. One afternoon, while on duty, he remembers it's his girlfriend's birthday. He buys her a perfume from the pharmacy's cosmetics section, pays $79.95, and gets it gift-wrapped. Then he drives to her house in the company van during his regular working hours, on his way to make another delivery. He was in a hurry, ran a red light, and crashed into another car. The other driver, who had the green light, tried to swerve but couldn't avoid the collision. The driver was injured, and both cars were damaged. Now, the driver is suing the drugstore for damages. The question is whether the driver will probably prevail in the lawsuit.

The options are A through J. I need to determine which one is correct.

First, I think this is a question about vicarious liability, which is when an employer is held liable for the actions of their employee if they occur within the scope of employment. So, the key here is whether the employee's actions at the time of the accident were within his job duties or outside of them.

The employee was on his way to make a delivery when he decided to go to his girlfriend's house to give her the perfume. He used the company van during his working hours. But why was he going to her house? It was because it was his birthday, and he bought her perfume. He didn't deliver it as part of his job; he personally took it to her. So, was this a personal errand or part of his job?

I remember that for vicarious liability, the employer is only responsible if the employee was acting within the scope of their employment. If the employee was on a personal errand, the employer might not be liable. For example, if an employee goes on a coffee break and gets into an accident, the employer might not be liable because it wasn't part of their job duties.

In this case, the employee was delivering items for the drugstore as part of his job. But delivering the perfume to his girlfriend wasn't part of his delivery route or job responsibilities. He used the company van, but he was going to his girlfriend's house, which seems like a personal errand. Even though he was on duty, the primary purpose of his trip was personal, not business-related.

Wait, but he was on his way to make another delivery. So, maybe he was going to the girlfriend's house on the way to that delivery. But the accident happened while he was going to deliver the perfume, which was a personal act. I'm a bit confused here. Did he deviate from his route for a personal reason?

I think the key is whether the employee was acting within the scope of his employment when the accident happened. If he was making a personal delivery, even in the company van during working hours, that might be outside the scope of his job. Employers aren't usually liable for personal actions of employees, unless it's directly related to their job duties.

So, if the employee was on a personal errand, the drugstore might not be liable. The fact that he used the company van and was on duty doesn't necessarily mean it's within the scope of employment. The reason for the trip was personal, so the employer isn't responsible for his actions during that time.

Looking at the options:

A: Prevail because using the company van. But using the van doesn't automatically make it work-related.

B: Not prevail because he paid with his own money. But that's not the main issue here; it's about whether he was on the clock and whether the action was part of his job.

C: Prevail because the driver had the right of way. That's about who was at fault in the accident, but the question is whether the drugstore is liable, not whether the employee was at fault.

D: Prevail because under control and direction. If the employee was under the drugstore's control, but if it's a personal errand, maybe not.

E: Not prevail because employee was personally responsible. That's possible, but I'm not sure if that's the main reason.

F: Not prevail because drugstore didn't cause the accident. That's more about causation, but the issue is whether the drugstore is liable at all.

G: Not prevail because no negligence in hiring. Doesn't seem relevant here.

H: Prevail because on duty. Being on duty doesn't mean the action was work-related.

I: Not prevail because outside the scope of employment. This seems correct because the employee was on a personal errand.

J: Not prevail because he paid for the perfume. Unrelated, probably.

So, the correct answer is likely I: not prevail because the employee was acting outside the scope of employment.

The key issue is whether the employee's actions were within the scope of his employment. The employee was on a personal errand, delivering a birthday gift to his girlfriend, not performing job duties. Even though he used the company van during working hours, the primary purpose of the trip was personal. Employers are not typically liable for personal actions of employees. Therefore, the driver will not prevail because the employee was acting outside the scope of his employment.
