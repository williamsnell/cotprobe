Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Moore's critique of past philosophers. The question is asking what fallacy Moore claims many past philosophers are guilty of when defining good. The options are various logical fallacies, from A to J.

First, I need to recall what Moore's stance was. Moore was a significant figure in analytic philosophy, known for his defense of ethical non-naturalism. He argued that "good" is a indefinable term, meaning it can't be defined in terms of other properties. He was critical of those who tried to define 'good' in naturalistic terms, which he saw as a mistake.

So, thinking about fallacies, the naturalistic fallacy is the mistake of equating a term with a natural property. For example, saying "good" is the same as "pleasurable." Moore criticized this because he believed 'good' was a non-natural property. This fallacy is also known as the confusion between 'is' and 'ought.'

Looking at the options, D is the naturalistic fallacy. That seems to fit because Moore was pointing out that philosophers were incorrectly trying to define 'good' in natural terms, committing this fallacy.

Other options: A is false dilemma, which is presenting two options as the only possibilities. Not relevant here. B is appeal to authority, which is using authority as evidence without justification. Moore isn't talking about that. C is straw man, misrepresenting someone's argument. Again, not the issue here. E is ad hominem, attacking the person instead of the argument. F is begging the question, assuming what you're trying to prove. G is slippery slope, fearing extreme consequences from a minor action. H is red herring, diverting attention. I is circular reasoning. J is hasty generalization.

None of these other options match the specific point Moore made about defining 'good' in natural terms. So, the correct answer should be D, the naturalistic fallacy.

The correct answer is D: the naturalistic fallacy. Moore criticized past philosophers for trying to define 'good' in naturalistic terms, which he saw as a fallacy.

Answer: D
