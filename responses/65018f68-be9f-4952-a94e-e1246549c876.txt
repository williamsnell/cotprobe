Okay, so I need to answer this question about where and when cattle were first domesticated. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that domestication of animals is a key part of human history, especially the Neolithic Revolution. Cattle, I think, were one of the first animals to be domesticated. Where was this likely to happen? Well, the Fertile Crescent comes to mind, which is in the Middle East. That area is often referred to as the cradle of civilization, so it makes sense that domestication would start there.

Now, regarding the timeline. I think domestication happened around 10,000 to 12,000 years ago. Wait, but the options given are in thousands, so let me check the numbers. Option C says the Middle East about 10,500 years ago. That sounds right because I recall that the process started around 8,500 BC, which is approximately 10,500 years ago.

Looking at the options, some other places like sub-Saharan Africa (options A and I) are possibilities, but I think the domestication of cattle there was secondary, maybe after they were already domesticated elsewhere. Europe (option B) probably came later as people migrated. North America (options D and H) and South America (F) are too recent based on what I know; I think those regions were settled much later, so their domestication would too. East Asia (E) and Australia (J) also don't ring a bell for early domestication.

So, putting it together, the Middle East around 10,500 years ago is the most likely answer. That points to option C.
