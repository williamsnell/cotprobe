Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question has two parts, a and b, and I need to select the correct option from A to J.

Starting with part a: What would be the average holding of money (M) in relation to transactions cost (b), the amount of bonds (Z), and the interest rate (i)? 

Hmm, I remember something about money demand and transactions costs. Oh right, the Baumol-Tobin model comes to mind. In that model, people hold money to minimize transaction costs when converting bonds (which earn interest) into money. The idea is that there's a trade-off between holding money (which doesn't earn much or any interest) and the cost of converting bonds to money multiple times.

The formula, if I recall correctly, is derived from minimizing the total transaction costs and the opportunity cost of holding money. The average money holding M is calculated as the square root of (2bZ) divided by the interest rate i. So M = sqrt(2bZ / i). Wait, let me think again. I think the formula is M = sqrt( (2 * transactions cost * amount of bonds) / interest rate ). So yes, that would be sqrt(2bZ / i).

Now looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: M = (b + Z)/sqrt(i). That doesn't look right because it's just adding b and Z, not considering the square root relation correctly.

Option B: M = sqrt(bZ * 2i). Hmm, that has 2i multiplied inside the square root, but I think it's 2bZ divided by i, not multiplied.

Option C: M = bZ/(2i). That's a linear relation, but I remember it's a square root function, so this isn't it.

Option D: M = sqrt(2bZ/i). Wait, this looks exactly like what I was thinking! Because it's sqrt(2bZ divided by i).

Option E: M = (bZ * i)/2. Again, linear and multiplied by i, which doesn't fit.

Option F: M = sqrt(bZ/(2i)). Oh, here the denominator has 2i, but in my formula, it's 2bZ over i. So this is different.

Option G: M = 2*sqrt(bZ * i). That's a square root but multiplied by 2 and with i inside, which doesn't match.

Option H: M = sqrt(bZ) * 2i. Again, that's a product with 2i, which isn't right.

Option I: M = bZ * sqrt(2/i). That's a product, not a square root of the fraction.

Option J: M = sqrt(b/i * Z^2). So that's sqrt(bZ²/i), which is Z*sqrt(b/i). Doesn't match.

So for part a, the correct formula is option D: M = sqrt(2bZ / i).

Now part b asks how the average money holding is related to transactions cost and the interest rate. From the formula, M is proportional to the square root of (b) and inversely proportional to the square root of (i). So as transactions cost (b) increases, money holding increases, and as the interest rate (i) increases, money holding decreases.

Looking at the options again, the formula for M is sqrt(2bZ / i), so the relationship is M ∝ sqrt(b) / sqrt(i). That's exactly what option D represents.

So both parts a and b are answered by option D.

The correct answer is derived from the Baumol-Tobin model, which shows that average money holding is proportional to the square root of transactions cost and inversely proportional to the square root of the interest rate.

Answer: D
