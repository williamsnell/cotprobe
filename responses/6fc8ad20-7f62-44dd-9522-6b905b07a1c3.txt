Okay, so I've got this question about finding the shortest path in an undirected graph. Let's see, I'm a bit new to graph theory, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, the problem gives me a graph G with edges E. The edges are listed as pairs: <2,6>, <2,8>, <2,5>, <6,5>, <5,8>, <6,10>, <10,8>. So each edge connects two nodes, and since it's undirected, the connection works both ways.

The task is to find the shortest path from node 2 to node 10. The options are given as various lists, and I need to choose the correct one.

Let me start by visualizing the graph. I'll list all the nodes I can see: 2, 5, 6, 8, 10. Wait, does node 10 connect to others? Yes, it's connected to 6 and 8. So the graph looks like this:

- Node 2 is connected to 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to 2, 6, 8.
- Node 6 is connected to 2, 5, 10.
- Node 8 is connected to 2, 5, 10.
- Node 10 is connected to 6 and 8.

I think the best way to approach this is to use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, which is good for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. BFS explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, so it should give me the shortest path.

Starting from node 2:

Level 0: 2
Level 1: All nodes directly connected to 2. That's 5, 6, 8.
Level 2: From 5, I can go to 6 and 8. But 6 and 8 are already at level 1, so their children are at level 2. Let's see: 6 is connected to 5 (already visited), 2 (visited), and 10. 8 is connected to 2 (visited), 5 (visited), and 10. So from level 2, I can reach 10 through either 6 or 8.

Wait, so the path from 2 to 10 via 6 would be 2 → 6 → 10. That's two edges, so the path length is 2. Similarly, via 8, it's 2 → 8 → 10, which is also two edges. So both paths are equally short.

Looking at the options, option G is [2,6,10], which is the path I just found via 6. Option E is [2,6,8,10], which is longer. Option D is [2,5,6,10], which is three steps. Option F is [2,8,10], which is two steps as well. Wait, so F is another possible shortest path.

Wait, is F a valid path? Let me check the edges. From 2 to 8, yes. From 8 to 10, yes. So F is a valid path of length 2. So both options G and F are two edges long, but let's look at the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: [2,8,5,10] → 3 edges
B: [2,5,6,8,10] → 4 edges
C: [2,6,5,10] → 3 edges
D: [2,5,6,10] → 3 edges
E: [2,5,6,8,10] → 4 edges
F: [2,8,10] → 2 edges
G: [2,6,10] → 2 edges
H: [2,5,8,10] → 3 edges
I: [2,10] → Wait, is there an edge directly from 2 to 10? Let me check the edges. The edges given are <2,6>, <2,8>, <2,5>. So no, there's no direct edge from 2 to 10, so option I is invalid because the path [2,10] doesn't exist.

So both F and G are possible shortest paths with two edges each. Now I need to check if those paths are present in the options.

Looking at the options again, option F is [2,8,10], which is a valid path because 2 is connected to 8, and 8 is connected to 10. Option G is [2,6,10], which is also valid because 2 is connected to 6, and 6 is connected to 10. So both F and G are correct, but I'm supposed to choose the correct option from the given choices.

Wait, but the question asks for the shortest path. Both F and G are of length 2. So why are there two options? Let me check the options again to see if any of them are present.

Looking at the options, F is [2,8,10] and G is [2,6,10]. So both are present. But the answer expects only one correct option, so perhaps I missed something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the edges. Let me check the edges again:

Edges are <2,6>, <2,8>, <2,5>, <6,5>, <5,8>, <6,10>, <10,8>.

So from 2, you can go to 6, 8, or 5. From 6, you can go to 2,5,10. From 8, you can go to 2,5,10. From 5, you can go to 2,6,8. From 10, you can go to 6 and 8.

So from 2, the immediate neighbors are 5,6,8. From each of those, their neighbors are as above.

So the shortest path from 2 to 10 is either 2→6→10 or 2→8→10, both of length 2.

Looking back at the options, both F and G are present. But in the options, F is [2,8,10], and G is [2,6,10].

Wait, but the options are given, and I need to choose the correct one. So the possible correct answers are F and G. But I need to see which one is among the options.

Wait, but the options are labeled A to J, and I have to choose one. So perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I should consider all possible paths and see which is the shortest.

Let me list all possible paths from 2 to 10.

Possible paths:

1. 2 → 6 → 10 (length 2)
2. 2 → 8 → 10 (length 2)
3. 2 → 6 → 5 → 10 (length 3)
4. 2 → 5 → 6 → 10 (length 3)
5. 2 → 5 → 8 → 10 (length 3)
6. 2 → 8 →5 →10 (length 3)
7. 2 →6 →5 →8 →10 (length 4)
And so on. So the shortest paths are the first two options, each of length 2.

So the possible correct options are F and G.

Now, looking at the options given:

Options F and G are both present. So why are both not correct? Or perhaps only one is correct because the question expects a specific path, even if there are two shortest paths.

Wait, but the question says "the shortest path", implying that if there are multiple, any of them can be correct. So I need to check which of F or G is among the options.

Looking back, the options are:

Option F: [2,8,10] → correct, as it's a direct path
Option G: [2,6,10] → correct, as it's another direct path.

So both F and G are correct. But the options only allow one selection. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the edge list.

Wait, the edges include <10,8>, so 10 is connected to 8. So 2→8→10 is valid.

Similarly, 2→6→10 is valid because <6,10> is an edge.

So both paths are valid. But the options may only include one of them. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, both F and G are present. But perhaps the question expects the path with the fewest nodes, which both have 3 nodes (2,8,10 and 2,6,10). So both are equally valid.

But in the given options, perhaps only one is correct. Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option G, [2,6,10], because 6 is directly connected to 10. Or maybe F is correct. Wait, perhaps I need to think about the graph structure again.

Wait, another approach: build the adjacency list.

Adjacency list:

2: [5,6,8]
5: [2,6,8]
6: [2,5,10]
8: [2,5,10]
10: [6,8]

So from 2, the neighbors are 5,6,8.

Looking for the shortest path to 10. So the first level (from 2) is 5,6,8.

From 6, the next node is 10. So path is 2→6→10.

Similarly, from 8, the next node is 10. So path is 2→8→10.

So both are length 2, which is the shortest possible.

Now, looking at the options, F is [2,8,10], and G is [2,6,10].

So both are correct, but the options may have only one correct choice. Wait, perhaps the question expects the lexicographically smallest path or something else, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me check the edges again.

Wait, the edge list includes <6,10> and <10,8>, so both paths are valid.

So both options F and G are correct. But the options given have both F and G as possible answers. However, in the options, only one can be correct. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the graph is directed, but the question says it's undirected. So no, edges are bidirectional.

Wait, perhaps the question expects the path with the fewest nodes, which both have. So perhaps both are correct, but the options may only have one as correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the options include both F and G, and then see which one is correct.

Looking back, the options are:

A: [2,8,5,10] → 3 steps
B: [2,5,6,8,10] → 4 steps
C: [2,6,5,10] →3 steps
D: [2,5,6,10] →3 steps
E: [2,5,6,8,10] →4 steps
F: [2,8,10] →2 steps (correct)
G: [2,6,10] →2 steps (correct)
H: [2,5,8,10] →3 steps
I: [2,10] → invalid
J: [2,8,5,6,10] →4 steps

So both F and G are correct, but the options list them as separate. So perhaps the intended answer is either F or G. But the question asks for the shortest path, so both are correct, but the options may have only one. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G, but I'm not sure why.

Wait, perhaps I should count the number of edges. The path from 2 to 6 is one edge, then from 6 to 10 is another. So two edges, length 2.

Similarly, from 2 to 8 is one edge, then 8 to 10 is another. So two edges, length 2.

So both paths are equally short. Since the question asks for the shortest path, any of them is correct. But looking at the options, both F and G are present. So perhaps the answer expects both, but the options are single.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is G: [2,6,10], because in the edge list, <6,10> is present, which is a direct connection. Alternatively, it's possible that the intended answer is F.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the path that uses the fewest nodes. Both have three nodes (2,6,10 and 2,8,10), so they are equally short.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. But since both F and G are correct, and the options include both, perhaps the intended answer is one of them. But I'm not sure which one. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the edges.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the shortest path is the one with the least number of nodes. Both options F and G have three nodes, so they're equally good.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option G: [2,6,10], because it's the first one I thought of, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option F.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the path that's more directly connected. From 2, both 6 and 8 connect to 10 directly. So both paths are equally valid.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is option G, as it's the first option I considered. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is both F and G, but since the options are separate, perhaps the intended answer is G.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

The edges are:

2 connected to 6 and 8 directly. So from 2, both 6 and 8 lead to 10 in one step. So the shortest path is two steps. So the path is either [2,6,10] or [2,8,10].

Looking at the options, both F and G are present. So perhaps the correct answer is both, but since the options are single, perhaps I need to choose one.

Wait, but the options are given, and the user expects one answer. So perhaps the correct answer is option G: [2,6,10], because it's a direct path through 6 to 10.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option F: [2,8,10], for the same reason.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the path that's listed in the options. Let me check the options again.

Options F and G are both present. So perhaps the answer is either F or G. But the question expects one answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option G: [2,6,10], because in the edge list, 6 is connected to 10 directly. So the path is 2→6→10, which is two steps.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer is option G.
</think>

The shortest path from node 2 to node 10 can be found using BFS. Starting at node 2, the immediate neighbors are 5, 6, and 8. From these, 6 and 8 directly connect to node 10, forming two valid shortest paths: [2, 6, 10] and [2, 8, 10]. Both paths have a length of 2. Among the options, [2, 6, 10] is listed as option G. 

Answer: G
