Question:

Doug Dogman had a domesticated golden retriever named Rover. Rover was a good, friendly dog who loved to run and chase cars but had never hurt anyone. One dark evening before the street lights turned on, Rover was chasing cars in the street, and Ginny Grandmother, aged 85, swerved to avoid hitting the dog. As she swerved, Ginny hit a parked car and suffered a head injury. If Ginny brings suit against Doug Dogman under a strict liability theory, the court will likely find for

Options:

A: Doug, unless a statute or ordinance bans unleashed dogs on public streets.
B: Doug, because Retriever is a domesticated animal.
C: Ginny, because Rover was not on a leash and was not supervised.
D: Doug, because Ginny was responsible for maintaining control of her vehicle.
E: Ginny, because Rover was chasing cars, a potentially dangerous activity.
F: Ginny, because Doug's dog was a cause in fact of Ginny's injuries.
G: Doug, because the strict liability rule for dogs would not include dogs not displaying vicious propensities.
H: Doug, because Rover was not known to be a dangerous dog.
I: Doug, because Ginny was negligent in hitting a parked car.
J: Ginny, because Doug was not present when the incident occurred.

Okay, so I have this tort law question here about strict liability involving a dog. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about whether Doug Dogman will be liable for Ginny Grandmother's injuries caused by his dog Rover.

First, I remember that strict liability usually applies to certain situations, like abnormally dangerous activities or certain animals. In the case of dogs, I think the rule is that the owner is strictly liable for injuries caused by their dog, regardless of whether the dog has a history of being vicious. But wait, is that always the case?

The question says Rover is a domesticated golden retriever who's never hurt anyone. So he's not known to be aggressive. But under strict liability, does the owner still get liable even if the dog isn't vicious? I think the general rule is yes, because it's about the type of animal and the risk they pose, not the individual dog's history.

Wait, but some states have exceptions. For example, if the dog wasn't acting in a way that's typical for its breed, maybe the owner isn't liable. But in this case, Rover was chasing cars, which is a normal dog behavior, especially for a retriever. Chasing cars isn't inherently aggressive, but it can be dangerous if it causes someone to swerve and crash.

So, Ginny was driving and swerved to avoid hitting Rover, then hit a parked car. She's suing under strict liability. The key here is whether the owner's liability is strict regardless of the dog's history.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Doug is liable unless there's a statute against unleashed dogs. That sounds like a possible exception, but I'm not sure if that's the main rule.

Option B: Doug is liable because it's a domesticated animal. Hmm, but strict liability for dogs doesn't depend on them being domesticated; it's more about the risk they pose.

Option C: Ginny wins because Rover wasn't on a leash. That's about negligence on Doug's part, not necessarily strict liability. Strict liability doesn't require the plaintiff to prove negligence; it's about the ownership and the injury.

Option D: Doug is liable because Ginny was responsible for her car. That seems like it's shifting blame, not about strict liability.

Option E: Ginny wins because Rover was chasing cars, a dangerous activity. Again, that's more about the activity causing the issue, but under strict liability, the owner is liable if the dog caused the injury, regardless of the activity's danger.

Option F: Ginny wins because the dog was a cause in fact. That's more about causation, which is a factor, but the question is about the liability standard.

Option G: Doug is liable because strict liability doesn't require vicious tendencies. This aligns with what I was thinking earlier. The fact that the dog isn't vicious doesn't matter under strict liability.

Option H: Doug is liable because the dog wasn't known to be dangerous. Similar to G, but phrased differently. Wait, H says because Rover wasn't known as dangerous, so Doug isn't liable? No, that's the opposite. If the dog isn't known as dangerous, does that affect strict liability? I think strict liability applies regardless of the dog's history.

Option I: Ginny is liable because she hit a parked car. That doesn't make sense; she's the plaintiff suing Doug, so this would be a defense if applicable, but not the main point of strict liability.

Option J: Ginny wins because Doug wasn't present. Presence isn't a factor in strict liability; the owner is liable regardless of being there or not.

So, focusing back, the key is whether strict liability applies. The general rule is that owners are strictly liable for injuries caused by their dogs, even if the dog isn't vicious. So the correct answer should be that Doug is liable, unless an exception applies.

Looking at the options, G says Doug is liable because the strict liability rule doesn't require vicious propensities. That seems correct. But wait, some jurisdictions might require that the dog has a history of aggression, but the question doesn't mention that. So G is correct.

But let me double-check. In some states, strict liability for dogs applies only if the dog is known to be dangerous. So if the dog has no history, maybe the owner isn't liable. But the majority rule is that strict liability applies regardless.

Wait, the question says "under a strict liability theory." So the court would look at whether strict liability applies. If the jurisdiction follows the majority rule, then G is correct. If it follows a minority that requires a dangerous propensity, then maybe not.

But the question doesn't indicate that the jurisdiction is an exception. So likely, the answer is G: Doug is liable because strict liability doesn't require vicious tendencies.

The court will likely find for Doug Dogman because strict liability for dogs does not require the animal to display vicious propensities. The general rule is that dog owners are strictly liable for injuries caused by their dogs, regardless of the dog's history of aggression. Since Rover, a domesticated golden retriever, was chasing cars—a common behavior for his breed—the owner's liability is not dependent on the dog's past behavior. Therefore, the correct answer is:

G
