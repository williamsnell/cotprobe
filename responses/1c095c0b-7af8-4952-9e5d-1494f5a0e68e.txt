Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem says: An ideal gas is enclosed in a chamber with a volume of 0.1 ft³ at 115°C and 690 kPa. It then expands isentropically to a final pressure of 138 kPa. I need to calculate the work done during this process. The given specific heats are c_v = 0.7201 kJ/kg·°K and c_p = 1.0048 kJ/kg·°K. The options are from A to J, and I have to choose the correct one.

Hmm, okay. So, the process is isentropic, which means it's a reversible adiabatic process. In such processes, the entropy change is zero. I remember that for an ideal gas undergoing an isentropic process, certain relations hold, like PV^γ = constant, where γ is the ratio of c_p to c_v.

Wait, right, γ = c_p / c_v. So first, I need to calculate γ. Let me compute that. c_p is 1.0048 and c_v is 0.7201. So γ = 1.0048 / 0.7201 ≈ 1.394. Let me double-check that: 1.0048 divided by 0.7201. Let's see, 0.7201 times 1.394 is approximately 1.0048. Yeah, that's right.

So γ is about 1.394. Now, for an isentropic process, the relation between pressure and volume is PV^γ = constant. Alternatively, since the initial and final states are known, maybe it's better to express the work done using the formula for work in an isentropic process.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The work done by the gas during expansion would be the integral of P dV from V1 to V2. But in an isentropic process, P and V are related by PV^γ = constant. So I can express P in terms of V and integrate.

Alternatively, I remember that for an isentropic process, the work done can be calculated using the formula:

W = (P2 V2 - P1 V1) / (1 - γ)

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Or perhaps it's more accurate to compute the work as the integral of P dV. Since P = (P1 V1^γ) / V^γ, so P = P1 (V1 / V)^γ.

So substituting into the integral, W = ∫ P dV from V1 to V2. So W = ∫ P1 (V1/V)^γ dV from V1 to V2.

Let me factor out the constants: P1 V1^γ ∫ (1/V)^γ dV from V1 to V2.

The integral of V^{-γ} dV is [V^{-(γ-1)}]/[ -(γ-1) ) ] evaluated from V1 to V2.

So putting it together: W = P1 V1^γ [ (V2^{-(γ-1)} - V1^{-(γ-1)}) ) / ( -(γ-1) ) ]

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, I think there's a formula that for an isentropic process, the work done can be expressed as:

W = (P2 V2 - P1 V1) / (1 - γ) )

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Another approach might be to use the first law of thermodynamics and the fact that for an isentropic process, the change in internal energy is related to the work done.

Wait, the first law is ΔU = Q - W, where Q is heat added to the system and W is work done by the system. For an isentropic process, Q=0 because it's adiabatic, so ΔU = -W.

But since it's an ideal gas, ΔU is also m c_v (T2 - T1). So W = m c_v (T1 - T2).

Hmm, that might be a simpler approach. But wait, I don't have the mass m, but I can find it from the initial state. Let me think.

Yes, because initially, the gas is at P1 = 690 kPa, V1 = 0.1 ft³, and T1 = 115°C. I can use the ideal gas law to find the mass m.

But wait, I should convert the units to be consistent. Let me make sure all units are in SI units. Hmm, or perhaps it's easier to work with English units since V is in ft³. Wait, but the specific heats are given in kJ/kg·°K, which uses SI units for mass and temperature.

Wait, but maybe I should convert the initial pressure to Pascals and volume to cubic meters. Let's see:

First, P1 = 690 kPa = 690,000 Pa.

V1 = 0.1 ft³. Since 1 ft = 0.3048 m, so 1 ft³ = (0.3048)^3 m³ ≈ 0.0283168 m³. So V1 = 0.1 * 0.0283168 ≈ 0.00283168 m³.

Wait, but wait, another approach: maybe using the ideal gas law in English units. Since pressure can be in psia or psig, but here it's given in kPa, which is SI. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to convert the initial state to find the mass.

Wait, the ideal gas law is PV = m R T. R is the specific gas constant, which is R = c_p - c_v. Let me compute R.

R = c_p - c_v = 1.0048 - 0.7201 = 0.2847 kJ/kg·°K.

Wait, but wait, R is usually in J/kg·K, but since the specific heats are in kJ, R would be 0.2847 kJ/kg·K. Alternatively, in J, that's 284.7 J/kg·K.

So, let's compute the mass m from the initial state. Using PV = m R T.

P1 = 690 kPa, V1 = 0.1 ft³ = 0.00283168 m³, T1 = 115°C = 388.15 K (since 115 + 273.15 = 388.15).

So, m = (P1 V1) / (R T1).

Wait, but let me make sure the units are correct. P is in kPa, V in m³, R in kJ/kg·K, and T in K.

Wait, no, let's see: P is in kPa, which is kN/m². V in m³. So P*V will be in kN·m, which is kJ. R is in kJ/kg·K, T in K.

So m = (P V) / (R T) → units would be (kJ) / (kJ/kg·K * K) ) → kg.

So m = (690 kPa * 0.00283168 m³) / (0.2847 kJ/kg·K * 388.15 K).

Let me compute that.

First, compute numerator: 690 * 0.00283168 ≈ 690 * 0.00283168 ≈ let's see, 690 * 0.00283168.

Well, 690 * 0.002 = 1.38, 690 * 0.00083168 ≈ 690 * 0.0008 = 0.552, 690 * 0.00003168 ≈ ~0.0218. So adding up, 1.38 + 0.552 = 1.932 + 0.0218 ≈ 1.9538. So approximately 1.9538 kJ.

Denominator: 0.2847 * 388.15 ≈ Let's compute 0.2847 * 388 ≈ 0.2847 * 400 = 113.88, but since it's 388, subtract 0.2847 *12 = 3.4164 → 113.88 - 3.4164 ≈ 110.4636. So denominator ≈ 110.4636.

So m ≈ 1.9538 / 110.4636 ≈ approximately 0.01768 kg. Let's say m ≈ 0.01768 kg.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Maybe I should be more precise.

Compute 690 * 0.00283168:

0.00283168 * 700 = 1.982176, so 0.00283168 *690 = 1.982176 - (0.00283168 *10)= 1.982176 - 0.0283168 ≈ 1.95386 kJ.

Denominator: 0.2847 * 388.15.

Compute 0.2847 * 388.15:

Let me compute 388.15 * 0.2847.

Break it down: 388 * 0.2847 = ?

Compute 300 *0.2847=85.41, 80 *0.2847=22.776, 8 *0.2847=2.2776 → total ≈ 85.41 + 22.776 = 108.186 + 2.2776≈ 110.4636.

So denominator is 110.4636.

So m = 1.95386 / 110.4636 ≈ 0.01768 kg.

So m ≈ 0.01768 kg.

Now, I can compute the work done using the first law approach, since for an isentropic process, ΔU = -W.

ΔU = m c_v (T2 - T1) = W.

Wait, no, because ΔU is equal to m c_v (T2 - T1), and since Q=0, ΔU = -W, so W = m c_v (T1 - T2).

So I need to find T2, the final temperature after expansion.

Since the process is isentropic, we can relate temperatures and pressures via (P1 / P2) = (T1 / T2)^{γ}.

Wait, because for an isentropic process, T P^{(1-γ)/γ} = constant. Or alternatively, T1 / T2 = (P1 / P2)^{(γ-1)/γ}.

Wait, more accurately, the relation is T2 = T1 * (P2 / P1)^{(γ-1)/γ}.

Yes, that's correct.

So let me compute that.

First, compute (γ-1)/γ. γ is approximately 1.394.

γ-1 = 0.394, so (γ-1)/γ = 0.394 / 1.394 ≈ 0.2826.

So T2 = T1 * (P2 / P1)^0.2826.

P1 = 690 kPa, P2 =138 kPa.

So P2/P1 = 138 / 690 ≈ 0.2.

Wait, 138 ÷ 690 is exactly 0.2 because 690 * 0.2 =138.

So P2/P1 = 0.2.

So T2 = T1 * (0.2)^0.2826.

T1 is 388.15 K.

Compute (0.2)^0.2826.

Hmm, let's compute that. Taking natural logs:

ln(0.2) = -1.6094.

Multiply by 0.2826: -1.6094 * 0.2826 ≈ -0.4552.

Exponentiate: e^{-0.4552} ≈ 0.6345.

So T2 ≈ 388.15 * 0.6345 ≈ let's compute that.

388 * 0.6345 ≈ 388 *0.6=232.8, 388 *0.0345≈13.376. So total ≈232.8 +13.376 ≈246.176.

Plus 0.15 *0.6345≈0.0952. So total T2 ≈246.176 +0.0952≈246.271 K.

Wait, but wait, I think I miscalculated. Let me double-check the calculation of (0.2)^0.2826.

Alternatively, using a calculator approach:

0.2^0.2826 ≈ e^{0.2826 * ln(0.2)}.

ln(0.2)≈-1.6094.

0.2826 * (-1.6094) ≈ -0.4552.

e^{-0.4552} ≈ 0.6345. So yes, that's correct.

So T2 ≈388.15 *0.6345 ≈ let me compute that precisely.

388.15 *0.6345:

Let me compute 388 * 0.6345:

388 * 0.6 = 232.8

388 * 0.0345 = let's see, 388 * 0.03 =11.64, 388 *0.0045≈1.746 → total 11.64+1.746=13.386.

So 232.8 +13.386 = 246.186.

Now, 0.15 *0.6345 =0.095175.

So total T2 ≈246.186 +0.095175≈246.281 K.

So T2 ≈246.28 K.

Now, compute ΔU = m c_v (T2 - T1). Wait, but since the process is expansion, the temperature decreases, so T2 < T1, so T2-T1 is negative. Therefore, ΔU is negative, which makes sense because the gas is doing work, so internal energy decreases.

But since W = -ΔU, then W = m c_v (T1 - T2).

So compute W = m * c_v * (T1 - T2).

m is approximately 0.01768 kg, c_v =0.7201 kJ/kg·K, T1=388.15 K, T2≈246.28 K.

T1 - T2 =388.15 -246.28 ≈141.87 K.

So W = 0.01768 kg * 0.7201 kJ/kg·K *141.87 K.

Compute that step by step.

First, 0.01768 *0.7201 ≈ let's see, 0.01768 *0.7=0.012376, 0.01768 *0.0201≈0.000355. So total ≈0.012376 +0.000355≈0.012731.

Then, 0.012731 *141.87 ≈ let's compute 0.012731 *140 =1.78234, and 0.012731 *1.87≈0.02382. So total ≈1.78234 +0.02382≈1.80616 kJ.

So W ≈1.806 kJ.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest option is H:1.8122 kJ. That's very close. So perhaps my approximation is correct.

But let me double-check the calculations, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation.

Wait, earlier I computed m as 0.01768 kg. Let me confirm that.

m = (P1 V1) / (R T1).

P1=690 kPa, V1=0.00283168 m³, R=0.2847 kJ/kg·K, T1=388.15 K.

So m = (690 * 0.00283168) / (0.2847 * 388.15).

Compute numerator: 690 *0.00283168 = ?

Let me compute 690 * 0.00283168:

0.00283168 *700=1.982176.

But since it's 690, 1.982176 - (0.00283168 *10) =1.982176 -0.0283168 =1.9538592.

Denominator: 0.2847 *388.15 ≈ let's compute that accurately.

0.2847 *388.15:

Compute 388.15 *0.2847:

Break it down:

388 *0.2=77.6

388 *0.08=31.04

388 *0.0047≈1.8236

Now add them up: 77.6 +31.04=108.64 +1.8236≈110.4636.

So denominator is 110.4636.

So m=1.9538592 / 110.4636 ≈0.01768 kg. Correct.

Now, m=0.01768 kg.

c_v=0.7201 kJ/kg·K.

(T1-T2)=141.87 K.

So W=0.01768 *0.7201 *141.87.

Compute 0.01768 *0.7201 first.

0.01768 *0.7=0.012376

0.01768 *0.0201≈0.000355

Total ≈0.012376 +0.000355≈0.012731.

Then, 0.012731 *141.87.

Let me compute this more accurately.

0.012731 *141.87:

Compute 0.012731 *140=1.78234

0.012731 *1.87= let's compute:

0.012731 *1=0.012731

0.012731 *0.87≈0.011090 (since 0.012731*0.8=0.0101848 and 0.012731*0.07≈0.00089117; sum≈0.011076)

So total for 1.87: 0.012731 +0.011076≈0.023807.

So total W=1.78234 +0.023807≈1.80615 kJ.

Which is approximately 1.806 kJ.

Looking at the options: H is 1.8122 kJ, which is very close.

So I think the correct answer is H:1.8122 kJ.
</think>

To calculate the work done during the isentropic expansion of the ideal gas, we first determine the mass of the gas using the ideal gas law. The mass is found to be approximately 0.01768 kg. Using the isentropic relation \( \frac{T_2}{T_1} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}} \), where \( \gamma = \frac{c_p}{c_v} \approx 1.394 \), the final temperature \( T_2 \) is calculated to be approximately 246.28 K. 

The work done is then determined using the first law of thermodynamics and the relationship \( W = m c_v (T_1 - T_2) \). Substituting the values, the work done is approximately 1.806 kJ. Comparing this to the options, the closest match is H: 1.8122 kJ.

Answer: H
