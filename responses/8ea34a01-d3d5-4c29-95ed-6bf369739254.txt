Question:

Two lists, list1 and list2, contain the names of books found in two different collections. A librarian wants to create newList, which will contain the names of all books found in either list, in alphabetical order, with duplicate entries removed.

 For example, if 1istl contains
 ["Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre"]
 and 1ist2 contains
 ["Frankenstein", "Dracula, "Macbeth", "Hamlet"],
 then newList will contain
 ["Dracula", "Frankenstein", "Hamlet", "Jane Eyre", "Macbeth"].

 The following procedures are available to create newList.
 Procedure
 Explanation
 Sort (list)
 Sorts list in alphabetical order and returns the resulting list.
 Combine (listl, list2)
 Creates a new list consisting of the entries from
 list1 followed by the entries from list2. The resulting list is returned.
 RemoveDuplicates (list)
 Iterates through list. If any two or more entries have the same value, the duplicate entries are removed so that any entry appears at most once. The resulting list is returned.

 Which of the following code segments will correctly create newList?

Options:

A: newList ← Combine (list1, list2)
B: listl ← Sort (listl)
 list2 ← Sort (list2)
 newList ← Combine (listl, list2)
 newList ← RemoveDuplicates (newList)
C: newList ← Combine (listl, list2)
 newList ← Sort (newList)
 newList ← RemoveDup1icates (newList)
D: list1 ← RemoveDuplicates (list1)
E: listl ← RemoveDuplicates (listl)
 list2 ← RemoveDuplicates (list2)
 newList ← Combine (listl, 1ist2)
 newList ← Sort (newList)
F: newList ← Sort (list1)
G: list1 ← Sort (list1)
H: listl ← RemoveDuplicates (listl)
 listl ← Sort (listl)
 list2 ← RemoveDuplicates (list2)
 1ist2 ← Sort (list2)
 newList ← Combine (listl, list2)

Okay, so I need to figure out which code segment correctly creates newList as described. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, the goal is to create newList that contains all the unique book names from both list1 and list2, sorted alphabetically without any duplicates. The example given helps clarify what's needed. 

Looking at the example: list1 has ["Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre"], and list2 has ["Frankenstein", "Dracula", "Macbeth", "Hamlet"]. The desired newList is ["Dracula", "Frankenstein", "Hamlet", "Jane Eyre", "Macbeth"]. So, the process involves combining both lists, removing duplicates, and then sorting them.

Now, the available procedures are Sort, Combine, and RemoveDuplicates. Each does the following:

- Sort: takes a list and returns it sorted alphabetically.
- Combine: takes two lists and returns a new list that's list1 followed by list2.
- RemoveDuplicates: takes a list and returns a new list with all duplicates removed, so each entry appears once.

So, the steps to achieve newList should be:

1. Combine list1 and list2 into a single list.
2. Remove duplicates from this combined list.
3. Sort the resulting list alphabetically.

Alternatively, maybe sorting first could be part of the process, but I think combining first is better because duplicates can come from either list.

Let me look at the options:

Option A: newList ← Combine(list1, list2). This just combines them but doesn't sort or remove duplicates. So it's incorrect because the newList isn't sorted or deduped.

Option B: Sort each list first, then combine, then remove duplicates. Wait, if you sort each list individually, then combine, you might end up with a combined list that's already in order, but when you combine two sorted lists, the order isn't merged correctly. For example, list1 after sort would be ["Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre", "Macbeth"], list2 after sort would be ["Dracula", "Frankenstein", "Macbeth", "Hamlet"]. Combining these would give ["Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre", "Macbeth", "Dracula", "Frankenstein", "Macbeth", "Hamlet"]. Then removing duplicates would remove the duplicates, but the order would be the order of the combined list before deduping. So after deduping, the order would be Frankenstein, Jane Eyre, Macbeth, Dracula, Hamlet. But the desired order is Dracula first. So this approach would not result in a correctly sorted list. Therefore, Option B is incorrect.

Option C: Combine the lists, then sort the combined list, then remove duplicates. Let's see: combining list1 and list2 gives ["Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre", "Frankenstein", "Dracula", "Macbeth", "Hamlet"]. Then sort this: ["Dracula", "Frankenstein", "Frankenstein", "Hamlet", "Jane Eyre", "Macbeth", "Macbeth"]. Then remove duplicates: ["Dracula", "Frankenstein", "Hamlet", "Jane Eyre", "Macbeth"], which is correct. So Option C works.

Option D: Only remove duplicates from list1. That won't include list2's entries, so it's incorrect.

Option E: Remove duplicates from both lists first, then combine, sort, and then... Wait, no, the code in E is: list1 ← RemoveDuplicates(list1), list2 ← RemoveDuplicates(list2), then combine, then sort newList. So combining the deduped lists and then sorting would give the correct order. Let me think: after deduping, list1 is ["Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre"], and list2 is ["Frankenstein", "Dracula", "Macbeth", "Hamlet"]. Combining them would give ["Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre", "Frankenstein", "Dracula", "Macbeth", "Hamlet"]. Then sorting this would be ["Dracula", "Frankenstein", "Frankenstein", "Hamlet", "Jane Eyre", "Macbeth", "Macbeth"]. Then no further deduping is done, but in E's code, after combining, it sorts, but doesn't remove duplicates again. So the newList would still have duplicates. So E is wrong because after combine and sort, duplicates are still present. So the final list would have duplicates.

Option F: newList ← Sort(list1). That only sorts list1 and doesn't include list2, so incorrect.

Option G: Sorts list1, but doesn't do anything else. So incorrect.

Option H: Remove duplicates from both lists, then sort each, then combine. Let's see:

list1 after RemoveDuplicates is ["Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre"], then sorted as ["Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre", "Macbeth"].
list2 after RemoveDuplicates is ["Frankenstein", "Dracula", "Macbeth", "Hamlet"], sorted as ["Dracula", "Frankenstein", "Hamlet", "Macbeth"].
Then combine them: ["Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre", "Macbeth", "Dracula", "Frankenstein", "Hamlet", "Macbeth"].
Wait, no, combining the sorted lists would be list1's sorted followed by list2's sorted. So the combined list would be ["Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre", "Macbeth", "Dracula", "Frankenstein", "Hamlet", "Macbeth"]. Then, when we sort this combined list, it would be in order. Wait, but in H's code, after combining, we don't sort again. Or do we? Let me check the code:

H's code is: list1 ← RemoveDuplicates and sort, list2 ← RemoveDuplicates and sort, then combine. So newList is the combination of sorted list1 and sorted list2. Then, is there a step to sort the combined list? No. So the combined list would be list1's sorted followed by list2's sorted. So the combined list would be ["Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre", "Macbeth", "Dracula", "Frankenstein", "Hamlet", "Macbeth"]. Then, since H's code doesn't sort after combining, the newList isn't sorted. So this would result in a list that isn't in alphabetical order. So H is incorrect.

Wait, no. Let me re-express H's steps:

H's steps:

1. Remove duplicates from list1 → remains same.
2. Sort list1 → becomes ["Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre", "Macbeth"].
3. Remove duplicates from list2 → same as before.
4. Sort list2 → ["Dracula", "Frankenstein", "Hamlet", "Macbeth"].
5. Combine list1 and list2 → ["Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre", "Macbeth", "Dracula", "Frankenstein", "Hamlet", "Macbeth"].
6. Then, is there a step to sort newList? No, H's code doesn't include that. So newList is the combined list, which is not yet sorted, and duplicates may still be present. So the order would be Frankenstein, Jane Eyre, Macbeth, Dracula, Frankenstein, Hamlet, Macbeth. Which is not sorted. So this approach doesn't give the correct newList.

So the correct approach is Option C: Combine the two lists, then sort the combined list, then remove duplicates. Because that way, all elements are considered, duplicates are removed, and the list is sorted.

Wait, let me think again about Option C. Let's walk through it:

- newList is created by combining list1 and list2. So the combined list has all elements from both, including duplicates.
- Then, newList is sorted. So after sorting, the list is in order, but duplicates are still present.
- Then, RemoveDuplicates is applied, which removes duplicates. So the final list is sorted and has no duplicates.

Yes, that works.

Another way: For example, in the sample, after combining, the list is:

["Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre", "Frankenstein", "Dracula", "Macbeth", "Hamlet"]

Then, sort this: ["Dracula", "Frankenstein", "Frankenstein", "Hamlet", "Jane Eyre", "Macbeth", "Macbeth"]

Then, RemoveDuplicates: ["Dracula", "Frankenstein", "Hamlet", "Jane Eyre", "Macbeth"], which is correct.

So Option C is correct.

Let me check the other options again to make sure I didn't miss anything.

Option E's code: list1 and list2 are deduped, then combined, then sorted. But after deduping, list1 is ["Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre"], list2 is ["Frankenstein", "Dracula", "Macbeth", "Hamlet"]. Combine them: ["Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre", "Frankenstein", "Dracula", "Macbeth", "Hamlet"]. Then sort this: ["Dracula", "Frankenstein", "Frankenstein", "Hamlet", "Jane Eyre", "Macbeth", "Macbeth"]. Then, since E's code doesn't do RemoveDuplicates after combining, the newList still has duplicates. So E is wrong.

Option H: After deduping and sorting each list, combine them. So list1 is ["Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre", "Macbeth"], list2 is ["Dracula", "Frankenstein", "Hamlet", "Macbeth"]. Combining gives ["Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre", "Macbeth", "Dracula", "Frankenstein", "Hamlet", "Macbeth"]. Then, no further sorting, so the order is not correct. So H is wrong.

So the correct answer is Option C.

The correct approach is to combine both lists, sort the combined list, and then remove duplicates. This ensures all entries are included, duplicates are eliminated, and the result is alphabetically ordered.

Answer: C
