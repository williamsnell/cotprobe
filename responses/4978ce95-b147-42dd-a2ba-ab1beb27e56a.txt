Okay, so I've got this calculus problem here about a cone with water dripping out. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I remember from my classes that related rates problems involve differentiating some formula with respect to time, so I'll need to use that approach.

The problem says water drips out at a rate of 3 cm³ per minute. The cone is upside down, but I think that just means the point is at the bottom, so as water drains, the height decreases. The cone's height is 2 cm and radius 1 cm. We need to find the rate at which the height changes when the water level is half a centimeter below the top. So, when the height is 1.5 cm left, I guess.

First, let me write down what I know:

- The volume of a cone is V = (1/3)πr²h. That's given.
- The rate of change of volume, dV/dt, is -3 cm³/min because the volume is decreasing.
- We need to find dh/dt when h = 1.5 cm.

But wait, the cone's dimensions are fixed at height 2 cm and radius 1 cm. So when the water level is at some height h, the radius of the water's surface must be proportional. Since the full cone has a height twice the radius (radius 1, height 2), the ratio of radius to height is 1:2. So, at any height h, the radius r of the water surface would be r = (1/2)h. That's important because I can express r in terms of h, so I can have everything in terms of h when differentiating.

So, substituting r into the volume formula: V = (1/3)π*( (h/2) )² * h.

Let me compute that. (h/2)^2 is h²/4, so V = (1/3)π*(h²/4)*h = (1/3)π*(h³/4) = π h³ / 12. So V = (π/12) h³.

Now, I'll differentiate both sides with respect to time t to find dV/dt and dh/dt.

dV/dt = (π/12) * 3h² * dh/dt.

Simplify that: dV/dt = (π/12)*3h² * dh/dt = (π/4) h² * dh/dt.

We know dV/dt is -3 cm³/min, so plug that in:

-3 = (π/4) h² * dh/dt.

We need to solve for dh/dt. Rearranging:

dh/dt = (-3) * (4)/(π h²) ) = (-12)/(π h²).

Now, we're asked for dh/dt when the water level is half a centimeter below the top. The total height is 2 cm, so half a cm below the top would be 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 cm. So h = 1.5 cm.

Plug h = 1.5 into dh/dt:

dh/dt = (-12)/(π * (1.5)^2).

Calculate (1.5)^2: that's 2.25.

So dh/dt = (-12) / (π * 2.25) = (-12)/(2.25 π).

Simplify 12 divided by 2.25. Let me compute that: 2.25 is 9/4, so 12/(9/4) = 12 * (4/9) = 48/9 = 16/3.

Wait, wait. Let me check that again. 12 divided by 2.25. 2.25 is 9/4, so 12 ÷ (9/4) = 12 * (4/9) = (12/9)*4 = (4/3)*4 = 16/3. So 12/2.25 is 16/3.

So dh/dt = (-16/3)/π = -16/(3π) cm/min.

Looking at the options, option J is -16/(3π) cm/min. So the answer is J.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes.

Wait, when I substituted h=1.5, I had dh/dt = -12/(π*(1.5)^2) = -12/(π*2.25) = -12/(2.25 π).

12 divided by 2.25 is indeed 5.333... which is 16/3. So yes, that gives -16/(3π). So I think J is correct.

To solve the problem, we start by noting the volume of a cone is \( V = \frac{\pi}{3}r^2h \). Since the cone's height and radius are fixed at 2 cm and 1 cm, respectively, the radius of the water surface at any height \( h \) is \( r = \frac{h}{2} \). Substituting \( r \) into the volume formula gives \( V = \frac{\pi}{12}h^3 \). Differentiating with respect to time \( t \), we find \( \frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{\pi}{4}h^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \). Given \( \frac{dV}{dt} = -3 \, \text{cm}^3/\text{min} \), solving for \( \frac{dh}{dt} \) yields \( \frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{-12}{\pi h^2} \). When \( h = 1.5 \, \text{cm} \), substituting gives \( \frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{-16}{3\pi} \, \text{cm/min} \).
