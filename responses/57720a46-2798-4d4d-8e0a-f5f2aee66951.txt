Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about which drugs inhibit herpes viruses. The options are A through D: Amantadine, Acyclovir, Oseltamivir, and Azidothymidine. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that herpes viruses include HSV (Herpes Simplex Virus) and VZV (Varicella-Zoster Virus). I think there are specific antiviral medications used for these. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Amantadine. I recall that Amantadine is used for treating Parkinson's disease, but I also think it has some antiviral uses. Maybe it's used against influenza? Or wait, wasn't there another drug similar to it? Oh right, rimantadine is another antiviral, but I'm not sure about amantadine. I think it's primarily used for Parkinson's, but maybe it's effective against some viruses like herpes zoster? Or was that a different one.

Option B: Acyclovir. I'm pretty sure Acyclovir is an antiviral drug. I remember it's used for treating herpes infections, including cold sores, genital herpes, and shingles. It works by inhibiting the replication of the herpes virus. So this seems like a strong candidate.

Option C: Oseltamivir. I know Oseltamivir as Tamiflu, which is used to treat influenza. It's an antiviral that inhibits neuraminidase, preventing the virus from spreading in the body. So it's specific to flu, not herpes.

Option D: Azidothymidine. Wait, that sounds familiar. I think Azidothymidine is also known as AZT. Oh yes, AZT is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, used primarily in HIV treatment. It's one of the older antiretrovirals. So it doesn't target herpes viruses.

So putting it all together. Acyclovir (B) is the herpes inhibitor. Amantadine might have some antiviral activity, but I think it's more for Parkinson's. Oseltamivir is for flu, and AZT is for HIV. Therefore, the correct answer should be B: Acyclovir.

The correct answer is B: Acyclovir, as it is a known antiviral that inhibits herpes viruses.
