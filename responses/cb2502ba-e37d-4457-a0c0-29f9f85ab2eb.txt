Question:

A city passed a picketing ordinance. Section 202 of that ordinance reads:"Section 202. It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in picketing before or about the residence of an individual. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit the holding of a meeting or assembly on any premises used for the discussion of subjects of general public interest. "A group of teachers who work for a public school inside of the city were angry that the principal decreased their salaries. The teachers reacted by picketing on the lawn of the principal's privately owned house. The teachers were charged with violating Section 202 of the ordinance. The teachers have filed suit attacking the constitutionality of Section 202. The court will most likely declare Section 202

Options:

A: constitutional, as a valid exercise of a state's reserved powers under the Tenth Amendment.
B: unconstitutional, as discriminatory on its face.
C: constitutional, as it is within the city's power to regulate public disturbances.
D: constitutional, as it does not interfere with the teachers' ability to protest in other locations.
E: unconstitutional, as a violation of the right to free speech.
F: unconstitutional, as it limits the teachers' right to express their grievances.
G: unconstitutional, as vague and overbroad.
H: constitutional, as a permissible time, place, and manner regulation.
I: constitutional, as it protects the privacy of individuals in their homes.
J: unconstitutional, as it infringes upon the right to peaceful assembly.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this constitutional law question. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about a city ordinance, specifically Section 202, which prohibits picketing before or about the residence of an individual. There's an exception for meetings or assemblies on premises used for discussing general public interest. 

So, the scenario is that a group of teachers, who work in a public school within the city, are upset because their principal decreased their salaries. They decided to picket on the lawn of the principal's privately owned house. They were charged under Section 202, and now they're suing, claiming the ordinance is unconstitutional.

I need to determine what the court is likely to decide regarding the constitutionality of Section 202. The options are from A to J, each giving a different reason.

First, I should think about the constitutional principles involved. Picketing is a form of protest, which is protected under the First Amendment as a form of speech. However, the government can impose reasonable restrictions on the time, place, and manner of such speech, provided they meet certain criteria.

In this case, the ordinance prohibits picketing around a residence. The teachers are picketing the principal's home because they're protesting a decision made by that principal. So, the issue is whether the ordinance is a permissible restriction or an unconstitutional limitation on free speech.

I remember that in the case of Hague v. CIO, the Supreme Court held that a city ordinance prohibiting picketing in front of a private residence was unconstitutional because it was an unreasonable restriction on the right to peaceful assembly. The Court said that such a ban was too broad because it could prevent people from peacefully assembling to express their views, even if they were doing so lawfully elsewhere.

Another relevant case is the one involving the notion of "chalking" outside homes, but that's more about prior restraints and content neutrality. However, in this case, the issue is about the location of picketing near a residence.

Looking at Section 202, it prohibits picketing around a residence but allows meetings or assemblies on premises used for public interest discussions. This seems to target picketing specifically near homes, which could be seen as an attempt to silence speech directed at individuals in their private spaces.

The teachers are arguing that this ordinance infringes on their free speech. The city, on the other hand, might argue that it's a reasonable regulation to protect individuals' privacy and prevent disturbances.

But wait, under the First Amendment, the government can't completely ban picketing in residential areas unless it's for a compelling reason and is narrowly tailored. The Supreme Court has been strict about such bans. For example, in Watchtower Bible v. Stratton, the Court struck down an ordinance that required a permit for all public speaking in residential areas, finding it unconstitutional because it was overbroad and not content-neutral.

In this case, the ordinance is specifically targeting picketing near homes, which is a specific type of speech. It doesn't allow for any exceptions except for public meetings, which the teachers aren't doingâ€”they're picketing. So, this seems like a blanket ban on picketing near homes, which would likely be struck down as unconstitutional because it's not narrowly tailored and may not allow for adequate alternatives.

Looking at the options:

A: constitutional under Tenth Amendment. That seems less likely because the issue is about free speech, not state vs. federal powers.

B: unconstitutional on its face. This is possible if the law is discriminatory or overly broad.

C: constitutional as regulating public disturbances. The problem is that the law isn't just about disturbances; it's a complete ban on picketing near homes, which might not be a disturbance.

D: constitutional because it allows other locations. But the First Amendment requires that the regulation isn't a complete ban. The teachers are being prevented from picketing where they want, even if they can protest elsewhere. The question is about whether the restriction is too broad.

E: unconstitutional as a free speech violation. This seems plausible because picketing is speech, and a ban on it near homes might infringe on that.

F: unconstitutional as limiting the right to express grievances. This is similar to E but more specific. The teachers are expressing a grievance, so this option is relevant.

G: unconstitutional as vague and overbroad. The ordinance seems specific, not vague. But it might be overbroad if it prohibits more speech than necessary.

H: constitutional as a permissible time, place, manner regulation. The issue is whether it's a permissible regulation. If it's a complete ban, it's not a permissible regulation.

I: constitutional as protecting privacy. While protecting privacy is a valid interest, the question is whether the ordinance is the least restrictive means. There might be less restrictive ways to protect privacy without banning all picketing.

J: unconstitutional as infringing on peaceful assembly. This aligns with the idea that the ordinance prohibits assembly near homes, which is a right protected by the First Amendment.

So, the key cases suggest that a complete ban on picketing near homes is unconstitutional because it's a content-neutral restriction but overly broad. In Hague v. CIO, the Court found that prohibiting picketing in front of a residence was unconstitutional because it prevented people from assembling peacefully to express their views, even if they could do so elsewhere.

Therefore, the court is likely to find Section 202 unconstitutional as it infringes on the right to peaceful assembly, making option J the correct answer.

The court is likely to declare Section 202 unconstitutional because it infringes on the right to peaceful assembly, as established in cases like Hague v. CIO. The ordinance broadly prohibits picketing near residences, which is an unreasonable restriction on First Amendment rights, even though it allows other forms of expression. This overbroad ban is not a permissible time, place, and manner regulation, as it fails to meet the narrow tailoring requirement and unduly limits the teachers' ability to protest. 

Answer: J
