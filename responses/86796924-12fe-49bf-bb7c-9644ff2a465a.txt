Okay, so I have this economics question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me take it step by step. The question is about whether certain economic events represent a change in supply or a change in quantity supplied. I remember that supply and quantity supplied are related but different concepts.

First, I think I should recall the definitions. A change in supply refers to a shift in the entire supply curve. This happens when there are factors other than the price of the good that affect how much suppliers are willing to provide. Examples include changes in production costs, technology, taxes, subsidies, or weather conditions (like in the first part of the question).

On the other hand, a change in quantity supplied refers to a movement along the same supply curve. This happens when the price of the good itself changes, leading suppliers to provide more or less of the good at that new price.

Now, looking at the question, there are three parts: a, b, and c.

Let's tackle each one.

a) Cold weather in Florida destroys a great deal of the orange crop. Therefore, there are fewer oranges in the country's supermarkets.

Hmm. Cold weather affecting the orange crop sounds like a factor that would change the supply. Since the weather is a factor that affects production, it's an external factor causing the supply curve to shift. So this should be a change in supply, not a change in quantity supplied. So for part a), it's a change in supply.

b) The cost of limes increases. As a result, bar owners raise the price of gin and tonics.

Wait, the cost of limes goes up. Since limes are an ingredient in gin and tonics, their cost increase would affect the supply of gin and tonics. So the supply of gin and tonics would decrease because it's more expensive to make them. Bar owners raising the price is a response to this higher cost, which means they are now supplying less at each price point, but the price itself isn't the causeâ€”the cost is. So this is a change in supply.

Wait, but the question says "bar owners raise the price." So the price of gin and tonics goes up. Does that mean it's a change in quantity supplied or a change in supply? I think it's a change in supply because the cost (a factor other than price) has changed, leading to a shift in the supply curve. Therefore, the price change is a result of the supply change, not a movement along the same curve. So part b) is a change in supply.

Wait, but wait. The cost of limes is an input cost. When input costs increase, the supply curve shifts left, meaning at every price, suppliers are willing to supply less. So the bar owners raising the price is a response to a change in their cost structure. So the change in the price is a result of the change in supply. So part b) is a change in supply.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased: "the cost of limes increases. As a result, bar owners raise the price of gin and tonics." So the action is raising the price. So actually, the bar owners are changing the price, which could be interpreted as a change in quantity supplied. But wait, no. Because the change in price is due to a change in a determinant of supply (costs), not because the price itself changed. So it's a shift in supply.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. When the cost of production increases, the supply curve shifts left. So at any given price, the quantity supplied is less. So if the bar owners raise the price, that's their way of adjusting to the higher cost, but the underlying cause is the change in supply. So the event is a change in supply.

Wait, but in reality, when the cost of inputs goes up, the supplier might choose to either reduce production (so quantity supplied decreases) or raise prices. So the change in price is the result of the change in supply. So in this case, the event is a change in supply because it's due to a change in a factor other than price.

Wait, but the question is about whether the event represents a change in supply or a change in quantity supplied. So in part b), the event is that the cost of limes increases, leading to a price increase. So the cost change is the cause, which is a change in supply, and the price change is a response. So part b) is a change in supply.

Wait, but another perspective: when the cost of limes increases, the bar owners can either sell the same quantity at a higher price or reduce the quantity supplied. If they raise the price, that's a movement along the demand curve, but that's not it. No, wait, the price is set by the bar owners in response to higher costs, so it's more about the supply curve shifting, leading to a new equilibrium where the price is higher and quantity supplied is lower. So the event is a change in supply.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased: "the cost of limes increases. As a result, bar owners raise the price of gin and tonics." So the question is, does this represent a change in supply or a change in quantity supplied.

I think the correct answer is that it's a change in supply because the cost is an external factor causing the supply curve to shift. Therefore, the correct classification for part b) is change in supply.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me think again. If the price of the good (gin and tonic) increases because the cost of producing it (limes) increases, that's a change in supply. Because the bar owners are now supplying less at each price point because it's more expensive. So the overall supply has decreased, which is a change in supply.

So part b) is a change in supply.

Wait, but looking at the options, I need to check each part correctly.

Now part c): The price of leather shoes goes up. This induces manufacturers of leather shoes to increase production.

Wait, the price of the good itself (leather shoes) has gone up. So when the price increases, manufacturers are induced to produce more. This is a movement along the supply curve, not a shift. So this is a change in quantity supplied, because the price change leads to a change in how much is supplied at that new price.

So part c) is a change in quantity supplied.

Wait, but wait. The question says "the price of leather shoes goes up. This induces manufacturers to increase production." So if the price goes up, and they produce more, that's a change in quantity supplied. Because it's the same supply curve; the price change causes a movement along the curve, leading to higher quantity supplied.

So to recap:

a) Change in supply (weather affects production)
b) Change in supply (cost increase)
c) Change in quantity supplied (price change induces more production)

Now looking at the options, let's see which one matches.

Option D: a) Change in supply, b) Change in quantity supplied, c) None of the above.

Wait, no, because I thought b) is change in supply, but option D says b) is change in quantity supplied. So that would not match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in part b). Let me reevaluate.

In part b), the cost of limes increases. Bar owners raise the price of gin and tonics. So the cost is an external factor causing the supply curve to shift. So the event is a change in supply. So when the price increases, that's a result of the supply shift, meaning the price is now higher at the same quantity, or perhaps quantity supplied has decreased, leading to a new equilibrium.

Wait, but the question is about whether the event represents a change in supply or quantity supplied. So the event is the cost increase leading to a price increase. So the cause is a change in supply, and the effect is a change in price, which could lead to a change in quantity supplied. But the event itself is a change in supply.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, the event is the cost increase leading to a price increase. So the event is the cause, which is a change in supply. So part b) is a change in supply.

But looking at the options, let's see:

Looking for a) change in supply, b) change in supply, c) change in quantity supplied.

Which option matches that?

Looking at the options:

Option F: a) Change in supply, b) Change in quantity supplied, c) Change in supply. No.

Option G: a) Change in supply, b) Change in supply, c) Change in quantity supplied. That would be a) yes, b) yes, c) yes. So option G is a) change in supply, b) change in supply, c) change in quantity supplied.

But let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: a) None, b) Change in supply, c) Change in quantity supplied.

B: a) Change in quantity supplied, b) Change in quantity supplied, c) Change in supply.

C: All none.

D: a) Change in supply, b) Change in quantity supplied, c) None.

E: a) Change in quantity supplied, b) None, c) Change in supply.

F: a) Change in supply, b) Change in quantity supplied, c) Change in supply.

G: a) Change in supply, b) Change in supply, c) Change in quantity supplied.

H: a) Change in quantity supplied, b) Change in supply, c) Change in supply.

I: a) Change in supply, b) Change in supply, c) Change in quantity supplied.

J: a) Change in quantity supplied, b) Change in supply, c) Change in quantity supplied.

Wait, so according to my analysis, a) is change in supply, b) is change in supply, c) is change in quantity supplied. So the correct option would be G.

But wait, looking back at part b), perhaps I was wrong. Let me think again. When the cost of limes increases, the bar owners raise the price of gin and tonics. So the cost increase is a factor affecting supply, so the supply curve shifts left. The result is that at the original price, the quantity supplied is less. But the bar owners could choose to raise the price, which would also affect the quantity supplied. So the event is a change in supply because the cost is a determinant of supply, not a change in quantity supplied.

So part b) is change in supply.

Thus, a) change in supply, b) change in supply, c) change in quantity supplied.

Looking at the options, option G matches this.

Wait, but in the options, option G is: a) Change in supply, b) Change in supply, c) Change in quantity supplied.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but let me check the options again because I might have misread.

Option G: a) Change in supply, b) Change in supply, c) Change in quantity supplied.

Yes, that's the one.

So the answer should be option G.

The question involves determining whether economic events represent a change in supply or a change in quantity supplied. Here's the analysis:

1. **Part a)**: Cold weather in Florida destroys the orange crop. This is a change in supply because it's an external factor (weather) affecting production, leading to a shift in the supply curve.

2. **Part b)**: The cost of limes increases, leading bar owners to raise the price of gin and tonics. This is also a change in supply because the cost of production is an external factor causing the supply curve to shift.

3. **Part c)**: The price of leather shoes increases, inducing manufacturers to produce more. This is a change in quantity supplied because the price change directly affects the quantity supplied at the new price level, which is a movement along the supply curve.

Based on this analysis, the correct option is:

**G: a) Change in supply, b) Change in supply, c) Change in quantity supplied**

The answer is G.
