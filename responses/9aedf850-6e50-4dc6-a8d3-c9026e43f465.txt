Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a diving bell. Let me read it again to understand what's being asked. 

The problem says: A diving bell has an air space of 3.0 cubic meters when it's on the deck of a boat. The question is, what's the volume of the air space when the bell is lowered to a depth of 50 meters? The mean density of seawater is given as 1.025 grams per cubic centimeter, and we can assume the temperature is the same as on the surface. The options are A through J, with various volumes.

Hmm, I remember that pressure changes with depth in water, and that affects gases. Oh right, it's about the pressure increasing as you go deeper, which would compress the air inside the diving bell. So the volume of air should decrease because pressure increases.

Wait, the diving bell is a rigid structure, right? So the actual container doesn't change size. Wait no, no, wait. Wait, no, the diving bell is a structure that encloses a certain volume of air. When it's submerged, the water pressure increases, which would compress the air inside, reducing its volume. But wait, no, in reality, a diving bell is a rigid container, so maybe the volume doesn't change? That can't be right because the question is asking about the change in volume, so perhaps the model here is that the bell's air space is flexible or that the pressure affects the air volume.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The diving bell is lowered into the water, so the surrounding water exerts pressure on it. The air inside is at a higher pressure than atmospheric pressure because of the water depth. So the air volume would change according to the pressure.

Wait, but if the bell is rigid, then the volume of the air inside wouldn't change. So maybe the problem is assuming that the bell's volume is fixed, but the question is about the air inside, which is subject to pressure changes. Wait, but the problem says the air space is 3.0 m³ on deck, so when submerged, with higher pressure, the volume would decrease.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to approach this step by step.

First, I need to calculate the pressure at 50 meters depth. Seawater pressure increases with depth. The pressure at a certain depth in a fluid is given by P = ρgh, where ρ is the density, g is acceleration due to gravity, and h is the depth.

The density of seawater is given as 1.025 g/cm³. I need to convert that into kg/m³ because standard units for pressure in Pascals use kg, meters, and seconds.

So 1 g/cm³ is equal to 1000 kg/m³. Therefore, 1.025 g/cm³ is 1025 kg/m³.

The depth h is 50 meters.

So P = ρgh = 1025 kg/m³ * 9.81 m/s² * 50 m.

Calculating that:

1025 * 9.81 = approximately 1025 * 10 = 10250, but since 9.81 is slightly less, maybe around 10050 kg/(m·s²), which is equivalent to 10050 Pascals per meter? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1025 * 9.81 is about 10,050. So 10,050 Pascals per meter, multiplied by 50 meters gives P = 10,050 * 50 = 502,500 Pascals.

Wait, but wait, the pressure at the surface is atmospheric pressure, which is about 101,325 Pascals. So the total pressure at 50 meters would be atmospheric plus the pressure from the water column.

Wait, so P_total = P_atm + ρgh.

But the problem says the temperature is the same, so we can use the combined gas law, but since temperature is constant, it's Boyle's Law, which states that P1 V1 = P2 V2, assuming temperature is constant.

So when the bell is on deck, the pressure is atmospheric pressure, and the volume is 3.0 m³. When submerged, the pressure increases, so the volume decreases.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The volume of the diving bell itself is fixed, right? So maybe the air inside is compressed. So perhaps the volume of air would decrease because the pressure increases.

Wait, but if the bell's volume is fixed, then the air volume can't change. But that can't be right because the question is asking for a change in volume. So perhaps the problem is considering the air inside as being subject to the pressure, so the volume changes.

Wait, maybe the diving bell's air space is flexible, but that's not typical. Typically, a diving bell is a rigid structure, so the volume of the air inside would remain the same, but the pressure would increase. But the question is about the volume, so perhaps they're considering that the volume changes due to the external pressure.

Hmm, maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the volume of the air space changes with pressure, and apply Boyle's Law.

So at the surface: P1 = atmospheric pressure, V1 = 3.0 m³.

At depth: P2 = P_atm + ρgh, and V2 is what we're solving for.

So applying Boyle's Law: P1 V1 = P2 V2.

So V2 = (P1 / P2) * V1.

But wait, P1 is 1 atm, which is 101,325 Pa, and P2 is 502,500 Pa + 101,325 Pa? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the pressure at 50 meters is just the pressure due to the water, plus atmospheric pressure. So P2 = 101,325 + (1025 * 9.81 * 50).

Wait, let me calculate that again.

First, calculate the pressure from the water: ρgh.

ρ = 1025 kg/m³.

g = 9.81 m/s².

h = 50 m.

So ρgh = 1025 * 9.81 * 50.

Let me compute that step by step.

1025 * 9.81: Let me compute 1000 *9.81 = 9810, and 25 *9.81=245.25. So total is 9810 +245.25 = 10055.25 kg/(m·s²), which is 10055.25 Pascals per meter.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1025 kg/m³ * 9.81 m/s² = 10055.25 kg/(m·s²), which is the same as 10055.25 Pascals per meter.

Wait, but h is 50 m, so multiply by 50: 10055.25 *50 = 502,762.5 Pascals.

So the pressure due to the water is approximately 502,762.5 Pa.

Adding atmospheric pressure (101,325 Pa) gives total pressure P2 = 502,762.5 + 101,325 = 604,087.5 Pa.

So P1 is 101,325 Pa, P2 is 604,087.5 Pa.

Now, applying Boyle's Law: P1 V1 = P2 V2.

So V2 = (P1 / P2) * V1.

Plugging in the numbers:

V2 = (101,325 / 604,087.5) * 3.0 m³.

Let me compute 101,325 / 604,087.5.

Dividing numerator and denominator by 1000: 101.325 / 604.0875.

Approximately: 101.325 ÷ 604.0875 ≈ 0.1678.

So V2 ≈ 0.1678 * 3.0 m³ ≈ 0.5034 m³.

Wait, that's about 0.5 m³, which is option H: 0.5 m³.

But wait, let me check the calculation again because 0.5 m³ seems quite a small volume. Let me go through the steps again.

Wait, wait a second. Oh no, I might have made a mistake in calculating P2. Because when you lower the diving bell into the water, the pressure inside the bell is the sum of the atmospheric pressure and the pressure due to the water depth. So P2 = P_atm + (ρgh).

Wait, but wait, is that correct? No, wait. Because the diving bell is submerged, the pressure inside is equal to the external pressure, which is the sum of atmospheric pressure and the pressure due to the water depth.

Wait, but wait, the diving bell is a container that is open to the water, so the pressure inside is the same as the surrounding water pressure. So yes, P2 = P_atm + ρgh.

But when the bell is on deck, the pressure inside is atmospheric pressure. So when submerged, the pressure increases.

So the calculation seems correct. Let me redo the division: 101,325 / 604,087.5.

Compute 604,087.5 ÷ 101,325.

Let me see: 101,325 × 6 = 607,950. Which is a bit more than 604,087.5. So 6 times would be 607,950, which is more than 604,087.5. So 101,325 ×5.96 ≈ 604,087.5. So 101,325 / 604,087.5 ≈ 1/5.96 ≈ 0.1677.

So 0.1677 *3 = 0.503 m³, which is approximately 0.5 m³. So the volume would decrease to 0.5 m³, which is option H.

But wait, looking back at the options, option H is 0.5 m³. But I'm a bit surprised because 0.5 is a big decrease. Let me think about it again.

Wait, another approach: maybe the problem is not considering atmospheric pressure because the diving bell is a closed system. Wait, no, the problem says the air space is 3 m³ on the deck, so when submerged, the pressure would be higher. So perhaps I should include atmospheric pressure in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the pressure inside the bell is only due to the water, not including atmospheric pressure. But that doesn't make sense because the pressure inside the bell would be the external pressure, which includes atmospheric plus the water pressure.

Wait, but perhaps the question is considering gauge pressure, not absolute pressure. So maybe when calculating P2, we should only use the pressure due to the water, not adding atmospheric pressure. That could change the result.

Let me try that. If we only consider the pressure from the water, then P2 = ρgh = 502,762.5 Pa.

So then, applying Boyle's Law: P1 V1 = P2 V2.

But wait, P1 here would be the atmospheric pressure, 101,325 Pa, and P2 is 502,762.5 Pa.

So V2 = (101,325 / 502,762.5) * 3.0.

Calculating 101,325 /502,762.5 ≈ 0.2015.

So V2 ≈ 0.2015 * 3 = 0.6045 m³, which is approximately 0.6 m³. But that's not one of the options. Wait, the options are A:0.8, B:2, C:2.8, D:3.5, E:4.0, F:1.2, G:2.5, H:0.5, I:1.0, J:1.5.

Hmm, 0.6 isn't an option. So perhaps including atmospheric pressure is the correct approach, which gives us about 0.5 m³, option H.

Alternatively, maybe I should have considered that the pressure inside the diving bell is the same as the external pressure, which includes atmospheric plus the water pressure, so P2 = P_atm + ρgh.

Wait, that's what I did earlier, leading to V2 ≈ 0.5 m³. So that would be option H.

But let me check the calculation again to be sure.

Compute P2 = 1025 kg/m³ *9.81 m/s² *50 m + 101325 Pa.

First part: 1025 *9.81 = 10055.25, multiplied by 50: 10055.25 *50 = 502,762.5 Pa.

Adding atmospheric: 502,762.5 + 101,325 = 604,087.5 Pa.

So P1 V1 = 101,325 *3 = 303,975.

So V2 = 303,975 / 604,087.5 ≈ 0.503 m³.

Yes, that's 0.503, which rounds to 0.5 m³, option H.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because a diving bell's volume doesn't change, but the pressure inside increases. So maybe the volume remains the same, but the pressure increases. But the question is asking about the volume of the air space, implying that the volume changes. So perhaps the problem is treating the diving bell as a flexible container, which it's not, but perhaps it's a theoretical question.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the pressure inside the bell as only the pressure due to the water, ignoring atmospheric pressure. Let me try that again.

If P2 = ρgh = 502,762.5 Pa.

Then V2 = (P1 / P2) * V1 = (101325 / 502762.5) *3 ≈ (0.2015) *3 ≈ 0.6045 m³, which is about 0.6 m³, but that's not an option. The closest option is H: 0.5.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the gauge pressure, so P2 = ρgh = 502,762.5 Pa, and P1 is 0 (if the bell is open), but that doesn't make sense because on the surface, the pressure is atmospheric.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using gauge pressure, so P2 = ρgh, and P1 is zero, but that can't be right. Because the air inside the bell on deck is at atmospheric pressure.

Wait, maybe I should check the units again. Because 1.025 g/cm³ is 1025 kg/m³, correct.

g is 9.81 m/s², correct.

h is 50 m.

So P_water = 1025 *9.81 *50 = 502,762.5 Pa.

P_total = 502,762.5 + 101,325 = 604,087.5 Pa.

So using P1=101,325, V1=3, P2=604,087.5.

So V2 = (101325 / 604087.5) *3 ≈ (0.1678) *3 ≈ 0.503 m³.

So that's 0.5 m³, option H.

But wait, that seems too small, and I'm not sure if I made a mistake in including atmospheric pressure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider only the pressure due to the water, not adding it to atmospheric. Let me try that.

If P2 = 502,762.5 Pa, and P1 = 101,325 Pa.

Then V2 = (101325 /502762.5) *3 ≈ (0.2015)*3 ≈ 0.6045 m³, which is about 0.6 m³, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct approach is including atmospheric pressure, giving V2≈0.5 m³, option H.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 101,325 divided by 604,087.5.

Let me compute 604,087.5 ÷ 101,325.

Dividing both by 1000: 604.0875 ÷ 101.325 ≈ 5.96.

So 101,325 / 604,087.5 = 1/5.96 ≈ 0.1677.

So 0.1677 *3 = 0.503 m³. So 0.5 m³ is correct.

Therefore, the answer should be H: 0.5 m³.
</think>

To determine the volume of the air space in the diving bell at a depth of 50 meters, we use Boyle's Law, which states that \( P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2 \) when temperature is constant. 

### Step 1: Calculate the total pressure at 50 meters
The total pressure \( P_2 \) is the sum of atmospheric pressure and the pressure due to the water column:
\[
P_{\text{water}} = \rho g h = 1025 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \times 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \times 50 \, \text{m} = 502,762.5 \, \text{Pa}
\]
\[
P_2 = P_{\text{atm}} + P_{\text{water}} = 101,325 \, \text{Pa} + 502,762.5 \, \text{Pa} = 604,087.5 \, \text{Pa}
\]

### Step 2: Apply Boyle's Law
The initial pressure \( P_1 \) is atmospheric pressure (\( 101,325 \, \text{Pa} \)), and the initial volume \( V_1 \) is \( 3.0 \, \text{m}^3 \). Using \( P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2 \):
\[
V_2 = \frac{P_1}{P_2} V_1 = \frac{101,325}{604,087.5} \times 3.0 \approx 0.1678 \times 3.0 \approx 0.503 \, \text{m}^3
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion
The volume of the air space at 50 meters is approximately \( 0.5 \, \text{m}^3 \), which corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
