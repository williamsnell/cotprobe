Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Piaget's stages of cognitive development. The question is asking about when children develop internal representational systems that allow them to verbally describe people, events, and feelings. The options are A through J, each corresponding to a different stage.

First, I remember that Piaget's theory has four main stages. Let me list them out to get started. The stages are: Sensorimotor, Preoperational, Concrete Operational, and Formal Operational. Wait, but I also see some other terms in the options, like Symbolic or Abstract operational. Hmm, I think those might be subtypes or perhaps alternative terms used sometimes.

Piaget's stages, as I recall, start with Sensorimotor from birth to about 2 years. During this stage, babies are learning through their senses and motor activities, like object permanence. They don't have much language yet, so probably not the answer here.

Next is Preoperational, which is from about 2 to 7 years old. This is when kids start to use language more, but their thinking is still pretty egocentric. They can use symbols, like pretend play, which is symbolic representation. So maybe this is the stage where they can start to describe things, but I'm not sure if it's fully internal representations yet.

Then comes Concrete Operational, around 7 to 11 years. Here, kids start thinking logically about concrete events. They can do operations like reversibility, understanding that water poured from a short wide glass into a tall thin one has the same amount. But I'm not sure if this is when they develop the verbal skills to describe people and feelings.

Formal Operational is the last stage, from 11 onwards. This is where abstract and hypothetical thinking develops. They can think about things like algebra and hypothetical situations. But the question is about describing people and events, which might not necessarily be abstract.

Wait, the question is about developing internal representational systems to verbally describe things. So maybe it's about when they start using symbols to represent things in their mind. That sounds like the Preoperational stage, where they use symbols (like words) to represent objects and events. But I'm a bit confused because I thought the Preoperational stage is more about the use of language and symbols, but maybe the actual internal representation comes later.

Wait, another thought: Piaget's Preoperational stage includes the development of language and the use of symbols, but their thinking is still not logical. They can form mental images and use language to represent things. So if they're starting to verbally describe things, that would fit in the Preoperational stage.

But I'm also thinking about the term "internal representational systems." That might refer to the use of internal symbols, like language in their minds, to represent things. So during Preoperational, they start using words and symbols to represent things, which would allow them to describe events and feelings.

Wait, but isn't the Preoperational stage when they start talking a lot, so they can describe things? So the answer might be H: Preoperational.

Alternatively, I'm remembering that the Preoperational stage is when they lack logical operations, but they do have the beginning of representational thought. So yes, that's when they can start to describe things verbally.

So looking back at the options, H is Preoperational.

The correct answer is H: Preoperational.
