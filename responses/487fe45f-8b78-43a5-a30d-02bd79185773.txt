Question:

Which one of following statements about nitrogen balance is correct?


Options:

A: Positive nitrogen balance means that there is a net loss of protein from the body
B: Positive nitrogen balance means that the body is in a state of nitrogen deficiency.
C: In negative nitrogen balance the excretion of nitrogenous metabolites is less than the dietary intake of nitrogenous compounds
D: Negative nitrogen balance indicates a net gain of protein in the body.
E: In positive nitrogen balance the excretion of nitrogenous metabolites is less than the dietary intake of nitrogenous compounds.
F: Positive nitrogen balance means that the body excretes more nitrogenous compounds than it consumes.
G: In nitrogen equilibrium the excretion of nitrogenous metabolites is greater than the dietary intake of nitrogenous compounds.
H: In positive nitrogen balance the excretion of nitrogenous metabolites is equal to the dietary intake of nitrogenous compounds.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about nitrogen balance, and I need to figure out which statement is correct. Let me start by recalling what I know about nitrogen balance.

Nitrogen balance is a concept that relates the intake of nitrogen to the output. Nitrogen is a key component of proteins, so this is closely tied to protein metabolism. When the body takes in more nitrogen than it excretes, it's called a positive nitrogen balance. Conversely, when it excretes more than it takes in, it's negative. And when they're equal, it's in equilibrium.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Positive nitrogen balance means a net loss of protein from the body. Hmm, wait. Positive balance would mean that the body is retaining more nitrogen, so it's actually gaining protein, not losing. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Positive nitrogen balance means the body is in nitrogen deficiency. That doesn't make sense. If you're in positive, you have more intake than excretion, so it's not a deficiency. So B is wrong.

Option C: Negative nitrogen balance means excretion is less than intake. Wait, no. Negative balance is when excretion is more than intake. So the statement is incorrect. C is wrong.

Option D: Negative nitrogen balance indicates a net gain of protein. No, negative balance means losing more than you're taking in, so you're losing protein. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Positive nitrogen balance means excretion is less than intake. Wait, no. Positive balance is when intake exceeds excretion, so E is correct? Or wait, let me think again. Wait, positive nitrogen balance is when intake is greater than excretion. So E says excretion is less than intake, which is true. So E is correct?

Wait, let me double-check. Positive nitrogen balance means the body is storing nitrogen, so excretion is less than intake. Yes, that's right. So E is correct.

Option F: Positive balance means excreting more than consumed. No, that's negative. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Nitrogen equilibrium has excretion greater than intake. No, equilibrium is when excretion equals intake. So G is wrong.

Option H: Positive balance has excretion equal to intake. No, that's equilibrium. So H is incorrect.

Wait, but I thought E was correct. Let me go through again. Positive nitrogen balance is when the body retains nitrogen, so nitrogen intake is more than excretion. So E says: in positive balance, excretion is less than intake. Yes, that's correct.

So the correct answer should be E.

The correct statement is E: In positive nitrogen balance, the excretion of nitrogenous metabolites is less than the dietary intake of nitrogenous compounds.

Answer: E
