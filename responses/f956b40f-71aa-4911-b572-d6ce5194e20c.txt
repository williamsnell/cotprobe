Okay, so I've got this problem here about the average salary of Bedford Manufacturing Co. increasing over a 10-year period, and I need to find the starting and ending salaries. The problem says the salary rose by 60% on average, and the increase was $42.50 a week. Hmm, I should figure this out step by step.

Wait, let me think. When something increases by a certain percentage, the increase is based on the original amount. So if the salary rose by 60%, that means the increase is 60% of the original salary. But wait, the increase is given as $42.50 a week, not a percentage. Oh, right, so that $42.50 is the amount corresponding to a 60% increase on the original salary.

Let me set this up. Let's call the original weekly salary at the beginning of the period "S". During the 10 years, this salary goes up by 60%, which means the new salary is 160% of the original, right? Because 100% + 60% increase is 160%.

So, the new salary (let's call it S_end) is 1.60 * S. But according to the problem, the increase is $42.50. So the new salary is the original plus $42.50. So:

S_end = S + $42.50

But S_end is also 1.60 * S, so:

1.60 * S = S + 42.50

Let me solve for S. Subtract S from both sides:

0.60 * S = 42.50

Then, S = 42.50 / 0.60

Calculating that: 42.50 divided by 0.60. Let me do the division.

0.60 goes into 42.50 how many times? Well, 0.60 * 70 is 42, so 70 gives 42, leaving 0.50. 0.60 into 0.50 is 5/6, which is approximately 0.8333. So 70 plus 0.8333 is 70.8333, which is approximately $70.83.

Wait, but let me double-check that. 0.60 times 70.8333 equals about 42.50. Because 70 * 0.60 is 42, and 0.8333 * 0.60 is about 0.50, so yes, total is 42.50. So S is $70.83.

So part (a) is the original average weekly salary at the beginning of the period, which is $70.83. Then, the new salary is 1.60 times that, right? 70.83 * 1.60.

Calculating that: 70 * 1.6 is 112, and 0.83 * 1.6 is 1.328. So adding those together: 112 + 1.328 = 113.328, which is approximately $113.33.

So part (a) is $70.83 and part (b) is $113.33.

Looking at the options, option F is $70.83 and $113.33. So that's the correct answer.
