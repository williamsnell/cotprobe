The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A state law required vacant public school buildings to be sold at auction to the highest bidder. A church in a city located in the state wanted to acquire larger facilities for its school. The city's school board proposed a new state law that would authorize it to sell a vacant public school building, at a price below its fair market value, to the church for use as its school. If enacted, would this law be constitutional?

Options:

A: No, because the law would be favoring one religious institution over others, thereby violating the First Amendment.
B: No, because the law would violate the separation of church and state as stipulated in the First Amendment.
C: No, because a statute specially authorizing the sale of the building without competitive bidding would violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
D: Yes, because the law would not primarily or substantially support the religious activities of the church.
E: No, because the law would infringe on the rights of other potential bidders who could offer a higher price for the building.
F: Yes, because the church's use of the building for educational purposes would not constitute an establishment of religion.
G: Yes, because the law would be a fair and equitable solution to a local problem.
H: No, because the transfer of the building to the church under these circumstances would constitute an establishment of religion prohibited by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
I: Yes, because the law would be supporting education, not religion.
J: Yes, because surplus government property is not subject to the limitations imposed by the establishment clause as incorporated into the establishment clause as incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the proposed state law is constitutional. Let's break down the problem step by step.

The scenario is that a state law requires vacant public school buildings to be sold at auction to the highest bidder. But the city's school board wants to change this law so they can sell a vacant building to a church at a price below fair market value for their school. The question is whether this new law would be constitutional.

First, I should recall the relevant constitutional principles here. The First Amendment's Establishment Clause says the government can't establish a religion or favor one religion over another. So any law that excessively entangles the government with religion or shows a preference for one might be unconstitutional.

Looking at the options, the main issue seems to be about whether this law violates the Establishment Clause or other parts of the Constitution.

Option A says it's unconstitutional because it favors one religious institution, violating the First Amendment. That sounds plausible because the law is specifically authorizing the sale to this church, which is a religious institution. But I need to think if favoring one religious institution is a problem. The Establishment Clause prohibits the government from preferring one religion over others, so this could be a problem.

Option B says it's unconstitutional due to separation of church and state. That's a general principle, but the specific issue here is more about favoritism or establishment.

Option C argues it's unconstitutional because it's a special statute without competitive bidding, violating equal protection. Equal protection usually involves treating people differently without a rational basis. If the law allows selling below market value only to the church, that might be unequal treatment. But equal protection is under the Fourteenth Amendment, and the question is whether this is a violation. But I'm not sure if this is the main issue here, since the main concern is likely the Establishment Clause.

Option D says yes because the law doesn't primarily support religious activities. Hmm, maybe the purpose is to help the church's school, which is a religious institution. If the primary effect is supporting religion, that's a problem. So D's reasoning might be incorrect.

Option E suggests it infringes on other bidders' rights. That's more about property rights and competition, but the constitutional issue here is likely about religion, not equal treatment in bidding.

Option F says yes because it's for educational purposes. But the church's school is part of their religious activities. So using public funds or property to support a religious institution's school might be seen as supporting religion, which violates the Establishment Clause.

Option G says yes because it's a fair solution. That doesn't seem to address the constitutional issues; it's more of a policy argument.

Option H says no because it would establish religion, violating the First and Fourteenth Amendments. This seems similar to A and B, but more specific about establishment. The law would be using state property to aid a religious institution, which might be seen as an establishment.

Option I says yes because it's supporting education, not religion. But the church's school is likely a religious school, so supporting it might be seen as supporting religion. So I think I is incorrect because even if it's educational, the institution is religious, so it's a close call but probably a violation.

Option J says yes because surplus property isn't subject to the Establishment Clause. Wait, I remember something about the government being able to sell surplus property to religious groups as long as it's not a direct aid. For example, in cases like Everson v. Board of Education, the Court allowed the state to reimburse parents for bus fares to parochial schools because it was a public welfare measure. But in other cases, like when the government donates or gives property directly to a religious institution, that's seen as an establishment. So if the state is selling below market value to the church, is that a problem? If the sale is at a discount, does that count as aid? Or is it just a business transaction?

Wait, the original law requires selling at auction to the highest bidder. The proposed law changes that to allow selling below market value to the church. So it's not just selling surplus; it's a special exception for the church. That seems problematic because it's singling out a religious institution. So the key issue is whether this constitutes an unconstitutional favoritism or an establishment.

Another angle: The Lemon Test. For laws concerning religion, the Court uses the Lemon Test, which has three prongs: the law must have a secular purpose, a primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion, and must not result in excessive government entanglement with religion.

In this case, the purpose is to help the church get a school. The primary effect would be to aid the church's religious activities. Additionally, the law is specifically targeting a religious institution, which might show a preference, violating the Establishment Clause.

So looking back at the options, H says it would constitute an establishment, which aligns with this reasoning. Option A is about favoring one religious institution, which is more about the Free Exercise or Establishment Clause. But the main issue is whether the law is establishing religion or showing preference.

Option J claims that surplus property isn't subject to the Establishment Clause. But in the case of Board of Education v. Allen, the Court allowed the state to lend textbooks to students attending parochial schools, reasoning that it was a secular purpose and didn't have the primary effect of advancing religion. However, when the government directly transfers property to a religious institution, it's more likely to be seen as an establishment. So if the state is selling below market value, it's still a transfer of property, which could be seen as aid, hence unconstitutional.

So the correct answer is likely H because it violates the Establishment Clause by transferring property to support a religious institution, which is prohibited.

The proposed law allowing the city's school board to sell a vacant public school building below market value to a church for its school likely violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The law specifically favors a religious institution, which could be seen as advancing religion and showing preference, thereby constituting an unconstitutional establishment of religion. 

Answer: H
