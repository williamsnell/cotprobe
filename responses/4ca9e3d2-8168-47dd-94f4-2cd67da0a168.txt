Okay, so I have this matrix A, which is a 3x3 matrix where every element is 1. The question is asking about the rank of this matrix. Hmm, I remember that the rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns. Right, so I need to figure out how many of these rows or columns are linearly independent.

Let me think about the rows first. All three rows are [1,1,1]. So, if I take the first row, the second row is exactly the same as the first, and the third row is also the same. That means each subsequent row isn't adding any new information. So, if I subtract the first row from the second, I get all zeros, and the same if I subtract the first from the third. So, the second and third rows are linearly dependent on the first row. That suggests that the rank is 1 because only the first row is independent, and the others depend on it.

Wait, but maybe I should check the columns too. Each column is [1,1,1]. So, the first column is all ones, the second is the same, and the third is the same. If I take any two columns, say the first and second, they are identical. So, the second column is a multiple of the first (specifically, 1 times the first). Similarly, the third column is also a multiple of the first. So, all columns are linearly dependent on the first column. That again points to the rank being 1.

Another approach is to compute the determinant of the matrix. If the determinant is zero, the matrix is singular, and its rank is less than the number of rows or columns. For a 3x3 matrix where all elements are 1, the determinant should be zero because the rows are linearly dependent. Let me quickly calculate it. The determinant of a 3x3 matrix with all ones is 0 because, for example, adding all rows together gives a row of zeros, which means the rows are linearly dependent. So the determinant is zero, confirming that the matrix is rank deficient. Since it's a 3x3 matrix, the maximum rank it could have is 3, but since the determinant is zero, it's less. Since we've already established that only one row is independent, the rank is 1.

I don't think it's 0 because the matrix isn't the zero matrix. All the elements are ones, so there's definitely some information there. So the rank can't be zero. Also, the options don't include anything beyond 5, so I'm confident it's not any of those higher numbers. So yeah, the rank is definitely 1.

The matrix A is a 3x3 matrix where all elements are 1. To determine its rank, we analyze the linear independence of its rows and columns. All rows and columns are identical, indicating linear dependence. The determinant is zero, confirming the matrix is singular. Since only one row (or column) is linearly independent, the rank is 1.

Answer: D
