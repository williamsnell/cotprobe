Question:

A previously healthy 22-year-old college student is brought to the emergency department by her parents 20 minutes after they observed her having a seizure. After the seizure, she was confused and had difficulty thinking of some words. She has had a headache, cough, and fever for 3 days treated with acetaminophen and dextromethorphan. Her temperature is 38.9°C (102°F). Neurologic examination shows diffuse hyperreflexia. On mental status examination, she is confused and has short-term memory deficits. She has difficulty naming objects and makes literal paraphasic errors. An MRI of the brain shows bitemporal hyperintensities. A lumbar puncture is done; cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows an erythrocyte count of 340/mm3 , a leukocyte count of 121/mm3 (88% monocytes), and a protein concentration of 78 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A: Migraine with aura
B: Bacterial meningitis
C: Epstein-Barr virus encephalitis
D: Herpes simplex encephalitis
E: Influenza encephalopathy
F: Dextromethorphan intoxication
G: Viral meningitis
H: HIV encephalopathy
I: Lyme disease
J: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis

Okay, so I've got this medical question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading through the case carefully.

The patient is a 22-year-old college student who was brought to the ER by her parents. They saw her having a seizure about 20 minutes ago. After the seizure, she was confused and had trouble thinking of some words. She's had a headache, cough, and fever for three days, which she treated with acetaminophen and dextromethorphan. Her temperature is 38.9°C, which is 102°F—so that's a high fever.

On neurologic exam, she has diffuse hyperreflexia. Mentally, she's confused with short-term memory deficits. She struggles to name objects and makes literal paraphasic errors. The MRI shows bitemporal hyperintensities. A lumbar puncture was done, and the CSF analysis shows 340 erythrocytes/mm³, 121 leukocytes/mm³ (88% monocytes), and a protein concentration of 78 mg/dL.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. First, the presentation: a young, previously healthy person with a seizure, confusion, language issues, fever, and other symptoms. The MRI is showing bitemporal hyperintensities, which I remember is often seen in conditions affecting the temporal lobes, like herpes encephalitis or maybe some other infections. 

Looking at the CSF results: the erythrocyte count is 340, which is elevated. Usually, a CSF with red blood cells can indicate a traumatic tap, but the count is a bit high, so maybe it's a sign of something else. The leukocyte count is 121, mostly monocytes. That's interesting because in bacterial meningitis, you'd expect more neutrophils. Viral meningitis typically has a lower WBC count, usually under 100, but this is 121, which is a bit higher. The protein is 78 mg/dL, which is elevated. Normal is usually around 15-45, so that's definitely up.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Migraine with aura. Migraines can cause confusion and sometimes even seizures, but they usually don't present with hyperintensities on MRI or such high CSF protein. Plus, the CSF findings don't support this.

B: Bacterial meningitis. That's a possibility, but the CSF WBC count here is 121, which is a bit low for bacterial meningitis, which often has thousands. Also, the high percentage of monocytes is more viral, I think. Plus, the fever is high, but the CSF doesn't have the typical neutrophilic response.

C: Epstein-Barr virus encephalitis. EBV can cause encephalitis, but I'm not sure about the typical presentations. It might cause more of a mononucleosis-like picture, but I'm not certain if it's associated with bitemporal hyperintensities.

D: Herpes simplex encephalitis. This is a strong possibility. HSE often affects the temporal lobes and can present with seizures, confusion, and language issues. The MRI findings align with this. The CSF usually shows a lymphocytic pleocytosis, which is what we have here—monocytes are a type of lymphocyte. The protein is elevated, which is typical in viral encephalitis. Also, HSE can cause a high fever, which fits.

E: Influenza encephalopathy. Influenza can cause neurologic complications, but I'm not sure how common it is. The presentation here seems more specific to a localized encephalitis, like HSE.

F: Dextromethorphan intoxication. That's a possibility, but the patient was using it for 3 days, and dextromethorphan toxicity typically causes more of a hyperstimulation or psychedelic effects, maybe confusion, but seizures are less common. Also, the MRI findings don't point to intoxication.

G: Viral meningitis. Viral meningitis usually presents with meningeal symptoms—neck stiffness, photophobia—and CSF findings are typically lymphocytic with mild elevation. But the patient's symptoms here are more severe, with a seizure and significant MRI changes, which might be more indicative of encephalitis rather than just meningitis.

H: HIV encephalopathy. That's a possibility, but the patient doesn't have a history of HIV, and the acute presentation with fever doesn't fit as well. Plus, the CSF findings don't suggest a chronic infection like HIV.

I: Lyme disease. Lyme can cause neurologic issues, but it usually has a history of tick exposure and a rash. The MRI findings don't align with Lyme, and the CSF would typically show a different pattern, maybe more neutrophils.

J: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. ADEM is a demyelinating condition, often post-infectious. It can cause encephalopathy and seizures, but the MRI would typically show more white matter lesions, whereas bitemporal hyperintensities are more in line with temporal lobe involvement, like HSE.

Putting it all together: The patient's symptoms, MRI, and CSF results all point towards herpes simplex encephalitis. The high fever, confusion, language issues, and MRI showing bitemporal hyperintensities are classic for HSE. The CSF has a lymphocytic pleocytosis (monocytes are a type of lymphocyte), elevated protein, and a mild RBC count, which is consistent with a viral encephalitis process.

The patient presents with a high fever, confusion, language deficits, and bitemporal hyperintensities on MRI, consistent with herpes simplex encephalitis. The CSF analysis shows a lymphocytic pleocytosis (monocytes are a type of lymphocyte), elevated protein, and mild erythrocyte count, aligning with a viral encephalitis. Herpes simplex encephalitis is the most likely diagnosis.
