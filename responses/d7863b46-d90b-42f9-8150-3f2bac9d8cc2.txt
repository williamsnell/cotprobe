Okay, so I've got this fluid mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the velocity components for a given potential function in an irrotational flow.

Alright, the potential function is given as ϕ = x² - y². I remember that in fluid dynamics, the velocity components of an irrotational flow can be found by taking the gradient of the potential function. So, the velocity vector V is the gradient of ϕ.

Gradient in three dimensions usually has partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z. So, the velocity components Vx, Vy, and Vz should be the partial derivatives of ϕ with respect to x, y, and z respectively.

Let me write that down to be clear. The gradient operator is (∂/∂x, ∂/∂y, ∂/∂z), and when I apply it to ϕ, each component will be:

Vx = ∂ϕ/∂x
Vy = ∂ϕ/∂y
Vz = ∂ϕ/∂z

So let's compute each of these.

First, Vx is the derivative of ϕ with respect to x. ϕ is x² - y², so the derivative of x² with respect to x is 2x. The derivative of -y² with respect to x is zero because it's treated as a constant when taking the derivative with respect to x. So Vx should be 2x.

Next, Vy is the partial derivative of ϕ with respect to y. The derivative of x² with respect to y is zero, and the derivative of -y² with respect to y is -2y. So Vy is -2y.

Now, Vz is the partial derivative of ϕ with respect to z. But looking at ϕ, it's only a function of x and y, not z. So the derivative of ϕ with respect to z is zero. Hence, Vz is 0.

Putting it all together, the velocity components are:
Vx = 2x
Vy = -2y
Vz = 0

Looking at the options, I need to find which one matches this. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Vx=2x², Vy=-2y², Vz=0. No, because our Vx is 2x, not 2x².

Option B: Vx=2y, Vy=-2x, Vz=0. No, that's swapping x and y in a way that doesn't match our results.

Option C: Vx=2x, Vy=-2y, Vz=0. Yes, this matches exactly what I found.

Option D: All components are x, y, z. No, doesn't match.

Option E: All zeros. No, because Vx and Vy are not zero.

Option F: All components are 2x, 2y, 2z. No, Vz shouldn't be 2z, and Vy is -2y, not positive.

Option G: Vx=x², Vy=-y², Vz=2z. No, Vx and Vy are not squared terms, and Vz isn't present in ϕ.

Option H: Vx=-2x, Vy=2y, Vz=-z. Opposite signs for Vx and Vy, but our results are positive 2x and negative 2y. So this is incorrect.

Option I: Vx=2x, Vy=-2y, Vz=z. Close, but Vz should be zero, not z.

Option J: Vx=x, Vy=-y, Vz=0. The coefficients are 1 instead of 2, so no.

So the correct option is C.
</think>

The velocity components are found by taking the gradient of the potential function ϕ = x² - y². 

- Vx = ∂ϕ/∂x = 2x  
- Vy = ∂ϕ/∂y = -2y  
- Vz = ∂ϕ/∂z = 0  

These match option C.  

Answer: C
