Okay, so I've got this problem here about probability density functions. Let's see what it's asking. The function given is g(x) = (1 + x²)^-1. I need to find a constant k such that f(x) = k(1 + x²)^-1 is a proper probability density function (pdf) over the entire real line, from negative infinity to positive infinity. Then, I have to find F(x), which is the cumulative distribution function (CDF), Pr(X ≤ x).

First, I remember that for a function to be a valid pdf, the integral of f(x) over all x must equal 1. So, I need to set up the integral of f(x) from -∞ to ∞ and set it equal to 1 to solve for k.

So f(x) = k/(1 + x²). The integral of f(x) dx from -∞ to ∞ should be 1. Let's write that out:

∫_{-∞}^{∞} [k / (1 + x²)] dx = 1

I know that the integral of 1/(1 + x²) dx from -∞ to ∞ is a standard integral. The antiderivative of 1/(1 + x²) is arctan(x), right? So evaluating from -∞ to ∞, arctan(∞) is π/2 and arctan(-∞) is -π/2. So the integral becomes (π/2) - (-π/2) = π.

So, ∫ [1/(1 + x²)] dx from -∞ to ∞ = π.

Therefore, substituting back into the equation:

k * π = 1

So, solving for k, k = 1/π.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that. The integral of 1/(1 + x²) is indeed arctan(x), and over the entire real line, that's π. So yes, k must be 1/π to make the integral equal to 1. So f(x) = (1/π)(1 + x²)^-1 is a valid pdf.

Now, the next part is to find F(x), the CDF, which is Pr(X ≤ x). That means I need to compute the integral of f(t) from -∞ to x.

So, F(x) = ∫_{-∞}^{x} [1/(π(1 + t²))] dt

Again, the integral of 1/(1 + t²) dt is arctan(t). So,

F(x) = (1/π) * [arctan(t)] from -∞ to x

Evaluating that, arctan(x) - arctan(-∞). Arctan(-∞) is -π/2, so:

F(x) = (1/π) [ arctan(x) - (-π/2) ] = (1/π)(arctan(x) + π/2 )

Simplify that:

F(x) = (1/π) arctan(x) + (1/π)(π/2) = (1/π) arctan(x) + 1/2

Wait, that doesn't look right. Let me check again. Because when I subtract, it's [arctan(x) - (-π/2)] which is arctan(x) + π/2. Then, multiplied by 1/π, so it's (arctan(x) + π/2)/π = arctan(x)/π + (π/2)/π = arctan(x)/π + 1/2.

Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake because when integrating from -infty to x, the lower limit is arctan(-infty) which is -π/2. So the integral becomes [arctan(x) - (-π/2)] = arctan(x) + π/2. So when multiplied by 1/π, it's (arctan(x) + π/2)/π = arctan(x)/π + 1/2.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's the correct expression. Let me think again. Because arctan(x) approaches π/2 as x approaches infinity and -π/2 as x approaches negative infinity.

So, F(x) = (1/π)(arctan(x) + π/2). Let me factor that:

F(x) = (1/π) arctan(x) + (π/2)(1/π) = (1/π) arctan(x) + 1/2.

Alternatively, sometimes the CDF is written as F(x) = (2/π) arctan(x) + 1/2? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, maybe I'm confusing it with another distribution.

Wait, let me recast the integral. The integral of 1/(1 + t²) from -infty to x is arctan(x) + π/2? Wait no, because when t approaches -infty, arctan(t) approaches -π/2. So the integral from -infty to x is arctan(x) - (-π/2) = arctan(x) + π/2. So the integral of 1/(1 + t²) from -infty to x is arctan(x) + π/2. Therefore, F(x) is that multiplied by 1/π, so (arctan(x) + π/2)/π.

Which simplifies to (arctan(x)/π) + (π/(2π)) = arctan(x)/π + 1/2. So yes, that seems correct.

Wait, but another way to write this is F(x) = (2/π) arctan(x) + 1/2? No, because the integral from -infty to x of 1/(1 + t²) dt is arctan(x) + π/2, so when we multiply by 1/π, it's (arctan(x) + π/2)/π = arctan(x)/π + 1/2.

Alternatively, perhaps it's written as (2/π) arctan(x) + 1/2? Wait, no, because that would only be the case if the integral from 0 to x, but in this case, we're integrating from -infty.

Wait, maybe I should check the standard result. The integral from -infty to x of 1/(1 + t²) dt is arctan(x) + π/2. So yes, that's correct. So F(x) is (arctan(x) + π/2)/π = arctan(x)/π + 1/2.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me compute it again carefully.

The integral of 1/(1 + t²) dt from a to b is arctan(b) - arctan(a). So, when a is -infty, arctan(-infty) is -π/2. So the integral from -infty to x is arctan(x) - (-π/2) = arctan(x) + π/2.

Therefore, F(x) = (1/π)(arctan(x) + π/2) = (arctan(x))/π + (π/2)/π = (arctan(x))/π + 1/2.

So that's correct. So F(x) = (1/π) arctan(x) + 1/2.

Wait, but looking at the options given, I don't see this exact expression. The options are A to J, and the options are constants, not functions. Wait, wait no, the question says "Find F(x) = Pr(X ≤ x)". So F(x) is a function, but the options are all constants. Hmm, that can't be. Wait no, looking back at the question, the options are A: π, B:3/π, etc., up to J:1/2. So the options are constants, not functions. But F(x) is a function. So perhaps the question is asking for F(x), but the options are just the possible forms, but they are written as constants. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question says: "Determine a constant k... is a proper probability density... Find F(x) = Pr(X ≤ x) if X is distributed with density function f(x)."

So F(x) is the CDF, which is a function, but the options are all constants. That suggests that perhaps the question is not asking for F(x) as a function, but perhaps a specific value, or maybe the question is miswritten. Alternatively, perhaps I misread it.

Wait, looking again: the options are A: π, B:3/π, etc., up to J:1/2. So the options are constants, which suggests that perhaps the question is asking for the value of k. Because k is a constant. Wait, but the first part is to determine k, and then find F(x). So perhaps the options are for k, but the question lists the options as for the entire question.

Wait, the question says: "Determine a constant k... Find F(x) = Pr(X ≤ x)...". So perhaps the options are for k, but the way the question is phrased, it's a two-part question. But in the options, they're all constants, which suggests that the question is perhaps only asking for k, but perhaps the user intended to ask for F(x) as a function, but the options are constants.

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the question. But given the options are constants, perhaps the question is only about finding k, and the mention of F(x) is a red herring. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the question is correctly written, and the options are for F(x), but F(x) is a function. However, the options are constants, so perhaps the intended answer is the value of F(x) at a particular point, but the question doesn't specify that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me go back. The first part is to find k so that f(x) is a valid pdf. We determined k = 1/π. So that's the value of k. Now, the second part is to find F(x), which is the CDF, which we found as (1/π) arctan(x) + 1/2.

But the options are all constants, so perhaps the question is only about k, and the mention of F(x) is a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is k, and the options are for k.

Looking at the options, option I is 1/π, which matches what we found for k. So perhaps the answer is I.

Wait, but the question says to determine k, then find F(x). But the options are all constants, so perhaps the intended answer is k, which is 1/π, option I.

But the way the question is written, it says "Find F(x) = Pr(X ≤ x)", which is a function, but the options are constants, so perhaps the user made a mistake in the options, or perhaps the question is only about k. Alternatively, perhaps F(x) can be expressed in terms of an option, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the user intended to ask for k, and the options are for k. So the answer would be I: 1/π.

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for F(x) evaluated at a particular point, but the question doesn't specify. But given the options, I think the intended answer is k, which is 1/π, option I.

To determine the constant \( k \) such that \( f(x) = k(1 + x^2)^{-1} \) is a proper probability density function (pdf), we require that the integral of \( f(x) \) over the entire real line equals 1. 

\[
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{k}{1 + x^2} \, dx = 1
\]

The integral of \( \frac{1}{1 + x^2} \) from \( -\infty \) to \( \infty \) is a standard result and equals \( \pi \). Therefore:

\[
k \cdot \pi = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad k = \frac{1}{\pi}
\]

Thus, the constant \( k \) is \( \frac{1}{\pi} \), which corresponds to option I.
