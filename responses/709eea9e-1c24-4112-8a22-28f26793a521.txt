F: Rich countries will have low growth rates
G: Poor countries will have high growth rates
H: High levels of savings will always lead to high growth rates

Okay, so I have this economics question about the Harrod-Domar model and Keynesian theory of savings, and how they imply growth rates for poor countries. Hmm, I remember that the Harrod-Domar model is related to economic growth, especially focusing on the rate of capital accumulation. Let me think.

The Harrod-Domar model suggests that the growth rate of an economy depends on the savings rate and the productivity of capital. The formula I think is something like growth rate (g) equals savings rate (s) divided by the depreciation rate plus the productivity of capital. So g = s / (δ + a), where 'a' is the productivity. 

Now, Keynesian theory of savings comes into play here. Keynesians believe that savings depend on the level of income. So as people's income increases, their savings also tend to increase, but at a lower rate than income. This is the idea of the marginal propensity to save.

Putting these together, the Harrod-Domar model, when combined with Keynesian savings, implies that higher savings rates can lead to higher growth rates. But wait, how does this apply to poor countries?

Poor countries usually have lower income levels. If savings are a function of income, then poor countries might have lower savings rates because people are saving a smaller portion of their lower incomes. But wait, no, actually, in some cases, poor countries might have higher savings rates because the marginal propensity to save could be higher. Or perhaps not, because they might not have the means to save much.

Wait, the Harrod-Domar model says that growth is determined by savings and the productivity of capital. If poor countries have lower savings rates, then according to the model, their growth rates would be lower. Because g = s/(δ + a). So lower s would mean lower g.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. In the Harrod-Domar model, the equilibrium growth rate is determined by the savings rate and the capital-output ratio. The capital-output ratio is 1/a, where a is productivity. So if a is high, the required capital per unit of output is lower, which would mean higher growth for the same savings rate.

Now, considering poor countries: they might have lower productivity (a is lower), which would mean the denominator in g = s/(δ + a) is higher, leading to lower growth rates. Also, their savings rates (s) might be lower because their income is lower, and perhaps the marginal propensity to save is lower too, or they save more out of necessity.

So combining these factors, poor countries would have lower savings rates and possibly lower productivity, both leading to lower growth rates. That would mean the growth rates are lower for poor countries, perhaps making option I correct: "Poor countries will have low growth rates."

Looking at the options:

Option I: Poor countries will have low growth rates.

Option G: Poor countries will have high growth rates. That seems opposite.

Option H: High savings always lead to high growth. But if a country has low productivity, high savings might not help much.

Option J: Poor countries can achieve high growth regardless of investment. That doesn't sound right because investment (savings) is a key factor in the model.

So the model implies that poor countries have lower savings rates and perhaps lower productivity, leading to lower growth. So the answer should be I.

The Harrod-Domar model, combined with the Keynesian theory of savings, suggests that poor countries tend to have lower growth rates due to their lower savings rates and possibly lower productivity. This implies that poor countries will have low growth rates.
