Okay, so I need to figure out who the founder of Sikhism is. I remember that Sikhism is a religion that originated in the Punjab region of South Asia. The founder is one of the Gurus from the list provided. Let me go through each option and see which one makes sense.

Looking at the options, I know that Guru Nanak is a significant figure. I think he was the first Guru. Let me recall: I believe the first Guru is indeed Guru Nanak. He started the Sikh tradition in the 15th century. The other Gurus came after him, building on his teachings. For example, Guru Gobind Singh was the tenth Guru and compiled the Adi Granth, the holy book of Sikhs. But since the question is about the founder, it's the first one.

So the answer should be E: Guru Nanak.

The founder of Sikhism is Guru Nanak, the first of the ten Gurus.
