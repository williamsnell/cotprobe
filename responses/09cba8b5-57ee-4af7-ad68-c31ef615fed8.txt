Okay, so I have this problem where I need to calculate the Hamming pairwise distances among three codewords: 00000, 10101, and 01010. Then, I have to find the minimum Hamming distance among them. Hmm, I remember that the Hamming distance is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different. So for each pair of codewords, I need to compare each bit and count the differences.

First, let me list the codewords again to make sure I have them right:
- Codeword A: 00000
- Codeword B: 10101
- Codeword C: 01010

I need to calculate the Hamming distance between each pair: A and B, A and C, and B and C. Then, among those three distances, I'll find the smallest one, which is the minimum Hamming distance.

Let me start with the first pair: A (00000) and B (10101).

Comparing each bit position:
1. Position 1: 0 vs 1 → different. Count 1.
2. Position 2: 0 vs 0 → same. No count.
3. Position 3: 0 vs 1 → different. Count 2.
4. Position 4: 0 vs 0 → same. No count.
5. Position 5: 0 vs 1 → different. Count 3.

So the Hamming distance between A and B is 3. That's one of the options, option A:3.

Next, comparing A (00000) and C (01010):

Position by position:
1. 0 vs 0 → same. No count.
2. 0 vs 1 → different. Count 1.
3. 0 vs 0 → same. No count.
4. 0 vs 1 → different. Count 2.
5. 0 vs 0 → same. No count.

So the Hamming distance between A and C is 2. That's option J:2. Hmm, that's smaller than the previous one.

Now, the last pair: B (10101) and C (01010).

Let me go through each position:
1. 1 vs 0 → different. Count 1.
2. 0 vs 1 → different. Count 2.
3. 1 vs 0 → different. Count 3.
4. 0 vs 1 → different. Count 4.
5. 1 vs 0 → different. Count 5.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me check again. Oh wait, I think I made a mistake because B is 10101 and C is 01010.

Let me write them down:

B: 1 0 1 0 1
C: 0 1 0 1 0

Comparing each position:
1. 1 vs 0 → different. Count 1.
2. 0 vs 1 → different. Count 2.
3. 1 vs 0 → different. Count 3.
4. 0 vs 1 → different. Count 4.
5. 1 vs 0 → different. Count 5.

Wait, that's 5 differences. So the Hamming distance between B and C is 5. That's option I:5.

Now, the three distances are:
- A-B:3
- A-C:2
- B-C:5

The minimum among these is 2. So the answer should be option J:2.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.

For A and C: 00000 vs 01010.

Positions:
1: 0 vs 0 → same.
2: 0 vs1 → different.
3:0 vs0 → same.
4:0 vs1 → different.
5:0 vs0 → same.

Yes, that's 2 differences. So the Hamming distance is 2.

Between B and C: 10101 vs 01010.

Each position:
1:1 vs0 → different.
2:0 vs1 → different.
3:1 vs0 → different.
4:0 vs1 → different.
5:1 vs0 → different.

That's 5 differences, so distance 5.

So the minimum is indeed 2, which is the smallest among the three distances. So the answer is J:2.
</think>

The Hamming distances between the given codewords are calculated as follows:

- Between 00000 and 10101: 3 differences → distance 3.
- Between 00000 and 01010: 2 differences → distance 2.
- Between 10101 and 01010: 5 differences → distance 5.

The minimum Hamming distance is 2.
