Question:

Formation of a solution can often be visualized as a three-step process. Step 1. Solvent molecules are separated from each other to make space for the solute. Step 2. Solute molecules are separated so they fit into spaces in the solvent. Step 3. Separated solute and solvent are brought together, filling in the spaces. Which of the following statements about the energy involved in the above is correct?

Options:

A: Step 1 is endothermic, steps 2 and 3 are exothermic.
B: All three steps are endothermic.
C: Steps 1 and 3 are exothermic, and step 2 is endothermic.
D: All three steps are exothermic.
E: Steps 1 and 3 are endothermic, and step 2 is exothermic.
F: Step 1 is exothermic, steps 2 and 3 are endothermic.
G: Step 3 is exothermic, steps 1 and 2 are neither exothermic nor endothermic.
H: Step 1 and 2 are exothermic, step 3 is neither exothermic nor endothermic.
I: Steps 1 and 2 are exothermic, and step 3 is endothermic.
J: Steps 1 and 2 are endothermic, and step 3 is exothermic.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the energy changes involved in the formation of a solution through a three-step process. Hmm, I need to figure out which statement about the energy is correct. Let me think through each step carefully.

The question describes the process in three steps:

1. Solvent molecules separate to make space for the solute.
2. Solute molecules separate to fit into the solvent's spaces.
3. The separated solute and solvent come together, filling the spaces.

Each of these steps involves energy changes, either endothermic or exothermic. I remember that endothermic processes absorb heat, while exothermic ones release heat.

Let me break down each step. 

Step 1: Solvent molecules are separated. Separating molecules usually requires energy because you're breaking the intermolecular forces. So this step should be endothermic. For example, when water molecules separate, energy is absorbed because you're disrupting hydrogen bonds.

Step 2: Solute molecules separate. Similar to step one, breaking apart solute molecules into individual ions or molecules also requires energy. So step two is also endothermic. Like dissolving salt where the ions separate, which takes energy.

Step 3: The solute and solvent come together. Now, when they combine, they form new interactionsâ€”like solute-solvent interactions. This process releases energy because the molecules are forming bonds. So step three is exothermic. Think of when you mix ethanol and water; they form hydrogen bonds, releasing energy.

Wait, but sometimes when something dissolves, it might feel cold or hot. For example, dissolving NaOH in water is exothermic because the energy released when the ions and water molecules interact is more than the energy used to break them apart. But in the overall process, each step has its own energy change.

So putting it together: steps 1 and 2 are endothermic because they involve breaking apart molecules, and step 3 is exothermic because new interactions form, releasing energy.

Looking at the options, which one matches this? Let's see each option.

Option J says steps 1 and 2 are endothermic, step 3 is exothermic. That fits what I thought.

Wait, but I should double-check. Are all the steps accurately described? 

Yes, because step 1 is solvent separation (endothermic), step 2 is solute separation (endothermic), and step 3 is their combination (exothermic). So the correct option should be J.

The process of forming a solution involves three steps, each with distinct energy changes. Step 1 and Step 2 require energy as molecules are separated, making them endothermic. Step 3 releases energy as solute and solvent molecules form new interactions, making it exothermic. Therefore, the correct answer is:

J

The answer is J.
