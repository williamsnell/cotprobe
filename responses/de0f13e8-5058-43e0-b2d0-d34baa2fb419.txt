Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this electric dipole question. Alright, let's see. The problem says we have an electric dipole consisting of two equal but opposite point charges, each 4.0 nC, separated by 2.0 cm. We need to find the electric field strength at the midpoint between them. Hmm, okay.

Wait, I remember that an electric dipole has two charges, positive and negative, equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, separated by some distance. The electric field at the midpoint might be zero because of symmetry, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

So, each charge is 4.0 nC. Wait, nC is nanocoulombs, right? So that's 4.0 x 10^-9 C. The separation is 2.0 cm, which is 0.02 meters. The midpoint is exactly halfway, so each charge is 1.0 cm or 0.01 m away from the midpoint.

Now, the electric field due to a point charge is given by E = kQ / r², where k is Coulomb's constant, about 8.99 x 10^9 N·m²/C². But since there are two charges, I need to calculate each's contribution and see if they add or subtract.

Wait, but the charges are opposite. So the positive charge would create an electric field pointing away from it, and the negative charge would create a field pointing towards it. At the midpoint, where would each field point?

Let me visualize this. Suppose the positive charge is on the left and the negative on the right. At the midpoint between them, the positive charge's field would point to the right (since it's positive, fields radiate outward), and the negative charge's field would also point to the left (because field lines go into negatives). Wait, wait, no. Wait, no, that can't be right. If you're at the midpoint, the positive charge is to the left, so the field from positive would be to the right (since you're to the right of positive, so field points away). The negative charge is to the right, so the field from negative would be to the left (because field points towards negative). So each field is pointing in opposite directions.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, no. Let me correct that. The positive charge is on the left, so at the midpoint, the field from the positive charge (which is +Q) would point towards the right (since field from positive is away from it, so right). The negative charge is on the right, so the field at midpoint due to negative charge (-Q) would point towards the left (since field lines go into negatives, so from midpoint to the left). So the two fields are in opposite directions. So they would subtract.

Wait no, wait, are they? Wait, if both fields are pointing in opposite directions, then the net field is the difference between the two. But wait, because each charge is the same magnitude, and the distances are the same, the magnitudes would be the same. So if they're in opposite directions, the fields would cancel each other out. So the net electric field at the midpoint would be zero.

Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. So the positive charge's field at midpoint is E1 = k*(4e-9) / (0.01)^2. Similarly, the negative charge's field is E2 = k*(4e-9) / (0.01)^2. But because the charges are opposite, E1 and E2 point in opposite directions. So E_net = E1 - E2, but since they're same magnitude, E_net would be zero.

Wait, but that's only if the charges are equal and opposite. So yes, in this case, the fields would cancel each other. So the electric field at the midpoint is zero. So looking at the options, option J is 0. So the answer should be J.

The electric dipole consists of two equal but opposite charges, each of magnitude 4.0 nC, separated by 2.0 cm. The midpoint between the charges is equidistant (1.0 cm) from both charges. The electric field due to a point charge is given by \( E = \frac{kQ}{r^2} \), where \( k \) is Coulomb's constant, \( Q \) is the charge, and \( r \) is the distance from the charge.

At the midpoint, the positive charge creates an electric field pointing to the right, while the negative charge creates an electric field pointing to the left. Since the charges are equal in magnitude and the distances are the same, the magnitudes of the fields are identical. However, because the fields are in opposite directions, they cancel each other out. Therefore, the net electric field at the midpoint is zero.
