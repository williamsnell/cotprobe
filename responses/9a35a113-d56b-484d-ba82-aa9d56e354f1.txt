Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about auditing, specifically regarding the granting of stock options to senior management. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking what the auditor is most likely to do when performing substantive tests related to stock options. The options are A through J, each describing a different auditing procedure.

First, I need to recall what substantive tests are. From what I remember, substantive testing involves checking the accuracy, completeness, and validity of financial statements. The auditor is looking for errors or fraud that could affect the financials. So in this case, the focus is on stock options granted to senior management, which probably relate to executive compensation and equity.

Looking at the options:

A: Interview senior management to determine their knowledge of stock options. Hmm, that seems more like a general discussion. While interview is a tool, this might be more about understanding processes rather than substantive testing.

B: Confirm with the issuer's legal counsel whether the options were legally granted. That sounds relevant because the auditor would want to ensure that the stock options were indeed granted correctly and in accordance with laws. But is this the most likely step?

C: Review the public records of the SEC to determine whether the options were properly reported. SEC records are public, so the auditor might check if the issuer has disclosed the stock options properly. But is this the primary step or more of a confirmatory measure?

D: Trace the authorization for the options granted to the board of directors' approval. This seems important because stock options typically require board approval. Tracing authorization would ensure that the right people approved the options, which is a key control.

E: Confirm with those members of management as to whether they are actually option holders. That makes sense. The auditor would want to verify that the options were actually granted to the people listed. But is this the most likely first step or more of a confirmation?

F: Review the issuer's tax records to determine the tax implications of the stock options. Tax implications are important, but I'm not sure if this is the primary focus of the substantive test regarding granting. It might be more about the financial impact rather than the granting process itself.

G: Verify the existence of option holders in the issuer's payroll and human resources records. This sounds like checking if the options are being accounted for correctly in the company's records. Payroll and HR would have records of who has options, so this is a good point. But is this the most likely step an auditor would take first?

H: Review the minutes of the board of directors' meetings to determine if the options were discussed. Similar to option D, this is about checking if the board approved the options. Reviewing minutes would provide written evidence of the decision.

I: Analyze the financial reports to determine the impact of the stock options on the company's profitability. This seems more about the financial statements' outcomes rather than the granting process itself. The impact is important, but maybe not the primary test here.

J: Inspect the company's employee handbook to verify the policy on stock options. This would be about ensuring the company has policies in place, which is more about compliance with internal policies rather than the substantive testing of the transactions.

Now, thinking about what an auditor does in substantive testing for stock options. They need to ensure that the options were properly authorized, recorded, and reported. So, they would likely check the board's approval, which is a key control point. Therefore, options D and H both relate to board approval, but D says to trace authorization to the board's approval, which is more active, while H is about reviewing the minutes. Which is more likely?

I think D is about ensuring that each grant was approved by the board, whereas H is about seeing if the board discussed it. But in practice, auditors often check the minutes for approvals. So maybe H is more about the process, but D is about the actual authorization.

Alternatively, perhaps the auditor would check the board minutes to see if the options were approved. So H might be more about the existence of the approval, whereas D is about tracing each grant back to approval.

Wait, the question is about the granting of stock options, so the auditor would want to ensure that each grant was properly authorized. So, checking the board minutes (H) or tracing authorization (D) makes sense.

But which one is more likely? I think that in audits, they often review the minutes to see if the board discussed and approved the stock options. So H might be the answer. But I'm a bit confused because D is about tracing authorization to approval, which is also a key step.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D because it involves verifying that each option grant was specifically approved by the board. Whereas H is more about whether the board discussed it, which might be more general.

Wait, but the question is about the most likely action. Another angle: substantive testing often includes checking the details, so maybe the auditor would look at the board minutes (H) to see if the options were indeed approved. That makes sense because the minutes are a written record of the board's decisions.

Alternatively, the board's approval is a key control, so the auditor would trace each grant back to the board's approval (D). That's a common audit procedure to ensure that each significant transaction was properly authorized.

I'm a bit torn between D and H. But given that the question is about the granting, the auditor would likely review the board's minutes to confirm that the options were discussed and approved. So H is more about the process, while D is about the specific authorization.

Wait, the wording of D is "Trace the authorization for the options granted to the board of directors' approval." That sounds like following each grant back to the board's approval, which would involve checking the minutes as part of that process. So perhaps D is the correct answer because it's about ensuring each grant was approved by the board.

Alternatively, maybe H is about looking for discussion, not necessarily approval. So the auditor might check both the minutes and the authorization process.

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: when performing substantive testing, the auditor might look for evidence of board approval, which could involve reviewing the minutes (H) or getting a written confirmation from the board secretary (which isn't an option here). So between D and H, I think H is about the existence of the board's discussion and approval, while D is about the process of authorization.

Wait, the options are:

D: Trace the authorization for the options granted to the board of directors' approval.

H: Review the minutes of the board of directors' meetings to determine if the options were discussed.

So D is about the process of authorization, ensuring that each grant was approved. H is about checking the minutes for discussion. Which is more likely part of substantive testing regarding granting?

I think D is more about the control process, ensuring that each grant was properly authorized, which is a key part of substantive testing. So the auditor would trace each grant back to the board's approval. Therefore, D is the answer.

The auditor is most likely to trace the authorization for the options granted to the board of directors' approval to ensure that each grant was properly authorized, as this is a key control point in substantive testing.

**Answer: D**
