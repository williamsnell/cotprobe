B: (∀x)[(Bx • Ny) ⊃ Lxy]
C: (∀x)(∃y)[(Bx • Ny) ⊃ Lxy]
D: (∃x)(∀y)[(Bx • Ny) ⊃ Lxy]
E: (∀x)(∃y)[(Bx ⊃ Ny) • Lxy]
F: (∀x)[(∃y)(Bx • Ny) ⊃ Lxy]
G: (∀x)(∀y)[(Bx • Ny) ⊃ Lxy]
H: (∀x)[(∃y)(Ny • Bx) ⊃ Lxy]
I: (∀x)[Bx ⊃ (∃y)(Ny • Lxy)]

Okay, so I've got this logic problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to predicate logic, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about translating the English sentence "All birds live in some nest." I need to choose the correct predicate logic translation from options A to J.

First, let me break down the sentence. The subject is "all birds," which suggests a universal quantifier, probably using ∀x. The predicate is about living in some nest. So I need to represent that each bird (x) lives in some nest (y).

Looking at the predicates given: Bx means x is a bird, Nx means x is a nest, and Lxy means x lives in y.

The original sentence is a universal statement: every bird has some nest it lives in. So in predicate logic, this should involve a universal quantifier for the birds and an existential quantifier for the nests. Because each bird individually has at least one nest, not that there's a single nest for all birds.

Let me consider the structure. For every bird x, there exists a nest y such that x lives in y. So symbolically, that would be ∀x (Bx → ∃y (Ny ∧ Lxy)). 

Wait, let me make sure. The implication is that if x is a bird, then there exists a y that is a nest and x lives in y. So the structure is ∀x [Bx → (∃y)(Ny ∧ Lxy)].

Looking at the options now:

Option A: (∃x)[Bx ⊃ (∃y)(Ny • Lxy)] — This uses an existential quantifier for x, which would mean "There exists a bird such that it lives in some nest." That's not correct because the original statement is about all birds, not just some.

Option I: (∀x)[Bx ⊃ (∃y)(Ny • Lxy)] — This looks right. It says for all x, if x is a bird, then there exists a y where y is a nest and x lives in y. That matches the original statement.

Wait, let me check other options to be thorough.

Option E: (∀x)(∃y)[(Bx ⊃ Ny) • Lxy] — This seems to say that for each bird x, there's a y where either x is a bird implying y is a nest, and x lives in y. But (Bx ⊃ Ny) doesn't make sense because Bx is about x being a bird, Ny is about y being a nest. It should be Lxy, which is about x living in y. So this option is incorrect.

Option F: (∀x)[(∃y)(Bx • Ny) ⊃ Lxy] — This says for all x, if there exists a y such that x is a bird and y is a nest, then x lives in y. Wait, but x is a bird, and y is a nest, so that would mean that if x is a bird and y is a nest, then x lives in y. But the original statement is that each bird has some nest, not that every bird and every nest implies living in it. So this might not capture the correct meaning.

Option I seems better because it correctly uses the implication that being a bird leads to existing a nest that the bird lives in.

Another check: Option I is ∀x (Bx → ∃y (Ny ∧ Lxy)), which is exactly the correct translation. So the answer should be I.

The correct translation is ∀x (Bx → ∃y (Ny ∧ Lxy)), which corresponds to option I.

Answer: I
