Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a household lightbulb being a blackbody radiator. The question is asking what temperature is needed so that the wavelength of maximum emission, lambda_max, is 550 nm. The options are A to D, each giving a temperature in Kelvin.

Hmm, I remember that blackbody radiation has something to do with the peak wavelength emitted depending on the temperature. Oh right, there's this law called Wien's Law. Let me think, I think it's lambda_max multiplied by temperature equals a constant. Wait, what's the constant again? Oh yeah, it's Wien's displacement constant, which I think is approximately 2.898 × 10^-3 m·K. 

So the formula should be lambda_max * T = constant. Rearranging that, T = constant / lambda_max. Let me write that down to make it clearer. So T equals (2.898e-3 m·K) divided by lambda_max in meters.

The given lambda_max is 550 nm. Wait, I need to convert that into meters because the constant is in meters. 1 nm is 1e-9 meters, so 550 nm is 550e-9 meters, which is 5.5e-7 meters. 

Plugging that into the formula: T = (2.898e-3) / (5.5e-7). Let me calculate that. 

Wait, let's do the division step by step. 2.898e-3 divided by 5.5e-7. That's the same as (2.898 / 5.5) multiplied by 1e4, because dividing by 1e-7 is multiplying by 1e7, but wait 2.898e-3 is 2.898 / 1e3, so overall:

(2.898e-3) / (5.5e-7) = (2.898 / 5.5) * (1e-3 / 1e-7) = approximately (0.527) * (1e4) because 1e-3 /1e-7 is 1e4.

Wait 2.898 divided by 5.5 is roughly 0.527. 0.527 times 1e4 is 5270 K. 

Looking at the options, let's see. Option B is 5300 K, which is very close to 5270. So that should be the correct answer. 

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculation because sometimes I might make a mistake with exponents. Let me compute 2.898e-3 divided by 5.5e-7 more accurately.

2.898e-3 is 0.002898. 5.5e-7 is 0.00000055. So 0.002898 divided by 0.00000055. Let me compute that.

Dividing 0.002898 by 0.00000055: 

0.002898 / 0.00000055 = (2.898 / 5.5) * (1e-3 / 1e-7) )= same as before. 2.898 /5.5 is approximately 0.527, multiplied by 1e4 gives 5270 K. Yep, that seems right.

So the temperature should be approximately 5270 K. The closest option is B: 5300 K. So the answer should be B.

The problem involves determining the temperature of a blackbody radiator (a household lightbulb) that emits maximum radiation at a wavelength of 550 nm. Using Wien's Law, which states \( \lambda_{\text{max}} \cdot T = \text{constant} \) (approximately \( 2.898 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m·K} \)), we calculate the temperature.

Given \( \lambda_{\text{max}} = 550 \, \text{nm} = 550 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} = 5.5 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \), the formula becomes:

\[
T = \frac{2.898 \times 10^{-3}}{5.5 \times 10^{-7}}
\]

Performing the calculation:

\[
T = \frac{0.002898}{0.00000055} \approx 5270 \, \text{K}
\]

The closest option provided is \( 5300 \, \text{K} \), corresponding to option B.
