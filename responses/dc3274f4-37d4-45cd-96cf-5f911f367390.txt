Okay, so I have this problem about finding the binding energy of a helium-4 nucleus. Hmm, I remember from chemistry class that binding energy has something to do with the energy holding the nucleus together. The question gives me the atomic mass of 4He as 4.002603 u. I think I need to compare this to the sum of the masses of its individual protons and neutrons.

Wait, right! The binding energy comes from the mass defect. The mass defect is the difference between the mass of the nucleus and the sum of the masses of the individual nucleons. Once I find that mass defect in atomic mass units (u), I can convert it to energy using Einstein's equation E=mc².

So, first, I need to find the mass of four nucleons. He-4 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. Each proton has a mass of about 1.007276 u, and each neutron is about 1.008665 u. Let me calculate the total mass of the individual nucleons.

Two protons: 2 * 1.007276 = 2.014552 u.
Two neutrons: 2 * 1.008665 = 2.01733 u.
Adding them together: 2.014552 + 2.01733 = 4.031882 u.

Now, the mass of the helium nucleus is 4.002603 u. The mass defect is the sum minus the actual mass: 4.031882 - 4.002603 = 0.029279 u.

Wait a second, that seems right. Now, I need to convert this mass defect into energy. I remember that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So, the energy E is mass defect multiplied by 931.5 MeV/u.

Calculating that: 0.029279 u * 931.5 MeV/u ≈ ?

Let me do the math. 0.029279 * 900 is about 26.3511, but since it's 931.5, it's a bit more. Let me calculate more accurately.

0.029279 * 931.5 = ?

Breaking it down: 0.02 * 931.5 = 18.63.
0.009 * 931.5 = 8.3835.
0.000279 *931.5 ≈ 0.259.

Adding them up: 18.63 +8.3835 =27.0135 +0.259≈27.2725 MeV.

Wait, but wait, the binding energy is usually the total energy, but sometimes it's given per nucleon. No, wait, the question asks for the binding energy of the nucleus, so it's the total.

But wait, another thought: sometimes people might get confused between binding energy and the energy released, but I think the calculation is correct as is.

Wait, looking back, the options are around 24 to 33 MeV. My calculation gives about 27.27 MeV. But wait, let me double-check the mass defect calculation.

Wait, the mass of the helium nucleus is 4.002603, and the sum is 4.031882. So 4.031882 minus 4.002603 is 0.029279 u, correct.

So 0.029279 u *931.5 MeV/u = ?

Let me compute that more accurately. 0.029279 *931.5.

Let me compute 0.029279 * 900 = 26.3511.

0.029279 *31.5 = about 0.923.

So total is 26.3511 + 0.923 ≈27.274 MeV.

Looking at the options, I see option C is 27.5, which is close. But wait, maybe I should carry more decimal places.

Wait, let me compute 0.029279 *931.5 more precisely.

0.029279 *931.5:

First, 0.02 *931.5 = 18.63.

0.009*931.5=8.3835.

0.000279*931.5: let's compute 0.0002 *931.5=0.1863, 0.00007 *931.5≈65.205e-4=0.065205, 0.000009*931.5≈0.0083835.

So adding 0.1863 +0.065205 +0.0083835 ≈0.2598885.

So 0.02 gives 18.63, 0.009 gives 8.3835, 0.000279 gives ~0.25989.

Total is 18.63 +8.3835=26.0135 +0.25989≈26.2734 MeV.

Wait, that's about 26.27 MeV, but earlier I thought it was 27.27. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, no, I think I messed up the breakdown. Let me try another approach.

Compute 0.029279 * 931.5:

Calculate 0.029279 * 900 = 26.3511.

0.029279 *31.5 = ?

Compute 0.029279 *30 = 0.87837.

0.029279 *1.5 = 0.0439185.

So 0.87837 +0.0439185≈0.9222885.

So total is 26.3511 +0.9222885≈27.2734 MeV.

So around 27.27 MeV. The options have C as 27.5, which is close. But wait, perhaps I should use more accurate values for the masses of protons and neutrons. Maybe I approximated too much.

Let me check the exact values. I think the atomic mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u, and the neutron is 1.008664 u.

So two protons: 2 *1.007276 =2.014552 u.

Two neutrons: 2*1.008664=2.017328 u.

Sum: 2.014552 +2.017328 =4.03188 u.

Mass of 4He is 4.002603 u. So mass defect is 4.03188 -4.002603=0.029277 u.

Now, 0.029277 u *931.5 MeV/u = ?

Calculate 0.029277 *931.5.

Let me compute it as 0.029277 *931.5.

Let me compute 0.029277 *900 =26.3493.

0.029277*31.5= ?

0.029277*30 =0.87831.

0.029277*1.5=0.0439155.

So total for 31.5 is 0.87831 +0.0439155=0.9222255.

Adding to 26.3493 gives 26.3493 +0.9222255≈27.2715 MeV.

So about 27.27 MeV. The closest option is C:27.5 or maybe another option, but looking at the options:

Options are A:33.9, B:29.8, C:27.5, D:31.2, E:24.3, F:32.5, G:30.4, H:28.3, I:26.1, J:25.7.

So 27.27 is closest to option C:27.5. Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation mistake, or maybe the binding energy is usually per nucleon, but wait no, the question asks for the nucleus's binding energy.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, the binding energy is reported as the energy released when the nucleus forms, which is the mass defect times c². So that's what I did.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the question expects using the atomic mass, but perhaps I should have used the nuclear mass. Wait, the given is the atomic mass of 4He, which includes electrons. But when calculating binding energy, do I need to adjust for electrons?

Wait, no, because when you calculate the mass of the nucleus, you have to account for electrons. Wait, the way I did it earlier: the sum of protons and neutrons is the mass if they were free. The actual nucleus has a mass, and the difference is the binding energy.

Wait, but in reality, the atomic mass includes electrons. But when calculating the binding energy, you usually compare the mass of the nucleus (without electrons) to the sum of the nucleons. So perhaps the given 4.002603 u is the atomic mass, which includes electrons. Hmm, but the sum of the nucleons is just protons and neutrons. So perhaps I should instead consider the mass of the helium atom minus the mass of the electrons.

Wait, because the sum of the nucleons (protons and neutrons) is compared to the mass of the nucleus. So the atomic mass includes electrons, so I need to subtract the mass of the electrons to get the nucleus's mass.

Wait, this might be where I went wrong earlier.

Let me think again. The correct formula is:

Binding Energy (BE) = (Z * m_proton + N * m_neutron - M_nucleus) * c².

But since M_atomic = M_nucleus + Z * m_electron - binding_energ_electrons (but binding electrons has a small contribution, but perhaps negligible? Or maybe it's better to compute M_nucleus = M_atomic - Z * m_electron).

So, perhaps I should adjust the atomic mass to get the nuclear mass.

Wait, the atomic mass of 4He is 4.002603 u. He has 2 electrons. So the mass of the nucleus would be M_atomic - 2 * m_electron.

m_electron is approximately 0.00054858 u per electron.

So 2 electrons: 2 * 0.00054858 = 0.00109716 u.

So M_nucleus = 4.002603 u - 0.00109716 u = 4.00150584 u.

Now, the sum of the nucleons is 4.03188 u as before.

So the mass defect is 4.03188 - 4.00150584 = 0.03037416 u.

Ah! So earlier, I didn't subtract the electron mass, which is why I had a lower mass defect. So now, the mass defect is 0.03037416 u.

Now, multiply by 931.5 MeV/u: 0.03037416 *931.5 ≈ ?

Let me compute that. 0.03 *931.5=27.945.

0.00037416 *931.5 ≈ 0.348.

So total is approximately 27.945 +0.348≈28.293 MeV.

Hmm, that's around 28.3 MeV. Looking at the options, option H is 28.3.

Wait, so I must have made a mistake earlier by not accounting for the electrons. Because the given atomic mass includes electrons, and the sum of nucleons doesn't include them, so the correct way is to subtract the electrons' mass from the atomic mass to get the nuclear mass.

So the correct mass defect is 0.030374 u, leading to about 28.3 MeV. So the correct answer would be option H:28.3.

Wait, but earlier without subtracting electrons, I got 27.27 MeV, but that was incorrect because the atomic mass includes electrons. So now, with the corrected approach, it's about 28.3 MeV.

So the answer should be H:28.3.

To determine the binding energy of the 4He nucleus, we start by calculating the mass defect, which is the difference between the sum of the individual nucleon masses and the actual nuclear mass. The given atomic mass of 4He is 4.002603 u, which includes the mass of the electrons. To find the nuclear mass, we subtract the mass of the two electrons (2 × 0.00054858 u = 0.00109716 u) from the atomic mass:

\[
M_{\text{nucleus}} = 4.002603 \, \text{u} - 0.00109716 \, \text{u} = 4.00150584 \, \text{u}.
\]

The sum of the masses of the individual nucleons (2 protons and 2 neutrons) is calculated as follows:

\[
M_{\text{protons}} = 2 \times 1.007276 \, \text{u} = 2.014552 \, \text{u},
\]
\[
M_{\text{neutrons}} = 2 \times 1.008665 \, \text{u} = 2.01733 \, \text{u},
\]
\[
M_{\text{total nucleons}} = 2.014552 \, \text{u} + 2.01733 \, \text{u} = 4.031882 \, \text{u}.
\]

The mass defect is then:

\[
\Delta M = M_{\text{total nucleons}} - M_{\text{nucleus}} = 4.031882 \, \text{u} - 4.00150584 \, \text{u} = 0.03037616 \, \text{u}.
\]

Using Einstein's equation \( E = \Delta M \cdot c^2 \) and converting the mass defect to energy using \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \):

\[
E = 0.03037616 \, \text{u} \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/\text{u} \approx 28.3 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Thus, the binding energy of the 4He nucleus is approximately **28.3 MeV**, corresponding to option **H**.
