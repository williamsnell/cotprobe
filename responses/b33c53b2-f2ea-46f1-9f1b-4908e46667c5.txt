Alright, let me try to work through this question step by step. So, the scenario is about a 55-year-old man who's been admitted for abdominal pain. He's a business executive, which might mean he's used to being in control or has a certain level of stress in his job. Now, he's in the hospital, which is a different environment, and his behavior is described as being polite to the physician but berating the nurses and other staff. That's an interesting contrast—polite to the doctor but not so much with the nursing staff.

Then, his family arrives: his wife and two of his three adult children. He makes a comment about the missing child, saying with disgust that the child is and always has been worthless. So, he's being quite harsh towards his own child, which is unexpected and concerning.

The question is asking for the most likely explanation of this behavior from the given psychological defense mechanisms. The options are A through J, each representing a different mechanism. I need to figure out which one fits best.

First, I should probably recall what each of these defense mechanisms means. Let me go through them one by one as I remember:

- **Denial (A):** Refusing to accept reality or facts, often as a way to cope with something too painful.
- **Regression (B):** Going back to an earlier stage of development, like acting childish when stressed.
- **Projective Identification (C):** Projecting one's feelings onto others, who then might act out those feelings, reinforcing the projection.
- **Reaction Formation (D):** Adopting behaviors opposite to one's true feelings, often to hide unacceptable emotions.
- **Displacement (E):** Redirecting emotions from a high-risk target to a safer one, like taking out frustration on someone else.
- **Projection (F):** Attributing one's own unacceptable feelings or thoughts onto someone else.
- **Rationalization (G):** Creating a logical explanation for something to avoid facing the real reason.
- **Splitting (H):** Seeing things or people as all good or all bad, without nuance.
- **Intellectualization (I):** Using excessive reasoning to deal with emotions, often to distance oneself from feelings.
- **Sublimation (J):** Channeling unacceptable impulses into socially acceptable activities.

Now, looking at the patient's behavior. He's polite to the physician but harsh with the nurses. That seems like he's treating the doctor with respect but taking his frustrations out on the nursing staff. That might be displacement—redirecting his anger from the doctor (maybe he's frustrated with his condition or the situation) to the nurses, who he sees as a safer target.

Additionally, he's berating the nurses and staff. Displacement often involves taking out emotions on someone who is less threatening or a different group. The doctor is a figure of authority, perhaps he feels he can't be angry with, so he displaces his anger onto the nurses instead.

Now, regarding his comment about his missing child. He says the child is worthless. That seems harsh, but could this be projection? If he's feeling worthless himself, he might be projecting that onto the child. Or perhaps he's displacing his anger or frustration onto the child, especially if he's upset about the situation in the hospital.

Alternatively, could it be splitting? Splitting is seeing things in extremes, all good or all bad. The patient might be splitting the child, seeing them as completely worthless. But in this case, the behavior towards the staff and the comment about the child might be more about displacement and projection.

Wait, but the question is about the most likely explanation for his behavior overall. His behavior towards the staff and his comment about the child could be two separate things, but perhaps they're connected through a defense mechanism.

Let me think again. Displacement is when someone redirects their feelings from a high-target to a low-target. So, if he's angry at the doctors (maybe because he's in pain or frustrated with his condition), he can't express that anger directly, so he takes it out on the nurses instead.

As for the comment about the child, maybe he's projecting his own feelings of worthlessness or frustration onto the child, making the child the target of his negative emotions.

So, considering both behaviors, the mechanism might be displacement for the nurses and projection for the child. But the question is about his overall behavior, so perhaps the primary mechanism is displacement, as it explains the behavior towards the staff.

Alternatively, could it be projection? If he's feeling bad about himself, he's projecting those feelings onto the child. But in that case, why the behavior towards the nurses?

Another angle: He's berating the nurses, which could be displacement, and the comment about the child might be a form of displacement as well—displacing his anger or frustration onto the child instead of addressing it with the doctor or himself.

Wait, another thought: Reaction formation is when someone adopts the opposite behavior. For example, being overly polite might be a reaction formation if he's actually angry. But in this case, he's polite to the doctor but harsh to others, so maybe not reaction formation.

Splitting might be less likely unless he's viewing the world in extremes, but the question doesn't present that as the main issue.

Rationalization would involve making excuses, which doesn't fit here. Intellectualization is using logic to avoid emotions, which doesn't seem to apply.

So, putting it all together, the most likely explanation is displacement. He's redirecting his frustration or anger from the doctor or his situation onto the nurses, and perhaps also onto his child. But since the question is about his behavior in general, displacement seems like the best fit.
</think>

The patient's behavior can be best explained by **displacement**. He redirects his frustrations and anger, likely stemming from his medical situation or interactions with the physician, onto the nurses and staff, who are less direct threats. Additionally, his harsh comment about his child may reflect further displacement of his negative emotions onto others. Displacement is a defense mechanism where emotions intended for a high-risk target are redirected to a safer one.
