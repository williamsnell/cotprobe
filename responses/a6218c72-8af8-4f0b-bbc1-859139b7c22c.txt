Okay, I have this question about where to find information on the credit rating of retail businesses. The options are A through J. Let me think through each one to figure out the correct answer.

First, the question is asking about an important source of information on credit ratings specifically for retail businesses. So, I'm looking for an organization that provides credit reports or ratings, especially for businesses.

Option A: Equifax, Inc. I know Equifax is one of the major credit bureaus, along with Experian and TransUnion. They do provide credit reports, but I'm not sure if they specialize in business credit ratings or if it's more for individual consumers. I think they do have a business division, but I'm not certain if that's the primary source for retail businesses' credit ratings.

Option B: the National Retail Federation. That sounds like an industry association, maybe more focused on advocacy, research, or events for retailers. I don't recall them being a source for credit ratings, so probably not this one.

Option C: the Small Business Administration (SBA). The SBA is a government agency that helps small businesses, offering loans, training, etc. They might have some financial information, but I don't think they provide credit ratings themselves. More likely, they'd use reports from other agencies.

Option D: the local chamber of commerce. Chambers of commerce are local business networks that might provide some business information, but credit ratings? I don't think so. They might have directories or listings, but not detailed credit reports.

Option E: Moody's Corporation. I know Moody's is a well-known credit rating agency that rates various entities, including companies and governments. They do provide credit ratings, but are they specialized for retail businesses? I think they cover a broad range, including retail, but I'm not sure if they're the primary source for retail businesses' credit info.

Option F: the United States Department of Commerce. This is a government department that collects business data, but I'm not sure they provide credit ratings. They might have economic data or business formation stats, but not individual credit ratings.

Option G: the Retail Merchants Association. Another industry association, probably focused on supporting retailers. They might offer resources or publications, but not specifically credit ratings.

Option H: Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. I remember D&B as a major provider of business credit reports and ratings. They have a long history of providing commercial credit information, including D-U-N-S numbers and credit scores for businesses. This seems like a strong candidate.

Option I: the Better Business Bureau (BBB). The BBB provides consumer reports on businesses, focusing on customer reviews and business practices. They might have some financial info, but I don't think they're a primary source for detailed credit ratings.

Option J: the United States Retail Credit Association. This name suggests it's an association related to retail credit, but I'm not familiar with them providing credit ratings. They might be more of a trade group or association for professionals in retail credit.

So, putting it together: Equifax (A) is a credit bureau but more known for consumer credit. D&B (H) is specialized in business credit reports, which makes them the most likely correct answer. Moody's (E) is a credit rating agency but perhaps more for large companies or specific sectors. The others seem less likely to be the primary source for retail businesses' credit ratings.
