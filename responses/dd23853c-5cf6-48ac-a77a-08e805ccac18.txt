Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A man was arrested and charged with sexually assaulting a child. At trial, in its case-in-chief, the prosecution seeks to introduce evidence that the man had twice been previously involved in similar cases with other children. The prosecution argues that these past crimes demonstrate the likelihood that the man molested this child. Defense counsel objects to the evidence regarding other children. The judge should find the evidence

Options:

A: inadmissible, because the prosecution cannot initiate evidence of bad character.
B: admissible, because the evidence of past crimes is relevant to the case at hand.
C: inadmissible, because the evidence of past crimes is prejudicial and would bias the jury.
D: admissible, because the man's past crimes demonstrate a pattern of behavior.
E: inadmissible, because past crimes may not be introduced to prove disposition to commit certain acts.
F: inadmissible, because the man's past crimes are not similar enough to the current charge.
G: admissible, because a common plan or scheme may be proven by other similar criminal acts.
H: admissible, as long as the evidence of past crimes does not outweigh its probative value.
I: inadmissible, because past crimes are not relevant to the case at hand.
J: admissible, because the man's past crimes may be introduced to show that he is more likely to have committed the crime with which he is charged.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with the admissibility of prior crimes in a criminal trial. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a man who's been charged with sexually assaulting a child. The prosecution wants to introduce evidence that he was previously involved in similar cases with other children. The defense objects, and the judge has to decide if this evidence is admissible.

Alright, so I'm a bit rusty on evidence rules, but I remember that prior crimes can sometimes be used in court, but under specific conditions. Let me think about the rules.

In general, a person's character isn't admissible to prove they acted in a certain way. So, you can't just say, "Well, he's a bad person, so he did it." But there are exceptions. I think one of them is when the prior crimes are so similar that they show a pattern or a modus operandi. Like, if someone has a history of committing similar crimes, it can be relevant to show that they're more likely to have committed the current one.

Wait, but sometimes the rules also require that the prior acts be similar enough and that there's a time period that makes sense. Also, there's the issue of whether the probative value outweighs the prejudicial effect. The evidence shouldn't be so inflammatory that it just makes the jury mad at the defendant without actually helping to prove his guilt.

So, looking at the options:

Option A: Inadmissible because bad character can't be initiated by prosecution. Hmm, but prior crimes can sometimes be admitted for other purposes, so A might not be right.

Option B: Admissible because past crimes are relevant. That sounds possible, but I think it's more about whether they're similar enough and if they show a pattern.

Option C: Inadmissible because prejudicial. While prejudice is a factor, if the evidence is relevant for another purpose, it might still be admissible. So C might not be the correct reason, but it's a consideration.

Option D: Admissible because past crimes show a pattern. This seems closer to what I was thinking earlier about modus operandi.

Option E: Inadmissible because past crimes can't be used to show disposition. Wait, isn't that the general rule? Like, you can't use past crimes to show someone has a bad disposition, but exceptions apply when it's for pattern or plan.

Option F: Inadmissible because not similar enough. The question doesn't specify if the previous cases are similar, just that they're similar. So probably similar enough, but maybe this depends on the facts.

Option G: Admissible because of a common plan or scheme. That's another exceptionâ€”using prior acts to show a plan that includes the current crime. So if the prior acts are part of a larger plan, they can be admitted.

Option H: Admissible as long as probative value outweighs prejudice. This is a general rule, but the question is about the judge's finding, so the focus is on whether the evidence is admissible, not just the balancing test.

Option I: Inadmissible because irrelevant. Well, if the prior acts are similar and show a pattern, they are relevant, so I don't think I is correct.

Option J: Admissible because past crimes make him more likely to have committed the crime. That sounds like the disposition exception, which is generally not allowed unless for specific reasons like pattern.

Wait, so the key here is whether the prior crimes are being used to show a pattern or modus operandi. The Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 404(b), allow evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts if they're not being used to prove the defendant's bad character. Instead, they can be used to show things like motive, opportunity, intent, pattern, etc.

In this case, the prosecution is using the prior similar cases to show that the man is likely to have molested the child because he's done it before. So that's using prior acts to show a pattern or modus operandi, which is a permissible use under Rule 404(b).

So looking back at the options, options D, G, and J touch on this. Option D says it's admissible because past crimes show a pattern of behavior. G says it's for a common plan or scheme. J says it's to show he's more likely to have committed the crime.

Wait, but J sounds like it's using the prior acts to show disposition, which is what the rule against character evidence is meant to prevent. So J might not be correct because it's about disposition unless it's under an exception.

D and G are about pattern or plan. The question says the prosecution argues that the past crimes demonstrate the likelihood, which suggests a pattern. So D seems correct. But G is about a common plan or scheme, which would be another reason. But in this case, the prior acts don't necessarily tie into a single plan or scheme unless each was part of the same plan. It's more about a repeated behavior pattern.

Alternatively, the fact that the prior acts are similar could be used to show a modus operandi, which is a method of operation. That's another way prior acts can be admitted.

So which option aligns with that? Option D says it's admissible because past crimes demonstrate a pattern of behavior. That fits with modus operandi or repeated similar acts.

Option G is about a common plan or scheme, which might not be the case here unless all the prior acts are part of a bigger plan, which isn't indicated in the question.

So I think D is the correct answer. The evidence is admissible because it shows a pattern, making the defendant more likely to have committed the current offense.

The question revolves around the admissibility of evidence regarding the defendant's prior similar crimes in a trial for sexually assaulting a child. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 404(b), prior crimes can be admitted if they are not used to prove bad character but instead to show patterns, modus operandi, or other relevant factors like intent or opportunity. 

The prosecution seeks to introduce the prior acts to establish a pattern of behavior, which is permissible under the rule. While prejudice is a consideration, the evidence's probative value in showing a pattern outweighs any potential bias. Options like D, which focus on the pattern of behavior, align with this reasoning, whereas options like J incorrectly suggest using prior crimes to show disposition, which is generally inadmissible. Therefore, the evidence is admissible because it demonstrates a pattern of behavior.

Answer: D
