Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I have this logic problem to solve. The question is about translating a logical formula into a natural English sentence using the given options. The formula provided is ~C ∨ D. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what ~C ∨ D means. In logic, the symbol ~ stands for negation, and ∨ stands for disjunction, which is like "or." So, ~C ∨ D translates to "either not C or D." 

Looking at the key provided, each letter corresponds to a specific action:
- C: Emily stops working.
- D: Russell makes dinner.

So, ~C would mean "Emily does not stop working." Therefore, the formula ~C ∨ D is saying "If Emily does not stop working, then Russell makes dinner." Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. Actually, in logic, A ∨ B is equivalent to "If not A, then B." So, ~C ∨ D can be rewritten as "If C is not true (Emily does not stop working), then D must be true (Russell makes dinner)." Alternatively, it's the same as saying "If Emily stops working, then Russell makes dinner." Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here. Wait, no. Let me approach it differently.

In logic, the statement ~C ∨ D can be expressed using implication as C → D. Because in logic, A ∨ B is equivalent to ~A → B. So, ~C ∨ D is equivalent to C → D, which is "If C, then D." C is "Emily stops working," and D is "Russell makes dinner." So, the implication is "If Emily stops working, then Russell makes dinner."

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The formula is ~C ∨ D. To convert this into an implication, we can rearrange it. The statement A ∨ B is equivalent to ~A → B. So, if I have ~C ∨ D, that's equivalent to C → D. So, "If Emily stops working (C), then Russell makes dinner (D)." So, the English translation would be "If Emily stops working, then Russell makes dinner."

Now, looking at the options provided:

A: Emily doesn't stop working unless Russell makes dinner. Hmm, that sounds like "Unless D, ~C." So, "Unless Russell makes dinner, Emily doesn't stop working." That's the contrapositive, maybe.

B: If Emily doesn't stop working then Russell makes dinner. So, ~C → D. Wait, that's not the same as our formula. Our formula is C → D. Because ~C ∨ D is equivalent to C → D, so B is not correct because it's ~C → D.

C: Emily stops working if Russell doesn't make dinner. That's ~D → C, which is the contrapositive of C → D. So, that's actually equivalent. Because if C → D, then ~D → ~C. So, if Russell doesn't make dinner (~D), then Emily doesn't stop working (~C). So, option C says "Emily stops working if Russell doesn't make dinner," which would be C if ~D. Wait, that's not matching. Let me think again. If C → D, then the contrapositive is ~D → ~C. So, "If Russell doesn't make dinner (~D), then Emily does not stop working (~C)." So, that would mean "Russell doesn't make dinner implies Emily doesn't stop working." But option C says "Emily stops working if Russell doesn't make dinner," which is C if ~D, which is C → ~D, which is not the same as our formula. So option C is incorrect.

D: Russell doesn't make dinner if Emily stops working. That's ~D if C, which is C → ~D. That's the opposite of our formula, which is C → D. So, D is incorrect.

E: If Emily stops working then Russell doesn't make dinner. That's C → ~D. Again, opposite of our formula. So E is incorrect.

F: If Russell makes dinner then Emily doesn't stop working. That's D → ~C. Which is the contrapositive of ~C → D, but our formula is C → D. Wait, no. Let me see: C → D is equivalent to ~D → ~C. So, F says D → ~C, which is not the same as our formula. So F is incorrect.

G: Russell doesn't make dinner unless Emily stops working. That sounds like ~D unless C, which is ~D → C. Which is the same as C → D, because in logic, "unless" is equivalent to implication. So, "Unless Emily stops working, Russell doesn't make dinner." Wait, no, "unless" can be tricky. Let me think. "Russell doesn't make dinner unless Emily stops working" means that for Russell to not make dinner, Emily must stop working. So, if Emily doesn't stop working (~C), then Russell makes dinner (D). Which is exactly our formula ~C ∨ D. So G is correct.

H: Emily stops working unless Russell doesn't make dinner. That would be C unless ~D, which is ~D → C. Which is not the same as our formula.

I: Russell makes dinner if Emily doesn't stop working. That's D if ~C, which is ~C → D. Which is exactly our formula. So I is also correct.

Wait, now I'm getting two options: G and I. Let me double-check.

Our formula is ~C ∨ D, which is equivalent to C → D. So, in English, that's "If Emily stops working, then Russell makes dinner." Alternatively, it can also be phrased as "Russell makes dinner unless Emily doesn't stop working," which is a bit awkward. Or more naturally, "Emily stops working only if Russell makes dinner," which is option A. Wait, no, option A says "Emily doesn't stop working unless Russell makes dinner." Hmm.

Wait, let me clarify the implications. The formula ~C ∨ D is equivalent to C → D. So, "If C then D." So, "If Emily stops working, then Russell makes dinner." Now, looking at the options, which one matches this?

Option B is "If Emily doesn't stop working then Russell makes dinner." That's ~C → D, which is not the same as C → D. So B is incorrect.

Option I is "Russell makes dinner if Emily doesn't stop working." That's D if ~C, which is ~C → D. Again, not the same as C → D.

Option G is "Russell doesn't make dinner unless Emily stops working." So, "Unless Emily stops working, Russell doesn't make dinner." That translates to ~C → ~D. Wait, no. Let me parse it. "Unless" in English often works as an exception. So, "Russell doesn't make dinner unless Emily stops working" means that Russell's not making dinner is only acceptable if Emily stops working. So, if Emily doesn't stop working (~C), then Russell must make dinner (D). That's exactly ~C → D, which is the same as our formula. Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me think again.

If the statement is "Russell doesn't make dinner unless Emily stops working," that means that the only way Russell doesn't make dinner is if Emily stops working. So, if Emily doesn't stop working, Russell must make dinner. That is, ~C → D. Which is the same as our formula ~C ∨ D. So option G is correct.

But earlier, I thought that option I was correct. Let me check option I again. Option I says "Russell makes dinner if Emily doesn't stop working," which is D if ~C, so ~C → D. That's the same as our formula. So both G and I are correct? That can't be because the options are unique.

Wait, no. Let me clarify the wording. Option G: "Russell doesn't make dinner unless Emily stops working." That means that Russell's not making dinner is conditional on Emily stopping. So, if Emily doesn't stop working, then Russell makes dinner. So, ~C → D, which matches our formula.

Option I: "Russell makes dinner if Emily doesn't stop working." That's D if ~C, which is ~C → D. So both G and I are expressing the same implication but in different ways. Wait, but looking at the options, both G and I are present. Let me read them again.

Option G: Russell doesn't make dinner unless Emily stops working.

Option I: Russell makes dinner if Emily doesn't stop working.

Wait, no. Option G is about Russell not making dinner unless Emily stops. So, if Emily doesn't stop working, then Russell must make dinner. So, ~C → D.

Option I says Russell makes dinner if Emily doesn't stop. So, same as ~C → D.

Wait, so both G and I are expressing the same thing? Or am I getting confused?

Wait, no. Let me think about it in terms of contrapositives. The formula is ~C ∨ D, which is equivalent to C → D. The contrapositive of that is ~D → ~C. So, "If Russell doesn't make dinner (~D), then Emily doesn't stop working (~C)." So, that's the contrapositive, which is logically equivalent.

So, looking at the options, which ones match C → D or its contrapositive.

Option B: ~C → D. So, if Emily doesn't stop working, then Russell makes dinner. That's not our formula; our formula is C → D.

Option I: D if ~C. That's ~C → D. Again, not our formula.

Option G: Russell doesn't make dinner unless Emily stops working. That's ~D unless C, which is ~D → C, which is equivalent to C → D (since contrapositive of ~D → C is ~C → D, which isn't our formula). Wait, no. Wait, ~D → C is equivalent to ~C → D? Let me check.

In logic, the contrapositive of A → B is ~B → ~A. So, ~D → C would have a contrapositive of ~C → D. So, if G is ~D → C, then its contrapositive is ~C → D, which is the same as option B and I.

Wait, I'm getting tangled here. Let me approach it differently.

Our formula is ~C ∨ D. Let's write out all the equivalent statements.

1. ~C ∨ D is equivalent to C → D.

2. It is also equivalent to its contrapositive, which is ~D → ~C.

So, any option that matches either C → D or ~D → ~C is correct.

Looking at the options:

Option B: If Emily doesn't stop working (~C) then Russell makes dinner (D). That's ~C → D, which is equivalent to our formula.

Option I: If Emily doesn't stop working (~C), then Russell makes dinner (D). That's the same as B.

Wait, no, I'm sorry, option I is "Russell makes dinner if Emily doesn't stop working," which is D if ~C, so ~C → D.

So both B and I are expressing ~C → D, which is equivalent to our formula.

But wait, our formula is ~C ∨ D, which is equivalent to C → D, not ~C → D. So I'm getting confused here.

Wait, no. Let me remember: in logic, A ∨ B is equivalent to ~A → B. So, ~C ∨ D is equivalent to C → D. So, the correct implication is C → D, meaning "If Emily stops working, then Russell makes dinner."

Looking at the options, which one says that?

Option E: If Emily stops working then Russell doesn't make dinner. That's C → ~D. Not correct.

Option I: Russell makes dinner if Emily doesn't stop working. That's D if ~C, which is ~C → D.

Option B: If Emily doesn't stop working then Russell makes dinner. That's ~C → D.

Wait, neither B nor I is expressing C → D. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Let me think again. Our formula is ~C ∨ D, which is equivalent to C → D. So, the correct English translation is "If Emily stops working, then Russell makes dinner."

Looking at the options, is there any option that says that? Let's see:

Option B: If Emily doesn't stop working then Russell makes dinner. So, ~C → D. Not our formula.

Option I: Russell makes dinner if Emily doesn't stop working. So, D if ~C. Again, ~C → D.

Wait, none of the options directly say "If Emily stops working, then Russell makes dinner." So perhaps I need to look for the contrapositive.

The contrapositive of C → D is ~D → ~C. So, "If Russell doesn't make dinner, then Emily doesn't stop working."

Looking at the options, which one matches that?

Option H: Emily stops working unless Russell doesn't make dinner. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. "Unless" often implies a condition. So, "Emily stops working unless Russell doesn't make dinner" would mean that Emily stops working only if Russell doesn't make dinner. Wait, that's not the same as ~D → ~C.

Alternatively, "Unless Russell makes dinner, Emily doesn't stop working." That's option A. Wait, option A is "Emily doesn't stop working unless Russell makes dinner." So, "Unless D, ~C." Which is ~D → ~C. Which is the contrapositive of our formula. So, that's correct.

Wait, so option A is the contrapositive. So, the formula ~C ∨ D is equivalent to C → D, which is equivalent to ~D → ~C. So, option A says "Emily doesn't stop working unless Russell makes dinner," which is ~D → ~C. So that's correct.

But earlier, I thought that option G was correct. Let me check option G again.

Option G: Russell doesn't make dinner unless Emily stops working. So, "Unless C, ~D." Which is ~C → ~D. Wait, no. "Unless" in this context would mean that the only way Russell doesn't make dinner is if Emily stops working. So, if Emily doesn't stop working (~C), then Russell makes dinner (D). So, that's ~C → D, which is equivalent to our formula.

Wait, now I'm getting confused because both options A and G seem to be correct, but that can't be the case. Let me think carefully.

Our formula is ~C ∨ D, which is equivalent to C → D. The contrapositive is ~D → ~C.

Option A: Emily doesn't stop working unless Russell makes dinner. That is, ~C unless D, which is ~D → ~C. So that's the contrapositive, which is correct.

Option G: Russell doesn't make dinner unless Emily stops working. That is, ~D unless C, which is ~C → ~D. Wait, no. "Unless" in this case would mean that the only way Russell doesn't make dinner is if Emily stops working. So, if Emily doesn't stop working, then Russell makes dinner. So, ~C → D, which is equivalent to our formula.

So, both options A and G are correct? That can't be, because the options are single letters.

Wait, no. Let me clarify the wording in option G. "Russell doesn't make dinner unless Emily stops working." So, the only way Russell doesn't make dinner is if Emily stops. So, if Emily doesn't stop working, then Russell makes dinner. So, ~C → D. Which is our formula.

Option A: "Emily doesn't stop working unless Russell makes dinner." So, the only way Emily doesn't stop working is if Russell makes dinner. So, if Russell doesn't make dinner, then Emily stops working. That's ~D → C. Which is the contrapositive of our formula.

Wait, so our formula is ~C ∨ D, which is equivalent to C → D and ~D → ~C.

So, option A is ~D → ~C, which is the contrapositive. So, option A is correct.

Option G is ~C → D, which is equivalent to our formula because ~C ∨ D is the same as ~C → D.

Wait, no. Wait, ~C ∨ D is equivalent to C → D, not ~C → D. Because in logic, A ∨ B is equivalent to ~A → B. So, ~C ∨ D is equivalent to C → D.

But ~C → D is equivalent to C ∨ D, which is a different statement. So, I think I made a mistake earlier.

So, let's clarify:

~C ∨ D is equivalent to C → D.

~C → D is equivalent to C ∨ D.

So, our formula is ~C ∨ D, which is equivalent to C → D.

So, the correct English translation is "If Emily stops working, then Russell makes dinner."

Looking at the options, which one says that?

Option B: If Emily doesn't stop working then Russell makes dinner. So, ~C → D. Not our formula.

Option I: If Emily doesn't stop working, Russell makes dinner. Same as B.

Option E: If Emily stops working, Russell doesn't make dinner. C → ~D. Opposite.

Option F: If Russell makes dinner, Emily doesn't stop working. D → ~C. Not our formula.

Option H: Emily stops working unless Russell doesn't make dinner. So, "Unless ~D, C." Which is ~D → C. So, if Russell doesn't make dinner, Emily stops working. Which is ~D → C. Which is the contrapositive of our formula, because our formula is ~C ∨ D, which is equivalent to C → D, whose contrapositive is ~D → ~C. So, ~D → ~C is different from ~D → C.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try a different approach.

Let me list all the options and see which one matches ~C ∨ D.

Option A: Emily doesn't stop working unless Russell makes dinner. So, ~C unless D, which is ~D → ~C. Contrapositive of our formula.

Option B: If Emily doesn't stop working then Russell makes dinner. ~C → D. Not our formula.

Option C: Emily stops working if Russell doesn't make dinner. ~D → C. Contrapositive of our formula? Wait, our formula is ~C ∨ D, which is C → D. The contrapositive is ~D → ~C. So, option C is ~D → C, which is different.

Option D: Russell doesn't make dinner if Emily stops working. C → ~D. Opposite.

Option E: If Emily stops working then Russell doesn't make dinner. C → ~D. Opposite.

Option F: If Russell makes dinner then Emily doesn't stop working. D → ~C. Opposite.

Option G: Russell doesn't make dinner unless Emily stops working. ~D unless C, which is ~C → ~D. Wait, no. "Unless" implies that the only way for the antecedent to be true is if the consequent is true. So, "Russell doesn't make dinner unless Emily stops working" means that the only way Russell doesn't make dinner is if Emily stops. So, if Emily doesn't stop working, then Russell makes dinner. So, ~C → D. Which is equivalent to our formula because ~C ∨ D is equivalent to ~C → D.

Wait, no. Wait, ~C ∨ D is equivalent to C → D, not ~C → D. Because A ∨ B is equivalent to ~A → B. So, ~C ∨ D is equivalent to C → D.

So, option G is ~C → D, which is equivalent to ~C ∨ D. So, option G is correct.

Option H: Emily stops working unless Russell doesn't make dinner. So, C unless ~D, which is ~D → C. Which is not our formula.

Option I: Russell makes dinner if Emily doesn't stop working. D if ~C, which is ~C → D. Which is equivalent to our formula.

Wait, so both G and I are correct? But that can't be. Let me check the options again.

Looking back, the options are:

A: Emily doesn't stop working unless Russell makes dinner.

B: If Emily doesn't stop working then Russell makes dinner.

C: Emily stops working if Russell doesn't make dinner.

D: Russell doesn't make dinner if Emily stops working.

E: If Emily stops working then Russell doesn't make dinner.

F: If Russell makes dinner then Emily doesn't stop working.

G: Russell doesn't make dinner unless Emily stops working.

H: Emily stops working unless Russell doesn't make dinner.

I: Russell makes dinner if Emily doesn't stop working.

So, our formula is ~C ∨ D, which is equivalent to C → D.

Looking for an option that says "If Emily stops working, then Russell makes dinner," which is C → D.

Looking at the options, none of them directly state that. So, perhaps the correct way is to look for the contrapositive or equivalent statements.

The contrapositive is ~D → ~C. So, "If Russell doesn't make dinner, then Emily doesn't stop working."

Looking for that:

Option A: Emily doesn't stop working unless Russell makes dinner. So, "Unless D, ~C." Which is ~D → ~C. So, that's the contrapositive. So, option A is correct.

Option G: Russell doesn't make dinner unless Emily stops working. So, "Unless C, ~D." Which is ~C → ~D. Which is not our formula.

Option I: Russell makes dinner if Emily doesn't stop working. So, D if ~C, which is ~C → D. Which is equivalent to our formula.

Wait, but earlier I thought that ~C ∨ D is equivalent to C → D, which is not the same as ~C → D.

Wait, no, in logic, A ∨ B is equivalent to ~A → B. So, ~C ∨ D is equivalent to C → D. So, the correct translation is C → D, which is "If Emily stops working, then Russell makes dinner."

Looking at the options, none directly state that. So perhaps the correct way is to look for the contrapositive or equivalent statements.

The contrapositive is ~D → ~C. So, "If Russell doesn't make dinner, then Emily doesn't stop working."

Looking at the options, option A says "Emily doesn't stop working unless Russell makes dinner," which is ~D → ~C. So, that's correct.

Option I says "Russell makes dinner if Emily doesn't stop working," which is ~C → D, which is equivalent to ~C ∨ D, which is our formula.

Wait, but our formula is ~C ∨ D, which is equivalent to C → D. So, both ~C → D and C → D are different. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, no. Let me clarify:

~C ∨ D is equivalent to C → D.

It is also equivalent to its contrapositive, which is ~D → ~C.

So, any option that states either C → D or ~D → ~C is correct.

Looking at the options:

Option A: ~D → ~C (contrapositive). So, correct.

Option B: ~C → D. Not equivalent to our formula.

Option I: ~C → D. Same as B.

Option G: ~C → ~D. Not equivalent.

Option H: ~D → C. Not equivalent.

So, the only correct options are A and the contrapositive.

But the options are single letters, so the correct answer would be A.

Wait, but earlier I thought option I was correct. I'm getting confused because I'm mixing up the implications.

Let me approach it with truth tables.

Let me construct the truth table for ~C ∨ D.

C | D | ~C | ~C ∨ D
T | T | F  | T
T | F | F  | F
F | T | T  | T
F | F | T  | T

So, the only time ~C ∨ D is false is when C is true and D is false.

Now, let's look at the options and see which one matches this.

Option A: Emily doesn't stop working unless Russell makes dinner. So, ~C unless D, which is ~D → ~C.

So, when D is false, ~C must be true. So, when D is F, C must be F. Which matches the only false case when C is T and D is F. So, option A correctly captures the formula.

Option I: Russell makes dinner if Emily doesn't stop working. So, D if ~C. Which is ~C → D.

In terms of truth table, ~C → D is equivalent to C ∨ D. Let's see:

C | D | ~C | ~C → D
T | T | F  | T
T | F | F  | T
F | T | T  | T
F | F | T  | F

So, ~C → D is false only when ~C is T and D is F, i.e., C is F and D is F. But our formula ~C ∨ D is false only when C is T and D is F. So, option I is not equivalent.

Therefore, the correct option is A.
</think>

The formula ~C ∨ D translates to "Emily stops working or Russell makes dinner." In logical terms, this is equivalent to "If Emily stops working, then Russell makes dinner" (C → D). Additionally, it can be expressed as "Emily doesn't stop working unless Russell makes dinner" (contrapositive: ~D → ~C).

Option A correctly captures the contrapositive, making it the correct answer.

**Answer: A**
