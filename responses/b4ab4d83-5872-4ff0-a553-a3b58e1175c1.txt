Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I have this problem where Mrs. Reeves accepted a note for $815.50 at 6% interest for four months, starting on December 10. Then, on January 10, she had it discounted at 6 and a half percent. Also, there's a 1/8% charge for collection when it's due. I need to figure out how much she received.

First, I think I should break this down step by step. Let me try to understand what's happening here. She receives a note, which is like a loan or an IOU, right? The note is for $815.50, and it's at 6% interest over four months. So, the total amount she would get if she held the note until maturity (which is four months later) would be the principal plus interest.

But then, on January 10, she decided to discount the note instead of waiting until it's due. Discounting a note means she's selling it before its maturity date, so she'll get less than the face value plus interest because the bank or whoever is discounting it will charge a higher interest rate, which is 6.5% in this case.

Wait, but the problem says she had it discounted on January 10. Let me check the dates. She accepted the note on December 10. So, from December 10 to January 10 is one month, right? Because December has 31 days, so from Dec 10 to Dec 31 is 21 days, and then January 1 to 10 is another 10 days, which totals 31 days. Wait, that's about one month. So, she's discounting it after one month, which is 31 days.

So, the first step is to calculate the interest for the first month at 6%, and then the remaining three months' interest is discounted at 6.5%. But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the note was discounted at 6.5% for the remaining period, and there's a collection charge.

Wait, I think I need to clarify: when she discounted the note on January 10, she's effectively getting the present value of the note's remaining amount. So, the note was originally for four months, but she's discounting it after one month, so the remaining term is three months. So, the discounting would be at 6.5% for three months, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the discounting is done for the entire four months but starting from January 10. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the initial note is for four months, so it's due on April 10. But on January 10, which is one month later, she discounts it. So, the time from January 10 to April 10 is three months. So, the discounting is applied for three months at 6.5%, and then there's a collection charge of 1/8% when it's due. Or maybe the collection charge is applied when she receives the discounted amount?

Wait, the problem says a (1/8)% charge for collection when due was also made. So, perhaps that's an additional charge on the amount she receives when she discounts the note. So, the total she receives would be the discounted amount minus the 1/8% charge.

Let me try to structure this.

First, calculate the maturity value of the note. The principal is $815.50 at 6% for four months.

The formula for simple interest is I = P * r * t.

Where P is principal, r is rate, t is time in years.

Since it's four months, that's 4/12 = 1/3 year, approximately 0.3333.

So, I = 815.50 * 0.06 * (4/12) = 815.50 * 0.06 * 0.3333.

Let me compute that.

0.06 * 0.3333 ≈ 0.02.

So, 815.50 * 0.02 = 16.31.

So, interest is $16.31.

Maturity value is 815.50 + 16.31 = $831.81.

Wait, but that's the maturity value if she held it until April 10. But she's discounting it on January 10, which is one month after the note was accepted. So, from December 10 to January 10 is 31 days, which is 1/3 of a year? Wait, no, 31 days is approximately 31/360 = 0.0861 years, since in banking calculations, a year is 360 days.

So, the first month's interest would be at 6% for 31 days, which is 31/360 year.

So, I1 = 815.50 * 0.06 * (31/360).

Let me compute that.

0.06 * (31/360) = 0.005166667.

815.50 * 0.005166667 ≈ 815.50 * 0.005166667 ≈ let me calculate.

815.50 * 0.005 = 4.0775.

815.50 * 0.000166667 ≈ 0.136.

So total ≈ 4.0775 + 0.136 ≈ 4.2135.

So, the interest for the first month is approximately $4.21.

So, the amount after one month (on January 10) would be 815.50 + 4.21 ≈ $819.71.

Wait, but that's the amount if she were to hold it for the first month. But she's discounting it, so instead of getting $819.71 after one month, she's getting a discounted amount based on the remaining three months at 6.5%.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think of the discounting as the present value of the maturity amount. So, the maturity amount is $831.81 (from earlier), but she's discounting it at 6.5% for three months starting from January 10.

Wait, but in my first calculation, I thought the maturity value was $831.81, but that was under 6% for four months. But when she discounts it, she's getting the present value of that maturity amount discounted at 6.5% for three months.

So, let me clarify:

1. Compute the maturity value (due in four months) at 6%: $831.81.

2. Then, from January 10 (after one month) to April 10 is three months. She discounts the maturity value at 6.5% for three months to find out how much she gets on January 10.

Wait, but that can't be right because the discounting is happening on January 10 when she's only one month into the note. So, perhaps the way to approach this is to calculate the present value of the note on January 10, considering the remaining three months at 6.5%, and then subtract the 1/8% charge.

Alternatively, maybe the total discount is calculated for the remaining three months at 6.5%, and then the collection charge is applied to the discounted amount.

Let me think again.

The note was accepted on Dec 10 for four months, so it's due on April 10. On Jan 10, which is one month later, she discounts the note. The remaining time until maturity is three months.

So, the maturity value is $831.81 as calculated earlier. But she discounts this amount at 6.5% for three months. So, the discount amount is 831.81 * (6.5% per annum) for three months.

Three months is 3/12 = 0.25 years.

So, discount amount = 831.81 * 0.065 * 0.25.

Let me compute that.

0.065 * 0.25 = 0.01625.

831.81 * 0.01625 ≈ let's calculate.

800 * 0.01625 = 13.

31.81 * 0.01625 ≈ 0.516.

So total discount ≈ 13 + 0.516 ≈ 13.516.

So, the discounted amount is 831.81 - 13.516 ≈ 818.294.

Wait, but that's just the discounting. Then, there's a 1/8% charge for collection. So, that's 0.125% (since 1/8 is 0.125). Is that charge applied on the discounted amount or on the original amount?

The problem says "a (1/8)% charge for collection when due was also made." So, when the note is due, which is on April 10, but she discounted it on Jan 10. Hmm, perhaps the collection charge is when the note is due, but she's discounting it, so maybe the charge is applied when she gets the discounted amount.

Wait, perhaps the collection charge is applied to the discounted amount she receives. So, the 1/8% is charged on the amount she receives after discounting.

So, the amount after discounting is approximately $818.29, then the 1/8% charge is 818.29 * 0.00125.

Let me compute that: 818.29 * 0.00125 ≈ 1.02286.

So, total amount received would be 818.29 - 1.02286 ≈ 817.267.

Looking at the options, E is $817.25, which is close.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation because the initial discounting may not be correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the present value of the note on Jan 10, considering the remaining three months at 6.5%, and then subtract the 1/8% charge.

Let me try that approach.

The maturity value is $831.81.

The present value (discounted) on Jan 10 is 831.81 / (1 + 0.065*(3/12)).

Because the discounting formula is PV = FV / (1 + r*t).

So, r = 6.5% = 0.065, t = 3/12 = 0.25.

So, denominator = 1 + 0.065 * 0.25 = 1 + 0.01625 = 1.01625.

PV = 831.81 / 1.01625 ≈ let's compute that.

Dividing 831.81 by 1.01625.

Well, 1.01625 is approximately 1.01625.

Let me compute 831.81 ÷ 1.01625.

First, 1.01625 * 818 = ?

1.01625 * 800 = 813.

1.01625 * 18 = approx 18.2925.

So, 813 + 18.2925 = 831.2925.

That's very close to 831.81.

So, 818 * 1.01625 ≈ 831.2925, which is just under 831.81.

The difference is 831.81 - 831.2925 ≈ 0.5175.

So, 0.5175 / 1.01625 ≈ 0.51.

So, the PV would be approximately 818 + 0.51 ≈ 818.51.

Wait, but that seems a bit off because my earlier method gave me around 818.29.

Wait, perhaps a more accurate way is to compute 831.81 / 1.01625.

Let me compute this more accurately.

Compute 831.81 ÷ 1.01625.

I can write this as 831.81 ÷ 1.01625 = ?

Let me compute 831.81 ÷ 1.01625.

First, divide numerator and denominator by 1.01625.

Alternatively, let me compute using decimals.

1.01625 × 818 = 818 × 1 + 818 × 0.01625.

818 × 1 = 818.

818 × 0.01625: Let's compute 818 × 0.01 = 8.18, 818 × 0.00625 = 5.1125.

So, total is 8.18 + 5.1125 = 13.2925.

So, 1.01625 × 818 = 818 + 13.2925 = 831.2925.

We have 831.81 as FV, so the difference is 831.81 - 831.2925 = 0.5175.

So, 0.5175 ÷ 1.01625 ≈ 0.51.

So, the PV is 818 + 0.51 = 818.51.

But wait, 818 × 1.01625 = 831.2925, so to reach 831.81, we need an additional 0.5175, which at 1.01625 per unit, gives us 0.5175 / 1.01625 ≈ 0.51.

So, PV ≈ 818.51.

Now, applying the 1/8% collection charge on this amount.

1/8% is 0.125%, so 818.51 × 0.00125 = ?

0.00125 × 800 = 1.

0.00125 × 18.51 = approx 0.0231375.

So total ≈ 1 + 0.0231375 ≈ 1.0231375.

So, the charge is approximately $1.02.

Thus, the amount she receives is 818.51 - 1.02 ≈ 817.49.

Looking at the options, E is $817.25, which is close but not exact. Maybe my calculations have some rounding errors.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute without rounding so much.

Let me try another approach.

First, calculate the exact maturity value.

Principal: $815.50

Rate: 6% per annum.

Time: 4 months = 4/12 = 1/3 year.

Interest: 815.50 × 0.06 × (1/3) = 815.50 × 0.02 = 16.31.

Maturity value: 815.50 + 16.31 = 831.81.

Then, the present value on Jan 10 (after 1 month) is calculated by discounting the maturity value at 6.5% for 3 months.

So, the discount period is 3 months, which is 3/12 = 0.25 years.

The discount rate is 6.5% per annum, so 0.065.

The discount factor is 1 + 0.065 × 0.25 = 1 + 0.01625 = 1.01625.

So, the present value (PV) is 831.81 / 1.01625.

Let me compute this division accurately.

Compute 831.81 ÷ 1.01625.

Let me compute it step by step.

1.01625 × 818 = 831.2925 as before.

Difference: 831.81 - 831.2925 = 0.5175.

Now, 0.5175 ÷ 1.01625 = ?

Let me compute 1.01625 × 0.51 = 0.519729.

But 0.51 × 1.01625 = 0.51 × 1 + 0.51 × 0.01625 = 0.51 + 0.008296875 ≈ 0.518296875.

Wait, that's more than 0.5175.

So, 0.51 × 1.01625 ≈ 0.5183.

But we have 0.5175 left, which is slightly less.

So, 0.5175 ÷ 1.01625 ≈ 0.51.

But perhaps to get more precise, let's do it as:

We have 0.5175 ÷ 1.01625.

Let me write it as (0.5175 / 1.01625) = ?

Multiply numerator and denominator by 10000 to eliminate decimals: 5175 / 10162.5.

But maybe it's easier to use decimal division.

0.5175 ÷ 1.01625 ≈ 0.51.

But perhaps it's approximately 0.51.

So, PV ≈ 818 + 0.51 = 818.51.

Now, the collection charge is 1/8% on this amount.

1/8% is 0.125%, so 818.51 × 0.00125.

Compute 818.51 × 0.00125.

Well, 800 × 0.00125 = 1.00.

18.51 × 0.00125 = 0.0231375.

Total charge ≈ 1.00 + 0.0231375 ≈ 1.0231375.

So, the amount received is 818.51 - 1.0231375 ≈ 817.48686.

Rounded to the nearest cent, that's $817.49.

Looking at the options, E is $817.25, which is close but not exact. But perhaps I made a mistake in the discounting method.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the discounting is done on the original note, not the maturity value. So, the discount is applied to the principal for the remaining three months.

Wait, that might be another way to look at it. So, the note is for four months at 6%, but she discounts it after one month at 6.5% for the remaining three months.

So, the amount she would get is the present value of the principal plus interest for four months, discounted at 6.5% for three months.

Wait, perhaps that's the correct approach.

So, the total amount at maturity is $831.81 as before.

She discounts this amount for three months at 6.5%.

So, the present value is 831.81 × (1 - (0.065 × 3/12)).

Wait, no, the discounting formula is PV = FV / (1 + r*t).

So, r = 6.5%, t = 3/12 = 0.25.

So, PV = 831.81 / (1 + 0.065*0.25) = 831.81 / 1.01625 ≈ 818.51.

Then, subtract the 1/8% charge on 818.51.

Which gives us approximately 817.49, as before.

But the options don't have 817.49. The closest is E: 817.25.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the discounting is done on the principal for the remaining three months, not on the maturity value.

So, alternative approach:

The original note is $815.50 at 6% for four months. On Jan 10, after one month, she discounts the remaining three months at 6.5%.

So, the interest for the first month is 815.50 × 0.06 × (1/12) = 815.50 × 0.005 = $4.0775.

So, after one month, the amount would be 815.50 + 4.0775 = $819.5775.

But she's discounting it, so she gets the present value of the remaining three months' amount at 6.5%.

Wait, no, perhaps she's discounting the remaining three months' interest at 6.5%.

Alternatively, the amount she receives is the present value of the remaining three months' principal plus interest.

Wait, maybe I should compute the interest for the remaining three months at 6%, then discount that at 6.5%.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe a better approach is to compute the total amount due at maturity, then find the present value on Jan 10 for the remaining three months at 6.5%, then subtract the 1/8% charge.

So, total maturity value is $831.81.

On Jan 10, the present value is 831.81 / 1.01625 = 818.51.

Then, subtract 1/8% of 818.51, which is 818.51 × 0.00125 = 1.0231.

So, 818.51 - 1.0231 ≈ 817.49.

But the options don't have 817.49. The closest is E: 817.25.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the maturity value.

Let me recalculate the maturity value.

Principal: $815.50.

Rate: 6% per annum.

Time: 4 months = 4/12 = 1/3 year.

Interest: 815.50 × 0.06 × (1/3) = 815.50 × 0.02 = $16.31.

Maturity value: 815.50 + 16.31 = $831.81.

That seems correct.

Then, discounting at 6.5% for three months: 831.81 / 1.01625 ≈ 818.51.

Then, 1/8% charge: 818.51 × 0.00125 ≈ 1.023.

So, 818.51 - 1.023 ≈ 817.49.

Hmm. The closest option is E: $817.25.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the collection charge is on the original amount after discounting, not the present value.

Alternatively, perhaps the discounting is done on the principal for the remaining three months at 6.5%, and then the interest is added, and then the collection charge is applied.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

1. The note is for $815.50 at 6% for four months.

2. On Jan 10, she discounts the note at 6.5% for the remaining three months.

So, the present value she receives is the principal plus the interest for four months, discounted at 6.5% for three months.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because she's discounting the note, so she's getting less than the maturity value.

Alternatively, the present value is calculated as the maturity value discounted at 6.5% for three months.

So, as before, 831.81 / 1.01625 ≈ 818.51.

Then, subtract the 1/8% charge: 818.51 × 0.00125 ≈ 1.023.

So, 818.51 - 1.023 ≈ 817.49.

But since the options don't have that, maybe I should check if the discounting is for the entire four months at 6.5%, but starting from Jan 10.

Wait, that would mean the discounting period is four months, but from Jan 10, which would make the total discounting period four months, but the note was only valid for four months from Dec 10, so it's due on April 10. If she discounts it on Jan 10, the remaining time is three months, not four.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the discounting for three months.

Wait, another approach: the amount she receives is the present value of the maturity amount, discounted at 6.5% for three months, then subtract the 1/8% charge.

So, that's 831.81 / 1.01625 ≈ 818.51, then subtract 1.023 to get 817.49.

But since the options don't have that, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me check the discounting again.

6.5% per annum for three months is 6.5% * (3/12) = 1.625%.

So, the discount factor is 1 / (1 + 0.01625) = 1 / 1.01625 ≈ 0.9839.

So, 831.81 * 0.9839 ≈ let's compute that.

831.81 * 0.9839.

Compute 831.81 × 0.98 = 815.1778.

831.81 × 0.0039 ≈ 3.244.

So, total ≈ 815.1778 + 3.244 ≈ 818.4218.

So, approximately $818.42.

Then, subtract the 1/8% charge on 818.42.

1/8% is 0.125%, so 818.42 × 0.00125 = 1.023.

So, 818.42 - 1.023 ≈ 817.397.

Rounded to the nearest cent, that's $817.40.

Again, the options don't have that, but E is $817.25, which is close.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the initial calculation of the maturity value is incorrect because the interest is simple interest for four months, which is correct. Then, the discounting is at 6.5% for three months, which is correct.

Wait, maybe the collection charge is applied on the original principal, not the discounted amount. But that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the collection charge is applied on the discounted amount after the discount.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the collection charge is applied when the note is due, but since she's discounting it, she pays the charge upfront. So, maybe the 1/8% is applied to the discounted amount.

Wait, but in any case, the calculation seems to be leading towards approximately $817.40, which isn't exactly an option. The closest option is E: $817.25.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, let me try another way. Perhaps the discounting is done on the original principal for the remaining three months at 6.5%, and then the interest for the first month is added.

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated using exact days. Since from Dec 10 to Jan 10 is 31 days, which is 31/360 years.

So, the interest for the first month is 815.50 × 0.06 × (31/360) = 815.50 × 0.00516667 ≈ 4.21.

So, the amount after one month is 815.50 + 4.21 ≈ 819.71.

Then, the remaining three months are discounted at 6.5%.

So, the present value of 819.71 for three months at 6.5% is 819.71 / (1 + 0.065*(3/12)) = 819.71 / 1.01625 ≈ 806.62.

Wait, that can't be right because that's lower than the principal. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the approaches.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is:

The total amount at maturity is $831.81.

The discounting is done for three months at 6.5%, so the present value is 831.81 / 1.01625 ≈ 818.51.

Then, subtract the 1/8% charge: 818.51 × 0.00125 ≈ 1.023.

So, total received is approximately 818.51 - 1.023 ≈ 817.49.

Since the options don't have this, perhaps the correct answer is E: $817.25.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the discounting is for the remaining three months, but the interest is calculated on the discounted amount.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to compute the discount amount as the maturity value minus the present value, then subtract the collection charge.

So, discount amount = 831.81 - 818.51 ≈ 13.30.

Then, collection charge is 1/8% of the discounted amount, which is 818.51 × 0.00125 ≈ 1.023.

So, total she receives is 818.51 - 1.023 ≈ 817.49.

Again, same result.

But since the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the discounting to be done on the principal for the remaining three months, not the maturity value.

So, principal is $815.50.

Remaining time: three months.

Discount rate: 6.5% per annum.

So, discount factor is 1 / (1 + 0.065*(3/12)) = 1 / 1.01625 ≈ 0.9839.

So, present value of principal: 815.50 × 0.9839 ≈ 803.02.

Then, add the interest for the first month: 4.21.

So, total amount after discounting and adding first month's interest: 803.02 + 4.21 ≈ 807.23.

Then, subtract the 1/8% charge on this amount: 807.23 × 0.00125 ≈ 1.009.

So, total received: 807.23 - 1.009 ≈ 806.22.

But that's not matching any options either.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the correct approach is to compute the discounting on the principal for the remaining three months at 6.5%, then add the interest for the first month, then subtract the 1/8% charge.

So, principal after discounting: 815.50 × (1 - 0.065*(3/12)) = 815.50 × (1 - 0.01625) = 815.50 × 0.98375 ≈ 803.02.

Then, add interest for first month: 4.21.

Total: 803.02 + 4.21 ≈ 807.23.

Then, subtract 1/8% charge: 807.23 × 0.00125 ≈ 1.009.

So, total received: 807.23 - 1.009 ≈ 806.22.

But that's not in the options either.

I think I'm stuck. Let me try to see what the options are.

Options are:

A: 832.50

B: 820.00

C: 831.81

D: 815.50

E: 817.25

F: 810.00

G: 799.25

H: 805.75

I: 800.00

J: 790.50

From my earlier calculations, the closest I got was around $817.49, which isn't an option. The closest is E: $817.25.

Alternatively, maybe the calculation is different. Let me try to compute the present value without the collection charge first.

Maturity value: $831.81.

Discounting at 6.5% for three months: 831.81 / 1.01625 ≈ 818.51.

Now, the collection charge is 1/8% of this amount: 818.51 × 0.00125 ≈ 1.023.

So, total received: 818.51 - 1.023 ≈ 817.49.

Rounding to the nearest cent, it's $817.49.

But the options don't have that. However, option E is $817.25, which is close.

Alternatively, perhaps the collection charge is applied on the original principal, which is $815.50.

So, 815.50 × 0.00125 = 1.019375.

So, total received after discounting: 818.51 - 1.019375 ≈ 817.49.

Same as before.

Wait, maybe the problem expects the discounting to be done for the entire four months at 6.5%, but she's discounting it after one month, so the discounting period is three months.

Wait, I think I've tried that approach already.

Alternatively, perhaps the discounting is done on the note's face value, not the maturity value.

So, face value is $815.50.

She discounts it at 6.5% for three months: 815.50 / 1.01625 ≈ 802.05.

Then, add the interest for the first month: 4.21.

Total: 802.05 + 4.21 ≈ 806.26.

Then, subtract 1/8% charge: 806.26 × 0.00125 ≈ 1.0078.

Total: 806.26 - 1.0078 ≈ 805.25.

Which is close to option H: 805.75, but not exact.

I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to compute the amount she receives as the present value of the note on Jan 10 at 6.5% for three months, then subtract the 1/8% charge.

So, present value = 831.81 / 1.01625 ≈ 818.51.

Then, subtract 1/8% of 818.51: 818.51 × 0.00125 ≈ 1.023.

So, total amount received: 818.51 - 1.023 ≈ 817.49.

Since the options don't have this, perhaps the intended answer is E: $817.25.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the discounting to be done on the principal for the remaining three months, not the maturity value.

So, principal after discounting: 815.50 / 1.01625 ≈ 802.05.

Then, add the interest for the first month: 4.21.

Total: 802.05 + 4.21 ≈ 806.26.

Subtract 1/8% charge: 806.26 × 0.00125 ≈ 1.0078.

Total: 806.26 - 1.0078 ≈ 805.25.

But that's not matching any option either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using 365 days for discounting.

So, from Dec 10 to Jan 10 is 31 days.

So, the first month's interest is 815.50 × 0.06 × (31/365) ≈ 815.50 × 0.0005082 ≈ 4.14.

So, amount after one month: 815.50 + 4.14 ≈ 819.64.

Then, discounting the maturity value of $831.81 at 6.5% for three months (using 365 days).

Three months is 90 days.

So, discount factor: 1 + 0.065*(90/365) ≈ 1 + 0.065*0.2466 ≈ 1 + 0.01603 ≈ 1.01603.

So, present value: 831.81 / 1.01603 ≈ 818.54.

Then, subtract 1/8% charge: 818.54 × 0.00125 ≈ 1.023.

Total received: 818.54 - 1.023 ≈ 817.52.

Still, the closest option is E: 817.25.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the collection charge is applied on the original principal, not the discounted amount.

So, 815.50 × 0.00125 ≈ 1.019.

Then, the amount after discounting is 818.51.

So, total received: 818.51 - 1.019 ≈ 817.49.

Same as before.

I think I've exhausted the approaches and the closest option is E: $817.25.

To determine how much Mrs. Reeves received after discounting the note, we need to calculate the maturity value of the note and then discount it at the given rate, considering the collection charge.

1. **Maturity Value Calculation**:
   - Principal: $815.50
   - Rate: 6% per annum
   - Time: 4 months = 4/12 = 1/3 year
   - Interest: \( 815.50 \times 0.06 \times \frac{1}{3} = 16.31 \)
   - Maturity Value: \( 815.50 + 16.31 = 831.81 \)

2. **Discounting the Note**:
   - The note is discounted on January 10, which is one month after acceptance. The remaining term is three months.
   - Discount Rate: 6.5% per annum for three months = \( 6.5\% \times \frac{3}{12} = 1.625\% \)
   - Discount Factor: \( 1 + 0.01625 = 1.01625 \)
   - Present Value (Discounted Amount): \( \frac{831.81}{1.01625} \approx 818.51 \)

3. **Collection Charge**:
   - A \( \frac{1}{8}\% \) charge is applied to the discounted amount.
   - Collection Charge: \( 818.51 \times 0.00125 \approx 1.023 \)
   - Total Amount Received: \( 818.51 - 1.023 \approx 817.49 \)

4. **Closest Option**:
   - The calculated amount is approximately $817.49, which is closest to option **E: $817.25**.

**Answer: E**
