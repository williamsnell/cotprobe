Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a gas in a piston cylinder arrangement undergoing compression. One pound of gas is compressed from 500 psia to 50 psia. The initial volume is 3 cubic feet per pound. The process follows a relation where p*v^1.4 is a constant. We need to calculate the change in internal energy, given that the work done is equal to the heat transferred to the surroundings.

Hmm, wait, the work performed is equal to the amount of heat transferred to the surroundings. So, W = Q? Or is it Q that's equal to W? Because in the first law, ΔU = Q - W, where W is work done by the system. If W is work done on the system, maybe the signs change. I'll have to be careful with that.

First, let me jot down what I know:

- The process is p*v^1.4 = constant. That suggests a polytropic process with index n=1.4. So, the relation between pressure and volume is p1*v1^1.4 = p2*v2^1.4.

- Mass m = 1 lbm. So, we can find volume change for the mass.

- Initial pressure p1 = 500 psia, final p2 = 50 psia.

- Initial specific volume v1 = 3 ft³/lbm.

Wait, specific volume is volume per unit mass, so that's correct.

Since it's a polytropic process, I can find the final specific volume v2 using the relation:

p1 * v1^n = p2 * v2^n

So, rearranging:

v2 = v1 * (p1 / p2)^(1/n)

Given n = 1.4, so 1/n ≈ 0.7143.

Plugging the numbers:

v2 = 3 * (500 / 50)^(1/1.4) = 3 * (10)^(0.7143)

Wait, 10^0.7143 is approximately? Let me think. 10^0.7 is about 5.01, because 10^0.7 ≈ 5.0119. 0.7143 is a bit higher. Maybe around 5.08? Let me calculate more accurately.

Alternatively, using logarithms or a calculator. Since I don't have a calculator, I'll approximate. Let's say 10^0.7143 ≈ 5.08.

So, v2 ≈ 3 * 5.08 ≈ 15.24 ft³/lbm.

Wait, but that's specific volume. So the mass is 1 lbm, so total volume would be 15.24 ft³, but since specific volume is per lbm, that makes sense.

Next, I need to find the work done during the compression. Since it's a polytropic process, the work can be calculated using the formula for polytropic processes:

W = (p2 * v2 - p1 * v1) / (1 - n)

Wait, but wait. The formula I remember for work in a polytropic process is:

W = (p2 v2 - p1 v1) / (1 - n) when n ≠ 1.

But let me confirm the sign. Since the process is compression, work is done on the system, so W would be positive from the system's perspective? Or is it negative when the system is compressed because the surroundings do work on the system.

Wait, in thermodynamics, work done by the system is considered positive. So if the gas is compressed, work is done on the system, so W would be negative from the system's perspective.

But in the formula, I think the work done by the system is W = (p2 v2 - p1 v1) / (1 - n).

Wait, no, let me think again. For expansion, work is positive when done by the system. For compression, work is negative when done by the system, but positive when considered as work done on the system.

Alternatively, the formula for work in a polytropic process is:

W = (p1 v1 - p2 v2) / (n - 1)

Wait, perhaps I should check the exact formula.

The work done during a polytropic process is given by:

W = (p1 v1 - p2 v2) / (n - 1)

Because for n > 1, when pressure decreases, volume increases, but for compression, n=1.4, so when pressure increases, volume decreases.

Alternatively, another formula is:

W = (p2 v2 - p1 v1) / (1 - n)

Because when n=1.4, 1 - n is negative, so W would be negative, which would make sense for compression (work done on the system).

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me make sure.

The general formula for work in a polytropic process is:

W = (p1 v1 - p2 v2) / (n - 1)

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the formula is:

W = (p2 v2 - p1 v1) / (1 - n)

Let me check units. Work should be in ft-lbf per lbm.

Let me compute both ways and see which makes sense.

Given that the process is compression, so work is done on the system, so the work should be positive (from the system's perspective, it's negative). Wait, no, I think for work done on the system, W is positive when considering the system's work input.

Wait, in the first law, ΔU = Q - W, where W is the work done by the system. So if work is done on the system, W is negative, so ΔU = Q + |W|.

But in this problem, the work performed is equal to the heat transferred to the surroundings. Wait, the wording says "the work performed is equal to the amount of heat transferred to the surroundings." So, W = Q.

Wait, but in the first law, ΔU = Q - W, where W is work done by the system. So if W is the work done by the system, and Q is heat leaving the system (since it's transferred to the surroundings), then Q would be negative. So perhaps W = -Q.

But the problem states that W = Q, so maybe I have to adjust the signs.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using W as the work done on the system, so W = Q, where Q is positive when heat is added to the system. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, let's read the problem again. "The work performed is equal to the amount of heat transferred to the surroundings." So, W = Q, but I'm not sure about the signs.

Wait, when the system does work on the surroundings, W is positive, and Q is positive if heat is added to the system. But in this case, the gas is being compressed, so work is done on the system (so W would be negative from the system's perspective, as work done by the system is negative when work is done on it).

Wait, perhaps I should proceed without worrying about the sign yet and then adjust later.

Let me compute the work using the formula I think is correct.

So, using W = (p1 v1 - p2 v2) / (n - 1)

Given p1 = 500 psia, v1 = 3 ft³/lbm.

p2 = 50 psia, v2 ≈ 15.24 ft³/lbm (from earlier calculation).

n = 1.4.

So, plugging in:

W = (500*3 - 50*15.24) / (1.4 - 1) 

Wait, but wait. The units for pressure and volume need to be compatible. Since work is in ft-lbf, and 1 psia = 144 psf (pounds per square foot), and 1 ft³ is 12 in³, but perhaps it's easier to convert everything into consistent units.

Alternatively, since the formula for work in polytropic processes might already account for the units, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation in terms of specific work, so per unit mass.

Wait, but let's think about it. The formula for work in a polytropic process is:

W = (p1 v1 - p2 v2) / (n - 1)

But in consistent units, pressure in psia, specific volume in ft³/lbm, and work will be in (psia * ft³/lbm) / (unitless) → which is (lbf/ft² * ft³/lbm) → (ft-lbf/lbm), since 1 psia = 1 lbf/ft².

Yes, because 1 psia = 1 lbf per square foot, so when you multiply by specific volume in ft³/lbm, you get (lbf/ft²)*(ft³/lbm) = (ft-lbf)/lbm.

So the units will be correct.

So let's compute:

p1 = 500 psia, v1 = 3 ft³/lbm.

p2 = 50 psia, v2 ≈ 15.24 ft³/lbm.

n = 1.4.

So,

W = (500 * 3 - 50 * 15.24) / (1.4 - 1)

First, compute numerator:

500 * 3 = 1500.

50 * 15.24 = 762.

So 1500 - 762 = 738.

Denominator: 1.4 - 1 = 0.4.

So W = 738 / 0.4 = 1845 ft-lbf/lbm.

Wait, but wait. Is this the work done by the system or on the system? Since the process is compression, the system's volume decreases, so work is done on the system, meaning the system does negative work. So in the formula, W is the work done by the system, which would be negative in this case. So W = -1845 ft-lbf/lbm.

But in the problem statement, it's said that the work performed is equal to the heat transferred to the surroundings. Wait, let me parse that.

The problem says: "the work performed is equal to the amount of heat transferred to the surroundings."

So, W = Q, but I need to be careful with the signs.

In the first law, ΔU = Q - W, where W is the work done by the system. So if W is positive, the system did work on the surroundings, and Q would be positive if heat is added to the system.

But in this case, the system is being compressed, so W (work done by the system) is negative. So W = -1845 ft-lbf/lbm.

The problem states that W = Q, so Q = W = -1845 ft-lbf/lbm.

Wait, but if W is the work done by the system, and Q is the heat leaving the system (since it's transferred to the surroundings), then Q would be negative. But according to the problem, W equals Q, so W = Q = -1845 ft-lbf/lbm.

Wait, but the problem says "work performed is equal to the amount of heat transferred to the surroundings." So perhaps W (work done by the system) equals Q (heat leaving the system, so negative).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is stating that the magnitude of work is equal to the magnitude of heat transfer, but signs depend on direction.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me proceed.

Now, I need to find the change in internal energy, ΔU.

The first law says ΔU = Q - W.

But in this problem, W = Q, so substituting:

ΔU = Q - W = Q - Q = 0.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if W = Q, then ΔU would be zero. But looking at the options, option I is 0 Btu/lbm. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait, that seems too straightforward. Am I missing something here?

Wait, but I think I might have messed up the signs. Let me double-check.

In the first law, ΔU = Q - W, where W is work done by the system. In this case, since the system is being compressed, W (work done by the system) is negative. So W = -1845 ft-lbf/lbm.

The problem states that W = Q. So Q would be equal to W, which is negative.

So Q = W = -1845 ft-lbf/lbm.

Then, ΔU = Q - W = (-1845) - (-1845) = 0.

So the change in internal energy is zero. That would correspond to option I.

But wait, that seems counterintuitive. How can the internal energy change be zero when work is done on the system and heat is released? Or is it because the heat released exactly equals the work done, leading to no change in internal energy.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the sign when calculating W.

Wait, perhaps the formula I used for work gives the work done on the system as positive. Let me check that.

The formula I used, W = (p1 v1 - p2 v2)/(n - 1), gives the work done on the system when n > 1. Because in expansion (n > 1), the system does work, so W would be negative. But for compression, n >1, so p2 < p1, v2 > v1, so (p1 v1 - p2 v2) is positive, and since n-1 is positive (1.4 -1 = 0.4), W is positive, meaning work is done on the system.

So in this case, W is positive, work done on the system is W = 1845 ft-lbf/lbm.

Then, according to the problem, W = Q. So Q = 1845 ft-lbf/lbm.

Then, ΔU = Q - W = 1845 - 1845 = 0.

So the change in internal energy is zero, which is option I.

Wait, but let me think again about the first law.

ΔU = Q - W, where W is work done by the system. So if W is the work done on the system, then W would be negative from the system's perspective. So in that case, W (work done by system) is negative, so W = -1845.

Then, Q is the heat added to the system. Since the problem says W = Q, and W is negative, Q would be negative. So heat is leaving the system.

So, ΔU = Q - W = (-1845) - (-1845) = 0.

Yes, that makes sense. So the internal energy change is zero.

But wait, that would mean that the internal energy doesn't change, which might be the case if the process is such that the heat released is exactly equal to the work done on the system, leading to no net change in internal energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the specific heat at constant pressure or something else, but in this case, since the process is polytropic, the internal energy change can be calculated using the relation for polytropic processes.

Wait, another approach: for a polytropic process, the change in temperature can be found, and then using specific heat at constant volume, we can find ΔU.

The relation for temperature in a polytropic process is:

(T2 / T1) = (p2 / p1)^( (n - 1)/n )

So, let's compute T2.

But wait, I don't have the initial temperature T1. But perhaps I can find it using the ideal gas law. Let's assume ideal gas behavior.

The ideal gas equation is pV = mRT.

So, for initial state:

p1 v1 = R T1

Similarly, for final state:

p2 v2 = R T2

So, T1 = (p1 v1) / (R)

T2 = (p2 v2) / (R)

Then, ΔU = m * Cv * (T2 - T1)

But I don't know Cv, but for an ideal gas, Cv is constant. But since the problem doesn't specify the gas, perhaps it's assuming air or another specific gas, but I don't have that info. Alternatively, maybe for this problem, we can proceed without it because the first law gives us ΔU = 0.

Wait, but in the first approach, using the first law, we found ΔU = 0. So perhaps that's the correct answer.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem states that work performed is equal to heat transferred to the surroundings. So W = Q. But in the first law, ΔU = Q - W, where W is work done by the system. If W is work done on the system, then W is negative, and Q would be negative as well because heat is leaving the system.

So, ΔU = (-W') - (-W') = 0, where W' is the magnitude of work done on the system.

Yes, that's consistent.

So, the change in internal energy is zero, which is option I.

But wait, looking back at the options, option I is "0 Btu/lbm (no change in internal energy)." So that would be the answer.

But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the work calculation.

Wait, I calculated v2 as 15.24 ft³/lbm. Let me recalculate that.

v2 = v1 * (p1/p2)^(1/n) = 3 * (500/50)^(1/1.4) = 3 * (10)^(0.7143)

Now, 10^0.7143. Let me compute that more accurately.

We know that log10(5) ≈ 0.69897, so 10^0.7 ≈ 5.0119.

But 0.7143 is 0.7 + 0.0143.

So, using the Taylor series approximation for 10^x around x=0.7.

Alternatively, using natural logarithm:

ln(10^0.7143) = 0.7143 * ln(10) ≈ 0.7143 * 2.302585 ≈ 1.644.

So, e^1.644 ≈ 5.197.

Wait, because e^1.6 is approximately 4.953, e^1.7 is about 5.474.

So, 1.644 is between 1.6 and 1.7. Let's approximate e^1.644 ≈ 5.18.

So, 10^0.7143 ≈ 5.18.

Thus, v2 ≈ 3 * 5.18 ≈ 15.54 ft³/lbm.

Wait, that's a bit different from my earlier calculation of 15.24. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, if I use a calculator, 10^(0.7143) is approximately 5.18.

So, v2 = 3 * 5.18 = 15.54 ft³/lbm.

So, the work done would be:

W = (p1 v1 - p2 v2) / (n - 1) = (500*3 - 50*15.54) / (0.4)

Compute numerator:

500*3 = 1500.

50*15.54 = 777.

So, 1500 - 777 = 723.

Then, 723 / 0.4 = 1807.5 ft-lbf/lbm.

Wait, so earlier I had 1845, but with more accurate v2, it's 1807.5.

But regardless, the key point is that W = Q, so ΔU = 0.

But let me check if the process is indeed polytropic. The problem states that p v^1.4 is constant, so yes, it's a polytropic process with n=1.4.

So, with that, I think the correct answer is I: 0 Btu/lbm.
</think>

The problem involves a gas undergoing compression in a piston-cylinder arrangement, following the relation \( p v^{1.4} = \text{constant} \). The mass of the gas is 1 lbm, with initial pressure \( p_1 = 500 \, \text{psia} \), final pressure \( p_2 = 50 \, \text{psia} \), and initial specific volume \( v_1 = 3 \, \text{ft}^3/\text{lbm} \). The work performed during compression is equal to the heat transferred to the surroundings, and the goal is to determine the change in internal energy (\( \Delta U \)).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Polytropic Process Relation**:  
   The process follows \( p v^{1.4} = \text{constant} \), implying a polytropic index \( n = 1.4 \). Using the relation \( p_1 v_1^n = p_2 v_2^n \), the final specific volume \( v_2 \) is calculated as:  
   \[
   v_2 = v_1 \left( \frac{p_1}{p_2} \right)^{1/n} = 3 \times \left( \frac{500}{50} \right)^{1/1.4} \approx 15.54 \, \text{ft}^3/\text{lbm}.
   \]

2. **Work Done**:  
   For a polytropic process, the work done on the system is given by:  
   \[
   W = \frac{p_1 v_1 - p_2 v_2}{n - 1}.
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   W = \frac{(500 \times 3) - (50 \times 15.54)}{1.4 - 1} = \frac{1500 - 777}{0.4} = 1807.5 \, \text{ft-lbf/lbm}.
   \]  
   Since the work is done on the system, \( W > 0 \).

3. **First Law of Thermodynamics**:  
   The first law states \( \Delta U = Q - W \), where \( Q \) is the heat added to the system. The problem specifies \( W = Q \), meaning the heat transferred to the surroundings is equal in magnitude to the work done. Substituting \( W = Q \):  
   \[
   \Delta U = Q - W = W - W = 0.
   \]  
   Thus, the change in internal energy is zero.

### Conclusion:
The change in internal energy is \( \Delta U = 0 \, \text{Btu/lbm} \), corresponding to option **I**.
