Okay, so Ms. Gutierrez needs to order rope for her gym class, and she has 32 students. Each student gets a piece that's 5 feet 8 inches long. I need to find the total length of rope she needs to order. Hmm, let's think about this step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with measurements, it's often easier to convert everything into the same unit before doing the calculation. So, I should probably convert feet and inches into just inches or just feet. Let me decide which would be easier. Since each student's rope is given in feet and inches, maybe converting each length entirely into inches will make the multiplication straightforward.

So, each rope is 5 feet 8 inches. I know that 1 foot is 12 inches, so 5 feet would be 5 * 12 inches. Let me calculate that: 5 times 12 is 60 inches. Then, adding the 8 inches, that makes each rope 60 + 8 = 68 inches long.

Now, there are 32 students, each needing 68 inches of rope. So, the total length in inches would be 32 multiplied by 68. Let me do that multiplication. Hmm, 32 times 60 is 1920, and 32 times 8 is 256. Adding those together: 1920 + 256 equals 2176 inches. 

But the answer options are in feet and inches, so I need to convert 2176 inches back into feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, I'll divide 2176 by 12. Let me calculate that. 

Dividing 2176 by 12: 12 goes into 2176 how many times? Well, 12 times 180 is 2160. Subtracting that from 2176 leaves 16. So, 180 feet and 16 inches. Wait, but 16 inches is more than a foot. Oh, right, 16 inches is 1 foot and 4 inches because 12 inches make a foot. So, adding that to the 180 feet, the total becomes 181 feet and 4 inches.

Let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, each student is 5'8", which is 68 inches. 32 students times 68 inches equals 2176 inches. Dividing 2176 by 12 gives 181.333... feet, which is 181 feet and 0.333... of a foot. Since 0.333... of a foot is 4 inches (because 0.333 * 12 = 4), that matches up. So the total is indeed 181 feet 4 inches.

Looking back at the options, option B is 181 feet 4 inches. That should be the correct answer.

The total length of rope needed is 181 feet 4 inches, which corresponds to option B.
