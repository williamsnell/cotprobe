Okay, so Patricia's starting salary is $20,000. After one year, her salary increases by 10%, and then after the second year, it increases by another 10% over the previous year's salary. I need to find out what her salary is after these two years.

First, I'll calculate the increase after the first year. A 10% increase on $20,000. To find 10% of 20,000, I can multiply 20,000 by 0.10. That gives me $2,000. So her new salary after the first year is 20,000 + 2,000 = $22,000.

Now, the second year's increase is also 10%, but this time it's 10% of her new salary from the first year, which is $22,000. So I'll calculate 10% of 22,000. That's 22,000 * 0.10 = $2,200. Adding that to her current salary, her salary after the second year is 22,000 + 2,200 = $24,200.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting salary is 20k. First year increase: 10% of 20k is 2k, so 22k. Second year increase: 10% of 22k is 2.2k, so 22k + 2.2k = 24.2k. Yeah, that seems right.

Looking at the options, option D is $24,200, which matches my calculation. So the correct answer should be D.

The salary increases by 10% each year. After the first year, it's $22,000, and after the second year, it becomes $24,200. The correct answer is D.

Answer: D
