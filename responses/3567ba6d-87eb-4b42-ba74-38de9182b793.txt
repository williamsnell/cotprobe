Okay, so I have this physics problem about light and shutters. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question says that a narrow band of light with a mean wavelength of 520 nm is chopped by a shutter at a frequency of 40 MHz. I need to find the bandwidth of the resulting light in angstroms. Hmm, I remember that when you chop light with a shutter, it creates a modulation, and the bandwidth relates to that modulation frequency.

Wait, I think this has to do with the uncertainty principle or maybe the Fourier transform. Oh right, when you modulate light, it introduces sidebands. The central frequency is the mean wavelength, and the modulation creates sidebands at plus and minus the modulation frequency. So the bandwidth would be twice the modulation frequency in terms of frequency, but I need to convert that into wavelength terms.

So the frequency of the shutter is 40 MHz, which is 40 million cycles per second. The formula I think I need is the relationship between frequency and wavelength. The speed of light c is lambda times nu. But wait, here I might need to relate the frequency modulation to the change in wavelength.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the Doppler effect or the linewidth due to the chopping. Oh, right! When you have a periodic modulation, the resulting spectrum has a certain bandwidth. The formula I recall is that the bandwidth Δλ is approximately equal to λ^2 multiplied by the modulation frequency, divided by the speed of light, or something like that.

Wait, let me think. The relation between frequency modulation and wavelength bandwidth. The general idea is that the change in wavelength (Δλ) is related to the modulation frequency (f) and the original wavelength (λ). The formula might be Δλ ≈ λ * (2f/c), because each modulation would cause a shift in both the positive and negative directions, so doubling the frequency term.

Wait, let me get that right. The Doppler shift formula is Δλ/λ = v/c, where v is the velocity. But in this case, it's not a velocity but a modulation frequency. Alternatively, I might need to consider the frequency of the modulation and how it affects the spread in wavelengths.

Alternatively, perhaps the method is to calculate the time between chops. The period T is 1/f, so 1/(40e6) seconds. The uncertainty in time Δt is roughly T/2, since each chop would create a rise and fall. Then, the uncertainty in frequency Δf is 1/(Δt), which would be about 2f. But wait, that's just the modulation frequency. But how does that translate to wavelength bandwidth?

Oh, right, because the frequency uncertainty Δf would correspond to a wavelength uncertainty Δλ. The relation between frequency and wavelength is c = λ * f, so taking differentials, c = λ d(f) + f d(λ). Rearranging, dλ = (λ / f) * d(f). So Δλ ≈ (λ / f) * Δf. But wait, if the modulation is at frequency f, then the uncertainty in frequency Δf is about f, because each modulation creates a spread around the central frequency. So maybe Δf ≈ f.

Wait, no, that can't be right because that would make Δλ proportional to λ, which might not fit the options given. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model the modulation as creating a frequency component at the modulation frequency, which would lead to a spread in the wavelength. So the central wavelength is 520 nm, and the modulation frequency is 40 MHz. The bandwidth would be twice the modulation frequency in terms of frequency, but I need to convert that to wavelength.

Wait, the formula I think is Δλ = λ * (2Δf) / (c), where Δf is the modulation frequency. Because each modulation adds a ±Δf to the central frequency, leading to a spread in wavelength.

So let me plug in the numbers. λ is 520 nm, which is 520e-9 meters. c is approximately 3e8 m/s. Δf is 40 MHz, which is 40e6 Hz.

So Δλ = 520e-9 m * (2 * 40e6 Hz) / (3e8 m/s)

Let me compute this step by step.

First, calculate 2 * 40e6 = 80e6 Hz.

Then, 80e6 / 3e8 = 80e6 / 3e8 = (80 / 300) * 1e-2 = (8/30) * 1e-2 = (4/15) * 1e-2 ≈ 0.002666... which is about 2.666e-3.

Now multiply by λ: 520e-9 m * 2.666e-3 ≈ 520e-9 * 0.002666.

Wait, 520e-9 is 5.2e-7 meters. So 5.2e-7 * 0.002666 ≈ 1.38e-9 meters, which is 1.38e-9 m = 1.38 nm.

Wait, that's about 1.38 nm. But looking at the options, the closest is option F: 8 × 10^-5 nm, which is 0.00008 nm. Hmm, that's way smaller than what I got. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Maybe the correct formula is Δλ = λ^2 * (Δf) / c. Let me try that.

Δλ = (520e-9 m)^2 * (40e6 Hz) / (3e8 m/s)

Calculating numerator: (520e-9)^2 = (520)^2 * 1e-18 = 270400e-18 = 2.704e-13 m².

Multiply by 40e6: 2.704e-13 * 40e6 = 2.704e-13 * 4e7 = 1.0816e-5 m²/s.

Divide by c (3e8 m/s): (1.0816e-5) / (3e8) = 3.605e-14 m.

Convert to nm: 3.605e-14 m = 3.605e-5 nm.

Wait, that's approximately 3.6 × 10^-5 nm, which is 3.6e-5 nm. Looking at the options, option H is 3 ×10^-5 nm. That's close.

Wait, but I thought the initial approach gave me 1.38 nm, but that was when I used Δλ=λ*(2Δf/c). But that gave a much larger result, which doesn't match the options. So perhaps the correct formula is Δλ = (λ^2 * Δf) / c.

Wait, let me double-check the formula. When you modulate a light source at frequency f, the resulting spectrum has a line width determined by the modulation. The formula I think is correct is Δλ ≈ λ² (Δf) / c. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's Δλ = λ * (Δf) / (c/f), but that might not make sense.

Wait, another approach: the relation between frequency and wavelength is c = λ f. If the frequency varies by Δf, then the change in wavelength Δλ is given by Δλ = λ² Δf / c. Let me confirm this.

Taking c = λ f, differentiating both sides: 0 = λ d(f) + f d(λ). So d(λ) = -λ d(f) / f.

So the change in wavelength d(λ) is approximately λ * d(f) / f. But if the modulation is at frequency f, then the maximum d(f) would be f, because the modulation adds and subtracts f from the central frequency. So the total spread in frequency is 2f (from -f to +f around the central frequency). Wait, no, the modulation frequency is f, so the sidebands are at f ± central frequency. So perhaps the frequency spread is 2f, leading to a change in λ of Δλ = λ * (2f) / (c/f), but that seems off.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the uncertainty principle. The time over which the light is modulated is T = 1/f. The uncertainty in time Δt is roughly T/2. The uncertainty in frequency Δf is about 1/Δt = 2f. Then, the uncertainty in wavelength Δλ is (λ / f) * Δf = (λ / f) * 2f = 2λ. That can't be right because that would give a Δλ of 1040 nm, which is way bigger than the options.

Hmm, I must be getting the formula wrong. Let me look for another approach.

I remember that in such cases, the bandwidth in terms of frequency is approximately twice the chopping frequency. So the frequency bandwidth Δf ≈ 2f. Then, to find the corresponding wavelength bandwidth Δλ, we can use the relation between frequency and wavelength.

But wait, the central frequency is f0 = c / λ0, where λ0 is 520 nm. The modulation introduces a spread of Δf = 2f (40 MHz), so the total frequency range is from f0 - f to f0 + f. The corresponding wavelengths would be λ = c/f for each frequency. So the change in wavelength would be Δλ = λ_low - λ_high.

Wait, let's compute λ_high and λ_low.

f_high = f0 + f = (c/λ0) + f

λ_high = c / (f0 + f) = c / [ (c/λ0) + f ) ] 

Similarly, λ_low = c / (f0 - f) = c / [ (c/λ0) - f ) ]

So the difference Δλ = λ_high - λ_low.

But wait, since f is much smaller than f0, we can approximate this using a Taylor expansion.

Let me write f0 = c/λ0.

So, for small f compared to f0, we can approximate λ_high ≈ λ0 * [1 - (f λ0)/c ]

Similarly, λ_low ≈ λ0 * [1 + (f λ0)/c ]

So the difference Δλ ≈ λ_high - λ_low ≈ λ0 [ (1 - (f λ0)/c ) - (1 + (f λ0)/c ) ] = λ0 [ -2 (f λ0)/c ] = -2 λ0² f / c

The magnitude would be Δλ ≈ 2 λ0² f / c.

Wait, that makes sense. So the bandwidth is twice λ0 squared times the modulation frequency divided by c.

Plugging in the numbers:

λ0 = 520 nm = 520e-9 m

f = 40e6 Hz

c = 3e8 m/s

Δλ = 2 * (520e-9 m)^2 * (40e6 Hz) / (3e8 m/s)

Compute numerator: 2 * (520e-9)^2 * 40e6

First, 520e-9 squared is (520)^2 * 1e-18 = 270400e-18 = 2.704e-13 m².

Multiply by 2: 5.408e-13.

Multiply by 40e6: 5.408e-13 * 4e7 = 2.1632e-5 m²/s.

Divide by c=3e8 m/s: 2.1632e-5 / 3e8 = 7.2106e-14 m.

Convert to nm: 7.2106e-14 m = 7.2106e-5 nm.

So Δλ ≈ 7.2e-5 nm.

Looking at the options, option F is 8 ×10^-5 nm, which is 0.00008 nm. Hmm, 7.2e-5 is close to 7e-5, but the closest option is F, which is 8e-5. Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, let me recalculate the steps more accurately.

Compute (520e-9)^2 = (520)^2 * (1e-9)^2 = 270400 * 1e-18 = 2.704e-13 m².

Multiply by 2: 5.408e-13.

Multiply by 40e6: 5.408e-13 * 4e7 = (5.408 *4) * 1e-13 * 1e7 = 21.632e-6 = 2.1632e-5.

Divide by 3e8: 2.1632e-5 / 3e8 = (2.1632 / 3) * 1e-13 = 0.7210666...e-13 = 7.210666e-14 m, which is 7.210666e-5 nm.

So approximately 7.2e-5 nm. The options don't have exactly this, but option F is 8e-5 nm, which is close. However, let's check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: 6e-5

B:5e-5

C:1e-5

D:1e-4

E:2e-5

F:8e-5

G:9e-6

H:3e-5

I:4e-5

J:7e-6

So 7.2e-5 is closest to option F (8e-5) and H (3e-5). Wait, no, 7.2e-5 is 72e-6, which is larger than 8e-5 (which is 80e-6). Wait, wait, no: 7.2e-5 nm is 72e-6 nm, and 8e-5 is 80e-6 nm. So the closest is F:8e-5.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Δλ = λ^2 * (2f) / c. Because the modulation at f creates a ±f shift, so Δf = 2f. So then:

Δλ = (520e-9)^2 * (2 *40e6) / (3e8).

Compute that:

(520e-9)^2 = 2.704e-13 m².

Multiply by 80e6: 2.704e-13 * 8e7 = 2.704 *8 * 1e-6 = 21.632e-6 m²/s.

Wait, wait, 80e6 is 8e7? No, 80 million is 8e7? No, 40e6 is 4e7, so 80e6 is 8e7? Wait, 1e6 is a million, 1e7 is ten million, so 40e6 is 40 million (4e7), 80e6 is 80 million (8e7). So 2.704e-13 *8e7 = 2.704e-13 *8e7 = 2.704*8 *1e-6 = 21.632e-6 = 2.1632e-5.

Divide by 3e8: 2.1632e-5 / 3e8 = 7.210666e-14 m = 7.21e-5 nm.

Same result as before. So the answer should be approximately 7.2e-5 nm, which isn't exactly one of the options. The closest option is F:8e-5 nm. But wait, option H is 3e-5, which is smaller, and option I is 4e-5.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another approach: the time between the shutter opening and closing is T = 1/f = 2.5e-8 seconds. The uncertainty in time Δt is about T/2. The uncertainty in frequency Δf is about 1/Δt = 2f. Then, using the relation Δλ ≈ λ * (Δf) / (c/f) ?

Wait, maybe I should use the formula Δλ = λ * (Δf) / (c/f) → Δλ = λ * (Δf * f)/c.

So Δf is 2f because the modulation is at f, leading to a spread of 2f. So Δλ = λ*(2f^2)/c.

Plugging in the numbers:

λ=520e-9 m, f=40e6 Hz.

Δλ = 520e-9 * (2*(40e6)^2) / 3e8.

Compute numerator: 2*(40e6)^2 = 2*(1.6e13) = 3.2e13.

So 520e-9 *3.2e13 = 520 *3.2e4 = 1664e4 = 1.664e6.

Divide by 3e8: 1.664e6 /3e8 = 5.546666e-3 m → 5.546666e-3 m = 5546.666 nm. That can't be right because the options are much smaller. So this approach must be wrong.

Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach. Maybe the bandwidth is just twice the product of the wavelength and the modulation frequency divided by the speed of light. So Δλ = 2 * λ * f / c.

So λ=520e-9 m, f=40e6 Hz.

Δλ = 2 *520e-9 *40e6 /3e8.

Calculate numerator: 2*520e-9*40e6 = 2*520*40e-3 = 2*520 *0.04 = 2*20.8=41.6.

Then, 41.6 /3e8 = 1.386666e-7 m = 1.386666e-1 nm, which is 0.1386 nm or 1.386e-1 nm. That's about 1.39 nm, which is way larger than the options given. So that can't be correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Δλ = λ * (Δf) / (c/f) → Δλ = λ * (Δf * f) / c.

But I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to find another way.

Wait, I think I found a formula online once that the line width due to frequency modulation is Δλ ≈ λ² * (Δf) / c.

So using that formula again:

Δλ = (520e-9 m)^2 *40e6 Hz /3e8 m/s.

Compute:

(520e-9)^2 = 2.704e-13 m².

Multiply by 40e6: 2.704e-13 *4e7 = 1.0816e-5 m²/s.

Divide by 3e8: 1.0816e-5 /3e8 = 3.6053e-14 m = 3.6053e-5 nm, which is approximately 3.6e-5 nm.

Looking at the options, option H is 3 ×10^-5 nm. That's very close. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the formula because the correct approach gives 3.6e-5, which matches option H.

Wait, but earlier when I considered the Δf as 2f, I got 7.2e-5. But with Δf as f, I get 3.6e-5. Which is correct?

I think the correct approach is to consider that the modulation frequency f introduces a spread of ±f in the frequency, so the total Δf is 2f. But in the formula I used later, I think I forgot to include the factor of 2. Let me redo that.

So Δλ = (λ^2 * 2f) / c.

Plugging in the numbers:

(520e-9)^2 = 2.704e-13 m².

Multiply by 2*40e6=80e6: 2.704e-13 *8e7 = 2.704e-13 *8e7 = 2.704*8 *1e-6 = 21.632e-6 = 2.1632e-5 m²/s.

Divide by 3e8: 2.1632e-5 /3e8 = 7.210666e-14 m = 7.210666e-5 nm.

So that's about 7.2e-5 nm, which would correspond to option F:8e-5 nm.

Wait, but earlier I thought the formula was Δλ = λ^2 * Δf / c, where Δf is the total spread, which is 2f. So that gives 7.2e-5 nm.

But when I thought of it as modulating at f, leading to Δf=2f, then the correct approach would be to use Δf=2f. So the correct Δλ is 7.2e-5 nm, which is option F.

But earlier when I used the formula without the factor of 2, I got 3.6e-5, which is option H. So which is correct?

I think the confusion comes from whether the modulation introduces a spread of Δf=2f or Δf=f. I think the correct approach is that the modulation at frequency f creates sidebands at +f and -f around the central frequency, so the total frequency spread is 2f. Therefore, the correct formula should include the factor of 2.

So the correct Δλ is 7.2e-5 nm, which is closest to option F:8e-5 nm.

But wait, looking at the options, option F is 8e-5, which is 0.00008 nm, and option H is 3e-5, which is 0.00003 nm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation again. Let me recalculate:

λ = 520e-9 m.

f =40e6 Hz.

c=3e8 m/s.

Δλ = (λ^2 * 2f) / c.

Compute:

λ^2 = (520e-9)^2 = (520)^2 * 1e-18 = 270400e-18 = 2.704e-13 m².

Multiply by 2f: 2*40e6=80e6=8e7.

So 2.704e-13 *8e7 = 2.704e-13 *8e7 = (2.704 *8) *1e-6 = 21.632e-6 = 2.1632e-5.

Divide by c=3e8: 2.1632e-5 /3e8 = 7.2106e-14 m =7.2106e-5 nm.

So 7.21e-5 nm is approximately 7.2e-5 nm. The options are:

F:8e-5 nm

H:3e-5 nm

7.2e-5 is closer to 7e-5, but there's no such option. The closest higher option is F:8e-5, and the lower is H:3e-5.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check another approach. The relation between frequency and wavelength is c=λ f. The modulation at frequency f will cause the light to have a frequency modulation, leading to a spectrum with a certain bandwidth. The bandwidth in terms of frequency is about 2f. To find the corresponding wavelength spread, we can use the derivative.

The derivative of λ with respect to f is dλ/df = -λ² / (c).

So the change in wavelength Δλ ≈ |dλ/df| * Δf = (λ² / c) * Δf.

Since Δf is 2f, Δλ = (λ² / c) * 2f.

So that's the same as before, leading to 7.2e-5 nm.

Since this isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the full width at half maximum (FWHM), which might be different, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Δλ ≈ λ * (Δf) / (c/f). Let me compute that.

Δλ = λ * (2f) / (c/f) ) = λ * (2f²) / c.

So plugging in the numbers:

λ=520e-9 m, f=40e6 Hz.

2f² = 2*(40e6)^2 = 2*(1.6e13) = 3.2e13.

So Δλ = (520e-9) * (3.2e13) / (3e8).

Compute numerator: 520e-9 *3.2e13 = 520 *3.2e4 = 1664e4 = 1.664e7.

Divide by 3e8: 1.664e7 /3e8 = 5.546666e-2 m → 5.546666e-2 m is 55.46666 mm, which is way too big. So that can't be right.

I think I'm stuck between two possible approaches: one gives 7.2e-5 nm (option F) and another gives 3.6e-5 nm (option H). I'm not sure which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Δλ ≈ λ * (Δf) / f0, where f0 is the central frequency.

f0 = c/λ0 =3e8 /520e-9 ≈ 5.769e14 Hz.

Δf=2f=80e6=8e7 Hz.

So Δλ = (520e-9 m) * (8e7) / (5.769e14) ≈ 520e-9 *8e7 /5.769e14.

Compute numerator:520e-9 *8e7=520*8e-2=41.6e-2=0.416.

Divide by 5.769e14: 0.416 /5.769e14 ≈ 7.21e-15 m=7.21e-6 nm. That's 7.21e-6 nm, which would be 7.21e-6 nm. Looking at the options, option J is 7e-6 nm, which is very close.

Wait, that's a different result. So using Δλ = λ * Δf / f0, I get approximately 7.2e-6 nm, which is option J:7 ×10^-6 nm.

Hmm, that's 7.2e-6, which is 0.0072 nm, or 7.2 angstroms (since 1 nm=10 angstroms). But the options are in A°, wait no, the question asks for the bandwidth in A°, but the options are in nm. Wait, no, the question says "bandwidth (in A°)" but the options are in nm. Wait, let me check the question again.

Wait, no, the question says "determine the bandwidth (in A°) of the resulting light." But the options are labeled as A through J, with values like 6 ×10^-5 nm. Wait, that can't be right. Did I misread the question? Let me check.

Ah, no, the options are in nm. The question asks for the bandwidth in A°, but the options are in nm. Hmm, that seems conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, and the options are in nm, but the answer needs to be in A°. Let me compute in A°.

1 A° = 0.1 nm. So if the bandwidth is 7.2e-5 nm, that's 7.2e-4 A°, which is 0.00072 A°, which seems very small. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion.

Wait, let me clarify: 1 nm = 10 A°, so 1 A° = 0.1 nm.

If the bandwidth is 7.2e-5 nm, then in A°, that's 7.2e-5 nm *10 = 7.2e-4 A°, which is 0.00072 A°, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, if the bandwidth is 7.2e-6 nm, that's 7.2e-5 A°, which is also very small.

Wait, perhaps the question meant the bandwidth in nm, not A°, because the options are in nm. Maybe it's a typo, and the answer should be in nm. So going back, the correct calculation gives 7.2e-5 nm, which is closest to option F:8e-5 nm.

But I'm getting conflicting results based on different formulas. I think the correct approach is to use the formula Δλ = (λ^2 * 2f)/c, which gives 7.2e-5 nm. So the answer should be option F:8 ×10^-5 nm.
</think>

To determine the bandwidth of the resulting light, we analyze the modulation caused by the shutter. The modulation frequency is 40 MHz, and the central wavelength is 520 nm. The relationship between the modulation frequency and the bandwidth is derived using the formula:

\[
\Delta \lambda = \frac{2 \lambda^2 f}{c}
\]

where:
- \( \lambda = 520 \, \text{nm} = 520 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \),
- \( f = 40 \, \text{MHz} = 40 \times 10^6 \, \text{Hz} \),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).

### Calculation:
1. Compute \( \lambda^2 \):
   \[
   \lambda^2 = (520 \times 10^{-9})^2 = 270400 \times 10^{-18} = 2.704 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{m}^2
   \]

2. Multiply by \( 2f \):
   \[
   2f = 2 \times 40 \times 10^6 = 80 \times 10^6 = 8 \times 10^7 \, \text{Hz}
   \]
   \[
   \lambda^2 \cdot 2f = 2.704 \times 10^{-13} \cdot 8 \times 10^7 = 2.1632 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}
   \]

3. Divide by \( c \):
   \[
   \Delta \lambda = \frac{2.1632 \times 10^{-5}}{3 \times 10^8} = 7.2106 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{m} = 7.2106 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{nm}
   \]

### Comparison with Options:
The calculated bandwidth is approximately \( 7.2 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{nm} \). Among the given options, the closest match is:

**F: \( 8 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{nm} \)**.

ANSWER: F
