Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

IfDNAaseis added to a bacterial cell, the DNA is hydrolyzed , the cell cannot make any more proteins and eventually dies. IfDNAaseis added to RNA viruses, they continue to produce new proteins. Explain.

Options:

A: The virus uses a different enzyme to replicate its genetic material
B: The virus has a unique replication cycle that does not involve nucleic acids
C: The virus is immune to DNAase
D: The virus contains RNA, it is not affected by DNAase
E: DNAase selectively only attacks bacterial DNA
F: The virus's genetic material is composed of proteins, not nucleic acids
G: The virus rapidly mutates to resist the effects of DNAase
H: The RNA in the virus is transformed into DNA
I: The virus has a protective shell against DNAase
J: The virus encodes its own DNAase inhibitor proteins

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this biology question. Let me read it again carefully. The question says that when DNAase is added to a bacterial cell, the DNA is hydrolyzed, the cell can't make more proteins, and eventually dies. But when DNAase is added to RNA viruses, they continue to produce new proteins. I need to explain why that happens and choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that DNAase is an enzyme that breaks down DNA. So when it's added to a bacterial cell, it digests the bacterial DNA. Since DNA is the genetic material, without it, the bacteria can't make proteins because they can't transcribe mRNA from DNA. That makes the bacteria unable to function and die. That part I get.

Now, for the RNA viruses: why don't they stop making proteins when DNAase is added? Well, RNA viruses have RNA as their genetic material, not DNA. So DNAase, which specifically targets DNA, shouldn't affect the RNA. Therefore, the virus can still use its RNA to make proteins. But wait, I should think about the replication cycles of these viruses.

Wait, do RNA viruses need to make DNA at some point? Some do, like retroviruses which use reverse transcriptase to make DNA from RNA. But the question says that when DNAase is added, the viruses still produce proteins. So maybe the virus in question doesn't rely on DNA replication.

Let me consider the options:

Option A: The virus uses a different enzyme to replicate its genetic material. That could be true, like reverse transcriptase, but does that explain why DNAase doesn't affect them? Not exactly, because even if they use a different enzyme, their DNA (if present) would be attacked by DNAase. But if the virus doesn't have DNA, then DNAase can't act on it.

Option D says the virus contains RNA, not DNA, so it's not affected by DNAase. That makes sense because DNAase targets DNA, not RNA. So the virus's genetic material is RNA, so adding DNAase won't break it down. Therefore, the virus can still produce proteins from its RNA.

Other options: E says DNAase only attacks bacterial DNA. No, DNAase attacks DNA wherever it is, so that's not right. C says the virus is immune, but that's vague. F says the genetic material is proteins; no, viruses have nucleic acids. G is about mutation, which isn't relevant here. H says RNA transforms into DNA, but that's in retroviruses, and the question says the virus continues to produce proteins, implying they don't need DNA. I says a protective shell, but DNAase can probably get through. J says the virus has an inhibitor, but the question doesn't mention that.

So the correct answer should be D: The virus contains RNA, it is not affected by DNAase.

The correct answer is D: The virus contains RNA, it is not affected by DNAase.

DNAase specifically targets DNA, breaking it down. Bacteria, which use DNA as their genetic material, are affected, leading to their death. RNA viruses, however, use RNA as their genetic material. Since DNAase does not act on RNA, the virus's genetic material remains intact, allowing it to continue producing proteins. 

Answer: D
