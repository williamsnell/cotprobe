Okay, so I've got this question here about calories in ice cream. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that 4 ounces of this ice cream have 230 calories. They're asking how many calories are in 6 ounces of the same type. Hmm, so I think this is a proportion problem because the calories should be directly proportional to the amount of ice cream.

First, I need to find out how many calories are in one ounce. If 4 ounces equal 230 calories, then one ounce would be 230 divided by 4. Let me do that calculation: 230 รท 4 equals... let's see, 4 times 50 is 200, and 4 times 7 is 28, so 57 times 4 is 228. Wait, that's not exact. Oh right, 230 รท 4 is actually 57.5 calories per ounce. Yeah, because 4 times 57 is 228, and then 2 more would make 230, so that's 57.5.

Now that I know each ounce is 57.5 calories, I can find out what 6 ounces would be. So I multiply 57.5 by 6. Let me calculate that. 57 times 6 is 342, and 0.5 times 6 is 3, so adding those together gives 345 calories. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 345 as one of the choices. Wait, let me check the options again. Oh, option H is 345. So that should be the answer.

Wait a second, maybe I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So 4 ounces is 230 calories. So per ounce is 230/4 = 57.5. Then 6 ounces would be 57.5 * 6. Let me compute that again. 57 * 6 is 342, and 0.5 *6 is 3, so total is 345. Yep, that seems right. So the answer should be H: 345.

The question involves calculating the number of calories in 6 ounces of ice cream when 4 ounces contain 230 calories. 

1. **Find calories per ounce**:  
   \( \frac{230 \text{ calories}}{4 \text{ ounces}} = 57.5 \text{ calories per ounce} \)

2. **Calculate calories for 6 ounces**:  
   \( 57.5 \text{ calories/ounce} \times 6 \text{ ounces} = 345 \text{ calories} \)

3. **Verify the answer**:  
   The calculation confirms that 6 ounces of ice cream contain 345 calories, which corresponds to option **H**.

Answer: H
