Options:

A: F1 generation are all tall and green. The F2 generation will have 1/2 tall and green, 1/4 tall and yellow, 1/4 dwarf and green.
B: F1 generation are all tall and green. The F2 generation will have 9/16 tall and green, 3/16 tall and yellow, 3/16 dwarf and green, 1/16 dwarf and yellow.

D: F1 generation are all tall and green. The F2 generation will have 9/16 dwarf and green, 3/16 dwarf and yellow, 3/16 tall and green, 1/16 tall and yellow.
E: F1 generation are all tall and yellow. The F2 generation will have 3/4 tall and yellow, 1/4 dwarf and green.
F: F1 generation are all dwarf and yellow. The F2 generation will have 9/16 dwarf and yellow, 3/16 dwarf and green, 3/16 tall and yellow, 1/16 tall and green.
G: F1 generation are all tall and yellow. The F2 generation will have 1/2 tall and yellow, 1/4 tall and green, 1/4 dwarf and yellow.
H: F1 generation are all dwarf and yellow. The F2 generation will have 9/16 tall and yellow, 3/16 dwarf and yellow, 3/16 tall and green, 1/16 dwarf and green.
I: F1 generation are all tall and yellow. The F2 generation will have 9/16 tall and yellow, 3/16 tall and green, 3/16 dwarf and yellow, 1/16 dwarf and green.
J: F1 generation are all dwarf and green. The F2 generation will have 9/16 dwarf and green, 3/16 dwarf and yellow, 3/16 tall and green, 1/16 tall and yellow.

Okay, so I have this genetics problem here about peas. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I remember that in peas, the traits are usually inherited in a Mendelian fashion, so I'll need to apply some basic principles of Mendelian genetics.

The question says: In peas, tall (D) is dominant to dwarf (d) and yellow cotyledons (G) is dominant to green (g). So, the two traits here are height and cotyledon color. Both are independent, I assume, since the problem doesn't mention any linkage issues.

We're crossing a tall, homozygous, yellow pea plant with a dwarf, green pea plant. Let's break down the parents' genotypes. 

First, the tall, homozygous yellow plant. Since tall is dominant (D) and yellow is dominant (G), and it's homozygous, that means it's DD for the height gene. For the cotyledon color, being yellow and homozygous would be GG. So its genotype is DDGG.

The other parent is a dwarf, green plant. Dwarf is recessive, so the genotype would be dd for height. Green cotyledons are recessive, so that's gg. So the genotype is ddgg.

Now, when we cross these two plants, what happens? Let's consider each trait separately first.

Starting with the height: DD (tall) crossed with dd (dwarf). Since DD is homozygous dominant, all the offspring will inherit D from this parent and d from the other. So the F1 generation will all be Dd for height, which means they'll all be tall.

For the cotyledon color: GG (yellow) crossed with gg (green). Similarly, the F1 will get G from one parent and g from the other, so they'll all be Gg. Since G is dominant, all F1 plants will have yellow cotyledons.

So the F1 generation will all be tall and yellow, with the genotype DdGg. Wait, but wait, looking at the options, some say F1 are all tall and green. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Wait, noâ€”GG crossed with gg, F1 is Gg, which is yellow. So the F1 should be tall (since they're Dd) and yellow (Gg). So looking at the options, I need to see which ones have F1 as tall and yellow.

Wait, the options are A through J. Let me check each one.

Option I says F1 are all tall and yellow, which fits what I'm thinking. So I'll keep that in mind. Let's proceed to the F2 generation.

To get F2, we need to self-pollinate the F1 plants (DdGg). Each F1 plant will produce gametes by independent assortment. Since DdGg is a dihybrid, each gamete will have one allele for each gene. The possible gametes are DG, Dg, dG, dg. Each gamete has a 25% chance.

When we self-pollinate, the F2 generation will result from the combination of these gametes. Alternatively, we can use a Punnett square for each trait and then combine them because the traits are independent.

Let's first consider the height (D and d) in the F2. Dd selfed (Dd x Dd) gives a 25% DD, 50% Dd, 25% dd. The phenotypes are tall for DD and Dd (75% tall), and dwarf for dd (25% dwarf).

For the cotyledon color (G and g), Gg selfed (Gg x Gg) gives 25% GG, 50% Gg, 25% gg. Phenotypes are yellow for GG and Gg (75% yellow), and green for gg (25% green).

Since the traits are independent, we can multiply the probabilities for each phenotype combination.

So the possible phenotypic ratios are:

Tall and Yellow: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16

Tall and Green: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16

Dwarf and Yellow: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16

Dwarf and Green: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16

So the F2 generation has 9 tall yellow, 3 tall green, 3 dwarf yellow, and 1 dwarf green.

Now, looking back at the options, which one matches this?

Option I says: F1 are all tall and yellow. F2 will have 9/16 tall and yellow, 3/16 tall and green, 3/16 dwarf and yellow, 1/16 dwarf and green. That's exactly what I just calculated.

Wait, but let me check option I again. The user presented the options, and I need to make sure. Looking at the options:

Option I: F1 are tall and yellow. F2 is 9/16 tall yellow, 3/16 tall green, 3/16 dwarf yellow, 1/16 dwarf green. Yep, that's correct.

Wait, but I thought the F1 would be all tall and yellow, but looking at the initial cross again: DDGG x ddgg. So F1 is DdGg, which is tall and yellow. So F1 is all tall and yellow. Then F2 is the dihybrid self as above.

So the correct answer should be option I.

The correct answer is I. The F1 generation will all be tall and yellow, and the F2 generation will have a phenotypic ratio of 9/16 tall and yellow, 3/16 tall and green, 3/16 dwarf and yellow, and 1/16 dwarf and green.
