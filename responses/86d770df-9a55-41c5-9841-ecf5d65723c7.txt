Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the diameter of the bolts for this coupling. Hmm, let's see. The problem says it's a cast-iron flanged coupling joining two steel shafts. The shafts are 2.5 inches in diameter, and they deliver a maximum torque of 60 foot-pounds. The coupling uses 4 bolts arranged equidistant on a bolt circle with a diameter of 3 inches. The design stress is 10,000 psi in shear for the bolts. I need to find the diameter of each bolt.

First, I remember that when bolts are used to connect two parts, the torque applied is transmitted through the bolts. But wait, torque is a rotational force, so I think I need to calculate the shear force on each bolt.

Since there are 4 bolts equally spaced, the torque would be distributed equally among them. So each bolt would handle a portion of the total torque. Let me calculate the torque per bolt.

Total torque is 60 ft-lb. There are 4 bolts, so each bolt would carry 60 / 4 = 15 ft-lb of torque.

Wait, but torque is a measure of force times distance. To find the shear force, I think I need to find the force each bolt must apply to resist the torque. Maybe I should consider the relationship between torque, force, and the radius of the bolt circle.

The bolts are on a circle with a diameter of 3 inches, so the radius is 1.5 inches. Torque (T) is equal to the force (F) multiplied by the radius (r), so T = F * r. But wait, in this case, each bolt's force contributes to the overall torque. Or maybe I'm mixing up the concepts here.

Wait, each bolt has to provide a force that, when multiplied by the radius, equals the torque it's handling. So for each bolt, the torque it must handle is Tbolt = Fbolt * rbolt.

So Fbolt = Tbolt / rbolt. But Tbolt here is the torque each bolt must handle, which I calculated as 15 ft-lb. Wait, but 15 ft-lb is a torque, not a force. So I think I need to convert this into force.

Wait, no. The formula T = F * r applies when F is the force applied tangentially. But in the case of bolts, the force is applied axially, but the torque is due to the shear force at the point where the two flanges meet. Hmm, maybe I should think about it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the shear force on each bolt and then relate that to the shear stress. The shear stress is given as 10,000 psi, so I can use that to find the required area, and then the diameter.

Wait, each bolt experiences a shear force. Since the torque is transmitted through the bolts, the total shear force from all bolts must equal the torque divided by the radius of the circle where the force is applied. Wait, that might be the right approach.

Wait, the formula for torque when considering the shear force in a coupling is T = F_avg * r, where F_avg is the average shear force per bolt multiplied by the number of bolts. So F_avg would be the force per bolt, right?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The total torque T is equal to the sum of the torques provided by each bolt. Each bolt's torque contribution is Fbolt * rbolt, so total T = sum(Fbolt * rbolt) for each bolt. Since all bolts are identical, Fbolt is same for each. So T = n * Fbolt * rbolt, where n is the number of bolts.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you have a torque applied, the shear force in each bolt is such that the torque each bolt provides is Fbolt * rbolt. So total torque is the sum of each bolt's torque contribution.

So T_total = n * Fbolt * rbolt. Therefore, Fbolt = T_total / (n * rbolt).

But wait, in this case, the torque per bolt is Tbolt = Fbolt * rbolt, so total T = sum(Tbolt) = n * Fbolt * rbolt.

So Fbolt = T_total / (n * rbolt).

Plugging in the numbers: T_total is 60 ft-lb, n is 4, rbolt is 1.5 inches.

Wait, but units need to be consistent. Let me make sure.

So Fbolt = 60 / (4 * 1.5) = 60 / 6 = 10 lb. So each bolt must handle 10 pounds of force.

Wait, but that seems low. Let me check again. 60 ft-lb divided by 4 bolts is 15 ft-lb per bolt. Then, 15 ft-lb per bolt divided by 1.5 inches gives 10 pounds. Yeah, that seems right.

Now, the shear stress in the bolt is given as 10,000 psi. Shear stress (τ) is force (F) divided by the area (A), so τ = F / A.

We can rearrange this to find A = F / τ.

The force per bolt is 10 pounds, and τ is 10,000 psi. So A = 10 / 10,000 = 0.001 in².

Now, the area of a circle is A = π * (d/2)^2. Let me solve for diameter d.

A = π (d² /4) = (π d²)/4. So d² = (4A)/π.

Plugging in A = 0.001 in²:

d² = (4 * 0.001) / π ≈ 0.004 / 3.1416 ≈ 0.001273.

Taking square root: d ≈ sqrt(0.001273) ≈ 0.03568 inches. Wait, that can't be right. That's way too small for a bolt diameter. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait a minute, I think I messed up the units. Because 10 pounds force over 10,000 psi gives area in square inches. Let me double-check the calculations.

So Fbolt is 10 lb, and τ is 10,000 psi.

A = F / τ = 10 / 10,000 = 0.001 in².

Yes, that's correct. So the area is 0.001 in². Now, solving for diameter:

A = π (d^2)/4 = 0.001.

So d^2 = (0.001 * 4)/π = 0.004 / 3.1416 ≈ 0.001273.

d ≈ sqrt(0.001273) ≈ 0.03568 inches.

Wait, that's about 0.0357 inches, which is approximately 0.0357 in. But looking at the options, the smallest diameter is around 0.12 inches. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the total force on all bolts together, not per bolt. Let me think again.

The torque is 60 ft-lb, and the radius is 1.5 inches. So the total shear force F_total is T / r = 60 / 1.5 = 40 lb.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because torque T = F * r, so F = T / r.

So total shear force F_total is 40 lb. Since there are 4 bolts, each bolt's shear force is 40 / 4 = 10 lb, which matches my earlier calculation. So that part seems correct.

Then, each bolt's shear area is A = F / τ = 10 / 10,000 = 0.001 in².

Hmm, that leads to a diameter of around 0.0357 in, which doesn't match any of the options. So I must have a wrong approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing shear force with the torque. Maybe I should consider the shear stress due to the torque in the bolts differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the required number of bolts based on torque and shear stress. Let me look for another approach.

Another way is to calculate the required shear force for each bolt and then relate that to the shear stress and the area of the bolt.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that I'm using the wrong radius. The radius for the torque calculation is the radius of the bolt circle, which is 1.5 inches. But when calculating the shear force per bolt, each bolt is at that radius, so Fbolt = Tbolt / rbolt.

Wait, but Tbolt is the torque that each bolt must handle. So each bolt's torque is Tbolt = (T_total) / n = 60 /4 = 15 ft-lb.

Then, Fbolt = Tbolt / rbolt = 15 / 1.5 = 10 lb. So each bolt must handle 10 lb of force.

Then, shear stress τ = Fbolt / A.

So A = Fbolt / τ = 10 / 10,000 = 0.001 in².

Area of the bolt circle: A = π (d^2)/4. So solving for d:

d^2 = (4A)/π = (4 * 0.001)/3.1416 ≈ 0.004 / 3.1416 ≈ 0.001273.

d ≈ sqrt(0.001273) ≈ 0.0357 in.

But this is way too small. The options are all around 0.12 in. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I'm misapplying the shear stress. Because in a bolt, the shear stress is the force divided by the area over which the force is applied. For a bolt, the shear area would typically be the area of the cross-section, which is π*(d^2)/4.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider that when the torque is applied, the bolts are in shear, and the shear stress is calculated based on the area. So maybe I should use the formula for shear stress in a circular cross-section.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the shear modulus or use the torsion formula, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The maximum shear stress in a bolt due to torque can be found using the formula τ = (T * r) / (n * A), where T is the torque, r is the radius, n is the number of bolts, and A is the area of each bolt.

Wait, rearranging that, A = (T * r) / (n * τ).

So A = (60 ft-lb * 1.5 in) / (4 * 10,000 psi).

But wait, units here are inconsistent. Let me convert everything to consistent units.

1 ft = 12 inches, so 60 ft-lb = 60 * 12 = 720 in-lb.

So T = 720 in-lb, r = 1.5 in.

So A = (720 * 1.5) / (4 * 10,000) = (1080) / (40,000) = 0.027 in².

Wait, that's different. So A = 0.027 in².

Now, solving for d:

A = π (d²)/4 → d² = (4A)/π = (4 * 0.027)/3.1416 ≈ 0.108 / 3.1416 ≈ 0.03437.

d ≈ sqrt(0.03437) ≈ 0.1853 inches. Hmm, still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is τ = (T * r) / (n * A), so A = (T * r) / (n * τ).

But let me plug in the numbers again.

T is 60 ft-lb, which is 60 * 12 = 720 in-lb.

r is 1.5 in.

n is 4.

τ is 10,000 psi.

So A = (720 * 1.5) / (4 * 10,000) = (1080) / 40,000 = 0.027 in².

Yes, that's correct. So d^2 = (4 * 0.027) / π ≈ 0.108 / 3.1416 ≈ 0.03437.

d ≈ 0.1853 in. But the options don't have anything close to 0.185 in. The options are around 0.12 in. So I must be making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the radius. The problem says the bolt circle has a diameter of 3 inches, so the radius is 1.5 in. But when considering the shear area of the bolt, the radius is the same as the radius of the bolt's cross-section, which for a diameter d is d/2. Wait, no, the shear area is the cross-sectional area of the bolt, which is π*(d/2)^2.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about the shear force on each bolt. Each bolt must transmit 15 ft-lb of torque. The shear stress in the bolt is 10,000 psi, so the area of the bolt must be sufficient to handle that stress with the force from the torque.

Wait, perhaps the shear force F is related to torque by F = torque / radius. So Fbolt = 15 ft-lb / 1.5 in = 10 lb, as before.

Then, shear stress τ = F / A → A = F / τ = 10 lb / 10,000 psi = 0.001 in².

Then, the diameter d is sqrt(4A/π) = sqrt(4*0.001/3.1416) ≈ sqrt(0.00127) ≈ 0.0357 in. That's way too small, so I must have messed up.

Wait, perhaps the shear force isn't 10 lb per bolt. Maybe I should consider the entire torque and the way it's distributed.

Wait, I think the confusion is between the torque transmitted by each bolt and the shear force. Let me clarify.

When a torque T is applied to a coupling, the shear force F in each bolt is given by F = T / (r * n), where r is the radius of the bolt circle and n is the number of bolts.

So F = 60 ft-lb / (1.5 in * 4) = 60 / 6 = 10 lb per bolt. That's the same as before.

Then, shear stress τ = F / A → A = F / τ = 10 / 10,000 = 0.001 in².

So the area is 0.001 in², which gives a diameter of about 0.0357 in. But that's not an option. So I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect. Maybe the shear stress isn't F / A. Or perhaps the shear force per bolt is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the shear modulus or use the torsion formula for the shaft, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm going to try a different approach. Maybe the shear force per bolt is T * r / n, where T is torque, r is radius, and n is number of bolts.

So F = (60 ft-lb * 1.5 in) / (4) = (90) /4 = 22.5 lb. Wait, no, that can't be right because 60 ft-lb is 720 in-lb. So 720 * 1.5 = 1080 in²-lb. Divided by 4 gives 270 in²-lb per bolt. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula for torque in terms of shear force: T = F * r. So F = T / r.

But for each bolt, Tbolt is the torque each handles, which is T_total / n = 60/4 = 15 ft-lb = 180 in-lb.

So Fbolt = 180 in-lb / 1.5 in = 120 lb.

Wait, that's different. So each bolt must handle 120 lb of force.

Then, shear stress τ = F / A → A = F / τ = 120 / 10,000 = 0.012 in².

Then, area A = π*(d²)/4 → d² = (4A)/π = (4*0.012)/3.1416 ≈ 0.048 / 3.1416 ≈ 0.01527 → d ≈ sqrt(0.01527) ≈ 0.1236 in.

Ah! That's one of the options. Option F is 0.1236 in.

Wait, that makes sense. So earlier, I think I made a mistake in the unit conversion for torque. Let me recheck.

Total torque is 60 ft-lb, which is 60 * 12 = 720 in-lb.

Each bolt handles 720 /4 = 180 in-lb.

So Fbolt = 180 / 1.5 = 120 lb.

Then, shear area A = 120 / 10,000 = 0.012 in².

Calculating diameter: d = sqrt( (4*A)/π ) = sqrt( (4*0.012)/3.1416 ) = sqrt(0.048 /3.1416) = sqrt(0.01527) ≈ 0.1236 in.

So the correct diameter is approximately 0.1236 inches, which is option F.
</think>

To determine the diameter of the bolts, we start by calculating the shear force on each bolt. The total torque is 60 ft-lb, which is equivalent to 720 in-lb. Since there are 4 bolts, each bolt handles an equal share of the torque:

\[
T_{\text{bolt}} = \frac{720 \, \text{in-lb}}{4} = 180 \, \text{in-lb}.
\]

The shear force on each bolt is then calculated using the formula \( F = \frac{T}{r} \), where \( r = 1.5 \, \text{in} \):

\[
F_{\text{bolt}} = \frac{180 \, \text{in-lb}}{1.5 \, \text{in}} = 120 \, \text{lb}.
\]

Next, we use the shear stress formula \( \tau = \frac{F}{A} \), where \( \tau = 10,000 \, \text{psi} \). Rearranging for the area \( A \):

\[
A = \frac{F}{\tau} = \frac{120 \, \text{lb}}{10,000 \, \text{psi}} = 0.012 \, \text{in}^2.
\]

The area of a circle is \( A = \frac{\pi d^2}{4} \). Solving for the diameter \( d \):

\[
d^2 = \frac{4A}{\pi} = \frac{4 \times 0.012}{3.1416} \approx 0.01527,
\]
\[
d \approx \sqrt{0.01527} \approx 0.1236 \, \text{in}.
\]

Thus, the diameter of the bolts is approximately **0.1236 inches**, which corresponds to option **F**.

**Answer: F**
