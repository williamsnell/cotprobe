Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Singer's argument and how it upsets a traditional distinction. I'm a bit rusty on Singer's work, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Peter Singer is a philosopher known for his work in ethics, particularly his arguments about animal rights and utilitarianism. One of his key ideas is that the way we distinguish between different ethical concepts might not hold up under scrutiny.

The question is asking which traditional distinction Singer's argument upsets. The options are from A to J, each pairing different ethical or moral concepts.

Let me go through each option:

A: fairness and bias. Hmm, I'm not sure Singer directly challenges fairness vs bias. Maybe, but I don't recall that being his main focus.

B: ethical and unethical. That seems too broad. Singer might discuss what's ethical, but I don't think he's out to blur that line entirely.

C: duty and charity. Duty relates to obligations, while charity is more about kindness. I'm not sure if Singer challenges this distinction, but maybe in his discussions about moral duties.

D: positive and negative rights. This sounds more like a rights-based distinction. Singer might talk about rights, but I'm not sure if this is the one he upsets.

E: freedom and restriction. Maybe, but I don't think this is the primary target of his arguments.

F: obligation and option. Obligation is about duties, option about choices. Not sure if this is it.

G: justice and injustice. Singer does talk a lot about justice, especially in his work on animal rights. But does he upset this distinction? Maybe, but I'm not certain.

H: moral and amoral. That's a big distinction. Singer might discuss what's moral, but I don't think he argues against this line.

I: egoism and altruism. These are about self-interest vs others. I don't recall Singer focusing on this in his arguments about distinctions.

J: rights and privileges. Rights are inherent entitlements, privileges are granted. Singer might discuss this, but I'm not sure if it's the main point.

Wait, I think I remember Singer discussing the idea that there's no clear line between different kinds of rights. In his arguments, especially about animal rights, he challenges the traditional distinction between human rights and animal rights, or maybe between different types of rights. So looking back at the options, J is rights and privileges. Does he upset that?

Alternatively, another angle: in his article "The Right to Life," Singer argues against the idea that human life is inherently more valuable than other species. This challenges the traditional distinction between human and animal rights. But the options don't include that directly. The closest is J: rights and privileges.

Or, another thought: Singer might argue that the way we categorize moral distinctions is flawed. For example, in his work, he might say that the line between duty and charity isn't as clear. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's about the distinction between positive and negative rights. Positive rights require others to provide you with something, while negative rights are about freedom from interference. But I'm not sure if Singer targets this.

Alternatively, I think Singer has written about how the concept of equality is often misunderstood. But I'm not sure if that's one of the options.

Wait, another angle: Singer's argument might challenge the idea that there's a clear line between justice and injustice. He might argue that our notion of justice is based on flawed premises. But I'm not certain.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think of his main arguments. Singer is known for the "expanding circle" of ethical concern, moving beyond humans to include other animals. He also discusses the idea that the boundaries we draw in ethics are not as clear as we think.

Wait, the question says "the traditional distinction between." So perhaps Singer argues that there's no clear line between rights and privileges. For example, some things we call rights might actually be privileges, or vice versa.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the distinction between moral and amoral, but I don't think so. Or perhaps between justice and injustice, but again, not sure.

Wait, I think I remember a specific point where Singer discusses the idea that the traditional distinction between killing and letting die is not as clear. But that's not one of the options here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the distinction between positive and negative rights. If Singer argues that rights are a matter of degree, then he might be blurring that line.

Wait, the options are A to J, and the correct answer is J: rights and privileges. Because Singer argues that many things we consider rights are actually privileges, or that the distinction isn't as clear. Or perhaps he argues that the concept of rights itself is flawed and that we should focus on interests instead.

Wait, in his work, Singer is critical of the way we assign rights. For example, he challenges the idea that humans have an absolute right to life, which would upset the distinction between rights and other concepts like privileges. So, perhaps J is the right answer.

The question asks which traditional distinction Singer's argument upsets. Singer, a philosopher known for his work in ethics, often challenges conventional moral distinctions. Among the options, the distinction between "rights and privileges" (J) aligns with his arguments, particularly his critique of how we categorize rights and interests. He argues that some concepts we call rights might be better understood as privileges or that the distinction itself is not as clear as traditionally thought. This makes J the most fitting answer.

Answer: J
