Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"The conscience of the people, in a time of grave national problems, has called into being a new party, born of the nation's sense of justice. We of the Progressive party here dedicate ourselves to the fulfillment of the duty laid upon us by our fathers to maintain the government of the people, by the people and for the people whose foundations they laid. We hold with Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln that the people are the masters of their Constitution, to fulfill its purposes and to safeguard it from those who, by perversion of its intent, would convert it into an instrument of injustice. In accordance with the needs of each generation the people must use their sovereign powers to establish and maintain equal opportunity and industrial justice, to secure which this Government was founded and without which no republic can endure.
"This country belongs to the people who inhabit it. Its resources, its business, its institutions and its laws should be utilized, maintained or altered in whatever manner will best promote the general interest. It is time to set the public welfare in the first place."
Progressive Party Platform, 1912
Would the Underwood-Simmons Tariff of 1913 be generally endorsed by Progressives of that era?

Options:

A: Yes, because they were largely supporters of Teddy Roosevelt's "Square Deal"
B: Yes, because the tariff promoted industrial justice
C: No, because the tariff did not promote equal opportunity
D: No, because the tariff was seen as a perversion of the Constitution's intent
E: Yes, because most Democrats advocated lower duties
F: No, because they were largely opponents of Woodrow Wilson
G: No, because the Progressive party was against any form of taxation
H: No, because they were largely supporters of Teddy Roosevelt's "New Nationalism"

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Underwood-Simmons Tariff of 1913 would have been endorsed by Progressives in that era. Let's start by understanding the context.

From the Progressive Party Platform of 1912 provided, it emphasizes the people being the masters of their Constitution and the need for equal opportunity and industrial justice. The platform also mentions that the government should use sovereign powers to establish these things, and that the country belongs to the people, with resources, business, institutions, and laws working for the general interest.

Now, the Underwood-Simmons Tariff of 1913 was a significant piece of legislation. I recall that it was part of Woodrow Wilson's New Freedom platform, which aimed to lower tariffs, especially on raw materials, to make them more competitive. This was intended to help farmers and consumers by reducing prices on imported goods. Additionally, it introduced a graduated income tax, which was a response to the Progressive push for more equitable taxation.

Progressives in the early 20th century were generally in favor of using the government to promote social and economic reforms. They wanted to address issues like industrial exploitation, poor working conditions, and monopolistic business practices. The tariff's focus on lowering duties, particularly on items that would benefit farmers and lower-income consumers, aligns with the Progressive goals of promoting economic equality and reducing costs for everyday goods.

Looking at the options:

A: Talks about Teddy Roosevelt's "Square Deal." TR was a Progressive but his policies were different from Wilson's. The Square Deal focused on conservation, regulation of big business, and consumer protection. While related, the Underwood Tariff was more about lowering tariffs and tax reform, so maybe not the main reason Progressives supported it.

B: The tariff promoted industrial justice. That makes sense because lower tariffs on raw materials would make production cheaper, potentially leading to lower prices and better wages, which aligns with industrial justice.

C: The tariff didn't promote equal opportunity. But I think the tariff was meant to help farmers and consumers, which does promote equal opportunity, so this might not be correct.

D: Seen as a perversion of the Constitution. The platform says they support the people using their sovereign powers to fulfill the Constitution's purposes. The tariff was a legitimate use, so probably not this.

E: Democrats advocated lower duties. While the tariff was a Democratic initiative, the question is about Progressives. So maybe not the main reason.

F: Opponents of Wilson. Progressives were diverse, but many supported Wilson's progressive policies, so this seems off.

G: Against taxation. The tariff included a tax on income, which Progressives supported as a more fair way of taxation. So this is incorrect.

H: Supporters of TR's New Nationalism. New Nationalism was about strong federal regulation, but the Underwood Tariff was more about lowering tariffs and tax reform. So maybe not.

So, the key points are that the tariff aimed to lower prices for consumers and farmers, which aligns with the Progressive goals of industrial justice and economic equality. Therefore, option B seems correct.
</think>

The Underwood-Simmons Tariff of 1913, which sought to lower tariffs and introduce a graduated income tax, aligns with the Progressive platform's emphasis on promoting industrial justice and economic equality. By reducing costs for consumers and farmers, the tariff supported the Progressive goal of addressing economic disparities. Thus, the tariff would likely be endorsed by Progressives of that era.

Answer: B
