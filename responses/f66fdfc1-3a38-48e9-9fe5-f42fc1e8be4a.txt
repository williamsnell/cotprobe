Okay, so I have this question about the maximum number of edges in a simple planar graph with 30 vertices. Hmm, planar graphs... I remember that planar graphs are those that can be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula or rule for finding the maximum edges. Let me think.

Wait, I think there's a formula related to Euler's formula for planar graphs. Euler's formula is V - E + F = 2, right? Where V is vertices, E is edges, and F is faces. But I need to connect this to the maximum number of edges.

Oh right, for a simple planar graph, there's a limit on the number of edges. I believe it's something like E ≤ 3V - 6. Yeah, that rings a bell. Let me check if that's correct. So if that's the case, then for V=30, E would be 3*30 -6 = 84. So the maximum number of edges would be 84.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure if it's 3V-6 or 2V-4. No, wait, I think 3V-6 is the correct one for planar graphs without any triangles, but actually, it's a general upper limit regardless of the faces. So for any simple planar graph, E can't exceed 3V -6. Let me think about why that is.

Euler's formula: V - E + F = 2. Also, in any planar graph, each face must be bounded by at least three edges, and each edge is shared by two faces. So 3F ≤ 2E. Substituting F from Euler's formula, F = 2 + E - V. So 3(2 + E - V) ≤ 2E → 6 + 3E -3V ≤ 2E → 6 -3V ≤ -E → 3V -6 ≥ E. So yeah, E ≤ 3V -6.

So for V=30, that's 3*30=90, minus 6 is 84. So the maximum edges are 84. Looking at the options, option B is 84. So that should be the correct answer.

I think that's it. So the answer is B:84.

The maximum number of edges in a simple planar graph with 30 vertices is 84, calculated using the formula \( E \leq 3V - 6 \), where \( V = 30 \).

Answer: B
