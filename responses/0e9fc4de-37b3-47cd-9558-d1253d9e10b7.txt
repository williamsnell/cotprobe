Okay, so I need to figure out the correct answer to this accounting question about accruals and deferrals. Hmm, I remember that accrual accounting is different from cash basis accounting. Let me think about what I learned in my classes.

First, accrual accounting is about recognizing revenues and expenses when they are earned or incurred, regardless of when the cash is exchanged. So it's not just about the current cash; it's more about the future expectations.

Accruals, I think, are entries made to record transactions that have occurred but haven't been cashed yet. Like if a company provides a service but hasn't been paid yet, they'd record that as an accrued revenue. So accruals are about expecting future cash receipts. Similarly, if they've incurred an expense but haven't paid it, that's an accrued expense.

Then deferrals are a bit different. I remember that deferrals are when you receive cash but haven't yet earned the revenue or used up the expense. For example, if a company pays for a subscription upfront, they record it as a deferred expense because they haven't used it yet. So deferrals are about money received or paid now, but the actual use or earning happens later.

Wait, so let me get this straight. Accruals are about expecting future cash receipts (like when you send an invoice) and future payments (like when you owe money). Deferrals are about money you've already received but haven't earned yet (like advance payments) or paid for but haven't used yet (like prepaid expenses).

Looking at the options:

Option A says accruals are about current cash, deferrals about future. That doesn't sound right because I think accruals are about future cash receipts and payments, not current.

Option B says accruals are about future, deferrals about current. That fits because accruals are expecting future cash (like accounts receivable), and deferrals are about current cash but deferred (like unearned revenue).

Option D says both are about future cash. No, because deferrals are about current cash being deferred, not future.

Option H says accruals are future, deferrals are past. No, because deferrals aren't about past, they're about current but not yet realized.

So putting it together, the correct answer should be B: Accruals are concerned with expected future cash receipts and payments while deferrals are concerned with current cash receipts and payments.

The correct answer is B. Accruals relate to future cash receipts and payments, while deferrals relate to current cash receipts and payments.
