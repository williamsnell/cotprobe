Okay, I have this complex number expression to evaluate, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of complex numbers and their properties. Let me take it step by step.

The expression given is [(1 + cos(2x) + i*sin(2x)) / (1 + cos(2x) - i*sin(2x))]^30, and x is π/60. So I need to compute this and see which option it matches.

First, I remember that when dealing with complex numbers in the form a + ib and a - ib, especially in fractions, it's often helpful to express them in polar form. Polar form uses magnitude and angle, which can make exponentiation easier using De Moivre's theorem.

Let me denote the numerator as A = 1 + cos(2x) + i*sin(2x) and the denominator as B = 1 + cos(2x) - i*sin(2x). So the expression becomes (A/B)^30.

Hmm, perhaps I can write A and B in terms of exponential form. I recall Euler's formula: e^(iθ) = cosθ + i sinθ. But wait, in A and B, the coefficients of cos and sin are both 1, but the denominator has 1 + cos(2x) which is a real part.

Wait, maybe I can factor the 1 + cos(2x) out. Let me try that. Let's write A as (1 + cos(2x)) + i sin(2x). Similarly, B is (1 + cos(2x)) - i sin(2x).

So A = (1 + cos(2x)) + i sin(2x) = (1 + cos(2x)) * [1 + (i sin(2x))/(1 + cos(2x))]

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me consider that 1 + cos(2x) can be rewritten using a trigonometric identity. I remember that 1 + cos(2x) = 2 cos²x, and sin(2x) = 2 sinx cosx. Let me substitute these.

So, A becomes 2 cos²x + i*(2 sinx cosx) = 2 cosx (cosx + i sinx).

Similarly, B becomes 2 cos²x - i*(2 sinx cosx) = 2 cosx (cosx - i sinx).

So, A = 2 cosx (cosx + i sinx) and B = 2 cosx (cosx - i sinx).

Now, the ratio A/B would be [2 cosx (cosx + i sinx)] / [2 cosx (cosx - i sinx)].

The 2 cosx terms cancel out, so A/B = (cosx + i sinx) / (cosx - i sinx).

Hmm, that's better. Now, I can write this as [ (cosx + i sinx) ] / [ (cosx - i sinx) ].

I remember that the reciprocal of (cosx - i sinx) is (cosx + i sinx), because when you multiply them, you get cos²x + sin²x = 1. So, (cosx - i sinx)^-1 = cosx + i sinx.

Wait, so then A/B = (cosx + i sinx) * (cosx - i sinx)^-1. But since (cosx - i sinx) is the conjugate of (cosx + i sinx), their product is 1. So, A/B simplifies to (cosx + i sinx)^2, because (cosx + i sinx)/(cosx - i sinx) = (cosx + i sinx)^2.

Wait, let me check that again. Let me compute (cosx + i sinx)/(cosx - i sinx). Let me multiply numerator and denominator by (cosx + i sinx):

So, [(cosx + i sinx)(cosx + i sinx)] / [(cosx - i sinx)(cosx + i sinx)].

The denominator becomes cos²x + sin²x = 1, so it's just 1. The numerator is (cosx + i sinx)^2, which is cos²x + 2i cosx sinx - sin²x. Wait, but maybe it's better to write it as (cosx + i sinx)^2, which is e^(i2x) using Euler's formula.

Wait, because (cosx + i sinx) is e^(ix), so squared is e^(i2x). So, A/B is e^(i2x).

Wait, but earlier I thought A/B was equal to (cosx + i sinx)^2. Which would be e^(i2x). So, then the entire expression is [e^(i2x)]^30 = e^(i60x).

Since x is π/60, 60x = 60*(π/60) = π. So e^(iπ) is equal to cosπ + i sinπ = -1 + 0i = -1.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't skip any steps too quickly.

Let me re-express A/B again.

A = 1 + cos(2x) + i sin(2x) = 2 cos²x + i (2 sinx cosx) = 2 cosx (cosx + i sinx).

B = 1 + cos(2x) - i sin(2x) = 2 cos²x - i (2 sinx cosx) = 2 cosx (cosx - i sinx).

So A/B = [2 cosx (cosx + i sinx)] / [2 cosx (cosx - i sinx)].

The 2 cosx terms cancel, so A/B = (cosx + i sinx)/(cosx - i sinx).

Now, to compute this, I can multiply numerator and denominator by (cosx + i sinx) to rationalize the denominator.

So, numerator becomes (cosx + i sinx)^2, and denominator becomes (cosx)^2 + (sinx)^2 = 1.

So, A/B = (cosx + i sinx)^2 = cos(2x) + i sin(2x).

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Wait, so A/B is (cosx + i sinx)^2, which is cos(2x) + i sin(2x) = e^(i2x).

Wait, but earlier I thought it was e^(i2x), which is correct because (e^(ix))^2 = e^(i2x), yes.

So, the expression is [e^(i2x)]^30 = e^(i60x).

Now, x is π/60, so 60x is π. So e^(iπ) is cosπ + i sinπ = -1 + 0i = -1.

So, the value of the expression is -1, which is option E.

Wait, let me check again because sometimes I might have miscalculated.

Wait, let me compute A/B again. Alternatively, perhaps there's a more straightforward way.

Another approach: Let me compute the modulus and argument of A and B.

The modulus of A is sqrt( (1 + cos2x)^2 + (sin2x)^2 ).

Let me compute that: (1 + cos2x)^2 + sin²2x = 1 + 2 cos2x + cos²2x + sin²2x = 1 + 2 cos2x + (cos²2x + sin²2x) = 1 + 2 cos2x + 1 = 2 + 2 cos2x = 2(1 + cos2x).

Similarly, the modulus of B is the same because it's sqrt( (1 + cos2x)^2 + (-sin2x)^2 ), which is the same as A's modulus.

So, |A| = |B|, so when I take A/B, the modulus is 1, meaning it's a complex number on the unit circle, so it's just e^(iθ) for some angle θ.

The argument of A is the angle of (1 + cos2x) + i sin2x. Let me compute it.

The argument θ_A = arctan( (sin2x)/(1 + cos2x) ). Similarly, for B, the argument θ_B = arctan( (-sin2x)/(1 + cos2x) ) = -θ_A.

So, when I take A/B, the arguments subtract, so θ_A - (-θ_A) = 2θ_A.

So, the argument of A/B is 2θ_A.

Now, θ_A = arctan( (sin2x)/(1 + cos2x) ). I remember that there's a trigonometric identity here. Let me recall that tan(θ) = (sin2x)/(1 + cos2x) = tanx.

Because, using the identity tan(x/2) = (sinx)/(1 + cosx), but wait, perhaps another approach.

Wait, let me compute (sin2x)/(1 + cos2x). Using double-angle identities, sin2x = 2 sinx cosx, and 1 + cos2x = 2 cos²x. So, (sin2x)/(1 + cos2x) = (2 sinx cosx)/(2 cos²x) )= (sinx)/cosx = tanx.

So, θ_A = arctan(tanx) = x, since x is between 0 and π/2, so arctan(tanx) = x.

So, the argument of A/B is 2θ_A = 2x.

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, A/B has argument 2x, so A/B = e^(i2x).

Therefore, (A/B)^30 = e^(i60x).

Since x is π/60, 60x = π, so e^(iπ) = -1.

So, the result is -1, which is option E.

Wait, but earlier I thought the argument was 2x, leading to 60x = π, so the answer is -1. That's consistent.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier when I thought A/B was e^(i2x), but I think the steps are correct.

Wait, let me confirm: If A is (1 + cos2x) + i sin2x, then in polar form, its modulus is sqrt( (1 + cos2x)^2 + (sin2x)^2 ) = sqrt(1 + 2 cos2x + cos²2x + sin²2x) = sqrt(2 + 2 cos2x) = sqrt(4 cos²x) = 2 |cosx|, which for x between 0 and π/2 is 2 cosx.

The argument is arctan( (sin2x)/(1 + cos2x) ) = x, as established earlier.

So, A is 2 cosx * e^(i x). Similarly, B is 2 cosx * e^(-i x).

So, A/B = (2 cosx e^(i x)) / (2 cosx e^(-i x)) ) = e^(i2x).

Yes, that's correct. So, (A/B) is e^(i2x), and raising that to 30 gives e^(i60x).

With x = π/60, 60x = π, so e^(iπ) = -1.

Therefore, the answer is E: -1.0.
