Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about globalization and its purportedly beneficial outcomes. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking which option is NOT a beneficial outcome of globalization. The options are A through D. Let me read each one carefully.

Option A: Redistribution of wealth addressing disparities through interconnectedness. Hmm, I remember that globalization can lead to wealth redistribution, but does it necessarily address disparities? I think it might actually increase disparities because wealth tends to flow to developed countries more than to developing ones. So maybe A isn't a beneficial outcome but rather a negative. But I'm not sure yet.

Option B: Growing sense of global community and super-national identities. Globalization does bring people closer, like how the internet connects everyone. So people might feel more part of a global community. That seems positive, so B is likely a beneficial outcome.

Option C: Sharing of ideas, tech, resources benefiting human security, like medical advancements. Definitely, globalization has led to sharing of medical knowledge and technologies, which has improved healthcare globally. So C is a positive outcome.

Option D: Global market reducing poverty and making economic gains. I've heard that globalization has lifted many out of poverty, especially in countries like China and India. So D seems positive too.

Wait, going back to A. The redistribution of wealth to address disparities. I think globalization can lead to more wealth concentration in developed countries, making disparities worse rather than better. So A might not be a real benefit but a downside. Or is it? Maybe some argue that over time, wealth redistribution could help, but I'm not sure if that's a commonly accepted benefit.

So the question is which is NOT a benefit. So if A is not a benefit, then the answer is A. Alternatively, if A is a stated benefit, then the answer is another option.

Wait, the question says "purportedly beneficial," meaning which one is claimed as a benefit but actually isn't. Or which one is not a benefit at all.

Alternatively, maybe A is a real benefit because some argue that global trade can help redistribute wealth more evenly, but in reality, it might not. But the question is about what is NOT a purportedly beneficial outcome, meaning which one is not considered a benefit, even if it's not actually true.

So, looking at the options again. A says it's about addressing disparities through interconnectedness. But I think that the redistribution might not address disparities effectively; in fact, it might worsen them. So A is not a benefit, making it the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Globalization is often cited for things like spreading technology, economic growth, and global markets, which are options B, C, and D. So A is the one that's not a commonly accepted benefit because, while it's claimed, in reality, it doesn't address disparities well. Or maybe A is a benefit posited by some theories, but in practice, it doesn't hold. Either way, the question is asking which is NOT a purportedly beneficial outcome. So if all except one are considered beneficial, the odd one out is the answer.

I think A is the one that's not a real benefit, so the answer is A.

The question asks which option is not a purportedly beneficial outcome of globalization. 

- **Option A** suggests that globalization leads to the redistribution of wealth to address disparities. However, globalization is more likely to exacerbate wealth inequalities rather than reduce them, making this option not a recognized benefit.
- **Option B** highlights the growing sense of global community, which is a positive outcome of globalization.
- **Option C** refers to the sharing of ideas and technologies, such as medical advancements, which are clear benefits.
- **Option D** mentions the global market's ability to reduce poverty and drive economic gains, which is widely recognized as a positive effect.

Thus, **Option A** is not a purportedly beneficial outcome of globalization.

Answer: A
