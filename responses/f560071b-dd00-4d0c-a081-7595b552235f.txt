Okay, so I've got this fluid dynamics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question says. It's about an incompressible vortex flow in three dimensions. The axial velocity is given as w = 2az, and the circumferential velocity v_theta is (A/r)[1 - exp(-a r²)]. I need to find the radial velocity v_r.

Hmm, right. So, I remember that for incompressible flows, the divergence of the velocity field must be zero. That's the continuity equation. So, the velocity field has components v_r, v_theta, and w (which is v_z here). 

The continuity equation in cylindrical coordinates (r, theta, z) is given by:

(1/r) * ∂(r v_r)/∂r + (1/r) * ∂v_theta/∂theta + ∂w/∂z = 0

Since the flow is axisymmetric, I think that means the velocity components don't depend on theta. So, the partial derivative of v_theta with respect to theta would be zero. Similarly, if the flow is steady, maybe the partial derivative of w with respect to z is zero? Or wait, the problem doesn't specify if it's steady. Hmm, but the velocity components given don't depend on time, so I'll assume it's steady. So ∂w/∂z would be zero as well.

Wait, let me check the given velocity components. Axial velocity w is 2az, which depends on z. So the ∂w/∂z would be 2a, which is a constant. Wait, that's a problem because if I plug that into the continuity equation, it might not be zero. Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me write down the continuity equation more carefully.

Continuity equation:

(1/r) * ∂(r v_r)/∂r + (1/r) * ∂v_theta/∂theta + ∂w/∂z = 0

Given that the flow is axisymmetric, ∂v_theta/∂theta = 0. So that term drops out. Now, if the flow is also steady, then ∂w/∂z would be zero. But in this case, w = 2 a z, so ∂w/∂z = 2a, which is not zero. Hmm, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe the flow isn't necessarily steady? Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, but the problem says it's incompressible, so the continuity equation must hold regardless of whether it's steady or not. So let me proceed with the given information.

So, substituting what we have:

(1/r) * ∂(r v_r)/∂r + (1/r) * 0 + 2a = 0

Wait, that can't be right because 2a is a constant and adding it to the other term would set the sum to zero. So,

(1/r) * ∂(r v_r)/∂r = -2a

Wait, but that equation would then imply that ∂(r v_r)/∂r = -2 a r. Integrating that with respect to r would give r v_r = -a r² + C, where C is the constant of integration. So,

v_r = (-a r² + C) / r = -a r + C/r

But wait, that's a radial velocity that depends on r. But looking at the options, I don't see an option that looks like that. All the options are linear in r or 1/r, except maybe some with negative signs. So perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that ∂w/∂z is 2a. Let me double-check the given w.

Wait, the given w is 2 a z. So ∂w/∂z is indeed 2a. That term can't be zero. So, according to the continuity equation, (1/r) * ∂(r v_r)/∂r + 2a = 0. So,

∂(r v_r)/∂r = -2a r

Integrate both sides with respect to r:

r v_r = ∫-2a r dr = -a r² + C

So,

v_r = (-a r² + C)/r = -a r + C/r

But this seems problematic because I'm getting a non-zero v_r, but looking at the options, the only possible options are E: v_r=0, but that would only be possible if the other terms somehow cancel out. Alternatively, perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the flow is such that ∂w/∂z isn't contributing to the continuity equation. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the given velocities. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I mixed up the components. In cylindrical coordinates, the velocity components are v_r, v_theta, and v_z. Here, the problem uses w to denote the axial component, which I think is v_z. So, w = v_z = 2 a z.

So the continuity equation becomes:

(1/r) ∂(r v_r)/∂r + (1/r) ∂v_theta/∂theta + ∂v_z/∂z = 0

But since the flow is axisymmetric, ∂v_theta/∂theta = 0. So,

(1/r) ∂(r v_r)/∂r + ∂v_z/∂z = 0

Now, v_z is given as 2 a z, so ∂v_z/∂z = 2 a.

So,

(1/r) ∂(r v_r)/∂r + 2 a = 0

Which leads to:

∂(r v_r)/∂r = -2 a r

Integrate with respect to r:

r v_r = -a r² + C

So,

v_r = -a r + C/r

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them have a term with C/r. So perhaps the integration constant C is zero? That would give v_r = -a r, but that's option I: v_r = a r, but negative. Wait, option I is v_r = a r, and option J is v_r = -a/r². So, -a r is not an option. Wait, looking back at the options, option I is v_r = a r, which would be positive, but our result is negative a r, which isn't an option. The closest is option I, but it's positive. So maybe I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the flow is incompressible regardless of the continuity equation. Wait, no, incompressibility requires that the divergence is zero. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the given velocities are such that the radial velocity is zero. Let me think differently. Maybe the circumferential velocity v_theta is given, and we can compute the other terms.

Let me write out the divergence equation again. Since the flow is axisymmetric, the only non-zero derivatives are with respect to r. So,

(1/r) ∂(r v_r)/∂r + ∂v_z/∂z = 0

But v_z is 2 a z, so ∂v_z/∂z = 2 a. So,

(1/r) ∂(r v_r)/∂r = -2 a

Which again gives us ∂(r v_r)/∂r = -2 a r

Integrating, r v_r = -a r² + C → v_r = -a r + C/r

But looking at the options, none of the options match this unless C is zero, which would give v_r = -a r. But that's not one of the options. Wait, option I is v_r = a r, which is positive, but we have negative. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, let me check the signs again. The continuity equation says that the sum of the terms is zero. So,

(1/r) ∂(r v_r)/∂r = - ∂v_z/∂z = -2 a

So,

∂(r v_r)/∂r = -2 a r

Which when integrated gives r v_r = -a r² + C, so v_r = -a r + C/r.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the given v_theta is (A/r)[1 - exp(-a r²)]. So maybe I can compute the other terms. Let me see if I can find any other constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps the radial velocity is zero. Let me think: if v_r is zero, then we can check if that satisfies the continuity equation.

If v_r = 0, then ∂(r v_r)/∂r = 0. Then,

(1/r)*0 + 2 a = 0 → 2a = 0 → a=0. But a is a given constant, so that can't be right. So v_r can't be zero unless a is zero, which isn't the case. So v_r is not zero.

Hmm, but that's conflicting because none of the options match the expression I derived. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the flow is irrotational or something else. No, wait, it's a vortex flow, which usually has non-zero vorticity. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the vorticity and see if that helps, but that might complicate things.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about the velocity components in cylindrical coordinates. The velocity is given as:

v_r = ?

v_theta = (A/r)[1 - exp(-a r²)]

w = 2 a z → v_z = 2 a z

The continuity equation is:

(1/r) ∂(r v_r)/∂r + (1/r) ∂v_theta/∂theta + ∂v_z/∂z = 0

But as before, since it's axisymmetric, ∂v_theta/∂theta = 0. And ∂v_z/∂z = 2a.

So,

(1/r) ∂(r v_r)/∂r + 2a = 0 → ∂(r v_r)/∂r = -2 a r

Integrate: r v_r = - a r² + C → v_r = -a r + C/r

But none of the options have this form. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the given v_theta is such that when I compute its derivative, I can find another relation. Let me compute ∂v_theta/∂r.

v_theta = (A/r) [1 - exp(-a r²)] → ∂v_theta/∂r = A [ -1/r² (1 - exp(-a r²)) + (2 a r) exp(-a r²)/r ]

Wait, no, let me compute it step by step.

v_theta = (A/r) [1 - exp(-a r²)] = A [ (1 - exp(-a r²)) / r ]

So,

∂v_theta/∂r = A [ d/dr (1 - exp(-a r²))/r ]

Using the quotient rule:

= A [ (d/dr (1 - exp(-a r²))) * r - (1 - exp(-a r²)) * d/dr (r) ) ] / r²

Compute d/dr (1 - exp(-a r²)) = 0 - exp(-a r²) * (-2 a r) ) = 2 a r exp(-a r²)

So,

= A [ (2 a r exp(-a r²) * r) - (1 - exp(-a r²)) * 1 ) ] / r²

Simplify numerator:

= A [ 2 a r² exp(-a r²) - (1 - exp(-a r²)) ] 

So,

∂v_theta/∂r = A [ 2 a r² exp(-a r²) -1 + exp(-a r²) ] / r²

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe not directly. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the radial velocity is zero. But earlier that didn't work because it leads to 2a=0.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the flow is such that the radial velocity is zero. Let me try that. If v_r = 0, then the continuity equation becomes:

(1/r) * 0 + 2a = 0 → 2a = 0 → a=0, which is impossible. So v_r can't be zero.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the given w is not v_z but another component. Or maybe the problem uses a different notation for the axial component. Alternatively, perhaps I should check the units or the dimensions, but that might not help directly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the given w is a function of z, and in the continuity equation, we have to account for that. But I think I did that correctly.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the given velocity field is not incompressible unless v_r is non-zero. But the problem states it's incompressible, so v_r must be non-zero to satisfy the equation.

Wait, but the options don't include v_r = -a r + C/r. So perhaps I made a mistake in the integration. Let me check the integration again.

From ∂(r v_r)/∂r = -2 a r, integrating both sides with respect to r:

r v_r = ∫ -2 a r dr = -a r² + C → v_r = (-a r² + C ) / r = -a r + C/r

Yes, that's correct. So unless C is zero, which would make v_r = -a r, but that's not an option. Wait, looking at the options, option I is v_r = a r, which is positive. So perhaps there's a sign error.

Wait, perhaps the given w is not 2 a z but 2 a z, and the sign in the continuity equation is correct. Let me re-express the equation:

(1/r) ∂(r v_r)/∂r + ∂w/∂z = 0 → ∂(r v_r)/∂r = - r ∂w/∂z

Wait, no, the equation is:

(1/r) ∂(r v_r)/∂r + ∂w/∂z = 0 → ∂(r v_r)/∂r = - r ∂w/∂z

Wait, no, that's not correct. The equation is:

(1/r) ∂(r v_r)/∂r = - ∂w/∂z → ∂(r v_r)/∂r = - r ∂w/∂z

So,

∂(r v_r)/∂r = - r (2a) = -2 a r

Which is what I had before. So integrating gives v_r = -a r + C/r.

Hmm, but again, none of the options match. So perhaps the problem is designed so that C is zero, making v_r = -a r, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me check again.

Wait, the problem says the axial velocity is w = 2 a z. So ∂w/∂z = 2a. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the given v_theta is such that when I compute the other terms, it contributes to the continuity equation. But earlier I thought that the continuity equation only includes v_r and w because v_theta is axisymmetric, so its derivative with respect to theta is zero. So perhaps I should include it again.

Wait, no, because v_theta is given as a function of r only, so ∂v_theta/∂theta is zero. So that term is zero.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering an inviscid flow, but that doesn't change the continuity equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the vorticity and apply some other condition, but that might complicate things further.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the given v_theta is such that its derivative with respect to r contributes to the vorticity, but that's beyond the continuity equation.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again. The options are:

A: v_r = - ar

B: v_r = - 2ar

C: v_r = ar^2

D: v_r = a/r

E: v_r = 0

F: v_r = 2a/r

G: v_r = 2ar

H: v_r = -2a/r^2

I: v_r = ar

J: v_r = -a/r^2

From my earlier calculation, v_r = -a r + C/r. If C is zero, then v_r = -a r, which is option A. But option A is v_r = -a r. Wait, yes, option A is -a r. So perhaps that's the correct answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought that if v_r = -a r, then the continuity equation would require (1/r) * ∂(r*(-a r))/∂r + 2a = 0.

Let me compute that:

r v_r = r*(-a r) = -a r²

∂(r v_r)/∂r = -2 a r

So,

(1/r)*(-2 a r) + 2a = (-2 a) + 2a = 0 → 0=0.

Yes, that works. So v_r = -a r satisfies the continuity equation. So the correct answer is option A: v_r = -a r.

Wait, but earlier I thought that none of the options matched, but I must have missed that option A is exactly -a r. So the answer should be option A.

To determine the radial velocity \( v_r \) for the given incompressible vortex flow, we use the continuity equation in cylindrical coordinates:

\[
\frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial (r v_r)}{\partial r} + \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial v_\theta}{\partial \theta} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial z} = 0
\]

Since the flow is axisymmetric, \( \frac{\partial v_\theta}{\partial \theta} = 0 \). Additionally, the axial velocity \( w = 2az \), so \( \frac{\partial w}{\partial z} = 2a \). Substituting these into the continuity equation gives:

\[
\frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial (r v_r)}{\partial r} + 2a = 0
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\frac{\partial (r v_r)}{\partial r} = -2a r
\]

Integrating with respect to \( r \):

\[
r v_r = -a r^2 + C \quad \Rightarrow \quad v_r = -a r + \frac{C}{r}
\]

To match the given options, we assume \( C = 0 \), which simplifies \( v_r \) to:

\[
v_r = -a r
\]

This matches option **A**. Verifying, if \( v_r = -a r \), the continuity equation is satisfied:

\[
\frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial (r (-a r))}{\partial r} + 2a = -2a + 2a = 0
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**A: \( v_r = -a r \)**
