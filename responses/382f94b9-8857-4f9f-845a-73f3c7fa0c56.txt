Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about infinity and what Craig says about it. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is: "Craig says an actually infinite number of things _____." And I have to choose the correct option from A to J. 

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It seems like it's about the concept of actual infinity, which is a term used in mathematics and philosophy. From what I remember, actual infinity refers to the idea that there can be infinitely many things, not just a potential infinity that can be extended indefinitely. 

Craig is probably referring to the philosopher William Lane Craig, who has discussed the concept of actual infinity in his work, especially in debates about theism and the nature of the universe. I recall that Craig argues against the actual infinity of the universe, suggesting that only potential infinity is possible. He might say that an actually infinite number of things cannot exist in reality because it leads to paradoxes or logical inconsistencies.

Looking at the options:

A: cannot exist
B: can be physically observed
C: can be counted one by one
D: is a concept beyond human comprehension
E: only exists in mathematics
F: can only exist in theory
G: is meaningless
H: exists somewhere
I: is possible
J: is a paradox

So, I'm trying to remember what Craig's position is. I think he argues that actual infinity is a mathematical concept but not something that can exist in the physical world. He might say that an actually infinite number of things cannot exist because it leads to problems like the paradox of the infinite hotel or other logical issues.

Option A says "cannot exist." That seems to align with Craig's argument because he might say that actual infinity is not possible in reality, only in theory or math. 

Option B says they can be physically observed. I don't think Craig would agree with that; he probably thinks actual infinity isn't something we can observe physically.

Option C is about counting one by one. But infinity can't be counted in that way since it's unbounded. However, I'm not sure if that's what Craig says.

Option D suggests it's beyond human comprehension. That's a possible angle, but I think Craig's main issue is more about the logical possibility rather than comprehension.

Option E says it only exists in math. That might be true, but I think the question is more about whether it can exist at all, not just its domain.

Option F says it can only exist in theory. That's similar to E but phrased differently. If Craig says it's not possible, then F could be correct, but I'm not sure if that's the exact wording he uses.

Option G says it's meaningless. That might be a bit too strong, as infinity is a meaningful concept in math.

Option H says it exists somewhere. That's vague, but I'm not sure how it applies here.

Option I says it's possible. If Craig is against it, then I would be incorrect.

Option J says it's a paradox. I think paradoxes are more about the problems that arise from assuming actual infinity, but Craig's argument is more about the impossibility of it existing.

So, putting it together, I think the best answer is A: cannot exist. Because Craig's argument is that actual infinity leads to logical contradictions, so he would say it cannot exist.

The question revolves around William Lane Craig's stance on actual infinity. Craig argues that actual infinity cannot exist in reality because it leads to logical paradoxes and inconsistencies. Therefore, the correct answer is that an actually infinite number of things cannot exist.

Answer: A
