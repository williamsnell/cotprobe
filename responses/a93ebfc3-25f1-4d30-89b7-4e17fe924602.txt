Okay, so I have this series to evaluate: S equals the sum from n equals 0 to infinity of 1 over 3 to the n. Hmm, I remember that series can be finite or infinite, and this one goes to infinity, so it's an infinite series. I think this is a geometric series because each term is a constant ratio times the previous one. 

Wait, yeah, a geometric series has the form a + ar + ar² + ar³ + ..., where 'a' is the first term and 'r' is the common ratio. In this case, the first term when n=0 is 1/(3^0) which is 1. Then the next term is 1/(3^1) which is 1/3, then 1/(3^2)=1/9, and so on. So the common ratio r is 1/3 because each term is multiplied by 1/3 to get the next term. 

I remember that the sum of an infinite geometric series can be found using the formula S = a / (1 - r), but only if the absolute value of r is less than 1. In this case, r is 1/3, which is definitely less than 1, so the formula should work. 

Plugging in the values: a is 1, r is 1/3. So the sum S would be 1 divided by (1 minus 1/3). Let me calculate that. 1 minus 1/3 is 2/3. So 1 divided by (2/3) is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal, which is 3/2. Wait, no, 1 divided by (2/3) is 3/2? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 1/(2/3) is 3/2? No, wait, 1 divided by (2/3) is 3/2? Hmm, let me check: 2/3 times 3/2 is 1, so yes, that's correct. 

Wait, but 3/2 is 1.5, which is option J. Let me look at the options again. Option J is 3/2, so that would be the answer. 

Wait, but did I make a mistake? Let me go through it again. The first term a is 1 (n=0), ratio r is 1/3. Sum S = a/(1 - r) = 1/(1 - 1/3) = 1/(2/3) = 3/2. Yeah, that seems right. 

I think I'm confident with that. So the answer should be J: 3/2.

The series is a geometric series with first term 1 and common ratio 1/3. Using the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series, S = a / (1 - r) = 1 / (1 - 1/3) = 3/2.

Answer: J
