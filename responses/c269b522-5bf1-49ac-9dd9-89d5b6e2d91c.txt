Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mr. Williams and his property taxes. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. 

The question says Mr. Williams owns a piece of property assessed at $7,800 in a city with a tax rate of $2.80 per $100. The options are A to J, each with different amounts. I need to figure out how much he pays in property taxes.

Hmm, so I think this is a simple calculation. The tax rate is given per $100 of assessed value, so I probably need to multiply the assessed value by the tax rate per $100. But wait, sometimes when calculating taxes, you might have to consider whether it's a flat rate or something else, but in this case, it's straightforward.

Let me break it down. The assessed value is $7,800. The tax rate is $2.80 per $100. So for every $100, you pay $2.80. So I can find out how many $100 units are in $7,800 and then multiply by $2.80.

Calculating the number of $100 units: 7,800 divided by 100 is 78. So there are 78 units of $100 each.

Now, multiply that by the tax per unit: 78 * 2.80. Let me compute that.

78 times 2 is 156, and 78 times 0.80 is 62.40. So adding those together: 156 + 62.40 = 218.40. 

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is $218.40. So that seems to match. But let me double-check because sometimes decimal points can cause issues.

Alternatively, I can think of it as $2.80 per $100, so per $100, 2.80. So for $7,800, which is 78 * 100, the total tax is 78 * 2.80, which again is 218.40, same as before.

Wait, but am I missing something? The options have other numbers too. Let me check all the options again. 

Options are:
A: 218.40
B: 220.00
C: 234.00
D: 210.00
E: 225.60
F: 200.00
G: 246.40
H: 232.20
I: 198.00
J: 204.00

So A is 218.40, which matches my calculation. But wait, I thought I might have made a mistake because another option is there. Did I calculate correctly?

Wait another way: perhaps I should consider whether the tax is applied per $1, not per $100. No, the problem says $2.80 per $100. So, for each $100, pay $2.80.

Alternatively, perhaps it's 2.80 per $100, so $2.80 per 100, so for $7,800, it's 78 * 2.80 = 218.40.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. 78 multiplied by 2.80. Let's compute 78 * 2 = 156, and 78*0.80=62.4. 156+62.4=218.4. So that's correct.

Looking at the options, option A is $218.40, which seems to be the answer. But wait, I'm a bit confused because option B is $220.00, which is a bit higher. Did I miscalculate?

Wait, maybe I should check the numbers again. 78 times 2.80:

2.80 * 70 is 196.00, and 2.80 *8 is 22.40. Adding those gives 196 + 22.40 = 218.40. So yes, that's correct.

So the correct answer should be option A: $218.40.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 218.40, which is what I got. So that's the right answer.
</think>

The correct answer is A: $218.40.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understand the Problem:** The assessed value of the property is $7,800, and the tax rate is $2.80 per $100.

2. **Calculate the Number of $100 Units:** 
   - Divide the assessed value by 100: 7,800 รท 100 = 78 units.

3. **Compute the Total Tax:**
   - Multiply the number of units by the tax rate: 78 * $2.80 = $218.40.

4. **Match with Options:** Option A is $218.40, which matches the calculated amount.
