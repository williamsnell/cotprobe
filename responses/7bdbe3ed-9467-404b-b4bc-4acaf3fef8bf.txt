Alright, so I have this question about comparative advantage and whether it only applies to international trade. I remember from my economics class that comparative advantage is a key concept in trade theory. Let me think through this.

First, what is comparative advantage? I think it's the idea that countries should specialize in producing goods where they have the lowest opportunity cost. This way, they can maximize the efficiency of production and benefit from trade. But wait, does this principle only apply to international trade, or can it be used in other contexts too?

I recall that the concept of comparative advantage isn't limited to countries. It's more about how different entities, whether they're countries, companies, or even individuals, can benefit from specializing in certain activities based on their relative efficiencies. So, if two countries each have an absolute advantage in producing two goods, but one is more efficient in one good and the other in the other, they can both benefit by trading. But can this idea be applied elsewhere?

Looking at the options, option D says, "No, it applies wherever productive units have different relative efficiencies." That sounds right because it's not just about countries trading; it's about any situation where different entities have different efficiencies. For example, a company might have departments that are more efficient in certain tasks, so they should specialize in those areas.

Option E says it only applies to international trade, which seems too restrictive. I don't think that's correct because the principle is more general. Similarly, option C talks about neighboring countries, which is a specific case, not the broader application.

Option A says it applies only to consumer choice in the market. That doesn't seem right because comparative advantage is more about production and trade between entities, not just consumers choosing products.

Option B suggests it's only for services, but I know that comparative advantage applies to both goods and services, so that's incorrect.

Option F says it applies only to domestic trade, which is the opposite of international. So that's not right.

Option G is about financial transactions, which I don't think is the main domain of comparative advantage. It's more about production and exchange of goods and services.

Option H is about barter across borders, which is too narrow and not the general application.

Option I talks about division of labor within a company. While related, comparative advantage is broader and applies to trade situations, not just internal division.

Option J is about trade between countries on the same continent, which again is too specific.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be D because it correctly states that comparative advantage applies wherever there are differences in relative efficiencies, not just in international trade.

The principle of comparative advantage is not limited to international trade but applies more broadly to situations where entities have differing efficiencies in producing goods or services. It encourages specialization based on relative strengths, leading to mutual benefits through trade. This concept is applicable in various contexts, including businesses and economic exchanges beyond just countries.
