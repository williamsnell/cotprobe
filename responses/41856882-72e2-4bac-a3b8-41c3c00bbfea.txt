Okay, so I'm trying to solve this determinant problem. Let's see what the question is. It says that A and B are both orthogonal square matrices, and the determinant of A is equal to the negative determinant of B. I need to find the determinant of A plus B, and choose the correct numerical value from the options given.

First, I need to recall what orthogonal matrices are. Orthogonal matrices have the property that their transpose is equal to their inverse. So, that means A^T = A^{-1} and similarly for B. Another important property of orthogonal matrices is that their determinants have absolute value 1. So, det(A) = ±1 and det(B) = ±1.

The problem states that det(A) = -det(B). Let's denote det(A) as d. Then det(B) would be -d. But since the determinants of orthogonal matrices are either 1 or -1, this means that d must be 1 and det(B) is -1, or d is -1 and det(B) is 1. Either way, the determinants are negatives of each other.

Now, the question is asking for det(A + B). Hmm, determinants don't work like regular addition. Just because you add two matrices, the determinant of the sum isn't simply the sum of the determinants. So, det(A + B) isn't equal to det(A) + det(B). That's a common mistake, but I remember that determinants don't distribute over addition.

I think I need to find a way to relate A and B that could help me compute det(A + B). Maybe there's a property or theorem that could be useful here. Let me think about the properties of orthogonal matrices. Since A and B are orthogonal, their inverses are their transposes. So, A^{-1} = A^T and B^{-1} = B^T.

Wait, but I'm not sure how that helps directly. Maybe I should consider specific examples of orthogonal matrices and see if I can find a pattern. Let's take small matrices, like 2x2 or 3x3, and see what happens.

Let me start with 2x2 matrices because they're simpler. So, suppose A and B are both 2x2 orthogonal matrices. Let's pick A as a rotation matrix. A common rotation matrix is:

A = [cosθ  -sinθ]
    [sinθ   cosθ]

The determinant of A is cos²θ + sin²θ = 1, so det(A) = 1.

Now, let's pick B such that det(B) = -1. An orthogonal matrix with determinant -1 could be a reflection matrix. For example, a reflection over the x-axis:

B = [1  0]
    [0 -1]

The determinant of B is (1)(-1) - (0)(0) = -1, so det(B) = -1. That satisfies the condition det(A) = -det(B) because det(A) is 1 and det(B) is -1.

Now, let's compute A + B. Adding these two matrices:

A + B = [cosθ + 1,  -sinθ + 0]
        [sinθ + 0,  cosθ + (-1)]

Wait, no. Wait, B is the matrix I wrote, so when adding, it's element-wise. So:

First element (1,1): cosθ + 1
Second element (1,2): -sinθ + 0 = -sinθ
Third element (2,1): sinθ + 0 = sinθ
Fourth element (2,2): cosθ + (-1) = cosθ -1

So, A + B is:

[cosθ + 1    -sinθ
 sinθ       cosθ -1]

Now, let's compute the determinant of this matrix. The determinant of a 2x2 matrix [a b; c d] is ad - bc.

So, det(A+B) = (cosθ +1)(cosθ -1) - (-sinθ)(sinθ).

Let me compute each part:

First term: (cosθ +1)(cosθ -1) = cos²θ -1
Second term: (-sinθ)(sinθ) = -sin²θ, but since it's subtracted, it becomes + sin²θ.

So, det(A+B) = (cos²θ -1) + sin²θ.

Simplify this: cos²θ + sin²θ is 1, so 1 -1 =0. Therefore, det(A+B)=0.

Wait, that's interesting. So for 2x2 matrices, the determinant of A+B is zero. But does this hold for larger matrices as well?

Let me test with 3x3 matrices. Maybe take A as the identity matrix, which is orthogonal with determinant 1. Then B would have determinant -1. Let's choose B such that it's orthogonal and has determinant -1. For example, B could be the identity matrix multiplied by -1 on the diagonal in such a way that the determinant is -1. Wait, actually, the determinant of the identity matrix is 1. To get determinant -1, perhaps B is a reflection matrix, like a permutation matrix that swaps two axes and has a determinant of -1.

For 3x3, a simple example is a matrix that has -1 in one of the diagonal positions and 1s elsewhere on the diagonal. Wait, no, because the determinant would be the product of the diagonal elements. So if the diagonal is [1,1,-1], the determinant is -1. But that's a diagonal matrix. Let me construct B as a diagonal matrix with entries 1,1,-1. So B would be:

B = [1 0 0
     0 1 0
     0 0 -1]

This is orthogonal because it's diagonal with entries ±1.

Now, A is the identity matrix:

A = [1 0 0
     0 1 0
     0 0 1]

Then A + B would be:

[1+1, 0+0, 0+0
 0+0, 1+1, 0+0
 0+0, 0+0, 1+(-1)]

Which simplifies to:

[2 0 0
 0 2 0
 0 0 0]

The determinant of this matrix is the product of the diagonal elements: 2*2*0 = 0.

So again, det(A + B) is 0.

Hmm, so in both 2x2 and 3x3 cases, the determinant of A+B is zero. Does this hold in general for any orthogonal matrices A and B where det(A) = -det(B)?

I think so. Because when you add two orthogonal matrices with determinants that are negatives of each other, the resulting matrix A + B might have some properties that make its determinant zero.

Wait, but why does this happen? Let me think more deeply. For orthogonal matrices, A^T A = I and B^T B = I. But what about A + B? Is there a way to see that A + B is singular, meaning it has determinant zero?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a more general approach. Let's consider that A and B are orthogonal, so they represent reflections or rotations. If A is a rotation and B is a reflection, then adding them might result in a matrix that's not invertible.

Wait, another approach: suppose that A and B are orthogonal, so A^T = A^{-1} and B^T = B^{-1}.

If det(A) = -det(B), then det(A) = -det(B), so det(A) + det(B) = 0.

But does that help with det(A + B)? Not directly, because determinants don't add like that. So maybe that's a red herring.

Wait, but in the examples I tried, the determinant was zero. So perhaps in general, the determinant is zero. But why?

Let me think about the trace. Wait, the trace is the sum of the eigenvalues, but I'm not sure that's directly helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps A + B has a nontrivial kernel, meaning there's a non-zero vector v such that (A + B)v = 0. If that's the case, then A v = - B v. So, B v = -A v.

But since A and B are orthogonal, they preserve the inner product. So, taking the inner product of both sides with themselves:

v^T B^T B v = v^T A^T A v
v^T (B^T B) v = v^T (A^T A) v
v^T I v = v^T I v
Which simplifies to v^T v = v^T v, which is always true, so that doesn't give me any new information.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since in both 2x2 and 3x3 cases, the determinant was zero, perhaps it's always zero. Therefore, the answer should be 0.0, which is option B.

The problem involves two orthogonal square matrices, A and B, with det(A) = -det(B). Orthogonal matrices have determinants of ±1, so det(A) = 1 and det(B) = -1, or vice versa. The goal is to find det(A + B).

For 2x2 matrices, consider A as a rotation matrix and B as a reflection matrix. Adding these matrices results in a matrix whose determinant is computed to be zero. Similarly, for 3x3 matrices, choosing A as the identity matrix and B as a diagonal matrix with determinant -1, the sum A + B results in a matrix with a determinant of zero. These examples suggest that det(A + B) is consistently zero when A and B are orthogonal matrices with det(A) = -det(B). Thus, the answer is:

B: 0.0
