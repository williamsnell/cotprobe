Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the ecological approach to urban sociology. I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking what the ecological approach involved studying. The options are from A to J. Let me go through each one.

Option A: Impact of city infrastructure on the local ecosystem. Hmm, that sounds relevant because infrastructure like roads and buildings can affect the environment. But is that specifically the ecological approach?

Option B: How men and women used public spaces differently. That sounds more like gender studies within urban sociology, not necessarily ecological. So maybe not this one.

Option C: People organizing protests about environmental issues. That seems more like social movements or environmental sociology, not the ecological approach's focus.

Option D: Rate of pollution in different parts. Pollution is an environmental issue, but does it fall under the ecological approach in urban sociology? I'm not sure yet.

Option E: How urbanization affects the local climate. Climate change and urban heat islands are topics I've heard about. Maybe this is part of it, but I'm not certain if it's the main focus.

Option F: Forms of wildlife and natural habitats on city edges. That seems more about urban ecology, looking at where animals live near cities. I think the ecological approach might focus on this, but I'm not sure.

Option G: Relationship between city size and biodiversity. Biodiversity is definitely an ecological concern, but does this relate to urban sociology? Maybe, but I'm not sure if it's the primary focus.

Option H: Influence of architecture on animal populations. Architecture affects where animals can live, but again, I'm not sure if this is the main point of the ecological approach in sociology.

Option I: How social groups colonized areas and competed for resources. This sounds more like social geography or conflict theory, focusing on how different groups use space. Not sure if it's ecological.

Option J: Effects of city planning on water systems and green spaces. City planning definitely impacts the environment, and green spaces are part of urban ecology. This seems relevant.

Wait, what exactly is the ecological approach in urban sociology? From what I remember, it's about how the physical environment interacts with social structures. So it looks at the city as an ecosystem, considering both the natural elements and how humans use the space.

So, thinking again, option F talks about wildlife and habitats on the edges. That's more about the natural part, but maybe not the human interaction. Option J is about city planning affecting water and green spaces, which directly ties human planning to environmental aspects. That seems more aligned with studying the interaction between the built environment and ecological elements.

Option I is about social groups and resources, which is more about social dynamics, not the ecological aspects. Option E is about climate, which is a broader environmental issue but may not be the focus of urban ecological studies.

So, putting it together, the ecological approach likely studies how the physical environment and urban planning impact the city's ecological aspects. Therefore, option J seems to fit because it's about city planning's effects on water and green spaces, which are key ecological elements in urban settings.

The ecological approach to urban sociology focuses on the interaction between the physical environment and social structures within cities. It examines how urban planning and design impact the natural elements and ecological systems. Among the options, studying the effects of city planning on water systems and green spaces (Option J) best captures this focus, as it directly addresses how human activities shape and are shaped by the urban environment.

Answer: J
