Question:

Two single-user workstations are attached to the same local area network. On one of these workstations, file pages are accessed over the network from a file server; the average access time per page is 0.1 second. On the other of these workstations, file pages are accessed from a local disk; the average access time per page is 0.05 second. A particular compilation requires 30 seconds of computation and 200 file page accesses. What is the ratio of the total time required by this compilation if run on the diskless (file server) workstation to the total time required if run on the workstation with the local disk, if it is assumed that computation is not overlapped with file access?

Options:

A: 5/4
B: 10/5
C: 6/5
D: 5/3
E: 3/1
F: 4/3
G: 1/1
H: 7/4
I: 3/2
J: 2/1

Okay, so I've got this question here about two workstations on the same LAN. One is diskless and accesses files from a server, and the other has a local disk. The task is to find the ratio of the total time for a compilation job when run on each.

Let me break it down. The job needs 30 seconds of computation and 200 file page accesses. On the diskless workstation, each page takes 0.1 seconds. On the local disk, it's 0.05 seconds per page.

Wait, but the question says computation isn't overlapped with file access. So I guess the total time is the sum of computation time and file access time. Because without overlapping, they happen one after the other.

So for the diskless workstation: computation is 30s, and file accesses are 200 * 0.1s. Let me calculate that. 200 times 0.1 is 20 seconds. So total time is 30 + 20 = 50 seconds.

For the local disk: computation is still 30s, and file accesses are 200 * 0.05s. 200 * 0.05 is 10 seconds. So total time here is 30 + 10 = 40 seconds.

Now, the question asks for the ratio of the diskless time to the local disk time. That's 50/40, which simplifies to 5/4. So the ratio is 5/4.

Looking at the options, option A is 5/4. So the answer should be A.

The total time for the diskless workstation is 50 seconds, and for the local disk workstation, it's 40 seconds. The ratio is 50/40 = 5/4.

Answer: A
