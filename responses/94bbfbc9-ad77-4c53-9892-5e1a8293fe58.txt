Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about the percentage of people in India who think political parties are corrupt as of 2013. The options are A through J, with numbers ranging from 10% to 90%. 

First, I remember that India has had issues with corruption for a long time. There was a big anti-corruption movement a few years back, maybe around 2011 or so, led by people like Anna Hazare. That movement was in response to some major corruption scandals, like the 2G scam and the commonwealth games scandal. So, it makes sense that around that time, public perception of political parties being corrupt would be high.

I think I've heard some statistics before about this. I recall that a survey or poll in 2013 indicated a significant portion of the population felt that way. Let me try to remember the exact figure. I think it was over 50%, maybe like 70% or so. But I'm not sure if it was that high.

Looking at the options, F is 70%, I is 76%, and E is 90%. Hmm. I'm trying to recall if it was 76%. I think that might be the number from the Lokniti survey or something like that. Wait, wasn't there a specific survey by the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) around that time? I think they reported that a majority felt political parties were corrupt. 

Let me think about the context. After the Anna Hazare movement, there was a lot of public anger, so the numbers would likely be on the higher side. If the options include 76%, that's a strong majority. I'm pretty sure it's around there. So I think the answer is I: 76%.

I don't think it's 86% because that seems too high. Maybe 76% is more accurate. The other options like 50% or 66% are lower, so I'm leaning towards 76%.
