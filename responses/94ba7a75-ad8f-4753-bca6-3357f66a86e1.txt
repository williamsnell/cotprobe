Okay, so I've got this problem here about a resistor dissipating energy over time, and I need to figure out which option is correct. Let me try to think this through step by step.

Alright, the problem says it's a linear time-invariant resistor with a resistance of 4 ohms. The current through it is given by i(t) = sin(πt). They also mention that E(0) is 0, which I think refers to the energy at time zero being zero, which makes sense because at t=0, the current is sin(0)=0, so no energy would have been dissipated yet.

The question asks for the energy dissipated at t=1,2,3,4,5,6 seconds. So I need to find E(1), E(2), etc., and match the options given.

I remember that the energy dissipated in a resistor can be calculated using the integral of the power over time. Power in a resistor is given by P(t) = I(t)^2 * R. So the energy E(t) is the integral from 0 to t of P(t') dt', which is ∫0^t [i(t')^2 * R] dt'.

Let me write that formula down:

E(t) = R * ∫0^t [i(t')]^2 dt'

Given that i(t) = sin(πt), so i(t)^2 is sin²(πt). And R is 4 ohms.

So substituting, E(t) = 4 * ∫0^t [sin²(πt')] dt'

Hmm, I need to compute this integral. I remember there's a trigonometric identity that can simplify sin²(x). The identity is sin²(x) = (1 - cos(2x))/2. So let's apply that.

So,

E(t) = 4 * ∫0^t [ (1 - cos(2πt')) / 2 ] dt'

Simplify that, it becomes:

E(t) = 4 * [ (1/2) ∫0^t (1 - cos(2πt')) dt' ]

Which simplifies to:

E(t) = 2 * [ ∫0^t 1 dt' - ∫0^t cos(2πt') dt' ]

Calculating each integral separately.

First integral: ∫1 dt' from 0 to t is just t.

Second integral: ∫cos(2πt') dt'. The integral of cos(ax) is (1/a) sin(ax) + C. So here, a is 2π, so it becomes (1/(2π)) sin(2πt') evaluated from 0 to t.

So putting it all together:

E(t) = 2 [ t - (1/(2π)) [ sin(2πt) - sin(0) ] ]

But sin(0) is zero, so that term simplifies.

E(t) = 2 [ t - (1/(2π)) sin(2πt) ]

Let me rewrite that:

E(t) = 2t - (2/(2π)) sin(2πt) = 2t - (1/π) sin(2πt)

Wait, that seems correct. Let me check the units: t is in seconds, and energy is in joules if R is in ohms and current in amps. So this formula should give the energy in joules.

Now, I need to compute E(t) for t=1,2,3,4,5,6 seconds.

Let's compute each one.

For t=1:

E(1) = 2(1) - (1/π) sin(2π*1) = 2 - (1/π) sin(2π)

But sin(2π) is 0, so E(1) = 2 - 0 = 2 J.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E has E(1)=2J, E(2)=4J, etc. So maybe that's a possible candidate, but let me check more times to see if the pattern holds.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake here? Because when I think about the integral of sin² over a full period, perhaps the energy accumulates in a specific way.

Wait, let's compute E(t) at t=1,2,3, etc., using the formula I derived.

E(t) = 2t - (1/π) sin(2πt)

So let's compute each value:

t=1:
E(1)=2(1) - (1/π) sin(2π*1) = 2 - (1/π)(0) = 2 J.

t=2:
E(2)=2(2) - (1/π) sin(4π) =4 - 0=4 J.

t=3:
E(3)=6 - (1/π) sin(6π)=6 J.

t=4:
E(4)=8 - (1/π) sin(8π)=8 J.

Wait, but wait a minute, that's not matching any of the options. Let me check the options again.

Wait, option E says E(1)=2, E(2)=4, etc., which would imply E(t)=2t. But according to my calculation, that's what it is. So E(t)=2t. Therefore, for t=1 to 6, E(t) would be 2,4,6,8,10,12 J respectively.

Looking at the options, option E is exactly that: E(1)=2, E(2)=4, etc., up to 12 J at t=6.

But wait, before I settle on that, I should make sure that my integration was correct. Let me double-check.

E(t) = 4 * ∫0^t [sin²(πt')] dt'

Using sin² = (1 - cos(2πt'))/2.

So,

E(t) =4 * ∫ (1 - cos(2πt'))/2 dt' from 0 to t.

Which is 4*(1/2) ∫ (1 - cos(2πt')) dt' → 2 * [ t - (1/(2π)) sin(2πt) ] from 0 to t.

So yeah, it's 2t - (1/π) sin(2πt).

So at t=1, sin(2π*1)=0, so E=2*1=2 J.

t=2: 4 J.

But wait, let's think about the periodicity. The current i(t)=sin(πt) has a period of 2 seconds, because the period T=2π/(π)=2. So every 2 seconds, the function repeats.

The energy dissipation over each period would be the same, but wait, in this case, the energy E(t) is linear in t, which suggests that each second contributes 2 J. That seems a bit odd because when you have a sine wave, the power varies over time, so the energy should accumulate in a way that depends on the integral.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the integration. Let me recompute the integral.

Wait, let me compute E(t) again:

E(t) = 4 * ∫0^t [sin²(πt')] dt'

Using the identity, this becomes:

4 * ∫0^t [ (1 - cos(2π t')) / 2 ] dt' = 2 ∫0^t [1 - cos(2π t')] dt'

Which is 2 [ ∫0^t 1 dt' - ∫0^t cos(2π t') dt' ]

First integral: ∫1 dt' from 0 to t is t.

Second integral: ∫cos(2π t') dt' from 0 to t is [ (1/(2π)) sin(2π t') ] from 0 to t.

So,

E(t) = 2 [ t - (1/(2π)) ( sin(2π t) - sin(0) ) ]

Since sin(0)=0, this becomes E(t)=2 [ t - (1/(2π)) sin(2π t) ]

Simplify: E(t)=2t - (2/(2π)) sin(2π t) → E(t)=2t - (1/π) sin(2π t).

So that's correct.

Now, evaluating at t=1,2,3,4,5,6:

t=1: 2(1) - (1/π) sin(2π) = 2 - 0 = 2 J.

t=2: 4 - (1/π) sin(4π)=4 J.

t=3:6 - (1/π) sin(6π)=6 J.

t=4:8 - (1/π) sin(8π)=8 J.

t=5:10 - (1/π) sin(10π)=10 J.

t=6:12 - (1/π) sin(12π)=12 J.

So, the energy at each second is 2t J. So the values are 2,4,6,8,10,12 J respectively.

Looking at the options, option E matches exactly: E(1)=2, E(2)=4, etc., up to 12 J at t=6.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the energy might be the same each period, but according to this, it's linear. Hmm, perhaps because the average power is constant, leading to a linear accumulation of energy. Let me think about the average power.

The average power in a resistor for a sinusoidal current is (I_rms)^2 R.

The current here is i(t)=sin(πt), so its RMS value is (1/√2) because sin has a peak of 1, so RMS is 1/√2. So average power is (1/√2)^2 * 4 = (1/2)*4=2 W. So energy per second is 2 J, which matches the linear increase. So that makes sense.

Therefore, the correct option is E.
</think>

The energy dissipated in the resistor at each time t is calculated using the integral of the power over time. The power is given by \( P(t) = i(t)^2 \cdot R \), where \( i(t) = \sin(\pi t) \) and \( R = 4 \, \Omega \). The energy \( E(t) \) is:

\[
E(t) = 4 \int_0^t \sin^2(\pi t') \, dt'
\]

Using the trigonometric identity \( \sin^2(x) = \frac{1 - \cos(2x)}{2} \), the integral simplifies to:

\[
E(t) = 2 \left[ t - \frac{1}{2\pi} \sin(2\pi t) \right]
\]

Evaluating this at \( t = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \) seconds gives:

\[
E(1) = 2 \, \text{J}, \, E(2) = 4 \, \text{J}, \, E(3) = 6 \, \text{J}, \, E(4) = 8 \, \text{J}, \, E(5) = 10 \, \text{J}, \, E(6) = 12 \, \text{J}
\]

This matches option E, where the energy increases linearly with time.
