Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem is about a pressure vessel containing an inert gas. Initially, the temperature is 140°F and the pressure is 10 atm. Then the vessel is heated until the pressure becomes 20 atm. We need to find three things: a) q, the heat transfer per unit mass, b) ΔE, the change in total energy, and c) ΔH, the change in internal energy. The options are given as A through J, each with specific values.

Hmm, wait, the question says "heat transfer per unit mass," but the options are in Btu, which is a unit of energy, not per mass. Maybe it's a typo, and they actually mean heat transfer per pound mole? Or perhaps per unit mass as in per pound? I'm a bit confused, but maybe I'll proceed and see if it makes sense later.

First, I need to recall some thermodynamics principles. Since the gas is inert, I can probably assume it's ideal. For an ideal gas, the internal energy (U) depends only on temperature, not pressure or volume. Similarly, enthalpy (H) also depends only on temperature. So, if the temperature changes, U and H will change accordingly.

But wait, the problem doesn't give us the final temperature. It only tells us the initial temperature and the change in pressure. So I might need to find the final temperature using the ideal gas law, assuming the volume is constant because the vessel doesn't change size. Wait, but pressure vessels usually have fixed volume, so if the volume is constant, then for an ideal gas, PV = nRT. So if V is constant, P is proportional to T when n is constant (since n is given as one pound mole).

So initial state: P1 = 10 atm, T1 = 140°F. Final state: P2 = 20 atm, T2 = ?

Since V is constant, P1 / T1 = P2 / T2 → T2 = T1 * (P2 / P1) = 140°F * (20/10) = 280°F.

Wait, but temperature in the ideal gas law is absolute. Oh right! I should convert these Fahrenheit temperatures to Rankine because the ideal gas law uses absolute temperature. So 140°F is 140 + 459.67 = 600.67°R. Then T2 is 2*600.67 = 1201.34°R.

Now, let's think about the changes. The process is heating at constant volume, so work done is zero (since W = PΔV, and ΔV is zero). So the first law of thermodynamics, ΔU = q + W, becomes ΔU = q. Because W = 0.

But wait, ΔU is the change in internal energy, which for an ideal gas is also n*Cv*(T2 - T1). Since we're dealing with one pound mole (n=1), it's Cv*(T2 - T1). So I need to find Cv for the inert gas. Wait, but inert gases are monoatomic, like noble gases, so their Cv should be (3/2)R per mole. R is the gas constant in appropriate units.

Wait, but wait, the units here are in Btu. The gas constant R for air or similar is 1716 ft·lbf/(slug·°R), but I might need to convert it to Btu units. Alternatively, I can use the specific heat capacities in Btu per degree.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use specific heat capacities in Btu per mole per degree Fahrenheit, but that's unusual because in most cases, we use Kelvin or Rankine. Alternatively, maybe we can find the change in enthalpy and internal energy using the heat capacity at constant volume and pressure.

Wait, another approach: For an ideal gas, the enthalpy change ΔH = n*Cp*(T2 - T1), and the internal energy change ΔU = n*Cv*(T2 - T1). Also, since Cp = Cv + R, but I need to make sure the units are correct.

Wait, but let's think about the heat transfer q. Since the process is at constant volume, the heat transfer is equal to the change in internal energy. Because q = ΔU when V is constant. So q equals ΔU, which is n*Cv*(T2 - T1).

Wait, but the question is about per unit mass. Hmm, but the problem says "for one pound mole of the inert gas." So n is 1 lb·mol. So let's proceed.

First, calculate T1 and T2 in Rankine.

T1 = 140 + 459.67 = 600.67°R
T2 = 280 + 459.67 = 739.67°R

Wait, wait wait. 140°F is not 140+459.67. Wait, 0°C is 459.67°F, so 140°F is 140 + 459.67 = 600.67°R. Similarly, 280°F is 280 + 459.67 = 739.67°R.

So the temperature change ΔT is 739.67 - 600.67 = 139.0°R.

Now, for an ideal monoatomic gas, Cv is (3/2)R. But what is R in terms of Btu per mole per degree Rankine?

I remember that R is 10.732 ft·lbf/(lb·mol·°R), but I'm not sure about Btu. Alternatively, I can look up the value of R in Btu units.

Wait, 1 Btu is approximately 778 ft·lbf. So R in Btu units would be R = 10.732 ft·lbf/(lb·mol·°R) / 778 ft·lbf/Btu ≈ 0.0138 Btu/(lb·mol·°R).

So Cv = (3/2) * R = (3/2) * 0.0138 ≈ 0.0207 Btu/(lb·mol·°R).

Then, ΔU = n * Cv * ΔT = 1 * 0.0207 Btu/(lb·mol·°R) * 139.0 °R ≈ 2.8693 Btu.

Wait, that's way too small compared to the options, which are all in the thousands of Btu. So I must have made a mistake in the units somewhere.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of specific heats per mole. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using Cv in a different unit system.

Wait, another approach: For ideal gases, the change in internal energy and enthalpy can be calculated using the temperature change and the specific heat capacities. But since the problem is about a pound mole, perhaps per lb·mol.

Wait, let me check the specific heat capacities. For a monoatomic gas like noble gases, Cv is (3/2) R, and Cp is (5/2) R, but R is the gas constant.

Alternatively, perhaps using the value of R in Btu/(lb·mol·°R). Let me check: R is 10.732 ft·lbf/(lb·mol·°R). To convert ft·lbf to Btu, since 1 Btu ≈ 778 ft·lbf, R = 10.732 / 778 ≈ 0.0138 Btu/(lb·mol·°R).

So Cv = (3/2) * R = (3/2)*0.0138 ≈ 0.0207 Btu/(lb·mol·°R).

Then, ΔU = n * Cv * (T2 - T1) = 1 * 0.0207 * 139 ≈ 2.8693 Btu. But the options are in thousands of Btu, so that can't be right. I must have messed up the units.

Wait, maybe I should consider that 1 lb·mol is a large amount. Wait, no, the specific heats I'm using are per lb·mol. Wait, but perhaps I should use specific heat per unit mass instead. Because the question is about heat transfer per unit mass. Hmm, the problem says "heat transfer per unit mass," but the options are in Btu, which is energy. So perhaps it's per pound, so per unit mass.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using Cv in Btu per pound per degree. Let me think. For air, Cv is about 0.24 Btu/lb·°F. But for a monoatomic gas, Cv is lower. Let me check. Wait, for air, which is diatomic, Cv is about 0.24 Btu/lb·°F. For a monoatomic gas, it's approximately 0.17 Btu/lb·°F. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's better to use Cv in Btu per lb·mol·°R.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Since the process is at constant volume, the heat added is equal to the change in internal energy. So q = ΔU. But I need to find q per unit mass, but the options are per unit mass in Btu, so maybe per lb.

Wait, maybe I should compute the total q for the process and then divide by the mass. But first, let's compute the total heat transfer for the lb·mol, then find per lb.

Wait, let me first compute the change in temperature in Rankine: from 600.67 to 739.67, so ΔT = 139.0°R.

For an ideal gas, the internal energy change is ΔU = n * Cv * ΔT.

But I need the correct Cv. Let me think about Cv in Btu/(lb·mol·°R). As I calculated earlier, R is about 0.0138 Btu/(lb·mol·°R), so Cv is 0.0207 Btu/(lb·mol·°R).

So ΔU = 1 * 0.0207 * 139 ≈ 2.8693 Btu. That's the total change in internal energy for the lb·mol. But the options show much larger numbers, like 3540 Btu. So I must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Maybe Cv is in Btu per mole per degree, not per lb·mol. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the specific heat in different units.

Wait, another approach: The problem says "one pound mole," so maybe the specific heat is expressed per lb·mol. Let me check the specific heat capacity of a noble gas like helium or neon. For helium, Cv is about 0.126 Btu/(lb·mol·°F). Wait, but wait, that's per lb·mol and per degree Fahrenheit. So if I convert to Rankine, since ΔT is the same in Fahrenheit and Rankine scales, the heat capacity in Btu/(lb·mol·°R) would be the same as Btu/(lb·mol·°F) because the size of a degree is the same. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, Rankine and Fahrenheit have the same size degrees, but Rankine starts at absolute zero. So, the change in temperature is the same in both scales, so the ΔT in °F and °R are the same numerically. So, using Cv in Btu/(lb·mol·°F) would give the same result as Btu/(lb·mol·°R).

So if Cv is 0.126 Btu/(lb·mol·°F), then ΔU = 1 * 0.126 * 139 ≈ 17.514 Btu. Still way too low compared to the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm not using the correct specific heat. Maybe I should look up the specific heat capacity of an inert gas in Btu per lb·mol per degree.

Wait, another approach: For an ideal gas, q at constant volume is equal to ΔU. So q = n * Cv * ΔT.

But perhaps the problem expects us to use the heat capacity at constant pressure, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the process is not at constant volume. Wait, the problem says the vessel is heated until the pressure becomes 20 atm. If the vessel's volume is fixed, then the pressure increases because temperature increases. But if the vessel isn't rigid, the volume might change, but the problem doesn't say that. So I think it's safe to assume constant volume.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial temperature calculation. Let me double-check that.

Wait, 140°F to Rankine: 140 + 459.67 = 600.67°R. Correct.

When pressure doubles from 10 atm to 20 atm at constant volume, temperature doubles as well. So T2 = 2 * 600.67 = 1201.34°R. So ΔT = 1201.34 - 600.67 = 600.67°R? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, no. If P1 = 10 atm, T1 = 600.67°R, then P2 = 20 atm, so T2 = (P2/P1) * T1 = 2 * 600.67 = 1201.34°R. So ΔT is 1201.34 - 600.67 = 600.67°R.

Wait, that's a much bigger ΔT than I thought earlier. Oh no, I think I made a mistake earlier. I thought T2 was 280°F, but that's incorrect. Because P2 is 20 atm, so T2 is 2 * 600.67 = 1201.34°R, which is 1201.34 - 459.67 = 741.67°F. So the temperature change is 741.67 - 140 = 601.67°F. So ΔT is about 601.67°F or 601.67°R.

Wait, that makes more sense. So earlier, I thought T2 was 280°F, which was wrong. So the correct ΔT is about 601.67°R.

Now, let's recalculate ΔU.

Cv for a monoatomic gas is (3/2) R, where R is the gas constant in Btu/(lb·mol·°R). As I calculated earlier, R ≈ 0.0138 Btu/(lb·mol·°R), so Cv = 0.0207 Btu/(lb·mol·°R).

So ΔU = n * Cv * ΔT = 1 * 0.0207 * 601.67 ≈ 12.45 Btu. Still way too low compared to the options, which are in thousands of Btu.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong value for R. Let me check another source. I recall that R is 10.732 ft·lbf/(lb·mol·°R). To convert ft·lbf to Btu, divide by 778.169, so R ≈ 10.732 / 778.169 ≈ 0.0138 Btu/(lb·mol·°R). So that part seems correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is not about specific heat per lb·mol but per mole in terms of the gas's mass. Wait, but the problem states "one pound mole," which is a specific amount. So perhaps I need to consider the molecular weight. Wait, a pound mole is Avogadro's number of pounds, but that's not standard. Wait, no, a pound mole is the number of moles where one mole is the molecular weight in pounds. Wait, for example, for water, one mole is 18 grams, so a pound mole would be 18 grams per pound. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using Cv in Btu per lb·mol·°F, not per °R. Let me try that. If Cv is 0.0207 Btu/(lb·mol·°R), then per °F, it's the same because the size of the degree is the same. So 0.0207 Btu/(lb·mol·°F).

So ΔU = 0.0207 * 601.67 ≈ 12.45 Btu. Still the same as before.

But the options are in thousands. So I must be missing something. Maybe the problem is not at constant volume. Wait, the vessel's volume is fixed, so it's constant volume. So work is zero, and q = ΔU.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the specific heat in a different unit. Let me think about the specific heat in terms of Btu per mole per Kelvin. For helium, Cv is about 0.126 Btu/(lb·mol·°F). Wait, that's per °F, so per °R, it's the same.

Wait, perhaps I should use the heat capacity at constant pressure instead. No, at constant volume, q is ΔU.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the enthalpy change, ΔH, which is n*Cp*ΔT. Cp for a monoatomic gas is (5/2) R, which is 0.0235 Btu/(lb·mol·°R).

So ΔH = 1 * 0.0235 * 601.67 ≈ 14.15 Btu. Still way too low.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using Cv in a different way. Alternatively, maybe the vessel's volume isn't constant. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the vessel is rigid, so V is constant, and the process is isochoric. So q = ΔU. But the numbers are way off. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the specific heat in terms of per degree Celsius, but that shouldn't matter.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong value for Cv. Let me check another source. For helium, Cv is approximately 0.126 Btu per lb·mol per °F. So using that, ΔU = 0.126 * 601.67 ≈ 75.8 Btu. Still way lower than the options.

Wait, but the options are all in thousands of Btu. So perhaps the problem is not about one lb·mol, but about one mole. Let me check: if n is one mole, then R is about 8.314 J/(mol·K), but in Btu, that's about 0.00778 Btu/(mol·K). Then, Cv is (3/2)*8.314 ≈ 12.47 J/(mol·K) ≈ 0.01247 Btu/(mol·°R).

So ΔU = 1 * 0.01247 * 601.67 ≈ 7.5 Btu. Still way too low.

Hmm, I must be missing something. Let me think about the problem again. The vessel is heated until the pressure doubles, assuming volume is constant. So the temperature also doubles. So T2 = 2*T1.

Wait, but the initial temperature is 140°F. So T1 in Rankine is 140 + 459.67 = 600.67°R. So T2 is 1201.34°R. ΔT is 600.67°R.

Now, the change in internal energy for an ideal gas is ΔU = n*Cv*ΔT.

I think the problem is that I'm using Cv per lb·mol, but perhaps the problem is using Cv per mole, and the molecular weight is involved. Wait, for a lb·mol, the molecular weight would be in pounds per mole. So maybe I need to adjust Cv for that.

Wait, let's say the gas has a molecular weight of M pounds per lb·mol. Then, the molar mass is M lb per lb·mol. So the specific heat per unit mass would be Cv_m = Cv_molar / M.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using Cv in a different way, such as using the specific heat in Btu per pound per degree.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the specific heat capacity of the inert gas in Btu per pound per degree Fahrenheit. For example, helium has a specific heat capacity around 0.126 Btu/lb·mol·°F, but that's per lb·mol. So per pound, it would be 0.126 / M, where M is the molecular weight in lb per lb·mol.

Wait, the molecular weight of helium is 4 g/mol, which is 0.004 kg/mol. Converting to pounds, that's 0.004 * 2.20462 ≈ 0.0088 lb per lb·mol. So M = 0.0088 lb/lb·mol.

So Cv per pound would be 0.126 Btu/(lb·mol·°F) / 0.0088 lb/lb·mol ≈ 14.318 Btu/(lb·°F).

Now, ΔT is 601.67°F, so ΔU = Cv * ΔT = 14.318 * 601.67 ≈ 8,620 Btu per lb·mol.

Wait, but the problem states "for one pound mole," so the total ΔU would be 8,620 Btu. But looking at the options, the highest ΔE is 4610 Btu (option E), but this is 8,620, which isn't among the options. Hmm.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because I'm mixing units. Let me try another approach.

The heat capacity at constant volume for an ideal gas is Cv = (3/2) R. R is 10.732 ft·lbf/(lb·mol·°R). To convert that to Btu, since 1 Btu = 778 ft·lbf, R = 10.732 / 778 ≈ 0.0138 Btu/(lb·mol·°R).

So Cv = 0.0207 Btu/(lb·mol·°R).

ΔT is 600.67°R.

ΔU = 1 lb·mol * 0.0207 Btu/(lb·mol·°R) * 600.67°R ≈ 12.45 Btu.

This is the total change in internal energy for the lb·mol. But the options are much higher. So perhaps I'm missing a factor. Maybe the problem is using the specific heat at constant pressure instead? No, because at constant volume, q = ΔU.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is considering the heat transfer per unit mass, not per lb·mol. So if the lb·mol has a molecular weight M (lb per lb·mol), then the mass is M lb. So then, q per unit mass would be q = ΔU / mass.

So, for example, if M is 0.0088 lb (for helium), then the mass is 0.0088 lb. So q per lb would be 12.45 Btu / 0.0088 lb ≈ 1,414.77 Btu/lb.

But the options are in thousands of Btu, not per lb. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using Cv in Btu per mole per degree, and the lb·mol is converted to moles. Wait, a lb·mol is Avogadro's number of molecules, but the mass is the molar mass in pounds. So if the gas has a molecular weight of, say, 20 lb per lb·mol, then one lb·mol is 20 lb of the gas.

Wait, maybe the problem is using Cv in Btu per lb, so for a specific heat of 0.126 Btu/(lb·mol·°F), and if the molecular weight is, say, 20 lb per lb·mol, then the specific heat per lb would be 0.126 / 20 = 0.0063 Btu/(lb·°F).

Then, ΔU = 0.0063 * 601.67 ≈ 3.8 Btu. Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again. Option E says q = 3540 Btu, ΔE = 4610 Btu, ΔH_v =4610 Btu. Hmm.

Wait, ΔE is the change in total energy. For an ideal gas, the total energy is the internal energy, so ΔE = ΔU. So in option E, ΔE is 4610 Btu, which would be ΔU. Then q would be equal to ΔU, so q would be 4610 Btu. But option E says q is 3540 Btu, which doesn't match. So that can't be right.

Option A: q=4610, ΔE=3540, ΔH=3540. That can't be right because q should equal ΔU, which is ΔE.

Option D: q=4610, ΔE=4610, ΔH=3540. So q=ΔE=4610, which would imply that ΔH is different.

Wait, but in a constant volume process, q=ΔU. So if q is 4610, then ΔU is 4610. So ΔE should be 4610. Then in option D, ΔE is 4610, which matches. So maybe that's the right option.

But how do we get ΔH?

For ΔH, since H = U + PV, and for an ideal gas, H depends only on temperature. So ΔH = n*Cp*ΔT.

Cp for a monoatomic gas is (5/2) R. So Cp = 0.0235 Btu/(lb·mol·°R).

ΔH = 1 * 0.0235 * 600.67 ≈ 14.12 Btu. But that's way lower than the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using specific heat capacities in a different way. Another approach: The enthalpy change can be calculated as q_p (heat at constant pressure), but in this case, the process is not at constant pressure; it's at constant volume.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the relation ΔH = n*Cp*ΔT, and since in a constant volume process, the heat transfer is q = ΔU, but the enthalpy change is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relation between q, ΔU, and work done. Since work done W = PΔV, and in constant volume, W=0, so q=ΔU.

But the options don't seem to align with that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the specific heat in Btu per lb·mol per degree Celsius, but I'm not making progress.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the total heat transfer in the process. Suppose the pressure doubles, and the volume is constant. So the process is isochoric. The heat added is q = n*Cv*(T2 - T1).

But again, without the correct Cv, I can't get the numbers to match the options.

Wait, maybe the problem is using the specific heat in terms of Btu per mole per degree, but I'm using per lb·mol. Let me try that.

If Cv is 0.0207 Btu/(lb·mol·°R), and molecular weight M is, say, 20 lb per lb·mol, then Cv per mole would be 0.0207 * 20 = 0.414 Btu/(mol·°R).

Then, ΔU = 1 mol * 0.414 * 600.67 ≈ 248.9 Btu. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using Cv in a different way. Let me think about the heat capacities in terms of Btu per pound per degree.

If the specific heat capacity per pound is, say, 0.126 Btu/(lb·°F), then for a ΔT of 601.67°F, the heat transfer per pound would be 0.126 * 601.67 ≈ 75.8 Btu/lb.

But if the lb·mol has a mass of, say, 20 lb, then total q would be 75.8 * 20 ≈ 1516 Btu. Still not matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using the specific heat at constant pressure, but that doesn't make sense at constant volume.

Wait, another thought: The problem states "heat transfer per unit mass," but the options are in thousands of Btu. So maybe the unit is per lb·mol, not per lb. So if the heat transfer is 3540 Btu per lb·mol, that would make sense.

Wait, let's calculate ΔU again with that in mind. If ΔU = 3540 Btu, then Cv would be 3540 / 600.67 ≈ 5.9 Btu/(lb·mol·°R). But that's way higher than the Cv I calculated earlier, which was 0.0207 Btu/(lb·mol·°R). So that's not possible.

I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again. The only option where q equals ΔE is option D, where q=4610 and ΔE=4610. So if that's the case, then ΔU=4610, which would mean Cv is 4610 / 600.67 ≈ 7.67 Btu/(lb·mol·°R), which is way too high.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the specific heat in a different way. Another approach: The enthalpy change for an ideal gas is ΔH = n*Cp*ΔT. Cp is (5/2) R, which is 0.0235 Btu/(lb·mol·°R).

So ΔH = 1 * 0.0235 * 600.67 ≈ 14.12 Btu. But that's not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the relation between q and ΔH. At constant pressure, q = ΔH. But this process is at constant volume, so q = ΔU. So the only way q and ΔH would be the same is if the process were at constant pressure, which it's not.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the wrong approach and thinks that q = ΔH. But that's only true for constant pressure processes.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the specific heat at constant pressure instead of volume. But that would be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula q = n*Cv*ΔT, but using Cp instead. Let me see.

If I take Cp = 0.0235 Btu/(lb·mol·°R), then q = 1 * 0.0235 * 600.67 ≈ 14.12 Btu. Still not matching.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider that the problem is using the molar specific heat in J/(mol·K) and then converting to Btu. Let's try that.

For a monoatomic gas, Cv = (3/2) R, where R = 8.314 J/(mol·K). So Cv = 12.47 J/(mol·K) = 12.47 / 1000 = 0.01247 kJ/(mol·K) ≈ 0.00385 Btu/(mol·°R).

Then, ΔT = 600.67°R.

ΔU = 1 mol * 0.00385 Btu/(mol·°R) * 600.67 ≈ 2.32 Btu. Still way off.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the specific heat in terms of Btu per pound per degree, and the molecular weight is involved. Let me try that.

Assume the molecular weight M is 20 lb per lb·mol. Then, Cv for the lb·mol is (3/2) R, where R = 10.732 ft·lbf/(lb·mol·°R) = 10.732 / 778 ≈ 0.0138 Btu/(lb·mol·°R).

So Cv = 0.0207 Btu/(lb·mol·°R). ΔT = 600.67°R.

ΔU = 1 * 0.0207 * 600.67 ≈ 12.45 Btu.

Now, the mass is M = 20 lb per lb·mol, so q per lb is 12.45 / 20 ≈ 0.6225 Btu/lb. But the options are in thousands of Btu, so this can't be right.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe the problem expects us to use the ideal gas law to find the number of moles and then compute the heat transfer.

Wait, let's try that. The initial pressure is 10 atm, temperature 140°F (600.67°R), volume V.

n = PV/(RT). But since V is constant, and we're dealing with one lb·mol, perhaps n=1 lb·mol.

Wait, but V isn't given, so maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the fact that for an ideal gas, q = n*Cv*ΔT, and the options are based on Cv being approximately 20.8 Btu/(lb·mol·°R). Because 0.0207 * 1000 = 20.7, which is close to 20.8. Wait, that would make ΔU = 20.8 * 600.67 ≈ 12,500 Btu, which is way higher than the options.

Wait, but maybe the problem is using Cv in Btu/(lb·mol·°F) as 20.8. So ΔU = 20.8 * 600.67 ≈ 12,500 Btu. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using Cv as 3540 Btu/(lb·mol·°F), which would make ΔU = 3540 * 600.67, which is way too high.

I think I'm stuck because none of my calculations are matching the options. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the work done. But since the vessel's volume is constant, work is zero, so q=ΔU.

Alternatively, perhaps the vessel is not rigid, and the pressure increases because both temperature and volume change. But the problem states that the vessel is heated, implying that volume might not change.

Wait, another thought: The problem might be using the enthalpy change instead of internal energy. But at constant volume, q=ΔU, not ΔH.

Wait, looking at the options again, option E says q=3540, ΔE=4610, ΔH=4610. So ΔE=ΔU=4610, which would imply q=4610. But option E says q=3540, which contradicts.

Option D: q=4610, ΔE=4610, ΔH=3540. So q=ΔE, which matches. But ΔH is 3540.

So perhaps in this case, ΔU=4610, which would require Cv = 4610 / 600.67 ≈7.67 Btu/(lb·mol·°R), which is way higher than the correct value. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relation between q and the enthalpy change. Wait, at constant pressure, q_p = ΔH. But here, it's constant volume, so q_v = ΔU.

I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try to find which option has q=ΔU and see if it makes sense.

Looking at the options:

A: q=4610, ΔE=3540 → q≠ΔE. Not possible.

B: q=3800, ΔE=4200 → no.

C: q=5000, ΔE=4000 → no.

D: q=4610, ΔE=4610 → yes, q=ΔE. So possible.

E: q=3540, ΔE=4610 → no.

F: q=4610, ΔE=4610, ΔH=4610 → all same.

G: q=3000, ΔE=3000 → possible.

H: q=4200, ΔE=3100 → no.

I: q=3540, ΔE=3540 → yes.

J: q=4000, ΔE=3500 → no.

So options D, G, and I have q=ΔE.

Now, for an ideal gas, ΔH = ΔU + Δ(PV). Since PV = nRT, and for an ideal gas, H = U + PV. So ΔH = ΔU + nRΔT.

So ΔH = ΔU + nRΔT.

n=1 lb·mol, R=0.0138 Btu/(lb·mol·°R), ΔT=600.67°R.

ΔH = 4610 + 0.0138 * 600.67 ≈ 4610 + 8.29 ≈ 4618 Btu. None of the options match that.

Wait, but option D says ΔH=3540, which is much lower. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for R. Let me check another source. R is often given as 10.732 ft·lbf/(lb·mol·°R), which converts to about 0.0138 Btu/(lb·mol·°R).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the specific heat in a different way, such as using the relation between heat capacities: Cp - Cv = R.

So if I know ΔU and ΔH, ΔH = ΔU + nRΔT.

In option D, ΔU=4610, so ΔH=4610 + 0.0138 * 600.67 ≈ 4610 + 8.3 ≈ 4618 Btu. But option D says ΔH=3540, which doesn't match.

Similarly, for option I: q=3540, ΔE=3540. So ΔH=3540 + 8.3 ≈ 3548 Btu. But option I says ΔH=4610, which again doesn't match.

So none of the options seem to fit the calculations. But since in a constant volume process, q=ΔU, the only options where q=ΔE are D, G, and I. Among these, option D has q=4610, which would be the only one where q=ΔE. But I don't know how to get that number.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the correct units for R. Let me try R in different units. If R is 8.314 kJ/(kmol·K), but I don't think that's helpful here.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using Cv as 5/2 R, which is Cp, but that would be wrong.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the specific heat in Btu per mole per degree, but I'm using per lb·mol. Let me try that.

If Cv = 0.0207 Btu/(lb·mol·°R), and the molecular weight is M lb per lb·mol, then per mole, it's Cv_m = Cv * M.

So if M is, say, 20 lb per lb·mol, then Cv_m = 0.0207 * 20 = 0.414 Btu/(mol·°R).

ΔU = 1 mol * 0.414 * 600.67 ≈ 248.9 Btu. Still not matching.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for the answer that has q=ΔE and see which one aligns with the possible calculations. Option D has q=4610 and ΔE=4610, which would mean ΔU=4610. Then, using Cv = ΔU / ΔT = 4610 / 600.67 ≈7.67 Btu/(lb·mol·°R), which is way higher than the correct value. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the specific heat in a different way, such as using the relation between heat capacities. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the enthalpy change as the heat transfer. But at constant volume, q=ΔU, not ΔH.

Wait, another thought: The problem might be considering the pressure change and using the relation PV = nRT, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for heat transfer in terms of pressure and volume changes, but I'm not familiar with that.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the process is not isochoric. Maybe the vessel isn't rigid, and the volume changes. But the problem states it's a pressure vessel, which usually implies rigid walls, so volume is constant.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. The only option where q=ΔE is option D, G, or I. Among these, option D has the highest values, which might make sense if the specific heat is much higher than I calculated. But I can't see why that would be the case.

So, perhaps the answer is option E, where q=3540, ΔE=4610, ΔH=4610. But that would imply that q≠ΔE, which contradicts the first law for a constant volume process.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the specific heat in a different unit, such as per degree Celsius instead of Rankine. But that shouldn't change the numerical value since the size of the degree is the same.

Wait, another approach: If the pressure doubles at constant volume, the temperature also doubles. So the heat added is q = n*Cv*(T2 - T1) = n*Cv*T1.

Wait, n is 1 lb·mol.

So q = Cv * T1.

If Cv is 0.0207 Btu/(lb·mol·°R), and T1 is 600.67°R, then q = 0.0207 * 600.67 ≈ 12.45 Btu. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using Cv in Btu per lb per degree. If Cv is 0.126 Btu/(lb·mol·°F), then per lb, it's 0.126 / molecular weight.

Assuming molecular weight M is 20 lb per lb·mol, then per lb, Cv is 0.126 / 20 ≈ 0.0063 Btu/(lb·°F).

q per lb = 0.0063 * 600.67 ≈ 3.79 Btu/lb.

But the problem says "heat transfer per unit mass," so if the mass is, say, 20 lb, then total q would be 3.79 * 20 ≈75.8 Btu. Still not matching.

I think I'm stuck and will have to make an educated guess. The only option where q=ΔE is D, so I'll go with that.

The problem involves a pressure vessel containing an inert gas at 140°F and 10 atm, which is heated until the pressure reaches 20 atm. The goal is to calculate the heat transfer per unit mass (q), the change in total energy (ΔE), and the change in internal energy (ΔH) for one pound mole of the gas. 

Key steps and considerations:

1. **Assumptions and Ideal Gas Behavior**: The gas is assumed to be ideal, meaning its internal energy (U) and enthalpy (H) depend only on temperature, not pressure or volume. The vessel is rigid, implying constant volume (V).

2. **Temperature Conversion**: The initial temperature (T₁) is 140°F, which converts to 600.67°R. Since pressure doubles from 10 atm to 20 atm at constant volume, the final temperature (T₂) is 1201.34°R. The temperature change (ΔT) is 600.67°R.

3. **First Law of Thermodynamics**: For a constant volume process, work (W) is zero, so the heat transfer (q) equals the change in internal energy (ΔU):  
   \[
   q = \Delta U
   \]

4. **Specific Heat Capacity**: For an ideal monoatomic gas, the molar heat capacity at constant volume (\(C_v\)) is \((3/2)R\), where \(R = 0.0138 \, \text{Btu/(lb·mol·°R)}\). This gives \(C_v = 0.0207 \, \text{Btu/(lb·mol·°R)}\).

5. **Calculations**:
   - Internal energy change:  
     \[
     \Delta U = n \cdot C_v \cdot \Delta T = 1 \cdot 0.0207 \cdot 600.67 \approx 12.45 \, \text{Btu}
     \]
     This result is orders of magnitude smaller than the options provided, indicating a potential mismatch in units or assumptions.

6. **Analysis of Options**: The options suggest much larger values for q, ΔE, and ΔH. Among the options, only those where \(q = \Delta E\) (consistent with \(q = \Delta U\) at constant volume) are viable. These are options D, G, and I.

7. **Final Selection**: Option D (\(q = 4610 \, \text{Btu}\), \(\Delta E = 4610 \, \text{Btu}\), \(\Delta H = 3540 \, \text{Btu}\)) aligns with the condition \(q = \Delta E\), even though the calculated values are significantly smaller. This discrepancy suggests the problem may use a different interpretation or scaling of specific heat capacities.
