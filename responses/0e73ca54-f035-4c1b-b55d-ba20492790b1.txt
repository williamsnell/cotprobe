Okay, so I have this question about the energy released from breaking down high-energy phosphates like ATP and phosphocreatine and how long it can sustain maximal exertion exercise. Hmm, I remember that ATP is the primary energy source for muscle cells. When you exercise really hard, like sprinting or lifting heavy weights, your muscles use ATP quickly because it's the immediate energy source.

I think ATP only has a small amount stored in the muscles, so it doesn't last very long. I've heard that ATP gets depleted in just a few seconds. Like, maybe 2-3 seconds at most when doing something really intense. But wait, what about phosphocreatine? I think phosphocreatine can help regenerate ATP. So together, maybe they can last a bit longer than just ATP alone.

So if ATP lasts about 2 seconds and phosphocreatine helps a bit, maybe the combined effect is a little longer, but not by much. I've heard that the ATP-PC system can sustain maximal effort for about 10-15 seconds. But wait, the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Options are A through J. The options given are in various time frames. Let me look: A is 20-30 minutes, which is way too long. B is 1-2 seconds, that's too short. C is 10-15 minutes, no. D is 30-40 seconds. E is 90-100 seconds. F is 50-60 seconds. G is 70-80 seconds. H is 5-10 seconds. I is 1-2 hours, no. J is 2-3 minutes.

Wait, I thought the ATP-PC system lasts about 10 seconds. So looking at the options, H is 5-10 seconds, which might fit. Or maybe D is 30-40 seconds, which is a bit longer than what I remember. Alternatively, I think that during maximal exertion, like a 100m sprint, it's powered mainly by ATP-PC, and that lasts about 10 seconds. After that, the body switches to anaerobic glycolysis, which is less efficient and produces lactic acid.

So if the question is about the breakdown of ATP and phosphocreatine, which are part of the ATP-PC system, then the time is probably around 10 seconds. But looking at the options, H is 5-10 seconds, which would include 10 seconds. Alternatively, some sources might say up to 30 seconds, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the ATP-PC system can sustain about 10 seconds of very high-intensity activity. So the closest option would be H:5-10 seconds. But I've also read that it can be up to 30 seconds for less intense but still high exertion. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.

Let me think again. ATP is used quickly, in about 2-3 seconds. Phosphocreatine can regenerate some ATP, but it's not a huge amount. So maybe together, they last around 10 seconds, which would be option H. Or maybe some sources say it's around 30 seconds. I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe the question is more about ATP alone, which would be 2-3 seconds, but that's not one of the options. The options are B:1-2 seconds, H:5-10. So perhaps the answer is H, 5-10 seconds. Or maybe the breakdown of both ATP and phosphocreatine can last longer.

Wait, another thought: phosphocreatine is broken down to make more ATP, so the system might last a bit longer than just ATP. Maybe around 15 seconds or so. But the options don't have 15 seconds. The closest higher would be E:90-100 seconds, which is way too long. Or D:30-40 seconds, which is longer than I thought.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should recall that during high-intensity exercise, the ATP-PC system is used for the first 10 seconds or so, and then glycolysis takes over. So if the question is about the duration that ATP and phosphocreatine can sustain maximal exertion, it's around 10 seconds. So H is 5-10, which would include that.

Wait, but sometimes sources say that the ATP-PC system can support activity for about 10-15 seconds. So maybe the answer is H, 5-10, but some sources say up to 15. But the options don't have 15. Alternatively, maybe the answer is H, 5-10 seconds, because that's the range that includes 10.

Alternatively, perhaps it's 30-40 seconds. I'm a bit confused. I think I might have to go with what I know: ATP lasts about 2-3 seconds, and with phosphocreatine, maybe up to 10 seconds. So the answer would be H:5-10 seconds.

The energy released from the breakdown of ATP and phosphocreatine, which are part of the ATP-PC system, is used to sustain maximal exertion exercise. ATP is quickly depleted, typically within 2-3 seconds, while phosphocreatine helps regenerate ATP, extending the duration slightly. Together, the ATP-PC system can sustain maximal exertion for approximately 10 seconds. Among the given options, the closest range is H: 5-10 seconds.

Answer: H
