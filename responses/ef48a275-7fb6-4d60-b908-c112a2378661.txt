Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about deep learning models, specifically Highway Networks and ResNets, and also DenseNets. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down.

The question has two statements, and I need to evaluate whether each is true or false, then pick the correct option from A to J.

Let's start with Statement 1: "Highway networks were introduced after ResNets and eschew max pooling in favor of convolutions."

I remember that Highway Networks were introduced by some researchers, maybe in 2015? I think ResNets came out earlier, around 2015 as well, but wait, Highway Networks were actually introduced earlier. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think. I recall that ResNets were a breakthrough in 2015, and Highway Networks came a bit before that. So if Statement 1 says Highway networks were introduced after ResNets, that would be false. Because Highway Networks were before ResNets, right? Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. No, I'm getting mixed up. Wait, I think Highway Networks came in 2015, same year as ResNets. Or maybe ResNets came a bit later. Hmm, I'm not too sure about the exact timelines. Alternatively, maybe it's that Highway Networks were proposed by another team, and ResNets by He et al. I think ResNets came after Highway Networks, but I might be wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the key point is whether Highway Networks use max pooling or not.

Wait, no, the statement says Highway networks eschew max pooling in favor of convolutions. So, do Highways use max pooling? From what I remember, Highway Networks do use池化, but maybe they don't use max pooling as much. Or perhaps they rely more on the convolutions for downsampling. Wait, I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the Highway Networks do use max pooling, so the statement would be incorrect if that's the case. So if Statement 1 is claiming that Highways don't use max pooling, but they actually do, then that part is false.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the max pooling part. I think ResNets do use max pooling in their initial layers, but maybe Highways don't. Alternatively, perhaps they use average pooling instead. Hmm.

Moving on to Statement 2: "DenseNets usually cost more memory than ResNets."

DenseNets connect every layer to every subsequent layer, which increases the number of parameters and computations. So, in terms of memory usage, I think DenseNets require more memory because each layer depends on all previous layers, leading to more activations stored during forward and backward passes. So Statement 2 would be true.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. I remember that memory usage can vary based on the implementation and the exact architecture details. But generally, DenseNets have more connections, which could mean higher memory usage compared to ResNets, which have a more linear structure.

So, putting it together:

Statement 1: If Highway Networks were introduced after ResNets, that's false because I think they were introduced before. Or wait, maybe I'm wrong about the timeline. Alternatively, perhaps the key point is the max pooling part. If Highways don't use max pooling, then that part is correct. But I'm not certain.

Wait, I should double-check the timeline. Let me think: Highway Networks were proposed in 2015 by Sermanet and colleagues, and ResNets were introduced in the same year by He et al. So they were contemporaneous, but I think ResNets came a bit later. Alternatively, maybe the order is that Highway Networks came after ResNets. No, I think Highway Networks were proposed earlier than ResNets. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. I think ResNets were introduced in 2015, and Highway Networks were earlier, maybe 2014 or 2015. Alternatively, perhaps they came around the same time. So the first part of Statement 1 might be false because ResNets came after Highways, or maybe it's true if Highways came after. I'm not sure.

If the first part of Statement 1 is true (Highways after ResNets), then the second part (eschew max pooling) would need to be true. But if Highways do use max pooling, then the statement is false.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct point is that Highway Networks do not use max pooling, relying instead on convolutions for downsampling. So maybe the first part is false, because Highways were before ResNets, but the second part is true. Or maybe the first part is true, but the second part is false.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let's try to approach each statement one by one.

Statement 1: Highway networks were introduced after ResNets.

From what I can recall, the Highway Networks paper was published in 2015, and ResNets were also published in 2015. So perhaps they were introduced around the same time, but maybe ResNets came later. Alternatively, I might be mixing up the timelines. I think that ResNets were a later development, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the exact order isn't crucial for this question, and the key point is the max pooling part.

The second part: eschew max pooling in favor of convolutions.

In Highway Networks, I believe they use a different approach for downsampling. Instead of using max pooling, they use a convolutional layer with a stride. So the statement would be correct in that aspect. So if the first part of Statement 1 is true, then the whole statement is true. But if the first part is false (Highways were before ResNets), then the whole statement is false.

Wait, but I think Highway Networks were actually introduced before ResNets. So the first part of Statement 1 would be false. Because ResNets came after, so Highways were not introduced after ResNets. So Statement 1 would be false.

Then Statement 2: DenseNets usually cost more memory than ResNets.

As I thought earlier, DenseNets have more connections, so they might use more memory. So Statement 2 is true.

So putting it together:

Statement 1: False

Statement 2: True

Looking at the options, that would be option J: False, True.

Wait, but let me make sure about the timeline. Let me check:

Highway Networks were introduced in 2015 (Sermanet et al.), and ResNets were also in 2015, but perhaps the ResNet paper was published later in the year. So it's possible that Highway Networks came before ResNets. If that's the case, then Statement 1's first part is false. So the entire Statement 1 is false because it says Highways were after ResNets, which is incorrect.

So Statement 1 is False, and Statement 2 is True. So the answer would be J: False, True.
</think>

The first statement incorrectly claims that Highway Networks were introduced after ResNets. In reality, Highway Networks were introduced before ResNets, making the first part of the statement false. Additionally, Highway Networks do not use max pooling; they rely on convolutions for downsampling, making the second part of the statement true. However, since the first part is false, the entire first statement is false.

The second statement correctly asserts that DenseNets generally consume more memory than ResNets due to their dense connectivity, which increases the number of parameters and computations.

Given these evaluations, the correct answer is:

J: False, True

Answer: J
