Okay, so I have this question about Mr. Wingate's automobile insurance. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The problem says his insurance costs $173.50 per year, and his policy was canceled 115 days after it went into effect. The question is asking how much his refund would be in two scenarios: (a) if he canceled the policy, and (b) if the insurance company canceled it. The options are from A to J, but the options provided are A to D, each with two numbers.

First, I need to understand the difference between the two scenarios. I think when the policyholder (Mr. Wingate) cancels it, the refund might be different than if the company cancels it. Maybe one involves prorating the premium, and the other doesn't? Or perhaps one has a different calculation method.

So, the total annual premium is $173.50. The policy was in effect for 115 days. I should calculate how much of the year that is. There are 365 days in a year, right? So 115 days is 115/365 of the year. Let me compute that fraction.

115 divided by 365. Let me do the math: 365 ÷ 5 is 73, so 115 is 5×23, but wait, 365 ÷ 5 is 73, so 115 is 5*23, but maybe it's easier to just compute 115/365. Let me see: 115 ÷ 365. Well, 365 × 0.3 = 109.5, because 365 × 0.3 is 109.5, right? So 115 is a bit more than 0.3. Let me compute 115 ÷ 365 exactly.

Alternatively, let's compute 115/365. Since both can be divided by 5: 115 ÷5=23, 365 ÷5=73. So it's 23/73. Let me compute 23 divided by 73. Let's see: 73 × 0.315 ≈ 23, because 73 × 0.3 is 21.9, so 0.315 times 73 is about 23. So approximately 0.315 of the year.

So, the fraction of the year is about 0.315. Now, the annual premium is $173.50. So the portion already covered is 0.315 × 173.50. Let me calculate that.

0.3 × 173.50 = 52.05, and 0.015 ×173.50 = 2.6025. Adding them gives 52.05 + 2.6025 = 54.6525. So about $54.65. So if he paid for the full year but only used it for 115 days, he's entitled to a refund of the unused portion, which is $173.50 - $54.65 = $118.85. Wait, but that's if he's the one canceling. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, maybe I have this backwards. Let me think. If the policy was canceled after 115 days, the time covered is 115 days, so the premium paid for that time would be (115/365)*173.50, which is about $54.65, as I calculated. So if he paid the full year upfront, the refund would be the remaining portion, which is 173.50 -54.65= $118.85. But if the company cancels the policy, maybe they don't prorate it and just give back the unused portion, or perhaps they prorate differently.

Wait, but the question is about refunds. So when you cancel, the refund depends on whether the cancellation is by the policyholder or the company. I think if the policyholder cancels, they might get a prorated refund. But if the company cancels, they might give a full refund or perhaps a different calculation.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. Typically, if the policyholder cancels, they might be entitled to a prorated refund for the time already covered. So for 115 days, they paid for a portion, and the rest is refundable. So the refund would be the total premium minus the portion used. So 173.50 - (115/365)*173.50 = 173.50*(1 - 115/365) = 173.50*(250/365). Let me compute that: 250/365 is approximately 0.6849. So 173.50 * 0.6849 ≈ 173.50 * 0.6849.

Alternatively, 173.50 * (250/365) = 173.50 * (50/73) because 250 ÷5=50, 365 ÷5=73. So 173.50 ÷73 is approximately 2.3767. Then 2.3767 *50 = 118.835, which is about $118.84.

Wait, but that's the calculation for the refund if the policyholder cancels. But the options show that for (a) and (b), the numbers are different. So scenario (a) is when he cancels, and (b) when the company cancels.

Wait, perhaps when the policyholder cancels, the refund is prorated, but when the company cancels, they might give a different treatment. Maybe the company would prorate as well, but perhaps there's a different method, like giving back the full premium minus the pro rata part, but that seems the same. Or maybe the company could have a different calculation, like giving a full refund because they're the ones canceling.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. If the company cancels, perhaps they prorate the amount, but maybe they don't charge any fees, so the refund is the same as the prorated amount. Or perhaps the policyholder's cancellation has a different calculation.

Alternatively, maybe when the policyholder cancels, the refund is calculated based on the remaining time, but the company's cancellation might involve a different approach, like giving a partial refund based on the days remaining.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.

Total premium: $173.50 for 365 days.

Policy in effect for 115 days. So the portion used is 115/365 * 173.50 ≈ $54.65. So the refund should be the remaining amount, which is 173.50 -54.65 = $118.85.

But looking at the options, option D is $100.63 and $118.84. So for (a) when he cancels, it's $100.63, and (b) when the company cancels, it's $118.84. Hmm, that's interesting.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe when the policyholder cancels, they are charged a fee or something, so the refund is less. Let me think about that. Or perhaps the calculation is based on a different method, like monthly proration.

Wait, another approach: the premium is $173.50 per year. So per month, that's 173.50 /12 ≈ $14.4583 per month.

If the policy was in effect for 115 days, that's 115/30 ≈ 3.833 months. So 3 full months and 25 days. So 3 months would be 3 *14.4583 ≈ $43.375. The remaining 25 days would be 25/30 *14.4583 ≈ 1.6667 *14.4583 ≈ $24.097. So total for 3.833 months is about $43.375 + $24.097 ≈ $67.47. So the refund would be 173.50 -67.47 ≈ $106.03. But that doesn't match any of the options exactly. Hmm.

Wait, but the options don't have $106.03. Let me check the options again. Option C is $72.87 and $54.66. Option D is $100.63 and $118.84. So maybe my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the refund is calculated based on the exact fraction of the year. So 115 days is 115/365 of the year. So the amount used is 115/365 *173.50. Let me compute that accurately.

115/365 = 0.31507 (exactly). So 0.31507 *173.50 = let's compute:

173.50 *0.3 =52.05
173.50 *0.01507 = let's compute 173.50 *0.015 =2.6025, and 173.50 *0.00007= approximately 0.012145. So total is 52.05 +2.6025=54.6525 +0.012145 ≈54.6646. So about $54.66.

So the amount used is $54.66, so the refund would be 173.50 -54.66= $118.84.

So if the policy was canceled by the policyholder, the refund would be $118.84. But looking at the options, option D for (b) is $118.84, so that's when the company cancels. Hmm, but why would the company canceling give a different refund?

Wait, perhaps when the policyholder cancels, they get the pro rata refund, which is $54.66, but that doesn't make sense because the refund should be the remaining amount. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the refund is the amount not used. So if the policy was in effect for 115 days, the amount used is 115/365 *173.50 = $54.66, so the refund is $173.50 -54.66= $118.84.

But in the options, (a) is when he cancels, and (b) when the company cancels. So perhaps when the policyholder cancels, the refund is $118.84, and when the company cancels, the refund is also $118.84? But that would match option D as (118.84 for both). But option D has (a) as $100.63 and (b) as $118.84.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe when the policyholder cancels, they have to pay a fee or something, so the refund is less. Alternatively, perhaps the company's cancellation doesn't prorate and gives a different calculation.

Wait, perhaps if the policy is canceled by the company, they might give a full refund, but that doesn't make sense because the policy was in effect for 115 days. So they should prorate.

Alternatively, maybe the company's calculation is different. Let me think about another approach: maybe the company uses a different method to calculate the refund. For example, they might prorate based on the exact days, but perhaps subtract a service fee or something.

Wait, perhaps when the policyholder cancels, the refund is calculated as (365 -115)/365 * premium, which is 250/365 *173.50= $118.84. That's what I calculated earlier. So (a) would be $118.84.

But the options don't have that. Looking back, option D is (a) $100.63 and (b) $118.84. So for (a), the refund is $100.63, and for (b), it's $118.84.

Wait, maybe when the policyholder cancels, they are charged a cancellation fee or something, so the refund is less. Let me think: perhaps the company keeps a fee regardless. So if the policy is canceled by the policyholder, they might keep a fee, say, $100.63, and the rest is the refund. But that seems too high.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the premium is calculated monthly, and the policy was in effect for 3 full months (30 days each) plus 25 days. So 3 months would be 3*(173.50/12)= 3*14.4583≈$43.375. The 25 days would be 25/30 *14.4583≈$11.714. So total for 115 days is about $43.375 + $11.714≈$55.09. So refund would be 173.50 -55.09≈$118.41, which is close to $118.84, but not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the company prorates the premium for the days used and gives the rest as a refund. So for 115 days, the amount used is 115/365 *173.50≈$54.66, so the refund is $173.50 -54.66≈$118.84.

But why would the answer have different amounts for (a) and (b)? Maybe when the company cancels, they don't prorate and give a full refund, but that doesn't make sense because the policy was already in effect for 115 days.

Wait, perhaps the company's cancellation doesn't require prorating, so they give the full premium back. But that can't be right because the policy was active for 115 days.

Alternatively, maybe when the company cancels, they prorate the premium for the days used, so the refund is the same as when the policyholder cancels, but that's the same amount.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again.

Option C: $72.87 and $54.66. Wait, $54.66 is the amount used, so the refund would be 173.50 -54.66=118.84. So for (a), if he cancels, perhaps the refund is $118.84, and for (b), if the company cancels, maybe they give the amount used as a credit, which is $54.66, but that doesn't align with the options.

Alternatively, perhaps when the policyholder cancels, they get the amount used, and the company cancels, they get the remaining. But that seems opposite.

Wait, no, the refund should be the amount not used. So if the policy was in effect for 115 days, the refund is the remaining time's worth of premium. So $118.84.

Looking back at the options, option D is (a) $100.63 and (b) $118.84. So for (a), the refund is $100.63, and for (b), it's $118.84.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is different. Maybe the company uses a 360-day year for calculations. So 115/360 *173.50= (115/360)*173.50.

Let me compute that: 115 ÷360≈0.3194. 0.3194 *173.50≈55.56. So the refund would be 173.50 -55.56≈117.94, which is close to $118.84, but not exact. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the company calculates the refund based on a different method, like monthly proration without partial months. So 115 days is 3 full months (90 days) plus 25 days. They might charge for the full months and prorate the remaining days.

So 3 months: 3*(173.50/12)=3*14.4583≈43.375. 25 days is 25/30 of a month, so 25/30 *14.4583≈11.714. So total paid is 43.375 +11.714≈55.089. So the refund would be 173.50 -55.089≈118.41, which is approximately $118.41, close to $118.84.

But again, the options don't have $118.41, but option D has $118.84 for (b).

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when the policy is canceled by the company, they might prorate based on the exact days, but when the policyholder cancels, they might have a different method, like giving a partial refund based on the days remaining.

Alternatively, perhaps when the company cancels, they prorate and give the exact pro rata refund, which is $118.84, and when the policyholder cancels, they give a different amount, perhaps less because of a cancellation fee.

But the question doesn't mention any fees, so I think the refund should be based purely on proration.

Wait, perhaps the options are reversed. Maybe (a) is when the company cancels, and (b) is when the policyholder cancels. But the question states (a) he canceled, (b) the company canceled.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck:

173.50 * (115/365) = ?

115/365 = 0.31507.

0.31507 * 173.50 = let's compute:

173.50 *0.3 =52.05

173.50 *0.01507= ?

0.01 *173.50=1.735

0.00507 *173.50= approx 0.880.

So total for 0.01507 is 1.735 +0.880=2.615.

So total is 52.05 +2.615=54.665, so $54.665, which rounds to $54.67.

So the refund is 173.50 -54.67= $118.83, which is approximately $118.84.

So the refund should be $118.84 in both cases, but the options don't have that. Only option D has $118.84 for (b).

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the scenarios. Maybe when the policy is canceled by the policyholder, the refund is the amount paid minus the used portion, which is $54.66, so the refund is $54.66. But that's not matching any options. Alternatively, perhaps the refund is the amount paid minus the used portion, so the refund is $54.66, but that would mean the amount kept is $118.84, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, no, the refund is the amount not yet earned by the company. So if the policy was in effect for 115 days, the company has earned 115/365 of the premium, so the refund is the remaining, which is 250/365 *173.50= $118.84.

So for (a), if he cancels, the refund is $118.84. For (b), if the company cancels, perhaps they don't prorate and give the full premium, but that can't be right because the policy was active. So I'm confused.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D is (a) $100.63 and (b) $118.84. So (a) is $100.63, which is less than $118.84. How could that be?

Wait, perhaps when the policyholder cancels, they are charged a fee, so the refund is less. For example, if there's a $17 cancellation fee, then 173.50 -54.66 -17=101.84, which is close to $100.63. But I don't know if there's a fee mentioned.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done using a 360-day year for the policyholder's case. Let me try that.

If using 360 days for (a), 115/360=0.3194. 0.3194 *173.50≈55.56. So refund is 173.50 -55.56≈117.94, which is close to $118.84 but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the company uses different methods. Maybe in (a), the policyholder cancels, and the company uses a different proration method, like monthly, which could give a different result.

Wait, maybe the company calculates refunds based on the exact days, so for (a), the refund is $118.84, and for (b), perhaps the company uses a different method, like giving back the amount for the days remaining, but that doesn't quite make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the options again. Option C is $72.87 and $54.66. Wait, $72.87 is (173.50 * 0.422). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the company cancels and gives a different proration.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the refund is calculated as the average monthly cost times the remaining months. So 115 days is 3 months and 25 days. The remaining months would be 9 months and 5 days, which is approximately 9 months. So 9 * (173.50/12)=9*14.4583≈130.125. So the refund would be $130.13, which isn't matching any options.

Alternatively, maybe the company uses a daily rate. So daily rate is 173.50 /365≈0.4753 per day. So for 115 days, the amount earned is 115 *0.4753≈54.66, so the refund is 173.50 -54.66≈118.84.

So regardless of who cancels, the refund should be the same, $118.84. But the options don't have that. Option D has (b) as $118.84, and (a) as $100.63.

Wait, perhaps when the policyholder cancels, they have to pay a fee, so the refund is less. For example, if there's a $17 fee, 118.84 -17=101.84, which is close to $100.63. But I don't know if the question implies any fees.

Alternatively, perhaps the company doesn't prorate when they cancel and gives a full refund, but that can't be right because the policy was active.

Wait, maybe the company's cancellation doesn't prorate, so they give back the full premium minus the prorated part. But that's the same as the policyholder's case.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me look at the options again. Option C is $72.87 and $54.66. $54.66 is the amount used, so the refund would be 173.50 -54.66=118.84, which is option D's (b). So perhaps (a) is $118.84 and (b) is $54.66, but that's not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the way the refund is calculated is different. Maybe when the policy is canceled by the policyholder, they get the amount for the days used, and when the company cancels, they get the amount for the remaining days. That would be the opposite.

So for (a), the policyholder cancels, so they get the amount for the 115 days, which is $54.66, and for (b), the company cancels, so they get the remaining 250 days, which is $118.84. But the options don't have that. The options have (a) first and (b) second.

Looking at the options, option C is $72.87 and $54.66. Option D is $100.63 and $118.84.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me think differently. Maybe the refund is calculated as the amount per day multiplied by the days remaining.

So total days:365. Days used:115. Days remaining:250.

Daily rate:173.50 /365≈0.4753 per day.

Refund for days remaining:250 *0.4753≈118.83≈$118.84.

So for (b), if the company cancels, the refund is $118.84. For (a), if the policyholder cancels, perhaps the refund is the amount for days used, which is 115 *0.4753≈54.66. But that would mean (a) is $54.66, which is option C's (b), but the options don't match.

Alternatively, perhaps when the policyholder cancels, they get the amount for the days they used, so $54.66, and when the company cancels, they get the amount for the days remaining, $118.84. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the way the refund is calculated is that when the policyholder cancels, they are refunded for the days remaining, and when the company cancels, they are refunded for the days used. That would make (a) $118.84 and (b) $54.66, but none of the options have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the company's cancellation gives a different proration. Maybe the company uses a different method, like monthly proration without partial months.

So 115 days is 3 full months (30 days each) and 25 days. So 3 months:3*(173.50/12)=43.375. 25 days:25/30*(173.50/12)=25/30 *14.4583≈11.714. So total paid:43.375 +11.714≈55.089. Refund:173.50 -55.089≈118.41, which is close to $118.84.

But again, the options don't have $118.41 for (a).

Wait, perhaps the question is about the amount paid, not the refund. But the question says "how much was his refund".

I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again. Option D is (a)$100.63 and (b)$118.84. So perhaps (a) is when he cancels, and (b) when the company cancels.

Wait, maybe when he cancels, the refund is calculated as (365-115)/365 * premium, which is 250/365 *173.50=118.84. So (a) is 118.84, but option D has (a) as 100.63. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps when he cancels, the company keeps a portion as a fee, so the refund is less. For example, 118.84 -17≈101.84, which is close to option D's (a) of 100.63.

Alternatively, maybe the calculation is done using 360 days for (a) and 365 for (b). Let me try that.

For (a), using 360 days:115/360=0.3194. 0.3194*173.50≈55.56. So refund is 173.50 -55.56≈117.94, which is not matching.

Alternatively, maybe (a) is calculated as 115 days at a monthly rate. So 115 days is 3 months and 25 days. So 3 months:3*(173.50/12)=43.375. 25 days:25/30*14.4583≈11.714. Total used:55.089. Refund:173.50-55.089≈118.41, which is close to $118.84.

But again, this doesn't explain why (a) is $100.63.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me compute 173.50 * (115/365) exactly.

115 ÷365 = 0.31507 approximately.

0.31507 *173.50 = ?

Let me compute 173.50 *0.3 =52.05

173.50 *0.01507 =173.50 *0.01=1.735; 173.50 *0.00507= approx 0.880.

So total is 1.735 +0.880=2.615.

So total is 52.05 +2.615=54.665, which is $54.665, so $54.67.

So the refund is 173.50 -54.67= $118.83, which is $118.83, approximately $118.84.

So for (a), when he cancels, the refund is $118.84, and for (b), when the company cancels, perhaps the refund is different.

Wait, but the options don't have that. The only option with $118.84 is option D for (b). So perhaps (a) is $100.63, which is 173.50 -72.87=100.63. Wait, 72.87 is 173.50 *0.42, which is (365-115)/365=250/365=0.6849, which is not 0.42. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the refund is calculated as the average monthly cost times the remaining months. So 115 days is 3 months and 25 days, so remaining months are 9 months and 5 days, approximately 9 months.

So 9 months:9*(173.50/12)=9*14.4583≈130.125. So refund is $130.13, which isn't matching any options.

I'm stuck. Let me think differently. Maybe the question is about the amount he paid, not the refund. But the question clearly says "how much was his refund".

Wait, perhaps the company has a different proration method. Maybe they prorate based on the exact days, but for the policyholder's cancellation, they subtract a fee. For example, if the refund is $118.84, but they charge a $17 fee, so he gets $101.84, which is close to $100.63 in option D.

But the question doesn't mention any fees, so I think the answer should be that both refunds are $118.84, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is D: $100.63 and $118.84.

Wait, but how is $100.63 calculated? Let me see: 173.50 * (115/365)=54.66. So 173.50 -54.66=118.84.

Alternatively, maybe the company's calculation is based on 360 days, so for (a), 115/360=0.3194, 0.3194*173.50≈55.56. So refund is 173.50 -55.56≈117.94, which is close to $118.84.

But again, that doesn't explain $100.63.

Wait, perhaps the refund is calculated as the daily rate times the days remaining. So 250 days * (173.50/365)=250 *0.4753≈118.84.

So for (a), if he cancels, the refund is $118.84, and for (b), if the company cancels, perhaps the refund is based on the days used, which is $54.66. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the company's cancellation gives a different calculation, like giving back the full premium minus a pro rata part. But that's the same as the policyholder's case.

I'm really stuck here. Given the options, and my calculations, the refund should be $118.84 in both cases, but that's not an option. The only option with $118.84 is D for (b). So perhaps (a) is $100.63, which I can't figure out, but I'll go with option D as the answer.

The problem involves calculating the refund for Mr. Wingate's automobile insurance policy, which was canceled 115 days after it went into effect. The annual premium is $173.50, and the task is to determine the refund amount for two scenarios: (a) when Mr. Wingate cancels the policy and (b) when the insurance company cancels the policy.

### Key Steps:
1. **Annual Premium**: $173.50.
2. **Policy Duration**: 115 days.
3. **Fraction of the Year**:  
   \[
   \frac{115}{365} \approx 0.31507
   \]
4. **Amount Used**:  
   \[
   0.31507 \times 173.50 \approx 54.66
   \]
5. **Refund Calculation**:  
   The refund is the remaining portion of the premium, calculated as:  
   \[
   173.50 - 54.66 \approx 118.84
   \]

### Analysis of Scenarios:
- **(a) Mr. Wingate Cancels**: The refund is based on the prorated amount for the 115 days, which is $118.84.
- **(b) Insurance Company Cancels**: The refund calculation remains the same as above, resulting in $118.84.

However, the options provided suggest that the refund amounts differ between the two scenarios. After considering potential fees or alternative proration methods, the most plausible answer aligns with **Option D**, where the refund for (a) is $100.63 and for (b) is $118.84.

ANSWER: D
