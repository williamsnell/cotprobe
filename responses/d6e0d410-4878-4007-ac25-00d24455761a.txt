Okay, so I've got this question about the lac operon in E. coli. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The question says that the glucose level is low, and there's a mutation in the repressor that prevents it from binding to lactose. I need to figure out what effect that has on the expression of the lac operon genes.

Wait, I remember that the lac operon is responsible for the metabolism of lactose in E. coli. The operon consists of several genes that code for proteins needed to take in lactose and break it down. The operon's regulation is controlled by a repressor protein. Normally, when lactose isn't present, the repressor binds to the operator region of the operon, preventing transcription. But when lactose is present, it binds to the repressor, causing it to change shape and release from the operator, allowing transcription to occur.

So, in this scenario, the repressor can't bind to lactose because of the mutation. That means the repressor is always active, right? Because without lactose binding, the repressor stays attached to the operator. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If the repressor can't bind lactose, then lactose can't inactivate it. So normally, when lactose is present, the repressor is inactive (because lactose binds to it), so the operon is expressed. If the repressor can't bind lactose, then it can't be inactivated. So the repressor would always be active, meaning it would be stuck binding to the operator, preventing transcription. Oh wait, but wait—no, because if the repressor can't bind lactose, then lactose can't cause the repressor to release from the operator.

Wait, no, that's the opposite. Let's think again. The repressor's function is to bind the operator and prevent transcription when lactose isn't present. When lactose is present, it binds to the repressor, causing it to release from the operator, allowing the genes to be expressed.

If the mutation prevents the repressor from binding lactose, then lactose can't bind to the repressor. So the repressor can't be inactivated. That means the repressor remains bound to the operator regardless of lactose presence. So the operon would be repressed whether lactose is present or not.

Wait, but wait, the question states that glucose is low. Because E. coli prefers glucose over lactose, and when glucose is present, even if lactose is available, the operon isn't highly active. But in this case, glucose is low, so maybe the cells would use lactose if available.

Wait, but in the mutation scenario, the repressor can't bind lactose. So the operon would be off unless the repressor is inactive. But without lactose binding, the repressor is active and binds the operator. So the operon is repressed, regardless of lactose presence.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me go through it step by step.

1. Normally, lac operon has a repressor. When lactose is absent, repressor binds operator, operon is off. When lactose is present, it binds repressor, which changes shape and releases from operator, so operon is on.

2. Mutation in repressor prevents binding to lactose. So lactose can't bind to repressor. So the repressor can't be inactivated. So the repressor remains active, meaning it stays bound to the operator.

3. If repressor is always bound (because it can't be inactivated by lactose), the operon is always off, right? So the genes aren't expressed regardless of lactose presence.

But wait, the question says the glucose level is low. Oh, right, because in the presence of glucose, even if lactose is available, the operon isn't active because E. coli prefers glucose. But when glucose is low, lactose becomes a better option.

Wait, but in this mutation, the operon is always off because the repressor is always on the operator. So regardless of lactose, the operon is repressed. So even if lactose is present, the operon isn't expressed because the repressor is stuck on.

So looking at the options:

A: expression only when glucose is present — but glucose is low, so not sure.

B: lack of expression under all circumstances — yes, that's what I was thinking. Because the repressor is always bound.

C: no change — no, because the mutation should affect it.

D: expression only when lactose is absent — that can't be right because without lactose, the repressor is usually on, but in this case, the repressor is always on.

E: constitutive expression (always on) — no, because the repressor is always on, so the operon is off.

F: expression only when lactose is present — no, because the repressor can't be inactivated, so the operon can't be turned on.

G: increased expression under all — no.

H: expression only when glucose is absent — but glucose is low, but the operon is still off.

I: constitutive repression — meaning always repressed, which matches what I thought.

Wait, so the options are B and I. Let me check the options again.

Option B: lack of expression or reduced expression under all circumstances.

Option I: constitutive repression of the lac operon genes.

Constitutive repression means the genes are always repressed. So that's the case here. So the correct answer would be I.

Wait, but wait. Another angle: the lac operon also has a positive regulation via CAP (catabolite activator protein) when glucose is low. So when glucose is low, cAMP levels are high, CAP binds, and enhances transcription.

But in this case, if the repressor is always bound to the operator, even with CAP, the operon can't be transcribed. Because the operator region is blocked. So even if CAP is bound, the RNA polymerase can't proceed because the operator is occupied by the repressor.

So yes, the operon would be repressed all the time, regardless of lactose and CAP.

So the mutation causes the repressor to always bind, leading to constitutive repression, meaning the genes are never expressed.

So the correct answer is I: constitutive repression of the lac operon genes.

The lac operon in *E. coli* is regulated by a repressor protein that binds to the operator to prevent transcription when lactose is absent. When lactose is present, it binds to the repressor, causing it to release from the operator, allowing transcription to occur. In this scenario, a mutation in the repressor prevents it from binding lactose. As a result, the repressor cannot be inactivated by lactose and remains bound to the operator under all conditions, repressing the operon regardless of lactose presence.

Even though glucose is low, which typically allows for the activation of the operon via CAP (catabolite activator protein), the repressor's constant presence on the operator blocks transcription. This leads to constitutive repression of the lac operon genes, meaning they are never expressed.

The correct answer is:

**I: constitutive repression of the lac operon genes**

Answer: I
