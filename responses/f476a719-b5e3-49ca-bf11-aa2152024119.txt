Question:

Milgram (1965) found that participants in his study were more willing to administer electric shocks to another person when they couldn't see the victim and the victim couldn't see them. This ﬁnding is predicted by Zimbardo’s notion of:

Options:

A: bystander effect.
B: conformity.
C: psychological reactance.
D: self-perception.
E: self-verification.
F: groupthink.
G: deindividuation.
H: social facilitation.
I: cognitive dissonance.
J: pluralistic ignorance.

Okay, so I need to figure out which of these options corresponds to Zimbardo's notion that explains Milgram's 1965 findings. Let me start by recalling what I know about Milgram's study. Milgram conducted experiments where participants were instructed to administer electric shocks to another person, who was actually an actor. He found that people were more likely to follow instructions to shock someone when they couldn't see the victim and the victim couldn't see them. So the key here is the effect of anonymity or not seeing the victim on the willingness to cause harm.

Now, looking at Zimbardo's concepts, I remember that he did the Stanford Prison Experiment, which highlighted issues like deindividuation and loss of personal identity in groups. Deindividuation refers to the phenomenon where individuals lose their sense of self and personal identity when part of a group, which can lead to increased conformity and willingness to engage in behaviors they wouldn't otherwise.

In Milgram's study, when participants couldn't see the victim, they might have felt less personal responsibility, making it easier to follow the experimenter's orders. This aligns with deindividuation because the physical separation could have made the victim less of a person in their eyes, reducing empathy and increasing obedience.

Let me go through the options one by one to be sure. 

A: Bystander effect is about how people are less likely to help when others are present. That doesn't fit here because the issue is about not seeing the victim, not the presence of others.

B: Conformity is about changing behavior to fit in with a group, but Milgram's study wasn't exactly about conforming to group norms but rather about the conditions under which people obey authority, even if it causes harm.

C: Psychological reactance is about resistance to coercion, but Milgram's participants were more willing to shock, so reactance doesn't explain that.

D: Self-perception and E: Self-verification are about how people view themselves, which doesn't directly relate to the situation where the victim is unseen.

F: Groupthink is about making decisions that are over-consistent with the group, but again, Milgram's study was more about individual obedience than group decision-making.

G: Deindividuation seems to fit because when the victim isn't visible, the participant might feel less connected, leading to increased willingness to harm—exactly what Zimbardo's theory would predict.

H: Social facilitation is about how the presence of others affects performance, which isn't directly related here.

I: Cognitive dissonance is about conflicting thoughts, but Milgram's participants didn't necessarily show signs of that; instead, they conformed to the experiment's instructions.

J: Pluralistic ignorance is when individuals think others know more, but that's not the case here.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be G: deindividuation.

The correct answer is G: deindividuation. Milgram's findings align with Zimbardo's concept of deindividuation, where the lack of personal connection to the victim reduces empathy and increases willingness to obey authority.

Answer: G
