Question:

A man was under custodial interrogation as a suspect in the murder of a child. The police initially gave him a written list of his Miranda rights. They told him to read the list out loud, which he did. They then asked him if he understood the right to remain silent and to have a lawyer present and he nodded affirmatively. He refused to sign the writing but did not ask for an attorney. During the next three hours they interrogated him and got few answers; he was largely silent but did respond at times with a "no" or "yes" or a nod of the head. Then one of the detectives asked him if he was ready to ask God for forgiveness for killing the child. His eyes welled with tears and he said "yes." This opened further questioning leading to his admission of guilt. He would not sign a written confession or a waiver of the right to remain silent. He was arrested for murder and moved to suppress the confession. Will the court suppress the confession as being involuntarily given?

Options:

A: No, the suspect's emotional response and admission of guilt indicates a voluntary confession.
B: Yes, the confession is considered involuntary because he did not sign a written waiver of his right to remain silent.
C: Yes, the suspect's refusal to sign the written confession and waiver of rights indicates the confession was involuntary.
D: No, the suspect's engagement in the questioning, although minimal, demonstrates an understanding and voluntary waiver of his rights.
E: No, the confession is not considered involuntary as the suspect voluntarily answered the questions without the presence of an attorney.
F: Yes, the confession must be suppressed because the suspect was largely silent during the interrogation, indicating a lack of willingness to participate.
G: Yes, the use of religious deception to get a suspect to admit to crime renders the confession involuntary.
H: No, the circumstances indicate that he understood that he could stop the questioning and get a lawyer but he did not do so.
I: Yes, the confession must be suppressed because he was questioned for over three hours, making anything he said essentially involuntary.
J: No, whenever a written list of Miranda warnings is given to a suspect and he doesn't ask for a lawyer, this is proof that the suspect fully understands his rights.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the court will suppress the confession as being involuntarily given. Let me break down the situation step by step.

First, the man was under custodial interrogation for the murder of a child. The police gave him a written list of his Miranda rights. He read them out loud, and then they asked if he understood the right to remain silent and to have a lawyer present. He nodded yes. However, he didn't sign the written Miranda rights, and he didn't ask for an attorney. 

Over the next three hours, they interrogated him, and he was mostly silent but occasionally answered with yes, no, or nods. Then a detective asked him if he was ready to ask God for forgiveness for killing the child. He got emotional, tears welled up, and he said "yes." This led to his admission of guilt. He didn't sign a written confession or a waiver of his right to remain silent.

Now, he's being arrested for murder and wants to suppress the confession, claiming it was involuntary.

I remember that Miranda rights require that the suspect both understands and waives their rights. The key here is whether the waiver was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. 

In this case, the suspect did read the Miranda rights, nodded when asked if he understood, but didn't sign. However, the Supreme Court has held that a suspect's Miranda waiver doesn't have to be in writing. The important thing is whether the suspect understood and voluntarily waived the rights. So the lack of a signed waiver doesn't automatically make the confession inadmissible.

He did nod when asked about understanding his rights, which could indicate he understood. But he didn't ask for a lawyer, even though he had the right to do so. During the questioning, he was mostly silent but did answer occasionally, so he wasn't completely unresponsive. 

The critical point is when the detective used a religious appeal. The question is whether this constitutes coercion that would make the confession involuntary. Using religious language to manipulate a suspect might be problematic, but it's not always considered coercion. The court would look at whether the suspect was under duress or whether the method used overcame his free will. 

The suspect's emotional response and saying "yes" could be seen as voluntary, especially if he had previously indicated understanding of his rights and didn't explicitly ask for a lawyer. His minimal engagement during questioning suggests he wasn't completely resistant but didn't fully participate either. 

Looking at the options:

A: Says the confession is voluntary because of his emotional response. This seems possible because he did nod and respond, but I'm not sure if the religious question affects this.

B: Claims the confession is involuntary because he didn't sign a waiver. But Miranda doesn't require a signed waiver, so this might not hold.

C: Argues the refusal to sign indicates an involuntary confession. Again, the lack of a signature isn't the key factor here.

D: Suggests his minimal engagement shows a voluntary waiver. This could be a good point because he did answer some questions.

E: Says he voluntarily answered without a lawyer, so it's not involuntary. But Miranda rights require that you can't be questioned without an attorney present unless you waive it. Since he didn't ask for a lawyer, maybe it's okay.

F: Argues the long questioning and his silence make it involuntary. But the law doesn't necessarily suppress confessions just because of the time unless it's coercive.

G: Suggests religious deception makes it involuntary. This is tricky. Courts have been inconsistent on whether religious appeals count as coercion. Some cases say it's permissible if not overtly coercive.

H: Says he understood he could stop or get a lawyer but didn't, so no suppression. This aligns with the idea that if he knew his rights and didn't exercise them, the confession is voluntary.

I: Argues over three hours made it involuntary. Again, time alone doesn't make it involuntary unless there's coercion.

J: Claims the written Miranda is enough if he didn't ask for a lawyer. But Miranda requires more than just being given the rights; the suspect must actually waive them. However, the fact that he didn't ask for a lawyer might suggest he waived the right to have one present.

So, considering all this, the key factors are whether he understood his rights and whether the confession was voluntary. The fact that he didn't sign a waiver isn't determinative. The religious question might not be considered coercive, especially if it's not seen as overbearing. His nodding and minimal responses suggest he was participating, even if not actively.

Option A says the emotional response and admission indicate a voluntary confession. That seems plausible because he responded affirmatively when directly asked. 

Option D says his minimal engagement shows a voluntary waiver. That also has merit because he was responding, albeit minimally.

Option G is about religious deception. I'm not sure if that's enough to render it involuntary. The law generally allows for religious appeals unless it's deemed unduly coercive. Without more details, it's hard to say, but I think the courts might not consider this as coercion here.

Option H suggests he understood he could stop or get a lawyer and didn't, so it's voluntary. That's a strong point because he had the option to stop the questioning or get a lawyer and chose not to.

Option J is incorrect because simply being given Miranda rights in writing doesn't automatically prove he waived them. He had to understand and waive them, which he did by nodding.

So between A, D, and H. The correct test is whether the waiver was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. The suspect nodded when asked if he understood, which suggests he knew his rights. He didn't ask for a lawyer, indicating he waived the right to have one present. His minimal engagement during questioning suggests he wasn't coerced but was participating, albeit reluctantly.

The fact that the detective used a religious appeal might not be enough to make the confession involuntary unless it's seen as coercive. But in this case, the suspect was already nodding and answering, so the detective's question likely didn't force him into confessing against his will.

Therefore, the confession was voluntary because he understood his rights, didn't ask for a lawyer, and responded to questions. So the court would likely not suppress the confession.

Looking at the options again, option A says the emotional response and admission indicate a voluntary confession. Option D says his engagement, though minimal, shows understanding and a voluntary waiver. Option H says he didn't exercise his right to stop or get a lawyer, so it's voluntary.

I think the best answer is A or D, but considering the Miranda requirements, D seems more accurate because his minimal engagement and nodding affirmatively indicate he understood and waived his rights.

The court will not suppress the confession because the suspect demonstrated understanding of his Miranda rights by nodding affirmatively when asked and minimally engaging during questioning. His emotional response and admission, though significant, do not negate the voluntary nature of the waiver. The lack of a signed waiver is not determinative, as Miranda rights can be waived orally or through actions. The use of a religious appeal, while notable, does not rise to the level of coercion required to render the confession involuntary. Therefore, the confession is considered voluntary.

Answer: D
