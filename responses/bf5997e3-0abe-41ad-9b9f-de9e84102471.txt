Okay, so I've got this problem about an oxygen cylinder and adding nitrogen to it. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on gas laws, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem states that the oxygen cylinder is at 35 psia and 80°F, and it contains 0.9 lb of oxygen. Then, nitrogen is added to increase the pressure to 45 psia at the same temperature. I need to find the mass of nitrogen added.

First, I remember that when dealing with gases, the ideal gas law might come into play here. The ideal gas law is PV = nRT. But wait, since both the oxygen and nitrogen are at the same temperature and volume, maybe I can use the concept of partial pressures here. Oh right, Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures states that the total pressure of a gas mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of each component.

So, the initial pressure is just oxygen at 35 psia. After adding nitrogen, the total pressure becomes 45 psia. That means the partial pressure of nitrogen would be 45 psia minus the partial pressure of oxygen, which is 35 psia. So, the pressure of nitrogen added would be 45 - 35 = 10 psia.

Now, since both gases are at the same temperature, their moles should be proportional to their pressures if the volume is constant. Because the ideal gas equation per mole is P1/n1 = P2/n2 when T and V are constant. Wait, no, more accurately, for the same V and T, P is proportional to n (moles). So, the number of moles of oxygen and nitrogen can be related to their pressures.

Let me think. The number of moles of oxygen initially is n_O2. The pressure from O2 is 35 psia. So, n_O2 = (P_O2 * V) / (R*T). Similarly, when we add nitrogen, the pressure from N2 is 10 psia, so n_N2 = (P_N2 * V) / (R*T). 

But wait, the volume V and temperature T are the same for both. So, the ratio of moles would be n_N2 / n_O2 = P_N2 / P_O2. So, n_N2 = n_O2 * (P_N2 / P_O2).

But I need to find the mass of nitrogen added, not the number of moles. So, I'll first find the number of moles of oxygen, then find the moles of nitrogen based on the pressure ratio, and then convert that to mass.

First, let's calculate the number of moles of oxygen. The mass of O2 is 0.9 lb. The molecular weight of O2 is 32 g/mol, which is 0.032 kg/mol or 32 lb per 453.592 moles (since 1 kg ≈ 2.20462 lb). Wait, maybe it's better to use consistent units. Let me think.

Wait, maybe I should use the specific volume or the ideal gas equation in terms of lb and psia. Alternatively, use the ideal gas law with appropriate units.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me structure this:

1. Find the number of moles of O2 initially.
2. Use the pressure ratio to find the number of moles of N2 added.
3. Convert moles of N2 to mass.

So, step 1: n_O2 = mass_O2 / molecular_weight_O2.

Mass of O2 is 0.9 lb. Molecular weight of O2 is 32 lb per mole? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the molecular weight of O2 is 32 g/mol, so 32 grams per mole. Since 1 lb is approximately 453.592 grams, 32 g is about 0.0707 lb per mole. So, molecular weight of O2 is 32 g/mol ≈ 0.0707 lb/mol.

Wait, but let me check: 1 lb ≈ 453.592 grams, so 32 grams is 32/453.592 ≈ 0.070548 lb per mole. So, yes, molecular weight of O2 is approximately 0.070548 lb/mol.

So, n_O2 = 0.9 lb / 0.070548 lb/mol ≈ let me calculate that. 0.9 divided by 0.070548 is approximately 12.76 mol.

Wait, let me do the division: 0.070548 * 12 = 0.846576, 0.070548 * 12.76 ≈ 0.9. So yeah, about 12.76 moles of O2.

Now, for the nitrogen added, the partial pressure is 10 psia. Since the oxygen's partial pressure is 35 psia, and the total is 45. So, the nitrogen contributes 10 psia.

Assuming ideal gas behavior and same volume and temperature, the number of moles of N2 added (n_N2) can be found by the ratio of their pressures. So, n_N2 = n_O2 * (P_N2 / P_O2) = 12.76 * (10 / 35) ≈ 12.76 * 0.2857 ≈ 3.63 moles.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that. Because the pressure of N2 is 10 psia, and O2's pressure is 35 psia, but both are at the same V and T, so their moles are proportional to their pressures.

So, n_N2 = (P_N2 / P_O2) * n_O2 = (10 / 35) * 12.76 ≈ (0.2857) * 12.76 ≈ 3.63 moles.

Now, the molecular weight of N2 is 28 g/mol, which is 0.06222 lb/mol (since 28g is 0.06222 lb because 28/453.592 ≈ 0.0618 lb). Wait, let me calculate that accurately: 28 grams is 28 / 453.592 ≈ 0.061776 lb per mole.

So, the mass of N2 added is n_N2 * molecular_weight_N2 = 3.63 * 0.061776 ≈ let's compute that.

3.63 * 0.061776 ≈ 0.224 lb.

Wait, that's approximately 0.224 lb. Looking at the options, option B is 0.225 lb, which is very close. So, the mass of nitrogen added is approximately 0.225 lb, which would be option B.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, n_O2 = 0.9 lb / (32 g/mol) converted to lb. 32 g = 0.0707 lb/mol. 0.9 / 0.0707 ≈ 12.73 moles.

Then, n_N2 = (10/35) * 12.73 ≈ (0.2857) * 12.73 ≈ 3.63 moles.

Molecular weight of N2 is 28 g/mol = 0.061776 lb/mol.

Mass N2 = 3.63 * 0.061776 ≈ 0.224 lb, which rounds to 0.225 lb. So option B is correct.

The problem involves determining the mass of nitrogen added to an oxygen cylinder to increase its pressure from 35 psia to 45 psia at the same temperature. Using Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures and the ideal gas law, the partial pressure of nitrogen added is calculated as 10 psia. The number of moles of oxygen is found using its mass and molecular weight, and the number of moles of nitrogen is determined by the ratio of their pressures. Converting the moles of nitrogen to mass gives approximately 0.225 lb, corresponding to option B.
