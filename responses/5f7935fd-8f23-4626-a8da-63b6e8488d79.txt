Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an artificial satellite and a meteor collision. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

Alright, the satellite is orbiting Earth just above the atmosphere in a circular path with a constant speed. That makes sense because, in a circular orbit, the centripetal force is provided by gravity. Now, a small meteor collides with the satellite at point P, increasing its speed by 1%. Importantly, the direction of the velocity isn't changed at the moment of collision. Hmm, so the speed goes up by 1%, but the direction remains the same as it was right before the collision.

Wait, so before the collision, the satellite was moving in a circle. Its velocity is tangential to the circle at point P. After the collision, its speed increases, but the direction is the same. That means the satellite's velocity vector at point P has a slightly higher magnitude but the same direction. 

I remember that in orbital mechanics, when a satellite's speed increases in a circular orbit, it will no longer maintain that orbit. The increased speed will cause it to move into a new orbit. But what kind of orbit? Let me think.

In a circular orbit, all points have the same speed. If the speed increases, the satellite will move to a higher orbit. But wait, no, actually, wait. I might be getting this mixed up. Let me recall: for a circular orbit, the required speed is the orbital velocity. If you increase the speed beyond that, you actually go into an elliptical orbit where the point of collision becomes the closest point to Earth, right? Because when you add speed in the direction of motion, you're giving it more kinetic energy, which makes it move further away.

Wait, but wait again. The satellite was in a circular orbit. At point P, it's moving with velocity v. After the collision, its speed becomes v' = 1.01v. But since the direction of velocity is unchanged, the new velocity is still tangential at point P. So now, the satellite's velocity is higher, meaning it has more kinetic energy. So what happens? 

In circular motion, the centripetal force is provided by gravity. The formula for orbital velocity is v = sqrt(GM/r), where G is the gravitational constant, M is Earth's mass, and r is the radius. If the velocity increases, according to this formula, the radius would have to decrease. Because if v is higher, the radius r must be smaller for the same gravitational pull. Wait, wait, no. Let me check that again. The formula is v = sqrt(GM/r), so if v increases, r must decrease because as denominator gets smaller, the value increases. So if the speed increases, the required centripetal force (mv²/r) increases. But gravity provides the centripetal force, so the new orbit must have a smaller radius? But that's only if the satellite remains in a circular orbit. However, after the collision, it's not in a circular orbit anymore because the velocity is higher but direction is same.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says the satellite was moving in a circle and the meteor increases its speed by 1% without changing the direction. So the velocity vector's magnitude increases, but direction remains tangential at P. So now, the satellite has a velocity that's higher than the circular velocity at that point. So, what does that do? I think it would cause the satellite's orbit to change from a circle to an ellipse, with point P being the closest point to Earth, because the increased speed would carry it to a higher orbit point opposite to P.

Wait, no, wait. Let's think about it: when you are in a circular orbit and you increase your speed, you end up with an elliptical orbit where the point of maximum speed is the point where you got the speed boost. Because when you add speed in the direction of motion, you give it more kinetic energy, which translates into a higher orbit. So in this case, after P, the satellite's velocity is higher, so it will move to a new orbit where P is the perigee (the closest point to Earth). Because the velocity at P is higher than the original circular velocity, so it will swing outwards, making an ellipse with P as the perigee.

So looking at the options, option G says the satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with P as the closest approach to Earth. That sounds right. Option E is similar but says P is the midpoint of the minor axis, which doesn't fit because the perigee is the closest point.

Wait, another thought: when you add speed, does it make the orbit larger or smaller? Well, adding speed would require a higher orbit because you have more kinetic energy. So the satellite would move into an elliptical orbit where P is the point of closest approach, and the farthest point would be on the opposite side.

Wait, but the initial orbit is a circle. After increasing speed, the new orbit's semi-major axis would be larger, so the ellipse would have P as the perigee, and the apogee would be farther away.

So the correct answer should be G: an ellipse with P as the closest approach.

The satellite initially orbits Earth in a circular path. When the meteor strikes, it increases the satellite's speed by 1% without altering its direction. This increase in speed adds kinetic energy to the satellite, causing it to move into a new orbit. Since the speed at point P is now higher than the original circular orbital velocity, the satellite's orbit changes from a circle to an ellipse. In this new elliptical orbit, point P becomes the closest approach to Earth (perigee), as the satellite swings outward to a farther point (apogee) on the opposite side.

Option G correctly describes this scenario, as the satellite now orbits in an ellipse with P as the closest approach to Earth.
