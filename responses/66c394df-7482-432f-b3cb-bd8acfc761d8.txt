Okay, so I have this calculus problem here. Let me see if I can figure it out. The function is h(x) = 1/(√x + 1), and I need to find the second derivative at x=1. Hmm, derivatives can be tricky, especially second ones, but let's take it step by step.

First, maybe I should rewrite the function to make it easier to differentiate. The function is h(x) = 1/(√x + 1), which is the same as h(x) = (√x + 1)^(-1). That might be easier to work with when applying the chain rule.

So, to find h''(x), I need to first find the first derivative h'(x), and then differentiate that to get h''(x). Let me start with the first derivative.

Using the chain rule: if h(x) = u^(-1), where u = √x + 1, then h'(x) = -u^(-2) * u'. 

Wait, what's u' here? u is √x + 1, so the derivative of u with respect to x is (1/(2√x)) + 0, since the derivative of 1 is zero. So u' = 1/(2√x).

Putting that back into h'(x), we get h'(x) = - (√x + 1)^(-2) * (1/(2√x)).

Simplify that: h'(x) = -1/(2√x (√x + 1)^2). Okay, that's the first derivative.

Now I need the second derivative, h''(x). To find that, I'll have to differentiate h'(x). Let me write h'(x) as:

h'(x) = - (1) / [2√x (√x + 1)^2]

Hmm, this looks like a quotient, but maybe it's easier to use the product rule. Let me think of the denominator as two functions multiplied together: 2√x and (√x +1)^2.

Wait, actually, h'(x) is negative times 1 divided by [2√x (√x +1)^2]. So maybe I can write h'(x) as -1/(2√x (√x +1)^2) and then apply the chain rule or quotient rule.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to write h'(x) as a product of terms and use the product rule. Let me see.

Let me denote f(x) = 2√x and g(x) = (√x +1)^2. So h'(x) is -1/(f(x) g(x)), which can be written as - [f(x) g(x)]^(-1). 

Alternatively, maybe it's better to use the quotient rule. The quotient rule states that d/dx (u/v) = (v u' - u v') / v^2. But since h'(x) is -1/(f g), let me set u = 1 and v = 2√x (√x +1)^2. Then, h'(x) = -u/v, so the derivative would be - (v*u' - u*v') / v^2. But u' is zero, so it's - (-u v') / v^2, which simplifies to u v' / v^2. But wait, that's getting complicated. Maybe I should find the derivative directly.

Let me try writing h'(x) as - (2√x (√x +1)^2)^(-1). Then, to find h''(x), I can use the chain rule. Let’s set u = 2√x (√x +1)^2. Then h'(x) = -u^(-1), so h''(x) would be the derivative of that.

The derivative of -u^(-1) with respect to x is (1) * u^(-2) * u', so h''(x) = u' / u^2.

So now I need to find u' where u = 2√x (√x +1)^2. This is a product of three terms: 2, √x, and (√x +1)^2. Wait, no, actually, u is 2√x multiplied by (√x +1)^2. So to find u', I'll use the product rule: u = f(x) * g(x), where f(x) = 2√x and g(x) = (√x +1)^2.

So, u' = f'(x) * g(x) + f(x) * g'(x).

Let me compute f'(x): f(x) = 2√x = 2 x^(1/2), so f'(x) = 2*(1/2) x^(-1/2) = 1/√x.

Now g(x) = (√x +1)^2. Let's find g'(x). Using the chain rule: let’s set w = √x +1, so g(x) = w^2. Then g'(x) = 2w * w'. w = √x +1, so w' = 1/(2√x).

Thus, g'(x) = 2 (√x +1) * (1/(2√x)) ) = (√x +1) / √x.

So putting it all together, u' = f'(x) g(x) + f(x) g'(x) = [1/√x] * (√x +1)^2 + [2√x] * [ (√x +1) / √x ].

Simplify each term.

First term: [1/√x] * (√x +1)^2 = (√x +1)^2 / √x.

Second term: [2√x] * [ (√x +1) / √x ] = 2√x * (√x +1) / √x. The √x in the numerator and denominator cancel out, so this becomes 2(√x +1).

Now, let's compute u' as the sum of these two terms:

u' = (√x +1)^2 / √x + 2(√x +1).

Hmm, maybe I can factor out (√x +1) from both terms.

Let me factor out (√x +1):

u' = (√x +1) [ (√x +1)/√x + 2 ].

Let me compute what's inside the brackets:

(√x +1)/√x + 2 = (√x/√x + 1/√x) + 2 = (1 + 1/√x) + 2 = 3 + 1/√x.

So, u' = (√x +1) (3 + 1/√x ).

Now, let's write u' as (√x +1)(3 + 1/√x).

Wait, perhaps I can expand this expression to make it easier to plug in x=1 later.

Expanding:

(√x +1)(3 + 1/√x) = √x *3 + √x*(1/√x) +1*3 +1*(1/√x).

Simplify each term:

√x *3 = 3√x.

√x*(1/√x) = 1.

1*3 =3.

1*(1/√x) = 1/√x.

So, adding them up: 3√x +1 +3 +1/√x = 3√x +4 + 1/√x.

So, u' = 3√x +4 + 1/√x.

Now, going back to h''(x) = u' / u^2.

Wait, no, h''(x) is the derivative of h'(x), which we found earlier as h''(x) = u' / u^2, because h'(x) = -1/u, so h''(x) = (u')/(u^2).

Wait, let me double-check that. If h'(x) = -1/u, then h''(x) is derivative of -1/u, which is (0 - (-1) * u') / u^2, which is u' / u^2. Yes, that's correct.

So, h''(x) = u' / [u^2], where u = 2√x (√x +1)^2.

So, now, I need to compute u^2 and then evaluate both u' and u^2 at x=1.

But before plugging in x=1, maybe I can simplify the expression. Let me compute u^2.

u = 2√x (√x +1)^2.

So u^2 = [2√x (√x +1)^2]^2 = (2√x)^2 * [(√x +1)^2]^2 = 4x * (√x +1)^4.

Hmm, that's a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps I can evaluate u and u' at x=1 first, then compute h''(1) = u'(1) / [u(1)]^2.

Let me try that approach, which might be easier.

So, evaluating u and u' at x=1.

First, u at x=1:

u(1) = 2√1 * (√1 +1)^2 = 2*1 * (1+1)^2 = 2 * (2)^2 = 2*4=8.

Next, u'(1) is 3√1 +4 +1/√1 = 3*1 +4 +1/1 =3+4+1=8.

Wait, that's interesting. So u'(1)=8, and u(1)=8.

So, h''(1) = u'(1) / [u(1)]^2 = 8 / (8)^2 = 8/64 = 1/8 = 0.125.

Wait, but let me check that again because when I expanded u'(x)=3√x +4 +1/√x, at x=1, that becomes 3+4+1=8. So that's correct.

And u(1)=8, so [u(1)]^2=64. So 8/64=0.125, which is 1/8.

Looking at the options, option G is 0.125.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.

Wait, let me retrace the steps.

First, h(x)=1/(√x +1). Then, first derivative h'(x)= -1/(2√x (√x +1)^2).

Then, to find h''(x), I set h'(x) = -1/u, where u=2√x (√x +1)^2. So h''(x) = u' / u^2.

Then, I found u' by product rule, which led to u' = (√x +1)(3 +1/√x), which when expanded gave 3√x +4 +1/√x. At x=1, this is 3+4+1=8.

And u(1)=2*1*(2)^2=8.

So h''(1)=8/(8^2)=8/64=1/8=0.125. That's option G.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps, because sometimes signs can get mixed up.

Wait, h'(x) = -1/(2√x (√x +1)^2). So h'(x) = - [2√x (√x +1)^2]^(-1). Then, h''(x) is derivative of that, which is [ (2√x (√x +1)^2) ' ] / [2√x (√x +1)^2]^2. Because the derivative of 1/u is -u'/u^2, but since h'(x) is -1/u, the derivative would be (u')/u^2. Yes, that's correct.

So, I think the calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer should be 0.125, which is option G.

To find the second derivative of \( h(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x} + 1} \) at \( x = 1 \), we proceed as follows:

1. **First Derivative**:  
   Using the chain rule,  
   \[
   h'(x) = -\frac{1}{(\sqrt{x} + 1)^2} \cdot \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}} = -\frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}(\sqrt{x} + 1)^2}.
   \]

2. **Second Derivative**:  
   Let \( u = 2\sqrt{x}(\sqrt{x} + 1)^2 \). Then, \( h'(x) = -\frac{1}{u} \), and  
   \[
   h''(x) = \frac{u'}{u^2}.
   \]  
   Compute \( u' \) using the product rule:  
   \[
   u = 2\sqrt{x} \cdot (\sqrt{x} + 1)^2 \implies u' = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}(\sqrt{x} + 1)^2 + 2\sqrt{x} \cdot 2(\sqrt{x} + 1) \cdot \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}.
   \]  
   Simplifying,  
   \[
   u' = \frac{(\sqrt{x} + 1)^2}{\sqrt{x}} + 2(\sqrt{x} + 1) = 3\sqrt{x} + 4 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}.
   \]

3. **Evaluate at \( x = 1 \)**:  
   \[
   u(1) = 2\sqrt{1}(\sqrt{1} + 1)^2 = 8, \quad u'(1) = 3\sqrt{1} + 4 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{1}} = 8.
   \]  
   Thus,  
   \[
   h''(1) = \frac{u'(1)}{u(1)^2} = \frac{8}{8^2} = \frac{8}{64} = \frac{1}{8} = 0.125.
   \]

The second derivative of \( h(x) \) at \( x = 1 \) is \( 0.125 \).

**Answer:** G
