Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I have this problem about determining the energy flow out of a spherical surface due to an antenna's radiation fields. Hmm, let's see. I remember from my electromagnetics class that the power radiated by an antenna can be found using the Poynting vector. The question gives me the magnetic and electric field components, H_phi and E_theta. 

First, I think I need to recall the expression for the Poynting vector, which represents the energy flow. The average Poynting vector S is given by (E × H)*, where * denotes the complex conjugate. But wait, in terms of phasors, the time-averaged Poynting vector is (1/2) Re(E × H*). 

But wait, in this problem, the fields are given in terms of H_phi and E_theta. Since these are the radiated fields, they should be in terms of the far field, which usually follows an inverse square law, so I see that H_phi is proportional to 1/r. That makes sense because radiation fields decay as 1/r.

Now, the fields given are H_phi = (1/r) sin(theta) cos(phi - beta r) and E_theta = 377 H_phi. Wait, 377 is the impedance of free space, right? Oh, yes, because E = Z0 H, where Z0 is 377 ohms. So E_theta = Z0 H_phi. That makes sense because for plane waves in free space, E and H are related by E = Z0 H.

But wait, these are not plane waves; they're fields radiating from an antenna. However, in the far field, the relationship between E and H still holds as E = Z0 H, because the fields are approximately transverse and propagating outward. So E_theta = Z0 H_phi, which is given here. So that's correct.

Now, to find the power flow, I need to compute the Poynting vector. The Poynting vector S is E × H. But wait, in spherical coordinates, E and H are along specific directions. Here, E is in the theta direction, and H is in the phi direction. 

So, E_theta is along the r-hat direction? Wait, no. Wait, in spherical coordinates, the unit vectors are r, theta, phi. So E_theta would be in the theta direction, and H_phi in the phi direction. So E is E_theta r̂_theta, and H is H_phi r̂_phi. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, E_theta would be the component of E in the theta direction, so E is E_theta * û_theta, and H is H_phi * û_phi.

So the cross product E × H would involve the vectors in theta and phi directions. The cross product of û_theta × û_phi is... Let me think. In spherical coordinates, the cross product relations are a bit tricky. I think û_theta × û_phi = r̂ * sin(theta), but wait, no. Let me get it right. The cross product of û_theta and û_phi is given by:

û_theta × û_phi = -r̂, because the cross product order is important. Alternatively, maybe it's û_phi × û_theta = r̂. Let me think: the right-hand rule. If theta is polar angle and phi is azimuthal, then û_theta is pointing towards decreasing theta, and û_phi is pointing in the direction of increasing phi. Their cross product should point radially outward or inward. I think it's û_theta × û_phi = -r̂. Let me check: in spherical coordinates, the cross product is:

û_theta × û_phi = -(1/r) r̂ * (something?), but maybe it's better to just remember that in spherical coordinates, the cross product of unit vectors is:

û_r × û_theta = û_phi,
û_theta × û_phi = û_r,
Wait, no, perhaps it's better to use the standard cross product rules. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the determinant or the Levi-Civita symbol. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the cross product in terms of components.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the Poynting vector S is E × H. Since E is in the theta direction and H is in the phi direction, their cross product would be in the r direction (radial direction). Because in spherical coordinates, the cross product of theta and phi unit vectors gives the radial direction. So E_theta * H_phi * (unit vector in r direction) would be the cross product. But with a possible negative sign.

Wait, let me think: the cross product of û_theta and û_phi is r̂. Because using the right-hand rule: theta is like the polar angle, phi is azimuthal. So if you point your right hand in the theta direction (south), and then phi (east), the cross product should point outward, which is r̂. So û_theta × û_phi = r̂.

Wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around. Let me think: the cross product of û_theta and û_phi would give a vector in the r direction, but perhaps negative. Let me see: if theta is 0 (north), then û_theta points downward (south), and û_phi points east. So the cross product of south and east would be upward (radially outward) in the r direction. So yes, û_theta × û_phi = r̂.

Wait, but in this case, E is in theta, H in phi, so E × H would be E_theta H_phi (r̂) multiplied by the sine of the angle between them, but wait, no, because they're unit vectors, the cross product is just E_theta H_phi r̂. So the magnitude is |E_theta H_phi|, and direction is radial (r̂).

But wait, no, because the cross product of two vectors in spherical coordinates isn't just the product of their components times a unit vector. Wait, that's correct if they are along the same axis, but when they're along different axes, it's more involved. Wait, perhaps I should approach this more carefully.

The Poynting vector S is (1/2) Re(E × H*). But in phasor form, S is the time-average of the instantaneous Poynting vector. So the instantaneous S is E × H, and the average is (1/2) Re(E × H*).

But perhaps for this problem, since the fields are given in terms of phasors, the Poynting vector's magnitude would be |E × H| averaged over time, which, for sinusoidal fields, gives (1/2) |E|^2 / Z0, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate E × H directly.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that for a plane wave, S = E × H, and since E = Z0 H, then S = Z0 |H|^2, but wait, that's for a plane wave in the direction of propagation. But in this case, the fields are in theta and phi directions, which are orthogonal, so the cross product would give a radial component.

Wait, but perhaps in this case, since the fields are in theta and phi, the cross product would point radially, and the magnitude would be E_theta * H_phi.

Wait, let's think again: E is in theta, H in phi. So their cross product would be in the r direction (radial). The magnitude would be E_theta * H_phi * sin(theta), but wait, no, because the cross product in spherical coordinates involves the metric tensor. Hmm, maybe I should express the cross product in terms of components.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that for the far field, the Poynting vector's radial component is (1/2) E_theta H_phi r̂. Because the fields are perpendicular, their cross product would have a component only in the radial direction. Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think differently.

Wait, the average Poynting vector S is given by (1/2) E × H. Since E is along theta and H along phi, their cross product would be in the r direction. So the radial component S_r would be (1/2) E_theta H_phi.

Wait, but E_theta is given as 377 H_phi. So substituting that in, S_r would be (1/2) * (377 H_phi) * H_phi = (1/2) * 377 H_phi^2.

Hmm, but wait, H_phi is given as (1/r) sin(theta) cos(phi - beta r). So H_phi^2 would be (1/r^2) sin^2(theta) cos^2(...). Then, the Poynting vector's radial component is (1/2)*377*(1/r^2) sin^2(theta) cos^2(...).

But wait, to find the total power flow through the spherical surface S of radius r, I need to integrate the Poynting vector over the surface. So the power P is the integral of S_r over the surface area.

So P = ∫ S_r * dA, where dA is the area element in spherical coordinates, which is r^2 sin(theta) dtheta dphi.

So substituting S_r, we get:

P = ∫ (1/2)*377*(1/r^2) sin^2(theta) [cos^2(...)] * r^2 sin(theta) dtheta dphi

Wait, wait a second. Let me write it out:

S_r = (1/2) * 377 * H_phi^2.

H_phi is (1/r) sin(theta) cos(phi - beta r). So H_phi^2 = (1/r^2) sin^2(theta) cos^2(phi - beta r).

So S_r = (1/2) * 377 * (1/r^2) sin^2(theta) cos^2(...).

Then, dA is r^2 sin(theta) dtheta dphi.

So when I multiply S_r by dA, I get:

(1/2)*377*(1/r^2) sin^2(theta) cos^2(...) * r^2 sin(theta) dtheta dphi.

The r^2 cancels with 1/r^2, so that term becomes 1.

So S_r * dA becomes (1/2)*377 sin^3(theta) cos^2(...) dtheta dphi.

Wait, but integrating this over the entire sphere (theta from 0 to pi, phi from 0 to 2pi) would require evaluating the integral.

But wait, looking at the cos^2 term, cos^2(phi - beta r), when integrated over phi from 0 to 2pi, the integral of cos^2 over a full period is pi. Because ∫ cos^2(x) dx from 0 to 2pi is pi.

Similarly, the integral of sin^3(theta) over theta from 0 to pi would be ∫ sin^3(theta) dtheta from 0 to pi.

Let me compute that integral: ∫ sin^3(theta) dtheta from 0 to pi.

We can write sin^3(theta) = sin(theta) (1 - cos^2(theta)).

So the integral becomes ∫ sin(theta) (1 - cos^2(theta)) dtheta.

Let u = cos(theta), du = -sin(theta) dtheta.

When theta=0, u=1; theta=pi, u=-1.

So the integral becomes ∫ from u=1 to u=-1 of (1 - u^2) (-du) = ∫ from -1 to 1 of (1 - u^2) du.

Which is [u - (u^3)/3] from -1 to 1.

Evaluating at 1: (1 - 1/3) = 2/3.

At -1: (-1) - (-1/3) = -1 + 1/3 = -2/3.

So the integral is (2/3) - (-2/3) )= 4/3.

Wait, that's the integral of sin^3(theta) dtheta from 0 to pi is 4/3.

Wait, wait, let me check that again. The integral of sin^3(theta) from 0 to pi is 4/3.

So putting it all together:

P = ∫ S_r dA = ∫ [ (1/2)*377 sin^3(theta) cos^2(...) ] dtheta dphi.

We can split the integral into theta and phi parts.

Integral over phi: ∫0^{2pi} cos^2(phi - beta r) dphi = pi.

Integral over theta: ∫0^{pi} sin^3(theta) dtheta = 4/3.

So the total P becomes:

P = (1/2) * 377 * (4/3) * pi.

Wait, because the phi integral gives pi, and the theta integral is 4/3. So:

P = (1/2) * 377 * (4/3) * pi.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me compute this.

(1/2) * 377 = 188.5.

Then, 188.5 * (4/3) = 188.5 * 1.333... ≈ 251.333.

Then multiply by pi: 251.333 * 3.1416 ≈ 789. But wait, that's more than some of the options, but let's see the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: 377

B: 188.5

C: 3160

D: 6340

E: 1130

F: 1500

G: 795

H: 0

I: 2360

J: 1580

Hmm, my calculation gave approximately 789, which is close to option G:795, but perhaps I made a mistake in the integration.

Wait, let me recheck the integrals.

Wait, the phi integral: ∫0^{2pi} cos^2(phi - beta r) dphi.

Let me make substitution x = phi - beta r. Since beta r is a constant for a given r, the integral over x from ( - beta r) to (2pi - beta r) of cos^2(x) dx. But the integral of cos^2(x) over any interval of length 2pi is pi. So the integral is pi.

Theta integral: ∫0^{pi} sin^3(theta) dtheta.

As I did before, this is 4/3.

So P = (1/2) * 377 * (4/3) * pi.

Wait, 377 * (4/3) = (377 *4)/3 ≈ 499.333.

Then, 499.333 * (1/2) = 249.6665.

Multiply by pi: 249.6665 * 3.1416 ≈ 787. So approximately 787 watts.

Looking at the options, G is 795, which is very close. So the answer should be G: 795 watts.

Wait, but wait, another thought: perhaps the Poynting vector is (1/2) E × H, but in some textbooks, the average Poynting vector is (E × H)/2, but sometimes it's (1/2) Re(E × H*), which in phasor form gives the same as (E × H)/2 when the fields are in phase, which they are here. So that part seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the fact that the fields are given as H_phi and E_theta, and their cross product gives the radial component. So S_r = (E_theta H_phi) / (2) because E × H gives S_r as (E_theta H_phi) / 2.

Wait, but in the problem statement, E_theta is 377 H_phi, so substituting that in, S_r = (377 H_phi^2)/2.

Then, the power is the integral of S_r over the surface, which is ∫ (377/2) H_phi^2 * r^2 sin(theta) dtheta dphi / r^2.

Wait, because H_phi is (1/r) sin(theta) cos(...), so H_phi^2 is (1/r^2) sin^2(theta) cos^2(...).

So when you multiply by r^2 (from dA = r^2 sin(theta) dtheta dphi), the 1/r^2 cancels, and you get:

P = ∫ (377/2) sin^2(theta) cos^2(...) * sin(theta) dtheta dphi.

So that becomes (377/2) ∫ sin^3(theta) dtheta ∫ cos^2(...) dphi.

Which is what I did before, leading to P ≈ 787 W, which is very close to option G:795.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the integral values. Let me recalculate the numerical part.

Compute (1/2) * 377 * (4/3) * pi.

(1/2)*377 = 188.5.

188.5 * (4/3) = 188.5 * 1.3333... ≈ 251.333.

251.333 * pi ≈ 251.333 * 3.1416 ≈ 789. So approximately 789 W.

Wait, but option G is 795, which is very close. So perhaps the correct answer is G:795 watts.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the integral of sin^3(theta). Let me recompute that.

∫ sin^3(theta) dtheta from 0 to pi.

Using substitution: let u = cos(theta), du = -sin(theta) dtheta.

So ∫ sin^3(theta) dtheta = ∫ (1 - u^2) (-du) from u=1 to u=-1.

Which becomes ∫ (1 - u^2) du from u=-1 to u=1.

= [ u - (u^3)/3 ] from -1 to 1.

At u=1: 1 - 1/3 = 2/3.

At u=-1: (-1) - (-1/3) = -1 + 1/3 = -2/3.

So the integral is (2/3) - (-2/3) )= 4/3. So that's correct.

Hmm, maybe I should check if 377 * (4/3) * pi/2 is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should write it as:

P = (1/2) * 377 * (4/3) * pi.

Because the (1/2) comes from the Poynting vector, and the (4/3) from the theta integral, and pi from the phi integral.

So:

377 * (4/3) = 499.333.

Multiply by (1/2): 249.6665.

Multiply by pi: 249.6665 * 3.1416 ≈ 787.

So around 787, which is very close to option G:795.

But wait, perhaps I missed a factor somewhere. Let me think again.

Wait, the Poynting vector S_r is (E_theta H_phi)/2, right? Because E × H gives a vector in r direction, and the average power is (1/2) Re(E × H*), which, for sinusoidal fields in phase, is (1/2) E H.

So S_r = (E_theta H_phi)/2.

Then, E_theta = 377 H_phi, so S_r = (377 H_phi^2)/2.

Then, when I integrate S_r over the sphere, I have:

P = ∫ S_r * dA = ∫ (377/2) H_phi^2 * r^2 sin(theta) dtheta dphi.

But H_phi = (1/r) sin(theta) cos(phi - beta r).

So H_phi^2 = (1/r^2) sin^2(theta) cos^2(...).

Substituting this in:

P = ∫ (377/2) * (1/r^2) sin^2(theta) cos^2(...) * r^2 sin(theta) dtheta dphi.

The r^2 cancels, so:

P = (377/2) ∫ sin^3(theta) cos^2(...) dtheta dphi.

Which splits into two integrals:

= (377/2) [ ∫ sin^3(theta) dtheta ] [ ∫ cos^2(...) dphi ]

As before, ∫ sin^3(theta) dtheta from 0 to pi is 4/3, and ∫ cos^2(...) dphi from 0 to 2pi is pi.

So:

P = (377/2) * (4/3) * pi.

= (377 * 4) / (2*3) ) * pi.

= (1508) / 6 * pi.

= (754/3) * pi ≈ 251.333 * 3.1416 ≈ 789.

So about 789 watts, which aligns with option G:795. So I think the correct answer is G.

To determine the energy flow out of the spherical surface \( S \) of radius \( r \), we use the Poynting vector, which represents the average power flow. The given fields are \( H_\phi = \frac{1}{r} \sin\theta \cos(\omega t - \beta r) \) and \( E_\theta = 377 H_\phi \), where \( 377 \, \Omega \) is the impedance of free space. 

The Poynting vector \( S \) is given by \( S = \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{H} \). Since \( E_\theta \) is along the \( \theta \)-direction and \( H_\phi \) is along the \( \phi \)-direction, their cross product \( \mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{H} \) points radially outward (in the \( r \)-direction). The magnitude of the Poynting vector is:

\[
S_r = \frac{1}{2} E_\theta H_\phi
\]

Substituting \( E_\theta = 377 H_\phi \), we get:

\[
S_r = \frac{1}{2} (377 H_\phi^2)
\]

Substituting \( H_\phi = \frac{1}{r} \sin\theta \cos(\omega t - \beta r) \), we find:

\[
S_r = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 377 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{r^2} \sin^2\theta \cos^2(\omega t - \beta r) \right)
\]

The power \( P \) radiated is the integral of \( S_r \) over the spherical surface area \( dA = r^2 \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi \):

\[
P = \int_S S_r \, dA = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^\pi \frac{1}{2} \cdot 377 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} \sin^2\theta \cos^2(\omega t - \beta r) \cdot r^2 \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi
\]

Simplifying:

\[
P = \frac{377}{2} \int_0^{2\pi} \cos^2(\omega t - \beta r) \, d\phi \int_0^\pi \sin^3\theta \, d\theta
\]

The integral over \( \phi \) is:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} \cos^2(\omega t - \beta r) \, d\phi = \pi
\]

The integral over \( \theta \) is:

\[
\int_0^\pi \sin^3\theta \, d\theta = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Substituting these results:

\[
P = \frac{377}{2} \cdot \pi \cdot \frac{4}{3} = \frac{377 \cdot 4 \cdot \pi}{6} \approx 787 \, \text{W}
\]

This value is closest to option **G: 795 watts**.

ANSWER: G
