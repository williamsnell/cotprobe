Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why both the price of cars and the price of steel have gone up. The question says the automobile industry is fairly competitive, and the supply of steel is constant in the short run. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, I know that prices go up when either demand increases or supply decreases. Since the industry is competitive, I don't think it's a matter of monopolies or cartels. So maybe it's something on the demand side.

Looking at the options, option A is increased taxes on car sales. If taxes go up, that might make cars more expensive, but would that directly cause an increase in demand? I'm not so sure. Taxes would probably just add to the cost, but maybe reduce demand because cars become pricier. So that might not explain a price increase unless it's a supply-side issue.

Option B is decreased demand for cars. If demand goes down, prices should go down too, right? So that's probably not the reason.

Option C is increased demand for cars. That makes sense because if more people want cars, the price would go up, especially in a competitive market where supply can't immediately adjust. But wait, the question also mentions steel prices going up. How does that tie in?

Steel is a key component in making cars. If the demand for cars increases, the demand for steel (which is used to make cars) would also increase. But the question says the supply of steel is constant in the short run. So if demand for steel goes up but supply doesn't change, the price of steel would rise. That fits with both car and steel prices going up.

Option D is decreased supply of steel. But the question states that the supply is constant in the short run. So D might not be the right choice because it's assuming a supply decrease, which isn't happening here.

Option E is technological advancements. If car manufacturing becomes more efficient, that might lower costs, which could lower car prices. But if the technology is new and maybe there are costs involved, perhaps it could increase prices. Wait, but in a competitive market, lower costs would allow companies to lower prices to gain more market share. So maybe E isn't the main reason here.

Putting it all together, the most plausible reason is that the demand for cars has increased (option C). This higher demand for cars would, in turn, increase the demand for steel. Since the supply of steel isn't increasing in the short run, its price goes up as well. So both the car and steel prices rise because of higher demand for cars.

The upsurge in car and steel prices can be explained by an increased demand for cars (Option C). As more people want cars, the competitive automobile industry faces higher demand, which can lead to price increases. Additionally, the increased demand for cars raises the demand for steel, a key component, but since steel supply is constant in the short run, its price also rises.
