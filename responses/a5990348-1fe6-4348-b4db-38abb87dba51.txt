Question:

Complete the following example using deductive reasoning: All students who attend the Peddie School study Latin. Some students who study Latin also study calculus. Jerome is a student at the Peddie School. It can therefore be determined that

C: Jerome studies either calculus or Latin, but not both
D: Jerome studies calculus
E: Jerome studies calculus but not Latin
F: Jerome studies either calculus or Latin
G: Jerome studies both calculus and Latin
H: Jerome studies neither calculus nor Latin
I: Jerome does not study Latin
J: Jerome studies both calculus and Latin, but only if he chooses to

Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by breaking down the information given.

First, the problem says, "All students who attend the Peddie School study Latin." So, if someone is a student at Peddie, they must be studying Latin. That means 100% of them study Latin. So, for example, if I pick any student from there, like Jerome, he definitely studies Latin. That's straightforward.

Next, it says, "Some students who study Latin also study calculus." Hmm, okay. So, not all Latin students study calculus, but some do. That means that there's an overlap between the group of Latin students and calculus students. So, some people study both, but others might only study Latin.

Now, the person in question is Jerome, who is a student at Peddie School. From the first statement, we know he studies Latin. The question is, what can we determine about whether he studies calculus?

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Jerome does not study calculus. Well, the second statement says some Latin students study calculus. It doesn't say that all do, but it also doesn't say that none do. So, we can't conclude that he doesn't study calculus. He might or might not.

Option B: Jerome studies Latin. Yes, this is directly from the first statement. Since he's a Peddie student, he must study Latin. So B seems correct, but let's see if there's more.

Option C: Jerome studies either calculus or Latin, but not both. Wait, the problem doesn't say anything about exclusive study. He could study both, so this option is too restrictive. We can't conclude this.

Option D: Jerome studies calculus. No, because the second statement only says some Latin students study calculus, not all. So we can't assume he does.

Option E: Jerome studies calculus but not Latin. No, because we know he studies Latin, so this is impossible.

Option F: Jerome studies either calculus or Latin. But since he definitely studies Latin, this is redundant. He must study Latin, so whether he studies calculus is uncertain.

Option G: Jerome studies both calculus and Latin. We can't conclude this because while some Latin students study calculus, we don't know if Jerome is among them.

Option H: Jerome studies neither calculus nor Latin. No, because he's a Peddie student, so he must study Latin.

Option I: Jerome does not study Latin. No, because all Peddie students study Latin.

Option J: Jerome studies both, but only if he chooses. This is similar to G but adds a condition. We can't determine that because it depends on his choice, which isn't provided.

So, the only thing we can be certain of is that Jerome studies Latin. Therefore, the correct answer should be B.

The statements provided allow us to conclude that Jerome studies Latin because all students at the Peddie School do so. However, the information about calculus is only that some Latin students study it, which doesn't apply to all. Therefore, the only definite conclusion is that Jerome studies Latin.

Answer: B
