Okay, so I need to figure out when the first Jaina temples appeared. I'm not too familiar with Jainism, but I know it's an ancient Indian religion. Let me think about what I remember.

Jainism, along with Buddhism, emerged as a reaction against the caste system in Hinduism. I think it's one of the oldest religions in India, maybe around the same time as Buddhism. Wait, wasn't there a guy named Mahavira who was a key figure in Jainism? I think he was a contemporary of the Buddha, so that would place him around the 5th or 6th century BCE.

Now, temples usually come into play after a religion has some structure and establishment. Jainism probably started with more of an ascetic tradition, with monks and such, but temples would have come later as the community settled and needed places for worship and rituals.

Looking at the options, I see BCE and CE options. The earlier options are BCE, like the 11th, 10th, etc., and the later ones are CE, like the 1st, 5th, 8th centuries. I'm trying to remember when exactly the first temples were built. I think Jainism's institutionalization happened after Mahavira, maybe a few centuries after his time.

Wait, the Mauryan Empire was around 322â€“185 BCE, and Ashoka was a big emperor there. Did he have any influence on Jainism? I think he was more into Buddhism, but maybe Jainism started to gain more structure around that time or slightly after.

So if Mahavira was in the 5th century BCE, perhaps the first temples started appearing a few centuries after his death. Let's see, the options include the 3rd century BCE (option H) and the 5th century CE (option I). I'm leaning towards the 5th or 6th century BCE for the origins, but the temples might have come later.

Wait, but the question is about the first temples, not the origins of the faith. Temples often require a settled society and some level of wealth to build. The Mauryan period might have been a time when Jainism started to establish itself more, but maybe the actual temples came a bit later.

I think the first Jaina temples might have appeared around the 1st century CE. That's option C. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it was the 5th century BCE, but that's the time of Mahavira himself, so perhaps the temples came later.

Another angle: looking at other Indian religions, like Hinduism, their temples started appearing around the Gupta period, which was around the 3rd-5th century CE. But Jainism is older, so maybe their temples came earlier.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall any specific information. I think the Jaina community started building temples with idols around the 1st century CE. So that would make option C correct.

The first Jaina temples likely appeared around the 1st century CE, as Jainism transitioned from an ascetic tradition to a more structured religious practice with communal worship. This aligns with the timeline of societal development and the establishment of religious institutions during that period. 

Answer: C
