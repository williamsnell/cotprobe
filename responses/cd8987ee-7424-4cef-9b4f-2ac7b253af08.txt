Question:

Although theoretically any food protein could act as a food allergen, there are eight major food allergens in Europe and North America which account for most of the allergic triggers observed in childhood. Which of the allergens pairings contains an allergen, which is not part of the group of eight major allergens?


Options:

A: Fish, shellfish
B: Soy, peanuts
C: Mustard seeds, lamb,

Okay, so I have this question about food allergens, and I need to figure out which option contains an allergen that's not part of the eight major ones. Let me start by recalling what I know about food allergies.

The question says that there are eight major food allergens in Europe and North America that cause most childhood allergies. I remember these are often referred to as the "big eight." I think they include things like milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, and soy. Let me list them out to be sure: Milk, Eggs, Fish, Shellfish (like crustaceans and mollusks), Tree Nuts, Peanuts, Wheat, and Soy. Yeah, that's the big eight.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Fish, shellfish. Both fish and shellfish are definitely part of the big eight. So this pair is all allergens in the group. So the question is asking for a pair where one isn't part of the group. So A is not the answer.

Option B: Soy, peanuts. Soy is one of the eight, and peanuts are also part of the big eight. So both are included, so B isn't the right answer either.

Option C: Mustard seeds, lamb. Hmm, I don't remember mustard seeds being one of the major eight. Let me think. The big eight are milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, and soy. Mustard isn't in that list. Lamb is a meat, but the big eight include fish and shellfish, not other meats like beef, pork, or lamb. So mustard seeds and lamb are not part of the eight.

Wait, but the question is asking which pair contains an allergen that's NOT part of the group. So in option C, both mustard seeds and lamb are not part of the eight. But the question is about a pair where one is not part of the group. Wait, no, the question is which pair contains an allergen which is not part of the group. So looking for a pair where at least one is not in the group.

Wait, actually, let me read the question again: "Which of the allergens pairings contains an allergen, which is not part of the group of eight major allergens?" So each pairing has two allergens; we need to find the pair where one of them is not in the eight.

So, looking at the options:

A: Fish and shellfish are both in the eight. So none are excluded here.

B: Soy and peanuts are both in the eight. So both are included.

C: Mustard seeds and lamb. Neither is in the eight. So the pair is made up of allergens outside the eight. Therefore, the correct answer would be C because both are not part of the eight, but the question is which pair contains an allergen not in the group, meaning at least one. But wait, the question says "an allergen which is not part," so perhaps any one in the pair. So in C, both are not part of the eight, so this pair definitely includes allergens not in the group.

Alternatively, the other options don't have any allergen outside the group. So the answer is C.

The question asks which pair of allergens contains at least one allergen not part of the eight major food allergens in Europe and North America. The eight major allergens are milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, and soy. 

- **Option A**: Fish and shellfish are both part of the eight major allergens. 
- **Option B**: Soy and peanuts are also both part of the eight major allergens. 
- **Option C**: Mustard seeds and lamb are not part of the eight major allergens. 

Since the question asks for a pair containing an allergen not part of the group, the correct answer is **C**, as both mustard seeds and lamb are outside the eight major allergens.

Answer: C
