Okay, so I have this question about Holocene Africa and the replacement of certain cultures or tools. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my African prehistory, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking what was replaced by what in Holocene Africa. The options are A to J, each pairing two things. Let me start by recalling what I know about these terms.

First, the Holocene epoch began around 11,700 years ago, following the end of the Pleistocene. So we're talking about the transition into the current epoch, which in Africa would involve various cultural and technological changes.

Looking at the options, I see terms like Iberomaurusian, Maglemosian, Natufian, Capsian, backed blade, microlith blade. I need to figure out which replaced which.

I remember that the Capsian culture is associated with the North Africa region, particularly the Maghreb. Capsian toolkits often include items like the "backed blade," which are blades with one sharp edge and a backed edge, possibly used forhafting tools or other purposes. The Capsian is thought to have emerged around the end of the Paleolithic period, maybe around 9,000 years ago.

The Iberomaurusian culture is another North African culture that's a bit earlier than the Capsian. It's known for its use of microliths, which are small stone tools, often used as tips for projectiles or in other composite tools. I think microliths are more commonly associated with the Iberomaurusian and perhaps earlier periods.

So, maybe the Iberomaurusian culture was replaced by the Capsian culture. That would fit because the Capsian comes later and has different tool technologies. Let me check the options. Option C says Iberomaurusian replaced by Capsian. That seems plausible.

Wait, but I need to make sure. The question is about what was replaced by what. So if Iberomaurusian was replaced, the first blank would be Iberomaurusian and the second Capsian. So option C is Iberomaurusian; Capsian, which matches that.

Another option to consider is D: Natufian; Iberomaurusian. Natufian is a Levantine culture, though, not African. So that might not fit here.

Option J is Capsian replaced by Iberomaurusian, which would be the opposite of what I was thinking, so probably not.

What about the tool options? Backed blade vs. microlith. I think backed blades are more common in the Capsian, while microliths are in Iberomaurusian. So if the Iberomaurusian was replaced, their tools (microliths) would be replaced by backed blades. So looking at the tool options, if the question was about tools, it would be microlith blade replaced by backed blade. But the question is about cultures.

So the correct answer is about cultures, so the Iberomaurusian culture being replaced by the Capsian culture. That points to option C.
