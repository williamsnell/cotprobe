Okay, so I've got this question about the regions of the abdomen and I need to figure out which one lies just distal to the sternum. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the abdomen is divided into nine regions, but the options here are a bit different. The question is asking about which region is just below the sternum. The sternum is the breastbone, right? So the area right below that would be the upper part of the abdomen.

Looking at the options, I need to recall where each region is located. Let me list out what I remember about each option:

A: Pectoral – That's more like the chest area, not part of the abdomen. Probably in the thoracic region.

B: Iliac – I think that's near the hip bones, so lower down on the sides.

C: Subcostal – Sub means under, so under the costal regions. Costal regions are along the ribs, so subcostal would be just below the ribs. That might be near the area just under the sternum.

D: Umbilical – Around the belly button, which is the center, so not near the sternum.

E: Hypochondriac – These are the regions just below the ribcage, so upper abdomen. There are two hypochondriac regions, right? Left and right, just under the ribs.

F: Epigastric – I think this is the central upper part, like where the stomach is. So just below the sternum might be part of the epigastric region.

G: Costal – Along the sides, under the ribs, so maybe not directly below the sternum.

H: Inguinal – Lower part, near the groin.

I: Hypogastric – That's the lower abdomen, below the umbilical region.

J: Lumbar – That's the lower back area, part of the spine, not abdomen.

Wait, the question is about the region just distal to the sternum. So the sternum is the front of the ribcage. The area right below it would be the upper abdomen.

I remember that the epigastric region is in the center, just below the sternum. The hypochondriac regions are on the sides, just under the ribs. So the area directly below the sternum would be the epigastric region.

Alternatively, I think subcostal might refer to under the costal (rib) areas, which would be along the sides, maybe not directly below the sternum. So the answer is likely F: Epigastric.

The region just distal to the sternum is the epigastric region, which is located in the upper central abdomen.

Answer: F
