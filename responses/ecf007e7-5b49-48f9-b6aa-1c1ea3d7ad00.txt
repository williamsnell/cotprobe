Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to find the specific gravity of an iron bar. Hmm, I remember specific gravity is related to density, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think this through step by step.

First, the problem says the mass of the iron bar is 320 grams. Its dimensions are 2 cm by 2 cm by 10 cm. Oh wait, right, specific gravity is the ratio of the object's density to the density of water. Since water's density is 1 g/cm³, specific gravity is just the density of the object in g/cm³.

So I need to calculate the density of the iron bar. Density is mass divided by volume. I know the mass is 320 grams. Now, what's the volume? The bar is rectangular, so its volume is length × width × height. Let me calculate that.

The dimensions are 2 cm, 2 cm, and 10 cm. Multiplying them together: 2 * 2 = 4, then 4 * 10 = 40. So the volume is 40 cubic centimeters.

Wait, no, wait a second. Did I get the multiplication right? 2 × 2 is 4, and 4 × 10 is indeed 40 cm³. Yeah, that's correct.

Now, density is mass over volume. Mass is 320 grams, volume is 40 cm³. So 320 divided by 40. Let me do that calculation. 320 ÷ 40 equals 8. So the density is 8 g/cm³.

Since specific gravity is the same as density in this case (because water's density is 1), the specific gravity is 8. Looking at the options, H is 8. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me double-check. Mass is 320g, volume is 40 cm³. 320/40 is 8, yes. And specific gravity is density relative to water, so it's 8. Yep, that's solid.

The specific gravity of the iron bar is 8, which corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
