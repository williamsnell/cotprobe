Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this problem about the catalytic ammonia converter. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try my best.

The reaction given is N₂ + 3H₂ ⇌ 2NH₃. They mentioned that 1 mol of nitrogen reacts with 3 mol of hydrogen. The operating conditions are 100 atm pressure and 350°C. The equilibrium constant K is given as 14.4 × 10^-5 at 500°C, but wait, the reaction is at 350°C. Hmm, that might be a problem because the K value is specified at a different temperature. Oh, but wait, the problem says the enthalpy ΔH° is -25,800 cal/g-mol at the desired temperature, which is 350°C. So I think I can use the given K value as it's provided, assuming maybe it's a typo or perhaps they want us to proceed with the given K regardless of the temperature discrepancy. I'll proceed with K = 1.44e-4.

The question is to find the equilibrium conversion of nitrogen to ammonia. So I need to find the extent to which N₂ is converted into NH₃ at equilibrium under these conditions.

I remember that for gas-phase reactions, the equilibrium constant Kp is expressed in terms of partial pressures. Since all standard states are pure components at 1 atm, the reaction quotient will be based on partial pressures relative to 1 atm.

Let me set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) for the reaction.

Let’s denote the extent of reaction as 'x'. So, for every mole of N₂ that reacts, 3 moles of H₂ react, and 2 moles of NH₃ are produced.

Assumption: Initially, we have pure N₂ and H₂, so let's say we start with 1 mole of N₂ and 3 moles of H₂. But wait, the problem says it's a continuously fed converter, so perhaps the initial concentrations are based on the stoichiometric amounts. Hmm, maybe I should think about it differently. Alternatively, maybe to model it as a closed system where the initial moles are 1 mol N₂ and 3 mol H₂ in a container, and then the reaction proceeds.

Wait, but in a converter, it's a continuous process, so perhaps the initial concentrations are based on the feed. Let me think: the feed is 1 mol N₂ and 3 mol H₂. Let's assume that the system starts with these amounts, and some amount 'x' reacts.

But wait, the system is under 100 atm pressure. So the initial partial pressures would be based on their mole fractions. Wait, no, because pressure is total pressure. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps I should model it using mole fractions.

Wait, maybe it's better to consider the reaction in terms of mole fractions and partial pressures.

Let me define the initial moles as follows:

Initially, before reaction:
n_N2 = 1 mol
n_H2 = 3 mol
n_NH3 = 0 mol

At equilibrium, the moles will change by 'x' for N₂, '3x' for H₂ (since 3 mol H₂ react per 1 mol N₂), and '2x' for NH₃.

So, at equilibrium:
n_N2 = 1 - x
n_H2 = 3 - 3x
n_NH3 = 2x

The total moles at equilibrium would be n_total = (1 - x) + (3 - 3x) + 2x = 4 - 0x = 4 mol.

Wait, that's interesting. The total moles don't change because the reaction is N₂ + 3H₂ → 2NH₃. Reactant moles: 1 + 3 =4, product moles: 2. So total moles decrease by 2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, initial moles are 4 (1+3). After reaction, moles are (1-x) + (3-3x) + 2x = 1 +3 -x -3x +2x =4 -2x. So the total moles at equilibrium are 4 - 2x.

Wait, but that's different from what I thought earlier. So I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that.

So, n_total = (1-x) + (3-3x) + 2x = 4 -2x.

The pressure is given as 100 atm. But I'm not sure if this is the total pressure or just the initial pressure. Wait, the problem says the converter is operated at 100 atm and 350°C. So perhaps the initial pressure is 100 atm, but as the reaction proceeds, the total pressure changes. But in reality, the pressure would adjust, but perhaps for the purpose of this problem, we can assume that the pressure is held constant at 100 atm. Hmm, but that's a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the pressure is the total pressure, and the partial pressures are based on mole fractions.

Wait, but in the ICE table, if the total pressure is 100 atm, and the reaction is in a closed system, the total pressure would change as the reaction proceeds. But maybe the problem assumes that the system is under constant pressure, so the total pressure remains 100 atm. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the partial pressures based on the mole fractions and the total pressure.

Wait, but perhaps another approach is to express the partial pressures in terms of the mole fractions times the total pressure.

Let me think: Let’s denote the total pressure as P_total = 100 atm.

At equilibrium, the partial pressures are:

P_N2 = (n_N2 / n_total) * P_total = [(1 - x)/(4 - 2x)] * 100 atm

Similarly,

P_H2 = (3 - 3x)/(4 - 2x) * 100 atm

P_NH3 = (2x)/(4 - 2x) * 100 atm

But wait, the equilibrium expression uses partial pressures relative to their standard states, which are pure substances at 1 atm. So Kp is expressed as (P_NH3)^2 / (P_N2 * (P_H2)^3) ) = K = 1.44e-4.

So plugging in the partial pressures:

( (2x/(4-2x) * 100 )^2 ) / ( ( (1 - x)/(4-2x) * 100 ) * ( (3 - 3x)/(4-2x) * 100 )^3 ) ) = 1.44e-4

Hmm, that looks complicated. Let me try to simplify this expression.

Let me factor out the 100s:

Numerator: (2x/(4-2x) * 100)^2 = (100^2) * (4x²)/(4-2x)^2

Denominator: [(1-x)/(4-2x) *100] * [(3-3x)/(4-2x)*100]^3 = (100 * (1-x)/(4-2x)) * (100^3 * (3-3x)^3)/(4-2x)^3 )

So denominator becomes: 100^4 * (1-x)(3-3x)^3 / (4-2x)^4 )

Putting it all together:

[100^2 * 4x²/(4-2x)^2 ] / [100^4 * (1-x)(3-3x)^3/(4-2x)^4 ) ] 

= [4x²/(4-2x)^2 ] * [ (4-2x)^4 ) / (100^2 * (1-x)(3-3x)^3) ) ]

Wait, let me compute the exponents:

100^2 / 100^4 = 100^(2-4) = 100^-2 = 1/(100^2)

Similarly, (4-2x)^4 / (4-2x)^2 = (4-2x)^(4-2) = (4-2x)^2

So the expression becomes:

4x² * (4-2x)^2 / ( (100^2) * (1-x) * (3-3x)^3 ) ) = K = 1.44e-4

Hmm, that's still a bit messy. Let me see if I can factor this better.

First, note that 4-2x = 2*(2 - x). Similarly, 3-3x = 3*(1 - x).

So let me rewrite the terms:

4x² * [2^2 (2 - x)^2 ] / [ (100^2) * (1 - x) * (3^3 (1 - x)^3) ) ]

Wait, 4x² * (4-2x)^2 becomes 4x² * [2(2 - x)]^2 = 4x² *4*(2 - x)^2 = 16x² (2 - x)^2.

Wait, wait, 4-2x is 2*(2-x), so (4-2x)^2 = [2*(2-x)]^2 = 4*(2-x)^2.

So the numerator becomes 4x² * 4*(2 - x)^2 = 16x² (2 - x)^2.

The denominator:

(100^2) * (1 - x) * [3^3 (1 - x)^3)] = 100^2 * 3^3 * (1 - x)^4.

So putting it all together:

16x² (2 - x)^2 / (100^2 * 27 * (1 - x)^4 ) = K = 1.44e-4.

Wait, because 3^3 is 27.

So:

16x² (2 - x)^2 / ( (100^2)(27) (1 - x)^4 ) ) = 1.44e-4.

Let me compute the constants:

16 / (100^2 * 27) = 16 / (10000 * 27) = 16 / 270000 ≈ 0.000059259.

So the equation becomes:

0.000059259 * x² (2 - x)^2 / (1 - x)^4 = 1.44e-4.

Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let me write this as:

(x² (2 - x)^2 ) / (1 - x)^4 = (1.44e-4) / 0.000059259 ≈ (1.44e-4)/(5.9259e-5) ≈ approx 2.43.

Wait, let me compute that division more accurately.

1.44e-4 divided by 5.9259e-5:

1.44e-4 = 0.000144

5.9259e-5 =0.000059259

So 0.000144 / 0.000059259 ≈ 2.43.

So, (x² (2 - x)^2 ) / (1 - x)^4 ≈ 2.43.

Hmm, that's a difficult equation to solve algebraically. Maybe I can take the square root of both sides to simplify.

Taking square roots:

sqrt( (x² (2 - x)^2 ) ) / sqrt( (1 - x)^4 ) = sqrt(2.43) ≈ 1.56.

So, (x (2 - x) ) / (1 - x)^2 ) ≈ 1.56.

Let me write that as:

x(2 - x) = 1.56 (1 - x)^2.

Expanding both sides:

Left side: 2x - x².

Right side: 1.56 (1 - 2x + x²) = 1.56 - 3.12x + 1.56x².

Now, bring all terms to one side:

2x - x² -1.56 + 3.12x -1.56x² = 0.

Combine like terms:

(2x +3.12x) + (-x² -1.56x²) -1.56 = 0.

So, 5.12x - 2.56x² -1.56 =0.

Rearranging:

-2.56x² +5.12x -1.56 = 0.

Multiply both sides by -1 to make the quadratic coefficient positive:

2.56x² -5.12x +1.56 =0.

Now, let's solve for x using the quadratic formula.

a=2.56, b=-5.12, c=1.56.

Discriminant D = b² -4ac = (5.12)^2 -4*(2.56)*(1.56).

Compute 5.12^2: 5.12*5.12 = 26.2144.

4*2.56*1.56: 4*2.56=10.24; 10.24*1.56≈15.9744.

So D=26.2144 -15.9744=10.24.

Square root of D is sqrt(10.24)=3.2.

So x = [5.12 ±3.2]/(2*2.56).

Compute both possibilities:

x1 = (5.12 +3.2)/(5.12) = 8.32/5.12 ≈ 1.625.

x2 = (5.12 -3.2)/(5.12) =1.92/5.12=0.375.

Now, x represents the extent of reaction, which can't be more than 1 because we started with 1 mol of N₂. So x=1.625 is not feasible. Therefore, x≈0.375.

So x≈0.375, meaning 37.5% conversion of N₂ to NH₃.

Wait, but the options don't have 37.5%. Let me check the options again.

Options are: A:70%, B:40%, C:35%, D:60%, E:65%, F:50%, G:30%, H:45%, I:75%, J:54%.

Hmm, 37.5% is close to option C:35% or option J:54%. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my approximations.

Wait, perhaps when I took the square root, I approximated sqrt(2.43)=1.56, but let me check that again. Let me compute sqrt(2.43):

1.56^2=2.4336, which is very close to 2.43. So that was correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should check the exact equation before taking square roots.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption that the system starts with 1 mol N₂ and 3 mol H₂ is incorrect. Maybe the initial moles are different.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the system is under constant pressure, but the initial moles are such that the partial pressures are based on their stoichiometric amounts. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should model the problem using the reaction quotient and the given K.

Another approach: Let me assume that the initial moles are 1 mol N₂ and 3 mol H₂, and the system is under 100 atm pressure. So the initial partial pressures are:

P_N2_initial = (1/(1+3)) * 100 atm =25 atm.

Similarly, P_H2_initial= (3/(1+3)) *100=75 atm.

P_NH3_initial=0.

At equilibrium, let the change be x for N₂ converting to NH₃.

So, moles at equilibrium:

N₂: 1 - x

H₂:3 - 3x

NH3: 2x

Total moles: (1 -x) + (3-3x) + 2x =4 -2x.

So, partial pressures are:

P_N2 = ( (1 -x)/(4 -2x) ) *100 atm.

P_H2 = ( (3 -3x)/(4 -2x) ) *100 atm.

P_NH3 = (2x/(4-2x)) *100 atm.

The equilibrium expression is:

Kp = (P_NH3)^2 / (P_N2 * (P_H2)^3 ) =1.44e-4.

Plugging in the partial pressures:

[ (2x/(4-2x) *100 )^2 ] / [ ( (1 -x)/(4-2x)*100 ) * ( (3 -3x)/(4-2x) *100 )^3 ) ] =1.44e-4.

Let me compute this step by step.

Numerator: [ (2x *100)/(4-2x) ) ]^2 = (200x)^2 / (4-2x)^2 =40000x²/(4-2x)^2.

Denominator: [ (100(1-x))/(4-2x) ) ] * [ (100(3-3x))/(4-2x) ) ]^3.

= [100(1-x)/(4-2x)] * [100^3 (3-3x)^3)/(4-2x)^3)] 

= 100^4 (1-x)(3-3x)^3 / (4-2x)^4.

So putting it all together:

(40000x²/(4-2x)^2) / ( (100^4 (1-x)(3-3x)^3)/(4-2x)^4 )) ) =1.44e-4.

Simplify the denominators:

= 40000x²/(4-2x)^2 * (4-2x)^4)/(100^4 (1-x)(3-3x)^3 )

= 40000x² (4-2x)^2 / (100^4 (1-x)(3-3x)^3 ).

Set this equal to 1.44e-4:

40000x² (4-2x)^2 / (100^4 (1-x)(3-3x)^3 ) =1.44e-4.

Let me compute the constants:

40000 = 4e4.

100^4 =1e8.

So 4e4 /1e8 =4e-4.

So, 4e-4 * x² (4-2x)^2 / [ (1-x)(3-3x)^3 ] =1.44e-4.

Divide both sides by 4e-4:

x² (4-2x)^2 / [ (1-x)(3-3x)^3 ] = (1.44e-4)/(4e-4) )=0.36.

So, x² (4-2x)^2 / [ (1-x)(3(1-x))^3 ] =0.36.

Simplify denominator:

3^3=27, and (1-x)^4.

So, denominator becomes 27 (1-x)^4.

So:

x² (4-2x)^2 / ( 27 (1-x)^4 ) =0.36.

Let me compute (4-2x)^2= (2(2-x))^2=4(2-x)^2.

So:

x² *4*(2-x)^2 / (27 (1-x)^4 ) =0.36.

Multiply both sides by 27:

4x² (2-x)^2 / (1-x)^4 )= 0.36 *27=9.72.

So,

4x² (2-x)^2 / (1-x)^4 =9.72.

Take square root of both sides:

sqrt(4x²(2-x)^2) / (1-x)^2 )= sqrt(9.72)=3.118.

sqrt(4x²(2-x)^2)=2x(2-x).

So,

2x(2-x) / (1-x)^2 =3.118.

Multiply both sides by (1-x)^2:

2x(2-x) =3.118 (1 -2x +x²).

Expand both sides:

Left: 4x -2x².

Right:3.118 -6.236x +3.118x².

Bring all terms to left:

4x -2x² -3.118 +6.236x -3.118x²=0.

Combine like terms:

(4x +6.236x) + (-2x² -3.118x²) -3.118=0.

=10.236x -5.118x² -3.118=0.

Rearranged:

-5.118x² +10.236x -3.118=0.

Multiply both sides by -1:

5.118x² -10.236x +3.118=0.

Use quadratic formula:

x=(10.236 ±sqrt( (10.236)^2 -4*5.118*3.118 )) / (2*5.118).

Compute discriminant:

(10.236)^2 ≈104.78.

4*5.118*3.118≈4*15.97≈63.89.

So D≈104.78-63.89≈40.89.

sqrt(40.89)=6.395.

So x=(10.236 ±6.395)/(10.236).

Compute both roots:

x1=(10.236+6.395)/10.236≈16.631/10.236≈1.624 → invalid as x can't exceed 1.

x2=(10.236-6.395)/10.236≈3.841/10.236≈0.375.

So x≈0.375, so 37.5% conversion.

Looking back at the options, the closest is C:35% and J:54%. Hmm, but 37.5% isn't an option. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the pressure is 100 atm, but the standard state is 1 atm, so perhaps I should adjust the partial pressures accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use Kc instead of Kp, but the problem states to use ideal gas and Lewis-Randall behavior, which suggests Kp is appropriate.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is written per mole of N₂, so the initial moles are 1 N₂, 3 H₂, and 0 NH3.

Let me define x as the fraction of N₂ that reacts. So, at equilibrium:

N₂: 1 -x

H₂:3 -3x

NH3:2x

The total moles would be (1-x) + (3-3x) +2x=4-2x.

The partial pressures are:

P_N2 = (1 -x)/(4-2x) *100 atm.

P_H2 = (3-3x)/(4-2x)*100 atm.

P_NH3= (2x)/(4-2x)*100 atm.

The equilibrium expression:

Kp = (P_NH3)^2/(P_N2 * (P_H2)^3 )=1.44e-4.

Plugging in:

[ (2x/(4-2x)*100 )^2 ] / [ ( (1-x)/(4-2x)*100 ) * ( (3-3x)/(4-2x)*100 )^3 ] =1.44e-4.

Simplify the numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (2x *100/(4-2x))² = (200x/(4-2x))²=40000x²/(4-2x)^2.

Denominator: [ (100(1-x)/(4-2x)) ] * [ (100(3-3x)/(4-2x)) ]^3 = [100(1-x)/(4-2x)] * [100^3 (3-3x)^3/(4-2x)^3 ] =100^4 (1-x)(3-3x)^3 / (4-2x)^4.

So the equation becomes:

40000x²/(4-2x)^2 * (4-2x)^4 / (100^4 (1-x)(3-3x)^3 ) =1.44e-4.

Simplify:

40000x² (4-2x)^2 / (100^4 (1-x)(3-3x)^3 )=1.44e-4.

Compute constants:

40000 =4e4.

100^4=1e8.

So 4e4 /1e8=4e-4.

Thus:

4e-4 * x² (4-2x)^2 / [ (1-x)(3-3x)^3 ] =1.44e-4.

Divide both sides by4e-4:

x² (4-2x)^2 / [ (1-x)(3-3x)^3 ] = (1.44e-4)/(4e-4)=0.36.

Simplify denominator:

(3-3x)=3(1-x), so (3-3x)^3=27(1-x)^3.

So denominator becomes (1-x)*27(1-x)^3=27(1-x)^4.

Thus:

x² (4-2x)^2 / [27 (1-x)^4 ] =0.36.

Multiply both sides by27:

x² (4-2x)^2 / (1-x)^4 =9.72.

Take square root:

x(4-2x)/(1-x)^2 =sqrt(9.72)=3.118.

So:

x(4-2x)=3.118 (1-x)^2.

Expand right side:

3.118(1-2x +x²).

Left side:4x -2x².

So equation becomes:

4x -2x² =3.118 -6.236x +3.118x².

Bring all terms to left:

4x -2x² -3.118 +6.236x -3.118x²=0.

Combine like terms:

(4x +6.236x) + (-2x² -3.118x²) -3.118=0.

=10.236x -5.118x² -3.118=0.

Rearranged:

-5.118x² +10.236x -3.118=0.

Multiply by -1:

5.118x² -10.236x +3.118=0.

Using quadratic formula:

x=(10.236 ±sqrt( (10.236)^2 -4*5.118*3.118 )) / (2*5.118).

Compute discriminant:

10.236^2≈104.78.

4*5.118*3.118≈4*15.97≈63.88.

So D≈104.78-63.88=40.9.

sqrt(40.9)=6.397.

So x=(10.236 ±6.397)/(10.236).

First solution: (10.236+6.397)/10.236≈16.633/10.236≈1.624 → invalid.

Second solution: (10.236-6.397)/10.236≈3.839/10.236≈0.375.

So x≈0.375, which is 37.5% conversion.

But the options don't have 37.5%. The closest option is C:35% and J:54%. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect. Maybe the pressure affects the calculation differently. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the van 't Hoff equation to adjust K from 500°C to 350°C, but the problem provided K at 500°C and ΔH° at 350°C, which complicates things. Wait, but the problem states that K is 1.44e-4 at 500°C, but the reaction is at 350°C. So perhaps I should calculate K at 350°C using the van 't Hoff equation.

Wait, that's a possibility I didn't consider earlier. The given K is at 500°C, but the reaction is run at 350°C. So I need to adjust K to the reaction temperature.

The van 't Hoff equation is ln(K2/K1) = -ΔH°/R (1/T2 -1/T1).

Wait, but I need to be careful with the signs. Let me get the equation right.

The van 't Hoff equation:

ln(K2/K1) = (ΔH°/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2)/(1).

Because ΔH is negative (exothermic reaction), so K decreases as temperature increases.

Given:

K1 =1.44e-4 at T1=500°C=773.15 K.

We need K2 at T2=350°C=623.15 K.

ΔH°= -25,800 cal/g-mol. Wait, but units are important. R is usually in J/(mol·K), so perhaps I should convert ΔH to J.

1 cal=4.184 J. So ΔH°= -25,800 cal/g-mol *4.184 J/cal * (g·mol^-1) → Wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with units.

Wait, ΔH is given as -25,800 cal/g·mol. So per gram per mole? That seems unusual. Wait, perhaps it's -25,800 cal/(mol), not per gram. Because standard enthalpy is per mole.

Wait, perhaps the units are -25,800 cal/mol. Let me assume that. So ΔH°= -25,800 cal/mol.

Convert to J: 25,800 cal/mol *4.184 J/cal=25,800 *4.184 ≈108,535.2 J/mol. So ΔH°= -108535.2 J/mol.

R=8.314 J/(mol·K).

Now, compute ln(K2/K1)= (ΔH°/R)(1/T1 -1/T2).

Plugging in the values:

ln(K2/(1.44e-4))= (-108535.2)/(8.314) * (1/773.15 -1/623.15).

Compute the terms:

1/773.15 ≈0.001293, 1/623.15≈0.001605.

Difference: 0.001293 -0.001605= -0.000312.

Multiply by ΔH/R:

(-108535.2)/8.314 ≈-13055. So,

ln(K2/1.44e-4)= -13055 * (-0.000312)≈13055 *0.000312≈4.064.

So,

ln(K2/1.44e-4)=4.064 → K2/1.44e-4= e^(4.064)≈59.3.

Thus, K2=1.44e-4 *59.3≈0.008539.

Wait, that's a big increase in K, which makes sense because the reaction is exothermic (ΔH negative), so K increases when temperature decreases.

So now, K at 350°C is approximately 8.54e-3.

Now, using this K, let's recompute the equilibrium conversion.

So, Kp=8.54e-3.

Now, proceed with the ICE table again.

The equation is:

( (2x/(4-2x)*100 )^2 ) / ( ( (1-x)/(4-2x)*100 ) * ( (3-3x)/(4-2x)*100 )^3 ) =8.54e-3.

Simplify as before:

40000x² (4-2x)^2 / (100^4 (1-x)(3-3x)^3 )=8.54e-3.

Which becomes:

4e4 x² (4-2x)^2 / (1e8 (1-x)(3-3x)^3 )=8.54e-3.

Simplify 4e4 /1e8=4e-4.

So,

4e-4 x² (4-2x)^2 / [ (1-x)(3-3x)^3 ]=8.54e-3.

Multiply both sides by 2.5e3 (1/4e-4):

x² (4-2x)^2 / [ (1-x)(3-3x)^3 ]= (8.54e-3)/(4e-4)=21.35.

So,

x² (4-2x)^2 / [ (1-x)(3-3x)^3 ]=21.35.

Simplify denominator:

3-3x=3(1-x), so denominator is (1-x)*27(1-x)^3)=27(1-x)^4.

So,

x² (4-2x)^2 / [27 (1-x)^4 ]=21.35.

Multiply both sides by 27:

x² (4-2x)^2 / (1-x)^4 =576.45.

Take square root:

x(4-2x)/(1-x)^2 =sqrt(576.45)=24.01.

So,

x(4-2x)=24.01 (1-x)^2.

Expanding:

4x -2x²=24.01(1 -2x +x²).

=24.01 -48.02x +24.01x².

Bring all terms to left:

4x -2x² -24.01 +48.02x -24.01x²=0.

Combine like terms:

(4x +48.02x) + (-2x² -24.01x²) -24.01=0.

=52.02x -26.01x² -24.01=0.

Rearranged:

-26.01x² +52.02x -24.01=0.

Multiply by -1:

26.01x² -52.02x +24.01=0.

Using quadratic formula:

x=(52.02 ±sqrt(52.02^2 -4*26.01*24.01))/(2*26.01).

Compute discriminant:

52.02^2≈2705.28.

4*26.01*24.01≈4*624.24≈2496.96.

So D≈2705.28-2496.96≈208.32.

sqrt(208.32)=14.43.

So,

x=(52.02 ±14.43)/(52.02).

First solution: (52.02+14.43)/52.02≈66.45/52.02≈1.277 → invalid.

Second solution: (52.02-14.43)/52.02≈37.59/52.02≈0.722.

So x≈0.722, which is 72.2% conversion. But this is higher than any of the options. The closest option is I:75% and J:54%.

Wait, but this seems high. Let me check the calculations again. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the van 't Hoff calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the van 't Hoff steps.

Given:

K1=1.44e-4 at T1=500°C=773.15 K.

ΔH°=-25,800 cal/mol → converted to J: -25,800 *4.184= -108,535.2 J/mol.

R=8.314 J/(mol·K).

Compute ln(K2/K1)= (ΔH°/R)(1/T1 -1/T2).

Wait, the correct van 't Hoff equation is:

ln(K2/K1) = (ΔH°/R) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ] / (1).

Wait, but since ΔH is negative, and T2<T1, (1/T1 -1/T2) is negative, so the whole term becomes positive, leading to K2>K1.

Let me compute the exact values:

1/T1=1/773.15≈0.001293 K^-1.

1/T2=1/623.15≈0.001605 K^-1.

So,

1/T1 -1/T2=0.001293 -0.001605= -0.000312 K^-1.

ΔH°/R= (-108535.2)/8.314≈-13055 K.

So,

ln(K2/K1)= (-13055) * (-0.000312)=4.064.

So,

ln(K2)= ln(1.44e-4) +4.064.

ln(1.44e-4)=ln(1.44)+ln(1e-4)=0.3662 -9.2103≈-8.8441.

So,

ln(K2)= -8.8441 +4.064≈-4.7801.

Thus,

K2=exp(-4.7801)=approx 8.54e-3. That part was correct.

So K2=8.54e-3.

Now, proceed with K=8.54e-3.

Set up the equation again:

( (2x/(4-2x)*100 )^2 ) / ( ( (1-x)/(4-2x)*100 ) * ( (3-3x)/(4-2x)*100 )^3 ) =8.54e-3.

Simplify:

40000x²/(4-2x)^2 * (4-2x)^4/(1e8 (1-x)(3-3x)^3 )=8.54e-3.

Which becomes:

4e4 x² (4-2x)^2 / (1e8 (1-x)(3-3x)^3 )=8.54e-3.

Simplify constants:

4e4 /1e8=4e-4.

So,

4e-4 x² (4-2x)^2 / [ (1-x)(3-3x)^3 ]=8.54e-3.

Multiply both sides by 1e4/4:

x² (4-2x)^2 / [ (1-x)(3-3x)^3 ]= (8.54e-3 *1e4)/4=85.4/4=21.35.

Which is the same as before. So the equation is correct.

Proceeding to solve:

x(4-2x)/(1-x)^2=24.01.

Which led to x≈0.722, but that's 72% conversion, which isn't among the options.

Hmm, perhaps I made an error in the van 't Hoff calculation. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the pressure affects the reaction quotient differently. Alternatively, perhaps the assumption that the initial moles are 1 and 3 is incorrect. Maybe the initial pressures are 100 atm for N₂ and 300 atm for H₂, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the reaction is under standard pressure (1 atm), but the total pressure is 100 atm, so partial pressures are adjusted accordingly. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the reaction is at constant pressure, and the extent of reaction is such that the total pressure changes. But this complicates the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the approach, and I should use the ideal gas law to express concentrations in terms of pressure and volume.

Wait, perhaps another approach: let me express the reaction in terms of mole fractions.

At equilibrium, the mole fractions are:

y_N2 = (1-x)/(4-2x)

y_H2 = (3-3x)/(4-2x)

y_NH3=2x/(4-2x)

The reaction quotient Kp is:

Kp = (P_NH3^2)/(P_N2 * P_H2^3 )

But P_total=100 atm.

So,

P_NH3= y_NH3 * P_total = (2x/(4-2x)) *100.

Similarly for others.

But this brings me back to the same equation as before.

Alternatively, perhaps I should assume that the reaction is at standard pressure (1 atm), but the problem states the converter operates at 100 atm. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should use the reaction quotient in terms of concentrations, but since it's a gas-phase reaction, Kp is more appropriate.

Given the time I've spent and the options provided, perhaps the correct answer is around 37% conversion, which is closest to option C:35%. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the van 't Hoff calculation, and K remains 1.44e-4, leading to x≈0.375, which is 37.5% conversion.

Given the options, the closest is C:35% or J:54%. But 37.5% is closer to 35% than to 54%. However, perhaps the correct approach didn't require adjusting K, and the initial K was correct, leading to x≈0.375, which is 37.5%, not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the van 't Hoff step.

Wait, perhaps the van 't Hoff equation should be applied differently. Let me recheck.

The van 't Hoff equation is:

ln(K2/K1) = -(ΔH°)/R (1/T2 - 1/T1)/1.

Wait, I might have mixed up the signs. Let me rederive it.

The correct form is:

ln(K2/K1) = (ΔH°/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2)/(1) when ΔH is positive.

But since ΔH is negative, the equation becomes:

ln(K2/K1) = (ΔH°/R)(1/T1 -1/T2).

Wait, no. Let me get the correct form.

The van 't Hoff equation is:

ln(K2/K1) = (ΔH°/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2)/(1).

But since ΔH is negative, and T2<T1, (1/T1 -1/T2) is negative, so the whole term is positive, leading to K2>K1.

Wait, but earlier calculation gave K2=8.54e-3, which is higher than K1=1.44e-4, which makes sense.

So perhaps the earlier calculation is correct, leading to x≈0.722, which is 72% conversion, but that's not an option.

Hmm, perhaps the problem didn't require adjusting K, and the K given is at 350°C. The problem states K is 1.44e-4 at 500°C, but the reaction is at 350°C. So perhaps I should have used the given K without adjusting, leading to x≈0.375, which is 37.5% conversion.

Since the options don't have 37.5%, perhaps the intended answer is C:35%.
</think>

To calculate the equilibrium conversion of nitrogen to ammonia in the catalytic converter, the reaction \( \text{N}_2 + 3\text{H}_2 \rightleftharpoons 2\text{NH}_3 \) is analyzed under the given conditions: 100 atm pressure, 350°C, and equilibrium constant \( K = 1.44 \times 10^{-4} \) at 500°C. The enthalpy of reaction \( \Delta H^\circ = -25,800 \, \text{cal/mol} \) is provided at 350°C.

### Key Steps:
1. **ICE Table Setup**:  
   Let \( x \) represent the extent of reaction. Initially, 1 mol of \( \text{N}_2 \) and 3 mol of \( \text{H}_2 \) are present. At equilibrium:
   - \( [\text{N}_2] = 1 - x \),
   - \( [\text{H}_2] = 3 - 3x \),
   - \( [\text{NH}_3] = 2x \).

2. **Partial Pressures**:  
   Total moles at equilibrium: \( n_{\text{total}} = 4 - 2x \).  
   Partial pressures are calculated as:
   \[
   P_{\text{N}_2} = \frac{(1 - x)}{(4 - 2x)} \cdot 100, \quad
   P_{\text{H}_2} = \frac{(3 - 3x)}{(4 - 2x)} \cdot 100, \quad
   P_{\text{NH}_3} = \frac{(2x)}{(4 - 2x)} \cdot 100.
   \]

3. **Equilibrium Expression**:  
   Using \( K_p = \frac{(P_{\text{NH}_3})^2}{P_{\text{N}_2} \cdot (P_{\text{H}_2})^3} \), substitute the partial pressures:
   \[
   K_p = \frac{\left(\frac{2x \cdot 100}{4 - 2x}\right)^2}{\left(\frac{(1 - x) \cdot 100}{4 - 2x}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{(3 - 3x) \cdot 100}{4 - 2x}\right)^3}.
   \]

4. **Simplification**:  
   After simplifying, the equation becomes:
   \[
   \frac{4x^2 (2 - x)^2}{(1 - x)^4} = 2.43.
   \]
   Taking the square root and solving for \( x \) yields \( x \approx 0.375 \), corresponding to a 37.5% conversion of \( \text{N}_2 \) to \( \text{NH}_3 \).

5. **Adjusting \( K \) Using van 't Hoff Equation**:  
   The given \( K \) is at 500°C, but the reaction occurs at 350°C. Using the van 't Hoff equation:
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{K_2}{K_1}\right) = \frac{\Delta H^\circ}{R} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right),
   \]
   where \( \Delta H^\circ = -25,800 \, \text{cal/mol} \), \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \), \( T_1 = 773.15 \, \text{K} \), and \( T_2 = 623.15 \, \text{K} \), the adjusted \( K_2 \) at 350°C is calculated as \( K_2 \approx 8.54 \times 10^{-3} \).

6. **Recomputing with Adjusted \( K \)**:  
   Substituting \( K_2 = 8.54 \times 10^{-3} \) into the equilibrium expression and solving for \( x \) yields a higher conversion, approximately 72%. However, this value is not among the provided options.

### Conclusion:
The closest equilibrium conversion to the calculated value of 37.5% is **35%**, corresponding to **Option C**.
