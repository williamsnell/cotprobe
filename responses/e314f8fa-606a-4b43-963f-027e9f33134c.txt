Okay, so I have this problem about partners sharing net income based on their average investments. The partners are Boy Alcott and Jon Buxton in a steel company. I need to figure out each of their shares of the $8,736 profit for the year. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when partners share profits based on their average investment, I need to calculate each partner's investment over the entire year, considering the changes in their investments at different times. The key here is to compute the average balance for each partner and then find the ratio of their investments.

Let me list out the dates and the amounts each partner invested or withdrew:

- January 1:
  - Alcott invests $4,000.
  - Buxton invests $5,000.

- May 1:
  - Alcott adds $2,000, so his total becomes $4k + $2k = $6k.
  - Buxton adds $1,750, so his total becomes $5k + $1.75k = $6,750.

- September 1:
  - Alcott withdraws $500, so his investment drops to $6k - $0.5k = $5,500.

- November 1:
  - Both invest an additional $2,000 each. Alcott goes from $5,500 to $7,500, and Buxton from $6,750 to $8,750.

Now, I need to figure out how long each investment was held during the year. The year is 365 days, but since the changes happen on specific dates, I'll calculate the number of days each investment was active.

Let me list the periods and the amount each had during those periods.

For Alcott:

- From Jan 1 to May 1: 4 months. But wait, January 1 to May 1 is 4 months, but how many days? Let me count:

January has 31 days, February 28 (assuming it's not a leap year), March 31, April 30, and May 1 is the next day. Wait, but May 1 is the date he added, so the period before is from Jan 1 to April 30.

Wait, maybe it's easier to consider the periods as:

1. Jan 1 to May 1: 4 months (but May 1 is the start of the next period). So, the first period is 4 months (Jan to April), but actually, from Jan 1 to May 1 is 4 months and 0 days. So, each month's days can be considered as 30 for simplicity, but perhaps better to calculate exact days.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of months. Alternatively, since each period is a certain number of months, I can compute the average by multiplying the amount by the number of months it was held, sum them all, and then divide by 12 to get the average.

Let me try that approach.

Alcott's investments:

- $4,000 from Jan 1 to May 1: that's 4 months (Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr) → 4 months.
- Then he adds $2k on May 1, making it $6k. This amount remains until Sep 1, which is 4 months later (May, Jun, Jul, Aug) → 4 months.
- Then he withdraws $500 on Sep 1, so now he has $5,500. This is from Sep to Nov 1: that's 2 months (Sep and Oct), but Nov 1 is the next change, so 2 months.
- On Nov 1, he adds another $2k, making it $7,500. This remains for the remaining 1 month (Nov to Dec 31). So that's 2 months? Wait, Nov 1 to Dec 31 is 1 month and 30 days, but for simplicity, maybe just consider it as 2 months? Wait, no, from Nov 1 to Nov 30 is 1 month, and then Dec 1 to Dec 31 is another month, so total 2 months.

Wait, perhaps breaking it down into exact days would be more accurate. Let me calculate the exact number of days each investment was held.

Days in each period:

1. Jan 1 to May 1: January (31) + February (28) + March (31) + April (30) = 31+28+31+30 = 120 days. So 120 days at $4,000.

2. May 1 to Sep 1: May (31) + June (30) + July (31) + August (31) → Wait, Sep 1 is the next day, so up to August 31? Wait, Sep 1 is the start of the next period. So May 1 to August 31 is 4 months. Wait, May to August is 4 months, but days would be May (31), June (30), July (31), August (31) → 31+30+31+31=123 days. So 123 days at $6,000.

3. Sep 1 to Nov 1: September (30) + October (31) → 30+31=61 days at $5,500.

4. Nov 1 to Dec 31: November (30) + December (31) = 61 days (but wait, Nov 1 to Nov 30 is 30 days, and Dec 1 to Dec 31 is 31 days, so total 61 days) at $7,500.

Now, let's calculate Alcott's total investment days:

- $4,000 × 120 days.
- $6,000 × 123 days.
- $5,500 × 61 days.
- $7,500 × 61 days.

Wait, but I think I'm complicating it. Alternatively, I can compute the average investment by considering the time each amount was held and then find the weighted average.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute the average investment for each partner by considering the midpoints. But I'm not sure. Maybe it's easier to compute the total investment multiplied by the number of months each was held, sum them, and then divide by 12 to get the average per month.

So let's compute for Alcott:

1. Jan 1 to May 1: 4 months (since May 1 is the start of the next period). Investment: $4,000. So 4 × 4,000 = 16,000.

2. May 1 to Sep 1: 4 months (since Sep 1 is the next change). Investment: $6,000. So 4 × 6,000 = 24,000.

3. Sep 1 to Nov 1: 2 months. Investment: $5,500. So 2 × 5,500 = 11,000.

4. Nov 1 to end of year: 2 months. Investment: $7,500. So 2 × 7,500 = 15,000.

Total for Alcott: 16,000 + 24,000 + 11,000 + 15,000 = 66,000.

Average investment for Alcott: 66,000 / 12 = 5,500.

Wait, but that can't be right because his investment fluctuates. Let me check the months again.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact days and then compute the average.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute the average investment for each partner by considering each period and the time it was held, then sum each partner's total investment multiplied by the time, then divide by 365 days to get the average.

Let me try that.

For Alcott:

1. From Jan 1 to May 1: 120 days at $4,000. So 120 × 4,000 = 480,000.

2. From May 1 to Sep 1: 123 days at $6,000. 123 × 6,000 = 738,000.

3. From Sep 1 to Nov 1: 61 days at $5,500. 61 × 5,500 = 335,500.

4. From Nov 1 to Dec 31: 61 days at $7,500. 61 × 7,500 = 457,500.

Total for Alcott: 480,000 + 738,000 + 335,500 + 457,500 = let's add them step by step.

480k + 738k = 1,218,000.

1,218k + 335.5k = 1,553,500.

1,553,500 + 457,500 = 2,011,000.

Average investment for Alcott: 2,011,000 / 365 ≈ 5,504.11 per day. Multiply by 365 to get the average investment? Wait, no, the average is total investment days divided by 365. Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, the average investment is the total investment multiplied by the number of days it was held, summed up, then divided by 365. So for Alcott:

Total investment days: (4,000 × 120) + (6,000 × 123) + (5,500 × 61) + (7,500 × 61).

Calculating each:

4,000 × 120 = 480,000

6,000 × 123 = 738,000

5,500 × 61 = 335,500

7,500 × 61 = 457,500

Total = 480,000 + 738,000 = 1,218,000

1,218,000 + 335,500 = 1,553,500

1,553,500 + 457,500 = 2,011,000

Average investment = 2,011,000 / 365 ≈ 5,504.11

Wait, but 365 × 5,504 ≈ 365 × 5,500 = 1,997,500 plus 365 ×4=1,460 → total 2,000, 1,997,500 + 1,460 = 2,000, 960? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the time in months. Since each month has roughly the same weight, maybe I can compute the average by considering the midpoints of each period.

Wait, another approach: compute the average investment for each partner by taking the amount multiplied by the number of months it was held, then sum those and divide by 12.

Let's try that for Alcott:

1. $4,000 for 4 months (Jan-April).

2. $6,000 for 4 months (May-August).

3. $5,500 for 2 months (September-November 1).

Wait, from Sep 1 to Nov 1 is 2 months, but actually, Sep has 30 days, so Sep 1 to Nov 1 is 61 days, which is roughly 2 months. So perhaps 2 months.

4. $7,500 for 2 months (Nov to end of year: Nov and December).

Wait, but from Nov 1 to Dec 31 is 1 month (Nov) plus 31 days in Dec, which is 30 days in Nov (if starting Nov 1). Hmm, maybe better to consider as 2 months.

So, using months:

Alcott's average investment = (4,000 ×4 + 6,000 ×4 + 5,500 ×2 + 7,500 ×2 ) /12

Calculating:

4,000×4 = 16,000

6,000×4 =24,000

5,500×2=11,000

7,500×2=15,000

Total = 16k +24k=40k; 40k +11k=51k; 51k+15k=66k.

Average = 66,000 /12 = 5,500.

So Alcott's average investment is $5,500.

Now for Buxton.

Buxton's investments:

- Jan 1: $5,000.

- May 1: adds $1,750 → total $6,750.

- Sep 1: no change for Buxton, so still $6,750 until Nov 1.

- Nov 1: adds $2,000 → total $8,750.

So periods for Buxton:

1. Jan 1 to May 1: 4 months at $5,000.

2. May 1 to Sep 1: 4 months at $6,750.

3. Sep 1 to Nov 1: 2 months at $6,750.

4. Nov 1 to Dec 31: 2 months at $8,750.

Wait, but let's check the exact days:

1. From Jan 1 to May 1: 120 days at $5,000.

2. From May 1 to Sep 1: 123 days at $6,750.

3. From Sep 1 to Nov 1: 61 days at $6,750.

4. From Nov 1 to Dec 31: 61 days at $8,750.

Alternatively, using months:

1. Jan-April: 4 months at $5,000.

2. May-August: 4 months at $6,750.

3. September-November 1: 2 months at $6,750.

4. November to December: 2 months at $8,750.

Calculating average investment using months:

Buxton's average = (5,000×4 + 6,750×4 + 6,750×2 + 8,750×2) /12

Compute each part:

5,000×4=20,000

6,750×4=27,000

6,750×2=13,500

8,750×2=17,500

Total = 20k +27k=47k; 47k+13.5k=60.5k; 60.5k +17.5k=78k.

Average =78,000 /12=6,500.

So Buxton's average investment is $6,500.

Now, the total average investment is Alcott's 5,500 + Buxton's 6,500 = 12,000.

The net profit is $8,736, so the ratio of their shares is 5,500 : 6,500, which simplifies to 11:13.

So the total parts =11+13=24.

Each part is 8,736 /24= 364.

So Alcott's share:11×364=4,004.

Buxton's share:13×364=4,732.

Looking at the options, option B is Alcott:4,004 and Buxton:4,732.
</think>

The partners' shares are calculated based on their average investments. Alcott's average investment is $5,500, and Buxton's is $6,500, giving a ratio of 11:13. The profit is divided accordingly, resulting in Alcott receiving $4,004 and Buxton receiving $4,732.

B
