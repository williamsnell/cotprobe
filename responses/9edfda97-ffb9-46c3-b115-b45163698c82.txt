Okay, so I've got this question about armature windings in a machine, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what it's asking.

The question has two parts, (i) and (ii). Part (i) is further divided into (a) and (b). 

Starting with part (i)(a): It says a triplex lap-wound armature is used in a 14-pole machine with fourteen brush sets, each spanning three commutator bars. I need to calculate the number of paths in the armature.

Hmm, I remember that in armature windings, the number of paths depends on the type of winding—lap or wave. For a lap-wound armature, the number of paths (A) is equal to the number of parallel paths, which is given by the formula A = P * (m), where P is the number of poles and m is the number of parallel paths per pole. Wait, no, more accurately, for a lap winding, the number of parallel paths A is equal to the number of poles (P) multiplied by the number of parallel paths per pole. But wait, wait, I think I'm mixing up terms here.

Wait, no, I think for a lap winding, the number of parallel paths A is equal to the number of poles (P) times the number of parallel paths per pole. But in a triplex lap winding, each pole has three parallel paths because it's triplex. So each pole has 3 paths. So for a 14-pole machine, the total paths A would be P * m, where m is the number of paths per pole. But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe it's better to recall the formula for the number of parallel paths in a lap winding. The formula is A = (number of poles * number of parallel paths per pole). But wait, in a standard lap winding, the number of parallel paths per pole is determined by the way the coils are connected. For a triplex lap winding, each pole has three parallel paths. So for each pole, there are three parallel coils. Therefore, the total number of paths in the armature would be P * m, where m is 3, so 14 * 3 = 42 paths.

Wait, but wait another thing. I think I might be mixing up the terminology. Triplex lap means that each path has three coils in series. No, wait, no, perhaps the number of parallel paths per pole is given by the number of triplex, which is 3. So for each pole, the number of parallel paths is 3. So total paths would be 14 * 3 = 42. So part (a) would have 42 paths.

Wait, but another thought: the number of parallel paths in a lap winding is equal to the number of poles multiplied by the number of paths per pole. So if it's triplex, each pole contributes 3 paths, so 14 *3=42. So that's (a) done.

Now part (i)(b): Repeat (a) for a triplex wave-wound armature with two brush sets and 14 poles. So now it's a wave winding.

Wait, in wave windings, the number of parallel paths A is equal to the number of poles (P) times 2, but wait, that's only for a simplex wave. Wait, no, wait. Wait, for a wave winding, the formula for the number of parallel paths is A = (number of poles) * (number of parallel paths per pole). But in a simplex wave, each pole has one parallel path, so A = P. But for a triplex wave, each pole has three parallel paths. So for 14 poles, A would be 14 *3=42? But wait, that can't be right because I remember that in wave windings, the number of parallel paths also depends on the number of brush sets. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should recall that in a wave winding, the number of parallel paths A is equal to the number of poles multiplied by the number of parallel paths per pole. But in a simplex wave, each pole has 1 parallel path, so A = P. But in a triplex wave, each pole has 3 parallel paths, so A= P *3. So for 14 poles, A=14*3=42.

But wait, the problem says it's a triplex wave-wound armature with two brush sets. Hmm, but in a wave winding, the number of brush sets is equal to the number of parallel paths, I think. Because each brush set corresponds to a parallel path. So if there are two brush sets, that would imply two parallel paths, but that can't be right because the triplex wave has more.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me think again.

Wait, in wave windings, the number of parallel paths is 2 for a simplex wave. Because in simplex wave, each pole contributes one parallel path, but the total number of paths is 2, because the two ends of each pole are connected. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, for a simplex wave winding, the number of parallel paths is equal to the number of poles. Because each pole has one parallel path, so for P poles, you have P parallel paths. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me get this straight.

Wait, perhaps I should refer to the formula. For a wave wound armature, the number of parallel paths A is equal to the number of poles (P). Because each pole contributes one path. So in a simplex wave (each pole has 1 parallel path), A = P. But in a triplex wave, each pole has three parallel paths, so A = 3P. But wait, that would make 3P paths, but that can't be right because in a wave winding, the number of paths is equal to the number of poles, regardless of the multiplexing. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of parallel paths in a wave winding is equal to the number of poles, and for a triplex wave, each pole has three coils in series per path. Wait, no, that would complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of parallel paths in a wave winding is given by the number of poles multiplied by the number of parallel paths per pole. So for a simplex wave (1 path per pole), A = P. For a triplex wave, 3 per pole, so A=3P.

But in the problem, part (b) is a triplex wave-wound armature with two brush sets and 14 poles. So P=14. So if each pole has 3 paths, then A=14*3=42. But wait, that can't be right because in wave windings, the number of brush sets is equal to the number of parallel paths. Because each path is connected to a brush set. So if you have two brush sets, that would imply two parallel paths, which would mean A=2. But that's conflicting with the idea of triplex.

Wait, perhaps I've got this wrong. Let me try to think again. In a wave winding, the number of parallel paths is equal to the number of poles, because each pole's two ends are connected to form a path. Wait, no, that's for simplex wave. Wait, no, perhaps the number of parallel paths in a wave winding is 2, regardless of the number of poles. Because each pole contributes one path, but since there are two poles per phase, maybe that's not right.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to find a better approach.

I think I should look up the formula for the number of paths in a lap and wave winding.

In a lap winding:

Number of parallel paths (A) = P * m, where m is the number of parallel paths per pole. For a simplex lap, m=1, so A=P. For triplex lap, m=3, so A= P *3.

In a wave winding:

Number of parallel paths (A) = m * (P / 2), where m is the number of parallel paths per pole. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting it wrong again.

Wait, another approach: In wave windings, the number of parallel paths is equal to the number of poles. Because each pole contributes one path, so for P poles, A = P. But that's for simplex wave. For a triplex wave, each pole has three paths, so A = 3 * P.

Wait, but that would make A= 14 *3=42, which seems high, but if the number of brush sets is two, that can't be right because each brush set is for a path. So if there are two brush sets, that would imply two paths. So this is conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let's read it again: (b) is a triplex wave-wound armature having two such brush sets and 14 poles.

Wait, so number of brush sets is two. Each brush set corresponds to a path, so A=2. But that can't be right because it's a triplex wave. Hmm, perhaps the number of brush sets is equal to the number of parallel paths. So if there are two brush sets, that implies two parallel paths. So A=2, but that would mean m=2/P=2/14, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Wait, in a wave winding, the number of parallel paths (A) is given by A = (number of poles) * (number of parallel paths per pole) / 2. Or perhaps it's A = (number of poles) * (number of parallel paths per pole). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the number of parallel paths in a wave winding is A = (number of poles) / (number of brush sets). So if there are two brush sets, and 14 poles, then A =14 /2=7. But I'm not confident about that.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The number of parallel paths in a wave winding is equal to the number of brush sets. Because each brush set connects to one path. So if there are two brush sets, A=2. But that would mean that in a triplex wave with two brush sets, A=2. But that seems conflicting with the idea of triplex.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of parallel paths in a wave winding is equal to the number of brush sets. So if it's two brush sets, then A=2. But then the triplex part refers to the number of coils per path.

Wait, maybe I should think about the calculation. Let me try to proceed.

In part (i)(a), for the lap winding, I think the number of paths is 42, as calculated earlier.

In part (i)(b), for the wave winding with two brush sets, the number of paths would be two. But wait, that doesn't align with the triplex part. Alternatively, perhaps the number of paths is determined by the number of poles divided by the number of brush sets. So 14 poles and 2 brush sets would imply 7 paths. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should look for a formula. I remember that in a wave-wound armature, the number of parallel paths (A) is equal to the number of poles divided by the number of brush sets. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of parallel paths is equal to the number of brush sets. So if there are two brush sets, A=2. But then for a triplex wave, each path has three coils in series. So perhaps the number of paths is 2.

Wait, but that seems to conflict with the idea that triplex implies three paths per pole. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe in a triplex wave, each pole has three paths, so with 14 poles, A=14 *3=42. But the problem says there are two brush sets, which would suggest two paths, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the number of brush sets is equal to the number of parallel paths. So if there are two brush sets, then A=2. So in part (b), the number of paths is 2.

But that would mean that in a triplex wave, each path has multiple coils, but the number of paths is determined by the number of brush sets.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of the options given. Looking at the options, part (i)(a) has 42 paths as an option in F (42 paths; 6 paths) and in other options. Part (i)(b) in F is 6 paths. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps in a wave winding, the number of paths is equal to the number of brush sets. So if there are two brush sets, A=2. So for part (i)(b), the number of paths is 2.

Wait, but looking at the options, for part (i)(a), 42 is in option F, and for (i)(b), 6 is in F as well. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to proceed to part (ii) and see if that helps.

Part (ii) asks to calculate the generated emf in each of the above problems. The given parameters are: flux per pole is 4.2 ×10^6 lines, speed is 60 rpm, and there are 420 coils on the armature, each with 20 turns.

Wait, so for each part (a) and (b), I need to calculate the generated emf.

The formula for generated emf in a DC machine is E = (φ * Z * N * P) / (60 * A), where:
- φ is flux per pole (in Weber),
- Z is total number of coils,
- N is speed in rpm,
- P is number of poles,
- A is number of parallel paths.

Wait, but wait, Z is the number of coils, but each coil has multiple turns. So the formula might be E = (φ * Z * turns * N * P) / (60 * A).

Wait, but Z is the total number of coils. Each coil has 20 turns, so the total conductors would be Z * turns. But wait, in the formula, Z is the number of coils, and each has 'a' turns, so the formula is E = (φ * Z * a * N * P) / (60 * A).

Wait, but I think the formula is E = (φ * P * N * Z * a) / (60 * A), where Z is the number of coils, a is the number of turns per coil.

Alternatively, another formula I've heard is E = (φ * P * N * A') / (60 * A), where A' is the number of coils per path. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of conductors. Each coil has 'a' turns, so total conductors = Z * a.

In a machine, the generated emf is given by E = (φ * P * N * (Z * a)) ) / (60 * A).

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident about this. Let me double-check.

Wait, the formula for the generated emf in a DC machine is:

E = (φ * P * N * Z * a) / (60 * A)

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, I've seen it written as:

E = (φ * P * N * Z * a) / (60 * A)

Where:
- φ = flux per pole (Wb),
- P = number of poles,
- N = speed (rpm),
- Z = number of coils,
- a = number of turns per coil,
- A = number of parallel paths.

So, applying this formula to both (a) and (b).

First, for part (i)(a): A=42 paths.

So, E = (φ * P * N * Z * a) / (60 * A)

Given:
φ = 4.2e6 lines = 4.2e-1 Weber (since 1 Wb = 10^8 lines),
P=14,
N=60 rpm,
Z=420 coils,
a=20 turns,
A=42.

Plugging in:

E = (4.2e-1 Wb * 14 * 60 * 420 * 20) / (60 *42)

Wait, let me compute this step by step.

First, compute the numerator:

4.2e-1 *14 = 0.42 *14=5.88

5.88 *60=352.8

352.8 *420=148,224

148,224 *20=2,964,480

Denominator: 60 *42=2520

So E=2,964,480 /2520 ≈ 1176 V?

Wait, that seems high. Let me check the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Because 4.2e6 lines is 4.2e6 /1e8 = 0.042 Wb.

Wait, yes, because 1 Wb = 10^8 lines, so 4.2e6 lines = 4.2e6 /1e8 = 0.042 Wb.

So φ=0.042 Wb.

So let's recalculate:

Numerator: 0.042 *14 = 0.588

0.588 *60=35.28

35.28 *420=14,822.4

14,822.4 *20=296,448

Denominator: 60 *42=2520

E=296,448 /2520 ≈ 117.6 V.

Wait, that makes more sense. So 117.6 V.

But looking at the options, the first part (a) has 42 paths and part (ii) for (a) would be 117.6 V, but I don't see that in the options. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is E = (φ * P * N * Z * a) / (60 * A * p), where p is the number of parallel paths per pole. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula E = (φ * N * P * Z * a) / (60 * A).

Wait, let me try that again.

E = (0.042 Wb * 14 poles * 60 rpm * 420 coils * 20 turns) / (60 * 42 paths)

Wait, but 60 (rpm) and 60 in the denominator would cancel out.

So,

E = (0.042 *14 *60 *420 *20) / (60 *42)

The 60 in numerator and denominator cancel.

So,

E = (0.042 *14 *420 *20) /42

Compute step by step:

0.042 *14=0.588

0.588 *420=248.16

248.16 *20=4963.2

4963.2 /42=118.1714 V ≈ 118.17 V.

Hmm, but in the options, none of the part (i)(a) have 42 paths and part (ii) having ~118 V. Let me check the options again.

Looking at option F: 42 paths; 6 paths; 235.2 V; 1646.4 V.

Wait, but 235.2 V is for part (a), which is about double what I calculated. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, another formula I've come across is E = (φ * Z * N * P) / (60 * A) * a, where Z is the number of coils, but that would be E = (φ * Z * N * P * a) / (60 * A).

Wait, but in my calculation, I think I used that correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the number of conductors. Each coil has 20 turns, so total conductors is Z * a = 420 *20=8400 conductors.

In that case, the formula might be E = (φ * P * N * conductors) / (60 * A).

So E = (0.042 *14 *60 *8400) / (60 *42)

Simplify:

0.042 *14=0.588

0.588 *60=35.28

35.28 *8400=300, 35.28 *8400 = let's compute 35 *8400=294,000, plus 0.28*8400=2,352, total 296,352.

Divide by (60 *42)=2520.

296,352 /2520 = let's compute 296352 ÷ 2520.

Divide numerator and denominator by 12: 24696 / 210.

24696 ÷210= 117.6 V.

Same result as before. So 117.6 V, which is not matching any option for part (a).

Wait, but looking at option F, part (ii) for (a) is 235.2 V. That's exactly double my result. Did I miss a factor of 2 somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I forgot that each brush set contributes to two paths. Or perhaps the formula includes the number of parallel paths per pole differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of paths. Let me go back to part (i)(a).

In part (i)(a), it's a triplex lap-wound armature with 14 poles and 14 brush sets, each spanning three commutator bars.

Wait, in a lap winding, the number of parallel paths is equal to the number of poles multiplied by the number of parallel paths per pole. So for triplex, m=3, so A=14 *3=42. That seems correct.

But in the emf calculation, I'm getting 117.6 V, which isn't matching any option. The closest is option F, which has 235.2 V for part (a). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of conductors. Each coil has 20 turns, and there are 420 coils. So total conductors is 420 *20=8400. That's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the flux per pole is given in lines, so I should convert it to Webers correctly. 4.2e6 lines is 4.2e6 /1e8 =0.042 Wb, which is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the formula is different. Let me check another source. I think the correct formula for generated emf in a DC machine is:

E = (φ * Z * a * N * P) / (60 * A)

Where:
- φ = flux per pole (Wb),
- Z = number of coils,
- a = number of turns per coil,
- N = speed (rpm),
- P = number of poles,
- A = number of parallel paths.

So plugging in the numbers again:

φ=0.042 Wb,

Z=420,

a=20,

N=60,

P=14,

A=42.

E = (0.042 *420 *20 *60 *14) / (60 *42)

Simplify:

Calculate numerator: 0.042 *420=17.64,

17.64 *20=352.8,

352.8 *60=21168,

21168 *14=296,352.

Denominator: 60 *42=2520.

E=296352 /2520 ≈ 117.6 V.

Same result as before. So perhaps the options have a mistake, or I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula is E = (φ * P * N * Z * a) / (60 * A). That's what I used, and it's correct.

Hmm. Now, moving to part (i)(b), which is a triplex wave-wound armature with two brush sets and 14 poles.

So for part (i)(b), A is the number of parallel paths. Since it's a wave winding with two brush sets, I think the number of parallel paths A is equal to the number of brush sets, which is 2. So A=2.

Wait, but that would mean that each path has more coils in series. Let's proceed.

So for part (ii), using A=2.

E = (0.042 *14 *60 *420 *20) / (60 *2)

Simplify:

0.042 *14=0.588,

0.588 *60=35.28,

35.28 *420=14,822.4,

14,822.4 *20=296,448,

Denominator:60 *2=120.

E=296,448 /120=2,470.4 V.

But looking at the options, part (b) for E is in the range of 1,600 to 1,900 V. So 2,470 V is way higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the number of paths.

Wait, perhaps in part (b), the number of paths is 6. Because 14 poles and triplex wave, so A=3*14=42? No, that can't be because the number of brush sets is two.

Alternatively, perhaps in wave winding, the number of parallel paths is equal to the number of brush sets, which is two. So A=2.

But then the E calculation gives 2,470 V, which is not matching any options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of paths.

Wait, perhaps the number of paths in a wave winding is equal to the number of poles. So for P=14, A=14.

Then E = (0.042 *14 *60 *420 *20) / (60 *14)

Simplify:

0.042 *14=0.588,

0.588 *60=35.28,

35.28 *420=14,822.4,

14,822.4 *20=296,448,

Denominator:60 *14=840.

E=296,448 /840=353.08 V.

Hmm, that's still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of paths in a wave winding is equal to the number of brush sets multiplied by the number of parallel paths per pole. So with two brush sets and triplex (3 paths per pole), A=2*3=6.

So for part (i)(b), A=6.

Then E = (0.042 *14 *60 *420 *20) / (60 *6)

Calculate numerator: same as before, 296,448.

Denominator:60 *6=360.

E=296,448 /360=823.466 V.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in a wave winding, the number of paths is equal to the number of poles divided by the number of brush sets. So for 14 poles and 2 brush sets, A=14/2=7.

So A=7.

Then E = (0.042 *14 *60 *420 *20) / (60 *7)

Simplify:

0.042 *14=0.588,

0.588 *60=35.28,

35.28 *420=14,822.4,

14,822.4 *20=296,448,

Denominator:60 *7=420.

E=296,448 /420≈705.8 V.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me look at the options again.

Looking at option F: part (i)(a) has 42 paths and part (ii) for (a) is 235.2 V. How did they get that?

Let me try calculating E with A=42 and see if I get 235.2 V.

E = (0.042 *14 *60 *420 *20) / (60 *42)

Wait, let's compute this again.

0.042 *14=0.588,

0.588 *60=35.28,

35.28 *420=14,822.4,

14,822.4 *20=296,448,

Denominator:60 *42=2520.

E=296,448 /2520=117.6 V.

So 117.6 V, but option F says 235.2 V. So perhaps I missed a factor of 2.

Wait, perhaps the formula includes the number of poles in a different way. Let me check another formula.

Another formula I found is E = (φ * Z * a * N * P) / (60 * A)

Which is the same as what I used.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the number of paths in part (i)(b) is 6, leading to E=296,448 / (60*6)=296,448/360=823.466 V, which is not in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps part (i)(b) has A=7 paths, leading to E=705.8 V, which is still not in the options.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the option where part (i)(a) has 42 paths and part (ii) for (a) is 235.2 V.

Looking at option F: part (ii) for (a) is 235.2 V.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try again.

Wait, perhaps the formula is E = (φ * P * N * Z * a) / (60 * A * 2).

Wait, why would there be a factor of 2? Because in a lap winding, each path has two coils in series? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each brush set contributes two paths, so the number of paths is double the brush sets. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct number of paths for part (i)(b) is 6, which would give E=296,448/(60*6)=823.466 V. But that's not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the number of paths is 7, leading to E=705.8 V. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and should look for an option that has part (i)(a) as 42 paths and part (ii)(a) as approximately 235 V.

Wait, let me check option F: part (i)(a)=42, part (i)(b)=6, and part (ii) for (a)=235.2 V, which is exactly double my earlier calculation.

Hmm, perhaps I missed a factor of 2. Let me see where that could come from.

Wait, another formula I've seen is E = (φ * Z * a * N * P) / (60 * A * 2). Why 2? Because each path has two coils? Not sure.

Let me try that.

E = (0.042 *420 *20 *60 *14) / (60 *42 *2)

Calculate numerator: same as before, 296,352.

Denominator:60 *42 *2=5040.

E=296,352 /5040=58.8 V.

No, that's too low.

Alternatively, perhaps I should multiply by 2 somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps the formula is E = (φ * P * N * Z * a) / (60 * A) * 2.

So 117.6 *2=235.2 V, which matches option F.

But why would I multiply by 2? Maybe because each brush set contributes two paths. Or perhaps it's a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I used was incorrect, and the correct formula includes a factor of 2.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is E = (φ * P * N * Z * a) / (60 * A) * 2, leading to 235.2 V.

But I'm not sure why that factor of 2 would be there. Maybe because each path has two brushes, but that's not accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that the correct answer is option F, as it's the only one with part (i)(a) as 42 paths and part (ii)(a) as approximately double my initial calculation.

(i)(a) For a triplex lap-wound armature with 14 poles, the number of parallel paths is calculated as the number of poles multiplied by the number of paths per pole. Since it's a triplex winding, each pole contributes 3 paths. Therefore, the total number of paths is:

\[
A = P \times m = 14 \times 3 = 42 \text{ paths}.
\]

(i)(b) For a triplex wave-wound armature with 14 poles and 2 brush sets, the number of parallel paths is determined by the number of brush sets. Each brush set corresponds to one parallel path, so the total number of paths is:

\[
A = \text{number of brush sets} = 2 \text{ paths}.
\]

However, this contradicts the triplex nature, so reconsidering, the number of paths in a wave winding is typically equal to the number of poles divided by the number of brush sets. Thus:

\[
A = \frac{P}{\text{number of brush sets}} = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ paths}.
\]

But the options suggest a different approach, so the number of paths is taken as 6, aligning with the closest option.

(ii) The generated emf is calculated using the formula:

\[
E = \frac{\phi \cdot P \cdot N \cdot Z \cdot a}{60 \cdot A},
\]

where:
- \(\phi = 4.2 \times 10^6 \, \text{lines} = 0.042 \, \text{Wb}\),
- \(P = 14\),
- \(N = 60 \, \text{rpm}\),
- \(Z = 420\),
- \(a = 20\),
- \(A\) is the number of paths.

For part (i)(a) with \(A = 42\):

\[
E = \frac{0.042 \cdot 14 \cdot 60 \cdot 420 \cdot 20}{60 \cdot 42} = \frac{296,448}{2520} \approx 117.6 \, \text{V}.
\]

However, the closest option doubles this value, giving \(235.2 \, \text{V}\).

For part (i)(b) with \(A = 6\):

\[
E = \frac{0.042 \cdot 14 \cdot 60 \cdot 420 \cdot 20}{60 \cdot 6} = \frac{296,448}{360} \approx 823.466 \, \text{V}.
\]

But the closest option suggests \(1646.4 \, \text{V}\), indicating a discrepancy in the calculation.

Based on the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: F**
