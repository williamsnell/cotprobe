Question:

The Extruded Plastics Company distributes overhead to each of its six departments according to the ratio of total overhead to the total direct labor costs. During January, the total overhead for the factory was $20,000; the total direct labor cost $140,000. Find the ratio to be applied to all departments. Then find the amount to be charged to the Quality Control Department whose direct labor costs for the month were $16,000.

Options:

A: $5,000
B: $2,285.71
C: $4,000
D: $4,285.71

F: $1,142.86
G: $3,500
H: $1,000
I: $1,714.29
J: $2,857.14

Okay, so I've got this problem about distributing overhead costs in a company. Let me try to understand what's being asked here. The company uses a specific method to allocate overhead to each of its six departments. The method they're using is based on the ratio of total overhead to total direct labor costs. 

Alright, let's break down the numbers given. The total overhead for the factory in January was $20,000, and the total direct labor cost was $140,000. So, the first step is to find the ratio that will be applied to all departments. 

I think the ratio would be calculated by dividing the total overhead by the total direct labor costs. So, that would be $20,000 divided by $140,000. Let me do that calculation: 20,000 / 140,000. Hmm, that simplifies to 1/7, because 20,000 times 7 is 140,000. So the ratio is 1/7, which is approximately 0.142857.

Now, the next part is figuring out how much overhead to charge the Quality Control Department. They provided the direct labor costs for this department, which were $16,000. Since the overhead is distributed based on the ratio, I should multiply the department's direct labor cost by the ratio. 

So, that would be $16,000 multiplied by 1/7. Let me calculate that: 16,000 รท 7. Doing the division, 7 goes into 16 twice (14), remainder 2. Bring down the 0: 20 divided by 7 is 2, remainder 6. Next, 60 divided by 7 is 8 (56), remainder 4. Bring down the next 0: 40 divided by 7 is 5 (35), remainder 5. Bring down another 0: 50 divided by 7 is 7 (49), remainder 1. Bring down the next 0: 10 divided by 7 is 1, and so on. So, it's approximately 2,285.71.

Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The ratio is 20k/140k = 1/7, so 16k * 1/7 is indeed 16,000/7. Yep, that's correct. 

Looking at the options provided, option B is $2,285.71, which matches my calculation. So, that should be the correct answer.

The ratio is calculated as total overhead ($20,000) divided by total direct labor costs ($140,000), which equals 1/7. Applying this ratio to the Quality Control Department's direct labor costs ($16,000) gives $16,000 ร 1/7 = $2,285.71.

Answer: B
