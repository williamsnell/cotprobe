Okay, so I need to figure out the value of the Python expression 1 + 3 % 3. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my Python syntax, but I remember that the % operator is the modulus operator. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I should handle the modulus part because in Python, the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) means that multiplication and division (including modulus) are done before addition and subtraction. So, the expression 3 % 3 comes first.

Wait, what does 3 % 3 equal? I think the modulus operator gives the remainder after division. So when you divide 3 by 3, it goes exactly once with no remainder. So 3 % 3 should be 0, right?

Now, the expression becomes 1 + 0. Adding those together gives 1. So the result of the entire expression should be 1.

Looking at the options, D is 1, so that must be the correct answer. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up any steps. Oh yeah, because 3 divided by 3 is 1 with a remainder of 0, so modulus is 0. Adding 1 gives 1. Yep, that's correct.

The expression 1 + 3 % 3 evaluates to 1 because 3 % 3 is 0, and 1 + 0 equals 1.

Answer: D
