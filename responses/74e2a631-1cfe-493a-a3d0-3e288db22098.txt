Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the Supreme Court justices, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me go through each option one by one and think about what I know.

The question is asking about the majority of Supreme Court justices. So, I need to recall some facts about their backgrounds, appointments, and other characteristics.

Option A: have no prior judicial experience. Hmm, I think most Supreme Court justices do have some judicial experience. They usually come from lower courts or have been legal practitioners. So this might not be correct.

Option B: are appointed by presidents of the same political party. Wait, the president appoints them, but the Senate confirms. However, the majority are likely from the same party as the president who appointed them. Since presidents are usually of a particular party, this seems plausible. But wait, the majority of justices currently on the court are appointed by which presidents? I think that's true because each president tends to appoint people from their party, so the majority would align with that.

Option C: have previously served as Vice President. I don't think that's common. I can't recall any Supreme Court justice who was a VP before. Maybe someone was a VP and then a justice, but it's rare. So probably not the majority.

Option D: are appointed by the Senate. No, the Senate confirms appointments, but the president nominates. So D is incorrect.

Option E: are nominated by the Speaker of the House. No, the Speaker doesn't nominate; the president does. So E is wrong.

Option F: have a background in criminal law. I'm not sure. Some may, but I don't think it's the majority. They might come from various areas like constitutional law, but criminal law might not be the majority.

Option G: stay on the court for only a decade. I think justices serve until they die, retire, or are impeached. So they usually stay much longer than a decade. G is incorrect.

Option H: are required to have a degree in constitutional law. I think they need a law degree, but not necessarily in constitutional law. They might study general law or other areas. So H is probably wrong.

Option I: are required to retire at age 70. I don't think there's a mandatory retirement age for Supreme Court justices. They can serve until they choose to retire or until they're incapacitated. So I is incorrect.

Option J: switch party affiliation during their term. That seems unlikely. Once appointed, they usually stick with their party's views, but I don't think they switch parties. So J is probably wrong.

So, going back. The correct answer is likely B: are appointed by presidents of the same political party. Because each president, when appointing a justice, tends to choose someone from their own party, leading the majority of the current justices to have been appointed by presidents of the same party as the current president. Since the question is about the majority, and the current composition often reflects that, B makes sense.
