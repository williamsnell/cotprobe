Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the due date of a loan. The loan is made on December 17 and the time period is 120 days. I need to figure out when it's due, not considering leap years, so I don't have to worry about an extra day in February.

Hmm, let's think. A time period of 120 days needs to be broken down into months. Each month has a certain number of days. I remember that December has 31 days, so starting from December 17, adding 31 days would bring me to January 17 (since 17 +31=48, but wait, that might not be right because the days in each month vary). Wait, no, adding 31 days to December 17 would land on January 17 (since December 17 is day 1, plus 31 days is day 32, so day 32 is January 1). But wait, 31 days in December, so starting from December 17, adding 31 days would get us to January 17.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let's try another approach. Wait, perhaps I should count each month step by step.

Starting from December 17:

1. December has 31 days. So from Dec 17 to Dec 31 is 31 -17 = 14 days (since we're including Dec 17, wait no, wait. Wait, if it's 17th, then the next day is 18th. So 17th to 31st is 15 days. Because 31-17 =14? No, wait, 17th is day 1, 18th day 2, etc., up to 31st which is day 15. So 15 days from Dec 17 is Dec 31.

So adding 15 days brings us to Dec 31.

Now, 120 days total. 15 days used, so 105 left.

Next, January has 31 days. So adding 31 days to Dec 31 brings us into January. So 105-31=74. So Jan 31 would be day 32 (since 15+31=46, so Jan 1 is day 46. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, starting from Dec 17:

Dec 17 is day 0.

Day 1: Dec 18

...

Day 15: Dec 31.

So, 15 days used. Now, 120-15=105 days left.

January has 31 days. So adding 31 days: day 15 +31=46.

So, Jan 1 is day 46.

46 +31=77. So Jan 31 is day 77.

77 days used. 120-77=43 days left.

February has 28 days (not a leap year). Adding 28: 77+28=105. So Feb 28 is day 105.

105 days used. 120-105=15 days left.

March has 31 days. So adding 15 days: March 15 is day 105+15=120.

Wait, so the due date is March 15? But looking at the options, option I is March 17 and option G is April 17.

Wait, that can't be right because I thought it was March 15. Let me double-check.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me recount:

Start on Dec 17.

Dec 17: day 0.

Dec 18: day 1

Dec 19: day 2

...

Dec 31: day 15.

So 15 days to Dec 31.

120-15=105 days left.

January has 31 days. So adding 31 days to Dec 31 brings us to Jan 31. So day 15+31=46.

46 days used. 120-46=74 days left.

February: 28 days. 46+28=74. So Feb 28 is day 74.

74 days used. 120-74=46 days left.

March has 31 days. So adding 31: 74+31=105. So March 31 is day 105.

105 days used. 120-105=15 days left.

April has 30 days. So adding 15 days: April 15 is day 120.

Wait, so the due date is April 15, which is option A.

Wait, but let me check again. Let me add each step carefully.

Dec 17 is day 0.

Dec 18-31: 15 days (days 1-15). So Dec 31 is day 15.

15 days used. 105 remaining.

January: 31 days. So January 1 is day 16. So adding 31 days: day 31 is Jan 31 (day 46).

46 days used. 120-46=74.

February: 28 days. So Feb 28 is day 74. 74 used, 120-74=46.

March: 31 days. So March 31 is day 74+31=105. 105 used, 120-105=15.

April: 15 days. So April 15 is day 105+15=120. So due date is April 15.

So the answer should be option A: April 15.

To determine the due date of a $120-day loan starting on December 17 (not a leap year), we break down the months:

1. **From December 17 to December 31**: 15 days (Dec 18-31).
2. **After December 31**: Subtract 15 days, leaving 105 days.
3. **January has 31 days**: Add 31 days (Jan 1-31), totaling 46 days used.
4. **February has 28 days**: Add 28 days (Feb 1-28), totaling 74 days used.
5. **March has 31 days**: Add 31 days (Mar 1-Mar 31), totaling 105 days used.
6. **Remaining days**: Subtract 105 from 120, leaving 15 days.
7. **April has 30 days**: Add 15 days (Apr 1-Apr 15), totaling 120 days.

Thus, the due date is **April 15**.
