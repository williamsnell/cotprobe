Okay, so I have this probability question about rolling a die. The question is asking for the probability of getting either a 2 or a 5 in a single throw. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that a standard die has six faces, numbered from 1 to 6. Each face has an equal chance of landing face up, right? So the total number of possible outcomes when you throw the die is 6. That makes sense because you can only get one of those numbers each time.

Now, the problem is asking for the probability of getting either a 2 or a 5. So I need to figure out how many favorable outcomes there are for this event. Let's see, the favorable outcomes here are the numbers 2 and 5. That means there are two outcomes that we're interested in.

Probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So in this case, the favorable outcomes are 2 (which are 2 and 5), and the total possible outcomes are 6.

So the probability would be 2 divided by 6. Let me write that down: 2/6. Wait, can I simplify that fraction? Yeah, both numerator and denominator are divisible by 2. So 2 divided by 2 is 1, and 6 divided by 2 is 3. So that simplifies to 1/3.

Looking back at the options provided, I need to find which one matches 1/3. Let me check the options again. Option E is 1/3, so that must be the correct answer.

I should double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The die has six sides, and we're considering two favorable outcomes. So 2 out of 6 is indeed 1/3. Yep, that seems right. I don't think I missed anything here. The other options don't add up. For example, option A is 1/2, which would be if there were three favorable outcomes, but here we only have two. Option B is 2/3, which would be if there were four favorable outcomes, which isn't the case. So E is definitely the right choice.

The probability is calculated as 2 favorable outcomes (2 or 5) divided by 6 possible outcomes, which simplifies to 1/3.

Answer: E
