Okay, so I've got this problem here about a rectangle. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says that the length of the rectangle is twice its width. Hmm, right. So if I let the width be some variable, say 'w', then the length would be '2w'. That makes sense because the length is twice as long as the width.

Next, it says the diagonal of the rectangle is 5 times the square root of 5. Oh, I remember that in a rectangle, the diagonal forms a right triangle with the length and width. So I can use the Pythagorean theorem here. The theorem states that the square of the diagonal equals the sum of the squares of the length and width. 

Let me write that down. So diagonal squared equals length squared plus width squared. Plugging in the values I have: (5√5)² = (2w)² + w². Let me calculate each part. 

First, (5√5) squared. Hmm, 5 squared is 25, and (√5) squared is 5. So 25 times 5 is 125. So the left side is 125.

Now the right side: (2w) squared is 4w², and w squared is w². Adding them together gives 4w² + w², which is 5w². So now the equation is 125 = 5w². 

To solve for w², I can divide both sides by 5. That gives w² = 125 / 5 = 25. So w squared is 25. Taking the square root of both sides, w = 5. Wait, but width can't be negative, so w is 5 units.

Now, since the length is twice the width, length is 2*5 = 10 units. Now, the area of the rectangle is length multiplied by width. So that's 10 * 5 = 50 square units. 

Looking at the options, F is 50. So I think the answer is F.

The problem involves a rectangle where the length is twice the width. Let the width be \( w \), so the length is \( 2w \). Given the diagonal is \( 5\sqrt{5} \), we apply the Pythagorean theorem: \( (5\sqrt{5})^2 = (2w)^2 + w^2 \). Simplifying, \( 125 = 5w^2 \), leading to \( w = 5 \). The length is \( 10 \), and the area is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).

Answer: F
