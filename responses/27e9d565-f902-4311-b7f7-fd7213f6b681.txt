Question:

Three friends decided to go bowling together. They made a friendly wager on the match, with the winner receiving a free beer from the other two guys. In the second frame of the first game, the first friend apparently got a strike when he knocked down all 10 pins. However, the second friend accused the first friend of fouling because his foot went over the line. The first friend denied fouling and wanted to mark down a strike on the scorecard. The second friend refused to give the first friend a strike and wrote in a zero on the scoring sheet. The first friend became enraged. The second friend then went to bowl his frame. As the second friend turned his back, the first friend approached from behind with a bowling ball in his hand. The first friend then raised the bowling ball threatening to hit the back of the second friend's head. The second friend, who had his back turned, did not see the first friend's actions. The third friend saw what the first friend was about to do and could easily have warned the second friend; but the third friend remained silent. The first friend then struck the second friend on the back of the head with the bowling ball, causing a deep scalp wound. If the second friend asserts a cause of action against the third friend, he should

Options:

A: not prevail, because the third friend was under no duty to warn the second friend of the danger.
B: not prevail, as the third friend's silence does not qualify as an act of negligence.
C: prevail, because the third friend contributed to his injury by remaining silent.
D: prevail, because the third friend was aware of the danger.
E: prevail, because the third friend was an accomplice in the first friend's actions.
F: prevail, on account of the third friend's omission to act.
G: not prevail, because the first friend was responsible for his injury.
H: prevail, because the third friend had a moral obligation to warn him.
I: not prevail, because the third friend could not have predicted the first friend's actions.
J: not prevail, because the third friend did not directly cause the injury.

Okay, so I've got this tort law question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read through it carefully.

So, there are three friends bowling. They bet that the winner gets a free beer from the others. In the second frame, the first friend gets a strike. The second friend accuses him of fouling because his foot went over the line. The first friend denies it and wants to mark a strike. Second friend writes a zero instead. Then the first friend gets angry. The second friend goes to bowl his frame, turns his back, and the first friend approaches from behind with a bowling ball, raises it to hit the back of his head. The third friend saw this and could have warned the second friend but stayed silent. The first friend hits the second friend, causing a scalp wound.

Now, the question is, if the second friend sues the third friend, what should happen?

Options are A to J. I need to figure out the cause of action against the third friend.

First, I should think about tort law principles, specifically negligence. For negligence, the plaintiff (second friend) needs to show that the third friend (defendant) owed him a duty of care, breached that duty, which caused his injury, and resulted in damages.

So, did the third friend have a duty to warn? Well, the third friend saw that the first friend was about to attack the second friend. He could have warned him but didn't. But does that create a duty?

I remember that in some cases, when someone is in a position to warn another of an imminent danger, there might be a duty. But it's not always clear. For example, if you're a bystander and see someone in danger, do you have a duty to act? Generally, no. There's a concept called "duty to rescue," but most jurisdictions don't require people to act unless there's a special relationship, like parent-child or employer-employee.

In this case, the third friend is just another friend, no special relationship. So, maybe there's no legal duty to warn. But what about the "Good Samaritan" laws? Those usually protect people who help others from liability, but they don't create a duty to act.

Another angle is whether the third friend's inaction contributed to the injury. If he had warned, the second friend might have avoided the attack. But without a duty, his failure to act isn't a breach of duty. So, without a duty, there's no negligence.

Looking at the options:

A: Third friend had no duty to warn. That seems correct because, as a bystander, there's no general duty to warn others of dangers unless they're in a special relationship.

B: Silence isn't negligence. This is also a point because not acting isn't necessarily a breach unless there's a duty. But if there's no duty, then yes, silence doesn't make it negligence.

C: Prevail because silence contributed. But without a duty, the contribution doesn't matter.

D: Prevail because he knew the danger. Again, knowing doesn't create a duty if there's no relationship.

E: Accomplice. That's more about criminal law, aiding and abetting. In tort, it's about negligence, not criminal intent.

F: Omission to act. But again, duty is key. If no duty, omission isn't negligent.

G: Not prevail because first friend is responsible. That's about causation. The third friend's inaction didn't cause the injury because the first friend did the act. But the issue is whether the third had a duty, not just who caused the injury.

H: Moral obligation. But moral obligations don't create legal duties unless there's a specific rule.

I: Couldn't predict. That's about foreseeability. But the third friend could predict because he saw it happening.

J: Not prevail because no direct cause. That's more about causation. The third friend's omission was not the direct cause; the first friend's act was. But if the third had a duty, his omission could be a proximate cause.

Wait, but in terms of negligence, the key is duty. If there's no duty, then the third friend isn't liable. So options A and B are about the absence of duty. Option A says no duty, so he doesn't prevail. Option B says silence isn't an act, but if there's a duty, then silence could be a breach.

So the main issue is whether the third friend owed a duty. Since they were just friends, not in a special relationship, the third friend likely had no duty to warn. Therefore, the second friend can't prevail against the third friend.

Looking at the options, A says the third friend was under no duty to warn. That seems correct. B says silence isn't negligence, which is also correct, but only if there's no duty. So both A and B are correct in their reasoning, but A directly addresses the duty issue.

Wait, in some cases, if someone creates a dangerous situation, they might have a duty to warn others. But here, the third friend didn't create the danger; the first friend did. The third friend was a witness. So I think A is the better answer because there's no duty.

The key issue is whether the third friend owed a duty to warn the second friend of the imminent danger. Since the third friend was not in a special relationship with the second friend, there is no legal duty to warn. Therefore, the second friend cannot prevail against the third friend.
