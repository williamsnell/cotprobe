Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about what type of inflation a government would target by raising taxes on disposable income. The options are A through J, each representing a different type of inflation. Hmm, I remember that taxes can affect the economy in various ways, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics here.

First, I need to recall what each type of inflation means. Let's go through them one by one. Built-in inflation refers to the expectation of inflation that becomes part of price and wage setting. Asset inflation is when asset prices, like real estate or stocks, rise rapidly. Monetary inflation is when there's an increase in the money supply leading to higher prices. Wage inflation is when wages increase faster than productivity, which can drive up prices. Cost-push inflation is when production costs rise, leading to higher prices. Stagflation is a combination of stagnant economic growth and high inflation. Demand-pull inflation happens when demand exceeds supply, driving prices up. Hyperinflation is an extreme case of rapidly increasing prices. Imported inflation is when inflation is caused by rising prices of imported goods. Deflation is the opposite of inflation, where prices fall.

Now, the question is about raising taxes on disposable income to combat inflation. Disposable income is the money people have left after taxes to spend on goods and services. If the government raises taxes on that, people would have less money to spend. So, what effect does that have on the economy?

I think this would reduce the overall demand in the economy because people have less disposable income. Reduced demand can lead to lower prices, which would help control inflation. But which type of inflation is this targeting?

Looking at the options, demand-pull inflation is when too much money chases too few goods, causing prices to rise. By reducing disposable income, the government is decreasing the money available for spending, which should lower demand and thus combat demand-pull inflation. So, option G seems right.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing things up. Wage inflation is when wages go up, but that's more about the cost side. Monetary inflation is about the money supply, which is usually addressed by monetary policy, not fiscal like taxes. Cost-push inflation is when costs to produce goods go up, like higher oil prices, which isn't directly addressed by this tax measure. Imported inflation is external, so raising taxes wouldn't directly affect that. Built-in inflation is about expectations, which is more psychological.

So, yeah, raising taxes on disposable income would reduce consumer spending, targeting demand-pull inflation. That makes sense because demand-pull is about too much demand, so reducing it would lower prices.

The government's action of raising taxes on disposable income reduces the amount of money people have to spend, thereby decreasing overall demand in the economy. This strategy is particularly effective against demand-pull inflation, where excess demand leads to rising prices. By lowering demand, the government aims to stabilize prices and control inflation.
