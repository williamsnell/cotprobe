Okay, let me try to work through this physics problem. So the question is about the motion of a real object in free fall, considering that it experiences a drag force proportional to its speed. Also, the object strikes the ground before reaching terminal speed. I need to pick the correct description from options A to J.

Hmm, I remember that when objects fall under gravity, they accelerate until they reach terminal velocity. But wait, this question says the object hits the ground before reaching terminal speed. So maybe it doesn't have time to reach that point.

Terminal velocity is when the gravitational force is balanced by the drag force, so the net acceleration is zero. But in this case, the object doesn't reach that point because it stops when it hits the ground. So what happens during its fall?

Let me think about the forces. The object experiences gravitational force pulling it down, which is mg, and a drag force upwards proportional to speed, which would be something like bv or kv, where v is velocity. 

At the start, when the object is released, its speed is zero. So the drag force is zero, and the net force is mg, leading to acceleration g. As it speeds up, the drag force increases. The net acceleration would then decrease because the drag is opposing the motion.

Eventually, if it weren't for hitting the ground, it would reach terminal velocity where mg equals bv. But since it hits the ground before that, it's still accelerating, but the acceleration is decreasing over time.

Wait, but does the speed increase until impact? Yes, because even though acceleration is decreasing, it's still positive. So the object's speed is increasing, but the rate at which it's increasing (acceleration) is going down.

So looking at the options, let me see which one matches this. The object's speed is increasing, and the acceleration is decreasing. So which option says that?

Option E: Increasing speed and decreasing acceleration. That fits. Oh wait, let me check the options again.

Looking back, the options are labeled A to J. So option E is "It will fall with increasing speed and decreasing acceleration." That sounds correct. 

Wait, but another thought: when the speed increases, the drag increases. So the net acceleration is (mg - bv)/m. As v increases, the net acceleration decreases. So the object is still speeding up, but each moment's acceleration is less than the previous. So yes, speed is increasing and acceleration is decreasing.

So the correct answer should be E.

The object falls under the influence of gravity and drag force proportional to speed. Initially, the drag force is negligible, leading to maximum acceleration (equal to g). As the object gains speed, the drag force increases, reducing the net acceleration. Since the object strikes the ground before reaching terminal velocity, its speed continues to increase, but the acceleration decreases over time. This matches the description in option E.

Answer: E
