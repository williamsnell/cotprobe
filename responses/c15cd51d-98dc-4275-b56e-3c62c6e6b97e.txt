Okay, so I have this question about the weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) for a company called Merritt Co. Hmm, WACC is a concept I remember from finance class, right? It's the average rate a company is expected to pay to all its security holders to finance its assets. The formula involves the cost of each capital component, weighted by its proportion in the total capital structure. 

Wait, the question gives me the capital structure as 20% common equity and 80% debt. So that makes sense because debt is usually cheaper than equity, so companies often have more debt in their structure to minimize costs. 

The cost of common equity is 10%, which is pretty high. The pretax cost of debt is 5%, which is lower, as expected. The tax rate is 21%, which I think is important because interest on debt is tax-deductible. So I should remember to adjust the cost of debt after tax.

Let me jot down the given data:

- Weight of common equity (We) = 20% or 0.20
- Weight of debt (Wd) = 80% or 0.80
- Cost of common equity (Re) = 10% or 0.10
- Cost of debt (Rd) = 5% or 0.05
- Tax rate (Tc) = 21% or 0.21

The formula for WACC is:

WACC = (We * Re) + (Wd * Rd * (1 - Tc))

So plugging in the numbers:

First, calculate each part. 

For the equity part: We * Re = 0.20 * 0.10 = 0.02 or 2%.

For the debt part: Wd * Rd * (1 - Tc) = 0.80 * 0.05 * (1 - 0.21). Let me compute the tax factor first. 1 - 0.21 is 0.79. So then 0.80 * 0.05 is 0.04, and then 0.04 * 0.79. Let me calculate that: 0.04 * 0.79 is 0.0316 or 3.16%.

Now add both parts together: 2% + 3.16% = 5.16%.

Wait, that seems low. I thought WACC is usually higher because equity is more expensive. But looking at the weights, the company has a lot of debt (80%) which is cheaper, so maybe that brings the WACC down.

Looking at the options, option A is 5.16%, which matches my calculation. But wait, let me double-check the formula to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Yes, the formula is correct. WACC is the sum of the cost of each component multiplied by their respective weights, with the debt cost adjusted for tax. So yes, 5.16% is the correct WACC.

But another thought: sometimes, if the company has other components like preferred equity, but in this case, it's just common equity and debt. So I think I didn't miss anything.

So the answer should be option A.

The weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) is calculated using the formula:

WACC = (We * Re) + (Wd * Rd * (1 - Tc))

Given the data:
- We = 20% (0.20)
- Wd = 80% (0.80)
- Re = 10% (0.10)
- Rd = 5% (0.05)
- Tc = 21% (0.21)

Calculations:
- Equity cost: 0.20 * 0.10 = 2%
- Debt cost after tax: 0.80 * 0.05 * (1 - 0.21) = 0.80 * 0.05 * 0.79 = 3.16%

Adding both parts: 2% + 3.16% = 5.16%

Answer: A
