The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

At a defendant's trial for burglary, the defendant has called a witness who has testified without objection that the defendant said shortly after his arrest, "They've got the wrong person for this, because I have an alibi." The prosecutor seeks to cross- examine the witness about why she did not mention that statement when the police asked her whether the defendant had said anything to her about having an alibi. Is the prosecutor's proposed cross-examination proper?

Options:

A: Yes, as a way to establish the witness's relationship with the defendant.
B: No, because the prosecutor cannot introduce evidence that contradicts the defendant's statement.
C: Yes, as a method to challenge the witness's credibility.
D: No, because the witness's failure to mention the alibi is not relevant.
E: Yes, as a way to question the witness's memory.
F: No, because the prosecutor cannot cross-examine the defendant's witness.
G: Yes, as impeachment for prior inconsistency.
H: No, because the witness's failure to mention the alibi is collateral and ambiguous.
I: Yes, as impeachment for bias and interest.
J: No, because the witness's character for truthfulness cannot be attacked by specific instances of conduct.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with cross-examination. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is a burglary trial. The defendant called a witness who testified without objection that the defendant said, shortly after arrest, "They've got the wrong person for this, because I have an alibi." Now, the prosecutor wants to cross-examine the witness about why she didn't mention that statement when the police asked her if the defendant said anything about an alibi.

The question is whether this cross-examination is proper. The options are A through J.

First, I need to recall some evidence rules, particularly about cross-examination and impeachment of witnesses. I remember that generally, a witness can be impeached if they have given inconsistent statements. Also, when a witness is asked a question and doesn't volunteer information, the examiner can bring up omissions, especially if those omissions are material.

In this case, the witness testified about the defendant's statement, which is an exculpatory statement. When the police asked her about anything the defendant said, she didn't mention this alibi statement. The prosecutor is trying to bring that up in cross.

I think about the rules of cross-examination. The prosecutor is allowed to ask the witness why she didn't mention the alibi when questioned by the police. This could go to the witness's credibility. If the witness failed to mention a key point when given the chance, it might suggest she's not being truthful or she had a motive to omit it.

Wait, but isn't there a rule about prior inconsistent statements? Oh right, if a witness's prior statement is inconsistent with their testimony, it can be used to impeach them. But in this case, the witness is recounting a statement made by the defendant, not her own. So it's not her prior statement, but the defendant's. So maybe that's not about prior inconsistency.

Alternatively, the issue is whether the omission is relevant. The witness was asked by the police about anything the defendant said, and she didn't mention the alibi. The omission could suggest she's not being truthful or maybe she's biased. So the prosecutor is questioning her about that omission to challenge her credibility.

Looking at the options, option C says yes, as a method to challenge the witness's credibility. That seems plausible. Another option is G, which is about prior inconsistency, but I don't think that's applicable here because it's not the witness's prior statement.

Option H says no because it's collateral and ambiguous. Wait, collateral evidence is generally not admissible unless it goes to the witness's credibility. But here, the omission could be relevant because it might show that the witness is not telling the truth or is hiding something.

Option D says no because the failure to mention is not relevant. But if the witness was given the chance to report the defendant's statement and didn't, that seems relevant to her credibility.

Option J relates to attacking the witness's character, but the question is about whether the omission is proper, not about her character for truthfulness. So J might not be the right choice here.

So, putting it together, the cross-examination is proper because it challenges the witness's credibility by pointing out her omission, suggesting she might be lying or hiding something. So the answer should be C.

The prosecutor's proposed cross-examination is proper because it challenges the witness's credibility by highlighting her omission of the defendant's statement when questioned by the police. This omission suggests potential untruthfulness or bias, making it relevant to her credibility.

Answer: C
