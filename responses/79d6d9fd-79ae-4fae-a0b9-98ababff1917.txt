Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this memory question. Let's see what it's about. The question is about comparing older adults' memory for recent events versus events that happened a long time ago. The problem is that recent events... something. The options are A through J.

Hmm, I remember that older adults often have better memory for events from the distant past, like the golden age effect. So, when they remember recent events, maybe there's an issue there. Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A: Can be verified while older events often cannot. I'm not sure. Maybe recent events are easier to check because they're more recent, but older events might not have the same verification. But does that cause a problem in comparison? Maybe, but I'm not certain.

Option B: Are influenced by current mental state. That makes sense. Recent events are more vulnerable to current emotions or mental health because they're closer in time. Older events are more stable because they're set in the past. So this could be a problem when comparing because recent memories might be colored by now.

Option C: May be very well rehearsed. I'm thinking of how rehearsal affects memory. Maybe older adults have rehearsed distant events more, so they're more fixed. But recent events might not have had as much time to be rehearsed. Not sure if this is the main issue.

Option D: Are more likely to be distorted or embellished. I think that with time, memories can change, so older events might be more prone to distortion. But recent events, being closer, might be more accurate. Wait, but if someone is older, maybe their current mental state affects how they remember recent events, making them more distorted. Hmm, possible.

Option E: Are often less significant than older events. Maybe, but I don't think that's the main issue in comparing memory accuracy. The significance might affect how well they're remembered, but the question is about the problem in comparison.

Option F: Have a different emotional impact. Emotion can influence memory, but I'm not sure how that directly affects the comparison of recent vs. distant events in older adults.

Option G: Have no denominator to help in computing an average. That sounds more like a math or statistics term, not related to memory problems. Probably not the right answer.

Option H: Can be easily confused with older events. Maybe, but I think this is more about the content of the memories rather than the problem in comparing them.

Option I: Are more likely to be forgotten. That could be true, but older adults might forget recent events more, which would make comparing them a problem. But I'm not sure if that's the main issue.

Option J: Are far more meaningful. Similar to E, but again, not directly about the problem in comparison.

So, focusing back on the main issue: the problem in comparing recent and older memories. The key point is that recent events are more influenced by current mental states. For example, someone's current mood, stress, or other factors could affect how they remember recent events, making those memories less reliable compared to older, more stable memories. So Option B seems like the best fit.

The problem in comparing older adults' memory for recent events and distant events is that recent events are more influenced by the current mental state, making them less reliable for comparison. 

Answer: B
