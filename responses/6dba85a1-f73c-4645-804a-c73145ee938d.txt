Okay, so I have this question about how many states in the international system are likely to have nuclear weapons right now. The options are from A to J, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that nuclear weapons are a big deal and only a few countries have them. Let me think about the countries that are known to have nuclear weapons. The ones I know for sure are the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, and France. Those are the five permanent members of the UN Security Council who openly declare having nukes.

Then there are a few more countries that are believed to have them, though they might not officially declare it. I think India and Pakistan are two of them. They've had a lot of tension between them, so it makes sense they'd have nukes. Israel is another one; they've never officially said they have them, but there's a lot of evidence pointing that way.

North Korea is another country that comes to mind. They've been making a lot of headlines with their nuclear tests and missile launches. So that's another one.

Wait, so that's the US, Russia, China, UK, France, India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea. That's nine countries. Hmm, but wait, I thought someone mentioned that the exact number is around nine or ten. Let me think again.

Oh, right, maybe I missed one. I think there's also a country that's a declared nuclear state but might be part of the list. Oh, wait, no, I think I got all the major ones. So that's nine. But wait, I've heard some sources say that there are eight or nine countries with nuclear weapons.

Wait, let me recount: US, Russia, China, UK, France, India, Pakistan, Israel, North Korea. That's nine. So the count is nine. Now, looking at the options:

A: More than 25 – No, that's way too high.
B: Between 16 and 25 – Still too high.
C: More than 100 – No way.
D: Exactly 7 – Hmm, I thought it was more than that.
E: Between 36 and 50 – No.
F: Fewer than 7 – So 6 or fewer. I think it's more than that.
G: Between 50 and 100 – No.
H: Between 8 and 15 – So 9 would fall into this range.
I: Between 26 and 35 – No.
J: Exactly 15 – No.

Wait, I thought I had nine, but maybe I'm overcounting. Let me double-check. US, Russia, China, UK, France, India, Pakistan, Israel, North Korea – that's nine. But some sources say that the exact number is nine, but sometimes it's reported as eight because Israel doesn't officially admit it. So depending on whether we count Israel, it could be eight or nine. But I think most analyses include Israel, so nine.

Wait, but the options don't have exactly nine. Let me look again. Option H is between 8 and 15, so 8-15. So nine would fit into H. But I thought some sources say it's eight. So maybe the correct answer is H. Alternatively, some sources might say it's exactly 9, but the options don't have that. So the closest is H.

Wait, but the exact number is actually nine. So the options don't have exactly nine, so I have to choose between H or maybe D is exactly 7, which I think is too low. So H is 8-15, which includes 9. So the answer would be H.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the exact number is nine, but sometimes it's said to be eight if Israel isn't counted. So maybe the correct answer is H: Between 8 and 15. Because depending on whether you count Israel, it's 8 or 9, so it's within that range.

Alternatively, if the question is about "likely" to have, maybe there are more countries that are suspected but not confirmed. But I think the main ones are the nine I listed. So I think the correct answer is H: Between 8 and 15.

The international system currently has a limited number of states with nuclear weapons. The widely recognized nuclear states include the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, and France. Additionally, India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea are known or believed to possess nuclear weapons. Depending on whether Israel is counted, the total ranges from 8 to 9. Since the exact number is not listed as an option, the closest range provided is between 8 and 15.

Answer: H
