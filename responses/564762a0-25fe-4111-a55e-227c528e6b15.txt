Okay, so I've got this psychology question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about a man who witnessed his wife and children being killed by a speeding truck as they crossed the street. However, he has no memory of the event and gets upset when people tell him he must remember. The question is asking what disorder he's most likely suffering from, with options from A to J.

Alright, let's break this down. The key points are that he experienced a traumatic event (seeing his family killed), he has no memory of it, and he gets upset when reminded about it. So, I'm thinking this has to do with trauma and memory loss.

Looking at the options:

A: Major depressive disorder – This is about persistent sadness and loss of interest, but I'm not sure if it's directly related to trauma and memory loss.

B: Antisocial personality disorder – This involves a long-term pattern of disregard for others, which doesn't seem to fit here.

C: Bipolar disorder – This is about mood swings, so probably not the case.

D: Dissociative amnesia – This disorder involves memory loss, usually after a trauma, where the person can't remember important personal information. It seems relevant because the man can't remember the event.

E: Conversion disorder – This is a type of somatic symptom disorder where psychological stress causes physical symptoms. Not sure if it fits here.

F: Obsessive-compulsive disorder – Involves repetitive thoughts and behaviors, which doesn't seem to match.

G: Schizophrenia – A psychotic disorder, which isn't indicated here.

H: Generalized anxiety disorder – Chronic anxiety, not directly related to trauma-induced memory loss.

I: Post-traumatic stress disorder – This involves re-experiencing the trauma, like flashbacks, which is more about remembering rather than forgetting.

J: Panic disorder – Focused on panic attacks, which isn't the issue here.

Wait, but wait a second. I thought dissociative amnesia is when someone forgets a specific traumatic event, which aligns with the man's inability to remember. PTSD, on the other hand, is more about the inability to forget or recurring memories.

So, the man can't remember the event, which suggests dissociative amnesia. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes dissociative amnesia is about forgetting identity or personal history, not just a specific event. However, the question specifies he has no memory of the event, so D might be the answer.

Alternatively, could it be dissociative identity disorder? But that's not one of the options here. The options given don't include that, so D is the closest.

Another thought: Conversion disorder (E) might involve memory loss, but it's more about physical symptoms. Dissociative amnesia is specifically about memory loss without other dissociative symptoms.

So, putting it all together, the most likely answer is D: dissociative amnesia.

The man's inability to remember the traumatic event and his distress when reminded of it points to dissociative amnesia, where memory loss follows trauma. 

Answer: D
