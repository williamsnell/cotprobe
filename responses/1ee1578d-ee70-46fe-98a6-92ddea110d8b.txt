Okay, so I need to figure out how much it'll cost to cover the kitchen floor with linoleum. The floor dimensions are 7'6" by 11'8". Linoleum sells for $1.79 per running foot in 6' width. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I should convert the measurements into just feet because the price is given per foot. 7'6" is 7 feet plus 6 inches. Since 12 inches make a foot, 6 inches is half a foot, which is 0.5. So 7'6" is 7.5 feet. Similarly, 11'8" is 11 feet plus 8 inches. 8 inches is 8/12, which is approximately 0.6667 feet. So 11.6667 feet total. Now the floor is 7.5 ft by 11.6667 ft.

Next, I need to calculate the area of the floor. Area is length multiplied by width. So 7.5 * 11.6667. Let me compute that. 7 * 11 is 77, 7 * 0.6667 is about 4.6669, 0.5 * 11 is 5.5, and 0.5 * 0.6667 is about 0.3333. Adding all together: 77 + 4.6669 +5.5 +0.3333 = 87.5. So the area is approximately 87.5 square feet.

But wait, linoleum is sold in 6' width rolls. So each strip is 6 feet wide. I need to figure out how much length of this 6' wide roll I need to cover the floor area.

The area of the floor is 87.5 sq ft. Since each strip is 6' wide, the length needed would be total area divided by width. So 87.5 / 6 = approximately 14.5833 feet. So I need about 14.5833 linear feet of the 6' wide linoleum.

Now, the cost per running foot is $1.79. So total cost would be 14.5833 * 1.79. Let me calculate that. 14 * 1.79 is 25.06, and 0.5833 * 1.79 is approximately 1.044. Adding them together gives about 26.104 dollars. Looking at the options, option B is $26.85, which is close but a bit higher. Maybe I should check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation. Let me recalculate the area more accurately. 7.5 ft multiplied by 11.6667 ft. Let me do this precisely: 7.5 * 11.6667. 7.5 * 11 is 82.5, and 7.5 * 0.6667 is about 5. So total is 87.5 sq ft. That seems correct.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the linoleum is sold per running foot in 6' width, but perhaps the way the roll is cut affects the calculation. For example, if the floor is 11'8" long and 7'6" wide, and the linoleum is 6' wide, maybe I can cover the 7'6" width by using the 6' width of the linoleum. So the length needed would be 11'8" plus any waste.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of how many strips I need. Since the floor is 7'6" wide (7.5 ft) and the linoleum is 6 ft wide, I can lay one strip along the 11'8" length, but 6 ft isn't enough to cover the 7.5 ft width. So I might need two strips: one 6 ft wide and another 1.5 ft wide. But wait, linoleum is sold in 6' width, so maybe I can't buy a partial width. So perhaps I need to cover the entire width with the 6' roll.

Wait, no, the roll is 6' wide. So each strip is 6' wide, and the length is as needed. So to cover the 7'6" (7.5 ft) width, I need to lay the 6' wide strips across the 7.5 ft width. So the length of each strip would be the length of the room, which is 11'8" (11.6667 ft). But wait, the 6' width is the width of the roll, so each strip would be 6' wide and 11.6667' long. But the room is 7.5' wide, which is less than 6'? No, wait, 7.5' is more than 6', so perhaps I need to cut the roll to fit.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me visualize this. The room is 7.5' wide and 11.6667' long. The linoleum is sold as 6' wide. So each strip is 6' wide and can be cut to the required length. So to cover the 7.5' width, I can lay one strip of 6' wide and another strip of 1.5' wide. But since the linoleum is only sold in 6' width, I can't buy 1.5' width. So perhaps I need to buy two strips: one 6' wide and another 6' wide, but only use part of the second one.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the linoleum is 6' wide, so the length needed would be the room's length, and the width of the roll is 6', but the room's width is 7.5', which is more than 6'. So I would need to have two strips: one 6' wide and another 1.5' wide, but since I can't buy 1.5', I have to buy another 6' strip and cut off the extra 4.5' (since 6' - 1.5' = 4.5'). But that would be wasteful and more expensive.

Alternatively, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps I should calculate the total area and then figure out how much linoleum I need in linear feet.

Total area: 7.5 * 11.6667 = 87.5 sq ft.

Each strip is 6' wide, so each linear foot of the strip covers 6 sq ft. Therefore, the number of linear feet needed is total area divided by 6. So 87.5 /6 ≈14.5833 linear feet. So I need approximately 14.5833 linear feet.

But since you can't buy a fraction of a foot, you have to round up. So 14.5833 rounds up to 14.5833, which is about 14.5833. Wait, but in reality, you can't buy a fraction, so perhaps you need to buy 15 linear feet. But maybe the store allows you to buy partials, but the problem states it's sold per running foot, so perhaps it's $1.79 per foot, and you can buy as much as you need. So 14.5833 *1.79.

Let me calculate that precisely. 14.5833 *1.79.

First, 14 *1.79 = 25.06.

0.5833 *1.79: 0.5 *1.79=0.895, 0.0833*1.79≈0.149. So total is approximately 0.895 +0.149=1.044.

Adding to 25.06 gives 26.104. So approximately $26.10. Looking at the options, option B is $26.85, which is close but a bit higher. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the roll is 6' wide, so when you buy 14.5833 linear feet, it's 6' wide. So the area is 14.5833 *6 =87.5 sq ft, which matches the floor area. So the cost is 14.5833 *1.79=26.104. So approximately $26.10. The closest option is B: $26.85, but that's higher. Alternatively, perhaps I should round up to 14.59 or 14.6.

Wait, 14.5833 is about 14.5833. Let me compute 14.5833 *1.79 more accurately.

14 *1.79 = 25.06

0.5833 *1.79:

0.5 *1.79=0.895

0.08 *1.79=0.1432

0.0033*1.79≈0.0059

Adding: 0.895 +0.1432=1.0382 +0.0059≈1.0441.

So total is 25.06 +1.0441=26.1041, which is approximately $26.10.

Looking at the options, B is $26.85, which is higher. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the answer expects us to round up to the next whole foot, so 15 linear feet, which would be 15*1.79=26.85. That would make option B correct.

So perhaps the answer is B: $26.85.

To determine the cost of covering the kitchen floor with linoleum, first calculate the floor area:  
7'6" (7.5 ft) × 11'8" (11.6667 ft) = 87.5 sq ft.

Each strip of linoleum is 6' wide, so the length needed is:  
87.5 sq ft ÷ 6' = 14.5833 linear feet.

The cost per running foot is $1.79, so the total cost is:  
14.5833 × $1.79 ≈ $26.10.  

Since linoleum is typically purchased in whole feet, rounding up to 15 linear feet gives:  
15 × $1.79 = $26.85.
