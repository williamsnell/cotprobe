Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: If f(x) equals 2 for all real numbers x, what is the value of f(x + 2)? The options are A through J, with various answers.

Hmm, so f(x) is a function that's always equal to 2, no matter what x is. That means, for any input x, the output is 2. So, for example, f(0) is 2, f(1) is 2, f(-5) is 2, and so on.

Now, the question is asking about f(x + 2). So, instead of plugging in x into the function, we're plugging in x + 2. But wait, since f(x) is always 2 regardless of the input, does that mean f(x + 2) will also be 2? Because it doesn't matter what the input is; the function just spits out 2 every time.

Let me think about functions for a moment. A function f(x) = c, where c is a constant, is called a constant function. That means no matter what x is, the output remains the same. So if I change the input from x to x + 2, it's still just another input, but since the function is constant, the output won't change.

To put it another way, if I shift the input by 2 units (like adding 2 to x), the function's value doesn't depend on the input at all. So f(x + 2) is the same as f(x), which is 2.

Looking at the options, option I is 2, which matches what I'm thinking. Let me just double-check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something.

Option A is 0. That doesn't make sense because the function is always 2, so why would it suddenly be 0 when the input is shifted?

Option B is x squared plus 2. That would imply the function is quadratic, which it's not. The function is constant, so this option is out.

Option C is 4. Hmm, why would it be 4? Maybe if someone thought that adding 2 to x would somehow double the function's value? But no, the function doesn't depend on x, so adding 2 doesn't change anything.

Option D is 2x. That would be the case if f(x) was 2 times x, but here f(x) is just 2, so this isn't right.

Option E is x + 2, which is similar to D but without the multiplication by 2. Still, the function doesn't depend on x, so this can't be correct.

Option F is undefined. Well, the function is defined for all real numbers, so f(x + 2) is definitely defined, not undefined.

Option G is 1, which is just another number, but again, the function doesn't change based on the input. So 1 isn't the answer.

Option H is 2x + 2. That would be if the function was linear, like 2x + 2, but here it's a constant function.

Option J is 4x, which is similar to D but with a different coefficient. Again, the function isn't dependent on x, so this isn't right.

So after going through each option, I'm pretty confident that the correct answer is I: 2.

The function f(x) is a constant function equal to 2 for all real numbers x. Therefore, f(x + 2) is also 2, regardless of the shift in the input. 

Answer: I
