Okay, so I've got this problem where a couple has six children with ages 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16. I need to find the variance in their ages. Hmm, variance measures how spread out the numbers are, right? I remember from my stats class that variance is calculated by taking the average of the squared differences from the mean. So, first, I should probably find the mean of these ages.

Let me list out the ages: 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16. There are six numbers. To find the mean, I'll add them all up and divide by 6. Let me do the addition step by step.

6 + 8 is 14. Then, 14 + 10 is 24. Next, 24 + 12 is 36. Adding 14 to that gives 50, and then adding 16 brings the total to 66. So, the sum is 66. Now, divide 66 by 6 to get the mean. That's 11. So the mean age is 11.

Next step is to find the squared differences from the mean for each age. Let me go through each one.

For the first age, 6: subtract the mean (11) to get 6-11 = -5. Then square that: (-5)^2 = 25.

Second age is 8: 8-11 = -3. Squared is 9.

Third age, 10: 10-11 = -1. Squared is 1.

Fourth age, 12: 12-11 = 1. Squared is 1.

Fifth age, 14: 14-11 = 3. Squared is 9.

Sixth age, 16: 16-11 = 5. Squared is 25.

Now I have all the squared differences: 25, 9, 1, 1, 9, 25. I need to find the average of these. So, add them all up first.

25 + 9 is 34. 34 +1 is 35. 35 +1 is 36. 36 +9 is 45. 45 +25 is 70. So, the sum of squared differences is 70.

Since there are six data points, I divide 70 by 6 to get the variance. Let me calculate that: 70 รท 6. Well, 6*11 is 66, so 70-66 is 4, so 11 and 4/6, which simplifies to 11.666... approximately. But wait, I think variance can be reported as a decimal, so maybe 11.666... rounds to 11.67 or something. Looking at the options, I don't see exactly 11.666, but option H is 12.5, which is higher. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, let me check the sum again. 25 +9 is 34, yes. Plus 1 is 35, plus another 1 is 36, plus 9 is 45, plus 25 is 70. That's correct. So 70 divided by 6 is approximately 11.6667. Looking at the options, the closest one is option D: 11.7, which would be 11.6667 rounded to one decimal place. Option H is 12.5, which is higher. So I think D is the correct choice.

Wait, but sometimes variance is calculated using n-1 instead of n for sample variance. Oh right, if this is a sample, we use n-1. But the question doesn't specify whether it's a population or a sample. Hmm, the problem says "the variance in ages," so I think it's referring to the population variance, which uses n. So 70/6 is about 11.6667, so the answer should be D:11.7.

The variance in the ages of the six children is calculated by first finding the mean age, which is 11. Then, the squared differences from the mean are computed for each age, summed to get 70, and divided by the number of children (6) to yield a variance of approximately 11.67. Rounding to one decimal place gives 11.7.

Answer: D
