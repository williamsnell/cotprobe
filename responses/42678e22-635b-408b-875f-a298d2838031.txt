Question:

A company invested in a new machine that will generate revenues of $35,000 annually for seven years. The company will have annual operating expenses of $7,000 on the new machine.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a company investing in a new machine. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

First, the question says the machine generates revenues of $35,000 annually for seven years. That's straightforward. So each year, they make $35k from it. Then, the company has annual operating expenses of $7,000. Wait, but within those operating expenses, there's a depreciation expense of $4,000 per year. Hmm, so I think I need to figure out the net cash flow each year.

Depreciation is a non-cash expense, right? So when calculating payback period, which is about cash flows, I shouldn't include depreciation in the cash outflow, but perhaps it's part of the operating expenses that are subtracted from revenue. Let me clarify.

The company's annual operating expenses are $7k, which includes $4k depreciation. So the operating expenses that are actual cash outflows would be $7k minus $4k, which is $3k? Or wait, maybe not. Because depreciation is a non-cash item, so for the cash flow, the operating expenses after considering depreciation would be $7k minus $4k, but wait, no. Let me think again.

Actually, when calculating net income, operating expenses include depreciation. But for cash flow, depreciation is added back because it's a non-cash expense. So the cash flow from operations each year would be revenue minus operating expenses plus depreciation. Wait, no, because operating expenses include depreciation. So if the total operating expenses are $7k, and $4k of that is depreciation, then the actual cash outflow from operating expenses is $7k - $4k = $3k? Because depreciation doesn't require cash.

So the annual cash inflow would be revenue minus cash operating expenses. So $35k revenue minus ($7k - $4k) which is $3k. So $35k - $3k = $32k per year in cash inflow.

Wait, but another way: sometimes, net cash flow is calculated as (Revenue - Operating Expenses) + Depreciation. Because operating expenses are after depreciation. So let me think. If the operating expenses are $7k, including $4k depreciation, then the actual cash operating expenses would be $7k - $4k = $3k. So the cash flow each year is $35k (revenue) minus $3k (cash operating expenses) = $32k.

Alternatively, the net income would be Revenue - Operating Expenses = $35k - $7k = $28k. But since depreciation is a non-cash expense, the cash flow would be $28k + $4k (depreciation) = $32k. Yeah, that makes sense. So the net cash flow per year is $32k.

The payback period is given as 5.2 years. The payback period formula is the initial investment divided by the annual net cash inflow. So if the payback period is 5.2 years, then Initial Investment = Cash Inflow per Year * Payback Period.

So let me plug in the numbers: Initial Investment = $32k * 5.2 = ?

Calculating 32,000 * 5 = 160,000. 32,000 * 0.2 = 6,400. So total is 166,400.

Looking at the options, option C is $166,400. So the company paid $166,400 for the machine.

Wait, but let me double-check. The machine has a 7-year life, but the payback period is 5.2 years. That means the initial investment is covered in 5.2 years. So the calculation seems correct. I think option C is the right answer.

The company's net annual cash inflow is calculated by subtracting the cash operating expenses (which exclude depreciation) from the annual revenue. The cash operating expenses are $7,000 total operating expenses minus $4,000 depreciation, resulting in $3,000. Thus, the annual net cash inflow is $35,000 (revenue) minus $3,000 (cash operating expenses), which equals $32,000.

Using the payback period formula: Initial Investment = Annual Net Cash Inflow × Payback Period. Substituting the values: Initial Investment = $32,000 × 5.2 = $166,400.

Answer: C
