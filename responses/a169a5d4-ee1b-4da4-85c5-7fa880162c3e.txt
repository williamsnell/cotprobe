Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Aquinas's natural law theory. The question is asking which of the options is a basic intrinsic good. The options are A: human life, B: human procreation, C: human sociability, and D: all of the above.

First, I remember that Thomas Aquinas was a medieval philosopher and theologian who developed the natural law theory. From what I've studied, natural law theory is based on the idea that humans can derive moral principles from human nature, which is guided by reason and oriented towards the good.

I think Aquinas considered certain things as basic goods that are ends in themselves, meaning they are valuable for their own sake. These goods are also referred to as intrinsic goods because their value comes from their nature rather than their utility.

Looking at the options:

A: Human life. I believe Aquinas would see human life as a fundamental good because it's the basis for all other goods. Without life, nothing else is possible. So human life itself is an intrinsic good.

B: Human procreation. Aquinas probably viewed procreation as a good because it's part of the natural order. He would see it as a way to ensure the continuation of the species and part of the natural law, contributing to the common good.

C: Human sociability. Aquinas also emphasized the importance of society and community. He might have seen human sociability, the ability and tendency to form social bonds, as an intrinsic good because it allows for cooperation, mutual support, and the development of moral virtues.

Putting this together, all three options A, B, and C seem to be basic intrinsic goods according to Aquinas. Therefore, the correct answer should be D: all of the above.

The answer is D: all of the above. Aquinas considered human life, procreation, and sociability as basic intrinsic goods.

Answer: D
