Okay, so I have this question about glycogen breakdown in muscles and what's formed initially. Hmm, I remember that glycogen is a storage form of glucose, right? When the body needs energy, especially during exercise, the muscles break down glycogen. 

I think the first step in glycogen breakdown is hydrolysis. Glycogen is a branched polymer of glucose. So, the breakdown starts by breaking the bonds between the glucose units. The initial breakdown would probably form some kind of phosphate ester because enzymes in the body often use phosphate as an energy source.

Wait, the first enzyme involved is phosphorylase. Oh right, glycogen phosphorylase. It cleaves the alpha-1,4 glycosidic bonds in glycogen. When it does that, it removes a glucose molecule and adds a phosphate group. So the product would be glucose-1-phosphate. Because the enzyme takes a glucose unit and phosphorylates it, attaching a phosphate at the 1st position.

Looking at the options, option I is glucose-1-phosphate. That makes sense because the initial product is a single glucose unit with a phosphate attached. Then, I think this glucose-1-phosphate is converted into glucose-6-phosphate by another enzyme, maybe phosphoglucoisomerase. But that's a later step, so the question is about the initial result, which should be glucose-1-phosphate.

Let me make sure. Glycogen breakdown starts by cleaving the bonds, and the first product is a glucose with a phosphate on carbon 1. So the answer should be I.

The initial step in glycogen breakdown involves the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase, which cleaves alpha-1,4 glycosidic bonds and removes a glucose unit while adding a phosphate group, forming glucose-1-phosphate. This is the first product of glycogen breakdown in muscle.

Answer: I
