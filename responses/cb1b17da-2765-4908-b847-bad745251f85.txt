Question:

Construct a complete truth table for the following argument. Then, using the truth table, determine whether the argument is valid or invalid. If the argument is invalid, choose an option which presents a counterexample. (There may be other counterexamples as well.)
~C ⊃ D
D ⊃ C / C

Options:

A: Invalid. Counterexample when C is true and D is false
B: Invalid. Counterexample when D is false and C is true
C: Invalid. Counterexample when C and D are true
D: Invalid. Counterexample when C and D are both false
E: Invalid. Counterexample when C is false and D is true
F: Invalid. Counterexample when D is true and C is false
G: Valid
H: Valid. No counterexample exists
I: Invalid. Counterexample when D and C are both true

Okay, so I have this logic problem to solve. It involves constructing a truth table for a given argument and then determining whether the argument is valid or invalid. If it's invalid, I need to pick the correct counterexample from the options provided.

The argument given is:

~C ⊃ D
D ⊃ C
_____
C

So, breaking it down, the premises are two conditional statements, and the conclusion is C. I need to check if whenever the premises are true, the conclusion is also true. If there's a case where the premises are true but the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid, and that case would be a counterexample.

First, I'll construct the truth table. There are two propositional variables here: C and D. So, each can be either true or false, leading to four possible combinations.

The columns I'll need are:

1. C
2. D
3. ~C
4. ~C ⊃ D
5. D ⊃ C
6. Conclusion: C
7. Premises (both premises) and whether they're both true
8. Whether the conclusion is true when the premises are true.

Let me go through each step.

1. List all possible truth values for C and D.

There are four rows:

Row 1: C=T, D=T
Row 2: C=T, D=F
Row 3: C=F, D=T
Row 4: C=F, D=F

2. For each row, compute ~C, then evaluate each premise.

Starting with Row 1: C=T, D=T

~C = F (since C is T)
~C ⊃ D: F ⊃ T. In logic, a false premise implies anything is true. So this is T.
D ⊃ C: T ⊃ T. Also T.
So premises are both T. Conclusion C is T. So in this row, premises true, conclusion true.

Row 2: C=T, D=F

~C=F
~C ⊃ D: F ⊃ F. Still T.
D ⊃ C: F ⊃ T. T.
So premises are both T. Conclusion C is T. So no issue here.

Row 3: C=F, D=T

~C=T
~C ⊃ D: T ⊃ T. T.
D ⊃ C: T ⊃ F. F.
So the second premise is F. So premises aren't both true. So we don't consider this row for validity.

Row 4: C=F, D=F

~C=T
~C ⊃ D: T ⊃ F. F.
D ⊃ C: F ⊃ F. T.
So here, the first premise is F, second is T. So premises not both true. So this row is irrelevant.

Wait, so in all the rows where the premises are true, the conclusion is also true. Because in Rows 1 and 2, premises are true, and conclusion is T in both.

Wait, but Row 1: premises true, conclusion T. Row 2: premises true, conclusion T. So in both cases, when premises are true, conclusion is true. So the argument should be valid. But wait, maybe I made a mistake because I'm getting that the argument is valid, but the options include some invalid options.

Wait, let me double-check each row.

Row 1: C=T, D=T
~C=F, so ~C⊃D is T.
D⊃C is T. So premises are both T. Conclusion C=T. So no problem.

Row 2: C=T, D=F
~C=F, so ~C⊃D is T.
D⊃C: D=F, C=T, so F⊃T is T.
So premises both T, conclusion T. So no problem.

Row3: C=F, D=T
~C=T, ~C⊃D is T⊃T=T.
D⊃C: T⊃F=F.
So premises: first T, second F. So not both T. So no issue.

Row4: C=F, D=F
~C=T, ~C⊃D: T⊃F=F.
D⊃C: F⊃F=T.
So first premise F, second T. Not both T. So no problem.

So in all cases where premises are true (Rows 1 and 2), conclusion is also true. Therefore, the argument is valid, meaning there are no counterexamples. So the argument is valid, so the answer would be G or H.

Wait, looking at the options:

G: Valid

H: Valid. No counterexample exists.

Wait, but both G and H seem to be the same. Maybe H is the more precise answer, but G is also correct. Wait, perhaps H is a more specific version of G. Let me check the options.

Options:

G: Valid

H: Valid. No counterexample exists.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is G, as it's a standard way to say it's valid. Alternatively, H is also correct, but since the question asks to determine validity, G would suffice.

But wait, let me think again. Is the argument actually valid? Because sometimes with conditional statements, things can be tricky.

Wait, the premises are ~C→D and D→C. So when both are true, what does that imply?

If ~C→D is true, and D→C is true, then what can we say about C?

Let's see: Suppose ~C→D and D→C. Then, if D is true, from D→C, C must be true. If D is false, then from ~C→D, since D is F, ~C must be F (because F→F is T, but if ~C is T, then D would have to be T, which it isn't. So if D is F, then ~C must be F, meaning C is T. So in either case, C must be T.

So whenever the premises are true, C is true. So the argument is indeed valid.

Wait, but earlier when I constructed the truth table, in all rows where premises are true, C is true. So the argument is valid, which would make the correct answer either G or H. But looking at the options, H says "Valid. No counterexample exists," which is accurate because there are no cases where premises are true and conclusion is false.

So the correct answer is H.

Wait, but looking back at the options, G is "Valid" and H is "Valid. No counterexample exists." So both are correct, but H is more specific. However, sometimes in multiple-choice questions, they might have H as the correct answer, but perhaps the intended answer is G.

Wait, but the user's options include H as an option. So perhaps the answer is H.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the truth table. Let me double-check.

In Row 2: C=T, D=F.

~C=F, so ~C→D is F→F, which is T.

D→C is F→T, which is T.

So premises are both T, conclusion C=T. So no problem.

In Row 1: C=T, D=T.

~C→D is T→T=T.

D→C is T→T=T.

Conclusion C=T.

In Row 3: C=F, D=T.

~C=T, so ~C→D=T→T=T.

D→C=T→F=F.

So premises not both T.

Row4: C=F, D=F.

~C=T, so ~C→D=T→F=F.

D→C=F→F=T.

So premises not both T.

Thus, the only rows where premises are both T are Rows 1 and 2, and in both, conclusion is T.

So the argument is valid, so the answer is G or H. But looking at the options, option G is "Valid," and H is "Valid. No counterexample exists." So either would be correct, but perhaps the intended answer is G.

But wait, the user's options are:

A: Invalid. Counterexample when C is true and D is false

B: Invalid. Counterexample when D is false and C is true

C: Invalid. Counterexample when C and D are true

D: Invalid. Counterexample when C and D are both false

E: Invalid. Counterexample when C is false and D is true

F: Invalid. Counterexample when D is true and C is false

G: Valid

H: Valid. No counterexample exists

I: Invalid. Counterexample when D and C are both true

Wait, so H is a valid option, but perhaps the correct answer is G. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H because it explicitly mentions no counterexample.

But wait, the way the question is phrased: "If the argument is invalid, choose an option which presents a counterexample. If the argument is valid, choose G or H accordingly."

Wait, but according to my analysis, the argument is valid. So the correct answer is either G or H.

Looking at the options again, H says "Valid. No counterexample exists," which is correct. So perhaps H is the intended answer. Alternatively, G is also correct, but H is more precise.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the premises. Let me think differently: perhaps the argument is not valid because when D is F and C is T, the premises are true but conclusion is T, which is okay. Wait, but in that case, conclusion is T, which aligns with the premises being T.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the logical equivalence. The premises are ~C→D and D→C. Combining these, we have ~C→D and D→C, which together imply C↔D. So the conclusion is C, but does C↔D entail C?

Yes, because if C↔D is true, then whenever D is true, C is true, and when D is false, C is false. So if we have C↔D, then C is equivalent to D. But the conclusion is just C, so if C↔D, then C must be true whenever D is true, and false when D is false.

Wait, but the premises together mean that C and D are equivalent. So if the premises are true, then C is equivalent to D. But the conclusion is C. So when would the premises be true but conclusion false?

If C is F and D is F: but wait, in that case, ~C is T, so ~C→D is T→F=F. So the first premise is F. So the premises can't both be true in that case.

Alternatively, if C is F and D is T: then ~C→D is T→T=T, and D→C is T→F=F. So the second premise is F, so premises not both true.

So in all cases where the premises are both true, C must be T. So the argument is valid.

Thus, the correct answer is H: Valid. No counterexample exists.
</think>

The argument is valid because in all cases where the premises are true, the conclusion is also true. The premises ~C→D and D→C together imply that C and D are logically equivalent. Therefore, whenever the premises hold, the conclusion C must be true. There are no counterexamples where the premises are true and the conclusion is false.
