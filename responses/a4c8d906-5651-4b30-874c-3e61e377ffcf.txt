Question:

Explain how an estimate of the age of a rock is made on the basisof the radioactive elements present.

Options:

A: By assessing the fossil content found within the rock layers
B: By comparing the density of the rock to a known age database
C: By examining the color and texture of the rock
D: By counting the layers of the rock
E: By measuring the amount of carbon-14 remaining in the rock
F: By observing the size and weight of the rock
G: By measuring the proportion of uranium and lead in a given rock, we can estimate with a high degree of accuracy the absolute age of the rock.
H: By calculating the rate of sediment deposition on the rock
I: By determining the magnetic properties of the rock
J: By analyzing the chemical composition of minerals within the rock for wear and degradation patterns

Alright, so I have this question about how the age of a rock is estimated using radioactive elements. I'm a bit rusty on my geology, but I'll try to think it through.

Okay, the question is asking about the method used to estimate a rock's age based on radioactive elements. I remember something about radioactive dating from school. There are a few methods, like carbon dating, but wait, that's specifically for organic materials and only goes back a certain amount of time. Carbon-14 is used for that, right? But that's option E. Hmm.

Wait, the question is about rocks. So maybe it's a different method. Oh, right! There's something called radiometric dating. I think that involves measuring the decay of radioactive isotopes within the rock. Like uranium decaying into lead, or potassium into argon. Yeah, that's it.

Looking at the options, option G says, "By measuring the proportion of uranium and lead in a given rock, we can estimate with a high degree of accuracy the absolute age of the rock." That sounds right because uranium decays into lead over time. So by measuring how much uranium is left compared to lead, you can figure out how old the rock is.

Option E mentions carbon-14, which I know is used for dating things like fossils or organic remains, not really for rocks. So E is probably not the right answer here. Option A talks about fossils, which again is more about relative dating, not absolute age, and it's not based on radioactive elements. Option B is about density, which I don't think relates to radioactive dating. Option C is about color and texture—doesn't make sense. D is about layers, maybe like tree rings, but that's more relative dating too. F is size and weight—nope. H is sediment deposition rate, which might be part of relative dating but not the radioactive method. I is magnetic properties, which relates to something like paleomagnetism, maybe for determining when the rock was formed based on Earth's magnetic field changes, but that's not radioactive. J is about chemical composition wear, which sounds more like weathering, not radioactive dating.

So putting it all together, the correct method for absolute age using radioactive elements is measuring the proportions of parent and daughter isotopes, like uranium and lead. So the answer should be G.

The correct method for estimating the age of a rock based on radioactive elements involves measuring the proportion of uranium and lead, as uranium decays into lead over time. This allows for a high degree of accuracy in determining the absolute age of the rock.

Answer: G
