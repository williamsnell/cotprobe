Okay, so I've got this problem about osmotic pressure and finding the molecular weight of a sugar. Hmm, I remember osmotic pressure is related to concentration, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think.

The question says that 9.0 grams of sugar were dissolved in 500 grams of water. The osmotic pressure at 27°C is 2.46 atm. I need to find the molecular weight of the sugar. The options are given, so maybe I can work through the calculations step by step.

First, I recall that osmotic pressure (π) is calculated using the formula π = iCRT. Oh wait, right, i is the van't Hoff factor, C is the concentration in mol/L, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

Since it's sugar, I think it doesn't dissociate in water. So the van't Hoff factor i should be 1 because it's a non-electrolyte. Yeah, that makes sense. So i = 1.

Next, the temperature is given as 27°C. I need to convert that to Kelvin. Kelvin is Celsius plus 273.15, so 27 + 273.15 = 300.15 K. I'll just use 300 K for simplicity.

The osmotic pressure is 2.46 atm. R, the gas constant, I think is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). So R = 0.0821.

Now, I can rearrange the formula to solve for C (concentration). So C = π / (iRT). Plugging in the numbers: C = 2.46 atm / (1 * 0.0821 * 300). Let me calculate that denominator first. 0.0821 * 300 is... 0.0821 * 300 = 24.63. So 2.46 divided by 24.63 is approximately 0.1 mol/L. Wait, let me check: 24.63 times 0.1 is 2.463, which is close to 2.46, so yeah, C ≈ 0.1 mol/L.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check that calculation. 2.46 divided by 24.63. Let me do it step by step. 24.63 times 0.1 is indeed 2.463, which is a bit more than 2.46. So maybe it's a little less than 0.1. Let me calculate more accurately: 24.63 * 0.0998 ≈ 2.46. Hmm, so maybe C is about 0.0998 mol/L, approximately 0.1 mol/L. I'll go with 0.1 for simplicity.

Now, concentration C is moles per liter. So the number of moles (n) is C multiplied by the volume in liters. The solution uses 500 grams of water. I need to find the volume in liters. Wait, but wait, the mass of water is 500 g. The density of water is about 1 g/mL, so 500 g is 500 mL, which is 0.5 liters. So the volume V is 0.5 L.

So moles n = C * V = 0.1 mol/L * 0.5 L = 0.05 mol.

Wait, wait a second. That can't be right. Because 0.1 * 0.5 is 0.05, yes. But wait, the mass of sugar is 9.0 grams. So the molecular weight (M) is mass divided by moles. So M = mass / n.

Mass is 9.0 g. Moles are 0.05 mol. So M = 9.0 / 0.05 = 180 g/mol.

Wait, but wait. Let me check again. Because the concentration calculation might have been a bit off. Let me recalculate C more accurately. So π = iCRT → C=π/(iRT).

π = 2.46 atm, i=1, R=0.0821, T=300. So C = 2.46 / (1 * 0.0821 * 300).

Calculating denominator: 0.0821 * 300 = 24.63. So 2.46 /24.63 = 0.09987 mol/L, approximately 0.0999 mol/L. So about 0.0999 mol/L.

Then, volume is 0.5 L. So moles n = 0.0999 * 0.5 = 0.04995 mol, approximately 0.05 mol.

So M = 9.0 g / 0.05 mol = 180 g/mol.

Looking at the options, option A is 180 g/mol. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake with the concentration. Because sometimes, for dilute solutions, the concentration can be approximated as moles of solute over the volume of solution. But in this case, the solution's volume is roughly the volume of the solvent (water) because sugar is a solid dissolved. So 500 g water is 0.5 L, so that's correct.

Alternatively, sometimes when the solute is a significant portion, the volume might change, but since 9g in 500g is 1.8% by mass, which is pretty dilute, so the volume of solution is close to 500 mL. So the calculation should be correct.

Hmm, but wait, another approach: using the formula π = (m * M) * (R T) / (1000 * 1), where m is molality. Wait, no, osmotic pressure is calculated using molarity (concentration) not molality, so the first approach is correct.

So yeah, the molecular weight comes out to 180 g/mol, which is option A.

To determine the molecular weight of the sugar, we use the osmotic pressure formula:

\[
\pi = iCRT
\]

Where:
- \( \pi = 2.46 \, \text{atm} \) (osmotic pressure),
- \( i = 1 \) (van't Hoff factor for sugar, a non-electrolyte),
- \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \) (gas constant),
- \( T = 300 \, \text{K} \) (temperature in Kelvin).

Rearranging for concentration \( C \):

\[
C = \frac{\pi}{iRT} = \frac{2.46}{1 \cdot 0.0821 \cdot 300} \approx 0.0999 \, \text{mol/L}.
\]

The solution volume is \( 500 \, \text{g} \) of water, which is \( 0.5 \, \text{L} \) (since water density is \( 1 \, \text{g/mL} \)).

Moles of sugar:

\[
n = C \cdot V = 0.0999 \cdot 0.5 \approx 0.04995 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Mass of sugar is \( 9.0 \, \text{g} \). Molecular weight \( M \):

\[
M = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{moles}} = \frac{9.0}{0.04995} \approx 180 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

Thus, the molecular weight of the sugar is **180 g/mol**, corresponding to option A.
