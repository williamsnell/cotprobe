Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about graph problems and their solvability in polynomial time. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question is asking which of the given problems is known to be solvable in polynomial time. The options are A to I. I remember that polynomial time means the problem can be solved efficiently, without taking an impractically long time even for large inputs.

Let me list out the options again to make sure I get them right:

A: Finding the longest path in G
B: Finding a longest simple cycle in G
C: Finding all Hamiltonian cycles in G
D: Finding a largest clique in G
E: Finding a minimum vertex cover in G
F: Finding a maximum independent set in G
G: Finding a minimum dominating set in G
H: Finding a maximum clique in G
I: Finding a shortest cycle in G

Hmm, I think I need to recall what each of these problems entails and whether they have known polynomial-time solutions.

Starting with option A: Longest path in an undirected graph. I remember that finding the longest path is different from the shortest path. For directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), the longest path can be found using topological sorting, which is efficient. But wait, the question is about undirected graphs. Oh right, in undirected graphs, the longest path problem is actually NP-hard. Because it's similar to the Hamiltonian path problem, which is also NP-hard. So A is not solvable in polynomial time.

Option B: Longest simple cycle. A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex without repeating edges or vertices (except the start/end). Finding the longest such cycle sounds similar to the traveling salesman problem, which is also NP-hard. So B is probably not polynomial time.

C: Finding all Hamiltonian cycles. A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits every vertex exactly once. Even finding one Hamiltonian cycle is NP-complete, so finding all of them would definitely be harder, more than polynomial time. So C is out.

D: Largest clique. A clique is a subset of vertices where every two are connected by an edge. Finding the largest clique is the same as finding the maximum clique problem, which is NP-hard. So D is not polynomial.

E: Minimum vertex cover. A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The minimum vertex cover problem is to find the smallest such set. Wait, I think this is where Konig's theorem comes into play. Konig's theorem states that in bipartite graphs, the size of the maximum matching equals the size of the minimum vertex cover. And maximum matching can be found in polynomial time using algorithms like the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm. So for bipartite graphs, yes, it's polynomial. But the question says "a given undirected graph G," not necessarily bipartite. Oh, wait, no, Konig's theorem applies only to bipartite graphs. So for general graphs, the minimum vertex cover is NP-hard. Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm confusing things. Oh wait, no, the vertex cover problem is NP-hard for general graphs, but if it's bipartite, it's solvable in polynomial time. Since the question doesn't specify bipartition, I think E is NP-hard, so not polynomial.

F: Maximum independent set. An independent set is a set of vertices with no edges between them. Finding the maximum independent set is equivalent to finding the maximum clique in the complement graph, which is also NP-hard. So F is not polynomial.

G: Minimum dominating set. A dominating set is a subset of vertices such that every vertex is either in the set or adjacent to a vertex in the set. The minimum dominating set problem is also NP-hard, I believe, so G isn't polynomial.

H: Maximum clique. As I thought earlier, this is NP-hard, same as the maximum independent set. So H is out.

I: Shortest cycle in G. This is the problem of finding the cycle with the least number of edges or the least weight. For an undirected graph, finding the shortest cycle can be done using algorithms like BFS if the graph is unweighted. Wait, for unweighted graphs, BFS can find the shortest path between two nodes. But to find the shortest cycle, one approach is to find the shortest path between each pair of nodes and see if there's a back edge, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, for each edge (u, v), remove the edge and find the shortest path between u and v in the remaining graph. If such a path exists, the cycle length is (path length) + 1. The minimum over all edges would give the shortest cycle. But wait, for each edge, we run BFS, which is O(V+E) per edge. So overall, it's O(E*(V+E)). For a graph with E up to V², this would be O(V³), which is polynomial time. So finding the shortest cycle is solvable in polynomial time.

Wait, but another approach is using BFS starting from each node and stopping when you find a back edge. For an undirected graph, the BFS tree can be used to find the shortest cycle. Alternatively, the problem can be reduced to finding the girth of the graph, which is the length of the shortest cycle. I think the algorithm for this involves BFS and checking for cross edges, which can be done in polynomial time.

So looking back, the only option that's polynomial time is I: Finding a shortest cycle in G.

The question asks which of the given problems concerning an undirected graph \( G \) is solvable in polynomial time. To determine this, each option is analyzed based on its known complexity:

- **A**: Finding the longest path in \( G \) is NP-hard, as it resembles the Hamiltonian path problem.
- **B**: Finding the longest simple cycle is also NP-hard, akin to the traveling salesman problem.
- **C**: Finding all Hamiltonian cycles is harder than finding one, making it NP-hard.
- **D**: Finding the largest clique is equivalent to the maximum clique problem, which is NP-hard.
- **E**: Finding a minimum vertex cover is NP-hard for general graphs, though solvable in polynomial time for bipartite graphs.
- **F**: Finding a maximum independent set is NP-hard, as it is equivalent to finding the maximum clique in the complement graph.
- **G**: Finding a minimum dominating set is NP-hard.
- **H**: Finding a maximum clique is NP-hard.
- **I**: Finding a shortest cycle can be solved using BFS or similar algorithms in polynomial time.

Thus, the only problem solvable in polynomial time is **I**.
