Question:

A 37-year-old woman with right lower extremity edema is evaluated because of the sudden onset of shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain. A diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is made. Which of the following signs, if present on physical examination, would be the most specific indicator of pulmonary arterial hypertension in this patient?

Options:

A: Blue lips or skin
B: Peripheral edema
C: Rapid heart rate
D: Constant chest pain
E: Presence of an S3
F: Wheezing or whistling sound when breathing
G: Shortness of breath after slight activity
H: P2 louder than A2
I: Increased jugular venous pressure
J: Coughing up blood

Okay, I have this question here about a patient with pulmonary embolism and the signs indicating pulmonary arterial hypertension. Let's break it down step by step.

The patient is a 37-year-old woman with right lower extremity edema. She presents with sudden shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain, and a pulmonary embolism is diagnosed. The question is asking which physical exam sign is the most specific for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in this scenario.

First, I need to recall what pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is. PAH is a condition where the blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries is abnormally high. It can be a complication of pulmonary embolism if it's chronic and leads to right ventricular hypertrophy and eventually right-sided heart failure.

Now, the options given are A through J. I'll go through each one to see which is the most specific.

Option A: Blue lips or skin. This is a sign of hypoxia, which can occur in many respiratory conditions, not just PAH. So it's a general sign, not specific.

Option B: Peripheral edema. This patient already has right lower extremity edema, which is common in venous thromboembolism, including pulmonary embolism. But it's a common finding and not specific to PAH.

Option C: Rapid heart rate. Tachycardia can occur due to many reasons, like anxiety, fever, or the body's response to low oxygen levels. Not specific to PAH.

Option D: Constant chest pain. Pleuritic pain can occur in pulmonary embolism, but constant chest pain isn't specific to PAH.

Option E: Presence of an S3 heart sound. An S3 is often associated with heart failure, particularly left-sided, but it can also occur in right-sided failure. It's a sign of volume overload or cardiac dysfunction, which can happen in PAH, but it's not the most specific.

Option F: Wheezing or whistling sound. This is typically a sign of airway obstruction, like asthma or COPD. Not related to PAH.

Option G: Shortness of breath after slight activity. While dyspnea is a common symptom in pulmonary embolism and PAH, it's a general symptom and not specific.

Option H: P2 louder than A2. The P2 is the second heart sound in the pulmonary area, and A2 is the second heart sound in the aortic area. In PAH, the pressure in the pulmonary artery increases, which can cause the P2 to be prominent or even split into two components (P2a and P2b), making it loud. This is a specific sign of increased pulmonary artery pressure.

Option I: Increased jugular venous pressure. This is a sign of right-sided heart failure, which can occur in PAH when it's advanced. But it's not the most specific, as it can also occur in other causes of right heart failure, like right ventricular infarction or chronic lung disease.

Option J: Coughing up blood. Hemoptysis can occur in pulmonary embolism, but it's not specific to PAH.

So, putting it together, the most specific sign would be H: P2 louder than A2, as it directly relates to increased pulmonary artery pressure.

The most specific sign indicating pulmonary arterial hypertension in this patient is H: P2 louder than A2, as it directly correlates with increased pulmonary artery pressure.

Answer: H
