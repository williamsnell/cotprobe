Question:

Solve the following problems. (a) A plot of land containing 487 (1/2) acres were broken up into smaller plots containing 3 (1/4) acres apiece. Find the number of smaller plots that were formed. (b) 450 freshmen entered ahighschool. Of these only (2/3) will graduate four years later. Of those that graduate, (1/6) will receive an A average. Find how many graduating seniors will have an A average. (c) TheGoreman'sGlue Factory wishes to package 4,000 pints of glue in containerthat hold (2/3) pint each. How may containers are needed?

Options:

A: 145 plots, 45 graduating seniors with an A average, 6100 containers
B: 160 plots, 40 graduating seniors with an A average, 7000 containers
C: 135 plots, 65 graduating seniors with an A average, 5900 containers
D: 130 plots, 60 graduating seniors with an A average, 5000 containers
E: 125 plots, 75 graduating seniors with an A average, 5600 containers
F: 142 plots, 52 graduating seniors with an A average, 5800 containers
G: 155 plots, 42 graduating seniors with an A average, 6300 containers
H: 150 plots, 50 graduating seniors with an A average, 6000 containers
I: 140 plots, 55 graduating seniors with an A average, 6500 containers
J: 138 plots, 48 graduating seniors with an A average, 6200 containers

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question with three parts, and I need to figure out the correct answers for each. Let's take it step by step.

Starting with part (a): There's a plot of land that's 487 and a half acres, which I think is 487.5 acres. This needs to be divided into smaller plots, each containing 3 and a quarter acres, so that's 3.25 acres per plot. I need to find how many such plots can be made.

So, to find the number of plots, I should divide the total area by the size of each smaller plot. That is, 487.5 divided by 3.25. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 3.25 times 100 is 325, but that's not helpful. Maybe I can convert them to fractions to make it easier. 487.5 is the same as 487 1/2, which is 975/2 when converted to an improper fraction. Similarly, 3.25 is 13/4. So dividing 975/2 by 13/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/13. So (975 * 4) / (2 *13) = (3900)/(26). Let me compute that: 3900 divided by 26. Well, 26 times 150 is 3900, so the result is 150. So part (a) answer is 150 plots.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 150 plots, so that's one of them. But let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let me try decimal division again: 487.5 รท 3.25. Let me see, 3.25 times 100 is 325, so 3.25 * 150 is 487.5 because 3.25 * 100 is 325, plus 3.25 *50 is 162.5, so 325 +162.5 is 487.5. Yes, so 150 is correct.

Moving on to part (b): There are 450 freshmen. Only 2/3 will graduate. So first, find how many graduate. 450 * (2/3) = 300 students. Then, of those who graduate, 1/6 will receive an A average. So 300 * (1/6) = 50 students. So the answer for part (b) is 50 graduating seniors with an A average.

Looking at the options, option H has 50, which matches part (b). So far, H is looking good.

Now part (c): The factory has 4,000 pints of glue and each container holds 2/3 of a pint. They need to find how many containers are needed. So, total pints divided by pints per container: 4000 รท (2/3). Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so 4000 * (3/2) = (4000 *3)/2 = 12,000 / 2 = 6,000 containers. So for part (c), the answer is 6,000 containers.

Again, looking at the options, option H has 6,000 containers for part (c). So all three parts of the question have answers matching option H: 150 plots, 50 A average graduates, and 6,000 containers.

For part (a), dividing 487.5 acres by 3.25 acres per plot gives 150 plots. For part (b), 2/3 of 450 freshmen graduate, and 1/6 of those 300 graduates get an A, totaling 50. For part (c), 4000 pints divided by 2/3 pint per container equals 6000 containers. 

H: 150 plots, 50 graduates, 6000 containers.
