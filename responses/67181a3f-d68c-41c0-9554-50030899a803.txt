Okay, so I need to figure out how much China's GDP per capita increased from 1950 to 2016, controlling for inflation and PPP adjustment. Hmm, I'm not exactly an expert, but I'll try to think this through.

First, I remember that GDP per capita is calculated by dividing the country's total GDP by its population. So, it's a measure of average economic output per person. Controlling for inflation means we're looking at real GDP, which adjusts for the effects of inflation over time. PPP adjustment stands for Purchasing Power Parity, which adjusts for the differences in the cost of living across countries, allowing for a more accurate comparison.

I think China's economy has grown significantly over the past few decades, especially since改革开放 (the opening up and economic reforms) started in 1978. But 1950 is a bit earlier than that. So, I'm not sure what the situation was in 1950. I believe China was largely agrarian and had a planned economy under the communists, so their GDP per capita might have been quite low.

Now, I'm trying to remember some rough figures. I think that by 2016, China's GDP per capita was around $8,000 to $9,000 when adjusted for PPP. But I'm not sure about the exact number. Let me think about the growth rates. China's economy has been growing at a rapid pace, maybe around 7-8% annually for many years. But this is average growth, so over 66 years, the growth would compound.

Wait, but the question is about the increase from 1950 to 2016. Let me break it down. From 1950 to 2016 is 66 years. If I use the rule of 72, which is a quick way to estimate how long it takes for something to double given a fixed annual growth rate, I can maybe get a rough idea. But I don't know the exact growth rate for each period, especially since the growth rate might have varied.

Alternatively, I might remember some approximate data points. In 1950, China's GDP per capita was very low. Maybe around $100 or so in PPP terms? I'm not certain. By 2016, as I thought earlier, it was maybe around $8,000. So, if I take $8,000 divided by $100, that's an 80-fold increase. But that's not one of the options. The options are A:20, B:12, C:25, D:64, E:8, F:4, G:50, H:40, I:16, J:32.

Wait, maybe my initial figures are off. Perhaps in 1950, the GDP per capita was even lower. Alternatively, maybe in PPP terms, it's adjusted differently. I think the World Bank or other sources might have data on this. But since I can't look it up, I have to rely on memory.

Another approach: I remember that China's GDP per capita has increased significantly, but not as high as 64 times. Let me think about the options. Option D is 64-fold. That would mean if it was $100 in 1950, it's $6,400 in 2016. But I thought it was higher than that. Wait, maybe I was wrong about the 2016 figure. Maybe it was around $12,000, which would make it a 120-fold increase, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the base year's GDP per capita was higher.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of growth rates. Let's say the average annual growth rate was around 5% after adjusting for inflation and PPP. Over 66 years, the growth factor would be (1.05)^66. Let me calculate that roughly. 1.05^66 is approximately (since 1.05^70 is about 4.3, so 1.05^66 is around 3.5 or so). But that's only a 3.5-fold increase, which is not matching the options. So maybe the growth rate was higher.

Wait, but China's growth rate was much higher, especially after 1978. Let's say from 1978 onwards, the growth rate was around 8% for 38 years (since 1978 to 2016 is about 38 years). The growth factor for that period would be (1.08)^38. Let's see: 1.08^30 is about 5.6, and 1.08^38 is around 10 or so. So that's a 10-fold increase from 1978. But we're going back to 1950, so from 1950 to 1978 is about 28 years. If the growth during that period was lower, say 2%, then the growth factor is (1.02)^28 ≈ 1.64. So total growth from 1950 to 2016 would be 1.64 * 10 ≈ 16.4-fold. That's close to option I:16 fold.

Alternatively, maybe the growth rate from 1950 to 1978 was higher than 2%. Let's say 3%, then (1.03)^28 ≈ 2.0, so total growth would be 2 * 10 = 20-fold, which is option A.

But I'm not sure. I think the growth from 1978 onwards was higher, so perhaps the overall increase is more than 20-fold. Alternatively, maybe the starting point was lower than $100. Suppose in 1950, it was $50. If in 2016 it's $3,200, that's a 64-fold increase (3200/50=64), which is option D. But I'm not sure if the 2016 figure was that high.

Alternatively, maybe the data is from the World Bank. Let me try to recall some rough numbers. In 1950, China's GDP per capita (PPP) was around $1,200. Wait, no, that can't be right because that would mean a much lower increase. Wait, no, in 1950, China's economy was very poor, so perhaps the PPP adjusted GDP per capita was around $500. If by 2016, it's around $32,000, that would be a 64-fold increase (32,000 / 500 = 64), which is option D.

But I'm not certain. Another angle: I remember reading that China's GDP per capita has increased by about 25 times since 1978. Wait, that would be from around $150 to around $3,750, which is 25 times. But that's from 1978, not 1950. So from 1950 to 2016 is a longer period. If from 1950 to 1978, it increased by, say, 3 times, and then from 1978 to 2016, 25 times, the total would be 3 *25=75 times, which isn't an option. Alternatively, maybe the increase from 1950 to 2016 is around 25 times, which is option C.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to think of another way. The options include 25-fold (C), 64-fold (D), 16-fold (I), etc. I think the correct answer is around 25 times, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's 64 times.

Wait, another approach: using logarithms. The growth factor is final divided by initial. If the growth rate is r per year, then (1+r)^t = growth factor. So, if t=66 years, and let's say average growth rate is 6%, then (1.06)^66 ≈ e^(0.06*66) ≈ e^3.96 ≈ 52. So growth factor is around 52, which is close to option H:40 or G:50. But 52 isn't an option. Alternatively, if the growth rate is higher, say 7%, then (1.07)^66 ≈ e^(0.07*66) ≈ e^4.62 ≈ 105, which is way higher than any option. So perhaps the average growth rate is lower.

Alternatively, perhaps the growth rate was around 5% over 66 years. (1.05)^66 ≈ e^(0.05*66) ≈ e^3.3 ≈ 27.5, which is close to option C:25 or D:64. Hmm, 27.5 is closer to 25, which is option C.

But I'm not sure if the growth rate was consistently 5% for 66 years. It might have been lower in the early years and higher later. From 1950 to 1978, perhaps the growth was slower, and then it picked up after 1978.

So, maybe from 1950 to 1978, growth was around 2% for 28 years, giving a factor of ~2. Then from 1978 to 2016, 38 years at 8%, giving a factor of ~10, so total factor is 2*10=20, which is option A:20 fold.

But I'm not sure. I think the answer is around 25 to 64 times. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 25 times, which is option C.

Wait, another thought: I've heard that China's economy grew by about 25 times in the 20th century, but that's from 1900s to 2000s, which is a different period. Alternatively, perhaps from 1950 to 2016, it's about 25 times, making option C correct.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is 64 times, which is option D. Because if the growth rate is higher, say 8% for 66 years, that would be (1.08)^66 which is way higher than 64, but that's unrealistic. So perhaps the correct answer is around 25 times.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of another angle. I think the correct answer is D:64 fold. Because I remember reading somewhere that China's GDP per capita increased by about 64 times from 1950 to 2016 after adjusting for inflation and PPP. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's 25 times.

Wait, another approach: let's say in 1950, China's GDP per capita was $100 (PPP). By 2016, it's $8,000, which is 80 times. But that's not an option. However, if the starting point was $200, then 2016 would be $12,800 (which is 64 times), so option D. Alternatively, if it started at $500, then 2016 would be $32,000, which is 64 times.

But I'm not certain about the exact figures. I think the answer is D:64 fold. Because I've heard that figure before, but I'm not 100% sure.

The question asks about the increase in China's GDP per capita from 1950 to 2016, controlling for inflation and PPP adjustment. After considering various factors, including growth rates and historical data, the most plausible answer is a 64-fold increase, which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
