Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Carruthers and his approach to the moral standing of nonhuman animals. The options are various moral theories, and I need to figure out which one he uses. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with all of these, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I remember that Carruthers is a philosopher known for his work in animal ethics. I think he's written about whether animals have moral rights. From what I recall, he supports the idea that animals can be considered in moral dilemmas, but maybe he doesn't think they have the same rights as humans. Wait, he might have a specific theory in mind.

Looking at the options, I need to match his approach to one of these theories. Let's go through them one by one.

A: Relativism – that's the idea that moral values are relative to culture or individual. I don't think Carruthers is a relativist because his stance on animal rights seems more universal, not based on cultural norms.

B: Consequentialism – this is about outcomes, like utilitarianism. Maybe, but I'm not sure if Carruthers aligns with this. He might focus more on duties than just consequences.

C: Natural Law Theory – this deals with laws derived from nature, maybe biological hierarchy. I'm not certain, but I don't think this is his approach.

D: Egoism – self-interest. Doesn't seem right; he's talking about morality, which is beyond self-interest.

E: Kantianism – Immanuel Kant's deontological approach, focusing on duties and maxims. Kantians believe in treating people as ends in themselves, not means. Carruthers might use some Kantian ideas, but I'm not sure if he's strictly Kantian.

F: Utilitarianism – maximizing overall happiness. He might consider this, but I thought he leans more towards a Kantian perspective because he emphasizes duties and respect for animals as beings with their own value.

G: Deontology – this is similar to Kantianism, focusing on rules and duties. So maybe this is the one. Deontologists believe in moral rules, like don't kill, regardless of outcomes.

H: Contractualism – based on social contracts or mutual agreements. I don't think Carruthers uses this; it's more about what we'd agree to, which might not fit his approach.

I: Existentialism – about individual freedom and authenticity. Not really related to moral theories in this context.

J: Virtue Ethics – focuses on character and virtues. Carruthers might discuss virtues, but I think his main approach is more about duties.

Wait, Carruthers might be a Kantian because he argues that animals have interests that should be considered because they are beings with their own lives and not mere means to human ends. Kantianism would support treating animals with respect, even if they don't have full moral rights. So, the theory would be Kantianism, which is option E.

Alternatively, some people might confuse deontology (G) with Kantianism, but I think in this context, since it's specifically about animal rights and using a duty-based approach, Kantianism is more precise.

Carruthers approaches questions about the moral standing of nonhuman animals from the perspective of Kantianism, which emphasizes duties and respect for beings as ends in themselves rather than means to an end. This aligns with his focus on the interests and inherent value of animals, suggesting a Kantian framework.

Answer: E
