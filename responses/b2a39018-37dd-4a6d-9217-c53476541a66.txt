Okay, so I need to figure out which option correctly describes how the Aztec Empire was based on systematic expansion. Let me think through this step by step. 

First, I remember that the Aztec Empire was a highly centralized and expansionist empire in Mesoamerica. Their expansion was driven by several factors, including military conquest, but I also recall that their system was more complex than just that. 

Looking at the options:

A: a vast network of roads and trade routes. I know the Aztecs built roads, especially the causeways in the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan. But was their expansion mainly based on this? I'm not sure. Roads helped with trade and communication, but was that the primary method of expansion?

B: the expansion and control of waterways for transportation and irrigation. The Aztecs were good at managing water, especially in the swampy areas around Lake Texcoco. They built canals and used waterways for transportation and agriculture. But was this the main method of expansion? Maybe, but I'm not certain.

C: the cultivation and trade of cacao and maize. Cacao was indeed important, especially for their economy and as a luxury item. Maize was their staple crop. But while trade was significant, was their expansion primarily about cultivating and trading these goods? I think their expansion was more about control and tribute rather than just trade.

D: religious beliefs that required extensive and escalating human sacrifice. While human sacrifice was a significant part of Aztec religion, I don't think their expansion was based solely on that. It was more of a justification for control and perhaps to appease their gods, but not the main method of expansion.

E: tribute in the form of gold, jade, feathers, cloth, and jewels. This rings a bell. The Aztecs required tribute from conquered peoples, and this tribute included various goods. This system of tribute collection was a key part of their empire's economy and control. So this might be a strong candidate.

F: the establishment of colonies in unexplored territories. The Aztecs did expand into new territories, but I'm not sure if they established colonies in the European sense. They more likely conquered and integrated existing cities into their empire, extracting tribute rather than setting up colonies.

G: ceramic production, a distinctive architectural style, and artistic expression. These were aspects of their culture, but not the basis of their expansion. Their architecture, like the Templo Mayor, was impressive, but that's more about their society than how they expanded.

H: farming techniques such as terracing and irrigation. While they did use advanced farming techniques, this was more about supporting their population and economy rather than the expansion itself. The expansion was more about military and political control.

I: a strict caste system that promoted social stratification. The Aztecs did have a social hierarchy, but I don't think the expansion was based on the caste system. It was more about the structure of their society once they had expanded.

J: oppressive social and religious control based on military conquest. This seems plausible. The Aztecs used military conquest to expand and then imposed their social and religious systems on conquered peoples. They were known for their military prowess and their empire was built through conquest.

Wait, but option E is about tribute, which was a result of their expansion. The question is about what the empire was based on for expansion. So, the expansion itself was through military conquest, which allowed them to collect tribute. So, perhaps J is more about the method of control after expansion, whereas E is the result.

Wait, the question is about the "systematic expansion of." So, what did they expand through? They expanded through military conquest, which allowed them to impose tribute. But looking back at the options, J says "oppressive social and religious control based on military conquest." That sounds like the method they used. Alternatively, E is about the tribute system, which was part of their control after expansion.

Alternatively, the expansion was primarily through military means, but the question is about what the empire was based on. Let me think again. The Aztecs expanded their empire by conquering other city-states, and they maintained control through a system of tribute. So the expansion was based on military conquest, but the tribute was the means of extracting resources.

Wait, the options are phrased as "based on the systematic expansion of." So, the expansion itself was of which aspect. So, the Aztec Empire expanded by conquering territories and then extracting tribute. So the expansion was based on military conquest, but the options don't have that directly. Let me check the options again.

Looking at option J: oppressive social and religious control based on military conquest. This seems to encapsulate the method of expansion and control. They conquered through military means and then imposed their social and religious systems. That makes sense.

Alternatively, option E is about the tribute they received, which was a part of their expansion but perhaps not the method of expansion itself. The expansion was the military aspect, leading to the tribute.

Wait, the question is about what the empire was based on for its expansion. So, the expansion was primarily through military conquest, but how did they manage their expansion? They imposed a system of tribute and control, which was part of their social and religious structure. So perhaps J is the answer.

Wait, another angle: the Aztecs' expansion was systematic in terms of their tribute system. They built a network where they tribute from various regions. So maybe E is the answer because the empire was built on the system of collecting tribute, which was the foundation of their expansion.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about what the Aztec Empire's expansion was known for. They were known for their network of tribute, which was a central part of their empire's economy. They expanded to collect tribute, which included gold, jade, feathers, etc. So their expansion was systematic in the sense that they organized the collection of these tributes from conquered regions.

So, the expansion was based on tribute, making option E correct. Or was the expansion based on military conquest, making J correct?

Wait, the question is "The Aztec Empire was based on the systematic expansion of:" So, the expansion itself was of what? It was the expansion of their control, which involved tribute. So, the empire was based on the systematic expansion of tribute, which they collected from conquered regions.

Alternatively, the expansion was done through military means, and the tribute was the result. So, perhaps the expansion was based on military conquest, but that's not one of the options. Looking back, the options are A to J, and J is about military conquest as part of social and religious control.

Wait, another approach: the Aztec Empire's expansion was primarily through military campaigns, and once they conquered a region, they imposed a system where the conquered peoples had to pay tribute. So the expansion was based on military conquest, which allowed them to collect tribute. But the options don't directly have military conquest as an option. So, perhaps J is the closest, as it involves military conquest as part of their control.

Alternatively, the expansion was about building a vast network of tribute, which was E. So, which is it?

I think the key is that the Aztec Empire's expansion was driven by the need to collect tribute, which was essential for their economy and power. So, their expansion was systematic in terms of tribute collection. Therefore, the answer is E.

The Aztec Empire's expansion was driven by the need to collect tribute from conquered regions, which was essential for their economy and power. The systematic expansion was based on the collection of gold, jade, feathers, cloth, and jewels, making option E the correct answer.

Answer: E
