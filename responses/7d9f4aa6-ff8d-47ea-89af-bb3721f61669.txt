Question:

The cells of humans and most animals have become adapted to surviving only within a relatively small range of hydrogen ion concentrations. What is the role of the kidneys in regulating hydrogen ion concentration?

Options:

A: The kidneys filter out hydrogen ions and recycle them into other cellular processes.
B: The kidneys regulate the hydrogen ion concentration of the extracellular fluids by excreting either acidic or basic constituents when the levels deviate from normal.
C: The kidneys maintain a constant production of hydrogen ions, regardless of the body's needs.
D: The kidneys produce hydrogen ions to maintain balance.
E: The kidneys eliminate all hydrogen ions from the body.
F: The kidneys detect hydrogen ion levels and signal other organs to adjust their pH levels accordingly.
G: The kidneys release enzymes that directly neutralize hydrogen ions in the bloodstream.
H: The kidneys convert hydrogen ions into inert gases that are exhaled.
I: The kidneys store hydrogen ions for future use.
J: The kidneys absorb all hydrogen ions, preventing them from affecting the body's pH balance.

Okay, so I've got this question about how the kidneys regulate hydrogen ion concentration. Hmm, I remember that hydrogen ions are related to acidity, right? pH levels depend on their concentration. The question is asking specifically what role the kidneys play in this.

Let me think about what I know. The body has to maintain a stable pH, usually around 7.4. If the hydrogen ion concentration is too high, the blood becomes acidic, and if too low, it's too basic. So the kidneys must have a role in this regulation.

I remember that the kidneys are involved in excreting waste, including acids. So maybe when there's too much acid, the kidneys get rid of it. But wait, it's not just about excreting; they might also handle the ions in the blood. 

Looking at the options, option A says the kidneys filter out hydrogen ions and recycle them. I'm not sure about the recycling part. I think the kidneys do excrete excess ions, but do they recycle them? Maybe not the primary role.

Option B says the kidneys regulate the concentration by excreting acidic or basic stuff when levels are off. That makes sense because if the blood is too acidic, the kidneys would excrete more acid (as H+ ions), and if too basic, they might retain more. Or wait, no, when the blood is acidic, the kidneys excrete more acid, but how? Maybe by excreting H+ into urine. Alternatively, if the blood is too basic, they might excrete more bicarbonate, but I'm not sure.

Option C says they maintain constant production regardless of needs. That doesn't sound right because the body's needs can vary, so the kidneys probably adjust based on that.

Option D says they produce H+ ions to maintain balance. But the body's own processes, like metabolism, produce H+ ions. The kidneys might help in excreting them, not necessarily producing them.

Option E says eliminate all H+ ions. No, because the body needs some H+; it's about regulating, not eliminating all.

Option F suggests kidneys detect H+ levels and signal others. I think the kidneys don't detect levels; the detection is done by other systems, like the buffer systems in the blood. The kidneys respond to signals, maybe from the blood pH, to adjust their excretion.

Option G says release enzymes to neutralize H+. I don't recall the kidneys releasing enzymes for this; they process ions through filtration and reabsorption.

Option H converts H+ into inert gases. That sounds unlikely; I don't think H+ is converted into gases like CO2, which is more related to the lungs.

Option I says they store H+ ions. I don't think that's a major function; the kidneys are about excreting and reabsorbing, not storing.

Option J says absorb all H+ to prevent affecting pH. That can't be right because the body needs some H+ in the blood, and the kidneys can't absorb all of them.

So, back to option B: the kidneys regulate by excreting either acidic or basic constituents. So when the body's pH is too low (acidic), the kidneys excrete more acid, which means more H+ ions in the urine. Conversely, when the pH is too high (basic), they might retain more H+ or excrete more bicarbonate. That makes sense because the kidneys are a major player in acid-base balance, along with the lungs.

Wait, but don't the lungs handle CO2 which is related to acidity? Yes, the lungs excrete CO2, which is a product of cellular respiration and contributes to H+ ions when dissolved in blood. But the kidneys handle the ions more directly through urine.

So the correct answer should be B. The kidneys adjust the excretion of acidic or basic components based on the body's needs to regulate H+ concentration.

The kidneys play a crucial role in regulating hydrogen ion concentration to maintain the body's pH balance. They achieve this by excreting either acidic or basic constituents depending on whether the hydrogen ion levels deviate from the normal range. This ensures that the extracellular fluid's pH remains stable, which is essential for bodily functions. 

Answer: B
