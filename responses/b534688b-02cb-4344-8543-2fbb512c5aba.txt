Question:

Each student that enrolls at a school is assigned a unique ID number, which is stored as a binary number. The ID numbers increase sequentially by 1 with each newly enrolled student. If the ID number assigned to the last student who enrolled was the binary number 1001 0011, what binary number will be assigned to the next student who enrolls?

Options:

A: 1001 0110
B: 1101 0100
C: 1001 0101
D: 1101 0111
E: 1001 1000
F: 1001 0010
G: 1001 0100
H: 1001 0111
I: 1101 0011
J: 1011 0100

Okay, so I have this question about binary numbers, right? Let's try to figure it out step by step. 

The question says that each student gets a unique ID number stored as a binary. These IDs increase by 1 each time a new student enrolls. The last ID assigned was 1001 0011 in binary. I need to find what the next ID will be.

First, I should probably convert the binary number to decimal to make it easier to add one. Binary to decimal conversion is something I remember involves each digit representing a power of two, starting from the right.

So, the binary number is 1001 0011. Let me break it down:

From right to left, the positions are 0 to 7 (since it's 8 bits). So each bit is:

1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the binary is written as 1001 0011, which is 8 bits. Let me write them out:

Positions (right to left, starting at 0):

Bit 7: 1
Bit 6: 0
Bit 5: 0
Bit 4: 1
Bit 3: 0
Bit 2: 0
Bit 1: 1
Bit 0: 1

Wait, no, actually, the way it's written, 1001 0011 is split into two parts, but each is four bits. So let's write each digit:

First part: 1001, second part: 0011. But when considering as an 8-bit number, it's 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1.

Wait, no, perhaps I should write it as 1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1. Let me make sure. So the binary number is 10010011. Let me count the digits: 1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1. That's 8 bits.

So to convert to decimal:

- The leftmost bit is the 7th position (since we start counting from 0 on the right). So each bit's value is 2^position.

Calculating each bit:

Bit 7: 1 * 2^7 = 128
Bit 6: 0 * 2^6 = 0
Bit 5: 0 * 2^5 = 0
Bit 4: 1 * 2^4 = 16
Bit 3: 0 * 2^3 = 0
Bit 2: 0 * 2^2 = 0
Bit 1: 1 * 2^1 = 2
Bit 0: 1 * 2^0 = 1

Adding them up: 128 + 16 + 2 + 1 = 147.

So the last ID is 147 in decimal. The next student's ID should be 147 + 1 = 148.

Now, I need to convert 148 back to binary to find the next ID.

Let me do the conversion step by step.

To convert decimal to binary, I can divide the number by 2 and keep track of the remainders.

148 divided by 2 is 74, remainder 0.

74 divided by 2 is 37, remainder 0.

37 divided by 2 is 18, remainder 1.

18 divided by 2 is 9, remainder 0.

9 divided by 2 is 4, remainder 1.

4 divided by 2 is 2, remainder 0.

2 divided by 2 is 1, remainder 0.

1 divided by 2 is 0, remainder 1.

Now, writing the remainders from last to first: 10010100.

Wait, let me check the remainders again:

Wait, starting from the last division:

1: remainder 1

2: remainder 0

4: remainder 0

9: remainder 1

18: remainder 0

37: remainder 1

74: remainder 0

148: remainder 0

Wait, that seems off. Let me write each step:

148 /2 =74, rem 0

74 /2=37, rem 0

37 /2=18, rem 1

18 /2=9, rem 0

9 /2=4, rem 1

4 /2=2, rem 0

2 /2=1, rem 0

1 /2=0, rem 1.

So the remainders, from last to first, are 1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0.

Wait, no. Wait, the first division gives the least significant bit (rightmost), and each subsequent division gives the next bit to the left. So the remainders, in order of division, are:

148→0, 74→0, 37→1, 18→0, 9→1, 4→0, 2→0, 1→1.

So when you write the binary number, you take the remainders in reverse order, starting from the last division.

So the remainders in order from last to first are:

1 (from 1/2), then 0 (2/2), 0 (4/2), 1 (9/2), 0 (18/2), 1 (37/2), 0 (74/2), 0 (148/2).

Wait, that's confusing. Let me list the remainders in the order they were obtained:

148 → rem 0 (LSB)

74 → rem 0

37 → rem 1

18 → rem 0

9 → rem 1

4 → rem 0

2 → rem 0

1 → rem 1 (MSB)

So the binary number is built from the last division to the first. So the first remainder is the LSB, and the last is the MSB.

So the binary number is 10010100.

Wait, let me check:

10010100 in binary is:

1*(2^7)=128

0*(2^6)=0

0*(2^5)=0

1*(2^4)=16

0*(2^3)=0

1*(2^2)=4

0*(2^1)=0

0*(2^0)=0

Adding up: 128 +16 +4 =148. Yes, that's correct.

So the next ID is 10010100 in binary.

Now, looking at the options:

A: 1001 0110 → 10010110

B: 1101 0100 → 11010100

C: 1001 0101 → 10010101

D: 1101 0111 → 11010111

E: 1001 1000 → 10011000

F: 1001 0010 → 10010010

G: 1001 0100 → 10010100

H: 1001 0111 → 10010111

I: 1101 0011 → 11010011

J: 1011 0100 → 10110100

Wait, the correct binary is 10010100, which matches option G.

So the correct answer should be G.

The next student's ID is 10010100 in binary, which corresponds to option G.
