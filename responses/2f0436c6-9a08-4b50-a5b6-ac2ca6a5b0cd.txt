Question:

A college student and her boyfriend lived together in a one-bedroom apartment in Los Angeles. They were engaged to be married when they purchased an undeveloped parcel of land on a hillside overlooking the Pacific. The deed, which was properly executed and recorded, named the student and the boyfriend as grantees, "not as tenants in common but as joint tenants with right of survivorship. "Thereafter, the boyfriend, who was experiencing financial difficulties, offered to sell the property to his co-worker. Without the student's knowledge, the boyfriend executed a deed that purported to convey the hillside property to the co-worker in fee simple. The boyfriend signed his name and forged the student's name. He then delivered the deed of conveyance to the co-worker, who paid the boyfriend $150,000, which was the fair market value of the property. The co-worker immediately recorded the deed received from the boyfriend. The common law joint tenancy is unmodified by statute. Title to the property in question is now in

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out who owns the property now. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the student and her boyfriend bought a parcel of land together. The deed says they're joint tenants with the right of survivorship. I remember that joint tenancy means they each own the entire property, and if one dies, the other automatically gets it. It's different from tenants in common, where each owns a specific share. So at the beginning, the student and boyfriend own it as joint tenants.

Then, the boyfriend, who's having financial trouble, decides to sell the property to his co-worker without telling the student. He forges her name on the deed and sells it for the fair market value of $150,000. He then delivers the deed to the co-worker, who records it.

Hmm, so the question is about the validity of this sale. At common law, joint tenants have an equal right to the property, and neither can dispose of the entire property without the other's consent. So if one joint tenant sells the property, does that sale hold up?

I think when a joint tenant sells without the other's consent, the sale is generally ineffective because the other has a right of survivorship. So the co-worker might not get good title because the boyfriend couldn't unilaterally transfer the property. But wait, the deed was recorded, so maybe there's a recording act consideration here. But the recording act usually protects bona fide purchasers, but the co-worker here bought it for fair value and recorded it. However, the issue is whether the boyfriend had the authority to sell.

In joint tenancy, each can transfer their own interest, but not the whole. So if the boyfriend tried to convey the entire property, that's a problem. He can only transfer his own interest, not the student's. So the co-worker might only get the boyfriend's half, but the student's half remains with her. But at common law, joint tenancy doesn't allow one to transfer more than their own share. So if the boyfriend tried to convey the whole, the transfer would be ineffective as to the student's interest.

Wait, but the deed was to the co-worker in fee simple. The boyfriend can't convey more than he owns. So the co-worker would only get the boyfriend's half, but since the student is still a joint tenant, she would have the right of survivorship. So when the boyfriend dies, she would take his half. But if the boyfriend is alive, the co-worker's deed is only valid for the boyfriend's interest, but the student's interest remains.

Wait, but if the boyfriend forges the student's signature, does that make the deed valid? No, because she didn't agree. So the co-worker took the deed without the student's knowledge or consent. So the deed from the boyfriend alone isn't enough because the student is a necessary party in a joint tenancy.

At common law, a joint tenant can't transfer the entire property without the other's consent. So the sale is ineffective as to the student's interest. Therefore, the co-worker can't get the entire property. The student's interest remains, and the boyfriend's attempted sale doesn't affect it.

So the title would still be with the student and boyfriend as joint tenants, right? Because the sale didn't legally transfer the property from the student's side. The co-worker might have an interest from the boyfriend, but since the boyfriend couldn't transfer the whole, the co-worker doesn't get the whole property.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Option C says the boyfriend and student as joint tenants. Option J says the student as owner in fee simple. Option I says the boyfriend as owner. Option B says the co-worker as owner. Option F says co-worker and boyfriend as joint tenants.

But under common law, if the sale is ineffective, the title remains with the original joint tenants. So the correct answer would be C, the student and boyfriend as joint tenants.

Wait, but the boyfriend attempted to convey the property, but since he didn't have the authority, the co-worker doesn't get it. So the property is still owned by the student and boyfriend as joint tenants.

But wait, the co-worker paid fair market value and recorded. Does that make a difference? In some states, a bona fide purchaser (BFP) would take the property despite prior claims, but at common law, joint tenancy doesn't allow for a BFP to take because the right of survivorship is absolute. However, the recording act might protect a BFP who pays value and records without notice. But here, the co-worker didn't know about the joint tenancy? Or did he? The question says the boyfriend forged the name, so the co-worker didn't know and had no notice. So under the recording act, a BFP would get title, but only if the transfer is valid.

Wait, but the issue is whether the transfer is valid. The boyfriend couldn't convey the entire property without the student's consent. So the co-worker, even as a BFP, can't get the property because the transfer was ineffective as to the student's interest. So the co-worker would only get the boyfriend's interest, but since the student is still a joint tenant, the property remains as joint tenancy.

Wait, but in reality, when a joint tenant transfers their interest, the joint tenancy is severed, and they become tenants in common. But that's when one of them transfers their own interest. For example, if the boyfriend sells his own interest, the joint tenancy is severed, and each holds as tenants in common. So the co-worker would then own the boyfriend's share, and the student owns her share as a tenant in common.

But in this case, the boyfriend tried to convey the entire property, not just his share. So perhaps the transfer is ineffective, and the joint tenancy remains intact. But I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, if the boyfriend transfers his interest, even without the other's consent, the joint tenancy is severed, and they become tenants in common. So the boyfriend's share is now his to transfer, and the co-worker would get that share as a tenant in common, while the student has her own share. But wait, the deed was in fee simple, so the boyfriend tried to transfer the whole.

Wait, no. If they were joint tenants, each owns the entire estate as joint tenants. So when the boyfriend transfers his interest, whether it's by sale or gift, he can only transfer his own interest, not the whole. So if he sells his interest, the joint tenancy is severed, and they become tenants in common, each owning a 50% interest. Then, the co-worker would own the boyfriend's 50%, and the student would own her 50%.

But in this case, the boyfriend tried to convey the entire property, not just his interest. So perhaps the transfer is ineffective as to the student's interest, meaning the property remains as joint tenancy between the student and boyfriend, and the co-worker's deed is invalid. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the boyfriend's transfer of the entire property, even if he only owns half, would still transfer his half, and the co-worker would own that half, making them tenants in common with the student.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let me look again.

Option E: co-worker and student as joint tenants. No, because the student didn't agree.

Option G: co-worker and student as tenants in common. That could be the case if the joint tenancy was severed.

But the initial deed was joint tenancy, and if the boyfriend transferred his interest without the student's consent, the joint tenancy is severed, and they become tenants in common. Then, the co-worker would own the boyfriend's share, making the ownership between the co-worker and the student as tenants in common.

But wait, the deed was from the boyfriend alone, for the entire property. So perhaps the co-worker only gets the boyfriend's half, and the student's half remains. So the property would be owned as tenants in common by the co-worker and the student.

Looking at the options, option G says that. But wait, the initial deed was joint tenancy. If the boyfriend transfers his interest, the joint tenancy is severed, so they become tenants in common. Then, the co-worker owns the boyfriend's share, and the student owns her share. So the property is owned by the co-worker and the student as tenants in common.

But the co-worker paid $150,000, which is the fair market value. So he's a bona fide purchaser. But at common law, the joint tenancy's right of survivorship would mean that if the student is still alive, her interest remains. But the co-worker bought from the boyfriend, who only had the right to transfer his own interest.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to outline:

1. Initial ownership: Student and BF as joint tenants with right of survivorship.

2. BF sells his interest to Co-worker without student's consent, forging her name.

   a. At common law, a joint tenant can transfer their own interest, which severs the joint tenancy, making them tenants in common.

   b. So BF's transfer of his interest would sever the joint tenancy, and each would own 50% as tenants in common.

   c. Co-worker buys BF's 50%, so now Co-worker and Student are tenants in common.

But wait, the deed was in fee simple, so BF tried to convey the entire property. But he couldn't do that because he only owned a 50% interest as a tenant in common after the transfer. Or did he?

Wait, no. Before any transfer, they were joint tenants. When BF transfers his interest, the joint tenancy is severed, making them tenants in common. So when BF sells his 50% to Co-worker, Co-worker gets 50%, and Student keeps her 50%.

But the question is whether the transfer is valid. BF forged the student's name, so the deed from BF alone is invalid as to the student's interest. So the transfer only affects BF's interest, but the student's remains. So Co-worker gets BF's 50%, and Student has her 50%, making them tenants in common.

But wait, the initial deed was joint tenancy. If BF transfers without consent, the joint tenancy is severed, making them tenants in common. So Co-worker buys BF's 50%, so the ownership is Co-worker (50%) and Student (50%) as tenants in common.

Looking at the options, option G says "the co-worker and the student as tenants in common." That would be correct.

But wait, the student didn't consent, and the deed was forged. So the transfer from BF alone is ineffective as to the student's interest. So the joint tenancy isn't severed because the transfer was ineffective. So the property remains as joint tenants, and the Co-worker's deed is invalid.

Hmm, I'm not sure. At common law, a joint tenant can transfer their interest, which severs the joint tenancy, regardless of the other's consent. So even if the student didn't agree, the transfer would sever the joint tenancy, making them tenants in common. Then, Co-worker would own BF's share, and Student owns her share.

But the issue is whether the transfer was valid. Since BF forged the student's name, the deed is invalid as to her interest. So the transfer only affects BF's interest, which he could legally transfer, severing the joint tenancy. So Co-worker owns BF's 50%, and Student owns her 50% as tenants in common.

So the correct answer would be G: the co-worker and the student as tenants in common.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Some sources say that a joint tenant can transfer their interest, which severs the joint tenancy, making them tenants in common. So even if the other joint tenant doesn't consent, the transfer is valid as to the transferring party's interest. Therefore, the Co-worker would own the BF's 50%, and the Student owns her 50%, as tenants in common.

So the answer would be G.

The property was initially owned by the student and her boyfriend as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. Under common law, a joint tenant can transfer their interest without the consent of the other joint tenant, which severs the joint tenancy and converts the ownership into tenancy in common. The boyfriend, facing financial difficulties, forged the student's name and executed a deed conveying the property to the co-worker for $150,000, which was the fair market value. Although the deed was invalid as to the student's interest due to the forgery, the transfer of the boyfriend's interest was still effective. This severed the joint tenancy, making the student and the co-worker tenants in common, each owning a 50% interest in the property. The co-worker's recording of the deed protects their interest under the recording act, but it does not affect the student's ownership. Therefore, the property is now owned by the co-worker and the student as tenants in common.
