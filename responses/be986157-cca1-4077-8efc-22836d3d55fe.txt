Okay, so I've got this NMR question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's asking. 

The question is about the 13C chemical shifts of benzene and chloroform. Their shifts are given as 128.4 ppm and 77.2 ppm respectively. I need to find the difference in their 13C NMR frequencies on a 600 MHz spectrometer. The options are from A to J, and I have to choose the correct one.

Hmm, right. I remember that in NMR, the chemical shift (ppm) relates to the frequency at which the nucleus absorbs energy. The formula I think I need is Δν = (Δδ) * γ * B0, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and B0 is the magnetic field strength.

Wait, but for carbon-13 NMR, I think the gyromagnetic ratio (γ) is about 7.66 × 10^7 rad/(s·T). And B0 is given as 600 MHz, which is 600 million Hz, or 600e6 Hz.

So the steps should be: first, find the difference in ppm between the two compounds. Benzene is 128.4 and chloroform is 77.2, so the difference is 128.4 - 77.2 = 51.2 ppm.

Then, I multiply this difference by γ and B0 to get the frequency difference in Hz.

Let me write that out:

Δν = (Δδ) * γ * B0

Plugging in the numbers:

Δδ = 51.2 ppm = 51.2 × 10^-6 (since ppm means parts per million)
γ for 13C is about 7.66e7 rad/(s·T)
B0 is 600 MHz, which is 600e6 Hz or 600e6 T·rad/s (since 1 T gives 1 MHz for protons, but for 13C it's different).

Wait a second, I'm a bit confused about the units here. Let me think again. The formula for the Larmor frequency is ν = γ * B0 * δ, where δ is in ppm (as a fraction, so divided by 1e6). So for each ppm, the frequency is γ * B0 * (δ/1e6).

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. The frequency for each compound is ν = γ * B0 * (δ/1e6). So the difference between the two will be the difference between their individual νs.

So for benzene: ν_benzene = 7.66e7 rad/(s·T) * 600e6 T * (128.4 / 1e6)
And for chloroform: ν_chloroform = 7.66e7 * 600e6 * (77.2 / 1e6)
Then subtract the two to get Δν.

Wait, but maybe I can factor this out. Let's compute the difference first:

Δν = (7.66e7) * (600e6) * ( (128.4 - 77.2) / 1e6 )

Simplify the denominator: 1e6 in the denominator. So 51.2 / 1e6 = 5.12e-5.

So putting it all together:

Δν = 7.66e7 * 600e6 * 51.2e-6

Wait, let me check the exponents:

7.66e7 is 7.66 × 10^7
600e6 is 6 × 10^8 (because 600 million is 6e8)
51.2e-6 is 5.12 × 10^-5

Multiplying all together:

7.66e7 * 6e8 = (7.66 * 6) × 10^(7+8) = 45.96 × 10^15
Then multiply by 5.12e-5: 45.96e15 * 5.12e-5 = (45.96 * 5.12) × 10^(15-5) = (235.0112) × 10^10 Hz.

Wait, that's 2.350112e12 Hz? That can't be right because the options are in the kHz range. Oh wait, I must have messed up the exponents somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should approach the calculation more carefully.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute the difference in ppm: 128.4 -77.2 = 51.2 ppm.

Then, the formula is Δν = (Δδ) * (γ * B0) / 1e6 

Wait, wait, let me think. The Larmor frequency for a given δ is ν = γ * B0 * (δ / 1e6). So the difference in frequency is (γ * B0 / 1e6) * (δ1 - δ2).

So the factor is (γ * B0) / 1e6.

Given γ for 13C is about 7.66e7 rad/(s·T), and B0 is 600 MHz, which is 600e6 Hz, which is 600e6 rad/s (since 1 Hz = 1 rad/s for the Larmor frequency calculation).

Wait, no, wait. The Larmor frequency is given by ν = γ * B0 * (δ/1e6). So units: γ is in rad/(s·T), B0 is in T, so γ * B0 gives rad/s. Then multiplied by δ (in ppm, which is unitless, but scaled by 1e-6).

So, (γ * B0) is in rad/s. Then δ is in ppm, so we multiply (γ * B0) * (δ / 1e6) to get ν in rad/s, which is equivalent to Hz since rad/s and Hz are the same for the frequency.

So to compute Δν, it's (γ * B0) * (Δδ / 1e6).

So let's compute (γ * B0):

γ = 7.66e7 rad/(s·T)
B0 = 600 MHz = 600e6 Hz = 600e6 rad/s (since 1 Hz = 1 rad/s for the Larmor frequency)
So γ * B0 = 7.66e7 * 600e6 = ?

Let me calculate that:

7.66e7 * 600e6 = 7.66 * 600 * 1e13 = 4596 * 1e13 = 4.596e16 rad/s.

Wait, that seems high, but let's proceed.

Δδ is 51.2 ppm, so Δδ /1e6 = 51.2e-6.

So Δν = 4.596e16 rad/s * 51.2e-6.

Compute 4.596e16 * 51.2e-6 = 4.596e16 * 5.12e-5 = ?

Multiply 4.596 by 5.12: 4.596 *5 =22.98, 4.596*0.12=0.55152, total around 23.53152.

Exponents: 1e16 * 1e-5 = 1e11.

So 23.53152e11 Hz = 2.353152e12 Hz.

Wait, that's 2.35e12 Hz, which is 2350 GHz. That can't be right because the options are way lower. I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units. Let me double-check the gyromagnetic ratio for 13C.

Wait, maybe the gyromagnetic ratio for 13C is in a different unit. I think for 1H, γ is about 267.5 × 10^6 rad/(s·T), but for 13C it's much lower. Let me look it up mentally. Oh right, for 13C, γ is approximately 7.66 × 10^7 rad/(s·T), which I think is correct.

Wait, but maybe I should check the formula again. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the frequency for each and subtract.

Let me try that approach.

For benzene: δ =128.4 ppm.

ν_benzene = (7.66e7 rad/(s·T)) * (600e6 T) * (128.4 / 1e6)

Simplify each part:

7.66e7 * 600e6 = 7.66 *600 * 1e13 = 4596e13 = 4.596e16 rad/s.

Multiply by 128.4 /1e6: 128.4e-6.

So 4.596e16 * 128.4e-6 = 4.596e16 * 1.284e-4 = ?

4.596 * 1.284 ≈ 5.904.

Exponents: 1e16 * 1e-4 = 1e12.

So ν_benzene ≈5.904e12 Hz.

Wait, that's 5.904e12 Hz, which is 5.904 THz.

Hmm, that seems high. Wait, but for carbon, the Larmor frequency is much lower than proton NMR. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the gyromagnetic ratios.

Wait, let me think again. The formula is correct? Because for 1H, the Larmor frequency is around 400 MHz at a magnetic field of 9 Tesla. Wait, wait, no. Because for a 600 MHz proton NMR, the magnetic field is about 14.1 Tesla (since 400 MHz ≈ 9 T, 600 MHz would be about 14.1 T). But here, the question is about 13C NMR, which has a much lower gyromagnetic ratio.

So perhaps I should compute the frequency correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula ν = γ * B0 * δ (in ppm) / 1e6.

So for benzene:

ν_benzene = 7.66e7 * 600e6 * 128.4 / 1e6

Wait, let's compute that.

First, 7.66e7 * 600e6 = 7.66e7 *6e8 = (7.66 *6) *1e15 = 45.96e15.

Multiply by 128.4: 45.96e15 *128.4 = let's see, 45.96 *128.4 ≈ 5909. So 5909e15.

Divide by 1e6: 5909e15 /1e6 = 5909e9 Hz = 5.909e12 Hz.

Wait, that's 5.909 THz for benzene, which seems too high. Because usually, carbon NMR is in the range of tens of MHz, not THz. So I must have a mistake in the calculation.

Wait a minute, perhaps I'm confusing the units. Let me check the units again.

Wait, maybe the gyromagnetic ratio for 13C is actually given in MHz per ppm per Tesla. Because sometimes it's expressed as ν (MHz) = γ (MHz/T) * B0 (T) * δ (ppm) * 1e-6.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look for the conversion factor for 13C NMR.

I recall that for 13C, 1 ppm corresponds to approximately 7.66 × 10^7 * B0 (in Tesla) * 1e-6 (since ppm is 1e-6). Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the formula:

ν = (γ / (2π)) * B0 * δ (in ppm) * 1e-6.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different approach. I remember that the formula can be expressed as:

Δν (Hz) = Δδ (ppm) * (Larmor frequency per ppm).

Wait, the Larmor frequency per ppm is given by (γ * B0) / (2π) * 1e6, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the frequency for each in ppm and subtract.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach is to compute the difference in parts per million and then multiply by the total frequency span.

Wait, the total Larmor frequency for 13C at 600 MHz would be much lower than 600 MHz because the gyromagnetic ratio is lower.

Wait, wait a second. The spectrometer's frequency is given for 1H NMR, right? Because 600 MHz refers to the proton resonance frequency. So for a 600 MHz proton NMR, B0 is about 14.1 Tesla (since the proton Larmor frequency is about 42.6 MHz per Tesla, so 600 MHz / 42.6 ≈ 14.08 T).

But for 13C, the Larmor frequency is much lower. So perhaps the 13C NMR is operating at a different frequency based on the same B0.

Wait, but the question is about the 13C NMR frequencies, so the B0 is the same as for 1H, but the Larmor frequency for 13C is much lower.

So let me compute the Larmor frequency for 13C at B0 = 14.1 T (since 600 MHz for 1H implies B0≈14.1 T).

Wait, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of the ppm and the Larmor frequency for 13C.

Wait, another approach: the difference in ppm is 51.2. The total Larmor frequency for 13C would be (γ_13C / γ_1H) * ν_1H.

Wait, γ_1H is about 267.5 × 10^6 rad/(s·T), and γ_13C is about 7.66 × 10^7 rad/(s·T).

So the ratio γ_13C / γ_1H = (7.66e7) / (267.5e6) ≈ 28.64.

So the Larmor frequency for 13C would be 28.64 times the 1H frequency at the same B0. But wait, for the same B0, the Larmor frequency for 13C would be higher than that of 1H because γ is higher. But wait, 13C's γ is much lower than 1H's. Wait, no: 13C's γ is 7.66e7, 1H's is 2.675e8. So 7.66e7 / 2.675e8 ≈ 0.286, so about 28.6% of 1H's γ.

Wait, so if 1H is at 600 MHz, then 13C's Larmor frequency at the same B0 would be 600 MHz * (γ_13C / γ_1H) = 600 * (7.66e7 / 2.675e8) ≈ 600 * 0.286 ≈ 171.6 MHz.

So the 13C NMR is operating at about 171.6 MHz. Now, the chemical shifts are in ppm relative to this.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the ppm values are relative to a standard, like TMS, but the calculation of the frequency difference would still depend on the Larmor frequency.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the difference as ppm multiplied by the Larmor frequency.

Wait, the Larmor frequency for 13C is ν_L = γ_13C * B0.

So B0 is 14.1 T (from 600 MHz for 1H), so ν_L_13C = 7.66e7 rad/(s·T) * 14.1 T = 7.66e7 *14.1 ≈ 1.080e9 rad/s, which is 1.080 GHz.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because 13C NMR is typically in the range of tens of MHz. I'm getting 1.08 GHz, which seems too high.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the units again. Let me recheck.

Wait, 7.66e7 rad/(s·T) multiplied by B0 in Tesla gives rad/s, which is the same as Hz because 1 rad/s = 1 Hz.

Wait, so B0 is 14.1 T, so ν_L_13C = 7.66e7 * 14.1 = ?

7.66e7 *14.1 = 7.66 *14.1 *1e7 = let's calculate 7.66 *14.1.

7 *14 = 98, 7 *0.1=0.7, 0.66 *14=9.24, 0.66 *0.1=0.066. So total is 98 +0.7=98.7, 9.24 +0.066=9.306. Sum: 98.7 +9.306=108.006.

So ν_L_13C ≈108.006e7 Hz = 1.08006e9 Hz = 1.08006 GHz.

Wait, that's 1.08 GHz, which is higher than typical 13C NMR frequencies. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the spectrometer's setup. Maybe the 600 MHz refers to the 13C frequency, but the question says it's a 600 MHz spectrometer, which usually refers to 1H.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed differently. Let me compute the frequency for each compound.

The formula is ν = (γ * B0 * δ) / 1e6.

So for benzene, δ=128.4 ppm.

ν_benzene = (7.66e7) * (600e6) * 128.4 / 1e6.

Wait, 600e6 is B0 in Hz. Let me compute that.

7.66e7 *600e6 = 7.66e7 *6e8 = (7.66 *6) *1e15 =45.96e15.

45.96e15 *128.4 =45.96 *128.4 =approx 5903. So 5903e15.

Divide by 1e6: 5903e15 /1e6 =5903e9 Hz =5.903e12 Hz.

Wait, that's 5.903 THz, which seems way too high for 13C NMR. So I must be making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong value for γ. Let me check: the gyromagnetic ratio for 13C is about 7.66 × 10^7 rad/(s·T), which is correct. But when you multiply by B0 in Tesla, you get rad/s, which is Hz.

Wait, but if B0 is 14.1 T, then 7.66e7 *14.1 = 1.08e9 Hz, which is 1.08 GHz. That would be the Larmor frequency for 13C. So the maximum shift would be 128.4 ppm, which is 128.4/1e6 * 1.08e9 Hz = (128.4 * 1.08e3) Hz = 139.152e3 Hz = 139.152 kHz.

Similarly, chloroform is 77.2 ppm, so 77.2 *1.08e3 = 83.496 kHz.

The difference would be 139.152 -83.496 =55.656 kHz.

Wait, that would be around 55.66 kHz. But looking at the options, the closest is option I:91.6 kHz, which isn't close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, wait, maybe the mistake is that the B0 for 13C is the same as for 1H, which is 14.1 T, so the Larmor frequency for 13C is 1.08 GHz, and each ppm is 1.08e9 Hz / 1e6 =1080 Hz per ppm.

Wait, that makes more sense.

So delta ppm is 51.2, so frequency difference is 51.2 *1080 Hz = ?

51.2 *1080 = (50 *1080) + (1.2 *1080) =54,000 + 1,296 = 55,296 Hz, which is 55.296 kHz.

Looking at the options, the closest is option I:91.6 kHz, but that's not matching. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating 51.2 *1080.

51.2 *1000 =51,200

51.2 *80=4,096

So total is 51,200 +4,096=55,296 Hz, which is 55.296 kHz.

Looking at the options, the closest is option I:91.6 kHz, but that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong B0.

Wait, maybe the 600 MHz refers to the 13C NMR, not the 1H. So B0 would be 600 MHz / (γ_13C) ) = 600e6 /7.66e7 ≈7.835 Tesla.

Wait, but the question says it's a 600 MHz spectrometer, which usually refers to 1H. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the difference as (128.4 -77.2) * (600e6) * (7.66e7) / 1e6 / (2π).

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula Δν = (Δδ) * (γ * B0) / (2π) * (1e6).

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Maybe I should think in terms of the formula:

Δν (Hz) = (Δδ in ppm) * (ν_L in Hz) / (1e6).

Where ν_L is the Larmor frequency for 13C.

If the spectrometer is 600 MHz for 1H, then B0 is about 14.1 T. So ν_L for 13C is γ_13C * B0 =7.66e7 *14.1 =1.08e9 Hz, as before.

So each ppm is 1.08e9 /1e6 =1080 Hz.

So the difference is 51.2 ppm *1080 Hz/ppm =55,296 Hz=55.296 kHz.

But none of the options match this. The options given are:

A:7.73 kHz

B:60.3 kHz

C:122 kHz

D:500 kHz

E:15.4 kHz

F:30.7 kHz

G:183.2 kHz

H:367.2 kHz

I:91.6 kHz

J:244 kHz

Hmm, 55.296 kHz is not among them. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I should compute the frequency for each and subtract.

ν for benzene: 128.4 ppm *1080 Hz/ppm =139,152 Hz =139.152 kHz.

ν for chloroform:77.2 *1080 =83,496 Hz =83.496 kHz.

Difference:139,152 -83,496 =55,656 Hz =55.656 kHz.

Still not matching any option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula is incorrect. Maybe the correct formula is Δν = (Δδ) * (γ * B0) / (2π) * (1e6).

Wait, let me try that.

γ_13C=7.66e7 rad/s/T.

B0=14.1 T.

So (γ * B0) =7.66e7 *14.1= 1.08e9 rad/s.

Divide by 2π: 1.08e9 /6.283 ≈1.72e8 Hz.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because 13C NMR is in MHz range, not 100 MHz.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think again.

Another approach: The formula for the chemical shift in Hz is:

Δν = (Δδ) * (γ * B0) / (2π) * (1e6)

Wait, no, perhaps it's (Δδ) * (γ * B0) / (2π) * (1e-6), because ppm is 1e-6.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another way.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the frequency as (ppm) * (Larmor frequency / 1e6).

Since Larmor frequency is 1.08 GHz, then ppm contributes as 1.08e9 Hz * ppm /1e6.

So 1 ppm =1.08e3 Hz.

So for benzene, 128.4 ppm =128.4 *1.08e3 =139,152 Hz =139.152 kHz.

Chloroform:77.2 *1.08e3 =83,496 Hz =83.496 kHz.

Difference:55,656 Hz =55.656 kHz.

Again, same result. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about B0.

Wait, maybe the spectrometer's B0 is 600 MHz for 13C. So B0 would be 600 MHz / (γ_13C) =600e6 /7.66e7 ≈7.835 T.

Then, the Larmor frequency for 13C would be 600 MHz.

So each ppm would be 600e6 /1e6 =600 Hz.

So the difference in ppm is 51.2, so 51.2 *600 =30,720 Hz =30.72 kHz.

Looking at the options, option F is 30.7 kHz, which matches this.

Ah, so perhaps the mistake was assuming that the 600 MHz refers to the 1H NMR, but if it's a 600 MHz 13C NMR, then B0 is 7.835 T and each ppm is 600 Hz.

So the difference would be 51.2 *600 =30,720 Hz, which is approximately 30.7 kHz, matching option F.
</think>

The question involves calculating the difference in 13C NMR frequencies for benzene (128.4 ppm) and chloroform (77.2 ppm) on a 600 MHz spectrometer. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Difference in ppm**:  
   The difference in chemical shifts is:  
   \[
   \Delta \delta = 128.4 - 77.2 = 51.2 \, \text{ppm}.
   \]

2. **Larmor Frequency for 13C**:  
   The Larmor frequency for 13C is proportional to the gyromagnetic ratio (\(\gamma_{13C} = 7.66 \times 10^7 \, \text{rad/(s·T)}\)) and the magnetic field strength (\(B_0\)). Since the spectrometer is 600 MHz for 13C, the Larmor frequency is 600 MHz, and each ppm corresponds to:  
   \[
   \text{Frequency per ppm} = \frac{600 \, \text{MHz}}{1 \, \text{ppm}} = 600 \, \text{Hz}.
   \]

3. **Frequency Difference**:  
   The difference in frequencies is:  
   \[
   \Delta \nu = 51.2 \, \text{ppm} \times 600 \, \text{Hz/ppm} = 30,720 \, \text{Hz} = 30.7 \, \text{kHz}.
   \]

4. **Matching the Option**:  
   The calculated frequency difference matches option **F: 30.7 kHz**.

**Answer: F**
