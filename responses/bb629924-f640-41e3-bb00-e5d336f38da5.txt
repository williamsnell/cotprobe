Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what the phrase "Guru-Panth" means in Sikh traditions. I'm not too familiar with Sikhism, but I know a bit about it. Let's break it down.

First, the word "Guru" I recognize as a teacher or guide, someone who imparts wisdom. In many religions, a guru is a spiritual teacher. So that part makes sense.

Now, "Panth" is a term I'm less familiar with. I think it's a Sanskrit word, and in some contexts, it refers to a community or a group that follows a particular path or teaching. So, putting "Guru" and "Panth" together, it might refer to a community that follows the teachings of a guru.

In Sikhism, I remember that they have a concept of the Guru, not just an individual teacher, but also a collective or a path. The Sikh Gurus are a series of teachers, starting with Guru Nanak and ending with Guru Gobind Singh. After that, the Adi Granth, which is their holy book, became the perpetual Guru. So, maybe "Guru-Panth" refers to this collective wisdom or the community that follows the Guru's teachings.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. Option A is "Spiritual journey." That sounds more like an individual path, not necessarily a community. Option B is "Sacred hymn," which doesn't seem to fit because Guru-Panth is about the community, not a hymn. Option C is "Community," which seems possible. Option D is "Apprenticeship," which is more about learning from a teacher, but I don't think that's what Guru-Panth means. Option E is "Scripture," which is related to the Adi Granth, but not exactly the community. Option F is "Ritual practices," which are part of the religion but not the term for the community. Option G is "Worship," which is a practice but not the same as the term. Option H is "Divine guidance," which is more about the teachings but not the community aspect. Option I is "Teacher-student relationship," which is part of the guru concept but not the entire community. Option J is "Path of enlightenment," which is a broader concept but not specific to the community.

So, considering all that, I think the best fit is Option C: Community. Guru-Panth refers to the community of Sikhs who follow the teachings of the Guru. It's about the collective aspect rather than just the individual teacher or the teachings themselves.

The phrase "Guru-Panth" in Sikh traditions refers to the community of Sikhs who follow the teachings of the Guru. It emphasizes the collective aspect of the faith, where the Guru is not just an individual teacher but also a guiding principle followed by the community.
