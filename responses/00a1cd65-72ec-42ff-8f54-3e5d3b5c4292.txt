Okay, so I have this question here: Which crop began the Third Agricultural Revolution? The options are A through I, with various grains listed. Hmm, I remember that the Third Agricultural Revolution is sometimes referred to as the Green Revolution. I think it started in the mid-20th century, right? The Green Revolution was all about increasing agricultural productivity through the use of technology, fertilizers, pesticides, and better crop breeds.

Wait, but the question is about which crop started this revolution. I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. I know that corn, also known as maize, was a major crop in the Green Revolution. They developed high-yield varieties of corn that were more resistant to pests and diseases. These hybrid crops helped increase food production significantly, especially in places like Mexico and the United States.

Let me think about the other options. Wheat, rye, oats, barley, millet, and rice are all ancient crops that have been around for a long time. Quinoa is an interesting one, but I don't think it was a major player in the Green Revolution. Potatoes were important, especially in Europe, but again, not the one that kicked off the Third Revolution.

So, putting it all together, the Green Revolution's beginning is closely associated with the development of high-yield corn varieties. That makes me think the answer is D: Corn.

The Third Agricultural Revolution, also known as the Green Revolution, began in the mid-20th century and focused on increasing agricultural productivity through technology and improved crop breeds. Corn, or maize, was a central crop in this revolution, with the development of high-yield varieties playing a key role in boosting food production. Therefore, the correct answer is:
