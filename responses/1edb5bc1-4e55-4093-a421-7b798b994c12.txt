Question:

Let $X$ be uniformly distributed over $\{1, 2, \ldots, 256\}$. We ask random questions: Is $X\in S_1$? Is $X\in S_2$? ... until only one integer remains. All $2^256$ subsets of $\{1, 2, \ldots, 256\}$ are equally likely. How many deterministic questions are needed to determine $X$?

Okay, so I have this problem here where X is uniformly distributed over the set {1, 2, ..., 256}. We're asking random questions like "Is X in S₁?", "Is X in S₂?", and so on until only one integer remains. All possible subsets S₁, S₂, etc., are equally likely, and there are 2^256 of them. The question is asking how many deterministic questions are needed to determine X.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. So, each question is essentially a yes/no question that partitions the set into two subsets: those that are in S_i and those that aren't. Since each S_i is equally likely, each question should ideally split the remaining possibilities as evenly as possible to maximize the information gained each time.

Wait, this reminds me of binary search. In binary search, you can find a target in O(log N) time by repeatedly halving the search space. Here, each question effectively halves the number of possible candidates for X. So, if we start with 256 possibilities, each question should ideally reduce that number by half.

Let me calculate the number of questions needed. Since 2^8 = 256, taking the logarithm base 2 of 256 gives 8. So, you might think you need 8 questions because 2^8 = 256. But wait, the options include F:16, E:8, and so on. So 8 is an option. But wait, let me think again.

Wait, each question is about a subset S_i, but the problem says that all subsets are equally likely. So each question is a random subset, not necessarily the optimal one. But the problem is asking about deterministic questions, so perhaps we're to find the expected number or the maximum number needed.

Wait, no. The question says "deterministic questions". So each question is fixed, not random. But since all subsets are equally likely, each question can't be optimized for a particular X, because the subsets are random. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since each question is a deterministic subset S_i, but the choice of S_i is random. Wait no, the questions are deterministic, but the subsets S_i are chosen uniformly. So perhaps each question is a deterministic subset, but the structure of the subsets is such that they're all possible.

Wait no, perhaps the key is that each question is a deterministic subset, but the way the subsets are chosen is uniform over all possible subsets. So each question is a fixed subset, but since all subsets are equally likely, each question effectively splits the remaining possibilities in half on average.

Wait, but in the worst case, the number of questions needed would be 256, because if each subset S_i is a singleton, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, each question can only split the set into two parts, so each question gives one bit of information.

Wait, each yes/no question gives one bit of information. Since X can take on 256 values, which is 8 bits of information (since 2^8 = 256). So in theory, you'd need 8 questions to uniquely determine X, right? Because each question gives one bit, and 8 bits can uniquely identify each of the 256 possibilities.

But wait, the question is about deterministic questions. So maybe it's exactly 8 questions, so the answer is E:8.

Alternatively, perhaps it's more because each question is a subset, not a bit. Wait, perhaps each question can only split the possibilities into two, but since the subsets are random, the information gain isn't necessarily maximal each time. But wait, the problem states that all subsets are equally likely, so perhaps each question is optimally splitting the possibilities, giving maximum information each time. Therefore, the number of questions would be the minimum needed to distinguish all possibilities, which is log2(256) = 8.

So the answer should be E:8.

The problem involves determining a uniformly distributed integer \( X \) over \(\{1, 2, \ldots, 256\}\) by asking deterministic yes/no questions. Each question is about whether \( X \) belongs to a subset \( S_i \), and all possible subsets are equally likely. To uniquely identify \( X \), each question ideally halves the number of remaining possibilities, as each question provides one bit of information. Since there are 256 possible values for \( X \), which corresponds to \( 2^8 \) possibilities, 8 questions are needed to distinguish all possibilities. Thus, the answer is **E: 8**.
