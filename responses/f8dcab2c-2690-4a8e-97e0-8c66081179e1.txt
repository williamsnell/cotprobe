Okay, so I have this question about specific rotation and density of a camphor solution. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

The question says that a solution of camphor in alcohol in a tube that's 20 cm long rotates the plane of vibration of light by 33 degrees. The specific rotation of camphor is given as +54 degrees. They want the density of camphor in the solution, and the options are from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that specific rotation is a measure of the rotation caused by a pure substance, and it's related to the concentration of the solution. The formula I think is something like observed rotation (α) equals specific rotation (α_sp) multiplied by the concentration (c) and the path length (l). Oh wait, right, the formula is:

α = α_sp * c * l

Wait, or is it α = (α_sp * c) * l? Or maybe it's α = α_sp * (c * l)? I'm a bit confused. Let me think. I think the formula is α = α_sp * (c) * l, where c is the concentration, which is the amount of substance per unit volume, like grams per liter or something. 

Wait, but wait. Specific rotation (α_sp) is the rotation caused by a solution with a concentration of 1 g/mL and a path length of 1 cm, right? So the formula should be α = α_sp * c * l. Because if c is in g/mL and l is in cm, then the product c*l would give g/cm, which isn't directly the unit, but maybe the formula is adjusted.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me clarify. Specific rotation is defined as the rotation when a 1 g/cm³ solution is used, but wait, no, actually, specific rotation is for a solution where the concentration is 1 g per mL, and the path length is 1 dm (10 cm). Because sometimes specific rotation is given for a certain concentration. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact formula again. Oh right, specific rotation (α_sp) is defined as the rotation caused by a solution with a concentration of 1 g/cm³ (density of 1 g/cm³) and a path length of 1 dm (10 cm). So the formula is:

α = α_sp * (c / 1 g/cm³) * (l / 10 cm)

Because the observed rotation is proportional to concentration and path length. So if c is the concentration in g/cm³, then:

α = α_sp * c * (l / 10)

Wait, but in the problem, the solution's density isn't 1 g/cm³. So I need to find the density (d) of the solution, which I think is the same as the concentration, assuming the solution is dilute and the density is approximated as the concentration of camphor. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the solution's density is the mass of the solution per volume, but the concentration (c) is the mass of solute per volume of solution. But for dilute solutions, the density of the solution is approximately equal to the concentration in g/mL when the solvent's density is close to 1. But maybe in this problem, we can assume that the concentration c is equal to the density d of the camphor solution. Hmm, not sure, but perhaps that's the approach.

Wait, maybe I should model it differently. Let me think again. The specific rotation (α_sp) is for a 1 g/cm³ solution, but that's probably in a certain solvent. Wait no, specific rotation is a property of the compound, and it's measured for a solution with a certain concentration. Wait, perhaps the formula is:

Observed rotation α = α_sp * (c / 1 g/10 mL) * (l / 10 cm)

Wait, that's confusing. Let me find a better approach.

The formula is typically:

α = α_sp * (c) * (l / 10)

Where c is the concentration in g per 10 mL, and l is the path length in cm. Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again.

Wait, specific rotation is given as the rotation caused by a solution with a concentration of 1 g per mL (which is 10 g per 10 mL) and a path length of 1 dm (10 cm). So the formula would be:

α = α_sp * (c) * (l / 10)

Where c is the concentration in g/mL, and l is the path length in cm. So for example, if c is in g/mL and l is in cm, then the path length divided by 10 cm (the standard) gives the factor.

Wait, but in the problem, the path length is 20 cm, which is twice the standard 10 cm. So the observed rotation would be α_sp * c * (20/10) = α_sp * c * 2.

Wait, but that can't be right because if the path length is longer, the rotation is higher. So if the specific rotation is 54, and the observed rotation is 33, then 33 = 54 * c * (20/10). So 33 =54 * c * 2 → 33 = 108 c → c = 33/108 ≈ 0.3056 g/mL.

Wait, but wait, the units. Because specific rotation is given for a concentration of 1 g/mL, but in our case, the concentration is c, so the rotation is α = α_sp * c * (l / 10). So in this case, l is 20 cm, so 20/10 = 2, so 33 = 54 * c * 2 → c = 33/(54*2)=33/108=11/36≈0.3056 g/mL.

So the concentration c is approximately 0.3056 g/mL, which is about 0.306 g/cm³. Looking at the options, option C is 0.306 grams per cc, which is the same as 0.306 g/mL. So that must be the answer.

Wait, but wait. I'm assuming that the concentration c is in g/mL, but the solution's density is what's being asked. Wait, the question says "What must the density of camphor be in the solution?" So wait, the solution's density is the mass of the solution per volume, but the concentration c is the mass of camphor per volume of solution. Are these the same? No, not exactly. Because the solution's density would be the total mass (camphor plus alcohol) per volume. So I think I made a mistake here.

Ah, right! I think I confused concentration with density. The density of the solution is the mass of the entire solution per unit volume, while the concentration is the mass of the solute (camphor) per unit volume of solution. So I can't directly equate c to the solution's density. Hmm, so I need to find the solution's density, which is (mass of camphor + mass of alcohol) / total volume.

But wait, without knowing the volume of alcohol used, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the solution's density is approximately equal to the concentration of camphor in g/mL, which would be the case if the solution is dilute. Because if the concentration is low, the density of the solution won't be too different from that of the solvent (alcohol). So maybe in this problem, they're treating the concentration as the density. Let me think.

Wait, but the question is about the density of camphor in the solution. Oh wait, perhaps it's the concentration of camphor in g/mL, which is the same as the density of the solution if the solution is dilute. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is phrased incorrectly, and they meant the concentration, not the density. But regardless, let's proceed.

So, using the formula α = α_sp * c * (l / 10), where c is the concentration in g/mL.

Given α = 33°, α_sp = 54°, l = 20 cm.

So 33 = 54 * c * (20/10) → 33=54*c*2 → 33=108c → c=33/108 ≈ 0.3056 g/mL.

So the concentration of camphor is approximately 0.306 g/mL. If the solution's density is approximately equal to the concentration (which might be the case if the solution is dilute and the solvent's density is close to 1 g/mL), then the density would be about 0.306 g/cm³. So option C is 0.306 grams per cc, which matches.

But wait, the density of the solution is not the same as the concentration. The concentration is mass of solute per volume of solution. The solution's density is (mass of solute + mass of solvent) / total volume. So unless the solution is very dilute, the concentration and density might not be the same. But in the absence of more data, maybe the question expects us to treat the concentration as the density. Because without knowing the density of alcohol and the volumes, we can't compute the exact density of the solution.

Alternatively, perhaps the specific rotation formula uses the concentration in terms of grams per mL, which is the same as the density if the solution's total mass is considered. Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Another approach: Specific rotation is given for a 1 g/mL solution. So if the solution's concentration is c g/mL, the observed rotation would be α = α_sp * c * (l / 10).

So in this case, 33 = 54 * c * (20/10) → 33 = 54 * c * 2 → 33 =108 c → c=33/108=11/36≈0.3056 g/mL.

So the concentration c is 0.3056 g/mL. But the question asks for the density of camphor in the solution, which I think refers to the concentration, not the solution's overall density. Alternatively, if they mean the solution's density, perhaps it's just the same as the concentration because the solution is dilute, so the answer would be option C, 0.306 grams per cc.
</think>

To determine the density of camphor in the solution, we use the relationship between observed rotation, specific rotation, concentration, and path length. The formula is:

\[
\alpha = \alpha_{\text{sp}} \cdot c \cdot \frac{l}{10}
\]

Where:
- \(\alpha\) is the observed rotation (\(33^\circ\)),
- \(\alpha_{\text{sp}}\) is the specific rotation of camphor (\(+54^\circ\)),
- \(c\) is the concentration of camphor in g/mL,
- \(l\) is the path length in cm (\(20 \, \text{cm}\)).

Rearranging the formula to solve for \(c\):

\[
c = \frac{\alpha}{\alpha_{\text{sp}} \cdot \frac{l}{10}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
c = \frac{33}{54 \cdot \frac{20}{10}} = \frac{33}{54 \cdot 2} = \frac{33}{108} \approx 0.3056 \, \text{g/mL}.
\]

Since the question asks for the density of camphor in the solution, and assuming the solution is dilute, the concentration \(c\) (in g/mL) is approximately equal to the density. Therefore, the density of camphor in the solution is approximately \(0.306 \, \text{g/cm}^3\).
