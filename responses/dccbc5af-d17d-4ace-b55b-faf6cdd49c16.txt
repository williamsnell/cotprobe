Question:

At the Harris foundry, the total daily cost of manufacturing m pieces of metal is represented by the following equation: C (in dollars) = 3 m^2 + m + 9. If the cost of the work produced by 9:00 am is $4,849 and the rate of manufacture after 9:00 am is 10 pieces per hr., (i) how many pieces of metal will have been produced by lunch hour (12 noon)? Hint: use the quadratic formula: m = [{- b \pm \surd(b^2 - 4ac)} / {2a}], and other calculations. (ii) When t represents the number of hours past 9:00 am., express the total cost as a function of t.

Options:

A: 90 pieces
B: 50 pieces
C: 60 pieces
D: 100 pieces
E: 95 pieces
F: 70 pieces
G: 85 pieces
H: 65 pieces
I: 75 pieces
J: 80 pieces

Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the question is about calculating the number of metal pieces produced by lunchtime at the Harris foundry. Let's break it down.

First, the problem gives a cost equation: C = 3m² + m + 9, where C is the total daily cost in dollars and m is the number of metal pieces. It also says that at 9:00 am, the cost is $4,849. Hmm, so I guess I need to find out how many pieces have been made by 9 am, but wait, the question is about lunch hour, which is 12 noon. So the time between 9 am and 12 pm is 3 hours. The rate of manufacture after 9 am is 10 pieces per hour, so that should be easy enough to calculate once I know the number of pieces made by 9 am.

Wait, no. Wait a minute. The cost at 9 am is $4,849. That means that at that specific time, the total cost up to that point is $4,849. So I can use the cost equation to find out how many pieces, m, have been made by 9 am. Once I have m, since they're producing at 10 pieces per hour, I can add 3 more hours' worth of production to find the total by lunchtime.

So, step one: solve for m when C is 4,849. The equation is 3m² + m + 9 = 4849. Let me rearrange that: 3m² + m + 9 - 4849 = 0 → 3m² + m - 4840 = 0.

This is a quadratic equation of the form am² + bm + c = 0, where a=3, b=1, c=-4840. To solve for m, I'll use the quadratic formula: m = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a).

Plugging in the numbers: b² is 1² = 1. 4ac is 4 * 3 * (-4840) = 4 * 3 * (-4840). Let me calculate that: 4*3 is 12, and 12 * 4840 is... wait, 12 * 4840. Let me compute that. 4840 * 10 is 48,400, plus 4840*2=9,680, so total is 48,400 + 9,680 = 58,080. But since c is negative, 4ac is -58,080. So the discriminant is b² -4ac = 1 - (-58,080) = 1 + 58,080 = 58,081.

Now, sqrt(58,081). Let me think. 241 squared is 58,081 because 240² is 57,600, and 241² is 57,600 + 2*240 +1 = 57,600 + 480 +1= 58,081. So sqrt(58,081)=241.

So m = [-1 ± 241]/(2*3) → [-1 ±241]/6.

We have two solutions: [240]/6 and [-242]/6. The second solution gives a negative m, which doesn't make sense because m is the number of pieces, so we take the positive one: 240/6=40. So m=40 pieces by 9 am.

Now, from 9 am to 12 pm is 3 hours, and they produce 10 pieces per hour. So 3 *10=30 pieces. So total pieces by lunchtime would be 40 +30=70 pieces. Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused here. Because the cost equation is given as the total daily cost, so does that mean that m is the total for the day, or just up to that point? Hmm, the problem says "the total daily cost of manufacturing m pieces of metal", so I think m is the total produced that day. But wait, the cost at 9 am is $4,849, which would be for the pieces produced up to that time. So maybe I was correct to find m as 40 pieces at 9 am, and then add 30 more to get 70 by lunch.

Wait, but looking at the options, F is 70 pieces, so that's an option. But let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake.

Wait, let me check the quadratic solution again. The equation was 3m² +m -4840=0. Using the quadratic formula, m = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 4*3*4840)]/(2*3). Wait, wait, 4ac would be 4*3*(-4840) = 12*(-4840) = -58,080. So the discriminant is b² -4ac = 1 - (-58,080) = 58,081. sqrt(58,081)=241, correct. So m = (-1 +241)/6 = 240/6=40, correct.

Then, adding 3 hours at 10 per hour: 40+30=70. So the answer is F:70 pieces.

Wait, but the second part of the question asks to express the total cost as a function of t, where t is the number of hours past 9 am. So part (ii) is about expressing C as a function of t. But the question only asks for part (i), so the answer is 70, which is option F.

The problem involves calculating the number of metal pieces produced by lunchtime. Using the given cost equation, we first determine the number of pieces produced by 9:00 am. Solving the quadratic equation yields 40 pieces. Adding 3 hours of production at 10 pieces per hour gives a total of 70 pieces by lunchtime.

Answer: F
