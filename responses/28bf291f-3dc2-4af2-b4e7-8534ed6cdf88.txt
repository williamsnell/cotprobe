Okay, so I've got this history question here about the French Revolution, specifically focusing on Robespierre's radical phase and which of his changes was least beneficial to defending France. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to remember who Robespierre was. He was a key figure during the radical phase of the revolution, known for his leadership during the Reign of Terror. His main goal was to purge France of enemies of the revolution and establish a more just society based on republican principles.

The question is asking which of the options listed was the least beneficial to France's defense. So I need to evaluate each option in terms of how much they actually helped defend France during that time.

Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Encouraging the spread of revolutionary ideas abroad. I think this was part of the idea of exporting the revolution, which could inspire other countries to support France or start their own revolutions. It might have had mixed effects. On one hand, it could create allies, but on the other, it might have made other European powers more hostile, leading to invasions. But I'm not sure if it's the least beneficial.

Option B: Implementing the Reign of Terror. This was Robespierre's most notorious action. The Reign of Terror involved mass executions, primarily of those seen as counter-revolutionaries. While it was meant to eliminate internal threats and enemies, it probably caused a lot of fear and instability. However, it did help in consolidating power quickly, which could have been beneficial for defense by removing threats. But it's also known for being excessive and leading to political problems, so maybe it wasn't the best for long-term defense.

Option C: Expelling foreign diplomats. This makes sense because foreign diplomats might have been spies or trying to influence France against the revolution. By expelling them, France could prevent external interference and make sure that internal decisions weren't swayed by foreign powers. This seems like a defensive move, so probably beneficial.

Option D: Pursuing a policy of de-Christianization. During the revolution, the church was seen as a counter-revolutionary force, especially the Catholic Church. De-Christianization involved things like the Civil Constitution of the clergy, where priests were made to swear allegiance to the state. It could have caused a lot of social unrest, but it also aimed to secularize the state, which might have been seen as a defense against foreign influences (since the Pope was a foreign power). However, this might have alienated a lot of people and caused internal conflict, which could have weakened the state defensively.

Option E: Fixing prices and wages. This was part of economic policies to control inflation and the economy. By fixing prices, the government tried to prevent economic collapse and keep the population stable. This would have been beneficial for defense because a stable economy supports the war effort. If people are hungry and prices are too high, they might riot or be less supportive, so controlling this was probably good for defense.

Option F: Abolishing slavery in French colonies. This was a significant move. Slavery was abolished in 1794, which was during Robespierre's time. It would have likely gained support from abolitionists and could have been seen as a progressive move. However, economically, this might have hurt the colonies, making them less productive. But in terms of national defense, it's not clear how much it directly contributed. It was more of a moral stance than a defense measure, so maybe it wasn't the most beneficial for defense.

Option G: Promoting soldiers based upon their merits in the field. This makes sense because merit-based promotion would create a more efficient and motivated military. If soldiers know they can advance based on their performance, they're more likely to fight harder. This was beneficial for the military and thus for defense.

Option H: Enforcing strict rationing of food supplies. Rationing was crucial because without enough food, the population could become restless, leading to uprisings or lack of support for the government. By rationing, the government could ensure that the military and the population had enough to function, which is good for defense.

Option I: Instituting a new Republican Calendar. This was a symbolic change, renaming the months and days to reflect republican ideals. While it might have been inspiring to the faithful revolutionaries, I don't think it had a direct impact on defense. It was more about cultural change than practical matters, so it might have been less beneficial.

Option J: The conscription of huge armies. Conscription, or the levée en masse, was a key factor in the French military success. By drafting large numbers of people, France could field much larger armies than its enemies, which was crucial for defending the country against foreign invasions. This was definitely beneficial for defense.

Now, I need to figure out which of these was least beneficial. Let's evaluate each.

A: Spreading ideas could have both pros and cons. It might have inspired allies but also caused foreign opposition. Not sure yet.

B: The Reign of Terror was effective in removing internal enemies but caused a lot of fear and instability. It could have led to overextension of the government and made it harder to govern effectively, which might have weakened defense in the long run.

C: Expelling diplomats was a good move for defense, as it prevented foreign influence.

D: De-Christianization caused social unrest, which might have weakened the state internally, making it harder to defend externally.

E: Fixing prices was good for stability, so beneficial.

F: Abolishing slavery might have hurt the economy but was more of a symbolic move. It didn't directly contribute to defense.

G: Merit-based promotion was good for the military.

H: Rationing was good for stability and military support.

I: Republican calendar was symbolic, not practical.

J: Conscription was very beneficial for defense.

So, the options seem to be between A, B, D, F, and I as the least beneficial.

The question is which was the least beneficial. Let's think about each.

Option F: Abolishing slavery. It was a progressive move but may have weakened the economy, especially in colonies, which might have reduced France's overall strength. However, it's not clear if this directly impacted defense. Maybe it was more symbolic and less about practical defense.

Option I: The Republican Calendar. This was a symbolic gesture, probably had little to do with defense. It didn't directly make France stronger or help in fighting the wars.

Option B: The Reign of Terror. While it did eliminate internal threats, it led to the deaths of many innocent people, creating a lot of fear. This could have made the government less effective and more isolated, which might have been bad for defense. But it's a tough call because it did help in consolidating power quickly.

Option D: De-Christianization. This caused a lot of social conflict and alienation, which could have weakened internal cohesion and support for the revolution, thus making defense harder.

Option F: Abolishing slavery. It was a good move but perhaps not as impactful on defense as other policies. It's possible that the economic impact was negative, but during the time, the colonies might not have been as crucial as other factors.

Now, looking for the least beneficial. The question is which change was least beneficial to defense. So, the one that either didn't help at all or even hindered defense.

The Republican Calendar (I) seems the least relevant to defense. It was more about cultural and symbolic changes, not about practical measures like military strength, economy, or internal security.

Alternatively, the Reign of Terror (B) was very harsh but also kept internal enemies in check. It's a tough call, but I think the Republican Calendar was the least beneficial because it didn't contribute to defense mechanisms.
