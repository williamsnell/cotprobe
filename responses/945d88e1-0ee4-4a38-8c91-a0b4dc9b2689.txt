Okay, so I've got this economics question about monopsony and perfectly competitive labor markets. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, what do I remember about monopsony? Monopsony is a market structure where there's only one buyer of a particular good or service, in this case, labor. So, the employer is the sole purchaser of labor, which gives them some market power. Because of this, they can dictate terms to workers, right? In a monopsony, the employer doesn't face competition, so they might pay lower wages and maybe control employment levels.

Now, in a perfectly competitive labor market, there are many buyers (employers) and many sellers (workers). Each employer is a price taker, meaning they have to accept the market wage. There's no single entity dictating the wage; it's determined by supply and demand. So, in perfect competition, wages tend to be higher because employers can't lower them below the equilibrium without losing workers to other employers.

The question is asking what happens if a monopsony suddenly becomes perfectly competitive. So, the change would be from a single employer setting the wage and determining employment to a competitive market where multiple employers set the wage.

In a monopsony, the employer faces a supply curve of labor. They can choose how much to hire and set the wage. Because they're the only buyer, they can set the wage lower than the competitive equilibrium. They also might hire fewer workers because the marginal cost of labor increases as they hire more. So, in monopsony, the wage is lower, and employment is lower than in a competitive market.

When it becomes competitive, the wage should rise because now there are multiple employers. Each employer can only offer the competitive wage, and if they try to pay less, workers will go elsewhere. So, the wage goes up. What about employment? In a competitive market, with a higher wage, more workers will want to work, so employment increases.

Wait, but let me think again. In monopsony, the firm's marginal cost of labor (MCL) curve is upward sloping because to hire more workers, they have to pay a higher wage. The firm will hire up to the point where MCL equals their marginal revenue product (MRP). In competitive markets, the wage is determined by the intersection of supply and demand, so the MCL is flat because the wage is fixed. So, in competitive markets, the firm will hire more workers because they can without increasing the wage beyond the market rate.

So, when moving from monopsony to competition, the wage increases, and employment increases as well. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes when wages rise, demand might fall, but in the case of labor, higher wages could mean more workers are willing to work, so the quantity of labor supplied increases. But in the case of monopsony, the firm was paying a lower wage and hiring fewer workers. When it becomes competitive, the firm can't pay less, so they have to pay the market wage, which is higher, and they'll hire more workers because the wage doesn't force them to reduce employment anymore.

Wait, but in a monopsony, the firm's MCL is the same as the supply curve. They pay a lower wage, and the quantity supplied is lower. In competition, the wage is higher, and the quantity supplied is higher. So both wage and employment go up.

Wait, but I'm mixing up the firm's perspective with the market. Let me clarify. In monopsony, the firm is the only buyer, so they set the wage. The market supply curve is such that at a lower wage, fewer workers are employed. But when competition arrives, the wage is set by the intersection of supply and demand, which is higher than the monopsony wage, and the employment level is higher.

So, the conclusion is that when a monopsony becomes perfectly competitive, the wage increases, and employment also increases.

Looking back at the options, option B says both would increase. Option H says employment increases, wage decreases, which is the opposite. Option I says wage falls and employment increases, which doesn't make sense because the wage should rise. So the correct answer should be B: Both would increase.

When a monopsony labor market transitions to a perfectly competitive one, the wage increases because employers can no longer dictate lower wages and must pay the market-determined rate. Employment also rises as the competitive wage attracts more workers, and firms expand hiring due to the flat marginal cost of labor. Thus, both wage and employment increase.

Answer: B
