Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again: A train is moving at 60 miles per hour and it's rounding a curve with a radius of curvature of 484 feet. I need to find its acceleration. The options are from A to J, and I have to choose the correct one. 

Hmm, I remember that when an object moves in a circular path, it experiences centripetal acceleration. The formula for centripetal acceleration is a = v² / r, right? But wait, I need to make sure all the units match because the speed is given in miles per hour and the radius is in feet. Oh, right, I'll have to convert the units so they're consistent.

First, let me note down the given values. The speed v is 60 mi/hr, and the radius r is 484 ft. The acceleration a is what I'm looking for.

I think the first step is to convert the speed from miles per hour to feet per second because the radius is in feet and acceleration is commonly in ft/s². I remember that 1 mile is 5280 feet and 1 hour is 3600 seconds. So, to convert mi/hr to ft/s, I can multiply by (5280 ft/mile) and divide by (3600 s/hr). Let me calculate that.

So, v = 60 mi/hr. Converting to ft/s:
v = 60 * (5280 ft/mile) / (3600 s/hr)
Let me do the math. 60 divided by 3600 is 0.016666... And 5280 times 60 is 316,800 ft/mi per hour. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 60 miles per hour is 60 * 5280 feet per hour. So 60 * 5280 = 316,800 ft/hr. Then, to get per second, divide by 3600: 316800 / 3600 = 88 ft/s. Oh, right! Because I've heard that 60 mph is 88 ft/s. So v is 88 ft/s.

Now, using the centripetal acceleration formula, a = v² / r. Plugging in the values:

a = (88 ft/s)² / 484 ft.

Calculating the numerator: 88 squared. 80 squared is 6400, and 8 squared is 64, but wait, 88^2 is (80+8)^2 = 80² + 2*80*8 +8² = 6400 + 1280 +64 = 7744. So 7744 divided by 484.

Now, let me compute 7744 ÷ 484. Hmm, maybe I can simplify this division. Let's see if 484 goes into 7744 evenly. Let's divide 484 by 4 first: 484 ÷4 is 121. Then 7744 ÷ 4 is 1936. So now it's 1936 ÷ 121. Because 484 times 4 is 1936. So 484 times 16? Wait, maybe I should check another way. Alternatively, 121 times 16 is 1936 because 120*16=1920, and 1*16=16, so 1936. So 7744 ÷484 = 16.

Wait, so a = 16 ft/s². So looking at the options, H is 16 ft/s². So the answer should be H.

Wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check the calculations. 

Converting 60 mi/hr to ft/s: 60 *5280 = 316800 ft/hr. Divided by 3600, that's 88 ft/s. Correct.

Then a = (88)^2 /484 = 7744 /484. Let me compute 484 * 16: 484 *10=4840, 484*6=2904, so total is 4840+2904=7744. Yep, so 7744 ÷484 =16. So acceleration is 16 ft/s². So option H is correct.
</think>

The train's speed is converted from 60 mi/hr to 88 ft/s. Using the centripetal acceleration formula \( a = \frac{v^2}{r} \), we calculate \( a = \frac{88^2}{484} = 16 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \).

Answer: H
