Okay, so I've got this question about Anorexia Nervosa and which of the listed options isn't a diagnostic feature. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that Anorexia Nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by significant weight loss, a fear of gaining weight, and a distorted body image. The key features I know include things like restricting food intake, sometimes excessive exercise, and an intense fear of becoming fat, even when underweight.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Sleep disorders. I'm not sure if sleep disorders are a direct diagnostic feature. I know that anorexia can cause various physical issues, like irregular periods or fatigue, but does it specifically cause sleep disorders? Maybe it's more of a secondary effect rather than a primary diagnostic symptom.

Option B: Rapid heartbeat. That sounds familiar. I think when someone is underweight, their heart might beat faster because the body is trying to compensate for lower blood pressure or something. So rapid heartbeat could be a physical sign linked to anorexia.

Option C: High blood pressure. Wait, I'm a bit confused here. I thought that with anorexia, blood pressure might actually be low, not high. Because when you're underweight, your blood pressure tends to drop. So high blood pressure might not be a feature. But I'm not entirely sure; maybe it varies from person to person.

Option D: Obsession with physical activity. Yes, that's a big one. People with anorexia often obsess about exercise, using it as a way to burn calories and control their weight. So this is definitely a diagnostic feature.

Option E: Significant weight loss. Definitely a key symptom. Without significant weight loss, it wouldn't be anorexia nervosa.

Option F: Depressive symptoms. I know that many people with anorexia also experience depression, but is that a diagnostic feature? Or is it more of a comorbid condition? The DSM criteria focus more on behaviors and attitudes, not necessarily mood disorders, though they can occur together.

Option G: Fear of becoming fat. That's a core feature. The individual has a relentless fear of gaining weight, even when they're clearly underweight.

Option H: Body Image Distortion. Yes, this is part of the diagnostic criteria. They might see themselves as fat even when others see them as thin.

So, putting it together, the question is asking which is NOT a diagnostic feature. The options I'm considering are A (Sleep disorders) and C (High blood pressure). 

From what I remember, the DSM-5 lists specific criteria, which include restriction of energy intake leading to significantly low body weight, intense fear of gaining weight, disturbance in self-perceived weight or shape, and behaviors like excessive exercise. So things like rapid heartbeat (B) and high blood pressure (C) might be physical symptoms that occur due to the disorder but aren't part of the diagnostic criteria themselves.

Wait, but I thought low blood pressure is more common in anorexia. So high blood pressure (C) is probably not a feature. Alternatively, rapid heartbeat (B) could be due to low blood pressure or other factors, but I'm not sure if it's a direct diagnostic symptom.

Also, sleep disorders (A) might be a result of the condition but not a primary diagnostic feature.

So, the options that are definitely diagnostic features are D, E, G, H. F might be a comorbid issue but not a diagnostic feature. So the ones that are not diagnostic would be A, B, C.

But the question is asking which is NOT considered a diagnostic feature. So the options that are not features are A, B, C, and F perhaps.

Wait, but looking back, the options are A to H, and the answer is one of them.

Wait, the options are A: Sleep disorders, B: Rapid heartbeat, C: High blood pressure, D: Obsession with physical activity, E: Significant weight loss, F: Depressive symptoms, G: Fear of becoming fat, H: Body Image Distortion.

So which of these is not a diagnostic feature.

D is a feature because of excessive exercise. E is definitely a feature. G and H are core features. F is not a diagnostic feature but a common comorbidity.

So the non-diagnostic features would be A, B, C, and F.

The question is which one is not a diagnostic feature, so the answer would be one of these.

But the options are given, and I need to pick the one that's not a feature.

Wait, the question is asking which is NOT considered a diagnostic feature.

So the correct answer would be either A, B, C, or F.

I think the most likely answer is C: High blood pressure. Because in anorexia, blood pressure tends to be low, not high. So high blood pressure isn't a feature.

Alternatively, sleep disorders (A) might not be a diagnostic feature, but I'm not certain. Similarly, rapid heartbeat (B) could be due to low blood pressure or other factors, but I'm not sure if it's listed as a diagnostic feature.

Wait, the DSM criteria don't list physical symptoms like rapid heartbeat or high blood pressure as diagnostic features. They focus on behavioral and psychological aspects.

So the options that are not diagnostic features include A, B, C, F.

Looking at the options, the question is which of the following is not a diagnostic feature. So the correct answer is either A, B, C, or F.

But among the options, the most obvious non-feature would be C: High blood pressure, because it's more associated with being overweight or other conditions, not anorexia.

Alternatively, sleep disorders (A) could be a result but not a cause.

I think the correct answer is C: High blood pressure.

The question asks which of the listed options is not considered a diagnostic feature of Anorexia Nervosa. Analyzing each option:

- **A: Sleep disorders** may occur as a secondary effect but are not a primary diagnostic feature.
- **B: Rapid heartbeat** can be a physical symptom due to low blood pressure but is not a direct diagnostic feature.
- **C: High blood pressure** is unlikely to be a feature, as anorexia typically causes low blood pressure.
- **D: Obsession with physical activity** is a core feature.
- **E: Significant weight loss** is a key diagnostic criterion.
- **F: Depressive symptoms** are common but not a diagnostic feature.
- **G: Fear of becoming fat** is a core feature.
- **H: Body Image Distortion** is also a core feature.

The most likely answer is **C: High blood pressure**, as it is not a diagnostic feature of Anorexia Nervosa.

**Answer: C**
