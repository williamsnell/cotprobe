Okay, so I'm trying to figure out Miss Lane's adjusted gross income and gross income for 1978 based on the information provided. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the definitions. From what I remember, the taxable income is the amount after all deductions and exemptions have been applied. So, taxable income is usually less than the gross income because various deductions reduce it.

Looking at the data given:
- Taxable income: $15,000
- Exemptions: $1,500
- Business Expenses: $6,000
- Non-business Expenses: $3,000

I think I need to calculate the gross income first. Gross income is the total income before any deductions. So, I remember that the formula for taxable income is:

Taxable Income = Gross Income - Adjustments (like business and non-business expenses) - Exemptions

Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think again. The formula for adjusted gross income (AGI) is usually:

AGI = Gross Income - Adjustments (which include business and non-business expenses)

But I'm a bit confused because sometimes people use different terms. I think the correct formula is that AGI is calculated by subtracting certain deductions from the gross income. In this case, the business and non-business expenses are deductions that reduce the gross income to arrive at AGI, right?

Wait, but the question says "adjusted gross income" and "gross income." So, I think the Gross Income is the total income before any deductions, and AGI is the Gross Income minus the business and non-business expenses. Then, from AGI, you subtract exemptions and other deductions to get the taxable income.

Wait, no. Maybe the formula is:

Taxable Income = AGI - Exemptions

And AGI is calculated as:

AGI = Gross Income - Business Expenses - Non-business Expenses

So, if that's the case, then:

Taxable Income = AGI - Exemptions

We know Taxable Income is $15,000 and Exemptions are $1,500. So,

$15,000 = AGI - $1,500

So, AGI would be $15,000 + $1,500 = $16,500

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the options don't have AGI as $16,500 except in option E, where AGI is $16,500 and Gross Income is $28,500. But let me check.

Alternatively, maybe I have the order wrong. Let me think again: perhaps the AGI is the amount after subtracting business and non-business expenses from the gross income, and then the taxable income is AGI minus exemptions.

So, AGI = Gross Income - Business Expenses - Non-business Expenses

Then, Taxable Income = AGI - Exemptions

So, rearranging that, we can solve for Gross Income.

Let me write the equations:

Equation 1: AGI = Gross Income - Business Expenses - Non-business Expenses

Equation 2: Taxable Income = AGI - Exemptions

We know Taxable Income = $15,000, Business Expenses = $6,000, Non-business Expenses = $3,000, Exemptions = $1,500.

From Equation 2: $15,000 = AGI - $1,500 → AGI = $15,000 + $1,500 = $16,500

Now, substitute AGI into Equation 1:

$16,500 = Gross Income - $6,000 - $3,000 → Gross Income = $16,500 + $9,000 = $25,500

So, Gross Income is $25,500 and AGI is $16,500.

Looking at the options, option E is AGI $16,500 and Gross Income $28,500. Wait, that doesn't match because here I got Gross Income as $25,500, which isn't in option E. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check again. Oh, wait, in the options, option E is AGI $16,500 and Gross Income $28,500. But according to my calculation, I have Gross Income as $25,500. So that doesn't match any option. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe I have the order reversed. Let me think again. Maybe the AGI includes only business expenses, and non-business expenses are subtracted after AGI. Or perhaps I'm mixing up the terms.

Wait, I think I might have mixed up the order. Let me check the definitions again. In the US tax system, Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) is calculated by taking your gross income and subtracting certain adjustments, which include business expenses, non-business expenses, and other deductions. Then, from AGI, you subtract exemptions and other deductions to get taxable income.

Wait, but in this case, the problem says that the "taxable income" is $15,000, and the "exemptions" are $1,500. So, taxable income is AGI minus exemptions.

So, Taxable Income = AGI - Exemptions → AGI = Taxable Income + Exemptions = $15,000 + $1,500 = $16,500.

Then, AGI is calculated as Gross Income minus business and non-business expenses.

So, AGI = Gross Income - (Business Expenses + Non-business Expenses) → $16,500 = Gross Income - ($6,000 + $3,000) → Gross Income = $16,500 + $9,000 = $25,500.

So, Gross Income is $25,500, AGI is $16,500.

Looking at the options, option E says AGI $16,500 and Gross Income $28,500. That's not matching. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding what's given. The problem states:

"Taxable income $15,000 Exemptions 1,500 Business Expenses 6,000 Non business Expenses 3,000"

So, maybe the taxable income is after all deductions, including exemptions. So, perhaps the formula is:

Taxable Income = Gross Income - (Business Expenses + Non-business Expenses + Exemptions)

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because exemptions are typically subtracted after AGI. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the taxable income is the AGI minus exemptions, so:

AGI = Taxable Income + Exemptions = $15,000 + $1,500 = $16,500.

Then, AGI is calculated as:

AGI = Gross Income - (Business Expenses + Non-business Expenses) → $16,500 = Gross Income - $9,000 → Gross Income = $25,500.

So, that would mean the answer is AGI $16,500 and Gross Income $25,500. But looking at the options, option E says AGI $16,500 and Gross Income $28,500. Option A says AGI $19,500 and Gross Income $25,500. Wait, so none of the options match exactly. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me double-check.

AGI = Gross Income - (Business Expenses + Non-business Expenses) → $16,500 = GI - $9,000 → GI = $16,500 + $9,000 = $25,500.

So, GI $25,500, AGI $16,500.

Looking at the options, the only option where AGI is $16,500 is option E, but it says GI is $28,500, which is higher than what I calculated. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the "exemptions" are already included in the taxable income. Let me think differently. Maybe the taxable income is after all deductions, including exemptions. So, maybe the formula is:

Taxable Income = Gross Income - (Business Expenses + Non-business Expenses + Exemptions)

So, $15,000 = GI - ($6,000 + $3,000 + $1,500) → GI = $15,000 + $10,500 = $25,500.

But then, AGI would be GI minus business and non-business expenses, which is $25,500 - $9,000 = $16,500, same as before.

So, same result: GI $25,500, AGI $16,500.

Looking at the options, the only one that has AGI $16,500 is option E, but its GI is $28,500, which is higher. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe the business and non-business expenses are not part of the AGI calculation. Maybe I'm confusing the terms. Let me think again.

In the US tax system, AGI is calculated by starting with gross income and subtracting certain items, such as business expenses, non-business expenses, and others. Then, from AGI, you subtract exemptions and other deductions to get taxable income.

So, the correct formula is:

AGI = Gross Income - (Business Expenses + Non-business Expenses)

Taxable Income = AGI - Exemptions

So, given that, we have:

Taxable Income = AGI - Exemptions → $15,000 = AGI - $1,500 → AGI = $15,000 + $1,500 = $16,500.

Then, AGI = GI - ($6,000 + $3,000) → $16,500 = GI - $9,000 → GI = $25,500.

So, the correct AGI is $16,500 and GI is $25,500. Looking at the options, only option E has AGI $16,500, but it says GI is $28,500. That doesn't match. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the business and non-business expenses are not both subtracted. Maybe only certain types are allowed. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the business expenses are only for the business part, and non-business are other deductions. But I think in the context of the problem, they're both deductions that reduce AGI.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the business and non-business expenses are part of the AGI calculation, but the "taxable income" is after subtracting the exemptions from AGI.

So, if AGI is $16,500, and GI is $25,500, then the only option that has AGI $16,500 is E, but GI is $28,500.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the Gross Income. Let me think again.

If AGI is $16,500, and AGI = GI - (6,000 + 3,000) → GI = 16,500 + 9,000 = 25,500.

Yes, that's correct. So, GI is $25,500, AGI is $16,500.

Looking at the options, none of them have GI as $25,500 except option A, which says AGI $19,500 and GI $25,500. But that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Maybe the formula is:

AGI = Gross Income - (Business Expenses + Non-business Expenses) + Exemptions

No, that doesn't make sense because exemptions are subtracted after AGI.

I think I'm stuck here. The correct calculation leads me to GI $25,500 and AGI $16,500, but the options don't have that combination except option E, which has a higher GI. So, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the "exemptions" are part of the AGI calculation. Let me think again. Maybe AGI is calculated as:

AGI = Gross Income - Business Expenses - Non-business Expenses

Then, Taxable Income = AGI - Exemptions

So, $15,000 = (GI - 6,000 - 3,000) - 1,500 → $15,000 = GI - 9,000 - 1,500 → GI = $15,000 + 9,000 + 1,500 = $25,500.

Yes, same result. So, AGI would be $25,500 - 9,000 = $16,500, then taxable income is $16,500 - 1,500 = $15,000. That matches.

So, the correct AGI is $16,500, GI is $25,500.

Looking at the options, option E says AGI $16,500 and GI $28,500. That's not matching. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the "exemptions" are added back in. No, that doesn't make sense. Exemptions reduce taxable income.

Wait, maybe the problem is using a different terminology. Perhaps "adjusted gross income" is calculated differently. Alternatively, maybe the business expenses are not part of the calculation. But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the business expenses are considered as part of AGI, but the non-business expenses are not. Or vice versa.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. Let me list the options:

A: AGI $19,500, GI $25,500

B: AGI $8,500, GI $23,500

C: AGI $20,000, GI $25,000

D: AGI $9,000, GI $21,000

E: AGI $16,500, GI $28,500

F: AGI $12,000, GI $27,000

G: AGI $11,500, GI $22,500

H: AGI $10,500, GI $20,500

I: AGI $19,000, GI $26,000

J: AGI $18,500, GI $24,500

So, none of the options except E have AGI $16,500, but GI is $28,500, which is higher than my calculation of $25,500.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the "taxable income" is the AGI, and the problem is asking for AGI and GI.

Wait, that can't be, because the problem says "adjusted gross income" and "gross income."

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the "taxable income" is the AGI after subtracting exemptions, so:

AGI = Taxable Income + Exemptions = $15,000 + $1,500 = $16,500.

Then, AGI is calculated as GI minus business and non-business expenses. So, $16,500 = GI - 6,000 - 3,000 → GI = $25,500.

So, same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the business and non-business expenses are not both subtracted from GI. Maybe only one of them is considered. But that doesn't make sense because both are deductions.

Alternatively, perhaps the business expenses are $6,000, and non-business are $3,000, so total deductions are $9,000, leading to GI of $25,500.

So, the correct answer should be GI $25,500 and AGI $16,500, which isn't present exactly in the options. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the problem is that the "exemptions" are part of the AGI calculation. So, perhaps AGI = Gross Income - (Business Expenses + Non-business Expenses + Exemptions).

Then, taxable income would be AGI minus something else, but that doesn't make sense because exemptions are usually subtracted after AGI.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the taxable income is calculated as:

Taxable Income = Gross Income - Business Expenses - Non-business Expenses - Exemptions.

So, $15,000 = GI - 6,000 - 3,000 - 1,500 → GI = 15,000 + 6,000 +3,000 +1,500 = $25,500.

Then, AGI would be GI minus business and non-business expenses, which is $25,500 - 9,000 = $16,500.

So, same result again.

But looking at the options, the only option with AGI $16,500 is E, but GI is $28,500, which is higher. So, perhaps the options are incorrect, or I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the business expenses are only $6,000, and non-business are $3,000, so total deductions are $9,000. So, GI = Taxable Income + Deductions + Exemptions?

Wait, no, because that would be:

GI = Taxable Income + (Business Expenses + Non-business Expenses) + Exemptions.

Which would be $15,000 + $9,000 + $1,500 = $25,500.

That's the same as before.

I'm stuck. According to my calculations, the correct answer is AGI $16,500 and GI $25,500, but the options don't have that. The only option with AGI $16,500 is E, with GI $28,500. That's a $3,000 difference. Maybe I made a mistake in adding.

Wait, let me recalculate:

If AGI is $16,500, and that's calculated as GI minus $9,000, then GI = $16,500 + $9,000 = $25,500.

Yes, that's correct.

So, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but since it's a multiple-choice question, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the question.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the "exemptions" are included in the AGI, so:

AGI = Taxable Income + Exemptions = $15,000 + $1,500 = $16,500.

Then, AGI is calculated as GI minus (Business + Non-business) = $16,500 = GI - $9,000 → GI = $25,500.

So, same result.

Looking at the options, none match exactly, but perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the business expenses are not part of the AGI calculation. That would be unusual.

Wait, perhaps the business expenses are not subtracted from GI to get AGI. Maybe only non-business expenses are. Then, AGI would be GI minus non-business expenses, and then from AGI, subtract business expenses and exemptions to get taxable income.

But that doesn't make sense because business and non-business expenses are both considered in AGI.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the business expenses are subtracted from GI to get AGI, and non-business expenses are subtracted after AGI.

Wait, that would mean:

AGI = GI - Business Expenses

Then, Taxable Income = AGI - Non-business Expenses - Exemptions.

So, $15,000 = (GI - 6,000) - 3,000 - 1,500 → $15,000 = GI - 6,000 -4,500 → GI = $15,000 + 10,500 = $25,500.

Then, AGI would be $25,500 - 6,000 = $19,500.

So, AGI is $19,500, GI is $25,500.

Looking at the options, option A says AGI $19,500 and GI $25,500. That matches.

But wait, is that correct? Because typically, both business and non-business expenses are subtracted to calculate AGI.

Hmm, perhaps that's the confusion here. Maybe the problem is considering only business expenses as part of AGI, and non-business expenses are considered elsewhere.

But I'm not sure. Given that, if I take option A, AGI $19,500 and GI $25,500, that would be the case if only business expenses are subtracted to get AGI, and then non-business expenses and exemptions are subtracted from AGI to get taxable income.

But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should stick to the initial approach where both are subtracted from GI to get AGI.

Given that, the correct answer would be AGI $16,500 and GI $25,500, but since that's not an option, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the "exemptions" are subtracted from the taxable income, which is calculated as AGI minus exemptions. So, taxable income is AGI minus exemptions.

So, AGI = taxable income + exemptions = $15,000 + $1,500 = $16,500.

Then, AGI = GI - (business + non-business) → $16,500 = GI - 9,000 → GI = $25,500.

Again, same result.

But the options don't have that. So, perhaps the correct answer is option E, but I'm not sure why GI is $28,500.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something else. Let me think about the components again.

Wait, perhaps the business expenses are $6,000 and non-business are $3,000, which total $9,000. So, GI is $25,500, AGI is $16,500.

But option E has GI $28,500 and AGI $16,500.

Wait, $28,500 minus $9,000 is $19,500, which would make AGI $19,500, which is option A.

Hmm, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the "taxable income" is calculated as:

Taxable Income = Gross Income - Business Expenses - Non-business Expenses - Exemptions.

So, $15,000 = GI - 6,000 -3,000 -1,500 → GI = 15,000 + 10,500 = $25,500.

Then, AGI would be GI minus business and non-business expenses, which is $25,500 - 9,000 = $16,500.

Same result again.

So, perhaps the correct answer is not present, but the closest would be option E, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the business expenses are not part of the AGI calculation. Maybe business expenses are considered elsewhere, like in business taxes, so they don't affect AGI. But that doesn't make sense because business expenses are part of the calculation for AGI.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different definition where AGI is the same as taxable income plus exemptions, but that seems odd.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the "adjusted gross income" is the same as taxable income, but that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the "adjusted gross income" is the taxable income plus the exemptions, so AGI = $15,000 + $1,500 = $16,500.

Then, the gross income is AGI plus business and non-business expenses, so $16,500 + $9,000 = $25,500.

So, same result.

But again, the options don't have that combination.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. Option E is AGI $16,500 and GI $28,500. That's a $3,000 difference. Maybe I'm missing $3,000 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the "exemptions" are part of the business expenses, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the non-business expenses are not subtracted from AGI, but from taxable income. So, let's try that.

So, AGI = GI - Business Expenses = GI - 6,000.

Then, Taxable Income = AGI - Non-business Expenses - Exemptions.

So, $15,000 = (GI - 6,000) - 3,000 - 1,500 → $15,000 = GI - 10,500 → GI = $25,500.

Then, AGI = $25,500 - 6,000 = $19,500.

So, AGI is $19,500 and GI is $25,500. That matches option A.

So, perhaps that's the correct approach. Maybe non-business expenses are not part of AGI.

But I'm not sure because typically, both business and non-business expenses are subtracted to calculate AGI.

However, given the options, option A fits if non-business expenses are subtracted after AGI.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option A: AGI $19,500 and GI $25,500.

To determine Miss Lane's adjusted gross income (AGI) and gross income (GI) for 1978, we analyze the provided data:

- **Taxable Income**: $15,000  
- **Exemptions**: $1,500  
- **Business Expenses**: $6,000  
- **Non-Business Expenses**: $3,000  

### Key Formulas:
1. **Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)** is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{AGI} = \text{Gross Income} - (\text{Business Expenses} + \text{Non-Business Expenses})
   \]
2. **Taxable Income** is derived from AGI after subtracting exemptions:
   \[
   \text{Taxable Income} = \text{AGI} - \text{Exemptions}
   \]

### Calculations:
1. Rearranging the taxable income formula to find AGI:
   \[
   \text{AGI} = \text{Taxable Income} + \text{Exemptions} = \$15,000 + \$1,500 = \$16,500
   \]
2. Substituting AGI into the first formula to find GI:
   \[
   \$16,500 = \text{GI} - (\$6,000 + \$3,000) \implies \text{GI} = \$16,500 + \$9,000 = \$25,500
   \]

### Matching with Options:
- The calculated AGI is \$16,500, and GI is \$25,500. However, none of the options exactly match this combination.  
- Option **A** states AGI = \$19,500 and GI = \$25,500. This matches the GI but not the AGI.  
- Option **E** states AGI = \$16,500 and GI = \$28,500. This matches the AGI but not the GI.

Given the discrepancy, the closest match is **Option A**, assuming non-business expenses are not subtracted from AGI but from taxable income instead. 

ANSWER: A
