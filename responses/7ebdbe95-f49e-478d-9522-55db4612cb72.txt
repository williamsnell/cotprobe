Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about J. S. Bacq & Co.'s penny arcade, and they want to make a $1,000 profit each week. I need to find out how many customers they need to visit to achieve that.

First, I'll list out the given information. The fixed costs are wages and electricity at $500 per week, and upkeep and miscellaneous costs at $100 per week. So total fixed costs would be 500 + 100 = $600 per week.

Then, there's a cost for the surprise gift given to each customer, which is $2.00 per customer. So each customer that comes in costs the arcade $2 in gifts. That would be a variable cost because it depends on the number of customers.

The sole charge per customer is $6.00 for admission. So the revenue per customer is $6, but the cost per customer is $2, so the profit per customer would be 6 - 2 = $4.

Wait, no, actually, I think I need to clarify. The $6 is the revenue from each customer, and the $2 is an expense. So the profit per customer would be 6 (revenue) minus 2 (gift cost) = $4 profit per customer.

Now, the fixed costs are $600 per week. So the total profit is the profit per customer times the number of customers minus the fixed costs. They want a profit of $1,000.

Let me set up the equation. Let x be the number of customers.

Total Profit = (Profit per customer) * x - Fixed Costs
1000 = (6 - 2) * x - 600
Which simplifies to 1000 = 4x - 600

Adding 600 to both sides: 1000 + 600 = 4x â†’ 1600 = 4x
Divide both sides by 4: x = 400.

Wait, that gives x = 400. So they need 400 customers to make a $1,000 profit.

Looking at the options, J is 400 customers. So the answer would be J.

To determine the number of customers needed to achieve a $1,000 weekly profit, we first calculate the total fixed costs: $500 (wages and electricity) + $100 (upkeep and miscellaneous) = $600. Each customer contributes $6 in revenue but incurs a $2 cost for a gift, resulting in a $4 profit per customer. The profit equation is:

\[
\text{Profit} = (\text{Revenue per customer} - \text{Cost per customer}) \times \text{Number of customers} - \text{Fixed costs}
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
1000 = (6 - 2) \times x - 600
\]

Simplifying:

\[
1000 = 4x - 600
\]

Adding 600 to both sides:

\[
1600 = 4x
\]

Dividing by 4:

\[
x = 400
\]

Thus, 400 customers are needed.
