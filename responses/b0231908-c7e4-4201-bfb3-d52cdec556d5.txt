Alright, so I've got this question about Brandt's version of utilitarianism. I'm a bit rusty on my ethics, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that utilitarianism generally is about consequences. The classic version, like what Bentham or Mill would say, is that an action is right if it produces the greatest good for the greatest number. So it's all about the outcomes, right?

Now, the question is specifically about Brandt's version. I think Brandt was a 20th-century philosopher who tried to defend utilitarianism against some common criticisms. One of the main points I recall is that he addressed the problem of moral motivation. He talked about "maxims," which are like principles that guide our actions. His idea was that a maxim is acceptable if it can be universalized, meaning if everyone followed it, it wouldn't lead to inconsistencies or worse outcomes.

Wait, but hold on. The question is asking what makes an action right according to Brandt. So, is it about whether the maxim can be universalized, or is it still about the consequences?

I think that Brandt's version is a form of rule utilitarianism. Rule utilitarians say that the rightness of an action depends on whether following the rule it embodies would produce the best consequences. So, it's not just the immediate consequences of each individual action, but the rules that, if followed, lead to the most happiness.

Looking at the options, option B is about whether one's maxim can be universalized. That sounds a bit like Kant's categorical imperative, where you test if a maxim can be a universal law. But I'm pretty sure Brandt's approach is more about the consequences of the rules, not just about universalizing the maxim itself.

Option E says the consequences of particular acts. That's more like act utilitarianism, which Brandt might not support because act utilitarianism can lead to problematic situations where the ends justify the means, even if it means breaking important rules or principles.

Option G is about ideal rules. That sounds closer to what I was thinking earlier. Rule utilitarians focus on the rules that, when followed, lead to the best overall outcomes. So if Brandt is defending a rule-based utilitarianism, then rightness would be a function of whether the action conforms to such ideal rules.

Let me double-check. Brandt's version is sometimes called "maximalism," where a maxim is acceptable if it's the best possible rule to follow. So, when evaluating an action, you consider the maxim (the rule) it's based on, and if that maxim could be a universal law without causing inconsistency or leading to worse outcomes, then it's right. So it's about the rule's consequences, not just the individual act's consequences.

So looking back at the options, G is "ideal rules." That means the rightness depends on whether the action follows the ideal rules that maximize overall happiness. So the answer should be G.

The version of utilitarianism that Brandt defends is a form of rule utilitarianism, where the rightness of an action is determined by whether it conforms to ideal rules that maximize overall happiness. These ideal rules are evaluated based on their consequences when universalized. Therefore, the correct answer is:

G: ideal rules.

The answer is G.
