Okay, so I have this question about the molarity of ethanol in 90-proof whiskey. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through step by step.

First, I remember that "proof" in alcohol terms is related to the percentage of ethanol by volume. I think the proof number is twice the percentage of ethanol. So if it's 90-proof, that means the ethanol is 45% by volume. Wait, is that right? Yeah, I think that's correct because 90 divided by 2 is 45. So ethanol makes up 45% of the volume of the whiskey.

Now, to find the molarity, I need to figure out how many moles of ethanol are in a liter of the solution. Molarity is moles per liter, so I need to calculate that.

I should probably start by considering a 1.00-liter sample of the whiskey. Since ethanol is 45% by volume, that means 0.45 liters of that liter is ethanol. The rest would be water, but I don't think I need that for the molarity of ethanol specifically.

Next, I need to find the mass of ethanol in those 0.45 liters. The density of ethanol is given as 0.8 g/mL. So I can calculate the mass by multiplying the volume (in mL) by the density. Wait, 0.45 liters is 450 mL. So mass = 450 mL * 0.8 g/mL. Let me do that: 450 * 0.8 equals 360 grams of ethanol.

Now, I need to convert grams to moles. The molar mass of ethanol (C2H5OH) is... let me see. Carbon is 12 g/mol, so 2 carbons would be 24. Hydrogen is 1, but ethanol has 6 H (from C2H5) and another OH which has another H, so 7 H in total? Wait, no, the formula is C2H5OH, which is C2H6O. Alternatively, sometimes written as C2H5OH, which is 2 carbons, 6 hydrogens, and one oxygen. So molar mass would be (2*12) + (6*1) + (16) = 24 + 6 +16 = 46 g/mol.

So, moles of ethanol = mass / molar mass = 360 g / 46 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 360 divided by 46 is approximately... let's see, 46*7=322, 46*8=368. So 360 is between 7 and 8. 360 - 322 = 38. So 38/46 is about 0.826. So total moles ≈ 7.826 mol.

Wait, but that's in 0.45 liters, right? Because the 45% was 0.45 liters. But we're considering a 1-liter solution. So to get the molarity, I need to find moles per liter. So if 0.45 liters gives me approximately 7.826 moles, then 1 liter would have (7.826 / 0.45) moles. Let me compute that: 7.826 divided by 0.45.

Hmm, 7.826 / 0.45. Let me do this division. 0.45 goes into 7.826 how many times? 0.45 *17 = 7.65, which leaves 0.176. 0.45 * 0.39 is about 0.1755. So total is about 17.39 moles per liter. Wait, that can't be right because looking at the options, the highest is 12.10 M. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait a second, maybe I messed up the calculation somewhere. Let me go back.

So the 90-proof means 45% ethanol by volume, correct. So 45% of the volume is ethanol. So 1 liter of whiskey contains 0.45 liters of ethanol.

Density of ethanol is 0.8 g/mL. So 0.45 liters is 450 mL. Mass of ethanol is 450 mL * 0.8 g/mL = 360 grams. That seems right.

Molar mass of ethanol is 46 g/mol. So moles = 360 /46 ≈ 7.826 moles in 0.45 liters.

Wait, but wait, 0.45 liters is 450 mL. So to find molarity, which is moles per liter, I need to calculate how many moles are in 1 liter. So if 0.45 liters gives 7.826 moles, then per liter it would be 7.826 / 0.45.

Let me recalculate that division. 7.826 divided by 0.45.

Let me write it as 7826 divided by 450. Hmm, 450 *17 = 7650. 7826 -7650 = 176. 450 goes into 176 about 0.39 times. So total is approximately 17.39 M. But that's way higher than the options given. The highest option is J: 10.50 M. So I must have a mistake here.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the proof. Let me double-check. Oh wait, maybe proof is the percentage by volume. So 90-proof is 45% ethanol by volume. That's correct. So that part seems right.

Wait another thought: perhaps the density given is for the solution, but the problem says "density of alcohol" is 0.8 g/ml. Oh, wait, the problem says "Density of alcohol = 0.8 g/ml." So I think that refers to ethanol's density, so that's correct.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something else. Let me think again.

Wait, I'm calculating the moles of ethanol in 0.45 liters, which is correct, and then scaling it up to 1 liter. But maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the total volume of the solution, but no, the problem is about the molarity in the solution, which is based on the ethanol's concentration.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the initial assumption about the molarity being based on the 1-liter solution. Wait, no, molarity is moles of solute per liter of solution. So if I have 0.45 liters of ethanol in 1 liter of solution, then the moles are 7.826 and the volume is 1 liter, so molarity is 7.826 M. Wait, but that doesn't match any of the options. Wait, let me check the options again.

Looking at the options: D is 7.83 M, which matches my calculation. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier when I thought I was getting 17 M. Wait, no, that was a miscalculation.

Wait, wait, I think I confused myself earlier. Let me re-express the steps clearly.

1. 90-proof means 45% ethanol by volume. So in 1 liter of whiskey, there's 0.45 liters of ethanol.

2. The mass of ethanol is 0.45 L * 1000 mL/L * 0.8 g/mL = 450 mL *0.8 g/mL = 360 grams.

Wait, no, wait: 0.45 liters is 450 mL. So mass=450 mL *0.8 g/mL= 360 grams. Correct.

3. Moles of ethanol = 360 g /46 g/mol ≈7.826 moles.

4. Since this is in 1 liter of solution (because we took 1 liter of whiskey), the molarity is 7.826 M. Which is option D:7.83 M.

So I think that's the correct answer. Earlier, I thought I was getting 17 M, which was a mistake because I was scaling up wrong. But actually, the 0.45 liters is part of the 1-liter solution, so the moles are already in 1 liter, giving 7.83 M.

Wait, but wait another thing. The density of the solution might be different from the density of pure ethanol. Because when you mix ethanol and water, the total volume can change. But in this problem, I think the percentage given is by volume, so the 45% is based on the total volume of the solution. So when I take 1 liter of the solution, 0.45 liters is ethanol, and the rest is water. But since the problem gives the density of ethanol, I think the approach is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider the total mass of the solution and then find the moles. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's necessary. Let me think: another approach could be to find the mass of ethanol in 1 liter of solution, then find moles.

Wait, but in 1 liter of solution, 0.45 liters is ethanol, so mass of ethanol is 0.45 L * 0.8 g/mL = 360 grams, as before. So moles are 360 /46 ≈7.826, which is 7.83 M, option D.

So I think the correct answer is D:7.83 M.

To determine the molarity of ethanol in 90-proof whiskey, we start by noting that "proof" indicates the percentage of ethanol by volume. Thus, 90-proof whiskey contains 45% ethanol by volume. This means that in 1 liter of whiskey, 0.45 liters (450 mL) is ethanol.

Next, we calculate the mass of ethanol in this volume. Using the density of ethanol (0.8 g/mL), the mass is:

\[
\text{Mass of ethanol} = 450 \, \text{mL} \times 0.8 \, \text{g/mL} = 360 \, \text{g}.
\]

The molar mass of ethanol (C₂H₅OH) is:

\[
\text{Molar mass of ethanol} = (2 \times 12) + (6 \times 1) + 16 = 46 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

The number of moles of ethanol is then:

\[
\text{Moles of ethanol} = \frac{360 \, \text{g}}{46 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 7.826 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Since this calculation is based on 1 liter of whiskey, the molarity of ethanol is:

\[
\text{Molarity} = \frac{7.826 \, \text{mol}}{1 \, \text{L}} = 7.83 \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the molarity of ethanol in 90-proof whiskey is **7.83 M**, corresponding to option D.
