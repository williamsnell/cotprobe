Question:

A husband and wife owned and operated a grocery store. The grocery store was situated in the first floor of the building in which the husband and wife occupied a second-floor apartment. Late one evening, the defendant was walking past the grocery store when he decided to steal the money he heard had been stashed in a cigar box inside the store. The defendant furtively walked to the rear of the building. He then proceeded to open the gate to the fenced-in back yard. Once inside the back yard, the defendant attempted to pry open the back window of the grocery store. Awakened by the barking of his watchdog, the husband went out onto his second- floor back porch and saw the defendant below. The husband yelled at the defendant. Startled, the defendant turned to run when he noticed a large package lying outside the rear door to the store. The defendant picked up the package, which contained baked bread that had been delivered earlier in the evening, and the defendant then ran off. Which of the following crimes will the defendant most likely be convicted of?

Options:

A: Burglary and theft.
B: Larceny and burglary.
C: Larceny.
D: Attempted burglary and theft.
E: Trespassing and attempted burglary.
F: Trespassing and larceny.
G: Burglary.
H: Attempted larceny.
I: Larceny and attempted burglary.
J: Trespassing, larceny and attempted burglary.

Alright, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about criminal law, specifically property crimes. The scenario involves a husband and wife who own a grocery store on the first floor of their building, where they live on the second floor. The defendant tried to steal money from the store, which was kept in a cigar box.

First, I need to break down what happened step by step. The defendant was walking past the store and decided to steal the money. He went to the rear of the building, opened the gate to the backyard, and tried to pry open the back window of the grocery store. While doing this, the husband heard his watchdog bark, went out on the second-floor porch, saw the defendant, and yelled at him. The defendant started running and picked up a package of baked bread that was outside the rear door, then ran away.

Now, I need to determine which crimes the defendant is most likely guilty of. The options include various combinations of burglary, larceny, trespassing, and other related charges.

Let's start by defining the key terms:

1. **Burglary**: Typically involves unlawful entry into a building with the intent to commit a felony inside. In some jurisdictions, it's the act of breaking into a building with the intent to commit theft or another felony.

2. **Larceny**: The unlawful taking and carrying away of someone else's property with the intent to permanently deprive them of it.

3. **Trespassing**: Entering someone's property without permission. It's a broader term and can include actions that don't necessarily involve intent to commit a felony, unlike burglary.

Looking at the scenario, the defendant's actions seem to involve several steps:

- He decided to steal the money.
- He went to the rear of the building, opened the gate, and tried to pry open a back window. This seems like an attempt to enter the store unlawfully, which could be considered burglary.
- While trying to enter, he was spotted, so he ran and took a package of bread. This taking of the bread would be larceny.

But let's think about each step in more detail.

First, the defendant's act of trying to pry open the back window. The store is on the first floor, and the husband lives on the second. When the husband saw the defendant, he was on the second-floor porch. The defendant was in the backyard, trying to get into the store. So, the store is a separate building from their residence? Or is it part of the same building? The way it's described, the store is on the first floor, and they live on the second. So, it's the same building.

In many jurisdictions, burglary requires breaking into a building that's a dwelling. But if the store is a commercial building, then entering it with intent to commit theft would still be burglary. Alternatively, if the intent is to commit theft, then the act of entering the store would constitute burglary.

But wait, the defendant didn't actually get into the store. He was caught before he could enter; he was attempting to pry open the window when the husband came out. So, did he successfully commit burglary, or was it just an attempt?

Burglary usually involves the act of unlawful entry. If he successfully enters, even a small part, that's enough. But if he's just attempting to enter, maybe it's attempted burglary.

However, in some places, the act of breaking and entering, even if not completed, is considered an attempt. Alternatively, the mere act of breaking in (like prying open a window) might be considered burglary as it's an unlawful entry with intent to commit a felony.

Next, the defendant took the package of baked bread. That's clearly larceny because he took someone else's property (the bread delivery was there) with the intent to keep it.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Burglary and theft. Theft is a more general term, which could include larceny. So this might be possible.

Option B: Larceny and burglary. This seems plausible because he committed both. But wait, did he commit burglary? Or was it just attempted burglary?

Option D: Attempted burglary and theft. If the burglary attempt didn't succeed, then perhaps this is the case.

Option I: Larceny and attempted burglary. That would mean he both committed larceny and tried to commit burglary.

But let's think again. Did he commit burglary or just attempt it? He was in the process of prying open the window. If the act of prying is considered an unlawful entry, then he might have committed burglary. Alternatively, if he didn't actually enter, it's just an attempt.

In some jurisdictions, the act of attempting to commit a felony inside a building can be considered burglary. For example, if someone enters a building with the intent to commit a felony, even if they don't complete the felony, it's still burglary.

So, if the defendant was in the process of entering the store with the intent to steal, that would be burglary. Then, when he took the bread, that's larceny.

Therefore, he would be guilty of both burglary and larceny. Looking at the options, option B is larceny and burglary. But wait, the order doesn't matter—burglary and larceny are separate crimes.

Wait, but the defendant was caught before entering the store. So, was the entry actually completed? If he was just trying to enter, perhaps it's attempted burglary, not completed burglary.

But in many jurisdictions, the act of breaking in (even if not fully entering) can constitute burglary. For example, if someone breaks a window to enter, that's enough for burglary, regardless of whether they complete the entry.

Alternatively, if the entry wasn't completed, it's attempted burglary.

This is a bit tricky. Let's consider the Model Penal Code approach. Under MPC, burglary is defined as entering a building with intent to commit a felony. So, if the defendant successfully entered, even a small part, it's burglary. If he couldn't enter (e.g., was stopped before), then it's an attempt.

In this case, the defendant was in the backyard, trying to open the window. He was seen by the husband, which stopped him. So, did he actually enter the store? It doesn't say he did. He was attempting to enter but was interrupted. So perhaps he didn't complete the entry, making it attempted burglary.

Then, the larceny would be the taking of the bread.

So, the crimes would be attempted burglary and larceny. Looking at the options, option D is attempted burglary and theft, which is similar. But theft is a broader term; larceny is a specific type. So perhaps option F is trespassing and larceny, but I'm not sure about trespassing here.

Wait, trespassing is just entering without permission. Burglary is more specific—unlawful entry with intent to commit a felony. So, if he was attempting to commit burglary, then the trespassing might be a lesser included offense, but the main charge would be attempted burglary.

Alternatively, if the entry wasn't successful, he might be charged with attempted burglary and larceny (for the bread). So, that would be option I: larceny and attempted burglary. But option I is listed as such.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A: Burglary and theft.

B: Larceny and burglary.

C: Larceny.

D: Attempted burglary and theft.

E: Trespassing and attempted burglary.

F: Trespassing and larceny.

G: Burglary.

H: Attempted larceny.

I: Larceny and attempted burglary.

J: Trespassing, larceny, and attempted burglary.

So, if the defendant didn't successfully enter the store, then he attempted burglary. Then, he committed larceny by taking the bread. So, the charges would be attempted burglary and larceny.

Looking at the options, that's option I: larceny and attempted burglary. Or option D: attempted burglary and theft. But theft is a more general term, so larceny is more precise.

Alternatively, perhaps the defendant committed both larceny (the bread) and burglary (the attempted entry into the store). Or maybe the attempted burglary is part of the larceny.

Wait, another angle: when he took the bread, was that part of the same criminal episode? He was attempting to commit burglary (steal the money) and then, while fleeing, took the bread. So, two separate crimes: attempted burglary and larceny.

So, the defendant would be guilty of both. Looking at the options, option I is larceny and attempted burglary. That fits.

Alternatively, if the entry was considered completed, then he committed burglary and larceny. But I think he didn't actually enter because he was stopped. So, it's attempted burglary.

Therefore, the correct answer would be option I: larceny and attempted burglary.

The defendant attempted to commit burglary by unlawfully entering the grocery store with the intent to steal but was interrupted. Additionally, he committed larceny by taking the package of baked bread. Therefore, the defendant is most likely guilty of larceny and attempted burglary.
