Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the physics, but I'll do my best.

So, the problem is about a pontoon bridge that's 10 feet wide and 50 yards wide. Wait, wait, actually, the river is 50 yards wide, right? So the bridge is 10 feet wide, but the river is 50 yards. I need to make sure I'm using consistent units here.

Twelve identical trucks cross the bridge at the same time, and the bridge sinks 1 foot. I need to find the weight of one truck. The density of water is given as 1.94 slugs per cubic foot. The options are in pounds, so I think the answer will be in pounds.

Hmm, okay, so the key here is probably buoyancy and the force exerted by the water on the bridge when the trucks are on it. When the trucks are on the bridge, they displace water, causing the bridge to sink. The weight of the trucks must equal the weight of the water displaced.

Wait, I remember that buoyant force equals the weight of the displaced fluid. So, the total weight of the trucks is equal to the weight of the water displaced when the bridge sinks 1 foot.

But wait, how much water is displaced? The bridge is 10 feet wide, but the river is 50 yards wide. Oh, wait, the bridge is 10 ft wide, so maybe that's the length along the river? Or is the bridge's width perpendicular to the river's flow? I think I need to clarify that.

Wait, the river is 50 yards wide. So the bridge is 10 ft wide, which I should convert to yards because the river's width is in yards. Let me convert 10 ft to yards: since 1 yard is 3 ft, 10 ft is 10/3 ≈ 3.333 yards. So the bridge is 3.333 yards wide, and the river is 50 yards wide. So the bridge is much narrower than the river.

Wait, but when the trucks cross the bridge, they are on the bridge, which is 10 ft wide. So perhaps the submerged part is the area under the bridge? Or maybe the bridge itself is floating, and when the trucks are on it, it displaces water, causing it to sink 1 ft.

Wait, the bridge is a pontoon bridge, which typically floats on the water. So when the trucks are on it, the bridge sags, pushing water out of the way. The volume of water displaced would be equal to the area submerged times the length of the bridge, but I'm not sure about the length.

Wait, the bridge is 10 ft wide, but how long is it? Wait, the river is 50 yards wide, so the bridge must span the river, so its length would be 50 yards. Because the bridge goes across the river, right? So the bridge is 50 yards long and 10 ft wide.

Wait, but we need consistent units. Let me convert 50 yards to feet. 50 yards * 3 ft/yard = 150 ft. So the bridge is 150 ft long and 10 ft wide. So its cross-sectional area when submerged would be 10 ft (width) * 1 ft (the sink depth) = 10 cubic feet per linear foot? Wait, no, the submerged depth is 1 ft, so the volume displaced would be the area of the submerged part times the length of the bridge.

Wait, the bridge sinks 1 ft, so the submerged depth is 1 ft. The area submerged is the width of the bridge times the sink depth. So area = 10 ft * 1 ft = 10 sq ft. But wait, no, that's not right. Because the bridge is a certain length, the submerged volume would be the submerged area times the length.

Wait, the bridge is 150 ft long, 10 ft wide, and when it sinks 1 ft, the submerged part is a rectangular prism with length 150 ft, width 10 ft, and height 1 ft. So the volume displaced is 150 * 10 * 1 = 1500 cubic feet.

Wait, that makes sense. So the volume displaced is 1500 cubic feet. Then, the weight of the displaced water is density * volume * g, where g is the acceleration due to gravity. But wait, in the units given, density is in slugs per cubic foot, which is mass per volume. So the weight would be density * volume * g. But wait, in the English system, weight is mass (slugs) times acceleration (ft/s²). But since we're given density as 1.94 slugs/ft³, and we're to find weight in pounds, which is slugs * ft/s².

Wait, but 1 slug is 32.174 pounds, because 1 slug = 1 lb·s²/ft. So, the weight of the displaced water would be (density) * volume * g, where g is 32.174 ft/s².

So, let's compute that. Volume is 1500 ft³. Density is 1.94 slugs/ft³. So mass is 1.94 * 1500 = 2910 slugs. Then weight is mass * g = 2910 * 32.174 lb. Let me calculate that.

Wait, but wait a second, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, since density is given as 1.94 slugs/ft³, and 1 slug is approximately 32.174 pounds, so the weight density (weight per volume) would be 1.94 * 32.174 ≈ 62.42 lb/ft³ (since water's weight density is about 62.4 lb/ft³, which matches with this calculation). So maybe I can just use 62.4 lb/ft³ as the weight density.

So, if I use that, the weight of the displaced water is 62.4 lb/ft³ * 1500 ft³ = 62.4 * 1500 = 93,600 lb.

That's the total weight of the displaced water, which equals the total weight of the trucks. Since there are twelve trucks, each truck's weight would be 93,600 / 12 = 7,800 lb.

Wait, but looking at the options, 7,800 isn't one of them. The options are A:9000, B:7760, C:8850, D:7000, E:9500, F:8600, G:8200, H:6500, I:8100, J:7300.

Hmm, 7,800 isn't listed. So maybe I made a mistake in my calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the volume calculation. Let me go through it again.

The bridge is 150 ft long (since 50 yards = 150 ft), 10 ft wide, and sinks 1 ft. So the submerged volume is 150 * 10 * 1 = 1500 ft³. That seems correct.

Density is 1.94 slugs/ft³. So the mass is 1.94 * 1500 = 2910 slugs.

Weight is mass * g = 2910 * 32.174 ≈ ?

Let me compute that more accurately. 2910 * 32 = 93,120. 2910 * 0.174 = approx 507.54. So total is 93,120 + 507.54 ≈ 93,627.54 lb.

Divided by 12 trucks: 93,627.54 / 12 ≈ 7,802.295 lb per truck.

Hmm, that's about 7,800 lb, which isn't an option. The closest options are B:7760 and J:7300. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the units somewhere.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the bridge's width is 10 ft, and the river is 50 yards wide, so the bridge's length is 50 yards, which is 150 ft. So when the bridge sinks 1 ft, the submerged volume is length * width * depth = 150 * 10 * 1 = 1500 ft³.

But maybe I should consider the area submerged differently. Wait, is the bridge resting on supports, and only a certain part is submerged? Or perhaps the entire bridge is floating, and the 1 ft sink is the additional depth due to the trucks.

Wait, perhaps the initial submerged depth is some amount, and the trucks add 1 ft to that. But the problem says the bridge sinks 1 ft when the trucks cross, so I think it's the total sink is 1 ft. So the displaced volume is 1500 ft³ as before.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value for g. Let me calculate it more precisely.

Density is 1.94 slugs/ft³. Volume is 1500 ft³. So mass is 1.94 * 1500 = 2910 slugs.

Weight is mass * g. Since 1 slug = 32.174 lb·s²/ft, so 1 slug weighs 32.174 lb. So total weight is 2910 * 32.174.

Let me compute that:

2910 * 32 = 93,120.

2910 * 0.174 = ?

0.1 * 2910 = 291.

0.07 * 2910 = 203.7.

0.004 * 2910 = 11.64.

Adding those: 291 + 203.7 = 494.7 + 11.64 = 506.34.

So total weight is 93,120 + 506.34 = 93,626.34 lb.

Divide by 12: 93,626.34 / 12 ≈ 7,802.195 lb.

Hmm, still around 7,800 lb. But the options don't have that. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the volume calculation.

Wait, wait a second. The problem says the bridge is 10 ft wide, but perhaps the width refers to the length of the bridge, and the river is 50 yards wide, so the bridge's length is 50 yards. Let me check that.

If the bridge is 10 ft wide, that's 10 ft in one direction, and the river is 50 yards wide, so the bridge's length would be 50 yards, which is 150 ft. So the bridge is 150 ft long and 10 ft wide. So the submerged volume when it sinks 1 ft is 150 * 10 * 1 = 1500 ft³.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the displacement is only for the area under the trucks. Wait, but the problem says twelve trucks cross simultaneously, so they are all on the bridge at the same time, so the entire bridge sags 1 ft, displacing that volume.

Wait, maybe I should consider the area submerged per truck. Each truck would cause a certain displacement. But since all twelve are on the bridge at the same time, the total displacement is 1500 ft³, so each truck displaces 1500 / 12 = 125 ft³.

Wait, but that approach might not be correct because the bridge's displacement is a function of the total load, not per truck. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem is that I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think again.

The buoyant force equals the weight of the displaced water. So the total weight of the trucks is equal to the buoyant force, which is the weight of the displaced water.

So, total weight of trucks = density_water * volume_displaced * g.

Where density_water is 1.94 slugs/ft³, volume_displaced is 1500 ft³, and g is 32.174 ft/s².

So, total weight = 1.94 * 1500 * 32.174.

Let me compute that:

1.94 * 1500 = 2910.

2910 * 32.174 = ?

Again, 2910 * 32 = 93,120.

2910 * 0.174 = 506.34.

Total: 93,120 + 506.34 = 93,626.34 lb.

Divide by 12: 93,626.34 / 12 ≈ 7,802 lb per truck.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe the bridge's width is 10 ft, but the trucks are only over a portion of it, so perhaps the submerged volume is different. Wait, but the problem says twelve trucks cross simultaneously, so they're all on the bridge, which is 10 ft wide. So perhaps each truck is spaced out along the 150 ft length, so the submerged volume per truck is (10 ft width) * (1 ft depth) * (length per truck). Wait, but I don't know the spacing. Alternatively, perhaps each truck's weight causes a certain local displacement, but since they're all on the bridge, the total displacement is as calculated.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me check again.

Density is 1.94 slugs/ft³. Volume is 1500 ft³. So mass is 1.94 * 1500 = 2910 slugs.

Weight is mass * g: 2910 * 32.174 lb. Let me compute that more accurately.

32.174 * 2910:

32 * 2910 = 93,120.

0.174 * 2910 = let's compute 0.1 *2910=291, 0.07*2910=203.7, 0.004*2910=11.64. Sum: 291+203.7=494.7+11.64=506.34.

Total: 93,120 + 506.34 = 93,626.34 lb.

Divide by 12: 93,626.34 / 12 = 7,802.195 lb.

Hmm, still not matching any options. Let me check the options again: the closest lower is B:7760, and the next is J:7300.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the volume. Let me think again: is the submerged volume 10 ft wide, 150 ft long, and 1 ft deep? Yes, that's 1500 ft³.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the bridge's cross-sectional area is 10 ft wide, but when it sinks 1 ft, the submerged volume is 10 ft (width) * 1 ft (depth) * length of bridge (150 ft) = 1500 ft³. So that part seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the bridge is 10 ft wide, and the river is 50 yards wide, but the bridge's length is 50 yards, which is 150 ft. So the submerged volume is 10 ft * 150 ft * 1 ft = 1500 ft³.

Alternatively, perhaps the bridge's width is 10 ft, and the river is 50 yards wide, so the bridge's width is along the river's width, and the length of the bridge is the same as the river's width? Or perhaps I've mixed up width and length.

Wait, perhaps the bridge is 10 ft wide (perpendicular to the river flow), and the river is 50 yards wide, so the bridge's length is 50 yards, which is 150 ft. So when the bridge sinks 1 ft, the submerged volume is 150 ft (length) * 10 ft (width) * 1 ft (depth) = 1500 ft³.

Yes, that's correct. So the displaced volume is 1500 ft³.

Wait, maybe I should use the exact value for g, which is 32.174 ft/s², but perhaps the problem expects a rounded value, like 32 ft/s², which would give a slightly lower weight.

Let me try that. So, 2910 slugs * 32 ft/s² = 2910 * 32 = 93,120 lb.

Divide by 12: 93,120 / 12 = 7,760 lb.

Ah! Now that's option B:7760 lb.

So that must be the correct answer. I think I overcomplicated it by using the precise value of g. Probably, the problem expects using g as 32 ft/s² for simplicity, leading to 7,760 lb per truck.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the weight of one truck based on the buoyant force exerted by the displaced water when twelve trucks cross a pontoon bridge, causing it to sink 1 foot. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Convert Units**: The river is 50 yards wide, which converts to 150 feet. The bridge is 10 feet wide, so its dimensions are 150 feet long and 10 feet wide.

2. **Volume of Displaced Water**: When the bridge sinks 1 foot, the submerged volume is a rectangular prism with dimensions 150 ft (length) × 10 ft (width) × 1 ft (depth), giving a volume of 1500 cubic feet.

3. **Weight of Displaced Water**: The density of water is 1.94 slugs/ft³, and the weight density (weight per volume) is approximately 62.4 lb/ft³. Using this, the total weight of the displaced water is:
   \[
   62.4 \, \text{lb/ft}^3 \times 1500 \, \text{ft}^3 = 93,600 \, \text{lb}.
   \]

4. **Weight of Twelve Trucks**: The total weight of the twelve trucks equals the weight of the displaced water, which is 93,600 lb.

5. **Weight of One Truck**: Dividing the total weight by the number of trucks:
   \[
   \frac{93,600 \, \text{lb}}{12} = 7,800 \, \text{lb}.
   \]

6. **Adjusting for Units**: Using \( g = 32 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \) instead of the exact value slightly reduces the weight, leading to approximately 7,760 lb per truck.

Thus, the weight of one truck is **7,760 lb**, corresponding to option B.
