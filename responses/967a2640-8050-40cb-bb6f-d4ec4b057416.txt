Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the slowest wind speed a hurricane can have according to the Saffir-Simpson scale. I've heard about this scale before; it's used to categorize the strength of hurricanes. But I'm not exactly sure about the details, so I'll have to think it through.

First, I remember that the Saffir-Simpson scale divides hurricanes into categories based on wind speed. There are five categories, right? I think each category corresponds to a range of wind speeds. The higher the category, the stronger the hurricane.

I think the scale starts at Category 1 and goes up to Category 5. So, the slowest wind speed would be the minimum for Category 1. But wait, I'm not 100% certain about the exact numbers.

I recall that Category 1 is the weakest, and then each category increases the wind speed threshold. I think the wind speeds are in miles per hour (mph). Let me try to remember the ranges.

I think Category 1 starts at around 74 mph. I've heard that 74 mph is the lower end, and it goes up from there. So, for example, Category 2 might start around 95 mph, and so on. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact numbers for each category.

Looking at the options provided, the choices are A: 120 mph, B:85, C:80, D:50, E:65, F:74, G:96, H:90, I:100, J:110. So the question is asking for the slowest, which would be the minimum for Category 1.

Wait, I'm pretty sure that the Saffir-Simpson scale defines a Category 1 hurricane as having sustained winds of 74 mph or higher, but less than 95 mph. So the slowest would be 74 mph because that's the starting point. So the answer should be F:74 mph.

I don't think it's any lower than that because anything below 74 mph wouldn't be classified as a hurricane under this scale. Maybe it would be a tropical storm instead. So, the options below 74 are D:50, E:65, and C:80. Wait, 80 is close but I think 74 is the exact cutoff.

So, the correct answer should be F:74 mph.

The Saffir-Simpson scale categorizes hurricanes based on their wind speeds, with Category 1 being the weakest. The minimum wind speed for a Category 1 hurricane is 74 mph. Therefore, the slowest wind speed a hurricane can have according to this scale is 74 mph.
