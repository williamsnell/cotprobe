Okay, so I have this problem where I need to calculate the heat absorbed, ΔH, at constant pressure when one mole of nitrogen gas (N₂) is heated from 25°C to 150°C. The heat capacity at constant pressure, C_P, is given as a function of temperature: C_P = 6.76 + 0.606 × 10^-3 T + 1.3 × 10^-7 T^2, and the units are cal/(K·mol). The options given are all in joules per mole, so I'll probably need to convert from calories to joules at the end.

First, I remember that when heat is absorbed at constant pressure, the change in enthalpy ΔH is equal to the integral of C_P dT from the initial temperature to the final temperature. So the formula I think I should use is:

ΔH = ∫(T_initial to T_final) C_P dT

Since C_P is a function of temperature, I can't just multiply C_P by the temperature change. Instead, I need to integrate the given expression for C_P with respect to T between 298 K and 423 K.

Let me write out the integral:

ΔH = ∫ (6.76 + 0.606e-3 T + 1.3e-7 T²) dT from 298 to 423.

Breaking this integral into parts, I can integrate each term separately.

The integral of a constant a is a*T. The integral of b*T is (b/2) T². The integral of c*T² is (c/3) T³.

So integrating term by term:

∫6.76 dT = 6.76 * T

∫0.606e-3 T dT = 0.606e-3 * (T² / 2)

∫1.3e-7 T² dT = 1.3e-7 * (T³ / 3)

So putting it all together, the integral from T1 to T2 is:

[6.76*(T2 - T1) + 0.606e-3*( (T2² - T1²)/2 ) + 1.3e-7*( (T2³ - T1³)/3 ) ] 

Now plug in T1 = 298 K and T2 = 423 K.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute T2 - T1: 423 - 298 = 125 K.

So first term: 6.76 * 125 = let me calculate that. 6 * 125 = 750, 0.76 *125=95, so total is 750 +95=845 cal/mol.

Wait, but wait, the units for C_P are cal/(K·mol), so the integral gives cal/mol.

Wait, but we need to convert to joules. 1 cal = 4.184 J. So after calculating the total in calories, I'll multiply by 4.184 to get joules.

But let me finish the integral first.

Second term: 0.606e-3 * ( (423² - 298²)/2 )

Let me compute 423² and 298².

423²: 423 *423. Let's see, 400² is 160000, 23² is 529, and cross terms 2*400*23=18400. So 160000 + 18400 +529 = 178,929.

298²: 298 *298. 300²=90000, subtract 2*300*2=1200, add 2²=4. So 90000 - 1200 +4 = 88804.

So 423² -298² = 178929 - 88804 = 90,125.

Divide by 2: 90,125 /2 = 45,062.5.

Multiply by 0.606e-3: 0.000606 * 45062.5.

Let me compute 0.000606 * 45,062.5.

First, 45,062.5 * 0.0006 = 27.0375.

45,062.5 * 0.000006 = 0.270375.

Adding them: 27.0375 + 0.270375 ≈ 27.307875 cal/mol.

Wait, but that's the second term.

Third term: 1.3e-7 * ( (423³ - 298³)/3 )

Compute 423³ and 298³.

423³: 423 *423*423. Hmm, this is a bit tedious.

Alternatively, 423³ = (400 + 23)^3. Using binomial expansion:

= 400³ + 3*(400²)*23 + 3*400*(23²) +23³

400³=64,000,000.

3*(400²)*23 = 3*(160,000)*23 = 3*3,680,000 = 11,040,000.

3*400*(23²) = 3*400*529 = 1200 *529 = 634,800.

23³=12,167.

Add them up: 64,000,000 +11,040,000=75,040,000; +634,800=75,674,800; +12,167=75,686,967.

So 423³ ≈75,686,967.

298³: 298*298*298.

Again, (300-2)^3.

=300³ -3*300²*2 +3*300*(2²) -2³.

300³=27,000,000.

3*300²*2=3*90,000 *2=540,000.

3*300*(4)=3*1200=3,600.

2³=8.

So 298³ = 27,000,000 -540,000 +3,600 -8.

=27,000,000 -540,000=26,460,000.

26,460,000 +3,600=26,463,600.

26,463,600 -8=26,463,592.

So 298³≈26,463,592.

So 423³ -298³ =75,686,967 -26,463,592=49,223,375.

Divide by 3:49,223,375 /3≈16,407,791.6667.

Multiply by 1.3e-7: 1.3e-7 *16,407,791.6667.

Compute 16,407,791.6667 *1.3e-7.

Let me compute 16,407,791.6667 *1.3 = approx 21,330,129.1667.

Then multiply by 1e-7: 21,330,129.1667 *1e-7≈0.21330129167 cal/mol.

So the third term is approximately 0.2133 cal/mol.

Now sum all three terms:

First term: 845 cal/mol.

Second term: 27.307875 cal/mol.

Third term: 0.2133 cal/mol.

Adding these together: 845 +27.307875=872.307875 +0.2133=872.521175 cal/mol.

So ΔH ≈872.5212 cal/mol.

Now, convert calories to joules. 1 cal =4.184 J.

872.5212 cal *4.184 J/cal ≈ ?

Let me compute 800 *4.184=3347.2.

72.5212 *4.184: let's compute that.

70 *4.184=292.88.

2.5212 *4.184≈10.55.

So 292.88 +10.55=303.43.

Total is 3347.2 +303.43=3650.63 J/mol.

Looking at the options, option C is 3658.6 J/mol, which is close. Hmm, but my calculation is 3650.63, which is about 3650.6 J/mol. The closest option is C:3658.6. There might be slight discrepancies due to rounding in intermediate steps.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me double-check the second term.

Second term: 0.606e-3 * (45,062.5).

0.000606 *45,062.5.

I think I can compute it more accurately.

45,062.5 * 0.000606.

Let me compute 45,062.5 * 0.0006 =27.0375.

45,062.5 *0.000006=0.270375.

Adding them gives 27.0375 +0.270375=27.307875 cal/mol. That seems correct.

Third term: 0.2133 cal/mol. That seems right.

So total in cal is 872.5212 cal, which is 872.5212 *4.184 = ?

Let me compute accurately:

872.5212 *4.184.

Break it down:

800 *4.184=3347.2.

70 *4.184=292.88.

2.5212 *4.184≈ 10.545.

So 3347.2 +292.88=3640.08 +10.545=3650.625 J.

So 3650.63 J.

The option C is 3658.6 J, which is about 8 J higher. Maybe I made a calculation error in the cubic term.

Wait, let me recheck the cubic term.

423^3: 423 *423 = 178,929. Then 178,929 *423.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 423^3 more accurately.

Let me compute 423 *423 = 178,929.

Then 178,929 *423:

= 178,929 * 400 = 71,571,600.

178,929 *20 =3,578,580.

178,929 *3=536,787.

Adding these together:71,571,600 +3,578,580=75,150,180 +536,787=75,686,967. So that's correct.

298^3:26,463,592. So 423^3 -298^3=75,686,967-26,463,592=49,223,375.

Divide by 3:49,223,375 /3=16,407,791.6667.

Multiply by 1.3e-7: 1.3 *16,407,791.6667=21,330,129.1667.

21,330,129.1667 *1e-7=0.21330129167 cal/mol.

Hmm, that seems correct.

Wait, perhaps I should carry more decimal places during the integration steps.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects using average C_P over the temperature range. Let's think: sometimes, when C_P varies with T, people approximate by taking the average C_P multiplied by the temperature change.

But the given C_P is a quadratic function, so integrating is more accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the first term. Let me recheck: 6.76 * (423 -298)=6.76 *125=845 cal/mol. That's correct.

So the sum is 845 +27.307875 +0.2133≈872.5212 cal/mol.

Converting to J: 872.5212 *4.184.

Let me compute it precisely:

872.5212 *4.184.

Let me break it down:

800 *4.184=3347.2.

70 *4.184=292.88.

2.5212 *4.184.

Compute 2 *4.184=8.368.

0.5212 *4.184≈2.181.

So total for 2.5212 is 8.368 +2.181=10.549.

Now add all parts: 3347.2 +292.88=3640.08 +10.549=3650.629 J/mol.

So around 3650.63 J/mol.

Looking at the options, option C is 3658.6 J/mol, which is close but 8 J higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the second term. Let me recheck the calculations.

Second term: 0.606e-3 * ( (423^2 -298^2)/2 )

423^2=178,929; 298^2=88,804. The difference is 178,929 -88,804=90,125.

Divide by 2:45,062.5.

Multiply by 0.606e-3:0.000606 *45,062.5.

Let me compute 45,062.5 *0.0006=27.0375.

45,062.5 *0.000006=0.270375.

Total=27.0375 +0.270375=27.307875 cal/mol. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should carry more decimal places in the third term.

Third term:1.3e-7 * (423^3 -298^3)/3.

We have (423³ -298³)=49,223,375.

Divide by 3:49,223,375 /3=16,407,791.6666667.

Multiply by 1.3e-7.

16,407,791.6666667 *1.3=21,330,129.1666667.

Multiply by 1e-7: 0.2133012916667 cal/mol.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses more precise values, like not approximating the cube terms.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the integral more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact expression and compute it as a function.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use Simpson's rule for integration, but that might be more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the options have a typo, and the correct answer is around 3650 J, but the closest option is C:3658.6, which is 8 J higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the first term.

Wait, 6.76 *125=845, that's correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the entire integral without breaking it into parts.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each term with more precision.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer expects using the average C_P over the temperature range multiplied by the temperature change.

Let me try that approach as a check.

Compute average C_P between T1=298 K and T2=423 K.

C_P(T) =6.76 +0.000606 T +1.3e-7 T².

Average C_P ≈ (C_P(T1) + C_P(T2))/2.

Compute C_P at T1=298:

6.76 +0.000606*298 +1.3e-7*(298)^2.

Compute each part:

0.000606 *298=0.606e-3 *298=0.180468.

1.3e-7*(298)^2=1.3e-7 *88,804= (1.3 *88,804) *1e-7.

1.3 *88,804=115,445.2.

115,445.2 *1e-7=0.01154452.

So C_P(T1)=6.76 +0.180468 +0.01154452=6.76 +0.19201252≈6.95201252 cal/(K·mol).

Similarly, C_P(T2)=6.76 +0.000606*423 +1.3e-7*(423)^2.

Compute each part:

0.000606*423=0.255858.

1.3e-7*(423)^2=1.3e-7*178,929= (1.3*178,929)*1e-7.

1.3 *178,929=232,607.7.

232,607.7 *1e-7≈0.2326077.

So C_P(T2)=6.76 +0.255858 +0.2326077≈6.76 +0.4884657≈7.2484657 cal/(K·mol).

Average C_P=(6.95201252 +7.2484657)/2≈(14.20047822)/2≈7.10023911 cal/(K·mol).

Then ΔH= average C_P * (T2 - T1)=7.10023911 *125≈887.52989 cal/mol.

Convert to J: 887.52989 *4.184≈?

Compute 800 *4.184=3347.2.

87.52989 *4.184.

Compute 80 *4.184=334.72.

7.52989 *4.184≈31.42.

So 334.72 +31.42=366.14.

Total ΔH≈3347.2 +366.14=3713.34 J/mol.

This is higher than the previous calculation. But this method isn't as accurate because the average method is less precise for non-linear functions. The correct approach is integration, which gave me around 3650 J, but the closest option is C:3658.6 J.

Wait, maybe I should compute the integral more accurately, perhaps using more precise intermediate values.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator for the integrals.

Wait, let me compute each integral more precisely.

First term: 6.76*(423 -298)=6.76*125=845 cal/mol.

Second term: 0.606e-3 * [ (423^2 -298^2)/2 ].

We have (423^2 -298^2)=90,125.

So (90,125)/2=45,062.5.

0.606e-3 =0.000606.

0.000606 *45,062.5.

Compute 45,062.5 *0.0006=27.0375.

45,062.5 *0.000006=0.270375.

Total=27.0375 +0.270375=27.307875 cal/mol.

Third term:1.3e-7 * [ (423^3 -298^3 ) /3 ].

As before, 423^3=75,686,967; 298^3=26,463,592.

Difference=49,223,375.

Divide by 3:16,407,791.6667.

Multiply by 1.3e-7:1.3e-7 *16,407,791.6667.

Compute 16,407,791.6667 *1.3 =21,330,129.1667.

Multiply by 1e-7:0.21330129167 cal/mol.

Sum all three:845 +27.307875=872.307875 +0.21330129167=872.52117629 cal/mol.

Convert to J:872.52117629 *4.184=?

Let me compute this precisely.

872.52117629 *4.184.

Break it down:

800 *4.184=3347.2.

72.52117629 *4.184.

Compute 70 *4.184=292.88.

2.52117629 *4.184≈10.546.

So 72.52117629 *4.184≈292.88 +10.546=303.426.

Total ΔH=3347.2 +303.426=3650.626 J/mol.

So approximately 3650.63 J/mol.

Looking at the options, option C is 3658.6 J/mol, which is very close. The slight difference might be due to rounding during intermediate steps or perhaps a more precise calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the problem requires using more precise values for the constants or perhaps using the exact integral without approximations.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise calculations for the third term.

Let me recompute the third term.

Third term:

1.3e-7 * (423^3 -298^3)/3.

Compute 423^3=75,686,967.

298^3=26,463,592.

Difference=75,686,967 -26,463,592=49,223,375.

Divide by 3:49,223,375 /3=16,407,791.66666667.

Multiply by 1.3e-7:1.3 *16,407,791.66666667=21,330,129.16666667.

Multiply by 1e-7:0.2133012916666667 cal/mol.

So that's accurate.

Thus, after all, the total is 872.52117629 cal/mol.

Converting to J: 872.52117629 *4.184=?

Let me compute 872.52117629 *4.184.

Compute step by step:

872.52117629 *4 =3,489.08470516.

872.52117629 *0.184.

Compute 872.52117629 *0.1=87.252117629.

872.52117629 *0.08=69.8016941032.

872.52117629 *0.004=3.49008470516.

Add them:87.252117629 +69.8016941032=157.0538117322 +3.49008470516=160.54389643736.

So total ΔH=3,489.08470516 +160.54389643736=3,649.62860159736 J/mol.

Rounded to four decimal places, it's 3,649.63 J/mol.

Looking at the options again, option C is 3,658.6 J/mol, which is about 9 J higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of C_P(T1) and C_P(T2). Let me recheck.

Wait, no, the integral approach is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the options have a typo, or perhaps I should consider that the problem uses more precise values for the constants.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C:3658.6 J/mol, considering possible rounding in the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps I should carry more decimal places in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value without approximating.

Let me compute 872.52117629 *4.184 precisely.

872.52117629 *4.184.

Let me compute this using a more precise method.

Let me write 4.184 as 4 +0.1 +0.08 +0.004.

Compute:

872.52117629 *4=3,489.08470516.

872.52117629 *0.1=87.252117629.

872.52117629 *0.08=69.8016941032.

872.52117629 *0.004=3.49008470516.

Now add them all together:

3,489.08470516

+87.252117629 =3,576.33682279

+69.8016941032=3,646.13851689

+3.49008470516=3,649.628601595 J.

So approximately 3,649.629 J/mol.

The closest option is C:3,658.6 J/mol, which is about 9 J higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the second term. Let me recompute the second term.

Second term: 0.606e-3 * ( (423^2 -298^2)/2 ).

423^2=178,929; 298^2=88,804.

Difference=90,125.

Divide by 2=45,062.5.

Multiply by 0.000606:

45,062.5 *0.000606.

Compute 45,062.5 *0.0006=27.0375.

45,062.5 *0.000006=0.270375.

Total=27.0375 +0.270375=27.307875 cal/mol.

That's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the options are using a slightly different approximation, or perhaps I missed a term.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects using the molar specific heat capacity at constant pressure as a constant, but that's not the case here because C_P varies with T.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using C_P as an average value over the temperature range, but that would be less accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the integral in a different way.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each term with more precise decimal places.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that the closest option is C:3,658.6 J/mol, given possible rounding in intermediate steps.

To calculate the heat absorbed, ΔH, at constant pressure when one mole of nitrogen gas (N₂) is heated from 25°C (298 K) to 150°C (423 K), we use the given heat capacity at constant pressure:

\[
C_P = 6.76 + 0.606 \times 10^{-3}T + 1.3 \times 10^{-7}T^2 \, \text{cal K}^{-1} \text{mol}^{-1}
\]

The change in enthalpy is calculated by integrating \( C_P \) with respect to temperature over the given range:

\[
\Delta H = \int_{T_1}^{T_2} C_P \, dT
\]

Breaking the integral into three parts:

1. **First term**:  
   \[
   \int 6.76 \, dT = 6.76 \times (T_2 - T_1) = 6.76 \times 125 = 845 \, \text{cal/mol}
   \]

2. **Second term**:  
   \[
   \int 0.606 \times 10^{-3} T \, dT = 0.606 \times 10^{-3} \times \frac{T_2^2 - T_1^2}{2}
   \]
   - \( T_2^2 = 423^2 = 178,929 \, \text{K}^2 \)
   - \( T_1^2 = 298^2 = 88,804 \, \text{K}^2 \)
   - \( T_2^2 - T_1^2 = 90,125 \, \text{K}^2 \)
   - \[
     \frac{90,125}{2} = 45,062.5 \, \text{K}^2
     \]
   - \[
     0.606 \times 10^{-3} \times 45,062.5 = 27.307875 \, \text{cal/mol}
     \]

3. **Third term**:  
   \[
   \int 1.3 \times 10^{-7} T^2 \, dT = 1.3 \times 10^{-7} \times \frac{T_2^3 - T_1^3}{3}
   \]
   - \( T_2^3 = 423^3 = 75,686,967 \, \text{K}^3 \)
   - \( T_1^3 = 298^3 = 26,463,592 \, \text{K}^3 \)
   - \( T_2^3 - T_1^3 = 49,223,375 \, \text{K}^3 \)
   - \[
     \frac{49,223,375}{3} = 16,407,791.67 \, \text{K}^3
     \]
   - \[
     1.3 \times 10^{-7} \times 16,407,791.67 = 0.2133 \, \text{cal/mol}
     \]

Summing all three terms:

\[
\Delta H = 845 + 27.307875 + 0.2133 = 872.521175 \, \text{cal/mol}
\]

Converting calories to joules (\( 1 \, \text{cal} = 4.184 \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta H = 872.521175 \times 4.184 = 3650.63 \, \text{J/mol}
\]

The closest option to this value is **C: 3658.6 J/mol**. Minor discrepancies may arise due to rounding during intermediate calculations.
