Question:

Citing specific investigations, discuss what the results of twin studieshave suggested about the role of heredity in the developmentof schizophrenia.

Options:

A: Identical twins have a lower concordance rate for schizophrenia than fraternal twins
B: Environmental factors are the sole determinants in the development of schizophrenia, with no genetic influence
C: The concordance rate for schizophrenia in fraternal twins is the same as in the general population
D: Schizophrenia is solely transmitted through genetic factors
E: The findings support the view that a predisposition for schizophrenia may exist and it is genetically transmitted
F: Schizophrenia is equally likely to develop in both twins, regardless of zygosity
G: Identical twins have a 100% concordance rate for schizophrenia
H: Identical twins raised apart have no higher concordance for schizophrenia than strangers
I: The concordance rate for schizophrenia in identical twins is the same as in non-twin siblings
J: Fraternal twins have a higher concordance rate for schizophrenia than identical twins

Okay, so I have this question about twin studies and schizophrenia. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. 

The question is asking what twin studies suggest about the role of heredity in schizophrenia. The options are A to J. I remember that twin studies often look at concordance ratesâ€”how often both twins have the same condition. In the case of schizophrenia, I think they compare identical twins (who share more genes) with fraternal twins (who share about half the genes).

So, from what I recall, identical twins have a higher concordance rate for schizophrenia than fraternal twins. But I'm not sure about the exact numbers. I think the rate is something like 40-50% for identical twins, and lower for fraternal, maybe around 10-15%. This suggests that genetics plays a role, but it's not 100%, so environment must also contribute.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Identical twins have a lower concordance rate than fraternal. That doesn't sound right because I thought identicals have higher rates. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B says environmental factors are the only cause. No, because the studies show some genetic influence, so B is wrong.

Option C: Fraternal concordance same as general population. I think the general population has about 1% prevalence, and fraternal twins are a bit higher than that, so C is incorrect.

Option D: Schizophrenia is solely transmitted genetically. No, because environment matters too, so D is wrong.

Option E: Findings support a genetic predisposition. That makes sense because higher concordance in identical twins suggests a genetic component. So E seems correct.

Option F: Both twins equally likely regardless of zygosity. No, identicals are more likely, so F is wrong.

Option G: 100% concordance. No, because even identical twins don't always both have it, so G is incorrect.

Option H: Identical twins raised apart have no higher rate than strangers. I think when twins are raised apart, the concordance rate is still higher than the population but lower than when they're raised together, so H is incorrect.

Option I: Identical twin concordance same as non-twin siblings. No, because identical twins have higher rates than non-twin siblings, so I is wrong.

Option J: Fraternal have higher concordance than identical. No, because identicals have higher rates, so J is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be E. The studies support a genetic predisposition that's transmitted.

The results of twin studies suggest that identical twins have a higher concordance rate for schizophrenia than fraternal twins, indicating a genetic predisposition. While genetics plays a significant role, environmental factors also contribute, as concordance rates are not 100%. Therefore, the findings support the view that a predisposition for schizophrenia may exist and is genetically transmitted.

Answer: E
