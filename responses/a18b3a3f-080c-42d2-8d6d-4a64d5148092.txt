Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about what Becker proclaimed regarding cannabis use. I'm a bit rusty on my sociology, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the question is asking about Becker's stance on cannabis. I remember that Becker was a sociologist, specifically known for his work in labeling theory. Labeling theory deals with how society labels people as deviants and how that affects their behavior.

Wait, wasn't there something about gateway drugs? Oh right, I think some people argue that using cannabis can lead to harder drugs, like cocaine or heroin. That's the gateway hypothesis. But I'm not sure if Becker actually supported that. Alternatively, he might have discussed how cannabis use is a form of rebellion, which makes sense because using an illicit substance can be seen as a way to defy societal norms.

Another angle: I remember that Becker wrote about deviance in his book "Outcastes of Tomorrow." He talked about how individuals become deviants through a process of being labeled. So, maybe he discussed how cannabis use is learned gradually through social processes, like a deviant career. That would tie into option G.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C says it's a gateway drug. I'm trying to recall if Becker specifically said that. Or was that more of a perspective from other sources, like the government's stance in the 70s and 80s? Maybe Becker focused more on the social aspects rather than the direct physical effects.

Alternatively, option J says it's a form of rebellion. That aligns with labeling theory because using cannabis could be a way to rebel against societal norms, which then leads to being labeled a deviant. So perhaps Becker saw it as a form of rebellion.

Wait, but the question is about what Becker proclaimed. I'm trying to remember specific points from his work. I think he might have discussed that deviance is a process, not just a label, and that people become deviants through interactions and labels. So, maybe he talked about how cannabis use is learned through these social processes, which would point to option G.

Alternatively, option J is about rebellion, which is a reason someone might start using cannabis, but I'm not sure if Becker specifically framed it that way. He might have been more focused on the process of becoming a deviant rather than the initial reason.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn between G and J. Let me think again. Becker's work on labeling theory suggests that individuals don't start off as deviants; they become them through the labeling process. So, maybe he talked about how cannabis use starts as something minor but becomes a bigger issue through societal reactions. That might align with option G, which says it's learned gradually through the social processes of a deviant career.

Alternatively, if he was discussing why people use cannabis, he might have said it's a way to rebel, which is option J. But I think the question is more about his analysis of the behavior itself, not the motivation.

Wait, I think I remember Becker discussing the concept of a "deviant career," where an individual's initial minor acts of deviance lead to more serious behavior as they are labeled and stigmatized. So, in the context of cannabis use, he might have said that it's learned gradually through these social processes, which would point to option G.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: I think the gateway drug idea is more associated with other sources, maybe the DEA or anti-drug campaigns, rather than Becker. So, option C might not be the right choice.

Putting it all together, I think the best fit is option G: learned gradually through the social processes of a deviant career.

The answer is G: learned gradually through the social processes of a deviant career.

G
