Okay, so I have this question about the Hohokam and which practice they borrowed from Mesoamerican culture. I'm a bit rusty on my ancient cultures, but let me try to think this through. 

First, I need to recall what I know about the Hohokam. I remember they were a pre-Columbian culture in what's now the Southwestern United States, specifically in Arizona. They were known for their irrigation systems and their society was quite complex. They also had some interesting architectural features, like the construction of canals and the use of adobe bricks.

Now, the question is about a practice they borrowed from Mesoamerica. Mesoamerica refers to the area from central Mexico down to parts of Central America, home to the Aztecs, Mayans, and other indigenous cultures. These cultures had various practices, including things like calendar systems, mummification, religious ceremonies, human sacrifice, and specific architectural styles.

Looking at the options:

A: Use of a calendar system based on celestial bodies. I know that Mesoamerican cultures had complex calendars, like the Mayan calendar. But did the Hohokam adopt this? I'm not sure. They did have some astronomical knowledge, but I'm not certain if they used a Mesoamerican-style calendar.

B: Practice of mummification for the dead. Mummification is more commonly associated with ancient Egypt, but I think some Andean cultures, like the Inca, also practiced mummification. I'm not sure about Mesoamerica. Maybe some cultures did, but I'm not certain if the Hohokam borrowed this specifically.

C: Ritual consumption of maize beer. Maize is a staple in Mesoamerican cultures, and they had various beverages, including a type of beer made from maize called pulque. The Hohokam did grow maize and had fermentation techniques, but did they get the ritual aspect from Mesoamerica? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. They might have had similar practices, but I'm not sure if it's a direct borrowing.

D: Construction of underground dwellings. The Hohokam are known for their pithouses, which are semi-underground structures. But I'm not sure if this practice was borrowed from Mesoamerica. I think Mesoamerican structures were more above ground, like pyramids and palaces. So maybe this isn't the right answer.

E: Ritual human sacrifice. Mesoamerican cultures, especially the Aztecs, were known for their human sacrifices as part of religious rituals. The Hohokam, as far as I remember, didn't practice human sacrifice. Their religious practices were more focused on ancestor worship and other spiritual practices, but not the same as Mesoamerican rituals. So probably not E.

F: Use of cacao in religious ceremonies. Cacao was indeed used in Mesoamerican cultures, like the Mayans and Aztecs, in their religious rituals and as a symbol of status. The Hohokam did trade with Mesoamerican cultures, and I believe cacao was traded northward. They might have used it in ceremonies, but I'm not certain if this is the specific practice they borrowed.

G: Playing ritual ball games. Mesoamerica had the famous ballgame, often associated with religious and political significance. The Hohokam also played a form of ballgame, possibly influenced by Mesoamerican versions. The ballcourt designs in the Southwest sometimes show similarities. So this might be a strong candidate.

H: Construction of stepped pyramids. Stepped pyramids are a hallmark of Mesoamerican architecture, as seen in places like Teotihuacan and the Mayan cities. The Hohokam did build structures, but their pyramids were more like platform mounds rather than the large stepped pyramids of Mesoamerica. So maybe not H.

Putting it together, the most likely options seem to be G (ritual ball games) and perhaps H (stepped pyramids). But I'm not sure about H because the Hohokam structures don't look exactly like Mesoamerican stepped pyramids. They were more for ceremonial purposes but not as elaborate.

Another angle: the Hohokam are part of the Ancestral Puebloan tradition, but they had some connections to Mesoamerica. They were known for their trade, especially with the Anasazi and others. The ballgame is a significant Mesoamerican ritual that could have been adopted.

Wait, but the question is about what they borrowed. If the Hohokam had their own version of a ballgame, was it influenced by Mesoamerican practices? I think so. The game in the Southwest, especially in the Hohokam region, shows influences from the Mesoamerican version, which was a significant ritual practice.

So, based on this, I'm leaning towards G: playing ritual ball games. Alternatively, maybe F (use of cacao) is also a possibility, but I think the ballgame is more directly a borrowed practice.

The Hohokam, an ancient culture in the Southwestern United States, borrowed the practice of playing ritual ball games from Mesoamerican cultures. This is evident from the similarities in ballcourt designs and the significance of the game in their ceremonial life. 

Answer: G
