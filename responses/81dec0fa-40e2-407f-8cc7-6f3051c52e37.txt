Question:

What characteristics of arthropods have been of primary importance in their evolutionary success?

Options:

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which characteristics of arthropods have been most important for their evolutionary success. The options are from A to J. Let me think through each one.

Arthropods are a huge group, including insects, spiders, crustaceans, and more. Their success must be due to some key features that allowed them to adapt to various environments and thrive.

Option A: Development of a chitinous exoskeleton, well-developed organ systems, and complex nervous tissues. Chitinous exoskeletons are definitely a big deal because they provide protection and support. Also, having good organ systems and a complex nervous system would support their survival and adaptability. That seems like a strong candidate.

Option B: Adoption of aquatic respiration across all species. Wait, no. Some arthropods are aquatic, like crabs, but many are terrestrial, like insects. So not all use aquatic respiration. Plus, respiration methods vary, so this can't be the primary factor across all species.

Option C: Development of many non-specialized appendages. Arthropods do have appendages like legs and antennae, but I'm not sure if they're non-specialized. Some appendages are highly specialized, like wings or mouthparts, so maybe C isn't the best choice.

Option D: Simple organ systems. Arthropods have more complex organ systems than simpler organisms. I think their success is tied to more advanced systems, so D might not be right.

Option E: Evolution of a single pair of wings for flight. While flight is a major success factor for many insects, not all arthropods can fly. Plus, some have two pairs of wings. So this is probably too specific to just be a primary factor.

Option F: Soft exoskeleton. No, arthropods typically have hard exoskeletons made of chitin. A soft one would be less protective, so F seems incorrect.

Option G: Limited nervous tissues. This doesn't make sense. Arthropods have well-developed nervous systems, especially insects with their brains and ganglia. So G is probably wrong.

Option H: Reduction in body segmentation. Actually, arthropods are known for their body segmentation. Reducing it might limit their adaptability. So H is likely not correct.

Option I: Single central eye. Most arthropods have compound eyes, especially insects, so a single eye isn't their main feature. Plus, vision varies a lot among species. So I doesn't seem right.

Option J: Porous exoskeleton for gas exchange. Some arthropods, like insects, have structures like spiracles for breathing, but I'm not sure if a porous exoskeleton is a primary factor. It might help, but maybe it's not the main reason for their success.

Putting it all together, the key factors seem to be the exoskeleton, organ systems, and nervous complexity. So A is the best option.

The characteristics that have been most important for arthropods' evolutionary success include a chitinous exoskeleton, which provides protection and support, along with well-developed organ systems and a complex nervous system that enhances their adaptability and survival. These features have allowed arthropods to diversify and thrive in various environments.

Answer: A
