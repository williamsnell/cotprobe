Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given argument is valid or not using indirect truth tables. The argument is:

Premises:
1. (T · ~U) ⊃ ~W
2. ~W ⊃ X
3. ~Z ⊃ W

Conclusion:
~(X · Z) / T ⊃ U

Wait, I'm not sure I parse that conclusion correctly. The way it's written, maybe it's ~(X · Z) ⊃ T, and then T ⊃ U? Or is it a single statement? Hmm, the way it's written, it's a bit confusing. Let me look again.

Wait, the conclusion is written as ~ (X · Z) / T ⊃ U. Maybe that's two separate conclusions? Or perhaps it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the conclusion is ~(X · Z) ⊃ (T ⊃ U). Or maybe it's ~(X · Z) and T, leading to U. Hmm, perhaps I should look at the structure again.

Wait, perhaps the argument is structured as:

1. (T · ~U) ⊃ ~W
2. ~W ⊃ X
3. ~Z ⊃ W
4. ~(X · Z) / T ⊃ U

Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the conclusion is ~(X · Z) ⊃ (T ⊃ U). Or maybe it's split into two parts: ~(X · Z) and T, leading to U. Alternatively, perhaps the conclusion is ~(X · Z) ⊃ (T ⊃ U). Hmm, maybe that's the intended structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the conclusion is ~(X · Z) ⊃ (T ⊃ U). Or maybe it's a single statement: ~ (X · Z) ⊃ (T ⊃ U). Or perhaps it's ~(X · Z) and T implies U. Alternatively, maybe the conclusion is ~(X · Z) ⊃ (T · U). Hmm, I'm a bit confused about how the conclusion is structured.

Wait, let me try to parse the conclusion again. The way it's written is: ~(X · Z) / T ⊃ U. So perhaps it's two separate implications? Or maybe it's ~(X · Z) divided by T implies U. That doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's ~(X · Z) and T, leading to U. So maybe the conclusion is (X · Z) ⊃ (T ⊃ U), but written differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the conclusion is ~(X · Z) ⊃ (T → U). That would make sense as a single implication. So perhaps the conclusion is: If not both X and Z are true, then T implies U.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the conclusion is two separate statements: ~(X · Z) and T ⊃ U. Hmm, but that would be two separate conclusions, which doesn't make sense in a standard argument structure.

Wait, perhaps the slash is indicating a division, so the conclusion is ~(X · Z) implies T, which in turn implies U. So the conclusion might be ~(X · Z) ⊃ (T ⊃ U). That seems plausible.

So, the argument would be:

1. (T · ~U) ⊃ ~W
2. ~W ⊃ X
3. ~Z ⊃ W
4. ~(X · Z) ⊃ (T ⊃ U)

Wait, but the way the conclusion is written in the question is as ~(X · Z) / T ⊃ U. So perhaps it's written as two parts: ~(X · Z) and T, leading to U. So maybe the conclusion is (X · Z) ⊃ U, but that's not matching the slash.

Alternatively, perhaps the conclusion is ~(X · Z) and T, which together imply U. So, if both ~(X · Z) and T are true, then U must be true. That would be a conjunction leading to U.

But perhaps I should try to proceed without getting too stuck on the conclusion's structure. Let me try to approach this step by step.

The goal is to determine if the argument is valid. If it's invalid, I need to find a counterexample where the premises are true, but the conclusion is false.

First, let me list the premises:

1. (T ∧ ~U) → ~W
2. ~W → X
3. ~Z → W

And the conclusion is: ~(X ∧ Z) → (T → U)

Wait, that seems more plausible. So the conclusion is: If not both X and Z are true, then if T is true, U must be true. So, the conclusion is: ~(X ∧ Z) → (T → U). Alternatively, in other words, if either X is false or Z is false (or both), then T implies U.

Alternatively, using logical equivalences, this can be written as: (X ∧ Z) ∨ (T → U). But perhaps it's easier to work with the original form.

So, the argument is:

Premises:
1. (T ∧ ~U) → ~W
2. ~W → X
3. ~Z → W

Conclusion:
~(X ∧ Z) → (T → U)

To check validity, I can construct an indirect truth table. If there's a row where all premises are true and the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid.

So, I need to find a truth assignment where premises 1, 2, 3 are true, and conclusion is false.

The conclusion is ~(X ∧ Z) → (T → U). The conclusion is false only when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. So, when ~(X ∧ Z) is true, and T → U is false.

T → U is false only when T is true and U is false.

So, for the conclusion to be false, we need:

1. ~(X ∧ Z) is true: So, X ∧ Z is false. Which means either X is false, or Z is false, or both.

2. T is true and U is false.

Additionally, the premises must all be true.

So, let's outline the conditions:

- ~(X ∧ Z) is true → X is false or Z is false (or both).
- T is true.
- U is false.

And premises 1, 2, 3 must be true.

Let me consider each premise under these conditions.

Premise 1: (T ∧ ~U) → ~W

Since T is true and U is false, T ∧ ~U is true. So, for this implication to be true, ~W must be true. So, W must be false.

Premise 2: ~W → X

We have W is false, so ~W is true. Therefore, X must be true for this implication to hold. Because if ~W is true and X is false, then ~W → X would be false, which we can't have because we're assuming all premises are true.

So, X must be true.

But wait, from earlier, we have ~(X ∧ Z). Since X is true, Z must be false. Because X ∧ Z would be true only if both are true. Since X is true, Z must be false to make X ∧ Z false.

So, Z is false.

Now, let's check premise 3: ~Z → W.

Since Z is false, ~Z is true. So, for premise 3 to be true, W must be true.

Wait, but earlier from premise 1, we concluded that W is false. So, this is a contradiction. Because premise 1 requires W to be false, but premise 3 requires W to be true.

So, under the conditions where:

- T is true
- U is false
- X is true (because premise 2 requires it)
- Z is false (because X is true, so to make ~(X ∧ Z) true)
- W must be false (from premise 1)
- W must be true (from premise 3)

This is a contradiction. Therefore, there is no row where all premises are true, and the conclusion is false. So, the argument is valid. Therefore, the answer would be A: Valid.

Wait, but let me double-check because maybe I made a mistake in the reasoning.

Wait, let's go through it again.

We need to find a situation where premises 1,2,3 are true, and conclusion is false.

Conclusion is false when:

- ~(X ∧ Z) is true → X is false or Z is false.
- T → U is false → T is true and U is false.

So, T=true, U=false.

From premise 1: (T ∧ ~U) → ~W. Since T is true and U is false, T ∧ ~U is true. So, ~W must be true → W is false.

Premise 2: ~W → X. Since W is false, ~W is true. So, X must be true.

From X being true and ~(X ∧ Z) being true (since conclusion's antecedent is true), Z must be false.

Premise 3: ~Z → W. Since Z is false, ~Z is true. So, W must be true.

But from premise 1, W is false. So, W can't be both true and false. Therefore, no such assignment exists where all premises are true and the conclusion is false. Therefore, the argument is valid.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is "Valid." So the answer should be A.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes these problems can have tricky setups. Let me make a truth table to be thorough.

Let me list all possible assignments, but since there are 5 variables (T, U, W, X, Z), it's a bit lengthy, but perhaps I can focus on the necessary variables.

We have T=true, U=false, X=true, Z=false, W=false.

Check each premise:

1. (T ∧ ~U) → ~W → (T ∧ true) → ~W → T → ~W → true → (since ~W is true because W is false). So premise 1 holds.

2. ~W → X → true → X is true → holds.

3. ~Z → W → true → W is false → implication is false because ~Z is true, W is false → true → false is false. So premise 3 is false.

Wait, but we need all premises to be true. So in this assignment, premise 3 is false. Therefore, this assignment doesn't satisfy all premises being true. So, it's not a counterexample.

Wait, so maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine.

Wait, in the scenario where T is true, U is false, X is true, Z is false, W is false.

Premise 1: (T ∧ ~U) → ~W → (T ∧ true) → ~W → T → ~W. Since W is false, ~W is true. So, T → true, which is true. So premise 1 holds.

Premise 2: ~W → X → true → X is true → holds.

Premise 3: ~Z → W → true → W is false → implication is false. So, in this case, premise 3 is false. So, this assignment doesn't make all premises true, so it's not a valid counterexample.

So, perhaps there's no such assignment where all premises are true and the conclusion is false. Therefore, the argument is valid, so the answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check other possibilities.

Wait, but maybe I missed a possible assignment. Let me think again.

We need:

- T = true
- U = false
- X = true (from premise 2)
- Z = false (because X is true, to make ~(X ∧ Z) true)
- W: From premise 1, W must be false. From premise 3, W must be true. Contradiction.

So, no possible assignment where T=true, U=false, X=true, Z=false, and W is both false and true. Therefore, no such row exists where all premises are true and conclusion is false. So, argument is valid.

Therefore, the answer is A.

The argument is valid because there is no counterexample where all premises are true and the conclusion is false.
