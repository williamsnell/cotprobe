Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a bicycle's gears and the speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my mechanics, but let's try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem says that the rider can choose the radius of the rear sprocket. The front sprocket has a radius of 12.0 cm. The angular speed of the front sprocket is 0.6 revolutions per second. We need to find the radius of the rear sprocket that makes the tangential speed of the rear wheel's rim 5 m/s. The rear wheel's radius is 0.330 meters.

Wait, tangential speed of the rear wheel's rim... So that's the speed at which the point on the edge of the rear tire is moving. I remember that tangential speed v is related to angular speed ω by v = r * ω, where r is the radius of the wheel. So for the rear wheel, v is 5 m/s, and its radius is 0.330 m. So maybe I can find the angular speed of the rear wheel first.

Let me calculate that. Rear wheel's angular speed ω_rear = v / r_rear. Wait, v is in m/s and r_rear is in meters, so let's convert units to be consistent. 0.330 meters is 33 cm, but maybe I can just work in meters.

So ω_rear = 5 m/s / 0.330 m = approximately 15.1515 rad/s. Wait, but wait, angular speed is usually in rad/s. Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the relationship between the front and rear sprockets.

Oh right, the chain connects the front and rear sprockets, so their linear speeds at the point of contact with the chain must be the same. So the speed of the chain is the same for both front and rear sprockets. So the tangential speed of the front sprocket's teeth is equal to the tangential speed of the rear sprocket's teeth.

But wait, tangential speed v = ω * r, where ω is the angular speed and r is the radius. The front sprocket's angular speed is given as 0.6 rev/s. I should convert that to rad/s because it's easier to work with SI units. So 1 rev is 2π radians, so 0.6 rev/s = 0.6 * 2π = 1.2π rad/s ≈ 3.7699 rad/s.

The front sprocket's radius is 12.0 cm, which is 0.12 meters. So the tangential speed of the front sprocket's edge (which is the same as the chain's speed) is v_front = ω_front * r_front = 3.7699 rad/s * 0.12 m ≈ 0.4524 m/s.

Wait, but the chain's speed is the same as the rear sprocket's speed, so v_rear_sprocket = v_front = 0.4524 m/s. Now, the rear sprocket's tangential speed is related to its own angular speed. But wait, the rear sprocket is fixed to the rear axle, so the angular speed of the rear sprocket must be the same as the rear wheel's angular speed. Because they're fixed together, right?

Wait, no. Wait, the rear sprocket is attached to the axle, which turns the wheel. So the rear sprocket's rotation is what turns the wheel. So the angular speed of the rear sprocket (ω_sprocket_rear) is related to the wheel's angular speed (ω_wheel) by the gear ratio. But wait, the tangential speed at the point where the chain connects to the rear sprocket is the same as the speed of the chain. So v_sprocket_rear = v_chain = 0.4524 m/s.

But the rear sprocket's tangential speed is also equal to ω_sprocket_rear * r_rear_sprocket. So 0.4524 m/s = ω_sprocket_rear * r_rear_sprocket. But also, the rear wheel's angular speed is ω_wheel, and the tangential speed of the wheel's rim is v_wheel = ω_wheel * r_wheel. We know v_wheel is 5 m/s, so ω_wheel = v_wheel / r_wheel = 5 m/s / 0.330 m ≈ 15.1515 rad/s.

But the rear sprocket's angular speed and the wheel's angular speed are the same because they're fixed together, right? So ω_sprocket_rear = ω_wheel ≈ 15.1515 rad/s.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if we use that, then 0.4524 = 15.1515 * r_rear_sprocket → r_rear_sprocket = 0.4524 / 15.1515 ≈ 0.02985 meters, which is about 2.985 cm. But looking at the options, that's not one of them. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I got it wrong. Let me think again. The rear sprocket's angular speed is the same as the wheel's angular speed because they are fixed together. So, the tangential speed of the rear sprocket's edge is ω_rear * r_rear_sprocket. But that must equal the chain's speed, which is same as the front sprocket's tangential speed.

So, v_chain = ω_front * r_front = 0.6 rev/s * 2π rad/rev * 0.12 m = 0.6 * 2π * 0.12 = 0.144π ≈ 0.4524 m/s.

Then, v_chain = ω_rear * r_rear_sprocket. But ω_rear is the same as ω_wheel because the sprocket and wheel rotate together. So ω_rear = v_wheel / r_wheel = 5 m/s / 0.330 m ≈ 15.1515 rad/s.

So, 0.4524 m/s = 15.1515 rad/s * r_rear_sprocket → r_rear_sprocket = 0.4524 / 15.1515 ≈ 0.02985 m = 2.985 cm. Looking at the options: D is 2.99 cm, so that's probably the answer. But wait, let me check again because sometimes I get confused between gear ratios.

Alternatively, maybe the chain's speed is the same, so the ratio of the front sprocket's teeth to the rear's teeth relates the angular speeds. But wait, the number of teeth would be proportional to the radius if the chain is the same pitch. So, the ratio of the radii is inverse to the ratio of angular speeds.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The speed of the chain (v_chain) is the same for both sprockets. So, v_chain = ω_front * r_front = ω_rear_sprocket * r_rear_sprocket.

But ω_rear_sprocket is the same as ω_wheel, which is 15.1515 rad/s. So plugging in, 0.4524 = 15.1515 * r_rear_sprocket → r_rear_sprocket ≈ 0.02985 m = 2.985 cm, which is approximately 2.99 cm. So option D is 2.99 cm.

To determine the radius of the rear sprocket that results in a tangential speed of 5 m/s at the rear wheel's rim, we analyze the relationships between the angular speeds and radii of the sprockets and wheel.

1. **Rear Wheel Angular Speed**:  
   The tangential speed of the rear wheel's rim is given as \( v_{\text{wheel}} = 5 \, \text{m/s} \), and its radius is \( r_{\text{wheel}} = 0.330 \, \text{m} \). The angular speed of the wheel is:  
   \[
   \omega_{\text{wheel}} = \frac{v_{\text{wheel}}}{r_{\text{wheel}}} = \frac{5}{0.330} \approx 15.1515 \, \text{rad/s}.
   \]

2. **Chain Speed**:  
   The chain's speed is the same as the tangential speed of the front sprocket. The front sprocket has a radius \( r_{\text{front}} = 0.12 \, \text{m} \) and an angular speed \( \omega_{\text{front}} = 0.6 \, \text{rev/s} = 0.6 \times 2\pi \approx 3.7699 \, \text{rad/s} \). Thus, the chain speed is:  
   \[
   v_{\text{chain}} = \omega_{\text{front}} \cdot r_{\text{front}} = 3.7699 \cdot 0.12 \approx 0.4524 \, \text{m/s}.
   \]

3. **Rear Sprocket Radius**:  
   The chain speed is also equal to the tangential speed of the rear sprocket, \( v_{\text{chain}} = \omega_{\text{rear}} \cdot r_{\text{rear}} \). Since the rear sprocket and wheel rotate together, \( \omega_{\text{rear}} = \omega_{\text{wheel}} \approx 15.1515 \, \text{rad/s} \). Solving for \( r_{\text{rear}} \):  
   \[
   r_{\text{rear}} = \frac{v_{\text{chain}}}{\omega_{\text{rear}}} = \frac{0.4524}{15.1515} \approx 0.02985 \, \text{m} = 2.985 \, \text{cm}.
   \]

4. **Final Answer**:  
   The closest option to \( 2.985 \, \text{cm} \) is **2.99 cm**, corresponding to option D.
