Question:

A dentist holds a concave mirror with radius of curvature 4 cm at a distance of 1.5 cm from a filling in a tooth. What is the magnification of the image of the filling?

Options:

A: 4 times the size of the object
B: 8 times the size of the object
C: 10 times the size of the object
D: 6 times the size of the object
E: 5 times the size of the object
F: 7 times the size of the object
G: 3 times the size of the object
H: 1.5 times the size of the object
I: 0.5 times the size of the object (image is smaller than the object)
J: 2 times the size of the object

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a dentist using a concave mirror. Hmm, concave mirrors are used in things like makeup mirrors to make objects look bigger, right? So the question is about magnification. I remember that the magnification formula for mirrors is m = - (image distance) / (object distance). But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact signs and what each part represents. 

The problem states that the dentist holds a concave mirror with a radius of curvature of 4 cm. So the focal length (f) is half of that, which makes f = 2 cm. Oh, right, because for mirrors, the focal length is R/2. So f is 2 cm.

The dentist is holding the mirror at a distance of 1.5 cm from the filling in the tooth. So the object distance (let's call it do) is 1.5 cm. Wait, but in mirror formulas, the object distance is usually the distance from the mirror to the object. So that's correct here.

Now, I need to find the magnification. The formula is m = - di/do, where di is the image distance. But wait, I don't know di yet. So maybe I should use the mirror equation first to find di. The mirror equation is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di. 

Let's plug in the values. f is 2 cm, do is 1.5 cm. So 1/2 = 1/1.5 + 1/di. Let me compute 1/1.5. 1.5 is 3/2, so 1/(3/2) is 2/3. So 1/2 = 2/3 + 1/di. Wait, that can't be right because 2/3 is greater than 1/2, so 1/di would be negative. Which makes sense because if the object is inside the focal length, the image is virtual and behind the mirror, so di would be negative.

So let's solve for 1/di. 1/di = 1/2 - 2/3. Wait, wait, no, the mirror equation is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di, so 1/di = 1/f - 1/do. So 1/di = (1/2) - (1/1.5). Let me calculate that. 1/2 is 0.5, and 1/1.5 is approximately 0.6667. So 0.5 minus 0.6667 is -0.1667. So 1/di is -0.1667, which means di is approximately -6 cm. Wait, because 1/di is negative, di is negative. So di is -6 cm. 

Now, magnification m is -di/do. So m = - (-6 cm) / (1.5 cm) = 6 / 1.5 = 4. So the magnification is 4 times. But wait, magnification is also positive because it's upright, I think. Wait, no, wait: concave mirrors when the object is within the focal length produce a virtual, upright, and magnified image. So the magnification should be positive, but in the formula, m is negative, which indicates the image is virtual and upright. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. 

Wait, the formula gives m = - di/do. So if di is negative (as in this case), then m becomes positive. Because, say, di is -6 cm, so m = - (-6) / 1.5 = 4. So the magnification is +4, which means upright and magnified. So the image is four times larger than the object. So the answer would be option A: 4 times.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I mix up the signs. So f is 2 cm, do is 1.5 cm. 1/f is 1/2 = 0.5. 1/do is 1/1.5 â‰ˆ 0.6667. So 0.5 = 0.6667 + 1/di. So 1/di = 0.5 - 0.6667 = -0.1667. So di is -6 cm. So m = - di/do = - (-6)/1.5 = 4. So yes, 4 times. So the magnification is 4 times, so option A.

The dentist uses a concave mirror with a radius of curvature of 4 cm, giving a focal length \( f = 2 \, \text{cm} \). The object distance \( d_o \) is 1.5 cm. Using the mirror equation \( \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i} \), we calculate \( d_i \):

\[
\frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{f} - \frac{1}{d_o} = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{1.5} = 0.5 - 0.6667 = -0.1667 \, \Rightarrow \, d_i = -6 \, \text{cm}.
\]

The magnification \( m \) is given by \( m = -\frac{d_i}{d_o} \):

\[
m = -\frac{-6}{1.5} = 4.
\]

Since the magnification is positive, the image is upright and magnified by 4 times. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: 4 times the size of the object**
