Question:

A resident lived in a house across the street from a small office building. One of the offices in that building was that of a criminal defense lawyer. The resident hated the idea of the lawyer's office being close to her home. She felt that it meant dangerous criminals were coming and going in her neighborhood. The resident spent a lot of time looking out her window, trying to figure out which people going in and out of the office building were criminals, and imagining what sorts of crimes they had committed. The resident eventually decided that she needed to drive the lawyer out of the neighborhood. She made a telephone call to the lawyer and said, "You are scum, and so are all of your clients. I know that you're conspiring to commit crimes with all those bad people you represent. The police should arrest you and put you in jail with your clients. " The lawyer was very upset by what he heard. If the lawyer asserts a claim for defamation against the resident based on the telephone call, he will most likely

Okay, so I've got this defamation question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me break it down step by step.

So the scenario is about a resident who calls a criminal defense lawyer and makes some pretty harsh statements. The lawyer is upset and wants to sue for defamation. The question is whether he'll succeed, and why.

First, I remember that defamation involves making a false statement of fact that harms someone's reputation. There are two types: libel, which is written, and slander, which is spoken. Here, it's a telephone call, so it's slander.

Now, the resident calls the lawyer and says, "You are scum, and so are all of your clients. I know that you're conspiring to commit crimes with all those bad people you represent. The police should arrest you and put you in jail with your clients." These are strong words. Let me pick out the key parts: calling the lawyer scum, saying he conspires to commit crimes, and that the police should arrest him. 

I think the first thing to consider is whether these statements are statements of fact or opinion. If they're opinions, then it's not defamation. But if they're factual assertions that are false, then it could be defamation.

The resident says the lawyer is conspiring to commit crimes. That sounds like a factual claimâ€”she's accusing him of criminal activity. So that's a statement of fact. If that's false, then it's defamatory. Also, calling someone scum could be seen as a factual assertion about their character, but sometimes it's considered opinion. Hmm, that's a bit tricky.

But wait, in defamation law, certain types of slander are actionable per se, meaning the plaintiff doesn't have to prove actual damages. These include statements accusing someone of a crime of moral turpitude, having a loathsome disease, adultery, or being unfit in their profession.

Here, the resident is accusing the lawyer of conspiring to commit crimes. That's a serious charge, potentially a crime of moral turpitude. So if the lawyer is a criminal defense lawyer, being accused of conspiring to commit crimes would harm his professional reputation. That might fall under slander per se, making it easier to prove.

Looking at the options, option F says "succeed, because the resident's remarks constituted slander per Se." That seems to fit because the statement is a serious accusation that's defamatory on its face.

Option A says the remarks were offensive and damaging. While that's true, it's more general. Option D says the remarks falsely accused the lawyer of committing a crime, which is correct, but the key here is that it's slander per se, which makes it actionable without needing to prove damages.

Wait, but option D is also correct in a way because she's falsely accusing him of crimes. But the question is about the claim succeeding, so the reason matters. Slander per se is a stronger basis because it's a category of statements that are obviously defamatory.

Other options: C says it's opinion, but I think the conspiracy part is a factual claim. E says not because it wasn't published widely, but slander doesn't require publication to many people; it just needs to be heard by someone who can be harmed. G says it's a personal conversation, but that's irrelevant; slander can occur in private. H is about emotional distress, but defamation is about harm to reputation, not just emotions. I says not because it wasn't published, but again, slander doesn't need a broad audience. J says it's her right to express feelings, but this goes beyond free speech because she's making false factual accusations.

So the best answer is F: the remarks constitute slander per se because they falsely accuse him of a crime, which is a category that's actionable without proof of damages.

The resident's remarks include serious accusations, such as conspiring to commit crimes, which are factual statements and fall under slander per se. This makes the claim actionable without needing to prove damages.
