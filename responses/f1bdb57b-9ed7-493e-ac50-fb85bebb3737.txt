Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electrostatic force between two tiny spheres. The question is asking about the value of alpha (α) that maximizes the magnitude of the electrostatic force F between them. Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the electrostatic force between two point charges is given by Coulomb's Law. The formula is F = k * |Q1 * Q2| / r², where k is Coulomb's constant, Q1 and Q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them. Since the spheres are treated as particles, I guess we can assume they're point charges, so the distance r remains constant in this scenario.

The problem says that a fraction α of the charge Q on the first sphere is transferred to the second sphere. So initially, the first sphere has charge Q, and the second has 0 charge. After transferring α*Q, the first sphere's charge becomes Q - αQ = Q(1 - α), and the second sphere's charge becomes αQ. Wait, no, wait—did I get that right? Wait, no. Wait, if a fraction α is transferred, then the charge on the first sphere becomes Q - (αQ), and the second gets αQ. But wait, wait a minute, maybe not. Because if the second sphere was initially neutral, then yes. But sometimes, in these problems, both might have charges, but in this case, the problem states that the second sphere is a nearby sphere, but it doesn't specify. Hmm, but the question says a fraction α is transferred from the first sphere to the second. So the first sphere's charge after transfer is Q(1 - α), and the second's charge is αQ. So the two charges are now Q1 = Q(1 - α) and Q2 = αQ.

Wait, but wait—actually, the problem says "a fraction α is to be transferred to a second, nearby sphere." That suggests that the second sphere might have been neutral before, so it's getting α*Q. So the two charges are Q(1-α) and αQ.

So the force between them would be F = k * [Q(1-α) * αQ] / r². Simplifying that, F = k * Q² α (1 - α) / r².

Wait, so F is proportional to α(1 - α), because the other terms are constants. So to maximize F, we need to maximize the product α(1 - α).

Hmm, I remember that the product α(1 - α) is a quadratic equation, and it reaches its maximum at α=0.5. Because the quadratic function f(α) = α(1 - α) = α - α². Taking the derivative f'(α) = 1 - 2α. Setting this to zero gives α = 1/2. So the maximum occurs at α=0.5.

Wait, but that's when the product is maximized, which would make F maximum. So the value of α that maximizes F is 0.5, which is option E.

But wait, let me think again. Because sometimes, the problem could involve the spheres being identical and whether the charge can be transferred in a way that creates maximum repulsion or something else. But no, in this case, the force is just the product of the two charges, so F is proportional to Q1 * Q2, which is Q(1 - α) * α Q, so the product is alpha times (1 - alpha), as I said. So the maximum is at alpha = 0.5.

But wait another thing—could it be that the maximum occurs at a different value? Because if one charge is positive and the other is negative, that might change things. But no, the problem just says the charge is transferred, so both would have the same sign if they were initially the same, but perhaps the second sphere was neutral. Wait, no, the problem just says a charge Q on the first sphere is being transferred. So if the first sphere was positively charged, then after transferring a fraction α, the first has (1-α)Q, and the second has αQ. So the force would be repulsive if both are positive. But the magnitude is what's being considered, so the sign doesn't matter for the magnitude; only the product matters.

Wait, but another thought: if you transfer a charge from one sphere to another, the second sphere's charge is alpha times Q. So when alpha is 0.5, each has 0.5Q, so the product is (0.5Q)(0.5Q)=0.25 Q². If alpha is 0.25, then the charges are 0.75 Q and 0.25 Q, their product is 0.1875 Q². Similarly, if alpha is 0.75, then the charges are 0.25 Q and 0.75 Q, product is 0.1875 Q². For alpha=0.6, the product is 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24 Q². For alpha=0.8, product is 0.8 * 0.2=0.16 Q². For alpha=0.9, it's 0.9 * 0.1=0.09 Q². So the maximum product is indeed at alpha=0.5, where it's 0.25 Q², which is the highest among the options given.

So the correct answer should be E, 0.5.

The electrostatic force between two charges is given by Coulomb's Law: \( F = k \frac{|Q_1 Q_2|}{r^2} \). Here, a fraction \( \alpha \) of the charge \( Q \) is transferred from the first sphere to the second. After the transfer, the charges on the spheres are \( Q_1 = Q(1 - \alpha) \) and \( Q_2 = \alpha Q \). The force becomes \( F \propto \alpha (1 - \alpha) \), a quadratic function that reaches its maximum at \( \alpha = 0.5 \). Testing other values confirms that \( \alpha = 0.5 \) yields the highest product \( \alpha(1 - \alpha) \), maximizing \( F \).
