Okay, so I have this related rates problem about a ladder leaning against a building. Let me try to visualize it. There's a 26-foot ladder, and the foot of the ladder is moving away from the building at 3 feet per second. I need to find how fast the top of the ladder is moving down when the foot is 10 feet away from the building. The answer will be the rate r, which I need to determine from the options given.

Hmm, I remember that related rates problems often involve using the Pythagorean theorem because we're dealing with a right triangle here—the ladder, the building, and the ground. So, let me set up some variables.

Let's denote x as the distance from the foot of the ladder to the building at any time t. Then, y would be the height of the top of the ladder on the building at that same time. The ladder's length is constant, so it's the hypotenuse, which is 26 feet. So, according to the Pythagorean theorem, we have:

x² + y² = 26²
x² + y² = 676

Now, I need to find the rate at which the top is moving down, which is dy/dt. I'm given that dx/dt is 3 ft/s because the foot is moving away. The problem asks for dy/dt when x is 10 feet.

So, I should differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time t to relate the rates. Let me do that:

d/dt (x² + y²) = d/dt (676)

The derivative of 676 is zero because it's a constant. So, applying the chain rule:

2x dx/dt + 2y dy/dt = 0

Now, I can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 2:

x dx/dt + y dy/dt = 0

I need to solve for dy/dt, so I'll rearrange the terms:

y dy/dt = -x dx/dt

Therefore:

dy/dt = (-x dx/dt) / y

I know dx/dt is 3 ft/s, but I don't know y when x is 10 ft. So, I need to find y at that moment. Let's plug x = 10 into the Pythagorean equation to find y.

10² + y² = 676
100 + y² = 676
y² = 676 - 100
y² = 576
y = sqrt(576) = 24 feet

So, y is 24 ft when x is 10 ft. Now, plug the known values into the equation for dy/dt:

dy/dt = (-10 * 3) / 24
dy/dt = (-30) / 24
Simplify that: divide numerator and denominator by 6.

-30 ÷ 6 = -5
24 ÷ 6 = 4

So, dy/dt = -5/4 ft/s. The negative sign indicates that the height is decreasing, which makes sense because the top is moving down. So, the rate r is 5/4 ft/s.

Wait, but let me check the options. The options are A through J, and option C is 5/4. So, I think the answer is C. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Let me go through the steps again. The setup is correct: x² + y² = 26². Differentiated to 2x dx/dt + 2y dy/dt = 0. Divided by 2, so x dx/dt + y dy/dt = 0. Solved for dy/dt: (-x dx/dt)/y.

Plugged x =10, dx/dt=3. Then y=24. So, dy/dt = (-10*3)/24 = -30/24 = -5/4. So, yes, that's correct. So, r is 5/4, which is option C.

The problem involves a 26-foot ladder leaning against a building, with the foot moving away at 3 ft/s. Using the Pythagorean theorem and differentiating, we find the top's downward rate when the foot is 10 feet away. Calculations show the rate is 5/4 ft/s.

Answer: C
