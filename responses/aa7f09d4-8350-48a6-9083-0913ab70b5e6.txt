Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for three random variables X, Y, and Z. The joint density function is given as f(x, y, z) = e^{-(x + y + z)} for x, y, z > 0. I need to find the CDF F(x, y, z), which is the probability that X ≤ x, Y ≤ y, and Z ≤ z. 

First, I remember that the CDF is the integral of the joint density function over the region where all variables are less than or equal to the given values. So, F(x, y, z) = P(X ≤ x, Y ≤ y, Z ≤ z) = ∫∫∫_{-infty}^{x} ∫_{-infty}^{y} ∫_{-infty}^{z} f(a, b, c) da db dc. But since the support is only for positive values, I can adjust the limits accordingly.

The joint density function here is f(x, y, z) = e^{-(x + y + z)}. Wait, that looks familiar. It's similar to the density function of a sum of independent exponential variables, but since they're all multiplied by negative, maybe each variable is exponential with rate 1. Because the exponential density is f(x) = λ e^{-λx}, and here λ is 1. So each of X, Y, Z is an exponential(1) random variable, and they might be independent because the joint density factors into the product of each variable's density.

If they are independent, then the joint density would be the product of the individual densities. Let me check: if X, Y, Z are independent, then f(x,y,z) = f_X(x) f_Y(y) f_Z(z). Each f_X(x) is e^{-x}, same for Y and Z. So yes, the joint density factors into e^{-x} * e^{-y} * e^{-z} = e^{-(x+y+z)}, which matches the given f(x,y,z). So X, Y, Z are independent.

Now, the CDF for each exponential(1) variable is F_X(x) = 1 - e^{-x}. Similarly for Y and Z. Since they are independent, the joint CDF F(x,y,z) is the product of the individual CDFs. So F(x,y,z) = F_X(x) * F_Y(y) * F_Z(z) = (1 - e^{-x})(1 - e^{-y})(1 - e^{-z}).

Looking at the options, option F is exactly that: (1 - e^-x)(1 - e^-y)(1 - e^-z). So I think the correct answer is option F.

The joint density function factors into the product of individual exponential densities, indicating independence. The CDF for each variable is 1 - e^{-x}, so the joint CDF is the product of these, leading to option F.

Answer: F
