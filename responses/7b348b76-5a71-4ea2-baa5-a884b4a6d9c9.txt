Okay, so I need to figure out what the turnover tax was in the Soviet economy. I'm a bit rusty on Soviet economic systems, but I remember they had a command economy with central planning. Let me think about what turnover tax means in general. 

Turnover tax usually refers to a tax based on the volume of sales, right? It's like a sales tax that businesses pay based on how much they sell. In capitalist economies, this is a common way for governments to collect revenue. But the Soviet Union had a very different economic structure.

In the Soviet system, the government controlled the economy through central planning. They set production quotas and prices. So, how would a turnover tax fit into that? Well, the state probably wanted a way to control and monitor the flow of goods. If they taxed based on turnover, they could influence the distribution of goods and possibly control inflation or manage resources.

Looking at the options:

A: Increase demand? I don't think so. Tax would likely decrease demand unless it's a rebate or something, which doesn't seem right.

B: Levy on assets to encourage investment. That sounds more like property taxes or capital gains, not turnover.

C: Set by the central planning board. That makes sense because everything was centrally planned. So the tax rate would be determined by the planners.

D: Subsidy for exports. No, a turnover tax is a tax, not a subsidy.

E: Direct government rationing. Rationing was done through coupons and such, not a tax.

F: Sales tax on total goods sold. This sounds close to what turnover tax is. So businesses would pay based on their sales.

G: Tariff on imports. That's a border tax, not turnover.

H: Adjust money costs so demand matches supply. Hmm, this seems more about economic management. Maybe the tax was used to control prices and ensure that supply meets demand.

I: Fee for operating in industries. That's more like a license fee, not turnover tax.

J: Fixed percentage of income for social services. That's an income tax, not turnover.

Wait, so the Soviet economy aimed for central planning. The turnover tax was likely a tool to control the flow of goods. Option F says it's a sales tax on goods sold, which is accurate in general. But option H talks about adjusting money costs to match supply and demand. In a planned economy, they might use taxes to balance supply and demand, so H could be correct.

But I'm a bit confused. The turnover tax in the Soviet context might have served a specific planning function. Maybe it was used to adjust prices to ensure that the quantity demanded matched supply. So H is about adjusting money costs, which ties into the central planning's role in setting prices and ensuring that goods were distributed as planned.

Alternatively, if it's just a tax on sales, F would make sense. But given the economic system, H seems more likely as the role. The question is about the role the turnover tax played, so it's probably about how it was used in the planning process.

So between F and H. F is more about what turnover tax is, while H is about its role in the economy.

Wait, the question is about the role, not the definition. So if it's used to adjust money costs so that supply meets demand, that's the role. So the answer would be H.
