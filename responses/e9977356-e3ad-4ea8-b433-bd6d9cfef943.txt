Okay, I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about fields and rings. Let me start by recalling what I know about these algebraic structures.

So, the question has two statements:

Statement 1: Every field is also a ring.
Statement 2: Every ring has a multiplicative identity.

I need to evaluate the truth of each statement and then choose the correct option from A to J.

First, let's tackle Statement 1. I remember that a field is a set equipped with two operations, addition and multiplication, where both operations make the set an abelian group under addition, and the non-zero elements form an abelian group under multiplication. That means every field satisfies all the ring axioms except for one thing: rings don't necessarily require that every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. Wait, no, actually, in a field, every non-zero element does have an inverse, so that's more than what a ring requires. 

Wait, but rings require that multiplication is associative and has distributive properties over addition. They don't need to have multiplicative inverses for all elements. So a field does satisfy all the ring properties because addition is commutative, there's an additive identity, additive inverses, and multiplication is associative and distributes over addition. The only extra thing a field has is that every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. So yes, every field is a ring because it meets all the ring criteria and has more properties. So Statement 1 is True.

Now, Statement 2: Every ring has a multiplicative identity. Hmm. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I remember that rings can be either with or without unity. A ring with unity (or a unital ring) has a multiplicative identity element. But not all rings have this. For example, the set of even integers under addition and multiplication forms a ring, but it doesn't have a multiplicative identity because there's no element that, when multiplied by any other even integer, gives that integer itself. Because 2 is the smallest, and 2 * x = x would require x=0.5, which isn't in the set. So in this case, the ring of even integers doesn't have a multiplicative identity. Therefore, Statement 2 is False.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. The definition of a ring sometimes varies. Some authors require rings to have a multiplicative identity, but others don't. Oh, right! So if the definition of a ring includes a multiplicative identity, then Statement 2 would be True. But if the definition doesn't require it, then rings can lack unity, making Statement 2 False. 

But I think in standard mathematics, especially in more advanced contexts, rings don't necessarily have a multiplicative identity. So, rings can be without unity. Therefore, the statement that every ring has a multiplicative identity is False.

So putting it together:

Statement 1: True
Statement 2: False

Looking at the options, that would correspond to option A: True, False.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Options:

A: True, False
B: True, True
C: Statement 2 is true but statement 1 cannot be determined
D: Statement 2 is false and statement 1 cannot be determined
E: False, False
F: Statement 1 is true but statement 2 cannot be determined
G: Statement 1 is false and statement 2 cannot be determined
H: Statement 1 is true and the truth of statement 2 depends on the specific ring
I: Statement 2 is true and the truth of statement 1 depends on the specific field
J: False, True

So, since Statement 1 is definitely true (every field has all ring properties), and Statement 2 is false (not every ring has a multiplicative identity), the correct answer should be A: True, False.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: In some contexts, especially introductory, rings are assumed to have a multiplicative identity. So if that's the case, then Statement 2 would be True. But I think in more general terms, rings don't need to have unity. So the answer depends on the definition used.

Wait, but the question is about whether every ring has a multiplicative identity. Since not all rings do, Statement 2 is False. So yeah, the answer is A.

The question evaluates two statements about algebraic structures. 

**Statement 1** asserts that every field is also a ring. A field satisfies all ring axioms, including commutative addition, additive inverses, and distributive multiplication, plus the additional property that every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. Since rings do not require multiplicative inverses for all elements, every field is indeed a ring. Thus, Statement 1 is True.

**Statement 2** claims that every ring has a multiplicative identity. Rings are not universally required to have a multiplicative identity (unity). For example, the ring of even integers lacks a multiplicative identity. Therefore, Statement 2 is False.

Given these evaluations, the correct answer is:

A: True, False

Answer: A
