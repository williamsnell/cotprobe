Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"We found that not only was it a civil war, an effort by a people who had for years been seeking their liberation from any colonial influence whatsoever, but also we found that the Vietnamese whom we had enthusiastically molded after our own image were hard put to take up the fight against the threat we were supposedly saving them from.
"We found most people didn't even know the difference between communism and democracy. They only wanted to work in rice paddies without helicopters strafing them and bombs with napalm burning their villages and tearing their country apart. They wanted everything to do with the war, particularly with this foreign presence of the United States of America, to leave them alone in peace, and they practiced the art of survival by siding with whichever military force was present at a particular time, be it Viet Cong, North Vietnamese or American."
John Kerry, 1971

Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about the Counterculture Movement of the 1960s. The question is asking which two political issues most concerned them. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Counterculture Movement.

From what I remember, the 1960s Counterculture Movement was a social and political movement that opposed several aspects of the mainstream American culture and politics of the time. They were known for their advocacy of civil rights, environmentalism, and opposition to the Vietnam War. Also, issues like women's rights and anti-war protests were significant.

Looking at the options, they all pair two issues. Hmm. The question mentions "the two political issues that most concerned" the movement. I should focus on the main ones.

I know that the Vietnam War was a major focus. The Counterculture Movement was very against the U.S. involvement in Vietnam. Protests, draft dodging, and opposition to the war were central activities. So one of the issues is definitely the Vietnam War.

The other issue is a bit trickier. The Counterculture Movement also focused on civil rights. They supported the civil rights movement, as many of their members were involved in fighting against racial discrimination and for equality. So civil rights would be another major concern.

Looking at the options, option H is "U.S. involvement in Vietnam and the civil rights movement." That seems to fit. Let me check the other options to be sure.

Option A mentions civil rights and environmentalism. While environmentalism was part of their concerns, it was more of a later focus, perhaps not the top two. Option F includes Vietnam and women's rights. Women's rights were important, but again, maybe not the top two. Option G pairs Vietnam and environmentalism, which might not be the primary two.

Option E is Vietnam and flag burning. Flag burning was a symbolic act of protest, but I'm not sure if it was one of their main concerns. Option I is the draft and environmentalism. The draft was related to the Vietnam War, so maybe it's part of that issue. The draft itself was a significant issue, but the broader issue was the war itself.

Option J is censorship and the draft. Censorship was a concern, but again, not sure if it's the top two. Option D is flag burning and the draft, which seems more about specific acts rather than the main issues.

So, the two most central issues were the U.S. involvement in Vietnam and the civil rights movement. So the correct answer should be H.

The Counterculture Movement of the 1960s focused on several key issues, but the two most central were opposition to the U.S. involvement in Vietnam and support for the civil rights movement. These issues were central to their political concerns and activism during that period.

Answer: H
