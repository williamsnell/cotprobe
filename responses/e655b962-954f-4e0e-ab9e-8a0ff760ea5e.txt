Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the number of coils in a helical spring. The goal is to make sure the deflection doesn't exceed 1.5 inches under a certain load. Hmm, I remember that springs have something to do with Hooke's Law, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to break this down.

First, the problem gives me some parameters: mean diameter of the spring is 2.25 inches, wire diameter is 0.15 inches, allowable shear stress is 50,000 psi, and shear modulus of elasticity is 12 × 10^6 psi. Oh wait, shear modulus, that's G, right? So G is 12e6 psi.

I think the formula for the deflection of a helical spring involves the shear modulus, the number of coils, and the diameters. Let me recall. I think the formula is something like deflection (δ) equals (8 * G * load * n^2) divided by (π^2 * D^4 * d), where D is the mean diameter and d is the wire diameter. Wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, I remember that the spring constant k is related to these parameters.

Wait, the spring constant k for a helical spring is given by k = (G * d^4) / (8 * n * D^4), but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's k = (G * d^4) / (8 * n * D^4 * something). Hmm, perhaps I should double-check the formula.

Alternatively, I think the formula for deflection δ is (F * n^2) / (G * D^4) ) multiplied by some constants. Wait, perhaps it's better to approach this step by step.

Let me think: The shear stress in a spring under torsion is given by τ = (16 * F * n) / (π * d * D), where F is the load, n is the number of coils, d is the wire diameter, and D is the mean diameter. But the allowable shear stress τ is given as 50,000 psi. So maybe I can first express F in terms of τ, n, d, and D.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give the load F directly. Instead, it gives the maximum allowable deflection δ. So perhaps I need to relate F and δ together.

I remember that the deflection δ of a helical spring is given by δ = (F * n^2) / (G * D^4) ) * some constant. Let me see, maybe the formula is δ = (F * n^2) / (G * D^4) ) * (some factor involving π).

Wait, more accurately, the deflection formula I think is δ = (8 * F * n^2) / (π^2 * G * D^4) ) * (d^4), but I'm getting confused. Maybe another approach.

Wait, perhaps first find the spring constant k using the formula k = (G * d^4) / (8 * n * D^4). Then, using Hooke's Law, F = k * δ. So substituting k into F gives F = (G * d^4 * δ) / (8 * n * D^4). But then, how does shear stress come into play?

Wait, shear stress τ is related to the torsion in the spring. The shear stress in a torsion spring is τ = (T * d) / (2 * r^3), where T is the torque. But wait, for a helical spring, the torque T is equal to the load F multiplied by the mean radius r. Since the mean diameter D is 2.25 inches, the mean radius r is D/2, which is 1.125 inches.

So T = F * r. Then, substituting into τ: τ = (F * r * d) / (2 * r^3) ) = (F * d) / (2 * r^2).

But wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, I've heard that the shear stress in a helical spring can be given by τ = (16 * F * n) / (π * d * D). Let me check the units and see if that makes sense.

Alternatively, another formula I found is τ = (16 * F * n) / (π * d * D). Let's see: F is in pounds, n is unitless, d and D are in inches, so τ would be in psi. So the units would work out if F is in pounds, but I'm not sure if this formula is correct.

Wait, maybe it's better to use the torsional formula. The shear stress at the surface of the spring wire (radius a = d/2) under torsion is given by τ = (T * a) / (J), where J is the polar moment of inertia. For a circular shaft, J = (π * a^4) / 32. So τ = (T * a) / (π * a^4 / 32) ) = (32 * T) / (π * a^3).

But T is the torque on the spring, which for a helical spring is T = F * r, where r is the mean radius. So substituting T, we get τ = (32 * F * r) / (π * a^3).

Since a is the radius of the wire, a = d/2. So a = 0.15/2 = 0.075 inches.

So τ = (32 * F * r) / (π * (0.075)^3). Let me compute that denominator first. (0.075)^3 is 0.075 * 0.075 * 0.075 = 0.000421875. Multiply by π: 0.000421875 * π ≈ 0.001323.

So τ ≈ (32 * F * r) / 0.001323.

But the allowable τ is 50,000 psi. So,

50,000 = (32 * F * r) / 0.001323.

We can solve for F:

F = (50,000 * 0.001323) / (32 * r).

But r is D/2, where D is 2.25 inches, so r=1.125 inches.

So F = (50,000 * 0.001323) / (32 * 1.125).

Let me compute numerator: 50,000 * 0.001323 = 50,000 * 0.001323 = 66.15.

Denominator: 32 * 1.125 = 36.

So F = 66.15 / 36 ≈ 1.8375 pounds.

Wait, that seems low. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the formula again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this using the deflection formula and the shear stress formula together.

I think another approach is to relate the number of coils n with the deflection and the shear stress.

I recall that the deflection δ of a helical spring is given by:

δ = (F * n^2) / (G * D^4) * (d^4 / 8) ? Wait, no, perhaps the formula is δ = (8 * F * n^2) / (π^2 * G * D^4) ) * (d^4) ? I'm getting a bit confused. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for deflection is δ = (F * n^2) * (d^4) / (8 * G * D^4). Let me think about the units. F is in pounds, n is unitless, d and D are in inches, G is in psi.

So F * n^2 * d^4 / (8 * G * D^4) would have units of (lb * in^4) / (lb/in^2 * in^4) ) = (lb * in^4) / (lb/in² * in^4) ) = (lb * in^4) / (lb * in^2) ) = in²? No, that can't be right. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula is δ = (F * n^2 * d^4) / (8 * G * D^4). Let me check the units again. F is in pounds, n^2 is unitless, d^4 is in^4, G is psi (lb/in²), D^4 is in^4. So putting it together:

δ has units of (lb * in^4) / (lb/in² * in^4) ) = (lb * in^4 * in²) / (lb * in^4) ) = in²? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh, I must be making a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is δ = (8 * F * n^2) / (π^2 * G * D^4) * (d^4). Wait, let me check the units again.

Wait, maybe I should look for the formula for deflection in a helical spring. I think it's δ = (F * n^2 * d^4) / (8 * G * D^4). Let me see.

Wait, another approach: The spring constant k is given by k = (G * d^4) / (8 * n * D^4). Then, using Hooke's Law, F = k * δ. So substituting k into F:

F = (G * d^4 / (8 * n * D^4)) ) * δ.

But we also have the shear stress condition: τ = (16 * F * n) / (π * d * D). From earlier, I think this formula might be correct.

So combining these two equations:

From shear stress: τ = (16 * F * n) / (π * d * D).

From deflection: F = (G * d^4 * δ) / (8 * n * D^4).

Let me substitute F from the deflection equation into the shear stress equation.

So,

τ = (16 * [ (G * d^4 * δ) / (8 * n * D^4) ) ] * n ) / (π * d * D )

Simplify numerator:

16 * G * d^4 * δ * n / (8 * n * D^4) ) = 16 G d^4 δ n / (8 n D^4) ) = (2 G d^4 δ) / D^4.

So,

τ = (2 G d^4 δ) / (D^4 * π d D )

Simplify denominator: π d D.

So,

τ = (2 G d^4 δ) / (π d D D^4 ) = (2 G d^3 δ) / (π D^5 )

Wait, let's see:

Wait, D^4 in denominator from D^4, and another D from π d D, so D^5.

d^4 in numerator, and d in denominator, so d^3.

So,

τ = (2 G d^3 δ) / (π D^5 )

We can solve for δ:

δ = (τ * π D^5 ) / (2 G d^3 )

Now, plug in the known values:

τ = 50,000 psi,

G = 12e6 psi,

D = 2.25 inches,

d = 0.15 inches.

Compute each part:

First, compute D^5: (2.25)^5.

2.25^2 = 5.0625,

2.25^3 = 5.0625 * 2.25 ≈ 11.390625,

2.25^4 ≈ 11.390625 * 2.25 ≈ 25.72265625,

2.25^5 ≈ 25.72265625 * 2.25 ≈ 57.6650390625.

Next, compute d^3: (0.15)^3 = 0.003375.

Now, plug into the equation:

δ = (50,000 * π * 57.6650390625 ) / (2 * 12e6 * 0.003375 )

Compute numerator:

50,000 * π ≈ 50,000 * 3.1416 ≈ 157,080.

157,080 * 57.6650390625 ≈ Let's compute 157,080 * 57.665.

Approximate:

57.665 is about 57.665.

157,080 * 57 = 157,080 * 50 = 7,854,000; 157,080 *7= 1,099,560 → total 8,953,560.

But more accurately, let me compute 57.665 * 157,080.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach:

57.665 * 157,080 = (57.665 * 157,080) = ?

Wait, perhaps I can compute it as:

57.665 * 157,080 = ?

Well, 57.665 = 57 + 0.665.

57 * 157,080 = 57 * 157,080.

57 * 157,080 = (50 * 157,080) + (7 * 157,080) = 7,854,000 + 1,099,560 = 8,953,560.

Now, 0.665 * 157,080 = 0.665 * 157,080.

0.665 * 157,080 = (0.6 * 157,080) + (0.065 *157,080).

0.6 *157,080 = 94,248.

0.065 *157,080 = 10,209.2.

So total: 94,248 +10,209.2 = 104,457.2.

So total numerator is 8,953,560 + 104,457.2 = 9,058,017.2.

Now, denominator: 2 * 12e6 * 0.003375.

Compute 2 * 12e6 = 24e6.

24e6 * 0.003375 = 24e6 * 3.375e-3 = 24 * 3.375 = 81. So 81e3 = 81,000.

So δ = 9,058,017.2 / 81,000 ≈ approximately 111.827 inches.

Wait, that can't be right. The deflection is supposed to not exceed 1.5 inches. But according to this, δ is way beyond that. That suggests I made a mistake in the formula.

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the formula derivation earlier. Let me re-examine.

Wait, perhaps the formula I used is wrong. Let me double-check the shear stress formula for a helical spring.

I think the correct formula for shear stress in a helical spring is τ = (16 * F * n) / (π * d * D). Let me confirm that.

If that's the case, then F can be expressed as F = (τ * π * d * D) / (16 * n).

Then, the deflection δ is given by δ = (F * n^2) / (k), where k is the spring constant. Wait, but k is (G * d^4) / (8 * n * D^4), so δ = F * n^2 / (G * d^4 / (8 * n * D^4)) ) = F * n^2 * 8 * n * D^4 / (G * d^4) ) = F * 8 * n^3 * D^4 / (G * d^4).

But F is (τ * π * d * D) / (16 * n), so substituting:

δ = [ (τ π d D ) / (16 n) ) ] * 8 n^3 D^4 / (G d^4 )

Simplify:

= (τ π d D * 8 n^3 D^4 ) / (16 n G d^4 )

= (τ π D^5 d * 8 n^2 ) / (16 G d^4 )

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me do it step by step.

δ = [ (τ π d D ) / (16 n) ) ] * (8 n^3 D^4) / (G d^4 )

= (τ π d D * 8 n^3 D^4) ) / (16 n G d^4 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= (τ π D^5 d 8 n^3 ) / (16 n G d^4 )

Simplify exponents:

d in numerator is d^1, denominator is d^4 → d^(1-4)=d^-3

n^3 / n = n^(3-1)=n^2.

So,

= (τ π D^5 * 8 n^2 ) / (16 G d^3 )

Simplify 8/16 = 1/2.

= (τ π D^5 n^2 ) / (2 G d^3 )

So,

δ = (τ π D^5 n^2 ) / (2 G d^3 )

We can solve for n^2:

n^2 = (2 G d^3 δ) / (τ π D^5 )

Then,

n = sqrt( (2 G d^3 δ) / (τ π D^5 ) )

Wait, but that's different from what I had earlier. Let me plug in the values now.

Given:

τ = 50,000 psi,

G = 12e6 psi,

d = 0.15 in,

δ = 1.5 in,

D = 2.25 in.

Compute numerator: 2 * 12e6 * (0.15)^3 * 1.5.

First, (0.15)^3 = 0.003375.

So,

2 * 12e6 = 24e6.

24e6 * 0.003375 = 24e6 * 0.003375 = 81,000.

81,000 * 1.5 = 121,500.

Denominator: τ π D^5 = 50,000 * π * (2.25)^5.

As before, (2.25)^5 ≈ 57.6650390625.

So,

50,000 * π ≈ 157,080.

157,080 * 57.6650390625 ≈ Let's compute this accurately.

57.6650390625 * 157,080:

Compute 57 * 157,080 = 8,953,560.

0.6650390625 * 157,080 ≈ 104,457.2.

So total ≈ 8,953,560 + 104,457.2 = 9,058,017.2.

So denominator ≈ 9,058,017.2.

Now,

n^2 = (121,500) / (9,058,017.2) ≈ 0.01341.

Then,

n = sqrt(0.01341) ≈ 0.1158.

Wait, that can't be right because the number of coils can't be less than 1. Did I make a mistake in the formula again?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me check the formula again.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for n is derived differently. Let me try another approach.

Another formula I found is:

n = (8 * F * D^4) / (π^2 * G * d^4 * δ)

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the shear stress formula to find F and then use the deflection formula to find n.

From the shear stress formula:

τ = (16 * F * n) / (π * d * D)

Rearranged to solve for F:

F = (τ * π * d * D) / (16 * n)

Now, the deflection δ is given by:

δ = (8 * F * n^2) / (π^2 * G * D^4) ) * (d^4)

Wait, perhaps that's the correct formula for deflection. Let me see.

So,

δ = (8 * F * n^2 * d^4) / (π^2 * G * D^4)

We can substitute F from the shear stress equation into this.

So,

δ = (8 * [ (τ π d D) / (16 n) ] * n^2 * d^4 ) / (π^2 G D^4 )

Simplify numerator:

8 * (τ π d D) / (16 n) ) * n^2 d^4 = (8 τ π d D n^2 d^4) / (16 n )

Simplify 8/16 = 1/2.

= (τ π d D n^2 d^4 ) * (1/2) * (1/n ) )

= (τ π d^5 D n ) / 2

So,

δ = (τ π d^5 D n ) / (2 π^2 G D^4 )

Simplify π in numerator and denominator:

= (τ d^5 D n ) / (2 π G D^4 )

= (τ d^5 n ) / (2 π G D^3 )

Now, solve for n:

n = (2 π G D^3 δ ) / (τ d^5 )

Plugging in the numbers:

n = (2 * π * 12e6 * (2.25)^3 * 1.5 ) / (50,000 * (0.15)^5 )

Compute each part:

(2.25)^3 = 2.25 * 2.25 * 2.25 = 11.390625.

(0.15)^5 = 0.0000759375.

So,

Numerator: 2 * π * 12e6 * 11.390625 * 1.5.

2 * π ≈ 6.2832.

6.2832 * 12e6 = 75,398,400.

75,398,400 * 11.390625 ≈ Let's compute:

75,398,400 * 10 = 753,984,000.

75,398,400 * 1.390625 ≈ 75,398,400 * 1 = 75,398,400.

75,398,400 * 0.390625 = 75,398,400 * 0.25 = 18,849,600; 0.140625 *75,398,400 ≈ 10,620, 000? Let me compute 75,398,400 * 0.390625:

0.390625 = 25/64.

So 75,398,400 * 25/64 = (75,398,400 /64 ) *25.

75,398,400 /64 = 1,178,100.

1,178,100 *25 = 29,452,500.

So 75,398,400 *1.390625 ≈ 75,398,400 +29,452,500 = 104,850,900.

Now multiply by 1.5: 104,850,900 *1.5 = 157,276,350.

Denominator: 50,000 * 0.0000759375 ≈ 50,000 * 7.59375e-5 = 3.796875.

So,

n ≈ 157,276,350 / 3.796875 ≈ Let me compute this.

Dividing 157,276,350 by 3.796875:

Approximate 3.796875 ≈ 3.8.

157,276,350 / 3.8 ≈ 41,388.513.

Wait, that can't be right because the number of coils is way too high. I must have messed up the formula again.

This is getting frustrating. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Another approach: Use the spring rate formula and the shear stress formula together.

The spring rate k is given by:

k = (G * d^4) / (8 * n * D^4)

Shear stress τ is given by:

τ = (16 * F * n) / (π * d * D)

From Hooke's Law, F = k * δ.

Substitute F into the shear stress equation:

τ = (16 * (k * δ) * n) / (π * d * D)

But k is (G d^4) / (8 n D^4), so:

τ = (16 * (G d^4 δ / (8 n D^4)) ) * n ) / (π d D )

Simplify numerator:

16 * G d^4 δ n / (8 n D^4) ) = 2 G d^4 δ / D^4.

So,

τ = (2 G d^4 δ) / (D^4 π d D )

Simplify denominator:

D^4 * D = D^5.

d in denominator: d.

So,

τ = (2 G d^3 δ) / (π D^5 )

Now, solve for δ:

δ = (τ π D^5 ) / (2 G d^3 )

Plug in the numbers:

τ =50,000,

G=12e6,

D=2.25,

d=0.15,

π=3.1416.

Compute D^5: 2.25^5 = approx 57.665.

d^3: 0.15^3=0.003375.

So,

δ = (50,000 * 3.1416 * 57.665 ) / (2 * 12e6 * 0.003375 )

Compute numerator: 50,000 * 3.1416 ≈157,080.

157,080 *57.665 ≈ 157,080 *57=8,953,560; 157,080 *0.665≈104,457.2 → total≈9,058,017.2.

Denominator: 2 *12e6=24e6.

24e6 *0.003375=24e6 *3.375e-3=81,000.

So,

δ=9,058,017.2 /81,000 ≈111.827 inches. But the maximum deflection allowed is 1.5 inches. So this suggests that with the given parameters, the deflection would be way over. But that can't be, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the formula is wrong. Maybe I should use the correct formula for deflection and shear stress.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula:

n = (8 * F * D^4) / (π^2 * G * d^4 * δ )

But without F, I can't use this. Alternatively, I can combine the shear stress equation with the deflection equation to eliminate F.

From shear stress:

F = (τ π d D ) / (16 n )

From deflection:

δ = (8 F n^2 d^4 ) / (π^2 G D^4 )

Substitute F into deflection equation:

δ = (8 * [ (τ π d D ) / (16 n) ] * n^2 d^4 ) / (π^2 G D^4 )

Simplify numerator:

8 * τ π d D / 16 n * n^2 d^4 = (8 τ π d D n^2 d^4 ) / (16 n )

= (τ π d^5 D n ) / 2

So,

δ = (τ π d^5 D n ) / (2 π^2 G D^4 )

Simplify π and D:

= (τ d^5 n ) / (2 π G D^3 )

Solve for n:

n = (2 π G D^3 δ ) / (τ d^5 )

Now plug in the numbers:

n = (2 * π * 12e6 * (2.25)^3 *1.5 ) / (50,000 * (0.15)^5 )

Compute each part:

2 * π ≈6.2832.

12e6 *6.2832 ≈75,398,400.

(2.25)^3=11.390625.

75,398,400 *11.390625 ≈75,398,400*10=753,984,000; 75,398,400 *1.390625≈104,850,900 → total≈858,834,900.

Multiply by 1.5: 858,834,900 *1.5≈1,288,252,350.

Denominator:50,000 * (0.15)^5.

(0.15)^5=0.0000759375.

50,000 *0.0000759375=3.796875.

So,

n≈1,288,252,350 /3.796875 ≈339,440. So that's way too high. Clearly, something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula for deflection. Let me check a standard source. The correct formula for deflection of a helical spring is δ = (F * n^2 * d^4) / (8 * G * D^4).

So, δ = (F n^2 d^4) / (8 G D^4).

From shear stress, F = (τ π d D ) / (16 n ).

Substitute F into deflection:

δ = [ (τ π d D ) / (16 n ) ] * n^2 d^4 / (8 G D^4 )

Simplify:

= (τ π d D n^2 d^4 ) / (16 n *8 G D^4 )

= (τ π d^5 D n ) / (128 G D^4 )

= (τ π d^5 n ) / (128 G D^3 )

Solve for n:

n = (128 G D^3 δ ) / (τ π d^5 )

Now plug in the numbers:

G=12e6,

D=2.25,

d=0.15,

τ=50,000,

δ=1.5,

π≈3.1416.

Compute numerator: 128 *12e6 * (2.25)^3 *1.5.

128 *12e6 =1,536e6.

(2.25)^3=11.390625.

1,536e6 *11.390625=1,536e6 *10=15,360e6; 1,536e6*1.390625≈2,139,  600e3? Wait, perhaps better to compute 1,536e6 *11.390625.

11.390625 *1,536e6 = 11.390625 *1,536,000,000.

= (11 *1,536e6) + (0.390625 *1,536e6)

11 *1,536e6=16,896e6.

0.390625 *1,536e6= (1,536e6 * 0.390625)= (1,536,000,000 * 0.390625)= 598,560,000.

So total numerator part:16,896e6 +598,560,000 = 17,494,560,000.

Multiply by 1.5: 17,494,560,000 *1.5=26,241,840,000.

Denominator: τ π d^5 =50,000 *3.1416*(0.15)^5.

(0.15)^5=0.0000759375.

50,000 *3.1416=157,080.

157,080 *0.0000759375≈157,080 *7.59375e-5≈157,080 *0.0000759375≈11.935.

So,

n=26,241,840,000 /11.935≈2,200,000, which is way too high.

This isn't making sense. I must be using the wrong formula. Let me try to find another way.

Perhaps I should use the formula for the number of coils n in terms of shear stress and deflection.

I found that the number of coils can be calculated using:

n = (8 * G * D^4 * δ) / (π^2 * d^4 * τ )

Wait, let's try that.

n = (8 * G * D^4 * δ) / (π^2 * d^4 * τ )

Plugging in the values:

G=12e6,

D=2.25,

δ=1.5,

d=0.15,

τ=50,000,

π^2≈9.8696.

Compute numerator:8 *12e6 * (2.25)^4 *1.5.

(2.25)^4=25.62890625.

8 *12e6=96e6.

96e6 *25.62890625≈96e6 *25=2,400e6; 96e6 *0.62890625≈60,345,000.

Total≈2,400e6 +60,345,000=2,460,345,000.

Multiply by 1.5:2,460,345,000 *1.5=3,690,517,500.

Denominator: π^2 * (0.15)^4 *50,000.

(0.15)^4=0.00050625.

π^2≈9.8696.

So,

9.8696 *0.00050625≈0.004994.

0.004994 *50,000≈249.7.

So,

n≈3,690,517,500 /249.7≈14,764. So n≈14,764. That's way too high; number of coils can't be that large.

I must be making a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

n = (8 * G * D^4 * δ) / (π^2 * d^4 * τ )

Which is what I used. But the result is way off.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

n = sqrt( (8 * G * D^4 * δ) / (π^2 * d^4 * τ ) )

But that would give sqrt(3,690,517,500 /249.7)≈sqrt(14,764)≈121.5. Still too high.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Another source says:

n = (8 * F * D^4) / (π^2 * G * d^4 * δ )

But without F, I can't use this. Alternatively, using F from shear stress.

F = (τ π d D ) / (16 n )

Substitute into deflection formula:

δ = (F n^2 d^4) / (8 G D^4 )

= [ (τ π d D ) / (16 n ) ) * n^2 d^4 ] / (8 G D^4 )

= (τ π d D n^2 d^4 ) / (16 n *8 G D^4 )

= (τ π d^5 D n ) / (128 G D^4 )

= τ π d^5 n / (128 G D^3 )

Solve for n:

n = (128 G D^3 δ ) / (τ π d^5 )

Now plug in the numbers:

G=12e6,

D=2.25,

d=0.15,

τ=50,000,

δ=1.5,

π≈3.1416.

Compute numerator:

128 *12e6=1,536e6.

D^3=2.25^3=11.390625.

1,536e6 *11.390625=17,494,560,000.

Multiply by δ=1.5:17,494,560,000 *1.5=26,241,840,000.

Denominator:

τ π d^5=50,000 *3.1416*(0.15)^5.

(0.15)^5=0.0000759375.

50,000 *3.1416=157,080.

157,080 *0.0000759375≈11.935.

So,

n=26,241,840,000 /11.935≈2,200,000.

This can't be right. I'm getting a number of coils in the millions, which is impossible.

I think I'm stuck and probably making a mistake in the formula. Perhaps I should look for a different approach or a different formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the number of coils is:

n = (8 * F * D^4) / (π^2 * G * d^4 * δ )

But without F, I can't proceed. Alternatively, using F from shear stress:

F = (τ π d D ) / (16 n )

Substitute into deflection formula:

δ = (F n^2 d^4 ) / (8 G D^4 )

= [ (τ π d D ) / (16 n ) ) * n^2 d^4 ] / (8 G D^4 )

= (τ π d D n^2 d^4 ) / (16 n *8 G D^4 )

= (τ π d^5 D n ) / (128 G D^4 )

= (τ π d^5 n ) / (128 G D^3 )

Rearranged:

n = (128 G D^3 δ ) / (τ π d^5 )

Plugging in the same numbers again:

n = (128 *12e6 * (2.25)^3 *1.5 ) / (50,000 * π * (0.15)^5 )

Compute numerator:

128 *12e6=1,536e6.

(2.25)^3=11.390625.

1,536e6 *11.390625=17,494,560,000.

Multiply by 1.5:26,241,840,000.

Denominator:

50,000 * π * (0.15)^5=50,000 *3.1416 *0.0000759375≈50,000 *0.0002387≈11.935.

So,

n=26,241,840,000 /11.935≈2,200,000.

This can't be correct. I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the shear modulus G is given, but in some sources, the formula uses modulus of elasticity E instead. Let me check.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for the number of coils is:

n = (8 * F * D^4) / (G * d^4 * δ )

But then F can be found from shear stress.

Alternatively, perhaps I should give up and look for a standard formula.

Wait, I found a standard formula for the number of coils in a helical spring to limit deflection and shear stress.

The formula is:

n = (8 * F * D^4) / (G * d^4 * δ )

But we also have shear stress τ = (16 * F * n) / (π * d * D )

We can solve these two equations for n.

From shear stress:

F = (τ * π * d * D) / (16 * n )

Substitute F into n's equation:

n = (8 * (τ π d D / (16 n )) * D^4 ) / (G d^4 δ )

Simplify:

n = (8 * τ π d D D^4 ) / (16 n G d^4 δ )

Multiply both sides by n:

n^2 = (8 τ π d D^5 ) / (16 G d^4 δ )

Simplify 8/16=0.5,

n^2 = (0.5 τ π D^5 ) / (G d^3 δ )

So,

n = sqrt( (0.5 τ π D^5 ) / (G d^3 δ ) )

Now plug in the numbers:

τ=50,000,

π≈3.1416,

D=2.25,

G=12e6,

d=0.15,

δ=1.5.

Compute numerator:0.5 *50,000 *3.1416 * (2.25)^5.

0.5*50,000=25,000.

25,000 *3.1416≈78,540.

(2.25)^5≈57.665.

78,540 *57.665≈4,530,717.

Denominator:12e6 * (0.15)^3 *1.5.

(0.15)^3=0.003375.

12e6 *0.003375=40,500.

40,500 *1.5=60,750.

So,

n= sqrt(4,530,717 /60,750 )≈sqrt(74.53)≈8.63.

So n≈8.63. Looking at the options, the closest is option G:8, but there's no 8.63. Hmm, option I is 9, which is close.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculation.

Compute numerator:

0.5 *50,000=25,000.

25,000 * π≈78,539.81634.

(2.25)^5=57.6650390625.

78,539.81634 *57.6650390625≈Let me compute accurately:

78,539.81634 *57=4,516,663.617.

78,539.81634 *0.6650390625≈78,539.81634 *0.6=47,123.8898; 0.0650390625 *78,539.81634≈5,102. So total≈47,123.89 +5,102≈52,225.89.

Total numerator≈4,516,663.617 +52,225.89≈4,568,889.5.

Denominator:12e6 * (0.15)^3 *1.5.

(0.15)^3=0.003375.

12e6 *0.003375=40,500.

40,500 *1.5=60,750.

So,

n= sqrt(4,568,889.5 /60,750 )=sqrt(75.23)≈8.673.

So approximately 8.673 coils.

Looking at the options, the closest is option G:8 or I:9.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me check the exact value.

Compute 4,568,889.5 /60,750.

60,750 *75=4,556,250.

4,568,889.5 -4,556,250=12,639.5.

So 75 + (12,639.5 /60,750 )≈75 +0.208≈75.208.

Wait, no, wait: 4,568,889.5 /60,750= approx 75.208.

So sqrt(75.208)= approx 8.673.

So n≈8.673. So the nearest whole number is 9. So the answer would be option I:9.

But looking at the options, option I is 9, which is choice I.
</think>

To calculate the number of coils \( n \) of a helical spring such that the deflection \( \delta \) does not exceed 1.5 inches, we use the relationship between shear stress \( \tau \), shear modulus \( G \), mean diameter \( D \), wire diameter \( d \), and deflection \( \delta \). The formula derived is:

\[
n = \sqrt{\frac{0.5 \cdot \tau \cdot \pi \cdot D^5}{G \cdot d^3 \cdot \delta}}
\]

### Given Parameters:
- \( \tau = 50,000 \, \text{psi} \)
- \( G = 12 \times 10^6 \, \text{psi} \)
- \( D = 2.25 \, \text{in} \)
- \( d = 0.15 \, \text{in} \)
- \( \delta = 1.5 \, \text{in} \)
- \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \)

### Step 1: Compute \( D^5 \)
\[
D^5 = (2.25)^5 \approx 57.665
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( d^3 \)
\[
d^3 = (0.15)^3 = 0.003375
\]

### Step 3: Compute Numerator
\[
0.5 \cdot \tau \cdot \pi \cdot D^5 = 0.5 \cdot 50,000 \cdot 3.1416 \cdot 57.665 \approx 4,568,889.5
\]

### Step 4: Compute Denominator
\[
G \cdot d^3 \cdot \delta = 12 \times 10^6 \cdot 0.003375 \cdot 1.5 = 60,750
\]

### Step 5: Compute \( n \)
\[
n = \sqrt{\frac{4,568,889.5}{60,750}} \approx \sqrt{75.208} \approx 8.673
\]

### Step 6: Round to Nearest Whole Number
The closest whole number to \( 8.673 \) is \( 9 \).

### Final Answer:
The number of coils required is approximately **9**, which corresponds to option **I**.

**Answer: I**
