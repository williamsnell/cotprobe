Okay, so I have this question about the differences in social networks between older and younger adults. The question is asking what's different, specifically about older adults. The options are from A to J, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember reading somewhere that as people age, their social networks tend to change. I think older adults might have smaller networks compared to younger ones. Younger people are usually more active on social media and have more connections as they build their lives, like through work, school, and hobbies.

Wait, but I'm not sure if it's the overall network or just the inner circles. I recall that older adults might have a more tightly-knit group of friends, meaning their inner circles are smaller. They might lose friends over time due to moving, changing jobs, or even health issues. So their immediate circle gets smaller, but maybe their wider network isn't necessarily larger.

Looking at the options, option C is "Smaller networks overall." That seems plausible because older adults might have fewer connections. But then option E is "Smaller inner circles," which also sounds right because their close friends might decrease. So which is it?

I think the key here is whether the question is referring to the entire network or just the core group. I believe it's more about the inner circles. Younger adults might have larger networks overall, with more acquaintances, but older adults have smaller, more intimate groups. So maybe option E is correct.

Wait, but another thought: some studies suggest that while older adults might have fewer overall connections, their inner circles are smaller, but their networks can sometimes be more dispersed because they might live far from their friends or family. So option D is "More dispersed circles." Hmm, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps older adults have more dispersed networks because they have moved less, or maybe they have friends spread out geographically. But I'm not certain.

But going back, I think the main point is that older adults have smaller inner circles. So the answer would be E. Or maybe the overall network is smaller, which is option C.

Wait another angle: younger adults are more likely to use social media, which can inflate the size of their networks because they can connect with more people online. Whereas older adults might rely more on face-to-face interactions, leading to smaller networks overall. So option C could be correct.

I'm a bit confused between C and E. Let me think again. The question is a difference, so what's true for older adults. If it's about the size of the network, older might have smaller. But if it's about the tightness, then inner circles would be smaller.

I think I've read that older adults have more selective and smaller inner circles, so their close relationships are fewer, but their outer circles (like acquaintances) might not necessarily be smaller. So the correct answer would be E: Smaller inner circles.

The answer is E: Smaller inner circles.
