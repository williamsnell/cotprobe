Okay, so I have this question about the OKWS design and what would break if Unix didn't allow passing file descriptors between processes but still allowed inheriting them on fork and exec. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my Unix internals, but I'll try to think this through.

First, I need to understand the question properly. The scenario is that file descriptors can't be passed between processes, but when a process forks or execs, it can inherit the parent's file descriptors. So, how does this affect the OKWS design?

OKWS stands for Open Kernel Web Services, right? From what I remember, it's a design where the web server is in the kernel, handling requests, and then passing the handling off to user-space processes. So, services like Apache or Nginx might fork worker processes to handle each request.

In the OKWS model, when a request comes in, the kernel-based server would accept the connection and then pass it off to a worker process. But for that to work, the worker process needs the file descriptor for the client's socket. If file descriptors can't be passed between processes, how would the worker get that socket?

Wait, but the question says that file descriptors can be inherited on fork and exec. So when a child process is created via fork, it inherits the parent's file descriptors. But can it pass them to another process? Like, if the kernel server forks a new process, that child would get the same file descriptors as the parent.

But wait, in the case of OKWS, the kernel server would typically send the file descriptor to the worker process via some mechanism, maybe using something like passing the fd over a pipe or using a special system call. If file descriptors can't be passed between processes, even via such methods, then the worker wouldn't be able to get the socket fd.

Wait, but if the kernel server can't pass the fd to the worker, how does the worker handle the connection? Because the worker needs that socket to read from the client. So that would break the first aspect, making it impossible for services to get a TCP connection to the client browser. So statement 1 would be true.

Now the second part: would it be impossible for okd to run as a non-root user? Okd is the kernel server part in OKWS. Kernel mode code runs with root privileges. But if the kernel server can't pass file descriptors to user-space processes, does that affect whether okd can run as non-root?

Wait, no. The kernel server itself runs in kernel mode, so it's always running as root, regardless of whether the user-space processes run as non-root. The inability to pass file descriptors affects the user-space processes, not the kernel server's ability to run as a non-root user. Wait, but kernel-mode processes can't run as non-root; they're always root. So maybe the second statement is irrelevant.

Wait, the question is whether okd can run as a non-root user. But since it's in kernel mode, it can't run as a non-root user. So the second statement says it's impossible for okd to run as a non-root user. But wait, is that even possible? Because kernel-mode processes are always root. So if the question is about the inability to run as non-root, that's impossible regardless of file descriptors. So the second statement is true because it's impossible for a kernel process to run as non-root.

Wait, no. The question is phrased: "it would be impossible for okd to run as a non-root user." But actually, kernel-mode code can't run as non-root. So the statement is true because it's impossible. So if file descriptors can't be passed, does that affect whether okd can run as non-root? I don't think so. Because the inability to pass fds affects the user-space workers, not the kernel server's ability to run as non-root. But the kernel server can't run as non-root anyway. So the second statement is true regardless.

Wait, but the question is about whether the aspects would break. So, statement 1: without passing fds, services (like the worker processes) can't get the TCP connection. So statement 1 is true. Statement 2: it's impossible for okd to run as a non-root user. But wait, okd is in kernel mode, so it's always running as root. So the statement says it's impossible for okd to run as a non-root user, which is true because kernel processes can't run as non-root. So both statements are true.

But wait, the options are about whether each statement is true or false. The question is, which aspects would break. So statement 1 is true because services can't get the connection. Statement 2 is also true because okd can't run as non-root.

Wait, but the options don't have an "both true" except option D. But looking back, the options are:

A: True, False
B: Partially false, True
C: Partially false, False
D: True, True
E: Partially true, True
F: True, Partially true
G: Partially true, False
H: False, True
I: False, Partially true
J: False, False

Wait, but earlier I thought statement 2 is true. But maybe I'm wrong. Because the inability to pass fds doesn't affect whether okd can run as non-root. Because the kernel server can't run as non-root anyway, regardless of file descriptor passing. So the inability to pass fds doesn't make it impossible for okd to run as non-root; it's already impossible. So the second statement is true regardless of the fd passing. Or is the second statement saying that okd cannot run as non-root because of the inability to pass fds? That's not the case. The inability to pass fds doesn't affect the kernel server's ability to run as non-root (which is impossible anyway). So statement 2 is true because it's impossible for okd to run as non-root, but the reason is not related to the file descriptor passing. So the second statement is true regardless.

Wait, but the question is about aspects that would break without file descriptor passing. So the second statement's truth is independent of file descriptor passing. So the aspects that would break are the first (services can't get connections) but the second (okd can't run as non-root) is always true. So the question is whether each statement is true or false given the scenario.

Wait, the question is: What aspects of the OKWS design would break? So if the scenario is removing the ability to pass fds, what breaks? The first aspect (services getting connections) would break because they can't get the fds. The second aspect (okd running as non-root) isn't affected by the fd passing; it's always impossible. So the second statement is true regardless, but the question is whether the aspect would break due to the lack of fd passing. So maybe the second statement is not affected by the scenario. So in the scenario, the first aspect breaks, but the second aspect was already broken and not affected by the change.

Wait, the second statement says: "it would be impossible for okd to run as a non-root user." But in reality, kernel-mode processes can't run as non-root. So the statement is true regardless of file descriptor passing. So the aspect (okd running as non-root) is impossible regardless. So in the scenario, the aspect doesn't break because of the lack of file descriptor passing; it's already broken. So the second statement is true, but it's not because of the scenario. It's a separate issue.

Wait, but the question is, what aspects would break without file descriptor passing. So if without file descriptor passing, the first aspect breaks, but the second aspect was already broken. So the first statement is true, the second statement is also true because it's impossible regardless. So both aspects would be true. But the second aspect's impossibility is not because of the file descriptor change.

Alternatively, perhaps the second statement is not true in the scenario. Because without file descriptor passing, maybe okd can still run as non-root, but that's impossible because kernel processes can't. So the second statement is true regardless. So the correct answer would be both statements are true, so option D.

But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the second statement. The statement says it's impossible for okd to run as a non-root user. But if the kernel server (okd) can't pass file descriptors, does that affect its ability to run as non-root? Probably not. Because the inability to pass fds affects how it hands off connections to user-space, but the kernel server's own privilege level is separate.

So in the scenario, the first aspect breaks (services can't get connections) because they can't receive the fds. The second aspect, whether okd can run as non-root, is still impossible because kernel processes can't run as non-root. So the statement is true regardless. So both statements are true. Therefore, the answer would be D: True, True.
</think>

The OKWS design relies on passing file descriptors between processes, particularly from the kernel server to user-space worker processes. If file descriptors cannot be passed, worker processes cannot receive the socket file descriptors needed to handle client connections, making it impossible for services to get a TCP connection to the client web browser. This means the first statement is true.

Regarding the second statement, kernel-mode processes like `okd` always run as root and cannot run as non-root users, regardless of file descriptor passing. Thus, the statement is true, but it is not directly affected by the inability to pass file descriptors. However, since the question asks what aspects would break, and the second statement is true regardless of the scenario, both statements are true.
