Okay, so I need to find phi(29791), where phi is Euler's Totient Function. Hmm, I remember that Euler's Totient Function counts the number of integers up to a given integer n that are relatively prime to n. So, phi(n) is the count of numbers less than n that don't share any common factors with n except 1.

First, I should probably factorize 29791 to find its prime factors. Because the totient function is easier to compute if I know the prime factors. I remember that for a number n with prime factorization n = p1^k1 * p2^k2 * ... * pr^kr, the totient function is phi(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pr).

So, let me try to factorize 29791. I'm not sure what it is off the top of my head, but maybe I can check if it's a prime or a composite number. Let me try dividing it by some small primes.

Is 29791 even? No, because it ends with a 1, so it's not divisible by 2. Let's try 3: sum of digits is 2+9+7+9+1=28, which is not divisible by 3, so 3 doesn't divide it. Next, 5: it doesn't end with 0 or 5, so no. How about 7? Let me do 29791 ÷ 7. 7 goes into 29 four times (28), remainder 1. Bring down the 7: 17. 7 into 17 is 2, 14, remainder 3. Bring down the 9: 39. 7 into 39 is 5, 35, remainder 4. Bring down the 1: 41. 7 into 41 is 5, 35, remainder 6. So not divisible by 7.

Next, 11. The rule for 11 is alternating sum: (2 - 9 + 7 - 9 + 1) = (2-9)= -7, (7-9)= -2, +1 gives -8. Not divisible by 11. How about 13? Let me try 13. Hmm, this might take a while, but maybe there's a better approach. Wait, I recall that 29791 is a prime number? Or is it? Wait, no, I think 29791 is actually 31^3 because 31*31=961, and 961*31=29791. Let me check that.

31 * 31 is 961. Then 961 *31: let's compute that. 961 *30 is 28,830, plus 961 is 29,791. Yes! So 29791 is 31^3, so n = 31^3.

Now, since 31 is a prime number, the totient function for n = p^k is p^k - p^(k-1), or more generally, phi(p^k) = p^k * (1 - 1/p) = p^(k) - p^(k-1).

So for n =31^3, phi(n) = 31^3 - 31^2. Let's compute that.

31^3 is 29791, as we saw. 31^2 is 961. So phi(29791) = 29791 - 961 = 28830.

Looking at the options, option J is 28830. So the answer should be J.

The number 29791 is 31³, and since 31 is prime, phi(31³) = 31³ - 31² = 29791 - 961 = 28830.

Answer: J
