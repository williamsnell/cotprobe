Question:

A 46-year-old man with Marfan syndrome, aortic insufficiency, and mitral regurgitation comes to the emergency department because he has had severe substernal chest pain for the past 3 hours. He describes the pain as tearing in quality and radiating to the neck. One week earlier he experienced similar but less severe chest pain and treated himself with aspirin. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause for his worsening symptoms?

Options:

A: Dissection of the aorta
B: Pulmonary embolism
C: Mitral valve prolapse
D: Gastroesophageal reflux disease
E: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
F: Ventricular septal defect
G: Stable angina
H: Acute myocardial infarction
I: Esophageal reflux with spasm
J: Acute bacterial endocarditis

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this medical question. Let me read through it again carefully.

The patient is a 46-year-old man with Marfan syndrome, aortic insufficiency, and mitral regurgitation. He comes to the ER with severe substernal chest pain for the past 3 hours. The pain is tearing in quality and radiates to the neck. A week ago, he had similar but less severe pain and treated himself with aspirin. The options are various cardiac and other conditions.

First, I need to consider his medical history. Marfan syndrome is a connective tissue disorder that can weaken the aorta, making it prone to aneurysms and dissections. He already has aortic insufficiency and mitral regurgitation, which are valvular issues, probably due to the syndrome.

His current symptoms: severe chest pain, substernal, tearing, radiating to the neck. That's a classic description of aortic dissection. The pain is sudden and tearing, often radiating to the back or neck. Marfan patients are at higher risk for aortic issues.

He had similar pain a week ago but treated it with aspirin. Maybe the initial episode was a warning sign, like a small tear or a pre-dissection. Now it's worse, so it might have progressed to a full dissection.

Looking at the options:

A: Aortic dissection – this seems likely because of the symptoms and his history.

B: Pulmonary embolism – usually presents with sudden onset of chest pain, dyspnea, maybe pleuritic pain. Radiation to the neck isn't typical.

C: Mitral valve prolapse – can cause chest pain, but it's more often a sharp, central chest pain, maybe associated with clicks or fluttering. Doesn't match the tearing description.

D: GERD – can cause substernal pain, but it's usually more burning, maybe worse after eating, and doesn't radiate to the neck in a tearing manner.

E: COPD – usually presents with chronic cough, dyspnea, maybe chest pain, but not tearing.

F: Ventricular septal defect – more related to congenital heart issues, less likely in a 46-year-old with Marfan.

G: Stable angina – usually predictable, related to exertion, doesn't have tearing quality.

H: Acute MI – chest pain is more crushing, associated with ECG changes, nausea, etc. Radiation to neck is possible, but the tearing quality is different.

I: Esophageal reflux with spasm – similar to GERD, burning pain, not tearing.

J: Acute bacterial endocarditis – usually presents with fever, chills, heart murmur, and pain, but not tearing.

So considering all this, the most likely cause is aortic dissection (A). Marfan patients are high risk, the symptoms fit, and the progression from mild to severe pain suggests it's getting worse.

The patient's history of Marfan syndrome, aortic insufficiency, and mitral regurgitation places him at high risk for aortic complications. The severe, tearing chest pain radiating to the neck is characteristic of aortic dissection. The progression from mild to severe symptoms over a week further supports this diagnosis. Other options, such as pulmonary embolism or acute myocardial infarction, do not align with the tearing quality and radiation of pain described.

Answer: A
