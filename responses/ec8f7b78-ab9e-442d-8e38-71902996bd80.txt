Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about whether an increase in national income is equivalent to an increase in employment. I'm a bit new to economics, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I need to understand what national income means. I think it refers to the total income earned by all factors of production in a country, including wages, profits, and rent. So, when national income increases, the country's overall economic output is going up.

Now, the question is asking if this increase directly leads to more employment. I remember something about the relationship between economic growth and employment. I think it's not always straightforward. Like, if the economy grows, does that always mean more people get jobs?

Option C says yes, every increase in national income always results in more employment. That seems too absolute. I've heard of cases where the economy grows, but employment doesn't necessarily rise, maybe because of automation or companies becoming more efficient without hiring more people. So C might not be correct.

Option E says no, not every increase in national income results in more employment. That makes sense because, as I thought, sometimes economic growth can be due to productivity gains rather than hiring more workers. So E is a possibility.

Option B says an increase in national income leads to more employment when driven by technology advancements. Wait, but technology advancements can sometimes lead to job displacement, like how automation reduces the need for certain jobs. So maybe B isn't correct because it's not a sure thing.

Option H says an increase in national income results in more employment only if productivity growth is equivalent. Hmm, I'm not sure I get that. Maybe if productivity grows at the same rate as income, then employment increases. But I'm not certain about that logic. I'll have to think more.

Option I suggests that national income correlates with employment, but other factors like labor policies are more influential. That sounds plausible because policies can affect employment regardless of income growth. For example, if a country has strict labor laws, it might not matter how much the economy grows; employment might not increase as much.

Option J says employment increases only when income exceeds inflation. I'm not sure about that. I think employment can increase even if income growth is just keeping up with inflation, depending on other factors like job market conditions.

Looking back, the key point is whether an increase in national income always leads to employment growth. From what I recall, it's not a direct one-to-one relationship. Economic growth can sometimes lead to structural changes where certain industries lose jobs while others gain, but overall employment might not always go up. Moreover, factors like technological changes, globalization, and labor market policies play significant roles.

So, the options that stand out are E and I. E says no, every increase doesn't necessarily lead to employment. I says there's a correlation but other factors are more influential.

Wait, the question is whether the increase is equivalent. So if they're equivalent, then yes. But if not, then no. The question is phrased as "Is an increase in national income equivalent to an increase in employment?" So it's a yes/no question, but the options are more nuanced.

Option E directly answers the question with a "No," stating that not every increase results in employment. Option I talks about correlation but doesn't directly answer equivalence; it's more about other factors being more influential.

So, the correct answer should be E because it directly addresses that an increase in national income doesn't always lead to more employment.

The question asks whether an increase in national income is equivalent to an increase in employment. National income refers to the total income earned by all factors of production in a country. The key consideration is whether this increase always leads to more employment.

Option C is too absolute, as economic growth can sometimes lead to job displacement due to factors like automation. Option E correctly states that not every increase in national income results in employment growth, highlighting that other factors such as productivity gains or structural changes can influence employment independently of income growth.

Therefore, the correct answer is E.

Answer: E
