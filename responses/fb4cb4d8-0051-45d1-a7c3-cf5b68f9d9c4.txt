Question:

During assigned seat-work time, Mary, a firstgrade student, sometimes leaves her seat and attempts to play with a block collection. When she leaves her seat, she fails to complete her seat work. Which of the following behavioral intervention strategies will most effectively increase the long-term likelihood that Mary will complete her seat work?

Options:

A: Instituting a class-wide reward system for staying in seats during work time
B: Giving Mary additional seat work as a consequence for leaving her seat
C: Having a one-on-one talk with Mary about the importance of discipline in class
D: Allowing Mary to read from a teacherselected book for a specific period of time before beginning her seat work
E: Removing the blocks from the classroom during the assigned seat-work time
F: Assigning a classmate to monitor Mary's behavior during seat-work time
G: Allowing Mary to play with the blocks afterward if she remains in her seat throughout the assigned seat-work time
H: Explaining to Mary the value of completing seat work in terms of the objectives of the lesson
I: Allowing Mary to play with the blocks while doing her seat work
J: Ignoring Mary when she leaves her seat to play with the blocks

Answer:

Okay, so I have this question about behavioral interventions for Mary, a first-grade student who sometimes leaves her seat to play with blocks during seat work. The main issue is that when she leaves her seat, she doesn't finish her work. The question is asking which intervention would most effectively increase the long-term likelihood that Mary will complete her seat work.

Let me read through the options again and think about each one.

Option A: A class-wide reward system for staying in seats. That might work because it involves the whole class, making it a group effort. But would Mary be motivated just because others are? It might help, but maybe it's not specific to Mary's behavior.

Option B: Giving Mary extra seat work as a consequence. That seems like a punishment, but sometimes that can lead to resentment or more avoidance. Plus, it doesn't teach her how to stay on task; it just adds more work, which might not solve the underlying issue.

Option C: Having a one-on-one talk about discipline. Talks can be good, but without a clear plan or consequence, Mary might not change her behavior. She might understand why she shouldn't leave her seat, but without reinforcement, it might not stick.

Option D: Allow Mary to read a book before starting work. I'm not sure how that would help. Maybe it's a way to engage her, but if she's leaving her seat to play with blocks, giving her a different activity might not address the root cause.

Option E: Remove the blocks from the classroom. That could reduce the temptation, but it's a bit extreme. Plus, other students might use the blocks, so removing them might not be feasible or fair.

Option F: Assign a classmate to monitor Mary. This could have peer pressure, but it might make Mary feel watched and increase anxiety. Also, relying on others to monitor might not be effective in the long run.

Option G: Allow Mary to play with blocks if she stays in her seat the whole time. This sounds like a positive reinforcement. If she stays, she gets to play afterward, which could motivate her to stay on task. It's a conditional reward, which can be effective.

Option H: Explain the value of seat work in terms of lesson objectives. Similar to option C, this is informative but might not provide enough motivation. Mary might not connect the explanation to her own behavior change.

Option I: Allow Mary to play with blocks while doing her work. This might let her satisfy her desire to play without leaving her seat, but it could also be a distraction. She might focus more on the blocks than her work, leading to incomplete tasks.

Option J: Ignore when she leaves her seat. This is a form of extinction, but if leaving her seat gets her attention (like playing with blocks), ignoring it might not stop the behavior. It could even increase it if she's seeking attention or finds the activity rewarding.

So, considering all options, the most effective strategy seems to be Option G. It uses positive reinforcement by allowing Mary to play with the blocks after she completes her work. This gives her an incentive to stay in her seat and finish her tasks, which should increase the likelihood of her completing her seat work over time.

The most effective strategy is to use positive reinforcement by allowing Mary to play with the blocks after she completes her seat work, providing her with an incentive to stay on task.
