Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the Pleistocene ice masses in North America, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about this topic.

The question is asking which ice mass was centered in the Rocky Mountains during the Pleistocene period. The options are A through J, with various names like Mississippi, Rocky Mountain, Appalachian, and others. 

I remember that during the Ice Ages, especially the Pleistocene epoch, there were large ice sheets and glaciers in North America. Two major ice masses I've heard about are the Laurentide Ice Sheet and the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. The Laurentide was centered over the Canadian Shield, covering most of what is now Canada and extending into the northern United States. The Cordilleran Ice Sheet, on the other hand, was more focused on the western part of North America, including the Rocky Mountains area. 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. I think the Rocky Mountains region had several ice fields and glaciers, but they were part of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. So maybe the answer is related to that. Let me think about the options again. Option J is Cordilleran, so that's a possibility.

Another option is H, which is Laurentide. But I'm pretty sure Laurentide was more eastward, covering the area that's now the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Valley. So that's probably not the one centered in the Rockies.

Option B is Rocky Mountain. Hmm, I'm not sure if that's the correct term. I think the term used is Cordilleran, which refers to the ice masses along the Cordilleran region, which includes the Rocky Mountains. So B might not be the right choice because the question is asking for the name of the ice mass, not just describing its location.

Option I is Beringia, which I believe refers to the area around the Bering Strait, part of eastern Russia and Alaska. So that's probably not it either.

Option E is Pacifica. I'm not too sure about that one. I think that might refer to a different region, maybe along the west coast, but not the Rockies.

Option F is Cascadian. That might relate to the Cascade Range, which is part of the Pacific Northwest. So that's more west than the Rockies.

Option G is Sierra Nevada, which is a mountain range in California, so that's not the Rockies either.

Option D is McKenzie Corridor. I'm not as familiar with that term, but I think it refers to a passageway in the Rockies where the ice might have flowed, but not the ice mass itself.

So putting it all together, the ice mass centered in the Rocky Mountains during the Pleistocene was probably the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. That would correspond to option J. I think I'm confident with that choice.

The Pleistocene ice mass in North America centered in the Rocky Mountains was the Cordilleran Ice Sheet.
