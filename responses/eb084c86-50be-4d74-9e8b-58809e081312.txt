Question:

While treating a client, you decide that you want to consult with a colleague to discuss a specific aspect of the case that is giving you trouble. According to APA’s Ethics Code and the Canadian Code of Ethics:

C: you must obtain permission from the client only if you will be revealing sensitive information to the consultant.
D: you only need to obtain permission from the client if the consultant is not part of the same organization.
E: you must obtain permission from the client only if you will be revealing the client's identity to the consultant.
F: you can consult with a colleague without client's permission only if it's an emergency situation.
G: "you do not have to obtain permission from the client under any circumstances since the consultant is “clearly connected"" with the case."
H: you don't have to obtain permission from the client as long as he/she has already signed a general waiver.
I: you should discuss the matter with the client but the final decision is up to the professional's discretion.
J: you don't need to obtain permission if the consultation is about a general aspect of the case and not about the client specifically.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this multiple-choice question about ethics in psychology, specifically regarding consulting with a colleague. The question is asking what the APA’s Ethics Code and the Canadian Code of Ethics say about obtaining permission from a client before discussing their case with a colleague. 

First, I remember that when psychologists consult with colleagues, they have to consider confidentiality and informed consent. The client's right to privacy is important, so they should generally be informed and give consent before their information is shared, unless certain exceptions apply.

Looking at the options:

Option A says you should get permission from both the client and the consultant. That sounds a bit broad. I'm not sure if both are needed, but the client's permission is definitely key.

Option B states you must always get permission from the client. The word "always" makes me think this might not be correct because there could be exceptions, like emergencies or when a colleague is part of the same team.

Option C mentions obtaining permission only if revealing sensitive info. So if the info isn't sensitive, maybe you don't need permission. That could be a possibility, but I'm not certain.

Option D says you only need permission if the consultant isn't part of the same organization. I'm not sure about that. Maybe if they're part of the same team, there's implied consent, but I'm not sure if that's the case under the ethics codes.

Option E is about revealing the client's identity. So if you don't reveal their identity, maybe you don't need permission. But in a consultation, you often have to mention the client's case, which might include some identifying details.

Option F allows consulting without permission only in emergencies. That makes sense because emergencies often override usual procedures to act quickly, but it's a specific case, not the general rule.

Option G claims you don't need permission under any circumstances if the consultant is "clearly connected." I'm not sure what "clearly connected" means exactly, but this seems too broad. It might refer to when the consultant is part of the same treatment team, but I think you might still need some form of consent.

Option H suggests no need for permission if the client has signed a general waiver. That could be true, but a general waiver might not cover specific consultations, so this might not always apply.

Option I says you should discuss with the client, but the decision is up to the professional. This implies informed consent, which is important, but the final decision isn't entirely up to the client; the psychologist has to make professional judgments.

Option J states you don't need permission if it's about a general aspect and not specific to the client. This seems plausible. If the consultation is about general treatment approaches without revealing client details, maybe permission isn't needed.

Now, recalling the APA Ethics Code, I think that under certain conditions, like when consulting with another psychologist who is part of the treatment team, you don't necessarily need the client's permission if the information isn't sensitive or if it's for the purpose of treatment. But if the consultation involves discussing specific client information, especially sensitive details, then permission is required.

The Canadian Code of Ethics likely aligns with this, emphasizing client confidentiality. So, if the consultation is about a general aspect of the case without revealing specific client information, the psychologist might not need explicit permission. 

Looking back at the options, J seems to fit because it talks about a general aspect, not specific client info. So the answer would be J.

The correct answer is J: you don't need to obtain permission if the consultation is about a general aspect of the case and not about the client specifically.

Answer: J
