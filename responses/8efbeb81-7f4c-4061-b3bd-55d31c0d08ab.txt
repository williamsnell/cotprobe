Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about auditing ethics. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is asking which situation would NOT impair objectivity, integrity, or independence with respect to an audit client. The options are A through J.

First, I remember that auditors need to maintain independence, objectivity, and integrity to ensure that their audits are unbiased and reliable. Any situation that creates a conflict of interest or might influence their judgment could impair these principles.

Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: An auditor's son is offered an internship at the client's company. Hmm, this could be a problem. If the auditor's child is getting an internship, the auditor might feel pressured to make the client look good to help their son's chances. So this could impair independence.

Option B: An auditor invests a significant amount of money in the client's company. Oh, that's definitely a conflict. If the auditor has a financial interest in the client, their judgment could be biased because their investment's value depends on the client's financial health. So this would impair independence.

Option C: An out-of-town client takes the audit engagement team out to dinner at a renowned local restaurant. Dinners are pretty common in business settings. I think this is usually allowed as long as it's not extravagant. The rules might allow for reasonable meals. So this might not impair objectivity.

Option D: A client offers the audit team a company retreat to a luxury island. That sounds like a very expensive and luxurious offer. This could be seen as trying to influence the audit team, so it would impair independence.

Option E: An auditor provides client management with box seats for the season at a major league baseball franchise. Providing such perks could create a quid pro quo situation, where the client expects favorable treatment in the audit. So this would impair independence.

Option F: The audit team members are given a significant discount on the client's products. Discounts can be tricky. If they're significant, it might create a financial dependency or expectation, which could affect objectivity.

Option G: A client provides the audit engagement team with front-row concert tickets. Concert tickets could be seen as a bribe, especially if they're expensive. This would likely impair independence.

Option H: An auditor gifts the client's CFO a luxury car. Wow, that's a huge gift. This would definitely create a conflict of interest and impair independence.

Option I: An auditor takes the client’s audit committee to Las Vegas for the weekend. Traveling to a place known for entertainment could create an environment where the auditor's judgment is compromised. This would impair independence.

Option J: A client takes the audit engagement team on a two-day ski trip after the audit team worked for two consecutive weekends. Ski trips are a form of entertainment, and if it's a paid trip, it could be seen as trying to influence the audit. This might impair independence.

Now, which of these would NOT impair? From what I remember, the rules allow for occasional meals, especially when the client is out of town and it's a gesture of hospitality. So option C seems like it wouldn't impair because it's a dinner, which is a common courtesy and not overly extravagant. The others involve more significant gifts, discounts, or trips that could create a conflict.

The correct answer is C. Providing a meal, especially in an out-of-town context, is generally considered a reasonable gesture of hospitality and does not typically impair an auditor's independence, objectivity, or integrity. The other options involve more substantial gifts, discounts, or trips that could create conflicts of interest.

Answer: C
