Okay, so I've got this problem here about passing an algebra test at Academic Academy. The requirement is to score at least 80%, and there are 35 problems on the test. The question is asking for the greatest number of problems I can miss and still pass. The options are from A to J, each with a different number.

First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It's about figuring out the maximum number of questions I can get wrong while still achieving an 80% score. So, I can't miss more than that number without failing.

Let me break it down. The test has 35 problems, and I need to get at least 80% correct. To find out how many questions that is, I should calculate 80% of 35. 

So, 80% as a decimal is 0.8. I'll multiply that by 35. Let me do that calculation: 0.8 * 35. Hmm, 0.8 times 30 is 24, and 0.8 times 5 is 4, so adding those together gives 28. So, I need to get at least 28 questions right to pass.

Wait, but the question is about how many I can miss, not how many I need to get right. So, if I can get 28 right, how many can I miss? Since the test has 35 problems, I subtract the number I can get right from the total number of problems. That would be 35 - 28 = 7. So, I can miss up to 7 questions and still pass.

Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 80% of 35 is indeed 28, because 35 * 0.8 is 28. And 35 minus 28 is 7. So, missing 7 would mean getting 28 right, which is exactly 80%. That makes sense because if I miss more than 7, like 8, then I would have only 27 right, which is less than 80%, so I wouldn't pass.

Looking at the options, option B is 7. That must be the correct answer.

To determine the maximum number of problems you can miss and still pass, calculate 80% of 35, which is 28. Subtracting this from 35 gives 7. Therefore, the greatest number you can miss is 7.

Answer: B
