Okay, so I need to figure out how much the coat costs in December after the price markdowns. Let's break it down step by step.

The original price is $325.00. First, during November, it didn't sell, so the merchant marked it down by 20%. Then in December, there's an additional 10% discount. I need to calculate the final price after both discounts.

Wait, how do discounts stack? Is the second discount applied to the original price or the already discounted price from November? I think it's the latter because usually, subsequent discounts are applied after the first one. So first, I'll calculate the November discount.

20% off of $325.00. To find 20% of 325, I can multiply 325 by 0.20. Let's see, 325 * 0.20 = $65. So the price after November's discount is 325 - 65 = $260.00.

Now, in December, there's an additional 10% discount. But this 10% is on the new price, which is $260. So I need to calculate 10% of 260. 260 * 0.10 = $26. So subtracting that from $260 gives 260 - 26 = $234.00.

Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, I could think of it as multiplying the original price by the discount factors. First, a 20% discount is the same as 80% of the original price, so 325 * 0.80 = 260. Then, a 10% discount is 90% of that, so 260 * 0.90 = 234. Yep, that's the same as before.

Looking at the options, I see option G is $234.00. So that should be the correct answer.

The coat's price after November's 20% discount is $260. Applying December's 10% discount brings it down to $234.00.
