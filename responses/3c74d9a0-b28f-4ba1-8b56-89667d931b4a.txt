Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about psychology concepts, specifically about learned helplessness. I'm a bit rusty on my psychology terms, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question is: "Learned helplessness is an example of the power of..." and the options are from A to J. Let me recall what learned helplessness is. From what I remember, it's a concept where an organism (like a person or animal) learns to feel unable to avoid a negative situation. This usually happens after experiencing a situation where they can't control the outcome, even when opportunities to escape or change the situation arise later.

Let me think about the origins. I think this was studied by Martin Seligman and Steve Maier in the 1960s. They did experiments with dogs, where the dogs were exposed to shocks that they couldn't escape. Later, when given the chance to escape, they didn't because they had learned that they couldn't control the situation. So, it's about the learned behavior of helplessness.

Now, looking at the options, I need to figure out which psychological concept this relates to. Let's go through each option:

A: Cognitive dissonance – That's about holding conflicting cognitions and the discomfort that results, leading to behavior change to reduce the dissonance. Doesn't seem related to learned helplessness.

B: Positive reinforcement – This is when a behavior is strengthened by the addition of a positive stimulus. Learned helplessness isn't about reinforcing positive behaviors; it's about the lack of control leading to helplessness.

C: Classical conditioning – This involves learning through association, like Pavlov's dogs. Learned helplessness isn't really about associating two stimuli, though there might be some associative elements, but I don't think it's the primary concept here.

D: Intrinsic motivation – This is about doing something because it's inherently rewarding, not for external rewards. Learned helplessness isn't about motivation per se but about the absence of it due to perceived inability.

E: Observational learning – This is learning by watching others. While dogs in the experiment didn't observe others, the concept here is more about direct experience than observation.

F: Modeling – Similar to observational learning, modeling involves copying the behavior of others. Again, not directly related to learned helplessness.

G: Expectation – This is about anticipating outcomes. Learned helplessness might involve expectations of failure, but the primary concept is the learned behavior of helplessness.

H: Operant conditioning – This involves learning through rewards and punishments. Operant conditioning is about how behaviors are shaped by their consequences. I think learned helplessness might relate here because the dogs learned that their actions didn't lead to avoiding shocks, so they stopped trying. But wait, classical conditioning is more about stimulus-response, while operant is about behavior-consequence.

I: Negative reinforcement – This is when a behavior is strengthened by the removal of an aversive stimulus. If the dogs learned that their actions could remove the shock, that would be negative reinforcement, but in learned helplessness, they couldn't control the shocks, so it's more about the lack of reinforcement leading to helplessness.

J: Social learning – This involves learning by observing others in a social context. Again, not directly about learned helplessness.

Wait, so which is it between classical conditioning and operant conditioning? Let me think again. In the experiments, the dogs were given shocks and couldn't escape. The first phase was classical conditioning, where they learned to associate the stimulus with the shock. But the learned helplessness comes from the operant conditioning part, where they tried to escape but couldn't, so their behavior was not reinforced. They learned that their responses didn't matter, leading to helplessness.

So, learned helplessness is an example of the power of operant conditioning because it's about the effects of the absence of reinforcement. When the dogs couldn't escape, their attempts weren't reinforced, so they stopped trying, leading to helplessness.

Therefore, the answer should be H: operant conditioning.

Learned helplessness, as studied by Seligman and Maier, occurs when an organism learns to feel unable to avoid negative outcomes after repeated exposure to uncontrollable aversive stimuli. This concept is best explained through the lens of operant conditioning, where the absence of reinforcement (i.e., the inability to escape or control the situation) leads to the learned behavior of helplessness.

Answer: H
