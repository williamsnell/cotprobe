Okay, so I have this double integral problem to solve. The integral is ∬_S y dx dy, where y > 0, and S is a semicircle with diameter 1, centered at point C(1/2, 0), lying above the x-axis. I need to calculate this using polar coordinates and choose the correct answer from options A to J.

First, let me visualize the region S. It's a semicircle above the x-axis with diameter 1. The center is at (1/2, 0), so the semicircle goes from x=0 to x=1 on the x-axis, and the radius is half the diameter, which is 1/2.

Since we're dealing with a semicircle, polar coordinates might simplify the integration. But before jumping into that, I should set up the integral properly.

In Cartesian coordinates, the integral is ∫∫ y dx dy over the semicircle S. To set up the limits, I need to express the region S in terms of x and y. The semicircle equation can be written as (x - 1/2)^2 + y^2 = (1/2)^2, since the center is at (1/2, 0) and radius 1/2. Solving for y, we get y = sqrt[(1/2)^2 - (x - 1/2)^2].

So, in Cartesian, the integral would be from x=0 to x=1, and for each x, y goes from 0 to sqrt[(1/2)^2 - (x - 1/2)^2]. But integrating in Cartesian might be a bit messy because of the square roots and the limits. So, switching to polar coordinates could make this easier.

In polar coordinates, any point is represented as (r, θ), where r is the radius and θ is the angle. The transformation equations are x = r cosθ and y = r sinθ. The Jacobian determinant for the transformation is r, so dx dy becomes r dr dθ.

So, the integral becomes ∫∫ (r sinθ) * r dr dθ = ∫∫ r^2 sinθ dr dθ. Now I need to determine the limits for r and θ in this region.

The semicircle is centered at (1/2, 0) with radius 1/2. To express this in polar coordinates, I might need to adjust the equations. Let me think about the equation of the circle in polar form. The general equation for a circle in polar coordinates with center at (a, 0) and radius a is r = 2a cosθ. Wait, no, that's for a circle centered at (a,0) with radius a. Let me check: yes, for a circle centered at (a,0) with radius a, the polar equation is r = 2a cosθ. But in our case, the center is at (1/2, 0) and radius is 1/2. So substituting a=1/2, the polar equation becomes r = 2*(1/2) cosθ = cosθ.

So the boundary of the semicircle is r = cosθ. But since we're dealing with the upper semicircle (y > 0), θ will range from -π/2 to π/2 because the circle is centered on the x-axis. However, because y is positive, θ should be from 0 to π, but wait, that might not be the case because the circle is only the upper half above the x-axis.

Wait, no. The circle is a semicircle above the x-axis, so θ ranges from 0 to π. But wait, when θ is 0, r = 1 (since cos0=1), but our radius is 1/2. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should derive the polar equation correctly. The center is at (1/2, 0), so in polar coordinates, that point is (r=1/2, θ=0). The general equation for a circle in polar coordinates with center at (r0, 0) is r^2 - 2 r r0 cosθ + r0^2 = a^2, where a is the radius. In our case, r0 = 1/2 and a = 1/2. So substituting, we get:

r^2 - 2 * r * (1/2) cosθ + (1/2)^2 = (1/2)^2

Simplifying: r^2 - r cosθ + 1/4 = 1/4

So, r^2 - r cosθ = 0 → r(r - cosθ) = 0. Thus, r = 0 or r = cosθ. Since r=0 is just the origin, the circle is r = cosθ. So yes, the polar equation is r = cosθ.

Now, the region S is the upper half of this circle, so θ goes from -π/2 to π/2 because for θ beyond that, cosθ becomes negative, which would place the point in other quadrants. Wait, but since we're considering y > 0, which is the upper half, θ should range from 0 to π. But wait, when θ is beyond π/2, cosθ becomes negative, but our circle is only in the right half (since it's centered at (1/2,0)). So perhaps θ ranges from -π/2 to π/2, but since y > 0, we can adjust that.

Wait, no, because in polar coordinates, θ is measured from the positive x-axis. So for the semicircle above the x-axis, θ goes from 0 to π. But our circle is only from x=0 to x=1, so when θ is between 0 and π/2, r goes from 0 to cosθ. But when θ is between π/2 and π, cosθ becomes negative, but r can't be negative. So actually, the region is only for θ where cosθ is positive, which is from -π/2 to π/2. But since y > 0, θ must be in [0, π]. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should sketch the region. The semicircle is centered at (1/2, 0) with radius 1/2, so it touches the origin (0,0) and the point (1,0). The top of the circle is at (1/2, 1/2). So in polar coordinates, when θ is 0, r = cos0 = 1, which is the point (1,0). As θ increases, r decreases. At θ = π/3, cosθ = 0.5, so r=0.5. At θ = π/2, cosθ=0, so r=0, which is the origin. Wait, that can't be right because the circle should extend from (0,0) to (1,0). So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the limits.

Wait, when θ=0, r=1, which is point (1,0). As θ increases, r decreases until θ=π/2, where r=0, which is the origin. But our circle is only the upper half, so for each θ from 0 to π, but since the circle is only the right half, perhaps θ ranges from -π/2 to π/2, but with y>0, so θ from 0 to π/2 and then from π to 3π/2? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. The circle is from x=0 to x=1, centered at (1/2,0). In polar coordinates, for each θ, r goes from 0 to cosθ, but this only applies when cosθ is positive, which is from θ=-π/2 to θ=π/2. But since we're considering y>0, θ should be from 0 to π. So perhaps the region is θ from 0 to π/2, where cosθ is positive, and r from 0 to cosθ. But wait, when θ is between π/2 and π, cosθ is negative, so r would be negative, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the region is only θ from -π/2 to π/2, but with y>0, so θ from 0 to π/2.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should proceed differently. Let me set up the integral in polar coordinates. The integral becomes ∫(θ from a to b) ∫(r from 0 to cosθ) (r sinθ) * r dr dθ.

Wait, earlier I thought the integral is ∫∫ r^2 sinθ dr dθ, but actually, y = r sinθ, and dx dy = r dr dθ, so the integrand is y * dx dy = (r sinθ) * r dr dθ = r^2 sinθ dr dθ.

So the integral is ∫∫ r^2 sinθ dr dθ.

Now, I need to find the limits for r and θ. Since the region is the semicircle above the x-axis, and the circle is r = cosθ, which is valid for θ between -π/2 to π/2 because beyond that, cosθ is negative and r would be negative, which isn't part of our region.

But since y > 0, θ should be from 0 to π/2, because in that range, sinθ is positive, and r = cosθ is positive. Wait, but when θ is in π/2 to π, cosθ is negative, but our circle doesn't extend there because r can't be negative. So perhaps the limits are θ from -π/2 to π/2, but for y > 0, θ is from 0 to π/2.

Wait, no, because when θ is in -π/2 to 0, y is negative, which we don't want. So for y > 0, θ must be from 0 to π/2, and r from 0 to cosθ.

Wait, but when θ is beyond π/2, cosθ becomes negative, but our region doesn't exist there because r can't be negative. So the limits are θ from 0 to π/2, and r from 0 to cosθ.

So the integral becomes:

Integral from θ=0 to θ=π/2 of [Integral from r=0 to r=cosθ of r^2 sinθ dr] dθ.

Let me compute the inner integral first: ∫ r^2 dr from 0 to cosθ.

The integral of r^2 dr is (r^3)/3 evaluated from 0 to cosθ, which is (cos^3θ)/3.

Now, multiply by sinθ, so the inner integral becomes (cos^3θ)/3 * sinθ.

So the entire integral is ∫ from 0 to π/2 of (cos^3θ * sinθ)/3 dθ.

I can factor out the 1/3, so it's (1/3) ∫ cos^3θ sinθ dθ from 0 to π/2.

Let me make a substitution. Let u = cosθ, then du = -sinθ dθ.

When θ=0, u=1; θ=π/2, u=0.

So the integral becomes (1/3) ∫ u^3 (-du) from 1 to 0.

Which is (1/3) ∫ from 1 to 0 of u^3 (-du) → (1/3) ∫ from 0 to 1 of u^3 du.

Because flipping the limits removes the negative sign.

So ∫ u^3 du from 0 to 1 is [u^4/4] from 0 to 1 = 1/4 - 0 = 1/4.

Multiply by 1/3: (1/3)*(1/4) = 1/12 ≈ 0.0833.

Wait, but looking at the options, G is 0.0833, which is 1/12.

But wait, let me double-check the limits. Did I correctly set θ from 0 to π/2?

Yes, because for y > 0, θ is between 0 and π/2, and r goes from 0 to cosθ.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the entire semicircle. Wait, the region S is a semicircle above the x-axis, but in polar coordinates, the equation r = cosθ covers the entire circle, including the lower half when θ is negative. But since we're considering y > 0, we only take θ from 0 to π/2.

Wait, another approach: sometimes it's easier to shift the origin to the center of the circle when integrating. Let me try that.

If I shift the origin to point C(1/2, 0), then the semicircle becomes centered at (0,0) with radius 1/2. But I'm not sure if that helps because the integration in polar coordinates might complicate things more. Alternatively, perhaps I can use symmetry or other methods.

Wait, but my previous calculation gave me 1/12, which is option G. However, looking at the options, I also see option F is 0.25, which is 1/4, and others.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the limits. Let me think again. The semicircle is from x=0 to x=1, centered at (1/2,0). In polar coordinates, the equation is r = 2*(1/2) cosθ = cosθ, as I had before. So the region is all points where r ≤ cosθ, and θ from -π/2 to π/2. But since y > 0, θ is from 0 to π/2.

Wait, but when θ is π/2, cosθ is 0, so r=0, which is the origin. So the region is a quarter-circle? No, because the entire circle is r = cosθ, which is a full circle of radius 1/2 centered at (1/2,0). So the upper half (y>0) would be θ from 0 to π/2, as I had.

But let me think about the area. The area of the semicircle is (1/2)π*(1/2)^2 = π/8 ≈ 0.3927. The integral of y over this area would be something else.

Wait, but my calculation gave me 1/12 ≈ 0.0833, which is option G. But let me check another way. Maybe I should visualize the integral differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the integral in Cartesian coordinates to cross-verify.

In Cartesian, the integral is ∫ from x=0 to x=1 ∫ from y=0 to sqrt( (1/2)^2 - (x - 1/2)^2 ) of y dy dx.

First, integrate with respect to y: ∫ y dy from 0 to sqrt(...) is [ (1/2) y^2 ] evaluated at the limits, which is (1/2)( ( (1/2)^2 - (x - 1/2)^2 ) ).

So the inner integral becomes (1/2)( (1/4) - (x - 1/2)^2 ).

Now, the integral becomes ∫ from x=0 to x=1 of (1/2)(1/4 - (x - 1/2)^2 ) dx.

Simplify: (1/2) ∫ [1/4 - (x^2 - x + 1/4)] dx.

Wait, expanding (x - 1/2)^2: x^2 - x + 1/4.

So 1/4 - (x^2 - x + 1/4) = 1/4 - x^2 + x - 1/4 = -x^2 + x.

So the integral becomes (1/2) ∫ from 0 to 1 of (-x^2 + x) dx.

Compute the integral: ∫ (-x^2 + x) dx = [ -x^3/3 + x^2/2 ] from 0 to 1.

At x=1: -1/3 + 1/2 = ( -2/6 + 3/6 ) = 1/6.

Multiply by (1/2): (1/2)*(1/6) = 1/12 ≈ 0.0833.

So both methods give the same result, 1/12, which is option G.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the area is π/8, which is about 0.3927, and the integral of y over that area being 1/12 seems small, but it's correct because y is being integrated, not 1. Alternatively, let me compute the average value of y over the semicircle and multiply by the area. The average value would be (1/12) / (π/8) ) = (1/12)*(8/π) )= 2/(3π) ≈ 0.212, which seems plausible.

So I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer should be G: 0.0833.

The problem involves calculating the double integral ∬_S y dx dy over a semicircle of diameter 1 centered at (1/2, 0) above the x-axis. To simplify the integration, polar coordinates are used. The semicircle's equation in polar form is r = cosθ, valid for θ between 0 and π/2 since y > 0. The integral is transformed into polar coordinates as ∫∫ r^2 sinθ dr dθ. Evaluating the inner integral with respect to r from 0 to cosθ yields (cos³θ)/3. Substituting into the outer integral and simplifying using u = cosθ, the integral evaluates to 1/12, corresponding to option G.

Answer: G
