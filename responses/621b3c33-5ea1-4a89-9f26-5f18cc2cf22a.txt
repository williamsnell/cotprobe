Question:

The pancreas secretes a large amount of digestive enzymes after a meal. Which statement about this process is correct?


Options:

A: Bile is needed to activate all pancreatic enzymes
B: All pancreatic enzymes are produced in an active form and can start digestion immediately
C: Enzymes are produced in the pancreas but released in the stomach for digestion
D: Pepsinogen is the chief enzyme which digests protein and requires removal of a peptide sequence from the active cleft before it can work
E: Pancreatic secretion of hydrochloric acid is required to provide the correct pH for maximal pancreatic enzyme in the duodenum
F: Enteropeptidase converts trypsinogen to trypsin by cleavage of a peptide sequence that blocks the active site of trypsin.
G: Pancreatic enzymes are needed to break down carbohydrates only.
H: Pancreatic รก-amylase will hydrolyse starch to free glucose

Okay, so I have this question about the pancreas and its digestive enzymes. Let me think through this step by step. 

The question is asking which statement is correct regarding the process where the pancreas secretes a lot of digestive enzymes after a meal. The options are A to H, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I'll go through each option one by one to evaluate their correctness.

Option A: Bile is needed to activate all pancreatic enzymes. Hmm, I remember that some enzymes like lipase require bile acids for proper function because bile emulsifies fats. But do all pancreatic enzymes need bile? I think not. For example, amylases and some proteases might not require bile. So A might not be correct.

Option B: All pancreatic enzymes are produced in an active form and can start digestion immediately. Wait, I recall that some enzymes are secreted in an inactive form, like trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen. They get activated once they reach the small intestine, usually by enterokinase and enteropeptidase. So B is incorrect because they're not all active upon secretion.

Option C: Enzymes are produced in the pancreas but released in the stomach for digestion. No, that's not right. Pancreatic enzymes are released into the duodenum, part of the small intestine, not the stomach. The stomach has its own environment with acid, which isn't suitable for these enzymes. So C is wrong.

Option D: Pepsinogen is the chief enzyme which digests protein and requires removal of a peptide sequence from the active cleft before it can work. Wait, pepsinogen is actually produced in the stomach, not the pancreas. The pancreas produces trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen. So D is incorrect because it's talking about pepsinogen, which isn't a pancreatic enzyme.

Option E: Pancreatic secretion of hydrochloric acid is required to provide the correct pH for maximal pancreatic enzyme in the duodenum. No, the pancreas doesn't secrete hydrochloric acid. That's the role of the stomach (gastric acid). The duodenum has a more neutral pH, which is suitable for pancreatic enzymes. So E is wrong.

Option F: Enteropeptidase converts trypsinogen to trypsin by cleavage of a peptide sequence that blocks the active site of trypsin. Yes, that sounds right. Enteropeptidase (also called enterokinase) activates trypsinogen by removing a specific peptide, which unblocks the active site, allowing trypsin to function. So F seems correct.

Option G: Pancreatic enzymes are needed to break down carbohydrates only. No, the pancreas secretes enzymes for proteins (like trypsin), fats (lipase), and carbohydrates (amylase). So G is incorrect.

Option H: Pancreatic รก-amylase will hydrolyse starch to free glucose. I think รก-amylase breaks down starch into smaller fragments like maltotriose and maltose, but not directly into glucose. The small intestine's brush border enzymes finish the job. So H is incorrect.

Putting it all together, the correct statement is F. It correctly describes the activation of trypsinogen by enteropeptidase.

The correct answer is F: Enteropeptidase converts trypsinogen to trypsin by cleavage of a peptide sequence that blocks the active site of trypsin.

Answer: F
