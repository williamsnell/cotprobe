The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

In a criminal prosecution the government must prove that the defendant affixed a rubber-stamp containing his signature to certain fraudulent letters mailed to the victim. The defendant denied that he stamped the letters. There were no witnesses to the defendant stamping the letters. The prosecution attempted to present a co-worker to testify that defendant maintained sole control of the stamp and used it once daily at 3 p.m. to sign all outgoing letters, and then immediately returned it to his safe. The co-worker would testify that he saw the defendant using the stamp in that habitual manner over a period of many years. The defense objected because this did not prove that the defendant's practice was followed on the dates in question. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, what will the court rule?

Options:

A: The testimony is inadmissible because evidence of prior habit will only distract the jury from deciding whether the defendant actually acted that way on the specified dates.
B: The testimony is inadmissible because it is not direct evidence that the defendant used the stamp on the fraudulent letters.
C: The testimony is inadmissible because the co-worker does not have a direct knowledge of the defendant using the stamp on the fraudulent letters.
D: The testimony is inadmissible because evidence of habit is not admissible in a criminal case under the Federal Rules of Evidence.
E: The testimony is admissible because it proves that the defendant had access to the stamp.
F: The testimony is admissible because it proves a pattern of behavior that the defendant maintained control over the stamp.
G: The testimony is admissible because it proves that the defendant was the only person who could have used the stamp.
H: The testimony is inadmissible because the co-worker's observation is considered hearsay under the Federal Rules of Evidence.
I: The testimony is admissible because habit and routine practice are admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence.
J: The testimony is admissible because it provides the jury with information about the defendant's routine, which is relevant to the case.

Okay, so I've got this evidence question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's break it down step by step. The question is about whether certain testimony is admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence.

Alright, the scenario: In a criminal prosecution, the government needs to prove that the defendant affixed a rubber stamp with his signature to fraudulent letters that were mailed to the victim. The defendant denies doing this, and there are no witnesses to the act. So the prosecution is trying to bring in a co-worker who will testify about the defendant's routine with the stamp.

The co-worker would say that the defendant maintained sole control of the stamp and used it once daily at 3 p.m. to sign all outgoing letters, then put it back in his safe. The co-worker observed this habit over many years. The defense is objecting because this doesn't prove that the defendant actually used the stamp on the specific dates in question.

So the issue here is about the admissibility of habit evidence. I remember that under the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically FRE 406, evidence of a person's habit is admissible to prove that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the habit. But there are some conditions. For example, the habit must be shown by specific instances of conduct unless the time or circumstances make it highly probable that the person did the act.

Wait, but isn't there a rule against using habit evidence to prove action on a specific occasion unless it's a routine that's so ingrained that it's almost automatic? Or is it more about whether the evidence is being used for its tendency to show behavior on that occasion?

In this case, the co-worker is testifying about a long-standing habit of the defendant using the stamp every day at 3 p.m. and returning it. The defense is arguing that this doesn't prove he used it on the specific dates when the fraudulent letters were sent.

I think the key here is that evidence of a habit (like using the stamp daily at 3 p.m.) can be used to show that the person acted in accordance with that habit on a particular occasion. So if the letters were mailed on dates when this daily routine would have occurred, the habit could support that the defendant used the stamp then.

But wait, the objection was that it doesn't prove the practice was followed on the dates in question. So the court would have to determine if the evidence is sufficient to show the habit was followed on those dates. If the co-worker can testify to the habit, then under FRE 406, it's admissible because it's about routine practice, which can be used to show conduct on a particular occasion.

Looking at the options:

Option I says the testimony is admissible because habit and routine are admissible. That seems correct under FRE 406. But wait, sometimes courts require that the habit be so regular that the probability is high the person acted in accordance with it on the specific occasion. If the co-worker can establish that the defendant used the stamp every day at 3 p.m., then it's a strong routine, making it likely he did so on the specific dates.

But could there be an issue with the foundation? Like, does the co-worker's testimony about the habit meet the requirements? FRE 406 allows proving habit by specific instances unless it's a routine so that the person's conduct on the occasion was probably in accordance with it. So the proponent needs to lay a foundation by showing the habit's existence and regularity.

If the co-worker can testify that over many years, the defendant used the stamp daily at 3 p.m., then that establishes a habit. The testimony would be admissible to show that on the specific dates in question, the defendant likely used the stamp as part of his routine.

Now looking at the options again:

Option I: Admissible because habit and routine are allowed. That seems correct.

But wait, another angle: The defense argues that the evidence doesn't prove the defendant's practice on the dates in question. But under 406, the evidence of habit is admissible to prove conduct on a specific occasion when the habit is established. So the testimony is allowed for that purpose.

So the correct ruling would be that the testimony is admissible under FRE 406. So the answer should be I.

Wait, but let me check the other options to make sure.

Option F says it's admissible because it proves a pattern of behavior that the defendant maintained control. That's partially true, but the main reason under FRE is about habit allowing proof of conduct on a particular occasion.

Option E says it's admissible because it proves access, but that's not the main point here. The issue is about whether he used it on specific dates, not just that he had access.

Option G says it's about exclusive control, which might go to whether someone else couldn't have done it, but the main issue is the habit evidence.

So I think the correct answer is I: admissible because habit and routine are admissible under FRE.

The testimony is admissible because habit and routine practice are admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence to prove that the defendant acted in accordance with his established habit on the specific dates in question.

Answer: I
