Okay, so I have this physics problem here about measuring the energy of an electron. The question is asking how long it would take to measure the energy to a precision of 1 percent, given that the energy is approximately 1 × 10^-18 J. The options are from A to J, each with different time values.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with precision in measurements, especially in quantum mechanics, there's something called the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. I think it relates the uncertainty in energy and the time it takes to measure. The principle states that you can't simultaneously know both the energy and the time with high precision. The more precisely you measure the energy, the less you know about the time, or vice versa.

The formula I recall is ΔE × Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, Δt is the time uncertainty, and ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh wait, but sometimes it's written as ΔE × Δt ≈ ħ, depending on the source. I think the exact coefficient can vary, but the order of magnitude should be the same.

So let's break it down. The energy is 1e-18 J, and we need 1% precision. That means the uncertainty ΔE is 1% of 1e-18 J, which is 0.01 × 1e-18 = 1e-20 J.

Now, using the uncertainty principle: ΔE × Δt ≈ ħ. I need to remember the value of ħ. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 × 10^-34 J·s, so ħ is h divided by 2π, which is roughly 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s.

So rearranging the formula to solve for Δt: Δt ≈ ħ / ΔE.

Plugging in the numbers: ħ is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s, and ΔE is 1e-20 J.

Let me calculate that: 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-20 = 1.0545718e-14 seconds.

Wait, but wait a second. Some sources might use a factor of π/2 or something similar, but I think the standard approximation is to use ħ ≈ 1e-34 J·s. So maybe I should just go with the calculation.

Looking at the options, I need to see which one is closest to 1e-14 seconds. Let me check the options:

E is 1.6e-14 s, G is 1.1e-14 s, etc. Wait, but my calculation gave me about 1.05e-14 s, which is approximately 1e-14 s. But none of the options exactly match that. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation or the formula?

Wait, wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula. Another version I've seen is ΔE × Δt ≥ ħ/2. So using ħ/2 would give a smaller Δt.

Let me recalculate with ħ/2. So ħ is ~1.05e-34, so ħ/2 is ~0.527e-34.

Then Δt = (0.527e-34) / (1e-20) = 0.527e-14 s, which is about 5.27e-15 s.

Looking at the options, option A is 5.3e-15 s, which is very close to this value. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but why did I get a different number before? Oh because I mixed up the version of the formula. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle can be written as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, so the minimum uncertainty is ħ/(2ΔE). So in that case, Δt is approximately ħ/(2ΔE).

So using that, I get Δt ≈ (1.05e-34) / (2 * 1e-20) ) = 5.25e-15 seconds. Which is about 5.3e-15 s, matching option A.

So the correct answer should be option A.

The problem involves determining the time required to measure the energy of an electron with 1% precision using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The energy of the electron is given as \(1 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}\), and the uncertainty in energy (\(\Delta E\)) is 1% of this value, which is \(1 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}\). The uncertainty principle states that \(\Delta E \times \Delta t \approx \hbar / 2\), where \(\hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\). Solving for \(\Delta t\) gives:

\[
\Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta E} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 1 \times 10^{-20}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}.
\]

This value closely matches option A (\(5.3 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}\)). Therefore, the correct answer is:

A
