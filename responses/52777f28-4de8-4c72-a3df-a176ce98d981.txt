Okay, so I have this question about cross-cultural facial expressions, and I need to figure out which option correctly lists the six universally recognized expressions. I remember something about this from psychology class. I think it's called the Ekman's theory or something like that. Paul Ekman, right? He did a lot of research on facial expressions and emotions.

From what I recall, Ekman found that there are six basic emotions that are recognized across different cultures. The key here is that these emotions are universal, meaning people from various backgrounds can interpret them the same way based on facial expressions. So the question is asking which option lists these six correctly.

Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A: Happiness, sadness, desire, repulsion, fear, and surprise. Wait, desire and repulsion are both related to wanting or not wanting something, but I'm not sure if those are considered basic emotions in this context. I think the more commonly cited ones are happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, and maybe disgust.

Option B: Joy, sorrow, fear, rage, astonishment, and repugnance. These seem similar to some basic emotions but maybe not exactly the standard ones. For example, astonishment might be part of surprise, but I'm not sure if that's the exact term used.

Option C: Happiness, sadness, anger, loathing, lust, and surprise. Lust and loathing don't sound like the standard ones. I think lust isn't typically included in the basic emotions list. The standard ones are more about survival responses, like fear and anger.

Option D: Elation, melancholy, panic, ire, stupefaction, and detestation. These terms are more specific or intense. Elation is like happiness, but panic is more than fear. Not sure if these are the standard ones.

Option E: Glee, gloom, terror, outrage, amazement, and abhorrence. Again, these seem a bit more intense or specific. Terror is a form of fear, but I'm not sure if outrage is the same as anger in this context.

Option F: Happiness, sadness, fright, anger, shock, and revulsion. Fright is fear, anger is anger, revulsion is disgust. Shock might be part of surprise, but I'm not sure if that's the exact term. Wait, the standard list includes surprise, so "shock" might not be the right term here.

Option G: Happiness, sadness, indifference, fright, surprise, and dislike. Indifference isn't one of the basic emotions I remember. It's more about neutrality, not a core emotion.

Option H: Delight, despair, dread, fury, wonder, and aversion. Delight is happiness, despair is sadness, dread is fear, fury is anger, wonder might be surprise, and aversion is disgust. This seems close, but I'm not sure if "wonder" is the standard term.

Option I: Happiness, sadness, fear, wrath, startle, and repulse. Wrath is anger, startle is a quick reaction to fear, and repulse is disgust. But I'm not sure if "startle" is considered a basic emotion on its own.

Option J: Happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, and disgust. This looks familiar. I think Ekman's original list includes these six: happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, and disgust. Let me double-check the terms. Yes, that's right. So option J must be the correct answer.
