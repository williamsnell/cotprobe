Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this problem about removing water from an air-water mixture. Hmm, the mixture is 35% water by volume, which means that in the mixture, water takes up 35% of the volume. The problem says the mixture diffuses into a section of still air that's 0.2 inches long, and then the water is absorbed, so its concentration is negligible at that point. I need to find the rate at which water diffuses through this air layer.

The system operates at 1 atm and 59.0°C. So temperature is pretty warm, which might affect the diffusion rate because higher temperatures usually increase diffusion rates, right? But I'm not exactly sure how that factors into the calculations.

I remember that diffusion rates can be calculated using Fick's Law, which relates the molar flux to the concentration gradient and the diffusion coefficient. Fick's first law is J = -D * (dc/dx), where J is the molar flux, D is the diffusion coefficient, and dc/dx is the concentration gradient.

But wait, in this case, the setup is a bit different because the mixture is passing through a still air layer. So I think it's a case of convective mass transfer or maybe a boundary layer problem. Oh, wait, the mixture is moving, and the air is still? Or is the mixture diffusing into still air? The question says the mixture diffuses into a section of still air. So perhaps it's a case of laminar flow over a surface, and the absorption happens at the surface where the concentration becomes negligible.

Alternatively, maybe it's a simple case of using the formula for mass transfer through a stagnant layer, using the formula for the rate of mass transfer. I think the rate of mass transfer can be calculated using the formula: N = k * A * (C_in - C_out), where k is the mass transfer coefficient, A is the area, and the concentrations are in mole fraction terms.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the setup. Let me try to visualize it. There's an air-water mixture (35% water by volume) that's moving through a region of still air that's 0.2 inches long. So the water diffuses out of the mixture into this still air, and then is absorbed somewhere else. At the absorption plane, the concentration is negligible, meaning the concentration of water there is zero.

So maybe this is a case of a laminar boundary layer where the concentration gradient is set up across the 0.2 inches. So perhaps I can model this using Fick's law, considering the thickness of the air layer (0.2 inches) as the distance over which the concentration changes from the initial concentration to zero.

First, I need to find the concentration of water in the mixture. The mixture is 35% water by volume. Since it's a gas mixture, the partial molar volumes of each component should be considered, but I'm not sure if that's necessary here. Alternatively, since both air and water are gases, their concentrations can be considered in terms of mole fractions.

Wait, but wait, at 59°C and 1 atm, water might not be a gas? Wait, no, 1 atm is standard pressure, and 59°C is above the boiling point of water (which is 100°C at 1 atm), so water would be a gas here. Wait, no, wait, 59°C is lower than 100°C, so at 1 atm, water would be a liquid. Wait, no, no, at 1 atm, the boiling point is 100°C, so below that, water is a liquid. Wait, but if the system is at 59°C and 1 atm, then water is a liquid. Hmm, that complicates things because the mixture is an air-water vapor mixture, but if water is liquid, perhaps it's not a gas anymore. Wait, maybe the problem is considering the water as vapor, so perhaps it's an error, or maybe it's at a higher pressure where water can be a gas at 59°C. But the problem says 1 atm, so I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the water is in the vapor phase. Alternatively, maybe the system is at a higher temperature where water is vapor. Wait, no, 59°C is below 100°C, so at 1 atm, water is a liquid. Hmm, perhaps the problem is in error, or perhaps it's a typo. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this, and the problem is treating water as a gas regardless. I'll proceed under the assumption that the water is in the vapor phase, perhaps because the problem states it's a mixture, so maybe it's a gas-gas mixture, implying that water is a vapor.

So, the initial concentration of water is 35% by volume. Since it's a gas mixture, the mole fraction of water can be found using the ideal gas law, since at the same temperature and pressure, the volume fractions are proportional to mole fractions. So if the mixture is 35% water by volume, then the mole fraction of water, y1, is 0.35.

At the absorption plane (x = 0.2 inches), the concentration of water is negligible, so y2 ≈ 0. So the concentration gradient is from y1=0.35 to y2=0 over a distance L=0.2 inches.

Wait, but wait, the problem is asking for the rate of water diffusing through the air layer. So perhaps the approach is to calculate the molar flux at the surface, which would then be the rate per unit area.

Using Fick's first law, J = -D * (dy/dx). The negative sign indicates the direction of diffusion, which we're interested in the magnitude. So J is the molar flux (moles per area per time), D is the diffusion coefficient, and dy/dx is the concentration gradient.

So, dy/dx = (y2 - y1)/L = (0 - 0.35)/0.2 inches.

Wait, but I need to make sure about the units. Let's see: L is 0.2 inches. I'll need to convert that into feet because the answer options are in lb/mole/ft²·hr.

Wait, but let me think about the steps:

1. Find the mole fraction of water, y1 = 0.35.
2. The concentration at the other side, y2 = 0.
3. The distance, L = 0.2 inches = 0.2/12 feet = 0.016667 ft.
4. The concentration gradient, dy/dx = (0 - 0.35)/0.016667 ft = -21 mol/m³ (Wait, no, wait, perhaps I'm mixing units here).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the concentration in moles per cubic foot.

Wait, the concentration gradient is (y2 - y1)/L. But units need to be consistent.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the total molar concentration first. Using the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, so at 1 atm and 59°C, the molar concentration of the gas mixture is:

P = 1 atm = 14.7 psi absolute.
R = 10.73 psi·ft³/(lb·mol·°R) (I think this is the value for R when pressure is in psi and volume in ft³)
T = 59°C + 459.67 = 518.67 °R.

So, n = P/(RT) = 14.7 psi / (10.73 * 518.67) = let's calculate that.

10.73 * 518.67 ≈ 10.73 * 500 = 5365, plus 10.73*18.67≈199, so total ≈ 5564 psi·ft³/(lb·mol).

So n = 14.7 / 5564 ≈ 0.00264 lb·mol/ft³.

Wait, that seems low. Let me double-check the units.

Alternatively, R is sometimes given as 10.73 (ft³·psi)/(lb·mol·°R). So yes, the calculation seems correct.

So the total molar concentration of the mixture is 0.00264 lb·mol/ft³.

Since the mole fraction of water is 0.35, the concentration of water is y1 * n = 0.35 * 0.00264 ≈ 0.000924 lb·mol/ft³.

Wait, but that's the concentration at the beginning (x=0). At x=0.2 inches (0.016667 ft), the concentration is zero.

So the concentration gradient dy/dx is (0 - 0.000924) / 0.016667 ft ≈ -55.44 lb·mol/(ft²·ft) = -55.44 lb·mol/(ft³).

Wait, but perhaps I'm getting the units wrong. Let me think: dy/dx is (concentration change)/(distance). Concentration is in lb·mol/ft³, and distance is in ft. So dy/dx is (lb·mol/ft³)/ft = lb·mol/(ft⁴).

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should express the concentration gradient as (mole fraction per inch), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula for steady-state diffusion through a membrane or boundary layer. The flux J is given by J = (y1 * n) * D / L, where D is the diffusion coefficient.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for mass transfer coefficient, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe another approach is to find the diffusion coefficient D of water in air at the given conditions. The diffusion coefficient can be found using the Chapman-Enskog theory, which relates D to the temperature, pressure, and molecular properties of the gases involved.

The formula for the diffusion coefficient D is given by:

D = ( (k*T) / (π * d1^2 * P) ) * ln( (2 * (M1 + M2)) / (sqrt(M1*M2)) ) ) / sqrt(M1*M2)

Wait, no, perhaps the formula is:

D = ( (k*T) / (π * d^2) ) * ( ln( (2 (M1 + M2)) / sqrt(M1 M2) ) ) / sqrt(M1 M2) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, the diffusion coefficient can be expressed as:

D = ( ( (k_B * T) / ( π * d^2 * P) ) ) * f

where f is a factor based on the molecular weight and collision diameter.

But perhaps I should look up the formula. Alternatively, maybe I can use an empirical relation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for D in terms of temperature and pressure as:

D = ( (R*T) / (31.4 * P) ) * ( ln( (2 (M1 + M2)) / (sqrt(M1 M2)) ) ) / sqrt(M1 M2)

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for an approximate value for D at 1 atm and 59°C.

Wait, I think the diffusion coefficient for water vapor in air is about 0.2 cm²/s at 20°C and 1 atm. But since the temperature is higher, the diffusion coefficient increases. Let's see, perhaps I can estimate it.

The diffusion coefficient D is proportional to the square root of temperature, roughly. So if at 20°C (293 K) D is 0.2 cm²/s, then at 59°C (332 K), D would be sqrt(332/293) times larger. So sqrt(332/293) ≈ sqrt(1.133) ≈ 1.064. So D ≈ 0.2 * 1.064 ≈ 0.2128 cm²/s.

But wait, I'm not sure if this scaling is accurate. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for D in air for water vapor.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for D as:

D = ( ( (k_B * T) / ( π * d^2 * P) ) ) * ln( (2 (M1 + M2)) / sqrt(M1 M2) ) ) / sqrt(M1 M2)

Where:
- kB is Boltzmann's constant,
- T is absolute temperature,
- d is the collision diameter,
- P is pressure,
- M1 and M2 are molecular weights.

But this might get complicated. Let me try to find the values I need.

Molecular weight of air, M_air ≈ 28.97 lb/mol.
Molecular weight of water, M_water = 18.02 lb/mol.

The collision diameter for water in air, d, I think is about 3.5 Å (angstroms), which is 3.5e-8 cm. But I'm not sure; maybe it's 3.64 Å. Wait, I'm not certain.

But perhaps I can find an approximate D value. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula that D is proportional to (T)^(3/2) / (P * sqrt(M)), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for D in air for water vapor at 1 atm and 59°C. I found online that at 20°C, D is about 0.2 cm²/s. So at higher temperatures, it's higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the following formula:

D = ( (R*T) / (31.4 * P) ) * ( (28.97 + 18.02) / sqrt(28.97 * 18.02) )^{0.5} )

Wait, perhaps not. I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should proceed with an approximate value.

Let me proceed with D = 0.2 cm²/s at 20°C, and estimate it for 59°C. Since D increases with temperature, perhaps I'll take D ≈ 0.2 * (332/293)^(0.5) ≈ 0.2 * 1.064 ≈ 0.2128 cm²/s.

But I need to convert this into ft²/hour because the answer options are in lb/mole/ft²·hr.

Wait, 1 cm²/s is equal to (0.0328084 ft)^2 / (3600 s). So 0.2128 cm²/s = 0.2128 * (0.0328084)^2 / 3600 ft²/h.

Let me compute that:

0.0328084 ft = 1 cm, so (0.0328084)^2 ≈ 0.00107639 ft². So 0.2128 * 0.00107639 ≈ 0.0002288 cm²/s converted to ft²/s.

Wait, no, wait: 0.2128 cm²/s * (0.0328084 ft/cm)^2 = 0.2128 * 0.00107639 ft²/s ≈ 0.0002288 ft²/s.

Now, convert to ft²/hr by multiplying by 3600: 0.0002288 * 3600 ≈ 0.8237 ft²/hr.

Wait, that seems high. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in unit conversion.

Wait, 1 cm² = (0.01 m)^2 = 1e-4 m², but in ft, 1 cm is 0.0328084 ft, so 1 cm² = (0.0328084 ft)^2 ≈ 0.00107639 ft².

So 0.2128 cm²/s = 0.2128 * 0.00107639 ft²/s ≈ 0.0002288 ft²/s.

Convert to per hour: 0.0002288 * 3600 ≈ 0.8237 ft²/hr.

Hmm, that's the D in ft²/hr.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Maybe I should double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the value of D for water in air at 1 atm and 59°C. I found a source that says that at 25°C, D is about 0.2 cm²/s, so perhaps at 59°C, it's higher. Let's take D ≈ 0.23 cm²/s.

Wait, but regardless, I think I'm getting stuck on finding the correct D. Maybe I should proceed with the initial assumption and see where it leads.

So, D ≈ 0.2128 cm²/s ≈ 0.0002288 ft²/s ≈ 0.8237 ft²/hr.

Now, moving back to Fick's law: J = D * (y1 - y2)/L.

Wait, but wait, J is the molar flux, which is in moles per area per time. So J = (D * dy/dx).

dy/dx is the concentration gradient. Since y1 = 0.35 and y2 = 0, the change is 0.35 over a distance L = 0.2 inches = 0.016667 ft.

So dy/dx = (0.35 - 0) / 0.016667 ft ≈ 21.0 (unitless per ft).

Wait, no, because y is mole fraction, which is unitless, and L is in ft, so dy/dx is 21.0 (unitless) per ft.

So J = D * dy/dx = (0.8237 ft²/hr) * 21.0 (unitless)/ft = 0.8237 * 21 ≈ 17.2957 (unitless)/hr·ft.

Wait, that can't be right because the units don't match the answer options, which are in lb/mole/ft²·hr.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a step. The molar flux J is in moles per area per time, but I need to relate it to the concentration.

Wait, perhaps I should express J in terms of the concentration gradient and D.

Wait, another approach: The molar flux J is given by J = -D * (dy/dx), where dy is the change in mole fraction over distance dx.

In this case, dy = -0.35 (from y1=0.35 to y2=0) over dx = 0.016667 ft.

So dy/dx = (-0.35)/0.016667 ≈ -21 (unitless)/ft.

So J = D * |dy/dx| = D * 21.

But D is in ft²/hr, so J would be in (ft²/hr) * (1/ft) ) → ft/hr.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. I think I'm making a mistake in units.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the concentration gradient in terms of concentration per length.

Concentration is in lb·mol/ft³, and L is in ft, so dy/dx would be (lb·mol/ft³)/ft = lb·mol/(ft⁴).

Hmm, perhaps I should compute the concentration gradient more carefully.

The initial concentration of water is y1 = 0.35 (mole fraction) times the total concentration n, which is 0.00264 lb·mol/ft³.

So c1 = y1 * n = 0.35 * 0.00264 ≈ 0.000924 lb·mol/ft³.

At the end (x=0.016667 ft), c2 = 0.

So the concentration gradient dc/dx = (0 - 0.000924) / 0.016667 ≈ -55.44 lb·mol/(ft³·ft).

So dc/dx = -55.44 lb·mol/(ft⁴).

Now, using Fick's law: J = -D * (dc/dx).

So J = D * 55.44 lb·mol/(ft⁴).

Wait, but D is in ft²/hr, so J would be:

D (ft²/hr) * 55.44 (lb·mol/(ft⁴)) → (ft²/hr) * (lb·mol/ft⁴) ) = (lb·mol)/(ft²·hr).

Ah, that makes sense. So J = D * 55.44.

Wait, no: J = D * (dc/dx). So J = D * (55.44 lb·mol/(ft⁴)).

Wait, but D is in ft²/hr, so J = (ft²/hr) * (lb·mol/ft⁴) ) → lb·mol/(ft²·hr), which matches the answer options.

So J = D * 55.44.

But wait, D is 0.8237 ft²/hr, so J = 0.8237 * 55.44 ≈ 45.67 lb·mol/(ft²·hr).

Wait, that's way higher than any of the options, which are around 0.07 to 0.13 lb/mole/ft²·hr. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Hmm, let's go back and check the steps.

First, the calculation of the total molar concentration n. I used n = P/(RT) with R=10.73 psi·ft³/(lb·mol·°R). P is 14.7 psi, T is 59°C + 459.67 = 518.67 °R.

So n = 14.7 / (10.73 * 518.67).

Compute denominator: 10.73 * 518.67 ≈ 10.73 * 500 ≈ 5365 plus 10.73*18.67 ≈ 200, so total ≈ 5565.

n ≈ 14.7 / 5565 ≈ 0.00264 lb·mol/ft³. That seems correct.

Then, c1 = y1 * n = 0.35 * 0.00264 ≈ 0.000924 lb·mol/ft³.

Then, dc/dx = (0 - 0.000924) / 0.016667 ft = -55.44 lb·mol/(ft³·ft) = -55.44 lb·mol/(ft⁴).

So Fick's law: J = D * (dc/dx) → D is in ft²/hr.

Wait, but I think I messed up the units for D. Because when I calculated D earlier, I got 0.8237 ft²/hr, but maybe that's incorrect.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation for D.

I estimated D at 59°C as approximately 0.2128 cm²/s. To convert cm²/s to ft²/hr:

1 cm = 0.0328084 ft → 1 cm² = (0.0328084)^2 ft² ≈ 0.00107639 ft².

So 0.2128 cm²/s = 0.2128 * 0.00107639 ft²/s ≈ 0.0002288 ft²/s.

Now, to convert to ft²/hr: 0.0002288 ft²/s * 3600 s/hr ≈ 0.8237 ft²/hr.

So D ≈ 0.8237 ft²/hr.

Now, J = D * (dc/dx) = 0.8237 ft²/hr * 55.44 lb·mol/(ft⁴) ) → 0.8237 * 55.44 ≈ 45.67 lb·mol/(ft²·hr).

But that's way higher than any option given. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the mixture is 35% by volume, but when it's diffusing into still air, the concentration gradient is based on the mole fraction in the air, not the mixture.

Wait, perhaps I should model this using the concept of a membrane with thickness L, and the rate of mass transfer is J = (C1 * D) / L, where C1 is the concentration of water in the mixture.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the diffusion rate through a thin layer, which is J = (C1 * D) / L.

But in this case, C1 is the concentration of water in the mixture, which is 0.35 times the concentration of the mixture.

Wait, but maybe I should think in terms of molar flux. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the rate of diffusion as:

Rate = (y1 * n * D * A) / L

Where y1 is the mole fraction, n is the total molar concentration, A is the area, and L is the thickness.

But since the problem is asking for the rate per unit area (lb·mol/ft²·hr), we can ignore A.

So Rate = (y1 * n * D) / L.

Wait, that makes sense because J = (y1 * n * D) / L.

So J = (0.35 * 0.00264 lb·mol/ft³ * 0.8237 ft²/hr) / 0.016667 ft.

Let me compute that:

0.35 * 0.00264 ≈ 0.000924 lb·mol/ft³.

Multiply by D (0.8237 ft²/hr): 0.000924 * 0.8237 ≈ 0.000762 lb·mol/(ft·hr).

Divide by L (0.016667 ft): 0.000762 / 0.016667 ≈ 0.0457 lb·mol/(ft²·hr).

Hmm, that's about 0.0457, which is close to option F: 0.04 lb/mole/ft²·hr.

But wait, I'm not sure if this approach is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula J = (y1 * D * (n_air)) / L, where n_air is the molar concentration of air.

Wait, but I'm getting confused again. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Another approach: The rate of diffusion can be found using the formula:

Mass flow rate per area (J) = (C1 * D) / L

Where C1 is the concentration of water in the mixture.

But C1 is 0.35 times the concentration of the mixture.

The concentration of the mixture (n) is 0.00264 lb·mol/ft³, so C1 = 0.35 * 0.00264 ≈ 0.000924 lb·mol/ft³.

So J = (0.000924 lb·mol/ft³ * 0.8237 ft²/hr) / 0.016667 ft ≈ (0.000762 lb·mol/(ft·hr)) / 0.016667 ft ≈ 0.0457 lb·mol/(ft²·hr).

Which is approximately 0.046, close to option F: 0.04.

But wait, I think I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the formula is J = D * (C1 - C2)/L.

Since C2 is 0, J = D * C1 / L.

So J = (0.8237 ft²/hr) * (0.000924 lb·mol/ft³) / (0.016667 ft).

Let me compute that:

0.8237 * 0.000924 ≈ 0.000762 lb·mol/(ft·hr).

Divide by 0.016667 ft: 0.000762 / 0.016667 ≈ 0.0457 lb·mol/(ft²·hr).

So that's about 0.046, which is closest to option F: 0.04.

But looking at the options, option F is 0.04, which is one of the choices.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the diffusion coefficient might be different. Let me check if I used the correct D.

Wait, perhaps using D = 0.2 cm²/s at 20°C is not accurate. Let me find a more precise value.

I found that the diffusion coefficient of water vapor in air at 25°C and 1 atm is approximately 0.2 cm²/s. At 50°C, it increases to around 0.24 cm²/s. So at 59°C, perhaps it's around 0.25 cm²/s.

Let me recalculate with D = 0.25 cm²/s.

Convert to ft²/hr:

0.25 cm²/s * 0.00107639 ft²/cm² * 3600 s/hr ≈ 0.25 * 0.00107639 * 3600 ≈ 0.25 * 3.879 ≈ 0.9698 ft²/hr.

Now, J = (0.9698 ft²/hr * 0.000924 lb·mol/ft³) / 0.016667 ft.

Compute numerator: 0.9698 * 0.000924 ≈ 0.000896 lb·mol/(ft·hr).

Divide by 0.016667 ft: 0.000896 / 0.016667 ≈ 0.0538 lb·mol/(ft²·hr).

That's approximately 0.054, which is close to option I: 0.05.

But earlier calculation gave me about 0.046 with D=0.2128 cm²/s. Now, with D=0.25 cm²/s, it's 0.054.

Looking at the options, 0.05 is option I.

Hmm, but the options don't have 0.054. So perhaps the correct answer is around 0.05 lb/mole/ft²·hr.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe I should use the formula for the rate of mass transfer through a stagnant layer, which is given by:

N = k * C * A

Where k is the mass transfer coefficient, C is the concentration, and A is the area.

But without knowing k, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the Sherwood number, which relates the mass transfer coefficient to the diffusion coefficient and the flow velocity. But since the air is still, the flow velocity is zero, which complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is a case of molecular diffusion in a stagnant film, and the rate is given by:

Mass transfer rate per unit area, J = (C1 * D) / L.

Where C1 is the concentration of water in the mixture, D is the diffusion coefficient, and L is the thickness of the air layer.

So, C1 = 0.35 * n = 0.35 * 0.00264 ≈ 0.000924 lb·mol/ft³.

D ≈ 0.8237 ft²/hr.

L = 0.016667 ft.

So J = (0.000924 * 0.8237) / 0.016667 ≈ (0.000762) / 0.016667 ≈ 0.0457 lb·mol/(ft²·hr).

So that's about 0.046, which is closest to option F: 0.04.

But earlier, with a higher D of 0.25 cm²/s, I got 0.054, which is option I.

But I think the initial D calculation might be incorrect because I estimated it based on temperature scaling, which might not be accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for D in air for water vapor at 1 atm and 59°C. From literature, I found that at 25°C, D is about 0.2 cm²/s. At 50°C, it's about 0.23 cm²/s. So at 59°C, perhaps D is around 0.24 cm²/s.

Using D = 0.24 cm²/s:

Convert to ft²/hr: 0.24 * 0.00107639 * 3600 ≈ 0.24 * 3.879 ≈ 0.931 ft²/hr.

So J = (0.931 * 0.000924) / 0.016667 ≈ (0.000861) / 0.016667 ≈ 0.0517 lb·mol/(ft²·hr).

That's closer to 0.05, which is option I.

But considering that the options don't have 0.0517, but option I is 0.05, that's a possible answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem uses the diffusion coefficient in air at 1 atm and 59°C as 0.18 cm²/s, leading to a lower J.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a more accurate value of D. According to some sources, the diffusion coefficient of water vapor in air at 20°C and 1 atm is approximately 0.19 cm²/s. At 50°C, it's about 0.24 cm²/s.

So, using D = 0.24 cm²/s at 59°C.

Convert to ft²/hr: 0.24 cm²/s * (0.0328084 ft/cm)^2 = 0.24 * 0.00107639 ft²/s ≈ 0.00025833 ft²/s.

Multiply by 3600 s/hr: 0.00025833 * 3600 ≈ 0.930 ft²/hr.

Now, J = (0.930 ft²/hr * 0.000924 lb·mol/ft³) / 0.016667 ft.

Compute numerator: 0.930 * 0.000924 ≈ 0.000858 lb·mol/(ft·hr).

Divide by 0.016667 ft: 0.000858 / 0.016667 ≈ 0.0515 lb·mol/(ft²·hr).

That's approximately 0.0515, which is close to option I: 0.05.

But looking back at the options, option I is 0.05, and option E is 0.08. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the rate of mass transfer as:

Rate = ( (y1 - y2) / L ) * D * n

Where n is the total molar concentration.

So Rate = (0.35 / 0.016667 ft) * D * 0.00264 lb·mol/ft³.

Compute (0.35 / 0.016667) ≈ 21.0 per ft.

So Rate = 21.0 * D * 0.00264.

If D is 0.8237 ft²/hr, then:

21.0 * 0.8237 * 0.00264 ≈ 21 * 0.002176 ≈ 0.0457 lb·mol/(ft²·hr).

Again, that's about 0.0457, which is close to option F: 0.04.

But I'm getting conflicting results based on the value of D.

Perhaps the correct approach is to use J = (y1 * n * D) / L.

With y1=0.35, n=0.00264, D=0.8237, L=0.016667.

So J = (0.35 * 0.00264 * 0.8237) / 0.016667.

Compute numerator: 0.35 * 0.00264 ≈ 0.000924; 0.000924 * 0.8237 ≈ 0.000762.

Divide by 0.016667: 0.000762 / 0.016667 ≈ 0.0457 lb·mol/(ft²·hr).

So that's approximately 0.046, which would be closest to option F: 0.04.

But wait, perhaps I should double-check the units for D. Because in the formula, D should have units of ft²/hr, which I have.

Hmm, but the answer options don't have 0.046. The closest higher option is E: 0.08, but that's double.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the total molar concentration n.

Let me recalculate n using the ideal gas law. At 1 atm (14.7 psi) and 59°C (518.67 °R), n = P/(RT).

R = 10.73 psi·ft³/(lb·mol·°R).

So n = 14.7 / (10.73 * 518.67) ≈ 14.7 / (10.73 * 518.67).

Calculate denominator: 10.73 * 518.67 ≈ let's compute 10 * 518.67 = 5186.7, 0.73 * 518.67 ≈ 378.8. So total ≈ 5186.7 + 378.8 ≈ 5565.5.

So n ≈ 14.7 / 5565.5 ≈ 0.00264 lb·mol/ft³. That's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the problem expects the use of the diffusion coefficient in cm²/s, and then convert the final answer accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula:

J = (y1 * D * n) / L

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for J in terms of the molar flux, which is:

J = (y1 * n * D) / L

Which gives J ≈ 0.35 * 0.00264 * 0.8237 / 0.016667 ≈ 0.0457 lb·mol/(ft²·hr).

So perhaps the answer is approximately 0.046, which isn't exactly an option, but the closest is option F: 0.04.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of D. Let me try using D = 0.18 cm²/s.

Convert to ft²/hr: 0.18 * 0.00107639 * 3600 ≈ 0.18 * 3.879 ≈ 0.698 ft²/hr.

Then J = (0.18 * 0.00264 * 0.35) / 0.016667.

Wait, no, J = (y1 * n * D) / L.

So J = (0.35 * 0.00264 * 0.698) / 0.016667.

Compute numerator: 0.35 * 0.00264 ≈ 0.000924; 0.000924 * 0.698 ≈ 0.000645.

Divide by 0.016667: 0.000645 / 0.016667 ≈ 0.0388 lb·mol/(ft²·hr).

That's about 0.039, closest to option H: 0.02, but not quite.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, maybe I should consider the units of the options. The options are in lb/mole/ft²·hr, which is the same as (lb·mol)/(ft²·hr). But J is usually in mol/(m²·s), so the units here are different.

Wait, perhaps I should check the units again. The problem asks for the rate of water diffusing through the air layer, in lb/mole/ft²·hr. So that's (lb·mol)/(ft²·hr).

Wait, but I think I have that correct in my calculations.

Another thought: Maybe the problem is using the concept of flux per unit area, and I should consider that the concentration gradient is in mole fraction per inch, and D is in ft²/hr.

But I'm not making progress here. Given the time I've spent, I think the closest answer based on my calculations is around 0.046, which would be option F: 0.04.

But another approach: Maybe I should use the formula for J in terms of the molar flux as:

J = (y1 * P * D) / (L * R * T)

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the diffusion flux as:

J = (y1 * D * n) / L.

Which is what I did earlier.

So, given that, I think the answer is approximately 0.046, which is closest to option F: 0.04.

But looking at the options, option F is 0.04, which is a possible answer.

To determine the rate of water diffusing through the air layer, we analyze the problem using Fick's first law of diffusion:

\[
J = -D \cdot \frac{dc}{dx}
\]

Where:
- \( J \) is the molar flux (moles per area per time),
- \( D \) is the diffusion coefficient,
- \( \frac{dc}{dx} \) is the concentration gradient.

### Key Steps:
1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The mixture is 35% water by volume, so the mole fraction of water (\( y_1 \)) is 0.35.
   - The air layer has a thickness \( L = 0.2 \, \text{in} = 0.016667 \, \text{ft} \).
   - At the absorption plane, the water concentration is negligible (\( y_2 \approx 0 \)).

2. **Concentration Gradient**:
   The concentration gradient is calculated as:
   \[
   \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{L} = \frac{0 - 0.35}{0.016667} \approx -21.0 \, \text{(unitless)/ft}.
   \]

3. **Diffusion Coefficient**:
   The diffusion coefficient \( D \) for water vapor in air at \( 1 \, \text{atm} \) and \( 59^\circ \text{C} \) is estimated to be approximately \( 0.2 \, \text{cm}^2/\text{s} \). Converting to \( \text{ft}^2/\text{hr} \):
   \[
   D \approx 0.2 \cdot 0.00107639 \cdot 3600 \approx 0.756 \, \text{ft}^2/\text{hr}.
   \]

4. **Molar Flux**:
   Using Fick's law, the molar flux \( J \) is:
   \[
   J = D \cdot \left| \frac{dy}{dx} \right| = 0.756 \cdot 21.0 \approx 15.88 \, \text{lb·mol}/\text{ft}^2\text{·hr}.
   \]

5. **Adjusting for Molar Concentration**:
   The total molar concentration \( n \) of the air-water mixture is calculated using the ideal gas law:
   \[
   n = \frac{P}{RT} = \frac{14.7}{10.73 \cdot 518.67} \approx 0.00264 \, \text{lb·mol}/\text{ft}^3.
   \]
   The concentration of water is \( c_1 = y_1 \cdot n = 0.35 \cdot 0.00264 \approx 0.000924 \, \text{lb·mol}/\text{ft}^3 \).

6. **Final Calculation**:
   The molar flux is adjusted for the concentration gradient:
   \[
   J = \frac{c_1 \cdot D}{L} = \frac{0.000924 \cdot 0.756}{0.016667} \approx 0.042 \, \text{lb·mol}/\text{ft}^2\text{·hr}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The calculated rate of water diffusing through the air layer is approximately \( 0.042 \, \text{lb·mol}/\text{ft}^2\text{·hr} \), which aligns closely with option **F: 0.04**.
