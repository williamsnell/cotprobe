Okay, so I've got this question about memory systems, specifically about a purely segmented memory system. I'm a bit rusty on my operating systems concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which statements describe properties of a purely segmented memory system. There are three statements (I, II, III) and the options are combinations of these.

First, I need to remember what a purely segmented memory system is. From what I recall, segmentation is a memory management technique where the memory is divided into segments, each with a specific name and size. Unlike paging, which divides memory into fixed-size blocks (pages), segmentation allows for variable-sized segments. Each segment can be treated as a contiguous block of memory, which is useful for applications that have logical groupings of data and instructions.

Let's go through each statement one by one.

Statement I: It divides memory into units of equal size.
Hmm, wait. I think segmentation doesn't require equal-sized segments. Unlike paging, where each page is the same size, segments can vary. So if the statement says equal size, that's probably not correct. So I would say statement I is false.

Statement II: It permits implementation of virtual memory.
Virtual memory is a technique that allows a computer to use more memory than it physically has by swapping data between physical memory and secondary storage. I remember that segmentation can support virtual memory because each segment can be mapped to a virtual address space. So statement II is probably true.

Statement III: It suffers from internal fragmentation.
Internal fragmentation refers to wasted space within a memory block. Paging systems can have internal fragmentation because a page might not be completely filled. In segmentation, since each segment is variable-sized and tailored to a specific part of the program, the fragmentation might be less. Wait, no—actually, no, wait. Segmentation can lead to external fragmentation, where the free memory isn't contiguous, but internal fragmentation is more about the unused space within a block. Since segments are variable, perhaps internal fragmentation isn't a big issue. So maybe statement III is false, or perhaps I'm mixing up with paging. Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again: in paging, you have fixed-size pages, so the last page might not be fully used, leading to internal fragmentation. In segmentation, each segment is exactly the size needed, so there's no internal fragmentation. So statement III says it suffers from internal fragmentation, which would be false.

Wait, but I might be wrong. Let me double-check. Segmentation is supposed to avoid internal fragmentation because each segment is allocated exactly as needed. So statement III is incorrect. Therefore, the statements that are correct are only statement II.

Looking back at the options:

A: I only → I is false, so A is wrong.
B: II only → II is true, so B is correct.
C: III only → III is false, so C is wrong.
D: I and III → Both are false, so D is wrong.

Therefore, the correct answer should be B: II only.

The correct answer is B: II only.

Answer: B
