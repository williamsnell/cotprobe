Question:

Which of the following correctly illustrates why price (P) equals marginal revenue (MR) under perfect competition, and why price (P) is greater than marginal revenue under monopoly or imperfect competition? I. MR = P = demand on horizontal function for perfect competition. II. P > MR as downward sloping functions for imperfect competition. III. Demand and Price are represented as a vertical function for imperfect competition.

Options:

A: II and III, with the addition of IV. Demand and Price are represented as a downward sloping function for monopoly.
B: I, II and III, with the addition of IV. Demand and Price are represented as a horizontal function for perfect competition.
C: I and II.
D: I and III.
E: I, II, and III.
F: I only.
G: II only.
H: I and III, with the addition of IV. MR = P = demand on downward sloping function for monopoly.
I: III only.
J: II and III.

Okay, so I've got this economics question here about why price equals marginal revenue (MR) under perfect competition and why P is greater than MR under monopoly or imperfect competition. I remember from my studies that perfect competition and monopoly have different market structures, especially regarding how pricing and MR work.

First, let me break down the concepts. In perfect competition, there are a lot of firms and each one is a price taker. That means they have to accept the market price, right? So the demand curve for each firm is perfectly elastic, which is a horizontal line. Because of this, the marginal revenue (MR) is equal to the price (P). Because every additional unit sold adds the same revenue. So statement I says MR = P = demand on a horizontal function for perfect competition. That makes sense.

Now, under monopoly or imperfect competition, the situation is different. These firms face a downward-sloping demand curve. So when they increase their output, to sell more, they have to lower the price. That means the MR is less than the price because MR is the additional revenue from selling one more unit, which requires lowering the price for all units. So P is greater than MR. That lines up with statement II, which says P > MR as downward sloping functions for imperfect competition.

Statement III says demand and price are represented as a vertical function for imperfect competition. Hmm, I'm not sure about that. Wait, a vertical demand curve would mean that even if the price changes, the quantity demanded doesn't change. That doesn't seem right. Monopolies and imperfect competition have downward-sloping demand curves, not vertical. So III might be incorrect.

Looking at the options, option C says I and II. That sounds correct because I is true for perfect competition and II is true for imperfect competition. Other options include more statements. Option E includes I, II, and III, but since III might be wrong, E isn't right. Option B and D include III, which I think is incorrect. Option H adds IV, which seems to mix up things. So the correct answer should be C: I and II.

The correct answer is C: I and II.
