Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the thickness of a quartz plate. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says we need a plate cut perpendicular to the optic axis, and it should rotate the blue mercury line of wavelength 435.8 nm by 180 degrees. The options are A to J, with various millimeter measurements.

Wait, I remember something about quartz plates and optical activity. Oh right, quartz is a birefringent material, meaning it has two different refractive indices for light polarized in different directions. When light passes through a quartz plate, it can cause the plane of polarization to rotate. This effect is called the optic rotation.

The formula I think is related to the rotation angle. I recall that the rotation angle θ is given by θ = (6.627 × 10^-4) * (n_2 - n_1) * (d) * (λ / (n_avg)) ), but wait, I might be mixing up some terms. Alternatively, I think the formula is θ = ( (n_o - n_e) * d ) / λ, where n_o is the ordinary refractive index, n_e is the extraordinary, and d is the thickness. But wait, the exact formula might vary based on the specific conditions.

Wait, another thought: The formula I'm more confident about is θ = ( (n_2 - n_1) * d ) / λ, but I need to check the constants correctly. Oh, wait, no, that's not quite right. Maybe it's θ = (2π (n_2 - n_1) d) / (λ), but that would be in terms of radians. Or perhaps I should consider the specific rotation constants for quartz.

Wait, I think the correct formula is θ = ( (n_e - n_o) * d ) / (λ) * (180/π), where θ is in degrees. Or maybe I should use the formula θ = ( (n_e - n_o) * d ) / (λ) * (180/π), because sometimes the rotation is given in radians and we have to convert to degrees.

Wait, I remember that for quartz, the specific rotation [α] is given as approximately 37.7 degrees per mm for the e-ray. Or wait, is it 37.7 degrees per mm for a specific wavelength? Because the rotation depends on the wavelength. Oh, right, the specific rotation varies with wavelength. For the mercury blue line, which is around 435.8 nm, the specific rotation is about 37.7 degrees per mm.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The formula for the rotation angle θ is θ = [α] * d, where [α] is the specific rotation constant, and d is the thickness of the plate. So if I know θ and [α], I can solve for d.

So, given θ is 180 degrees, and [α] is approximately 37.7 degrees per mm for blue light. Wait, but wait—does the specific rotation change with wavelength? Because different wavelengths have different rotation angles. Yes, I think for blue light, it's around 37.7 degrees per mm, but perhaps for the specific wavelength given, 435.8 nm, the value might be slightly different.

Wait, but the problem might be using an approximate value. Let me check. If [α] is 37.7 degrees per mm, then θ = 37.7 * d. We want θ to be 180 degrees, so d = 180 / 37.7 ≈ 4.774 mm. Hmm, but that's not one of the options exactly. The closest is option B: 4.9 mm, or maybe option C: 4.36 mm. Wait, perhaps my specific rotation value is a bit off.

Alternatively, maybe the specific rotation is given as 37.7 radians per meter or something else. Wait, no, because 37.7 degrees per mm would mean that for each mm, you get 37.7 degrees of rotation. So for 180, you'd need about 4.77 mm. But wait, maybe the specific rotation is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula involving the refractive indices. The rotation angle θ can be calculated using θ = ( (n_e - n_o) * d ) / λ * (180 / π). Wait, but I don't know the exact values of n_o and n_e for quartz. Let me think: for quartz, n_o is approximately 1.544, and n_e is about 1.553. So n_e - n_o is about 0.009.

So plugging in the numbers: θ = (0.009 * d) / (435.8e-9 m) * (180 / π). Wait, but I'm getting confused with units. Let's be precise.

First, let's make sure all the units are correct. θ is in degrees, d is in meters, λ in meters.

So θ = ( (n_e - n_o) * d ) / λ * (180 / π )

So, n_e - n_o ≈ 0.009.

λ = 435.8 nm = 435.8e-9 meters.

So θ = (0.009 * d) / (435.8e-9) * (180/3.1416)

We need θ = 180 degrees.

So 180 = (0.009 * d) / (435.8e-9) * (57.2958) [since 180/π ≈57.2958]

Let me compute that step by step.

First, compute (0.009) / (435.8e-9) = 0.009 / 0.0000004358 = 0.009 / 4.358e-6 ≈ 2064.75.

Then multiply by 57.2958: 2064.75 *57.2958 ≈ 2064.75 *57 ≈ let's see, 2000*57=114000, 64.75*57≈3690. So total around 117,690.

So equation becomes 180 = (d) * 117,690.

So d = 180 / 117690 ≈ 0.00153 meters, which is 1.53 mm. Wait, that's way too small compared to the options given. So that can't be right. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Maybe the correct formula is θ = ( (n_e - n_o) * d ) / (λ) * (180 / π )

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is θ = ( (n_e - n_o) * d ) / (λ) * (180 / π )

Wait, let me double-check the formula. Another approach: the rotation angle θ (in radians) is given by θ = ( (n_e - n_o) * d ) / λ * (180/π)

Wait, but I might be mixing radians and degrees. Let me get the formula correct.

I think the correct formula is θ (in degrees) = ( (n_e - n_o) * d ) / (λ in nm) ) * (2π) * (180/π) ) = ( (n_e - n_o) * d ) / λ (nm) ) * 360. Because each wavelength corresponds to 360 degrees of phase shift.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. The phase shift φ is 2π(n_e - n_o) d / λ (in meters). The rotation angle θ in radians is φ/2, because the rotation is half the phase shift. So θ (radians) = π (n_e - n_o) d / λ.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the exact derivation. Let me look for another approach. Alternatively, maybe the formula is θ = ( (n_e - n_o) * d ) / (λ) ) * (180/π). So:

θ = ( (n_e - n_o) * d ) / (λ) * (180/π )

So with θ = 180 degrees, n_e - n_o = 0.009, λ = 435.8 nm.

Plugging in:

180 = (0.009 * d) / (435.8e-9) * (180 / π )

Wait, but that would imply d = (180 * 435.8e-9 * π ) / (0.009 * 180 )

Simplify:

d = (435.8e-9 * π ) / 0.009

Compute that:

π ≈3.1416, so:

435.8e-9 * 3.1416 ≈ 1.369e-6

Divide by 0.009: 1.369e-6 / 0.009 ≈ 1.521e-4 meters, which is 0.1521 mm. That's way too small, so I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Hmm, maybe the formula is θ = ( (n_e - n_o) * d ) * (180 / λ ) * (1e9) ) / (π). Because λ is in nm, so converting to meters by multiplying by 1e-9.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express λ in meters correctly. Let me try again.

θ (in degrees) = ( (n_e - n_o) * d (m) ) / (λ (m) ) ) * (180 / π )

So, let's compute:

θ = [ (0.009) * d ] / (435.8e-9) * (180 / 3.1416 )

We have θ = 180 degrees.

So,

180 = [0.009 * d ] / (4.358e-7) * (57.2958 )

Because 435.8e-9 meters is 435.8 nm, which is 435.8e-9 m = 4.358e-7 m.

So,

180 = (0.009 * d) / 4.358e-7 * 57.2958

Let me compute the denominator and constants first.

Compute (0.009) / 4.358e-7 = 0.009 / 0.0000004358 ≈ 20647.5.

Then multiply by 57.2958: 20647.5 *57.2958 ≈ let's compute 20647.5 *57 ≈ 1,175,  (wait, 20647.5 *57 = 20647.5 *50=1,032,375; 20647.5 *7=144,532.5 → total≈1,176,907.5).

So now,

180 ≈ (d) * 1,176,907.5

So d ≈ 180 / 1,176,907.5 ≈ 0.000153 meters → 0.153 mm. That's way too small, but the options are in mm and are much larger. So I must have messed up the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should be using the specific rotation formula instead. Specific rotation [α] is given by [α] = θ / d, where θ is in degrees and d is in mm. So, [α] = θ / d → d = θ / [α].

If [α] is 37.7 degrees/mm, then for θ=180 degrees,

d = 180 / 37.7 ≈ 4.774 mm. Looking at the options, option B is 4.9 mm, which is close, but option C is 4.36 mm. Hmm, perhaps the specific rotation value is different for 435.8 nm.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me check if I have the correct specific rotation value. I think for quartz, the specific rotation at 589 nm (sodium light) is about 37.7 degrees/mm, but it changes with wavelength. For blue light (around 435.8 nm), the specific rotation might be higher.

Wait, perhaps the specific rotation [α] is approximately 50 degrees per mm for blue light. Then d = 180 /50 =3.6 mm, which is close to option J:3.5 mm or option G:3.14 mm. But I'm not sure about the exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the wavelength and the specific rotation at that wavelength. Let me see if I can find the specific rotation for 435.8 nm. From what I remember, the specific rotation increases as the wavelength decreases. So for blue light (shorter wavelength), the [α] is higher than for yellow or red light.

Wait, perhaps the specific rotation at 435.8 nm is around 45 degrees/mm. Then d would be 180 /45 =4 mm, which is option A:4.0 mm. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Another approach: the rotation per unit length is given by [α] = (n_e - n_o) * (180 * 1e3) / (λ in nm * π )

Wait, let's compute [α]:

[α] = (n_e - n_o) * (180 * 1000) / (λ * π )

Given n_e - n_o = 0.009, λ=435.8 nm.

So,

[α] = 0.009 * 180000 / (435.8 * 3.1416 )

Compute denominator: 435.8 *3.1416 ≈1369.5.

So,

[α] ≈ (0.009 * 180000) / 1369.5 ≈ 1620 /1369.5 ≈ 1.183 degrees/mm.

Wait, that's way too low. So [α]=1.183 degrees/mm. Then d=180/1.183≈152.17 mm, which is way beyond the options. So that can't be right.

Wait, I think I messed up the formula again. Another approach: the formula for specific rotation is [α] = (n_e - n_o) * (2π) / (λ) ) * (180/π) ) *1e3 mm/m.

Wait, let's compute [α] in degrees/mm.

[α] = (n_e - n_o) * (2π) / (λ in m) ) * (180/π) ) * (1e3 mm/m) / (1e3) → wait, no, perhaps better to compute it in mm and nm.

Wait, perhaps [α] = (n_e - n_o) * (180 * 1e3) / (λ in nm * π )

So,

[α] = 0.009 * 180000 / (435.8 *3.1416 )

Compute denominator: 435.8 *3.1416 ≈1369.5.

So,

[α] ≈ (0.009 * 180000) / 1369.5 ≈ 1620 /1369.5 ≈1.183 degrees/mm.

Again, same result, which gives d=152 mm, which is not possible.

I must be making a mistake in the formula. Let me try a different approach. Let's look up the formula for the rotation of plane polarized light in a quartz plate. The formula is θ = ( (n_e - n_o) * d ) / (λ) ) * (180 / π ), where θ is in degrees, d in meters, λ in meters.

So,

θ = ( (n_e - n_o) * d ) / λ * (180 / π )

We have θ=180 degrees, n_e -n_o=0.009, λ=435.8e-9 meters.

So,

180 = (0.009 * d) / (435.8e-9) * (180 / 3.1416 )

Simplify:

180 = (0.009 * d) / (4.358e-7) * 57.2958

Compute (0.009)/(4.358e-7) → 0.009 /0.0000004358 ≈20647.5.

Multiply by 57.2958: 20647.5 *57.2958 ≈1,176,907.5.

So,

180 = d * 1,176,907.5 → d = 180 / 1,176,907.5 ≈0.000153 meters → 0.153 mm.

That's way too small. So I must have the formula wrong. I think I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere, perhaps because the extraordinary ray undergoes a phase shift that's twice that of the ordinary ray, leading to a rotation proportional to that difference.

Wait, maybe the formula should have (n_e - n_o) multiplied by d, then divided by λ, then multiplied by 2π radians, and then converted to degrees.

Wait, let's think in terms of radians. The phase difference between the two polarizations is 2π(n_e - n_o)d / λ, and the rotation angle θ is half of that phase difference in radians. So θ (radians) = π(n_e -n_o)d / λ.

So,

θ (degrees) = [ π (n_e -n_o) d / λ ] * (180/π ) = [ (n_e -n_o) d * 180 ] / (λ )

So,

θ = (0.009 * d * 180 ) / (435.8e-9 )

We have θ=180 degrees.

So,

180 = (0.009 * d * 180 ) / (435.8e-9 )

Simplify:

Divide both sides by 180:

1 = (0.009 * d ) / (435.8e-9 )

→ 0.009 * d = 435.8e-9 → d= (435.8e-9 ) / 0.009 → d=435.8e-9 /9e-3 → 435.8e-6 /9 →≈48.422e-6 meters → 0.048422 mm → 48.422 microns. That's about 0.048 mm, which is way too small. But that can't be right because the options are much larger.

Wait, I'm clearly messing up the formula. Let me try to find the correct formula elsewhere. From what I recall, the formula for the rotation angle θ is θ = ( (n_e - n_o) * d ) / (λ) * (180 / π ), where d is in the same units as the wavelength.

Wait, but the wavelength is in nm, and d in mm. So perhaps I should convert d to meters or keep everything in the same units.

Wait, let's try plugging in d in meters and λ in meters.

θ = ( (n_e - n_o) * d ) / λ * (180 / π )

n_e -n_o=0.009,

λ=435.8e-9 m,

θ=180 degrees.

So,

180 = (0.009 * d) / (435.8e-9) * (180 / 3.1416 )

Simplify:

Divide both sides by 180:

1 = (0.009 * d) / (435.8e-9) * (1/3.1416 )

→ (0.009 * d) / (435.8e-9) = 3.1416

→ d = (3.1416 * 435.8e-9 ) / 0.009

Calculate numerator: 3.1416 *435.8e-9 ≈1369.5e-9 =1.3695e-6

Divide by 0.009: 1.3695e-6 /0.009 ≈1.5217e-4 meters → 0.15217 mm → 0.152 mm.

Again, this gives a very small d, which doesn't match the options. I must have the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula is θ = ( (n_e - n_o) * d ) * (180 *10^3 ) / (λ * π )

So,

θ = (0.009 * d *180000 ) / (435.8 *3.1416 )

Set θ=180:

180 = (0.009 * d *180000 ) / (1369.5 )

Simplify:

Multiply both sides by 1369.5 → 180 *1369.5 ≈246,450.

So,

246,450 = 0.009 * d *180000 → 0.009 *180000=1620.

So,

246450 =1620 *d → d=246450 /1620 ≈152.135 mm.

That's way too big, so this can't be right either.

I'm clearly stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. I think the correct formula is θ = ( (n_e -n_o) * d ) / (λ) ) * (180/π ), but perhaps I'm missing a factor. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is θ = ( (n_e -n_o) * d ) / (λ in nm) ) * (180/π )

Wait, let's try that.

θ = (0.009 * d ) / (435.8) * (180/3.1416 )

Set θ=180:

180 = (0.009 * d ) /435.8 * 57.2958

Compute (0.009 *57.2958 ) =0.51566.

So,

180 = (0.51566 * d ) /435.8 → 180 = (0.51566 /435.8 ) *d → 0.51566/435.8≈0.001183.

So,

180=0.001183 *d → d=180/0.001183 ≈152, 152, 152, 152 mm? No, that's 152 mm, which is way off the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is θ = ( (n_e -n_o) * d ) * (180 *1e3 ) / (λ * π )

So,

θ = (0.009 * d * 180000 ) / (435.8 *3.1416 )

= (1620 * d ) / 1369.5

Set θ=180:

180 = (1620 d ) / 1369.5 → d= (180 *1369.5 ) /1620 → d= (246,450 ) /1620 ≈152.135 mm. Again, same as before.

This isn't working. Maybe I should try looking up the specific rotation formula. Specific rotation [α] is defined as the rotation per unit length, usually in degrees per mm. For quartz, [α] is known to be approximately 37.7 degrees/mm for the e-ray at 589 nm (sodium light). But for blue light (around 435.8 nm), [α] increases because the specific rotation varies inversely with wavelength.

So, [α] = θ/d → d=θ/[α].

If I can find [α] for 435.8 nm, I can compute d.

Since [α] is inversely proportional to wavelength, [α]_blue = [α]_yellow * (λ_yellow / λ_blue )

Assuming [α]_yellow (589 nm) is 37.7 degrees/mm.

So,

[α]_blue = 37.7 * (589 /435.8 ) ≈37.7 *1.3517 ≈51.0 degrees/mm.

Then,

d=180 /51≈3.529 mm. Looking at the options, option J is 3.5 mm. So that's close.

Alternatively, perhaps the specific rotation is 37.7 degrees/mm at 589 nm, and since the wavelength is shorter, [α] increases. Let me compute [α] for 435.8 nm.

Using the relation [α] ∝1/λ,

[α]_blue = [α]_yellow * (λ_yellow/λ_blue )

= 37.7 * (589 /435.8 )

Compute 589/435.8 ≈1.3517.

So,

[α]_blue ≈37.7 *1.3517 ≈51.0 degrees/mm.

Thus, d=180 /51≈3.529 mm, which is approximately 3.53 mm. The closest option is J:3.5 mm.

But wait, looking back, earlier when I tried the formula with [α]=37.7, I thought d was about 4.77 mm, but that was using the wrong approach. Now, using the wavelength-adjusted [α], I get around 3.5 mm.

Alternatively, perhaps the specific rotation is given as 37.7 degrees per mm for 435.8 nm. Then d=180/37.7≈4.77 mm, which would be closest to option B:4.9 mm.

But I'm not sure. Let me check the options again. The options are:

A:4.0 mm

B:4.9 mm

C:4.36 mm

E:2.98 mm

F:7.0 mm

G:3.14 mm

H:6.25 mm

I:5.75 mm

J:3.5 mm

If [α] is 37.7 degrees/mm, then d=4.77 mm → option B:4.9 mm. But if [α] is 51 degrees/mm, d≈3.5 mm → option J.

I think the correct approach is to use the specific rotation at the given wavelength. Since the problem doesn't provide specific rotation, I assume it uses the standard value for blue light. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses (n_e -n_o) and the wavelength to calculate it.

Wait, another approach: the rotation angle θ is given by θ = ( (n_e -n_o) * d ) / (λ) * (180/π ), but I have to make sure the units are correct.

n_e -n_o=0.009.

λ=435.8 nm=435.8e-9 m.

So,

θ = (0.009 * d ) / (435.8e-9) * (180/3.1416 )

Set θ=180:

180 = (0.009 *d ) / (4.358e-7) * 57.2958.

Compute:

(0.009 /4.358e-7)= 0.009 /0.0000004358 ≈20647.5.

Multiply by 57.2958: 20647.5 *57.2958 ≈1,176,907.5.

So,

180 = d * 1,176,907.5 → d=180 /1,176,907.5≈0.000153 meters=0.153 mm.

That's way too small, so something's wrong with the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should use d in mm and λ in nm. Let me try:

θ = ( (n_e -n_o) * d (mm) ) / (λ (nm) ) * (180 * 1e3 ) / (π )

So,

θ = (0.009 * d ) / (435.8 ) * (180000 /3.1416 )

Compute:

(0.009 /435.8 )= 2.06475e-5.

Multiply by 180000/3.1416≈57295.8.

So,

θ= 2.06475e-5 *57295.8 *d ≈ (2.06475e-5 *57295.8 ) *d ≈1.183 *d.

Set θ=180:

180=1.183*d → d=180/1.183≈152.17 mm.

Again, way too large. I'm clearly making a mistake here.

Perhaps I should give up and go with the [α] method, which gave me around 3.5 mm when adjusting for wavelength. So the closest option is J:3.5 mm. Alternatively, if [α] is 37.7, then option B:4.9 mm.

But I'm not confident. Another thought: maybe the formula is θ = ( (n_e -n_o) * d ) / (λ) * (180 / π ), but with d in mm and λ in nm.

So,

θ= (0.009 * d (mm) ) / (435.8 nm ) * (180 /3.1416 )

Wait, but units: d in mm is 1e-3 m, λ in nm is 1e-9 m.

So,

θ= (0.009 * d *1e-3 ) / (435.8e-9 ) * (57.2958 )

= (0.009e-3 d ) / (435.8e-9 ) *57.2958

= (0.009e-3 /435.8e-9 ) *d *57.2958

Compute 0.009e-3 =9e-6, 435.8e-9=4.358e-7.

So,

9e-6 /4.358e-7 ≈20.647.

Multiply by 57.2958: 20.647 *57.2958≈1176.9.

So,

θ=1176.9 *d → set θ=180: d=180/1176.9≈0.153 mm. Again, same result.

I'm stuck. I think I'll have to go with the specific rotation approach, adjusting for wavelength. So [α] increases with shorter wavelength, giving d≈3.5 mm, which is option J.

To calculate the required thickness of a quartz plate that rotates the blue mercury line \(\lambda = 435.8 \, \text{nm}\) by \(180^\circ\), we use the concept of specific rotation. Specific rotation \([\alpha]\) is defined as the rotation per unit length (in degrees per mm) and depends on the wavelength of light. For blue light (\(\lambda = 435.8 \, \text{nm}\)), the specific rotation is approximately \(51.0^\circ/\text{mm}\), adjusted from the standard value of \(37.7^\circ/\text{mm}\) for yellow light (\(\lambda = 589 \, \text{nm}\)) using the inverse proportionality of specific rotation with wavelength.

The formula for the thickness \(d\) is:

\[
d = \frac{\theta}{[\alpha]}
\]

Substituting \(\theta = 180^\circ\) and \([\alpha] = 51.0^\circ/\text{mm}\):

\[
d = \frac{180}{51.0} \approx 3.53 \, \text{mm}
\]

The closest option to this value is **J: 3.5 mm**.

**Answer: J**
