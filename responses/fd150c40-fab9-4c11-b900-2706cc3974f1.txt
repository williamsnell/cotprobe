Okay, so I have this question about the Data Encryption Standard (DES), and I need to figure out the correct answer. The question is asking about the sub key length at each round of DES. Let me try to remember what I know about DES.

First, I recall that DES uses a 56-bit key. The process involves multiple rounds of encryption, and in each round, a subkey is used. I think the key is divided into multiple parts, which are then used as subkeys during each round.

Wait, how many rounds does DES have? I think it's 16 rounds. Yeah, that's right. So the 56-bit key is somehow split into these subkeys for each round. Let me think about how that works.

I remember that the key is first processed through a key schedule to generate these subkeys. The key is divided into two halves, each 28 bits long. These halves are alternately used to generate each subkey. So for each round, the subkey is created by taking bits from these two halves.

But wait, how many bits are in each subkey? I think each subkey is 48 bits. Because the block size is 64 bits, but the key is 56 bits, and each subkey is used to perform certain operations during each round.

Wait, let me break it down. The initial key is 56 bits. It's divided into two 28-bit halves. Then, for each round, a subkey of 48 bits is generated by combining these two halves in a specific way. I think the process involves shifting the halves and then combining them. So each subkey is 48 bits long.

So looking at the options, the answer should be F: 48.

The sub key length at each round of DES is 48 bits. This is because the 56-bit key is divided into two 28-bit halves, which are then combined to generate a 48-bit subkey for each of the 16 rounds.

Answer: F
