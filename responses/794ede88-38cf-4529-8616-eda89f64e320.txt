Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the first standardized measure of assessment. The options are from A to J, each being a different test. I'm a bit rusty on my psychology history, but I'll try to think this through step by step.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It's about the first standardized measure of assessment. Standardized tests are ones that have consistent administration and scoring methods, right? So the question is asking which of these options was the first such test.

Let me go through the options one by one and see which ones I recognize as early standardized tests.

Option A: Thematic Apperception Test (TAT). I think TAT is a projective test where people tell stories about ambiguous pictures. It's used to assess personality, but I don't think it's the first standardized test. It was developed in the 1930s, I believe.

Option B: Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS). This is a well-known IQ test, developed by David Wechsler. But I think the first standardized IQ test was the Stanford-Binet, so maybe this isn't the first.

Option C: Stanford Binet. Oh, this rings a bell. The Stanford-Binet was an early version of the IQ test, standardized and developed by Lewis Terman. It was based on Binet's original work. So this could be a strong candidate.

Option D: Holtzman Inkblot Test. I'm not too familiar with this one. It sounds like another inkblot test, similar to the Rorschach. I don't think this is the earliest.

Option E: Raven’s Progressive Matrices. This is a non-verbal test measuring abstract reasoning. It's used widely, but I think it was developed later, maybe in the mid-20th century. Not the first standardized.

Option F: Binet–Simon Scale. This is the original version created by Alfred Binet and Théodore Simon in the early 1900s. It was the precursor to the Stanford-Binet. So this might be the first, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the Binet-Simon is considered the first, and then Stanford-Binet improved it.

Option G: Rorschach Inkblot Test. Developed by Hermann Rorschach in 1921. That's after the Binet-Simon, so probably not the first standardized.

Option H: Minnesota Clerical Test. I think this is an older test, maybe from the 1920s or 30s, used for assessing clerical workers. But I'm not sure if it's the first standardized measure.

Option I: Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI). Developed in the 1940s by Hathaway and McKinley. Definitely not the first standardized test; it's more of a personality assessment tool.

Option J: Woodcock–Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities. These were developed much later, in the 1970s I think. So not the first.

So, from this, the options seem to narrow down to either F (Binet-Simon Scale) or C (Stanford Binet). The question is about the first standardized measure. The Binet-Simon Scale was introduced in 1908 by Binet and Simon. Then, Lewis Terman adapted it for the United States, publishing the Stanford-Binet in 1916. So the Binet-Simon was the first standardized test, but sometimes it's referred to as the Stanford Binet because of Terman's work.

Wait, but the question is about the first standardized measure. So the original Binet-Simon Scale was the first, but if the options include both, which one is considered the first? The question's options are F and C. So F is the Binet-Simon Scale, and C is the Stanford Binet. So F would be the correct one because it was the first standardized test.

Wait, but sometimes people might think of the Stanford Binet as the first because it's more well-known in the US. But the original Binet-Simon was indeed the first standardized IQ test. So the answer should be F.

Alternatively, the question might consider the Stanford Binet as the first standardized because it's the first to use the term and be widely adopted. Hmm. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The Binet-Simon Scale was the first standardized test, developed in 1908. Then the Stanford Binet was an adaptation. So the first standardized would be the Binet-Simon, which is option F.

Wait, but option C is Stanford Binet. So if the question is about the first standardized, it's F. But the options have F as Binet-Simon and C as Stanford Binet. So the correct answer would be F.

The first standardized measure of assessment was the **Binet-Simon Scale**, developed in 1908 by Alfred Binet and Théodore Simon. This test laid the foundation for modern intelligence testing and was later adapted into the Stanford Binet by Lewis Terman in 1916. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: F**
