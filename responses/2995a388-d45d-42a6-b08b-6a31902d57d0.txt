Okay, so I've got this question about why most people can tell the difference between Coke and Pepsi most of the time. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my psychology terms, but let's think this through. 

The question is asking which concept explains this ability. The options are A through J, each a different psychological term. I remember that these terms relate to perception and sensation, so I should focus on those areas.

First, let me recall what each option means. 

Option A is Depth perception. That's about how we perceive the 3D structure of objects, right? Like how we see things in three dimensions. Doesn't seem directly related to tasting differences between two drinks.

Option B is Sensory adaptation. That's when our senses adjust to a constant stimulus, making us less sensitive to it over time. For example, not noticing a bad smell after being around it for a while. But how does that explain detecting a difference between two things? Maybe not this one.

Option C is Subliminal perception. That's when we process information without being aware of it, like seeing something quickly without noticing. Doesn't seem relevant here because detecting a difference is conscious.

Option D is Perceptual constancy. That's about perceiving things as the same despite changes in conditions. Like always seeing a chair as a chair whether it's lit or dark. Doesn't fit because we're talking about noticing differences, not perceiving sameness.

Option E is Gestalt principles. Those are about how we organize visual information into patterns. Like seeing a face in a crowd. Not directly related to taste or detecting differences in two things.

Option F is Absolute threshold. That's the minimum level of stimulation needed to detect something. Like the quietest sound you can hear. But this is about detecting something at all, not the difference between two things.

Option G is Signal detection theory. This theory explains how we detect stimuli above a certain level, considering factors like noise and decision criteria. Maybe relevant because it's about determining if a signal (difference) is present above the noise.

Option H is Divided attention. That's about focusing on multiple tasks at once. Doesn't seem related to detecting differences in taste.

Option I is Selective attention. This is about focusing on certain stimuli while ignoring others. Again, not directly about distinguishing between two similar things.

Option J is Difference threshold. Oh wait, I think this is also called the just noticeable difference (JND). It's the smallest difference in stimuli that a person can detect. So, if two things differ by more than the JND, people can tell them apart. That sounds exactly like what the question is about.

Wait, but I should make sure. The question is about most people detecting the difference most of the time. So, it's about their ability to notice a difference when there is one. The difference threshold (J) is the concept that explains the minimum detectable difference. So when the actual difference between Coke and Pepsi exceeds this threshold, people can tell them apart. 

So, the answer should be J: Difference threshold.

The ability to detect the difference between Coke and Pepsi relates to the concept of the difference threshold, which is the minimum detectable difference in stimuli.

Answer: J
