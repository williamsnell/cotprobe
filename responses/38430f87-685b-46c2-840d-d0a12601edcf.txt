Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about ring theory, and I need to figure out whether the two statements are true, false, or not given. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the two statements are:

1. A ring homomorphism is one-to-one if and only if the kernel is {0}.
2. Q is an ideal in R.

The options are from A to I, each combining a truth value for statement 1 and statement 2. I need to determine which option is correct.

Starting with Statement 1: "A ring homomorphism is one-to-one if and only if the kernel is {0}." 

I remember that in ring theory, a ring homomorphism is injective (one-to-one) if and only if its kernel is trivial, meaning it contains only the zero element. This is similar to group theory, where the kernel being trivial implies the homomorphism is injective. So, the statement seems correct. Therefore, Statement 1 is True.

Now, Statement 2: "Q is an ideal in R." 

Wait, Q here is likely referring to the set of rational numbers. But in the context of ring theory, does Q (rationals) form an ideal in R, where R could be the ring of integers, rationals, or reals? 

An ideal must satisfy two main properties: it's an additive subgroup, and it's closed under multiplication by any element from the ring R. 

If R is the ring of integers (Z), then Q is not an ideal because the integers are not a subset of Q, and Q isn't closed under addition (for example, 1/2 + 1/2 = 1, which is in Q, but wait, that's still in Q. Hmm, but actually, Q is a field, and the only ideals in a field are {0} and the field itself. So if R is a field like Q, then Q is an ideal because the ideal would be the entire ring itself. But if R is a larger ring, like the real numbers, then Q is not an ideal because, for example, multiplying a rational number by an irrational number gives an irrational, which is not in Q.

Wait, but the question just says R. If R is Q, then Q is the entire ring, so it's a trivial ideal. But if R is a different ring, like Z, then Q can't be an ideal because Q isn't a subset of Z. Or if R is a ring that contains Q as a subset, like R being the real numbers, then Q isn't an ideal because it's not closed under multiplication by elements of R (like multiplying by √2, which is in R but not in Q).

But the question doesn't specify what R is. So without knowing the context of R, we can't definitively say whether Q is an ideal in R. Therefore, the statement is not given enough information. So Statement 2 is Not Given.

Wait, but wait another thought. Maybe the question is referring to R as the real numbers. In that case, Q is not an ideal in R because, for example, 1/2 is in Q, and multiplying by √2 (which is in R) gives √2/2, which is not in Q. So Q isn't closed under multiplication by elements of R. Therefore, if R is the real numbers, then Statement 2 is False. But if R is Q itself, then Statement 2 is True because Q is a ring and the entire ring is an ideal of itself.

But since the question doesn't specify what R is, we can't assume it's Q. So the statement is Not Given because it depends on R's definition. Alternatively, if the question is implying R is a specific ring, like the integers or reals, then it's False. But without context, it's Not Given.

Wait, but another angle: Maybe R is the ring of integers, and Q is not an ideal in Z. So Statement 2 is False. But without knowing R, it's not given. Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a general R. So, the statement is making a general claim that Q is an ideal in R, which isn't necessarily true unless R is Q. So, in general, without knowing R, the statement is Not Given. Therefore, Statement 2 is Not Given.

So putting it together: Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is Not Given. Therefore, the answer should be E: True, Not Given.

The first statement is true because a ring homomorphism is injective if and only if its kernel is trivial. The second statement is not given because whether Q is an ideal in R depends on the specific ring R, which is not provided.
