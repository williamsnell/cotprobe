Okay, so I've got this question about the capital of a firm. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, I remember from my accounting classes that the capital of a firm is related to the accounting equation. The equation is Assets = Liabilities + Equity. Oh wait, equity is also known as capital, right?

So the question gives me the total assets as $240,000 and total liabilities as $100,000. I need to find the capital, which is the equity part. So I think I can rearrange the equation to solve for equity. That would be Equity = Assets - Liabilities.

Let me plug in the numbers. Assets are $240,000 and liabilities are $100,000. So subtracting those gives me $240,000 minus $100,000, which equals $140,000. Wait, but the question also mentions an income of $40,000 for the year. Does that affect the capital? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. 

I think income is part of the equity because it increases the retained earnings, which is a component of equity. But wait, the question is asking for the capital of the firm, which is the total equity. So if the income is $40,000, does that mean we add it to the previous equity? Or is the income already accounted for in the assets and liabilities?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The accounting equation doesn't directly include income; instead, income affects equity through the profit or loss for the year. So if the income is $40,000, that would increase the equity by $40,000. But in the equation, is that already considered in the assets? Or am I supposed to calculate it separately?

Wait, no, the initial calculation I did was $140,000, which is the equity before considering income. But since income is earned during the year, it would add to the equity. So the total capital would be the initial equity plus the income. So $140,000 plus $40,000 equals $180,000. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see $180,000 as the first option. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, H is $180,000. So that would be the correct answer. But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The question says the income is $40,000 for one year, so that would be the net income after expenses. So in the accounting equation, the net income increases the equity by that amount. So the capital, which is the equity, is $140,000 plus $40,000, totaling $180,000. So the answer should be H.

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the terms. Sometimes people refer to capital as the initial investment, but in this context, I think it's referring to the equity, which includes retained earnings as well. So yes, including the income makes the capital $180,000.

The capital of the firm is calculated using the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Equity. Rearranging this equation gives Equity = Assets - Liabilities. Plugging in the values, Equity = $240,000 - $100,000 = $140,000. Since the firm's income for the year is $40,000, this increases the equity, making the total capital $140,000 + $40,000 = $180,000. 

Answer: H
