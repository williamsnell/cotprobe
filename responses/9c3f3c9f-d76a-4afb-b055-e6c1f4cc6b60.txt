Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the Safavids drew the ire of the Ottoman and Mughal Empires. The question is referring to a letter from Sultan Selim I to Shah Ismail I in 1514. From the passage, it talks about fatwas and consensus among Sunni scholars. It mentions "extirpation, extermination, and expulsion of evil innovation," and quotes the Prophet as saying those who introduce innovations should be expelled. 

So the key here is understanding what the Safavids did that was seen as an "evil innovation." The Safavids were a Shia dynasty, right? They established Shia Islam as the state religion, which was different from the Sunni majority in the regions they were active. The Ottomans were Sunni, so this religious difference must have been a significant issue.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. Option A talks about military advancement, but the letter seems more focused on religious reasons rather than military prowess. Option B mentions being between two expansionists; I'm not sure about their exact locations, but the main issue seems more about religion. Option C is about polytheism, which doesn't fit because both Safavids and their opponents were Muslim. Option D says they were accused of blasphemy. Blasphemy is a strong term, but maybe it's about their Shia practices being seen as heretical by Sunnis. Option E is about Ismail proclaiming himself Caliph. I don't recall that being the main issue; the conflict was more about religious sects. Option F is about refusing tributes, which might be a part, but the letter seems to focus on religious reasons. Option G is about a different sect of Islam, which makes sense because Safavids were Shia, and Ottomans were Sunni. Option H is about allies with enemies, but the main issue is religious. Option I is rejecting central tenets, which could be similar to G. Option J is about enslaving Christians, which I don't think was the primary reason.

So, the passage mentions "evil innovation," which likely refers to the Safavid promotion of Shia Islam. The Ottomans and Mughals, being Sunni, saw this as a heretical innovation. Therefore, the main reason was their different sect. So the answer is G.

The Safavids were primarily targeted by the Ottoman and Mughal Empires due to their promotion of Shia Islam, which was seen as an "evil innovation" by the Sunni majority. This religious difference was the main cause of conflict, as the letter highlights the need to expel heretical innovations. 

Answer: G
