Okay, so I have this question about the killing/letting die distinction and its moral relevance. The question is asking whether we're equally to blame for allowing people in Third World countries to starve as we would be for another action. The options are A through J, each presenting a different scenario.

First, I need to understand what the killing/letting die distinction means. From what I remember, this is a concept in ethics where there's a difference between actively killing someone and letting them die by not acting. The idea is that sometimes people think it's worse to kill someone directly than to fail to save them, but some argue that the distinction might not hold in all cases.

The question is whether allowing people to starve (letting die) is as morally blameworthy as another action. The options are all different ways someone might be causing harm, either directly or through inaction.

Let me go through each option to see which one best matches the scenario of whether the distinction is morally relevant.

Option A: Killing them by blocking access to clean water. That's an active actionâ€”blocking access. So if we block clean water, we're directly causing their deaths. The original scenario is about letting them starve by not acting, so this is more about direct killing.

Option B: Killing them by sending poisoned food. Again, this is a direct action. Sending poisoned food would be an active killing, similar to option A.

Option C: Refusing to share agricultural technology. This could be seen as inaction or active refusal. If we have technology that could help them produce food but choose not to share it, that might be a form of letting them die by omission.

Option D: Withholding medicine they need. Similar to C, this is about not providing something necessary, leading to their death. So it's a form of letting die.

Option E: Exploiting resources without fair compensation. This seems more about economic injustice, but it's a direct action that could contribute to their hardship, perhaps indirectly causing their death.

Option F: Denying fair trade opportunities. This is about economic policies that prevent them from trading fairly, which could lead to starvation. Again, an action that contributes to their death through economic means.

Option G: Depriving them of knowledge to produce food. Not sharing knowledge could prevent them from growing their own food, leading to starvation. This is more about information as a resource.

Option H: Imposing economic sanctions leading to food shortages. Sanctions can cause severe hardship, so this is an action that directly contributes to their starvation.

Option I: Depriving land for farming. Taking their land would prevent them from growing food, leading to starvation. This is a direct action.

Option J: Refusing money to purchase food. If they can't buy food because we won't give them money, that's letting them die through financial withholding.

The question is about whether the distinction between killing and letting die is relevant. So, if the scenario is about letting die (allowing starvation), which of these options is similar in moral blame as killing.

I think the point is to find an action that is as blameworthy as letting someone die, perhaps because it's a direct cause. So, if we block access to clean water (A), that's directly causing death, similar to killing. Alternatively, if we are actively doing something that leads to their death, like sending poisoned food (B), that's also direct.

But the question is whether allowing them to starve is as bad as another action. So, if the other action is similarly blameworthy, then the distinction might not hold because both would be seen as equally wrong.

Looking at the options, options A and B are direct actions leading to death. So, if someone allows starvation, are they as blameworthy as someone who directly causes death through these actions?

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is H or J, where the action is more about policy or refusal that directly leads to starvation, making it similar to letting die but perhaps considered a form of killing through inaction.

Wait, but the question is whether the killing/letting die distinction is morally relevant. So, if someone argues that it's not morally relevant, then allowing them to starve (letting die) would be as blameworthy as actively killing. So, the correct option would be one where the action is as blameworthy as letting die.

Looking back, option A is about blocking clean water, which is a direct action. If you block their access, you're causing their death. Similarly, letting them starve by not helping is letting die. So, if the distinction isn't morally relevant, then allowing them to starve is as bad as actively blocking water.

But the question is phrased as whether we are equally to blame for allowing them to starve as we would be for [which action]. So, the action that is as blameworthy as letting them starve.

I think the answer is A: killing them by blocking access to clean water. Because if you block clean water, you're directly causing their death, similar to how letting them starve by not providing aid could be seen as equally blameworthy if the distinction doesn't hold.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is J: refusing money to purchase food. Because that's a refusal to act, similar to letting die. But J is more about not giving money, which is a refusal, so maybe it's more about letting die, not direct killing.

Wait, the question is about whether allowing them to starve is as blameworthy as another action. So, the other action should be one where we are actively causing their death, so that the two are equally blameworthy regardless of the distinction.

So, the correct answer would be A: killing by blocking clean water. Because if the distinction isn't relevant, then allowing them to starve (letting die) is as bad as actively blocking their access to clean water.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The question is whether the distinction is morally relevant. If it's not, then allowing them to starve is as bad as actively killing them. So, the scenario would be whether we are as blameworthy for letting them die as for, say, actively killing them in another way.

Therefore, the correct option would be one where the action is a form of killing, making the two scenarios (letting die vs. killing) equally blameworthy if the distinction doesn't hold.

So, the answer is A: killing by blocking access to clean water.

The question asks whether the killing/letting die distinction is morally relevant by comparing allowing people to starve (letting die) to another action. The key is to identify an action that is as blameworthy as letting die, assuming the distinction doesn't hold.

- **Option A** involves actively blocking access to clean water, which directly causes death. If the distinction between killing and letting die is irrelevant, allowing starvation could be as blameworthy as this direct action.
- **Option B** involves sending poisoned food, another direct form of killing.
- **Options C, D, F, G, H, I, and J** describe actions that contribute to starvation but are more about omission or indirect harm, not direct killing.

The most fitting answer is **A**, as blocking clean water access is a direct killing action, making it equally blameworthy as letting die if the distinction is irrelevant.

Answer: A
