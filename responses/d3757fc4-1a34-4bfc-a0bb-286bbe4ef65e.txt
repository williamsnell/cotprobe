Question:

Which of the following statements concerning a sarcomere of a striated muscle (such as skeletal muscle) is correct?

Options:

A: The A band shortens during muscle contraction.
B: During contraction H zones become elongated.
C: The proteins troponin and tropomyosin constitute the thick and thin filaments, respectively.
D: Myosin filaments are found in the I band.
E: Troponin and tropomyosin are located in the H zone.
F: Tropomyosin binds to myosin, blocking the actin-binding site.
G: The thin filaments are composed entirely of myosin.
H: In the relaxed position tropomyosin impedes myosin's access to the binding site of actin.

Okay, so I have this question about sarcomeres in striated muscles, and I need to figure out which statement is correct. I'm a bit rusty on my muscle physiology, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that a sarcomere is the basic functional unit of muscle fibers. It's the repeating segment that gives muscles their striated appearance. The structure of a sarcomere includes light and dark bands, which correspond to the I bands and A bands, respectively. The H zone is in the middle of the A band, and the M line is at the center of the sarcomere.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says the A band shortens during contraction. Wait, the A band is the dark band, which is made up of thick filaments (myosin) and doesn't change much during contraction. Actually, during contraction, the I bands (light) get shorter because the thin filaments slide into the A band, making the H zone disappear. So A might be incorrect.

Option B states that during contraction, H zones become elongated. Hmm, the H zone is the light area in the middle of the A band. When the muscle contracts, the H zone should get smaller, not longer. Because the thin filaments move into the A band, so the H zone disappears. So B is probably wrong.

Option C claims that troponin and tropomyosin are the thick and thin filaments. That doesn't sound right. I think the thick filaments are myosin, and the thin filaments are actin. Troponin and tropomyosin are proteins associated with the thin filaments. Troponin is a complex that includes tropomyosin, which binds to actin. So C is incorrect because it's mixing up the filaments with these proteins.

Option D says myosin filaments are found in the I band. Wait, myosin is the thick filament and is part of the A band, not the I band. The I band is made of thin filaments (actin). So D is incorrect.

Option E states that troponin and tropomyosin are in the H zone. No, the H zone is part of the A band and is made of thick filaments. The thin filaments with troponin and tropomyosin are in the I band and part of the A band as well. E doesn't seem right.

Option F claims tropomyosin binds to myosin, blocking the actin-binding site. Wait, I thought tropomyosin is part of the thin filament. It binds to actin and covers the binding sites until the muscle contracts. When the muscle relaxes, tropomyosin is shifted, allowing myosin to bind. So maybe F is correct because it states tropomyosin blocks the actin-binding site. But wait, I thought it's the other way around: tropomyosin is on actin, not myosin. Let me think again. Tropomyosin is along the actin filaments. When the muscle is relaxed, tropomyosin covers the actin's binding sites for myosin. So when contraction starts, tropomyosin moves, revealing the binding sites. So F says tropomyosin binds to myosin, which I don't think is accurate. Maybe F is incorrect.

Option G says thin filaments are entirely myosin. No, myosin is the thick filament. The thin filaments are made of actin. So G is wrong.

Option H states that in the relaxed position, tropomyosin impedes myosin's access to the actin-binding site. Yes, that's correct. In the relaxed state, tropomyosin covers the actin's sites, preventing myosin from binding. So H is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought about option F. Let me clarify: tropomyosin is on actin, not myosin. So F says tropomyosin binds to myosin, which would be incorrect. So H is correct because it correctly describes the relaxed state.

So looking back, the correct statements are H and possibly F, but F is incorrect. So H is correct.

The correct answer is H. In the relaxed position, tropomyosin impedes myosin's access to the actin-binding site, which aligns with the described mechanism of muscle contraction and relaxation.

Answer: H
