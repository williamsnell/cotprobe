Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to understand what it's asking. Alright, it's about an automobile drag racer. The car has acceleration 'a' and an instantaneous velocity 'v'. The tires have a radius r0, and they're not slipping. The question is asking about the initial velocity in the rotating system that will make a hockey puck appear motionless in the fixed system. Hmm, that's a bit confusing, but let me break it down.

First, I remember that when a car accelerates, the tires rotate without slipping. That means the point of contact with the ground is instantaneously at rest relative to the ground. So, the no-slip condition implies that the linear velocity of the center of the tire (which is the car's velocity) is equal to the angular velocity multiplied by the radius. So, v = ω r0. That makes sense because if the tire were spinning too fast, it would slip, and too slow, it wouldn't move.

Now, the problem mentions a hockey puck. I'm not entirely sure how the puck is involved. Maybe the puck is placed on the car's tire or something. Wait, perhaps the puck is being observed in two different reference frames: the rotating system (like the car's frame) and the fixed system (the ground). The question is about making the puck appear motionless in the fixed system. So, from the ground's perspective, the puck isn't moving. That must mean that the puck's velocity in the fixed system is zero.

Wait, but how does the puck's motion relate to the car's acceleration and the tire's rotation? Maybe the puck is placed on the tire as the car accelerates. So, initially, the puck is moving with the car's velocity, and as the car accelerates, the puck might experience some motion relative to the car or the ground.

I think I need to consider the velocities in both frames. Let's denote the initial velocity of the puck in the rotating system as u. Since the car is accelerating, the puck's velocity in the fixed system would be a combination of the car's velocity and the puck's velocity relative to the car. But wait, no—actually, if the puck is on the tire, its velocity in the fixed system is the same as the car's velocity because the tire isn't slipping. But that's not considering any other motion.

Wait, maybe the puck is on a rotating platform. Oh, wait, perhaps the puck is placed on the tire's edge. So, in the rotating frame of the car, the puck has a velocity relative to the car's center. Let me think about this.

In the rotating frame (attached to the car), the puck would have a velocity due to the tire's rotation. The tire's angular velocity is ω, so the puck's velocity relative to the car's center would be ω r0. But since the car is also accelerating, from the fixed frame, the puck's velocity is the sum of the car's velocity and the relative velocity due to rotation.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to model this.

The car is moving with velocity v(t) = a t (assuming initial velocity is zero, but maybe not). Wait, the problem says the car has acceleration a and instantaneous velocity v, so v = a t. But the question is about the initial velocity in the rotating system. Hmm, perhaps the initial condition is when t=0, so v=0, but that doesn't make sense because then the car isn't moving. Maybe the initial velocity is non-zero, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the puck's velocity in the rotating frame and how it appears in the fixed frame. The goal is to find the initial velocity in the rotating system (maybe the puck is initially moving with the car's rotation) such that, when transformed to the fixed system, the puck appears stationary.

Wait, let's think in terms of reference frames. The rotating frame is the car's frame, which is non-inertial because the car is accelerating. So, when transforming velocities from the rotating frame to the fixed frame, we need to consider the acceleration of the rotating frame.

In the rotating frame, the puck has some velocity u. The fixed frame observes the puck's velocity as v_p = v_car + u + a_rot * something. Wait, I'm not recalling the exact formula.

Wait, the general transformation from a rotating frame (non-inertial) to the fixed frame involves adding the velocity of the rotating frame's origin plus the relative velocity, plus the velocity due to the frame's rotation. So, if the rotating frame has origin moving at velocity v_car (which is a t), and the frame is rotating with angular velocity ω, then the velocity of the puck in the fixed frame is:

v_p = v_car + u + ω × r_p,

where r_p is the position vector of the puck relative to the rotating frame's origin (the car's center, perhaps). Wait, but if the puck is on the tire's edge, r_p is r0 in the radial direction, so when you take the cross product ω × r_p, you get ω r0 in the tangential direction.

Wait, but in this case, the car is moving forward, so v_car is along the x-axis, and the rotation is about the same point, so maybe it's simpler.

Wait, perhaps the puck is placed at a distance R from the car's center, not r0. But the tire's radius is r0. Hmm, the problem doesn't specify, but looking at the options, some have R and others r0. So maybe R is the position of the puck relative to the car's center. So when the car is accelerating, the puck's velocity in the rotating frame is u, and in the fixed frame, it's v_p = v_car + u + ω × R.

Wait, but ω is related to v_car because the tire isn't slipping. So, v_car = ω r0 → ω = v_car / r0.

So, substituting ω into the velocity equation, we get v_p = v_car + u + (v_car / r0) × R.

Now, the problem states that the puck appears motionless in the fixed system, so v_p = 0.

So, 0 = v_car + u + (v_car / r0) * R.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the direction. Let me think about the coordinate system. The car is moving along the x-axis, and the tire's rotation is about the same point. The puck's position relative to the car is R in the radial direction, say along the x-axis (if it's on the front of the car) or in the tangential direction. Wait, maybe I should model it as the puck being on the edge of the tire, so its position relative to the car's center is R. So, when the car is moving, the puck is moving with the car's velocity and also rotating around the center.

Wait, but the cross product would involve the direction. Let's model it as the puck being on the right side of the car, so R is along the x-axis. Then, ω is about the z-axis, so the cross product ω × R would point in the y-direction. But the car's velocity is along the x-axis, and u is the velocity of the puck in the rotating frame.

Wait, this seems complicated because the cross product would introduce a perpendicular velocity component. But maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the puck is placed such that its velocity in the rotating frame is along the direction of the car's motion, so we can neglect the cross product term or consider it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler. Let me think again.

We have the car accelerating with acceleration a, so its instantaneous velocity is v = a t (assuming it starts from rest). The tire's radius is r0, and it's not slipping, so ω = v / r0.

The problem is about the initial velocity in the rotating system. So, perhaps the initial condition is at t=0, when the car is just starting to move. So, initial car velocity v_initial = 0, but then it starts to accelerate. But that doesn't make sense because then the puck's initial velocity in the rotating frame would be zero as well, making v_p =0. That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the puck is placed on the tire when the car is already moving with velocity v. Then, in the rotating frame, the puck's initial velocity is u. The goal is to find u such that in the fixed frame, the puck's velocity is zero.

Wait, but how does the puck's motion in the rotating frame relate to the car's acceleration? Hmm, maybe I should consider the equation of motion in the rotating frame.

In the rotating frame (attached to the car), the puck experiences the car's acceleration a (which is the linear acceleration) and the centrifugal acceleration due to the rotation. So, the equation of motion would be:

u'' = -a (since the car is accelerating forward, in the rotating frame, the acceleration is opposite) plus the centrifugal acceleration term, which is -ω² R (where R is the distance from the car's center to the puck). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the velocity transformation. The velocity of the puck in the fixed frame is the car's velocity plus the puck's velocity relative to the car. But the car's velocity is v = ω r0, since no slipping. So, v_car = ω r0.

If the puck's velocity relative to the car (in the rotating frame) is u, then in the fixed frame, v_p = v_car + u.

Wait, but the rotating frame is non-inertial, so we might need to account for the frame's acceleration. So, in the rotating frame, the puck's acceleration is u'' plus the acceleration of the rotating frame.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to write the velocity transformation again.

In the fixed frame, the puck's velocity is v_p = v_car + u, where u is the velocity in the rotating frame. We want v_p =0, so 0 = v_car + u → u = -v_car.

But v_car = ω r0, so u = -ω r0.

Looking at the options, option E is 0.2 ω r0, H is 0.8 ω r0, I is 0.6 ω r0. F is 1.0 ω r0. So, if u = -ω r0, then the magnitude is ω r0. But that's option F. However, the initial velocity in the rotating system is a vector. But the options are given as scalar multiples. So, perhaps the answer is F: 1.0 ω r0.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The problem states that the puck appears motionless in the fixed system. So, the puck's velocity in the fixed frame is zero. That means v_p =0 = v_car + u + (other terms?).

Wait, maybe I'm missing something about the direction. If the puck is on the edge of the tire, its velocity relative to the car is tangential, not along the direction of motion. So, perhaps the velocity u is tangential, and v_car is along the x-axis. Then, the total velocity in the fixed frame would be v_car (along x) plus u (along y or negative x, depending on the direction of rotation). Wait, but if the car is moving forward, the tire rotates clockwise (assuming standard), so the puck's velocity relative to the car is to the left (if on the right side of the car) or to the right if on the left side.

Wait, perhaps the puck is placed on the tire such that in the rotating frame, its velocity is directed opposite to the car's motion. So, u is in the opposite direction to v_car. Then, v_p = v_car + u. To make v_p zero, u must be -v_car. So, u = -v_car = -ω r0.

So, the initial velocity in the rotating frame is -ω r0. The options have F as 1.0 ω r0, but that's positive. So, perhaps the answer is F, but with a negative sign, but the options don't specify direction, just magnitude. So, the initial velocity's magnitude is ω r0, which would be option F.

Wait, but looking back at the options, F is 1.0 ω r0. So, that seems to fit. But let me make sure I didn't miss any other terms.

Wait, the problem mentions that the car has acceleration a and instantaneous velocity v. So, v = a t, but when considering the initial velocity in the rotating system, perhaps t=0, so v=0? That doesn't make sense because then the car isn't moving, and the puck would have to have u=0 to be stationary. But the options don't have zero, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the puck is placed on the car when it's already moving, so the initial velocity in the rotating frame is u, and we need to find u such that the puck's velocity in the fixed frame is zero at that moment.

So, v_p = v_car + u. Setting this to zero, u = -v_car. Since v_car = ω r0, u = -ω r0. The magnitude is ω r0, so the initial velocity in the rotating frame is -ω r0, but the options list F as 1.0 ω r0, which would be the magnitude.

Wait, but if the car is accelerating, then the velocity in the fixed frame is v_car = a t, but the initial velocity (t=0) would be zero. That can't be right because then the puck would have to have u=0 to appear stationary. But that's not an option, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the problem isn't about the initial velocity at t=0, but the initial velocity in the rotating frame relative to the car's acceleration. Hmm, perhaps I need to consider the equation of motion in the rotating frame.

In the rotating frame, the puck's acceleration would be the acceleration of the frame plus the relative acceleration. So, the equation would be:

u'' = a (since the car is accelerating forward, in the rotating frame, it's a pseudo-force in the opposite direction) plus any centrifugal terms if the rotation changes.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simpler, and the initial velocity in the rotating frame is such that the puck's velocity in the fixed frame cancels out the car's velocity. So, u = -v_car. As before, leading to u = -ω r0, so the magnitude is ω r0, which is option F.

But looking at the options, option F is 1.0 ω r0. So, I think that's the answer.

The problem involves determining the initial velocity of a hockey puck in the rotating frame of a drag racer's car such that the puck appears motionless in the fixed (ground) frame. The car accelerates with acceleration \(a\) and has an instantaneous velocity \(v\), with tires of radius \(r_0\) that are not slipping. The no-slip condition implies that the car's velocity \(v\) is related to the tire's angular velocity \(\omega\) by \(v = \omega r_0\).

In the rotating frame (attached to the car), the puck's velocity is denoted as \(u\). To make the puck appear motionless in the fixed frame, its velocity in the fixed frame must be zero. The velocity transformation from the rotating frame to the fixed frame is given by:

\[
v_p = v_{\text{car}} + u
\]

Setting \(v_p = 0\) to satisfy the condition of the puck being motionless in the fixed frame, we find:

\[
0 = v_{\text{car}} + u \implies u = -v_{\text{car}}
\]

Since \(v_{\text{car}} = \omega r_0\), the initial velocity in the rotating frame is:

\[
u = -\omega r_0
\]

The magnitude of this velocity is \(\omega r_0\). Among the given options, the closest match is **F: 1.0 \(\omega r_0\)**, which corresponds to the magnitude of the initial velocity in the rotating frame.

**Answer: F**
