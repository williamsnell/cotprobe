Question:

A physician is conducting a retrospective review of a trial involving the use of Drug X in patients with a specific disease. It is known that Drug X is associated with an increased probability of cancer in patients who use the drug. A total of 600 individuals with a specific disease were included in the trial. Of the participants, 200 individuals received Drug X and 400 individuals did not receive it. One hundred individuals who received Drug X died of a particular type of cancer and 100 individuals who did not receive the drug died of the same type of cancer. Based on these data, which of the following is the relative risk of death from this type of cancer in individuals who take Drug X as compared with individuals who do not take Drug X?

Options:

A: Individuals who take Drug X have two times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
B: Individuals who take Drug X have four times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
C: Individuals who take Drug X have three times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
D: Individuals who take Drug X have six times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
E: Individuals who do not take Drug X have three times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
F: Individuals who take Drug X have half the risk of dying from this type of cancer
G: Individuals who take Drug X have an equal risk of dying from this type of cancer
H: Individuals who do not take Drug X have two times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
I: Individuals who take Drug X have five times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
J: Individuals who take Drug X have zero risk of dying from this type of cancer

Okay, so I've got this question about relative risk, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

Alright, the scenario is a physician reviewing a trial involving Drug X. Drug X is known to increase the probability of cancer in patients. There were 600 individuals in the trial. 200 received Drug X, and 400 didn't. Out of these, 100 on Drug X died of a specific cancer, and 100 who didn't take it also died of the same cancer.

The question is asking for the relative risk of death from this type of cancer in individuals taking Drug X compared to those who don't. The options are A to J, each giving a different risk ratio.

Hmm, relative risk is calculated as the risk in the exposed group divided by the risk in the non-exposed group. So I need to find the risk (or probability) of dying from cancer for both groups first.

Let me break it down.

For Drug X group:
Number of people who died: 100
Total in group: 200
So the risk (probability) is 100/200 = 0.5 or 50%.

For the non-Drug X group:
Number of people who died: 100
Total in group: 400
So the risk here is 100/400 = 0.25 or 25%.

Now, relative risk is Drug X risk divided by non-Drug X risk. So that's 0.5 / 0.25.

Let me compute that. 0.5 divided by 0.25 equals 2. So the relative risk is 2. That means people taking Drug X have twice the risk of dying from this cancer compared to those who don't take it.

Looking at the options, option A says individuals who take Drug X have two times the risk. So A should be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I calculate the relative risk correctly? Yes, because relative risk is about comparing the two groups. The numerator is the exposed group (Drug X), and the denominator is the unexposed group. So 50% divided by 25% is indeed 2. So relative risk is 2.0, which is two times the risk.

Another way to think about it: for every person not taking the drug, their risk is 25%, while for those taking it, it's 50%. So Drug X users have double the risk. That makes sense.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. So the answer should be A.

The relative risk is calculated by dividing the risk of death in the Drug X group by the risk in the non-Drug X group. The risk for Drug X users is 50% (100/200), and for non-users, it's 25% (100/400). Dividing these gives a relative risk of 2, meaning Drug X users have twice the risk. 

Answer: A
