Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this problem about E. coli cells and calculating the number of H+ ions in a single cell. Let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

First, the question says the E. coli cell is cylindrical with a diameter of 1.0 micrometer and a length of 2.0 micrometers. It also mentions that the cell is 80% water. The intracellular pH is 6.4, and I need to find the number of H+ ions.

Hmm, I remember that pH is a measure of the hydrogen ion concentration, [H+]. The formula is pH = -log[H+], so I can rearrange that to find [H+] = 10^(-pH). Let me calculate that first.

So, pH is 6.4. That means [H+] is 10^(-6.4). Wait, what's 10^-6.4? I think 10^-6 is 1e-6, which is 0.000001. But 10^-6.4 is a bit less than that. Let me calculate it more accurately. 10^0.4 is approximately 2.51189. So 10^-6.4 is 1/(10^6 * 10^0.4) ≈ 1/(1e6 * 2.51189) ≈ 1/(2.51189e6) ≈ 3.98e-7 M. So [H+] ≈ 3.98e-7 mol/L.

Wait, but wait—I think I might have miscalculated. Let me double-check. 10^0.4 is around 2.5118864315... So 10^(-6.4) = 1/(10^6 * 10^0.4) = 1/(2.5118864315e6) ≈ 3.98e-7 M. Yeah, that's right.

Next, I need to find the volume of the E. coli cell. Since it's cylindrical, the volume formula is V = π r² h. The diameter is 1.0 μm, so the radius r is 0.5 μm. The length h is 2.0 μm.

Let me compute the volume. V = π * (0.5e-6 m)^2 * 2e-6 m. Wait, because 1 micrometer is 1e-6 meters. So r = 0.5e-6 m, h=2e-6 m.

Calculating each part:

r squared is (0.5e-6)^2 = 0.25e-12 m².

Multiply by h: 0.25e-12 * 2e-6 = 0.5e-18 m³.

Then multiply by π: π * 0.5e-18 ≈ 1.5708e-18 m³. Wait, because π is approximately 3.1416. So 3.1416 * 0.5 = 1.5708. So V ≈ 1.5708e-18 m³.

But wait, sometimes in these problems, they might use cubic micrometers. Let me check: since the dimensions are in micrometers, 1 micrometer is 1e-6 meters, so 1 micrometer^3 is (1e-6 m)^3 = 1e-18 m³. So the volume in m³ is correct as 1.5708e-18 m³.

Now, the cell is 80% water. Does that affect the calculation? Hmm. Wait, I'm trying to find the number of H+ ions in the cell. Since water is a major component, but the concentration of H+ is determined by pH regardless of the amount of water. Because pH is a ratio, so maybe the percentage water doesn't directly affect the concentration. Or perhaps it's about the volume. Wait, but the volume I've calculated is the total volume of the cell. So maybe the 80% is a distractor, or maybe I'm supposed to consider only the water part for H+? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, but wait—no, because H+ ions are present in the solution (the cytoplasm) regardless of the percentage of water. The pH is given for the intracellular solution, so the concentration of H+ is 3.98e-7 M in the entire cell volume. So the percentage water might not directly affect the calculation here. Maybe the 80% is just extra information that isn't needed for this particular calculation. So perhaps I can ignore it for this problem.

So the total volume is the entire cell volume, which is 1.5708e-18 m³. Now, the concentration of H+ is 3.98e-7 mol/m³. So the number of moles of H+ ions is concentration multiplied by volume.

Moles H+ = (3.98e-7 mol/m³) * (1.5708e-18 m³) ≈ 6.22e-25 mol.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately.

3.98e-7 * 1.5708e-18 = ?

3.98e-7 * 1.5708e-18 = (3.98 * 1.5708) * 1e-25.

3.98 * 1.5708 ≈ let's compute that.

3 * 1.5708 = 4.7124

0.98 * 1.5708 ≈ 1.5394

So total ≈ 4.7124 + 1.5394 ≈ 6.2518.

So 6.2518e-25 mol.

Now, each mole of H+ has Avogadro's number of ions, which is approximately 6.022e23 ions/mol.

So number of H+ ions = 6.2518e-25 mol * 6.022e23 ions/mol.

Let me compute that: 6.2518e-25 * 6.022e23 = (6.2518 * 6.022) * 1e-2.

6.2518 * 6.022 ≈ let's compute that.

6 * 6 = 36.

6 * 0.022 ≈ 0.132.

0.2518 * 6 ≈ 1.5108.

0.2518 * 0.022 ≈ ~0.0055.

Adding all: 36 + 0.132 + 1.5108 + 0.0055 ≈ approximately 37.6483.

But wait, perhaps a more accurate way: 6.2518 * 6.022.

Let me compute 6 * 6.022 = 36.132.

0.2518 * 6.022 ≈ 1.517.

So total is approximately 36.132 + 1.517 ≈ 37.649.

Multiply by 1e-2 (since 1e-25 * 1e23 = 1e-2), so 37.649 * 0.01 ≈ 0.37649.

Wait, that can't be right because 0.37649 is about 0.38, which would be 38 H+ ions. But looking at the options, the closest is E:302, which is way higher. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait a second. Let me recheck the calculations because 0.38 H+ ions doesn't make sense in this context. There must be a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents. Let me recalculate the moles.

Concentration [H+] is 3.98e-7 mol/m³.

Volume is 1.5708e-18 m³.

Moles = 3.98e-7 * 1.5708e-18 = ?

I think I might have miscalculated the exponents. Let's compute 3.98e-7 * 1.5708e-18.

In scientific notation, 3.98e-7 is 3.98 * 10^-7, and 1.5708e-18 is 1.5708 * 10^-18. Multiply them together: (3.98 * 1.5708) * 10^(-7 -18) = (3.98 * 1.5708) * 10^-25.

As before, 3.98 * 1.5708 ≈ 6.25, so 6.25e-25 mol.

Then, number of ions = 6.25e-25 mol * 6.022e23 ions/mol.

6.25e-25 * 6.022e23 = (6.25 * 6.022) * 10^(-25 +23) = (37.6375) * 10^-2 = 37.6375 * 0.01 = 0.376375.

Wait, that's about 0.376 ions. That's less than 1, which can't be right because you can't have a fraction of an ion in this context. Also, the options are all in the hundreds or thousands. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation. Where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the volume calculation. Let me recheck that.

The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = π r² h. The diameter is 1 μm, so radius is 0.5 μm. Length is 2 μm.

So V = π * (0.5)^2 * 2 = π * 0.25 * 2 = π * 0.5 ≈ 1.5708 μm³.

Wait a second, I think I messed up the units earlier. Because 1 μm³ is (1e-6 m)^3 = 1e-18 m³. So the volume in cubic meters is 1.5708e-18 m³. That part was correct.

So the moles are 3.98e-7 mol/m³ * 1.5708e-18 m³ = 6.25e-25 mol.

Multiply by Avogadro's number: 6.022e23 ions/mol.

So 6.25e-25 * 6.022e23 = (6.25 * 6.022) * 10^(-25 +23) = 37.6375 * 10^-2 = 0.376375.

That's about 0.376 H+ ions, which is less than one, which doesn't make sense. So there's something wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the [H+] calculation. Wait, pH is 6.4, so [H+] is 10^-6.4 M. Let me check that again.

Yes, 10^-6.4 is approximately 3.98e-7 M.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the cell's volume in liters instead of cubic meters. Because molarity is mol/L. So perhaps I should convert the volume from m³ to liters.

Wait, 1 m³ is 1000 liters. So 1e-3 m³ is 1 liter. Wait, no, 1 m³ = 1000 liters. So 1 liter is 0.001 m³, or 1e-3 m³.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the units again. The concentration is in mol/m³, and the volume is in m³, so multiplying gives mol. But another approach is to convert the volume to liters since molarity is mol/L.

So, the volume is 1.5708e-18 m³. To convert to liters: 1 m³ = 1000 L, so 1e-3 m³ = 1 L. Therefore, 1.5708e-18 m³ = 1.5708e-18 * 1000 L = 1.5708e-15 L.

Wait no, wait. Let me correct that. To convert from m³ to liters, since 1 m³ = 1000 liters, then 1 m³ = 1e3 liters. So 1 m³ = 1e3 L. Therefore, 1.5708e-18 m³ = 1.5708e-18 * 1e3 L = 1.5708e-15 L.

So now, the concentration is 3.98e-7 mol/L.

So moles H+ = (3.98e-7 mol/L) * (1.5708e-15 L) = 3.98e-7 * 1.5708e-15 = ?

3.98 * 1.5708 ≈ 6.25 as before. Exponents: 1e-7 * 1e-15 = 1e-22.

So 6.25e-22 mol.

Multiply by Avogadro's number: 6.022e23 ions/mol.

So 6.25e-22 * 6.022e23 = (6.25 * 6.022) * 10^( -22 +23 ) = (37.6375) * 10^1 = 376.375.

So approximately 376 H+ ions. But looking at the options, the closest is E: 302, F: 350, G: 250, etc. Wait, 376 isn't an option. The options are A:75, B:600, C:150, D:450, E:302, F:350, G:250, H:1000, I:50, J:800.

Hmm, 376 isn't there. So perhaps I made another mistake. Let me recheck my steps.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the volume calculation in liters. Let me recalculate the volume again.

Diameter = 1.0 μm, radius r = 0.5 μm, length h = 2.0 μm.

Volume V = π r² h = π * (0.5 μm)^2 * 2 μm = π * 0.25 μm² * 2 μm = π * 0.5 μm³ ≈ 1.5708 μm³.

Now, 1 μm³ is (1e-6 m)^3 = 1e-18 m³. So 1.5708 μm³ = 1.5708e-18 m³. Correct.

To convert to liters: 1 m³ = 1e3 L, so 1e-3 m³ = 1 L. So 1.5708e-18 m³ = 1.5708e-18 * 1e3 L = 1.5708e-15 L.

Yes, that's correct.

Concentration [H+] = 3.98e-7 mol/L.

Moles H+ = 3.98e-7 * 1.5708e-15 = ?

3.98e-7 is 3.98 * 1e-7.

1.5708e-15 is 1.5708 * 1e-15.

Multiply them: (3.98 * 1.5708) * (1e-7 * 1e-15) = 6.25 * 1e-22 = 6.25e-22 mol.

Then, multiply by Avogadro's number: 6.25e-22 * 6.022e23 = 6.25 * 6.022 * 1e1 = (37.6375) * 10 = 376.375 ≈ 376 H+ ions.

But the options don't have 376. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of [H+].

Wait, wait. Another thought: maybe the pH is given as 6.4, but that's the intracellular pH. Maybe I should consider the charge balance or the activity coefficients, but I think for this problem, we're assuming ideal behavior and using [H+] directly from pH.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is in the way I calculated the volume. Let me check if I used the correct radius.

Wait, diameter is 1.0 μm, so radius is 0.5 μm, correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the cell is considered as a sphere, but the question says it's cylindrical, so that's not it.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of 10^-6.4. Let me double-check that.

pH = 6.4 → [H+] = 10^-6.4.

I know that 10^-6 is 1e-6, and 10^-7 is 1e-7. So 10^-6.4 is between 1e-6 and 1e-7. Let me compute it accurately.

Using a calculator approach: log(3.98e-7) ≈ 6.4, because 10^6.4 ≈ 2.5118864315e6, so 1/2.5118864315e6 ≈ 3.98e-7. That's correct.

Hmm. So where is the mistake leading to 376 H+ ions, but no option provided? Let me check the options again. The options are A to J, with E being 302, F:350, which are nearby numbers.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation when multiplying 6.25e-22 by 6.022e23.

Wait, 6.25e-22 * 6.022e23 = 6.25 *6.022 * 1e1 = 37.6375 *10 = 376.375.

Yes, correct. So 376 H+ ions. But the options don't include that. So perhaps I made an error in the volume calculation.

Wait another thought: perhaps the cell is not 100% filled, but 80% water. Wait, the cell is 80% water, so perhaps the H+ ions are only in the water part, which is 80% of the total volume. Oh, wait, that's a crucial point I might have missed earlier.

So the total volume is 1.5708e-18 m³, but only 80% of that is water. So the volume of water is 0.8 * 1.5708e-18 m³ = 1.25664e-18 m³.

Wait, but then the H+ is in that 80% water volume. Or is the pH measured for the entire cell, which includes all components (like proteins, etc.)? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about this. In reality, the pH is a measure of the solution's hydrogen ion concentration, which would be in the water fraction. So perhaps I should only consider 80% of the total volume when calculating the number of H+ ions.

Wait, but wait. If the cell is 80% water, then the volume of water is 0.8 * total volume. So when calculating the concentration of H+ ions, which is in the water, the concentration would be the same as the cell's pH, but the volume to consider is the water volume.

Wait, but no. The pH is a measure that already accounts for the hydrogen ion concentration in the solution, which is based on the water present. So the [H+] is 3.98e-7 M in the entire cell's volume. Wait, no, because pH is measured in the aqueous solution, so the H+ is in the 80% water part.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think again.

The cell is 80% water by volume. So the volume of water is 0.8 * total volume. So when calculating H+ ions, since H+ comes from water dissociation, the concentration is in the water phase. So the number of H+ ions would be [H+] * volume of water.

So let's recalculate:

Volume of water = 0.8 * 1.5708e-18 m³ ≈ 1.25664e-18 m³.

[H+] = 3.98e-7 mol/m³.

Moles H+ = 3.98e-7 * 1.25664e-18 = ?

3.98e-7 * 1.25664e-18 = (3.98 * 1.25664) * 1e-25.

3.98 * 1.25664 ≈ let's compute that.

3 * 1.25664 = 3.76992.

0.98 * 1.25664 ≈ 1.2315.

Total ≈ 3.76992 + 1.2315 ≈ 5.00142.

So 5.00142e-25 mol.

Multiply by Avogadro's number: 5.00142e-25 * 6.022e23 = (5.00142 * 6.022) * 1e-2.

5.00142 *6.022 ≈ 30.11 (since 5*6=30, 0.00142*6≈0.0085, so 30.0085).

So 30.11 * 0.01 = 0.3011 H+ ions. That's even worse, less than one ion. That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption here. Maybe the 80% water doesn't affect the H+ calculation because the pH is given for the entire cell. Because pH is a measure of the hydrogen ion activity in the solution, regardless of the amount of water present. So the concentration is based on the entire volume of the cell, not just the water fraction.

In that case, the initial calculation of 376 H+ ions would be correct, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I shouldn't be using cubic meters but cubic centimeters or liters. Let me try calculating the volume in liters again.

Wait, 1 μm³ = 1e-18 m³ = 1e-21 L (since 1 m³ = 1e3 L, so 1e-18 m³ = 1e-18 * 1e3 L = 1e-15 L, which is 1 femtoliter). So 1.5708 μm³ = 1.5708e-15 L.

So [H+] is 3.98e-7 mol/L.

Moles H+ = 3.98e-7 mol/L * 1.5708e-15 L = 6.25e-22 mol.

Multiply by Avogadro's number: 6.25e-22 * 6.022e23 = 376.375 H+ ions.

Same result as before. So 376 H+ ions, but no option matches. Looking at the options, the closest higher option is F: 350, which is 350. Hmm, but 376 is between 350 and 450. But perhaps I made a calculation mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the volume calculation. Let me compute the volume again.

Wait, V = π r² h.

r = 0.5 μm, h = 2 μm.

So V = π * (0.5)^2 * 2 = π * 0.25 * 2 = π * 0.5 ≈ 1.5708 μm³.

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the diameter as 1 μm, so radius is 0.5 μm, correct. So volume is correct.

Another possibility: perhaps I should have used 2.0 μm as the diameter, making radius 1.0 μm. Wait, no, the question says the cell is 1.0 μm in diameter and 2.0 μm long. So diameter is 1, radius is 0.5.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the concentration of H+ is 10^-pH per liter, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the formula pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]) or something else, but I don't think that's necessary here.

Wait, perhaps the error is in considering the volume in m³. Let me try calculating everything in liters.

V = π * (0.5e-6 m)^2 * 2e-6 m.

Wait, 0.5e-6 m is radius, 2e-6 m is length.

V = π * (0.5e-6)^2 * 2e-6 = π * 0.25e-12 * 2e-6 = π * 0.5e-18 m³ = 1.5708e-18 m³.

Convert to liters: 1 m³ = 1e3 L, so 1e-3 m³ = 1 L. Therefore, 1.5708e-18 m³ = 1.5708e-18 * 1e3 L = 1.5708e-15 L.

So [H+] = 3.98e-7 mol/L.

Moles H+ = 3.98e-7 * 1.5708e-15 = 6.25e-22 mol.

Multiply by Avogadro's number: 6.25e-22 * 6.022e23 = 376.375 H+ ions.

Same result again. So why isn't 376 an option? Let me look at the options again:

A:75, B:600, C:150, D:450, E:302, F:350, G:250, H:1000, I:50, J:800.

Hmm, F is 350, which is close to 376. Perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the [H+]. Let me recheck that.

Wait, pH = 6.4 → [H+] = 10^-6.4 ≈ 3.98e-7 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the calculation expects me to use a rounded value for 10^0.4. 10^0.4 is approximately 2.5118864315, but perhaps for this problem, it's approximated to 2.51. So 1/2.51 ≈ 0.398, so [H+] ≈ 0.398e-6 ≈ 3.98e-7. Correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the cell is prolate, but the problem says to assume it's cylindrical, so the calculation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is in the initial volume calculation. Let me compute it again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used micrometers as meters instead of converting to meters. Wait, let's try that.

Wait, no, because 1 micrometer is 1e-6 meters. So I think the volume calculation was correct.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the volume in liters without converting from cubic meters. Let me try that.

Wait, the volume in m³ is 1.5708e-18 m³. To convert to liters, since 1 m³ = 1e3 liters, 1e-3 m³ = 1 liter. So 1.5708e-18 m³ = 1.5708e-15 liters.

So then, [H+] is 3.98e-7 mol/L.

Moles H+ = 3.98e-7 mol/L * 1.5708e-15 L = 6.25e-22 mol.

Multiply by Avogadro's number: 6.25e-22 * 6.022e23 = 376.375.

Hmm, same result.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should calculate the number of H+ ions per liter first, then multiply by the volume in liters.

[H+] = 3.98e-7 mol/L.

Avogadro's number: 6.022e23 ions/mol.

So ions per liter = 3.98e-7 * 6.022e23 ≈ 2.398e17 ions/L.

Then, the volume of the cell is 1.5708e-15 L.

So total ions = 2.398e17 ions/L * 1.5708e-15 L ≈ 3.763e2 ≈ 376 ions.

Same as before.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the cell is 80% water, so the H+ is only in that 80% volume. So the H+ concentration would be the same, but the volume is 80% of the total. Let me try that.

Volume of water: 0.8 * 1.5708e-18 m³ = 1.25664e-18 m³.

Moles H+ = 3.98e-7 * 1.25664e-18 = 5.0014e-25 mol.

Multiply by Avogadro's number: 5.0014e-25 * 6.022e23 ≈ 30.11 H+ ions. That's about 30 ions, which is close to option E:302. But 30 isn't close to 302. So that can't be right either.

Wait, perhaps I should not consider the 80% water, as the pH is given for the entire cell, including all components. So the initial calculation of 376 H+ ions stands, but it's not an option. So perhaps the given options have a typo, or I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should have used the formula for the volume of a cylinder in microliters instead of cubic meters. Let me try that.

1 μm³ = 1e-18 m³ = 1e-3 L (since 1 L = 1e-3 m³). Wait, no, that's not correct. 1 m³ = 1e3 L, so 1e-3 m³ = 1 L. Therefore, 1 μm³ = 1e-18 m³ = 1e-18 * 1e3 L = 1e-15 L = 1 femtoliter.

So the cell's volume is 1.5708 μm³ = 1.5708e-15 L.

So [H+] = 3.98e-7 mol/L.

Moles H+ = 3.98e-7 mol/L * 1.5708e-15 L = 6.25e-22 mol.

Multiply by Avogadro's number: 6.25e-22 * 6.022e23 = 376.375 H+ ions.

Same result again. So I'm confident that the correct answer should be approximately 376 H+ ions, but it's not among the options provided. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the way I calculated the volume. Let me compute it again.

Wait, perhaps I should use diameter in meters: diameter = 1.0 μm = 1e-6 m, radius = 0.5e-6 m.

Length = 2.0 μm = 2e-6 m.

Volume V = π * (0.5e-6 m)^2 * 2e-6 m.

Calculate each part:

(0.5e-6)^2 = 0.25e-12 m².

Multiply by 2e-6 m: 0.25e-12 * 2e-6 = 0.5e-18 m³.

Multiply by π: 0.5e-18 * π ≈ 1.5708e-18 m³.

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the cell is not a perfect cylinder but slightly different. But the problem says to assume it's cylindrical, so that's fine.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the way I converted the volume from m³ to liters. Let me recalculate that.

1 m³ = 1e3 liters, so 1e-3 m³ = 1 liter.

So 1.5708e-18 m³ = 1.5708e-18 * 1e3 liters = 1.5708e-15 liters.

Yes, correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of per cell, but I'm calculating correctly. Maybe I should check my calculation of 10^-6.4 again.

Wait, 10^-6.4 = 10^(-6 - 0.4) = 10^-6 * 10^-0.4.

10^-0.4 is approximately 0.3981, so 10^-6.4 ≈ 3.981e-7 M. Correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. The calculation leads me to approximately 376 H+ ions, but that's not an option. The closest option is F:350, which is 350. Maybe I should choose F, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is E:302 or F:350.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the multiplication:

6.25e-22 mol * 6.022e23 ions/mol.

6.25e-22 * 6.022e23 = 6.25 * 6.022 * 1e1.

Which is 6.25 *6.022 = 37.6375, multiplied by 10 gives 376.375.

So 376.375 H+ ions. So perhaps the intended answer is F:350, which is the closest. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the volume calculation, perhaps the length is 2 micrometers, so the volume is π*(0.5)^2*2=1.5708 μm³.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I considered the cell as a solid cylinder, but perhaps it's hollow, but the problem states it's cylindrical, so it's solid.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the cell's volume is in cubic micrometers, but I think I accounted for that correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is that the cell is 80% water by mass, not by volume. That would complicate things, but the problem states it's 80% water, but it's unclear whether it's by mass or volume. If it's by mass, the calculation would be more complex, but I think the problem implies by volume.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question expects me to ignore Avogadro's number and just calculate the concentration in terms of H+ per liter, then multiply by the volume in liters. Let me try that.

[H+] = 3.98e-7 mol/L = 3.98e-7 * 6.022e23 ions/L ≈ 2.398e17 ions/L.

Volume = 1.5708e-15 L.

Total H+ ions = 2.398e17 * 1.5708e-15 ≈ 376.375.

Same result.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is E:302. Let me see what pH would give 302 H+ ions.

If the number of H+ ions is 302, then moles H+ = 302 / 6.022e23 ≈ 5.016e-22 mol.

Volume is 1.5708e-18 m³.

[H+] = moles / volume = 5.016e-22 / 1.5708e-18 ≈ 3.19e-4 mol/m³ = 3.19e-4 M.

pH = -log(3.19e-4) ≈ 3.496. That's a much lower pH than given, so that's not matching.

Wait, if the number of ions is 350, moles = 350 / 6.022e23 ≈ 5.813e-22 mol.

[H+] = 5.813e-22 / 1.5708e-18 ≈ 3.7e-4 M.

pH = -log(3.7e-4) ≈ 3.43. Still not matching the given pH of 6.4.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial volume calculation. Let me compute the volume again using diameter in micrometers as length units.

Wait, the cell is 1.0 micrometer in diameter and 2.0 micrometers long. So V = π * (0.5 μm)^2 * 2 μm = π * 0.25 μm² * 2 μm = π * 0.5 μm³ ≈ 1.5708 μm³.

But 1 μm³ is 1e-18 m³, so 1.5708 μm³ = 1.5708e-18 m³.

So no mistake there.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the cell is 80% water, so the number of H+ ions is 20% of the total. But that doesn't make sense because H+ ions come from the water, which is 80% of the volume. Wait, no, the H+ concentration is in the water part, so the number of H+ ions should be based on the water volume.

Wait, let me try that again. Volume of water is 0.8 * 1.5708e-18 m³ = 1.25664e-18 m³.

Moles H+ = 3.98e-7 * 1.25664e-18 = 5.0014e-25 mol.

Multiply by Avogadro's number: 5.0014e-25 * 6.022e23 ≈ 30.11 H+ ions.

Which is about 30 ions, but that's not an option either. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Given that, I think the correct answer should be around 376, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is E:302, but I can't see how that would align with the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that 1.0 μm diameter is 1.0 micrometer, which is 1e-6 meters, so radius is 0.5e-6 meters. Length is 2e-6 meters. So volume is π*(0.5e-6)^2 * 2e-6 = π*(0.25e-12)*(2e-6) = π*(0.5e-18) = 1.5708e-18 m³. Correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should calculate the number of H+ ions per liter first, then multiply by the volume in liters.

[H+] = 3.98e-7 mol/L.

Ions per liter = 3.98e-7 * 6.022e23 ≈ 2.398e17 ions/L.

Volume = 1.5708e-15 L.

Total H+ ions = 2.398e17 * 1.5708e-15 ≈ 376.375.

Same as before.

I think I'm stuck. The calculation keeps leading me to approximately 376 H+ ions, but it's not among the options. The closest option is F:350. Perhaps the intended answer is F:350, considering possible rounding differences.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is in the way I calculated [H+]. Let me try using [H+] = 10^-6.4.

Wait, 10^0.4 is approximately 2.5118864315, so 10^-6.4 = 1/(10^6 * 10^0.4) = 1/(2.5118864315e6) ≈ 3.98e-7 M. Correct.

Hmm. I think I've tried all possible approaches and the answer should be around 376, but since it's not an option, I might have to choose the closest one, which is F:350. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E:302 due to a miscalculation elsewhere, but I can't see where that would come from.

To calculate the number of \( \text{H}^+ \) ions in a single E. coli cell, the following steps were taken:

1. **Cell Dimensions and Volume**:  
   The cell is cylindrical with a diameter of \( 1.0 \, \mu\text{m} \) (radius \( r = 0.5 \, \mu\text{m} \)) and a length of \( 2.0 \, \mu\text{m} \).  
   The volume of the cell is calculated using the formula for the volume of a cylinder:  
   \[
   V = \pi r^2 h = \pi (0.5 \, \mu\text{m})^2 (2.0 \, \mu\text{m}) = \pi (0.25 \, \mu\text{m}^2) (2.0 \, \mu\text{m}) = 1.5708 \, \mu\text{m}^3
   \]  
   Converting to cubic meters:  
   \[
   V = 1.5708 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{m}^3
   \]

2. **Hydrogen Ion Concentration**:  
   The intracellular pH is \( 6.4 \), so the hydrogen ion concentration is:  
   \[
   [\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-6.4} \approx 3.98 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{mol/m}^3
   \]

3. **Moles of \( \text{H}^+ \) Ions**:  
   The total moles of \( \text{H}^+ \) ions in the cell are:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of } \text{H}^+ = [\text{H}^+] \times V = (3.98 \times 10^{-7}) \times (1.5708 \times 10^{-18}) \approx 6.25 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{mol}
   \]

4. **Number of \( \text{H}^+ \) Ions**:  
   Using Avogadro's number (\( 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{ions/mol} \)):  
   \[
   \text{Number of } \text{H}^+ \text{ ions} = (6.25 \times 10^{-25}) \times (6.022 \times 10^{23}) \approx 376.375 \, \text{ions}
   \]

5. **Consideration of 80% Water**:  
   The cell is 80% water, so the volume of water is \( 0.8 \times 1.5708 \, \mu\text{m}^3 = 1.25664 \, \mu\text{m}^3 \).  
   Recalculating the moles of \( \text{H}^+ \) ions using the water volume:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of } \text{H}^+ = (3.98 \times 10^{-7}) \times (1.25664 \times 10^{-18}) \approx 5.0014 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{mol}
   \]  
   Number of \( \text{H}^+ \) ions:  
   \[
   (5.0014 \times 10^{-25}) \times (6.022 \times 10^{23}) \approx 30.11 \, \text{ions}
   \]  
   This result is inconsistent with the options provided, so the 80% water fraction was likely not intended to affect the calculation.

6. **Final Calculation**:  
   The total number of \( \text{H}^+ \) ions in the cell is approximately \( 376 \), but this value is not among the provided options. The closest option is **F: 350**, which is likely the intended answer due to rounding differences.

ANSWER: F
