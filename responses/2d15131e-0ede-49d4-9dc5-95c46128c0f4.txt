Okay, so I've got this question about gender differences in conversation styles, and I need to figure out the answer. The question is asking what women do more than men when it comes to conversation. The options are A through J, each describing a different behavior.

First, I remember reading somewhere that men and women have different communication styles, but I'm not exactly sure about the details. I think it's often discussed in terms of assertiveness versus supportiveness or something like that. Maybe women tend to be more supportive in conversations?

Looking at the options:

A: use more technical language. Hmm, I don't think so. Technical language might be more common in certain fields, but I'm not sure it's gendered like that.

B: ask more questions. That sounds plausible. I've heard that women might ask more questions to seek understanding or clarify things, which fits with a supportive communication style.

C: talk for longer periods of time. I'm not sure. I think men might speak more often or for longer in some contexts, but maybe women are more likely to take breaks or pause.

D: speak in a higher pitch. I know that pitch can vary, but I'm not sure if this is a consistent gender difference. Maybe it's more about perceived pitch than actual.

E: speak less frequently. This could be linked to women being more likely to wait for others to speak, which might mean they interrupt less but speak less often.

F: make more eye contact. I've heard that women tend to use more eye contact, but I'm not certain. It might depend on the culture too.

G: interrupt more often. I think this is more associated with men. Women might be less likely to interrupt, perhaps because they're waiting for others to finish.

H: use more body language. I'm not sure about this one. Both genders use body language, but maybe women use more gestures or open postures.

I: make less eye contact. If F is about making more, then I is the opposite. I'm not sure, but I think women might make more eye contact.

J: use more fillers like "um" or "like". I've heard that women might use more fillers, perhaps to pause without being as assertive.

Now, trying to recall research: I think that women are more likely to use verbal fillers, like "um" or "you know," and they might also ask more questions to facilitate conversation rather than dominate it. Also, women might use more body language, such as gestures, to express themselves.

Wait, but the question is about what women do compared to men. So, for option B, asking more questions, that makes sense because women might engage more in seeking others' opinions, which is part of a supportive style. Similarly, using more fillers (J) could be a sign of being less assertive and more tentative in communication.

I'm a bit torn between B and J. Another point is that women might speak less frequently (E) because they might wait for others to speak, especially in mixed-gender conversations. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, I remember reading that women are more likely to use hedges and fillers, so J might be correct. But I'm not certain. Also, eye contact: I think women make more eye contact, so F might be correct, but I'm not sure if that's a well-established finding.

Wait, the most common stereotype is that women use more fillers and are more tentative in their speech. So J could be the answer. But I'm not 100% sure.

Another angle: in terms of interruptions, G says men interrupt more. So women would interrupt less, but the question is what women do more. So the options are about what women do more than men.

Let me think again: the options are about women compared to men.

A: technical language – probably not.

B: ask more questions – possibly.

C: talk longer – maybe not.

D: higher pitch – maybe, but unsure.

E: speak less – perhaps.

F: more eye contact – maybe.

G: interrupt more – men do this more, so women less.

H: use more body language – maybe.

I: less eye contact – opposite of F.

J: more fillers – possibly.

From what I recall, women are more likely to use fillers like "um," "uh," "like," etc. So J might be correct.

Alternatively, I think that women are more likely to use questions to engage in conversation, so B could also be correct.

Wait, another angle: in conversations, women might use more questions to build rapport, whereas men might be more direct. So B: ask more questions.

I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to think of examples. If I've heard that women use more fillers, like in casual conversations, they might say "you know" or "like" more often. That would make J correct.

But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe I should look for the most commonly accepted answer. From what I remember, the idea that women use more fillers is a common stereotype, but I'm not certain if it's a proven fact. Alternatively, the tendency to ask more questions aligns with a more collaborative conversational style, which is often attributed to women.

I think the answer is B: ask more questions. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, J might be correct if the focus is on verbal fillers.

Wait, another point: in some studies, women are found to use more verbal fillers, so J could be the answer. But in other contexts, like in professional settings, men might use more technical language, but that's not the same as everyday conversation.

Hmm, I'm still not sure. Maybe I should think about the answer as B: ask more questions, because that's a more active role in the conversation, facilitating dialogue rather than just using fillers.

The question asks about gender differences in conversation styles, specifically what women do more than men. After considering the options, the most plausible answer is that women ask more questions. This aligns with the idea that women often engage in a more supportive and collaborative conversational style, which involves seeking understanding and encouraging dialogue. While other options like using more fillers (J) or making more eye contact (F) were considered, the act of asking questions (B) stands out as a key difference in communication patterns.

Answer: B
