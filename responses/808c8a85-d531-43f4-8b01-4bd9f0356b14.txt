Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about intermolecular forces. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking which option correctly lists the forces from strongest to weakest. The options are A to E, each with a different order of dipole-dipole, induced dipole, and hydrogen bonds.

Hmm, I remember that intermolecular forces are the forces that hold molecules together. The stronger the force, the higher the boiling point, right? So the order of strength probably affects physical properties like melting and boiling points.

Wait, I think the main types are hydrogen bonds, dipole-dipole, and induced dipole (London dispersion) forces. From strongest to weakest, which comes first? I'm pretty sure hydrogen bonds are the strongest. Yeah, because they form when a hydrogen atom is bonded to a highly electronegative atom like O, N, or F, and it creates a strong attraction between molecules.

Then, after hydrogen bonds, comes dipole-dipole interactions. These happen between polar molecules where there's a partial positive and partial negative charge. So the positive end of one molecule is attracted to the negative of another. These are weaker than hydrogen bonds but stronger than induced dipoles.

Induced dipole, also known as London dispersion forces, are the weakest. They occur when a temporary dipole in one atom induces a dipole in another. These are temporary and only significant in molecules with lots of electrons, like larger atoms or molecules. So they're definitely the weakest of the three.

So putting it together, the order from strongest to weakest should be: hydrogen bond > dipole-dipole > induced dipole.

Now looking at the options:

Option E: Induced dipole < dipole-dipole < hydrogen bond. Wait, that's the same as what I just thought. So E would be the correct order. Let me double-check the options.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option E: Induced dipole < dipole-dipole < hydrogen bond. So yes, that's the correct order. Let me check the other options to make sure I didn't miss anything.

Option A: Dipole < induced < H-bond. No, that's wrong because dipole is stronger than induced.

Option B: Induced < H-bond < dipole. No, dipole is weaker than H-bond, so this can't be right.

Option C: Dipole < H-bond < induced. No, induced is the weakest.

Option D: H-bond < dipole < induced. No, that's opposite.

Option F: H-bond < induced < dipole. No, dipole is stronger than induced, but H-bond is stronger than dipole.

So the correct order is E: Induced dipole < dipole-dipole < hydrogen bond.

The question asks for the correct order of intermolecular forces from strongest to weakest. The key intermolecular forces are hydrogen bonds, dipole-dipole interactions, and induced dipoles (London dispersion forces). 

Hydrogen bonds are the strongest because they involve a highly electronegative atom bonded to hydrogen, creating a strong attraction between molecules. Dipole-dipole interactions are weaker than hydrogen bonds but stronger than induced dipoles, as they involve partial charges between polar molecules. Induced dipoles are the weakest, arising from temporary dipoles in molecules.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option E**: Induced dipole < dipole-dipole < hydrogen bond. This matches the correct order.
- Other options either reverse the order or place forces incorrectly.

Thus, the correct answer is:

E
