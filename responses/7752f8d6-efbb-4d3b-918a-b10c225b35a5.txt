Question:

Congress has recently enacted a statute designed to prevent price gouging of gasoline by private retail sellers. To help administer the new statute Congress created a seven-member agency, four members of which were appointed by the President, two by the Senate, and one by the Speaker of the House. The agency was authorized to issue rules interpreting regulations prescribed under existing federal law. It was also authorized to issue "cease and desist" orders after hearings against private retail sellers of gasoline who "intentionally engaged in price gouging. " In this regard, violations of the cease and desist orders were made punishable by fine and/or imprisonment. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument against the authority of this agency?

Options:

A: Congress may not delegate to the agency power to interpret regulations without the approval of the President.
B: Congress may not delegate to the agency power to issue fines.
C: Congress may not delegate to the agency power to imprison private citizens.
D: Congress may not delegate enforcement of a federal law in any governmental body other than the U. S. Attorney General or the courts.
E: Congress may not delegate to the agency power to make "cease and desist" orders, the violation of which is punishable by imprisonment.
F: Congress may not delegate to the agency power to make interpretations of existing federal laws.
G: Congress may not create an agency to regulate private business practices.
H: Congress may not delegate to the agency power to regulate prices.
I: Congress may not retain the power to appoint even a minority of members of such an agency.
J: Congress may not delegate power to an agency without the approval of the Supreme Court.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about constitutional law, specifically about Congress delegating authority to an agency. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about an agency created by Congress to prevent gasoline price gouging. The agency has seven members: four appointed by the President, two by the Senate, and one by the Speaker of the House. Their powers include issuing rules to interpret regulations under existing federal law, and they can issue "cease and desist" orders against private sellers who intentionally engage in price gouging. Violations of these orders can lead to fines and/or imprisonment.

The question is asking which constitutional argument is the strongest against this agency's authority. The options are A through J.

I remember that the Constitution has certain limits on what Congress can delegate to administrative agencies. The main principle is the non-delegation doctrine, which stems from the idea of separation of powers. Congress can't just give away its legislative power to another branch or an agency. There's a case, maybe the Chevron case, where the Supreme Court discussed how much Congress can delegate.

Looking at the options:

Option A says Congress can't delegate power to interpret regulations without the President's approval. I'm not sure about this. I think agencies often interpret regulations on their own, and the President doesn't need to approve each interpretation. So maybe A isn't the strongest argument.

Option B says Congress can't delegate the power to issue fines. Well, agencies do issue fines all the time. The EPA, for example, can fine companies for environmental violations. So B doesn't seem correct.

Option C claims Congress can't delegate the power to imprison. That's a big deal because imprisonment is a form of punishment, which is typically a legislative function. But wait, agencies can impose penalties, including fines, but does that include imprisonment? I think only courts can impose imprisonment because it's a criminal sanction. So if the agency can order imprisonment, that might be problematic. But I'm not entirely sure if this is the main issue here.

Option D states Congress can't delegate enforcement to any body other than the Attorney General or courts. I think enforcement can be delegated to agencies; for example, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) enforces securities laws. So D might not be correct.

Option E says Congress can't delegate the power to make "cease and desist" orders that are punishable by imprisonment. This is interesting because "cease and desist" orders are administrative orders. If violating them leads to imprisonment, that might be a problem because it's like creating a new criminal law through an agency. So E could be a strong argument.

Option F argues against delegating the power to interpret existing laws. Agencies do interpret laws all the time through regulations and rulemaking. The courts usually defer to them under Chevron. So F might not be the right answer.

Option G suggests Congress can't create an agency to regulate private business. That doesn't sound right because Congress does create agencies to regulate various industries, like the FDA or FTC.

Option H says Congress can't delegate to regulate prices. The Supreme Court has had cases about price controls, like the ones involving the ICC ( Interstate Commerce Commission). But here, the agency isn't setting prices; they're preventing gouging through cease and desist orders, which is different.

Option I claims Congress can't retain minority appointments. I don't think the Constitution prohibits Congress from appointing some members of an agency. The President appoints many, but Congress can have some too, as in this case with two from the Senate and one from the Speaker. So I don't think I is the issue.

Option J says Congress can't delegate without Supreme Court approval. That doesn't make sense; agencies are created by Congress, not needing judicial approval.

So focusing on the main issue: the agency is issuing orders that, when violated, can lead to imprisonment. The key here is whether Congress can delegate the authority to impose criminal penalties, especially imprisonment, to an administrative agency.

I recall that in the case of United States v. Grimaud, the Supreme Court held that agencies can enforce the law, including imposing penalties, but there's a line when it comes to criminal sanctions. The case of McCulloch v. Maryland comes to mind, but that's more about state taxation of the federal government.

Wait, another case: the Supreme Court in cases like the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) cases allows agencies to enforce their orders, but when it comes to criminal penalties, the delegation must be clear. But in this case, the agency's orders can lead to imprisonment, which is a serious sanction that might require more precise delegation.

But the strongest argument would probably be that Congress cannot delegate the power to impose criminal penalties, such as imprisonment, to an agency. Because that's a core attribute of legislative power. So the argument would be that by making violations of the agency's orders punishable by imprisonment, Congress has improperly delegated its lawmaking authority.

Looking back at the options, option E is about making "cease and desist" orders that are punishable by imprisonment. Option C is about the power to imprison directly. But the agency isn't directly imprisoning; they're issuing orders, and the violation leads to imprisonment by the courts, perhaps. Wait, noâ€” the wording says "violation... is punishable by fine and/or imprisonment." So the agency is effectively creating a new criminal offense, which is a problem because that's a legislative function.

Wait, but the agency isn't creating the law; Congress created the statute, and the agency is enforcing it. So perhaps that's different. Or is it?

Alternatively, the issue might be that the agency is being given quasi-judicial powers, like issuing orders that have criminal penalties attached. The Supreme Court in cases like the Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan (1938) struck down a delegation where Congress gave the President too broad a power to set production quotas without sufficient standards, which impacted economic activities.

In this case, the agency is being given the authority to issue cease and desist orders that can lead to imprisonment. That seems like a significant delegation. The argument would be that this is too much delegation because it allows the agency to determine what constitutes a violation and impose criminal sanctions, which is a legislative function.

So, the strongest argument would be that Congress cannot delegate to the agency the power to make such orders where the violations are punishable by imprisonment. That would be option E.

Wait, but another angle: the delegation of the power to impose criminal penalties is unconstitutional because it violates the separation of powers. Congress can't delegate the power to create criminal laws. The agency's orders having criminal penalties attached might be seen as creating new laws, which is a legislative function.

Alternatively, option C says Congress may not delegate the power to imprison. But the agency isn't imprisoning; they're issuing orders, and the enforcement (arrest and imprisonment) would presumably be done by the courts or the Department of Justice. But the problem is that the agency's orders are being made enforceable by criminal penalties, which might be seen as Congress allowing an agency to define criminal conduct without sufficient standards.

Wait, but the agency here isn't creating the law; Congress created the law against price gouging. The agency is enforcing it by issuing orders. So maybe the issue is more about the delegation of enforcement powers and whether the penalties are too severe.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the agency is being given rulemaking power over existing regulations, which is okay, but the problem is the enforcement aspect with imprisonment.

I'm a bit confused, but I think the main issue is that Congress can't delegate the authority to impose criminal penalties, especially imprisonment, to an administrative agency. So the strongest argument would be that the delegation of the power to make cease and desist orders, which are then punishable by imprisonment, is unconstitutional.

So the answer should be E.
</think>

The strongest constitutional argument against the agency's authority is that Congress cannot delegate the power to issue "cease and desist" orders, the violation of which is punishable by imprisonment, as this constitutes an improper delegation of legislative power, which is a core function reserved for Congress under the separation of powers doctrine.
