Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A company offered to sell several loads of landscaping stones at a specified price and itemized terms. The offeree sent a notification to the offeror stating, "We have received your offer to sell landscaping stone per specified terms this date." The offeror shipped the goods upon receiving that notification. On the date of shipment, the offeree posted an acceptance form with slight modifications to the terms. After the goods arrived, the offeree called the offeror's manager and told him that the company was unable to accept the offer at this time, he was shipping the goods back, and to "ignore any paperwork we sent." The offeror sued the offeree for breach of contract. Who will prevail?

Options:

A: The offeree will prevail because verbal rejection of the contract is considered valid.
B: The offeror will prevail because the offeree's modifications to the terms were not significant enough to void the contract.
C: The offeror will prevail because it shipped the goods when it received the first acceptance.
D: The offeree will prevail because it returned the goods, effectively cancelling the contract.
E: The offeree will prevail because it rejected the offer when it called the offeror's manager.
F: The offeror will prevail because the offeree did not officially cancel the contract in writing.
G: The offeror will prevail because the posting of the acceptance finalized a contract between the parties.
H: The offeree will prevail because the modifications to the terms were not accepted by the offeror.
I: The offeror will prevail because the offeree already accepted the terms when it sent the initial notification.
J: The offeree will prevail because it never accepted the offer on the same terms specified.

Okay, so I've got this contract law question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's break it down.

Alright, the situation is about a company offering to sell landscaping stones. The offeror is the seller, and the offeree is the buyer. The offeror made a specific offer with certain terms, and the offeree responded in a particular way. Then there's a series of events leading to a breach of contract claim. I need to determine who will win the lawsuit.

First, let me outline the key events:

1. The offeror (seller) sends an offer to sell stones at a specified price with itemized terms.
2. The offeree (buyer) sends a notification saying they received the offer. The notification doesn't explicitly accept but just acknowledges receipt.
3. Upon receiving this notification, the offeror ships the goods.
4. On the shipment date, the offeree posts an acceptance form but with slight modifications to the terms.
5. After the goods arrive, the offeree calls the offeror's manager, says they can't accept the offer, are shipping the goods back, and to ignore any paperwork they sent.

The offeror sues for breach. Who wins?

Hmm. Let's think about contract formation. For a contract to be formed, there needs to be an offer, acceptance, and consideration. Also, acceptance must mirror the offer unless the offer allows for modifications.

In this case, the offeree's first response was just acknowledging receipt, not an acceptance. So that's not acceptance yet. Then they posted an acceptance with modifications. Now, in contract law, if the offeree modifies the terms, that's usually a rejection and a counter-offer, unless the offer invites modifications. 

But wait, the offeree didn't explicitly accept the original terms. They modified them. If the offer was firm and didn't allow modifications, then this would be a counter-offer, not an acceptance. So the offeror would have to accept those modified terms for a contract to form.

But then, the offeree later called and said they couldn't accept, were returning the goods, and to ignore the paperwork. So what's the timeline here?

The offeror shipped the goods upon receiving the first notification, which was just an acknowledgment, not an acceptance. So shipping might be seen as an act in anticipation of the contract, but not necessarily acceptance yet.

Then, the offeree posted an acceptance with modifications. If the offer wasn't allowing for modifications, this would be a rejection. But the offeror might argue that the modifications were minor and not material, so the contract was formed. However, the offeree then verbally rejected the offer, saying they couldn't accept and were returning the goods.

Verbal rejection after a contract has been formed can sometimes affect the situation. But in contract law, once a contract is formed, both parties are bound unless there's a valid reason to rescind, like mutual mistake, fraud, etc. But here, the offeree is trying to back out because they didn't like the terms, but they sent a modified acceptance first.

Wait, but before the contract was formed, the offeree sent a modified acceptance, which would be a counter-offer. The offeror didn't accept that, right? Because they were already shipping. But then the offeree sent the goods back and verbally rejected.

Alternatively, if the modifications were insignificant, maybe the offeror considered it an acceptance. But if the offer didn't allow for modifications, then the modified terms would not form a contract. So the offeree's actions would be a counter-offer, and since there's no acceptance from the offeror, no contract was formed.

But wait, the offeror shipped the goods upon receipt of the acknowledgment. So maybe the offeror treated the acknowledgment as an acceptance? But in contract law, acknowledgment isn't acceptance. So the offeror might have shipped under a mistake, thinking there was a contract, but in reality, there wasn't until there was an acceptance.

Then, the offeree tried to accept with modified terms, which might not have been accepted by the offeror. If the offeror didn't accept the modifications, then no contract. So when the offeree called and said they were rejecting and sending back the goods, that might be an effective rejection.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

- Offer is made by offeror.
- Offeree acknowledges receipt but doesn't accept.
- Offeror ships goods, thinking maybe the offeree accepted?
- Offeree then sends an acceptance with modifications. If the offer allowed for that, then it's a new offer. If not, it's a rejection.
- Then offeree calls and says they can't accept, return goods, ignore paperwork.

So, if the modified terms were sent, and the offeror didn't accept them, then no contract. So the offeree's actions after that would be trying to reject an offer they made, which might not be possible because once you make an offer (the modified terms), the other party can accept or not. But since the offeror didn't accept, the offeree can't unilaterally cancel.

Alternatively, the offeror's act of shipping might be considered acceptance, making the offeree's acknowledgment sufficient. Wait, no, because the acknowledgment isn't acceptance. So the offeror's shipping could be an implied acceptance, but that depends on the context. In business contexts, sometimes actions can constitute acceptance, but usually, if the offer specifies that acceptance must be in writing, then oral or action might not suffice.

But here, the offer was itemized with specific terms, so perhaps the offer required acceptance in writing. So the offeree's initial acknowledgment wasn't acceptance. Then, when they sent the modified acceptance, if the offer didn't allow modifications, that's a counter-offer. So unless the offeror accepted those modified terms, no contract.

But then the offeree called and said they couldn't accept, which might be a rejection of their own counter-offer. So no contract was formed. Therefore, the offeror's shipping was premature, and the offeree isn't bound. So the offeree can return the goods, and the offeror can't sue for breach because no contract existed.

Wait, but the options don't all align with that. Let me look at the options.

Option E says the offeree will prevail because they rejected the offer when they called. That aligns with the idea that no contract was formed because the offeree's modifications made it a counter-offer, and their subsequent rejection was valid.

Option H says the offeree will prevail because the modifications weren't accepted. That also makes sense because without the offeror's acceptance of the modified terms, no contract.

Option J says the offeree never accepted on the same terms, which is correct because they modified the terms, so no acceptance under the original offer.

Option E and J seem similar. But the offeree's verbal rejection after the factâ€”does that count?

Wait, if the offeree's modification was a counter-offer, and the offeror didn't accept, then there's no contract. So the offeree's later rejection doesn't matter because the contract wasn't formed. So the offeree didn't accept the original offer, so no contract, and thus the offeror can't sue for breach.

So the offeree would prevail because there was no valid acceptance, and their subsequent actions were just rejecting their own counter-offer.

Looking at the options, E says the offeree rejected when they called, but in reality, the rejection was of their own counter-offer, not the original. So perhaps H or J is better.

Option J: offeree never accepted on same terms. So they didn't accept the original offer, so no contract. Therefore, the offeree prevails.

Alternatively, H says the modifications weren't accepted, so the contract wasn't formed. That could also be correct.

Wait, but the offeree's modified terms were sent as acceptance. If the offer didn't allow modifications, that's a counter-offer, which the offeror didn't accept. So the offeror's shipping after the acknowledgment might be seen as an implied acceptance, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the offeror's shipping upon acknowledgment was an acceptance, making a contract. Then the offeree's modification would be a breach because they tried to change terms after acceptance.

But I think in contract law, once the offeree accepts, they can't modify unless the offer allows it. So if the offeree tried to modify after acceptance, that's a breach.

Wait, but in this case, the offeree didn't accept first. They first acknowledged, then sent a modified acceptance. So the sequence is:

1. Offeror offers.
2. Offeree acknowledges (not acceptance).
3. Offeror ships (thinking acceptance? Maybe the offer allowed for this as acceptance by performance? Or maybe it's an implied acceptance).
4. Offeree then sends modified acceptance. If the offer required exact terms, this is a counter-offer. So the contract isn't formed until offeror accepts. But the offeror didn't do that.

Then, offeree calls and says they are rejecting. So if no contract was formed, the offeree can return the goods and isn't liable.

Alternatively, if the offeror's shipping was acceptance, then the offeree's modification would be a breach.

I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think about the rules.

An acceptance must be unequivocal and mirror the offer. If the offeree's response was a modification, that's a rejection and a counter-offer. So unless the offer allows for modifications, the contract isn't formed until the offeror accepts the counter-offer.

In this case, the offeree modified the terms, so unless the offer allowed for that, the contract wasn't formed. Therefore, the offeree can reject the original offer without liability.

But then, the offeror shipped the goods upon receiving the acknowledgment. If the acknowledgment was treated as acceptance, then the contract was formed, and the offeree's modification would be a breach.

But in reality, an acknowledgment isn't acceptance. So the offeror's shipping might have been a unilateral act, perhaps as part of their terms for acceptance (like shipping as acceptance). But that depends on the specific terms of the offer. The question says the offer had "itemized terms," but it doesn't specify that shipping constitutes acceptance.

If the offer didn't state that shipping constitutes acceptance, then the offeror's shipping upon acknowledgment wouldn't form a contract. So the contract wasn't formed until the offeree accepted, which they did with modifications, which was a counter-offer. Since the offeror didn't accept, no contract.

Therefore, the offeree's actions after that, like calling to reject and returning the goods, would be valid because no contract existed. So the offeree prevails.

Looking at the options, option J says the offeree never accepted on the same terms, which is correct. Option E says the offeree rejected when they called, but that's after the modification, which was a counter-offer.

So the correct answer would be option J.
</think>

The offeree will prevail because they never accepted the offer on the same terms specified, as they modified the terms, which constitutes a counter-offer. Since the offeror did not accept the modified terms, no contract was formed. Therefore, the offeree's subsequent actions to reject and return the goods are valid.
