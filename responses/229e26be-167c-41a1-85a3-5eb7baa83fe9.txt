Question:

The State of Florida is prosecuting a former police officer for extortion of money from prostitutes. One of the State's witnesses is Sally. Sally has an adult conviction for vehicular homicide. She was charged with driving a car in a reckless manner resulting in the death of her sister, a passenger in the car. Sally pleaded nolo contendere, was adjudicated guilty and received a suspended sentence although she could have received a sentence of state imprisonment up to 5 years. At trial, evidence of this conviction is

Options:

A: inadmissible to impeach Sally because the conviction is not related to the case.
B: inadmissible to impeach Sally because her conviction is more than a year old.
C: inadmissible to impeach Sally because she is only a witness and not the criminal defendant.
D: admissible to impeach Sally because she was adjudicated guilty.
E: inadmissible to impeach Sally because she never admitted her guilt since she entered a plea of nolo contendere.
F: admissible to impeach Sally because vehicular homicide carries a maximum penalty in excess of 1 year.
G: admissible to impeach Sally because she was involved in an illegal activity.
H: inadmissible to impeach Sally because vehicular homicide is not a crime of moral turpitude.
I: inadmissible to impeach Sally because she received a suspended sentence.
J: admissible to impeach Sally because she could have received a sentence of state imprisonment up to 5 years.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence law question. Let me read through it again carefully.

The question is about whether a witness's prior conviction can be used to impeach her at trial. The witness is Sally, who has a conviction for vehicular homicide. She pleaded nolo contendere, which I remember means she didn't contest the charge but didn't admit guilt either. She was given a suspended sentence, though she could have gotten up to 5 years in state prison.

The options are A to J, each suggesting different reasons why the evidence might be admissible or not. I need to determine which one is correct.

First, I recall that under the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 609, a witness's prior conviction can be used to impeach their credibility. However, there are exceptions and specific conditions.

Rule 609(a)(1) says that a witness may be impeached with a conviction if the crime was one that would have carried a potential sentence of more than one year. Importantly, it doesn't matter if the sentence actually imposed was less. So, if the maximum penalty is over a year, it's admissible.

In this case, Sally's conviction is for vehicular homicide. I think vehicular homicide is a felony, which usually carries a sentence of more than a year. The question says she could have received up to 5 years, which definitely exceeds one year. Therefore, under Rule 609, her conviction is admissible for impeachment.

Wait, but some states have different rules. Oh, the question mentions it's in Florida, but federal rules are often followed unless specified otherwise. Plus, the question seems to be based on general principles, so I'll proceed with the federal rule.

Looking at the options:

A: Says it's inadmissible because unrelated. But the crime's nature isn't the issue here; it's about the sentence. So A is wrong.

B: Inadmissible because more than a year old. Wait, no, the age doesn't matter under 609. It's about the sentence, not the time since the conviction. So B is wrong.

C: Inadmissible because she's a witness, not the defendant. That's not true; 609 applies to any witness, so C is incorrect.

D: Admissible because she was adjudicated guilty. Wait, but 609 requires that the conviction be a crime that's punishable by more than a year. Adjudication alone may not be enough if the sentence didn't exceed a year, but here the max was 5 years, so D is correct in that it's admissible because of the conviction's implications, but perhaps F is a better fit because it directly points out the maximum penalty.

E: Inadmissible because she didn't admit guilt with nolo. But 609 doesn't require an admission; a conviction suffices regardless of the plea. So E is wrong.

F: Admissible because the maximum penalty exceeds a year. Yes, this aligns with Rule 609(a)(1). So F seems correct.

G: Admissible because she was involved in illegal activity. That's a lower standard, but the key is the sentence length, so G is not the best answer.

H: Inadmissible because not a crime of moral turpitude. Wait, 609 doesn't require the crime to be one of moral turpitude. It's about the sentence length. So H is incorrect.

I: Inadmissible because she got a suspended sentence. That doesn't matter; it's the potential sentence that counts, not the actual sentence. So I is wrong.

J: Admissible because she could have gotten 5 years. This is similar to F, but F is more precise in stating the maximum penalty. J is correct too, but F directly refers to the maximum, which is the key point.

Wait, both F and J seem correct. Let me check the exact wording of Rule 609(a)(1). It says, "a crime...for which a sentence of more than one year could have been imposed." So F says "vehicular homicide carries a maximum penalty in excess of 1 year." J says she "could have received a sentence up to 5 years." Both are correct, but F refers to the nature of the crime, while J refers to the potential sentence. Which option is better?

Looking at the options, F and J are both correct, but perhaps J is more specific to the facts given in the question. Wait, the question says she could have received up to 5 years, which is more than a year. So J directly uses that fact. However, F is also correct because it's about the maximum penalty.

Wait, but in the options, both F and J seem to state correct reasons, but the answer should be the one that best fits. Perhaps F is more about the nature of the crime, and J is about the potential sentence. But both are correct because both reasons apply. However, in the options, only one can be correct. Since the question is about admissibility, the key factor is whether the maximum penalty was over a year. So J is more directly tied to the fact that she could have gotten 5 years, which is over a year. So J might be the better answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Rule 609(a)(1) says the crime is one that could have resulted in a sentence of more than a year. So the fact that the maximum is 5 years satisfies this. Therefore, both F and J are correct. But F says "vehicular homicide carries a maximum penalty in excess of 1 year," which is a general statement, while J refers to Sally's specific situation. But in the context of the question, the fact that she could have received up to 5 years is what's important.

Wait, but F is a general statement about the crime, while J is specific to Sally's case. However, the admissibility depends on the crime's potential sentence, not the specific sentence she received. So even if the maximum is over a year, it's admissible. Therefore, F is the correct reason. Alternatively, J is correct because it's about her specific case.

Hmm, maybe I should look at the options again. The question is whether the evidence is admissible to impeach Sally. The reason is because the crime's maximum sentence is over a year. So F and J both touch on that. But F is about the crime's penalty, and J is about her potential sentence. So perhaps F is more accurate because it's about the crime itself, not just her case.

Wait, but the question is about her conviction, so perhaps J is better because it directly relates to her possible sentence, which is more than a year. Alternatively, under 609, it's the crime's potential sentence, regardless of the actual sentence given. So if the maximum is over a year, it's admissible. So F correctly states that the crime carries a max over a year, making it admissible. J says she could have gotten up to 5 years, which is more than a year, so that also makes it admissible.

Wait, but in the options, F and J are both correct. But in reality, only one can be correct. The options are from A to J, so I need to pick the best answer.

I think the correct answer is F because it directly refers to the maximum penalty of the crime, which is what Rule 609(a)(1) requires. Alternatively, J is correct because she could have received a sentence over a year, but F is a more general correct statement applicable to the crime.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F. Alternatively, J might be correct, but I'm a bit torn. However, upon reflection, the key is that the crime's maximum sentence is over a year, so F is correct. J is also correct, but perhaps F is the better answer because it's the reason based on the crime, not her specific sentence.

Wait no, the question is about her conviction, so the fact that the maximum is over a year (which F states) is the reason. So F is correct.

Wait, but the answer might be J because it specifically refers to her potential sentence. I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F because the maximum penalty of the crime (vehicular homicide) is over a year, making it admissible. So F is correct.

Wait, but looking back, the question says she could have received up to 5 years. So J says that, which is the same as F's reasoning. So both F and J are correct, but the way the options are phrased, J is more specific to the scenario. So perhaps J is the correct answer.

Wait, but in reality, under 609, it's the maximum sentence of the crime, not just her possible sentence. So F is correct because it's about the crime's maximum. J is also correct because she could have gotten over a year, but it's the same thing. So perhaps both F and J are correct, but looking at the options, only one can be correct.

Wait, the options are designed so that only one is correct. Let me think again. The answer should be F because it's about the maximum penalty of the crime, which is what 609(a)(1) requires. J is correct, but perhaps F is the better answer because it's more about the crime's nature. Alternatively, J is correct because it relates to her specific case.

I think I need to pick F because it's the reason based on the crime's maximum penalty, which is the key factor. So the answer is F.
</think>

The admissibility of Sally's prior conviction for impeachment depends on whether the crime carries a potential sentence of more than one year, as per Federal Rule of Evidence 609(a)(1). Vehicular homicide, with a maximum penalty of up to 5 years, satisfies this condition. Both options F and J touch on the admissibility, but F directly addresses the crime's maximum penalty, which is the key factor under 609. Therefore, the correct answer is:

F

**Answer: F**
