Question:

A 22-year-old woman comes to the office because of urticaria. This is her first episode of urticaria and it has occurred and then resolved several times in the past week. The history and physical examination disclose no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of action?

Options:

A: Refer her to an allergist
B: Initiate immunotherapy
C: Advise her to avoid all potential allergens
D: Determine the serum IgE concentration
E: Prescribe antibiotics immediately
F: Treat the symptoms
G: Schedule her for allergy testing
H: Determine the total eosinophil count
I: Recommend a skin biopsy
J: Suggest immediate hospitalization

Okay, so I've got this question about a patient with urticaria, and I need to figure out the best course of action. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the patient is a 22-year-old woman presenting with urticaria for the first time. Urticaria is hives, right? It's those itchy, raised welts on the skin. She says it's happened and resolved several times over the past week. That makes me think it's been recurring but not chronic yet, since chronic urticaria is usually more than six weeks.

The history and physical exam didn't show any abnormalities. So, no obvious signs of other issues like angioedema (which would be swelling, maybe in the face or throat), no other symptoms like difficulty breathing, and no underlying conditions that could be causing it, like thyroid issues or infections.

Looking at the options:

A: Refer to an allergist. Allergists do deal with hives, especially if it's related to allergies. But since this is a first episode and it's been resolving, maybe it's acute. I'm not sure if she needs an allergist right away.

B: Initiate immunotherapy. That's usually for long-term allergy management, like for hay fever or bee stings. I don't think that's the first step here.

C: Advise to avoid allergens. Makes sense, but without knowing the trigger, it's hard to tell what to avoid. Maybe, but not the most immediate action.

D: Determine serum IgE concentration. IgE is related to allergies. High levels might suggest an allergic cause. But again, maybe not the first step unless there's suspicion.

E: Prescribe antibiotics. Urticaria isn't an infection, so antibiotics wouldn't help. Unless it's secondary, but nothing in the question points to that.

F: Treat the symptoms. That sounds straightforward. Antihistamines are usually the go-to for symptom relief. If it's acute, this might be sufficient.

G: Schedule allergy testing. Similar to referring to an allergist, but maybe earlier. But if the cause isn't obvious, testing could help. But is it necessary right away?

H: Determine total eosinophil count. High eosinophils can indicate allergies or other conditions, but again, not the first step unless there's a reason to suspect it.

I: Recommend a skin biopsy. That seems extreme for urticaria. Biopsies are usually for more serious or persistent conditions.

J: Suggest hospitalization. Definitely not needed unless there's an emergency like anaphylaxis, which isn't mentioned here.

So, the patient has acute urticaria, first episode, resolving and recurring. No underlying issues. The most immediate and appropriate action is to treat the symptoms. Symptomatic treatment with antihistamines is standard. Referring to an allergist or testing might come later if it doesn't resolve or recurs frequently. So F seems the best choice.

The patient presents with acute urticaria, a first episode that has been resolving and recurring over the past week. Given the lack of abnormalities on examination, the most appropriate initial action is to treat the symptoms with antihistamines. Symptomatic relief is the standard approach for acute cases. 

Answer: F
