Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"Some men look at constitutions with sanctimonious reverence, and deem them like the ark of the covenant, too sacred to be touched. They ascribe to the men of the preceding age a wisdom more than human, and suppose what they did to be beyond amendmentâ€¦.But I know also, that laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths disclosed, and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also, and keep pace with the times."
Thomas Jefferson, 1816

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about political parties in the early United States, based on a quote from Thomas Jefferson. I need to figure out which option is correct.

First, let's read the quote again. Jefferson talks about how some people hold constitutions in high reverence, thinking they're sacred and beyond amendment. He argues that laws and institutions should evolve with the human mind as it progresses. So, he's saying that institutions, including maybe political parties, should change over time.

Now, the question is about the existence of political parties in the early U.S. The options are A to J, and I need to pick the most accurate one.

Let me think about what I know. I remember that the early U.S. had two main political parties: the Federalists and the Democratic-Republicans. The Federalists were led by figures like Alexander Hamilton and supported a strong central government. The Democratic-Republicans, led by Thomas Jefferson, favored states' rights and a more agrarian society.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Says two major parties dominated until Adams founded the Whig party in 1824. Hmm, I think the Whig party was formed later, perhaps in the 1830s. Also, the Federalists and Democratic-Republicans were the initial two.

Option B: They were formed during the Civil War? No, the Civil War was in the 1860s, way after the early U.S. period.

Option C: Banned under the Constitution? I don't recall that. The Constitution doesn't ban parties; in fact, early on, parties did form.

Option D: Only one party, the Federalist. That's not right because the Democratic-Republicans were the other main party.

Option E: Formed during the Revolutionary War. I think the parties formed after the war, during the establishment of the government under the Constitution.

Option F: Not formed until after Washington's presidency. Washington was president from 1789 to 1797. I believe the parties started forming during his time, like the 1790s.

Option G: Did not exist until the War of 1812. No, the parties were already established before that war, which was 1812-1815.

Option H: Washington warned against parties but accepted the Federalist endorsement. I think Washington did warn against the formation of parties in his Farewell Address, but he was a Federalist in practice, even if he didn't officially belong to the party.

Option I: Founding fathers embraced parties immediately. I'm not sure; some were against parties, but they did form eventually.

Option J: After the Constitution, debates on states' rights and economy led to parties like Federalists and Democratic-Republicans. This sounds right because after the Constitution was ratified, there were significant debates, which led to the formation of these parties.

So, considering all this, option J seems accurate. The quote from Jefferson aligns with the idea that institutions (like political parties) develop as society progresses, which fits with the formation of parties after the Constitution was in place due to differing opinions on governance and economic policies.

The correct answer is J. The formation of political parties like the Federalists and Democratic-Republicans occurred after the drafting of the Constitution, driven by debates over states' rights and economic interests. This aligns with Jefferson's view that institutions evolve with societal progress.

Answer: J
