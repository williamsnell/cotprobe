Question:

Mr. Louis is presently considering buying a new boat to give rides to tourists. He has two alternatives: Boat A costs $10,000 and consumes $2,000 in fuel per year. Boat B costs $7,000 and consumes $2,500. Both boats have a zero salvage value at the end of 10 years. If Ur. Louis considers a rate of return of 6% acceptable, (a) which boat should he purchase? (b) how much will he charge each tourist if there are 3 tourists to a ride and Mr. Louis plans to have 125 rides each year?

Options:

A: Boat B, $9.50 per passenger
B: Boat A, $8.96 per passenger
C: Boat A, $9.50 per passenger
D: Boat A, $12 per passenger
E: Boat A, $7.50 per passenger
F: Boat B, $7.50 per passenger

Okay, so Mr. Louis is thinking about buying a new boat to take tourists on rides. He's got two options, Boat A and Boat B. Let me try to figure out which one he should pick and how much he should charge per passenger.

First, the problem says he wants a rate of return of 6%. I remember that when evaluating investments or projects, the acceptable rate of return is like the minimum rate he expects to earn. So he'll probably use this to calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) or maybe compare the Present Worth of both boats.

Let me jot down the details:

Boat A:
- Cost: $10,000
- Annual fuel cost: $2,000
- Life: 10 years
- Salvage value: $0

Boat B:
- Cost: $7,000
- Annual fuel cost: $2,500
- Life: 10 years
- Salvage value: $0

He needs to choose between A and B based on their costs and returns.

I think the first step is to calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) for each boat. The one with a positive NPV would be a good investment. Since he's looking for a 6% rate, that's the discount rate.

NPV formula is:

NPV = -Initial Investment + (Annual Net Cash Inflows) * PVIFA(i, n)

Wait, but here, the initial investment is the cost of the boat, and the annual net cash inflow would be the revenue minus the operating costs. Hmm, but wait, the problem doesn't mention revenue directly. Instead, part (b) is about figuring out the price per passenger based on the number of tourists and rides.

Wait, maybe I should first figure out which boat is more economical in terms of cost. Since both have zero salvage value, it's a matter of which has lower total costs over 10 years, considering the time value of money.

Let me calculate the annual cost for each boat and then find the present value.

But wait, the annual fuel costs are recurring expenses. So the total cost for each boat over 10 years would be the initial cost plus the present value of the annual fuel costs.

So for each boat, total cost is Initial Cost + PV of annual fuel costs.

PV of an annuity is calculated using PVIFA(6%,10).

PVIFA(6%,10) is the present value interest factor for an annuity. I think the formula is [1 - (1 + i)^-n] / i.

Let me calculate that. i=0.06, n=10.

PVIFA = [1 - (1.06)^-10]/0.06 ≈ [1 - 0.5584]/0.06 ≈ 0.4416 / 0.06 ≈ 7.3601.

So PVIFA ≈ 7.3601.

Now, for Boat A:

Initial cost: $10,000

Annual fuel cost: $2,000

PV of fuel costs: 2000 * 7.3601 ≈ 14,720.20

Total present cost for A: 10,000 + 14,720.20 ≈ $24,720.20

For Boat B:

Initial cost: $7,000

Annual fuel cost: $2,500

PV of fuel costs: 2500 * 7.3601 ≈ 18,400.25

Total present cost for B: 7,000 + 18,400.25 ≈ $25,400.25

Comparing the two, Boat A has a lower present cost ($24,720) than Boat B ($25,400). So Boat A is more cost-effective. So for part (a), he should choose Boat A.

Wait, but maybe I should also consider the revenue aspect because the second part of the question is about pricing. So perhaps I need to calculate how much he needs to charge per passenger to make a certain return.

Part (b): How much will he charge each tourist if there are 3 tourists per ride and 125 rides per year.

So total number of passengers per year is 125 rides * 3 = 375 passengers.

He needs to determine the price per passenger such that he gets an acceptable return. I think this ties back to the NPV calculation. He needs to ensure that the revenue generated covers the costs and provides the required return.

Wait, perhaps the revenue should cover the total present worth of the costs, and then he can find the required revenue per passenger.

Alternatively, maybe the question is simpler, just calculating the break-even price without considering the time value of money. But since the first part used NPV, perhaps the second part should as well.

Alternatively, maybe the question is to calculate the required revenue per ride, then per passenger.

Let me think. The total cost per year for each boat is the fuel cost plus the annualized cost of the initial investment.

But maybe it's easier to calculate the annual net cash flow required to achieve a 6% return on the initial investment.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to calculate the required annual revenue minus costs to achieve the desired rate of return, then find the price per passenger.

Let me outline the steps:

1. For each boat, calculate the total present worth of costs.

We already did that: Boat A is $24,720, Boat B $25,400.

2. Then, calculate the required annual net cash flow to achieve a 6% return on the initial investment. Wait, but the initial investment is part of the present cost.

Alternatively, think of the total revenue needed to cover both the initial cost and the annual fuel costs, considering the time value of money.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the equivalent annual cost (EAC) for each boat and then determine the price per passenger based on that.

EAC is the annual cost when the present value of all costs is converted into an equivalent annual amount.

EAC = (Initial Cost + PV of annual costs) * (i) / (1 - (1 + i)^-n )

Alternatively, EAC = (Initial Cost * i) / (1 - (1 + i)^-n ) + Annual Cost

Wait, let me compute EAC for each boat.

For Boat A:

Initial cost: $10,000

Annual fuel: $2,000

PVIFA(6%,10)=7.3601

So PV of fuel costs: 2000 *7.3601=14,720.20

Total PV cost: 10,000 +14,720.20=24,720.20

EAC = (24,720.20 * 0.06) / (1 - 1.06^-10 )

Wait, wait, no. EAC can also be calculated as:

EAC = (Initial Cost * i) / (1 - (1 + i)^-n) + Annual Cost

So for Boat A:

EAC = (10,000 * 0.06)/(1 - 1.06^-10) + 2,000

We know that 1/(1 - 1.06^-10) is 1/(1 - 0.5584)=1/0.4416≈2.264

So:

EAC = (600 * 2.264) + 2,000 ≈ 1,358.4 + 2,000 ≈ $3,358.4 per year.

Similarly for Boat B:

Initial cost:7,000

Annual fuel:2,500

EAC = (7,000 * 0.06)/(1 -1.06^-10) +2,500

7,000 *0.06=420

420 *2.264≈947.28

So EAC=947.28 +2500≈$3,447.28 per year.

So Boat A has lower EAC ($3,358 vs $3,447), so it's more economical.

So for part (a), he should buy Boat A.

Now part (b): How much to charge each tourist.

He has 125 rides per year, each carrying 3 tourists. So total passengers per year: 125 *3=375.

He needs to cover the equivalent annual cost of $3,358.4 (from EAC of Boat A).

Wait, but wait: The EAC is the total annual cost. So to find the revenue needed, he needs to set the price such that total revenue equals EAC plus the desired profit. But the problem states he considers a 6% return acceptable. So perhaps the revenue should cover the EAC and provide a 6% return on the investment.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to calculate the required revenue per year to achieve a 6% return on the initial investment and cover the costs.

Alternatively, perhaps the required revenue is the EAC plus the desired return. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps the way to think about it is that the total revenue from passengers each year needs to be enough to cover the EAC and provide a 6% return on the initial investment.

Wait, but EAC already includes the present value of costs. Maybe the total revenue should be the EAC plus the desired return.

Alternatively, perhaps the required revenue is the sum of the EAC and the desired profit, which is based on the initial investment.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to calculate the total revenue needed each year to cover all costs and provide a 6% return.

Let me try this. The total present worth of the costs is $24,720.20 for Boat A.

To get a 6% return on this investment, the total revenue over 10 years should have a present worth equal to the cost plus 6% of the cost.

So desired present worth of revenue = 24,720.20 * 1.06 ≈ 26,191.41.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the revenue each year should generate a cash flow that, when discounted back, equals the initial cost plus 6%.

Wait, perhaps the total revenue each year should be such that the present value of all revenues equals the present cost plus 6% of that.

So PV of revenues = PV costs * 1.06.

PV costs for Boat A is $24,720.20.

So PV of revenues needed: 24,720.20 * 1.06 ≈ 26,191.41.

The annual revenue is R per year for 10 years. So:

PV of R * PVIFA(6%,10) = 26,191.41

So R = 26,191.41 / 7.3601 ≈ 3,556.14 per year.

So total revenue needed is about $3,556.14 per year.

He has 375 passengers per year. So price per passenger = 3,556.14 / 375 ≈ 9.482, which is approximately $9.48.

Looking at the options, option C is Boat A, $9.50 per passenger. Option B is Boat A, $8.96.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck.

Alternatively, perhaps the revenue should only cover the EAC plus the desired return on the initial investment.

Wait, the EAC is $3,358.4 per year. To get a 6% return on the initial investment of $10,000, he needs $600 per year (10,000 *0.06). So total required annual revenue would be EAC + 600 = 3,358.4 + 600 = 3,958.4.

Then, per passenger price: 3,958.4 /375 ≈10.55. Hmm, but that's not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Maybe the price is calculated based on covering the annual costs and providing a 6% return, without considering the time value beyond the initial cost.

Let me try another approach. The total cost for Boat A is initial cost plus annual fuel. The annual fuel is $2,000, and the initial cost is $10,000. So total cost over 10 years is $10,000 + (2,000 *10) = $30,000. But considering the time value, the present value is lower, but maybe for simplicity, we can ignore that and proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering the time value for part (b), just taking the total costs and desired return in simple terms.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to calculate the total cost per year, then add the desired profit, and then find the price per passenger.

Let me try that.

Boat A:

Initial cost: $10,000

Annual fuel: $2,000

Total annual cost: $2,000.

He wants a 6% return on his investment. So desired profit per year is 10,000 * 0.06 = $600.

So total required revenue per year: 2,000 + 600 = $2,600.

He has 125 rides, each with 3 passengers, so 375 passengers per year.

Price per passenger = 2,600 /375 ≈ $6.93. Hmm, but that's not in the options. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the desired return is on the total investment, so 6% of (10,000 + (2,000*10)) = 6% of $30,000 = $1,800 per year. So total revenue needed: 2,000 (fuel) + 1,800 (return) = $3,800.

Price per passenger: 3,800 /375 ≈ $10.13. Not matching options.

Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let's go back.

The options for part (b) include $8.96, $9.50, $10, $12, etc.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to calculate the break-even price without considering the time value beyond the initial cost. So:

Total annual costs for Boat A: initial cost + annual fuel = 10,000 + 2,000 = $12,000.

He wants a 6% return on the initial investment: 10,000 *0.06 = $600.

So total revenue needed: 12,000 + 600 = $12,600.

Number of passengers per year: 125 rides *3=375.

Price per passenger: 12,600 /375 = $33.6. That's way too high and not in the options.

Wait, that can't be right. I must be making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the return is on the total investment, which includes both initial cost and annual costs. So total investment is 10,000 + (2,000 *10) = $30,000. 6% of that is $1,800 per year.

So total revenue needed: 30,000 (total cost) + 1,800 (return) = $31,800.

But over 10 years, that's complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the required annual revenue is the sum of the annual costs plus the desired annual return.

Wait, maybe the desired return is 6% per annum on the initial investment, so $600 per year.

So annual costs: $2,000.

So total revenue needed per year: 2,000 + 600 = $2,600.

Then, price per passenger: 2,600 /375 ≈ $6.93. Not matching options.

Hmm, none of these are matching. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think differently.

Perhaps the price per passenger is calculated based on the equivalent annual cost (EAC) that I calculated earlier, which for Boat A was approximately $3,358.4 per year.

So he needs to generate $3,358.4 in revenue per year.

Number of passengers per year:375.

Price per passenger: 3,358.4 /375 ≈ $8.94. That rounds to $8.96, which is option B or G.

Looking back, Boat A's EAC is lower, so the price would be lower. So the correct option would be Boat A with $8.96 per passenger, which is option B.

Wait, but earlier when I considered the PV of the costs, I had Boat A's PV as $24,720.20. To get a 6% return, the PV of revenue should be 24,720.20 *1.06 =26,191.41.

The annual revenue needed would be 26,191.41 /7.3601≈3,556.14.

Then, 3,556.14 /375≈9.48, which is close to $9.50, option C.

Hmm, but why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the price based on the EAC plus the desired return. So EAC is $3,358.4. Desired return is 6% on the initial investment, which is $600 per year.

So total required revenue is 3,358.4 +600=3,958.4.

Price per passenger:3,958.4/375≈10.55. Not matching options.

Alternatively, maybe the return is on the present worth of the costs. So present worth is $24,720.20. 6% of that is 1,483.21. So total PV of revenue needed is 24,720.20 +1,483.21=26,203.41.

Then annual revenue needed:26,203.41 /7.3601≈3,566.

Price per passenger:3,566 /375≈9.50, which is option C.

So perhaps the correct answer is C: Boat A, $9.50 per passenger.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated the EAC method, I got around $8.96. So which is correct?

I think the correct approach is to consider the present worth of costs and then add the desired return, and then find the annual revenue needed.

So:

PV of costs = $24,720.20.

Desired PV of return:24,720.20 *0.06=1,483.21.

Total PV of revenue needed=24,720.20 +1,483.21=26,203.41.

Annual revenue needed=26,203.41 /7.3601≈3,566.

Price per passenger=3,566 /375≈9.50.

So the answer would be C: Boat A, $9.50 per passenger.

But wait, looking at the options, option B is Boat A, $8.96. That's based on EAC method without adding the return.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the break-even price without considering the return, just covering the costs. Or maybe the return is included in the revenue.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simpler: the cost per passenger is the total annual cost (fuel) divided by the number of passengers, and the price is set to cover that plus a 6% return on the initial investment.

Wait, let me try that.

Boat A:

Annual fuel cost: $2,000.

Total passengers per year:375.

Cost per passenger:2000 /375≈5.333.

To get a 6% return on $10,000, he needs $600 per year.

So total annual revenue needed:2,000 +600=2,600.

Price per passenger:2,600 /375≈6.93. Not matching options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the options again.

Options for Boat A:

B: $8.96

C: $9.50

E: $7.50

J: $10

Boat B options: A, F, G, H, I.

From part (a), we determined Boat A is better. So options are B, C, E, J.

I think the correct answer is B: Boat A, $8.96 per passenger, based on the EAC method without the return. Or perhaps the correct approach is to use the present value of the costs and calculate the required price.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the price based on the total present cost plus desired return, then divide by the total number of passengers over 10 years.

Total present cost for Boat A: $24,720.20.

Desired return:24,720.20 *0.06=1,483.21.

Total present value needed:24,720.20 +1,483.21=26,203.41.

Total passengers over 10 years:375 *10=3,750.

Price per passenger:26,203.41 /3,750≈6.98. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the price is based on the annual required revenue, which is the EAC plus the desired annual return.

EAC for Boat A: $3,358.4.

Desired annual return: $600.

Total annual revenue needed:3,358.4 +600=3,958.4.

Price per passenger:3,958.4 /375≈10.55. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem doesn't require considering the time value for part (b), only for part (a). So in part (a), Boat A is better because it has lower present cost. In part (b), calculate the price per passenger without considering the time value.

So total annual costs for Boat A: $2,000 fuel + $10,000 initial cost. But wait, the initial cost is a one-time expense. So perhaps the annual operating cost is $2,000. To get a 6% return on the $10,000 investment, he needs $600 per year.

So total revenue needed per year:2,000 +600= $2,600.

Price per passenger:2,600 /375≈6.93. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the 6% return is on the total investment, which includes both initial and annual costs. So total investment over 10 years:10,000 +2,000*10=30,000. 6% of 30,000 is 1,800 per year.

Total revenue needed:30,000 (costs) +1,800 (return)=31,800 over 10 years.

Annual revenue:31,800 /10=3,180.

Price per passenger:3,180 /375≈8.48. Closest is $8.96, but not exact.

Wait, but 3,180 /375=8.48. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the price is calculated as (Total annual cost + desired return) / passengers.

Total annual cost:2,000.

Desired return:600.

Total:2,600.

2,600 /375≈6.93.

Not matching.

I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for the options again.

The options for Boat A are B ($8.96), C ($9.50), E ($7.50), J ($10).

If I go back to the EAC method where the EAC is $3,358.4 per year, and he wants a 6% return on his investment, which is $600 per year. So total revenue needed is 3,358.4 +600=3,958.4.

3,958.4 /375≈10.55. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the price is just based on covering the EAC, without the return. So 3,358.4 /375≈8.94, which is approximately $8.96. So option B: Boat A, $8.96.

That makes sense. So part (a) is Boat A, part (b) is $8.96.

So the answer is option B.
</think>

Mr. Louis is evaluating two boats, A and B, to determine which is more economical and how much to charge per passenger. The analysis involves calculating the present value of costs and determining the equivalent annual cost (EAC) for each boat. Boat A has a lower present value of costs ($24,720.20) compared to Boat B ($25,400.25), making it the better choice for part (a).

For part (b), the equivalent annual cost (EAC) for Boat A is calculated as $3,358.4. To achieve a 6% return on the initial investment, the total annual revenue needed is derived by dividing the EAC by the total number of passengers per year (375). This results in a price per passenger of approximately $8.96. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
