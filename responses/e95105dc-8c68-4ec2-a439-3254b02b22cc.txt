Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about a firm in a perfectly competitive industry. I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking which statement is true for such a firm. The options are A through J. Let me recall what I know about perfectly competitive markets.

In a perfectly competitive market, there are a lot of firms and each one is a price taker. That means they have to accept the market price as given; they can't set their own price. So the firm's average revenue is the same as the market price. Since each unit sold is at the same price, the marginal revenue—the revenue from selling one more unit—is equal to the average revenue. That makes sense because if each unit is sold for the same price, the additional revenue from one more unit is just that price.

Looking at the options:

A: Average revenue equals marginal revenue. That seems correct because in perfect competition, each unit's marginal revenue is the same as the average revenue (which is the price).

B: Marginal revenue is always increasing. Hmm, I don't think that's right. If the firm can sell as much as it wants at the market price, the MR shouldn't change; it should be constant. So if MR is the same for each unit, it's not increasing or decreasing—it's flat.

C: Average revenue is always negative. No, that doesn't make sense. If the market price is positive, which it usually is, average revenue is positive. Negative prices would be unusual unless the firm is giving things away, which isn't typical.

D: Marginal revenue equals total revenue. That can't be right. Marginal revenue is the change in total revenue from an extra unit, while total revenue is the sum of all revenues. They can't be equal unless maybe for one unit, but generally, MR is a rate, TR is a total.

E: Average revenue is initially negative and then becomes positive. No, in perfect competition, the average revenue is just the market price, which is fixed. It doesn't change based on quantity sold. So it's either positive or negative, but it doesn't start negative and become positive.

F: Marginal revenue is decreasing. No, as I thought earlier, MR is constant in perfect competition because each additional unit sold brings in the same revenue.

G: Total revenue always decreases. That would only happen if the firm is selling less, but in perfect competition, the firm can choose how much to produce. If they produce more, TR increases. So TR doesn't always decrease.

H: Total revenue increases and then decreases. That sounds like a scenario where selling more initially increases TR but after a certain point, maybe costs or something else causes TR to drop. But in perfect competition, as long as the price is positive, selling more units should keep increasing TR linearly.

I: Total revenue equals average revenue. That doesn't make sense because TR is quantity times average revenue. So unless quantity is 1, they won't be equal. For example, if you sell 2 units at $10 each, TR is $20, average revenue is $10, so they aren't equal.

J: Marginal revenue is initially positive and then becomes negative. No, because in perfect competition, MR is constant at the market price. If the market price is positive, MR stays positive. It doesn't turn negative unless the price becomes negative, which isn't typical.

So the correct answer should be A: Average revenue equals marginal revenue. Because in perfect competition, the firm's MR is equal to the price, which is the average revenue per unit.

The correct answer is A: Average revenue equals marginal revenue. In a perfectly competitive market, each firm is a price taker, meaning the market price is fixed. As a result, the average revenue (AR), which is the revenue per unit sold, is equal to the marginal revenue (MR), the additional revenue from selling one more unit. Since each unit sold contributes the same revenue, MR remains constant and equal to AR.

Answer: A
