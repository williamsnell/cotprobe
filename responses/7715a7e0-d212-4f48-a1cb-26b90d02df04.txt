Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about impedance matching using a quarter-wave transformer. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem states that there's a signal source at 50 MHz with an output impedance of 20 ohms. It's connected to a load impedance of 150 + j40 ohms through a coaxial line. The question is whether a quarter-wave transformer can match the source to the load.

First, I remember that a quarter-wave transformer is a type of impedance transformer. It's used to match two different impedances so that maximum power transfer occurs. The key here is understanding how the characteristic impedance of the transformer affects the matching.

The basic idea is that for a quarter-wave transformer to work, the characteristic impedance (Z0) of the transformer should be the geometric mean of the source impedance (Zs) and the load impedance (Zl). The formula is Z0 = sqrt(Zs * Zl).

Wait, but the load here is complex, 150 + j40 ohms. Oh right, when dealing with complex impedances, the quarter-wave transformer can still be used, but only to match the real parts if I'm not mistaken. Because the transformer only deals with the magnitude of the impedance, not the reactance. So the idea is that if the load has a reactive component, the transformer can't eliminate that, but it can match the real parts.

So the source impedance is 20 ohms, and the load's real part is 150 ohms. Let's calculate the geometric mean: sqrt(20 * 150) = sqrt(3000) ≈ 54.77 ohms. So the transformer's characteristic impedance should be around 54.77 ohms.

Looking at the options, option B says exactly that: sqrt(20*150)=54.77 ohms. So that makes sense. But wait, option A says 100 ohms. Let me check, 20 and 150, does 100 come into play? No, because 100 squared is 10,000, which doesn't match 20*150=3,000. So A is not correct.

Option C is sqrt(50*150)=sqrt(7500)=86.60. Hmm, but 50 isn't the source impedance; the source is 20. So C is incorrect.

Option D says it's impossible. But I thought the quarter-wave can match if the characteristic impedance is set correctly. But wait, the load is complex. So the transformer can match the real parts but not the imaginary parts. So the source will see the load as (Z0^2)/(Zl*) where Zl* is the conjugate. Let me see.

Wait, but when using a quarter-wave transformer, the load impedance as seen by the source is Z0² / Zl. Since Zl is 150 + j40, the conjugate is 150 - j40. So if the transformer's Z0 is sqrt(20*150) = 54.77, then the transformed impedance is (54.77)^2 / (150 - j40). Let me compute that.

54.77 squared is about 3000 (since 54.77^2 ≈ 3000). So 3000 / (150 - j40). Let's compute that. The denominator is 150 - j40. To simplify, multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate, 150 + j40.

So (3000*(150 + j40)) / (150^2 + 40^2) = (3000*(150 + j40)) / (22500 + 1600) = (3000*(150 + j40))/24100.

Compute numerator: 3000*150 = 450,000; 3000*40=120,000j. So numerator is 450,000 + 120,000j.

Divide by 24100: 450,000 / 24100 ≈ 18.67, and 120,000j /24100 ≈ 4.98j. So the transformed impedance is approximately 18.67 + j4.98 ohms. But the source is 20 ohms. Hmm, that's close but not exact. But wait, maybe because I approximated the square roots. Let me check more accurately.

Wait, 54.77 squared is exactly 3000, right? Because 54.77 is sqrt(3000). So 54.77^2 is exactly 3000. So the transformed impedance would be 3000 / (150 - j40). Let me compute that more accurately.

Compute denominator magnitude: sqrt(150² +40²) = sqrt(22500 +1600)=sqrt(24100)=155.2419.

So the transformed impedance is (3000 / 155.2419) * (150 + j40)/155.2419.

Wait, no, more accurately, when you invert a complex number, 1/(a - jb) = (a + jb)/(a² + b²). So 3000/(150 - j40) = 3000*(150 + j40)/(150² +40²) = 3000*(150 +j40)/(24100).

Compute 3000/24100 ≈ 0.12447. Multiply by 150: 0.12447*150 ≈ 18.67 ohms. Multiply by 40: 0.12447*40≈4.979 ohms. So transformed impedance is 18.67 + j4.98 ohms. The source is 20 ohms, which is close but not exact. But wait, perhaps because the load's reactance is not zero, the matching isn't perfect? Or is it?

Wait, but a quarter-wave transformer is only used for matching when the load is purely resistive. Because if the load has a reactance, the transformer can't match both the real and imaginary parts. Oh, right! So if the load impedance is complex, like 150 + j40, a simple quarter-wave transformer can't provide a perfect match because it can only match the real part, not the imaginary part. So in that case, the matching isn't perfect, meaning the voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) isn't 1:1.

Wait, but the question is whether it's possible to design such a transformer. So perhaps the answer is that a quarter-wave transformer can't provide perfect matching because the load is complex. So option D says it's impossible. Let me check the options again.

Option D: A quarter-wave transformer cannot provide perfect impedance matching. So that's correct because the load has a reactance, so the transformer can't match both the real and imaginary parts. So the matching isn't perfect, meaning the source won't see an exact 20 ohm load.

Wait, but earlier I thought option B is correct because it's the geometric mean of the real parts. But if the load is complex, the transformer can't match, so the correct answer would be D.

Wait, let me think again. The quarter-wave transformer can match two impedances if the load is matched at the operating frequency. But if the load has a reactance, the transformer can only match the real parts. So the source impedance would be transformed to Z0² / Zl, but if Zl is complex, the result won't be purely resistive matching the source. So in this case, the source is 20 ohms, and after the transformer, the impedance would have a real part of ~18.67 ohms, which is close but not 20. So it's not a perfect match. Therefore, the correct answer is D.

Wait, but option B suggests that the transformer's impedance is the geometric mean, which is correct for the real parts. But since the load is complex, the matching isn't perfect. So options B and D are both correct in their own ways. But the question is asking whether it's possible to design a quarter-wave transformer to match the source to the load. So if the load is complex, using a quarter-wave transformer can't provide a perfect match, making option D correct.

So looking back, the options are:

A: 100 ohms → wrong.

B: 54.77 ohms → correct for real parts, but overall, the match isn't perfect because of the reactance.

C: 86.60 → wrong.

D: Cannot provide perfect matching → correct.

E: Already matched → no.

F: Need a series inductor → that's another approach, but the question is about the transformer.

G: Can provide perfect matching → incorrect because load is complex.

So the correct answer is D.

The problem involves determining whether a quarter-wave transformer can perfectly match a source impedance of 20 ohms to a complex load impedance of 150 + j40 ohms. A quarter-wave transformer matches impedances by setting its characteristic impedance, \( Z_0 \), to the geometric mean of the source and load impedances. For purely resistive loads, this ensures the source sees the load as its own impedance, achieving perfect matching. However, when the load is complex (with both real and imaginary parts), the transformer can only match the real parts and cannot eliminate the reactive component. 

Calculating the geometric mean of the real parts, \( Z_0 = \sqrt{20 \times 150} \approx 54.77 \, \Omega \), matches option B. However, since the load is complex, the transformer cannot provide a perfect match because it cannot account for the imaginary part (\( +j40 \, \Omega \)). The transformed impedance seen by the source would still have a reactive component, making the match imperfect. Therefore, while the transformer can approximate a match, it cannot achieve perfect impedance matching in this scenario.

Option D correctly states that a quarter-wave transformer cannot provide perfect impedance matching when the load is complex. 

The final answer is **D**.
