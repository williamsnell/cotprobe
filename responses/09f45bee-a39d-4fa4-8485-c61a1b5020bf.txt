D: Chemical X inhibits growth on minimal medium
E: Chemical X is beneficial for the bacteria
F: Chemical X promotes growth on nutrient rich medium only

Okay, so I've got this question about bacterial genetics and mutation rates. Let's try to break it down step by step. 

The question starts by talking about a strain of Salmonella typhimurium that's His^-. I remember that His stands for histidine, and the His^- means it's a mutant that can't produce histidine on its own. These bacteria typically require histidine in their growth medium because they can't synthesize it. 

The spontaneous reversion rate is given as 5 × 10^-8. Spontaneous reversion means the bacteria can mutate back to His^+ at this low rate. So without any treatment, only a tiny fraction of the population would revert.

Now, Chemical X is added to the growth medium. The culture is then diluted and plated onto two different media: minimal medium at 10^-2 dilution and nutrient-rich medium at 10^-3 dilution. After incubation, they count 50 colonies on the minimal medium and 1,000 on the nutrient-rich.

Wait, so minimal medium probably doesn't have histidine, right? Because His^- can't grow there unless they've reverted. Nutrient-rich medium likely has all the necessary nutrients, including histidine, so any bacteria can grow there, including the His^- ones.

Let me think about the numbers. The dilutions are different: 10^-2 for minimal and 10^-3 for nutrient-rich. So the same culture was diluted differently before plating. 

On minimal medium, they got 50 colonies. Since the minimal medium lacks histidine, only the reverted His^+ bacteria would grow. The number of colonies here indicates the number of revertants. Without Chemical X, the expected number would be based on the spontaneous mutation rate. Let's do a rough calculation.

The spontaneous reversion rate is 5e-8 per cell per generation, I think. But how does this translate to the number of colonies? The number of colonies is roughly equal to the mutation rate multiplied by the number of cells plated. 

Wait, but the dilution is 10^-2 for minimal medium. Let's say the culture had N cells. After a 10^-2 dilution, you're plating 1e-2 * N cells. The number of revertants would be 5e-8 * (1e-2 N). But wait, the actual number is 50 colonies. So 5e-8 * (1e-2 N) = 50. That would make N = 50 / (5e-10) ) = 1e12 cells? That seems high, but maybe it's a large culture.

But the key point is that in the presence of Chemical X, the number of revertants is 50 on minimal medium. Without Chemical X, the spontaneous rate would give fewer colonies, but here it's 50. Hmm, so maybe Chemical X is increasing the mutation rate because more revertants are appearing than expected.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The culture was grown with Chemical X. So if the number of His^+ colonies is higher than the spontaneous rate, that suggests that Chemical X is acting as a mutagen, increasing the mutation rate.

Now looking at the nutrient-rich medium, they got 1000 colonies. But since the nutrient-rich medium provides histidine, any bacteria can grow there, including the original His^- and any revertants. So the 1000 colonies would be a mix of His^- and His^+ cells. But the His^- cells can grow because they have histidine in the medium.

Wait, but the dilution is 10^-3 for the nutrient-rich medium. So the number of cells on that plate is higher. But that doesn't directly tell us about mutation; it just tells us about the growth.

So, on the minimal medium, only the revertants (His^+) can grow. And they got 50 colonies. Without Chemical X, the number would be much lower because the mutation rate is 5e-8. So the presence of Chemical X must be causing more mutations, leading to more revertants.

So the conclusion is that Chemical X is increasing the mutation rate, making the bacteria revert more often to His^+. That would mean it's a mutagen. Looking at the options, option J says "Chemical X is highly mutagenic." But wait, does it specifically target the His locus or other genes?

Alternatively, option H says it increases mutation rate for other genes but not His. But in this case, the His mutation rate went up, so H might not be correct.

Option I says it decreases mutation rate, which contradicts the observation.

Alternatively, option E says it's beneficial. But how? Well, if the bacteria are growing better on nutrient-rich medium, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's beneficial overall.

Wait, but the number of colonies on nutrient-rich medium is 1000. If the same culture was diluted 10^-3, that's a higher density than the minimal medium's 10^-2. So that might just be that the nutrient-rich medium supports more growth, but that's not directly about mutation. 

But the key is the number of colonies on minimal medium, which depends on the number of revertants. Chemical X must be increasing the mutation rate to His^+.

So the answer should be that Chemical X is mutagenic, increasing the mutation rate. Looking at the options, J says "Chemical X is highly mutagenic." But wait, is it 'highly'? Because 50 colonies might not be a huge increase, but it's an increase from the spontaneous rate.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal medium had a higher number of revertants than expected. Let me think: without Chemical X, the number of revertants would be much lower. So the presence of Chemical X leads to more revertants, meaning it's acting as a mutagen.

So the correct answer should be J: Chemical X is highly mutagenic.

The experiment involves a strain of *Salmonella typhimurium* that is His^-, meaning it cannot synthesize histidine. The spontaneous reversion rate to His^+ is given as 5 × 10^-8. Chemical X is added to the growth medium, and the cultures are diluted and plated onto minimal medium (10^-2 dilution) and nutrient-rich medium (10^-3 dilution). After incubation, 50 colonies are counted on minimal medium and 1,000 colonies on nutrient-rich medium.

On minimal medium, only His^+ bacteria can grow because histidine is not provided. The number of colonies (50) indicates the number of revertants. Without Chemical X, the number of revertants would be much lower, as the spontaneous mutation rate is 5 × 10^-8. The observed increase in revertants suggests that Chemical X is increasing the mutation rate, likely acting as a mutagen.

On nutrient-rich medium, both His^- and His^+ bacteria can grow because histidine is supplied. The higher number of colonies (1,000) reflects the total bacterial growth but does not directly indicate mutation. However, the key observation is the increase in revertants on minimal medium, which strongly suggests that Chemical X is mutagenic.

Among the options, J: "Chemical X is highly mutagenic" best aligns with the experimental results, as the data indicate an increase in the mutation rate leading to more His^+ colonies.
