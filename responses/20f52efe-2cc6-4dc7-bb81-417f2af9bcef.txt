Okay, so I've got this question about permutations and group theory. The question is asking for the largest order of an element in the group of permutations of 5 objects. The options are A through J, with numbers ranging from 5 to 30.

Hmm, I remember that in permutation groups, the order of an element is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the cycles in its cycle decomposition. So, for example, a permutation that's a single cycle of length 5 would have order 5 because it takes 5 applications to get back to the starting point.

Wait, but maybe there's a way to get a higher order by combining cycles of different lengths. Because the LCM of multiple numbers could be larger than any individual cycle length. Let me think about that.

So, for 5 elements, the possible cycle types are various combinations. Let's break it down. The possible cycles could be:

1. A single 5-cycle. The order here is 5.
2. A 4-cycle and a fixed point. The order would be 4.
3. A 3-cycle and a 2-cycle. The LCM of 3 and 2 is 6. That's higher than 5.
4. A 3-cycle and two fixed points. Order is 3.
5. A 2-cycle and three fixed points. Order is 2.
6. Two 2-cycles and a fixed point. LCM is 2.
7. All fixed points (identity), order 1.

Wait, but wait a second. The question is about the largest possible order. So looking at the options, the 3-cycle and 2-cycle combination gives an order of 6. But wait, is there a way to get higher than 6?

Wait, another possibility: a 5-cycle and a fixed point, but that's just a 5-cycle, so order 5. Alternatively, could we have a 5-cycle combined with other cycles? But since we're only permuting 5 elements, any other cycles would have to be on the same elements, which isn't possible. So the maximum order from a single cycle is 5.

But when combining cycles, like 3 and 2, the LCM is 6, which is higher than 5. So that's better. So 6 is higher than 5, so that's a candidate.

Wait, but are there any other combinations? Let me list all possible cycle structures for permutations on 5 elements:

- (5): order 5
- (4,1): order 4
- (3,2): order LCM(3,2)=6
- (3,1,1): order 3
- (2,2,1): order 2
- (2,1,1,1): order 2
- (1,1,1,1,1): order 1

So among these, the highest order is 6 from the (3,2) cycle type.

Wait, but wait another thought: Could there be a permutation with a cycle structure that gives a higher LCM? For example, perhaps a 3-cycle, a 2-cycle, and a fixed point. Wait, but that's already considered in the (3,2) case since 3+2=5, so that's the only way to split into 3 and 2.

Alternatively, could we have a 5-cycle and a 1-cycle? No, that's just a 5-cycle. So the maximum order from cycle types is 6.

Wait, but let me double-check. Is there a way to have a permutation with a higher order than 6? Let's think of other possible combinations. For example, a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle, which gives 6. Is there any way to get an LCM higher than 6 with 5 elements?

Wait, maybe a 5-cycle combined with a 2-cycle? But no, because a 5-cycle uses all 5 elements, so you can't have a 2-cycle on top of that. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, could we have a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle and a fixed point? Wait, that's the same as (3,2), which we've already considered, giving order 6.

So the maximum order is 6. Now looking at the options, option D is 6. So the answer should be D.

The largest order of an element in the symmetric group on 5 objects is determined by the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of cycles in its decomposition. The possible cycle structures for permutations of 5 elements include single cycles, combinations of cycles, and fixed points. Among these, the combination of a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle yields the highest order, which is LCM(3,2) = 6. Therefore, the largest order is 6.

Answer: D
