Question:

A property owner who owner her property in fee simple leased a three-story house and the 21 -acre tract upon which it stood to a friend for a term of 10 years. By the terms of the lease, the friend expressly covenanted to pay a monthly rental of $300 and to pay the taxes on the premises during the term of the lease. The lease also stipulated that the friend, as lessee, may not assign or sublease the said premises. The friend and his family lived in the house for two years. Then the friend assigned his leasehold interest in the property to a cousin, who was unaware of the prohibition against assignments. This written assignment expressly provided that the cousin would pay the owner the monthly rental of $300, but was silent concerning the payment of taxes. The owner never objected to this assignment. Six months after the assignment, the owner conveyed her property interest in the premises to a developer. During the cousin's tenancy, the State Highway Authority filed proceedings to condemn two acres of the tract for the purpose of highway construction. As a result, the cousin contacted the developer and informed him that he should be entitled to an apportioned reduction in the rental. After the developer refused to reduce the rent, the cousin brings an action to have his rent apportioned pro tanto. Judgment should be for

Options:

A: the cousin, because eminent domain operates as an apportionment of rent.
B: the developer, because the cousin would be held to the original leasehold contract.
C: the developer, because the cousin was not a party to the original lease agreement.
D: the cousin, because the friend violated the terms of the lease by assigning it without permission.
E: the cousin, because the developer did not have the authority to refuse a rent reduction.
F: the developer, as the prohibition against assignments was not known by the cousin.
G: the cousin, because the condemnation proceedings effectively changed the terms of the lease.
H: the developer, although the cousin would be entitled to terminate the lease.
I: the cousin, because the value of his leasehold interest was reduced pro tanto.
J: the developer, because the cousin failed to pay the taxes as stipulated in the original lease.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let me break it down step by step.

So, the scenario involves a property owner leasing her three-story house and 21-acre tract to a friend for 10 years. The lease has specific terms: the friend pays $300 a month and is responsible for the taxes. Also, there's a clause against assigning or subleasing the property.

The friend lived there for two years, then assigned the lease to his cousin without the owner's permission. The cousin didn't know about the assignment prohibition. The assignment was in writing, and it made the cousin responsible for the $300 rent but didn't mention the taxes. The owner didn't object to the assignment, which probably means she implicitly agreed or at least didn't enforce the no-assignment clause.

Six months later, the owner sells her property interest to a developer. Then, the State Highway Authority condemns two acres for highway construction. The cousin tells the developer he should get a rent reduction because part of the property was taken. The developer refuses, and the cousin sues to have his rent apportioned, meaning he wants the rent reduced proportionally.

I need to figure out who wins: the cousin or the developer.

First, let's think about the assignment. The lease prohibits assignment, but the owner didn't object. Typically, a lease can have an anti-assignment clause, but if the lessor (owner) doesn't object, it might be considered a waiver. However, some jurisdictions require a clear waiver in writing. But in this case, the owner didn't object, so perhaps the assignment was effective. But the cousin was unaware, so maybe the assignment is still valid. Alternatively, the anti-assignment clause might still apply, and the assignment could be invalid, making the cousin an unauthorized occupant. But since the owner didn't object, maybe she's treated the cousin as the tenant now.

Next, the condemnation. Eminent domain takes part of the leased property. In such cases, the tenant can request a reduction in rent because part of the property is no longer available. But this depends on the terms of the lease and applicable law.

Looking at the lease, the friend was responsible for paying taxes. The assignment to the cousin didn't mention taxes, but the original lease did. Now, after the assignment, the owner sells her interest to the developer. So the owner is no longer the lessor; the developer is now the owner. The developer is the new party, so the lease terms would still apply unless modified.

The issue is whether the cousin, as the assignee, is bound by the original lease terms. If the assignment was valid, then the cousin is the tenant, and the developer is the landlord. The lease had a term about paying taxes, but the assignment didn't include that. However, the original lease's terms are still part of the lease agreement unless the assignment modified them, which it didn't. So, the cousin would still be responsible for taxes under the original lease.

But the question is about the rent reduction due to eminent domain. Under common law, when part of the leased property is condemned, the tenant is entitled to an apportionment of the rent. However, some jurisdictions require the tenant to be in possession and paying rent under the original lease. If the tenant is an assignee, does that affect their right to apportionment?

In this case, the assignment was to the cousin without the owner's permission, but the owner didn't object. So, the cousin is likely treated as the tenant, and the developer is the new landlord. The condemnation affects the leased premises, so the cousin should be entitled to a rent reduction.

Wait, but the original lease stipulated that the friend (the original lessee) would pay taxes. The assignment didn't include that. So, if the cousin isn't paying taxes, is that a breach? But the issue is about rent reduction, not about tax payment. So, the tax issue might be a separate problem, but it's not directly related to the rent apportionment.

The developer is arguing that the cousin is bound by the original lease. But the cousin is the assignee, so the question is whether the assignment was valid. Since the owner didn't object, maybe the assignment was effective, making the cousin the tenant. Therefore, the cousin is entitled to the apportionment.

Alternatively, if the assignment was invalid because of the anti-assignment clause, the cousin isn't a tenant, and the original lease remains with the friend. But the friend assigned it, so the friend is still liable unless the assignment was effective. But the owner didn't object, which might make the assignment valid despite the clause. Some courts hold that the lessor's failure to object to an assignment can be seen as a waiver, making the assignment effective.

Moreover, the condemnation affects the leased property. The cousin, as the current tenant, would have standing to claim the apportionment. Therefore, the rent should be reduced.

Looking at the options:

A: The cousin is entitled because eminent domain apportions rent. This seems correct if the assignment was valid.

B: The developer wins because the cousin is bound by the lease. But the cousin is the assignee, so he's bound by the lease terms, which include the rent. But the issue is whether the rent can be apportioned.

C: The developer wins because the cousin wasn't a party. But the cousin is a party through assignment, so this might not apply.

D: The cousin wins because the friend violated the lease. But the question is about the developer and the cousin, not the friend's breach.

E: The developer can't refuse a reduction. Well, if the law allows apportionment, the developer can't refuse; but this depends on the lease terms.

F: The developer wins because the cousin didn't know about the assignment prohibition. But the owner's inaction might still make the assignment valid.

G: The cousin wins because the condemnation changed lease terms. This could be a reason, but the main issue is the right to apportionment.

H: The developer, but the cousin can terminate. Not sure about this.

I: The cousin's lease value was reduced. That's a possible reason, but again, the main point is apportionment.

J: The cousin failed to pay taxes. But the issue is rent reduction, not tax payment. The cousin might have breached the lease by not paying taxes, but that's a separate issue from the rent apportionment.

So, the main points are whether the assignment was valid and whether the cousin can claim apportionment.

If the assignment was valid, then the cousin is the tenant, and he can claim apportionment. The condemnation took part of the property, so the rent should be reduced. Therefore, the judgment should be for the cousin, which would be option A.

Alternatively, if the assignment was invalid, the friend remains the tenant, but the friend assigned it, so the cousin isn't a tenant, and the developer could argue that the cousin has no right. But the owner didn't object, so the assignment might be valid.

In some jurisdictions, the anti-assignment clause can be enforced unless the lessor explicitly waives it. If the lessor didn't object, it's a question of fact whether they waived it. But if the cousin was unaware, perhaps the assignment is still invalid unless the lessor's inaction is considered a waiver.

But in this case, the owner conveyed her interest to the developer. So, the developer is the new landlord. The original lease terms still apply, but the tenant is the cousin if the assignment was valid.

Assuming the assignment was valid, the cousin can claim apportionment. Therefore, the answer would be A.

Wait, but the lease stipulated that the friend would pay taxes. The assignment didn't include that, but the original lease's terms are still part of the lease. So, the cousin is obligated to pay taxes, but if he didn't, that's a breach. However, the issue here is rent reduction, not tax payment.

So, the cousin can claim a rent reduction because part of the property was condemned. Therefore, the answer is A: the cousin, because eminent domain operates as an apportionment of rent.
</think>

The cousin is entitled to have his rent apportioned because eminent domain affects the leased property, reducing its value. The assignment was likely valid despite the anti-assignment clause since the owner didn't object, making the cousin the tenant. Therefore, he can claim a rent reduction under the doctrine of apportionment.

Answer: A
