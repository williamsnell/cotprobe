Okay, so I've got this question here about trade discounts. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let me think through it. The question says that the list price of a book is $4.95 and it's sold at a net price of $2.95. I need to find the amount of trade discount. The options are A through J, with various dollar amounts.

Alright, first, I remember that the list price is the original price before any discounts, and the net price is what the store sells it for after discounts. So, the trade discount is the difference between the list price and the net price, right? Or wait, is it the net price after all trade discounts? Hmm, I'm a bit confused because sometimes net price can also include other factors, but I think for this question, it's just the list price minus the net price.

So, let me write that down. List price is $4.95. Net price is $2.95. So, the trade discount would be list price minus net price. Let me calculate that. 

$4.95 minus $2.95 equals $2.00. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check: 4.95 minus 2.95. The cents part is 95 cents minus 95 cents, which is 0. The dollars are 4 minus 2, which is 2. So yes, $2.00. 

Looking at the options, option I is $2.00. So that must be the answer. But wait, is there another way this could be calculated? For example, sometimes trade discounts are calculated as a series of percentages, but in this case, maybe it's a straightforward percentage. I think since the question gives the list and net price, it's just the difference. 

Wait, just to make sure, maybe I should think about it another way. The net price is 2.95, which is less than the list price of 4.95. The difference is the discount. So 4.95 minus 2.95 is indeed 2.00. So the trade discount is $2.00. So the correct option is I.

The correct answer is I: $2.00.

The calculation is as follows: 

List price: $4.95  
Net price: $2.95  
Trade discount = List price - Net price  
Trade discount = $4.95 - $2.95  
Trade discount = $2.00  

Answer: I
