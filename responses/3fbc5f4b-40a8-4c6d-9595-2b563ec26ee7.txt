Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about security definitions, and I need to figure out which one isn't correct. Let me go through each option one by one to understand them better.

Starting with option A: Acting subjects. The definition says it's who or what is acting to produce security or insecurity. That makes sense. I think acting subjects are the agents, like individuals, groups, or entities that take actions to either secure something or create insecurity. So A seems correct.

Option B: Reactive security. It's responding to threats after they've occurred. That rings a bell. Reactive is like a response, so you deal with the threat after it's happened. I remember that proactive is preventing, so B is reactive and that's a correct definition.

Option C: Relative security. It says when a state or individual is safe from threats relative to others. Hmm, relative security is a concept I've heard before. It means you're safer compared to others, not necessarily completely safe. So if others are even less secure, you might feel relatively secure. So C sounds right.

Option D: Absolute security. The definition here is when a state or individual is completely free from all threats. Wait, isn't absolute security a theoretical concept? Because in reality, you can't be completely free from all threats. It's more of an ideal state. So D might be correct, but I'm not sure yet.

Option E: Referent object. It's whom or what we act to make secure. So referent object is the target of our actions, like a nation-state or a person. That makes sense. E seems correct.

Option F: Objective security. It's when a matter is objectively considered a security issue regardless of interpretation. Hmm, objective usually means based on facts, not perceptions. But security can be subjective. So is F correct? Or is it the opposite? Because if something is objectively a security issue, maybe it's based on agreed-upon criteria, not just anyone's interpretation. I'm a bit confused here. I'll come back to F.

Option G: Collective security. Achieved through cooperation of multiple parties. Yes, like how NATO works together to ensure mutual security. So G is correct.

Option H: Proactive security. Preventing threats before they occur. That's the opposite of reactive. So H is correct.

Option I: Substantive content. It refers to what being secure looks like and the conditions needed for it. That sounds like it's about the substance or the actual aspects of security, so I think I is correct.

Now, thinking again about F: Objective security. I think there's a concept called objective security, which is about actual, measurable safety. It's different from subjective, which is how people perceive their safety. So F's definition might be incorrect because objective security isn't about being a matter regardless of interpretation. Instead, it's about actual facts. Wait, the option says "objectively considered a security issue regardless of interpretation." That might be more about subjective or objective assessment. Maybe F is mixing things up. Alternatively, perhaps F is correct because it's about the matter being a security issue factually, not just perceived.

Wait, let me think again. Objective security is when the conditions are such that threats are absent, regardless of how people feel. So if a threat exists, it's objective. But the option F says it's when a matter is considered a security issue regardless of interpretation. That might not be accurate because whether it's a security issue can depend on interpretation. Or maybe F is correct if it's about the actual existence of threats.

I'm a bit stuck on F. Let me consider the other options again. The question is asking which is NOT a correct definition.

Looking back at D: Absolute security is completely free from all threats. In reality, absolute security isn't achievable, but as a definition, it's correct. So D is a correct definition.

So, the incorrect definition would be the one that's either misdefining a term. Let me re-examine F. Objective security is about the actual state, not perceptions. So if F says it's a matter that's objectively considered a security issue regardless of interpretation, that might be incorrect because the interpretation (subjective) can vary, but the objective part is about the actual conditions.

Wait, no. Objective security is about the actual conditions, not the perception. So whether it's a security issue is a matter of fact. So F's definition is correct because it's about the matter being objectively a security issue, not based on how people feel about it.

Hmm, perhaps F is correct. Then which one is wrong?

Looking back at the options, I think all except one are correct. So perhaps the incorrect one is F.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Option F: Objective security is when a matter is objectively considered a security issue regardless of interpretation. That seems a bit off because the term "objectively considered" might imply that it's based on facts, but the way it's phrased might be mixing up the concepts.

Alternatively, perhaps F is correct because objective security is about the actual state, not how it's perceived. So F is correct.

If that's the case, maybe another option is incorrect. Let me check each again.

Option B: Reactive security is responding after threats occur. Correct.

Option F: Maybe it's correct.

Option E: Referent object is correct.

Option I: Substantive content is correct.

So, perhaps the incorrect one is F. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe F is correct, and the incorrect one is another option.

Wait, another thought: Option F says "when a matter is objectively considered a security issue, regardless of interpretation." That might be conflating objective and subjective. Because whether something is a security issue can be a matter of interpretation. For example, climate change is considered a security issue by some, but not by others. So F's definition might be incorrect because it's saying it's objectively a security issue regardless of interpretation, which isn't accurate. It's more about how it's perceived, which is subjective.

So, perhaps F is the incorrect definition because objective security isn't about being a security issue regardless of interpretation. Instead, it's about the actual presence or absence of threats.

Alternatively, maybe F is correct because it's about the matter being objectively a security issue, irrespective of how people interpret it. But I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, I think I might have mixed up the terms. Objective security refers to the actual state of being secure, not the perception. So if a threat exists, it's objective. So the definition in F might not be correct because it's talking about whether it's considered a security issue regardless of interpretation, which is more about subjective definitions.

So, perhaps F is the incorrect definition. Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Alternatively, another approach: looking for the definition that's opposite or misapplied.

Looking again, the options are A to I. The question is which is not correct.

Wait, another angle: Option F says "when a matter is objectively considered a security issue, regardless of interpretation." That sounds a bit contradictory. If it's objectively considered, it's based on facts, so interpretation shouldn't matter. But the phrasing might be off. Maybe it should say "when a matter is objectively a security issue, irrespective of how it's perceived." So perhaps F is correct.

Alternatively, maybe F is incorrect because objective security isn't about being considered a security issue, but about the actual absence of threats.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of each term.

- Absolute security: complete absence of threats. Correct.

- Relative security: safer than others. Correct.

- Reactive: after the fact. Correct.

- Proactive: before. Correct.

- Acting subjects: who acts. Correct.

- Referent object: what is acted upon. Correct.

- Collective: through cooperation. Correct.

- Substantive content: aspects of security. Correct.

- Objective security: actual state, not perceptions. So F says it's when a matter is objectively considered a security issue regardless of interpretation. That might be incorrect because whether it's a security issue can be subject to interpretation. For example, some might see cyberattacks as a security issue, others not. So F's definition is incorrect because it's not necessarily true that it's considered regardless of interpretation.

Therefore, the incorrect definition is F.

The question asks which of the given definitions is not correct. Each option is analyzed as follows:

- **A**: Acting subjects are defined as who or what acts to produce security or insecurity. This is correct.
- **B**: Reactive security is responding to threats after they occur. This is correct.
- **C**: Relative security is when a state or individual is safe from threats relative to others. This is correct.
- **D**: Absolute security is when a state or individual is completely free from all threats. This is a theoretical concept and correct as a definition.
- **E**: Referent object is whom or what we act to make secure. This is correct.
- **F**: Objective security is defined as when a matter is objectively considered a security issue regardless of interpretation. This is problematic because whether something is a security issue can depend on interpretation, making this definition incorrect.
- **G**: Collective security is achieved through cooperation. This is correct.
- **H**: Proactive security is preventing threats before they occur. This is correct.
- **I**: Substantive content refers to what being secure looks like and the conditions for it. This is correct.

The incorrect definition is **F**, as it conflates objective and subjective assessments of security issues.

**Answer: F**
