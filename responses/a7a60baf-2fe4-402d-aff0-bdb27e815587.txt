Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best translation of the sentence "Some CEO is wealthier than everyone." into predicate logic. The options are labeled A through J, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, let me break down the sentence. The statement says that there exists at least one CEO (since it's "some") who is wealthier than every other person. So, I'll need to identify the key components: the existence of a CEO, and that this CEO is wealthier than everyone else.

Looking at the predicates given: Cx means x is a CEO, Px means x is a person, and Wxy means x is wealthier than y.

So, the sentence is about existence. It starts with "some," which in logic usually corresponds to an existential quantifier (∃). So the main structure will be something like ∃x [ ... ] where the ... part describes the properties of x.

Next, the predicate for the CEO: since x is the CEO, we'll have Cx as part of the condition. So inside the existential quantifier, we have Cx.

Now, the second part is that this CEO is wealthier than everyone. "Wealthier than everyone" would mean that for all y, if y is a person, then the CEO (x) is wealthier than y. So that translates to ∀y (Py → Wxy). Because for every person y, x is wealthier than y.

Putting it together, the structure should be: There exists an x such that x is a CEO, and for all y, if y is a person, then x is wealthier than y. So in symbols, that's ∃x [Cx ∧ ∀y (Py → Wxy)].

Now I need to look at the options to see which one matches this structure.

Looking at the options:

Option C: (∃x)[Cx • (∀y)(Py ⊃ Wxy)]
This looks exactly like what I came up with. The existential quantifier applies to x, and inside, it's Cx (x is a CEO) and for all y, if y is a person, then x is wealthier than y. The dot is probably a typo for a conjunction symbol, like ∧.

Option G: (∃x)[Cx ⊃ (∀y)(Py ⊃ Wxy)]
Hmm, this starts with ∃x and then Cx implies something. That doesn't make sense because the existence is about x being a CEO, not an implication. So this would mean that if x is a CEO, then for all y, etc., but we need the existence where x is a CEO and satisfies the condition. So G is incorrect.

Option B: (∃x)[Px • (∀y)(Cy • Wxy)]
Wait, this says there exists an x such that x is a person, and for all y, y is a CEO and x is wealthier than y. That's not right because it's saying all y are CEOs, which isn't the case. The original statement is about a CEO being wealthier than everyone, not that everyone is a CEO.

Option E: (∃x)[Px ⊃ (∀y)(Cy ⊃ Wxy)]
This says there exists an x, such that if x is a person, then for all y, if y is a CEO, x is wealthier than y. That's not the same as saying a CEO is wealthier than everyone. This would imply that any CEO is less wealthy than x, but x is just a person, not necessarily a CEO. So this doesn't fit.

Option J: (∃x)[Cx • (∀y)(Py • Wxy)]
This would mean that x is a CEO and for all y, y is a person and x is wealthier than y. But the second part is incorrect because it's not an implication; it's a conjunction. So it's saying all y are people and x is wealthier than each y, which might work, but the structure is different. Also, the first part is correct, but the quantifier is over y, so it's a bit off because it's not conditional on y being a person. Wait, no, because Wxy is about x being wealthier than y regardless of y's status. But the original statement is about x being wealthier than everyone, which includes all people. So J is saying that x is a CEO and for every y, y is a person and x is wealthier than y. That would require that every y is a person, which isn't the case because there might be non-persons. So J is incorrect.

Looking back, option C is the correct structure. It correctly uses the existential quantifier for the CEO and the universal quantifier for everyone else being less wealthy, with the condition that y is a person.

The correct translation is option C, which captures the existence of a CEO and their wealth relative to all people.

Answer: C
