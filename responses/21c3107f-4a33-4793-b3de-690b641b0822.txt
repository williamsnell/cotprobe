Okay, so I've got this question about a marine research facility testing a ship model. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

The question says they're using a towing basin for models of ship hulls. A new hull shape with a bulbous underwater bow is proposed for a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier that's 300 meters long. They tested a 3-meter model, and the maximum hull speed they found was 1.4 m/s. Now, they want to know what the prototype's anticipated hull speed would be.

Hmm, I remember something about model testing and scaling in naval architecture. There's a concept called Reynolds number similarity, which is important for fluid dynamics in models. Reynolds number (Re) is given by Re = (vL)/ν, where v is velocity, L is length, and ν is the kinematic viscosity of water.

For model testing to be valid, the Reynolds numbers of the model and prototype should be the same. So, Re_model = Re_prototype.

Let me write that down:

Re_model = (v_model * L_model) / ν
Re_prototype = (v_prototype * L_prototype) / ν

Since Re_model = Re_prototype, we can set them equal:

(v_model * L_model) / ν = (v_prototype * L_prototype) / ν

The ν cancels out, so:

v_model * L_model = v_prototype * L_prototype

We can solve for v_prototype:

v_prototype = v_model * (L_prototype / L_model)

Given values:
v_model = 1.4 m/s
L_prototype = 300 m
L_model = 3 m

Plugging in:

v_prototype = 1.4 * (300 / 3) = 1.4 * 100 = 140 m/s? Wait, that can't be right. 140 m/s is way too fast for a ship. Even the fastest ships don't go that speed. Maybe I made a mistake in the scaling factor.

Wait, wait. Oh! Oh, wait a second. I'm mixing up the scaling correctly. Let me double-check the formula. The scaling for speed when Reynolds numbers are matched is v_prototype = v_model * (L_prototype / L_model). So, 1.4 * (300/3) = 1.4 * 100 = 140 m/s. But that's unrealistic. Maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering Froude number similarity instead. Froude number (Fr) is (v^2)/(gL), where g is gravity. For models to predict the prototype's speed correctly, they should match the Froude number. So, Fr_model = Fr_prototype.

So, (v_model^2)/(g * L_model) = (v_prototype^2)/(g * L_prototype)

g cancels out, so:

(v_model^2)/L_model = (v_prototype^2)/L_prototype

Rearranging:

v_prototype^2 = v_model^2 * (L_prototype / L_model)

Take square root:

v_prototype = v_model * sqrt(L_prototype / L_model)

Wait, that's different from before. Let me compute that.

v_model = 1.4 m/s
L_prototype = 300 m
L_model = 3 m

So,

v_prototype = 1.4 * sqrt(300 / 3) = 1.4 * sqrt(100) = 1.4 *10 =14 m/s.

Ah, that makes more sense. 14 m/s is about 50 km/h, which is reasonable for a ship's speed, especially an aircraft carrier.

So, the correct answer is D: 14 m/s.

To determine the anticipated hull speed of the prototype, we consider Froude number similarity, which is crucial for scaling model test results to full-scale vessels. The Froude number is given by \( Fr = \frac{v^2}{gL} \), where \( v \) is velocity, \( g \) is gravity, and \( L \) is length. For the model and prototype to match, their Froude numbers must be equal:

\[
\frac{v_{\text{model}}^2}{L_{\text{model}}} = \frac{v_{\text{prototype}}^2}{L_{\text{prototype}}}
\]

Rearranging for \( v_{\text{prototype}} \):

\[
v_{\text{prototype}} = v_{\text{model}} \times \sqrt{\frac{L_{\text{prototype}}}{L_{\text{model}}}}
\]

Given:
- \( v_{\text{model}} = 1.4 \, \text{m/s} \)
- \( L_{\text{model}} = 3 \, \text{m} \)
- \( L_{\text{prototype}} = 300 \, \text{m} \)

Substituting:

\[
v_{\text{prototype}} = 1.4 \times \sqrt{\frac{300}{3}} = 1.4 \times \sqrt{100} = 1.4 \times 10 = 14 \, \text{m/s}
\]

This speed is realistic for a ship, making the correct answer:

D: 14 m/s
