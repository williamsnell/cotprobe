Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the set E is Lebesgue measurable based on the given condition. The question says that for any closed set F and open set G where F is a subset of E and E is a subset of G, the supremum of m(F) is less than the infimum of m(G). I need to determine if E is Lebesgue measurable, and the answer should be 1 for yes and 0 for no.

First, I remember that a set is Lebesgue measurable if, for any open set G containing it, the measure of G is not too much larger than the measure of the set itself. More formally, the Lebesgue measure is such that the outer measure of E equals the inner measure of E. The outer measure is the infimum of the measures of open sets containing E, and the inner measure is the supremum of the measures of closed sets contained in E.

So, the condition given here is that sup m(F) < inf m(G), where F is closed and contained in E, and G is open and contains E. Wait, that's exactly the situation where the inner measure (sup of m(F)) is less than the outer measure (inf of m(G)). 

If the inner measure is less than the outer measure, that would mean that the inner and outer measures aren't equal, right? Because for a measurable set, the inner measure should equal the outer measure. So if inner < outer, then E isn't measurable.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The inner measure is the supremum of m(F) over all closed F ⊂ E, and the outer measure is the infimum of m(G) over all open G ⊇ E. If inner measure is less than outer measure, that implies that E isn't measurable. Because for a measurable set, the inner and outer measures must coincide.

So, if inner < outer, E is not measurable. Therefore, the answer should be 0, meaning it's not measurable.

But I'm a bit confused because I thought that sometimes certain conditions can make a set non-measurable. Like, for example, the Vitali set is non-measurable. But in this case, the condition given is that inner measure is strictly less than outer measure, which is a direct indicator of non-measurability.

Wait, another thought: Suppose E is such that every open set containing E has measure greater than the sup of the closed sets within E. So, E isn't capturing its own measure properly. Thus, it's not measurable.

So, yes, I think E is not Lebesgue measurable, so the answer is 0.

The set E is not Lebesgue measurable because the inner measure is strictly less than the outer measure, indicating non-measurability.
