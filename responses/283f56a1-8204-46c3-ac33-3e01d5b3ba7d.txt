Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what color Uncle Sam's goatee is. I remember Uncle Sam is a character associated with the United States, right? He's often depicted in patriotic colors. But I'm not exactly sure about the details of his appearance beyond the suit and the top hat.

Let me think about the typical image of Uncle Sam. I think he's usually shown with a white suit, a top hat, and a goatee. Wait, but what color is that goatee? I'm trying to visualize it. I know that the American flag has red, white, and blue, so maybe his goatee is red? Or is it another color?

I remember seeing images where Uncle Sam's hair and goatee are white. That makes sense because he's often portrayed as an older man, and white hair is typical for that. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of any songs or sayings related to Uncle Sam. There's a song called "Yankee Doodle," but I don't think that mentions his goatee color.

Wait, I think the goatee is actually red. Because in some illustrations, the details like the goatee and maybe the hat are in red to match the flag's colors. But then again, I might be confusing it with another character. Maybe it's white because his suit is white, and the goatee would complement that.

I'm a bit confused. Let me try to recall any specific images. I think the goatee is white, but I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, it could be brown or another color. But considering the patriotic theme, red seems more likely. Or maybe it's just a neutral color like grey or black.

Wait, I think I've seen Uncle Sam with a white goatee in some cartoons and posters. That makes sense because white stands out against the red, white, and blue colors of the flag. So, the goatee is probably white.
