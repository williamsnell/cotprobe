Okay, so I have this economics problem here about a monopolist and consumer surplus under perfect competition. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question says that a monopolist can produce at constant average and marginal costs of AC = MC = 5. So both average cost and marginal cost are 5. That probably means that the firm's cost doesn't change with the quantity produced, which is typical for a constant cost structure.

The firm faces a market demand curve given by Q = 53 - P. Wait, usually demand curves are expressed as P = something, but here it's Q = 53 - P. So to make it easier, I think I should rearrange this equation to express P in terms of Q. Let me do that. So if Q = 53 - P, then P = 53 - Q. That makes more sense because price usually depends on quantity.

The question asks to calculate the consumer surplus obtained by consumers under perfect competition, where price equals marginal cost. Under perfect competition, firms produce where price equals marginal cost because there's no profit in the long run; they just cover costs. So in this case, since MC is 5, the price under perfect competition would be 5.

Now, I need to find the consumer surplus. I remember that consumer surplus is the area between the demand curve and the price line, from quantity zero up to the quantity sold. So it's like the triangle or area above the price but below the demand curve.

First, let's find the quantity that would be produced under perfect competition. Since P = MC = 5, and the demand curve is P = 53 - Q, I can set P=5 and solve for Q. So 5 = 53 - Q. Rearranging that, Q = 53 -5 = 48. So under perfect competition, the quantity is 48 units.

Next, I need to find the consumer surplus. The demand curve is P = 53 - Q, and under perfect competition, the price is 5. So the consumer surplus is the area under the demand curve from Q=0 to Q=48, minus the total expenditure at P=5.

Alternatively, since the demand curve is linear, the consumer surplus will form a triangle. The base of the triangle is the quantity, which is 48. The height is the difference between the maximum price consumers are willing to pay and the actual price. The maximum price is when Q=0, which is P=53. So the height is 53 -5 = 48.

So the area of the triangle is (1/2)*base*height = 0.5 *48*48. Let me calculate that. 48 times 48 is 2304, and half of that is 1152. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because I might have messed up the base and height.

Wait, let's think again. The demand curve is P = 53 - Q. At Q=0, P=53. At Q=48, P=5. So the demand curve goes from (0,53) to (48,5). The consumer surplus is the area above P=5 and under the demand curve up to Q=48.

So the base of the triangle is 48, and the height is 53 -5 =48. So the area is (1/2)*48*48 = 1152. But wait, looking at the options, option H is 1152. But I remember that sometimes when calculating consumer surplus, the formula is (1/2)*(P_max - P)*(Q). So let me check that.

Alternatively, another way to calculate it is to integrate the demand function from 0 to 48 and subtract the total revenue (which is P*Q). The integral of P from 0 to 48 is ∫(53 - Q)dQ from 0 to 48. The integral is 53Q - (1/2)Q² evaluated from 0 to 48. So that's (53*48) - (0.5*48²) = (2544) - (0.5*2304)= 2544 - 1152=1392. Then subtract the total revenue, which is P*Q=5*48=240. So consumer surplus is 1392 -240=1152. That matches the earlier calculation.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes I mix up the formulas. Let me think again. Under perfect competition, the price is at marginal cost, which is 5. So the quantity supplied is 48. The maximum price is 53, so the difference is 48, and the quantity is 48. So the area is 0.5 *48*48=1152. So yes, that seems right.

But looking at the options, option H is 1152. But wait, sometimes I get confused between producer surplus and consumer surplus. Wait, no, in this case, it's definitely consumer surplus because we're looking at the area above the price line and below the demand curve.

Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes when I'm tired, I might make a mistake. Let me recalculate the integral method. The area under the demand curve up to Q=48 is the integral of (53 - Q) dQ from 0 to 48. So that's [53Q - (1/2)Q²] from 0 to 48. Plugging in 48: 53*48 = 2544, and (1/2)*48²= 0.5*2304=1152. So the total area is 2544 -1152=1392. Then, the total revenue (which is price times quantity) is 5*48=240. So the consumer surplus is 1392 -240=1152. Yep, that's correct.

So the answer should be H:1152.

The consumer surplus under perfect competition is calculated as the area between the demand curve and the price line. With the demand curve \( P = 53 - Q \) and the price \( P = 5 \), the quantity is 48. The area forms a triangle with base 48 and height 48, giving a consumer surplus of \( \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \times 48 = 1152 \).
