Okay, so I'm trying to solve this calculus problem. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The function f is continuously differentiable on the open interval (-1, 4). That means f is smooth enough in that interval, and its derivative exists and is continuous. We're given that f(3) = 5, and the derivative f'(x) is greater than or equal to -1 for all x in the interval. The question is asking for the greatest possible value of f(0). The options are from A to J, with numbers like 3, 11, 9, etc.

Hmm, so I need to find the maximum possible value of f at x=0, given these conditions. Since f is continuously differentiable, I can probably use some calculus theorems here. Maybe the Mean Value Theorem or something related to differential inequalities.

Wait, f'(x) ≥ -1. That means the slope of the function is at least -1 everywhere in the interval. So, the function can't decrease too steeply. To maximize f(0), I think I should consider how f can increase as much as possible from x=3 to x=0. But wait, moving from x=3 to x=0 is going to the left, so maybe I should think about integrating the derivative over that interval.

Alternatively, maybe using the Mean Value Theorem. The MVT says that for some c between a and b, (f(b) - f(a))/(b - a) = f'(c). But I'm not sure if that directly helps here. Alternatively, maybe I can construct the function that satisfies f'(x) = -1 as much as possible to minimize f(0), but wait, no, we want to maximize f(0). Wait, no, because if f'(x) is bounded below by -1, then the function can't decrease too quickly. Wait, but to maximize f(0), given f(3)=5, perhaps I want f to increase as much as possible from x=0 to x=3, but wait, that's not right because x=3 is to the right of x=0. Wait, maybe I should think about the function's behavior from x=0 to x=3.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. To find the maximum possible f(0), given f(3)=5 and f'(x) ≥ -1. So, the derivative can't be less than -1, which implies that the function can't decrease faster than a slope of -1. So, the minimal rate of decrease is -1. To maximize f(0), I want f to be as large as possible at x=0, so perhaps the maximum occurs when f decreases as slowly as possible from x=0 to x=3, which would be when f'(x) is as large as possible. Wait, but f'(x) is bounded below by -1, not above. So, actually, to maximize f(0), I should consider the case where f'(x) is as large as possible, but that's not bounded here except that it's ≥-1. Wait, but if I want f(0) to be as large as possible, given that f(3)=5, I should think about how much f can increase from x=0 to x=3. Wait, no, because x=3 is to the right of x=0, so if f is increasing from x=0 to x=3, then f(3) would be higher than f(0), but we're given f(3)=5. Wait, perhaps I'm getting it backwards.

Wait, maybe I should use the idea that f'(x) ≥ -1, so the function can't decrease faster than a slope of -1. So, to maximize f(0), I should consider the minimal possible decrease from x=3 to x=0. Wait, but if I want f(0) to be as large as possible, given f(3)=5, then I want f to increase as much as possible from x=0 to x=3. But I'm not sure if that's possible because f'(x) is bounded below by -1, but not above. So, perhaps f'(x) could be very large, allowing f to increase rapidly. But that might not be the case because we're trying to find the maximum possible f(0) given the constraints.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to structure this better.

We know f(3)=5. We want to find the maximum possible value of f(0). The interval from 0 to 3 is to the left, so as x decreases from 3 to 0. To find the maximum f(0), perhaps we can model the function as the "best case" where f increases as much as possible from x=0 to x=3. Wait, but f'(x) is the derivative with respect to x, so if I move from x=0 to x=3, the change in x is positive. So, if f'(x) is large and positive, f would increase as x increases, which would mean f(3) is higher than f(0). But we know f(3)=5, so if f'(x) is positive, then f(0) must be less than 5. But that's not helpful for maximizing f(0). Alternatively, if f'(x) is negative, then f would decrease as x increases, which would make f(3) less than f(0). But wait, f'(x) is ≥-1, so the function can decrease at most with a slope of -1. Therefore, the maximum possible f(0) would occur when f decreases as slowly as possible from x=0 to x=3, which is when f'(x) is exactly -1.

Wait, that makes sense. Because if f'(x) = -1, then the function is decreasing at the minimal rate allowed. So, integrating f'(x) = -1 from x=0 to x=3 would give the maximum possible f(0) given f(3)=5.

Let me write that down. If f'(x) = -1 for all x in [0,3], then the function is f(x) = -x + C. We know that f(3)=5, so plugging in x=3: 5 = -3 + C → C=8. So, f(x) = -x +8. Then, f(0) would be f(0) = -0 +8 =8. So, f(0)=8, which is option H.

But wait, I need to make sure that this is the maximum possible value. Because if f'(x) is greater than -1 somewhere, then the function would decrease less steeply, which would allow f(0) to be larger than 8. Wait, no, because if f'(x) is greater than -1, that means the function isn't decreasing as much, so f(0) would be larger. But wait, that's conflicting with my earlier conclusion.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. If f'(x) is greater than -1, meaning the function isn't decreasing as much, so the function could be higher at x=0. But wait, but we're trying to find the maximum possible f(0), given that f(3)=5 and f'(x) ≥-1.

Wait, perhaps the function can actually increase from x=0 to x=3, which would make f(0) as large as possible. Because if f'(x) is positive, then f increases as x increases, so f(3) would be larger than f(0). But since f(3)=5, if f'(x) is positive, f(0) would be less than 5, which is worse for maximizing f(0). So, the maximum f(0) occurs when f'(x) is as negative as possible, which is -1, because that allows f(0) to be as large as possible given f(3)=5.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. If f'(x) is as negative as possible, then the function decreases as much as possible. Wait, but to maximize f(0), I want the function to decrease as little as possible from x=0 to x=3. Wait, that's the opposite. So, perhaps I should have f'(x) as large as possible (i.e., as positive as possible) to make f(3) as large as possible, but f(3) is fixed at 5. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps using the idea of integrating the derivative. The maximum possible value of f(0) would occur when the integral of f'(x) from 0 to 3 is as large as possible. Since f'(x) ≥-1, the integral would be minimized when f'(x) = -1, but we want the maximum possible f(0). Wait, perhaps I should think of the function f(x) as f(3) plus the integral from 3 to 0 of f'(x) dx. Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of f(0) = f(3) + integral from 3 to 0 of f'(x) dx.

Wait, let me be precise. The function f(x) can be expressed as f(a) + integral from a to x of f'(t) dt. So, choosing a=3, we have f(0) = f(3) + integral from 3 to 0 of f'(t) dt. Since integrating from a higher x to a lower x is the same as the negative integral from lower to higher, f(0) = 5 + integral from 0 to3 of f'(t) dt multiplied by -1. Alternatively, f(0) = 5 - integral from 0 to3 of f'(t) dt.

Wait, correct. Because integral from 3 to 0 of f'(t) dt = - integral from 0 to3 of f'(t) dt. So, f(0) = f(3) + integral from3 to0 f'(t) dt =5 + (- integral from0 to3 f'(t) dt) =5 - integral from0 to3 f'(t) dt.

Now, to maximize f(0), we need to minimize the integral of f'(t) from 0 to3. Because f(0) =5 - integral, so the smaller the integral, the larger f(0) would be.

What's the minimum possible value of the integral of f'(t) from 0 to3, given that f'(t) ≥-1 for all t in [0,3].

The integral ∫₀³ f'(t) dt is minimized when f'(t) is as small as possible. Since f'(t) ≥-1, the minimum occurs when f'(t) = -1 for all t in [0,3]. Therefore, the minimum value of the integral is ∫₀³ (-1) dt = -3.

Substituting back, f(0) =5 - (-3) =5 +3=8.

So, the maximum possible value of f(0) is 8, which is option H.

Wait, but let me double-check. If f'(t) is -1, then f(t) is a linear function with slope -1. So, f(3)=5, so f(t)= -t + C. Plugging t=3: 5= -3 + C → C=8. So, f(t) = -t +8. Then, f(0)=8. That matches.

But wait, could f'(t) be greater than -1 somewhere, allowing f(0) to be larger? No, because if f'(t) were greater than -1 in some regions, then the integral ∫₀³ f'(t) dt would be larger (less negative), which would make 5 - (larger negative) =5 + smaller positive, so f(0) would be smaller than 8. So, the minimal integral (most negative) occurs when f'(t)=-1 everywhere, which gives the maximum f(0)=8.

Therefore, the answer should be H:8.

To determine the greatest possible value of \( f(0) \), we analyze the given conditions. The function \( f \) is continuously differentiable on \((-1, 4)\), with \( f(3) = 5 \) and \( f'(x) \geq -1 \) for all \( x \) in the interval. 

To maximize \( f(0) \), we consider the behavior of \( f \) from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 3 \). Since \( f'(x) \geq -1 \), the function cannot decrease faster than a slope of \(-1\). The maximum \( f(0) \) occurs when \( f \) decreases as slowly as possible, i.e., when \( f'(x) = -1 \) for all \( x \) in \([0, 3]\).

Assuming \( f'(x) = -1 \), the function is linear: \( f(x) = -x + C \). Using \( f(3) = 5 \), we solve for \( C \):
\[
5 = -3 + C \implies C = 8.
\]
Thus, \( f(x) = -x + 8 \), and evaluating at \( x = 0 \):
\[
f(0) = -0 + 8 = 8.
\]

Therefore, the greatest possible value of \( f(0) \) is **8**, corresponding to option H.

Answer: H
