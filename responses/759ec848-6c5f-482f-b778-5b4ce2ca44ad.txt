Okay, so I've got this optics problem here about a crude telescope made from two spectacle lenses. The question has two parts, a and b. Let me try to work through each part step by step.

First, part a asks for the angular magnification of the telescope. I remember that angular magnification for a telescope depends on whether it's a refracting telescope or a reflecting one. Since we're using two lenses, it's a refracting telescope. The formula I think is M = L / S, where L is the focal length of the objective lens and S is the focal length of the eyepiece lens. Wait, but wait—am I mixing up the signs here? Oh right, in angular magnification for telescopes, the formula is M = -(L/S), but the negative sign just indicates the image is inverted, but for magnification, we take the absolute value. So M is positive.

Looking at the given data, the objective lens has a focal length of 100 cm, and the eyepiece is 20 cm. So plugging into the formula, M = 100 / 20 = 5. So the angular magnification should be 5. Let me check the options for part a. So any option with angular magnification 5 is a possibility.

Now part b: Find the height of the image formed by the objective of a building that's 200 ft high and one mile distant. Hmm, so the objective lens is the one with the longer focal length, 100 cm. I think we need to find the image height formed by the objective. I remember the formula for the image height in lens problems is h = (h0 * f) / D, where h0 is the object height, f is the focal length, and D is the object distance.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the formula might be h = (h0 * f) / D, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's h = h0 * (f/D). Let me think again. Oh right, for a thin lens, the image height is given by h = (h0 * f) / D, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the magnification m is given by m = h/h0 = f/D. So h = h0 * (f/D).

Wait, wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me make sure. The formula for magnification is m = f/D, where f is the focal length of the lens and D is the object distance. So the image height h is h = h0 * m = h0 * (f/D).

But wait, I should check the sign conventions. Since the object is beyond the focal length (because D is one mile, which is much larger than f=100 cm), the image formed by the objective is real and inverted. So the magnification would be negative, but since we're talking about height, we'll take the absolute value.

So the building is 200 ft high. I need to convert that to inches or centimeters because the image height is in inches in the options. Let's convert 200 feet to inches first. 1 foot = 12 inches, so 200 ft = 200 * 12 = 2400 inches. Alternatively, maybe the focal length is in cm, so perhaps I should work in centimeters. Let me confirm the units: the focal lengths are given in cm, so maybe the height should be in cm, but the options are in inches, so perhaps I'll convert everything to inches.

Wait, the object distance D is one mile. Let's convert that to centimeters. 1 mile is approximately 160934 cm. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to convert everything into inches. 1 mile is 63360 inches because 1 mile is 5280 feet, and each foot is 12 inches, so 5280 *12=63360 inches.

Wait, but maybe I should use metric units. Let me see. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the ratio without converting units as long as I'm consistent. Let's proceed.

So h0 = 200 ft = 200 * 12 = 2400 inches. The focal length f is 100 cm. Wait, but the object distance D is 1 mile, which is 63360 inches. Wait, but f is in cm and D is in inches. That's a problem because the units don't match. I need to convert them to the same units. Let me convert everything to centimeters.

1 inch is 2.54 cm. So, the object height h0 is 2400 inches, which is 2400 * 2.54 cm. Let me calculate that: 2400 * 2.54 = 6096 cm.

The object distance D is 1 mile = 160934 cm.

So, the magnification m = f/D = 100 cm / 160934 cm ≈ 0.0006206.

Then, the image height h = h0 * m = 6096 cm * 0.0006206 ≈ approx 3.78 cm. Now, convert that to inches: 3.78 cm * (1 inch / 2.54 cm) ≈ 1.488 inches, roughly around 1.5 inches.

So the image height is approximately 1.5 inches.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Calculating f/D: 100 / 160934 ≈ 0.0006206.

h0 is 200 ft = 2400 inches = 6096 cm.

So h = 6096 cm * 0.0006206 ≈ 3.78 cm.

Converting 3.78 cm to inches: 3.78 / 2.54 ≈ 1.488 inches, which is approximately 1.5 inches.

So the image height is about 1.5 inches.

Now looking back at the options, let's see which ones have angular magnification 5 and image height 1.5 inches.

Option A: Angular 5, image 2 inches → no.

Option B: Angular 5, image 1.5 inches → yes.

Option J: Angular 5, image 0.5 inches → no.

So the correct answer should be option B.
</think>

The angular magnification is calculated as \( M = \frac{L}{S} = \frac{100}{20} = 5 \). For the image height, using \( h = h_0 \cdot \frac{f}{D} \), where \( h_0 = 200 \, \text{ft} = 2400 \, \text{inches} = 6096 \, \text{cm} \), \( f = 100 \, \text{cm} \), and \( D = 1 \, \text{mile} = 160934 \, \text{cm} \), we find \( h \approx 1.5 \, \text{inches} \). Thus, the correct answer is:

B
