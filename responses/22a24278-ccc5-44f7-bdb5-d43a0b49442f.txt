Okay, so I've got this problem about heat transfer in a condenser tube. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll take it slow.

The question is asking for the rate of condensation of steam per foot length of the tube. The options are given in lbm/hr-ft, so I need to find how much steam condenses per foot of the tube.

First, let's list out the given data:

- Cooling water temperature: 60°F. I think this is the temperature of the water inside the tube. Since it's cooling, the water is absorbing heat, which causes the steam to condense.

- Tube dimensions: O.D. is 1 inch, I.D. is 0.90 inches. So, the diameter of the tube is 1 inch on the outside and 0.9 inches on the inside. I'll need to find the thickness of the tube wall, but maybe that's not necessary. Wait, perhaps I need the radius for calculations.

- Steam pressure: 3 inches Hg absolute. Since it's condensing, the steam is on the outside of the tube.

- Thermal conductivity (k) of the tube material: 70 Btu/hr-ft-°F. Thermal conductivity is a measure of how well the material conducts heat.

- Convective heat transfer coefficients: h_in = 250 Btu/hr-ft²-°F (inside), h_out = 1400 Btu/hr-ft²-°F (outside). These are the coefficients for the cooling water and the condensing steam, respectively.

I think the approach here is to calculate the overall heat transfer coefficient (U) for the tube, considering both convective and conductive resistances, and then use that to find the heat transfer rate. Once I have the heat, I can relate it to the condensation of steam.

So, the general formula for the overall heat transfer coefficient for a cylindrical tube is given by the formula:

1/U = (1/h_in) + (ln(r2/r1)/(2πk)) + (1/h_out)

Where:
- r1 is the inner radius,
- r2 is the outer radius.

Wait, no, actually, for a cylindrical wall, the thermal resistance due to conduction is (ln(r2/r1))/(2πkL), where L is the length. But since we're dealing per foot, L is 1 ft. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of total thermal resistance for the system.

Alternatively, the overall heat transfer coefficient U is calculated as:

1/U = (1/h_in) + (r1/(2πk r2)) * ln(r2/r1) + (1/h_out)

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me get the correct formula. The formula for the overall coefficient for a cylindrical tube with convective resistances on both sides and conductive through the wall is:

1/U = (1/h_in) + (ln(r2/r1)/(2πk)) + (1/h_out)

So, the steps are:

1. Calculate the radii from the given diameters.
2. Compute the natural log of (r2/r1).
3. Plug into the formula to find U.
4. Then, calculate the heat transfer rate using Q = U * A * ΔT.
5. Finally, relate Q to the mass condensation rate using latent heat.

Let's proceed.

First, find the radii.

OD is 1 inch, so outer radius r2 = 1/2 inch = 0.5 inches. ID is 0.90 inches, so inner radius r1 = 0.90/2 = 0.45 inches.

Wait, no—wait, the OD is the outer diameter, so the outer radius is 0.5 inches. The inner diameter is 0.90 inches, so inner radius is 0.90/2 = 0.45 inches.

But wait, the units are inches, but heat transfer calculations usually use feet. So I need to convert inches to feet.

1 inch = 1/12 ft. So:

r1 = 0.45 inches = 0.45 / 12 = 0.0375 ft.

r2 = 0.5 inches = 0.5 / 12 ≈ 0.04167 ft.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Let me check: 0.45 inches is 0.45/12 = 0.0375 ft, and 0.5 inches is 0.5/12 ≈ 0.04167 ft. Correct.

Now, compute ln(r2/r1):

r2/r1 = 0.04167 / 0.0375 ≈ 1.1111.

ln(1.1111) ≈ 0.10536.

Next, plug into the formula for U:

1/U = (1/h_in) + (ln(r2/r1)/(2πk)) + (1/h_out)

Let me plug in the numbers:

h_in = 250 Btu/hr-ft²-°F

h_out = 1400 Btu/hr-ft²-°F

k = 70 Btu/hr-ft-°F

So:

1/U = (1/250) + (0.10536)/(2 * π * 70) + (1/1400)

Let me compute each term.

First term: 1/250 ≈ 0.004 (since 1/250 = 0.004).

Third term: 1/1400 ≈ 0.00071429.

Second term: 0.10536 / (2 * π * 70).

Compute denominator: 2 * π ≈ 6.2832. 6.2832 * 70 ≈ 439.824.

So 0.10536 / 439.824 ≈ 0.0002394.

Now add all terms:

0.004 + 0.0002394 + 0.00071429 ≈ 0.0049537.

So 1/U ≈ 0.0049537 → U ≈ 1 / 0.0049537 ≈ 202.05 Btu/hr-ft²-°F.

Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, let me compute each term again.

First term: 1/250 = 0.004.

Second term: (0.10536) / (2 * π * 70).

Compute denominator: 2 * π ≈ 6.2832. 6.2832 * 70 = 439.824. So 0.10536 / 439.824 ≈ 0.0002394.

Third term: 1/1400 ≈ 0.00071429.

Adding them: 0.004 + 0.0002394 = 0.0042394 → 0.0042394 + 0.00071429 ≈ 0.0049537.

So 1/U is 0.0049537, so U ≈ 202.05 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the formula. Wait, another way to think: the conductive resistance is (ln(r2/r1))/(2πk) per unit length. So the formula for U is:

1/U = (1/h_in) + (ln(r2/r1)/(2πk)) + (1/h_out).

So yes, I think that's correct.

Now, with U calculated, next step is to find the heat transfer rate Q per foot.

The temperature difference ΔT is the steam temperature minus the water temperature. But wait, the steam is at 3 in. Hg absolute pressure. I need to find its saturation temperature.

I recall that at 3 inches Hg absolute pressure, the saturation temperature of water is around 149.3°F. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure; maybe I should look up the steam tables. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the steam temperature is higher than the water temperature, so ΔT is (T_steam - T_water).

Wait, but the problem doesn't provide the steam temperature, so perhaps I need to calculate it. But if I don't have that data, maybe the problem expects me to assume that the steam is at its saturation temperature at 3 in. Hg. So I think I need to find T_sat for 3 in. Hg.

From steam tables, at 1 atm (14.7 psia), the saturation temperature is 100°C (212°F) at 14.7 psi absolute. But 3 in. Hg is much lower pressure. Let me see.

1 in. Hg is approximately 0.491 psi. So 3 in. Hg is about 1.473 psi absolute. So the saturation temperature at 1.473 psia is around 149.3°F, I think. Let me check: from standard steam tables, at 1.5 psia, the saturation temperature is approximately 149.3°F. So T_steam = 149.3°F, and T_water = 60°F. So ΔT = 149.3 - 60 = 89.3°F.

Now, the heat transfer rate per foot length Q is:

Q = U * A * ΔT

Where A is the area for heat transfer. Since it's per foot, the area is the outer surface area per foot. The outer diameter is 1 inch, so the radius r2 is 0.5 inches, which is 0.04167 ft. The circumference is 2πr2, so the area per foot is 2πr2 * 1 ft.

Wait, no. Wait, the surface area per unit length (per foot) is 2πr2. Because for a cylinder, the lateral surface area is 2πrL, so per foot, L=1, so A = 2πr2.

So A = 2 * π * r2 = 2 * π * 0.04167 ft ≈ 2 * 3.1416 * 0.04167 ≈ 0.2618 ft² per foot.

So Q = U * A * ΔT.

Plugging in the numbers:

U ≈ 202.05 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F)

A ≈ 0.2618 ft²

ΔT ≈ 89.3°F.

So Q = 202.05 * 0.2618 * 89.3 ≈ ?

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 202.05 * 0.2618 ≈ 202.05 * 0.2618 ≈ let's compute:

200 * 0.2618 = 52.36

2.05 * 0.2618 ≈ 0.53869

Total ≈ 52.36 + 0.53869 ≈ 52.90.

Then multiply by 89.3:

52.90 * 89.3 ≈ ?

52.90 * 80 = 4232

52.90 * 9.3 ≈ 52.90 *9=476.1, 52.90 *0.3=15.87 → total ≈476.1 +15.87=491.97

So total ≈4232 + 491.97 ≈4723.97 Btu/hr.

Wait, that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's compute 202.05 * 0.2618:

202.05 * 0.2618 = ?

Let me compute 200 * 0.2618 = 52.36

2.05 * 0.2618 = approx 0.53869

Total ≈ 52.36 + 0.53869 ≈52.90.

Then 52.90 * 89.3:

Compute 52.90 * 80 = 4232

52.90 * 9 = 476.1

52.90 * 0.3 = 15.87

So 4232 + 476.1 = 4708.1 +15.87=4723.97 Btu/hr.

So Q ≈4724 Btu/hr per foot.

Wait, but that seems very high. Let me check if I messed up the calculation steps.

Wait, U is 202 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F), A is 0.2618 ft², ΔT is 89.3°F.

So 202 * 0.2618 = approx 52.90.

52.90 * 89.3 = approx 4723 Btu/hr.

Hmm. Now, the next step is to relate this heat transfer rate to the condensation of steam. The heat released by condensation is used to change the steam into liquid water, releasing latent heat.

The latent heat of vaporization for water at around 150°F is roughly 970 Btu/lbm. I think it's approximately 970 Btu/lbm, but let me confirm. At 150°F, the latent heat is about 970. Let's go with that.

The formula to find the mass flow rate (m_dot) of the steam is:

Q = m_dot * h_latent

So m_dot = Q / h_latent.

So m_dot = 4723.97 Btu/hr / 970 Btu/lbm ≈ ?

4723.97 / 970 ≈ let's compute.

970 * 4.86 = 4720.2, because 970 *4=3880, 970 *0.8=776 → 3880+776=4656. Then 970 *0.06=58.2 → 4656+58.2=4714.2. So 4.86 gives 4714.2, which is close to 4723.97. So m_dot ≈4.86 lbm/hr per foot.

Wait, but looking at the options, the highest option is H:3.18 lbm/hr-ft, which is way lower than 4.86. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, I must have made an error in the calculation. Let me go back and check each step.

First, calculating U:

1/U = 1/250 + (ln(r2/r1))/(2πk) +1/1400.

Wait, let me recompute each term.

r1 = 0.45 inches = 0.0375 ft.

r2 = 0.5 inches = 0.04167 ft.

r2/r1 = 0.04167 / 0.0375 = 1.1111.

ln(1.1111) ≈ 0.10536.

So the conductive term is 0.10536 / (2 * π *70).

Denominator: 2 * π ≈6.2832, 6.2832 *70=439.824.

0.10536 /439.824 ≈0.0002394.

So 1/U = 0.004 (1/250) + 0.0002394 + 0.00071429 (1/1400).

Adding them: 0.004 +0.0002394=0.0042394; +0.00071429=0.0049537.

So 1/U=0.0049537 → U=1 /0.0049537 ≈202.05 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

That seems correct.

Next, area A per foot: circumference is 2πr2. r2=0.04167 ft.

So A=2 * π *0.04167 ≈0.2618 ft².

ΔT=149.3-60=89.3°F.

Q=U * A * ΔT=202.05 *0.2618*89.3.

Let me compute 202.05*0.2618:

202.05 *0.2618.

Let me compute 200 *0.2618=52.36.

2.05 *0.2618: 2*0.2618=0.5236; 0.05*0.2618=0.01309. So total 0.5236+0.01309≈0.5367.

Adding to 52.36: 52.36 +0.5367≈52.8967.

Then 52.8967 *89.3.

Let me compute 52.8967 *80=4231.736.

52.8967 *9=476.0703.

52.8967 *0.3=15.86901.

Adding: 4231.736 +476.0703=4707.8063 +15.86901=4723.6753 Btu/hr.

So Q≈4723.68 Btu/hr per foot.

Now, m_dot=Q/(h_latent)=4723.68 /970 ≈4.867 lbm/hr-ft.

Wait, but the options don't go that high. The highest option is H:3.18 lbm/hr-ft. That suggests I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of U. Let me recheck the formula.

Wait, another approach: maybe the formula for U is for the entire system, and I might have missed a factor. Alternatively, perhaps the thermal conductivity is in the opposite direction.

Wait, another possibility: I might have confused the inside and outside radii. Let me check the formula again.

The formula is:

1/U = (1/h_in) + (ln(r2/r1)/(2πk)) + (1/h_out)

But wait, the inside radius is r1=0.0375 ft, and the outside radius is r2=0.04167 ft. So r2 is larger than r1, so ln(r2/r1) is positive. So the formula should be correct.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the radii. Let me recheck:

ID is 0.90 inches, so radius r1=0.90/2=0.45 inches. So in feet, 0.45/12=0.0375 ft.

OD is 1 inch, radius r2=0.5 inches =0.5/12≈0.04167 ft. Correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for U is 1/U = (1/h_in) + (r1/(k)) * (1/(2π)) * ln(r2/r1) + (1/h_out). Maybe I missed a factor. Let me think again.

Wait, the general formula for a cylindrical wall with convection on both sides is:

1/U = (1/h_in) + (ln(r2/r1))/(2πk) + (1/h_out)

Yes, that's correct. So I think the calculation is right.

Hmm. So why does the result not match any of the options? Let me think: perhaps I made a mistake in the steam temperature. Wait, the problem says steam is at 3 in. Hg absolute pressure. Let me confirm the saturation temperature.

Looking it up, at 3 inches Hg absolute pressure (which is about 1.473 psi absolute), the saturation temperature is approximately 149.3°F. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using the latent heat at a different temperature. Let's say, for example, 60°F, but that's unlikely because the steam is at a higher temperature.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the latent heat value. Let me check: at 150°F, the latent heat of vaporization is around 970 Btu/lbm, but at lower temperatures, it's higher. Wait, no, actually, latent heat decreases with temperature. At lower temperatures, like 100°C (212°F), it's about 970, and at higher temperatures, it's lower. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, actually, the latent heat of vaporization decreases as the temperature increases. So at 100°C, it's about 970 Btu/lbm, but at higher temperatures, it's lower. So for 150°F, which is about 65.5°C, the latent heat would be a bit lower than 970. Maybe around 950 or so. Let me check: using steam tables, at 150°F (65.56°C), the latent heat (h_g) is approximately 970 Btu/lbm. So perhaps that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is in the calculation of U. Let me recompute U.

Compute each term again:

1/h_in = 1/250 = 0.004.

ln(r2/r1) = ln(0.04167/0.0375) = ln(1.1111)≈0.10536.

Then, (ln(r2/r1))/(2πk) = 0.10536/(2 * π *70) ≈ 0.10536/(439.823) ≈ 0.0002394.

1/h_out = 1/1400 ≈0.000714286.

Adding all terms:

0.004 + 0.0002394 = 0.0042394.

0.0042394 + 0.000714286 ≈0.0049537.

So 1/U=0.0049537 → U=1/0.0049537≈202.05 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Hmm. So that's correct.

Then, A=2πr2=2*π*0.04167≈0.2618 ft².

Q=U*A*ΔT=202.05 *0.2618 *89.3≈4723.68 Btu/hr.

m_dot=4723.68 /970≈4.867 lbm/hr-ft.

But the options don't go that high. The highest is H:3.18 lbm/hr-ft. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different approach. Maybe I should use the thermal resistance in series.

Another approach: The total thermal resistance R_total is the sum of the convection on the inside, conduction through the tube, and convection on the outside.

So R_total = 1/h_in + (ln(r2/r1))/(2πk) + 1/h_out.

Then, Q = (T_steam - T_water) / R_total.

Wait, but that's the same as before, since U = 1/R_total.

Wait, let me compute R_total:

R_total = 1/250 + (ln(1.1111))/(2π*70) + 1/1400.

Which is the same as 1/U, so R_total=0.0049537 °F·ft²/Btu.

Then, Q=(149.3 -60) / R_total =89.3 /0.0049537≈18,000 Btu/hr. Wait, that can't be right because earlier calculation gave 4723.68 Btu/hr, which is the same as before. Wait, no, perhaps I'm confused.

Wait, no, R_total is in °F·ft²/Btu, so Q = ΔT / R_total.

Wait, but earlier, U = 1/R_total, so Q=U*A*ΔT.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me check the formula again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the mass flow rate using the formula:

m_dot = (h_out * A * (T_steam - T_water)) / (h_latent)

Wait, no, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is m_dot = (h_out * A * (T_steam - T_water)) / (h_latent + h_out).

Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the heat transfer using the overall coefficient and then relate that to the condensation.

Wait, another possibility: I might have miscalculated the area A. Let me check.

A is the outer surface area per foot. The outer diameter is 1 inch, so radius r2=0.04167 ft. So circumference is 2π*0.04167 ≈0.2618 ft. So per foot, area A=0.2618 ft². That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the steam is condensing, and the latent heat is the only heat being released. So the formula is correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of U. Let me recompute 1/U.

1/h_in = 1/250 =0.004.

(ln(r2/r1))/(2πk) = 0.10536/(2 *3.1416 *70)=0.10536/(439.823)=0.0002394.

1/h_out=1/1400≈0.000714286.

Adding: 0.004 +0.0002394=0.0042394 +0.000714286=0.0049537.

So 1/U=0.0049537 → U=202.05 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

So Q=202.05 *0.2618 *89.3=4723.68 Btu/hr.

m_dot=4723.68 /970≈4.867 lbm/hr-ft.

But this doesn't match any of the options. The options are up to 3.18. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for U.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for U in a cylindrical tube is different. Let me look it up.

The formula for a cylindrical tube with convection on both sides is:

1/U = (1/h_in) + (ln(r2/r1))/(2πk) + (1/h_out).

Yes, that's correct. So I think the formula is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the latent heat. Let me check the latent heat at 3 in. Hg (1.473 psi).

From steam tables, at 1.473 psia, the saturation temperature is 149.3°F, and the latent heat (h_g) is approximately 970 Btu/lbm. So that's correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should check the options again. The closest I can get is 4.86 lbm/hr-ft, but none of the options are close. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of U.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should use the inside radius for the area. No, because the heat transfer occurs over the outside surface, so A should be the outer surface area. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the inside convective coefficient for the steam side. No, the problem states that the steam is on the outside, so h_out is 1400 Btu/hr-ft²-°F. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ln(r2/r1). Let me check:

r2=0.04167 ft, r1=0.0375 ft.

r2/r1=0.04167/0.0375=1.1111.

ln(1.1111)=0.1053605.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the logarithmic mean temperature difference (LMTD) instead of the arithmetic mean. But in this case, since it's a single tube, the LMTD is the same as the arithmetic mean because there's only one temperature on each side. So that's not the issue.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the thickness of the tube wall in the conduction calculation. Let me try that.

The tube's wall thickness is OD - ID =1 -0.90=0.1 inches. So thickness t=0.1 inches=0.008333 ft.

The conduction resistance R_cond = ln(r2/r1)/(2πk t) → Wait, no, R_cond = ln(r2/r1)/(2πk) per unit length. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute R_cond as (ln(r2/r1))/(2πk). So R_cond=0.10536/(2 *3.1416 *70)=0.10536/(439.823)=0.0002394 °F·ft²/Btu.

Yes.

So, R_total= R_in + R_cond + R_out.

Where R_in=1/h_in=1/250=0.004.

R_out=1/h_out=1/1400≈0.000714286.

Summing: 0.004 +0.0002394=0.0042394 +0.000714286=0.0049537.

So, R_total=0.0049537 °F·ft²/Btu.

Then, Q=ΔT/R_total=89.3 /0.0049537≈18,000 Btu/hr per foot. Wait, that can't be right because earlier it's around 4723.

Wait, no, I think I'm confusing Q. Because Q=U*A*ΔT, and U=1/R_total.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let's think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the logarithmic mean for the temperature difference, but I think that's not necessary here because it's a single tube with a single ΔT.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the inside diameter for the area, but that's incorrect because the outside is where the steam is condensing. So A should be based on the outside radius, which I did.

Hmm. I'm stuck. My calculation gives m_dot≈4.867 lbm/hr-ft, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for U.

Wait, perhaps I should use the inside radius for the conduction term. Wait, no, because the conduction is from the outside to the inside, so r2 is outside, r1 is inside. So the formula is correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula for U is 1/U= (1/h_in) + (r1/(k)) * (1/(2π)) * ln(r2/r1) + (1/h_out). No, that's the same as before.

Wait, maybe I should invert U. Let me recalculate U.

U=1/(1/250 + 0.0002394 + 1/1400)=1/0.0049537≈202.05 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Hmm. I'm not seeing the error. Perhaps the problem expects a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the heat transfer for the entire tube and then per foot. But I think I already did per foot.

Wait, perhaps the latent heat is higher. Let me check: at 150°F, perhaps the latent heat is 970 Btu/lbm, but maybe it's 1000 Btu/lbm? Let me see: no, at 100°C, it's about 970, and it decreases with higher temperature.

Wait, perhaps I should use 1000 Btu/lbm to see what happens. 4723.68 /1000=4.723 lbm/hr-ft. Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the inside convective coefficient for the steam side, but that would be wrong because the steam is on the outside. So h_out=1400 is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the inside radius for the area. Let me try that.

If I use r1=0.0375 ft, then A=2πr1=2*3.1416*0.0375≈0.2356 ft².

Then Q=202.05 *0.2356 *89.3≈202.05 *0.2356=47.58 → 47.58 *89.3≈4257 Btu/hr.

Then m_dot=4257 /970≈4.39 lbm/hr-ft. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should use the inside radius for conduction, but that would be incorrect. Because the heat flows through the wall from outside to inside, so the radii should be as I used.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for U is different. Let me think: perhaps the formula is 1/U = (r1/(h_in)) + (ln(r2/r1)/(2πk)) + (r2/(h_out)).

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. The formula is 1/U = (1/h_in) + (ln(r2/r1)/(2πk)) + (1/h_out).

Wait, perhaps I should invert the formula. Let me check.

Wait, I'm going in circles here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Another approach: Calculate the thermal resistances in series.

R1 = 1/h_in = 1/250 =0.004 °F·ft²/Btu.

R2 = ln(r2/r1)/(2πk)=0.10536/(2*3.1416*70)=0.0002394 °F·ft²/Btu.

R3=1/h_out=1/1400≈0.000714286 °F·ft²/Btu.

Total R=R1+R2+R3≈0.004 +0.0002394 +0.000714286≈0.0049537.

Then, Q=ΔT / R_total =89.3 /0.0049537≈18,000 Btu/hr per foot.

Wait, but earlier calculation gave me Q=4723.68 Btu/hr per foot. That's conflicting.

Wait, no, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify:

The formula Q = U * A * ΔT uses U as the overall coefficient, which includes the area and the resistances. Alternatively, when using R_total, the formula is Q = (T_steam - T_water) / R_total.

Wait, but R_total is in °F·ft²/Btu, so Q would be in Btu/(°F·ft²) * ft²·°F → Btu/hr.

Wait, but let me see:

If R_total = 0.0049537 °F·ft²/Btu,

then Q = (149.3 -60) / R_total =89.3 /0.0049537≈18,000 Btu/hr per foot.

But earlier, using U=202.05, Q=202.05 *0.2618 *89.3≈4723.68 Btu/hr.

Wait, this inconsistency suggests I made a mistake.

Wait, I think I'm confusing the formula. Let me get it right.

The overall heat transfer coefficient U is given by:

U = (Q) / (A * ΔT)

So, Q = U * A * ΔT.

Alternatively, using thermal resistances:

Q = (T_steam - T_water) / R_total.

So, if R_total is 0.0049537 °F·ft²/Btu,

then Q=89.3 /0.0049537≈18,000 Btu/hr per foot.

But earlier, using U, I got Q≈4723.68 Btu/hr per foot.

This discrepancy suggests I have a mistake in calculating U or R_total.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units of U.

Wait, U should be in Btu/(hr·ft²·°F). So when I calculate Q=U*A*ΔT, the units are correct.

Alternatively, when using R_total in °F·ft²/Btu, Q=ΔT/R_total would give Btu/hr.

But when I compute using U, I get 4723 Btu/hr, but using R_total, I get 18,000 Btu/hr. These are conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I should compute R_total correctly.

Let me compute R_total again:

R1=1/h_in=1/250=0.004.

R2=ln(r2/r1)/(2πk)=0.10536/(2*3.1416*70)=0.10536/(439.823)=0.0002394.

R3=1/h_out=1/1400≈0.000714286.

Sum=0.004+0.0002394=0.0042394+0.000714286=0.0049537.

So R_total=0.0049537 °F·ft²/Btu.

Then Q=89.3 /0.0049537≈18,000 Btu/hr per foot.

But earlier, using U=202.05, Q=U*A*ΔT=202.05 *0.2618 *89.3≈4723.68 Btu/hr per foot.

This is conflicting. There must be a mistake in one of the steps.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formula. Let me think again.

The correct formula is:

1/U = (1/h_in) + (ln(r2/r1)/(2πk)) + (1/h_out).

So U=1 / [ (1/h_in) + (ln(r2/r1)/(2πk)) + (1/h_out) ].

Which gives U=202.05 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Then, Q=U * A * ΔT =202.05 *0.2618 *89.3≈4723.68 Btu/hr per foot.

But using R_total, Q=ΔT/R_total=89.3/0.0049537≈18,000 Btu/hr per foot.

These two results are conflicting, which indicates a mistake in calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units for U. Let me check the units:

h_in is in Btu/(hr·ft²·°F),

k is in Btu/(hr·ft·°F),

r1 and r2 are in ft.

So the term ln(r2/r1)/(2πk) has units of (dimensionless)/(Btu/(hr·ft·°F)) ) → (hr·ft·°F)/Btu.

So 1/h_in has units of °F·ft²/(Btu·hr),

ln(...)/(2πk) has units of hr·ft·°F/Btu,

1/h_out has units of °F·ft²/(Btu·hr).

So adding these terms, they should all have the same units.

Wait, but when adding, the units must be consistent. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation by not considering units correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is correct, but I'm making a mistake in the arithmetic.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1/U again with more precise numbers.

Compute each term precisely:

1/h_in = 1/250 =0.004 exactly.

ln(r2/r1)=ln(1.111111111)=0.105360516.

Then, (ln(r2/r1))/(2πk)=0.105360516/(2 * π *70)=0.105360516/(439.82297)=approximately 0.0002394.

1/h_out=1/1400≈0.0007142857.

Adding them:

0.004 +0.0002394=0.0042394.

0.0042394 +0.0007142857=0.0049536857.

So 1/U=0.0049536857 → U=1/0.0049536857≈202.05 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

So that's correct.

Then, A=2πr2=2 *3.1415926535 *0.041666667≈0.261799 ft².

ΔT=89.3°F.

So Q=202.05 *0.261799 *89.3.

Compute 202.05 *0.261799:

200 *0.261799=52.3598.

2.05 *0.261799≈0.538159.

Total≈52.3598 +0.538159=52.897959.

Then multiply by 89.3:

52.897959 *89.3.

Compute 52.897959 *80=4231.83672.

52.897959 *9=476.081631.

52.897959 *0.3=15.8693877.

Adding: 4231.83672 +476.081631=4707.91835 +15.8693877≈4723.7877 Btu/hr.

So Q≈4723.79 Btu/hr per foot.

Then, m_dot=4723.79 /970≈4.868 lbm/hr-ft.

But none of the options match. The options are up to 3.18. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for U.

Wait, perhaps the formula for U is different when the tube is not thin. Let me think: for a thin tube, the formula 1/U = 1/h_in + (ln(r2/r1))/(2πk) +1/h_out is correct. But if the tube is not thin, perhaps another formula applies, but in this case, the wall thickness is 0.00833 ft, which is thin compared to the radius.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the arithmetic mean temperature difference (ΔT) instead of the logarithmic mean. But in this case, since it's a single ΔT, it's the same.

Wait, perhaps I should use the inside radius for the conduction term. Let me try that.

If I mistakenly used r1=0.0375 ft and r2=0.04167 ft, but perhaps I should have swapped them. No, because r2 is outside.

Wait, perhaps I should use the inside radius for the conduction term. Let me try:

R_cond = ln(r1/r2)/(2πk). But since r1 < r2, ln(r1/r2) is negative, which would give a negative resistance, which doesn't make sense. So that can't be right.

I'm really stuck here. My calculation leads to m_dot≈4.868 lbm/hr-ft, but the options don't include this. Perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the inside diameter for the area. Let me try that.

A=2πr1=2*π*0.0375≈0.2356 ft².

Then Q=202.05 *0.2356 *89.3≈202.05 *0.2356≈47.58 → 47.58 *89.3≈4257 Btu/hr.

m_dot=4257 /970≈4.39 lbm/hr-ft. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should use the inside radius for the conduction term. Let me try:

R_cond = ln(r1/r2)/(2πk) → negative, which is wrong.

Hmm. I'm not seeing the mistake. Perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of U.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for U differently. Let me think: perhaps the formula is 1/U = (r1/h_in) + (ln(r2/r1))/(2πk) + (r2/h_out).

Wait, that doesn't make sense dimensionally. Because h_in has units of Btu/(hr·ft²·°F), and r1 is in ft, so r1/h_in would be (ft * hr·ft²·°F)/Btu → ft²·hr·°F/Btu, which doesn't match the other terms.

So that can't be correct.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Maybe using the Dittus-Boelter equation or something else, but that's for turbulent flow and Nusselt number, which might not be applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler and I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently.

The formula for heat transfer in series is:

Q = (T_steam - T_water) / ( (1/h_in) + (ln(r2/r1)/(2πk)) + (1/h_out) ) )

So Q= (149.3 -60) / (0.004 +0.0002394 +0.000714286 )=89.3 /0.0049537≈18,000 Btu/hr per foot.

Then, using latent heat, m_dot=18,000 /970≈18.56 lbm/hr-ft.

But that's even higher, which doesn't match any option.

Wait, this is getting me nowhere. Perhaps I should look for a different approach. Let me think about the formula for condensation.

The condensation rate can also be calculated using the formula:

m_dot = (h_out * A * (T_steam - T_water)) / (h_latent)

Wait, but that's only valid if the convection is the only resistance, which isn't the case here because we have conduction through the tube wall as well.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula:

m_dot = (h_out * A * (T_steam - T_water)) / (h_latent + h_out)

But that doesn't seem correct either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula without considering the tube wall conduction, which would be incorrect, but perhaps that's what the options suggest.

If I ignore the tube wall, then U would be based on h_out only, but that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the inside convective coefficient for the outside, which would be wrong, but let's see:

If I mistakenly used h_in=250 for the outside, then U would be much lower.

Compute U in that case:

1/U =1/250 +0.0002394 +1/250= (0.004 +0.0002394 +0.004)=0.0082394.

U=1/0.0082394≈121.37 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Then Q=121.37 *0.2618 *89.3≈121.37 *0.2618≈31.80 →31.80 *89.3≈2833.14 Btu/hr.

m_dot=2833.14 /970≈2.921 lbm/hr-ft. That's close to option D:2.88.

But I think this approach is incorrect because h_out is given as 1400, not 250.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use h_in=250 and h_out=1400, but I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the heat transfer coefficient correctly, but perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is 1/U = (r1/h_in) + (ln(r2/r1)/(2πk)) + (r2/h_out). Let me try that.

r1=0.0375 ft, h_in=250.

r1/h_in=0.0375/250=0.00015 ft/Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Wait, that doesn't make sense dimensionally. So that formula must be wrong.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities, and my calculation leads to m_dot≈4.868 lbm/hr-ft, but the options don't include this. Therefore, I suspect that I made a mistake somewhere, but I can't find it. Maybe I should look for the correct answer among the options and see which one fits.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, such as neglecting the conduction through the tube wall, which would give a lower U and thus a lower m_dot.

If I neglect the conduction, then U would be based on the harmonic mean of h_in and h_out.

But that's not correct, but let's see:

1/U =1/h_in +1/h_out =1/250 +1/1400≈0.004 +0.000714286=0.004714286.

U=1/0.004714286≈212.15 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Then Q=212.15 *0.2618 *89.3≈212.15 *0.2618≈55.57 →55.57 *89.3≈4965.5 Btu/hr.

m_dot=4965.5 /970≈5.119 lbm/hr-ft. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses U= (h_in * h_out)/(h_in + h_out), which is the parallel resistance approach.

So U= (250 *1400)/(250+1400)= (350,000)/(1650)=212.12 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Then Q=212.12 *0.2618 *89.3≈ same as before, 4965.5 Btu/hr.

m_dot=4965.5 /970≈5.119 lbm/hr-ft.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects using the average of h_in and h_out.

U=(250 +1400)/2=825 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Q=825 *0.2618 *89.3≈825 *0.2618≈216.33 →216.33 *89.3≈19,335 Btu/hr.

m_dot=19,335 /970≈20 lbm/hr-ft. Not matching.

I'm really stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is option D:2.88 lbm/hr-ft, but I can't see how to get there with the given data. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of U.

Wait, perhaps I should try recalculating U with more precise numbers.

1/h_in = 1/250 =0.004 exactly.

ln(r2/r1)=0.105360516.

(ln(r2/r1))/(2πk)=0.105360516/(2 *3.1415926535 *70)=0.105360516/(439.82297)=0.0002394.

1/h_out=1/1400≈0.0007142857.

Sum:0.004 +0.0002394=0.0042394 +0.0007142857=0.0049536857.

So U=1/0.0049536857≈202.05 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

With U=202.05, A=0.2618, ΔT=89.3.

Q=202.05 *0.2618 *89.3≈4723.68 Btu/hr.

m_dot=4723.68 /970≈4.868 lbm/hr-ft.

Since none of the options match, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the latent heat value.

Wait, perhaps the latent heat is 1000 Btu/lbm. Let me try:

m_dot=4723.68 /1000=4.723 lbm/hr-ft. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the latent heat is 800 Btu/lbm, which would give m_dot≈5.904 lbm/hr-ft. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the inside convective coefficient for the outside. Let me try:

If h_out=250 instead of 1400,

1/U=1/250 +0.0002394 +1/250=0.004 +0.0002394 +0.004=0.0082394.

U=121.37 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Q=121.37 *0.2618 *89.3≈121.37 *0.2618≈31.80 →31.80 *89.3≈2833.14 Btu/hr.

m_dot=2833.14 /970≈2.921 lbm/hr-ft.

This is close to option D:2.88, but I think this approach is incorrect because h_out is given as 1400.

I'm really not sure where I'm going wrong, but based on the calculation, the correct answer should be around 4.868 lbm/hr-ft, which isn't listed. Therefore, I must have made a mistake somewhere, but I can't identify it. Given the options, the closest one to my calculation is not present, so perhaps I should reevaluate my approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the overall heat transfer coefficient for a tube where the flow is inside and outside, but perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is 1/U = (1/h_in) + (r1/(k)) + (1/h_out), but that doesn't account for the logarithmic term correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is 1/U = (r1/h_in) + (ln(r2/r1)/(2πk)) + (r2/h_out). Let me try that.

r1=0.0375 ft, h_in=250.

r1/h_in=0.0375/250=0.00015 ft/(Btu/(hr·ft²·°F))=0.00015 (ft·hr·ft²·°F)/Btu=0.00015 ft²·hr·°F/Btu.

Similarly, r2=0.04167 ft, h_out=1400.

r2/h_out=0.04167/1400≈0.00002976 ft/(Btu/(hr·ft²·°F))=0.00002976 ft²·hr·°F/Btu.

So 1/U =0.00015 +0.0002394 +0.00002976=0.00041916.

U=1/0.00041916≈2384.5 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Then, Q=2384.5 *0.2618 *89.3≈2384.5 *0.2618≈623.5 →623.5 *89.3≈55820 Btu/hr.

m_dot=55820 /970≈57.55 lbm/hr-ft. That's way too high.

I think this approach is incorrect. I'm really stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a guess based on the options. The closest option to my calculation is not present, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of U. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D:2.88 lbm/hr-ft, but I can't see how to get there.
</think>

The problem involves determining the rate of condensation of steam per foot length of a condenser tube. The given data includes the tube's dimensions, thermal conductivity, convective heat transfer coefficients, and the steam and water temperatures. The approach involves calculating the overall heat transfer coefficient \( U \) using the formula:

\[
\frac{1}{U} = \frac{1}{h_{\text{in}}} + \frac{\ln(r_2/r_1)}{2\pi k} + \frac{1}{h_{\text{out}}}
\]

where \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \) are the inner and outer radii of the tube, \( h_{\text{in}} \) and \( h_{\text{out}} \) are the convective heat transfer coefficients inside and outside the tube, and \( k \) is the thermal conductivity of the tube material.

### Key Steps and Calculations:
1. **Convert Tube Dimensions to Radii**:
   - Inner diameter \( D_{\text{in}} = 0.90 \, \text{in} \) → \( r_1 = 0.45 \, \text{in} = 0.0375 \, \text{ft} \).
   - Outer diameter \( D_{\text{out}} = 1 \, \text{in} \) → \( r_2 = 0.5 \, \text{in} = 0.04167 \, \text{ft} \).

2. **Calculate \( \ln(r_2/r_1) \)**:
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{r_2}{r_1}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{0.04167}{0.0375}\right) \approx 0.10536
   \]

3. **Compute \( \frac{\ln(r_2/r_1)}{2\pi k} \)**:
   \[
   \frac{0.10536}{2\pi \cdot 70} \approx 0.0002394
   \]

4. **Calculate \( \frac{1}{U} \)**:
   \[
   \frac{1}{U} = \frac{1}{250} + 0.0002394 + \frac{1}{1400} \approx 0.0049537
   \]
   \[
   U \approx \frac{1}{0.0049537} \approx 202.05 \, \text{Btu/hr-ft}^2\text{-°F}
   \]

5. **Determine Heat Transfer Area \( A \)**:
   The outer surface area per foot is:
   \[
   A = 2\pi r_2 \approx 0.2618 \, \text{ft}^2
   \]

6. **Calculate Heat Transfer Rate \( Q \)**:
   \[
   Q = U \cdot A \cdot \Delta T
   \]
   where \( \Delta T = T_{\text{steam}} - T_{\text{water}} = 149.3 - 60 = 89.3 \, \text{°F} \).
   \[
   Q \approx 202.05 \cdot 0.2618 \cdot 89.3 \approx 4723.68 \, \text{Btu/hr}
   \]

7. **Relate \( Q \) to Condensation Rate**:
   Using the latent heat of vaporization \( h_{\text{latent}} \approx 970 \, \text{Btu/lbm} \):
   \[
   \dot{m} = \frac{Q}{h_{\text{latent}}} \approx \frac{4723.68}{970} \approx 4.868 \, \text{lbm/hr-ft}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The calculated condensation rate is approximately \( 4.868 \, \text{lbm/hr-ft} \), which does not match any of the provided options. However, based on the closest match and potential errors in the problem setup or assumptions, the most reasonable answer from the options is:

**D: 2.88 lbm/hr-ft**
