Question:

Apoptosis, which is programmed cell death, is a necessary process in living organisms. Which of the following is NOT correct about apoptosis?

Options:

A: It occurs randomly.
B: A particular cell dies when it is no longer needed by the organism.
C: A cell carries out apoptosis when too many mutations have accumulated.
D: Plant cells carry out apoptosis as a defense measure in cells that have been infected by parasites.

Answer:

Okay, so I have this question about apoptosis, which I know is programmed cell death. The question is asking which statement is NOT correct about apoptosis. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A says it occurs randomly. Hmm, wait. Apoptosis is a programmed process, right? So it's not random. It's controlled by the cell's genetic machinery. So if this option says it's random, that's probably incorrect.

Option B states that a cell dies when it's no longer needed. That makes sense because during development, cells are programmed to die when they're not needed anymore. Like how fingers form in embryos by apoptosis of the cells between them. So B is correct.

Option C mentions a cell undergoing apoptosis when too many mutations have accumulated. Well, I think apoptosis usually occurs when the cell detects damage, like mutations, to prevent cancer. So this is correct because cells with too many mutations would trigger apoptosis to prevent them from becoming cancerous.

Option D says plant cells use apoptosis as a defense against parasites. I'm not entirely sure about this one. Do plants use apoptosis for defense? I know that in animals, apoptosis is part of immune responses, but in plants, maybe they have other ways. Or perhaps they do use it. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Alternatively, maybe plants use something called programmed cell death to isolate pathogens, kind of like how some plants form tyloses to block off infected areas. So maybe D is correct.

Wait, but the question is about what's NOT correct. So if A says it's random, that's wrong because it's programmed. So the incorrect statement is A.

The incorrect statement about apoptosis is that it occurs randomly, as apoptosis is a controlled, programmed process.
