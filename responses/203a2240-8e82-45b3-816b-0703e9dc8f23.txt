Okay, so I have this question about Sikhism, and I'm trying to figure out where the key to liberation is found. The options are from A to J. I'm a bit new to Sikhism, so I'll need to think carefully.

First, I remember that Sikhism was founded by Guru Nanak. The core teachings, as far as I know, revolve around the concept of "Sikhi," which is about seeking liberation or union with God. Liberation in many religions often involves some form of devotion, meditation, or righteous living.

Looking at the options, option A is "In faith in God." That sounds important because Sikhism is a monotheistic religion, and faith is a big part of it. But is that the key? Or is it more about action than just faith?

Option B is "In the strict adherence to the Five Ks." The Five Ks are Kesh (uncut hair), Kangha (a wooden comb), Kirtan (a small sword), Kachera (cotton undergarment), and Kara (a steel bracelet). These are symbols of Sikh identity, but are they the key to liberation? I think they're more about living a truthful and moral life as a Sikh, but maybe not the direct path to liberation.

Option C is "In ascetic renunciation." I don't think Sikhism promotes renouncing the world. In fact, many Sikhs are householder saints, meaning they lead normal family lives but strive for righteousness.

Option D is "In the practice of yoga and other physical disciplines." Yoga is more associated with Hinduism, especially in the context of meditation and physical postures. While meditation is part of Sikhism, the physical aspects like yoga aren't as emphasized as in some other traditions.

Option E is "In acts of charity and service." Sikhism does stress seva, which is selfless service, but is that the key to liberation? It's important, but maybe not the primary focus.

Option F is "In the community." Community is definitely a big part of Sikhism, especially through the Gurdwara and langar (community kitchen). But is the community the key to liberation, or more a support system?

Option G is "In meditation and prayer." This seems plausible because meditation is a way to connect with God. In Sikhism, meditating on God's name (Naam simran) is a key practice for liberation.

Option H is "In the rejection of all worldly possessions." Again, I think Sikhism teaches to live a normal life without attachment. Rejecting everything seems more like an extreme ascetic view, not central to Sikh teachings.

Option I is "In the life of the householder." This makes sense because many Sikhs are householders and lead normal lives but maintain their spiritual practices. The idea is to balance the spiritual and worldly life.

So, putting it together, liberation in Sikhism is about living a balanced life, being truthful, and meditating on God's name. The key practices would include faith, meditation, and living a moral life as a householder. 

Looking back, the question is about where the key is found. I think it's more about the internal practices like meditation and prayer (option G) rather than external things like the Five Ks or community, though those are important too. Or maybe it's about the householder life (option I) because that's where one applies their faith and practices in daily living.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The key to liberation is often about the path taken. In Sikhism, the path includes faith, meditation, and living a righteous life as a householder. So maybe the key is in the householder life because it's the practical application. Or is it meditation and prayer?

I think both G and I are possible. But I recall that the Sikh Gurus emphasized the importance of meditating on God's name, which is a form of prayer and meditation, as the way to liberation. So perhaps option G is the answer.

Alternatively, the householder life (I) might encapsulate the idea of living a balanced life with both spiritual and worldly responsibilities, which is the Sikh ideal. But I'm not sure if it's the key to liberation itself or just a way of life.

Wait, the question is about where the key is found. The key is more about the practice that leads to liberation. So meditation and prayer (G) are the practices that lead to liberation. The householder life is a context where these practices are lived out.

So I think the answer is G: In meditation and prayer.

The key to liberation in Sikhism is found in the practice of meditation and prayer, as these are the means to connect with God and attain spiritual awakening. 

Answer: G
