Okay, so I've got this question about machine learning concepts, specifically about the shattering of sets by rectangles and the VC-dimension of the k-Nearest Neighbour classifier when k=1. Hmm, let me try to think through this.

First, I'll tackle Statement 1: The set of all rectangles in the 2D plane (including non-axis-aligned rectangles) can shatter a set of 5 points. 

Wait, shattering in machine learning terms means that the set of classifiers can realize every possible labeling of the points. For rectangles, the VC-dimension is the maximum number of points that can be shattered. I remember that for axis-aligned rectangles, the VC-dimension is 4. But wait, the question is about all rectangles, not just axis-aligned ones. So non-axis-aligned rectangles are more flexible because they can be rotated. Do they have a higher VC-dimension?

I think the VC-dimension for general rectangles (any orientation) is 5. Because with axis-aligned, it's 4, but allowing rotation can shatter more points. So if a set of 5 points can be shattered by rectangles, then Statement 1 is true. Or wait, does it really go up to 5? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, maybe it's still 4 because the VC-dimension is determined by the maximum set that can be shattered regardless of the specific points. So if any 5 points can be shattered, then the VC-dimension is at least 5. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, I think the VC-dimension for general rectangles is 5. So yes, they can shatter 5 points. So Statement 1 is true.

Next, Statement 2: The VC-dimension of k-Nearest Neighbour classifier when k=1 is infinite. Wait, when k=1, it's the same as the 1-NN classifier. The VC-dimension for 1-NN is known to be infinite. Because 1-NN can shatter any finite set of points. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, the VC-dimension is the maximum number of points that can be shattered. For 1-NN, the VC-dimension is actually infinite because it can shatter any set of points, regardless of how they're placed. So yes, the VC-dimension is infinite. So Statement 2 is true.

Wait, but wait a minute. I thought the VC-dimension for 1-NN is actually 3 in some contexts, but that's for a different setup. No, no, I'm confusing things. Let me think again. The k-NN classifier when k=1 is sensitive to the arrangement of the points. If the points are in general position, 1-NN can shatter them. So yes, its VC-dimension is indeed infinite because it can shatter any finite set. So Statement 2 is true.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain about the VC-dimension of 1-NN. I think it's known that the VC-dimension of k-NN is infinite for any k. Wait, no, no. Wait, for k=1, the VC-dimension can indeed be infinite because the classifier can separate points in any way, making it able to shatter any set. So yes, Statement 2 is true.

So if both statements are true, the answer would be A: True, True. But let me double-check.

Wait, for the first statement, I remember that the VC-dimension for rectangles (any orientation) is 5. So if the set of 5 points can be shattered, then the statement is true. So Statement 1 is correct. So both statements are true, so the correct answer is A.

The set of all rectangles in the 2D plane, including non-axis-aligned ones, can shatter a set of 5 points, making Statement 1 true. The VC-dimension of the 1-Nearest Neighbour classifier is infinite, so Statement 2 is also true.

Answer: A
