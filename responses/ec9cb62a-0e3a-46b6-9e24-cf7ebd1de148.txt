Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about role-learning theory, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I remember that role-learning theory is related to how individuals acquire social roles through their interactions and experiences in society. I think it's a concept from sociology or psychology, maybe Bandura's social learning theory? Because I recall that Bandura talked about learning through observation and modeling.

Looking at the options:

A: we learn our roles through observation only. Hmm, while observation is a part of it, I'm not sure if it's the only way. People also learn through other means like trial and error or teaching.

B: roles are learned through punishment and reward system. That sounds more like operant conditioning from behaviorism. I'm not sure if role-learning theory specifically uses this, though. Maybe, but I think it's more about modeling and observing.

C: social roles are fixed and singular. That doesn't sound right. Social roles can vary a lot depending on culture and context, so fixed and singular doesn't fit.

D: role-learning theory is not related to social roles but to professional roles. I don't think that's correct. I'm pretty sure it's about social roles in general, not just professional ones.

E: we internalise and take on social roles from a pre-existing framework. This rings a bell. I think role-learning theory suggests that we internalize roles based on the society we're in, which already has frameworks for roles. So this might be the right answer.

F: roles have to be learned to suppress unconscious motivations. That sounds more like something from psychoanalysis, not sure about role theory.

G: social roles are predetermined and cannot be changed. No, because roles can change over time and vary between different groups.

H: roles are not learned but are innate to each individual. That's the opposite of learning theories. Role-learning theory is about acquiring roles through experience, so this can't be right.

So, putting it together, the correct answer should be E. It talks about internalizing roles from a pre-existing framework, which aligns with how role-learning theory works. Observing others, imitating them, and then internalizing those behaviors as part of our own role in society.
