Okay, so I've got this question about logical fallacies, and I need to figure out which one applies. Let me read it again.

The question says: "Which fallacy happens when someone argues in favor of a two part proposition, only supports one part of the proposition, then asserts that the entire proposition has been supported." The options are A through J, but in the given options, I see A: a priori, B: Complex proposition, C: Extension, D: Appeal to ignorance. Hmm, wait, maybe the options are just these four, but the answer is one of them.

Wait, no, looking back, the user provided options A to J, but in the answer section, the options listed are only A to D, but perhaps that's a typo. Anyway, focusing on the question.

So, the scenario is someone supports only part of a two-part proposition and then claims the whole is supported. That sounds familiar. I think it's called the "complex question" fallacy. Or maybe "appeal to extremes"? Wait, no, another thought: it's similar to the "straw man" fallacy, but that's when you misrepresent someone's argument. No, that's not it.

Wait, another angle: when someone presents two parts and only supports one, thinking that's enough. That might be the "appeal to the complex" fallacy. Or perhaps it's called the "false dichotomy." Wait, no, false dichotomy is when you present two options as the only possibilities when more exist.

Wait, I think it's the "complex proposition" fallacy. Because the person is treating a compound proposition as if supporting one part supports the whole. So, for example, if someone says "We should lower taxes and increase military spending because lowering taxes will boost the economy," they're assuming that supporting one part (lowering taxes) supports the entire proposition (both parts). That's the complex proposition fallacy, sometimes also known as the "complex question" or "loaded question" fallacy.

Wait, but I might be mixing terms. Let me think again. The complex question fallacy is when you ask a question that assumes something that hasn't been proven, like "Have you stopped beating your wife?" which implies you were doing it before. But that's more about questioning.

Alternatively, the "appeal to extremes" fallacy is when you take an argument to an extreme, but that's not exactly this scenario.

Wait, another possibility: the "eclectic fallacy" or "fallacy of composition." No, that's when you assume what's true of parts is true of the whole.

Wait, no, the fallacy in question is when someone supports only part of a proposition and claims the whole is supported. That's called the "complex proposition" fallacy. So the answer should be B: Complex proposition.

Wait, but looking at the options given, B is "Complex proposition." So that's probably the correct answer.

The fallacy described occurs when someone supports only one part of a two-part proposition and then claims the entire proposition is supported. This is known as the "complex proposition" fallacy, where a compound proposition is treated as if supporting one part supports the whole. 

Answer: B
