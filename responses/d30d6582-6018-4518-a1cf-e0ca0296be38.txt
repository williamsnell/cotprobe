Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the mole fraction of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) when it's dissolved in water with a weight percent of 50%. Hmm, I've heard about mole fractions before, but I'm a bit rusty on the exact steps to calculate it. Let me think through this carefully.

First, I remember that mole fraction is the ratio of the number of moles of a substance to the total number of moles in the mixture. So, in this case, I need to find the moles of NaOH and the moles of water, then add them together for the total moles, and then divide the moles of NaOH by that total.

The problem gives me the weight percent of NaOH as 50%, which means that in a 100-gram solution, 50 grams are NaOH and the remaining 50 grams are water. That's a good starting point because it's easy to work with 100 grams.

So, I'll take 50 grams of NaOH and 50 grams of water. Next, I need to find out how many moles each of these substances is. To find moles, I use the formula: moles = mass (g) / molar mass.

Let me look up the molar masses. The molar mass of NaOH is calculated by adding the atomic masses of Na, O, and H. Sodium (Na) is about 23 g/mol, oxygen (O) is 16 g/mol, and hydrogen (H) is 1 g/mol. So, 23 + 16 + 1 equals 40 g/mol for NaOH.

For water (H2O), the molar mass is 2*(1) + 16 = 18 g/mol.

Now, calculating the moles of NaOH: 50 g / 40 g/mol = 1.25 moles.

And the moles of water: 50 g / 18 g/mol ≈ 2.7778 moles. Let me double-check that calculation. 50 divided by 18 is about 2.7778, yes.

So, the total moles in the solution are moles of NaOH plus moles of water: 1.25 + 2.7778 ≈ 4.0278 moles.

Now, the mole fraction of NaOH is moles of NaOH divided by total moles. So that's 1.25 / 4.0278. Let me compute that. 

Hmm, 1.25 divided by 4 is 0.3125, but since the denominator is a bit more than 4, the result will be slightly less than 0.3125. Let me do the exact division: 1.25 ÷ 4.0278 ≈ 0.310.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.311, which is very close to my calculated value of approximately 0.310. So, I think option A is the correct answer.

Wait, did I make any mistakes in the calculations? Let me go through again.

Mass of NaOH: 50g, molar mass 40g/mol. 50/40 = 1.25 moles. Correct.

Mass of water: 50g, molar mass 18g/mol. 50/18 ≈ 2.7778 moles. Correct.

Total moles: 1.25 + 2.7778 ≈ 4.0278. Correct.

Mole fraction: 1.25 / 4.0278 ≈ 0.310. So, 0.311 is the closest option, which is option A.

To determine the mole fraction of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in a 50% weight percent solution, we first calculate the moles of NaOH and water. Assuming a 100-gram solution, 50 grams are NaOH and 50 grams are water. The molar mass of NaOH is 40 g/mol, so moles of NaOH = 50/40 = 1.25 moles. For water, the molar mass is 18 g/mol, so moles of water = 50/18 ≈ 2.778 moles. The total moles are 1.25 + 2.778 ≈ 4.028 moles. The mole fraction of NaOH is 1.25 / 4.028 ≈ 0.310, which rounds to 0.311.
