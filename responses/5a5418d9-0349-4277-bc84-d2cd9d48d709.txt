Okay, so I've got this biology question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about an animal with a haploid number of 10. We're asked about the number of chromosomes in four different stages: a) spermatogonium, b) first polar body, c) second polar body, and d) secondary oocyte. And the animal is diploid, which I think means it has two sets of chromosomes normally.

Wait, the haploid number is 10, so the diploid number must be 20 because diploid is 2n, and haploid is n. So the diploid cells have 20 chromosomes, and haploid cells have 10.

Now, let's go through each part.

a) Spermatogonium: Spermatogonia are the male germ cells that undergo mitosis to produce more spermatogonia or go through meiosis to form spermatocytes. So, when a spermatogonium is in the initial stage, it's a diploid cell. So it should have 20 chromosomes. But wait, waitâ€”when a cell is in the process of division, like during mitosis or meiosis, its chromosomes are condensed and visible. But the question is about the number of chromosomes, not chromatids. So, each chromosome has two chromatids during S phase, but the count of chromosomes remains the same. So the number of chromosomes in a diploid cell is 20, each with two chromatids during S phase, but the total count is still 20 chromosomes. So for a), I think it's 20 chromosomes.

Wait, but wait! Spermatogonium is a type of stem cell that undergoes mitosis, so each cell is diploid. So the number of chromosomes would be 20. So a) is 20 chromosomes.

b) First polar body: Polar bodies are formed during oogenesis. The first polar body is a small cell that results from the meiosis I division. The primary oocyte undergoes meiosis I, which is a reductional division, so the first polar body ends up with haploid chromosomes. But wait, after meiosis I, the primary oocyte would have 10 chromosomes (haploid), and the first polar body also has 10 chromosomes because it's a product of the same division. But wait, when the primary oocyte undergoes meiosis I, the first polar body is formed. So in this case, the first polar body has 10 chromosomes, each of which is a single chromatid because the S phase has already occurred. Wait, but during meiosis I, after the division, the cells have 10 chromosomes each, right? So the first polar body would have 10 chromosomes, each with two chromatids (since S phase has been completed before meiosis I). Wait, no. Wait, during meiosis I, the homologous chromosomes are separated, so each cell gets half. But when the first polar body is formed, it's a cell that has the same number of chromosomes as the secondary oocyte, but probably the same number of chromatids. Wait, maybe during meiosis I, the cells are in a state where each chromosome has two chromatids. So the first polar body would have 10 chromosomes, each with two chromatids. So the number of chromosomes is 10, each with two chromatids, but the question is about the number of chromosomes. So the count is 10 chromosomes. But wait, in the options, sometimes they refer to chromatids as separate. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should clarify. The number of chromosomes refers to the count, regardless of chromatids. So each diploid cell has 20 chromosomes. After meiosis I, each cell has 10 chromosomes. So the first polar body would have 10 chromosomes. So option b) is 10 chromosomes.

c) Second polar body: The second polar body is formed during meiosis II. The secondary oocyte undergoes meiosis II, which is similar to mitosis. The second polar body is the sister chromatid that's expelled. So after meiosis II, the secondary oocyte would have 10 chromosomes (but actually, in reality, the secondary oocyte ends up with 10, and the second polar body also has 10, but wait, that depends on the specifics. Alternatively, when meiosis II is completed, each of the two cells (the oocyte and the second polar body) have 10 chromosomes each. So the second polar body would have 10 chromosomes. But wait, during meiosis II, the sister chromatids are separated, so each cell gets half. Wait, no: the secondary oocyte (from meiosis I) has 10 chromosomes, each with two chromatids. When meiosis II happens, it splits into two cells. So the second polar body would have 10 chromosomes (each with one chromatid, because after division, each chromatid becomes a separate chromosome). Wait, no. Let me think again.

In meiosis I, the primary oocyte divides into a secondary oocyte and the first polar body, each with 10 chromosomes, each having two chromatids. Then, during meiosis II, the secondary oocyte divides into two cells: one is the mature oocyte, and the other is the second polar body. Each of these two cells would have 10 chromosomes, each consisting of a single chromatid (since the sister chromatids have separated). So the second polar body has 10 chromosomes, each of which is a single chromatid. But the question is about the number of chromosomes, not chromatids. So the count is 10 chromosomes.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the second polar body has 20 chromatids, which would be 10 chromosomes each with two chromatids. No, that can't be because after meiosis II, each chromosome should have only one chromatid. Wait, no, during meiosis II, the sister chromatids are separated, so each cell gets one chromatid per chromosome. So in the second polar body, it's 10 chromosomes, each with one chromatid. So the number of chromosomes is 10. But looking at the options, some options mention 20 chromatids. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the stages. Let me try again.

In the primary oocyte (haploid 10, diploid 20), during meiosis I, it divides into a secondary oocyte (10, 2n?) Wait, no. Wait, the primary oocyte is diploid (2n=20). After meiosis I, the secondary oocyte is haploid (n=10), and the first polar body is also haploid (n=10). Now, during meiosis II, the secondary oocyte (which has 10 chromosomes, each with two chromatids) divides into two cells: one is the mature oocyte (10, each with one chromatid) and the second polar body (10, each with one chromatid). So the second polar body has 10 chromosomes, each with one chromatid. So the number of chromosomes is 10.

Wait, but the options seem to have different numbers. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, for example, option C says a) 20 chromosomes, b) 10 chromosomes, c)20 chromatids, d)10 chromatids. So for part c), 20 chromatids. But that would mean 10 chromosomes, each with two chromatids, which would be the case before meiosis II. Hmm. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused about when the polar bodies are formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the second polar body is formed during meiosis II, and at that point, the number of chromosomes is 10, each with one chromatid, so the count is 10 chromosomes. But maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about each cell type.

a) Spermatogonium: This is a diploid cell (since it's a germ cell that undergoes mitosis to produce more spermatogonia). So it has 20 chromosomes.

b) First polar body: This is formed during meiosis I of oogenesis. It's a haploid cell with 10 chromosomes. So each chromosome has two chromatids (since S phase is completed before meiosis I). So the first polar body has 10 chromosomes, each with two chromatids, making 20 chromatids. But the question is about the number of chromosomes, not chromatids. So the count is 10 chromosomes.

Wait, but some options might refer to the number of chromatids. Let me clarify: The question asks for the number of chromosomes, not chromatids. So for part b), it's 10 chromosomes.

c) Second polar body: Formed during meiosis II. The secondary oocyte (from meiosis I) has 10 chromosomes, each with two chromatids. During meiosis II, each chromatid becomes a separate chromosome. So the second polar body would have 10 chromosomes, each with one chromatid. So the count is 10 chromosomes. But wait, the option might refer to the number of chromatids. For example, if the second polar body has 10 chromosomes, each with one chromatid, then the total is 10 chromatids, but the question is about chromosomes, so 10.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about each option.

Looking at option B: a)10 chromosomes, which can't be right because a) is the spermatogonium, which is diploid, so 20 chromosomes. So option B is out.

Option C: a)20 chromosomes. That makes sense for a), so that's a possible option. Then b)10 chromosomes, which also makes sense. c)20 chromatids. So for part c), the second polar body has 20 chromatids, which would mean 10 chromosomes each with two chromatids. That would imply that the cell is in a state where the chromosomes have two chromatids, which would be the case before meiosis II. But the second polar body is formed after meiosis II, so each chromosome should have only one chromatid. So option C's part c) doesn't seem right.

Option F: a)10 chromosomes (wrong, a) should be 20), so F is out.

Option G: a)20 chromosomes (correct for a). b)10 chromatids. Hmm. So for part b), 10 chromatids. That would mean 5 chromosomes, each with two chromatids. Not matching, because the first polar body has 10 chromosomes. So option G is incorrect.

Option H: a)10 chromatids (wrong, a) should have 20 chromosomes), so H is out.

Option I: a)10 chromosomes (wrong), so I is out.

Option J: a)20 chromosomes (correct), b)20 chromatids. So for part b), 20 chromatids would mean 10 chromosomes, each with two chromatids. That matches the first polar body, which has 10 chromosomes, each with two chromatids. So part b) would be 10 chromosomes, 20 chromatids. So the count in part b) is 10 chromosomes. So option J for part b) says 20 chromatids. So if the question is about the number of chromosomes, part b) would have 10, but the option J for part b) says 20 chromatids, which is correct because it's the number of chromatids. Wait, but the question asks for the number of chromosomes, not chromatids. So part b) should be 10 chromosomes. So option J's part b) says 20 chromatids, which is correct for the number of chromatids, but the question is about chromosomes, so part b) should be 10, which matches option J's part b) as 20 chromatids. But the question is about the number of chromosomes, so J's part b) is 20 chromatids, which is not the same as the number of chromosomes. The question is about chromosomes, so part b) is 10 chromosomes, which would be a count of 10, so the answer would be 10 chromosomes, which is the case in option J's part b) being 20 chromatids, but the actual chromosome count is 10. So for part b), the answer is 10 chromosomes, which would correspond to option J's part b) being 20 chromatids, but that's not matching the question's part b) which asks for chromosomes.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to outline each part again clearly.

a) Spermatogonium: Diploid, so 20 chromosomes.

b) First polar body: After meiosis I, so 10 chromosomes (haploid), each with two chromatids. So number of chromosomes =10.

c) Second polar body: After meiosis II, so 10 chromosomes (each with one chromatid), so number of chromosomes=10.

d) Secondary oocyte: After meiosis I, it's in the process of meiosis II. So it has 10 chromosomes, each with two chromatids. So the number of chromosomes is 10, but each has two chromatids. So the count is 10 chromosomes.

Wait, but if the secondary oocyte is in the process of meiosis II, it's at the stage where it's about to divide. So at that point, each chromosome has two chromatids. So the number of chromosomes is 10, but the number of chromatids is 20.

Wait, but the question is asking for the number of chromosomes, not chromatids. So for each part:

a) 20 chromosomes.

b) 10 chromosomes.

c) 10 chromosomes.

d) 10 chromosomes.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have all four parts as 20,10,10,10. Let me check the options again.

Option B: a)10, b)10, c)10, d)10. But a) should be 20, so B is incorrect.

Option C: a)20, b)10, c)20, d)10. So c) is 20, which would be 10 chromosomes each with two chromatids. But for part c), the second polar body should have 10 chromosomes, so 10.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the stages. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: Let's go through each part step by step.

a) Spermatogonium: It's a diploid cell, so 20 chromosomes.

b) First polar body: It's formed during meiosis I, so it's haploid, 10 chromosomes.

c) Second polar body: Formed during meiosis II, so 10 chromosomes.

d) Secondary oocyte: After meiosis I, it's in the stage before meiosis II. So it has 10 chromosomes, each with two chromatids. So the number of chromosomes is 10.

Now, looking at the options, let's see which one matches.

Option C: a)20, b)10, c)20, d)10. So c) would be 20, which would be 10 chromosomes each with two chromatids. But the question is about the number of chromosomes, so c) should be 10. So option C is incorrect.

Option J: a)20, b)20 chromatids, c)10, d)20. So part b) is 20 chromatids, which is 10 chromosomes. So the number of chromosomes is 10, which is correct. Part c) is 10, which is correct. Part d) is 20, which would imply 10 chromosomes each with two chromatids. Wait, but the secondary oocyte has 10 chromosomes. So option J's part d) is 20, which would be 10 chromosomes with two chromatids each. But the question is about the number of chromosomes, so d) should be 10, but option J says 20. So that's incorrect.

Option F: a)10, which is wrong.

Option G: a)20, b)10, c)20, d)10. So part c) is 20, which would be 10 chromosomes each with two chromatids. But the second polar body should have 10 chromosomes, so c) should be 10. So option G is incorrect.

Option B: a)10, which is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think about the stages again.

Wait, in meiosis I, the primary oocyte (2n=20) divides into a secondary oocyte (n=10) and the first polar body (n=10). So the first polar body has 10 chromosomes, each with two chromatids (because S phase has occurred). So the number of chromosomes is 10.

In meiosis II, the secondary oocyte (n=10, each with two chromatids) divides into an oocyte (n=10, each with one chromatid) and the second polar body (n=10, each with one chromatid). So the second polar body has 10 chromosomes.

So, for part c), the second polar body has 10 chromosomes.

d) Secondary oocyte: After meiosis I, it's in the stage where it's about to undergo meiosis II. So it has 10 chromosomes, each with two chromatids. So the count is 10 chromosomes.

Looking at the options, which option has a)20, b)10, c)10, d)10.

Looking at the options, none of the options perfectly match this. Wait, let me check again.

Option I: a)10, b)10, c)20, d)20. No.

Option H: a)10, b)20, c)10, d)20. No.

Option J: a)20, b)20, c)10, d)20. Part b) is 20, which is 10 chromosomes, so correct for part b). Part c) is 10, correct. Part d) is 20, which would imply 10 chromosomes, each with two chromatids, which is the case for the secondary oocyte. So d) would have 10 chromosomes, but the option says 20, which would be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

The secondary oocyte after meiosis I has 10 chromosomes, each with two chromatids. So the number of chromosomes is 10. So in part d), the answer is 10 chromosomes.

Looking at the options, which option has a)20, b)10, c)10, d)10.

Option C: a)20, b)10, c)20, d)10. So c) is 20, which is wrong.

Option J: a)20, b)20, c)10, d)20. So part d) is 20, which is wrong.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about each part again.

Wait, another approach: Each option lists four parts. Let me go through each option.

Looking at option B: a)10, which is wrong. So B is out.

Option C: a)20, correct. b)10, correct. c)20, which would be 10 chromosomes each with two chromatids. But the second polar body has 10 chromosomes, each with one chromatid. So c) should be 10, so option C is incorrect.

Option F: a)10, incorrect.

Option G: a)20, correct. b)10, correct. c)20, which is incorrect. So G is out.

Option J: a)20, correct. b)20, which would be 10 chromosomes each with two chromatids. So the first polar body has 10 chromosomes, so b) should be 10. So J is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think about the first polar body.

The first polar body is formed after meiosis I. Since meiosis I is a reduction division, the first polar body has 10 chromosomes, each with two chromatids (because S phase occurs before meiosis I). So the number of chromosomes is 10.

So for part b), the first polar body has 10 chromosomes. So looking for an option where part b) is 10.

Looking at option C: b)10, correct. c)20, which is incorrect.

Option J: b)20, incorrect.

Option B: b)10, but a) is 10, which is incorrect.

Option H: a)10, incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in considering the second polar body. Let me think again.

The second polar body is formed during meiosis II. It's a small cell that is essentially discarded. During meiosis II, the secondary oocyte (which has 10 chromosomes, each with two chromatids) divides into two cells. One is the mature oocyte (10, each with one chromatid) and the second polar body (10, each with one chromatid). So the second polar body has 10 chromosomes, each with one chromatid. So the count is 10.

Now, looking at option C: part c) is 20 chromatids, which would mean 10 chromosomes each with two. That would be the case before meiosis II, but after the division, each has one. So option C is incorrect.

Option J: part c) is 10, which is correct for the number of chromosomes. Part d) is 20, which would be 10 chromosomes each with two. But the secondary oocyte after meiosis I has 10 chromosomes each with two. So part d) should be 10 chromosomes, each with two, but the question is about the number of chromosomes, which is 10. So option J's part d) is 20, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look for an option where:

a) 20 chromosomes,

b)10 chromosomes,

c)10 chromosomes,

d)10 chromosomes.

Looking at the options:

Option C: a)20, b)10, c)20, d)10.

No, c) is 20.

Option J: a)20, b)20, c)10, d)20.

No, b) and d) are wrong.

Option B: a)10, wrong.

Option I: a)10, wrong.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in part d). The secondary oocyte is in the stage where it's about to undergo meiosis II. So it has 10 chromosomes, each with two chromatids. So the number of chromosomes is 10. But the option might be referring to the number of chromatids as 20.

Wait, the question is about the number of chromosomes, not chromatids. So d) should be 10 chromosomes.

Looking back to the options, option B: a)10, which is wrong.

Option C: d)10, which is correct.

Wait, option C has:

a)20 chromosomes,

b)10 chromosomes,

c)20 chromatids,

d)10 chromatids.

So, for part d), option C says 10 chromatids, which would imply 5 chromosomes, each with two. That's incorrect because the secondary oocyte has 10 chromosomes, each with two chromatids, so 20 chromatids. So the number of chromosomes is 10.

Wait, but the question is about the number of chromosomes, not chromatids. So part d) should be 10 chromosomes, each with two chromatids. So the count is 10 chromosomes.

Looking at the options, option C has d)10 chromatids, which is wrong. So perhaps the correct option is not present, but I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each part again.

a) Spermatogonium: 20 chromosomes.

b) First polar body: 10 chromosomes.

c) Second polar body: 10 chromosomes.

d) Secondary oocyte: 10 chromosomes.

So looking for an option where a)20, b)10, c)10, d)10.

Looking at the options, none of them have this combination. So perhaps I made a mistake in part c).

Wait, perhaps the second polar body has 20 chromatids, which would be 10 chromosomes each with two. But that would be before the division, not after. So after division, each has one chromatid. So the second polar body has 10 chromosomes, each with one chromatid. So the count is 10 chromosomes.

Wait, perhaps the options are considering the number of chromatids, not chromosomes. Let me read the question again.

The question asks, "how many chromosomes are present in..." So it's about the number of chromosomes, not chromatids.

Thus, the correct answers are:

a) 20

b) 10

c) 10

d) 10

Looking for an option that matches this. Let's check all options:

Option C: a)20, b)10, c)20, d)10. So c) is 20, which is wrong.

Option J: a)20, b)20, c)10, d)20. So b) and d) are wrong.

Option B: a)10, wrong.

Option I: a)10, wrong.

Option G: a)20, b)10, c)20, d)10. So c) is 20, wrong.

Option H: a)10, wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look at option B again.

Option B: a)10, b)10, c)10, d)10.

But a) should be 20, so B is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in part d). The secondary oocyte, after meiosis I, is in the stage called metaphase II, where it's about to split. So it has 10 chromosomes, each with two chromatids. So the number of chromosomes is 10, but the number of chromatids is 20. So the question is about chromosomes, so d) is 10.

Looking for an option where a)20, b)10, c)10, d)10.

None of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in part c).

Wait, perhaps the second polar body has 20 chromosomes. No, that can't be. Because during meiosis II, it's a division of the sister chromatids, so each cell gets half. So the second polar body has 10 chromosomes.

Wait, maybe the second polar body has 20 chromatids because it's still in the same cell as the oocyte before division. No, the second polar body is formed after the division, so each has 10 chromosomes.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about each option again.

Option C: a)20, b)10, c)20, d)10.

So part c) is 20, which would be 10 chromosomes each with two chromatids. But the second polar body has 10 chromosomes, each with one. So c) should be 10, so option C is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the first polar body has 20 chromosomes. No, that's wrong. It's haploid, so 10.

I'm really stuck. Let me try to see which option fits best.

Looking at option C, it's a)20, b)10, c)20, d)10.

So:

a)20 (correct),

b)10 (correct),

c)20 (incorrect, should be 10),

d)10 (correct).

So three out of four correct, but c) is wrong.

Option J: a)20, b)20, c)10, d)20.

a) correct,

b) incorrect (should be 10),

c) correct,

d) incorrect (should be 10).

So only two correct.

Option B: all 10s except a) is wrong.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the second polar body has 20 chromosomes because it's diploid again. No, that can't be. Polar bodies are haploid.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering that the second polar body has the same number as the oocyte. Let me think again.

During meiosis II, the secondary oocyte (10, each with two chromatids) divides into two cells: one oocyte (10, each with one) and one second polar body (10, each with one). So both have 10 chromosomes.

So, the second polar body has 10 chromosomes, each with one chromatid. So for part c), it's 10 chromosomes.

Looking at the options, the only option that has a)20, b)10, c)10, d)10 is not present. So perhaps I made a mistake in part d).

Wait, the secondary oocyte is in the stage after meiosis I but before meiosis II. So it has 10 chromosomes, each with two chromatids. So the number of chromosomes is 10.

So, looking for an option where a)20, b)10, c)10, d)10.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I've made an error in my understanding.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the number of chromosomes in each cell type.

Spermatogonium: 20 (diploid).

First polar body: 10 (haploid).

Second polar body: 10 (haploid).

Secondary oocyte: 10 (haploid, but each chromosome has two chromatids).

So, the number of chromosomes in each part:

a)20,

b)10,

c)10,

d)10.

Looking for an option where:

a) is 20,

b) is 10,

c) is 10,

d) is 10.

Looking at the options, none of them have this combination. So perhaps I'm missing something in the question.

Wait, the question says "the animal is diploid." So the haploid number is 10, diploid is 20.

In that case, the options might be considering the number of chromatids for some parts.

Wait, let me check each option again.

Option C: a)20 (correct), b)10 (correct), c)20 (incorrect), d)10 (correct).

So only c) is wrong.

Option J: a)20, b)20, c)10, d)20.

So parts b and d are wrong.

Option B: a)10, wrong.

Option I: a)10, wrong.

Option G: a)20, b)10, c)20, d)10.

a) correct, b) correct, c) incorrect, d) correct.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option C, even though c) is 20, which I think is wrong. But maybe I'm missing something about when the second polar body is formed.

Wait, perhaps the second polar body has 20 chromatids, which would be 10 chromosomes. So the count is 10 chromosomes but 20 chromatids.

But the question is about the number of chromosomes, so it's 10.

So, the only option where a) is 20, b) is 10, c) is 10, d) is 10 is not present. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: The second polar body might have 20 chromosomes because it's diploid. But that can't be right because polar bodies are haploid.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for the option where a) is 20, b) is 10, c) is 10, d) is 10. But none of the options have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the second polar body has 20 chromosomes because it's a product of meiosis II, which is a reduction division, but that can't be right because meiosis II doesn't reduce the chromosome number.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the cells as having 2n=20, n=10.

Spermatogonium: 2n=20.

First polar body: n=10.

Second polar body: n=10.

Secondary oocyte: n=10.

So, the number of chromosomes is 20,10,10,10.

Looking for an option that matches this.

Looking at option C: a)20, b)10, c)20, d)10.

Only c) is wrong.

Option J: a)20, b)20, c)10, d)20.

No.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is option C, even though c) is 20, which I think is incorrect. Or perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the second polar body has 20 chromosomes because it's a diploid cell. No, that can't be. Polar bodies are haploid.

Alternatively, perhaps the second polar body has 20 chromatids, which would be 10 chromosomes, each with two. So the count would be 10 chromosomes, but 20 chromatids. So part c) would have 10 chromosomes, but the option might be referring to the number of chromatids as 20.

But the question is about the number of chromosomes, so it's 10.

I think I've spent enough time on this. Based on my analysis, the correct answer should be:

a)20,

b)10,

c)10,

d)10.

But since none of the options match exactly, perhaps the intended answer is option C, which has a)20, b)10, c)20, d)10. But I'm not confident.

The question involves determining the number of chromosomes in four stages of meiosis for an animal with a haploid number of 10 (diploid number = 20). Here's the analysis:

1. **Spermatogonium (a):** Spermatogonia are diploid cells, so they contain 20 chromosomes.

2. **First Polar Body (b):** The first polar body is formed during meiosis I and is haploid, containing 10 chromosomes.

3. **Second Polar Body (c):** The second polar body is formed during meiosis II and is also haploid, containing 10 chromosomes.

4. **Secondary Oocyte (d):** The secondary oocyte, after meiosis I, is haploid and contains 10 chromosomes, each with two chromatids.

After evaluating the options, none perfectly match the expected answers. However, **Option C** aligns most closely with the correct answers for parts (a), (b), and (d), though part (c) is incorrect. 

ANSWER: C
