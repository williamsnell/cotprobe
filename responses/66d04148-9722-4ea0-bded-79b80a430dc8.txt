Question:

Discuss Mead's (1935) study of three New Guinea tribes. What do her findings indicate about the effect of culture on personality?

Options:

A: Culture has no effect on personality traits.
B: Personality traits, especially those related to dominance, vary depending on the culture.
C: The differences in personality traits among the tribes were insignificant.
D: Only one of the tribes showed variation in personality traits due to cultural influences.
E: Personality traits are universally consistent due to shared human experience.
F: The study concluded that environment has a stronger effect on personality than culture does.
G: Personality traits are determined by genetics.
H: The study indicated that cultural norms have no distinct patterns or effects on the personality traits of the tribes.
I: Personality traits are the same across all cultures.
J: Mead's findings suggest that personality traits are primarily influenced by biological factors, with little cultural impact.

Okay, so I have this question about Mead's study of three New Guinea tribes. I remember Mead did some work on how culture affects personality, but I'm not exactly sure about the details. Let me think.

The question is asking what Mead's findings indicate about the effect of culture on personality. The options are A through J. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Mead studied three tribes: the Arapesh, the Mundugumor, and the Tchambuli. From what I recall, she found that personality traits vary across cultures. Each tribe had different social structures and cultural norms, which influenced their behavior and personalities. For example, one tribe might emphasize cooperation while another focuses on dominance. 

Looking at the options, option B says personality traits, especially dominance, vary with culture. That sounds familiar. Mead's work showed that cultural factors shape personality, not just genetics. So B seems right.

Option A says no effect, which can't be right because her study was about how culture affects personality. Option C says differences were insignificant; that's not what I remember. Option D mentions only one tribe, but she studied three, so probably not. Option E talks about universal traits, which is more like the nature side, but Mead was into nurture. Option F says environment over culture; not sure, but I think she focused on culture. Option G is about genetics, which is opposite. H says cultural norms have no effect, which is wrong. I says traits are same across cultures, which is not what Mead found. J says mostly biological, which again contradicts her cultural perspective.

So, B is the correct answer because Mead's study showed that personality traits, especially dominance, vary with culture.

Mead's study of three New Guinea tribes demonstrated that cultural factors significantly influence personality traits, particularly those related to dominance. Each tribe exhibited distinct personality characteristics shaped by their unique cultural norms. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B
