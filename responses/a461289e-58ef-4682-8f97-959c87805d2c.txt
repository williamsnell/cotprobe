Okay, so I need to figure out how many different ice cream cones I can make given the conditions. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, the problem states that each cone can contain two ice cream balls. I have 6 flavors of ice cream and 5 types of cones. I need to find the total number of different ice cream cones possible.

Hmm, wait, so each cone has two ice cream balls. Does that mean two scoops? So, each cone will have two flavors, possibly the same or different, and the cone itself has 5 types.

I think the key here is to consider both the cone type and the combination of ice cream flavors. So the total number of different cones would be the number of ways to choose the cone multiplied by the number of ways to choose the ice cream flavors for that cone.

Let me think about the ice cream part first. Since each cone has two ice cream balls, I need to figure out how many ways I can choose two flavors from six. But wait, can the two balls be the same flavor or must they be different? The problem doesn't specify, so I think it's safe to assume they can be the same. That would mean it's a combination with repetition allowed.

The formula for combinations with repetition is C(n + r - 1, r), where n is the number of types and r is the number to choose. Here, n=6 flavors and r=2 balls. So that would be C(6+2-1, 2) = C(7,2). Calculating that, 7 choose 2 is (7*6)/(2*1) = 21. So there are 21 possible ways to choose the two ice cream balls.

Alternatively, if the two ice cream balls had to be different flavors, it would be a permutation without repetition. So that would be 6P2 = 6*5=30. But I think the problem allows for the same flavor, so I'll go with 21.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Another way to look at it is: for each ice cream ball, how many choices do I have? The first ball can be any of the 6 flavors, and the second ball can also be any of the 6. So that's 6 * 6 = 36. But wait, that's when order matters because choosing flavor A then B is different from B then A. But in a cone, the order might not matter; the two balls are just on top of each other, so AB is the same as BA. So that would mean that if I consider AB and BA as the same, I should use combinations, which would be 6*6 / 2 = 18. Wait, but 6*6 is 36, divided by 2 is 18. But earlier I thought it was 21. Hmm, where did I go wrong?

Oh wait, no, wait. The formula for combinations with repetition is when you can choose the same item multiple times, so for two identical items, the number is C(n + r -1, r). So for n=6, r=2, it's C(7,2)=21. So that's correct. The 21 includes cases where both balls are the same flavor, like AA, BB, etc. So the number of possible ice cream combinations is 21.

Alternatively, if the order doesn't matter and repetitions are allowed, the number of possible pairs is 21. So the ice cream part has 21 possibilities.

Now, the cone part: there are 5 types of cones. So for each ice cream combination, there are 5 possible cones.

So the total number of different ice cream cones is the number of ice cream combinations multiplied by the number of cone types. That would be 21 * 5 = 105. Wait, but that's not one of the options. The options are 120, 150, etc. Hmm, did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Perhaps the two ice cream balls are considered as a stack, but the order might matter. So maybe for each cone, the two ice creams are stacked, so the order does matter. Let me think again.

If order matters, then the number of ice cream combinations would be permutations with repetition. So that's 6 choices for the first ball and 6 for the second, giving 6*6 = 36. So if order matters, it's 36. Then, multiplied by 5 cones, that's 36*5=180. Let me check the options: option I is 180. But does order matter in this context?

Wait, the problem says "how many different ice cream cones can you make." So the cone is a single entity, with two balls. So whether the two balls are vanilla on top and chocolate below, or vice versa, would that count as a different cone? I think it would, because the arrangement is different. So order does matter.

Wait, but in the earlier approach, when I thought of combinations, I was assuming order doesn't matter. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider permutations, not combinations, because each arrangement is unique.

So if order matters, the number of ice cream combinations is 6*6=36. Then multiply by 5 cones, giving 36*5=180. So the answer would be 180, which is option I.

But wait, another angle: perhaps the two balls are considered as a single entity, but the same cone. So maybe the order doesn't matter because it's just two balls on a cone. But I think in reality, stacking order might matter because chocolate on top and vanilla below is a different cone than vanilla on top and chocolate below. So, in that case, order matters.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the two balls as a single choice, regardless of order. Let me check the problem statement again: "each cone can contain two ice cream balls." It doesn't specify that order matters, but typically, in such problems, when you choose two items where order doesn't matter, you use combinations, but when it's a sequence, you use permutations.

So perhaps the problem is treating the two balls as a single selection, regardless of order. So, for example, choosing vanilla and chocolate is the same as choosing chocolate and vanilla. In that case, the number of combinations would be C(6+2-1,2)=21 as before. Then multiply by 5 cones, giving 105. But 105 isn't one of the options either.

Wait, the options given are: A:120, B:150, C:60, D:210, E:360, F:300, G:72, H:240, I:180, J:90.

Hmm, 180 is an option, so perhaps the correct approach is considering permutations. So 6 flavors for the first ball and 6 for the second, giving 36, times 5 cones is 180. That would make sense.

Wait, but wait another thought: perhaps the two balls can be the same or different, and order matters. So 6 options for the first, 6 for the second, giving 36. Then 5 cones, 36*5=180. So option I is 180.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that each cone can have two balls, but the selection is without order, so it's combinations with repetition allowed. So 21, times 5 is 105. But since 105 isn't an option, perhaps the problem expects order to matter.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the two balls can be the same or different, and the order doesn't matter. So combinations with repetition: 21, times 5 cones: 105. But 105 isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem allows for each cone to have two balls, but for each position (top and bottom), you can choose independently. So the number of ways to choose the two balls is 6*6=36, and then multiplied by 5 cones gives 180. So that would be option I.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each cone is a separate entity, so the choice of cone is independent, and for each cone, you can choose any two flavors, considering order, so 6*6=36, times 5 cones: 180.

So looking at the options, 180 is option I. So I think the correct answer is I: 180.

The problem involves determining the number of different ice cream cones that can be made with 6 flavors and 5 cone types, where each cone holds two ice cream balls. Since the order of the two balls matters (e.g., vanilla on top and chocolate below is different from the reverse), the number of possible combinations for the ice cream is calculated as permutations with repetition: 6 choices for the first ball and 6 for the second, resulting in 6 * 6 = 36. Multiplying this by the 5 cone types gives 36 * 5 = 180. 

Thus, the correct answer is:

I: 180
