Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here asking which of the options is not a TV cartoon duo. The options are labeled A through H. Let me go through each one to figure out which one doesn't fit.

Starting with option A: SpongeBob and Patrick. I know they're from "SpongeBob SquarePants," which is definitely a popular animated TV show. So they are a duo, so A is a TV cartoon duo.

Option B: Phineas and Ferb. They're the main characters from "Phineas and Ferb," another well-known animated series. So B is definitely a TV duo.

C: Tom and Jerry. This is a classic cartoon duo, right? They've been around for a long time, so C is a TV duo.

D: Chip and Dale. I remember these two chipmunks from various Disney cartoons. They're definitely a duo, so D is a TV duo.

E: Beavis and Butt-head. They're from the show "Beavis and Butt-head," which is an animated series. So E is a TV duo.

F: Pinky and the Brain. They're the main characters from "Pinky and the Brain," an animated show. So F is a TV duo.

G: Scooby and Shaggy. They are from "Scooby-Doo," which is a long-running animated series. G is a TV duo.

H: Simon and Garfunkel. Wait, I'm trying to recall. Simon and Garfunkel are actually a famous music duo, right? They're a folk-rock duo known for their music, not for being characters in a TV cartoon. So H is not a TV cartoon duo; they're real people.

So the answer should be H.

The answer is H.
