<think>
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says: We have 0.01 moles of AgCl. The K_eq for Ag(NH3)2 is 1.74 × 10^7, and the K_sp of AgCl is 2.8 × 10^-10. The question is, how much 1M ammonia solution is required to dissolve this AgCl? The options are from A to J, with various volumes in ml.

Hmm. I remember that AgCl is a sparingly soluble salt, and when it dissolves in ammonia, it forms the diamminesilver(I) complex, Ag(NH3)2+. The reaction involved is something like AgCl(s) + 2NH3(aq) ⇌ Ag(NH3)2(aq) + Cl^-(aq). So the ammonia acts as a ligand, increasing the solubility of AgCl by forming a complex ion.

I think the approach here is to first find out how much NH3 is needed to dissolve the given moles of AgCl. Since Keq is given for the complex formation, I might need to use that to find the concentration of NH3 required.

Wait, but K_sp for AgCl is given as 2.8e-10, which is its solubility product. When ammonia is added, it shifts the solubility equilibrium because Cl^- is a spectator ion, but the Ag+ ions form the complex with NH3, effectively removing Ag+ from solution and allowing more AgCl to dissolve.

Let me think about the steps. First, I'll probably write the dissolution of AgCl and the formation of the complex.

The dissolution of AgCl is: AgCl(s) ⇌ Ag+ + Cl^-; K_sp = [Ag+][Cl^-] = 2.8e-10.

When NH3 is added, it reacts with Ag+ to form Ag(NH3)2^+. The reaction is: Ag+ + 2NH3 ⇌ Ag(NH3)2^+; K_eq = 1.74e7. 

So combining these two reactions, the overall reaction when AgCl dissolves in NH3 is:
AgCl(s) + 2NH3 ⇌ Ag(NH3)2^+ + Cl^-; K_total = K_sp * K_eq = (2.8e-10) * (1.74e7) ≈ 4.872e-3.

Wait, that makes sense because the overall K is the product of the two individual Ks. So K_total is 2.8e-10 * 1.74e7 ≈ (2.8 * 1.74) * 1e-3 ≈ 4.872e-3. 

Now, using this K_total, I can find the concentration of NH3 needed. The reaction is:

AgCl(s) + 2NH3 ⇌ Ag(NH3)2^+ + Cl^-

Let’s let the solubility (moles per liter) of AgCl that dissolve be 's'. Then, the concentrations at equilibrium would be:

[Ag(NH3)2^+] = s
[Cl^-] = s
[NH3] = 2s (since 2 moles of NH3 are consumed per mole of AgCl dissolved)

But wait, wait. Actually, when AgCl dissolves, each mole of AgCl produces one mole of Ag(NH3)2+ and one mole of Cl^-. So for each mole of AgCl that dissolves, 2 moles of NH3 are consumed. So if 's' is the moles of AgCl dissolved per liter, then [NH3] = initial [NH3] - 2s. But since the initial concentration is 1M, and s is small (because K_total is small), maybe we can approximate [NH3] ≈ 1 - 2s ≈ 1, but I'm not sure if that's valid here.

Wait, let me think again. The K_total expression is:

K_total = [Ag(NH3)2+][Cl^-] / [NH3]^2 = s * s / (2s)^2. Wait, no, wait. Because [NH3] = 2s? Or is it [NH3] = initial - 2s?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write the expression correctly. Let me set it up.

Let s be the moles of AgCl dissolved per liter. Then:

[Ag(NH3)2+] = s
[Cl^-] = s
[NH3] = 1 - 2s (since 2s moles of NH3 are consumed per liter)

So the K_total expression is:

K_total = (s)(s) / (1 - 2s)^2 = s² / (1 - 2s)^2.

We know K_total is approximately 4.872e-3.

So s² / (1 - 2s)^2 = 4.872e-3.

Taking square roots on both sides:

s / (1 - 2s) = sqrt(4.872e-3) ≈ 0.0698.

So s ≈ 0.0698*(1 - 2s).

Expanding that:

s ≈ 0.0698 - 0.1396s.

Bring terms together:

s + 0.1396s ≈ 0.0698
1.1396s ≈ 0.0698
s ≈ 0.0698 / 1.1396 ≈ 0.0612 M.

So s ≈ 0.0612 moles per liter.

Wait, but we have 0.01 moles of AgCl. To find the volume of solution, moles = concentration * volume, so volume = moles / concentration.

So volume = 0.01 mol / 0.0612 mol/L ≈ 0.1634 L ≈ 163.4 ml.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 163 ml. The closest options are F: 154 ml and J:128 ml. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should not have approximated [NH3] as 1. Let me try without that approximation.

The K_total expression is s² / (1 - 2s)^2 = 4.872e-3.

Let me take the square root:

s / (1 - 2s) = sqrt(4.872e-3) ≈ 0.0698.

So s = 0.0698*(1 - 2s).

Expanding:

s = 0.0698 - 0.1396s.

Bring terms together:

s + 0.1396s = 0.0698 → 1.1396s = 0.0698 → s ≈ 0.0612 M.

Wait, same result. So the volume needed is 0.01 / 0.0612 ≈ 0.1634 L → 163.4 ml. But none of the options are exactly that. The options are F:154, J:128, etc.

Hmm. Maybe I made a miscalculation in K_total. Let me check that again.

K_total is K_sp * K_eq. K_sp is 2.8e-10, K_eq is 1.74e7. So 2.8e-10 * 1.74e7 = (2.8 * 1.74) * 1e-3. 2.8 * 1.74 is about 4.872, so 4.872e-3, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution may not be dilute. Let me try without approximating [NH3] as 1. So let's set up the equation without approximation.

s² / (1 - 2s)^2 = 4.872e-3.

Take square roots:

s/(1-2s) = sqrt(4.872e-3) ≈ 0.0698.

So s = 0.0698*(1 - 2s).

Expanding:

s = 0.0698 - 0.1396 s.

Bring terms together:

s + 0.1396 s = 0.0698 → 1.1396 s = 0.0698 → s = 0.0698 / 1.1396 ≈ 0.0612 M.

Same result. So the volume would be 0.01 / 0.0612 ≈ 0.1634 L → 163.4 ml. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I need to check my approach again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me think again: Each mole of AgCl produces one mole of Ag(NH3)2+ and one mole of Cl^-, and consumes two moles of NH3. So yes, [NH3] = 1 - 2s.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that the ammonia concentration is in excess, so that 2s << 1, and thus [NH3] ≈ 1. Then, K_total ≈ s² / 1² → s = sqrt(K_total) ≈ sqrt(4.872e-3) ≈ 0.0698 M.

Wait, wait! Oh no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because if K_total = s² / (1 - 2s)^2, and if 2s is much less than 1, then (1 - 2s) ≈ 1, so K_total ≈ s² → s ≈ sqrt(K_total) ≈ 0.0698 M.

Wait, but earlier I had s ≈ 0.0612 M. Hmm, but that was after considering 2s. So perhaps I should just approximate s as sqrt(K_total) ≈ 0.0698 M, and then see what that gives for the volume.

Wait, but wait, if I use s ≈ 0.0698 M, then the moles of AgCl required would be s * V. Since we have 0.01 moles, V = 0.01 / 0.0698 ≈ 0.1432 L → 143.2 ml. Hmm, that's closer to option E:75 ml? No, wait, option F is 154, which is close to 143.2. But wait, maybe I need to be more precise.

Wait, perhaps I should not make the approximation but instead solve the equation without it.

Let me set it up again:

s² / (1 - 2s)^2 = 4.872e-3 → Let me write this as (s/(1-2s))^2 = 4.872e-3 → s/(1-2s) = sqrt(4.872e-3) ≈ 0.0698.

So, s = 0.0698 * (1 - 2s).

So, s = 0.0698 - 0.1396 s → s + 0.1396 s = 0.0698 → s (1 + 0.1396) = 0.0698 → s = 0.0698 / 1.1396 ≈ 0.0612 M.

Then, volume = 0.01 / 0.0612 ≈ 0.1634 L → 163.4 ml, which is approximately 163 ml. But the options don't have this. The closest is F:154 ml and J:128 ml. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, maybe I should consider that when AgCl dissolves, the concentration of NH3 is the initial concentration minus 2s. But if the initial concentration is 1M, and s is 0.0612 M, then 2s is 0.1224, which is less than 1, so the approximation [NH3] ≈ 1 - 2s ≈ 0.8776 M. But in the K_total expression, it's (s^2) / ( (1 - 2s)^2 ). So perhaps I should not have taken the square root so quickly. Let me try solving the equation without approximations.

Let me write it as:

s² = K_total * (1 - 2s)^2.

Expanding the right side:

s² = K_total * (1 -4s +4s²).

Rearranging:

s² = K_total (1 -4s +4s²).

Bring all terms to one side:

s² - K_total (1 -4s +4s²) = 0.

Expanding:

s² - K_total + 4 K_total s -4 K_total s² = 0.

Combine like terms:

(1 -4 K_total) s² +4 K_total s - K_total = 0.

Now plug in K_total =4.872e-3.

So,

(1 -4*4.872e-3) s² +4*4.872e-3 s -4.872e-3 = 0.

Calculate coefficients:

4*4.872e-3 = 0.019488.

So,

(1 - 0.019488)s² + 0.019488 s - 0.004872 = 0 → 0.980512 s² + 0.019488 s - 0.004872 = 0.

This is a quadratic equation in s: a=0.980512, b=0.019488, c=-0.004872.

Using quadratic formula:

s = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)] / (2a).

Compute discriminant D = b² -4ac.

b² = (0.019488)^2 ≈ 0.0003798.

4ac =4 * 0.980512 * (-0.004872) ≈ 4 * (-0.004779) ≈ -0.019116.

So D = 0.0003798 - 4*(0.980512)*(-0.004872).

Wait, wait, no: D is b² -4ac. Since c is negative, 4ac is negative, so -4ac is positive.

Wait, let me compute:

4ac = 4 * 0.980512 * (-0.004872) = 4 * (-0.004779) ≈ -0.019116.

So D = b² -4ac = 0.0003798 - (-0.019116) → 0.0003798 + 0.019116 ≈ 0.0194958.

sqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(0.0194958) ≈ 0.1396.

So s = [-0.019488 ± 0.1396] / (2*0.980512).

We'll take the positive root:

s = ( -0.019488 + 0.1396 ) / 1.961024 ≈ (0.119112) / 1.961024 ≈ 0.0607 M.

So s ≈ 0.0607 M.

Then volume = 0.01 mol / 0.0607 M ≈ 0.1647 L → 164.7 ml. Still around 165 ml, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me double-check. The reaction is AgCl(s) + 2NH3 ⇌ Ag(NH3)2+ + Cl^-.

So the K_total is [Ag(NH3)2+][Cl^-] / [NH3]^2 = (s)(s) / (1 - 2s)^2 = s²/(1-2s)^2.

Yes, that's correct. So I think the calculation is right, but perhaps the options are approximate, or I made a miscalculation in the arithmetic.

Wait, let me recheck the K_total calculation. K_sp is 2.8e-10, K_eq is 1.74e7.

2.8e-10 * 1.74e7 = (2.8 *1.74) * 1e-3.

2.8 * 1.74: 2.8 *1.7=4.76, 2.8 *0.04=0.112 → total 4.872. So 4.872e-3.

Yes, that's correct. So K_total is indeed 4.872e-3.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer is around 164 ml, but the options don't have that. Let me check the options again: A:50, B:400, C:175, D:300, E:75, F:154, G:100, H:200, I:250, J:128.

Wait, option F is 154 ml, which is close to 164. Maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the concentration of NH3 is 1M, and find how much is needed. Let me think differently.

We have s = [Ag(NH3)2+] = [Cl^-] = s.

[NH3] = 1 - 2s.

Then K_total = s² / (1 - 2s)^2 = 4.872e-3.

Taking square root gives s/(1-2s) = 0.0698.

So s = 0.0698 (1 - 2s) → s = 0.0698 - 0.1396 s → 1.1396 s = 0.0698 → s ≈ 0.0612 M.

So volume = 0.01 / 0.0612 ≈ 0.1634 L → 163.4 ml.

Hmm. But the options don't have this. Wait, perhaps the problem expects a different approach, such as using the complex formation without considering the K_sp first.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the minimum concentration of NH3 needed to dissolve the AgCl, using the K_eq.

Wait, another approach: The solubility of AgCl in ammonia can be found using the formula:

s = sqrt( (K_sp * K_eq) ) / (1 + ... ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the equation considering the complex formation.

Wait, perhaps another way: The concentration of Ag+ in solution when AgCl dissolves in NH3 is determined by the K_eq. The reaction is Ag+ + 2NH3 ⇌ Ag(NH3)2+; K_eq = [Ag(NH3)2+]/([Ag+][NH3]^2) =1.74e7.

But since we want to dissolve AgCl, the [Ag+] must be low enough so that AgCl can dissolve. The K_sp of AgCl is [Ag+][Cl^-] =2.8e-10.

Assuming that [Cl^-] = s (the solubility), and [Ag+] is very low because it's tied up in the complex. So [Ag+] = (K_sp) / [Cl^-] = (2.8e-10)/s.

But from the complex formation, [Ag+] = [Ag(NH3)2+] / (K_eq * [NH3]^2).

Wait, no: K_eq = [Ag(NH3)2+]/([Ag+][NH3]^2) → [Ag+] = [Ag(NH3)2+]/(K_eq [NH3]^2).

But [Ag(NH3)2+] = s, and [NH3] = 1 - 2s ≈ 1 (if s is small).

So [Ag+] ≈ s / (K_eq * (1)^2) = s/(1.74e7).

But from K_sp, [Ag+] = 2.8e-10 / s.

So setting them equal: s/(1.74e7) = 2.8e-10 / s → s² = (2.8e-10)(1.74e7) → s² = 4.872e-3 → s = sqrt(4.872e-3) ≈ 0.0698 M.

So s ≈ 0.0698 M.

Then, the volume needed is 0.01 / 0.0698 ≈ 0.1432 L → 143.2 ml. Again, not matching the options.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider that the ammonia is in excess, so [NH3] ≈1. So the solubility s is approximately 0.0698 M. So volume is 0.01 / 0.0698 ≈143 ml. Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach was correct, but the options expect the answer to be approximated. Looking back, the options are F:154 ml and J:128 ml. Maybe I did a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the volume: 0.01 moles / 0.0612 M = 0.1634 L → 163.4 ml. But none of the options are that close.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the K_total calculation. Let me check that again.

K_total = K_sp * K_eq = (2.8e-10) * (1.74e7) = (2.8 * 1.74) * 1e-3. 2.8 *1.74 is indeed 4.872, so 4.872e-3.

Yes, that's correct. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but the closest option is F:154 ml. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry of the reaction.

Wait, another thought: The reaction is AgCl(s) + 2NH3 → Ag(NH3)2+ + Cl^-.

So for each mole of AgCl that dissolves, 2 moles of NH3 are consumed. So the total moles of NH3 needed would be 2 * moles of AgCl.

Moles of AgCl = 0.01, so moles of NH3 needed = 0.02. Since the concentration is 1M, the volume required is 0.02 / 1 = 0.02 L → 20 ml. But that's not one of the options either, and it's way off. So that can't be right.

Wait, that approach doesn't consider the K values, so it's not correct. The correct approach must involve the K_total.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the solubility of a sparingly soluble salt in a complexing agent.

The formula is s = sqrt( (K_sp * K_eq) ) / (1 + ... ), but I'm not recalling it exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the solubility s as:

s = K_sp * K_eq / (1 + 2*K_eq*s )^2.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option F:154 ml. Let me check: 154 ml is 0.154 L.

So s = 0.01 / 0.154 ≈0.0649 M.

Then, K_total = s² / (1 - 2s)^2.

Plugging s=0.0649:

(0.0649)^2 / (1 - 2*0.0649)^2 = (0.00421) / (0.8702)^2 ≈ 0.00421 / 0.7572 ≈ 0.00556.

But K_total is 4.872e-3, which is about 0.00487. So 0.00556 is a bit higher than K_total. That might suggest that s is a bit less than 0.0649 M, so the volume would be a bit more than 154 ml. So perhaps the correct answer is around 163 ml, but since it's not an option, maybe the intended answer is F:154 ml, considering some approximations.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup, and the correct answer is option F:154 ml.
</think>

To determine how much 1M ammonia solution is required to dissolve 0.01 moles of AgCl, we analyze the dissolution of AgCl in ammonia, forming the complex ion Ag(NH₃)₂⁺. The overall reaction is:

\[
\text{AgCl(s)} + 2\text{NH₃(aq)} \rightleftharpoons \text{Ag(NH₃)₂⁺(aq)} + \text{Cl⁻(aq)}
\]

### Key Steps:
1. **Solubility Product and Complex Formation Constants**:
   - \( K_{sp} \) of AgCl = \( 2.8 \times 10^{-10} \)
   - \( K_{eq} \) for Ag(NH₃)₂⁺ = \( 1.74 \times 10^7 \)
   - \( K_{total} = K_{sp} \times K_{eq} = (2.8 \times 10^{-10})(1.74 \times 10^7) = 4.872 \times 10^{-3} \)

2. **Equilibrium Expression**:
   Let the solubility of AgCl be \( s \) (moles per liter). At equilibrium:
   - \([Ag(NH₃)₂⁺] = s\)
   - \([Cl⁻] = s\)
   - \([NH₃] = 1 - 2s\) (since 2 moles of NH₃ are consumed per mole of AgCl dissolved).

   The equilibrium expression is:
   \[
   K_{total} = \frac{[Ag(NH₃)₂⁺][Cl⁻]}{[NH₃]^2} = \frac{s^2}{(1 - 2s)^2}
   \]

3. **Solving for \( s \)**:
   Taking the square root:
   \[
   \frac{s}{1 - 2s} = \sqrt{4.872 \times 10^{-3}} \approx 0.0698
   \]
   Rearranging:
   \[
   s = 0.0698(1 - 2s)
   \]
   Solving:
   \[
   s + 0.1396s = 0.0698 \implies 1.1396s = 0.0698 \implies s \approx 0.0612 \, \text{M}
   \]

4. **Volume Calculation**:
   The moles of AgCl to dissolve are 0.01 mol. Using \( s = 0.0612 \, \text{M} \):
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Concentration}} = \frac{0.01}{0.0612} \approx 0.1634 \, \text{L} \approx 163.4 \, \text{ml}
   \]

5. **Comparison with Options**:
   The calculated volume (163.4 ml) does not match any option exactly. The closest option is **F: 154 ml**, which may account for approximations or rounding in the problem setup.

### Final Answer:
The most reasonable choice based on the calculations is **F: 154 ml**.

**Answer: F**
