Okay, so I have this question about the population of Teotihuacán at its peak. I'm not super familiar with ancient history, but I remember hearing a bit about this city. Let me try to think through this.

Teotihuacán was one of the major pre-Columbian cities in Mesoamerica, right? I think it's located in what's now Mexico. It was known for its large pyramids, like the Pyramid of the Sun and the Pyramid of the Moon. But what about the population?

I remember that many ancient cities had populations that were large but not as big as modern cities. For example, I think Tenochtitlan, the Aztec capital, had a population in the hundreds of thousands. But Teotihuacán was earlier, around the first few centuries CE, maybe?

I've heard estimates before, but I'm not sure if I remember them correctly. Let me try to recall. I think the population was somewhere in the tens of thousands to maybe a couple hundred thousand. So, looking at the options: A is 50,000, B is 200,000, C is 500,000, D is a million.

I'm pretty sure it's not a million. That seems too high for a city from that era without modern infrastructure. Also, I think Teotihuacán was the largest city in the Americas at the time, but even so, a million people seems excessive. I've heard that even the largest pre-Columbian cities, like Tenochtitlan, had populations maybe around 200,000 to 300,000. So maybe Teotihuacán was a bit smaller.

Wait, but I also remember reading that the population might have been as high as 200,000. Or was that another city? I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, I think some sources say that at its peak, Teotihuacán had between 100,000 and 200,000 people. That would make option B, 200,000, the correct answer.

But I'm not entirely certain. Let me think about other factors. The city was massive, covering a large area, so the population density might have been lower than modern cities. Maybe 200,000 is on the higher end of estimates but still plausible.

I think I'll go with B: 200,000 people as the peak population.

The city of Teotihuacán was a significant pre-Columbian metropolis, known for its vast pyramids and cultural achievements. While its exact population is debated, estimates suggest it was one of the largest cities in the Americas at the time. Considering historical context and scholarly estimates, the population likely peaked around 200,000 people. This aligns with the available evidence and avoids the improbability of a million inhabitants for that era.

Answer: B
