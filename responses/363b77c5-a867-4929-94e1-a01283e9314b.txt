Alright, I'm trying to figure out which of the given options is not considered a primary facial expression. I remember that there's a set of basic emotions that are recognized universally, and each has a corresponding facial expression. I think these are called the primary facial expressions.

Okay, so the options are A to F: surprise, contempt, fear, sadness, anger, and disgust. I need to recall what the primary ones are. I believe Paul Ekman was the psychologist who identified these. He found six basic emotions, each with distinct facial expressions.

Let me list them out as I remember: happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, and disgust. Wait, that's six. So where does contempt fit in? I think contempt is more of a secondary emotion or maybe a blend of others. Sometimes it's associated with anger and disgust. So maybe contempt isn't one of the primary ones.

Looking back at the options, the question is asking which is NOT a primary. So if the primary ones are surprise, fear, sadness, anger, and disgust, then B: contempt is the one that's not primary. The options given don't include happiness, which is another primary, but it's not in the question. So the answer should be B.

The primary facial expressions identified by Paul Ekman include surprise, fear, sadness, anger, and disgust. Contempt is not considered a primary facial expression but rather a secondary emotion. 

Answer: B
