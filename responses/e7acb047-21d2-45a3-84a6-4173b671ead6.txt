Okay, so I have this question about finding the 1's and 2's complements of some binary numbers. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that the 1's complement of a binary number is where each bit is flipped—0s become 1s and 1s become 0s. The 2's complement is then the 1's complement plus 1, which is used for representing negative numbers in binary.

Looking at the options, each one provides answers for parts a) to e). I think I'll go through each part one by one and see which option matches my calculations.

Starting with part a) 1010101.

1's complement: Flip each bit. So 1 becomes 0, 0 becomes 1. Let's do that:

Original: 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
Flip each: 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
So 1's complement is 0101010.

Now for 2's complement: Add 1 to the 1's complement. Let me add 1 to 0101010.

0101010
+      1
= 0101011

Wait, but looking at the options, I need to check which option has a) 1's complement as 0101010 and 2's as 0101011.

Looking at the options:

Option F for a) says 1's complement is 0101010, 2's is 1010101. Hmm, no, that's not right because 2's complement should be 0101011.

Option B for a) 1's is 0101011, which doesn't match. Option C's a) is 0101001 and 0101011? Wait, no, let me check each option.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check each option for a).

Option A: a) 1's is 1010100, 2's is 1010101. No, that's not matching.

Option B: a) 1's is 0101011, 2's is 0101100. No.

Option C: a) 1's is 0101010, 2's is 0101001. Wait, no, because 2's complement should be adding 1, so 0101010 +1 is 0101011. So C's a) 2's is wrong.

Option D: a) 1's is 1010101, same as original. That can't be right.

Option E: a) 1's is 1010101, same as original. No.

Option F: a) 1's is 0101010, 2's is 1010101. Wait, that's not right because adding 1 to 0101010 gives 0101011, not 1010101. So F is wrong.

Option G: a) 1's is 0101001, which is different from what I got.

Option H: a) 1's is 1111111, which doesn't match.

Option I: a) 1's is 0101011, no.

Option J: a) 1's is 0101010, which matches, and 2's is 0101011. So in option J, a) 2's is 0101011, which is correct. So J seems to have the right a).

Wait, but I need to check all parts, not just a). Let's try part b) 0111000.

1's complement: Flip each bit.

0 1 1 1 0 0 0
Flips: 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 → 1000111.

2's complement: Add 1. 1000111 +1 = 1001000.

Now check which option has b) 1's as 1000111 and 2's as 1001000.

Looking at the options:

Option J for b) says 1's is 1000111, 2's is 1001000. That's correct.

Now part c) is 0000001.

1's complement: Flip all bits → 1111110.

2's complement: Add 1 → 1111111.

Looking for c) in options:

Option J: c) 1's is 1111110, 2's is 1111111. Correct.

Part d) is 10000.

Wait, but how many bits are we considering here? Because the length affects the complement. For example, if it's a 5-bit number, 10000 would have a 1's complement as 01111 (since 5 bits).

1's complement of 10000 (5 bits) is 01111.

2's complement: 01111 +1 = 10000. Wait, that can't be right because 10000 is the original number. Wait, no, 01111 +1 = 10000, but that's a 5-bit number. So the 2's complement would be 10000, but that's the same as the original, which isn't possible. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, let me think again. For a 5-bit number 10000 (which is 16 in decimal), the 1's complement is flipping all bits: 01111. Then 2's complement is 01111 +1 = 10000, which is 16 again. But that would mean the 2's complement is the same as the original number, which is correct because 16 is a positive number, and in two's complement, positive numbers are represented as themselves. So that makes sense.

Looking at the options for d):

Option J: d) 1's is 01111, 2's is 10000. Which matches what I have.

Finally, part e) is 0000.

1's complement: Flip all bits → 1111.

2's complement: 1111 +1 = 10000. But since we're dealing with 4 bits, 10000 would be 0000 with a carryover, so it becomes 0000 again. Wait, no, in 4 bits, adding 1 to 1111 gives 0000 with a carry, but in two's complement, 0000 is 0, so that's correct.

Looking at the options for e):

Option J: e) 1's is 1111, 2's is 10000. But wait, since the number is 4 bits, maybe the 2's complement is 0000. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in the options, looking at J's e): 1's is 1111, 2's is 10000. But 10000 is 5 bits. The original number is 0000, which is 4 bits. So perhaps the 2's complement should be 0000 in 4 bits. But in two's complement, 1111 is -1, and adding 1 gives 0000. So in 4 bits, the 2's complement of 0000 would be 0000, because 0000 is 0, and its complement is itself.

Wait, but in the options, J's e) says 2's complement is 10000, which is 5 bits. But the question didn't specify the number of bits, so perhaps it's considering the same number of bits as the original. The original e) is 0000, which is 4 bits, so the 2's complement would be 0000, but that's not in any option. Wait, looking back:

Looking at the options again:

Option J: e) 1's complement: 1111, 2's complement: 10000. So 10000 is 5 bits, but perhaps the question allows for that.

Wait, but in the given options, only option J seems to have all parts correct except maybe part e). Let me check other options.

Looking back, part e) in the options:

Option E: e) 1's is 1111, 2's is 1110. No.

Option F: e) 1's is 1111, 2's is 0000. That's correct because 1111 (assuming 4 bits) +1 = 0000.

Wait, but in option F, e) 1's is 1111, 2's is 0000. That's correct.

Wait, but earlier in part a), option J had the correct a) and b). Let me check option F's a).

Option F: a) 1's is 0101010, 2's is 1010101. Wait, that's not correct because 2's complement should be 0101011, not 1010101.

So option F is wrong for a).

Wait, but in option J, e) says 2's complement is 10000, which is 5 bits. But the original e) is 0000, which is 4 bits. So perhaps the 2's complement should be 0000. But in option J, it's 10000, which is 16 in 5 bits. So maybe the options assume the same number of bits.

Wait, perhaps the question doesn't specify the number of bits, so for e) 0000, the 2's complement would be 10000 if we consider an extra bit, but that's not standard. Normally, 0000's complement is 0000.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to verify each part again.

For part e) 0000:

1's complement: 1111 (assuming same number of bits).

2's complement: 1111 +1 = 10000, but if we're limited to 4 bits, it overflows, so 0000.

So in 4 bits, 2's complement is 0000.

Looking at the options, which one has e) 1's as 1111 and 2's as 0000?

Option F: e) 1's is 1111, 2's is 0000. That's correct.

Option J: e) 1's is 1111, 2's is 10000. Which is 5 bits, so perhaps that's incorrect.

So if I go back, option J has the correct a) and b) but incorrect e). Option F has correct a), but for a), the 2's complement in F is 1010101, which is wrong because it should be 0101011.

Wait, no, in option F, a) 1's is 0101010, 2's is 1010101. That's incorrect because 2's complement should be 0101010 +1 = 0101011, not 1010101.

So perhaps none of the options are perfect, but let me check all the parts again.

Looking for each part in each option:

Option J:

a) 1's: 0101010, 2's: 0101011 (correct).

b) 1's: 1000111, 2's: 1001000 (correct).

c) 1's: 1111110, 2's: 1111111 (correct).

d) 1's: 01111, 2's: 10000 (correct).

e) 1's: 1111, 2's: 10000 (which is 5 bits, but perhaps acceptable as the question didn't specify bit length).

So option J seems to have all parts correct except maybe e). But wait, in the options, J's e) is 1's: 1111, 2's: 10000.

But let me check the options again. Wait, in the options, J's e) is 1111 for 1's and 10000 for 2's. That's correct because 1111 +1 = 10000, which is the 2's complement.

So perhaps the correct answer is option J.
</think>

The correct answer is option J. Each part of the question is addressed by flipping the bits for the 1's complement and adding 1 for the 2's complement. Option J matches all the calculated values correctly.

J
