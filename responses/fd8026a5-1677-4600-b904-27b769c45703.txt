Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to break it down step by step. The question has two parts, (a) and (b). I'll tackle them one by one.

Starting with part (a): It's about finding the acceleration due to gravity on the moon's surface, g_m, compared to Earth's gravity, g_e. The given information is that the moon's diameter is one-quarter of Earth's, and its density is two-thirds of Earth's. 

Hmm, I remember that the acceleration due to gravity on a planet's surface is given by the formula g = G*M/R², where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the planet, and R is its radius. Since we're comparing the moon and Earth, maybe I can express g_m in terms of g_e.

Wait, but let's think about the relationship between mass, radius, and density. Density (ρ) is mass (M) divided by volume (V), and for a sphere, V = (4/3)πR³. So, ρ = M/( (4/3)πR³ ). Rearranging, M = ρ * (4/3)πR³. 

So, substituting M into the gravity formula: g = G*(ρ*(4/3)πR³) / R² = G*(4ρπ/3) * R. So, g is proportional to ρ*R. That makes sense because gravity depends on both the mass (which depends on density and size) and the radius.

Now, let's compare the moon and Earth. Let’s denote Earth’s density as ρ_e and radius as R_e, and the moon's as ρ_m and R_m.

Given that R_m = (1/4) R_e because the moon's diameter is a quarter of Earth's. Also, ρ_m = (2/3) ρ_e.

So, g_m = G*(4 ρ_m π/3) * R_m.

Substituting the values:

g_m = (G * 4 * (2/3 ρ_e) * π / 3) * (1/4 R_e)

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to express g_m in terms of g_e. Since g_e = G*M_e / R_e², and M_e = ρ_e * (4/3 π R_e³).

So, g_e = G * (ρ_e * (4/3 π R_e³)) / R_e² = G * (4/3 π ρ_e) R_e.

Similarly, g_m = G * (4/3 π ρ_m) R_m.

Now, substitute ρ_m = (2/3) ρ_e and R_m = (1/4) R_e.

So, g_m = G * (4/3 π) * (2/3 ρ_e) * (1/4 R_e).

Let me compute the coefficients:

(2/3) * (1/4) = 2/(12) = 1/6.

So, g_m = G * (4/3 π) * (1/6 ρ_e R_e) = (1/6) * [ G * (4/3 π ρ_e R_e) ) ].

Wait, but G*(4/3 π ρ_e R_e) is g_e. Because from earlier, g_e = G*(4/3 π ρ_e) R_e. So, substituting, g_m = (1/6) g_e.

So, part (a) gives g_m = (1/6) g_e. That would match option A, F, J, etc. Looking at the options, option A says g_m = 1/6 g_e, and part (b) would then have 12 ft. So maybe the answer is A or another option.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through again.

g_m = (4/3 π G) * ρ_m * R_m.

But g_e = (4/3 π G) * ρ_e * R_e.

So, g_m / g_e = (ρ_m / ρ_e) * (R_m / R_e).

Given that ρ_m = (2/3) ρ_e and R_m = (1/4) R_e.

So, (2/3) * (1/4) = 2/(12) = 1/6. So, yes, g_m = (1/6) g_e. So, part (a) is 1/6 of Earth's gravity.

Now, moving to part (b): An astronaut can jump 2 ft vertically on Earth. How high can he jump on the Moon?

I think this is about the same energy being used, but since gravity is different, the height will be different. When the astronaut jumps, he uses energy to lift himself against gravity. The energy stored in his muscles (or the kinetic energy) translates into potential energy when he jumps.

Assuming that the energy he expends is the same on both Earth and the Moon, the height would be inversely proportional to the gravitational acceleration.

Wait, but maybe another approach: The maximum height reached when jumping can be found using kinematic equations. The initial velocity when he leaves the ground can be found from the height on Earth. Then, with the same initial velocity on the Moon, the height would be different due to the lower gravity.

Alternatively, the maximum height H is given by v²/(2g), where v is the initial velocity upon takeoff.

But perhaps a simpler way is to realize that the energy used to jump is the same. So, the kinetic energy (KE) is converted into gravitational potential energy (PE). So, KE = mgh, where h is the height. So, if the astronaut uses the same KE, then h is proportional to g. Because KE = (1/2)mv², but when he jumps, this becomes mgh, so h = v²/(2g). So, with same v, h is inversely proportional to g.

Wait, but another way: the energy E is the same, so E = m g_e h_e on Earth, and E = m g_m h_m on the Moon. So, m g_e h_e = m g_m h_m → h_m = (g_e / g_m) h_e.

Since g_m = (1/6) g_e, h_m = (g_e / (1/6 g_e)) * h_e = 6 * h_e.

Given that on Earth, h_e is 2 ft, then on the Moon, h_m = 6 * 2 = 12 ft.

So, part (b) is 12 ft.

Looking at the options, option A says g_m = 1/6 g_e and 12 ft. So, the answer should be option A.

The acceleration due to gravity on the moon's surface is calculated using the relationship between density, radius, and gravitational acceleration. Since the moon's diameter is one-quarter of Earth's and its density is two-thirds of Earth's, the moon's gravity is (1/6) of Earth's. For the astronaut's jump, the maximum height is inversely proportional to gravity, resulting in a jump height of 12 feet on the moon.
