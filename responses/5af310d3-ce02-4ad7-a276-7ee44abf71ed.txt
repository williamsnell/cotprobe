Question:

A football team entered into a 10-year lease with a city for use of the city's athletic stadium. Five years into the lease, the team threatened to leave the stadium and move to another city. The city sued the team in federal court, seeking a permanent injunction to prevent the team from breaching its lease and leaving. In its answer, the team included a counterclaim seeking $10 million in damages for losses caused by the city's alleged failure to properly maintain the stadium, as the lease required. The team demanded a jury trial on the counterclaim. The city moved to try its claim for a permanent injunction before the trial on the team's counterclaim. The team objected and moved that the jury trial of its counterclaim be held before the trial of the city's injunction claim. How should the court rule on the parties' motions?

Options:

A: The court should first hold a nonjury trial of the city's claim without giving binding effect to its findings or conclusions in the later jury trial of the team's counterclaim.
B: The court should first hold a jury trial of the team's counterclaim, and its findings should be binding in the later nonjury trial of the city's claim.
C: The court should first hold a nonjury trial of the team's counterclaim, and then a jury trial of the city's claim.
D: The court should schedule a jury trial of both the city's claim and the team's counterclaim.
E: The court should hold a simultaneous jury trial of the team's counterclaim and nonjury trial of the city's claim.
F: The court should first hold a jury trial of the city's claim, and then a nonjury trial of the team's counterclaim.
G: The court should first hold a jury trial of the team's counterclaim, and then a nonjury trial of the issues remaining in the city's claim.
H: The court should schedule a nonjury trial of both the city's claim and the team's counterclaim.
I: The court should first hold a nonjury trial of the city's claim, and then a jury trial of the issues remaining in the team's counterclaim.
J: The court should first hold a nonjury trial of the city's claim, and its findings should be binding in the later jury trial of the team's counterclaim.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about a football team's lease and the court procedure. Let me break it down step by step.

The football team has a 10-year lease with the city. Five years in, they threaten to leave. The city sues them in federal court for a permanent injunction to stop them from breaching the lease. Then, the team files a counterclaim, saying the city didn't maintain the stadium properly and they're asking for $10 million in damages. They want a jury trial for their counterclaim. The city wants to try their claim for the injunction first, without a jury, and then maybe the counterclaim later. The team objects, wanting the jury trial on their counterclaim first.

I remember that in federal courts, the rules about jury trials are important. Rule 38 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure deals with jury trials. From what I recall, a party has the right to a jury trial if they timely demand it. The court usually grants the right unless the issue is one that traditionally doesn't have a jury trial, like equitable claims.

The city is seeking an injunction, which is an equitable remedy. Historically, injunctions were handled in equity courts, which didn't use juries. So, the city's claim for the injunction would likely be tried without a jury. On the other hand, the team's counterclaim for damages sounds like a legal claim, so they're entitled to a jury trial.

But the issue here is the order in which these trials should happen. The city wants to try their injunction claim first as a nonjury trial. The team wants their jury trial on the counterclaim first. 

I think about the concept of election of remedies. If the city gets an injunction first, that might moot the counterclaim because if the team is enjoined from leaving, there might be no need for damages. But wait, in this case, the city is seeking an injunction to prevent the team from breaching, and the team is counterclaiming about past failures by the city. The team's counterclaim is about past damages, not about whether they can continue the lease. So maybe the two claims are separate.

But I'm not sure if the order affects the outcome. Another point is that if the city's claim is tried first without a jury, the findings could affect the jury's consideration of the counterclaim. But if the counterclaim is a separate issue, perhaps it's better to try the jury trial first on the team's claim so that the jury's findings can be used if needed.

Wait, but the city's motion is to try their claim first as a nonjury, and the team wants their own trial first. The question is about procedure. I think the rules allow for separate trials on separate issues, especially if they involve different types of relief.

In federal court, when there are multiple claims, the court can order separate trials. If the city's claim is for an injunction (equitable), it's a bench trial. The team's counterclaim is for damages (legal), so it's a jury trial. The court can decide the order.

I'm trying to remember if the party who demands a jury trial can have their issue tried first. Or does the nature of the claims determine the order? I think the court has discretion, but the right to a jury trial must be respected.

Looking at the options, option J says the court should first hold a nonjury trial of the city's claim, and its findings should be binding in the later jury trial of the team's counterclaim. That makes sense because the city's claim is equitable, so a bench trial first. Then, the team's counterclaim, which is legal, would be a jury trial. The findings from the bench trial could be used as binding in the jury trial because they're findings of fact that don't require a jury.

Alternatively, option A suggests a nonjury trial of the city's claim without binding effect. But that doesn't seem right because the city's claim is about whether the team can be enjoined, which might affect the counterclaim.

Wait, but in the counterclaim, the team is saying the city failed to maintain, which might be a fact that the court would need to determine. If the city's claim is tried first, the court's findings could influence the jury's consideration of the counterclaim. But in a jury trial, the jury would decide the facts based on their own consideration. However, if the court's bench trial has already found certain facts, those could be admitted as evidence in the jury trial as binding, or the jury would have to decide de novo.

I think if the bench trial's findings are on issues of fact that are relevant to the counterclaim, they could be binding. So the court's findings from the nonjury trial would be binding on the jury trial, making option J correct.

Alternatively, if the court holds the bench trial first and the jury trial later, the bench findings are binding on the jury. That would be option J.

Another point: The team's counterclaim is a separate claim, so the jury trial on that should proceed as a separate matter. The city's claim is for an injunction, which is a different relief.

So the court should first try the city's claim without a jury, then the team's counterclaim with a jury, with the bench trial's findings being binding. So the answer is J.

The court should first hold a nonjury trial of the city's claim, and its findings should be binding in the later jury trial of the team's counterclaim.
