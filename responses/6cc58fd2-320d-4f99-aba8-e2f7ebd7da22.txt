Alright, I've got this logic problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. So, the question is about determining whether two propositions are logically equivalent, contradictory, consistent, or inconsistent. The propositions given are ~O ⊃ P and O ∨ P. The options are from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I think I should construct the truth tables for both propositions. Truth tables are a good way to compare the logical relationships between statements. Let's list out the possible truth values for O and P. Since each can be either true (T) or false (F), there are four combinations: TT, TF, FT, FF.

Starting with the first proposition: ~O ⊃ P. This is a material implication, which means if ~O is true, then P must be true. Alternatively, if ~O is false, the implication is automatically true regardless of P. So, let's compute the value of ~O ⊃ P for each combination.

For the second proposition: O ∨ P. This is a disjunction, so it's true if either O is true, P is true, or both.

Let me list out the four possible rows for O and P:

1. O=T, P=T
2. O=T, P=F
3. O=F, P=T
4. O=F, P=F

Now, let's compute each part.

First row: O=T, P=T
~O = ~T = F
So, ~O ⊃ P becomes F ⊃ T. In logic, an implication with a false antecedent is always true. So, this is T.

O ∨ P is T ∨ T, which is T.

Second row: O=T, P=F
~O = F
~O ⊃ P is F ⊃ F, which is T (since implication is only false when antecedent is T and consequent is F).
O ∨ P is T ∨ F, which is T.

Third row: O=F, P=T
~O = T
~O ⊃ P is T ⊃ T, which is T.
O ∨ P is F ∨ T, which is T.

Fourth row: O=F, P=F
~O = T
~O ⊃ P is T ⊃ F, which is F.
O ∨ P is F ∨ F, which is F.

So now, let's summarize the results:

For ~O ⊃ P:
- TT: T
- TF: T
- FT: T
- FF: F

For O ∨ P:
- TT: T
- TF: T
- FT: T
- FF: F

Wait a minute, both propositions have the same truth values in all four rows. That means their truth tables are identical. If two statements have identical truth tables, they are logically equivalent. So, ~O ⊃ P and O ∨ P are logically equivalent.

But wait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in evaluating the implications.

In the first row, ~O is F, so implication is T. That's correct.

Second row, same as first.

Third row, ~O is T, P is T, so T implies T is T.

Fourth row, ~O is T, P is F, so implication is F.

And for O ∨ P, in the fourth row, both are F, so it's F. So yes, both have the same outputs.

Therefore, they are logically equivalent. So, looking at the options, H is "Logically equivalent." Are there any other possibilities? Let me check the options again.

Option H is one of the choices. So, the answer should be H.

The propositions ~O ⊃ P and O ∨ P have identical truth tables across all possible truth values for O and P. Since their truth tables are the same, they are logically equivalent.

Answer: H
