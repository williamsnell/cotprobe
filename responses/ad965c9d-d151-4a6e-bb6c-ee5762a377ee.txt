Question:

A mother has an 11-year-old daughter. The mother is legally separated from her husband and has filed for divorce. The mother and her husband own their home in joint tenancy. One night, the mother went out to dinner and left her daughter at home. Upon leaving the house, the mother locked the door to her bedroom. While the mother was gone, the daughter found a spare key to her mother's bedroom and opened the door. While rummaging through her mother's dresser, she found a bag containing white powder. Concerned that the bag might contain drugs, the daughter called her father to ask his advice. The husband instructed her to call the police. The daughter then telephoned the police station and reported what she had found. A patrol car was immediately dispatched to her home. The daughter allowed the police to come inside and led them to her mother's bedroom. She gave the officers the bag, which they took to the station house for a lab test. After the results confirmed that the bag contained cocaine, the mother was arrested and charged with illegal possession of a controlled dangerous substance. The mother's attorney has filed a motion to prevent the cocaine from being admitted into evidence. The motion should be

Options:

A: denied, because the daughter, and husband, as co-owner, had the authority to allow the police inside the home and make the seizure.
B: denied, because the police were acting on the daughter's concern for her mother's wellbeing.
C: denied, because the daughter lived with her mother and had equal control over the premises.
D: denied, because the daughter had a reasonable concern for her mother's safety.
E: denied, because the cocaine was found in a common area of the home, not a private space.
F: granted, because the daughter did not have apparent authority to permit the police to enter her mother's bedroom.
G: granted, because the husband did not physically give consent for the police to enter the home.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let me read through the scenario carefully.

So, the mother and her husband are legally separated and own their home in joint tenancy. The mother went out, locked her bedroom, and left her 11-year-old daughter at home. The daughter found a spare key, went into her mother's bedroom, found a bag with white powder, called her dad, who told her to call the police. The daughter did, the police came in, took the bag, which tested positive for cocaine, and the mother was arrested.

The question is whether the motion to exclude the cocaine from evidence should be granted or denied. The options are A to G.

I remember that in criminal procedure, the Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. For a search to be valid, it typically needs a warrant, unless there's an exception. One exception is consent. If a person with authority over the premises consents to the search, then the police can conduct it without a warrant.

Here, the daughter found the key, entered her mother's room, and called the police. The key point is whether the daughter had the authority to consent to the police entering her mother's bedroom.

Joint tenancy means both owners have equal rights to the property, but does that extend to each room? The mother locked her bedroom door, so perhaps she intended to keep the daughter out. But the daughter found a spare key, meaning she had access. But does that mean she had the authority to let the police in?

I think that for consent to be valid, it must be given by someone with "apparent authority." The person must have the right to allow others to enter the premises. If the mother and husband are joint tenants, normally either could consent to a search of the entire home. But the bedroom is specifically hers. She locked it, and only the daughter had a spare key. So, does the daughter have the authority to let the police in?

Wait, the daughter is a minor. She's 11. Does her age affect her ability to consent? I think minors can give consent, but it might depend on the circumstances. But in this case, the issue is whether she had the authority to consent to the police entering her mother's bedroom.

The mother had locked her bedroom, so perhaps she didn't want the daughter or others to enter. But the daughter found a key, so she could access it. But does that mean she had the right to let the police in? Or does the mother's act of locking the door imply that she didn't want others, including the daughter, to access that space?

I'm a bit confused. If the mother and husband are joint tenants, they both have the right to the entire home. So the husband could consent to a search of the home, including the mother's bedroom. But what about the daughter? She's a minor living there. Does she have the authority to consent?

I think that generally, a co-tenant can consent to a search of the shared areas, but not necessarily another co-tenant's private space. But in joint tenancy, the concept is a bit different. Each has the right to the entire premises. So, perhaps the husband, as a co-owner, could consent to the entire home being searched, including the mother's bedroom. But the daughter is not a co-owner; she's a minor living there.

Wait, but the daughter found the key and entered her mother's room. She then called her father, who told her to call the police. The daughter then let the police in. So, the police entered the home with the daughter's consent, but the mother's bedroom is specifically hers.

I think the key here is whether the daughter had the authority to consent to the police entering her mother's bedroom. Since the mother had locked the door, and the daughter only had a spare key, maybe the daughter didn't have the authority. Because the mother's act of locking the door could indicate that she didn't want others, including the daughter, to enter her bedroom without permission.

So, if the daughter didn't have the authority to consent to the police entering her mother's bedroom, then the seizure of the cocaine would be illegal. Therefore, the motion to suppress should be granted.

Looking at the options, F says granted because the daughter didn't have apparent authority. G says granted because the husband didn't physically consent. But the husband told the daughter to call the police, but he didn't actually give consent himself. So perhaps F is the correct answer.

The question revolves around whether the police's entry into the mother's bedroom and the seizure of the cocaine were lawful. The Fourth Amendment requires that searches and seizures be reasonable, and consent is a valid exception. However, for consent to be effective, the person giving consent must have apparent authority over the premises.

In this case, the daughter, though a minor, found a spare key to her mother's locked bedroom and allowed the police inside. The critical issue is whether the daughter had the authority to consent to the police entering her mother's private space. The mother had specifically locked her bedroom, which suggests she intended to restrict access to that area. The daughter's possession of a spare key does not necessarily confer authority to permit a police search of her mother's private space.

The husband, as a joint tenant, could have consented to a search of the entire home, but the daughter, not being a co-owner, did not have the authority to consent to the police entering her mother's bedroom. Therefore, the police's actions were unlawful, and the motion to suppress the evidence should be granted.
