Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a nuclear reaction, and I'm trying to figure out the mass of the neutron. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The reaction given is _5B^11 + _2He^4 → _7N^14 + _0n^1. So it's Boron-11 reacting with an alpha particle (which is He-4) to produce Nitrogen-14 and a neutron. The masses given are for Boron (11.01280 amu), Nitrogen (14.00752 amu), and the alpha particle (4.00387 amu). The incident alpha particle had 5.250 MeV of kinetic energy. After the reaction, the neutron has 3.260 MeV of energy, and the Nitrogen atom has 2.139 MeV. The question is, what's the mass of the neutron?

Hmm, I remember that in nuclear reactions, mass and energy are related through Einstein's equation E=mc². So the idea here is probably to use conservation of energy and mass to find the missing mass of the neutron.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The reaction is a type of fusion or maybe fission? I'm more familiar with fission, but the specifics might not matter here. The key point is that the total energy before and after should balance, considering the kinetic energies and the masses involved.

So, the initial kinetic energy comes from the alpha particle, which is moving towards the Boron nucleus. The Boron nucleus is probably stationary because it's not mentioned, so I can assume it's at rest. The products, the Nitrogen and neutron, are moving with certain kinetic energies.

I think the approach here is to calculate the total initial energy and the total final energy, then find the missing mass from the neutron.

Wait, but the masses provided include the alpha particle, Boron, and Nitrogen. The neutron's mass is what we're trying to find. So, perhaps I need to consider the conservation of baryons and the mass-energy equivalence.

Wait, in nuclear reactions, the total mass before the reaction should equal the total mass after, considering the binding energy, but in this case, since it's a reaction, there might be a mass defect or surplus. Alternatively, maybe I need to calculate the Q value of the reaction, which is the energy released or absorbed.

The Q value is the difference between the initial and final masses, multiplied by c². So Q = (mass_initial - mass_final) * c². But since the reaction is given, perhaps the kinetic energy of the products comes from this Q value.

Wait, but the kinetic energies are given. So perhaps the initial kinetic energy of the alpha plus the initial rest mass (including the Boron nucleus's rest mass) equals the sum of the rest masses of the products plus their kinetic energies.

Wait, but let's clarify. The initial system has the alpha particle with kinetic energy and the Boron nucleus at rest. The mass of the Boron nucleus is given as 11.01280 amu. The alpha particle's mass is 4.00387 amu, but it's moving with KE. The final products are Nitrogen (14.00752 amu) and neutron (unknown mass, let's call it m_n).

Wait, but the alpha particle's total energy isn't just its rest mass; it's the sum of its rest mass and its kinetic energy. So the total initial energy is the rest mass of Boron plus the total energy of the alpha (rest mass plus KE). The total final energy is the rest mass of Nitrogen plus the rest mass of the neutron plus the kinetic energies of both products.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the kinetic energies are given as just the kinetic parts, so perhaps the total energy after is the sum of rest masses plus the kinetic energies. But I might be mixing up the concepts here. Let me try to write the conservation equations.

The conservation of energy equation would be:

Initial total energy = Final total energy.

The initial total energy is the sum of the Boron's rest energy and the alpha's total energy (rest + kinetic).

The final total energy is the sum of Nitrogen's rest energy, neutron's rest energy, neutron's kinetic energy, and Nitrogen's kinetic energy.

So,

E_initial = E_Boron + E_alpha_total,

E_final = E_Nitrogen + E_neutron_rest + KE_N + KE_n.

But wait, E_alpha_total is the rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy. Similarly, E_Boron is just its rest mass energy since it's at rest.

So,

E_initial = (m_B * c²) + (m_He * c² + KE_He)

E_final = (m_N * c²) + (m_n * c²) + KE_N + KE_n

Since energy is conserved, E_initial = E_final.

Rearranging,

m_B * c² + m_He * c² + KE_He = m_N * c² + m_n * c² + KE_N + KE_n

We can subtract m_N * c² and m_n * c² from both sides and bring the KE terms to the left:

(m_B + m_He - m_N - m_n) * c² + KE_He - KE_N - KE_n = 0

But I think I'm complicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the mass defect (the difference in masses) is converted into kinetic energy.

Wait, that's another approach. The Q value is the total energy released, which is the mass difference times c². Then, the kinetic energies of the products come from that Q value.

So, the Q value is (m_initial - m_final) * c², where m_initial is the sum of the masses of Boron and alpha, and m_final is the sum of Nitrogen and neutron.

So,

Q = (m_B + m_He - m_N - m_n) * c²

But the kinetic energies of the products are part of the Q value. So,

Q = KE_N + KE_n

Wait, but in reality, the total kinetic energy of the products is equal to the Q value minus any energy carried away by any other particles, but in this case, I think it's just these two products, so Q = KE_N + KE_n.

Wait, but the initial kinetic energy is given as the alpha's KE. So perhaps the initial kinetic energy is part of the Q value as well? Or maybe the Q value includes the kinetic energy of the products, but that's a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial kinetic energy is part of the system's energy, and the rest masses are converted into the products' rest masses plus their kinetic energies.

Wait, maybe I should approach this by considering that the initial system's total energy is the sum of the rest mass energies and the kinetic energy of the alpha. The final system's energy is the sum of the rest masses of Nitrogen and neutron plus their kinetic energies.

So,

m_B * c² + (m_He * c² + KE_He) = m_N * c² + m_n * c² + KE_N + KE_n

Then, rearranging:

(m_B + m_He - m_N - m_n) * c² = KE_N + KE_n - KE_He

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the KE_He is part of the initial energy, so the equation should include all the energies.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to calculate the total energy before and after, and then find the mass of the neutron.

Let me write down all the known values:

m_B = 11.01280 amu

m_He = 4.00387 amu

m_N = 14.00752 amu

KE_He = 5.250 MeV

KE_N = 2.139 MeV

KE_n = 3.260 MeV

We're to find m_n.

Wait, but wait a second. The neutron's kinetic energy is given as 3.260 MeV, but the Nitrogen's kinetic energy is 2.139 MeV. So the total kinetic energy after the reaction is 3.260 + 2.139 = 5.399 MeV.

The initial kinetic energy is 5.250 MeV, so the total kinetic energy increased by 5.399 - 5.250 = 0.149 MeV. That might not make sense because in most reactions, the kinetic energy is either released or absorbed, but perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the initial kinetic energy is part of the system's energy, and the rest mass difference leads to the kinetic energies of the products.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the total initial energy and set it equal to the total final energy, including the rest masses and kinetic energies.

Let me try to write the equation again.

The total initial energy is the energy of the Boron nucleus (which is at rest, so its energy is just m_B * c²) plus the total energy of the alpha particle, which is its rest energy plus its kinetic energy. So,

E_initial = m_B * c² + (m_He * c² + KE_He)

The total final energy is the rest energy of Nitrogen (m_N * c²) plus the rest energy of the neutron (m_n * c²) plus their kinetic energies.

E_final = m_N * c² + m_n * c² + KE_N + KE_n

Since energy is conserved, E_initial = E_final.

So,

m_B c² + (m_He c² + KE_He) = m_N c² + m_n c² + KE_N + KE_n

We can rearrange terms to solve for m_n:

m_n c² = m_B c² + m_He c² + KE_He - m_N c² - KE_N - KE_n

Then,

m_n = [ (m_B + m_He - m_N) c² + KE_He - KE_N - KE_n ] / c²

Wait, but that seems a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps I should factor out c².

Wait, but in terms of amu and MeV, I know that 1 amu is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So,

E = m * c², so m = E / c².

Wait, perhaps I should convert all the masses to energy terms using this conversion factor.

Let me try that. Let's compute each term in MeV.

First, compute m_B + m_He - m_N:

m_B = 11.01280 amu → 11.01280 * 931.5 ≈ ?

Wait, let me compute each mass in MeV/c²:

m_B = 11.01280 amu → 11.01280 * 931.5 ≈ let's calculate:

11 * 931.5 = 10246.5

0.0128 * 931.5 ≈ 11.885

So total ≈ 10246.5 + 11.885 ≈ 10258.385 MeV/c²

Similarly,

m_He = 4.00387 amu → 4.00387 * 931.5 ≈ ?

4 * 931.5 = 3726

0.00387 * 931.5 ≈ 3.607 MeV/c²

Total ≈ 3726 + 3.607 ≈ 3729.607 MeV/c²

m_N = 14.00752 amu → 14.00752 * 931.5 ≈ ?

14 * 931.5 = 13041

0.00752 * 931.5 ≈ 6.994

Total ≈ 13041 + 6.994 ≈ 13047.994 MeV/c²

So,

m_B + m_He - m_N = (10258.385 + 3729.607) - 13047.994

Adding the first two: 10258.385 + 3729.607 ≈ 13987.992

Subtract m_N: 13987.992 - 13047.994 ≈ 939.998 MeV/c²

So,

(m_B + m_He - m_N) c² = 939.998 MeV

Now, the initial kinetic energy of the alpha is 5.250 MeV.

The kinetic energies of Nitrogen and neutron are 2.139 MeV and 3.260 MeV, respectively. So,

KE_N + KE_n = 2.139 + 3.260 = 5.399 MeV

Now, putting it all into the energy conservation equation:

E_initial = E_final

(m_B c²) + (m_He c² + KE_He) = (m_N c²) + (m_n c²) + KE_N + KE_n

So,

(m_B + m_He) c² + KE_He = m_N c² + m_n c² + KE_N + KE_n

Rearranging,

(m_B + m_He - m_N) c² + KE_He = m_n c² + KE_N + KE_n

From earlier, (m_B + m_He - m_N) c² = 939.998 MeV

So,

939.998 MeV + 5.250 MeV = m_n c² + 2.139 MeV + 3.260 MeV

Left side: 939.998 + 5.250 = 945.248 MeV

Right side: m_n c² + (2.139 + 3.260) = m_n c² + 5.399 MeV

So,

945.248 MeV = m_n c² + 5.399 MeV

Subtract 5.399 MeV from both sides:

945.248 - 5.399 = m_n c² → 939.849 MeV = m_n c²

So,

m_n = 939.849 MeV / c²

But wait, 1 amu is 931.5 MeV/c², so:

m_n = 939.849 / 931.5 ≈ 1.009 amu

Wait, but let me compute that more accurately.

939.849 / 931.5 ≈ Let's see:

931.5 * 1.009 ≈ 931.5 + (931.5 * 0.009) ≈ 931.5 + 8.3835 ≈ 940.8835

But I have 939.849, which is less than that. So perhaps 1.009 is a bit high.

Wait, let me compute 939.849 / 931.5.

Dividing 939.849 by 931.5:

931.5 goes into 939.849 once, with a remainder.

939.849 - 931.5 = 8.349

So, it's 1 + 8.349 / 931.5 ≈ 1 + 0.00896 ≈ 1.00896 amu.

Looking at the options, option J is 1.00915 amu, which is very close. Option E is 1.00899, which is also close.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the energy terms. Let me double-check the steps.

Wait, the equation after substitution was:

939.998 MeV + 5.250 MeV = m_n c² + 5.399 MeV

So 939.998 +5.25 = 945.248 MeV

945.248 = m_n c² + 5.399

So m_n c² = 945.248 -5.399 = 939.849 MeV

So m_n = 939.849 /931.5 = ?

Let me compute 931.5 * 1.009 = ?

1.009 *931.5 = 931.5 + 0.009 *931.5

0.009 *931.5 = 8.3835

So 931.5 +8.3835=939.8835 MeV.

Wait, but m_n c² is 939.849 MeV, which is slightly less than 939.8835.

So 939.849 /931.5 = ?

Compute 939.849 /931.5:

939.849 ≈ 931.5 * 1.009 approx.

Let me compute 931.5 * x = 939.849.

x = 939.849 / 931.5 ≈ let's compute:

931.5 * 1.009 = 939.8835 as above.

But 939.849 is 939.8835 - 0.0345.

So the difference is 0.0345 MeV.

So x is 1.009 - (0.0345 /931.5).

0.0345 /931.5 ≈ 0.000037.

So x ≈ 1.008963.

Which is approximately 1.00896 amu.

Looking at the options, option E is 1.00899 amu, which is very close. Option J is 1.00915, which is a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of m_B + m_He - m_N.

Let me recalculate that.

m_B = 11.01280 amu

m_He = 4.00387 amu

m_N =14.00752 amu

So m_B + m_He = 11.01280 +4.00387 = 15.01667 amu

m_N =14.00752 amu

So m_B + m_He - m_N = 15.01667 -14.00752 =1.00915 amu.

Wait, wait a second! I think I messed up this calculation earlier. Because 15.01667 -14.00752 is 1.00915 amu.

But earlier I thought that this value, when multiplied by c², would give the energy. But that doesn't make sense because the units don't match. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the mass difference in amu and then convert that to energy.

So,

m_initial = m_B + m_He = 11.01280 + 4.00387 = 15.01667 amu

m_final = m_N + m_n =14.00752 + m_n

So the mass difference is (m_initial - m_final) = (15.01667 -14.00752 -m_n) = (1.00915 - m_n) amu.

So,

(m_initial - m_final) = (1.00915 - m_n) amu.

The Q value is (m_initial - m_final) * c², which is the energy released.

But the Q value is also equal to the sum of the kinetic energies of the products, assuming that the initial kinetic energy is part of the reaction's energy.

Wait, but no, the Q value is the total energy released, which includes the kinetic energies of the products. So,

Q = (m_initial - m_final) * c² = KE_N + KE_n + any other kinetic energies. But in this case, the only products are Nitrogen and neutron, so Q = KE_N + KE_n.

Wait, but the initial kinetic energy of the alpha particle is given as 5.250 MeV. So perhaps the total initial energy is the rest mass of Boron plus the total energy of the alpha (rest + kinetic). The total energy after is the rest mass of Nitrogen plus neutron plus their kinetic energies.

Wait, perhaps the correct equation is:

m_B c² + (m_He c² + KE_He) = (m_N c² + KE_N) + (m_n c² + KE_n)

But this seems a bit off because the neutron's rest mass is what we're trying to find.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial kinetic energy is part of the system's energy, and the rest masses convert into the products' rest masses plus their kinetic energies.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the total energy before and after, considering that the kinetic energy is converted into mass difference plus the kinetic energies of the products.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the conservation of energy, including the rest mass energies and kinetic energies.

But perhaps a better approach is to calculate the mass of the neutron using the conservation of energy and the fact that the initial kinetic energy is part of the system.

Wait, maybe I should use the following formula:

m_n = (m_He + m_B - m_N) - (KE_N + KE_n - KE_He) / c²

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to write the equation again.

The initial energy is the sum of the rest energy of Boron and the total energy of the alpha particle (rest + kinetic):

E_initial = m_B c² + (m_He c² + KE_He)

The final energy is the sum of the rest energy of Nitrogen, the rest energy of the neutron, and their kinetic energies:

E_final = m_N c² + m_n c² + KE_N + KE_n

Since energy is conserved:

m_B c² + m_He c² + KE_He = m_N c² + m_n c² + KE_N + KE_n

Rearranging terms:

m_n c² = m_B c² + m_He c² + KE_He - m_N c² - KE_N - KE_n

So,

m_n = [ (m_B + m_He - m_N) c² + KE_He - KE_N - KE_n ] / c²

Wait, that doesn't seem right because the units don't match. Let me think again. Actually, the equation should be:

m_n = [ (m_B + m_He - m_N) c² + KE_He - KE_N - KE_n ] / c²

But that would give m_n in amu, but the KE terms are in MeV, and c² is in MeV per amu. So perhaps I should express everything in terms of amu.

Alternatively, perhaps I should rearrange the equation to solve for m_n in terms of amu.

So,

m_n = [ (m_B + m_He - m_N) + (KE_He - KE_N - KE_n)/c² ] 

Because m_n c² = (some terms in MeV), so m_n = (those terms) / c².

Wait, but KE terms are in MeV, and c² is 931.5 MeV/amu.

So,

(KE_He - KE_N - KE_n) = 5.250 - 2.139 -3.260 = 5.250 -5.399 = -0.149 MeV

So,

m_n = (m_B + m_He - m_N) + (KE_He - KE_N - KE_n)/c²

But (KE_He - KE_N - KE_n) is negative, so:

m_n = (m_B + m_He - m_N) + (-0.149 MeV) / (931.5 MeV/amu)

So,

m_n = (1.00915 amu) + (-0.149 /931.5) amu

Compute -0.149 /931.5 ≈ -0.00016 amu

So,

m_n ≈ 1.00915 - 0.00016 ≈ 1.00899 amu

Looking at the options, option E is 1.00899 amu. So that's the answer.
</think>

The reaction involves Boron-11 (_5B^11) and an alpha particle (_2He^4) producing Nitrogen-14 (_7N^14) and a neutron (_0n^1). The goal is to determine the mass of the neutron using conservation of energy.

### Key Steps:
1. **Conservation of Energy**:  
   The total initial energy equals the total final energy:
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\text{final}}
   \]
   - **Initial Energy**:  
     \(E_{\text{initial}} = m_B c^2 + (m_{\alpha} c^2 + KE_{\alpha})\)  
     where \(m_B = 11.01280 \, \text{amu}\), \(m_{\alpha} = 4.00387 \, \text{amu}\), and \(KE_{\alpha} = 5.250 \, \text{MeV}\).
   - **Final Energy**:  
     \(E_{\text{final}} = m_N c^2 + m_n c^2 + KE_N + KE_n\)  
     where \(m_N = 14.00752 \, \text{amu}\), \(KE_N = 2.139 \, \text{MeV}\), and \(KE_n = 3.260 \, \text{MeV}\).

2. **Rearranging for \(m_n\)**:  
   Substituting into the conservation equation:
   \[
   m_n c^2 = m_B c^2 + m_{\alpha} c^2 + KE_{\alpha} - m_N c^2 - KE_N - KE_n
   \]
   Dividing through by \(c^2\):
   \[
   m_n = (m_B + m_{\alpha} - m_N) + \frac{KE_{\alpha} - KE_N - KE_n}{c^2}
   \]

3. **Calculations**:  
   - Convert masses to energy using \(1 \, \text{amu} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\):  
     \[
     m_B c^2 = 11.01280 \times 931.5 \approx 10258.385 \, \text{MeV}
     \]
     \[
     m_{\alpha} c^2 = 4.00387 \times 931.5 \approx 3729.607 \, \text{MeV}
     \]
     \[
     m_N c^2 = 14.00752 \times 931.5 \approx 13047.994 \, \text{MeV}
     \]
   - Compute the mass difference:  
     \[
     m_B + m_{\alpha} - m_N = 11.01280 + 4.00387 - 14.00752 = 1.00915 \, \text{amu}
     \]
   - Compute the kinetic energy difference:  
     \[
     KE_{\alpha} - KE_N - KE_n = 5.250 - 2.139 - 3.260 = -0.149 \, \text{MeV}
     \]
   - Convert the kinetic energy difference to mass:  
     \[
     \frac{-0.149}{931.5} \approx -0.00016 \, \text{amu}
     \]
   - Combine to find \(m_n\):  
     \[
     m_n = 1.00915 - 0.00016 \approx 1.00899 \, \text{amu}
     \]

### Final Answer:
The mass of the neutron is approximately **1.00899 amu**, which corresponds to **Option E**.

Answer: E
