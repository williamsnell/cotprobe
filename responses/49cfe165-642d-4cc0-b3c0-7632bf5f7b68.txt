<think>
Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem about a turbine. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

So, the problem says the turbine takes in air at 825K, 690 kPa, and expands it to 138 kPa and 585K. We're supposed to assume air is an ideal gas. The questions are about available energy, loss of available energy, and the isentropic exit temperature.

First, I think available energy refers to the specific energy, which for an ideal gas is the specific enthalpy, h. So part a) asks for the available energy of the air taken in, which would be the specific enthalpy at the inlet conditions.

Wait, but how do I calculate that? Oh right, the formula for specific enthalpy for an ideal gas is h = C_p * T. So I need the specific heat at constant pressure, C_p, for air. I remember that for air, C_p is approximately 1005 J/kg·K, which is 1.005 kJ/kg·K. Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check: 1005 J/kg·K is 1.005 kJ/kg·K, right? Yeah.

So the inlet temperature is 825 K. So h_in = C_p * T_in. Let me compute that: 1.005 kJ/kg·K * 825 K = ?

Let me calculate that: 1.005 * 800 is 804, and 1.005 * 25 is 25.125. So total is 804 + 25.125 = 829.125 kJ/kg. Hmm, but looking at the options, none of the a) values are around 829. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, wait—no, wait. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the units. Because 1005 J/kg·K is 1.005 kJ/kg·K. So 1.005 kJ/kg·K * 825 K = 829.125 kJ/kg.

Wait, but looking at the options, the first part (a) values are all around 250-320 kJ/kg. So maybe I did something wrong. Wait, perhaps I'm forgetting that for turbines, the specific enthalpy change is considered, but no, the available energy is the specific enthalpy at the inlet.

Wait, maybe I have the wrong C_p value. Oh wait! Wait, for air, sometimes people use 1.005 kJ/kg·K, but sometimes it's approximated as 1.004, but maybe the correct value for air is around 1.004 kJ/kg·K. Let me recalculate with that.

So 1.004 * 825 K = 825 * 1 = 825, 825 * 0.004 = 3.3, so total 828.3 kJ/kg. Still around 828, which isn't matching the options. So I must be missing something.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the available energy, which might be the specific enthalpy relative to some reference point. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the available energy is the specific work output from the turbine, but that doesn't make sense because part b) is about the loss of available energy.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the change in enthalpy, but part a) is the available energy at the inlet, which is the specific enthalpy at inlet.

Wait, maybe the problem is using R (gas constant) as 287 J/kg·K, but wait, R is for air, R = 287 J/kg·K. C_p is C_p = (γ/(γ-1)) * R. For air, γ is approximately 1.4. So C_p = (1.4 / 0.4) * 287 = 3.5 * 287 = 1004.5 J/kg·K, which is about 1.0045 kJ/kg·K. So same as before.

So 1.0045 * 825 = let's compute that: 825 * 1 = 825, 825 * 0.0045 = 3.7125, so total 828.7125 kJ/kg. Still around 828.7, which is nowhere near the options given.

Wait a minute, I think I'm getting this wrong. Because the options for part a) are around 250-320 kJ/kg, which is lower than my calculation. So maybe I'm miscalculating the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different reference point, but I can't think of any other way.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing specific enthalpy with specific energy. Or perhaps the problem is using a different value for C_p. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the enthalpy relative to 0K, which doesn't make sense. I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just proceed and see if the other parts make sense. Maybe I made a mistake in part a), but perhaps I can find the correct answer by looking at other parts.

Wait, the problem also asks for part c) the isentropic exit temperature, T_0. So for an isentropic process, entropy remains constant. Since air is treated as an ideal gas, the entropy change for an isentropic process is zero. So we can calculate the isentropic exit temperature using the relation between pressures and temperatures.

The formula for isentropic process is (T2/T1) = (P2/P1)^( (γ-1)/γ ). So let's compute that.

Given:

T1 = 825 K,

P1 = 690 kPa,

P2 = 138 kPa,

So (P2/P1) = 138 / 690 = 0.2.

So (T2/T1) = (0.2)^( (γ-1)/γ )

Assuming γ for air is 1.4, so (γ-1)/γ = 0.4/1.4 ≈ 0.2857.

So (T2/T1) = (0.2)^0.2857.

I need to compute 0.2 raised to the power of approximately 0.2857.

Let me calculate that: 0.2 is 1/5. So ln(1/5) is -ln(5) ≈ -1.6094. Multiply by 0.2857: -1.6094 * 0.2857 ≈ -0.460.

Exponentiate: e^(-0.460) ≈ 0.631. So T2 = T1 * 0.631 ≈ 825 * 0.631.

Calculating 825 * 0.6 = 495, 825 * 0.031 ≈ 25.575. So total ≈ 495 +25.575 ≈ 520.575 K.

Looking at the options, part c) is T_0, which is the isentropic exit temperature.

Looking at the options:

Option G: 520.9 K → that's close to what I calculated (520.575 ≈ 520.6). So perhaps option G's T_0 is correct.

Now, looking at option G, part a) is 305.5 kJ/kg, part b) is -60.4, and c) 520.9K.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I got part a) as around 828 kJ/kg, which isn't matching any option. So maybe I made a mistake in part a). Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong approach.

Wait, perhaps the available energy is the specific enthalpy relative to the exit state's enthalpy. So maybe the available energy is h_in - h_out, but that would be the change, not the available energy at the inlet.

Alternatively, perhaps the available energy is the specific work output, but that's usually h_in - h_out.

Wait, but in the problem, part a) is asking for the available energy of the air taken in, which would be h_in. But none of the options match that, so perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe I should calculate h_in and h_out, then find the available energy as h_in - h_out, but that would be the change in enthalpy, which is the heat transfer at constant pressure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the available energy is the specific enthalpy at the inlet, but maybe the problem is using a different reference point. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for available energy as h_in - h_out, but that's the enthalpy drop, which is the work output.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the available energy is the specific enthalpy at the inlet minus the specific enthalpy at the exit, which would be the work output. But that would be for part b), the loss.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think again.

The available energy of the air taken in (part a) would be the specific enthalpy at the inlet, h_in. So h_in = C_p * T_in.

Using C_p = 1.005 kJ/kg·K,

h_in = 1.005 * 825 = 829.125 kJ/kg.

But the options for part a) are all around 250-320, which is much lower. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using C_p in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the specific enthalpy is relative to a different reference point. Alternatively, maybe the problem is in error, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the change in enthalpy, which would be h_in - h_out, and that's the available energy, but part a) is h_in, so I'm back to the same problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating C_p. Let me check: for air, R = 287 J/kg·K, and C_p = (γ/(γ-1)) * R. γ is 1.4, so (1.4/0.4) = 3.5, so C_p = 3.5 * 287 = 1004.5 J/kg·K → 1.0045 kJ/kg·K, which is what I used before.

Hmm. So I'm stuck on part a). But given that the isentropic exit temperature for option G is 520.9K, which matches my calculation, perhaps the correct answer is G.

Now, part a) for G is 305.5 kJ/kg, which is much lower than my calculation. So perhaps I'm missing a step. Wait, maybe the available energy is not h_in, but something else.

Wait, perhaps the available energy is the specific energy, which for an ideal gas is (h - h_ref), where h_ref is the enthalpy at some reference temperature. But I'm not sure what the reference would be.

Alternatively, perhaps the available energy is the specific work, which would be h_in - h_out.

Wait, let's calculate h_out. At the exit, T_out is 585 K. So h_out = C_p * T_out = 1.0045 * 585 ≈ 587.56 kJ/kg.

So the change in enthalpy, h_in - h_out = 829.125 - 587.56 ≈ 241.565 kJ/kg. That's the specific enthalpy drop, which would be the work output if it's an ideal turbine with no losses.

But part a) is asking for the available energy of the air taken in, which I think is h_in. But none of the options match that, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the available energy is the specific enthalpy relative to the exit state's enthalpy, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the available energy is the specific work that can be extracted, which would be h_in - h_out, which is around 241.565 kJ/kg. But looking at the options, part a) is in the 250-320 range, so maybe 241.565 is close to option F's 250.5 or option C's 295.5. But 241 is closer to F's 250.5.

Wait, but F's part c) is 530.9K, which doesn't match my isentropic calculation of 520.575 K. So perhaps it's not F.

Alternatively, perhaps part a) is asking for the specific enthalpy leaving the turbine, h_out, which is 587.56 kJ/kg, but that's not matching any option either.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should proceed to part b) and see.

Part b) is the loss of available energy in the turbine. That would be the actual enthalpy drop minus the isentropic enthalpy drop. Alternatively, the loss would be the actual work output minus the isentropic work output.

Wait, the actual work output is h_in - h_out_actual, and the isentropic work output is h_in - h_out_isen. So the loss would be (h_in - h_out_isen) - (h_in - h_out_actual) ) = h_out_actual - h_out_isen.

Wait, but I think I'm getting this wrong. The loss would be the difference between the ideal work (isentropic) and the actual work. So loss = (h_in - h_out_isen) - (h_in - h_out_actual) ) = h_out_actual - h_out_isen. If this is positive, it's a loss.

Wait, but the actual exit temperature is given as 585 K. So the actual enthalpy h_out is 1.0045 * 585 ≈ 587.56 kJ/kg.

The isentropic exit temperature is about 520.58 K, so h_out_isen = 1.0045 * 520.58 ≈ 523.19 kJ/kg.

So the actual work output is h_in - h_out = 829.125 - 587.56 ≈ 241.565 kJ/kg.

The isentropic work output is h_in - h_out_isen = 829.125 - 523.19 ≈ 305.935 kJ/kg.

So the loss would be 305.935 - 241.565 ≈ 64.37 kJ/kg. But the options for part b) are all negative, which would make sense because it's a loss, so perhaps the actual work is less than isentropic, so the loss is negative.

Wait, but the loss is the actual work minus isentropic work: 241.565 - 305.935 ≈ -64.37 kJ/kg. So the loss is -64.37 kJ/kg.

Looking at the options, option G has part b) as -60.4, which is close to -64.37 but not exactly. Option C has -60.4 as part b), but its T_0 is 500.9K, which doesn't match our earlier calculation.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the isentropic exit temperature calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the isentropic exit temperature.

Using (T2/T1) = (P2/P1)^((γ-1)/γ).

P2 = 138 kPa, P1 = 690 kPa.

P2/P1 = 138/690 = 0.2.

γ = 1.4, so (γ-1)/γ = 0.4/1.4 ≈ 0.2857.

So (T2) = T1 * (0.2)^0.2857.

Calculating 0.2^0.2857:

We can compute ln(0.2) = -1.6094.

Multiply by 0.2857: -1.6094 * 0.2857 ≈ -0.460.

e^(-0.460) ≈ 0.631.

So T2 = 825 * 0.631 ≈ 520.575 K.

So h_out_isen = 1.0045 * 520.575 ≈ 523.185 kJ/kg.

So the isentropic work output is h_in - h_out_isen = 829.125 - 523.185 ≈ 305.94 kJ/kg.

The actual work output is h_in - h_out = 829.125 - 587.56 ≈ 241.565 kJ/kg.

So the loss is 241.565 - 305.94 ≈ -64.375 kJ/kg.

Looking at the options, option G has part b) as -60.4, which is close but not exact. Option C has part b) as -60.4, but its T_0 is 500.9K, which doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating h_out. Let me check.

Wait, the actual exit temperature is 585 K, so h_out = 1.0045 * 585 = let's compute precisely:

1.0045 * 585 = 1.0045 * 500 = 502.25, 1.0045 * 85 = 85.3825. So total 502.25 +85.3825 = 587.6325 kJ/kg.

So the actual work is 829.125 - 587.6325 = 241.4925 kJ/kg.

The isentropic work is 829.125 - 523.185 ≈ 305.94 kJ/kg.

So loss is 241.4925 - 305.94 ≈ -64.4475 kJ/kg.

Looking at the options, none of them have part b) as approximately -64.45. The closest is option G's -60.4, but that's not very close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me check the isentropic calculation again. Maybe I messed up the exponent.

Wait, (γ-1)/γ for γ=1.4 is 0.4/1.4 = 2/7 ≈ 0.2857. So correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different value for γ, like 1.400, but that shouldn't make a big difference.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the relation between temperatures and pressures using R and γ in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula (T2) = T1 * (P2/P1) ^ ((γ-1)/γ). So that's correct.

Hmm. Now, perhaps I should look at the options and see which one has the correct T_0 and part b) close to what I calculated.

Option G has part c) as 520.9 K, which matches our calculation. Its part b) is -60.4, which is close to our calculated -64.45 but not exact. However, perhaps rounding is involved.

Now, part a) for option G is 305.5 kJ/kg, which is the isentropic work output, not the available energy at the inlet. So perhaps part a) is the isentropic work output, which would be the available energy if the process were isentropic. But the actual available energy is lower, at 241.5 kJ/kg.

Wait, but the question says part a) is the available energy of the air taken in. That should be h_in, which I calculated as 828.7 kJ/kg, but that's not matching any option. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding what part a) is asking.

Wait, perhaps the available energy is the specific work that can be extracted, which would be the isentropic work output, which is 305.94 kJ/kg. So part a) would be 305.94, which is close to option G's 305.5.

Then part b) is the loss, which is actual work (241.5) minus isentropic work (305.94) → 241.5 - 305.94 = -64.44, which is close to option G's -60.4. Hmm, but not exact. Perhaps there's a rounding difference.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use a different approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the available energy is the specific enthalpy at the exit, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the available energy is the specific work output, which would be h_in - h_out. So part a) would be 241.5 kJ/kg, which is close to option F's 250.5, but F's T_0 is 530.9K, which doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the available energy is the enthalpy drop, but that's what I just did.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Given that option G has the correct T_0, and part a) is close to the isentropic work output, perhaps that's the intended answer.

So, putting it all together, the options would be:

a) 305.5 kJ/kg (option G),

b) -60.4 kJ/kg (option G),

c) 520.9 K (option G).

So the correct answer would be option G.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the turbine's operation under the assumption that air behaves as an ideal gas. The key steps involve calculating the specific enthalpy at the inlet, determining the isentropic exit temperature, and computing the loss of available energy.

### Part (a): Available Energy of the Air Taken In
The available energy of the air taken in corresponds to the specific enthalpy at the inlet conditions. For an ideal gas, the specific enthalpy is given by:

\[
h = C_p \cdot T
\]

Using \( C_p = 1.005 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \) and \( T_{\text{in}} = 825 \, \text{K} \):

\[
h_{\text{in}} = 1.005 \cdot 825 = 829.125 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]

However, the options provided for part (a) are significantly lower, suggesting a misunderstanding or alternative interpretation of "available energy." Upon further analysis, it appears the problem may be referring to the isentropic work output, which is the difference in enthalpy between the inlet and isentropic exit conditions. This value aligns closely with option G's value of \( 305.5 \, \text{kJ/kg} \).

### Part (b): Loss of Available Energy
The loss of available energy is calculated as the difference between the isentropic work output and the actual work output. The isentropic exit temperature is determined using the relation:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}}
\]

Given \( \gamma = 1.4 \), \( T_1 = 825 \, \text{K} \), \( P_1 = 690 \, \text{kPa} \), and \( P_2 = 138 \, \text{kPa} \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{138}{690} \approx 0.2
\]
\[
\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma} = \frac{0.4}{1.4} \approx 0.2857
\]
\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = 0.2^{0.2857} \approx 0.631
\]
\[
T_2 = 825 \cdot 0.631 \approx 520.575 \, \text{K}
\]

The isentropic work output is:

\[
h_{\text{isen}} = C_p \cdot T_2 = 1.005 \cdot 520.575 \approx 523.19 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]

The actual work output is determined using the actual exit temperature \( T_{\text{out}} = 585 \, \text{K} \):

\[
h_{\text{out}} = C_p \cdot T_{\text{out}} = 1.005 \cdot 585 \approx 587.56 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]

The loss of available energy is:

\[
\text{Loss} = (h_{\text{in}} - h_{\text{isen}}) - (h_{\text{in}} - h_{\text{out}})
\]
\[
\text{Loss} = h_{\text{out}} - h_{\text{isen}} = 587.56 - 523.19 \approx 64.37 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]

Since this represents a loss, the value is negative: \( -64.37 \, \text{kJ/kg} \). The closest option is \( -60.4 \, \text{kJ/kg} \), which matches option G.

### Part (c): Isentropic Exit Temperature
The isentropic exit temperature was calculated as \( T_2 \approx 520.575 \, \text{K} \), which corresponds closely to option G's value of \( 520.9 \, \text{K} \).

### Final Answer
Based on the calculations, the correct option is:

**G: 305.5 kJ/kg, -60.4 kJ/kg, 520.9K**

G
