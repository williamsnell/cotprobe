Question:

An investigator is studying the incidence of the common cold among medical students at various time points during the school year. Results show an increased incidence of upper respiratory tract infections among these students during finals week. It is hypothesized that the stress of studying for examinations adversely affects the immune system, making the students more susceptible to infection. Which of the following laboratory findings in these students during examination week is most likely to support this hypothesis?

Options:

A: Decreased lymphocyte count
B: Decreased basophil count
C: Decreased macrophage activity
D: Increased AM serum cortisol concentration
E: Increased macrophage activity
F: Decreased neutrophil count
G: Decreased AM serum cortisol concentration
H: Increased eosinophil count
I: Increased lymphocyte count
J: Increased basophil count

Answer:

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the immune system and stress. Let me break it down step by step.

The question says that medical students have more colds during finals week, and the hypothesis is that stress from studying for exams weakens their immune system. So, the lab finding should support that stress is making them more susceptible to infections.

I remember that stress affects the body in various ways. One major effect is on the immune system. Stress increases the production of certain hormones, like cortisol, which is released by the adrenal glands. Cortisol is a glucocorticoid hormone, and I think it has immunosuppressive effects. So when cortisol levels go up, the immune system might not work as well.

Looking at the options, D says increased AM serum cortisol concentration. That makes sense because during stress, especially in the morning (AM), cortisol levels would be higher. If cortisol is suppressing the immune system, that could explain why the students are more prone to infections.

Other options: A is decreased lymphocyte count. Lymphocytes are part of the immune system. Stress can lower white blood cell counts, including lymphocytes. So a decrease might support the hypothesis. Similarly, F is decreased neutrophil count. Neutrophils are also part of the immune system. But the question asks which finding supports the hypothesis that stress is affecting the immune system. While lower white blood cell counts would indicate a weaker immune response, the question is about the mechanism. Cortisol is a more direct measure of stress's effect on the immune system.

Options like E and I talk about increased macrophage activity. Macrophages are important for engulfing pathogens, so if they were more active, that would suggest a better immune response, which contradicts the hypothesis. So E and I are unlikely.

Options B, H, J are about basophils and eosinophils. I'm not sure about their role in stress. Basophils release histamine, but I don't recall them being directly linked to stress-induced immune suppression. Eosinophils are involved in allergic reactions and parasitic infections, so maybe not directly related here.

Option G is decreased AM cortisol. That would suggest less stress, which doesn't align with the scenario. So D seems the best fit because it directly measures higher stress hormones, which are known to suppress immunity.

So the answer should be D: Increased AM serum cortisol concentration.

The hypothesis suggests that stress during finals week increases susceptibility to infections by impairing the immune system. Stress induces the release of cortisol, a glucocorticoid with immunosuppressive effects. Increased morning serum cortisol levels directly indicate heightened stress and subsequent immune system suppression, supporting the hypothesis. Other options, such as decreased lymphocyte or neutrophil counts, also suggest immune compromise but do not directly measure the stress mechanism. Therefore, the most appropriate finding is increased AM serum cortisol concentration.

Answer: D
