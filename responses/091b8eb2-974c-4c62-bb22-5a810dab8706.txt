Okay, so I have this question about the "Flower Sermon" and which form of Buddhism it's associated with. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that the Flower Sermon is a significant event in Buddhist history. From what I've read, it's often depicted as the moment when the Buddha delivered a teaching without speaking any words. Instead, he just held up a flower, and only one of his disciples, Mahākāśyapa, understood the message. This is supposed to symbolize the transmission of the Dharma beyond words, which is a key concept in certain Buddhist schools.

Now, looking at the options given: A is Nichiren, B is Jodo Shinshu, C is Theravada, D is Chan-Zen, E is Pure Land, F is Tibetan, G is Shingon, H is Vajrayana, I is Yogicara, and J is Tendai.

I think the Flower Sermon is closely associated with Chan Buddhism, which is the Chinese version, known as Zen in Japan. Chan and Zen emphasize direct intuition and insight, which aligns with the idea of a teaching beyond words. So, the Flower Sermon would be linked to the Chan-Zen tradition.

Wait, but let me make sure. I recall that the story of the Flower Sermon is particularly important in the lineage of the First Patriarch of Chan, Mahākāśyapa. So yes, that points to Chan-Zen as the correct association.

Looking at the options again, D is Chan-Zen. So that should be the answer.

The "Flower Sermon" is a pivotal moment in Buddhist history where the Buddha communicated through silence and a flower, symbolizing the transmission of the Dharma beyond words. This event is central to the Chan (Zen) tradition, particularly emphasizing direct intuition and insight. Therefore, the correct answer is D.

Answer: D
