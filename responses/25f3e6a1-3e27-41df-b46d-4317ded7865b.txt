Okay, so I've got this question about neurons and their parts. The question is asking which part directs the synthesis of neurotransmitters and proteins. Hmm, I remember that neurons have different parts, each with specific functions. Let me think through this.

First, let me recall the structure of a neuron. There's the cell body, which is also called the soma. The cell body contains the nucleus and other important organelles like the mitochondria and the Golgi apparatus. Oh wait, the Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying and sorting proteins, so maybe that's relevant here.

Then there are dendrites, which are the tree-like branches coming out of the cell body. They receive signals from other neurons. The axon is the long fiber that sends signals away from the cell body. The axon terminal is at the end of the axon, and that's where neurotransmitters are stored in synaptic vesicles. Synaptic cleft is the tiny gap between neurons where neurotransmitters are released.

Wait, the question is about where these neurotransmitters and proteins are synthesized. So where does synthesis happen? Proteins are made in the ribosomes, which are in the cell body, right? The cell body is where most of the protein synthesis occurs because that's where the nucleus is, and the nucleus controls the production of mRNA, which is used by ribosomes to make proteins.

As for neurotransmitters, I think they can be synthesized in different parts depending on the neuron. Some are made in the cell body and then transported to the axon terminals. Others might be synthesized in the terminals themselves. But generally, the cell body is responsible for directing the synthesis because it's where the genetic instructions are stored and transcribed.

Looking at the options, option G is the cell body. That makes sense because the cell body houses the nucleus, which directs the synthesis of proteins through gene expression. The axon terminals (option A) store and release neurotransmitters but don't direct their synthesis. The axon itself (option B) is more about conducting signals. The synaptic cleft (C) is just the space between neurons. Neuroglia (D) are support cells, not the neuron itself. Myelin sheath (E) and Schwann cells (F) are related to insulation and protection. Axon hillock (H) is where the action potential starts. Nodes of Ranvier (I) are gaps in the myelin sheath. Dendrites (J) receive signals.

So putting it all together, the cell body (G) is the part that directs the synthesis of neurotransmitters and proteins.

The part of the neuron responsible for directing the synthesis of neurotransmitters and proteins is the cell body, as it contains the nucleus and organelles necessary for these processes.

Answer: G
