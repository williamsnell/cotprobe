Okay, so I need to figure out which sport is featured in the 1996 movie 'Kingpin'. I'm not super familiar with the movie, but I think it's a comedy. Let me try to remember what I know about it.

I recall that the main characters are played by Tom Sizemore and Mike Judge, who also created 'Kingpin'. The movie is about a group of friends who are into bowling. I think the plot revolves around them trying to start a new bowling league or something like that. They might have been trying to get a bowling alley, and then the story probably involves some competition or challenges related to bowling. 

Looking at the options, I see bowling is option F. Other sports like baseball (C) or wrestling (D) might be more common in movies, but I'm pretty sure this one is about bowling. I don't remember any scenes involving other sports like ice hockey or basketball. It was definitely focused on bowling as the central activity.

So, putting it all together, the answer should be F: bowling.
