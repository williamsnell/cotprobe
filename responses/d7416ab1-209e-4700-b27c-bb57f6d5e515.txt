Question:

What roles does glucose play in cellmetabolism ?

Options:

A: Glucose is used to create cell membranes and is not involved in energy storage
B: Glucose is converted directly into nucleic acids for cell replication
C: Glucose serves only as a secondary energy source when fats and proteins are not available
D: Glucose cannot be stored in cells
E: Glucose is the primary source of energy for plant cells, but not for animal cells
F: Glucose serves as the primary source of energy for all cells, can be converted to glycogen for storage, and can be converted into fat for later use.
G: Glucose can only be converted into protein for cell structure
H: Glucose is only stored in the form of fat
I: Glucose is only used for energy production
J: Glucose is exclusively used to synthesize amino acids and proteins

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this question about the roles of glucose in cell metabolism. The question is a multiple-choice one with options A through J. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I remember that glucose is a carbohydrate and a key player in energy production. I think it's a primary energy source for cells, especially in animals. But I'm not entirely sure about all the details, so I'll go through each option one by one.

Option A says glucose is used to create cell membranes and isn't involved in energy storage. Wait, cell membranes are made from lipids, not glucose. So I don't think A is correct because glucose isn't a structural component of cell membranes. Plus, I know glucose is definitely involved in energy storage, like in glycogen.

Option B states that glucose is converted directly into nucleic acids for cell replication. Hmm, nucleic acids are made from various building blocks, like amino acids and other precursors, not directly from glucose. So I don't think B is right either.

Option C claims glucose is only a secondary energy source when fats and proteins aren't available. That doesn't sound right because I remember that glucose is the primary energy source, especially in the brain and other high-energy-demand tissues. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D says glucose can't be stored in cells. But wait, in the liver and muscles, glucose is stored as glycogen. So D is wrong because glucose is stored, at least in those cells.

Option E states that glucose is the primary energy source for plant cells but not for animals. That doesn't make sense because both plants and animals use glucose as their main energy source. Plants make it through photosynthesis, and animals get it from their diet or breakdown of glycogen. So E is incorrect.

Option F says glucose is the primary energy source for all cells, can be converted to glycogen for storage, and can be converted into fat for later use. This sounds familiar. I know glucose is the main energy molecule. When there's excess glucose, the body stores it as glycogen in the liver and muscles, and if there's even more, it can be converted into fat for storage. So F seems correct so far.

Option G claims glucose can only be converted into protein. No, glucose doesn't directly convert into proteins. Proteins are made from amino acids, which have their own sources. So G is wrong.

Option H says glucose is only stored as fat. That's not true because, as I thought earlier, it's stored as glycogen too. So H is incorrect.

Option I states glucose is only used for energy production. While that's a major role, I think glucose can also be used in building other molecules. For example, it can be converted into other sugars, or into glycogen, or even into lipids. So I is too restrictive and probably not correct.

Option J says glucose is exclusively used to synthesize amino acids and proteins. That's not right because amino acids are made from other sources, and glucose is mainly for energy, not protein synthesis. So J is incorrect.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be F because it accurately describes glucose's role as the primary energy source, its storage as glycogen, and its conversion into fat when needed.

The correct answer is F: Glucose serves as the primary source of energy for all cells, can be converted to glycogen for storage, and can be converted into fat for later use.
