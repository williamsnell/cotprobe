Okay, so I've got this question about what happens to the mass number when an element ejects an alpha particle. Hmm, I remember that alpha particles are involved in radioactive decay, specifically alpha decay. But wait, what exactly is an alpha particle made of?

I think alpha particles are helium nuclei. Right, so each alpha particle has two protons and two neutrons. So the composition is 2 protons and 2 neutrons, which makes a mass number of 4 because protons and neutrons are counted together for mass number.

Now, when an element ejects an alpha particle, it loses some mass number. So the original element has a certain mass number, and after emitting an alpha, it becomes a new element with a lower mass number. I should subtract the mass of the alpha particle from the original element's mass number.

Let me think about the process. The original nucleus loses two protons and two neutrons. Since the mass number is the total number of protons plus neutrons, subtracting 4 (because 2+2) should give the new mass number. So if the original element has a mass number A, after alpha decay, the new one would be A-4.

Wait, let me think about an example. Like uranium-238 decays into thorium-234 by alpha emission. Uranium-238 has 238 mass number, and after losing 4, it becomes 234. So yes, the mass number reduces by 4.

Looking back at the options, the question asks what happens to the mass number. So the correct change is a reduction by 4. Let me check the options again.

Options are from A to J. Option F is "reduces by 4." That must be the correct answer.

When an element ejects an alpha particle, it loses two protons and two neutrons, resulting in a decrease of the mass number by 4. 

Answer: F
