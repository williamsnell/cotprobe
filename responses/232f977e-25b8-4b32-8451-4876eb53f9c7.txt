Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator in thermal equilibrium. Hmm, I need to find the average total energy. Let me think about what I remember from my studies.

Wait, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system that experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement. In one dimension, the energy levels are quantized. But this is three-dimensional, so maybe each direction contributes to the total energy.

Oh right, in three dimensions, you can think of it as three independent one-dimensional oscillators, one along each axis (x, y, z). So the total energy would be the sum of the energies in each direction.

What's the average energy for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator at thermal equilibrium? I think it's related to the temperature and the Boltzmann constant. Oh wait, for a single mode, the average energy is (1/2) ħω, but that's in the ground state. But when considering thermal equilibrium, especially using the equipartition theorem, each degree of freedom contributes (1/2) kT to the energy.

Wait, the equipartition theorem says that each quadratic degree of freedom contributes (1/2)kT on average. For a harmonic oscillator in each dimension, the potential and kinetic energy each contribute a quadratic term. So each dimension gives (1/2)kT + (1/2)kT = kT. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me clarify.

In the case of a classical harmonic oscillator, the average energy per degree of freedom is (1/2)kT for each quadratic term. Since a 1D oscillator has two quadratic terms (kinetic and potential), each contributes (1/2)kT, so total of kT per dimension.

Wait, but wait, in quantum mechanics, especially at absolute zero, the ground state energy is (1/2)ħω for each dimension. But when the temperature is involved, especially in the high-temperature limit where thermal energy kT is much larger than ħω, the oscillator behaves classically, and the equipartition theorem applies. So each degree of freedom contributes (1/2)kT.

So for three dimensions, each dimension contributes (1/2)kT * 2 = kT? No, wait. Each quadratic term in the Hamiltonian contributes (1/2)kT. For a 3D oscillator, how many degrees of freedom are there?

Each direction (x, y, z) contributes two quadratic terms: kinetic (like (p_x)^2) and potential (like (x)^2). So each dimension has two, so in 3D, there are 6 quadratic terms. But wait, that can't be right because each direction would have kinetic and potential, so 2 per dimension, times 3 dimensions is 6. But each quadratic term contributes (1/2)kT, so total energy would be 6*(1/2)kT = 3kT.

Wait, but wait—no, that's not right. Each degree of freedom is a pair of coordinates and their conjugate momenta. So for 3D, there are 3 positions and 3 momenta, making 6 degrees of freedom. Each contributes (1/2)kT, so total average energy is (6/2)kT = 3kT.

But I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The three-dimensional oscillator can be treated as three independent 1D oscillators. Each 1D has average energy of (1/2)kT (ground state) plus thermal contributions. Wait no, I'm getting mixed between zero-point energy and thermal contributions.

Alternatively, in the classical case, each quadratic term gives (1/2)kT. So for each dimension, you have kinetic (p²/(2m)) and potential (1/2 m ω² x²), each contributing (1/2)kT. So per dimension, the average energy is (1/2 + 1/2) kT = kT. For three dimensions, it's 3kT.

Wait, but wait, I thought the equipartition theorem says that each quadratic term gives (1/2)kT. So in 3D, the oscillator has 3 positions and 3 momenta, 6 terms, so total energy would be 6*(1/2)kT = 3kT. That matches the previous calculation.

So looking back at the options, option E is 3kT. So the answer should be E.

The average total energy of a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator in thermal equilibrium at temperature \( T \) can be determined using the equipartition theorem. For each degree of freedom, the average energy contribution is \( \frac{1}{2}kT \). A three-dimensional harmonic oscillator has 3 positions and 3 momenta, corresponding to 6 degrees of freedom. Each quadratic term in the Hamiltonian contributes \( \frac{1}{2}kT \), so the total average energy is:

\[
6 \times \frac{1}{2}kT = 3kT
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: E**
