Question:

A teachers union, a nongovernmental entity, seeks to picket the local city school board for its decision to require higher certification for instructors who wish to teach in the gifted and talented classes in elementary school. After a few days of picketing, the school board seeks a temporary injunction in the state court to restrain further picketing of the school board. The school board insists that the teachers union has violated Section 101 of the city's picketing ordinance. Section 101 reads as follows:"Section 101. No picketing shall be permitted inside of, or on any sidewalk or street immediately adjacent or contiguous to public elementary and secondary schools without express permission of the mayor. Applications for such permission shall be filed at least three days before such picketing is intended to begin and shall state the purpose, place, and time of the proposed picketing. "The court will most likely

Options:

A: deny relief, because the ordinance does not clearly define what constitutes as "immediately adjacent or contiguous."
B: deny relief, because the teachers union has the right to peaceful protest.
C: deny relief, because the picketing ordinancewas unconstitutional on its face.
D: grant relief, because the ordinance isconstitutional.
E: grant relief, because the ordinance is necessary for the maintenance of peace and order around schools.
F: grant relief, because the picketing disrupted the operation of the school.
G: deny relief, because the ordinance does notprovide procedural due process.
H: deny relief, because the ordinance infringes on the union's right to freedom of speech.
I: grant relief, because the teachers union did not receive permission from the mayor.

Okay, so I have this legal question about a teachers union picketing and whether a temporary injunction should be granted. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the scenario is that a teachers union, which is a non-governmental entity, is picketing the local city school board. They're protesting the decision to require higher certification for instructors in gifted and talented classes. After a few days, the school board goes to state court for a temporary injunction to stop the picketing, claiming the union violated Section 101 of the city's picketing ordinance.

Looking at Section 101, it says no picketing is allowed inside or on any sidewalk or street immediately adjacent or contiguous to public schools without the mayor's permission. Applications must be filed at least three days before, stating the purpose, place, and time.

The question is, what will the court most likely do? The options are from A to I.

I need to figure out if the ordinance is constitutional and whether the court will grant the injunction or not. Let's think about the First Amendment implications here. Picketing is a form of protest, which is protected speech. But the government can impose reasonable restrictions, especially in public spaces and near schools.

Section 101 requires a permit three days in advance, which is a prior restraint. The Supreme Court has held that prior restraints on speech are generally unconstitutional unless they meet strict scrutiny. But in cases involving public spaces, especially near schools, the government might have a compelling interest, like maintaining order and preventing disruption.

Wait, but in this case, the picketing is on the sidewalk or street adjacent to the schools. The question is whether the ordinance is constitutional. If the ordinance is constitutional, then the court would likely grant the injunction because the union violated it by not obtaining permission.

Option I says grant relief because the union didn't get permission. That seems straightforward, but is the ordinance constitutional? The First Amendment allows time, place, and manner restrictions if they're content-neutral, narrowly tailored, and leave ample alternative channels of communication.

Section 101's restriction is based on locationâ€”immediately adjacent to schools. It doesn't prohibit picketing elsewhere, so it's content-neutral. The requirement for a permit three days in advance might be a prior restraint, but it's not necessarily unconstitutional if it's a reasonable regulation. The Supreme Court has upheld similar regulations near schools to prevent disruptions.

So, if the ordinance is constitutional, then the union's failure to get permission would mean the injunction is granted. Looking at the options, option I says "grant relief because the teachers union did not receive permission from the mayor." That makes sense if the ordinance is valid.

But wait, what about other options? Option H says deny relief because the ordinance infringes on free speech. If the court finds the ordinance unconstitutional, then they'd deny the injunction. But I think the court would likely uphold the ordinance because it's a reasonable time, place, and manner restriction.

Option E says grant relief because the ordinance is necessary for peace and order. That sounds plausible too, but I think the key is whether the ordinance is constitutional. If it is, then the injunction would be granted because the union violated it.

Option C says deny relief because the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face. But I don't think that's the case here. The ordinance doesn't seem to be a content-based restriction. It's location-based, which is allowed.

So, putting it all together, the court is likely to grant the injunction because the union didn't get the required permission, and the ordinance is constitutional. Therefore, the answer should be I.

The court is likely to grant the injunction because the teachers union did not obtain the required permission under the city's picketing ordinance, which is constitutional as it imposes a reasonable time, place, and manner restriction. 

Answer: I
