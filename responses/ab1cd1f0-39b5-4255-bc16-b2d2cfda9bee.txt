Okay, so I have this logic problem here, and I'm trying to figure out which proposition is an immediate consequence of the given premises. Let me break it down step by step.

The premises given are:
1. A ⊃ (B • C)
2. ~(B • C)
3. A ∨ (D ∨ B)

And the options are from A to J, each representing a different proposition. I need to determine which one is an immediate consequence, meaning it can be derived in one step from the premises.

First, let me recall some basic logical rules and implications. An implication A ⊃ (B • C) can be read as "If A, then both B and C." The second premise is the negation of (B • C), which is ~(B • C), meaning it's not the case that both B and C are true. The third premise is a disjunction: A ∨ (D ∨ B), which can be simplified using the associative property of disjunction to A ∨ D ∨ B.

Now, looking at the first premise, A ⊃ (B • C). In classical logic, if we have an implication and its consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false. This is known as modus tollens. So, if ~(B • C) is true, then A must be false. That suggests that from premises 1 and 2, we can conclude ~A.

Let me check that again. If A implies (B • C), and we know that (B • C) is false, then A cannot be true. So yes, ~A follows directly from premises 1 and 2. That would make option C the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something else. The third premise is A ∨ D ∨ B. If we have ~A from premises 1 and 2, then in the third premise, since A is false, the disjunction simplifies to D ∨ B, meaning either D or B must be true. But that's not directly one of the options except for option B, which is D ∨ B. However, that's a conclusion that comes after knowing ~A, not an immediate consequence of the premises on their own.

So, looking back, the immediate consequence comes from premises 1 and 2 leading directly to ~A, which is option C. The third premise isn't needed for this immediate step because ~A can be derived without considering the third premise. The third premise would be relevant if we were trying to derive something else, like D or B, but since the question is about an immediate consequence, it's just the first two premises that matter here.

I think I'm confident that the answer is C: ~A.

The immediate consequence is derived from premises 1 and 2 using modus tollens, leading to ~A.

Answer: C
