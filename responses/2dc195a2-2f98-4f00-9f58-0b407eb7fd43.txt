Question:

A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician because of easy bruising for 4 months. She has a history of lung cancer treated with radiation therapy 6 months ago. She has a 2-year history of hypertension treated with a thiazide diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Examination, including neurologic examination, shows no abnormalities except for multiple ecchymoses. Her hemoglobin concentration is 13 g/dL, leukocyte count is 5000/mm3 , and platelet count is 35,000/mm3 . A serum antiplatelet antibody assay is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?

Options:

A: CT scan of the abdomen
B: CT scan of the chest
C: Bronchoscopy
D: Bone marrow aspiration

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's start by reading through the question carefully.

The patient is a 67-year-old woman who comes in because of easy bruising for four months. Her medical history includes lung cancer treated with radiation therapy six months ago. She also has hypertension treated with a thiazide diuretic and an ACE inhibitor. On examination, she has multiple ecchymoses, but no other abnormalities. Her lab results show hemoglobin at 13 g/dL, leukocyte count of 5000/mm³, and platelet count of 35,000/mm³. The serum antiplatelet antibody assay is negative.

The question is asking for the most appropriate next step in diagnosis. The options are A through D: CT abdomen, CT chest, bronchoscopy, or bone marrow aspiration.

First, I need to think about the presenting symptoms and possible causes. Easy bruising for four months suggests a bleeding disorder, likely related to platelets since her platelet count is low (35,000 is below normal, which is usually around 150,000-450,000/mm³). She has a history of lung cancer and radiation therapy. Radiation can sometimes cause bone marrow suppression, leading to thrombocytopenia, which would explain her low platelets. But why is she having easy bruising despite that?

Her antiplatelet antibody assay is negative, so it's not an immune-mediated condition like idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), as that would typically show positive antibodies. So, what else could cause thrombocytopenia? It could be due to bone marrow failure, such as aplastic anemia or myelodysplasia, or it might be a side effect of chemotherapy or radiation. Since she had radiation therapy for lung cancer, maybe that's contributing to her low platelets.

Looking at the options, CT scans of abdomen or chest would look for other issues like metastasis or organ enlargement, but her main issue seems to be related to her blood counts. Bronchoscopy is for checking the lungs, perhaps for recurrent cancer, but her platelet count is the main concern here.

Bone marrow aspiration is a direct way to assess the bone marrow function. It can help diagnose conditions like aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or leukemia, which would explain her low platelets and other cytopenias. Given her history of radiation, it's a possibility that her bone marrow is affected.

Alternatively, could she have another cause? Let's think. Her platelet count is low, but her white count is normal. No signs of infection. No other symptoms like fatigue beyond what's expected from her cancer. The antiplatelet antibodies are negative, so it's not ITP.

So the next step would be to evaluate the bone marrow. A bone marrow aspiration and biopsy could provide definitive diagnosis. It would show if there's bone marrow suppression, aplasia, or another disorder.

The other options: CT abdomen might look for liver or spleen issues, but her symptoms don't point to that. CT chest for possible recurrence of lung cancer, but she already had radiation, and her symptoms are more about bleeding. Bronchoscopy is more invasive and not directly related to her current bleeding issue.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step is a bone marrow aspiration.

The patient presents with easy bruising and a low platelet count, which raises suspicion of a bleeding disorder or bone marrow dysfunction. Given her history of lung cancer and radiation therapy, bone marrow suppression is a plausible cause. A bone marrow aspiration would provide critical information about marrow function and help diagnose conditions like aplastic anemia or myelodysplasia. 

Answer: D
