Okay, so I've got this logic problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about symbolizing a sentence in propositional logic (PL) using the given options. Let's break it down.

The sentence is: "Either England's importing beef is not a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture, or China promotes human rights if South Africa supplies diamonds."

Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me parse it into two parts connected by "or." So, the first part is about England's importing beef not being a necessary condition for France's subsidies. The second part is a conditional statement about China and South Africa.

First, I need to understand what each part means in logical terms.

Starting with the first part: "England's importing beef is not a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture." In logic, if A is a necessary condition for B, it translates to B → A. So, if E (England imports beef) is a necessary condition for F (France subsidizes agriculture), it's F → E. But the sentence says it's NOT a necessary condition, so that would be the negation of F → E. The negation of an implication (A → B) is equivalent to A ∧ ~B. So, ¬(F → E) is equivalent to F ∧ ~E. Alternatively, another way to express "A is not a necessary condition for B" is ~ (B → A), which is the same as B ∧ ~A. So, here, the first part is ~ (F → E), which is the same as F ∧ ~E. But looking at the options, I don't see any that directly express F ∧ ~E. Instead, the options use implications or their negations.

Wait, another approach: "E is not a necessary condition for F" means that F does not imply E. So, F does not necessarily lead to E. So, in logical terms, that would be ¬(F → E). Now, how is that represented in the options? Let's see the options again.

Looking at the options, I see that some start with ~ (F → E), like option B and H. So, the first part of the sentence is ¬(F → E), which is ~ (F → E).

Now, the second part of the sentence is "China promotes human rights if South Africa supplies diamonds." Let's denote C as China promotes human rights and S as South Africa supplies diamonds. So, the second part is S → C. Because if S then C.

Putting it all together, the entire sentence is: (¬(F → E)) ∨ (S → C). So, the first part is the negation of F implies E, and the second part is S implies C. Now, I need to find which option matches this structure.

Looking at the options:

A: (E ⊃ ~F) ∨ (S ≡ C) → Doesn't seem right. The first part is E implies not F, which is different from negating F→E. The second part is S equivalent to C, which isn't what we have.

B: ~(F ⊃ E) ∨ (S ⊃ C) → This looks exactly like what we have. The first part is ¬(F → E), and the second part is S → C. So this matches.

C: ~(F ⊃ E) ∨ (C ⊃ ~S) → The second part is C implies not S, which is the converse of what we need. We have S → C, but this is C → ~S, which is different.

D: (~E ⊃ F) ∨ (S ⊃ C) → The first part is ~E implies F, which is equivalent to F → E (contrapositive). But we need ¬(F → E), which would be F ∧ ~E, so this doesn't fit. The second part is correct, but the first part is incorrect.

E: (~F ⊃ E) ∨ (C ≡ ~S) → First part is ~F implies E, which is E → F (contrapositive), not the negation we need. Second part is C equivalent to ~S, which is not S → C.

F: (~F ⊃ E) ∨ (C ≡ S) → Same issue as E. First part is ~F → E, which is E → F. Second part is C equivalent to S, which is different from S → C.

G: (F ⊃ E) ∨ (~C ⊃ S) → First part is F → E, which is the opposite of what we need (we need ¬(F→E)). Second part is ~C → S, which is the same as S → C, but the first part is wrong.

H: ~(F ⊃ ~E) ∨ (S ⊃ C) → First part is the negation of F implies ~E. Wait, F implies ~E is F → ~E. The negation of that is ~(F → ~E), which is equivalent to F ∧ ~E. But our first part is ¬(F → E), which is different. So this isn't the same.

I: (~E ⊃ F) ∨ (C ⊃ S) → First part is ~E → F, which is F → E (contrapositive). So again, it's F → E, which is not what we need. The second part is C → S, which is not S → C, so that's different.

J: (E ⊃ F) ∨ (C ⊃ S) → Both parts are implications in the wrong direction. We need ¬(F→E) and S→C. So this isn't matching.

So, going through the options, option B is the only one that matches both parts correctly: ~(F ⊃ E) ∨ (S ⊃ C). Therefore, the answer should be B.

The correct symbolization is option B: ~(F ⊃ E) ∨ (S ⊃ C).

Answer: B
