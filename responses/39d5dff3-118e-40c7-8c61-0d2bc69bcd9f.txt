Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about pure capitalism and the government's role in the economy. Let me break it down step by step. 

First, I know that capitalism is an economic system where the means of production are privately owned, and the allocation of resources is determined by the free market. Pure capitalism, as I understand it, is the most extreme form where the government's involvement is minimal. 

The question is asking whether the government plays a major role under a pure capitalist system. I remember from my studies that in pure capitalism, the government's role is very limited. The main functions are usually enforcing contracts, protecting property rights, and ensuring that the legal framework supports the free market. 

Looking at the options:

A: Government intervenes only during economic crises. Hmm, that's more like a mixed economy where the government steps in when there's a problem, but pure capitalism doesn't rely on the government to step in except perhaps naturally through the legal system.

B: Government plays a minor role by enforcing contracts and property rights. This sounds right because in pure capitalism, the government doesn't interfere beyond the basics needed for the market to function smoothly.

C: No government intervention. Wait, but even in pure capitalism, there's some role for the government in enforcing laws and contracts. So C might be too extreme because it says no intervention at all, which might not be the case.

D: Provides public goods but doesn't control private enterprise. That's true, but does it mean the government is playing a major role? Probably not; it's more about providing what the market can't, which is a minor role in the overall economy.

E: Limited intervention in defense and public safety. That's also a part of the government's role, but again, it's a minor role, not major.

F: Sets minimum wage and workplace safety. This would be more of a mixed economy, as pure capitalism doesn't usually have such regulations.

G: Controls all aspects. That's socialism or command economy, not capitalism.

H: Regulates certain industries but doesn't control the economy. Again, this is more than pure capitalism allows, so H isn't correct.

I: Sets prices for all goods. That's price controls, which isn't part of pure capitalism.

J: Owns all businesses. That's socialism, not capitalism.

So, the correct answer should be B because in pure capitalism, the government's role is minimal, mainly enforcing contracts and property rights to maintain the free market without major interference.

Under a pure capitalist system, the government's role is minimal, primarily focusing on enforcing contracts and protecting property rights to facilitate a free market. This aligns with option B. 

Answer: B
