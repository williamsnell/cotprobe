Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Matt's demand curve for bratwurst. The question says that Matt's total utility from consuming bratwurst increases at a constant rate, no matter how many he eats. Hmm, I remember from my economics class that total utility and marginal utility are related. Marginal utility is the additional satisfaction from consuming one more unit.

Wait, if the total utility increases at a constant rate, that means the marginal utility is constant, right? Because each additional bratwurst gives the same extra satisfaction. Normally, I think marginal utility tends to decrease as you consume more of a good because of diminishing marginal utility. But in this case, it's constant.

Now, what does that mean for the demand curve? The demand curve shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded. If marginal utility is constant, how does that affect the demand?

I recall that the demand curve is derived from the marginal utility curve. When marginal utility decreases as quantity increases (which is the usual case), the demand curve slopes downward because as price increases, the quantity demanded decreases. But here, marginal utility isn't decreasing; it's constant.

Wait, but if marginal utility is constant, how does the price affect the quantity demanded? Let me think. The value Matt places on each additional bratwurst is the same, so he's willing to pay the same price for each one. So, if the price changes, he would adjust the quantity based on that.

Wait, no, maybe not. If his marginal utility is constant, then his willingness to pay for each bratwurst doesn't change with the number he consumes. So, his demand curve would reflect that he's willing to buy any quantity at a certain price, but I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, I think about the demand function. Normally, when marginal utility decreases, the demand curve slopes downward because each additional unit is valued less. But if marginal utility is constant, the demand curve might be a different shape.

Wait, maybe the demand curve is horizontal. Because if marginal utility is constant, the consumer is willing to buy any quantity at a fixed price. So, if the price changes, the quantity demanded would adjust accordingly. But I'm not entirely sure.

Another angle: The demand curve is derived from the marginal utility curve. If marginal utility is constant, that would mean the marginal utility curve is a horizontal line. The demand curve is the inverse of the marginal utility curve. So, if marginal utility is constant, the demand curve would be a vertical line. Because for every price, the quantity demanded is the same. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The demand curve is based on the marginal utility and price. The formula is P = MU, where MU is marginal utility. If MU is constant, say MU = c, then P = c. That would mean that the price is fixed, and the quantity demanded can be anything as long as the price is c. So, on a graph with price on the y-axis and quantity on the x-axis, the demand curve would be a horizontal line at P = c. Because Matt is willing to buy any amount at that price.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when MU is constant, the consumer's demand isn't dependent on the price in the same way. Wait, maybe the demand curve would be vertical because if the price goes up, he doesn't change his quantity because each unit gives the same utility. No, that can't be right because the price affects how much he's willing to buy.

Alternatively, if the marginal utility is constant, the consumer's willingness to pay for each unit is the same. So, the demand curve would be a straight line, but how?

Wait, let me think of the demand function. The standard demand function comes from the MU = P. If MU is constant, then P is constant. So, if the price is higher than that, he won't buy any. If it's equal, he'll buy as much as he wants. But that's not quite how demand curves work; they show the quantity demanded at each price.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to visualize. If each bratwurst gives the same marginal utility, then the consumer's willingness to pay for each is the same. So, the demand curve would be a horizontal line, meaning that at a certain price, he'll buy any quantity. But that's not possible because in reality, demand curves can't be horizontal like that; they usually slope downward.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me think about the shape of the demand curve when marginal utility is constant. If MU is constant, then the marginal utility per unit doesn't decrease with more consumption. So, the consumer's valuation doesn't decrease as they buy more. That would mean that the consumer is willing to buy more at the same price because each unit is equally valuable.

Wait, but the demand curve shows how much someone is willing to buy at different prices. If each additional unit provides the same utility, then the consumer's price elasticity would be zero, meaning the quantity demanded doesn't change with price. But that would imply a vertical demand curve, which is not typical.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to recall. Normally, if MU decreases, the demand curve slopes downward. If MU is constant, then the demand curve would be... perhaps a vertical line. Because at any price, the quantity demanded is the same. No, that doesn't make sense because if the price increases, you should buy less.

Wait, no. If marginal utility is constant, the consumer is willing to buy as much as possible at a fixed price. So, if the price is below the MU, they buy more. If the price is higher, they buy less. Wait, but how does that translate into the shape of the demand curve?

Alternatively, perhaps the demand curve would be a straight line with a negative slope, but that's the usual case. So, maybe I'm wrong earlier.

Wait, maybe the demand curve would be horizontal because the consumer is willing to buy any quantity at a certain price. But that's not how demand curves are typically drawn. Normally, demand curves slope downward because as price increases, quantity demanded decreases.

Wait, let me think again. If the marginal utility is constant, then the consumer's willingness to pay for each additional unit is the same. So, the consumer would buy as much as they can at that price. So, the demand curve would be a step function, but that's more in perfect competition.

Alternatively, perhaps the demand curve is a straight line (linear) sloping downward, but that's the standard case. So, if the marginal utility is constant, the demand curve would still slope downward because as price increases, the quantity demanded decreases.

Wait, no, because in the standard case, the demand curve slopes downward because of diminishing marginal utility. If marginal utility is constant, the demand curve would still slope downward, but at a constant rate. So, it would be a straight line (linear) downward slope.

Wait, but the options don't have a downward sloping linear option except G: Downward sloping. But the options include C: Horizontal.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think differently. The question is about Matt's demand curve. If total utility increases at a constant rate, marginal utility is constant. So, the marginal utility of the nth bratwurst is the same as the first.

In such a case, the consumer's demand curve would be a straight line, because the marginal utility is constant. So, the demand curve would be a straight line (linear) sloping downward because as price increases, quantity demanded decreases. So, the demand curve would be a straight line with a negative slope.

Wait, but the options given are A: Linearly increasing, B: Inverted U, C: Horizontal, D: Upward sloping, E: Vertical, F: Zigzag, G: Downward sloping, H: Exponentially increasing, I: Parabolic, J: U-shaped.

So, if the demand curve is linear and downward sloping, the answer would be G: Downward sloping. But wait, some sources say that if marginal utility is constant, the demand curve is a straight line, which would be G.

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the concepts. Another approach: The demand curve is derived from the marginal utility curve. If the marginal utility is a horizontal line (constant), then the demand curve would be a vertical line. Because if you invert the axes, price on y and quantity on x, a horizontal MU curve becomes a vertical demand curve.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because the MU = P implies that for each quantity, the price is the same. So, the demand curve would be vertical, meaning that Matt is willing to buy any quantity at a specific price, but if the price changes, he doesn't buy any.

But that doesn't seem right because in reality, if the price is higher, he would buy less. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the relationship between MU and the demand curve.

Wait, maybe I should think about the individual's demand function. The demand function is Q = f(P), derived from MU = P. If MU is constant, then P is constant, so Q would be any quantity as long as P is equal to that constant. So, the demand curve would be a vertical line at that price, meaning that at that price, quantity demanded is any, but that's not possible because quantity can't be any on a demand curve.

Alternatively, perhaps the demand curve is horizontal. Because if MU is constant, the consumer is willing to buy any quantity at a fixed price. So, on a graph, the demand curve would be a horizontal line at that price, but that's not standard.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it in terms of elasticity. If marginal utility is constant, the price elasticity of demand would be zero, meaning that quantity demanded doesn't change with price. So, the demand curve would be vertical, because quantity doesn't change regardless of price.

But that doesn't make sense because if the price increases, people usually buy less.

Wait, no, if elasticity is zero, it means demand is perfectly inelastic, so quantity demanded is the same regardless of price. So, the demand curve would be a vertical line. So, the answer would be E: Vertical.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again. If marginal utility is constant, then the consumer's willingness to pay for each unit is the same. So, if the price is lower than that willingness, they buy more. If the price is higher, they buy less. But if the marginal utility is constant, their willingness to pay for each additional unit is the same.

Wait, perhaps the demand curve would be a straight line sloping downward, but that's the usual case. So, maybe the answer is G: Downward sloping.

Alternatively, I'm getting confused. Let me try to find some notes. Oh wait, I can't look things up, but I'll try to recall.

In the case where marginal utility is constant, the demand curve is a straight line, which would be linearly decreasing. So, it's a straight line sloping downward. So, the answer would be G: Downward sloping.

But wait, another thought: If marginal utility is constant, the total utility increases linearly. That means the consumer's marginal benefit doesn't decrease, so the demand curve would be a straight line (linear) sloping downward. So, the demand curve would be linearly decreasing, which is a straight line sloping downward.

Looking at the options, G is Downward sloping. So, the answer is G.
</think>

If Matt's total utility from consuming bratwurst increases at a constant rate, his marginal utility is also constant. The demand curve is derived from the relationship between price and quantity demanded, where price equals marginal utility. Since marginal utility is constant, the demand curve would reflect a linear relationship, sloping downward as price decreases and quantity demanded increases. This results in a demand curve that is linearly decreasing, which corresponds to a downward sloping line.

Answer: G
