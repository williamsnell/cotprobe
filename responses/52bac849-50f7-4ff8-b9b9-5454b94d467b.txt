Okay, so I need to figure out the unit cost of each lemon in the bag. The problem says a grocerystore sells a bag of 5 lemons for $2.00. I'm supposed to find out how much each lemon costs individually.

Hmm, unit cost is usually the cost per item, right? So if I have 5 lemons for $2, I can find the cost per lemon by dividing the total cost by the number of lemons. That makes sense because if I split $2 into 5 equal parts, each part would be the cost of one lemon.

Let me write that down: total cost is $2.00, and there are 5 lemons. So the calculation should be $2.00 divided by 5. Wait, how does that division work? Let me think. 2 divided by 5 is 0.4. So that would be $0.40 per lemon.

Wait, but let me double-check. If each lemon is $0.40, then 5 lemons would be 5 times 0.40, which is $2.00. Yeah, that adds up correctly. So the unit cost is $0.40.

Looking at the options, I see option G is $0.40. So that must be the correct answer.

The unit cost is calculated by dividing the total cost ($2.00) by the number of lemons (5). This gives $0.40 per lemon.
