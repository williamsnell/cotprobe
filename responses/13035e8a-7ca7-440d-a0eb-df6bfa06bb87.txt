Question:

John is playing a game in which he tries to obtain the highest number possible. He must put the symbols +, $\times$, and - (plus, times, and minus) in the following blanks, using each symbol exactly once:\[2 \underline{\hphantom{8}} 4 \underline{\hphantom{8}} 6 \underline{\hphantom{8}} 8.\] John cannot use parentheses or rearrange the numbers. What is the highest possible number that John could obtain?

A: 22
B: 90
C: 100
D: 78
E: 99
F: 46
G: 56
H: 50
I: 66
J: 38

Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this math problem where John has to place the symbols +, ×, and - into the blanks in the expression 2 _ 4 _ 6 _ 8. He has to use each symbol exactly once, and he can't rearrange the numbers or use parentheses. The goal is to get the highest possible number. The options are A through J, with numbers like 22, 90, 100, etc. I need to figure out which one is the correct answer.

First, I'll list out the expression: 2 _ 4 _ 6 _ 8. There are three blanks, and I have to use each of the three symbols once. So each symbol will be used exactly once in the blanks. That means one of them will be +, one ×, and one -.

Since the goal is to maximize the result, I should think about how each operation affects the overall value. Multiplication can lead to larger numbers, but it depends on where it's placed. Plus adds numbers, which is good, but minus can decrease the total, so I want to minimize the impact of the minus.

Let me consider possible placements of the symbols. Since there are three operations and three blanks, I can think about all possible permutations, but that might take too long. Maybe I can find the best way by strategic thinking.

Let's break it down step by step.

The expression is evaluated from left to right without parentheses, so the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) applies. Wait, but without parentheses, multiplication has higher precedence than addition and subtraction. So, the multiplication will be done before addition and subtraction unless there's a minus before it, which might change things.

Wait, actually, in the absence of parentheses, the operations are evaluated in the order of their precedence: multiplication comes before addition and subtraction. But since the operations are placed between the numbers, the order in which they're placed affects the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the order of operations correctly. Let me think: when evaluating expressions without parentheses, multiplication is done before addition and subtraction. So, for example, 2 + 4 × 6 - 8 would be calculated as 2 + (4×6) -8 = 2 +24 -8 = 18.

But if the operations are arranged differently, the order might change. For example, if the multiplication is between 6 and 8, like 2 +4 -6 ×8, that would be 2+4 - (6×8) = 6 -48 = -42, which is worse.

So, to maximize the result, I want the multiplication to be applied to the largest possible numbers. Let's see.

Possible approaches:

1. Place × between 4 and 6, because 4×6 is 24, which is a good number, but then we have 2 +24 -8? Wait, but that would be 2 + (4×6) -8 = 2+24-8=18. That's not very high.

Wait, but let me check the exact placement. Let me try different arrangements.

First, let's list all possible permutations of the operators. There are 3! =6 permutations.

The possible operator orders are:

1. +, ×, -
2. +, -, ×
3. ×, +, -
4. ×, -, +
5. -, +, ×
6. -, ×, +

Wait, but since each symbol is used once, each permutation is possible. But maybe some will give better results.

Let me evaluate each permutation.

Case 1: +, ×, -
Expression: 2 + 4 × 6 -8
Calculation: 2 + (4×6) -8 = 2 +24 -8 = 18.

Case 2: +, -, ×
Expression: 2 +4 -6 ×8
Calculation: 2 +4 - (6×8) = 6 -48 = -42.

Case 3: ×, +, -
Expression: 2 ×4 +6 -8
Calculation: (2×4) +6 -8 =8 +6 -8=6.

Case4: ×, -, +
Expression: 2 ×4 -6 +8
Calculation: (2×4) -6 +8=8-6+8=10.

Case5: -, +, ×
Expression: 2 -4 +6 ×8
Calculation: 2 -4 + (6×8)= -2 +48=46.

Case6: -, ×, +
Expression: 2 -4 ×6 +8
Calculation: 2 - (4×6) +8=2-24+8= -14.

So, from these calculations, the results are:

Case1:18, Case2:-42, Case3:6, Case4:10, Case5:46, Case6:-14.

The highest among these is 46, which comes from Case5: 2 -4 +6 ×8 =46.

But wait, the options include 46 as option F, but the options also have higher numbers like 90, 100, etc. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the operator placements. Because in some cases, the order of operations might allow for a different calculation. Let me double-check, perhaps I missed a higher value.

Wait, perhaps if I place the multiplication after a larger number, maybe 8, but I can't rearrange the numbers, so 8 is fixed at the end.

Wait, another approach: maybe placing the multiplication between 6 and 8, but with a plus before it. Let me see.

Wait, let me consider if the order of operations can be used differently. For example, if I have 2 +4 ×6 -8, as before, that's 18. But maybe if I have 2 ×4 +6 ×8, but that would require two ×, which I can't do because each symbol is used once.

Wait, perhaps I can structure the expression so that the multiplication is applied after adding a larger number. Let me think.

Wait another approach: what if I have 2 +4 ×6 -8? As before, that's 18. But what if I arrange the operations as 2 ×4 +6 -8? That's 8 +6 -8=6, which is lower.

Alternatively, 2 × (4 +6) -8. But wait, that would require parentheses, which are not allowed. So that's not possible.

Wait, another thought: perhaps using the minus before the multiplication. For example, 2 +4 × (6 -8). But again, parentheses are not allowed, so that's invalid.

Wait, perhaps the placement of the minus can affect the result more. Let's see.

Wait, perhaps if I place the minus between 2 and 4, and then use multiplication after that. So, 2 -4 ×6 +8. That would be 2 -24 +8= -14, which is lower.

Alternatively, 2 ×4 -6 +8=8-6+8=10.

Wait, but earlier I found that 2 -4 +6 ×8=46. That's 2-4= -2, then -2 + (6×8)= -2 +48=46.

Is there a way to get a higher number than 46?

Let me think of all possible operator arrangements again.

Wait, perhaps I missed a permutation. Let me list all possible operator sequences again.

Wait, the three operators are +, ×, -. So the possible permutations are:

1. +, ×, -
2. +, -, ×
3. ×, +, -
4. ×, -, +
5. -, +, ×
6. -, ×, +

I think I covered all six cases earlier, but let me recheck each one.

Case1: +, ×, -: 2 +4 ×6 -8 = 2 +24 -8=18.

Case2: +, -, ×: 2 +4 -6 ×8=6 -48= -42.

Case3: ×, +, -: 2 ×4 +6 -8=8 +6 -8=6.

Case4: ×, -, +: 2 ×4 -6 +8=8-6+8=10.

Case5: -, +, ×: 2 -4 +6 ×8= -2 +48=46.

Case6: -, ×, +: 2 -4 ×6 +8=2 -24 +8= -14.

So the maximum from these is 46.

But the options include higher numbers, like 90, 100, etc. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering that the order of operations allows for a different grouping. For example, if I have 2 +4 ×6 -8, that's 2 +24 -8=18. But if I have 2 ×4 +6 ×8, but that would require two ×, which I can't do. So that's not allowed.

Wait another approach: perhaps if I place the minus after the multiplication. Let's see.

For example: 2 +4 × (6 -8). But without parentheses, that's not allowed. So that would be 2 +4 ×6 -8, which is 18.

Alternatively, 2 ×4 +6 -8=8 +6 -8=6.

Wait, perhaps I can arrange the operators such that the multiplication is with a larger number.

Wait, maybe 2 × (4 +6) -8. Again, without parentheses, that's 2 ×4 +6 -8=8 +6 -8=6.

Alternatively, 2 +4 ×6 -8=18.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a way to have a higher result. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps if I place the multiplication between 6 and 8, and have a plus before it. So, 2 +4 -6 ×8=2+4-48=6-48=-42, which is worse.

Alternatively, 2 ×4 -6 +8=8-6+8=10.

Wait, but the highest I can get is 46 from 2 -4 +6 ×8.

Wait, but let me check that calculation again. 2 -4 is -2, then +6×8 is +48, so -2+48=46. That seems correct.

But wait, looking at the options, 46 is option F. But the options also have 90, 100, etc. So maybe there's a way to get a higher number.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the order of operations. Let me think again about how the operations are evaluated.

In the expression 2 -4 +6 ×8, the multiplication is done first: 6×8=48. Then, the expression becomes 2 -4 +48. Now, since addition and subtraction are left-associative, it's evaluated as (2 -4) +48= (-2)+48=46.

Alternatively, if the expression were 2 - (4 +6 ×8), but that would require parentheses, which are not allowed.

Wait, another thought: perhaps if I arrange the operations as 2 +4 ×6 -8, which is 2 +24 -8=18.

Wait, but maybe there's a way to make the multiplication apply to a larger number. For example, if I can have 2 ×4 +6 ×8, but that would require two ×, which I can't do.

Wait, perhaps if I have 2 × (4 +6) -8. Without parentheses, that's 2 ×4 +6 -8=8 +6 -8=6.

Hmm. I'm not seeing a way to get higher than 46. But let me check if I missed any operator permutations.

Wait, another permutation: perhaps placing the minus before the multiplication. Let me see.

Wait, the permutation -, ×, + would be 2 -4 ×6 +8. That's 2 -24 +8= -14.

Wait, maybe I can try another approach: perhaps the minus is applied after the multiplication. For example, 2 +4 × (6 -8). But again, without parentheses, that's 2 +4 ×6 -8=2+24-8=18.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a way to have the multiplication applied to a larger number by placing it after a plus. Let me think: 2 +4 ×6 -8=18. If I can somehow have 2 ×4 +6 ×8, but that's not possible with only one ×.

Wait, perhaps if I have 2 ×4 +6 -8=8+6-8=6.

Alternatively, 2 ×4 -6 +8=8-6+8=10.

Wait, maybe I should try using the minus in a way that it doesn't subtract too much. For example, placing the minus between 6 and 8, but that gives 2 +4 -6 ×8=6-48=-42.

Alternatively, 2 +4 ×6 -8=18.

Wait, perhaps I should try to have the multiplication after a larger number. For example, 2 +4 ×6 -8=18, which is better than some other options but not as high as 46.

Wait, let me think again about the permutation that gives 46: 2 -4 +6 ×8.

Is there a way to get a higher number? Let me see.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the expression can be evaluated differently if the multiplication is after a subtraction. For example, 2 +4 -6 ×8=6-48=-42.

No, that's worse.

Wait, perhaps 2 ×4 +6 -8=8+6-8=6.

No, that's worse.

Wait, maybe 2 +4 ×6 -8=18.

No, that's lower than 46.

Wait, perhaps I can try 2 ×4 -6 +8=8-6+8=10.

No, that's lower.

So, from all the possible permutations, the highest I can get is 46, which is option F.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 90, which is much higher. How could that be achieved?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the operator placements. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps if I place the multiplication between 2 and 4, then add the result to 6, and then subtract 8. So 2 ×4 +6 -8=8+6-8=6.

Not higher than 46.

Alternatively, 2 ×4 -6 +8=8-6+8=10.

Wait, but perhaps if I place the multiplication after a larger number, like 2 +4 ×6 -8=18.

Wait, but that's still lower than 46.

Wait, perhaps I can think of a different operator arrangement. Let me try to list all possible operator combinations again.

Wait, perhaps I missed a permutation where the multiplication is after a plus, leading to a higher number.

For example, 2 +4 ×6 -8=18.

Alternatively, 2 +4 -6 ×8=6-48=-42.

Wait, perhaps if I place the multiplication between 4 and 6, and then subtract 8 after adding 2. So 2 +4 ×6 -8=18.

Wait, but 46 is higher. So perhaps 46 is the maximum.

Wait, but I'm confused because option B is 90, which is much higher. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me think differently: perhaps the expression can be evaluated in a way that the multiplication is done after adding numbers, thus leading to a larger product.

Wait, for example, 2 +4 ×6 -8. The multiplication is done first: 4×6=24. Then 2+24=26, then 26-8=18.

Alternatively, if I can arrange it so that 2 +4 is added first, but without parentheses, that's not allowed. So 2 +4 ×6 -8=18.

Wait, perhaps if I have 2 × (4 +6) -8=2×10 -8=20-8=12. But that requires parentheses, which are not allowed.

Alternatively, 2 ×4 +6 -8=8+6-8=6.

Wait, perhaps I can't get higher than 46 without parentheses. So maybe 46 is the correct answer, which is option F.

But let me think again about the permutation that gives 46: 2 -4 +6 ×8.

That's 2-4= -2, then -2 + (6×8)= -2+48=46.

Is there a way to get a higher number than 46? Let's see.

Wait, perhaps if I can have the multiplication after a larger number. For example, 2 +4 ×6 -8=18.

No, that's lower.

Wait, another thought: perhaps if I place the minus after the multiplication, but I can't because the operators are fixed in their positions.

Wait, maybe if I have 2 ×4 +6 ×8, but that would require two ×, which isn't allowed.

Wait, perhaps I'm stuck with 46 as the highest possible.

Wait, but the options include 90, which is much higher. Let me see if I can find a way to get 90.

Wait, 90 would require a much larger multiplication. Let's see: 6×8=48. 4×8=32. 2×8=16. 4×6=24. 2×4=8. Hmm.

Wait, 2 +4 ×6 ×8 would be 2 + (4×6×8)=2+192=194, but that requires two ×, which isn't allowed.

Alternatively, 2 ×4 ×6 +8=48+8=56, but that's using two ×, which isn't allowed.

Wait, but I can only use each symbol once. So maybe 90 can't be achieved.

Wait, let's see: 2 +4 × (6 +8)=2+4×14=2+56=58. But again, parentheses aren't allowed.

Alternatively, 2 +4 ×6 +8=2+24+8=34. That's lower than 46.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The highest I can get is 46, so the answer is F:46.
</think>

The highest possible number John can obtain is 46 by placing the symbols as -, +, ×, resulting in the expression 2 - 4 + 6 × 8, which evaluates to 46.

Answer: F
