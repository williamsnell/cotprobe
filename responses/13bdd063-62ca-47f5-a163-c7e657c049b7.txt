Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the inverse Laplace transform of F(s) = (2s² - 4) / [(s - 2)(s + 1)(s - 3)]. Hmm, I remember that partial fraction decomposition is the way to go here. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the denominator is already factored into linear terms, which is good. The numerator is 2s² -4. I think I should express F(s) as a sum of simpler fractions. So, I'll write it as:

F(s) = (A)/(s - 2) + (B)/(s + 1) + (C)/(s - 3)

Where A, B, and C are constants I need to find. To find these, I'll multiply both sides by the denominator (s - 2)(s + 1)(s - 3) to eliminate the fractions:

2s² - 4 = A(s + 1)(s - 3) + B(s - 2)(s - 3) + C(s - 2)(s + 1)

Now, I'll expand each term on the right side.

Let's compute each part:

A(s + 1)(s - 3) = A(s² - 2s -3)
B(s - 2)(s - 3) = B(s² -5s +6)
C(s - 2)(s +1) = C(s² - s - 2)

So, putting it all together:

2s² -4 = A(s² - 2s -3) + B(s² -5s +6) + C(s² - s -2)

Now, let's combine like terms:

The s² terms: (A + B + C)s²
The s terms: (-2A -5B -C)s
The constants: (-3A +6B -2C)

So, the equation becomes:

2s² -4 = (A + B + C)s² + (-2A -5B -C)s + (-3A +6B -2C)

Now, we can set up equations by equating the coefficients of each power of s.

For s²: 2 = A + B + C
For s: 0 = -2A -5B -C (since there's no s term on the left)
For constants: -4 = -3A +6B -2C

So, now we have a system of three equations:

1) A + B + C = 2
2) -2A -5B -C = 0
3) -3A +6B -2C = -4

Let me write them down clearly:

1) A + B + C = 2
2) -2A -5B - C = 0
3) -3A +6B -2C = -4

Hmm, solving this system. Maybe I can use substitution or elimination. Let's try elimination.

First, from equation 1: C = 2 - A - B

Let's substitute C into equations 2 and 3.

Substituting into equation 2:

-2A -5B - (2 - A - B) = 0

Simplify:

-2A -5B -2 + A + B = 0
(-2A + A) + (-5B + B) -2 = 0
- A -4B -2 = 0
So, rearranged: A +4B = -2 ...(4)

Now substitute C into equation 3:

-3A +6B -2*(2 - A - B) = -4

Expanding:

-3A +6B -4 +2A +2B = -4

Combine like terms:

(-3A +2A) + (6B +2B) -4 = -4
(-A) + 8B -4 = -4

Add 4 to both sides:

-A +8B = 0
So, A = 8B ...(5)

Now, substitute A =8B into equation (4):

8B +4B = -2
12B = -2 → B = -2/12 = -1/6

So, B = -1/6. Then from equation (5), A=8*(-1/6)= -4/3.

Now, find C using equation 1:

C= 2 - A - B = 2 - (-4/3) - (-1/6)
= 2 +4/3 +1/6

Convert to sixths:

2 = 12/6, 4/3=8/6, 1/6=1/6.

So, 12/6 +8/6 +1/6 = 21/6 = 7/2.

So, C=7/2.

Therefore, the partial fractions are:

F(s) = (-4/3)/(s-2) + (-1/6)/(s+1) + (7/2)/(s-3)

Now, taking the inverse Laplace transform term by term.

The inverse Laplace transform of 1/(s - a) is e^{at}.

So,

-4/(3(s-2)) → (-4/3) e^{2t}
-1/(6(s+1)) → (-1/6) e^{-t}
7/(2(s-3)) → (7/2) e^{3t}

Putting it all together:

f(t) = (-4/3)e^{2t} - (1/6)e^{-t} + (7/2)e^{3t}

Wait, let me check the options. Let me look at the options again.

Looking at the options, option F is: f(t) = [(-4)/3]e^2t - (1/6)e^-t + (7/2)e^3t. Hmm, but I have - (1/6)e^{-t}. So that matches option F.

Wait, but let me double-check my partial fractions because sometimes signs can be tricky.

Wait, in the partial fractions, F(s) = (-4/3)/(s-2) + (-1/6)/(s+1) + (7/2)/(s-3). So the inverse transforms are correct.

But looking at the options, option F is: (-4/3)e^2t - (1/6)e^-t + (7/2)e^3t.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is as I have.

Wait, but let me cross-verify with the options given.

Looking back, the options are:

A: f(t) = [(-4)/3]e^-2t - (1/6)e^2t + (7/2)e^-3t

B: f(t) = [(-4)/3]e^2t - (1/6)e^-t - (7/2)e^3t

C: f(t) = [(-4)/3]e^3t - (1/6)e^2t + (7/2)e^-t

D: f(t) = [(-4)/3]e^-2t - (1/6)e^t - (7/2)e^3t

E: f(t) = [(-4)/3]e^2t + (1/6)e^t - (7/2)e^3t

F: f(t) = [(-4)/3]e^2t - (1/6)e^-t + (7/2)e^3t

G: f(t) = 4e^2t - (1/3)e^-t + (7/6)e^3t

H: f(t) = [(-4)/3]e^2t - (1/6)e^t + (7/2)e^3t

I: f(t) = [(-4)/3]e^2t + (1/6)e^-t + (7/2)e^3t

J: f(t) = (4/3)e^2t + (1/6)e^-t - (7/2)e^3t

So, the one I derived is exactly option F: (-4/3)e^2t - (1/6)e^-t + (7/2)e^3t.

Wait, but looking again, I think I might have made a mistake. Because the denominator in F(s) has (s+1), which would correspond to e^{-t}, but I thought the inverse transform of 1/(s + a) is e^{-at}, because s + a = s - (-a). So, yes, correct.

But wait, let me check the partial fractions again because sometimes signs can be confusing.

Wait, when I did the partial fraction decomposition, I had:

F(s) = (2s² -4)/[(s-2)(s+1)(s-3)] = A/(s-2) + B/(s+1) + C/(s-3)

Then, after solving, I got A=-4/3, B=-1/6, and C=7/2.

So F(s) = (-4/3)/(s-2) + (-1/6)/(s+1) + (7/2)/(s-3)

Which gives f(t) = (-4/3)e^{2t} + (-1/6)e^{-t} + (7/2)e^{3t}

Wait, so that's exactly option F.

Wait, but looking again, in the options, option F is: (-4/3)e^2t - (1/6)e^-t + (7/2)e^3t.

Yes, which matches. So the answer should be option F.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain because sometimes the signs can flip. Let me double-check the partial fractions.

Wait, when I set up the equation:

2s² -4 = A(s+1)(s-3) + B(s-2)(s-3) + C(s-2)(s+1)

Let me pick specific s values to check.

For example, set s=2:

Left side: 2*(4) -4 =8-4=4

Right side: A*(3)(-1) + B*(0) + C*(0) → A*(-3) =4 → A= -4/3.

Which matches what I found earlier.

Similarly, set s=-1:

Left side: 2*(1) -4= 2-4= -2.

Right side: A*(0) + B*(-3)(-4) + C*(-3)(1) → B*(12) + C*(-3)= -2.

We know A=-4/3, B=-1/6, C=7/2.

So, 12*(-1/6) + (-3)*(7/2) = (-2) + (-21/2) = (-4/2 -21/2) = (-25/2). Hmm, that's not equal to -2. Wait, that's a problem.

Wait, that suggests I made a mistake in my calculation. So, I must have an error somewhere.

Wait, let's recalculate the system of equations.

We had:

1) A + B + C = 2
2) -2A -5B -C = 0
3) -3A +6B -2C = -4

From equation 1: C=2 -A -B.

Substituting into equation 2:

-2A -5B - (2 - A - B) = 0 → -2A -5B -2 +A + B =0 → (-A) -4B -2 = 0 → A +4B = -2 ...(4)

Equation 3 substitution:

-3A +6B -2*(2 -A -B) = -4 → -3A +6B -4 +2A +2B = -4 → (-A) +8B -4 = -4 → -A +8B=0 → A=8B ...(5)

Substitute equation (5) into equation (4):

8B +4B = -2 → 12B= -2 → B= -2/12= -1/6.

Then, A=8*(-1/6)= -4/3.

Then, C=2 - (-4/3) - (-1/6) = 2 +4/3 +1/6.

Convert to sixths: 2=12/6, 4/3=8/6, 1/6=1/6. Sum:12+8+1=21 → 21/6=7/2.

So, A=-4/3, B=-1/6, C=7/2.

Wait, but when I plug s=-1, I get:

Left side: 2*(-1)^2 -4=2*1 -4= -2.

Right side: A*(0) + B*(-1-2)(-1-3) + C*(-1-2)(-1+1).

Wait, no, wait. When s=-1, B is multiplied by (s-2)(s-3). So, (s-2)= -3, (s-3)= -4. So B*(-3)*(-4)= B*12.

C is multiplied by (s-2)(s+1). (s-2)= -3, (s+1)=0. So, C*(-3)*0=0.

So, right side at s=-1: A*(s+1)(s-3)=A*(0)*(-4)=0; B*(s-2)(s-3)=B*(-3)*(-4)=12B; C*(s-2)(s+1)=C*(-3)*0=0.

So, right side =12B.

So, 12B= -2 → B= -2/12= -1/6. Which matches what I found.

But earlier, when I substituted into equation 3, I think I might have made a mistake.

Wait, equation 3: -3A +6B -2C = -4.

Let me substitute A=-4/3, B=-1/6, C=7/2.

So, -3*(-4/3) +6*(-1/6) -2*(7/2) = ?

Compute each term:

-3*(-4/3)=4.

6*(-1/6)= -1.

-2*(7/2)= -7.

So sum: 4 -1 -7= -4. Which matches equation 3.

Hmm, so when s=-1, the right side is 12B=12*(-1/6)= -2, which matches the left side of -2.

So perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier substitution when I thought it didn't match. It does match.

So, the partial fractions are correct.

So, f(t)= (-4/3)e^{2t} - (1/6)e^{-t} + (7/2)e^{3t}.

Looking back at the options, that's option F.

Wait, but looking at option F: f(t) = [(-4)/3]e^2t - (1/6)e^-t + (7/2)e^3t.

Yes, that's exactly what I have. So the correct answer should be option F.

To find the inverse Laplace transform of \( F(s) = \frac{2s^2 - 4}{(s - 2)(s + 1)(s - 3)} \), we use partial fraction decomposition:

\[
F(s) = \frac{A}{s - 2} + \frac{B}{s + 1} + \frac{C}{s - 3}
\]

Multiplying both sides by the denominator and solving for \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\), we find:

\[
A = -\frac{4}{3}, \quad B = -\frac{1}{6}, \quad C = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Thus,

\[
F(s) = \frac{-4/3}{s - 2} + \frac{-1/6}{s + 1} + \frac{7/2}{s - 3}
\]

Taking the inverse Laplace transform of each term:

\[
f(t) = \left(-\frac{4}{3}\right)e^{2t} - \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)e^{-t} + \left(\frac{7}{2}\right)e^{3t}
\]

This matches option **F**.
