Okay, I've got this problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about biology and some calculations. But let's take it step by step. The question is about alpha-helices in keratin fibers and how many amino acid residues are added per second based on hair growth rate. Hmm.

So, the problem says a turn of the alpha-helix (which is 3.6 residues) is 5.41 Ångströms long. Wait, I remember that an alpha-helix has a certain pitch, which is the distance covered in one full turn. Oh right, the pitch is what I need here because the hair growth is along the axis of the helix. 

Hair grows at 6 inches per year. I need to find out how many residues are added per second. So, first, I'll convert the hair growth rate into a per-second measurement. Let's see, 6 inches per year. There are 12 months in a year, 30 days per month roughly, 24 hours a day, 60 minutes, 60 seconds. So, 6 inches/year divided by (12 * 30 * 24 * 60 * 60) seconds. Let me calculate that. 

6 inches/year is 6 / (12*30*24*60*60) inches per second. Let me compute the denominator: 12*30 is 360, times 24 is 8640, times 60 is 518400, times 60 again is 31,104,000. So 6 divided by 31,104,000 is approximately 1.929e-7 inches per second. 

Wait, but I should probably keep more decimals for accuracy. Alternatively, maybe I can convert inches to centimeters because the helix length is in Ångströms, which is 1e-8 meters. Wait, 1 inch is 2.54 cm, so 6 inches is 15.24 cm. Wait, but perhaps I should convert everything into meters. 

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of meters per second. So 6 inches per year is 0.1524 meters per year. Then, per second, that's 0.1524 / (365 * 24 * 3600) seconds. Let me calculate that.

365 days * 24 hours/day = 8760 hours. 8760 * 3600 seconds = 31,536,000 seconds in a year. So 0.1524 meters / 31,536,000 s ≈ 4.833e-9 meters per second. 

Wait, maybe I should have kept it in cm for easier conversion. 6 inches is 15.24 cm, so per year, 15.24 cm/year. To get cm/s, it's 15.24 / (365 * 24 * 3600). Let's compute 365 * 24 = 8760, times 3600 is 31,536,000 seconds. So 15.24 / 31,536,000 ≈ 4.833e-7 cm/s. 

Wait, but 1 cm is 1e8 Ångströms, because 1 Å is 1e-8 cm. So, 4.833e-7 cm/s is 4.833e-7 * 1e8 Å/s = 48.33 Å/s. Wait, that makes sense because 6 inches per year is a small rate, so 48.33 Å per second? Hmm, that seems high, but maybe.

Now, the alpha-helix has a pitch of 5.41 Å per turn, and each turn has 3.6 residues. So, the length added per residue would be (5.41 Å) / 3.6 residues. Wait, no, because each turn adds 5.41 Å, and each turn is 3.6 residues. So per residue, the length is 5.41 / 3.6 Å per residue. 

Wait, but I think I need to relate the growth rate to how many residues are being added per second. So, hair is growing along the helix's axis at a rate of 48.33 Å/s. Each turn of the helix is 3.6 residues and contributes 5.41 Å in length. So, for each 5.41 Å of growth, 3.6 residues are added. 

So, the number of residues per second would be (growth rate in Å/s) * (residues per Å). To find residues per Å, it's 3.6 residues / 5.41 Å = approximately 0.665 residues per Å. 

So, 48.33 Å/s * 0.665 residues/Å ≈ 32.19 residues per second. Wait, looking at the options, 32 is option I. But let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake.

Wait, wait, maybe I messed up a unit conversion. Let me go back. 

Hair growth rate: 6 inches/year. Let's convert 6 inches to meters: 6 * 0.0254 = 0.1524 meters/year. 

Convert meters/year to meters/second: 0.1524 / (365 * 24 * 3600) = 0.1524 / 31,536,000 ≈ 4.833e-9 m/s. 

Convert meters to Ångströms: 1 m = 1e10 Å. So, 4.833e-9 m/s = 4.833e-9 * 1e10 Å/s = 48.33 Å/s. That's correct.

Now, each turn is 3.6 residues and 5.41 Å. So, the number of turns per second is 48.33 Å/s divided by 5.41 Å/turn ≈ 8.93 turns per second.

Each turn is 3.6 residues, so 8.93 turns/s * 3.6 residues/turn ≈ 32.15 residues per second. So about 32 res/sec, which is option I.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I is 32. So that's the answer.

The problem involves calculating the number of amino acid residues added per second to an α-helix in keratin fiber, given that hair grows at 6 inches per year. 

1. **Convert hair growth rate to Å/s**:  
   Hair grows at 6 inches/year. Converting inches to meters:  
   \( 6 \, \text{inches/year} = 0.1524 \, \text{meters/year} \).  
   Converting meters/year to meters/second:  
   \( 0.1524 \, \text{m/year} \div (365 \times 24 \times 3600) \, \text{s/year} \approx 4.833 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m/s} \).  
   Converting meters to Ångströms (\( 1 \, \text{m} = 10^{10} \, \text{Å} \)):  
   \( 4.833 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m/s} \times 10^{10} \, \text{Å/m} = 48.33 \, \text{Å/s} \).

2. **Relate hair growth to α-helix residues**:  
   Each turn of the α-helix is 5.41 Å long and contains 3.6 residues.  
   Residues per Å:  
   \( \frac{3.6 \, \text{residues}}{5.41 \, \text{Å}} \approx 0.665 \, \text{residues/Å} \).  
   Residues per second:  
   \( 48.33 \, \text{Å/s} \times 0.665 \, \text{residues/Å} \approx 32.15 \, \text{residues/s} \).

3. **Select the closest option**:  
   The calculated rate is approximately 32 residues per second, which corresponds to **option I**.
