Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out the correct answers step by step. Let's break it down. The question has two parts: (i) finding the circular-mil area of a wire with different diameters, and (ii) determining the resistance of a copper wire at a higher temperature. Hmm, I remember some formulas from my physics classes, but I'm a bit rusty, so I'll have to think carefully.

Starting with part (i). The circular-mil area is a unit used to describe the area of a wire. I think the formula for the area of a circle is A = πr², right? But circular mils are calculated differently because a mil is 0.001 inches. Oh wait, I think the formula for circular mils is actually A (in circular mils) = (diameter in mils)². Because the area in square mils is π*(radius in mils)², but since diameter is twice the radius, and if you square the diameter in mils, that gives you the area in circular mils multiplied by π, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify.

Wait, no, I think the circular mil area is calculated as π*(d/2)², where d is the diameter in inches. But since 1 mil is 0.001 inches, converting to mils first might be easier. So, the formula is A = (d in mils)² * π / 4, but wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. Alternatively, I've heard that the area in circular mils is simply (diameter in mils) squared. Because 1 circular mil is the area of a circle with a diameter of 1 mil, which is (0.001 inches)² * π, but the unit is defined such that the area in circular mils is (diameter in mils)². Wait, no, that can't be right because the area of a circle is πr², so if diameter is d, then radius r = d/2. So area in square mils would be π*(d/2)². But circular mils are defined as the area in square mils divided by π, so A (circular mils) = π*(d/2)^2 / π = (d/2)^2. Wait, that would make A = (d/2)^2 * mils squared. Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, I think I remember that the formula for circular mils is A = (d)^2, where d is the diameter in mils. Because if d is in mils, then the area in circular mils is (d)^2. Let me check with a small example. If the diameter is 2 mils, then radius is 1 mil. Area would be π*(1)^2 = π square mils. But in circular mils, the area is (2)^2 = 4 circular mils. Wait, that doesn't match because π is about 3.14, so 4 is bigger than π. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the terms. Alternatively, perhaps the area in circular mils is (diameter in mils)^2 multiplied by π. No, that can't be right either because that would make the area larger than it should be.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact formula. Oh, wait, I can't actually look it up, so I'll have to proceed with what I think. I'm pretty sure that the formula for circular-mil area is A = (d)^2, where d is in mils. So for any diameter in mils, square it to get the area in circular mils. So for example, a wire with diameter 1 mil would have an area of 1 circular mil. That makes sense because 1 circular mil is the area of a circle with diameter 1 mil. So, the formula is simply A = d², where d is in mils.

Wait, but if d is in inches, then I need to convert it to mils first. Because 1 inch is 1000 mils. So, if the diameter is given in inches, I multiply by 1000 to get it in mils, then square it. So, for example, a 0.1-inch diameter: 0.1 inches * 1000 mils/inch = 100 mils. Then area is (100)^2 = 10,000 circular mils. Wait, but looking at the options, option D for part (i) (a) is 10,000. So that's possible.

Wait, let's test this with the given options. For (i) (a) 0.1 in. diameter: 0.1 * 1000 = 100 mils. Area is 100^2 = 10,000 cir mils. So option D's (a) is 10,000, which matches. Let's check option A: 12,500. That would be 111.8 mils diameter, because sqrt(12500)= approx 111.8. So that's not 0.1 in. So 0.1 in. is 100 mils, area 10,000. So (i)(a) is 10,000, so part (i) for (a) is 10,000. Looking at the options, D's (i)(a) is 10,000, so that's a candidate.

Next, (i)(b) is 0.2 inches. 0.2 *1000=200 mils. Area is 200^2=40,000 circular mils. Looking at the options, D's (i)(b) is 40,000. So that's correct. Option A's (b) is 50,000, which would be for 223.6 mils, which is 0.2236 inches. So no, 0.2 is 200, area 40,000.

Then (i)(c) is 0.325 inches. 0.325 *1000=325 mils. Area is 325^2. Let's compute that: 325 *325. Let's see, 300^2=90,000. 25^2=625. Then cross terms: 2*(300)(25)=15,000. So total 90,000 + 15,000 +625 = 105,625. So area is 105,625 circular mils. Looking at the options, D's (i)(c) is 105,625, which matches. So for part (i), the correct answers are (a) 10,000; (b)40,000; (c)105,625, which matches option D's part (i). So I think part (i) is correct in option D.

Now, part (ii): the resistance of a copper wire is 3.60 ohms at 20°C. What is its resistance at 80°C? I remember that the resistance of a conductor changes with temperature. The formula I think is R = R0 * (1 + α*(T - T0)), where α is the temperature coefficient of resistance for copper, R0 is the resistance at the initial temperature T0, and T is the new temperature.

Wait, but wait, I think the exact formula is R = R0 * (1 + αΔT), where ΔT is T - T0. So for copper, I think the temperature coefficient α is about 0.00393 per degree Celsius. Let me confirm: yes, α for copper is approximately 0.00393 /°C.

So, R0 = 3.60 ohms at T0=20°C. Now, T is 80°C. So ΔT =80 -20=60°C. So R = 3.60 * (1 + 0.00393 *60). Let's compute that.

First, 0.00393 *60 = 0.2358. Then 1 + 0.2358 = 1.2358. Multiply by 3.60: 3.60 *1.2358 ≈ ?

Let's compute 3.6 *1.2358. 3 *1.2358=3.7074; 0.6*1.2358=0.74148. Adding them together: 3.7074 + 0.74148 = 4.44888. So approximately 4.45 ohms.

Looking at the options, option D's part (ii) is 4.45 ohms, which matches our calculation. So option D's part (ii) is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. 0.00393 *60 = 0.2358. Adding 1 gives 1.2358. Multiply by 3.60: 3.60 *1.2358.

Alternatively, 3.6 *1.2358: 3.6 *1=3.6; 3.6 *0.2358= 0.84888. So total 3.6+0.84888=4.44888, which is about 4.45 ohms. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but I think there's another thing: sometimes the formula is written as R = R0 * (1 + α(T - T0)), but sometimes it's approximated as R = R0 + R0 * α *ΔT. Either way, the result should be the same.

So, putting it all together, part (i) gives us 10,000, 40,000, 105,625 circular mils, and part (ii) gives 4.45 ohms. Looking at the options, option D is (i) (a) 10,000, (b)40,000, (c)105,625, and (ii)4.45 ohms. That's exactly what we've got.

Wait, but I should check if any other option matches. Let me look at option H: part (i) (c) is 52,812, which is much lower than our 105,625. So no. Option E's (i) for (c) is 253,125, which is way higher. So no. So D is the only option that matches both parts.

The correct answer is determined by calculating the circular-mil area for each diameter and the resistance at 80°C. For part (i), the area in circular mils is the square of the diameter in mils. Converting inches to mils and squaring gives the correct areas. For part (ii), using the temperature coefficient formula yields a resistance of approximately 4.45 ohms. Option D matches both calculations.

Answer: D
