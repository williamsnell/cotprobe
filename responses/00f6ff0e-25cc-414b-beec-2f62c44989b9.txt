Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my Punnett squares, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says that the ability to roll the tongue is conferred by a dominant gene. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'R' and the recessive one as 'r'. People who can roll their tongues must have at least one dominant allele, so their genotypes would be either RR or Rr. Those who can't roll their tongues must be homozygous recessive, which is rr.

The problem states that 16% of the students cannot roll their tongues. So, the frequency of the recessive phenotype (rr) is 16%. Since the recessive phenotype only occurs when both alleles are recessive, we can use this information to find the frequency of the recessive allele (r) and then the heterozygous (Rr) frequency.

In a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of the genotypes are given by the equation p² + 2pq + q² = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. The percentage of people who can't roll their tongues is q², which is 16% or 0.16. So, q² = 0.16.

To find q, I take the square root of 0.16. The square root of 0.16 is 0.4 because 0.4 * 0.4 = 0.16. So, q = 0.4.

Now, since p + q = 1 (because these are the only two alleles), p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.

The heterozygous genotype (Rr) is represented by 2pq in the Hardy-Weinberg equation. Plugging in the values, 2pq = 2 * 0.6 * 0.4.

Let me calculate that: 0.6 times 0.4 is 0.24, and multiplied by 2 gives 0.48. So, the heterozygous frequency is 0.48, which is 48%.

Looking at the options, option F is 48%, so that should be the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check. So, if 16% are rr, then q is 0.4. p is 0.6. Then 2pq is 2*(0.6)*(0.4) = 0.48. Yep, that's 48% of the students are heterozygous. That makes sense because the heterozygotes are the ones who carry one dominant and one recessive allele, so they can roll their tongues but aren't homozygous dominant.

I think that's solid. So the answer must be F.

The ability to roll the tongue is determined by a dominant gene (R) and its recessive allele (r). Students who cannot roll their tongues are homozygous recessive (rr), which constitutes 16% of the population. Using Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium:

1. **q² = 0.16** → **q = 0.4** (frequency of the recessive allele).
2. **p = 1 - q = 0.6** (frequency of the dominant allele).
3. **Heterozygous frequency = 2pq = 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48** (48%).

Thus, 48% of the students are heterozygous.

Answer: F
