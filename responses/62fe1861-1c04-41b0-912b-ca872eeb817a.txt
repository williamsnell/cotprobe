Okay, so I've got this problem about tides changing in a bay. The water level varies sinusoidally. High tide was at 8 A.M., with the water level at 15 feet. Then, at low tide, which is 6 hours later at 2 P.M., the level was 3 feet. The question is asking how fast the water level was dropping at noon today. The answer needs to be in feet per hour.

Hmm, right, so this is a sinusoidal function problem. I remember that sinusoidal functions can model things like tides because they have a periodic, wave-like behavior. So the water level goes up and down in a regular cycle.

First, I think I need to model the water level as a function of time. Let's denote the time variable as t, where t=0 corresponds to 8 A.M. So at t=0, the water level is 15 feet (high tide). Then, at t=6 hours (2 P.M.), it's low tide at 3 feet.

Since the tide is sinusoidal, the general form of the function could be something like:

y(t) = A * sin(Bt + C) + D

But sometimes it's easier to use cosine because the maximum is at t=0, which might correspond to the amplitude peak. Alternatively, depending on how the function is set up, maybe a cosine function with a phase shift? Hmm, not sure yet. Let's think about the parameters.

The amplitude A is the maximum deviation from the central axis. The highest point is 15 feet, and the lowest is 3 feet. So the amplitude is the average of these two extremes. The average of 15 and 3 is (15 + 3)/2 = 9. So the amplitude is 9 feet. Wait, no, wait. The amplitude is actually half the difference between high and low tide. So high tide is 15, low is 3. The difference is 12 feet. So the amplitude, A, is 12/2 = 6 feet.

Wait, wait, I think I confused that. Let me clarify. The maximum level is 15, the minimum is 3. So the vertical shift D is the average of these two, which would be (15 + 3)/2 = 9. So the sinusoidal function will oscillate around this central level of 9 feet. So the amplitude is how much it goes above or below 9. Since from 9 to 15 is 6, and from 9 to 3 is also 6, the amplitude is 6 feet.

So the function could be written as y(t) = 6 * sin(Bt + C) + 9. Alternatively, since at t=0, the function is at maximum (high tide), which would correspond to the sine function being at its maximum point. But wait, the sine function reaches its maximum at π/2, so if we have a phase shift, perhaps it's better to model it with a cosine function, which reaches maximum at t=0.

So maybe using cosine would be better because at t=0, cos(0) is 1, which would give the maximum value. Let's try that.

So y(t) = A * cos(Bt) + D, where A is the amplitude, D is the vertical shift.

We know A is 6, D is 9. So y(t) = 6 cos(Bt) + 9.

Now, we need to find B. The period of the tide cycle is the time between two high tides or two low tides. Since high tide occurs every 12 hours, but in this problem, the high tide is at 8 A.M., low tide at 2 P.M., which is 6 hours later. Wait, but that's only half a period? Because from high to low is half the period, and then from low to next high is the other half.

Wait, the time from high tide to low tide is 6 hours, so the full period is 12 hours. So the period T is 12 hours.

In the cosine function, the period is 2π / B. So we have:

2π / B = 12 hours → B = 2π / 12 = π/6.

So the function becomes y(t) = 6 cos(π t /6) + 9.

Wait, let me check. At t=0 (8 A.M.), cos(0) is 1, so y(0) = 6*1 +9=15, which is correct. At t=6 hours (2 P.M.), cos(π*6/6)=cos(π)= -1, so y(6)=6*(-1)+9= 3. Perfect, that matches the given data.

Now, the question is about the rate at which the water level is dropping at noon today. Noon is 4 hours after 8 A.M., so t=4 hours.

We need to find the rate of change at t=4, which is the derivative of y(t) evaluated at t=4.

So first, find dy/dt.

dy/dt = derivative of 6 cos(π t/6) +9.

The derivative of cos(u) is -sin(u) * du/dt.

So dy/dt = 6*(-sin(π t/6)) * (π/6) ) + 0.

Simplify: the 6 and 6 cancel, so dy/dt = -π sin(π t/6).

At t=4, dy/dt = -π sin(π*4/6) = -π sin(2π/3).

What's sin(2π/3)? Well, 2π/3 is 120 degrees. Sin(120 degrees) is √3/2.

So dy/dt at t=4 is -π*(√3/2) = (-π√3)/2.

But the question is asking how fast the water level was dropping at noon. That means the rate is the magnitude of the negative derivative. Because a negative rate indicates the level is decreasing.

So the speed is |dy/dt| = (π√3)/2 feet per hour.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is π√3/2. So that should be the answer.

Wait, let me double-check.

Wait, dy/dt is negative, meaning the level is decreasing. So the rate of drop is the absolute value of dy/dt. So the answer is π√3/2, which is option F.

The problem involves modeling the water level in a bay as a sinusoidal function and finding the rate of change at a specific time. By analyzing the given data, the sinusoidal function is determined to be \( y(t) = 6\cos\left(\frac{\pi t}{6}\right) + 9 \), where \( t \) is the time in hours since 8 A.M. To find the rate of change at noon (4 hours after 8 A.M.), the derivative \( \frac{dy}{dt} \) is calculated as \( -\pi \sin\left(\frac{\pi t}{6}\right) \). Evaluating this at \( t = 4 \) gives \( -\frac{\pi \sqrt{3}}{2} \), and taking the absolute value yields the rate of drop as \( \frac{\pi \sqrt{3}}{2} \) feet per hour.
