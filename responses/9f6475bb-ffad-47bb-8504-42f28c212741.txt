Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about chemical shifts in acetaldehyde. I'm a bit rusty on my NMR concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question gives me the chemical shifts for two protons in acetaldehyde: the CH3 group at δ=2.20 and the CHO (aldehyde) proton at δ=9.80. The applied magnetic field is 1.5 T, and I need to find the difference in the local magnetic field between these two regions.

First, I remember that the chemical shift (δ) is related to the resonance frequency of the protons. The formula I think is δ = (Δν / ν0) * 1000, where Δν is the difference in frequency from the reference frequency ν0, which is typically the resonance frequency of TMS (tetramethylsilane) in a given magnetic field.

So, the local magnetic field at a proton is given by B_local = γ * (δ + 0), but wait, I think I might be mixing up some terms. Let me think again. The local field experienced by a proton depends on the shielding. The shielding determines how much the external magnetic field is felt by the proton. The shielding (σ) is related to the chemical shift by δ = (1 - σ) * (γ H0 / (2π)), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the formula I recall is that the chemical shift δ is proportional to the difference in shielding between the proton and the reference.

Wait, another approach: the local magnetic field (B) at a proton can be calculated using the formula B = γ * (δ + 0) * H0 / (2π), but I'm not confident. Maybe I should look up the relationship between chemical shift and magnetic field.

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is B_local = γ * (δ) * H0 / (2π). Hmm, but I might be getting this wrong. Let me think in terms of the Larmor equation.

The Larmor frequency ω is given by ω = γ * B. For a proton, γ is approximately 267.5 × 10^6 rad T^-1 s^-1. So, the resonance frequency ν is ω/(2π) = γ B/(2π).

In NMR, the chemical shift is the difference in frequency relative to a reference. So, the chemical shift δ is (ν_sample - ν_reference) / ν_reference * 1000 (in ppm).

So, for each proton, the resonance frequency is ν = ν0 + δ (in Hz, since ppm is parts per million). Wait, no: actually, δ is in ppm relative to ν0. So, ν_sample = ν0 (1 + δ/10^6).

But wait, the local magnetic field for each proton would be B_local = γ^-1 * (2π ν_sample). And since the external field H0 is applied, the local field is influenced by the shielding. Alternatively, the shielding σ is the fraction of the external field that the proton experiences. So, B_local = (1 - σ) * H0. But σ is related to the chemical shift: δ = (1 - σ) * (γ H0 / (2π)) * 1000 ppm.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me try a different approach.

The chemical shift in Hz can be calculated as Δν = δ (in ppm) * ν0, where ν0 is the reference frequency. ν0 is the resonance frequency of TMS in the given magnetic field.

Given that, for each proton, their resonance frequencies are ν_CH3 = ν0 + δ_CH3 * ν0 /1e6, and similarly ν_aldehyde = ν0 + δ_aldehyde * ν0 /1e6.

But wait, I think the formula is:

Δν = (δ) * ν0 / 1e6.

So, the difference in frequency between the two protons is Δν = (9.80 - 2.20) * ν0 /1e6 = 7.60 * ν0 /1e6.

Now, the difference in their local magnetic fields would be proportional to the difference in their resonance frequencies.

Because B_local is proportional to ν, as B_local = γ^-1 * 2π ν.

So, the difference in B_local is (Δν) * (γ H0)/(2π), since H0 is the external field. Wait, maybe I should express it differently.

Alternatively, since the Larmor frequency is ν = γ B/(2π), rearranged, B = (2π ν)/γ.

So, the difference in B between the two protons would be:

ΔB = (2π Δν) / γ.

Substituting Δν = (δ2 - δ1) * ν0 /1e6.

So, ΔB = (2π (δ2 - δ1) ν0 /1e6 ) / γ.

But what's ν0 here? ν0 is the resonance frequency of the reference (TMS) in the same magnetic field. So, ν0 = (γ H0)/(2π).

So, substituting ν0 into ΔB:

ΔB = (2π (δ2 - δ1) * [γ H0/(2π)] /1e6 ) / γ

Simplify this:

The 2π cancels out, and γ in the numerator and denominator cancels:

ΔB = ( (δ2 - δ1) * H0 ) / 1e6.

So, ΔB = (9.80 - 2.20) * 1.5 T / 1e6.

Wait, wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check:

Yes, because (δ2 - δ1) is 7.60 ppm. So,

ΔB = (7.60 ppm) * (1.5 T) / 1e6.

Wait, but ppm is parts per million, so 7.60 ppm is 7.60e-6.

So, 7.60e-6 * 1.5 T = 1.14e-5 T.

To convert Tesla to microtesla (μT), since 1 T = 1e6 μT,

1.14e-5 T = 1.14e-5 * 1e6 μT = 11.4 μT.

But wait, looking at the options, option E is 11 μT. But the calculation gives me approximately 11.4, which would round to 11, but I'm not sure if I missed a step.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the formula? Let me double-check.

Alternatively, another approach: the local magnetic field difference can be calculated using the formula:

ΔB = (δ2 - δ1) * γ * H0 / (2π) / 1e6.

Wait, but I think that's what I did earlier. Let me recalculate.

H0 is 1.5 T.

δ2 is 9.80, δ1 is 2.20, so their difference is 7.60 ppm.

So, 7.60 * 1.5 T = 11.4 T·ppm.

But wait, that doesn't make sense in terms of units. Oh wait, ppm is dimensionless, so it's 7.60e-6.

So, 7.60e-6 * 1.5 T = 1.14e-5 T.

Which is 11.4 μT.

But looking at the options, E is 11 μT, which is close. However, I might have missed a factor because in the formula, perhaps I should have used the shielding correctly.

Wait, another way: the chemical shift difference is 7.60 ppm, which corresponds to 7.60e-6 * 1.5 T = 1.14e-5 T, which is 11.4 μT. So the difference is approximately 11.4 μT, which is closest to option E (11 μT) and option J (15 μT). Hmm, but 11.4 is closer to 11 than 15.

So, the answer should be E: 11 μT.
</think>

The chemical shift difference between the CH₃ and CHO protons in acetaldehyde is 7.60 ppm. Using the formula for the difference in local magnetic field, ΔB = (δ₂ - δ₁) × H₀ / 1e6, where H₀ = 1.5 T, we calculate:

ΔB = 7.60 × 1.5 / 1e6 = 11.4 μT. This rounds to 11 μT, corresponding to option E.
