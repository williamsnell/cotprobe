Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the frequencies of different genotypes based on the given gene frequency for a dominant trait, which is widow's peak.

First, I remember that in genetics, the Hardy-Weinberg principle is used to calculate genotype frequencies. The basic formula is p² + 2pq + q² = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. But wait, in this case, the trait is dominant, and the given frequency is 0.07. Hmm, wait, wait. I think I might have mixed up something here. Oh right! The frequency given is the frequency of the dominant allele, not the phenotype. Or wait, no, the question says the frequency of the gene for widow's peak, a dominant trait, is 0.07. So I'm assuming that the frequency of the dominant allele (let's say 'A') is 0.07, and the recessive allele ('a') would be q = 1 - p. Wait, no, wait. Wait a second, actually, I think I might have this wrong. Because usually, the frequency of the dominant allele is p, and the recessive is q, with p + q = 1. But I have to make sure whether the given 0.07 is p or q. Wait, but wait, the problem states that the gene for widow's peak is a dominant trait, so the dominant allele (A) is present, and the recessive (a) would be the one without it. So if the frequency of the dominant allele is 0.07, then p = 0.07, and q = 1 - 0.07 = 0.93.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if the dominant allele is so rare, like 7%, then the recessive would be 93%. That would mean that most people would be homozygous recessive (aa), and the dominant phenotype would be rare. But let me think again. Oh, wait, no, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Because in some cases, the given frequency might refer to the phenotype, not the allele. Wait, no, the question says the frequency of the gene (allele) for widow's peak is 0.07, so it's definitely the allele frequency. So p = 0.07, q = 0.93.

Wait, but wait, that seems counterintuitive because if the dominant allele is only 7%, then the dominant phenotype would be even rarer, as only AA and Aa would show it. But I'll go with this for now.

So, using the Hardy-Weinberg equation:

p² + 2pq + q² = 1.

We can calculate the genotype frequencies.

(a) Persons homozygous for widow's peak would be AA, which is p².

So p² = (0.07)^2 = 0.0049.

(b) Persons heterozygous would be Aa, which is 2pq.

So 2pq = 2 * 0.07 * 0.93 = 2 * 0.0651 = 0.1302.

(c) Persons lacking widow's peak would be aa, which is q².

q² = (0.93)^2 = 0.8649.

Now, looking at the options, I need to match these numbers.

Option C: (a) 0.0049, (b) 0.1302, (c) 0.8649. That matches exactly what I calculated.

Wait, but let me check the other options to be sure.

Option A: (a) 0.0059, which is higher than 0.0049, so probably not.

Option B: (a) 0.0021, too low.

Option C matches, so that's correct. The other options either have wrong values for (a) or (b) or (c). For example, option F has (a) 0.0045 which is close but not exact. Option E has (a) 0.0081, which is higher than our calculation. So yeah, option C must be the right answer.
</think>

The frequency of the dominant allele (p) is given as 0.07. Using the Hardy-Weinberg principle, we calculate the genotype frequencies as follows:

(a) Homozygous dominant (AA): \( p^2 = (0.07)^2 = 0.0049 \)

(b) Heterozygous (Aa): \( 2pq = 2 \times 0.07 \times (1 - 0.07) = 2 \times 0.07 \times 0.93 = 0.1302 \)

(c) Homozygous recessive (aa): \( q^2 = (1 - 0.07)^2 = (0.93)^2 = 0.8649 \)

Comparing these values with the options, option C matches exactly.

Answer: C
