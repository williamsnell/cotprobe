Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Stevenson's view on moral disagreements. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that Stevenson was a philosopher who talked about ethics and moral disagreements. From what I recall, he focused a lot on how people's moral disagreements don't necessarily stem from fundamental differences in deep principles but more from other factors.

Looking at the options, I need to pick which one fits what Stevenson said. The options are A through J, each suggesting a different kind of disagreement.

Option A is disagreement in principles. Principles sound like foundational rules or beliefs. If Stevenson thought disagreements were about principles, that would mean people have different core beliefs, but I think he believed it's more about other things like attitudes or perceptions.

Option B is disagreement in understanding. That could be about how people comprehend something, but I'm not sure if that's what Stevenson focused on.

Option C is disagreement in experience. Experience is about personal feelings or observations. Stevenson might have considered this, but I'm not certain if it's his main point.

Option D is disagreement in practice. Practice refers to actions or behavior. If people disagree in practice, it might be about what they do, but I think Stevenson was more about the reasons behind actions rather than the actions themselves.

Option E is disagreement in interest. Interests relate to what benefits people. Stevenson might have discussed this, but I'm not sure if that's the primary disagreement he talked about.

Option F is disagreement in theory. Theory is similar to principles, more about abstract concepts. So maybe not the main focus for Stevenson.

Option G is disagreement in attitude. Attitudes are about feelings or dispositions. Stevenson's theory, as I remember, was that moral disagreements often arise from differing attitudes or emotional responses rather than deep-seated principles. He talked about how people might use language to evoke emotions in others, which ties into attitudes.

Option H is disagreement in perception. Perception is about how we see or interpret things. Stevenson might have touched on this, but I think he emphasized attitudes more than perceptions.

Option I is disagreement in belief. Beliefs are like principles, so this might not be what Stevenson focused on.

Option J is disagreement in values. Values are what people find important. If they disagree in values, that could be a reason, but Stevenson's approach was more about the emotional and linguistic aspects rather than the values themselves.

Putting this together, Stevenson's view, as I understand it, is that moral disagreements often stem from differences in attitudes or how people feel about something, rather than from conflicting principles or beliefs. So the correct answer should be G: disagreement in attitude.

The correct answer is G: disagreement in attitude.
