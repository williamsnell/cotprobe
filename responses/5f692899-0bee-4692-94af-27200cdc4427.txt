Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about competing reactions, and I need to figure out the ratio of the products at a given time t. The reactions are all starting with NH2 and reacting with different nitrogen species, Na, Nb, and Nc, each with their own rate constants ka, kb, and kc. The rate constants given are ka = 0.57, kb = 0.24, and kc = 0.19.

The reactions are:
1. NH2 + Na → H2 + N2
2. NH2 + Nb → 2NH
3. NH2 + Nc → N2H + H

I need to determine the products' ratio. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on reaction kinetics, but I think this involves the rate constants determining which reaction happens more quickly, which would influence the product ratios.

Wait, but how do the rate constants relate to the products' ratios? I remember that in competing reactions, the product ratios depend on the relative rates of each reaction. But I'm not exactly sure about the formula here.

Let me think. Each reaction has a rate proportional to its rate constant. So the overall rate for each product would be based on their respective k values. But since all reactions are starting with the same reactant, NH2, perhaps the amount of each product formed depends on how fast each reaction proceeds.

Alternatively, maybe the ratio of the products is determined by the ratio of the rate constants. So if reaction 1 has a higher ka, it would produce more product 1 relative to others. But wait, the options are given as triplets, each representing the ratios of the three products.

Wait, the question says "determine the products' ratio at time t." So it's the ratio of the amounts of each product formed, which would be proportional to the rate constants, assuming that each reaction's rate contributes to the formation of that product.

Wait, but I'm not sure if it's directly proportional. I think for a single reactant undergoing multiple reactions, the mole ratios depend on the relative rates. The formula I recall is that the ratio of the products is equal to the ratio of their rate constants if they start with the same initial concentration and proceed to completion. But in this case, it's at time t, not at completion, so maybe it's the same ratio because the initial rates determine the proportions.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is determined by the relative rate constants. So, the product from reaction a (H2 + N2) will have a rate proportional to ka, reaction b (2NH) proportional to kb, and reaction c (N2H + H) proportional to kc.

Wait, but the problem is about the ratio of the products, not the rate. So if the reactions are independent and each goes to completion, the mole ratio would be ka : kb : kc. But since they are competing, perhaps the ratio is the same as the rate constants.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (0.57, 0.24, 0.19), which matches the ka, kb, kc given. So that's an option. But wait, I'm not entirely sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe each product's amount is proportional to the reciprocal of the rate constants? No, that doesn't make sense because higher rate constants should lead to more product.

Wait, perhaps the rate of each reaction is given by their rate constants, and since each reaction consumes NH2, the amount of each product formed would be proportional to the rate constants. So the ratio of the products would be ka : kb : kc.

In that case, the ratio would be 0.57 : 0.24 : 0.19. Looking at the options, option C is (0.57, 0.24, 0.19), which matches exactly.

But wait, another thought: perhaps each reaction's rate is k multiplied by the concentration of NH2 and the other reactant. But since all three reactions are happening simultaneously, the overall rate depends on their individual rates. But without knowing the concentrations of Na, Nb, Nc, it's assumed they are the same? Or perhaps the problem treats them as present in such a way that their concentrations don't affect the ratio. So the ratio is just ka : kb : kc.

So the product ratio should be in the same order as the rate constants. So the first product (from ka) would be the largest, then kb, then kc. So the ratio would be 0.57 : 0.24 : 0.19, which is exactly option C.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (0.57, 0.24, 0.19). So the product ratio would be in that order.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the ratio of the products in the order of the reactions, so product 1, product 2, product 3. So their ratios would be ka/kb, kb/kc, etc. No, that's not the case. The product ratios would each be determined by their own rate constants.

So I think the correct answer is option C.

The problem involves determining the ratio of products formed by three competing reactions, where the rate constants are given as \( k_a = 0.57 \), \( k_b = 0.24 \), and \( k_c = 0.19 \). Since the reactions are independent and proceed simultaneously, the ratio of the products formed is directly proportional to the rate constants. Therefore, the product ratio at time \( t \) is \( k_a : k_b : k_c \), which corresponds to \( 0.57 : 0.24 : 0.19 \). This matches option C.
