Question:

A man owned a piece of land with a run-down log cabin on it. He lost interest in it, letting tax bills pile up and failing to maintain it. In 1990, a homeless couple occupied the crumbling cabin. They restored it, fenced the perimeter, and maintained the grounds. They started paying the taxes, despite knowing there was an absentee owner. In 2000, the owner appeared and demanded that they pay rent. They agreed but stopped the payments two years later after consulting an attorney. The required statutory period in the state is 20 years. In 2011 the owner filed an ejectment action, asserting his ownership rights. Leaving aside any other theories or equities, can the couple prevail on a theory of adverse possession?

Options:

A: No, because the statutory period had not been met when the owner filed for ejectment.
B: Yes, because they maintained the grounds of the property.
C: Yes, because they had exclusive possession of the property.
D: Yes, because they were on the land for over 20 years.
E: Yes, because they owned the property due to paying the taxes on it.
F: No, because they missed some of the tax payments during that 20-year period.
G: No, because they knew there was an absentee owner.
H: Yes, because they made improvements to the property.
I: No, because the hostile possession was interrupted for two years when they paid rent.
J: No, because they did not have a legal claim to the property.

Okay, so I have this question about adverse possession. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

Alright, the scenario is about a man who owns a piece of land with a run-down cabin. He stopped taking care of it, didn't pay taxes, and basically lost interest. Then, in 1990, a homeless couple moved in. They fixed up the cabin, fenced it, and started taking care of the place. They also started paying the taxes even though they knew the owner wasn't living there. 

In 2000, the owner comes back and asks them to pay rent. They agree, but two years later after talking to a lawyer, they stop paying. So, in 2011, the owner sues them to evict them, claiming ownership.

The question is whether the couple can win by adverse possession. The options are A to J, and the required statutory period is 20 years. So, let's think about the elements of adverse possession.

Adverse possession typically requires that the person has been in continuous, open, and hostile possession of the property for the statutory period. Also, they must pay the taxes if required by state law.

In this case, the couple moved in in 1990, so by 2010, that's 20 years. They were maintaining the property, paying taxes, and using it as their home. But wait, in 2000, the owner asked them to pay rent, and they agreed. So, from 2000 to 2002, they were paying rent, which means they weren't in adverse possession during that time because they had a lease. 

The statutory period is 20 years, and the owner filed in 2011. So, the couple's possession was from 1990 to 2011. But the problem is the two-year period when they paid rent. Adverse possession requires uninterrupted possession. If they were paying rent, that interrupts the adverse possession because it's no longer hostileâ€”they're paying the owner for the use. So, that two-year period would break the continuity needed for adverse possession.

Looking at the options, option I says no because the hostile possession was interrupted for two years. That makes sense because during those two years, they weren't adverse; they were tenants. So, the period of adverse possession isn't continuous. Therefore, they wouldn't meet the statutory period's requirements.

Another point is that some states require that the possession be without permission. If they agreed to pay rent, that's with permission, so it's not hostile. So, the time they paid rent doesn't count towards adverse possession.

Option A says no because the statutory period hadn't been met when the owner filed. Wait, the owner filed in 2011, and the couple had been there since 1990. From 1990 to 2010 is 20 years, so by 2010, they would have met the period. But because they had that two-year interruption, their continuous possession is less than 20 years. So, the period from 1990 to 2000 is 10 years, then from 2002 to 2011 is another 9 years. So total is 19 years, which is less than 20. Wait, no, because 2000 to 2002 is two years. So, from 1990 to 2000 is 10 years, then from 2002 to 2011 is 9 years. Total is 19. So, they didn't meet the full 20 years. But wait, the rent period was from 2000 to 2002, which is two years. So, 2000-2002 is two years, so from 1990 to 2000 is 10, then 2002 to 2011 is 9. So total is 19, which is one year short. But wait, maybe the period is counted from when they stopped paying rent. Hmm, but the key is the interruption.

So, the couple's possession was interrupted by the two-year lease. Because of that, their adverse possession period is broken. So, they can't claim adverse possession because the required continuous period wasn't met.

So, the correct answer should be I: No, because the hostile possession was interrupted for two years when they paid rent.

The couple cannot prevail on a theory of adverse possession because their possession was interrupted for two years when they paid rent, breaking the continuity required for adverse possession.
