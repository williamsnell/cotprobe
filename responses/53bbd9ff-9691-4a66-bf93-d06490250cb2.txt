Okay, so I need to figure out who was the first American in space. The options are A through J, and I have to pick the correct one. Let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that the first person in space was Yuri Gagarin from the Soviet Union. But the question is about the first American. So I can probably eliminate B, which is Yuri Gagarin, because he wasn't American.

Now, I need to recall the names of the early American astronauts. I know that Alan Shepard was one of the first astronauts. I think he was the first American in space, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me go through the other options to confirm.

Option A is Buzz Aldrin. He was an astronaut, but I think he was part of the Apollo missions, maybe the second man on the moon. So probably not the first in space.

Option C is Pete Conrad. He was also an astronaut, maybe on later missions, perhaps Apollo. Not the first.

Option D is Neil Armstrong, the first man on the moon. He was in the Apollo 11 mission, so definitely not the first in space.

Option E is Jim Lovell, another Apollo astronaut, part of the Apollo 8 and 13 missions. Not the first.

Option F is Gus Grissom. He was an early astronaut, one of the Mercury Seven. I think he went up in the second Mercury mission, but was there an incident with his capsule? Maybe it sank after a water landing. But I'm not sure if he was the first.

Option G is Scott Carpenter, another Mercury astronaut. I think he was part of the early missions but after Alan Shepard.

Option H is John Glenn, who was the first American to orbit the Earth. Wait, orbiting is different from just being in space. So John Glenn was first in orbit, but not necessarily the first in space. The first American in space might have been before that.

Option I is Michael Collins, another Apollo astronaut, known for staying in the command module during the moon landing. Not the first.

So, going back, the first American in space was probably Alan Shepard. He was part of the Mercury program. His flight was in 1961, right? I think that's before John Glenn's orbital flight. Wait, no, John Glenn's orbital flight was also in 1962. So Alan Shepard's flight was in May 1961, suborbital, while John Glenn was the first to orbit the Earth in February 1962.

So the first American in space would be Alan Shepard, option J. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes people refer to John Glenn as the first American in space, but I think it's actually Alan Shepard because he was the first to be launched into space, even though it wasn't orbit.

Wait, another thought: the Soviets had Yuri Gagarin in April 1961, then the Americans followed with Alan Shepard in May, and then John Glenn in 1962. So yes, Alan Shepard was the first American in space, even if it was a suborbital flight.

So the correct answer should be J: Alan Shepard.
