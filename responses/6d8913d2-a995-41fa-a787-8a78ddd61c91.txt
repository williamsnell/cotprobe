Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about carbohydrates, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says there's a carbohydrate that's slightly soluble in water, doesn't taste sweet, and dissolves slowly when heated with dilute HCl. I need to determine which class of carbohydrates it belongs to, with options from A to J.

First, I'll break down the properties mentioned and think about each one in relation to the types of carbohydrates.

1. **Slightly soluble in water**: Carbohydrates can be classified into sugars and non-sugars. Sugars like monosaccharides (glucose, fructose) and disaccharides (like sucrose) are usually more soluble. However, the question says it's only slightly soluble, which might suggest it's not a simple sugar. Maybe it's a more complex carbohydrate.

2. **Does not have a sweet taste**: Most monosaccharides and disaccharides are sweet. For example, glucose is sweet, as is sucrose. If it's not sweet, perhaps it's a polysaccharide, which are generally not sweet. Examples include starch, cellulose, and glycogen.

3. **Dissolves slowly when heated with dilute HCl**: Heating with acid usually refers to the hydrolysis of certain bonds. Monosaccharides don't need such treatment; they're already broken down. Disaccharides can be broken down by acid into monosaccharides. Polysaccharides, on the other hand, require more vigorous conditions to break down into smaller units. But the question says it dissolves slowly, which might imply that it's breaking down into smaller pieces under those conditions.

Looking at the options:

A: Pentoses are a type of monosaccharide with five carbons. They are usually water-soluble and sweet. Doesn't fit since the substance isn't sweet.

B: Disaccharides are sugars made of two monosaccharides. They are sweet and usually more soluble. The question says it's slightly soluble, so maybe not this.

C: Polysaccharides are long chains. They are less soluble, not sweet, and might require more processing to dissolve. But the question says it dissolves when heated with HCl, which could be the case for some polysaccharides as they start to break down.

D: Lipids aren't carbohydrates, so that's out.

E: Oligosaccharides are short chains, longer than disaccharides but shorter than polysaccharides. They might be less sweet than disaccharides but more than polysaccharides. Not sure, but the question says it's not sweet, so maybe not.

F: Amino acids aren't carbs, so no.

G: Proteins aren't carbs either.

H: Monosaccharides are sweet and usually more soluble. Since the substance isn't sweet and only slightly soluble, this seems unlikely.

So, putting it together, the substance is a carbohydrate that's not sweet, only slightly soluble, and dissolves when heated with dilute HCl. That points towards a polysaccharide. Starch, for example, is a polysaccharide. It's not sweet, but when heated with acid (like HCl), it can start to hydrolyze, though it might take time. Alternatively, maybe it's a different type of polysaccharide.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the solubility. Polysaccharides are generally less soluble than monosaccharides or disaccharides. So if it's slightly soluble, that fits. Also, since it doesn't dissolve quickly without heating, perhaps it's a polysaccharide that requires some processing to break down.

Another angle: when you add dilute HCl and heat, you're probably causing some kind of acid hydrolysis. For polysaccharides, this would break them down into shorter chains or monosaccharides. So if the substance starts dissolving as it breaks down, that might fit.

So, considering all this, the answer is likely C: Polysaccharides.

The carbohydrate in question is slightly soluble in water, not sweet, and dissolves slowly when heated with dilute HCl. These properties suggest it is a polysaccharide, which are typically less soluble, non-sweet, and require hydrolysis under acidic conditions to break down. 

Answer: C
