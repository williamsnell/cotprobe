Okay, so I have this ratio problem to solve. The question is asking which ratios are equal to 4:32. There are four options, A through D, each with two ratios. I need to figure out which option has both ratios equivalent to 4:32.

First, I should simplify the given ratio, 4:32. To do that, I can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor. Let's see, 4 divides into both 4 and 32. 4 divided by 4 is 1, and 32 divided by 4 is 8. So, 4:32 simplifies to 1:8. That's the simplest form of the ratio.

Now, I'll go through each option and check if both of their ratios simplify to 1:8.

Starting with Option A: 2:96 and 2:16.

Let's simplify 2:96 first. Dividing both by 2, we get 1:48. Hmm, that's not 1:8, so this ratio isn't equal to 4:32. Now, the second ratio in A is 2:16. Dividing both by 2 gives 1:8. Oh, that one works. But since the first ratio in A isn't equal, option A can't be the correct answer.

Moving on to Option B: 12:96 and 12:16.

Simplifying 12:96: both numbers can be divided by 12. 12 รท12 is 1, and 96 รท12 is 8. So that's 1:8, which matches. Now the second ratio is 12:16. Let's simplify that. Both can be divided by 4, giving 3:4. That's not 1:8, so the second ratio in B doesn't work. Therefore, B isn't the right option.

Next is Option C: 2:96 and 12:16.

We've already simplified 2:96 earlier, which was 1:48, not equal to 1:8. The second ratio here is 12:16, which simplifies to 3:4, as before. Neither of these ratios is equal to 1:8, so C is out.

Finally, Option D: 12:96 and 2:16.

Let's check both. The first ratio, 12:96, simplifies to 1:8 when divided by 12. That's good. The second ratio is 2:16. Dividing both by 2 gives 1:8. Oh, both ratios in D simplify to 1:8, so they are both equal to 4:32. That must be the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For D, 12:96 รท12 is 1:8, and 2:16 รท2 is 1:8. Yep, both correct. So D is the right choice.

The correct answer is D: 12 : 96; 2 : 16.

Answer: D
