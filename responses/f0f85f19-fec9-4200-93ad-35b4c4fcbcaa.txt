Okay, so I've got this question about translating an English sentence into predicate logic. The sentence is "Some firefighters rescue victims from danger." I'm a bit new to this, so I need to take it step by step.

First, let me break down the sentence. The main parts are:

- Some firefighters: So, there exists at least one firefighter.
- Rescue: This is the action, so it's a verb that needs to be represented as a predicate.
- Victims: These are the things being rescued, so they'll be the objects.
- From danger: This indicates that the rescue is happening from a dangerous situation, so 'danger' is the source.

Looking at the predicates given:

Dx: x is danger
Fx: x is a firefighter
Vx: x is a victim
Rxyz: x rescues y from z

So, the structure is that a firefighter (Fx) rescues (R) a victim (Vy) from danger (Dz). So the R predicate takes three arguments: the rescuer, the victim, and the danger.

Now, the sentence is about some firefighters, so I think this is an existential statement. It's not saying all firefighters do this, just that some do. So the translation should start with an existential quantifier for x, meaning there exists an x such that x is a firefighter and... something.

So the structure would be: There exists an x such that Fx and for some y and z, Vy and Dz, and x rescues y from z.

Wait, but the way the sentence is phrased, it's "some firefighters rescue victims from danger." So, each firefighter in the group rescues some victims from danger. Or maybe each firefighter rescues some victims from each danger? Hmm, that might complicate things.

Wait, the sentence is a bit ambiguous. Let me think. "Some firefighters rescue victims from danger." So, there exists at least one firefighter, and that firefighter rescues some victims from some danger. Alternatively, it could mean that each firefighter rescues some victims from some danger. But the way it's phrased, I think it's the first: there exists at least one firefighter who rescues some victims from some danger.

So, the structure would be: ∃x (Fx ∧ ∃y (Vy ∧ ∃z (Dz ∧ Rxyz)))

Looking at the options, that's a combination of an existential quantifier for x, then for y and z. Let me check the options.

Option E is: (∃x){Fx • (∀y)[Vy ⊃ (∃z)(Dz • Rxyz)]}

Wait, that's not quite right. The Vy is in a universal, which might not fit. Because the original sentence doesn't say that for all victims, they are rescued from danger by the firefighter. It's just that some victims are rescued from some danger.

Option H is: (∃x){Fx • (∃y)[Dy • (∃z)(Vz • Rxyz)]}

Wait, that's not right because Vy should be for the victim, not Dy. Dy is danger, so I think that's mixed up.

Option I: (∃x){Fx • (∃y)[Dy • (∃z)(Vz • Rxyz)]}

No, same issue as H. Dy is danger, but the victim is Vy.

Option E: Let's look again. E is (∃x){Fx • (∀y)[Vy ⊃ (∃z)(Dz • Rxyz)]}

So, it's saying there exists an x (firefighter) such that for all y, if y is a victim, then there exists a z where z is danger and x rescues y from z. But the original sentence doesn't say that every victim is rescued; it's just that some victims are rescued from danger by some firefighter.

So E might be too strong because it requires that every victim is rescued from some danger by the same firefighter, which isn't what the sentence says.

Option H is (∃x){Fx • (∃y)[Dy • (∃z)(Vz • Rxyz)]}

Wait, no, that's not right because Dy is danger, but the victim is Vy. So in Rxyz, x is the firefighter, y is the victim, z is the danger. So the correct structure should involve Vy, not Dy.

Looking at option H again: (∃x){Fx • (∃y)[Dy • (∃z)(Vz • Rxyz)]} Wait, that can't be right because the innermost is Vy? Or is it Dy? Wait, in the option, it's Dy, which is danger, but the victim is Vy. So perhaps the option is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me re-examine each option carefully.

Option A: (∀x){Fx ⊃ (∃y)[Vy . (∃z)(Dz • Rxyz)]}

This is for all x, if x is a firefighter, then there exists y (a victim) and z (danger) such that x rescues y from z. So this would mean that every firefighter rescues at least one victim from some danger. But the original sentence is about some firefighters, not all. So A is using a universal quantifier for x, which might not be correct.

Option B: (∃x){Fx • (∀y)[Dy ⊃ (∃z)(Vz • Rxyz)]}

Hmm, this says there exists an x who is a firefighter, and for all y, if y is danger, then there exists z (a victim) such that x rescues z from y. But that doesn't make sense because the victim should be y, not z. Also, the original statement is about rescuing victims from danger, not rescuing dangers from something.

Option C: (∀x){Fx ⊃ (∃y)[Dy . (∃z)(Vz • Rxyz)]}

Again, a universal for x, and inside, Dy is danger, but the structure seems off. Not sure.

Option D: (∃x){Fx • (∀y)[Vy ⊃ (∀z)(Dz • Rxyz)]}

This says there exists an x (firefighter) such that for all y, if y is a victim, then for all z, if z is danger, Rxyz holds. So this would mean that the same firefighter rescues every victim from every danger. That's too strong and probably incorrect.

Option E: (∃x){Fx • (∀y)[Vy ⊃ (∃z)(Dz • Rxyz)]}

So, there exists an x (firefighter) such that for every victim y, there exists a danger z where x rescues y from z. This means that the same firefighter rescues every victim from some danger. But the original sentence says "some firefighters rescue victims from danger," which could mean that each firefighter rescues some victims from some danger, not necessarily all victims.

So E might be overreaching because it's saying that for every victim, the same firefighter rescues them, which isn't what the sentence says.

Option F: (∀x){Fx ⊃ (∀y)[Vy ⊃ (∃z)(Dz • Rxyz)]}

Universal quantifier for x, so every firefighter. For every victim y, there exists z (danger) such that x rescues y from z. Again, too strong because it's for all firefighters and all victims.

Option G: (∃x){Fx • (∃y)[Dy • (∃z)(Vz • Rxyz)]}

So, x is a firefighter, y is danger, z is a victim. So x rescues z from y. But the sentence is about rescuing victims from danger, so the victim should be y, and danger z. So the structure is Rxyz where y is victim, z is danger. So in G, it's rescuing z (a victim) from y (danger), which is the reverse of what we need. So G is incorrect.

Option H: (∃x){Fx • (∃y)[Vy • (∃z)(Dz • Rxyz)]}

Yes! Here, x is a firefighter, y is a victim, z is danger. So x rescues y from z. So it's saying there exists a firefighter, a victim, and a danger such that the firefighter rescues the victim from the danger. That seems to fit the original sentence, which is about some firefighters rescuing some victims from some danger.

Wait, but the sentence is "Some firefighters rescue victims from danger." So it's an existential statement about the firefighters, and for each firefighter, they rescue some victims from some danger. So the correct translation should be that there exists at least one firefighter, and for that firefighter, there exists at least one victim and at least one danger such that the firefighter rescues the victim from the danger.

So H is: (∃x){Fx • (∃y)[Vy • (∃z)(Dz • Rxyz)]}

Yes, that looks correct. Let me double-check the other options.

Option I: (∃x){Fx • (∃y)[Dy • (∃z)(Vz • Rxyz)]}

Wait, here y is Dy (danger), but Rxyz would mean x rescues y (danger) from z (victim), which is not correct because the victim should be y, not z. So I is incorrect.

Option J: (∃x){Fx • (∃y)(∃z)[(Vy • Dz) • Rxzy]}

Here, Vy and Dz are both properties, and Rxzy would mean x rescues z from y. But the victim should be y and danger z, so Rxyz. So J has Rxyz as Rzxy (if I'm reading it right), which is rescuing z from y, but z is a victim and y is danger, which is the opposite. So J is incorrect.

So, going back, the correct structure is in option H: There exists an x (firefighter) such that there exists a y (victim) and a z (danger) where x rescues y from z. So H is the correct translation.
</think>

The correct translation captures the existential nature of the sentence, stating that there exists at least one firefighter who rescues a victim from danger. Option H accurately represents this by using existential quantifiers for the firefighter, victim, and danger, ensuring the structure aligns with the original sentence.

Answer: H
