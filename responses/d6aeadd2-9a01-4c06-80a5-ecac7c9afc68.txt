Okay, so I've got this question about how much area one liter of paint can cover when it's applied to a thickness of 100 microns. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my units, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that the area covered by paint depends on its volume and the thickness when applied. The formula that comes to mind is Area = Volume / Thickness. That makes sense because if you spread the same volume thinner, the area covered would be larger, and vice versa.

So, the volume here is one liter. I know that 1 liter is equal to 0.001 cubic meters because 1 m³ is 1000 liters. So, 1 liter is 1e-3 m³ or 0.001 m³.

Next, the thickness is given as 100 microns. Wait, microns are micrometers, right? So, 100 micrometers. I need to convert that into meters because the volume is in cubic meters. 

I recall that 1 meter is 1e6 micrometers. So, 100 micrometers is 100 / 1e6 meters, which is 1e-4 meters. Let me double-check that: 1e6 micrometers per meter, so 100 divided by 1e6 is 0.0001 meters, which is 1e-4 m. Yep, that's correct.

Now, plugging the numbers into the formula: Area = Volume / Thickness. 

So, Area = 0.001 m³ / 0.0001 m. Let's compute that. 

0.001 divided by 0.0001. Hmm, 0.001 is 1e-3, and 0.0001 is 1e-4. So, dividing 1e-3 by 1e-4 is the same as 1e-3 * 1e4, which is 1e1, or 10. 

Wait, that gives me 10 m². Looking at the options, F is 10 m². So that should be the answer.

But wait, am I missing something? Let me think again. Maybe I confused the units somewhere. Let me go through it again.

Volume is 1 liter = 0.001 m³. Thickness is 100 microns = 100e-6 meters = 1e-4 meters. So, area is 0.001 / 1e-4 = 0.001 / 0.0001 = 10. Yep, that seems right.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. So the answer should be F: 10 m².

The area covered by one liter of paint with a thickness of 100 microns is calculated by dividing the volume of the paint by its thickness. Converting the units appropriately gives an area of 10 square meters.

Answer: F
