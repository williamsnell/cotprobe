Question:

A valid disjunctive syllogism has a major premise that:

Options:

A: affirms the antecedent or denies the consequent
B: leads to an invalid conclusion
C: generalizes a specific case
D: includes three or more alternatives
E: contradicts the conclusion
F: includes two or more alternatives
G: leads to a valid conclusion
H: is based on a false premise
I: denies the antecedent or affirms the consequent
J: classifies subjects

Answer:

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this logic question about disjunctive syllogisms. I'm a bit rusty on my logic terms, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, the question is asking about the major premise of a valid disjunctive syllogism. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

I remember that syllogisms are a form of logical reasoning where you have two premises and a conclusion. A disjunctive syllogism specifically deals with 'or' statements, which are called disjuncts. So, the major premise in a disjunctive syllogism would be a statement that presents two or more alternatives, I think.

Let me recall the structure. A disjunctive syllogism typically looks like this:

1. Either P or Q (this is the major premise)
2. Not P (the minor premise)
3. Therefore, Q (the conclusion)

Alternatively, it could be:

1. Either P or Q
2. P
3. Therefore, Not Q

So the major premise here is the one with the 'or' statement, presenting two possibilities. That makes me think that the major premise includes two or more alternatives. Looking at the options, option F says "includes two or more alternatives," which seems to fit.

Wait, but let me make sure. Option D says "includes three or more alternatives." Well, the standard disjunctive syllogism usually has two alternatives, but I guess it could have more. However, the key is that it's a disjunction, which is typically two or more. So option F is about two or more, which is correct, while option D is about three or more, which is a subset of F. So F is more accurate.

Option A talks about affirming the antecedent or denying the consequent. That sounds more like different types of syllogisms, maybe hypothetical syllogisms, not disjunctive. Similarly, option I mentions denying the antecedent or affirming the consequent, which I think are different rules, possibly invalid ones.

Option G says the major premise leads to a valid conclusion. Well, the question is about what the major premise is, not necessarily the conclusion. So G is about the result, not the structure.

Option E says the premise contradicts the conclusion. That doesn't sound right because a valid syllogism shouldn't have a conclusion that contradicts the premises.

Option H is about a false premise. That's more about the truth of the premise, not its structure.

Option C says it generalizes a specific case. That doesn't seem related; that's more about inductive reasoning.

Option J is about classifying subjects, which might relate to categorical syllogisms, not disjunctive.

So, putting it all together, the major premise in a disjunctive syllogism presents two or more alternatives connected by 'or.' Therefore, the correct answer should be option F.

The major premise of a valid disjunctive syllogism presents two or more alternatives connected by 'or.' This structure allows the syllogism to eliminate one alternative and conclude the other. Among the options, F correctly identifies this characteristic.

Answer: F
