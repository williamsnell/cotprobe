Okay, so I have this genetics problem here about red-green color blindness. I remember that red-green color blindness is a sex-linked recessive trait, usually located on the X chromosome. Let me try to work through this step by step.

The question says a red-green color-blind man marries a woman with normal vision, but her father was color blind. I need to figure out what the expected phenotypic results are for their children.

First, let me break down the parents' genotypes.

The man is color blind. Since it's a recessive trait and it's on the X chromosome, his genotype must be XbY. Because males have XY, so they get their X from the mother and Y from the father. So if he's color blind, his X must carry the recessive allele (Xb), and his Y can't carry it because it's a different chromosome.

The woman has normal vision. But her father was color blind. Wait, her father's genotype would be XbY, so he can only pass his Xb to daughters and Y to sons. So the woman's father gave her his Xb, which makes her a carrier if her mother didn't give her a normal X. Wait, but the woman has normal vision. Hmm.

So the woman's genotype: since her father was XbY, she must have received his Xb. Her mother must have given her an X from her. But the mother has normal vision, so she must have given her an X with a normal allele. So the woman's genotype is XBXb. She's a carrier because she has one normal X (XB) and one recessive X (Xb).

Wait no, wait: the woman has normal vision, so her phenotype is normal. But her father was color blind, so she must have inherited his Xb from him. Her mother has normal vision, so she must have given her an XB. So the woman's genotype is XBXb, meaning she's a carrier.

Wait no, wait again. If a man is color blind, his X is Xb, and the Y is from the father. The man's genotype is XbY. So the woman, whose father is XbY, must have received Xb from her father. Her mother must have given her an XB, so she's XBXb. So she's a carrier.

Now, the man is XbY (color blind), and the woman is XBXb (carrier, normal vision).

Let me think about their possible offspring.

When a man with XbY (color blind) marries a woman who is XBXb (carrier), what do their children look like?

Let's draw a Punnett square.

The man's gametes: since he has Xb and Y. So he can produce two types of gametes: Xb (from the X) and Y (from the Y). Each with 50% chance.

The woman's genotype is XBXb. So she has two X chromosomes: one XB and one Xb. So her gametes are either XB or Xb, each with 50% chance.

So the cross is XBXb (woman) and XbY (man).

Let's set up the Punnett square.

The woman's gametes: XB (50%) and Xb (50%).

The man's gametes: Xb (50%) and Y (50%).

So the possible combinations are:

1. XB (woman) + Xb (man): XBXb (girl)
2. XB (woman) + Y (man): XBY (boy)
3. Xb (woman) + Xb (man): XbXb (girl)
4. Xb (woman) + Y (man): XbY (boy)

Each of these four possibilities is equally likely, so each is 25% probability.

Now, let's determine the phenotypes for each.

For the girls:
- XBXb: since it's a dominant trait, they'll have normal vision. But wait, XBXb is a carrier, so phenotypically normal.
- XbXb: both Xs have the recessive allele, so they'll be color blind.

For the boys:
- XBY: since they have at least one dominant allele (XB), they'll have normal vision.
- XbY: they have the recessive allele, so they'll be color blind.

Wait, but wait: the man's gametes are Xb and Y, so the possible children are:

Each child's X from the mother and either Xb or Y from the father.

So:

Daughters:

- From father's Xb and mother's XB: XBXb (carrier, normal vision)
- From father's Xb and mother's Xb: XbXb (color blind)

Sons:

- From father's Y and mother's XB: XBY (normal)
- From father's Y and mother's Xb: XbY (color blind)

So the possible children are:

- 25% XBXb (daughter, normal)
- 25% XbXb (daughter, color blind)
- 25% XBY (son, normal)
- 25% XbY (son, color blind)

So in terms of phenotypes, the daughters have a 50% chance of being normal (XBXb) and 50% color blind (XbXb). The sons have a 50% chance of being normal (XBY) and 50% color blind (XbY).

So looking at the options:

Option C says: Half of the females, normal vision; half of the females, color blind; all males, normal vision.

Wait, but according to my analysis, sons have a 50% chance of being color blind. So the sons are not all normal. So option C would be incorrect because it says all males are normal.

Wait, looking back, the options:

Option C: Half females normal, half color blind; all males normal.

But according to the Punnett square, 50% of sons are normal, 50% are color blind. So that's not what option C says.

Looking again at the options. Let me check all options.

Option E: All females, carrier with normal vision; all males, color blind. No, because some daughters are color blind (XbXb), and some sons are normal.

Option G: All females, normal vision; all males, color blind. No, because some daughters are color blind, and some sons are normal.

Option H: (1/2) female normal, (1/2) color blind; same for males. So 50% of each sex. That matches our Punnett square.

Wait, but according to the Punnett square, each child has a 25% chance of each of the four possibilities. So in terms of sex:

Daughters (XX) are from the father's Xb and the mother's XB or Xb.

Sons (XY) get Y from father and X from mother.

So in the Punnett square, the daughters are:

- XBXb (normal) and XbXb (color blind), each 25% (so 50% each overall for daughters).

The sons are XBY (normal) and XbY (color blind), each 25% (so 50% each for sons).

So overall, 50% of the daughters have normal vision, 50% color blind.

50% of the sons have normal vision, 50% color blind.

So the phenotypic ratio is equal among males and females. So looking at the options, which one matches this?

Option H says: (1/2) female normal, (1/2) color blind; same for males. So 50% each.

But wait, option H says it's (1/2) for each, but each child is either a daughter or a son. So the overall distribution would be 25% normal daughter, 25% color blind daughter, 25% normal son, 25% color blind son. So yes, 50% of females (half) are normal, half are color blind; same for males.

Looking at the options:

Option H: (1/2) female normal; (1/2) female color; (1/2) male normal; (1/2) male color.

Wait, that can't be right because each child is either a daughter or a son. So the actual distribution is 25% each for the four possibilities.

So the correct option would be H, but wait, let me check the options again.

Option H says: ½ female normal, ½ female color; same for males.

But that's not the case, because each child is either a girl or a boy. So the overall breakdown is:

Daughters: 50% normal (XBXb), 50% color (XbXb).

Sons: 50% normal (XBY), 50% color (XbY).

So for each sex, half are normal, half are color. So the correct option is H.

Wait, but looking at the options again, let me make sure.

Option H: (1/2) female, normal; (1/2) female, color; same for males.

But the way the options are phrased, I think H is correct because each sex has 50% normal and 50% color.

Wait, but another way: the possible outcomes are 25% normal daughter, 25% color daughter, 25% normal son, 25% color son.

So overall, 50% of the children are daughters, half of them normal, half color. And 50% sons, half normal, half color.

So the correct answer would be H.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option C says all males are normal. That's not correct because 50% of sons are color blind.

Option H seems correct.

Wait, but looking at the options again: the options are structured as fractions for each possible outcome.

Wait, the options are:

H: (1/2) female, normal; (1/2) female, color; (1/2) male, normal; (1/2) male, color.

But that would imply that each group is 50% of all children. But actually, each child can't be both a daughter and a son, so the correct way is that among the daughters, 50% are normal, and among the sons, 50% are normal.

So the overall ratio is 50% daughters (each with 50% normal, 50% color) and 50% sons (each with 50% normal, 50% color).

So the correct answer is H.

Wait, but let me make sure. Another way to think: the woman is XBXb, so she can pass on XB or Xb. The man is XbY, so he can pass Xb or Y.

Daughters get X from father and X from mother. So:

- If mother gives XB and father gives Xb: XBXb (normal)
- If mother gives Xb and father gives Xb: XbXb (color blind)

So daughters have a 50% chance of each.

Sons get X from mother and Y from father.

- Mother gives XB: XBY (normal)
- Mother gives Xb: XbY (color blind)

So sons have 50% chance each.

So yes, H is correct.

The problem involves determining the phenotypic outcomes for the children of a red-green color-blind man (XbY) and a woman with normal vision (XBXb), whose father was color blind. Since red-green color blindness is a recessive, sex-linked trait, the analysis focuses on the possible genotypes and phenotypes of their offspring.

### Parental Genotypes:
- **Man (color blind):** XbY
- **Woman (normal vision, carrier):** XBXb (since her father was XbY and her mother provided XB)

### Gametes:
- **Man:** Xb (50%) or Y (50%)
- **Woman:** XB (50%) or Xb (50%)

### Punnett Square:
|       | Xb (Man) | Y (Man) |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **XB**| XBXb     | XBY     |
| **Xb**| XbXb     | XbY     |

### Possible Offspring:
1. **Daughters (XX):**
   - **XBXb:** 50% chance of normal vision (carrier).
   - **XbXb:** 50% chance of color blind.
2. **Sons (XY):**
   - **XBY:** 50% chance of normal vision.
   - **XbY:** 50% chance of color blind.

### Phenotypic Ratios:
- **Daughters:** 50% normal, 50% color blind.
- **Sons:** 50% normal, 50% color blind.

### Correct Option:
The option that matches these results is **H**, which states that half of the females are normal, half are color blind, and the same applies to the males.

**Answer: H**
