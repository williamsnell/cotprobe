Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about qualitative research, specifically focusing on case studies. The question is asking which statement about case studies cannot be correct. Let me try to work through this step by step.

First, I remember that case studies are a qualitative research method where an in-depth examination of a single case is conducted. They're often used to explore complex phenomena and provide detailed insights. But I need to think about each option to see which one is incorrect.

Option A: "Case studies are based on the assumption that the case can be generalized." Wait, isn't that the opposite of what case studies usually do? I think case studies are more about understanding a specific instance deeply rather than generalizing to a larger population. So if they assume generalization, that might not be correct. But I'm not entirely sure. I'll keep this in mind.

Option B: "Case studies do not rely on multiple sources of information." No, I remember that case studies often use triangulation, which means using multiple sources and methods to gather data. So if this option says they don't rely on multiple sources, that's probably incorrect. So B might be the wrong statement.

Option C: "Case studies are always conducted over a short period of time." I think case studies can vary in duration. Some might be done quickly, especially if the researcher is already familiar with the case, but others can take a long time. So saying "always" is a strong word here. Maybe C is incorrect, but I'm not certain yet.

Option D: "Case studies always require a large sample size for accurate results." Wait, case studies typically focus on a single case or a small number of cases. A large sample size isn't necessary because the goal is depth, not breadth. So D is definitely incorrect because they don't need a large sample. But the question is about which statement cannot be correct, so D is a contender.

Option E: "Case studies can only be used in the field of psychology." No, case studies are used in various fields like sociology, education, business, etc. So E is incorrect because they're not limited to psychology.

Option F: "Case studies are a detailed examination of a single case." Yes, that's the definition. So F is correct, not the answer.

Option G: "Case studies are used for attitude measurement, preferences, & satisfaction." I'm not sure. I think they can be used for understanding people's attitudes in depth, but I'm not certain if this is a common use. Maybe, but not sure if it's incorrect.

Option H: "Case studies are most useful as a pilot study to identify variables that can be studied in other ways." That sounds plausible. Case studies can help identify variables for larger studies, so H is likely correct.

Option I: "Case studies do not provide in-depth understanding of a particular instance." No, this is wrong because case studies are all about in-depth understanding. So I is incorrect.

Now, looking back, the question asks which statement cannot be correct. So I need to find the incorrect one.

From the options, A says case studies assume generalization. But I think case studies don't generalize; they focus on specifics. So A is incorrect.

Similarly, B says they don't rely on multiple sources, which is wrong because they do rely on multiple sources. So B is incorrect.

C says always short-term, which is not necessarily true. So C could be incorrect.

D says always require large samples, which is incorrect because they usually use small samples.

E says only psychology, which is incorrect.

I says they don't provide in-depth, which is wrong.

So the options that are incorrect statements about case studies are A, B, C, D, E, I.

Wait, but the question is which one cannot be correct. So I need to pick the one that's definitely wrong.

The options that are definitely wrong are A, B, D, E, I.

Looking back at the options, the question is about when qualitative research is done, theory is developed from the data, helping refine hypotheses. So it's about the nature of qualitative research, which case studies are part of.

So, the incorrect statements would be those that go against what case studies are known for.

Option B says they don't rely on multiple sources. That's wrong because case studies do rely on multiple sources. So B is incorrect.

Option D says they always require a large sample. That's incorrect because case studies are usually small.

Option E says only psychology. Also incorrect.

Option I says they don't provide in-depth, which is wrong.

But the question is which one cannot be correct. So which of these is an incorrect statement about case studies.

Wait, the options are A to I, and the answer is one of them.

Let me think again.

Option A: Case studies assume generalization. No, they don't. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Do not rely on multiple sources. No, they do. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Always short-term. Not necessarily. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Always large sample. No, so D is incorrect.

Option E: Only psychology. No, so E is incorrect.

Option I: Do not provide in-depth. No, so I is incorrect.

Wait, but the question is which statement cannot be correct. So all these options (A, B, C, D, E, I) are incorrect, but the question is asking for the one that cannot be correct. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Let me think of each option:

A: If case studies assume generalization, that's not correct. They are about specific instances, not generalizing.

B: Do not rely on multiple sources? No, they do rely on multiple sources. So B is wrong.

C: Always short-term. No, they can be long-term.

D: Always large sample. No, small sample.

E: Only psychology. No.

F: Correct.

G: Used for attitude, etc. I'm not sure, but possible.

H: As pilot studies. Correct.

I: Do not provide in-depth. Wrong.

So the incorrect statements are A, B, C, D, E, I.

But the question is which one is not correct. So the options given are A to I, and the answer must be one of them.

Looking back, the question is about when qualitative research is done, theory is developed from the data, which is inductive. So case studies are part of qualitative research.

Now, looking at the options, the one that cannot be correct is likely option D: Case studies always require a large sample size for accurate results. Because case studies are about depth, not breadth, so they don't need a large sample.

Alternatively, option A is incorrect because case studies don't assume generalization.

But the question is which statement cannot be correct. So perhaps the answer is D, because case studies don't require a large sample. Or maybe A.

Wait, the question is which statement cannot be correct. So the incorrect statements are those that are false.

Option A: Incorrect because case studies don't generalize.

Option B: Incorrect because they do rely on multiple sources.

Option C: Incorrect because they can be of varying durations.

Option D: Incorrect because they don't need a large sample.

Option E: Incorrect because they're used in many fields.

Option I: Incorrect because they do provide in-depth understanding.

So the possible incorrect options are A, B, C, D, E, I.

The question is asking which one cannot be correct. So the answer is one of these.

Looking back, the options are:

A: Based on generalization assumption.

B: Do not rely on multiple sources.

C: Always short.

D: Always large sample.

E: Only psychology.

F: Detailed single case.

G: Used for attitude, etc.

H: Pilot study.

I: Do not provide in-depth.

The correct statements are F, H, G, etc.

Now, which of the options is definitely incorrect.

Option E: Can only be used in psychology. Definitely incorrect.

Option D: Always large sample. Incorrect.

Option I: Do not provide in-depth. Incorrect.

Option B: Do not rely on multiple sources. Incorrect.

Option A: Assume generalization. Incorrect.

So the answer must be one of these.

But the question is about which statement cannot be correct. So the one that is wrong.

Looking at the answer options, the user provided possible answers, and the correct answer is likely D or E.

Wait, the question is about which statement cannot be correct. So the incorrect statements are the ones that are false.

So the correct answer is the one that is incorrect.

The options are:

A: Incorrect (case studies don't generalize)

B: Incorrect (they do rely on multiple sources)

C: Incorrect (not always short)

D: Incorrect (no large sample needed)

E: Incorrect (used in many fields)

F: Correct

G: Maybe correct, but not sure

H: Correct

I: Incorrect (they do provide in-depth)

So among the options, the one that cannot be correct is E: Case studies can only be used in the field of psychology. That's definitely incorrect because they're used in various fields.

Alternatively, D: Always require large sample, which is also incorrect.

But the question is which one cannot be correct. So the options that are wrong are A, B, C, D, E, I.

But I need to pick the one that's incorrect.

Wait, the question is from the perspective of qualitative research where theory is developed from data, not before, and helps refine hypotheses.

In that context, case studies are a qualitative method.

Now, considering the options again:

Which one is not correct.

Option D: Always require a large sample. No, wrong.

Option E: Only psychology. Wrong.

Option I: Do not provide in-depth. Wrong.

So the answer could be any of these, but the question is which one cannot be correct.

Looking at the answer options, the user provided the options, and the correct answer is likely D or E.

Wait, but in qualitative research, case studies are typically small in sample size, so D is incorrect.

But the question is about which statement cannot be correct. So the answer is D.

Alternatively, E is also incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the answer depends on which statement is not correct.

Looking at the options, the one that cannot be correct is E: Case studies can only be used in the field of psychology. That's not true, so E is incorrect.

Similarly, D is incorrect.

But the question is asking which one cannot be correct, so perhaps the answer is D.

Wait, the question is about which statement cannot be correct, so it's the one that is false.

I think the correct answer is D: Case studies always require a large sample size for accurate results. Because case studies typically use small samples, focusing on depth rather than breadth.

Alternatively, E is also incorrect, but perhaps D is the more clearly incorrect statement.
</think>

When analyzing the statements about case studies, it's clear that case studies are qualitative research methods focused on in-depth examination of a single case or a small number of cases. They do not generalize to larger populations, rely on multiple sources of data, and are not limited to specific fields like psychology. Additionally, they do not require large sample sizes, as their goal is depth rather than breadth.

- **Option A**: Incorrect because case studies do not assume generalization.  
- **Option B**: Incorrect because case studies do rely on multiple sources of information.  
- **Option C**: Incorrect because case studies are not always conducted over a short period of time.  
- **Option D**: Incorrect because case studies do not require a large sample size.  
- **Option E**: Incorrect because case studies are used in various fields, not just psychology.  
- **Option F**: Correct, as case studies are a detailed examination of a single case.  
- **Option G**: Correct, as case studies can be used for attitude measurement, preferences, and satisfaction.  
- **Option H**: Correct, as case studies can serve as pilot studies.  
- **Option I**: Incorrect because case studies do provide in-depth understanding.  

Among these, **Option D** is particularly incorrect because case studies are not characterized by requiring a large sample size. Instead, they focus on depth and detail rather than breadth. 

Answer: D
