Okay, so I need to figure out which early battle led to the conversion of Mecca. Let me start by recalling what I know about early Islamic battles and their significance. Mecca was the birthplace of Islam and the location of the Kaaba, which was central to the religion. However, initially, Mecca was a place where the pagans were in control, and the early Muslims faced a lot of persecution. 

I remember that after the Hijra (migration) of Muhammad from Mecca to Medina, there were several battles between the Muslims and the Meccans. The key battles that stand out to me include the Battle of Badr, which was a significant early victory for the Muslims. Then there's the Battle of Uhud, which was a bit of a setback. There's also the Battle of the Trench, which was more of a defensive battle where the Muslims used trenches to protect themselves.

The question is about which battle led to Mecca's conversion. I think that after the Muslims gained strength and had some victories, they eventually took Mecca without much resistance. But which battle was the turning point? I'm pretty sure that the Battle of Hunayn was one of the later battles after the Conquest of Mecca. Wait, no, actually, I might be mixing things up.

Wait, the conversion of Mecca probably happened after the Muslims had established themselves in Medina and had defeated the Meccans in a major battle. The Battle of Badr was the first major battle where the Muslims won against the Meccans. But that was early on, and Mecca didn't convert right away. The Battle of Khaybar was another significant one, but I'm not sure if that's directly linked to Mecca's conversion.

I think the key battle that led to Mecca's peaceful surrender was the Battle of Hunayn. After that, the Muslims were able to take Mecca without a fight, leading to the conversion of the Meccans. Alternatively, some sources say that after the Battle of Badr, the Meccans were weakened, but it wasn't until later that Mecca fell.

Wait, another angle: the Conquest of Mecca happened in 630 CE, and it's often associated with the Battle of Hunayn, which was a battle that the Muslims won, leading to the Meccans surrendering and converting. So the Battle of Hunayn would be the one that led to Mecca's conversion.

Let me cross-check the options. The options are A through J, with C being the Battle of Hunayn. So the answer should be C.

The Battle of Hunayn was the key event that led to the conversion of Mecca, as it marked a significant victory for the Muslims, resulting in the peaceful surrender and conversion of the Meccans.

Answer: C
