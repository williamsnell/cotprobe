Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to electrostatics, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the charge of each ion when the electrostatic force between them is given. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem states: Two identical ions are separated by a distance of 5.0 × 10^-10 meters, and the magnitude of the electrostatic force between them is 3.7 × 10^-9 Newtons. I need to find the charge of each ion, and there are multiple-choice answers from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that Coulomb's Law is the key here. Coulomb's Law formula is F = k * |q1 * q2| / r². Since the ions are identical, both charges are the same, so q1 = q2 = q. Therefore, the formula simplifies to F = k * q² / r². I need to solve for q.

First, I should write down all the given values. The force F is 3.7 × 10^-9 N, the distance r is 5.0 × 10^-10 m. Oh, and Coulomb's constant k is approximately 8.988 × 10^9 N·m²/C². I can use that.

So rearranging the formula to solve for q, I get:

q² = (F * r²) / k

Then q would be the square root of that.

Let me plug in the numbers step by step.

First, calculate r squared. r is 5.0e-10 m, so r² is (5.0e-10)^2. Let's compute that: 5 squared is 25, and (10^-10)^2 is 10^-20. So r² = 25 × 10^-20 m², which is 2.5 × 10^-19 m². Wait, no, wait. 5^2 is 25, so 5e-10 squared is 25e-20, which is 2.5 × 10^-19 m²? Wait no, 25e-20 is 2.5e-19? Wait, 25e-20 is 25 × 10^-20, which is 2.5 × 10^-19. Yes, that's correct.

Next, multiply F by r²: F is 3.7e-9 N, so 3.7e-9 N * 2.5e-19 m² equals... Let me calculate that. Multiply 3.7 and 2.5 first. 3.7 * 2.5 is... 3 * 2.5 is 7.5, and 0.7 *2.5 is 1.75; so total is 9.25. Now, the exponents: 10^-9 * 10^-19 is 10^-28. So F*r² is 9.25e-28 N·m².

Now, divide that by k, which is 8.988e9 N·m²/C². So 9.25e-28 divided by 8.988e9. Let me compute that.

First, 9.25 / 8.988 is roughly about 1.03. Because 8.988 is almost 9, and 9.25 /9 is about 1.027. So approximately 1.03. Then the exponents: 10^-28 divided by 10^9 is 10^(-28-9)=10^-37. So q² ≈ 1.03e-37 C².

Now, take the square root of q² to find q. The square root of 1.03e-37 is sqrt(1.03) times 1e-18.5. Wait, because sqrt(1e-37) is 1e-18.5, which is the same as 1e-18 * 1e-0.5. 1e-0.5 is about 0.316. So sqrt(1e-37) is 3.16e-19 C. Because 1e-37 is (1e-18.5)^2.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(1.03e-37). So sqrt(1.03) is about 1.015, and sqrt(1e-37) is 1e-18.5, which is 3.16e-19. So 1.015 * 3.16e-19 is approximately 3.2e-19 C.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again because I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it more accurately.

Let me compute q² = (3.7e-9 * (5e-10)^2) / (8.988e9).

Wait, let's compute each part correctly.

First, (5e-10)^2 = 25e-20 = 2.5e-19 m².

Then F*r² = 3.7e-9 * 2.5e-19 = (3.7 * 2.5) * 1e-28 = 9.25e-28.

Now divide by k: 9.25e-28 / 8.988e9 = (9.25 /8.988) * 1e-28 / 1e9 = (≈1.03) * 1e-37.

So q² ≈ 1.03e-37, so q ≈ sqrt(1.03e-37) = sqrt(1.03) * sqrt(1e-37) = approximately 1.015 * 1e-18.5.

Wait, 1e-37 is (1e-18.5)^2, so sqrt(1e-37)=1e-18.5. 1e-18.5 is equal to 1e-18 * 1e-0.5. 1e-0.5 is about 0.316, so 0.316e-18, which is 3.16e-19 C.

So sqrt(1.03e-37) = sqrt(1.03) * 3.16e-19 ≈ 1.015 * 3.16e-19 ≈ 3.2e-19 C.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is 3.2 × 10^-19 C. But option F is written as "3.2 10^{-19} C", which I think is a typo; it's probably 3.2 × 10^-19.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculation because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me compute F*r² /k more accurately.

F = 3.7e-9 N
r = 5e-10 m
k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C²

So F*r² = 3.7e-9 * (5e-10)^2 = 3.7e-9 * 25e-20 = 3.7 *25 *1e-29 = 92.5e-29 = 9.25e-28.

Then q² = (9.25e-28) / (8.988e9) = (9.25 /8.988) * 1e-37.

9.25 /8.988 = approximately 1.03.

So q² ≈ 1.03e-37 → q ≈ sqrt(1.03e-37) = sqrt(1.03) * sqrt(1e-37) ≈ 1.0148 * 3.1623e-19.

Let me compute that:

1.0148 * 3.1623 = approximately 3.202e-19 C.

So about 3.2e-19 C. Looking at the options, option F is 3.2 × 10^-19 C. But wait, checking the options again, option F is written as "3.2 10^{-19} C", which I think is a formatting error and should be 3.2 × 10^-19 C. So that would match.

Wait, but let me check my calculation again because maybe I messed up a step. Let me compute 3.7e-9 * (5e-10)^2.

(5e-10)^2 = 25e-20 = 2.5e-19 m².

3.7e-9 * 2.5e-19 = (3.7 * 2.5) × 1e-28 = 9.25e-28.

Then divide by 8.988e9: 9.25e-28 / 8.988e9 = (9.25 /8.988) × 1e-37 ≈ 1.03 × 1e-37 = 1.03e-37.

Taking square root, sqrt(1.03e-37) = sqrt(1.03) × sqrt(1e-37) ≈ 1.0148 × 3.1623e-19 ≈ 3.202e-19 C.

So the charge is approximately 3.2 × 10^-19 C, which is option F.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option F is written as "3.2 10^{-19} C", which I think is a typo. So I assume it's 3.2 × 10^-19 C.

But wait, let me check the options again. Oh, looking at the options:

A: 1.0e-19 C
B: 4.2e-19
C: 2.0e-18
D:3.6e-19
E:1.6e-19
F:3.2 10^{-19} C
G:4.8e-19
H:2.8e-19
I:6.4e-19
J:5.0e-19

Wait, option F seems to be written as "3.2 10^{-19} C", which is confusing. Maybe it's a typo, and the intended value is 3.2 ×10^-19 C. So I think option F is the correct one.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute q² again.

q² = (F * r²) /k = (3.7e-9 N) * (5e-10 m)^2 / (8.988e9 N·m²/C²)

Compute (5e-10)^2 = 25e-20 = 2.5e-19 m².

Multiply by F: 3.7e-9 * 2.5e-19 = (3.7 * 2.5) = 9.25, and exponents: 10^-9 *10^-19=10^-28. So 9.25e-28.

Divide by 8.988e9: 9.25e-28 /8.988e9 = (9.25/8.988) * 1e-37 ≈1.03 *1e-37 =1.03e-37.

So q = sqrt(1.03e-37) = sqrt(1.03) * sqrt(1e-37) ≈1.0148 * 3.1623e-19 ≈3.202e-19 C.

Yes, so 3.2e-19 C, which is option F.

Wait, but in the options, option J is 5.0e-19, which is higher. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the exponents again.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents in the calculation. Let me go through it once more.

Compute F*r²:

F =3.7e-9 N
r =5e-10 m → r²= (5e-10)^2 =25e-20 =2.5e-19 m².

F*r²=3.7e-9 * 2.5e-19 = (3.7 *2.5) *1e-28.

3.7 * 2.5 = 9.25, so 9.25e-28.

Divide by k=8.988e9:

9.25e-28 /8.988e9 = (9.25 /8.988) *1e-37 ≈1.03 *1e-37 =1.03e-37.

So q²=1.03e-37 → q≈sqrt(1.03e-37)=sqrt(1.03) * sqrt(1e-37)=1.0148 * 3.1623e-19 ≈3.202e-19 C.

So yes, 3.2e-19 C is correct.

Looking back, option F is "3.2 10^{-19} C", which I think is supposed to be 3.2 ×10^-19 C. So the correct answer should be F.

Wait a minute, but wait another thought: The charges are ions, so they must be integer multiples of the elementary charge, which is about 1.6e-19 C. But 3.2e-19 is exactly 2 times the elementary charge. So perhaps each ion has a charge of 2e, which is possible if they are doubly charged ions, like Mg²+ or something.

But the options don't have 3.2e-19 as an option. Wait, looking again, option F is 3.2 ×10^-19 C. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but in my calculation, I got approximately 3.2e-19 C, so the correct option is F.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see option F is written as "3.2 10^{-19} C", which might be a typo and should be 3.2 ×10^-19 C. So I think that's the answer.

To determine the charge of each ion, we use Coulomb's Law:

\[
F = k \cdot \frac{q^2}{r^2}
\]

Given:
- \( F = 3.7 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{N} \)
- \( r = 5.0 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
- \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \)

Rearranging for \( q^2 \):

\[
q^2 = \frac{F \cdot r^2}{k}
\]

First, calculate \( r^2 \):
\[
r^2 = (5.0 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 25 \times 10^{-20} = 2.5 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{m}^2
\]

Next, compute \( F \cdot r^2 \):
\[
F \cdot r^2 = (3.7 \times 10^{-9}) \cdot (2.5 \times 10^{-19}) = 9.25 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·m}^2
\]

Now, divide by \( k \):
\[
q^2 = \frac{9.25 \times 10^{-28}}{8.988 \times 10^9} = (9.25 / 8.988) \cdot 10^{-37} \approx 1.03 \times 10^{-37} \, \text{C}^2
\]

Taking the square root:
\[
q = \sqrt{1.03 \times 10^{-37}} \approx \sqrt{1.03} \cdot \sqrt{10^{-37}} \approx 1.015 \cdot 3.16 \times 10^{-19} \approx 3.2 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}
\]

Thus, the charge of each ion is approximately \( 3.2 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \), which corresponds to option F.

Answer: F
