Question:

A radioactive isotope, which is used in diagnostic imaging, has a half-life of 6.0 hours. If a quantity of this isotope has an activity of 150 mCi when it is delivered to a hospital, how much activity will remain 24 hours after delivery? (mCi = microcuries)

Options:

A: 150 mCi
B: 9.4 mCi
C: 4.7 mCi
D: 12.5 mCi
E: 25 mCi
F: 50 mCi
G: 19 mCi
H: 75 mCi
I: 38 mCi
J: 2.3 mCi

Okay, so I've got this problem here about radioactive isotopes and their half-lives. Hmm, I remember that the half-life is the time it takes for half of the substance to decay. The question is asking about the activity remaining after 24 hours. Let's see.

The isotope has a half-life of 6 hours. Activity is about how much the isotope is decaying per unit time, right? So if the initial activity is 150 mCi, I need to find out how much is left after 24 hours.

First, I should calculate how many half-lives have passed in 24 hours. Since each half-life is 6 hours, I divide 24 by 6. That's 24 ÷ 6 = 4. So four half-lives have passed.

Now, each half-life reduces the activity by half. So after one half-life, it's 150 / 2 = 75 mCi. After two, 75 / 2 = 37.5 mCi. Three would be 18.75 mCi, and four would be 9.375 mCi. Wait, let me check that again.

Alternatively, I remember the formula for activity after time t is A = A0 * (1/2)^(t / T), where T is the half-life. So plugging in the numbers: A = 150 * (1/2)^(24/6) = 150 * (1/2)^4.

Calculating that, (1/2)^4 is 1/16, which is 0.0625. Then 150 * 0.0625 equals... let's see, 150 divided by 16 is 9.375 mCi. Hmm, looking at the options, option B is 9.4 mCi, which must be the closest. So the answer should be B.

The isotope has a half-life of 6 hours. After 24 hours, four half-lives have passed. Using the formula A = A₀ * (1/2)^(t/T), where A₀ is the initial activity (150 mCi), t is 24 hours, and T is 6 hours, we calculate A = 150 * (1/2)^4 = 150 * 1/16 = 9.375 mCi. The closest option is B.

Answer: B
