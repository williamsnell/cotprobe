Question:

A state has a statute prohibiting the sale of guns and ammunition to any person under the age of 17. Violation of the statute is a felony punishable by a fine of $5,000 and imprisonment for up to two years. The state courts have interpreted this statute as a public welfare offense requiring no particular mental state for its violation. As such, this is a strict liability crime whereby culpability is imposed on a defendant for doing the proscribed act. A defendant, a 15-year-old, entered the store to purchase a shotgun as a present for her father. She took a shotgun off the shelf and went to the cashier's counter to pay for it. Not seeing the cashier anywhere, the defendant left the exact price for the shotgun on the countertop and left the store. If the defendant is prosecuted for violating the state statute, she should be found

Options:

A: not guilty, provided that the legislative intent was not to make the purchase of shotguns a criminal offense.
B: not guilty, if she believed the gun was a toy and not a real weapon.
C: not guilty, because she did not have any criminal intent when purchasing the shotgun.
D: guilty, because she did not wait for the cashier to handle the transaction properly.
E: not guilty, provided that she returns the shotgun immediately upon learning of the statute.
F: not guilty, provided she was unaware that the statute prohibited the sale of weapons to a person in her age group.
G: guilty, because she purchased the shotgun while under the statutory age.
H: guilty, because she left the money for the shotgun and took the gun without any supervision.
I: guilty, because her age alone qualifies her for the strict liability of the statute.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this law question. Let's break it down step by step. 

The question is about a state statute that prohibits selling guns or ammo to anyone under 17. The punishment is a fine and up to two years in jail. The courts have said this is a public welfare offense, which means it's strict liability. So, strict liability crimes don't require any specific intent or mental state. That means even if you didn't know it was illegal, you can still be guilty if you did the act.

The defendant is a 15-year-old who went into a store to buy a shotgun for her father. She took the gun off the shelf and went to the cashier. But she didn't see the cashier, so she left the money on the counter and left the store with the gun.

The issue is whether she's guilty under this statute. The options are A through I, and I need to pick the right one.

First, since it's a strict liability crime, her state of mind doesn't matter. So if she didn't know it was illegal or thought it was a toy, that shouldn't matter. Let's look at the options.

Option A says she's not guilty if the legislative intent wasn't to make buying a gun a crime. But the statute says it's a sale prohibition. So she's buying, not selling. Wait, the statute prohibits selling to under 17, not buying. So maybe the store is selling to her. Or is she buying from the store? So she's trying to purchase, which would be the store selling to her. So the statute applies because the seller (store) can't sell to her. But she's the buyer. Wait, no, the statute is about the seller; it's the seller who can't sell to someone under 17. So if the store violates the statute by selling to her, then the store is guilty. But the question is about the defendant, the 15-year-old, being prosecuted. So maybe she's not the seller but the buyer. Wait, can the buyer be prosecuted? The statute says it's a prohibition on selling to under 17. So it's the seller who's committing the crime by selling. So maybe the defendant isn't the one violating the statute because she's the buyer, not the seller. Hmm, that's a point.

Wait, the question says she took the shotgun and went to the cashier. Then she didn't see the cashier, left the money, and left with the gun. So she took the gun without paying? Or she left the money and took the gun? So maybe the cashier didn't handle the transaction, so she took the gun without the cashier's involvement. But the key is whether she's the one who committed the act of purchasing. But the statute prohibits the sale to her, not her purchasing. So the seller is the one who would be in violation, not the buyer. So if the store sold to her, the store is guilty, not her. So in that case, she might not be guilty because she's not the one who's violating the statute. But the question says she's the defendant being prosecuted, so maybe the state is charging her, which is confusing because the statute prohibits the seller, not the buyer.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the statute again: "prohibiting the sale of guns and ammunition to any person under the age of 17." So it's the seller who can't sell to her. So the defendant is the buyer, not the seller. So if she's the buyer, can she be prosecuted under this statute? Or is the statute only criminalizing the seller's action? That's important.

In that case, the defendant, as a buyer, might not be violating the statute. The statute is about the seller's action. So she can't be guilty because she's not the one selling; the store is. So the prosecution would be against the store, not her. But the question says she's being prosecuted. So maybe the statute is written differently, perhaps it's a strict liability offense for both parties? Or perhaps the statute makes it a crime for anyone under 17 to purchase, but that's not what the question says.

Wait, the question says the statute prohibits the sale to under 17. So the seller is the one committing the crime. So she's not the seller, so she's not guilty. But the options don't mention that. Let me look at the options again.

Option C says not guilty because she didn't have criminal intent. But since it's strict liability, intent doesn't matter. So C is wrong.

Option I says guilty because her age alone makes it strict liability. But if the statute only prohibits the seller from selling, then she's not the seller, so she can't be guilty. So I think the answer is that she's not guilty because the statute doesn't criminalize her action as the buyer.

Wait, but maybe the statute is written to make it a crime for a person under 17 to purchase. Let me check the question again. The question says the statute prohibits the sale to any person under 17. So the seller is the one prohibited, not the buyer. So the defendant, as the buyer, didn't commit the act that's prohibited by the statute. Therefore, she shouldn't be found guilty.

Looking at the options, which one aligns with this? Option A says not guilty if the legislative intent wasn't to make the purchase a crime. But the statute is about sale, not purchase. So if the legislative intent was only to prevent sellers from selling, then the buyer isn't guilty. So A could be a possibility.

But wait, the defendant's action is taking the gun and leaving money. If the cashier wasn't there, she took the gun. So she intended to buy it, but the cashier wasn't present. So she might have completed the purchase without the cashier, which would be the sale. But if the cashier didn't handle it, maybe the sale didn't occur. Or perhaps she effectively took the gun, which could be seen as a theft, but that's a different issue. But under the statute, it's about the sale.

Alternatively, maybe the statute is interpreted to criminalize the attempt to purchase. But I don't think so because the question says it's a public welfare offense, strict liability, but the act is the sale. So the defendant didn't commit the act of selling; she was trying to buy.

Therefore, she shouldn't be guilty because the statute doesn't criminalize her actions as the buyer. So looking at the options, the correct answer would be that she's not guilty because the statute doesn't apply to her as the buyer.

Option F says not guilty if she was unaware of the statute. But since it's strict liability, her awareness doesn't matter. So F is not correct.

Option I says guilty because of her age and strict liability. But if the statute only prohibits the seller from selling, then she's not the seller, so I is incorrect.

Option A says not guilty if the legislative intent wasn't to make the purchase a crime. That makes sense because the statute prohibits the sale, not the purchase. So unless the statute is interpreted to criminalize the buyer, she's not guilty.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because the defendant took the gun and left the money. So maybe the store didn't sell it to her because the cashier didn't handle it. So perhaps the sale didn't occur. Therefore, she didn't commit the act of purchasing because the cashier didn't process it. But she intended to buy it. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the act of taking the gun off the shelf and leaving the money constitutes an attempted purchase or theft. But the statute is about the sale. So unless the statute is interpreted to make it a crime for a minor to attempt to purchase, which it doesn't say.

So I think the correct answer is that she's not guilty because the statute doesn't criminalize her actions as a buyer. Therefore, option A or F. But F is about awareness, which doesn't matter in strict liability. So A is about legislative intent, which is more accurate.

Wait, but the statute prohibits the sale to her, so the seller is the one who would be guilty if they sold to her. But she's not the seller. So she's not the one committing the act. Therefore, she can't be guilty. So the answer should be not guilty because the statute doesn't apply to her as the buyer. Therefore, the correct option is A: not guilty, provided that the legislative intent was not to make the purchase of shotguns a criminal offense.

Wait, but the statute's wording is about the sale, not the purchase. So if the legislature only intended to punish sellers, not buyers, then she's not guilty. So option A is correct.

The statute prohibits the sale of guns to individuals under 17, making it a strict liability offense for the seller. The defendant, a 15-year-old, attempted to purchase a shotgun but did not complete the transaction as the cashier was unavailable. Since the statute only criminalizes the act of selling to a minor, the defendant, as the buyer, did not commit the prohibited act. Strict liability does not apply here because the statute does not criminalize the actions of the buyer. Therefore, the defendant should not be found guilty.

Answer: A
