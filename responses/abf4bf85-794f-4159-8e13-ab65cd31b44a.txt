Okay, so I need to figure out the escape velocity for a rocket to escape Earth's gravitational field. Hmm, I remember that escape velocity is the minimum speed needed for an object to break free from a planet's gravity without further propulsion. I think the formula for escape velocity is derived from gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy.

Wait, right, the formula is v = sqrt(2 * G * M / R), where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the Earth, and R is the radius of the Earth. I don't remember the exact values, but I think the escape velocity for Earth is something like 11,200 m/s. Let me double-check.

I recall that Earth's escape velocity is approximately 11.2 kilometers per second. Looking at the options, option A is 1.12 × 10^4 m/s, which is 11,200 m/s. That makes sense because 1.12e4 is 11,200. Option D is 8.48e3, which is around 8,480 m/s, that's lower than what I remember. Option E is 3.0e4, which is way too high, like 30,000 m/s, that's for other planets maybe. Option I is 2.24e4, which is even higher, so no. Option B is 9.81e3, about 9,810 m/s, which is close to Earth's surface gravity, but not escape velocity. Oh wait, 9.81 m/s² is the acceleration due to gravity, but that's not the velocity.

Wait, another thought: sometimes people confuse orbital velocity with escape velocity. The orbital velocity for a low Earth orbit is about 7.8 km/s, which is close to option J (7.0e3) but a bit lower. So that's not the escape velocity. The escape velocity is higher than the orbital velocity because you need more speed to break free than to just orbit.

Looking back, the options: A is 1.12e4, which is 11,200 m/s, that's correct. So the answer should be A.

The escape velocity for Earth is approximately 11.2 kilometers per second, which corresponds to option A (1.12 × 10^4 m/s).
