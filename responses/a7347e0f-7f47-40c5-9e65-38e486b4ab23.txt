Question:

What is the relationship between Westphalian sovereignty and humanitarian intervention?

Options:

A: Theories of Westphalian sovereignty argue that humanitarian intervention is an essential tool for maintaining global security, and hence should be supported by all states.
B: State sovereignty and principles of non-interference that underpin the Westphalian approach can be disregarded, provided that there is a consensus amongst international actors that human life within the state is at risk, and where that risk is from the actions of the state itself.
C: The Westphalian model of sovereignty promotes the idea of shared responsibility, arguing that states have a duty to intervene in a humanitarian crisis, regardless of the sovereignty of the affected state.
D: In its advocacy of global political institutions, the Treaty of Westphalia defined state sovereignty as being subjective to the behaviour of the political or ruling elite in that state, prioritizing human welfare over arbitrary values of sovereignty and thus legitimising humanitarian intervention where necessary.
E: Theories of Westphalian sovereignty decree that principles of non-intervention are paramount to achieving security; this has been extended into the contemporary global security environment in which international bodies such as the UN condemn humanitarian intervention, regarding it as detrimental to state-centric security.
F: Westphalian sovereignty supports the idea of humanitarian intervention only when it is requested by the state in question.
G: The Westphalian concept of sovereignty emphasizes the importance of international cooperation and hence supports the idea of humanitarian intervention under the supervision of international bodies.
H: The international society is governed by norms of Westphalian sovereignty that advocate non-intervention and the respect of state sovereignty as a means of achieving security. These norms are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, which bans the use of force between states except in self-defence or when authorized by the UN.
I: Westphalian sovereignty and humanitarian intervention are not related, as the former is a political concept and the latter is a social one.

Okay, so I've got this question about Westphalian sovereignty and humanitarian intervention, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about these terms.

Westphalian sovereignty is based on the Treaty of Westphalia from 1648, which ended the Thirty Years' War. The key ideas are state sovereignty, territorial integrity, and non-interference. So, each state is considered sovereign, meaning it has full control over its territory and isn't subject to external intervention. This is a foundational principle in international law and relations.

Humanitarian intervention, on the other hand, refers to the use of military force by one state or an international body to prevent human rights violations in another country. This is often controversial because it goes against the principle of non-interference that Westphalian sovereignty upholds.

The question is asking about the relationship between these two concepts. Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A says that theories of Westphalian sovereignty argue that humanitarian intervention is essential for global security and should be supported by all states. That doesn't sound right because Westphalian sovereignty is about non-interference, which would oppose humanitarian intervention unless it's a consensus. But I don't think the theory itself says it's essential; rather, it's more about state sovereignty.

Option B suggests that state sovereignty and non-interference can be disregarded if there's a consensus that human life is at risk and the state itself is the cause. Hmm, this touches on the idea that sometimes, even with Westphalian principles, intervention is allowed if there's a strong agreement. But I'm not sure if it's about the state's actions being the cause.

Option C claims that the Westphalian model promotes shared responsibility and states have a duty to intervene. That seems off because the Westphalian model is more about state sovereignty and non-interference, not about a duty to intervene. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D states that the Treaty of Westphalia defined sovereignty as subject to the behavior of the political elite and prioritizes human welfare, thus legitimizing humanitarian intervention. I don't think the original treaty was about that. It was more about recognizing state sovereignty without external interference. So D might not be right.

Option E says that Westphalian theories prioritize non-intervention for security, and the UN condemns humanitarian intervention. Wait, the UN actually allows for humanitarian intervention under certain conditions, like through Chapter VII of the UN Charter. So E seems incorrect because it's not that the UN condemns it, but that it's a tricky area.

Option F suggests that intervention is only supported if requested by the state. That makes sense because under Westphalian sovereignty, a state can invite intervention, like in some peacekeeping missions. But does this theory support it only in that case? I'm not sure if that's the whole picture.

Option G says that Westphalian sovereignty emphasizes international cooperation and supports humanitarian intervention under international supervision. That seems a bit contradictory because Westphalian sovereignty is about state sovereignty, not necessarily international cooperation. But some scholars might argue that modern interpretations allow for cooperation, so maybe G is partially correct.

Option H describes that international society under Westphalian norms advocates non-intervention and respect for sovereignty, which are in the UN Charter. This sounds more accurate. The UN Charter does have the non-use of force except in self-defense or with Security Council authorization. So H seems correct.

Option I claims they're unrelated because one is political and the other social. That doesn't make sense since both are political concepts, especially in international relations.

So going back, the main point is that Westphalian sovereignty is about state sovereignty and non-interference. The UN Charter reflects this with its ban on the use of force, which is about non-intervention. Option H aligns with that.

Wait, but what about the other options? Option B talks about disregarding sovereignty when there's a consensus. That's more about the responsibility to protect (R2P) doctrine, which is a modern concept that allows intervention under certain circumstances. But the question is about Westphalian sovereignty, which traditionally doesn't support this. So Option H is more about the established norms without the newer R2P ideas.

Therefore, the correct answer is H because it accurately describes the norms of non-intervention and respect for sovereignty as per the UN Charter, which is rooted in Westphalian principles.
