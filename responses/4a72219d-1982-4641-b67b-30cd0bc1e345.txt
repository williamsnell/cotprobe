Question:

A group of scientists wanted to estimate the proportion of geese returning to the same site for the next breeding season. Suppose they decided to increase the sample size from 200 to 2,000. How will this affect the distribution of the sample proportion?

Options:

A: The shape of the distribution of the sample proportion will change significantly.
B: There will be no noticeable change in the distribution of the sample proportion.
C: The distribution of the sample proportion will become more uniform.
D: The distribution of the sample proportion will become skewed.
E: The distribution of the sample proportion will be more spread out.
F: The distribution of the sample proportion will more closely resemble the binomial distribution.
G: The distribution of the sample proportion will be less spread out.
H: The spread of the distribution of the sample proportion will remain unaffected.

Okay, so I have this question about statistics, specifically dealing with sample proportions and how changing the sample size affects the distribution. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question says that scientists are estimating the proportion of geese returning to the same site for the next breeding season. They increased their sample size from 200 to 2,000. I need to figure out how this change will impact the distribution of the sample proportion.

First, I remember that when dealing with sample proportions, the distribution can be approximated using the normal distribution under certain conditions. This is related to the Central Limit Theorem for proportions. The key points here are the sample size and the values of success and failure.

The formula for the standard error (SE) of the sample proportion is sqrt[(p*(1-p))/n], where p is the true proportion and n is the sample size. As the sample size n increases, the standard error decreases because the denominator gets larger. A smaller SE means that the distribution of the sample proportion will be less spread out. So the samples will cluster more closely around the true proportion p.

In the original sample, n was 200, and now it's increased to 2000. Let's think about how this affects SE. The SE is inversely proportional to the square root of n. So increasing n by a factor of 10 (from 200 to 2000) would decrease the SE by a factor of sqrt(10), which is about 3.16. That means the spread of the distribution (the standard deviation) becomes smaller.

Looking at the options, option G says the distribution becomes less spread out. That aligns with what I just thought because a larger sample size reduces the standard error, making the distribution tighter around the true proportion.

Option E says the distribution becomes more spread out, which would be the opposite effect. So that's not correct. Option H says the spread remains unaffected, which isn't true because n does affect SE.

Other options: A says the shape changes significantly. Well, if the sample size is large enough, the distribution should already be approximately normal, so increasing n might make it even more normal, but the shape (like normality) wouldn't change drastically. So maybe A isn't the best choice.

Option C suggests it becomes more uniform, which doesn't make sense because the sample proportion distribution is approximated by a normal distribution, not uniform.

Option D says it becomes skewed. If the sample size is large, the distribution should be approximately normal, so unless there's a reason for skewness, which isn't mentioned here, this might not be right.

Option F talks about resembling the binomial distribution. Wait, the binomial is for individual trials, but the sampling distribution of the sample proportion tends towards normal as n increases, especially with large n. So F might not be correct because the sample proportion distribution becomes more normal, not binomial.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be G: The distribution of the sample proportion will be less spread out.

When the sample size increases, the standard error decreases, making the distribution of the sample proportion less spread out.

Answer: G
