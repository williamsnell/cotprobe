Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find out how many ways a set of 6 distinct letters can be partitioned into two non-empty groups, with each group having at least 2 letters. The options are from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with partitions of a set into groups, the key is to consider the different ways to divide the elements. Since the set has 6 letters, and each group must have at least 2 letters, the possible sizes for the groups are limited. The possible splits would be:

- One group with 2 letters and the other with 4 letters.
- One group with 3 letters and the other with 3 letters.

I don't think splits like 1 and 5 are allowed because each group must have at least 2 letters. So, the only valid splits are 2-4 and 3-3.

Now, let's calculate each case separately.

Starting with the 2-4 split. How many ways can I choose 2 letters out of 6? That's a combination problem. The number of ways to choose 2 letters from 6 is C(6,2), which is 15. But wait, since the groups are two non-empty sets, each split into 2 and 4 is unique, but I have to consider whether the order matters here. Wait, the problem says "partitioned into two groups," and since the groups are not labeled (like Group A and Group B), each split is counted once. So, choosing 2 letters and the remaining 4 automatically form the other group. So, the number of ways for the 2-4 split is 15.

Next, the 3-3 split. Here, how many ways can I choose 3 letters from 6? That's C(6,3), which is 20. But wait, this is tricky because choosing group A as the first 3 and group B as the remaining 3 is the same as choosing group B first and then group A. So, if I just calculate C(6,3), I would be counting each partition twice. So to get the correct number, I should divide by 2. So, 20 divided by 2 is 10. Therefore, the number of ways for the 3-3 split is 10.

Now, adding both cases together: 15 (for 2-4) + 10 (for 3-3) equals 25. Hmm, but wait, the options don't have 25 as the only answer. Let me check the options again. Option D is 25, but I also need to make sure I haven't missed any other possible splits.

Wait a second, the problem says "partitioned into two non-empty groups." So, each group must have at least 2 letters. So, the only possible splits are indeed 2-4 and 3-3. Are there any other possibilities? Let me think: 6 can be split as 2+4 or 3+3. 1+5 is invalid because each group needs at least 2. So yes, those are the only two cases.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. Another approach is to consider all possible subsets and then adjust for overcounting. The total number of ways to partition into two non-empty subsets is 2^6 - 2 = 62. But that's without any restrictions on the size. But here, each group must have at least 2 letters, so I need to subtract the cases where one group has fewer than 2 letters.

Wait, maybe that's a more complicated way, but let's try it to cross-verify.

The total number of subsets of a 6-element set is 2^6 = 64. Each subset and its complement form a partition into two groups. So, the number of unordered partitions is (2^6 - 2)/2 = 31. But this includes all possible partitions where each group is non-empty, including those where one group has 1 or 5 elements, which we don't want.

So, from the 31 total partitions, we need to subtract those where one group has 1 element. How many such partitions are there? For each single element, the other group has 5 elements. So, for each of the 6 elements, there's exactly one such partition. So, there are 6 such cases. Each of these is counted once in the 31, so we subtract 6 from 31 to get 25. That matches my earlier calculation.

So, the answer should be 25, which is option D.

Wait, but another way to think: when I calculated 15 +10, I got 25. That seems correct. So, the answer is D:25.

The problem requires partitioning a set of 6 distinct letters into two non-empty groups, each with at least 2 letters. The valid splits are 2-4 and 3-3. For the 2-4 split, there are C(6,2) = 15 ways. For the 3-3 split, there are C(6,3)/2 = 10 ways (to account for double-counting). Adding these gives 15 + 10 = 25 ways. Thus, the correct answer is D.
