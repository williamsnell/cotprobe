Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says a lab technician made a calcium hydroxide solution by dissolving 1.48 grams of Ca(OH)₂ in water. Now, they want to know how many milliliters of 0.125 N HCl solution are needed to neutralize this calcium hydroxide solution. The options are given from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, okay, so first, I think this is a neutralization reaction between a strong acid and a strong base. Calcium hydroxide is a strong base, and HCl is a strong acid. So the reaction should produce water and calcium chloride. Let me write down the chemical equation to get started.

The reaction should be: Ca(OH)₂ + 2 HCl → CaCl₂ + 2 H₂O. Wait, yeah, because calcium has a +2 charge, so each OH⁻ needs an H+ to make water. So each Ca(OH)₂ has two OH⁻ ions, so it would need two HCl molecules to neutralize each OH⁻. So the ratio here is 1 mole of Ca(OH)₂ reacting with 2 moles of HCl. That's important because it tells me the mole ratio I'll need for the calculations.

Now, the next step is probably to find out how many moles of Ca(OH)₂ are in the solution. Since the technician used 1.48 grams, I'll need the molar mass of Ca(OH)₂ to find the moles.

Let me calculate the molar mass. Calcium (Ca) has a molar mass of about 40.08 g/mol. Oxygen (O) is 16.00 g/mol, and Hydrogen (H) is 1.008 g/mol. So Ca(OH)₂ has one Ca, two O, and two H in each formula unit. Wait no, wait: Ca(OH)₂ is actually calcium hydroxide, which is Ca(OH)₂. So each formula unit has one Ca, two O, and two H. Wait no, no: wait, each OH⁻ group has one O and one H. So Ca(OH)₂ has two OH groups, so two O and two H. So the molar mass is:

Ca: 40.08 g/mol
O: 16.00 per O atom, and there are two O atoms in the two OH groups, so 2 * 16.00 = 32.00 g/mol
H: Each OH has one H, two OH groups means two H atoms, so 2 * 1.008 = 2.016 g/mol
Adding them up: 40.08 + 32.00 + 2.016 = 74.096 g/mol. Let me double-check that. 40.08 + 32 is 72.08, plus 2.016 is 74.096. Yeah, that seems right.

So moles of Ca(OH)₂ = mass / molar mass = 1.48 g / 74.096 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 1.48 divided by 74.096... Let's see, 74.096 is approximately 74.1. So 1.48 / 74.1 ≈ 0.02 moles. Wait, let me do the exact division. 74.096 into 1.48.

Hmm, 74.096 * 0.02 is 1.48192, which is very close to 1.48, so yeah, the moles are approximately 0.02 mol. Wait, more accurately, 1.48 / 74.096 = 0.01997 moles, which rounds to about 0.0200 moles.

Now, the next step is to figure out the moles of HCl needed. From the balanced equation, 1 mole of Ca(OH)₂ reacts with 2 moles of HCl. So the moles of HCl needed would be 2 * moles of Ca(OH)₂. So that's 2 * 0.01997 ≈ 0.03994 moles, which is about 0.040 moles.

But wait, the HCl solution is given as 0.125 N. Normality (N) is equivalent to equivalents per liter. For HCl, since it's a monoprotic acid, each mole provides one equivalent. So the normality here is the same as molarity, because each mole gives one equivalent. So 0.125 N HCl is 0.125 M HCl.

Wait, but wait, in terms of equivalents, HCl is 1 equivalent per mole because it donates one H+. So, yes, N is same as M in this case for HCl.

But wait, wait: in the neutralization reaction, the equivalents of acid and base should be equal. Wait no, for neutralization, the equivalents of acid (HCl) and base (Ca(OH)₂) must balance.

Wait, let me think again. The reaction is Ca(OH)₂ + 2 HCl → CaCl₂ + 2 H₂O. So each mole of Ca(OH)₂ provides 2 equivalents of OH⁻. Each mole of HCl provides 1 equivalent of H⁺. So the neutralization is 2 equivalents of H+ reacting with 2 equivalents of OH- from Ca(OH)₂. So the equivalent ratio is 1:1. Wait, no, because the reaction is 1 Ca(OH)₂ to 2 HCl. So the equivalents of HCl would be 2 * 1 (because each HCl gives 1 equivalent), and Ca(OH)₂ gives 2 equivalents (since each OH⁻ is one equivalent). So 2 equivalents of HCl react with 2 equivalents of Ca(OH)₂. So the equivalents are equal.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think in terms of equivalents. For the base, Ca(OH)₂, each mole provides 2 moles of OH⁻, so each mole is 2 equivalents. For the acid, HCl, each mole provides 1 mole of H⁺, so each mole is 1 equivalent.

So the reaction is: 1 mole Ca(OH)₂ (2 equivalents) + 2 moles HCl (2 equivalents) → neutralization. So the equivalents of HCl needed are 2. So the ratio is equivalents of Ca(OH)₂ : equivalents of HCl = 2 : 2, which is 1:1. So the number of equivalents of acid needed equals the number of equivalents of base.

So, moles of Ca(OH)₂ is 0.01997, so equivalents of Ca(OH)₂ is 0.01997 * 2 = 0.03994 equivalents.

So, the HCl needed must also be 0.03994 equivalents.

Now, the HCl solution is 0.125 N, which is 0.125 equivalents per liter. So the volume needed (in liters) is equivalents / normality = 0.03994 / 0.125.

Let me compute that: 0.03994 ÷ 0.125. Hmm, 0.125 is 1/8, so dividing by 0.125 is the same as multiplying by 8. So 0.03994 * 8 = 0.31952 liters. To convert liters to milliliters, multiply by 1000, so 0.31952 L = 319.52 mL. Hmm, but looking at the options, the closest would be J:320 ml.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I make mistakes in the steps.

Wait, so moles of Ca(OH)₂ = 1.48 g / 74.096 g/mol = approximately 0.02 mol. Equivalents of Ca(OH)₂ = 0.02 mol * 2 = 0.04 equivalents. So HCl needed is also 0.04 equivalents. Then, volume of HCl = 0.04 equivalents / 0.125 eq/L = 0.32 L, which is 320 mL. So the answer should be J:320 ml.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Let me go through it again.

1. Calculate moles of Ca(OH)₂: 1.48 / 74.096 ≈ 0.01997 mol.
2. Equivalents of Ca(OH)₂ = moles * valence. Valence here is 2 because each Ca(OH)₂ gives two OH⁻ ions. So 0.01997 * 2 ≈ 0.03994 eq.
3. Since it's a neutralization reaction, the equivalents of HCl needed are equal to the equivalents of Ca(OH)₂. So HCl equivalents = 0.03994.
4. Normality of HCl = 0.125 eq/L. So volume needed = 0.03994 eq / 0.125 eq/L = 0.31952 L = 319.52 mL ≈ 320 mL.
So the correct answer is J:320 ml.

The problem involves determining the volume of 0.125 N HCl required to neutralize 1.48 g of Ca(OH)₂. Here's the solution:

1. **Calculate moles of Ca(OH)₂**:  
   Molar mass of Ca(OH)₂ = 74.096 g/mol.  
   Moles of Ca(OH)₂ = 1.48 g / 74.096 g/mol ≈ 0.01997 mol.

2. **Determine equivalents of Ca(OH)₂**:  
   Each mole of Ca(OH)₂ provides 2 equivalents (2 OH⁻ ions).  
   Equivalents = 0.01997 mol × 2 ≈ 0.03994 eq.

3. **Equivalents of HCl required**:  
   The reaction is 1:1 for equivalents (1 equivalent of OH⁻ reacts with 1 equivalent of H⁺).  
   Thus, HCl equivalents needed = 0.03994 eq.

4. **Calculate volume of HCl solution**:  
   Normality (N) = 0.125 eq/L.  
   Volume (L) = equivalents / normality = 0.03994 eq / 0.125 eq/L ≈ 0.31952 L.  
   Convert to mL: 0.31952 L × 1000 ≈ 319.52 mL ≈ 320 mL.
