Question:

How does the body control the amount of water excreted?

Options:

A: The body controls water excretion through sweat glands.
B: Water excretion is determined by the concentration of electrolytes in the body's cells.
C: The kidneys control water excretion by changing the size of the glomerulus.
D: Water excreted is controlled by the hormone insulin.
E: The body adjusts water excretion by altering the pH level of the blood.
F: Water excretion is regulated by the hormone glucagon.
G: The body controls the amount of water excreted by regulating the permeability of the walls of the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts to water, which is controlled by a hormone known as vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone (ADH).
H: Water excretion is solely controlled by the rate of respiration.
I: The body controls the amount of water excreted by regulating the heart rate.
J: The body modulates water excretion through the contraction and relaxation of skeletal muscles.

Okay, so I've got this question about how the body controls the amount of water it excretes. Hmm, I remember from biology class that water excretion is mainly through urine, right? But wait, there's also sweat and maybe even breath, but the question is about the main method.

The options are A to J. Let's go through them one by one. 

Option A says the body controls it through sweat glands. Well, sweat does release water, but that's not the primary way the body regulates water excretion. I think the main control is through the kidneys, so A might not be the best answer.

Option B says it's determined by electrolyte concentration. Electrolytes do play a role because when they're imbalanced, the body retains or excretes more water. But is that the control mechanism? I think it's more about hormones regulating how much water is reabsorbed by the kidneys.

Option C mentions the kidneys changing the size of the glomerulus. Wait, the glomerulus is part of the kidney's filtering units, but I don't recall them changing size. Instead, the permeability of the tubules is what's regulated. So C might not be correct.

Option D talks about insulin controlling water excretion. I know insulin is involved in sugar metabolism, not directly in water regulation, so D is probably wrong.

Option E says it's about adjusting pH levels. While the kidneys do help regulate pH, that's more about acid-base balance and not directly the control of water excretion amount. So E isn't the answer.

Option F mentions glucagon. Glucagon is for blood sugar levels, so it doesn't control water excretion. F is out.

Option G says the body controls water excretion by regulating the permeability of the walls of the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts, and it's controlled by vasopressin or ADH. That rings a bell. Vasopressin (also called ADH) is a hormone that increases water reabsorption in the kidneys, so when there's less ADH, more water is excreted. So G sounds correct.

Option H claims it's solely controlled by respiration. No, respiration does release some water vapor, but it's not the main way. So H is wrong.

Option I says heart rate regulates water excretion. That doesn't make sense. The heart rate is about circulation, not directly about water excretion. So I is incorrect.

Option J talks about skeletal muscles. No, muscles might release water through sweat, but that's not the primary regulatory mechanism. So J is not the right answer.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be G because it directly mentions the role of the kidneys, specifically the permeability of the tubules, and the hormone ADH. That's how the body controls water excretion by adjusting how much water is reabsorbed back into the bloodstream versus excreted as urine.

The body primarily controls water excretion through the kidneys by regulating the permeability of the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts, which is influenced by the hormone vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone, ADH). This hormone adjusts water reabsorption based on the body's hydration levels, ensuring proper water balance. 

Answer: G
