Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a proton falling towards Earth and converting its kinetic energy into a quantum of light. I need to find the frequency of that light. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the proton is at rest a long way away from Earth. So, when it starts moving towards Earth, it's because of gravitational attraction. As it falls, it gains kinetic energy. Since it's starting from rest, all its initial potential energy is converted into kinetic energy as it reaches Earth's surface.

Wait, but how do I calculate the potential energy here? Oh right, gravitational potential energy is given by the formula U = -GMm/r, where G is the gravitational constant, M is Earth's mass, m is the mass of the proton, and r is the distance from Earth's center. But since the proton is a long way away, I guess r is approximately the Earth's radius, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should just use the Earth's radius for r.

So when the proton is far away, its potential energy is almost zero. As it comes to Earth, the change in potential energy is from 0 to -GMm/R, where R is Earth's radius. But wait, no, actually, the change in potential energy would be the difference between the final and initial states. Since it's falling towards Earth, the potential energy becomes more negative. So the change in potential energy is ΔU = U_final - U_initial = (-GMm/R) - 0 = -GMm/R. Since energy is conserved, the kinetic energy at Earth's surface would be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, so KE = GMm/R.

Wait, but the problem says that all the kinetic energy is converted into the energy of a single quantum of light. So the KE equals the energy of the photon. The energy of a photon is E = hf, where h is Planck's constant and f is the frequency we're looking for.

So putting it all together: KE = GMm/R = hf → f = GMm/(hR).

Now I need to plug in the numbers. Let me list out the constants:

G = 6.674×10^-11 N·m²/kg²,
M = mass of Earth = 5.972×10^24 kg,
m = mass of proton = 1.673×10^-27 kg,
R = radius of Earth = 6.371×10^6 meters,
h = Planck's constant = 6.626×10^-34 J·s.

Wait, let me double-check those values. Yeah, I think those are correct.

So calculating GMm/(hR):

First, compute GM:
G*M = 6.674e-11 * 5.972e24 = let's compute that.

6.674e-11 * 5.972e24 = (6.674 * 5.972) * 10^( -11 +24 ) = approx 39.86e13 → 3.986e14 m³/s².

Now multiply by m, the proton mass: 3.986e14 * 1.673e-27 = let's compute that.

3.986e14 * 1.673e-27 = (3.986 * 1.673) * 10^(14-27) = approx 6.676e-13.

Wait, 3.986 * 1.673 is about 6.676? Let me compute 4 * 1.673 = 6.692, so 3.986 is a bit less, maybe around 6.67. So 6.67e-13 m²/s²·kg or whatever units.

Now divide by (hR):

h*R = 6.626e-34 J·s * 6.371e6 m = 6.626e-34 * 6.371e6 = let's compute that.

6.626 * 6.371 ≈ 42.28, so 42.28e-34+6 = 42.28e-28 = 4.228e-27 J·m.

So f = (6.67e-13) / (4.228e-27) = (6.67 / 4.228) * 10^( -13 +27 ) = approx 1.577 * 10^14 Hz.

Wait, 6.67 divided by 4.228 is roughly 1.577. So 1.577e14 Hz. Looking at the options, let's see which is closest.

The options given are:

A: 2.2 × 10^14
B: 0.8 × 10^14
C: 1.0 × 10^14
D: 1.2 × 1014 (probably 1.2e14)
E: 1.8 × 10^14
F: 2.0 ×1014 (2e14)
G:1.6 ×1014 (1.6e14)
H:1.9 ×1e14
I:2.5e14
J:1.4e14

Wait, my calculation gave about 1.577e14, which is approximately 1.6e14. So option G is 1.6 ×1014, which would match. But let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, when I calculated GM, I got 3.986e14, which is correct because that's Earth's standard gravitational parameter, GM, which is about 3.986e14 m³/s².

Then GMm = 3.986e14 * 1.673e-27 kg = 3.986e14 * 1.673e-27.

Wait, 3.986e14 * 1.673e-27 equals (3.986 * 1.673) * 10^(14-27) = approx 6.673e-13. So that part was correct.

Then hR is 6.626e-34 * 6.371e6 = let's compute that more accurately.

6.626e-34 *6.371e6 = 6.626 *6.371 = let me compute that:

6 *6=36, 6*0.371=2.226; 0.626*6=3.756; 0.626*0.371≈0.232. Adding all together: 36 +2.226 +3.756 +0.232 ≈ 42.214.

So 42.214e-34+6 → 42.214e-28 = 4.2214e-27 J·m.

So f = (6.673e-13) / (4.2214e-27) = (6.673 /4.2214) * 1e14.

6.673 ÷ 4.2214 ≈ let me compute that.

4.2214 * 1.5 = 6.3321. 6.673 -6.3321 = 0.3409. So 0.3409 /4.2214 ≈ 0.0808. So total is approx 1.5808, so 1.5808e14 Hz.

Which is approximately 1.58e14, so looking at the options, the closest is G: 1.6 ×1e14. So the answer should be G.

The problem involves a proton falling towards Earth, converting its gravitational potential energy into the energy of a single photon. Using the conservation of energy, the kinetic energy of the proton at Earth's surface equals the photon's energy. The frequency of the photon is calculated using the formula \( f = \frac{GMm}{hR} \), where \( G \), \( M \), \( m \), \( h \), and \( R \) are known constants. After performing the calculations, the frequency is found to be approximately \( 1.58 \times 10^{14} \, \text{Hz} \), which corresponds to option G.
