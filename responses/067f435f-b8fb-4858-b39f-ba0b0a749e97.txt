Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says: A sample of 4.50 g of methane occupies 12.7 dm³ at 310 K. We need to calculate the work done when the gas expands isothermally against a constant external pressure of 200 Torr until its volume increases by 3.3 dm³.

Hmm, right. So work done by the gas during expansion. Since it's an isothermal process, the temperature doesn't change, which might mean we can use the isothermal work formula.

Wait, I remember that for an isothermal process, the work done (w) is given by w = -P_ext * ΔV. But wait, is that the right formula? Or is it more involved?

Wait, actually, the formula I'm recalling is w = -nRT ln(V2/V1) when it's reversible, but this is against a constant external pressure, so maybe it's not reversible. Oh, right, when the expansion is against a constant external pressure, the work is w = -P_ext * (V2 - V1). Because it's a constant pressure, so the work is pressure times change in volume, but negative because the system is doing work on the surroundings.

But wait, let me make sure. For expansion, the work done by the system is negative from the system's perspective. So yes, the formula should be w = -P_ext * ΔV.

Wait, but the units here are in Torr. I think I need to convert that to Pascals because the standard unit for pressure in these calculations is Pascals.

Right, 1 Torr is 133.322 Pascals. So 200 Torr would be 200 * 133.322 Pa. Let me calculate that: 200 * 133.322 is 26,664.4 Pa.

Wait, but wait a second. The units for volume are in dm³. Since 1 dm³ is equal to 1 liter, which is 0.001 m³. So the change in volume, ΔV, is 3.3 dm³, which is 3.3 * 0.001 m³ = 0.0033 m³.

So putting it all together: w = -P_ext * ΔV.

So plugging in the numbers: w = -26,664.4 Pa * 0.0033 m³.

Let me compute that: 26,664.4 * 0.0033. Let's see:

0.0033 * 26,664.4 = let's compute 26,664.4 * 0.003 = 79.9932 and 26,664.4 * 0.0003=7.99932. Adding them together gives approximately 87.99252. So about 87.99 J.

But since work done by the system is negative, the work is -87.99 J, which rounds to -88 J. Looking at the options, option A is -88 J.

Wait, but wait another moment. I'm assuming that the external pressure is in the same units as the system. But wait, the problem states that the gas expands isothermally against a constant external pressure of 200 Torr. So I think my approach is correct.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the ideal gas law to find the number of moles and then compute the work via the isothermal formula, but since the pressure is constant external, perhaps the first method is sufficient.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I need to consider the initial pressure and whether the expansion is into a vacuum or against an external pressure. Since it's against a constant external pressure, the work should indeed be P_ext * ΔV, so the first method holds.

So the calculation gives me approximately -88 J, which is option A.
</think>

The work done during the isothermal expansion of the gas against a constant external pressure is calculated using the formula \( w = -P_{\text{ext}} \cdot \Delta V \). Converting the external pressure from Torr to Pascals and the volume change from dm³ to m³, the calculation yields \( w = -88 \mathrm{J} \).

Answer: A
