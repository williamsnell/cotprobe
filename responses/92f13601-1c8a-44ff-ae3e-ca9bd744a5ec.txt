Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to wrap my head around it. So, the question is about a photon striking an electron at rest, creating an electron-positron pair. Then the photon is destroyed, and the positron and two electrons move off at equal speeds in the same direction as the photon. I need to find the energy of the photon, and the options are from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that when a photon interacts with matter, conservation laws come into play—like conservation of energy and momentum. Since the initial electron is at rest, its momentum is zero. The photon has energy and momentum. When it creates an electron-positron pair, the system's total energy and momentum must be conserved.

Wait, the photon is destroyed, so all its energy goes into the system. The initial system is just the electron at rest, and the photon. After the collision, we have two electrons and a positron. Oh wait, no, wait. The problem says the positron and two electrons move off. So initially, there was one electron; after the collision, there are two electrons and a positron. So the total number of particles increases, but that's okay because the photon's energy creates mass.

Let me think about conservation of energy. The initial energy is the energy of the photon plus the rest mass energy of the electron. The rest mass energy of the electron is mc². So initial energy is E_photon + mc².

After the collision, the energy is the rest mass energy of the three particles plus their kinetic energy. Wait, but three particles? No. Wait, the initial photon creates an electron-positron pair, so the original electron is still there? Or does the photon convert into the pair, and the initial electron is annihilated? Hmm, the question says "strikes an electron of mass m that is initially at rest, creating an electron-positron pair." So perhaps the photon hits the electron, and the electron is part of the reaction. So maybe the process is photon + electron → two electrons and a positron. Or maybe the electron is part of the pair? Wait, no, the initial electron is there. So initial particles: electron and photon. After, the particles are two electrons and a positron. So the total mass increases by the mass of the positron and an electron? Because initially, there was one electron, and after, there are two electrons and a positron.

Wait, the positron has the same mass as the electron, right? So the initial system has energy: E_photon + mc² (since the electron is at rest). After, the energy is the sum of the rest energies plus kinetic energy. The rest energy would be 2mc² (for the two electrons) plus mc² (for the positron), so 3mc² in rest mass energy. Plus the kinetic energies of all three particles.

But wait, the problem says the positron and two electrons move off at equal speeds along the initial direction. So their speeds are the same. Let me denote their speed as v, and since they're moving in the same direction as the photon, which is the initial direction.

But wait, the initial photon is moving, say, along the x-axis. So the initial momentum is all from the photon. The momentum of the photon is E_photon / c, since for a photon, momentum p = E/c, and since it's moving in the x-direction, its momentum is p_photon = E_photon / c in the x-direction.

After the collision, the three particles (two electrons and a positron) are moving at the same speed v in the same direction. Let me denote their masses as m each. So each has momentum gamma m v, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but they are moving in the same direction as the photon, so their momenta add up. So total momentum after collision is 3 * gamma m v, because there are three particles each with momentum gamma m v.

Conservation of momentum says the initial momentum (from photon) equals the final momentum (from the three particles). So:

E_photon / c = 3 gamma m v.

Now, for energy conservation. The initial energy is E_photon + mc² (the electron's rest energy). The final energy is the sum of the rest energies plus the kinetic energies. The rest energies are 3mc² (each particle has mc²). So:

E_photon + mc² = 3mc² + (kinetic energies of all three particles).

Kinetic energy for each particle is (gamma - 1) mc². So total kinetic energy is 3 (gamma - 1) mc².

Putting it together:

E_photon + mc² = 3mc² + 3 (gamma - 1) mc².

Simplify that:

E_photon + mc² = 3mc² + 3 gamma mc² - 3 mc².

Wait, 3 (gamma - 1) mc² = 3 gamma mc² - 3 mc².

So the right side becomes 3mc² + 3 gamma mc² - 3 mc² = 3 gamma mc².

So the equation becomes:

E_photon + mc² = 3 gamma mc².

From the momentum equation, E_photon = 3 gamma m v c.

Wait, no. Momentum equation: E_photon / c = 3 gamma m v.

So E_photon = 3 gamma m v c.

Let me substitute E_photon from the momentum equation into the energy equation.

So:

3 gamma m v c + mc² = 3 gamma mc².

Divide both sides by mc²:

3 gamma v (c) / c + 1 = 3 gamma.

Wait, 3 gamma m v c is E_photon, which is 3 gamma m v c.

So when I divide by mc²:

(3 gamma m v c) / (mc²) + 1 = 3 gamma (m c²)/(m c²).

Simplify:

3 gamma v / c + 1 = 3 gamma.

Hmm, because (3 gamma m v c) / (mc²) = 3 gamma v / c.

So:

3 (gamma) (v/c) + 1 = 3 gamma.

Let me write that as:

3 gamma (v/c) = 3 gamma - 1.

Hmm, let's rearrange:

3 gamma (v/c) - 3 gamma = -1.

Factor out 3 gamma:

3 gamma (v/c - 1) = -1.

Hmm, that seems a bit tricky. Let me see if I can express v in terms of gamma.

We know that gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Let me denote beta = v/c. Then gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²).

So our equation becomes:

3 gamma beta + 1 = 3 gamma.

Rearranged:

3 gamma beta = 3 gamma - 1.

Divide both sides by 3 gamma (assuming gamma is not zero, which it isn't):

beta = 1 - (1/(3 gamma)).

Hmm, I'm not sure if this is the best approach. Maybe I can express gamma in terms of beta and substitute.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find beta in terms of gamma from the momentum equation and then substitute.

Wait, from the momentum equation, E_photon = 3 gamma m v c.

But E_photon is also the energy of the photon, which is equal to its momentum times c: E_photon = p_photon c = (E_photon / c) * c, which checks out.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the energy and momentum equations together.

We have two equations:

1. E_photon = 3 gamma m v c.

2. E_photon + mc² = 3 gamma mc².

From equation 2, E_photon = 3 gamma mc² - mc².

So E_photon = mc² (3 gamma - 1).

Substitute into equation 1:

mc² (3 gamma - 1) = 3 gamma m v c.

Divide both sides by m c:

c (3 gamma -1) = 3 gamma v.

Divide both sides by c:

3 gamma - 1 = 3 gamma (v/c).

Let me denote beta = v/c again.

So:

3 gamma - 1 = 3 gamma beta.

Rearranged:

3 gamma (1 - beta) = 1.

Hmm, that's a bit better.

But gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²).

So substitute gamma:

3 [1 / sqrt(1 - beta²)] (1 - beta) = 1.

Let me expand this:

3 (1 - beta) / sqrt(1 - beta²) ) = 1.

Note that sqrt(1 - beta²) is sqrt((1 - beta)(1 + beta)).

So sqrt(1 - beta²) = sqrt( (1 - beta)(1 + beta) ) = sqrt(1 - beta) * sqrt(1 + beta).

So the equation becomes:

3 (1 - beta) / [ sqrt(1 - beta) * sqrt(1 + beta) ) ] = 1.

Simplify numerator and denominator:

(1 - beta) / sqrt(1 - beta) = sqrt(1 - beta).

Because (1 - beta) is [sqrt(1 - beta)]².

So:

3 sqrt(1 - beta) / sqrt(1 + beta) ) = 1.

Let me write it as:

3 sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) = 1.

Divide both sides by 3:

sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) = 1/3.

Square both sides:

(1 - beta)/(1 + beta) = 1/9.

Cross-multiplying:

9 (1 - beta) = 1 + beta.

9 - 9 beta = 1 + beta.

Bring like terms together:

9 -1 = 9 beta + beta.

8 = 10 beta.

beta = 8/10 = 4/5.

So beta = 0.8, meaning v = 0.8c.

Now, let's compute gamma.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (16/25)) = 1 / sqrt(9/25) = 1/(3/5) )= 5/3.

So gamma is 5/3.

Now, let's find E_photon from equation 2:

E_photon = mc² (3 gamma -1).

gamma is 5/3, so 3 gamma = 5.

So 3 gamma -1 = 5-1=4.

Thus, E_photon = 4 mc².

Wait, looking at the options, option J is 4mc². So the answer should be J.

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, earlier steps: when I substituted everything, beta came out to be 4/5, which is 0.8c. Gamma was 5/3. Then E_photon = mc² (3*(5/3) -1 )= mc² (5-1) =4 mc². That seems correct.

So the photon's energy is 4mc², which is option J.

The problem involves a photon striking an electron at rest, creating an electron-positron pair. The photon's energy must be determined using conservation of energy and momentum.

Initially, the system consists of an electron at rest and a photon with energy \( E_{\text{photon}} \). After the collision, the system includes two electrons and a positron, all moving at equal speeds \( v \) in the direction of the photon. 

### Conservation of Momentum
The photon's momentum is \( \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} \), and after the collision, the total momentum of the three particles is \( 3\gamma mv \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Equating initial and final momentum:
\[
\frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = 3\gamma mv.
\]

### Conservation of Energy
The initial energy is \( E_{\text{photon}} + mc^2 \) (the electron's rest energy). The final energy includes the rest energy of the three particles and their kinetic energy:
\[
E_{\text{photon}} + mc^2 = 3mc^2 + 3(\gamma - 1)mc^2.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
E_{\text{photon}} + mc^2 = 3\gamma mc^2.
\]

### Solving for \( E_{\text{photon}} \)
From the momentum equation:
\[
E_{\text{photon}} = 3\gamma mv c.
\]
Substituting into the energy equation:
\[
3\gamma mv c + mc^2 = 3\gamma mc^2.
\]
Dividing by \( mc^2 \):
\[
3\gamma \frac{v}{c} + 1 = 3\gamma.
\]
Let \( \beta = \frac{v}{c} \), so \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} \). Substituting \( \gamma \) and solving:
\[
3\gamma \beta + 1 = 3\gamma.
\]
Rearranging:
\[
3\gamma (1 - \beta) = 1.
\]
Substituting \( \gamma \):
\[
3\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}(1 - \beta) = 1.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
3\sqrt{\frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta}} = 1.
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
9\frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta} = 1.
\]
Cross-multiplying:
\[
9(1 - \beta) = 1 + \beta.
\]
Solving for \( \beta \):
\[
9 - 9\beta = 1 + \beta \quad \Rightarrow \quad 8 = 10\beta \quad \Rightarrow \quad \beta = \frac{4}{5}.
\]
Thus, \( v = 0.8c \), and:
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.8)^2}} = \frac{5}{3}.
\]
Substituting \( \gamma \) into the energy equation:
\[
E_{\text{photon}} = 3\gamma mc^2 - mc^2 = 3\left(\frac{5}{3}\right)mc^2 - mc^2 = 4mc^2.
\]

Thus, the energy of the photon is \( 4mc^2 \), corresponding to option **J**.
