Question:

A ski resort had a lift that carried customers from the bottom to the top of the ski slope. One afternoon, the lift suddenly broke down because of a power failure in the area. A customer was suspended in his lift chair, one-third of the way up the hill and 50 feet above the ground. The customer remained on the lift for five hours until power was restored. He was then returned uninjured to the bottom of the hill. In a suit against the ski resort, the customer is likely to have action for

Options:

B: assault.
C: false imprisonment.
D: invasion of privacy.
E: negligence.
F: battery.
G: breach of contract.
H: defamation.
I: no cause of action.
J: trespass.

Okay, so I've got this question about tort law, and I need to figure out what cause of action the customer might have against the ski resort. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: A ski resort's lift breaks down due to a power failure. The customer is suspended one-third up the hill and 50 feet above the ground. He stays there for five hours and then is safely returned without injuries. Now, he's suing, and I need to determine the possible tort here.

Looking at the options, I see intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, false imprisonment, invasion of privacy, negligence, battery, breach of contract, defamation, no cause of action, and trespass.

Let me consider each option one by one.

A: Intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED). For IIED, the defendant must act intentionally or recklessly, causing severe emotional distress. Here, the breakdown was due to a power failure, which might be seen as beyond the resort's control. Unless the resort was negligent, it's hard to see intent. So maybe not IIED.

B: Assault. Assault requires an intentional harmful or offensive touching or apprehension of such. The customer wasn't touched, and he wasn't in immediate apprehension of harm because he wasn't moving or in danger beyond being stuck. So assault doesn't seem to fit.

C: False imprisonment. This is about unlawful restraint of movement. The customer was stuck on the lift, but was he confined? The lift is a structure, so he couldn't move freely. But false imprisonment usually involves some force or threat. Here, it was an accident, not intentional. Plus, the time was five hours, but if the resort tried to rescue him, maybe it's not false imprisonment. Or perhaps it is because he was physically restrained.

D: Invasion of privacy. This typically involves unauthorized intrusion into private matters. Being stuck on a lift might not meet the criteria unless there's some prying or unwanted attention, which isn't mentioned here. So probably not.

E: Negligence. The resort has a duty to operate the lift safely. If the power failure was due to their negligence, like lack of backup power, then they might be liable. But if it was an external power issue beyond their control, maybe not. The question doesn't specify, but ski resorts usually have systems in place for such issues. So negligence is a possibility.

F: Battery. Battery requires intentional harmful or offensive contact. The customer wasn't touched; he was stuck. No physical contact, so battery doesn't apply.

G: Breach of contract. The resort provided a service, but a contract breach is more about failing to perform as agreed, which could be a civil claim, but the question is about torts. Plus, breach of contract is a different area.

H: Defamation. This involves false statements harming reputation. There's no mention of any statements made, so defamation isn't relevant here.

I: No cause of action. If none of the torts fit, this could be the case. But I think at least negligence might apply.

J: Trespass. Trespass to chattel involves interfering with personal property. The customer's personal property (maybe his ski gear) wasn't interfered with. Trespass to person would be similar to battery or assault, which don't fit. So trespass isn't likely.

So, considering all options, the most likely tort is negligence. The resort had a duty to provide a safe lift, and if they breached that duty by not having proper backup power, causing the customer to be stranded, that could be negligence. Even though the customer wasn't injured, sometimes fright or distress can be part of negligence claims, though here he wasn't injured physically.

Wait, but false imprisonment requires unlawful restraint. The resort didn't intend to restrain him; it was an accident. So maybe it's not false imprisonment. Also, for false imprisonment, the restraint must be without legal justification. Here, the situation was an emergency, so maybe the resort didn't commit false imprisonment.

Therefore, the best answer seems to be E: negligence.

The customer's situation likely falls under negligence, as the ski resort may have failed to provide a safe environment by not addressing the power failure adequately. 

Answer: E
