Question:

On July 7, Magee Data stock sold at a high of 23(1/8) and a low of 22(5/8). Giant Industrials sold for a high of 24(1/4) and a low of 23(1/2).

Okay, so I've got this problem about Mr. Taylor buying stocks, and I need to figure out the total cost. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when you buy stocks, you pay the higher price for buying at a higher point in the market, but wait, in this case, the prices are given, so I need to calculate the total cost based on the prices he bought at.

So, the problem says Magee Data was sold at a high of 23 1/8 and a low of 22 5/8. Mr. Taylor bought 300 shares of Magee at the high of the day. So, the high is when the price is higher for buying, right? Because usually, you buy at the opening (high) or the latest high before closing. So he bought 300 shares at 23 1/8. 

Then, Giant Indus was sold at a high of 24 1/4 and a low of 23 1/2. Mr. Taylor bought 400 shares of Giant at the low of the day. So, the low is the lowest, so buying at the low makes sense for selling at a higher price. So he bought 400 shares at 23 1/2.

Now I need to calculate the total cost for both stocks and add them together.

First, let's convert these fractions to decimals to make the calculation easier. 

For Magee Data: 23 1/8. 1/8 is 0.125. So 23.125. And Giant: 23 1/2 is 23.5.

Now, compute the cost for each stock.

 Magee Data: 300 shares * 23.125 per share.
Giant: 400 shares * 23.5 per share.

Let me calculate Magee first.

300 * 23.125. Let's break this down. 23.125 is the same as 23 + 0.125. So, 300 * 23 = 6900, and 300 * 0.125 = 37.5. So total is 6900 + 37.5 = 6937.5.

Now, Giant: 400 * 23.5. 23.5 is the same as 23 + 0.5. So 400 *23=9200, 400 *0.5=200. So total is 9200 +200=9400.

Now add both costs together: 6937.5 (Magee) +9400 (Giant) = 16337.5.

So the total cost is $16,337.50. Looking at the options, option I is $16,337.50, which should be the correct answer.

The correct calculation involves converting the fractional prices to decimals and using the quantities Mr. Taylor purchased. Magee Data was bought at 23.125 per share for 300 shares, calculating to 6937.5. Giant Industrials were bought at 23.5 for 400 shares, totaling 9400. Adding these gives a total cost of $16,337.50.

Answer: I: $16,337.50
