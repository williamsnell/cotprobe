Question:

Which statement about intestinal "brakes" and "accelerators" is FALSE?


Options:

C: The arrival of lipid in the duodenum causes an immediate reduction in motility and a switch from the "fasting" to the "feeding" pattern.
D: Food in the stomach causes gastrin release, which stimulates acid secretion
E: Protein ingestion leads to immediate increase in intestinal motility
F: Gastric acid secretion inhibits small intestinal motility
G: The presence of bile in the intestine slows down motility
H: The presence of undigested food in the colon stimulates intestinal motility
I: Dietary starch is a potent stimulator of small intestinal motility because it causes insulin release from the pancreas
J: The presence of glucose in the duodenum accelerates intestinal motility

Okay, so I have this question about intestinal "brakes" and "accelerators." I need to figure out which statement is false. Let's go through each option one by one.

First, the question is about identifying the false statement regarding intestinal mechanisms that either accelerate or slow down motility. Intestinal accelerators increase motility, while brakes decrease it.

Option A: Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) refluxing from the colon to the caecum promote ileo-caecal motility. I remember that SCFAs are produced by gut bacteria and can stimulate motility. They might also influence the migrating motor complex, so this seems plausible. Not sure yet if it's false.

Option B: Fiber in the colon increases motility and switches to a feeding pattern. Fiber can bulk up the stool and stimulate peristalsis, which makes sense. The colon might switch from fasting to feeding mode when there's content, so this seems true.

Option C: Lipid in the duodenum causes immediate reduction in motility and switches to feeding. Wait, when lipids are present, I think they stimulate the release of hormones like cholecystokinin (CCK), which usually increase motility. Or does it reduce? Or maybe it slows down because digestion needs time. I'm a bit confused here. I thought lipids might slow motility because they're being digested, but I'm not sure if it's an immediate reduction. Alternatively, maybe it's the oppositeâ€”like, they trigger more activity. Need to think more.

Option D: Food in the stomach causes gastrin release, which stimulates acid. Yes, that's correct. Gastrin is released in response to food in the stomach, promoting acid secretion, so this is true.

Option E: Protein ingestion leads to immediate increase in motility. Proteins are broken down into amino acids, which can stimulate the release of hormones like insulin and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). These can increase motility. So this seems correct.

Option F: Gastric acid inhibits small intestinal motility. I think that's right because when the stomach is acidic, it might signal the small intestine to slow motility to allow better absorption. Or is it the other way around? Maybe it's more about the presence of food in the small intestine. Not entirely sure, but I'll note it as possibly true.

Option G: Bile presence slows motility. Bile is released into the small intestine to help digest fats. I think it might help in emulsifying fats, but does it slow motility? Or does it promote it? I'm not certain, but I'll think about how bile is secreted when needed, so maybe it doesn't slow it down.

Option H: Undigested food in the colon stimulates motility. That makes sense because the body would try to move it along if there's leftover material, so this is probably true.

Option I: Starch is a potent stimulator because it causes insulin release. Starch is broken down into glucose, which can cause insulin to rise. But does insulin affect gut motility? I recall that incretin hormones like GLP-1 are more directly involved in stimulating motility. Also, dietary starch might be broken down into glucose, which could inhibit motility because high blood sugar might slow things down (like the ileal brake). So this statement might be false because insulin isn't the main driver here.

Option J: Glucose in the duodenum accelerates motility. I think that when glucose is present, it can stimulate the release of hormones that increase motility. Or wait, high glucose might inhibit motility as part of the ileal brake mechanism. Hmm. When glucose is detected in the ileum, it slows motility to allow more time for absorption. But if it's in the duodenum, maybe it's part of the initial phase. I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe glucose in the duodenum accelerates motility to move it further down for absorption.

Wait, the question is about accelerators and brakes. So accelerators increase motility. Let's think about each option again.

Option C: Arrival of lipid in duodenum causes reduction and switch to feeding. Wait, when lipid is present, CCK is released, which usually increases motility. So if it causes a reduction, that would be false. Or maybe it's the opposite.

Option I: Starch causes insulin release, which is a potent stimulator. But I'm not sure if insulin directly increases motility. More likely, the breakdown products (like glucose) might affect it through other mechanisms. So option I could be false because starch's effect is more via incretin hormones, not insulin.

Option J: Glucose in duodenum accelerates motility. If glucose is in the duodenum, it might trigger the release of GLP-1 and GIP, which increase motility. So that's probably true.

Wait, back to option C. The arrival of lipid in duodenum. I think that when lipids enter the small intestine, they trigger the release of CCK, which causes contraction of the ileum and can slow gastric emptying (brake). So if the statement says it causes an immediate reduction in motility, that would be correct because CCK slows things down. But the statement says it switches from fasting to feeding. Hmm, not sure about that part. Maybe the fasting to feeding refers to the pattern of motility.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of lipid in the duodenum would increase motility. Wait, no, CCK actually slows gastric emptying as a brake but may have different effects on small intestinal motility. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Option I: Dietary starch is a potent stimulator because it causes insulin. I'm more confident now that this is false because starch's effect is more about glucose absorption and the resulting ileal brake (slowing motility when glucose is present). So the statement in I is incorrect because it's not insulin causing the stimulation but possibly other factors, and in fact, high glucose might slow motility.

Option J: Presence of glucose in duodenum accelerates motility. If glucose is detected early, maybe it's part of the initial phase, but I think the ileal brake (when glucose is in the ileum) slows motility. So if glucose is in the duodenum, maybe it's part of the feeding phase and accelerates motility. Not entirely sure.

Wait, the question is about what's false. So which statements are false.

Looking back, option I says that dietary starch is a potent stimulator because it causes insulin release. But I think starch is broken down into glucose, and high glucose levels (especially in the ileum) act as an ileal brake, slowing motility. So the statement in I is incorrect because it's not insulin causing the stimulation; instead, the presence of glucose might slow motility. Therefore, option I is false.

Another possibility: option C says lipid arrival causes reduction in motility and switches to feeding. If CCK is released, which slows motility (brake), that would align with this statement. But I'm not certain if it's the correct mechanism. Alternatively, maybe lipid arrival increases motility, making option C false.

I'm a bit confused, but I think the key is in option I. Because insulin isn't the main driver for intestinal motility in response to starch. Instead, it's more about the presence of glucose and the hormones it triggers, which might slow motility. So option I is the false statement.

The question asks which statement about intestinal "brakes" and "accelerators" is false. To determine this, each option was analyzed:

- **Option A**: Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) promote ileo-caecal motility. This is plausible as SCFAs can influence motility and the migrating motor complex.
- **Option B**: Fiber in the colon increases motility and switches to a feeding pattern. This is true as fiber bulk can stimulate peristalsis.
- **Option C**: Lipid in the duodenum causes immediate reduction in motility. This is questionable, as lipids may stimulate CCK, which can slow motility, but the statement seems accurate.
- **Option D**: Food in the stomach causes gastrin release. This is correct, as gastrin stimulates acid secretion.
- **Option E**: Protein ingestion increases motility. This is true, as proteins can trigger hormone release that enhances motility.
- **Option F**: Gastric acid inhibits small intestinal motility. This is plausible, as acid may signal the small intestine to slow motility.
- **Option G**: Bile slows motility. This is uncertain, as bile aids digestion but may not directly slow motility.
- **Option H**: Undigested food in the colon stimulates motility. This is likely true, as the body moves undigested material along.
- **Option I**: Starch stimulates motility via insulin release. This is false, as starch's effect is more about glucose absorption and the ileal brake, not insulin.
- **Option J**: Glucose in the duodenum accelerates motility. This is plausible, as glucose may trigger hormones that increase motility.

The false statement is **Option I**, as starch's effect is not primarily due to insulin but rather glucose absorption and the ileal brake mechanism, which slows motility.

**Answer: I**
