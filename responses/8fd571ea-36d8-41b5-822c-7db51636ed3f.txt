Okay, so I've got this economics question here about the reserve ratio and how a withdrawal affects the money in circulation. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the reserve ratio is given as 0.10, which I believe is 10%. That means that banks are required to keep 10% of their deposits as reserves and can lend out the remaining 90%. So, if someone withdraws money from their checking account, how does that affect the overall money supply?

The question says Mommy Morebucks withdraws $1 million and keeps it as cash in her fridge. So she's taking money out of her checking account and holding it as physical cash. Now, I remember that money in circulation includes physical cash and demand deposits (like checking accounts). When she withdraws the money, she's reducing her demand deposits but increasing her cash holdings.

Wait, but how does this affect the banks? The bank where she had the $1 million would have less deposits. Since the reserve ratio is 10%, the bank must hold 10% of that as reserves. So initially, the bank had $1 million in deposits, keeping $100,000 as reserves and could lend out $900,000. But when she withdraws the $1 million, the bank's deposits drop by $1 million. That means the bank's reserves would also drop by $100,000 because they're keeping 10% of the new, lower deposit amount.

But wait, when she takes the money out, the bank's reserves decrease by $100,000 because she's removing $1 million, and 10% of that is $100k. So the bank's reserves go down by $100k. Does that mean the bank has to reduce its lending? Because if they have less reserves, they might have to call back loans or reduce new loans. 

When banks lend less, it affects the money supply because loans are a form of money creation. When banks lend, they create new money through fractional reserve banking. So if they can't lend as much because their reserves are lower, the money multiplier effect would decrease. The money multiplier is 1/(reserve ratio), which in this case is 1/0.10 = 10. So, a $100k decrease in reserves would lead to a potential decrease in the money supply by $100k * 10 = $1 million.

Wait, but Mommy is just holding the cash now, so that $1 million is no longer in the banking system. But does the cash still count as part of the money supply? Yes, because M1 includes physical currency and demand deposits. So when she withdraws it, her demand deposits go down by $1 million, but her cash goes up by $1 million. So the total M1 remains the same? Or does the money in circulation decrease because the bank can't create as much through lending?

I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. The reserve ratio is 10%, so the bank's required reserves are 10% of deposits. When she withdraws $1 million, the bank's deposits fall by $1 million, so their required reserves fall by $100k. That means the bank can't lend out as much as before. The previous lending capacity was based on $1 million deposits, which allowed $900k in loans. Now, with $0 deposits (since she took out all $1 million), the bank's lending capacity drops to zero. Wait, no, she withdrew $1 million, so the deposits are now $0? That seems extreme. Maybe she kept some money, but the question says she withdraws $1 million entirely.

Wait, no, the question says she withdraws $1 million from her checking account, so her account goes down by $1 million, and the bank's deposits go down by that amount. So the bank's reserves must also decrease by 10% of $1 million, which is $100k. So the bank's reserves are now lower. Because banks need to maintain the reserve ratio, if their deposits drop, their required reserves drop. So the bank's excess reserves (money they can lend) would also decrease.

When the bank can't lend as much, the money creation process slows down. The money multiplier effect tells us that a decrease in reserves leads to a proportional decrease in the money supply. So a $100k decrease in reserves would lead to a $1 million decrease in the money supply (since 1/0.10 is 10). 

But wait, Mommy took out the $1 million as cash. So the total money in circulation would include her cash. But the bank's ability to create money through lending is reduced. So the net effect is that the money supply in circulation (M1) might decrease because the bank can't lend out as much as before. The initial withdrawal reduces the bank's deposits, which in turn reduces their ability to lend, thus reducing the money supply.

Alternatively, if she just holds the cash, the $1 million is still part of the money supply, but the bank can't use it to create more money through lending. So the total money in circulation might not change because the cash is still there, but the potential for more money creation is reduced.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to break it down:

1. Mommy withdraws $1 million, so her checking account (part of M1) decreases by $1 million.
2. The bank's deposits decrease by $1 million, so their reserves (10% of deposits) decrease by $100k.
3. The bank's excess reserves (lendable money) decrease by $900k (since they had $900k in loans before and now can't do that anymore).
4. When the bank can't lend $900k, the money supply decreases by $900k * 10 (the multiplier) = $9 million? Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, no, the money multiplier effect is applied to the change in reserves. So if reserves decrease by $100k, the money supply decreases by $100k * 10 = $1 million. So the total money in circulation would decrease by $1 million.

But wait, Mommy's cash is part of M1, so the $1 million is still in circulation as cash. So does that mean the total M1 remains the same? Because she took it out of her account and put it in her fridge, so the money is still in the economy.

Hmm, this is confusing. I think I need to clarify: when money is just moved from a demand deposit to cash, the money supply (M1) doesn't change because both are part of M1. But if the bank's reserves are reduced, the bank can't create as much new money through lending, which affects the potential money supply.

Wait, but the question asks about the potential impact. So the immediate action is she takes $1 million out of her account and holds it as cash. The bank's reserves go down by $100k, which reduces their ability to lend. The potential money creation is reduced, leading to a decrease in the money supply.

Alternatively, maybe the money supply in circulation remains the same because the cash is still in circulation. The bank's reserves are lower, but the money is just moved around, not destroyed.

I think the key here is whether the withdrawal affects the bank's ability to create new money. Since she's holding cash, the bank can't use that $1 million to make loans, so the money creation process is reduced. The reserve ratio is 10%, so the total potential money creation would be $1 million / 0.10 = $10 million. But she's only taking out $1 million, so the impact would be $1 million * 10 = $10 million decrease? No, that can't be right because she's only taking out $1 million.

Wait, no. The reserve ratio is 10%, so for every $1 in reserves, the bank can create $10 in money. So if the bank's reserves decrease by $100k, the money supply would decrease by $1 million. But in this case, she's taking out $1 million, so the bank's reserves drop by $100k, leading to a potential $1 million decrease in the money supply.

But wait, she's holding the $1 million as cash, which is part of M1. So the total M1 doesn't change because the money is still in circulation. The bank's ability to create more money is reduced, but the existing money is still there.

Hmm, this is tricky. I think the answer might be that the money in circulation decreases by $1 million because the bank can't create as much new money, but the immediate cash is still there. Or maybe it's a $100k decrease because that's the change in reserves.

Wait, no, the question is about the potential impact. So the potential decrease would be based on the reserves lost, which is $100k, leading to a $1 million decrease in the money supply.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me try to structure it:

- Withdrawal: $1 million from checking (M1 decreases by $1 million, but she holds it as cash, so M1 doesn't change? Or does it? Because M1 includes cash and checking. So if she moves $1 million from checking to cash, M1 remains the same. But the bank's reserves drop by $100k, so the bank can't create $900k in loans, leading to a $900k decrease in the money supply.

Wait, that would be a decrease of $900k, but that's not one of the options. The options are in millions: A is $9M, D is $1M, E is $10M, etc.

Alternatively, the money multiplier effect applies to the change in reserves. The change in reserves is -$100k. So the change in money supply is $100k * 10 = -$1M. So the money in circulation decreases by $1 million.

But since she's holding the cash, the money is still in circulation. So maybe the money supply doesn't change. Or does it?

Wait, no. The money supply includes both cash and demand deposits. When she withdraws $1 million, her demand deposits go down by $1M, and her cash goes up by $1M. So M1 remains the same. But the bank's reserves are lower, so they can't lend as much, which affects the potential for future money creation. But the question is about the potential impact, so it's about the effect on the money supply due to the bank's reduced lending ability.

So the change in the money supply would be the decrease in the money created through lending. The change in reserves is -$100k, leading to a change in money supply of -$1M.

So the answer should be a decrease of $1 million, which is option G.
</think>

The reserve ratio is 0.10, meaning banks must keep 10% of deposits as reserves. When Mommy Morebucks withdraws $1 million from her checking account, the bank's deposits decrease by $1 million, and its reserves (10% of deposits) drop by $100,000. This reduction in reserves limits the bank's ability to lend, as it can no longer create new money through lending. The money multiplier effect, which is 1/(reserve ratio) = 10, amplifies this reduction. A $100,000 decrease in reserves leads to a potential $1 million decrease in the money supply. Although the $1 million is still in circulation as cash, the bank's reduced lending capacity lowers the potential for money creation, resulting in a $1 million decrease in the money supply.
