Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the uncertainty in the position of an electron. Hmm, I remember that this has to do with the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says the speed of the electron is 1 × 10^6 m/s, and the measurement precision has an uncertainty of 1 percent. I need to find out how precisely the position can be determined simultaneously. The options are from A to J, so I'll need to calculate and choose the correct one.

First, I recall that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp). The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s.

But wait, I don't have Δp directly. I have the uncertainty in speed, which is 1% of the given speed. So I should find the uncertainty in velocity (Δv) first. The speed is 1e6 m/s, so 1% of that is 1e4 m/s. So Δv = 1e4 m/s.

Momentum (p) is mass times velocity (p = mv). The mass of an electron is about 9.11 × 10^-31 kg. So the uncertainty in momentum Δp would be m * Δv. Let me calculate that: 9.11e-31 kg * 1e4 m/s = 9.11e-27 kg·m/s.

Wait, wait, no, I think I made a mistake there. Because Δp is mΔv, right? Oh, yeah, that's correct. So yes, 9.11e-31 * 1e4 = 9.11e-27 kg·m/s.

Now, using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: Δx ≥ ħ/(2Δp). Plugging in the numbers, ħ is approximately 1.055e-34 J·s. So:

Δx ≥ (1.055e-34) / (2 * 9.11e-27)

Let me compute the denominator first: 2 * 9.11e-27 = 1.822e-26.

Now, divide 1.055e-34 by 1.822e-26.

Hmm, 1.055 / 1.822 is approximately 0.579, and 1e-34 / 1e-26 is 1e-8. So 0.579e-8 meters, which is 5.79e-9 meters.

Looking at the options, option C is 5.8 × 10^-9 m, which matches this calculation. So I think the correct answer is option C.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations. Oh, wait, maybe I should be more precise with the constants.

Let me recalculate:

Δv = 1e6 m/s * 0.01 = 1e4 m/s.

Mass of electron, m = 9.11e-31 kg.

Δp = m * Δv = 9.11e-31 * 1e4 = 9.11e-27 kg·m/s.

Now, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So Δx = ħ/(2Δp) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 9.11e-27) )

Compute denominator: 2 * 9.11e-27 = 1.822e-26.

Divide numerator by denominator: 1.0545718e-34 / 1.822e-26 = (1.0545718 / 1.822) * 1e-8.

Calculating 1.0545718 / 1.822: Let's see, 1.822 is about 1.82, so 1.05457 / 1.82 ≈ 0.579.

So 0.579e-8 m = 5.79e-9 m, which is approximately 5.8e-9 m. So yes, that's option C.

I think that makes sense. So the position uncertainty is around 5.8e-9 meters, which is option C.

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) as Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ ≈ 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. Given the electron's speed is 1 × 10^6 m/s with a 1% uncertainty, Δv = 1 × 10^4 m/s. The uncertainty in momentum Δp = mΔv = (9.11 × 10^-31 kg)(1 × 10^4 m/s) = 9.11 × 10^-27 kg·m/s. Substituting into the uncertainty principle, Δx ≥ ħ/(2Δp) = (1.0545718 × 10^-34) / (2 × 9.11 × 10^-27) ≈ 5.8 × 10^-9 m. Thus, the position uncertainty is approximately 5.8 × 10^-9 m, corresponding to option C.
