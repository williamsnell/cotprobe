Okay, so I need to figure out why Singer presents his three-premise argument along with the drowning child case. Let me start by recalling what I know about Singer's work, especially his argument for donating to charity to save lives.

Singer's argument is based on a utilitarian perspective, where we should act to maximize overall happiness or reduce suffering. The three premises probably outline the reasoning behind why we should help others. The first premise is about our capacity to prevent suffering, the second about the equality of suffering, and the third about the moral obligation to help those within our means.

Now, the drowning child scenario is often used to illustrate a point about moral responsibility. The idea is that if you see a child drowning and you can save them without much trouble, you're morally obligated to do so. This is a concrete, emotional example that makes the abstract argument more relatable.

So, why does he use both the three-premise argument and the drowning child example? Well, the premises are abstract and logical, providing a structured reasoning for why we should help. The drowning child adds an emotional layer, making the argument more compelling by appealing to our feelings.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one captures both the logical and emotional appeal. Option E says he wants to show that moral obligations come from both rational arguments and emotional responses. That makes sense because he uses both. Option I says he aims to appeal to both logical and emotional aspects of the reader's mind, which also fits. Option J suggests that combining argument and emotion is more effective than using either alone, which is also a possibility.

I think the key here is that Singer uses both to cover different aspects of persuasion. The logical premises provide the foundation, while the emotional example makes it more tangible. So, he's balancing both reason and emotion to strengthen his case. 

Looking again, option E talks about the sources of moral obligations, while option I is about appealing to both aspects. I think the question is about why he uses both, so it's more about the method of persuasion rather than the sources of obligations. Therefore, option I seems more accurate because he's targeting both the reader's reasoning and emotions. Alternatively, option J says the combination is more effective, which is also true but perhaps a bit more about the effectiveness rather than the purpose of using both.

The answer is **I**. Singer uses both the three-premise argument and the drowning child example to appeal to both the logical and emotional aspects of the reader's mind, making his argument more compelling by balancing reason and emotion.
