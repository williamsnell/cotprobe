Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

So, the problem says there's a rain cloud with a water volume of 10^5 liters. A chemical factory nearby is releasing SO3 into the air. Each SO3 molecule bonds with one out of 10^4 H2O molecules to form H2SO4. We need to find the molarity of H2SO4 in the cloud. The options are A through J, with various molarity values.

First, I remember that molarity is moles of solute divided by liters of solution. In this case, the solute is H2SO4, and the solution is the rainwater from the cloud.

Wait, but the problem doesn't mention the amount of SO3 released. Hmm. Oh, maybe it's assuming that the amount of SO3 is the limiting factor? Or perhaps it's given implicitly because each SO3 molecule reacts with one H2O molecule. Let me think.

So, each SO3 molecule bonds with one H2O molecule to form H2SO4. The reaction would be: SO3 + H2O → H2SO4. So, each mole of SO3 produces one mole of H2SO4.

But wait, the problem says each SO3 molecule bonds with one out of 10^4 H2O molecules. Oh, that's an important detail. So, the fraction of H2O molecules reacting with SO3 is 1/10^4. That means, for every 10,000 H2O molecules, only one reacts with an SO3 molecule.

But I'm not sure how that affects the concentration. Let me break it down.

The cloud has 10^5 liters of water. Let's assume that the density of water is approximately 1 kg per liter, so the mass of water is 10^5 kg, which is 10^5 * 1000 grams = 1e8 grams. But wait, maybe we don't need the mass. Maybe we can work with moles.

The number of moles of H2O in 10^5 liters of water. The molar mass of H2O is about 18 g/mol. So, the number of moles is (mass) / (molar mass). Mass is 1e5 liters * 1000 g/liter = 1e8 grams. So moles H2O = 1e8 g / 18 g/mol ≈ 5.5556e6 mol. Wait, but that's a lot. Let me calculate that more accurately.

Wait, 1e5 liters is 100,000 liters. Each liter is about 55.5556 moles of H2O (since 1000g / 18g/mol ≈ 55.5556). So, 100,000 liters * 55.5556 mol/L ≈ 5.55556e6 mol. So, about 5.556e6 moles of H2O.

Now, the fraction of H2O molecules reacting is 1/10^4. So, the number of H2O molecules that react is (total H2O moles) * (1/1e4). Let me compute that.

5.556e6 mol * (1/1e4) = 5.556e6 / 1e4 = 555.6 mol. So, about 555.6 moles of H2O react. But since each SO3 molecule reacts with one H2O molecule, that means the number of moles of SO3 is the same as the moles of H2SO4 formed, right? Because each SO3 gives one H2SO4.

Wait, no. Wait, each SO3 molecule reacts with one H2O to form one H2SO4. So, the moles of H2SO4 would be equal to the moles of SO3, which is equal to the moles of H2O that reacted, which is 555.6 mol.

Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me think again. The problem states that each SO3 molecule bonds with one out of 10^4 H2O molecules. So, for each SO3 molecule, it bonds with one H2O out of 1e4. So, the number of H2O that react is equal to the number of SO3 molecules. So, if N is the number of SO3 molecules, then the number of H2O molecules that react is N * 1 (since each SO3 binds to one H2O). But wait, that's not matching with the earlier approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify the problem statement again.

Each SO3 molecule bonds with one H2O molecule out of 1e4 H2O. So, the chance that a given H2O molecule will bond with an SO3 is 1/1e4. So, the fraction of H2O that reacts is 1/1e4.

So, total H2O in the cloud is 1e5 liters. Let me find the total moles of H2O: as before, 1e5 liters * 55.5556 mol/L ≈ 5.556e6 mol.

The moles of H2O that react would be 5.556e6 * (1/1e4) = 555.6 mol.

Each of these reacts with one SO3 to form one H2SO4 molecule. So, moles of H2SO4 formed = 555.6 mol.

Now, the volume of the solution is 1e5 liters. So, molarity is moles / liters = 555.6 mol / 1e5 L = 0.005556 M, which is 5.556e-3 M.

Looking at the options, option J is 5.5 × 10^-3 M. So, that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Total H2O in 1e5 liters: 55.5556 mol/L * 1e5 L = 5.5556e6 mol.

Fraction reacting: 1/1e4. So, 5.5556e6 / 1e4 = 555.56 mol H2SO4.

Molarity = 555.56 mol / 1e5 L = 0.0055556 M ≈ 5.56e-3 M, which rounds to 5.5 ×10^-3 M, which is option J.

The problem involves determining the molarity of H₂SO₄ in a rain cloud where each SO₃ molecule reacts with one out of 10⁴ H₂O molecules. 

1. **Total H₂O in the cloud**:  
   The cloud contains 10⁵ liters of water. Assuming the density of water is 1 kg/L, the mass of water is 10⁵ kg or 10⁸ g. The number of moles of H₂O is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of H₂O} = \frac{10^8 \, \text{g}}{18 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 5.556 \times 10^6 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

2. **Moles of H₂O that react**:  
   Each SO₃ molecule reacts with one out of 10⁴ H₂O molecules. Thus, the fraction of H₂O that reacts is \( \frac{1}{10^4} \).  
   \[
   \text{Moles of H₂O that react} = 5.556 \times 10^6 \times \frac{1}{10^4} = 555.6 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

3. **Moles of H₂SO₄ formed**:  
   Each reaction produces one mole of H₂SO₄. Therefore, the moles of H₂SO₄ formed are:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of H₂SO₄} = 555.6 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

4. **Molarity of H₂SO₄**:  
   The volume of the cloud is 10⁵ liters. The molarity is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Molarity} = \frac{\text{Moles of H₂SO₄}}{\text{Volume in liters}} = \frac{555.6}{10^5} = 0.005556 \, \text{M} \approx 5.5 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}.
   \]

Thus, the molarity of H₂SO₄ in the cloud is **5.5 × 10⁻³ M**, corresponding to option **J**.

Answer: J
