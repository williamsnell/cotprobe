Okay, so I've got this logic problem to solve. The question is about translating the sentence "Leo is taller than Cathy" into predicate logic. The options are given from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the components of the sentence. The subject is Leo, and the predicate is about being taller than Cathy. So in predicate logic terms, I need to represent this relationship.

The predicate given is Txy, which means "x is taller than y." So, Txy would translate to "x is taller than y."

In the sentence, Leo is the one who is taller, and Cathy is the one being compared. So, Leo is x, and Cathy is y. Therefore, the predicate would be T(Leo, Cathy).

Now, looking at the options, each option is a combination of letters and symbols. I need to figure out which one correctly represents T(Leo, Cathy).

Looking at the options:

A: TlcL – Hmm, that seems off because I don't see where the second L comes in. Maybe it's a typo, but I'm not sure.

B: cTL – The 'c' at the beginning doesn't fit because Leo is represented by 'l,' not 'c.' So this might be incorrect.

C: lTc – This looks promising. 'l' for Leo, 'T' for the predicate, and 'c' for Cathy. So this would be T(l, c), which is "Leo is taller than Cathy."

D: Tll – Both are 'l's, which would mean Leo is taller than himself, which isn't the case here.

E: cTl – 'c' as the subject doesn't make sense; we need 'l' as the subject.

F: TclC – This has 'T' followed by 'c' and 'l,' but the ending 'C' is confusing. Maybe it's extra, but I'm not sure.

G: Tlc – That's 'T' followed by 'l' and 'c,' so T(l, c). That's the same as option C, right? Wait, no, option C is lTc, which is Leo T Cathy, while option G is Tlc, which is T(l,c). Both seem correct in structure but written differently.

Wait, in predicate logic, the standard way is to write Txy as T(x, y), so it's T followed by the variables. So T(l, c) would be written as Tlc, which is option G. But option C is lTc, which is like l T c, meaning Leo T Cathy, which is the same as T(l, c). So both C and G seem correct, but maybe the way they're written is different.

Wait, no. In standard predicate logic notation, the predicate symbol comes first, followed by the arguments. So T(l, c) is written as Tlc, which would be option G. But option C is lTc, which is like l T c, which is also correct because the order matters. Wait, but in predicate logic, the order is important. So T(l, c) is correct, but lTc is the same as T(l,c), right? Because the predicate is T, and the arguments are l and c. So both C and G are T(l,c) but written differently. Wait, no, option C is lTc, which would be l T c, meaning T(l,c). Option G is Tlc, which is T(l,c). So both C and G are the same in meaning but written differently. But looking back at the options, maybe I'm misreading them.

Wait, the options are labeled as single terms, I think. Let me check again. The options are single terms, so they should be written as a single string. So for example, option C is lTc, which is Leo T Cathy, which is correct. Option G is Tlc, which is T(l,c), which is also correct. So both C and G seem correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, let me think again. The predicate Txy is x is taller than y. So x is the first argument, y is the second. So the correct translation is T(l, c), which is T followed by l and c, making Tlc, which is option G. Alternatively, some notations might write it as lTc, where l is the subject and Tc represents the predicate taking c as the argument. But in standard predicate logic, the function is written as T(l,c), so the correct option would be G: Tlc.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because both C and G seem to represent the same thing but written differently. Let me make sure. Option C is lTc, which is like l T c, which is the same as T(l,c). Option G is Tlc, which is T(l,c). So both are correct, but perhaps the way they're written is different based on notation.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the predicate is given as Txy, so I think the correct way is to write T followed by x and y. So T(l,c) is Tlc, which is option G. So the correct answer should be G.

Wait, but I'm a bit torn because I thought option C was also correct. Let me double-check. The predicate is Txy, so T is the predicate, x is the first argument, y is the second. So the correct way is T(l,c), which is written as Tlc, which is option G. So I think the correct answer is G.

The correct translation of "Leo is taller than Cathy" into predicate logic is T(l, c), which corresponds to option G: Tlc.

Answer: G
