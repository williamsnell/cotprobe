Okay, so I have this question about the relationship between arousal and motivation. Hmm. Let me try to break it down. I remember from my psychology classes that arousal and motivation are related but maybe not the same thing. 

Arousal refers to the state of being physiologically or mentally activated. It's like when you're alert and ready to respond to something. Motivation, on the other hand, is what drives you to do things, right? It's the reason behind your actions. So, motivation pushes you, and arousal is the state that prepares you to act.

The question is asking about their relationship. Let me look at the options. 

Option A says motivation can exist without any arousal. That doesn't sound right. I think motivation usually involves some level of arousal. Like, if you're motivated to do something, you're probably at least a bit aroused, otherwise, you might not feel like doing it.

Option B says arousal level is a central aspect of motivation. That makes sense. Because without being aroused, you might not feel motivated. Like, if you're really tired (low arousal), it's hard to be motivated to do anything. So arousal is a key part of motivation.

Option C claims motivation causes arousal. I'm not so sure about that. It might be the other way around, or they could influence each other. But I think arousal is a prerequisite for motivation, not the other way around.

Option D suggests motivation is a by-product of arousal. That could make sense in some cases. Like when you're aroused, you might feel motivated, but I'm not sure if that's always the case. Motivation seems more intentional, while arousal is more about the state.

Option E says high arousal always maximizes motivation. I don't think that's true because too much arousal can lead to anxiety or stress, which might actually reduce motivation. There's an optimal level, not always high.

Option F says arousal is the same as motivation. That doesn't seem right. They're related but distinct. Arousal is more about the activation level, while motivation is about the drive or reason.

Option G claims motivation decreases with increased arousal. I don't think that's correct. Some tasks require a certain level of arousal. For example, high arousal might help with tasks that need quick reactions, but for others, it might be distracting.

Option H says they're not related. That's definitely wrong because they're both discussed in the context of behavior, so they must be related somehow.

Option I says arousal only affects motivation in physical tasks. That seems too limited. I think arousal affects motivation in all kinds of tasks, not just physical ones.

Putting it all together, the best option seems to be B: Arousal level is a central aspect of motivation. Because without the right level of arousal, motivation isn't as effective. For example, being too low (tired) or too high (overstimulated) can impact how motivated you are to perform tasks.

The relationship between arousal and motivation is complex but interconnected. Arousal refers to the physiological or psychological activation that prepares an individual to respond to stimuli, while motivation drives behavior toward a specific goal. Among the options provided, the most accurate statement is that arousal level is a central aspect of motivation. This is because arousal sets the foundation for motivation; without an appropriate level of arousal, motivation is either absent or less effective. For instance, low arousal may result in lethargy, while excessively high arousal can lead to anxiety or decreased performance. Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: B
