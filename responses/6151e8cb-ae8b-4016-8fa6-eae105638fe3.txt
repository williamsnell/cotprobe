Okay, so I need to figure out how much Mentor Co. should recognize as a foreign currency gain in its income statement. Let me start by understanding the problem.

Mentor is a U.S. corporation that owns 100% of a Swiss corporation. The Swiss franc is the functional currency for the Swiss subsidiary. So, the Swiss company's financial statements are prepared in Swiss francs, and Mentor will translate those into U.S. dollars for consolidation.

The question mentions two gains: a $25,000 gain from remeasurement and a $40,000 gain from the translation of financial statements. I'm a bit confused about what each of these terms means, so I need to break them down.

Remeasurement gainâ€”I think this happens when a parent company converts its investment in a foreign subsidiary from the parent's functional currency (which is the U.S. dollar) to the subsidiary's functional currency (Swiss francs). Wait, no, actually, remeasurement is typically when you have a foreign operation, and you're changing the basis of accounting. For example, if a U.S. company acquires a foreign subsidiary and changes the functional currency, it might remeasure the net assets of the subsidiary at the new functional currency rate. This can create a gain or loss, which is recognized in the income statement.

But in this case, Mentor already owns 100% of the Swiss company, and the functional currency is the Swiss franc. So maybe the remeasurement gain of $25,000 is related to translating the Swiss subsidiary's financial statements into U.S. dollars. Or perhaps it's about adjusting the equity method or something else.

Wait, another thought: when a U.S. company holds a foreign subsidiary, the translation of the subsidiary's financial statements into U.S. dollars can create a foreign currency translation adjustment (FCTA). This adjustment is typically recorded in the equity section, not in the income statement. But wait, sometimes if the parent company has a remeasurement gain or loss, that can affect the income statement.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me recall the accounting standards. According to ASC 830, when a company changes the functional currency of a subsidiary, it must remeasure the net assets of the subsidiary. The difference between the remeasured amount and the original amount is recognized as a gain or loss in the income statement. But in this case, the functional currency is already the Swiss franc, so why is there a remeasurement gain?

Alternatively, perhaps the $25,000 gain is from remeasuring the investment in the Swiss subsidiary when the parent's functional currency changes, but I don't think that's the case here since the parent is U.S., and the subsidiary is Swiss, so their currencies are already different.

Wait, no, maybe the remeasurement is when the parent company, which is U.S., holds an investment in a foreign company. The parent's books are in USD, so when the foreign company's financials are translated into USD, any changes in exchange rates can cause gains or losses. But that's the translation gain.

Hold on, perhaps the $25,000 is a remeasurement gain from another perspective. Maybe when the parent's functional currency is USD, and the subsidiary uses CHF, the parent records its investment in the subsidiary at the historical exchange rate. Then, when the subsidiary's financials are translated, the difference between the historical rate and the current rate could create a translation gain or loss.

Wait, no. The key is that the translation of the financial statements into the parent's currency results in a translation gain. But the translation gain is typically part of the foreign currency translation adjustment, which is reported in the equity section, not the income statement.

But the remeasurement gain is different. If the parent remeasures its investment in the subsidiary due to a change in the functional currency, that gain or loss is recognized in income. But in this case, the functional currency hasn't changed. The subsidiary's functional currency is Swiss franc, so the parent's books would translate the subsidiary's financials into USD each period.

Wait, here's another angle: when you have a foreign operation, you translate its financial statements into the parent's currency. The process involves translating each asset and liability at the current rate, and some income statement items are translated at average rates. The difference between the translated amounts and the original USD amounts (if any) can create a translation adjustment.

But the translation gain mentioned here is $40,000. So perhaps this $40,000 is the translation gain that would go into the equity section. But the remeasurement gain of $25,000 is something else.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up two different concepts. Let's think: when a company remeasures its foreign investments, it's about changing the functional currency. But if the functional currency remains the same, perhaps the remeasurement gain is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the remeasurement gain is part of the process when the parent's functional currency is different from the subsidiary's, and they are consolidating. So when you translate the subsidiary's financials, the exchange rate fluctuations can cause gains or losses.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to structure this.

Mentor Co. (U.S.) owns 100% of a Swiss corp. Swiss franc is the functional currency.

At year-end, two things happened:

1. Remeasurement resulted in a $25,000 gain.

2. Translation of financial statements resulted in a $40,000 gain.

The question is asking about the foreign currency gain to recognize in the income statement.

I think that when you translate the financial statements, the translation gains and losses are typically part of the foreign currency translation adjustment, which is reported in other comprehensive income (OCI), not in the income statement. So the $40,000 translation gain would go to OCI, not the income statement.

But what about the remeasurement gain? Remeasurement is a different process. Remeasurement gains or losses are recognized in the income statement when they occur. So if the remeasurement resulted in a $25,000 gain, that would be in the income statement.

Wait, but why is there a remeasurement gain? Remeasurement usually occurs when there's a change in the functional currency. But here, the functional currency hasn't changed. So perhaps the remeasurement refers to the initial recognition when the parent acquired the subsidiary.

Wait, when a parent company acquires a subsidiary with a different functional currency, it must remeasure the net assets of the subsidiary into the parent's functional currency. The difference between the fair value and the remeasured amount is recognized as a gain or loss in the income statement. So if the remeasurement resulted in a $25,000 gain, that would be part of the income statement.

Additionally, the translation of the financial statements into the parent's currency (USD) can result in a translation gain or loss, which is reported in OCI, not the income statement. So the $40,000 gain from translation would go to OCI, not the income statement.

Wait, but wait a minute. The problem says that the translation resulted in a $40,000 gain. If that's the case, perhaps that's part of the income statement. But I thought translation gains go to OCI.

Wait, no. Typically, the translation adjustment (from translating financial statements) is part of OCI. So the $40,000 gain from translation would be in OCI. Therefore, it wouldn't affect the income statement's foreign currency gain.

But the remeasurement gain of $25,000 would be part of the income statement. So the foreign currency gain in the income statement would be $25,000.

Wait, but the options don't include $25,000 as a standalone. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: 30,000

B:50,000

C:65,000

D:15,000

E:35,000

F:65,000 (duplicate maybe)

G:40,000

H:25,000

I:45,000

J:0

So H is $25,000. So that would be the answer.

But wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the terms. Maybe the remeasurement is part of translation. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the remeasurement gain and the translation gain are both part of the foreign currency gains, and they're added together.

Wait, but in that case, $25,000 + $40,000 = $65,000. But that would be option C, but I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, no. I think the translation gain is part of OCI, so it doesn't go into the income statement. The remeasurement gain is part of the income statement.

So the answer would be $25,000 (option H).

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when you translate the financial statements, the changes in exchange rates can create gains or losses that are part of the income statement, but I think that's not the case. The translation adjustments are usually in OCI.

Alternatively, perhaps the translation gain is part of the income statement. Let me clarify.

From what I remember, when translating the financial statements, the exchange rate differences on monetary assets and liabilities are recognized in the income statement as translation gains or losses. Wait, no, that's not right. The translation of the financial statements involves translating each line item, and the difference between the translated figures and the original (if any) is the translation adjustment, which is an other comprehensive income item.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The process is:

- The subsidiary's financial statements are prepared in CHF.

- To consolidate, they are translated into USD.

- The translation is done using the appropriate exchange rates (current for assets/liabilities, average for income statement items).

- The difference between the translated amounts and the original USD amounts (if any) is the translation adjustment, which is recorded in OCI.

Wait, but in this case, the subsidiary is fully owned, so the translation adjustment would be part of the equity section, not the income statement.

Therefore, the $40,000 translation gain would go into OCI, not the income statement.

The remeasurement gain of $25,000 would be part of the income statement, as remeasurement gains/losses are recognized in net income.

Therefore, the foreign currency gain to recognize in the income statement is $25,000, which is option H.

The question involves determining the foreign currency gain Mentor Co. should recognize in its income statement. Mentor Co., a U.S. corporation, owns 100% of a Swiss corporation whose functional currency is the Swiss franc. Two gains are mentioned: a $25,000 remeasurement gain and a $40,000 translation gain at year-end.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Remeasurement Gain**:  
   Remeasurement gains or losses occur when a parent company changes the functional currency of a subsidiary or remeasures its investment in a foreign subsidiary. In this case, the $25,000 gain is likely related to the remeasurement of the investment in the Swiss subsidiary, which is recognized in the income statement.

2. **Translation Gain**:  
   The translation of the Swiss subsidiary's financial statements into U.S. dollars results in a $40,000 gain. However, translation gains are typically recorded in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI), not the income statement. This is because translation adjustments reflect changes due to exchange rate fluctuations and are considered part of equity, not net income.

3. **Conclusion**:  
   The $25,000 remeasurement gain is recognized in the income statement, while the $40,000 translation gain is recorded in OCI. Therefore, the foreign currency gain to be recognized in the income statement is $25,000.
