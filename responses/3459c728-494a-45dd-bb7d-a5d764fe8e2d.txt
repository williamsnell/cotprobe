Okay, so I have this question about the pattern of inheritance for malignant hyperthermia. Hmm, I remember that it's a medical condition, but I'm not exactly sure about the genetics part. Let me think.

Malignant hyperthermia, sometimes called hyperpyrexia, is a condition that causes a rapid rise in body temperature, right? I think it's triggered by certain medications, like anesthetics. But what about the inheritance pattern?

I've studied various inheritance patterns before. There's autosomal dominant, recessive, X-linked, Y-linked, mitochondrial, and others. Oh, wait, I think I remember that some muscle disorders have specific inheritance patterns. Like, myopathy or something similar.

Oh right! I think malignant hyperthermia is associated with a defect in the ryanodine receptor gene. And that gene is located on an autosome, so it's not sex-linked. Now, whether it's dominant or recessive. 

From what I recall, it's an autosomal dominant disorder. Because if I remember correctly, the condition can be triggered even by one defective gene. So if a person has one copy of the mutated gene, they can develop the condition when exposed to certain triggers.

Wait, but is it possible that it's recessive? No, because I think the presence of one copy is enough to predispose someone, especially under stress. So dominant makes sense.

Looking at the options, J is autosomal dominant. So the answer should be J.

The pattern of inheritance for malignant hyperthermia is autosomal dominant.
