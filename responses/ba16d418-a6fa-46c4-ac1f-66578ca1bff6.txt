Okay, I've got this ring theory question to tackle. Let me try to unpack it step by step. So, the question is about rings with exactly two right ideals and what that implies about the ring R. The options are I, II, III, and various combinations.

First, let me recall some definitions to make sure I'm on the right track. A ring R is a set equipped with two operations, addition and multiplication, where addition makes it an abelian group, and multiplication is associative with distributive laws holding. A ring has a multiplicative identity if there's an element 1 such that 1*r = r*1 = r for all r in R.

Now, a right ideal U of R is an additive subgroup of R such that for every u in U and every r in R, the product ur is in U. Similarly, a left ideal would involve ru, but the question is specifically about right ideals.

The question states that R has exactly two right ideals. I need to figure out what this means for R. Let's think about what right ideals a ring can have. In any ring, the entire ring R is a right ideal of itself because it's closed under addition and multiplication on the right by any element. Also, the trivial ideal, which is just the set containing the additive identity (0), is always a right ideal.

So, if R has exactly two right ideals, they must be {0} and R itself. That suggests that there are no other right ideals besides these two. Now, what rings have exactly two right ideals? I remember that simple rings have no nontrivial ideals, meaning their only ideals are {0} and R. So, R must be a simple ring.

Wait, but simple rings can be either Artinian or not. Also, I think that a division ring is a simple ring because its only ideals are trivial. So, if R is a division ring, then it has only two right ideals, {0} and R. That would satisfy the condition.

Now, looking at the options, statement II says R is a division ring, which aligns with what I just thought. But what about the other statements?

Statement I claims R is commutative. Hmm. Wait, division rings don't have to be commutative. A division ring is a ring where every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse, but multiplication isn't necessarily commutative. The classic example is the quaternions, which form a division ring but aren't commutative. So if R is a division ring, it doesn't have to be commutative. Therefore, statement I isn't necessarily true.

What about statement III, that R is infinite? Well, finite division rings are actually fields because of Wedderburn's little theorem, which says that finite division rings are commutative and hence fields. So if R is a finite ring with exactly two right ideals, it must be a field. But wait, no—Wedderburn's theorem applies to finite division rings. If R is finite and has exactly two right ideals, it's a division ring (so it must be a field because of Wedderburn), but that's a special case. However, the question doesn't specify that R is finite. So, R could be either finite or infinite. Wait, but if R is finite, it must be a field, which is a division ring. But the question is about any ring with exactly two right ideals, not necessarily finite. So statement III is saying R is infinite, but R could be finite (like a field with any number of elements). So statement III isn't necessarily true.

Wait, but if R has exactly two right ideals, {0} and R, then R must be a simple ring. And simple rings can be either finite (like fields) or infinite (like the ring of n x n matrices over a field, but wait, no—matrix rings have more right ideals. Hmm, wait, matrix rings over a field have more than two right ideals. So maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, let me think again. The ring of 2x2 matrices over a field has more than two right ideals. So that can't be a simple ring. Wait, no, matrix rings are simple Artinian rings. Wait, but their structure is more complicated. Oh wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. The ring of n x n matrices over a field is simple in the sense that it has no two-sided ideals except {0} and itself, but for one-sided ideals, they have many. So if R has exactly two right ideals, it can't be a matrix ring because matrix rings have more right ideals than just {0} and R.

So perhaps the only possibility for R to have exactly two right ideals is that R is a division ring. Because in a division ring, every non-zero element is a unit, and hence the only right ideals are trivial. So II must be true.

But wait, if R is a division ring, it's simple, but if R is finite, it's a field. So if R is finite, it's a field, which is commutative. So in the finite case, R would be commutative. But the question doesn't specify R is finite, so R could be an infinite division ring, like the quaternions, which is not commutative.

So, statement I (R is commutative) isn't necessarily true because R could be a non-commutative division ring. Statement II (R is a division ring) must be true because if R has exactly two right ideals, it's a division ring. Statement III (R is infinite) isn't necessarily true because R could be a finite field, which also has exactly two right ideals.

Wait, but let's think again. If R is a finite ring with exactly two right ideals, then R must be a division ring, and by Wedderburn's theorem, a finite division ring is a field, which is commutative. So in that case, R would be commutative. But the question doesn't say R is finite, so R could be either finite or infinite. So statement III says R is infinite, which is not necessarily true because R could be finite.

So, given that, which statements must be true? II must be true. I and III are not necessarily true.

Looking back at the options, option D is II only. So the answer should be D.

The question concerns a ring \( R \) with exactly two right ideals, \(\{0\}\) and \( R \) itself. Such a ring must be a simple ring, meaning it has no nontrivial ideals. A simple ring that is also a division ring (where every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse) satisfies this condition, as division rings have only trivial right ideals. 

Statement I claims \( R \) is commutative, but this is not necessarily true, as non-commutative division rings (e.g., the quaternions) exist. Statement II asserts \( R \) is a division ring, which must be true because a ring with only two right ideals is simple and thus a division ring. Statement III suggests \( R \) is infinite, but \( R \) could also be finite (e.g., a finite field), making this statement unnecessary.

Thus, only Statement II must hold.
