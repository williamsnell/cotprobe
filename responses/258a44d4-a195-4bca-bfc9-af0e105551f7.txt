Question:

Distinguish betweenpenetranceexpressivity.

Options:

A: Penetrance is the extent of gene expression, while expressivity is the percentage of individuals showing the trait
B: Expressivity is the percentage of individuals carrying a gene who express it phenotypically, while penetrance is the degree to which a gene expresses itself in different individuals.
C: Penetrance and expressivity are the same
D: Expressivity refers to the age at which a gene is expressed, while penetrance indicates the severity of the gene's phenotypic effect.
E: Penetrance is the overall impact of a gene on population health, while expressivity measures the gene's contribution to individual variation.
F: Penetrance is the likelihood of a gene being inherited, while expressivity is the variation in traits caused by genetic combinations.
G: Expressivity is affected by environmental conditions while penetrance is not
H: Penetrance is the percentage of individuals carrying a gene who express it phenotypically, while expressivity is the degree to which a gene expresses itself in different individuals.
I: Expressivity is the consistency of a gene's expression across different environments, while penetrance is the variability of that expression in a population.
J: Penetrance is the measure of environmental impact on gene expression, while expressivity is the genetic predisposition to a trait.

Okay, so I've got this question about penetrance and expressivity, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about these terms.

Penetrance refers to the percentage of individuals carrying a particular gene who actually show the trait associated with that gene. So if a gene has high penetrance, most people with that gene will display the trait. For example, if a disease gene has 70% penetrance, 70% of the carriers will develop the disease.

Expressivity, on the other hand, is about how the trait is expressed in individuals who do show it. It's about the variation in the severity or the extent of the trait's expression. So two people with the same gene might express it differentlyâ€”maybe one has a mild form and another has a severe form. That's expressivity.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A says penetrance is the extent of gene expression, and expressivity is the percentage of individuals showing the trait. Hmm, that's not quite right. Penetrance is about the percentage showing the trait, and expressivity is about how the trait is expressed in those who do show it. So A is mixing up the definitions.

Option B claims expressivity is the percentage of carriers expressing the trait, and penetrance is the degree of expression in different individuals. No, that's flipped. Penetrance is the percentage, and expressivity is the variation in expression.

Option C says they're the same. That's definitely wrong because the concepts are different, as I thought earlier.

Option D says expressivity refers to the age of expression, and penetrance is the severity. No, that's not right. Penetrance is about the percentage, not severity, and expressivity isn't about age.

Option E talks about population impact versus individual variation. I'm not sure, but penetrance is more about the percentage in a population showing the trait, while expressivity is about the variation in how the trait is expressed in individuals. So maybe E is mixing things up.

Option F says penetrance is the likelihood of inheritance, which is incorrect. Penetrance isn't about inheritance but about expressing the trait once inherited.

Option G suggests expressivity is affected by environment, but penetrance isn't. That doesn't sound right. Both can be influenced by environmental factors. For example, diet might affect how a gene for height is expressed, influencing both penetrance and expressivity.

Option H states penetrance is the percentage of carriers showing the trait, and expressivity is the degree of expression in different individuals. Yes, that's exactly correct based on what I remember. Penetrance is about the percentage, and expressivity is about the variation in expression.

Option I says expressivity is about consistency across environments, and penetrance is variability. That doesn't fit. Expressivity is about how the trait is expressed in those who have it, regardless of environment.

Option J claims penetrance is environmental impact, which is wrong. Penetrance is about the trait showing up, not the environment.

So the correct answer should be H.

The correct answer is H: Penetrance is the percentage of individuals carrying a gene who express it phenotypically, while expressivity is the degree to which a gene expresses itself in different individuals.

Answer: H
