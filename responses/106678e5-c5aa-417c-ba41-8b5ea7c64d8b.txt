Okay, so I've got this question about finding the impedance of a lossless medium. Hmm, let's see. I remember that impedance in such a medium is related to the intrinsic impedance of free space, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Wait, intrinsic impedance, right? Oh yeah, the formula involves the relative permittivity and permeability.

So the intrinsic impedance (η) of a medium is given by η = η₀ / sqrt(ε_r * μ_r), where η₀ is the intrinsic impedance of free space. I think η₀ is approximately 377 ohms. Oh right, that's the impedance of free space.

The problem gives me ε_r = 10 and μ_r = 5. So I need to plug those into the formula. Let me write that out. η = 377 / sqrt(10 * 5). Let me calculate the denominator first. 10 times 5 is 50, so sqrt(50). What's the square root of 50? Well, 7^2 is 49, so sqrt(50) is a bit more than 7, maybe around 7.07.

So now η = 377 / 7.07. Let me do that division. 377 divided by 7.07. Let's approximate. 7 times 50 is 350, so 50*7=350, and 7.07 is about 7, so 377 /7 is approximately 53.85. Wait, no, wait. Wait a second, 7.07 is a bit more than 7, so the result will be a bit less than 53.85. Hmm, maybe around 53. But wait, looking at the options, I don't see 53. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are A:132, B:377, C:150, D:300, E:266, F:500, G:212, H:350, I:600, J:75. Hmm, none of these are around 53. Did I make a mistake?

Wait a second, maybe I mixed up the formula. Oh! Wait, no, the formula is correct. Oh wait, no, wait another thing: intrinsic impedance is η = η₀ / sqrt(ε_r * μ_r). But wait, what if I got the formula wrong? No, no, I think that's right because the intrinsic impedance depends inversely on the square root of the product of permittivity and permeability.

Wait, maybe I made a calculation error. Let me recalculate. sqrt(10 *5)=sqrt(50)=5*sqrt(2). Because sqrt(50)=sqrt(25*2)=5√2. So sqrt(50)=5*1.414≈7.07.

So η =377 / (5*1.414) = 377/(7.07)=approx 53.3 ohms. But that's not among the options. Wait, maybe I got the formula backwards. Oh no, wait, no, because a medium with higher ε and μ would have lower impedance. Since free space is 377, and this medium has ε_r=10 and μ_r=5, which are both higher than 1, so the impedance should be lower than 377. But none of the options except J is lower than that, but J is 75, which is way lower than 53. So something's wrong.

Wait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me think again. Oh! Wait a second. Intrinsic impedance is η = η₀ * sqrt( (μ_r)/(ε_r) ). Wait, is that correct? Because sometimes I get confused between the formulas for velocity and impedance.

Wait, the intrinsic impedance η is given by η = η₀ * sqrt( μ_r / ε_r ). Oh, wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Because η is η₀ multiplied by sqrt(μ_r/ε_r). Oh! I think I inverted it before. So the correct formula is η = η₀ * sqrt(μ_r / ε_r).

Wait, okay, let's double-check. The intrinsic impedance η is equal to the intrinsic impedance of free space η₀ multiplied by the square root of (relative permeability divided by relative permittivity). So η = η₀ * sqrt(μ_r/ε_r).

So with η₀ = 377 ohms, μ_r=5, ε_r=10. So sqrt(5/10)=sqrt(0.5)= approx 0.7071.

So η = 377 * 0.7071 ≈ 377 * 0.707 ≈ let's calculate that.

377 * 0.7 is 263.9. 377 * 0.007 is about 2.639. So total approx 263.9 + 2.64 ≈ 266.54 ohms.

Looking at the options, E is 266 ohms. So that's the answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought the formula was division, but that must have been a mistake. So I should have multiplied by sqrt(μ_r/ε_r). So the correct approach gives me approximately 266 ohms, which is option E.

The intrinsic impedance of a lossless medium is calculated using the formula:

\[
\eta = \eta_0 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\mu_r}{\epsilon_r}}
\]

where:
- \(\eta_0\) is the intrinsic impedance of free space (\(377 \, \Omega\)),
- \(\mu_r = 5\),
- \(\epsilon_r = 10\).

Substituting the values:

\[
\eta = 377 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{5}{10}} = 377 \cdot \sqrt{0.5} \approx 377 \cdot 0.707 \approx 266 \, \Omega
\]

Thus, the impedance of the medium is approximately \(266 \, \Omega\), which corresponds to option E.
