Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about breastfeeding and its major research-supported result. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, the question is asking what research suggests is the major result of breastfeeding an infant. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

I remember that breastfeeding is often discussed in terms of both health benefits for the baby and the mother. From what I've heard, breastfeeding can contribute to stronger immunity because breast milk contains antibodies. That makes me think about option A, which says "stronger infant immunity solely based on the duration of breastfeeding." But wait, the word "solely" might be a problem here. I think the duration is important, but there are other factors too, like the mother's diet and health. So maybe A isn't the best choice because it's too absolute.

Option B is about the specific method used in feeding. I'm not sure what that refers to. Maybe it's about how the baby is positioned or the technique. I don't recall that being the major result, so I'll probably rule this out.

Option C talks about the parents' attitude during feeding. That seems more about the emotional aspect rather than a major physical or developmental result. I don't think this is the main point research highlights, so I'll skip this one.

Option D says predictable sleep patterns established immediately. I don't think breastfeeding alone establishes predictable sleep right away. Infants have their own sleep patterns, and it's not just about feeding. So D might not be correct.

Option E mentions enhanced cognitive development exclusively due to nutrients. While breast milk does have nutrients that support brain development, the word "exclusively" might be incorrect because other factors like stimulation and environment also play a role. So E might not be the best answer.

Option F is about oral stimulation and eating. Breastfeeding does involve oral stimulation, but I'm not sure if that's considered the major result. It's more of a method than an outcome.

Option G suggests that long-term taste preferences are determined by breast milk flavors. I've heard that breast milk can vary in flavor based on the mother's diet, which might influence the baby's preferences later. But is this the major result? I'm not certain.

Option H says a more diverse palate by age one. That seems related to taste preferences, but again, I'm not sure if this is the primary result highlighted by research. It might be a factor but not the main one.

Option I is about intimate contact with the mother. This makes sense because breastfeeding involves close physical contact, which can have emotional and bonding benefits. I've read that skin-to-skin contact is important for bonding and can have various positive effects on the baby's development.

Option J claims increased physical growth rate compared to formula-fed infants. I think in the short term, breastfed babies might have different growth patterns, but I'm not sure if it's a long-term significant difference. Some studies suggest that breastfed infants grow differently, but I'm not certain if that's the major result.

So, thinking again, the major result is probably more about the relationship and contact rather than just physical growth or immunity. The research often emphasizes the benefits of mother-infant bonding and the health advantages, including immune support. But I'm a bit torn between A and I.

Wait, the question is about the major result. Enhanced cognitive development is a big point, but E says "exclusively" due to nutrients, which isn't correct. So E is out. The strongest options seem to be A and I.

But the key here is that the major result is not just about immunity. While that's important, some sources say that the primary benefit highlighted by research is the immune support because breast milk provides antibodies. However, other sources emphasize the bonding and contact as crucial.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should think about what is considered the most significant outcome. Some studies point to the long-term health benefits, like lower risk of certain diseases, which ties back to immunity. But others highlight the emotional and developmental aspects from the contact.

Wait, let me think about the wording of the options. Option A says "solely based on the duration," which might be too narrow. Research shows that the longer you breastfeed, the more benefits, but it's not the only factor. So maybe A isn't the best choice.

Option I, "intimate contact with the mother," seems more about the process and the relationship, which is a major result beyond just health benefits. It's not just about the immune system but also about the emotional and physical connection.

I think the correct answer is I because the question is about the major result, and while health benefits are important, the intimate contact is a fundamental aspect that contributes to various positive outcomes, including health, but is itself a significant result.

The major result of breastfeeding an infant, as suggested by research, is the intimate contact with the mother. This close physical and emotional connection is fundamental and contributes to various positive outcomes, including health benefits and emotional bonding. While other options like stronger immunity or cognitive development are important, the intimate contact itself is highlighted as a significant result.

Answer: I
