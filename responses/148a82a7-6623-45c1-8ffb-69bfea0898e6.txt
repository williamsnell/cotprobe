Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"The question as to who, and what, is responsible for African underdevelopment can be answered at two levels. Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa."
Walter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974
Rodney's argument in the passage is most likely a response to which of the following developments of the period 1450 to 1750 C.E.?

Options:

A: The colonization of the interior of Africa by European powers
B: The expansion of the African diaspora to the New World
C: The spread of Christianity into Sub-Saharan Africa
D: The importation of New World products into Africa

Answer:

Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about Walter Rodney's argument in his book "How Europe Underdeveloped Africa," and we need to connect it to a historical development between 1450 and 1750 C.E.

First, I remember that Walter Rodney was a historian who focused on how European actions contributed to Africa's underdevelopment. His argument, as given in the passage, talks about the imperialist system draining African wealth and preventing faster development. He mentions that Western European capitalists extended their exploitation across Africa.

The question is asking which development from 1450 to 1750 this argument is a response to. So I'm thinking about the major events in Africa during that time.

Looking at the options:

A: Colonization of the interior of Africa by Europeans. That started more in the 19th century with the Scramble for Africa, so probably not.

B: Expansion of the African diaspora to the New World. That's related to the transatlantic slave trade, which was significant from the 16th to 19th centuries. But how does that tie into underdevelopment?

C: Spread of Christianity into Sub-Saharan Africa. Missionaries did come in later periods, maybe 19th and 20th centuries, so not sure about 1450-1750.

D: Importation of New World products into Africa. This could relate to the exchange during the Age of Exploration and the triangular trade, where European traders brought goods from the Americas to Africa, often in exchange for enslaved people and raw materials.

Rodney's argument is about European exploitation and the drain of African wealth. The period 1450-1750 includes the height of the transatlantic slave trade and the beginning of more intensive European contact. Europeans were extracting resources and using Africa as a source of wealth, which fits with the idea of underdevelopment.

Option D involves the importation of New World products, but I'm not sure that's the main point. Wait, maybe the better fit is the broader economic exploitation, which could include the slave trade and resource extraction. But the options don't mention the slave trade directly.

Wait, in the passage, Rodney talks about the imperialist system and draining African wealth. So perhaps the development he's responding to is the expansion of European economic control and exploitation, which would have started with the early voyages and the establishment of trade networks. The importation of New World products might be a part of that, but more likely, the main issue is the economic exploitation facilitated through the transatlantic trade.

Alternatively, maybe the option that best fits is A: colonization of the interior. But as I thought earlier, that's more late 19th century. So perhaps D is the right answer because it's about the exchange between Europe, Africa, and the New World, which would have started during the period in question.

Wait, but in the passage, Rodney is talking about how European capitalism expanded exploitation into Africa, which would align with the period when European powers were establishing trade relations and extracting resources. So maybe the answer is D because the importation of New World products was part of the broader economic system that Rodney is critiquing. But I'm not entirely sure. Another possibility is that the argument is in response to the transatlantic slave trade, which was a major factor in draining Africa's wealth and labor.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The key points in Rodney's argument are imperialism, draining wealth, and European exploitation. The period 1450-1750 includes the rise of the slave trade and the beginning of European economic dominance. So the development that Rodney is responding to would be the economic exploitation and the system that allowed Europeans to take African resources.

Looking at the options, option A is about colonization, which is more about political control, whereas Rodney's argument is more about economic exploitation. So perhaps the correct answer is D: the importation of New World products, as part of the broader trade system that exploited Africa.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Another angle: the argument is about how Europe underdeveloped Africa through their system. So the immediate response would be to the expansion of European economic control and the extraction of wealth, which would tie into the trade with the New World. So the importation of New World products into Africa might be part of the exchange system where Europe took African resources and gave back goods from the Americas.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is B, the expansion of the African diaspora, because that's about the forced migration and how it depleted Africa's population and workforce, contributing to underdevelopment. That makes sense because the transatlantic slave trade was a huge part of the underdevelopment narrative.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to outline:

Rodney's argument: European imperialism and capitalism drained Africa's wealth, preventing development.

Which of the options (A-D) is a development that would prompt this argument?

Option B: Expansion of African diaspora (slave trade). That's a direct cause of economic and social disruption in Africa, leading to underdevelopment.

Option D: Importation of New World products. That's part of the trade, but maybe not the main issue Rodney is addressing.

So perhaps the correct answer is B. Because the massive loss of population due to the diaspora (slavery) would have hindered Africa's development, and Rodney might be addressing that as part of the broader imperialist system.

Wait, but the passage also mentions "draining African wealth" and "resources" beyond just people. So maybe it's more about the extraction of raw materials and the economic system, which would tie into trade with the New World.

I'm still not sure. Let me think about when these developments occurred. The expansion of the African diaspora happened mainly from the 16th to 18th centuries, which fits the 1450-1750 timeframe. Importation of New World products would have started with Columbus and the early explorers, so that also fits.

Rodney's argument is about how Europe's actions led to African underdevelopment. So the events that directly relate are the economic exploitation, which includes the slave trade and resource extraction. Therefore, both options B and D are related.

But the question is which development Rodney is responding to. The passage doesn't directly mention the diaspora but talks about economic retardation and resource exploitation. So perhaps the better fit is D, as it's about the economic exchange that allowed Europe to drain Africa's resources.

Wait, but the passage says "draining African wealth" and "making it impossible to develop more rapidly," which sounds more like the economic exploitation (taking wealth) and the manipulation of the system. So the importation of New World products would be part of that system.

Alternatively, the answer might be A, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm going to go with D: The importation of New World products into Africa. Because that ties into the economic system that Rodney is criticizing, where Europe used Africa for resources and in exchange brought in products from the Americas, which disrupted local economies and contributed to underdevelopment.

The question asks which historical development between 1450 and 1750 C.E. Walter Rodney's argument about European imperialism and capitalism's role in African underdevelopment is most likely responding to. Rodney's argument focuses on the draining of African wealth, resource exploitation, and the economic system that hindered Africa's development.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Colonization of the interior of Africa by European powers**  
  This occurred primarily in the 19th century during the Scramble for Africa, which is outside the timeframe of 1450â€“1750. Thus, it is unlikely to be the correct answer.

- **B: The expansion of the African diaspora to the New World**  
  This refers to the transatlantic slave trade, which was significant during the 16th to 18th centuries. While it caused massive population loss and economic disruption in Africa, Rodney's argument emphasizes economic exploitation and resource extraction, not just the diaspora.

- **C: The spread of Christianity into Sub-Saharan Africa**  
  While Christianity spread during this period, it is not directly related to the economic exploitation or underdevelopment Rodney addresses.

- **D: The importation of New World products into Africa**  
  This ties into the broader economic system of trade between Europe, Africa, and the Americas. European traders exchanged African resources (e.g., enslaved people, raw materials) for New World goods, contributing to the drain of African wealth and economic underdevelopment. This aligns closely with Rodney's critique of the imperialist system.

Given Rodney's focus on economic exploitation and the imperialist system, the importation of New World products into Africa (Option D) best fits the development he is responding to. It represents the economic exchange that facilitated the draining of African wealth and hindered development.

Answer: D
