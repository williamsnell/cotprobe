Question:

The charge on an oil drop is measured in the laboratory. Which of the following measurements should be rejected as highly unlikely to be correct?

Options:

A: 2.4 × 10^-19 C
B: 6.4 × 10^-19 C
C: 8.0 × 10^-19 C
D: 4.8 × 10^-19 C

Okay, so I've got this question about measuring the charge on an oil drop in a lab. The options are different values, and I need to figure out which one is highly unlikely. Hmm, I remember something about oil drop experiments and charges being multiples of a certain value.

Wait, right! The oil drop experiment by Robert Millikan showed that the charge of oil drops is quantized, meaning it's a multiple of the elementary charge, which is approximately 1.6 × 10^-19 coulombs. So each drop should have a charge that's like 1e, 2e, 3e, and so on.

Let me look at the options:

A: 2.4 × 10^-19 C. That's close to 2.4 divided by 1.6 gives 1.5e. But wait, 1.5 isn't an integer. So that would mean 1.5 times the elementary charge, which shouldn't happen because charges are in whole number multiples. So this might be the unlikely one.

B: 6.4 × 10^-19 C. Dividing by 1.6 gives 4. So that's 4e, which is fine.

C: 8.0 × 10^-19 C. Divided by 1.6 is 5. So 5e, that's acceptable.

D: 4.8 × 10^-19 C. Divided by 1.6 is 3. So 3e, which is also fine.

So the only one that doesn't fit is A, because 2.4 isn't a multiple of 1.6 in terms of integers. Unless maybe if there's some error in calculation, but in a lab setting, such a precise measurement would likely show a multiple. So I think A is the one to reject.

The charge on an oil drop is quantized and should be an integer multiple of the elementary charge, approximately 1.6 × 10^-19 C. Evaluating the options:

- A: 2.4 × 10^-19 C is 1.5 times the elementary charge, not an integer multiple.
- B: 6.4 × 10^-19 C is 4 times the elementary charge.
- C: 8.0 × 10^-19 C is 5 times the elementary charge.
- D: 4.8 × 10^-19 C is 3 times the elementary charge.

Only A is not an integer multiple, making it highly unlikely.

Answer: A
