Question:

A student decides that, having already spent three hours studying for an exam, she should spend one more hour studying for the same exam. Which of the following is most likely true?

Options:

A: The marginal benefit of the third hour was likely greater than the marginal benefit of the fourth hour.
B: The marginal cost of the third hour was likely greater than the marginal cost of the fourth hour.
C: The marginal benefit of the fourth hour is at least as great as the marginal cost of the fourth hour.
D: The marginal benefit of the fourth hour is certainly less than the marginal cost of the fourth hour.
E: The marginal cost of the fourth hour is at least as great as the marginal benefit of the fourth hour.
F: The marginal cost of the fourth hour is likely less than the marginal cost of the third hour.
G: The marginal benefit of the fourth hour is certainly more than the marginal cost of the fourth hour.
H: Without knowing the studentâ€™s opportunity cost of studying, we have no way of knowing whether or not her marginal benefits outweigh her marginal costs.
I: Without knowing the student's other commitments, we cannot determine the marginal cost or benefit of the fourth hour.

Okay, so I have this economics question about a student studying for an exam. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question says that a student has already spent three hours studying and decides to spend one more hour, making it four hours in total. The question is asking which statement is most likely true about the marginal benefits and costs of that fourth hour.

First, I need to recall what marginal benefit and marginal cost mean. Marginal benefit is the additional benefit gained from studying an extra hour, and marginal cost is the additional cost of that extra hour. In economics, the optimal decision is usually where marginal benefit equals marginal cost. But here, the student is deciding to study for a fourth hour after already having studied three.

I think this relates to the concept of diminishing returns. Typically, as you spend more time studying, the additional benefit you get from each extra hour decreases. So the first hour might give a lot of benefit, the second less, the third even less, and the fourth probably the least. That would mean that the marginal benefit of the fourth hour is less than the marginal benefit of the third hour. So looking at the options, option A says the marginal benefit of the third hour was greater than the fourth. That makes sense because of diminishing returns.

Now, looking at the options, option C says that the marginal benefit of the fourth hour is at least as great as its marginal cost. But wait, if the marginal benefit is less than the third hour's, and assuming the marginal cost is increasing (maybe because she's getting tired, so the cost in terms of time or effort is higher), then perhaps the marginal cost might have increased. But I'm not sure about that.

Option D says the marginal benefit is certainly less than the marginal cost. But "certainly" seems too strong. It's possible that the marginal benefit is still higher than the marginal cost, which would mean she should study more. But since she only studied one more hour, maybe the marginal benefit was just equal to the marginal cost at that point.

Option E says the marginal cost of the fourth hour is at least as great as the marginal benefit. That sounds like it's suggesting MB < MC. If that's the case, she shouldn't study the fourth hour. But in the question, she does decide to study the fourth hour, so that might imply that MB >= MC for that hour.

Wait, but the question says she has already spent three hours and decides to spend one more. So she's making the choice after three hours. The question is about the fourth hour. So perhaps, after three hours, the marginal benefit of the fourth hour is still positive but maybe less than the marginal cost, but she still chooses to study. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because if MB < MC, she should stop.

Alternatively, maybe she is optimizing, meaning at the point where MB = MC, she stops. So if she studies the fourth hour, it's because the MB of the fourth hour is equal to its MC. But in the options, none say exactly that. Option C says MB is at least as great as MC, which would mean she should study. Option E says MC is at least as great as MB, meaning she shouldn't.

But the fact that she decided to study the fourth hour suggests that MB >= MC for that hour. So option C might be correct. But wait, the question is about what is "most likely" true. Let me think again.

In the case of studying, the marginal cost might be the time spent away from other activities, which is an opportunity cost. So each additional hour's opportunity cost increases because she could have done something else. But the marginal benefit of studying might decrease because each additional hour provides less additional knowledge.

So for the third hour, the marginal benefit is higher than the fourth. So option A is saying that, which is likely true due to diminishing returns.

But the question is about the fourth hour in relation to costs and benefits. So the decision to study the fourth hour implies that the marginal benefit of that hour is at least as much as the marginal cost. Otherwise, she wouldn't choose to study.

So looking at the options, option C says the marginal benefit of the fourth hour is at least as great as the marginal cost. That would mean she should study, which she did. So option C is likely correct.

Wait, but option H says without knowing the opportunity cost, we can't know if MB > MC. But the question is about what is most likely true, not what we can conclude definitively. Since the student decided to study, it suggests that for her, MB >= MC for the fourth hour. So option C is the most likely.

Alternatively, option E says MC >= MB, which would mean she shouldn't study, but she did, so that's less likely.

So putting it together, the correct answer is option A about the marginal benefit of the third hour being greater than the fourth, which is due to diminishing returns, and the decision to study the fourth hour suggests that MB >= MC, making option C correct.

The question involves analyzing the marginal benefit (MB) and marginal cost (MC) of a student studying for a fourth hour after already studying for three hours. Marginal benefit refers to the additional benefit gained from studying an extra hour, while marginal cost refers to the additional cost, such as time or effort, incurred by studying that hour.

The concept of diminishing returns applies here, meaning that as the student studies longer, the additional benefit from each extra hour decreases. Therefore, the marginal benefit of the third hour is likely greater than the marginal benefit of the fourth hour, making option A correct.

The student's decision to study for the fourth hour suggests that the marginal benefit of that hour is at least as great as its marginal cost. If the marginal benefit were less than the marginal cost, the student would not choose to study further. Thus, option C, which states that the marginal benefit of the fourth hour is at least as great as its marginal cost, is also correct.

However, the question asks for the most likely true statement. While option A is true due to diminishing returns, option C directly explains the student's decision to study the fourth hour. Therefore, the best answer is:

C
