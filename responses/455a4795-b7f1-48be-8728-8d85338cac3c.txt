Okay, so I need to figure out the final stock price of company XYZ after five days. Let me start by writing down the initial price, which is $24.75. Then I'll go through each day's change and add or subtract accordingly. 

On Monday, the stock gained $2.50. So I'll add 2.50 to 24.75. Let me do that: 24.75 + 2.50 equals 27.25. That's the price at the end of Monday.

Next, Tuesday's change was a loss of $3.25. So I subtract 3.25 from the previous day's end, which was 27.25. Let's see, 27.25 minus 3.25 is 24.00. That's the price after Tuesday.

Then on Wednesday, the stock lost another $0.75. Subtracting that from 24.00 gives me 23.25. So after Wednesday, the price is $23.25.

On Thursday, there was a gain of $1.25. Adding that to 23.25 brings it to 24.50. So Thursday's end price is 24.50.

Finally, on Friday, the stock gained $4.75. Adding that to 24.50, I get 24.50 + 4.75. Let me calculate that: 24 + 4 is 28, and 0.50 + 0.75 is 1.25. So 28 + 1.25 is 29.25. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, 24.50 plus 4.75 is actually 29.25, because 24.50 + 4 is 28.50, plus 0.75 makes 29.25. Yeah, that's correct.

So the final price after Friday is $29.25. Now looking at the options, option C is 29.25, so the answer must be C.
