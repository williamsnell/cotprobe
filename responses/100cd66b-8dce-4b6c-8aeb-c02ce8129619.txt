Okay, so I need to figure out how much angular momentum Hurricane Florence had when it hit land. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about the exact value, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that angular momentum (L) is calculated using the formula L = I * ω, where I is the moment of inertia and ω is the angular velocity. But wait, I'm not exactly sure how to apply this to a hurricane. Maybe I can think about the scale of a hurricane.

Hurricanes are massive storms with strong winds and a large area. They rotate, so they have angular momentum. The key here is the size and wind speed because those factors contribute to the moment of inertia and angular velocity, respectively.

I think the moment of inertia for a rotating cylinder or disk might be useful here. For a solid cylinder, I = (1/2) m r². But a hurricane isn't a perfect cylinder, but maybe approximating it as such could work. Alternatively, considering it as a collection of particles moving in circular paths.

Assuming an average radius for Hurricane Florence. I remember that hurricanes can vary, but I think Florence was a large storm. Let me check, when it hit land, it was probably around 100-200 km in radius. Let's say 100 km, which is 1e5 meters.

Next, the wind speed. I think the maximum winds in a hurricane can reach up to about 100 m/s or more. Wait, but when it hits land, does the wind speed decrease? Maybe, but perhaps the question is considering the speed as it was when it made landfall. Let's say the average wind speed near the center was roughly 50 m/s. I'm not entirely certain, but that's a ballpark figure.

So, the angular velocity ω is 2π times the wind speed divided by the radius. Wait, no, actually, the tangential velocity v = ω * r, so ω = v / r. If v is 50 m/s and r is 1e5 meters, then ω = 50 / 1e5 = 5e-4 radians per second.

Now, the moment of inertia I for the entire mass of the hurricane. That's tricky. How much does a hurricane weigh? I'm not sure. Maybe I can estimate the mass. Let's think about the area and the density of the storm. The area of a circle is πr², so π*(1e5)^2 = about 3e10 m². If I assume a very rough density, say 1 kg per cubic meter (which is about the density of water), but a hurricane isn't just water—it's a lot of air and moisture, but maybe that's a starting point.

Wait, but the actual mass of a hurricane is probably much less because the atmosphere is less dense. Let me think. The mass of air in a column of the storm. The pressure gradient in a hurricane can give it a lot of energy, but I'm not sure about the mass. Alternatively, I've heard that the mass of a hurricane can be on the order of 1e16 kg. Let me go with that as a rough estimate.

So I = (1/2) m r² = 0.5 * 1e16 kg * (1e5 m)^2. Let's calculate that: (1e5)^2 is 1e10, multiplied by 1e16 gives 1e26, multiplied by 0.5 gives 5e25 kg·m².

Then, angular momentum L = I * ω = 5e25 * 5e-4. Let's compute that: 5e25 * 5e-4 = 25e21 = 2.5e22 kg·m²/s.

Looking at the options, option F is L = 1e22 kg·m²/s, which is close to my estimate of 2.5e22. So the closest answer would be F.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the mass I used is correct. If the mass were smaller, say 1e15 kg, then I would be 0.5 * 1e15 * 1e10 = 5e24, and L would be 5e24 *5e-4 = 2.5e21, which would be around 1e21, matching option H. But I think the mass of a hurricane is indeed larger. Another source I recall says the mass is about 1e16 kg, so my initial calculation of 2.5e22 would point to option F (1e22). Alternatively, maybe it's an order of magnitude, so 1e22 is the correct choice.

To estimate the angular momentum of Hurricane Florence when it hit land, we use the formula \( L = I \cdot \omega \), where \( I \) is the moment of inertia and \( \omega \) is the angular velocity. Assuming the hurricane as a rough cylinder with radius \( r = 1 \times 10^5 \, \text{m} \) and wind speed \( v = 50 \, \text{m/s} \), the angular velocity \( \omega = v / r = 5 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{rad/s} \). Estimating the mass of the hurricane as \( m = 1 \times 10^{16} \, \text{kg} \), the moment of inertia \( I = \frac{1}{2} m r^2 = 5 \times 10^{25} \, \text{kg·m}^2 \). Thus, \( L = I \cdot \omega = 2.5 \times 10^{22} \, \text{kg·m}^2/\text{s} \), which aligns closely with option F (\( 10^{22} \, \text{kg·m}^2/\text{s} \)).
