Question:

This question refers to the following information.
But the decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.

Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is about which other classical empires besides Rome could have their fall explained by the reasons Gibbon gave. From the passage, Gibbon talks about the decline being due to immoderate greatness, prosperity leading to decay, the causes of destruction increasing with conquest, and the empire becoming too heavy to support itself. He also mentions the military becoming corrupted, leading to the collapse under barbarians.

So, I need to think about other empires and their declines. Let's look at the options:

Option A: Ming and Aztec. Ming China did decline, possibly due to internal decay, and the Aztecs fell to the Spanish, but I'm not sure if it's the same as Gibbon's reasons.

Option B: Egyptian and Hittite. The Egyptian empire did decline, but I'm not sure if it was due to the same factors. The Hittite empire fell around 1200 BCE, possibly due to invasions, not exactly matching Gibbon's points.

Option C: Han and Gupta. Both were large empires that declined. The Han fell due to internal strife and invasions, and the Gupta also faced similar issues, maybe aligning with Gibbon's ideas.

Option D: Macedonian and Seleucid. The Macedonian Empire under Alexander's successors broke down into Hellenistic kingdoms, but I'm not sure if it fits Gibbon's reasons about corruption and military decay.

Option E: Mughal and Assyrian. The Mughal Empire declined due to internal factors and invasions, but the Assyrians fell around 600 BCE, which is earlier and perhaps not matching.

Option F: Maurya and Babylonian. The Maurya Empire in India declined after Ashoka, possibly due to internal issues, and the Babylonian Empire fell to the Persians, but again, not sure if it's the same as Gibbon's points.

Option G: Tang and Ottoman. The Tang Dynasty declined due to internal problems and invasions, and the Ottoman Empire's decline involved corruption and external pressures. This could fit, but I'm not certain.

Option H: Qin and Etruscan. Qin was short-lived, and the Etruscan civilization was absorbed by Rome, not sure about the reasons.

Option I: Byzantine and Persian. The Byzantine Empire fell to the Ottomans, and the Persian Empire (Achaemenid) fell to Alexander. The Byzantine decline involved internal and external pressures, but the Persian Empire's fall was more about military conquest.

Option J: Abbasid and Inca. The Abbasid Caliphate declined due to internal strife and external attacks, and the Inca Empire fell to the Spanish. This might fit, especially the Abbasid part.

Now, Gibbon's reasons include internal decay, corruption, military decline, and being overwhelmed by barbarians. The Byzantine Empire fits because it faced similar issues, declining due to internal problems and eventually falling to the Ottomans. The Persian Empire (specifically the Achaemenid) might not fit as well since their decline was more about direct military defeat by Alexander, not the same as a gradual decay.

Wait, but the passage also mentions the military becoming a burden, like mercenaries. The Byzantines did have issues with their military becoming a burden, and eventually, they couldn't hold back the barbarians, like the Ottomans. So the Byzantine Empire could be a good fit. The other part is the Persian Empire, but I'm not sure if their decline was due to the same factors.

Looking back at the options, option I is Byzantine and Persian. Alternatively, maybe the Abbasid Caliphate fits better because their decline was more about internal decay and being overwhelmed by external forces, like the Mongols and others. So option J includes Abbasid and Inca. The Inca did fall to the Spanish, but was that due to internal decay? The Inca collapse was more due to external factors (Spanish conquest) rather than internal decay, so maybe not.

Wait, the passage also talks about the military becoming a burden. The Byzantine Empire had a strong military but eventually couldn't sustain it, leading to their fall. The Persian Empire under the Achaemenids fell to Alexander, but perhaps their decline involved internal issues as well. Alternatively, the Abbasid Caliphate's decline involved internal strife and external attacks, which aligns with Gibbon's points.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The question is which empires' fall could be explained by the same reasons as Gibbon gave for Rome. So prosperity leading to decay, causes multiplying with conquest, and the empire collapsing under its own weight, plus military corruption leading to being overwhelmed by barbarians.

The Byzantine Empire fits because they had internal decay, corruption, and eventually fell to external forces (Ottomans). The Persian Empire (Achaemenid) fell to Alexander, but perhaps their decline was due to overextension and internal issues. So option I (Byzantine and Persian) might be correct.

Alternatively, looking at option J: Abbasid and Inca. The Abbasid decline involved internal decay and external pressures, so that fits. The Inca, though, I'm not sure if their fall was due to internal decay or more external factors.

Wait, the passage also mentions that prosperity ripened the principle of decay. So perhaps the Byzantine Empire's prosperity led to internal issues. The Persian Empire's decline also involved internal problems and external invasions. So I think option I is correct.
</think>

The passage describes the decline of the Roman Empire due to immoderate greatness, internal decay, military corruption, and being overwhelmed by external forces. Applying these reasons to other empires, the Byzantine Empire fits because it experienced internal decay, corruption, and eventual collapse under external pressures from the Ottomans. The Persian Empire (Achaemenid) also aligns, as its decline involved overextension and internal issues leading to external defeat by Alexander. Therefore, the best answer is:

I

Answer: I
