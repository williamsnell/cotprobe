Okay, so I have this question about the speed of an electromagnetic wave in empty space. Hmm, I remember from my physics classes that electromagnetic waves travel at a certain speed, and I think it's a constant value. But wait, what exactly is that speed?

I recall that in a vacuum, which is empty space, electromagnetic waves, including light, travel at a specific speed. I think the number is something like 3 times 10 to the eighth meters per second. Let me think, is it exactly 3.00 × 10^8 m/s? Or maybe it's a bit more precise, like 2.998 × 10^8, but often rounded to 3.00 × 10^8.

Looking at the options, option A is 3.00 × 10^8 m/sec. Option F is 3.25 × 10^8, which seems a bit high. Option E is 3.5, which is even higher. Those don't sound right. The other options are lower than 3, so they can't be correct because I remember the speed is about 300 million meters per second.

Wait, what about the exact value? I think the exact speed is approximately 299,792,458 m/s, but in most cases, it's approximated as 3.00 × 10^8 m/s for simplicity. So in the options given, option A matches this value exactly.

I don't think any other option makes sense. For example, option B is 1.5 × 10^8, which is half of the speed I'm thinking of. Option C is 5 × 10^8, which is way too fast. So yeah, option A must be the correct answer.

The speed of an electromagnetic wave in empty space is a well-known constant, approximately \(3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\). Among the given options, only option A matches this value.

Answer: A
