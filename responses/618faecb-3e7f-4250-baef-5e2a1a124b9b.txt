Question:

Order the following (risk, return) pairs from least to most favourable, assuming the perspective of a rational and risk-averse investor: (2,2),(2,3) and (4,2). Risk is measured in standard deviations and return in percentage. HINT: Imagine a scatter diagram with standard deviation on the x-axis and return on the y-axis.

Options:

A: (2,3),(2,2),(4,2)
B: (4,2),(2,2),(4,2)
C: (2,2),(2,2),(4,2)
D: (2,2),(2,3),(4,2)
E: (2,2),(4,2),(2,3)
F: (4,2),(2,3),(2,2)
G: (4,2),(2,2),(2,3)
H: (2,3),(4,2),(2,2)
I: (2,2),(4,2),(2,2)

Okay, so I've got this question about ordering (risk, return) pairs for a rational, risk-averse investor. The pairs given are (2,2), (2,3), and (4,2). I need to figure out the order from least to most favourable. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that a risk-averse investor prefers investments that offer higher returns with lower risks. So, they look for the highest return for the least risk. The hint mentions a scatter diagram with standard deviation on the x-axis and return on the y-axis. So, plotting these points, the least risky and highest return would be the most favorable, and the higher risk with lower return would be the least favorable.

Let me list out the pairs:
1. (2,2) → risk 2, return 2%
2. (2,3) → risk 2, return 3%
3. (4,2) → risk 4, return 2%

Since the investor is risk-averse, they would prefer lower risk first. So between the first two, both have the same risk (2), but (2,3) has a higher return. So (2,3) is better than (2,2). Now, the third pair has higher risk (4) but same return as (2,2). So (4,2) is less favorable than both because it has higher risk for the same return.

So the order from least to most favorable would be: (4,2) is the least favorable because it's higher risk with lower return than others. Then (2,2) is next, and the most favorable is (2,3).

Wait, but the question asks for the order from least to most favourable. So from least (worst) to most (best). So the order would be (4,2) comes first, then (2,2), then (2,3).

Looking at the options, let's see which one follows this order.

Option A: (2,3), (2,2), (4,2) → No, that's best to worst.
Option D: (2,2), (2,3), (4,2) → No, that's best to worst.
Option E: (2,2), (4,2), (2,3) → No, because (4,2) is in the middle.
Option F: (4,2), (2,3), (2,2) → That's (4,2) first, then (2,3) which is better, but then (2,2) after? That doesn't make sense.
Option G: (4,2), (2,2), (2,3) → Yes, this is the order I thought: least (4,2), then (2,2), then (2,3) as most favorable.
Wait, no, option G is (4,2), (2,2), (2,3). So the order is from least to most, which is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check. The order should be least favorable to most favorable. So the first in the list should be the worst, then the next, then the best.

So (4,2) is the worst, then (2,2), then (2,3) is the best. So the correct order is (4,2), (2,2), (2,3).

Looking at the options, option G is (4,2), (2,2), (2,3). So the answer should be option G.

The correct order from least to most favourable is (4,2), (2,2), (2,3). 

Answer: G
