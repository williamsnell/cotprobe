Question:

The ability of the brain to detect differences in stimulus intensity is best explained by the fact that which of the following varies with the stimulus intensity?

Options:

A: The number of synapses crossed
B: The speed of the action potential
C: The amplitude of the action potential
D: The number of neurons activated
E: The refractory period of the neuron
F: The number of action potentials per second
G: The duration of the action potential
H: The permeability of the neuron's membrane
I: The resting potential of the neuron
J: The threshold potential

Answer:

Okay, so I have this question about the brain's ability to detect differences in stimulus intensity. The question is asking which factor varies with the stimulus intensity. Let's see, I need to pick from options A to J.

First, I remember that when a stimulus is applied to a neuron, it affects the cell in some way. If the stimulus is strong enough, it causes the neuron to fire an action potential. But how does the brain detect varying intensities?

Hmm, I think about what happens when the stimulus is weak versus strong. A stronger stimulus might make the neuron fire more action potentials in a given time. Like, if the stimulus is just enough to reach the threshold, maybe it fires once, but a stronger one makes it fire multiple times quickly. So the number of action potentials per second could increase with intensity. That would make option F a possibility.

Wait, but another thought: the amplitude of the action potential is usually constant once it starts, right? The action potential is all-or-none, so whether it's a strong stimulus or just enough, the height of the peak doesn't change. So option C might not be the right answer because it's not varying with intensity.

What about option D, the number of neurons activated? If a stronger stimulus activates more neurons, that could signal intensity. But I think the primary way is through the rate of firing in a single neuron, not necessarily recruiting more neurons. Although I'm not entirely sure, but I lean towards the idea that it's the rate rather than the number of neurons.

Option F says the number of action potentials per second. That makes sense because if the stimulus is stronger, the neuron might fire more rapidly. So more APs per second would correlate with higher intensity. Like, if you have a weak touch, maybe the neuron fires once, but a harder touch makes it fire twice as fast. So the rate increases with intensity.

Another angle: the concept of "intensity" in stimuli often relates to the number of times a neuron fires within a certain period. So the brain perceives a stronger stimulus because the firing rate is higher, which the thalamus and cortex interpret as more intense.

So putting it together, the correct answer is F because the number of action potentials per second varies with stimulus intensity.
