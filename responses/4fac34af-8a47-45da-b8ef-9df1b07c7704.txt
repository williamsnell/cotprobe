Okay, I've got this question about the total spin quantum number for the electrons in the ground state of neutral nitrogen. Nitrogen has an atomic number Z=7, so it has seven electrons. I remember that electrons fill up the lowest energy levels first, so I need to figure out the electron configuration for nitrogen.

Let me think: the first shell is K, which can hold 2 electrons. The next is L, which can hold 8, and then M holds up to 18, but we probably won't go that far here. So, for Z=7, the configuration should be 1s² 2s² 2p³. Right? Because 2+2+3 equals 7.

Now, each electron has a spin quantum number, which can be either +1/2 or -1/2. Electrons in the same orbital must have opposite spins due to the Pauli exclusion principle. But wait, the p orbital can hold up to 6 electrons, but nitrogen only has 3 in the 2p orbital. So those three electrons are in the same energy level but different orbitals.

Wait, no, the 2p subshell has three orbitals: px, py, pz. Each can hold two electrons. So for three electrons, each will go into a separate orbital, each with a spin of 1/2. So each of the three p electrons is in a different orbital, each with spin up. So for each, the spin is 1/2, but when considering the total spin, I think I need to add them up vectorially.

Wait, no, the total spin quantum number S is the sum of the individual spins. But I'm a bit confused about how that works when you have multiple electrons. Because S isn't just the sum of the individual s's; it's more about the combination of their spins.

So each electron has s=1/2. For the three p electrons, they each have s=1/2. But how do their spins add up? I remember something about adding spins in a triplet state or something like that.

Wait, when you have two electrons, their spins can combine to give S = 1 (triplet) or S=0 (singlet). But with three electrons, it's a bit more complicated. Let me think. For three electrons, each has spin 1/2, so the total spin can be calculated by adding them pairwise.

Alternatively, I could think of the three electrons as each having parallel spins as much as possible, but that might not be the case. Wait, in the ground state, electrons fill orbitals with the same spin if possible to minimize repulsion. Oh right, Hund's rule! Hund's rule says that electrons will fill degenerate orbitals with parallel spins as much as possible.

So in the 2p³ case, each of the three electrons will have parallel spins, meaning all three have spin up. So each has s=1/2, and all are aligned.

Wait, but each electron's spin is a vector, so adding them gives the total spin. For three electrons each with spin 1/2, how do we add them?

Wait, the total spin S is the result of combining the individual spins. For two electrons, the maximum S is 1 (when they're aligned) and minimum 0 (when opposite). For three electrons, I think we can pair two first and then add the third.

So let's say we have two electrons first. Their combined spin can be S=1 (triplet) or S=0 (singlet). Then adding the third electron's spin (1/2) to each case.

Case 1: Two electrons with S=1 (triplet). Adding a third with s=1/2. So the possible total spins are S = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2 and S = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2.

Case 2: Two electrons with S=0 (singlet). Adding a third s=1/2. So possible S= 0 + 1/2 = 1/2, and S= |0 -1/2|=1/2. So in this case, the total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2.

But according to Hund's rule, the maximum spin is favored to minimize repulsion. So the ground state would have maximum spin. So for three parallel spins, the total S should be 3*(1/2) = 3/2? Wait, no, because when adding vectors, you can't just add the magnitudes directly. The maximum possible S for three electrons is 3/2, I think. Because each contributes +1/2, so adding them gives 3*(1/2) = 3/2. But wait, that's not the way quantum spin addition works. Let me think again.

The addition of spins is more involved. For two electrons, the maximum S is 1 (when aligned). For three electrons, the maximum would be when all three are aligned, so S= (1/2)*3 = 3/2? Or wait, perhaps I should think of it as adding each electron's spin one by one.

So first, two electrons: possible S=1 or 0. Then add the third.

If the first two have S=1, adding a third with S=1/2 would give possible total S= 1 + 1/2 = 3/2 and S=1 - 1/2=1/2.

If the first two have S=0, adding a third gives S=1/2.

So the possible total S values are 3/2 and 1/2. The maximum is 3/2, so that's the ground state configuration because it's lower in energy (Hund's rule, maximum multiplicity).

Therefore, the total spin quantum number S is 3/2.

Wait, but wait: the total spin quantum number is S, which can be 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, etc. So in the case of three electrons, the maximum S is 3/2.

So looking at the options, option J is 3/2. So the answer should be J.

The ground state electron configuration of neutral nitrogen (Z = 7) is determined by filling the lowest energy levels first: 1s² 2s² 2p³. In the 2p subshell, there are three orbitals (px, py, pz), each of which can hold two electrons. However, nitrogen only has three electrons in the 2p subshell, so each electron occupies a separate orbital with parallel spins (as per Hund's rule) to maximize spin multiplicity.

Each electron has a spin quantum number \( s = \frac{1}{2} \). When combining the spins of the three electrons, the total spin quantum number \( S \) is calculated by vector addition. The maximum possible \( S \) occurs when all three spins are aligned, resulting in \( S = \frac{3}{2} \). This configuration is favored in the ground state due to Hund's rule, which minimizes electron repulsion and stabilizes the system.

Thus, the total spin quantum number of the electrons in the ground state of neutral nitrogen is \( \frac{3}{2} \).
