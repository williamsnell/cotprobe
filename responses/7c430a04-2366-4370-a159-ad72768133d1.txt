Okay, so I have this question about why milk spoils when kept in the refrigerator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my food science, but let me think it through. 

First, I know that refrigeration slows down bacterial growth because bacteria need a certain temperature to thrive. So if milk spoils in the fridge, it's probably not because the fridge isn't working (option C says loss of refrigeration power, but that would mean the milk wouldn't get cold, right? So maybe C isn't the right answer). 

The options mention various factors: enzymatic reactions, crystallization, acidification, different types of bacteria, and so on. I remember that milk spoiling involves bacteria. When you refrigerate milk, you slow down the bad bacteria, but they don't die completely. Over time, these bacteria can multiply enough to cause spoilage. 

Wait, which types of bacteria are involved here? There are psychrophiles, which are cold-loving bacteria, right? They can grow at low temperatures, so when you keep milk in the fridge, psychrophilic bacteria might be the ones causing spoilage over time (option G). 

Other options: thermophiles require high temps, so they wouldn't grow in the fridge. Mesophiles prefer moderate temps, so maybe room temp but not so much in the fridge. Enzymatic reactions with oxygen (option A) might refer to oxidation, but I'm not sure if that's the main cause for spoilage. Lactose crystallization (B) sounds more like when milk starts to form crystals, maybe when it's old, but I think that's a symptom rather than the cause. Acidification from light (F) doesn't make much sense; light exposure isn't usually a factor in fridge storage. 

Option I is chemical reactions. While milk does undergo some chemical changes, the main spoilage is due to microbial activity. So probably not I. Option J is contamination from other foods, but that's more about cross-contamination, not the inherent spoiling process. 

So putting it together, the main reason is likely psychrophilic bacteria (option G) growing in the fridge, leading to milk spoilage over time.

The primary reason milk spoils in the refrigerator is due to the growth of psychrophilic bacteria, which thrive at low temperatures. These bacteria break down milk components, causing spoilage.
