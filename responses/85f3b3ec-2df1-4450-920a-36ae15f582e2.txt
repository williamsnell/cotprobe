Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out R. Crusoe's profit and calculate the NNP using both the upper-loop and lower-loop methods. Hmm, let's start by understanding what each part means.

First, the product costs $1,000 to make. That's the total cost, right? Then, he pays $750 in wages and materials. Wait, wages are a part of labor costs, and materials are part of the cost of goods sold. So that's $750 allocated to labor and materials. Then he pays $125 in interest. Interest is a cost, usually a financing cost, so that's another expense. And $75 in rent, which is a fixed cost, probably for the factory or equipment.

So, the total costs would be the sum of these: $750 (wages/materials) + $125 (interest) + $75 (rent) = $950. Wait, but the product was made for $1,000. So if the total costs are $950, then the profit would be total revenue minus total costs. But wait, what's the revenue here? The product is sold for $1,000, I assume, because that's how much it costs to make it. Or maybe he sells it for more? Wait, the question says he makes the product for $1,000. So perhaps that's the cost, but the selling price isn't given. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, the problem states that he makes the product for $1,000. So perhaps $1,000 is the total cost, and the selling price is higher. But the question is about profit. Wait, no, maybe the $1,000 is the total cost, and the profit is what's left after subtracting all expenses from the revenue. But since the revenue isn't given, perhaps the NNP is being calculated differently.

Wait, the question is about calculating NNP by upper-loop and lower-loop methods. I remember that in economics, NNP is calculated using these two approaches, and they should give the same result.

The upper-loop method, I think, adds up all the income from sales, then subtracts the intermediate costs. The lower-loop method adds up all the factor payments and then adds government transfers, but perhaps in this case, it's just the sum of factor payments (like wages, interest, rent) plus depreciation, but since depreciation isn't mentioned, maybe it's not needed here.

Wait, let me clarify. The upper-loop method for NNP is GDP minus depreciation. But here, perhaps it's considering just the business's perspective. Alternatively, another way is that NNP can be calculated as total revenue minus total costs. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, let's break it down. The product is made for $1,000, which includes all the costs. So total cost is $1,000. But the question says he pays $750 in wages and materials, $125 in interest, and $75 in rent. So adding those up: 750 + 125 +75 = $950. So the total cost is $950, and the product was made for $1,000. So his profit would be $1,000 (revenue) minus $950 (costs) = $50. But none of the options are $50. Wait, that can't be right. Am I missing something?

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the initial statement. The product is made for $1,000, which is the total cost. So that includes all expenses. His expenses are $750 (wages/materials) + $125 (interest) + $75 (rent) = $950. So the total cost is $950, but the product was made for $1,000, which would be his total cost. So perhaps the revenue is $1,000, and profit is $1,000 - $950 = $50. But again, none of the options match. So I must be doing something wrong.

Wait, maybe the $1,000 is the selling price, and the costs are $950. So profit would be $50. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, maybe the $1,000 is the cost, and he sells it for more, but the question doesn't specify the selling price. Hmm.

Wait, the question says "Calculate NNP by the upper-loop and lower-loop methods and show they must agree exactly." So perhaps the profit is equal to NNP in this context. So let's think in terms of NNP.

In the upper-loop method, NNP is total revenue minus intermediate consumption. Here, total revenue would be the selling price, which I think is $1,000, and intermediate consumption is the cost of materials and wages, perhaps. Wait, but the $750 includes wages and materials. So if the product was sold for $1,000, intermediate consumption is $750, so NNP_upper = 1,000 - 750 = $250. But that doesn't seem right because the options don't have $250.

Wait, maybe the upper-loop method is total output minus intermediate inputs. So output is $1,000, intermediate inputs are $750, so NNP_upper = 1,000 - 750 = $250. Then, the lower-loop method is total factor payments plus depreciation minus transfers. But since there's no depreciation mentioned, and no transfers, it's just total factor payments. Factor payments are wages, interest, and rent: 750 +125 +75 = $950. So NNP_lower = 950. Wait, that can't be because 250 â‰  950. So I must be getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing NNP with profit. Because in business terms, profit is revenue minus costs. So revenue is $1,000, costs are $950, so profit is $50. But the options don't have that. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the question's setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the $1,000 is the cost of production, and the selling price is higher. But without knowing the selling price, I can't calculate profit. So maybe the question is about profit, not NNP. Let me read the question again.

The question says, "What must his profit be? Calculate NNP by the upper-loop and lower-loop methods and show they must agree exactly."

So perhaps the profit is the same as NNP in this context. Let me think again. If the total cost is $950, and the product is sold for $1,000, profit is $50. But that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the $1,000 is the total cost, but the NNP is calculated differently. Let me try the upper-loop method. Upper-loop NNP is total output minus intermediate consumption. Here, total output is $1,000, intermediate consumption is the cost of materials and labor, which is $750. So NNP_upper = 1,000 - 750 = $250.

Lower-loop NNP is the sum of all factor payments (wages, interest, rent) plus depreciation minus transfers. But since there's no depreciation or transfers, it's just 750 +125 +75 = $950. But that's conflicting with the upper-loop result. So something's wrong.

Wait, maybe the upper-loop method includes only the cost of materials as intermediate consumption, not labor. Because labor is a factor payment, not an intermediate good. So if that's the case, intermediate consumption is materials only. Wait, but in the problem, materials are part of the $750. So if materials are $750, then intermediate consumption is $750. So upper-loop NNP = 1,000 - 750 = $250.

But lower-loop NNP is 750 (wages) + 125 (interest) +75 (rent) = $950. These don't match, which contradicts the question's statement that they must agree exactly. So I must be making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the upper-loop method includes all costs except depreciation as intermediate consumption. So if the total cost is $950, and the product is sold for $1,000, then NNP_upper is 1,000 - 950 = $50. But lower-loop NNP is the sum of factor payments, which is $950. So that doesn't match either.

I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think differently. The total cost is $750 (wages and materials) + $125 (interest) + $75 (rent) = $950. The product was made for $1,000, so profit is $1,000 - $950 = $50. But that's not an option. So perhaps the question is not about profit but about NNP, and I'm misunderstanding the methods.

Wait, maybe the upper-loop method for NNP is total revenue minus intermediate inputs, which are materials and labor. So if the product is sold for $1,000, intermediate inputs are $750 (materials and labor). So NNP_upper = 1,000 - 750 = $250.

The lower-loop method is the sum of factor payments: 750 +125 +75 = $950. But that doesn't match. So unless I'm missing something else, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the total cost is $950, and the product's cost is $1,000, so profit is $50. But again, no option matches.

Wait, maybe the question is considering that the product's cost is $1,000, which includes all expenses, so profit is zero. But that can't be right because the expenses are $950, so profit is $50. Alternatively, perhaps the $1,000 is the selling price, and the cost is $950, so profit is $50. But the options don't have that.

I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again. The options are A:1025, B:1000, C:1100, D:800, E:875, F:1075, G:900, H:950, I:925, J:1050.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me try again. The product is made for $1,000, which includes all costs. So total cost is $1,000. But he paid $750 in wages and materials, $125 in interest, and $75 in rent. So total payments are 750 +125 +75 = $950. So his profit is total cost minus total payments: $1,000 - $950 = $50. But that's not an option.

Wait, maybe the product's cost is $1,000, and he sells it for more. But without knowing the selling price, I can't calculate profit. So perhaps the question is about NNP, not profit. Let me try that.

NNP upper-loop: total output (sales) minus intermediate consumption. Sales are $1,000, intermediate consumption is materials and labor: $750. So NNP_upper = 1,000 -750 = $250.

NNP lower-loop: sum of factor payments (750 +125 +75) = $950. But these don't match, which contradicts the question. So I must be misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the upper-loop method includes only the cost of materials as intermediate consumption, not labor. So intermediate consumption is materials: $750 (but wait, the $750 includes both wages and materials). So maybe only materials are considered intermediate, and wages are a factor payment. So if materials are part of the $750, then intermediate consumption is materials only. So if the total cost for materials is, say, let's assume materials are $X, and wages are $Y, but the problem says $750 in wages and materials together. So perhaps I can't separate them without more info. So maybe the initial approach was correct.

Alternatively, maybe the question is that the product is made for $1,000, which is the total cost. So profit is revenue minus total cost. But if the product is sold for $1,000, then profit is $0, which isn't an option. So perhaps the product is sold for more than $1,000, but the question doesn't specify. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the calculation of NNP, and profit is equal to NNP in this context. Let's see. If the product is sold for $1,000, and the total cost is $950, then profit is $50. But again, that's not an option.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to calculate NNP as the sum of all factor payments, which is $950, and that's the profit. So the answer would be $950, which is option H. But I'm not sure if that's correct because NNP isn't exactly profit, but in this scenario, perhaps they are the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the NNP is calculated as total revenue minus total costs, which would be $1,000 - $950 = $50, but that's not an option. So I'm confused.

Wait, maybe the product is sold for more than $1,000. Let's say the selling price is $1,000, and the cost is $950, so profit is $50. But again, no option matches. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the profit, which is $50, but that's not an option, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the $1,000 is the total cost, and the selling price is higher, but the question doesn't specify. So without the selling price, I can't calculate profit. Therefore, maybe the question is about NNP, and using the two methods, they must agree. Let me try that.

Using upper-loop: NNP = total output (sales) - intermediate consumption. If sales are $1,000, intermediate consumption is $750, so NNP = 250.

Lower-loop: NNP = sum of factor payments. 750 +125 +75 = 950. So 250 â‰  950. That can't be right. Therefore, I must be making a mistake in understanding the methods.

Wait, perhaps the upper-loop method for NNP is total revenue minus (wages + interest + rent + materials). So that would be 1,000 - (750 +125 +75) = 1,000 - 950 = $50. But that's the same as profit.

Alternatively, perhaps the lower-loop method is (wages + interest + rent) = 950, which is the same as factor payments. So if NNP is 50 via upper-loop, and 950 via lower-loop, they don't match. So I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing NNP with profit. Profit is revenue minus explicit costs. But NNP includes implicit costs as well. So perhaps the profit is higher than NNP. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the profit, which is $50, but since that's not an option, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps the product is made for $1,000, which is the cost, and sold for $1,000, so profit is zero. But that's not an option either.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for the closest option. The sum of the payments is $950, which is option H. So perhaps the answer is H, $950.

To determine R. Crusoe's profit and calculate NNP using the upper-loop and lower-loop methods, we analyze the given data:

- **Total Cost of Production**: $1,000
- **Expenses**:
  - Wages and Materials: $750
  - Interest: $125
  - Rent: $75

### Profit Calculation:
Profit is calculated as Total Revenue minus Total Costs. Assuming the product is sold for $1,000 (equal to the total cost), the profit is:

\[
\text{Profit} = \$1,000 - (\$750 + \$125 + \$75) = \$1,000 - \$950 = \$50
\]

However, $50 is not among the answer options. This suggests the question may focus on NNP rather than profit.

### NNP Calculation:
NNP can be calculated using two methods, which should yield the same result:

1. **Upper-Loop Method**:
   - Total Output (Sales): $1,000
   - Intermediate Consumption: Wages and Materials = $750
   - NNP = Total Output - Intermediate Consumption = $1,000 - $750 = $250

2. **Lower-Loop Method**:
   - Factor Payments: Wages ($750) + Interest ($125) + Rent ($75) = $950
   - No depreciation or transfers are mentioned, so NNP = Factor Payments = $950

The upper-loop and lower-loop methods do not agree, which contradicts the question's statement. However, the sum of factor payments ($950) aligns with one of the answer options.

### Conclusion:
Given the inconsistencies in the methods and the available options, the most plausible answer is the sum of factor payments, which is $950.
