Alright, I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about voting laws and what must be true if the law is upheld by the court. Let me think through this step by step.

So, the question is about a voting law being reviewed, and if it's upheld, what condition must be met. I remember that when courts review laws, especially ones that involve fundamental rights like voting, they apply a certain standard of scrutiny. I think it's strict scrutiny in such cases because voting is a fundamental right under the Constitution.

Strict scrutiny is a high bar. For a law to be upheld under strict scrutiny, the government must show that the law serves a compelling government interest and that it's narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. Narrowly tailored means it's the least restrictive means, so the law should be necessary to achieve that compelling purpose.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that aligns with strict scrutiny. Let's go through each option:

A: The law is necessary for a legitimate government purpose.
- This sounds close, but I think it's more about necessity and a legitimate purpose. Maybe under a lower standard, but not necessarily strict scrutiny.

B: The law is rationally related to an important government purpose.
- This is more like the rational basis test, which is a lower standard. Not what we're looking for here.

C: The law is unnecessarily related to a compelling government purpose.
- Unnecessarily doesn't make sense here; the law needs to be necessary, not unnecessary.

D: The law is substantially related to an important government purpose.
- Substantially related is a bit vague. Under strict scrutiny, it's more about being necessary to achieve a compelling purpose.

E: The law is necessary to achieve a compelling government purpose.
- This seems to fit. Under strict scrutiny, the law must be necessary for a compelling purpose.

F: The law is moderately related to a compelling government purpose.
- Moderately isn't the right term; it needs to be necessary or closely related.

G: The law is rationally related to a legitimate government purpose.
- Again, this is rational basis, not strict scrutiny.

H: The law is vaguely related to a significant government purpose.
- Vague is too weak; strict scrutiny requires a clear, direct relationship.

I: The law is substantially unrelated to any government purpose.
- If this were true, the law would likely be struck down, not upheld.

J: The law is substantially related to a legitimate government purpose.
- Substantially related is better, but under strict scrutiny, it's more about necessity for a compelling purpose. So this might not be the best fit.

Wait, so E says "necessary to achieve a compelling government purpose," which aligns with strict scrutiny. D and J talk about being related, but not necessarily the necessity part. So I think E is the correct answer because under strict scrutiny, both a compelling purpose and the law being narrowly tailored (necessary) are required.

I should also consider if any other options could be correct. For example, option J says "substantially related to a legitimate government purpose." But "legitimate" is a lower bar than "compelling." So J might be applicable under a different standard, maybe intermediate scrutiny, but not strict.

Therefore, the best answer is E.

The correct answer is E because, under strict scrutiny, the law must be necessary to achieve a compelling government purpose. This aligns with the high standard required for upholding laws affecting fundamental rights like voting.

Answer: E
