Okay, so I have this question about when Greek philosophers rejected the anthropomorphic view of the divine. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking.

Anthropomorphic view of the divine means seeing gods as having human-like forms and characteristics. So, the question is about when Greek philosophers started moving away from this idea. I remember that earlier Greek religions, like in Homer's time, the gods were very anthropomorphicâ€”Zeus, Hera, etc., all with human traits and stories.

I think the shift happened during the philosophical period when people started seeing the divine in a more abstract way, maybe as a single principle or something non-anthropomorphic. I recall that the Pre-Socratic philosophers like Thales, Anaximander, and Xenophanes were early in this movement. Thales, for example, thought the universe was governed by natural laws rather than anthropomorphic gods.

Thales was around the 6th century BCE, specifically the late part. Xenophanes, I think, was also around that time, maybe late 6th century. He criticized the anthropomorphic views, saying that if oxen had gods, they'd look like oxen. So he was moving towards a more abstract concept.

Then there's the later philosophers like Plato and Aristotle. Plato talked about the Forms, which are abstract, but I'm not sure if that's the major shift the question is referring to. The major shift from anthropomorphic to more abstract or philosophical concepts probably started earlier, with the Pre-Socratics.

Looking at the options: A is Late Sixth Century BCE, which would fit Thales and Xenophanes. C is Early Fifth Century, which is a bit later. D is Late Fourth Century, which is when Aristotle was around. But the shift started earlier, so maybe A is the right answer.

Wait, but some sources say that the shift happened around the 6th and 5th centuries BCE. So maybe the major shift was in the late 6th century. Also, the question is about when the major shift occurred, so the time when they started rejecting it would be the late 6th century BCE, which is option A.

I think that makes sense because the Pre-Socratic period, especially in Ionia, had philosophers like Thales and Anaximenes who were pushing against the traditional views. So the answer should be A.

The major shift by Greek philosophers rejecting the anthropomorphic view of the divine occurred during the Late Sixth Century BCE. This period saw figures like Thales and Xenophanes move away from traditional anthropomorphic gods towards more abstract concepts, marking the beginning of philosophical thought in this area.
