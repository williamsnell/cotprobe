Okay, so I've got this geography question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is asking about what latitude and longitude coordinates are an example of. The options are from A to J, each representing a different term. Let me go through each option one by one to see which one fits best.

First, I need to remember what latitude and longitude are. Latitude lines are horizontal lines that run east to west, measuring how far north or south a point is from the equator. Longitude lines are vertical, running north to south, and measure how far east or west a point is from the prime meridian. So together, they give a precise point on the Earth's surface, right?

Now, looking at the options:

A: An arbitrary location. Hmm, arbitrary usually means something chosen without a specific reason. But latitude and longitude are specific and based on a system, so maybe not arbitrary.

B: A relative region. Relative location refers to where a place is in relation to other places, like saying it's north of somewhere else. But latitude and longitude are absolute, not relative.

C: A functional region. That's an area organized around a central point, like a city's influence area. Doesn't seem to fit because coordinates don't define regions based on function.

D: A topographic location. Topographic relates to the physical features of the land. Coordinates don't directly describe physical features, so probably not this one.

E: A formal region. Formal regions are areas with specific boundaries, like countries or states. Coordinates don't define a region but a specific point.

F: A relative location. Wait, relative location is about describing a place in relation to others. But latitude and longitude are absolute, giving exact positions, so this might not be right.

G: A nominal location. Nominal refers to names, like a city name. Coordinates are numerical, not names, so probably not this.

H: An absolute location. Absolute location refers to the exact position on Earth, which is exactly what latitude and longitude provide. This seems correct.

I: A geospatial location. Geospatial relates to the physical properties of a place, like elevation or coordinates. Coordinates are definitely geospatial, but I'm not sure if this is the best fit. Let me think... The question is asking for an example, and I think the more specific term is absolute location.

J: A geographical region. Again, regions are areas, not specific points. So this doesn't fit.

So putting it all together, latitude and longitude give an exact, precise point, which is an absolute location. Therefore, the answer should be H.

The latitude and longitude coordinates of a place provide an exact, precise position on Earth, which is an example of an absolute location.

Answer: H
