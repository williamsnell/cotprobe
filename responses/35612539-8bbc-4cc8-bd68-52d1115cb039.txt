Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about regression lines and residuals. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, let me recall what residuals are. Residuals are the differences between the observed values and the values predicted by the regression line. So for each data point, you subtract the predicted y (Å·) from the actual y, giving you the residual. That makes sense.

Now, the question asks which statement about residuals is true. There are 10 options, from A to J. I'll go through each one and see which makes sense.

Option A: The sum of the residuals is always one. Hmm, I'm not sure. I remember that when you fit a regression line, the sum of the residuals should theoretically be zero. Because the regression line is the best fit in terms of minimizing the sum of squared residuals, which leads the average residual to be zero. So if the sum is always one, that's probably wrong. I don't think that's correct.

Option B: If the correlation is 0, there will be a distinct pattern in the residual plot. Wait, if the correlation is zero, that means there's no linear relationship. So the residual plot would probably show no particular pattern, maybe a random scatter. But the option says there's a distinct pattern. That doesn't seem right. Because if the correlation is zero, the residuals wouldn't form a clear pattern; they'd be all over the place. So B is likely false.

Option C: The larger the residuals, the better the linear model. That doesn't make sense. Larger residuals mean that the model isn't explaining the data well. They indicate bigger errors. So a good model should have small residuals, not large ones. So C is incorrect.

Option D: The residuals are always negative. No, residuals can be positive or negative depending on whether the observed y is above or below the regression line. So D is false.

Option E: If the correlation is 1, there will be a distinct pattern in the residual plot. If the correlation is 1, that means all the points lie exactly on the regression line. So all residuals would be zero. The residual plot would just be a horizontal line at zero. That's definitely a distinct pattern. So E is true.

Option F: The residual plot will always be a straight line. No, the residual plot shows the residuals on the y-axis and the predicted values on the x-axis. If the residuals are random, the plot would not be a straight line. In fact, if the regression is good, the residuals should show no pattern, not a straight line. So F is false.

Option G: Influential scores have large residuals. Influential points are those that have a big effect on the regression line. They might have large residuals, but not necessarily. Sometimes they could be close to the line but still pull it a lot. So G isn't necessarily true. It's possible, but not always the case.

Option H: The mean of the residuals is always zero. I think this is correct because the regression line is calculated in such a way that the sum of the residuals is zero. So their average would be zero. So H is true.

Option I: If the linear model is good, the number of positive residuals will be the same as the number of negative residuals. That sounds plausible. If the residuals are symmetrically distributed around zero, then yes, the counts would be similar. But is this always true? Well, if the model perfectly fits, like in a perfect linear relationship, residuals are zero, so both counts are zero. But in a good model, maybe the positive and negative residuals balance out. So I think I is true.

Option J: The residuals can never be zero. No, residuals can be zero when the observed y exactly matches the predicted y. So J is false.

Wait, but earlier I thought H was true. Let me double-check. The mean of residuals is zero because the regression line is the best fit in terms of minimizing the sum of squared residuals, which forces the sum of residuals to be zero. So yes, H is correct.

But the question asks which statement is true. Let me look back at the options. Both E and H and I seem correct, but let me think again.

E says if the correlation is 1, the residual plot has a distinct pattern. That's true because all residuals are zero, so the plot is a straight line along zero.

H says the mean of residuals is always zero. That's correct because of how regression works.

I says if the model is good, the number of positive and negative residuals are the same. Well, in a perfect model, all residuals are zero, so both counts are zero. But in a good model, maybe they're roughly equal. I'm not sure if it's always exactly the same, but often they would be close. However, H is definitely correct.

Wait, the question is which statement is true. So multiple options could be correct, but looking at the options, perhaps both E and H are correct. But I need to check the options again.

Wait, the options are from A to J, and the question is which is true. So perhaps more than one is correct, but the options are presented as single answers. Wait, no, the options are individual; each is a possible answer.

Wait, the question is, "which of the following statements about residuals is true?" So perhaps only one is correct.

Let me go through each again.

A: Sum is one. No, it's zero.

B: Corr 0, pattern. No, no pattern.

C: Larger residuals better. No.

D: Always negative. No.

E: Corr 1, pattern. Yes, because residuals are all zero.

F: Residual plot straight line. No, unless perfect fit, but it's not always the case.

G: Influential have large residuals. Not necessarily.

H: Mean is zero. Yes.

I: Equal positive and negative. Not necessarily always, but often.

J: Never zero. No.

So E and H are correct. But looking back at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, the options are A to J, each is a separate statement. So perhaps both E and H are correct. But in the given options, only one would be the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Option H: The mean of the residuals is always zero. Yes, in linear regression, the sum is zero, so the mean is zero. So H is correct.

Option I: If the model is good, the number of positive and negative residuals are same. That's more about symmetry. If the residuals are symmetric, which a good model would have, then yes. But is it always the case? Well, in a perfect model, they're all zero. But in a good model, maybe they're roughly equal. So I think I is also correct.

But wait, the question is about which statement is true. So perhaps both E, H, and I are correct.

But looking back at the options, the correct answer is likely H. Because the sum of residuals is zero, so the mean is zero. So H is correct.

Wait, but the question may have more than one correct option, but in this case, perhaps H is correct.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me check each option again.

E: If correlation is 1, the residual plot has a distinct pattern. That's correct because all residuals are zero, so the plot is a straight line.

H: Mean of residuals is zero. Correct.

I: If model is good, same number of positive and negative residuals. That would be the case if residuals are symmetrically distributed. So if the model is good, residuals should be randomly scattered around zero with no pattern, so positive and negative would balance. So I is also correct.

But wait, the question is about which statement is true. So perhaps multiple are correct, but the options are presented as separate. So the correct answers would be E, H, and I.

But looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the question says "which of the following statements about residuals is true?" So perhaps only one is correct. Let me think again.

Option H: Mean is zero. Yes, correct.

Option I: If the model is good, same number of positive and negative. That's more about symmetry. In a perfect model, all residuals are zero, so both counts are zero. But in a good model, perhaps not exactly the same, but it's an assumption of linear regression that residuals are randomly distributed, so the number should be roughly the same. So I is also correct.

But the options are presented as A to J, so perhaps the correct answer is H. Because the mean is always zero.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is true. So both H and I are correct. But perhaps only H is correct.

Alternatively, let me check the options again. The options are:

E: If the correlation is 1, there will be a distinct pattern in the residual plot. Correct.

H: The mean of the residuals is always zero. Correct.

I: If the linear model is good, the number of positive residuals will be the same as the number of negative residuals. Also correct.

But the question is which is true, so perhaps all three are correct. But in the given options, perhaps only one is correct. Alternatively, maybe I is not necessarily always true.

Wait, the residuals can have positive and negative counts approximately equal if the model is good, but it's not necessarily exactly the same. So I is not always true. So perhaps only H and E are correct.

But the question allows for only one correct answer. Hmm.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps the correct answer is H.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects only H to be correct.

Wait, but I think E is also correct because if the correlation is 1, all residuals are zero, so the residual plot is a straight line along zero, which is a distinct pattern.

So perhaps both E and H are correct. But the options are separate, so perhaps the correct answer is H.

Wait, perhaps the question is designed so that only one option is correct. So I need to think again.

Option H: The mean of the residuals is always zero. Yes, because the regression line is calculated such that the sum of residuals is zero, so their mean is zero. So H is correct.

Option I: If the linear model is good, the number of positive and negative residuals are the same. This would be true if the residuals are symmetrically distributed, which is an assumption of linear regression. So I is also correct.

But the question is about which statement is true. So perhaps both H and I are correct. But the options are given as separate, so perhaps the correct answers are H and I.

But in the options, each is a separate choice. So perhaps the answer includes H and I, but the options don't allow for multiple selections. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H and I, but I need to choose the best one.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed so that H is correct.

Wait, but I think the correct answers are H and I. But since the options are separate, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is structured so that only H is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H and I.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think differently.

The question is about which statement is true. Let's go through each option again.

A: Sum is one. No, it's zero.

B: Corr 0, pattern. No, no pattern.

C: Larger residuals better. No.

D: Always negative. No.

E: Corr 1, pattern. Yes.

F: Residual plot straight line. No, only if perfect.

G: Influential have large residuals. Not necessarily.

H: Mean zero. Yes.

I: Equal positive and negative. Yes, if model is good.

J: Never zero. No.

So E, H, and I are correct. But the options are separate, so perhaps the correct answer includes H and I.

But the user is asking for a single letter. So perhaps the correct answer is H.

But wait, the question is from a test, so perhaps only one option is correct.

Wait, perhaps H is correct, but I is not necessarily always correct.

In reality, when the model is good, the residuals should have no trend and be randomly distributed, so the number of positive and negative residuals should be approximately equal. So I is correct.

So perhaps H and I are correct. But the options don't allow for multiple choices, so perhaps the intended answer is H.

But in the given options, perhaps H is correct.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. The correct statements are H and I, but in the options, I can only choose one. So perhaps the intended correct answer is H, because it's a fundamental property.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H and I, but the options don't allow that. So perhaps the correct answer is H.

Wait, but looking back, the options are A to J, each is a separate statement. So the correct answer would include all correct statements. But since the user is asking for one letter, perhaps the intended answer is H.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H and I.

But I think the intended correct answer is H: The mean of the residuals is always zero.

So I'll go with H.
</think>

The correct answer is H. The mean of the residuals is always zero because the regression line is fitted such that the sum of the residuals equals zero, ensuring the mean is also zero.
