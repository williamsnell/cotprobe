Okay, so I have this question about who is more likely to experience depression after a loss. The options are A through G. I'm a bit rusty on psychology, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the question is asking about factors that increase the risk of depression after a loss. I remember that social support is usually a protective factor. People with strong support networks tend to handle stress better. So option A says "Have a strong social support network," which probably doesn't make them more likely to get depressed. So maybe A is not the answer.

Option B: "Have no previous history of mental health issues." Hmm, I think having a history of mental health problems, like depression, would make someone more vulnerable. So if they've never had issues before, maybe they're less likely. So B might not be the right choice.

Option C: "Have not previously experienced depression." Wait, this is similar to B. If someone hasn't had depression before, maybe they're less likely to develop it after a loss. But I'm not sure. Maybe the opposite: those who have had it before are more at risk. So C could be a candidate, but I'm not certain yet.

Option D: "Have a high income." Higher income usually correlates with better access to resources and less stress related to poverty. So high income might reduce the risk, making D unlikely to be the answer.

Option E: "Have been married less than a year." Marriage can be a source of support, but being newly married might not have the same level of established support as longer marriages. Or maybe the stress of a recent marriage could affect someone's ability to cope with loss. Not sure. Maybe E isn't the best option.

Option F: "Are young survivors." I'm thinking about developmental stages. Young people might have fewer coping mechanisms or more life stressors. Alternatively, older people might be more set in their ways and have more to lose. I'm not sure. Maybe F is a contender.

Option G: "Are in good health." Good health is generally protective. If someone is healthy, they might handle the loss better. So G probably isn't the answer.

Wait, the question is about who is more likely to experience depression. So looking for factors that increase risk. 

I recall that having a history of mental health issues, especially depression, is a major risk factor. So option C says they haven't experienced depression before. That would mean they're less likely. So maybe the correct answer is the opposite: those who have had depression before. But that's not one of the options. The options are about who is more likely, so perhaps the correct answer is someone who hasn't had it before, but that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm mixing up.

Wait, perhaps the question is about those who are more likely, so if someone hasn't had depression before, maybe the loss is more impactful. Or maybe the presence of a history makes them more likely. Let me think again.

Another angle: people with no prior mental health issues might not have the coping mechanisms. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe being young (option F) is a risk factor because they're still developing emotionally. Or perhaps being in poor health (not G) would be a factor, but G says they're in good health, so that's protective.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the opposite. Those without social support (A) are more at risk. But the option says "have a strong social support network," which is protective, so A isn't the answer.

So, the answer is probably C or F. Because C says they haven't experienced depression before, which might mean this is their first time, making them more vulnerable. Alternatively, F could be about age.

I think the correct answer is C: Have not previously experienced depression. Because if someone hasn't had depression before, the loss might be more overwhelming. Or maybe it's the opposite. I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, I think people who have had depression before are more likely to relapse. So if the question is about those who are more likely, it would be those who have had it before. But that's not one of the options. The options are about who is more likely, so perhaps the correct answer is C, because if they haven't had it before, they might not have the resilience.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Those with a history are more likely. Since C says they haven't, then they are less likely. So maybe the correct answer is someone who has a history, but that's not an option here. Therefore, perhaps the answer is C, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is F: Are young survivors. Because younger people might have more difficulty coping with loss. Or maybe it's E: Have been married less than a year. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: looking for risk factors. Lack of social support increases risk, but A says they have strong support, so A is protective. High income (D) is protective. Good health (G) is protective. So the risk factors would be those without these protective factors.

So the answer is probably someone who doesn't have these protective factors. So if someone has no previous mental health issues (B), that might mean they're less prepared. Or maybe someone who hasn't experienced depression before (C) is more vulnerable.

I'm still a bit stuck. Maybe the answer is C: Have not previously experienced depression. Because if you've never been depressed, you might not have the coping mechanisms or awareness to handle it after a loss. Alternatively, people with a history are more likely, but that's not an option.

Wait, the options are about who is more likely. So the answer is those who are more vulnerable. I think the correct answer is C: Have not previously experienced depression. Because without prior experience, the loss might be more devastating.

The question asks which group is more likely to experience depression after a loss. To determine the answer, each option is analyzed for its likelihood of increasing the risk of depression. 

- **Option A**: A strong social support network is generally protective, reducing the risk of depression. Therefore, this is unlikely to be the correct answer.  
- **Option B**: Having no previous history of mental health issues might suggest lower vulnerability, making this option less likely.  
- **Option C**: Those who have not previously experienced depression might be more vulnerable because they lack prior coping mechanisms or resilience, making this a strong candidate.  
- **Option D**: A high income typically provides more resources and reduces stress, making this option unlikely.  
- **Option E**: Being married less than a year could indicate less established support, but this is less directly linked to depression risk compared to other factors.  
- **Option F**: Young survivors might face developmental challenges, but this is less definitive than other options.  
- **Option G**: Being in good health is protective, so this is unlikely to be the answer.  

After considering the factors, the most plausible answer is **C: Have not previously experienced depression**, as individuals without prior experience may be more vulnerable to the emotional impact of a loss.  

Answer: C
