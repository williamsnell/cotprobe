Okay, so I have this question about Captain Marvel's abilities, and I need to figure out which one isn't one of his powers. The options are from A to J, each tied to a different Greek god or hero. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that Captain Marvel, also known as Carol Danvers, has a variety of superhuman abilities. She's one of the strongest superheroes, so I'm guessing some of these options are about strength and related powers. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: the strength of Hercules. Hercules is known for his incredible strength, and I think Captain Marvel is indeed super strong. So that's probably one of her abilities.

Option B: the endurance of Atlas. Atlas was a Titan who carried the world on his shoulders, symbolizing great endurance. Captain Marvel's powers include superhuman stamina and endurance, so this sounds right.

Option C: the insight of Athena. Athena is the Greek goddess of wisdom and strategy. Insight would relate to wisdom or strategic thinking. I'm not sure if Captain Marvel specifically has this as an ability, but I think she's smart, so maybe this is correct.

Option D: the speed of Hermes. Hermes is the messenger god, known for his speed. I believe Captain Marvel can fly and move quickly, but I'm not certain if her speed equals that of Hermes. Maybe, maybe not.

Option E: the courage of Achilles. Achilles was a great warrior with courage. Captain Marvel is definitely courageous, so this might be one of her traits.

Option F: the healing of Asclepius. Asclepius is the god of healing. I don't recall Captain Marvel having healing powers. She was injured in her past, but I think she relies on her strength and other abilities, not healing. This might be the incorrect one.

Option G: the agility of Artemis. Artemis is associated with agility and hunting. Captain Marvel is agile, especially in combat, so this is likely one of her abilities.

Option H: the wisdom of Solomon. King Solomon is known for his wisdom. While Captain Marvel is smart, I'm not sure if her wisdom is tied to Solomon. Maybe, maybe not.

Option I: the power of Apollo. Apollo is a god with many powers, including solar energy. Captain Marvel can generate energy and has various powers, so this might fit.

Option J: the stealth of Hades. Hades is the god of the underworld, not really known for stealth. I don't think Captain Marvel has stealth abilities. She's more about strength and combat, not sneaking around.

Wait, so let me think again. The question is asking which is NOT one of her abilities. So I need to find the option that doesn't fit.

From what I remember, Captain Marvel has superhuman strength (so A is correct), endurance (B), speed (maybe D?), agility (G), courage (E), and power (I). She doesn't have healing (F) or wisdom of Solomon (H). But wait, does she have insight like Athena? Maybe that's part of her wisdom. 

Wait, let's think about each ability:

- Strength of Hercules: Yes.
- Endurance of Atlas: Yes.
- Insight of Athena: Maybe, as part of her intelligence.
- Speed of Hermes: She's fast, but not sure if it's at the level of Hermes.
- Courage of Achilles: Yes.
- Healing of Asclepius: No, she doesn't heal.
- Agility of Artemis: Yes.
- Wisdom of Solomon: Maybe, but not sure.
- Power of Apollo: She can manipulate energy, so maybe.
- Stealth of Hades: No, she's not known for stealth.

Wait, so both F and J are not abilities. But the options are only one correct answer. Maybe I'm mixing up something.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the specific aspects from the comics. Let me think again.

In the comics, Captain Marvel's powers include superhuman strength, speed, agility, stamina, flight, and energy projection. She's also very smart, but I don't think she has healing powers. So F is not an ability.

As for the others:

- A: Strength of Hercules – correct.
- B: Endurance of Atlas – correct.
- C: Insight of Athena – maybe, as she's intelligent.
- D: Speed of Hermes – she's fast, but not sure if it's Hermes-level.
- E: Courage of Achilles – correct.
- G: Agility of Artemis – correct.
- H: Wisdom of Solomon – not sure, but she's wise.
- I: Power of Apollo – correct, as she can project energy.
- J: Stealth of Hades – incorrect, she doesn't have stealth.

Wait, but the options are from A to J, and the question is which is NOT. So if both F and J are incorrect, but only one is an option. Let me check the options again.

Looking back, the options are:

A: strength of Hercules – correct.

B: endurance of Atlas – correct.

C: insight of Athena – maybe correct.

D: speed of Hermes – correct.

E: courage of Achilles – correct.

F: healing of Asclepius – incorrect.

G: agility of Artemis – correct.

H: wisdom of Solomon – correct (she's wise).

I: power of Apollo – correct.

J: stealth of Hades – incorrect.

Wait, but in the question, only one option is correct. So perhaps the answer is J: the stealth of Hades, because she's not known for stealth. Alternatively, F: healing of Asclepius is also not an ability.

Wait, in the original comics, does Carol have healing powers? I don't think so. She can fly, is strong, can project energy, but not heal. So F is not an ability.

But the question is which is NOT one of her abilities. So either F or J.

Looking back, the options are:

A-J, and each is tied to a Greek figure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is J: the stealth of Hades, because Hades is the god of the underworld, not associated with stealth. Alternatively, stealth is more of a ninja thing, and Hades isn't known for that.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is F: the healing of Asclepius, as she doesn't have healing powers.

Wait, but in some versions, maybe she does? I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

I think the correct answer is F: the healing of Asclepius, because she doesn't have healing powers. Or maybe J: stealth of Hades, as she's not a stealth character.

Wait, in the original comics, Captain Marvel doesn't have stealth abilities. So J is not an ability.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is F, because healing is a separate thing.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to recall: in the MCU, does Captain Marvel have any healing factor? No, she doesn't. So F is not an ability.

But the question is about her abilities, not necessarily from the MCU but from the comics. In the comics, does she have healing? I don't think so. So F is not an ability.

But the options are A-J, and the correct answer is F or J.

Wait, the options are:

A: strength of Hercules – correct.

B: endurance of Atlas – correct.

C: insight of Athena – correct.

D: speed of Hermes – correct.

E: courage of Achilles – correct.

F: healing of Asclepius – incorrect.

G: agility of Artemis – correct.

H: wisdom of Solomon – correct.

I: power of Apollo – correct.

J: stealth of Hades – incorrect.

So both F and J are incorrect. But the question is which is NOT one, implying only one option is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the abilities. Let me think again.

In the comics, Captain Marvel has superhuman strength, speed, agility, flight, energy projection, and intelligence. She doesn't have healing or stealth.

So both F and J are not abilities. But the options only have one correct answer. Maybe the intended answer is F: the healing of Asclepius.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is J: the stealth of Hades.

Wait, perhaps the answer is J because Hades isn't known for stealth. Alternatively, maybe the answer is F.

I think the intended answer is F: the healing of Asclepius, because she doesn't have healing powers.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is J: stealth of Hades.

Wait, I think the correct answer is F: the healing of Asclepius, because she doesn't have healing abilities.

The question asks which ability is not one of Captain Marvel's. After analyzing each option, both F (healing of Asclepius) and J (stealth of Hades) are not abilities of Captain Marvel. However, since the question implies only one correct answer, F: the healing of Asclepius is the most likely choice, as healing is not one of her powers.

Answer: F
