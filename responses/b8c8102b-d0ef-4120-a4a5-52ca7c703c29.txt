Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about abdominal masses, and I need to figure out which statement is true. Let me read through the options carefully and think about each one.

Option A: An indentible mass is caused by faecal loading of the colon. Hmm, I remember that when the colon is filled with faeces, it can create a mass that's soft and movable. So if you press on it, it might indent because the faeces can be pushed around. That sounds plausible. I think this is true.

Option B: A non-tender mass is always indicative of a benign tumor. Wait, no. Non-tender masses can be many things. For example, some cancers might not cause pain, and other conditions like hernias or cysts can also be non-tender. So it's not always a benign tumor. This statement is probably false.

Option C: A hard mass is always a symptom of colorectal cancer. I'm not so sure. While colorectal cancer can present as a hard mass, especially if it's in the colon and hard due to the tumor, a hard mass isn't exclusive to cancer. Maybe something like a calcified area or other tumors could be hard too. So this isn't always the case. False.

Option D: An enlarged kidney is dull to percussion. I remember that the kidney's dullness is a standard percussion finding. So if the kidney is enlarged, like in nephromegaly, percussion would be dull. That sounds correct. So D is true.

Option E: A movable mass is a definite sign of a hernia. A hernia can cause a movable mass, but so can other things like a cyst or a lipoma. So it's not definite. It could be other things. So E is false.

Option F: A large mass arising out of the pelvis which disappears following urethral catheterization is caused by an ovarian cyst. Wait, when you catheterize the bladder, if the mass goes away, it might be due to a full bladder. But if the mass is in the pelvis and disappears after catheterization, it could be because the bladder was full, pushing something else down. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyst that's being drained. I'm not too sure. Maybe this is a trick. I'll come back to this.

Option G: A mass that changes size is always due to a bladder infection. Changing size masses could be due to various things, like a distended bladder or maybe an ovarian cyst that fluctuates with the menstrual cycle. Bladder infections (cystitis) might cause pain and frequency but not necessarily a mass that changes size. So G is probably false.

Option H: A mass that disappears after eating is caused by a stomach ulcer. I think after eating, the stomach expands, so if there's a mass, maybe it's due to the stomach being distended. But a stomach ulcer itself might not cause a mass that disappears after eating. Wait, maybe a perforated ulcer could cause a mass, but I'm not sure if disappearing after eating is a sign. I'm a bit confused here. Maybe H is false.

Option I: A pulsatile mass is always due to an aortic aneurysm. Well, an aortic aneurysm can cause a pulsatile mass, especially if it's in the abdomen. But other pulsatile masses could be due to other arteries or even cardiac issues in some cases. So it's not always an aortic aneurysm. So I is false.

Option J: A painful mass is always a symptom of gallstones. Gallstones can cause pain, especially during a gallbladder attack, but a painful mass isn't exclusive to gallstones. Other issues like appendicitis, kidney stones, or even hernias can cause painful masses. So J is false.

Wait, so looking back, options A and D seem correct. Let me double-check. 

Option A: Indentible mass due to faecal loading. Yes, that's correct because faeces can be pushed around, making the mass indentible. 

Option D: Enlarged kidney is dull to percussion. Yes, that's textbook.

Wait, but the question says "which of the following is true." So there might be more than one correct option, but in multiple-choice questions, usually, only one is correct. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are A through J, and the user says to select one. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, the correct answers are A and D? Or perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, no, in the options, each is a separate statement. So perhaps both A and D are correct, but the answer expects only one. Let me think again.

Wait, the question states "which of the following is true," so it's possible that more than one is correct, but in this case, the options are presented as single choices, so perhaps only one is correct. Let me see.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps I was wrong about D. Because when you percuss an enlarged kidney, it's dull, yes. For example, in renal enlargement, the dullness is a positive sign. So D is correct.

So, if both A and D are correct, but the options are presented as separate, perhaps the intended correct answer is D, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe only A is correct.

Wait, but in the initial analysis, I thought A is correct because faecal loading makes the mass indentible. So perhaps the correct answer is A and D. But since the options are A to J, perhaps the intended correct answer is D.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps only A is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D. Because in the options, I'm more confident about D being correct. Let me confirm.

Wait, in clinical practice, when you have an enlarged kidney, it's typically dull on percussion because the kidney is a solid organ. So when the kidney is enlarged, like in nephromegaly due to hydronephrosis or tumors, percussion over the area would be dull. So D is correct.

So, considering all this, the correct answers are A and D. But since the options are presented as separate, perhaps the correct answer is both A and D. But the way the question is phrased, "which of the following is true," so multiple could be correct, but the options are from A to J, each a separate statement.

Wait, perhaps only one is correct. Let me check the options again.

Looking back, perhaps I made a mistake with option F. If a mass in the pelvis disappears after catheterization, that might be due to a full bladder pressing on something, making the mass palpable when the bladder is full. So if the mass disappears when the bladder is emptied, it's likely due to bladder distension. So in that case, the mass isn't due to an ovarian cyst but rather the bladder. So F is incorrect.

Similarly, option H: a mass that disappears after eating. Maybe it's due to the stomach expanding, so the mass is from a distended stomach. So H is incorrect.

So, back to the options, the correct statements are A and D. But since the question is multiple-choice, perhaps the intended correct answer is D, as it's a more definitive statement.

Alternatively, perhaps only D is correct. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, the question says "which of the following is true," so I'll go with the options I think are correct. So, perhaps both A and D are correct. But since the options are separate, perhaps each is a separate true statement.

But let me look up some of these points to confirm.

Indentible mass: Yes, faecal loading can cause a soft, movable mass in the abdomen, so A is correct.

Enlarged kidney: Dull percussion, correct.

So both A and D are correct. But the options are presented as individual true statements. So perhaps the correct answer includes both, but the way the question is set up, perhaps only one is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the intended correct answer is D.

Wait, but looking at the options again, perhaps F is correct. If a mass in the pelvis disappears after catheterization, that's because the bladder was full and pressing on the ovaries or another structure, making the mass palpable when the bladder is full. So when you catheterize, the bladder empties, and the mass goes away. So that would suggest the mass wasn't the ovarian cyst but due to the bladder. So F is incorrect.

So, the correct answers are A and D.

But the question asks which is true, so perhaps both A and D are correct, but the options are presented as separate. So perhaps the intended correct answer is A and D. But since the user expects a single letter, perhaps the intended correct answer is D.

Wait, perhaps the intended correct answer is D, as it's a clear fact.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D: An enlarged kidney is dull to percussion. That's a standard finding.

So, after all that, I think the correct answer is D.

The correct answer is D: An enlarged kidney is dull to percussion.
