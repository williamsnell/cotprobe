Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty in energy due to the lifetime of an excited state. Hmm, I remember from my studies that this has something to do with quantum mechanics and the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Let me think.

The problem says the lifetime of the excited state is 10^-9 seconds, and we need to find the uncertainty in energy. I think the formula involves the uncertainty principle, which relates the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) to the uncertainty in time (Δt). Oh right, the formula is ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

Wait, no, wait. I think it's actually ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, but sometimes people use the approximation without the 1/2 factor, so maybe just ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt. I should check that. Oh, right, the uncertainty principle is often written as ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2, but for order-of-magnitude estimates, people often ignore the 1/2 factor. So I'll go with ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.

So, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. What's the value of ħ? I think it's approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. Yeah, that's right.

So plugging in the numbers, ΔE = ħ / Δt. Δt is 10^-9 seconds. Let me calculate that.

So ħ is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Dividing that by 1e-9 s gives me 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.0545718e-25 J.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest option is E:5e-25 J, but that's not matching exactly. Hmm, did I make a mistake? Wait, wait, wait. Maybe I should include the factor of π or something else? Or perhaps I was wrong about the formula. Let me think again.

Oh wait, sometimes the formula is given as ΔE ≈ ħω, where ω is the angular frequency. But no, that's not directly relevant here. Alternatively, another thought: the energy-time uncertainty principle is ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So using Δt = 1e-9 s, then ΔE ≥ ħ/(2Δt). So maybe I should use ħ/(2Δt).

Let me recalculate with that. ħ is 1.05457e-34 J·s. Divided by 2 gives 5.27288e-35 J·s. Then divided by Δt=1e-9 s: 5.27288e-35 / 1e-9 = 5.27288e-26 J. Wait, that's even smaller than before. But the options are in 1e-25 J range. Hmm, that's not matching any of the options. Did I get the formula wrong?

Wait, perhaps the formula is actually ΔE ≈ ħ / (2Δt), which would make it 1.05457e-34 / (2*1e-9) = 1.05457e-34 / 2e-9 = 5.2728e-26 J. Still way smaller than the options. But the options start at 1e-25, which is an order of magnitude larger than that.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the exponent. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, ħ is 1.05457e-34 J·s. So dividing by 1e-9 s: 1.05457e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.05457e-25 J. So that's approximately 1e-25 J. Looking at the options, J is 1e-25, but the answer is option J. But wait, the options don't have 1.05e-25, but they do have option J as 1e-25. So that would be the correct choice. But wait, wait, let's think again about the formula.

I think I was confused earlier. The correct formula is ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt. So using ħ ≈ 1e-34 J·s, and Δt = 1e-9 s, so 1e-34 / 1e-9 = 1e-25 J. So the approximate uncertainty in energy is 1e-25 J. Looking at the options, option J is 1e-25 J. So that should be the answer. Wait, but some sources might include a factor like π or 2, but for the uncertainty principle, the exact factor isn't critical; it's more about the order of magnitude.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes the formula is written as ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt), which would make it approximately 0.527e-25 J, which is about 5.27e-26 J, but that's not matching any of the options either. Wait, none of the options are that small. So perhaps the correct formula is ΔE ≈ ħ/(Δt), leading to 1e-25 J. So the answer should be option J.

But wait, looking at the options: option J is 1e-25, but option E is 5e-25. Did I miscalculate the ħ value? Let me check: ħ is approximately 1.05457e-34 J·s. So 1.05457e-34 divided by 1e-9 is 1.05457e-25 J. So that's about 1.05e-25 J, which is closest to option J (1e-25) or option E (5e-25). But 1.05 is closer to 1. So I think the intended answer is J: 1e-25 J.

The uncertainty in energy can be calculated using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) to the uncertainty in time (Δt) as ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant (approximately 1.0545718 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s). Given Δt = 10⁻⁹ s, ΔE = 1.0545718 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s / 10⁻⁹ s ≈ 1.05 × 10⁻²⁵ J. Among the options, the closest match is J: 1 × 10⁻²⁵ J.
