Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the magnetic field in an air-core toroid. Hmm, I remember that a toroid is like a doughnut-shaped coil, right? And it's used to create a magnetic field that's mostly contained within the core, which in this case is air. 

The problem gives me some parameters: 500 turns, a cross-sectional area of 6 cm², a mean radius of 15 cm, and a coil current of 4A. I need to find the magnetic field using flux densities and then check it using Ampere's law. 

Wait, flux density... Oh right, flux density is another term for B, the magnetic field. So I'm looking for B here. 

I think the formula for the magnetic field inside a toroid is something like B = (μ₀ * N * I) / (2πr), where μ₀ is the permeability of free space, N is the number of turns, I is the current, and r is the mean radius. Alternatively, I've also heard it expressed as B = (μ₀ * N * I) / (r), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the formula I remember is B = (μ₀ * N * I) divided by (2π times the mean radius R). So the correct formula is B = (μ₀ * N * I) / (2π R). 

Let me double-check that. Oh right, because the toroid's shape is circular, and the formula comes from Ampere's law applied to the toroidal path. Ampere's law says that the integral of B·dl around a closed loop is μ₀ times the enclosed current. For a toroid, the loop is circular, and B is constant along the loop, so B * 2πR = μ₀ * N * I. That gives B = (μ₀ N I) / (2π R). Yep, that makes sense.

So now plugging in the numbers:

μ₀ is 4π × 10^-7 T·m/A. N is 500 turns, I is 4A, R is 15 cm which is 0.15 meters.

So let's compute this step by step.

First, calculate the numerator: μ₀ * N * I = (4π × 10^-7) * 500 * 4.

Let me compute that: 4π × 10^-7 is approximately 1.2566 × 10^-6. But maybe I'll keep it symbolic for now.

So 4π × 10^-7 * 500 = 4π * 500 * 10^-7 = (2000π) * 10^-7 = 2π × 10^-4. Then multiply by I=4: 2π × 10^-4 *4 = 8π × 10^-4.

Now the denominator is 2π R. R is 0.15 m, so 2π * 0.15 = 0.3π.

So B = (8π × 10^-4) / (0.3π) = (8 × 10^-4) / 0.3.

The π cancels out, which is good. So 8e-4 divided by 0.3.

Let me compute that: 8e-4 is 0.0008. Divided by 0.3 is the same as 0.0008 / 0.3. Let me do the division: 0.0008 ÷ 0.3 = 0.002666... That's approximately 2.666... × 10^-3, but wait, wait, that can't be right because the options don't have such a small number. Oh wait, no, wait, maybe I messed up the calculation.

Wait, no, wait. Let me recalculate that. Wait, 8e-4 is 0.0008. Divided by 0.3 is 0.002666..., which is 2.666... × 10^-3 T. Wait, but that would be 2.666e-3 Tesla. Hmm, but looking at the options, they are in the range of thousands or millions.

Wait, something's wrong here because 2.6e-3 T is 2600 Gauss, which is a reasonable value for a toroid, but looking at the options, option C is 1500 A-T/m, which seems too low, and option D is 4400, which is higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the formula might be different. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula B = (μ₀ * N * I) / (2π R). Let me recalculate.

μ₀ = 4π × 10^-7 T·m/A.

So μ₀ * N * I = 4π × 10^-7 * 500 * 4.

Compute 500 *4 = 2000. So 4π × 10^-7 * 2000 = (4 *2000) π ×10^-7 = 8000 π ×10^-7 = 8 π × 10^-4.

Then divide by (2π R)=2π *0.15=0.3π.

So B = (8 π ×10^-4) / (0.3 π) = (8 ×10^-4) / 0.3 = 8/(0.3) ×10^-4 = 26.666... ×10^-4 T.

Wait, 8 /0.3 is approximately 26.666..., so 26.666e-4 is 0.002666 T, which is 2.666e-3 T, which is about 2666 Gauss. Wait, but 1 Tesla is 10^4 Gauss, so 0.002666 T is 26.66 Gauss. Wait, that seems low. Wait, but I'm getting confused because the options are in A-T/m, which is Tesla per meter? No, wait, no, wait, wait! Oh no, wait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding the units.

Wait, the options are in A-T/m. Wait, A-T/m is Ampere-turns per meter? Or is it Tesla per meter? Hmm, no, wait, flux density B is measured in Tesla (T). So the options must have a typo, perhaps, or I'm misinterpreting. Wait, looking back at the question, it says "find the magnetic field of the toroidal coil using flux densities and check by Ampere's law." So the magnetic field B is in Tesla, so the options must have a mistake, or perhaps it's a typo and the units are Tesla, but the options are written as A-T/m, which is unclear. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mistake in the question, and the units are Tesla.

Wait, but looking at the options, for example, option B is 1250 A-T/m. If I'm getting about 2.666e-3 T, that's 2.666e-3 Tesla. But 2.666e-3 is 2.666 milliTesla, which is 2666 mT. Wait, but that's 2.666e-3 T, which is 2.666 ×10^-3 T. None of the options match this, except perhaps option J is 1.6e-6, which is much smaller, and options like D is 4400, which would be 4.4 T, which is high.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another approach: The formula for B in a toroid is B = (μ₀ * N * I) / (2π R), where R is the mean radius. Let me check the formula again. Alternatively, sometimes the formula is written as B = (μ₀ * N * I) / (r), but that would be if r is the radius, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, that can't be right because the units wouldn't match. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the current per unit length or something else. Alternatively, maybe the cross-sectional area is given, but it's not needed here because the formula for B in a toroid depends only on the number of turns, current, and radius. The cross-sectional area might be relevant if we were calculating the inductance, but for B, it's not needed.

Wait, but let me double-check the formula from another angle. Ampere's law: ∮ B · dl = μ₀ I_enc. For a toroid, the path is a circle of radius r (same as R, the mean radius), and B is uniform around the loop. So B * 2π r = μ₀ * N * I. So B = (μ₀ * N * I) / (2π r). Yes, that's correct.

So plugging in the numbers again:

μ₀ = 4π ×1e-7 T·m/A.

N = 500 turns.

I = 4 A.

r = 0.15 m.

So B = (4πe-7 * 500 *4) / (2π *0.15).

Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 4πe-7 *500*4 = 4πe-7 *2000 = 8000πe-7 = 8πe-4.

Denominator: 2π *0.15 = 0.3π.

So B = (8πe-4) / (0.3π) = (8e-4)/(0.3) = approximately 0.002666... T, which is 2.666...e-3 T.

Wait, that's about 2.67e-3 T, which is 2670 Gauss. Looking at the options, I don't see anything close to that. The closest is option I: 2120 A-T/m, but that's in A-T/m, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: sometimes the formula is written as B = (μ₀ * N * I) / (r), without the 2π. Did I get that wrong? Let me check. No, because Ampere's law says the integral around the loop is μ₀ I_enc. For a loop of radius r, the circumference is 2π r, so B * 2π r = μ₀ N I. So B = (μ₀ N I) / (2π r). So my initial calculation was correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute the numerator and denominator again.

μ₀ =4π ×1e-7 = 4πe-7.

N=500, I=4.

So μ₀*N*I =4πe-7 *500*4.

500 *4 =2000.

So 4πe-7 *2000 = 8000πe-7 = 8πe-4.

Denominator: 2π *0.15 =0.3π.

So B=8πe-4 /0.3π =8e-4 /0.3 = approx 0.002666 T.

That's 2.666e-3 T, which is 2666 Gauss.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let me look again at the options:

A: 1.9 ×10^-6 A-T/m

B:1,250 A-T/m

C:1,500 A-T/m

D:4,400 A-T/m

E:850 A-T/m

F:2,000 A-T/m

G:2,700 A-T/m

H:3,200 A-T/m

I:2,120 A-T/m

J:1.6 ×10^-6 A-T/m

Hmm, none of these are close to 2.6e-3 T. Wait, perhaps the units in the options are Tesla, but written as A-T/m by mistake. Alternatively, maybe I got the formula wrong and it's actually B = μ₀ N I / (r), without the 2π.

Wait, if I do that, B= (4πe-7 *500*4)/(0.15).

Compute numerator:4πe-7*2000=8000πe-7=8πe-4.

Divide by 0.15: 8πe-4 /0.15.

8π is about 25.1327, so 25.1327e-4 /0.15 = (25.1327 /0.15) *1e-4 = approx 167.551 *1e-4= 0.016755 T, which is 16.755 mT, still not matching any options.

Hmm, that's not matching either. Alternatively, perhaps I should be using the cross-sectional area in some way. Wait, but in the formula for B in a toroid, the cross-sectional area doesn't directly come into play because B depends only on the number of turns, current, and the mean radius. So maybe the cross-sectional area is a red herring here, unless the problem is asking for something else, like inductance.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I'm supposed to compute the flux density in the core, but since it's an air-core, μ_r is 1, so μ=μ₀. But that shouldn't change the result.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in converting cm to meters. The radius is 15 cm, which is 0.15 m, correct. The cross-sectional area is 6 cm², which is 6e-4 m², but that's not needed for B, so perhaps that's irrelevant here.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the magnetic field in terms of Ampere-turns per meter, which is a unit sometimes used. Wait, Ampere-turns per meter (A·turn/m) is equivalent to Tesla (T), because 1 T = 1 A·turn/m. So if the options are in A-T/m, that's the same as Tesla. So perhaps the options are in Tesla, written as A-T/m, which is a bit confusing.

So looking at the options again:

Option I is 2120 A-T/m, which would be 2120 T, which is way too high. But my calculation gives about 2.666e-3 T, which is 0.002666 T. None of the options match that. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I misread the number of turns. The problem says 500 turns. Yes, that's correct. Current is 4 A. Radius is 15 cm, which is 0.15 m.

Wait, let me try another approach. Maybe the formula is B = (μ₀ * N * I) / (r), without the 2π. Let's try that.

So B = (4πe-7 *500 *4) /0.15.

Compute numerator:4πe-7 *2000 =8000πe-7 =8πe-4.

Divide by 0.15: 8πe-4 /0.15 ≈ (25.1327e-4)/0.15 ≈ 0.00251327 /0.15 ≈ 0.016755 T, which is 16.755 mT. Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the mean radius correctly, but I'm mixing up mean radius and other parameters. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is B = (μ₀ * N * I) / (2π R), where R is the mean radius.

Wait, let me recompute using exact values without approximations.

B = (4π ×1e-7 T·m/A * 500 turns *4 A) / (2π * 0.15 m).

Simplify numerator: 4π *500*4 = 4*500*4 *π = 8000π.

Denominator: 2π *0.15 = 0.3π.

So B = (8000π ×1e-7) / (0.3π) = (8000e-7) /0.3.

8000e-7 is 8e-4. 8e-4 /0.3 = (8/0.3) ×1e-4 = approx 26.6667 ×1e-4 = 2.6667e-3 T.

Which is 2.6667e-3 T, or 0.0026667 T.

Looking at the options again, none of them are close to this. So maybe I'm miscalculating, or perhaps the question expects a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the total flux, not the field. Or perhaps it's using the cross-sectional area to compute something else. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to calculate the flux density in the core, but that shouldn't change much because it's air.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is using the area in some way. Let me think again. The formula for B in a toroid is indeed B = (μ₀ N I) / (2π R). So unless there's another factor, like the number of turns per unit length, but that's already accounted for in N, I think.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is asking for the magnetic field in terms of Ampere-turns per meter, which is μ₀ times the current density. Wait, no, that's not right. Ampere-turns per meter is the same as Tesla, because B = μ₀ J, where J is current density in A/m², but that's not directly applicable here.

Wait, maybe the problem is using the term 'flux density' incorrectly, and they're asking for the total flux instead of B. But flux is in Weber, and that's not what the options are showing.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula used is B = μ₀ N I / r, but with r in centimeters, so let's try that.

If I use r = 15 cm, which is 0.15 m, same as before. So same calculation as before, which gives 2.666e-3 T. Not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me check another source. Oh, wait, perhaps the formula is B = (μ₀ N I) / (2π r), which I've been using. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the current is 4A per turn, so total current is 4 *500 =2000 A? No, no, the current I is per turn. So I=4A for each of the 500 turns. So that's correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the mean radius in centimeters instead of converting to meters. Let me try that. R =15 cm =0.15 m, which I've been using. If I mistakenly used 15 instead of 0.15, that would change things. Let's see.

If I mistakenly used R=15 m, which is 1500 cm, then B would be (4πe-7 *500*4)/(2π *15) = (8000πe-7)/(30π) )=8000e-7/30 =8e-4/30 ≈2.666e-5 T, which is even smaller, not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used R in centimeters without converting to meters. Let me see: R=15 cm =0.15 m. So that's correct. If I mistakenly used 15 cm as 15 instead of 0.15, then the calculation would be wrong.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in Tesla, and the options have a typo, listing them as A-T/m instead of Tesla. So option I is 2120 A-T/m, which would be 2120 T, which is way too high. Option B is 1250 A-T/m, which is 1250 T, also way too high.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 8e-4 divided by 0.3 exactly.

8e-4 is 0.0008.

0.0008 divided by 0.3 equals 0.002666..., which is 2.666... ×10^-3 T.

Hmm, but the options don't have anything close to that. Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the flux density in the core, but that's what I did. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for a straight solenoid instead of a toroid, which would give a different result.

Wait, the formula for a solenoid is B = μ₀ N I / L, where L is length. But that's different from a toroid. Let me see what that would give.

If I mistakenly used the solenoid formula, B = μ₀ N I / L, but I don't have the length of the solenoid, so that's not applicable here. So I think the correct approach is the toroid formula.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for something else, like the magnetic field at the center of the coil, but that's not the case for a toroid. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the cross-sectional area to compute the number of turns per unit length, which is (N/A), but I'm not sure.

Wait, the number of turns per unit length (n) is N/(2π R), because the circumference is 2π R, and if the cross-sectional area is A, then the number of turns per unit length would be N/(2π R * (A/ something)). Hmm, perhaps not relevant here.

Wait, maybe I should compute the flux density in the core using flux density B = (μ₀ N I) / (2π R), which I did, and that gives 0.002666 T, but that's not matching any options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is B = (μ₀ N I) / (r), without the 2π. Let me try that.

So B = (4πe-7 *500*4)/0.15.

Compute numerator:4πe-7 *2000 =8000πe-7=8πe-4.

Divide by 0.15: 8πe-4 /0.15 = approx 8*3.1416e-4 /0.15 ≈25.1328e-4 /0.15 ≈0.0016755 T, which is about 1.6755 mT. Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should check the units again. The options are in A-T/m, which is Ampere-turns per meter. Wait, Ampere-turns per meter is equivalent to Tesla, because 1 T = 1 Wb/m², and 1 Wb = 1 T·m², so 1 T = 1 Wb/m², but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the unit is Tesla.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the total magnetic flux in the toroid and then find the field. But the flux Φ = B * A, where A is the cross-sectional area. But that's not directly giving me B, so I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the induced EMF or something else, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the question is about finding the magnetic flux density in the core, which is the same as B, so that's what I calculated.

Wait, perhaps the formula is B = (μ₀ N I) / (2π R), which gives 2.666e-3 T, but none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute it again step by step.

μ₀ =4π ×1e-7 = 1.256637e-6 T·m/A.

N=500.

I=4 A.

R=0.15 m.

So B = (1.256637e-6 *500 *4) / (2π *0.15).

Compute numerator: 1.256637e-6 *2000 = 2.513274e-3.

Denominator: 2π *0.15 = 0.9424778.

So B = 2.513274e-3 /0.9424778 ≈ 2.666e-3 T.

Same result as before.

Hmm, I'm stuck. The calculation seems correct, but the options don't match. Maybe the problem expects the answer in a different unit. Let me see:

2.666e-3 T is 2666 Gauss. But the options are in A-T/m, which I think is a typo for Tesla. Looking at the options again:

Option I: 2,120 A-T/m. If that's Tesla, then 2120 T, which is way higher than my result. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in Gauss, but 2.666e-3 T is 2666 Gauss, which is 2.666e3 Gauss. None of the options match that either.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in converting cm to meters. Let me check: 15 cm is 0.15 m, correct. So that's right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula without the μ₀, but that would give a much larger value.

Wait, perhaps the formula is B = (N I) / (2π R), without μ₀. Let's try that.

B = (500 *4)/(2π *0.15) = 2000/(0.9424778) ≈2120.7 T.

Ah, that's approximately 2120 T, which matches option I: 2,120 A-T/m (assuming the unit is Tesla).

Wait, that makes sense now. So perhaps the problem forgot to include μ₀ in the formula, or perhaps I was supposed to assume that the core is not air but something else, but the problem says it's an air-core.

Wait, but the formula without μ₀ would be incorrect because the magnetic field depends on the permeability of the medium. For air, μ₀ is needed. So why am I getting a value that matches option I when I exclude μ₀?

Hmm, perhaps the question intended to use the formula without μ₀, which would give a much higher B, matching option I. But that would be incorrect because B is given by (μ₀ N I)/(2π R). So I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of μ₀ multiplied by something else. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula B = (N I) / (2π R), which would give 2120 T, matching option I. But that's not correct because μ₀ is missing. So why would that be the case?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for a long coil instead of a toroid, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me check again.

If I calculate without μ₀:

B = (500 *4)/(2π *0.15) =2000/(0.9424778)= approx 2120 T.

Which is exactly option I:2120 A-T/m.

So perhaps the problem expects the answer without μ₀, which would be incorrect, but that's what the options suggest.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different formula, like B = (N I)/(r), which would be (500*4)/0.15= 2000/0.15≈13333 T, which is not in the options.

Hmm.

Wait, given that the correct calculation with μ₀ gives 2.666e-3 T, which is not among the options, but the calculation without μ₀ gives 2120 T, which is option I, perhaps the problem expects the answer without μ₀, which would be incorrect. But since the options don't match the correct calculation, I'm forced to choose the closest option, which is option I:2120 A-T/m.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the correct formula is B = (μ₀ N I)/(r), without the 2π. Let me try that.

So B = (4πe-7 *500 *4)/0.15 = (8πe-4)/0.15 ≈ (25.1327e-4)/0.15 ≈0.0016755 T, which is about 1.6755 mT, still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is B = (μ₀ N I)/(2 R), which would be (4πe-7 *500 *4)/(2*0.15)= (8πe-4)/(0.3) = same as before, 2.666e-3 T.

No, that's the same as before.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. The correct calculation gives me about 2.666e-3 T, but none of the options match. The only option that comes close when I exclude μ₀ is option I:2120 A-T/m, which would be 2120 T if the units are Tesla. But that's way higher than my correct calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the magnetic field at the center of a circular loop, which is B = (μ₀ N I)/(2 R), but that's for a single loop, not a toroid. Let me try that.

B = (4πe-7 *500 *4)/(2*0.15) = (8000πe-7)/(0.3) = same as before, 2.666e-3 T.

Still the same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for a long solenoid, where B = μ₀ N I / L, but I don't have the length L. Alternatively, perhaps the number of turns per unit length (n) is N/(2π R), which would be 500/(2π *0.15) ≈500/0.942≈530.5 turns per meter.

Then B = μ₀ n I =4πe-7 *530.5 *4 ≈4πe-7 *2122 ≈8.57e-4 T, which is still around 0.000857 T, which is 857 μT, not matching any options.

Wait, looking at the options, option E is 850 A-T/m, which would be 850 T if the units are Tesla. Hmm, but that's not matching either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the field in a toroid but in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps the cross-sectional area is needed to compute the total flux, but that's not required for B.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the formula for the magnetic field in a toroid as B = (μ₀ N I) / (2π R), which is correct, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me compute it again with exact numbers.

μ₀ =4π ×1e-7 = 1.2566370614e-6 T·m/A.

N=500.

I=4.

R=0.15 m.

So B = (1.2566370614e-6 *500 *4)/(2π *0.15).

Compute numerator: 1.2566370614e-6 *2000 = 2.5132741228e-3.

Denominator: 2π *0.15 = 0.9424777961.

So B = 2.5132741228e-3 / 0.9424777961 ≈ 2.666666666e-3 T.

So, 2.666666666e-3 T is 0.002666666666 T.

Looking at the options, none match. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but since I have to choose from the options, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula without the μ₀, giving 2120 T, which is option I. So maybe I should choose option I.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check a reference.

Upon checking, the formula for B inside a toroid is indeed B = (μ₀ N I)/(2π R). So my calculation is correct. Therefore, the correct answer should be approximately 2.666e-3 T, but it's not listed. So perhaps the options are incorrect, or I misread the problem.

Wait, looking back, the problem says "air-core toroid", so μ=μ₀. So my calculation should be correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in Gauss instead of Tesla. 2.666e-3 T is 2666 Gauss. The options are in A-T/m, which I think is a typo for Tesla. So 2666 Gauss is 2.666 Tesla. But none of the options are close to that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of turns. The problem says 500 turns, correct. So I think I've done everything correctly.

In conclusion, the correct answer based on the formula is approximately 2.666e-3 T, but since it's not listed, I must have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to use a different formula, leading to option I:2120 A-T/m.

To determine the magnetic field \( B \) inside an air-core toroid, the formula derived from Ampere's law is:

\[
B = \frac{\mu_0 \cdot N \cdot I}{2\pi R}
\]

Where:
- \( \mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \, \text{T·m/A} \) (permeability of free space),
- \( N = 500 \) (number of turns),
- \( I = 4 \, \text{A} \) (current),
- \( R = 0.15 \, \text{m} \) (mean radius).

### Step 1: Compute the numerator
\[
\mu_0 \cdot N \cdot I = (4\pi \times 10^{-7}) \cdot 500 \cdot 4 = 8\pi \times 10^{-4}
\]

### Step 2: Compute the denominator
\[
2\pi R = 2\pi \cdot 0.15 = 0.3\pi
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( B \)
\[
B = \frac{8\pi \times 10^{-4}}{0.3\pi} = \frac{8 \times 10^{-4}}{0.3} \approx 2.666 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{T}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with options
The calculated \( B \) is approximately \( 2.666 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{T} \), which is \( 2.666 \, \text{mT} \). However, none of the options match this value. The closest match, assuming a potential error in the problem setup or units, is **Option I: 2,120 A-T/m**, which corresponds to \( 2120 \, \text{T} \) if the units are interpreted as Tesla. This discrepancy suggests the problem may have omitted \( \mu_0 \) in the formula, leading to a much higher value.

### Conclusion
While the correct calculation yields \( 2.666 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{T} \), the only plausible choice from the given options is:

**I: 2,120 A-T/m**
