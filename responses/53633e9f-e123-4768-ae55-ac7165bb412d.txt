Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this economics question about comparative advantage. Let me read it again carefully.

Ray and Dorothy can both cook and pull weeds. On a Saturday afternoon, they have to decide what to do. The question says that for every hour of cooking, Ray can pull 50 weeds, and Dorothy can pull 100 weeds. Hmm, I think I need to break this down.

Wait, so when it says "for every hour of cooking," does that mean that while cooking, they can also pull weeds? Or does it mean that for each hour they spend cooking, they can pull X weeds during that same hour? I think it's the latter. So, their opportunity cost is the number of weeds they can pull while they're cooking. Or maybe it's the other way aroundâ€”how much they can cook while pulling weeds? No, I think the question is saying that if they spend an hour cooking, during that same hour, Ray can pull 50 weeds, and Dorothy can pull 100. Or perhaps it's the weeds they can pull per hour of cooking time. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Let me think again. If Ray spends an hour cooking, he can pull 50 weeds during that time. Similarly, Dorothy can pull 100 weeds in an hour of cooking. So, their weed-pulling rate is 50 and 100 per hour of cooking, respectively. Alternatively, maybe it's about their opportunity cost: the weeds they give up when they choose to cook instead of pull weeds. Or perhaps it's their productivity rates when doing each task.

Wait, maybe I should model this as their opportunity costs. Let's assume that if Ray spends an hour cooking, he could have pulled 50 weeds instead. Similarly, Dorothy, if she cooks for an hour, could have pulled 100 weeds. So, the opportunity cost of cooking for Ray is 50 weeds, and for Dorothy, it's 100 weeds.

Comparative advantage is about who has a lower opportunity cost in producing a good. So, the person who can produce more of one good with their time has a comparative advantage in that good.

Wait, but in this case, both can cook and pull weeds. So, perhaps we're looking at which task each is better at relative to the other.

Let me think about the possible options. The question is asking which option correctly identifies who should do which task based on comparative advantage.

Option A says Ray cooks because he has an absolute advantage in pulling weeds. Wait, but Ray can only pull 50 weeds per hour of cooking, while Dorothy can pull 100. So, Dorothy has a higher absolute advantage in pulling weeds. So, if the question is about absolute advantage, Dorothy is better at pulling weeds. But the options involve comparative advantage, I think.

Option B: Ray pulls weeds since he has comparative advantage in pulling. Hmm, but if Ray's opportunity cost of cooking is 50 weeds, and Dorothy's is 100 weeds, then Ray has a lower opportunity cost in cooking, meaning he should specialize in cooking, allowing Dorothy to specialize in pulling weeds, where she has a lower opportunity cost (since her opportunity cost of cooking is 100 weeds, which is higher than Ray's 50). Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I should calculate their opportunity costs. Let's assume that the time they spend on one activity determines how much of the other they can do. So, if Ray spends an hour cooking, he can pull 50 weeds. So, the opportunity cost of cooking for Ray is 50 weeds. Alternatively, the opportunity cost of pulling weeds for Ray is 1/50 hours of cooking per weed. Similarly, Dorothy's opportunity cost of cooking is 100 weeds, so she gives up 100 weeds per hour of cooking.

Comparative advantage is determined by who has a lower opportunity cost for a particular task. So, for cooking, Ray's opportunity cost is 50 weeds, and Dorothy's is 100. So, Ray has a lower opportunity cost for cooking, meaning he should specialize in cooking, and Dorothy should specialize in pulling weeds, where her opportunity cost is lower.

So, in this case, Ray should cook, and Dorothy should pull weeds. Let me look at the options:

Option C: Ray cooks, since he has comparative advantage in cooking. That sounds correct because Ray's opportunity cost of cooking is lower than Dorothy's.

Option D: Dorothy pulls weeds, since she has comparative advantage in pulling. That's also correct because her opportunity cost of cooking is higher, so she's better off pulling weeds.

Wait, but the options need to be paired. The question is about who should do what. So, the correct answer would be that Ray cooks, and Dorothy pulls weeds, which would be option C and D perhaps, but looking at the options, each is a separate choice.

Looking back, the options are A to J. Let me check each:

A: Ray cooks, absolute advantage in pulling weeds. But Ray doesn't have absolute advantage in pulling; Dorothy does. So A is wrong.

B: Ray pulls weeds, comparative advantage. But Ray's opportunity cost is lower in cooking, so he should cook. So B is wrong.

C: Ray cooks, comparative advantage in cooking. Correct, because Ray's opportunity cost is lower in cooking.

D: Dorothy pulls weeds, comparative advantage. Also correct, as her opportunity cost is higher in cooking, so she has a comparative advantage in pulling.

But the options are single choices, so which one is correct?

Wait, the question is about what they should do. So, the correct pair is Ray cooks, Dorothy pulls. So, looking at the options, option C says Ray cooks because of comparative advantage in cooking, which is correct.

Option J: Dorothy cooks, comparative advantage in cooking. No, because her opportunity cost of cooking is higher than Ray's. So she's worse at cooking relative to pulling.

Alternatively, option D says Dorothy pulls because she has comparative advantage in pulling. That's also correct, as her opportunity cost of pulling is lower than Ray's. Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled.

Wait, perhaps I should model this with opportunity costs.

Ray's opportunity cost of 1 hour of cooking = 50 weeds.

Dorothy's opportunity cost of 1 hour of cooking = 100 weeds.

So, for cooking, Ray's OC is 50 weeds, Dorothy's OC is 100. So, Ray has a lower OC for cooking, meaning he should specialize in cooking. Dorothy, having a higher OC for cooking, should specialize in pulling weeds.

So, when comparing who should do what, the correct answer is that Ray cooks, and Dorothy pulls weeds.

Looking at the options, option C says Ray cooks because he has comparative advantage in cooking. That's correct.

Option D says Dorothy pulls because she has comparative advantage in pulling. Also correct, but the options are individual, so the correct answer would be either C or D. But in the context of the question, it's about what they should do. So, the correct answer would be that Ray cooks, and Dorothy pulls, which is option C and D respectively, but the options are separate.

Wait, the options are single statements, so the correct one would be C or D.

But let me think again. The question is asking based on the given information, so the answer should be either C or J, perhaps.

Wait, another approach: Let's calculate the opportunity cost per weed.

For Ray:

If he spends an hour cooking, he can pull 50 weeds. So, the opportunity cost of cooking is 50 weeds. Alternatively, the opportunity cost of pulling one weed is 1/50 hours of cooking.

For Dorothy:

She can pull 100 weeds in an hour of cooking. So, OC of cooking is 100 weeds. OC of pulling one weed is 1/100 hours of cooking.

Comparative advantage is determined by who has a lower opportunity cost in producing a good. So, for cooking, Ray's OC is 50 weeds per hour, Dorothy's is 100. So, Ray is more efficient at cooking (lower OC), so he should cook. Dorothy, having higher OC for cooking, should pull weeds.

So, Ray should cook, and Dorothy should pull weeds. Therefore, the correct answer is that Ray cooks because he has a comparative advantage in cooking, which is option C.

Alternatively, another way: the person with the lower opportunity cost for a task should specialize in that task. So, Ray has lower OC for cooking, so he should do cooking. Dorothy, with lower OC for pulling (since her OC for cooking is higher), should pull weeds.

So, the correct answer is option C: Ray cooks, since he has comparative advantage in cooking.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option J says Dorothy cooks because she has comparative advantage in cooking. That can't be right because her OC for cooking is higher. So, J is incorrect.

So, the answer should be C.
</think>

Ray and Dorothy can both cook and pull weeds. For every hour of cooking, Ray can pull 50 weeds, and Dorothy can pull 100 weeds. To determine who should do what, we analyze their opportunity costs. Ray's opportunity cost of cooking is 50 weeds, while Dorothy's is 100 weeds. Since Ray has a lower opportunity cost for cooking, he should specialize in cooking, while Dorothy, with a higher opportunity cost for cooking, should specialize in pulling weeds. Therefore, the correct answer is that Ray cooks because he has a comparative advantage in cooking.
