Okay, I need to solve this system of equations using Cramer's Rule. The equations are:

1. 2x + 3y + z = 8
2. 4x + 4y + 4z = 12
3. x + y + 8z = 10

Hmm, Cramer's Rule involves determinants, right? So first, I should write the system in matrix form Ax = b, where A is the coefficient matrix, x is the vector of variables, and b is the constants vector.

So the coefficient matrix A is:

| 2   3   1 |
| 4   4   4 |
| 1   1   8 |

And the constants vector b is [8, 12, 10]^T.

Cramer's Rule says that each variable x, y, z can be found by replacing the corresponding column in A with the vector b, then taking the determinant of that new matrix divided by the determinant of A.

First, I need to compute the determinant of A. Let's call it D.

D = det(A) = 2*(4*8 - 4*1) - 3*(4*8 - 4*1) + 1*(4*1 - 4*1)

Wait, that might be a bit confusing. Let me compute it step by step.

Calculating the determinant of A using the first row:

= 2 * det(minor of 2) - 3 * det(minor of 3) + 1 * det(minor of 1)

Minor of 2 is:
|4 4|
|1 8| → determinant is (4*8) - (4*1) = 32 - 4 = 28

Minor of 3 is:
|4 4|
|1 8| → same as above, determinant is 28

Minor of 1 is:
|4 4|
|1 1| → determinant is (4*1) - (4*1) = 4 - 4 = 0

So D = 2*(28) - 3*(28) + 1*(0) = 56 - 84 + 0 = -28

Wait, that can't be right. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the minors. Let me double-check.

Wait, the minor for the first element (2) is the determinant of the submatrix after removing row 1 and column 1:

|4 4|
|1 8| → 4*8 - 4*1 = 32 -4=28

For the second element (3), remove row 1 and column 2:

|4 4|
|1 8| → same as above, 28.

Wait no, wait. Wait, when you remove column 2, the submatrix for the second element (3) would be:

Row 2: 4, 4, 4 → remove column 2, so [4,4]
Row 3: 1, 1, 8 → remove column 2, so [1,8]

So the minor matrix is:

|4 4|
|1 8| → determinant 28.

Similarly, for the third element (1), remove column 3:

Row 2: 4,4,4 → remove column 3, so [4,4]
Row 3:1,1,8 → remove column 3, so [1,1]

So minor matrix is:

|4 4|
|1 1| → determinant is 4*1 -4*1= 4-4=0.

So D = 2*28 -3*28 +1*0 = 56 -84 +0 = -28.

Okay, so D = -28. Now, I need to compute Dx, Dy, Dz.

Dx is the determinant of the matrix formed by replacing the first column (x's coefficients) with the constants vector b.

So Dx's matrix is:

|8 3 1|
|12 4 4|
|10 1 8|

Compute Dx:

=8*(4*8 -4*1) -3*(12*8 -4*10) +1*(12*1 -4*10)

Compute each part:

First term: 8*(32 -4) =8*28=224

Second term: -3*(96 -40) =-3*(56) =-168

Third term: 1*(12 -40)=1*(-28)=-28

So Dx = 224 -168 -28 = 28

Dy is the determinant of the matrix formed by replacing the second column (y's coefficients) with b.

So Dy's matrix:

|2 8 1|
|4 12 4|
|1 10 8|

Compute Dy:

=2*(12*8 -4*10) -8*(4*8 -4*1) +1*(4*10 -12*1)

First term: 2*(96 -40)=2*(56)=112

Second term: -8*(32 -4)= -8*(28)= -224

Third term: 1*(40 -12)=1*28=28

So Dy =112 -224 +28 = (112+28) -224=140-224= -84

Dz is the determinant of the matrix formed by replacing the third column (z's coefficients) with b.

So Dz's matrix:

|2 3 8|
|4 4 12|
|1 1 10|

Compute Dz:

=2*(4*10 -12*1) -3*(4*10 -12*1) +8*(4*1 -4*1)

Wait, let me compute each term:

First term: 2*(40 -12)=2*28=56

Second term: -3*(40 -12)= -3*28= -84

Third term: 8*(4 -4)=8*0=0

So Dz=56 -84 +0= -28

Now, according to Cramer's Rule:

x = Dx / D = 28 / (-28) = -1

y = Dy / D = (-84)/(-28)=3

z = Dz / D = (-28)/(-28)=1

So the solution is x=-1, y=3, z=1.

Looking at the options, option D is [-1,3,1], which matches.

The solution using Cramer's Rule is x = -1, y = 3, z = 1.
