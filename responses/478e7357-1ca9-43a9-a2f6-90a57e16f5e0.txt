Question:

A landlord was the owner of a vacant warehouse. On May 1, the landlord leased the warehouse to the tenant for a term of five years with a renewable option. The leasehold agreement provided in part:"The tenant hereby acknowledges that certain areas of the leased premises are in a state of disrepair and unsafe for the conduct of business. Nonetheless, the tenant agrees to assume full responsibility for the necessary repairs. Furthermore, the tenant agrees to indemnify the landlord for any loss resulting from the condition of the said premises. "Under the terms of the lease, the landlord delivered possession of the warehouse to the tenant on May 2. On that date, an employee of the tenant was working in the warehouse. He was moving some equipment into the warehouse when a section of the ceiling collapsed and fell on him. At the time the landlord and the tenant entered into their lease, only the landlord was aware that the ceiling was defective and needed to be repaired. Although the landlord could have remedied the defect before delivering possession to the tenant, the landlord didn't perform any repair work on the ceiling. The employee initiated suit against the landlord to recover damages resulting from his injury. There are no applicable statutes. If the employee prevails it will be because a

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the right answer to this legal question. Let me read through the problem again and break it down.

So, the situation is about a landlord leasing a warehouse to a tenant. The lease agreement says that the tenant acknowledges some areas are in disrepair and unsafe, but the tenant agrees to fix them and indemnify the landlord for any losses. The landlord knew about the defective ceiling but didn't fix it before giving possession on May 2. Then, an employee gets injured when the ceiling collapses. The employee is suing the landlord.

The question is why the employee would win if he does. The options are from A to J. I need to figure out which legal principle applies here.

First, I remember that in landlord-tenant law, there's the concept of implied warranties. For commercial properties, there's usually an implied warranty of habitability. The landlord is required to provide a premises that's fit for its intended use, even if not expressly stated in the lease. So, if the landlord knows about a dangerous defect, like a falling ceiling, and doesn't fix it, the landlord might be liable even if the lease says the tenant will handle repairs.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the landlord's duty of care can't be shifted by the lease terms. That makes sense because some duties are non-delegable. Even if the lease says the tenant takes responsibility, the landlord might still be liable for their own negligence.

Option B suggests the tenant is responsible once possession is transferred. But I think the landlord can't just pass off all responsibilities, especially for hidden dangers they know about.

Option C is about waiving the implied warranty. I think the lease can't waive the implied warranty of habitability because it's for the protection of the tenant and can't be taken away easily.

Option D says the landlord is off the hook after signing the lease. That doesn't sound right because the landlord's duty might continue if they know about dangers.

Option E says the landlord's failure to repair isn't relevant. But the landlord knew about the defect and didn't fix it, so that should be relevant.

Option F says the indemnity covenant is against public policy. I'm not sure about this. Indemnity clauses are common, but maybe if it's trying to avoid liability for the landlord's own negligence, it could be against public policy.

Option G says the employee isn't protected. But the lease is between landlord and tenant, and the employee is the tenant's worker, so maybe the landlord isn't liable to the employee. But I'm not sure.

Option H talks about strict liability. I think landlord liability is usually based on negligence, not strict liability, unless there's something specific like abnormally dangerous conditions.

Option I says the duty can be transferred, but I think some duties can't be shifted, like the landlord's duty to ensure safety against their own negligence.

Option J says the tenant's acknowledgment absolves the landlord. But if the landlord knew about the defect and didn't fix it, the tenant's acknowledgment might not be enough to relieve the landlord of liability.

So, focusing on the implied warranty of habitability and whether the lease can shift the duty. The lease says the tenant takes full responsibility for repairs and indemnifies the landlord. But the landlord knew about the defect and didn't fix it before the lease started. 

I think the key here is that the landlord's duty to maintain the premises in a safe condition isn't something they can completely shift to the tenant via the lease, especially if they knew about the problem. So the employee, as the tenant's employee, might be able to sue the landlord for negligence because the landlord failed to fix a known dangerous condition.

Looking back at the options, Option A says the landlord's duty can't be shifted. That seems correct because public policy might prevent a landlord from avoiding their own negligence by making the tenant take all risks.

So, the employee would prevail because the landlord's duty of care can't be shifted away by the lease terms, especially when the landlord knew about the defect.

The correct answer is **A: landowner's duty of care to third parties cannot be shifted to a tenant by the terms of a lease.**

The landlord's duty to maintain the premises in a safe condition cannot be entirely shifted to the tenant, particularly when the landlord is aware of a dangerous defect and fails to address it before transferring possession. The lease agreement's indemnification clause may not absolve the landlord of liability for their own negligence. Therefore, the employee can prevail because the landlord's duty of care remains non-delegable.

**Answer: A**
