Okay, so I've got this problem here about thermal conductivity, and I'm a bit rusty on my formulas, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand all the details.

The question says there's a flat piece of plastic with an area A of 1 square foot and a thickness b of 0.252 inches. It conducts heat at a rate of 3.0 watts in steady state. The temperatures on the two sides are T0 = 24°C and T1 = 26°C. I need to find the thermal conductivity of the plastic in cal/(sec·cm·°K). The options are given as A through D, but I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that thermal conductivity is related to the Fourier law of heat conduction. The formula I think is Q = (k * A * ΔT) / b, where Q is the heat transfer rate, k is thermal conductivity, A is area, ΔT is the temperature difference, and b is the thickness.

Wait, but the units here are a bit tricky. The heat rate is given in watts, and the thermal conductivity needs to be in cal/(sec·cm·°K). I know that watts are equivalent to joules per second, so I might need to convert units at some point.

Let me jot down what I know:
- A = 1 ft²
- b = 0.252 inches
- Q = 3.0 watts
- T0 = 24°C
- T1 = 26°C
- Need to find k in cal/(s·cm·°K)

First, let's compute ΔT. T1 is 26°C, T0 is 24°C, so ΔT is 2°C. But wait, since thermal conductivity uses temperature difference in Kelvin, and 1°C is the same as 1 K, so ΔT is 2 K. So, that's straightforward.

Next, I need to find the thermal conductivity k. Rearranging the formula: k = (Q * b) / (A * ΔT)

But I have to make sure all units are consistent. Let's start by converting the area A from square feet to square centimeters because the desired unit is in cm.

1 foot is 30.48 cm, so 1 ft² is (30.48 cm)^2 = 30.48 * 30.48 cm². Let me calculate that: 30.48 * 30.48 is approximately 929.03 cm². So A = 929.03 cm².

Next, the thickness b is 0.252 inches. I need to convert inches to centimeters. 1 inch is 2.54 cm, so 0.252 inches * 2.54 cm/inch = let's see, 0.252 * 2.54. Let me compute that: 0.25 * 2.54 is 0.635, and 0.002 * 2.54 is 0.00508, so adding them gives approximately 0.64008 cm. So b ≈ 0.64008 cm.

Now, the heat rate Q is 3.0 watts. Since 1 watt is 1 J/s, and 1 J is equivalent to approximately 0.239 calories (because 1 calorie is about 4.184 J, so 1 J ≈ 1/4.184 calories ≈ 0.239 calories). So, 3.0 watts is 3 J/s, which in calories per second is 3 * 0.239 ≈ 0.717 cal/s.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me correct that. Actually, 1 watt is 1 J/s, and 1 cal is approximately 4.184 J. So to convert J to cal, you divide by 4.184. So 3 J/s is 3 / 4.184 cal/s ≈ 0.717 cal/s. Yes, that's correct.

So now, plug all the values into the formula: k = (Q * b) / (A * ΔT)

Plugging in the numbers:
Q = 0.717 cal/s
b = 0.64008 cm
A = 929.03 cm²
ΔT = 2 K.

So k = (0.717 * 0.64008) / (929.03 * 2)

Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 0.717 * 0.64008 ≈ 0.459 cal·cm/s

Denominator: 929.03 * 2 = 1858.06 cm²·K

So k = 0.459 / 1858.06 ≈ ?

Calculating that: 0.459 divided by 1858.06.

Let me approximate this. 0.459 / 1858 ≈ approximately 2.47 x 10^-4.

Wait, because 1858 is roughly 1.858e3, so 0.459e0 / 1.858e3 ≈ (0.459 / 1.858) x 1e-3 ≈ 0.247 x 1e-3 = 2.47e-4.

So k ≈ 2.47e-4 cal/(s·cm·K).

Now, looking at the options:

A: 2.47 × 10^-4 cal sec^-1 cm^-1 (°C)^-1
B: 2.47 × 10^-4 cal sec^-1 cm^-1 (°K)^-1
C: 1.47 × 10^-4 cal sec^-1 cm^-1 (°K)^-1
D: 2.47 × 10^-3 cal sec^-1 cm^-1 (°K)^-1

Wait, the units in the options are either °C or °K. Since thermal conductivity units can be in either because a temperature difference in °C is the same as in K, but the standard unit is K. So the correct thermal conductivity would have (°K)^-1.

So the correct answer would be option B: 2.47e-4 cal/(s·cm·K).

But wait, looking back at the calculation, I think I made a mistake in calculating Q. Let me double-check that part.

Wait, I converted 3 watts to cal/s as 0.717 cal/s. Let me check that again. 1 J = 0.239 cal, so 3 J/s is 3 * 0.239 = 0.717 cal/s. That part seems correct.

Another thing: in the formula, is the area in the denominator correct? Yes, because Fourier's law is Q = (k A ΔT) / b, so k = Q b / (A ΔT). So units-wise, that should work.

Wait, another thought: sometimes in heat transfer, the formula is written as Q = (k A ΔT) / (b), which is what I used. So the derivation seems correct.

So the calculation gives k ≈ 2.47e-4 cal/(s·cm·K), which matches option B.

The problem involves determining the thermal conductivity of a plastic panel using Fourier's law of heat conduction. The key steps are:

1. **Convert Units**:  
   - Area \( A = 1 \, \text{ft}^2 \) is converted to \( 929.03 \, \text{cm}^2 \).  
   - Thickness \( b = 0.252 \, \text{inches} \) is converted to \( 0.64008 \, \text{cm} \).  
   - Heat rate \( Q = 3.0 \, \text{W} \) is converted to \( 0.717 \, \text{cal/s} \).  

2. **Calculate Thermal Conductivity**:  
   Using the formula \( k = \frac{Q \cdot b}{A \cdot \Delta T} \), where \( \Delta T = 2 \, \text{K} \), the calculation yields \( k \approx 2.47 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{cal/(s·cm·K)} \).  

3. **Select Correct Units**:  
   The correct unit for thermal conductivity is \( \text{cal/(s·cm·K)} \), as temperature differences in \( \text{°C} \) and \( \text{K} \) are equivalent.  

Thus, the correct answer is **B**: \( 2.47 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{cal/(s·cm·K)} \).
