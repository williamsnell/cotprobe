Question:

What is meant by the term ''hypothesis testing''?

Options:

A: Hypothesis testing is the method of confirming the truth of a theory by comparing its predictions with empirical data
B: It involves making predictions about future outcomes based on historical data
C: Hypothesis testing is the process of testing a claim or assertion about a population, based on a sample of data from the population.
D: It is the process of determining the validity of a statistical model
E: It is the process of taking a sample from a population
F: It is the process of making assumptions about a population
G: It is the act of creating a theoretical framework to explain observed phenomena in a population
H: It is the process of calculating the probability of an event occurring within a population
I: It is the process of establishing the cause and effect relationships in a population
J: It is the technique of verifying the consistency of a dataset with another dataset

Okay, so I need to figure out what hypothesis testing means by choosing the correct option from A to J. Let me start by recalling what I know about hypothesis testing.

From what I remember in statistics, hypothesis testing is a method used to make inferences about a population based on sample data. It's like a way to test if a claim about a population is true or not. So, you have a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis. You gather data and then determine whether the data supports the null hypothesis or not.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's about confirming the truth of a theory by comparing predictions with data. Hmm, that sounds close, but I think hypothesis testing isn't just about confirming a theory; it's more about testing a specific claim.

Option B involves making predictions based on historical data. That sounds more like forecasting or maybe regression analysis, not hypothesis testing.

Option C states it's the process of testing a claim about a population using sample data. That aligns with what I remember. Hypothesis testing is indeed about evaluating a claim based on sample data.

Option D talks about determining the validity of a statistical model. I think that's more about model validation, which is a different concept.

Option E is about taking a sample from a population. Well, yes, you do take a sample, but that's just part of the process, not the whole definition.

Option F is making assumptions about a population. Hypothesis testing does involve assumptions, like the distribution of the data, but the overall process is more about testing a specific claim.

Option G mentions creating a theoretical framework. That sounds more like the initial step before testing, not the testing itself.

Option H is about calculating probabilities of events. While probability is involved in hypothesis testing, the term itself refers to the testing process, not just calculating probabilities.

Option I talks about establishing cause and effect. That's more related to experiments and causality, not just hypothesis testing in statistics.

Option J is about verifying consistency between datasets. That doesn't quite fit; hypothesis testing is about testing a specific claim, not comparing datasets.

So, putting it all together, Option C seems to best describe hypothesis testing as the process of testing a claim about a population based on sample data.

The correct answer is C, as hypothesis testing involves evaluating a claim about a population using sample data.

Answer: C
