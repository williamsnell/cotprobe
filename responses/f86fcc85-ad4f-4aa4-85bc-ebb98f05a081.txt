Okay, so I have this question about the percentage of children aged 13-15 in Egypt who reported being bullied at least once in the past couple of months as of 2015. The options are A through J, with percentages ranging from 10% to 100%. 

First, I need to figure out where to find this information. I remember that the World Health Organization (WHO) conducts surveys on health-related behaviors, including bullying. There's a study called the Global School-based Student Health Survey (GSHS), which collects data from students around the world, including Egypt.

I think Egypt participated in the GSHS in 2015. If I recall correctly, the GSHS asks about various health risk behaviors, including bullying. The question specifically asks about children aged 13-15, which aligns with the typical age range surveyed in such studies.

From what I remember, the bullying rates can vary widely by country. In some countries, it's higher, and in others, it's lower. For Egypt, I think the rate was somewhere in the mid to high range. Let me try to recall any specific numbers I might have come across.

I believe that in some reports, the percentage was around 70%. That seems a bit high, but considering the social dynamics in some regions, it might make sense. Alternatively, I could be mixing it up with another country's statistics. 

Wait, another thought: sometimes the data is presented as lifetime prevalence, but the question specifies the past couple of months. That might affect the numbers. I'll have to check if the GSHS reports on recent bullying instances.

Looking back, I think the GSHS 2015 report for Egypt indicated that about 70% of students in that age group reported being bullied in the past month or so. That would point towards option E: 70%.

But I should make sure I'm not confusing it with another country. Let me think if there's any reason why Egypt's rate would be different. Maybe cultural factors influence the reporting, but I don't have specific information on that. 

Another angle: sometimes prevalence is higher in certain regions. If Egypt has higher rates of bullying compared to, say, Europe or North America, then 70% could be plausible. I think I've heard that bullying is quite prevalent in some Middle Eastern countries, though I'm not entirely certain.

I'll go with E: 70% as the answer.

The answer is E: 70%.
