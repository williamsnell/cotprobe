Okay, so I've got this Python question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. The question is about slicing a list using the syntax b[::2], and what the output would be. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that in Python, when you have a list like b = [11,13,15,17,19,21], slicing works with the syntax list[start:end:step]. The default values are start=0, end=len(list), and step=1. But in this case, the step is given as 2, so I think that's what's important here.

Wait, the question is about b[::2]. Oh right, the double colon :: is used for specifying the step. So the syntax here is start at the beginning (since there's nothing before the first colon), end at the end (nothing after the second colon), and step by 2 each time.

So, let's list out the elements of b to see how it works. The list is [11,13,15,17,19,21]. Let me index them: index 0 is 11, index 1 is 13, index 2 is 15, index 3 is 17, index 4 is 19, and index 5 is 21.

When the step is 2, the slice starts at the first element (since start is 0), then takes every second element from there. So the elements would be at indices 0, 2, 4, etc. Wait, but wait, the end is the length of the list, which is 6. So the slice includes elements up to but not including the end index.

So starting at 0, the first element is 11 (index 0). Then step 2 takes us to index 2 (15), then index 4 (19). The next step would be index 6, but since the list only goes up to index 5, we stop there. So the elements are 11, 15, 19.

Wait, let me double-check. So the indices taken are 0, 2, 4. That gives us elements 11, 15, 19. So the resulting list would be [11,15,19]. Looking at the options, that's option E.

But wait, I might be making a mistake here. Sometimes I confuse whether the step includes the end index or not. Let me think again. The slice b[::2] starts at 0, then adds 2 each time. So 0, 2, 4, and 6. But since the list is 6 elements long (indices 0-5), 6 is beyond the list, so it stops at 4. So yes, the elements are 0,2,4: 11,15,19.

Looking at the options: E is [11,15,19]. That must be the correct answer.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes when I'm slicing with a step, I might think about whether it's inclusive or exclusive. For example, if the step is applied after the start and end. So in this case, the end is the length of the list, which is 6. So the slice goes up to 6, but not including it. So 0,2,4 are included, as 6 is the end and not included.

Yes, that's correct. So the output should be [11,15,19], which is option E.

The output of `print(b[::2])` is [11,15,19], which corresponds to option E.

Answer: E
