Okay, let's try to figure out Edith's earnings for the week. So, she has a weekly salary of $80, and then she gets a 5% commission on her sales over $1,000. Her sales last week were $1,354.20. 

First, I think I need to calculate the commission. Since the commission is only on the amount over $1,000, I'll subtract $1,000 from her total sales. So, $1,354.20 minus $1,000 equals $354.20. Now, I have to find 5% of $354.20. 

To calculate 5%, I can multiply $354.20 by 0.05. Let me do that: 354.20 * 0.05. Hmm, 350 * 0.05 is 17.5, and 4.20 * 0.05 is 0.21. So adding those together, 17.5 + 0.21 equals $17.71. 

So her commission is $17.71. Now, her total earnings should be her base salary plus the commission. Her base is $80, so adding that to $17.71: 80 + 17.71 is $97.71. 

Wait, let me double-check the math to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The commission calculation: 354.20 * 0.05. Let me compute it again. 354.20 * 0.05 is the same as dividing 354.20 by 20, which is 17.71. Yep, that's correct. 

So her total earnings would be $80 + $17.71, which is indeed $97.71. Looking at the options, I see that option I is $97.71. So I think the correct answer is I.

The earnings are calculated by adding the base salary of $80 to 5% commission on sales over $1,000. Sales over $1,000 are $354.20, yielding a commission of $17.71. Total earnings are $80 + $17.71 = $97.71.
