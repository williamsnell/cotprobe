Okay, so I've got this limit problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about integrals and limits, which I find a bit tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The problem is asking for the limit as r approaches infinity of the ratio of two integrals: the numerator is the integral from 0 to π/2 of x^r sin(x) dx, and the denominator is r times the integral from 0 to π/2 of x^r cos(x) dx. So, the expression is:

lim(r→∞) [ ∫₀^{π/2} x^r sin(x) dx ] / [ r ∫₀^{π/2} x^r cos(x) dx ]

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with integrals of the form ∫ x^r f(x) dx from 0 to some upper limit, especially as r becomes very large, the integral tends to be dominated by the behavior of the integrand near the upper limit. I think this is because x^r grows rapidly as x approaches 1 (since we're integrating from 0 to π/2, which is approximately 1.5708, but x is in that interval, so as r increases, x^r becomes very small except near x=1). Wait, but in this case, the upper limit is π/2, which is about 1.5708, so x will be between 0 and that. Wait, but when r is large, x^r is largest when x is as large as possible. So the integrals are probably dominated by the contributions near x = π/2.

So, maybe I can approximate the integrals by expanding sin(x) and cos(x) around x = π/2. Let me set x = π/2 - t, where t is a small positive number when x is near π/2. Then, as r becomes large, t will be small, so I can approximate sin(x) and cos(x) using Taylor series around t=0.

Let me compute sin(π/2 - t) and cos(π/2 - t). I know that:

sin(π/2 - t) = cos(t) ≈ 1 - t²/2 + t^4/24 - ...
cos(π/2 - t) = sin(t) ≈ t - t^3/6 + t^5/120 - ...

But wait, actually, when x approaches π/2, t approaches 0. So, the expressions become:

sin(x) = sin(π/2 - t) = cos(t) ≈ 1 - t²/2 + ...
cos(x) = cos(π/2 - t) = sin(t) ≈ t - t^3/6 + ...

Wait, but maybe I should expand around t=0. Alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution to make the integral more manageable. Let me try substituting x = π/2 - t, so when x approaches π/2, t approaches 0.

Then, dx = -dt, and when x=0, t=π/2, but since the integral is from 0 to π/2, after substitution, the limits become t=π/2 to t=0. I can reverse the limits and remove the negative sign, so the integral becomes from t=0 to t=π/2.

So, the numerator integral becomes:

∫₀^{π/2} x^r sin(x) dx = ∫₀^{π/2} (π/2 - t)^r * cos(t) dt

Similarly, the denominator integral becomes:

∫₀^{π/2} x^r cos(x) dx = ∫₀^{π/2} (π/2 - t)^r * sin(t) dt

Now, as r becomes very large, the (π/2 - t)^r term will be significant only when t is very small, because (π/2 - t) is near π/2 when t is near 0. So, the main contribution to the integrals comes from t near 0. Therefore, I can approximate the integrals by extending the upper limit to infinity, because the tails beyond a small t won't contribute much. So, I can approximate the integrals as:

∫₀^{∞} (π/2 - t)^r * [cos(t) or sin(t)] dt

But wait, t is approaching 0, so maybe I can make another substitution. Let me set u = t * sqrt(r), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out (π/2)^r from the integrals. Let's see.

(π/2)^r is a common factor in both integrals. So, let's factor that out.

Numerator integral: (π/2)^r ∫₀^{π/2} [1 - (2t)/(π)]^r cos(t) dt

Similarly, denominator integral: (π/2)^r ∫₀^{π/2} [1 - (2t)/(π)]^r sin(t) dt

Wait, because (π/2 - t) = π/2 (1 - (2t)/π). So, (π/2 - t)^r = (π/2)^r [1 - (2t)/π]^r.

Now, for large r, [1 - (2t)/π]^r can be approximated using the exponential function. Recall that for small a, (1 - a)^r ≈ e^{-a r} when r is large. So, if (2t)/π is small, which it will be near t=0, then [1 - (2t)/π]^r ≈ e^{- (2t r)/π}.

So, substituting this approximation, the integrals can be approximated as:

Numerator: (π/2)^r ∫₀^{∞} e^{- (2t r)/π} cos(t) dt

Denominator: (π/2)^r ∫₀^{∞} e^{- (2t r)/π} sin(t) dt

Wait, I extended the upper limit to infinity because for large r, the integrand decays rapidly beyond a certain point, so the approximation should be good. Now, the ratio of the numerator to the denominator is:

[ (π/2)^r ∫₀^{∞} e^{- (2t r)/π} cos(t) dt ] / [ r (π/2)^r ∫₀^{∞} e^{- (2t r)/π} sin(t) dt ]

The (π/2)^r terms cancel out, leaving:

[ ∫₀^{∞} e^{- (2t r)/π} cos(t) dt ] / [ r ∫₀^{∞} e^{- (2t r)/π} sin(t) dt ]

Now, let's consider the integrals ∫₀^{∞} e^{-a t} cos(t) dt and ∫₀^{∞} e^{-a t} sin(t) dt, where a = 2r/π.

I remember that these integrals have standard Laplace transform results. Specifically:

∫₀^{∞} e^{-a t} cos(t) dt = a / (a² + 1)
∫₀^{∞} e^{-a t} sin(t) dt = 1 / (a² + 1)

So, plugging these into our expressions, we get:

Numerator integral: a / (a² + 1) = (2r/π) / [ (2r/π)^2 + 1 ]
Denominator integral: 1 / (a² + 1) = 1 / [ (2r/π)^2 + 1 ]

So, the ratio becomes:

[ (2r/π) / ( (2r/π)^2 + 1 ) ] / [ r * (1 / ( (2r/π)^2 + 1 )) ]

Simplify the denominator: r * [1 / ( (2r/π)^2 + 1 ) ] = r / ( (4r²/π²) + 1 )

So, the entire expression is:

[ (2r/π) / ( (4r²/π²) + 1 ) ) ] / [ r / ( (4r²/π²) + 1 ) ) ]

Notice that the denominators are the same, so when we divide, they cancel out. So, we have:

(2r/π) / r = 2/π

Because the (4r²/π² + 1) terms in the numerator and denominator of the ratio cancel each other, and the r in the numerator cancels with the r in the denominator.

So, the limit is 2/π. Now, let me compute 2 divided by π. π is approximately 3.14159265, so 2/π ≈ 0.63661977...

Looking at the options, option G is 0.63662, which matches this value. So, the answer should be G.

The limit evaluates to 2/π, which is approximately 0.63662.
