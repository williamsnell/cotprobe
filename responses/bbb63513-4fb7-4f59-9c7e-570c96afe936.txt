Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question about monopolistic competition. The question is asking what happens to costs when new firms enter the industry, given that existing firms are making above-normal profits. Hmm, I remember that in monopolistically competitive markets, there are a lot of firms, each producing differentiated products. 

So, if firms are making above-normal profits, that should attract new entrants. When new firms enter, the market becomes more competitive. But wait, in monopolistic competition, each firm's product is somewhat unique, so new firms might not directly compete on price but on differentiation. However, as more firms come in, the overall demand for each firm's product might decrease because consumers have more options. 

Wait, but how does that affect costs? I think in the long run, when new firms enter, the industry supply increases. If demand doesn't increase proportionally, each firm's average revenue might fall. Firms might start competing on price, which could lead to lower prices. But how does this relate to costs? 

In the short run, new entrants might invest in new production methods or facilities, which could temporarily increase costs. But in the long run, as the market adjusts, costs might decrease because of economies of scale. Or maybe not. Wait, in monopolistic competition, firms don't typically have significant economies of scale because the products are differentiated, so production might not become much more efficient as more firms enter. 

Alternatively, when new firms enter, they might have to spend more on marketing, advertising, and product differentiation, which could increase their costs. But the question is about the overall costs in the industry. I'm a bit confused. 

Wait, the initial condition is that firms are enjoying above-normal profits. That's a signal that the industry is profitable, so new firms will enter. As they enter, the market becomes more saturated. Each firm's demand curve shifts left, leading to lower prices. Since prices fall, and if costs are fixed, profits would decrease. But the question is about costs, not prices. 

In the long run, with more firms, each firm's average total cost might not change much because the scale of production isn't increasing enough to gain significant economies of scale. So costs might remain the same. Or perhaps costs could decrease if new technologies are adopted as more firms enter and share R&D costs. But I'm not sure. 

Wait, another angle: when new firms enter, they might bring in new technologies or more efficient production methods, which could lower costs. But in monopolistic competition, product differentiation is key, so maybe the focus is more on marketing than production efficiency. So perhaps costs don't decrease much. 

Alternatively, if more firms enter, the cost of inputs like labor or materials might rise if they become more scarce. But that's probably not the main factor here. 

I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the model. In monopolistic competition, in the long run, firms earn zero economic profit because new entrants drive down profits. So if they were making above-normal profits, new firms come in, leading to lower profits. But how does that affect costs? Well, if the new firms bring in more competition, they might produce more efficiently, but I'm not certain. 

Wait, maybe costs don't change because each firm's production isn't scaled up enough to lower average costs. So costs would remain the same. Or perhaps costs increase because new firms invest in new plants and equipment, temporarily driving up costs. But I'm not sure. 

I think the answer might be that costs remain the same because in the long run, the entry of firms doesn't significantly change the cost structure; instead, it's the prices that fall. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe costs decrease due to increased competition leading to better efficiency. Hmm. 

I think the most likely answer is that costs will tend to rise because as more firms enter, they might have to invest more in things like marketing, which could increase costs. Or perhaps the costs of inputs might increase due to higher demand. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe costs remain the same because each firm's production scale doesn't change much. 

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating it. In monopolistic competition, when new firms enter, the demand for each firm's product decreases, leading to lower prices. But costs are determined by production. If production per firm doesn't change much, costs remain the same. So maybe the answer is D: costs will remain the same. But I'm still a bit unsure. Another thought: maybe with more firms, the cost of inputs like labor could increase if demand for labor goes up, but that's probably not the primary factor here. 

I think I'll go with the idea that costs remain the same because the entry of new firms doesn't significantly affect the production costs of individual firms in the long run. So the answer would be D.

In a monopolistically competitive industry, when firms are enjoying above-normal profits, new entrants are attracted to the market. As more firms enter, the market becomes more competitive, and the demand for each firm's product decreases, leading to lower prices. However, the question focuses on the effect on costs rather than prices. 

In the long run, the entry of new firms does not significantly alter the production scale of individual firms, meaning that economies of scale are not realized to a great extent. Therefore, the cost structure for firms remains relatively unchanged. While new firms might invest in marketing or differentiation, these actions do not necessarily lead to a significant change in overall production costs. Thus, costs will likely remain the same as new firms enter the industry.
