Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Differentiate clearly between "breathing" and "respiration".

Options:

A: Breathing is the chemical process that occurs within cells, while respiration is the physical movement of the diaphragm and rib muscles.
B: Respiration only occurs in the presence of oxygen, while breathing can occur without oxygen.
C: Breathing refers to the exchange of gases between cells and environment, while respiration is the mechanical process of taking air into the lungs and expelling it.
D: Respiration refers to the oxidative degradation of nutrients in cells or the exchange of gases between cells and environment, while breathing is the mechanical process of taking air into the lungs and expelling it.
E: Respiration and breathing are the same process.
F: Respiration is the process by which organisms produce sound, while breathing is solely for gas exchange purposes.
G: Breathing is the process of breaking down food into energy, while respiration is the act of air moving in and out of the lungs.
H: Respiration is an energy consuming process, while breathing results in energy production in the cells.
I: Breathing involves the conversion of glucose to energy within the mitochondria, while respiration is the act of inhaling and exhaling air.
J: Respiration is a voluntary action controlled by the nervous system, while breathing is an involuntary process controlled by the brain stem.

Okay, so I have this question about differentiating between "breathing" and "respiration." Hmm, I think I remember that these terms are related but not exactly the same. Let me try to break it down.

First, I'll think about what each term means. Breathing, as I understand it, is the physical action of taking in air and exhaling it. Like when you take a deep breath in and then let it out. It's something you do all the time, even though sometimes it's voluntary, like when you hold your breath or take a deep inhale on purpose.

Respiration, on the other hand, I think is a broader term. From what I've learned before, respiration includes not just the physical act of breathing but also the chemical processes that happen in the body to convert food into energy. Oh wait, that's cellular respiration, right? So respiration might refer to the entire process of taking in oxygen and using it in cells to produce ATP, which is energy. That includes both the transport of gases through the bloodstream and the metabolic processes in the cells.

Let me look at the options to see which one matches this understanding.

Option A says breathing is the chemical process in cells, which doesn't sound right because that's respiration. So A is probably wrong.

Option B says respiration needs oxygen, but I remember that some organisms can respire without oxygen, like anaerobic respiration. So B might not be correct.

Option C says breathing is exchange of gases between cells and environment, while respiration is mechanical. Wait, no, I think it's the other way around. Breathing is mechanical (inhaling and exhaling), and respiration is the exchange of gases, including cellular processes. So C might have it reversed.

Option D says respiration refers to oxidative degradation of nutrients or gas exchange, while breathing is the mechanical process. That sounds more accurate. Because respiration includes both the transport (gas exchange) and the cellular breakdown for energy. So D seems correct.

Option E says they're the same, which isn't right because they're different processes, so E is wrong.

Option F talks about sound production, which is unrelated. Breathing is for gas exchange, so F is incorrect.

Option G reverses the processes again, saying breathing is breaking down food, which is respiration. So G is wrong.

Option H says respiration uses energy, but actually, respiration produces energy. So H is incorrect.

Option I also reverses the terms, saying breathing is cellular energy, which is respiration. So I is wrong.

Option J says respiration is voluntary and breathing is involuntary. Wait, actually, breathing can be both. Like, when you breathe normally, it's controlled by the brain stem, so it's involuntary, but you can control it to some extent, like holding your breath. But I'm not sure if this is the best option because the main point is about the processes themselves, not control.

So, going back, the main difference is that breathing is the mechanical process of moving air in and out, while respiration includes that plus the exchange of gases and the cellular processes. Option D captures that well. It says respiration refers to the breakdown of nutrients (like cellular respiration) or gas exchange, while breathing is the mechanical process. That fits what I was thinking.

The correct answer is D. Breathing refers to the mechanical process of inhaling and exhaling air, while respiration encompasses the broader processes, including gas exchange and the cellular breakdown of nutrients to produce energy.

Answer: D
