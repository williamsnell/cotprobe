Okay, so I have this limit problem: the limit as n approaches infinity of (n!)^(1/n) divided by n. Hmm, I remember that factorials can be tricky when dealing with limits, especially involving exponents. Let me think about how to approach this.

I recall that Stirling's approximation might be useful here. Stirling's formula approximates n! for large n. The formula is n! ≈ sqrt(2πn) * (n/e)^n. So maybe I can use that to simplify (n!)^(1/n).

Let me write that down. Using Stirling's approximation, n! ≈ sqrt(2πn) * (n/e)^n. Taking the nth root of both sides, (n!)^(1/n) ≈ [sqrt(2πn)]^(1/n) * (n/e).

Wait, sqrt(2πn) is the same as (2πn)^(1/2). So [sqrt(2πn)]^(1/n) would be [ (2πn)^(1/2) ]^(1/n) = (2πn)^(1/(2n)). As n approaches infinity, 1/(2n) approaches 0, so (2πn)^(1/(2n)) approaches e^0, which is 1. Because any number to the power of 0 is 1. So that term goes to 1.

Therefore, (n!)^(1/n) ≈ (n/e) as n becomes large. So the expression (n!)^(1/n)/n would be approximately (n/e)/n, which simplifies to 1/e.

Wait, 1/e is approximately 0.367879441. Let me check the options. Option D is 0.367879441, so that must be the answer.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again. Stirling's formula: n! ≈ sqrt(2πn) (n/e)^n. Taking the nth root gives (n!)^(1/n) ≈ (sqrt(2πn))^(1/n) * (n/e). The first term is (2πn)^(1/(2n)), which as n→∞, approaches e^(0) =1, since ln(2πn)/(2n) approaches 0. So yeah, that term is 1. So (n!)^(1/n) ≈ n/e. Dividing by n gives 1/e, so the limit is 1/e.

Another way to think about it: maybe using logarithms. Let me take the natural log of the expression. Let L = lim_{n→∞} (n!)^{1/n}/n. Then ln(L) = lim_{n→∞} [ (1/n) ln(n!) - ln(n) ].

Using Stirling's approximation again, ln(n!) ≈ n ln n - n + (1/2) ln(2πn). So substituting that in:

ln(L) = lim [ (1/n)(n ln n - n + (1/2) ln(2πn)) - ln n ].

Simplify term by term:

(1/n)(n ln n) = ln n,

(1/n)(-n) = -1,

(1/n)( (1/2) ln(2πn) ) = (1/(2n)) ln(2πn),

Then subtract ln n.

So putting it all together:

ln(L) = lim [ ln n - 1 + (1/(2n)) ln(2πn) - ln n ].

The ln n terms cancel out, leaving:

ln(L) = lim [ -1 + (1/(2n)) ln(2πn) ].

As n approaches infinity, (1/(2n)) ln(2πn) approaches 0 because ln(n) grows much slower than n. So we're left with ln(L) = -1. Therefore, L = e^{-1} = 1/e ≈ 0.367879441.

Yep, that confirms it. So the limit is 1/e, which is option D.

The limit of \((n!)^{1/n}/n\) as \(n\) approaches infinity is \(1/e\), which is approximately \(0.367879441\). This result is obtained using Stirling's approximation and confirming through logarithmic analysis.
