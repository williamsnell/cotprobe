Answer:

Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about diluting a solution of HF to double its percent dissociation. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that HF is a weak acid. Its dissociation in water can be represented as HF ⇌ H+ + F-. The problem gives me the initial concentration as 0.5 M and the dissociation constant, K_diss, which I think is the acid dissociation constant, K_a. Wait, actually, sometimes K_diss is used instead of K_a, but I think they are the same. So K_a here is 6.71 × 10^-4.

The question is about dilution affecting the percent dissociation. I recall that when you dilute a weak acid, it dissociates more because the concentration of H+ ions is lower, so Le Chatelier's principle tells me the system will shift to produce more H+ to counteract that change.

The goal is to find out how much the solution needs to be diluted so that the percent dissociation doubles. Hmm, I need to find the dilution factor that results in doubling the percent dissociation.

Let me think about what percent dissociation means. It's the amount of HF that dissociates divided by the initial concentration, multiplied by 100%. So if initially the percent dissociation is α%, after dilution it should be 2α%.

Let me denote the initial concentration as C1 = 0.5 M, and the final concentration after dilution as C2 = C1 / D, where D is the dilution factor. The dilution factor D tells us how many times we've diluted the solution. So if D is 2, it's diluted twice, like from 0.5 M to 0.25 M.

Now, for a weak acid, the approximation is often made that [H+] = sqrt(K_a * C), assuming that α is small, so that the dissociation is minimal. But wait, I should check if this approximation holds. If K_a is about 6.7e-4 and initial concentration is 0.5 M, then K_a / C would be (6.7e-4)/(0.5) ≈ 1.34e-3, which is small enough that the approximation should work. So I can proceed with that.

So the initial dissociation α1 is sqrt(K_a / C1) = sqrt(6.71e-4 / 0.5) = sqrt(1.342e-3) ≈ 0.03664, which is about 3.664%. So the percent dissociation is approximately 3.664%.

We want to double this, so α2 should be about 7.328%. Wait, but wait a second. I remember that for weak acids, when you dilute, the percent dissociation increases, but not linearly. So I can't just take 2α and apply the same formula because the approximation might not hold as well when α becomes larger.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use the exact expression without the approximation. Let me think.

The dissociation equation is HF ⇌ H+ + F-. Let x be the concentration of H+ at equilibrium. Then, the expression for K_a is x^2 / (C - x) = K_a. So solving for x gives x = [ -K_a + sqrt(K_a^2 + 4 K_a C) ] / (2). But that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, using the approximation x ≈ sqrt(K_a C) when K_a << C, which holds for the initial case.

But when we dilute, C becomes smaller, so the approximation might not hold as well. So maybe it's better to work with the exact equation.

Wait, perhaps I can relate the percent dissociations before and after dilution. Let me denote the initial percent dissociation as α1, and the final as α2 = 2α1.

In terms of concentration, α1 = x1 / C1, and α2 = x2 / C2.

But since the solution is being diluted, the amount of H+ ions doesn't change much if dilution is done without adding or removing H+ (assuming dilution with water). Wait, no, that's not correct. When you dilute a solution, the concentration of H+ decreases, which causes more dissociation to occur, increasing [H+]. So the exact amount of H+ after dilution isn't the same as before; it's a dynamic equilibrium.

Hmm, perhaps I should model the situation with the exact expressions.

Let me consider the initial solution:

At initial concentration C1 = 0.5 M. The dissociation is governed by K_a = [H+][F-]/[HF] = x^2/(C1 - x) = 6.71e-4.

Using the approximation, x ≈ sqrt(K_a * C1) ≈ sqrt(6.71e-4 * 0.5) ≈ sqrt(3.355e-4) ≈ 0.01832 M. So [H+] ≈ 0.01832 M, and percent dissociation α1 = (0.01832 / 0.5) * 100 ≈ 3.664%.

Now, after dilution, the concentration becomes C2 = C1 / D. The new dissociation x2 will be such that K_a = (x2)^2 / (C2 - x2) = 6.71e-4. We want α2 = 2α1, so x2/C2 = 2*(x1/C1).

Let me compute α1 first. As x1 ≈ 0.01832, α1 ≈ 3.664%, so α2 ≈ 7.328%.

Thus, x2 = C2 * α2 = (0.5/D) * 0.07328 ≈ 0.03664 / D.

Wait, but substituting x2 into the K_a expression:

x2^2 / (C2 - x2) = 6.71e-4.

Plugging in x2 = C2 * α2 (since α2 = x2/C2), and C2 = 0.5/D.

So x2 = (0.5/D) * α2.

But α2 = 2 α1, and α1 = x1/C1 ≈ 0.01832 / 0.5 ≈ 0.03664, so α2 = 0.07328.

Thus, x2 = (0.5/D) * 0.07328 ≈ (0.03664)/D.

Putting this into the K_a expression:

x2^2 / (C2 - x2) = ( (0.03664/D)^2 ) / ( (0.5/D) - (0.03664/D) ) )

= ( (0.03664^2) / D^2 ) / ( (0.5 - 0.03664)/D )

= (0.03664^2) / D^2 * D / (0.46336)

= (0.03664^2) / (D * 0.46336 )

Set this equal to K_a = 6.71e-4.

So,

(0.03664^2) / (D * 0.46336) ) = 6.71e-4.

Let me compute 0.03664 squared: 0.03664^2 ≈ 0.001342.

Then,

0.001342 / (D * 0.46336) ) = 6.71e-4.

Multiply both sides by D * 0.46336:

0.001342 = 6.71e-4 * D * 0.46336.

Compute 6.71e-4 * 0.46336 ≈ 6.71e-4 * 0.46336 ≈ (approx 6.71 * 0.46336) * 1e-4.

6.71 * 0.46336 ≈ let's see:

6 * 0.46336 = 2.78016, 0.71 * 0.46336 ≈ 0.3305, so total ≈ 3.11066.

So 3.11066e-4.

So,

0.001342 = 3.11066e-4 * D.

Solving for D:

D = 0.001342 / (3.11066e-4) ≈ 4.313.

Wait, but wait a second. That would suggest D ≈ 4.31. But looking at the options, option A is 4.13, which is close but not exactly 4.31. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, maybe I should recheck the exact steps. Let me go through the calculations again.

Another approach: Let's denote the initial solution as solution 1, and the diluted solution as solution 2.

For solution 1:

C1 = 0.5 M.

At equilibrium, [H+] = x1, so K_a = x1²/(C1 - x1) = 6.71e-4.

Assuming x1 << C1, which is valid because 6.71e-4 is much smaller than 0.5.

So x1 ≈ sqrt(6.71e-4 * 0.5) = sqrt(3.355e-4) ≈ 0.01832 M.

Thus, α1 = x1/C1 = 0.01832 / 0.5 = 0.03664 or 3.664%.

We want to find the dilution factor D such that the new α2 = 2 * α1 = 7.328%.

In solution 2, the concentration is C2 = C1 / D = 0.5/D.

The K_a expression for solution 2 is x2²/(C2 - x2) = 6.71e-4.

We want α2 = x2/C2 = 0.07328.

So x2 = C2 * α2 = (0.5/D) * 0.07328 = 0.03664 / D.

Substitute into K_a:

x2²/(C2 - x2) = ( (0.03664/D)^2 ) / ( (0.5/D) - (0.03664/D) ) ) = (0.03664²/D²) / ( (0.5 - 0.03664)/D ) 

Simplify denominator: 0.5 - 0.03664 = 0.46336.

So denominator becomes 0.46336/D.

Thus, the entire expression becomes:

(0.03664² / D²) / (0.46336/D) ) = (0.03664²) / (D²) * (D / 0.46336) ) = (0.03664²) / (D * 0.46336) 

Set equal to K_a:

(0.03664²) / (D * 0.46336) ) = 6.71e-4.

Compute numerator: 0.03664² ≈ 0.001342.

So,

0.001342 / (D * 0.46336) ) = 6.71e-4.

Multiply both sides by D * 0.46336:

0.001342 = 6.71e-4 * D * 0.46336.

Compute 6.71e-4 * 0.46336:

6.71 * 0.46336 ≈ 3.11066 → 3.11066e-4.

So,

0.001342 = 3.11066e-4 * D.

Solving for D:

D = 0.001342 / (3.11066e-4) ≈ (0.001342) / (0.000311066) ≈ 4.313.

So the dilution factor D is approximately 4.31, meaning the solution should be diluted about 4.31 times. But looking at the options, the closest is A: 4.13. Hmm, maybe my approximation isn't accurate enough because I'm assuming x2 is small, but when α2 is 7.3%, x2 = 0.07328 * C2 = 0.07328 * (0.5/D). Let's check if x2 is still much smaller than C2.

If D=4.31, C2=0.5/4.31≈0.116 M. x2=0.07328 * 0.116 ≈ 0.0085 M. Then, C2 - x2 ≈ 0.116 - 0.0085=0.1075. So x2 is about 7% of C2, which is not that small. So the approximation x2≈sqrt(K_a C2) might not be valid anymore, which suggests that using the approximation might have introduced some error.

Alternatively, perhaps I should solve the exact equation without the approximation.

So for solution 2:

x2² = K_a (C2 - x2).

We have x2 = α2 * C2 = 0.07328 * C2.

Substituting into the equation:

(0.07328 C2)^2 = 6.71e-4 (C2 - 0.07328 C2).

Simplify:

(0.07328)^2 C2² = 6.71e-4 * C2 (1 - 0.07328).

Compute 0.07328^2 ≈ (0.07328)^2 ≈ 0.005371.

So,

0.005371 C2² = 6.71e-4 * C2 * 0.92672.

Divide both sides by C2 (assuming C2 ≠0):

0.005371 C2 = 6.71e-4 * 0.92672.

Compute RHS: 6.71e-4 * 0.92672 ≈ 6.71e-4 * 0.92672 ≈ 6.222e-4.

So,

0.005371 C2 = 6.222e-4.

Thus,

C2 = (6.222e-4) / 0.005371 ≈ 0.1158 M.

So the new concentration C2 is approximately 0.1158 M.

The dilution factor D is C1 / C2 = 0.5 / 0.1158 ≈ 4.316.

Which is similar to my earlier approximation, around 4.31. But the available options don't have 4.31. The closest is option A:4.13. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, let me check the exact computation again. Maybe I should avoid approximations and solve it more accurately.

Let me set up the exact equation for solution 2.

We have:

x2² = K_a (C2 - x2).

And α2 = x2 / C2 = 2 α1.

From solution 1, α1 = sqrt(K_a / C1) ≈ 0.03664.

But without approximation, α1 is given by:

α1 = [ -K_a + sqrt(K_a^2 + 4 K_a C1) ] / (2 K_a C1) ) ? Wait, perhaps I should solve for α1 exactly.

Wait, for solution 1:

x1² = K_a (C1 - x1).

Let me solve this quadratic equation numerically.

x1² + K_a x1 - K_a C1 = 0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [ -K_a + sqrt(K_a^2 +4 K_a C1) ] / 2.

Wait, no, the equation is x² + K_a x - K_a C1 = 0.

So a=1, b=K_a, c= -K_a C1.

So x1 = [ -b ± sqrt(b² -4ac) ] / (2a).

So,

x1 = [ -K_a + sqrt( (K_a)^2 +4 K_a C1 ) ] / 2.

Wait, because the other root would be negative, which doesn't make sense.

So,

x1 = [ -6.71e-4 + sqrt( (6.71e-4)^2 +4 *6.71e-4 *0.5 ) ] / 2.

Compute inside the sqrt:

(6.71e-4)^2 = approx 4.502e-7.

4 *6.71e-4 *0.5 = 4 *6.71e-4 *0.5 = 4 * 3.355e-4 = 1.342e-3.

So sum is 4.502e-7 +1.342e-3 ≈ 1.34245e-3.

sqrt(1.34245e-3) ≈ 0.03664.

So,

x1 = [ -0.000671 + 0.03664 ] / 2 ≈ (0.035969) / 2 ≈ 0.0179845 M.

Which is close to our initial approximation of 0.01832 M.

So α1 = x1/C1 = 0.0179845 / 0.5 ≈ 0.03597, or 3.597%.

We want α2 = 2 * α1 = 7.194%.

So for solution 2, x2 = α2 * C2.

Also, x2² = K_a (C2 - x2).

Substituting x2 = α2 * C2.

So,

(α2 C2)^2 = K_a (C2 - α2 C2).

=>

α2² C2² = K_a C2 (1 - α2).

Divide both sides by C2 (assuming C2≠0):

α2² C2 = K_a (1 - α2).

So,

C2 = [ K_a (1 - α2) ] / α2².

We know α2 = 7.194% = 0.07194.

So,

C2 = [6.71e-4 * (1 - 0.07194)] / (0.07194)^2.

Compute numerator:

6.71e-4 * (0.92806) ≈ 6.71e-4 * 0.92806 ≈ let's calculate:

6.71 * 0.92806 ≈ 6.226 → 6.226e-4.

Denominator:

(0.07194)^2 ≈ 0.005174.

So,

C2 = 6.226e-4 / 0.005174 ≈ 0.1199 M.

Thus, C2 ≈ 0.1199 M.

The dilution factor D is C1 / C2 = 0.5 / 0.1199 ≈ 4.167.

Which is approximately 4.17. Looking at the options, option A is 4.13, which is close. Hmm, perhaps I made some rounding errors. Let me recalculate more accurately.

Let me compute 6.71e-4 * (1 - 0.07194) again:

1 - 0.07194 = 0.92806.

6.71e-4 * 0.92806 = ?

6.71 * 0.92806 = let's compute precisely.

6 * 0.92806 = 5.56836

0.71 * 0.92806 = approx 0.71 * 0.928 ≈ 0.65948.

Total: 5.56836 + 0.65948 ≈ 6.22784.

So 6.22784e-4.

Denominator: (0.07194)^2 = 0.07194 * 0.07194.

Let me compute that:

0.07 * 0.07 = 0.0049.

0.00194 * 0.07 = 0.0001358.

0.07 * 0.00194 = same as above.

0.00194 *0.00194 ≈ 0.00000376.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate 0.07194^2.

I can compute 71.94e-3 squared: (71.94)^2 = approx 71^2 =5041, 0.94^2=0.8836, but perhaps a better way:

0.07194 * 0.07194:

= (0.07 + 0.00194)^2

= 0.07² + 2*0.07*0.00194 + (0.00194)^2

= 0.0049 + 0.0002716 + 0.00000376 ≈ 0.00517536.

So denominator is 0.00517536.

So C2 = (6.22784e-4) / (0.00517536) ≈ 0.11999 M.

So D = 0.5 / 0.11999 ≈ 4.166.

Which is about 4.166, so approximately 4.17. The closest option is A:4.13, but that's a bit off. Let me check if I made a mistake in the calculation of α2.

Wait, maybe I should use more precise values for α1 and α2.

Let me compute α1 more accurately.

From solution 1, using exact method:

x1 = [ -6.71e-4 + sqrt( (6.71e-4)^2 +4 *6.71e-4 *0.5 ) ] / 2.

Compute inside the sqrt:

(6.71e-4)^2 = 4.50241e-7.

4 *6.71e-4 *0.5 = 1.342e-3.

Total inside sqrt: 1.342450241e-3.

sqrt(1.342450241e-3) ≈ 0.03664.

So,

x1 = ( -0.000671 + 0.03664 ) / 2 ≈ (0.035969) / 2 ≈ 0.0179845 M.

Thus, α1 = 0.0179845 / 0.5 = 0.035969, or 3.5969%.

So α2 = 2 * 3.5969% = 7.1938%.

Now, let's compute C2 using α2 = 7.1938%.

C2 = [ K_a (1 - α2) ] / (α2)^2.

Plugging in:

K_a =6.71e-4.

1 - α2 = 1 - 0.071938 = 0.928062.

α2^2 = (0.071938)^2 ≈ 0.005174.

So,

C2 = (6.71e-4 * 0.928062) / 0.005174.

Compute numerator: 6.71e-4 * 0.928062 ≈ 6.71 * 0.928062 ≈ let's calculate:

6 * 0.928062 = 5.568372.

0.71 * 0.928062 ≈ 0.659483.

Total ≈ 5.568372 +0.659483 ≈ 6.227855 → 6.227855e-4.

Denominator: 0.005174.

So,

C2 = 6.227855e-4 / 0.005174 ≈ 0.11999 M.

So D = 0.5 / 0.11999 ≈ 4.167.

Looking at the options, the closest is A:4.13, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the approximation method, which gives D≈4.31, but that's not an option either. Alternatively, perhaps I should try a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I can use the relationship between dilution and percent dissociation. For weak acids, the percent dissociation α is approximately sqrt(K_a / C). So α ∝ 1/sqrt(C). If we want to double α, then 2α ≈ sqrt(K_a / C2). So (2α)^2 ≈ K_a / C2 → 4α² ≈ K_a / C2.

But from the initial condition, α² ≈ K_a / C1 → C1 = K_a / α².

So for the new condition, C2 = K_a / (4 α²) = C1 /4.

Wait, that would suggest that D=4. So the dilution factor is 4. But that's not matching our earlier calculation. Hmm, maybe this is a simplified approach.

Wait, but I think this approach assumes that α is small and uses the approximation, which might not be accurate. Because when α doubles, the approximation might not hold as well. But perhaps this is the approach expected in the problem.

If D=4, then option A is 4.13, which is close to 4. So perhaps the correct answer is A:4.13.

But earlier, when using the exact method, I got around 4.17, which isn't exactly 4.13. Maybe the options are rounded, or perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, perhaps the exact value using the quadratic solution is around 4.17, but the options don't have that. The closest is A:4.13, so perhaps that's the intended answer.

To determine the dilution factor required to double the percent dissociation of HF, we start with the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{HF} \leftrightharpoons \text{H}^+ + \text{F}^-
\]

The dissociation constant is given as \( K_a = 6.71 \times 10^{-4} \), and the initial concentration is \( C_1 = 0.5 \, \text{M} \). The goal is to find the dilution factor \( D \) such that the percent dissociation doubles.

### Step 1: Initial Percent Dissociation
Using the approximation for weak acids, the initial dissociation \( \alpha_1 \) is:

\[
\alpha_1 = \sqrt{\frac{K_a}{C_1}} = \sqrt{\frac{6.71 \times 10^{-4}}{0.5}} \approx 0.03664 \, (\text{or } 3.664\%).
\]

The target percent dissociation is \( \alpha_2 = 2 \alpha_1 = 0.07328 \, (\text{or } 7.328\%)) \).

### Step 2: Expression for Diluted Solution
After dilution, the new concentration is \( C_2 = \frac{C_1}{D} \). The dissociation at the new concentration satisfies:

\[
\alpha_2 = \frac{x_2}{C_2},
\]

where \( x_2 \) is the concentration of \( \text{H}^+ \) ions at equilibrium. Substituting \( x_2 = \alpha_2 C_2 \) into the \( K_a \) expression:

\[
K_a = \frac{x_2^2}{C_2 - x_2} = \frac{(\alpha_2 C_2)^2}{C_2 - \alpha_2 C_2}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
K_a = \frac{\alpha_2^2 C_2^2}{C_2 (1 - \alpha_2)} = \frac{\alpha_2^2 C_2}{1 - \alpha_2}.
\]

Rearranging for \( C_2 \):

\[
C_2 = \frac{K_a (1 - \alpha_2)}{\alpha_2^2}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( C_2 \)
Substituting \( \alpha_2 = 0.07328 \):

\[
C_2 = \frac{6.71 \times 10^{-4} (1 - 0.07328)}{(0.07328)^2}.
\]

First, compute \( 1 - \alpha_2 = 1 - 0.07328 = 0.92672 \). Then:

\[
C_2 = \frac{6.71 \times 10^{-4} \times 0.92672}{(0.07328)^2}.
\]

Calculate the numerator:

\[
6.71 \times 10^{-4} \times 0.92672 \approx 6.222 \times 10^{-4}.
\]

Calculate the denominator:

\[
(0.07328)^2 \approx 0.005371.
\]

Thus:

\[
C_2 \approx \frac{6.222 \times 10^{-4}}{0.005371} \approx 0.1158 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 4: Dilution Factor \( D \)
The dilution factor is:

\[
D = \frac{C_1}{C_2} = \frac{0.5}{0.1158} \approx 4.31.
\]

### Step 5: Closest Option
The calculated dilution factor \( D \approx 4.31 \) is closest to option **A: 4.13**. Minor discrepancies may arise due to rounding or approximations in the calculations.

**Answer:** A
