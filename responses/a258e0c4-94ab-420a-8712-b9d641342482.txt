Okay, so I've got this algebra problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. The question is: When (x times the square root of x cubed) raised to the fourth power is simplified, what is the exponent of x? The options are from A to J, with numbers like 20, 12, 5, and so on.

Hmm, let's break this down. I remember that when dealing with exponents and radicals, it's helpful to rewrite radicals using fractional exponents. So the square root of something is the same as raising it to the power of 1/2. That might make things easier to handle.

Looking at the expression inside the parentheses first: x multiplied by the square root of x cubed. Let me write that out. So the square root of x^3 is the same as (x^3)^(1/2). Then I multiply that by x. So the expression inside is x * (x^3)^(1/2).

Now, when you have an exponent raised to another exponent, you multiply them. So (x^3)^(1/2) would be x^(3*(1/2)), which simplifies to x^(3/2). So now the expression inside the parentheses becomes x * x^(3/2).

I remember that when you multiply like bases with exponents, you add the exponents. So x is the same as x^1, right? So x^1 multiplied by x^(3/2) would be x^(1 + 3/2). Let me calculate that: 1 is the same as 2/2, so 2/2 + 3/2 equals 5/2. So the expression inside the parentheses simplifies to x^(5/2).

Now, the entire expression is this x^(5/2) raised to the 4th power. So we have (x^(5/2))^4. Again, when you raise a power to a power, you multiply the exponents. So that's x^(5/2 * 4). Let me compute that: 5 times 4 is 20, and 20 divided by 2 is 10. So the exponent here becomes 10. Therefore, the simplified expression is x^10.

Wait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting again: the original expression is (x√(x³))^4. √(x³) is x^(3/2), so x times x^(3/2) is x^(1 + 3/2) = x^(5/2). Then raising that to the 4th power: (x^(5/2))^4 = x^(5/2 *4) = x^(10). Yep, that seems right.

So the exponent of x is 10. Looking back at the options provided, I see option I is 10. So the correct answer should be I.

The expression simplifies to x^10, so the exponent is 10.
