Okay, so I've got this question about evidence law, specifically about hearsay exceptions and admissibility of a statement. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is that Justin's estate is suing Polly for wrongful death. The estate calls Officer Friendly as a witness. Officer Friendly interviewed Polly right after the event and is going to testify that Polly said, "Oops, I was cleaning my pistol and it went off and shot Justin. I sure was negligent!" The question is whether this testimony is admissible.

First, I need to recall the rules about hearsay. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Generally, hearsay is inadmissible unless there's an exception.

Looking at the statement Polly made: she's explaining how the shooting happened and even uses the word "negligent." The officer is testifying about this statement. So, this is hearsay because it's an out-of-court statement being offered to prove that Polly was negligent and that her actions caused Justin's death.

Now, I need to check if any exceptions apply. The options given suggest possible exceptions like admissions by a party, excited utterances, spontaneous statements, etc.

Option A: Admissions by a party. An admission is a statement offered against an opposing party that was made by the party's agent or employee on a matter within their authority. Here, Polly is the defendant, and the statement is hers. So this could be an admission. But wait, in this case, Polly is the defendant, and her statement is being used against her. So yes, that would be an admission by a party opponent. So this might make the statement admissible.

Option C: Spontaneous statement. I think spontaneous statements fall under the excited utterance exception, which is a subset of the present sense impression or under the 'immediate excitement' exception. But I'm not sure if "spontaneous" is the exact term. The excited utterance exception (FRE 803(2)) applies to statements relating to a startling event made while under the stress of the excitement. Polly just caused the event, so she might still be under stress. The statement was made right after the event, so it's likely an excited utterance. So that's another possible exception.

Option G: Excited utterance. Yes, same as above. So if the statement qualifies under 803(2), then it's admissible.

So which exception applies here? Polly made the statement right after the event, which would mean it's under the stress of the excitement. So it's an excited utterance, making it admissible under 803(2).

Wait, but is the statement being offered for a purpose other than the truth? Like, is it being used to show Polly's state of mind? No, the statement is being offered to prove that she was negligent and that her actions caused the death. So it's for the truth, which makes it hearsay, but the exception would cover that.

Now looking at the options, both A and G could be correct. But wait, the statement is being offered by the plaintiff's side. Polly is the defendant, so her statement is an admission by a party opponent. Admissions are a type of hearsay exception (FRE 801(d)(2)). So under 801(d)(2), a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against an opposing party and was made by the party's agent or employee on a matter within their authority.

So Polly's statement, being her own statement, is an admission by a party opponent. That would make it admissible. So option A says yes, admission by party.

But wait, the statement includes "I sure was negligent." That's a conclusion. Does that affect admissibility? Admissions can include statements of opinion if they are made by the party. So even if she used the word "negligent," that's her own statement, so it's admissible as an admission.

But let me check if there are any other exceptions. The excited utterance is another possible route. So the statement could be admissible under both the admission exception and the excited utterance exception. But since it's an admission, it's definitely admissible.

Looking back at the options, A says yes, admission by party. G says yes, excited utterance. So both A and G would make the testimony admissible. But the question is whether the statement is admissible, so either could be correct.

Wait, but the question is whether it's admissible. So if both apply, any of the correct options would make it admissible. But looking at the options, the correct answer would be either A or G.

But the options are A and G. Let's see the options again.

Options:

A: Yes, admission by party.

G: Yes, because it's an excited utterance.

So both A and G are possible. But in this case, Polly is the defendant, so the statement is an admission by a party opponent, making it admissible under 801(d)(2). So A is correct.

But wait, the statement was made right after the event. So it's also an excited utterance. So maybe both apply, but the primary reason would be that it's an admission. But the question is whether the testimony is admissible, so both A and G could be correct. But looking at the options, the answer may be A because it's an admission.

Wait, but in the scenario, the officer is testifying about what Polly said. If it's an admission, then yes, it's admissible. So the correct answer is A: Yes, admission by party.

Alternatively, if the statement is not an admission, then G would apply. But since Polly is the defendant, her statement is an admission, so A is correct.

But wait, another angle: sometimes, statements made by a party-opponent can be admitted regardless of whether they are excited utterances. So in this case, the statement is both an admission and an excited utterance. But since it's an admission, it's admissible under 801(d)(2), making option A correct.

Alternatively, if the statement was made by a non-party, then excited utterance would apply, but here, Polly is the party, so admission applies.

So the answer should be A: Yes, admission by party.
</think>

The statement made by Polly is admissible because it qualifies as an admission by a party opponent under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2). Polly is the defendant, and her statement is being offered against her by the plaintiff's estate. Since the statement was made by Polly, a party to the case, it falls under the admission exception to hearsay. Additionally, the statement was made immediately after the event, which could also make it an excited utterance under Rule 803(2), but the primary reason for admissibility here is the admission exception.

Answer: A
