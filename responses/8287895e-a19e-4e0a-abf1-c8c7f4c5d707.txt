Okay, so I've got this motor problem to solve. Let me read through it again carefully. The question is about determining the speed of a motor under certain conditions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on motor calculations, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem states that the armature resistance is 0.1 ohms. When connected to an 110-volt mains supply, the armature takes 20 amps and runs at 1200 rpm. Now, the question is asking what the speed would be when the armature takes 50 amps from the same mains, but with the field increased by 10 percent.

Wait, so first, I think I should recall the basic principles of motors, especially DC motors since the term "armature" is used. In DC motors, the speed is related to the applied voltage and the field flux. The formula I remember is something like V = (P * ω * A) / (k * φ), where V is voltage, P is the number of poles, ω is the angular velocity, A is the armature current, k is a constant, and φ is the flux per pole. Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of the speed equation.

Wait, another approach: For a DC motor, the speed is given by V = (PφN)/60, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the speed can be expressed as V divided by (k * Ia), where Ia is the armature current, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the torque and power equations.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of the motor's speed being inversely proportional to the armature current when the voltage and field are constant. But wait, in this problem, the field is changed, so that might affect things.

Let me try to structure this. First, I'll note down the given data:

- Armature resistance (Ra) = 0.1 ohms
- Applied voltage (V) = 110 volts
- First case: Armature current (Ia1) = 20 A, Speed (N1) = 1200 rpm
- Second case: Armature current (Ia2) = 50 A, Field increased by 10% → so the flux is increased by 10%.

I need to find the speed N2 in the second case.

Wait, so the field is increased by 10%. In a motor, the field flux (φ) is typically proportional to the field current, which is usually a separate excitation. If the field is increased by 10%, then φ2 = 1.1 * φ1.

But wait, in a shunt motor, the field current is determined by the voltage across the field circuit, which is the same as the armature voltage if it's a shunt connection. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify whether it's a shunt or series motor. Hmm, that's a problem. Oh, well, maybe the problem assumes a shunt motor since it mentions the field being increased, which is more common in shunt motors. Alternatively, perhaps it's a separately excited motor. Either way, for the sake of this problem, I'll assume that the field flux is directly proportional to the field current, and since the field is increased by 10%, the flux increases by 10%.

So, moving on. The speed of a motor is given by the formula:

N = (V - Ia * Ra) / (k * φ)

Where:
- N is the speed in rpm
- V is the applied voltage
- Ia is the armature current
- Ra is the armature resistance
- k is a constant that includes the number of poles and other factors, but since it's a constant, we can treat it as a proportionality factor.

Wait, but in the initial case, using this formula, we can find the constant kφ, and then use it in the second case.

So, let's write the equation for the first case:

N1 = (V - Ia1 * Ra) / (k * φ1)

Similarly, for the second case:

N2 = (V - Ia2 * Ra) / (k * φ2)

But since φ2 = 1.1 * φ1, we can write N2 as:

N2 = (V - Ia2 * Ra) / (k * 1.1 * φ1 )

But from the first equation, we can express (k * φ1) as (V - Ia1 * Ra) / N1.

Wait, let me rearrange the first equation:

k * φ1 = (V - Ia1 * Ra) / N1

Substituting into the second equation's denominator:

N2 = (V - Ia2 * Ra) / ( (V - Ia1 * Ra) / N1 * 1.1 )

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can express N2 in terms of N1.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the torque equation and see if that helps. But no, maybe sticking with the speed equation is better.

Let me compute the values step by step.

First, compute the voltage drop in the armature for both cases.

In the first case, Ia1 = 20 A, Ra = 0.1 ohms.

So voltage drop Vdrop1 = Ia1 * Ra = 20 * 0.1 = 2 volts.

So the effective voltage across the motor (the part that contributes to speed) would be V - Vdrop1 = 110 - 2 = 108 volts.

Similarly, in the second case, Ia2 = 50 A, so Vdrop2 = 50 * 0.1 = 5 volts.

So effective voltage V' = 110 - 5 = 105 volts.

Now, the speed is proportional to the effective voltage and inversely proportional to the flux.

So, N ∝ (V') / φ.

In the first case, N1 = 1200 rpm corresponds to V'1 = 108 volts and φ1.

In the second case, V'2 = 105 volts and φ2 = 1.1 * φ1.

So, the ratio N2/N1 = (V'2 / φ2) / (V'1 / φ1) )

Simplify:

N2 = N1 * (V'2 / φ2) * (φ1 / V'1 )

Which simplifies to:

N2 = N1 * (V'2 / V'1) * (φ1 / φ2 )

Since φ2 = 1.1 φ1, φ1/φ2 = 1/1.1.

So,

N2 = N1 * (V'2 / V'1) * (1/1.1 )

Plugging in the numbers:

V'1 = 108 V, V'2 = 105 V.

So,

N2 = 1200 * (105 / 108) * (1/1.1)

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 105 / 108 is approximately 0.9722.

Then, 1/1.1 is approximately 0.9091.

Multiply them together: 0.9722 * 0.9091 ≈ 0.8813.

Now, multiply by 1200: 1200 * 0.8813 ≈ 1057.56 rpm.

Looking at the options, the closest one is D: 1,061 rpm. Wait, but 1057.56 is about 1058, which isn't exactly an option here. Let me check my calculations again to see if I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let me recalculate 105/108 = 105 ÷ 108.

105 ÷ 108: Let's compute that as a decimal.

108 goes into 105 zero times. So 105.000...

108 goes into 1050 nine times (9*108=972). 1050-972=78.

Bring down a zero: 780.

108 goes into 780 seven times (7*108=756). 780-756=24.

Bring down a zero: 240.

108 goes into 240 two times (2*108=216). 240-216=24.

So, 105/108 ≈ 0.972222... recurring.

Similarly, 1/1.1 = 0.9090909...

Now, multiply these two: 0.972222 * 0.9090909.

Let me compute that:

0.972222 * 0.9090909 ≈ ?

Well, 0.972222 * 0.9090909 ≈ (approx 0.9722 * 0.9091) 

Multiply 0.9722 * 0.9091:

= (1 - 0.0278) * (1 - 0.0909)

= 1 - 0.0278 - 0.0909 + 0.0278*0.0909

But maybe it's easier to compute directly.

0.9722 * 0.9091:

= (9722/10000) * (9091/10000) = (approx) 9722*9091 / 1e8.

But that's getting complicated. Alternatively, let's compute 0.9722 * 0.9091.

0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81

0.9 * 0.0091 = ~0.00819

0.0722 * 0.9 = ~0.06498

0.0722 * 0.0091 ≈ 0.000657

Adding up: 0.81 + 0.00819 = 0.81819; +0.06498 = 0.88317; +0.000657 ≈ 0.883827.

Wait, maybe that's not the right way. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator approach.

Compute 0.9722 * 0.9091:

= 0.9722 * 0.9 + 0.9722 * 0.0091

= 0.87498 + 0.00885562 ≈ 0.88383562.

So approximately 0.8838.

Now, multiply that by 1200:

1200 * 0.8838 ≈ 1060.56.

Hmm, 1060.56 is about 1060.56 rpm.

Looking at the options, option D is 1,061 rpm, which is very close. So I think that's the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the initial approach. Let me think again.

Another approach could be to use the speed equation considering the armature voltage and the flux.

The speed of a DC motor is given by:

N = (V - Ia * Ra) / (k * φ)

Assuming that the motor is a shunt motor, where the field current is determined by the field voltage, which is the same as the armature voltage if it's a separately excited motor. Wait, but in a shunt motor, the field current If is V / Rf, where Rf is the field resistance. But the problem doesn't give Rf, so I think we can't use that approach directly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the field flux is proportional to the field current, and since the field is increased by 10%, the flux increases by 10%, as I did before.

Wait, another thought: The armature voltage is V - Ia * Ra.

In the first case, V'1 = 110 - 20*0.1 = 110 - 2 = 108 V.

In the second case, V'2 = 110 -50 *0.1= 110-5=105 V.

Now, the flux in the second case is 10% higher, so φ2=1.1 φ1.

The speed is proportional to (V')/(φ), so N ∝ V'/φ.

So, N2 = N1 * (V'2 / V'1) * (φ1 / φ2 )

= 1200 * (105/108) * (1/1.1)

Which is what I did earlier, leading to approximately 1060.56 rpm, which rounds to 1061, so option D.

Yes, that seems correct. So the answer should be D: 1,061 rpm.
</think>

The problem involves determining the speed of a motor when the armature current increases from 20 A to 50 A, with the field flux increased by 10%. The motor's armature resistance is 0.1 Ω, and the applied voltage is 110 V. 

First, calculate the voltage drop in the armature for both cases:

- For the first case:  
  \( V_{\text{drop1}} = I_{a1} \times R_a = 20 \times 0.1 = 2 \, \text{V} \)  
  Effective voltage:  
  \( V'1 = 110 - 2 = 108 \, \text{V} \)  

- For the second case:  
  \( V_{\text{drop2}} = I_{a2} \times R_a = 50 \times 0.1 = 5 \, \text{V} \)  
  Effective voltage:  
  \( V'2 = 110 - 5 = 105 \, \text{V} \)  

The speed of a DC motor is proportional to the effective voltage and inversely proportional to the flux (\( \phi \)). Since the field is increased by 10%, the flux in the second case is \( \phi_2 = 1.1 \phi_1 \). Using the speed ratio:  

\[
\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \frac{V'2 / \phi_2}{V'1 / \phi_1} = \frac{V'2}{V'1} \times \frac{\phi_1}{\phi_2}
\]

Substituting the values:  

\[
N_2 = N_1 \times \frac{V'2}{V'1} \times \frac{1}{1.1} = 1200 \times \frac{105}{108} \times \frac{1}{1.1}
\]

Calculating step-by-step:  

1. \( \frac{105}{108} \approx 0.9722 \)  
2. \( \frac{1}{1.1} \approx 0.9091 \)  
3. \( N_2 \approx 1200 \times 0.9722 \times 0.9091 \approx 1060.56 \, \text{rpm} \)  

The closest option is **1,061 rpm**, corresponding to **D**.
