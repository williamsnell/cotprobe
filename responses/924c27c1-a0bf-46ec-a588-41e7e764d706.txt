Question:

Brood parasites such as the cuckoo successfully trick other species of birds into rearing their young by exploiting the host birds' instinctive response to the loud begging cues of a fledgling in their nest. The genes that allow the host bird species to be duped into rearing the cuckoo fledglings to the detriment of their own offspring most likely remain in the gene pool of the population because

Options:

A: the host birds learn from the experience and are less likely to be duped in the future
B: on average, the host birds' response allows them to rear their own young efficiently by feeding only those who indicate they are hungry
C: the cuckoo fledglings share some of their genes with the host birds
D: the cuckoo fledglings contribute to the survival of the host bird species by increasing genetic diversity
E: the maximum fitness of the duped bird is not compromised when the bird rears an interloper of another species
F: the maximum fitness of the cuckoo would then be reduced
G: on average, little energy is spent on rearing a fledgling bird, whether it is an interloper or one's own
H: the cuckoo fledglings help to protect the nest from predators
I: the genes that allow the host birds to be duped are necessary for the survival of the cuckoo species

Okay, so I've got this biology question about brood parasites, specifically the cuckoo. The question is about why the genes that make host birds get duped into rearing cuckoo chicks stay in the gene pool. Hmm, I remember that brood parasites like cuckoos lay their eggs in other birds' nests. The host birds then raise the cuckoo's chicks as their own.

The question is asking why those genes don't get selected against. If the host birds are raising another species' chicks, their own offspring might not get as much attention, which could be bad for their own fitness. But the gene for being duped is still in the population, so why?

Looking at the options:

A: Host birds learn and are less likely to be duped. I don't think so. If the birds learned and avoided being duped, then the genes for being tricked wouldn't be passed on as much. But the question suggests these genes do remain, so maybe this isn't the reason.

B: Host birds' response allows efficient rearing of their own by feeding only hungry ones. Wait, but the cuckoo chicks trick them into feeding more. If the host birds are good at recognizing their own chicks, maybe they can tell when a cuckoo is present. But the question is why the genes that allow being duped stay. Maybe if those genes are good for rearing their own, they stay.

C: Cuckoo fledglings share some genes with host birds. I don't think that's right. Cuckoos and their hosts are different species, so they don't share genes. Maybe if they were closely related, but I don't think that's the case.

D: Cuckoos increase genetic diversity. Not sure. I don't think the host benefits genetically from the cuckoo's presence. It seems like the host's own offspring are at a disadvantage.

E: Duped bird's fitness isn't compromised. If the host raises a cuckoo, maybe it doesn't affect their own fitness too much. Like, if they have enough resources, they can raise their own and the cuckoo's. Or maybe raising an extra doesn't hurt them much, so their fitness isn't compromised, so the gene stays.

F: Cuckoo's fitness would be reduced. But the cuckoo is the parasite, so their fitness is high because they're exploiting others. Not sure how this ties in.

G: Little energy is spent rearing any fledgling. If it doesn't cost much, then raising a cuckoo doesn't impact the host much. Maybe because the energy isn't that big a cost, the gene sticks around.

H: Cuckoo fledglings protect the nest. I don't recall that being a reason. The main thing is the parents feeding the chicks, not protection.

I: Those genes are necessary for cuckoo survival. That doesn't make sense. The cuckoo's survival depends on the host's genes, but the host's genes allowing being duped would be the ones in question.

So, thinking about why the gene persists. If the cost is low, the gene doesn't get selected against. So option E says the host's fitness isn't compromised. Or G says little energy is spent, so it's not a big cost.

Alternatively, if the host's ability to respond to begging is good for their own chicks, then the gene is maintained because it's beneficial. Like option B says the host's response allows efficient rearing by feeding only those that are hungry. But wait, the cuckoo's chick mimics the host's chicks, so the host can't tell the difference. So if the host is good at rearing their own, maybe it's because the genes help them raise their own, but the cuckoo tricks them.

Wait, but the question is about why the genes that allow the host to be duped remain. So if the genes are helpful for their own rearing, they might stay. Or if the cost isn't too high.

Another angle: if the cuckoo's strategy is so effective, maybe the host's ability to detect and reject the cuckoo's eggs isn't strong. But the question is about why the genes allowing the host to be duped are maintained. So perhaps because the cost isn't high enough to remove the gene from the population. So if the host doesn't lose much by raising the cuckoo, their fitness isn't reduced enough for the gene to be selected against.

Option E says the host's maximum fitness isn't compromised when rearing an interloper. That could mean that even if they're raising a cuckoo, their own fitness isn't bad enough to make the gene unfavorable.

Alternatively, option B suggests that the host's response is efficient for their own young, so the gene is maintained because it's good for their own rearing. But the question is about why the genes that allow being duped are maintained, not the ones that help them detect.

Wait, the genes that make them get duped are the ones we're focusing on. So if the cost is low, they remain. So if the host can raise both their own and the cuckoo's, their own fitness isn't too hurt, so the gene stays.

Alternatively, maybe the gene that makes them respond to the begging is so good for their own reproduction that it's maintained despite being exploited. So perhaps it's a trade-off.

But the options are a bit tricky. Let me think again. The question is about why the genes that allow being duped remain. So the genes are not necessarily beneficial, but they don't get selected against.

If the cost of being duped isn't too high, the gene persists. So if the host's fitness isn't compromised much, the gene doesn't get selected against. That would support option E.

Alternatively, option G says that little energy is spent, so it's not a big deal. If rearing a fledgling, whether own or cuckoo, doesn't cost much, then the gene remains because the cost is low.

But I think the main reason is that the cost to the host isn't so severe that their fitness is compromised. So the gene isn't selected against because the benefit of the gene (efficient rearing of their own) outweighs the cost of sometimes raising a cuckoo.

Wait, but the question says "to the detriment of their own offspring." So the host's own offspring are at a disadvantage. So why doesn't the gene get selected against?

Maybe because the alternative is worse, or because the cost isn't high enough. Or perhaps the host can't do much about it because the cuckoo's strategy is so effective.

Alternatively, maybe the cuckoo's strategy is a form of an evolutionary arms race. But the question is about why the genes that allow the host to be duped remain.

I think the correct answer is E: the maximum fitness of the duped bird isn't compromised when rearing an interloper. Or perhaps G: little energy is spent.

Wait, another thought: if the host bird's instinct is to respond to the begging, and that instinct helps them raise their own chicks effectively, then the gene remains because it's beneficial. So the gene isn't bad; it's just being exploited by the cuckoo. So the gene is maintained because it's good for the host's own reproduction, even though it's sometimes exploited.

So looking at the options, option B says that on average, the host's response allows them to rear their own efficiently by feeding only hungry ones. So the gene is maintained because it's good for their own rearing, even though occasionally it's exploited.

But the question is about why the genes allowing the host to be duped remain. So if the gene is actually beneficial for rearing their own, then it's maintained despite occasional exploitation.

Alternatively, if the gene that makes them duped is not too costly, perhaps because the cuckoo's presence doesn't reduce their own fitness enough, the gene remains.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of it in terms of evolutionary genetics. If a gene causes a behavior that sometimes is bad (being duped), but on average isn't too bad, the gene can remain in the gene pool.

In this case, the host's genes make them respond to the begging, which helps them rear their own chicks. The cuckoo just sometimes takes advantage of that. So the gene isn't selected against because the overall benefit (raising their own) outweighs the cost (occasional cuckoo). So option B might be the right answer.

But the question is phrased as why the genes that allow being duped remain. So perhaps it's because the host's ability to respond to the cues (like loud begging) is actually beneficial for their own offspring, so the gene is maintained despite occasional exploitation.

Alternatively, the cost is low, so the gene isn't selected against. So options E or G.

Hmm. I'm a bit torn between B and E.

Wait, the question says that the host's instinct is to respond to the cues, which allows the cuckoo to exploit them. The genes that allow this are the ones we're considering. So why don't those genes get selected against?

If the genes are good for the host's own reproduction, then they're maintained. So option B says that the host's response allows them to rear their own efficiently. So the gene is maintained because it's beneficial for their own offspring, not because the cost is low.

Alternatively, if the cost is low, the gene doesn't get selected against. So option E says that the host's fitness isn't compromised when rearing an interloper. That would mean the gene isn't bad for the host, so it stays.

I think the correct answer is E. Because if the host's fitness isn't compromised, the gene doesn't get selected against. So even though they're raising a cuckoo, their own fitness isn't bad enough to remove the gene from the population.

The question asks why the genes that allow host birds to be duped by cuckoo parasites remain in the gene pool. Brood parasites like cuckoos exploit the host birds' instinctive response to begging cues, leading to the host rearing the cuckoo's offspring at the expense of their own. Despite this, the genes enabling this exploitation persist in the population.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Host birds learning to avoid being duped would reduce the persistence of these genes, but the question assumes these genes remain, making this option unlikely.
- **B**: The host's ability to rear their own young efficiently by feeding only hungry chicks could maintain the gene, but the question focuses on why the genes allowing exploitation persist, not the benefits of the gene for rearing own offspring.
- **C**: Cuckoo and host birds are different species, so they do not share genes, making this option incorrect.
- **D**: Cuckoo fledglings do not contribute to the host's genetic diversity, so this is unlikely.
- **E**: If the host's fitness is not significantly compromised by rearing a cuckoo, the gene remains in the gene pool. This aligns with the idea that the cost of exploitation is low enough to allow the gene to persist.
- **F**: The cuckoo's fitness is enhanced by exploiting hosts, not reduced, so this option is incorrect.
- **G**: If rearing a fledgling, whether own or cuckoo, is energetically inexpensive, the gene might persist. However, this explanation is less direct than option E.
- **H**: Cuckoo fledglings do not protect nests from predators, so this is incorrect.
- **I**: The persistence of the gene is not about its necessity for cuckoo survival but its presence in the host population.

The most plausible explanation is **E**, as the host's fitness is not significantly compromised by rearing a cuckoo, allowing the gene to remain in the population despite occasional exploitation.
