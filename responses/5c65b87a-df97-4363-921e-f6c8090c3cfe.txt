Okay, so I've got this math problem here asking for the value of 28 multiplied by 42. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit nervous because I sometimes get mixed up with larger numbers, but I'll take it step by step.

First, I remember that multiplying two numbers can be broken down using the distributive property. Maybe I can split 42 into 40 and 2. So, 28 times 40 and 28 times 2, then add them together. That might make it easier.

Let me start with 28 times 40. Well, 28 times 4 is 112, right? Because 28 times 4 is like adding 28 four times: 28 + 28 is 56, plus another 28 is 84, plus another 28 is 112. So, 28 times 4 is 112. Now, since 40 is 4 times 10, I can just add a zero to 112, making it 1120.

Next, I'll calculate 28 times 2. That's straightforward: 28 times 2 is 56. 

Now, I need to add those two results together: 1120 plus 56. Let me add the ones place first: 0 plus 6 is 6. Then the tens place: 2 plus 5 is 7. Then the hundreds place: 1 plus 0 is 1. So, adding them gives me 1176.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to calculate 28 times 42 is to use the standard multiplication method. Let's try that.

I'll write 28 on top and 42 below. Multiply 28 by 2 first, which is 56. Then, multiply 28 by 40, which is 1120. Adding those together gives 56 + 1120 = 1176. Yep, same result.

I think that's correct. Let me look at the options again. Option F is 1,176, which matches my calculation. So the answer should be F.

The value of 28 multiplied by 42 is calculated by breaking it down into smaller parts. Using the distributive property, 28 × 42 = (28 × 40) + (28 × 2) = 1120 + 56 = 1176. Therefore, the correct answer is F.

F: 1,176
