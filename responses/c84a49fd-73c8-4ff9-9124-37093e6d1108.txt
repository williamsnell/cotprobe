Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the number of children between the ages of 5-14 who were working globally as of 2012. The options are A through J, with numbers ranging from 5 million up to 1 billion. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that child labor is a significant issue globally. I think the numbers are in the tens of millions, but I'm not exactly sure. Let me think about what I know from reports or statistics. I recall that the International Labour Organization (ILO) has data on child labor. 

I think the ILO defines child labor as work that interferes with a child's education or development. So, it's not just any work but work that's harmful or exploitative. The ILO has been tracking this for years, and I believe the numbers have been decreasing, but it's still a major problem.

In 2012, I'm trying to remember if the number was around 150 million or maybe 100 million. I think it was 150 million, but I'm not certain. Wait, let me think again. I remember reading that around 2012, the estimate was that about 150 million children were engaged in child labor. That seems high, but considering the global population, it might make sense.

Looking at the options, D is 150 million, E is 75 million, so D is double E. I think the correct number is higher than 75 million. The other options don't seem to fit. For example, 200 million is option G, but I'm pretty sure it's not that high. 100 million is H, which is lower than what I remember.

Another way to approach this is to think about the context. The 5-14 age group is a significant portion of the child population. If the number were 150 million, that would imply a substantial portion of children in that age range are working, which aligns with what I know about global child labor statistics.

I also remember that in some reports, the number was in the hundreds of millions, but I think 150 million is the specific figure from around 2012. So, putting it all together, I think the answer is D: 150 million.

The correct answer is D: 150 million.
