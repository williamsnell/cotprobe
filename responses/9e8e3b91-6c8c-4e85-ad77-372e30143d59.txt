Question:

A husband and wife were about to leave on vacation for one month. They thought it would be a great idea to have new carpeting installed in their home while they were away. They contacted a reputable carpeting company, which offered to do the job for $7,000. The husband and wife agreed, gave a set of house keys to the carpeting company, and left on vacation. A week later, the carpeting company discovered that they had overbooked their installation staff and could not finish all of the jobs for which they had contracted. The carpeting company contacted a workman whom they had used before, and told him about the job they were to perform for the husband and wife. The workman agreed to do the installation in exchange for the payment from the husband and wife. When the husband and wife returned from vacation, they were happy with the work and sent a check for $7,000 to the carpeting company, which deposited the check. If the workman now seeks to recover for services he performed, he will

Options:

A: not recover, because he agreed to perform the services without a direct contract with the husband and wife.
B: recover against the husband and wife only.
C: not recover, because the carpeting company already received payment.
D: recover against the carpeting company only.
E: not recover, because he did not have a written contract.
F: recover against the carpeting company, because they were the ones who contracted him.
G: recover against the husband and wife, because they were the ultimate beneficiaries of his work.
H: not recover, because he was not in privity of contract.
I: recover against both the husband and wife and the carpeting company.
J: recover against either the husband and wife or the carpeting company.

Okay, so I have this question about contract law, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it carefully and think through it step by step.

Alright, the setup is that a husband and wife hired a reputable carpeting company to install new carpeting while they were on vacation. They agreed to pay $7,000, gave the company keys, and left. A week later, the carpeting company found they were overbooked and couldn't finish all their jobs. So they contacted a workman they had used before and told him about the job. The workman agreed to do the installation and would be paid by the husband and wife. When the couple returned, they were happy with the work and sent a check for $7k to the carpeting company, which was deposited.

Now, the question is whether the workman can recover for the services he performed. The options are A through J.

Hmm. So, the key here is about who is liable to pay the workman. Let's break it down.

First, the husband and wife contracted with the carpeting company, not the workman. The carpeting company assigned or subcontracted the work to the workman. But wait, did they have a contract with him? The workman agreed to do the installation in exchange for payment from the husband and wife. So, the workman was probably expecting to be paid directly by the couple.

But in the scenario, the couple sent the payment to the carpeting company, which accepted it. So, the carpeting company received the $7k, but the workman did the work. Now he wants to be paid.

In contract law, when a subcontractor or someone else does work under a contract, the general rule is that the subcontractor can only recover from the party they have a contract with. Here, the workman didn't have a contract with the couple; he had a contract with the carpeting company. Wait, no—wait, the question says the workman agreed to do the installation in exchange for payment from the husband and wife. So he was supposed to be paid by them.

But the couple paid the carpeting company instead. So, the carpeting company got the money, but the workman did the work. Now, the workman wants to recover from someone.

I think this is about privity of contract. The workman didn't have a direct contract with the couple; he was contracted by the carpeting company, but the payment was to come from the couple. Wait, no, the way it's worded is that the workman agreed to perform the services in exchange for payment from the husband and wife. So perhaps the workman had a contract with the husband and wife, but the carpeting company was the one to assign the work. Wait, no, the carpeting company told the workman about the job and he agreed to do it, but the payment was to come from the husband and wife. So, did the workman have a direct contract with the couple?

Alternatively, maybe the workman was acting as an independent contractor for the carpeting company, and the carpeting company was supposed to pay him, but instead, the couple paid the company. But the question says the workman agreed to perform in exchange for payment from the couple. So perhaps the workman had a direct agreement with the couple, but the carpeting company facilitated it.

Wait, but the couple paid the carpeting company. So, the carpeting company received the payment, but the workman did the work. Now the workman is trying to get paid.

I think the issue here is whether the workman can sue the couple or the carpeting company. Since the workman was supposed to be paid by the couple, but they paid the carpeting company, who is responsible.

In contract law, if a third party (like the workman) provides services to the principal (the couple), the principal is generally not liable to the third party unless they have a contract with them. So, the workman didn't have a contract with the couple, so he can't recover from them. Alternatively, if the workman had a contract with the carpeting company, then he can recover from them, but in this case, the payment was supposed to come from the couple.

Wait, but the question says the workman agreed to perform in exchange for payment from the husband and wife. So, did they have a contract? Or was it an assignment?

Wait, maybe the carpeting company assigned their obligation to pay the workman to the couple. But that would require the couple's agreement, which isn't mentioned here. So, the couple didn't agree to pay the workman directly; they paid the carpeting company.

So, the workman was supposed to be paid by the couple, but they didn't pay him directly. Instead, they paid the carpeting company. So, the carpeting company received the money, but the workman did the work.

Now, can the workman sue the carpeting company? If the workman was an independent contractor of the carpeting company, then the carpeting company would be responsible for paying him, but if the couple paid the company, does that affect the workman's claim?

Alternatively, if the workman had a direct contract with the couple, then the couple would owe him, but they paid the company instead. But I think the key here is privity of contract. The workman can only recover from someone he has a contract with.

If the workman only had a contract with the carpeting company, then he can recover from them, regardless of whether the couple paid. But the scenario says the workman agreed to be paid by the couple, which suggests that the carpeting company might have assigned their payment obligation to the couple, but that's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the workman didn't have a contract with either. Wait, no, he agreed to perform the services in exchange for payment from the couple, so he had a contract with them. But the couple paid the company, not him.

Wait, but if the workman has a contract with the couple, he can sue them for the payment. But the couple might argue that they already paid the carpeting company, so they’re not liable. But in contract law, if the couple contracted with the workman, they are responsible for payment, regardless of who else they might have paid.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The main points:

1. The couple contracted with the carpeting company for $7k.
2. The carpeting company subcontracted the work to the workman, who agreed to do it in exchange for payment from the couple.
3. The couple paid the carpeting company, which kept the money.

So, the workman did the work, but the couple paid the company. Now, the workman wants to be paid.

In this case, the workman has a contract with the couple, right? Because he agreed to do the work for them. So, the couple is liable to pay him. But wait, the couple might say they already paid the carpeting company, so they’re not liable. But in contract law, if you have a contract, you can't just pay a third party and be off the hook unless the contract allows for that.

Alternatively, the workman might have a claim against the carpeting company if they didn't pay him. But the question is whether he can recover from either.

Looking at the options:

A: Not recover because no direct contract. But he did have a contract with the couple, so A might not be correct.

B: Recover against the couple only. That's possible.

C: Not recover because the company got paid. But the company is a third party; the couple's payment doesn't affect the workman's claim against them.

D: Recover against the company only. If the workman had a contract with the company, but the scenario says he agreed to be paid by the couple.

E: Not recover because no written contract. But oral contracts are generally enforceable unless under specific laws, so E is probably wrong.

F: Recover against the company because they contracted him. But if the payment was from the couple, maybe not.

G: Recover against the couple because they were the beneficiaries. But I think privity is needed unless it's a third-party beneficiary situation.

Wait, third-party beneficiary! Oh right, that's a key point. The couple might be third-party beneficiaries of the contract between the carpeting company and the workman. But in this case, the workman agreed to be paid by the couple, so it's more like the couple is the obligee. Wait, no, the couple contracted with the carpeting company, and the workman was a subcontractor. So the couple is the intended third-party beneficiary of the carpeting company's contract with the workman.

But in that case, the workman can sue the couple directly because they are the third-party beneficiaries. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Third-party beneficiary rights usually require that the third party knows about the contract and that it was intended for their benefit. But if the workman agreed to be paid by the couple, perhaps the couple is the direct obligor.

Alternatively, maybe the workman can't sue the couple because he didn't have a contract with them, but that's not the case because he agreed to perform in exchange for their payment.

Wait, the workman's agreement was to perform for the couple, so he had a direct contract with them. So, he can sue them for the payment. But the couple might argue that they already paid the carpeting company, so they're not liable. But in contract law, the payment to a third party doesn't discharge the couple's obligation unless the contract allows for it.

Alternatively, maybe the carpeting company is liable to the workman because they subcontracted the work and didn't pay him. But the company received payment from the couple, so maybe they can pay the workman from that.

But the question is whether the workman can recover from either party.

Looking at the options again:

Option D says he can recover against the carpeting company only.

Option G says he can recover against the couple because they were the ultimate beneficiaries.

Option H says he can't recover because he wasn't in privity.

Wait, the workman was in privity with the couple because he had a contract with them. So H might not apply.

But wait, the workman was contracted by the carpeting company, but the payment was from the couple. So perhaps the workman's contract is with the carpeting company, and the couple is a third party.

I think I'm getting tangled here. Let me think of it another way. Suppose you agree to do work for someone else's client. If the main contractor gets paid by the client, but doesn't pay you, can you sue the client?

In some cases, yes, if you're a third-party beneficiary. But in others, you can't because you're not in privity with the client.

Wait, in this scenario, the workman agreed to perform the services in exchange for payment from the husband and wife. So, that sounds like a direct contract between the workman and the couple. So, the workman can sue the couple for the payment. But the couple might say they already paid the carpeting company. But in contract law, if you have a contract, paying a third party doesn't discharge your obligation unless the contract allows it.

Alternatively, if the workman didn't have a direct contract with the couple, but only with the carpeting company, then he can only sue the carpeting company. But the question says he agreed to be paid by the couple, which suggests a direct contract.

So, the workman can recover against the couple. But looking at the options, option B says he can recover against the husband and wife only. But wait, the carpeting company might also be liable if they didn't pay him, regardless of whether the couple paid.

Wait, but the carpeting company received the payment and presumably should have paid the workman. So, the workman can sue the carpeting company for the payment because they contracted him and received the money.

But the couple also might owe him because they have a contract with him.

Wait, that can't be right because if both are liable, that would be unusual. Typically, in such scenarios, the subcontractor can only recover from the general contractor if the general contractor is responsible for paying the subcontractor. Alternatively, the subcontractor can sue the owner if they are a third-party beneficiary.

But in this case, the workman's contract was with the couple, so he can recover from them. The carpeting company also might have a duty to pay him, but if they didn't, he can sue them as well.

Wait, but the couple paid the carpeting company, so the carpeting company is in a position to pay the workman. So, the workman can sue the carpeting company for the money, as they received payment from the couple but didn't pass it on to him.

Alternatively, the workman can sue the couple directly because they contracted with him. So, he has two potential claims: one against the couple for breach of contract, and one against the carpeting company for not paying him despite receiving the payment.

But looking at the options, option I says he can recover against both. But I don't think that's correct because typically, the subcontractor can only recover from the general contractor, and the owner isn't liable unless they have a direct contract.

Wait, but in this case, the workman had a direct contract with the couple, so he can sue them. The carpeting company also owes him because they hired him and received the payment. So, both could be liable.

But looking at the options, I don't see an option that says both. Let me check the options again.

Options:

I: Recover against both the husband and wife and the carpeting company.

J: Recover against either the husband and wife or the carpeting company.

So, if the workman can sue both, then I would be the answer. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, maybe only one is liable. Let's think again.

If the workman had a direct contract with the couple, he can sue them. If the couple paid the carpeting company, the workman can also sue the carpeting company because they didn't pay him. So, both could be liable.

But in reality, the workman would probably choose to sue the carpeting company because they have the money, but legally, he might have a claim against both.

So, looking back at the options, option I says he can recover against both. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, option J says he can recover against either one, which is the idea of joint and several liability, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the workman agreed to be paid by the couple, so he has a direct contract with them. Therefore, he can sue them. Additionally, the carpeting company, having contracted him and received the payment, might be liable to him as well. So, he can sue both.

But I'm not entirely certain. Another angle: the husband and wife are the principals, and the carpeting company is their contractor. The workman is a subcontractor. Typically, the subcontractor can only recover from the general contractor, not the principal, unless there's a direct contract.

But in this case, the workman had a direct contract with the couple, so he can sue them. So, he can recover against the couple, and perhaps also against the carpeting company if they didn't pay him.

But looking at the options, the possible answers are A through J.

Option D says he can recover against the carpeting company only. But if he has a contract with the couple, he can also recover from them.

Wait, but the question says the workman now seeks to recover. The couple paid the carpeting company, which kept the money. The workman did the work but wasn't paid. So, he can sue the carpeting company for the money because they received it but didn't pay him. He can also sue the couple because they have a contract with him.

But in reality, the couple would say they already paid, so they're not liable. But in contract law, paying a third party doesn't discharge your obligation unless the contract allows it.

So, the workman can sue both. Therefore, option I would be correct. But looking at the options, option I is "recover against both the husband and wife and the carpeting company."

But I'm not sure if the workman can sue both. Alternatively, maybe only the carpeting company is liable because they received the payment and didn't pay the workman.

Wait, but the workman's contract was with the couple, so they are directly liable. The carpeting company is liable as well if they didn't pay him. So, he can sue both.

But I'm not certain. Another approach: the workman is in privity with the couple, so he can sue them. The carpeting company is in privity with the workman as well, so he can sue them too. Therefore, he can recover from both.

But looking at the options, option I is the only one that allows recovery against both. Alternatively, option J says he can recover against either, which is also possible if they are jointly liable.

But I think the correct answer is that the workman can recover against the carpeting company only because the payment was made to them, and they should have paid the workman. Alternatively, if he has a contract with the couple, he can also recover from them.

Wait, but the couple didn't pay him directly. So, perhaps the workman can only recover from the carpeting company, as they received the payment and should have paid him. Alternatively, if he had a direct contract with the couple, he can recover from them.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me recall the rules. In the case of a subcontractor, the subcontractor can usually only recover from the general contractor if the general contractor has breached the contract. The owner is not liable to the subcontractor unless there's a direct contract.

But in this case, the workman agreed to be paid by the couple, so he has a direct contract with them. Therefore, he can sue them. The carpeting company, having received the payment, is also liable to pay him, so he can sue them as well.

Wait, but the couple might argue that they already paid the carpeting company, so they're not liable. But if the workman has a contract with the couple, they are still liable unless they can transfer the obligation, which isn't the case here.

So, the workman can recover from both the couple and the carpeting company. Therefore, option I would be correct.

But looking at the options again, option I is an option. Alternatively, the workman can only recover from the carpeting company because they were the ones who contracted him, but he also has a contract with the couple.

Hmm. I think the correct answer is that the workman can recover against the carpeting company only because the couple's payment to the company doesn't discharge their obligation to the workman, but the workman can also sue the couple. Wait, but the workman's contract was with the couple, so he can sue them. The carpeting company is also liable because they received the money and didn't pay him.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe the answer is D: recover against the carpeting company only. Because the workman's agreement was with the carpeting company, even though the payment was from the couple. Alternatively, the workman had a contract with the couple, so he can sue them.

Wait, the question says the workman agreed to perform in exchange for payment from the husband and wife. So, that's a direct contract between the workman and the couple. Therefore, the workman can sue the couple for the payment. The carpeting company, having received the payment, is also liable to pay the workman, so he can sue them as well.

But looking at the options, the only option that allows recovery against both is I. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, the correct answer is A: not recover because he agreed without a direct contract. But that's not correct because he did have a contract with the couple.

Wait, no, the workman was contracted by the carpeting company, and the payment was from the couple. So, perhaps the workman didn't have a direct contract with the couple, making option A correct. But the question says he agreed to be paid by the couple, which suggests a direct contract.

I think I'm going in circles. Let me try to recall: in third-party beneficiary cases, the subcontractor can usually only recover from the general contractor, not the owner, unless the owner is a third-party beneficiary and the subcontractor can sue them. But here, the workman had a direct contract with the couple, so he can sue them.

Therefore, the workman can recover against the husband and wife because they have a direct contract with him. So, option B would be correct.

But wait, the couple paid the carpeting company, which might mean they're not liable. But in contract law, paying a third party doesn't discharge your own obligation unless the contract allows it. So, the workman can still sue the couple.

So, the answer would be B: recover against the husband and wife only.

Wait, but the carpeting company also received the payment and didn't pay the workman, so the workman can also sue them. Therefore, the correct answer might be I: recover against both.

But I'm not sure. Another perspective: the workman is an independent contractor of the carpeting company. The carpeting company is responsible for paying him. The couple paid the company, so the company is liable to pay the workman. Therefore, the workman can sue the carpeting company.

But the workman also has a contract with the couple, so he can sue them as well. Therefore, he can recover from both.

But looking at the options, I think the answer is D: recover against the carpeting company only. Because the workman's contract was with the carpeting company, and they received the payment. So, they are liable to pay him.

But I'm not entirely confident. I think the correct answer is D.
</think>

The question revolves around whether the workman can recover payment for his services. The key points are:

1. **Contractual Relationships**: The husband and wife (the couple) contracted with the carpeting company for $7,000. The carpeting company subcontracted the work to the workman, who agreed to perform the services in exchange for payment directly from the couple.

2. **Payment Flow**: The couple paid the carpeting company, which deposited the check. The workman did the work but was not paid directly by the couple.

3. **Liability Analysis**:
   - The workman had a direct contract with the couple, as he agreed to perform the services in exchange for their payment. This means the couple is liable to pay him unless they have a valid defense (e.g., payment to a third party does not discharge their obligation unless the contract allows it).
   - The carpeting company, having subcontracted the work and received payment from the couple, is also liable to the workman for payment if they failed to pay him.

4. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect because the workman did have a direct contract with the couple.
   - **Option B**: Partially correct, as the workman can recover from the couple, but the analysis also suggests the carpeting company is liable.
   - **Option D**: Correct, as the carpeting company is directly responsible for paying the workman, having subcontracted the work and received payment.
   - **Option I**: Incorrect because the workman cannot recover from both parties simultaneously; the analysis supports recovery from the carpeting company only.

Given the analysis, the workman can recover against the carpeting company because they subcontracted the work and received payment. 

**Answer: D**
