Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the reflectance for light at a water-glass boundary when the glass is either crown or flint. I remember that reflectance has to do with how much light is reflected when it hits a boundary between two media. 

Wait, the formula for reflectance at normal incidence is given by the Fresnel equations. Since the light is going from water to glass, I need to consider the indices of refraction for both materials. Water has an index of about 1.33, right? And glass here is either crown (n=1.523) or flint (n=1.62). 

The formula for reflectance (R) when moving from medium 1 to medium 2 is R = [(n2 - n1)/(n2 + n1)]². Since the light is going from water (n1=1.33) to glass (n2=1.523 or 1.62), I should plug those values into the formula.

Let me calculate for crown glass first. So n1 is 1.33 and n2 is 1.523. 

Compute (1.523 - 1.33)/(1.523 + 1.33) first. The numerator is 0.193, and the denominator is 2.853. So 0.193 / 2.853 ≈ 0.06766. Then square that: (0.06766)^2 ≈ 0.00457. To get percentage, multiply by 100, which gives about 0.457%. Hmm, but none of the options are exactly 0.45%. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option F is 0.48% for crown. That's close but a bit higher than my calculation. Did I make a mistake? Let me recalculate.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the math. 1.523 minus 1.33 is indeed 0.193. 1.523 plus 1.33 is 2.853. 0.193 divided by 2.853 is approximately 0.06766. Squared is 0.004578, which is about 0.4578%. So 0.458%, which is roughly 0.46%. But the options don't have that. Closest is option F at 0.48% and option E at 0.40%. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should consider whether the glass is on the other side. Oh wait, the question says water-glass boundary, so it's water first, then glass. So n1 is water, n2 is glass. So the formula is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the absolute value, but since n2 is larger than n1, it's positive. So maybe I did it right. Let me think if there's another way. Oh wait, sometimes the formula is written as (n2 - n1)/(n2 + n1), squared, for reflection when moving from medium 1 to medium 2 where n2 > n1. So that's correct.

Maybe I should calculate more accurately. Let's compute 0.193 / 2.853:

0.193 ÷ 2.853. Let me do this division precisely. 2.853 goes into 0.193 how many times? 2.853 * 0.067 is about 0.191. So approximately 0.0676, as before. Squaring that: (0.0676)^2 = (6.76e-2)^2 = 4.57e-3, which is 0.457%. So about 0.46%.

Looking at the options, none have exactly this. Let me see the options again.

Option F: 0.48% for crown. Option E: 0.40%. Hmm. 0.46% is closer to 0.48% than 0.40%, but maybe I should check the calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial subtraction or addition. Let me double-check n2 - n1 and n2 + n1.

n2 (crown) =1.523, n1 (water)=1.33. So 1.523 - 1.33 = 0.193. Correct. 1.523 + 1.33 = 2.853. Correct. So the ratio is 0.193/2.853 ≈ 0.06766.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (n1 - n2)/(n1 + n2) squared, but that would give a negative, but since we square it, the same result. So it doesn't matter.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula for when light goes from a lower index to higher index, which is what's happening here. So R = [(n2 -n1)/(n2 +n1)]². So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of percentage points. 0.457% is approximately 0.46%, which is closer to option F's 0.48%. But maybe I did a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise indices. Wait, water's index is approximately 1.33, but sometimes it's given as 1.331. Let me try that. So n1=1.331, n2=1.523.

n2 - n1 = 1.523 -1.331=0.192. n2 +n1=1.523+1.331=2.854. So 0.192/2.854 ≈ 0.06728. Squared is 0.00453, which is 0.453%. Still around 0.45%, which isn't matching any options exactly.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps option F is 0.48% and option B is 0.56%. Let me check what option B says. Option B is 0.56% for crown and 1.04% for flint. That seems higher than my calculation.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Oh wait, is the formula R = ( (n2 -n1)/(n2 +n1) )² or is it (n1 -n2)/(n1 +n2) )²? Well, it's the same because squaring a negative gives the same result. So it doesn't matter. So the calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the flint glass as well to see if any pattern emerges. So for flint glass, n2=1.62.

n2 -n1 =1.62 -1.33=0.29. n2 +n1=1.62+1.33=2.95. So 0.29/2.95 ≈0.0983. Squared is (0.0983)^2 ≈0.00966, which is 0.966%. So approximately 0.97%.

Looking at the options, option B says 1.04% for flint, option F says 0.98% for flint. So my calculation for flint is about 0.97%, which is close to option F's 0.98%. 

Now, for the crown glass, my calculation is about 0.457%, which is closest to option F's 0.48% (crown) and 0.98% (flint). Alternatively, option B is 0.56 and 1.04, which are a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me recalculate the crown glass.

n2=1.523, n1=1.33.

n2 -n1 = 0.193.

n2 +n1=2.853.

0.193 / 2.853 = let me compute this division more accurately.

2.853 * 0.067 ≈ 0.191, as before. So 0.06766.

(0.06766)^2 = 0.004577, which is 0.4577%, so approximately 0.458%.

Looking at the options, option F is 0.48% and 0.98%. That's about 0.46 and 0.98, which is close. Alternatively, option B is higher: 0.56 and 1.04.

Wait, perhaps I should check using the exact formula again. Alternatively, maybe the indices are different. For example, if water's index is 1.330, then the calculations hold.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is R = (2n1)/(n2 +n1))², but no, that's not right. Wait, the formula for reflection when going from medium 1 to 2 is R = [(n2 -n1)/(n2 +n1)]².

Another approach: perhaps I should compute the reflection when light goes from glass to water, but the question is about light going from water to glass, so n1 is water, n2 is glass.

Wait, maybe I should consider the other way around. For example, when light goes from a medium with lower refractive index to higher, the reflection is given by that formula. So in this case, water (n=1.33) to glass (n=1.523), so n2 >n1, so reflection is as calculated.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is R = (n1 -n2)^2 / (n1 +n2)^2, but that gives the same result as before.

Hmm, perhaps I should look up the standard formula again. The Fresnel reflection coefficient for normal incidence is R = [(n2 -n1)/(n2 +n1)]² when moving from medium 1 to medium 2.

So I think my calculations are correct. So for crown glass, R≈0.457%, and for flint, R≈0.966%, which is about 0.97%.

Looking at the options, option F says 0.48% and 0.98%, which is very close to my calculations. So that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, but option B is 0.56% and 1.04%, which is a bit higher. Let me see if I messed up any numbers.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the flint calculation. n=1.62.

n2 -n1=1.62-1.33=0.29.

n2 +n1=1.62+1.33=2.95.

0.29/2.95=0.0983.

(0.0983)^2=0.00966, which is 0.966%, so about 0.97%.

So option F's 0.98% is very close. So the answer should be option F: 0.48% for crown and 0.98% for flint.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is 0.48% and 0.98%. So that's the correct choice.

To determine the reflectance for light of normal incidence at a water-glass boundary, we use the Fresnel reflection formula:

\[
R = \left( \frac{n_2 - n_1}{n_2 + n_1} \right)^2
\]

Here, \( n_1 \) is the refractive index of water (\( n_1 = 1.33 \)), and \( n_2 \) is the refractive index of the glass. For crown glass, \( n_2 = 1.523 \), and for flint glass, \( n_2 = 1.62 \).

### (a) Crown Glass (\( n_2 = 1.523 \)):
1. Compute \( n_2 - n_1 = 1.523 - 1.33 = 0.193 \).
2. Compute \( n_2 + n_1 = 1.523 + 1.33 = 2.853 \).
3. Calculate the ratio: \( \frac{0.193}{2.853} \approx 0.06766 \).
4. Square the ratio: \( (0.06766)^2 \approx 0.004577 \).
5. Convert to percentage: \( 0.004577 \times 100 \approx 0.457\% \).

This value is closest to **0.48%** for crown glass.

### (b) Flint Glass (\( n_2 = 1.62 \)):
1. Compute \( n_2 - n_1 = 1.62 - 1.33 = 0.29 \).
2. Compute \( n_2 + n_1 = 1.62 + 1.33 = 2.95 \).
3. Calculate the ratio: \( \frac{0.29}{2.95} \approx 0.0983 \).
4. Square the ratio: \( (0.0983)^2 \approx 0.00966 \).
5. Convert to percentage: \( 0.00966 \times 100 \approx 0.966\% \).

This value is closest to **0.98%** for flint glass.

### Conclusion:
The reflectance values are approximately **0.48%** for crown glass and **0.98%** for flint glass, which matches **Option F**.

**Answer: F**
