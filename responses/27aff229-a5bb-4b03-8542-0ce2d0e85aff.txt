Okay, so I have this math problem to solve: 4 ÷ 2 • 2 + 8 − 4. And I need to choose the correct answer from options A to J. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when solving mathematical expressions, I should follow the order of operations, often remembered by PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). Since there are no parentheses or exponents here, I'll start with multiplication and division.

Looking at the expression: 4 ÷ 2 • 2 + 8 − 4.

Let me break it down. The division and multiplication come first. So I'll handle them left to right. 

First step: 4 ÷ 2. That equals 2. So now the expression becomes 2 • 2 + 8 − 4.

Next, I do the multiplication: 2 • 2 equals 4. So now the expression is 4 + 8 − 4.

Now, I handle addition and subtraction from left to right. Start with 4 + 8, which is 12. Then subtract 4 from that: 12 − 4 equals 8.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So 4 divided by 2 is 2, then multiplied by 2 is 4. Then 4 plus 8 is 12, minus 4 is indeed 8. Hmm, but looking at the options, G is 8. But wait, another way to think about it: sometimes people might do multiplication before division, but no, according to PEMDAS, they're at the same level, so left to right.

Wait, let me check the original expression again: 4 ÷ 2 • 2. So it's (4 ÷ 2) * 2, which is 2 * 2 = 4. Then adding 8 gives 12, minus 4 is 8. So yeah, 8 is the result.

But wait, looking at the options, option G is 8. So the answer should be G. But let me make sure I didn't skip anything. Did I handle the operations correctly? Yes, division and multiplication first, left to right, then addition and subtraction left to right. Yep, that seems right.

The value of the expression is 8.

Answer: G
