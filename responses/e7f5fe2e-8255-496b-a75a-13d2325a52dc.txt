Okay, so I've got this problem here about a bicycle's price after a discount. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The original price is $138.00, and it's marked down by 15%. I need to find the new price after this discount.

Hmm, first, I think I should calculate what 15% of $138 is because that's the discount amount. To find a percentage of a number, I know I can multiply the percentage (as a decimal) by that number. So, 15% as a decimal is 0.15. 

Let me do the multiplication: 138 multiplied by 0.15. Let me break it down. 138 * 0.1 is 13.8, and 138 * 0.05 is 6.9. Adding those together, 13.8 + 6.9 equals 20.7. So, the discount is $20.70.

Now, to find the new price after the discount, I subtract the discount from the original price. So, $138.00 minus $20.70. Let's see, 138 minus 20 is 118, and then minus 0.70 would make it 117.30. So the new price should be $117.30.

Looking at the options, option G is $117.30. That must be the correct answer. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 15% of 138 is indeed 20.7, and subtracting that gives 117.30. Yep, that looks right.

The discount is calculated as 15% of $138, which is $20.70. Subtracting this from the original price gives $117.30. 

Answer: G
