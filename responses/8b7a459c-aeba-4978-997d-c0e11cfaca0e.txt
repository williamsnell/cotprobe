Okay, so I have this physics problem about finding the de Broglie wavelength of an electron with different energies. I remember that the de Broglie wavelength is related to the momentum of a particle. The formula I think is lambda equals h over p, where h is Planck's constant and p is momentum. 

But wait, momentum is mass times velocity, right? So p = m*v. But I don't have velocity here, I have kinetic energy. Oh, right, the kinetic energy K is related to momentum by the equation K = p²/(2m), assuming non-relativistic speeds because the question says to neglect relativistic corrections. 

So I can rearrange that to find p. Let's see, p squared equals 2mK, so p = sqrt(2mK). Once I have p, I can plug it into the de Broglie formula.

Planck's constant h is about 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, and the mass of an electron m is 9.109 x 10^-31 kg. 

So the de Broglie wavelength lambda would be h divided by sqrt(2mK). Let me write that down: λ = h / sqrt(2mK).

Wait, but the energies given are in electron volts. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602 x 10^-19 joules. So I need to convert the energy from eV to joules.

Let me tackle each case one by one.

First case: K1 = 1 eV. Let's compute p for this.

K1 = 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So p = sqrt(2 * m * K). 

m = 9.109e-31 kg.

So 2mK = 2 * 9.109e-31 kg * 1.602e-19 J. Let's compute that.

2 * 9.109e-31 = 1.8218e-30. Multiply by 1.602e-19: 1.8218e-30 * 1.602e-19 = 2.918e-49. So sqrt(2.918e-49) = approx 5.4e-25 kg·m/s.

Then lambda = h / p = 6.626e-34 / 5.4e-25. Let's compute that.

6.626e-34 / 5.4e-25 ≈ 1.227e-9 meters, which is 1.227 nanometers, or 12.27 angstroms. Hmm, looking at the options, option G has λ1 = 12.2 A, which is close to this.

But wait, let me double-check my calculation. Maybe I missed a step.

Wait, Planck's constant is 6.626e-34 J·s. Yes. Mass of electron is correct. Oh wait, but when I compute 2mK, I should make sure I'm using the correct units.

Wait another approach: Maybe using a simplified formula that incorporates the conversion from eV to wavelength. I remember there's a formula where wavelength in angstroms is about 12.3 / sqrt(K in eV). Let me check that.

If K is in eV, then λ ≈ 12.3 / sqrt(K) angstroms. So for K=1 eV, λ ≈ 12.3 / 1 = 12.3 A, which aligns with the first part of option G (12.2 A) and option I (13.5) is higher.

Wait, but I need to compute it precisely. Let me redo the calculation.

Compute p = sqrt(2mK).

First, K in joules: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

m = 9.109e-31 kg.

2mK = 2 * 9.109e-31 * 1.602e-19 = 2 * (9.109 *1.602) e-50.

9.109 *1.602 ≈ 14.587, so 2 *14.587 ≈ 29.174, so 2.9174e-49 kg²·m²/s².

p = sqrt(2.9174e-49) ≈ 5.4e-25 kg·m/s, as before.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

λ = 6.626e-34 / 5.4e-25 ≈ 1.227e-9 m = 12.27e-10 m = 12.27 A.

So option G has 12.2 A, which is close enough considering rounding.

Now the second case: K2 = 10^4 eV = 10,000 eV.

Again, K = 10^4 eV = 10^4 * 1.602e-19 J = 1.602e-15 J.

p = sqrt(2mK) = sqrt(2 *9.109e-31 *1.602e-15).

Compute 2*9.109e-31 = 1.8218e-30. Multiply by 1.602e-15: 1.8218e-30 *1.602e-15 = 2.918e-45.

p = sqrt(2.918e-45) ≈ 5.4e-23 kg·m/s.

λ = 6.626e-34 / 5.4e-23 ≈ 1.227e-11 m = 0.1227e-9 m = 0.1227 A, so approximately 0.123 A.

Looking at the options, option G for K2=10^4 eV is 0.122 A, which matches closely.

Third case: K3=10^5 eV = 100,000 eV.

K = 10^5 *1.602e-19 = 1.602e-14 J.

p = sqrt(2mK) = sqrt(2 *9.109e-31 *1.602e-14).

Compute 2 *9.109e-31 = 1.8218e-30. Multiply by 1.602e-14: 1.8218e-30 *1.602e-14 = 2.918e-44.

p = sqrt(2.918e-44) = approx 5.4e-22 kg·m/s.

λ = 6.626e-34 /5.4e-22 ≈ 1.227e-12 m = 0.01227 A = 0.0123 A, which is 0.0123 A or 0.0123 nanometers.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G's third value is 0.039 A, which doesn't match. Hmm, did I make a mistake?

Wait, no, wait: Let me recheck.

Wait, 10^5 eV is 1e5 eV. So K =1e5 eV =1e5 *1.602e-19 =1.602e-14 J.

p = sqrt(2 *9.109e-31 *1.602e-14) = sqrt( (2*9.109 *1.602) e-45 ) 

2 *9.109 ≈ 18.218, 18.218 *1.602 ≈29.18, so sqrt(29.18e-45) = sqrt(2.918e-44) =5.4e-22 kg·m/s.

λ =6.626e-34 /5.4e-22 ≈1.227e-12 m = 0.01227 nm =0.01227 A.

Looking at the options, option G has λ3=0.039 A, which is much larger than my calculation. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, 1e5 eV is 100,000 eV. So K=1e5 eV.

So K in J: 1e5 *1.602e-19 =1.602e-14 J.

p= sqrt(2 * m * K) = sqrt(2 *9.109e-31 *1.602e-14).

Compute 2 *9.109e-31 =1.8218e-30. Multiply by 1.602e-14: 1.8218e-30 *1.602e-14 = 2.918e-44.

p= sqrt(2.918e-44) = approximately 5.4e-22 kg m/s.

λ= h/p =6.626e-34 /5.4e-22 ≈1.227e-12 m =0.01227 A, which is 0.0123 A.

Looking at the options, I don't see any option where K3=1e5 eV gives lambda around 0.0123 A. Option G has 0.039 A, which is higher.

Wait, did I mess up the exponents somewhere? Let me recheck the exponents.

Wait, 1e5 eV is 10^5 eV. So when computing p:

2mK = 2 *9.109e-31 kg *1.602e-14 J.

Multiplying 9.109e-31 by 1.602e-14 gives 1.458e-44. Then 2 *1.458e-44 =2.916e-44. So sqrt(2.916e-44) is 5.4e-22 kg·m/s.

Yes, that's correct. So lambda is 6.626e-34 /5.4e-22 ≈1.227e-12 m =0.01227 A.

Looking at the options, none of them have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe I should use a different approach. I think the de Broglie wavelength can also be calculated using the formula λ = 12.3 / sqrt(K) angstroms when K is in eV. Let me try that.

For K=1eV, λ=12.3/1=12.3 A. That matches option G (12.2 A).

For K=1e4 eV: λ=12.3 / sqrt(1e4) =12.3 /100=0.123 A. Option G says 0.122 A, which is very close.

For K=1e5 eV: sqrt(1e5)=316.227..., so λ=12.3 /316.227 ≈0.0389 A. Hmm, option G says 0.039 A, which matches.

Wait, but earlier when I computed it directly, I got 0.01227 A, but using the formula λ=12.3/sqrt(K), I get 0.0389 A. There's a discrepancy here. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, I think I messed up the K in the second approach. Wait, K is in eV, so for K=1e5 eV, lambda is 12.3/sqrt(1e5) =12.3/(316.228)≈0.0389 A, which is 0.039 A. So option G's third value is 0.039 A, which matches this.

But earlier, when I did the direct calculation, I got 0.01227 A, which is about a third of that. So I must have made a mistake in the direct calculation.

Wait, let me check the direct calculation again.

K3=1e5 eV=1e5 *1.602e-19 =1.602e-14 J.

p= sqrt(2mK) = sqrt(2 *9.109e-31 *1.602e-14).

Compute 2 *9.109e-31 =1.8218e-30.

1.8218e-30 *1.602e-14 = (1.8218 *1.602) e-44 ≈2.918e-44.

sqrt(2.918e-44)=5.4e-22 kg m/s.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

λ=6.626e-34 /5.4e-22 ≈1.227e-12 m =0.01227 A.

Wait, but that's 0.012 A, which is about a third of 0.039 A. So where is the mistake?

Ah! I think I see the problem. The formula λ=12.3/sqrt(K) is correct only when K is in eV and lambda is in angstroms. Wait, but wait, let me recheck the derivation.

The correct formula comes from combining λ = h/(sqrt(2mK)).

h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

So λ = h/(sqrt(2mK)) 

But K is in J. Let me express everything in terms of eV.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the simplified formula where λ (in angstroms) = (12.26)/(sqrt(K in eV)).

Yes, that's a standard approximation. So for K in eV, λ (Å) ≈ 12.26 / sqrt(K).

So for K=1e5 eV, λ ≈12.26/sqrt(1e5) ≈12.26/316.23 ≈0.03876 Å, which is approximately 0.0388 A, matching option G's 0.039 A.

But wait, earlier in the direct calculation, I got 0.01227 A. That's a big discrepancy. So I must have made a mistake in the direct approach.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents when calculating p. Let me try again.

p = sqrt(2mK).

m =9.109e-31 kg.

K=1e5 eV =1e5 *1.602e-19 J=1.602e-14 J.

So 2mK = 2 *9.109e-31 *1.602e-14.

Calculate 9.109e-31 *1.602e-14 = (9.109 *1.602) e-45 ≈14.587e-45 =1.4587e-44.

Multiply by 2: 2.9174e-44.

p = sqrt(2.9174e-44) = sqrt(2.9174) *1e-22 ≈1.708e-22 kg·m/s.

Wait, wait, no: sqrt(2.9174e-44) = sqrt(2.9174) *1e-22 ≈1.708e-22 kg·m/s.

Wait, no, because sqrt(1e-44) is 1e-22. So sqrt(2.9174e-44) = sqrt(2.9174) *1e-22 ≈1.708e-22.

Then lambda = h/p =6.626e-34 /1.708e-22 ≈3.878e-12 m = 0.03878 A, which is about 0.0388 A, matching the formula. So earlier, I must have messed up the calculation of p.

Ah, I see where I went wrong earlier. I thought that sqrt(2.918e-44) was 5.4e-22, but that's incorrect. Let me recalculate sqrt(2.918e-44).

Wait, 2.918e-44 is the same as 2.918 x 1e-44. The square root of 2.918 is about 1.708, and sqrt(1e-44) is 1e-22. So sqrt(2.918e-44)=1.708e-22.

So p=1.708e-22 kg·m/s.

Then lambda =6.626e-34 /1.708e-22 ≈3.878e-12 m = 0.03878 A, which is 0.0388 A, aligning with option G's 0.039 A.

So now everything makes sense. So option G has all three values matching:

K1=1eV → λ=12.2 A,

K2=1e4 eV → λ=0.122 A,

K3=1e5 eV → λ=0.039 A.

Looking at the options, option G is:

G: For K1= 1eV, λ1 = 12.2 A; For K2 = 10^4eV, λ2 = 0.122 A; For K3 = 10^5eV, λ3= 0.039 A.

Yes, that's correct.

The de Broglie wavelength is calculated using the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{\sqrt{2mK}}
\]

where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) is Planck's constant, \( m = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \) is the mass of an electron, and \( K \) is the kinetic energy in joules. Since the kinetic energy is given in electron volts (eV), it is converted to joules using \( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \).

For each case:

1. **\( K_1 = 1 \, \text{eV} \):**
   - \( K = 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)

2. **\( K_2 = 10^4 \, \text{eV} \):**
   - \( K = 10^4 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{J} \)
   - \( p = \sqrt{2mK} = \sqrt{2 \cdot 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \cdot 1.602 \times 10^{-15}} \approx 5.4 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{kg·m/s} \)
   - \( \lambda = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{5.4 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 1.227 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m} = 0.1227 \, \text{Å} \)
   - Matches option G: \( \lambda_2 = 0.122 \, \text{Å} \).

3. **\( K_3 = 10^5 \, \text{eV} \):**
   - \( K = 10^5 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{J} \)
   - \( p = \sqrt{2mK} = \sqrt{2 \cdot 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \cdot 1.602 \times 10^{-14}} \approx 1.708 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{kg·m/s} \)
   - \( \lambda = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{1.708 \times 10^{-22}} \approx 3.878 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{m} = 0.0388 \, \text{Å} \)
   - Matches option G: \( \lambda_3 = 0.039 \, \text{Å} \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**G: For \( K_1 = 1 \, \text{eV} \), \( \lambda_1 = 12.2 \, \text{Å} \); For \( K_2 = 10^4 \, \text{eV} \), \( \lambda_2 = 0.122 \, \text{Å} \); For \( K_3 = 10^5 \, \text{eV} \), \( \lambda_3 = 0.039 \, \text{Å} \).**
