Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the force the Earth exerts on the moon. Hmm, I remember that Newton's law of universal gravitation is involved here. The formula is F = G * (M * m) / r², where G is the gravitational constant, M and m are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between their centers.

Wait, let me think. The Earth's mass is about 5.97 × 10^24 kg, and the moon's mass is roughly 7.35 × 10^22 kg. The average distance between them is around 384,400 km, which is 3.844 × 10^8 meters. Oh, but the answer options are in dynes, so I need to convert units properly.

Newton's gravitational constant G is 6.674 × 10^-11 N·m²/kg². But dynes are in cgs units, right? So 1 N = 10^5 dynes. So after calculating the force in newtons, I'll multiply by 10^5 to get dynes.

Let me plug in the numbers. F = (6.674e-11) * (5.97e24 kg * 7.35e22 kg) / (3.844e8 m)^2.

First, calculate the numerator: 5.97e24 * 7.35e22 = let's see, 5.97 *7.35 is about 43.8, so 43.8e46 kg².

Then the denominator: (3.844e8)^2 = (3.844)^2 is about 14.77, so 14.77e16 m².

So F = 6.674e-11 * (43.8e46) / (14.77e16). Let's compute that step by step.

6.674e-11 *43.8e46 = 6.674 *43.8 = approx 292. Then 292e35 (because 1e-11 *1e46=1e35).

Now divide by 14.77e16: 292e35 /14.77e16 = (292/14.77) * 1e19. 292 divided by 14.77 is roughly 19.77. So 19.77e19 N.

Wait, that seems low. Let me double-check my exponents. Oh, wait, 43.8e46 divided by 14.77e16 is 43.8/14.77 = ~2.967e30? Wait, no, wait: 43.8e46 /14.77e16 = (43.8/14.77) * 1e(46-16) = 2.967 *1e30.

Then multiply by 6.674e-11: 6.674e-11 * 2.967e30 = 6.674 *2.967 = approx 19.82, and 1e( -11 +30 )=1e19. So F ≈19.82e19 N, which is 1.982e20 N.

Wait, but that's in newtons. To convert to dynes, multiply by 1e5, so 1.982e20 *1e5 =1.982e25 dynes. Hmm, looking at the options, option J is 2.8e25, which is higher, but option B is 5e25, which is way higher. Wait, did I make a mistake in calculations?

Wait, maybe I messed up the exponents somewhere. Let me recalculate:

M = 5.97e24 kg, m=7.35e22 kg. So M*m =5.97e24 *7.35e22 =5.97*7.35=43.8, times 1e46, so 4.38e47 kg².

r =3.844e8 m. So r²= (3.844e8)^2=14.77e16 m².

F= G*(M*m)/r² =6.674e-11 *4.38e47 /1.477e17.

Compute numerator:6.674e-11 *4.38e47 =6.674*4.38=29.2, times 1e36 (since -11 +47=36). So 2.92e37.

Divide by 1.477e17: 2.92e37 /1.477e17 ≈1.977e20 N.

Convert to dynes: 1.977e20 N *1e5 dynes/N=1.977e25 dynes. So approximately 2.0e25, which is option D:2.0 ×10^25 dynes.

Wait, but I thought the moon's orbit is due to the gravitational pull, and I remember that the force is about 1e25 or so. So according to this, the answer should be D. But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes people might confuse the force with the tidal force or something else. Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation in exponents.

Wait, another approach: using known values. The average gravitational force between Earth and Moon is about 2.0e25 dynes. I've read that before. So yes, option D.

The force with which the Earth attracts the Moon can be calculated using Newton's law of universal gravitation. By applying the formula \( F = G \times \frac{M \times m}{r^2} \), where \( M \) is the Earth's mass, \( m \) is the Moon's mass, \( r \) is the distance between their centers, and \( G \) is the gravitational constant, the force is determined to be approximately \( 2.0 \times 10^{25} \) dynes. This aligns with known values for the Earth-Moon gravitational force.
