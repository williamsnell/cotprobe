Question:

Aggressive ants live in the swollen thorns of a small tropical tree and feed on oil-rich bodies that the tree produces at the tips of its leaflets. Which of the following experiments best tests the hypothesis that ants defend the plant by either killing or chasing away leaf-feeding insects?

Options:

A: Remove oil-rich bodies and measure subsequent ant density.

C: Add more oil-rich bodies and measure subsequent leaf damage.
D: Remove leaf-feeding insects and measure subsequent leaf damage.
E: Remove ants and measure subsequent thorn growth.
F: Add more leaf-feeding insects and measure subsequent ant density.
G: Remove the thorns and measure subsequent density of ants.
H: Remove the tree and measure subsequent ant density.
I: Remove ants and measure subsequent leaf damage.
J: Add more ants and measure subsequent leaf damage.

Okay, so I've got this biology question here about ants and a tropical tree. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question says that aggressive ants live in the swollen thorns of a small tropical tree. These ants feed on oil-rich bodies produced by the tree at the tips of its leaflets. The hypothesis we're supposed to test is whether these ants defend the plant by either killing or chasing away leaf-feeding insects.

The options are from A to J, each proposing a different experiment. I need to figure out which experiment best tests the hypothesis.

First, I need to understand the hypothesis clearly. The hypothesis suggests that the ants protect the plant by either killing insects that feed on the leaves or by chasing them away. So, if we can show that when ants are present, there are fewer leaf-feeding insects, or that without ants, leaf damage increases, that would support the hypothesis.

Looking at the options, each experiment manipulates a variable and measures something. I should think about what each option does and what it measures.

Option A: Remove oil-rich bodies and measure ant density. Hmm. The oil-rich bodies are the ants' food. If we remove them, maybe the ants would leave, but the question is about defense. This option seems more about the ants' food source affecting their presence, not directly about defending against insects.

Option B: Remove leaf-feeding insects and measure ant density. Wait, if we remove the insects, what's the point? We can't really see how the ants affect the insects if the insects are already gone. This might not test the hypothesis effectively.

Option C: Add more oil-rich bodies and measure leaf damage. Adding more food might attract more ants, but again, the focus is on the ants' effect on leaf damage, not directly on the insects. It's about the food affecting ant behavior, not their defensive role.

Option D: Remove leaf-feeding insects and measure leaf damage. If we remove the insects, then we can't measure the effect of the ants on them. It's like taking away the thing you're supposed to measure the effect on. So this doesn't seem right either.

Option E: Remove thorns and measure ant density. Thorns are where the ants live. If we remove them, maybe the ants leave, but again, this is about habitat and ant presence, not about their defensive behavior against insects.

Option F: Add more leaf-feeding insects and measure ant density. So adding more insects and seeing if ant density changes. But wait, if the ants are there defending, then adding more insects might cause the ants to come out more, but this is about ant density, not about whether the insects are being killed or chased away. So it's a bit indirect.

Option G: Remove thorns and measure ant density. Similar to E. Removing the thorns would likely reduce ant density because they lose their home. But this again doesn't directly test defense against insects.

Option H: Remove the tree and measure ant density. That's drastic. Removing the tree would probably mean the ants have to leave, but it doesn't test anything about their defensive behavior.

Option I: Remove ants and measure leaf damage. Oh, this sounds promising. If we remove the ants, and then see if leaf damage increases, that would suggest that the ants were indeed protecting the leaves. Like, if without ants, more insects come in and damage the leaves, that supports the hypothesis.

Option J: Add more ants and measure leaf damage. If adding more ants reduces leaf damage, that would support the hypothesis. But the hypothesis is about the ants defending by killing or chasing away insects. So this is a possible approach, but I think it's more about the effect of ant numbers rather than directly testing their defensive behavior.

So, the hypothesis is about whether the ants defend the plant, so the experiment should test what happens when the ants are removed. If removing ants leads to more leaf damage (because insects aren't being chased away or killed), that would support the hypothesis. So option I seems to fit.

Wait, but let me think again. The hypothesis is about the ants defending by either killing or chasing away the insects. So another approach could be to see if the presence of ants reduces the number of insects or the damage. Alternatively, removing the insects and seeing if the ants compensate, but I don't think that's the case here.

Option I is about removing the ants and measuring leaf damage. If leaf damage increases, that suggests that the ants were preventing it. That makes sense because if the ants are gone, the insects can feed more without being disturbed.

Option F is adding more insects and seeing if ant density changes. But that might not directly show that the ants are defending against them. It could show that more insects attract more ants, but not necessarily that the ants are actively defending.

Option D is removing insects and measuring leaf damage. But if you remove the insects, you can't measure damage because there's nothing to damage the leaves. So that doesn't test anything.

So the best experiment is I: Remove ants and measure leaf damage. If leaf damage increases, it supports the hypothesis that ants defend the plant.
</think>

To test the hypothesis that ants defend the plant by killing or chasing away leaf-feeding insects, the experiment should directly assess the relationship between the presence of ants and the level of leaf damage. Among the options, removing the ants (Option I) and measuring subsequent leaf damage is the most effective approach. If leaf damage increases without the ants, it supports the idea that the ants were actively defending the plant by preventing insect feeding. Other options either manipulate unrelated variables or fail to directly test the defensive role of the ants.
