Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about photoelectrons and kinetic energy. Hmm, let me think. I remember from my classes that this has to do with the photoelectric effect. Right, the basic idea is that when light hits a metal surface, electrons are ejected, and their kinetic energy depends on the frequency of the light and the metal's work function.

The question says the metal is magnesium with a work function φ of 3.7 eV. The light used is ultraviolet with a frequency of 1.5 × 10^15 Hz. I need to find the maximum kinetic energy of the ejected photoelectrons.

I think the formula I need is the one from Einstein's photoelectric equation: KE_max = hν - φ. Where h is Planck's constant, ν is the frequency of the incident light, and φ is the work function.

Wait, right, Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 × 10^-34 J·s. But since the frequency is given in Hz (which is 1/s), multiplying them will give me energy in joules. I need to convert that to electron volts because the work function is in eV.

Oh, right, 1 eV is equal to 1.602 × 10^-19 joules. So I can calculate hν in eV by using the conversion factor.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, calculate the energy of the photon, hν:
hν = h * ν
h = 6.626e-34 J·s
ν = 1.5e15 Hz

So hν = 6.626e-34 * 1.5e15 = let's calculate that. 6.626 * 1.5 is about 9.939, so 9.939e-19 J. 

Now convert that to eV. Since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, I divide 9.939e-19 J by 1.602e-19 J/eV.

So 9.939e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.204 eV. Let me double-check that division. 9.939 divided by 1.602 is approximately 6.204, yes.

Now, the maximum kinetic energy KE_max is this photon energy minus the work function φ.

φ is 3.7 eV, so KE_max = 6.204 eV - 3.7 eV = 2.504 eV.

Looking at the options, option J is 2.5 eV, which is close. But wait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, 6.626e-34 * 1.5e15 = 6.626 * 1.5 = 9.939, so yes, 9.939e-19 J. Divided by 1.602e-19 gives about 6.204 eV. Subtract 3.7 eV, that's 2.504 eV. So J is 2.5 eV, which is the closest option.

But wait, none of the options say 2.5 eV except J. So the correct answer should be J. Wait, let me check the options again. Yes, option J is 2.5 eV. So that's the maximum kinetic energy.

The maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons is calculated using the photoelectric equation:  

\[
KE_{\text{max}} = h\nu - \varphi
\]  

Given:  
- Work function of magnesium, \(\varphi = 3.7 \, \text{eV}\)  
- Frequency of ultraviolet light, \(\nu = 1.5 \times 10^{15} \, \text{Hz}\)  
- Planck's constant, \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\)  
- Conversion factor: \(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)  

First, calculate the energy of the photon:  
\[
h\nu = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \times (1.5 \times 10^{15}) = 9.939 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
\]  

Convert this energy to electron volts:  
\[
h\nu = \frac{9.939 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.204 \, \text{eV}
\]  

Subtract the work function to find the maximum kinetic energy:  
\[
KE_{\text{max}} = 6.204 \, \text{eV} - 3.7 \, \text{eV} = 2.504 \, \text{eV}
\]  

The closest option is **2.5 eV**, which corresponds to **J**.
