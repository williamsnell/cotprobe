Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about finding the atomic weight of natural chlorine. Hmm, I remember from class that atomic weight is like the average of all the isotopes, weighted by their abundance. Chlorine has two main isotopes, Cl-35 and Cl-37, right?

The problem says that 75.53% is Cl-35 with a mass of 34.968, and 24.47% is Cl-37 with a mass of 36.956. Wait, but percentages might not always add up to 100% exactly because of rounding, but here they do. So I think I can just use these percentages as the weights.

So the formula for calculating the atomic weight (or average atomic mass) is the sum of each isotope's mass multiplied by its fractional abundance. That makes sense because each isotope contributes to the overall average based on how much of it there is.

Let me write that down. The formula is:

Atomic Weight = (Abundance of Cl-35 × Mass of Cl-35) + (Abundance of Cl-37 × Mass of Cl-37)

Wait, but the abundances are given in percentages. I should convert them to decimals first. So 75.53% becomes 0.7553 and 24.47% becomes 0.2447.

Now plugging in the numbers:

Cl-35 part: 0.7553 × 34.968
Cl-37 part: 0.2447 × 36.956

Let me calculate each part step by step.

First, 0.7553 multiplied by 34.968. Let me do that. Hmm, 0.7553 * 34.968. Let me approximate. 0.7 * 35 is about 24.5, but I need to be exact. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it more accurately.

Wait, maybe I should use a calculator, but since I don't have one, I'll try to compute it roughly. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute each multiplication.

Wait, perhaps I can compute each term.

Cl-35 contribution: 0.7553 * 34.968. Let me approximate 0.7553 as 0.755 for easier calculation. 34.968 is approximately 35. So 0.755 *35 = 26.425. But wait, 34.968 is a bit less than 35, so the actual value would be a bit less than 26.425. Let me see, 34.968 -35 = -0.032. So 0.7553 * -0.032 is a small negative number. Let me compute 0.7553 *34.968 = 0.7553*(35 - 0.032) = 0.7553*35 - 0.7553*0.032

0.7553 *35 = 26.4355, and 0.7553 *0.032 is approximately 0.02417. So subtracting, 26.4355 - 0.02417 ≈ 26.4113.

So Cl-35 contributes approximately 26.4113.

Now Cl-37: 0.2447 *36.956. Let me approximate that. 0.2447 is about 0.245, and 36.956 is close to 37.

0.245 *37 is 9.065. But let me check more accurately. 0.2447 *36.956.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it as (0.2 *36.956) + (0.0447 *36.956). 

0.2 *36.956 =7.3912. 

0.0447 *36.956 ≈ let's compute 0.04 *36.956 = 1.47824, and 0.0047*36.956≈ 0.173. So adding together, 1.47824 + 0.173 ≈1.65124.

Adding to 7.3912 gives 7.3912 +1.65124 ≈9.04244.

So the Cl-37 contribution is approximately 9.04244.

Now adding both contributions: 26.4113 +9.04244 ≈35.4537.

Looking at the options, H is 35.45. So that's probably the answer. Let me just double-check my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made an approximation error. Let me recalculate the Cl-35 contribution more accurately.

34.968 * 0.7553.

Let me compute 34.968 *0.7553 step by step.

First, 34.968 * 0.7 = 24.4776

34.968 *0.05 =1.7484

34.968 *0.005= 0.17484

34.968 *0.0003=0.0104904

Adding all together: 24.4776 +1.7484 =26.226; 26.226 +0.17484=26.40084; 26.40084 +0.0104904≈26.41133.

So that matches the earlier calculation.

Cl-37: 36.956 *0.2447.

Let me compute 36.956 ×0.2447.

Another approach: 36.956 ×0.2 =7.3912

36.956 ×0.04=1.47824

36.956 ×0.004=0.147824

36.956 ×0.0007=0.0258692

Wait, but 0.2447 is 0.2 +0.04 +0.004 +0.0007? Wait, 0.2+0.04 is 0.24, plus 0.004 is 0.244, plus 0.0007 is 0.2447. So yes.

So adding:

7.3912 (from 0.2) 

+1.47824 (0.04) =8.86944

+0.147824 (0.004) =9.017264

+0.0258692 (0.0007) =9.0431332.

So Cl-37 contributes approximately 9.043133.

Adding both: 26.41133 (Cl-35) +9.043133 (Cl-37) =35.45446.

Hmm, so the atomic weight is approximately 35.4545. Looking at the options, H is 35.45, which matches closely. So the answer should be H.

To determine the atomic weight of natural chlorine, we use the formula for average atomic mass, which is the sum of each isotope's mass multiplied by its fractional abundance. The given abundances are 75.53% for chlorine-35 (Cl-35) and 24.47% for chlorine-37 (Cl-37). Converting these percentages to decimals gives 0.7553 and 0.2447, respectively.

1. **Calculate the contribution of Cl-35:**
   \[
   0.7553 \times 34.968 = 26.4113
   \]

2. **Calculate the contribution of Cl-37:**
   \[
   0.2447 \times 36.956 = 9.0431
   \]

3. **Sum the contributions:**
   \[
   26.4113 + 9.0431 = 35.4544
   \]

The calculated atomic weight is approximately 35.45, which corresponds to option **H**.

Answer: H
