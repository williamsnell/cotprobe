Question:

A farmer was the fee-simple owner of a tract of land inthe country. The farmer moved to the city in 1986. Aman took possession of the land in 1987 as an adversepossessor and remained on the land from 1987 to 1997;he then left the property to care for his sick mother forone year, returning the following year, 1999. Assume that the statutory period for adverse possession in this state is 20 years. In 2010, the farmer wanted to move back to the tract because he desired to return to the country. Finding the man in possession, the farmer initiated a suit in ejectment against the man. The most probable judicial determination would be

Options:

A: the farmer would lose, because he had abandoned the property for over 20 years.
B: the farmer would win, because the man had not paid property taxes during his occupancy.
C: the farmer would lose, because the man's possession was open, hostile, and continuous.
D: the farmer would lose, because the man had fulfilled the required statutory period to become an adverse possessor.
E: the farmer would win, because the man did not have legal documentation of ownership.
F: the farmer would win, because the man had left the property for a year.
G: the farmer would win, because the man's possession was not continuous.
H: the farmer would lose, because the man was the current resident of the property.
I: the farmer would win, because he is the titleholder of record.
J: the farmer would lose, because the man had made improvements on the land.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about adverse possession. Let me read through the problem again carefully.

So, there's a farmer who was the fee-simple owner of a tract of land. Fee-simple means he owned it outright, right? In 1986, he moved to the city. Then, in 1987, a man took possession of the land as an adverse possessor. He stayed from 1987 to 1997, which is 10 years. Then he left for a year to care for his sick mother, came back in 1999. So, from 1987 to 1997: 10 years, then a year off, then from 1999 onwards, I guess he came back and stayed? The farmer is suing in 2010 to get the man evicted.

The statutory period for adverse possession here is 20 years. So, the key is whether the man has met the statutory period to gain ownership through adverse possession.

First, I remember that adverse possession requires continuous, open, and hostile possession for the statutory period. The elements are: (1) actual possession, (2) adversity (hostile), (3) without the owner's permission, (4) continuous for the statutory period, and (5) payment of taxes (sometimes, depending on the state).

In this case, the man took possession in 1987, stayed until 1997 (10 years), then left for a year, then came back in 1999. So, from 1987 to 1997 is 10 years, then from 1999 to 2010 is another 11 years. Wait, let me count that: 1999 to 2010 is 11 years, but he was away for a year in 1998. So, does the time count as continuous? Because he left for a year, was that a break in possession?

I think the statutory period requires continuous possession without interruption. If he left for a year, that might break the continuity. So from 1987 to 1997 is 10 years, then he stops for a year, then starts again in 1999. So, from 1999 to 2010 is 11 years, but the total time since 1987 would be 23 years, but with a break in between. Wait, no, because the break was in the middle. So does that reset the clock, or does the period have to be unbroken?

I think in some jurisdictions, a temporary absence might not break the continuity if it's not too long. But in others, any absence could interrupt the continuity. So, if the statutory period is 20 years, and the man's possession was from 1987 to 1997 (10 years), then he left for a year, then came back in 1999. So, from 1999 to 2010 is 11 years. But 10 + 11 is 21 years, but with a break in the middle. But since the break was a year, maybe the continuity is broken, so the 11 years after 1999 don't count towards the 20-year period because the prior 10 years were interrupted.

Alternatively, maybe the time after the break is considered separately. So, from 1999 to 2010 is 11 years, which is less than 20, so he hasn't met the period yet.

Wait, but the farmer moved to the city in 1986, so the man started in 1987. So, the farmer didn't take any action until 2010, which is 24 years later. The man's possession was from 1987 to 1997 (10 years), then a year off, then from 1999 to 2010 (11 years). So total time from 1987 to 2010 is 23 years, but with a break in 1998. So, does the break matter?

If the break is considered a discontinuance, then the prior 10 years and the later 11 years don't add up to the 20 years needed. Alternatively, if the break is too long, the continuity is broken, so the time before and after don't count together. So, the man only had 10 years before the break and 11 after, but each period was less than 20 years. So, he hasn't met the 20-year requirement.

Wait, but the statutory period is 20 years. So, if he had 10 years, then a break, then another 11 years, the total is 21 years, but with a break. Does the break reset the clock, meaning he would need to start counting from 1999? So, from 1999 to 2010 is 11 years, which is still less than 20. Therefore, he hasn't met the period yet.

But wait, in some states, a temporary absence doesn't break the continuity. For example, if someone is away for a few months, it's still considered continuous. But a year might be too long. So, the question is whether the one-year absence breaks the continuity. If it does, then the man hasn't met the 20-year period because from 1999 to 2010 is only 11 years, which is less than 20.

Alternatively, maybe the time before the break counts, and after the break continues. So, 10 years before the break, and then 11 years after, totaling 21 years. But the break might have interrupted, so the 21 years don't count as a single continuous period. Therefore, he hasn't met the 20-year requirement.

So, if the man hasn't met the 20-year period, then he can't claim adverse possession, and the farmer would win.

Looking at the options:

Option D says the farmer would lose because the man fulfilled the statutory period. But if the man's possession was not continuous due to the one-year absence, then D is incorrect.

Option G says the farmer would win because the man's possession was not continuous. That seems correct if the break in 1998中断中断了连续占有。

Option C says the farmer would lose because the man's possession was open, hostile, and continuous. But if it's not continuous due to the break, then C is incorrect.

So, the key is whether the one-year absence breaks the continuity. If it does, the man hasn't met the 20-year period, so the farmer wins, because the man hasn't adverse-possessed the land for the full period.

Therefore, the correct answer would be G: the farmer would win because the man's possession was not continuous.

The farmer would win because the man's possession was not continuous due to the one-year absence in 1998, which interrupted the required statutory period of 20 years for adverse possession.
