Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a swimmer diving into deeper water and the intensity of light decreasing. The question is asking me to calculate the depth at which the diver experiences half the surface intensity of light. Hmm, I need to figure this out.

Alright, let's start by recalling what I know about light absorption in water. I remember something about the Beer-Lambert Law, which describes how the intensity of light decreases exponentially as it passes through a medium. The formula is I = I0 * e^(-μl), where I is the intensity after passing through a length l, I0 is the initial intensity, and μ is the absorption coefficient.

Wait, the problem gives me the mean molar absorption coefficient, which is 6.2e-3 dm³ mol⁻¹ cm⁻¹. Oh right, that's the μ value. But wait, the units are a bit confusing. Let me make sure I understand them correctly.

So, μ is given in dm³ per mol per cm. I think that's the same as cm² per mol, because 1 dm³ is 1000 cm³, so maybe I need to convert units. Let's see, 1 dm³ is 1 liter, which is 1000 cm³. So, 6.2e-3 dm³/mol/cm is equal to 6.2e-3 * 1000 cm³/mol/cm. That would be 6.2 cm²/mol. Because cm³/cm is cm². So, μ is 6.2 cm²/mol.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit rusty on the exact units. Another approach: the molar absorption coefficient (often denoted as ε) usually has units of cm⁻¹ M⁻¹, where M is molarity (mol/L). But here, the given unit is dm³ mol⁻¹ cm⁻¹, which is the same as (1/dm³·mol·cm). Wait, that's the same as 1/(L·mol·cm). Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the absorption coefficient μ is in terms of molar extinction coefficient times concentration. But no, the problem states it's the mean molar absorption coefficient, so perhaps it's ε in units of cm⁻¹·mol⁻¹·dm³. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's just take the given value as 6.2e-3 dm³/(mol·cm). 

Wait, perhaps I should convert the units to something more manageable. Since 1 dm³ is 1 liter, which is 0.001 m³. But maybe it's better to convert everything into meters and centimeters. Let me think about the Beer-Lambert Law again.

The Beer-Lambert Law is I = I0 * e^(-μc l), where c is the concentration in mol/dm³, and l is the path length in cm. Wait, but in this problem, I think μ is given per mol, so perhaps the equation simplifies because the concentration of seawater is considered here, but perhaps the problem assumes that the concentration is 1 mol/dm³? Or maybe not. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the problem says "mean molar absorption coefficient." So the absorption coefficient μ is 6.2e-3 dm³/(mol·cm). So the units are dm³ per (mol·cm). So, if I have a solution where the concentration is c (mol/dm³), then the actual absorption coefficient would be μ_total = μ * c. So, the Beer-Lambert Law becomes I = I0 * e^(-μ * c * l), where l is the path length in cm.

But wait, the problem doesn't give me the concentration. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the concentration is 1 mol/dm³, making μ_total = 6.2e-3 dm³/(mol·cm) * 1 mol/dm³ = 6.2e-3 cm⁻¹.

Wait, that makes sense. Because 1/(dm³) is 1/L, and 1 dm³ is 1000 cm³, so 1 dm³ = 1000 cm³. So, 6.2e-3 dm³/(mol·cm) * 1 mol/dm³ equals 6.2e-3 / (cm) * (dm³/dm³) )= 6.2e-3 cm⁻¹.

Wait, no—let me think again. Let's compute the units carefully. μ is given as 6.2e-3 dm³/(mol·cm). If I multiply this by the concentration c in mol/dm³, the units would be (dm³/(mol·cm)) * (mol/dm³) )= 1/cm. So μ_total has units of 1/cm, which is correct for the absorption coefficient in the Beer-Lambert equation.

So, if we have a concentration c = 1 mol/dm³, then μ_total = 6.2e-3 cm⁻¹.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. The molar absorption coefficient (epsilon) is typically in cm⁻¹ M⁻¹, where M is mol/L. So 1 M is 1 mol/dm³. Therefore, 6.2e-3 dm³/(mol·cm) is the same as 6.2e-3 cm⁻¹·(1/M), because 1/(mol/dm³) is dm³/mol, and 1/dm³ is 1/L, which is 1 M⁻¹. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused, but maybe it's better to proceed with the calculation.

The problem asks for the depth where the intensity is half of the surface intensity. So, I = I0/2. Plugging into Beer-Lambert:

I0/2 = I0 * e^(-μ_total * l)

Divide both sides by I0: 1/2 = e^(-μ_total * l)

Take natural log: ln(1/2) = -μ_total * l

So, ln(1/2) is -ln(2) ≈ -0.6931.

Thus, -0.6931 = -μ_total * l → μ_total * l = 0.6931 → l = 0.6931 / μ_total.

But wait, I need to make sure about the units. Let me get back.

Earlier, I thought μ_total is 6.2e-3 cm⁻¹. So, l = 0.6931 / (6.2e-3 cm⁻¹ )

Compute that: 0.6931 / 0.0062 = approximately 111.79 cm. Because 0.0062 * 111.79 ≈ 0.693.

Wait, 0.0062 times 111 is 0.6882, which is close to 0.693. So, 111.79 cm is about 1.1179 meters. Wait, so that's approximately 1.12 meters. Looking at the options, option D is 1.2 m, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I did a miscalculation in the conversion of units earlier. Let me check again.

Given μ is 6.2e-3 dm³/(mol·cm). If the concentration is c mol/dm³, then μ_total = μ * c = (6.2e-3 dm³/(mol·cm)) * c (mol/dm³) ) = (6.2e-3 / cm) * (dm³ * mol) / (mol * dm³) ) → units are 1/cm. So, μ_total is 6.2e-3 * c cm⁻¹.

But wait, if the problem doesn't specify the concentration, perhaps the question is considering that the absorption coefficient is already per unit length, so maybe I should take c as 1, or perhaps the units were already handled.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently.

In the Beer-Lambert Law, the absorption coefficient (μ) is in cm⁻¹ when the concentration is in mol/L (M). So, if the given μ is 6.2e-3 dm³/(mol·cm), that's equivalent to 6.2e-3 * 1000 cm³/(mol·cm) because 1 dm³ is 1000 cm³. So, 6.2e-3 * 1000 = 6.2 cm²/(mol·cm) → 6.2 cm/(mol). Wait, no: 6.2e-3 dm³/(mol·cm) is 6.2e-3 * 1000 cm³/(mol·cm) = 6.2 cm²/(mol).

Wait, no, 1 dm³ = 1000 cm³, so 6.2e-3 dm³/(mol·cm) = 6.2e-3 * 1000 cm³/(mol·cm) = 6.2 cm²/(mol). That's because cm³/cm is cm².

So, the molar absorption coefficient is 6.2 cm²/mol. Then, the absorption coefficient μ (in cm⁻¹) is given by μ = ε * c, where ε is the molar absorption coefficient (cm²/mol), and c is the concentration in mol/cm³ (since 1 M = 1 mol/dm³ = 1 mol/L = 0.001 mol/cm³).

Wait, wait, because 1 dm³ is 1000 cm³, so 1 mol/dm³ is 1 mol/1000 cm³ = 0.001 mol/cm³. So, if the concentration c is 1 mol/dm³, then c = 0.001 mol/cm³.

So, μ = ε * c = (6.2 cm²/mol) * (0.001 mol/cm³) ) = 0.0062 cm⁻¹.

Ah, that makes sense. So, μ is 0.0062 cm⁻¹.

Now, going back to the equation: l = ln(2) / μ.

ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So, l = 0.6931 / 0.0062 cm⁻¹.

Let me compute that: 0.6931 divided by 0.0062.

0.0062 goes into 0.6931 how many times?

Let me compute 0.6931 / 0.0062.

I can write this as 693.1 / 6.2.

Because 0.6931 is 693.1e-3, and 0.0062 is 6.2e-3.

So, 693.1 / 6.2 = ?

Well, 6.2 times 111 is 688.2. Because 6*111=666, 0.2*111=22.2, total 688.2.

So, 6.2 * 111 = 688.2, which is less than 693.1.

The difference is 693.1 - 688.2 = 4.9.

So, 4.9 / 6.2 ≈ 0.79.

So, 111.79.

So, 693.1 /6.2 ≈ 111.79 cm.

Which is 1.1179 meters. Approximately 1.12 meters.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.2 m, which is the closest. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should do it more accurately.

Compute 0.6931 / 0.0062:

Let me compute 0.6931 ÷ 0.0062.

0.0062 × 111 = 0.6882

0.6931 - 0.6882 = 0.0049

Now, 0.0049 ÷ 0.0062 ≈ 0.79.

So, total is 111.79 cm, which is 1.1179 m, about 1.12 m.

The options are A:1.8m, B:1.5m, C:2.0m, D:1.2m, etc.

So, 1.12 m is closest to option D:1.2 m.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I get the units right? Because the absorption coefficient is per cm, and the depth is in meters. So, 111.79 cm is 1.1179 meters, which is approximately 1.12 meters.

So, the correct answer should be approximately 1.12 meters, which is option D:1.2 m.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the absorption coefficient.

Wait, another way to approach this: since the absorption coefficient is 6.2e-3 dm³/(mol·cm), perhaps I should consider the concentration of seawater. Do I know the typical concentration of seawater? I think seawater has an average salinity of about 3.5% salt, which is about 35 g/L. The molar mass of seawater is roughly similar to that of pure water, about 18 g/mol, but with dissolved salts. Wait, but perhaps for this problem, the concentration is taken as 1 mol/dm³, which is 1 M.

Wait, but maybe I should check if the concentration affects the result.

If the concentration c is 1 mol/dm³, then μ_total is 6.2e-3 cm⁻¹, as I calculated. So, with μ=0.0062 cm⁻¹, l=0.6931/0.0062 ≈111.79 cm=1.1179 m.

So, the answer would be approximately 1.12 m, which is option D:1.2 m.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the molar absorption coefficient is given as 6.2e-3 dm³ per mol per cm, which is 6.2e-3 dm³/(mol·cm). So, let's consider the units again.

Wait, 1 dm³ is 1000 cm³, so 6.2e-3 dm³/(mol·cm) is 6.2e-3 * 1000 cm³/(mol·cm) = 6.2 cm²/(mol). So, the molar absorption coefficient is 6.2 cm²/mol.

Then, the absorption coefficient μ is μ= ε * c, where ε is in cm²/mol, and c is in mol/cm³. So, if the concentration c is 1 mol/dm³, which is 0.001 mol/cm³, then μ=6.2 cm²/mol * 0.001 mol/cm³ = 0.0062 cm⁻¹.

So, same as before. So, l=0.6931 /0.0062 cm⁻¹=111.79 cm=1.1179 m≈1.12 m.

So, the closest option is D:1.2 m.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the absorption coefficient is already 6.2e-3 cm⁻¹, but that doesn't make sense because the given units don't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the unit conversion. Let's double-check.

The given μ:6.2e-3 dm³/(mol·cm).

1 dm³=1000 cm³.

So, 6.2e-3 dm³/(mol·cm)=6.2e-3 * 1000 cm³/(mol·cm) =6.2 cm²/(mol).

So, ε=6.2 cm²/mol.

Then, concentration c is in mol/dm³. Let's say c=1 mol/dm³=0.001 mol/cm³.

Thus, μ= ε * c =6.2 cm²/mol * 0.001 mol/cm³=0.0062 cm⁻¹.

So, same as before.

Thus, l=0.6931 /0.0062 = 111.79 cm=1.1179 m.

So, the answer is approximately 1.12 meters, which is option D:1.2 m.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 0.77 m, which is about half of that. Did I miss a unit conversion?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Beer-Lambert Law. Let me check that formula again.

The correct formula is I = I0 * e^(-μ l), where l is the path length in cm, and μ is in cm⁻¹.

So, the calculation seems correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the absorption coefficient is given per meter instead of per cm. Let me check the units again.

No, the given μ is in dm³/(mol·cm), which converted to cm²/(mol). So, I think the calculation is correct.

So, I think the correct answer is approximately 1.12 m, which is closest to option D:1.2 m.

To determine the depth at which a diver experiences half the surface intensity of light, we use the Beer-Lambert Law:

\[
I = I_0 \cdot e^{-\mu l}
\]

Here, \(I_0\) is the initial intensity, \(I\) is the intensity at depth \(l\), and \(\mu\) is the absorption coefficient.

### Step 1: Understanding the given data
- The mean molar absorption coefficient is \(\mu = 6.2 \times 10^{-3} \, \mathrm{dm}^3 \, \mathrm{mol}^{-1} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-1}\).
- We need to find the depth \(l\) where \(I = \frac{I_0}{2}\).

### Step 2: Rearranging the Beer-Lambert Law
Since \(I = \frac{I_0}{2}\), we have:

\[
\frac{I_0}{2} = I_0 \cdot e^{-\mu l}
\]

Dividing both sides by \(I_0\):

\[
\frac{1}{2} = e^{-\mu l}
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\mu l
\]

\[
-\ln(2) = -\mu l
\]

\[
\mu l = \ln(2)
\]

\[
l = \frac{\ln(2)}{\mu}
\]

### Step 3: Converting units
The given \(\mu = 6.2 \times 10^{-3} \, \mathrm{dm}^3 \, \mathrm{mol}^{-1} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-1}\). Converting \(\mathrm{dm}^3\) to \(\mathrm{cm}^3\) (\(1 \, \mathrm{dm}^3 = 1000 \, \mathrm{cm}^3\)):

\[
\mu = 6.2 \times 10^{-3} \, \mathrm{dm}^3 \, \mathrm{mol}^{-1} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-1} = 6.2 \, \mathrm{cm}^2 \, \mathrm{mol}^{-1}
\]

Assuming a seawater concentration of \(c = 1 \, \mathrm{mol} \, \mathrm{dm}^{-3} = 0.001 \, \mathrm{mol} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-3}\), the absorption coefficient becomes:

\[
\mu_{\text{total}} = \mu \cdot c = 6.2 \, \mathrm{cm}^2 \, \mathrm{mol}^{-1} \cdot 0.001 \, \mathrm{mol} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-3} = 0.0062 \, \mathrm{cm}^{-1}
\]

### Step 4: Calculating the depth
Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
l = \frac{0.6931}{0.0062} \approx 111.79 \, \mathrm{cm} = 1.1179 \, \mathrm{m}
\]

### Step 5: Selecting the closest option
The calculated depth is approximately \(1.12 \, \mathrm{m}\), which is closest to option **D: 1.2 m**.
