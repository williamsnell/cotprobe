Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about adding two numbers, 109 and -42, using different 8-bit representations. The question is asking which of the representations (One's complement, Two's complement, Sign and magnitude) can correctly add these numbers without going out of range. The options are I, II, and III, and I have to choose from A to J.

First, I need to understand what each representation means and how addition works in each. Let me break it down step by step.

So, 8-bit numbers can represent values from -128 to 127 in two's complement, but I'm not sure about the others. Let me think about each representation.

Starting with Two's Complement (Option II). I know that two's complement is the most common way to represent signed integers in computers. For 8 bits, the range is -128 to 127. Let's check if 109 and -42 fall within this range. 109 is less than 127, so yes. -42 is greater than -128, so yes. So both numbers are within the range. Now, adding them: 109 + (-42) = 67. That's definitely within the range, so in two's complement, the addition is possible without overflow.

Next, One's Complement (Option I). One's complement uses the same bit pattern but the range is a bit different. For 8 bits, the range is from -127 to 127. Wait, because in one's complement, the positive numbers go from 0 to 127, and negative from -127 to -1. So 109 is within 0-127, so that's fine. -42 is within -127 to -1, so that's okay too. Now, adding 109 and -42 gives 67. But wait, in one's complement, adding can sometimes lead to end-around carry issues. But the question is whether the addition is within range, not whether the result is correct. Since 67 is within 0-127, I think the addition is possible without overflow. So one's complement should be okay.

Now, Sign and Magnitude (Option III). Sign and magnitude uses the first bit as the sign (0 for positive, 1 for negative) and the remaining 7 bits for the magnitude. So the range is from -127 to 127, same as one's complement because the magnitude can't exceed 7 bits (127 is 0b1111111). So 109 and -42 are both within this range. Adding them gives 67, which is also within the range. So sign and magnitude should be okay as well.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. When adding in sign and magnitude, do we have to consider any carry-over beyond the 8 bits? Let me think. In sign and magnitude, each number is treated separately. So when adding, if the sum exceeds the maximum positive or goes below the minimum negative, it's an overflow. But in this case, 109 and -42 add up to 67, which is within 0-127, so no overflow. So the addition is possible.

Wait, but I'm not sure if all three representations can handle this addition. Let me double-check each.

In two's complement, the maximum is 127, so 109 is fine. The minimum is -128, and -42 is within that. Sum is 67, which is within range. So II is correct.

In one's complement, the max is 127, so 109 is okay. Min is -127, so -42 is okay. Sum is 67, which is within 0-127. So I is correct.

In sign and magnitude, same as one's complement, I think. So III is correct too. So all three should be correct. But wait, the options don't have an option where all three are correct. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: I and II only

B: I, II, and III

C: III only

D: II and III only

E: I and III only

F: I only

G: II only

H: All are out of range

I: None of the above

J: Only in signed magnitude and one's complement

Wait, but in the initial analysis, I thought all three can represent the numbers, but I'm recalling that in sign and magnitude, the maximum positive is 127, and the minimum is -127. So 109 is fine, -42 is fine. The sum is 67, which is within the range. So III should be correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I've heard that sign and magnitude can sometimes have issues with addition, but the question is only about whether the addition is within range, not whether the method correctly computes the sum.

So all three representations can represent both numbers and the sum is within their respective ranges. So the correct answer would be that all three are correct, which is option B.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. Wait, when using sign and magnitude, adding could result in a carry that affects the sign bit. For example, adding the maximum positive and maximum negative might cause an issue. But in this case, adding 109 and -42, the sum is 67, which is positive. Let me see if the 8 bits can hold this.

In sign and magnitude, 67 is represented as 0 followed by 67 in 7 bits. 67 in binary is 1000011, which is 7 bits, so with the sign bit it's 8 bits: 0 1000011. That's fine, no overflow.

Wait, but in two's complement, 8 bits can hold up to 127, so 67 is fine. In one's complement, same, 67 is within 0-127.

So all three representations can represent the sum. So the answer should be B: I, II, and III.

But wait, looking back at the options, option B is I, II, and III. So the correct answer should be B.

The addition of 109 and -42 results in 67, which is within the range for all three representations. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: B
