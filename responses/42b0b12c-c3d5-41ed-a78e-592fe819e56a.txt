Alright, so I've got this question here: Which of these evangelists is a cousin of rocker Jerry Lee Lewis? The options are A through J, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I know that Jerry Lee Lewis is a well-known rockabilly musician, famous for songs like "Great Balls of Fire." But he's also from a religious background, and I remember hearing that some of his family members were in the ministry. So the question is linking him to one of the listed evangelists through a family connection, specifically a cousin.

Let's go through the options one by one.

Option A: Jimmy Swaggart. I know Jimmy Swaggart is a prominent televangelist and a former pastor. He's had some controversies in the past, but I don't recall any direct family connection to Jerry Lee Lewis. Not sure about this one.

Option B: Pat Robertson. He's a major figure in the Christian Broadcasting Network and a well-known conservative figure. I don't think he's related to Jerry Lee Lewis, but I'm not certain. Maybe I should think deeper.

Option C: Kenneth Copeland. He's a prosperity gospel preacher and another big name in televangelism. I don't remember any connection here either.

Option D: Oral Roberts. He's a well-known faith healer and evangelist. I think he's from a musical family, but I don't recall a direct link to Jerry Lee Lewis.

Option E: Billy Graham. He's one of the most famous evangelists of the 20th century. I don't think he's related to Jerry Lee Lewis, but again, not entirely sure.

Option F: Joel Osteen. He's a contemporary Christian author and preacher, known for his positive messaging. Doesn't ring a bell in terms of a family connection.

Option G: Benny Hinn. Another big name in televangelism, known for his healing ministry. I don't think he's a cousin of Jerry Lee Lewis.

Option H: Jerry Falwell. He was a prominent evangelical leader and founder of the Moral Majority. I don't recall any family ties here.

Option I: Joyce Meyer. She's a prosperity gospel teacher and author. I don't think she's related to Jerry Lee Lewis.

Option J: Franklin Graham. He's the son of Billy Graham and a well-known evangelist in his own right. Now, considering that, I think there might be a connection here. I remember hearing that Jerry Lee Lewis and Franklin Graham are cousins. Both are from the same area, maybe even the same state, which is North Carolina. That makes sense because Billy Graham is from there, and so are some of his family members. So, if Franklin is his son, and they're from the same area, it's possible they share a cousin relationship.

Wait, let me think again. Jerry Lee Lewis was actually born in the Mississippi Delta, but his family might have roots in Arkansas. However, Billy Graham was from North Carolina. But I think I've heard somewhere that Jerry Lee Lewis and Franklin Graham are related through their mothers' sides. Maybe their mothers are cousins or something like that, making them cousins. That would make Franklin Graham the cousin of Jerry Lee Lewis. So, that would make option J correct.
