Okay, so I need to answer this multiple-choice question about Keynesian theory. Let me think through it step by step. 

The question is: According to Keynesian theory, which of the following is correct? The options are A to J.

First, I remember that Keynesian economics emphasizes the role of aggregate demand in driving economic growth and fluctuations. Keynes believed that the economy could be in a state of underemployment equilibrium, meaning that the economy might not self-correct without intervention. So, he advocated for government action to manage the economy, especially during recessions.

Keynesian theory suggests that fiscal policy—government spending and taxation—can be a powerful tool to influence economic activity. In contrast, some theories might focus more on monetary policy, but Keynesians argue that fiscal policy is more effective in certain situations, especially when the economy is struggling with high unemployment.

Looking at the options:

A: Changes in the money supply have significant effects. Hmm, I'm not sure. I think Keynesians are more focused on fiscal policy, but they might not deny the effect of money supply. But I'm not certain if this is the right choice.

B: Fiscal policy should not be used to manage the economy. No, that's the opposite of Keynesian theory. Keynesians support using fiscal policy to manage the economy.

C: The FED should allow the money supply to grow at a constant rate. The FED is the central bank, so this sounds more like a monetarist view, which is different from Keynesian.

D: Fiscal policy has no impact on the economy. Again, this is incorrect because Keynesians believe fiscal policy does have significant impacts.

E: The FED should decrease the money supply to combat inflation. This sounds like a standard monetary policy approach, perhaps more aligned with monetarists or classical views, but I'm not sure if it's directly a Keynesian stance.

F: Changes in the money supply have no significant effects. I think Keynesians might not deny the effect, but they might focus more on fiscal measures, so maybe this is incorrect.

G: The FED should not conduct monetary policy. That doesn't seem right. Keynesians would support the FED using monetary policy, but they might also emphasize fiscal policy as a more potent tool.

H: The FED should conduct fiscal policy. Wait, the FED is responsible for monetary policy, not fiscal policy. So this is incorrect because fiscal policy is conducted by the government, not the central bank.

I: Fiscal policy is the preferred way of shifting the aggregate demand curve. Yes, this aligns with Keynesian theory. They believe that through government spending and taxation, you can shift AD to address economic issues like unemployment or inflation.

J: The FED should increase the money supply to combat unemployment. While increasing the money supply might help, Keynesians might prefer fiscal measures for unemployment. Plus, the FED's role is monetary policy, not directly combating unemployment through fiscal means.

So, putting it together, the correct answer should be I because it directly states that fiscal policy is the preferred method for shifting the aggregate demand curve, which is a core Keynesian belief.

The correct answer is I: fiscal policy is the preferred way of shifting the aggregate demand curve.
