Question:

An accounting professor has been called as a defense expert witness in a white-collar criminal case. He testified that accounting records conclusively demonstrated that the defendant had not committed any type of fraud. On cross-examination of the professor, the prosecuting attorney asked him if he was familiar with a particular treatise. The professor responded affirmatively. The attorney then asked him if the treatise was accepted as authoritative and if he was aware of the conclusions regarding the ability of accountants to detect fraud. The professor responded in the affirmative. The prosecutor now attempts to read the following section of the treatise into evidence: "It is virtually impossible to state with conclusive certainty the existence, or lack thereof, of fraud in the majority of white-collar crime cases, given the sophistication of defendants and the variety of accounting methods available. "On objection by the defendant's attorney, the trial judge will

Options:

A: sustain the objection, because the professor did not rely on the treatise in making his conclusions.
B: sustain the objection, because the statements in the treatise are hearsay not within any recognized exception.
C: overrule the objection and permit the prosecutor to ask the professor about the treatise.
D: sustain the objection, because the prosecutor's question is leading.
E: sustain the objection, because the treatise is not relevant to the professor's testimony.
F: overrule the objection, because the treatise is considered a reliable source in the field of accounting.
G: overrule the objection, because the professor confirmed the treatise's authority.
H: overrule the objection and permit the entire treatise to be introduced into evidence.
I: sustain the objection, because the treatise's statements are opinion-based.
J: overrule the objection and permit only the contradictory statements to be read into evidence.

Okay, so I have this question about evidence law, specifically dealing with a scenario in a criminal trial. The question revolves around whether a judge will sustain or overrule an objection when a treatise is being offered into evidence. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's go through the scenario again to make sure I understand it correctly. An accounting professor is testifying as a defense expert witness. He says that accounting records conclusively show the defendant didn't commit fraud. On cross-examination, the prosecutor asks the professor if he's familiar with a particular treatise, and the professor says yes. Then the prosecutor asks if the treatise is considered authoritative and if he's aware of its conclusions about accountants detecting fraud. The professor agrees again. Now, the prosecutor wants to read a section of the treatise into evidence that says it's virtually impossible to state with conclusive certainty whether fraud exists in most cases due to the defendants' sophistication and various accounting methods.

The defense objects, and the question is what the judge will do.

So, the key issue here is the admissibility of the treatise under evidence law. I remember that in court, expert witnesses can rely on various sources, including treatises, provided they meet certain criteria. Treatises are often considered reliable, especially if they're recognized in the field. 

I'm trying to recall the rules about using treatises as evidence. I think there's a rule, maybe under the Federal Rules of Evidence, that allows a treatise to be used if it's established that the treatise is reliable and authoritative in the field. The key here is whether the treatise is being used to support the expert's opinion or as substantive evidence.

Wait, the professor is the expert. He's already given his opinion based on the records. The treatise is being offered by the prosecutor. But the professor has already acknowledged the treatise is authoritative and aware of its conclusions. So, the treatise is being offered through the professor's knowledge.

But wait, the rule about using a treatise in court: under FRE 803(18), a treatise can be used as substantive evidence if it's established that it's a reliable authority in the field. But for an expert to testify about it, the opposing party can question the expert about it. However, in this case, the prosecutor is trying to read the treatise into evidence over the objection.

Wait, the professor is the defense's witness. The prosecutor is cross-examining him. The professor has already admitted familiarity with the treatise, and that it's authoritative. So the question is whether the prosecutor can now read the specific section into evidence.

I think the key is whether the treatise is admissible as an exception to hearsay. Because the treatise is being offered for its truth, that would typically be hearsay unless an exception applies. The exception in 803(18) allows for the use of treatises if they're established as reliable. But wait, that's when the treatise is being offered by the proponent. Here, the prosecutor is trying to read it, but the defense is opposing it.

Wait, the defense's objection is likely on hearsay grounds. So the argument would be that the treatise is hearsay and not admissible unless an exception applies. But the professor has already acknowledged the treatise's authority, so maybe the exception applies.

Alternatively, maybe the issue is whether the treatise is being used to contradict the expert's opinion. The professor said the records conclusively demonstrate no fraud, but the treatise says it's impossible to be certain. So the treatise could be used to impeach the professor's conclusion.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: Sustain because professor didn't rely on the treatise. But the professor did rely on it in the sense he's aware of its conclusions, but he didn't use it for his own opinion. So maybe this is about whether the treatise can be used to contradict his opinion.

B: Sustain because it's hearsay not within an exception. But if the treatise is authoritative, 803(18) might apply, so this might not be correct.

C: Overrule and permit the prosecutor to ask about the treatise. But the question is about reading it into evidence, not just asking the professor about it.

D: Sustain because leading question. But the question here is about the treatise's admissibility, not whether the question is leading.

E: Sustain because not relevant. But the treatise seems relevant because it's about the ability to detect fraud, which relates to the professor's testimony.

F: Overrule because treatise is reliable. This seems possible.

G: Overrule because professor confirmed its authority. That sounds like the 803(18) exception, as the expert has acknowledged the treatise is authoritative.

H: Overrule and permit the entire treatise. That seems too broad; the question is about a specific section.

I: Sustain because opinion-based. Treatises are considered reliable, but their contents are factual statements, not opinions. Or are they?

J: Overrule and permit only contradictory parts. Maybe, but the problem is about admissibility in general.

So, the main issue is whether the treatise is admissible as an exception to hearsay under 803(18). The professor has acknowledged it's authoritative, so the exception might apply. Therefore, the judge would overrule the objection, allowing the treatise to be read into evidence. So option G seems correct.

Wait, but the professor is the defense's witness. The defense might argue that the treatise isn't being used by their own expert, so the exception doesn't apply. Or does the exception apply regardless of who offers it?

Looking back, 803(18) allows the treatise to be used as substantive evidence by either side. So even if the defense's expert is aware of it, the prosecution can offer it as evidence. So the judge would overrule the objection because the treatise is authoritative and the professor has confirmed that. So the answer would be G.

Alternatively, could it be B? If the judge thinks it's hearsay and not within an exception. But the professor's acknowledgment makes 803(18) applicable, so B is incorrect.

So, the correct answer should be G: the judge overrules the objection because the professor confirmed the treatise's authority.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a treatise in evidence law during a criminal trial. The key issue is whether the treatise, offered by the prosecution, is admissible despite the defense's objection. The professor, a defense expert, acknowledged the treatise's authority during cross-examination. 

Under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(18), a treatise is admissible as substantive evidence if it is established as a reliable authority in the field. The professor's confirmation of the treatise's authority supports its admissibility under this exception to hearsay. Therefore, the judge should overrule the objection, as the treatise is considered authoritative and relevant to the professor's testimony.
