<think>
Okay, so I've got this problem to find the curvature of a vector function r(t) at a specific value of t. Let me think through this step by step. 

The vector function given is r(t) = 5cos(t)i + 4sin(t)j + 3tk. I need to find the curvature when t = 4π/3. Hmm, I remember that curvature is a measure of how much the curve deviates from being a straight line. The formula for curvature κ of a vector function r(t) is:

κ = |r'(t) × r''(t)| / |r'(t)|³

So, my first step is to find the first and second derivatives of r(t).

Let's start with r'(t), the first derivative. The derivative of 5cos(t) with respect to t is -5sin(t), right? And the derivative of 4sin(t) is 4cos(t). The derivative of 3t is 3. So putting it all together, r'(t) = -5sin(t)i + 4cos(t)j + 3k.

Next, I need r''(t), the second derivative. Taking the derivative of r'(t): the derivative of -5sin(t) is -5cos(t), the derivative of 4cos(t) is -4sin(t), and the derivative of 3 is 0. So r''(t) = -5cos(t)i -4sin(t)j + 0k, which simplifies to -5cos(t)i -4sin(t)j.

Now, I need to compute the cross product of r'(t) and r''(t). The cross product of two vectors a = a1i + a2j + a3k and b = b1i + b2j + b3k is given by the determinant of a 3x3 matrix with the standard unit vectors in the first row, the components of a in the second, and the components of b in the third.

So, r'(t) × r''(t) would be:

|i     j     k|
|-5s   4c    3|
|-5c  -4s    0|

Expanding this determinant:

i*(4c*0 - 3*(-4s)) - j*(-5s*0 - 3*(-5c)) + k*(-5s*(-4s) - 4c*(-5c)).

Let me compute each component:

For the i component: 4c*0 is 0, and -3*(-4s) is 12s. So i*(0 + 12s) = 12s i.

For the j component: the formula is - [ (-5s)*0 - 3*(-5c) ] which is - [0 + 15c] = -15c j. Wait, no, the formula is (a2b3 - a3b2), but since it's the j component, it's subtracted. So the j component is - [ (-5s)(0) - (3)(-5c) ] = - [0 + 15c] = -15c j.

Wait, no, let me double-check that. The cross product formula for the j component is -(a1*b3 - a3*b1). So in this case, a1 is -5s, a3 is 3, b1 is -5c, b3 is 0. So it's - [ (-5s)(0) - (3)(-5c) ) ] = - [ 0 + 15c ] = -15c. So the j component is -15c j.

Wait, but I'm getting confused here. Let me make sure. The j component in the cross product is negative of (a1*b3 - a3*b1). So:

a1 is -5s, b3 is 0; a3 is 3, b1 is -5c.

So (a1*b3 - a3*b1) = (-5s*0) - (3*(-5c)) = 0 + 15c =15c.

So the j component is -(15c)j, which is -15c j.

Okay, moving on to the k component:

a2 is 4c, b2 is -4s; a1 is -5s, b1 is -5c.

So (a2*b1 - a1*b2) = (4c*(-5c)) - (-5s*(-4s)).

Calculating each term:

4c*(-5c) = -20c².

-5s*(-4s) = 20s². But since it's a2*b1 - a1*b2, it's (-20c²) - (20s²) = -20c² - 20s².

So the k component is (-20c² -20s²)k. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me redo this part.

Wait, the k component is (a2*b1 - a1*b2). So a2 is 4c, b1 is -5c. a1 is -5s, b2 is -4s.

So a2*b1 = 4c*(-5c) = -20c².

a1*b2 = (-5s)*(-4s) = 20s².

So (a2*b1 - a1*b2) = (-20c²) - (20s²) = -20(c² + s²). But since c² + s² =1, this becomes -20*1 = -20.

So the k component is -20k.

Putting it all together, the cross product r'(t) × r''(t) is:

12s i -15c j -20k.

Now, I need the magnitude of this cross product vector. The magnitude is sqrt( (12s)^2 + (-15c)^2 + (-20)^2 ).

Calculating each term:

(12s)^2 = 144s².

(-15c)^2 = 225c².

(-20)^2 = 400.

So the magnitude squared is 144s² + 225c² + 400.

But since s² + c² =1, let's see if we can simplify this:

144s² +225c² = 144(s² + c²) + 81c² = 144(1) +81c² = 144 +81c².

Wait, that doesn't seem helpful. Alternatively, perhaps factor out something else.

Alternatively, perhaps compute it directly.

Next, I need the magnitude of r'(t). Let's compute |r'(t)|.

r'(t) is -5s i +4c j +3k.

So |r'(t)| = sqrt( (-5s)^2 + (4c)^2 +3^2 ) = sqrt(25s² + 16c² +9).

Again, since s² + c² =1, let's see:

25s² +16c² = 25(s² + c²) -9c² =25(1) -9c²=25-9c².

So |r'(t)| = sqrt(25 -9c² +9) = sqrt(34 -9c²).

Wait, that's correct. So |r'(t)| = sqrt(34 -9c²).

Now, the curvature κ is |r'(t) × r''(t)| / |r'(t)|³.

So let's compute |r'(t) × r''(t)| first.

From earlier, |r'(t) × r''(t)| = sqrt(144s² +225c² +400).

Let me compute this expression:

144s² +225c² +400 = 144s² +225c² +400.

I can factor out 9:

= 9*(16s² +25c²) +400.

Wait, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps we can evaluate it at t=4π/3.

Wait, yes, because the problem asks for the curvature at t=4π/3. So maybe it's easier to compute each component at that specific t value before taking the magnitudes.

That might be a smarter approach. Let me try that.

So, t =4π/3.

First, let's compute sin(t) and cos(t) at t=4π/3.

4π/3 is in the third quadrant, where both sine and cosine are negative.

cos(4π/3) = cos(π + π/3) = -cos(π/3) = -1/2.

sin(4π/3) = sin(π + π/3) = -sin(π/3) = -√3/2.

So s = sin(t) = -√3/2.

c = cos(t) = -1/2.

Now, let's compute each part.

First, compute r'(t) at t=4π/3.

r'(t) = -5s i +4c j +3k.

s = -√3/2, c = -1/2.

So:

-5s = -5*(-√3/2) = (5√3)/2.

4c =4*(-1/2) = -2.

So r'(t) at t=4π/3 is (5√3/2)i - 2j +3k.

Similarly, r''(t) = -5c i -4s j.

c = -1/2, s=-√3/2.

So:

-5c = -5*(-1/2) =5/2.

-4s = -4*(-√3/2) = 2√3.

So r''(t) is (5/2)i +2√3 j.

Now, compute the cross product r'(t) × r''(t).

r'(t) = (5√3/2)i -2j +3k.

r''(t) = (5/2)i +2√3 j +0k.

So the cross product is:

|i          j          k|
|5√3/2     -2          3|
|5/2      2√3         0|

Calculating the determinant:

i * [(-2)(0) - 3*(2√3)] - j * [(5√3/2)(0) -3*(5/2)] + k * [(5√3/2)(2√3) - (-2)(5/2)].

Let me compute each term:

i component: (-2)(0) =0, 3*(2√3)=6√3. So 0 -6√3 = -6√3. i * (-6√3) = -6√3 i.

j component: The formula is - [ (5√3/2)(0) -3*(5/2) ) ].

(5√3/2)(0)=0, 3*(5/2)=15/2. So 0 -15/2 = -15/2. Since it's subtracted, it becomes -(-15/2) =15/2. So j component is 15/2 j.

Wait, no: the cross product's j component is negative of (a1*b3 - a3*b1).

a1 is 5√3/2, b3 is 0; a3 is 3, b1 is 5/2.

So (a1*b3 -a3*b1) = (5√3/2 *0) - (3*(5/2)) = 0 -15/2 = -15/2.

So the j component is -(-15/2) j = 15/2 j.

k component: (a2*b1 - a1*b2).

a2 is -2, b1 is 5/2; a1 is 5√3/2, b2 is 2√3.

So (-2)*(5/2) = -5.

(5√3/2)*(2√3) = (5√3 *2√3)/(2) = (5*2*3)/2 = 30/2 =15.

So (a2*b1 - a1*b2) = -5 -15 = -20.

Thus, the k component is -20k.

So the cross product r'(t) × r''(t) is:

-6√3 i + (15/2) j -20k.

Now, compute the magnitude of this vector.

|r'(t) × r''(t)| = sqrt( (-6√3)^2 + (15/2)^2 + (-20)^2 ).

Calculating each term:

(-6√3)^2 = (6√3)^2 =36*3=108.

(15/2)^2 =225/4=56.25.

(-20)^2=400.

Adding them up: 108 +56.25 +400 = 564.25.

So |r'(t) × r''(t)| = sqrt(564.25). Let me compute this.

I know that 23^2=529 and 24^2=576. So sqrt(564.25) is between 23 and 24.

Compute 23.7^2: 23*23=529, 0.7^2=0.49, 2*23*0.7=32.2. So 529 +32.2 +0.49=561.69.

Hmm, 23.7^2=561.69, which is less than 564.25.

Try 23.8^2: 23^2=529, 0.8^2=0.64, 2*23*0.8=36.8.

So 529 +36.8 +0.64=566.44. That's higher than 564.25.

So sqrt(564.25) is between 23.7 and 23.8.

Compute 23.75^2: (23 +0.75)^2 =23^2 +2*23*0.75 +0.75^2=529 +34.5 +0.5625=564.0625.

That's very close to 564.25. The difference is 564.25 -564.0625=0.1875.

So 23.75^2=564.0625, and each 0.01 increase in x adds approximately 2*23.75*0.01 + (0.01)^2 ≈0.475 +0.0001=0.4751. So to get an additional 0.1875, how much more?

0.1875 /0.4751 ≈0.394. So sqrt(564.25)≈23.75 +0.00394≈23.75394. But let's just keep it as sqrt(564.25) for now.

Alternatively, 564.25 = 2257/4, since 564.25 *4=2257. Hmm, perhaps that's not helpful.

Now, compute |r'(t)| at t=4π/3.

r'(t) is (5√3/2)i -2j +3k.

So |r'(t)| = sqrt( (5√3/2)^2 + (-2)^2 +3^2 ).

Compute each term:

(5√3/2)^2 = (25*3)/4=75/4=18.75.

(-2)^2=4.

3^2=9.

Adding them up:18.75 +4 +9=31.75.

So |r'(t)|=sqrt(31.75).

sqrt(31.75) is between 5 and 6. 5^2=25, 6^2=36. 5.6^2=31.36, 5.7^2=32.49.

So 5.6^2=31.36, which is less than 31.75. The difference is 31.75-31.36=0.39.

Each 0.01 increase adds about 2*5.6*0.01=0.112. So 0.39/0.112≈3.48. So sqrt(31.75)=approximately 5.6 +0.0348=5.6348.

But for precise calculation, perhaps better to compute |r'(t)|³.

Wait, but maybe I can compute it as 31.75. Let me see:

|r'(t)|³= (sqrt(31.75))³ = (31.75)^(3/2).

But perhaps it's easier to compute numerically.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the curvature as |r'(t) × r''(t)| / |r'(t)|³.

So κ = sqrt(564.25) / (sqrt(31.75))³.

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

First, compute |r'(t)| = sqrt(31.75) ≈5.635.

Then, |r'(t)|³ ≈5.635^3.

Compute 5^3=125. 5.635^3 = ?

5.635 *5.635 = let's compute:

5 *5 =25.

5 *0.635=3.175.

0.635*5=3.175.

0.635*0.635≈0.4032.

So (5 +0.635)^2 =5^2 +2*5*0.635 +0.635^2=25 +6.35 +0.4032≈31.7532.

Wait, that's just |r'(t)| squared, which is 31.75, which checks out.

Then, 5.635^3 =5.635 *31.7532 ≈ let's compute 5*31.7532=158.766, 0.635*31.7532≈20.225. So total ≈158.766 +20.225≈178.991.

So |r'(t)|³≈178.991.

Now, |r'(t) × r''(t)|=sqrt(564.25)=approximately 23.7539 as before.

So κ=23.7539 / 178.991 ≈ let's compute this.

23.7539 ÷178.991.

Well, 178.991 ÷10=17.8991. So 23.7539 ÷178.991 ≈ (23.7539 ÷17.8991)/10.

23.7539 ÷17.8991 ≈1.328.

So κ≈1.328 /10=0.1328.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B:0.13 or F:0.14. Hmm, 0.1328 is approximately 0.133, which rounds to 0.13 if we're keeping two decimal places, but perhaps I should check my calculations for any errors.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the cross product. Let me double-check the cross product calculation.

Earlier, when I calculated the cross product at t=4π/3, I got:

r'(t) × r''(t) = -6√3 i + (15/2) j -20k.

Wait, let me recompute that part.

r'(t) = (5√3/2)i -2j +3k.

r''(t) = (5/2)i +2√3 j.

So the cross product is:

|i          j          k|
|5√3/2     -2          3|
|5/2      2√3         0|

Compute each component:

i component: (-2)(0) -3*(2√3) =0 -6√3= -6√3.

j component: - [ (5√3/2*0) -3*(5/2) ) ] = - [0 -15/2] = - (-15/2) =15/2.

k component: (5√3/2)*(2√3) - (-2)*(5/2).

Compute each part:

(5√3/2)*(2√3) =5√3 *√3 =5*3=15.

(-2)*(5/2)= -5.

So (5√3/2)*(2√3) - (-2)*(5/2) =15 - (-5) =20.

Wait, but earlier I had -20k. Did I make a mistake here?

Wait, no, because the formula for the k component is a2*b1 - a1*b2.

a2 is -2, b1 is 5/2.

a1 is5√3/2, b2 is2√3.

So a2*b1 = (-2)*(5/2)= -5.

a1*b2 = (5√3/2)*(2√3)= (5√3 *2√3)/(2) = (5*2*3)/2 =30/2=15.

So a2*b1 - a1*b2 = (-5) -15 = -20.

Wait, so the k component is -20k. So my earlier calculation was correct.

So the cross product is -6√3 i +15/2 j -20k.

So the magnitude squared is (-6√3)^2 + (15/2)^2 + (-20)^2.

Which is 36*3=108, (225/4)=56.25, and 400. Adding them together gives 108+56.25=164.25 +400=564.25.

So |r'(t) × r''(t)| = sqrt(564.25) ≈23.7539.

|r'(t)| is sqrt(31.75) ≈5.6349.

So |r'(t)|^3 ≈5.6349^3.

Wait, earlier I approximated it as 178.991, but perhaps a more accurate calculation would help.

Let me compute 5.6349^3.

First, 5.6349^2= (5.6349)^2 ≈31.75, as before.

Then, 5.6349 *31.75.

Compute 5*31.75=158.75.

0.6349*31.75: Let's compute 0.6*31.75=19.05, 0.0349*31.75≈1.102.

So total ≈19.05+1.102=20.152.

So 5.6349^3 ≈158.75 +20.152=178.902.

So |r'(t)|^3≈178.902.

Now, κ=23.7539 / 178.902 ≈0.1328.

Rounding to two decimal places, that's 0.13.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.13.

Wait, but let me check if I computed |r'(t)| correctly.

|r'(t)|=sqrt( (5√3/2)^2 + (-2)^2 +3^2 ).

(5√3/2)^2=25*3/4=75/4=18.75.

(-2)^2=4.

3^2=9.

Total:18.75+4=22.75 +9=31.75. So yes, correct.

So the curvature is approximately 0.1328, which is about 0.13 when rounded to two decimal places. So the correct answer is option B:0.13.

To find the curvature of the vector function \( \mathbf{r}(t) = 5\cos(t)\mathbf{i} + 4\sin(t)\mathbf{j} + 3t\mathbf{k} \) at \( t = \frac{4\pi}{3} \), we use the formula for curvature:

\[
\kappa = \frac{|\mathbf{r}'(t) \times \mathbf{r}''(t)|}{|\mathbf{r}'(t)|^3}
\]

**Step 1: Compute \( \mathbf{r}'(t) \) and \( \mathbf{r}''(t) \)**
\[
\mathbf{r}'(t) = -5\sin(t)\mathbf{i} + 4\cos(t)\mathbf{j} + 3\mathbf{k}
\]
\[
\mathbf{r}''(t) = -5\cos(t)\mathbf{i} - 4\sin(t)\mathbf{j}
\]

**Step 2: Evaluate \( \mathbf{r}'(t) \) and \( \mathbf{r}''(t) \) at \( t = \frac{4\pi}{3} \)**
At \( t = \frac{4\pi}{3} \):
\[
\sin\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \quad \cos\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right) = -\frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\mathbf{r}'\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right) = \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{2}\mathbf{i} - 2\mathbf{j} + 3\mathbf{k}
\]
\[
\mathbf{r}''\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right) = \frac{5}{2}\mathbf{i} + 2\sqrt{3}\mathbf{j}
\]

**Step 3: Compute the cross product \( \mathbf{r}'(t) \times \mathbf{r}''(t) \)**
\[
\mathbf{r}'(t) \times \mathbf{r}''(t) = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
\frac{5\sqrt{3}}{2} & -2 & 3 \\
\frac{5}{2} & 2\sqrt{3} & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]
\[
= -6\sqrt{3}\mathbf{i} + \frac{15}{2}\mathbf{j} - 20\mathbf{k}
\]

**Step 4: Find the magnitude of the cross product**
\[
|\mathbf{r}'(t) \times \mathbf{r}''(t)| = \sqrt{(-6\sqrt{3})^2 + \left(\frac{15}{2}\right)^2 + (-20)^2} = \sqrt{564.25} \approx 23.75
\]

**Step 5: Compute \( |\mathbf{r}'(t)| \) and \( |\mathbf{r}'(t)|^3 \)**
\[
|\mathbf{r}'(t)| = \sqrt{\left(\frac{5\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 + (-2)^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{31.75} \approx 5.635
\]
\[
|\mathbf{r}'(t)|^3 \approx 5.635^3 \approx 178.991
\]

**Step 6: Calculate the curvature**
\[
\kappa = \frac{23.75}{178.991} \approx 0.1328
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, the curvature is approximately \( 0.13 \).

**Answer:** B
