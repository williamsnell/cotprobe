Okay, so I have this question about developmental psychology and the primary research methods they use. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

First, I remember that developmental psychology deals with how people grow and change throughout their lives. So the methods they use probably involve tracking changes over time. I've heard terms like longitudinal studies and cross-sectional studies before. Longitudinal research involves following the same group of people over an extended period, right? That makes sense because you can see how they develop and change.

Looking at the options, C is longitudinal research, and I is cross-sectional. I know cross-sectional is when you study people of different ages at the same time, like snapshot data. But I think the primary method is longitudinal because it captures the changes more directly.

Other options: A is psychoanalysis, which I think is more of a therapeutic approach rather than a research method. B is self-report inventories, which are used but might not be the primary. D is naturalistic observation, which is observing without interference, but maybe more common in other areas like animal behavior.

E and F both mention experimental method. Wait, E is experimental method and F is experimentation. Maybe they're the same? Or perhaps F is a typo. But experimental methods involve manipulating variables, which is common in many areas of psychology, but I'm not sure if it's the primary for developmental.

G is correlational research, which looks at relationships between variables. That's useful, but again, not sure if primary. H is survey research, which gathers data through surveys, but that's more about current status rather than tracking over time.

J is case study, which involves in-depth analysis of a single case. That's useful for detailed understanding but not the primary method for broader developmental trends.

So putting it together, the primary method for developmental psychologists is likely longitudinal research because they need to track changes and development over periods, which is exactly what longitudinal studies do. So the answer should be C.

The primary research method used by developmental psychologists is longitudinal research, as it allows them to track changes and development over time.
