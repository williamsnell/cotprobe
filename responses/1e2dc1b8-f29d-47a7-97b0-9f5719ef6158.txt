The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Whether the question be to continue or to discontinue the practice of sati, the decision is equally surrounded by an awful responsibility. To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.
William Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, "On the Suppression of Sati," 1829
I have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].
George Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, 1826

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out which commonly held assumption about Western imperialism the first passage undermines. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll look at the first passage. It's from William Bentinck, the Governor-General of India in 1829. He's talking about sati, which is the practice of widow immolation in India. He mentions the dilemma of whether to continue or discontinue the practice. He argues against continuing it because it's causing innocent people to suffer cruelly. However, he also cautions that if they take a contrary approach, it might put the safety of the British Empire in India at risk. But he concludes that now that they are supreme, he's in favor of an open prohibition of sati.

So, the key point here is that Bentinck is taking a stance against a native religious practice, sati, and wants to suppress it. This shows that the British, at least in this case, were interfering with native religious practices by banning sati.

Now, looking at the question: the first passage undermines a commonly held assumption about Western imperialism. The options are A to D. Let's go through them.

Option A: That European colonizers sometimes interfered with native religious practices. Wait, if the passage is about interfering with sati, that actually supports this assumption. So the passage doesn't undermine A; it supports it.

Option B: That European colonizers concerned themselves deeply with turning profits. The passage talks about moral concerns (sati) and the safety of the empire. There's no mention of profits here, so B doesn't seem relevant.

Option C: That European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations. The passage shows that the British did interfere with native practices, which might suggest they were eager to impose their norms. But the question is about which assumption is undermined, meaning the passage shows the opposite. Wait, noâ€”if the passage supports that they interfered, then it doesn't undermine the assumption that they were eager. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Option D: That European colonizers often resorted to armed force to impose their will. The passage doesn't mention using armed force; it's about using legal prohibition (like an open and general ban). So D isn't supported here.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. The question is about which assumption the passage undermines. The commonly held assumptions are about what people generally think about Western imperialism. So, if the assumption is that colonizers sometimes interfered with religious practices, then the passage actually supports that, so it doesn't undermine it. Therefore, the passage must be challenging another assumption.

Wait, perhaps the assumption that colonizers were always eager to impose their cultural norms isn't the case here. Or maybe the passage shows that they did interfere, which might go against an assumption that they didn't interfere, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the passage undermines the assumption that colonizers were uniformly (always) eager to force their norms. Because in some cases, like this, they did interfere, but maybe the assumption is that they were always doing it, or that they were more focused on other things. Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, the question is which assumption is undermined. So if the commonly held assumption is that colonizers sometimes interfered with native religious practices, then the passage supports that, so it doesn't undermine it. Therefore, the answer can't be A.

Looking again, the question is about the first passage, which is about suppressing sati. So the assumption that the passage undermines must be something else.

Wait, perhaps the assumption is that colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms. If the passage shows that sometimes they did interfere, but maybe the assumption is that they were always doing it, or that they were more focused on other things. Alternatively, perhaps the passage shows that they were willing to interfere, which might go against an assumption that they didn't interfere much.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of it this way: the passage shows that the British did interfere with a native religious practice, which would support the idea that they sometimes interfered. So if the commonly held assumption is that they often interfered, then the passage supports it. But if the assumption is that they didn't interfere much, then the passage undermines that assumption.

Wait, the question is about which assumption is undermined. So perhaps the answer is A, because the passage shows that they did interfere, which would go against an assumption that they didn't. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe the passage undermines the assumption that colonizers were uniformly eager to force their norms. Because while some did, others might have not. But the passage itself shows that at least in this case, they did interfere, so it supports the idea that they sometimes did, but doesn't necessarily undermine the assumption that they were uniformly eager.

Wait, perhaps the answer is C: That European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations. If the passage shows that they did interfere, perhaps it's challenging the assumption that they were uniformly eager. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the passage doesn't directly address whether they were uniformly eager but rather shows that they did interfere, which might not necessarily undermine the assumption but rather support it. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, another approach: the first passage is about the suppression of sati, which is a religious practice. So the assumption that the passage undermines is that colonizers sometimes interfered with native religious practices. But wait, the passage actually supports that assumption, so it doesn't undermine it. Therefore, the answer can't be A.

Wait, perhaps the question is about which assumption is commonly held but is being contradicted by the passage. So if the assumption is that colonizers didn't interfere much, then the passage undermines that by showing they did.

But the options given are A to D. Let me read the options again.

Option A: That European colonizers sometimes interfered with native religious practices.

Option C: That European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations.

So, the passage shows that they did interfere, which supports A. So the passage doesn't undermine A; it supports it. Therefore, the answer isn't A.

So, perhaps the passage supports the idea that they interfered, but the assumption that needs to be undermined is that they were uniformly eager (C). Wait, no. The passage shows that they did interfere, which would support C. So perhaps the passage doesn't undermine C but supports it.

Wait, maybe the passage is an example of interference, so the commonly held assumption is that colonizers sometimes interfered. But if the passage is about that, it's supporting the assumption, not undermining it.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The question is asking which assumption is undermined by the first passage. So if the passage shows that the British did interfere with native religious practices, then the assumption that they didn't interfere would be undermined. But the options don't have that.

Looking back, the options are:

A: That European colonizers sometimes interfered with native religious practices.

B: That European colonizers concerned themselves deeply with turning profits.

C: That European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations.

D: That European colonizers often resorted to armed force to impose their will on imperial subjects.

So the passage supports A, as it's about interfering with sati. Therefore, the passage doesn't undermine A. It supports A, meaning A is a correct assumption, not one that's being undermined.

So the question is, which assumption is the passage undermining. So perhaps the answer is C. Because the passage shows that the British were eager to impose their norms (by banning sati), which supports C. But if the assumption is that they were uniformly eager, perhaps the passage shows that at least in this case, they were, but that doesn't necessarily undermine the assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the passage undermines the assumption that they were uniformly eager, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the passage is an example of interference, so the commonly held assumption is that they sometimes interfered, which is supported by the passage, so it doesn't undermine it. Therefore, the answer must be another option.

Wait, perhaps the passage is about the moral aspect, not necessarily about forcing cultural norms. The author is concerned about the moral responsibility, which might suggest that they were interfering because of moral reasons, not just cultural imposition. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the passage is more about the power dynamics, like the British being supreme and thus able to impose their will, which might relate to the assumption that they often used armed force. But the passage doesn't mention using force; it's about using legal prohibition.

So, if the assumption is that they often used armed force (D), the passage doesn't support that, so it might undermine D. But the passage doesn't say anything about armed force, so perhaps D isn't the right answer.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think of it differently. The first passage is about the suppression of sati, which is a religious practice. So the assumption that is commonly held is that colonizers sometimes interfered with religious practices. The passage shows that they did, so it supports A, meaning A is not the answer because the question is about which assumption is undermined.

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased as "the first passage can be said to undermine which commonly held assumption." So if the assumption is that colonizers sometimes interfered, the passage actually supports that, so it doesn't undermine it. Therefore, the answer must be another option.

Wait, maybe the assumption is that colonizers were concerned with profits, and the passage is about moral concerns, so it undermines B. But the passage says that expediency (which could relate to profits) might recommend a cautious approach, but now that they're supreme, they're going to prohibit it. So perhaps the passage is showing that they were concerned with more than just profits, which might undermine the assumption that they were deeply concerned with profits. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the passage is about the moral stance, which might not directly relate to profits. So maybe B isn't the right answer.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of it this way: the first passage is about the moral dilemma of suppressing sati. The author is arguing that even though it's a tough decision, they must prohibit it. This shows that the British were interfering with native practices, which supports the idea that they sometimes did interfere. So the commonly held assumption is that they sometimes interfered (A). But the question is which assumption is undermined. If the passage supports A, then it doesn't undermine it. Therefore, the answer must be another option.

Wait, perhaps the assumption is that colonizers were uniformly eager to impose their norms, but the passage shows that they had a dilemma and were cautious before taking action. So maybe it undermines the assumption that they were uniformly eager, as in this case, they were considering the consequences and not just rushing to impose their norms. Therefore, the passage undermines C: That European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the passage doesn't undermine C because it does show that they were eager to impose their norms by prohibiting sati.

Wait, perhaps the answer is C because the passage shows that they did interfere, which supports the assumption that they were eager, so it doesn't undermine it. Therefore, the answer must be another option.

I'm getting a bit confused, but I think the best answer is A. Wait, but the passage supports A, so it doesn't undermine it. Therefore, the answer must be another option.

Wait, perhaps the answer is C. The passage shows that the British were willing to interfere, which might go against the assumption that they were uniformly eager. No, that doesn't make sense. The passage supports C, so it doesn't undermine it.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the passage again. It's about the moral responsibility to suppress sati. The author is Governor-General Bentinck, and he's making a decision to prohibit it. This shows that the British did interfere with native religious practices, which supports A. Therefore, the passage doesn't undermine A; it supports it. So the answer must be another option.

Wait, perhaps the assumption is that they were concerned with profits, and the passage is about moral considerations, so it undermines B. But the passage mentions expediency, which could relate to profits, but then says that now they're supreme, so they can prohibit it regardless. So maybe it's a bit of both, but I'm not sure.

I think I've spent enough time on this. Based on the passage, the answer is A. Wait, no, because the passage supports A, so it doesn't undermine it. Therefore, the answer must be C. I'm not entirely confident, but I'll go with C.

The first passage discusses the suppression of sati, a native religious practice, by William Bentinck, the Governor-General of India. This indicates that the British interfered with native religious practices. The question asks which commonly held assumption about Western imperialism this passage undermines. 

Option A suggests that European colonizers sometimes interfered with native religious practices. However, the passage supports this assumption rather than undermining it, as it explicitly shows interference with sati. Therefore, A is not the correct answer.

Option B states that European colonizers were deeply concerned with turning profits. The passage focuses on moral and safety concerns rather than profits, which might suggest it undermines B. However, the passage does mention "expediency," which could relate to profits, making this option less clear.

Option C posits that European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations. The passage shows the British did interfere, supporting the idea that they were eager to impose their norms. Thus, it does not undermine C.

Option D claims that European colonizers often resorted to armed force to impose their will. The passage discusses a legal prohibition, not armed force, which might suggest it undermines D. However, there is no explicit mention of armed force, making this option less direct.

After considering all options, the passage most directly supports the idea that colonizers interfered with native religious practices, aligning with A. However, since the question asks which assumption is undermined, and the passage does not challenge the assumption that colonizers were uniformly eager to impose their norms (C), the answer is:

C
