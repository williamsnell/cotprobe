Question:

Let X be the random variable denoting the result of the single toss of a fair coin. If the toss is heads, X = 1. If the toss results in tails, X = 0. What is the probability distribution of X?

Options:

A: f(0) = (0) and f(1) = (1)
B: f(0) = (1/2) and f(1) = (1/2)
C: f(0) = (1) and f(1) = (0)
D: f(0) = (1/6) and f(1) = (5/6)
E: f(0) = (2/5) and f(1) = (3/5)
F: f(0) = (3/7) and f(1) = (4/7)
G: f(0) = (1/5) and f(1) = (4/5)
H: f(0) = (1/4) and f(1) = (3/4)
I: f(0) = (1/3) and f(1) = (2/3)
J: f(0) = (3/8) and f(1) = (5/8)

Okay, so I've got this probability question here about a coin toss. Let me try to figure this out step by step. The question is asking about the probability distribution of a random variable X, which represents the outcome of a single toss of a fair coin. If it's heads, X equals 1, and if it's tails, X equals 0.

Hmm, I remember that a probability distribution for a discrete random variable lists all possible outcomes and their corresponding probabilities. Since it's a fair coin, I think each side has an equal chance of landing face up. But wait, let me make sure.

So, a fair coin has two sides: heads and tails. When you toss it, there are two possible outcomes. If it's fair, the probability of getting heads should be the same as getting tails. So each outcome should have a probability of 1/2, right? Because 1 divided by 2 possible outcomes equals 0.5 for each.

Let me think again. The random variable X can be 0 or 1. So I need to find f(0) and f(1), which are the probabilities that X takes on those values. Since there are only two outcomes and the coin is fair, both f(0) and f(1) should be equal. And since probabilities must add up to 1, each should be 1/2.

Looking at the options, option B says f(0) = 1/2 and f(1) = 1/2. That seems right. Let me check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something.

Option A says f(0)=0 and f(1)=1. That would mean the coin always lands on heads, which isn't the case for a fair coin. So A is wrong.

Option C has f(0)=1 and f(1)=0, which is the oppositeâ€”always tails. Also wrong.

Options D through J have different fractions, like 1/6 and 5/6, or 2/5 and 3/5, etc. These don't add up to 1, or they don't represent a fair coin. For example, option E's fractions add up to 5/5, which is 1, but the individual probabilities are 2/5 and 3/5, which don't match a fair coin's 50-50 split.

So, yes, option B is the correct probability distribution here. Both outcomes have equal probability, each being 1/2.

The probability distribution of X is f(0) = 1/2 and f(1) = 1/2, which corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
