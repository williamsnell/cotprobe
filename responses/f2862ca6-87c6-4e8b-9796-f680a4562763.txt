Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Cicero and his views on certain doctrines. The question is asking which doctrine he considered the most pernicious, meaning very harmful or destructive. The options are from A to J, each presenting a different idea.

First, I remember that Cicero was a Roman philosopher and statesman, and he had strong beliefs about morality and ethics. I think he was a Stoic, which means he valued virtue, self-control, and had a certain view on right and wrong.

The question is about what he found most pernicious. So I need to think about each option and see which one aligns with what I know about Cicero's philosophy.

Option A: It is sometimes necessary to act against one's principles. Hmm, I'm not sure. I think Stoics generally adhere to their principles, but maybe in extreme situations, they might bend? I'm not certain if this is the one he'd call pernicious.

Option B: It is sometimes permissible to lie. Cicero probably didn't like lying. I recall he wrote about honesty being important. So if lying is sometimes allowed, that might be against his views. But I'm not sure if this is the worst one.

Option C: Moral rightness is relative to one’s culture. Wait, Cicero believed in universal moral principles, right? So if morality is relative, that would go against his stance. This could be a pernicious idea because it undermines the idea of objective morality.

Option D: Morality is subjective and can be changed based on personal preferences. This seems similar to option C. If morality is just personal, then there's no objective standard. Cicero, being a Stoic, likely believed in objective morality, so this could be another strong candidate.

Option E: A thing may be expedient without being morally right. This seems to touch on the idea that just because something is practical or advantageous, it doesn't make it moral. Cicero probably agreed that expediency shouldn't override morality, so this might be pernicious if someone argues that expediency is acceptable regardless of morality.

Option F: Lying is always morally wrong. Wait, but the question is about what is pernicious. If lying is always wrong, that's a strong stance, but I'm not sure if that's the worst doctrine. Maybe not the answer.

Option G: One's actions do not have consequences. That seems like a dangerous belief because it could lead to reckless behavior. But I'm not sure if this was Cicero's main concern.

Option H: The gods do not care what we do. Cicero was a polytheist, I think, so he probably believed the gods had a role in moral matters. If the gods don't care, that might remove the basis for moral accountability, which could be pernicious.

Option I: There is no absolute truth. This is a big one. If there's no absolute truth, then moral principles could be subjective. Cicero likely believed in absolute truths, so this could be a very harmful idea.

Option J: The gods are indifferent to human affairs. Similar to H, this might remove the divine basis for morality. If the gods don't care, why follow moral rules? That could be pernicious.

Now, I need to figure out which of these aligns with what Cicero considered the most harmful. I think he was concerned about the foundations of morality. If there's no absolute truth (option I) or if the gods are indifferent (J), that could erode the basis for moral law. Alternatively, if moral rightness is relative (C) or subjective (D), that also attacks the objectivity of morality.

Wait, I remember that in "On the Republic," Cicero talks about the concept of the res publica, which includes the idea of a moral community. He also discusses the idea that the good is what is in accordance with nature, which implies an objective standard. So, any doctrine that undermines that objectivity would be pernicious.

Looking back, option C suggests that moral rightness is relative to culture. That goes against the idea of universal morality. Similarly, option D says morality is subjective and based on personal preferences, which also attacks objectivity.

Option E is about expediency vs. morality. Cicero might have considered the idea that expedience trumps morality as dangerous, but I'm not sure if that's the most pernicious. The most pernicious would be the one that undermines the very foundation of morality.

I think the answer is either C or D. Now, looking at the options again, the question is what he called "no more pernicious doctrine." I think in his work, he particularly criticized the idea that moral rightness is relative because it would lead to moral relativism, which he saw as destructive.

So, I'm leaning towards option C: moral rightness is relative to one’s culture.

Cicero, a Roman Stoic philosopher, strongly believed in universal moral principles and the objectivity of truth. Among the options provided, the doctrine that aligns most closely with what he would consider pernicious is the idea that moral rightness is relative to one’s culture. This directly contradicts his belief in objective morality and undermines the foundation of ethical standards, making it the most harmful doctrine in his view.
