Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about controlling industrial pollution by recovering waste products into usable forms. The reaction given is 2H₂S + SO₂ → 3S + 2H₂O. So, they're using hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide to produce elemental sulfur and water. The problem asks how much sulfur can be recovered if 650,000 kg of SO₂ are deposited into the air. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

Alright, first, I think I need to understand the reaction properly. Let me write it down again to visualize it better:

2 H₂S + SO₂ → 3 S + 2 H₂O

Hmm, so the reactants are H₂S and SO₂, and the products are S (elemental sulfur) and H₂O (water). So, the idea is that by reacting these two gases, we produce sulfur which can be recovered.

The question is about stoichiometry, I believe. It's about finding out how much of one substance reacts with another, based on the balanced equation. So, I need to use the mole ratios from the balanced equation to find out how much sulfur is produced when a certain amount of SO₂ is used.

Wait, but the problem states that 650,000 kg of SO₂ are deposited. So, that's the mass we're starting with. I think I need to find out how many moles of SO₂ that is, then use the mole ratio from the reaction to find out the moles of S produced, and then convert that into kilograms.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, find the molar mass of SO₂. Sulfur is about 32.07 g/mol, and oxygen is 16.00 g/mol. So, SO₂ would be 32.07 + 2*(16.00) = 32.07 + 32 = 64.07 g/mol.

Next, calculate the moles of SO₂ in 650,000 kg. Wait, 650,000 kg is 650,000,000 grams, right? Because 1 kg = 1000 grams. So, moles = mass / molar mass.

Moles of SO₂ = 650,000,000 g / 64.07 g/mol ≈ let's see. Let me compute that. 650,000,000 divided by 64.07. Hmm, 64.07 goes into 650,000,000 how many times? Let me approximate.

Well, 64.07 * 10,000,000 = 640,700,000. So, 650,000,000 is about 650,000,000 / 64.07 ≈ roughly 10,146,000 moles. Wait, let me do it more accurately.

Wait, maybe I should compute it using exact numbers. Let me compute 650,000,000 / 64.07.

64.07 × 10 million = 640.7 million grams, which is 640,700 kg. But wait, we have 650,000 kg, which is 650,000,000 grams. So, 650,000,000 / 64.07 ≈ let's calculate:

64.07 × 10,146,000 ≈ 64.07 * 10 million = 640.7 million, plus 64.07 * 146,000 = approx 64.07 * 100,000=6,407,000; 64.07 *46,000 ≈ 2,947,220. So total about 640.7M + 6,407,000 + 2,947,220 ≈ around 640,700,000 + 9,354,220 ≈ 650,054,220 grams. So, approximately 10,146,000 moles of SO₂.

Wait, but maybe I can just calculate it as 650,000,000 / 64.07. Let me compute that: 650,000,000 ÷ 64.07 ≈ let's see. 64.07 × 10,000,000 = 640,700,000. The difference between 650,000,000 and 640,700,000 is 9,300,000. So, 9,300,000 ÷ 64.07 ≈ about 145,200. So total moles ≈ 10,000,000 + 145,200 ≈ 10,145,200 moles. Let's say approximately 10,145,200 moles of SO₂.

Now, looking at the balanced equation: 2 H₂S + SO₂ → 3 S + 2 H₂O.

The mole ratio between SO₂ and S is 1:3. So, for every mole of SO₂, we get 3 moles of S.

So, moles of S produced = 3 × moles of SO₂ reacted. Assuming all SO₂ is consumed (since the problem says it's deposited, so I think we can assume it's all used in the reaction), then moles of S = 3 × 10,145,200 ≈ 30,435,600 moles of S.

Now, find the molar mass of S. Sulfur is about 32.07 g/mol. So, the mass of S produced is moles × molar mass = 30,435,600 mol × 32.07 g/mol.

Let me compute that. 30,435,600 × 32.07. Let's break it down: 30,435,600 × 30 = 913,068,000, and 30,435,600 × 2.07 = ?

Wait, 30,435,600 × 2 = 60,871,200.

30,435,600 × 0.07 = 2,130,492.

So, 60,871,200 + 2,130,492 = 62, 871,200 + 2,130,492 = 62, 871,200? Wait, no, 60,871,200 + 2,130,492 = 62, 871,200 + 2,130,492? Wait, 60,871,200 + 2,130,492 is 62, 871,200 + 2,130,492? Wait, 60,871,200 plus 2,130,492 equals 62, 871,200 + 2,130,492 equals 62, 871,200 + 2,130,492 equals approximately 63,001,692.

So, total mass = 913,068,000 (from 30) plus 63,001,692 (from 2.07) equals 976,069,692 grams. Wait, 913,068,000 + 63,001,692 is 976,069,692 grams.

Wait, that's 976,069,692 grams, which is 976,069.692 kg. So approximately 976,069.692 kg.

Looking at the options, option C is 979,000 kg. Hmm, that's pretty close. Let me check my calculations again to see if I made any mistakes.

Alternatively, maybe I should use exact molar masses and recalculate.

Let me recalculate the moles of SO₂ more accurately.

Molar mass of SO₂: S = 32.065 g/mol, O = 16.00 g/mol. So 32.065 + 2*16.00 = 32.065 + 32.00 = 64.065 g/mol.

So, 650,000 kg is 650,000,000 grams.

Moles of SO₂ = 650,000,000 g / 64.065 g/mol ≈ let's compute this.

64.065 × 10,000,000 = 640,650,000 grams. The difference between 650,000,000 and 640,650,000 is 9,350,000 grams.

So, 9,350,000 / 64.065 ≈ 9,350,000 ÷ 64.065 ≈ let's see, 64.065 × 145,000 ≈ 64.065 * 100,000 = 6,406,500; 64.065 *45,000≈ 2,882, 925. So, 6,406,500 + 2,882,925 = 9,289,425. That's close to 9,350,000. So, 145,000 gives us about 9,289,425, so the remaining is 9,350,000 -9,289,425=60,575 grams. So, 60,575 /64.065≈approx 945. So total moles ≈ 10,000,000 + 145,000 + 945 ≈ 10,145,945 moles.

Now, moles of S = 3 * 10,145,945 ≈30,437,835 moles.

Molar mass of S is 32.065 g/mol. So, mass of S = 30,437,835 mol * 32.065 g/mol.

Let me compute this:

30,437,835 × 32.065.

Breaking it down:

30,437,835 × 30 = 913,135,050.

30,437,835 × 2.065 = ?

First, 30,437,835 × 2 = 60,875,670.

30,437,835 × 0.065 = Let's compute 30,437,835 × 0.06 = 1,826,270.1, and 30,437,835 × 0.005 = 152,189.175. So total is 1,826,270.1 + 152,189.175 ≈1,978,459.275.

So, 60,875,670 + 1,978,459.275 ≈62,854,129.275 grams.

Adding to the 913,135,050 grams:

913,135,050 + 62,854,129.275 ≈975,989,179.275 grams, which is 975,989.179 kg.

Wait, that's about 975,989 kg, which is approximately 976,000 kg. Looking at the options, option C is 979,000 kg. That's pretty close. Hmm, perhaps I made a slight miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, maybe I should check the stoichiometry again. The balanced equation is 2 H₂S + SO₂ → 3 S + 2 H₂O. So, 1 mole of SO₂ produces 3 moles of S. So, the ratio is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use exact decimal places.

Wait, perhaps I can approach it using exact ratios without so many approximations.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the ratio directly without calculating moles.

Let me try another approach. The molar ratio of SO₂ to S is 1:3. So, for every 64.07 g of SO₂, we get 3 ×32.07 =96.21 g of S.

So, the mass ratio is 96.21 g S per 64.07 g SO₂.

So, the mass of S produced would be (96.21 /64.07) × mass of SO₂.

So, (96.21 /64.07) ≈ 1.5015.

So, 1.5015 × 650,000 kg = ?

1.5015 × 650,000 = 1.5 ×650,000 = 975,000, plus 0.0015 ×650,000=975. So total 975,000 + 975=975,975 kg. So approximately 975,975 kg.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C: 979,000 kg. Hmm, but wait, that's a bit higher than my 975,975.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the ratio.

Wait, 32.07 *3 is 96.21, correct. 64.07 is correct. So 96.21/64.07 is approximately 1.5015.

Wait, 96.21 ÷64.07: Let me compute that more accurately. 64.07 ×1.5 is 96.105. So 64.07 ×1.5015 =64.07 ×1.5 +64.07 ×0.0015=96.105 +0.096105≈96.201105 g.

So, 96.201105 g S per 64.07 g SO₂.

So, 650,000 kg SO₂ × (96.201105 g S / 64.07 g SO₂) = 650,000 kg × (96.201105 /64.07) ≈650,000 ×1.5015 ≈975,975 kg.

But the option C is 979,000, which is 3,025 kg higher. Hmm, maybe the molar masses are more precise.

Let me check the exact molar masses.

Sulfur: 32.065 g/mol.

Oxygen: 16.00 g/mol.

So, SO₂ is 32.065 + 2×16.00 =32.065 +32=64.065 g/mol.

S is 32.065 g/mol.

So, the ratio is (3 ×32.065) /64.065 = 96.195 /64.065 ≈1.5015.

So, 1.5015 ×650,000 =975,975 kg. So, why is option C 979,000 kg? Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the initial mole calculation.

Wait, 650,000,000 g SO₂ /64.065 g/mol = ?

Let me compute 650,000,000 ÷64.065.

64.065 ×10,000,000 =640,650,000.

650,000,000 -640,650,000 =9,350,000 grams.

Now, 9,350,000 ÷64.065 = let's compute.

64.065 × 145,000 = let's see: 64.065*100,000=6,406,500; 64.065*40,000=2,562,600; 64.065*5,000=320,325. So 6,406,500 +2,562,600=8,969,100 +320,325=9,289,425.

So, 64.065 ×145,000=9,289,425 grams.

We have 9,350,000 grams left, which is 9,350,000 -9,289,425=60,575 grams.

60,575 ÷64.065 ≈approx 945. So total moles SO₂ =10,000,000 +145,000 +945≈10,145,945 moles.

Moles of S=3×10,145,945=30,437,835 moles.

Mass of S=30,437,835 ×32.065=?

30,437,835 ×32=974,010,  30,437,835 ×0.065=1,978,  974,010,000 +1,978,  wait, perhaps I should compute it as:

30,437,835 ×32.065 =30,437,835 ×(32 +0.065)=30,437,835 ×32 +30,437,835 ×0.065.

30,437,835 ×32 = let's compute:

30,437,835 ×30=913,135,050.

30,437,835 ×2=60,875,670.

Total=913,135,050 +60,875,670=974,010,720.

Now, 30,437,835 ×0.065= let's compute.

0.065=65/1000=13/200.

So, 30,437,835 ×13= let's compute 30,437,835 ×10=304,378,350; ×3=91,313,505. So total 304,378,350 +91,313,505=395,691,855.

Now, divide by 200: 395,691,855 ÷200=1,978,459.275.

So, total mass of S is 974,010,720 +1,978,459.275=975,989,179.275 grams, which is 975,989.179 kg.

So, approximately 975,989 kg. The option C is 979,000 kg, which is about 3,000 kg more. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction produces 3 moles of S per mole of SO₂, so the ratio is 3:1 in moles, but in mass terms, it's (3 ×32.07)/(64.07) = (96.21)/(64.07)= approx 1.5015. So, 650,000 ×1.5015=975,975 kg.

But option C is 979,000 kg. Hmm, perhaps my initial calculation was slightly off due to rounding errors.

Wait, perhaps I can compute it more precisely.

Let me compute 96.21 /64.07 exactly.

96.21 ÷64.07 = ?

Let me compute 64.07 ×1.5 =96.105, which is just a bit less than 96.21. The difference is 96.21 -96.105=0.105.

So, 0.105 ÷64.07 ≈0.001639.

So, total multiplier is 1.5 +0.001639≈1.501639.

So, 1.501639 ×650,000 kg = ?

Compute 650,000 ×1.5 =975,000.

650,000 ×0.001639=1,064.35.

So, total is 975,000 +1,064.35=976,064.35 kg.

So, approximately 976,064 kg. So, 976,064 kg is about 976,064, which is very close to 976,069 kg from the earlier calculation.

Looking back at the options, none of them have 976,064. The closest is option C:979,000 kg. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the molar masses. Let me double-check.

Wait, the molar mass of SO₂ is 32.065 (S) + 2*16.00 (O) = 32.065 +32=64.065 g/mol.

Molar mass of S is 32.065 g/mol.

So, the ratio is (3*32.065)/64.065 =96.195/64.065≈1.5015.

Hmm, perhaps the options have rounded the numbers. So, 1.5015 ×650,000=975,975 kg. But none of the options match exactly. Wait, looking at the options again:

Options are:

A: 2,000,000 kg

B: 650,000 kg

C:979,000 kg

D:1,300,000 kg

E:1,950,000 kg

F:1,020,000 kg

G:1,500,000 kg

H:500,000 kg

I:800,000 kg

J:3,060,000 kg

Hmm, 975,975 is closest to option C:979,000 kg. But why is there a discrepancy? Maybe I made a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Wait, let me check the balanced equation again. The reaction is 2H₂S + SO₂ →3S + 2H₂O. So, for every 2 moles of H₂S and 1 mole of SO₂, we get 3 moles of S. So, the mole ratio of SO₂ to S is 1:3, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possibility that not all SO₂ is converted, but the problem states that the SO₂ is deposited into the air, so I think it's safe to assume it's all used.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the ratio in mass terms directly, without going through moles, but that's not correct. No, stoichiometry requires moles.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it using more precise decimal places.

Let me try calculating the exact value.

Mass of S = (650,000 kg SO₂) × (3 moles S /1 mole SO₂) × (32.065 g S / 64.065 g SO₂) × (1 kg /1000 g)

So,

=650,000 ×3 ×32.065 / (64.065 ×1000)

= (650,000 ×3 ×32.065) / (64.065 ×1000)

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= (650,000 / 1000) × (3 ×32.065 /64.065 )

= 650 × (96.195 /64.065 )

Now, 96.195 ÷64.065 ≈1.5015.

So, 650 ×1.5015=?

650 ×1.5=975.

650 ×0.0015=0.975.

So total is 975 +0.975=975.975 kg.

Wait, but that can't be right because 650 kg would give 975.975 kg of S, but we're dealing with 650,000 kg of SO₂. Wait, no, the calculation is correct. Wait, 650,000 kg SO₂ is 650,000 kg. So, the calculation becomes:

650,000 kg SO₂ × (3 ×32.065 g S) / (64.065 g SO₂ ×1000 g/kg )

Ah, wait, I think I made a mistake in the units. Let me re-express the calculation correctly.

Wait, 650,000 kg SO₂ × (3 moles S /1 mole SO₂) × (32.065 g S / 1 mole S) × (1 kg S /1000 g S) × (1 kg SO₂ /64.065 g SO₂).

Wait, that's a bit complicated, but let's write it as:

(650,000 kg SO₂) × (3 mol S /1 mol SO₂) × (32.065 g S /1 mol S) × (1 kg S /1000 g S) × (1 kg SO₂ /64.065 g SO₂).

Simplify:

=650,000 ×3 ×32.065 × (1/1000) × (1/64.065) kg S.

= (650,000 ×3 ×32.065) / (1000 ×64.065) kg.

Calculating numerator: 650,000 ×3=1,950,000; ×32.065=1,950,000 ×32.065.

Let me compute that: 1,950,000 ×32=62,400,000; 1,950,000 ×0.065=126,750. So total is 62,400,000 +126,750=62,526,750.

Denominator:1000 ×64.065=64,065.

So, 62,526,750 ÷64,065 ≈ 62,526,750 /64,065 ≈ let's compute.

64,065 ×975=?

Well, 64,065 ×900=57,658,500.

64,065 ×75=4,804,875.

So, 57,658,500 +4,804,875=62,463,375.

The difference between 62,526,750 and 62,463,375 is 63,375.

63,375 ÷64,065 ≈0.992.

So, total is approximately 975 +0.992=975.992.

So, 975.992 kg S.

Wait, but that can't be right because the input is 650,000 kg of SO₂, which is 650,000,000 grams, and we're getting 975,992 kg of S, which is 975,992,000 grams. Wait, that makes sense because the ratio is about 1.5 times, so 650,000 kg ×1.5=975,000 kg, which aligns with the calculation.

Wait, but earlier I thought I got 975,975 kg, but this method gives 975.992 kg for 650,000 kg of SO₂. Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused with the units.

Wait, no, the calculation is 650,000 kg SO₂ × (3×32.065)/(64.065×1000) = 650,000 × (96.195)/(64.065×1000) = 650,000 ×1.5015 =975,975 kg S.

So, I think the correct answer is approximately 975,975 kg, which rounds to 976,000 kg. But the option C is 979,000 kg. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the mass of S produced per kg of SO₂.

Since 64.065 g SO₂ produces 96.195 g S, then 1 kg SO₂ (1000 g) produces (96.195/64.065) ×1000 g S.

So, 96.195/64.065≈1.5015, so 1.5015 ×1000=1501.5 g S per kg SO₂.

So, for 650,000 kg SO₂, the S produced is 650,000 ×1501.5 g.

Wait, 650,000 kg ×1501.5 g/kg = 650,000 ×1.5015 kg/kg ×1000 g/kg.

Wait, no, perhaps better to compute 650,000 kg ×1501.5 g/kg = 650,000 ×1501.5 grams.

But that's 650,000 ×1501.5 = let's compute:

650,000 ×1500=975,000,000 grams.

650,000 ×1.5=975,000 grams.

So total is 975,000,000 +975,000 =975,975,000 grams, which is 975,975 kg.

So, again, 975,975 kg. So, the correct answer should be 975,975 kg, which is approximately 976,000 kg. But the options don't have that. The closest is option C:979,000 kg. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation mistake in the ratio. Let me compute 96.195 /64.065 precisely.

96.195 ÷64.065.

Let me compute this division step by step.

64.065 ×1.5 =96.0975.

So, 64.065 ×1.5015 =96.0975 + (64.065 ×0.0015)=96.0975 +0.0960975≈96.1935975.

Which is very close to 96.195. So, the multiplier is approximately 1.5015.

So, 650,000 ×1.5015=975,975 kg.

So, unless there's a mistake in the problem's options, I think the intended answer is option C:979,000 kg, perhaps due to rounding in the problem's numbers. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the molar mass of S is 32.07 g/mol, so 3×32.07=96.21 g, and SO₂ is 64.07 g/mol.

So, 96.21 /64.07≈1.5015.

So, 650,000 ×1.5015≈975,975 kg.

But option C is 979,000 kg, which is 3,025 kg higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the reaction produces 3 moles of S per mole of SO₂. Let me look again.

The balanced equation: 2 H₂S + SO₂ →3 S + 2 H₂O.

Yes, 1 mole of SO₂ gives 3 moles of S. So the ratio is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be rounded up to the nearest 1,000 kg. 975,975 rounds to 976,000, but option C is 979,000. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses different molar masses.

Wait, if I use S as 32 g/mol and SO₂ as 64 g/mol, then the ratio would be (3×32)/64=96/64=1.5. So, 1.5 ×650,000=975,000 kg.

Hmm, that's 975,000 kg, which is not among the options either. The closest option is C:979,000 kg.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be 650,000 ×3/2=975,000 kg. But that's not matching any option. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is 3/2.

Wait, in the balanced equation, the mole of SO₂ is 1, and S is 3. So, the ratio is 3:1.

Wait, but in mass terms, it's (3×32.07)/(64.07)=96.21/64.07≈1.5015.

So, perhaps the intended answer is option C:979,000 kg, but my calculation keeps getting 975,975 kg. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. Option C is 979,000 kg, which is 3,025 kg higher than my calculated 975,975 kg. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, let me try another approach using exact decimals.

Compute 650,000 × (96.21 /64.07).

96.21 ÷64.07 = let's compute it precisely.

64.07 ×1.5 =96.105.

The difference between 96.21 and 96.105 is 0.105.

So, 0.105 ÷64.07≈0.001639.

So, total multiplier is 1.501639.

Now, 650,000 ×1.501639= ?

Compute 650,000 ×1.5=975,000.

650,000 ×0.001639=1,064.35.

Total=975,000 +1,064.35=976,064.35 kg.

So, approximately 976,064 kg.

Still, the closest option is C:979,000 kg. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be 976,000 kg, but it's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction produces 3 moles of S, but in the problem, the sulfur is in liquid form, so perhaps there's a purity consideration or something else. But the problem states that sulfur is recovered as liquid, so I think that's accounted for.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't 100% efficient, but the problem doesn't mention efficiency, so I assume it's 100%.

Hmm, perhaps the options have a typo, or I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the molar mass of H₂S as well, but the problem only asks about the recovery of sulfur from SO₂, so H₂S's molar mass shouldn't affect the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is written incorrectly. Let me check the reaction again: 2H₂S + SO₂ →3S +2H₂O. Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the maximum possible sulfur recovery, so the answer is option C:979,000 kg, but I can't reconcile the calculation with that number. Alternatively, maybe I should select the closest option, which is C:979,000 kg.
</think>

To determine how much sulfur can be recovered when 650,000 kg of SO₂ is deposited, we analyze the reaction:

**Reaction:**  
\[ 2H_2S + SO_2 \rightarrow 3S + 2H_2O \]

### Step 1: Molar Masses  
- Molar mass of \( SO_2 \):  
  \[ S = 32.07 \, \text{g/mol}, \, O = 16.00 \, \text{g/mol} \]  
  \[ SO_2 = 32.07 + 2(16.00) = 64.07 \, \text{g/mol} \]

- Molar mass of \( S \):  
  \[ S = 32.07 \, \text{g/mol} \]

### Step 2: Moles of \( SO_2 \)  
Given \( 650,000 \, \text{kg} = 650,000,000 \, \text{g} \):  
\[
\text{Moles of } SO_2 = \frac{650,000,000 \, \text{g}}{64.07 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 10,145,200 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 3: Mole Ratio  
From the balanced equation, \( 1 \, \text{mol of } SO_2 \) produces \( 3 \, \text{mol of } S \):  
\[
\text{Moles of } S = 3 \times 10,145,200 \approx 30,435,600 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 4: Mass of Sulfur  
\[
\text{Mass of } S = \text{Moles of } S \times \text{Molar mass of } S
\]  
\[
\text{Mass of } S = 30,435,600 \, \text{mol} \times 32.07 \, \text{g/mol} \approx 975,975,000 \, \text{g} = 975,975 \, \text{kg}
\]

### Step 5: Closest Option  
The calculated mass of sulfur is approximately \( 975,975 \, \text{kg} \). Among the given options, the closest value is **C: 979,000 kg**.
