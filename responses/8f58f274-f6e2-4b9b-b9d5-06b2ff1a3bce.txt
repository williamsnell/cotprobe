Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here about a magnesium strip reacting with hydrochloric acid. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, the question says a 15g strip of magnesium is placed in dilute HCl. I need to calculate the work done by the system. The conditions are atmospheric pressure 1.0 atm and temperature 25°C, which is 298.15 K, I think. The options are from A to J, with some negative and positive values.

Hmm, work done by the system... I remember that in thermodynamics, work is usually associated with expansion work, like when gases expand against an external pressure. The formula I recall is w = -P_ext * ΔV, where P is pressure and ΔV is the change in volume.

But wait, the reaction here is between magnesium metal and hydrochloric acid. The reaction should produce hydrogen gas, right? The reaction equation should be Mg(s) + 2HCl(aq) → MgCl2(aq) + H2(g). So magnesium reacts with hydrochloric acid to produce magnesium chloride, water, and hydrogen gas.

Since hydrogen gas is produced, the volume of the system increases because H2 is a gas. So the system (the reaction) is doing work on the surroundings by expanding, pushing against the atmospheric pressure.

So I need to find the volume of H2 gas produced and then calculate the work done using w = -PΔV. But wait, wait. The formula has a negative sign because work done by the system is considered negative in the sign convention (I think).

Wait, let me get this straight. If the system expands, it's doing work on the surroundings, so the work should be negative. So in the formula, if ΔV is positive (volume increases), then w = -P_ext * ΔV would be negative, which matches the convention.

But first, I need to find out how much hydrogen gas is produced. The mass of Mg is 15g. Molar mass of Mg is about 24.305 g/mol, right? So moles of Mg = 15g / 24.305 g/mol ≈ 0.617 moles.

From the reaction equation, 1 mole of Mg produces 1 mole of H2. So moles of H2 should be the same as Mg, about 0.617 mol.

Now, at 25°C and 1 atm, I can use the ideal gas law to find the volume of H2 produced. PV = nRT. Let's plug in the numbers:

P = 1 atm
n = 0.617 mol
R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K)
T = 298.15 K

So V = (nRT)/P = (0.617 * 0.0821 * 298.15) / 1

Let me calculate that:

0.617 * 0.0821 ≈ 0.0507
0.0507 * 298.15 ≈ 15.13 liters.

Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 0.617 * 0.0821 = let me compute it more accurately.

0.617 * 0.0821: 0.6 * 0.0821 = 0.04926, 0.017 * 0.0821 ≈ 0.0013957. So total ≈ 0.0506557.

Multiply by 298.15: 0.0506557 * 298 ≈ 15.09 liters. So around 15.1 liters.

So the volume change ΔV is approximately 15.1 L. But wait, what's the initial volume? Before the reaction, the volume is just the volume of the solution in the beaker, but since the magnesium is a solid and HCl is aqueous, the initial volume of gas is probably negligible. So the change in volume is approximately equal to the volume of H2 produced, 15.1 L.

So the work done by the system (the reaction) is w = -P_ext * ΔV. Here, P is 1 atm, and ΔV is 15.1 L. But wait, what's the unit? Since P is in atm and V is in liters, then work will be in L·atm. I remember that 1 L·atm is approximately 101.325 J. But wait, the question asks for work in kJ, so I need to convert.

So first compute the work in L·atm: w = -1 atm * 15.1 L = -15.1 L·atm.

Convert to joules: 15.1 L·atm * 101.325 J/(L·atm) ≈ 1529.8 J, which is about 1.5298 kJ. But since work is negative, it's -1.53 kJ approximately.

Looking at the options, option A is -1.5 kJ. But wait, I think I made a mistake because the reaction produces 0.617 mol of H2, but maybe I should check if the stoichiometry is correct.

Wait, the balanced equation is Mg + 2HCl → MgCl2 + H2. So yes, 1 mole Mg gives 1 mole H2. So 0.617 mol Mg gives 0.617 mol H2. So the volume calculation seems correct.

Wait another thing: the reaction produces H2 gas, which is expanding against atmospheric pressure, so the work done by the system is indeed negative. So the calculation I did should be correct, around -1.5 kJ, which is option A.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is -1.5 kJ, which matches my calculation. However, let me make sure I didn't miss anything else.

Wait, another thought: when the system expands, the work done by the system is negative. So that's correct. Also, the volume of the gas is 15.1 L, but wait, when the reaction starts, the beaker probably has some volume, but the expansion is the increase in gas volume. So yes, ΔV is about 15.1 L.

Wait, but wait: the reaction produces H2 gas, which is a product. So the change in volume is from the gas produced. So I think my approach is correct.

Alternatively, maybe another approach can be used. The work done is P_ext multiplied by the change in volume. So if the system's volume increases by 15.1 L, then the work is P * ΔV, but with a negative sign because the system is doing work.

So, yes, -15.1 L·atm, which is about -1.5 kJ.

Looking back at the options, option A is -1.5 kJ. So that should be the answer.

The reaction between magnesium and hydrochloric acid produces hydrogen gas, which expands against atmospheric pressure, causing the system to do work. The work done is calculated using the formula \( w = -P_{\text{ext}} \Delta V \), where \( P_{\text{ext}} = 1 \, \text{atm} \) and \( \Delta V \) is the volume of hydrogen gas produced.

The mass of magnesium is \( 15 \, \text{g} \), and its molar mass is \( 24.305 \, \text{g/mol} \), giving \( 0.617 \, \text{mol} \) of Mg. From the balanced equation \( \text{Mg} + 2\text{HCl} \rightarrow \text{MgCl}_2 + \text{H}_2 \), 1 mole of Mg produces 1 mole of \( \text{H}_2 \), so \( 0.617 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{H}_2 \) is produced.

Using the ideal gas law \( PV = nRT \), the volume of \( \text{H}_2 \) at \( 25^\circ \text{C} \) and \( 1 \, \text{atm} \) is:

\[
V = \frac{nRT}{P} = \frac{0.617 \cdot 0.0821 \cdot 298.15}{1} \approx 15.1 \, \text{L}.
\]

The work done is:

\[
w = -P_{\text{ext}} \Delta V = -1 \, \text{atm} \cdot 15.1 \, \text{L} = -15.1 \, \text{L·atm}.
\]

Converting to joules (\( 1 \, \text{L·atm} \approx 101.325 \, \text{J} \)):

\[
w = -15.1 \cdot 101.325 \approx -1.53 \, \text{kJ}.
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, the work done is \( -1.5 \, \text{kJ} \), which corresponds to option A.
