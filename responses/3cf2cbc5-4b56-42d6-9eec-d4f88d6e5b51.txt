Okay, so I need to figure out the major risk group for HIV infection among Latinos. I'm not an expert, but I'll try to think through this step by step. Let's see, the options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that HIV can be transmitted through different means, such as unprotected sex, sharing needles, and mother-to-child transmission. So the risk groups would depend on which of these factors are more prevalent in certain populations.

Looking at the options:

A: Healthcare workers. I think healthcare workers are at risk if they're exposed to blood or bodily fluids, but I'm not sure if this is the major group for Latinos. Maybe, but I think other factors might be more significant.

B: Pregnant women. While pregnancy can lead to mother-to-child transmission, I don't think pregnant women as a group are the major risk group. It's more about the transmission during pregnancy rather than the women themselves being high-risk unless other factors are involved.

C: Injection drug users. I know that sharing needles is a major risk factor for HIV. In many populations, including Latinos, injection drug use can contribute significantly to the spread of HIV. So this might be a strong candidate.

D: Heterosexual males. Heterosexual contact is a common way HIV is transmitted globally, but I'm not sure if it's the major group for Latinos. Maybe, but I think other factors might be more prominent.

E: Elderly individuals. HIV is most commonly diagnosed in younger people, so elderly individuals are probably not the major risk group.

F: Individuals with no sexual activity. If someone isn't sexually active, their risk is very low, so this group isn't a major risk.

G: Vegetarians. Diet doesn't directly cause HIV transmission, so this seems irrelevant.

H: Females. While women are at risk, I think the risk is more pronounced in certain groups within females, like those who are injection drug users or have multiple sexual partners.

I: Children under 12. Most HIV transmission in children is through mother-to-child, but it's not a major risk group in terms of overall transmission rates.

J: Homosexual males. I know that in many populations, including the US, men who have sex with men (MSM) are a high-risk group for HIV. However, I'm not sure if this is the case for Latinos specifically. I think it might vary by region, but I'm not certain.

Now, considering the Latino population, I think that in some regions, especially where there's a significant presence of injection drug use, that might contribute more to HIV cases. For example, in Puerto Rico or certain parts of the US where Latinos are a large population, injection drug use could be a major factor. 

Also, I recall that in some studies, the highest rates of HIV among Latinos in the US are actually among gay and bisexual men. So J might be the answer. But I'm a bit confused because I thought injection drug users were a major group too.

Wait, maybe I should think about which is more prevalent among Latinos. In the US, for example, among Latinos, it's reported that a significant number of HIV cases are among men who have sex with men. But I'm not sure if that's the case globally for all Latinos or just in specific regions.

Alternatively, in some Latin American countries, the main risk might be through heterosexual transmission, but perhaps in the US context, it's more among MSM.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. I think the major risk group for Latinos in the US is actually men who have sex with men, so J. But I'm not entirely sure because I'm conflating data from different regions.

Wait, another angle: the question is about the major risk group, which would be the group with the highest incidence. So if among Latinos, the highest number of new HIV infections comes from injection drug users, then C would be correct. But if it's from MSM, then J.

I think in the US, particularly, MSM is a major risk group for Latinos. But globally, maybe it's different. Since the question doesn't specify, I'm not sure. But I think the most common answer would be J, Homosexual males, as they are a major risk group in many populations.

Wait, but I'm not 100% certain. Maybe I should double-check. I remember reading that in the US, while MSM is a high-risk group, injection drug use is also a significant factor for Latinos. So perhaps C is the answer.

Wait, another thought: In many Latin American countries, the main route of transmission is through heterosexual sex, but for the Latino population in the US, the main risk factors might be different.

I think I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for some statistics. But since I can't do that right now, I have to go with my best guess.

Given that, I think the major risk group among Latinos is injection drug users, so C. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, it could be J, Homosexual males.

Wait, perhaps the answer is C because in some Latino communities, especially in areas with higher injection drug use, that's a bigger factor. But I'm not certain.

The major risk group for HIV infection among Latinos is **C: Injection drug users**. This is because the use of injection drugs and the practice of sharing needles are significant contributors to the spread of HIV, particularly in certain Latino populations where this behavior is prevalent.

Answer: C
