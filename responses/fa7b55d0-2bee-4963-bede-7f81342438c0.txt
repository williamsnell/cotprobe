Question:

Which of the following is true about dietary calcium:


Options:

A: Typical calcium intake in most adults is between 0.5mg and 2.0mg per day
B: Activated Vitamin D decreases absorption of dietary calcium
C: There is clear evidence that people who consume more than the average amount of calcium have a lower risk of bone fractures.
D: Absorption efficiency is inversely related to calcium intake, so that a higher proportion is absorbed when calcium intake is low

Answer:

Alright, so I have this multiple-choice question about dietary calcium, and I need to figure out which option is correct. Let's go through each option one by one.

The question is asking which statement is true about dietary calcium. The options are A to D.

Starting with option A: "Typical calcium intake in most adults is between 0.5mg and 2.0mg per day." Hmm, that seems low. I remember that the recommended daily intake for adults is around 1000-1200 mg, so 0.5-2 mg sounds way too low. Maybe A is incorrect.

Next, option B: "Activated Vitamin D decreases absorption of dietary calcium." Wait, I thought vitamin D is actually required for the absorption of calcium. Activated vitamin D (like calcitriol) helps the intestines absorb calcium. So if B says it decreases absorption, that must be wrong.

Option C: "There is clear evidence that people who consume more than the average amount of calcium have a lower risk of bone fractures." From what I've read, higher calcium intake, especially when combined with enough vitamin D, does support bone health and reduce fracture risk. But I'm not sure if the evidence is "clear" or if there are debates. Some studies might show mixed results, but generally, higher calcium is linked to lower fractures. So C might be correct, but I'm not certain.

Option D: "Absorption efficiency is inversely related to calcium intake, so that a higher proportion is absorbed when calcium intake is low." I remember something about calcium absorption efficiency. When you take in less calcium, your body absorbs a higher percentage of it. For example, if someone is getting 500 mg a day, they might absorb 40%, but if they take in 1000 mg, they might only absorb 30%. So as intake increases, the percentage absorbed decreases. That makes sense. So D is talking about inverse relation, which aligns with what I know. So D sounds correct.

Wait, but I thought both C and D could be correct. Let me think again. The question asks which is true. So maybe both C and D are correct? But looking at the options, I think only one is correct.

Wait, no, the options are A to D, so I have to choose the correct one. Let's reevaluate.

Option A: 0.5-2 mg is way too low. Adults need around 1000-1200 mg, so A is wrong.

Option B: Activated vitamin D decreases absorption? No, it's the opposite, so B is wrong.

Option C: Clear evidence that higher calcium reduces fractures. I think the evidence is strong, but maybe not perfectly clear? Or perhaps some studies show no effect, but overall, higher calcium is beneficial. So C might be correct.

Option D: Inverse relation between intake and absorption efficiency. Yes, that's correct. So both C and D seem correct, but wait, the question is which is true, so maybe only one is correct.

Wait, let me check again. The question is about dietary calcium. So for option C, the statement says "lower risk of bone fractures." I think that higher calcium intake does contribute to lower fracture risk, especially in older adults and postmenopausal women, but maybe the evidence isn't entirely clear. Some studies might show mixed results, but I'm leaning towards C being correct.

But wait, another angle: the absorption part in D. The body's ability to absorb calcium is inversely related to intake. So when you take in more calcium at once, your body absorbs a smaller percentage. But if you spread intake throughout the day, you can absorb more efficiently. So the statement in D is correct because higher intake (in a single dose) leads to lower absorption efficiency. So D is a true statement.

Now I'm confused because both C and D seem correct. Wait, let me read the options again.

Option C says "people who consume more than the average amount have a lower risk." The average intake is much lower than the recommended amount, so people above average (like meeting the RDA) would have lower fracture risk. That seems correct.

Option D is about absorption efficiency, which I know is true. So both C and D are correct statements, but the options are only from A to D, and I have to pick one. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me think about the exact wording of the options.

Option C: "There is clear evidence that people who consume more than the average amount of calcium have a lower risk of bone fractures." If the average intake is low (like around 500 mg), then people who consume more (like 1000 mg) would have lower risk. But I'm not sure if the evidence is "clear." Some studies might suggest that while calcium is important, too much might not be beneficial, but generally, higher intake is better for bone health.

Option D: "Absorption efficiency is inversely related to calcium intake, so that a higher proportion is absorbed when calcium intake is low." Yes, that's correct because the gut can only absorb a certain amount at once. So D is definitely correct.

Wait, but the question is which is true. If both C and D are correct, but the options are separate, then maybe only one is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mistaken about C.

Wait, another thought: the US dietary guidelines state that most people don't meet the calcium RDA, so the average intake is lower than 1000 mg. So people who consume more than average (like 1000-1200 mg) would have lower fracture risk. So C is correct.

But I'm not sure if the evidence is "clear" or if there's debate. For example, some studies suggest that high calcium intake might not protect against fractures unless combined with vitamin D, or that it's more about adequate intake rather than very high. So maybe the evidence isn't as clear as C states.

In that case, D is definitely correct. Because the absorption efficiency does decrease with higher intake. So I think D is correct.
