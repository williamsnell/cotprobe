Okay, so I need to figure out this bank question. Let me start by reading the problem carefully. Mr. Jones is the president of the First National Bank of St. Louis. He wants to know if the bank is holding too much of its demand deposits as reserves. The given data is: total deposits are $1,700,000, the reserve ratio is 20%, and the reserves are $850,000. We need to find the excess reserves.

Hmm, I remember that the reserve ratio is the percentage of deposits that the bank must hold as reserves. So the required reserves would be calculated by multiplying the total deposits by the reserve ratio. Let me do that: 20% of $1,700,000. 

20% is the same as 0.20, so 0.20 * 1,700,000 equals... let me calculate. 1,700,000 * 0.2 is 340,000. So the required reserves are $340,000.

But the bank actually has $850,000 in reserves. Excess reserves are the amount that the bank holds beyond the required reserves. So to find that, I subtract the required reserves from the actual reserves. That would be $850,000 minus $340,000.

Let me do the subtraction: 850,000 - 340,000 equals 510,000. So the excess reserves are $510,000.

Looking at the options, F is $510,000. So I think that's the right answer. But wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Total deposits: 1,700,000. Reserve ratio: 20%. Required reserves: 1,700,000 * 0.2 = 340,000. Reserves held: 850,000. Excess = 850,000 - 340,000 = 510,000. Yep, that seems correct. So the answer should be F.

The bank's required reserves are calculated as 20% of $1,700,000, which is $340,000. The actual reserves are $850,000, so the excess reserves are $850,000 - $340,000 = $510,000. 

Answer: F
