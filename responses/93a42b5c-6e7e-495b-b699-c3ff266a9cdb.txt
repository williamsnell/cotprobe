Question:

Suppose a monopoly market has a demand function in which quantity demanded depends not only on market price (P) but also on the amount of advertising the firm does (A, measured in dollars). The specific form of this function is Q = (20 - P)(1 + 0.1A - 0.01A^2). The monopolistic firm's cost function is given by C = 10Q + 15 + A. Suppose there is no advertising (A = 0). What output will the profit-maximizing firm choose?

Options:

A: 20
B: 0
C: 12
D: 5
E: 8
F: 30
G: 15
H: 10
I: 18
J: 25

Okay, so I've got this economics problem here about a monopoly market. Hmm, I need to find the output the firm will choose when there's no advertising. Let me think through this.

Alright, the demand function is given as Q = (20 - P)(1 + 0.1A - 0.01A²). And in this case, A is zero because there's no advertising. So the demand function simplifies. Wait, let me plug in A=0. That would make the term (1+0.1*0 -0.01*0²) equal to 1. So Q becomes (20 - P)*1, which is just 20 - P. So the demand equation is Q = 20 - P. That's a straight line, so it's a linear demand curve.

The cost function is C = 10Q + 15 + A. Again, since A is zero, that simplifies to C = 10Q +15. So the total cost is linear in Q.

Now, the firm's goal is to maximize profit, which is total revenue minus total cost. So first, I need to express total revenue in terms of Q. Since Q = 20 - P, I can solve for P: P = 20 - Q. Then, total revenue (TR) is P*Q, so TR = (20 - Q)*Q = 20Q - Q².

Total cost is C = 10Q +15. So profit (π) is TR - TC, which is (20Q - Q²) - (10Q +15) = 20Q - Q² -10Q -15 = 10Q - Q² -15.

Wait, no—wait, that's not right. Let me redo that. TR is 20Q - Q². TC is 10Q +15. So π = (20Q - Q²) - (10Q +15) = 20Q - Q² -10Q -15 = 10Q - Q² -15. 

To maximize profit, I need to find the derivative of π with respect to Q and set it to zero. So dπ/dQ = 10 - 2Q. Setting that equal to zero: 10 - 2Q = 0 → 2Q=10 → Q=5.

Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the TR calculation. Oh wait, because I'm taking dπ/dQ, which is 10 - 2Q. Setting that equal to zero gives Q=5. So the firm's profit-maximizing output is 5 units. Looking at the options, option D is 5. So the answer should be D.

Another way to think about it: when A=0, the demand is linear, so the firm's revenue is P*Q = (20 - Q) * Q = 20Q - Q². The cost is 10Q +15. So the profit is 20Q - Q² -10Q -15 = 10Q - Q² -15. Taking the derivative gives 10-2Q, setting to zero gives Q=5. Yep, that's D.

The demand function simplifies to Q = 20 - P when A = 0, yielding a linear demand curve. The total revenue (TR) is calculated as P * Q = (20 - Q) * Q = 20Q - Q². The total cost (TC) is given by C = 10Q + 15. Profit (π) is TR - TC, which becomes π = (20Q - Q²) - (10Q + 15) = 10Q - Q² - 15. To maximize profit, take the derivative of π with respect to Q: dπ/dQ = 10 - 2Q. Setting this equal to zero gives Q = 5. Thus, the profit-maximizing output is 5 units.

Answer: D
