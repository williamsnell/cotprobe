Okay, so I've got this problem about an airplane wing, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. Let's see what the question is asking.

Part (a) says: The wings have a total plan area of 320 ft². The plane weighs 18,000 lbf, and it's flying at 230 ft/sec with atmospheric density at 0.076 lbm/ft³. The tailplane contributes 5% of the total lift force. I need to find the lift coefficient of the wings.

Hmm, lift coefficient. Right, the lift force equation is L = 0.5 * ρ * v² * S * Cl, where Cl is the lift coefficient, ρ is air density, v is velocity, and S is the wing area.

But wait, the tail contributes 5% of the lift. So the total lift should support the weight, which is 18,000 lbf. So total lift = 18,000 lbf.

Let me break it down. Let's say the lift from the wings is L_wings and from the tail is L_tail.

Given that L_tail is 5% of total lift, so L_tail = 0.05 * 18,000 = 900 lbf.

Therefore, L_wings = 18,000 - 900 = 17,100 lbf.

Now, using the lift equation for the wings: L_wings = 0.5 * ρ * v² * S * Cl_wings.

Plugging in the numbers:

Cl_wings = L_wings / (0.5 * ρ * v² * S)

Given:
L_wings = 17,100 lbf
ρ = 0.076 lbm/ft³
v = 230 ft/s
S = 320 ft²

Wait, but wait, units. The standard lift equation uses weight density (lb/ft³) but here ρ is given in lbm/ft³. Oh, right, so I need to convert that to slug/ft³ because the formula uses slugs in the English system.

Density in slugs is ρ = mass density / 32.174 lbm to slugs. So ρ = 0.076 / 32.174 ≈ 0.002362 slugs/ft³.

So, Cl_wings = 17,100 / (0.5 * 0.002362 * (230)^2 * 320)

Let me compute step by step.

First, compute 0.5 * 0.002362 = 0.001181.

Next, v squared: 230^2 = 52,900.

Multiply by 0.001181: 52,900 * 0.001181 ≈ 62.31.

Then multiply by S (320): 62.31 * 320 ≈ 19,939.2.

So denominator is approximately 19,939.2.

Now, Cl_wings = 17,100 / 19,939.2 ≈ 0.858, which is about 0.86. But I need to look at the options.

Wait, the options are A to J, and the Cl for part (a) is the first number in each pair.

Looking at the options, let's see:

A: 0.85

B: 0.80

C: 0.95

D: 0.70

E: 0.78

F: 1.00

G: 0.90

H: 0.75

I: 0.60

J: 0.65

Hmm, my calculation got ~0.86, but the closest option is A: 0.85. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Let me double-check the steps.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the denominator.

Compute denominator:

0.5 * ρ (slug) * v² * S.

ρ in slugs: 0.076 lbm/ft³ * (1 slug / 32.174 lbm) = 0.076 /32.174 ≈ 0.002362 slugs/ft³.

v² = 230^2 = 52,900 ft²/s².

So 0.5 * 0.002362 = 0.001181.

Multiply by v²: 0.001181 * 52,900 = let's compute:

0.001181 * 50,000 = 59.05

0.001181 * 2,900 ≈ 3.4249

Total ≈ 59.05 + 3.4249 ≈ 62.4749.

Then multiply by S = 320: 62.4749 *320 ≈ let's compute:

60 *320=19,200

2.4749*320≈791.968

Total ≈19,200 +791.968=19,991.968.

So denominator is ~19,992.

Cl_wings=17,100 /19,992≈0.855, which is about 0.855. So approximately 0.85, which matches option A.

Wait, but another way: some textbooks use the formula with weight density (lb/ft³) but that's when using slugs and ft-lbf. Let me think, perhaps I should check the formula again.

Wait, the standard lift equation is:

L = (1/2) * ρ_air * v² * S * Cl

But ρ_air here is in lbm/ft³, so to use it, we need to convert to slugs.

Alternatively, another approach: sometimes the formula is expressed as:

L = (1/2) * ρ [lbm/ft³] * v² [ft²/s²] * S [ft²] * Cl * (32.174 lbm/slug)

Wait, because 1 slug = 32.174 lbm, so maybe we can adjust the equation.

Wait, let me re-express the formula correctly. The standard equation in English units is:

L = (1/2) * ρ (lbm/ft³) * v² (ft²/s²) * S (ft²) * Cl * (32.174 lbm/slug)^(-1) * (lbf·s²/lbm·ft) )

Wait, perhaps that's complicating it. Maybe I should think in terms of force.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute the dynamic pressure and then find the lift coefficient.

Dynamic pressure q is (1/2) * ρ * v². But since ρ is in lbm/ft³, dynamic pressure will have units of lbm/(ft·s²). To get it into pounds-force per square foot, we need to divide by 32.174 lbm/slug, because 1 slug = 32.174 lbm, and F=ma in slugs.

So q in psf (pounds per square foot) is q = (0.5 * ρ * v²) / 32.174.

So let's compute that.

ρ = 0.076 lbm/ft³

v = 230 ft/s

q = 0.5 * 0.076 * (230)^2 / 32.174

Compute 230^2 = 52,900.

q = 0.5 * 0.076 * 52900 / 32.174

Calculate numerator: 0.5 * 0.076 = 0.038. Then 0.038 *52,900 ≈ 1,990.2.

Divide by 32.174: 1,990.2 /32.174 ≈ 61.843 lb/ft².

So q ≈61.843 psf.

Now, the lift force on the wing is L_wings = q * S * Cl.

We have L_wings = 17,100 lbf.

So 17,100 = 61.843 * 320 * Cl.

Compute 61.843 * 320 = let's see:

60 * 320 = 19,200

1.843 *320 ≈589.76

Total ≈19,200 +589.76 =19,789.76.

So 17,100 =19,789.76 * Cl.

Cl =17,100 /19,789.76 ≈0.862.

So about 0.862, which again is approximately 0.85, matching option A.

So part (a) answer is 0.85.

Now part (b): Drag coefficient of the wings is 0.055. Total drag is 1.75 times that caused by the wings alone. Find the forward thrust required.

Hmm, drag force equation is D = 0.5 * ρ * v² * S * Cd. But here, the total drag is 1.75 times the drag from the wings alone. So total drag D_total = 1.75 * D_wings.

But wait, the problem says "the total drag is 1.75 times that caused by the wings alone." So D_total = 1.75 * D_wings.

But the wings alone contribute D_wings = 0.5 * ρ * v² * S * Cd.

So D_total = 1.75 * (0.5 * ρ * v² * S * Cd).

We can compute D_total using this.

Wait, but the wings have a Cd of 0.055. So Cd_wings =0.055.

So D_total = 1.75 * (0.5 * ρ * v² * S * Cd_wings).

Compute that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the drag force from the wings and then multiply by 1.75 to get total drag.

Alternatively, I think the total drag is 1.75 times the wings' drag, so D_total = 1.75 * D_wings.

So D_wings = 0.5 * ρ * v² * S * Cd_wings.

So let's compute D_wings first.

ρ is 0.076 lbm/ft³, which as before, but when computing drag force in lbf, we might need to adjust units.

Wait, let's compute dynamic pressure again, which we did earlier as q =61.843 psf.

So D_wings = q * S * Cd_wings.

q is 61.843 psf, S=320 ft², Cd=0.055.

So D_wings =61.843 *320 *0.055.

Compute that:

61.843 *320 =19,789.76.

Multiply by 0.055: 19,789.76 *0.055 ≈1,088.4368 lbf.

Then D_total =1.75 *1,088.4368 ≈1,904.503 lbf.

So the total drag is approximately 1,904.5 lbf.

Wait, but the question is asking for the forward thrust required. Thrust needed to overcome drag. So thrust T equals drag D.

So T = D_total ≈1,904.5 lbf.

Now, looking at the options, part (b) is the second number in each option.

Looking at the options:

A: 0.85, 1937 lbf

B: 0.80, 1987 lbf

C: 0.95, 1837 lbf

D: 0.70, 2087 lbf

E: 0.78, 2032 lbf

F: 1.00, 1787 lbf

G: 0.90, 1887 lbf

H: 0.75, 2037 lbf

I: 0.60, 2187 lbf

J: 0.65, 2137 lbf

So I calculated thrust as ~1,904.5 lbf. The closest option is A:1937, which is 1937. So that's about 33 lbf higher. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate more accurately.

Let me recompute D_wings:

q =61.843 psf.

S =320 ft².

Cd_wings=0.055.

D_wings =61.843 *320 *0.055.

Compute 61.843 *320 = let me do it step by step.

61.843 *300 =18,552.9

61.843 *20 =1,236.86

Total =18,552.9 +1,236.86 =19,789.76.

Now multiply by 0.055:

19,789.76 *0.055.

Compute 19,789.76 *0.05 =989.488

19,789.76 *0.005=98.9488

Total =989.488 +98.9488 =1,088.4368 lbf.

So D_wings=1,088.4368 lbf.

D_total=1.75 *1,088.4368 ≈1,904.503 lbf.

Hmm, so 1,904.5 lbf.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A:1937, which is 32.5 lbf off. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, maybe I should recompute the dynamic pressure more accurately.

Let me compute q again:

q = 0.5 * ρ * v² / 32.174.

ρ =0.076 lbm/ft³.

v=230 ft/s.

So 0.5 *0.076 =0.038.

v²=230^2=52,900.

So 0.038 *52,900 = let me compute:

0.038 *50,000=1,900.

0.038 *2,900=108.2.

Total=1,900 +108.2=2,008.2.

Now divide by 32.174:

2,008.2 /32.174 ≈62.43 lb/ft².

Wait, earlier I had 61.843, but more accurately, it's 62.43.

So q=62.43 psf.

Now, D_wings =62.43 *320 *0.055.

Compute 62.43 *320 = let's see:

60*320=19,200.

2.43*320=777.6.

Total=19,200 +777.6=19,977.6.

Now multiply by 0.055:

19,977.6 *0.055.

Compute 19,977.6 *0.05=998.88.

19,977.6 *0.005=99.888.

Total=998.88 +99.888=1,098.768 lbf.

Then D_total=1.75 *1,098.768 ≈1,918.34 lbf.

Now, that's closer to 1,918 lbf. Looking at the options, option A is 1937, which is ~19 lbf higher.

Hmm, perhaps I need to check if I'm using the correct calculation for the total drag.

Wait, another approach: the total drag is 1.75 times that of the wings. So if the wings have Cd=0.055, and the other parts (fuselage, etc.) contribute the remaining.

But the problem says to ignore interference between wings and fuselage, but any other components would contribute to the total drag. So the total drag is 1.75 times the wings' drag. So my previous approach is correct.

Wait, maybe the lift coefficient affects the drag? Probably not, because part (b) is separate and only gives Cd for the wings. So the total drag is 1.75 times the wings' drag.

Wait, but maybe I should compute the wings' drag using the correct dynamic pressure.

Wait, let me check the dynamic pressure again:

q = (0.5 * ρ * v²) / 32.174.

ρ=0.076 lbm/ft³.

v=230 ft/s.

So 0.5 *0.076 =0.038.

v²=52,900.

So 0.038 *52,900 =2,008.2.

Divide by 32.174: 2,008.2 /32.174 ≈62.43 psf.

Yes, correct.

So D_wings =62.43 *320 *0.055.

Compute 62.43 *320 =19,977.6.

19,977.6 *0.055=1,098.768 lbf.

D_total=1.75 *1,098.768≈1,918.34 lbf.

So the required thrust is approximately 1,918 lbf. The options don't have this exactly. The closest is option A:1937 lbf, which is about 19 lbf higher. Alternatively, perhaps I should check if part (a) affects part (b). Wait, no, part (b) is at the same flight condition, so the same speed and density, so same dynamic pressure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using the total wing area including tailplane? No, because the problem says the wings have a total plan area of 320 ft², and the tail contributes 5% of lift, but the drag is for the wings alone.

Wait, no, the problem says: "the drag coefficient of the wings is 0.055, and the total drag is 1.75 times that caused by the wings alone."

So total drag =1.75 * D_wings.

So my calculation should be correct, leading to approximately 1,918 lbf. The options don't have this, so perhaps I made a mistake in part (a) which affects part (b).

Wait, no, part (a) is about lift coefficient, part (b) is about drag, so they're separate.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Looking for Cl around 0.85 and thrust around 1918, the closest is option A: 0.85, 1937.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the dynamic pressure.

Let me compute q again, but more accurately.

q = (0.5 * 0.076 * 230^2) /32.174.

Compute 230^2=52,900.

0.5*0.076=0.038.

0.038*52,900=2008.2.

2008.2 /32.174 = let's compute:

32.174 *62= 32.174*60=1,930.44; 32.174*2=64.348 → total 1,994.788.

62*32.174=1,994.788.

2008.2 -1,994.788=13.412.

So 62 + (13.412/32.174) ≈62 +0.416≈62.416.

So q≈62.416 psf.

Now D_wings=62.416 *320 *0.055.

62.416 *320 = let's compute:

60*320=19,200.

2.416*320=773.12.

Total=19,200+773.12=19,973.12.

19,973.12 *0.055=1,098.52 lbf.

D_total=1.75*1,098.52=1,917.41 lbf.

Hmm, so about 1,917 lbf.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A:1937, which is 20 lbf higher. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider more precise calculations, but perhaps the intended answer is option A:0.85 and 1937 lbf.

But wait, let me check the options again. Option E is 0.78, 2032. Hmm, that's higher than my calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in part (a).

Wait, in part (a), I got Cl_wings≈0.855, which rounds to 0.85, matching option A. So part (a) is 0.85.

Then for part (b), if the answer is approximately 1,917, but the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is option A:1937 lbf, which is 1937. Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the dynamic pressure using the exact value.

q = (0.5 *0.076 lbm/ft³ *230^2 ft²/s²) /32.174 lbm/slug.

Let me compute each step precisely:

0.5 *0.076 =0.038 lbm/(ft·s²).

v²=230^2=52,900 ft²/s².

Multiply:0.038 *52,900 =2,008.2 lbm/(ft·s²).

Now, divide by 32.174 lbm/slug:

2,008.2 /32.174 =62.431 lb/(ft·s²) → which is lb/ft², so 62.431 psf.

So D_wings=62.431 *320 *0.055.

Compute 62.431 *320 =19,977.92.

19,977.92 *0.055 =1,098.786 lbf.

D_total=1.75 *1,098.786≈1,918.38 lbf.

So approximately 1,918.38 lbf.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A:1937 lbf, which is 1937. The difference is about 19 lbf. Maybe the intended answer is A:0.85, 1937.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the problem considers the total wing area as 320, but perhaps that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the total drag includes the drag from the tailplane as well. But the problem states that the tail contributes 5% to the lift, but says nothing about drag. So perhaps the total drag is only from the wings and other parts, but the problem states that the wings' drag is 0.055, and total drag is 1.75 times that. So I think my approach is correct.

So, putting it all together, part (a) is 0.85 and part (b) is approximately 1918 lbf, which is closest to option A's 1937. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the total drag includes other components, but the problem says the wings' Cd is 0.055, and total drag is 1.75 times that. So I think the approach is correct.

Therefore, the answer would be option A:0.85, 1937 lbf.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the two parts systematically:

### Part (a): Lift Coefficient of the Wings
The total lift force required to support the airplane's weight is 18,000 lbf. The tailplane contributes 5% of this lift, so the lift from the wings alone is:

\[
L_{\text{wings}} = 18,000 - (0.05 \times 18,000) = 17,100 \, \text{lbf}.
\]

The lift force equation is:

\[
L = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 S C_l,
\]

where:
- \(\rho = 0.076 \, \text{lbm/ft}^3\) (converted to slugs: \(\rho = 0.002362 \, \text{slugs/ft}^3\)),
- \(v = 230 \, \text{ft/s}\),
- \(S = 320 \, \text{ft}^2\),
- \(C_l\) is the lift coefficient.

Rearranging for \(C_l\):

\[
C_l = \frac{L_{\text{wings}}}{\frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 S}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
C_l = \frac{17,100}{0.5 \times 0.002362 \times 230^2 \times 320} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the lift coefficient of the wings is approximately **0.85**.

---

### Part (b): Forward Thrust Required
The total drag is 1.75 times the drag caused by the wings alone. The drag force equation is:

\[
D = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 S C_d,
\]

where:
- \(C_d = 0.055\),
- \(\rho = 0.076 \, \text{lbm/ft}^3\),
- \(v = 230 \, \text{ft/s}\),
- \(S = 320 \, \text{ft}^2\).

First, calculate the dynamic pressure \(q\):

\[
q = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 = \frac{0.5 \times 0.076 \times 230^2}{32.174} \approx 62.43 \, \text{psf}.
\]

The drag force on the wings is:

\[
D_{\text{wings}} = q \times S \times C_d = 62.43 \times 320 \times 0.055 \approx 1,098.77 \, \text{lbf}.
\]

The total drag is:

\[
D_{\text{total}} = 1.75 \times D_{\text{wings}} \approx 1.75 \times 1,098.77 \approx 1,918.34 \, \text{lbf}.
\]

The forward thrust required to overcome this drag is approximately **1,918 lbf**. Among the options, the closest value is **1,937 lbf**.

---

### Final Answer
Combining the results from both parts, the correct option is:

**A: 0.85, 1937 lbf**

ANSWER: A
