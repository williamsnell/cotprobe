Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again: The entire power from a 100-hp automobile engine is used to agitate 50 kg of water that's thermally insulated. I need to find out how long it takes for the water's temperature to rise by 10 degrees Celsius. The options are A to J, with various seconds.

Hmm, I remember that when you're dealing with heating and power, it involves some thermodynamics. The key here is probably the energy transfer. Since the engine's power is being used to agitate the water, that means the engine is doing work on the water, which increases its internal energy, hence the temperature rise.

First, I think I need to calculate the total energy required to raise the temperature of the water. The formula for that is Q = mcΔT, where m is mass, c is specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the temperature change. I know that water has a specific heat capacity of 4186 J/kg°C. So, let's plug in the numbers: m=50 kg, c=4186, ΔT=10.

Calculating Q: 50 * 4186 * 10. Let me do that. 50 multiplied by 4186 is 209,300. Then multiplied by 10 gives 2,093,000 joules. So Q is 2,093,000 J.

Next, I need to relate this energy to the power from the engine. Power is energy per unit time, so P = W/t. Here, the engine's power is 100 hp. Wait, but I need to convert horsepower to watts because the energy is in joules and time in seconds. I remember that 1 horsepower is approximately 745.7 watts. So 100 hp is 100 * 745.7 = 74,570 watts.

So the engine is providing 74,570 joules per second. Now, the engine is working at full power for the entire time, and all that energy goes into heating the water. So the time t is the total energy needed divided by the power. That is t = Q / P.

Plugging in the numbers: t = 2,093,000 J / 74,570 W. Let me compute that. Let's see, 2,093,000 divided by 74,570. Let me approximate this. 74,570 times 28 is roughly 74,570 * 28. Let's compute: 74,570 * 20 = 1,491,400. 74,570 * 8 = 596,560. So total 2,087,960. That's very close to 2,093,000. So t is approximately 28 seconds.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. 74,570 multiplied by 28: 74,570 * 28 = (70,000 *28) + (4,570*28). 70,000*28=1,960,000. 4,570*28: 4,570 *20=91,400; 4,570*8=36,560. So 91,400+36,560=127,960. Adding to 1,960,000 gives 2,087,960 J. The required Q is 2,093,000 J, so the difference is about 5,040 J. That's about a 5,040 / 74,570 ≈ 0.0675 seconds. So total time is approximately 28.0675 seconds. Looking at the options, option C is 28 seconds, which matches this result.

So I think the correct answer is C.

To determine how long it takes for the temperature of 50 kg of water to rise by 10°C using a 100-hp engine, we calculate the energy required and the time based on the engine's power.

1. **Energy Required (Q):**  
   Using the formula \( Q = mc\Delta T \):  
   - \( m = 50 \, \text{kg} \)  
   - \( c = 4186 \, \text{J/kg°C} \) (specific heat of water)  
   - \( \Delta T = 10 \, \text{°C} \)  
   \( Q = 50 \times 4186 \times 10 = 2,093,000 \, \text{J} \).

2. **Engine Power (P):**  
   Convert 100 hp to watts:  
   \( 1 \, \text{hp} = 745.7 \, \text{W} \), so  
   \( P = 100 \times 745.7 = 74,570 \, \text{W} \).

3. **Time (t):**  
   Using \( t = \frac{Q}{P} \):  
   \( t = \frac{2,093,000}{74,570} \approx 28 \, \text{seconds} \).

Thus, the time required is approximately **28 seconds**.
