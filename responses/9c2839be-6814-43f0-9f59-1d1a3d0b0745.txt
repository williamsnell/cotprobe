Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light transmission through glass. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says that the absorption coefficient α is 0.05 mm⁻¹. We need to find out what percentage of light is transmitted through a 4 mm thick glass plate. The options are A to J, and I have to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that the absorption coefficient relates to how much light is absorbed as it passes through a material. But wait, the transmission depends on both absorption and any reflection that might occur. Oh right, but sometimes problems assume that all the loss is due to absorption, especially if they give the absorption coefficient. So maybe I don't need to worry about reflection here.

The formula I think I should use is the Beer-Lambert law, which describes the attenuation of light as it passes through a medium. The law states that the intensity of light after passing through a material is I = I₀ * e^(-α * x), where I₀ is the initial intensity, I is the transmitted intensity, α is the absorption coefficient, and x is the thickness of the material.

Wait, but wait a second. The absorption coefficient, as given, is 0.05 mm⁻¹. So the units are inverse millimeters. The thickness is 4 mm, so x=4 mm. Let me make sure the units match. Since α is per mm, and x is in mm, that should be fine.

So, plugging in the numbers: I = I₀ * e^(-0.05 *4). Let me calculate that exponent first. 0.05 multiplied by 4 is 0.2. So the exponent is -0.2. Now I need to compute e^-0.2.

I think e^-0.2 is approximately... Let me recall that e^0.2 is about 1.2214. So e^-0.2 would be 1 divided by that, which is roughly 0.8187. So the transmitted intensity is about 81.87% of the original.

Wait, but wait again. Some sources might present the absorption coefficient as the fraction absorbed per unit length, but I think in this case, it's correct to use it in the Beer-Lambert formula. So the transmission is 81.87%, which would correspond to option B.

Let me double-check the options. Option B is 81.87%, which matches my calculation. So the answer should be B.

The absorption coefficient α is 0.05 mm⁻¹, and the glass plate is 4 mm thick. Using the Beer-Lambert law, the transmitted intensity is I = I₀ * e^(-α * x). Substituting α = 0.05 mm⁻¹ and x = 4 mm, the exponent becomes -0.2. Calculating e^-0.2 ≈ 0.8187, which means approximately 81.87% of the light is transmitted. This corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
