Question:

I don't understand why everyone thinks they belong in college. After all, everyone knows that when you are intelligent you'll succeed. But so many people that elect to attend college don't have even the most basic intelligence. How do they expect to get anywhere here?

Options:

A: Attacking the Person (ad hominem)
B: Straw Man
C: Denying the Antecedent
D: Begging the Question

Okay, so I have this question about logical fallacies, and I need to figure out which one applies here. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is: "I don't understand why everyone thinks they belong in college. After all, everyone knows that when you are intelligent you'll succeed. But so many people that elect to attend college don't have even the most basic intelligence. How do they expect to get anywhere here?"

The options are A through D, each being a type of logical fallacy. I need to determine which fallacy is used in this argument.

First, let me break down the argument. The speaker is expressing frustration about people going to college. They argue that intelligence leads to success, implying that only intelligent people should go to college. Then they say that many college attendees lack basic intelligence and thus won't succeed. So, the argument seems to link intelligence directly to college success, and criticizes those who aren't intelligent for trying.

Now, I need to recall the definitions of each fallacy to see which one fits.

Option A: Attacking the Person (ad hominem). This is when someone attacks the person instead of the argument. For example, saying someone's argument is wrong because they're not smart or because of their background. But in this case, the argument isn't attacking individuals but rather making a general claim about intelligence and college success.

Option B: Straw Man. This is when someone misrepresents an opponent's argument to make it easier to attack. The speaker here isn't misrepresenting; they're making a claim about intelligence leading to success, not responding to another argument.

Option C: Denying the Antecedent. This fallacy occurs when someone argues that if A leads to B, then not A means not B. It's a flawed reasoning because the absence of A doesn't necessarily lead to the absence of B. The speaker's argument seems to suggest that because intelligence leads to success, anyone without intelligence won't succeed. Wait, that's exactly the structure of denying the antecedent. So if A (intelligence) leads to B (success), then not A (lacking intelligence) leads to not B (not succeeding). That's a classic denying the antecedent fallacy.

Option D: Begging the Question. This is when the argument assumes what it's trying to prove. The speaker is assuming that intelligence is the sole factor for college success, which is what they're trying to prove, but that's not exactly the case here. It's more about the structure of the argument rather than circular reasoning.

Wait, but let me think again. The speaker is saying that because intelligent people succeed, those who aren't intelligent shouldn't go to college. So the structure is: If intelligent, then succeed. Therefore, if not intelligent, then not succeed. That's exactly the denying the antecedent fallacy. Because just because A implies B doesn't mean not A implies not B. There could be other factors contributing to success beyond intelligence.

So the fallacy here is C: Denying the Antecedent.

The argument presented uses the structure of denying the antecedent fallacy by incorrectly inferring that the absence of intelligence (not A) leads to the absence of success (not B), despite intelligence not being the sole determinant of success. 

Answer: C
