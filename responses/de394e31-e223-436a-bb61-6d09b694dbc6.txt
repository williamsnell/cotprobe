Alright, I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question: "As of 2019, about what percentage of the global population does not have access to safe drinking water?" The options provided are A through J, with numbers ranging from 10% to 100%. 

First, I need to recall any information I know about global access to safe drinking water. I remember that access to clean water is a significant issue, especially in developing countries. I think the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF have reports on this. From what I've heard before, a substantial portion of the world's population doesn't have access to safe water, but I'm not exactly sure of the percentage.

I believe that in recent years, progress has been made, but many people still lack this basic necessity. I think the figure is somewhere around 10-20%, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, I might have heard that around 700 million people, which is roughly 10% of the global population, don't have access. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I might have mixed up the numbers from different years or sources.

Wait, another thought: I remember a target related to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) where the goal was to halve the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water by 2015. If the target was met, that would mean that around 20-25% of the population still didn't have access. But the question is about 2019, which is after the 2015 MDG deadline. So maybe the percentage improved a bit more after that.

Alternatively, I think the percentage might be higher. I've heard that about 2.2 billion people lacked safely managed drinking water in 2019. To put that into a percentage, I can estimate the global population around that time was about 7.7 billion. So, 2.2 divided by 7.7 is roughly 0.285, or about 28.5%. Looking at the options, F is 30%, which is close.

But wait, another angle: sometimes the data includes not just the absence of access but also the quality and safety of the water. Maybe the percentage is a bit higher. Alternatively, some sources might report it as around 20%, so D:20%. I'm a bit torn between 20% and 30%.

I should also consider if I'm confusing this with the percentage of people without access to sanitation, which is a related but different issue. Sanitation is often a higher percentage, around 40-50%, but that's not the question here.

To double-check, I think the WHO data from 2019 indicated that around 20-25% of the global population lacked access to safe drinking water. So the closest option would be D:20% or F:30%. Since 20-25% is closer to 20% than 30%, I'm leaning towards D:20%. But I'm not entirely sure because the exact figure might vary depending on the source and definitions used.

Wait, another thought: I read a report that stated approximately 2.2 billion people (which is roughly 28-29%) didn't have access to safe drinking water in 2019. So 28-29% would be closer to 30%, making option F the correct one. That makes me think F:30% is the right answer.

The answer is F:30%.
