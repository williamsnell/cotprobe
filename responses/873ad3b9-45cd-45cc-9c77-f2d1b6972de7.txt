Okay, so I have this question about reinforcement schedules, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by understanding the scenario. The question is about an ice cream parlor called Yellow Brick Road. Every time I buy ice cream, my over-the-rainbow card gets stamped. Once I purchase ten items, I get the next one free. So, the deal is that after ten stamps, I get a free item.

Hmm, reinforcement schedules... I remember from psychology that there are different types, like fixed-ratio, variable-ratio, fixed-interval, variable-interval, and continuous reinforcement. Let me think about each of these.

Fixed-ratio means the reinforcement is given after a specific number of responses. So, like, every 10th ice cream purchase gets a free one. That sounds exactly like what's happening here. Once you get ten items, the next is free. So that's a fixed number of responses leading to reinforcement.

Variable-ratio would be when the number of responses needed varies. Like a slot machine where you don't know how many pulls it'll take to win. But in this case, it's always ten, so it's not variable.

Fixed-interval is when reinforcement is given after a set time, not based on the number of responses. Like getting a reward every hour, regardless of how many tasks you've done. That doesn't fit here because it's based on the number of items purchased, not time.

Variable-interval is even less predictable in timing. So that's not it either. Continuous reinforcement is giving a reward after every single response, which isn't the case here because you only get a free item after ten.

Wait, the options also include H: Partial reinforcement, which I think is a broader category. Partial reinforcement means not every response is reinforced. So fixed-ratio is a type of partial reinforcement. But the question is asking which specific schedule, so E: Fixed-ratio seems more precise.

Other options like D: Variable-ratio with extinctionâ€”extinction is when you stop reinforcing, but the question isn't about stopping; it's about the current schedule. So D doesn't fit. I: Ratio reinforcement is a general term, but E is more specific. J: Fixed-variable doesn't make much sense as a category.

So putting it all together, the schedule is fixed-ratio because after a fixed number (ten) of purchases, you get a free item. So the answer should be E.

The scenario describes a fixed-ratio reinforcement schedule because a free item is given after a set number of purchases (ten). This fits the definition of fixed-ratio, where reinforcement is delivered after a specific number of responses.

Answer: E
