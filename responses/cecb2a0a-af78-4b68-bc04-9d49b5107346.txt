Okay, so I need to figure out what cultural relativism means based on the given options. I remember from my studies that relativism generally refers to the idea that something is relative and depends on context. In this case, cultural relativism probably has to do with how culture affects some concept, likely human rights.

Looking at the options, I see several possibilities. Option A says human rights application is relative to each nation's laws. That makes sense because cultural relativism often involves respecting different cultural norms. So maybe it's about how human rights are applied differently based on where you are.

Option B suggests laws should validate human rights. That sounds more like a legal standpoint rather than a cultural one. I'm not sure about that one yet.

Option C talks about global consensus determining human rights. That seems more like a universalist view, not relativistic. Relativism is about differences, so this might not be right.

Option D says human rights have a cultural origin. That seems plausible because different cultures might have different takes on what rights are important.

Option E claims all cultures are objectively equal. I think relativism isn't about equality but about perspective. So E might be incorrect.

Option F says human rights should be the same everywhere. That's the opposite of relativism because it's about universality, not relative to culture.

Option G ties human rights to religious beliefs. While religion can influence culture, I'm not sure if that's the main point of cultural relativism.

Option H suggests human rights apply equally without restrictions. Again, that sounds more universalist than relativist.

Option I says human rights depend on individual beliefs. That could be a form of relativism, but I think cultural relativism is broader than just individual beliefs.

Option J states local culture validates all human rights. That seems similar to option A but more about local validation.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Cultural relativism is the idea that one's own culture is the only lens through which one can evaluate right and wrong. So it's about not imposing one's own cultural standards on others. In the context of human rights, this would mean that human rights are understood and applied differently in different cultures.

Looking again, option A says human rights application is relative to each nation's laws. That aligns with the idea that each culture (nation) applies rights based on their own laws and norms. Option J says local culture should validate all human rights, which sounds a bit too absolute, like all rights must fit local culture, which might not be the case.

So between A and J. Cultural relativism would support that each culture has its own perspective, so maybe A is correct. But I'm also considering D, which says human rights have a cultural origin. That could be part of it, but the question is about the meaning of cultural relativism, not the origin.

Wait, I think the key point is that cultural relativism posits that human rights are not universal but are defined within each culture's context. So looking at the options, option A says the application is relative to each nation's laws, which fits. Option J says local culture validates all human rights, which might be more about each culture accepting rights but perhaps in their own way.

Alternatively, option D is about origin, not application. So the meaning of cultural relativism is more about the perspective and application varying by culture, not the origin. So A or J.

Wait, another thought: cultural relativism doesn't mean that each culture can define rights however they want without any consideration for others. It's more about understanding and respecting different cultural practices. So perhaps option A is about applying human rights according to each nation's laws, which could be a form of relativism.

Alternatively, option J says local culture validates all human rights, which might imply that each culture determines what rights are valid, which could be a form of relativism. But I think the main idea is that the application varies, not necessarily that each culture validates all rights.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. Cultural relativism in the context of human rights would mean that the interpretation and enforcement of human rights are shaped by the cultural context of each society. So each culture applies human rights according to their own laws and values. That would point to option A, which says the application is relative to each nation's laws.

Alternatively, option J is about local culture validating all human rights, which might suggest that each culture must accept all rights, but that doesn't fit as well with relativism. Relativism is more about differences in approach rather than universal acceptance.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Another approach: look for the term "relative". Cultural relativism is about things being relative to culture. So the statement should reflect that human rights are relative, not absolute.

Looking at the options:

A: Application is relative to laws in each nation. So each nation applies human rights according to their laws, which are cultural.

D: Human rights have cultural origin. So their existence is tied to culture.

E: Determined by global consensus – opposite of relativism.

F: Universally same – opposite.

So, perhaps option D is more about the origin, while the question is about the meaning of cultural relativism, which is about the application or perspective being relative.

Wait, the question is "What is the meaning of cultural relativism?" So it's about the theory, not just the application. Cultural relativism is the idea that concepts are understood differently in different cultures. So in terms of human rights, it would mean that what counts as a human right is determined by the culture, not universally applicable.

So looking back, option D says human rights have a cultural origin, which would mean they arise from culture, which is part of the idea. But the overall meaning is more about relativism being the theory that things are relative to culture.

Alternatively, option A is about application, which is a result of the theory.

Wait, perhaps the best way is to recall the definition. Cultural relativism is the principle that an individual's beliefs and practices should be understood based on their own culture. So when applied to human rights, it suggests that human rights are not universal but are defined and understood within specific cultural contexts.

So, looking at the options, the one that says human rights are determined by each nation's laws (A) or by global consensus (C), etc. Option D is about origin, but the question is about the meaning of the theory, not the origin.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D: human rights have a cultural origin. Because cultural relativism posits that concepts like human rights arise from and are shaped by culture, meaning they are not universal.

Alternatively, option A is about application, which is a consequence of the theory. The question is about the meaning of cultural relativism, so it's about the theory itself, not just the application.

So, to clarify, cultural relativism is the idea that concepts are relative to culture, so human rights are determined by cultural context, not universal. So the correct option would be D: human rights have a cultural origin.

Wait, but another thought: cultural relativism doesn't necessarily say that human rights have a cultural origin, but rather that the perception and application of human rights are relative to culture. So the theory is about the relativity of values, not their origin.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should consider that cultural relativism is the belief that there is no absolute or universal standard by which to judge another culture's practices. So when it comes to human rights, it's about not imposing one's own cultural standards on others.

So, looking at the options, option A says the application is relative to each nation's laws. That sounds correct because each culture applies rights based on their own laws, which reflects their cultural perspective.

Alternatively, option J says local culture should validate all human rights, which might imply that each culture must accept all rights, but that's more about validation rather than relativism.

I think I'm leaning towards option A. So the answer is A.
</think>

The meaning of cultural relativism is the idea that concepts, such as human rights, are understood and applied differently within various cultural contexts. It emphasizes that these concepts are relative to the cultural norms and values of each society, rather than being universally applicable. This perspective respects the diversity of cultural practices and avoids imposing one culture's standards on another.
