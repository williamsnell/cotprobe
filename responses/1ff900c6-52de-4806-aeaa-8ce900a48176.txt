Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's break down each part carefully.

The question has two statements, and I need to evaluate whether each is true or false, then select the option that correctly describes their status. The options are labeled A through J, with each option making a claim about the truth of the statements and sometimes categorizing them.

First, let me tackle Statement 1: "For a continuous random variable x and its probability distribution function p(x), it holds that 0 ≤ p(x) ≤ 1 for all x." 

I remember that for probability distribution functions, whether they're for discrete or continuous variables, the probabilities must lie between 0 and 1. For discrete variables, like a die roll, each outcome's probability is between 0 and 1, and they sum to 1. For continuous variables, the PDF (probability density function) doesn't give the probability at a point directly, but the integral over an interval gives the probability. However, the PDF itself must still satisfy 0 ≤ p(x) ≤ 1 for all x. So Statement 1 is definitely true.

Now, Statement 2: "Decision tree is learned by minimizing information gain." 

Wait, that doesn't sound quite right. I recall that when building decision trees, especially in algorithms like ID3, C4.5, or CART, the splitting of nodes is based on maximizing information gain, not minimizing it. Information gain measures how well a given attribute separates the training examples according to their target classification. So the algorithm chooses the attribute that gives the highest information gain. If you minimized information gain, you'd be making the tree worse in terms of separating the classes. So Statement 2 is false.

So now, I need to look at the options to see which one says Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false.

Looking at the options:

A: Statement 1 is a well-known inequality in calculus, Statement 2 is a common method in data mining. Hmm, Statement 1 isn't exactly a calculus inequality; it's more of a probability axiom. And Statement 2's description is incorrect because it's not about minimizing info gain.

B: Statement 1 is a theorem in real analysis, Statement 2 is a principle in information theory. Again, Statement 1 isn't a theorem in real analysis; it's a basic probability property. Also, Statement 2's claim about info theory is incorrect.

C: Statement 1 is a fundamental principle of statistics, Statement 2 is a rule of thumb in decision analysis. Well, Statement 1 is indeed a fundamental principle, but Statement 2 is incorrect. So this option is wrong because the second part is false.

D: False, True. No, because Statement 1 is true, so D is incorrect.

E: False, False. No, because Statement 1 is true, so E is wrong.

F: True, True. No, because Statement 2 is false.

G: Statement 1 is a fundamental principle of probability, Statement 2 is a common algorithm for machine learning. Statement 1 is correct, but Statement 2 is incorrect because decision trees aren't learned by minimizing info gain. So G is wrong.

H: Statement 1 is a key concept in measure theory, Statement 2 is a method used in decision theory. Measure theory is more about the mathematical foundations, but Statement 1 is more about probability basics. Statement 2's claim is wrong, so H is incorrect.

I: Statement 1 is a property of all random variables, Statement 2 is a heuristic used in AI. Statement 1 is correct, but Statement 2 is incorrect because it's about maximizing, not minimizing. So I is wrong.

J: True, False. Yes, this matches our earlier assessment: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false.

So the correct answer should be J.

The correct answer is J: True, False.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Statement 1 Analysis**: For a continuous random variable, the probability density function (PDF) must satisfy 0 ≤ p(x) ≤ 1 for all x. This is a fundamental property of probability distributions, ensuring that probabilities are valid. Hence, Statement 1 is true.

2. **Statement 2 Analysis**: Decision trees are constructed by maximizing information gain, not minimizing it. Maximizing information gain ensures the best separation of classes, leading to optimal tree structure. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.

3. **Option Matching**: Among the options provided, only option J correctly identifies Statement 1 as true and Statement 2 as false.

**Answer: J**
