Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the future value of an investment. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says that the investment is $1,000, the interest rate is 8% compounded annually, and the time period is 3 years. I need to find the future value from the given options.

First, I remember that compound interest means that the interest is calculated on the initial principal and also on the accumulated interest from previous periods. The formula for compound interest is:

Future Value (FV) = Principal × (1 + Rate)^Time

So, plugging in the numbers I have: Principal is $1,000, Rate is 8% which is 0.08 in decimal, and Time is 3 years.

Let me write that out:

FV = 1000 × (1 + 0.08)^3

Calculating the part inside the parentheses first: 1 + 0.08 is 1.08. Then I need to raise that to the power of 3 because it's compounded annually for 3 years.

So, 1.08 cubed. Let me calculate that step by step.

First, 1.08 × 1.08. Hmm, 1 times 1 is 1, 1 times 0.08 is 0.08, 0.08 times 1 is 0.08, and 0.08 times 0.08 is 0.0064. Adding those up: 1 + 0.08 + 0.08 + 0.0064. Wait, no, that's actually the expansion for (1 + 0.08)^2. Let me compute 1.08 squared first.

1.08 × 1.08:
- 1 × 1 = 1
- 1 × 0.08 = 0.08
- 0.08 × 1 = 0.08
- 0.08 × 0.08 = 0.0064
Adding all together: 1 + 0.08 + 0.08 + 0.0064 = 1.1664. So, 1.08 squared is 1.1664.

Now, I need to multiply that by 1.08 again to get the cube, which is the third power.

So, 1.1664 × 1.08. Let me compute that.

Breaking it down:
- 1 × 1.1664 = 1.1664
- 0.08 × 1.1664 = ?

Calculating 0.08 × 1.1664:
Multiply 1.1664 by 8 (since 0.08 is 8/100). 1.1664 × 8 = 9.3312. Then divide by 100, which gives 0.093312.

So, adding 1.1664 and 0.093312 together: 1.1664 + 0.093312 = 1.259712.

So, 1.08^3 is approximately 1.259712.

Now, multiplying that by the principal, which is $1,000.

FV = 1000 × 1.259712 = 1259.712.

Looking at the options, I see option E is 1259.71, which matches closely. Let me check the other options to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Option D is 1261.00, which is a bit higher. Hmm, maybe I should double-check my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a rounding error when calculating 1.08^3. Let me compute it more accurately.

Calculating 1.08 × 1.08 × 1.08:

First, 1.08 × 1.08 = 1.1664 (as before).

Now, 1.1664 × 1.08:

Let me compute this precisely:

1.1664 × 1.08
= (1 + 0.1664) × 1.08
= 1 × 1.08 + 0.1664 × 1.08
= 1.08 + (0.1664 × 1.08)

Calculating 0.1664 × 1.08:

0.1664 × 1 = 0.1664
0.1664 × 0.08 = 0.013312
Adding those: 0.1664 + 0.013312 = 0.179712

So, total is 1.08 + 0.179712 = 1.259712.

So, that part was correct. Therefore, 1.08^3 is indeed 1.259712, so the future value is $1,259.71.

Looking back at the options, E is 1259.71, which must be the correct answer.

I think I'm confident with that. The other options, like D, are close but a bit higher, so perhaps they used a different method or rounding. But according to the formula, E is the right choice.

The future value is calculated using the compound interest formula, resulting in $1,259.71, which corresponds to option E.
