Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these places was the last to be inhabited by humans. The options are A through J, each a different island or group of islands. Let me list them out to make sure I have them all: Madagascar, Australia, Hawaii, New Zealand, Maldives, Fiji, Tahiti, Timor, Vanuatu, and New Guinea.

I remember that humans spread out from Africa to other parts of the world, and islands were colonized at different times. The key here is to find the last one, the most recent in terms of human occupation.

First, let's think about the general timeline. The earliest humans were in continents like Australia, which was connected to Southeast Asia during the Ice Ages. Australia was probably colonized around 60,000 years ago or so. Then, as sea levels rose, people started moving to nearby islands.

Madagascar is interesting because it's far off the coast of Africa. I think it's one of the last places to be colonized, maybe around 2,000 to 3,000 years ago. People from Borneo or Southeast Asia might have reached there by boat.

Hawaii is in the middle of the Pacific, so it's a long way from any continent. I think Polynesian people colonized Hawaii around 1,500 to 2,000 years ago. They were skilled navigators, so they could reach these remote islands.

New Zealand is another place that was colonized by the Polynesians, the Māori people, around 700 to 1,000 years ago. They were the first to arrive there, and European contact came much later.

The Maldives are in the Indian Ocean, south of India. I think they were settled by people from the nearby coasts, maybe around 5,000 years ago, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact date.

Fiji is part of the Pacific Islands and was settled by Austronesian people around 3,500 years ago, if I remember correctly. Then, later, Polynesians came and added to the population.

Tahiti is part of French Polynesia. The Society Islands, which include Tahiti, were settled around 3,000 years ago by Polynesian migrants.

Timor is in Southeast Asia, near Australia and Indonesia. It was probably colonized by people moving from the mainland or nearby islands, maybe around 4,000 to 5,000 years ago.

Vanuatu is another Pacific island group. I think it was settled around 3,000 years ago by Lapita people, who were Austronesian.

New Guinea is interesting because it's a large island and was part of the same landmass as Australia during the Ice Age. It was colonized around 50,000 years ago, maybe even earlier.

Putting this all together, I need to find the latest date. Madagascar and Hawaii were both settled around 2,000-3,000 years ago. But wait, I think Hawaii might have been later. Let me check: Polynesians reached Hawaii around 1200 AD, which is about 800 years ago. Madagascar was settled around 300 BC, which is 2,300 years ago. So that's earlier than Hawaii.

Wait, no, I might have that wrong. I think the Polynesian expansion into the Pacific started around 3,000 years ago, but some islands like Hawaii were reached much later. For example, New Zealand was settled around 1,000 years ago, and Hawaii maybe around 800 years ago. So in that case, Hawaii would be the last.

But wait, another thought: were there any islands in the Pacific that were colonized even later than Hawaii? I'm trying to remember if any of the options were settled after Hawaii. The Maldives, for example, were settled earlier, around 5,000 years ago. So the last would be among the more distant Pacific islands.

Let me think again. The timeline for Pacific colonization: the Lapita people started moving out of Taiwan around 3,500 years ago, reaching places like Fiji, Vanuatu, and Tonga. Then, the Polynesians came later, around 1,000 years ago, reaching places like the Marquesas, then Tahiti, then New Zealand, and finally Hawaii around 1200 AD.

So if that's the case, Hawaii would be the last among the options given. But looking at the options, I also see New Zealand as an option (D). Wait, New Zealand was settled around 1,000 years ago, which is earlier than Hawaii's 800 years ago. So Hawaii would be the last.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because some sources say that New Zealand was settled later than Hawaii. Let me try to recall: The Maori arrived in New Zealand around 1250-1300 AD, which is about the same time as the first Polynesian settlers in Hawaii. But I think that Hawaii was settled a bit later, maybe in the 12th or 13th century, while New Zealand was settled around the same time or slightly earlier.

Alternatively, maybe both were settled around the same time but by different groups. Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. If both were settled around the same time, but the question is which is the last, I need to determine which one came later.

Alternatively, perhaps the Maldives were settled later. Wait, no, the Maldives were settled much earlier, around 5,000 years ago. So the candidates are probably Hawaii and New Zealand.

Wait, another angle: The first Polynesian settlers in New Zealand arrived around 1250 AD, while Hawaii was settled around 1200 AD, so maybe New Zealand was a bit later. But I'm not entirely certain about the exact dates.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is Vanuatu. Wait, no, Vanuatu was settled around 3,000 years ago, which is earlier than both New Zealand and Hawaii.

Wait, I think I'm getting this mixed up. Let me try to list each option with their approximate settlement dates based on what I know:

A: Madagascar - around 2,500 years ago (300 BC)
B: Australia - 60,000+ years ago
C: Hawaii - around 1,200 AD (800 years ago)
D: New Zealand - around 1250 AD (770 years ago)
E: Maldives - around 5,000 years ago
F: Fiji - around 3,500 years ago
G: Tahiti - around 3,000 years ago
H: Timor - around 4,000-5,000 years ago
I: Vanuatu - around 3,000 years ago
J: New Guinea - 50,000+ years ago

So based on this, the latest would be New Zealand at around 1250 AD, followed by Hawaii at 1200 AD. Wait, but if New Zealand was settled in 1250, that's later than Hawaii's 1200. So New Zealand would be the last.

Wait, but I might have the dates inverted. Let me check: I think the first Polynesian settlers in Hawaii were around 1200 AD, and New Zealand was settled around 1250 AD. So New Zealand would be the last.

But wait, another thought: Some sources say that New Zealand was settled around 1300 AD, which is after Hawaii's 1200. So in that case, New Zealand would be the last.

Alternatively, if both were settled around the same time, but the question is asking for the last, then perhaps New Zealand is the answer.

Wait, but looking back at the options, the choices are A to J. So the options are:

A: Madagascar (2500 BC)
B: Australia (40,000+ BC)
C: Hawaii (1200 AD)
D: New Zealand (1250 AD)
E: Maldives (5000 BC)
F: Fiji (3500 BC)
G: Tahiti (3000 BC)
H: Timor (4000 BC)
I: Vanuatu (3000 BC)
J: New Guinea (50,000+ BC)

So based on this, the latest is D: New Zealand at 1250 AD, followed by C: Hawaii at 1200 AD. So the last would be D.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because some sources say that the first Polynesian settlers in New Zealand arrived around 1250 AD, while Hawaii was settled around 1200 AD. So that would make New Zealand the last.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C: Hawaii, if it was settled a bit later than New Zealand.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is A: Madagascar, but that was settled around 300 BC, which is earlier than the Pacific islands.

Wait, no, 300 BC is 2300 years ago, which is earlier than the 1200 AD and 1250 AD dates.

So the latest would be between C and D.

I think the correct answer is D: New Zealand, as it was settled around 1250 AD, making it the last among the options.

The question asks which of the given locations was the last to be inhabited by humans. To determine this, we analyze the approximate dates of human colonization for each option:

- **A: Madagascar** - Colonized around 300 BC (2,300 years ago).
- **B: Australia** - Inhabited over 60,000 years ago.
- **C: Hawaii** - First settled by Polynesians around 1200 AD (800 years ago).
- **D: New Zealand** - Inhabited by Māori people around 1250 AD (770 years ago).
- **E: Maldives** - Settled around 5,000 years ago.
- **F: Fiji** - Colonized around 3,500 years ago.
- **G: Tahiti** - Inhabited around 3,000 years ago.
- **H: Timor** - Settled around 4,000–5,000 years ago.
- **I: Vanuatu** - Colonized around 3,000 years ago.
- **J: New Guinea** - Inhabited around 50,000 years ago.

From this analysis, the most recent colonization occurred in **New Zealand** around 1250 AD, slightly after Hawaii's colonization around 1200 AD. Therefore, the last to be occupied by humans is **D: New Zealand**.
