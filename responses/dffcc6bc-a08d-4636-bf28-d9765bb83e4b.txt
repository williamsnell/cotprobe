Question:

A state has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor for any person to smoke a cigarette, cigar, or pipe in any restaurant, bar, cafe, or other establishment within the state. A defendant was tried in state court for violating the anti-smoking statute. The prosecution's evidence consisted of testimony regarding the defendant's cigarette smoking at a restaurant. During the prosecution's case-in-chief, they called a witness who testified to a prior conviction of the defendant that had been excluded by the judge in a pretrial hearing. The judge immediately granted a mistrial and excused the jury. The state prosecutor appealed the ruling under a statute that permitted prosecutorial appeals in such circumstances. The state won the appeal, but the prosecutor decided not to re-prosecute the defendant. However, the city attorney from the city in which the restaurant was located then sought to prosecute the defendant for the same incident under the city's anti-smoking ordinance, which was identical to the state statute. The city attorney planned to call as her only witness a man who testified at the defendant's first trial. The defendant moved to dismiss on the grounds that the prosecution of the city charge would violate his rights against double jeopardy. The court should

Options:

A: deny the motion, because the judge granted a mistrial.
B: grant the motion, because it is the same incident being prosecuted.
C: grant the motion, because the city attorney is using the same witness.
D: deny the motion, because the first trial resulted in a mistrial.
E: grant the motion, because the law and the evidence will be identical at the second trial.
F: deny the motion, because the city's anti-smoking ordinance is separate from the state statute.
G: grant the motion, because jeopardy attached in the first prosecution.
H: deny the motion, because the city has its own jurisdiction.
I: grant the motion, because the defendant was not re-prosecuted by the state.
J: deny the motion, because the city and the state are separate sovereigns.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this double jeopardy question. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the defendant was tried in state court for violating a state anti-smoking statute. During the trial, the prosecution called a witness who testified about the defendant's prior conviction. The judge granted a mistrial because that evidence was excluded in a pretrial hearing. The state appealed, won, but decided not to re-prosecute. Then, the city attorney, where the incident happened, prosecuted the defendant under the city's identical anti-smoking ordinance. The city's plan was to use the same witness from the first trial. The defendant moved to dismiss, claiming double jeopardy.

I remember that double jeopardy protects against being tried twice for the same offense by the same sovereign. Here, the state and city are both prosecuting, but they're separate entities. The state statute and city ordinance are identical, so the same conduct is being punished.

Wait, but in the first trial, the mistrial was granted. I think a mistrial can sometimes lead to retrial unless it was granted by the defendant or if it's manifestly unjust. But in this case, the mistrial was granted because the prosecution used inadmissible evidence, which might be a situation where the mistrial was declared without the defendant's consent. So under double jeopardy, a mistrial doesn't necessarily bar retrial unless it's a "manifest miscarriage of justice" or if the mistrial was declared by the judge on the defendant's motion.

But in this case, the state decided not to re-prosecute. Now, the city is prosecuting. The key here is whether the city and state are considered separate sovereigns. From what I recall, the dual sovereignty doctrine says that the state and federal governments are separate, so prosecuting the same conduct under state and federal law isn't double jeopardy. But does that apply to a city and state as well?

Cities are typically considered subdivisions of the state, so maybe they're not separate sovereigns. But some jurisdictions treat them differently. Wait, noâ€”the dual sovereignty doctrine applies to state and federal governments, not a city (which is a local government) and the state. So in this case, the city is part of the state, so prosecuting the same offense might be double jeopardy.

But wait, the ordinances are identical. So the same conduct is being prosecuted under the same law, just by the city instead of the state. If the city is considered the same sovereign as the state, then double jeopardy would apply. But if the city is a separate sovereign, then it's allowed.

I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think again. The state and city are both prosecuting the same conduct. The state statute and city ordinance are identical. The first trial ended in a mistrial, but the state decided not to re-prosecute. Now the city is prosecuting.

In the case of Bartkus v. Illinois, the Supreme Court held that a state and a city (as a political subdivision) are not separate sovereigns for double jeopardy purposes. So if the state prosecutes someone, the city can't prosecute for the same offense because they're part of the same sovereign.

Wait, but wait. Bartkus was about the state and a city, and the Court said that the city isn't a separate sovereign. So in that case, the second prosecution by the city would be barred by double jeopardy because it's the same sovereign.

So in this question, the defendant was tried by the state. The city is part of the state, so prosecuting the same offense would be double jeopardy. Therefore, the court should grant the motion to dismiss.

Looking at the options, the correct answer would be one that says the court should grant the motion because the city and state are the same sovereign, so double jeopardy applies. Let me check the options.

Option I says: grant the motion, because the defendant was not re-prosecuted by the state. Hmm, that's not exactly it. The issue is whether the city is a separate sovereign.

Option J: deny the motion, because the city and the state are separate sovereigns. But if Bartkus says they aren't, then J is incorrect.

Option E: grant the motion because the law and evidence will be identical. That's not the main issue here; the main issue is sovereignty.

Option F: deny the motion because the city's ordinance is separate. But if the city isn't a separate sovereign, then F is wrong.

Option H: deny because the city has its own jurisdiction. But if the city is part of the state, their jurisdiction is concurrent, so prosecuting the same offense would be double jeopardy.

Wait, I'm a bit shaky here. Another angle: the state and city are both prosecuting the same conduct under the same statute. If they're the same sovereign, double jeopardy applies. If not, it doesn't. The key is whether the city is a separate sovereign from the state.

In Bartkus, the Supreme Court held that a city is not a separate sovereign from the state. Therefore, the state and city are the same sovereign for double jeopardy purposes. So the second prosecution by the city would violate double jeopardy.

So the correct answer should be that the court should grant the motion because the same sovereign is prosecuting again. Looking at the options, which one says that?

Option I: grant the motion, because the defendant was not re-prosecuted by the state. That's not the reason; it's because the city is part of the same sovereign.

Option G: grant the motion, because jeopardy attached in the first prosecution. Jeopardy attached in the first trial, but the mistrial was granted. So this might not be the right reason.

Wait, in the first trial, jeopardy attached when the jury was sworn in. The mistrial was granted, so under double jeopardy, the state could have retried unless the mistrial was declared on the defendant's motion or for manifest injustice. But the state decided not to re-prosecute, so the mistrial ends the case for the state. Now the city is prosecuting, which is a separate entity but part of the same sovereign as the state.

So the correct reasoning is that the city and state are the same sovereign, so double jeopardy applies.

Looking again, which option states that the city and state are the same sovereign, thus granting the motion?

Option I says the defendant wasn't re-prosecuted by the state. That's not the main issue. The issue is whether the city is a separate sovereign.

Wait, none of the options directly state that the city and state are the same sovereign. Let me check the options again.

Option J says to deny because the city and state are separate sovereigns. But if they're not, then J is wrong.

Option I: grant because the defendant wasn't re-prosecuted by the state. That's not the main reason.

Option E: grant because the law and evidence are identical. That's more about the elements, but the key is sovereignty.

Option G: grant because jeopardy attached. But the mistrial was granted, so jeopardy didn't bar retrial. But the state didn't retry, so the city can't.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is I: grant the motion because the defendant was not re-prosecuted by the state. Because the state gave up, the city can't take over. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the correct answer is J, but I think J is incorrect because the city isn't a separate sovereign.

Wait, in the case of a mistrial, the state could have retried, but they chose not to. So the mistrial doesn't bar the city from prosecuting if they're separate sovereigns. But if they're the same, then it does.

In Bartkus, the Court held that a city is not a separate sovereign, so the state and city are the same. Therefore, the city can't prosecute after the state mistrial.

So the correct answer would be that the court should grant the motion. Looking for the option that says this.

Option I says: grant the motion, because the defendant was not re-prosecuted by the state. But that's not the main reason. The reason is that the same sovereign is prosecuting again.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is I because the state didn't re-prosecute, so the city can't. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is J, but I think J is wrong because the city isn't a separate sovereign.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The key is whether the city is a separate sovereign. If not, then double jeopardy applies. So the answer should be that the court grants the motion because the same sovereign is prosecuting again, making double jeopardy apply.

Looking at the options, which one says that? It seems none directly say that. Option I says the defendant wasn't re-prosecuted by the state. Maybe that's the reasoning.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is J, but I think J is incorrect because the city isn't a separate sovereign.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is I. Because the state didn't re-prosecute, the city can't. But I'm not sure if that's the right reasoning.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, but that's about identical evidence and law.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is I because the state didn't re-prosecute, so the city can't. I'm not entirely confident, but I think the correct reasoning is that the city and state are the same sovereign, so double jeopardy applies, so the motion should be granted. Therefore, the correct option would be I or another.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is I: grant the motion, because the defendant was not re-prosecuted by the state. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G, but G says because jeopardy attached, but the mistrial was granted, so jeopardy is still attached.

Wait, in the first trial, jeopardy attached, and the mistrial was granted. So under double jeopardy, the state could have retried, but they chose not to. The city, being part of the same sovereign, can't prosecute again.

So the correct answer should be that the court grants the motion because the same sovereign is prosecuting again. Looking at the options, the only one that says the court should grant the motion is options A-J.

Wait, looking again:

Option I: grant the motion, because the defendant was not re-prosecuted by the state. Hmm.

Option J: deny the motion, because the city and state are separate sovereigns. But if they're not, then J is wrong.

So the correct answer should be that the city can't prosecute because they're the same sovereign as the state, so the motion should be granted. Therefore, the correct option is I or another.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is I, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, but that's more about the evidence.

Wait, I think the correct answer is I: grant the motion, because the defendant was not re-prosecuted by the state. Because the state decided not to re-prosecute, the city can't take over. But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is J, but I think J is incorrect because the city isn't a separate sovereign.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. I think the correct answer is I, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E.

Wait, no, E is about identical evidence and law, which is true, but the main issue is sovereignty.

I think I'll go with I: grant the motion, because the defendant was not re-prosecuted by the state. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I because the state's decision not to re-prosecute means the city can't. So the correct answer is I.

The question revolves around the double jeopardy clause and whether the city and state are considered the same sovereign. The defendant was initially tried in state court, and the trial ended in a mistrial. The state decided not to re-prosecute, but the city, under its identical anti-smoking ordinance, sought to prosecute the defendant. 

Under the dual sovereignty doctrine, state and federal governments are separate sovereigns, but cities are typically considered subdivisions of the state. In *Bartkus v. Illinois*, the Supreme Court ruled that a city is not a separate sovereign from the state, meaning prosecuting the same conduct under the city's ordinance would violate double jeopardy. 

The state's decision not to re-prosecute does not allow the city to take over the prosecution for the same offense. Since the city is part of the same sovereign as the state, the second prosecution would infringe on the defendant's double jeopardy rights. Therefore, the court should grant the motion to dismiss.
