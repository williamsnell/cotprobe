Okay, so I've got this question about a quarter wave plate made of crystalline quartz. I'm a bit rusty on my optics, but let's see if I can work through this.

The question is asking for the minimum thickness required for a quarter wave plate. The wavelength given is 589 micrometers, which is actually in the near-infrared range, but I guess the calculation should still hold. The indices of refraction for quartz are given as n_e = 1.553 and n_o = 1.544. 

Wait, a quarter wave plate, right. I remember that a quarter wave plate is designed to change the polarization of light by 90 degrees. It works by having a thickness such that the light undergoes a phase shift of λ/4 when it passes through. But wait, since it's a wave plate, the thickness depends on the wavelength and the refractive index.

The formula I think I need is the thickness d = λ/(4n), where λ is the wavelength in vacuum (or air, since it's similar) and n is the refractive index. But wait, since the light is going through the crystal, the wavelength inside the crystal is λ/n. Oh wait no, the formula for the phase shift is based on the optical path length. So the physical thickness d multiplied by the refractive index n gives the optical path length. So for a quarter wave, the optical path length should be λ/4.

So the equation would be d * n = λ/4, which gives d = λ/(4n). That makes sense.

Now, the wavelength given is 589 micrometers. Wait, 589 micrometers is 589 x 10^-6 meters, which is 5890 nm. Hmm, but wait, wait. Wait a second, 589 nm is actually the wavelength of sodium light, but 589 micrometers is way longer. That's like in the infrared. Maybe I should double-check the units.

Wait, the question says 589m\mu. Oh, that's probably a typo, maybe 589 nm. Because 589 micrometers is way too long for typical optical applications. Oh, but maybe the question is correct as written. Let me think. 

Wait, no, 589 micrometers is 589 μm, which is 589 x 1e-6 meters. But in optics, visible light is around 400-700 nm, so 589 nm is visible. So perhaps the question meant 589 nm, which is 0.589 micrometers. Wait, no, 589 nm is 0.589 micrometers. So maybe the question says 589 micrometers, which is 589,000 nm, which is in the infrared. 

Wait, but let me proceed with what's given. The wavelength is 589 micrometers, so λ = 589e-6 meters, which is 589e-3 mm, since 1 mm is 1e-3 meters. Wait, no. 1 m = 1e3 mm, so 1e-6 m = 1e-3 mm. So 589e-6 m = 589e-3 mm = 0.589 mm. Hmm, that's a big wavelength, maybe in the IR. But perhaps the question is correct. Alternatively, maybe it's 589 nm, which would be 589e-9 meters, but let's proceed.

Wait, but wait another thing. The quarter wave plate's thickness depends on the refractive index. But which index do I use here? n_e or n_o? Oh, wait, because quartz is a crystal, and it has two indices of refraction for the two principal directions, the extraordinary and ordinary rays. But for a wave plate, especially a quarter wave plate, I think it's typically made for a specific polarization direction. But since the question doesn't specify, perhaps I need to use the maximum index to get the minimum thickness. Because using a higher n would result in a smaller d, as d is inversely proportional to n.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is d = λ/(4n). So if I use a higher n, d will be smaller. So to find the minimum possible thickness, I should use the maximum possible n, which is n_e = 1.553. Because that would give the smallest d, as higher n reduces d.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum thickness required. So perhaps the minimum possible thickness is using the maximum index, because that would make d as small as possible. Alternatively, maybe the question considers the ordinary index, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should check both and see which option matches.

So let's compute d for both n_e and n_o.

First, using n_e = 1.553.

λ = 589 micrometers = 589e-6 meters.

d = λ/(4n) = (589e-6 m) / (4 * 1.553) 

Let me compute the denominator: 4 * 1.553 = 6.212.

So d = 589e-6 / 6.212 ≈ ?

Let me calculate 589e-6 / 6.212.

589e-6 is 0.000589 meters.

0.000589 / 6.212 ≈ 9.48e-5 meters.

Convert to mm: 9.48e-5 meters * 1000 mm/m = 0.0948 mm. That's approximately 0.095 mm, which would be about 0.095 mm.

Looking at the options, option I is 0.16 mm, which is larger. Option E is 0.4 mm, which is bigger. Option D is 0.1 mm, which is close to 0.095 mm. Let me see: 0.095 mm is 0.095 mm, so the closest option would be D: 0.1 mm, but that's a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate.

589e-6 m is 0.000589 m.

4 * 1.553 = 6.212.

0.000589 / 6.212 = let's see:

0.000589 divided by 6.212.

Well, 6.212 times 0.000095 is approximately 0.000590, because 6.212 * 0.0001 is 0.0006212, which is a bit higher than 0.000589. So 0.000589 /6.212 is approximately 0.0000948 meters, which is 0.0948 mm, or about 0.095 mm.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.1 mm, which is 0.1 mm. That's close. But wait, perhaps I should use n_o instead.

Let's try with n_o = 1.544.

d = 589e-6 m / (4 * 1.544) = 589e-6 / 6.176 ≈ ?

Compute 589e-6 /6.176.

589e-6 is 0.000589.

0.000589 /6.176 ≈ 9.54e-5 meters, which is 0.0954 mm. So again approximately 0.095 mm.

Wait, so whether I use n_e or n_o, the thickness is about 0.095 mm. But the options don't have exactly 0.095 mm. The closest is option D: 0.1 mm. But wait, let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: 2.0 mm

B: 0.016 mm

C: 0.0016 mm

D: 0.1 mm

E: 0.4 mm

F: 0.8 mm

G: 0.025 mm

H: 3.2 mm

I: 0.16 mm

J: 1.6 mm

Hmm, 0.095 mm isn't exactly any option, but D is 0.1 mm, which is the closest. But wait, perhaps I messed up the wavelength. Because 589 micrometers is 589,000 nm, which is in the infrared, but perhaps the question actually meant 589 nm. Let me check that possibility.

If λ is 589 nm, then λ = 589e-9 meters.

So, d = (589e-9 m) / (4 * 1.553) = (589e-9) / 6.212 ≈ 9.48e-10 meters, which is 9.48e-7 mm, which is 0.000948 micrometers, or 0.948 nm. That's way too small, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the question intended λ = 589 nm, and the unit was written wrong.

Wait, but that would give d ≈ 0.000948 micrometers, or 0.000948 mm, which is 0.000948 mm. That's 0.000948 mm, which is 0.948e-3 mm, which is 0.000948 mm. Looking at the options, option C is 0.0016 mm, which is about 1.6e-3 mm, which is a bit larger than 0.948e-3 mm. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the maximum index, n_e, but let me compute again.

Wait, if λ is 589 nm, then:

d = 589e-9 m / (4 * 1.553) = 589e-9 / 6.212 ≈ 9.48e-11 meters, which is 9.48e-5 mm, which is 0.0000948 mm. That's 0.0948 micrometers, which is 94.8 nm. But none of the options match that. So perhaps the original assumption that λ is 589 micrometers is correct, and the problem is in the options.

Wait, but in the initial calculation, using λ=589e-6 m, and n=1.553, we got d≈0.095 mm, which is about 0.1 mm. That's option D.

But wait, let me check the options again. Option I is 0.16 mm, which is about twice 0.08 mm. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait another approach: perhaps the formula is d = λ/(4n), but sometimes people use the wavelength in the medium, which is λ_medium = λ_vacuum / n. So the optical path length is n*d = λ_vacuum/4.

So, yes, that's correct. So d = λ/(4n).

Wait, but maybe I should consider the wavelength in the medium. No, because the formula is based on the phase shift. So when light travels through a medium of thickness d, the optical path length is n*d, and that should equal λ/4 for a quarter wave.

So, with λ=589e-6 m, n=1.553,

d= (589e-6) / (4 * 1.553) = 589e-6 /6.212 ≈ 9.48e-5 m = 0.0948 mm.

Which is approximately 0.095 mm. So the closest option is D: 0.1 mm.

But wait, what if the question uses n_o instead? Let me compute with n=1.544.

d=589e-6 / (4*1.544) =589e-6 /6.176 ≈9.54e-5 m=0.0954 mm, which is the same as before, about 0.095 mm. So same conclusion.

But looking at the options, none of them is 0.095 mm. The closest is D: 0.1 mm. But wait, perhaps I should check if I made a calculation error.

Wait, 589e-6 divided by 6.212:

Let me compute 589e-6 /6.212.

589e-6 is 0.000589.

0.000589 divided by 6.212: Let's compute 6.212 * 0.000095 = 0.0005899, which is very close to 0.000589. So 0.000095 meters is 0.095 mm.

So yes, 0.095 mm is correct. But the options don't have that; D is 0.1 mm, which is about 0.01 mm larger. So perhaps the intended answer is D: 0.1 mm.

Wait, but let me think again. Oh wait, maybe I should use the maximum possible index to get the minimum thickness. Because using the higher index (n_e=1.553) would give a smaller d than using n_o=1.544. So perhaps the minimum thickness is when n is maximum, so d is minimum.

Wait, but in my calculation, both n_e and n_o gave almost the same d, about 0.095 mm, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum possible thickness, which would correspond to the maximum possible n, so n_e=1.553. So d=0.095 mm, which is closest to 0.1 mm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let me compute 589e-6 / (4 * 1.553) precisely.

4 * 1.553 = 6.212.

589e-6 = 0.000589.

So 0.000589 /6.212 = Let me compute this division.

6.212 × 0.000095 = 0.0005899, as before. So 0.000095 meters is 0.095 mm.

So 0.095 mm is the thickness. The options don't have that. But perhaps the options have a typo, or perhaps I messed up the wavelength.

Wait, maybe the wavelength is 589 nm, so 589e-9 m.

Then d=589e-9/(4*1.553)=589e-9/6.212≈9.48e-11 m=9.48e-5 mm=0.0000948 mm=0.0948 micrometers.

But the options don't have that either. So perhaps the intended answer is option I:0.16 mm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the quarter wave condition more carefully. The condition for a quarter wave plate is that the optical path difference (OPD) is λ/4, where λ is the wavelength in vacuum. So OPD = n*d = λ/4.

So d = λ/(4n).

But wait, sometimes the formula is given as d = λ/(4n), but sometimes it's expressed as d = λ/(8n) for a quarter wave plate, but no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the standard formula is d = λ/(4n), because for a phase change of λ/4, you need an optical path of λ/4, which is n*d = λ/4.

So I think my initial approach is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options again, 0.095 mm is approximately 0.1 mm, which is option D.

But wait, perhaps the calculation was done with n_o. Let me compute with n_o=1.544.

d=589e-6/(4*1.544)=589e-6/(6.176)= approximately 0.0000954 mm, which is 0.0954 mm, same as before.

So still about 0.095 mm, which is closest to D:0.1 mm.

But wait, I'm seeing that the options don't have 0.095 mm, but perhaps the answer is option I:0.16 mm, which is roughly double. Did I miss a factor of 2 somewhere?

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for a half-wave plate instead of a quarter-wave? But the question says quarter wave plate.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = λ/(2n) for a quarter wave, but that doesn't make sense because a half-wave would be λ/2. No, wait, no, quarter wave is λ/4.

Wait, maybe I should recheck the formula.

A quarter wave plate causes a phase shift of 90 degrees (λ/4), so the optical path length should be λ/4.

Thus, n*d = λ/4 → d=λ/(4n).

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, but perhaps the wavelength given is in the medium. Wait, no, because the wavelength in the medium is λ/n, but the formula uses λ in vacuum. So the formula is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is about the maximum thickness to avoid issues, but no, it's the minimum required.

So, to sum up, I think the correct answer is approximately 0.095 mm, which is closest to option D:0.1 mm.
</think>

The minimum thickness of a quarter wave plate made of crystalline quartz is determined by the formula:

\[
d = \frac{\lambda}{4n}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of light (given as \( 589 \, \mu\text{m} = 589 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \)) and \( n \) is the refractive index of the quartz. Since the question specifies the indices of refraction as \( n_e = 1.553 \) and \( n_o = 1.544 \), the minimum thickness corresponds to using the maximum refractive index, \( n_e = 1.553 \), as this minimizes \( d \).

Substituting the values:

\[
d = \frac{589 \times 10^{-6}}{4 \times 1.553} = \frac{589 \times 10^{-6}}{6.212} \approx 9.48 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{m} = 0.0948 \, \text{mm}
\]

This result is approximately \( 0.095 \, \text{mm} \), which is closest to option D: \( 0.1 \, \text{mm} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
