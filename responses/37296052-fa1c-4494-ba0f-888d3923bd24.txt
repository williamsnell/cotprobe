Okay, so I've got this question here about the change in Gibbs energy when the pressure on benzene is increased. Hmm, I remember that Gibbs energy is related to the thermodynamic properties of a system. The question gives me that the volume is 1.0 dm³, and the pressure goes from 1.0 atm to 100 atm. All gases are perfect, but wait, benzene is a liquid, right? Because at standard conditions, benzene is a liquid. Oh wait, but the question says all gases are perfect, but does that imply we're treating benzene as a gas here? Or maybe it's a typo, and they mean all substances are treated as perfect? I'm a bit confused. Wait, no, the question says "the change in Gibbs energy of 1.0 dm³ of benzene", so it's benzene, which is a liquid. But the question says all gases are perfect, so maybe they're considering benzene as a gas in this problem, even though in reality it's a liquid. Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe I should think about the formula for Gibbs energy change when pressure changes. The Gibbs free energy change at constant temperature is given by ΔG = VΔP, but wait, is that correct? Or is it something else. Oh right, for a process at constant temperature, the change in Gibbs energy can be approximated as ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1) for an ideal gas. But wait, benzene isn't a gas here, so maybe that's not applicable. Hmm, I'm getting stuck.

Wait, wait. Another approach: for a liquid, the volume doesn't change much with pressure. So the volume is approximately constant. So the change in Gibbs energy when pressure changes can be approximated by ΔG ≈ VΔP. Because for a liquid, the compressibility is very low, so the volume change is negligible. So the formula would be ΔG = V (P2 - P1), but wait, are the pressures in the same units as the volume?

Wait, the volume is given in dm³, which is liters, and pressure is in atm. Oh, right, I remember that 1 dm³ is equal to 1 liter, and 1 liter·atm is approximately 101.325 J. So I can convert the pressure change into energy using the volume.

So let's calculate. The volume V is 1.0 dm³. The pressure increases from 1 atm to 100 atm, so the change in pressure ΔP is 99 atm.

So ΔG ≈ V * ΔP. That would be 1.0 dm³ * 99 atm. Now, converting that to joules: 1 dm³·atm = 101.325 J. So 99 * 101.325 ≈ let's calculate that.

99 * 100 is 9900, and 99 * 1.325 is about 131.175. Adding them, 9900 + 131.175 = 10,031.175 J. That's approximately 10,031 J, which is about 10.031 kJ. So the change in Gibbs energy is about +10 kJ, right? Because when pressure increases, if the volume is positive (since it's a liquid, V is positive), ΔG would be positive.

Wait, but wait. The formula ΔG ≈ VΔP is for processes where the volume change is small, which is true for liquids. So the sign would be positive because the pressure increases, and V is positive (since it's a liquid, volume is positive when pressure increases and it's compressed a little, but for a liquid, the change is negligible, but the formula still holds). So the ΔG is positive because pressure increases.

Looking back at the options, option I is +10 kJ. So the answer should be I.

Wait, but wait another thing. I'm assuming that the Gibbs energy change is calculated as VΔP, but I think the correct formula for the Gibbs free energy change at constant temperature when pressure changes is ΔG = VΔP, but actually, for a process at constant temperature, the Gibbs energy change is given by ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1) for an ideal gas, but that's when the volume changes. But since we're dealing with a liquid, where the volume doesn't change, the formula simplifies to ΔG ≈ VΔP. So that should be correct.

Alternatively, another approach: the Gibbs free energy change can be expressed as ΔG = VΔP when the volume doesn't change much, which is the case for liquids. So yeah, the calculation I did earlier should be correct, leading to approximately +10 kJ. So the answer should be option I.

The change in Gibbs energy for a liquid under pressure can be approximated using the formula ΔG ≈ VΔP, where V is the volume and ΔP is the change in pressure. Given that the volume of benzene is 1.0 dm³ and the pressure increases from 1.0 atm to 100 atm, the pressure change ΔP is 99 atm. Converting 1 dm³·atm to joules (1 dm³·atm ≈ 101.325 J), the total energy change is approximately 99 × 101.325 ≈ 10,031 J, or about 10.031 kJ. Since the pressure increases and the volume is positive, the change in Gibbs energy is positive. Among the options, the closest value is +10 kJ.
