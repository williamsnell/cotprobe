Okay, so I have this question about logical fallacies, and I need to figure out the correct answer. The question is about someone changing the meaning of a word or phrase in an argument. Let me think through each option to see which one fits.

First, let's recap what each fallacy is about.

A: Hypostatization. I think this is when someone treats an abstract concept as if it's a real, concrete thing. Like when people personify things, giving them human characteristics. That doesn't seem to fit the question, which is about changing word meanings.

B: Appeal to authority. That's when someone uses an authority figure's opinion to argue a point, even if the authority isn't an expert in the field. This isn't about changing meanings, so probably not B.

C: Red herring fallacy. This is when someone introduces irrelevant information to distract from the issue. The question is about changing word meanings, so C doesn't fit.

D: False cause fallacy. This happens when someone assumes that because two things happened together, one caused the other. Not related to word meanings, so D is out.

E: Straw man fallacy. This is when someone misrepresents an opponent's argument to make it easier to attack. It's about misrepresentation, but the question is specifically about changing word meanings, not just misrepresenting the argument. Maybe, but I'm not sure yet.

F: Special pleading. This is when someone applies different standards to themselves and others, often to avoid the consequences of a general rule. Doesn't seem related to word meanings.

G: Equivocation. Oh, this rings a bell. Equivocation is when someone uses a word with multiple meanings in a way that shifts the meaning during an argument. Like using "free" to mean both "without cost" and "free from obligations." That fits the question exactly.

H: Slippery slope fallacy. This is the idea that a small step will inevitably lead to a chain of events with negative consequences. Not related to word meanings, so H is out.

I: Ad hominem attack. This is attacking the person instead of the argument. For example, saying someone's argument is wrong because they're untrustworthy. Doesn't apply here.

J: Question begging epithets. These are emotionally charged words that assume what they're trying to prove. Like using "terrorism" in a way that pre-judges the issue. This is similar to shifting word meanings but more about using loaded terms to influence the argument. It's a bit tricky, but I think it's different from changing the meaning in the same argument.

So, the key here is that the person is changing the meaning of a word or phrase within the same argument. That's exactly what equivocation is. So the answer should be G.

The correct answer is G: Equivocation. This fallacy occurs when a word with multiple meanings is used in a way that shifts its meaning within the same argument, which is precisely what the question describes.

Answer: G
