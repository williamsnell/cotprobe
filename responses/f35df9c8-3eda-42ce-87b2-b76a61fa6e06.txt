Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about how the United States took possession of the Oregon Territory. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the passage provided is from John L. O'Sullivan's "The Great Nation of Futurity," written in 1839. It's pretty inspirational, talking about the future of America and divine principles. But the question is about the Oregon Territory, so I need to focus on that.

I remember that the Oregon Territory was a significant area in the Pacific Northwest. The US and Great Britain both had claims there. I think there was some tension, but I'm not exactly sure how it ended. I recall something about the boundary dispute being a point of conflict, but I'm not certain if it was resolved through war or some other means.

Looking at the options:

A: Annexed after a revolt by settlers. I don't think the US annexed Oregon by a settler revolt; that's more like Texas, where settlers declared independence. Oregon was under British control, so maybe not a revolt.

B: Bought from Native Americans. That doesn't sound right because I think the US often took territories through treaties or other means, not buying from Native Americans.

C: Divided after a vote. I'm not sure about a vote. There was a popular movement called "54-40 or fight," which was about the boundary, but I don't think a vote divided it between the US and Canada.

D: Settlers were first to arrive. Well, the US and British settlers both went there. The US didn't necessarily get it because they were first; it was more about diplomatic negotiations.

E: Claimed after exploration. Lewis and Clark explored the area, but that was earlier, and I don't think that's how they took possession. Possession usually requires more than just exploration.

F: Won from Mexico in a war. The Mexican-American War was later, and Mexico controlled California and parts south, not Oregon. So probably not F.

G: Inherited from Spain via Louisiana Purchase. The Louisiana Purchase was from France, not Spain, and it included land east of the Mississippi, not Oregon.

H: Great Britain ceded it as part of a treaty. This sounds more plausible. The US and Britain had overlapping claims, and they eventually agreed on a boundary through treaties. I think the Oregon Treaty of 1846 resolved it, where Britain ceded the southern part to the US.

I: Granted in a postwar treaty with France. France sold the Louisiana Territory, but Oregon was a separate issue.

J: Gift from Russia. I don't think Russia was involved in Oregon; they were more involved in Alaska.

So, putting it together, the most likely answer is H: Great Britain ceded it to the United States as part of a negotiated treaty. Specifically, the Treaty of Oregon in 1846 where Britain agreed to let the US have the territory south of the 49th parallel.

The United States took possession of the Oregon Territory through a negotiated treaty with Great Britain, specifically the Treaty of Oregon in 1846, where Britain ceded the territory south of the 49th parallel to the United States.
