Okay, so I have this chemistry question here about ions and their electronic configurations. The question is asking which of the given ions have a rare gas electronic configuration. The options are a) Ca²+, b) In⁺, c) Ga³+, d) Sc³+, and e) Se²−. I need to figure out which of these ions have the same electron structure as a noble gas.

First, I should remember what a rare gas electronic configuration means. Noble gases have stable electron configurations, usually with a full outer shell. For ions, this means that after losing or gaining electrons, their electron configuration matches that of a noble gas.

I think I'll start by figuring out the electron configurations for each ion.

Let's take each ion one by one.

a) Ca²+:
Calcium has an atomic number of 20. Its electron configuration is [Ar] 4s². When it loses two electrons to become Ca²+, it'll lose the 4s electrons. So, Ca²+ should have the configuration of Ar, which is [Ne], wait, no. Wait, Ar is atomic number 18. So Ca²+ would have 20 - 2 = 18 electrons. Yes, so [Ar], which is a noble gas. So Ca²+ is a noble gas ion. Got it.

b) In⁺:
Indium has an atomic number of 49. Indium is in group 13, so its neutral configuration is [Kr] 5s² 4d¹⁰ 5p¹. When it loses one electron to become In⁺, it'll lose the 5p electron. So the configuration becomes [Kr] 5s² 4d¹⁰. Wait, what's the noble gas after Kr? Oh, Kr is a noble gas, so In⁺ would have the same configuration as Kr. Because [Kr] is the configuration, so that's a noble gas. So In⁺ is a noble gas ion.

c) Ga³+:
Gallium has an atomic number of 31. Its neutral configuration is [Ar] 3d¹⁰ 4s² 4p¹. When it loses three electrons to become Ga³+, it'll lose the 4p and 4s electrons, and perhaps one from 3d? Wait, metals usually lose the outermost electrons first. So Ga³+ would lose the 4s and 4p electrons, so 4s² 4p¹ → losing 3 electrons would leave 4s⁰ 4p⁰. So the configuration would be [Ar] 3d¹⁰. Wait, but 3d¹⁰ is the configuration for ions like Al³+ (which is [Ne] 3s² 3p⁶ → but wait, Al is group 13, so Al³+ is Ne configuration. Hmm, but Ga is in group 13, so Ga³+ would have a configuration similar to Ar, but wait, let me think again.

Wait, Ga has atomic number 31. Neutral Ga is [Ar] 3d¹⁰ 4s² 4p¹. So when Ga loses 3 electrons, it goes from 31 e⁻ to 31-3=28 e⁻. So 28 is the atomic number of nickel (Ni), but wait, that's not a noble gas. Oh wait, but maybe I should think of the electron configuration. So 28 electrons would be [Ar] 3d^8 4s²? Because after losing three electrons, 4s² and 4p¹ are lost, so 4s² 4p¹ → 3 electrons, so 3d¹⁰ remains? Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, the noble gas before Ga is Ar with 18 electrons. So if Ga³+ has 31-3=28 electrons, that's two more than Ar (18). So 28 is Ni's atomic number, but Ni isn't a noble gas. So Ga³+ doesn't have a noble gas configuration. Alternatively, maybe it's [Ar] 3d¹⁰, which would be 18 + 10 = 28 electrons. Oh wait, but 3d¹⁰ would mean 10 electrons in d, so 18 (Ar) +10 =28. So Ga³+ would have [Ar] 3d¹⁰, which is the configuration for Zn²+ (which is a d-block ion, but not a noble gas). Wait, but noble gases don't have d electrons. So Ga³+ would have d electrons, which means it's not a noble gas configuration. So Ga³+ does not have a rare gas configuration.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. So, Ga is in group 13. Neutral Ga has 31 electrons. When it loses 3 electrons, it's 31-3=28. So 28 electrons.

The noble gas with 18 electrons is Ar. Next is Kr at 36. So 28 is between Ar and Kr. So the configuration would be [Ar] 3d¹⁰ 4s²? Because 18 +10 + 2 =30? Wait, that's 30 electrons. Wait, no. Let me think. 28 electrons would be:

[Ar] (18) + 3d^10 (10) = 28. So the configuration is [Ar] 3d¹⁰. But that's not a noble gas because noble gases have 8 electrons in their outer shell (except He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, etc.), but in this case, the d shell is filled, but d is not the outer shell for ions. Wait, for ions, the outermost shell is the valence shell. So if it's 3d¹⁰, that's a filled d subshell, but I'm not sure if that's considered a noble gas configuration. Because noble gases have their outer shells filled, which are s and p. So perhaps Ga³+ doesn't have a noble gas configuration.

Hmm, maybe I should look for ions that have a complete p subshell, like [Ne], [Ar], [Kr], etc.

Wait, another approach: the noble gases have electron configurations ending with s²p⁶. So let's see each ion:

a) Ca²+: Z=20 → 20-2=18 → [Ar] → yes, noble gas.

b) In⁺: Z=49 → 49-1=48. Let's see, the noble gas before 48 is Kr (36), then comes Xe (54). So 48 is between Kr and Xe. So In⁺ has 48 electrons. Let me see: [Kr] 4d¹⁰ 5s² 5p⁶? Wait, no, because 36 + (4d^10 is 10, 5s² 5p^6 is 8) → 36+18=54, which is Xe. But In has 49 electrons, so In⁺ is 48. So the configuration would be [Kr] 4d¹⁰ 5s² 5p⁶? Wait, that's 36+10+8=54, which is Xe. But In has Z=49, so In⁺ is 48. So 48 electrons would be [Kr] 4d^8 5s² 5p^6? Because 36 + (4d^8) + (5s² 5p^6)= 36+8+8=52? No, wait, 36 + (10 from 4d¹⁰?), but I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps In⁺ is [Kr] 4d^10 5s² 5p^1 → no, wait, In is neutral at [Kr] 5s² 4d^10 5p¹. So In⁺ would lose the 5p¹, leaving [Kr] 4d¹⁰ 5s². Wait, that's 36 + 10 + 2 =48. So 48 electrons. So the configuration would be [Kr] 4d¹⁰ 5s², which is not a noble gas configuration because the last shell isn't filled. Alternatively, perhaps the 5s² is the valence shell, but d is not part of the outermost shell. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong and In⁺ doesn't have a noble gas configuration. Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for other ways.

Wait, another approach: noble gases have complete p subshells. So for an ion to have a noble gas configuration, after losing or gaining electrons, its outermost shell should be filled, and the previous shell should be a noble gas.

So for Ca²+ (Z=20), losing 2 electrons gives 18, which is Ar, a noble gas. So that's correct.

In⁺: Z=49, losing 1 electron gives 48. Let's see, 48 - 36 (Kr) is 12. So 12 electrons in 5s and 5p. So 5s² 5p^10? Because 2+10=12. Wait, but 5p^10 is possible. So the configuration would be [Kr] 5s² 5p^10, which would make it a noble gas because p^10 is equivalent to p^8 in some contexts? Wait, no, noble gases have p^6. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up things. Let me think: for the fifth period, the noble gas is Xe, which is [Kr] 4d^10 5s² 5p^6. So if In⁺ has [Kr] 4d^10 5s² 5p^10, that would be 36 +10 +2 +10=58, which is beyond Xe (which is 54). So that can't be right. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, In⁺ would have [Kr] 5s² 4d^10, which is 36 + 10 + 2 =48. So that's 48 electrons. Now, the next noble gas after Kr is Xe (54), so 48 is not a noble gas. So perhaps In⁺ doesn't have a noble gas configuration. Wait, but earlier I thought it did. I'm getting confused here.

Wait, maybe I should check another way. Let me think about the electron configurations of these ions.

- Ca²+: as I said, 18 electrons → [Ar], noble gas.

- In⁺: 49-1=48 electrons. The noble gas with 48 would be... Wait, Kr is 36, Xe is 54. So 48 is in between. So In⁺ has an electron configuration of [Kr] 5s² 4d¹⁰. Wait, but that's not a noble gas. Because noble gases have their outermost shell filled with p^6. So unless In⁺ has [Kr] 5s² 5p^6, which would be 36+2+6=44, which is 44, but In is 49, so 49-1=48. So 48 electrons. So 36 (Kr) + 12 more. 12 can be 5s² 5p^10, but p^10 isn't possible because p can hold up to 6 electrons. Wait, that's not possible. So maybe In⁺ doesn't have a noble gas configuration. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, maybe I should check the actual ions. I remember that some ions like Cu²+ and Zn²+ have d^8 and d^10 configurations, respectively. But those aren't noble gases. Noble gas ions would have complete p shells.

Wait, another approach: for an ion to have a noble gas configuration, it must have an electron count equal to a noble gas. So let's count each ion's electrons.

a) Ca²+: 20-2=18 → Ar (18), so yes.

b) In⁺: 49-1=48 → which is between Kr (36) and Xe (54). 48 isn't a noble gas number, so no.

c) Ga³+: 31-3=28 → which is Ni's atomic number, not noble.

d) Sc³+: Sc has Z=21. Sc³+ would be 21-3=18 → Ar, so yes.

e) Se²−: Se has Z=34. Gaining 2 electrons makes it 36. 36 is Kr, a noble gas. So yes.

Wait, so from this, Ca²+ (18), Sc³+ (18), and Se²− (36) would have noble gas configurations. Let me check each.

So the ions with rare gas configurations are a) Ca²+, d) Sc³+, and e) Se²−. Let me look at the options.

Options:

A: In^+, Sc^3+ and Se^2- → Sc and Se are correct, but In+ may not be.

B: Ca²+, Ga³+ and In³+ → only Ca correct, others not.

C: Ca²+, Sc³+ and Se²− → yes, all correct.

D: In³+, Ga³+ and Se²− → no.

E: Ca²+, In+ and Se²− → In+ may not be correct.

F: In+, Ga³+ and Sc³+ → Sc is correct, others not.

G: Ga³+, In+ and Ca²+ → Ga and In+ not correct.

H: Ca²+, In³+ and Ga³+ → no.

I: In³+, Ca²+ and Sc³+ → All correct except In³+?

Wait, In³+ would have Z=49-3=46. 46 is Polonium's atomic number, which is not a noble gas. So In³+ isn't correct.

J: Sc³+, Se²− and Ga³+ → only Sc and Se correct.

So the correct ions are a, d, e: Ca²+, Sc³+, Se²−.

Looking back at the options, option C is "Ca²+, Sc³+ and Se²−", which matches. So the answer should be option C.

To determine which ions possess a rare gas electronic configuration, we analyze the electron configurations of each ion:

1. **Ca²⁺ (Calcium ion)**:  
   Calcium has an atomic number of 20, with an electron configuration of [Ar] 4s². Losing two electrons (Ca²⁺) leaves it with 18 electrons, corresponding to the noble gas Argon ([Ar]).  
   **Conclusion**: Ca²⁺ has a rare gas configuration.

2. **In⁺ (Indium ion)**:  
   Indium has an atomic number of 49, with an electron configuration of [Kr] 5s² 4d¹⁰ 5p¹. Losing one electron (In⁺) leaves it with 48 electrons. The nearest noble gas is Krypton ([Kr] with 36 electrons), and the next noble gas is Xenon ([Xe] with 54 electrons). Since 48 electrons do not match a noble gas configuration, In⁺ does not have a rare gas configuration.  
   **Conclusion**: In⁺ does not have a rare gas configuration.

3. **Ga³⁺ (Gallium ion)**:  
   Gallium has an atomic number of 31, with an electron configuration of [Ar] 3d¹⁰ 4s² 4p¹. Losing three electrons (Ga³⁺) leaves it with 28 electrons. This corresponds to Nickel (Ni), not a noble gas.  
   **Conclusion**: Ga³⁺ does not have a rare gas configuration.

4. **Sc³⁺ (Scandium ion)**:  
   Scandium has an atomic number of 21, with an electron configuration of [Ar] 3d¹ 4s². Losing three electrons (Sc³⁺) leaves it with 18 electrons, corresponding to the noble gas Argon ([Ar]).  
   **Conclusion**: Sc³⁺ has a rare gas configuration.

5. **Se²⁻ (Selenium ion)**:  
   Selenium has an atomic number of 34, with an electron configuration of [Ar] 3d¹⁰ 4s² 4p⁴. Gaining two electrons (Se²⁻) leaves it with 36 electrons, corresponding to the noble gas Xenon ([Xe]).  
   **Conclusion**: Se²⁻ has a rare gas configuration.

From this analysis, the ions with rare gas electronic configurations are **Ca²⁺, Sc³⁺, and Se²⁻**. Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**C: Ca²⁺, Sc³⁺, and Se²⁻**
