The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A teenage male was on trial on charges of illegally entering an owner's property and stealing a car. The witness can only confirm for the prosecution that a car was stolen, the model and type of car, and that it was missing from the property on a certain date. The defense asks witness "isn't it possible that my client did not steal the car, that someone else did it, and that the police are lying about the charges against him? The prosecution objected to the question. Will the court likely sustain the objection?

Options:

A: No, as it is essential for the defense to create reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury.
B: Yes, because the question is not directly related to the charges against the defendant.
C: Yes, because this is an objectionable question based on pure speculation.
D: No, because the defense is merely suggesting a possibility, not stating it as fact.
E: No, because the defense has the right to question every aspect of the prosecution's case.
F: Yes, because it is not permissible to question the credibility of the police without substantial supporting evidence.
G: No, questioning about the possibility of other perpetrators, or about police misconduct, is always permissible.
H: No, because the witness may know something that he is not revealing and for that reason, a cross-examiner is given wide latitude in questioning.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about a criminal trial. Let me read through the question carefully.

So, the scenario is about a teenage male on trial for illegally entering someone's property and stealing a car. The prosecution's witness can only confirm that a car was stolen, its model and type, and that it was missing on a certain date. The defense asks the witness a question suggesting that maybe the defendant didn't steal the car and that someone else did it, possibly implying the police are lying. The prosecution objects, and we're supposed to determine if the court will sustain that objection.

I remember that in criminal trials, the defense's role is to create reasonable doubt. They can do this by introducing evidence or questioning that suggests other possibilities. So, the defense is trying to imply that there's someone else who could have done it, which is a common tactic to cast doubt on the prosecution's case.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the court will not sustain the objection because it's essential for the defense to create reasonable doubt. That makes sense because the defense's job is to challenge the prosecution's case and suggest other possibilities.

Option B says the court will sustain the objection because the question isn't directly related. But I think the question is related because it's about whether the defendant did it or someone else, which goes to the heart of the case.

Option C says the objection is based on pure speculation. While the defense is suggesting an alternative theory, it's not pure speculation if it's a possibility. The defense doesn't need to prove it, just raise the possibility.

Option D says the court won't sustain the objection because the defense is suggesting a possibility, not stating fact. This seems correct because the defense can ask questions that imply possibilities without presenting facts.

Option E says the defense can question every aspect. That's a broad statement, but I think it's more about whether the specific question is proper, not an absolute right.

Option F says questioning about police credibility isn't permissible without evidence. But I think the defense can imply police might be lying if it's relevant, though they can't accuse them without basis. Here, the defense is suggesting someone else did it, which might touch on police possibly not investigating others.

Option G says such questioning is always permissible. That might be too broad. I think there are limits, but in many cases, it's allowed.

Option H says the court won't sustain because cross-examination is given wide latitude. That seems correct because cross-examination allows for probing into the witness's knowledge and suggesting other possibilities.

So, the defense is asking a question that suggests an alternative scenario, which is allowed to create reasonable doubt. The prosecution's objection would likely be overruled because the defense is within their rights to do so. 

Therefore, the correct answer would be D or H. But D says the defense is merely suggesting a possibility, not stating it as fact, which is correct. H is also possible because cross-examination allows wide latitude. But I think D is more precise because it directly addresses the nature of the question as a suggestion, not a fact.

The defense is permitted to ask questions that suggest alternative possibilities to create reasonable doubt. The witness's testimony is limited, so the defense is within their rights to question the circumstances. The court is likely to allow this line of questioning as it is a legitimate tactic in cross-examination.

Answer: D
