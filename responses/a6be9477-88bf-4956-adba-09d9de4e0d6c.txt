Okay, so I've got this question about how to study the human norovirus when it can't be cultured in cell cultures. Hmm, let me think through this. I know noroviruses are a bit tricky because they're hard to grow in the lab. I remember reading that they require specific conditions, maybe certain cell types or maybe even interactions with the gut that aren't easily replicated.

The question is asking for the best way to study it if cell culture isn't an option. Let's look at the options. Option A is volunteer studies. That would mean infecting people on purpose, which sounds risky and probably not the best approach, especially for a virus that can cause severe illness. So maybe A is not the best choice.

Option B is animal studies using non-human primates. I think some viruses are tested in monkeys or other animals. But wait, noroviruses are species-specific, right? So non-human primates might not be susceptible. I'm not sure about this one. It might not be effective.

Option C is computer simulations. That's an interesting idea. If you can model the virus computationally, you can study its behavior without handling it physically. But I'm not sure how detailed or accurate these models are. It might not give the whole picture, especially for understanding how the virus interacts with the host.

Option D is studying the virus's effect on plant cells. That seems unrelated. Noroviruses don't infect plants, so this probably isn't useful. I can rule this out.

Option E is using replicon systems in cells. I'm a bit fuzzy on what replicon systems are. From what I remember, replicons are RNA molecules that can replicate without integrating into the genome. So maybe this allows the virus to replicate in certain cell lines that don't support full replication. This might be a way to study parts of the virus, like its replication mechanisms, without the whole virus.

Option F is animal models, which is a bit vague. It could mean using mice or other animals. But again, if the virus doesn't infect them, this might not work. However, some animal models are used for norovirus research, perhaps with engineered strains.

Option G is isolating the virus in a lab. Wait, the question says it can't be cultured, so if you can't culture it, how do you isolate it? Maybe this refers to isolating from samples, but without culture, studying it would be limited. I'm not sure if this is feasible.

Option H is using non-replicon systems in cells. I'm not too clear on this. Non-replicon systems might not allow replication, which could limit the study. So maybe this isn't as useful as replicon systems for studying replication.

Option I is deductions from the three human ORFs of the virus genome. ORFs are open reading frames. Norovirus has three main ORFs: ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3. If you can study these genes and their proteins, you might infer a lot about the virus's structure and function. But this is more of an indirect method, relying on genetic information rather than live virus.

So thinking back, the question is about the best way to study the virus when it can't be cultured. So cell culture isn't an option. Replicon systems (E) might allow parts of the virus to be studied in a controlled environment, perhaps. Alternatively, using volunteer studies (A) is risky, and animal models (F) might not work if the virus doesn't infect them. Computer models (C) are possible but perhaps not as comprehensive.

Wait, another thought: some viruses can be studied using replicon particles, which are virus-like particles that can infect cells but don't replicate. Maybe this allows for some studies on the structural aspects or immune response without the risk of full infection. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, looking at the options, maybe the best way is to use volunteer studies, but that's risky. Or maybe the answer is using replicon systems. Or perhaps the answer is I, looking at the genome's ORFs to understand the virus's components.

Wait, the question says "best" way. So which method is most effective when you can't culture the virus? If you can't grow it in cells, you might use animal models that are permissive, but if not, then other methods.

I think the answer might be E: In cells using replicon systems. Because replicon systems allow parts of the virus to be expressed and studied in a controlled setting, even if the virus can't replicate fully. Alternatively, option I could be about genetic studies, but that's more about understanding the genome rather than studying the live virus.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Another angle: the question is about how to study the virus when it can't be cultured. So methods that don't require live virus growth. So perhaps using computer simulations (C), but I'm not sure. Or maybe using the virus's genome data (I), but that's more about bioinformatics.

But the options suggest practical methods. So, perhaps the answer is E: using replicon systems. Or maybe F: animal models, assuming that some animal models are used for norovirus, even if they're not perfect.

Wait, I think I've heard that noroviruses can be studied using replicon systems in cell culture. So even though they can't be fully cultured, you can have parts of the virus replicated in cells, allowing for some studies on replication, structure, etc.

So the best answer would be E: In cells using replicon systems.

The question asks for the best way to study the human norovirus when it cannot be cultured in cell cultures. Noroviruses are challenging to study due to their difficulty in cultivation, requiring specific conditions that are hard to replicate in a lab. 

- **Option A (Volunteer studies)**: This involves infecting humans intentionally, which is risky and unethical, especially for a virus that can cause severe illness. Thus, this is not the best choice.  
- **Option B (Animal studies using non-human primates)**: While animal models are sometimes used in virology, noroviruses are species-specific and may not infect non-human primates effectively, making this approach less reliable.  
- **Option C (Computer simulation models)**: Computational models can provide insights into viral behavior, but they may lack the detail and accuracy needed to fully understand the virus's interactions with its host.  
- **Option D (Studying the virus's effect on plant cells)**: Noroviruses do not infect plants, so this option is irrelevant.  
- **Option E (In cells using replicon systems)**: Replicon systems allow parts of the virus to be expressed and studied in a controlled cell environment, even if the virus cannot replicate fully. This method enables researchers to investigate aspects like replication mechanisms without culturing the entire virus.  
- **Option F (Animal models)**: While animal models can be useful, noroviruses may not infect certain animals, limiting their effectiveness.  
- **Option G (Isolating the virus in a laboratory setting)**: If the virus cannot be cultured, isolating it would be challenging and may not provide sufficient material for study.  
- **Option H (In cells using non-replicon systems)**: Non-replicon systems may not support replication, limiting their utility for studying the virus.  
- **Option I (Deductions from the 3 human ORFs of the virus genome)**: Analyzing the virus's genome can provide insights into its structure and function, but this is an indirect method and does not involve studying the live virus.  

Considering the options, **Option E (In cells using replicon systems)** stands out as the best method. Replicon systems allow parts of the virus to be studied in a controlled setting, making it possible to investigate aspects like replication and structure without requiring full virus cultivation.
