Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem about guinea pigs and their coat color. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats. Black is dominant over white. The result was that three quarters of the offspring had black coats, and one quarter had white. I need to figure out the genotypes of the parents from the options given.

Hmm, I remember that in genetics, when you have a dominant trait, like black coat here, the possible genotypes are either homozygous dominant (like BB) or heterozygous (Bb). The recessive trait, white coat, can only be expressed if the genotype is homozygous recessive (bb).

Since both parents have black coats, their possible genotypes could be BB or Bb. If both were BB, all their offspring should be BB, right? Because BB × BB would only produce BB offspring, meaning all black coats. But in the question, 25% are white, so that can't be the case. So the parents can't both be BB.

Wait, let's think. If one parent is BB and the other is Bb, what happens? Let's do a quick Punnett square. BB can only give B gametes. Bb can give B or b. So the possible offspring would be BB (50%) and Bb (50%). Both would have black coats because B is dominant. So that's not matching the question either, since the question has some white offspring.

So that can't be right. Then maybe one parent is Bb and the other is bb? Wait, but the parents are both black, so they can't be bb because bb is white. Oh right, so both parents have to be black, so their possible genotypes are BB or Bb.

Wait, maybe both parents are Bb. So let's do that cross. Bb × Bb. The Punnett square would be:

B | b
B | b
-------
BB | Bb
Bb | bb

So the possible genotypes would be BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). Since BB and Bb are black, that's 75% black, and 25% white. Oh, that matches the question exactly. So the parents were both Bb.

Looking at the options, option A is Bb × Bb. That seems to fit.

Let me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not missing anything. Option B says BB × BB and Bb × bb. Well, BB × BB would produce all BB, which doesn't match. Bb × bb would produce all Bb and bb? Wait, no, because if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the cross would be Bb × bb. So gametes from Bb are B and b, and from bb are all b. So the offspring would be Bb (50%) and bb (50%). So 50% black and 50% white. But the question has 75% black, so that's not matching either.

Option E is bb × BB. Both parents can't be bb because they're black, so E is out. Option F is Bb × bb. Again, one parent is white, which can't be because both are black. So F is incorrect.

Option G is Bb × BB. Let me think about that cross. BB can only give B, and Bb gives B or b. So the offspring would be BB (50%) and Bb (50%). Both black. So no white offspring. Doesn't match.

Option H is BB × Bb. Same as G. Both parents would produce only BB and Bb, all black. So that's not it.

Option I is BB × bb. Wait, both can't be bb because they're black. So I is wrong.

Option J is BB × BB, which would only produce BB, all black, which doesn't match the 25% white.

So the only option that fits is A: Bb × Bb.

The question involves determining the genotypes of two guinea pigs with black coats, where black is dominant over white. The cross results in 75% black-coated and 25% white-coated offspring. Since black is dominant, the parents must have genotypes that can produce white (recessive) offspring. Both parents are black, so their possible genotypes are either BB (homozygous dominant) or Bb (heterozygous). A cross between two Bb individuals (Bb × Bb) produces the following Punnett square:

|   | B | b |
|---|---|---|
| B | BB | Bb |
| b | Bb | bb |

This results in 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb offspring. Since BB and Bb express the dominant black coat, 75% of the offspring are black, and 25% (bb) are white. This matches the given data. Other options, such as BB × BB or Bb × bb, do not produce the required 75:25 ratio. Therefore, the parents were most likely Bb × Bb.
