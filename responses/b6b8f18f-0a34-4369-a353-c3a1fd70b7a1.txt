Okay, so I've got this problem about a rectangular broad-crested weir, and I need to find the discharge. Hmm, let's see. I remember from my hydraulics class that weirs are used to measure flow rates, and there's a specific formula for that.

The problem says the weir is 30 feet long, and the discharge coefficient is 0.7. The upstream water level is 2 feet over the crest. Wait, I think the formula for discharge (Q) over a rectangular weir is something like Q = Cd * L * (2g)^0.5 * H^(3/2), where Cd is the discharge coefficient, L is the length, and H is the height of the water above the crest. Oh right, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. I think g is about 32.2 ft/s².

So plugging in the numbers: Cd is 0.7, L is 30 ft, H is 2 ft. Let's write that out.

Q = 0.7 * 30 * sqrt(2*32.2) * (2)^(3/2)

Wait, I need to compute each part step by step. First, sqrt(2*32.2). Let's calculate that. 2*32.2 is 64.4. The square root of 64.4 is approximately 8.025. Hmm, that seems right because sqrt(64) is 8, and 64.4 is a bit more, so about 8.025.

Next, H is 2 ft, and we're raising that to the 3/2 power. 2^(3/2) is the same as sqrt(2^3), which is sqrt(8). Sqrt(8) is approximately 2.828.

Now, putting it all together. So 0.7 multiplied by 30 is 21. Then, 21 multiplied by 8.025 (from the sqrt part) gives... let me calculate that. 21 * 8 is 168, and 21 * 0.025 is 0.525, so total is 168.525. Then, multiply that by 2.828 from the H^(3/2) term.

So 168.525 * 2.828. Let me break that down. 168 * 2.828 is approximately, let's see, 160*2.828=452.48, and 8*2.828≈22.624, so total around 475.104. Then the 0.525 * 2.828 is about 1.485. Adding that gives 475.104 + 1.485 ≈ 476.589 cfs.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I should use more precise numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact formula. The formula is Q = Cd * L * sqrt(2g) * H^(3/2). Let's compute each part with more precision.

Compute sqrt(2g): 2*32.2 =64.4. sqrt(64.4) = 8.02499, let's say 8.025.

H^(3/2) for H=2: 2^(1.5) = 2 * sqrt(2) ≈ 2.828427.

So Q = 0.7 * 30 * 8.025 * 2.828427.

Compute step by step:

0.7 * 30 = 21.

21 * 8.025 = 21 *8 + 21*0.025 = 168 + 0.525 = 168.525.

168.525 * 2.828427. Let's compute 168 * 2.828427 first.

168 *2 = 336.

168 *0.828427 ≈ let's see, 168 *0.8=134.4, 168*0.028427≈4.766. So total ≈ 134.4 +4.766=139.166. So 336 +139.166=475.166.

Now, the 0.525 part: 0.525 *2.828427 ≈1.485.

Adding that to 475.166 gives approximately 476.651 cfs.

Looking at the options, B is 476 cfs, which would be the closest. So the answer should be option B.

The discharge over the rectangular broad-crested weir is calculated using the formula \( Q = C_d \cdot L \cdot \sqrt{2g} \cdot H^{3/2} \). Substituting the given values \( C_d = 0.7 \), \( L = 30 \, \text{ft} \), \( H = 2 \, \text{ft} \), and \( g = 32.2 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \), the discharge is approximately \( 476 \, \text{cfs} \).
