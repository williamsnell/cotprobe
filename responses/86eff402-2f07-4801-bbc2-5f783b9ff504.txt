Okay, so I've got this question about US presidents, and I'm trying to figure out who was the first one to resign. Let's see, the options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I'll list out the options to make it clearer:

A: Andrew Jackson
B: George Washington
C: Abraham Lincoln
D: Franklin D. Roosevelt
E: George W. Bush
F: Thomas Jefferson
G: Martin Van Buren
H: Richard Nixon
I: John F. Kennedy
J: Andrew Johnson

I remember that Richard Nixon resigned, that's for sure. He was the 37th president and resigned in 1974 due to the Watergate scandal. But was he the first one? I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the others.

Andrew Jackson (A) was the 7th president and served in the early 1800s. I don't recall him resigning; he served two terms and died in office, but I don't think he resigned. George Washington (B) was the first president, and he set the precedent by stepping down after two terms, but that's more of a peaceful transition rather than resigning while in office. He didn't resign; he just didn't run for a third term.

Abraham Lincoln (C) was the 16th president and was assassinated, so he didn't resign. Franklin D. Roosevelt (D) was president during the Great Depression and WWII, and he served four terms, but he died in office, not resigning. George W. Bush (E) is the 43rd president, and I don't think he resigned; he served two terms. Thomas Jefferson (F) was the 3rd president and served two terms, dying later, but no resignation. Martin Van Buren (G) was the 8th president, but again, I don't think he resigned.

John F. Kennedy (I) was the 35th president, but he was assassinated, so he didn't resign. Andrew Johnson (J) was the 17th president, succeeding Lincoln. He was impeached but not removed; he completed his term. So, he didn't resign either.

So, going back, the first president to resign would be Richard Nixon. Before him, I don't think any other president had resigned. Nixon was the first, so the answer should be H.
