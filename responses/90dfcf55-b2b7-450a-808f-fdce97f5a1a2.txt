Question:

A gardener sued a homeowner for breach of contract. The gardener claims that the homeowner hired him to perform landscape work at his home. After performing the gardening services, the homeowner paid him $100. The gardener, who speaks only English, contends that the homeowner, who speaks only Japanese, originally agreed to pay him $200 for the work. When the parties entered into their agreement, the gardener was accompanied by his friend, who is now deceased, who spoke both English and Japanese. This jurisdiction has a typical Dead Man's Statute in effect. At trial, the gardener now seeks to testify to the terms of his agreement with the homeowner as communicated to him by his friend. Upon objection by the homeowner's attorney, the gardener's proposed testimony is

Options:

A: inadmissible, as it is hearsay and not an exception under the Dead Man's Statute.
B: inadmissible, because the gardener did not have a translator present during the agreement.
C: admissible, as it is relevant to the case and not excluded by the Dead Man's Statute.
D: admissible as non-hearsay to corroborate evidence of a verbal act.
E: inadmissible, because the friend was not an official translator.
F: admissible, because it is a statement of a deceased person.
G: admissible as an admission by a party-opponent.
H: inadmissible, unless it is established that the gardener accepted the friend as the homeowner's agent in communicating the terms of the contract.
I: admissible, as it is a statement made during the course of employment.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me start by breaking down the scenario and the relevant points.

So, the gardener sued the homeowner for breach of contract. The gardener says he was hired to do landscape work, and after doing the work, the homeowner paid him $100. But the gardener claims they agreed on $200. Now, the gardener only speaks English, and the homeowner only speaks Japanese. When they made the agreement, the gardener had a friend with him who was bilingual—English and Japanese. But this friend is now deceased.

The jurisdiction has a Dead Man's Statute. I remember that Dead Man's Statutes typically make statements of a deceased person inadmissible unless they fall under certain exceptions. These statutes are often designed to prevent hearsay from deceased individuals from being admitted, as it can be difficult to challenge the statements without the person being able to testify.

The question is about the gardener's proposed testimony. He wants to testify about the terms of the agreement as communicated by his friend. The homeowner's attorney is objecting. So, I need to determine if this testimony is admissible.

Let's consider the hearsay issue first. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Here, the gardener is trying to recount what his friend told him about the agreement. That sounds like hearsay because the statement is being offered to prove that the agreement was for $200, not just to show that the friend made a statement.

Now, Dead Man's Statutes usually exclude hearsay statements from deceased individuals unless there's an exception. So, if the friend's statement is being offered through the gardener, it might be inadmissible unless it fits an exception.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's inadmissible as hearsay and not an exception under the Dead Man's Statute. That seems plausible because the friend is deceased, and unless there's an exception, the statement would be excluded.

Option B is about not having a translator present, but the issue isn't about needing a translator; it's about hearsay. So B might not be correct.

Option C suggests it's admissible as relevant and not excluded by the statute. But the Dead Man's Statute does exclude such statements unless an exception applies, so C might be incorrect.

Option D says it's admissible as non-hearsay to corroborate a verbal act. I'm not sure about this. If it's non-hearsay, it must not be offered for the truth. Maybe it's offered to show that the gardener relied on the friend's communication, but that might not apply here. I'm not convinced D is correct.

Option E says it's inadmissible because the friend wasn't an official translator. But the statute doesn't require official status; it's about the hearsay statement. So E might not be the right reason.

Option F claims admissibility because it's a statement of a deceased person. But that's actually the issue—the Dead Man's Statute excludes such statements, so F is likely incorrect.

Option G suggests it's an admission by a party-opponent. Admissions are statements by a party's agent or employee and are exceptions to hearsay. But here, the friend was the gardener's friend, not the homeowner's agent. So the homeowner wouldn't be bound by the friend's statements unless the friend was acting as their agent, which isn't indicated here. So G might not apply.

Option H says it's inadmissible unless the gardener accepted the friend as the homeowner's agent. That makes sense because if the friend was acting as the homeowner's agent, then the statement would be an admission. But the gardener's friend was there with the gardener, not the homeowner. So unless the gardener can show the friend was the homeowner's agent, which doesn't seem to be the case, H might be the correct reason for inadmissibility.

Option I suggests it's admissible as a statement during employment. But the friend wasn't employed by either party here; he was just a bilingual friend. So I don't think I applies.

So, going back, the main issue is hearsay and the Dead Man's Statute. The friend is deceased, so his statements are inadmissible unless an exception applies. The possible exceptions might include admissions by a party-opponent, but that would require the friend to be acting within the scope of his agency for the homeowner, which doesn't seem to be the case here. Alternatively, if the friend was the gardener's agent, but the gardener is the one suing, so that's not relevant.

Wait, but the Dead Man's Statute might not apply if the statement is an admission by a party-opponent. Let me think. Admissions are exceptions to hearsay. So if the friend was the homeowner's agent, then the statement would be an admission. But the friend was with the gardener, not the homeowner. So the homeowner's attorney would likely argue that the friend wasn't acting as the homeowner's agent, so the statement isn't an admission.

Alternatively, if the friend was acting as the gardener's translator, perhaps it's not hearsay because it's being offered to show that the gardener communicated the terms, not that the terms were agreed upon. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another angle: the statement is being offered to prove the terms of the contract. If the friend was the one who relayed the terms between the gardener (who speaks English) and the homeowner (who speaks Japanese), then the friend's statement could be considered as a statement by the homeowner through his agent (the friend). But I think in that case, the friend would need to be the homeowner's agent for the statement to be an admission. But the fact that the friend was with the gardener might mean he was acting more as the gardener's translator, not the homeowner's agent.

So, without the friend being the homeowner's agent, the statement isn't an admission. Therefore, it's inadmissible hearsay under the Dead Man's Statute unless another exception applies. So the correct answer would be A or H.

Looking at the options, H says it's inadmissible unless the gardener accepted the friend as the homeowner's agent. That seems accurate because if the gardener considered the friend as the homeowner's agent, then the friend's statements would be admissions. But the problem doesn't indicate that; the friend was the gardener's friend, not the homeowner's. So the gardener probably didn't accept him as the homeowner's agent.

Therefore, the testimony is hearsay and not an exception under the Dead Man's Statute. So the answer is A.
</think>

The gardener's proposed testimony about the terms of the agreement, as communicated by his deceased friend, is inadmissible. The friend's statement is hearsay, and the Dead Man's Statute excludes such statements unless an exception applies. The friend was not acting as the homeowner's agent, and there is no indication that the gardener accepted him as such. Without an applicable exception, the testimony cannot be admitted.
