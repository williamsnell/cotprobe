Okay, so I've got this biology question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. The question is about an allele that's masked, and I have to choose the right term from the options given. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I remember that in genetics, an allele is a variant of a gene. Now, when an allele is "masked," that usually means it's not being expressed. But wait, why wouldn't an allele be expressed? I think it has something to do with dominance. Oh right, dominant and recessive alleles.

So, in a diploid organism, each gene has two alleles, one from each parent. If one allele is dominant, it will mask or hide the expression of the recessive allele. For example, if someone has the genotype Aa, the dominant allele A will show the trait, and the recessive a won't be visible. So the recessive allele is masked by the dominant one.

Looking at the options:

A: reclusive – that means shy or retiring, not really related to genetics terms.

B: residual – leftover or remaining, doesn't fit here.

C: resistant – that's more about being able to withstand something, like antibiotic resistance.

D: reductive – relating to reduction, not sure about this one.

E: reactive – responding to something, not directly related.

F: reflective – reflecting light or thoughts, no.

G: redundant – unnecessary, not quite right.

H: recessive – this fits because the recessive allele is masked by the dominant one.

I: refractive – bending light, not relevant.

J: repressed – suppressed, maybe in psychological terms, but in genetics, it's about dominance.

So the term for an allele that's masked is recessive. The recessive allele doesn't show its trait because the dominant allele is expressed instead. Therefore, the correct answer should be H: recessive.

The correct answer is H: recessive. An allele that is masked is referred to as recessive because it is hidden by the expression of a dominant allele.

Answer: H
