Okay, so I've got this economics question here about what happens when taxes are cut in an economy that's already at full employment equilibrium. Hmm, I remember that full employment means the economy is producing at its potential output, right? So any tax cut is likely to affect aggregate demand because people have more disposable income, which should increase consumption.

Wait, but wait, in the short run, a tax cut would definitely boost AD, leading to higher output and maybe higher prices. But the question is about the long run. In the long run, the economy adjusts. So, with higher AD in the short run, the price level might rise, but in the long run, if the economy is at full employment, does it mean that the output can't increase beyond potential? So any increase in AD would just lead to higher prices, not higher output.

But wait, another thought: if taxes are cut, maybe it changes the incentive to work or invest, which could affect the supply side. Oh, but the question is about the effect on real output and price level in the long run after a tax cut. So in the long run, the economy is back to full employment, so real output should remain the same, but prices might adjust based on expectations.

Wait, no, the initial equilibrium is already at full employment. So in the short run, a tax cut would cause AD to shift right, leading to higher output and higher prices. But since the economy is at full employment, perhaps in the long run, output can't increase, so prices rise instead. So in the long run, real output would be the same, but prices would be higher.

Wait, but looking at the options, H says raise real output without affecting price level. But that's in the short run perhaps. In the long run, if the economy was already at full employment, then a tax cut might lead to higher prices because the extra demand can't be met with more output, so prices go up.

Wait, but the options are about the long run effect. So let me think again. In the long run, the economy adjusts. If taxes are cut, it's a permanent change. So maybe investment increases because lower taxes encourage more saving or investment, leading to an increase in productive capacity, which would increase potential output. But wait, that's more about the supply side. But in the question, the economy is already at full employment, so if taxes are cut, in the short run, people consume more, AD shifts, output increases beyond full employment, but that can't be sustained. So in the long run, maybe the economy's potential output increases, so the tax cut leads to higher real output and perhaps higher prices if there's inflation.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let's try to break it down. The question is about the long run effect of a tax cut when the economy is at full employment equilibrium.

In the short run, lower taxes increase disposable income, so consumption increases, AD increases, leading to higher output and possibly higher prices. But in the long run, prices might adjust, and output may not be able to keep increasing beyond potential. So if the economy was at full employment, and in the short run, output goes up, but in the long run, the economy adjusts, perhaps prices rise, but output returns to full employment.

Wait, but that might not be right. Alternatively, in the long run, the tax cut could lead to higher investment, which increases the capital stock and shifts the LRAS curve to the right. So the economy's potential output increases. So in the long run, real output can be higher, and the price level might adjust accordingly.

Wait, but the initial economy is at full employment. If taxes are cut, leading to higher AD, but in the long run, if the economy's productive capacity (LRAS) increases, then real output can go up without causing inflation. So the price level might not change because the increase in demand is met with an increase in supply.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think of the AS-AD model. Initially, the economy is at full employment, so AD intersects AS at that point. A tax cut increases AD, shifting it to the right. In the short run, this could lead to higher output and higher prices. But in the long run, if the tax cut leads to more investment and thus higher LRAS, then the new AD curve would intersect the new LRAS higher, leading to higher real output and the same or possibly lower price level if prices adjust.

Alternatively, if the tax cut doesn't affect LRAS, then in the long run, the economy would adjust so that the higher AD is met by a higher price level, with output returning to full employment. But if the tax cut leads to structural changes (like more investment), then LRAS shifts right, leading to higher output and lower prices.

Wait, but the question is about the effect of a tax cut in the long run. So if the tax cut is a demand-side policy, it would cause AD to increase, but if the economy is already at full employment, the long run effect might be higher prices without higher output. But if the tax cut affects the supply side, like encouraging investment, then LRAS could shift, allowing output to rise without prices necessarily rising.

I'm a bit torn between options H and I. Option H says real output rises without affecting the price level. Option I says output rises and price level rises.

But since the economy was initially at full employment, a tax cut might not increase output in the long run if it's just a demand-side boost. Alternatively, if it leads to supply-side changes, output could rise without price changes.

Wait, but in the long run, if the economy's potential output increases (like more investment), then the price level might not rise because the increase in demand is matched by an increase in supply.

Alternatively, perhaps in the long run, the economy's output remains the same, but prices adjust. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: in the long run, the economy self-corrects. So if taxes are cut, leading to higher AD, but the SRAS and LRAS curves adjust. If the tax cut doesn't change LRAS, then in the long run, higher AD would lead to higher prices and the same output (as economy returns to full employment). But if the tax cut causes LRAS to shift right, then output can increase without price changes.

But the question doesn't specify whether the tax cut affects the supply side. It's just a tax cut, which primarily affects consumption (C), so it's a demand-side policy.

So in the long run, with just a demand increase, the economy would have higher prices but the same output. But the initial economy was at full employment, so cutting taxes would cause AD to increase, leading to higher output in the short run, but in the long run, prices rise and output remains at full employment.

Wait, but the question asks what happens in the long run. So if the economy is at full employment, and taxes are cut, leading to higher AD, but in the long run, the economy adjusts. So in the long run, the price level might rise, and output would be back at full employment, meaning no change in output. But that's not one of the options. Alternatively, if the tax cut leads to higher investment, then LRAS shifts right, allowing higher output without inflation.

But the question doesn't specify whether the tax cut affects investment. It's a general tax cut, so it's possible that it does. So in that case, in the long run, output could increase and prices might not rise as much or could even fall if supply increases more.

Wait, but I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about what the standard answer is. A tax cut is a form of expansionary fiscal policy. In the short run, it increases AD, leading to higher output and possibly higher prices. In the long run, if the economy is at full employment, the increase in AD would lead to higher prices without higher output because output can't increase beyond potential. But if the tax cut leads to increased investment, shifting the LRAS curve, then output could rise and prices might not rise as much.

Wait, but the question is about the long run effect. So suppose the tax cut is a one-time thing, not part of a structural change. Then in the long run, the economy adjusts, and output goes back to full employment, with higher prices. But in that case, the output remains the same, and prices rise.

But looking at the options, none of them say that output remains the same and prices rise. Let's check the options again.

Options:

A: no effect on price, raise output.

B: lower output, no effect on price.

C: lower price.

D: no effect on both.

E: raise output and lower price.

F: lower output and lower price.

G: raise price.

H: raise output without affecting price.

I: raise output and raise price.

J: lower output and raise price.

Wait, none of them say output same, price up. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the tax cut doesn't affect the long-run aggregate supply. So in the long run, higher AD would mean higher price level, but output remains at full employment. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is H: raise real output without affecting price level.

Wait, but how? If the economy is at full employment and you cut taxes, in the long run, output can't go beyond full employment. So perhaps the output remains the same, and the price level rises. But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. In the long run, the economy is at full employment. A tax cut increases disposable income, leading to higher consumption. So AD increases. In the short run, this leads to higher output and higher prices. But in the long run, the economy adjusts. If the tax cut is a one-time boost, then in the long run, the economy returns to full employment, but with higher prices because of the increased demand.

But since the question is about the long run effect, perhaps the economy's price level rises, and output remains the same. But the options don't have that. So I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the tax cut leads to higher investment, shifting the LRAS curve to the right. So in the long run, output can increase, and the price level may not rise as much or could even fall. So the output increases, and the price level might not change or could even decrease if supply increases more than demand.

But the options say H: output up, price same. I: output up, price up.

So if the tax cut leads to higher investment, which increases LRAS, then in the long run, output could rise and prices might not rise or could even fall. So perhaps the price level doesn't change, and output rises. That would be option H.

Alternatively, maybe the tax cut doesn't affect investment, so in the long run, output remains the same, and prices rise, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is H: raise real output without affecting the price level.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Another way to think: in the long run, the economy's price level is determined by expectations and the money supply. If the tax cut increases AD but doesn't change LRAS, then prices rise, and output remains the same. But since the options don't have that, I must have misunderstood.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that in the long run, the tax cut leads to higher real output because it increases incentives to work or invest, thus shifting LRAS right. So output increases, and prices might not change because the increase in supply meets the increase in demand.

So I think the correct answer is H: raise real output without affecting the price level.

When taxes are cut in an economy that is already at full employment equilibrium, the primary effect is on aggregate demand (AD). Lower taxes increase disposable income, leading to higher consumption and a rightward shift in the AD curve. In the short run, this results in higher output and potentially higher prices. However, the question focuses on the long-run effects.

In the long run, the economy adjusts to the new circumstances. If the tax cut does not alter the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS), the economy will return to full employment, but the price level may rise due to the increased demand. However, if the tax cut incentivizes more investment or productivity, the LRAS curve could shift to the right, increasing the economy's potential output. This structural change would allow real output to rise without causing inflation, as the supply side expands to meet the higher demand.

Given the options, the most consistent answer with this reasoning is that the tax cut raises real output without affecting the price level, assuming the tax cut leads to supply-side adjustments like increased investment. This aligns with option H.
