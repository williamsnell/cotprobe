Okay, I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. So, the question is about an ice cube placed in water and what happens to them. Let's see, the problem states that a 200 g ice cube is placed into 500 g of water at 20°C, and we need to find the resultant situation. The options are A through J, each describing different scenarios of ice remaining and the final temperature.

Hmm, I remember that when ice and water are mixed, the key is to consider the heat transfer between them. Since ice is at 0°C and water is at 20°C, the water will transfer heat to the ice until thermal equilibrium is reached. But wait, the ice can only absorb heat until it either melts completely or the water cools down to 0°C, depending on the amount of ice and water.

So, first, I think I need to calculate whether all the ice will melt, or whether some of it will remain, or maybe even if the water can't cool down enough and some ice remains. Let's break it down.

I recall that the heat lost by the water will be used to melt the ice or to raise the temperature of the ice to 0°C. Wait, no, the ice is already at 0°C, so the heat from the water will first warm up the ice, but wait, ice is at 0°C, so the water will just either melt the ice or cool down.

Wait, no, the ice is at 0°C, so the water at 20°C will transfer heat to the ice. The heat from the water will cause the ice to melt, but only if there's enough heat to do so. Alternatively, if there's not enough heat, the water will cool down, and some ice may remain.

Wait, no, actually, when ice is placed in warmer water, the water will transfer heat to the ice. The ice will absorb heat, which can either melt some or all of it, or the water might cool down to 0°C, and both will be at 0°C with some ice remaining.

So, the process here is to calculate how much heat the water can give up before it cools to 0°C, and see if that's enough to melt all the ice, or if some remains.

So the formula I need is Q = mcΔT, where m is mass, c is specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

The specific heat capacity of water is 4.184 J/(g°C). Ice has a different specific heat, but since the ice is at 0°C, and the water is above that, the heat from the water will first raise the ice's temperature to 0°C, but wait, the ice is already at 0°C, so that part isn't needed. So the heat will go into melting the ice and then possibly raise the temperature of the melted ice or the surrounding water.

Wait, no. The ice is at 0°C, so the heat from the water will either melt the ice or cause the water to cool down. Let me think again.

The maximum heat the water can give before it reaches 0°C is Q_water = m_water * c_water * ΔT. Here, m_water is 500 g, c_water is 4.184 J/g°C, and ΔT is 20°C (from 20°C to 0°C). So Q_water = 500 * 4.184 * 20.

Let me calculate that. 500 * 4.184 is 2092. Multiply by 20: 2092 * 20 = 41,840 J. So the water can give off 41,840 J of heat before cooling to 0°C.

Now, the heat required to melt the ice is Q_melt = m_ice * Lf, where Lf is the latent heat of fusion for ice. I think Lf is about 334 J/g. So for 200 g of ice, Q_melt = 200 * 334 = 66,800 J.

Wait, but the water can only provide 41,840 J. So the heat from the water is less than the heat needed to melt all the ice. That means the ice won't all melt; instead, the water will cool down, and some ice will remain.

Wait, no, I think I might have mixed up the direction. Wait, when ice is placed in water, the ice absorbs heat from the water. So the water will lose heat, and the ice will gain heat. But in this case, the ice is at 0°C, and the water is at 20°C. So the water can give off heat, which can either melt the ice or cool the water down.

So, the heat available from the water is 41,840 J. The heat required to melt all 200 g of ice is 66,800 J. Since 41,840 < 66,800, the water can't melt all the ice. Therefore, not all ice will melt, and the water will cool down to a temperature above 0°C, but wait, no, because the ice requires more heat than the water can provide, so the final temperature will be 0°C, and some ice will remain.

Wait, but wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. The water can give off 41,840 J. The ice requires 66,800 J to melt completely. So only part of the ice will melt. The rest will remain as ice, and the water will cool down until it reaches 0°C, at which point the remaining heat will melt some ice.

Wait, but the calculation is a bit more precise. So, the heat from the water will first cool it down to 0°C, which uses up 41,840 J. Then, any remaining heat would go into melting ice. But wait, in this case, the water's heat is used up, so after cooling the water to 0°C, there's no more heat left to melt any ice. So, the ice remains as it is, but the water is now at 0°C.

Wait, but that can't be right because the ice is at 0°C. So the ice and water would both be at 0°C, and any excess heat would melt some ice. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Let me approach it differently. The water at 20°C will lose heat, and the ice at 0°C will absorb it. The heat from the water can either:

1. Cool the water from 20°C to 0°C, which uses Q1 = m_water * c_water * ΔT = 500 * 4.184 * 20 = 41,840 J.

2. Then, any remaining heat would go into melting the ice. But since the water can only provide 41,840 J, and melting 200 g of ice needs 66,800 J, the water's heat is insufficient to melt all the ice. So, the water will cool to 0°C, and then the ice will absorb some heat to melt. But since the water is now at 0°C, any further heat transfer would cause the ice to melt and the water to stay at 0°C. So, the heat from the water cooling to 0°C is exactly 41,840 J. How much ice can that melt?

The heat to melt ice is Q = m_ice * Lf. So m_ice melted would be Q_available / Lf = 41,840 J / 334 J/g ≈ 125 g.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the water can provide enough heat to melt 125 g of ice (since 125 * 334 = 41,750 J, which is close to 41,840). So, 125 g of ice melts, leaving the remaining ice as 200 - 125 = 75 g. So, after the heat transfer, the ice remaining is 75 g, and the water is now at 0°C, and the total mass of water is 500 + 125 = 625 g.

Wait, but wait, the ice that's melted adds to the water. So the total mass of water becomes 500 + 125 = 625 g, but the ice remaining is 75 g. So the final state is 75 g of ice floating in 625 g of water at 0°C.

Looking at the options, option H says 75 g block of ice floating in water at 0°C. That seems correct.

Wait, let me double-check. The water loses 41,840 J, which is enough to melt 125 g of ice. So 200 g of ice minus 125 g melted leaves 75 g of ice. The water is now at 0°C, and the ice is floating. So yes, option H is correct.

The problem involves determining the resultant situation when a 200 g ice cube is placed in 500 g of water at 20°C. The key is to calculate the heat transfer between the water and the ice.

1. **Heat Available from Water**: The water can give off heat as it cools to 0°C. Using the formula \( Q = m \cdot c \cdot \Delta T \), where \( m = 500 \, \text{g} \), \( c = 4.184 \, \text{J/(g°C)} \), and \( \Delta T = 20 \, \text{°C} \), the heat available is:
   \[
   Q_{\text{water}} = 500 \cdot 4.184 \cdot 20 = 41,840 \, \text{J}.
   \]

2. **Heat Required to Melt Ice**: The heat required to melt all 200 g of ice is:
   \[
   Q_{\text{melt}} = m_{\text{ice}} \cdot L_f = 200 \cdot 334 = 66,800 \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Since \( Q_{\text{water}} < Q_{\text{melt}} \), not all the ice will melt.

3. **Heat to Melt Part of the Ice**: The heat from the water (41,840 J) can melt:
   \[
   m_{\text{melted}} = \frac{Q_{\text{water}}}{L_f} = \frac{41,840}{334} \approx 125 \, \text{g}.
   \]
   Thus, 125 g of ice melts, leaving \( 200 - 125 = 75 \, \text{g} \) of ice remaining.

4. **Final State**: The water cools to 0°C, and 75 g of ice remains floating in the water. The total mass of water becomes \( 500 + 125 = 625 \, \text{g} \).

From the options, the correct answer is **H: 75 g block of ice floating in water at 0°C**.
