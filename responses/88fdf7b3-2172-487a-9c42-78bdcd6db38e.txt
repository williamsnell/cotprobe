Question:

This question refers to the following information.
The following quote is from Voltaire in response to the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.
My dear sir, nature is very cruel. One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds. A hundred thousand ants, our fellows, crushed all at once in our ant-hill, and half of them perishing, no doubt in unspeakable agony, beneath the wreckage from which they cannot be drawn. Families ruined all over Europe, the fortune of a hundred businessmen, your compatriots, swallowed up in the ruins of Lisbon. What a wretched gamble is the game of human life! What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend father inquisitors have been crushed like others. That ought to teach men not to persecute each other, for while a few holy scoundrels burn a few fanatics, the earth swallows up one and all.
â€”Voltaire, in a letter, 1755

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which characteristic of Enlightenment intellectuals Voltaire's quote best illustrates. Let me go through this step by step.

First, the quote is about the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. Voltaire is reacting to the devastation and questioning how such a disaster fits into the concept of a "best of all possible worlds," which I think refers to the philosophical idea that we live in the best possible universe as per Leibniz. He's clearly upset and critical here.

Looking at the options provided, I need to see which one aligns with Voltaire's ideas. Let's go through each option:

A: Believed in preserving traditional religious doctrines. Well, Voltaire was known for his criticism of the Church, so this probably isn't right.

B: Most rejected religion and adopted atheism. While Voltaire was critical of the Church, he wasn't necessarily an atheist. He was more of a deist, I believe, so this might not be the best fit.

C: Disconnected from common people. The quote shows empathy for the victims, so this seems opposite. He's clearly concerned about the suffering of many people, so this option is likely incorrect.

D: Endorsed absolute monarchy. Voltaire was critical of many institutions, including the monarchy in some contexts, so this doesn't seem right.

E: Human suffering is inevitable and justified. The quote seems to question the existence of such a cruel world, so this might be a contender. He's expressing horror at the suffering, not accepting it as justified.

F: Rejected scientific impact on society. Voltaire was an Enlightenment thinker, so he probably supported science. This option doesn't fit.

G: Advocated for abolition of all governance. He was critical of some forms of governance, like the Inquisition, but not necessarily all. So maybe not this one.

H: Used new communication methods like salons and pamphlets. This is about the method of communication, which Voltaire did use, but the quote itself doesn't directly address that. So perhaps not the best fit here.

I: Believed new scientific discoveries justified a more tolerant and objective approach to social issues. The quote doesn't directly mention science, but Voltaire's Enlightenment context suggests he valued reason and science. This could be a possibility.

J: Many were scientists contributing to human understanding. Voltaire was a writer and philosopher, not a scientist, so this might not apply.

Wait, the quote is more about the philosophical implications of suffering and the role of religion. Voltaire is questioning the existence of a benevolent God if such suffering exists. He also criticizes the Inquisition, suggesting that religious persecution is wrong because natural disasters like earthquakes don't discriminate. This ties into Enlightenment ideas of questioning traditional authority, including religious, and advocating for reason and tolerance.

Looking back at the options, option I says they believed new scientific discoveries justified a more tolerant and objective approach. That makes sense because the Enlightenment emphasized using reason and science to understand the world, leading to more tolerant views. Voltaire's quote, while focusing on suffering, aligns with the broader Enlightenment push towards using reason to address social issues.

Alternatively, option E says suffering is inevitable and justified. But Voltaire's letter seems to reject that idea, questioning how such a disaster could happen in a supposedly best world. So E isn't the right choice.

Option I seems more accurate. The scientific discoveries of the time (like Newton's) were seen as showing a more rational and ordered universe, which Enlightenment thinkers used to argue for more tolerant societies. Voltaire's quote, while focused on critique, reflects this broader shift towards using reason and science to inform social views.

The ideas expressed by Voltaire in the quote reflect the Enlightenment's emphasis on using reason and science to address social issues, advocating for a more tolerant and objective approach. Voltaire's critique of the Lisbon earthquake and the Inquisition highlights his belief in questioning traditional authority and promoting rational inquiry, which aligns with the Enlightenment's broader goals.
