Question:

What results would you expect if the macronucleus were removed from a paramecium?

Options:

A: causes cell death
B: The paramecium would grow in size
C: The paramecium would undergo metamorphosis
D: increased cell activity
E: The paramecium would exhibit increased motility
F: cell multiplication
G: The paramecium would develop into a different species
H: The paramecium would display enhanced sensory perception
I: sexual reproduction
J: The paramecium would divide more rapidly

Okay, so I have this biology question about Paramecium and what happens if their macronucleus is removed. Hmm, I remember that Paramecium is a type of protozoan, right? And they have these two types of nuclei: a macronucleus and a micronucleus. Wait, what's the difference between them? Oh right, the macronucleus is the big one and it's responsible for most of the regular cell functions, like handling the genes for daily activities. The micronucleus is smaller and is involved in things like sexual reproduction, especially during conjugation when they exchange genetic material.

So the question is, what happens if the macronucleus is removed? Let me think. Without the macronucleus, the cell would lose its ability to perform normal functions. Because the macronucleus has the majority of the genetic information needed for the cell's daily operations. I remember that in some experiments, when the macronucleus is removed, the cell can't survive for long. It can't carry out its normal metabolic activities, so it would probably die. 

Looking at the options, option A says "causes cell death." That makes sense. Let me check the other options to see if any make more sense. Option B says the paramecium would grow in size. Without the macronucleus, I don't think it can grow because it can't regulate its cell cycle properly. Option C says metamorphosis, which is more about changing forms, like in insects, not relevant here. Option D is increased cell activity, which doesn't make sense because without the nucleus, activity would decrease.

Option E is increased motility. Paramecium moves using cilia, but without the nucleus, they might not be able to maintain that movement. Option F is cell multiplication, which is division. Without the nucleus, especially the macronucleus, the cell can't divide because the genetic info isn't there. Option G is developing into a different species, which is way off. Option H is enhanced sensory perception, but without the nucleus, the cell can't process sensory info. Option I is sexual reproduction, which is handled by the micronucleus, so removing the macronucleus wouldn't stop that immediately, but the cell would die so it wouldn't reproduce anyway. Option J is dividing more rapidly, which again, without the nucleus, division can't happen.

So the only option that makes sense is A: causes cell death. Because the macronucleus is essential for the cell's survival and normal functioning. Without it, the cell can't survive.

The macronucleus in Paramecium is essential for its survival and normal cellular functions. Removing it would lead to cell death, as the macronucleus provides the genetic information necessary for metabolic activities and other essential processes.
