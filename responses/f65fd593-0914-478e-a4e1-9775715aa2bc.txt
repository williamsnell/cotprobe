Question:

A 67-year-old man with Parkinson disease is admitted to the hospital for treatment of pneumonia. The patient's daughter, who is visiting the patient, says he has had increased lethargy for the past day and decreased ambulation during the past 6 months. She also says that there are times during the day when his tremors increase in severity, although he continues to care for himself at home. Medical history is also remarkable for hypertension. Medications include hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, levodopa, and carbidopa. He is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 78 kg (172 lb); BMI is 28 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 38.9°C (102.0°F), pulse 60/min supine and 68/min standing, respirations 22/min, and blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg supine and 80/50 mm Hg standing. The patient appears ill and older than his stated age. He is fully oriented but lethargic. Auscultation of the chest discloses rhonchi in the right mid lung field. Abdominal examination discloses no abnormalities. Neurologic examination discloses masked facies, bradykinesia, and cogwheel rigidity; gait was not assessed on admission. Chest x-ray shows a right lower lobe infiltrate. ECG shows no abnormalities. Appropriate intravenous antibiotic therapy is initiated. Prior to discharge, which of the following is the most appropriate step?

Options:

A: Begin corticosteroid treatment
B: Place a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube
C: Administer influenza vaccine
D: Prescribe fludrocortisone
E: Discontinue levodopa and carbidopa
F: Arrange for home oxygen therapy
G: Initiate physical therapy
H: Obtain CT scan of the chest
I: Obtain a swallowing evaluation
J: Start patient on anticoagulant therapy

Okay, let me try to work through this question step by step. So, the patient is a 67-year-old man with Parkinson's disease who was admitted for pneumonia. His daughter mentioned he's been more lethargic and has decreased mobility over the past six months. He also has increased tremors at times but continues to care for himself. His medical history includes hypertension, and his medications are hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, levodopa, and carbidopa.

Looking at his vitals: he has a high temperature, which makes sense because he has pneumonia. His blood pressure is lower when standing, which could indicate orthostatic hypotension. Parkinson's patients often have issues with blood pressure regulation, so that's probably related. He appears ill, is lethargic, but oriented. On exam, he has masked facies, bradykinesia, and cogwheel rigidity—classic signs of Parkinson's, but his gait wasn't assessed yet.

The chest X-ray shows a right lower lobe infiltrate, and he's on IV antibiotics. Now, before discharge, what should be done next?

Let's look at the options:

A: Begin corticosteroid treatment. I don't think steroids are indicated here. He has pneumonia, which is bacterial, so antibiotics are the main treatment. Steroids might be used in certain cases, like if there's an inflammatory condition, but not sure it's needed here.

B: Place a PEG tube. He's still able to care for himself, so maybe he's still eating and swallowing okay. But his decreased mobility and lethargy might affect his ability, but without evidence of dysphagia, maybe not necessary yet.

C: Administer influenza vaccine. He might benefit from it, but that's more of a预防 measure, and he's in the hospital now with pneumonia. Maybe it's not the most urgent step before discharge.

D: Prescribe fludrocortisone. That's for orthostatic hypotension. His BP drops when standing, which is a problem in Parkinson's. Maybe this would help with his blood pressure issues. But is this the most immediate concern before discharge?

E: Discontinue levodopa and carbidopa. That seems drastic. These are his main Parkinson's medications. Discontinuing them could worsen his condition. Unless there's a specific reason, like side effects, which don't seem to be mentioned, this doesn't seem right.

F: Arrange for home oxygen therapy. His oxygen levels aren't mentioned, so unless he's hypoxic, maybe not necessary. The chest x-ray shows an infiltrate, but without specific SpO2 info, I'm not sure.

G: Initiate physical therapy. Given his decreased mobility over six months and the hospitalization, PT could help with mobility. Since he's been less mobile, PT might be beneficial upon discharge to prevent further decline.

H: Obtain CT scan of the chest. The chest x-ray already shows an infiltrate. A CT might give more detail, but unless there's a specific indication like suspected abscess or other complications, maybe it's not necessary unless the initial treatment isn't working.

I: Obtain a swallowing evaluation. His daughter mentioned increased lethargy and decreased ambulation, but not specific issues with swallowing. However, pneumonia can sometimes lead to aspiration, and if he's lethargic, maybe he's at risk for aspiration pneumonia. Evaluating his swallow function could prevent future issues, especially in someone with Parkinson's who might have silent aspiration.

J: Start anticoagulant therapy. He's in the hospital for pneumonia, which is an infection. Anticoagulants are usually for DVT or PE prevention, but without signs of thrombosis, maybe it's not indicated yet. Unless he's bedridden, but he's at home, so maybe not.

So, considering all options, the most appropriate steps before discharge would likely involve addressing his mobility, dysphagia risk, and managing his Parkinson's symptoms. He's been less mobile, so physical therapy (G) could help. Also, evaluating his swallowing (I) to prevent aspiration is important, especially since he's been more lethargic. Alternatively, fludrocortisone (D) for his low BP could be important to prevent further episodes of hypotension, which could cause falls or worsen his condition.

But the question is about the most appropriate step. Since he's already on IV antibiotics for pneumonia, and the main issues now are his mobility decline and possible dysphagia, maybe the swallowing evaluation is more critical to prevent future complications. Alternatively, physical therapy to help him regain mobility post-discharge.

Wait, but the question is about what to do before discharge. So, if he's been less mobile, maybe initiating PT upon discharge would help. Also, given his orthostatic hypotension, fludrocortisone could be started to manage his BP better, which might help with his symptoms.

But looking at the options, which is more pressing? Maybe the swallowing evaluation is important because if he has dysphagia, it could lead to aspiration, which would require a PEG tube if severe, but he's still managing at home. Alternatively, addressing his mobility with PT could help his overall function.

I'm a bit torn between options G, I, and D. But the question is about the most appropriate step. If the patient is not yet assessed for swallowing, that could be a priority to prevent complications. So, obtaining a swallowing evaluation (I) seems important before discharge.

The patient is a 67-year-old man with Parkinson's disease admitted for pneumonia. He has a history of hypertension and is on hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, levodopa, and carbidopa. His vital signs show orthostatic hypotension, and he appears lethargic with signs of Parkinson's disease. The chest X-ray confirms pneumonia, and he is on IV antibiotics. The most appropriate step before discharge involves addressing his mobility decline and potential swallowing issues, as these are critical for his recovery and prevention of future complications. Evaluating his swallowing function (I) is essential to rule out dysphagia, which could lead to aspiration pneumonia, especially given his lethargy. Therefore, the best choice is to obtain a swallowing evaluation.
