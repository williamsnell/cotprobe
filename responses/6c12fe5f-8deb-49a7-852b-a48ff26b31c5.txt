Question:

A debtor owed a creditor $750 on an old debt. On July 1, the debt was barred by the statute of limitations. On August 1, the debtor ran into the creditor at a party and overheard him telling mutual friends that the debtor "is a deadbeat who weiches on his debts. " Feeling pangs of guilt, the debtor approached the creditor and orally agreed to pay him the $750 debt on September 1. The debtor refused to pay the creditor the $750 as promised on September 1St. If the creditor sues the debtor to recover the $750 debt, which would provide the strongest grounds that the debtor's oral promise was unenforceable?

Options:

A: There was no mutuality of obligation.
B: The creditor's claim was based on hearsay.
C: The promise was made out of guilt, not legal obligation.
D: It was violative of the statute of frauds.
E: The debtor was under duress when he made the promise.
F: The debtor had no legal capacity to enter into the agreement.
G: The debt was already barred by the statute of limitations.
H: The promise was not made in a formal legal setting.
I: It was not supported by new consideration.
J: The debtor did not provide a written agreement for the promise.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about whether the debtor's oral promise to pay the $750 debt is enforceable. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the situation: The debtor owed the creditor $750, and on July 1, the debt was barred by the statute of limitations. That means the creditor can't sue on that debt anymore because the time period for filing a lawsuit has passed. Then, on August 1, the debtor hears the creditor call him a deadbeat and feels guilty. The debtor then orally agrees to pay $750 by September 1 but doesn't do it. Now, the creditor is suing to recover the debt, and we need to find the strongest reason the oral promise is unenforceable.

Looking at the options, I need to recall some contract law principles. An enforceable contract requires consideration, mutual agreement, and sometimes a writing if it's a debt over a certain amount or under specific statutes.

Wait, the original debt was already barred. So, on July 1, the debt was time-barred. Then, on August 1, the debtor makes an oral promise to pay. Now, in contract law, if there's a new promise to pay an otherwise time-barred debt, it might revive the debt if there's new consideration. But I think under the Statute of Frauds, certain contracts must be in writing to be enforceable. The amount here is $750, but I'm not sure if that's over the threshold for the Statute of Frauds. In many jurisdictions, debts over $500 or $1000 need to be in writing, but I'm not certain about this one.

Another point is that the original debt was barred, so the debtor's oral promise might be considered a new contract. If there's no new consideration, then the promise wouldn't be enforceable. Wait, but in this case, the debtor is promising to pay, which would be consideration from both sides? Or is it just a promise without anything in return?

Actually, when a person agrees to pay a time-barred debt, the promise is only enforceable if there's new consideration. Here, the debtor's promise is made out of guilt, but is that sufficient consideration? I think that under the pre-existing duty rule, a promise to do something you're already legally obligated to do isn't sufficient consideration unless there's a new benefit or detriment. But in this case, the original debt was already barred, so the debtor isn't under any legal obligation anymore. So, the debtor's promise to pay might lack consideration because there's no new benefit to the creditor beyond what was already owed, which was time-barred.

Alternatively, maybe the issue is that the original debt was barred by the statute of limitations, and any subsequent oral promise to pay it doesn't count unless it's in writing. But I'm not sure if that's the case. The statute of limitations affects the ability to sue on the original debt, but if the debtor makes a new promise, it might create a new cause of action unless it's within the Statute of Frauds.

Wait, the Statute of Frauds requires certain contracts to be in writing, typically those involving real estate, suretyship, or debts over a certain amount. If $750 is over the threshold, then the oral promise would be unenforceable because it's within the Statute of Frauds. But I'm not certain about the exact amount threshold here.

Looking at the options, option D says it's violative of the Statute of Frauds. Option I says there's no new consideration. Option G says the debt was already barred.

So, the debtor's oral promise on August 1 would be a new contract. If the amount is over the Statute of Frauds threshold, then it must be in writing. If it's not, then the oral promise is unenforceable. So, if $750 is over the threshold, then D would be the answer. But if the threshold is higher, say $2000, then it's not, so D wouldn't apply.

Alternatively, if the consideration is lacking, then I would be the answer. But in this case, the debtor's promise is to pay the debt, which could be consideration because it's a new promise. Wait, no, because the pre-existing duty rule applies. Since the debt was already barred, the debtor wasn't obligated anymore. So, the promise to pay now would require new consideration. The debtor's guilt isn't enough if there's no new benefit to the creditor.

Wait, but if the creditor agreed to something in return, like not suing, that would be consideration. But in this case, the debtor just promised to pay without any reciprocal promise from the creditor. So, the promise might lack consideration, making it unenforceable. That would point to option I.

But wait, another angle: the original debt was barred, so the debtor's promise is to pay on a debt that's already time-barred. Under the law, a new promise to pay a time-barred debt without a written agreement might not be enforceable unless there's new consideration. So, if the debtor is promising to pay without receiving anything new, there's no consideration, so the promise is unenforceable.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the debt was already barred, so any subsequent promise doesn't revive it unless in writing. But I'm not sure if G is the correct answer because G says the debt was already barred, but the new promise creates a new obligation. Hmm.

Wait, the question is about the oral promise being unenforceable. So, if the original debt was barred, but the debtor made a new oral promise, the question is why that promise isn't enforceable.

If the amount is over the Statute of Frauds threshold, then the promise must be in writing, so D would be correct. If not, then the issue is consideration.

But I'm not sure about the exact Statute of Frauds amount here. If the jurisdiction requires contracts over $500 to be in writing, then $750 would fall under that, making D correct. Otherwise, the lack of consideration (I) would be the issue.

In many states, the Statute of Frauds requires contracts for $500 or more to be in writing. If that's the case, then the oral promise would be unenforceable because it's within the Statute of Frauds, and D is the answer. Alternatively, if the threshold is higher, then I would be the issue.

Another point: the original debt was $750, so if the promise to pay that same amount is made orally, it's within the Statute of Frauds. So, D would apply.

So, considering all that, I think the answer is either D or I. But I'm leaning towards D because the amount might be over the threshold, making the oral promise unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds.

The question revolves around whether the debtor's oral promise to pay a $750 debt, which was previously barred by the statute of limitations, is enforceable. The key issue is identifying the strongest grounds for why the oral promise might be unenforceable.

1. **Statute of Frauds**: Many jurisdictions require contracts for debts over a certain amount (often $500) to be in writing to be enforceable. Since the debt is $750, it likely falls under the Statute of Frauds, making the oral promise unenforceable.

2. **Consideration**: The debtor's promise was made out of guilt, but there was no new consideration. Under the pre-existing duty rule, a promise to pay a debt that was already barred does not constitute valid consideration unless something new is exchanged.

While both D (Statute of Frauds) and I (lack of consideration) are strong arguments, the Statute of Frauds is the more compelling reason because the oral promise involves a debt amount typically requiring a written agreement.

Answer: D
