Okay, so I have this integral to compute: the line integral of (x dy - y dx) divided by (x² + y²) around a closed curve Γ. Γ is piecewise smooth, closed, and it encloses the origin but doesn't pass through it. Hmm, I remember this kind of integral from my vector calculus class. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I recall that line integrals can sometimes be evaluated using Green's Theorem. Green's Theorem relates a line integral around a simple closed curve to a double integral over the region it encloses. The theorem states that ∫_Γ P dx + Q dy = ∬_D (∂Q/∂x - ∂P/∂y) dA, where D is the region inside Γ.

In this case, the integrand is (x dy - y dx)/(x² + y²). So I can rewrite this as (x dy)/(x² + y²) - (y dx)/(x² + y²). That makes P = -y/(x² + y²) and Q = x/(x² + y²).

Now, applying Green's Theorem, I need to compute ∂Q/∂x and ∂P/∂y.

Let's compute ∂Q/∂x first. Q = x/(x² + y²). So the partial derivative with respect to x is:

∂Q/∂x = [ (1)(x² + y²) - x*(2x) ] / (x² + y²)^2
= [x² + y² - 2x²] / (x² + y²)^2
= (y² - x²) / (x² + y²)^2.

Next, compute ∂P/∂y. P = -y/(x² + y²). So the partial derivative with respect to y is:

∂P/∂y = [ -1*(x² + y²) - (-y)*(2y) ] / (x² + y²)^2
= [ -x² - y² + 2y² ] / (x² + y²)^2
= (-x² + y²) / (x² + y²)^2.

Now, subtracting ∂P/∂y from ∂Q/∂x gives:

∂Q/∂x - ∂P/∂y = [ (y² - x²) - (-x² + y²) ] / (x² + y²)^2
= (y² - x² + x² - y²) / (x² + y²)^2
= 0 / (x² + y²)^2
= 0.

Wait, that's zero. So according to Green's Theorem, the double integral is zero. That would mean the line integral is zero as well. But wait, isn't there a caveat when the origin is enclosed? Because the integrand has a singularity at the origin, right? So maybe Green's Theorem doesn't apply directly here.

Oh right! Green's Theorem requires that the vector field is defined and differentiable everywhere inside and on the curve Γ. But in this case, the integrand (x dy - y dx)/(x² + y²) is not defined at the origin because the denominator becomes zero. So if Γ encloses the origin, the conditions for Green's Theorem aren't fully satisfied. That means I can't directly apply Green's Theorem here.

Hmm, so what else can I do? Maybe I should parameterize the curve or use some other theorem. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider a small circle around the origin that's entirely inside Γ and apply Green's Theorem there, then subtract the integral around that small circle.

Wait, another thought: I remember that this integral is related to the circulation of a vector field. The integrand (x dy - y dx)/(x² + y²) is similar to the 2D version of the curl. Alternatively, maybe it's connected to the concept of the winding number.

Let me think about polar coordinates. If I switch to polar coordinates, where x = r cosθ and y = r sinθ, then dy = cosθ dr - r sinθ dθ, and dx = -r sinθ dr + r cosθ dθ. Let me substitute these into the integral.

Wait, no, maybe that's complicating things. Another approach: consider that (x dy - y dx) is equal to r² dθ. Because in polar coordinates, x dy - y dx = r² dθ. Let me verify that:

x dy = (r cosθ)(cosθ dr - r sinθ dθ) = r cos²θ dr - r² cosθ sinθ dθ.
y dx = (r sinθ)(-r sinθ dr + r cosθ dθ) = -r² sin²θ dr + r² sinθ cosθ dθ.

Subtracting y dx from x dy:
x dy - y dx = [r cos²θ dr - r² cosθ sinθ dθ] - [-r² sin²θ dr + r² sinθ cosθ dθ]
= r cos²θ dr - r² cosθ sinθ dθ + r² sin²θ dr - r² sinθ cosθ dθ
= r (cos²θ + sin²θ) dr - 2 r² cosθ sinθ dθ
= r dr - r² sin(2θ) dθ.

Wait, that doesn't look right. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to see it.

I remember that in polar coordinates, dA = r dr dθ, and the differential forms dx and dy can be expressed as dx = cosθ dr - r sinθ dθ, dy = sinθ dr + r cosθ dθ.

So, let's compute x dy - y dx:

x dy = (r cosθ)(sinθ dr + r cosθ dθ) = r cosθ sinθ dr + r² cos²θ dθ.
y dx = (r sinθ)(cosθ dr - r sinθ dθ) = r sinθ cosθ dr - r² sin²θ dθ.

Subtracting y dx from x dy:

x dy - y dx = [r cosθ sinθ dr + r² cos²θ dθ] - [r sinθ cosθ dr - r² sin²θ dθ]
= r cosθ sinθ dr - r cosθ sinθ dr + r² cos²θ dθ + r² sin²θ dθ
= 0 + r² (cos²θ + sin²θ) dθ
= r² dθ.

So, x dy - y dx = r² dθ. Therefore, the integrand becomes (x dy - y dx)/(x² + y²) = (r² dθ)/(r²) = dθ.

Oh, that's much simpler! So the integral simplifies to ∫ dθ around the curve Γ. Now, since Γ is a closed curve that encloses the origin, how many times does it loop around the origin? If it's a simple closed curve, it loops once, so the integral of dθ would be 2π.

Wait, but wait. The integral of dθ around a closed curve that makes one full loop is indeed 2π. So, the integral ∫_Γ dθ = 2π. Therefore, the original integral is 2π.

Looking back at the options, I see that option I is 6.2831852, which is approximately 2π (since π is approximately 3.1415926, so 2π ≈ 6.2831852).

But wait a second, I just realized that in my earlier approach with Green's Theorem, I thought the integral might be zero, but that was under the assumption that Green's Theorem applies, which it doesn't because of the singularity at the origin. So instead, using the polar coordinate substitution, I found that the integral is 2π.

Alternatively, I might be confusing something here. Let me think again. The integral ∫ (x dy - y dx)/(x² + y²) over the closed curve Γ that encloses the origin is known as the circulation of the vector field ( -y/(x² + y²), x/(x² + y²) ). This vector field is actually a conservative field except at the origin. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, is this field conservative?

Wait, the vector field F = (-y/(x² + y²), x/(x² + y²)). Let me check if it's conservative by computing the curl. In 2D, the curl is ∂Q/∂x - ∂P/∂y. Earlier, I computed this and found it to be zero, except at the origin. So, the curl is zero everywhere except at the origin, which means the field is irrotational except at the origin. But that doesn't necessarily make it conservative because of the singularity at the origin.

So, because the origin is inside Γ, any closed loop around it will not be contractible to a point, and thus the integral around Γ is 2π. So the integral should be 2π, which is approximately 6.2831852, option I.

Wait, but wait another moment. The standard result for this integral is indeed 2π when the curve encloses the origin once. If the curve encloses the origin n times, the integral is 2πn. Since the problem states that Γ encloses the origin but doesn't specify the number of times, I assume it's once, so the answer is 2π.

So looking back at the options, option I is 6.2831852, which is 2π. So that's the correct answer.
</think>

The integral to compute is ∫_Γ (x dy - y dx)/(x² + y²), where Γ is a closed curve enclosing the origin. Using polar coordinates, the integrand simplifies to dθ. Since Γ encloses the origin once, the integral of dθ around Γ is 2π. Thus, the answer is 2π, which corresponds to option I.
