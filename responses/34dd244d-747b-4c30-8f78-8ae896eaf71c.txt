Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the electrostatic force between two point charges. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step. 

The question says: What's the magnitude of the electrostatic force between two 1.00 C point charges separated by 1.00 meter. The options are given from A to J. Hmm, I remember that this has something to do with Coulomb's Law. Let me think about that.

Coulomb's Law formula, right? It's F equals k times q1 times q2 divided by r squared. Oh wait, yeah, F = k(q1*q2)/r². So, k is Coulomb's constant. I think k is approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². Sometimes it's rounded to 9.00 x 10^9 for simplicity, but I guess the exact value might affect the answer.

Looking at the problem, both charges are 1.00 C. So q1 and q2 are both 1 C. The distance r is 1.00 m. Plugging those into the formula: F = (8.988e9) * (1 * 1) / (1)^2. Simplifying that, the denominator is 1, so it's just 8.988e9 N. Hmm, but wait, looking at the options, let me see which one matches that.

Option A is 7.99 x10^9 N. Option I is 8.99 x10^9 N. Oh, wait, wait. Oh right, sometimes the exact value is taken as approximately 9.00e9, so maybe the answer is close to 9e9. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option B is 9.00e10 N. That's way too big because 9e10 is ten times larger than 9e9. Option E is 10e9, which is also higher. Option I is 8.99e9, which is very close to 8.988e9. So that would be the correct value.

Wait, but wait, sometimes people use 9.00e9 as an approximate. So the exact calculation would give 8.988e9, which is close to option I (8.99e9). So the answer should be option I. Let me double-check the options. 

Option I is 8.99 x10^9 N. That makes sense because when you compute 8.988e9, that's approximately 8.99e9. So I think the correct answer is option I.

The magnitude of the electrostatic force is calculated using Coulomb's Law, \( F = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \). Substituting the given values (\( q_1 = 1.00 \, \text{C} \), \( q_2 = 1.00 \, \text{C} \), \( r = 1.00 \, \text{m} \)) and \( k \approx 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \), the force is approximately \( 8.99 \times 10^9 \, \text{N} \). This matches option I.

Answer: I
