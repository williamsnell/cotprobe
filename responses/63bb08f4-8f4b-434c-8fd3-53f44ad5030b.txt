Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says: If a real number x is chosen at random in the interval [0, 3] and a real number y is chosen at random in the interval [0, 4], what is the probability that x < y?

Hmm, so x and y are each selected uniformly from their respective intervals. I need to find the probability that x is less than y. Since both numbers are chosen independently, I think this is a problem involving joint probability distributions.

Let me visualize this. Since x is between 0 and 3, and y is between 0 and 4, I can represent all possible (x, y) pairs as points in a rectangle in the coordinate plane. The rectangle would have its corners at (0,0), (3,0), (3,4), and (0,4). So the area of this rectangle is the product of the lengths of the sides, which is 3 * 4 = 12. That's the total area representing all possible outcomes.

Now, I need to find the area within this rectangle where x < y. Because probability is the favorable area divided by the total area, once I find the area where x < y, I can divide it by 12 to get the probability.

So, let's think about the region where x < y. In the coordinate system, this would be the area above the line y = x. But wait, I have to consider the limits of x and y. Since x only goes up to 3, and y goes up to 4, the line y = x will only be relevant up to x=3, y=3. Beyond that, for x > 3, y can still be up to 4, but x can't be more than 3. Hmm, wait, no, x is only up to 3, so beyond x=3, it's not part of the rectangle. So, the line y = x goes from (0,0) to (3,3). So, the region where y > x is the area above this line within the rectangle.

But wait, the rectangle extends up to y=4, so beyond x=3, the line y=x would be at y=3, but since x can't go beyond 3, I think the region where y > x is the area above y=x from (0,0) to (3,3), plus the area from x=0 to x=3 where y ranges from 3 to 4, because for x from 0 to 3, y can be from x up to 4.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The region where x < y is all points where y is greater than x. So, in the rectangle, this would be the area above the line y=x, but since the rectangle goes up to y=4 and x=3, I need to break this into two parts.

First, from x=0 to x=3, the line y=x goes from (0,0) to (3,3). So above that line, within the rectangle, there are two regions:

1. From x=0 to x=3, y ranges from x to 4. But wait, no, because when x is less than 3, y can go up to 4, which is beyond the point (3,3). So actually, the area above y=x in the rectangle is the area of the triangle from (0,0) to (3,3) plus the area of the rectangle from x=0 to 3 and y=3 to 4.

Wait, no, that's not correct either. Let me sketch it mentally. The line y=x divides the square [0,3] x [0,3] into two equal triangles. But since our rectangle goes up to y=4, beyond x=3, y can go from 3 to 4, but x can't. So, actually, the region y > x is the triangle from (0,0) to (3,3) plus a rectangle from x=0 to 3, y=3 to 4.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because beyond x=3, y can still go up to 4, but x doesn't go beyond 3. So, for x in [0,3], y can be in [x,4]. So the area where y > x is the integral from x=0 to x=3 of (4 - x) dx.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the area geometrically. The total area is 12, as I thought earlier. The area where y > x is the area above the line y=x within the rectangle. So, let's compute this area.

The line y=x cuts the rectangle into two parts. From x=0 to x=3, y can be from x to 4. So the area above y=x is a combination of a triangle and a rectangle.

Wait, no, the area above y=x within the rectangle is a trapezoid. Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the area where y ≤ x and subtract that from the total area.

The area where y ≤ x is the area below the line y=x within the rectangle. Since the rectangle is up to y=4 and x=3, the line y=x intersects the rectangle at (3,3). So, the area below y=x is the area of the triangle from (0,0) to (3,3), which is (1/2)*3*3 = 4.5. But wait, that's only up to y=3. Beyond that, for y from 3 to 4, the area where y ≤ x is zero because x can't be more than 3, and y is up to 4.

So the area where y ≤ x is 4.5, and the total area is 12. Therefore, the area where y > x is 12 - 4.5 = 7.5.

Wait, that can't be right because 7.5 divided by 12 is 0.625, which is 5/8. But let me check again. Because I might have made a mistake in calculating the area where y ≤ x.

Wait, no, when x is in [0,3], y can be in [0,4]. So the area where y ≤ x is the integral from x=0 to x=3 of x dy dx. So integrating x from 0 to 3, and for each x, y goes from 0 to x. So the area is the integral from 0 to 3 of x dx, which is (1/2)x² evaluated from 0 to 3, which is (1/2)*9 = 4.5. So that's correct.

So the area where y > x is 12 - 4.5 = 7.5. Therefore, the probability is 7.5 / 12. Simplifying that, 7.5 is 15/2, so 15/2 divided by 12 is (15/2) * (1/12) = 15/24 = 5/8.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see option I is 5/8. So that would be the answer.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this using probability theory without geometry. Since x and y are independent, the joint probability distribution is uniform over the rectangle. So the probability that x < y is the double integral over the region x < y of the joint density function.

The joint density function is (1/3) for x (since x is uniform over [0,3]) and (1/4) for y (since y is uniform over [0,4]). So the joint density is (1/3)*(1/4) = 1/12.

So the probability P(x < y) is the integral over x from 0 to 3 and y from x to 4 of (1/12) dy dx.

Let me compute this:

First, for a given x, y ranges from x to 4. So the inner integral over y is from x to 4 of (1/12) dy, which is (1/12)*(4 - x).

Then, integrate this over x from 0 to 3:

∫ (from 0 to 3) (1/12)*(4 - x) dx

= (1/12) * ∫ (4 - x) dx from 0 to 3

Compute the integral:

∫4 dx = 4x

∫x dx = (1/2)x²

So ∫(4 - x) dx from 0 to 3 is [4*3 - (1/2)*3²] - [0 - 0] = (12 - 4.5) = 7.5

Multiply by (1/12):

7.5 * (1/12) = 7.5/12 = 0.625 = 5/8.

So that's the same result as before. Therefore, the probability is 5/8, which is option I.

Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes when dealing with different intervals, there might be another approach. For example, maybe considering the probability when y is in different ranges.

Another way to think about it: For each possible value of y, what's the probability that x < y?

Since y is between 0 and 4, and x is between 0 and 3, we can break this into cases:

1. When y is between 0 and 3: The probability that x < y is y/3, because x is uniform over [0,3].

2. When y is between 3 and 4: The probability that x < y is 3/3 = 1, because x can't exceed 3, and y is at least 3, so x will always be less than y in this case.

So, the total probability is the integral over y from 0 to 3 of (y/3) * (1/4) dy plus the integral over y from 3 to 4 of 1 * (1/4) dy.

Compute each part:

First integral: ∫ (y/3)*(1/4) dy from 0 to 3.

= (1/12) ∫ y dy from 0 to 3

= (1/12) * [ (1/2)y² ] from 0 to 3

= (1/12)*( (1/2)*9 - 0 )

= (1/12)*(9/2) = 9/24 = 3/8.

Second integral: ∫ 1*(1/4) dy from 3 to 4.

= (1/4)*(4 - 3) = (1/4)*1 = 1/4.

Adding both parts: 3/8 + 1/4 = 3/8 + 2/8 = 5/8.

Same result again. So yes, 5/8 is the correct probability, which is option I.
</think>

The probability that x < y is found by calculating the area where y > x within the rectangle [0,3] x [0,4]. This area is determined to be 7.5, leading to a probability of 5/8.
