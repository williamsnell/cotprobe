Alright, I need to figure out the correct answer to this question about Hobbes and Locke. I remember that both were philosophers who wrote about social contract theory, but their views differ in some key areas. Let's break down each option to see which one captures the principal difference.

Option A: They differ in their views about the necessity of a social contract. Wait, I think both Hobbes and Locke actually agree on the necessity of a social contract. Hobbes's Leviathan and Locke's Second Treatise both discuss the social contract, so this might not be the main difference.

Option B: They disagree about the role of law in society. Hmm, while both discuss law, I'm not sure if this is their main point of contention. I think their focus was more on the structure of government and the nature of human rights.

Option C: They have contrasting views on the role of religion in society. I'm not too sure about this one. I know that Locke wrote about religious tolerance, but I'm not certain if this is the principal difference.

Option D: They have different ideas about the importance of education. I don't recall education being a central point in their theories, so this might not be it.

Option E: They have different perspectives on economic policies. Again, I don't think their main focus was on economics. It was more about the state of nature and the formation of government.

Option F: They have opposing views about the nature of contractual obligations. This seems plausible. Hobbes might have a different view on what the contract entails compared to Locke. But I need to think more about this.

Option G: They differ in respect of their account of life before the social contract. This sounds more accurate. Hobbes describes life in the state of nature as "nasty, brutish, and short," while Locke's state of nature is more harmonious. So their accounts of life before society are different, which could be a key point.

Option H: They hold opposing views on the subject of individual rights. Yes, this is a big one. Hobbes believes in absolute sovereignty, which limits individual rights, whereas Locke emphasizes natural rights like life, liberty, and property. So this is a major difference.

Option I: They disagree on the structure and role of government in society. That's definitely true. Hobbes supports a strong, central authority ( Leviathan), while Locke advocates for a limited government with checks and balances.

Option J: They adopt different attitudes towards the role of the courts in maintaining order. I don't think this is their main point of contention. Their focus was more on the government's structure rather than the courts specifically.

Now, looking back, the question is about the principal difference. Both H and I seem important. The options are about which statement is closest to the main difference.

Hobbes and Locke differ on individual rights and the role of government. But which one is the primary point? The question is asking which statement is closest to the main difference. The social contract is a framework, but the nature of the government and individual rights stem from that.

Wait, the question is about the principal difference. I think the more fundamental difference is their views on the role of government and individual rights. So option H and I.

But looking at the options, option I says they disagree on the structure and role of government. Option H is about individual rights.

I think the principal difference is that Hobbes supports a strong, central government with less emphasis on individual rights, whereas Locke supports a government that protects individual rights with a system of checks and balances.

So the main difference is in their views on the role of government and individual rights. But the options H and I are both about these topics.

Wait, the question is which statement is the closest. Let me think again.

The question is about the principal difference. The key point is that Locke believes in natural rights (life, liberty, property) and limited government, while Hobbes believes in absolute sovereignty for the Leviathan to prevent the state of war. So the main difference is their view on the role of government and individual rights.

Looking at the options, option H is about individual rights, and option I is about the role and structure of government.

Which one is more fundamental? I think the structure of government is the broader issue, which encompasses the role of individual rights. But the principal difference is often phrased in terms of rights and government structure.

Wait, the question is about the principal difference. Maybe the main point is about the nature of the government they support. So option I, which talks about the structure and role of government, would be the answer. Alternatively, option H about individual rights is also a big difference.

Wait, the question asks which statement is closest to characterizing the principal difference. So perhaps the best answer is H, because the core of their disagreement is about individual rights versus Hobbes's view that rights are subordinate to the sovereign.

Alternatively, I might have to think about what each of their main arguments were. Hobbes's main point was the need for a strong government to prevent chaos, while Locke's was about the protection of natural rights.

So perhaps the main difference is in their views on individual rights (option H) and the role of government (option I). But the question is which statement is closer.

I think the principal difference is that Hobbes supports absolute sovereignty, whereas Locke supports limited government to protect individual rights. So the key difference is about individual rights and the structure of government.

But looking at the options, I need to pick the one that best captures this. Option H is about individual rights, and option I is about government structure.

I think the most accurate answer is H: They hold opposing views on the subject of individual rights. Because while both discuss government structure, the fundamental difference lies in their views on rights.

Wait, no, I think the primary difference is more about the role of government. Because Hobbes's Leviathan is about a strong central government, while Locke's is about a government that derives its power from the people and protects their rights. So the structure and role of government is the main point.

So perhaps the correct answer is I: They disagree on the structure and role of government in society.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because both H and I seem relevant. Let me check more carefully.

Hobbes believes in a social contract that gives absolute power to the sovereign to maintain order, whereas Locke believes in a contract that protects natural rights and allows for the possibility of revolution if the government fails to do so.

So the principal difference is about the role of government and individual rights. But the question is which statement captures this best.

Looking at the options, option H is about individual rights, and option I is about government structure.

I think the best answer is I because the structure and role of government is the broader issue that encompasses the rights aspect. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another angle: The principal difference is that Hobbes believes in a social contract that leads to a sovereign with absolute power, while Locke's contract leads to a government that protects individual rights. So the main difference is in their views on the role of government, not just individual rights.

Therefore, the correct answer is I: They disagree on the structure and role of government in society.

The principal difference between Hobbes and Locke lies in their views on the structure and role of government. Hobbes advocates for a strong, central authority to prevent chaos, while Locke supports a limited government that protects individual rights. This distinction encompasses their differing perspectives on individual rights and the formation of government, making the structure and role of government the closest characterization of their principal difference.
