Question:

Consider a computer system in which processes can request and release one or more resources. Once a process has been granted a resource, the process has exclusive use of that resource until it is released. If a process requests a resource that is already in use, the process enters a queue for that resource, waiting until the resource is available. Which of the following will NOT deal effectively with the problem of deadlock?

Options:

A: Giving priorities to processes and ordering the wait queues by priority
B: Numbering the resources and requiring that processes request resources in order of increasing number
C: Having a process request all its required resources when it first begins, and restarting if it cannot obtain them all
D: Allowing processes to request resources only in order of decreasing number

Okay, so I have this question about deadlocks in computer systems. I'm a bit rusty on my operating systems, but let me think through this.

The question is asking which option will NOT effectively deal with the problem of deadlock. Deadlock occurs when two or more processes are stuck waiting for resources that each other holds, leading to no progress. So the options are about different resource management strategies.

Option A: Giving priorities to processes and ordering the wait queues by priority. I remember that priority-based scheduling can help. If higher priority processes get their resources first, lower priority ones might not block as much. Maybe this helps prevent deadlocks because higher priority processes are less likely to get stuck waiting for a resource that a lower priority process is holding. So this might be a good way to avoid deadlocks.

Option B: Numbering resources and requiring processes to request them in increasing order. Oh right, this sounds like the resource ordering or numbering approach. I think this is called the "numbering" strategy. Processes request resources in a specific order, which reduces the chance of circular waits, a key cause of deadlocks. If all processes follow the order, they can't end up in a deadlock because no two processes would be waiting for each other's resources. So B seems like a good strategy to prevent deadlocks.

Option C: A process requests all required resources at the start and restarts if it can't get them all. This is the "one-time" or "all-or-nothing" approach. If a process needs multiple resources, it asks for them all right away. If any are unavailable, it releases everything and restarts. This method is actually designed to prevent deadlocks because it avoids the situation where a process is holding some resources while waiting for others. Since the process either gets everything or gives up, there's no partial allocation leading to deadlock. So C is a valid strategy.

Option D: Allowing processes to request resources only in order of decreasing number. Wait, that's the opposite of option B. If resources are numbered, say 1,2,3, and processes request them in decreasing order (like 3,2,1), does that help? I think this could lead to deadlocks. Because if process A is waiting for resource 3, and process B is waiting for resource 2 but has resource 3, and process C is waiting for resource 1 but has resource 2, this creates a circular dependency. So D might actually cause deadlocks because it doesn't follow the increasing order which breaks the deadlock possibility.

Wait, but in option B, processes request in increasing order, which prevents circular waits. In D, it's decreasing, which could allow circular waits. So D is the option that doesn't deal with deadlocks effectively because it can lead to deadlocks. So the answer should be D.

The question asks which option will NOT effectively deal with the problem of deadlock. Deadlock occurs when processes are stuck waiting for resources that others hold, preventing progress. 

- **Option A**: Prioritizing processes and ordering wait queues by priority can help prevent deadlocks by ensuring higher priority processes get resources first, reducing the likelihood of blocking.
- **Option B**: Requiring processes to request resources in increasing order of their numbers reduces circular waits, a key cause of deadlocks, thus preventing them.
- **Option C**: Requesting all required resources at the start and restarting if unavailable avoids partial resource allocation, which is a strategy to prevent deadlocks.
- **Option D**: Allowing processes to request resources in decreasing order can lead to circular dependencies, increasing the risk of deadlocks. This approach does not effectively prevent deadlocks.

The answer is D because it can lead to deadlocks by allowing circular resource requests.

Answer: D
