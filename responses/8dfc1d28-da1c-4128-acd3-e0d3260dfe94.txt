Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about jet engines and horsepower. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question says that each of the four jet engines on an Airbus A380 develops a thrust of 322,000 N. When the airplane is flying at 250 m/s, I need to find out how much horsepower each engine is developing. The options are given from A to J, with various horsepower values.

First, I remember that horsepower is a unit of power, which measures energy transfer per unit time. Power in physics is calculated by the formula Power = Force × Velocity. So, I think I need to calculate the power each engine is producing and then convert that into horsepower.

Wait, but each engine has a thrust of 322,000 N. So for one engine, the force is 322,000 N. The velocity given is 250 m/s. So the power per engine should be Force multiplied by velocity. That gives me the power in watts, right?

Let me do that calculation. So, 322,000 N multiplied by 250 m/s. Let me compute that: 322,000 * 250. Hmm, 322,000 times 200 is 64,400,000, and 322,000 times 50 is 16,100,000. Adding them together, 64,400,000 + 16,100,000 equals 80,500,000 watts. Wait, that can't be right because that's per engine. But wait, the question is about each engine's horsepower, so maybe I should proceed.

Wait, no, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me check again. 322,000 × 250. Let me break it down:

322,000 × 250 = 322,000 × (200 + 50) = (322,000 × 200) + (322,000 × 50). 

322,000 × 200 = 64,400,000.
322,000 × 50 = 16,100,000. 
Adding them gives 64,400,000 + 16,100,000 = 80,500,000 watts. So that's 80.5 million watts per engine? That seems high. Hmm, I think I should double-check because 80 million watts is 80 MW per engine, which seems a bit too much for a jet engine. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, no, perhaps I should consider that the total thrust is for all four engines, but the question is about each engine. Let me read the question again: "Each of the four jet engines... develops a thrust of 322,000 N." So each engine's thrust is 322,000 N. So the calculation is correct for each engine.

So each engine's power is 80.5 million watts. Now, I need to convert that into horsepower. I remember that 1 horsepower (hp) is approximately 745.7 watts. So, to find out how many horsepower that is, I divide the power in watts by 745.7.

So, 80,500,000 W ÷ 745.7 ≈ let me compute that.

First, let's approximate it. 745.7 is roughly 746. So 80,500,000 / 746.

Let me compute 80,500,000 divided by 746.

Hmm, 746 × 100,000 is 74,600,000. So subtract that from 80,500,000, we get 5,900,000 left.

746 × 7,900 ≈ 746 × 7,000 = 5,222,000; 746 × 900 = 671,400. So 5,222,000 + 671,400 = 5,893,400. That's close to 5,900,000. So 7,900 would give us about 5,893,400. So the total would be 100,000 + 7,900 ≈ 107,900 hp. 

Wait, so 80,500,000 W is about 107,900 hp. Looking at the options, E is 108,000, which is very close. So the answer should be E: 108,000 hp.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations because sometimes when I'm dividing, I might make a mistake.

Alternatively, I can compute 80,500,000 / 745.7 exactly.

Let me do this step by step.

First, 80,500,000 divided by 745.7.

Let me write this as 80,500,000 / 745.7 ≈ ?

I can approximate 745.7 as 700 for easier calculation. 80,500,000 ÷ 700 ≈ 115,000. But that's an underestimate because 745.7 is larger than 700. So the actual value should be less than 115,000. Wait, perhaps I should do it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use calculator-like steps.

Let me see: 745.7 × 100,000 = 74,570,000.

Subtracting this from 80,500,000 gives 5,930,000.

Now, how many times does 745.7 go into 5,930,000?

Compute 5,930,000 ÷ 745.7 ≈ let's see.

Well, 745.7 × 7,900 = let me compute 745.7 × 7000 = 5,219,900.

745.7 × 900 = 671,130.

So 7000+900=7900, and 5,219,900 + 671,130 = 5,891,030.

That's close to 5,930,000. The difference is 5,930,000 - 5,891,030 = 38,970.

Now, how much more is that? 38,970 ÷ 745.7 ≈ about 52.24.

So total is 100,000 + 7,900 + 52.24 ≈ 107,952.24 hp.

So approximately 107,952 hp. Looking at the options, E is 108,000, which is the closest. So the answer should be E.

The power per engine is calculated using the formula Power = Force × Velocity. Each engine's thrust is 322,000 N, and the velocity is 250 m/s, giving a power of 80,500,000 W. Converting this to horsepower (1 hp ≈ 745.7 W), the result is approximately 107,952 hp. The closest option is E: 108,000 hp.
