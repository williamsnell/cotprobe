Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about plane mirrors. Hmm, let me think. The question is: An object is placed 100 cm from a plane mirror. How far is the image from the object? The options are A through J, with various centimeter measurements.

Alright, I remember that plane mirrors create images that are virtual and upright. But wait, what about the distance? I think the image distance from the mirror is the same as the object distance. So if the object is 100 cm away, the image should also be 100 cm on the other side of the mirror.

Wait, but the question isn't asking how far the image is from the mirror. It's asking how far the image is from the object. Oh right, because the object and image are on opposite sides of the mirror. So the total distance between the object and its image would be the sum of their distances from the mirror.

So object is 100 cm from the mirror, image is also 100 cm from the mirror. So the total distance between them would be 100 + 100 = 200 cm. That makes sense. So the image is 200 cm away from the object.

Looking at the options, J is 200 cm. So that should be the correct answer.

The image formed by a plane mirror is virtual, upright, and the same distance from the mirror as the object. Since the object is 100 cm from the mirror, the image is also 100 cm on the opposite side. Therefore, the image is 200 cm away from the object.

Answer: J
