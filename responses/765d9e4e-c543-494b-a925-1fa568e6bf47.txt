Okay, so I have this problem where I need to evaluate the line integral ∫C F · dr using Stokes' Theorem. The vector field F is given as F(x, y, z) = xy i + yz j + zx k. The curve C is a triangle with vertices at (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1), oriented counterclockwise when viewed from above.

Hmm, Stokes' Theorem relates a line integral around a closed curve to the surface integral of the curl of the vector field over the surface bounded by the curve. The theorem states that ∫C F · dr = ∫∫S curl F · dS, where S is a surface bounded by C.

First, I should compute the curl of F. Let me recall that the curl is the determinant of a matrix with partial derivatives. So, curl F = ∇ × F.

Given F = (xy, yz, zx), let's compute each component of the curl.

The curl formula is:

curl F = ( ∂F_z/∂y - ∂F_y/∂z ) i + ( ∂F_x/∂z - ∂F_z/∂x ) j + ( ∂F_y/∂x - ∂F_x/∂y ) k.

Let's compute each part:

First component (i):
∂F_z/∂y = ∂(zx)/∂y = 0, since zx doesn't depend on y.
∂F_y/∂z = ∂(yz)/∂z = y.
So, ∂F_z/∂y - ∂F_y/∂z = 0 - y = -y.

Second component (j):
∂F_x/∂z = ∂(xy)/∂z = 0, since xy doesn't depend on z.
∂F_z/∂x = ∂(zx)/∂x = z.
So, ∂F_x/∂z - ∂F_z/∂x = 0 - z = -z.

Third component (k):
∂F_y/∂x = ∂(yz)/∂x = 0, since yz doesn't depend on x.
∂F_x/∂y = ∂(xy)/∂y = x.
So, ∂F_y/∂x - ∂F_x/∂y = 0 - x = -x.

Putting it all together, curl F = (-y, -z, -x).

Wait, let me double-check that. So for the i component, it's ∂F_z/∂y - ∂F_y/∂z. F_z is zx, so ∂F_z/∂y is 0. F_y is yz, so ∂F_y/∂z is y. So 0 - y is -y. That's correct.

Similarly, j component: ∂F_x/∂z is 0 (since F_x is xy which is independent of z), and ∂F_z/∂x is z. So 0 - z is -z. Correct.

k component: ∂F_y/∂x is 0, and ∂F_x/∂y is x. So 0 - x is -x. Yep, so curl F is (-y, -z, -x).

Now, according to Stokes' Theorem, I can compute the surface integral of curl F over the surface S, which is the triangle C. But what surface should I choose? Since the curve is a triangle in 3D space, I can choose any surface bounded by this triangle. A natural choice is the triangle itself, lying in the plane defined by the three points.

Wait, but the triangle is in 3D space, so I need to parameterize it or find its normal vector. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the flux integral using the formula.

The surface integral ∫∫S curl F · dS can be computed by finding the normal vector to the surface S and expressing dS in terms of dx dy or similar. Since S is a flat triangle, its normal vector is constant over the surface.

Let me find the equation of the plane containing the triangle. The three points are (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1). Let's find two vectors in the plane:

Vector a = (0,1,0) - (1,0,0) = (-1,1,0)
Vector b = (0,0,1) - (1,0,0) = (-1,0,1)

The cross product of a and b will give the normal vector.

Compute a × b:
a = (-1, 1, 0)
b = (-1, 0, 1)
Cross product:

i (1*1 - 0*0) - j (-1*1 - 0*(-1)) + k (-1*0 - 1*(-1))
= i (1) - j (-1) + k (1)
= (1, 1, 1)

So the normal vector is (1,1,1). But wait, the orientation matters. The curve is oriented counterclockwise when viewed from above, so the normal vector should point upwards. Let me check the direction.

Looking from above, the normal vector should have a positive z-component. Since (1,1,1) has a positive z-component, that's correct. So the normal vector n is (1,1,1)/|n|. But for the flux integral, I can use the vector n without normalization since we're integrating over the surface, and the scaling will come into play when computing the magnitude.

Alternatively, since the surface is flat, I can parametrize it and compute the flux integral.

But maybe it's easier to compute the flux integral using the formula ∫∫S curl F · dS = ∫∫D curl F · (n) dA, where D is the projection of S onto some coordinate plane, and n is the unit normal vector.

Wait, but perhaps there's a smarter way. Since the surface is a triangle, maybe I can find its area and then compute the flux accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for flux through a flat surface, which can be computed as the double integral over the projected region multiplied by the normal component.

But wait, perhaps I can compute the flux integral by parameterizing the surface.

Let me try to parametrize the triangle. Let me choose two parameters, say u and v, such that the points are expressed as a combination of the vertices.

Alternatively, since the triangle is in 3D space, maybe it's easier to compute the flux using the formula involving the normal vector and the curl evaluated at the projection.

Wait, but perhaps a more straightforward approach is to compute the flux integral directly. Let me think.

Given that the surface is a flat triangle, and the normal vector is (1,1,1), I can compute the flux as the integral over the surface of (curl F) · n dS, where n is the unit normal.

But perhaps it's easier to compute the flux using the formula:

∫∫S (curl F) · dS = ∫∫D (curl F) · (r_u × r_v) du dv,

where r(u,v) parametrizes the surface. But that might get complicated.

Alternatively, since the surface is flat, the flux can be found by taking the dot product of the curl evaluated at any point on the surface with the normal vector, multiplied by the area of the surface. But wait, that's only true if the curl is constant over the surface, which it isn't in this case. So that approach won't work.

Hmm, maybe I should instead parametrize the triangle.

Let me try. Let's denote the three vertices as A(1,0,0), B(0,1,0), and C(0,0,1). The triangle can be parametrized using two parameters, say u and v, such that any point on the triangle can be expressed as A + u*(B - A) + v*(C - A), where u ≥ 0, v ≥ 0, and u + v ≤ 1.

So, B - A = (-1,1,0), and C - A = (-1,0,1).

Thus, the parametrization r(u,v) = A + u*(B - A) + v*(C - A) = (1,0,0) + u*(-1,1,0) + v*(-1,0,1) = (1 - u - v, u, v), where u ≥ 0, v ≥ 0, u + v ≤ 1.

Now, to compute the flux integral, I need to find the cross product of the partial derivatives of r with respect to u and v, which will give a vector normal to the surface.

Compute r_u = ∂r/∂u = (-1, 1, 0)
Compute r_v = ∂r/∂v = (-1, 0, 1)
Then, r_u × r_v is the cross product:

i (1*1 - 0*0) - j (-1*1 - 0*(-1)) + k (-1*0 - 1*(-1))
= i (1) - j (-1) + k (1)
= (1, 1, 1)

So, the cross product is (1,1,1), as we found earlier.

Now, the flux integral becomes ∫∫D (curl F(r(u,v))) · (r_u × r_v) du dv, where D is the domain in the uv-plane: u ≥ 0, v ≥ 0, u + v ≤ 1.

But curl F is (-y, -z, -x). Let's express y, z, x in terms of u and v using the parametrization r(u,v) = (1 - u - v, u, v).

So, x = 1 - u - v
y = u
z = v

Thus, curl F = (-y, -z, -x) = (-u, -v, -(1 - u - v)) = (-u, -v, -1 + u + v).

Now, the integrand is (curl F) · (r_u × r_v) = (-u, -v, -1 + u + v) · (1,1,1).

Compute the dot product:

(-u)*1 + (-v)*1 + (-1 + u + v)*1
= -u - v -1 + u + v
= (-u + u) + (-v + v) -1
= 0 + 0 -1 = -1.

So the integrand simplifies to -1.

Therefore, the flux integral becomes ∫∫D (-1) du dv. The domain D is the triangle in the uv-plane with vertices (0,0), (1,0), and (0,1). So the area of D is 0.5.

Thus, the integral is -1 * area of D = -1 * (1/2) = -1/2.

Wait, but hold on. The integral over D is ∫∫D (-1) du dv = (-1) * ∫∫D du dv = (-1) * (Area of D).

The area of D is 0.5, so the integral is (-1) * 0.5 = -0.5, which is -1/2.

But wait, according to Stokes' Theorem, the line integral is equal to the flux integral of the curl through the surface S. So ∫C F · dr = ∫∫S curl F · dS = -1/2.

Wait, but the answer options include -1/2 as option A. So the answer should be A: -1/2.

But let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Computed curl F correctly? Yes, got (-y, -z, -x).

2. Parametrized the surface correctly? Yes, using u and v, got r(u,v) = (1 - u - v, u, v).

3. Computed r_u and r_v correctly? Yes, (-1,1,0) and (-1,0,1).

4. Cross product r_u × r_v is (1,1,1). Correct.

5. Expressed curl F in terms of u and v: (-u, -v, -1 + u + v). Correct.

6. Dot product with (1,1,1) gives (-u -v -1 + u + v) = -1. Correct.

7. Integral over D is -1 * area of D, which is -1 * (1/2) = -1/2. So the line integral is -1/2, which is option A.

Wait, but I also need to make sure about the orientation. The problem states the curve is oriented counterclockwise when viewed from above. The normal vector we found was (1,1,1), which points upwards, consistent with the right-hand rule. So the orientation is correct.

Another way to think about this is that the surface is oriented with the normal vector pointing upwards, which matches the given orientation of the curve. So everything looks consistent.

Therefore, the answer should be A: -1/2.

To evaluate the line integral ∫C F · dr using Stokes' Theorem, we first compute the curl of the vector field F(x, y, z) = xy i + yz j + zx k. The curl is calculated as:

curl F = (-y, -z, -x).

Next, we consider the surface S bounded by the curve C, which is the triangle with vertices (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1). The normal vector to the surface is found using the cross product of two vectors lying on the plane of the triangle, resulting in (1,1,1). 

Using Stokes' Theorem, the line integral is equal to the flux integral of the curl through the surface S. We parametrize the surface and compute the flux integral, finding that the integrand simplifies to -1. Integrating over the triangular domain yields a result of -1/2. 

Thus, the line integral evaluates to -1/2.
