Okay, so I need to find the area bounded by the curves y = cos x and y = cos²x between x = 0 and x = π. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that to find the area between two curves, I should integrate the top function minus the bottom function over the interval where they intersect. So, I should probably find where these two curves intersect between 0 and π.

Wait, but cos²x is always non-negative, just like cos x, but since cos x can be negative, I need to be careful. Let me sketch the graphs mentally. Cos x starts at 1 when x=0, goes down to -1 at π. Cos²x is always positive, starting at 1, going down to 0 at π/2, then back up to 1 at π.

Wait, but wait, cos²x is (cos x)^2. So when cos x is positive, both functions are positive, but when cos x is negative, cos²x is positive, so the curves might cross somewhere.

Wait, let me find the points where cos x and cos²x are equal. So set cos x = cos²x.

So cos x = cos²x => cos²x - cos x = 0 => cos x (cos x -1) = 0.

So solutions are when cos x = 0 or cos x =1. Cos x=1 at x=0, and cos x=0 at x=π/2. So the curves intersect at x=0 and x=π/2. Hmm, because between 0 and π/2, cos x is positive, so cos²x is cos x squared, which is less than cos x because for 0 < x < π/2, cos x is between 0 and 1, so squaring it makes it smaller. So cos x is above cos²x in that interval.

But wait, wait, let me check at x=0: both are 1, yes. At x=π/2: cos(π/2)=0, cos²(π/2)=0, so they meet there. But what about beyond π/2? From π/2 to π, cos x is negative, so cos²x is positive. So cos²x is positive, and cos x is negative. So in this interval, cos²x is above cos x because cos x is negative. So the area would consist of two parts: from 0 to π/2, cos x is above cos²x, and from π/2 to π, cos²x is above cos x.

So the total area would be the integral from 0 to π/2 of (cos x - cos²x) dx plus the integral from π/2 to π of (cos²x - cos x) dx.

Wait, but wait, from π/2 to π, cos x is negative, so cos²x is positive, so cos²x is definitely above cos x there. So yes, that makes sense.

So the area A is the sum of these two integrals.

Let me compute each integral separately.

First integral: from 0 to π/2 of (cos x - cos²x) dx.

Second integral: from π/2 to π of (cos²x - cos x) dx.

Let me compute the first integral:

Integral of cos x dx is sin x.

Integral of cos²x dx: I remember that cos²x can be rewritten using the double-angle identity: cos²x = (1 + cos 2x)/2. So the integral becomes (1/2)x + (1/4) sin 2x.

So putting it together, the first integral from 0 to π/2 is:

[sin x - ( (1/2)x + (1/4) sin 2x ) ] evaluated from 0 to π/2.

At π/2:

sin(π/2) = 1

(1/2)(π/2) = π/4

sin(2*(π/2)) = sin(π) = 0

So the first part at π/2 is 1 - (π/4 + 0) = 1 - π/4.

At 0:

sin(0) = 0

(1/2)(0) = 0

sin(0) = 0

So total for the first integral is (1 - π/4) - 0 = 1 - π/4.

Now the second integral from π/2 to π of (cos²x - cos x) dx.

Again, using the same approach:

Integral of cos²x dx is (1/2)x + (1/4) sin 2x.

Integral of cos x dx is sin x.

So the integral is [ (1/2)x + (1/4) sin 2x - sin x ] evaluated from π/2 to π.

At x=π:

(1/2)(π) = π/2

sin(2π) = 0

sin π = 0

So at π, the value is π/2 + 0 - 0 = π/2.

At x=π/2:

(1/2)(π/2) = π/4

sin(2*(π/2)) = sin π = 0

sin(π/2) = 1

So at π/2, the value is π/4 + 0 - 1 = π/4 - 1.

So the second integral is [π/2] - [π/4 -1] = π/2 - π/4 +1 = π/4 +1.

Wait, let me make sure. The integral from a to b is F(b) - F(a). So it's [π/2] - [π/4 -1] = π/2 - π/4 +1 = (π/4) +1.

So the total area A is the sum of the first integral and the second:

A = (1 - π/4) + (π/4 +1) = 1 - π/4 + π/4 +1 = 2.

Wait, that can't be right because 2 is one of the options, option J.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

First integral: 0 to π/2, (cos x - cos²x) dx.

Compute integral:

= [sin x - ( (1/2)x + (1/4) sin 2x ) ] from 0 to π/2.

At π/2:

sin(π/2) = 1

(1/2)(π/2) = π/4

sin(2*(π/2)) = sin(π) = 0

So 1 - (π/4 + 0) = 1 - π/4.

At 0:

0 - (0 + 0) = 0.

So first integral is 1 - π/4.

Second integral: π/2 to π, (cos²x - cos x) dx.

= [ (1/2)x + (1/4) sin 2x - sin x ] from π/2 to π.

At π:

(1/2)(π) = π/2

sin(2π)=0

sin π=0

So value is π/2 + 0 - 0 = π/2.

At π/2:

(1/2)(π/2) = π/4

sin(2*(π/2)) = sin π = 0

sin(π/2) =1

So value is π/4 + 0 -1 = π/4 -1.

So the integral is π/2 - (π/4 -1) = π/2 - π/4 +1 = π/4 +1.

Adding both integrals:

(1 - π/4) + (π/4 +1) = 1 - π/4 + π/4 +1 = 2.

Wait, that gives area A = 2. But let me think again: from π/2 to π, cos x is negative, so cos²x is positive, so the area should be the integral of cos²x - cos x, which is positive in that interval. So adding both integrals gives 2.

Looking back at the options, J is 2. So the answer should be J.

The area bounded by the curves \( y = \cos x \) and \( y = \cos^2 x \) between \( x = 0 \) and \( x = \pi \) is calculated by integrating the difference between the upper and lower functions over the intervals where they intersect. The curves intersect at \( x = 0 \) and \( x = \pi/2 \). From \( 0 \) to \( \pi/2 \), \( \cos x \) is above \( \cos^2 x \), and from \( \pi/2 \) to \( \pi \), \( \cos^2 x \) is above \( \cos x \). The total area is the sum of the integrals over these intervals:

\[
\text{Area} = \int_0^{\pi/2} (\cos x - \cos^2 x) \, dx + \int_{\pi/2}^{\pi} (\cos^2 x - \cos x) \, dx
\]

Using the double-angle identity \( \cos^2 x = \frac{1 + \cos 2x}{2} \), the integrals are computed, and the result is \( 2 \).
