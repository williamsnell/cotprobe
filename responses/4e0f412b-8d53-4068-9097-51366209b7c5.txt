Okay, so I've got this question about the magnifying power of a microscope. I'm a bit rusty on my optics, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question gives me the length of the microscope tube, which is 10 centimeters. Then it mentions the focal lengths of the objective and the eyepiece. The objective has a focal length of 0.5 centimeters, and the eyepiece has 2 centimeters. I need to find the magnifying power.

Wait, I remember that magnifying power in a microscope is calculated with a specific formula. I think it's something like the magnification (M) equals the ratio of the focal lengths of the eyepiece to the objective, multiplied by something else. Oh right, there's also the length of the tube involved. 

So I think the formula is M = (Fe / Fo) * (L / Fe), but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, maybe it's M = (Fe / Fo) * (L / (Fe + Fo))? No, that doesn't sound right. Or perhaps it's M = (Fe / Fo) * (L / (L - Fe))? Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall.

Wait, I think the formula is M = (Fe / Fo) * (L / Fe). Because the magnifying power comes from the combination of the objective and the eyepiece. The objective's magnification is about the angular size, and the eyepiece contributes another factor based on the focal lengths and the tube length.

Wait, another approach: the magnifying power of a microscope is given by M = (Fe / Fo) * (L / Fe). Wait, that would simplify to M = L / Fo, but that can't be right because Fe is in both numerator and denominator.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is M = (Fe / Fo) * (L / (L - Fe - Fo))? Or maybe M = (Fe / Fo) * (L / (L - Fe))? I'm getting more confused now. Maybe I should look for the standard formula.

Wait, I think I remember that the formula for the magnifying power (M) of a microscope is M = (Fe / Fo) * (L / Fe). So, let me plug in the numbers.

Wait, Fe is the eyepiece focal length, which is 2 cm. Fo is the objective's, 0.5 cm. Tube length L is 10 cm.

So, substituting, M = (2 cm / 0.5 cm) * (10 cm / 2 cm). Let me compute that.

First, 2 divided by 0.5 is 4. Then, 10 divided by 2 is 5. So 4 multiplied by 5 is 20. So M would be 20. Looking at the options, option G is 20. So is that the answer?

Wait, but wait a second. I'm not sure if I've got the formula right. Maybe it's M = (Fe / Fo) * (L / (L - Fe))? Let's try that. So Fe is 2, Fo is 0.5, L is 10.

So Fe/Fo is 4 again. Then L/(L-Fe) is 10/(10-2) = 10/8 = 1.25. Then 4 * 1.25 is 5. That's not an option, so that can't be right.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is M = (Fe / Fo) multiplied by (L / Fo). Wait, that would be (2/0.5) * (10/0.5) = 4 * 20 = 80. No, that's not an option either.

Wait, maybe I should think about the standard formula for a microscope's magnifying power. I think the correct formula is M = (Fe / Fo) * (L / Fe) = (Fe / Fo) * (L / Fe) = (Fe * L) / (Fo * Fe) )? No, that cancels out. Wait, maybe it's M = (Fe / Fo) * (L / (Fe)) = (L / Fo) * (Fe/Fe) = L/Fo. So L is 10 cm, Fo is 0.5 cm. 10/0.5 is 20. So M would be 20. So option G.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes the formula is M = (Fe / Fo) * ( (L) / (Fe) ). So that's (2/0.5) * (10/2) = 4 *5 =20. So again, 20.

Yes, that seems to fit. So the answer should be 20, which is option G.

The magnifying power \( M \) of a microscope is calculated using the formula:

\[
M = \left( \frac{F_e}{F_o} \right) \times \left( \frac{L}{F_e} \right)
\]

where:
- \( F_e \) is the focal length of the eyepiece (2 cm),
- \( F_o \) is the focal length of the objective (0.5 cm),
- \( L \) is the length of the microscope tube (10 cm).

Substituting the given values:

\[
M = \left( \frac{2}{0.5} \right) \times \left( \frac{10}{2} \right) = 4 \times 5 = 20
\]

Thus, the magnifying power of the microscope is 20.
