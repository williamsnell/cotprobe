Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about two statements related to machine learning models, specifically ResNets and CIFAR-10. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think carefully.

Let's break down the question. There are two statements, and I need to evaluate each one as true or false. The options are combinations of these evaluations.

Statement 1: As of 2020, some models attain greater than 98% accuracy on CIFAR-10.

I remember that CIFAR-10 is a common dataset used for image classification, consisting of 10 classes and 60,000 32x32 color images. I know that deep learning models, especially CNNs, have been achieving high accuracies on this dataset. From what I've read, models like ResNet, Inception, and others have been pushing the boundaries. I think that as of 2020, top models were getting around 98% or even higher. For example, I recall that some models using techniques like data augmentation, batch normalization, and advanced architectures were achieving over 98%. So Statement 1 seems true.

Statement 2: The original ResNets were not optimized with the Adam optimizer.

ResNets, introduced by He et al., were a breakthrough. I remember they used specific optimizers. I think they originally used SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) with momentum, not Adam. Adam became more popular later because it often requires less tuning and can converge faster. So the original ResNets did not use Adam; they used SGD. Therefore, Statement 2 is true.

Now, looking at the options:

A: False, False → Both statements false. Not the case.

B: Both statements somewhat true → Maybe if the first is true and the second is true, but I'm not sure if 'somewhat' applies. Wait, no, if both are true, that's option G.

C: False, True → No, because Statement 1 is true.

D: Statement 1 true, 2 somewhat false → No, I think Statement 2 is definitely true.

E: Statement 1 false, 2 mostly true → No, because Statement 1 is true.

F: Statement 1 mostly true, Statement 2 false → No, both are true.

G: True, True → This seems correct.

H: Both somewhat false → No.

I: True, False → No.

J: 1 mostly false, 2 true → No.

Wait, maybe I should double-check. Did ResNets use Adam? From what I remember, the original ResNet papers used SGD with momentum and possibly other parameters. Adam was introduced earlier, but maybe wasn't the default choice for ResNets in their initial versions. So Statement 2 is correct.

So the correct evaluation is both statements are true. Therefore, the answer should be G: True, True.
</think>

The evaluation of both statements is true. Statement 1 is true because models like ResNet achieved over 98% accuracy on CIFAR-10 by 2020. Statement 2 is true because the original ResNets used SGD with momentum, not Adam.

G: True, True

The answer is G.
