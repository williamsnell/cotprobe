Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I need to find the change in enthalpy, ΔH, for a sample of CO₂. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, the problem states that we have 2.0 moles of CO₂ in a fixed volume of 15.0 dm³ at 300 K. Then, 2.35 kJ of heat is supplied, and the temperature increases to 341 K. We're told to use the van der Waals equation of state for CO₂ and calculate ΔH.

Wait, but hold on. The van der Waals equation is usually for real gases, right? So since CO₂ is a real gas, we need to use that equation instead of the ideal gas law. Hmm, but calculating enthalpy change with the van der Waals equation... I'm a bit confused here. Because enthalpy change for an ideal gas depends only on temperature, but for a real gas, it might depend on pressure and volume changes too. 

But wait, the problem says the volume is fixed. So the process is at constant volume. Oh, right, because the volume doesn't change. So the process is isochoric, which means q (heat) is equal to ΔU (change in internal energy), since for constant volume, work done is zero (no expansion work). So Q = ΔU.

But the question is about ΔH, not ΔU. So I'll need to relate ΔU to ΔH. I remember that ΔH = ΔU + Δ(PV). But since the volume is constant, Δ(PV) = VΔP. So ΔH = ΔU + VΔP.

So first, I need to find ΔU, which is Q (since V is constant), and then find ΔH by adding V times the change in pressure. Or wait, maybe I can approach this differently. Alternatively, since the process is at constant volume, maybe I can find the pressure changes and use the van der Waals equation to find the pressure at initial and final states, then compute ΔH accordingly.

Let me outline the steps I think I should take:

1. Use the van der Waals equation to find the initial and final pressures of CO₂ at the given temperatures and fixed volume.
2. Calculate the change in pressure, ΔP.
3. Compute ΔU as Q, which is 2.35 kJ.
4. Compute ΔH using ΔH = ΔU + VΔP. But wait, the volume is in dm³, which is liters, so I need to convert that to m³ if necessary, but since pressure is in bar or atm, maybe it's better to keep the units consistent.

Wait, the van der Waals equation is (P + a(n/V)^2)(V/n - b) = RT. So I can rearrange that to solve for P. Let me write that down:

P = [RT/(V/n - b)] - a(n/V)^2.

Wait, but I don't have the van der Waals constants for CO₂. Oh, right, I need to look them up. I think for CO₂, a is about 3.597 (in L^2·bar/mol^2) and b is 0.043 (in L/mol). Wait, let me confirm that. Alternatively, sometimes the constants are given in different units, so I should double-check. Alternatively, maybe I can find them from standard tables. Let me assume a = 3.597 L²·bar/mol² and b = 0.0427 L/mol. I think that's correct, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me proceed with these values.

So, given n = 2.0 mol, V = 15.0 dm³ = 15.0 L, T initial is 300 K, and final is 341 K. So I can compute P_initial and P_final.

Let me compute P_initial first. Let's plug into the equation:

P = [R T/( (V/n) - b ) ] - a (n/V)^2.

Wait, R is the gas constant. In terms of bar and L, R is 0.08314 L·bar/(mol·K). So R = 0.08314 L·bar/mol/K.

So for initial conditions (T1=300 K), let's compute each term.

First, compute (V/n) - b. V is 15 L, n=2, so V/n = 15/2 = 7.5 L/mol. Subtracting b (0.0427 L/mol) gives 7.5 - 0.0427 = 7.4573 L/mol.

Now, RT = 0.08314 * 300 = 24.942 L·bar/mol.

So [RT/(V/n - b)] = 24.942 / 7.4573 ≈ let's compute that. Let's see, 7.4573 is approximately 7.457. So 24.942 ÷ 7.457 ≈ 3.345 bar.

Now, the second term is a*(n/V)^2. a is 3.597 L²·bar/mol². n/V is 2/(15) ≈ 0.1333 mol/L. Squared is (0.1333)^2 ≈ 0.01777 mol²/L².

So a*(n/V)^2 = 3.597 * 0.01777 ≈ let's compute 3.597 * 0.01777. 3.597 * 0.017 is about 0.06115, and 3.597 * 0.00077 is about 0.00277. So total ≈ 0.0639 bar.

So initial pressure P1 = 3.345 bar - 0.0639 bar ≈ 3.281 bar.

Now, let's compute P_final at T2=341 K.

Same process:

(V/n) = 15/2 = 7.5 L/mol. Subtract b=0.0427 → 7.4573 L/mol.

RT = 0.08314 * 341 ≈ let's calculate that. 0.08314 * 300 = 24.942, 0.08314 * 41 ≈ 3.41276, so total RT ≈ 24.942 + 3.41276 ≈ 28.35476 L·bar/mol.

[RT/(V/n -b)] = 28.35476 / 7.4573 ≈ let's compute. 7.4573 * 3.8 = approx 28.337 (since 7.4573 * 3 =22.3719, 7.4573*0.8=5.96584; total ≈28.337). So 28.35476 ÷7.4573 ≈ approximately 3.807 bar.

Now the second term a*(n/V)^2 is same as before, because n, V are same, so it's still 0.0639 bar.

So P2 = 3.807 - 0.0639 ≈ 3.743 bar.

So change in pressure ΔP = P2 - P1 = 3.743 - 3.281 ≈ 0.462 bar.

Now, V is 15.0 dm³, which is 15.0 L. So VΔP would be 15 L * 0.462 bar. But we need to make sure the units are correct for ΔH, which is in kJ.

Wait, I think ΔH = ΔU + VΔP. Since ΔU is 2.35 kJ, and VΔP is in bar·L. How do I convert that to kJ?

Because 1 bar·L is equal to 100 J, since 1 bar = 100 kPa, and 1 kPa·m³ = 1 kJ. So 1 bar·L = 1 bar * 0.001 m³ = (10^5 Pa) * 0.001 m³ = 100 J. So 1 bar·L = 0.1 kJ.

So VΔP = 15 L * 0.462 bar = 15 * 0.462 = 6.93 bar·L. Converting to kJ: 6.93 * 0.1 = 0.693 kJ.

So ΔH = ΔU + VΔP = 2.35 kJ + 0.693 kJ ≈ 3.043 kJ.

Looking at the options, option H is +3.03 kJ, which is very close. So I think that's the answer.

Wait, let me just double-check my calculations for any possible mistakes.

First, checking the van der Waals constants: a=3.597 L²·bar/mol², b=0.0427 L/mol. I think these are correct.

Calculations for P1:

(V/n) = 15/2 =7.5 L/mol. Subtract b: 7.5 -0.0427=7.4573 L/mol.

RT at 300 K: 0.08314 *300=24.942 L·bar/mol.

[RT/(V/n -b)] =24.942 /7.4573 ≈3.345 bar.

a*(n/V)^2: (2/15)^2= (0.1333)^2=0.01777. 3.597 *0.01777≈0.0639 bar.

P1=3.345 -0.0639=3.2811 bar. Correct.

P2 at 341 K:

RT=0.08314*341≈28.355 L·bar/mol.

[RT/(V/n -b)]=28.355 /7.4573≈3.807 bar.

a term same as before, 0.0639 bar.

P2=3.807 -0.0639=3.7431 bar.

ΔP=3.7431-3.2811=0.462 bar.

VΔP=15 *0.462=6.93 bar·L → 0.693 kJ.

ΔH=2.35 +0.693=3.043 kJ. Rounded to 3.04 kJ, so option H is 3.03 kJ. Close enough, considering rounding during calculations.

So the answer should be H: +3.03 kJ.

To calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the given CO₂ sample, we proceed as follows:

1. **Use the van der Waals equation** to find the initial and final pressures at constant volume.
   - The van der Waals equation is:  
     \[
     P = \frac{RT}{\left(\frac{V}{n} - b\right)} - a\left(\frac{n}{V}\right)^2
     \]
   - Constants for CO₂: \(a = 3.597 \, \text{L}^2 \cdot \text{bar/mol}^2\), \(b = 0.0427 \, \text{L/mol}\).
   - \(R = 0.08314 \, \text{L·bar/(mol·K)}\), \(n = 2.0 \, \text{mol}\), \(V = 15.0 \, \text{L}\).

2. **Calculate initial pressure (\(P_1\)) at \(T_1 = 300 \, \text{K}\):**
   - \(\frac{V}{n} = \frac{15.0}{2.0} = 7.5 \, \text{L/mol}\),  
     \(\frac{V}{n} - b = 7.5 - 0.0427 = 7.4573 \, \text{L/mol}\).
   - \(RT = 0.08314 \cdot 300 = 24.942 \, \text{L·bar/mol}\),  
     \(\frac{RT}{\frac{V}{n} - b} = \frac{24.942}{7.4573} \approx 3.345 \, \text{bar}\).
   - \(a\left(\frac{n}{V}\right)^2 = 3.597 \cdot \left(\frac{2.0}{15.0}\right)^2 \approx 0.0639 \, \text{bar}\).
   - \(P_1 = 3.345 - 0.0639 \approx 3.281 \, \text{bar}\).

3. **Calculate final pressure (\(P_2\)) at \(T_2 = 341 \, \text{K}\):**
   - \(RT = 0.08314 \cdot 341 \approx 28.355 \, \text{L·bar/mol}\),  
     \(\frac{RT}{\frac{V}{n} - b} = \frac{28.355}{7.4573} \approx 3.807 \, \text{bar}\).
   - \(a\left(\frac{n}{V}\right)^2 = 0.0639 \, \text{bar}\) (same as initial).
   - \(P_2 = 3.807 - 0.0639 \approx 3.743 \, \text{bar}\).

4. **Determine the pressure change (\(\Delta P\)):**
   - \(\Delta P = P_2 - P_1 = 3.743 - 3.281 \approx 0.462 \, \text{bar}\).

5. **Relate ΔH to ΔU and Δ(PV):**
   - Since the process is at constant volume, \(\Delta U = Q = 2.35 \, \text{kJ}\).
   - \(\Delta H = \Delta U + V \Delta P\), where \(V = 15.0 \, \text{L}\).
   - Convert \(V \Delta P\) to kJ:  
     \(15.0 \cdot 0.462 = 6.93 \, \text{bar·L} = 0.693 \, \text{kJ}\) (since \(1 \, \text{bar·L} = 0.1 \, \text{kJ}\)).
   - \(\Delta H = 2.35 + 0.693 \approx 3.043 \, \text{kJ}\).

6. **Select the closest option:**
   - The calculated ΔH is approximately \(3.04 \, \text{kJ}\), which matches option **H: +3.03 kJ**.
