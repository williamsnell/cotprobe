Okay, so I have this question about Nagel and his view on absolutism. I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy, but let me try to think this through.

I remember that Nagel is a contemporary philosopher, known for his work in ethics and the philosophy of mind. The question is about his clarification of what absolutism is. From what I recall, absolutism in ethics refers to a stance where certain moral principles are considered to be absolutely binding, regardless of the situation. So, they're not subject to exceptions and must be followed in all cases.

The question is asking what Nagel says about absolutism in relation to preventing murder. The options are A through I, each giving a different stance on when to prevent or encourage murder.

Let's break down the options:

A: only sometimes prevent murder
B: never prevent murder
C: only sometimes avoid murder
D: always encourage murder
E: consider murder as a last resort
F: encourage murder under certain circumstances
G: only sometimes encourage murder
H: avoid murder except in self-defense situations
I: avoid murder at all costs

So, the key here is understanding Nagel's take on absolutism regarding murder. If absolutism is the view that certain principles must always be followed, then in the context of murder, preventing murder would be an absolute duty.

Option B says "never prevent murder." Wait, that doesn't make sense because preventing murder is a good thing. Unless B is suggesting that we should never stop a murder, which would be a negative stance. But that's opposite of what I think Nagel would say. Nagel is more likely to support the idea that we have a moral duty to prevent murder, not never do it.

Wait, the question is about what absolutism is. So, absolutism would say that we should always do something, without exceptions. So, if the view is that we should always prevent murder, that would be an absolutist position.

Looking at the options, the correct answer would be the one that says we should always prevent murder. Let's see which option that is.

Option B is "never prevent murder," which is the opposite. Wait, no, the question is about what absolutism is, so Nagel is clarifying that absolutism is the view that we should... So, the correct option would be that we should always prevent murder, but let's see the options again.

Wait, looking back, the options are about what we should do. So, if absolutism is the view that we should always prevent murder, then the correct option would be the one that says "always prevent murder." But looking at the options, I don't see an option that says that. Wait, let me check again.

Wait, the options are:

A: only sometimes prevent murder
B: never prevent murder
C: only sometimes avoid murder
D: always encourage murder
E: consider murder as a last resort
F: encourage murder under certain circumstances
G: only sometimes encourage murder
H: avoid murder except in self-defense situations
I: avoid murder at all costs

Hmm, none of the options directly say "always prevent murder." So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, the question is about Nagel's view of what absolutism is. So, Nagel is clarifying that absolutism is the view that we should... So, maybe he's saying that absolutism is the view that we should never prevent murder, which would be option B. Wait, that doesn't make sense because preventing murder is a moral duty.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing this with another philosopher. Let me think. Maybe Nagel is discussing whether certain actions, like lying, are permissible. Oh wait, I think Nagel's "Moral Luck" discusses this, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about whether we should always prevent murder, making that an absolute duty.

Wait, another approach: the term "absolutism" in ethics often refers to the idea that certain moral rules are absolutely binding, with no exceptions. So, for example, Kantian ethics is often seen as absolutist because it holds that certain actions are always wrong, regardless of the consequences.

So, if the question is about Nagel's clarification, perhaps he is saying that absolutism is the view that we should always prevent murder, making it an absolute duty. But looking at the options, none of them directly say "always prevent murder." Wait, option H says "avoid murder except in self-defense," which is similar but not the same as always preventing it.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B: never prevent murder. That would mean that according to absolutism, we should never stop a murder, which seems counterintuitive. But maybe Nagel is arguing against that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is misphrased.

Wait, maybe the question is about whether we should prevent murder, and the options are about when to prevent or encourage it. So, if absolutism is the view that we should always prevent murder, then the correct option would be something like "always prevent," but that's not present. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H: avoid murder except in self-defense. But that allows for an exception, which would make it not absolute.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The question is about what Nagel says absolutism is. So, if Nagel is clarifying that absolutism is the view that we should always prevent murder, then the correct option would be the one that says we should always do so. But looking at the options, option I says "avoid murder at all costs," which is similar to always preventing it. So, perhaps I is the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about whether we should always prevent murder, making that an absolute duty. So, the answer would be that we should always prevent it, which would correspond to option I: avoid murder at all costs.

Wait, but let me make sure. Nagel's view on this, from what I remember, is in his essay "The Problem of Abortion," where he discusses the duty to prevent harm. He argues that if a fetus has the right to life, then we have a duty to prevent its destruction, which would be an absolute duty. So, in that context, preventing murder (or abortion, in that case) is an absolute duty.

So, applying that to the question, Nagel would say that absolutism is the view that we should always prevent murder, i.e., avoid murder at all costs. So, the answer would be option I.

Wait, but option I says "avoid murder at all costs," which aligns with the idea that we must always prevent it, no exceptions. So, yes, I think that's the correct answer.
