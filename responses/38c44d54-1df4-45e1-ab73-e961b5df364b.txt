Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about energy loss rates of alpha particles in air. Hmm, I remember that alpha particles are helium nuclei, so they have a charge of +2e. The question says that the mean energy-loss rate for 3 MeV protons in air is 12.5 × 10^-2 MeV/cm. And I need to find the energy-loss rate for 3 MeV alpha particles in the same medium.

Wait, I think the energy loss depends on the charge of the particle because the stopping power is related to the charge squared. Oh right, the stopping power (or energy loss per unit distance) for a particle is proportional to the square of its charge. So protons have a charge of +e, and alpha particles have +2e. So the charge squared for the proton is e², and for the alpha it's (2e)² = 4e².

So if the proton's energy loss is given as 12.5 × 10^-2 MeV/cm, the alpha's should be four times that because (2)^2 is 4. Let me calculate that: 12.5e-2 * 4 = 0.125 * 4 = 0.5 MeV/cm. So that would be 5 × 10^-1 MeV/cm, which is 0.5 MeV/cm.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.5 MeV/cm, and option G is 15 × 10^-2 which is 0.15 MeV/cm. Wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check. The stopping power for an alpha is higher because it's more charged. So if the proton's loss is 0.125 MeV/cm, the alpha's should be 4 times that. 0.125 *4 is 0.5 MeV/cm, which is option C. So I think the answer is C.

The energy-loss rate for alpha particles is higher than that for protons because the stopping power is proportional to the square of the charge. Since alpha particles have a charge of +2e, their stopping power is four times that of protons (+e). Given the proton's energy-loss rate is 12.5 × 10^-2 MeV/cm, the alpha particle's rate is 4 × 0.125 = 0.5 MeV/cm.

Answer: C
