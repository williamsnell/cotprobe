Okay, so I have this question here about Walt Disney, Sony, and Time Warner. I need to figure out what they are examples of. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I'll try to recall what each of these companies does. Walt Disney is known for its theme parks, movies, and media. Sony is a big name in electronics, music, and entertainment. Time Warner, well, I think they own a lot of media properties, maybe like HBO or CNN. So all three are definitely large companies in the entertainment and media sector.

The question is asking what they are examples of. The options are from A to J. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: non-profit organizations. No, all three are for-profit companies. Non-profits don't aim to make profits, so this doesn't fit.

Option B: government-owned companies. Nope, these are all private companies. They're not owned by any government.

Option C: news broadcasting companies. Well, Time Warner does own CNN, which is a news network. Sony has channels too, but I'm not sure if they're primarily news. Disney has ABC News, so maybe. But I'm not sure if that's the best fit because all three are broader than just news.

Option D: international hotel chains. No, Disney has theme parks, but hotels are a smaller part. Sony and Time Warner don't primarily operate hotels.

Option E: online streaming platforms. Disney has Disney+, Sony has its own streaming service, and Time Warner has HBO. But they are more than just streaming; they're media conglomerates.

Option F: transnational corporations. Transnational means they operate across multiple countries. All three companies have global presence, so this could be a possibility.

Option G: technology companies. Sony is a tech company, but Disney and Time Warner are more about entertainment. So this might not cover all three.

Option H: multi-media empires. This seems to fit because they all own multiple media propertiesâ€”movies, TV, music, etc. So they are large, diverse media companies.

Option I: ownership concentrated within one medium. This might refer to media ownership being in one area, but these companies own across various media, so this doesn't seem right.

Option J: independent film studios. No, they are big studios, not independent.

So, considering all options, H: multi-media empires seems the best fit because all three companies own and control various media sectors, making them multi-media conglomerates. Transnational (F) is also a possibility because they operate globally, but the question is about what they are examples of, which is more about their nature as media companies rather than their operational scope.

The correct answer is H: multi-media empires. Walt Disney, Sony, and Time Warner are large, diversified media companies that own and control various forms of media, making them multi-media empires.

Answer: H
