Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is: What pressure must be exerted on 1 cm³ of water at 32°F and 15 psi to change the volume to 0.99 cm³? The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember something about bulk modulus and how pressure affects the volume of a fluid. Bulk modulus is the measure of the resistance of a fluid to compression. The formula I think is related to pressure, volume change, and the original volume.

The bulk modulus formula is: 
B = - P * (ΔV / V₀)
Where:
- B is the bulk modulus,
- P is the pressure applied,
- ΔV is the change in volume,
- V₀ is the original volume.

I need to rearrange this formula to solve for P. So, P = -B * (ΔV / V₀). But since pressure is a positive quantity in this context, I'll focus on the magnitude.

First, I need to find the bulk modulus for water at the given temperature. Wait, the temperature is 32°F. Let me convert that to Celsius because I think bulk modulus values are usually given in °C. 

32°F is equal to (32 - 32) * 5/9 = 0°C. Oh, right, that's the freezing point of water. So at 0°C, what's the bulk modulus of water? I recall that the bulk modulus of water is around 2.2 × 10^9 Pascals at 20°C, but I'm not sure about 0°C. Maybe it's slightly different. Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the value. Wait, but since I'm doing this mentally, maybe I can approximate. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes using a standard value, maybe 2.2e9 Pa as a rough estimate.

Wait, let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to use the given data and any standard bulk modulus value. Let's proceed with that.

So, B ≈ 2.2 × 10^9 Pa. But wait, let me check the units because the pressure given is in psi. I'll need to convert the bulk modulus into psi or convert the pressure into Pascals. Let me think: 1 Pascal is about 0.000145038 psi. So, 2.2e9 Pa * 0.000145038 ≈ 320,000 psi. Wait, that can't be right because that seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the conversion.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check: 1 psi is approximately 6894.76 Pascals. So, 1 Pa is 1/6894.76 psi ≈ 0.000145038 psi. So, 2.2e9 Pa * 0.000145038 psi/Pa ≈ 319,083.6 psi. So, B ≈ 319,084 psi.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct for water at 0°C. Let me see if I can find a more accurate value. From what I remember, the bulk modulus of water is about 2.19 × 10^9 Pa, which is approximately 317,000 psi. Hmm, okay, so around 317,000 psi.

So, B ≈ 317,000 psi.

Now, the original volume V₀ is 1 cm³, and the change in volume ΔV is 0.99 cm³ - 1 cm³ = -0.01 cm³. But since we're taking the absolute value for pressure, it'll be 0.01 cm³.

Wait, no, actually, the formula uses ΔV over V₀. So, ΔV is the change, which is final volume minus initial volume. So, 0.99 - 1 = -0.01 cm³. But since we're dealing with the magnitude, we can take the absolute value, but the formula includes the negative sign, so perhaps the pressure is positive because it's compressive. Anyway, let's proceed with the magnitude.

So, ΔV = -0.01 cm³, V₀ = 1 cm³.

So, ΔV/V₀ = -0.01 cm³ / 1 cm³ = -0.01.

Now, plugging into the formula: P = B * (ΔV / V₀), taking the magnitude.

So, P = 317,000 psi * (0.01) = 3,170 psi.

Wait, that's about 3,170 psi. Looking at the options, the closest one is option J: 3,200 psi. But wait, perhaps my bulk modulus value is a bit off.

Wait, let me check: I think the bulk modulus of water at 0°C is actually around 2.2 × 10^9 Pa, which is about 317,000 psi as I calculated. But maybe I should check the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using a different bulk modulus value.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, like assuming the coefficient of volume expansion and using the formula in a different way.

Wait, another thought: The problem says the initial pressure is 15 psi. So, do I need to consider that in the calculation? Because the bulk modulus relates to the pressure above atmospheric pressure. Or perhaps the initial pressure is included in the calculation.

Wait, the initial pressure is 15 psi, so the pressure exerted on top of that would be the additional pressure needed. So, perhaps the total pressure is 15 psi plus the pressure needed to cause the volume change. Or maybe the formula accounts for the pressure difference.

Wait, let me think again. The bulk modulus formula is B = P * (ΔV / V₀), where P is the pressure applied above the initial pressure. So, if the initial pressure is 15 psi, and the final pressure is P + 15 psi, then the pressure difference ΔP is P - 15 psi. But wait, no, the formula uses the absolute pressure, perhaps. Or maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the initial pressure is 15 psi, and we're looking for the total pressure needed, not the additional pressure. So, perhaps I should include that.

Wait, no, the formula B = P * (ΔV / V₀) uses the pressure that causes the volume change. So, if the initial pressure is 15 psi, and we're applying an additional pressure P to get to a total pressure of 15 psi + P, then the pressure in the formula would be the total pressure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the pressure relative to the initial pressure. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, let me clarify. The bulk modulus is defined as B = -V₀ (dP/dV) at constant temperature. So, the change in pressure dP is what's causing the change in volume dV. So, in this case, the change in pressure is the final pressure minus the initial pressure. So, ΔP = P_final - P_initial.

In the problem, P_initial is 15 psi. We're looking for P_final such that the volume changes from 1 cm³ to 0.99 cm³.

So, the formula should be: B = - (P_final - P_initial) * (ΔV / V₀).

But since we're dealing with magnitudes, we can write it as B = (P_final - P_initial) * (ΔV / V₀).

Wait, but in our case, ΔV is negative because the volume decreases, so ΔV = 0.99 - 1 = -0.01 cm³. So, (ΔV / V₀) is -0.01.

So, B = (P_final - P_initial) * (-0.01). But since B is positive, the pressure difference (P_final - P_initial) must be negative. That would imply that P_final is less than P_initial, which can't be right because applying pressure should increase the pressure, not decrease it. Wait, but in this case, the volume is decreasing, so pressure is increasing. Wait, no, let's think again.

Wait, when you apply pressure to water, it becomes slightly more compressed, so the pressure increases. Wait, but in the formula, B is positive, and ΔV is negative because the volume decreases. So, B = (P_final - P_initial) * (ΔV / V₀).

So, B = (P_f - P_i) * (-0.01).

But B is positive, so (P_f - P_i) must be negative, which would imply P_f < P_i, which can't be correct. Hmm, I must be making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the formula is B = - (P_f - P_i) * (ΔV / V₀). Because when pressure increases, volume decreases, so ΔV is negative, and the pressure difference is positive, making B positive. So, perhaps the correct formula is B = - (P_f - P_i) * (ΔV / V₀).

So, rearranging, (P_f - P_i) = - B * (ΔV / V₀).

But let me plug in the numbers.

ΔV = 0.99 - 1 = -0.01 cm³.

V₀ = 1 cm³.

So, (ΔV / V₀) = -0.01.

So, (P_f - P_i) = - B * (-0.01) = B * 0.01.

So, P_f = P_i + B * 0.01.

That makes sense because applying pressure increases the pressure.

So, P_f = 15 psi + (317,000 psi) * 0.01.

317,000 * 0.01 is 3,170 psi.

So, P_f = 15 + 3,170 = 3,185 psi.

Looking at the options, the closest one is J: 3,200 psi. But wait, let me check if my B value is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the bulk modulus value. Let me check again.

Wait, I think the bulk modulus of water is actually about 2.19 GPa (gigaPascals) at around 0°C, which is 2.19e9 Pa.

Converting that to psi: 2.19e9 Pa * (1 psi / 6894.76 Pa) ≈ 2.19e9 / 6894.76 ≈ 316,700 psi.

So, B ≈ 316,700 psi.

Then, P_f = 15 + 316700 * 0.01 = 15 + 3,167 = 3,182 psi.

Hmm, that's approximately 3,182 psi, which is close to option J: 3,200 psi, but not exact. However, perhaps I should double-check the bulk modulus value.

Wait, another source I recall says that the bulk modulus of water is about 2.2 × 10^9 Pa, which is 317,000 psi as I calculated earlier. So, 3,170 psi added to 15 psi gives 3,185 psi, which is about 3,185 psi. None of the options is exactly that, but option J is 3,200 psi, which is the closest.

But wait, looking back at the options, option D is 2,920 psi, which is lower. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the initial pressure is 15 psi, and the change in pressure is P - 15 psi, not P_f = 15 + (B * delta).

Wait, let me try another approach. Maybe the formula is expressed as:

ΔP = B * (ΔV / V₀)

So, ΔP = 316,700 psi * (0.01) = 3,167 psi.

So, the pressure to be exerted is the initial pressure plus this ΔP. So, 15 + 3,167 = 3,182 psi. But that's still around 3,180 psi, which is close to 3,200.

But looking at the options, J is 3,200, which is the closest. However, another thought: perhaps the problem is using a different bulk modulus value, maybe 2.15e9 Pa or something else, which would change the result.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me check the options again. The options are:

A: 2,750

B: 2,000

C: 1,950

D: 2,920

E: 3,000

F: 2,100

G: 3,450

H: 2,500

I: 1,500

J: 3,200

Wait, my calculation gives around 3,180 psi, which is closest to J: 3,200. But perhaps I made a mistake in the bulk modulus value.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the bulk modulus in GPa and I should use a different approach. Let me try to compute it again.

Bulk modulus B = 2.2 GPa = 2.2e9 Pa.

ΔV = -0.01 cm³.

V₀ = 1 cm³.

So, (ΔV / V₀) = -0.01.

So, using B = -ΔP * (ΔV / V₀), rearranged as ΔP = - B * (ΔV / V₀).

So, ΔP = -2.2e9 Pa * (-0.01) = 2.2e7 Pa.

Convert 2.2e7 Pa to psi: 2.2e7 / 6894.76 ≈ 3,193 psi.

So, ΔP ≈ 3,193 psi.

Now, the initial pressure is 15 psi, so the final pressure is 15 + 3,193 = 3,208 psi.

Which is very close to option J: 3,200 psi. So, that's the answer.

Wait, but perhaps the initial pressure is included in the calculation differently. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the change in pressure, not the total. Let me see.

Wait, the question says, "What pressure must be exerted..." So, perhaps it's the total pressure, not the additional pressure. But in that case, the calculation would be as above, giving around 3,200 psi, which is option J.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think differently.

Another approach: using the formula for compressibility, which is β = - (1/V₀) (dV/dP).

But β is 1/B, so B = 1/β.

But perhaps I can use the formula:

ΔV = - (V₀) * (ΔP) / B.

So, rearranged, ΔP = - (ΔV * B) / V₀.

Given that, ΔV is -0.01 cm³, V₀ is 1 cm³, B is 2.2e9 Pa.

So, ΔP = (- (-0.01) * 2.2e9) / 1 = 0.01 * 2.2e9 = 2.2e7 Pa.

Convert to psi: 2.2e7 Pa / 6894.76 ≈ 3,193 psi.

So, the change in pressure is 3,193 psi. Therefore, the total pressure is initial 15 psi plus this change, which is 3,208 psi, which is very close to 3,200 psi, so option J.

But wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the pressure is the additional pressure needed, not the total. Let me see the question again.

The question says, "What pressure must be exerted..." So, it's the total pressure. So, 3,208 psi is the total pressure. The options have J as 3,200 psi, which is very close.

So, I think the correct answer is J: 3,200 psi.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the pressure required to reduce the volume of water from 1 cm³ to 0.99 cm³ at 32°F (0°C) and an initial pressure of 15 psi. Using the bulk modulus of water, which is approximately 2.2 × 10⁹ Pa (or about 317,000 psi), the formula for pressure change is:

\[
\Delta P = B \cdot \frac{\Delta V}{V_0}
\]

Here, \( \Delta V = -0.01 \, \text{cm}^3 \) (volume change), \( V_0 = 1 \, \text{cm}^3 \), and \( B \approx 317,000 \, \text{psi} \). Plugging in the values:

\[
\Delta P = 317,000 \cdot (-0.01) = -3,170 \, \text{psi}
\]

The negative sign indicates a decrease in volume, so the magnitude of the pressure change is 3,170 psi. Adding this to the initial pressure of 15 psi gives the total pressure:

\[
P_{\text{total}} = 15 + 3,170 = 3,185 \, \text{psi}
\]

Among the options, the closest value is **3,200 psi**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**J: 3,200 psi**

The pressure required to achieve the volume change is approximately **3,200 psi**.
