Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a rotating coil in a magnetic field. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

First, the problem says there's a flat coil with 500 turns. Each turn has an area of 50 cm². It's rotating in a uniform magnetic field of 0.14 Wb/m². The rotation is about a diameter, and the axis is perpendicular to the field. The angular velocity is 150 rad/s. The coil has a resistance of 5 ohms, and the induced emf is connected via slip rings and brushes to an external resistance of 10 ohms. I need to find the peak current and the average power supplied to the 10-ohm resistor.

Hmm. I remember that when a coil rotates in a magnetic field, it induces an emf. The formula for the maximum induced emf (peak emf) is E_peak = N * B * A * ω, where N is the number of turns, B is the magnetic field strength, A is the area, and ω is the angular velocity. But wait, is that right? Or is it a different formula? Oh yeah, I think it's correct because the maximum emf occurs when the coil is rotating such that the magnetic flux is changing the fastest.

Wait, actually, the formula I recall is ε_peak = N * B * A * ω. So let me plug in the values.

N is 500 turns. B is 0.14 Wb/m². The area A is 50 cm², which I need to convert to m². Since 1 m² is 10,000 cm², 50 cm² is 50 / 10000 = 0.005 m². Oh wait, no. Wait, 1 m² = (100 cm)^2 = 10,000 cm². So 50 cm² is 50 / 10,000 = 0.005 m². Right.

Angular velocity ω is 150 rad/s.

So E_peak = 500 * 0.14 * 0.005 * 150.

Let me calculate that step by step.

First, 500 * 0.14 is 70. Then, 70 * 0.005 is 0.35. Then, 0.35 * 150 is 52.5 volts. So the peak emf is 52.5 V.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Because when a coil rotates, the emf is given by ε = N B A ω sin(ωt), so the peak is when sin(ωt) is 1, so E_peak is indeed N B A ω. So that part seems correct.

Now, the coil has a resistance of 5 ohms, and it's connected to an external 10-ohm resistor. So the total resistance in the circuit is the sum of the coil's resistance and the external resistor, right? Because they are in series. So total R_total = 5 + 10 = 15 ohms.

Wait, but wait a second. Is the coil's resistance part of the circuit when current flows? Because the emf is induced, and the current flows through both the coil's resistance and the external resistor. So yes, R_total is 15 ohms. So the peak current I_peak would be E_peak divided by R_total.

So I_peak = E_peak / R_total = 52.5 V / 15 ohms = 3.5 A. That's the peak current.

Now, the average power supplied to the 10-ohm resistor. Hmm. For average power in an AC circuit, especially for resistors, the average power is I² R, but since the current is sinusoidal, the average value of I squared is (I_peak² / 2). So the average power is (I_peak² / 2) * R_load, where R_load is 10 ohms.

Alternatively, since the power in an AC circuit is also given by P = (E_peak * I_peak) / 2 * R, but wait, I think I might be mixing things up.

Wait, another approach: The average power in a resistor is P_avg = (V_rms)^2 / R, where V_rms is the root mean square voltage across the resistor. But since the emf is the source, and the total voltage is across the entire circuit, the voltage across the external resistor would be a fraction of that, depending on the resistances.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to find the rms values. The peak current is 3.5 A, so the rms current is I_peak / sqrt(2) ≈ 3.5 / 1.414 ≈ 2.475 A. Then the average power is I_rms² * R. So (2.475)^2 * 10 ≈ 6.125 * 10 ≈ 61.25 W. Wait, but let me check if that's the correct approach.

Alternatively, since the current is sinusoidal, the average power is (V_peak * I_peak) / 2, but that's for the entire circuit. Wait, but the question asks for the average power supplied to the 10-ohm resistor. So perhaps I should find the voltage across the 10-ohm resistor and then compute the average power based on that.

The total emf is 52.5 V peak. The total resistance is 15 ohms. So the current is 3.5 A peak, as calculated. The voltage across the 10-ohm resistor would be I_peak * R_ext = 3.5 A * 10 ohms = 35 V peak. The rms voltage would be 35 / sqrt(2) ≈ 24.75 V.

Then the average power is (V_rms)^2 / R_ext = (24.75)^2 / 10 ≈ 612.56 / 10 ≈ 61.25 W.

Alternatively, using the average power formula for a resistor: P_avg = (I_peak^2 R_ext) / 2. So (3.5^2 * 10) / 2 = (12.25 *10)/2 = 122.5 / 2 = 61.25 W. Yep, that matches.

Wait, but let me double-check the initial calculation of E_peak. Let me recalculate it.

E_peak = N * B * A * ω.

N=500, B=0.14 Wb/m², A=0.005 m², ω=150 rad/s.

So 500 * 0.14 = 70.

70 *0.005=0.35.

0.35 *150=52.5 V. Correct.

So the peak current is 52.5 /15=3.5 A. That's the peak current. The average power to the 10-ohm resistor is (3.5)^2 * 10 / 2 = (12.25 *10)/2=122.5/2=61.25 W.

Looking at the options, option F says peak current is 3.5 A and average power is 61.25 W. So that should be the correct answer.

The problem involves calculating the peak current and average power supplied to a 10-Ω resistor in a rotating coil setup. 

1. **Peak EMF Calculation**:  
   The peak induced EMF is given by \( \varepsilon_{\text{peak}} = N \cdot B \cdot A \cdot \omega \), where:  
   - \( N = 500 \) turns,  
   - \( B = 0.14 \, \text{Wb/m}^2 \),  
   - \( A = 50 \, \text{cm}^2 = 0.005 \, \text{m}^2 \),  
   - \( \omega = 150 \, \text{rad/s} \).  

   Substituting:  
   \[
   \varepsilon_{\text{peak}} = 500 \cdot 0.14 \cdot 0.005 \cdot 150 = 52.5 \, \text{V}.
   \]

2. **Peak Current Calculation**:  
   The total resistance in the circuit is \( R_{\text{total}} = 5 \, \Omega + 10 \, \Omega = 15 \, \Omega \).  
   The peak current is:  
   \[
   I_{\text{peak}} = \frac{\varepsilon_{\text{peak}}}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{52.5}{15} = 3.5 \, \text{A}.
   \]

3. **Average Power Calculation**:  
   The average power supplied to the 10-Ω resistor is given by:  
   \[
   P_{\text{avg}} = \frac{I_{\text{peak}}^2 \cdot R_{\text{ext}}}{2}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( I_{\text{peak}} = 3.5 \, \text{A} \) and \( R_{\text{ext}} = 10 \, \Omega \):  
   \[
   P_{\text{avg}} = \frac{(3.5)^2 \cdot 10}{2} = \frac{12.25 \cdot 10}{2} = 61.25 \, \text{W}.
   \]

Thus, the peak current is **3.5 A**, and the average power supplied to the 10-Ω resistor is **61.25 W**.
