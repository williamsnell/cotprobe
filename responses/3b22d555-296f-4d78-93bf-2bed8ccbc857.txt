Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that A reacts with B in a one-step reaction to give C. The rate constant is given as 2.0 × 10^-3 M^-1 sec^-1. They've provided the moles of A and B and the volume of the container. I'm supposed to find the initial rate of the reaction.

Hmm, right. So, first, I remember that the rate law for a reaction depends on the order. Since it's a one-step reaction, I think the rate equation would be something like rate = k[A][B], assuming it's a second-order reaction, first order in each reactant. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Wait, the rate constant has units of M^-1 sec^-1. Let me recall: the units can help determine the order. For a reaction where the rate is k[A]^m [B]^n, the units of k are (M)^(1 - m -n) * sec^-1. 

So, if the rate is k [A][B], that would be second-order overall (m=1, n=1, so 1-1-1 = -1). So the units would be M^-1 sec^-1. Oh, right, that matches the given k. So the rate equation is rate = k [A][B].

Next, I need to calculate the concentrations of A and B. They've given the moles and the volume. 

Moles of A is 0.50 mol in 0.50 L. So concentration [A] = 0.50 mol / 0.50 L = 1.0 M.

Moles of B is 0.30 mol in 0.50 L. So [B] = 0.30 / 0.50 = 0.6 M.

Now, plug these into the rate equation. Rate = (2.0e-3 M^-1 sec^-1) * (1.0 M) * (0.6 M).

Let me calculate that. 2.0e-3 * 1 * 0.6 = 1.2e-3 M/sec.

Wait, but looking at the options, 1.20e-3 is option G. Hmm, but let me double-check. Did I do the concentrations right?

Yes, 0.5 mol in 0.5 L is 1 M. 0.3 mol in 0.5 L is 0.6 M. Multiply those and the rate constant: 2e-3 * 1 * 0.6 = 1.2e-3. So the initial rate should be 1.2 × 10^-3 M/sec. That's option G.

The reaction is second-order, with the rate law rate = k[A][B]. The given rate constant is 2.0 × 10^-3 M^-1 sec^-1. The concentrations of A and B are calculated as [A] = 1.0 M and [B] = 0.6 M. Substituting into the rate equation gives rate = (2.0 × 10^-3) × 1.0 × 0.6 = 1.2 × 10^-3 M/sec. 

Answer: G
