Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this DHT question. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step. 

The question is about a Chord-based distributed hash table with a 26 address space. There are 10 active peers with node IDs: N1, N11, N23, N31, N40, N45, N51, N60, and N63. I need to find all the target keys for node N1, in ascending order, ignoring its own ID.

First, I remember that in Chord, each node is responsible for a range of keys. The Chord protocol uses a consistent hashing mechanism where each node is assigned a key, and it's responsible for all keys in a certain interval. The keys are mapped using a modular arithmetic based on the number of bits in the address space.

Wait, the address space is 26, but that's a bit confusing because usually, DHTs use a power of two for the number of bits. Maybe 26 is the number of nodes, but perhaps it's more about the key space. Hmm, maybe the address space refers to the number of possible keys, which is 2^26, but perhaps in this problem, they're using a simplified model where the keys are from 1 to 26 or something like that. Alternatively, maybe the address space is 26 bits, but the exact size might not matter for this question.

Wait, the nodes' IDs are N1, N11, etc. So these are the node IDs, which are presumably in the range of 1 to (2^26 -1), but perhaps in this problem, the keys are just mapped modulo 26 or something else. Alternatively, maybe each key is assigned to a node based on the Chord protocol's way, using the successor function.

Wait, perhaps I should think about how Chord works. Each node stores a set of keys, and each key is mapped to a node using a hash function. The key is mapped to a node in the ring by taking the hash of the key, and then finding the successor of that key. But in this problem, perhaps each node is responsible for a specific range of keys, and the target keys for N1 are those that would be assigned to it based on their hash values.

Alternatively, maybe the target keys for a node are the ones that are assigned to it, which would be the keys where the hash(key) mod 26 is equal to the node's ID. Or perhaps it's the keys that are in the interval [node ID, successor(node ID)) mod 26.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. In Chord, each node is responsible for a range of keys from its own ID up to the next node's ID in the ring. So for node N1, the keys it's responsible for would be those where the hash(key) is between N1 and the next node in the ring.

So first, I need to order the nodes in the ring based on their IDs. The nodes are N1, N11, N23, N31, N40, N45, N51, N60, N63. Wait, that's 9 nodes, but the question says 10 active peers. Oh, I must have missed one. Let me count: N1, N11, N23, N31, N40, N45, N51, N60, N63— nine nodes. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check the question again. It says 10 active peers: N1, N11, N23, N31, N40, N45, N51, N60, and N63. Oh, that's nine. Hmm, maybe that's a typo, but perhaps I should proceed.

Wait, the address space is 26, so probably the keys are numbered from 1 to 26. Or perhaps the address space refers to a 26-bit space, but that's more complicated. Alternatively, maybe each key is a number from 1 to 26, and each node is assigned a subset of these keys.

Alternatively, perhaps the nodes' IDs are treated as keys in a way, and the DHT uses modular arithmetic to assign keys to nodes.

Wait, perhaps the target keys for a node are the keys that would be stored by that node. So for N1, the target keys would be the keys that hash to N1's ID. But in Chord, each node is responsible for a range of keys, so the target keys for N1 are those keys where the hash of the key falls into N1's interval.

Wait, perhaps the target keys for a node are the keys that it would store. So for node N1, which keys in the 26 address space would be assigned to it?

Wait, perhaps the way to approach this is to sort all the node IDs in a circular manner and determine the intervals each node is responsible for.

So, first, list all the node IDs and sort them. The nodes are: N1, N11, N23, N31, N40, N45, N51, N60, N63. Wait, that's nine nodes. Hmm, but the problem says 10 active peers. Oh, maybe I missed one. Let me check the question again: "peers in the network with node ID N1, N11, N15, N23, N31, N40, N45, N51, N60, and N63." Yes, that's 10 nodes. I must have misread earlier.

So the nodes are N1, N11, N15, N23, N31, N40, N45, N51, N60, N63. Now, I need to sort these in order.

Let's list them numerically:

N1 → 1

N11 →11

N15 →15

N23 →23

N31 →31

N40 →40

N45 →45

N51 →51

N60 →60

N63 →63

So the sorted list is: 1, 11, 15, 23, 31, 40, 45, 51, 60, 63.

Now, the address space is 26, but wait, the node IDs are up to 63, which is larger than 26. That's confusing. Maybe the address space refers to a different aspect, perhaps the key space is 26. Or perhaps the address space is 26 bits, so the maximum node ID is 2^26, but that's a large number. Alternatively, perhaps the address space is 26, meaning the keys are numbered from 0 to 25.

Wait, but the node IDs are N1, N11, etc., which are more than 26. Hmm, perhaps the address space refers to the number of possible keys, which is 26. So each key is a number from 0 to 25. But then, the node IDs are N1, which would be 1, N11 is 11, etc. So each node is responsible for a certain range of keys.

In Chord, each node is responsible for the keys in the interval [node ID, next node's ID), where the next node is the successor of the current node in the ring.

So, to find the target keys for N1, I need to find all the keys k where the hash(k) mod 26 is in the interval [1, next_node), where next_node is the smallest node ID greater than 1.

Wait, but if the keys are mod 26, then the next node after N1 would be the smallest node ID greater than 1. Looking at the sorted list, the next node after 1 is 11.

So N1 is responsible for keys from 1 to 11 (mod 26). So the keys would be 1,2,3,...,10,11.

Wait, but the problem says to ignore the node's ID itself. So for N1, we're looking for target keys (i.e., the keys that N1 is responsible for), excluding N1's own ID. So the target keys would be 2 to 11, but wait, the problem says to show all target keys in ascending order, ignoring the node's ID itself. So perhaps the keys are 2,3,4,...,11.

Wait, but the options don't have a list starting with 2. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: [11,15,23,31,40,45]

B: [1,11,15,23,31,40]

C: [12,24,36,48,60,63]

D: [3,5,7,9,11,13]

E: [2,3,5,9,17,33]

F: [7,14,28,56,63,70]

G: [4,8,16,32,48,64]

H: [13,26,39,52,65,78]

I: [2,4,6,8,10,12]

J: [5,10,20,30,40,50]

Hmm, none of these options start with 2 and go up to 11. So perhaps my initial approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the address space is 26, meaning the keys are from 0 to 25, and the node IDs are treated modulo 26. So node N1 is 1 mod 26, N11 is 11 mod 26, N15 is 15 mod 26, N23 is 23 mod 26, N31 is 5 (since 31-26=5), N40 is 14 (40-26=14), N45 is 19 (45-26=19), N51 is 25 (51-26=25), N60 is 8 (60-26*2=8), N63 is 11 (63-26*2=11, since 26*2=52, 63-52=11).

Wait, that's a possible approach. So the node IDs modulo 26 are:

N1 →1

N11→11

N15→15

N23→23

N31→5 (31-26=5)

N40→14 (40-26=14)

N45→19 (45-26=19)

N51→25 (51-26=25)

N60→8 (60-26*2=8)

N63→11 (63-26*2=11)

Wait, but N63 mod 26 is 11, which is the same as N11. That can't be right because each node should have a unique ID. So perhaps the node IDs are already within the 26 address space. Alternatively, perhaps the address space is 26, meaning each node ID is a number from 0 to 25. But the given node IDs are N1, N11, etc., which are more than 26. So perhaps the node IDs are modulo 26.

Wait, that would make N63 mod 26 equal to 11, which is the same as N11. That can't be correct because node IDs should be unique. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the address space.

Alternatively, perhaps the address space is 26, meaning that the keys are in the range 0-25, but the node IDs are outside that range and are mapped to the key space via some function.

Wait, perhaps the node IDs are mapped to the 26 address space by taking their last byte or something, but that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the node IDs are considered as their last digit, but that might not make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the address space being 26 refers to the number of bits, so 2^26 possible keys. But that's a huge number, and the node IDs are just a subset of those.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the address space is 26, so the keys are 26 in total, numbered 1 to 26, and the node IDs are mapped to these keys.

Wait, but the node IDs are N1, N11, etc., which are more than 26. So perhaps the node IDs are mapped modulo 26. So node N1 is 1, N11 is 11, N15 is 15, N23 is 23, N31 is 5 (31-26=5), N40 is 14 (40-26=14), N45 is 19 (45-26=19), N51 is 25 (51-26=25), N60 is 8 (60-26*2=8), and N63 is 11 (63-26*2=11). Wait, but N63 mod 26 is 11, which is the same as N11. That can't be because each node should have a unique ID. So perhaps this approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the address space refers to the number of nodes, which is 26, but the problem states there are 10 active peers, so that doesn't fit either.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think differently. In Chord, each node is responsible for a certain range of keys. The target keys for a node are the ones that would be stored by it. So for N1, the keys that fall into its interval would be the ones that, when hashed, fall between N1 and the next node in the ring.

So first, I need to arrange the nodes in the order of their IDs. The nodes are N1, N11, N15, N23, N31, N40, N45, N51, N60, N63. So sorted, they are: 1,11,15,23,31,40,45,51,60,63.

In a ring, after the highest node comes the lowest. So the order is 1,11,15,23,31,40,45,51,60,63, and then back to 1.

Each node is responsible for the interval from its ID up to the next node's ID. So N1 is responsible for keys from 1 up to 11 (since the next node is 11). So the keys that N1 would store are those where the hash(key) mod 26 is between 1 and 11, inclusive.

Wait, but the address space is 26, so perhaps the keys are 1 to 26. So N1 is responsible for keys 1-11. But the question says to ignore the node's ID itself, so the target keys would be 2-11.

But looking at the options, none of them have 2-11. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the address space.

Alternatively, perhaps the address space is 26, meaning the keys are 0-25. So N1 is 1, and the next node is 11. So N1 is responsible for keys 1-10 (since 11 is the next node). Wait, because the interval is [current, next), so 1 ≤ key <11.

So the keys would be 1,2,...,10. But the problem says to ignore the node's ID itself, so exclude 1. So the target keys are 2-10.

But again, the options don't have 2-10. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the target keys are not the keys in the key space but the node IDs that N1 is supposed to route to. Or perhaps the target keys are the keys that N1 is responsible for, which would be the keys that are assigned to it.

Wait, another approach: in Chord, each node stores a certain number of successor pointers. The number of keys each node stores depends on the number of bits in the hash function. For example, with a 160-bit hash, each node stores about 160 keys, but in this problem, perhaps each node is responsible for a range of keys based on their ID.

Alternatively, perhaps each node is responsible for a set of keys determined by the Chord protocol's finger tables. But that's more complex.

Wait, perhaps the target keys are the keys that are assigned to N1, which would be the keys where the hash(key) mod number_of_peers equals N1's ID. But that's for a simple modulo distribution, not Chord.

Alternatively, perhaps the target keys are the ones that are the successors of N1's ID. For example, the next node after N1 is N11, so the keys that are in [N1, N11) are assigned to N1. So the keys from 1 to 10 (since 11 is the next node) are assigned to N1. Ignoring N1's own ID, the target keys would be 2-10.

But again, the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the address space refers to the number of possible node IDs, which is 26, so each node ID is a number from 0 to 25. But in the problem, the node IDs are N1, N11, etc., which are more than 26. So perhaps the node IDs are modulo 26.

So N1 is 1, N11 is 11, N15 is 15, N23 is 23, N31 is 5 (31 mod 26=5), N40 is 14 (40 mod 26=14), N45 is 19 (45-26=19), N51 is 25 (51-26=25), N60 is 8 (60-26*2=8), N63 is 11 (63 mod 26=11, since 26*2=52, 63-52=11).

Wait, but N63 mod 26 is 11, which is the same as N11. That can't be right because each node should have a unique ID. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the address space is 26, meaning the keys are 1 to 26, and the node IDs are as given. So the nodes are N1 (1), N11 (11), N15 (15), N23 (23), N31 (31), N40 (40), N45 (45), N51 (51), N60 (60), N63 (63). But these are all beyond 26, so perhaps the keys are mapped to node IDs modulo 26.

So for key 1: hash(1) mod 26 =1 → N1.

Key 2: 2 mod26=2 → but there's no node with ID 2, so perhaps the next node after 1 is 11, so key 2 would be assigned to N11.

Wait, no, in Chord, each key is assigned to the node that is the successor of the key's hash value. So for key k, compute hash(k), find the successor of hash(k), and assign it to that node.

But in this problem, perhaps the keys are the node IDs themselves. Or perhaps the keys are the same as the node IDs.

Wait, perhaps the target keys for N1 are the keys that are in the range [N1, next_node), where next_node is the successor of N1. So the keys would be from 1 to 11 (since next node is 11), but excluding 1.

So the target keys would be 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11.

But the options don't have this. The closest is option I: [2,4,6,8,10,12], but that's only even numbers up to 12. Wait, but the target keys should be all numbers from 2 to 10, not just even ones.

Alternatively, perhaps the target keys are those that are the successors of N1's ID. For example, the next node after N1 is N11, so the keys that would point to N1 are those where the hash(key) mod 26 is between N1 and N11, which is 1 < hash(key) <11.

But again, the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the address space is 26, so the keys are 0-25, and the node IDs are mapped modulo 26. So N1 is 1, N11 is 11, N15 is 15, N23 is 23, N31 is 5, N40 is 14, N45 is 19, N51 is 25, N60 is 8, N63 is 11.

Wait, but N63 mod26 is 11, same as N11. That's a problem because node IDs should be unique. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the address space refers to the number of bits, so 26 bits. But that's a very large number, and the node IDs are small in comparison.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach. Maybe the target keys for N1 are the keys that are the immediate successors of N1's ID. So for each key, the target is the successor node. So for N1, the target keys are the keys that would be routed to N1's successor, which is N11.

Wait, but the question is about the target keys for N1, not for the keys that point to N1.

Alternatively, perhaps the target keys are the keys that N1 is responsible for, which would be the keys in the interval [N1, next_node). So for N1, next_node is N11 (11). So N1 is responsible for keys from 1 to 10 (since 11 is the next node). Ignoring N1's own ID, the target keys would be 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.

But again, none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps the target keys are those that are the successors of N1's ID. So the target is N11, and the keys that point to N11 would be those in [N11, next_node after N11). So perhaps the target keys for N1 are the ones that point to N11, which would be keys from 11 to 15 (since the next node after 11 is 15). So the target keys would be 11,12,13,14.

But that's not matching any options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the target keys are the ones that are assigned to N1, which would be the keys that are in the interval [N1, next_node). So N1 is responsible for keys 1-10. So the target keys are 1,2,...,10. Ignoring N1's ID, it's 2-10.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the target keys are those that are the immediate next nodes. For example, N1's target is N11, N11's target is N15, etc. So for N1, the target key would be the key that points to N11, which is the key where hash(key) mod something equals 11. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the target keys are the ones that are the start of each node's interval. So for N1, the target key is 1, but we have to ignore it, so perhaps the next key is 11, which is the start of N11's interval. So the target keys for N1 would be 11,15,23,31,40,45,51,60,63.

But that's option A: [11,15,23,31,40,45], but that's only six elements, and the correct count should be more.

Wait, but the problem says to show all target keys in ascending order, ignoring the node's ID itself. So perhaps the target keys are the keys that are the start of each node's interval, excluding N1's own ID.

So the nodes are in order:1,11,15,23,31,40,45,51,60,63.

So the start of each interval is 1,11,15,23,31,40,45,51,60,63.

Ignoring N1's ID (1), the target keys would be 11,15,23,31,40,45,51,60,63.

But the options don't have this. Option A is [11,15,23,31,40,45], which is missing 51,60,63.

Hmm, perhaps the target keys are only the immediate next nodes. So for N1, the target key is the key that points to the next node, which is N11. So the key would be 11. But the options don't have that either.

Alternatively, perhaps the target keys are those that are the successors of N1's ID. So the target is N11, and the key that points to N11 is the key where hash(key) mod something equals N11's ID. But perhaps the target key is the key that is the immediate next after N1's ID, which is 11.

Wait, perhaps the target keys are the keys that are the start of other nodes' intervals. So for N1, the target keys are the IDs of the other nodes, which are 11,15,23,31,40,45,51,60,63.

But the options don't have all of these. Option A has six of them: [11,15,23,31,40,45].

But why would the target keys only include these and not the others? Maybe because each node is only responsible for a certain range, and the target keys are the ones that are the start of the next node's interval.

Alternatively, perhaps the target keys are the ones that are the immediate next node's ID. So for N1, the target key is 11, which is the next node. But the options don't have a single key.

Wait, perhaps the target keys are the keys that N1 is responsible for, which are the keys in the interval [1,11), so 1-10. Ignoring N1's own ID, the target keys are 2-10. But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the target keys are the ones that are the successor of N1's ID. So the successor of 1 is 11, so the target key is 11. But the options don't have a single key.

Alternatively, perhaps the target keys are the ones that are the start of each node's interval, but only up to a certain point. For example, the first few successors.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think about the Chord protocol's way of assigning keys. Each node is responsible for a range of keys, and the target keys for a node are the keys that fall into that range.

So for N1, the range is from N1 to the next node, which is N11. So the keys in [1,11) are assigned to N1. Excluding N1 itself, the target keys are 2-10.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the address space is 26, and the keys are 0-25, and the node IDs are mapped modulo 26. So N1 is 1, N11 is 11, N15 is 15, N23 is 23, N31 is 5, N40 is 14, N45 is 19, N51 is 25, N60 is 8, N63 is 11.

Wait, but N63 mod26 is 11, which is same as N11. So perhaps the node IDs are unique, so perhaps the address space is larger than 26, and the node IDs are as given.

Wait, perhaps the address space is 26, meaning that the keys are 0-25, and the node IDs are mapped to these keys via some function. For example, each node ID is the last two digits, so N1 is 1, N11 is 11, N15 is 15, N23 is 23, N31 is 1 (31 mod 26=5?), wait no, 31-26=5. So N31 would be 5.

Wait, perhaps the node IDs are assigned as follows:

N1 →1

N11→11

N15→15

N23→23

N31→5 (31-26=5)

N40→14 (40-26=14)

N45→19 (45-26=19)

N51→25 (51-26=25)

N60→8 (60-26*2=8)

N63→11 (63-26*2=11)

Wait, but N63 mod26 is 11, same as N11. That can't be right. So perhaps the node IDs are unique, and the address space is larger than 26.

Alternatively, perhaps the address space is 26, and the keys are 0-25, and the node IDs are mapped to these keys. So N1 is 1, N11 is 11, N15 is 15, N23 is 23, N31 is 5, N40 is 14, N45 is 19, N51 is 25, N60 is 8, N63 is 11.

But again, N63 would be 11, same as N11. This is conflicting.

Perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the node IDs are as given, and the address space is 26, meaning the keys are 0-25. So each key is assigned to a node based on the Chord protocol.

In Chord, each key k is assigned to the node which is the successor of hash(k). The successor function finds the smallest node ID greater than hash(k).

So for each key k in 0-25, compute hash(k) = k (assuming the hash is identity), then find the successor node, which is the smallest node ID greater than k.

So for key 0: successor is 1 → assigned to N1.

Key 1: successor is 11 → assigned to N11.

Key 2: successor is 11 → N11.

Key 3: same, N11.

...

Key 10: successor is 11 → N11.

Key 11: successor is 15 → N15.

Key 12: successor is 15 → N15.

...

Key 14: successor is 15 → N15.

Key15: successor is23 → N23.

Key16: successor is23 → N23.

...

Key22: successor is23 → N23.

Key23: successor is31 → N31.

Key24: successor is31 → N31.

Key25: successor is31 → N31.

Wait, but the node IDs after 23 are 31, which is higher than 23, so for keys 23,24,25, the successor is 31.

So for N1, the target keys are the keys where the successor is N1. Looking at the above, only key 0 has successor 1 (N1). So the target key for N1 is 0.

But the problem says to ignore the node's ID itself, so perhaps 0 is the only target key. But the options don't have 0.

Alternatively, perhaps the keys are 1-26, and the same logic applies. So key 1's successor is 11 → N11.

Key 2's successor is11 → N11.

...

Key10: successor 11 → N11.

Key11: successor15 → N15.

Key12: successor15 → N15.

...

Key14: successor15 → N15.

Key15: successor23 → N23.

Key16: successor23 → N23.

...

Key22: successor23 → N23.

Key23: successor31 → N31.

Key24: successor31 → N31.

Key25: successor31 → N31.

Key26: successor31 → N31.

So for N1, the only key that points to it is key 1, but the problem says to ignore the node's ID itself. So N1 has no target keys, which can't be right.

This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the target keys are those that N1 is responsible for, which are the keys in the interval [N1, next_node). So N1 is responsible for keys from 1 to 10 (since next node is 11). So the target keys are 1,2,...,10. Ignoring N1's own ID, it's 2-10.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the target keys are the ones that are the immediate next nodes. So for N1, the target key is 11, which is the next node. So the target key is 11. But the options don't have a single key.

Wait, perhaps the target keys are the ones that are the start of each node's interval, excluding N1's own ID. So the target keys would be 11,15,23,31,40,45,51,60,63. But the options don't have all of these.

Option A is [11,15,23,31,40,45], which includes six of them. So perhaps the answer is A.

But why would the target keys be only these? Maybe because each node is responsible for a range up to the next node, and the target keys are the start of each node's interval.

So for N1, the target keys would be the next nodes' IDs: 11,15,23,31,40,45,51,60,63.

But the options only have up to 45 in option A. So perhaps the answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps the target keys are the ones that are the immediate next node's ID, which is 11. So the target key is 11, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the target keys are the ones that are the immediate next node's ID and the ones after that, up to a certain point. But I'm not sure.

Given the confusion, perhaps the correct answer is option A: [11,15,23,31,40,45].

To determine the target keys for node N1 in a Chord-based distributed hash table (DHT) with a 26 address space, we first need to understand how Chord assigns keys to nodes. In Chord, each node is responsible for a range of keys from its own ID up to the next node's ID in the ring. The keys are assigned based on their hash values, and the target keys for a node are those that fall within its interval.

The nodes are given as N1, N11, N15, N23, N31, N40, N45, N51, N60, and N63. These node IDs are treated as numerical values, and the nodes are arranged in ascending order: **1, 11, 15, 23, 31, 40, 45, 51, 60, 63**. In a circular arrangement, the next node after N63 (63) is N1 (1).

Node N1 is responsible for the interval of keys from its ID (1) up to the next node's ID (11). Therefore, the keys in the range **[1, 11)** are assigned to N1. Ignoring N1's own ID (1), the target keys for N1 are **2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11**.

However, the question asks for the target keys in ascending order, and the options provided do not include the full range of keys from 2 to 11. Instead, the options suggest that the target keys are the IDs of the next nodes in the ring. For N1, the next node is N11 (11), and the subsequent nodes are N15 (15), N23 (23), N31 (31), N40 (40), N45 (45), N51 (51), N60 (60), and N63 (63). These IDs represent the boundaries of the intervals that N1 would route to.

Among the options, **Option A** lists the IDs of the next six nodes in the ring: **[11, 15, 23, 31, 40, 45]**. While the full list of target keys would include all subsequent node IDs up to N63, the provided options do not include the complete set. Therefore, the most reasonable answer based on the given options is **Option A**.
