Okay, I'm trying to figure out which proposition a critical legal theorist would reject. Let me start by recalling what I know about critical legal theory. From what I remember, critical legal theorists often critique traditional views of law. They don't see law as neutral or above society; instead, they argue that law is influenced by social, political, and economic factors.

So the question is asking which proposition would be rejected by them. Let's look at each option:

Option A: Law is unstable. Critical legal theorists might say that law isn't always clear or fixed. They might argue that it's influenced by power dynamics, so maybe law being unstable isn't something they'd reject. In fact, they might agree that law can change based on who's in power or other factors.

Option B: Law is determinate. Determinate means that law is clear, definite, and can be applied without much interpretation. Critical theorists likely reject this because they believe law is shaped by those in power and isn't just a set of fixed rules. So they might say law isn't determinate.

Option C: Law reflects economic power. This sounds like something critical theorists would support. They often talk about how law serves the interests of those in power, including economic elites. So they wouldn't reject this.

Option D: Law is politics. Critical legal theorists definitely argue that law is political. They don't see it as separate from politics but rather as intertwined. So they wouldn't reject this idea.

Option E: Law is a social construct. This aligns with their view that law isn't fixed or natural but created by society and subject to change. They wouldn't reject this.

So putting it together, the proposition that critical legal theorists would reject is B: Law is determinate. They don't think law is clear and fixed; they see it as shaped by power and politics.

The proposition that would be rejected by critical legal theorists is B: Law is determinate. Critical legal theorists argue that law is not fixed or neutral but is shaped by social, political, and economic factors.
