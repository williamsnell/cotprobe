The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
I walk alongside the column, ask what's going on.
A soldier says simply: "They call up more every day.
"Some of us were sent north to the Yellow River at age fifteen,
And now at forty we're heading off to the garrisons in the west.
On our first tour, the village headman had to tie our bandannas for us.
When we came back, our hair was white, but still there's more unrest.
The frontier garrisons run with blood, enough to fill an ocean,
But the Martial Emperor's territorial ambitions have yet to crest.
In the hundred districts east of the mountains, throughout the land of Han,
There must be ten thousand villages that brambles now infest.
Even if wives are strong enough to handle a hoe and plow,
The crops grow every which way, the fields are all a mess.
It's hardest for the Shanxi men, with their reputations as fighters:
They're rounded up like dogs or chickens, every male impressed.
"But sir, though it's good of you to ask,
Complaining isn't part of the soldier's task.
We can only shake our heads. Take this winter:
The Shanxi troops were never sent home.
The District Officers are demanding the land tax,
But where will it come from? You can't get blood from a stone!
I honestly think it's bad luck to bear a son now,
It's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry
And live with the neighbors next door.
But a son will end up lying on some distant prairie."
Du Fu, "Ballad of the Army Carts," ca. 750 C.E.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the poem by Du Fu called "Ballad of the Army Carts." The question is about what the poem reveals regarding gender relations in Tang society. The options are A through H, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I'll read the poem again to get a clear understanding. The poem describes soldiers talking about their experiences, the conscription system, and the impact on their families and society. They mention being sent off to war starting at a young age, and when they return, their hair is white, but there's still unrest. There's a lot of mention about the state of the frontier garrisons and the emperor's ambitions.

One part that stands out is when the speaker says, "It's hardest for the Shanxi men, with their reputations as fighters: They're rounded up like dogs or chickens, every male impressed." This indicates that men are being conscripted into the military, which suggests that men are expected to handle the responsibilities outside the home, like military service, while women might be left behind.

Then, later in the poem, the speaker says, "I honestly think it's bad luck to bear a son now, It's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry And live with the neighbors next door. But a son will end up lying on some distant prairie." This part is key. The speaker is expressing that having a son is a bad thing because sons are being taken away for military service, leaving the family without support. In contrast, a daughter can marry and stay nearby, which is seen as a better outcome.

Looking at the options:

A: Women had limited roles outside the home. Well, the poem doesn't directly talk about women's roles outside the home but focuses more on the consequences of having sons versus daughters. So A might be part of the picture, but not directly what's highlighted here.

B: Imperial rescripts emphasized the birth of sons over daughters for conscription. The poem mentions sons being taken for military service, but it's not clear if the rescripts themselves emphasized sons. It might be more about the societal view rather than imperial policy, so B could be a contender but not certain.

C: Agricultural work could be shared by both genders. The poem talks about wives using hoes and plows, implying that women are helping with farming. This suggests that women did participate in agricultural work, which would indicate shared responsibilities. So C is a possible answer.

D: Women were encouraged to become soldiers. The poem doesn't mention women joining the military; instead, it's the men who are being conscripted. So D seems unlikely.

E: Gender relations were reversed during Empress Wu Zetian's reign. The poem is from around 750 C.E., and Empress Wu Zetian's reign was earlier, so it's probably not about her. Plus, the poem doesn't talk about empresses or gender reversal. So E is probably not the answer.

F: The birth of a daughter was seen as a misfortune. Wait, the poem says it's better to have a daughter because sons end up in distant places. So having a daughter is seen as more fortunate, which is the opposite of F. Therefore, F is incorrect because the poem suggests daughters are preferred.

G: Men were responsible for the household, women for fields. The poem says women are working the fields, but it doesn't specify if men were handling the household. It might be more that both are working in the fields, given the line about wives using hoes and plows. So G might not be accurate.

H: Confucian relationships were strong. The poem doesn't directly address Confucian relationships between husbands and wives, so H is probably not the focus.

Now, focusing on the options again. The part about daughters being preferable suggests that having sons is problematic because they're taken away for the military. This implies that the societal view was that it's better to have daughters, who can contribute differently and stay with the family. This relates to the division of labor and societal expectations based on gender.

Option C says that agricultural work could be shared by women and men. The poem mentions wives handling the hoe and plow, so they are involved in farming. This indicates that both genders contributed to agricultural work, which supports option C.

Option A talks about women's limited roles outside the home. While the poem shows women working in the fields, it doesn't necessarily limit their roles outside the home, as they are contributing to the family's livelihood through work. So A might not be the best choice.

Option F is incorrect because the poem actually prefers daughters as they can stay and help, whereas sons are taken away. So F is the opposite.

Therefore, the poem provides evidence that agricultural work was shared, which aligns with option C.

The poem highlights the societal view that having a daughter is preferable to having a son, as sons are conscripted into the military, leaving the family without support. This implies that agricultural work was shared between genders, with women contributing through farming. 

Answer: C
