Options:

A: The auditor may have selected the wrong accounts to send the blank form to.
B: The blank form might be too complicated for the recipient to understand.

E: The blank form might be lost in the mail, resulting in no response.
F: All accounts do not have an equal opportunity to be selected for confirmation.
G: The recipient may not have the necessary information to fill the blank form.

I: The blank form may be mistaken for junk mail and discarded.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about auditing. The question is about the effectiveness of using a blank form for positive accounts receivable confirmation. I need to figure out why the blank form might be ineffective.

First, let me recall what I know about accounts receivable confirmation. Auditors send confirmations to customers to verify the existence and accuracy of accounts receivable balances. There are two types: blank and pre-filled forms.

A blank form typically just asks the recipient to confirm the balance. But I've heard that this method can be less effective because it relies on the recipient to remember or have the information handy. If they don't, they might not respond or might make mistakes.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The auditor may have selected the wrong accounts. That's more about selection criteria rather than the form itself being ineffective. So probably not the right answer.

Option B: The blank form is too complicated. I don't think that's the main issue because the blank form is usually simple. It's just asking for a balance, so complexity isn't the main problem here.

Option C: Accounts confirmed aren't representative. That's about sampling, not the form. If the auditor selects the right sample, the form type shouldn't affect representativeness. So maybe not C.

Option D: Unconfirmed accounts might be written off. Wait, if accounts are uncollectible, they might not respond. But is that a problem with the blank form itself? Maybe, but I'm not sure yet.

Option E: The form might be lost. That's a possibility, but it's about mail issues, not the form's design. I'm not sure if that's the main reason it's ineffective.

Option F: Not all accounts have equal chance to be selected. That's a sampling issue, like stratified sampling, not directly related to the form's effectiveness.

Option G: Recipient lacks info to fill the form. That makes sense. If the recipient doesn't have the current balance information, they can't fill it out, so the confirmation might be ineffective. So G seems plausible.

Option H: Few responses because more effort is needed. Wait, with a blank form, the recipient just needs to write the balance, which is less effort than filling out a pre-filled form where they might have to check each line. So actually, blank forms might get more responses. So H might not be correct.

Option I: Mistaken for junk mail. That's possible, but again, it's more about the mailing process rather than the form's effectiveness.

So the key issue with a blank form is that the recipient might not have the information to fill it out. That would make the confirmation ineffective because they can't provide the correct balance. So the answer should be G.

The blank form of positive accounts receivable confirmation may be ineffective because the recipient may not have the necessary information to fill out the form accurately. This can lead to incomplete or incorrect responses, undermining the effectiveness of the audit procedure.

Answer: G
