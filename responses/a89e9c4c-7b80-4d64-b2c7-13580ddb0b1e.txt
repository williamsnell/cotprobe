Question:

Why do economists stress the cross-elasticitiesbetween different factors of production?

Options:

A: Cross-elasticity is used to calculate the gross domestic product (GDP)
B: Cross-elasticity is essential for setting the price of luxury goods
C: Cross-elasticity is a measure of consumer preference stability over time
D: Cross-elasticity is important to maintain economic balance
E: Cross-elasticity influences the interest rates set by central banks
F: Cross-elasticity determines the fixed costs of production
G: Cross-elasticity is crucial for international trade
H: Cross-elasticity helps in predicting the weather impact on crop production
I: Cross-elasticity between the factors of production is important because factors of production often interact, at times by complementing each other's functions, at times serving as each other's substitute.
J: Cross-elasticity is important due to government regulations

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why economists stress the cross-elasticities between different factors of production. Hmm, cross-elasticity... I remember that elasticity in economics usually refers to how responsive one variable is to a change in another. So cross-elasticity would be the responsiveness of one factor of production to changes in another factor's price or availability.

Wait, factors of production are things like labor, capital, land, and entrepreneurship. So cross-elasticity between them would mean how, say, the demand for labor changes when the price of capital changes. Or how land use might shift based on changes in labor costs.

Economists probably study this because factors of production often aren't used in isolation. Sometimes they complement each other, like how more machinery (capital) can make workers (labor) more productive. Other times, they might substitute for each other. For example, if the cost of labor goes up, businesses might invest more in automation (capital) as a substitute.

So why is this important? Well, understanding cross-elasticities helps in analyzing how changes in one factor affect others. This is crucial for things like production decisions, cost estimation, and overall economic planning. If one factor's price increases, knowing how other factors will be affected can help firms adjust their strategies.

Looking at the options:

Option I says that cross-elasticity is important because factors often interact, sometimes complementing, sometimes substituting. That makes sense because it directly relates to why economists would study how changes in one affect the others.

Other options: 
A: GDP calculation? I don't think cross-elasticity is directly used for GDP. GDP is more about output and income.
B: Luxury goods pricing? Maybe, but cross-elasticity is broader than that.
C: Consumer preference stability? That seems more related to price elasticity of demand, not factors of production.
D: Economic balance? Maybe, but I'm not sure how directly cross-elasticity ties to maintaining balance.
E: Interest rates? Possibly through investment decisions, but seems indirect.
F: Fixed costs? Cross-elasticity is about variable responsiveness, not fixed costs.
G: International trade? Perhaps, but not directly clear.
H: Weather impact on crops? That's more about supply shocks in agriculture.
J: Government regulations? Not directly related unless regulations affect factor prices.

So I think the best fit is option I.

The correct answer is I: Cross-elasticity between the factors of production is important because factors of production often interact, at times by complementing each other's functions, at times serving as each other's substitute.

The answer is I.
