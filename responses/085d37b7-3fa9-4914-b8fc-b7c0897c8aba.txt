Question:

Two brothers who were in need of money approached their wealthy uncle's housekeeper and asked her to poison him. The brothers would inherit the uncle's estate when he died. The housekeeper agreed, but on the condition that they would pay her $10,000 from their inheritance. After the brothers agreed to her demand, the housekeeper decided to place some cyanide in the uncle's tea one morning. As the housekeeper was preparing the tea, the uncle was visited by his personal physician. When the housekeeper was ready to serve the tea, the uncle asked her to fix some tea for his physician also. The housekeeper did so and then carefully set the tea on the table so that the uncle's cup was facing him. However, when the physician reached over to get some sugar, he inadvertently took the uncle's cup with the cyanide and drank it. Seconds later, the physician died from the poison. Which of the following crimes are the brothers guilty of?

Options:

A: Solicitation, conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and attempted murder of the physician.
B: Murder of both their uncle and the physician.
C: Conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and murder of the physician.
D: Solicitation, conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and involuntary manslaughter of the physician.
E: Conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle and the physician.
F: Conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and murder of the housekeeper.
G: Conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and attempted murder of the physician.
H: Solicitation, conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and murder of the physician.
I: Conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle only.
J: Conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and involuntary manslaughter of the physician.

Alright, let's try to figure out this legal problem. So, we've got two brothers who are in need of money. They approach their uncle's housekeeper and ask her to poison him. The uncle is wealthy, and when he dies, the brothers will inherit his estate. The housekeeper agrees but wants $10,000 from their inheritance. They agree, and then the housekeeper decides to put cyanide in the uncle's tea.

Now, here's where things get a bit tricky. As she's preparing the tea, the uncle's personal physician comes to visit. The housekeeper gets the tea ready, sets it on the table, making sure the uncle's cup is facing him. But when the physician reaches for sugar, he accidentally takes the uncle's cup with the cyanide and drinks it. He dies immediately.

Okay, so the question is about what crimes the brothers are guilty of. The options range from murder, conspiracy, solicitation, attempted murder, and involuntary manslaughter. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the brothers approached the housekeeper to poison their uncle. That's clearly an attempt to commit murder. In legal terms, solicitation is when someone asks another to commit a crime. So the brothers are guilty of solicitation of murder regarding their uncle.

Next, conspiracy. Conspiracy requires an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime, plus at least one overt act towards the commission of that crime. Here, the brothers and the housekeeper agreed, and the housekeeper actually put the cyanide in the tea. So they conspired to murder the uncle.

Now, what about the physician? The physician died because he accidentally took the uncle's cup. The brothers didn't intend for the physician to die. The poison was meant for the uncle, but the physician's death was an unintended consequence.

In criminal law, there's the concept of transferred intent. Normally, if someone intends to kill A but kills B, the intent transfers, and they can be charged with murder for B's death. But here, the brothers didn't intend to kill the physician; the poison was meant for the uncle. However, the brothers might be liable for the physician's death under the doctrine of "depraved heart" murder or perhaps felony murder.

Wait, felony murder applies when a death occurs during the commission of a felony. The brothers were involved in a conspiracy to commit murder (the felony), and during that felony, the physician was killed. So under felony murder rules, the brothers could be charged with the physician's murder.

Alternatively, if the death wasn't a direct result of the felony but was foreseeable, they might be guilty of manslaughter. But since the death was a direct result of their actions (the poison was their plan, and it led to the physician's death), it's more likely murder.

Looking at the options, H says they're guilty of solicitation, conspiracy to murder their uncle, and murder of the physician. That seems to fit because they solicited and conspired for the uncle's murder and, through the felony, are responsible for the physician's death as murder.

Wait, but another angle: the brothers didn't directly cause the physician's death. The housekeeper did. So maybe the brothers are only liable for the uncle's death. But the housekeeper was acting at their behest, so perhaps the brothers are vicariously liable for her actions.

Alternatively, the brothers' conspiracy included the act of poisoning, which led to both deaths. So they could be charged with the deaths of both, but the options don't all include that.

Option B says murder of both uncle and physician. But the brothers didn't directly kill the physician. They only conspired to kill the uncle. The physician's death was an accidental result.

So, under felony murder, they could be guilty of the uncle's murder (as they conspired and solicited it) and the physician's death as a felony murder. Alternatively, if the physician's death wasn't foreseeable, maybe it's just an unintended killing, leading to manslaughter.

Wait, but felony murder typically applies even if the death wasn't intended. So if the brothers were committing a felony (conspiracy to murder), and during that, someone dies (the physician), they could be charged with felony murder for the physician's death.

So the brothers are guilty of solicitation and conspiracy for the uncle's murder, and felony murder for the physician's death. So looking at the options:

Option H: Solicitation, conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and murder of the physician.

Yes, that seems right. So the answer would be H.

The brothers are guilty of solicitation and conspiracy to murder their uncle, as they directly solicited and conspired with the housekeeper to kill him. Additionally, under the felony murder rule, since the physician's death occurred during the commission of the felony (conspiracy to commit murder), the brothers are also guilty of the physician's murder. 

Answer: H
