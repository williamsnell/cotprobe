Okay, so I've got this question about marginal costs, and I'm trying to figure out what it means. I'm a bit rusty on my economics terms, but let me think through this.

First, the question is asking for the definition of marginal costs. I remember that marginal cost is related to the cost of producing an additional unit. But wait, is it the cost of producing just one more unit, or something else?

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. Option A says the cost of all produced units. That sounds more like total cost, not marginal. So A is probably not the right answer.

Option B is the fixed cost associated with the production facility. Fixed costs are costs that don't change with production levels, like rent or salaries. Marginal cost isn't about fixed costs, so B is out.

Option C is the cost of total production. Again, that's total cost, which is different from marginal. So C is not it either.

Option D is the cost of the initial unit of production. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Marginal cost is about adding one more unit, not the first one.

Option E says the additional cost of one more unit of production. This seems familiar. I think marginal cost is exactly that—the extra cost you incur by producing one more unit. So E might be the correct answer.

Option F refers to total revenue from selling one additional unit. Wait, no, that's revenue, not cost. So F is about revenue, not cost, so it's not the answer.

Option G is the average cost of all units produced. Average cost would be total cost divided by the number of units, which is different from marginal cost. So G is not it.

Option H mentions cost savings from producing an extra unit. That sounds more like economies of scale or something else, not marginal cost. H is probably not right.

Option I is the difference in cost between two levels of production. That could be related. For example, if you produce 10 units versus 11, the difference in cost is the marginal cost for the 11th unit. So I think I is similar to E, but E is more specific to one additional unit. Wait, but I is a bit broader—it's the difference between any two levels, not necessarily just one more unit. So E is more precise.

Option J is the cost of raw materials for all units. That sounds like part of total cost, maybe variable costs, but not specifically marginal cost.

So, putting it all together, marginal cost is the additional cost of producing one more unit. That matches option E. The other options either talk about total costs, fixed costs, average costs, or something else entirely. So I'm pretty confident that E is the correct answer.

The term marginal costs refers to the additional cost incurred by producing one more unit of a good or service. It is calculated as the change in total cost when the production quantity increases by one unit. Marginal cost is an important concept in economics, particularly in production and pricing decisions, as it helps determine the most cost-effective level of production.
