Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about psychotherapies, and I need to figure out which one involves the psychologist self-disclosing as a specific and frequent technique. Let me think through each option one by one.

First, I'll list out the options to get a clear picture:

A: Object relations therapy
B: Play Therapy
C: Interpersonal therapy
D: Narrative Therapy
E: Transactional analysis
F: Dialectical Behavior Therapy
G: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
H: Feminist psychotherapy
I: Gestalt Therapy
J: Exposure Therapy

Hmm, I remember that self-disclosure by the therapist isn't a standard practice in most therapies I know. Most approaches focus on the patient talking about their issues, with the therapist listening and guiding. But some therapies might involve the therapist sharing more about themselves.

Let me think about each option:

A: Object relations therapy. This approach focuses on the dynamics of relationships, especially those formed in early childhood. I don't recall self-disclosure being a key component here. It's more about understanding how past relationships influence current ones, but the therapist's self-disclosure isn't a main technique.

B: Play Therapy. This is used with children, where they express themselves through play. The therapist might use toys, but I don't think they typically disclose much about themselves. It's more about the child's expression and the therapist observing.

C: Interpersonal therapy. This therapy focuses on interpersonal issues and current relationships. The therapist helps the patient explore their social interactions. I think the therapist might share some insights or observations, but I'm not sure if self-disclosure is a specific technique they use often.

D: Narrative Therapy. This approach helps patients construct a coherent narrative of their lives. The therapist might ask questions to help the patient reflect, but I don't think the therapist shares their own stories in this process.

E: Transactional analysis. This is about analyzing transactions between people. The therapist uses this to help the patient understand their interactions. I don't remember self-disclosure being a key part here.

F: Dialectical Behavior Therapy. This is a type of CBT that focuses on teaching coping skills. The therapist's role is to guide the patient in mindfulness and behavioral strategies. I don't think self-disclosure is a main technique.

G: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Similar to DBT, CBT focuses on changing thought patterns. The therapist usually doesn't disclose much about themselves; it's more about the patient's thoughts and behaviors.

H: Feminist psychotherapy. This approach emphasizes gender issues and empowering the patient. While the therapist might be more active in addressing social and political factors, I don't think self-disclosure is a standard technique here.

I: Gestalt Therapy. Now, I'm pretty sure Gestalt Therapy uses a lot of in-the-moment, here-and-now techniques. The therapist might share observations or reflections to help the patient become more aware. I remember that in Gestalt, the therapist sometimes talks about their own feelings or reactions to what the patient is saying. This is to help the patient explore their own experiences by mirroring or reflecting the patient's emotions, which might involve the therapist sharing their perspective.

J: Exposure Therapy. This is a behavioral therapy used to treat anxiety disorders by exposing the patient to feared stimuli in a controlled way. The therapist's role is to guide the exposure and monitor the patient's response. Self-disclosure doesn't seem relevant here.

So, putting it all together, the therapy where the psychologist's self-disclosure is specifically recommended and frequently used is Gestalt Therapy. The reason is that Gestalt emphasizes the present moment and the therapeutic relationship, with the therapist often reflecting the patient's emotions and sharing their own observations to facilitate insight.

The correct answer is I: Gestalt Therapy. In Gestalt Therapy, self-disclosure by the psychologist is a specifically recommended and frequently applied technique. This approach emphasizes the therapeutic relationship and the "here and now," with the therapist often sharing observations or reflections to help the patient gain insight into their experiences.
