Question:

A 17-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department 15 minutes after being stung by a bee. She has mild lightheadedness but no difficulty swallowing. Her temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 30/min, and blood pressure is 115/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no urticaria. Bilateral wheezing is heard on auscultation of the chest. Which of the following types of drugs is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient?

Options:

A: α1-Adrenergic antagonist
B: α1-Adrenergic agonist
C: Non-selective β-Adrenergic antagonist
D: β1-Adrenergic agonist
E: β2-Adrenergic antagonist
F: α2-Adrenergic antagonist
G: β2-Adrenergic agonist
H: Non-selective β-Adrenergic agonist
I: α2-Adrenergic agonist
J: β1-Adrenergic antagonist

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a 17-year-old girl who was stung by a bee and is now in the emergency department. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the patient's symptoms: She was stung 15 minutes ago. She's complaining of mild lightheadedness but doesn't have difficulty swallowing. Her vital signs are temperature 37.1°C, pulse 100/min, respirations 30/min, and blood pressure 115/70 mm Hg. On physical exam, there's no urticaria, but bilateral wheezing is heard. 

So, what's going on here? Bee stings can cause different reactions. The most common are local reactions, which are usually mild and go away on their own. But sometimes, people can have an allergic reaction, which can range from mild to severe (anaphylaxis). 

Looking at her symptoms: She doesn't have urticaria, which is hives, so that's a bit confusing because that's a common sign of an allergic reaction. But she does have wheezing, which suggests some kind of airway obstruction. Her blood pressure is a bit low (115/70) and her pulse is slightly elevated, which might indicate she's having some sort of systemic reaction. The lightheadedness could be due to the drop in blood pressure.

So, the main concern here is probably an allergic reaction, maybe even anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can cause wheezing, difficulty breathing, and hypotension. But in this case, she doesn't have difficulty swallowing, which is another sign sometimes seen in anaphylaxis affecting the throat.

Now, the question is about the most appropriate pharmacotherapy. So, the options are various adrenergic drugs.

Let me recall: Anaphylaxis is treated with epinephrine, which is a beta-adrenergic agonist, specifically a non-selective one because it activates both beta-1 and beta-2 receptors. Beta-2 agonists are more commonly used for asthma, but in severe reactions like anaphylaxis, epinephrine is the go-to because it also has alpha-adrenergic effects, which help with blood pressure.

Looking at the options:

A: α1-Adrenergic antagonist – These are drugs like prazosin, used for high blood pressure. They wouldn't help with wheezing or anaphylaxis.

B: α1-Adrenergic agonist – These are like phenylephrine, used in decongestants. They might help with nasal congestion but not wheezing.

C: Non-selective β-Adrenergic antagonist – These block both beta-1 and beta-2, like propranolol. They would worsen wheezing, which isn't helpful.

D: β1-Adrenergic agonist – These are selective, used for heart conditions. They don't help with bronchospasm.

E: β2-Adrenergic antagonist – These are like albuterol, but they're actually agonists, not antagonists. Wait, no, option E is an antagonist, which would block beta-2 and make wheezing worse.

F: α2-Adrenergic antagonist – Clonidine is an example, used for hypertension. Not relevant here.

G: β2-Adrenergic agonist – Albuterol is used for asthma, but in severe cases, a non-selective like epinephrine is better because it also affects alpha receptors.

H: Non-selective β-Adrenergic agonist – This would be epinephrine or isoproterenol. Perfect for anaphylaxis because they relieve bronchospasm and increase blood pressure.

I: α2-Adrenergic agonist – Drugs like clonidine, used for blood pressure, not relevant.

J: β1-Adrenergic antagonist – These are like atenolol, used for heart rate control, not helpful here.

So, the most appropriate drug would be a non-selective beta-adrenergic agonist, which is option H. Epinephrine fits this because it's a non-selective beta agonist and is the standard treatment for anaphylaxis. It helps with the wheezing by relaxing the bronchial smooth muscles and also helps with the blood pressure by increasing it through alpha effects.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused between G and H. Option G is a β2-agonist, which is used for asthma, but in severe cases, you need the combined effect of epinephrine, which is non-selective. So H is the correct choice because it's non-selective, providing both beta-1 and beta-2 effects, which are necessary in this case.

The patient presents with symptoms indicative of an allergic reaction following a bee sting, including wheezing and mild hypotension. The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for anaphylaxis is a non-selective β-Adrenergic agonist, such as epinephrine, which provides both beta-1 and beta-2 effects to relieve bronchospasm and increase blood pressure. 

Answer: H
