Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here. Let me read it again and try to figure out what I need to do. The question is asking about the change in entropy when 25 kJ of energy is transferred reversibly and isothermally as heat to a large block of iron at 100 degrees Celsius. Hmm, right, entropy change for a reversible process.

I remember that entropy change, ΔS, for a reversible process at constant temperature is given by the formula ΔS = Q_rev / T. But wait, I need to make sure I'm using the right units here. The heat transfer Q is given in kilojoules, and the temperature is in Celsius, so I should convert that to Kelvin first.

The temperature is 100 degrees Celsius. To convert that to Kelvin, I add 273.15. So 100 + 273.15 = 373.15 K. Got that down.

The heat transferred is 25 kJ, which is 25,000 J. Because entropy is in J/(K·mol) or just J/K in this case, I think. Since the formula uses joules, I'll convert the 25 kJ to 25,000 J to keep the units consistent.

So plugging into the formula: ΔS = 25,000 J / 373.15 K. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 25000 divided by 373.15. Let me approximate this division. Well, 373 times 67 is about 25,000 because 373 * 60 is 22,380, and 373 * 7 is 2,611, so together that's about 24,991. Wait, that's pretty close. So 67 J/K? Or maybe I should do a more precise calculation.

Wait, 373.15 * 67 = let me compute: 373 * 60 is 22,380, 373 *7 is 2,611, so 22,380 + 2,611 = 24,991. Then 0.15 *67 is about 10.05, so total is 24,991 +10.05=25,001.05. Wow, that's almost exactly 25,000. So 25,000 J divided by 373.15 K is approximately 67 J/K.

Looking at the options, H is 67 J/K. So I think the correct answer is H.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says it's a large block of iron. Does that affect anything? Oh, right, because for a large block, the temperature change would be negligible, so it's effectively at constant temperature. So using the formula ΔS = Q_rev / T is appropriate here. Also, since it's a reversible process, the entropy change is maximal, but since it's isothermal and reversible, the formula should hold.

So yeah, I'm confident that the answer is 67 J/K, which is option H.

The entropy change (ΔS) for a reversible isothermal process is calculated using the formula:

\[
\Delta S = \frac{Q_{\text{rev}}}{T}
\]

Given:
- Heat transfer, \( Q_{\text{rev}} = 25 \, \text{kJ} = 25,000 \, \text{J} \)
- Temperature, \( T = 100^\circ \text{C} = 373.15 \, \text{K} \)

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta S = \frac{25,000}{373.15} \approx 67 \, \text{J/K}
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

H
