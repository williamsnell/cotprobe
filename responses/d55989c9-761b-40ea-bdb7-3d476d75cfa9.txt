Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the heat required to convert 10 grams of ice at 0°C to vapor at 100°C. Hmm, I remember from my chemistry class that there are a few steps involved in this process. Let me think through each step carefully.

First, I think I need to consider the different phases of water here. Ice is solid, then it melts into water, which is liquid, and then that water heats up to 100°C, and finally, it evaporates into vapor. So there are three main parts: melting the ice, heating the water, and then vaporizing it.

Let me jot down the given values to keep things clear. The mass of the ice is 10 grams. The heat of fusion (which is the heat required to melt the ice) is 80 cal/g. The heat of vaporization (the heat needed to turn water into vapor) is 540 cal/g. And the specific heat capacity of water is 1 cal/g°C. Oh right, specific heat is the amount of heat needed to change the temperature of a gram of a substance by one degree Celsius.

Okay, so the first step is melting the ice. Since the ice is at 0°C and needs to turn into water at 0°C, I don't need to worry about temperature change here, just the phase change. So the heat required for melting (Q1) would be mass times heat of fusion. That's Q1 = 10 g * 80 cal/g. Let me calculate that: 10 * 80 is 800 calories. So Q1 is 800 calories.

Next, after the ice is melted into water at 0°C, I need to heat this water up to 100°C. The formula here is Q = mass * specific heat * temperature change. The specific heat is 1 cal/g°C, so that's easy. The temperature change is from 0 to 100, which is 100°C. So Q2 = 10 g * 1 cal/g°C * 100°C. That's 10 * 1 * 100, which equals 1000 calories. Wait, no, wait, 10 * 100 is 1000, right? So Q2 is 1000 calories.

Wait, no, wait, 10 times 100 is actually 1000. Yeah, that's correct. So Q2 is 1000 calories.

Then, once the water is at 100°C, it needs to turn into vapor. That's the phase change from liquid to gas, so I use the heat of vaporization. Q3 = mass * heat of vaporization. So that's 10 g * 540 cal/g. Let me compute that: 10 times 540 is 5400 calories. So Q3 is 5400 calories.

Now, the total heat required is the sum of Q1, Q2, and Q3. So adding them up: 800 (melting) + 1000 (heating) + 5400 (vaporizing). Let's do the math step by step. 800 + 1000 is 1800, and 1800 + 5400 is 7200 calories. So the total heat required is 7200 calories.

Looking at the options, option C is 7200 calories. So I think the answer is C.

To determine the heat required to convert 10 g of ice at 0°C to vapor at 100°C, we calculate three steps:

1. **Melting Ice (Q₁):**  
   \( Q₁ = m \times \text{heat of fusion} = 10 \, \text{g} \times 80 \, \text{cal/g} = 800 \, \text{calories} \)

2. **Heating Water (Q₂):**  
   \( Q₂ = m \times c \times \Delta T = 10 \, \text{g} \times 1 \, \text{cal/g°C} \times 100 \, \text{°C} = 1000 \, \text{calories} \)

3. **Vaporizing Water (Q₃):**  
   \( Q₃ = m \times \text{heat of vaporization} = 10 \, \text{g} \times 540 \, \text{cal/g} = 5400 \, \text{calories} \)

**Total Heat:**  
\( Q_{\text{total}} = Q₁ + Q₂ + Q₃ = 800 + 1000 + 5400 = 7200 \, \text{calories} \)

The correct answer is **C: 7200 calories**.
