Okay, so I've got this question about fertilization and the acrosome and cortical reactions. Hmm. I remember from my biology class that when a sperm meets an egg, some reactions happen to prevent other sperm from fertilizing it. Let me think.

The question is asking what these reactions ensure. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the right one. So, the acrosome reaction is when the sperm's acrosome releases enzymes to help it penetrate the egg. Right, and then there's the cortical reaction, which I think involves the egg's cells reacting to prevent multiple sperm from getting in.

Wait, I think the main point is that once a sperm enters, the egg changes to block others. So the acrosome and cortical reactions probably prevent more than one sperm from fertilizing the egg. So looking at the options, which one says that only one sperm fertilizes the egg.

Option F says "The sperm will fertilize the ovum." That sounds a bit off because it's a bit general. Option I says multiple sperms will fertilize the egg, which is the opposite of what I'm thinking. Option F is about the sperm fertilizing, but I'm pretty sure the reactions are about ensuring only one does.

Option F is a bit vague because it just says "the sperm" as if any, but the correct thing is that only one does. So looking again, maybe option F is correct, but perhaps there's a better option.

Wait, option F says "One and only one sperm will fertilize the egg." Oh wait, looking back, I think I mixed up the options. Let me check again: option F is "One and only one sperm will fertilize the egg." Oh, yes, that's the one I was thinking of. So the acrosome and cortical reactions ensure that only one sperm enters, so the correct answer would be F.

The acrosome and cortical reactions are processes that occur during fertilization to ensure that only one sperm successfully fertilizes the egg. The acrosome reaction allows the sperm to penetrate the egg's outer layers, while the cortical reaction triggers changes in the egg's membrane to prevent additional sperm from entering. This ensures that only one sperm fertilizes the egg, preventing polyspermy.

Answer: F
