Okay, so I have this question about Hume's attack on natural law. I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy, but I'll try to think it through. 

First, I remember that David Hume was a Scottish philosopher, and he's known for his work in empiricism and skepticism. His critique of natural law probably relates to his broader skepticism about metaphysics and the idea of innate principles.

Natural law, as I understand it, refers to the notion that there are certain moral principles that are inherent in human nature and discoverable through reason. Thinkers like Thomas Aquinas or John Locke have discussed natural law in the context of ethics and governance.

Hume's main arguments often focus on the limits of human knowledge. He's famous for saying that you can't derive an 'ought' from an 'is' â€” meaning you can't infer moral conclusions (what ought to be) from purely descriptive statements (what is). This is part of his attack on rationalism, where he argues that reason alone can't determine what is right or wrong; instead, our moral judgments are based on emotions and sentiments.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one aligns with Hume's critique of natural law. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: No universal agreement on natural law. That might be true, but I think Hume's issue is more about the basis of knowing natural law, not just disagreement.

Option B: Natural law is arbitrary. Hmm, Hume might argue that without a foundation in empiricism, it could be seen as arbitrary, but I'm not sure if this is the main point.

Option C: Doesn't apply to all cultures. That's more about relativism, which might be a point, but I think Hume's attack is more about the basis of knowledge.

Option D: Backward-looking. Not sure. Natural law could be seen as looking to inherent principles, but I don't think that's Hume's main issue.

Option E: No social contract. Wait, Hume did discuss the social contract, but this question is about natural law, so maybe not directly relevant.

Option F: Can't objectively know right or wrong. This seems close. Hume's empiricism suggests that we can't have objective knowledge of moral truths because they're based on sentiment, not reason.

Option G: Outdated. That's more of a descriptive statement, not an argument Hume would make.

Option H: Not based on empirical evidence. Yes, Hume was critical of theories not grounded in experience. Natural law, being more metaphysical, wouldn't rely on empirical evidence.

Option I: Fails to protect the state. That sounds more like a political critique, perhaps from someone concerned with state sovereignty, not Hume's main point.

Option J: Doesn't consider individual rights. Maybe, but I think Hume's critique is more about the basis of knowledge rather than the content of natural law.

So, Hume's argument is that we can't have objective knowledge of moral truths. He thinks moral judgments are based on feelings, not reason. Therefore, natural law, which relies on objective moral principles, is flawed because such principles can't be known objectively. 

Wait, looking back, option F says we can't objectively know right or wrong. That aligns with Hume's position. Similarly, option H says natural law isn't based on empirical evidence, which is true because natural law is more about a priori principles. 

Hmm, which one is the better fit? The question is about Hume's attack on natural law. He argues that natural law is based on a flawed assumption that we can know objective moral truths. Since he denies that we can have such knowledge, the foundation of natural law is shaky. So, his attack is that we can't know what's morally right or wrong objectively, making natural law's basis invalid.

So, the answer would be F: We cannot objectively know what is morally right or wrong.

Hume's critique of natural law centers on his empiricist and skeptical views, arguing that moral principles are not derived from reason but from sentiment. He famously contended that we cannot derive 'ought' from 'is,' meaning moral conclusions cannot be inferred from descriptive statements. This leads to his assertion that we cannot objectively know what is morally right or wrong, undermining the foundation of natural law, which relies on objective moral principles.

Answer: F
