Okay, so I've got this question about group theory, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The group G is given as {2, 4, 6, 8} under multiplication modulo 10. The question is asking for the identity element in this group. The options are A to J, with possible answers like 9, 7, 8, etc. 

First, I remember that in group theory, an identity element is an element e such that when you combine it with any element a in the group using the group operation (which here is multiplication modulo 10), you get a back. So, for all a in G, a * e ≡ a mod 10. That's the key property.

Now, I need to find which element in G acts as this identity. Let's list out the elements again: 2, 4, 6, 8. The options given include numbers like 1, 3, 5, etc., but wait, G only contains 2,4,6,8. So the identity must be one of these four numbers, right? Because the group is closed under the operation, so the identity must be an element of G itself.

Wait, but wait a second. The question gives options like D:1, which isn't in G. So maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the group is being considered in a larger context, but I think the group G is defined as {2,4,6,8}, so the identity must be within these elements. Hmm, but that's a conflict because 1 isn't in G. So perhaps the group is a subset of a larger set, but the identity must be within G.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The group operation is multiplication modulo 10, but the group G is {2,4,6,8}, so let's check each element to see if it acts as an identity.

I'll start by checking each element e in G to see if for every a in G, a * e ≡ a mod 10.

Let's list the elements of G: 2,4,6,8.

Let me test e=2 first. For each a in G, multiply by 2 modulo 10 and see if it equals a.

- a=2: 2*2=4 mod10 → 4 ≠ 2. So e=2 is not identity.
- a=4: 4*2=8 mod10 → 8 ≠4. Not identity.
- a=6:6*2=12 mod10 → 2. 2≠6. Not identity.
- a=8:8*2=16 mod10 →6. Not 8. So e=2 is out.

Next, e=4.

- a=2:2*4=8 mod10 →8≠2. Not identity.
- a=4:4*4=16 mod10 →6≠4. Not identity.
- a=6:6*4=24 mod10 →4≠6. Not identity.
- a=8:8*4=32 mod10 →2≠8. So e=4 isn't identity either.

Now, e=6.

- a=2:2*6=12 mod10 →2. So 2=2. Good so far.
- a=4:4*6=24 mod10 →4. 4=4. Good.
- a=6:6*6=36 mod10 →6. 6=6. Good.
- a=8:8*6=48 mod10 →8. 8=8. So for all a in G, a*6 ≡a mod10. That seems to work. So e=6 could be the identity.

Wait, but let me check e=8 just to be thorough.

e=8:

- a=2:2*8=16 mod10 →6≠2. So already fails. So e=8 isn't the identity.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about it, I thought maybe 6 is the identity because when I multiplied 2,4,6,8 by 6, I got back the same elements. Let me confirm:

2*6=12 →2 mod10 →2. Correct.

4*6=24 →4 mod10 →4. Correct.

6*6=36 →6 mod10 →6. Correct.

8*6=48 →8 mod10 →8. Correct.

So yes, 6 acts as the identity element in this group under multiplication modulo 10.

Wait, but wait a moment. I also thought that in some groups, the identity is 1, but 1 isn't in G. So maybe 6 is the identity here because it's the element that leaves others unchanged when multiplied modulo 10.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the group operation. Let me think again about the group structure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the Cayley table for G under multiplication modulo 10 and see which element acts as the identity.

Let me try that. The Cayley table would have rows and columns as the elements of G, and each cell would be the product of row element and column element modulo 10.

So, the elements are 2,4,6,8.

Let me construct the table:

         2   4   6   8
    2   ?   ?   ?   ?
    4   ?   ?   ?   ?
    6   ?   ?   ?   ?
    8   ?   ?   ?   ?

Let's compute each cell:

2*2=4 mod10 →4
2*4=8 mod10 →8
2*6=12 mod10 →2
2*8=16 mod10 →6

4*2=8 mod10 →8
4*4=16 mod10 →6
4*6=24 mod10 →4
4*8=32 mod10 →2

6*2=12 mod10 →2
6*4=24 mod10 →4
6*6=36 mod10 →6
6*8=48 mod10 →8

8*2=16 mod10 →6
8*4=32 mod10 →2
8*6=48 mod10 →8
8*8=64 mod10 →4

So the table looks like:

         2   4   6   8
    2   4   8   2   6
    4   8   6   4   2
    6   2   4   6   8
    8   6   2   8   4

Now, looking for the identity element: it's the element in the first row and column that leaves the row elements unchanged when multiplied. Alternatively, the diagonal should have the elements themselves if they're being multiplied by the identity.

Looking at the first row: 4,8,2,6. Hmm, not matching the top row (2,4,6,8). So 2 is not the identity.

Looking at the third row (6): 2,4,6,8. That's exactly the order of the elements in G. So when 6 is multiplied by each element, the result is the same as the original element. So 6 is the identity.

Similarly, looking at the third column: for each row, the element under 6 is the same as the row's first element. For example:

Row 2: 2*6=2 → correct.
Row 4:4*6=4 → correct.
Row 6:6*6=6 → correct.
Row 8:8*6=8 → correct.

So yes, 6 is the identity element in this group under multiplication modulo 10.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the identity element in multiplication is usually 1, but in this group, 1 isn't present. So perhaps the group isn't a standard multiplicative group, and 6 serves as the identity here.

Wait another thought: perhaps the group operation is not standard multiplication modulo 10, but something else. But the question states it's under multiplication modulo 10. So perhaps the group is a subset of integers mod 10 that is closed under multiplication modulo 10, and in this case, 6 is the identity.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check if 6 is indeed the identity by testing each element.

As done earlier, multiplying each element by 6 gives back the same element. So 2*6=12→2, 4*6=24→4, 6*6=36→6, 8*6=48→8. So yes, 6 is the identity.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option I:6.
</think>

The identity element in the group G = {2, 4, 6, 8} under multiplication modulo 10 is 6, as it satisfies the property that multiplying any element by 6 modulo 10 returns the original element.
