Okay, so I've got this question about photomicrography and resolving two points using ultraviolet light. Hmm, I remember that this has something to do with the diffraction limit of light and something called the Rayleigh criterion. Wait, right, the smallest distance that can be resolved is given by the Rayleigh formula. 

The question gives me the wavelength as 2750 A°, which I think is 2750 angstroms. Oh wait, 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so that's 2750e-10 meters. Let me write that down as 2.75e-7 meters. Wait, no, wait. 2750 A is 2750 x 1e-10 m, which is 2.75e-7 meters? Wait, no, 2750 A is 2750 x 1e-10 m = 2.75 x 1e-7 m. Yes, because 1e-10 is 0.1 nanometer, and 2750 of those is 0.275 nm, which is 2.75e-7 meters. Right.

The numerical aperture (NA) is given as 0.85. So the formula I remember is the resolving power, which is the minimum distance d between two points that can be resolved. The Rayleigh criterion says that d is approximately equal to (1.22 * wavelength) / (2 * NA). Wait, or is it (1.22 * wavelength) divided by (2 * NA)? Let me think. Oh right, the formula is d = (1.22 * λ) / (2 * NA). Because the formula is d = (1.22 λ) / (2 NA), right? Or wait, sometimes it's written as d = (λ / (2 NA)) * 1.22. Either way, same thing.

So plugging in the numbers: λ is 2.75e-7 meters. Numerical aperture NA is 0.85. So let's compute that.

First, calculate the numerator: 1.22 * λ. 1.22 * 2.75e-7. Let me compute 2.75 * 1.22. 2 times 1.22 is 2.44, 0.75 *1.22 is around 0.915. So total is 2.44 + 0.915 = 3.355. So 3.355e-7 meters.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, λ is 2.75e-7 meters, so 1.22 * 2.75e-7 = 1.22 * 2.75 = about 3.355, so 3.355e-7 m. Then divide by 2 * NA, which is 2 *0.85 =1.7.

So d = 3.355e-7 / 1.7. Let me compute that. 3.355 divided by 1.7. Hmm, 1.7 times 2 is 3.4. So 3.355 is just a bit less than 3.4, so around 1.9735. So 1.9735e-7 meters.

Looking at the options, option G is 1.97e-7 m. So the answer should be G.

The smallest distance between two points that can be resolved is calculated using the Rayleigh criterion formula: \( d = \frac{1.22 \lambda}{2 \cdot \text{NA}} \). Substituting the given wavelength (\( \lambda = 2.75 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \)) and numerical aperture (NA = 0.85), the distance is found to be approximately \( 1.97 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \). 

Answer: G
