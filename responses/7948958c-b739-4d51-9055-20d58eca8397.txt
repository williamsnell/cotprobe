Okay, so I need to figure out which option correctly answers the question: "Charles Darwin was the first person to propose..." The options are A through J, and I have to choose the correct one. Let me go through each option one by one.

First, I know Charles Darwin is famous for his work on evolution. I remember he proposed something about natural selection. But wait, wasn't there someone else before him who had similar ideas? Oh right, maybe Alfred Russel Wallace also came up with the idea of natural selection around the same time. But the question is about who was first to propose each of these, so I might need to think carefully.

Option A: that humans evolved from apes. I think Darwin did discuss human evolution, but I'm not sure if he was the first to propose that humans came from apes. I recall that before Darwin, some people like Lamarck had ideas about evolution, but maybe not specifically about humans and apes. But I'm not certain if this was his first proposal or if someone else came before.

Option B: that evolution occurs. I believe Darwin's theory was about evolution, but I think others before him, like Lamarck, had theories of evolution too. So B might not be correct because he wasn't the first to propose that evolution happens.

Option C: that evolution occurs through a process of gradual change. Darwin's theory did involve gradual change over time, but I'm not sure if he was the first to suggest that. I think others might have had similar ideas about gradualism in evolution.

Option D: that the Earth is older than a few thousand years. Darwin probably needed an old Earth for his theories to make sense, but I'm not sure if he was the first to propose that. Other scientists, perhaps in geology, might have already suggested an older Earth.

Option E: a mechanism for how evolution occurs. Darwin proposed natural selection as the mechanism. But was he the first? Wallace also proposed it around the same time, I think. So maybe E is correct, but I'm not entirely sure if he was first.

Option F: a mechanism for evolution that was supported by evidence. Darwin definitely provided evidence for natural selection. I think this is a strong candidate because he not only proposed the mechanism but also backed it with observations and evidence from his travels, like in the Gal√°pagos Islands.

Option G: a complete taxonomy of all known species. No, I don't think Darwin was into classifying species entirely. Taxonomy is more about classification, which others like Linnaeus were famous for. So G is probably not correct.

Option H: the idea of natural selection. Yes, Darwin is known for this. But again, Wallace also came up with it independently. So was Darwin the first? I think they both proposed it around the same time, but Darwin published first, so he might be considered the first.

Option I: the theory of relativity. No way, that's Einstein's thing. So I can rule out I.

Option J: the concept of genetic inheritance. That's more Mendel's work, right? Mendel's laws on genetics came before Darwin, so J isn't correct.

So narrowing down, the main contenders are E, F, and H. The question is about who was the first to propose each. Since both Darwin and Wallace proposed natural selection around the same time, but Darwin published earlier, H might be correct. However, F says a mechanism supported by evidence. Darwin's work was comprehensive with evidence, so F could also be correct. Alternatively, E is about a mechanism, which both H and E touch on. Wait, E says a mechanism for how evolution occurs, which is exactly natural selection. So E and H are related. H is about the idea of natural selection, while E is about the mechanism of evolution.

Wait, the question is about what Darwin was the first to propose. So looking at the options:

A: humans from apes - maybe he wasn't first.
B: evolution occurs - others proposed this.
C: gradual change - maybe others had similar ideas.
D: Earth's age - others in geology.
E: mechanism (natural selection) for evolution.
F: mechanism with evidence.
H: natural selection.

So the question is, was Darwin the first to propose a mechanism (E) or the idea of natural selection (H)? Since natural selection is the mechanism, H is more specific. Alternatively, E is the broader statement about a mechanism, which Darwin provided as natural selection.

But looking at the options, E says "a mechanism for how evolution occurs." H says "the idea of natural selection." So both are correct in a way, but the wording of the options matters.

The question is about what Darwin was the first to propose. So if the question is about the mechanism (E), then E is correct. But if it's about the specific idea of natural selection, then H is correct.

Wait, the exact wording of the options:

E: a mechanism for how evolution occurs.
H: the idea of natural selection.

So E is a broader statement, while H is the specific mechanism. Since Darwin proposed natural selection as the mechanism, H is the specific answer. But I'm a bit confused because some sources say that both Darwin and Wallace proposed natural selection around the same time, so who was first? I think Darwin's publication in 1859 (Origin of Species) was before Wallace's paper, which was presented to the Linnean Society in the same year but after Darwin's manuscript was discussed. So Darwin is considered the first to publish, making H correct.

Alternatively, F says a mechanism supported by evidence. Darwin's mechanism was supported, so F could be correct, but the question is about who was first to propose it, not necessarily the evidence part. So perhaps E is correct because he proposed the mechanism, and F is about supporting it with evidence, which he did, but the first proposal would be E.

Wait, the question is about the first person to propose each option. So if E is about the mechanism, and H is about the idea of natural selection, then H is more specific and correct because that's exactly what Darwin proposed. So the answer should be H.

The correct answer is H. Charles Darwin was the first to propose the idea of natural selection as the mechanism for evolution. While others may have contributed to related concepts, Darwin's specific proposal of natural selection was groundbreaking and widely recognized as his major contribution.
