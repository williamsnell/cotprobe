Question:

An internal hash table has 5 buckets, numbered 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Keys are integers, and the hash function h(i) = i mod 5 is used, with linear resolution of collisions (i.e., if bucket h(i) is filled, the buckets h(i) + 1, h(i) + 2, ... are tried successively with all bucket numbers computed modulo 5). If elements with keys 13, 8, 24, 10, and 3 are inserted, m that order, into an initially blank hash table, then the content of the bucket numbered 2 is

Options:

A: 10
B: 8
C: 10 and 24
D: Empty
E: 24
F: 3
G: 10 and 3
H: 3 and 8
I: 13
J: 13 and 8

Okay, so I have this question about hash tables, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The hash table has 5 buckets, numbered 0 to 4. The keys are integers, and the hash function is h(i) = i mod 5. So for any key, I take the key number, divide by 5, and the remainder is the bucket number. If the bucket is full, we use linear probing, which means we check the next buckets in order, wrapping around if necessary since it's modulo 5.

The elements to insert are 13, 8, 24, 10, and 3, in that order. I need to find what's in bucket number 2 after all insertions.

First, I'll list each key and compute its initial hash.

1. Key 13: 13 mod 5. 5*2=10, so 13-10=3. So h(13)=3. So it goes into bucket 3.

2. Key 8: 8 mod5. 5*1=5, 8-5=3. So h(8)=3. So next spot is bucket 3, but it's already taken by 13. So we go to 4 (since 3+1=4 mod5 is 4). Is bucket 4 empty? Let's see. Wait, wait, no, I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me proceed step by step.

Let me make a list of the buckets as they get filled.

Initialize all buckets as empty: [0,1,2,3,4] = empty.

Insert 13:
h(13)=3. Bucket 3 is empty, so place 13 there. Now buckets are [0,1,2,13,4].

Insert 8:
h(8)=3. Bucket 3 is occupied. Next, h=3+1=4 mod5=4. Check bucket4: empty. So place 8 there. Now buckets: [0,1,2,13,8].

Insert 24:
h(24)=24 mod5. 5*4=20, 24-20=4. So h=4. Check bucket4: already has 8. So next is 4+1=5 mod5=0. Check bucket0: empty. Place 24 there. Now buckets: [24,1,2,13,8].

Insert 10:
h(10)=10 mod5=0. Check bucket0: has 24. Next is 0+1=1 mod5=1. Check bucket1: empty. Place 10 there. Now: [24,10,2,13,8].

Insert 3:
h(3)=3 mod5=3. Check bucket3: has 13. Next is 4: has 8. Next is 0: has 24. Next is1: has 10. Next is2: empty. So place 3 in bucket2. Now, bucket2 has 3.

Wait, but let me double-check each step because I might have made a mistake.

Let me go through each step again.

Insert 13:
h=3. Bucket3 is empty. So it's placed there. So bucket3:13.

Insert 8:
h=3. Bucket3 is taken. So next is 4. Bucket4 is empty. So place 8 there. So bucket4:8.

Insert 24:
h=24 mod5=4. Bucket4 is taken. Next is 0. Bucket0 is empty. Place 24 there. So bucket0:24.

Insert 10:
h=0. Bucket0 has 24. Next is 1. Bucket1 is empty. Place 10. So bucket1:10.

Insert 3:
h=3. Bucket3 has 13. Next is 4: has 8. Next is 0: has24. Next is1: has10. Next is2: empty. So place 3 in bucket2.

Now, the buckets are:

0:24, 1:10, 2:3, 3:13,4:8.

So the question is, what's in bucket2? It's 3. So looking at the options, option F is 3.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Options:

A:10, B:8, C:10 and24, D:empty, E:24, F:3, G:10 and3, H:3 and8, I:13, J:13 and8.

So the correct answer is F:3.

Wait, but wait a minute. Did I make a mistake earlier? Because when I inserted 3, I thought it went into bucket2. Let me check again.

3 mod5 is 3. So first bucket3 is taken, so next is4, then0, then1, then2. So yes, 3 goes into bucket2.

So the content of bucket2 is 3, which is option F.

The content of bucket 2 is 3.

Answer: F
