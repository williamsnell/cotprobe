Question:

You bought a limousine for $98,000 and are planning to rent it for weddings, ceremonies and parties at $245 per hour. If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?

Options:

A: 150%
B: 0.45%
C: 0.164%
D: 1.64%
E: 183%
F: 2.45%
G: 245%
H: 164%
I: 75%
J: 200%

Okay, so I need to figure out the estimated yearly yield on the investment for the limousine. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the initial investment is $98,000. The limo is rented out for $245 per hour, and it's used for 2 hours a day on average. So each day, the income from renting would be 2 hours multiplied by $245. Let me calculate that: 2 * 245 = $490 per day.

Next, there are daily costs of about $50. So the net profit each day would be the income minus the daily costs. That's $490 - $50 = $440 per day.

Now, since the limo is used every day of the year, including weekends and holidays, that's 365 days. So the total yearly income would be $440 * 365. Let me compute that: 440 * 300 is 132,000, and 440 * 65 is 28,600, so adding them together gives 160,600. Wait, actually, 440 * 365 is better calculated as 440 * (300+60+5) = 440*300=132,000, 440*60=26,400, 440*5=2,200. Adding those together: 132k +26.4k = 158.4k +2.2k = 160,600. So the total revenue is $160,600 per year.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, actually, the $440 is the net profit per day, right? Because we subtracted the daily costs. So the yearly net profit is 440 * 365. Let me compute that: 440 * 365.

Alternatively, 365 * 400 is 146,000, and 365 * 40 is 14,600, so 146k +14.6k = 160,600. So the net profit per year is $160,600.

Wait, but wait a second. The initial investment is $98,000. So the yield would be the net profit divided by the initial investment, then multiplied by 100 to get a percentage.

So yield = (Net Profit / Investment) * 100 = (160,600 / 98,000) * 100.

Calculating 160,600 divided by 98,000. Let's see, 98,000 * 1.6 is 156,800. Because 98 *1.6=156.8, so 98,000 *1.6=156,800. Then, 160,600 -156,800 = 3,800. So 3,800 /98,000 is approximately 0.03878. So 1.6 + 0.03878 â‰ˆ 1.63878, which is approximately 1.64 times the investment. So the yield is about 164%.

Looking at the options, H is 1.64%, but wait, no, wait, H is 1.64%. Wait, that's not right. Wait, 1.64 times is 164%, right? Because 1.64 times the investment would be a 164% return. So the yield is 164%, which is option H.

Wait, but let me double-check. Net profit is $160,600 per year. So the yield is 160,600 /98,000 = approximately 1.6387755, which is about 163.88%, so roughly 164%, which is option H.

The estimated yearly yield on the investment is approximately 164%, so the correct answer is H.
