Question:

In which of the following situations would the defendant most likely be found NOT GUILTY of robbery?

Options:

A: A defendant approached a man on the street and asked for his wallet. The man refused and the defendant threatened him with a knife. The man handed over his wallet and the defendant ran away.
B: A defendant was walking behind a shopper in a mall when he suddenly reached for her gold chain, pulled it from her neck, and ran away into the crowd. The shopper suffered a slight cut on her neck where the chain broke.
C: A defendant was shopping in a grocery store when he noticed a woman's purse in the shopping cart unattended. He quickly took the purse and left the store.
D: A defendant broke into a house and took a stereo system. After he had placed the system in his car and was about to leave, the homeowner came home and saw him. She raced to the car and started to hit the defendant through the open window in an attempt to get her stereo back. The defendant punched her in the nose and drove away with the system.
E: In a dark alley, a defendant approached the victim and said, "Give me the gold ring on your finger or I'll shoot you with this gun. " The victim gave him the ring. However, the ring really belonged to someone else, as the victim was just borrowing it for the evening to impress his girlfriend. In addition, the gun that the defendant had in his possession was really a water pistol.
F: A defendant walked into a bank and handed a note to the teller demanding money. The teller gave him the money and he left the bank.
G: A defendant found a lost wallet on the street. He took the money and cards from the wallet and threw it in the trash.
H: A defendant entered a store and asked the cashier to show him a necklace. When the cashier turned around to get the necklace, the defendant took money from the cash register and ran away.
I: A defendant picked the lock on an apartment door. The noise startled the tenant, who had been sleeping. The defendant overpowered the tenant, tied him up, and forced him to disclose where he kept his money. The tenant told the defendant to look in the kitchen cabinet, which he did. The defendant found $120 in cash, took the money, and left the apartment.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about when a defendant would most likely be found NOT GUILTY of robbery. I need to figure out which situation fits that. Let me go through each option one by one.

First, I should remember what robbery entails. Robbery is typically defined as the felonious taking of someone's property, directly from their person, with force or threat of force, and with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of that property. So, for a robbery charge, the taking needs to be from the person, immediate, and involve some form of threat or force.

Let's look at each option:

Option A: The defendant approached a man on the street, asked for his wallet. The man refused, so the defendant threatened him with a knife. Then the man handed over his wallet, and the defendant ran away. This seems like a clear case of robbery because the defendant used a knife to threaten the man, took the wallet directly from him. So, he'd likely be guilty.

Option B: The defendant was behind a shopper in a mall and reached for her gold chain, pulled it, and ran. The shopper had a slight cut. Here, the defendant took something directly from her person using force (pulling the chain caused a cut). So, this is robbery too. She was immediately present, and force was used.

Option C: The defendant took a woman's purse from an unattended shopping cart in a grocery store. This sounds more like theft because the purse wasn't attended. There's no direct confrontation or force involved. So, maybe not robbery. The person wasn't present, so it's not robbery.

Option D: The defendant broke into a house, took a stereo, and when the homeowner came home, she tried to get it back, so he punched her and left. This involves breaking into a house, which is burglary, but when he took the stereo, that's larceny. However, when the homeowner confronted him, he used force (punching her). So, does that make it robbery? I think so because he used force to retain the property, but the initial taking was without the homeowner's presence. Hmm, this might be tricky. Some jurisdictions might consider it robbery because he used force in the commission of the felony.

Option E: The defendant approached the victim in a dark alley, threatened with a gun to get the gold ring, but the gun was a water pistol, and the ring belonged to someone else. The victim gave the ring. So, the defendant used a threat of force (even if the gun wasn't real, the victim believed it was). So, it's robbery because the intent was to take property through fear, regardless of the gun's reality. The fact that the ring wasn't his might not matter for robbery, just that he took it through force.

Option F: The defendant walked into a bank, handed a note, and the teller gave him money. This sounds like a bank robbery, but without any immediate threat of force. He just handed a note, which is a type of robbery (armed or not, but in this case, no weapon shown). Wait, but a bank robbery can be under the guise of a note, so it's still robbery. So, he would be guilty.

Option G: The defendant found a lost wallet on the street, took the money and cards, and threw the wallet away. Since the wallet was unattended and he didn't take it from someone's person, this is theft, not robbery. So, no robbery here.

Option H: The defendant entered a store, asked the cashier for a necklace, and when she turned around, he took money from the cash register and ran. So, he tricked the cashier into looking away and then took the money. This seems more like theft because he didn't use force or threat; he just took advantage of the moment when she wasn't looking. So, not robbery.

Option I: The defendant broke into an apartment, overpowered the tenant, tied him up, and forced him to disclose where the money was. Then he took the money. This involves force and taking property directly from the person (since the tenant had to show where the money was, and the defendant took it). So, this is robbery because he used force to get the information and then took the money.

So, looking for the situation where the defendant is NOT guilty. The key is to find a situation where the elements of robbery aren't met. Robbery requires taking directly from the person with force or threat.

Option C: Taking the purse from an unattended cart—no person involved, so not robbery. It's theft, which is a different crime. So, in this case, the defendant would not be guilty of robbery because there was no direct taking from the person; it was from an unattended place.

Similarly, Option G is theft, not robbery. So, the defendant in G would not be guilty of robbery.

Wait, the question is which situation would the defendant be found NOT GUILTY of robbery. So, the correct answer would be the one where it's not robbery at all.

Looking again, C and G are theft. Let's check the options again.

The question asks which situation would the defendant be found NOT GUILTY of robbery. So, the defendant didn't commit robbery in that situation.

Looking at all the options, the ones that are definitely not robbery are C and G. But let's see the options again.

Wait, the options are A to I. Let me check which are not robbery.

Option C: Taking an unattended purse—definitely theft, not robbery.

Option G: Found a wallet on the street, took money—also theft, not robbery.

So, the question is which situation would the defendant most likely be found NOT GUILTY of robbery. So, the answer would be either C or G.

Wait, the options are A-I, and I need to pick one.

Looking back, the options are:

C: defendant took a purse from an unattended cart.

G: defendant found a lost wallet on the street, took money and cards.

So, both C and G are theft, not robbery.

But the question is about robbery, so in both C and G, the defendant didn't commit robbery. So, why are both options present? Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, the question is which situation would the defendant most likely be found NOT GUILTY of robbery. So, the correct answer would be either C or G.

But looking at the options, the question is which situation would result in NOT GUILTY. So, perhaps the correct answer is C or G.

Wait, perhaps I missed something. Let me think again.

In robbery, the taking must be from the person's immediate presence. So, in C, the purse was in a shopping cart, unattended. The woman wasn't there, so it's theft. In G, the wallet was on the street, unattended. So, the defendant didn't take it from someone's presence. So, both C and G are theft, not robbery. But the question is about robbery, so in both cases, the defendant wouldn't be guilty of robbery.

But the question gives only one correct answer. So, perhaps I need to see which one is more clearly not robbery.

Wait, perhaps in Option C, the woman was shopping, so the purse was in the cart. If she was nearby, maybe it's considered from her presence. But if she was at the register or elsewhere, maybe not. But I think the key is whether the person was present and in control of the property. If the woman was not present when the defendant took the purse, then it's theft. Similarly, in G, the wallet was on the street, unattended.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C and G, but the options only have one correct. Wait, looking at the options again, the user provided options A to I, but the answer needs to be one letter.

Wait, the user's question lists options A to I, each with a different scenario. So, I need to pick the one where the defendant is NOT guilty of robbery.

Looking again:

Option C: Unattended purse in a cart. So, not from person, theft. So, not robbery. So, the defendant would not be guilty of robbery.

Option G: Found a lost wallet on the street. Took money. Again, not from person, theft. So, not robbery.

So, both C and G are not robbery. But the question is which one is the correct answer. Wait, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, the question is which situation would the defendant be found NOT GUILTY of robbery. So, the correct answer would be either C or G.

But in the options, perhaps the intended answer is C, because in G, the defendant took the wallet, but in C, it's a purse in a shopping cart. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G.

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether the taking was from a store. In C, the defendant was in a grocery store and took the purse from the cart. If the owner was not present, it's theft. In G, the wallet was found on the street, so definitely theft.

But the question is which situation would the defendant not be guilty of robbery. So, both C and G are possible, but perhaps the intended answer is C, as it's in a store, and the purse was in a cart, so perhaps the owner was not present. Alternatively, maybe the answer is G.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the elements again. Robbery requires that the property is taken from the person's immediate presence. So, in C, the purse was in the cart, but if the owner was nearby, maybe it's considered from her presence. But if she wasn't, it's theft.

Wait, the scenario in C says the purse was in the cart, unattended. So, the owner was not present. So, it's theft. Similarly, G is theft.

But the question is which situation would the defendant be found NOT GUILTY of robbery. So, either C or G would be correct. But the options are A to I, so perhaps the intended answer is C.

Wait, but the answer options provided by the user are A to I, and the correct answer is one of them. So, perhaps the intended answer is C or G.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C because it's more clearly not robbery, as the purse was unattended, and the defendant didn't confront anyone. Similarly, G is also not robbery. But the question is which one is the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is G because it's taking from an unattended wallet, which is more straightforwardly theft, not robbery.

Wait, I'm a bit confused, but perhaps the intended answer is C.

Wait, I think I should go with C because it's the more clear case of theft, not robbery. So, the defendant in C would not be guilty of robbery.
</think>

In this scenario, the defendant would most likely be found NOT GUILTY of robbery because the act involved taking an unattended purse from a shopping cart in a grocery store, which constitutes theft rather than robbery. Robbery requires the taking of property directly from a person's immediate presence with force or threat, which is not present here.
