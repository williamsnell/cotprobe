Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read it again: "A liquid element that is a dark-colored, nonconducting substance at room temperature is..." The options are A through J, each a different element. Hmm, I remember that at room temperature, some elements are liquid, others are solid or gas. Let me think about each option.

First, I'll list out the options and what I know about them. Option A is lead. Lead is a heavy metal, and I think it's a solid at room temperature. It's also a good conductor of electricity, but wait, the question says nonconducting. So maybe A is not the answer.

Option B is cesium. Cesium is an alkali metal, right? I think it's a solid at room temp. It's also a good conductor, so probably not the right one.

Option C is bromine. Oh, wait, bromine is one of the elements that is liquid at room temperature. I remember that bromine is a dark red-brown color and has a strong odor. Also, I think it's a nonconductor because it's not a metal. So this sounds promising.

Option D is francium. Francium is a radioactive element, and I don't think it's a liquid at room temp. Plus, it's rare and probably a solid.

Option E is rubidium. Another alkali metal, solid at RT, conductor, so not the answer.

Option F is iodine. Iodine is a solid at room temperature, right? It's a crystalline solid and dark purple in color. But wait, doesn't it sublime into a gas? Still, it's a solid, so not the answer.

Option G is bismuth. Bismuth is a heavy metal, solid at RT, conductor. So no.

Option H is mercury. Oh, mercury is the only liquid metal at room temperature. But wait, the question states it's nonconducting. Mercury is a conductor, so that might not fit. Also, mercury is silver-colored, not dark. So probably not H.

Option I is gallium. Gallium is a solid at RT, I believe. It's used in electronics, so it's a conductor. Not the answer.

Option J is gold. Gold is a solid at RT, conductor, so not the answer.

So going back, the only liquid element at RT among the options is bromine (C) and mercury (H). But mercury is a conductor and silver, so it doesn't fit the dark color and nonconducting. Bromine is liquid, dark-colored, and nonconducting because it's not a metal. So the answer should be C: bromine.

The correct answer is C: bromine. Bromine is a liquid at room temperature, dark-colored, and nonconducting. 

Answer: C
