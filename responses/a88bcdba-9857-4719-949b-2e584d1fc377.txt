Question:

The Experimental Company is now producing and selling 17,000 units of product per year at a sales price of $250 each. It has had a profit objective of 20 percent return on a $2,000,000 investment. Its present cost structure is as follows: Manufacturing costs: Fixed costs $400,000 per year Variable costs $175 per unit produced Selling and administration expenses: Fixed expenses $135,000 per year Variable expenses $25 per unit sold Ten hours are required to produce a unit of product. The company is interested in pushing its rate of operations to 100 percent of its capacity-20,000 units of product. It believes that it can raise its price by up to 5 percent of the present sales price without cutting its present sales volume. In addition, it believes that it can increase its sales to productive capacity with minor design and quality improvements that will increase variable manufacturing costs by $5 per unit, and with accompanying promotion that will increase its variable selling and administration expenses by $5 per unit for all units sold. The company would like to achieve a profit objective of 25 percent on its investment. REQUIRED: 1) Can the company, within the price increase limitation indicated, achieve its new profit objective by reaching full utilization of capacity with the increased variable costs and expenses required? 2) What would the sales price have to be to achieve the new profit objective? 3) What sales price would achieve the old profit objective?

Options:

A: $258.00, $259.50/unit, $253.00/unit
B: $257.50, $258.75/unit, $252.00/unit
C: $269.00, $269.50/unit, $263.00/unit
D: $262.50, $261.75/unit, $255.00/unit
E: $255.50, $262.75/unit, $265.00/unit
F: $267.50, $268.00/unit, $262.50/unit
G: $270.00, $270.50/unit, $265.00/unit
H: $263.50, $264.00/unit, $258.50/unit
I: $265.50, $265.75/unit, $260.00/unit
J: $260.50, $260.75/unit, $250.00/unit

Alright, let's try to work through this problem step by step. It's a bit complicated, but I'll break it down.

First, the company is currently producing and selling 17,000 units at $250 each. They have a profit objective of a 20% return on a $2,000,000 investment. So, their target profit is 20% of $2M, which is $400,000.

But now, they want to increase their profit objective to 25%. So, their new target profit should be 25% of $2M, which is $500,000.

They want to achieve this by reaching full capacity, which is 20,000 units. They can increase their price by up to 5%, so the max new price is 250 * 1.05 = $262.50. But they might not need to go that high.

Also, to increase sales to full capacity, they'll need to make some changes. They'll have minor design and quality improvements which increase variable manufacturing costs by $5 per unit. So, variable manufacturing costs go from $175 to $180 per unit. Additionally, variable selling and admin expenses increase by $5 per unit, so from $25 to $30 per unit.

Let me outline the costs:

Fixed costs:
- Manufacturing: $400,000/year
- Selling and Admin: $135,000/year
Total fixed costs = 400k + 135k = $535,000

Variable costs per unit:
- Manufacturing: $180
- Selling and Admin: $30
Total variable cost per unit = 210

So, total cost per unit is now $210.

Now, they're selling 20,000 units at full capacity. Let's figure out the total costs.

Total variable costs = 20,000 * $210 = $4,200,000
Total fixed costs = $535,000
Total costs = 4,200,000 + 535,000 = $4,735,000

They want a profit of $500,000. So, total revenue needed is 4,735,000 + 500,000 = $5,235,000

Revenue is price per unit * number of units sold. They're selling 20,000 units.

Let me calculate the required price per unit:

Price = 5,235,000 / 20,000 = $261.75

So, the price needs to be $261.75 to achieve the 25% profit. Now, check if this is within the 5% increase limit. The original price is $250, so 5% is $12.50, making the max possible price $262.50. $261.75 is within this limit, so yes, they can achieve the new profit objective.

Now, question 2: what's the required sales price? That's $261.75, which is option J's second value ($260.75 is lower, so no). Wait, let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option J: $260.50, $260.75/unit, $250.00/unit

Wait, that doesn't match. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recalculate.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated total costs. Let me double-check.

Fixed costs: 400k + 135k = 535k.

Variable costs per unit: $180 (manu) + $30 (admin) = $210.

Total variable for 20k units: 20,000 * 210 = 4,200,000.

Total costs: 4,200,000 + 535,000 = 4,735,000.

Desired profit: 500k.

Total revenue needed: 4,735k + 500k = 5,235k.

Price per unit: 5,235,000 / 20,000 = 261.75.

Looking at the options, which one has 261.75 as one of the numbers? Let me check each option.

Option D: 262.50, 261.75, 255.00. Wait, no, D's first is 262.50, second is 261.75. So, yes, the second value is 261.75.

Wait, but in the options, each option has three values, corresponding to the three parts of the question. So, the first value is for part 1 (can they achieve it? If yes, the price would be the answer), but the options are structured as A to J, each with three numbers.

Wait, the options are like:

A: $258.00, $259.50/unit, $253.00/unit

So, the first number is for question 1 (price they can achieve), second for question 2 (required to achieve new profit), third for question 3 (old profit).

Wait, no, the questions are:

1) Can they achieve the new profit objective? If yes, what's the price? But the options seem to list three prices each, probably for each part.

Wait, the questions are three separate ones:

1) Can they achieve the new profit? So, yes or no, but the options give possible prices, so perhaps for the first question, the answer is whether they can, which is yes, and what price would that be.

But the options are giving three prices, perhaps for each of the three questions.

Wait, the options are structured as three prices per option, each corresponding to the three required answers.

So, for each option (A-J), the first number is the answer to question 1, the second to question 2, and the third to question 3.

Wait, the question says:

"REQUIRED: 1) Can the company... 2) What would the sales price have to be to achieve the new profit objective? 3) What sales price would achieve the old profit objective?"

So, the three answers are:

1) Yes or No, but the options don't have yes/no, they have prices. So perhaps the first price in each option is the answer to question 1 (the price they can achieve), the second to question 2 (price needed for new profit), the third to question 3 (price for old profit).

Wait, but the initial part asks if they can achieve it, which is a yes/no, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the first part's answer is embedded in the options' first number.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are structured such that the first number is the answer to question 1 (the new price to achieve the new profit), the second to question 2 (same as question 1?), and the third to question 3 (old price).

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the calculations.

Old profit objective was 20%, which is $400k profit.

At current operations (17k units, $250 each), let's see if they are meeting the old profit.

Current revenue: 17,000 * 250 = $4,250,000.

Current costs:

Fixed manufacturing: $400k

Variable manufacturing: 17k * 175 = 2,975k

Fixed selling/admin: $135k

Variable selling/admin: 17k *25=425k

Total costs: 400k + 2,975k + 135k +425k = 4,000k + 400k? Wait, 400 + 2,975 is 3,375 + 135 is 3,510 + 425 is 3,935k.

Revenue is 4,250k.

Profit: 4,250k - 3,935k = $315,000. But their target was $400k, so they were not meeting it.

But the question is, what would the sales price be to achieve the old profit? So, when they were selling 17k units, what price would they need to set to get $400k profit.

Wait, but perhaps the old profit was based on the initial investment. Alternatively, perhaps the old profit was 20% on $2M, which is $400k, as I thought.

So, to find the required price to achieve the old profit, assuming they don't change anything except price.

But wait, in the current scenario, they are selling 17k units at $250, making a profit of $315k. To reach $400k, they need to either increase volume, change costs, or increase price.

But the third question is: what sales price would achieve the old profit objective? Probably, if they kept the same volume, what price would they need.

So, let's calculate the required price to get $400k profit at 17k units.

First, calculate the total costs at 17k units with the old cost structure.

Fixed costs: 400k + 135k = 535k

Variable manufacturing: 17k *175 = 2,975k

Variable selling/admin: 17k *25 = 425k

Total variable costs: 2,975k +425k=3,400k

Total costs: 535k +3,400k=3,935k

Desired profit: 400k

Total revenue needed: 3,935k +400k=4,335k

Price per unit: 4,335,000 /17,000= 255.

So, the price needs to be $255 to achieve the old profit of $400k at 17k units.

Wait, but in the current setup, they are selling at $250 and making $315k. To make $400k, they could either increase the price, reduce costs, or increase volume. But the question is, what sales price would achieve the old profit objective, assuming they are selling 17k units. So, the required price is $255.

Now, back to the new profit objective. The required price is $261.75, as calculated earlier.

Looking at the options:

Option D: $262.50, $261.75, $255.00. So, first number is 262.50, second 261.75, third 255.

So, the answers would be:

1) The price to achieve the new profit is $261.75.

2) The price needed is also $261.75.

3) The old price is $255.

Looking back, the options are structured as:

Each option has three prices, probably for the three questions. So, the first price in the option would be the answer to question 1 (price to achieve new profit), the second to question 2 (same as question 1 because they need to set that price), and the third to question 3 (old price).

Wait, but question 1 is whether they can achieve the new profit by reaching full capacity with the increased costs and price within the 5% limit. Since the required price is $261.75, which is within the 5% increase (max is $262.50), the answer to question 1 is yes, and the price is $261.75.

Question 2 is what price is needed, which is $261.75.

Question 3 is what price achieves the old profit, which is $255.

Looking at option D: $262.50, $261.75, $255.00.

Wait, but $262.50 is the max allowed price (5% increase), but the required price is $261.75, which is less than 262.50. So, the company can achieve the new profit by setting the price at $261.75, which is within the 5% limit.

So, the answers would be:

1) Yes, they can achieve it by setting the price to $261.75.

2) The required price is $261.75.

3) The old price to achieve the old profit was $255.

Looking at the options, option D has 262.50, 261.75, 255. So, the first number is 262.50, which is the max allowed price, but the actual required is 261.75. So, perhaps the first number in the option is not the answer to question 1, but the answer to question 1 is 'yes' and the price is 261.75, which is the second number in option D.

Wait, perhaps the options are structured as:

Each option lists three prices, each corresponding to the three questions. So, the first price is the answer to question 1 (price to achieve new profit), the second to question 2 (same as question 1?), and the third to question 3 (old price).

But in the calculation, the required price for new profit is 261.75, and the old price is 255. So, looking for an option where the second and third numbers are 261.75 and 255.

Looking at option D: 262.50, 261.75, 255.00.

Yes, that's correct. So, the second number is 261.75 (answer to question 2), third is 255 (answer to question 3). The first number is 262.50, which is the maximum allowed price. But the required price is 261.75, which is within the limit, so the answer to question 1 is yes.

So, the correct option is D, where the second value is 261.75 and third is 255. But wait, the first part of the question is whether they can achieve the new profit, which they can, so the first answer would be yes, but the options don't have yes/no, they have prices. So perhaps the first price in each option is the answer to question 1, indicating the price they would set to achieve the new profit, which must be within the 5% limit.

In that case, the correct price is 261.75, which is option D's second number, but the first number is 262.50. Hmm, perhaps the options list the three answers in the order of 1), 2), 3). So, the first number is the answer to 1), which is the price they need to set to achieve the new profit, which is 261.75, but none of the options have that as the first number. Wait, option D's first number is 262.50, which is the max allowed. But the required is 261.75, which is less than that. So, perhaps the first number is the price they can achieve, which is 261.75, but looking at the options, none have that as the first number. Wait, option J has 260.50 as first, which is lower than 261.75, which is not correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the required price. Let me recheck.

Total required revenue: 5,235,000.

Price = 5,235,000 / 20,000 = 261.75.

Yes, correct.

Looking at the options, the only option where the second number is 261.75 is option D. So, the three answers are:

1) Can they achieve it? Yes, by setting the price at 261.75.

2) The required price is 261.75.

3) The old price is 255.

So, the option that has 261.75 as the second number and 255 as the third is option D.

But looking at the options, option D is:

D: $262.50, $261.75/unit, $255.00/unit

So, the first number is 262.50, which is the maximum allowed price, but the required is 261.75, which is within the limit. So, the company can achieve the new profit by setting the price at 261.75, which is the second number in option D.

Therefore, the answers are:

1) Yes, at $261.75 (but in the options, it's the second number)

2) $261.75

3) $255

So, the correct option is D, where the second and third numbers match.
</think>

The company can achieve its new profit objective by setting the sales price at $261.75 per unit, which is within the allowed 5% price increase. To achieve the old profit objective, the sales price needs to be $255 per unit.

Answer: D
