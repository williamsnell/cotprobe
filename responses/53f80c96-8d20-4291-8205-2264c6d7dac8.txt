Okay, so I have this question about economic growth, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says that real GDP per capita was $10,000 in 1990 and $15,000 in 2000. It's asking for the amount of economic growth. The options are A through J, with various percentages.

I remember that economic growth is usually measured as the percentage increase in real GDP per capita over a period. So, I need to calculate the percentage growth from 1990 to 2000.

First, I'll find the absolute increase. In 1990, it was $10k, and in 2000, it's $15k. So the increase is $15k - $10k = $5k.

Now, to get the percentage growth, I think I divide the increase by the original amount (which is the starting value, so 1990's $10k) and then multiply by 100 to get a percentage.

So that's ($5k / $10k) * 100. Let's do the math: 5 divided by 10 is 0.5, and 0.5 times 100 is 50. So that's 50% growth.

Looking at the options, I see option I is 50 percent. Wait, that's a big jump. But wait, the time period is 10 years, from 1990 to 2000. So the growth rate per year would be different, but the question is just asking for the total growth over the period, not the annual rate. So I think 50% is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check. Sometimes people confuse growth rates with average annual rates. But the question says "the amount of economic growth," which I think refers to the total growth over the period, not the annual rate. So yes, 50% from $10k to $15k is correct.

So the answer should be option I, which is 50 percent.

The economic growth is calculated by finding the percentage increase from $10,000 to $15,000, which is 50%.
