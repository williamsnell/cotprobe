Question:

Genetic variation occurs in bacteria as a result of mutations. This would seem to be the only process giving rise to variation , for bacteria reproduce through binary fission. Design an experiment to support the existence of another process that results in variation.

Options:

A: Artificial genetic modification through genetic engineering techniques
B: Spontaneous mutation
C: Recombination of traits through conjugation
D: Exposure to mutagenic chemicals that induce DNA changes
E: Genetic drift
F: Binary fission

Answer:

Okay, so I've got this question here about genetic variation in bacteria. The question says that genetic variation comes from mutations because bacteria reproduce through binary fission. But the task is to design an experiment that supports another process causing variation besides just mutations. Hmm, I remember that bacteria can have other ways of exchanging genetic material.

Wait, binary fission is their main way of reproducing, which is a form of asexual reproduction. So mutations are the primary source of variation here because each cell just splits and the DNA is copied, but sometimes errors occur. But the question is about another process. I think the other main process is conjugation, which is a form of horizontal gene transfer.

Conjugation involves bacteria connecting via a pilus and transferring plasmids, which can carry genes. So if I design an experiment to show that, I might need to see if bacteria without a certain trait can acquire it through contact with others.

For example, suppose I have two bacterial cultures: one that can break down lactose (lactose+), and another that cannot (lactose-). If I mix them, maybe the lactose- ones will gain the ability if they receive a plasmid with the lactose operon. So I could grow them together and see if the number of lactose+ increases.

Wait, but would that be the right approach? Alternatively, maybe using a tracer, like a antibiotic resistance gene. If the donor bacteria have resistance and the recipients don't, after mixing, if some recipients gain resistance, that would show conjugation.

So the experiment would involve growing donor and recipient bacteria together, then checking for the presence of the transferred trait. If the trait appears in some recipients, it suggests conjugation, hence recombination through this process.

Looking at the options, option C is recombination through conjugation. So the experiment should support that. The other options: A is genetic engineering, which is人为的, not a natural process. B is spontaneous mutation, which is what the question says is already considered. D is mutagenic chemicals, again an external factor, but not another process like conjugation. E is genetic drift, which is random changes in allele frequency, not a process causing new variation. F is binary fission, which is the original method.

So the correct answer should be C.

The experiment involves testing whether bacterial genetic variation can occur through conjugation, a process of horizontal gene transfer. By mixing donor and recipient bacteria, the experiment demonstrates the transfer of genetic material, such as antibiotic resistance, indicating recombination through conjugation.

Answer: C
