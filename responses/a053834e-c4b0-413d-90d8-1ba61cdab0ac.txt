Okay, so I've got this problem about painting a room, and I need to figure out how much the paint will cost. Let me break it down step by step because I'm a bit new to this kind of calculation.

First, the room dimensions are given as 14 feet by 12 feet by 8 and a half feet. Wait, 8(1/2)%'? Hmm, that seems odd. Oh, maybe it's a typo. Probably, the ceiling height is 8.5 feet. Yeah, that makes more sense because 8(1/2)%' sounds like a weird unit. So, I'll assume the room is 14' long, 12' wide, and 8.5' high.

The task is to paint the walls and the ceiling. So, I need to calculate the total area of the walls plus the area of the ceiling.

Let me start with the walls. There are four walls, but opposite walls are the same size. So, two walls are 14' by 8.5', and the other two are 12' by 8.5'. 

For the two longer walls: each is 14' wide and 8.5' high. So, the area for one is 14 * 8.5. Let me calculate that: 14 * 8 is 112, and 14 * 0.5 is 7, so together that's 119 sq ft. Since there are two of these, that's 119 * 2 = 238 sq ft.

For the two shorter walls: each is 12' wide and 8.5' high. So, 12 * 8.5. 12*8 is 96, and 12*0.5 is 6, so 102 sq ft. Two of them would be 102 * 2 = 204 sq ft.

Now, adding both sets of walls: 238 + 204 = 442 sq ft for all the walls.

Next, the ceiling. The ceiling is the same as the floor area, which is length times width. So, 14 * 12 = 168 sq ft.

So the total area to paint is walls plus ceiling: 442 + 168 = 610 sq ft.

Now, the paint options. Paint costs $6.50 per gallon and covers 425 sq ft. Alternatively, it's $1.85 per quart, but I'm not sure if that's the same paint or a different price. Wait, the problem says the paint is $6.50 per gallon (which covers 425 sq ft) OR $1.85 per quart. Hmm, but I'm not sure if the quart is the same as the gallon. Probably, the quart is a smaller quantity. But I need to figure out which option to use.

Wait, maybe the question is giving two pricing options: either buy gallons at $6.50 each, covering 425 sq ft, or buy quarts at $1.85 each. I think I should calculate which is cheaper per quart or per gallon, but maybe it's better to just compute the total gallons needed and then see which option is cheaper.

Alternatively, maybe the question is just about calculating the total gallons needed and then choosing the cost based on the gallon price. Because the quart option might be a distractor. Let me focus on the gallon first.

Total area is 610 sq ft. Each gallon covers 425 sq ft. So, how many gallons do I need? Let me divide 610 by 425.

610 ÷ 425 ≈ 1.433 gallons. Since you can't buy a fraction of a gallon, you'd need to round up to 2 gallons. But wait, maybe the quart is a better option. Let me see.

If each quart is $1.85 and covers, well, I'm not sure how much a quart covers. Wait, a gallon is 4 quarts. So, if a gallon covers 425 sq ft, then each quart would cover 425 /4 = 106.25 sq ft. So each quart covers about 106.25 sq ft.

So, for 610 sq ft, how many quarts would I need? 610 ÷ 106.25 ≈ 5.74 quarts. So, I'd need 6 quarts. At $1.85 per quart, 6 * 1.85 = $11.10. That's more expensive than buying two gallons at $6.50 each, which would be 2 * 6.50 = $13.00. Wait, but wait, maybe I did something wrong here.

Wait, let me check again. If a gallon is 4 quarts, and each gallon covers 425 sq ft, then each quart covers 425 /4 = 106.25 sq ft. So, 610 ÷ 106.25 = 5.74 quarts, so 6 quarts. 6 * 1.85 = 11.10. Alternatively, using gallons: 610 ÷425 ≈ 1.433, so you'd need 2 gallons, costing 2 *6.50 =13.00.

But wait, the options don't have 13.00 as an option. Wait, looking back, option G is $13.00. Hmm, but let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: $7.65

B: $10.20

C: $15.30

D: $26.00

E: $9.75

F: $2.80

G: $13.00

H: $19.50

I: $3.70

J: $6.50

So, 2 gallons at $6.50 each is $13.00, which is option G. But wait, maybe I can buy 1.5 gallons? Wait, no, because you can't buy partial gallons. So, 2 gallons are needed, costing $13.00.

Alternatively, if I use quarts, 6 quarts would cost $11.10, which isn't an option. So, the cheaper option is to buy gallons, which would be $13.00, option G.

Wait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the area. Let me recalculate the walls and ceiling.

Walls:

Two walls of 14x8.5: 2*(14*8.5)=2*(119)=238.

Two walls of 12x8.5: 2*(12*8.5)=2*(102)=204.

Total walls: 238 +204=442.

Ceiling:14*12=168.

Total area:442 +168=610. That seems correct.

So, 610 ÷425=1.433. So, 2 gallons needed. 2*$6.50= $13.00, which is option G.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is $15.30, which is 2.364... Maybe I made a mistake in the area.

Wait, maybe I missed a wall or miscalculated. Let me recalculate the walls.

Each pair of walls:

14x8.5: 14*8.5=119. Two of them: 238.

12x8.5: 12*8.5=102. Two of them: 204.

Total walls: 238+204=442.

Ceiling:14*12=168.

Total:442+168=610.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the ceiling isn't being painted, but the question says walls and ceiling, so I included that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gallons needed. Let me see: 610 ÷425=1.433, so 1.433 gallons needed. So, you can't buy a fraction, so you have to buy 2 gallons, which is 2*$6.50=13.00.

So, the answer should be G: $13.00.
</think>

The room has dimensions 14' × 12' × 8.5'. The walls consist of two pairs: two walls of 14' × 8.5' and two walls of 12' × 8.5'. The ceiling is 14' × 12'. Calculating the areas:

- Walls: 2 × (14 × 8.5) + 2 × (12 × 8.5) = 238 + 204 = 442 sq ft.
- Ceiling: 14 × 12 = 168 sq ft.
- Total area: 442 + 168 = 610 sq ft.

Each gallon of paint covers 425 sq ft, costing $6.50. To cover 610 sq ft, 2 gallons are needed (since 1 gallon covers 425 sq ft and 1.433 gallons are required, rounded up to 2). The cost is 2 × $6.50 = $13.00.
