Question:

In 1996, a developer purchased a 100-acre tract located in a northern county in a state. Shortly thereafter, the developer prepared a subdivision plan that created 100 one-acre residential building lots on this tract. In 1997, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office. During the next few years, the developer sold 60 residential lots to individual purchasers. Each deed specified that every lot designated on the subdivision plan was to be recorded in the county recorder's office. Each deed also provided the following:"No house trailer or mobile home shall be built or maintained on any lot within the subdivision. "In 2003, the developer conveyed the remaining 40 lots to a builder by deed that included language identical to that contained in the first 60 deeds. This deed from the developer to the builder was recorded. By 2008, the builder had sold all of the 40 lots. Each of these deeds identified each lot as being a part of the subdivision, but did not include the clause relating to mobile homes. On January 30, 2009, a buyer, who had purchased one of the residential lots from the builder, placed a mobile home on his property. Which of the following statements is LEAST accurate with respect to the buyer's deed?

Options:

A: The buyer has no obligation to remove the mobile home.
B: All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of contract.
C: The deed from the builder to the buyer did not include the covenant prohibiting mobile homes.
D: The covenant prohibiting mobile homes ran with the land as far as the builder, but not as far as the buyer.
E: All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of estate.
F: The buyer should have had constructive notice of the restriction against mobile homes.
G: The buyer should have had actual notice of the restriction against mobile homes.
H: The covenant prohibiting mobile homes could be enforced by any subdivision lot owner.
I: The covenant prohibiting mobile homes was not recorded with the county recorder's office.
J: The covenant prohibiting mobile homes could only be enforced by the original developer.

Okay, so I've got this property law question here, and I need to figure out the least accurate statement about the buyer's deed. Let me read through the facts again carefully.

In 1996, a developer bought a 100-acre tract and made a subdivision plan with 100 one-acre lots. In 1997, they recorded the plan. Then, they sold 60 lots, each deed saying that each lot was to be recorded. Each of these deeds had a clause prohibiting mobile homes or house trailers. Then, in 2003, the developer sold the remaining 40 lots to a builder with a deed that had the same language as the first 60. That deed was recorded. The builder sold all 40 by 2008, but those deeds didn't include the mobile home clause. In 2009, the buyer, who bought from the builder, placed a mobile home on their lot. 

The question is about the statements regarding the buyer's deed. I need to pick the least accurate one, which is the incorrect statement.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: The buyer has no obligation to remove the mobile home. Hmm. If the covenant is enforceable, then the buyer might be in breach, but whether they have to remove it depends on whether the covenant runs with the land and if it's a restrictive covenant that's enforceable against successors. But if the builder didn't include the covenant in the deed to the buyer, maybe the covenant doesn't bind the buyer. So maybe the buyer can keep the mobile home. So A could be accurate, making it not the least accurate.

Option B: All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of contract. Privity of contract is about being bound by prior agreements. But if the builder didn't include the covenant in their deeds, their grantees wouldn't be in privity of contract with the original developer. They might not be bound by the original covenant unless it's a running covenant. So B might not be correct, but I'm not sure yet.

Option C: The deed from the builder to the buyer didn't include the mobile home clause. Yes, that's stated in the facts. The builder's deeds didn't have the clause, so C is accurate. So it's not the least accurate.

Option D: The covenant ran with the land as far as the builder but not the buyer. So the original developer sold to the builder with the covenant, so the builder is bound. But when the builder sells to the buyer without the covenant, does the covenant run to the buyer? It depends on whether it's a real covenant (runs with the land) or equitable servitudes. For real covenants, they need to touch and concern the land, be in writing, and be recorded. Also, they must run with the land, meaning the burden can run with the land if it's appurtenant (benefit and burden touch the land) and the parties intended it to run. 

The original covenant was in the developer's deed to the builder, so the builder is bound. But if the builder doesn't include it in their deed to the buyer, does the covenant still apply? If it's a real covenant, the burden could run, but the buyer would need notice. Alternatively, if the covenant is a negative easement, it might still apply. But if the builder didn't record it, maybe the buyer didn't have notice. But the original developer's deed to the builder was recorded, so the subdivision plan is part of the public records. So the buyer might have constructive notice.

Wait, the original subdivision plan from 1997 was recorded. The plan likely included the restrictions. So when the builder sold to the buyer, they should have checked the records and would have found the restriction. So the buyer had constructive notice. Therefore, the covenant runs with the land, and the buyer is still bound, even if the builder didn't include it in the deed. So D says it runs as far as the builder but not the buyer, which would be incorrect. So D is least accurate.

Option E: All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of estate. Privity of estate refers to the chain of title. The builder's deed to the buyer would be in privity of estate, but their subsequent grantees would be in privity with the buyer, not the original developer. So E might not be correct, but I'm not sure.

Option F: The buyer should have constructive notice. Since the subdivision plan was recorded in 1997, which includes the restrictions, the buyer, when purchasing in 2008 or 2009, should have checked the records and found the restriction. So F is accurate, making it not the least accurate.

Option G: The buyer should have actual notice. Actual notice would require the buyer to have known about the restriction, but they might not have. However, in real estate, constructive notice from recording is enough, so G is incorrect because the buyer doesn't need actual noticeâ€”constructive suffices. So G is incorrect, making it a possible answer.

Wait, but the original developer's deed to the builder included the covenant, and that deed was recorded. So the subdivision plan, which was recorded, would have the restrictions. So when the builder sold to the buyer, the buyer would be charged with notice of the recorded documents affecting the land. So the buyer should have constructive notice of the restriction, making F correct and G incorrect. So G is least accurate because the buyer didn't need actual notice, only constructive. But wait, the option says G: the buyer should have had actual notice. That's incorrect because actual notice isn't required; constructive is enough. So G is an incorrect statement, making it a candidate for least accurate.

Option H: The covenant could be enforced by any subdivision lot owner. That depends on whether it's an appurtenant covenant. If it's appurtenant, only the benefited property can enforce it. But if the original developer conveyed all the lots, and the covenant runs with the land, then any lot owner could enforce it because they're all subject to the same restrictions. So H could be accurate.

Option I: The covenant was not recorded. Wait, the original developer's deed to the builder included the covenant, and that deed was recorded. So the covenant was recorded. So I is incorrect because the covenant was recorded. So I is an incorrect statement, making it a possible answer.

Option J: The covenant could only be enforced by the original developer. No, because if the covenant runs with the land, any current owner can enforce it. So J is incorrect.

Wait, let me clarify:

- The original developer sold 60 lots with the covenant, each deed recorded. Then, in 2003, the developer sold the remaining 40 to the builder with the same covenant, and that deed was recorded. So the subdivision plan, which was recorded, includes the restrictions. Therefore, the covenant is part of the recorded documents, so it's in the public records.

When the builder sells to the buyer, the buyer is on notice of the restrictions because they would have checked the records. So the covenant is enforceable against the buyer because it's a real covenant that runs with the land, and the buyer had constructive notice.

So looking back at the options:

A: Buyer has no obligation to remove. If the covenant is enforceable, the buyer might have to remove, but if the covenant doesn't apply, they don't. So if the covenant applies, A is incorrect.

B: Subsequent grantees of the builder in privity of contract. Privity of contract requires that they are bound by the original contract. Since the builder didn't include the covenant, their grantees aren't in privity of contract with the original developer. So B is incorrect.

C: Builder's deed didn't include the clause. Correct.

D: Runs as far as builder but not buyer. Incorrect because the covenant likely runs.

E: Grantees in privity of estate. They are in privity with the buyer, so E is correct.

F: Constructive notice. Correct.

G: Actual notice. Incorrect because constructive is enough.

H: Any owner can enforce. Correct if it's a covenant running with the land.

I: Not recorded. Incorrect because it was recorded.

J: Only developer can enforce. Incorrect.

So the least accurate statements are B, D, G, I, J, and possibly A and H.

But let's focus on the options. The question asks for the least accurate statement about the buyer's deed.

Looking at the options:

Option B: All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of contract. Since the builder's deeds didn't include the covenant, their grantees aren't in privity of contract with the original developer. So B is incorrect.

Option D: The covenant ran as far as the builder but not the buyer. But since the covenant was recorded, the buyer is bound, so D is incorrect.

Option I: The covenant was not recorded. But it was recorded in the developer's deed to the builder, so I is incorrect.

Option J: Only the original developer can enforce. No, any current owner can, so J is incorrect.

Option G: Buyer should have actual notice. No, they have constructive notice, so G is incorrect.

So the least accurate statements are B, D, G, I, J.

But the question asks for the least accurate statement regarding the buyer's deed.

Looking back, the buyer's deed from the builder didn't include the covenant. So which options pertain to that?

Option C is correct because the builder's deed didn't include the covenant.

Option D says the covenant ran to the builder but not the buyer. But since the covenant was recorded, it likely runs to the buyer as well. So D is incorrect.

Option F: Correct, buyer has constructive notice.

Option G: Incorrect, as constructive is sufficient.

Option I: Incorrect, covenant was recorded.

So which is the least accurate.

The question is about the buyer's deed. So the options relate to that.

The least accurate would be the statement that is factually incorrect.

Option I says the covenant was not recorded. But it was recorded in the developer's deed to the builder, so the subdivision plan with the covenant was recorded. Therefore, I is incorrect.

But wait, the initial 60 deeds had the covenant and were recorded. The 40 lots were sold to the builder with the same covenant, which was recorded. So the entire subdivision plan, including the covenant, was recorded. Therefore, when the builder sold to the buyer, the buyer had constructive notice. So the covenant was recorded, making I incorrect.

So the least accurate statement is I: The covenant prohibiting mobile homes was not recorded with the county recorder's office. That's incorrect because it was recorded.

Alternatively, looking at option D: The covenant ran as far as the builder but not the buyer. But since the covenant was recorded, it runs to the buyer as well. So D is incorrect.

But the question is about the buyer's deed. So the buyer's deed didn't include the covenant, but the covenant was still enforceable because it was recorded. So the statement that says the covenant didn't run to the buyer is incorrect.

So the least accurate statement would be D: The covenant prohibiting mobile homes ran with the land as far as the builder, but not as far as the buyer. Because the covenant did run to the buyer.

Another angle: For a covenant to run with the land, it must be appurtenant (benefit and burden touch the land), in writing, and recorded. Here, the covenant was in the recorded subdivision plan, so it's enforceable against the buyer. So D is incorrect because it did run to the buyer.

Alternatively, option I is incorrect because the covenant was recorded.

But the question is about the buyer's deed. The buyer's deed didn't include the covenant, but the covenant was still enforceable because it was recorded. So which option is least accurate regarding the buyer's deed.

Looking at the options again:

Option I is about the covenant not being recorded. But it was recorded, so I is incorrect.

Option D says the covenant ran to the builder but not the buyer, but it did run to the buyer because it was recorded.

So the least accurate statements are D and I, but which is more so.

The question is about the buyer's deed, so I is about the covenant not being recorded, which is incorrect because it was. So I is the least accurate.

Wait, but the buyer's deed didn't include the covenant, but the covenant was recorded in the subdivision plan. So the buyer had constructive notice. Therefore, the covenant is enforceable, meaning that the statement D is incorrect because it did run to the buyer.

So, which is the least accurate: D or I.

The options are:

I: The covenant was not recorded. But it was recorded, so I is wrong.

D: The covenant ran to the builder but not the buyer. But since it was recorded, it ran to the buyer, so D is wrong.

So both D and I are incorrect. But the question is about the buyer's deed. The buyer's deed didn't include the covenant, but the covenant was recorded elsewhere.

So the least accurate statement is I: The covenant was not recorded. Because it was recorded, I is incorrect.

Alternatively, J says only the original developer can enforce, but any current owner can, so J is incorrect.

But the question is about the buyer's deed, so the focus is on that deed.

Option C is correct because the builder's deed didn't include it.

Option I is incorrect because the covenant was recorded.

So the least accurate is I.

Wait, but the answer options are A to J, and the correct answer is one of them.

Wait, the initial developer's 40 lots were conveyed to the builder in 2003 with the same covenant, which was recorded. So the subdivision plan, which includes the restrictions, was recorded in 1997. So when the builder sold to the buyer in 2008, the buyer would have found the restriction in the recorded subdivision plan. Therefore, the covenant was recorded, making I incorrect.

So the least accurate statement is I: The covenant prohibiting mobile homes was not recorded with the county recorder's office.

But looking back, the options ask about the buyer's deed. So the buyer's deed didn't have the covenant, but the covenant was recorded elsewhere. So the statement I is about the covenant not being recorded, which is incorrect.

So the least accurate statement is I.
</think>

The question revolves around whether the covenant prohibiting mobile homes was enforceable against the buyer despite not being included in the builder's deed. The covenant was originally recorded in the developer's deed to the builder and included in the subdivision plan, which was recorded in 1997. This recording provides constructive notice to subsequent purchasers, including the buyer. Therefore, the covenant runs with the land and binds the buyer, even though it was not included in the builder's deed.

**Option I** states that the covenant was not recorded, which is incorrect because the subdivision plan, including the covenant, was recorded. This makes **I** the least accurate statement.

**Answer: I**
