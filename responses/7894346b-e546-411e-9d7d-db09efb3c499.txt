Question:

A 32-year-old man and his 29-year-old wife come to the office for evaluation for infertility. The wife's gynecologist has reported that her anatomic and physiologic evaluation disclosed no abnormalities and that assessment of potential male factors is needed. The husband is 188 cm (6 ft 3 in) tall with fair skin and little facial hair. He has mild gynecomastia and small, firm testicles. No sperm are seen on semen analysis. Which of the following tests is most likely to establish the underlying cause of this couple's infertility?

Options:

A: Serum cortisol concentration
B: Serum parathyroid hormone concentration
C: Prostate-specific antigen test
D: Semen fructose concentration
E: Thyroid function test
F: Serum prolactin concentration
G: Serum follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone concentrations
H: Serum estrogen and testosterone concentrations
I: Adrenal function test
J: Karyotype from peripheral leukocytes

Alright, so I've got this question about infertility in a couple. Let me try to think through it step by step. Okay, the husband is 32, his wife is 29, and they're having trouble getting pregnant. The wife's gynecologist didn't find any issues, so now they're looking at possible male factors. 

The husband's physical characteristics: he's tall (6 ft 3 in), fair skin, little facial hair. He has mild gynecomastia, which is when men have enlarged breast tissue. His testicles are small and firm. Oh, and his semen analysis showed no sperm. That's a big red flag because azoospermia (no sperm in semen) can indicate some serious issues.

So, the question is asking which test is most likely to find the underlying cause. Let's look at the options.

Option A: Serum cortisol. Cortisol is related to stress and adrenal function. Not sure how that ties in here unless there's an endocrine issue affecting fertility.

Option B: Parathyroid hormone. That's more about calcium regulation. Probably not directly linked unless there's a parathyroid issue causing other symptoms, but not the first thing I'd think of for infertility.

Option C: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA). PSA is usually tested for prostate cancer or other prostate issues. But if there's no sperm, maybe it's about testicular function or obstruction. Not sure if this is the most direct test.

Option D: Semen fructose concentration. Fructose is present in semen from the seminal vesicles. If fructose is low, it might indicate a problem with the seminal vesicles, like blockage. But since there's no sperm at all, maybe it's more about the testes producing sperm, not the transport.

Option E: Thyroid function. Hypothyroidism can cause various issues, including infertility. But again, not the first thing I'd think unless there are other symptoms like fatigue or weight changes.

Option F: Serum prolactin. Prolactin is a hormone that can affect testosterone levels and sperm production. High prolactin can cause low testosterone and infertility. Also, gynecomastia could be a sign of high prolactin. Oh, that's interesting because he does have mild gynecomastia, which can be a symptom of hyperprolactinemia.

Option G: FSH and LH. These are pituitary hormones that regulate the gonads. FSH and LH levels can indicate if the testes are functioning properly. If FSH is high, it might suggest testicular failure because the pituitary increases FSH in response to low testosterone. LH is also related to testosterone production. So testing these could show if there's a problem with the testes.

Option H: Estrogen and testosterone. Testosterone is crucial for sperm production. Estrogen in men is less discussed, but some conditions can cause elevated estrogen. Testing both could be useful, but maybe not the first step if other tests are more indicative.

Option I: Adrenal function. Like cortisol, this relates to the adrenal glands. If there's an issue like Cushing's or Addison's, it could affect fertility, but again, not the most direct unless there are other symptoms.

Option J: Karyotype. A karyotype looks for chromosomal abnormalities, like Klinefelter's syndrome, which can cause infertility. But it's a more involved test and might not be the first line unless other tests point towards genetic issues.

Putting this together: The husband has no sperm in his semen, which could be due to either testicular failure (not producing sperm) or a blockage (obstructive azoospermia). He also has gynecomastia, which points towards a possible endocrine issue. High prolactin can cause this, as it can interfere with testosterone production.

Testing FSH and LH (Option G) would help determine if the testes are the issue. If FSH is elevated, it suggests the testes aren't producing enough, possibly due to damage or genetic issues. If LH is low, it might indicate a problem with the pituitary or hypothalamus. Alternatively, testing prolactin (Option F) could directly address the gynecomastia and its possible link to infertility.

But wait, if the testes are producing no sperm, then serum FSH and LH would likely show high FSH (since the body is trying to stimulate the testes) and normal or low LH. Alternatively, if there's a pituitary issue, both might be low.

Hmm, but the presence of gynecomastia and the possibility of a hormonal imbalance like hyperprolactinemia makes me think that Option F (serum prolactin) is a good candidate. If prolactin is high, it could explain the gynecomastia and might be contributing to low testosterone and thus low sperm production.

Alternatively, if the issue is testicular failure, then FSH and LH would be more informative. But given that the physical exam points towards a possible endocrine issue (gynecomastia), maybe starting with testing hormones like prolactin is better.

Wait, but the question states that the husband has small, firm testicles. That could suggest something like testicular atrophy, which is often seen in conditions like Klinefelter's or after chemotherapy, but it's also seen in cases of primary testicular failure. So maybe FSH and LH would be more indicative of that, as they reflect the testicular function.

I'm a bit torn between Options F and G. If I test FSH and LH, elevated FSH would suggest the testes aren't working, which could be due to genetic issues like Klinefelter's or other causes. If FSH is low, maybe the issue is upstream, like with the pituitary.

But considering the gynecomastia, which is more directly linked to hormonal issues like high prolactin, perhaps testing F first makes sense. High prolactin can suppress gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GNRH), leading to low FSH and LH, which in turn cause low testosterone and gynecomastia.

Wait, but if FSH and LH are low, that would point towards a hypothalamic or pituitary issue. If they're normal or elevated, it's more about testicular function.

So, given that the husband has no sperm, small testicles, and gynecomastia, possible causes include:

1. Obstructive azoospermia (blockage): In this case, FSH and LH would be normal because the testes are producing sperm but can't release them. Semen fructose (Option D) would be normal because the seminal vesicles are still functioning.

2. Testicular failure: Here, FSH and LH would be elevated because the pituitary is trying to stimulate the testes, which aren't responding. Prolactin might be normal in this case.

3. Hormonal imbalance (like hyperprolactinemia): This can cause low testosterone, gynecomastia, and possibly affect sperm production.

So, if the issue is testicular failure, then FSH and LH would be high, and that's what Option G is about. If it's a hormonal imbalance, like high prolactin, then Option F would be better.

But the presence of small, firm testicles makes me think more of testicular failure, perhaps due to genetic reasons. Karyotype (Option J) could detect something like Klinefelter's (47,XXY), which causes small testes and infertility. But that's a more involved test.

Alternatively, if the testes are small and firm, it could also be due to mumps orchitis or other infections causing testicular damage, leading to failure.

So, FSH and LH would help differentiate between testicular failure and other issues. If FSH is high, it points to testicular failure. If it's low, it might indicate a problem with the pituitary or hypothalamus.

Wait, but if the pituitary is the issue, like a tumor or something causing low FSH and LH, that could also lead to low testosterone and gynecomastia. So, testing FSH and LH (Option G) would help determine if the problem is in the testes or the pituitary.

But considering the gynecomastia, which is a sign of high estrogen or low testosterone, maybe testing both FSH, LH, and prolactin would be ideal. But since the options are singular, I have to choose the best one.

The wife's evaluation didn't find issues, so the focus is on the husband. The key here is that he has no sperm, which could be due to either not producing any (testicular failure) or having a blockage (obstructive). Testing FSH and LH would help determine if it's testicular failure. If FSH is high, that suggests the testes aren't working, which could be due to genetic issues, prior damage, etc.

Alternatively, if FSH is low, it's more likely a problem with the pituitary or hypothalamus. But the gynecomastia is making me think about hormonal issues, like hyperprolactinemia, which can cause gynecomastia and impede sperm production.

So, perhaps the best initial tests would be FSH, LH, and prolactin. But since I have to choose one, I need to prioritize.

If the testes are small and firm, and there's no sperm, it's more likely testicular failure. So testing FSH and LH would be more informative in that case. But if it's a hormonal problem, like high prolactin, then that's another angle.

Wait, but the husband's testicles are small and firm, which can be a result of either testicular failure (like in Klinefelter's or after chemotherapy) or from endocrine issues. So, if I test FSH and LH, elevated levels would confirm testicular failure, which would be the cause.

Alternatively, if FSH and LH are normal, then it's more likely an obstruction or something else.

But given that the question is about the underlying cause, and the husband has no sperm, the most likely cause is either testicular failure or obstruction.

Testing FSH and LH (Option G) would help determine which. If FSH is high, it's testicular failure. If it's normal, maybe it's obstruction.

So, the correct answer would be G: Serum FSH and LH concentrations.
</think>

The husband, who is 32 years old, presents with azoospermia (no sperm in semen), mild gynecomastia, and small, firm testicles. These findings suggest possible testicular failure or an endocrine issue. Testing serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations is crucial because elevated FSH typically indicates testicular failure, while normal or low levels may suggest a hypothalamic or pituitary issue. This approach directly addresses the likely cause of his infertility.
