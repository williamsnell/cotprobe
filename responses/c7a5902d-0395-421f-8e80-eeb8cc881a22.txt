Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Oh, shame on you, poor Winter King!
What's this that you have done?
Is 't not a very naughty thing
To snatch the kaiser's crown?
Now you will have to stay away
Alike from Rhine and Prague,
And more than that-shame and dismay
Your days and nights will plague.
Right well you knew, and all the world,
Right well they know this thing,
That Ferdinand alone can be
Bohemia's lawful king.
So come, dear Fritz, rouse up and go
To Ferdinand, your king,
And beg him graciously to show
Full pardon for your sin.

Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question based on the provided song lyrics. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the song is titled "Poor Winter King," and it's from the 17th century. The question is asking what the Winter King did according to the song. The options are A through I, so I'll need to analyze the lyrics to find clues.

Looking at the lyrics:

- The first lines talk about the Winter King doing a "naughty thing" by snatching the kaiser's crown. So, "snatch the kaiser's crown" seems like a key phrase. That might mean he took something that wasn't his, perhaps the crown of the kaiser, which could imply he took over a position or territory.

- The next part says he'll have to stay away from Rhine and Prague, and face shame and dismay. So, maybe he was exiled or forced to leave these places. This suggests he did something wrong and is being punished.

- The lines mention that Ferdinand alone can be Bohemia's lawful king. Ferdinand is likely the rightful ruler, so the Winter King's actions were against Ferdinand's claim.

- The song then tells the Winter King to go to Ferdinand and beg for pardon. So, the Winter King must have done something wrong that required him to seek forgiveness.

Putting this together, the Winter King took the kaiser's crown, which probably means he tried to seize power or territories that belonged to the kaiser, possibly Ferdinand. The song implies he did something wrong, like stealing the crown, which led to him needing to apologize to Ferdinand.

Looking at the options:

A: Claimed lands for the Catholic Church – The song doesn't mention anything about the Church, so probably not.

B: Allied with Ferdinand – The song says the Winter King should go to Ferdinand and beg, which suggests he was against Ferdinand, not allied.

C: Stole the crown from the kaiser – The first line says "snatch the kaiser's crown," so this seems likely.

D: Granted full pardon – The song says he needs to beg for pardon, so he didn't get it yet, so probably not.

E: Symbolic figure without power – The song talks about real actions (snatching a crown), so he had real power.

F: Folk hero – The song is about him being poor and wronged, not a celebrated hero.

G: Defended land from Holy Roman Empire – No mention of defense, more about taking the crown.

H: Rebelled against Ferdinand – The song says he needs to beg, so maybe he rebelled but was wrong.

I: Gave over crown – The song says he needs to give it back, but the action described is him taking it, so perhaps he stole it.

Wait, the question is what the Winter King did. The song says he "snatched the kaiser's crown," which is option C. But another angle is that the kaiser might be Ferdinand, as the song later mentions Ferdinand as the lawful king. So, perhaps the Winter King took Ferdinand's crown, making him the ruler, but Ferdinand is the rightful king. So the Winter King's action was snatching the crown, which is option C.

Alternatively, maybe the Winter King was supposed to give back the crown, which would be option I. But the lyrics say he "snatched" it, so he took it, not gave it. So the action he did was stealing the crown, so option C.

The song describes the Winter King as snatching the kaiser's crown, which indicates he took it unlawfully. The lyrics suggest he needs to seek pardon, implying his action was wrongful. Therefore, the Winter King snatched the crown from the kaiser.

Answer: C
