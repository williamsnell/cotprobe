Okay, so I've got this question about bonds and their valuation. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll do my best.

The question says the security has a maturity value of $100,000, a coupon rate of 5%, and it's due next year. The yield is 9%. I need to figure out how much I should be willing to pay for it now.

Wait, so let me break this down. The maturity value is the amount you get back when the bond matures, which is next year in this case. The coupon rate is 5%, so that's the annual interest paid on the bond. But since it's due next year, the coupon payment would be 5% of $100,000, which is $5,000, right?

But wait, the yield is 9%, which is the current yield or the market rate. So I think I need to calculate the present value of the bond considering the yield. Because the yield is higher than the coupon rate, the bond should be selling at a discount, meaning less than its face value. So the price should be less than $100,000.

How do I calculate this? I remember that the price of a bond is the present value of all its future cash flows. In this case, since it's due next year, there's only one coupon payment and the maturity value. So it's like two cash flows: the coupon payment next year and the principal payment.

Wait no, actually, if it's due next year, maybe the coupon is paid at maturity. Or perhaps it's a zero-coupon bond? Hmm, no, the coupon rate is 5%, so it probably pays interest annually. But since it's due next year, maybe the coupon is paid at the same time as the principal. So maybe there's just one total payment next year, which includes the principal plus the coupon.

Wait, no, that's not right. Typically, coupon payments are periodic. So if it's a one-year bond, the coupon would be paid at the end of the year along with the principal. So the total cash flow at maturity is $100,000 plus the coupon interest of 5% of $100,000, which is $5,000. So total cash flow is $105,000 next year.

But wait, that would make sense if the coupon is paid at maturity. Alternatively, if the coupon is paid semi-annually, but since it's a one-year maturity, maybe it's only paid once. But I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me clarify: the bond has a face value of $100,000, pays a 5% coupon, and matures in one year. The yield is 9%, so I need to discount the cash flows at 9%.

So the total amount received next year is $105,000. To find the present value, I discount that at 9% for one year.

The formula for present value is Cash Flow / (1 + r)^n, where r is the yield and n is the number of periods. Here, n=1, so it's just 1 + 0.09 = 1.09.

So present value = 105,000 / 1.09.

Let me calculate that. 105,000 divided by 1.09 equals... Hmm, 105,000 ÷ 1.09. Let me do that step by step.

Well, 1.09 times 96,330 is approximately 105,000. Because 96,330 * 1.09 = let's see: 96,330 * 1 = 96,330, 96,330 * 0.09 is 8,669.7. Adding them together gives 96,330 + 8,669.7 = 105, so that's correct. So 105,000 / 1.09 ≈ 96,330.28.

Looking back at the options, option B is $96,330.28. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to think about it: if the yield is higher than the coupon rate, the bond is sold at a discount. Since 9% is higher than 5%, the price should be less than $100,000. The total cash flow is $105,000, and discounting that gives around $96,330, which is less than $100k. That makes sense.

Alternatively, if the coupon was paid separately before maturity, but in this case, since it's due next year, I think the coupon is paid at maturity, so it's just the $105,000 total. So yes, the present value is about $96,330.28, which is option B.

The correct answer is option B: $96,330.28.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Cash Flows:**
   - The bond has a face value of $100,000 and a coupon rate of 5%, so the annual coupon payment is $5,000.
   - Since the bond matures next year, the total cash flow at maturity is the face value plus the coupon payment: $100,000 + $5,000 = $105,000.

2. **Determine the Discount Rate:**
   - The yield (or market rate) is 9%, which is used to discount the future cash flows to their present value.

3. **Calculate Present Value:**
   - Use the present value formula: \( \text{PV} = \frac{\text{Cash Flow}}{(1 + r)^n} \)
   - Here, Cash Flow = $105,000, \( r = 0.09 \), and \( n = 1 \).
   - \( \text{PV} = \frac{105,000}{1.09} \approx 96,330.28 \).

4. **Select the Correct Option:**
   - The calculated present value matches option B: $96,330.28.

**Answer:** B
