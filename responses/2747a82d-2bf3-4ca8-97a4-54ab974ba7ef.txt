Okay, so I've got this question about banking reserves, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking.

The question says that a bank has $250,000 in deposits and $10,000 in excess reserves. The required reserve ratio is 20%. They're asking for the bank's actual reserves.

Hmm, I remember that banks are required to keep a certain percentage of their deposits as reserves, which is the required reserve ratio. The actual reserves would be the total reserves they have, which includes both the required reserves and any excess reserves they choose to hold.

So, let me break it down. First, I need to calculate the required reserves. The required reserve ratio is 20%, so I take 20% of the total deposits. The deposits are $250,000, right?

Calculating that: 20% of 250,000 is 0.20 * 250,000. Let's do the math. 0.2 times 250,000 equals 50,000. So the required reserves are $50,000.

Now, the bank has excess reserves of $10,000. Excess reserves are the amount that the bank holds beyond what is required by the reserve ratio. So to find the actual reserves, I add the required reserves and the excess reserves together.

So, actual reserves = required reserves + excess reserves. That would be $50,000 + $10,000, which equals $60,000.

Looking at the options, option H is $60,000. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't mix anything up. Sometimes, I might confuse excess reserves with total reserves, but in this case, the question is clear. The actual reserves are the sum of both required and excess. Yep, that's right. So H is the correct choice.

The bank's actual reserves are calculated by adding the required reserves and excess reserves. The required reserves are 20% of $250,000, which is $50,000. Adding the excess reserves of $10,000 gives a total of $60,000.

Answer: H
