Alright, so I have this question about inflation and purchasing power. I'm a bit rusty on economics, but let me try to think it through. 

Okay, inflation is when the general price level of goods and services rises over time. That means each dollar you have doesn't buy as much as it used to. So, if the price of things goes up, the same amount of money buys fewer things. That should affect purchasing power.

Purchasing power is how much you can buy with your money. If inflation happens, each dollar's value decreases. So, with the same amount, you can buy less. That means purchasing power goes down. 

Looking at the options, A says purchasing power increases, which doesn't make sense because inflation makes things more expensive. B says it remains the same, but that's not true because inflation changes the value. C says it decreases, which aligns with what I was thinking. D says it fluctuates, but the question is about what happens during inflation, not fluctuations.

So the correct answer should be C. Purchasing power decreases, so you buy less with the same money.

The purchasing power of money decreases during inflation, meaning you can buy less with the same amount. 

Answer: C
