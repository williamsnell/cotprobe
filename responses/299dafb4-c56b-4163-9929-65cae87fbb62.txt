Okay, so I have this problem about a bevel gear keyed to a steel shaft using a steel feather key. The torque delivered is 7500 in.-lb, and the shaft has a 2-inch diameter. I need to compute the key length for two different scenarios (a and b) where the key's thickness and width are swapped. The permissible stresses are given: 16,500 psi in compression and tension, and 8,500 psi in shear.

First, I remember that in key connections, the key is subjected to shear and compression/tension stresses. The torque transmitted by the key will depend on the forces acting on it. Since it's a steel key and shaft, the material's yield strengths come into play.

The formula for torque transmitted by a key is typically T = F * d, where F is the force applied and d is the distance over which it's applied. But wait, in this case, the key is in a keyway, so I think the shear and compressive stresses are more relevant.

I think I should consider both shear and compression stresses. The maximum shear stress in the key and the maximum compressive and tensile stresses in the key from the contact with the shaft and gear.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the force exerted by the torque on the key. The torque equation for a key is T = F * L, where L is the length of the key in contact with the shaft. But I'm not sure if L is the length of the key or the effective contact length. Maybe it's better to think in terms of stress.

2. For the key in shear, the shear stress (τ) is equal to the torque (T) divided by the shear area. The shear area for a key is the width of the key (w) times the thickness (t), but wait, the shear occurs across the width and along the length. So, shear stress τ_shear = T / (w * L), where L is the key length.

3. For the compressive and tensile stresses, those are normal stresses. The compressive stress (σ_comp) would be the force per unit area. The force F can be found from the torque: F = T / L. Then, σ_comp = F / (t * L), since the area is thickness (t) times length (L). Similarly, the tensile stress would be the same, but since it's tension, we need to consider that the key might be in tension over half the length or something, but I'm not certain. Maybe it's better to calculate the maximum stress in both shear and normal directions and ensure neither exceeds their permissible limits.

Wait, another approach: the maximum shear stress in the key due to torsion can be calculated, and the maximum normal stress due to bending (from the forces transmitted).

I think the key is subjected to both shear and bending stresses. So, the maximum shear stress and the maximum normal stress (either tension or compression) must both be below their respective permissible limits.

Let me get the formulas straight.

Shear stress in the key: τ = T / (w * L)

Normal stress in the key: σ = (T / L) / (0.5 * t), but wait, I'm not sure. Maybe the normal stress is due to the force transmitted over the key's cross-sectional area. Let me think again.

The torque T is transmitted by the key as a cantilever beam. The shear force at the root of the key (where it meets the shaft) would be F = T / L. This shear force would cause both shear and normal stresses in the key.

Wait, no. The shear stress in the key arises from the shear force F = T / L. The shear area is the width (w) times the length (L), so τ_shear = F / (w * L) = (T / L) / (w * L) ) = T / (w * L²).

Wait, that doesn't seem right because the units might not match. Alternatively, perhaps the shear stress is T divided by the shear area. The shear area for a key in a rectangular keyway is the width (w) times the length (L), so shear stress τ = T / (w * L).

Similarly, the normal stress (σ) would come from the bending moment. The bending moment at the root of the key is M = F * (L/2) = (T / L) * (L/2) ) = T/2.

The maximum bending stress σ is M / (I), where I is the moment of inertia of the key's cross-section. The key is a rectangle, so I = (t^3 * w) / 12. But since the bending is around the thickness, I think the moment would be M = F * (L/2), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the maximum shear stress and the maximum normal stress and ensure both are within their limits.

So, for each case (a and b):

Case (a): key thickness t = 1/2 in, width w = 3/4 in.

Case (b): key thickness t = 3/4 in, width w = 1/2 in.

For each case, we need to find the key length L such that both shear stress τ and normal stress σ are ≤ their permissible limits.

Let me start with case (a).

Case (a): t = 0.5 in, w = 0.75 in.

Shear stress τ = T / (w * L) = 7500 / (0.75 * L) = 7500 / (0.75 L) = 10,000 / L psi.

This τ must be ≤ 8500 psi.

So, 10,000 / L ≤ 8500 → L ≥ 10,000 / 8500 ≈ 1.176 in.

Now for the normal stress σ.

The normal stress comes from the bending moment. The maximum bending moment M_max in the key would be due to the shear force F = T / L. Since the key is in a keyway, the shear force F is applied at the end, leading to a bending moment at the base. Wait, perhaps the bending moment is F * (L/2), assuming the key is a simply supported beam with F at the center? No, maybe it's a cantilever beam, so the bending moment at the fixed end (shaft) would be F * L.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think differently. The key is subjected to a torque T, which causes a shear force F = T / L. This shear force will cause a bending moment in the key.

Assuming the key is a rectangle, the maximum bending stress occurs at the farthest point from the neutral axis. For a rectangular cross-section, the maximum normal stress due to bending is σ = (M * y) / I, where y is the distance from the neutral axis to the farthest fiber, and I is the moment of inertia.

The moment M can be calculated as F * (L/2), where F is the shear force and L/2 is the distance from the center to the end. So M = (T/L) * (L/2) ) = T/2.

Wait, that simplifies to M = 7500 / 2 = 3750 in.-lb.

Now, the moment of inertia I for a rectangular cross-section (width w, thickness t) about its neutral axis is I = (w * t^3)/12.

The maximum distance y from the neutral axis is t/2 (since the key is in tension on one side and compression on the other, so y = t/2).

So, σ = (M * y) / I.

Substituting:

σ = (3750 * (t/2)) / ( (w * t^3)/12 )

Simplify:

σ = (3750 * t/2 ) * (12) / (w t^3 )

= (3750 * 12 ) * t / (2 w t^3 )

= (3750 * 6) / (w t^2 )

= 22500 / (w t^2 )

Now, for case (a), w=0.75 in, t=0.5 in.

σ = 22500 / (0.75 * (0.5)^2 )

Calculate denominator: 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875

σ = 22500 / 0.1875 = 120,000 psi.

Wait, that's way higher than the permissible 16,500 psi for compression and tension. So, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the bending moment calculation. Let me re-examine that.

The shear force F is T / L, which is 7500 / L.

The bending moment at the root of the key (where it meets the shaft) would be F * L, because the shear force is applied at a distance L from the fixed point. So M = F * L = (7500/L) * L = 7500 in.-lb.

Wait, that makes more sense. So M = 7500 in.-lb.

Now, substituting into σ:

σ = (M * y) / I = (7500 * (t/2)) / ( (w t^3)/12 )

Simplify:

= (7500 * t/2 ) * 12 / (w t^3 )

= (7500 * 6 ) / (w t^2 )

= 45000 / (w t^2 )

Now, for case (a), w=0.75 in, t=0.5 in.

σ = 45000 / (0.75 * 0.25) = 45000 / (0.1875) = 240,000 psi. That's way too high, which can't be correct because the allowable is 16,500 psi.

Hmm, that suggests I'm making a mistake in the approach. Maybe I should consider that the normal stress is due to the shear force and the length of the key, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps the normal stress is calculated differently. Let me look for another approach.

Another way: The key is in double shear if it's a square key, but in this case, it's a feather key, which is a rectangular key. The shear force is transmitted over the width and thickness.

Wait, perhaps the normal stress is calculated as the force per unit area in the direction perpendicular to the shear. The shear force F is T / L, and the area over which it's applied is t * L (since the key's cross-section is t in thickness and L in length). So, σ_normal = F / (t * L) = (T / L) / (t * L) ) = T / (t L²).

Wait, that seems more plausible.

So for case (a), σ_normal = 7500 / (0.5 * L² ) = 15000 / L² psi.

This must be ≤ 16,500 psi.

So,

15000 / L² ≤ 16500 → L² ≥ 15000 / 16500 = 0.9091 → L ≥ sqrt(0.9091) ≈ 0.953 in.

Wait, but that would mean the length can be as short as ~0.95 inches, but that's conflicting with the shear stress calculation earlier.

Wait, but earlier, the shear stress was giving L ≥ ~1.176 inches, and the normal stress is giving L ≥ ~0.953 inches. So the more restrictive condition is L ≥ ~1.176 inches.

But that seems too short for a key length, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the normal stress is F divided by the area perpendicular to the force, which is t * L. So F = T / L, so σ = F / (t * L) )= T / (t L² )

So for case (a):

σ = 7500 / (0.5 * L² ) = 15000 / L² ≤ 16500

So 15000 / L² ≤ 16500 → L² ≥ 15000 / 16500 = 0.9091 → L ≥ sqrt(0.9091) ≈ 0.953 in.

But that can't be right because the key length can't be that short. Maybe I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to consider the maximum tensile and compressive stresses in the key. The maximum stress occurs at the edges of the key where the width meets the shaft. The stress can be calculated as σ = (T / L) / (t/2) ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for the normal stress is σ = (T / (L * t/2)). Wait, let's think differently.

The torque T is transmitted by the shear force F = T / L. This shear force causes a bending moment in the key. The bending moment is M = F * a, where a is the distance from the point of application to the support (shaft). Assuming the key is a cantilever, a would be L/2, so M = F * (L/2) ) = (T/L) * (L/2) ) = T/2.

The maximum normal stress due to bending is then σ = (M * y) / I, where y is the distance from the neutral axis to the farthest point, and I is the moment of inertia.

For a rectangular key with width w and thickness t, the moment of inertia I about its neutral axis is I = (w * t^3) / 12.

The maximum distance y is t/2, since the key is in tension on one side and compression on the other.

So σ = (M * (t/2)) / I = (M * t/2) / (w t^3 /12 ) = (M * 6) / (w t^2 )

Now, M = T/2 = 7500 / 2 = 3750 in.-lb.

So σ = (3750 * 6 ) / (w t^2 ) = 22500 / (w t² )

Now, for case (a), w=0.75 in, t=0.5 in.

σ = 22500 / (0.75 * 0.25 ) = 22500 / (0.1875 ) = 120,000 psi.

That's way above the permissible 16,500 psi. So that can't be right. There must be a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should instead consider that the normal stress is calculated based on the shear force and the length. Let me try another approach.

The shear force F = T / L = 7500 / L.

The normal stress σ in the key would be F divided by the area over which it's applied. The area is the width (w) times the thickness (t), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the normal stress is F / (w * t ). So σ = (7500 / L ) / (w * t ) = 7500 / (w t L )

Wait, but that doesn't seem to make sense dimensionally because shear stress was earlier calculated as T/(w L ), which is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the normal stress is F / (t * L ), since the area would be the thickness times the length.

So σ = F / (t * L ) = (7500 / L ) / (t * L ) = 7500 / (t L² )

For case (a), t = 0.5 in.

σ = 7500 / (0.5 * L² ) = 15000 / L².

This must be ≤16500 psi.

So,

15000 / L² ≤ 16500 → L² ≥ 15000 / 16500 ≈ 0.9091 → L ≥ sqrt(0.9091) ≈ 0.953 in.

But that's a very short key, which doesn't make sense. I must be missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the normal stress is calculated based on the cross-sectional area perpendicular to the direction of the force. The shear force is acting along the width, so the normal stress would be in the thickness direction.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is σ = (T / L ) / (t * L ), which is T / (t L² )

So for case (a), that's 7500 / (0.5 L² ) = 15000 / L² ≤ 16500 → L² ≥ 15000 / 16500 ≈ 0.9091 → L ≥ 0.953 in.

But again, that seems too short. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the key's width is the length along the shaft, so the shear area is width (w) times key length (L). So shear stress τ = T/(w L )

Which for case (a), τ = 7500 / (0.75 * L ) = 10000 / L.

This must be ≤8500 → L ≥ 10000 /8500 ≈1.176 in.

Now, for the normal stress, perhaps it's better to consider the maximum stress due to the shear force F = T / L.

The normal stress in the key would be F divided by the area that resists the tension or compression. Since the key is in tension along its length, perhaps the area is the width (w) times thickness (t), so σ = F / (w t )

So σ = (7500 / L ) / (0.75 * 0.5 ) = (7500 / L ) / 0.375 = 20000 / L psi.

This must be ≤16500 psi.

So,

20000 / L ≤16500 → L ≥20000 /16500 ≈1.212 in.

So combining both shear and normal stress constraints:

From shear: L ≥1.176 in.

From normal stress: L ≥1.212 in.

The more restrictive is L ≥1.212 in.

But that's for case (a). Now, looking at the options, the options for (a) are:

A: 1.5, B:2.25, C:1.75, D:2.0, E:2.5, F:1.0, G:3.5, H:2.75, I:3.25, J:3.0.

So 1.212 in is closest to 1.5 in (option A for (a)) or perhaps 1.75 in (option C). Wait, but maybe I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider both shear and normal stresses and find the length that satisfies both.

Shear stress: τ = 10000 / L ≤8500 → L ≥10000/8500≈1.176.

Normal stress: σ =20000 / L ≤16500 → L≥20000/16500≈1.212.

Thus, L must be at least 1.212 in. Looking at the options, the first possible is option A: (a) 1.5 in.

But let's check if that's the case.

Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to calculate the maximum allowable torque based on the key's shear and normal stresses and then solve for L.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula that combines both shear and bending stresses, considering both the shear and normal stress limits.

The maximum shear stress τ = T/(w L ) ≤8500.

And the maximum normal stress σ = (T/(L)) / (t w ) ) = T/(t w L ) ≤16500.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum normal stress is due to the shear force and is calculated as F/(t L ), where F= T/L.

So σ = (T/L)/(t L )= T/(t L² )

So for case (a), σ =7500/(0.5 L² )=15000/L² ≤16500 → L² ≥15000/16500=0.9091→ L≥~0.953.

But shear stress requires L≥1.176, so the limiting factor is shear.

Thus, L must be at least 1.176 in. But none of the options for (a) is exactly that, but the closest higher value is 1.5 in (option A's (a)).

Wait, but let's check for case (a):

If L=1.5 in,

Shear stress τ=7500/(0.75*1.5)=7500/(1.125)=6666.67 psi, which is below 8500.

Normal stress σ=7500/(0.5*(1.5)^2 )=7500/(0.5*2.25)=7500/1.125=6666.67 psi, which is below 16500.

So both stresses are within limits, so L=1.5 in is acceptable.

But wait, in the initial calculation, when I considered the normal stress as F/(w t ), I got σ=20000/L. For L=1.5, that would be 20000/1.5≈13333 psi, which is still under 16500.

So (a) would have L=1.5 in.

Now, for case (b): thickness t=0.75 in, width w=0.5 in.

Shear stress τ=7500/(0.5 * L )=15000/L ≤8500 → L≥15000/8500≈1.7647 in.

Normal stress σ=7500/(0.75 * L² )=10000/(L² ) ≤16500 → L²≥10000/16500≈0.606 → L≥~0.778 in.

So the limiting factor is shear stress, requiring L≥1.7647 in.

Looking at the options, for case (b), the possible lengths are:

Option A: (b) 1.5 in → 1.5<1.7647→ not enough.

Option B: (b)1.25 → no.

Option C: (b)2.25 → yes.

Option D: (b)1.75 → 1.75>1.7647? 1.75 is less than 1.7647, so no.

Wait, 1.75 is 1.75, which is 0.0147 less than 1.7647. So it's insufficient. So the next higher option is 2.25 in (option C's (b)).

Wait, but 2.25 in would give:

Shear stress τ=7500/(0.5*2.25)=7500/(1.125)=6666.67 psi, which is well below 8500.

Normal stress σ=7500/(0.75*(2.25)^2 )=7500/(0.75*5.0625)=7500/(3.7969)=1975.7 psi, which is way below 16500.

So if the permissible shear stress is 8500 psi, then L=1.7647 in is the minimum. Looking at the options, the only option where (b) is ≥1.7647 is option C: (b)2.25 in.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the approach. Let me check.

Wait, for case (b):

Shear stress τ=7500/(w L )=7500/(0.5 * L )=15000/L ≤8500 → L≥15000/8500≈1.7647 in.

So the minimum L is ~1.7647 in. Looking at the options:

Option C's (b) is 2.25 in, which is higher than 1.7647, so acceptable.

But let me check if any option has (b) between 1.7647 and 2.25. Looking at the options:

Option H: (b)1.75 in → 1.75 <1.7647→ insufficient.

Option I: (b)2.5 in → yes.

Option J: (b)2.25 in → yes.

Wait, no, option C is (a)1.75, (b)2.25.

Wait, the options are:

A: (a)1.5, (b)1.5

B: (a)2.25, (b)1.25

C: (a)1.75, (b)2.25

D: (a)2.0, (b)1.75

E: (a)2.5, (b)2.0

F: (a)1.0, (b)3.0

G: (a)3.5, (b)2.0

H: (a)2.75, (b)1.75

I: (a)3.25, (b)2.5

J: (a)3.0, (b)2.25

So for case (b), the correct L is ~1.7647 in. The options for (b) are:

A:1.5 → too short.

B:1.25 → too short.

C:2.25 → acceptable.

D:1.75 → just below minimum.

E:2.0 → acceptable.

So, looking for the minimum possible L that satisfies both shear and normal stresses, the correct L for (b) is ~1.7647 in. The options that are equal or higher than that are 2.0 in (option E's (b)) and 2.25 in (option C's (b)).

But wait, option C's (b) is 2.25, which is higher than required, but perhaps it's the correct option because it's the first one that meets the requirement.

But wait, let me calculate for L=1.75 in (option D's (b)):

Shear stress τ=7500/(0.5 *1.75)=7500/(0.875)=8571.43 psi, which is above the permissible 8500 psi. So it's not acceptable.

Thus, L must be just over 1.7647 in. The next option available is 2.0 in (option E's (b)).

Wait, but option C's (b) is 2.25, which is even higher. But perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the problem. Let me think again.

The key is subjected to shear and normal stresses. The maximum shear stress is given by τ = T/(w L ), and the maximum normal stress is σ = (T/(w t L )).

Wait, maybe I should use the formula that combines both stresses. The maximum allowable torque T_max can be found based on the allowable shear and normal stresses. But perhaps it's better to ensure that both stresses are within their limits.

For case (a):

w=0.75, t=0.5.

Shear stress τ = 7500/(0.75 L ) = 10000/L ≤8500 → L≥10000/8500≈1.176.

Normal stress σ =7500/(0.5*0.75*L )=7500/(0.375 L )=20000/L ≤16500 → L≥20000/16500≈1.212.

So L must be at least 1.212 in. The options for (a) are:

A:1.5 → acceptable.

C:1.75 → also acceptable.

But the minimum is ~1.212, so the smallest possible L from the options is 1.5 in (option A's (a)).

For case (b):

w=0.5, t=0.75.

Shear stress τ=7500/(0.5 L )=15000/L ≤8500 → L≥15000/8500≈1.7647.

Normal stress σ=7500/(0.75*0.5 L )=7500/(0.375 L )=20000/L ≤16500 → L≥20000/16500≈1.212.

So the limiting factor is shear stress, requiring L≥1.7647 in. Looking at the options, the only option where (b) is ≥1.7647 is option C's (b) 2.25 in and option E's (b) 2.0 in.

Wait, option E's (b) is 2.0 in, which is just below 1.7647? No, 2.0 is larger than 1.7647. So 2.0 in is acceptable.

But none of the options for (b) have exactly 1.7647; the closest higher value is 2.0 in (option E's (b)) or 2.25 in (option C's (b)).

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option C: (a)1.75, (b)2.25.

So for case (b), 2.25 in is acceptable.

But for case (a), 1.5 in is acceptable.

So the answer would be option A: (a)1.5, (b)1.5. But wait, option A's (b) is 1.5, which is shorter than 1.7647 in. So that's not acceptable.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the case (b) calculation.

Wait, for case (b), w=0.5, t=0.75.

Shear stress τ=7500/(0.5 L )=15000/L ≤8500 → L ≥15000/8500≈1.7647.

So the minimum L is ~1.7647 in. The options for (b) are:

A:1.5 → no.

B:1.25 → no.

C:2.25 → yes.

D:1.75 → 1.75 is less than 1.7647, so no.

E:2.0 → yes.

So the correct L for (b) is 2.0 in (option E's (b)) or higher.

But looking at the options, option E's (a) is 2.5 in, and (b) is 2.0 in.

Wait, but for case (a), the minimum is 1.212 in, which is met by 1.5 in (option A's (a)) and 1.75 in (option C's (a)).

So for case (a), the correct L is 1.5 in (option A's (a)), and for case (b), it's 2.0 in (option E's (b)). But looking at the options, none of them have (a) as 1.5 and (b) as 2.0. Wait, let me check the options again.

Looking back:

Option A: (a)1.5, (b)1.5 → (b) is too short.

Option B: (a)2.25, (b)1.25 → (b) too short.

Option C: (a)1.75, (b)2.25 → (a) is acceptable, (b) is acceptable.

Option D: (a)2.0, (b)1.75 → (b) is too short.

Option E: (a)2.5, (b)2.0 → (a) is longer than needed, (b) is acceptable.

So the correct option would be where (a) is 1.5 in and (b) is 2.0 in, but such an option isn't present. The closest is option C, which has (a)1.75 and (b)2.25.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Maybe I should use the formula for maximum shear stress and maximum normal stress separately and find L for each, then take the maximum.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for the normal stress is different. I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look for a standard approach.

Upon reviewing, perhaps the correct formula for the key length is L = T / (w * τ), where τ is the shear stress.

So for case (a):

L = 7500 / (0.75 * 8500 )=7500/(6375)=1.176 in.

But this only considers shear stress. We also need to check the normal stress.

Normal stress σ = T/(t * L^2 )

So σ=7500/(0.5 * (1.176)^2 )=7500/(0.5*1.383 )=7500/(0.6915 )≈10,845 psi, which is below 16,500 psi. So shear is the limiting factor.

Thus, L=1.176 in is acceptable, but since the options don't have this, the next higher option is 1.5 in (option A's (a)).

For case (b):

L=7500/(0.5 *8500 )=7500/(4250)=1.7647 in.

Check normal stress σ=7500/(0.75*(1.7647)^2 )=7500/(0.75*3.113 )=7500/(2.335 )≈3,209 psi, which is well below 16,500 psi.

Thus, L=1.7647 in is acceptable for case (b).

Looking at the options, the only option where (a) is 1.5 in and (b) is 1.75 in is option C: (a)1.75, (b)2.25. Wait, no, option C has (a)=1.75, which is higher than the required 1.176 in for (a). So perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm getting more confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A: (a)1.5, (b)1.5. But for (b), 1.5 is too short. So no.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the options and see which ones satisfy both cases.

Looking at option C: (a)=1.75, (b)=2.25.

For (a):

Shear stress τ=7500/(0.75*1.75)=7500/(1.3125)=5714 psi ≤8500.

Normal stress σ=7500/(0.5*(1.75)^2 )=7500/(0.5*3.0625)=7500/1.53125≈4901 psi ≤16500.

So acceptable.

For (b):

Shear stress τ=7500/(0.5*2.25)=7500/1.125=6666.67 ≤8500.

Normal stress σ=7500/(0.75*(2.25)^2 )=7500/(0.75*5.0625)=7500/3.7969≈1975.7 ≤16500.

Thus, option C's (a)=1.75 and (b)=2.25 are both acceptable.

But earlier calculations suggested that for (a), L=1.176 in is sufficient, but option C's (a) is 1.75 in, which is longer than needed. However, perhaps the correct approach is to take the maximum between the shear and normal stress requirements, which for (a) is 1.212 in, so 1.75 in is acceptable.

Thus, the correct option would be option C: (a)1.75 in, (b)2.25 in.

To solve the problem, the key length for both cases (a) and (b) is determined by ensuring that the shear and normal stresses in the key do not exceed their permissible limits. 

### Case (a): Thickness = 1/2 in., Width = 3/4 in.
1. **Shear Stress**:  
   Shear stress is calculated as:  
   \[
   \tau = \frac{T}{w \cdot L}
   \]  
   Substituting \( T = 7500 \, \text{in.-lb} \), \( w = 0.75 \, \text{in} \), and \( \tau_{\text{perm}} = 8500 \, \text{psi} \):  
   \[
   8500 = \frac{7500}{0.75 \cdot L} \implies L \geq \frac{7500}{0.75 \cdot 8500} \approx 1.176 \, \text{in}.
   \]

2. **Normal Stress**:  
   Normal stress is calculated as:  
   \[
   \sigma = \frac{T}{t \cdot L^2}
   \]  
   Substituting \( t = 0.5 \, \text{in} \), \( \sigma_{\text{perm}} = 16500 \, \text{psi} \):  
   \[
   16500 = \frac{7500}{0.5 \cdot L^2} \implies L^2 \geq \frac{7500}{0.5 \cdot 16500} \approx 0.9091 \implies L \geq \sqrt{0.9091} \approx 0.953 \, \text{in}.
   \]

   The limiting factor is the shear stress, so \( L \geq 1.176 \, \text{in} \). The closest option for (a) is **1.5 in.**.

### Case (b): Thickness = 3/4 in., Width = 1/2 in.
1. **Shear Stress**:  
   \[
   \tau = \frac{T}{w \cdot L}
   \]  
   Substituting \( w = 0.5 \, \text{in} \):  
   \[
   8500 = \frac{7500}{0.5 \cdot L} \implies L \geq \frac{7500}{0.5 \cdot 8500} \approx 1.765 \, \text{in}.
   \]

2. **Normal Stress**:  
   \[
   \sigma = \frac{T}{t \cdot L^2}
   \]  
   Substituting \( t = 0.75 \, \text{in} \):  
   \[
   16500 = \frac{7500}{0.75 \cdot L^2} \implies L^2 \geq \frac{7500}{0.75 \cdot 16500} \approx 0.606 \implies L \geq \sqrt{0.606} \approx 0.778 \, \text{in}.
   \]

   The limiting factor is the shear stress, so \( L \geq 1.765 \, \text{in} \). The closest option for (b) is **2.25 in.**.

### Final Answer:
For case (a), the key length is **1.5 in.**, and for case (b), the key length is **2.25 in.**. These values satisfy both shear and normal stress constraints.
