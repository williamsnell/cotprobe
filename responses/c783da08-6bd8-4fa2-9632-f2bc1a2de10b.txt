Question:

After graduating from law school, a graduate moved to a city where she had been offered a position in an entertainment law firm. When she arrived, the graduate was told that her job was contingent on passing the state bar examination, which was being offered in July. In preparing for the bar examination, the graduate planned to take a bar review course. Although she had not pre-enrolled, the graduate planned to attend and pay for the course at registration. On the morning the course was set to begin, the graduate arrived late after getting stuck in freeway traffic. By the time the graduate got to the course location, registration had already been completed. When the graduate looked into the room where the course was being conducted, she saw the lecture had begun, and everyone was inside busily taking notes. Panicky, the graduate picked up a set of course materials that were lying on the registration table and entered without paying. Although the graduate intended to pay the enrollment fee, no one was at the registration table to take her money. After attending the first couple of classes, the graduate sent a cashier's check for the full amount of the enrollment fee to the bar review company. Unbeknownst to the graduate, the bar review course's regional director noticed that she had entered the lectures without paying. After ascertaining her identity from a fellow student who knew the graduate, the company filed a complaint with the local prosecutor, and a warrant was issued for her arrest. The complaint charged the graduate with the crime of larceny by trick, for deliberately failing to pay for services rendered. After the complaint was issued, the graduate's check arrived at the company's office. The company deposited the check but failed to inform the prosecutor that payment had been received. The graduate was arrested and held in custody overnight before the matter was resolved. The graduate suffered severe emotional distress at the publicity she received in the local newspapers and the humiliation she suffered for being arrested and held in police custody. Terribly upset, the graduate was unable to take the bar exam and, thus, lost her job at the entertainment law firm. If the graduate asserts a claim against the bar-review company based on infliction of emotional distress, will she prevail?

Options:

A: Yes, because the graduate did not intend to defraud the company.
B: Yes, because the graduate was unfairly arrested and held in custody overnight.
C: No, because the company was within its rights to file a complaint when it noticed the graduate had attended without paying.
D: No, because filing-the complaint with the prosecutor was not outrageous conduct.
E: Yes, because the graduate ended up losing her job due to the emotional distress caused by the situation.
F: No, because the company did not intend to cause the graduate to suffer severe emotional distress.
G: Yes, because the company did not attempt to contact the graduate before filing a complaint.
H: No, because the graduate did initially attend the course without paying the enrollment fee.
I: Yes, because the company made no effort to inform the prosecutor that the registration fee had been paid in full.
J: No, because the graduate should have pre-enrolled for the course to ensure her spot.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the graduate can prevail in her claim against the bar-review company for infliction of emotional distress. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) requires that the defendant acted intentionally or recklessly, the conduct was outrageous, and the plaintiff suffered severe emotional distress as a result.

In this case, the graduate entered the course without paying because she was late and registration was over. She intended to pay, even sending a check later. The company noticed she didn't pay, identified her, and filed a complaint leading to her arrest. The check arrived after the complaint was filed but before the prosecutor was informed. She was arrested, held overnight, and then lost her job because of the stress.

Let me look at the options. Option A says yes because she didn't intend to defraud. But IIED isn't about intent to defraud; it's about intent to cause distress or reckless disregard. So maybe A isn't the right reason, but the outcome might still be yes.

Option B says yes because she was unfairly arrested. But whether the arrest was justified is a separate issue from whether the company's actions were outrageous. The company's actions led to the arrest, but if they were lawful, that might not count as outrageous.

Option C says no because the company had the right to file the complaint. That makes sense because if she didn't pay, the company can take legal action. So their conduct might not be considered outrageous.

Option D says no because filing the complaint wasn't outrageous. Outrageous conduct is extreme and beyond all possible bounds of decency. Filing a complaint when she didn't pay might be seen as a legal right, not outrageous.

Option E says yes because she lost her job. But IIED requires more than just bad consequences; the conduct must be outrageous. Losing the job is a result, but not necessarily enough on its own.

Option F says no because the company didn't intend to cause distress. That's true, but IIED can be based on reckless disregard. The company's intent isn't the key here; it's the nature of their conduct.

Option G says yes because they didn't contact her before filing. Maybe the company should have given her a chance to pay, but was that required? If she intended to pay and did send a check, maybe the company should have waited, but I'm not sure if that's considered outrageous.

Option H says no because she didn't pay initially. That's a fact, but the issue is whether the company's response was reasonable. Filing a complaint after she attended without paying could be seen as appropriate.

Option I says yes because they didn't inform the prosecutor after receiving the check. That's a point. Once they got the payment, they should have withdrawn the complaint, but did they have a duty to do so? If they didn't, then maybe not.

Option J says no because she should have pre-enrolled. But the question says she planned to pay at registration, so maybe it's not her fault she was late.

Putting it all together, the key issue is whether filing the complaint was outrageous. The company took action because she didn't pay, which they had the right to do. However, after receiving the check, they didn't inform the prosecutor, leading to her unnecessary arrest. That could be seen as reckless or outrageous because they continued with the complaint even after the debt was settled. So maybe option D is incorrect because their conduct was indeed outrageous in continuing after payment.

Wait, but IIED requires that the conduct be so extreme that it goes beyond all possible bounds of decency. Filing a complaint when she didn't pay might be justified, but continuing after payment might be seen as outrageous. So perhaps the correct answer is D, saying it's not outrageous, because the initial action wasn't beyond decency. Alternatively, maybe I is correct because they didn't inform the prosecutor after payment, making their conduct reckless.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The company's actions were to file a complaint when she didn't pay. That's their right. But when she sent the check, which they cashed, they didn't inform the prosecutor. So they continued with the complaint even after being paid. That might be considered reckless because they should have withdrawn it. So their conduct after payment could be seen as outrageous.

If that's the case, then maybe option D is incorrect, and the answer would be yes because the conduct was outrageous. But looking at the options, option D says no because filing the complaint wasn't outrageous. So perhaps the correct answer is D, because the act of filing the complaint wasn't itself outrageous, even if they didn't inform the prosecutor later.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is D, because the filing wasn't outrageous, even if they mishandled it afterward. I'm getting a bit stuck here. I think the key is whether the company's conduct was so extreme. Filing a complaint when someone doesn't pay isn't necessarily outrageous. It's more about whether they went beyond what's reasonable. So perhaps D is correct, that filing the complaint wasn't outrageous.

The graduate's claim hinges on whether the bar-review company's actions were outrageous under the standard for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED). The company filed a complaint after the graduate attended without paying, leading to her arrest. While the company had the right to pursue payment, their failure to inform the prosecutor after receiving her check could be seen as reckless. However, the act of filing the complaint itself, while perhaps flawed, may not rise to the level of being "outrageous" as defined by law, which requires conduct to be extreme and beyond all possible bounds of decency. Therefore, the company's initial action was within their rights and not sufficiently outrageous to support an IIED claim.
