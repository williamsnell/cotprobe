Okay, so I have this question about natural selection and the smallest unit it acts upon. Let me think through this. I remember from my biology class that natural selection is a key mechanism of evolution. It's about how certain traits become more common in a population over time because they provide some advantage.

The question asks which is the smallest unit upon which natural selection directly acts. The options are A to J, each describing different units like genome, genetic variation, etc. I need to figure out which one is the right answer.

I recall that natural selection works at the level of the individual. Because it's the individual organisms that compete for resources, survive, and reproduce. The traits that affect their survival and reproduction are what get selected. So the unit must be something related to the individual.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. Option A is an individual's genome. The genome is all the genetic material, but natural selection doesn't directly act on the entire genome. It acts on specific traits, which are parts of the genome. So maybe A isn't the smallest unit.

Option B is a population's genetic variation. That's about the diversity in a group, but natural selection isn't acting on the population as a whole. It's the individuals within the population that are being selected, so B might not be the right choice.

Option C is a species' genetic mutation. Mutations are changes in the DNA, but again, natural selection doesn't act on the species level. It's the individual mutations that affect the organism's phenotype, which then influences selection. So C is probably not it.

Option D is an individual's genetic makeup. This sounds closer to what I was thinking. The genetic makeup includes all the genes, so the traits that affect survival and reproduction are part of the individual's genetic makeup. So D seems like a contender.

Option E is a population's gene frequency. Gene frequency is about how common a gene is in a population. But natural selection affects the gene frequencies indirectly by selecting individuals with certain alleles. So E is more about the result of selection, not the unit it acts upon.

Option F is a population's genetic makeup. Similar to E, this is at a group level, so selection doesn't directly act here. It's the individuals that are selected, which affects the population's genetic makeup over time.

Option G is an individual's phenotype. The phenotype is the physical expression of the genes, like height or color. While natural selection can act on the phenotype because those traits determine survival and reproductive success, the question is about the unit. The actual unit that selection acts upon is the genetic makeup that produces the phenotype. So maybe G is not the smallest unit because the phenotype is a result of the genes.

Option H is a species' genetic diversity. This is too broad; selection doesn't act on the species as a whole. It's individual organisms that matter.

Option I is a species' gene frequency. Again, this is a population or species-level measure, not the unit of selection.

Option J is an individual's genetic mutation. Mutations are changes in the DNA, but selection doesn't directly act on individual mutations. It's the overall genetic makeup that affects the organism's fitness.

Wait, so I need to decide between D and G. Both involve the individual. D is about genetic makeup, which is the genotype, while G is the phenotype. Natural selection can't directly see the genotype; it sees the phenotype. But the actual unit upon which selection acts is the individual's genetic makeup because the traits that are selected are based on their genes. Or is it the phenotype?

I think the confusion is whether the unit is the genotype or phenotype. From what I remember, natural selection acts on the phenotype because that's what's visible and affects survival. However, the genetic makeup (genotype) determines the phenotype, and the selection indirectly affects the genotype over time because the phenotype influences reproductive success.

But the question is asking for the smallest unit upon which natural selection directly acts. So perhaps it's the phenotype because that's the trait that is selected. But another perspective is that selection acts on the genetic information because that's what gets passed on. Wait, no, because selection doesn't directly act on the genes themselves but on the traits.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again. The process of natural selection involves individuals with certain traits (phenotypes) being more likely to survive and reproduce. So the selection pressure acts on the phenotype, but the genetic makeup determines the phenotype. So does the question consider the genetic makeup or the phenotype as the unit?

I think the correct answer is D: an individual's genetic makeup. Because natural selection doesn't directly act on the phenotype but on the genetic information that leads to the phenotype. Or wait, no. Wait, no, because the phenotype is what's exposed to the environment. So the selection acts on the phenotype, but the genetic makeup is the underlying cause.

Wait, the question is about the smallest unit. So the smallest unit would be the individual's genetic makeup because it's the genes that are passed on. But some sources say that natural selection acts on the phenotype, not the genotype. So I'm a bit confused.

Let me look it up in my notes. Oh right, Darwin's theory of natural selection says that individuals with advantageous traits survive better and reproduce more. The traits are phenotypic, so selection acts on the phenotype. However, the genetic makeup (genotype) determines the phenotype. So the unit of selection is the individual's phenotype, but the genetic makeup is what's being passed on.

Wait, but the question is about the unit upon which selection directly acts. So perhaps it's the individual's phenotype (G), but another perspective is that the unit is the allele or gene, but that's not an option here.

Wait, the options don't have 'allele' as an option. The options are about the individual's genome, genetic makeup, etc. So looking back, the smallest unit would be the individual's genetic makeup because that's the heritable component. Alternatively, the phenotype is the actual trait that's selected.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the options again. The question asks for the smallest unit upon which natural selection directly acts.

Option G is the individual's phenotype. Option D is the individual's genetic makeup.

I think the correct answer is G because natural selection can't see the genotype directly; it's the phenotype that interacts with the environment. But wait, the genetic makeup is what's being acted upon in terms of passing on genes. No, the selection doesn't act on the genes directly but on the traits.

Wait, here's another way: the unit of selection is the individual. The individual's traits (phenotype) determine their fitness. So the smallest unit is the individual's phenotype. So G would be the answer.

But some sources say that natural selection acts on the genotype because that's what determines the phenotype and gets passed on. But that's more about evolutionary genetics. I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D because the genetic makeup is the heritable unit, and selection indirectly affects the gene frequencies through the survival and reproduction of individuals.

Wait, but the question is about the unit upon which selection directly acts. So the individual's phenotype is the unit because that's what is selected based on environmental pressures. The genetic makeup is the underlying cause, but the direct action is on the phenotype.

So perhaps the answer is G.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The process is that individuals with certain traits survive and reproduce more. So the traits (phenotypes) are what selection acts upon. Therefore, the unit is the individual's phenotype, which is option G.

Wait, but I've also heard that natural selection acts on the genotype because it's the genotype that is heritable. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is D: an individual's genetic makeup. Because the genetic makeup includes all the genes, and the traits are a result of that. So selection indirectly affects the genetic makeup by selecting for certain traits.

But I'm not entirely sure. I think I need to recall what the standard answer is. From what I remember, the unit of selection is the individual, specifically the phenotype. So the answer is G.

Wait, but the options don't have 'individual' as a standalone. The options are about the individual's genome, genetic makeup, etc.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The smallest unit is the individual. The options that refer to the individual are A, D, G, J.

A is genome, which is part of the individual. D is genetic makeup. G is phenotype.

Natural selection acts on the phenotype because that's what is visible and affects survival. So the smallest unit is the individual's phenotype, which is option G.

But I've also heard that natural selection works on the genetic level. Wait, no, because selection doesn't see the genotype directly; it's the phenotype that matters in terms of fitness.

So the correct answer should be G: an individual's phenotype.

The question asks for the smallest unit upon which natural selection directly acts. Natural selection is a mechanism of evolution that favors traits that enhance survival and reproductive success. To determine the correct answer, it is important to consider whether natural selection acts on the genotype or the phenotype.

- **Option A (an individual's genome):** The genome is the complete set of genetic material, but natural selection does not directly act on the entire genome. It acts on specific traits, which are determined by parts of the genome. Thus, this is not the smallest unit.
  
- **Option B (a population's genetic variation):** Genetic variation refers to diversity within a population. However, natural selection acts on individual organisms, not the population as a whole. This is too broad to be the smallest unit.
  
- **Option C (a species' genetic mutation):** Mutations occur at the DNA level, but natural selection does not act directly on mutations. It acts on traits, which are influenced by mutations. This is not the correct unit.
  
- **Option D (an individual's genetic makeup):** The genetic makeup (genotype) determines the traits (phenotype) of an individual. While natural selection indirectly affects the genetic makeup by selecting for advantageous traits, it does not directly act on the genotype.
  
- **Option E (a population's gene frequency):** Gene frequency is a measure of how common a gene is in a population. Natural selection affects gene frequencies over time, but it does not directly act on the population's gene frequencies.
  
- **Option F (a population's genetic makeup):** Similar to option E, this refers to the genetic makeup of a group, not individual organisms. Natural selection acts on individuals, not populations as a whole.
  
- **Option G (an individual's phenotype):** The phenotype is the physical expression of an individual's traits, which are directly exposed to environmental pressures. Natural selection acts on the phenotype because it determines an individual's survival and reproductive success. This is the smallest unit upon which natural selection directly acts.
  
- **Option H (a species' genetic diversity):** This is a broad measure of genetic variation across a species. Natural selection does not act on the species level but on individual organisms.
  
- **Option I (a species' gene frequency):** Similar to options E and F, this refers to a population-level measure. Natural selection does not directly act on gene frequencies but influences them indirectly through individual traits.
  
- **Option J (an individual's genetic mutation):** Mutations are changes in DNA, but natural selection does not directly act on individual mutations. It acts on the traits that result from the genetic makeup.

While natural selection indirectly affects the genetic makeup (genotype) by favoring certain traits (phenotype), the smallest unit upon which natural selection directly acts is the phenotype, as it is the traits that determine an individual's survival and reproductive success. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: G**
