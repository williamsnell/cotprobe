Alright, so I've got this problem about a cubical tank of water cooling down after the heater is turned off. I'm a bit rusty on my heat transfer, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Okay, the problem states that the tank has a volume of 1 m³. Since it's a cube, each side should be 1m because 1m³ is 1x1x1. But wait, do I need the side length? Maybe for surface area calculations, but let me think. The formula for heat loss in such cases usually involves the surface area, but I might not need it if I'm using the lumped capacitance method. Hmm.

The heater is 1 kW and keeps the water at 65°C. When it's turned off, the water will cool down to room temperature, which is 15°C. I need to find the time it takes to cool from 65°C to 50°C.

I remember Newton's Law of Cooling applies here. The formula is T(t) = T_s + (T_initial - T_s) * e^(-t/τ), where τ is the time constant. Alternatively, the time constant τ is related to the thermal resistance and the heat capacity.

But wait, the time constant τ is equal to the volume divided by the surface area multiplied by the thermal conductivity, but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, for lumped systems, τ = V/(hA), where h is the convective heat transfer coefficient, and A is the surface area.

But I don't have the value of h. Hmm, how do I proceed without h? Maybe the problem expects me to assume a specific value or use another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to use the formula in terms of the heater power.

Wait, the heater is 1 kW and it's maintaining the temperature at 65°C. So the power P equals the heat transfer rate Q. When the heater is on, the heat loss from the tank is equal to the heater's power. So Q = P = 1 kW.

But when the heater is off, the heat loss will cause the temperature to drop. So maybe I can find the cooling constant or the time constant from the heater's power.

Let me think. The heat loss from the tank when the heater is on is equal to the heater's power. So Q = h * A * (T_tank - T_room). But I don't know h or A directly. But since the volume is 1 m³ and it's a cube, each side is 1m, so the surface area A is 6*(1m)^2 = 6 m².

So when the heater is on, the heat transfer equation is P = h * A * (T_tank - T_room). Plugging in the numbers: 1000 W = h * 6 m² * (65°C - 15°C). So 1000 = h * 6 * 50. That gives h = 1000 / (6*50) = 1000/300 ≈ 3.333 W/(m²·°C).

Now that I have h, I can find the time constant τ. τ = V/(h*A). Wait, V is 1 m³, h is 3.333, A is 6 m².

So τ = 1 / (3.333 * 6) = 1 / 20 ≈ 0.05 hours? Wait, no, because the units. Wait, h is in W/(m²·°C), which is equivalent to J/(s·m²·°C). But the volume is in m³, so let's see:

Wait, τ has units of seconds, right? Let me make sure. τ = V/(h*A). V is m³, h is W/(m²·°C) = J/(s·m²·°C), A is m². So V/(h*A) has units (m³) / [ (J/(s·m²·°C)) * m² ) ] = m³ / (J/(s·°C)) ) → m³ * s·°C / J. Hmm, but J is kg·m²/s², so let's see:

m³ * s * °C / (kg·m²/s²) ) = (m³ * s * °C) / (kg·m²/s²) ) = (m * s³ * °C) / kg. Hmm, I'm getting stuck on units. Maybe I should just compute numerically.

Wait, τ = V/(h*A) = 1 m³ / (3.333 W/(m²·°C) * 6 m²) ) → 1 / (3.333 * 6) → 1 / 20 → 0.05 hours? Wait, that can't be right because 0.05 hours is 3 minutes, which seems too short for the time given in the options.

Wait, maybe I should convert h into the correct units. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula τ = (mass * specific heat) / (h * A). Oh, right! Because the time constant is related to the thermal capacity (mass * specific heat) divided by the surface heat transfer coefficient times the surface area.

So τ = (m * c_p) / (h * A). That makes more sense.

I have the volume, so mass m is volume * density. Water's density is 1000 kg/m³, so m = 1 * 1000 = 1000 kg.

Specific heat capacity of water, c_p ≈ 4186 J/(kg·°C).

So τ = (1000 kg * 4186 J/(kg·°C)) / (3.333 W/(m²·°C) * 6 m²).

Calculating numerator: 1000 * 4186 = 4,186,000 J/°C.

Denominator: 3.333 * 6 = 20 W/°C.

So τ = 4,186,000 / 20 = 209,300 seconds.

Convert seconds to hours: 209300 / 3600 ≈ 58.14 hours. Hmm, but that's way longer than the options given. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me double-check. The time constant τ is (mass * c_p) / (h * A). Yes, that's correct.

But wait, when the heater is on, the heat loss is equal to the heater's power. So P = h * A * (T_tank - T_room). We used that to find h, which seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula for Newton's law and find the time it takes for the temperature to drop from 65 to 50, which is a 15°C drop.

The formula for temperature as a function of time is T(t) = T_s + (T_initial - T_s) * e^(-t/τ). So the change in temperature ΔT = T_initial - T_final = 15°C.

So ΔT = (T_initial - T_s) * (1 - e^(-t/τ)).

We know that when the heater is on, the steady-state temperature is 65°C, so when it's off, it will cool down to 15°C.

Wait, no. When the heater is on, the water is kept at 65°C. When the heater is off, it will cool to room temperature, which is 15°C.

So the initial temperature is 65°C, and the final is 15°C. The room is at 15°C, so that's T_s.

So the temperature change from 65 to 50 is a drop of 15°C.

So using the formula:

ΔT = (T_initial - T_s) * (1 - e^(-t/τ)).

We can rearrange to solve for t.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe it's better to use the formula for the rate of cooling.

Wait, another approach: The power of the heater when on is equal to the rate of heat loss, which is h*A*(T_tank - T_room). So when the heater is off, the rate of temperature change is dT/dt = -(h*A)/(m*c_p) * (T - T_s). That's the differential equation for Newton's law.

The solution is T(t) = T_s + (T_initial - T_s) * e^(-t/τ), where τ = (m c_p)/(h A).

So first, let's compute τ correctly.

We have m = 1000 kg, c_p = 4186 J/(kg·°C), h = 3.333 W/(m²·°C), A = 6 m².

So τ = (1000 * 4186) / (3.333 * 6) = (4,186,000) / 20 ≈ 209,300 seconds.

Convert τ to hours: 209300 / 3600 ≈ 58.14 hours.

Now, we need to find the time t when the temperature drops from 65 to 50°C, which is a drop of 15°C.

So ΔT = 15°C = (65 - 15) * (1 - e^(-t/τ)).

So 15 = 50 * (1 - e^(-t/58.14)).

Divide both sides by 50: 0.3 = 1 - e^(-t/58.14).

So e^(-t/58.14) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

Take natural log: -t/58.14 = ln(0.7) ≈ -0.35667.

Multiply both sides by -58.14: t ≈ 0.35667 * 58.14 ≈ 20.7 hours.

Wait, that's approximately 20.7 hours, which is close to option A: 20.64 hr.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation for τ. Because when I calculated τ earlier, I got 58.14 hours, but that seems too long. Let me recompute:

τ = (m c_p) / (h A) = (1000 kg * 4186 J/kg°C) / (3.333 W/m²°C * 6 m²).

Compute numerator: 1000 * 4186 = 4,186,000 J/°C.

Denominator: 3.333 * 6 = 20 W/°C.

So τ = 4,186,000 / 20 = 209,300 seconds.

Convert to hours: 209300 / 3600 ≈ 58.14 hours. Yes, that's correct.

Then, the equation: 15 = 50*(1 - e^{-t/58.14}).

So 0.3 = 1 - e^{-t/58.14} → e^{-t/58.14} = 0.7.

Take ln: -t/58.14 = ln(0.7) ≈ -0.35667.

So t ≈ 0.35667 * 58.14 ≈ 20.7 hours.

Looking at the options, option A is 20.64 hr, which is very close. So the answer should be A.

To solve the problem, we use Newton's Law of Cooling. The heater maintains the water at 65°C by counteracting the heat loss. When the heater is turned off, the water cools down to room temperature (15°C). The heat transfer coefficient \( h \) is determined using the heater's power and the surface area of the tank. The time constant \( \tau \) is then calculated using the mass, specific heat, and surface area. Using the formula for temperature decay under Newton's Law, the time to cool from 65°C to 50°C is found to be approximately 20.64 hours.
