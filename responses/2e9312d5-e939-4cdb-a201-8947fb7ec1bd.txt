Okay, so I have this problem about a tank with saltwater flowing in and out. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

First, the tank initially has 100 gallons of fresh water, so no salt at the beginning. Then, they start pouring in saltwater. The saltwater has 1/2 lb of salt per gallon, and it's being added at a rate of 2 gallons per minute. The mixture is allowed to leave the tank at the same rate, 2 gallons per minute. This process goes on for 10 minutes, and then it's stopped. After that, fresh water is poured in at the same rate of 2 gallons per minute, and the mixture leaves at the same rate. We need to find the amount of salt in the tank after an additional 10 minutes, so total of 20 minutes from the start.

Hmm, okay. So this is a classic mixing problem, probably involving differential equations. Let me break it down into two parts: the first 10 minutes when saltwater is being added and removed, and the next 10 minutes when only fresh water is added, but the mixture is still leaving.

First, let's tackle the first 10 minutes. 

The inflow is saltwater with concentration 1/2 lb/gal at 2 gal/min. So the rate of salt entering the tank is (1/2) lb/gal * 2 gal/min = 1 lb/min.

The outflow is the mixture, so the concentration of salt in the tank at any time t will determine how much salt leaves per minute. Let me denote S(t) as the amount of salt in the tank at time t. The volume of the tank is initially 100 gal, and since inflow and outflow rates are equal, the volume remains constant at 100 gal throughout.

Therefore, the concentration at time t is S(t)/100 lb/gal. The outflow rate of salt is then (S(t)/100) * 2 gal/min = (2 S(t))/100 = S(t)/50 lb/min.

So the rate of change of salt in the tank is:

dS/dt = inflow - outflow = 1 - (S(t)/50)

This is a differential equation. Let me solve it. 

The equation is dS/dt = 1 - (S(t)/50). This is a linear differential equation and can be solved using an integrating factor. 

First, rewrite it as:

dS/dt + (1/50) S(t) = 1

The integrating factor is e^{∫(1/50) dt} = e^{t/50}.

Multiply both sides by the integrating factor:

e^{t/50} dS/dt + (1/50) e^{t/50} S(t) = e^{t/50} * 1

The left side is the derivative of (S(t) e^{t/50}) with respect to t.

So, d/dt [S(t) e^{t/50}] = e^{t/50}

Integrate both sides from 0 to t:

S(t) e^{t/50} - S(0) e^{0} = ∫0^t e^{τ/50} dτ

We know S(0) = 0 because the tank starts with fresh water.

So,

S(t) e^{t/50} = ∫0^t e^{τ/50} dτ

Compute the integral:

∫ e^{τ/50} dτ = 50 e^{τ/50} + C

Evaluate from 0 to t:

50 e^{t/50} - 50 e^{0} = 50(e^{t/50} - 1)

So,

S(t) e^{t/50} = 50(e^{t/50} - 1)

Multiply both sides by e^{-t/50}:

S(t) = 50(e^{t/50} - 1) e^{-t/50} = 50(1 - e^{-t/50})

So after 10 minutes, S(10) = 50(1 - e^{-10/50}) = 50(1 - e^{-0.2})

Let me compute e^{-0.2}. I remember that e^{-0.2} ≈ 0.8187.

So S(10) ≈ 50*(1 - 0.8187) = 50*(0.1813) ≈ 9.065 lb.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because 50*(0.1813) is 9.065. But wait, the inflow rate is 1 lb/min for 10 minutes, so total salt would be 10 lb. But due to outflow, it's less, so 9.065 makes sense.

So after 10 minutes, the salt is about 9.065 lb.

Now, the process is stopped, and fresh water is poured in at 2 gal/min, with mixture leaving at 2 gal/min. So now, the inflow is fresh water, so no salt is added. The outflow is still the mixture, so the concentration is S(t)/100 lb/gal.

So now, the rate of change of salt is:

dS/dt = 0 (inflow) - (S(t)/100)*2 = - (2 S(t))/100 = - S(t)/50

This is a differential equation: dS/dt = -S(t)/50

This is a simple exponential decay. The solution is S(t) = S_0 e^{-t/50}, where S_0 is the amount of salt at the start of this phase, which is 9.065 lb.

We need to find the amount after an additional 10 minutes, so t = 10.

So S(20) = 9.065 * e^{-10/50} = 9.065 * e^{-0.2}

We already know e^{-0.2} ≈ 0.8187.

So S(20) ≈ 9.065 * 0.8187 ≈ let's compute this.

9.065 * 0.8 = 7.252

9.065 * 0.0187 ≈ 9.065 * 0.02 ≈ 0.1813, but 0.0187 is 0.02 minus 0.0013, so approximately 0.1813 - (9.065 * 0.0013) ≈ 0.1813 - 0.0118 ≈ 0.1695

So total ≈ 7.252 + 0.1695 ≈ 7.4215 lb.

Looking at the options, B is 7.42 lb, which matches closely.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes approximations can lead to small errors.

First, compute e^{-0.2}: more accurately, e^{-0.2} is approximately 0.818730753.

So S(10) = 50*(1 - e^{-0.2}) ≈ 50*(1 - 0.818730753) = 50*(0.181269247) = 9.06346235 lb.

Then, after another 10 minutes, S = 9.06346235 * e^{-0.2} ≈ 9.06346235 * 0.818730753.

Let me compute that:

9 * 0.818730753 ≈ 7.36857678

0.06346235 * 0.818730753 ≈ 0.0520885

Adding together: 7.36857678 + 0.0520885 ≈ 7.4206653 lb.

So approximately 7.4207 lb, which rounds to 7.42 lb, matching option B.

Wait, but let me check: in the first part, after 10 minutes, is S(10) exactly 50*(1 - e^{-0.2})? Because the initial condition was S(0) = 0, correct.

Yes, because integrating from 0 to t=10, so that's correct.

So the calculation seems accurate, leading to option B: 7.42 lb.

The problem involves a tank with saltwater inflow and outflow, followed by fresh water inflow. The first 10 minutes involve saltwater inflow, leading to a differential equation solved as \( S(t) = 50(1 - e^{-t/50}) \). After 10 minutes, \( S(10) ≈ 9.065 \) lb. The next 10 minutes involve fresh water inflow, leading to exponential decay \( S(t) = S_0 e^{-t/50} \). After another 10 minutes, the salt is approximately \( 7.42 \) lb. 

Answer: B
