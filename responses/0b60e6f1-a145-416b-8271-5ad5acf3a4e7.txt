Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the net cost of a tape recorder. The list price is $32, and there's a 30% discount. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me think about how discounts work.

First, I remember that a discount reduces the original price. So, a 30% discount means the customer pays 70% of the original price because 100% - 30% = 70%. Wait, is that right? Yeah, because 30% off would leave 70% of what you'd pay. So I need to calculate 70% of $32.

How do I calculate 70% of 32? Well, I can convert the percentage to a decimal. 70% is 0.7. So I multiply 32 by 0.7. Let me do the math: 32 * 0.7. Let's see, 30 * 0.7 is 21, and 2 * 0.7 is 1.4, so adding them together gives 22.4. So the net cost is $22.40.

Looking at the options, I see option F is $22.40. So that should be the correct answer. But wait, let me double-check. Sometimes I make mistakes in calculations. Alternatively, I can think of 30% of 32. 10% is 3.2, so 30% is 3.2 * 3 = 9.6. Subtracting that from 32 would give 32 - 9.6 = 22.4. Yep, that's the same result. So I'm confident that option F is correct.

The net cost calculation involves applying the discount:

1. **List price**: $32
2. **Discount rate**: 30%
3. **Amount of discount**: 30% of $32 = 0.3 Ã— 32 = $9.60
4. **Net cost**: $32 - $9.60 = $22.40

Answer: F: $22.40

Answer: F
