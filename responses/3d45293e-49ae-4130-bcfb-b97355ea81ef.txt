Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the mass of the electron using the results from Millikan's and Thomson's experiments. Hmm, let's start by recalling what each of them did.

Millikan's oil drop experiment determined the charge of the electron, right? I think he found that the charge q is approximately 1.6 × 10^-19 coulombs. Yeah, that's the elementary charge. So q = 1.6e-19 C.

Then there's J.J. Thomson, who did the cathode ray experiment. From that, he measured the ratio of charge to mass, q/m. I remember that ratio is about 1.76 × 10^11 C/kg. So q/m = 1.76e11 C/kg.

Wait, but if I have q and q/m, I can find m by rearranging the ratio. Since q/m = 1.76e11, then m = q / (q/m). Oh right, because m = q / (q/m) → m = (q * m_e) / q → no, wait, that's not right. Let me think again. Oh, no, actually, the ratio is q/m_e, so m_e = q / (q/m_e). Wait, q/m_e is the ratio, so m_e = q / (q/m_e) → m_e = (q) * (m_e/q) → that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I should write it as m_e = q / (q/m_e). Wait, no, the ratio is q/m_e = 1.76e11, so m_e = q / (1.76e11).

Yes, that makes sense. So m_e = (1.6e-19 C) / (1.76e11 C/kg) → because (C) in numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving kg.

Calculating that: 1.6e-19 divided by 1.76e11. Let me compute that. 1.6 / 1.76 is approximately 0.909, and then 1e-19 divided by 1e11 is 1e-30. So 0.909e-30 kg, which is 9.09e-31 kg. Wait, but looking at the options, I see option I is 9.1 × 10^-31 kg. Oh, that's very close. So the mass of the electron should be about 9.1e-31 kg.

Wait, let me double-check. Another way to think: 1.6e-19 divided by 1.76e11. Let me compute 1.6 / 1.76. Hmm, 1.76 is 176/100, and 1.6 is 160/100. So 160/176 = 10/11 ≈ 0.909. So 0.909e-30 kg = 9.09e-31 kg. So the closest option is I: 9.1 × 10^-31 kg.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 5.5e-31 kg, which is much smaller. Did I make a mistake in the exponents? Let me check the calculation again. 1.6e-19 C divided by 1.76e11 C/kg. So exponents: 1e-19 / 1e11 = 1e-30. So 1.6/1.76 is ~0.909. So 0.909e-30 = 9.09e-31 kg. So yes, that's correct.

To calculate the mass of the electron, we use the charge of the electron \( q \) determined by Millikan and the charge-to-mass ratio \( \frac{q}{m} \) measured by J.J. Thomson. The charge \( q \) is approximately \( 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \), and the ratio \( \frac{q}{m} \) is approximately \( 1.76 \times 10^{11} \, \text{C/kg} \). 

The mass \( m \) can be calculated as:

\[
m = \frac{q}{\frac{q}{m}} = \frac{1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}}{1.76 \times 10^{11} \, \text{C/kg}} = 9.1 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg}.
\]

This matches option I.
