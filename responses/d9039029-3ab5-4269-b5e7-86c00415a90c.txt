Okay, so I need to figure out which civilization the Maya derived their writing and mathematics from. The options are A to J, including Aztecs, Greeks, Sumerians, Chavin, Chinese, Olmec, Egyptians, Romans, Inca, and Mesopotamians.

Hmm, I remember that the Maya were an advanced Mesoamerican civilization, known for their hieroglyphic writing, complex mathematics, and astronomy. But where did they get all that from? I think they might have been influenced by earlier cultures in the region.

Wait, the Olmec are often called the "mother culture" of Mesoamerica. They were one of the earliest major civilizations in the area, around what's now Mexico and Guatemala. The Olmec are credited with developing writing systems and calendars, which could have been sources for the Maya.

I also recall that the Sumerians and Mesopotamians were early in developing writing, like cuneiform, but they were in the Fertile Crescent, which is in the Middle East. The Maya are in Central America, so I'm not sure if they directly took from Mesopotamians. The Greeks and Romans were also advanced, but again, they're in Europe, so maybe less likely.

The Aztecs and Inca were later empires, so the Maya probably predated them. The Chinese were far to the east, so maybe less direct influence. The Egyptians had hieroglyphs, but again, geographically distant.

So putting it together, the Olmec were the earliest and in the same region. They likely influenced the Maya's writing and math systems. Therefore, the answer should be F: Olmec.
