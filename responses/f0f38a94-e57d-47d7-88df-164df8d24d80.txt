Okay, so I've got this economics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me see. The question is about the income velocity of money. Hmm, I remember that velocity of money is a concept in economics that relates the money supply to the overall economic output, like GDP or GNP. 

The problem gives me the 1964 GNP, which is $622 billion, and the average money supply, which was $155 billion. I think the formula for velocity of money is something like V = GNP / Money Supply. Does that sound right? Yeah, I think that's how it goes. So, I should take the GNP and divide it by the money supply to get the velocity.

Let me write that down. So, V equals 622 divided by 155. Let me calculate that. 622 divided by 155. Hmm, doing this in my head... Well, 155 times 4 is 620. Oh, so 4 times 155 is 620, and 622 is just 2 more. So, 622 divided by 155 is approximately 4.0129. Wait, that makes sense because 4 times 155 is 620, plus 2 is 622, so it's 4 and 2/155. Let me check that. 2 divided by 155 is roughly 0.0129, so yeah, 4.0129 times.

Looking at the options, option C is 4.0129 times, which matches exactly what I got. So that must be the correct answer. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the formula. Velocity of money is GNP (or GDP) divided by money supply. Yeah, that's right. So, 622 / 155 = approximately 4.0129. So option C is correct.

The income velocity of money is calculated by dividing the GNP by the money supply. Using the given values, 622 billion divided by 155 billion equals approximately 4.0129. 

Answer: C
