Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a camper pouring coffee into an aluminum cup, and I need to find the equilibrium temperature. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says that the camper pours 0.300 kg of coffee into an aluminum cup. The coffee is initially at 70.0°C, and the cup is at 20.0°C. We’re supposed to assume that the coffee has the same specific heat as water, which I remember is around 4186 J/(kg·°C). The cup is aluminum, so I need its specific heat too. I think aluminum's specific heat is about 900 J/(kg·°C), but wait, I should double-check that. I recall that aluminum has a lower specific heat than water. Yes, so 900 J/(kg·°C) sounds right.

The setup is a heat transfer problem. Since the cup and coffee are in contact, heat will flow from the hotter coffee to the cooler cup until they reach the same temperature, which is the equilibrium temperature we're trying to find. And the problem states that no heat is lost to the surroundings, so all the heat lost by the coffee goes into the cup.

I remember the formula for heat transfer is Q = mcΔT, where m is mass, c is specific heat, and ΔT is the change in temperature. Since heat lost by coffee equals heat gained by the cup, I can set up an equation where Q_coffee = Q_cup.

Let me write that out. The heat lost by the coffee is m_coffee * c_water * (T_coffee_initial - T_equilibrium). The heat gained by the cup is m_cup * c_aluminum * (T_equilibrium - T_cup_initial). So:

m_coffee * c_water * (T_initial_coffee - T_eq) = m_cup * c_aluminum * (T_eq - T_initial_cup)

Plugging in the numbers:

0.300 kg * 4186 J/(kg·°C) * (70.0 - T_eq) = 0.120 kg * 900 J/(kg·°C) * (T_eq - 20.0)

Let me compute each part. First, calculate the left side:

0.300 * 4186 = 1255.8 J/°C. So the left side becomes 1255.8*(70 - T_eq).

On the right side: 0.120 *900 = 108 J/°C. So right side is 108*(T_eq -20).

So the equation is:

1255.8*(70 - T_eq) = 108*(T_eq -20)

Let me expand both sides.

Left: 1255.8 *70 = 87,906 J, and 1255.8*(-T_eq) = -1255.8 T_eq.

Right: 108*T_eq = 108 T_eq, and 108*(-20) = -2160 J.

So the equation becomes:

87,906 - 1255.8 T_eq = 108 T_eq - 2160

I'll bring all terms to one side. Let's move all T_eq terms to the left and constants to the right.

So, add 1255.8 T_eq to both sides:

87,906 = 108 T_eq + 1255.8 T_eq - 2160

Combine like terms on the right: 108 + 1255.8 = 1363.8 T_eq.

So,

87,906 = 1363.8 T_eq - 2160

Now, add 2160 to both sides:

87,906 + 2160 = 1363.8 T_eq → 89,  let's calculate 87,906 + 2160.

87,906 + 2000 is 89,906, then +160 gives 90,066. So:

90,066 = 1363.8 T_eq

Now, solve for T_eq: divide both sides by 1363.8.

T_eq = 90,066 / 1363.8 ≈ Let me compute that.

I can approximate 1363.8 as 1364 for easier division. So 90,066 ÷ 1364.

Hmm, 1364 * 66 = let's see: 1364*60=81,840. 1364*6=8,184. So 66*1364=81,840 +8,184= 89,  81,840 +8,184= 89,  (81k +8k is 89k?), Wait, 81,840 +8,184 = 89,  81,840 +8,184 is 89, 1, 840 +184=2024. Oh wait, 81,840 +8,184 = 89,  840+184=1024? Wait, maybe I should do it differently.

Wait, maybe I can calculate 90,066 ÷ 1363.8.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute this step by step.

Let me try 1363.8 * 66 = ?

1363.8 *60 = 81,828.

1363.8 *6=8,182.8.

Adding: 81,828 +8,182.8 = 89,  81,828 +8,182.8= 89,  the sum is 89,  81,828 plus 8,182.8 is 89,  (81,828 +8,182.8= 89,  let's do 81,828 +8,182.8= 89, 81,828 +8,000=89,828, plus 182.8: 89,828 +182.8= 89, 828 +182.8= 1010.8? Wait, no, that's not right. Let me add 81,828 +8,182.8 correctly.

81,828
+8,182.8
= 81,828 +8,000=89,828
+ 182.8 → 89,828 +182.8 = 90,010.8

So 1363.8 *66= 89,828 +182.8 → 90,010.8? Wait, no, that can't be correct because 1363.8 *66 is 1363.8*60 +1363.8*6 → 81,828 +8,182.8 = 90,010.8. So 66 gives 90,010.8, which is just 90,010.8. Our numerator is 90,066.

So 90,066 -90,010.8=55.2. So 55.2 is the remaining. So 55.2 ÷1363.8 ≈0.04046.

So T_eq ≈66 +0.04046≈66.04°C. But that's not one of the options. Wait, the options are given as A to J, let me check: the options are A:70, B:62, C:55, D:75, E:58, F:50, G:60, H:68, I:66, J:65. So I is 66, which is close to my calculation of ~66.04°C. But wait, let me check my calculations again because maybe I made an error.

Wait, in the equation after moving all terms, I had:

87,906 -1255.8 T_eq =108 T_eq -2160.

I should bring all terms to the left. Let me rearrange this correctly.

Wait, no, when I moved 1255.8 T_eq to the right by adding, I think I may have made a mistake in the signs.

Wait, let's go back to the equation:

1255.8*(70 - T_eq) = 108*(T_eq -20)

Expanding both:

1255.8*70 -1255.8 T_eq = 108 T_eq - 108*20

Which is:

87,906 -1255.8 T_eq =108 T_eq -2160

Now, to collect like terms, I can move all T_eq terms to the left and constants to the right.

So, add 1255.8 T_eq to both sides:

87,906 = 108 T_eq +1255.8 T_eq -2160

Which is:

87,906 = (108+1255.8) T_eq -2160 → 87,906 =1363.8 T_eq -2160

Now, add 2160 to both sides:

87,906 +2160 =1363.8 T_eq → 90,066 =1363.8 T_eq

So T_eq=90,066 /1363.8

Let me compute this more accurately.

Compute 90,066 ÷1363.8.

Let me try 1363.8 × 66 = ?

As before, 1363.8 ×60 =81,828.

1363.8 ×6=8,182.8.

Adding gives 81,828 +8,182.8=90,010.8.

Now, 90,066 -90,010.8=55.2.

So 55.2 ÷1363.8 ≈0.04046.

So T_eq≈66 +0.04046≈66.04°C.

Looking at the options, I see option I is 66.0. So the answer should be I.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the initial setup.

Alternatively, perhaps I should represent the equation as:

m1 c1 (T1_initial - T_eq) = m2 c2 (T_eq - T2_initial)

Which is correct because the heat lost by coffee (m1 c1 (T1 - T_eq)) equals heat gained by cup (m2 c2 (T_eq - T2)).

So that part is correct.

Let me plug in the numbers again to confirm.

m1=0.300 kg, c1=4186 J/kg°C, T1=70.

m2=0.120 kg, c2=900 J/kg°C, T2=20.

So,

0.300 *4186*(70 - T_eq) = 0.120 *900*(T_eq -20)

Which is:

1255.8*(70 - T_eq) = 108*(T_eq -20)

Yes, that's correct.

Then 1255.8*70=87,906, so 87,906 -1255.8 T_eq = 108 T_eq -2160.

Bring like terms together:

87,906 +2160 =108 T_eq +1255.8 T_eq → 90,066=1363.8 T_eq → T_eq=90,066/1363.8≈66.04°C.

So the closest option is I:66.0.
</think>

The equilibrium temperature is calculated by equating the heat lost by the coffee to the heat gained by the aluminum cup using the formula \( Q = mc\Delta T \). After solving the equation, the equilibrium temperature is approximately **66.0°C**, which corresponds to option I.
