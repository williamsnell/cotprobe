Okay, so I need to figure out which of the options A to D Leopold would clearly accept. I remember that Aldo Leopold is known for his work in conservation and his ethical views on nature. His famous quote about the land ethic comes to mind, where he talks about treating the land as a community of life.

Let's look at each option one by one.

Option A says that the problems with how we use the environment are about how humans should treat each other. That seems a bit off because Leopold's focus was more on the intrinsic value of nature and the land, not just the human-to-human aspect. He emphasized treating the land as a community, so I'm not sure if A is correct.

Option B suggests thinking in terms of "the balance of nature." Leopold did talk about the balance of nature, but he also warned against viewing it as a fixed state. He believed in a dynamic balance and that human actions could disrupt this balance. So while B might have some truth, I'm not certain if he would accept it without qualification.

Option C states that environmental problems aren't just economic. Leopold definitely argued against viewing nature purely through an economic lens. He believed that the land has inherent value beyond economics, so C seems correct. He criticized the idea that the environment can be valued solely based on its utility to humans.

Option D says to ignore all economic motives in land use decisions. Leopold wasn't against considering economics entirely, but he argued against letting economics be the sole consideration. He wanted a more holistic approach that includes ethical and ecological considerations. So D might be too extreme for him; he probably wouldn't agree with ignoring economics completely.

So, putting it together, Option C seems to align best with Leopold's views because he emphasized that environmental issues go beyond economics and require a deeper ethical understanding.
