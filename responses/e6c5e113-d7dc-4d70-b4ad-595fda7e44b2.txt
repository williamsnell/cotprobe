Question:

How will the cross elasticity of demand differ, depending upon whether product A is a complement of or substitute for product B?

Options:

A: The cross elasticity of demand for A with respect to the price of B will be positive only if both goods are luxury items.
B: The cross elasticity of demand for A will be infinite if good B's price changes.
C: The cross elasticity of demand for A with respect to the price of B will be zero
D: The cross elasticity of demand for A with respect to the price of B will always be positive
E: The cross elasticity of demand for A with respect to the price of B will be positive if A is a normal good and B is an inferior good.
F: If good A is a complement of good B, the cross elasticity of demand for A with respect to the price of B will be negative. If good A is a substitute for good B, the cross elasticity of demand for A with respect to the price of B will be positive.
G: The cross elasticity of demand for A with respect to the price of B will be positive if A and B are unrelated goods.
H: The cross elasticity of demand for A with respect to the price of B will be the same regardless of whether A is a complement or substitute for B.
I: The cross elasticity of demand for A with respect to the price of B will always be negative
J: If good A is a complement of good B, the cross elasticity of demand for A with respect to the price of B will be positive. If good A is a substitute for good B, the cross elasticity of demand for A with respect to the price of B will be negative.

Okay, so I've got this question about cross elasticity of demand, and I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what cross elasticity of demand means. From what I remember, cross elasticity of demand measures how the quantity demanded of one good responds to a change in the price of another good. The formula is something like the percentage change in quantity demanded of good A divided by the percentage change in the price of good B.

Now, the question is asking how the cross elasticity of demand will differ depending on whether product A is a complement or a substitute for product B. So I need to remember the difference between complements and substitutes.

Substitutes are goods that can be used in place of each other. For example, if the price of tea goes up, people might buy more coffee. So in this case, tea and coffee are substitutes. On the other hand, complements are goods that are used together. Like coffee and sugar; if the price of coffee goes up, people might buy less sugar because they drink less coffee.

So, thinking about cross elasticity, if A is a substitute for B, what happens when B's price changes? If B's price increases, people will buy less B, and since A is a substitute, they'll buy more A. So the demand for A increases when B's price increases. That means the cross elasticity is positive because quantity demanded of A increases as price of B increases.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, cross elasticity is E_A,B = (%ΔQ_A) / (%ΔP_B). So if P_B increases, Q_A increases (since A is a substitute), so the percentage change in Q_A is positive, and the percentage change in P_B is positive, so E_A,B is positive.

If A is a complement to B, then when P_B increases, Q_A would decrease because if B is more expensive, people buy less of it and since A is a complement, they might buy less A as well. So the percentage change in Q_A is negative, and P_B increased, so E_A,B is negative. So cross elasticity is negative.

So now, looking at the options:

Option F says: If A is a complement, cross elasticity is negative. If A is a substitute, cross elasticity is positive. That matches what I just thought. So F seems correct.

Option J says the opposite: If A is a complement, cross elasticity is positive, and if a substitute, negative. That's the opposite of what I concluded, so J is wrong.

Looking at the other options:

Option A talks about both being luxury items, which I don't think is relevant here. It's about the relationship between A and B, not their types.

Option B says cross elasticity is infinite if B's price changes. That doesn't make sense. Infinite would mean that any change in B's price leads to an infinite change in A's quantity, which isn't realistic.

Option C says cross elasticity is zero. That would mean no relationship, but the question is about whether they're complements or substitutes, so cross elasticity shouldn't be zero.

Option D says it's always positive. But that's not true because complements would have negative cross elasticity.

Option E talks about A being a normal good and B inferior. I don't think that's directly relevant to the cross elasticity in this context. It's more about individual goods' demand based on income, not cross.

Option G says cross elasticity is positive if they're unrelated. That could be true, but the question is about complements and substitutes, so G isn't the right answer.

Option H says cross elasticity is the same regardless. No, because substitutes and complements have opposite signs.

Option I says it's always negative. No, because substitutes would have positive.

So the correct answer should be F.

The cross elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of one good to a change in the price of another good. If product A is a substitute for product B, an increase in B's price leads to an increase in A's demand, resulting in a positive cross elasticity. Conversely, if A is a complement of B, an increase in B's price leads to a decrease in A's demand, resulting in a negative cross elasticity. Therefore, the cross elasticity of demand is positive for substitutes and negative for complements.
