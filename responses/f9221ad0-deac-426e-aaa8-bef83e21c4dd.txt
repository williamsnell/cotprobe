Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about machine learning concepts. Let's break it down step by step. 

The question has two statements, and I need to determine if each is true or false. Then, select the correct option from A to D based on that.

**Statement 1:** The training error of a 1-nearest neighbor classifier is 0.

Okay, I remember that a 1-nearest neighbor (1-NN) classifier works by finding the closest training example to a new query and classifying it based on that single neighbor. Since it's using the training data directly, for all the training examples themselves, the classifier will always correctly classify them. Because when you query a training point, the nearest neighbor is itself, so the prediction is correct. Therefore, the training error must be zero. So Statement 1 is True.

**Statement 2:** As the number of data points grows to infinity, the MAP estimate approaches the MLE estimate for all possible priors. In other words, given enough data, the choice of prior is irrelevant.

Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I know that Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation is like MLE but incorporates prior knowledge through Bayes' theorem. The formula for MAP is proportional to the likelihood times the prior. 

In the limit as the number of data points (n) approaches infinity, the influence of the prior should diminish because the likelihood term dominates. So, for any prior, regardless of what it is, as n becomes very large, the MAP estimate should get closer to the MLE estimate. 

Wait, but does this hold for all possible priors? Let me think. If the prior is improper or if it's a very strong prior, would that still hold? Even with a strong prior, when n is large, the data should outweigh the prior. So, yes, in the limit, MAP should approach MLE regardless of the prior. 

Wait, no. I think that's only true if the prior is proper and the model is well-behaved. But in theory, as n grows, the prior's influence becomes negligible. So Statement 2 is True.

Wait, but I've heard that sometimes the choice of prior can matter even asymptotically. No, no, I think that's not the case. Because as n→infty, the posterior is dominated by the likelihood. So the prior's effect becomes insignificant. So, even with a weird prior, as data grows, the MAP will approach MLE. So Statement 2 is True.

Wait, but the statement says "for all possible priors." Are there any priors where this doesn't hold? Like if the prior is completely flat, it's the same as MLE. If the prior is informative, but as data grows, it should still be overwhelmed. So yes, Statement 2 is True.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. Suppose the prior is a point mass at some value different from the MLE. Then, as n increases, the MLE would approach the true parameter, but the MAP would be stuck at the prior's point. But wait, no—if the prior is a point mass, then the posterior would also be a point mass at that same value, regardless of the data. Because the prior has zero probability elsewhere. So in that case, the MAP estimate would not approach the MLE, because it's fixed by the prior. 

Oh, that's a problem. So if the prior is a point mass, the MAP estimate remains at that point, regardless of data. So in that case, the MAP would not approach MLE as n increases. Therefore, Statement 2 is False because it doesn't hold for all possible priors—specifically, priors that are concentrated at a single point.

Wait, but the statement says "for all possible priors." So if there's any prior where it doesn't hold, then the statement is False. Since a point mass prior is a possible prior, and in that case, MAP doesn't approach MLE, Statement 2 is False.

Wait, but I'm confused again. Because in reality, when the prior is a point mass, the posterior is also a point mass at that value. So the MAP estimate would always be that point, regardless of data. So if the true parameter is elsewhere, the MLE would approach the true parameter, but the MAP would stay fixed. Therefore, in such a case, the MAP doesn't approach MLE as n increases. So yes, Statement 2 is False.

So putting it together:

Statement 1: True

Statement 2: False

So looking at the options:

A: True, True → No, because S2 is False.

B: False, True → No, S1 is True.

C: False, False → No, S1 is True.

D: True, False → Yes, that's correct.

So the correct answer is D.
</think>

The first statement is true because a 1-nearest neighbor classifier correctly classifies all training examples, resulting in zero training error. The second statement is false because, for certain priors (like point masses), the MAP estimate does not approach the MLE as the data size grows. 

Answer: D
