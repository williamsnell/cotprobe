Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Reiman and van den Haag's arguments regarding the death penalty. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I need to remember what each philosopher's stance was. From what I recall, van den Haag was a proponent of the death penalty. He argued in favor of it, probably from a retributive perspective, meaning that punishment should fit the crime. So, he might have believed that the death penalty is just because the crime was murder, and the punishment should match that.

Now, Reiman is the other philosopher here. I think Reiman critiqued van den Haag's arguments. Reiman might have pointed out some flaws in van den Haag's reasoning, perhaps arguing against the death penalty.

The question is asking what conclusion Reiman thought van den Haag's argument leads to. So, Reiman is evaluating van den Haag's position and thinks it leads to a particular conclusion.

Looking at the options:

A: Refrain from imposing the death penalty. That would mean Reiman thinks van den Haag's argument is flawed and leads to opposing the death penalty, but I'm not sure.

B: Death penalty is a necessary evil. That seems more like a common argument, but I'm not sure if Reiman would say van den Haag's argument leads here.

C: Murder is wrong. Well, that's a given, but the question is about the conclusion regarding the death penalty.

D: institute death by torture. That seems extreme and probably not the conclusion Reiman would think van den Haag leads to.

E: capital punishment serves as a deterrent. Van den Haag might have discussed deterrence, but I'm not sure if that's the main point Reiman was addressing.

F: society should be more lenient. Unlikely, since van den Haag was in favor, so Reiman might see it as leading to a harsher stance.

G: abolish all forms of punishment. That seems too broad; probably not the conclusion.

H: death penalty is ultimate justice. That sounds more like van den Haag's position, but Reiman would critique that.

I: give criminals a chance to reform. Maybe, but I think Reiman's critique was more about the morality or justice of the death penalty itself.

J: refusal to execute has a civilizing effect. That rings a bell. I think Reiman argued that the abolition of the death penalty actually shows progress in society's moral development. So, if van den Haag's argument leads to thinking that executing is necessary, Reiman would counter that the refusal (abolishing) shows we're civilized.

Wait, the question is about what Reiman thinks van den Haag's argument leads to. So Reiman is pointing out that van den Haag's reasoning, if followed, would mean that society should execute more people, but Reiman argues that this actually shows a lack of civilization. Therefore, the conclusion Reiman attributes to van den Haag is that the refusal to execute (abolishing the death penalty) is uncivilized, hence the opposite—that executing is necessary—would be the conclusion. But looking at the options, J says "the refusal to execute has a civilizing effect." So if Reiman is saying that van den Haag's argument leads to thinking that not executing is uncivilized, then the opposite would be that executing is a sign of civilization. But the options don't have that. Instead, option J says refusal has a civilizing effect, which would be Reiman's view, not van den Haag's.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me rephrase. Van den Haag supports the death penalty. Reiman criticizes him. Reiman might argue that van den Haag's position leads to a conclusion that if we don't execute, it's uncivilized. So Reiman would then counter that the refusal to execute is actually a sign of a more civilized society. Therefore, the conclusion Reiman thinks van den Haag's argument leads to is that if we don't execute, it's uncivilized, but Reiman would say that the refusal is actually civilizing. So the answer would be J, because Reiman is pointing out that van den Haag's argument implies that not executing is uncivilizing, but in reality, the refusal is a positive thing.

Alternatively, perhaps Reiman argues that van den Haag's position leads to the conclusion that society should execute more, which would be a more barbaric approach, and thus the refusal is better, hence J.

So I think the correct answer is J: the refusal to execute criminals has a civilizing effect. Because Reiman would argue that van den Haag's stance, if taken to its logical conclusion, implies that not executing is uncivilized, but Reiman would counter that the refusal is actually a sign of progress and civilization.
