Okay, so I need to find the determinant of matrix A, which is a 3x3 matrix. The matrix A is given as [[2, 4, 3], [3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 5]]. Hmm, I remember that the determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated using the rule of Sarrus or the cofactor expansion method. I'm more comfortable with the cofactor expansion, so I'll go with that.

First, let me write down the matrix again to visualize it better:

A = [
    [2, 4, 3],
    [3, 0, 1],
    [1, 2, 5]
]

The formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix is:

det(A) = a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg)

Where the matrix is:

[a, b, c]
[d, e, f]
[g, h, i]

Wait, let me make sure I'm assigning the letters correctly. So, the first row is a, b, c which is 2,4,3. The second row is d,e,f which is 3,0,1. The third row is g,h,i which is 1,2,5.

So, substituting the values:

det(A) = 2*(0*5 - 1*2) - 4*(3*5 - 1*1) + 3*(3*2 - 0*1)

Let me compute each part step by step.

First part: 2*(0*5 - 1*2) = 2*(0 - 2) = 2*(-2) = -4

Second part: -4*(3*5 - 1*1) = -4*(15 - 1) = -4*(14) = -56

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake here. The formula is a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg). So the second term is subtracting b times (di - fg). So di is 3*5=15, fg is 1*1=1. So 15 -1 =14. Then multiply by -4, so it's -4*14 = -56.

Third part: +3*(3*2 - 0*1) = 3*(6 - 0) = 3*6 = 18.

Now, adding all three parts together: -4 -56 +18.

Let me calculate that: (-4 -56) = -60, then +18 gives -42.

Hmm, so the determinant is -42. Looking at the options, that's option G.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First term: 2*(0*5 -1*2) = 2*(0-2)=2*(-2)=-4. Correct.

Second term: -4*(3*5 -1*1)= -4*(15-1)=-4*14=-56. Correct.

Third term: 3*(3*2 -0*1)=3*(6-0)=18. Correct.

Adding: -4 -56 is -60, plus 18 is -42. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, another way to compute it is using the rule of Sarrus. Let me try that method to confirm.

Copy the first two columns next to the matrix:

2 4 3 | 2 4
3 0 1 |3 0
1 2 5 |1 2

Now, the determinant is the sum of the products of the diagonals going from top to bottom minus the sum of the products of the diagonals going from bottom to top.

So, the main diagonals:

2*0*5 = 0
4*1*1 = 4
3*3*2 = 18
Sum of these: 0 +4 +18=22

Now the other diagonals:

3*0*1=0
1*4*1=4
5*3*2=30
Sum: 0 +4 +30=34

Then determinant is 22 -34= -12. Wait, that's different from before. Oh wait, I must have made a mistake in the Sarrus method.

Wait, no, maybe I'm not applying it correctly. Let me check the rule again. The rule of Sarrus says you multiply the three main diagonals (from top left to bottom right) and subtract the product of the other three diagonals (from top right to bottom left).

Wait, perhaps I have the diagonals wrong. Let me list them properly.

The main diagonals (top left to bottom right) are:

2*0*5 = 0

4*1*1 =4 (Wait, no, that's not a main diagonal. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing it up.

Wait, maybe I should number the positions correctly.

In the Sarrus method, for a 3x3 matrix:

[a, b, c]
[d, e, f]
[g, h, i]

You write the matrix twice, side by side:

a b c | a b c
d e f | d e f
g h i | g h i

Then, the determinant is calculated as:

(a*e*i) + (b*f*g) + (c*d*h) - (c*e*g) - (b*d*i) - (a*f*h)

Wait, let me compute each term.

a=2, e=0, i=5 → 2*0*5=0

b=4, f=1, g=1 →4*1*1=4

c=3, d=3, h=2 →3*3*2=18

Now subtract:

c*e*g=3*0*1=0

b*d*i=4*3*5=60

a*f*h=2*1*2=4

So determinant = (0 +4 +18) - (0 +60 +4) → 22 -64= -42.

Ah, that's the same as before. So the determinant is -42. So option G is correct.

The determinant of matrix A is calculated using the cofactor expansion method, resulting in -42. This is confirmed by the rule of Sarrus as well.
