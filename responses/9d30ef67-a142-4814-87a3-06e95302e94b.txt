Question:

Construct a complete truth table for the following argument. Then, using the truth table, determine whether the argument is valid or invalid. If the argument is invalid, choose an option which presents a counterexample. (There may be other counterexamples as well.)
I ≡ ~J
I ∨ J / I

Options:

A: Valid. The argument is a contradiction
B: Invalid. Counterexample when I and J are true
C: Valid
D: Invalid. Counterexample when both I and J are false
E: Valid. The argument is tautological
F: Invalid. Counterexample when I is true and J is false
G: Invalid. Counterexample when I is false and J is true
H: Invalid. Counterexample when J is true and I is false
I: Invalid. Counterexample when I is false and J is false
J: Valid. No counterexample exists

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this logical argument is valid or invalid. The argument given is:

I ≡ ~J
I ∨ J / I

Okay, let's break this down. First, I remember that a truth table is a good way to check the validity of an argument. So I'll need to construct one for the propositions I and J.

The argument has two premises: I is equivalent to not J (I ≡ ~J), and I or J (I ∨ J). The conclusion is I.

First, I need to list all possible truth values for I and J. Since there are two variables, there are four combinations: both true, both false, I true and J false, and I false and J true.

So, let's set up the truth table:

I | J | ~J | I ≡ ~J | I ∨ J | Conclusion (I)
---|----|----|--------|-------|------------
T | T | F  | F      | T     | T
T | F | T  | T      | T     | T
F | T | F  | T      | T     | F
F | F | T  | F      | F     | F

Wait, let me go through each step carefully. For each row, I'll compute each part.

1. When I=T and J=T:
   - ~J is F.
   - I ≡ ~J becomes T ≡ F, which is F.
   - I ∨ J is T ∨ T, which is T.
   - Conclusion I is T.
   So the premises are F and T, so the premises are not both true here. So the argument doesn't need to hold in this case.

2. When I=T and J=F:
   - ~J is T.
   - I ≡ ~J is T ≡ T, which is T.
   - I ∨ J is T ∨ F, which is T.
   - Conclusion I is T.
   Here, both premises are true (T and T), so the conclusion must be true. It is, so this row is fine.

3. When I=F and J=T:
   - ~J is F.
   - I ≡ ~J is F ≡ F, which is T.
   - I ∨ J is F ∨ T, which is T.
   - Conclusion I is F.
   Now, both premises are true (T and T), but the conclusion is F. This means the argument is invalid because there's a case where premises are true but conclusion is false.

4. When I=F and J=F:
   - ~J is T.
   - I ≡ ~J is F ≡ T, which is F.
   - I ∨ J is F ∨ F, which is F.
   - Conclusion I is F.
   Here, the premises are F and F, so the argument doesn't need to hold.

So from the truth table, the argument is invalid because in the third row, when I=F and J=T, the premises are both true, but the conclusion is false. That's a counterexample.

Now, looking at the options, I need to find which one matches this scenario.

Option D says: Invalid. Counterexample when both I and J are false. Wait, no, in the case I=F and J=T, both aren't false. So D is when both are false, which isn't the case here.

Option F is: Invalid. Counterexample when I is true and J is false. No, that's the second row where the argument holds.

Option G is: Invalid. Counterexample when I is false and J is true. Yes, that's exactly the third row where I=F and J=T, making the premises true and conclusion false.

Option H is: Invalid. Counterexample when J is true and I is false. That's the same as G, just phrased differently. So both G and H are correct in that case.

Wait, let me check the options again. The options are labeled A to J.

Looking back, the options are:

A: Valid. The argument is a contradiction
B: Invalid. Counterexample when I and J are true
C: Valid
D: Invalid. Counterexample when both I and J are false
E: Valid. The argument is tautological
F: Invalid. Counterexample when I is true and J is false
G: Invalid. Counterexample when I is false and J is true
H: Invalid. Counterexample when J is true and I is false
I: Invalid. Counterexample when I is false and J is false
J: Valid. No counterexample exists

So, the counterexample occurs when I is false and J is true, which is both G and H. Wait, G says when I is false and J is true, which is exactly the third row. H says when J is true and I is false, which is the same as G.

Wait, but in the options, G and H are different. Let me check the wording.

G: Invalid. Counterexample when I is false and J is true.

H: Invalid. Counterexample when J is true and I is false.

These are the same scenarios, just the order is different. So both G and H are correct. But looking back at how the options are presented, perhaps only one is listed as correct.

Wait, but the options are from A to J, each being a single choice. So the correct answer is the one that correctly identifies the counterexample when I is false and J is true.

So the correct answer would be either G or H, but they are slightly different. Let me check the exact wording again.

Option G: when I is false and J is true.

Option H: when J is true and I is false.

Both are correct, but in the options, perhaps only one is present. Wait, looking back, perhaps only one of them is an option. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, G is "Invalid. Counterexample when I is false and J is true." H is "Invalid. Counterexample when J is true and I is false."

So both are correct, but perhaps only one is listed as an option. Wait, but in the options provided, both G and H are present. That can't be right because the user must have intended one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the truth table. Let me double-check.

In the third row, I is F, J is T.

Premise 1: I ≡ ~J. So I is F, ~J is F (since J is T). So F ≡ F is T.

Premise 2: I ∨ J is F ∨ T, which is T.

Conclusion: I is F.

So the premises are both T, conclusion F. So this is a counterexample.

So the counterexample is when I is F and J is T, which is the same as J is T and I is F.

So both G and H describe the same scenario, just phrased differently.

But in the options, perhaps only one is correct. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

G: Invalid. Counterexample when I is false and J is true.

H: Invalid. Counterexample when J is true and I is false.

So both options are correct, but perhaps only one is provided as an option. Wait, the user must have intended one correct answer. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is G, as it's listed before H.

But wait, in the options, H is "Invalid. Counterexample when J is true and I is false." Which is the same as G.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is both G and H, but since the options are separate, maybe the intended answer is G.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the truth table. Let me re-examine.

Wait, in the third row: I=F, J=T.

Premise 1: I ≡ ~J → F ≡ ~T → F ≡ F → T.

Premise 2: I ∨ J → F ∨ T → T.

Conclusion: I → F.

So the premises are true, conclusion is false. So this is a counterexample.

So the correct answer is that the argument is invalid, and the counterexample is when I is false and J is true, which is option G.

Alternatively, if H says the same but in a different order, perhaps both are correct, but since only one can be chosen, perhaps the intended answer is G.

Wait, but looking again, the options are A through J, each with a unique statement. So perhaps the intended answer is G.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is H, as it's phrased differently.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is G, because it states I is false and J is true, which is the same as when I is false and J is true.

So, the answer should be G.

The argument is invalid because there's a counterexample where I is false and J is true.
