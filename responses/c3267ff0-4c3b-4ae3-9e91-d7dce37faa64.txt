Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out how much work is done when a mass of 150 kilograms is dragged 10 meters with a coefficient of sliding friction of 0.30. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about work and friction.

Work is generally calculated as force multiplied by distance, right? But wait, there are a few things to consider here. The problem mentions sliding friction, which is the type of friction that occurs when two surfaces are sliding past each other. So, I think the formula for frictional force is friction = coefficient of friction multiplied by the normal force.

The normal force, in this case, should be equal to the weight of the mass because the object is on a horizontal surface, I assume. Wait, the problem doesn't specify the surface, but I think it's safe to assume it's horizontal since it's talking about dragging. So, the normal force (N) is mass times gravity. Gravity is approximately 9.8 m/s².

Let me jot down the given values:
- Mass (m) = 150 kg
- Distance (d) = 10 m
- Coefficient of sliding friction (μ) = 0.30
- Gravity (g) = 9.8 m/s²

First, calculate the normal force:
N = m * g = 150 kg * 9.8 m/s²
Let me do that math: 150 times 9 is 1350, and 150 times 0.8 is 120. So 1350 + 120 = 1470. So, N = 1470 N.

Now, frictional force (F_f) is μ times N:
F_f = μ * N = 0.30 * 1470 N
Calculating that: 0.3 * 1470. Let's see, 1470 divided by 10 is 147, so 0.3 is 30% of that. 147 * 3 = 441. So F_f = 441 N.

Wait, but work is force times distance, but I need to make sure the force is in the direction of motion. Since the object is being dragged, the friction is opposing the motion. But work done by friction would be negative if we're considering the force opposing the displacement. However, the question is asking how much work is done when dragging, so I think we're considering the work done against friction, which would be positive. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the work done by the force applied, which would require overcoming friction. But maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's proceed.

Work (W) = F * d * cos(theta), where theta is the angle between the force and displacement. Since the force is applied in the same direction as displacement, cos(0) is 1, so W = F * d.

But wait, in this case, the force we're considering is the frictional force because the question is about the work done when the mass is dragged. No, wait, no. The work done by the friction force would be against the motion, but the work done by the applied force would be positive. Alternatively, the question might be asking for the work done against friction, which would be the same as the work done by the applied force.

Wait, the problem says "how much work is done when a mass is dragged", which implies the work done by the agent applying the force, which is overcoming friction. So, the work done would be the same as the work done by friction, but positive because it's the work done against it.

So, W = F_f * d. Wait, but no, because the applied force must be equal to the frictional force to maintain constant velocity, but if the mass is accelerating, then the applied force would be more. But the problem doesn't specify acceleration, so I think we can assume it's moving at constant velocity, so F_applied = F_f.

So, work done by the applied force is F_applied * d = F_f * d = 441 N * 10 m.

Calculating that: 441 * 10 = 4410 J.

Looking back at the options, option I is 4410 joules. So, the answer should be I.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I make any mistakes in the calculations? Let me recalculate the frictional force. 150 kg * 9.8 = 1470 N. 1470 * 0.3 = 441 N. Then 441 * 10 = 4410 J. Yes, that seems correct. So the answer is I.

The work done is calculated by multiplying the frictional force by the distance dragged. The frictional force is determined using the coefficient of sliding friction and the normal force, which equals the weight of the mass. After calculations, the work done is 4410 joules.
