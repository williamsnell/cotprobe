Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the weight percent of a NaOH solution. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says that the solution is 2.56 M NaOH, and the density is about 1.10 g/mL. I need to find out what weight percent this corresponds to, and then choose the correct option from A to J.

First, I remember that molarity (M) is moles of solute per liter of solution. So, I can start by finding the number of moles in one liter of the solution.

The formula weight (molar mass) of NaOH is given as 40.0 g/mol. That's helpful because I can use it to convert moles to grams.

So, for a 2.56 M solution, in one liter (which is 1000 mL), there are 2.56 moles of NaOH. To find the mass of NaOH in grams, I multiply moles by the molar mass:

2.56 moles * 40.0 g/mol = 102.4 grams of NaOH in 1000 mL (which is 1 kg) of solution.

Wait, no. Wait a second. Because 1 liter of solution doesn't weigh exactly 1000 grams unless the density is 1 g/mL. Oh right, the density here is 1.10 g/mL. So, the mass of 1 liter (1000 mL) of the solution would be density multiplied by volume. So:

Density = 1.10 g/mL * volume in mL. So for 1000 mL, the mass is 1.10 * 1000 = 1100 grams, or 1.10 kg.

So the solution's mass is 1100 grams per liter. Now, in that 1100 grams, there are 102.4 grams of NaOH.

The weight percent is (mass of NaOH / total mass of solution) * 100%. So that's (102.4 g / 1100 g) * 100.

Let me calculate that. 102.4 divided by 1100. Hmm, 102.4 / 1100 = approximately 0.09309. Multiply by 100% gives about 9.309%.

Wait, but looking at the options, J is 9.3%. So that would be the answer. But let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake.

Wait, let me check again: 2.56 M means 2.56 moles per liter. Molar mass of NaOH is 40 g/mol, so moles * molar mass = 2.56 *40 = 102.4 g in one liter.

But one liter is 1000 mL, so the mass of the solution is density * volume: 1.10 g/mL * 1000 mL = 1100 grams.

So the weight percent is (102.4 / 1100) *100 = (102.4 / 11) *1 = 9.309%, which rounds to 9.3%. So the correct answer should be J.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem says the solution must be at least 10% NaOH by weight. But according to my calculation, it's about 9.3%, which is below 10%. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Let me see: Did I calculate the mass of the solution correctly? 1.10 g/mL * 1000 mL = 1100 grams. That seems right.

NaOH mass: 2.56 moles * 40 g/mol = 102.4 grams. That also seems correct.

So 102.4 /1100 = 0.09309, which is 9.309%. So answer J.

Wait, but maybe I should check if the formula weight is 40 g/mol. Let me confirm: Na is about 23, O is 16, H is 1. So 23 +16 +1 =40. Yeah, correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the solution's mass differently. Maybe I should calculate it using a different approach, like using the molarity formula with density and weight percent.

Another approach: Molarity (M) = (10 * density * weight percent) / (molar mass + (10 - weight percent)*density).

Wait, I'm not sure about that formula. Alternatively, the formula for converting between weight percent and molarity is a bit more complex.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula:

Molarity = (10 * density * w/w%) / (molar mass + (10 - w/w%) * density )

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's better to stick with the initial approach I took because it seems straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach because when you have a solution with a certain density, the volume in liters doesn't directly translate to 1000 grams. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The solution's mass is correctly calculated as 1.10 g/mL * 1000 mL = 1100 grams. So the calculation should be correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is J:9.3%. That's one of the options, so I think I'm confident with that.

To determine the weight percent of a 2.56 M NaOH solution with a density of 1.10 g/mL, we start by calculating the mass of NaOH in one liter of the solution. Since 1 M = 1 mole/L, 2.56 moles of NaOH are present in 1 L (1000 mL) of the solution. Using the molar mass of NaOH (40.0 g/mol), the mass of NaOH is:

\[
2.56 \, \text{moles} \times 40.0 \, \text{g/mol} = 102.4 \, \text{g}
\]

Next, we calculate the total mass of the solution. The density of the solution is 1.10 g/mL, so the mass of 1000 mL of the solution is:

\[
1.10 \, \text{g/mL} \times 1000 \, \text{mL} = 1100 \, \text{g}
\]

The weight percent of NaOH in the solution is then:

\[
\text{Weight percent} = \left( \frac{\text{Mass of NaOH}}{\text{Total mass of solution}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{102.4 \, \text{g}}{1100 \, \text{g}} \right) \times 100 \approx 9.3\%
\]

Thus, the weight percent of the solution corresponds to option J.
