Okay, so I've got this question about buying a bicycle on an installment plan. Let me see if I can figure this out. Hmm, the bike costs $82, and you can buy it without a down payment, but there's a 10% per year finance charge. The payments are monthly, and the plan is for six months. I need to find out how much each monthly payment should be to pay off the bike in six months.

Alright, first, let me understand the problem. The finance charge is 10% per year. Since the payments are monthly, I think I need to calculate the monthly interest rate. Wait, is it simple interest or compound interest? The question doesn't specify, but usually, for installment plans, it might be simple interest. Let me think. So, 10% per year is the interest rate, so the monthly rate would be 10% divided by 12 months. Let me calculate that.

10% per year is 0.10 in decimal. So, 0.10 divided by 12 is approximately 0.0083333 per month. So each month, the interest would be around 0.83333%.

Now, since the payments are made monthly, and the term is six months, I need to calculate the amount to be paid each month that will cover both the principal and the interest. This sounds like an annuity problem. The present value of an ordinary annuity formula might be useful here.

The present value (PV) is $82, the interest rate per period (i) is 0.0083333, and the number of periods (n) is 6. The formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is:

PV = PMT × [(1 - (1 + i)^-n) / i]

I need to solve for PMT, the monthly payment. Rearranging the formula:

PMT = PV / [(1 - (1 + i)^-n) / i]

Plugging in the numbers:

PV = 82
i = 0.10 / 12 ≈ 0.0083333
n = 6

Let me calculate (1 + i)^-n first. So, 1 + 0.0083333 is approximately 1.0083333. Raising that to the power of -6.

Calculating (1.0083333)^-6. Hmm, maybe I can use logarithms or just approximate it. Alternatively, I can use the formula step by step.

Wait, I think I can use the present value factor for an ordinary annuity. The factor is [(1 - (1 + i)^-n) / i]. Let me compute that.

First, compute (1 + i)^n. Wait, n is 6, so (1.0083333)^6. Let me calculate that. Let's see, 1.0083333^1 is 1.0083333, squared is about 1.01667, cubed is around 1.025, but maybe I should be more precise.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula step by step:

1.0083333^6 ≈ e^(6 * ln(1.0083333)).

But maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, I can use the rule of 78 or some approximation, but perhaps it's better to calculate directly.

Wait, maybe I can use the formula (1 + i)^n where i=0.0083333 and n=6.

Let me compute this:

(1.0083333)^6.

I'll compute step by step:

1.0083333^1 = 1.0083333

^2 = 1.0083333 * 1.0083333 ≈ 1.01667

^3 = 1.01667 * 1.0083333 ≈ 1.025

Wait, that's an approximation. Let me do it more accurately.

1.0083333^2 = (1 + 0.0083333)^2 = 1 + 2*0.0083333 + (0.0083333)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.0166666 + 0.00006944 ≈ 1.016736.

Then 1.016736 * 1.0083333 ≈ 1.016736 * 1.0083333.

Let me compute that:

1.016736 * 1 = 1.016736

1.016736 * 0.0083333 ≈ 0.0083333 * 1.016736 ≈ 0.0084395.

So total ≈ 1.016736 + 0.0084395 ≈ 1.0251755.

That's after 3 months.

Now, for the 4th month: 1.0251755 * 1.0083333 ≈ 1.0251755 * 1.0083333 ≈ let's compute:

1.0251755 * 1 = 1.0251755

1.0251755 * 0.0083333 ≈ 0.0084595.

Total ≈ 1.0251755 + 0.0084595 ≈ 1.033635.

5th month: 1.033635 * 1.0083333 ≈ 

1.033635 * 1 = 1.033635

1.033635 * 0.0083333 ≈ 0.0085145.

Total ≈ 1.033635 + 0.0085145 ≈ 1.0421495.

6th month: 1.0421495 * 1.0083333 ≈ 

1.0421495 * 1 = 1.0421495

1.0421495 * 0.0083333 ≈ 0.0086845.

Total ≈ 1.0421495 + 0.0086845 ≈ 1.050834.

So (1.0083333)^6 ≈ 1.050834.

Therefore, (1 + i)^-6 = 1 / 1.050834 ≈ 0.9518.

Now, compute 1 - (1 + i)^-6 = 1 - 0.9518 ≈ 0.0482.

Then, the annuity factor is 0.0482 / 0.0083333 ≈ 5.784.

So, PMT = 82 / 5.784 ≈ Let's calculate that.

82 ÷ 5.784 ≈ Let me see: 5.784 × 14 = 80.976 (since 5.784 ×10=57.84, ×4=23.136; total 80.976). So 14 would give 80.976, which is just under 82. So 82 ÷5.784 ≈ 14.15.

Wait, but that's approximately 14.15. Let me check more accurately.

5.784 × 14 = 80.976

82 - 80.976 = 1.024.

So 1.024 /5.784 ≈ 0.177.

So total PMT≈14 + 0.177≈14.177, about $14.18 per month.

Wait, but none of the options are exactly 14.18. The options are A:15.85, B:13.65, C:13.35, D:16.35, E:15.35, F:14.85, G:14.35, H:13.85, I:12.85, J:12.35.

Hmm, my calculation gave about $14.18, but the closest option is F:14.85 or G:14.35, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the interest calculation.

Wait, maybe I did the interest rate wrong. Let me double-check the interest calculation. The problem says a 10% per year finance charge, but is it simple interest or compound interest? If it's simple interest, then the total interest over the six months would be principal × rate × time.

So, simple interest: I = P × r × t.

P = $82, r=10% per year, so 0.10, t=6/12=0.5 years.

I =82 ×0.10 ×0.5=82 ×0.05= $4.10.

Total amount to pay would be 82 +4.10= $86.10.

Then, the monthly payment would be 86.10 /6=14.35. So that's $14.35, which is option G.

Wait, but earlier, when I used the annuity formula, I got around $14.18, but that's assuming compound interest. But perhaps the question is using simple interest instead. Let me see.

In installment plans, sometimes simple interest is used. So maybe I should recalculate using simple interest.

So, using simple interest: total interest is $4.10, total amount $86.10, so 86.10 divided by 6 months is 14.35. That matches option G.

But wait, the question says a 10% per year finance charge. So is that simple interest or is it an annual percentage rate (APR) that's compounded monthly? The problem doesn't specify, which is a bit ambiguous. However, in many installment plans, especially short-term ones like six months, simple interest is more common.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate simple interest. Let me confirm.

Simple interest: total interest = 82 ×0.10 × (6/12) =82 ×0.05=4.10. So total amount is 86.10, so each payment is 86.10 /6=14.35. So the answer is G:14.35.

Wait, but when I used the annuity formula with monthly compounding, I got about 14.18, which isn't an option. But when using simple interest, I get 14.35, which is option G. So maybe the correct answer is G.

Alternatively, perhaps the finance charge is calculated as compound interest, and I made a mistake in my earlier calculation.

Wait, let me try the annuity approach again, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

The present value of the annuity is 82, and we need to find PMT where:

82 = PMT × [ (1 - (1 + i)^-n ) / i ]

i = 0.10 /12 = 0.0083333, n=6.

Compute (1 + i)^-n = (1.0083333)^-6.

I think I approximated this as 0.9518 earlier, but perhaps a more accurate calculation is needed.

Let me compute (1.0083333)^6 accurately.

Using a calculator approach:

1.0083333^1 = 1.0083333

^2 = 1.0083333 *1.0083333 ≈1.01667 (as before)

^3 =1.01667 *1.0083333≈1.02517

^4≈1.02517 *1.0083333≈1.03374

^5≈1.03374 *1.0083333≈1.0423

^6≈1.0423 *1.0083333≈1.0509.

So (1.0083333)^6 ≈1.0509, so (1.0509)^-1≈0.9517.

So 1 - 0.9517=0.0483.

Then, 0.0483 / 0.0083333≈5.796.

So PMT=82 /5.796≈14.15.

Hmm, that's about $14.15, which is not one of the options. The options are G:14.35, F:14.85, etc.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise calculations.

Alternatively, maybe the question is using simple interest, which gives $14.35, option G.

Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me check the formula again.

The present value of an ordinary annuity is:

PV = PMT × [ (1 - (1 + i)^-n ) / i ]

So, PMT = PV / [ (1 - (1 + i)^-n ) / i ]

With PV=82, i=0.0083333, n=6.

Calculating the denominator: [ (1 - (1.0083333)^-6 ) / 0.0083333 ]

As before, (1.0083333)^6≈1.0509, so (1.0509)^-1≈0.9517.

So 1 - 0.9517=0.0483.

0.0483 /0.0083333≈5.796.

So PMT=82 /5.796≈14.15.

But the options don't have 14.15. The closest are G:14.35 and F:14.85.

Wait, perhaps the interest is calculated differently. Maybe the 10% is the APR, which is the annual percentage rate, and it's compounded monthly, but for six months, so the interest is calculated as 10% divided by 2 (since 6 months is half a year), which would be 5%.

So total interest would be 82 *5% =4.10, total amount 86.10, so 86.10 /6=14.35, which is option G.

Alternatively, perhaps the finance charge is 10% per annum simple interest, so it's 5% for six months, so total amount is 82 +4.10=86.10, so 86.10/6=14.35, which is G.

So the answer would be G:14.35.
</think>

To determine the monthly payment for purchasing the bicycle on installment, we consider the finance charge of 10% per year. Assuming simple interest, the total interest for six months is calculated as 10% of $82 for half a year, which is $4.10. The total amount to be paid is $82 + $4.10 = $86.10. Dividing this by six months gives a monthly payment of $14.35.
