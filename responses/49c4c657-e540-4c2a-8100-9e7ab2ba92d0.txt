Okay, so I have this statistics problem here. Let me try to understand what it's asking. The question is about finding a lower bound for the probability that the absolute difference between Y/n and 0.25 is less than 0.05. Y follows a binomial distribution with parameters n and p=0.25. Specifically, for part (b), n is 500.

Hmm, I remember that for binomial distributions, when n is large, we can approximate it using the normal distribution. The formula for the probability involves the mean and standard deviation. The mean of Y would be n*p, which in this case is 500*0.25 = 125. The variance would be n*p*(1-p), so that's 500*0.25*0.75 = 93.75. The standard deviation is the square root of that, which is sqrt(93.75) ≈ 9.682.

Wait, the problem is about Y/n, which is the sample proportion. So, we're looking at P(|Y/n - 0.25| < 0.05). That's the same as P(0.20 < Y/n < 0.30). To find this probability, I can use the normal approximation.

First, I'll standardize Y/n to a Z-score. The expected value of Y/n is p=0.25, and the standard error is sqrt(p*(1-p)/n). So, the standard error is sqrt(0.25*0.75 /500) = sqrt(0.1875/500) ≈ sqrt(0.000375) ≈ 0.01936.

Now, the event |Y/n -0.25| <0.05 translates to Y/n being within 0.05 of 0.25. So, the Z-scores for the lower and upper bounds are (0.20 - 0.25)/0.01936 ≈ -2.58 and (0.30 -0.25)/0.01936 ≈ 2.58. So, I'm looking for P(-2.58 < Z < 2.58).

I think the standard normal distribution tells me that P(Z < 2.58) is about 0.9951, so the probability between -2.58 and 2.58 is 0.9951 - (1 - 0.9951) = 0.9902. Wait, but that's the approximate probability using the normal approximation. But the question is asking for a lower bound. Hmm, so maybe I need a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe using Chebyshev's inequality. Chebyshev gives a bound on the probability that a random variable deviates from its mean. The formula is P(|X - μ| ≥ kσ) ≤ 1/k². But here, I want P(|Y/n - p| < ε) which is 1 - P(|Y/n - p| ≥ ε). So, using Chebyshev, P(|Y/n - p| ≥ ε) ≤ σ² / (n ε²), but wait, I might be mixing up the terms.

Wait, for Chebyshev, the variance of Y/n would be Var(Y)/n², since Var(Y) = np(1-p), so Var(Y/n) = p(1-p)/n. So, the standard deviation of Y/n is sqrt(p(1-p)/n). Let me compute that: sqrt(0.25*0.75/500) ≈ sqrt(0.1875/500) ≈ sqrt(0.000375) ≈ 0.01936.

So, Chebyshev's inequality states that P(|Y/n - p| ≥ ε) ≤ (Var(Y/n)) / (ε)². Wait, no, the inequality is P(|X - μ| ≥ kσ) ≤ 1/k². So, in this case, X is Y/n, μ is p=0.25, σ is the standard deviation I just calculated, which is 0.01936. So, ε is 0.05.

So, to use Chebyshev, I can write P(|Y/n - 0.25| ≥ 0.05) ≤ (σ²)/(ε²).

Wait, let me make sure I get the formula right. Chebyshev's inequality is P(|X - μ| ≥ kσ) ≤ 1/(k²). So, in this case, k would be ε / σ. Because ε is the distance from the mean, and σ is the standard deviation. So, k = ε / σ = 0.05 / 0.01936 ≈ 2.582.

So, then P(|Y/n - 0.25| ≥ 0.05) ≤ 1/(k²) = 1/(2.582²) ≈ 1/(6.666) ≈ 0.15. So, that means the probability that it's outside is at most 0.15, so the probability that it's inside is at least 1 - 0.15 = 0.85. So, the lower bound is 0.85.

Wait, but wait. The options include F: 0.85. So, the lower bound would be 0.85. But I'm not sure if this is correct because Chebyshev gives a conservative bound, which might not be tight. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting a better bound, but given the options, 0.85 is there as F.

Alternatively, maybe using the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) approximation, which gives a better estimate. Earlier, I calculated the probability using CLT as approximately 0.9902, but that's the approximate probability, not a lower bound. The question is about a lower bound, so Chebyshev would give a lower bound, whereas CLT gives an approximate value.

So, using Chebyshev, the lower bound is 0.85, which corresponds to option F. But wait, another thought: Chebyshev's inequality might not be the tightest possible, but it's a valid method to find a lower bound. So, the answer should be 0.85, which is option F.

The problem involves finding a lower bound for \( P(|Y/n - 0.25| < 0.05) \) where \( Y \) follows a binomial distribution with \( n = 500 \) and \( p = 0.25 \). Using Chebyshev's inequality, the variance of \( Y/n \) is calculated as \( 0.25 \times 0.75 / 500 \approx 0.000375 \), giving a standard deviation of approximately \( 0.01936 \). The bound \( \epsilon = 0.05 \) is used to determine \( k = \epsilon / \sigma \approx 2.582 \). Applying Chebyshev's inequality, \( P(|Y/n - 0.25| \geq 0.05) \leq 1/k^2 \approx 0.15 \), leading to \( P(|Y/n - 0.25| < 0.05) \geq 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 \). Thus, the lower bound is \( 0.85 \).
