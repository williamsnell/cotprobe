Okay, so I have this question about the unilateral Z-transform, and I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question asks for the Z-transform of the step sequence f[n] = u[n]. The options are from A to J, and I need to select the correct one.

First, I remember that the Z-transform is defined as F(z) = sum from n=0 to infinity of f[n] z^(-n). Since the function here is u[n], which is the unit step function, it's 1 for all n >= 0 and 0 otherwise.

So substituting, F(z) would be the sum from n=0 to infinity of u[n] z^(-n). But u[n] is 1 for all n >=0, so this simplifies to the sum from n=0 to infinity of z^(-n).

Wait, isn't that a geometric series? The sum of z^(-n) from n=0 to infinity. I think the formula for the sum of a geometric series is sum r^n from n=0 to infinity is 1/(1-r), provided |r| < 1. But in this case, each term is z^(-n), which is (1/z)^n. So r is 1/z, right?

So the sum becomes 1/(1 - (1/z)) as long as |1/z| < 1, which implies |z| > 1. That makes sense because the region of convergence for the unit step is |z| > 1.

Simplifying the denominator: 1 - (1/z) is (z -1)/z. So the sum becomes 1 divided by (z-1)/z, which is the same as z/(z-1). Wait, but that's not matching what I remember. Or does it?

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. The sum is sum_{n=0}^\infty (1/z)^n = 1/(1 - 1/z) = z/(z-1). So F(z) = z/(z-1). Hmm, looking at the options, option H is z/(1-z), option I is z/(z-1), which is what I just got. So I think H is negative of I. Wait, because 1/(1 - 1/z) is z/(z-1). So F(z) = z/(z-1), which is option I.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me check again. The sum is from n=0 to infinity of z^{-n} = sum (1/z)^n. The sum is 1/(1 - 1/z) = z/(z-1). So F(z) is z/(z-1), which is option I. But wait, another thought: sometimes the Z-transform is defined using the bilateral transform, but here it's the unilateral, so starting from n=0, which matches our approach.

Alternatively, another way to think about it: F(z) = sum_{n=0}^\infty u[n] z^{-n} = sum_{n=0}^\infty z^{-n} = sum_{n=0}^\infty (1/z)^n. That's a geometric series with ratio 1/z. Sum is 1/(1 - (1/z)) = z/(z-1). So yes, option I is correct.

Wait, but sometimes I've seen the Z-transform of u[n] written as 1/(1 - z^{-1}), which would be 1 / (1 - 1/z) = z/(z-1). So yeah, that's the same as what I got. So the correct answer should be option I: z/(z-1).

Looking back at the options, H is z/(1-z), which is the negative of I. So I think I is correct.

The Z-transform of the unit step sequence \( u[n] \) is found by summing the geometric series \( \sum_{n=0}^\infty z^{-n} \), which equals \( \frac{z}{z-1} \). This corresponds to option I.
