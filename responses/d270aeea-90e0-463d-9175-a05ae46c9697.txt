Question:

InBrowningtown, water is sold to home owners by the cubic foot at the rate of $15.31 for up to and including 3,600 cubic feet, and $.15 for each 100 cubic feet over 3,600 cubic feet. Local taxes on water usage are 4%. If the Thomas family recently received a bill for 35,700 cubic feet of water, how much were they charged?

Options:

A: $64
B: $58
C: $70
D: $80
E: $66
F: $60
G: $78
H: $74
I: $72
J: $68

Okay, so I've got this problem about the Thomas family's water bill in Browningtown. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the question says that water is priced at $15.31 for up to and including 3,600 cubic feet. Then, for every 100 cubic feet over that, it's an extra $0.15. Plus, there's a 4% local tax on the water usage. The Thomas family used 35,700 cubic feet, and we need to find out how much they were charged.

Alright, let's break this down. 

The first thing I need to do is calculate the cost beyond the initial 3,600 cubic feet. So, 35,700 minus 3,600 is 32,100 cubic feet over the limit. Now, since the charge is per 100 cubic feet over, I should divide 32,100 by 100 to find out how many units they're being charged for. That would be 321 units, because 32,100 divided by 100 is 321. 

Each of these units is $0.15, so the extra cost is 321 multiplied by $0.15. Let me calculate that: 321 * 0.15. Hmm, 300 *0.15 is 45, and 21 *0.15 is 3.15, so total is 45 +3.15 = $48.15. 

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 321 * 0.15. Let me do it differently. 321 * 0.1 is 32.1, and 321 * 0.05 is 16.05. Adding those together, 32.1 +16.05 is 48.15. Yes, that's correct. So the extra charge is $48.15. 

Now, the base charge is $15.31 for the first 3,600 cubic feet. So the total pre-tax cost would be the base plus the extra. That's 15.31 +48.15. Let's add that up: 15 + 48 is 63, and 0.31 +0.15 is 0.46, so total is $63.46. 

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me check the math again. 15.31 +48.15. Let me line them up:

15.31
+48.15
= ?

15.31 +48.15: 15 +48 is 63, 0.31 +0.15 is 0.46. So yes, 63.46. So pre-tax total is $63.46.

But then there's a 4% local tax on the water usage. So I need to calculate 4% of $63.46 and add that to get the total amount charged.

To find 4% of 63.46, I can calculate 63.46 * 0.04. Let me do that. 63 *0.04 is 2.52, and 0.46 *0.04 is 0.0184. Adding those together gives 2.52 +0.0184 = 2.5384. So the tax is approximately $2.5384.

Now, adding the tax to the pre-tax amount: 63.46 +2.5384. Let's add that up. 63 +2 is 65, 0.46 +0.5384 is 0.9984. So total is 65.9984, which is approximately $66.00.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. 

First, the extra cubic feet: 35,700 -3,600 =32,100. Divided by 100 is 321 units, each at $0.15. 321 *0.15 is 48.15. Base is 15.31, so 15.31 +48.15 =63.46. Tax is 4% of 63.46, which is 2.5384. Adding that gives 63.46 +2.5384 =65.9984, which is roughly $66.00.

Looking at the options, E is $66. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Maybe I missed something.

Alternatively, perhaps the tax is applied differently. Wait, does the tax apply to the base plus the extra, or just the extra? The problem says "local taxes on water usage are 4%." So I think it's on the entire amount before tax, which is the base plus the extra. So yes, I did that correctly.

So, total pre-tax is $63.46, tax is $2.5384, total is $65.9984, which rounds to $66. So the answer is E.

The Thomas family used 35,700 cubic feet of water. The initial charge covers up to 3,600 cubic feet at $15.31. The remaining 32,100 cubic feet are charged at $0.15 per 100 cubic feet, which totals $48.15. Adding the base charge gives a pre-tax total of $63.46. A 4% tax on this amount adds $2.5384, bringing the total to approximately $66. 

Answer: E
