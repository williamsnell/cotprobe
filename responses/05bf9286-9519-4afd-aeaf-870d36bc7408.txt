Okay, so I've got this question about the theoretical air-fuel ratio for octane combustion. Hmm, I remember that the air-fuel ratio is the mass of air needed per mass of fuel. The equation given is C8H18 + 12.5O2 + 12.5(3.76)N2 = 8CO2 + 9H2O + 47N2. I need to find the ratio of air to fuel.

Wait, first, I should probably look at the balanced equation. Octane (C8H18) is burning in air, which is 21% O2 and 79% N2. The reaction includes O2 and N2 on the reactant side, so the air is part of that.

The balanced equation shows that 1 mole of C8H18 reacts with 12.5 moles of O2 and 12.5 * 3.76 moles of N2. Wait, 3.76 is the molar ratio of air (since air is 21% O2 and 79% N2, so 0.21 O2 and 0.79 N2 per mole of air). So each mole of O2 in the reaction is part of the air, and each mole of N2 is as well.

So, the total moles of air needed would be the sum of O2 and N2. Let me calculate that. For each mole of C8H18, the moles of O2 are 12.5, and the moles of N2 are 12.5 * 3.76. Let me compute 12.5 *3.76. Hmm, 12.5 *3 is 37.5, 12.5 *0.76 is 9.5, so total is 47. So 12.5 O2 and 47 N2 per mole of C8H18.

So the total moles of air is 12.5 (O2) + 47 (N2) = 59.5 moles of air per mole of octane.

Now I need the masses. The mass of air is the sum of the masses of O2 and N2. Let me compute each part.

O2: 12.5 moles * 32 g/mol = 400 g.

N2: 47 moles * 28 g/mol = 1316 g.

So total air mass is 400 + 1316 = 1716 g.

The mass of octane is 1 mole * molar mass. Octane is C8H18: 8*12 + 18*1 = 96 + 18 = 114 g/mol.

So the air-fuel ratio is 1716 g air / 114 g fuel. Let me divide that: 1716 / 114. Let's see, 114 *15 is 1710, so 15 with 6 left, so 15.05 approximately. Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 15.1, which seems close. Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me double-check the molar masses. O2 is 32 g/mol, yes. N2 is 28 g/mol, correct. The moles of O2 is 12.5, so 12.5 *32=400. For N2, 47 moles *28=1316. So 400+1316=1716 g air.

Octane is 114 g/mol, so 1716/114 = let me calculate more accurately. 114 *15 = 1710, so 15 with a remainder of 6. 6/114 is 0.0526, so total is about 15.0526, which is approximately 15.05. The options have B as 15.1, which is the closest. But wait, maybe I should compute more accurately.

Wait, let me just divide 1716 by 114. Let me see: 114 *15 = 1710. 1716 -1710=6. 6/114=0.05263. So 15.05263, which is about 15.05. So looking at the options, B is 15.1, which is the nearest. Alternatively, maybe I should check if I missed a decimal somewhere.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is asking for the theoretical air-fuel ratio, which is AF. The formula is AF = (mass of air)/(mass of fuel). So AF = (mass_air)/(mass_fuel).

Wait, in the reaction, 1 mole of C8H18 uses 12.5 moles O2 and 12.5 *3.76 N2. Let me compute 12.5 *3.76 again. 12.5 *3=37.5, 12.5 *0.76=9.5, so 37.5+9.5=47. So 47 moles N2 and 12.5 O2. So total moles air is 47 +12.5=59.5 moles.

Mass of O2: 12.5 *32 =400g.

Mass of N2:47 *28= 1316g.

Total air mass:400+1316=1716g.

Mass of fuel is 114g.

So AF =1716/114 = let me compute 1716 ÷ 114.

Let me do this division:

114 *15=1710 → 15 with a remainder of 6.

So 6/114 = 0.05263. So AF=15.05263.

Looking at the options, the closest is B:15.1. But wait, option E is 28.96. That seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the equation is written as including the N2 on the product side. Wait, the equation given is C8H18 + 12.5O2 +12.5(3.76)N2 → products. So that's 12.5 *3.76 N2, which is 47 N2, which is correct.

Wait, but maybe I should check if the question is about molar ratio or mass ratio. Wait, the question says theoretical air-fuel ratio, so it's mass air per mass fuel.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is in g/g, as in grams of air per gram of fuel.

So 1716 g air per 114 g fuel → 1716/114 ≈15.05, so approximately 15.05.

Looking at the options:

A:14.7

B:15.1

C:13.4

D:20.3

E:28.96

F:10

G:18.5

H:12.5

I:16.2

J:47

So 15.05 is closest to 15.1, which is option B. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but what if I made a mistake in the calculation? Let me check again.

Wait, 12.5 *3.76 =47. So 47 N2, correct. 12.5 O2.

Mass O2:12.5 *32=400.

Mass N2:47 *28=1316.

Total air mass:400+1316=1716.

Fuel mass:114.

1716/114=15.0526, which is approximately 15.05. So yes, option B is 15.1, which is the correct choice.

To determine the theoretical air-fuel ratio for the combustion of octane, we analyze the given reaction:

**C₈H₁₈ + 12.5O₂ + 12.5(3.76)N₂ → 8CO₂ + 9H₂O + 47N₂**

### Step 1: Calculate the moles of air required
- **O₂**: 12.5 moles
- **N₂**: 12.5 × 3.76 = 47 moles

Total moles of air = 12.5 (O₂) + 47 (N₂) = **59.5 moles of air per mole of C₈H₁₈**.

### Step 2: Calculate the mass of air
- **O₂ mass**: 12.5 moles × 32 g/mol = 400 g
- **N₂ mass**: 47 moles × 28 g/mol = 1316 g

Total air mass = 400 g + 1316 g = **1716 g of air per mole of C₈H₁₈**.

### Step 3: Calculate the mass of octane
The molar mass of C₈H₁₈ is:
- Carbon (C): 12 × 8 = 96 g
- Hydrogen (H): 1 × 18 = 18 g

Total molar mass of octane = 96 g + 18 g = **114 g per mole**.

### Step 4: Determine the air-fuel ratio
The air-fuel ratio (AF) is the mass of air divided by the mass of fuel:
\[
AF = \frac{1716 \, \text{g air}}{114 \, \text{g fuel}} \approx 15.05
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The closest value to 15.05 is **15.1 g air/g fuel**, which corresponds to **Option B**.

**Answer: B**
