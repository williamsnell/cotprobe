Okay, so I've got this problem in front of me about calculating partial pressures of gases in a compressed tank. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my gas laws, but I'll try to remember.

The question says that dry air is composed by volume of 78.1% N₂, 20.9% O₂, and 1% other gases. The tank is compressed to 10.0 atmospheres, and I need to find the partial pressures of each gas component.

Hmm, I remember that partial pressure is the pressure each gas would exert if it were alone in the container, right? And Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures says that the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures. So each gas's partial pressure is just its mole fraction multiplied by the total pressure.

Wait, but since the composition is given by volume percent, and at the same temperature and pressure, volume percent equals mole percent. Oh yeah, because in the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, so if V is proportional to n at the same P and T, then volume percent is the same as mole percent.

So the mole fractions would be the same as the given percentages. Let me write that down.

Mole fraction of N₂ is 78.1%, which is 0.781. O₂ is 20.9%, so 0.209. Other gases are 1%, so 0.01.

The total pressure is 10.0 atm. So each partial pressure is calculated by multiplying the mole fraction by the total pressure.

Let me calculate each one.

For N₂: 0.781 * 10 atm = 7.81 atm.

For O₂: 0.209 * 10 atm = 2.09 atm.

For other gases: 0.01 * 10 atm = 0.10 atm.

Wait, but looking at the options, I'm seeing different numbers. Let me check if I did that right.

Wait, option J has P_N2 as 7.81 atm, which matches what I got. O₂ is 2.09, which also matches. And other gases at 0.10 atm. So option J would be correct.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake with the percentages. The percentages add up to 78.1 + 20.9 + 1 = 100%, so that's correct.

Another way to think: if it's 10 atm total, each percentage point is 0.1 atm. So 78.1% would be 7.81 atm, yes, and so on.

So the correct partial pressures would be N₂:7.81, O₂:2.09, others:0.10. That's exactly option J.

To determine the partial pressures of each gas component in the compressed tank, we use Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures, which states that the partial pressure of a gas is the product of its mole fraction and the total pressure. Since the composition is given by volume percent, and volume percent equals mole percent under the same conditions of temperature and pressure, we can directly use the given percentages as mole fractions.

1. **Mole Fractions**:
   - Nitrogen (N₂): 78.1% = 0.781
   - Oxygen (O₂): 20.9% = 0.209
   - Other gases: 1% = 0.010

2. **Total Pressure**: 10.0 atm

3. **Partial Pressures**:
   - \( P_{N_2} = 0.781 \times 10.0 = 7.81 \, \text{atm} \)
   - \( P_{O_2} = 0.209 \times 10.0 = 2.09 \, \text{atm} \)
   - \( P_{\text{other gases}} = 0.010 \times 10.0 = 0.10 \, \text{atm} \)

These calculations match the values provided in option J, making it the correct choice.

Answer: J
