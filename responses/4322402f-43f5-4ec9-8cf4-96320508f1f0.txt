Okay, so I have this question about the WHO's recommendation on free sugars intake. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that the WHO has guidelines regarding sugar intake. I think they advise against consuming too much sugar because it's linked to health issues like obesity and tooth decay. But I'm not exactly sure about the exact percentage they recommend.

Wait, I think a while back, the WHO suggested limiting sugar intake to less than 10% of total calories. I've heard that before. But I'm not 100% certain if it's exactly 10% or a bit lower. Oh, right, there was a more recent recommendation where they advised even lower, maybe 5%, but that was more of an ideal target rather than a strong recommendation. Or was that the other way around?

Let me break it down. The options are A through J. The question is about the maximum intake. So looking at the options, C is <10%, E is <5%, and so on.

I recall that the WHO's guideline is that free sugars should be less than 10% of total energy intake. They also suggested that reducing it further to 5% would provide additional health benefits, but that's more of a conditional recommendation, I think.

So the strong recommendation is the 10% cap. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C, which is <10%.

Wait, but in the options, option C is <10% and option J is 5-10%. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The WHO says the maximum is 10%, so the maximum intake should be less than 10%, which is option C. But some sources might present the ideal as 5%, but that's a target, not the maximum.

Alternatively, maybe the question is phrased as a maximum, so the recommendation is to keep it below 10%, making option C the right choice. Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's C.

The WHO recommends that the maximum intake of free sugars should be less than 10% of total energy intake. While they also suggest that reducing intake further to 5% could offer additional health benefits, the strong recommendation is for less than 10%.
