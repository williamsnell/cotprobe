Question:

Ted Logan, as a result of a recent illness, spent 72 days in a hospital at $52 a day and 30 days in a convalescent home at $13 a day. After returning home, he had a visiting nurse calling on him three times a week for ten weeks at $12 a call. In addition, he had doctor's bills totaling $1335. Mr. Logan is covered by Medicare hospitalization and medical insurance. The coverage he is entitled to is listed below: Medicare Coverage Schedule Type of Expense Coverage 1. Hospitalization $0 for first $72 of expense, Up to $75 per day for up to 60 days thereafter, and up to $34 per day thereafter. 2. Convalescent home Up to $15 per day for days 1-20 and up to $4.50 per day thereafter 3. Visiting nurse service Up to $20 per visit 4. Doctor's service 80% of the first $1275. What are Mr. Logan's total medical expenses? How much of them will Medicare pay? How much must Mr. Logan pay?

Options:

A: $7200, $5243, $1957
B: $6500, $5243, $842
C: $7000, $6000, $1000
D: $5985, $5700, $285
E: $5985, $5243, $742
F: $5985, $4500, $1485

J: $5000, $4500, $500

Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this problem about Ted Logan's medical expenses and figuring out how much Medicare will cover. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll list out all the expenses Ted had:

1. Hospitalization: 72 days at $52 per day.
2. Convalescent home: 30 days at $13 per day.
3. Visiting nurse: 3 times a week for ten weeks at $12 per call.
4. Doctor's bills: Totaling $1335.

Now, I need to calculate each of these expenses and then figure out how much Medicare covers for each. Then, I'll sum up the total expenses, what Medicare pays, and what Ted has to pay out of pocket.

Starting with the hospitalization. He stayed 72 days, so 72 * $52. Let me compute that: 72 * 50 is 3600, and 72 * 2 is 144, so total is 3600 + 144 = $3744.

Next, convalescent home: 30 days at $13 each. 30 * 13 is 390. So that's $390.

Visiting nurse: Three times a week for ten weeks. That's 3 * 10 = 30 visits. Each visit is $12, so 30 * 12 = $360.

Doctor's bills are straightforward: $1335.

Now, adding all these up: 3744 + 390 = 4134. Then 4134 + 360 = 4494. Then 4494 + 1335 = 5829. Wait, but looking at the options, the totals are around 5985 or 6500. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check.

Wait, no, 72 * 52 is indeed 3744. 30 *13 is 390. 30 visits at 12 each is 360. 3744 + 390 is 4134, plus 360 is 4494, plus 1335 is 5829. Wait, but none of the options have 5829. Hmm. The options have 5985, 6500, etc. Maybe I miscalculated somewhere.

Wait, let me check the problem again. Oh, wait! The visiting nurse is three times a week for ten weeks. So 3 times/week * 10 weeks = 30 visits. At $12 each, that's 30*12=360. That's correct.

So total medical expenses would be 3744 + 390 + 360 + 1335 = let's add them again:

3744 + 390 = 4134.

4134 + 360 = 4494.

4494 + 1335 = 5829.

Wait, but the options don't have 5829. The closest is E and F with 5985.

Hmm. Did I miss something? Let me check each part again.

Hospitalization: 72 days at $52. 72*52.

Let me compute 70*52=3640, plus 2*52=104, total 3640+104=3744. Correct.

Convalescent: 30 days at $13. 30*13=390.

Visiting nurse: 3 times a week for 10 weeks: 3*10=30 visits. 30*12=360.

Doctor's bills: $1335.

So 3744 + 390 = 4134.

4134 + 360 = 4494.

4494 + 1335: Let's compute that again. 4494 + 1000=5494, 5494 + 335=5829.

So total expenses are $5,829. But none of the options match this. The options have either 5985, 6500, etc. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the visiting nurse part. Let me check.

Wait, the visiting nurse is three times a week for ten weeks. So 3*10=30 visits. Each visit is $12, so 30*12=360. That's correct. So total is 5829.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm miscalculating something else. Let me check the problem again.

Wait, the problem says he spent 72 days in the hospital at $52 a day. So that's correct. 72*52=3744.

Convalescent home: 30 days at $13. 30*13=390.

Visiting nurse: 3 times a week for ten weeks. So 3*10=30 visits. 30*12=360.

Doctor's bills: $1335.

So total is 3744 + 390 = 4134; +360=4494; +1335=5829.

Wait, but perhaps the visiting nurse is per week, but three times a week for ten weeks. That's 3*10=30, correct.

Hmm, the options don't have 5829, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the visiting nurse is 3 times a week for ten weeks, but each visit is $12, so 3*12=36 per week. 36*10=360. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the visiting nurse is per visit, but maybe the total is 3 visits per week, so 3*12=36 per week, and 10 weeks would be 36*10=360. So that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something else. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, E is $5985, F is $5985 as well. Hmm, perhaps I missed some days or something else.

Wait, perhaps the convalescent home is 30 days, but the coverage for convalescent home is up to $15 per day for days 1-20 and $4.50 thereafter. So maybe the total cost is more than that? No, the cost is 30 days at $13 each, so 390. But perhaps the coverage is different.

Wait, perhaps the total expenses are correct, but the options have 5985, which is higher than 5829. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, let me try adding again: 3744 (hospital) + 390 (convalescent) = 4134.

4134 + 360 (visiting nurse) = 4494.

4494 + 1335 (doctor) = 5829.

Hmm. Let me see the options again.

Options:

A: $7200, $5243, $1957

B: $6500, $5243, $842

C: $7000, $6000, $1000

D: $5985, $5700, $285

E: $5985, $5243, $742

F: $5985, $4500, $1485

G: $6500, $5000, $1500

H: $5985, $5000, $985

I: $5000, $5243, -$243

J: $5000, $4500, $500

Wait, so option E has total expenses of $5985. That's more than what I calculated. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me check each expense again.

Hospitalization: 72 days at $52 per day. 72 *52.

Let me compute 70*52=3640, 2*52=104. Total 3640+104=3744. Correct.

Convalescent home: 30 days at $13. 30*13=390.

Visiting nurse: 3 times a week for ten weeks. 3*10=30 visits. Each visit $12. 30*12=360.

Doctor's bills: $1335.

So 3744 + 390 = 4134.

4134 +360=4494.

4494 +1335=5829.

Hmm, but maybe the convalescent home cost is higher than $13 per day? Wait, no, the problem says he spent $13 per day, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the convalescent home days are beyond 20, so the coverage is different. But for total cost, it's 30 days at $13, so 390. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the visiting nurse is per week, but maybe it's per visit, but that's what I used. 3 visits per week for 10 weeks = 30 visits. So 30*12=360.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the visiting nurse is three times a week, but for ten weeks, so 3*10=30, correct.

So total expenses are 5829. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, the problem says "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculations, and the correct total is 5985.

Let me see: 5985-5829=156. Maybe I missed some expense of $156.

Wait, perhaps the visiting nurse is 3 times a week for ten weeks, but each visit is $12, so 3*10=30 visits. 30*12=360. Correct.

Wait, maybe the convalescent home days are more than 30? No, the problem says 30 days.

Alternatively, perhaps the doctor's bills are $1335, but maybe there's another expense. Wait, no, the problem lists four expenses: hospital, convalescent, visiting nurse, and doctor's bills.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the total is 5829, but the options have 5985. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the calculations.

Let me check the hospitalization again: 72 days * $52.

Compute 70*52=3640, 2*52=104. Total 3744. Correct.

Convalescent: 30 days at 13: 30*13=390. Correct.

Visiting nurse: 30 visits at 12 each: 360. Correct.

Doctor: 1335.

Total: 3744 + 390 = 4134.

4134 + 360 = 4494.

4494 + 1335 = 5829.

Hmm. So maybe the correct total is 5829, but none of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the hospitalization coverage is different. Let me check the coverage details.

The coverage for hospitalization is: $0 for the first $72, up to $75 per day for up to 60 days, and up to $34 per day thereafter.

So, hospitalization: 72 days.

First 72 days: coverage is $0 for the first 72 days? Wait, no, the coverage is $0 for the first $72 of expense. Wait, no, the coverage is structured as:

1. Hospitalization: $0 for the first $72 of expense. Then, up to $75 per day for up to 60 days. Then, up to $34 per day thereafter.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. So the first 72 days, the coverage is $0. Then, for days beyond that, up to 60 days, coverage is $75 per day. Wait, but he was in the hospital for 72 days. So the first 72 days: coverage is $0. But wait, that can't be right because 72 days is more than 60. Let me think.

Wait, the coverage is:

- $0 for the first $72 of expense (so the first 72 days, hospitalization cost is covered at $0? Or perhaps it's the first 72 days, but that seems too much. Alternatively, perhaps the coverage is $0 for the first 72 days, then $75 per day for the next 60 days, then $34 per day beyond that.

Wait, the problem says: "Hospitalization: $0 for first $72 of expense, Up to $75 per day for up to 60 days thereafter, and up to $34 per day thereafter."

Wait, I think it's structured as:

- For the first 72 days, the coverage is $0 per day. So days 1-72: $0 coverage, meaning he pays the full amount.

But wait, that doesn't make sense because 72 days is a lot. Alternatively, perhaps the coverage is $0 for the first $72 of expense, meaning that any expense up to $72 is covered at $0, but beyond that, he pays more. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the coverage. Let me parse it again.

The coverage for hospitalization is:

- $0 for the first $72 of expense.

- Up to $75 per day for up to 60 days thereafter.

- Up to $34 per day thereafter.

So, perhaps the first $72 of hospital expenses are covered at 100%, then for the next 60 days, up to $75 per day is covered, and beyond that, up to $34 per day.

Wait, but he was in the hospital for 72 days. So the first 72 days would have a coverage of $0 for the first $72, but that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps it's structured as:

- The first 72 days are covered at $0 per day, meaning he pays nothing for the first 72 days. But that's not possible because the total hospital cost is 72*52=3744, which is way more than $72.

Alternatively, perhaps the coverage is:

- The first 72 days: $0 coverage (i.e., he pays the full amount).

But that can't be right because the coverage can't be zero for the first 72 days. Alternatively, perhaps it's a deductible of $72, after which coverage starts.

Wait, the wording is: "Hospitalization $0 for first $72 of expense, Up to $75 per day for up to 60 days thereafter, and up to $34 per day thereafter."

So, for the first $72 of expense, Medicare pays $0. So, if the hospital charges more than $72, the first $72 are not covered, and the rest may be covered.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the hospital charges per day. So perhaps it's a deductible of $72, and then beyond that, coverage starts.

But that seems confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the coverage is:

- For the first 72 days, Medicare pays $0 per day. So he pays the full amount for the first 72 days.

But that would mean he pays 72*52=3744, and Medicare pays nothing for those days.

Wait, but that seems unlikely because usually insurance covers part. Alternatively, perhaps the coverage is:

- For the first 72 days, Medicare pays $0 (i.e., no coverage), but that seems harsh.

Alternatively, perhaps the coverage is:

- The first 72 days: 100% coverage (Medicare pays the full amount), but that would mean Medicare pays 72*52=3744, which seems high.

But looking at the coverage details again: "Hospitalization $0 for first $72 of expense, Up to $75 per day for up to 60 days thereafter, and up to $34 per day thereafter."

Wait, perhaps the first $72 of hospital expenses are covered at 100% (Medicare pays $72), and then for the next 60 days, up to $75 per day is covered, and beyond that, up to $34 per day.

But that would mean that if the hospital stay is more than 72 days, the first 72 days are covered at 100%, and days beyond that are covered at $75 per day up to 60 days, then $34 per day beyond that.

Wait, but Ted stayed 72 days. So:

- First 72 days: Medicare covers $0 (i.e., he pays the full amount). Or perhaps the first $72 is a deductible, and beyond that, coverage starts.

This is confusing. Let me try to clarify.

The coverage for hospitalization is:

- $0 for the first $72 of expense.

Meaning that for the first $72, Medicare pays $0, so Ted pays the full $72.

Then, for each day after that, up to 60 days, Medicare pays up to $75 per day.

Wait, but he was in the hospital for 72 days. So:

- First 72 days: total expense is 72 *52=3744.

Wait, but the coverage is $0 for the first $72, so that would mean he pays the first $72, and then for the remaining days, perhaps coverage starts.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the coverage is:

- For the first 72 days, Medicare covers 100% of the cost, so they pay $72, and beyond that, up to $75 per day for the next 60 days, etc.

But that would make more sense. So:

Hospitalization:

- First 72 days: Medicare pays $72 (100% coverage).

- Days 73 to 133 (72+60): up to $75 per day.

- Days beyond 133: up to $34 per day.

But Ted was only in the hospital for 72 days, so he's within the first 72 days. Therefore, Medicare would cover the first $72, and he would pay the remaining.

Wait, but the hospital cost is 72 days at $52, which is 3744. So:

- Medicare covers $72.

- Ted pays 3744 -72 = 3672.

Wait, but that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the coverage is that for the first 72 days, Medicare pays $0, meaning Ted pays the full 3744.

But that can't be right because that would make his payment too high. Alternatively, perhaps the coverage is:

- For the first 72 days, Medicare pays $72, and the rest is covered at a certain rate.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's calculate Medicare's payment for each expense.

Starting with hospitalization:

Total hospital cost: 72 *52=3744.

Coverage:

- $0 for the first $72.

- Up to $75 per day for up to 60 days.

- Up to $34 per day thereafter.

Since he stayed 72 days, which is 72 days.

So:

- First 72 days: the first $72 is covered at $0, so he pays $72.

Wait, that can't be right because 72 days at $52 is 3744, which is way more than $72.

Alternatively, perhaps the coverage is that for the first 72 days, Medicare covers $72, and the rest is covered at $75 per day beyond that. But he only stayed 72 days, so perhaps Medicare covers $72, and he pays the remaining 3744-72=3672.

But that seems too much. Alternatively, perhaps the coverage is:

- For the first 72 days, Medicare pays $0 per day, so he pays the full 3744.

But that's not likely. Maybe the coverage is that for the first 72 days, Medicare covers 100% of the cost, so they pay 3744, and he pays nothing.

But that would make the Medicare payment higher. Let me see the options. For example, option E says Medicare pays $5243, which would require a higher coverage.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to calculate each expense's Medicare coverage and then sum them up.

Hospitalization:

Total cost: 72 *52=3744.

Coverage:

- First $72: Medicare pays $0.

- Days 73-132 (60 days): up to $75 per day.

- Days beyond 132: up to $34 per day.

But since he was only in for 72 days, he doesn't reach the $75 per day coverage. So, Medicare pays nothing for the first $72, but he's in the hospital for 72 days, which is way beyond 72 days. Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the coverage is:

- The first 72 days: Medicare pays $0 (i.e., he pays full).

- Days 73-132 (60 days): Medicare pays $75 per day.

- Days beyond 132: Medicare pays $34 per day.

But he stayed 72 days, which is within the first 72 days, so Medicare pays $0, and he pays the full 3744.

Convalescent home:

30 days at $13 each, total 390.

Coverage:

- Up to $15 per day for days 1-20.

- Up to $4.50 per day thereafter.

So:

- First 20 days: 20 *15=300.

- Days 21-30: 10 days *4.50=45.

Total coverage: 300 +45=345.

So Medicare pays 345.

Convalescent home cost: 390.

So Ted's payment: 390 -345=45.

Visiting nurse:

30 visits at $12 each, total 360.

Coverage: up to $20 per visit.

So Medicare pays 30 *20=600.

Wait, but the total expense is 360, so Medicare can't pay more than the expense. So Medicare pays $360 (since the coverage is up to $20 per visit, but the total is 360, which is 30*12=360. So Medicare would pay up to $360, but the coverage is $20 per visit, so 30*20=600. But since the total is 360, Medicare would pay 360, and Ted pays 0. Because the coverage is up to $20 per visit, which is more than the cost per visit.

Wait, no. Each visit is $12, which is less than $20. So Medicare would cover the entire $12 per visit. So total coverage is 30*12=360, so Medicare pays 360, Ted pays 0.

Wait, no, wait. The visiting nurse service coverage is up to $20 per visit. So if each visit costs $12, Medicare would pay $12, as it's up to $20. So total coverage is 30*12=360. So Medicare pays 360, Ted pays 0.

Doctor's bills: $1335.

Coverage: 80% of the first $1275.

So Medicare pays 80% of 1275= 0.8*1275=1020.

So Ted pays 1335 -1020=315.

Now, summing up Medicare's payments:

Hospitalization: Since he was in for 72 days, and the coverage is $0 for the first $72, but that can't be right. Wait, earlier I thought that for hospitalization, the first 72 days are covered at $0, but that would mean he pays 3744. But looking at the coverage, perhaps the first 72 days are covered at 100%, so Medicare pays 3744. But that seems high.

Wait, but let me check the coverage again: "Hospitalization $0 for first $72 of expense, Up to $75 per day for up to 60 days thereafter, and up to $34 per day thereafter."

So, the first $72 of expense is covered at $0, meaning Ted pays the first $72. Then, for the next 60 days, up to $75 per day is covered. But he was in the hospital for 72 days, which is beyond 72 days.

Wait, perhaps the coverage is:

- For the first 72 days: Medicare pays $0, so Ted pays 72*52=3744.

But that seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps the coverage is that for the first 72 days, Medicare pays 100% of the cost, so they pay 3744.

But let's proceed with the assumption that for the first 72 days, Medicare pays $0 (i.e., Ted pays the full amount), and beyond that, they pay $75 per day for up to 60 days.

But since he only stayed 72 days, which is exactly 72 days, he doesn't go beyond 72, so Medicare pays nothing for hospitalization. That can't be right because then his total payment would be very high.

Alternatively, perhaps the coverage is structured as:

- The first 72 days: Medicare pays $72 (100% of the first $72).

- Days 73-132: $75 per day.

- Days beyond 132: $34 per day.

But he stayed 72 days, so only the first $72 is covered, and the rest is not. So Medicare pays $72, and Ted pays 3744 -72=3672.

But that seems more plausible.

So, let's recalculate:

Hospitalization:

Medicare pays $72.

Convalescent home:

Medicare pays 345.

Visiting nurse:

Medicare pays 360.

Doctor's bills:

Medicare pays 1020.

Total Medicare payment: 72 +345 +360 +1020= let's add:

72 +345=417.

417 +360=777.

777 +1020=1797.

Wait, that's $1,797. But looking at the options, Medicare's payments are much higher, like $5243 in option E.

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the hospitalization coverage.

Wait, perhaps the coverage is that for the first 72 days, Medicare pays 100% of the cost, which is 72*52=3744.

Then, for days beyond 72, but he only stayed 72 days, so Medicare pays 3744.

Convalescent home:

Medicare pays 345.

Visiting nurse: 360.

Doctor's bills: 1020.

Total Medicare: 3744 +345=4089; +360=4449; +1020=5469.

So total Medicare payment is 5469.

But looking at the options, option E says Medicare pays 5243, which is close but not exact.

Wait, perhaps the hospitalization coverage is $75 per day for the first 60 days beyond the first 72. But he only stayed 72 days, so perhaps he's within the first 72 days, and Medicare pays 100% of that.

Alternatively, perhaps the coverage is:

Hospitalization:

- First 72 days: 100% coverage (Medicare pays 3744).

Convalescent home: 345.

Visiting nurse: 360.

Doctor's bills: 1020.

Total Medicare: 3744 +345=4089; +360=4449; +1020=5469.

So total expenses: 3744 +390=4134; +360=4494; +1335=5829.

Medicare pays 5469.

So Ted's payment: 5829 -5469=360.

But looking at the options, none have this. The closest is option E: total expenses 5985, Medicare 5243, Ted pays 742.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the hospitalization coverage.

Let me try another approach. Maybe the hospitalization coverage is:

- First 72 days: Medicare pays $72.

- Then, for the next 60 days, $75 per day.

But he only stayed 72 days, so only the first $72 is covered, and the rest is not.

So Medicare pays 72.

Convalescent home: 345.

Visiting nurse: 360.

Doctor's bills: 1020.

Total Medicare: 72+345=417; +360=777; +1020=1797.

Total expenses: 5829.

Ted pays 5829 -1797=4032.

But that's not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the hospitalization coverage is that the first 72 days are covered at $75 per day, but that's not what the problem says.

Alternatively, perhaps the coverage is:

Hospitalization:

- First 72 days: Medicare pays $0.

- Days 73-132: $75 per day.

- Days beyond 132: $34 per day.

But he was only in for 72 days, so Medicare pays $0 for hospitalization.

Convalescent home: 345.

Visiting nurse: 360.

Doctor's bills: 1020.

Total Medicare: 0 +345=345; +360=705; +1020=1725.

Ted pays 5829-1725=4104.

But again, not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the coverage for hospitalization is that the first 72 days are covered at $75 per day, but that's not what the problem states. The problem says "Hospitalization $0 for first $72 of expense, Up to $75 per day for up to 60 days thereafter, and up to $34 per day thereafter."

So, the first $72 of expense is covered at $0, meaning Ted pays the first $72. Then, for each day after that, up to 60 days, Medicare pays up to $75 per day. Beyond that, up to $34 per day.

So, for 72 days in the hospital:

- First $72: Ted pays $72.

- Days 73-72: Wait, he only stayed 72 days, so he doesn't reach day 73. So, beyond the first $72, he has 72 days, but the first $72 is covered at $0, meaning he pays $72.

Wait, that can't be right because 72 days at $52 is 3744, which is way more than $72. So, perhaps the coverage is that the first $72 is a deductible, and beyond that, each day is covered at $75 up to 60 days.

So:

Hospital cost: 72 days *52=3744.

Coverage:

- First $72: Ted pays $72.

- Days 73-132: 60 days *75=4500.

But he only stayed 72 days, so he doesn't reach day 73. So, Medicare pays nothing beyond the first $72.

Thus, Medicare pays $0 for hospitalization beyond the first $72, which Ted has to pay.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let me try to approach this methodically.

Each expense's coverage:

1. Hospitalization:

Total cost: 72 *52=3744.

Coverage:

- First $72: $0 paid by Medicare (Ted pays $72).

- Days 73-132 (60 days): $75 per day (but he didn't stay that long).

- Days beyond 132: $34 per day.

Since he stayed 72 days, only the first $72 is covered at $0, so Ted pays $72 for the first part, and for the remaining 72-1=71 days, he pays full price.

Wait, no, that can't be because 72 days is the total. So, perhaps the first $72 is a deductible, and the remaining 3744-72=3672 is covered at $75 per day for up to 60 days, then $34 per day.

But 3672 /75=48.96 days, which is less than 60, so Medicare would cover 48 days at $75, and the remaining 72-48=24 days at $34.

Wait, but that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the coverage is that after the first $72, each day is covered at $75 up to 60 days.

So:

- First $72: Ted pays $72.

- Next 60 days: 60 *75=4500.

But he stayed 72 days, so after the first 72, he has 72-1=71 more days. So, he can get 60 days covered at $75, and the remaining 11 days at $34.

So, Medicare coverage:

75*60=4500.

34*11=374.

Total coverage: 4500+374=4874.

But the total hospital cost is 3744, which is less than 4874. So Medicare would cover the entire 3744 beyond the first $72.

Wait, this is getting too tangled. Let me try to find another approach.

Perhaps it's better to look at each option and see which one fits.

Option E: Total expenses $5985, Medicare pays $5243, Ted pays $742.

So, total expenses 5985.

Let me see if that adds up.

Hospital: 72*52=3744.

Convalescent:30*13=390.

Visiting nurse:30*12=360.

Doctor:1335.

Total:3744+390=4134; +360=4494; +1335=5829.

Wait, but option E says total is 5985, which is higher than 5829 by 156.

So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the convalescent home is more expensive. Wait, no, the problem says 30 days at $13 each.

Wait, perhaps the visiting nurse is 3 times a week for ten weeks, which is 3*10=30 visits, but each visit is $12, so 360. Correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the convalescent home has a higher rate. Wait, the problem says $13 a day, so 30*13=390.

Hmm. Unless there's a miscalculation in the coverage.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the visiting nurse service is covered at up to $20 per visit, and since each visit is $12, Medicare covers all of it, so Ted pays nothing.

But let's see the options again. Option E: total expenses 5985, Medicare pays 5243, Ted pays 742.

So, 5985-5243=742.

Let me see if the total expenses are 5985.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the visiting nurse.

Visiting nurse: 3 times a week for ten weeks is 3*10=30 visits.

If each visit is $12, that's 360.

But perhaps the visiting nurse's total is higher. Let me see.

Wait, 3 times a week for ten weeks: 3*10=30 visits. At $12 each, 360.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the total expenses are 5985, and I'm getting 5829, so maybe I missed some days.

Wait, maybe the convalescent home is 30 days at $13, which is 390.

But perhaps the convalescent home has a higher coverage, so Ted pays less. But that affects the total expenses, not the total cost.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the convalescent home's coverage is up to $15 per day for the first 20 days, and up to $4.50 per day thereafter. So, the coverage is 20*15=300, and 10*4.50=45, total 345.

So, Ted's payment for convalescent home is 390-345=45.

Similarly, visiting nurse: covered at 360, so Ted pays 0.

Hospitalization: perhaps the coverage is more.

Wait, perhaps the hospitalization coverage is that for the first 72 days, Medicare pays $0, but that would mean Ted pays 3744.

But that's not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the hospitalization is covered as follows:

- First 72 days: Medicare pays $72.

- Days beyond that: up to $75 per day for 60 days.

But he only stayed 72 days, so only the first $72 is covered.

So, Medicare pays 72.

Convalescent:345.

Visiting nurse:360.

Doctor's:1020.

Total Medicare: 72+345=417; +360=777; +1020=1797.

So, total expenses 5829.

Medicare pays 1797.

Ted pays 5829-1797=4032.

But none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps the coverage for hospitalization is that the first 72 days are covered at $75 per day, but that's not what the problem states.

Alternatively, perhaps the coverage for hospitalization is that the first 72 days are covered at 100%, so Medicare pays 3744.

Then, convalescent home:345.

Visiting nurse:360.

Doctor's:1020.

Total Medicare:3744+345=4089; +360=4449; +1020=5469.

Total expenses:5829.

So, Ted pays 5829-5469=360.

But again, not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the visiting nurse is covered at $20 per visit, but each visit is $12, so Medicare covers all, paying 360, and Ted pays 0.

So, let's try to figure out which option could fit.

Looking at option E: total expenses 5985, Medicare 5243, Ted 742.

If total expenses are 5985, and I'm calculating 5829, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, maybe the visiting nurse is 3 times a week for ten weeks, which is 3*10=30 visits, but each visit is $12, so 360. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the visiting nurse's coverage is up to $20 per visit, but the total is 360, so Medicare pays 360, and Ted pays 0.

So, perhaps the total expenses are 5829, and the Medicare payments are as follows:

Hospitalization: let's say Medicare pays 3744.

Convalescent home:345.

Visiting nurse:360.

Doctor's:1020.

Total Medicare:3744+345=4089; +360=4449; +1020=5469.

So, total expenses 5829.

Ted pays 5829-5469=360.

But none of the options have this.

Wait, perhaps the coverage for hospitalization is that the first 72 days are covered at $75 per day, but that's not what the problem says.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the total expenses are 5985, and I'm missing 156.

Let me see: 5985-5829=156.

Where could this come from?

Wait, perhaps the convalescent home has 30 days, but the coverage is up to 20 days at $15, and 10 days at $4.50, so 20*15=300, 10*4.50=45, total 345.

So, the cost is 390, and coverage is 345, so Ted pays 45.

But that's included in my earlier calculation.

Wait, perhaps the visiting nurse is 3 times a week for ten weeks, which is 30 visits, but each visit is $12, so 360. Correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to look for the option where total expenses are 5985.

5985-5829=156.

So, perhaps I missed an expense of $156.

Wait, perhaps the problem includes something else, like a deductible for the doctor's bills.

Wait, the doctor's bills are $1335, and the coverage is 80% of the first $1275.

So, 0.8*1275=1020.

Thus, Ted pays 1335-1020=315.

But 315 is less than 360, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the doctor's coverage is 80% of the first $1275, so 1020, and the remaining 1335-1275=60 is covered at 80% as well? No, because it's only the first $1275.

So, Ted pays 1335-1020=315.

So, adding up:

Hospital:3744.

Convalescent:390.

Visiting nurse:360.

Doctor:1335.

Total:3744+390=4134; +360=4494; +1335=5829.

So, total is 5829.

But the options have 5985, which is 156 more.

Wait, perhaps the convalescent home is 30 days at $13, but the coverage is up to $15 for the first 20 days, and $4.50 for the next 10, so total coverage is 345, as before. So Ted pays 45.

But that's included.

Wait, perhaps the visiting nurse is 3 times a week for ten weeks, which is 30 visits, but each visit is $12, so 360. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the visiting nurse is considered a different way. For example, perhaps each week has three visits, so 10 weeks would be 10 visits, not 30. But that doesn't make sense because it's three times a week.

Wait, no, three times a week for ten weeks is 3*10=30 visits.

I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option E: total expenses 5985, Medicare 5243, Ted 742.

So, total expenses 5985.

Let me see: 5985-5829=156.

Perhaps the problem includes something else, like a co-pay for the doctor's bills beyond $1275.

Wait, the doctor's bills are $1335, which is $1275 plus $60.

The coverage is 80% of the first $1275, which is 1020.

So, beyond $1275, the coverage is nothing, so Ted pays the full $60.

So, total doctor's payment:1335.

So, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the visiting nurse's coverage is up to $20 per visit, but the total is 360, which is 30 visits *12=360. So Medicare covers all 360, and Ted pays 0.

So, perhaps the total expenses are 5985, and Medicare pays 5243, so Ted pays 742.

How?

Let me compute:

Hospitalization: let's say Medicare pays 3744.

Convalescent home:345.

Visiting nurse:360.

Doctor's:1020.

Total Medicare:3744+345=4089; +360=4449; +1020=5469.

But 5469 is less than 5243. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the coverage for hospitalization is less.

Wait, perhaps the hospitalization coverage is:

First $72: Medicare pays $0.

Then, up to $75 per day for 60 days.

So, for 72 days:

First 72: $0 coverage.

Then, days 73-132: 60 days at $75: 60*75=4500.

But he only stayed 72 days, so he doesn't reach day 73.

Thus, Medicare pays $0 for hospitalization.

Convalescent home:345.

Visiting nurse:360.

Doctor's:1020.

Total Medicare:0+345=345; +360=705; +1020=1725.

Total expenses:5829.

Ted pays 5829-1725=4104.

But that's not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the coverage for hospitalization is that the first 72 days are covered at $75 per day, but that's not what the problem says.

Alternatively, perhaps the coverage is:

Hospitalization:

- First 72 days: Medicare pays $0.

- Days beyond 72: up to $75 per day for 60 days.

But he stayed 72 days, so only the first 72 are covered at $0.

Thus, Medicare pays $0 for hospitalization.

Convalescent home:345.

Visiting nurse:360.

Doctor's:1020.

Total Medicare:0+345=345; +360=705; +1020=1725.

So, total expenses 5829.

Ted pays 5829-1725=4104.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the visiting nurse's coverage is up to $20 per visit, but each visit is $12, so Medicare covers all, paying 360, and Ted pays 0.

Thus, total expenses:5829.

But none of the options have this total.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the convalescent home is 30 days, but the coverage is up to 20 days at $15 and 10 days at $4.50, so total coverage 345. So Ted pays 390-345=45.

So, total Ted's payments:45 (convalescent) + (hospital:3744) + (doctor:315) + visiting nurse:0.

Wait, but hospitalization's coverage is unclear.

If Medicare pays nothing for hospitalization, then Ted pays 3744.

Convalescent:45.

Doctor:315.

Total:3744+45=3789; +315=4104.

But again, not matching any options.

I'm stuck. Let me look at option E: total expenses 5985, Medicare 5243, Ted 742.

So, 5985-5243=742.

How to reach 5985.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the visiting nurse is 3 times a week for ten weeks, which is 3*10=30 visits, but each visit is $12, so 360.

But perhaps the problem includes a co-pay for the visiting nurse, but no, the coverage is up to $20 per visit, which covers the $12.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the convalescent home is 30 days at $13, but the coverage is up to 20 days at $15, so for days 21-30, it's $4.50.

So, coverage is 20*15=300 +10*4.50=45=345.

So, Ted pays 390-345=45.

Thus, Ted's payments:45 (convalescent) + (hospital:3744) + (doctor:315) + visiting nurse:0.

Total:3744+45=3789; +315=4104.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the convalescent home is 30 days, but the coverage is up to 20 days at $15, and beyond that, $4.50.

So, coverage is 345, as before.

Thus, Ted pays 45 for convalescent.

Hospitalization: perhaps Medicare pays 3744-72=3672.

Convalescent:345.

Visiting nurse:360.

Doctor's:1020.

Total Medicare:3672+345=3917; +360=4277; +1020=5297.

Which is close to option E's 5243.

But 5297 is higher than 5243.

Wait, perhaps the hospitalization coverage is that the first 72 days are covered at $75 per day, but that's not what the problem says.

Alternatively, perhaps the coverage for hospitalization is that the first 72 days are covered at $75 per day, but that's not correct.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the total expenses are 5829, but none of the options match. However, the closest option is E: total 5985, Medicare 5243, Ted 742.

Perhaps I made a mistake in the hospitalization coverage.

Wait, perhaps the coverage for hospitalization is:

- First 72 days: Medicare pays $0.

- Days 73-132: $75 per day.

- Days beyond 132: $34 per day.

But he stayed 72 days, so only the first 72 are covered at $0, so he pays 3744.

Convalescent home:345.

Visiting nurse:360.

Doctor's:1020.

Total Medicare:345+360+1020=1725.

Total expenses:3744+390=4134; +360=4494; +1335=5829.

So, Ted pays 5829-1725=4104.

But none of the options match.

I think I'll have to go with the option that has total expenses matching the sum of all individual expenses, which is 5829, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the convalescent home is 30 days, but the coverage is up to 20 days at $15, and beyond that, $4.50, so 20*15=300, 10*4.50=45, total 345.

Thus, Ted pays 390-345=45.

So, total Ted's payments:45 (convalescent) +3744 (hospital) +315 (doctor) +0 (visiting nurse)=4104.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the visiting nurse is 3 times a week for ten weeks, which is 30 visits, but each visit is $12, so 360.

But perhaps the coverage is up to $20 per visit, so Medicare covers all 360, and Ted pays 0.

Thus, total expenses:5829.

But none of the options have this.

I think I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the calculations, the closest option is E: total expenses 5985, Medicare pays 5243, Ted pays 742.

So, I'll go with E.
</think>

To determine Ted Logan's total medical expenses, Medicare coverage, and his out-of-pocket costs, we analyze each expense and apply the respective coverage rules:

### 1. **Hospitalization**
- **Duration:** 72 days
- **Cost per day:** $52
- **Total Cost:** \( 72 \times 52 = \$3,744 \)
- **Coverage:** 
  - First 72 days: $0 coverage (Medicare pays $0).
  - No further days beyond 72 are applicable.
- **Medicare Payment:** $0
- **Ted's Payment:** $3,744

### 2. **Convalescent Home**
- **Duration:** 30 days
- **Cost per day:** $13
- **Total Cost:** \( 30 \times 13 = \$390 \)
- **Coverage:**
  - Days 1-20: $15 per day (\( 20 \times 15 = \$300 \))
  - Days 21-30: $4.50 per day (\( 10 \times 4.50 = \$45 \))
  - **Total Coverage:** \( 300 + 45 = \$345 \)
- **Medicare Payment:** $345
- **Ted's Payment:** \( 390 - 345 = \$45 \)

### 3. **Visiting Nurse**
- **Visits:** 3 times a week for 10 weeks (\( 3 \times 10 = 30 \) visits)
- **Cost per visit:** $12
- **Total Cost:** \( 30 \times 12 = \$360 \)
- **Coverage:** Up to $20 per visit (\( 30 \times 20 = \$600 \))
  - Since the total cost is $360, Medicare covers the full amount.
- **Medicare Payment:** $360
- **Ted's Payment:** $0

### 4. **Doctor's Bills**
- **Total Cost:** $1,335
- **Coverage:** 80% of the first $1,275
  - **Medicare Payment:** \( 0.8 \times 1,275 = \$1,020 \)
- **Ted's Payment:** \( 1,335 - 1,020 = \$315 \)

### **Total Calculations**
- **Total Expenses:** \( 3,744 + 390 + 360 + 1,335 = \$5,829 \)
- **Total Medicare Payment:** \( 0 + 345 + 360 + 1,020 = \$1,725 \)
- **Total Ted's Payment:** \( 3,744 + 45 + 0 + 315 = \$4,104 \)

### **Matching the Options**
The calculated total expenses (\$5,829) do not match any option. However, the closest option is **E**, which assumes total expenses of \$5,985, Medicare payment of \$5,243, and Ted's payment of \$742. This discrepancy suggests either a miscalculation or an issue with the provided options.

### **Final Answer**
The most plausible choice based on the given options is:

**E: \$5,985, \$5,243, \$742**

E
