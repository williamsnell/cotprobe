Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the job characteristics model. I'm a bit rusty on my organizational psychology, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking which of the options is NOT a characteristic of the job characteristics model. The options are from A to I, and the choices include things like skill variety, job rotation, task significance, feedback, reward, task identity, autonomy, job enrichment, and job enlargement.

First, I need to recall what the job characteristics model entails. From what I remember, the model was developed by Hackman and Oldham. It focuses on five core job dimensions that lead to work outcomes like job satisfaction and performance. These dimensions are:

1. Skill Variety: The extent to which a job requires the use of different skills and talents.
2. Task Identity: The degree to which a job has a complete and whole task with a clear beginning and end.
3. Task Significance: The importance of the job's tasks in terms of their impact on the lives of other people.
4. Autonomy: The degree to which the job provides freedom, independence, and judgment regarding the methods to be used in performing the job.
5. Feedback: The degree to which performing the job provides the individual with clear and direct information about the effectiveness of their performance.

So, the five core dimensions are A, C, F, G, and D from the options given. Now, looking at the other options:

B: Job rotation – I think job rotation is a practice where employees move between different jobs or tasks to reduce boredom and increase skill variety. But I'm not sure if it's part of the job characteristics model itself. I think the model is more about the characteristics of the job, not the methods of redesigning jobs. So job rotation might be a strategy derived from the model, but not a characteristic itself.

E: Reward – The model talks about job outcomes, which include things like satisfaction and performance, but I don't recall reward being a core characteristic. Rewards are more related to other theories, like expectancy theory.

H: Job enrichment – Job enrichment is a concept related to redesigning jobs to include more of the five core dimensions. So job enrichment is a process that applies the model, not a characteristic of the model itself.

I: Job enlargement – This is similar to job rotation in that it's a way to redesign jobs, usually by increasing the number of tasks. It's about adding more tasks to a job to give employees more variety and responsibility. Again, this is a method of job design, not a characteristic of the model.

So, the question is asking which one is NOT a characteristic. The correct answer should be one of the options that isn't part of the five core dimensions.

Looking back, the options are:

A: Skill variety – yes, it's a core dimension.

B: Job rotation – not a core characteristic.

C: Task significance – yes.

D: Feedback – yes.

E: Reward – no, not a core dimension.

F: Task identity – yes.

G: Autonomy – yes.

H: Job enrichment – not a core characteristic.

I: Job enlargement – not a core characteristic.

Wait, so the options include E (Reward) and others like H and I. But the question is about what is NOT a characteristic. So among the options, which one is not part of the model.

Wait, the model's core characteristics are A, C, D, F, G. So any option outside these is not a characteristic.

So the options are:

A: yes

B: no

C: yes

D: yes

E: no

F: yes

G: yes

H: no

I: no

So the question is asking which is NOT a characteristic. So any of B, E, H, I would be correct. But the options given include E, H, I, etc.

Wait, but the options are A through I, and the question is which is NOT a characteristic.

Looking back at the options:

A: Skill variety – yes

B: Job rotation – no

C: Task significance – yes

D: Feedback – yes

E: Reward – no

F: Task identity – yes

G: Autonomy – yes

H: Job enrichment – no

I: Job enlargement – no

So the question is, which one is NOT a characteristic. So the options B, E, H, I are not characteristics.

But the question gives options A to I, and the correct answer is one of them.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing job characteristics model with job design methods. The job characteristics model identifies the five core dimensions, and job enrichment and enlargement are methods that use these dimensions.

So in the question, the options are:

B: Job rotation – is this part of the model? I think job rotation is a practice that might be related but isn't a core characteristic.

E: Reward – the model doesn't include reward as a core dimension.

H: Job enrichment – not a characteristic, it's an application.

I: Job enlargement – same as H.

So the question is, which is NOT a characteristic. So any of B, E, H, I.

But looking at the options, the possible answers are the ones that are not part of the five core dimensions.

Wait, but the question is about the job characteristics model, which focuses on the dimensions, not on the job redesign methods. So the answer would be any of the options that are not the five core dimensions.

So the options that are not part of the model are B, E, H, I.

Looking back at the options, the question is asking which is NOT a characteristic. So the answer could be any of these. But the options given in the question are A to I, so I need to pick one.

Wait, perhaps the options are presented as possible answers, and the correct answer is E: Reward.

Because the model doesn't include reward as a characteristic. The model's core dimensions are about the job itself, not about external rewards.

Alternatively, job rotation (B) is a job design technique, not a characteristic of the model.

Similarly, job enrichment (H) and job enlargement (I) are techniques based on the model but aren't characteristics.

So the options that are not characteristics are B, E, H, I.

But the question is asking for the one that is not a characteristic. So the answer could be any of these. But in the given options, the correct answer is likely E: Reward, because the model doesn't include reward as a core dimension.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes reward is considered a motivator, but in the model, the focus is on the job characteristics leading to intrinsic motivation.

So the model's outcomes include things like intrinsic satisfaction, but the core characteristics are the five dimensions, not reward.

Therefore, the answer is E: Reward.

The job characteristics model, developed by Hackman and Oldham, focuses on five core dimensions: skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, and feedback. These dimensions are intrinsic to the job and are designed to enhance motivation and satisfaction. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Skill variety** – This is a core dimension of the model.
- **B: Job rotation** – This is a job redesign method, not a characteristic of the model.
- **C: Task significance** – This is a core dimension.
- **D: Feedback** – This is a core dimension.
- **E: Reward** – The model does not include reward as a core characteristic; rewards are external and not part of the model's focus.
- **F: Task identity** – This is a core dimension.
- **G: Autonomy** – This is a core dimension.
- **H: Job enrichment** – This is a job redesign technique based on the model, not a characteristic.
- **I: Job enlargement** – This is another job redesign method, not a characteristic.

The question asks for the option that is NOT a characteristic of the model. While several options (B, E, H, I) fit this criterion, the most direct answer is **E: Reward**, as it is explicitly excluded from the model's core dimensions.

Answer: E
