Question:

A ceramics studio contracted with an artist to produce cups and saucers designed by the artist. The artist was an established designer of collectible ceramic dinnerware, and the studio did production work for many artists who created ceramic dinnerware. The price and quantity term of the contract read: "2,000 sets of the cups and saucers at $5 each, payable on delivery." The contract contained a merger clause. The studio produced the cups and saucers and delivered them along with a bill for $20,000 (4,000 pieces at $5 per piece). The artist refused to pay more than $10,000 (2,000 sets at $5 per set). At the trial of the studio's action against the artist for breach of contract, the studio introduced evidence of an established practice in the studio industry to price cup-and-saucer sets on a per-piece, not a per-set, basis. Is the studio's evidence admissible?

Options:

A: No, because such evidence would vary an unambiguous term of the contract.
B: No, because the evidence would contradict the explicit terms of the contract.
C: Yes, because evidence of trade usage is always admissible.
D: Yes, because the usage of trade is offered to give meaning to the contract.
E: No, because the contract contained a merger clause which makes extrinsic evidence inadmissible.
F: Yes, because the studio's interpretation of the contract aligns with the industry practice.
G: Yes, because the court should consider industry norms in interpreting the contract.
H: No, because the agreement was completely integrated.
I: No, because the artist was unaware of the industry practice.
J: Yes, because the evidence of established industry practice may explain the ambiguity in the contract.

Okay, so I've got this contracts question here, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. Let me read through it carefully and break it down.

The scenario is about a ceramics studio that contracted with an artist to produce cups and saucers. The artist is an established designer of collectible ceramic dinnerware, and the studio does production work for many artists. The contract's terms say: "2,000 sets of the cups and saucers at $5 each, payable on delivery." The studio produced and delivered the items, sending a bill for $20,000, which is 4,000 pieces at $5 each. But the artist only wants to pay $10,000, which is 2,000 sets at $5 per set. So the artist is interpreting the price as per set, while the studio is billing per piece.

At the trial, the studio introduced evidence about an established industry practice where cup-and-saucer sets are priced on a per-piece basis, not per set. The question is whether this evidence is admissible.

The options are from A to J, each giving a different reasoning.

First, I need to recall the rules about contract interpretation and evidence. When a contract is unambiguous, extrinsic evidence (like prior agreements, industry practices) isn't admissible to vary its terms. But if there's an ambiguity, such evidence can be used to clarify what the parties intended.

The contract term here is "2,000 sets ... at $5 each." The issue is whether "each" refers to each set or each piece. If the contract is clear, then extrinsic evidence can't change it. But if it's ambiguous, such evidence is allowed.

In this case, the studio is trying to show that in the industry, sets are priced per piece, so each in the contract refers to each piece. The artist thinks each is each set. So the contract could be ambiguous because "each" isn't clear. Therefore, the studio's evidence about industry practice would help interpret the contract.

Looking at the options:

A: No, because it varies an unambiguous term. But the term isn't necessarily unambiguous. So A might not be correct.

B: No, because it contradicts explicit terms. Again, if the contract is explicit, but if it's ambiguous, then it's not necessarily contradicting.

C: Yes, because trade usage is always admissible. But I think it's only admissible if there's an ambiguity. So C might be too broad.

D: Yes, because it's offered to give meaning to the contract. That sounds right because the evidence is to clarify the meaning.

E: No, because of the merger clause. A merger clause (like a no-oral-modification clause) doesn't prevent extrinsic evidence from being used to interpret the contract, just to modify it. So E is probably wrong.

F: Yes, because the studio's interpretation aligns with industry practice. This is similar to D but more about alignment. The reasoning in D seems better.

G: Yes, because the court should consider industry norms. Courts usually don't consider industry norms unless they help resolve ambiguity. So G is possible.

H: No, because the agreement was completely integrated. Integration (like a merger clause) doesn't bar evidence for interpretation, just for modification.

I: No, because the artist didn't know the practice. The artist's lack of knowledge doesn't make the evidence inadmissible; industry practices can still be used.

J: Yes, because it may explain the ambiguity. This seems correct because the evidence would show how the term is typically understood in the industry, which could resolve the ambiguity.

So the key is whether the contract is ambiguous. Since "each" could mean each set or each piece, there's an ambiguity. Therefore, evidence of industry practice is admissible to interpret it. So D and J seem possible. D says it's offered to give meaning; J says it explains the ambiguity.

I think J is better because it directly addresses the ambiguity point.
</think>

The question revolves around whether the studio's evidence of industry practice is admissible to interpret the contract term "at $5 each." The contract is ambiguous because "each" could refer to each set or each piece. Since ambiguity exists, evidence of industry practice is admissible to clarify the intended meaning. 

Answer: J
