Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this accounting question. Let me read it again carefully.

The company is preparing its IFRS financial statements for the first time, which is the year ended December 31, year 2. While doing this, they found an error in which a $90,000 loss wasn't recorded. Out of this, $40,000 relates to a year 1 event and $50,000 to a year 2 event. The question is asking what amount of loss accrual should be reported in the December 31, year 1, IFRS statement of financial position.

Hmm, so I think this is about adjusting prior periods when an error is found. IFRS has some rules about this, right? I remember that if an error is discovered in a prior period, the company should adjust the prior period's financial statements. But wait, when they're in the first year of IFRS reporting, how does that affect things?

Wait, the company's first IFRS period is year 2. So prior to that, they were using another accounting standard, maybe GAAP or something else. But when they switch to IFRS, they have to present the first IFRS year as year 2. But what about prior periods? I think under IFRS, when a company changes accounting standards, they sometimes have to restate prior periods if it's a comparative presentation. But since this is the first year of IFRS, they might not have prior IFRS statements, so maybe they only present the current year and the prior year under IFRS.

Wait, the problem says that the error was identified while preparing the year 2 statement. So the year 2 is their first IFRS year. They didn't correct prior periods in IFRS yet because they just started. So any prior period adjustments would be for the year 1 as per IFRS.

But the error is about a $90k loss not being recorded. Of that, $40k was from year 1, and $50k from year 2. So in their initial books for year 1 (non-IFRS), they didn't record a $40k loss, and for year 2, a $50k loss wasn't recorded.

Now, when they're preparing the IFRS statements for year 2, they need to correct the prior period. So for the year 1 IFRS statement, which would be the restated year 1 under IFRS, they have to adjust for the $40k loss that was previously omitted.

Wait, but when a company converts to IFRS, they might have to restate the prior period. So in this case, the year 1 would be restated to include the $40k loss that was not previously recorded under their old GAAP or whatever. So in the year 1 IFRS statement, they need to include that $40k loss. But what about the year 2? Well, since they're preparing the year 2 statement, they have to correct the $50k loss for year 2 as well.

But the question is specifically asking about the December 31, year 1 statement. So looking at that, how much loss should they report?

In the original books, year 1 didn't have the $40k loss. So when restating, they need to add that $40k loss to year 1. So the year 1 statement of financial position (balance sheet) would show an increase in the loss, which would affect retained earnings. But since the question is about the amount to report, it's about the corrected figure.

Wait, but wait. The initial statement for year 1 (before correction) didn't have the $40k loss. When they correct it, they should adjust the prior year's statement. So in the IFRS year 2 financial statements, they would present the restated year 1 and the current year 2.

So for the year 1, the loss that should have been recorded is $40k. Therefore, in the December 31, year 1, IFRS statement, the loss would be $40k. But wait, the options don't have $40k as part of the current period's loss, but maybe it's about the prior period.

Wait, no, the balance sheet for year 1 under IFRS would include the corrected $40k loss. So the correct amount to report is $40k. Looking at the options, option I is $40k. But wait, let me think again.

Wait, no. The question says the company's first IFRS period is year 2. So when they prepare the year 2 statements, they might not have a restated year 1 IFRS statement because it's the first year. Instead, they have to correct the prior periods when possible. But if the prior period was under a different standard, how does that work?

I think in this case, the company is required to correct the prior period's financial statements for the error. So in their year 2 IFRS financial statements, they have to present restated year 1 figures if they're comparable. So for year 1, the $40k loss was not recorded, so they have to add that to year 1's income statement. Therefore, in the year 1 IFRS statement, the loss would be $40k, right?

But wait, the question is about the December 31, year 1 statement. So in that statement, they have to show the corrected figures. So the correct answer should be $40k, which is option I.

The company identified an error where a $90,000 loss was not recorded, with $40,000 relating to year 1 and $50,000 to year 2. Since the company is now under IFRS for the first time in year 2, it must correct prior periods if they are comparable. Therefore, the $40,000 loss from year 1 must be added to the year 1 financial statements. The correct amount to report is $40,000.
