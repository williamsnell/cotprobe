Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about business cycles. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking which statement correctly describes business cycles. The options are A through J. I remember that business cycles are a concept in economics that describe the fluctuation of the economy between periods of growth and periods of decline. They typically involve expansions and recessions.

Let me go through each option:

A: Are the natural fluctuations in the price of goods and services. Hmm, wait, business cycles are about economic activity, like GDP growth, not just prices. Prices might fluctuate, but that's more about inflation or supply and demand, not the overall business cycle. So maybe A isn't correct.

B: Only occur in developing economies. No, business cycles happen in all types of economies, developing or developed. For example, the 2008 crisis affected many developed countries. So B is probably incorrect.

C: Are always triggered by a financial crisis. I don't think that's true. While financial crises can cause recessions, business cycles can also happen due to other factors like changes in consumer confidence, monetary policy, or external shocks. So C is not necessarily correct.

D: Are the result of governmental fiscal policy. Fiscal policy can influence the economy, but business cycles are more about the inherent fluctuations, not solely caused by fiscal policies. So D might not be the best answer.

E: Are steady and consistent changes in economic activity. Steady changes don't sound like business cycles because they involve upswings and downswings, not just steady trends. So E is probably wrong.

F: Are predictable ups and downs in economic activity. I'm not sure. Business cycles have phases like expansion, peak, contraction, and trough, but are they predictable? I think they're somewhat cyclical but not entirely predictable. Economists try to predict them, but it's not exact. So F might not be correct.

G: Occur infrequently in capitalist economies. No, business cycles happen regularly in capitalist economies. So G is incorrect.

H: Refer to reusing resources in production. That sounds more like resource management or recycling, not business cycles. So H is off.

I: Are each comprised of a recession and an expansion. Wait, business cycles include both expansions (periods of growth) and recessions (periods of decline). So each cycle has both. But I think a full cycle includes more phases, like expansion, peak, contraction, and trough. So I's description is a bit simplified but could be correct. However, I'm not sure if it's the best option.

J: Refer to the cycle of a business from startup to maturity. That sounds more like the life cycle of a single business, not the overall economy's business cycle. So J is incorrect.

Wait, let me reconsider option F. The statement says business cycles are predictable ups and downs. I think business cycles do involve ups and downs, but whether they're predictable is another matter. Economists use models to predict, but it's not always accurate. So F might not be the best answer.

Looking back at option I: Are each comprised of a recession and an expansion. That seems accurate because a business cycle does involve periods of expansion followed by contraction, which includes recessions. So I think I is correct.

Alternatively, let me check if any other options match better. Option F says "predictable," which I'm not sure about. Option I correctly identifies the components as expansions and contractions (recession). So I think I is the correct answer.

The correct answer is I.

I: are each comprised of a recession and an expansion.

The business cycle includes both expansions and recessions, making option I accurate.

Answer: I
