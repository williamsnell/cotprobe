Okay, so I've got this problem here where Bill is depositing $1,000 for 4 years at 5% interest, compounded annually. I need to find the accumulated value. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on compound interest, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that compound interest means the interest is calculated on the initial principal and also on the accumulated interest from previous periods. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- P is the principal amount ($1,000 in this case).
- r is the annual interest rate (5%, so that's 0.05 as a decimal).
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year. Since it's compounded annually, n is 1.
- t is the time the money is invested for in years (4 years here).

So plugging in the numbers, the formula becomes A = 1000(1 + 0.05/1)^(1*4). Simplifying that, it's 1000*(1.05)^4.

Now, I need to calculate (1.05)^4. Let me break that down. 1.05 squared is 1.1025. Then, squaring that again (since 1.05^4 is (1.05^2)^2), so 1.1025 squared. Let me compute that:

1.1025 * 1.1025. Hmm, let's see. 1 * 1.1025 is 1.1025. 0.1025 * 1.1025... Wait, maybe it's easier to multiply step by step.

Alternatively, I can compute 1.1025 * 1.1025:
- 1 * 1 = 1
- 1 * 0.1025 = 0.1025
- 0.1025 * 1 = 0.1025
- 0.1025 * 0.1025 = approximately 0.01050625

Adding them up: 1 + 0.1025 + 0.1025 + 0.01050625 = 1.21550625.

Wait, that seems a bit off because when I multiply 1.1025 by itself, I should get 1.21550625. So (1.05)^4 is approximately 1.21550625.

Now, multiplying that by the principal amount of $1,000: 1000 * 1.21550625 = $1,215.50625.

Looking at the options, I see option E is $1,215.50, which matches closely. But wait, let me double-check the calculation to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute it year by year to confirm.

Year 1: 1000 * 1.05 = 1050.
Year 2: 1050 * 1.05 = 1102.50.
Year 3: 1102.50 * 1.05. Let's calculate that: 1102.50 * 1.05 = 1157.625.
Year 4: 1157.625 * 1.05. So 1157.625 * 1.05. Let me compute that:
1157.625 * 1 = 1157.625
1157.625 * 0.05 = 57.88125
Adding them together: 1157.625 + 57.88125 = 1215.50625.

So after 4 years, the amount is $1,215.50625, which rounds to $1,215.51. Wait, but looking at the options, E is $1,215.50 and C is $1,215.51. So which one is correct?

Wait, the exact value is $1,215.50625, which is approximately $1,215.51. So option C is $1,215.51, which would be the correct answer. But wait, the options have E as $1,215.50 and C as $1,215.51. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, let me check my step-by-step calculation again. Let me compute each year's amount precisely.

Year 1: $1,000 * 1.05 = $1,050. Correct.
Year 2: $1,050 * 1.05 = $1,102.50. Correct.
Year 3: $1,102.50 * 1.05. Let's compute this:

1102.50 * 1.05:
1102.50 * 1 = 1102.50
1102.50 * 0.05 = 55.125
Total: 1102.50 + 55.125 = 1157.625. So $1,157.625.

Year 4: 1157.625 * 1.05.

1157.625 * 1 = 1157.625
1157.625 * 0.05 = 57.88125
Adding together: 1157.625 + 57.88125 = 1215.50625.

So $1,215.50625, which is $1,215.51 when rounded to the nearest cent. Therefore, the accumulated value is $1,215.51, which is option C.

Wait, but the options have E as $1,215.50 and C as $1,215.51. So the correct answer should be C.

But wait, looking back at the initial formula, sometimes the calculation might be done with more precise decimal places. Let me check if (1.05)^4 is exactly 1.21550625. Yes, because 1.05^4 is 1.21550625.

So 1000 * 1.21550625 = 1215.50625, which is $1,215.51 when rounded to the nearest cent.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: $1,215.51.
</think>

The accumulated value after 4 years with annual compounding at 5% is calculated using the formula A = P(1 + r)^t. Plugging in the values, A = 1000*(1.05)^4 = $1,215.51.

Answer: C
