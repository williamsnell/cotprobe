Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular weight of a new compound. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand it.

The chemist took 2.00 grams of the unknown compound and dissolved it in 10 grams of water. This caused the freezing point of the water to drop to -1.22°C. I remember that when a solute is dissolved in a solvent, it causes a depression in the freezing point, and this can be used to find the molecular weight of the solute using the freezing point depression formula.

Right, the formula I think I need is ΔT = Kf * m, where ΔT is the change in freezing point, Kf is the freezing point depression constant for the solvent, and m is the molality of the solution. 

First, I should find the ΔT. The normal freezing point of water is 0°C, and it's now -1.22°C. So ΔT = 0 - (-1.22) = 1.22°C. Wait, no, wait. Actually, the freezing point depression is the difference between the normal and the depressed temperature, so it's 0 - (-1.22) = +1.22°C. Yeah, that makes sense because the temperature is lower, so the depression is positive.

Next, I need the Kf for water. I recall that the Kf for water is 1.86°C·kg/mol. Yeah, I've used that before in similar problems.

Now, I can rearrange the formula to solve for molality (m). So m = ΔT / Kf. Plugging in the numbers: m = 1.22°C / 1.86°C·kg/mol. Let me calculate that. 1.22 divided by 1.86 is approximately 0.6564 mol/kg. Hmm, wait, 1.22/1.86, let me do this more accurately. 1.86 goes into 1.22 about 0.656 times, yeah.

But wait, I should double-check that calculation. 1.86 times 0.6 is 1.116, and 1.86 times 0.65 is 1.209. Hmm, so 1.22 minus 1.209 is 0.011. So 0.65 plus (0.011/1.86) which is about 0.006. So approximately 0.656 mol/kg. So m ≈ 0.656 mol/kg.

Now, molality is moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. The solvent here is water, and the mass given is 10 grams. Oh wait, 10 grams is 0.010 kg. So the molality m = moles / 0.010 kg. Wait, no, wait. No, molality is moles per kg of solvent. Here, the solvent is 10 grams, which is 0.010 kg. So m = (moles) / 0.010 kg = 0.656 mol/kg → moles = m * 0.010 kg.

Wait, no, let's correct that. The formula for molality is moles of solute divided by kg of solvent. So m = (n)/(mass of solvent in kg). So rearranged, n = m * mass of solvent in kg. So n = 0.656 mol/kg * 0.010 kg = 0.00656 mol. So the number of moles is approximately 0.00656.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. The molality m is 0.656 mol/kg. The mass of the solvent is 10 grams, which is 0.010 kg. So moles = m * kg of solvent = 0.656 * 0.010 = 0.00656 moles. That seems right.

Now, the problem says that the mass of the solute is 2.00 grams. So, the molecular weight (molar mass) M is mass divided by moles. So M = mass / n = 2.00 g / 0.00656 mol.

Let me calculate that. 2.00 divided by 0.00656. Hmm, let me do this step by step. 0.00656 is approximately 6.56e-3. So 2 / 0.00656 is the same as 2 * (1/0.00656). Let's compute 1/0.00656.

Well, 0.00656 is 6.56 x 10^-3. The reciprocal of 6.56e-3 is approximately 152.4. Because 6.56 * 152 = approx 1000 (since 6.56 * 152 = 6.56*(150+2) = 984 + 13.12= 997.12, which is close to 1000). So 1/0.00656 ≈ 152.4. So 2.00 * 152.4 ≈ 304.8 g/mol.

Looking at the options, option C is 305 g/mol, which is very close to my calculation. Let me check if I made any miscalculations.

Wait, let's go back. Maybe I should compute 1.22 divided by 1.86 more accurately. Let me do that.

1.22 ÷ 1.86. Let's see:

1.86 × 0.6 = 1.116

1.22 - 1.116 = 0.104

Now, 0.104 ÷ 1.86. 1.86 × 0.05 = 0.093, so 0.05 brings us to 0.093.

0.104 - 0.093 = 0.011.

Now, 0.011 ÷ 1.86 ≈ 0.00591.

So total is 0.6 + 0.05 + 0.00591 ≈ 0.65591, which is about 0.6559 mol/kg.

So m = 0.6559 mol/kg.

Then, moles = 0.6559 * 0.010 kg = 0.006559 mol.

Mass is 2.00 g, so M = 2.00 / 0.006559 ≈ 304.8 g/mol.

Yes, that checks out. So the closest option is C: 305 g/mol.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any other mistakes. For example, using the correct Kf value. Yes, Kf for water is indeed 1.86°C·kg/mol. Also, the mass of the solvent is 10 grams, which is 0.010 kg, so that's correct. The mass of the solute is 2.00 grams, correct.

Another thing to check: is the formula correctly applied? Yes, ΔT = Kf * m, and m = (moles)/(kg solvent). So yes, the approach is correct.
</think>

The chemist used the freezing point depression formula, ΔT = Kf * m, to determine the molecular weight of the unknown compound. The freezing point depression (ΔT) was calculated as 1.22°C, and the freezing point depression constant for water (Kf) is 1.86°C·kg/mol. Using these values, the molality (m) was found to be approximately 0.656 mol/kg. Since molality is moles of solute per kilogram of solvent, the moles of solute were calculated as 0.00656 mol. Given that the mass of the solute is 2.00 g, the molecular weight (M) was determined by dividing the mass by the number of moles: M = 2.00 g / 0.00656 mol ≈ 304.8 g/mol. The closest option is **C: 305 g/mol**.
