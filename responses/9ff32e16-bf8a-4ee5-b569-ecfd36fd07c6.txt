Okay, I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this question about the characteristics of a programmed decision. Let me start by recalling what I know about programmed decisions and their characteristics.

A programmed decision is one that is predetermined and follows a specific set of rules or procedures. I remember that these decisions are usually made by humans, like in business settings, law, or everyday life. The key thing about them is that they are not randomâ€”they don't depend on chance.

Now, looking at the options, I need to choose the one that best describes what a programmed decision entails. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Uncertain and low risk. Hmm, programmed decisions are systematic and follow a pattern, so they aren't uncertain. Plus, since they are based on structured rules, the risk is low. So A might be correct, but let me check the other options.

Option B: Non-routine and complex. Non-routine means it's not a straightforward decision, but I think programmed decisions are routine because they follow a set of steps. Also, they're not complex in the sense of being difficult, but more structured. So B seems incorrect.

Option C: Low risk and certain. Wait, programmed decisions are certain because they follow a logical path. But they're not entirely certain if there are unforeseen circumstances. So while the risk is low, the decision isn't 'certain' in a absolute sense. Hmm, this might not be the best fit.

Option D: High risk and uncertain. No, that's the opposite. Programmed decisions have low risk because they're based on established procedures.

Option E: Uncertain and non-routine. This doesn't make sense. Programmed decisions are routine, so option E is incorrect.

Option F: Risky and routine. Again, programmed decisions are routine, not risky.

Option G: Complex and risky. No, these are the opposite of what programmed decisions are.

Option H: Certain and complex. Programmed decisions are certain, but they're not complex; they're structured.

Option I: Complex and certain. No, they're certain but not complex.

Option J: Routine and non-complex. This seems a bit off. The question is about characteristics, so routine is correct, but non-complex might be a bit vague. I think the main point is that programmed decisions are certain, as they follow rules. So perhaps the correct answer is C, which says low risk and certain. Wait, but option C says 'low risk and certain', which might not capture the 'certain' part as strictly as 'certain' in another option. Wait, option I says 'complex and certain' but that's incorrect.

Wait, let me think again. A programmed decision is deterministic, meaning it follows a specific set of steps, so it's not uncertain. So the decision is certain because it's based on predetermined rules. So the characteristics are low risk and certain. So option C is correct. But I also remember that programmed decisions are usually routine, so option B is incorrect.

Wait, but the options are about the characteristics, not the type of decision. So the question is about what makes a decision programmed. So the characteristics would be that it's certain and follows a routine set of steps, leading to low risk.

Looking back at the options, option C is 'Low risk and certain'. Option I is 'Complex and certain', which is incorrect because they're not complex. So option C seems correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me try to remember: programmed decisions are systematic, so they are certain, low risk, and follow a routine path. So the correct option would be C, which says low risk and certain. Alternatively, option H is 'Certain and complex', which is wrong.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Programmed decisions are routine, so they are not non-routine. So option B is incorrect because it says non-routine. So the correct answer should be C: Low risk and certain.

Alternatively, option H says 'Certain and complex'. But programmed decisions are not complex, as they are structured. So option H is wrong.

Wait, another way to think: a programmed decision is deterministic, so it's not uncertain. So the decision is certain. So the characteristics are low risk and certain. So option C is correct.

The correct answer is C: Low risk and certain. 

A programmed decision is structured and follows a specific set of rules, making it certain and not uncertain. It also has low risk because it is based on predetermined procedures. While the decision is deterministic, it is not complex. Therefore, option C accurately describes the characteristics of a programmed decision. 

Answer: C
