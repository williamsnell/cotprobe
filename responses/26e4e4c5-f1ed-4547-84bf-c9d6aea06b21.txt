Question:

Two weeks before an election, a local newspaper published an article implying that one of the mayoral candidates was a thief. The candidate subsequently lost the election and sued the newspaper for defamation. The newspaper defended on the grounds of truth. At trial, the candidate took the stand and testified that he was not a thief. Thereafter, the newspaper called a witness to testify that three years ago the candidate committed a larceny while employed at his former job. Upon objection by the candidate's attorney, the witness's testimony should be

Options:

A: excluded, as it can potentially bias the jury.
B: excluded, because it is hearsay evidence.
C: admitted, as it supports the newspaper's defense of truth.
D: excluded, because it is improper character evidence.
E: admitted as relevant evidence of the candidate's character as a thief.
F: excluded, because the act was committed too long ago to be relevant.
G: admitted as probative evidence of the candidate's character for veracity.
H: admitted, as it is relevant to the candidate's credibility.
I: admitted, but only if the witness can provide conclusive proof of the larceny.
J: excluded, because bad acts may not be proved by extrinsic evidence.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this defamation question. Let me break it down step by step. So, the scenario is that two weeks before an election, a newspaper published an article suggesting the mayoral candidate was a thief. The candidate lost and sued for defamation. The newspaper is defending on the grounds of truth. At trial, the candidate testified he wasn't a thief. Then, the newspaper called a witness to testify that three years ago, the candidate committed larceny at his former job. The candidate's attorney objected, and we need to decide what should happen to the witness's testimony.

First, I remember that in defamation cases, the defendant can use the defense of truth. If they prove the statement was true, it's a complete defense. So, the newspaper is trying to show the truth of their article by presenting evidence that the candidate was indeed a thief.

The candidate testified he wasn't a thief, so the newspaper is countering with evidence that he is. The key here is whether the evidence of the larceny is admissible.

I think about the rules of evidence, especially regarding character evidence. I recall that in criminal cases, a defendant's character can be attacked with evidence of specific acts, but in civil cases, like defamation, it's a bit different. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Defamation is a tort, so it's under civil procedure, but the rules of evidence still apply.

Wait, in defamation, if the plaintiff is a public figure, the standard is actual malice. But here, it's a mayoral candidate, so possibly a limited-purpose public figure. But regardless, the newspaper's defense is truth, so they need to prove the truth of their statement that he's a thief.

So, the question is, can they introduce evidence of a prior theft (larceny) to support their claim that he is a thief? Larceny is a specific act of theft.

I think about the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 405. Rule 405(a) says that when evidence of a person's character or character trait is admissible, it can be proved by testimony about reputation or opinion. Rule 405(b) allows specific instances of conduct only if they're relevant to prove some fact, like if the person's character is directly at issue.

In a defamation case, the plaintiff's good character might be relevant to establish that the defamatory statement was harmful. But here, the newspaper is trying to prove the truth of the statement by showing he actually committed theft.

So, the defense is truth, and to prove that, they need to show he is a thief. So, they can introduce evidence of specific acts of theft to prove he is a thief. But wait, in a defamation case, is the plaintiff's character directly at issue? I think so because the harm in defamation often relates to the plaintiff's reputation.

But wait, under the rules, when a person's character is at issue, you can use reputation or opinion, but specific acts are only allowed if they're relevant to prove a fact, not just to show bad character. So, in this case, the newspaper is trying to prove the truth of their statement, which would involve showing the candidate's character as a thief. So, maybe they can introduce specific acts of larceny because it's directly about his character for theft.

But wait, another angle: the candidate is suing for defamation. The defamation is about being a thief. The newspaper is saying it's true. So, they need to prove he is a thief. If they can prove he committed larceny, that supports their case. So, the witness's testimony about the larceny would be relevant to show he is a thief, making the article truthful.

But then, is there any rule against using extrinsic evidence of specific acts to prove a person's character? I think Rule 608 deals with specific instances of a person's conduct for character evidence, but that's for impeachment. Rule 405(b) allows specific instances only if they are relevant to prove a fact, not just to show bad character.

Wait, no, Rule 405(b) says that specific instances of conduct are not admissible to prove a person's character, but they can be used if they're relevant to prove some other fact. So, in this case, the newspaper is trying to prove the truth of their statement, which is that the candidate is a thief. So, the specific act of larceny is relevant to that.

Alternatively, maybe the defense is that the evidence is irrelevant or inadmissible as character evidence. But I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The newspaper is trying to prove the truth of their statement. The statement is that the candidate is a thief. So, to prove that, they need to show that he has committed acts of theft. A prior larceny is a specific act of theft, so it's directly relevant.

But wait, in some cases, evidence of past crimes can be used to impeach a witness, but here, the candidate is testifying, so maybe that's another issue. But the newspaper is introducing evidence to prove the truth of their statement, not to impeach.

So, the witness's testimony about the larceny is being offered to prove that the candidate is a thief, making the newspaper's statement true. So, it's not about the candidate's credibility in general but about the truth of the statement.

Wait, but under the rules, when a person's character is relevant, such as in a defamation case where their reputation is at issue, you can use specific acts under 405(b) only if they are relevant to prove a fact, not just to show bad character.

So, in this case, the specific act of larceny is relevant to prove that the candidate has the character trait of being a thief. Therefore, it's admissible under 405(b) because it's relevant to prove the fact at issue (that he's a thief).

Wait, but another point: the act happened three years ago. Is it too remote? Generally, evidence is not excluded for remoteness unless it's so old that it's irrelevant. Three years is not that long, and it's directly relevant to his character.

Alternatively, some might argue that it's improper character evidence because it's being used to prove the truth of the statement, which is a defense. So, maybe the evidence is admissible as it goes to the truth of the matter asserted.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Admitted as it supports the defense of truth.

Option E: Admitted as relevant to character.

Option J: Excluded because bad acts may not be proved by extrinsic evidence.

Wait, but can extrinsic evidence be used? Rule 608 allows extrinsic evidence of specific instances of conduct for certain purposes, like impeachment. But in this case, the newspaper is trying to prove the truth of their statement by showing he did it.

Another angle: The candidate's attorney is objecting when the newspaper calls a witness to testify about the larceny. The objection is likely on the grounds of hearsay or improper character evidence.

Wait, but the witness is testifying about the candidate's past act, not hearsay. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered for truth. Here, the witness is testifying about what they know about the candidate's past act, which is not hearsay because it's their own knowledge (assuming the witness has personal knowledge).

So, it's not hearsay. So option B is incorrect.

Option J says excluded because bad acts may not be proved by extrinsic evidence. Wait, Rule 608 says that specific instances of conduct are not admissible to prove character, but they can be used for impeachment. So, in this case, the newspaper is trying to prove the candidate's character as a thief, so it's using specific acts. But under 405(b), specific acts are only admissible if they're relevant to prove a fact, not just to show bad character.

Wait, maybe the issue is that in defamation cases, the plaintiff's character is not generally admissible unless the plaintiff has put their character at issue. The plaintiff here sued for defamation, which is about harm to reputation. So, the plaintiff's good character is relevant, but the defendant can then bring up specific acts to show the truth.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: in a defamation case, the defendant's defense of truth would require them to prove the truth of the statement. If the statement is that the plaintiff is a thief, the defendant can prove that by showing specific instances of theft, including this larceny.

So, the witness's testimony is relevant and admissible to support the defense of truth.

So, looking at the options, option C is admitted as it supports the defense of truth.

But wait, another thought: in some jurisdictions, specific acts may not be admissible unless they're relevant beyond just proving character. For example, if the plaintiff is a public figure, maybe the defendant can't just bring up any old theft to prove the statement. But here, it's a mayoral candidate, so possibly a limited-purpose public figure, but the defense would still be truth.

Alternatively, maybe the evidence is being offered to show the candidate's character, which is not the best way to prove the truth of the statement. Because the truth is about whether he is a thief, which could be shown by direct evidence, like a conviction or specific acts.

Wait, but the candidate is a public figure, so the standard is actual malice. The newspaper must show that the statement was true, which would require proof beyond a reasonable doubt. But that's more about the burden of proof, not the admissibility of the evidence.

So, coming back, the witness's testimony about the larceny is being offered to prove the candidate is a thief, which supports the newspaper's defense of truth. Therefore, it's relevant and admissible.

Looking at the options again:

C: admitted, as it supports the newspaper's defense of truth.

E: admitted as relevant evidence of the candidate's character as a thief.

Wait, both C and E seem similar. But C is about supporting the defense of truth, while E is about character.

I think the correct reasoning is that the evidence is relevant to proving the truth of the statement, so it's admissible under the defense of truth. Therefore, option C.

But wait, another angle: in criminal cases, specific acts can't be used to prove character, but in civil cases, maybe they can. Or is it the other way around? I think in civil cases, specific instances of conduct are allowed if they're relevant to a material issue.

So, in this case, the material issue is whether the candidate is a thief, which is directly at issue because the defamation is about that. Therefore, the evidence is admissible under Rule 405(b) because it's relevant to prove the candidate's character as a thief.

So, both C and E could be considered, but the difference is that C is about the defense of truth, while E is about character.

Wait, the newspaper is using the evidence to prove the truth of their statement, which is that he's a thief. So, the relevance is to the truth of the matter asserted, not just his character.

So, perhaps the better answer is C: admitted as it supports the defense of truth.

Alternatively, option E says admitted as relevant to the candidate's character as a thief. That's also correct because the evidence is about his character.

Wait, but the newspaper is trying to prove the truth of the statement, which is that he is a thief. So, the evidence is relevant to the truth, which is the defense.

So, perhaps both C and E are correct, but looking at the options, C is more about the defense, while E is about character. I think the correct answer is C because it's about supporting the defense, but I'm a bit torn.

Wait, another thought: in a defamation case, the plaintiff's character is at issue because the harm is to their reputation. So, the defendant can introduce evidence to show the truth of the statement, which goes to the plaintiff's character. Therefore, the evidence is admissible as relevant to the plaintiff's character, making option E correct.

But I'm not entirely sure. I think I might have to choose between C and E.

Wait, the defense is truth, so the newspaper is trying to prove the statement is true. The statement is that he's a thief. So, the evidence of larceny is directly about the truth of that statement. Therefore, it's admitted to support the defense of truth, which is option C.

Alternatively, the evidence is about his character, so it's admitted as relevant to his character, which is option E.

I think in this context, since the defense is truth, the relevance is to the truth of the statement, making option C correct. But I'm not 100% confident. However, I think the correct answer is C.

The question revolves around the admissibility of evidence in a defamation case where the newspaper seeks to prove the truth of its statement by introducing evidence of a prior act of larceny committed by the candidate. The key issue is whether the witness's testimony about the larceny is admissible under the rules of evidence.

1. **Defamation and Defense of Truth**: The newspaper's defense is truth, meaning they must prove the statement that the candidate is a thief. This requires evidence showing the candidate's character as a thief.

2. **Relevance of Specific Acts**: Under Federal Rule of Evidence 405(b), specific instances of conduct are admissible if they are relevant to prove a fact at issue. Here, the larceny is directly relevant to proving the candidate's character as a thief, which is central to the defense of truth.

3. **Exclusionary Rules**: The testimony is not hearsay because the witness is testifying based on personal knowledge. It is also not excluded as improper character evidence because the evidence is relevant to the truth of the statement, not merely to impeach the candidate's credibility.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option C**: Admitted as it supports the newspaper's defense of truth. This is correct because the evidence directly supports the truth of the statement.
   - **Option E**: Admitted as relevant evidence of the candidate's character as a thief. While this is also correct, the focus here is on the defense of truth, making Option C the better choice.

Given the above reasoning, the testimony should be admitted to support the newspaper's defense of truth.

**Answer: C**
