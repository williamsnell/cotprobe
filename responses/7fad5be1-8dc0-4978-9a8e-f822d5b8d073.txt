Okay, so I've got this question about a plastics company's waste cost. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The problem says that the cost of waste is fixed at $12 for up to 20 modules. That means if they produce 20 modules or fewer, the waste cost is just $12. But if they produce more than 20, the waste cost increases based on a function. The function given is $4 times (p minus 20) squared, where p is the number of modules in excess of 20. So, if they make 25 modules, p would be 5 because 25 minus 20 is 5. 

The question has two parts: (i) what's the total waste cost when producing 45 modules, and (ii) what number of modules minimizes the waste cost. 

Let me tackle part (i) first. Since 45 modules are more than 20, I need to use the formula. So p is 45 minus 20, which is 25. Then I plug that into the formula: 4*(25)^2. 

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. The formula is 4*(p-20)^2, but p is modules in excess of 20. So p is 45-20=25. So the waste cost after 20 is 4*(25)^2. Let me compute that. 25 squared is 625, times 4 is 2500. Then, add the fixed cost of $12. So total waste cost is 2500 +12= $2512. 

Wait, but looking at the options, I see option E is $2512 and 20 modules. But wait, part (ii) is about minimizing waste cost. So perhaps I should also think about part (ii) to see if the numbers make sense.

For part (ii), to minimize the waste cost. The cost function is fixed at $12 up to 20 modules. Beyond 20, it's 4*(p-20)^2 plus the fixed $12. Hmm, but wait, actually, the fixed cost is $12 regardless of whether you produce more. So the variable part is 4*(p-20)^2 for p>0. Wait, but p is modules beyond 20, so p is at least 1 when production is 21. 

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the cost structure. The total waste cost is $12 for up to 20 modules. If you produce more than 20, the waste cost is 12 plus 4*(p-20)^2. Because p is the number over 20. So for any p>0, the cost is 12 + 4*(p-20)^2. 

Wait, but if p is the number beyond 20, then for 21 modules, p=1. So the cost would be 12 +4*(1)^2=16. But wait, that seems like a small increase. Let me check if I'm interpreting this correctly. 

Wait, the problem says the cost is fixed at $12 for up to 20 modules. After that, the waste cost increases according to 4*(p-20)^2, where p is modules in excess of 20. So for p=0 (20 modules), cost is $12. For p=1 (21 modules), cost is 12+4*(1)^2=16. For p=25 (45 modules), it's 12 +4*(25)^2=12+2500=2512, which matches what I calculated earlier. 

So for part (i), 45 modules, the cost is $2512. Now, looking at the options, E is $2512 and 20 modules. But part (ii) is about minimizing the waste cost. So what's the production number that minimizes the waste cost?

Wait, the cost function is 12 +4*(p-20)^2 for p>0. Wait, but p is the number of modules beyond 20. So p can be any positive number, but the cost function is a quadratic that increases as p moves away from 0. So the minimum occurs at p=0, which is 20 modules. So the minimal waste cost is $12 when producing exactly 20 modules. 

But wait, that doesn't make sense because producing more modules would require more materials, so perhaps the waste cost should be lower when producing less? Or maybe the function is structured such that the minimal cost is at p=0, which is 20 modules. So the minimal total waste cost is $12, achieved at 20 modules. 

But looking at the options, option E is $2512 and 20 modules. But wait, E's first number is 2512, which is the cost for 45 modules. So perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I misread the function. The problem says the cost is fixed at $12 for up to 20 modules. After that, the waste cost increases according to 4*(p-20)^2. So for p=0 (20 modules), it's $12. For p=1 (21), it's 4*(1)^2 =4, so total cost is 12+4=16. But wait, that's lower than $12? No, that can't be. Wait, that can't be right because 16 is more than 12. So the cost increases as p increases beyond 0. So the minimal cost is at p=0, which is 20 modules, with a cost of $12. 

But in the options, the only one that has 20 modules is E, which says $2512 and 20 modules. But that's not matching because $2512 is for 45 modules. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the function. Maybe the function is 4*(p)^2, not (p-20)^2. Let me read again. 

The problem states: "the waste cost increases according to the function $4 (p - 20)^2 where p is the modules in excess of 20 produced." So p is modules beyond 20. So for p=1, it's 4*(1-20)^2=4*(-19)^2=4*361=1444. That would make the total cost 12 +1444=1456 for 21 modules. But that seems too high, which doesn't make sense. That can't be right because producing one more module beyond 20 would result in a huge cost increase, which seems unrealistic. 

Wait, perhaps I misread the function. Maybe the function is 4*(p)^2, where p is the number beyond 20. So for p=1, it's 4*(1)^2=4, so total cost is 12+4=16. For p=25, it's 4*(25)^2=2500, so total cost is 2512. That seems more reasonable. 

Wait, but the problem says (p -20)^2, so p is the modules in excess of 20. So for 21 modules, p=1, so (1-20)= -19, squared is 361, times 4 is 1444. So total cost would be 12+1444=1456. That seems way too high for just one extra module beyond 20. That doesn't make sense in a real-world scenario, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is 4*(p)^2, where p is the number beyond 20. So for p=1, it's 4*(1)^2=4, so total cost is 16. That makes more sense. But according to the problem, it's (p-20)^2. So I'm confused. 

Wait, perhaps the formula is 4*(p)^2, where p is the number beyond 20. So for 21 modules, p=1, cost is 4*(1)^2=4, so total waste is 12+4=16. For 25 modules, p=5, cost is 4*25=100, total 112. For 45 modules, p=25, cost is 4*625=2500, total 2512. That matches option E for part (i). 

But wait, the problem says (p-20)^2. So perhaps I should stick with that. So for p=25, the cost is 4*(25-20)^2=4*(5)^2=100. So total cost is 12+100=112. But that's not matching any of the options. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the function is 4*(p -20)^2, where p is the number of modules. So if p=45, then p-20=25, so 4*(25)^2=2500, plus 12=2512. That's correct for part (i). 

But for part (ii), to minimize the waste cost, we need to find the p that minimizes 4*(p-20)^2 +12. The minimal value of (p-20)^2 is zero, which occurs when p=20. But p is modules beyond 20, so p=0. So the minimal cost is $12 when p=0, which is 20 modules. That matches option E, which says $2512 and 20 modules. Wait, no, because option E's first number is 2512, which is for 45 modules, and the second is 20 modules, which is the minimal point. 

Wait, but in the options, E is $2512 and 20 modules. That would mean that part (i) is 2512, part (ii) is 20 modules. So the answer would be E. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in part (ii). Let me think again. The cost function is 12 +4*(p-20)^2 for p>20. Wait, no, p is the number beyond 20, so p can be 1,2,3,... So the function is 12 +4*(p)^2. Because p is modules beyond 20, so p=1 corresponds to 21 modules. So the function is 12 +4*(p)^2. To minimize this, we set p=0, which is 20 modules, cost 12. 

But in the options, only E has 20 modules as the minimal point, and part (i) is 2512, which is correct. So the answer should be E. 

Wait, but looking at the options again, E is $2512 and 20 modules. So part (i) is 2512, part (ii) is 20 modules. That makes sense. So the answer is E.

To determine the total waste cost for producing 45 modules and the number of modules that minimizes waste cost, we analyze the given cost function.

### Part (i): Total Waste Cost for 45 Modules
The waste cost function is defined as:
- **Fixed cost**: $12 for up to 20 modules.
- **Variable cost**: $4(p - 20)^2 for modules produced beyond 20, where \( p \) is the number of modules in excess of 20.

For 45 modules:
- \( p = 45 - 20 = 25 \).
- Variable cost = \( 4(25 - 20)^2 = 4(5)^2 = 4 \times 25 = 100 \).
- Total waste cost = Fixed cost + Variable cost = \( 12 + 100 = 112 \).

However, this calculation contradicts the options provided, suggesting a misinterpretation of the function. Re-evaluating, the function \( 4(p - 20)^2 \) implies:
- For \( p = 25 \), variable cost = \( 4(25)^2 = 4 \times 625 = 2500 \).
- Total waste cost = \( 12 + 2500 = 2512 \).

Thus, the total waste cost for 45 modules is **$2512**.

### Part (ii): Number of Modules Minimizing Waste Cost
The waste cost function is \( 12 + 4(p - 20)^2 \). To minimize this:
- The term \( (p - 20)^2 \) is minimized when \( p = 20 \), making the variable cost zero.
- Therefore, the waste cost is minimized at **20 modules**.

### Final Answer
The total waste cost for producing 45 modules is **$2512**, and the number of modules that minimizes waste cost is **20 modules**.
