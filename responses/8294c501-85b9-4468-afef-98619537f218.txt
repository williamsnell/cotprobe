Question:

The earthworm has a central nerve cord running along the entire length of the body. When an earthworm is cut into several parts, severing its nerve cord in the process, each part will go on crawling around for some time. How can each fragment carry out crawling movement even after the nerve cord is severed?

Options:

A: The earthworm can regenerate its nerve cord quickly.
B: The earthworm has a backup nerve cord that takes over when the main one is severed.
C: The earthworm uses chemical signals to communicate and coordinate movement between segments.
D: The earthworm's body movements are controlled by a fluid-filled hydraulic system independent of the nerve cord.
E: The earthworm has a centralized brain controlling all movements.
F: The earthworm's movements are not controlled by its nervous system.
G: The earthworm has more than one neural center controlling and coordinating its activities.
H: The earthwormâ€™s skin is sensitive to touch, allowing for movement without a nerve cord.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this earthworm question. The question says that when an earthworm is cut into several parts, severing its nerve cord, each part can still crawl around for some time. I need to figure out why that's possible.

First, I remember that earthworms have a central nerve cord, which runs along their body. But when it's cut, each segment can still move. That suggests that the nerve cord isn't the only way they control movement. Maybe each segment has some local control?

Looking at the options:

A says the worm can regenerate the nerve cord quickly. I don't think that's the case because the question says each part moves after being severed, implying they don't wait for regeneration.

B suggests a backup nerve cord. I'm not sure earthworms have that. They have a main cord, but maybe each segment has its own ganglia.

C talks about chemical signals. While earthworms do use them for communication, like in reproduction, I'm not sure if that's the main reason for movement after the cord is cut.

D mentions a hydraulic system. I know earthworms move using muscles and skin, not hydraulics. They have circular and longitudinal muscles that contract to move, so this might not be it.

E says a centralized brain controls everything. But if the nerve cord is cut, the brain can't send signals, so each part should be independent. So E doesn't explain the movement.

F claims movements aren't controlled by the nervous system. That can't be right because without the nervous system, how would they move? They must have some neural control.

G suggests multiple neural centers. This makes sense. If each segment has its own ganglia (like small brains), they can control local movement even without the central cord. So each part can still move because they have their own control centers.

H says the skin is sensitive enough to allow movement without the cord. While the skin is sensitive, I think the movement is more about the muscles and the nervous system coordinating them, so maybe not H.

So, the best option seems to be G. Each segment has its own neural centers, so even if the main cord is cut, they can still move using their own ganglia to control muscles.

The earthworm's ability to crawl even after the nerve cord is severed suggests that its movement isn't solely dependent on the central nervous system. Instead, each segment of the earthworm likely has its own neural centers or ganglia that can independently control local movements. This decentralized system allows each fragment to continue crawling without relying on the severed main nerve cord.

Answer: G
