Question:

 Which of the following is not an objection Pence gives to the argument that SCNT is not best for the child?

Options:

A: The potential for genetic abnormalities is not a valid argument against SCNT.
B: The expectations people will place on SCNT individuals could be no worse than normal expectations of children created sexually.

E: The argument fails to take into account the rights and autonomy of the parents.
F: The argument neglects the emotional and psychological well-being of the child.
G: People's prejudicial attitudes are likely to change.
H: SCNT could potentially lead to advancements in medical research and treatment.

Alright, so I've got this question about Pence's objections to the argument that SCNT (somatic cell nuclear transfer) isn't the best for a child. I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It's asking which of the options is NOT an objection that Pence gives. So, I need to figure out which of these options isn't something Pence argues against the given statement.

I remember that SCNT is a cloning technique where the nucleus from a somatic cell is transferred into an enucleated egg, creating an embryo. The argument here is that SCNT isn't the best for a child, and Pence is providing objections to that argument. So, each option is an objection, but one of them isn't something Pence actually argues.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: The potential for genetic abnormalities is not a valid argument against SCNT. So, if someone argues against SCNT because they think it leads to more genetic issues, Pence is saying that's not a valid point. That makes sense because I think Pence might argue that the risks are manageable or not as significant as others claim.

Option B: The expectations people will place on SCNT individuals could be no worse than normal expectations. So, if people think cloned children will have higher expectations, Pence is saying that's not worse than what's typical. Maybe he's downplaying the social impact of expectations.

Option C: The argument falsely assumes that SCNT individuals would have a lesser quality of life. So, if the argument against SCNT says cloned people will have a worse life, Pence is saying that's a wrong assumption. He might argue that their quality of life isn't inherently worse.

Option D: The argument assumes genetic determinism or genetic reductionism. Genetic determinism is the belief that genes determine everything, so if the argument against SCNT relies on that, Pence is saying that's a flawed assumption. He might be arguing that genes don't completely determine a person's life, so that's not a good reason to oppose SCNT.

Option E: The argument fails to take into account the rights and autonomy of the parents. If someone argues against SCNT without considering parents' rights, Pence is pointing that out. Wait, but does he really argue that? I'm not sure. Maybe he's more focused on other aspects.

Option F: The argument neglects the emotional and psychological well-being of the child. If the argument against SCNT doesn't consider the child's mental health, Pence is saying that's a mistake. But I'm not sure if this is one of his points.

Option G: People's prejudicial attitudes are likely to change. So, if the argument against SCNT includes concerns about societal prejudice, Pence is saying those attitudes will improve. That sounds like he's dismissing prejudice as a reason, thinking it's temporary.

Option H: SCNT could potentially lead to advancements in medical research and treatment. This seems more like a pro-SCNT argument. If someone is against SCNT, they might counter by pointing out the benefits. Wait, but the question is about objections to the argument that SCNT isn't best for the child. So, if the argument is that SCNT is bad for the child, H is a counterpoint about its benefits, which makes sense as an objection. So, H is an objection Pence would make.

Option I: The argument ignores the potential benefits of SCNT to society. Similar to H, this is about broader societal benefits, which could be an objection to the argument against SCNT.

Option J: If people's prejudicial attitudes do not change, then we should not allow SCNT. So, if prejudice doesn't change, J is saying SCNT should be banned. But wait, this seems like a conditional statement. I'm not sure if this is an objection that Pence gives. It might actually be the opposite; if prejudice doesn't change, maybe Pence would argue against SCNT. Or perhaps he's saying that prejudice is a valid concern only if it doesn't change. I'm a bit confused here.

Now, the question is which is NOT an objection. So, the correct answer is the one that's not something Pence argues against.

From what I recall, Pence's main objections include pointing out that genetic abnormalities aren't a strong argument, that the quality of life isn't necessarily worse, that genetic determinism is assumed, and that societal benefits exist. He might also argue that societal attitudes can change (G), so prejudice isn't a permanent issue.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see. The question is about objections to the argument that SCNT isn't best for the child. So, the argument is that SCNT is bad for the child, and Pence is objecting to that argument.

So, each option is an objection Pence makes. The incorrect one is the one that's not an objection.

Option E: Fails to take into account parents' rights. I think this might not be an objection. Because if the argument against SCNT doesn't consider parents' rights, that's a flaw. But I'm not sure if Pence specifically addresses parents' rights as an objection. He might focus more on the child's well-being, genetic issues, and societal attitudes.

Alternatively, perhaps E is not an objection. Wait, the question is which is NOT an objection. So, which option is not something Pence uses to object.

I think E is not an objection because it's more about the rights of the parents, and Pence's arguments are more centered around the child's quality of life, genetic issues, and societal factors, not so much about parental rights. Or maybe he does address it. I'm a bit unsure.

Alternatively, perhaps F is not an objection. But I think F is about emotional well-being, which is something Pence does address.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of which options are definitely objections.

A: Yes, he argues genetic abnormalities aren't a good reason.

B: He might argue that expectations aren't worse.

C: Argues quality of life isn't lesser.

D: Argues against genetic determinism.

G: Argues that attitudes will change, so prejudice isn't a big issue.

H: Argues about medical benefits.

I: Argues about societal benefits.

J: Conditional on prejudice, so perhaps this isn't an objection but a counter.

E and F: Not sure.

Wait, the answer options go from A to J, and the correct answer is one of them.

I think the answer is E: The argument fails to take into account the rights and autonomy of the parents.

Because in Pence's arguments, he focuses on the child's well-being, genetic aspects, and societal factors, but not necessarily the parents' rights. So E is not an objection he makes, making it the correct answer.

The question asks which option is not an objection that Pence gives to the argument that SCNT is not best for the child. After analyzing each option, it becomes clear that while Pence addresses concerns related to genetic abnormalities, societal attitudes, medical advancements, and the quality of life for SCNT individuals, he does not specifically argue that the rights and autonomy of parents are being overlooked. Therefore, the correct answer is:

E
