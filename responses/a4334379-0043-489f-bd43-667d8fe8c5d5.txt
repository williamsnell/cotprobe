Okay, so I have this economics question about average total cost, and I need to figure out which option is correct. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that average total cost (ATC) is a concept in microeconomics that refers to the per-unit cost of producing a certain quantity of goods or services. It's calculated by dividing the total costs by the number of units produced.

Looking at the options:

Option A says ATC is total fixed costs plus total variable costs. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Because total fixed costs (TFC) and total variable costs (TVC) added together give total costs (TC), not ATC. So A is probably wrong because it's describing TC, not ATC.

Option B claims ATC is total costs divided by marginal cost. No, that's not correct. Marginal cost is the cost of producing one more unit, and ATC is total costs divided by quantity, not divided by marginal cost. So B is incorrect.

Option C states ATC is TVC divided by quantity. Hmm, that's actually the definition of average variable cost (AVC), not ATC. So C is wrong.

Option D says ATC is TFC divided by quantity. That's average fixed cost (AFC), not ATC. So D is also incorrect.

Option E: ATC equals AVC plus marginal cost. Wait, I think the correct formula is ATC equals AVC plus average fixed cost (AFC). Because total cost is TVC + TFC, so ATC = (TVC + TFC)/Q = TVC/Q + TFC/Q = AVC + AFC. So E is incorrect because it adds AVC and MC, which doesn't make sense.

Option F: ATC is total revenue divided by quantity. No, that's average revenue, not ATC. So F is wrong.

Option G: ATC is MC divided by quantity. That doesn't fit because ATC is TC/Q, and MC is the change in TC for an extra unit. So G is incorrect.

Option H: ATC equals AVC plus AFC. Yes, this aligns with what I was thinking earlier. Because ATC is the sum of average variable and average fixed costs. So H is correct.

Option I: ATC is AFC minus AVC. That doesn't make sense because both AFC and AVC are positive components of ATC. Subtracting them would give the wrong value. So I is wrong.

Option J: ATC is AVC divided by quantity. Wait, AVC is already TVC/Q, so dividing by quantity again would be TVC/QÂ², which isn't ATC. So J is incorrect.

So after going through each option, the correct one is H: Average total cost equals average variable cost plus average fixed cost.

The correct answer is H: Average total cost equals average variable cost plus average fixed cost.
