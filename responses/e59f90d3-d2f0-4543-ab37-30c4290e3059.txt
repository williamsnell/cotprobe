Question:

A six-sided die (whose faces are numbered 1 through 6, as usual) is known to be counterfeit: The probability of rolling any even number is twice the probability of rolling any odd number. What is the probability that if this die is thrown twice, the first roll will be a 5 and the second roll will be a 6?

Options:

A: 1/27
B: 2/81
C: 1/9
D: 1/18
E: 2/9
F: 3/81
G: 2/27
H: 1/81
I: 3/27
J: 2/18

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this probability problem. Let me see... The question is about a six-sided die that's counterfeit. The thing is, the probability of rolling any even number is twice the probability of rolling any odd number. And I need to find the probability that when I throw this die twice, the first roll is a 5 and the second is a 6.

Alright, let's break this down step by step. First, I need to understand how the probabilities are set up for each face of the die. Normally, a fair die has each number from 1 to 6 with equal probability, which is 1/6 each. But this die is counterfeit, so the probabilities aren't the same for even and odd numbers.

The problem says the probability of rolling an even number is twice that of rolling an odd number. Let me denote the probability of rolling an odd number as p. Then, the probability of rolling an even number would be 2p. 

Wait, but how many odd and even numbers are there on a die? There are three odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, and three even numbers: 2, 4, 6. So, each odd number has probability p, and each even number has probability 2p. But since the die must sum up to a total probability of 1, I can set up an equation.

So, the total probability is 3*p (for the three odd numbers) plus 3*(2p) (for the three even numbers) equals 1. Let me write that out:

3p + 3*(2p) = 1

Simplify that:

3p + 6p = 1
9p = 1
p = 1/9

So, each odd number has a probability of 1/9, and each even number has a probability of 2/9. That makes sense because 3*(1/9) = 1/3 for odds and 3*(2/9) = 6/9 = 2/3 for evens, and 1/3 + 2/3 = 1.

Now, the problem asks for the probability that the first roll is a 5 and the second is a 6. Since each roll is independent, I can multiply the probabilities of each individual event happening.

First, the probability of rolling a 5. Since 5 is odd, its probability is 1/9. Then, the probability of rolling a 6, which is even, is 2/9.

So, the combined probability is (1/9) * (2/9) = 2/81.

Wait, let me double-check that. 1/9 for 5 and 2/9 for 6. Multiplying them together: numerator 1*2=2, denominator 9*9=81. Yep, 2/81.

Looking at the options, that's option B: 2/81. But let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations.

Wait, another thought: Are the even numbers each twice as likely as the odds? So each even number is 2p. So, for 6, which is even, the probability is 2p. Since p = 1/9, 2p is 2/9. Correct.

And for 5, it's 1/9. So, yes, the multiplication is right. So the answer should be 2/81, which is option B.
</think>

The probability of rolling a 5 (odd) is 1/9, and rolling a 6 (even) is 2/9. Multiply these probabilities for independent events: (1/9) * (2/9) = 2/81.

Answer: B

The answer is B.

B: 2/81
