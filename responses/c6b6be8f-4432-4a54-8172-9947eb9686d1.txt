Okay, let's see. I have this problem where I need to find the inverse of the function h(x), which is defined as f(g(x)). The functions f and g are given as f(x) = 3x + 4 and g(x) = 2x - 3. 

First, I think I should figure out what h(x) is. Since h(x) is f(g(x)), I need to substitute g(x) into f(x). So, wherever there's an x in f(x), I'll replace it with g(x). 

Let me write that out: h(x) = f(g(x)) = 3*(g(x)) + 4. And since g(x) is 2x - 3, substituting that in gives h(x) = 3*(2x - 3) + 4. 

Now I'll simplify that. Multiply 3 by both terms inside the parentheses: 3*2x is 6x, and 3*(-3) is -9. So h(x) becomes 6x - 9 + 4. Then, combining the constants, -9 + 4 is -5. So h(x) = 6x - 5.

Wait, did I do that right? Let me check. 3*(2x -3) is indeed 6x -9. Adding 4 gives 6x -5. Yep, that seems correct.

Now I need to find the inverse of h(x). The inverse function, let's call it h⁻¹(x), is the function that undoes what h(x) does. So, to find h⁻¹(x), I'll switch x and y in the equation y = h(x), then solve for y.

Starting with y = 6x -5. To find the inverse, swap x and y: x = 6y -5. Now, I need to solve for y.

Let me do that step by step. So, starting with x = 6y -5. I can add 5 to both sides to get rid of the -5 on the right. That gives x + 5 = 6y. 

Then, to isolate y, I'll divide both sides by 6. So y = (x + 5)/6. 

Wait, that would make h⁻¹(x) equal to (x +5)/6. Let me check if that's one of the options. Looking at the options, option H is (x +5)/6. So that's probably the answer.

But let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through the steps again. 

h(x) = f(g(x)) = 3*(2x -3) +4. 

3*(2x) is 6x, 3*(-3) is -9, so 6x -9 +4 is 6x -5. Correct.

To find the inverse, set y =6x -5. Swap x and y: x=6y -5. Add 5: x+5 =6y. Divide by 6: y=(x+5)/6. Yep, that's right.

Wait, maybe I should test it to be sure. Let's pick a value, say x=1. h(1)=6*1 -5=1. So h(1)=1. Then, h⁻¹(1) should be 1. Let's plug x=1 into the inverse function: (1 +5)/6=6/6=1. Correct.

Another test: x=2. h(2)=6*2 -5=12-5=7. So h(2)=7. Then h⁻¹(7)= (7+5)/6=12/6=2. Correct again.

Hmm, seems solid. So the inverse function is (x +5)/6, which is option H.

The inverse of \( h(x) \) is found by substituting \( g(x) \) into \( f(x) \), simplifying to \( h(x) = 6x - 5 \), then solving for the inverse function, resulting in \( \frac{x + 5}{6} \). 

Answer: H
