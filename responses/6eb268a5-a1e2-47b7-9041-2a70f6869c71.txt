Okay, so I've got this integral to evaluate, and I need to pick the right answer from options A to J. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

The integral is from 0 to 0.4 of [Γ(7)/(Γ(4)Γ(3))] * y^3 * (1-y)^2 dy. Hmm, Γ functions here. I remember that Γ(n) is (n-1)! for positive integers. So let's compute Γ(7), Γ(4), and Γ(3) first.

Γ(7) = 6! because Γ(n) = (n-1)! So 6! is 720. Γ(4) is 3! which is 6, and Γ(3) is 2! which is 2. So the coefficient is Γ(7)/(Γ(4)Γ(3)) = 720/(6*2) = 720/12 = 60. So the integral simplifies to 60 * ∫ from 0 to 0.4 of y^3 (1 - y)^2 dy.

Now I need to compute that integral. Let's expand y^3(1 - y)^2. Expanding (1 - y)^2 gives 1 - 2y + y^2. So when multiplied by y^3, the integrand becomes y^3 - 2y^4 + y^5. So the integral becomes 60 times the integral of y^3 - 2y^4 + y^5 dy from 0 to 0.4.

I'll integrate term by term. The integral of y^n dy is y^(n+1)/(n+1). So:

Integral of y^3 is y^4 /4,
Integral of -2y^4 is -2*(y^5/5),
Integral of y^5 is y^6 /6.

Putting it all together, the integral becomes:

60 * [ (y^4/4) - (2y^5)/5 + (y^6)/6 ] evaluated from 0 to 0.4.

Now plug in y = 0.4:

First term: (0.4)^4 /4. Let's compute 0.4^4. 0.4^2 is 0.16, so 0.16^2 is 0.0256. Divide by 4: 0.0064.

Second term: -2*(0.4)^5 /5. 0.4^5 is 0.4 * 0.4^4 = 0.4 * 0.0256 = 0.01024. Multiply by -2: -0.02048. Divide by 5: -0.004096.

Third term: (0.4)^6 /6. 0.4^6 is (0.4^3)^2. 0.4^3 is 0.064, so squared is 0.004096. Divide by 6: approximately 0.00068266667.

Adding these three terms together:

0.0064 - 0.004096 = 0.002304, plus 0.00068266667 gives approximately 0.00298666667.

Now multiply this by 60:

60 * 0.00298666667 ≈ 0.1792.

Looking at the options, F is 0.1792. So I think the answer is F.

The integral simplifies to 60 times the integral of y^3(1-y)^2 dy from 0 to 0.4. Expanding and integrating term by term gives the result 0.1792.

Answer: F
