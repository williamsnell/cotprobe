Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. So, the question says that x and y are inversely proportional. Hmm, I remember that when two variables are inversely proportional, their product is a constant. So, that means x * y = k, where k is a constant. Got that part.

Now, the problem states that when the sum of x and y is 42, x is twice y. So, let's write that down. So, x + y = 42, and x = 2y. Oh, right, so we can substitute x in the first equation with 2y. Let me do that.

Substituting x = 2y into x + y = 42 gives 2y + y = 42. That simplifies to 3y = 42. So, y must be 42 divided by 3, which is 14. Wait, so y is 14 when x is twice y. Then, x would be 28 because x is twice y (2*14=28). 

Now, since x and y are inversely proportional, their product should be the same constant k. So, k = x * y = 28 * 14. Let me calculate that. 28 times 14... 28*10 is 280, 28*4 is 112, so total is 280+112=392. So, k is 392.

The question asks for the value of y when x is -8. So, using the inverse proportionality, x * y = k. Plugging in x = -8, we get (-8) * y = 392. To find y, we divide both sides by -8. So, y = 392 / (-8). Let me compute that.

392 divided by 8 is 49, so 392 / (-8) would be -49. Wait, but looking at the options, -49 is option F. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait a second, when I calculated 28 * 14, I think I made a mistake there. Let me recalculate that. 28 times 14: 20*14=280, 8*14=112, adding them gives 392. Oh, that's correct. So k is indeed 392. Then, when x is -8, y is 392 / (-8) = -49. 

Looking back at the options, option F is -49. So, the answer should be F. But wait, let me check if there's another way to approach this to confirm. Alternatively, since x and y are inversely proportional, y is equal to k/x. So when x is -8, y = 392 / (-8) = -49. Yep, same result. I think that's correct.

The numbers \( x \) and \( y \) are inversely proportional, meaning \( x \times y = k \), a constant. When \( x + y = 42 \) and \( x = 2y \), substituting gives \( 2y + y = 42 \), so \( y = 14 \) and \( x = 28 \). Thus, \( k = 28 \times 14 = 392 \). When \( x = -8 \), \( y = \frac{392}{-8} = -49 \).

Answer: F
