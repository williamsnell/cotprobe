Okay, so I've got this problem about depreciation, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. Tom bought a bike for $80 and sold it after 4 years for $15. They want to know the annual depreciation using the straight line method, and also the annual rate of depreciation. The options are A to J, each with different numbers. Hmm.

Wait, straight line depreciation. Oh right, that's where the value decreases by the same amount each year. So, the formula for straight line is (Cost - Salvage Value)/Useful Life. So here, cost is $80, salvage is $15, and life is 4 years. So the total depreciation is 80-15 = 65. Divided by 4 years gives 16.25 per year. So that's the annual depreciation rate. So looking at the options, I see option B is $16.25 per year and 20.3%. Option D is $19 and 23.75. Wait, no, the annual rate—oh, I think the question is asking for both annual depreciation amount and the rate.

Wait, but wait, the straight line method calculates the annual rate as the total depreciation divided by the number of years, right? So 65 divided by 4 is 16.25. So the annual rate is 16.25%. Looking at the options, that would be option B. But wait, let me double-check. Or is the annual rate the percentage, not the dollar amount?

Wait, the question says "annual depreciation by the straight line method". Oh, so that's the dollar amount. So the straight line rate is 16.25 per year. So the annual rate is also 16.25%. So looking for 16.25 per year, which would be option B, which states 16.25 per year and 20.3%? Wait, no. Option B says 16.25 per year, but the rate is 20.3%. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, no. The straight line method's annual rate is the depreciation rate, which is the total depreciation divided by the number of years. So 65 /4 is 16.25, so the rate is 16.25 per year. So the annual rate is 16.25, but the rate as a percentage of the original cost? Or the percentage of what? The rate is 16.25, not a percentage. Wait, no, the rate is the percentage of the value that depreciates each year. So maybe I've been confusing rate and amount.

Wait, let me think again. The straight line method calculates the annual depreciation as (Cost - Salvage)/Years. So 65/4 = 16.25 per year. So the annual rate would be 16.25, but that's in dollars. So looking for an option where the first number is 16.25. Looking at the options, option B says $16.25 per year and 20.3%. Oh wait, but that's the number of annual depreciation, not the rate as a percentage. So maybe I'm getting something wrong.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the annual rate of depreciation, not the amount. The straight line method's annual rate is the percentage that the value decreases each year. So the formula for the annual rate is (Depreciation / Original Cost) * 100. So 16.25 / 80 *100 = (16.25 *100)/80 = 16.25 *0.0125 = 0.203125, which is 20.3125%. So the annual rate is approximately 20.3%, which matches option B's rate, but the amount is 16.25 per year.

Wait, but the options list the first number as the amount, and the second as the rate. So I think the question is asking for the annual depreciation amount (so $16.25) and the annual rate percentage (20.3%). So the correct option would have 16.25 and 20.3%. Looking at the options:

Option B: 16.25 per year and 20.3%. So if the question is asking for both, B would be correct. But wait, the options in the problem list them as separate. Let me read the question again. Oh, the question says "What was the annual depreciation by the straight line method? What was the annual rate of depreciation?"

Wait, I think perhaps the question is asking for two things: the annual depreciation amount, and the annual rate of depreciation. So the amount is $16.25, the rate is 20.3%. So the correct option would be B: $16.25 and 20.3%.

But wait, the options are A to J, each with two numbers. Let me see the options again:

Option A: 13 and 16.25% → amount $13, rate 16.25%
Option B: 16.25 and 20.3
Option C: 17 and 21.25
Option D: 19 and 23.75
Option E: 14.75 and 18.4
Option F: 15.25 and 19%
Option G: 18 and 22.5
Option H: 16 and 20%
Option I: 12.5 and 15.6
Option J: 20 and 25%

So if the amount is $16.25 and the rate is 20.3%, then option B is correct. But wait, I need to make sure whether the question is asking for the amount of depreciation each year, which is $16.25, and the annual rate of depreciation as a percentage. So yes, option B is the correct one.

The problem involves calculating the annual depreciation using the straight line method and determining the annual rate of depreciation. Tom bought a bicycle for $80 and sold it for $15 after 4 years. The total depreciation is $80 - $15 = $65 over 4 years. The annual depreciation amount is $65 / 4 = $16.25. The annual rate of depreciation is calculated as (Depreciation / Cost) * 100 = (16.25 / 80) * 100 = 20.3125%, which rounds to 20.3%.

Looking at the options, the correct answer is the one that lists $16.25 as the annual depreciation amount and 20.3% as the annual rate. This corresponds to **Option B**.
