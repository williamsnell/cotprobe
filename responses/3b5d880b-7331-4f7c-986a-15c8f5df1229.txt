Okay, so I'm trying to solve this statistics problem about determining the required sample size for a confidence interval. Let me go through it step by step.

The problem says a quality engineer wants to be 98% confident that the maximum error in estimating the mean strength μ is 0.25. They provided a preliminary sample of 32 parts, which gave a sample mean of 35.68 and a standard deviation of 1.723. The question is asking how large a sample is required, and the options are given from A to J.

First, I remember that the formula for the required sample size when estimating the mean with a specified confidence level and margin of error (E) is:

n = (Z * σ / E)^2

But wait, in this case, since we're given a sample standard deviation (s) from a preliminary sample, we might need to use the t-distribution instead of the Z-score, right? Because when the population standard deviation σ is unknown, we use the t-critical value and the sample standard deviation s. However, for sample size determination, sometimes the Z-score is used even when σ is unknown because the t-distribution depends on the sample size, which is what we're trying to find. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, no. Actually, for calculating the sample size required, the formula typically uses the Z-score because the t-distribution isn't known until you have the sample size. So, maybe I should proceed with the Z-score method here.

Okay, so let's break it down. The confidence level is 98%, which means α = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02. Since it's a two-tailed test (because we're dealing with a confidence interval), we'll divide α by 2. So, α/2 = 0.01.

Now, I need to find the Z-score corresponding to a cumulative probability of 0.99 (since 0.98 confidence means 99% in each tail). Let me recall some Z-table values. The Z-score for 0.99 is approximately 2.33. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The Z-score for 99% cumulative probability is about 2.33, but wait, 99% corresponds to 2.33, and 99.5% is about 2.575. Wait, but wait, confidence level is 98%, so the tails are each 1%. So, the Z-score for 0.99 (since 1 - 0.01 = 0.99) is actually approximately 2.33. Or wait, is it 2.534? Hmm, maybe I should get the exact value.

Alternatively, I can use the standard Z-values. For 98% confidence, the Z-score is Z_{α/2} = Z_{0.01} ≈ 2.33. Let me confirm: yes, the Z-score for 0.01 in the upper tail is about 2.33. So Z = 2.33.

Next, the margin of error E is given as 0.25.

The sample standard deviation s is 1.723, and since we're using s as an estimate for σ, we plug that into the formula.

So, putting it all together:

n = (Z * s / E)^2

Plugging the numbers in:

n = (2.33 * 1.723 / 0.25)^2

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute the numerator: 2.33 * 1.723.

2.33 * 1.723 ≈ Let me calculate that.

2.33 * 1.7 = 3.941
2.33 * 0.023 = approximately 0.05359
Adding them together: 3.941 + 0.05359 ≈ 3.99459

So, approximately 3.9946.

Then, divide that by E, which is 0.25:

3.9946 / 0.25 = 15.9784

Now, square that: (15.9784)^2 ≈ ?

Well, 16^2 = 256, so 15.9784 is just a bit less than 16, so the square will be just under 256. Let me compute it more accurately.

15.9784 * 15.9784:

Let's do 16 * 16 = 256.

But since it's 15.9784, that's 16 - 0.0216.

So, (16 - 0.0216)^2 = 16^2 - 2*16*0.0216 + (0.0216)^2

= 256 - 0.6912 + 0.00046656 ≈ 256 - 0.6912 = 255.3088 + 0.00046656 ≈ 255.3093.

So approximately 255.3093.

Since sample size must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number, which is 256.

Wait, but looking at the options, 256 isn't one of them. The options are A:275, B:210, C:190, D:170, E:245, F:257, G:320, H:225, I:300, J:150.

Hmm, the closest option is F:257. Wait, but I got approximately 255.3, which would round up to 256, but 257 is option F. Alternatively, maybe I made an error in calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the Z-score. Maybe the Z-score for 98% confidence is higher. Let me think again.

Wait, 98% confidence corresponds to α=0.02, so α/2=0.01. The Z-score for 0.01 in the upper tail is approximately 2.33. Let me check a Z-table.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a more precise value. Let me think: the exact Z-score for 0.99 cumulative probability is about 2.326. So maybe I should use 2.326 instead of 2.33.

So let me recalculate with Z = 2.326.

Compute 2.326 * 1.723.

2.326 * 1.723: Let me compute this accurately.

2 * 1.723 = 3.446
0.326 * 1.723: Let's compute that.

0.3 * 1.723 = 0.5169
0.026 * 1.723 ≈ 0.044798
Adding together: 0.5169 + 0.044798 ≈ 0.561698

So total is 3.446 + 0.561698 ≈ 4.007698.

Then, 4.007698 / 0.25 = 16.030792.

Now, square that: (16.030792)^2.

16^2 = 256.

0.030792^2 ≈ 0.000948.

2 * 16 * 0.030792 ≈ 0.985.

So, (16 + 0.030792)^2 = 16^2 + 2*16*0.030792 + (0.030792)^2 ≈ 256 + 0.985 + 0.000948 ≈ 256.985948.

So approximately 256.986, which rounds up to 257.

Ah, so that's why option F is 257. So the required sample size is 257.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it directly.

Let me compute 2.326 * 1.723.

2.326 * 1.723:

I can compute this as:

2 * 1.723 = 3.446

0.3 * 1.723 = 0.5169

0.02 * 1.723 = 0.03446

0.006 * 1.723 = 0.010338

Adding all together: 3.446 + 0.5169 = 3.9629

3.9629 + 0.03446 = 3.99736

3.99736 + 0.010338 ≈ 4.007698

So, yes, that's correct.

Then, 4.007698 / 0.25 = 16.030792.

Now, (16.030792)^2:

Let me compute 16.030792 * 16.030792.

Let me write it as (16 + 0.030792)^2.

Which is 16^2 + 2*16*0.030792 + (0.030792)^2.

16^2 = 256.

2*16*0.030792=32 * 0.030792 ≈ 0.985344.

(0.030792)^2 ≈ 0.000948.

Adding them up: 256 + 0.985344 + 0.000948 ≈ 256.986292.

So approximately 256.986, which rounds up to 257.

Therefore, the required sample size is 257, which is option F.
</think>

To determine the required sample size for a 98% confidence interval with a maximum error of 0.25, we use the formula:

n = (Z * s / E)^2

Where:
- Z = 2.326 (Z-score for 98% confidence)
- s = 1.723 (sample standard deviation)
- E = 0.25 (margin of error)

Calculations:
1. Compute Z * s: 2.326 * 1.723 ≈ 4.0077
2. Divide by E: 4.0077 / 0.25 ≈ 16.0308
3. Square the result: (16.0308)^2 ≈ 256.986
4. Round up to the nearest whole number: 257

Thus, the required sample size is 257, corresponding to option F.
