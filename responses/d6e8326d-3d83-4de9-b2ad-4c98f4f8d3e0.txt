Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this question about Tunisia. The question is asking what percentage of Tunisians, as of 2018, believe that having an increasing number of people from different races, ethnic groups, and nationalities makes their country a better place to live. The options are A through J, with various percentages.

First, I remember that Tunisia is a country in North Africa, and I think it's relatively more diverse compared to some of its neighbors, but I'm not entirely sure. I'm trying to recall if there have been any recent studies or surveys about this topic. Maybe the World Values Survey or some other international polling organization has data on this.

I think the question is about multiculturalism and how people perceive it. So I'm looking for a survey that measures attitudes towards diversity. I'm not exactly sure of the exact number, but I remember hearing that in some Arab countries, the support for multiculturalism isn't as high as in Western countries. But Tunisia is a bit different because of its history and proximity to Europe, so maybe the numbers are higher there.

Looking at the options, the higher percentages are A:70%, B:64%, H:85%, J:69%. The lower ones are D:24%, E:39%, F:54%, G:45%, and I:10%. I think it's more likely that a significant majority would have a positive view, but I'm not certain if it's over 50% or maybe around 60%.

Wait, I think I read somewhere that in Tunisia, around 60% or so of people have a positive view towards diversity. Let me think. Maybe the exact figure is 64%? That's option B. Alternatively, 59% is option C, which is close but a bit lower. Another option is F:54%, which is also a possibility but a bit lower than what I was thinking.

Alternatively, perhaps the number is even higher, like 70%, which is option A. But I'm not sure. I think I might have heard that in some Arab countries, including Tunisia, around two-thirds of the population support multiculturalism. So 64% seems plausible. Or maybe it's 59%, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: I remember a study where the percentage was over 50 but under 70. So options B, C, F, G are in that range. Between 54% and 64%, perhaps. Alternatively, I think the exact figure I saw was 64%, so that's option B.

The answer is B: 64%.
