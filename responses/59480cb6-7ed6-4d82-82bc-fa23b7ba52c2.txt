Okay, so I have this question here about which decimal number has an exact representation in binary. Hmm, I remember that binary fractions work a bit differently than decimal ones. Let me think.

First, I know that in binary, fractions are represented using powers of 2. So, for example, 0.5 in decimal is exactly 1/2, which is 0.1 in binary. That makes sense. So option H is 0.5, which I think is exactly representable.

Wait, what about the others? Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: 0.8. That's 4/5. I'm not sure if 5 is a power of 2. Since 5 isn't, maybe 0.8 can't be exactly represented. Let me check. 0.8 as a fraction is 4/5, and 5 is 2Â² + 1, which isn't a power of 2. So in binary, it would probably repeat, right?

Option B: 0.3. That's 3/10. 10 is 2*5, so again, because of the 5, it's not a power of 2. So decimal 0.3 in binary would be repeating, I think.

Option C: 0.9. That's 9/10. Same as above, because 10 isn't a power of 2. So this might not have an exact binary representation.

Option D: 0.2. That's 1/5. Again, 5 isn't a power of 2, so binary would repeat.

Option E: 0.1. That's 1/10. 10 isn't a power of 2, so binary would have repeating digits, like how 1/3 is 0.333... in decimal.

Option F: 0.7. That's 7/10. Same issue as before; 10 isn't a power of 2, so no exact binary.

Option G: 0.6. That's 3/5. 5 isn't a power of 2, so again, binary would repeat.

Option H: 0.5. As I thought earlier, 0.5 is exactly 1/2, which is a power of 2. So in binary, it's 0.1, which is exact.

Option I: 0.4. That's 2/5. 5 isn't a power of 2, so binary would repeat.

So the only one that exactly represents in binary is H: 0.5. I think that's the answer.

The only decimal number with an exact binary representation is H: 0.5, as it is 1/2, which is a power of 2, resulting in a finite binary fraction (0.1).

Answer: H
