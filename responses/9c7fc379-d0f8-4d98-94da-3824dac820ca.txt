Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the mutation rate for the allele that causes chondrodystrophy in Denmark. They give the relative fitness of the allele as 0.1963. Wait, relative fitness... I think relative fitness usually refers to the survival or reproductive success of a genotype compared to others in the population. But wait, in this case, the allele is probably recessive because it's causing a disease, so maybe the fitness applies to the homozygous recessive genotype.

They also mention that there were 10 dwarfs (affected individuals) out of 94,075 births. So the observed frequency of the affected phenotype is 10/94,075. Let me calculate that first. Let me get my calculator out.

10 divided by 94,075 equals approximately 0.0001063. So the frequency q is about 0.0001063.

Wait, but in the Hardy-Weinberg model, the frequency of the homozygous recessive (q²) is equal to the observed frequency of the disease. So q squared equals 0.0001063. To find q, I take the square root of that. Let me compute that.

The square root of 0.0001063 is approximately 0.0103. So q is about 0.0103, which is the frequency of the recessive allele.

But wait, relative fitness is given as 0.1963. I'm a bit confused about how this fits in. Relative fitness usually applies to the genotype's ability to survive and reproduce. If the allele is recessive, then the fitness might be for the homozygous recessive genotype. So maybe the relative fitness (w) is the fitness of the q allele, but I'm not sure if it's the genotype or the allele itself. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. The relative fitness given is for the allele. Or maybe it's for the genotype. Let me think again. If the allele is recessive, the affected phenotype is only when the individual is homozygous recessive (qq). So the relative fitness w would be the fitness of the qq genotype compared to the others. So w for qq is 0.1963. But wait, relative fitness is usually calculated for each genotype relative to the fittest. So if the fittest genotype has a fitness of 1, then the other genotypes have lower fitnesses. But in this case, maybe the fitness of the affected genotype is 0.1963.

Wait, but how does this relate to mutation rates? Oh, because mutation rates can influence allele frequencies, especially when considering selection against a deleterious allele.

Wait, I think I need to use the mutation-selection balance formula. The mutation rate (u) is supposed to be balanced by selection against the allele. The formula for mutation-selection balance when selection is against heterozygotes or homozygotes depends on the scenario. Since this is a recessive allele, selection is probably stronger against the homozygotes.

The formula I recall is q ≈ sqrt(u / s), where s is the selection coefficient. But wait, relative fitness is w = 1 - s for the homozygous recessive, assuming that the dominant genotype has a fitness of 1. Alternatively, maybe the relative fitness is the fitness of the recessive homozygote. So if the relative fitness is 0.1963, then s = 1 - 0.1963 = 0.8037.

Wait, no. Wait, the relative fitness (w) of the homozygous recessive is 0.1963, meaning their survival or reproductive success is 19.63% of the fittest genotype (which would be perhaps the dominant homozygote, with w=1). So the selection coefficient s is 1 - w = 1 - 0.1963 = 0.8037. So s is 0.8037.

Now, under mutation-selection balance, for a recessive allele, the frequency of the allele (q) is approximately sqrt(u / s). Because q² is the frequency of the homozygous recessive, and under selection, q² = w * s, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, I think the mutation rate u is approximately equal to q² multiplied by the selection coefficient s. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, let me think again. The mutation-selection balance equation when selection is against the recessive homozygote is given by q ≈ sqrt(u / s). So rearranging, u ≈ q² * s.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me check the formula. The standard mutation-selection balance for a recessive lethal allele is u ≈ q² * s, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's u = q² * s, but that depends on the model.

Wait, in the case of a recessive allele with selection against the homozygote, the equilibrium frequency q is given by q ≈ sqrt(u / s). So if I solve for u, it's u = q² * s.

So let's plug in the numbers. q we calculated as approximately 0.0103, and s is 0.8037.

So u = (0.0103)^2 * 0.8037.

Calculating (0.0103)^2: 0.0103 * 0.0103 = approx 0.00010609.

Multiply by 0.8037: 0.00010609 * 0.8037 ≈ 0.0000852.

Wait, that's 8.52 × 10^-5.

Looking at the options, the closest one is option A: 7.82 ×10^-5, and option D:6.27 ×10^-5. Hmm, but our calculation is 8.52e-5, which isn't among the options. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I should use more precise numbers. Let me recalculate.

First, the observed frequency of dwarfs is 10/94075.

10 ÷ 94075 = 0.0001063 approx.

So q² = 0.0001063 → q = sqrt(0.0001063) = approx 0.010311 (since 0.0103^2 is 0.00010609, which is very close to 0.0001063).

So q ≈ 0.010311.

Now, relative fitness (w) of the homozygous recessive is 0.1963. So s = 1 - w = 1 - 0.1963 = 0.8037.

Now, using the mutation-selection balance formula: u = q² * s.

So u = (0.010311)^2 * 0.8037.

Calculating (0.010311)^2: 0.010311 * 0.010311.

Let me compute that more accurately.

0.01 * 0.01 is 0.0001. 0.000311 * 0.010311 is approximately 3.205e-6.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it as (10.311e-3)^2 = (10.311)^2 * 1e-6.

10.311 squared is approximately 106.299. So 106.299e-6 is 0.000106299.

So (0.010311)^2 ≈ 0.000106299.

Now multiply by s=0.8037.

0.000106299 * 0.8037 ≈ ?

Let me compute that:

0.0001 * 0.8037 = 0.00008037.

0.000006299 * 0.8037 ≈ 0.00000506.

Adding them together: 0.00008037 + 0.00000506 ≈ 0.00008543.

So u ≈ 8.543 × 10^-5.

Looking at the options, option A is 7.82e-5, option D is 6.27e-5. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the fitness.

Wait, perhaps the relative fitness is for the allele, not the genotype. Oh, that's a possibility I didn't consider. If the relative fitness is given per allele, that would change things.

Wait, but relative fitness is usually for genotypes, not alleles. So perhaps I got the model wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the selection is against the heterozygotes as well, but since the disease is recessive, probably not. So perhaps the model is only considering homozygotes.

Wait, another approach: the frequency of the recessive allele is q, and the frequency of the homozygous recessive is q². The relative fitness of the homozygous recessive is w = 0.1963, so their contribution to the next generation is lower.

In the absence of mutation, the allele frequency would decrease due to selection. But with mutation, there's an equilibrium where mutation introduces the allele, and selection removes it.

The mutation-selection balance equation is usually q ≈ sqrt(u / s) for a recessive lethal allele. So q² = u / s.

Wait, that would mean u = q² * s.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier, leading to u ≈ 8.5e-5, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is different. Let me look it up in my notes. Oh wait, I can't actually do that right now, but I'll try to think.

Another approach: The allele frequency change due to selection can be modeled. The genotype frequencies before selection are p², 2pq, q². After selection, their frequencies are multiplied by their fitness.

Assuming the fittest genotype is AA (p²) with fitness 1, Aa (2pq) with fitness 1, and aa (q²) with fitness 0.1963.

Wait, no, that's a different scenario. If the Aa genotype is also affected, but since the disease is probably recessive, maybe the Aa genotype has fitness 1, and aa has fitness 0.1963.

So the fitnesses are:

AA: 1

Aa: 1

aa: 0.1963

So the average fitness of the population Wbar is p²*1 + 2pq*1 + q²*0.1963.

But maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps the selection is only against the aa genotype, so the other genotypes have fitness 1.

In that case, the frequency of aa after selection would be q² * 0.1963 / Wbar, where Wbar = p² + 2pq + q² * 0.1963.

But mutation introduces the allele, so the mutation rate u would increase the frequency of a, but selection would decrease it. At equilibrium, the rate of mutation equals the rate of removal by selection.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for mutation load is q ≈ u / s, but that's when selection is against the heterozygotes, which isn't the case here.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look at the options and see which one aligns with my calculation.

Earlier, I got u ≈ 8.5e-5, but the options don't have that. The closest higher option is A:7.82e-5, but that's lower than my calculation. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating q. Let me check that again.

Number of affected (aa) is 10, total births 94,075.

q² = 10 / 94,075 ≈ 0.0001063.

So q = sqrt(0.0001063) ≈ 0.010311.

Yes, that's correct.

Now, selection coefficient s = 1 - w_aa = 1 - 0.1963 = 0.8037.

So u = q² * s = 0.0001063 * 0.8037 ≈ 0.0000853, which is 8.53 × 10^-5.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps there's another approach.

Wait, maybe the formula is u ≈ q * s. So u = q * s.

q is 0.010311, s is 0.8037.

u = 0.010311 * 0.8037 ≈ 0.008283, which is 8.283e-3, which is way higher than any of the options. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is u = (q² * s) / (1 - q²). Wait, that's another possibility. Let me try that.

So u = (q² * s) / (1 - q²).

q² is 0.0001063, s is 0.8037.

1 - q² = 0.9998937.

So u = (0.0001063 * 0.8037) / 0.9998937 ≈ (0.0000853) / 0.9998937 ≈ 0.0000853, same as before.

Still 8.5e-5.

Hmm, perhaps I'm using the wrong model. Maybe the fitness is for the allele, not the genotype. But that would be unusual.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for mutation rate as u ≈ (q) / (s), but that would give u ≈ 0.010311 / 0.8037 ≈ 0.01282, which is 1.282e-2, which is way too high compared to the options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the observed frequency of the allele is q, but mutation is introducing it at rate u, and selection is removing it at rate q² * s.

At equilibrium, mutation rate equals selection pressure: u = q² * s.

Which is what I did earlier, leading to u ≈8.5e-5.

Since none of the options match exactly, perhaps I should check the calculation again for any mistakes.

Wait, perhaps the relative fitness is given as the fitness of the Aa genotype, which would change things. But the question says the relative fitness of the allele, which is a bit confusing. Oh wait, the question says "the relative fitness of the allele for chondrodystrophy is 0.1963." Hmm, that's ambiguous. Do they mean the genotype or the allele's fitness? Because the allele's fitness is a concept in gametic terms, but more often, relative fitness is for genotypes.

Wait, perhaps the relative fitness is for the heterozygote. But if the disease is recessive, the heterozygote would be phenotypically normal, so their fitness might be 1. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the relative fitness given is for the allele, meaning that the fitness of carriers (heterozygotes) is 0.1963. But that doesn't make much sense because carriers usually don't show the disease phenotype for a recessive condition.

Alternatively, perhaps the relative fitness is the fitness of the recessive allele compared to the dominant. But that's not standard terminology.

Wait, perhaps the relative fitness is the fitness of the affected genotype, which is aa. So w_aa = 0.1963.

In that case, s = 1 - w_aa = 0.8037.

So using the mutation-selection balance, u ≈ q² * s = 0.0001063 * 0.8037 ≈ 8.53e-5.

But none of the options match that. The closest option is A:7.82e-5, but that's lower than my result.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Let me compute 10 / 94075 precisely.

10 ÷ 94075 = 0.000106303 approximately.

So q² = 0.000106303.

q = sqrt(0.000106303) ≈ 0.010311.

s = 1 - 0.1963 = 0.8037.

u = q² * s = 0.000106303 * 0.8037.

Let me compute 0.000106303 * 0.8037.

0.0001 * 0.8037 = 0.00008037.

0.000006303 * 0.8037 ≈ 0.00000507.

Adding them together: 0.00008037 + 0.00000507 = 0.00008544.

So u ≈ 8.544e-5.

None of the options match that. The closest is option A:7.82e-5, which is a bit lower.

Wait, perhaps the mutation rate is calculated differently. Maybe using the formula u = (q) * (s) / (1 + s), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is u = q/(1 + q) * s, but that seems arbitrary.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the observed frequency includes both the mutation and selection. So perhaps the formula is q = sqrt(u / (h s)) ), but h is the dominance coefficient.

Wait, for a recessive allele, h=0, meaning that the heterozygote has the same fitness as the dominant homozygote. So the fitnesses are:

AA: 1

Aa: 1

aa: 1 - s.

In that case, the change in allele frequency due to selection can be modeled, but perhaps using the mutation-selection balance equation when h=0.

In that case, the equilibrium frequency q is given by q = sqrt(u/(s)).

So u = q² * s.

Which is what I did earlier.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of q. Let me recalculate 10 / 94075 accurately.

94075 divided by 10 is 9407.5. So 10/94075 = 1 / 9407.5 ≈ 0.000106303.

Yes.

So q is sqrt(0.000106303) ≈ 0.010311.

So u = (0.010311)^2 * 0.8037 ≈ 8.54e-5.

But the options given don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the heterozygote's fitness. If the heterozygote has fitness 0.1963, then h would not be zero. Let's see.

In that case, the fitness of the heterozygote is 0.1963, and the homozygous recessive might have even lower fitness, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the relative fitness given is for the heterozygote, which would change s and h.

But without more information, it's hard to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe the mutation rate is u = (q) * (1 - q) * s, but that seems off.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for mutation load, where the equilibrium frequency q is given by q = u / (h s + (1-h) s q). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler. Maybe the mutation rate equals the frequency of the allele divided by the selection coefficient. So u = q / s.

q is 0.0103, s is 0.8037.

u = 0.0103 / 0.8037 ≈ 0.0128, which is way higher than any option and doesn't make sense because mutation rates are usually very low.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I'll go back to my initial approach, even though the answer isn't among the options. But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps the relative fitness is for the allele, not the genotype. So if the relative fitness of the allele is 0.1963, that would mean that the allele's fitness is 0.1963 compared to the wild type. But that's not standard, as alleles don't have fitness; genotypes do.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using relative fitness as the proportion of the allele in the gene pool after selection, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the number of dwarfs is 10 out of 94,075, so the frequency of the homozygous recessive is 10/94075 ≈ 0.0001063.

The frequency of the allele q is sqrt(0.0001063) ≈ 0.01031.

Assuming mutation-selection balance, u ≈ q^2 * s, where s is the selection coefficient against the aa genotype.

s = 1 - relative fitness of aa = 1 - 0.1963 = 0.8037.

So u ≈ (0.01031)^2 * 0.8037 ≈ 8.54e-5.

But no option matches. Wait, perhaps the question assumes that the observed frequency is the heterozygote? No, because the disease is recessive, so only aa shows the phenotype.

Wait, perhaps I should use a different formula. Let me think about the Hardy-Weinberg equation with selection.

The genotype frequencies after selection are:

AA: p² * 1

Aa: 2pq * 1

aa: q² * 0.1963

The total fitness is Wbar = p² + 2pq + q² * 0.1963.

The frequency of the aa genotype after selection is (q² * 0.1963) / Wbar.

But with mutation, the allele frequency changes. The mutation rate u introduces new a alleles, so the new q is:

q' = (q² * 0.1963 * 2 + u) / Wbar.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the mutation rate is the rate at which new a alleles are introduced, so u = q - (q² * 0.1963) / Wbar.

But I'm not sure. This seems too involved for the problem.

I think I'll stick with my initial approach. Even though the answer isn't among the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute 10/94,075 more accurately.

94,075 ÷ 10 = 9,407.5. So 1/9,407.5 ≈ 0.000106303.

Yes.

q ≈ 0.010311.

s = 0.8037.

u = q² * s = 0.000106303 * 0.8037 ≈ 0.00008543.

That's 8.543 × 10^-5.

Looking at the options, option A is 7.82e-5, which is a bit lower. Maybe I should check if I used the correct selection coefficient.

Wait, perhaps the relative fitness is the fitness of the allele, not the genotype. If the relative fitness of the a allele is 0.1963, then w_a = 0.1963, and the fitness of A is 1. Then the average fitness would be p w_A + q w_a, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the relative fitness is the heterozygote's fitness. If the heterozygote has fitness 0.1963, then h = 0.1963, and s = 1 - h = 0.8037.

But then the equilibrium frequency would be different.

Using the mutation-selection balance for a partially dominant allele, the formula is q ≈ (u) / (h s). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, with h = 0.1963, the fitness of the heterozygote is 0.1963, and the recessive homozygote has fitness 0. Then s = 1 for the recessive.

But this is getting too speculative.

I think I've spent enough time on this, and the best I can do is go with my initial calculation of approximately 8.5e-5, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the formula u = q * s, without the square. So u = 0.010311 * 0.8037 ≈ 0.00828, which is 8.28e-3, but that's way higher than the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is u = q² * (1 - w_aa), which would be the same as before.

Wait, perhaps the formula is u = (q² * s) / (1 - q²). Let me try that.

q² = 0.0001063, s=0.8037, 1 - q² = 0.9998937.

So u = (0.0001063 * 0.8037) / 0.9998937 ≈ 0.0000853 / 0.9998937 ≈ 0.0000853, same as before.

No change.

I think I'm stuck. I'll have to pick the closest option, but none match. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of q.

Wait, perhaps the observed frequency is not q², but the actual frequency of the allele. But no, the disease is recessive, so only aa shows the phenotype, so the frequency of aa is q².

Wait, unless the question is considering X-linked recessive or something else, but the problem doesn't specify.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the formula u = q / (s), which would be 0.0103 / 0.8037 ≈ 0.0128, which is way too high.

I'm really not sure. I think I'll have to go with the initial approach, even though the answer isn't listed. Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the relative fitness is the fitness of the Aa genotype. Let's say w_Aa = 0.1963, and aa has fitness 0. Then s = 1 for aa, and h = 0.1963 for Aa.

In that case, the mutation-selection balance would be different. The equilibrium frequency q would be given by q = (u) / (h s). So q = u / (h).

Because s=1, q = u / h.

So u = q * h.

q is 0.010311, h is 0.1963.

u = 0.010311 * 0.1963 ≈ 0.002026, which is 2.026e-3, still not matching the options.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. I think I'll have to go with my initial calculation of u ≈8.5e-5, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A:7.82e-5, which is the closest. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, and the correct answer is option A.

To determine the mutation rate for the allele causing chondrodystrophy in Denmark, the following steps were taken:

1. **Observed Frequency of Affected Individuals**:  
   The number of dwarfs (affected individuals) is 10 out of 94,075 births.  
   \[
   q^2 = \frac{10}{94,075} \approx 0.0001063
   \]  
   Taking the square root gives the frequency of the recessive allele \( q \):  
   \[
   q = \sqrt{0.0001063} \approx 0.010311
   \]

2. **Relative Fitness and Selection Coefficient**:  
   The relative fitness of the homozygous recessive genotype (\( w_{aa} \)) is given as 0.1963. The selection coefficient \( s \) is calculated as:  
   \[
   s = 1 - w_{aa} = 1 - 0.1963 = 0.8037
   \]

3. **Mutation-Selection Balance**:  
   Under the assumption of mutation-selection balance for a recessive allele, the mutation rate \( u \) is approximated by:  
   \[
   u = q^2 \cdot s
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   u = (0.010311)^2 \cdot 0.8037 \approx 0.0001063 \cdot 0.8037 \approx 0.00008543
   \]  
   This gives:  
   \[
   u \approx 8.54 \times 10^{-5}
   \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated mutation rate (\( 8.54 \times 10^{-5} \)) does not match any of the provided options exactly. However, the closest option is **A: \( 7.82 \times 10^{-5} \)**.

Given the calculations and the provided options, the most reasonable choice is **A**.

**Answer: A**
