Okay, so I have this question about translating the English sentence "No artifacts are people" into predicate logic. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what the sentence means. "No artifacts are people" implies that there's no overlap between the set of artifacts and the set of people. So, if something is an artifact, it cannot be a person, and vice versa. But since the statement is negative, it's more about saying that being an artifact excludes being a person.

I remember that in predicate logic, statements like "No S are P" can be translated using a universal statement that links the two predicates. The general form is usually something like "For all x, if S(x) then not P(x)" or "For all x, S(x) implies ~P(x)". So in this case, S would be "is an artifact" and P would be "is a person".

Looking at the sentence, "No artifacts are people" translates to "For all x, if x is an artifact, then x is not a person." So that would be ∀x (Ax → ~Px), where Ax is "x is an artifact" and Px is "x is a person".

Now, I'll check the options:

Option A: ∀x (~Ax ⊃ Px) → This says if x is not an artifact, then x is a person. That's the converse of what we need. So probably not A.

Option B: ∀x (Px ⊃ ~Ax) → If x is a person, then x is not an artifact. Hmm, that's the inverse of what we need. Because our statement is about artifacts, not people. Wait, but "No artifacts are people" can also mean that people are not artifacts. So maybe B is correct too? Wait, no, because the original statement is about artifacts not being people, not necessarily that people aren't artifacts. But actually, logically, if no artifacts are people, then it's equivalent to saying all people are not artifacts. So B is ∀x (Px → ~Ax), which says if x is a person, x is not an artifact. That's equivalent to the original statement, right?

Wait, but I'm a bit confused here. So the original statement is "No artifacts are people," which is the same as saying "All artifacts are not people," which translates to ∀x (Ax → ~Px). Looking back at the options, I see option F is ∀x (Ax → ~Px), which is exactly that. So F would be correct.

Option B is ∀x (Px → ~Ax), which is also correct because if no artifacts are people, then all people are not artifacts. So both B and F seem correct? But wait, the original statement is about artifacts, so F is the direct translation, whereas B is the contrapositive.

Wait, in predicate logic, "No S are P" is equivalent to "All S are not P," which is ∀x (Sx → ~Px). So in this case, S is artifact (Ax), so ∀x (Ax → ~Px), which is option F. So F is correct.

Wait, but I thought earlier that B was also correct. Let me think again. The statement "No artifacts are people" is equivalent to "All artifacts are non-people," which is F. It's also equivalent to "All people are non-artifacts," which is B. So both F and B are correct? But looking back at the options, the question asks for the best translation. So both F and B seem correct. But wait, the options are distinct, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The statement "No S are P" is equivalent to both "All S are not P" and "All P are not S." So in this case, "No artifacts are people" can be translated as either ∀x (Ax → ~Px) [F] or ∀x (Px → ~Ax) [B]. So both F and B are valid translations. But wait, the options only have one correct answer. So perhaps I need to see which one is more directly the translation.

The original statement is about artifacts, so the more direct translation would be F: ∀x (Ax → ~Px). So F is the correct answer.

Wait, but the user's options are A through J, and the correct answer is F. Let me check the options again:

F: ∀x (Ax ⊃ ~Px) → Yes, which is the same as ∀x (Ax → ~Px). So F is correct.
</think>

The statement "No artifacts are people" translates to the predicate logic ∀x (Ax → ~Px), which is option F.

Answer: F
