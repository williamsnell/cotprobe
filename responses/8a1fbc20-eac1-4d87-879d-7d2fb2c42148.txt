Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and charges. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking about the charges required to produce a specific electric field D. The given field is D = {r + (1/r²)}U(r₀ - r)1_r. Wait, I think U here is the unit step function, so the field is non-zero only when r₀ - r > 0, meaning r < r₀. So the field exists inside a sphere of radius r₀ and is zero outside.

Let me parse the field expression. It looks like D has two parts: one proportional to r and another to 1/r². The unit vector is 1_r. So, the field has a radial component that's a function of r.

I remember that the electric field inside and outside a charged sphere can be determined using Gauss's Law. For a spherical charge distribution, the electric field inside (r < r₀) is different from outside (r > r₀).

The general solution for the electric displacement field D in spherical symmetry would have two parts: a regular solid solution inside the sphere and a dipole-like solution outside. Wait, but in this case, the field is given as D = [r + (1/r²)] U(r₀ - r) ȓ. So it's only non-zero inside the sphere, and outside it's zero.

Wait, that can't be right. Because usually, outside a sphere, the field would fall off as 1/r², but here it's zero beyond r₀. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.

Wait, the field D is given inside the sphere as [r + (1/r²)] ȓ. So, for r < r₀, D is a function of r, and outside (r > r₀), D is zero. So, this suggests that the charge distribution is such that it creates this field inside and nothing outside.

In that case, the charge distribution must be such that it doesn't produce any monopole or dipole fields outside. Wait, but Gauss's Law says that the monopole term (total enclosed charge) would contribute to the field outside. So if the field outside is zero, that suggests that the total enclosed charge must be zero, but there might be a dipole moment or higher terms. Alternatively, perhaps the charge distribution is designed such that the monopole term cancels out.

Wait, but I'm confusing D and E here. D is the displacement field, which includes contributions from free charges, while E considers both free and bound charges. But maybe I should focus on the relation between D and the free charge density.

The expression for D inside would involve a combination of the uniform charge density and any surface charge. Let me recall the form of D inside a uniformly charged sphere. For a uniform charge density ρ₀, D inside would be (ρ₀ r /3) ȓ. But our D has terms in r and 1/r², which suggests that it's a combination of a uniform charge density and perhaps a different charge distribution.

Wait, maybe the charge distribution isn't just a uniform volume charge. It could have a uniform density and a surface charge. Because if you have a uniform density inside, that would give a D proportional to r, and a surface charge would add another term.

So, let's model D inside as the sum of two contributions: one from a uniform charge density ρ₀ and another from a surface charge σ at r = r₀.

The general solution for D inside a sphere with a uniform charge density ρ₀ would be D₁ = (ρ₀ r /3) ȓ. The surface charge would contribute another term. The presence of a surface charge can be found by considering the discontinuity in the radial component of D at r = r₀. The surface charge σ is related to the jump in D_r there.

Wait, the general form for D inside when you have both a uniform volume charge and a surface charge would be D(r) = (A r + B) ȓ, where A and B are constants determined by the boundary conditions.

In our case, D(r) = [r + (1/r²)] ȓ. Hmm, that doesn't match the expected form of a linear function of r. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the given D again. Oh wait, the given D is D = {r + (1/r²)} U(r₀ - r) ȓ. So inside (r < r₀), D is {r + (1/r²)} ȓ. That seems a bit odd because the 1/r² term would typically be associated with a point charge, but here it's inside a sphere. Hmm, maybe I need to model this as a combination of a volume charge and a surface charge.

Wait a second, perhaps I should write the general solution for D inside a sphere as D_in = (α r + β) ȓ, where α and β are constants determined by the boundary conditions at r = r₀ and as r approaches zero.

At r = r₀, the radial component of D must be continuous if there's a surface charge. The discontinuity in D_r is σ_free / ε₀. So, the jump in D_r at r = r₀ is σ_free / ε₀.

Wait, but D_in(r₀) = α r₀ + β. The D_outside would be zero, as per the given problem. So, the jump would be (α r₀ + β) - 0 = σ_free / ε₀. So σ_free = ε₀ (α r₀ + β).

Another condition comes from the behavior as r approaches zero. For the electric displacement D, the term in 1/r² would typically come from a point charge at the origin. So perhaps the 1/r² term is due to a point charge Q at the origin, which would contribute D = (Q / (4π ε₀ r²)) ȓ. But in this problem, D has a term r and 1/r².

Wait, maybe I should think of D as the sum of two fields: one due to a uniform charge density in the volume and another due to a surface charge and a point charge.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1/r² term arises from a point charge at the origin, and the r term arises from a uniform charge density in the volume. But I'm not sure. Let me try to model this.

Let me assume that the total D inside is the sum of two contributions: D1 from a uniform volume charge and D2 from a surface charge.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should approach this using the general solution for D inside a sphere.

In spherical coordinates, the general solution for D inside (r < r₀) is D_in = (A r + B) ȓ. The solution outside (r > r₀) would be D_out = (C / r² + D / r) ȓ. But in our case, D_out is zero, so C and D must be zero. That can't be right because the given D_out is zero, but the given D_in has r and 1/r² terms. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read the question again.

Wait, the question says D = {r + (1/r²)} U(r₀ - r) ȓ. So D is non-zero only inside the sphere of radius r₀. Outside, it's zero. So the expression inside is D = (r + 1/r²) ȓ. So that's inside.

So, D_in = (r + 1/r²) ȓ.

Now, I need to find the charge distribution that produces this D field inside the sphere and zero outside.

The general solution for D inside a sphere with a charge distribution would be D_in = (α r + β) ȓ.

Wait, but our D_in has terms in r and 1/r². That doesn't fit the general form of a linear function of r. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the given D is a combination of a uniform charge density and a dipole term. Alternatively, maybe the charge distribution isn't just a uniform volume charge but includes a surface charge.

Wait, let me think again. The general solution for D inside a sphere with a uniform volume charge density ρ is D_in = (ρ r / 3) ȓ. So that's a linear term in r. But our D_in has both r and 1/r² terms, which suggests that there's another contribution, perhaps from a surface charge.

Alternatively, maybe the charge distribution includes a uniform density and a point charge at the origin.

Wait, perhaps the 1/r² term in D_in is due to a point charge at the origin, and the r term comes from a uniform volume charge. Let me try that approach.

So, D_in would be the sum of D from the uniform volume charge and the point charge.

D_uniform = (ρ r / 3) ȓ,

D_point = (Q / (4π ε₀ r²)) ȓ.

So the total D_in would be D = [ (ρ r / 3) + (Q/(4π ε₀ r²)) ] ȓ.

Comparing this to the given D_in = (r + 1/r²) ȓ, we can set up equations by matching coefficients.

Assuming ε₀ = 1 for simplicity (since units might be in Gaussian or some other system where constants are absorbed), then:

(ρ / 3) r + (Q / (4π)) (1/r²) = r + (1/r²).

So matching terms:

ρ / 3 = 1 ⇒ ρ = 3 C/m³.

And,

Q / (4π) = 1 ⇒ Q = 4π coulombs.

So this suggests that there is a uniform charge density ρ = 3 C/m³ in the volume, and a point charge Q = 4π C at the origin.

But wait, that's just two parts. What about the surface charge?

Wait, because if we have a uniform charge density in the volume, then at r = r₀, the electric displacement D must be continuous with the outside. But in our case, the outside D is zero. So the D at r = r₀ from the uniform charge would be (ρ r₀ /3) ȓ. But since D_out is zero, this suggests that (ρ r₀ /3) must be zero. But we found ρ =3, so this would require r₀ to be zero, which isn't the case. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Because if D_out is zero, then at r = r₀, the radial component of D must match. From the inside, D_in at r = r₀ is (ρ r₀ /3) + (Q/(4π r₀²)). From outside, D_out is zero. So their difference gives the surface charge.

The surface charge σ is related to the discontinuity in D_r by σ = ε₀ (D_out_r - D_in_r). But since D_out_r is zero, σ = - ε₀ D_in_r.

Wait, in Gaussian units, the relation is D_out - D_in = σ. So, D_out_r - D_in_r = σ. Since D_out_r is zero, σ = - D_in_r.

So σ = - [ (ρ r₀ /3) + (Q/(4π r₀²)) ].

But from earlier, we have ρ =3 and Q =4π. Plugging in,

σ = - [ (3 r₀ /3 ) + (4π/(4π r₀²)) ] = - [ r₀ + (1/r₀²) ].

So the surface charge density is σ = - [ r₀ + (1/r₀²) ].

But wait, surface charge density should have units of C/m², but the terms here are in meters and 1/m². Hmm, perhaps I messed up the units by assuming ε₀=1. Let me think again.

In SI units, the relation is D_out_r - D_in_r = σ_free. So, the jump in D_r is σ_free.

In our case, D_out_r is zero, so σ_free = - D_in_r.

D_in_r at r = r₀ is ( (ρ r₀)/3 ) + (Q/(4π ε₀ r₀² )).

So σ_free = - [ (ρ r₀)/(3 ε₀) ) + (Q)/(4π ε₀ r₀²) ) ].

Wait, but I might have gotten mixed up with the units. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to proceed using the approach where the charge density is found by taking the divergence of D.

The divergence of D gives the free charge density ρ_free:

∇·D = ρ_free.

In spherical coordinates, for a function D(r) ȓ,

∇·D = (1/r²) d/dr (r² D_r).

So, D_r = r + 1/r².

So,

∇·D = (1/r²) d/dr [ r² (r + 1/r²) ].

Let me compute that step by step.

First, compute r² D_r:

r² D_r = r² (r + 1/r²) = r^3 + 1.

Then, take the derivative with respect to r:

d/dr (r^3 +1) = 3 r².

Now, multiply by (1/r²):

∇·D = (3 r²) / r² = 3.

So, ρ_free = 3 C/m³.

Wait, that's the free charge density inside the sphere. So the volume charge density is uniform and equal to 3 C/m³.

But what about the surface charge? The surface charge σ can be found by looking at the discontinuity in D_r at r = r₀.

As D is continuous across the surface, D_in_r(r₀) = D_out_r(r₀). But D_out is zero, so D_in_r(r₀) must be zero.

Wait, no. Wait, D_in_r is (r + 1/r²). At r = r₀, D_in_r(r₀) = r₀ + 1/r₀².

But D_out_r is zero, so the discontinuity in D_r is ΔD_r = D_out_r - D_in_r = - (r₀ + 1/r₀²).

In SI units, the surface charge density σ is equal to the discontinuity in the electric displacement D's normal component. So,

σ = D_out_r(r₀⁺) - D_in_r(r₀⁻) = 0 - (r₀ + 1/r₀²) = - (r₀ + 1/r₀²).

So the surface charge density is σ = - (r₀ + 1/r₀²) C/m².

Wait, but wait a second—this would be the case if the surface charge is on the sphere of radius r₀. So, the charge on the surface is σ times the surface area, which is 4π r₀².

So the total surface charge Q_surface = σ * 4π r₀² = - (r₀ + 1/r₀²) *4π r₀² = -4π (r₀^3 + 1).

Hmm, but let's also consider the volume charge. The volume charge is ρ = 3 C/m³, so the total volume charge Q_volume = ρ * (4/3) π r₀³ = 3 * (4/3 π r₀³) )= 4 π r₀³.

Wait, but earlier I thought there was a point charge at the origin, but that might not be the case. Let me check.

Wait, in the earlier approach, I considered D as the sum of a uniform volume charge and a point charge, but that led to a problem with the surface charge. Now, using the divergence approach, I found that the volume charge is uniform and equal to 3 C/m³, and the surface charge is σ = - (r₀ + 1/r₀²). But that leaves the possibility of a point charge. Wait, because the D field includes a 1/r² term, which usually comes from a point charge. But in this case, the 1/r² term is inside the sphere, which is a bit confusing.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the divergence approach. Let me redo it.

Compute ∇·D:

D = (r + 1/r²) ȓ for r < r₀.

So,

∇·D = (1/r²) d/dr [ r² (r + 1/r²) ].

Compute r² (r + 1/r²) = r^3 + (r²)(1/r²) )= r^3 + 1.

Then, d/dr (r^3 +1) = 3r².

So ∇·D = 3r² / r² = 3.

Which means ρ_free = 3 C/m³.

So the volume charge is uniform, 3 C/m³.

But then, the D field is D = (r + 1/r²) ȓ, which implies that the field has a term linear in r (from the uniform charge) and a term 1/r² which would typically come from a point charge. But since we're inside the sphere, a point charge at the origin would contribute to D as (Q/(4π ε₀ r²)) ȓ. But in our case, D includes this term, so perhaps there's a point charge at the origin in addition to the uniform charge.

Wait, but if there's a uniform charge density, the field inside would be (ρ r)/(3 ε₀) ȓ. If there's a point charge Q at the origin, its contribution would be (Q/(4π ε₀ r²)) ȓ. So the total D would be the sum of these two.

So,

D_total = [ (ρ r)/(3 ε₀) ) + (Q/(4π ε₀ r²)) ] ȓ.

Comparing this to the given D = (r + 1/r²) ȓ,

We can set:

(ρ)/(3 ε₀) = 1,

and

Q/(4π ε₀) = 1.

Assuming ε₀ = 1 (as in Gaussian units, perhaps?), then ρ = 3 C/m³, and Q =4π C.

So, the charge distribution would consist of a uniform volume charge density ρ=3 C/m³, a surface charge σ, and a point charge Q=4π C at the origin.

Wait, but earlier when I considered the surface charge, I found that σ = - (r₀ + 1/r₀²). Let me check that again.

The surface charge σ is the discontinuity in D_r across the surface. So,

σ = D_out_r(r₀⁺) - D_in_r(r₀⁻) = 0 - (r₀ + 1/r₀²) )= - (r₀ + 1/r₀²).

So, the surface charge density is σ = - (r₀ + 1/r₀²) C/m².

But wait, the problem is that the presence of a point charge at the origin would affect the surface charge calculation. Because the point charge contributes to D inside the sphere, but the surface charge would need to cancel the contribution from the uniform charge at r = r₀.

Wait, perhaps I should model the total D as:

D_in = (ρ r/3) ȓ + (Q/(4π r²)) ȓ,

and D_out = 0.

So, at r = r₀,

D_in_r = (ρ r₀/3) + (Q/(4π r₀²)).

But since D_out_r is zero, the surface charge σ is:

σ = D_out_r - D_in_r = 0 - [ (ρ r₀/3) + (Q/(4π r₀²)) ) ].

But from earlier, we have:

From the divergence, ρ =3,

and from the 1/r² term, Q=4π.

So,

σ = - [ (3 r₀ /3 ) + (4π/(4π r₀²)) ) ]

= - [ r₀ + (1/r₀²) ].

So the surface charge is σ = - (r₀ + 1/r₀²) C/m².

Now, the total charge on the surface is σ * 4π r₀² = - (r₀ + 1/r₀²) * 4π r₀².

Which simplifies to:

-4π ( r₀^3 + 1 ) coulombs.

But wait, that seems a bit odd. Let me think about the total charge enclosed.

The total charge enclosed within radius r₀ would be the sum of the volume charge and the surface charge and the point charge.

Wait, but the point charge Q is at the origin, so it's within the sphere. The volume charge is uniform throughout the sphere, and the surface charge is on the surface.

Wait, no—the surface charge is on the sphere, so it's part of the enclosed charge.

So the total charge inside r₀ is:

Q_total = Q_volume + Q_surface + Q_point.

Wait, but Q_point is the charge at the origin, which is inside the sphere, so it's included in the total charge.

Wait, but from Gauss's Law, the total enclosed charge must be zero because D_out is zero. Because, in Gauss's Law, ∮ D · dA = Q_free_enclosed.

Since D_out is zero, the flux through any Gaussian surface outside the sphere is zero, implying Q_free_enclosed = 0.

So,

Q_volume + Q_surface + Q_point = 0.

Compute each term:

Q_volume = ρ * (4/3 π r₀³) )= 3 * (4/3 π r₀³) )=4 π r₀³.

Q_surface = σ * 4 π r₀² = [ - (r₀ + 1/r₀²) ] * 4 π r₀² = -4 π (r₀^3 + 1 ).

Q_point = Q =4 π.

So,

4 π r₀³ -4 π (r₀^3 +1 ) +4 π = 4 π r₀³ -4 π r₀³ -4 π +4 π =0.

Which satisfies Gauss's Law. So that works.

So, the charges are:

- A uniform charge density ρ=3 C/m³ inside the sphere.

- A surface charge σ= - (r₀ +1/r₀²) C/m² on the sphere of radius r₀.

- A point charge Q=4 π C at the origin.

Looking at the options, option J says:

J: A uniform charge density of 3 C/m³, a surface charge of - [r₀ + (1/r₀²)] on the sphere of radius r = r₀, and an additional point charge of 4π coulombs at the origin.

Yes, that matches our findings.
</think>

To determine the charges required to produce the given electric displacement field **D = {r + (1/r²)} U(r₀ - r) ȓ**, we analyze the field inside and outside the sphere of radius \( r_0 \). The field is non-zero inside the sphere (\( r < r_0 \)) and zero outside (\( r > r_0 \)).

### Key Observations:
1. **Inside the Sphere (\( r < r_0 \)):**
   - The field has two terms: \( r \) (linear in \( r \)) and \( 1/r^2 \) (inverse square). 
   - The \( r \)-dependent term suggests a **uniform volume charge density**.
   - The \( 1/r^2 \)-dependent term suggests a **point charge** at the origin.

2. **Outside the Sphere (\( r > r_0 \)):**
   - The field is zero, implying no monopole (total charge) contribution outside the sphere.

### Analysis:
#### 1. **Uniform Volume Charge Density (\( \rho \)):**
   Using Gauss's Law inside the sphere, the field due to a uniform charge density \( \rho \) is \( D_{\text{uniform}} = \frac{\rho r}{3} \hat{r} \). Comparing this with the given \( D \)-field, we match the \( r \)-dependent term:
   \[
   \frac{\rho}{3} = 1 \implies \rho = 3 \, \text{C/m}^3.
   \]

#### 2. **Point Charge at the Origin (\( Q \)):**
   The \( 1/r^2 \)-dependent term in \( D \) is due to a point charge \( Q \) at the origin. The field contribution is:
   \[
   D_{\text{point}} = \frac{Q}{4\pi r^2} \hat{r}.
   \]
   Matching this with the given \( D \)-field:
   \[
   \frac{Q}{4\pi} = 1 \implies Q = 4\pi \, \text{C}.
   \]

#### 3. **Surface Charge (\( \sigma \)):**
   The discontinuity in \( D_r \) at \( r = r_0 \) gives the surface charge density:
   \[
   \sigma = -\left( \rho r_0 + \frac{Q}{4\pi r_0^2} \right).
   \]
   Substituting \( \rho = 3 \, \text{C/m}^3 \) and \( Q = 4\pi \, \text{C} \):
   \[
   \sigma = -\left( 3r_0 + \frac{4\pi}{4\pi r_0^2} \right) = -\left( r_0 + \frac{1}{r_0^2} \right) \, \text{C/m}^2.
   \]

#### 4. **Consistency Check with Gauss's Law:**
   The total free charge enclosed within \( r_0 \) must be zero (since \( D_{\text{out}} = 0 \)):
   \[
   Q_{\text{total}} = Q_{\text{volume}} + Q_{\text{surface}} + Q_{\text{point}}.
   \]
   - \( Q_{\text{volume}} = \rho \cdot \frac{4}{3}\pi r_0^3 = 4\pi r_0^3 \),
   - \( Q_{\text{surface}} = \sigma \cdot 4\pi r_0^2 = -4\pi (r_0^3 + 1) \),
   - \( Q_{\text{point}} = 4\pi \).

   Substituting:
   \[
   Q_{\text{total}} = 4\pi r_0^3 - 4\pi (r_0^3 + 1) + 4\pi = 0,
   \]
   confirming the charge distribution is consistent with Gauss's Law.

### Conclusion:
The charges required are:
- A **uniform charge density** of \( 3 \, \text{C/m}^3 \) inside the sphere,
- A **surface charge** of \( -\left( r_0 + \frac{1}{r_0^2} \right) \, \text{C/m}^2 \) on the sphere of radius \( r_0 \),
- An **additional point charge** of \( 4\pi \, \text{C} \) at the origin.

This matches **Option J**.

**Answer: J**
