Answer:

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which capacity Carruther's assumes that animals lack. The options are A through D, each representing a different capacity. I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy, but I'll try to think this through.

First, I remember that Carruther's is a name that comes up in discussions about animal cognition and ethics. I think he's an philosopher who argues about the mental capacities of animals. From what I recall, Carruther's has some specific views on whether animals can have certain kinds of mental states or capacities.

Looking at the options:

A: the capacity for suffering. I think most philosophers, including those who argue about animal rights, would say that animals can suffer. But I'm not sure if Carruther's is one who denies this. Maybe he argues that animals don't have higher-order thoughts, but still feel pain.

B: the capacity for practical reasoning. Practical reasoning is about making decisions based on reasons, like knowing what to do in a situation. Humans do this all the time, but do animals? Carruther's might say that animals can't reason in this way because they lack the cognitive structures, like language or abstract thought, necessary for practical reasoning.

C: the capacity for rational agency. Rational agency involves acting based on reasons, understanding means and ends, and perhaps having intentions. This seems similar to practical reasoning, but maybe broader. Carruther's might argue that animals don't have this because they can't engage in the kind of reasoning required for rational agency.

D: the capacity for conscious experience. This is about being aware and having experiences. I think Carruther's actually argues against some views that animals lack consciousness. He might say that animals do have conscious experiences, so this isn't the one he claims they lack.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. I think Carruther's is associated with the idea that animals lack higher-order thoughts, like reflecting on their own mental states. But do they lack practical reasoning or rational agency? Practical reasoning is more about applying reason to actions, while rational agency is about being an agent who acts rationally.

I think Carruther's might argue that animals lack the capacity for rational agency because they can't understand the reasons behind their actions in the way humans do. They might act in ways that serve their purposes, but without the reflective, reasoning aspect that humans have.

Alternatively, maybe he's more about the absence of practical reasoning. But I'm not sure. Another angle: in his book "The Animals Issue," Carruther's discusses the mental lives of animals. He might argue that animals lack the capacity for rational agency because they can't engage in the kind of reasoning that involves understanding rules, implications, and justifying actions.

So, putting it all together, I think the answer is either B or C. Since the question is about which capacity Carruther's assumes animals lack, and given that practical reasoning is a subset of rational agency, perhaps he's more focused on rational agency. Therefore, the answer might be C: the capacity for rational agency.

Carruther's argues that animals lack the capacity for rational agency, as they cannot engage in the reflective, reasoned decision-making that humans do.

Answer: C
