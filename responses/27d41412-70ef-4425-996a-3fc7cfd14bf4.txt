Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with pH calculations, especially when it involves weak acids or bases. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The problem says that a hydrogen peroxide solution is 30% by weight H₂O₂. The density is given as 1.11 g/cm³, and the dissociation constant (Ka) is 1.0 × 10^-12. I need to find the pH of this solution.

First, I remember that hydrogen peroxide is a weak acid. It dissociates in water, but since the Ka is really small (1e-12), it's not going to dissociate much. So the solution should be slightly acidic, but not extremely so. Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, wait. I think I might have this mixed up. Let me think: H₂O₂ can act as both an acid and a base because it's amphiprotic. But in this case, since we're dealing with its acidic behavior (dissociation), we'll consider it as a weak acid.

But wait, when I think about H₂O₂, it's commonly used as a bleach and is known to be a weak oxidizing agent. I've heard that it's a weak acid, so it should donate a proton. So, in water, it dissociates into H+ and HO₂^-.

The next step is to figure out the concentration of H₂O₂ in the solution. The solution is 30% by weight, so that means in 100 grams of solution, 30 grams are H₂O₂. The density is 1.11 g/cm³, which is the same as g/mL. So, the volume of 100 grams of solution is mass divided by density: 100 g / 1.11 g/mL ≈ 90.09 mL, which is 0.09009 liters.

Now, the concentration (molarity) of H₂O₂ is moles per liter. The molar mass of H₂O₂ is (2*1) + (16*2) = 34 g/mol. So, moles = 30 g / 34 g/mol ≈ 0.88235 mol. Then, concentration M = 0.88235 mol / 0.09009 L ≈ 9.79 M. Wait, that seems pretty high. Wait, 30% by weight in a solution with that density would give a high concentration, I guess. Hmm.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the calculation. 30 grams in 100 grams total solution. The volume is 100g / 1.11 g/mL ≈ 90.09 mL. So, moles are 30 / 34 ≈ 0.88235. Divided by 0.09009 L gives 9.79 M. Yeah, that seems right.

Now, since H₂O₂ is a weak acid, it dissociates as H₂O₂ ↔ 2H+ + O₂^2−. Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, the correct dissociation is H₂O₂ → 2H+ + O₂^2−? No, wait, that can't be right because that would release two protons, but the formula is H₂O₂, so it's more likely to donate one proton. Oh wait, maybe the correct dissociation is H₂O₂ ↔ 2H+ + O₂? No, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The correct dissociation of H₂O₂ is H₂O₂ ↔ 2H+ + O₂^2−? Or is it H₂O₂ ↔ H+ + HO₂^-?

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me get this right. H₂O₂ can act as a weak acid, but each molecule can donate one proton, so the dissociation is H₂O₂ → 2H+ + O₂. No, wait, another way: it's more accurate to write it as H₂O₂ ↔ H+ + HOO^- (hydroperoxide ion). Or perhaps it's H₂O₂ ↔ 2H+ + O₂. But I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, another source I recall says that H₂O₂ can dissociate into H+ and HO₂^- as a first step, but the second dissociation would be the HO₂^- losing another H+. But maybe for the purpose of this problem, we can consider the first dissociation only, as the second would be negligible.

Wait, but the problem gives a dissociation constant of 1.0e-12, which probably refers to the first dissociation. So, the reaction is H₂O₂ ↔ H+ + HO₂^-.

So, the Ka is given as 1.0e-12. Since Ka is small, the dissociation is minimal, so we can make the approximation that the concentration of H₂O₂ remains almost the same, and the H+ concentration is equal to the square root of (Ka * C), where C is the initial concentration of H₂O₂.

Wait, but wait, for a weak acid, the formula is [H+] = sqrt(Ka * C) when the dissociation is small, and the initial concentration is much larger than the change. So, in this case, C is 9.79 M, and Ka is 1e-12.

So, [H+] ≈ sqrt(1e-12 * 9.79) = sqrt(9.79e-12) ≈ sqrt(9.79) * 1e-6 ≈ 3.13e-6 M. So, pH would be -log(3.13e-6) ≈ 5.5.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 5.5, and option F is 3.13. Hmm, but wait, let me think again. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let's go through the steps again.

1. Calculate the molarity of H₂O₂.

Mass of H₂O₂ in 100g solution: 30g.

Density is 1.11g/mL → volume is 100g / 1.11g/mL ≈ 90.09 mL → 0.09009 L.

Moles of H₂O₂: 30g / 34g/mol ≈ 0.88235 mol.

Molarity = 0.88235 / 0.09009 ≈ 9.79 M.

So that's correct.

2. The dissociation equation: H₂O₂ ↔ H+ + HO₂^-.

Ka = 1e-12.

3. Let x be [H+] = [HO₂^-].

So, the expression is Ka = (x^2) / (C - x), where C is initial concentration (9.79 M). Since Ka is very small, x is much smaller than C, so C - x ≈ C.

Thus, x^2 ≈ Ka * C → x = sqrt(Ka * C) = sqrt(1e-12 * 9.79) ≈ sqrt(9.79e-12) ≈ 3.13e-6 M.

pH = -log(3.13e-6) ≈ 5.5.

Wait, but wait, 3.13e-6 is approximately 1e-5.5, so pH is about 5.5, which matches option C.

But I'm a bit confused because when I calculated the concentration, I thought 9.79 M was very high, but maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that H₂O₂ fully dissociates into two H+ ions, but I don't think that's the case because the Ka is given as 1e-12, which is very small, so only a tiny amount dissociates.

Wait, another possibility: the dissociation of H₂O₂ in water can produce two H+ ions. So, if the reaction is H₂O₂ → 2H+ + O₂^2−, then the concentration of H+ would be 2x, and the expression for Ka would be ( (2x)^2 ) / C, which is (4x²)/C. So in that case, Ka = 4x² / C.

Then, solving for x:

x² = (Ka * C) / 4 → x = sqrt( (1e-12 * 9.79) /4 ) → x = sqrt( 2.4475e-13 ) ≈ 1.564e-6. Then [H+] = 2x = 3.13e-6, same as before. So pH is same as before, 5.5.

Wait, that's the same result, so whether I consider one H+ per molecule or two, the [H+] ends up the same because the way I set up the equation accounts for that. So, the pH comes out to 5.5, which is option C.

But wait, another thought: sometimes, when a substance can donate more than one proton, the overall calculation might be different, but in this case, since it's a weak acid, we're only considering the first dissociation, so perhaps the assumption is that each H₂O₂ molecule donates one H+.

Wait, but in reality, the first dissociation is H₂O₂ → H+ + HO₂^−, and the second would be HO₂^− → H+ + O₂^2−, with a different Ka, which is probably much smaller. But the problem only gives one dissociation constant, so maybe it's for the first step. So in that case, each H₂O₂ releases one H+.

Therefore, the calculation would be correct, leading to pH ≈ 5.5, which is option C.

Looking at the options again:

Options:

A: 4.27

B: 2.07

C:5.5

D:1.0 ×10^-12

E:9.79

F:3.13

G:7.45

H:10.5

I:6.8

J:8.34

So the correct answer should be C:5.5.

To determine the pH of a 30% by weight hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) solution with a density of 1.11 g/cm³ and a dissociation constant (Ka) of 1.0 × 10⁻¹², the following steps are taken:

1. **Calculate the molarity of H₂O₂**:  
   - Mass of H₂O₂ in 100 g of solution: 30 g.  
   - Volume of solution: \( \frac{100 \, \text{g}}{1.11 \, \text{g/mL}} \approx 90.09 \, \text{mL} = 0.09009 \, \text{L} \).  
   - Moles of H₂O₂: \( \frac{30 \, \text{g}}{34 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.88235 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Molarity: \( \frac{0.88235 \, \text{mol}}{0.09009 \, \text{L}} \approx 9.79 \, \text{M} \).

2. **Determine the dissociation of H₂O₂**:  
   H₂O₂ is a weak acid and dissociates as \( \text{H₂O₂} \leftrightarrow \text{H⁺} + \text{HO₂⁻} \).  
   The dissociation constant is \( K_a = 1.0 \times 10^{-12} \).  

3. **Calculate the concentration of H⁺ ions**:  
   Using the approximation for weak acids, \( [\text{H⁺}] = \sqrt{K_a \cdot C} \), where \( C = 9.79 \, \text{M} \):  
   \[
   [\text{H⁺}] = \sqrt{(1.0 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot 9.79} \approx \sqrt{9.79 \times 10^{-12}} \approx 3.13 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
   \]

4. **Calculate the pH**:  
   \[
   \text{pH} = -\log(3.13 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.5.
   \]

Thus, the pH of the solution is approximately **5.5**, which corresponds to option **C**.
