Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the angle of twist in a shaft due to torsion. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my mechanics, but I'll give it a shot.

First, the problem says there's a shaft with a power of 30 hp at 150 rpm. The shaft is 2.5 inches in diameter, and there are two pulleys 18 inches apart causing torsional deflection. We need to find the angle of twist, and the shear modulus is given as 11×10^6 psi. The options are from A to J, so I'll have to pick the correct letter once I calculate it.

Alright, let's start by recalling the formula for the angle of twist. I remember that the formula for the angle of twist (θ) in a shaft is θ = (T * L) / (G * J), where T is the torque, L is the length of the shaft between the two points (pulleys here), G is the shear modulus, and J is the polar moment of inertia of the shaft's cross-section.

So, the first thing I need is the torque (T). Torque can be calculated from the power and the rotational speed. The formula I remember is Power (P) = Torque (T) × angular velocity (ω). But wait, power here is in horsepower, and the speed is in rpm. I need to convert these into consistent units, probably to foot-pounds and radians per second.

Let me jot down the given values:

- Power (P) = 30 hp
- Speed (N) = 150 rpm
- Diameter (d) = 2.5 inches → radius (r) = 1.25 inches
- Length between pulleys (L) = 18 inches
- Shear modulus (G) = 11×10^6 psi

I think the first step is to convert horsepower to foot-pounds per second. I recall that 1 horsepower is approximately 550 foot-pounds per second. So, 30 hp would be 30 × 550 = 16,500 ft·lb/s.

Next, I need the angular velocity (ω) in radians per second. Since the shaft is rotating at 150 rpm, I can convert that by multiplying by 2π/60. So ω = 150 × (2π)/60 = (150 × π)/30 = 5π radians per second. That's about 15.70796 rad/s.

Now, using P = T × ω, I can solve for T. Rearranging, T = P / ω. So T = 16,500 / (5π). Let me compute that. 16,500 divided by approximately 15.70796 gives me roughly 1050.4 ft·lb. Let me check the calculation again: 16500 ÷ (5 * 3.1416) ≈ 16500 ÷ 15.708 ≈ 1050.5 ft·lb.

Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. 5π is approximately 15.708. 16,500 divided by 15.708 is indeed about 1050.5. Yes, that seems correct.

Now, I need to find the polar moment of inertia (J) for the shaft. The formula for a solid shaft is J = (π * r^4) / 2. The radius r is 1.25 inches. Let me compute that. r^4 is (1.25)^4. Let's see: 1.25 squared is 1.5625, so squared again is about 2.44140625. So J = (π * 2.44140625) / 2 ≈ (3.1416 * 2.4414) / 2 ≈ 7.6969 / 2 ≈ 3.8485 in^4.

Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check the formula for J. Oh yes, J = (π * d^4) / (32), where d is diameter. Maybe that's a better way to compute it. Let me try that. d = 2.5 inches, so d^4 is (2.5)^4 = 39.0625. So J = (π * 39.0625) / 32 ≈ (3.1416 * 39.0625) / 32. Let's compute 39.0625 * 3.1416 ≈ 122.718. Divided by 32, J ≈ 3.835 in^4. That's close to what I got before, so that's correct.

Next, torque T is 1050.5 ft·lb. But wait, I think I made a mistake here. Torque is usually in inch-pounds when working with inches, right? Because if L is in inches, then J is in in^4, so units should be consistent. So I think I should convert T from ft·lb to in·lb. Since 1 ft = 12 inches, 1050.5 ft·lb = 1050.5 * 12 in·lb ≈ 12,606 in·lb. Oh, right! I completely forgot that part. So T is 12,606 in·lb.

Now, plug all into the angle of twist formula: θ = (T * L) / (G * J). So T is 12,606 in·lb, L is 18 inches. G is 11×10^6 psi, and J is 3.835 in^4.

Calculating numerator: 12,606 * 18 = let's see, 12,606 * 10 is 126,060, 12,606 * 8 is 100,848. So total is 226,908 in^2·lb.

Denominator: G * J = 11×10^6 psi * 3.835 in^4 = 11e6 * 3.835 = 42,185,000 psi·in^4. Wait, but psi is lb/in^2, so the units would be (lb/in^2) * in^4 = lb·in^2. So the units for θ would be in^2·lb / (lb·in^2) = radians. That makes sense.

So θ = 226,908 / 42,185,000 ≈ let's compute that. 226908 ÷ 42,185,000 ≈ 0.005376 radians.

To convert radians to degrees, multiply by (180/π). So 0.005376 * (180/3.1416) ≈ 0.005376 * 57.2958 ≈ approximately 0.308 degrees.

Looking at the options, B is 0.31 degree, and J is 0.41, so 0.308 is closest to 0.31, which is option B.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake in unit conversions or arithmetic.

Let me recalculate the torque again. Power is 30 hp, which is 30 * 550 = 16,500 ft·lb/s. Angular velocity is 150 rpm = 150 * 2π /60 = 5π rad/s. So torque T = 16500 / 5π ≈ 16500 / 15.70796 ≈ 1050.5 ft·lb. Converting to in·lb: 1050.5 * 12 = 12,606 in·lb. That seems correct.

J using d^4: (2.5)^4 = 39.0625, so J = π * 39.0625 / 32 = 3.835 in^4. Correct.

Then, θ = (12606 * 18) / (11e6 * 3.835) = 226,908 / 42,185,000 ≈ 0.005376 radians. Converting to degrees: 0.005376 * (180/π) ≈ 0.308 degrees. So 0.31 degrees is option B.

The angle of twist in the shaft is calculated using the formula θ = (T * L) / (G * J), where T is the torque, L is the shaft length, G is the shear modulus, and J is the polar moment of inertia. Converting the given power and speed into consistent units, the torque T is found to be 12,606 in·lb. The polar moment of inertia J is calculated as 3.835 in⁴. Substituting these values into the formula yields an angle of twist of approximately 0.31 degrees.
