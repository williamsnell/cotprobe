Okay, so I've got this biology question here about transfer RNA (tRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) in horse and human cells. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my genetics, but let me think this through.

First, I remember that both tRNA and mRNA are types of RNA, which are nucleic acids. They have different roles, though. tRNA is involved in translating mRNA into proteins during protein synthesis. Each tRNA molecule has an anticodon that matches the codon on the mRNA, which is a sequence of three nucleotides.

Now, the question is asking whether tRNA and mRNA would be the same in horse and human cells. I think about the genetic code. I remember that the genetic code is pretty much universal, right? That means that the codons on mRNA are interpreted the same way across different species. So, for example, the codon AUG always codes for methionine, whether it's in a human or a horse.

But wait, does that mean the mRNA sequences themselves are identical? No, because the genes for proteins would differ between species. Humans and horses have different DNA, so the mRNA transcribed from their genes would be different. For example, the mRNA for a human's hemoglobin is different from that of a horse's. However, the basic structure of mRNA, like the presence of the codons and the way they're read, is the same.

What about tRNA? Well, tRNA's job is to bring the right amino acids to the ribosome based on the mRNA codons. Since the genetic code is universal, the tRNA anticodons should be similar across species to recognize the same codons. But wait, in some cases, there might be slight variations. For instance, I think some tRNAs can have different nucleotides in the anticodon region but still recognize the same codon due to wobble pairing. So maybe the anticodon sequences in tRNA would have slight differences between species, but they still function the same way.

Looking at the options, let's go through them:

Option A: tRNA same, mRNA different. That makes sense because mRNA sequences would be different based on the genes, but tRNA's structure is more conserved.

Option B: tRNA slight variations, mRNA identical. No, mRNA isn't identical because the genes are different.

Option C: Both identical. Unlikely because mRNA would vary.

Option D: Both vary significantly. Maybe tRNA varies a little, but mRNA varies a lot, so D might not be right.

Option E: tRNA has different amino acids. Wait, tRNA doesn't carry different amino acids; all species use the same set. So E is probably wrong.

Option F: Similar function, tRNA differ in sequence; mRNA same sequence but different function. Hmm, mRNA sequences would differ, so F is incorrect.

Option G: tRNA different, mRNA same. No, because mRNA sequences are different.

Option H: tRNA completely different, mRNA similar. No, tRNA's are similar because of the universal code.

Option I: Both completely different. That's too strong; tRNA's structure is more conserved.

Option J: Anticodon regions different, rest same; mRNA identical. Wait, but mRNA isn't identical. So J is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me reconsider. The question is about whether the molecules are the same. For tRNA, the structure is more conserved because they need to recognize the same codons. But there might be minor variations in the anticodon regions. For mRNA, the actual sequences would be different because they come from different genes, but the overall structure (like having codons read the same way) is the same.

So looking back at the options, option A says tRNA are basically the same, mRNA are more different. That seems correct. But wait, the tRNA might have slight variations. So option A is correct.

Another angle: tRNA is more about the structure and function, which are conserved. The actual nucleotide sequences might have minor variations because different species might have slight differences in their tRNA genes, but they still recognize the same codons. So their tRNAs are similar but not identical. But mRNA sequences differ because each species has different genes. So the correct answer is probably A or J.

Wait, option J says the anticodon regions are different but the rest of tRNA is same, and mRNA is identical. But mRNA can't be identical because the genes are different. So J is wrong. So A is the better option. So in horse and human cells, tRNA is basically the same (but maybe with slight variations), while mRNA is much different.

Therefore, the answer should be A.
</think>

The transfer RNA (tRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules in horse and human cells are not entirely the same. tRNA molecules are involved in translating mRNA into proteins and have anticodon regions that recognize specific codons on mRNA. Due to the universal genetic code, the structure and function of tRNA are highly conserved across species, meaning tRNA molecules in horse and human cells are fundamentally similar. However, there may be slight variations in their nucleotide sequences, particularly in the anticodon regions, due to differences in tRNA gene sequences between species.

On the other hand, mRNA molecules carry the genetic information for protein synthesis and are transcribed from genes, which differ significantly between horse and human cells. As a result, the nucleotide sequences of mRNA molecules are much more different between the two species, even though the genetic code itself is the same.

Given this reasoning, the correct answer is:

**A: tRNA from cells of horse and man are basically the same, whereas the mRNA from the cells of these two animals would show much more difference.**
