Okay, so I need to figure out at what number of hours per year the total cost of both motors (Motor A and Motor B) will be the same. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the total cost of ownership for each motor includes the initial purchase price and the annual inspection and maintenance fee, plus the cost of the energy consumed by the motor. The goal is to find the number of hours where these total costs are equal.

Let me list out the given information:

- Motor A:
  - Cost: $169
  - Efficiency: 85.2%
- Motor B:
  - Cost: $149
  - Efficiency: 82.1%
  
Annual inspection and maintenance fee is 14.5% of the price for each motor. The energy cost is 2.35 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh), and 1 HP equals 0.746 kW.

I think I should calculate the total cost for each motor as a function of the number of hours they're used per year, then set them equal and solve for the hours.

Let's denote:
- T as the total cost
- h as the number of hours per year
- E as the energy cost
- M as the maintenance cost

For each motor, the total cost T would be the initial cost plus the maintenance cost plus the energy cost. Wait, no: the maintenance is an annual fee, so it's a fixed cost each year, regardless of the hours. The energy cost depends on the hours and efficiency.

So, the formula for total cost for each motor is:

T = (Initial Cost) + (Maintenance Cost) + (Energy Cost)

But wait, maintenance is 14.5% of the price each year. So for Motor A, maintenance is 14.5% of $169, and for Motor B, it's 14.5% of $149. These are fixed annual costs, so they don't depend on the number of hours.

The energy cost depends on how much power the motor uses. Since efficiency affects how much energy is consumed, a more efficient motor (higher efficiency) will use less energy for the same output.

Let me think about how to compute the energy consumed. The motor's power in kW is HP * 0.746. But since efficiency is given, the actual energy consumption (input power) is the output power divided by efficiency.

So, for each motor, when running for h hours, the energy consumed (in kWh) is:

Energy = (HP * 0.746) / Efficiency * h

Wait, because efficiency is output power divided by input power. So input power = output power / efficiency.

So, the energy consumed per hour is (HP * 0.746) / Efficiency_k. Then, over h hours, it's [HP * 0.746 / Efficiency_k] * h.

Then, the energy cost is energy (in kWh) multiplied by 0.00235 dollars per kWh.

So, putting it together, the total cost for each motor is:

T = (Initial Cost) + (Maintenance Cost) + (Energy Cost)

Where:
- Maintenance Cost = (Initial Cost) * 0.145
- Energy Cost = [ (HP * 0.746 / Efficiency) * h ] * 0.00235

Wait, but the initial cost is a one-time cost, right? Or is the maintenance fee an annual fee? Oh, wait, the problem says "annual inspection and maintenance fee". So the initial cost is a capital cost, but the maintenance fee is an annual recurring cost. Hmm, but the question is about the total cost being the same. So, I think we should consider all costs over the year, including the initial cost as a one-time cost, but the problem is asking for the number of hours where the total costs are equal. Wait, but the initial cost might be a sunk cost, but perhaps we are to consider the total cost per year, which would include the initial cost plus all other annual costs. Or maybe the problem is considering the initial cost as part of the annual cost? That seems unlikely because initial cost is a one-time payment, not an annual expense.

Wait, perhaps I should model the total cost per year as the sum of the initial cost, the annual maintenance fee, and the annual energy cost. But the initial cost is a one-time cost, so if we're looking at when the total costs over a year are equal, maybe the initial cost is considered a fixed cost for each motor, so it's included in the total cost for that year. So, for each motor, T = (Initial Cost) + (Maintenance Cost) + (Energy Cost).

But wait, I'm not sure if the initial cost is to be considered as part of the annual cost. Because the initial cost is paid upfront, whereas the maintenance and energy costs are ongoing. The question asks for the number of hours per year where the cost of both motors is the same. So perhaps the initial cost is part of the total cost for the year, meaning each motor's total cost is the sum of initial price, annual maintenance, and annual energy.

Alternatively, maybe the initial cost is a sunk cost and we're only considering the annual operating costs (maintenance + energy) plus the initial cost, but I'm not entirely sure. The problem states "the cost of both motors will be the same," so perhaps it's the total cost, including initial, maintenance, and energy.

Wait, perhaps the initial cost is part of the total cost, so the total cost per motor is:

T = (Initial Cost) + (Maintenance Cost) + (Energy Cost)

But wait, that would include the initial cost each year, which isn't correct because the initial cost is a one-time payment. So perhaps the problem is only considering the annual costs: maintenance plus energy. But that might not make sense because the initial cost is part of the total cost. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the total cost over the year, including the initial cost amortized over the year, but I think that's complicating it.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the total cost as the sum of the initial cost plus all the annual costs (maintenance and energy). So for each motor, the total cost is:

T = Initial Cost + (Maintenance Cost) + (Energy Cost)

So, let's proceed with that approach.

So, for Motor A:

T_A = 169 + (169 * 0.145) + [ (10 HP * 0.746 kW/HP) / 0.852 ) * h * 0.00235 ]

Similarly, for Motor B:

T_B = 149 + (149 * 0.145) + [ (10 HP * 0.746) / 0.821 ) * h * 0.00235 ]

Wait, no, because the motors are both 10 HP, so the first term in the energy calculation is 10 * 0.746 = 7.46 kW. So for each motor, the energy consumed per hour is 7.46 kW divided by their respective efficiencies.

So, let me compute each part step by step.

First, calculate the maintenance cost for each motor.

Motor A maintenance: 169 * 0.145

Let me compute that: 169 * 0.145.

Well, 169 * 0.1 = 16.9

169 * 0.04 = 6.76

169 * 0.005 = 0.845

Adding up: 16.9 + 6.76 = 23.66; 23.66 + 0.845 = 24.505. So approximately $24.505.

Similarly, Motor B maintenance: 149 * 0.145.

149 * 0.1 = 14.9

149 * 0.04 = 5.96

149 * 0.005 = 0.745

Adding up: 14.9 + 5.96 = 20.86; 20.86 + 0.745 = 21.605. So about $21.605.

Next, the energy cost per hour for each motor.

For Motor A: (7.46 kW) / 0.852 ≈ let's compute that.

7.46 / 0.852 ≈ let's see:

0.852 * 8 = 6.816 (since 0.852 * 8 = 6.816)

7.46 - 6.816 = 0.644

0.644 / 0.852 ≈ 0.756

So total is approximately 8.756 kW input power.

Wait, no, wait: 7.46 / 0.852.

Let me compute it accurately.

7.46 divided by 0.852.

Let me compute 7.46 / 0.852:

0.852 × 8 = 6.816

Subtract: 7.46 - 6.816 = 0.644.

Now, 0.644 / 0.852 ≈ 0.644 ÷ 0.852 ≈ 0.756.

So total is 8 + 0.756 ≈ 8.756 kW.

So, per hour, Motor A uses 8.756 kWh.

Wait, no, per hour, the motor runs at 10 HP, which is 7.46 kW output. The input power is 7.46 / 0.852 ≈ 8.756 kW. So per hour, it consumes 8.756 kWh.

So the energy cost per hour for Motor A is 8.756 kWh * 0.00235 $/kWh.

Let me compute that: 8.756 * 0.00235.

8 * 0.00235 = 0.0188

0.756 * 0.00235 ≈ 0.0017684

Adding: 0.0188 + 0.0017684 ≈ 0.0205684 dollars per hour.

So approximately $0.0205684 per hour.

Similarly, for Motor B, the input power is 7.46 / 0.821.

Compute 7.46 / 0.821.

Well, 0.821 × 9 = 7.389, which is close to 7.46.

7.46 - 7.389 = 0.071.

0.071 / 0.821 ≈ 0.0865.

So total is approximately 9.0865 kW.

So per hour, Motor B uses 9.0865 kWh.

Energy cost per hour: 9.0865 * 0.00235.

Compute that:

9 * 0.00235 = 0.02115

0.0865 * 0.00235 ≈ 0.000203

Total ≈ 0.02115 + 0.000203 ≈ 0.021353 dollars per hour.

So, approximately $0.021353 per hour.

Now, let's model the total cost for each motor as:

T_A = 169 + 24.505 + (0.0205684 * h)

T_B = 149 + 21.605 + (0.021353 * h)

We need to find h where T_A = T_B.

So set up the equation:

169 + 24.505 + 0.0205684 h = 149 + 21.605 + 0.021353 h

Simplify both sides.

Left side: 169 + 24.505 = 193.505, plus 0.0205684 h.

Right side: 149 + 21.605 = 170.605, plus 0.021353 h.

So the equation becomes:

193.505 + 0.0205684 h = 170.605 + 0.021353 h

Let me bring all terms to one side.

193.505 - 170.605 = 0.021353 h - 0.0205684 h

22.9 = 0.0007846 h

So h = 22.9 / 0.0007846 ≈ ?

Let me compute 22.9 ÷ 0.0007846.

Well, 0.0007846 is approximately 7.846e-4.

So 22.9 / 7.846e-4 ≈ ?

Let me compute 22.9 ÷ 0.0007846.

Dividing step by step:

0.0007846 × 29,200 = ?

Well, 0.0007846 * 29,200 = 29,200 * 7.846e-4 = 29,200 * 0.0007846 ≈ ?

Let's compute 29,200 * 0.0007846:

29,200 * 0.0007 = 20.44

29,200 * 0.0000846 = let's compute 29,200 * 0.00008 = 2.336, and 29,200 * 0.0000046 ≈ 0.13432.

So total ≈ 20.44 + 2.336 + 0.13432 ≈ 22.91.

So 0.0007846 * 29,200 ≈ 22.91, which is close to 22.9.

So h ≈ 29,200 hours? That can't be right because the options are in the hundreds.

Wait, that can't be. I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the equation setup.

Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, the energy cost per hour for Motor A is 8.756 kWh * 0.00235 $/kWh.

8.756 * 0.00235.

Let me compute 8 * 0.00235 = 0.0188.

0.756 * 0.00235 = ?

0.7 * 0.00235 = 0.001645

0.056 * 0.00235 ≈ 0.0001316

So total ≈ 0.001645 + 0.0001316 ≈ 0.0017766

So total energy cost per hour for Motor A: 0.0188 + 0.0017766 ≈ 0.0205766 $/h, which I approximated as 0.0205684. Close enough.

For Motor B, 9.0865 kWh * 0.00235.

9 * 0.00235 = 0.02115

0.0865 * 0.00235 ≈ 0.000203

Total ≈ 0.021353.

Now, the equation setup:

193.505 + 0.0205684 h = 170.605 + 0.021353 h

Subtract 170.605 from both sides: 22.9 + 0.0205684 h = 0.021353 h

Subtract 0.0205684 h from both sides: 22.9 = 0.0007846 h

So h = 22.9 / 0.0007846 ≈ ?

Wait, 0.0007846 is approximately 7.846e-4.

So 22.9 divided by 0.0007846 is approximately 22.9 / 0.0007846 ≈ 29,200 hours. That's way higher than the options given, which are all in the hundreds. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I included the initial cost in the annual total cost, which is incorrect. Because the initial cost is a one-time payment, not an annual cost. So perhaps the correct approach is to only consider the annual costs, not the initial cost, because the problem is asking for the cost per year where the total cost is the same. Or maybe the initial cost is considered part of the total cost, but we're looking for when the total cost (including initial) for both motors is the same. But getting over 29,000 hours suggests that the initial cost is making Motor A more expensive, but over time, the lower energy cost might offset it, but it's taking way too long.

Alternatively, maybe I should not include the initial cost because the problem is about the cost per year, not the total cost including initial purchase. Let me try that approach.

So, total annual cost would be:

Motor A: Maintenance + Energy

Motor B: Maintenance + Energy

So, let's recalculate without the initial costs.

Then, the equation becomes:

24.505 + 0.0205684 h = 21.605 + 0.021353 h

Subtract 21.605 from both sides: 2.9 + 0.0205684 h = 0.021353 h

Subtract 0.0205684 h from both sides: 2.9 = 0.0007846 h

h = 2.9 / 0.0007846 ≈ ?

Compute 2.9 / 0.0007846.

Well, 0.0007846 × 3,700 ≈ 2.9.

Because 0.0007846 * 3,700 = 2.899, which is very close to 2.9.

So h ≈ 3,700 hours. Again, this is way higher than the options given, which are in the hundreds. So something's wrong with my approach.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the energy cost per hour.

Wait, let me double-check the energy cost calculation.

For Motor A:

Efficiency is 85.2% or 0.852.

Output power is 10 HP * 0.746 kW/HP = 7.46 kW.

Input power = output / efficiency = 7.46 / 0.852 ≈ 8.756 kW.

Energy per hour: 8.756 kWh.

Energy cost per hour: 8.756 * 0.00235 = ?

Let me compute 8.756 * 0.00235:

Compute 8 * 0.00235 = 0.0188.

0.756 * 0.00235: Let's compute 0.7 * 0.00235 = 0.001645; 0.056 * 0.00235 ≈ 0.0001316. So total ≈ 0.001645 + 0.0001316 ≈ 0.0017766.

So total energy cost per hour ≈ 0.0188 + 0.0017766 ≈ 0.0205766, which is about $0.0205766/hour.

Similarly, for Motor B:

Efficiency 82.1% or 0.821.

Input power = 7.46 / 0.821 ≈ 9.0865 kW.

Energy cost per hour: 9.0865 * 0.00235.

Compute 9 * 0.00235 = 0.02115.

0.0865 * 0.00235 ≈ 0.000203.

Total ≈ 0.02115 + 0.000203 ≈ 0.021353 $/hour.

So those calculations seem correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should include the initial cost as a one-time cost but then calculate the total cost per year, including the initial cost, but that would require considering the initial cost as part of the annual cost, which might not be accurate because it's a one-time payment. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the operating costs (maintenance and energy) and not the initial cost, which would make the equation as I tried earlier without initial costs, but that gave h ≈ 3,700, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in including the initial cost. Let me think again.

The problem says "the cost of both motors will be the same." So perhaps it's the total cost, including initial cost, maintenance, and energy. So the initial cost is a one-time cost, but since we're looking for the number of hours per year where the total cost is the same, maybe we need to compute the total cost per year, including the initial cost, maintenance, and energy for each motor, and find when they are equal.

But that would require the initial cost to be part of the annual total cost, which isn't standard. Alternatively, perhaps the initial cost is considered as part of the total cost, and we're looking for when the total cost (including initial) is the same, but that would require some form of time value of money, which complicates things beyond the scope of the problem.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the total cost per year, including the initial cost as a one-time cost, but that's not how it's typically handled. So perhaps the problem is only considering the annual operating costs (maintenance and energy) and not the initial cost, which would make sense because the initial cost is a fixed investment, and the operating costs vary with usage.

So let's proceed under that assumption: the total cost to compare is the annual operating cost (maintenance + energy).

So, for Motor A: 24.505 + 0.0205766 h

For Motor B: 21.605 + 0.021353 h

Set them equal:

24.505 + 0.0205766 h = 21.605 + 0.021353 h

Subtract 21.605 from both sides: 2.900 + 0.0205766 h = 0.021353 h

Subtract 0.0205766 h from both sides: 2.900 = (0.021353 - 0.0205766) h

Which is: 2.900 = 0.0007764 h

So h = 2.900 / 0.0007764 ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

0.0007764 × 3,733 ≈ 2.900.

Because 0.0007764 * 3,733 ≈ 3,733 * 0.0007764 ≈ let's compute:

3,733 * 0.0007 = 2.6131

3,733 * 0.0000764 ≈ 3,733 * 0.00007 = 0.26131; 3,733 * 0.0000064 ≈ 0.0239

So total ≈ 0.26131 + 0.0239 ≈ 0.2852

Adding to 2.6131: 2.6131 + 0.2852 ≈ 2.8983, which is close to 2.9.

So h ≈ 3,733 hours. But the options are much lower, so I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in including the initial cost in the equation. Alternatively, perhaps I should model the total cost per year including the initial cost, but that would mean the initial cost is part of the total cost each year, which doesn't make sense because it's a one-time payment.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the total cost including the initial cost, but we're looking for when the total cost is the same, which would require the motors to be used for a certain number of years. But the problem states "per year," so it's probably looking for annual costs.

Wait, perhaps I should only include the initial cost once, and then the annual operating costs. So the total cost for each motor would be:

Motor A: 169 + (24.505 + 0.0205766 h) per year.

Similarly, Motor B: 149 + (21.605 + 0.021353 h) per year.

But since the initial cost is a one-time cost, perhaps the problem is asking when the sum of the initial cost plus annual costs for both motors are equal. But that would require knowing the number of years, which isn't provided. So perhaps the problem is only about the annual operating costs, excluding the initial cost.

Given that the options are in the hundreds, perhaps I should re-express the problem without including the initial cost. So the equation is:

24.505 + 0.0205766 h = 21.605 + 0.021353 h

Which simplifies to:

2.900 = 0.0007764 h → h ≈ 3,733 hours.

But this doesn't match any of the options, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the energy cost per hour. Let me recheck.

Wait, the energy cost per kWh is 2.35 cents, which is $0.00235 per kWh.

For Motor A:

Energy per hour = 8.756 kWh.

Energy cost per hour: 8.756 * 0.00235 = ?

Let me compute 8.756 * 0.00235.

8 * 0.00235 = 0.0188

0.756 * 0.00235:

0.7 * 0.00235 = 0.001645

0.05 * 0.00235 = 0.0001175

0.006 * 0.00235 = 0.0000141

Adding up: 0.001645 + 0.0001175 = 0.0017625; +0.0000141 = 0.0017766.

So total energy cost per hour: 0.0188 + 0.0017766 ≈ 0.0205766.

Similarly, Motor B:

Energy per hour: 9.0865 kWh.

Energy cost: 9.0865 * 0.00235.

9 * 0.00235 = 0.02115

0.0865 * 0.00235 ≈ 0.000203.

Total: 0.021353.

So that part is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering the annual cost without the initial cost, but then the hours are too high. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in units somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the cost per year, but considering that the motors are used for h hours, so the energy cost is (power * time) * cost per kWh.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the annual inspection and maintenance fee is a fixed cost per year, regardless of usage. So the total cost per year for each motor is:

Total Cost = Initial Cost + Maintenance Cost + (Energy Cost per kWh * (HP * 0.746 / Efficiency) * h)

But again, this includes the initial cost as a one-time cost, which might not be intended for comparison on an annual basis.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the initial cost, treating it as a sunk cost, and only consider the annual operating costs (maintenance and energy). So let's proceed with that.

So, Motor A's annual cost: 24.505 + 0.0205766 h

Motor B's annual cost: 21.605 + 0.021353 h

Set equal:

24.505 + 0.0205766 h = 21.605 + 0.021353 h

Subtract 21.605 from both sides: 2.900 + 0.0205766 h = 0.021353 h

Subtract 0.0205766 h: 2.900 = 0.0007764 h

h ≈ 2.900 / 0.0007764 ≈ 3,733 hours.

But this isn't matching any of the options, which suggests I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the initial cost as part of the annual cost, but amortizing it over the year. So, for example, treating the initial cost as part of the annual expense. So, for Motor A, the annual cost would be (169 + 24.505) + 0.0205766 h, and for Motor B, (149 + 21.605) + 0.021353 h.

But that would make the equation:

193.505 + 0.0205766 h = 170.605 + 0.021353 h

Which leads to h ≈ 22.9 / 0.0007846 ≈ 29,200 hours. Still way too high.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial cost isn't part of the annual cost, and the problem is only considering the operating costs (maintenance and energy). But then the hours are too high.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the energy cost per hour. Let me recheck.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the energy cost is calculated per kilowatt-hour, so the cost per hour is (input power in kW) * 0.00235 dollars.

So for Motor A, input power is 8.756 kW, so per hour, energy cost is 8.756 * 0.00235 = $0.0205766.

Similarly, for Motor B, it's 9.0865 * 0.00235 = $0.021353.

So, the annual energy cost for h hours is 0.0205766 * h for A and 0.021353 * h for B.

So, including maintenance, the annual cost for A is 24.505 + 0.0205766 h, and for B, 21.605 + 0.021353 h.

Set equal: 24.505 + 0.0205766 h = 21.605 + 0.021353 h

Subtract 21.605 from both sides: 2.900 + 0.0205766 h = 0.021353 h

Subtract 0.0205766 h: 2.900 = (0.021353 - 0.0205766) h → 0.0007764 h

h ≈ 2.900 / 0.0007764 ≈ 3,733 hours.

This still doesn't match any options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the energy cost. Let me check again.

Wait, 1 HP = 0.746 kW, so 10 HP = 7.46 kW output.

Efficiency is output / input → input = output / efficiency.

So for Motor A: input = 7.46 / 0.852 ≈ 8.756 kW.

Energy per hour: 8.756 kWh.

Energy cost per hour: 8.756 * 0.00235 = ?

Let me compute 8.756 * 0.00235:

8 * 0.00235 = 0.0188

0.756 * 0.00235:

0.7 * 0.00235 = 0.001645

0.056 * 0.00235 = 0.0001316

Total: 0.001645 + 0.0001316 = 0.0017766

So total energy cost per hour: 0.0188 + 0.0017766 ≈ 0.0205766.

Same as before.

For Motor B: 7.46 / 0.821 ≈ 9.0865 kW input.

Energy cost: 9.0865 * 0.00235 ≈ 0.021353.

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should try to compute the break-even point without including the initial cost, but then the hours are too high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the total cost including initial cost, but without annualizing it. So, perhaps the initial cost plus one year's operating costs (maintenance and energy) are equal for both motors. Let's try that.

So, for Motor A:

Total cost = 169 + 24.505 + 0.0205766 h

For Motor B:

Total cost = 149 + 21.605 + 0.021353 h

Set equal:

169 + 24.505 + 0.0205766 h = 149 + 21.605 + 0.021353 h

Combine terms:

193.505 + 0.0205766 h = 170.605 + 0.021353 h

Subtract 170.605: 22.9 + 0.0205766 h = 0.021353 h

Subtract 0.0205766 h: 22.9 = 0.0007764 h

h ≈ 22.9 / 0.0007764 ≈ 29,200 hours. Again, not matching options.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try a different approach, perhaps setting up the equations correctly.

Let me define the variables again.

Let me denote:

For each motor, the total cost per year is the sum of:

- Initial cost (C)
- Annual maintenance (M = C * 0.145)
- Annual energy cost (E = (HP * 0.746 / Efficiency) * h * 0.00235)

So, for Motor A:

C_A = 169

M_A = 169 * 0.145 = 24.505

E_A = (10 * 0.746 / 0.852) * h * 0.00235 = (7.46 / 0.852) * 0.00235 * h ≈ 8.756 * 0.00235 * h ≈ 0.0205766 * h

So, T_A = 169 + 24.505 + 0.0205766 h

Similarly, for Motor B:

C_B = 149

M_B = 149 * 0.145 = 21.605

E_B = (10 * 0.746 / 0.821) * h * 0.00235 ≈ 9.0865 * 0.00235 * h ≈ 0.021353 * h

So, T_B = 149 + 21.605 + 0.021353 h

We set T_A = T_B:

169 + 24.505 + 0.0205766 h = 149 + 21.605 + 0.021353 h

Simplify:

193.505 + 0.0205766 h = 170.605 + 0.021353 h

Subtract 170.605:

22.9 + 0.0205766 h = 0.021353 h

Subtract 0.0205766 h:

22.9 = (0.021353 - 0.0205766) h = 0.0007764 h

h = 22.9 / 0.0007764 ≈ 29,200 hours.

This is way beyond the options given, which are in the hundreds. So perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the initial cost, treating it as a sunk cost, and only compare the annual operating costs (maintenance + energy). Let's try that.

So, T_A = 24.505 + 0.0205766 h

T_B = 21.605 + 0.021353 h

Set equal:

24.505 + 0.0205766 h = 21.605 + 0.021353 h

Subtract 21.605:

2.900 + 0.0205766 h = 0.021353 h

Subtract 0.0205766 h:

2.900 = 0.0007764 h

h ≈ 2.900 / 0.0007764 ≈ 3,733 hours.

Still not matching the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the energy cost per hour. Let me check again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the full-load efficiency to calculate the energy consumption, but perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the annual energy consumption in kWh and then multiply by the cost per kWh.

So, for Motor A, annual energy consumption is (7.46 kW / 0.852) * h hours.

So, kWh per year: (7.46 / 0.852) * h.

Similarly for Motor B: (7.46 / 0.821) * h.

Then, annual energy cost is kWh * 0.00235.

So, for Motor A: (7.46 / 0.852) * h * 0.00235

For Motor B: (7.46 / 0.821) * h * 0.00235

But including maintenance and initial cost.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the annual operating costs (maintenance and energy), not the initial cost. So, let's proceed with that.

So, the equation is:

24.505 + (7.46 / 0.852) * h * 0.00235 = 21.605 + (7.46 / 0.821) * h * 0.00235

Let me compute the coefficients:

For Motor A:

(7.46 / 0.852) * 0.00235 ≈ 8.756 * 0.00235 ≈ 0.0205766

For Motor B:

(7.46 / 0.821) * 0.00235 ≈ 9.0865 * 0.00235 ≈ 0.021353

So, the equation is:

24.505 + 0.0205766 h = 21.605 + 0.021353 h

Which brings us back to the same equation, leading to h ≈ 3,733 hours. Not matching options.

I'm clearly missing something here. Let me try to compute the break-even point without considering the initial cost, perhaps the problem expects that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the energy cost and maintenance cost, not the initial cost. So, the equation is:

Maintenance + Energy cost for A = Maintenance + Energy cost for B

24.505 + (7.46 / 0.852) * h * 0.00235 = 21.605 + (7.46 / 0.821) * h * 0.00235

Which simplifies to:

24.505 + 0.0205766 h = 21.605 + 0.021353 h

Which again gives h ≈ 3,733 hours.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the initial cost to be ignored, and only the cost per kWh and maintenance are considered, but I'm not seeing how that would lead to the given options.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the units for the energy cost. Let me check again.

Electric energy costs 2.35 cents per kWh, which is $0.00235 per kWh. So, yes, that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the number of hours where the total cost (including initial cost) is the same when considering the cost per year. So, perhaps the initial cost is considered as an annual cost, which would be incorrect, but let's try.

So, for Motor A:

Total annual cost = (169 + 24.505) + 0.0205766 h = 193.505 + 0.0205766 h

For Motor B:

Total annual cost = (149 + 21.605) + 0.021353 h = 170.605 + 0.021353 h

Set equal:

193.505 + 0.0205766 h = 170.605 + 0.021353 h

Which gives h ≈ 29,200 hours. Still doesn't match.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try plugging in the options to see which one makes the total costs equal.

Let's try option J: 374 2/3 hours ≈ 374.6667 hours.

Compute T_A and T_B for h = 374.6667.

First, for Motor A:

Maintenance: 24.505

Energy: 0.0205766 * 374.6667 ≈ 0.0205766 * 374.6667 ≈ let's compute:

0.02 * 374.6667 ≈ 7.4933

0.0005766 * 374.6667 ≈ 0.2168

Total ≈ 7.4933 + 0.2168 ≈ 7.7101

So T_A ≈ 24.505 + 7.7101 ≈ 32.2151

For Motor B:

Maintenance: 21.605

Energy: 0.021353 * 374.6667 ≈ 0.021353 * 374.6667 ≈

0.02 * 374.6667 ≈ 7.4933

0.001353 * 374.6667 ≈ 0.5074

Total ≈ 7.4933 + 0.5074 ≈ 7.9997 ≈ 8.00

So T_B ≈ 21.605 + 8.00 ≈ 29.605

Not equal. So option J isn't the answer.

Try option H: 500 hours.

T_A: 24.505 + 0.0205766 *500 ≈ 24.505 + 10.2883 ≈ 34.7933

T_B: 21.605 + 0.021353 *500 ≈ 21.605 +10.6765 ≈32.2815

Not equal.

Option C: 600 hours.

T_A: 24.505 + 0.0205766 *600 ≈24.505 +12.34596≈36.85096

T_B:21.605 +0.021353*600≈21.605+12.8118≈34.4168

Still not equal.

Option G:350 hours.

T_A:24.505 +0.0205766*350≈24.505 +7.2018≈31.7068

T_B:21.605 +0.021353*350≈21.605 +7.47355≈29.07855

Not equal.

Option I:425 hours.

T_A:24.505 +0.0205766*425≈24.505 +8.739≈33.244

T_B:21.605 +0.021353*425≈21.605 +9.070≈30.675

Not equal.

Option F:275.5 hours.

T_A:24.505 +0.0205766*275.5≈24.505 +5.683≈30.188

T_B:21.605 +0.021353*275.5≈21.605 +5.880≈27.485

Not equal.

Option D:300 hours.

T_A:24.505 +0.0205766*300≈24.505 +6.173≈30.678

T_B:21.605 +0.021353*300≈21.605 +6.4059≈28.0109

Not equal.

Option E:325 1/3 hours ≈325.333.

T_A:24.505 +0.0205766*325.333≈24.505 +6.698≈31.203

T_B:21.605 +0.021353*325.333≈21.605 +6.955≈28.56

Still not equal.

Option A:450 hours.

T_A:24.505 +0.0205766*450≈24.505 +9.259≈33.764

T_B:21.605 +0.021353*450≈21.605 +9.608≈31.213

Not equal.

Option B:400 hours.

T_A:24.505 +0.0205766*400≈24.505 +8.2306≈32.7356

T_B:21.605 +0.021353*400≈21.605 +8.5412≈30.1462

Not equal.

Hmm, none of the options give equal total costs when only considering maintenance and energy. So perhaps I'm missing the initial cost in the equation, but then the hours are way too high.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in including the initial cost. Let me try including the initial cost but without annualizing it, i.e., considering the initial cost as a one-time cost and then the annual costs. So, the equation would be:

169 + 24.505 + 0.0205766 h = 149 + 21.605 + 0.021353 h

Which simplifies to:

193.505 + 0.0205766 h = 170.605 + 0.021353 h

Then, 22.9 = 0.0007764 h → h ≈ 29,200 hours.

But this isn't an option, so perhaps the problem expects the initial cost to be ignored, and only the operating costs are considered. But then, as per earlier calculations, the hours are too high.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Let me try to compute the break-even point where the total cost (including initial) is the same.

So, T_A = 169 + 24.505 + 0.0205766 h

T_B = 149 + 21.605 + 0.021353 h

Set equal:

169 + 24.505 + 0.0205766 h = 149 + 21.605 + 0.021353 h

Which gives:

193.505 + 0.0205766 h = 170.605 + 0.021353 h

Subtract 170.605:

22.9 + 0.0205766 h = 0.021353 h

Subtract 0.0205766 h:

22.9 = 0.0007764 h → h ≈29,200 hours.

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the initial cost is part of the annual cost, but amortized over the year. So, for example, the initial cost is treated as an annual expense, which would be incorrect but let's try.

So, for Motor A: (169 + 24.505) + 0.0205766 h

For Motor B: (149 + 21.605) + 0.021353 h

Set equal:

193.505 + 0.0205766 h = 170.605 + 0.021353 h

Which again gives h ≈29,200 hours.

I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the energy cost. Let me try to compute the energy cost per hour correctly.

For Motor A:

Energy consumed per hour (input power) = 10 HP * 0.746 kW/HP / 0.852 = 7.46 / 0.852 ≈8.756 kW.

Energy cost per hour: 8.756 * 0.00235 = ?

Compute 8 * 0.00235 = 0.0188

0.756 * 0.00235:

0.7 * 0.00235 = 0.001645

0.056 * 0.00235 ≈0.0001316

Total ≈0.001645 + 0.0001316 ≈0.0017766

So total energy cost per hour: 0.0188 + 0.0017766 ≈0.0205766.

Similarly, for Motor B:

Input power = 7.46 / 0.821 ≈9.0865 kW.

Energy cost: 9.0865 * 0.00235 ≈0.021353.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the full-load current or something else, but I don't think so.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is using the motor's efficiency to calculate the energy consumption differently. For example, perhaps it's using the formula:

Energy cost = (HP * 0.746 / (Efficiency * 100)) * h * 0.00235

Wait, no, because efficiency is already a decimal (85.2% is 0.852), so that approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the motors are used for h hours, so the energy consumed is (HP * 0.746 / Efficiency) * h kWh.

So, the cost is (HP * 0.746 / Efficiency) * h * 0.00235.

Which is what I've been using.

I think I've tried everything, but I can't get the hours to match the options. Perhaps the correct answer is option J: 374 2/3 hours, but when I tried it earlier, the totals weren't equal. Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, let me try option J again: 374 2/3 hours ≈374.6667.

Compute T_A:

Maintenance:24.505

Energy:0.0205766 *374.6667≈0.0205766 *375≈7.716225

Total T_A≈24.505 +7.716225≈32.2212

T_B:

Maintenance:21.605

Energy:0.021353 *374.6667≈0.021353 *375≈8.007075

Total T_B≈21.605 +8.007075≈29.612075

Not equal.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but since the options are provided, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should set up the equation without the initial cost but include the initial cost as part of the annual cost.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the initial cost as part of the annual cost, but that would require knowing how many years the motor is used, which isn't given. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the energy cost and maintenance, ignoring the initial cost.

In that case, the equation is:

24.505 + 0.0205766 h =21.605 + 0.021353 h

Which gives h≈3,733 hours, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the energy cost per hour. Let me compute it again.

For Motor A:

Energy per hour: 8.756 kWh.

Energy cost:8.756 *0.00235=?

Let me compute 8 *0.00235=0.0188

0.756 *0.00235=0.0017766

Total:0.0205766.

Yes, correct.

For Motor B:

9.0865 *0.00235=?

9 *0.00235=0.02115

0.0865 *0.00235≈0.000203

Total:0.021353.

Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different formula, such as considering the initial cost as part of the annual cost, but I can't see how that would work.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the cost per kWh as 2.35 cents without converting to dollars. Wait, that's possible. Let me check.

If the energy cost is 2.35 cents per kWh, that's $0.0235 per kWh, not $0.00235. Did I make a mistake here?

Oh no! That's a big mistake. I thought it was $0.00235, but 2.35 cents is $0.0235 per kWh.

That changes everything. Let me recalculate with this correction.

So, the energy cost per kWh is $0.0235.

So, for Motor A:

Energy cost per hour:8.756 * 0.0235 ≈ ?

Compute 8 * 0.0235 = 0.188

0.756 * 0.0235 ≈0.017766

Total ≈0.188 +0.017766 ≈0.205766 $/h

Similarly, for Motor B:

Energy cost per hour:9.0865 *0.0235 ≈?

9 *0.0235=0.2115

0.0865 *0.0235≈0.00203

Total≈0.2115 +0.00203≈0.21353 $/h

Now, let's recalculate the equation with this correction.

So, for Motor A:

Maintenance:24.505

Energy cost:0.205766 h

Total T_A=24.505 +0.205766 h

For Motor B:

Maintenance:21.605

Energy cost:0.21353 h

Total T_B=21.605 +0.21353 h

Set equal:

24.505 +0.205766 h=21.605 +0.21353 h

Subtract 21.605 from both sides:

2.900 +0.205766 h=0.21353 h

Subtract 0.205766 h:

2.900=0.21353 h -0.205766 h=0.007764 h

h=2.900 /0.007764≈373.3 hours.

Which is approximately 373.3 hours, which is close to option J:374 2/3 hours (≈374.6667).

So, the correct answer is option J.
</think>

To determine the number of hours per year where the total cost of both motors is the same, we analyze the total cost for each motor, which includes the annual maintenance fee and the energy cost. The initial cost is not included in the annual cost comparison.

### Motor A:
- **Cost**: $169  
- **Efficiency**: 85.2% (0.852)  
- **Annual Maintenance**: $169 × 14.5% = $24.505  
- **Energy Cost**:  
  - Output power: 10 HP × 0.746 kW/HP = 7.46 kW  
  - Input power: 7.46 kW / 0.852 ≈ 8.756 kW  
  - Energy cost per hour: 8.756 kWh × $0.0235/kWh ≈ $0.205766  
  - Total energy cost for *h* hours: $0.205766 × *h*  

Total cost for Motor A:  
\[ T_A = 24.505 + 0.205766h \]

### Motor B:
- **Cost**: $149  
- **Efficiency**: 82.1% (0.821)  
- **Annual Maintenance**: $149 × 14.5% = $21.605  
- **Energy Cost**:  
  - Output power: 10 HP × 0.746 kW/HP = 7.46 kW  
  - Input power: 7.46 kW / 0.821 ≈ 9.0865 kW  
  - Energy cost per hour: 9.0865 kWh × $0.0235/kWh ≈ $0.21353  
  - Total energy cost for *h* hours: $0.21353 × *h*  

Total cost for Motor B:  
\[ T_B = 21.605 + 0.21353h \]

### Setting Total Costs Equal:
\[ 24.505 + 0.205766h = 21.605 + 0.21353h \]

Subtracting \( 21.605 \) from both sides:  
\[ 2.900 + 0.205766h = 0.21353h \]

Subtracting \( 0.205766h \) from both sides:  
\[ 2.900 = 0.007764h \]

Solving for *h*:  
\[ h = \frac{2.900}{0.007764} \approx 373.3 \, \text{hours} \]

This value is closest to **Option J: 374 \( \frac{2}{3} \) hours**.

**Answer:**  
J
