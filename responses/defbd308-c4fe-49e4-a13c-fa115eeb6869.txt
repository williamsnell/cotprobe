Okay, so I have this question about how many bits are required on average to describe the decay time of a radium atom with 3-digit accuracy. The half-life is given as 80 years, and I'm supposed to figure out the number of bits needed. The options are A to J, with numbers ranging from 10 to 50, mostly in increments of 5 or so.

First, I think about what the question is asking. It's about information theory, specifically the number of bits needed to describe something with a certain precision. The decay time is the time until the atom decays, and the half-life is the median, which means half of the atoms will decay before 80 years, and half after.

So, I remember that for a half-life, the decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability density function for an exponential distribution is f(t) = λ e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. The half-life T_1/2 is related to λ by T_1/2 = ln(2)/λ. So λ = ln(2)/T_1/2. Given T_1/2 is 80 years, λ = 0.00875 per year.

But wait, the question is about the bits needed to describe the decay time with 3-digit accuracy. That means I need to find the range of possible times and then determine how many bits are needed to represent a value within that range to three decimal places or something like that.

Wait, 3-digit accuracy. Hmm. So, perhaps it's about the number of significant digits or the precision. If I need to describe the time with three digits, like in years, maybe it's about the number of significant figures or the range of possible values.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the entropy, the information content required to specify the decay time with a certain precision. I think that relates to the logarithm of the number of possible values.

So, let's think about the possible decay times. The half-life is 80 years, so the median is 80, meaning half the atoms decay before 80 and half after. But the decay time can be any positive real number. So the possible times range from 0 to infinity. But to describe it with 3-digit accuracy, perhaps that means we're considering intervals of 0.1 years, so each digit represents a tenth of a year.

Wait, no, 3-digit accuracy might mean three significant digits, but more likely, it refers to the number of bits required to represent the value with that precision. So, the question is about how many bits are needed on average to represent the decay time with three-digit accuracy.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the entropy. The entropy H of a distribution gives the average information content needed to describe a value from that distribution. So, H would be the average number of bits needed.

I recall that for an exponential distribution, the entropy is H = ln(2) + 1/(ln(2)). But wait, wait, let me think. The entropy for an exponential distribution with rate λ is H = 1 + ln(λ)/ln(2). Or perhaps that's not quite right. Let me get the exact formula.

The entropy H of an exponential distribution with parameter λ is given by H = 1 - ln(λ) / ln(2). Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me double-check. The entropy is H = ln(λ) + Γ(1) where Γ is the gamma function, but wait, no. For exponential distribution, the entropy is H = 1 + ln(λ). But wait, actually, I think the formula is H = 1 + ln(λ) when considering the natural logarithm, but since we need bits, which is base 2, we have to convert it.

Wait, let me think again. The entropy in nats (natural logs) is H_nat = 1 - ln(λ). To convert to bits, H = H_nat / ln(2). So H = (1 - ln(λ)) / ln(2).

Wait, no, I think I might have gotten that wrong. Let me make sure. The exponential distribution's entropy is H = 1 + ln(λ), but that's using the rate parameter λ where λ is the mean. Wait, no: the mean of exponential is 1/λ, right? So if the half-life is 80 years, then the mean is 80 years. So λ = 1/80 per year.

Wait, no, wait. The half-life T_1/2 is related to λ by T_1/2 = ln(2)/λ. So λ = ln(2)/T_1/2. So with T_1/2=80, λ= ln(2)/80 ≈ 0.00875 per year.

So the entropy in nats is H_nat = 1 - ln(λ). So H_nat = 1 - ln(ln(2)/80).

Wait, let's compute that. ln(λ) is ln(0.00875). Let me compute that. ln(0.00875) = ln(1/114.2857) ≈ -4.736. So H_nat = 1 - (-4.736) = 5.736 nats.

To convert to bits, divide by ln(2). So H ≈ 5.736 / 0.693 ≈ 8.28 bits.

But the question is about 3-digit accuracy. Hmm. How does that tie in? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It says, "roughly how many bits are required on the average to describe to 3 digit accuracy the decay time (in years)".

Wait, perhaps it's not about the entropy directly but about the number of bits needed to represent the time with 3 digits. So, if we're specifying the time t with 3 digits, like t = abc.def, where a, b, c are the integer part and d, e, f are the decimal digits, then the number of possible values is 10^3 = 1000. So the number of bits needed is log2(1000) ≈ 9.966 bits, roughly 10 bits. So the answer would be around 10 bits.

But wait, the options don't have 10 as the correct answer except for option C (10). But wait, I'm not sure if that's the right approach because the decay time isn't uniformly distributed. It's exponentially distributed, so the number of possible values isn't uniform. The exponential distribution has a higher probability of decaying early and lower probability of decaying later. So, the number of bits required isn't just based on the number of possible values, but perhaps on the information content considering the distribution.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of bits needed to represent the decay time with 3 significant figures, which would require more bits than just 10. Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, another approach: The decay time T has a median of 80 years. The half-life is 80, so the median is 80. So, the average time is also 80 years because the mean of an exponential distribution is 1/λ, which is 80. So, to describe T with 3-digit accuracy, perhaps we need to represent it with enough precision to capture variations around the mean.

But maybe the question is simpler. It's asking for the number of bits required on average to describe T with 3-digit accuracy. So, perhaps each digit adds a certain number of bits. For example, each decimal digit can be represented with log2(10) ≈ 3.3219 bits. So, 3 digits would be about 10 bits, which is option C.

But wait, the options include 28, 16, etc. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding what "3-digit accuracy" means. Maybe it's about the number of significant digits, which could be more involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the precision in terms of the number of years. For example, if the decay time can be any real number, but we're only interested in the integer number of years, then 3 digits would mean 1000 possibilities. But that's not right because 3 digits can represent up to 999, but the actual decay time is a real number.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of bits needed to represent the time with three significant digits. So, for example, if the time is 80 years, three significant digits would be 800, 80, or 8. But that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the number of bits needed to represent the time T with a relative error of 1% (which would be 3 significant figures). So for T around 80 years, 1% is 0.8 years. So the absolute error is about 0.8 years. So the number of bits needed would be the number of bits required to represent the time with that precision.

Alternatively, think about the range. The decay time T can be any positive real number. To describe T with 3-digit accuracy, perhaps we're considering intervals of 0.1 years (i.e., 10^-1). So each possible time is within an interval of 0.1 years. The number of such intervals from 0 to, say, 1000 years would be 10000 intervals (since 1000 / 0.1 = 10000). But the exponential distribution's tail extends to infinity, but practically, most of the probability is within a few half-lives. For example, after 80*5=400 years, the probability is very low.

But to get 3-digit accuracy, perhaps we're considering that the time is known to the nearest 0.1 years. So the number of possible values is 10^3 = 1000? Wait, no, 0.1 years is one decimal place, so 3 digits after the decimal would be 0.001 years. Hmm, but that's getting more precise.

Alternatively, if we're considering 3 significant digits, the number of possibilities would depend on the scale. For example, for a number around 80, 3 significant digits would be 800 (1 sig fig), 80 (2), or 80.0 (3). But that's probably not the right approach.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The number of bits required to represent a number with a certain precision is related to the logarithm of the number of possible values. So, if we can represent T with N possible values, then the number of bits needed is log2(N). So the question is, how many possible values do we need to represent T with 3-digit accuracy?

If 3-digit accuracy means we're considering intervals of 0.1 years (one decimal place), then each interval is 0.1 years wide. So the number of intervals up to some maximum time T_max is T_max / 0.1. But since T can be any positive real, T_max would be very large, but in practice, the probability beyond a certain point is negligible.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model it as the number of possible values within the range where the probability is significant. For example, most of the probability mass of an exponential distribution lies within a few standard deviations. For an exponential distribution with λ=1/80, the standard deviation is also 80 years. So, within 4 standard deviations, T would be up to 320 years. So the range from 0 to 320 years.

If we're considering 3-digit accuracy, perhaps each 0.1 year is a separate value. So the number of values is 320 / 0.1 = 3200. So the number of bits needed is log2(3200) ≈ 11.6 bits, which is around 12 bits. But the options don't have 12, so perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Wait, but I'm getting confused between the number of possible values and the actual information content. Maybe the correct approach is to calculate the entropy of the distribution, which would give the average number of bits needed.

Earlier, I tried calculating the entropy of the exponential distribution. Let me try that again.

The entropy H of an exponential distribution with rate λ is given by:

H = 1 + ln(λ)  (in nats)

But wait, I think I'm mixing up the formula. Let me double-check. The entropy of an exponential distribution is H = 1 + (1/λ) * (1/λ) ? No, that's not right. Wait, no. The entropy is H = 1 + ln(λ), but I'm not sure. Let me recall the formula.

The entropy H for an exponential distribution with parameter λ (where λ is the rate, so mean is 1/λ) is H = 1 + ln(λ). So with λ = ln(2)/80 ≈ 0.00875, H_nat = 1 + ln(0.00875). Let me compute that.

ln(0.00875) is ln(1/114.2857) ≈ -4.736. So H_nat = 1 - 4.736 ≈ -3.736 nats. Wait, that can't be right because entropy can't be negative. I must have the formula wrong.

Wait, I think the correct formula is H_nat = 1 + ln(λ). But wait, that would mean H_nat = 1 + (-4.736) = -3.736, which is negative, which is impossible. So I must have messed up the formula.

Let me look it up in my mind. The entropy of an exponential distribution is H = 1 + ln(λ). But λ is the rate, which is 1/mean. So mean is 80, so λ = 1/80 ≈ 0.0125 (Wait, no, wait. Earlier, I thought λ was ln(2)/80 ≈ 0.00875. Hmm, perhaps I confused the parameters.)

Wait, the half-life T_1/2 is related to λ by T_1/2 = ln(2)/λ. So λ = ln(2)/T_1/2 = (0.6931)/80 ≈ 0.008664 per year.

Alternatively, the mean of the distribution is μ = 1/λ. So μ = 80 years, which fits with the half-life being 80 years (they are the same for an exponential distribution? Wait, no, the mean and the half-life are different. Wait, no, for an exponential distribution, the half-life is T_1/2 = ln(2)/λ, and the mean is μ = 1/λ. So T_1/2 = ln(2) * μ. So for μ=80, T_1/2=80 * 0.693 ≈ 55.4 years. But the given half-life is 80 years, so that suggests that the mean is longer. So perhaps I'm confusing the parameters.

Wait, maybe the problem states that the half-life is 80 years, so T_1/2=80. Then, λ = ln(2)/80 ≈ 0.00875 per year.

Then, the mean μ = 1/λ ≈ 114.2857 years.

So, the entropy H_nat = 1 + ln(λ). So H_nat = 1 + ln(0.00875) ≈ 1 -4.736 ≈ -3.736. But that's negative, which can't be right. So I must be using the wrong formula.

Wait, another approach: The entropy H of an exponential distribution is given by H = 1 + ln(μ), where μ is the mean. So μ=80, so H_nat=1 + ln(80) ≈ 1 + 4.382 ≈ 5.382 nats.

Wait, that makes more sense. So, H_nat=5.382 nats. To convert to bits, H=H_nat / ln(2) ≈5.382 / 0.6931≈7.76 bits.

But the question is about 3-digit accuracy, so perhaps we need to adjust for that. Or maybe the question is simply asking for the entropy, which would be around 7.76 bits, which is approximately 8 bits. But the options don't have 8. The closest option is F:16, which is double, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It says "to describe to 3 digit accuracy the decay time (in years)". So perhaps, instead of the entropy, which is the average information content, the question is about the number of bits needed to specify the time with three significant digits, which would require more bits.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about quantizing the decay time into intervals and then finding the number of bits per interval. For 3-digit accuracy, perhaps each interval is 0.1 years, so 10^3 intervals up to 1000 years. But the number of possible intervals would be 10000 (from 0 to 1000, step 0.1). So log2(10000) ≈13.28 bits. But that's not an option either.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the number of bits needed to represent the time with 3 significant figures. For a number around 80, three significant figures would be 800, which is 3 digits. But how does that translate to bits? Each digit is about 3.32 bits, so 3 digits would be about 10 bits, which is option C.

But earlier, I thought the entropy was around 8 bits, which isn't an option, but option C is 10, which is close.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of bits needed to represent the time with 3 significant figures, which would require knowing the time to that precision. So, if the time is known to three significant figures, how many bits does that take? For example, 80.0 years would be three significant figures. The number of possible values with three significant figures up to, say, 1000 years would be 1000 - 100 +1 = 901? Not sure.

Wait, another approach: The number of bits needed to represent a number with N possible values is log2(N). So if we can represent the time with 3-digit accuracy, that means we can distinguish between 1000 different values (like 0.000, 0.001, ..., 999.999). But that's for 3 decimal places. Alternatively, for 3 significant figures, the number of possible values depends on the magnitude.

But perhaps the question is simpler. It's asking for the average number of bits needed to describe the time with 3-digit accuracy. If each digit is represented with log2(10) ≈3.32 bits, then 3 digits would be about 10 bits, which is option C:10.

But wait, the options don't include 10 as the correct answer because the correct approach might be different. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of bits required to encode the time with 3 significant figures, considering the distribution. Since the distribution is exponential, the number of bits isn't uniform. The times are more likely to be shorter, so the number of bits needed might be less than if it were uniform.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of bits required to represent the time with 3 significant figures, which would be about 10 bits as I thought earlier.

But looking at the options, option E is 28, which is about 2^28 possibilities, which is a huge number. That seems too high.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different angle. The question is about 3-digit accuracy, which might mean that the time is known to the nearest 100 years. So, for example, 80 years could be represented as 80, which is two digits. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, 3-digit accuracy could mean that the time is known to the nearest 10 years, so 80 would be 80, which is two digits. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, 3-digit accuracy could mean that the time is known to three decimal places, i.e., 0.001 years. So the number of possible values would be 10^3 = 1000. So the number of bits needed is log2(1000) ≈9.966, which rounds to 10 bits, option C.

But earlier, I thought the entropy was around 8 bits, which would be less than 10. So maybe the answer is 10 bits, option C.

Wait, but another way: the number of bits needed to represent a value with a certain precision is the number of bits required to specify the interval it falls into. So, if the decay time T is between 0 and infinity, but we're only considering intervals of 0.1 years, the number of intervals is infinite, which isn't practical.

But perhaps considering the significant probability, most of the decay times are within a certain range. For example, after 3 half-lives, which is 240 years, the probability is about 0.05, so 5%. So, for practical purposes, we can consider the range up to 240 years.

If we're using intervals of 0.1 years, the number of intervals up to 240 years is 240 / 0.1 = 2400. So the number of bits needed is log2(2400) ≈11.23 bits, which is about 11 bits. But again, the options don't include 11.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the range but about the number of significant digits. So, if we need to describe the time with 3 significant digits, the number of bits needed would be based on the number of possible significant figures. For example, for numbers between 0.001 and 999, the number of significant digits varies, but for numbers around 80, three significant digits would require 2^3.32 ≈ 10 bits.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: the question says "on average". So perhaps it's about the average number of bits needed to describe T with three digits, which would involve the distribution.

Alternatively, considering that the half-life is 80 years, and the decay time is exponentially distributed, the average time is 80 years. To describe the decay time with three digits, perhaps we're considering that the time can be any real number, but we need to represent it with enough bits to capture the necessary precision.

Wait, maybe the problem is simpler. The question is about how many bits are required on average to describe the decay time to 3-digit accuracy. So, perhaps it's about the number of bits needed to represent a number with three significant figures, which is typically around 10 bits (since 10 bits can represent 1024 different values, which is more than enough for three significant figures).

But looking at the options, option C is 10, which would fit. However, I recall that the entropy of the exponential distribution with mean 80 is around 7.76 bits, which is less than 10. So perhaps the answer is around 10 bits, which is option C:10.

But wait, another thought: the question might be about the number of bits needed to represent the time with a precision of three significant figures, which would require more bits than just the entropy. Because entropy gives the average information content without considering the specific representation.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the number of bits needed to represent the time with 3 significant figures, which is log2(1000) ≈10 bits, so option C.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: the number of bits needed to represent a number x with k significant figures is approximately log2(10^k) = k * log2(10) ≈ k * 3.32. So for k=3, it's about 10 bits. So option C.

But looking back, the options are A:50, B:35, C:10, D:40, E:28, F:16, G:24, H:45, I:19, J:30.

So, if the answer is 10, then option C is correct.
</think>

To determine the number of bits required on average to describe the decay time of a radium atom with 3-digit accuracy, we consider the exponential distribution of decay times with a half-life of 80 years. The half-life being the median implies the mean decay time is also 80 years. 

The question focuses on 3-digit accuracy, which could mean specifying the time with three significant figures or to the nearest 0.1 years. To represent a number with three significant figures, we calculate the number of bits needed as follows:

1. **Significant Figures and Bits**: Each significant figure can be represented with approximately 3.32 bits (since \( \log_2(10) \approx 3.32 \)). For three significant figures, the total number of bits required is \( 3 \times 3.32 = 10 \) bits.

2. **Options Analysis**: Among the given options, 10 bits corresponds to option C. Other options, like 28 or 16 bits, would be excessive for describing three significant figures.

Thus, the average number of bits needed to describe the decay time with 3-digit accuracy is **10 bits**.

**Answer: C**
