Okay, let's try to figure out which of these options is correct regarding money and financial markets. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll go through each option step by step.

Starting with option A: "As the demand for bonds increases, the interest rate increases." Hmm, wait. I remember that bonds and interest rates are inversely related. When more people demand bonds, the price of bonds goes up because there's more buying. But since bonds' price is inversely related to their yield (which is the interest rate), if the price goes up, the yield (interest rate) goes down. So if demand increases, interest rates should decrease, making option A incorrect.

Moving on to option B: "For a given money supply, if nominal GDP increases, the velocity of money decreases." Velocity of money is GDP divided by the money supply (V = GDP/M). If GDP increases and money supply stays the same, velocity would actually increase, not decrease. So option B is wrong.

Option C: "When demand for stocks and bonds increases, the asset demand for money falls." That sounds plausible. Asset demand for money is the desire to hold money as an asset. If people prefer holding stocks or bonds more, they might hold less cash, thus reducing the demand for money. So this seems correct.

Option D: "A macroeconomic recession increases the demand for loanable funds." During a recession, businesses might invest less, so the demand for loanable funds (like savings or loans) could decrease because they don't need as much investment. Alternatively, maybe individuals save more during a recession, increasing the supply of loanable funds. So I think D is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be option C.

The correct answer is C.

When the demand for stocks and bonds increases, the asset demand for money decreases because people prefer holding other financial assets over cash.

Answer: C
