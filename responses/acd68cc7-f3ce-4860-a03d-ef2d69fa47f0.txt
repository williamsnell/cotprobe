Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which option would not be proper proof for a voluntary manslaughter charge. I remember that voluntary manslaughter typically involves intentional killing without malice, usually due to adequate provocation or acting in the heat of passion. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: The defendant acted without deliberation and premeditation. That sounds correct because voluntary manslaughter doesn't require premeditation. It's more about acting in the heat of the moment, so this is a proper element.

Option B: The defendant acted in self-defense. Wait, self-defense is usually a separate defense, like justification. But I think self-defense might not fall under voluntary manslaughter. If someone kills in self-defense, it's not considered manslaughter; it's more like an acquittal. So maybe B is not proper for voluntary manslaughter.

Option C: The defendant was provoked by accidentally seeing his wife having sex with his best friend. That's a classic example of adequate provocation, leading to heat of passion. So this is proper.

Option D: The defendant was provoked by his wife's refusal to prepare his favorite meal. Hmm, is refusing to cook a meal considered adequate provocation? I think adequate provocation needs to be something serious, like an assault or adultery. Refusing a meal seems too trivial, so D might not be proper.

Option E: The defendant acted in an overpowering heat of passion. That's exactly what voluntary manslaughter is about, so E is proper.

Option F: The defendant acted several days after the provoking events. Wait, if the provocation happened several days before, the heat of passion would have cooled down. So the killing wouldn't be in the immediate heat of passion. Therefore, F would not be proper proof because the time gap likely invalidates the heat of passion defense.

Option G: The defendant was provoked by a minor disagreement with his wife. Similar to D, a minor argument might not be considered adequate provocation. So G could be improper.

Option H: The defendant acted while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. I think voluntary intoxication isn't a defense, but if it leads to adequate provocation, maybe? Or perhaps it's not relevant. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Some jurisdictions might say that voluntary intoxication doesn't negate premeditation but might affect the heat of passion. Not sure if H is proper or not.

So, looking back, the question is which one would NOT be proper. The options that seem incorrect are B, D, F, G, and maybe H.

Wait, self-defense (B) is a separate defense, not part of voluntary manslaughter. So B is not proper for a manslaughter charge. Also, D and G involve minor provocations that aren't sufficient. F is about the timing, which would mean no heat of passion.

So the question is which one is NOT proper. The options are asking which one would not support the charge. So all except A, C, E are possibly incorrect.

But the question is which one would NOT be proper. So looking at the options, the answer is likely D, F, G, or B.

Wait, let me think again. For voluntary manslaughter, the provocation must be such that a reasonable person would have been unable to control themselves. Accidentally seeing a spouse cheating is a classic example, so C is correct.

Self-defense (B) is a separate issue. If the defendant killed in self-defense, it's not manslaughter; it's more like a justification. So B wouldn't be proper for voluntary manslaughter.

Option D: refusal to prepare a meal. That's too minor, so D is not proper.

Option F: several days after. Heat of passion must be immediate, so F is invalid.

Option G: minor disagreement. Also too minor, so G is invalid.

So the question is which one is the incorrect proof. The options are multiple, but the question asks which one would not be proper.

Wait, the question is which is not proper. So which one cannot be used to support voluntary manslaughter.

I think B (self-defense) is a separate defense. So B is not proper for voluntary manslaughter. Similarly, D, F, G are also not proper. But the question asks for which would not be proper, so all except A, C, E are wrong.

But the options are given as A through H, and the question is which is the incorrect proof.

Wait, the correct elements for voluntary manslaughter are:

1. The killing was intentional.
2. There was adequate provocation (sufficient to cause a reasonable person to act in passion).
3. The killing occurred in a heat of passion.
4. The defendant didn't have time to cool off.

So looking at the options:

A: No deliberation or premeditation. Correct, as voluntary manslaughter doesn't require malice or premeditation.

B: Self-defense. Not applicable to voluntary manslaughter; it's a separate defense.

C: Provoked by seeing wife with friend. Adequate provocation. Correct.

D: Refuse meal. Not adequate. Incorrect.

E: Overpowering heat of passion. Correct.

F: Several days later. Cooling off period; so no heat of passion. Incorrect.

G: Minor disagreement. Not adequate provocation. Incorrect.

H: Under influence of alcohol or drugs. If voluntary intoxication, it's not a defense, but if it leads to provocation, maybe. I'm not sure, but perhaps H is not relevant because intoxication alone doesn't create heat of passion unless it's involuntary.

So the question is which one would NOT be proper. The options that are not proper are B, D, F, G.

The question is which one is the answer. The options are A to H, and the choices are in a list.

But the question is which one would not be proper. So all except A, C, E are incorrect. The question is asking for the option that is not proper, so which of the following would not be proper.

Looking back at the options, the correct answers are B, D, F, G. But the options are listed as options, and I have to pick one.

Wait, the question says which would not be proper. So the incorrect proofs are B, D, F, G. So the options that are correct for voluntary manslaughter are A, C, E.

So the options that are not proper are B, D, F, G, H.

But the answer choices are A to H, so the question is which one is not proper. So for example, option D: refusal to prepare meal is too trivial, so it's not proper. Similarly, B is not proper.

The question is which one would not be proper. So among the options, which one is invalid.

I think the intended answer is D, because refusing a meal is not adequate provocation. Alternatively, B is self-defense, which is a separate defense.

Wait, but the question is about proving voluntary manslaughter. So if the defense is using self-defense, that's not voluntary manslaughter; it's a different justification. So B is not proper for voluntary manslaughter.

Similarly, D is not proper because it's not adequate provocation.

But the question is which one would not be proper. So perhaps the answer is D or B.

Looking at the model penal code, adequate provocation includes serious assault, reasonable belief of imminent serious bodily injury, etc. Seeing a spouse cheat is considered adequate. But refusing a meal is not.

So the answers that would not be proper are B, D, F, G, H.

But the options are from A to H, so the question is which is the correct answer.

Wait, the question is asking which would not be proper proof. So the options that are not proper are B, D, F, G, and possibly H.

But the options are:

A: Correct.

B: Not proper.

C: Correct.

D: Not proper.

E: Correct.

F: Not proper.

G: Not proper.

H: Not sure, but likely not proper.

So the question is which of the following would not be proper. So all except A, C, E are incorrect.

But the question is which one is the answer.

Wait, the answer options are A through J, but in the given question, it's up to H.

Wait, the possible answers are A to J, but the options are A to H.

Wait, the question says, the answer is one letter, A to J, but the options are A to H.

So the correct answer is likely D, because refusing a meal is not adequate provocation.

Alternatively, B is self-defense, which is a separate defense, so it's not part of voluntary manslaughter.

But the question is about which would not be proper to establish voluntary manslaughter. So if the defense is using self-defense, that's not voluntary manslaughter. So B is not proper.

Alternatively, the answer is D because it's not a sufficient provocation.

I think the intended answer is D, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, F is incorrect because the heat of passion must be immediate.

Wait, let me think again. For heat of passion, the provoking event and the killing must be so close in time that there was no cooling-off period. So if it's several days later, as in F, the heat of passion has passed, so F is not proper.

So options B, D, F, G, H are not proper.

But the question is which one is the answer. The options are:

A: Correct.

B: Incorrect.

C: Correct.

D: Incorrect.

E: Correct.

F: Incorrect.

G: Incorrect.

H: Maybe incorrect.

So the choices for the answer are B, D, F, G, H.

The question is which one would not be proper. So the answer is probably D, because it's a trivial provocation.

Alternatively, F is also incorrect.

But the question is among the options, which one is not proper.

I think the intended answer is D: the defendant was provoked by his wife's refusal to prepare his favorite meal. Because that's an insufficient provocation.

The question asks which option would not be proper proof to establish a voluntary manslaughter charge. Voluntary manslaughter typically involves intentional killing without malice, usually due to adequate provocation or acting in the heat of passion. Let’s analyze each option:

- **A**: The defendant acted without deliberation and premeditation. This is correct because voluntary manslaughter does not require premeditation.
- **B**: The defendant acted in self-defense. Self-defense is a separate defense and not part of voluntary manslaughter, making this incorrect for the charge.
- **C**: The defendant was provoked by accidentally seeing his wife having sexual relations with his best friend. This is a classic example of adequate provocation, so it is correct.
- **D**: The defendant was provoked by his wife's refusal to prepare his favorite meal. This is too trivial to constitute adequate provocation, making it incorrect.
- **E**: The defendant acted in an overpowering heat of passion. This aligns with the definition of voluntary manslaughter, so it is correct.
- **F**: The defendant acted several days after the provoking events. The heat of passion must be immediate, so this is incorrect.
- **G**: The defendant was provoked by a minor disagreement with his wife. This is also too minor to be considered adequate provocation, making it incorrect.
- **H**: The defendant acted while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Voluntary intoxication generally does not negate premeditation or establish heat of passion, so this is likely incorrect.

Among the options, **D** stands out as the most clearly incorrect because refusing to prepare a meal is not a sufficient provocation for voluntary manslaughter.

**Answer: D**
