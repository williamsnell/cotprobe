Options:

A: 82
B: 91
C: 71
D: The score that was the mode of the five scores
E: The score that made the average 75
F: 80
G: A score not listed among the five provided scores
H: The score that was the median of the five scores
I: 76
J: The score that made the average 79

Alright, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, Mrs. Walter has five math scores: 71, 76, 80, 82, and 91. She's entering them into a spreadsheet one by one in random order, and after each entry, the class average is an integer. We need to find out which score was entered last.

First, I know that the average being an integer after each entry means that the sum of the scores entered up to that point must be divisible by the number of scores entered so far. So, let's break it down.

There are five scores, so the process goes like this:

1. After the first score: sum1 must be divisible by 1 (which it always is, so no issue).
2. After the second score: sum2 must be divisible by 2.
3. After the third score: sum3 must be divisible by 3.
4. After the fourth score: sum4 must be divisible by 4.
5. After the fifth score: sum5 must be divisible by 5.

But wait, the fifth score is the total sum, which is fixed. Let me calculate the total sum first. Adding all the scores: 71 + 76 is 147, plus 80 is 227, plus 82 is 309, plus 91 is 400. So the total sum is 400, which is divisible by 5 (since 400/5=80), so that's good.

Now, let's think about the possible sums after each step. Let's denote the entered scores as s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, where s5 is the last one.

We know that sum1 = s1 is any of the scores, but since it's just one number, it's trivially an integer average.

Sum2 = s1 + s2 must be divisible by 2. So s1 + s2 is even. That means s1 and s2 must be both even or both odd.

Looking at the scores: 71 (odd), 76 (even), 80 (even), 82 (even), 91 (odd). So, the odd scores are 71 and 91, and the evens are 76, 80, 82.

So, for sum2 to be even, s1 and s2 must be both odd or both even.

Similarly, sum3 must be divisible by 3. So sum3 = s1 + s2 + s3 must be a multiple of 3.

Sum4 must be divisible by 4, and sum5 is 400, which we've already established.

Let me think about the possible orderings. The key is to find the order where each partial sum is divisible by the number of terms.

Let's consider the possible last numbers. Since the last number is s5, which is part of all sums from sum5 backwards.

Wait, perhaps another approach: Let's consider the possible last numbers and see if the conditions hold.

But maybe a better way is to consider the possible remainders when each number is added step by step.

Another approach is to note that the sum after four numbers (sum4) must be divisible by 4, and the fifth number is 400 - sum4, which must be one of the remaining numbers.

Wait, but the fifth number is s5, which is the last one. So, sum4 must be divisible by 4, and sum4 + s5 = 400, so s5 = 400 - sum4.

But sum4 is divisible by 4, so s5 must be congruent to 400 mod 4, which is 0, because 400 is 4*100. So s5 must be congruent to 0 mod 4? Wait, no. Because sum4 is divisible by 4, so sum4 ≡ 0 mod4, and 400 ≡ 0 mod4, so s5 = 400 - sum4 ≡ 0 - 0 ≡ 0 mod4. Therefore, s5 must be divisible by 4.

Looking at the scores: 71, 76, 80, 82, 91.

Which of these are divisible by 4?

71 ÷4=17.75 → no.

76 ÷4=19 → yes.

80 ÷4=20 → yes.

82 ÷4=20.5 → no.

91 ÷4=22.75 → no.

So s5 must be either 76 or 80.

Wait, but let's check: 76 is 4×19, 80 is 4×20, so yes, both are divisible by 4.

So the last number must be either 76 or 80.

Wait, but let's check the options. The options are A:82, B:91, C:71, D:mode (which is none, since all are unique), E: the score that made the average 75. Let's see what that would be. If average is 75 after some entries, sum would be 75×n. But let's not get into that yet.

Looking back, the last number must be 76 or 80.

So possible last scores are 76 or 80.

Now, let's see if that's possible.

Let me try to see the possible sequences.

Alternatively, perhaps the last number is 76 or 80, but let's see if both are possible.

Alternatively, maybe only one of them works.

Let me try to see what sum4 would be if s5 is 76.

If s5=76, then sum4 = 400 -76=324.

324 must be divisible by 4. 324 ÷4=81, which is 81, so yes, 324 is divisible by 4.

So sum4=324, which is 4×81.

Similarly, if s5=80, sum4=400-80=320. 320 ÷4=80, which is an integer, so that's also possible.

So both 76 and 80 could be the last numbers.

Wait, but we need more constraints.

Let me think about the earlier sums.

Let's consider sum3.

sum3 must be divisible by 3.

sum3 = sum of first three scores.

Similarly, sum2 must be divisible by 2, sum1 is any.

So perhaps we can model this by considering the possible sequences where each step meets the divisibility condition.

Alternatively, perhaps we can look at the possible remainders when each score is considered modulo the number of terms.

But that might get complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can look for the possible orderings.

Wait, let me try to think about the possible last numbers again.

If the last number is 76, then sum4=324. So the first four numbers must add up to 324.

The sum of all five numbers is 400, so the first four would be 400-76=324.

Now, let's see what the possible first four numbers could be.

The numbers would be 71,80,82,91,76, but since 76 is last, the first four are 71,80,82,91.

Wait, no, no: the five numbers are 71,76,80,82,91. If the last is 76, the first four are 71,80,82,91.

Let's check if their sum is 324.

71+80=151, +82=233, +91=324. Yes, that's correct.

So sum4=324, which is 4×81, so average after four entries is 81, which is an integer.

Now, let's check if the sum after three entries (sum3) is divisible by 3.

So, the first three numbers must add up to a multiple of 3.

Let's consider the possible combinations of three numbers from 71,80,82,91.

Wait, but the first four are 71,80,82,91, in some order, and the first three must sum to a multiple of 3.

Let me compute the sum of 71,80,82,91: 71+80=151, +82=233, +91=324. So sum4 is 324.

Now, the sum3 must be a multiple of 3, and sum3 is part of sum4.

So, sum3 must be a divisor of 324, but sum3 is sum of first three, which are a subset of 71,80,82,91.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the possible sum3.

Let me compute the sum of each possible triplet from 71,80,82,91.

Possible triplets:

71,80,82: sum=71+80+82=233. 233 ÷3 is 77.666... Not integer.

71,80,91: sum=71+80+91=242. 242 ÷3≈80.666... Not integer.

71,82,91: sum=71+82+91=244. 244 ÷3≈81.333... Not integer.

80,82,91: sum=80+82+91=253. 253 ÷3≈84.333... Not integer.

Hmm, none of the triplets from 71,80,82,91 add up to a multiple of 3.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the first three numbers are a subset of these four, but none of their sums are divisible by 3, then the sequence ending with 76 as the last number cannot have the first three numbers sum to a multiple of 3. Therefore, 76 cannot be the last number because it would make sum3 impossible.

Wait, that's a problem. So if s5=76, then the first four numbers are 71,80,82,91, and their triplets don't sum to a multiple of 3, which is required for sum3.

Therefore, 76 cannot be the last number because it would make sum3 impossible.

So, that means the last number must be 80.

Let me check that.

If s5=80, then sum4=400-80=320.

So, the first four numbers are 71,76,82,91.

Wait, no: the five numbers are 71,76,80,82,91. If s5=80, then the first four are 71,76,82,91.

Let me check if these four numbers can be arranged such that their sums after each step are divisible by 1,2,3,4 respectively.

First, the sum of the first four numbers is 71+76+82+91= 71+76=147, +82=229, +91=320, which is correct.

Now, sum3 must be a multiple of 3.

Let me check the sum of any three of these four numbers: 71,76,82,91.

Possible triplets:

71,76,82: 71+76=147 +82=229. 229 ÷3 ≈76.333... Not integer.

71,76,91: 71+76=147 +91=238. 238 ÷3≈79.333... Not integer.

71,82,91: 71+82=153 +91=244. 244 ÷3≈81.333... Not integer.

76,82,91: 76+82=158 +91=249. 249 ÷3=83. Exactly.

So the triplet 76,82,91 sums to 249, which is divisible by 3.

So, if the first three numbers are 76,82,91 in some order, their sum is 249, which is 3×83.

Then, the fourth number would be 71, making sum4=249+71=320, which is 4×80, so that's good.

But wait, the order matters. Let me see.

Wait, the first three numbers could be 76,82,91, but in any order. Then, the fourth number is 71, making sum4=320.

But wait, after four numbers, the sum is 320, which is 4×80, so average 80.

Then, the fifth number is 80, making the total sum 400.

But let's check the earlier steps.

After first number: any of the first three (76,82,91) would be entered. The sum is that number, which is fine.

After second number: sum2 must be even.

So, let's say the first two numbers are 76 and 82.

Sum2=76+82=158, which is even, so average is 79, integer.

Then, third number is 91. Sum3=158+91=249, which is divisible by 3, as we saw.

Then, fourth number is 71. Sum4=249+71=320, which is divisible by 4.

Then, fifth number is 80. Sum5=400, average 80.

This works.

Alternatively, the first three numbers could be 76,82,91 in any order. Let's check another permutation.

First number: 82, second:76, third:91.

Sum1=82, sum2=82+76=158, sum3=158+91=249.

Same as before.

Another permutation: first number 91, second 76, third 82.

Sum1=91, sum2=91+76=167, which is odd. Wait, 167 is odd, so sum2=167 is not divisible by 2. That's a problem.

So, that permutation wouldn't work because sum2 would be 167, which is not even.

So, the order matters. So, to have sum2 even, the first two numbers must be both even or both odd.

In the case where the first three numbers are 76,82,91, let's see:

If the first two are 76 and 82, both even, sum2=158, which is even.

If the first two are 76 and 91, sum=76+91=167, which is odd. Not allowed.

If the first two are 82 and 91, sum=82+91=173, which is odd. Not allowed.

So, the only way the first two numbers can be both even is if they are 76 and 82. Therefore, the first two numbers must be 76 and 82 in some order.

Then, the third number is 91, making sum3=249.

Then, the fourth number is 71, making sum4=320.

Finally, the fifth number is 80.

So, the order would be something like 76,82,91,71,80.

Alternatively, 82,76,91,71,80.

But in both cases, the last number is 80.

Wait, but let me check another possibility where the first three numbers include 71.

Wait, no, because if the last number is 80, the first four numbers are 71,76,82,91.

So the first three must be a subset of these four, but we've already determined that the only triplet that works is 76,82,91, which sums to 249.

So, in that case, the first three are 76,82,91, then the fourth is 71, making sum4=320.

Thus, the last number is 80.

Alternatively, let's check if the last number could be 76. Earlier, we saw that the first three numbers would have to be 71,80,82,91, but none of their triplets sum to a multiple of 3, which is required for sum3.

Therefore, 76 cannot be the last number because it would make sum3 impossible.

Therefore, the last number must be 80.

Wait, but let me double-check.

If the last number is 80, then the first four are 71,76,82,91.

We found that sum4=320, which is 4×80.

And sum3=249, which is 3×83.

So, the sequence could be 76,82,91,71,80.

Let's check each step:

1. Enter 76: sum=76, average=76 → integer.
2. Enter 82: sum=76+82=158, average=79 → integer.
3. Enter 91: sum=158+91=249, average=83 → integer.
4. Enter 71: sum=249+71=320, average=80 → integer.
5. Enter 80: sum=400, average=80 → integer.

Yes, that works.

Alternatively, another order:

1. 82,76,91,71,80.

1. 82 → avg=82
2. 82+76=158 → avg=79
3. 158+91=249 → avg=83
4. 249+71=320 → avg=80
5. 320+80=400 → avg=80

Same result.

But what if the first two numbers are 71 and 76?

Wait, no, because in the case where the last number is 80, the first four are 71,76,82,91.

Wait, but in that case, the first two numbers could be 71 and 76. Let's see:

1. 71 → avg=71
2. 71+76=147 → avg=73.5 → not integer. So that's invalid.

So, the first two numbers cannot be 71 and 76 because their sum is 147, which is not even. So, the first two must be both even, which in this case would be 76 and 82.

So, the first two must be 76 and 82 in some order.

Therefore, the last number must be 80.

Looking back at the options, option F is 80.
</think>

The last score Mrs. Walter entered was 80, as it satisfies all the conditions for the averages to be integers at each step.

Answer: F
