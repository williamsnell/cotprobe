Question:

This question refers to the following information.
For a long time, educated Germans answered it in the positive, initially by laying claim to a special German mission, then, after the collapse of 1945, by criticizing Germany's deviation from the West. Today, the negative view is predominant. Germany did not, according to the now prevailing opinion, differ from the great European nations to an extent that would justify speaking of a "unique German path." And, in any case, no country on earth ever took what can be described as the "normal path."

Okay, so I have this question about a passage from a book by Heinrich August Winkler. The question is about inferring the belief that Germany had a unique mission in history based on the passage. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, reading the passage carefully: It says that educated Germans used to answer in the positive about Germany having a unique mission. Initially, they thought of a special German mission. But after 1945, when Germany collapsed, they started criticizing Germany's deviation from the West. Now, the negative view is predominant. So today, the prevailing opinion is that Germany didn't differ enough to justify a "unique German path." Also, no country on earth took the "normal path."

So the passage is talking about a shift in beliefs over time. Initially, people thought Germany had a unique mission, but after 1945, especially post-WWII, this view changed.

The question is about what happened to the belief that Germany had a unique mission. The options are A to I.

Looking at the options:

A: supported by other European nations after WWII.

Hmm, the passage doesn't mention other European nations supporting this belief; it's more about the internal German perspective shifting.

B: reinforced by Germany's economic recovery after WWII.

The passage talks about a shift in views after 1945, but I'm not sure if the economic recovery (like the Wirtschaftswunder) directly reinforces the belief in a unique mission. The passage says that after WWII, they started criticizing their deviation from the West, so maybe the economic recovery was part of integrating into the West, which might have led to the decline of the unique mission belief.

C: proven correct by Germany's defeat in WWII.

Well, the defeat in WWII is mentioned, but the passage says that after the collapse of 1945, the belief was criticized. So I don't think the defeat proved the belief correct; it probably discredited it.

D: resulted from Germany's defeat in WWII.

Wait, the passage says that before 1945, they had the belief. Then after 1945, they criticized it. So the defeat might have led to this change in perspective. So maybe D is a contender.

E: was the prevailing view in Germany after WWII.

No, the passage says that the negative view is predominant now, implying that after WWII, the belief was no longer the main view.

F: was rejected by all Germans after WWII.

No, it says the negative view is predominant, but not necessarily all Germans. Some might still hold it, but it's not the prevailing opinion.

G: was discredited by Germany's defeat in WWII.

Yes, because after WWII, the belief was criticized and the negative view became predominant. So the defeat discredited the unique mission belief.

H: was unaffected by Germany's defeat in WWII.

No, because the passage says that after the collapse (defeat), the view changed.

I: led to Germany's victory in WWII.

No, that doesn't make sense; the defeat is the opposite.

So between options D and G. D says the belief resulted from the defeat, but the passage says that the belief existed before the defeat. The defeat caused the belief to be criticized, leading to it being discredited.

So the correct inference is that the belief was discredited by the defeat, which is option G.
</think>

The passage discusses how the belief in Germany's unique historical mission shifted over time. Initially supported, it was later criticized after World War II, leading to a predominant negative view. Among the options, G correctly states that this belief was discredited by Germany's defeat in World War II.

Answer: G
