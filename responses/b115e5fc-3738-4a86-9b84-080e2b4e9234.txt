Okay, so I have this marketing research question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about marketing research, and there are five options given. I need to pick the correct one. Let me read each option carefully.

Option A: "Is the process of presenting a product to the market without any prior research." Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Marketing research is about gathering information before making decisions, not presenting a product without research. So probably not A.

Option B: "Involves only understanding the structural characteristics of the industry of concern without any other factors." Wait, marketing research is broader than just industry structures. It also looks at market trends, customer behavior, competition, etc. So B might be too narrow.

Option C: "Is work undertaken to understand how to make specific marketing strategy decisions." That sounds familiar. Marketing research is indeed conducted to help make strategic decisions. It provides insights to support those decisions, so C seems correct. But I'll check the others to be sure.

Option D: "Is only concerned with the social research ignoring market and opinion research." No, that's backwards. Marketing research includes both social and market research. It's not ignoring either. So D is incorrect.

Option E: "Involves solely collecting data without any form of analysis." No, marketing research isn't just about collecting data. Analysis is a key part. So E is wrong.

Option F: "Is the process of deciding the marketing strategy without considering any external data." That doesn't make sense. Marketing research uses external data to inform strategies, so F is incorrect.

Option G: "Is only concerned with the opinion research ignoring market and social research." Again, no. Marketing research includes various types like market, opinion, and social research. So G is wrong.

So, going through all the options, C seems to be the correct one because it directly ties marketing research to making specific marketing strategy decisions, which aligns with what I know about the field.
