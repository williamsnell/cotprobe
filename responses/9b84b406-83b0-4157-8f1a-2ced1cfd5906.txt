Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about simple harmonic motion, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem says that one end of a fingernail file is clamped in a vise, and the other end is vibrated to and fro. The free end's motion is approximately simple harmonic motion (SHM). The frequency is given as 10 vibrations per second, and the amplitude is 4 millimeters. The question is asking for the velocity when the displacement of the free end is 2 millimeters.

Hmm, I remember that in SHM, the velocity isn't constant; it changes depending on where the object is in its oscillation. At maximum displacement (amplitude), the velocity is zero because it's the turning point. At the equilibrium position (where displacement is zero), the velocity is maximum. So in this case, when the displacement is 2 mm, which is halfway to the amplitude, the velocity should be somewhere between zero and maximum.

I think the formula for velocity in SHM is v = Aω√(1 - (x/A)²), where:
- v is the velocity,
- A is the amplitude,
- ω is the angular frequency,
- x is the displacement from the mean position.

Wait, another version I recall is v = ω√(A² - x²). Oh right, because A is the amplitude, and x is the current displacement. So that's the same as the first formula because √(1 - (x/A)^2) is the same as √( (A² - x²)/A² ), which when multiplied by A gives √(A² - x²).

So, let's note down the given values:
- Frequency (f) = 10 Hz (since 10 vibrations per second is 10 Hz).
- Amplitude (A) = 4 mm = 4 × 10^-3 meters, but since all units are in mm, maybe I can keep everything in mm to avoid confusion.
- Displacement (x) = 2 mm.

First, I need to find the angular frequency ω. I know that ω = 2πf. So plugging in f=10 Hz, ω = 2 * π *10 ≈ 62.83 rad/s.

Wait, but since I'm working in mm for displacement and amplitude, maybe I should convert ω into mm-related terms? Hmm, but velocity will be in mm/s, so perhaps I can proceed without converting to meters.

Wait, no, because the formula uses ω, which is in radians per second, and that's a unit that's independent of length units. So maybe it's better to compute everything in mm.

Wait, let me check: SHM velocity formula is v = ω√(A² - x²). Let me plug the values in.

So A is 4 mm, x is 2 mm.

Calculating A² - x²: (4)^2 - (2)^2 = 16 -4 =12 mm².

Then the square root of 12 mm² is sqrt(12) mm ≈ 3.464 mm.

So v = ω * 3.464 mm.

But wait, angular frequency ω is 2πf = 2 * π *10 = 20π rad/s ≈ 62.83 rad/s.

So plugging in ω:

v = 62.83 rad/s * 3.464 mm.

Wait, but wait a second. The units here are rad/s multiplied by mm. Because ω is in rad/s, and the sqrt part is mm, so the units for v would be (rad/s * mm) → mm/s, since radians are dimensionless. So that makes sense.

So let's calculate that:

62.83 * 3.464 ≈ ?

Let me compute 62.83 * 3.464.

First, 62.83 * 3 = 188.49.

62.83 * 0.464: Let's compute 62.83 * 0.4 = 25.132, 62.83 * 0.064 ≈ 4.03632. Adding those gives 25.132 + 4.03632 ≈ 29.16832.

So total is 188.49 + 29.16832 ≈ 217.65832 mm/s.

Looking at the options, option J is 218 mm/s, which is very close to this value.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute 62.83 * 3.464.

Wait, 3.464 is approximately 2√3, which is about 3.464101615.

So 62.83 * 3.464 ≈ 62.83 * 3.464.

Let me compute this more accurately:

62.83 * 3 = 188.49.

62.83 * 0.464:

Compute 62.83 * 0.4 = 25.132.

62.83 * 0.06 = 3.7698.

62.83 * 0.004 = 0.25132.

Adding these: 25.132 + 3.7698 = 28.9018 + 0.25132 ≈ 29.15312.

So total is 188.49 + 29.15312 ≈ 217.64312 mm/s.

Rounded to three decimal places, that's approximately 217.643 mm/s. The nearest option is J: 218 mm/s.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps I should express everything in meters and seconds to ensure unit consistency. Let me try that approach.

Amplitude A = 4 mm = 0.004 m.

Displacement x = 2 mm = 0.002 m.

Angular frequency ω = 2πf = 2 * π *10 ≈62.83 rad/s.

Then velocity v = ω * sqrt(A² - x²) = 62.83 * sqrt( (0.004)^2 - (0.002)^2 )

Calculating inside the sqrt:

(0.004)^2 = 0.000016 m².

(0.002)^2 = 0.000004 m².

So A² - x² = 0.000016 - 0.000004 = 0.000012 m².

sqrt(0.000012) = sqrt(1.2e-5) = approximately 0.003464 m.

Then v = 62.83 * 0.003464 ≈ ?

Calculating that: 62.83 * 0.003464.

Let me compute 62.83 * 0.003 = 0.18849.

62.83 * 0.000464 ≈ 62.83 * 0.0004 = 0.025132, plus 62.83 * 0.000064 ≈ 0.00403632. So total is approx 0.025132 + 0.00403632 ≈ 0.02916832.

Adding to 0.18849: 0.18849 + 0.02916832 ≈ 0.21765832 m/s.

Convert that to mm/s: 0.21765832 m/s = 217.65832 mm/s, which again rounds to 218 mm/s.

So that's the same as before. So the correct answer should be option J: 218 mm/s.

The velocity of the free end when the displacement is 2 mm is calculated using the SHM velocity formula, resulting in approximately 218 mm/s.
