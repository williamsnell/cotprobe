Okay, so I've got this heat transfer problem here. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. 

The problem states that a fluid is flowing in a circular pipe with radius R. Heat is being transferred from the walls to the fluid at a constant rate q_w per unit area. I need to derive an expression for the temperature distribution and the local heat transfer coefficient h_x. The flow is laminar and fully developed, and axial conduction is negligible compared to radial conduction. Also, at x=0, the bulk mean temperature T_b1 is known. 

Hmm, right. So, I remember that in heat transfer, when dealing with laminar flow in a pipe, especially circular, the temperature distribution can be found using the theory of heat conduction and convective heat transfer.

Wait, the flow is fully developed and laminar. That probably means that the velocity profile is fully developed, so the velocity doesn't change along the pipe's length. But since it's circular, the velocity varies with the radius.

The heat is being transferred from the walls to the fluid, so the fluid is absorbing heat. The heat transfer is at a constant rate q_w per unit area. I think q_w would be the heat flux at the wall, which is the heat per unit area per unit time.

Axial conduction is negligible, so heat transfer is primarily radial. So, I can probably assume steady-state, one-dimensional heat transfer in the radial direction.

The temperature distribution would then be a function of the radius r and the position along the pipe x. But since axial conduction is negligible, the temperature distribution depends mainly on the radial coordinate, not so much on x. Wait, but as the fluid flows, the temperature might vary along x because the fluid is moving. Or wait, no. Because the flow is fully developed, maybe the temperature only varies radially, but the bulk temperature could change along the pipe as heat is added. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the bulk mean temperature at x=0 is known. So at the starting point, the fluid has a bulk temperature T_b1. As it flows, it absorbs heat, so T_b would increase along the pipe. But the question is about deriving the local temperature distribution and the local h_x, so maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Let me think about the setup. The fluid flows with velocity profile u(r), which for laminar flow in a pipe is given by u(r) = (2U) (1 - (r^2/R^2))/2, where U is the bulk velocity. Wait, no, the bulk velocity is the average velocity. The velocity profile for laminar flow is parabolic: u(r) = (U * R^2/(2)) (1 - (r^2/R^2)).

Wait, no, the maximum velocity is at the center, and u_max = 2U, where U is the average or bulk velocity. So the velocity at radius r is u(r) = U (1 - (r^2/R^2)).

But maybe I don't need the velocity profile for this particular problem. Since the question is about heat transfer, perhaps I can model this using the energy equation.

In the radial direction, the heat equation would be governed by conduction and advection. But wait, since the flow is steady and the velocity is fully developed, maybe the temperature variation along x is negligible, so we can model it as a one-dimensional problem in the radial direction.

Wait, but axial conduction is negligible, so the heat transfer is radial. So the temperature distribution T(r, x) can be treated as depending only on r, not x. Or maybe not, because as the fluid moves along x, it's absorbing heat, so the bulk temperature T_b would increase. Hmm, but the question is about the local heat transfer coefficient, so perhaps each cross-section at position x has its own T_b(x). 

Wait, maybe I should model this as a steady-state heat conduction in a cylindrical coordinate system, considering the convective boundary condition at the wall.

So, the general approach might be to set up the differential equation for heat conduction in the radial direction, considering the convective boundary condition at r=R and the bulk temperature at r=0.

Assuming steady-state, the energy equation in cylindrical coordinates (since the pipe is circular) would be:

(1/r) d/dr (r * dT/dr) = 0

Wait, no. If there's advection, then the equation would include the advective term. But since the flow is steady and fully developed, and the velocity is only in the axial direction, maybe the advection term is important. Alternatively, if the problem states that axial conduction is negligible, perhaps the temperature variation along x is negligible, so we can ignore the axial derivatives. 

Wait, the problem says axial conduction is negligible compared to radial conduction, so perhaps we can model the heat transfer as purely radial, which would mean that the temperature distribution is only a function of r, not x. That would simplify things.

So, the differential equation for steady-state, one-dimensional heat conduction in the radial direction would be:

d²T/dr² + (1/r) dT/dr = 0

This is the Laplace equation for temperature in the radial direction, assuming no heat sources or sinks except at the boundary.

Integrating this equation, the general solution is T(r) = A ln(r) + B.

Wait, but that's a bit tricky because ln(r) can cause issues at r=0, but maybe we can adjust the boundary conditions.

But let's think about the boundary conditions. At the wall (r=R), the heat flux is given by q_w, which is the heat transfer per unit area. So the boundary condition at r=R is:

-k * dT/dr(R) = q_w

Because heat flux q = -k * (dT/dr), where k is the thermal conductivity.

At the center of the pipe (r=0), we need another boundary condition. Since the fluid is flowing, perhaps the temperature at the center is the bulk temperature T_b. But wait, the bulk temperature is the average temperature of the fluid in the cross-section. Alternatively, maybe the temperature at r=0 is T_b, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps the bulk temperature is T_b, which is the average temperature of the fluid in the cross-sectional area. So, the temperature at r=0 might not directly be T_b, but the bulk temperature is T_b, and the temperature distribution is around that.

Wait, but how do we relate T(r) to T_b? The bulk temperature T_b is given by the average temperature in the cross-section:

T_b = (1/A) ∫∫ T(r) r dr dθ, integrated over the area A of the pipe.

So, for a circular pipe, A = π R², and the integral becomes:

T_b = (1/(π R²)) ∫ (from 0 to 2π) ∫ (from 0 to R) T(r) r dr dθ

Since T(r) is only a function of r, the integral over θ would just give 2π, so:

T_b = (2/(R²)) ∫ (from 0 to R) T(r) r dr

So, T(r) = A ln(r) + B

Now, applying the boundary condition at r=R: 

-k * dT/dr(R) = q_w → -k (A/R) )= q_w → A = -q_w R / k

So, T(r) = (-q_w R/k) ln(r) + B

Now, apply the condition at r=0. Wait, but ln(r) approaches negative infinity as r approaches 0, which would make T(r) go to negative infinity unless B cancels that. But that can't be right because the bulk temperature is finite.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the general solution. Alternatively, maybe the problem requires a different approach, considering the convective boundary condition.

Wait, another possibility is that the heat transfer is between the fluid and the pipe wall, with the wall at a constant temperature. But the problem states that heat is being transferred from the walls to the fluid, so the wall is at a higher temperature than the fluid. Alternatively, if the wall is at a constant temperature T_w, then the boundary condition at r=R would involve the convective term, but perhaps the problem is assuming that the wall is at a higher temperature and the heat is conducted into the fluid.

Wait, maybe I should model this using the convection condition at the wall. The local heat transfer coefficient h_x would be related to the heat flux at the wall as q''_w = h_x (T_w - T_f), where T_f is the fluid temperature at the wall. But in this problem, the heat is being transferred at a constant rate q_w per unit area, which I think is the heat flux q''_w, so q_w = q''_w = h_x (T_w - T_f(R)).

But I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should start by writing the energy equation more carefully.

In the radial direction, considering steady-state and neglecting axial conduction and heat generation, the equation would be:

d/dr (r dT/dr) = 0

Integrating once gives r dT/dr = C

Integrating again gives T(r) = C ln(r) + D

Now, applying the boundary condition at r=R. The heat flux at the wall is q''_w = -k (dT/dr)|_{r=R}

So, dT/dr at R is (dT/dr) = C / r → at r=R, dT/dr = C / R

So, q''_w = -k (C/R) → C = -q''_w R / k

So, T(r) = (-q''_w R /k) ln(r) + D

Now, apply the other boundary condition. Since the fluid's bulk temperature T_b is at x=0, perhaps the average temperature of the fluid is T_b. So, the average T over the cross-section is T_b.

So, T_b = (1/(π R²)) ∫ (from 0 to R) ∫ (from 0 to 2π) T(r) r dθ dr

= (2/(R²)) ∫ (0 to R) [ (-q''_w R /k) ln(r) + D ] r dr

Let me compute that integral.

First, ∫ (0 to R) [ (-q''_w R /k) ln(r) + D ] r dr

= (-q''_w R/k) ∫ (0 to R) ln(r) r dr + D ∫ (0 to R) r dr

Compute each integral separately.

∫ r ln(r) dr from 0 to R:

Integration by parts: let u = ln(r), dv = r dr

du = (1/r) dr, v = (1/2) r²

So, uv - ∫ v du = (1/2 r² ln r) - ∫ (1/2 r²)(1/r) dr = (1/2 r² ln r) - (1/2) ∫ r dr = (1/2 r² ln r) - (1/4 r²) ) evaluated from 0 to R.

At R: (1/2 R² ln R) - (1/4 R²)

At 0: limit as r→0 of (1/2 r² ln r) is 0 (since r² approaches zero faster than ln r approaches -infty). Similarly, (1/4 r²) approaches zero.

So, ∫ r ln r dr from 0 to R = (1/2 R² ln R - 1/4 R²)

Similarly, ∫ r dr from 0 to R is (1/2 R²)

So, putting it back:

T_b = (2/(R²)) [ (-q''_w R/k) (1/2 R² ln R - 1/4 R²) ) + D (1/2 R²) ) ]

Simplify:

= (2/(R²)) [ (-q''_w R/k) ( (R² (2 ln R -1 )) /4 ) + D (R²/2) ) ]

Wait, wait. Let me compute each term correctly.

First term: (-q''_w R/k) * (1/2 R² ln R - 1/4 R²) )

= (-q''_w R/k) [ (R² (2 ln R - 1 )) /4 ]

= (-q''_w R/k) * (R² (2 ln R -1 )) /4

= (-q''_w R^3 (2 ln R -1 )) / (4k)

Second term: D * (1/2 R²)

So, putting it all together inside the brackets:

[ (-q''_w R^3 (2 ln R -1 )) / (4k) + D (R²/2) )

Then multiply by (2/(R²)):

T_b = (2/(R²)) [ (-q''_w R^3 (2 ln R -1 )) / (4k) + (D R²)/2 )

Simplify each term:

First term: (2/(R²)) * [ (-q''_w R^3 (2 ln R -1 )) / (4k) ) ] 

= [ (-q''_w R (2 ln R -1 )) ] / (2k)

Second term: (2/(R²)) * (D R²/2) ) = D

So, T_b = [ (-q''_w R (2 ln R -1 )) ] / (2k) + D

But I can rearrange this to solve for D:

D = T_b - [ (-q''_w R (2 ln R -1 )) ] / (2k )

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is the right approach. Maybe there's a simpler way. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the local heat transfer coefficient h_x, which is defined as h_x = q''_w / (T_w - T_f), where T_f is the fluid temperature at the wall. But in this case, the wall is transferring heat to the fluid, so T_w > T_f.

Wait, but in our setup, the wall is at a temperature T_w, and the fluid's temperature at the wall is T_f(R) = T(r=R). So, from the temperature profile we have T(r) = (-q''_w R/k) ln(r) + D. At r=R, T(R) = (-q''_w R/k) ln(R) + D.

But I'm not sure if that's the right way to model it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the wall is at a constant temperature T_w, and the fluid's temperature at the wall is T_f = T_w - (q''_w)/(h_x). Hmm, maybe I'm complicating things.

Wait, perhaps another approach. For fully developed laminar flow in a circular pipe, the temperature distribution can be found using the solution for the energy equation, which combines conduction and convection.

I remember that for such a case, the temperature profile is given by:

T(r) = T_b [1 + (4 α u_max)/(k R) ∫ (from r to R) (1/s) ds ]

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Alternatively, the general solution for the temperature distribution in a circular pipe with constant heat flux at the wall is known.

Wait, maybe I should recall that when the heat transfer is due to constant heat flux (q''_w), the temperature distribution in a circular pipe is given by T(r) = (q''_w R)/(k) [ln(R/r) - 1] + T_f_avg, where T_f_avg is the bulk temperature.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is T(r) = (q''_w R^2)/(k) [ (1/r) - (1/R) ) ] + T_f_avg.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for the standard solution for this scenario.

Wait, I think the standard solution when the wall is subjected to a constant heat flux q''_w is:

T(r) = (q''_w R^2)/(k) [ (1/r) - (1/R) ) ] + T_f_avg

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to approach this systematically.

In a circular pipe with radius R, the temperature distribution for constant heat flux at the wall (q''_w) can be found by solving the energy equation in cylindrical coordinates.

The energy equation (steady-state, no heat sources, neglecting axial conduction) is:

(d/dr) [ r (dT/dr) ] = 0

Integrating once gives r dT/dr = C

Integrating again gives T(r) = C ln(r) + D

Now, applying boundary conditions:

1. At r=R, the heat flux is q''_w = -k (dT/dr)|_{r=R} → -k (C/R) = q''_w → C = - q''_w R / k

2. The average temperature in the cross-section is T_b, so:

T_b = (1/(π R²)) ∫ (from 0 to R) ∫ (from 0 to 2π) T(r) r dθ dr

= (2/(R²)) ∫ (0 to R) [ (-q''_w R/k) ln(r) + D ] r dr

Let me compute this integral again.

∫ [ (-q''_w R/k) ln(r) + D ] r dr from 0 to R

= (-q''_w R/k) ∫ r ln(r) dr + D ∫ r dr

As before, ∫ r ln r dr from 0 to R is (1/2 R² ln R - 1/4 R²)

∫ r dr from 0 to R is (1/2 R²)

So, putting it together:

T_b = (2/(R²)) [ (-q''_w R/k)(1/2 R² ln R - 1/4 R²) + D (1/2 R²) ) ]

Simplify each term:

First term: (-q''_w R/k) * (1/2 R² ln R - 1/4 R²) = (-q''_w R/k) * R² ( (ln R)/2 - 1/4 )

= (-q''_w R^3/k) ( (2 ln R - 1)/4 )

So, this becomes (-q''_w R^3 (2 ln R -1 )) / (4k)

Second term: D * (1/2 R²)

So, T_b = (2/(R²)) [ (-q''_w R^3 (2 ln R -1 ))/(4k) + (D R²)/2 ]

Simplify each term inside:

= (2/(R²)) [ (-q''_w R^3 (2 ln R -1 ))/(4k) ) + (D R²)/2 ) ]

= [ 2/(R²) ] * [ (-q''_w R^3 (2 ln R -1 ))/(4k) + (D R²)/2 ]

= [ (-q''_w R (2 ln R -1 ))/(2k) ) + D ]

So, T_b = [ (-q''_w R (2 ln R -1 ))/(2k) ) + D ]

Rearranged, D = T_b + [ q''_w R (2 ln R -1 ) ]/(2k )

Now, the temperature distribution is:

T(r) = (-q''_w R/k) ln(r) + D 

= (-q''_w R/k) ln(r) + T_b + [ q''_w R (2 ln R -1 ) ]/(2k )

That's the temperature profile.

Now, to find the local heat transfer coefficient h_x at a point in the fluid, we can use the formula:

h_x = (q''_w) / (T_w - T_f(R))

But wait, in this case, the wall is at a higher temperature, and the fluid is absorbing heat. Alternatively, if the wall is at a constant temperature T_w, then T_f(R) is the fluid temperature at the wall, which would be T_w - (q''_w)/(h_x). But I'm not entirely sure about the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of Newton's law of cooling. The local heat transfer coefficient h_x is defined as:

q''_w = h_x (T_w - T_f)

Where T_f is the temperature of the fluid at the wall (r=R). From our temperature profile, T(R) = (-q''_w R/k) ln(R) + D

But D is T_b + [ q''_w R (2 ln R -1 ) ]/(2k )

So, T(R) = (-q''_w R/k) ln(R) + T_b + [ q''_w R (2 ln R -1 ) ]/(2k )

Simplify:

= T_b + [ (-q''_w R ln R)/k + q''_w R (2 ln R -1 )/(2k) ]

= T_b + [ (-2 q''_w R ln R)/(2k) + q''_w R (2 ln R -1 )/(2k) ]

Factor out q''_w R/(2k):

= T_b + (q''_w R)/(2k) [ -2 ln R + 2 ln R -1 ]

= T_b + (q''_w R)/(2k) [ -1 ]

= T_b - (q''_w R)/(2k )

So, T(R) = T_b - (q''_w R)/(2k )

Now, the temperature difference between the wall (T_w) and the fluid at the wall (T_f(R)) is:

ΔT = T_w - T_f(R) = T_w - [ T_b - (q''_w R)/(2k) ) ]

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's try another approach. Maybe the bulk temperature T_b is the average temperature, and the temperature at the wall is T(R) = T_b + (something). Alternatively, perhaps I should express h_x in terms of q''_w and the temperature gradient.

Wait, from the boundary condition, we have q''_w = -k (dT/dr)|_{r=R} = h_x (T_w - T_f(R))

But from our earlier expression, T(r) = (-q''_w R/k) ln(r) + D, and we have D in terms of T_b, q''_w, R, and k.

But perhaps it's easier to relate h_x with the bulk temperature and the velocity profile. I remember that in laminar flow, the bulk temperature change can be related to the heat transfer, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the mean heat transfer coefficient. Wait, but the question is about the local h_x, which varies with position because the velocity profile varies with radius.

Wait, no, in a circular pipe, the local heat transfer coefficient at a point depends on the velocity at that point. Since the velocity profile is u(r) = (U R^2/2)(1 - r²/R²), the maximum velocity is at the center, u=U.

Wait, but for a fully developed laminar flow in a circular pipe, the velocity profile is given by:

u(r) = (U R²/(2)) (1 - (r²/R²)) )

So, the velocity at a radius r is u(r) = U (1 - (r²/R²)).

The bulk velocity U is related to the volumetric flow rate. But how does this relate to the heat transfer coefficient?

The local heat transfer coefficient h_x(r) is defined as h_x(r) = (q''_w) / (T_w - T_f(r))

But in our case, the wall is at a higher temperature, so T_f(r) is the temperature of the fluid at radius r. But I'm not sure if that's the right way to model it. Alternatively, perhaps the fluid's temperature at the wall (r=R) is T_f(R), and the wall is at T_w.

Wait, perhaps I should express h_x in terms of the velocity at the point. Because the local h_x depends on the local velocity, which is highest at the center and lowest near the wall.

Wait, I think the correct approach is to use the formula for h_x in a circular pipe with constant heat flux. From my notes, I recall that for a circular pipe with constant heat flux, the local Nusselt number Nu_x(r) is given by:

Nu_x(r) = (h_x r)/k = 2 (1 + (r^2)/(2 R^2)) [something]

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Another approach is to use the formula that relates h_x to the velocity profile.

In the case of laminar flow, the local heat transfer coefficient can be expressed as h_x(r) = (k/k_w) * (u(r)/u_max), where k_w is some thermal conductivity term, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I remember that in a circular pipe with constant heat flux, the local Nusselt number is given by:

Nu_x(r) = (h_x r)/k = 2 (1 + (r^2)/(2 R^2)) (1 + (r^2)/(4 R^2))

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the expression for h_x in terms of the velocity at radius r.

Wait, another approach: Since the flow is laminar and the velocity profile is known, the convective heat transfer coefficient h_x can be related to the velocity at that point. The formula for h_x in a circular pipe with constant heat flux is given by:

h_x = (8 k) / (3 R) * (1 + (r^2)/(2 R^2)) 

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula h_x = (4 k) / (R) * (1 + (r^2)/(2 R^2)).

But I'm not confident. Maybe I should think about the bulk heat transfer coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the average heat transfer coefficient is what's being asked, but the question specifies local h_x.

Wait, perhaps I should use the velocity profile to find the local h_x. The velocity at radius r is u(r) = U (1 - (r^2/R^2)), where U is the bulk velocity.

In a circular pipe, the bulk velocity U is related to the maximum velocity u_max = 2U. So, U = u_max / 2.

Wait, but how does this relate to h_x? I think the local h_x is proportional to the local velocity. The formula for h_x in a circular pipe under constant heat flux is known, and I think the expression involves terms like (1 + (r^2)/(2 R^2)).

Wait, perhaps the local Nusselt number in a circular pipe with constant heat flux is given by:

Nu_x(r) = (h_x r)/k = (4/3) (1 + (r^2)/(2 R^2)) 

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, I've heard that for constant heat flux, the Nusselt number varies with the square of the radius.

Wait, perhaps I should find the expression for the temperature profile and then compute h_x from that.

From earlier, we have T(r) = (q''_w R^2)/(k) [ (1/r) - (1/R) ) ] + T_b

Wait, no, earlier I had T(r) = (-q''_w R/k) ln(r) + D, which after applying the boundary conditions became T(r) = T_b - (q''_w R)/(2k) + (q''_w R ln(r/R))/k )

Wait, perhaps simplifying, T(r) = T_b + (q''_w R/k) (ln(R/r) - 1/2 )

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to relate the local heat flux to the temperature gradient.

Wait, the heat flux at the wall is q''_w = h_x (T_w - T_f(R)), but I'm not sure about T_f(R). Alternatively, perhaps the bulk temperature T_b is related to the average of T(r).

Wait, another approach: Maybe the local heat transfer coefficient h_x can be found using the formula h_x = (k/k_w) * (u(r)/u_max), but I'm not certain about the exact form.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression for h_x in this scenario is h_x = (8 k)/(3 R) * (1 + (r^2)/(2 R^2)).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think that for a circular pipe with constant heat flux, the local Nusselt number is given by:

Nu_x(r) = (h_x r)/k = 2 (1 + (r^2)/(2 R^2)) (1 + (r^2)/(4 R^2))

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression is h_x = (4 k)/(R) * (1 + (r^2)/(2 R^2)).

Wait, but I'm not confident. Maybe I should look for a standard result.

Wait, I found a reference that says that for a circular pipe with constant heat flux, the local Nusselt number is given by:

Nu_x(r) = (h_x r)/k = 2 (1 + (r^2)/(2 R^2)) (1 + (r^2)/(4 R^2)).

But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression is:

h_x = (4 k)/(R) * (1 + (r^2)/(2 R^2)).

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression is h_x = (8 k)/(3 R) * (1 + (r^2)/(2 R^2)).

Wait, but the options given are in terms of (k/D), where D is the diameter, so D = 2R. So, substituting D=2R, then R = D/2, and expressions would involve (k/D) multiplied by some factor.

Looking at the options, the possible answers are multiples of (k/D). So, perhaps the correct expression is h_x = 2.18 (k/D), which is option C, or another option.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the bulk heat transfer coefficient. The bulk Nusselt number for a circular pipe with constant heat flux is known to be around 3.66, which is option I. But the question is about the local h_x, not the average.

Wait, but the options include 3.66 (k/D) as option I. If the local h_x varies with r, then at the center (r=0), h_x would be lower, and near the wall (r=R), higher. But the options are all constants, which suggests that perhaps the question is asking for the bulk or average heat transfer coefficient.

Wait, but the question specifically asks for the local h_x, so perhaps the options are giving a general expression. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that h_x is constant, which it's not. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The problem states that heat is being transferred at a constant rate q_w per unit area. That is, q_w = q''_w. So, the heat flux at the wall is constant, which is a different scenario than constant wall temperature.

In this case, the temperature distribution would be different. Let's try solving the energy equation again under this condition.

The energy equation in cylindrical coordinates, steady-state, no sources, and neglecting axial conduction:

d/dr (r dT/dr) = 0

Integrate once: r dT/dr = C

Integrate again: T(r) = C ln r + D

At r=R, the boundary condition is q''_w = -k (dT/dr)|_{r=R} → -k (C/R) = q''_w → C = - q''_w R /k

So, T(r) = (- q''_w R /k) ln r + D

Now, the average temperature T_b is given by:

T_b = (1/(π R²)) ∫ (0 to R) ∫ (0 to 2π) T(r) r dθ dr

= (2/(R²)) ∫ (0 to R) [ (-q''_w R/k) ln r + D ] r dr

Compute the integral:

= (2/(R²)) [ (-q''_w R/k) ∫ (0 to R) r ln r dr + D ∫ (0 to R) r dr ]

As before, ∫ r ln r dr from 0 to R is (1/2 R² ln R - 1/4 R²)

And ∫ r dr from 0 to R is (1/2 R²)

So,

= (2/(R²)) [ (-q''_w R/k)(1/2 R² ln R - 1/4 R²) + D (1/2 R²) )

Simplify:

= (2/(R²)) [ (-q''_w R (R² (2 ln R -1 )) /4 ) /k + (D R²)/2 )

= (2/(R²)) [ (-q''_w R^3 (2 ln R -1 )) / (4k) + (D R²)/2 )

= (2/(R²)) * [ (-q''_w R^3 (2 ln R -1 )) / (4k) + (D R²)/2 )

= [ (-q''_w R (2 ln R -1 )) ]/(2k) + D

So, T_b = [ (-q''_w R (2 ln R -1 )) ]/(2k) + D

Solving for D:

D = T_b - [ (-q''_w R (2 ln R -1 )) ]/(2k )

= T_b + [ q''_w R (2 ln R -1 ) ]/(2k )

So, the temperature distribution is:

T(r) = (-q''_w R/k) ln r + T_b + [ q''_w R (2 ln R -1 ) ]/(2k )

Simplify:

= T_b + (-q''_w R/k) ln r + [ q''_w R (2 ln R -1 ) ]/(2k )

Factor out q''_w R/(2k):

= T_b + (q''_w R/(2k)) [ -2 ln r + 2 ln R -1 ]

= T_b + (q''_w R/(2k)) [ 2 ln(R/r) -1 ]

So, T(r) = T_b + (q''_w R/(2k)) [ 2 ln(R/r) -1 ]

Now, to find h_x, which is the local heat transfer coefficient at a point, we can use the formula:

q''_w = h_x (T_w - T(r=R))

But wait, in this scenario, the wall is at a temperature T_w, and the fluid at the wall is at T(r=R). So,

q''_w = h_x (T_w - T(r=R))

But from the temperature profile, T(r=R) = T_b + (q''_w R/(2k)) [ 2 ln(1) -1 ] 

Because ln(R/R)=0, so:

T(R) = T_b + (q''_w R/(2k)) ( -1 )

= T_b - (q''_w R)/(2k )

So,

q''_w = h_x (T_w - (T_b - (q''_w R)/(2k )) )

But I'm not sure if this helps directly. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the bulk temperature and relate h_x to the velocity profile.

Wait, perhaps the local h_x can be expressed as h_x = (k/k_w) * (u(r)/u_max), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression for h_x in this case is:

h_x = (q''_w) / (T_w - T(r=R)) )

But from earlier, T(r=R) = T_b - (q''_w R)/(2k )

So,

h_x = q''_w / (T_w - (T_b - (q''_w R)/(2k )) )

But without knowing T_w and T_b, this might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the bulk temperature T_b is related to the fluid's properties and the heat added.

Wait, perhaps the bulk temperature change can be found by considering the energy balance. The heat added per unit volume is q''_w * 2π R L, where L is the length of the pipe. The mass flow rate is ρ u_max π R² /4, since for a circular pipe, the volumetric flow rate Q = π R² U, where U is the bulk velocity.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression for h_x in this scenario is (8 k)/(3 R), which when expressed in terms of D=2R becomes (8 k)/(3*(D/2)) ) = (16 k)/(3 D), which is approximately 5.33 (k/D). But none of the options match this exactly.

Wait, looking back at the options, option I is 3.66 (k/D). I think that 3.66 is a familiar number for the average Nusselt number in a circular pipe with constant heat flux. But the question is about the local h_x, not the average.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the correct expression for h_x is (8 k)/(3 D), which would be 8/3 ≈ 2.666, but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C: 2.18 (k/D).

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression is h_x = (8.72 k)/D, which is option A.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the velocity profile and how h_x relates to it. Since the velocity is maximum at the center and decreases to zero at the wall, h_x would be maximum at the center. But that's the opposite of what I expect because typically, the heat transfer coefficient is higher where the velocity is higher.

Wait, no, in reality, higher velocity means more mass flow, which can increase the heat transfer coefficient. Wait, but in this case, the velocity is higher in the center, so perhaps h_x is higher there.

Wait, but I'm not sure. I think I need to find a standard formula for h_x in a circular pipe with constant heat flux.

Upon checking my notes, I find that for a circular pipe with constant heat flux (q''_w), the local Nusselt number is given by:

Nu_x(r) = (h_x r)/k = 2 (1 + (r^2)/(2 R^2)) (1 + (r^2)/(4 R^2)).

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression is:

h_x = (8 k)/(3 R) [1 + (r^2)/(2 R^2)]

Which, when expressed in terms of D=2R, becomes:

h_x = (8 k)/(3 (D/2)) [1 + (r^2)/(2 (D/2)^2)] = (16 k)/(3 D) [1 + (r^2)/(2 (D²/4))] = (16 k)/(3 D) [1 + (2 r²)/(D²) ]

But this still doesn't directly match the options. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C: 2.18 (k/D), but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: The average Nusselt number for a circular pipe with constant heat flux is about 3.66, which corresponds to option I. But the question is about the local h_x, not the average. However, if the question is asking for an expression in terms of k/D, and assuming that the local h_x at the center is lower, but the maximum h_x at the wall is higher, perhaps the given options are for the average.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression for h_x is h_x = (8 k)/(3 D) * (1 + (r^2)/(2 R^2)), which when R = D/2 becomes:

h_x = (8 k)/(3 D) * [1 + (r^2)/(2 (D²/4)))] = (8 k)/(3 D) * [1 + (2 r²)/(D²) ]

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C: 2.18 (k/D).

Wait, I think I've made a mistake earlier. Let me try to compute the local heat transfer coefficient correctly. The local h_x is given by:

h_x = (q''_w) / (T_w - T_f(r=R))

But from the temperature profile, T(r=R) = T_b - (q''_w R)/(2k )

So, T_w - T(r=R) = T_w - T_b + (q''_w R)/(2k )

But without knowing T_w, this is not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the bulk temperature T_b is related to the average of T(r), so:

T_b = (1/(π R²)) ∫∫ T(r) r dr dθ = ... which we did earlier, leading to the expression involving q''_w.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to find h_x in terms of the velocity u(r) and the thermal conductivity k. I recall that for laminar flow, the local h_x can be expressed as:

h_x = (k u(r)) / (ν) * (1 + (r^2)/(2 R^2))

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression is:

h_x = (4 k u(r)) / (R^2) * (1 + (r^2)/(2 R^2))

But without the exact formula, it's hard to proceed.

Given the time I've spent and the options provided, I think the correct answer is option I: h_x = 3.66 (k/D), which corresponds to the average Nusselt number for a circular pipe with constant heat flux. However, since the question asks for the local h_x, which varies with r, perhaps the intended answer is option C: 2.18 (k/D), which is roughly 8/3.66, but I'm not certain.

Wait, 8/3.66 is approximately 2.18. So perhaps option C is the correct one, representing the local h_x at a certain point.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I: 3.66 (k/D), which is the known average value.

Given that I'm a bit stuck, I'll make an educated guess that the correct answer is option I: 3.66 (k/D).

To determine the local heat transfer coefficient \( h_x \) for a fluid flowing in a circular pipe with laminar, fully developed flow and constant heat flux \( q_w \), the following analysis is considered:

1. **Problem Setup**: The fluid flows in a circular pipe with radius \( R \), and heat is transferred from the walls to the fluid at a constant rate \( q_w \) per unit area. The flow is laminar and fully developed, with negligible axial conduction. The bulk mean temperature \( T_{b1} \) is known at \( x = 0 \).

2. **Temperature Distribution**: The steady-state heat conduction equation in the radial direction is solved, leading to the temperature profile:
   \[
   T(r) = T_b + \frac{q_w R}{2k} \left[ 2 \ln\left(\frac{R}{r}\right) - 1 \right]
   \]
   where \( T_b \) is the bulk temperature.

3. **Local Heat Transfer Coefficient**: The local heat transfer coefficient \( h_x \) is related to the heat flux at the wall \( q_w \) and the temperature difference between the wall and the fluid. For a circular pipe with constant heat flux, the local \( h_x \) is proportional to the velocity profile and depends on the radius \( r \).

4. **Options Analysis**: The options provided are multiples of \( (k/D) \), where \( D = 2R \). The known average Nusselt number for a circular pipe with constant heat flux is approximately 3.66, which corresponds to \( h_x = 3.66 (k/D) \). This matches option I.

5. **Conclusion**: While the local \( h_x \) varies with \( r \), the problem likely refers to the bulk or average heat transfer coefficient, which is a standard result for this configuration.
