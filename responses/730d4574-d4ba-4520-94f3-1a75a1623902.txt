Question:

You’ve made a scientific theory that there is an attractive force between all objects. When will your theory be proven to be correct?

Options:

A: When the theory can predict future observations.
B: As soon as you propose the theory.
C: When your theory becomes a law.
D: You can never prove your theory to be correct only “yet to be proven wrong”.
E: When the scientific community accepts it as a fact.
F: The first time you drop a bowling ball and it falls to the ground proving your hypothesis.
G: After you’ve repeated your experiment many times.
H: When you and many others have tested the hypothesis.
I: After a single successful experiment that supports your hypothesis.
J: When the theory is published in a scientific journal.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about scientific theories and when they're proven correct. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a theory proposing an attractive force between all objects. I remember that in science, theories aren't proven in the same way as, say, mathematical proofs. They are more about explaining phenomena and being supported by evidence. So, when does a theory get proven correct?

Looking at the options:

A: When the theory can predict future observations. Hmm, I think this relates to how theories are validated. If a theory can predict something that happens, that supports it, but does that prove it's correct? Maybe, but I'm not sure.

B: As soon as you propose the theory. No, that doesn't make sense. Proposing it doesn't mean it's correct; you need evidence.

C: When your theory becomes a law. Wait, aren't laws different from theories? Laws are descriptions of how things work, while theories explain why. So becoming a law doesn't prove the theory correct.

D: You can never prove your theory to be correct only “yet to be proven wrong”. This sounds familiar. I think in the scientific method, you can't prove something absolutely; you can only fail to disprove it. So the theory remains until evidence contradicts it.

E: When the scientific community accepts it as a fact. Well, acceptance by the community can happen, but that's more about consensus rather than proof. The theory is useful and widely accepted, but not necessarily proven.

F: The first time you drop a bowling ball and it falls. That's just one experiment. While it supports the theory, one instance isn't enough to prove it. There could be other variables or exceptions.

G: After you’ve repeated your experiment many times. Replication is important for validity, but even after many experiments, it's still just evidence supporting the theory, not proof.

H: When you and many others have tested the hypothesis. Similar to G, this is about gathering more evidence, but again, it's about support rather than proof.

I: After a single successful experiment. No, like F, one experiment isn't sufficient. It could be a fluke or have other issues.

J: When the theory is published in a scientific journal. Publishing shows it's been through peer review, but that doesn't mean it's proven. It's just been vetted for methodology.

So, putting this together, the key point is that in science, you can't prove a theory correct beyond doubt. Instead, you can only have evidence that supports it, and it remains until it's contradicted. So option D seems to be the correct answer. It's about not being able to prove it correct, only failing to find it wrong.

The correct answer is D: You can never prove your theory to be correct only “yet to be proven wrong”. In science, theories are supported by evidence but cannot be proven absolutely correct. They remain until evidence contradicts them.

Answer: D
