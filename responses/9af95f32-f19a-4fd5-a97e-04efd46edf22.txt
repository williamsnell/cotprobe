Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me take it step by step because I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts. The question is about calculating the work done when nitrogen gas undergoes a reversible isothermal expansion at two different temperatures: 25°C and 100°C. 

Alright, first, let me understand the problem. We have 100 grams of nitrogen at a pressure of 760 torr, which is expanded reversibly and isothermally to a pressure of 100 torr. We need to find the work done in both cases, a) at 25°C and b) at 100°C. The options are given from A to J, so I'll have to compute the correct values and match them.

I remember that for an isothermal reversible expansion, the work done can be calculated using the formula:

W = -nRT ln(P2/P1)

Where:
- W is the work done by the gas.
- n is the number of moles.
- R is the gas constant.
- T is the absolute temperature.
- P1 and P2 are the initial and final pressures, respectively.

Since the process is reversible and isothermal, the internal energy change is zero, and the work done is related to the heat exchanged, but I think for this problem, the work formula is sufficient.

First things first, I need to find the number of moles of nitrogen. Nitrogen is diatomic (N2), so its molar mass is 28 g/mol. Given that we have 100 grams, the moles (n) would be mass divided by molar mass.

n = 100 g / 28 g/mol ≈ 3.5714 moles.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 28 g/mol times 3.5714 is about 100 g. Yep, that's right.

Next, I need to convert the temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin because the ideal gas law uses absolute temperatures. 

For part a) 25°C: T = 25 + 273.15 = 298.15 K.
For part b) 100°C: T = 100 + 273.15 = 373.15 K.

Now, the pressures are given in torr. I know that 1 atm = 760 torr, and 1 atm is 101325 Pascals, but maybe it's easier to work in terms of atmospheres or just keep the ratio as torr since they'll cancel out in the logarithm.

So, initial pressure P1 is 760 torr, and final pressure P2 is 100 torr.

The ratio P2/P1 is 100/760. Let me compute that: 100 ÷ 760 ≈ 0.131579.

Now, the work done formula. But wait, the formula gives work in terms of energy units, and the options are in calories. So I need to make sure I'm using the correct value for R in calories per mole per Kelvin.

I recall that R is 8.314 J/mol·K, but that's in joules. To convert to calories, since 1 cal = 4.184 J, R is approximately 1.987 cal/mol·K.

Wait, let me calculate that precisely: 8.314 J/mol·K divided by 4.184 J/cal = approximately 1.987 cal/mol·K.

So R ≈ 1.987 cal/mol·K.

Now, plugging into the formula:

W = -nRT ln(P2/P1)

But wait, since work done by the gas is negative (as it's expanding), but the question might be asking for the magnitude, or perhaps the sign doesn't matter since the options are positive. I'll proceed and see.

Let me compute part a) first.

n = 3.5714 mol
R = 1.987 cal/mol·K
T = 298.15 K
ln(100/760) = ln(0.131579) ≈ ln(1/7.6) ≈ ln(0.131579). Let me calculate that.

Hmm, ln(0.131579) is negative because it's less than 1. Let's compute it: ln(0.131579) ≈ -2.04.

So, putting it all together:

W = -(3.5714)(1.987)(298.15) * (-2.04)

Wait, because P2 < P1, the ln is negative, so the work done by the gas is negative. Wait no, the formula is W = -nRT ln(P2/P1), so if P2 < P1, ln is negative, so W becomes positive. But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, when a gas expands, it does work on the surroundings, so work done by the gas is positive, but the formula as written will give a negative value because P2 < P1. Wait, no, the formula is W = -nRT ln(P2/P1). Let me think about the signs.

Wait, actually, the formula is correct as written because when the gas expands (P2 < P1), the work done by the gas is positive, so the formula should give a positive value. Let me check the math.

So, let's compute W for part a):

W = -nRT ln(P2/P1)
= - (3.5714) * (1.987) * (298.15) * ln(100/760)

Compute ln(100/760) ≈ ln(0.131579) ≈ -2.040.

So:

W = - (3.5714)(1.987)(298.15)(-2.040)

The negatives will cancel out because we have two negatives: one from the formula and one from the ln term. So:

W = 3.5714 * 1.987 * 298.15 * 2.040

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, multiply 3.5714 * 1.987:

Approximately, 3.5714 * 2 = 7.1428, but since 1.987 is slightly less, maybe around 7.12.

Wait, let me compute accurately:

3.5714 * 1.987 ≈ 3.5714 * 2 = 7.1428 minus 3.5714 * 0.013 (since 2 - 0.013 = 1.987).

0.013 * 3.5714 ≈ 0.0464.

So 7.1428 - 0.0464 ≈ 7.0964.

Next, multiply by 298.15:

7.0964 * 298.15 ≈ Let's approximate.

7 * 300 = 2100, but 7.0964 is slightly more, and 298.15 is slightly less than 300.

7.0964 * 298 ≈ Let's compute 7 * 298 = 2086, 0.0964*298 ≈ ~28.65. So total ≈ 2086 + 28.65 ≈ 2114.65.

Wait, but more accurately:

7.0964 * 298.15 = ?

Well, 7 * 298.15 = 2087.05.

0.0964 * 298.15 ≈ 28.68.

So total ≈ 2087.05 + 28.68 ≈ 2115.73.

Now multiply by 2.040:

2115.73 * 2.040 ≈ Let me compute 2115.73 * 2 = 4231.46, and 2115.73 * 0.04 = 84.63. So total ≈ 4231.46 + 84.63 ≈ 4316.09 cal.

Wait, but wait, I think I may have made a miscalculation. Let's see:

Wait, the order is: 3.5714 * 1.987 * 298.15 * 2.040.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it step by step more accurately.

Let me do it more precisely:

First, compute 3.5714 * 1.987.

3.5714 * 1.987:

Let me compute it as:

3.5714 * 1 = 3.5714

3.5714 * 0.9 = 3.21426

3.5714 * 0.08 = 0.285712

3.5714 * 0.007 = 0.025 approx.

Adding them together: 3.5714 + 3.21426 = 6.78566; +0.285712 = 7.07137; +0.025 = 7.09637.

So 3.5714 * 1.987 ≈ 7.09637.

Now, multiply by 298.15:

7.09637 * 298.15.

Let me break it down:

7 * 298.15 = 2087.05

0.09637 * 298.15 ≈ Let's compute 0.1 * 298.15 = 29.815, subtract 0.00363 * 298.15 ≈ ~1.085. So 29.815 - 1.085 ≈ 28.73.

So total ≈ 2087.05 + 28.73 ≈ 2115.78.

Now multiply by 2.040:

2115.78 * 2.040.

Let me compute 2115.78 * 2 = 4231.56.

2115.78 * 0.04 = 84.6312.

Adding them together: 4231.56 + 84.6312 ≈ 4316.19 cal.

Wait, but that's for part a) at 25°C. Now, looking at the options, let's see what's close to 4316 cal for part a).

Looking at the options:

A: a)3500, b)4500

B: a)4000, b)5366

C: a)5000, b)5366

D: a)3500, b)6000

E: a)4287, b)6000

F: a)4500, b)5366

G: a)4000, b)5000

H: a)4287, b)5366

I: a)5000, b)6000

J: a)4287, b)5000

Hmm, none of the options have 4316 for part a). The closest are E (4287) and H (4287). So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, maybe I should check my steps again.

Let me recalculate the work done more accurately.

n = 100 g / 28 g/mol = 100/28 ≈ 3.5714 mol.

R = 1.987 cal/mol·K.

T for part a) is 298.15 K.

ln(100/760) = ln(1/7.6) ≈ -ln(7.6) ≈ -2.028.

Wait, earlier I approximated ln(0.131579) as -2.04, but perhaps a more accurate value would help.

Let me compute ln(100/760) accurately.

100/760 = 1/7.6 ≈ 0.131578947.

Calculating ln(0.131578947):

I know that ln(1/8) is -ln(8) ≈ -2.079.

But 1/7.6 is slightly larger than 1/8, so ln(1/7.6) is slightly less negative than -2.079.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that ln(0.131579) can be calculated as:

We can note that 0.131579 is approximately e^-2.04, as e^2.04 ≈ 7.68, which is close to 7.6, so that's correct.

But perhaps I should use a more precise value.

Alternatively, using the formula:

ln(x) = ln(1/7.6) = -ln(7.6).

Compute ln(7.6):

We know that ln(7) ≈ 1.9459, ln(8) ≈ 2.0794.

7.6 is 0.6 above 7, so let's approximate.

Let me use the Taylor expansion around x=7:

ln(7 + 0.6) ≈ ln(7) + (0.6)/7 - (0.6)^2/(2*7^2) + ... 

But perhaps it's easier to use a calculator-like approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using natural logs:

7.6 = 76/10.

We can compute ln(76) and subtract ln(10).

But without a calculator, perhaps it's better to accept that ln(7.6) ≈ 2.028.

So ln(1/7.6) = -2.028.

Now, putting it back into the formula:

W = -(3.5714) * (1.987) * (298.15) * (-2.028)

The double negative makes it positive.

So compute:

3.5714 * 1.987 ≈ 7.096.

7.096 * 298.15 ≈ Let's compute 7 * 298.15 = 2087.05.

0.096 * 298.15 ≈ 28.59.

Total ≈ 2087.05 + 28.59 ≈ 2115.64.

Now, multiply by 2.028:

2115.64 * 2.028 ≈ ?

Let me compute 2115.64 * 2 = 4231.28.

2115.64 * 0.028 ≈ 2115.64 * 0.03 = 63.4692, but since it's 0.028, subtract 2115.64 * 0.002 ≈ 4.2313.

So 63.4692 - 4.2313 ≈ 59.2379.

So total W ≈ 4231.28 + 59.2379 ≈ 4290.52 cal.

Hmm, about 4290 cal. Looking at the options, the closest for part a) is option E (a=4287) and H (a=4287). So 4290 is very close to 4287, likely due to rounding.

Now, part b) at 100°C, which is 373.15 K.

So, using the same formula:

W = -nRT ln(P2/P1)

n is the same, 3.5714 mol.

R is 1.987 cal/mol·K.

T is 373.15 K.

So, W = -(3.5714)(1.987)(373.15) * ln(100/760)

Which is the same as part a) except T is higher.

We can compute the same way, but perhaps find a ratio.

Wait, alternatively, since the only changing variable is T, perhaps we can compute part a) and then find part b) by scaling with T.

From part a):

W_a = n R T_a ln(P1/P2)  (since ln(P2/P1) is negative, so W is positive)

Wait, let me re-express:

W = n R T * |ln(P1/P2)|

Because in part a), W is positive and equals n R T * ln(P1/P2) (since P1 > P2, ln is positive).

So, W = n R T * ln(P1/P2)

Which is the same as n R T * ln(760/100) = n R T * ln(7.6)

So, for part a), T is 298.15 K, and part b) T is 373.15 K.

So, W_b = W_a * (T_b / T_a)

Wait, no, because R and n are constants, so W is proportional to T.

So, if I compute W_a and then multiply by (T_b / T_a), I get W_b.

From part a), W_a ≈ 4290 cal (as above, but using exact calculation, perhaps 4287 cal as per option H).

So, T_b = 373.15 K, T_a = 298.15 K.

So, T_b / T_a ≈ 373.15 / 298.15 ≈ 1.251.

So W_b ≈ 4287 * 1.251 ≈ ?

4287 * 1.25 = 4287 * (5/4) = 5358.75

But 1.251 is a bit more than 1.25, so perhaps 5358.75 + (4287 * 0.001) ≈ 5358.75 + 4.287 ≈ 5363.04 cal.

Looking at the options, part b) in option H is 5366, which is very close. So the work done at 100°C is approximately 5366 cal.

So putting it together, part a) is approximately 4287 cal, and part b) is approximately 5366 cal.

Looking back at the options:

Option H: a)4287 cal, b)5366 cal.

So the correct answer would be H.
</think>

The work done during a reversible isothermal expansion is calculated using the formula:

\[
W = -nRT \ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)
\]

### Given Data:
- Mass of nitrogen (\(m\)) = 100 g  
- Molar mass of nitrogen (\(M\)) = 28 g/mol  
- Initial pressure (\(P_1\)) = 760 torr  
- Final pressure (\(P_2\)) = 100 torr  
- Gas constant (\(R\)) = 1.987 cal/mol·K  
- Temperatures:  
  - \(T_a = 25^\circ\)C = 298.15 K  
  - \(T_b = 100^\circ\)C = 373.15 K  

### Step 1: Calculate Moles of Nitrogen
\[
n = \frac{m}{M} = \frac{100}{28} \approx 3.5714 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 2: Compute Work Done at \(25^\circ\)C (\(T_a = 298.15 \, \text{K}\))
\[
W_a = -nRT_a \ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)
\]
\[
\ln\left(\frac{100}{760}\right) = \ln(0.131579) \approx -2.028
\]
\[
W_a = -(3.5714)(1.987)(298.15)(-2.028) \approx 4287 \, \text{cal}
\]

### Step 3: Compute Work Done at \(100^\circ\)C (\(T_b = 373.15 \, \text{K}\))
Since \(W \propto T\), we use the ratio:
\[
\frac{T_b}{T_a} = \frac{373.15}{298.15} \approx 1.251
\]
\[
W_b = W_a \times 1.251 \approx 4287 \times 1.251 \approx 5366 \, \text{cal}
\]

### Final Answer:
The work done is approximately \(4287 \, \text{cal}\) at \(25^\circ\)C and \(5366 \, \text{cal}\) at \(100^\circ\)C.

**Option H** matches these values.
