Okay, I've got this thermodynamics problem about a Carnot refrigerator. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the question says that the refrigerator is maintaining an inside temperature of 5°C by rejecting heat to the surroundings at 27°C. Then, the inside temperature is decreased to -13°C, and we need to find the percent increase in work input for the same quantity of heat removed.

Hmm, right. I remember that a Carnot refrigerator operates in a reverse cycle, and its performance is described by the coefficient of performance (COP). The COP for a refrigerator is given by COP = Tc / (Th - Tc), where Tc is the temperature of the cold reservoir and Th is the temperature of the hot reservoir. But wait, in this case, the COP would be for the refrigerator, so I think the formula is COP = Tc / (Th - Tc).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the COP for a refrigerator is COP_refrigerator = (Qc) / W, where Qc is the heat removed from the cold reservoir, and W is the work input. Alternatively, another formula is COP_refrigerator = Tc / (Th - Tc), where Tc and Th are in Kelvin.

Right, so first, I should convert the temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin because the formulas require absolute temperatures.

So initial temperatures: Tc1 is 5°C, which is 5 + 273.15 = 278.15 K. Th remains at 27°C, which is 27 + 273.15 = 300.15 K.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the inside temperature is decreased to -13°C. So Tc2 is -13 + 273.15 = 260.15 K.

Wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, the inside temperature is the cold reservoir, so when it's decreased, Tc goes from 5°C to -13°C. So Tc1 = 5°C = 278.15 K, and Tc2 = -13°C = 260.15 K. Th remains at 27°C = 300.15 K.

So, the COP for the initial situation, COP1, is COP1 = Tc1 / (Th - Tc1). Let me compute that.

COP1 = 278.15 / (300.15 - 278.15) = 278.15 / 22 = approximately 12.643.

Wait, wait, let me calculate that exactly. 300.15 - 278.15 is 22 K. So 278.15 divided by 22 is about 12.643. So COP1 is about 12.643.

Now, COP2 when Tc is 260.15 K. So COP2 = 260.15 / (300.15 - 260.15). The denominator is 300.15 - 260.15 = 40 K. So 260.15 / 40 is 6.50375.

So the COP decreases because the denominator increases, which makes sense because the temperature difference between Th and Tc is larger.

Now, the COP is the ratio of heat removed (Qc) to work input (W). So COP = Qc / W. So W = Qc / COP.

Since the problem states that the same quantity of heat is removed, Qc remains the same. So the work input before was W1 = Qc / COP1, and after the change, it's W2 = Qc / COP2.

We need to find the percent increase in work input, so (W2 - W1) / W1 * 100%.

Let me compute W1 and W2.

Let's say Qc is some value, say Q. Then W1 = Q / COP1, and W2 = Q / COP2.

The ratio W2/W1 is (Q/COP2) / (Q/COP1) ) = COP1 / COP2.

So the percent increase is (W2/W1 - 1) * 100% = (COP1/COP2 - 1) * 100%.

So let's compute that.

From before: COP1 ≈ 12.643, COP2 ≈ 6.50375.

COP1/COP2 = 12.643 / 6.50375 ≈ let me calculate that.

12.643 ÷ 6.50375 ≈ approx 1.943.

Wait, let me compute it accurately:

6.50375 * 1.94 = let's see:

6.50375 * 1 = 6.50375

6.50375 * 0.9 = 5.853375

6.50375 * 0.04 = 0.26015

Adding up: 6.50375 +5.853375=12.357125; +0.26015=12.617275. Hmm, close to 12.643.

So 1.94 would give us about 6.50375 *1.94 = approx 12.617, which is a bit less than COP1 (12.643). Let me get a better approximation.

Let me compute 12.643 ÷6.50375.

Let me write it as 12.643 /6.50375.

Divide both numerator and denominator by 6.50375:

Calculate 12.643 ÷6.50375 ≈ let me do it step by step.

6.50375 * 1.943 = ?

Well, 6.50375 * 1.94 = 6.50375 * (2 - 0.06) = 13.0075 - 0.390225 = 12.617275.

So 1.94 gives 12.617275. The actual numerator is 12.643, which is 12.643 -12.617275=0.025725 more.

So, 0.025725 ÷6.50375 ≈ approx 0.003956.

So the ratio is approximately 1.94 + 0.003956 ≈1.943956.

So COP1/COP2≈1.943956.

So the percent increase is (1.943956 -1)*100% = 0.943956 *100% ≈94.3956%.

Wait, but that can't be right because looking at the options, I don't see 94.3%. Oh wait, option G is 94.5%, which is close.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, I think I might have made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me check my steps again.

Wait, the formula for COP is COP = Tc/(Th-Tc). So let me recompute COP1 and COP2.

COP1: Tc1 = 5°C=278.15 K, Th=300.15 K.

So COP1=278.15/(300.15-278.15)=278.15/22≈12.643.

COP2: Tc2=-13°C=260.15 K.

COP2=260.15/(300.15-260.15)=260.15/40≈6.50375.

So COP1/COP2=12.643/6.50375≈1.94395.

So the work input increases by a factor of 1.94395, which is a 94.395% increase. So the options are: I see option G is 94.5%, which matches closely.

Wait, but wait another thing—did I get the formula right? Because sometimes, depending on the convention, COP for refrigerators can be defined as Qc/(W), which is the same as Tc/(Th-Tc). So that part seems correct.

Alternatively, sometimes the COP is presented as (Th - Tc)/Tc, but I think that's for heat pumps. Let me confirm.

No, for refrigerators, COP is Qc/W. So the formula I used is correct.

So the percent increase is approximately 94.395%, which is closest to option G: 94.5%.

The problem involves a Carnot refrigerator operating at two different cold reservoir temperatures. The coefficient of performance (COP) for a refrigerator is given by \( \text{COP} = \frac{T_c}{T_h - T_c} \), where \( T_c \) and \( T_h \) are the absolute temperatures of the cold and hot reservoirs, respectively. 

Initially, the cold reservoir temperature is \( T_{c1} = 5^\circ \text{C} = 278.15 \, \text{K} \), and the hot reservoir temperature remains constant at \( T_h = 27^\circ \text{C} = 300.15 \, \text{K} \). The COP for this case is:

\[
\text{COP}_1 = \frac{278.15}{300.15 - 278.15} = \frac{278.15}{22} \approx 12.643
\]

When the cold reservoir temperature is decreased to \( T_{c2} = -13^\circ \text{C} = 260.15 \, \text{K} \), the new COP is:

\[
\text{COP}_2 = \frac{260.15}{300.15 - 260.15} = \frac{260.15}{40} \approx 6.50375
\]

The work input \( W \) is inversely proportional to the COP, so the ratio of the new work input to the original work input is:

\[
\frac{W_2}{W_1} = \frac{\text{COP}_1}{\text{COP}_2} = \frac{12.643}{6.50375} \approx 1.94395
\]

The percent increase in work input is:

\[
\left( \frac{W_2}{W_1} - 1 \right) \times 100\% = (1.94395 - 1) \times 100\% \approx 94.395\%
\]

This value is closest to option **G: 94.5%**.
