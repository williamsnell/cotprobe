Okay, so I have this question here about American approval ratings regarding a president running for a third term. The question is asking, before being reelected for a third term, how many Americans approved of running a third time? The options are from A to J, with various percentages.

First, I need to figure out which president this refers to. The mention of being reelected for a third term makes me think of a president who served more than two terms. The obvious example is Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was elected four times, serving from 1933 until his death in 1945. So, the question is probably about FDR's third term.

Now, I should recall the approval ratings around that time. During the 1930s, the country was in the throes of the Great Depression, and later, as World War II started. FDR's leadership was generally well-regarded, especially with his leadership during WWII. However, I'm not exactly sure about the exact approval rating when he decided to run for a third term.

I think that when FDR announced he would run for a third term in 1940, his approval was quite high. The country was still in the Depression, but with the New Deal policies, there was some support. Plus, with the US entering WWII in 1941, his leadership became even more crucial.

Looking at the options, the higher percentages are E (90%), F (50%), G (80%), etc. I remember that FDR's approval ratings were high, especially after the war started. So maybe around 60-70%? But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it was lower because not everyone supported a third term, even if he was popular.

Wait, another angle: sometimes, the question might refer to a more recent president, but I think FDR is the most likely candidate here. Let me think about other presidents who served three terms. There's Grover Cleveland, but that's in the 19th century. So probably FDR.

I think when FDR ran for his third term, his approval was somewhere in the 50-60% range. But I'm not 100% sure. Some sources say that his popularity was high, but I'm not exactly certain of the exact percentage. Alternatively, maybe it was higher because of the war.

Wait, I think during the 1940 election, FDR's approval was over 60%, maybe around 63%. So looking at the options, I see D is 60%. That might be the closest.

Alternatively, I could be mixing up with other presidents. For example, during WWII, when the country was more united, approval ratings were higher. So perhaps in the 80% range, but that might be later on, when the war was going well.

Wait, no, when he announced running for a third term in 1940, the US hadn't entered the war yet. So maybe the approval was around 50-60%. So D (60%) seems plausible.

Another thought: some sources indicate that in the 1940 election, FDR won with about 52% of the popular vote. But that's the vote, not the approval rating. Approval ratings can be different.

Alternatively, maybe the approval was higher because he was leading the country through tough times. So perhaps around 60-70%. Looking at the options, F is 50%, D is 60%, I is 70%, and G is 80%.

I'm leaning towards 60% because that's a commonly cited figure for his approval when he decided to run again. So I think the answer is D: 60%.

The question refers to Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was reelected for a third term as president. At the time he announced his candidacy in 1940, his approval rating was around 60%. This aligns with historical data, as his leadership during the Great Depression and later in World War II was generally well-regarded, though not universally supported. Among the given options, 60% is the most accurate.

Answer: D
