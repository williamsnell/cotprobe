Question:

One afternoon a motorist was driving her car when she struck a pedestrian who entered the intersection. The pedestrian was seriously injured in the accident and sued the motorist to recover damages for personal injuries. There were no witnesses to the accident. The motorist claims that the traffic light was green at the time she entered the intersection. The pedestrian now has amnesia and cannot remember how the accident occurred. At trial, the pedestrian's attorney calls a witness to testify. The witness proposes to testify that she was in the emergency room at the hospital when the pedestrian was brought in following the accident. The witness further testifies that while the pedestrian was being treated for his injuries, the nurse asked him, "How did you get hurt?" The pedestrian replied, "The car ran the red light and struck me as I was walking through the intersection. "Upon objection, this evidence is

Options:

A: admissible as a present sense impression.
B: inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.
C: inadmissible, because the witness was eavesdropping on a confidential communication between the pedestrian and a hospital representative.
D: admissible, as it is a declaration against interest.
E: inadmissible, because it is a statement made after the event.
F: inadmissible, because the pedestrian's response was prompted by the nurse's question.
G: inadmissible, because the pedestrian cannot remember the incident.
H: admissible, as it is a statement of past or present mental, emotional, or physical condition.
I: admissible as a statement under stress or excitement.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence law question. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the scenario is that a motorist hit a pedestrian in an intersection. The pedestrian is seriously injured and sues the motorist. There were no witnesses, which is important. The motorist says the traffic light was green when she entered. The pedestrian has amnesia and can't remember how the accident happened.

At trial, the pedestrian's attorney calls a witness. This witness was in the emergency room when the pedestrian was brought in. She testifies that while the pedestrian was being treated, the nurse asked him, "How did you get hurt?" The pedestrian replied, "The car ran the red light and struck me as I was walking through the intersection." The objection is about whether this evidence is admissible.

The question is about hearsay exceptions. So, first, I need to figure out if this statement is hearsay. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Here, the pedestrian's statement is being offered to show that the car ran the red light, so yes, it's hearsay.

Now, I need to see if any exception applies. Let's look at the options.

Option A: Present sense impression. Present sense impressions allow statements describing an event made while the declarant was perceiving it or immediately thereafter. Here, the statement was made in the ER after the accident, so probably within a short time. But wait, the pedestrian was being treated, so maybe it was under stress. Hmm. But I'm not sure if it qualifies as a present sense impression because the statement is about how he got hurt, which is the event itself.

Option B: Inadmissible because it's hearsay without an exception. If no exception applies, then yes, it's inadmissible. But I need to check other options.

Option C: Inadmissible due to eavesdropping on a confidential communication. I don't think the nurse-patient communication is confidential in this context. Usually, confidential communications are in therapy or similar, but a nurse's question during treatment might not be considered confidential. So maybe C is incorrect.

Option D: Declaration against interest. For this, the statement must be against the declarant's pecuniary or proprietary interest. Here, the pedestrian's statement would incriminate the motorist, which might not directly harm the pedestrian's own interest. So D might not apply because declarations against interest usually involve statements that are against the declarant's own interests, like admitting guilt or liability, which could affect their own legal standing. So D is probably not applicable.

Option E: Inadmissible because it's a statement made after the event. Wait, the statement was made after the event, but that's not a reason to exclude it. Many hearsay exceptions allow statements made after the event, as long as they fit the exception. So E is likely incorrect.

Option F: Inadmissible because the pedestrian's response was prompted by the nurse's question. This relates to whether it's a leading question or whether it's a proper foundation. But I think the issue here is whether the statement is admissible under a hearsay exception, not whether the question was proper. The statement was a spontaneous response, so maybe it's a present sense impression or excited utterance.

Option G: Inadmissible because the pedestrian can't remember. The pedestrian has amnesia, but that affects his ability to testify, not necessarily the admissibility of his prior statement. If the statement is a hearsay exception, it can still be admitted regardless of his current memory.

Option H: Admissible as a statement of past or present mental, emotional, or physical condition. Wait, under FRE 803(3), statements of then-existing mental states can be admitted if they're about the declarant's then state of mind. But here, the statement is about how he got hurt, which is a past event. So I think 803(3) requires the statement to relate to the declarant's then-existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition. If the statement is explaining the event, that might not fit. So H might not apply.

Option I: Admissible as a statement under stress or excitement. The excited utterance exception (FRE 803(2)) applies to statements relating to a startling event made while under the stress of the excitement. The pedestrian was just injured, so the statement was likely made under stress. So this could be an excited utterance.

Wait, but the statement was made in the ER after treatment started. The time frame matters. If the pedestrian was under the stress of the accident, even if a bit later, it might still qualify. So I is a possibility.

So, going back to the options. The statement is offered to prove that the car ran the red light, so it's hearsay. Now, does it fit under any exception?

Option A: Present sense impression. The statement is about the event, made while perceiving it or immediately thereafter. If the ER visit was right after the accident, it could qualify.

Option I: Excited utterance. If the pedestrian was still under stress when he made the statement, it would qualify.

Which one applies here? Both could be possible, but I think excited utterance is more likely because the event was startling, and the statement was made while the declarant was excited.

Wait, but the statement was made during treatment. Sometimes, if the declarant is under medical treatment, the excited utterance exception might not apply because the declarant's mental state might have changed. However, the pedestrian was just injured, so likely still under stress.

Alternatively, present sense impression requires the statement to be made while perceiving the event or immediately thereafter. If he was being treated, perhaps the statement was made a bit after the event, but still within a short time. So both A and I could apply.

But looking at the options, the answer might be either A or I.

Wait, another angle: the pedestrian's statement is being offered by the pedestrian's attorney to support his case. The motorist is the defendant, so the pedestrian is the plaintiff. The statement would help the pedestrian's case by showing that the motorist ran a red light.

But the key point is whether the statement is admissible.

Let me think again: the statement was made in response to a nurse's question. The nurse was treating him, so it's part of the medical context. The statement is about how he got hurt. So, it's a statement made under stress from the accident, so it's an excited utterance.

Therefore, the statement would be admissible under the excited utterance exception, making option I correct.

Wait, but option A says present sense impression. Which one is it?

Alternatively, the statement could be both a present sense impression and an excited utterance. But the options present them as separate choices.

Wait, the question is about the objection. The objection is about the statement's admissibility. The defense is likely objecting on hearsay grounds, and the pedestrian's attorney is arguing an exception applies.

So, the options are about which exception applies.

If it's an excited utterance, then I is correct. If it's a present sense impression, then A is correct.

But which is it? Let me think about the rules.

FRE 803(2) for excited utterance: statement relating to a startling event made while under stress of excitement caused by the event.

FRE 803(1) for present sense impression: statement describing an event made while the declarant is perceiving it or immediately thereafter.

In this case, the pedestrian was just in the ER, so the statement was made after the event but while he was still under the stress of the accident. So it's probably an excited utterance.

Therefore, the statement is admissible under the excited utterance exception, making option I correct.

Wait, but sometimes, in medical settings, the statements made by patients to medical personnel are considered part of the medical diagnosis and treatment, and thus may fall under the exception for statements made for medical diagnosis or treatment (FRE 803(4)). But that exception applies to statements made to a medical professional concerning the condition being treated, for diagnosis or treatment purposes.

In this case, the pedestrian's statement about how he got hurt could be relevant to his treatment, as it might inform the doctors about the accident's nature. So under 803(4), such statements are admissible as they are made for diagnosis or treatment.

But wait, the question is whether the statement is being offered to prove the truth of the matter (the car ran the red light), which would make it hearsay. But under 803(4), statements made for medical diagnosis or treatment are admissible, regardless of their truth, if they are relevant to treatment.

Wait, no. The exception in 803(4) allows the statement to be admitted, but only for the purpose of medical treatment, not for the truth of the matter. Wait, no, actually, 803(4) allows the statement to be admitted for the truth of the matter as well, but only if it was made for diagnosis or treatment purposes.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify.

Under FRE 803(4), a statement is admissible as a statement made for medical diagnosis or treatment if it was made by the patient to a medical professional, and it's offered for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment. The statement can be used to prove the truth of the matter asserted.

In this case, the pedestrian's statement about how he got hurt was made to the nurse, which is a medical professional, and it's relevant to his treatment. So under 803(4), this statement would be admissible as it was made for medical diagnosis or treatment.

Therefore, the statement is admissible under 803(4), making it not hearsay, or if it is, it's covered by an exception.

But looking at the options, I don't see an option about 803(4). The options are A through I, with I being excited utterance.

Wait, let's check the options again. The options are:

A: present sense impression.

B: inadmissible, hearsay no exception.

C: inadmissible, eavesdropping.

D: declaration against interest.

E: inadmissible, statement after event.

F: inadmissible, response prompted.

G: inadmissible, amnesia.

H: statement of mental state.

I: statement under stress.

So, 803(4) isn't listed as an option, so perhaps the intended exception is either A, I, or another.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement is admissible under the present sense impression because it was made while the pedestrian was perceiving the event or immediately afterward.

But in this case, the pedestrian was in the ER, so perhaps a bit after the event, but still within the time frame. So A might apply.

Alternatively, the statement could be considered a statement of present mental state under H, but H requires the statement to relate to the declarant's then state of mind, which this does, but perhaps that's stretching it.

Wait, 803(3) allows statements of the declarant's then existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition. So if the pedestrian was explaining how he got hurt, it's a statement about his perception, which relates to his state of mind (i.e., his understanding of the event). So H could be applicable.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

The statement is about a past event, so it's more about what happened, not his current state. Therefore, H might not apply.

So, going back, the statement is an excited utterance, so I is correct.

Alternatively, it's a present sense impression because it was made while perceiving the event or immediately after.

But present sense impressions are for describing the event as it's happening or right after, so if the pedestrian was in the ER, the statement was likely made within minutes, so it could qualify.

But which exception is broader? I think excited utterance is a better fit here.

Wait, but in the ER, if the pedestrian was under stress, the statement would be an excited utterance. So I think I is the correct answer.

Wait, but another point: the nurse's question was, "How did you get hurt?" The pedestrian's response was a statement explaining the accident. So it's a response to a question, which could make it not a spontaneous statement. But excited utterances can be in response to questions if the declarant is still under the stress.

I think the key here is that the statement was made under the stress of the event, so it's an excited utterance.

Therefore, the correct answer is I: admissible as a statement under stress or excitement.
</think>

The statement made by the pedestrian in the emergency room is being offered to prove that the car ran the red light, making it hearsay. To determine admissibility, it must fit within a recognized hearsay exception. 

Option A considers it a present sense impression, which applies to statements describing an event made while perceiving it or immediately thereafter. However, the pedestrian was in the ER, so the statement was made after the event, though still within a short time. 

Option I considers it an excited utterance under the stress of the event. Since the pedestrian was injured and likely under stress, this exception applies, as the statement was made in response to a startling event while still under its influence.

Other options, such as declarations against interest (D) or statements of mental condition (H), do not fit as well. The statement is best classified as an excited utterance, making it admissible under Option I.

Answer: I
