Okay, so I need to solve this problem about the Jones House Furnishings Store's invoice from Howard Hardware Company. Let's read the question carefully.

The invoice date is August 3. The list price is $165.06. There's an 8% discount and a 5% discount applied, bringing the net price to $144.27. The payment terms are (3/10) and (n/60). So, the first part (a) asks how much Jones will pay if they pay on August 12. Part (b) is the payment if made on August 14.

First, I need to understand the payment terms. (3/10, n/60) means that if the payment is made within 10 days, a 3% discount is applied. If not paid within 10 days, the remaining balance is due in 60 days with no further discount. So, the discount periods are 3% for the first 10 days, and if paid after that, no discount beyond the initial ones.

Wait, but wait. The net price is already after discounts of 8% and 5%. So, does that mean the $144.27 is the amount after both discounts? So, the payment terms are applied on top of that? Or is the 3/10 discount applied before or after those discounts? Hmm, I need to clarify.

Looking at the invoice, it says "Less 8% and 5% 20.79 $144.27". So, the discounts of 8% and 5% have already been applied to the list price, resulting in the net price of $144.27. Now, the payment terms are (3/10, n/60), which is a cash discount on the net amount due.

So, the $144.27 is the amount before any cash discount. If they pay within 10 days, they get an additional 3% discount on $144.27. If they pay after 10 days but within 60, they pay the full $144.27.

Now, the question is about when they pay. Part (a) is August 12. Let's see how many days that is from August 3. August 3 to August 12 is 9 days. So, 9 days after August 3. Wait, because August 3 is day 0, so August 4 is day 1, up to August 12, which is day 9. So that's within the 10-day period. Therefore, they qualify for the 3% discount.

So, the amount to pay would be $144.27 minus 3% of that.

Let me calculate that. 3% of 144.27 is 0.03 * 144.27 = 4.3281. So, subtracting that from 144.27 gives 144.27 - 4.3281 = 139.9419, which is approximately $139.94.

Now, part (b) is if they pay on August 14. Let's count the days from August 3. August 3 is day 0, so August 4 is day 1, August 5 day 2, ..., August 14 is day 11. Wait, wait, August has 31 days. So from August 3 to August 14 is 11 days later. So that's more than 10 days. Therefore, they don't get the 3% discount. They have to pay the net amount of $144.27.

Wait, but wait another second. The payment terms are (3/10, n/60). So, the 3% discount is for payment within 10 days. If they pay after 10 days, they pay the full amount, but perhaps there's an additional term for n/60, which is net 60 days. So, in that case, the total due is $144.27, and no further discount applies beyond that.

So, part (a) is $139.94 (after 3% discount), and part (b) is $144.27 (no discount).

Now, looking at the options:

A: $140.27 and $144.27
B: $140.27 and $145.94
C: $134.94 and $144.27
D: $139.94 and $145.94
E: $134.94 and $139.94
F: $134.94 and $140.27
G: $144.27 and $144.27
H: $144.27 and $149.94
I: $139.94 and $144.27
J: $139.94 and $140.27

So, for part (a), we have $139.94, and part (b) is $144.27. Looking at the options, option I and option J have the first part as $139.94. Let's check:

Option I: $139.94 and $144.27 → that's what we have. So, part (a) is 139.94, part (b) is 144.27.

Option J: $139.94 and $140.27 → No, because part (b) is after 10 days, so no discount, so 144.27.

Wait, but wait again. Did I miscalculate the days? Let me double-check the payment dates.

Invoice date is August 3. So, August 3 is day 0.

- August 12: From August 3 to August 12 is 9 days later. So, within the 10-day period, so 3% discount applies.

- August 14: From August 3, that's 11 days later. So, beyond the 10 days, no discount.

So, yes, part (a) is 139.94, part (b) is 144.27. So, the correct option is I.

The Jones House Furnishings Store paid $139.94 if they paid on August 12 (within the 10-day discount period) and $144.27 if they paid on August 14 (after the discount period).
