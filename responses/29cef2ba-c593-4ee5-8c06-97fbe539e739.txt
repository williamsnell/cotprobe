Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about finding the length of a meter stick that's moving at a certain speed. Hmm, I remember something about length contraction in relativity. Let me think.

The problem says the original length, L_0, is 1 meter. The speed given is 2.7 × 10^8 meters per second. Wait, that's pretty fast. I think the speed of light is about 3 × 10^8 m/s, so this speed is 90% of the speed of light. That should definitely be within the realm where relativistic effects matter.

So, length contraction in special relativity is given by the formula L = L_0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Right, because as an object moves closer to the speed of light, its length in the direction of motion contracts from the perspective of a stationary observer.

Let me plug in the numbers. First, I need to find v²/c². The speed v is 2.7e8 m/s, and c is 3e8 m/s. So v/c is 2.7/3, which is 0.9. Squaring that gives (0.9)^2 = 0.81. So 1 - 0.81 = 0.19.

Wait, no, I think I messed that up. The formula is 1 - (v²/c²), so that's 1 - (0.9)^2. 0.9 squared is 0.81, so 1 minus 0.81 is 0.19. Then I take the square root of that. The square root of 0.19 is approximately... let's see, sqrt(0.16) is 0.4, sqrt(0.25) is 0.5, so 0.19 is a bit less than 0.44. Maybe around 0.435.

So then L = 1 m * 0.435, which is approximately 0.435 meters. Looking at the options, option F is 0.44m. That seems close enough. Let me double-check my steps.

Wait, did I calculate v²/c² correctly? v is 2.7e8, c is 3e8. So v/c is 0.9. Squared is 0.81. So 1-0.81 is 0.19. Square root of 0.19 is indeed about 0.435. So 1 m multiplied by that gives ~0.435m, which rounds to 0.44m. So option F is correct.

The length contraction formula in special relativity is used to calculate the observed length of an object moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light. The formula is:

\[ L = L_0 \times \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \]

Given:
- \( L_0 = 1 \, \text{m} \) (rest length of the meter stick)
- \( v = 2.7 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of the meter stick)
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light)

First, calculate the ratio \( \frac{v}{c} \):
\[ \frac{v}{c} = \frac{2.7 \times 10^8}{3 \times 10^8} = 0.9 \]

Next, compute \( \frac{v^2}{c^2} \):
\[ \frac{v^2}{c^2} = (0.9)^2 = 0.81 \]

Then, find \( 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \):
\[ 1 - 0.81 = 0.19 \]

Take the square root of this value:
\[ \sqrt{0.19} \approx 0.435 \]

Finally, calculate the contracted length:
\[ L = 1 \, \text{m} \times 0.435 \approx 0.435 \, \text{m} \]

Rounding to two decimal places, the contracted length is approximately \( 0.44 \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to option F.

Answer: F
