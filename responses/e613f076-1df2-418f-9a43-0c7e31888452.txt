Alright, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says that a scientist measures the total resistance of the wire on a bobbin and finds it to be 5.18 ohms. Then he cuts off a 200-cm length and measures the resistance of that piece, which is 0.35 ohms. The question is asking for the initial length of the wire on the bobbin. The options are given from A to J, with several thousand centimeters as the possible lengths.

Okay, so I remember that resistance in a wire depends on a few factors: the length of the wire, its cross-sectional area, and the resistivity of the material. The formula for resistance is R = ρ * (L/A), where ρ is resistivity, L is length, and A is the cross-sectional area. 

Since the wire is insulated, I'm assuming the cross-sectional area (A) is uniform throughout, right? So when he cuts off a portion of the wire, the cross-sectional area remains the same, only the length changes. That means the ratio of resistances should be the same as the ratio of lengths because the area cancels out.

So the initial resistance R1 is 5.18 ohms, and after cutting off 200 cm, the remaining wire has a resistance R2. But wait, wait. Wait a minute. Or is it that the 200 cm he cut off has a resistance of 0.35 ohms? Let me recheck the problem. Yes, he cuts off 200 cm and measures that piece's resistance as 0.35 ohms. So that 200 cm has R = 0.35 ohms.

Wait, so the initial total wire has R1 = 5.18 ohms. Then he removes 200 cm, which has R2 = 0.35 ohms. So the remaining wire on the bobbin would have a resistance of R1 - R2, which is 5.18 - 0.35 = 4.83 ohms, right? But wait, no, that's not correct. Because the resistances are in series, so the total resistance is the sum of the parts. But when he cuts off 200 cm, that part's resistance is 0.35 ohms, so the remaining part's resistance should be the initial resistance minus that.

Wait, no. Wait, no, that's not right. Because if the total resistance was 5.18 ohms, and he removes 200 cm which has 0.35 ohms, then the remaining wire's resistance would be 5.18 - 0.35 = 4.83 ohms. But that doesn't make sense because the remaining wire is longer than the cut-off part. Wait, no, wait. Actually, when you cut off a part, the remaining part is shorter, so its resistance should be less than the original. Hmm, but in this case, the cut-off part is 200 cm with 0.35 ohms, so the remaining wire would have a higher resistance than the cut-off part. Wait, no, the initial wire is longer, so it's R1 = 5.18 ohms. After cutting off a 200 cm piece with R2 =0.35, the remaining wire's resistance would be R1 - R2 = 5.18 - 0.35 = 4.83 ohms? But that doesn't make sense because the remaining part is shorter than the initial. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, if you have a longer wire, its resistance is higher. So if the initial wire has R1 =5.18, and you cut off a part, the remaining part's resistance would be R1 - R2 =5.18 -0.35 =4.83, which is less than R1, meaning the remaining wire is shorter. But that can't be right because if you cut off 200 cm, the remaining should be longer, right? Wait, no, no. Wait, no, wait. No, no. Wait, if you cut off a 200 cm piece, the remaining wire is the initial length minus 200 cm. So the remaining wire is shorter by 200 cm. So the remaining wire's resistance should be less than the initial resistance because it's shorter. But in that case, R_remaining = 5.18 -0.35 =4.83 ohms. Hmm, but that seems possible, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the ratio of resistances to lengths. Since the wire's cross-sectional area is constant, the resistance is directly proportional to the length. So R1 is proportional to L1, and R2 is proportional to L2. So R1 / R2 = L1 / L2.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The initial wire has a resistance R1 =5.18 ohms, and the cut-off piece has L2 =200 cm and R2=0.35 ohms. So the ratio R1/R2 = L1/L2. So 5.18 / 0.35 = L1 / 200 cm. Let me compute that.

5.18 divided by 0.35. Let me calculate that. 0.35 times 14 is 4.9, which is close to 5.18. So 0.35 *14.8 = 5.18. Because 0.35 *14=4.9, 0.35 *0.8=0.28, so 4.9+0.28=5.18. So 5.18/0.35=14.8. So 14.8 = L1 / 200 cm. So L1 =14.8 *200 cm. Let's compute that. 14 *200=2800, 0.8*200=160, so total 2800+160=2960 cm. So L1 would be 2960 cm, which is option J.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up what's what. Because the cut-off piece is 200 cm with R2=0.35. So the initial wire is L1, which is longer than L2, so R1 should be greater than R2. So R1/R2 = L1/L2. So yes, 5.18 /0.35 = L1/200. So L1= (5.18 /0.35)*200 = 14.8 *200=2960 cm, which is option J.

So the initial length was 2960 cm. That matches option J.

The problem involves determining the initial length of wire on a bobbin based on resistance measurements. Using the relationship between resistance and length, the calculation shows the initial length is 2960 cm.
