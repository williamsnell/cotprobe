Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the net price of this bed that's originally $300. It's being discounted twice: first by 30%, then by 20%. Hmm, I think I remember that when you have multiple discounts, you apply them one after the other. But wait, sometimes people get confused whether you add the discounts or apply them successively. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the original price is $300. The first discount is 30%. So I need to calculate 30% of $300. To find 30%, I can multiply 300 by 0.3, which is 300 * 0.3 = $90. So the discount is $90. Subtracting that from the original price, the price after the first discount is $300 - $90 = $210. Okay, that's straightforward.

Now, the second discount is 20%, but I think this is applied to the already discounted price, right? So I take the $210 and apply a 20% discount. Let me calculate 20% of 210. That's 210 * 0.2 = $42. So the second discount is $42. Subtracting that from $210 gives $210 - $42 = $168. 

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure if I should apply the discounts in a different way. Like, sometimes people might think of adding the discounts together. So 30% + 20% is 50%, and then take 50% off $300. That would be $150. But I don't think that's correct because discounts are usually applied sequentially, not cumulatively. So the first discount brings it down to $210, and then the second discount takes off 20% of that new price, not the original. 

Let me double-check the math. First discount: 30% of 300 is 90, so 300 - 90 is 210. Second discount: 20% of 210 is 42, so 210 - 42 is 168. Yeah, that seems right. So the final price after both discounts is $168. Looking at the options, G is $168. So I think that's the correct answer.

Wait, but another way to calculate it could be to multiply the discounts together. So 30% off is the same as 70% of the original price, and 20% off is 80% of the already discounted price. So you can multiply 0.7 * 0.8 = 0.56, and then 300 * 0.56 = 168. Yeah, that confirms it. So the net price is definitely $168.

The net price is calculated by applying the discounts successively. First, a 30% discount reduces the price to $210, then a 20% discount brings it down to $168.
