Question:

B: 0.55, 0.75 or 75%
C: 0.50, 0.50 or 50%
D: 0.60, 0.70 or 70%
E: 0.64, 0.53 or 53%

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem about moths. Hmm, the question says that in a polluted area, 87% of the Biston betularia moths are melanic, which are dark colored. The frequency of the recessive allele is 0.13, and I need to find two things: the frequency of the dominant allele and the proportion of the dark moths that are heterozygous. 

Wait, let me think. So, in genetics, when we talk about allele frequencies, I remember that the sum of all allele frequencies in a population should equal 1. Let's denote the dominant allele as 'A' and the recessive as 'a'. So, the recessive allele frequency is given as q = 0.13. Since there are only two alleles, the dominant frequency p would be 1 - q, right? So p = 1 - 0.13 = 0.87. Wait, but wait a minute. The question says 87% of the moths are melanic, which is dark, so maybe that's the phenotype frequency. Oh, wait, but the recessive allele is for the light color, so perhaps the dark color is dominant. So, in that case, the dark moths would be either AA or Aa. 

So, the frequency of the dominant phenotype (melanic) is 87%, which is 0.87. The recessive phenotype (light) is 13%, which is 0.13. But the question gives the frequency of the recessive allele as 0.13, not the phenotype. So I think I might be mixing up allele frequency and phenotype frequency. 

Wait, no, the question states the frequency of the recessive allele is 0.13. So q = 0.13. Then p, the dominant allele, is 1 - q = 0.87. But wait, that's the allele frequency. Now, the phenotypic frequency depends on the Hardy-Weinberg equation. So the frequency of the dominant phenotype (dark) would be p² + 2pq. The recessive phenotype is q². 

Wait, but the question says that 87% of the moths are melanic (dark), which would be the dominant phenotype. So according to the data, the dominant phenotype frequency is 0.87, which equals p² + 2pq. But since p = 0.87 (from q=0.13), let's plug that into the equation. 

Wait, wait, that can't be right because if p is 0.87, then p² is 0.7569, and 2pq is 2*(0.87)*(0.13) = 2*0.1131=0.2262. So the total dominant phenotype would be 0.7569 + 0.2262 = 0.9831, which is about 98.3%. But the question says only 87% are dark. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So I must have made a mistake in my approach. 

Wait, perhaps I confused the allele frequencies. Maybe the 0.13 is the frequency of the recessive phenotype, not the allele. Let me read the question again. Oh no, the question says the frequency of the recessives is 0.13. Wait, but in genetics, when someone refers to the frequency of the recessive, they usually mean the allele. So q = 0.13, so p = 0.87. 

But then why is the dominant phenotype only 87%? Because according to H-W, with p=0.87, q=0.13, the dominant phenotype should be p² + 2pq = (0.87)^2 + 2*(0.87)*(0.13). Let me calculate that. 0.87 squared is 0.7569. 2pq is 2*0.87*0.13 = 0.2262. Adding them gives 0.7569 + 0.2262 = 0.9831, which is about 98.3%, but the question says 87% are dark. So that can't be right. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. 

Wait, maybe the 87% is the frequency of the dominant phenotype, but the allele frequencies are different. Let me think again. Let's denote the dominant allele as A and recessive as a. The recessive phenotype is aa, so its frequency is q². The dominant phenotype is AA and Aa, which is p² + 2pq. 

Given that q² = 0.13, because the recessive phenotype is 13% (since 87% are dominant). So q² = 0.13 → q = sqrt(0.13) ≈ 0.3606. Then p = 1 - q ≈ 1 - 0.3606 = 0.6394. 

So the dominant allele frequency p is approximately 0.64. Then, the dominant phenotype frequency is p² + 2pq. Let's compute that. p² = (0.6394)^2 ≈ 0.4089. 2pq = 2*(0.6394)*(0.3606) ≈ 2*0.2296 ≈ 0.4592. So total dominant phenotype is 0.4089 + 0.4592 ≈ 0.8681, which is about 86.8%, close to 87%. That makes sense. So p is approximately 0.64. 

Now, the first part of the question is asking for the frequency of the dominant allele, which is p ≈ 0.64. Looking at the options, option E is 0.64, 0.53 or 53%. So the first number matches. 

The second part is to find the proportion of the dark moths (dominant phenotype) that are heterozygous. The heterozygotes are Aa, which have a frequency of 2pq. So 2pq = 2*(0.6394)*(0.3606) ≈ 0.4592. The total dominant phenotype is 0.8681. So the proportion of heterozygous dark moths is (2pq) / (p² + 2pq) = 0.4592 / 0.8681 ≈ 0.53, or 53%. 

So the first value is 0.64 and the second is 53%, which matches option E. So the answer should be E.
