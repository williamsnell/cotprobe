Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about estimating the pressure exerted by 8.2 lb of CO in a 1-ft³ container at -78°F using three different equations: the ideal-gas equation, the van der Waals equation, and the Redlich-Kwong equation. The options given are from A to J, each providing three pressure values corresponding to these three equations.

First, I need to recall the ideal-gas law, which is PV = nRT. But wait, I also remember that the ideal gas law assumes that the gas molecules are point particles with no volume and that there are no intermolecular forces. So, it's a good starting point, but it might not be very accurate for real gases, especially under conditions where the gas isn't ideal.

Next, the van der Waals equation is an improvement over the ideal gas law. It accounts for the volume of the gas molecules and the intermolecular forces. The equation is (P + a(n²/V²))(V/n - b) = RT. Here, 'a' and 'b' are constants specific to each gas. For CO, I think I need to find these constants.

Then there's the Redlich-Kwong equation, which is another equation of state. It's written as P = (RT)/(V - b) - a/(sqrt(T)V²). This one is more accurate for gases at higher temperatures compared to van der Waals, I believe.

Wait, the temperature given is -78°F. I should convert that to Rankine or Kelvin because gas laws use absolute temperatures. Let me think: to convert Fahrenheit to Rankine, I can add 459.67. So, -78°F + 459.67 = 381.67 °R. Alternatively, in Celsius, -78°F is about -55.56°C, and adding 273.15 gives 217.59 K. But since the ideal gas law uses absolute temperature, Rankine is appropriate here.

Now, the amount of substance is given in pounds. I need to convert that to moles because the equations use n in terms of moles. The molecular weight of CO is approximately 28.01 g/mol. Wait, 8.2 lb is pounds, so let me convert that to grams. 1 lb is about 453.592 grams, so 8.2 lb * 453.592 g/lb = let's see, 8 * 453.592 is 3628.736, plus 0.2 * 453.592 = 90.7184, totaling approximately 3719.454 grams.

So, moles (n) = mass / molecular weight = 3719.454 g / 28.01 g/mol ≈ 132.76 moles. Hmm, that's a lot of moles. Wait, maybe I should double-check that. Let me see: 8.2 lb is 8.2 * 453.592 = let me calculate. 8 * 453.592 is 3628.736, 0.2 * 453.592 is 90.7184, so total is 3719.454 grams. Divided by 28.01 gives 3719.454 / 28.01 ≈ 132.76 moles. Yep, that seems right.

Next, the volume is given as 1 ft³. I need to convert that to cubic meters because the gas constants R are usually in terms of m³, atm, etc. 1 ft is 0.3048 meters, so 1 ft³ is (0.3048)^3 ≈ 0.0283168 m³. Alternatively, in liters, 1 ft³ is about 28.3168 liters. But when using the ideal gas law with R in L·atm/(mol·K), it's easier to work in liters.

Wait, let me check the units for R. The R value I remember is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). Alternatively, in terms of m³ and Pa, but maybe using R=8.314 J/(mol·K) is another option, but I think using the R value in L·atm is easier here.

So, for the ideal gas law, P = nRT/V. Let's plug in the numbers. n is approximately 132.76 mol, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), T is 217.59 K, and V is 28.3168 L.

Calculating P:
P = (132.76 mol * 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) * 217.59 K) / 28.3168 L

Let me compute the numerator first: 132.76 * 0.0821 ≈ 10.87. Then 10.87 * 217.59 ≈ 2363.8. Then divide by 28.3168: 2363.8 / 28.3168 ≈ 83.45 atm. Wait, but looking at the options, none of the ideal gas results are around 83 atm. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the conversion from lb to grams. Let me recalculate. 8.2 lb is 8.2 * 453.592 g. 8 * 453.592 is 3628.736, 0.2 * 453.592 is 90.7184, so total is 3719.454 grams. Divided by 28.01 g/mol gives 3719.454 / 28.01 ≈ 132.76 mol. That seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the temperature conversion again. -78°F to Rankine: 459.67 - 78 = 381.67 °R. So in Rankine, T is 381.67. But if I use R in terms of °R, then R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·°R). So, P = nRT/V.

Wait, but sometimes R is given as 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), so if I use T in K, I should use R as such. Alternatively, if using °R, it's the same as K multiplied by 5/9, but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate using °R. Let me try that approach. T = 381.67 °R. R in those units is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·°R). So P = (132.76 * 0.0821 * 381.67) / 28.3168.

Calculating numerator: 132.76 * 0.0821 ≈ 10.87. 10.87 * 381.67 ≈ 4148. Then divide by 28.3168: 4148 / 28.3168 ≈ 146.4 atm. Hmm, that's still not matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the ideal gas law might not give a very accurate result here, especially since CO is a real gas, and at low temperatures, the ideal behavior breaks down. So maybe the van der Waals equation would give a lower pressure than the ideal gas, as it accounts for molecular volume and attractions. Similarly, the Redlich-Kwong might also adjust the pressure.

But let me think again about the ideal gas calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in the units. Alternatively, perhaps I should use R in different units. Let me try using R = 10.73 L·psi/(mol·°R). Because sometimes pressure is in psi, and that might make sense.

So R = 10.73 L·psi/(mol·°R). Then P = nRT/V in psi.

n = 132.76 mol, R=10.73, T=381.67 °R, V=28.3168 L.

So P = (132.76 * 10.73 * 381.67) / 28.3168.

Calculating numerator: 132.76 * 10.73 ≈ 1425. Then 1425 * 381.67 ≈ let me approximate. 1425 * 380 ≈ 542, 1425 * 1.67 ≈ 2375. So total ≈ 542,000 + 2375 = 544,375? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, 132.76 *10.73= approx 1425. Then 1425 *381.67 = let me compute more accurately.

1425 * 381.67 = let's break it down:

1425 * 300 = 427,500

1425 * 80 = 114,000

1425 * 1.67 ≈ 1425 *1.6 = 2280, and 1425 *0.07=100. So total ≈ 2280+100=2380.

Adding up: 427,500 + 114,000 = 541,500 + 2,380 = 543,880.

Now, divide by 28.3168 L: 543,880 /28.3168 ≈ let's see, 543,880 ÷ 28 ≈ 19,424 psi. That's way too high. But wait, the options are in psia, like 1000 psia, etc. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, maybe I should not use R in psi but instead use R in terms that give me atm. Let me go back to R = 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

So, T in K is 217.59 K.

n = 132.76 mol, R=0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), V=28.3168 L.

P = (132.76 * 0.0821 * 217.59) / 28.3168.

Calculating numerator: 132.76 *0.0821 ≈ 10.87. 10.87 *217.59 ≈ 2363.8.

Divide by 28.3168: 2363.8 /28.3168 ≈ 83.45 atm.

Looking at the options, the ideal gas results are the first value in each option. Let's see which option has the ideal gas close to 83.45 atm. Looking at the options:

A: 1500psia = 102atm (ideal?), 88.9, 92.4

B: 1000psia=68, 58.8, 62.5

C: 850=57.8,50,53.1

D:1400=95.2,82.3,85

E:900=60.9,70.5,75.8

F:800=54.4,47.6,50.2

G:1600=108.9,94.5,98.6

H:1200=81.7,68.2,70.8

I:1300=88.2,75.6,80.9

J:1100=75.1,65.7,68.5

Wait, none of the ideal gas values (first number in each option) are around 83.45 atm. The closest is option H, which has 81.7 atm as the first value. But that's still a bit off. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the R value. R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), correct. T is 217.59 K. n is 132.76 mol. V is 28.3168 L.

So P = (132.76 * 0.0821 * 217.59) /28.3168.

Let me compute each step again.

132.76 *0.0821 = let me compute 132 *0.0821 = 10.8682, and 0.76 *0.0821 ≈0.0623, so total ≈ 10.93 atm·L/(mol·K) * mol = 10.93 atm·L/K.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), so when multiplied by n (mol) and T (K), it gives L·atm.

So 132.76 * 0.0821 = let's compute: 130 *0.0821=10.673, 2.76 *0.0821≈0.226, total ≈10.899 L·atm.

Then multiply by T=217.59 K: 10.899 *217.59 ≈ approx 2364 L·atm.

Divide by V=28.3168 L: 2364 /28.3168 ≈83.45 atm.

So the ideal gas pressure is about 83.45 atm, which is approximately 83.5 atm. Looking at the options, none have that as their first value. The closest is option H, which starts with 81.7 atm.

But maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using R as 8.314 J/(mol·K). Wait, but that would require pressure in Pascals, which might not align with the options given.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the molecular weight again. CO is carbon monoxide, whose molecular weight is indeed about 28.01 g/mol. So 8.2 lb is 3719.454 g, which gives 132.76 mol. That seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the pressure is expressed in psia, not in atm. Wait, no, the options show both psia and atm. For example, option A says 1500psia = 102.0atm. So 1500 psi is about 102 atm, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the real gas equations now. Let's try the van der Waals equation next.

The van der Waals equation is (P + a(n/V)^2) * (V/n - b) = RT.

First, I need the constants a and b for CO. I think for CO, a is about 0.206 (in L²·atm/mol²) and b is about 0.0396 (in L/mol). Wait, I'm not entirely sure; perhaps I should look up the van der Waals constants for CO. Alternatively, maybe I can recall that for CO, a is around 0.206 L²·atm/mol², and b is 0.0396 L/mol.

So, let me proceed with these values.

n =132.76 mol, V=28.3168 L.

Compute n/V = 132.76 /28.3168 ≈4.687 mol/L.

Compute (n/V)^2 = (4.687)^2 ≈21.96 (mol²/L²).

So, a*(n/V)^2 = 0.206 *21.96 ≈4.524 L·atm/mol² * (mol²/L²) → the units would be L·atm/mol. Wait, no, the units for a are L²·atm/mol², so when multiplied by (mol/L)^2, it becomes L²·atm/mol² * mol²/L² = atm. So, a*(n/V)^2 ≈4.524 atm.

Next, compute V/n - b. V=28.3168 L, n=132.76 mol. So V/n =28.3168 /132.76 ≈0.2134 L/mol. Subtract b: 0.2134 -0.0396 ≈0.1738 L/mol.

Now, the van der Waals equation: (P + a*(n/V)^2) * (V/n -b) = RT.

We have P +4.524 atm ≈ RT/(V/n -b) = (0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) *217.59 K) /0.1738 L/mol.

Compute numerator: 0.0821 *217.59 ≈17.93 L·atm/mol.

Divide by 0.1738 L/mol: 17.93 /0.1738 ≈103.14 atm.

So, P +4.524 ≈103.14. Therefore, P ≈103.14 -4.524 ≈98.61 atm.

Wait, but that can't be right, because the ideal gas gave us about 83.45 atm, and the van der Waals should give a lower pressure, considering the molecules' volume and attraction. But 98.61 atm is higher than the ideal gas value, which doesn't make sense. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units for a and b. Let me check: a is in L²·atm/mol², and b is in L/mol. Yes, that's correct. So the calculation should be right. But why is the van der Waals pressure higher than the ideal gas? That suggests that the correction terms are making the pressure higher, which doesn't make sense because at low temperatures, real gases are more likely to deviate towards higher pressures when considering the molecular volume (since molecules take up space, making the pressure lower than ideal) and attractive forces (which lower pressure, but if the equation is subtracting that, perhaps the pressure is lower than ideal).

Wait, maybe I got the equation wrong. Let me write it again: (P + a(n²/V²))(V/n - b) = RT.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate (P + a(n/V)^2) correctly. Wait, n/V is 4.687 mol/L, so (n/V)^2 is 21.96 (mol²/L²). Multiply by a=0.206 L²·atm/mol²: 0.206 *21.96 ≈4.524 atm. So that part is correct.

Then, (V/n -b) =0.2134 -0.0396=0.1738 L/mol.

So, RT is 0.0821 *217.59 ≈17.93 L·atm/mol.

Then, 17.93 /0.1738 ≈103.14 atm. So P +4.524 =103.14 → P=98.61 atm.

Hmm, but this is higher than the ideal gas value. That suggests that the van der Waals equation is giving a higher pressure than ideal, which contradicts what I know about gases. Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong constants. Let me check the van der Waals constants for CO again. Maybe I got them wrong.

Upon checking, I think the correct van der Waals constants for CO are a=0.206 L²·atm/mol² and b=0.0396 L/mol. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that at low temperatures, the van der Waals equation's first correction term (a) dominates, leading to a higher pressure than ideal. But that doesn't align with typical behavior. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, maybe I should proceed to calculate the Redlich-Kwong equation and see if that gives a better result, but the time is limited, so perhaps I should look for the option where the ideal gas is around 83 atm, van der Waals a bit higher, and Redlich-Kwong perhaps even lower.

Looking at the options, option I has 88.2 atm as the first value, which is close to our van der Waals result of about 98.61 atm, but that's not matching. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use the correct units for the van der Waals equation. Let me try recalculating.

Wait, another approach: let me compute each part again.

n=132.76 mol, V=28.3168 L.

n/V = 132.76 /28.3168 ≈4.687 mol/L.

a=0.206 L²·atm/(mol²), so a*(n/V)^2 =0.206*(4.687)^2=0.206*21.96≈4.524 atm.

b=0.0396 L/mol.

V/n =28.3168/132.76≈0.2134 L/mol.

So, V/n - b=0.2134 -0.0396=0.1738 L/mol.

RT=0.0821 *217.59≈17.93 L·atm/mol.

So, (P +4.524) *0.1738=17.93 → P +4.524=17.93/0.1738≈103.14 → P=103.14-4.524=98.616 atm.

Hmm, so the van der Waals pressure is about 98.6 atm. Looking at the options, the second value in each option is the van der Waals. Let's see which option has the van der Waals close to 98.6 atm. None of the options have a second value that high. The highest in the options is option G's second value at 94.5 atm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the van der Waals equation uses (n/V)² or (n²/V²). Wait, the equation is (P + a(n/V)^2)(V/n -b)=RT. So yes, it's (n/V)^2.

Alternatively, perhaps the van der Waals constants are different. Let me check another source. Upon checking, I find that for CO, a=0.206 L²·atm/mol² and b=0.0396 L/mol, which is correct. So the calculation seems right, but the result doesn't match any option. Maybe the options are using different constants or perhaps the problem expects an approximate calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to round the numbers. Let's say the van der Waals pressure is approximately 98.6 atm. Looking at the options, the second value (van der Waals) in option G is 94.5, which is close but not exact. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the van der Waals equation isn't the best fit here, especially if the temperature is low enough that the equation's accuracy is questionable.

Now, moving on to the Redlich-Kwong equation: P = (RT)/(V - b) - a/(sqrt(T)V²).

First, I need the Redlich-Kwong constants a and b for CO. I think for CO, a is around 4.597 (in L·atm/(mol²·K^0.5)) and b is 0.0542 L/mol. Alternatively, I might have these values mixed up. Let me verify. Upon checking, I find that the Redlich-Kwong constants for CO are a=4.597 L·atm/(mol²·K^0.5) and b=0.0542 L/mol.

So, let's plug in the numbers.

n=132.76 mol, V=28.3168 L.

Compute V - b =28.3168 -0.0542≈28.2626 L.

Compute sqrt(T)=sqrt(217.59)≈14.75 K^0.5.

Compute a/(sqrt(T)V²) =4.597 / (14.75 * (28.3168)^2).

First, compute V²: (28.3168)^2≈801.8 L².

Then, 14.75 *801.8≈11826.85.

So, a/(sqrt(T)V²)=4.597 /11826.85≈0.0003886 L·atm/(mol²·K^0.5) * (mol²·K^0.5)/(L²·atm)) → Wait, no, the units would cancel out, leaving atm.

So, 4.597 /11826.85 ≈0.0003886 atm.

Then, RT=0.0821 *217.59≈17.93 L·atm/mol.

So, P = (17.93)/(28.2626) - 0.0003886 ≈0.6346 atm.

Wait, that can't be right because the pressure should be higher than the ideal gas law. But 0.63 atm is way too low. I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor. Let me check the equation again: P = (RT)/(V - b) - a/(sqrt(T)V²).

Wait, but I think I forgot that the units for a might require a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute each term step by step.

Compute (RT)/(V - b): RT=17.93 L·atm/mol. V - b=28.2626 L.

So, 17.93 /28.2626 ≈0.6346 atm.

Then, a/(sqrt(T)V²) =4.597 / (14.75 * (28.3168)^2).

Wait, (28.3168)^2=801.8, so 14.75 *801.8≈11826.85.

4.597 /11826.85≈0.0003886 atm.

So, P=0.6346 -0.0003886≈0.6342 atm. That's way too low. But that can't be right because the ideal gas law gave us 83 atm, so the Redlich-Kwong should give a value closer to that but adjusted.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units for a. Let me check the units for the Redlich-Kwong equation. The a constant in the Redlich-Kwong equation is in units of L·atm/(mol²·K^0.5). So when I compute a/(sqrt(T)V²), the units should be (L·atm/(mol²·K^0.5)) / (K^0.5 * L²) )= (L·atm/(mol²·K^0.5)) * (mol²·K^0.5)/(L²·atm)) → which simplifies to 1/L. Wait, that doesn't make sense. I think I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to compute a/(sqrt(T)V²) as (a / V²) / sqrt(T). Let me compute a/(V²) first.

a=4.597 L·atm/(mol²·K^0.5).

V=28.3168 L, so V²=801.8 L².

a/(V²)=4.597 /801.8≈0.005733 L·atm/(mol²·K^0.5) / L² = 0.005733 L·atm/(mol²·K^0.5·L²) = 0.005733 atm/(mol²·K^0.5·L).

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it as (a)/(sqrt(T) * V²).

sqrt(T)=14.75 K^0.5.

So, a/(sqrt(T) * V²) =4.597 / (14.75 * 801.8) =4.597 /11826.85≈0.0003886 atm.

So, P = (RT)/(V -b) - a/(sqrt(T)V²) =0.6346 -0.0003886≈0.6342 atm, which is way too low. This suggests I made a mistake in the calculation or in the constants.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the correct a and b values. Let me check another source. I think I might have mixed up the a and b constants for Redlich-Kwong. Upon checking, for CO, a=4.597 L·atm/(mol²·K^0.5) and b=0.0542 L/mol. So that part is correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should compute the second term differently. Let me try again.

a/(sqrt(T)V²) =4.597 / (14.75 * (28.3168)^2).

Compute denominator:14.75 * (28.3168)^2 =14.75 * 801.8 ≈11826.85.

So, 4.597 /11826.85≈0.0003886 atm.

Thus, P=0.6346 -0.0003886≈0.6342 atm, which is way too low. This can't be right because the ideal gas pressure is much higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units for R. Let me check R again. R=0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). So when I compute RT=0.0821 *217.59≈17.93 L·atm/mol. That seems correct.

Wait, maybe the Redlich-Kwong equation isn't applicable at such low temperatures. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that at low temperatures, the Redlich-Kwong equation might not be as accurate, leading to a less reliable result.

Given that, perhaps I should focus on the options and see which one aligns best with the ideal gas law value of around 83.5 atm, van der Waals around 98.6 atm, and Redlich-Kwong around 0.63 atm, but that last part doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Redlich-Kwong calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use the correct formula for the Redlich-Kwong equation. Let me recheck: P = (RT)/(V - b) - a/(sqrt(T)V²). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each term correctly. Let me compute (RT)/(V - b):

RT=17.93 L·atm/mol.

V - b=28.3168 -0.0542=28.2626 L.

So, 17.93 /28.2626≈0.6346 atm.

Then, a/(sqrt(T)V²)=4.597/(14.75 * (28.3168)^2)=4.597/(14.75 *801.8)=4.597/11826.85≈0.0003886 atm.

So, P=0.6346 -0.0003886≈0.6342 atm. That's way too low, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I made a mistake in the constants or the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use different units. Let me try using R in terms of J/(mol·K). R=8.314 J/(mol·K). Then, pressure in Pascals.

But that might complicate things further. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the Redlich-Kwong equation isn't suitable for very low temperatures, and thus, the pressure calculated via it is not reliable here.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps I should look for the option where the first value (ideal gas) is close to 83.5 atm, the second (van der Waals) is around 98.6, and the third (Redlich-Kwong) is perhaps lower than ideal. But looking at the options, none have such values.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that I might have made a mistake in the van der Waals calculation leading to a higher pressure than ideal, which isn't possible. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem expects me to use the ideal gas equation and then select the option where the first value is close to 83.5 atm. From the options, option H has 81.7 atm as the first value, which is the closest. Then, the van der Waals would be the second value, which in option H is 68.2 atm, which is lower than ideal, which makes sense because at low temperatures, the van der Waals pressure should be lower than ideal. But wait, earlier I calculated van der Waals as 98.6, which was higher than ideal, which contradicts. So perhaps I made a mistake in the van der Waals calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the van der Waals equation gives a lower pressure than ideal because the molecules attract each other, which would lower the pressure. So, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation earlier.

Let me try the van der Waals calculation again, perhaps I messed up the signs.

The van der Waals equation is (P + a(n/V)^2)(V/n -b) = RT.

We have P + a(n/V)^2 = RT/(V/n -b).

So, P = RT/(V/n -b) - a(n/V)^2.

Wait, that's different from what I did earlier. Let me recalculate.

n=132.76 mol, V=28.3168 L.

n/V=4.687 mol/L.

a=0.206 L²·atm/mol².

So, a(n/V)^2 =0.206*(4.687)^2=0.206*21.96≈4.524 atm.

V/n=28.3168/132.76≈0.2134 L/mol.

b=0.0396 L/mol.

So, V/n -b=0.2134 -0.0396=0.1738 L/mol.

RT=0.0821 *217.59≈17.93 L·atm/mol.

So, RT/(V/n -b)=17.93 /0.1738≈103.14 atm.

Then, P=103.14 -4.524≈98.62 atm.

Wait, that's the same result as before, which is higher than ideal. That still doesn't make sense. So perhaps the van der Waals pressure is higher than ideal, which suggests that the gas is behaving more like an ideal gas than expected, but that's unlikely at such a low temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that CO is a polar gas and might have different constants. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed to look at the options again.

Looking back, the ideal gas pressure I calculated is around 83.5 atm. The options don't have a first value that close. The closest is option H with 81.7 atm. So, perhaps option H is the one where the ideal gas is 81.7, van der Waals is 68.2, and Redlich-Kwong is 70.8. But wait, that would suggest that the van der Waals pressure is lower than ideal, which aligns more with what I expect because at low temperatures, the attractive forces dominate, leading to lower pressure than ideal.

But according to my calculation, van der Waals gave a higher pressure, which contradicts this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the van der Waals calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the units again. Wait, perhaps I should use the van der Waals equation in terms of pressure in psia. Let me try that.

Wait, but that complicates things further. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different approach, like using the ideal gas law and then adjusting for real gas behavior.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, I think the best approach is to look for the option where the ideal gas is around 83 atm, van der Waals is lower, and Redlich-Kwong is perhaps in between. But the options don't seem to match this.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option H: 1200psia=81.7 atm (ideal), 68.2 atm (van der Waals), 70.8 atm (Redlich-Kwong). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should select option A, which has 1500psia=102 atm, but that seems too high.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the units again. The problem states the pressure in psia and atm. So, 1500 psia is about 102 atm, which is higher than my ideal gas calculation. So perhaps option A isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the ideal gas pressure is around 83.5 atm, which is about 850 psia (since 1 atm≈14.696 psi, so 83.5 atm *14.696≈1228 psi). Looking at the options, option F is 800psia=54.4 atm, which doesn't match. Option H is 1200psia=81.7 atm, which is very close to my ideal gas calculation of 83.5 atm. So option H's first value is 81.7 atm, which is close to my ideal gas result.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option H: 1200psia=81.7 atm (ideal), 68.2 atm (van der Waals), 70.8 atm (Redlich-Kwong).

The problem involves estimating the pressure exerted by 8.2 lb of CO in a 1-ft³ container at -78°F using the ideal-gas equation, the van der Waals equation, and the Redlich-Kwong equation. The calculations proceed as follows:

1. **Ideal-Gas Equation**:  
   Using the ideal-gas law \( PV = nRT \), the pressure was calculated to be approximately \( 83.5 \, \text{atm} \). This value corresponds closely to the first value in option H (\( 81.7 \, \text{atm} \)).

2. **Van der Waals Equation**:  
   The van der Waals equation \( (P + a(n/V)^2)(V/n - b) = RT \) was applied with CO's constants \( a = 0.206 \, \text{L}^2 \cdot \text{atm/mol}^2 \) and \( b = 0.0396 \, \text{L/mol} \). The calculated pressure was approximately \( 98.6 \, \text{atm} \), which is higher than the ideal-gas result. However, none of the options match this value closely.

3. **Redlich-Kwong Equation**:  
   The Redlich-Kwong equation \( P = \frac{RT}{V - b} - \frac{a}{\sqrt{T}V^2} \) was used with CO's constants \( a = 4.597 \, \text{L} \cdot \text{atm/(mol}^2 \cdot \text{K}^{0.5}) \) and \( b = 0.0542 \, \text{L/mol} \). The calculated pressure was unreasonably low (\( 0.63 \, \text{atm} \)), suggesting a potential issue with the calculation or the equation's applicability at such low temperatures.

Given the ideal-gas result (\( 83.5 \, \text{atm} \)) and the closest matching option, the most plausible answer is **option H**, where the ideal-gas pressure is \( 81.7 \, \text{atm} \), the van der Waals pressure is \( 68.2 \, \text{atm} \), and the Redlich-Kwong pressure is \( 70.8 \, \text{atm} \).
