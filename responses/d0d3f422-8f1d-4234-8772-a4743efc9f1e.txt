Question:

One of the methods for the synthesis of dilute acetic acid from ethanol is the use ofacetobacter. A dilute solution of ethanol is allowed to trickle down overbeechwoodshavings that have been inoculated with a culture of the bacteria. Air is forced through the vat countercurrent to the alcohol flow. The reaction can be written as C_2H_5OH (aq) + O_2 CH_3COOH (aq) + H_2O (l) acetic acid Calculate the Gibbs Free Energy, ∆G°, for this reaction, given the following Gibbs Free Energies of Formation: Ethanol = - 43.39 Kcal/mole, H_2O (l) = - 56.69 Kcal/mole, and Acetic acid = - 95.38 Kcal/mole.

Options:

A: - 89.1 Kcal/mole
B: - 65.5 Kcal/mole
C: - 120.5 Kcal/mole
D: - 20.3 Kcal/mole
E: - 150.9 Kcal/mole
F: - 56.69 Kcal/mole
G: - 108.7 Kcal/mole
H: - 95.38 Kcal/mole
I: - 78.2 Kcal/mole
J: - 43.39 Kcal/mole

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the Gibbs Free Energy change for a reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The reaction given is the oxidation of ethanol to acetic acid. The equation is C₂H₅OH (aq) + O₂ → CH₃COOH (aq) + H₂O (l). I remember that Gibbs Free Energy change (ΔG°) can be calculated using the formula: ΔG° = Σ ΔGf°(products) - Σ ΔGf°(reactants). Right, because ΔGf° is the standard Gibbs free energy of formation for each substance.

Wait, so I need to find the ΔG° for each product and subtract the sum of the ΔG° for each reactant. The data provided are the Gibbs energies of formation for ethanol, water, and acetic acid. Oh, and O₂ is O2 gas, right? I think the standard Gibbs free energy of formation for elements in their standard state, like O₂ gas, is zero. Yeah, that's right. So I don't need to worry about O₂ in the calculation.

Let me list out the given values:
- Ethanol (C₂H₅OH): -43.39 kcal/mol
- Water (H₂O, liquid): -56.69 kcal/mol
- Acetic acid (CH₃COOH): -95.38 kcal/mol

The reaction has one mole of ethanol, one mole of O₂, producing one mole of acetic acid and one mole of water. So, the products are acetic acid and water, each with their ΔGf° values. The reactants are ethanol and O₂, again, each one mole.

So, plugging into the formula: ΔG° = [ΔGf°(CH₃COOH) + ΔGf°(H₂O)] - [ΔGf°(C₂H₅OH) + ΔGf°(O₂)].

But since ΔGf°(O₂) is zero, it simplifies. So, ΔG° = [(-95.38) + (-56.69)] - [(-43.39) + 0].

Let me compute that. First, sum the products: -95.38 + (-56.69) = -152.07 kcal/mol. Then sum the reactants: -43.39 + 0 = -43.39 kcal/mol.

Now subtract: (-152.07) - (-43.39) = -152.07 + 43.39. Let's do the math. 152.07 minus 43.39 is 108.68, but since both are negative, the result is negative. So 152.07 - 43.39 = 108.68, so negative 108.68. Wait, wait, wait: no, wait. The calculation is [sum products] minus [sum reactants]. So products sum is -152.07, reactants sum is -43.39. So it's (-152.07) - (-43.39) = -152.07 + 43.39 = -108.68 kcal/mol.

Looking at the options, I see option G is -108.7 kcal/mol. That's very close. So the correct answer should be G. But wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Products: (-95.38) + (-56.69) = -152.07. Reactants: (-43.39) + 0 = -43.39. So ΔG° = (-152.07) - (-43.39) = (-152.07) +43.39 = -108.68, which rounds to -108.7. Yep, that's correct. So the answer is G.

To calculate the Gibbs Free Energy change (ΔG°) for the reaction:

C₂H₅OH (aq) + O₂ → CH₃COOH (aq) + H₂O (l),

we use the formula:

ΔG° = Σ ΔGf°(products) - Σ ΔGf°(reactants).

Given the standard Gibbs free energies of formation:
- Ethanol (C₂H₅OH): -43.39 kcal/mol,
- Water (H₂O, liquid): -56.69 kcal/mol,
- Acetic acid (CH₃COOH): -95.38 kcal/mol,
- Oxygen (O₂, gas): 0 kcal/mol (since it's in its standard state),

we calculate:

ΔG° = [(-95.38) + (-56.69)] - [(-43.39) + 0].

Simplifying:
ΔG° = (-152.07) - (-43.39) = (-152.07) + 43.39 = -108.68 kcal/mol.

Rounding to one decimal place, ΔG° = -108.7 kcal/mol.

Thus, the correct answer is:

G
