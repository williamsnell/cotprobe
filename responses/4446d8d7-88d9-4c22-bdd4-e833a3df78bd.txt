Alright, so I have this problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the domain of the function f(x) = (x + 6) divided by the square root of (x² - 3x - 4). Hmm, okay. I remember that the domain of a function includes all the real numbers x for which the function is defined. So, I need to look for any restrictions that would make this function undefined.

First off, the function is a fraction, so the denominator can't be zero because division by zero is undefined. Also, since there's a square root in the denominator, the expression inside the square root must be positive because you can't take the square root of a negative number in real numbers, and also, the denominator can't be zero.

So, let me break this down. The denominator is sqrt(x² - 3x - 4). For the square root to be defined, the expression inside must be greater than zero. So I need to solve the inequality x² - 3x - 4 > 0.

To solve this quadratic inequality, I think I should first find the roots of the quadratic equation x² - 3x - 4 = 0. I can use the quadratic formula: x = [3 ± sqrt(9 + 16)] / 2. Wait, because the quadratic is x² -3x -4, so a=1, b=-3, c=-4. Plugging into the formula: x = [3 ± sqrt( (-3)^2 - 4*1*(-4) )]/(2*1) = [3 ± sqrt(9 +16)]/2 = [3 ± sqrt(25)]/2. Since sqrt(25) is 5, that simplifies to [3 ±5]/2.

So, the two roots are (3 +5)/2 = 8/2 = 4, and (3-5)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1. So the roots are x = -1 and x = 4.

Now, the quadratic x² -3x -4 can be factored as (x - 4)(x + 1), right? Because when you expand (x -4)(x +1), you get x² +x -4x -4 = x² -3x -4, which matches.

So, the inequality is (x -4)(x +1) > 0. To find where this product is positive, I can consider the intervals determined by the roots, which are x < -1, between -1 and 4, and x >4.

I'll test each interval:

1. When x < -1, let's pick x = -2. Plugging into (x-4)(x+1): (-2 -4)= -6, (-2 +1)= -1. Multiply: (-6)*(-1)=6, which is positive. So this interval satisfies the inequality.

2. Between -1 and 4, let's pick x=0. (0-4)= -4, (0+1)=1. Multiply: (-4)(1)=-4, which is negative. So this interval doesn't satisfy the inequality.

3. When x >4, let's pick x=5. (5-4)=1, (5+1)=6. Multiply: 1*6=6, positive. So this interval satisfies the inequality.

Therefore, the solution to x² -3x -4 >0 is x < -1 or x >4. So the domain of f(x) is all real numbers x where x is less than -1 or greater than 4.

Now, looking at the options, I need to see which one matches (-infty, -1) union (4, infty). Let me check the options:

Option H is (-inf, -1) U (4, inf), which matches exactly. So the answer should be H.

The function is defined when the denominator is positive and non-zero. Solving the inequality for the denominator, we find the domain is (-∞, -1) ∪ (4, ∞).

Answer: H
