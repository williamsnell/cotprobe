Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the electric field intensity midway between two point charges. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my electromagnetism, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem states that there are two charges: charge 1 is +30 microcoulombs, and charge 2 is +40 microcoulombs. They're placed 10 cm apart in air, and I need to find the electric field at the midpoint. The answer options are given in terms of newtons per coulomb, so I think I need to compute the field in that unit.

First, I remember that the electric field due to a point charge is given by Coulomb's Law: E = kQ / r², where k is Coulomb's constant, Q is the charge, and r is the distance from the charge to the point where the field is being calculated.

Since the charges are 10 cm apart, the midpoint would be 5 cm from each charge. Wait, but wait, 5 cm is 0.05 meters, right? Because in physics, we usually work in meters, kilograms, and seconds (SI units). So I should convert centimeters to meters. That's 0.05 m.

Both charges are positive, so their electric fields at the midpoint will point away from each charge. But since both are on opposite sides of the midpoint, their fields will be in the same direction, I think. Because each charge is positive, the field from charge 1 will point away from it, which would be to the right if charge 1 is on the left, and the field from charge 2 (also positive) will point away from it, which would be to the left. Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, if charge 1 is on the left and charge 2 on the right, the midpoint is in between. So the field from charge 1 at the midpoint points towards the right (since it's positive, field emanates outward), and the field from charge 2 at the midpoint also points to the left (since it's positive, field emanates outward). Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, if charge 1 is on the left, the field at the midpoint due to charge 1 would point to the right because positive charges emit fields outward. Similarly, charge 2 on the right would have a field at the midpoint pointing to the left. Oh wait, that would mean the fields are in opposite directions. Wait, but that can't be right because both charges are positive and the midpoint is between them. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, no. Wait, each positive charge creates an electric field that points away from itself. So if I'm at the midpoint between two positive charges, the field from each charge would point away from that charge. So charge 1 is on the left, so its field at the midpoint points to the right. Charge 2 is on the right, so its field at the midpoint points to the left. So the two fields would be in opposite directions. So I need to calculate each field and then add them as vectors. But wait, wait, actually, since both are positive, their fields at the midpoint would be in opposite directions. So when adding, I have to subtract their magnitudes if they're in opposite directions. Or wait, no, wait—if both fields are pointing in opposite directions, their contributions would subtract. But wait, let me make sure. Let me imagine: charge 1 is on the left, charge 2 on the right. The midpoint is in the middle. The field from charge 1 at midpoint is to the right (because it's positive and field emanates away from it). The field from charge 2 at midpoint is to the left (since it's positive, field emanates away, so from charge 2 on the right, the field at midpoint points left). So the two fields are in opposite directions. Therefore, the total field would be the difference between the two fields. But wait, which one is stronger?

Wait, but wait, let's get the calculations right. Let me compute each field first.

Coulomb's constant, k, is approximately 8.988×10^9 N·m²/C². But sometimes it's approximated as 9×10^9 for simplicity, especially in exams.

So for charge 1: Q1 = 30 microcoulombs. Micro is 10^-6, so Q1 = 30e-6 C. The distance r from charge 1 to the midpoint is 0.05 m.

So E1 = k * Q1 / r² = (9e9 N·m²/C²) * (30e-6 C) / (0.05 m)^2.

Let me compute that step by step. First, 0.05 squared is 0.0025 m².

So E1 = 9e9 * 30e-6 / 0.0025.

Compute numerator: 9e9 * 30e-6 = 9 * 30 * 1e9 * 1e-6 = 270 * 1e3 = 270,000 N·m²/C.

Wait, wait, 1e9 * 1e-6 is 1e3, so 9e9 *30e-6 = 9*30 * 1e3 = 270 * 1e3 = 270,000.

Then, 270,000 divided by 0.0025.

Hmm, 0.0025 is 2.5e-3, so 270,000 / 0.0025 = 270,000 / 2.5e-3.

Let me compute 270,000 / 0.0025.

Well, 0.0025 × 100,000 = 250. So 270,000 is 270,000 / 250 = 1080 times 0.0025. Wait, perhaps I should compute it differently.

Alternatively, 270,000 / 0.0025 = (270,000 * 100000) ) / 2500.

Wait, perhaps I can compute it as 270,000 / 0.0025 = 270,000 * (1 / 0.0025) = 270,000 * 400, because 1/0.0025 is 400.

So 270,000 * 400 = 270,000 * 4 * 100 = 1,080,000 * 100 = 108,000,000 N/C. Wait, that seems high. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps an easier way: 9e9 * 30e-6 = 270,000, as before. Then divide by 0.05^2 = 0.0025.

270,000 / 0.0025 = (270,000 * 10000) ) / 25 = (2,700,000,000) /25 = 108,000,000 N/C. Wait, that's 1.08e8 N/C. Hmm, but looking at the options, the highest is 60e6, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait a second. 30 microcoulombs is 30e-6 C, correct. 0.05 m is correct.

Wait, let me recalculate E1.

E1 = (9e9) * (30e-6) / (0.05)^2.

Compute numerator: 9e9 *30e-6 = 9 * 30 = 270, and 1e9 * 1e-6 = 1e3. So 270 * 1e3 = 270,000.

Denominator: 0.05^2 = 0.0025.

So 270,000 / 0.0025 = ?

Let me compute 0.0025 × 100,000 = 250. So 0.0025 × 108,000 = 270. So 108,000 * 0.0025 = 270. So 270,000 / 0.0025 = 108,000 * 1000? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, 270,000 is 270,000. Let me compute 270,000 / 0.0025.

Wait, 0.0025 is 2.5e-3. So 270,000 / 2.5e-3 = (270,000 / 2.5) * 1e3.

270,000 / 2.5 = 108,000. Then multiply by 1e3 → 108,000,000 → 1.08e8 N/C.

But that's way higher than the options given, which are up to 60e6. Hmm, perhaps I messed up the exponents.

Wait, maybe I should calculate using exponents properly.

Let me compute 9e9 * 30e-6 = 9e9 * 3e-5 = (9*3) * 1e(9-5) )= 27 * 1e4 = 270,000.

Then, 270,000 / (0.05^2) = 270,000 / 0.0025 = 108,000,000 N/C.

Wait, but the options don't go that high. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, the problem says the charges are 10 cm apart, so the midpoint is 5 cm from each charge, which is 0.05 m, correct. So that part is right.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the exponents. Let me try another approach. Let me compute E1 again.

E1 = (9 x 10^9 N·m²/C²) * (30 x 10^-6 C) / (0.05 m)^2.

Compute numerator: 9e9 *30e-6 = 9 *30 = 270, and 10^9 *10^-6 =10^3, so 270 *1e3 = 270,000.

Denominator: 0.05^2 = 0.0025.

So E1 = 270,000 / 0.0025 = 108,000,000 N/C → 1.08e8 N/C.

Wait, that's 108 million N/C. But looking at the options, the highest is 60e6 (option C). So I must have made a mistake.

Wait a second, perhaps I'm supposed to add the fields from both charges, but considering their directions. Wait, but both charges are positive, so the fields at the midpoint would be in opposite directions. So the net field would be the difference between the two.

Wait, let me compute E1 and E2.

E1 is due to Q1, which is +30μC at 0.05 m away. E2 is due to Q2, which is +40μC at 0.05 m away.

So E1 = k*30e-6 / (0.05)^2 = same as before, 1.08e8 N/C to the right.

E2 = k*40e-6 / (0.05)^2.

So E2 = (9e9) * (40e-6) / 0.0025.

Compute numerator: 9e9 *40e-6 = 9 *40 = 360, and 1e9 *1e-6=1e3, so 360*1e3=360,000.

Divide by 0.0025: 360,000 / 0.0025 = 144,000,000 N/C → 1.44e8 N/C.

But since E1 is 1.08e8 to the right and E2 is 1.44e8 to the left, the net field is E_net = E2 - E1 (since E2 is larger), because both are in opposite directions.

So E_net = 1.44e8 - 1.08e8 = 0.36e8 → 3.6e7 N/C → 36 × 10^6 N/C.

Wait, that matches option E: 36 ×10^6 N/C.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute each field correctly.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using microcoulombs as 1e-6, so Q1=30e-6 C, Q2=40e-6 C.

The distance r=0.05 m.

E1 = (8.988e9) * (30e-6) / (0.05)^2.

Compute 30e-6 *8.988e9 → 30e-6 * 9e9 ≈ 270,000 as before.

Divide by 0.0025 → 108,000,000 N/C.

E2 = (8.988e9) * (40e-6) / 0.0025.

40e-6 *9e9 = 360,000.

360,000 /0.0025= 144,000,000 N/C.

So E_net = E2 (left) - E1 (right) → 144e6 - 108e6 = 36e6 N/C.

So the field is 36 ×10^6 N/C, which is option E.

To determine the electric field intensity midway between two point charges, we use Coulomb's Law:  
\[
E = \frac{kQ}{r^2}
\]  
where \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \), \( Q \) is the charge, and \( r \) is the distance from the charge to the point of interest.

### Step 1: Convert units
- The charges are \( Q_1 = +30 \, \mu\text{C} = 30 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{C} \) and \( Q_2 = +40 \, \mu\text{C} = 40 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{C} \).
- The distance between the charges is \( 10 \, \text{cm} = 0.1 \, \text{m} \), so the midpoint is \( r = 0.05 \, \text{m} \) from each charge.

### Step 2: Calculate the electric field due to each charge
The electric field at the midpoint due to \( Q_1 \):  
\[
E_1 = \frac{k Q_1}{r^2} = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9)(30 \times 10^{-6})}{(0.05)^2}
\]  
\[
E_1 = \frac{270,000}{0.0025} = 108,000,000 \, \text{N/C}
\]  

The electric field at the midpoint due to \( Q_2 \):  
\[
E_2 = \frac{k Q_2}{r^2} = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9)(40 \times 10^{-6})}{(0.05)^2}
\]  
\[
E_2 = \frac{360,000}{0.0025} = 144,000,000 \, \text{N/C}
\]  

### Step 3: Determine the net electric field
Since both charges are positive, their electric fields at the midpoint point in opposite directions. The net electric field is the difference between the two fields:  
\[
E_{\text{net}} = E_2 - E_1 = 144,000,000 - 108,000,000 = 36,000,000 \, \text{N/C}
\]  

Thus, the electric field intensity midway between the charges is:  
\[
\boxed{36 \times 10^6 \, \text{N/C}}
\]  

### Final Answer:
E
