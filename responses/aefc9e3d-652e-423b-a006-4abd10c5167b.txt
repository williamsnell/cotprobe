Okay, so I've got this question about information theory and graph theory concepts. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question has two statements, and I need to evaluate each one. The options are from A to J, each combining a True/False or other possibilities for each statement.

**Statement 1:** For any two variables x and y with joint distribution p(x,y), H[x,y] ≥ H[x] + H[y], where H is the entropy function.

Hmm, I remember that entropy has some properties. The entropy of the joint distribution H(x,y) is always less than or equal to the sum of the individual entropies H(x) + H(y). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Wait, no, actually, I think the entropy of the joint is less than or equal to the sum because H(x,y) = H(x) + H(y) - I(x;y), where I is the mutual information. Since mutual information is non-negative, H(x,y) ≤ H(x) + H(y). So statement 1 says the opposite, that it's greater than or equal. So statement 1 is false.

**Statement 2:** For some directed graphs, moralization decreases the number of edges present in the graph.

Moralization is a process in graph theory where you make a directed graph undirected by adding edges. Specifically, if you have two nodes A and B with a common child C, you add an edge between A and B. So, in directed graphs, moralization can add edges but doesn't remove any existing ones. Wait, does it ever decrease the number of edges? I'm trying to think. No, because you're only adding edges, not removing any. So the number of edges can only stay the same or increase. So for some directed graphs, moralization would not decrease edges. But statement 2 says "for some" graphs, moralization decreases edges. Wait, no, because in reality, it can't decrease. So statement 2 is false.

Wait, but wait. Maybe I'm confusing something. Let me think again. No, the process of moralization involves adding edges, not removing. So the number of edges can't decrease. So statement 2 is false because moralization doesn't decrease edges; it can only add them or leave them as is.

Wait, but the statement says "for some directed graphs, moralization decreases the number of edges." So if it's impossible for moralization to decrease edges, then the statement is false. Because for no directed graphs does moralization decrease edges. So statement 2 is false.

Wait, but maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again. Suppose you have a graph where some edges are already present. When you moralize, you add edges where parents of a common child aren't connected. So you can't lose edges, only add. So the number of edges can't decrease. So the statement 2 is false because it's impossible for moralization to decrease edges. So statement 2 is false.

So now, evaluating the two statements:

Statement 1: False
Statement 2: False

Looking at the options, which option has both statements as False? Let's check the options.

Option F: False, False. That's for both statements being false.

Wait, but let me make sure. The first statement is definitely about H(x,y) being greater than or equal to H(x) + H(y), which is wrong. So statement 1 is false.

Statement 2 is about moralization decreasing edges. Since it's impossible, statement 2 is also false. So both statements are false, so the correct option is F: False, False.
</think>

The first statement is false because the entropy of the joint distribution is always less than or equal to the sum of the individual entropies. The second statement is false because moralization cannot decrease the number of edges in a directed graph; it can only add or maintain them.

Answer: F
