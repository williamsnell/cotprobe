Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about test construction and evaluation, specifically about what validity refers to. I'm a bit rusty on my psychometrics, but I'll try to work through it.

First, the question is asking about the definition of validity in the context of tests. I remember that validity is one of the key concepts in testing, along with reliability. Validity has to do with whether a test measures what it's supposed to measure. So, it's about the accuracy of the test in assessing the intended construct.

Looking at the options:

A: Includes a diverse range of question types. Hmm, that sounds more like a consideration for a good test, maybe related to content validity, but I think content validity is a type of validity, not the overall definition. Maybe this is more about the test's structure rather than its validity per se.

B: Has been piloted and statistically analyzed. While pilot testing and statistical analysis are important steps in ensuring validity, they are methods used to assess or improve validity, not what validity itself refers to. So this is a process, not the definition.

C: Yields consistent results on successive administrations. That's more about reliability, right? Reliability is about consistency over time, so this isn't validity.

D: Has questions that are closely related to each other. This seems related to internal consistency, which is a type of reliability. Also, if all questions are too similar, it might affect the test's breadth but not necessarily its validity unless it's targeting a specific construct.

E: Can be completed within a reasonable time frame. That's more about test practicality or feasibility, not about what the test measures.

F: Includes norms based on a representative sample. Norms are important for interpretation, but validity is about whether the test measures the intended construct, not just having good norms.

G: Is applicable to a wide range of individuals. That's about the test's applicability or fairness across different groups, which relates to validity in terms of whether it's measuring the construct for everyone, but I'm not sure if that's the primary definition.

H: Is easy for the test taker to understand. That's about clarity and perhaps test design, but again, not the core definition of validity.

I: Measures what it purports to measure. This sounds exactly like the definition of validity I remember. It's the essence of validityâ€”the test's alignment with its intended purpose.

J: Has been approved by a recognized testing body. That's more about external validation or accreditation, which is a step in ensuring quality but not the definition of validity itself.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be option I. It directly states that validity refers to the test measuring what it's supposed to measure, which aligns with the concept of validity in psychometrics.

Validity refers to the degree to which a test measures what it is intended to measure. Among the options, the correct answer is:

I: measures what it purports to measure

The answer is I.
