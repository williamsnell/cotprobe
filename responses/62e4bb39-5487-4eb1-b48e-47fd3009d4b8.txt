Question:

Mr. Fields is considering selling a property acquired 15 years ago for $65,000; $10,000 was for the land, and $55,000 was for the building. Mr. Fields can now sell the property for $120,000. He can also keep it and continue to collect the annual rent from the building. If Mr. Fields decides to keep the property, he will keep it for another 25 years and will, at that time, sell it for $40,000. The annual rent receipts will be $5,930 for the next twenty-five years. Should Mr. Fields sell the property now or in twenty-five years? Assume that the building, but not the land, has been depreciated using the straight line method at 2%, long term gains are taxable at a rate of 25%, Mr. Fields' income tax rate is 56%, the minimum attractive rate of return after taxes is 2(1/2)%, and taxes will hold for the next 25 years. Make all calculations to the nearest dollar.

Options:

A: Mr. Fields should lease the property to a new tenant for a higher annual rent
B: Mr. Fields should sell the property now for $120,000
C: Mr. Fields should keep the property for 25 more years
D: Mr. Fields should convert the building into a personal residence
E: Mr. Fields should rent the property for another 15 years
F: Mr. Fields should sell the property after 10 years
G: Mr. Fields should renovate the property and then decide whether to sell or keep it
H: Mr. Fields should exchange the property for a similar one to defer taxes
I: Mr. Fields should hold the property indefinitely for future generations
J: Mr. Fields should donate the property to a charitable organization for a tax write-off

Okay, so I need to help Mr. Fields decide whether to sell his property now or hold onto it for another 25 years. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, let's understand the situation. Mr. Fields bought the property 15 years ago for $65,000. Out of that, $10,000 was for the land, and $55,000 for the building. Now, he can sell it for $120,000. Alternatively, he can keep it, collect rent for the next 25 years, and then sell it for $40,000. 

He's thinking about which option is better—selling now or holding for 25 more years. There are a bunch of factors here: depreciation, taxes, his tax rate, and the minimum rate of return he wants.

Let me list out the key points:

1. **Current Sale Option:**
   - Sell now for $120,000.
   - He bought it 15 years ago, so the cost basis is $65,000. But the building has been depreciated using the straight-line method at 2% over 15 years.

2. **Holding Option:**
   - Collect rent for 25 years: $5,930 per year.
   - Then sell for $40,000 after 25 years.
   - The building is depreciated at 2% per year, straight-line.
   - He'll have to consider taxes on the sale both now and in 25 years.

3. **Taxes:**
   - Long-term gains are taxed at 25%.
   - His income tax rate is 56%.
   - He needs a minimum return of 2.5% after taxes.

So, I think I need to calculate the net proceeds from each option, considering taxes and depreciation, and then compare which option gives a better return.

Let's start with the current sale:

**Option B: Sell Now**

- Selling price: $120,000
- Original cost: $65,000

But wait, the building has been depreciated. So, the adjusted basis for the building after 15 years at 2% per year would be:

Depreciation per year = 55,000 / 50 years (since straight line over 50 years is standard for buildings). Wait, but the problem says 2% depreciation. So, 2% of 55,000 is $1,100 per year. Over 15 years, that's 15 * 1,100 = $16,500.

So, the adjusted basis for the building is 55,000 - 16,500 = $38,500. The land's basis remains $10,000 since land isn't depreciated.

Total adjusted basis = 38,500 + 10,000 = $48,500.

So, when he sells for $120,000 now, the gain is 120,000 - 48,500 = $71,500.

This is a long-term gain, taxed at 25%. So taxes owed: 71,500 * 0.25 = $17,875.

Net proceeds after taxes: 120,000 - 17,875 = $102,125.

Alternatively, if he sells now, he gets $102,125.

**Option C: Keep for 25 Years**

He will collect rent each year and then sell for $40,000. Let's calculate the net present value (NPV) of this option.

First, the annual rent is $5,930 for 25 years. Then, the sale is $40,000 after 25 years.

But we need to consider depreciation during these 25 years, as well as taxes. Also, when he sells after 25 years, he'll have a tax on the sale again.

Wait, the building has already been depreciated for 15 years, so the basis is $38,500. Now, if he holds for another 25 years, he can continue depreciating the building. But wait, the building's depreciation period is 50 years, so he's already depreciated 15 years, so 35 years left? Or is it that he can only depreciate it for 25 years from now?

Wait, the problem states that the building has been depreciated using the straight-line method at 2%, so the rate is 2% per year. So, the annual depreciation is 2% of $55,000, which is $1,100 per year.

So, over 25 years, the depreciation would be 25 * 1,100 = $27,500.

But wait, the initial basis was $55,000. After 15 years, it's $38,500. If he continues to depreciate for another 25 years, the total depreciation would be 15*1,100 +25*1,100 = 40*1,100 = $44,000. So the adjusted basis after 25 more years would be 55,000 - 44,000 = $11,000. But wait, that can't be right because the total depreciation over 50 years (the standard period) is $11,000 per year (2% of 55k), so 50 years would be 55,000 - (50*1,100) = 55,000 -55,000 = $0. So after 15 years, 16,500, and after 25 years, 27,500 more, total 44,000. So the basis would be 55,000 -44,000=11,000.

But wait, when he sells after 25 years, he gets $40,000. So the gain would be 40,000 - (land basis + building basis). Land basis is $10,000, and building basis is $11,000, so total basis is $21,000. So the gain is 40,000 -21,000= $19,000.

Taxes on this gain: 19,000 *25% = $4,750.

So the net proceeds from the sale after taxes: 40,000 -4,750= $35,250.

Now, the rent is $5,930 per year for 25 years. But we need to consider the after-tax cash flows each year, and then discount them at 2.5% to find the NPV.

Alternatively, since the taxes on the rent would be part of the cash flow, but the problem doesn't specify any other expenses, so I think we can assume the rent is net of any expenses, but actually, no, wait: the rent is the amount he receives, but he has to pay taxes on that rent each year.

Wait, but the problem says "annual rent receipts will be $5,930." So that's the gross receipts, but he has to pay income tax on that. His tax rate is 56%, so each year's rent would be reduced by 56%.

So, the after-tax rent each year is 5,930*(1-0.56)=5,930*0.44≈$2,609.20.

So, each year he gets $2,609.20 after taxes.

Now, we have 25 annual payments of $2,609.20 each, plus a final payment of $35,250 in year 25.

We need to calculate the NPV of this cash flow at the minimum rate of return of 2.5%.

The formula for NPV is the sum of (cash flow)/(1+r)^t for each year t, plus the final cash flow.

Alternatively, we can compute the present value of the annuity plus the present value of the final sale.

The present value of the rent cash flows is an annuity. The formula for the present value of an annuity is PMT * [1 - (1/(1+r)^n)] / r.

So, PMT is $2,609.20, r=0.025, n=25.

Let me calculate that.

First, compute the present value of the rents:

PV_r = 2,609.20 * [1 - (1/(1.025)^25)] / 0.025.

Compute (1.025)^25 ≈ 1.6386.

So 1/1.6386≈0.6108.

1 - 0.6108 = 0.3892.

Divide by 0.025: 0.3892 /0.025=15.568.

Multiply by 2,609.20: 2,609.20 *15.568≈ let's see, 2,609.20 *15=39,138, 2,609.20 *0.568≈1,484. So total ≈39,138 +1,484≈40,622.

Then, the present value of the final sale is $35,250/(1.025)^25 ≈35,250 /1.6386≈21,522.

So total PV for holding is 40,622 +21,522≈62,144.

Now, compare this to selling now, which gives $102,125.

Wait, that can't be right because 62k is less than 102k. So selling now would give a higher NPV.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the after-tax rent. Let me double-check.

The rent is $5,930 gross. He pays income tax at 56%, so the tax each year is 5,930*0.56≈3,319.80. So after-tax rent is 5,930 -3,319.80≈$2,610.20, which matches my earlier calculation.

So the present value of the holding option is around $62,144, and selling now gives $102,125, which is higher. Therefore, selling now is better.

Wait, but let me check the depreciation again. Because when he holds for 25 years, the building's depreciation continues each year, which affects the basis for the sale. But in the calculation above, I considered the total depreciation over 25 years, but perhaps I should model it each year, but that's complicated. Alternatively, the way I did it is correct because the basis after 25 years is 55,000 - (15+25)*1,100=55,000-44,000=11,000. So the gain is 40,000 - (10,000+11,000)=19,000. Taxes on that are 4,750, so net 35,250.

So, the holding option's PV is about $62k, which is less than selling now for $102k. So, selling now is better.

Wait, but maybe I missed something. Let me check the initial cost basis again.

When he bought the property 15 years ago, he paid $65k. The land is $10k, building $55k. He's been depreciating the building at 2% per year, which is 1,100 per year. So after 15 years, the building's basis is 55k -15*1,100=55k-16.5k=38.5k. Land remains 10k. So total basis is 48.5k.

If he sells now for 120k, the gain is 120k -48.5k=71.5k. Taxes on 71.5k at 25% is 17,875. Net proceeds: 102,125.

If he holds for 25 years, the building depreciates another 25*1,100=27.5k. So building basis becomes 38.5k +27.5k=66k? Wait, no. Wait, the initial basis after 15 years was 38.5k. If he continues to depreciate for 25 years, the building's basis would be 38.5k -25*1,100=38.5k-27.5k=11k. So total basis is 10k (land) +11k (building)=21k.

When he sells for 40k, gain is 40k -21k=19k. Taxes: 4,750. Net proceeds from sale:35,250.

The rent each year is 5,930. After taxes at 56%, it's 5,930*(1-0.56)=2,609.20.

So the cash flows are 25 annual payments of 2,609.20 and a final payment of 35,250.

Calculating the NPV at 2.5%: the PV of the annuity plus the PV of the final amount.

Annuity PV: 2,609.20 * [1 - (1/(1.025)^25)] /0.025.

As before, that's approximately 2,609.20 *15.568≈40,622.

PV of 35,250:35,250 /1.025^25≈21,522.

Total PV≈62,144.

Comparing to selling now:102,125.

So, 102k is better than 62k. So Mr. Fields should sell now.

Wait, but what about the option to keep the property for another 25 years? The calculation shows that selling now gives a higher NPV. Therefore, the correct answer should be B: sell now.
</think>

Mr. Fields should compare the net proceeds from selling the property now versus holding it for another 25 years. Selling now yields $102,125 after taxes, while holding the property results in a net present value of approximately $62,144. Since selling now provides a higher return, the best option is to sell the property now.

**Answer: B**
