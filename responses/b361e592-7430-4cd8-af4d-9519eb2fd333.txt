Question:

Philosophy is concerned primarily with identifying beliefs about human existence and evaluating arguments that support those beliefs.  These activities can be summarized in two questions that drive philosophical investigations:

Options:

A: who really believes X? and how can we explain differences in people's beliefs?
B: what is the origin of thought? and how does it impact our actions?
C: what do you mean? and how do you know?
D: how do beliefs shape society? and why do beliefs differ?
E: how do philosophers argue? and are their differences important?
F: why is there something rather than nothing? and how can we be sure?
G: how can we prove it? and what if we're wrong?
H: why should we bother? and what are the consequences of our believing one thing over another?

Okay, so I have this philosophy question in front of me, and I need to figure out the right answer. The question is about identifying the two main questions that drive philosophical investigations. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question states: "Philosophy is concerned primarily with identifying beliefs about human existence and evaluating arguments that support those beliefs. These activities can be summarized in two questions that drive philosophical investigations."

So, the task is to match this description with one of the given options (A to J). Let me break down the key points. Philosophy deals with beliefs about human existence. That sounds like it's about the big questions of life, like existence itself. Then, evaluating arguments means looking at the reasons and justifications for those beliefs. So the two main questions should probably be about understanding what these beliefs are and how we know they're valid.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Who really believes X? and how can we explain differences in people's beliefs? Hmm, this seems more about the diversity of beliefs and who holds them. Not sure if this is the primary focus on evaluating arguments.

Option B: What is the origin of thought? and how does it impact our actions? This seems more about psychology or the basis of thought, which might not directly tie to evaluating beliefs about existence.

Option C: What do you mean? and how do you know? This seems relevant. The first part is about clarifying concepts, which is a big part of philosophy. The second part is about justification, which ties into evaluating arguments.

Option D: How do beliefs shape society? and why do beliefs differ? Again, more about the impact and diversity of beliefs, not so much about the evaluation of their validity.

Option E: How do philosophers argue? and are their differences important? This is about the methods of argumentation and the significance of differing opinions among philosophers, but I'm not sure if it's the primary questions driving investigations into existence.

Option F: Why is there something rather than nothing? and how can we be sure? The first part is a classic metaphysical question, but the second part is about certainty, which is also a big philosophical topic. However, does this cover the identification and evaluation of beliefs as broadly as another option might?

Option G: How can we prove it? and what if we're wrong? This is about evidence and doubt. The first part is about proof, which relates to evaluating arguments, but the second part is more about skepticism.

Option H: Why should we bother? and what are the consequences of our believing one thing over another? This seems more about the practical implications and motivation, which isn't the primary focus here.

Let me think again. The question mentions identifying beliefs and evaluating arguments. Identifying beliefs would involve understanding what the beliefs are (like "what do you mean?") and evaluating them would involve justifying them ("how do you know?"). So Option C seems to fit this description.

Wait, but let me double-check. Option F's first question is about the origin of existence, which is a deep philosophical question, but the second part is about certainty. Option C's questions are more about clarification and justification, which seems more foundational to philosophical investigation.

Yes, I think Option C is the right choice. It addresses the two main activities: understanding the beliefs (what do you mean) and evaluating the arguments (how do you know).

The correct answer is:

C: what do you mean? and how do you know?

The reasoning is that these questions address the identification and evaluation of beliefs, which are central to philosophical investigations.
