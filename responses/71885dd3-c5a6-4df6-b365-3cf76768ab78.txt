Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it carefully again.

The question is about the probability of a neutron causing fission in a U-238 nucleus. The neutron has an energy of 2.0 MeV, which is typical in fission. The cross-section given is 0.68 barns, and the sample thickness is 3.2 cm. I need to find the probability of fission happening.

Hmm, I remember that cross-sections are a measure of the probability of a particular interaction happening. So the bigger the cross-section, the higher the probability. But wait, how does the thickness of the sample come into play here?

Oh, right! The concept of attenuation. When a neutron passes through a material, the probability of it interacting depends on the thickness of the material and the cross-section. I think the formula involves the exponential decay, like the probability of a neutron not being absorbed as it passes through.

Wait, the formula for the probability of a neutron not being absorbed (survival probability) after passing through a material is P = exp(-nσx), where n is the number of target nuclei per unit volume, σ is the cross-section, and x is the thickness. But wait, in this case, we're dealing with a pure U-238 sample, so n would be the number density of U-238 nuclei.

Wait, but maybe I'm complicating it. Another thought: the probability of interaction (absorption) is given by the product of the cross-section, the number of targets, and the path length. But wait, I think I'm mixing concepts from nuclear reactions and attenuation.

Alternatively, I recall that the probability of a neutron being absorbed can be calculated using the formula P = 1 - exp(-Nσ), where N is the number of target nuclei encountered. But N depends on the number density, the area, or the path length.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the attenuation formula. The probability that a neutron is not absorbed (P_no) after passing through a thickness L is P_no = exp(-L * n * σ), where n is the number of nuclei per unit volume, L is the thickness, and σ is the cross-section.

Wait, but I don't have the number density n here. Hmm, maybe the problem is assuming that the entire sample is made of U-238, so we can model it as a slab. Oh wait, perhaps the problem is using the concept of the 'macroscopic cross-section,' which is the product of the number density (n) and the cross-section (σ). So the macroscopic cross-section Σ is nσ.

Then the probability of a neutron being absorbed (P) is 1 - exp(-Σx), where x is the thickness. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach because without knowing the density, I can't find n. Or maybe the problem is using some typical value for the number of U-238 atoms per cm² or something like that.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is treating the problem as a simple product of the cross-section and the thickness, but that seems unlikely. Oh wait, perhaps the problem is using the concept of the 'fission probability' as the product of the cross-section and the number of nuclei encountered. But again, without density, I'm stuck.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The formula for the probability of a neutron being absorbed is P = 1 - exp(-nσx), where n is the number of target nuclei per unit volume, σ is the cross-section, and x is the thickness. But without knowing n, I can't compute this. Unless the problem is giving the number density implicitly.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the sample is thin enough that the exponential can be approximated by a Taylor expansion. Like, for small x*n*σ, P ≈ nσx. But wait, 3.2 cm is the thickness. Wait, but without knowing n, can I proceed?

Hmm, maybe I should look for another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the concept of the macroscopic cross-section, which is Σ = nσ. Then the probability P is 1 - exp(-Σx). But without knowing n, I can't compute Σ. Unless the problem gives me the number of atoms per unit volume, which it doesn't.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the units. The cross-section is given in barns. 1 barn is 1e-24 cm². So the cross-section σ = 0.68 barns = 0.68e-24 cm².

The thickness x is 3.2 cm. But I still need the number of nuclei per cm³, n. If the sample is pure U-238, then n would be its density divided by the molar mass. But the problem doesn't give the density. Wait, maybe it's assuming a standard density, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the concept of the 'fission probability' as the product of the cross-section and the thickness in some way. Alternatively, maybe it's considering the 'fission probability' as the product of the cross-section and the number of nuclei encountered in the path.

Wait, another thought: the interaction probability P can be approximated as P ≈ 1 - exp(-Nσ), where N is the number of target nuclei per unit area. But without knowing the density, I can't find N.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula P = nσx, assuming that nσx is much less than 1, so the exponential can be approximated as 1 - nσx. But then, without knowing n, how can I find P?

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Wait, perhaps the problem is using the concept of the 'linear attenuation coefficient,' which is μ = nσ. Then the probability of a neutron not being absorbed is exp(-μx). But again, without n, I can't compute μ.

Wait, maybe the problem is simplifying things by using the concept that the probability is roughly the product of the cross-section and the number of targets along the path. So P ≈ Nσ, where N is the number of targets per cm². But how do I find N?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the sample is thin enough that the probability is approximately σ multiplied by the area. Wait, but I'm not making progress here.

Wait, maybe I should look for an alternative formula. I recall that the average number of interactions λ is given by nσx. Then the probability of at least one interaction is P = 1 - exp(-λ). But again, without n, I can't compute λ.

Hmm, I'm stuck because I don't have the number density n. Unless the problem is using a standard value for the number of U-238 atoms per cm² or something like that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the sample is such that nσx is small, so P ≈ nσx.

Wait, but without n, how can I compute P? Maybe I'm missing something here. Let me check the units again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the concept of the 'attenuation coefficient' μ, which is μ = nσ. Then the probability of a neutron not being absorbed is exp(-μx). So the probability of being absorbed is P = 1 - exp(-μx). But again, without n, I can't compute μ.

Wait, maybe the problem is designed such that the probability is simply the product of the cross-section (in barns) and the thickness (in cm), but that doesn't make sense dimensionally. Alternatively, perhaps the cross-section is given per nucleus, and the sample's thickness is such that the number of nuclei along the path is known.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the concept of the 'fission probability' as P = σ * N, where N is the number of nuclei per cm². But without knowing the density or the number of nuclei, I can't compute N.

Wait, I'm missing something. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is using the concept that the probability P is equal to the product of the cross-section (σ) and the number of target nuclei (N) that the neutron encounters. But N would depend on the area and the number density.

Wait, wait a minute. Perhaps the problem is considering that the number of nuclei per unit area (areal density) is given by the thickness times the number density. So N = n * x, where x is the thickness. Then P = 1 - exp(-Nσ) = 1 - exp(-n x σ). But without knowing n, I can't compute this.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using an approximate formula where P ≈ σ * x * n, but without n, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the concept that the probability is the cross-section times the number of targets per unit area. Let me think: the number of targets per unit area would be the number density (n) multiplied by the thickness (x), so N = n x. So the probability P is n x σ. But without n, I can't compute this.

Wait, maybe the problem is giving the cross-section in barns, and the sample is 3.2 cm thick, but I'm supposed to assume a certain number of atoms per cm². Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a standard value for the number of U-238 atoms per cm² in a pure sample. Wait, but I don't recall that value.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the problem is simply asking for the product of the cross-section and the thickness, but normalized somehow. Wait, wait, the cross-section in barns is 0.68e-24 cm², and the thickness is 3.2 cm. So the product would be 0.68e-24 cm² * 3.2 cm = 2.176e-24 cm³. But that doesn't directly give a probability.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the options given. The options are probabilities between 0.05 and 0.9. Let's see: if the cross-section is 0.68 barns, which is quite large, but the sample is 3.2 cm thick. If the probability is high, the neutron is likely to fission quickly. But without knowing the density, I can't compute it.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the concept that the probability is approximately the product of the cross-section (in barns) and the number of nuclei per cm². But again, without the number density, I can't proceed.

Wait, maybe the problem is using a different approach. Let me think about the concept of the 'fission probability' being given by P = (σ / (2.4e-24 cm²)) * x, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula P = (σ * x) / (1e-24 cm² * cm) = σ * x in terms of 1e-24 cm³.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should make an assumption to proceed. Let's say that the number density n is such that n * x is 1, making P = 1 - exp(-σ). But I don't know if that's valid.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the probability is simply the cross-section divided by 1 barn, but that doesn't fit because 0.68 is less than 1, and the options don't match that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the concept that the probability is the cross-section multiplied by the thickness in some unit. Let me compute 0.68 barns * 3.2 cm. But barns are cm², so 0.68e-24 cm² *3.2 cm = 2.176e-24 cm³. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the concept that the probability is (σ * N) where N is the number of nuclei per cm². But without N, I can't compute.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a standard formula. Oh! I think the formula for the probability of a neutron being absorbed (P) after passing through a material of thickness x is:

P = 1 - exp(-Σx)

Where Σ is the total cross-section per unit volume, i.e., Σ = nσ. But without knowing n, the number density, I can't compute Σ.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is assuming that the sample is such that Σx is small, so exp(-Σx) ≈ 1 - Σx. Then P ≈ Σx.

But again, without Σ, which is nσ, I can't proceed.

Wait, maybe the problem is giving the thickness in such a way that the product Σx equals 0.68 * 3.2 = 2.176, but that seems too high, because then P ≈ 1 - exp(-2.176) which is about 0.78, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the concept that the probability is simply the product of the cross-section (in barns) and the thickness in centimeters, but that would give 0.68 *3.2 = 2.176, which is greater than 1, which can't be a probability. So that can't be right.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simplifying and using the formula P = nσx, assuming that nσx is small, so P ≈ nσx. But without n, I can't compute this.

Wait, perhaps I can find n from the density of U-238. The density of U-238 is about 19.05 g/cm³. The molar mass of U-238 is approximately 238 g/mol. So the number density n is (density / molar mass) * Avogadro's number.

So let's compute that.

Density ρ = 19.05 g/cm³
Molar mass M = 238 g/mol
Avogadro's number N_A = 6.022e23 mol⁻¹

n = (ρ / M) * N_A = (19.05 / 238) * 6.022e23 ≈ (0.0798) * 6.022e23 ≈ 4.81e22 nuclei/cm³.

So n ≈ 4.81e22 nuclei/cm³.

Now, the thickness x is 3.2 cm.

So the product nσx would be:

n = 4.81e22 cm⁻³
σ = 0.68 barns = 0.68e-24 cm²
x = 3.2 cm

So nσx = 4.81e22 * 0.68e-24 *3.2

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 4.81e22 * 0.68e-24 = 4.81 * 0.68 * 1e-2 = (3.2728) * 1e-2 = 0.032728.

Then multiply by 3.2 cm:

0.032728 *3.2 ≈ 0.1047.

So nσx ≈ 0.1047.

Since 0.1047 is much less than 1, the exponential term can be approximated as exp(-0.1047) ≈ 1 - 0.1047 + 0.0055 ≈ 0.896.

Therefore, the probability of absorption P is 1 - 0.896 ≈ 0.104, or about 10.4%.

Looking at the options, option G is 0.1, which is about 10%. So the probability is approximately 0.1, which is option G.
</think>

To determine the probability of a 2.0-MeV neutron producing fission in a pure U-238 sample of thickness 3.2 cm, we use the formula for the probability of a neutron being absorbed:

\[
P = 1 - \exp(-n \sigma x)
\]

where:
- \( n \) is the number density of U-238 nuclei,
- \( \sigma = 0.68 \, \text{barns} = 0.68 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{cm}^2 \) is the cross-section,
- \( x = 3.2 \, \text{cm} \) is the thickness.

### Step 1: Calculate the number density \( n \)
The density of U-238 is approximately \( \rho = 19.05 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \), and its molar mass is \( M = 238 \, \text{g/mol} \). Using Avogadro's number \( N_A = 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{mol}^{-1} \), the number density is:

\[
n = \left( \frac{\rho}{M} \right) N_A = \left( \frac{19.05}{238} \right) \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} \approx 4.81 \times 10^{22} \, \text{nuclei/cm}^3
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( n \sigma x \)
Substitute the values into \( n \sigma x \):

\[
n \sigma x = (4.81 \times 10^{22}) \times (0.68 \times 10^{-24}) \times 3.2
\]

First, calculate \( 4.81 \times 10^{22} \times 0.68 \times 10^{-24} \):

\[
4.81 \times 0.68 = 3.2728, \quad 3.2728 \times 10^{-2} = 0.032728
\]

Then multiply by \( 3.2 \):

\[
0.032728 \times 3.2 \approx 0.1047
\]

Thus, \( n \sigma x \approx 0.1047 \), which is much less than 1.

### Step 3: Approximate the probability
For small \( n \sigma x \), the exponential term can be approximated as:

\[
\exp(-n \sigma x) \approx 1 - n \sigma x
\]

So the probability of absorption is:

\[
P = 1 - \exp(-n \sigma x) \approx 1 - (1 - 0.1047) = 0.1047
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
The calculated probability is approximately \( 0.1047 \), which corresponds to option **G: 0.1**.
