Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about the effect on savings of a tax cut of $10 billion. It's asking whether this is inflationary or deflationary, and we're given that the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is 0.85. The options are A through J, with various dollar amounts and such.

Hmm, I remember that in macroeconomics, a tax cut affects both consumption and savings. Let me think about how that works. So, when the government cuts taxes, people have more disposable income. The MPC tells us how much of that extra income people will spend versus save.

MPC is 0.85, which means that 85% of any additional income will be spent on consumption. Therefore, the marginal propensity to save (MPS) would be 1 - MPC, right? So that's 1 - 0.85 = 0.15. So, MPS is 0.15.

Wait, but the question is about the effect on savings. So the tax cut is $10 billion. How does that translate to savings? I think the increase in savings would be the tax cut multiplied by the MPS. So that's 10 billion * 0.15. Let me calculate that: 10 * 0.15 is 1.5. So the increase in savings should be $1.5 billion.

Looking at the options, A is $1.5 billion. So that's probably the answer for the effect on savings. Now, the second part is whether this is inflationary or deflationary. A tax cut generally increases aggregate demand because people have more money to spend. This can lead to higher output and possibly inflation if demand outpaces supply. Alternatively, if the economy isn't at full capacity, it might just increase GDP without causing inflation. But in terms of the immediate effect, a tax cut would be expansionary, leading to inflationary pressures because it increases spending, which can drive up prices.

Wait, but the question is about the effect on savings and then whether it's inflationary or deflationary. So the tax cut leads to higher savings, but the overall effect on the economy is that more money is spent, which is inflationary. So the tax cut itself is expansionary, leading to inflationary pressures.

But the first part of the question is about the effect on savings, which I've figured out is $1.5 billion. So the options for the first part are A ($1.5) and G ($-1.5), but since it's a tax cut, savings should increase, so A is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check. The tax cut increases disposable income. People will consume 85% and save 15%. So the increase in savings is 10 billion * 0.15 = 1.5 billion. So A is correct for the first part. As for the effect on the economy, a tax cut increases spending, which is inflationary. So the correct option for the effect is inflationary, but the options don't directly ask for thatâ€”they just present the answers. Wait, looking back at the options, they're all numerical except for maybe some letters, but I think each option is a potential answer to the first part, and the second part is whether it's inflationary or deflationary. Wait, no, the question is a single question: what is the effect on savings, and is this inflationary or deflationary? So the options are for both parts? Or is it two separate questions? Wait, the way it's written: "What is the effect on savings of a tax cut of $10 billion? Is this inflationary or deflationary?" So it's two parts. But the options are A through J, each a single choice. So perhaps the first part is the effect on savings, and the second part is whether it's inflationary or deflationary. But the options are presented as individual choices, so perhaps each option is the answer to one part. Alternatively, perhaps the options are answers to both parts, but I think that's less likely. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the overall effect, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the options are for the effect on savings, and then we have to determine whether it's inflationary or deflationary. Let me read the options again. The options are A: $1.5b, B: $8.5b, etc., up to J: $5b. So the options are all about the effect on savings, but the question also asks whether it's inflationary or deflationary. So perhaps the options are for the effect on savings, and then the inflationary part is a separate yes/no, but in the options given, I don't see any that indicate that. Wait, looking again, the options are just numbers, so perhaps the question is just asking for the effect on savings, and the rest is part of the question but not the options. Wait, the user wrote the options as A to J, each a single value or number, so the question is to pick one option that answers both parts? Or perhaps the first part is the effect on savings, and the second part is the nature (inflationary or deflationary). But the options don't include text, only numbers, so perhaps the options are just for the effect on savings, and the second part is a separate consideration. Alternatively, maybe the options include both the amount and the effect. Wait, looking at the options, I don't see any that combine both. So perhaps the question is only about the effect on savings, and the second part is a follow-up, but the options are only for the savings part.

Wait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me check again: "What is the effect on savings of a tax cut of $10 billion? Is this inflationary or deflationary?" So perhaps it's two separate questions, but the options are all for the first part. Alternatively, perhaps the options include both the effect on savings and the nature of the effect. But looking at the options, I don't see any that have both a number and a term like 'inflationary.' So perhaps the question is only about the effect on savings, and the second part is just additional information, but the answer is the first part. So I think the correct answer for the effect on savings is A: $1.5 billion, and the tax cut is inflationary because it increases spending.

But the options don't include an inflationary choice, so perhaps the options are only for the savings part, and the second part is just a question. So perhaps the answer is A for the effect on savings, and the tax cut is inflationary. But the options don't include that, so maybe the user is just asking for the effect on savings. Alternatively, perhaps the options include both, but I don't see that. So I think the correct answer is A: $1.5 billion.

The effect on savings from a $10 billion tax cut, given a marginal propensity to save (MPS) of 0.15, is an increase of $1.5 billion. This tax cut is inflationary because it leads to increased spending and aggregate demand.
