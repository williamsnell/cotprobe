Alright, so I've got this logic problem to solve. It's about constructing a truth table for a given argument and then determining whether it's valid or invalid. If it's invalid, I need to pick the correct counterexample from the options provided. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let me parse the argument. The premises are given as (G ≡ H) · ~I and ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I), and the conclusion is G. So the argument is:

Premise 1: (G ≡ H) ∧ ~I
Premise 2: ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I)
Conclusion: G

I need to construct a truth table for all possible truth values of G, H, and I. There are three variables, so there will be 2^3 = 8 rows.

Let me list all possible combinations of G, H, I:

1. G=T, H=T, I=T
2. G=T, H=T, I=F
3. G=T, H=F, I=T
4. G=T, H=F, I=F
5. G=F, H=T, I=T
6. G=F, H=T, I=F
7. G=F, H=F, I=T
8. G=F, H=F, I=F

Now, for each row, I'll compute the truth values of the premises and the conclusion.

Let me start with the first row:

1. G=T, H=T, I=T
   - Premise 1: (G ≡ H) is T ≡ T = T. ~I is ~T = F. So (T) · (F) = F.
   - Premise 2: ~G is F. (~H ∨ I) is (~T ∨ T) = (F ∨ T) = T. So F ∨ T = T.
   - Conclusion: G is T.
   - Since Premise 1 is F, the argument doesn't hold here. So the row doesn't make the premises true, so it's not a counterexample.

Wait, but the argument is only when the premises are true. So for a counterexample, we need both premises to be true, and the conclusion to be false. So I should look for rows where Premise1 and Premise2 are true, and Conclusion is false.

So let me proceed to compute each row properly.

Row 1:
G=T, H=T, I=T
Premise1: (T ≡ T) ∧ ~T → T ∧ F → F
Premise2: ~T ∨ (~T ∨ T) → F ∨ (F ∨ T) → F ∨ T → T
Conclusion: T
Since Premise1 is F, not a counterexample.

Row 2:
G=T, H=T, I=F
Premise1: (T ≡ T) ∧ ~F → T ∧ T → T
Premise2: ~T ∨ (~T ∨ F) → F ∨ (F ∨ F) → F ∨ F → F
Conclusion: T
Here, Premise1 is T, Premise2 is F. So the premises are not both true, so not a counterexample.

Row 3:
G=T, H=F, I=T
Premise1: (T ≡ F) ∧ ~T → F ∧ F → F
Premise2: ~T ∨ (~F ∨ T) → F ∨ (T ∨ T) → F ∨ T → T
Conclusion: T
Premise1 is F, so no.

Row4:
G=T, H=F, I=F
Premise1: (T ≡ F) ∧ ~F → F ∧ T → F
Premise2: ~T ∨ (~F ∨ F) → F ∨ (T ∨ F) → F ∨ T → T
Conclusion: T
Again, Premise1 is F, so no.

Row5:
G=F, H=T, I=T
Premise1: (F ≡ T) ∧ ~T → F ∧ F → F
Premise2: ~F ∨ (~T ∨ T) → T ∨ (F ∨ T) → T ∨ T → T
Conclusion: F
Here, Premise1 is F, so not a counterexample.

Row6:
G=F, H=T, I=F
Premise1: (F ≡ T) ∧ ~F → F ∧ T → F
Premise2: ~F ∨ (~T ∨ F) → T ∨ (F ∨ F) → T ∨ F → T
Conclusion: F
Again, Premise1 is F, so no.

Row7:
G=F, H=F, I=T
Premise1: (F ≡ F) ∧ ~T → T ∧ F → F
Premise2: ~F ∨ (~F ∨ T) → T ∨ (T ∨ T) → T ∨ T → T
Conclusion: F
Premise1 is F, so not a counterexample.

Row8:
G=F, H=F, I=F
Premise1: (F ≡ F) ∧ ~F → T ∧ T → T
Premise2: ~F ∨ (~F ∨ F) → T ∨ (T ∨ F) → T ∨ T → T
Conclusion: F
Here, Premise1 is T, Premise2 is T, and Conclusion is F. So this is a counterexample because the premises are true, but the conclusion is false.

Wait, but let me double-check that.

In row8: G=F, H=F, I=F.

Premise1: (G ≡ H) is (F ≡ F) = T. ~I is ~F = T. So T ∧ T = T.

Premise2: ~G is T. (~H ∨ I) is (~F ∨ F) = T ∨ F = T. So T ∨ T = T.

Conclusion: G is F.

So yes, both premises are true, and the conclusion is false. So this row is a counterexample.

Now, looking at the options, which one matches this scenario?

Option C: Invalid. Counterexample when H, I, and G are false. That's exactly row8: G=F, H=F, I=F.

Wait, but let me check the other options to make sure.

Option A: H and G true, I false. That would be G=T, H=T, I=F. In row2, Premise1 is T, Premise2 is F. So not a counterexample.

Option B: H and I true, G false. G=F, H=T, I=T. In row5, Premise1 is F, so not a counterexample.

Option C: H, I, G all false. That's row8, which is a counterexample.

Option D and E say the argument is valid, which it's not because we found a counterexample.

Option F: I=T, H and G=F. G=F, H=F, I=T. Row7: Premise1 is F, so not a counterexample.

Option G: G=T, H and I=F. Row4: Premise1 is F, so no.

Option H: H=T, I and G=F. Row6: Premise1 is F, no.

Option I: H=F, I and G=T. G=T, H=F, I=T. Row3: Premise1 is F, no.

Option J: I=F, H and G=T. Row2: Premise1 is T, but Premise2 is F, so not a counterexample.

So the correct answer is option C: Invalid. Counterexample when H, I, and G are false.

The argument is invalid because there exists a counterexample where the premises are true, and the conclusion is false. Specifically, when G, H, and I are all false, the premises hold, but the conclusion does not.
