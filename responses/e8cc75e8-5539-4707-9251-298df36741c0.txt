Okay, so I need to figure out what the GDP per capita was in the United States in 1850, but adjusted for inflation and PPP into 2011 prices. The options are from about $500 up to $25k, so I need to think about how to approach this.

First, I'm a bit rusty on economic history, but I remember that the US economy has grown a lot over the centuries. In 1850, the US was still a young country, mostly agrarian, with a much smaller population than today. So I'm thinking that GDP per capita back then was probably much lower than it is now.

I recall that GDP per capita in 2011 was around $50k or so, but that's much later. For earlier years, especially the mid-1800s, I think it's lower. But I'm not exactly sure how much lower.

I remember that when adjusting for inflation, especially over such a long period, the numbers can change a lot. Also, PPP (purchasing power parity) matters because it adjusts for cost of living differences across countries or over time.

I think there's an economic concept called the "Great Escapade" where economic growth accelerated in the 19th century. So maybe in 1850, the US was just starting to industrialize, so GDP per capita was increasing but still not very high.

I've heard that in the early 19th century, GDP per capita was around $1k in 2011 dollars. But that's a rough estimate. By 1850, maybe it had doubled? So that would be around $2k? But wait, the options don't have exactly $2k. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, I see option I is about $3k, option D is $1.5k, option E is $5k. So maybe I'm off. Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the numbers. I think the GDP per capita in 1850 was actually around $1.5k to $2k in 2011 terms.

Wait, I think I read somewhere that in 1850, the US GDP per capita was approximately $1.5k in PPP-adjusted 2011 dollars. So that would correspond to option D, which is about $1.5k.

But I'm a bit unsure because I might be mixing up the exact figures. Alternatively, maybe it's higher. I've also heard that by 1900, it was around $5k, so maybe 1850 was lower than that. So perhaps $1.5k is correct.

Another angle: considering that the US was mostly an agricultural society with limited industrialization in 1850. The average person's output wouldn't be as high as in an industrialized economy. So lower GDP per capita makes sense.

I think I'll go with option D: About $1.5k.

The GDP per capita in the United States in 1850, when adjusted for inflation and PPP into 2011 prices, was approximately $1.5k. This aligns with historical estimates that consider the agrarian nature of the economy and the early stages of industrialization during that period.

Answer: D
