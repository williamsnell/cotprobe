Question:

Suppose $f(x)$ is a function that has this property: For all real numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $a<b$, the portion of the graph of $y=f(x)$ between $x=a$ and $x=b$ lies below the line segment whose endpoints are $(a,f(a))$ and $(b,f(b))$. (A function with this property is called strictly convex.) Given that $f(x)$ passes through $(-2,5)$ and $(2,9)$, what is the range of all possible values for $f(1)$? Express your answer in interval notation.

Options:

A: (-inf, 5)
B: (-inf, 7)
C: (-inf, 3)
D: (-inf, 11)
E: (-inf, 9)
F: (-inf, 12)
G: (-inf, 6)
H: (-inf, 10)
I: (-inf, 4)
J: (-inf, 8)

Okay, so I've got this problem about a function f(x) that's strictly convex. The question says that for any two real numbers a and b where a < b, the graph of y = f(x) between x = a and x = b lies below the line segment connecting (a, f(a)) and (b, f(b)). That's the definition of a strictly convex function, right? So I remember that convex functions have this property where the line between any two points on the graph is above the graph itself.

The function passes through the points (-2, 5) and (2, 9). I need to find the range of all possible values for f(1). The answer choices are in interval notation, so I have to figure out what the minimum and maximum possible values f(1) can take are, given the convexity condition.

Wait, actually, since it's strictly convex, the function must lie strictly below the chord between any two points. So, for the interval between x = -2 and x = 2, the function must lie below the straight line connecting (-2,5) and (2,9). That line would have a slope of (9-5)/(2 - (-2)) = 4/4 = 1. So the equation of the line is y = x + b. Plugging in (-2,5), we get 5 = (-2) + b → b=7. So the line is y = x + 7.

Now, since the function is strictly convex, f(1) must be less than the value of this line at x=1. The line at x=1 is y=1 +7=8. So f(1) < 8. But wait, the options include up to 8 as the upper limit. Hmm, but can f(1) be equal to 8? No, because it's strictly convex, so f(1) has to be strictly less than 8. So the maximum possible value is approaching 8 but not reaching it. So the upper bound is 8, but not including 8.

Wait, but the options are intervals ending at various points, like (-inf,8). So the possible values for f(1) would be all real numbers less than 8. So the interval is (-infinity, 8), which corresponds to option J.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing something. Could f(1) be any lower? The function could be very concave down in between, but since it's strictly convex, it can't dip too low. Wait, actually, no. For strictly convex functions, the function lies below the chord, but there's no lower bound given by the points. So f(1) could be any value less than 8. So the range is (-inf, 8), so option J.

The function is strictly convex, so it lies below the chord between any two points. The chord between (-2,5) and (2,9) has a slope of 1 and equation y = x + 7. At x=1, the chord value is 8, so f(1) must be less than 8. Thus, the range is (-∞, 8).
