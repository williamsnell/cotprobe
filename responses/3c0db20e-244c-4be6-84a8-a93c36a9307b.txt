Okay, so I need to figure out the correct answer to this question about the differential diagnosis between bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that both bulimia and anorexia are eating disorders, but they have different key features. The question is asking about a key feature that helps distinguish between the two, so I need to think about what symptoms are more specific to each disorder.

Bulimia nervosa typically involves episodes of binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors like purging (vomiting, laxative use), excessive exercise, or other methods to prevent weight gain. People with bulimia often have a fear of gaining weight, which is also true for anorexia. Anorexia nervosa, on the other hand, is characterized by restrictive eating, leading to significantly low body weight, intense fear of gaining weight, and disturbance in self-perceived weight or shape.

Looking at the options:

A: Use of laxatives. Both might use this, but it's more associated with bulimia because of the purging after binging.

B: Purging. This is definitely a key feature of bulimia, where they vomit or use laxatives after binging. Anorexics might purge if they eat something they shouldn't, but it's not the main feature.

C: Fear of gaining weight. Both disorders have this, so it's not a differentiator.

D: Bingeing. Bulimia involves regular bingeing, while anorexia typically doesn't. Anorexics might restrict their food intake but not necessarily binge.

E: Excessive exercise. Both might do this, but again, bulimia uses it as a way to compensate for binging, while anorexia might use it to control weight.

F: All of the above. Hmm, but not all apply to both or are differentiating.

G: Maintaining a normal body weight. Anorexics have low body weight, while bulimics might be normal or slightly overweight. So this is a differentiator.

H: Overeating in short periods. Not sure, but might relate to bingeing.

I: None of the above.

J: Self-imposed starvation. This is more characteristic of anorexia, where they severely restrict food intake.

So the key features for differential diagnosis would be things like bingeing and purging (which are more bulimia) versus self-imposed starvation and maintaining a low body weight (more anorexia). The question is about a key feature that makes the differential diagnosis.

Wait, the options are single letters. So looking for a single feature that helps differentiate. Let's see the options again.

The question is asking for a key feature. So perhaps the presence of bingeing and purging is a key feature of bulimia, whereas anorexia has self-imposed starvation and fear of gaining weight with low body weight.

So looking at the options, G is maintaining a normal body weight. In bulimia, they might have normal weight, while anorexia leads to underweight. So that's a differentiator. Alternatively, J is self-imposed starvation, which is more anorexia.

Wait, the question is about making the differential diagnosis, so perhaps the key feature is whether the person binges and purges (bulimia) or starves and fears gaining weight (anorexia). But the options are single features.

Looking at the options, C is fear of gaining weight, which both have. So it's not a differentiator. G is maintaining a normal body weight, which is more bulimia. J is self-imposed starvation, which is anorexia.

So the key feature would be something like maintaining normal weight (bulimia) vs. starvation and low weight (anorexia). But the options given are single features.

Wait, the question is about one key feature. So perhaps the answer is G: maintaining a normal body weight, because anorexics are underweight, while bulimics might be normal or slightly overweight.

Alternatively, another key feature is the presence of bingeing and purging versus self-imposed starvation.

Wait, the options are A-J, and the question is about a key feature for making the differential diagnosis. So perhaps the answer is G: maintaining a normal body weight, because that's a key point where they differ.

Wait, but another thought: the presence of self-imposed starvation is a key feature of anorexia, while bulimia involves compensatory behaviors like purging after bingeing.

So the key features are: bulimia has bingeing and purging, while anorexia has self-imposed starvation and fear of gaining weight with low body weight.

Now, looking at the options, J is self-imposed starvation, which is specific to anorexia. So if a patient is engaging in self-starvation, that points towards anorexia, whereas if they are binging and purging, that's bulimia.

So the key feature for differential diagnosis would be the presence of self-imposed starvation (J) or maintaining a normal weight (G). But the options are separate.

Wait, the question is asking for one key feature. So perhaps the answer is G: maintaining a normal body weight. Because anorexics have low body weight, while bulimics may have normal or near-normal weight.

Alternatively, the presence of self-imposed starvation (J) is a key feature of anorexia, whereas bulimia doesn't typically involve self-starvation but rather cycles of bingeing and purging.

So the key features are:

- Bulimia: Bingeing, purging, fear of gaining weight, sometimes normal weight.

- Anorexia: Self-starvation, fear of gaining weight, low body weight.

So if the question is about a key feature that helps differentiate, perhaps the presence of self-imposed starvation (J) is more indicative of anorexia, while maintaining a normal weight (G) is more indicative of bulimia.

But the question is about the key feature for making the differential diagnosis. So the presence of self-starvation would point to anorexia, while the presence of bingeing and purging would point to bulimia.

Wait, the options include 'B: Purging' and 'D: Bingeing'. But both can occur in both disorders, but more prominently in bulimia.

Alternatively, the key differentiator is whether the individual is underweight (anorexia) or has a normal weight (bulimia). So G: maintaining a normal body weight is a key feature.

Wait, but the answer options are A-J, and I think the correct answer is G: Maintaining a normal body weight. Because in bulimia, the person may have a normal weight despite the binging and purging, whereas in anorexia, they are underweight.

So the key feature is whether the person is maintaining a normal body weight (bulimia) or is underweight due to self-starvation (anorexia).

Therefore, the answer should be G: Maintaining a normal body weight.

The key feature for differentiating bulimia nervosa from anorexia nervosa is whether the individual maintains a normal body weight, as seen in bulimia, versus being underweight due to self-imposed starvation, which is characteristic of anorexia.

Answer: G
