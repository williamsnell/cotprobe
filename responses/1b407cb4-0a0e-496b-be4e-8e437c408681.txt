Okay, I need to figure out which Hindu festival involves decorating the house with lights, setting off firecrackers, and wearing new clothes. Let me think about the options one by one.

First, I remember that Deepavali, also known as Diwali, is the festival of lights. I think it's when people light lamps and use fireworks. So that's a strong candidate.

Looking at the options:

A: Pongal – I think this is a harvest festival in some parts of India, maybe not the one with lights and fireworks.

B: Ganesh Chaturthi – This is when Lord Ganesha is worshipped, often with statues and processions, but I don't recall it being associated with lighting the house or firecrackers as much.

C: Janmashtami – This is Lord Krishna's birthday. People might light lamps, but I'm not sure about firecrackers. I think it's more about midnight celebrations and puja.

D: Holi – This is the festival of colors, where people throw colored powders. There's music and dancing, but not so much about lighting up the house with lights or fireworks. Although, some areas might have firecrackers, I'm not certain.

E: Karva Chauth – This is a fasting festival for women, focusing on the moon and asking for their husband's longevity. Not really about decorations with lights or fireworks.

F: Makar Sankranti – This is a harvest festival celebrated in many parts of India. It involves flying kites and some sweets, but I don't think it's about decorating houses with lights or firecrackers.

G: Deepavali – As I thought earlier, this is the festival of lights. People decorate their homes with lamps, set off firecrackers, and wear new clothes. This seems to fit perfectly.

H: Navaratri – This is a nine-night festival celebrating the goddess. It includes puja and sometimes dance performances, but I don't recall it involving widespread use of lights or fireworks.

I: Raksha Bandhan – This is about the bond between brothers and sisters. People exchange sweets and gifts, but not particularly known for lighting up the house or firecrackers.

So, putting it all together, the festival described in the question is Deepavali, which is option G.
