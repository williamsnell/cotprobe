Alright, so I need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 36 and 90. Hmm, okay, let's start by recalling what the GCF is. The GCF of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. So, I need to find the largest number that can divide both 36 and 90 exactly.

First, maybe I should list out all the factors of each number and then see which is the largest common one. That sounds like a straightforward approach, though it might take some time.

Starting with 36. The factors of 36 are the numbers that multiply together to give 36. Let me think: 1 and 36, 2 and 18, 3 and 12, 4 and 9, 6 and 6. So the factors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36.

Now for 90. I'll list its factors similarly. 1 and 90, 2 and 45, 3 and 30, 5 and 18, 6 and 15, 9 and 10. Wait, let me make sure I don't miss any. So factors are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, 90.

Now I need to find the common factors in both lists. Let's see:

From 36: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36.

From 90: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, 90.

Looking for overlaps: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18. Those are the common factors.

The greatest of these is 18. So the GCF should be 18.

Wait, but let me double-check another way to make sure I didn't miss anything. Maybe using prime factorization would help confirm.

Prime factors of 36: Let's break it down. 36 divided by 2 is 18, divided by 2 again is 9, which is 3 squared. So the prime factors are 2^2 * 3^2.

Prime factors of 90: 90 divided by 2 is 45, which is 9*5. So 2 * 3^2 * 5^1.

Now, the GCF is the product of the lowest powers of common primes. So both have 2^1 and 3^2. So that's 2 * 3 * 3 = 18. Yep, that matches what I found earlier.

Alternatively, I could use the Euclidean algorithm. Let me try that too. The Euclidean algorithm is where you divide the larger number by the smaller and then take the remainder and repeat until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCF.

So, 90 divided by 36 is 2 with a remainder of 18 (because 36*2=72, 90-72=18).

Now take 36 and divide by 18. 36 รท 18 is exactly 2 with no remainder. So the last non-zero remainder is 18, which means the GCF is 18. That's consistent with my other methods.

So all three methods point to 18 being the GCF. Looking back at the options, I see option I is 18, so that should be the answer.

The greatest common factor of 36 and 90 is 18.
