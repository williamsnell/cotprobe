Okay, so I've got this logic problem to solve. It's about translating a sentence into PL (Predicate Logic) using the given options. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The sentence is: "Either England's importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture or China promotes human rights given that South Africa doesn't supply diamonds."

Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful, but I'll try to parse it. So, it's saying that one of two things is true. The first part is that England importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture. The second part is that China promotes human rights given that South Africa doesn't supply diamonds.

Let me think about what each part means. 

First part: "England's importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture." In logic terms, a necessary condition is often expressed as an implication. If something is a necessary condition, it means that without it, the other thing can't happen. So, France's subsidizing agriculture (let's call that F) would require England importing beef (E). So, F implies E, or F → E. Alternatively, E is a necessary condition for F, so F can't happen without E, which is F → E.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, necessary condition. Let me recall: If A is necessary for B, then B → A. Because B can't happen unless A happens. So, if E is a necessary condition for F, then F → E. So, the first part is F → E, which can be written as F ⊃ E.

Second part: "China promotes human rights given that South Africa doesn't supply diamonds." So, this is a conditional statement. If South Africa doesn't supply diamonds (~S), then China promotes human rights (C). So, that's ~S → C. Alternatively, in PL, it's written as ~S ⊃ C.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see some have ~S and others have ~C. Let me make sure I get the direction right. The sentence says "given that South Africa doesn't supply diamonds," which is the condition. So, the structure is: if ~S, then C. So, ~S implies C, which is ~S ⊃ C.

Now, the entire sentence is an OR between these two conditions. So, it's (F → E) OR (~S → C). In PL, that would be (F ⊃ E) ∨ (~S ⊃ C). 

Looking at the options, option A is exactly that: (F ⊃ E) ∨ (~S ⊃ C). So that seems correct. 

Wait, but let me check the other options to make sure. Let's see:

Option B: (E ≡ F) ∨ (C ⊃ ~S). E and F being equivalent doesn't seem right because the first part is a necessary condition, not a biconditional. And the second part is C → ~S, which is the opposite of what we have (~S → C). So B is out.

Option C: (F ≡ E) ∨ (S ≡ ~C). Again, equivalence where it should be implication. Also, the second part is S ↔ ~C, which isn't what we have. So C is incorrect.

Option D: (F ⊃ E) ∨ (S ≡ C). The first part is correct, but the second part is S ↔ C, which is not the same as ~S → C. So D is wrong.

Option E: (E ⊃ F) ∨ (S ⊃ ~C). Wait, the first part here is E → F, which would mean that E is sufficient for F, but the original says E is necessary for F, so it should be F → E. So E's first part is reversed. Also, the second part is S → ~C, which is the inverse of what we need. So E is incorrect.

Option F: (F ⊃ E) ∨ (~S ≡ C). The first part is correct, but the second part is ~S ↔ C, which is a biconditional, not a simple implication. So F is wrong.

Option G: (E ⊃ F) ∨ (C ⊃ S). Again, E → F is reversed from F → E, so incorrect. Also, the second part is C → S, which is not what we have. So G is out.

Option H: (E ⊃ F) ∨ (~C ⊃ S). Again, first part is reversed. Second part is ~C → S, which isn't our conditional. So H is wrong.

Option I: (E ⊃ F) ∨ (~S ≡ ~C). First part is reversed. Second part is a biconditional between ~S and ~C, which isn't the same as ~S → C. So I is incorrect.

Option J: (E ⊃ F) ∨ (C ≡ ~S). First part is reversed, and the second part is a biconditional, which doesn't match the implication. So J is out.

So after checking all options, only option A matches the structure we derived: (F ⊃ E) ∨ (~S ⊃ C). Therefore, the correct answer is A.

The sentence can be broken down into two parts connected by "or." The first part states that England's importing beef (E) is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture (F), which translates to F → E or F ⊃ E. The second part states that China promotes human rights (C) given that South Africa doesn't supply diamonds (~S), which translates to ~S → C or ~S ⊃ C. Combining these with "or" gives (F ⊃ E) ∨ (~S ⊃ C). Among the options, only option A matches this structure.
