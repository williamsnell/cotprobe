Okay, so I have this problem about thermal conductivities of acetylene (C₂H₂) and nitrogen (N₂) at the same temperature and pressure. The question is asking for the ratio of their collisional cross sections. Hmm, I need to figure out how to approach this.

First, I remember that thermal conductivity (κ) is related to the properties of gases. I think the formula involves the mean free path and the specific heat capacity. Oh wait, I recall the formula for thermal conductivity is κ = (1/3) * n * v * λ * Cv, where n is number density, v is the average speed, λ is the mean free path, and Cv is the molar specific heat at constant volume.

But wait, since both gases are at the same temperature and pressure, some terms might cancel out. Let me think. At the same pressure and temperature, the number density n is inversely proportional to molar mass, because n = P/(RT), and pressure and T are same. So n is proportional to 1/M, where M is molar mass.

The average speed v is given by the root mean square speed formula, which is sqrt(3RT/M). So v is proportional to 1/sqrt(M).

The mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the collisional cross section σ squared times the number density n. The formula is λ = 1/(√2 * n * σ). So λ is proportional to 1/(n σ) = M/(σ √2), since n = P/(RT) = 1/(M RT/P) but wait, I think it's better to think of λ as proportional to 1/(n σ). Since n is proportional to 1/M, λ becomes proportional to M/(σ), because 1/n is M, so M * 1/(σ) would be the proportionality.

Wait, let me recheck that. λ = 1/(√2 * n σ). Since n is proportional to 1/M, n = k/M where k is a constant. So λ = 1/( (k/M) * σ * √2 ) ) = M/(k σ √2). So λ is proportional to M/(σ).

Putting it all together, κ = (1/3) n v λ Cv. Let's plug in each term.

n is proportional to 1/M.
v is proportional to 1/sqrt(M).
λ is proportional to M/(σ).
Cv is the molar specific heat. For diatomic gases like N₂, Cv is (5/2)R, and for linear molecules like acetylene (which is a linear triatomic, so maybe Cv is (5/2)R as well? Or wait, wait—acetylene is C₂H₂, which is a linear molecule with 5 atoms (2 C and 3 H?), no, wait, each molecule is C₂H₂, so each molecule has 2 carbons and 2 hydrogens, making 4 atoms? No, wait, no—each molecule has 2 carbons and 2 hydrogens, so 4 atoms in total, but arranged linearly. So the degrees of freedom would be 3 translational, 2 rotational (since linear), and vibrational. But at 273 K, which is around room temperature, maybe the vibrational modes aren't active, so Cv would be 3/2 R (translational) + 2/2 R (rotational) = (5/2) R.

Wait, but wait—acetylene is a linear molecule, so it has 2 rotational degrees of freedom. So for each molecule, Cv is (f/2) R, where f is the degrees of freedom. So for translation, f=3, so 3/2 R. For rotation, f=2, so 1 R. So total Cv is (5/2) R. Similarly for N₂, which is diatomic, so same thing: 3 translational, 2 rotational, so same Cv of (5/2) R.

Wait, but wait—is that correct? Because for diatomic gases like N₂, at room temperature, the rotational modes are active, so Cv is (5/2) R. For polyatomic gases, like acetylene, which is linear, again, same Cv. So in this case, both have the same Cv, because they both have 5/2 R. So Cv cancels out when taking the ratio.

So putting all together, κ is proportional to n * v * λ * Cv. Since Cv is same for both, it cancels. So κ ∝ n * v * λ.

Let me write each term in terms of M and σ.

n ∝ 1/M
v ∝ 1/sqrt(M)
λ ∝ M/(σ)

Multiplying these together:

n * v * λ ∝ (1/M) * (1/sqrt(M)) * (M/σ) ) 

Let's compute that:

(1/M) * (1/sqrt(M)) = 1/(M^(3/2)).

Then multiply by M/σ: [1/(M^(3/2))] * (M/σ) ) = (1) / (M^(1/2) σ).

So κ ∝ 1/(M^(1/2) σ).

Wait, but wait—that can't be right. Because when you multiply all the terms, you get 1/(M^(3/2)) * M/(σ) ) → [1/(M^(3/2)) ] * (M/σ) ) = [ M / (M^(3/2) σ) ) ] = [ 1/(M^(1/2) σ) ) ].

So κ ∝ 1/(sqrt(M) * σ).

So the thermal conductivity is inversely proportional to sqrt(M) times the collisional cross section.

Wait, but wait—am I missing a factor? Let me check the proportionality again.

κ ∝ n v λ.

n is 1/M, v is 1/sqrt(M), λ is M/(σ).

So n*v = (1/M) * (1/sqrt(M)) ) = 1/(M^(3/2)).

Then n*v*λ = [1/(M^(3/2)) ] * [ M/(σ) ] = [ M/(M^(3/2)) ] * (1/σ) ) → 1/(M^(1/2)) * (1/σ) → 1/(M^(1/2) σ).

So yes, κ ∝ 1/(sqrt(M) * σ).

So the ratio of thermal conductivities κ1/κ2 would be ( sqrt(M2) * σ2 ) / ( sqrt(M1) * σ1 ).

Because if κ ∝ 1/(sqrt(M) σ), then κ1/κ2 = [ (sqrt(M2) σ2 ) ] / [ sqrt(M1) σ1 ) ].

Wait, let me think again. Let me write:

κ1 = k / (sqrt(M1) σ1)
κ2 = k / (sqrt(M2) σ2)

So κ1/κ2 = [k/(sqrt(M1)σ1)] / [k/(sqrt(M2) σ2)] ] = [ sqrt(M2) σ2 ] / [ sqrt(M1) σ1 ]

Which is the same as (σ2/σ1) * sqrt(M2/M1).

Wait, no, wait: sqrt(M2)/sqrt(M1) is sqrt(M2/M1).

So κ1/κ2 = (σ2/σ1) * sqrt(M2/M1).

Wait, but in our case, which is acetylene and N₂. Let me denote:

Let me assign:

Gas 1: Acetylene (C₂H₂)

Gas 2: N₂

Given:

κ1 = 0.01866 J K⁻¹ m⁻¹ s⁻¹

κ2 = 0.0240 J K⁻¹ m⁻¹ s⁻¹

We need to find the ratio σ1/σ2, where σ1 is the collisional cross section of acetylene, and σ2 is that of N₂.

Wait, no—the question is asking for the ratio of acetylene's cross section relative to N₂, which is σ1/σ2.

So let's compute the ratio κ1/κ2.

From the formula:

κ1/κ2 = [ (σ2 / σ1) ) * sqrt(M2 / M1) ) ]

We can rearrange this to solve for σ1/σ2.

Let me write:

κ1/κ2 = (σ2/σ1) * sqrt(M2/M1)

=> (σ2/σ1) = (κ1/κ2) / sqrt(M2/M1)

But we want σ1/σ2, so take reciprocal:

σ1/σ2 = [ sqrt(M2/M1) ) ] / (κ1/κ2 )

Because (σ2/σ1) = (κ1/κ2) * sqrt(M2/M1), so σ1/σ2 = 1/( (κ1/κ2) * sqrt(M2/M1) ) ) = (κ2/κ1) * sqrt(M1/M2).

So σ1/σ2 = (κ2/κ1) * sqrt(M1/M2)

Now, plug in the numbers.

Molar masses:

C₂H₂: Carbon is 12 g/mol, H is 1 g/mol. So 2*12 + 2*1 = 24 + 2 = 26 g/mol.

N₂: 2*14 = 28 g/mol.

So M1 = 26 g/mol, M2 = 28 g/mol.

κ1 = 0.01866, κ2 = 0.0240.

Compute κ2/κ1: 0.0240 / 0.01866 ≈ let's compute that.

0.024 / 0.01866 ≈ 1.286.

Then sqrt(M1/M2) = sqrt(26/28) = sqrt(13/14) ≈ sqrt(0.9286) ≈ 0.9635.

Multiply these two: 1.286 * 0.9635 ≈ 1.240.

Wait, that's the ratio σ1/σ2 ≈ 1.24.

Wait, but wait—no, I think I made a miscalculation in the formula. Let me double-check.

Wait, earlier I derived that σ1/σ2 = (κ2/κ1) * sqrt(M1/M2)

So plugging in the numbers:

κ2/κ1 = 0.0240 / 0.01866 ≈ 1.286.

sqrt(M1/M2) = sqrt(26/28) ≈ 0.9635.

So 1.286 * 0.9635 ≈ 1.24.

So σ1/σ2 ≈ 1.24, which would mean that acetylene's cross section is about 1.24 times that of N₂.

But wait, looking at the options, the highest is 2.00 (option G), but none is around 1.24. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is the other way around. Let me double-check.

I think I might have messed up the formula. Let me go back.

The formula is κ ∝ 1/(sqrt(M) * σ).

So for gas 1 and gas 2, κ1 = k / (sqrt(M1) σ1), κ2 = k/(sqrt(M2) σ2).

So κ1/κ2 = [ sqrt(M2) σ2 ] / [ sqrt(M1) σ1 ]

So (κ1/κ2) = (σ2/σ1) * sqrt(M2/M1)

We want σ1/σ2, so:

σ1/σ2 = (sqrt(M2/M1) ) / (κ1/κ2)

Wait, let me plug in the numbers again.

κ1 = 0.01866, κ2=0.0240.

So κ1/κ2 = 0.01866 / 0.0240 ≈ 0.7775.

M2 = 28, M1=26.

sqrt(M2/M1) = sqrt(28/26) = sqrt(14/13) ≈ sqrt(1.0769) ≈ 1.0377.

So σ1/σ2 = (1.0377) / (0.7775) ≈ 1.333.

Hmm, 1.333 is approximately 4/3, which is about 1.33. Looking at the options, option E is 1.33.

Wait, that makes sense. So σ1/σ2 ≈ 1.33, so the ratio is 1.33, meaning acetylene's cross section is 1.33 times that of N₂.

Wait, but this seems a bit high. Let me check the calculations again.

Compute κ1/κ2: 0.01866 / 0.0240 = 0.01866 ÷ 0.024 = 0.7775.

sqrt(28/26) = sqrt(1.076923) ≈ 1.0377.

So 1.0377 / 0.7775 ≈ 1.333.

Yes, that's correct.

So the ratio σ1/σ2 is approximately 1.33, which is option E.

The thermal conductivity of a gas is related to its collisional cross section and molar mass. Using the formula for thermal conductivity, the ratio of collisional cross sections of acetylene (C₂H₂) to nitrogen (N₂) can be determined. The thermal conductivity is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass and the collisional cross section. By solving the ratio of thermal conductivities and incorporating the molar masses of the gases, the collisional cross section ratio is calculated to be approximately 1.33.
