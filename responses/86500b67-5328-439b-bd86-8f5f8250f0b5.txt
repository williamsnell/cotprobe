Question:

A 77-year-old man is brought to the physician because of a 12-hour history of word-finding difficulty and weakness and sensory loss of the right arm and leg. He has no history of similar symptoms. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. Current medications include metformin, lisinopril, and aspirin. He is alert. His pulse is 80/min and irregular, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 170/90 mm Hg. He follows commands but has nonfluent aphasia. There is moderate weakness and decreased sensation of the right upper and lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Babinski sign is present on the right. His serum glucose concentration is 162 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?

Options:

A: Echocardiogram
B: Serum electrolyte test
C: CT scan of the head
D: Blood culture
E: Lumbar puncture
F: Carotid duplex ultrasonography
G: MRI of the spine
H: Chest X-ray
I: Thyroid function test
J: EEG

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the next step in diagnosing this 77-year-old man. Let me break down the information given.

He's presenting with a 12-hour history of word-finding difficulty and weakness and sensory loss in his right arm and leg. No prior similar issues. His medical history includes type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. He's on metformin, lisinopril, and aspirin. Current vitals: pulse 80 irregular (probably due to AFib), BP 170/90, which is a bit high but not immediately alarming. He's alert but has nonfluent aphasia, right-sided weakness and sensory loss, and a positive Babinski sign on the right. His glucose is 162, which is a bit high but not critically so.

So, his symptoms suggest a stroke. Aphasia, weakness, sensory loss on the right, and Babinski (which indicates possible upper motor neuron lesion) all point towards a stroke. The sudden onset makes me think it's acute, maybe within the past 12 hours.

Now, the question is about the next diagnostic step. Let's look at the options:

A: Echocardiogram – Could check for heart issues, maybe a source of emboli, but if it's an acute stroke, imaging the brain seems more immediate.

B: Serum electrolyte test – Could rule out metabolic issues, but again, not the first step in stroke workup.

C: CT scan of the head – This is often the first imaging done in a stroke patient to check for infarction, hemorrhage, etc.

D: Blood culture – Not indicated here unless there's a suspicion of infection, which doesn't seem to be the case.

E: Lumbar puncture – For possible meningitis, but the presentation doesn't suggest that.

F: Carotid duplex – Looks at carotid artery stenosis, which is a risk factor but maybe not the immediate next step if imaging the brain is needed.

G: MRI of the spine – Doesn't seem related to the symptoms described.

H: Chest X-ray – Maybe for heart issues or other causes, but not the top priority here.

I: Thyroid function test – Unlikely related to acute symptoms.

J: EEG – Could show seizure activity but not directly show stroke.

So, considering all this, the most appropriate next step would be a CT scan of the head to confirm if there's a stroke (ischemic vs hemorrhagic) and to look for any structural issues. Even though MRI is more sensitive for strokes, especially in the acute setting, CT is faster and more readily available, so it's usually the first choice.

The most appropriate next step in diagnosis is a CT scan of the head to assess for stroke or other brain abnormalities.

C: CT scan of the head

Answer: C
