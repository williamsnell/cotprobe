Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the money supply when the FED sells government securities. Hmm, I remember that the reserve requirement is the amount of funds that banks must hold in reserve against their deposits. Here, the reserve requirement is five percent, which I think is 5%.

The question says the FED sells $10 million worth of government securities. I think when the FED sells securities, it's a contractionary monetary policy move. They're taking money out of the economy to reduce the money supply.

Wait, how does that work exactly? When the FED sells securities, they receive money from buyers. This reduces the amount of money in the banking system because those funds are now with the FED. So the banks have less money to lend out.

The reserve requirement is 5%, which means that banks must keep 5% of their deposits as reserves. So the money multiplier comes into play here. The money multiplier is 1 divided by the reserve requirement. So in this case, it's 1 / 0.05 = 20. That means each dollar of reserves can support $20 in the money supply.

But wait, the FED is selling $10 million, so the initial change is a decrease of $10 million in the money supply. But because of the money multiplier, the total effect would be multiplied by 20. So the total decrease would be 10 million * 20 = $200 million.

Looking at the options, option A is a decrease of $200 million, and option B is a decrease of $100 million. So the correct answer should be A, a decrease by $200 million.

When the FED sells $10 million in government securities, it reduces the money available in the banking system. With a reserve requirement of 5%, the money multiplier is 20. Thus, the money supply decreases by $10 million * 20 = $200 million.

Answer: A
