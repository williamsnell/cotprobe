Okay, so I have this economics question here about the potential money created after the Fed increases bank reserves. The question is asking which scenario would diminish that potential amount. The options are A through E, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, let me try to recall some basic concepts. I remember that when the Fed increases bank reserves, it's part of their monetary policy to influence the money supply. Banks can use these additional reserves to make more loans, which in turn increases the money supply through the fractional reserve banking system. The money multiplier effect comes into play here, where a small increase in reserves can lead to a larger increase in the overall money supply.

So the question is about what would make this potential money creation less, meaning the multiplier effect is weaker. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: The public prefers to hold less cash. Hmm, if people hold less cash, they might keep more in banks, which could lead to more deposits and thus more lending. But wait, if the public holds less cash, that might actually increase the money in the banking system because cash is part of the money supply (like M0 or M1). But I'm not sure how this directly affects the banks' ability to create more money. Maybe if people keep their money in banks, it increases deposits, which allows banks to lend more, but the Fed's action is about the reserves, not the deposits. So this might not directly diminish the money creation from increased reserves. Maybe A isn't the right answer.

Option B: The Fed decreases the money supply. That seems contradictory because the question is about the Fed increasing reserves. If the Fed is decreasing the money supply elsewhere, perhaps through other means like selling bonds, that could offset the increase in reserves. But I'm not sure if this is the best option because the question is specifically about the effect after the Fed increases reserves. So maybe B isn't the right choice either.

Option C: Depository institutions decide to hold less excess reserves. Wait, excess reserves are the reserves beyond what banks are required to hold. If banks hold less, they have more funds to lend. So if they decide to hold less, that should actually increase the money creation because they can make more loans, which increases the money supply. So this would amplify the effect, not diminish it. So C might not be the answer.

Option D: The velocity of money increases. Velocity refers to how quickly money circulates in the economy. If velocity increases, each dollar is used more times, which can increase the overall money supply. But how does that relate to the Fed's action? If velocity increases, it might mean that the same amount of money can support more transactions, but I'm not sure how that directly affects the creation of money from increased reserves. Maybe this isn't the right answer either.

Option E: Depository institutions decide to hold more excess reserves. Ah, so if banks hold more excess reserves, they have less funds available to lend. That would mean they can't create as much money through loans. So when the Fed increases reserves, if banks just hold onto more of them instead of lending, the money multiplier effect is weaker. Thus, the potential money created would be less. This seems to fit because the banks aren't using the extra reserves to expand their lending, which is the main way the money supply grows.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be E because holding more excess reserves by banks reduces the ability to create more money through loans.

The potential amount of money created after the Fed increases bank reserves will be diminished if depository institutions decide to hold more excess reserves, as this reduces their ability to lend and expand the money supply.

Answer: E
