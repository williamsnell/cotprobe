Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Based on the paper “SoK: SSL and HTTPS: Revisiting past challenges and evaluating certificates trust model enhancements”, which of the following statements are false?

Options:

A: Valid DV certificates provide more confidence to a user that she is connecting to the intended party than valid EV certificates.
B: OCSP stapling allows a server to prove to a browser that its certificate hasn’t been revoked.
C: DANE makes it difficult for an adversary to launch a SSL stripping attack.
D: Server key-pinning makes it harder for an adversary to convince a CA to mint a certificate for a site and launch an MITM attack on that site.

Answer:

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about SSL and HTTPS based on a paper I've read. The question asks which statements are false. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A says: "Valid DV certificates provide more confidence to a user that she is connecting to the intended party than valid EV certificates." Wait, I remember that DV (Domain Validated) certificates only verify that the entity controlling the domain is the certificate owner. They don't validate the organization or the identity, so they're considered lower trust. On the other hand, EV (Extended Validation) certificates require more stringent checks, including organization validation. So users have more confidence with EV because it's more secure. So A is saying the opposite, so A is false.

Option B: "OCSP stapling allows a server to prove to a browser that its certificate hasn’t been revoked." OCSP stapling is a technique where the server includes an OCSP response (signed by the CA) with the certificate. This proves the certificate is still valid at the time of issuance. So B is correct, not false.

Option C: "DANE makes it difficult for an adversary to launch a SSL stripping attack." DANE (DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities) uses DNS records to publish certificate information. It helps prevent certain types of attacks because the browser can verify the certificate against the DANE record. SSL stripping is when an attacker downgrades HTTPS to HTTP, allowing them to intercept traffic. DANE can prevent this because it enforces the use of HTTPS if configured properly. So C is true, not false.

Option D: "Server key-pinning makes it harder for an adversary to convince a CA to mint a certificate for a site and launch an MITM attack." Server key-pinning refers to the practice where a client remembers the server's public key from a previous session. If the server presents a different key in the future, the client knows something is wrong. This would make it harder for an adversary to get a valid certificate because the client won't accept a new certificate if the key doesn't match. So D is correct, not false.

So the false statements are A and... wait, only A is false? Wait, the question asks which are false. The options are A to D, and the user is to select all that are false. But in the options, only A is false. Let me double-check.

Wait, the question says "which of the following statements are false." So each option is a statement; which ones are false. So from the analysis, only A is false. The other options (B, C, D) are correct. So the false statement is A.

Wait, but the options are A to D, each a single statement. So the answer would be A is false. So the answer is A.

The false statement is A.

Answer: A
