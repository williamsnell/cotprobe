Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a cannon on a truck. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The truck is moving forward at 5 m/s, and the cannon has a muzzle velocity of 50 m/s. The goal is to find the angle the operator should point the cannon so the ball goes as far as possible.

Wait, I remember that in projectile motion, the maximum range is achieved at a 45-degree angle when there's no air resistance and the landing point is at the same elevation as the launch point. But wait, this is a bit different because the cannon is on a moving truck. Oh right, the truck's speed affects the projectile's initial velocity relative to the ground.

So the truck is moving forward at 5 m/s, and the cannon's muzzle velocity is 50 m/s. If the operator points the cannon straight up (90 degrees), the ball would go straight up and come straight down, but since the truck is moving, the ball would land behind the truck. Wait, no, actually, when the ball is fired, the truck's velocity adds to the ball's velocity vector. So the ball's horizontal component would be the truck's speed plus the horizontal component of the cannon's velocity.

Wait, no, the cannon is on the truck. So when the cannon fires, the ball's velocity relative to the truck is 50 m/s at some angle θ. But the truck itself is moving forward at 5 m/s. So the ball's velocity relative to the ground would be the vector sum of the truck's velocity and the cannon's muzzle velocity.

So the ball's horizontal velocity relative to the ground is the sum of the truck's velocity (5 m/s) and the cannon's horizontal component (50 * cosθ). The vertical component is 50 * sinθ.

The range of the projectile would depend on how long it's in the air. The time of flight is determined by the vertical motion. The time up and down is given by (2 * v_vertical) / g. So time t = (2 * 50 sinθ) / 9.8.

But wait, the horizontal distance the ball travels relative to the ground is (5 + 50 cosθ) * t. Because the truck is moving forward, the ball's horizontal velocity isn't just 50 cosθ; it's that plus the truck's 5 m/s.

So the total range R is (5 + 50 cosθ) * (2 * 50 sinθ) / 9.8.

I can simplify this equation. Let's see: R = (5 + 50 cosθ) * (100 sinθ) / 9.8.

Wait, 2*50 is 100, so yes. So R = (50 cosθ +5) * (100 sinθ) / 9.8.

R = (5 +50 cosθ)(100 sinθ)/9.8.

Hmm, that's a bit complicated. To find the maximum R, I might need to take the derivative of R with respect to θ and set it to zero. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to find the optimal angle without calculus.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this as the ball being launched with an initial velocity that's the vector sum of the truck's velocity and the cannon's velocity. Wait, no, the truck's velocity is the base, and the cannon adds on top of that. So the total velocity of the ball is (vx_truck + vx_cannon, vy_cannon).

Wait, but maybe it's better to model the ball's velocity as (5 + 50 cosθ, 50 sinθ). Because the truck is moving at 5 m/s in the x-direction, so the ball's x-component is 5 plus the cannon's x-component.

So, the range R is the horizontal distance covered, which is (5 +50 cosθ) multiplied by the time of flight. The time of flight is determined by the vertical motion. The vertical component is 50 sinθ, so time up is (50 sinθ)/g, and time down is the same, so total time is 2*(50 sinθ)/9.8.

So R = (5 +50 cosθ) * (100 sinθ)/9.8.

Wait, that's the same as before. Let me write it as R = (5 +50 cosθ) * (100 sinθ) / 9.8.

Hmm, to find the maximum R, I can take the derivative of R with respect to θ and set it to zero.

Let me denote f(θ) = (5 +50 cosθ) * sinθ.

Then R is proportional to f(θ). So to maximize R, I need to maximize f(θ).

So f(θ) = 5 sinθ + 50 cosθ sinθ.

We can write this as f(θ) = 5 sinθ + 25 sin(2θ), because 2 cosθ sinθ = sin(2θ), so 50 cosθ sinθ = 25 sin(2θ).

So f(θ) =5 sinθ +25 sin(2θ).

Now, to find the maximum of f(θ), take the derivative f’(θ) and set it to zero.

f’(θ) =5 cosθ +25 * 2 cos(2θ).

Set f’(θ)=0: 5 cosθ +50 cos(2θ) =0.

Hmm, that's 5 cosθ +50 cos(2θ) =0.

We can use the double-angle identity: cos(2θ) = 2cos²θ -1.

So substitute:

5 cosθ +50 (2cos²θ -1) =0.

Expanding:

5 cosθ +100 cos²θ -50 =0.

Rearranging:

100 cos²θ +5 cosθ -50 =0.

This is a quadratic equation in cosθ. Let me let x = cosθ.

So equation becomes: 100x² +5x -50 =0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-5 ± sqrt(25 + 4*100*50)] / (2*100).

Calculate discriminant: 25 + 4*100*50 =25 +20000=20025.

sqrt(20025)=141.5, because 141^2=19881, 142^2=20164. Wait, 141.5^2 = (141 + 0.5)^2 = 141^2 + 2*141*0.5 +0.25=19881+141+0.25=20022.25. Hmm, but 20025 is 20025. So sqrt(20025)=141.5035 approximately.

So x = [-5 ±141.5035]/200.

We have two solutions:

x1 = (-5 +141.5035)/200 ≈136.5035/200≈0.6825.

x2 = (-5 -141.5035)/200 ≈-146.5035/200≈-0.7325.

But cosθ can't be less than -1, so x2 is acceptable, but let's see. Since θ is the angle from the horizontal, and the cannon is on a truck moving forward, θ is between 0 and 90 degrees, so cosθ is positive. So x must be positive. So we take x ≈0.6825.

So cosθ ≈0.6825 → θ ≈ arccos(0.6825).

Calculating arccos(0.6825): let's see, cos(47 degrees)= approx 0.682. Because cos(45)=~0.707, cos(50)=~0.6428. So 0.6825 is between 45 and 50. Let me check with calculator.

Wait, but maybe I can use a calculator. Alternatively, I can note that 0.6825 is close to 0.6820, which is cos(47 degrees). So θ≈47 degrees.

Looking at the options, option H is 49°, which is close. Alternatively, maybe another approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivative. Let me double-check.

f(θ)=5 sinθ +25 sin(2θ).

f’(θ)=5 cosθ +25*2 cos(2θ) =5 cosθ +50 cos(2θ). So yes, correct.

So the solution is cosθ≈0.6825 → θ≈47 degrees.

Looking at the options, the closest is H:49°, or perhaps another angle. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can approach this differently. Let me think about the optimal angle when there's an initial horizontal velocity.

In projectile motion, the optimal angle isn't always 45 degrees when there's an initial horizontal velocity. The formula for maximum range when there's a horizontal velocity V and launch speed v is given by:

R = (V + v cosθ) * (2 v sinθ)/g.

To find the θ that maximizes R, take derivative with respect to θ and set to zero.

But perhaps a smarter way is to let u = θ, then the range equation is:

R = (V + v cosu) * (2 v sinu)/g.

We can write this as R = (2 v (V + v cosu) sinu)/g.

To maximize R, take derivative dR/du and set to zero.

dR/du = 2v/g [ (V + v cosu) cosu - v sin²u ] =0.

So (V + v cosu) cosu - v sin²u =0.

Expanding: V cosu + v cos²u - v sin²u=0.

Using identity cos²u - sin²u = cos(2u):

V cosu + v cos(2u) =0.

Hmm, that's another approach. Let me see:

V cosu + v cos(2u) =0.

We can use the identity cos(2u)=2 cos²u -1.

So:

V cosu + v (2 cos²u -1) =0.

Rearranging:

v*2 cos²u + V cosu -v =0.

Which is a quadratic in cosu: 2v cos²u + V cosu -v=0.

So in our case, V=5 m/s, v=50 m/s.

So equation becomes:

2*50 cos²u +5 cosu -50=0 → 100 cos²u +5 cosu -50=0.

Which is the same equation as before. So solving for cosu:

cosu = [ -5 ± sqrt(25 + 4*100*50) ]/(2*100) = [ -5 ± sqrt(20025) ]/200.

sqrt(20025)=141.5.

So cosu = ( -5 +141.5 ) /200 ≈136.5/200≈0.6825.

So u≈acos(0.6825)= approx 47 degrees.

But looking at the options, the closest is H:49°, but perhaps another approach.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the optimal angle isn't 45 degrees when the initial horizontal speed is significant compared to the muzzle velocity. Wait, in this case, the truck's speed is 5 m/s, and the cannon's muzzle is 50 m/s, so 5 is much smaller than 50. So perhaps the optimal angle is close to 45 degrees but slightly less.

Wait, but the way the range depends on θ, when there's an initial horizontal velocity, the optimal angle is less than 45 degrees. Because the initial horizontal speed adds to the projectile's horizontal component, so to maximize the product (Vx + v cosθ) * (2 vy), perhaps the optimal θ is less than 45.

Wait, wait, earlier calculation gave θ≈47°, which is close to 45, but higher. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach. Let me think again. When the initial horizontal speed is much smaller than the muzzle velocity, maybe the optimal angle is close to 45 degrees. But perhaps it's better to think of the problem differently.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the combined velocity vector. The ball's velocity relative to the ground is the vector sum of the truck's velocity (5 m/s in x) and the cannon's muzzle velocity (50 m/s at angle θ).

So the total velocity components are:

Vx_total =5 +50 cosθ.

Vy_total=50 sinθ.

The range is Vx_total multiplied by the time of flight, which is (2 Vy_total)/g.

So R= (5 +50 cosθ) * (2 *50 sinθ)/9.8.

To maximize R, take the derivative of R with respect to θ and set to zero.

R= (5 +50 cosθ)(100 sinθ)/9.8.

Let me ignore the constants for easier differentiation. Let me set f(θ) = (5 +50 cosθ) sinθ.

Then f’(θ)= -50 sinθ * sinθ + (5 +50 cosθ) cosθ.

Wait, no, using product rule:

f’(θ)= derivative of (5 +50 cosθ) times sinθ + (5 +50 cosθ) times derivative of sinθ.

So:

= (-50 sinθ) * sinθ + (5 +50 cosθ) * cosθ.

= -50 sin²θ + (5 +50 cosθ) cosθ.

Set f’(θ)=0:

-50 sin²θ +5 cosθ +50 cos²θ=0.

Rearranged:

50 cos²θ +5 cosθ -50 sin²θ=0.

We can replace sin²θ with 1 -cos²θ.

So:

50 cos²θ +5 cosθ -50(1 -cos²θ)=0.

Expanding:

50 cos²θ +5 cosθ -50 +50 cos²θ=0.

Combine like terms:

100 cos²θ +5 cosθ -50=0.

Which is the same quadratic equation as before. So solution cosθ≈0.6825, θ≈47 degrees.

Looking at the options, the closest is H:49°, but that's a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, maybe I should compute arccos(0.6825) more accurately.

Using a calculator, cos(47°)=approx 0.6820, and cos(48°)=approx 0.6691. So 0.6825 is very close to 47°, maybe 47.1 degrees.

But the options don't have 47°, the closest is H:49°, which is a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 45°, but that would be option C.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the maximum range when there's an initial horizontal velocity can be found by considering the optimal angle θ where the derivative is zero, which we've done, leading to θ≈47°, but perhaps the options don't have that, so the closest is H:49°. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the optimal angle is 45°, but that's when there's no initial horizontal velocity.

Wait, but if the truck is moving forward, the optimal angle would be less than 45°, because the horizontal component of the cannon's velocity adds to the truck's speed. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, actually, when you have an initial horizontal velocity, the optimal angle is less than 45°. Because the horizontal speed is already higher, so the optimal trade-off between horizontal and vertical components is lower.

Wait, but in our calculation, we got around 47°, which is higher than 45°, which seems contradictory. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me think again. If the truck is moving at 5 m/s, and the cannon's muzzle is 50 m/s, then the total horizontal velocity is 5 +50 cosθ. The vertical is 50 sinθ.

The time of flight is determined by the vertical component: t= (2 *50 sinθ)/9.8.

So the range R= (5+50 cosθ) * (100 sinθ)/9.8.

We can write this as R= (5 +50 cosθ) * (100 sinθ)/9.8.

Let me try plugging in θ=45°, which is option C.

At θ=45°, cosθ=√2/2≈0.7071, sinθ=√2/2≈0.7071.

So R= (5 +50*0.7071) * (100*0.7071)/9.8.

Calculating:

5 +50*0.7071 ≈5 +35.355≈40.355.

100*0.7071≈70.71.

So R≈40.355 *70.71 /9.8.

40.355 *70.71≈2855.6.

2855.6 /9.8≈291.4 meters.

Now, let's try θ=47°, which is close to our calculation.

cos(47°)=approx 0.6820, sin(47°)=approx 0.7314.

So R=(5 +50*0.6820) * (100 *0.7314)/9.8.

50*0.6820=34.1, so 5+34.1=39.1.

100*0.7314=73.14.

So R=39.1 *73.14 /9.8.

39.1 *73.14≈2855.5.

2855.5 /9.8≈291.4 meters. Wait, same as 45°? That can't be right.

Hmm, maybe I made a miscalculation. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum is around 47°, but perhaps the options don't have that, so the closest is H:49°, but let me check.

Wait, maybe I should calculate R for θ=49°.

cos(49)=approx 0.6561, sin(49)=approx 0.7547.

So R=(5 +50*0.6561) * (100*0.7547)/9.8.

50*0.6561=32.805, so 5+32.805=37.805.

100*0.7547=75.47.

So R=37.805 *75.47 /9.8.

37.805*75.47≈2855.5.

2855.5/9.8≈291.4 meters.

Hmm, same as before. So perhaps the maximum is around 47°, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs around 45°, but in that case, the options have C:45°, which is 45 degrees.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem is that when the truck is moving, the optimal angle might be less than 45°, because the horizontal component is already higher. But our calculation suggests it's around 47°, which is close to 45°, but perhaps the answer is 45°, option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum range is achieved at 45°, but when the truck is moving, the optimal angle is less than 45°, but in our case, the truck's speed is much lower than the cannon's muzzle speed, so the optimal angle is close to 45°, but slightly less.

Wait, but earlier calculation from the derivative gave us around 47°, which is higher than 45°, which seems conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivative approach. Let me re-examine.

We had f’(θ)=5 cosθ +50 cos(2θ)=0.

Wait, perhaps I should use a different approach. Let me consider R as a function of θ and compute its value at different angles to see where the maximum occurs.

Let me compute R for θ=45°, 47°, 49°, and maybe 40° and 50°.

At θ=45°:

cosθ=√2/2≈0.7071, sinθ=√2/2≈0.7071.

R=(5 +50*0.7071)*(2*50*0.7071)/9.8.

= (5 +35.355) * (70.71) /9.8.

=40.355 *70.71 ≈2855.6.

2855.6 /9.8≈291.4 meters.

At θ=47°:

cosθ≈0.6820, sinθ≈0.7314.

R=(5 +50*0.6820)*(2*50*0.7314)/9.8.

= (5 +34.1) *73.14 /9.8.

=39.1 *73.14≈2855.5.

2855.5/9.8≈291.4 meters.

Same as 45°, which suggests that maybe the maximum is around there.

Wait, perhaps the function is flat around that area, so the optimal angle is around 45°, but perhaps the closest option is 45°, option C.

But wait, according to the derivative approach, the optimal angle is around 47°, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the answer is H:49°, but that's a bit higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the maximum range occurs at θ where the derivative is zero, which is approximately 47°, but since that's not an option, perhaps the closest is H:49°.

Wait, but looking back at the options, H is 49°, which is close to 47°, but perhaps the correct approach is to choose 45°, option C.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial approach, and the correct answer is 45°, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach: think about the relative velocity. The cannon is on a truck moving at 5 m/s. The cannon's muzzle speed is 50 m/s relative to the truck. So the ball's speed relative to the ground is 50 m/s at angle θ, plus 5 m/s in the x-direction.

So the ball's velocity components are:

Vx =5 +50 cosθ.

Vy=50 sinθ.

The time of flight is determined by Vy: t= (2 Vy)/g.

So R= Vx * t= (5 +50 cosθ) * (100 sinθ)/9.8.

We can write this as R= (5 +50 cosθ) * (100 sinθ)/9.8.

To find the maximum R, take derivative dR/dθ and set to zero.

Let me set f(θ)=(5 +50 cosθ) sinθ.

f’(θ)= -50 sinθ * sinθ + (5 +50 cosθ) cosθ.

= -50 sin²θ +5 cosθ +50 cos²θ.

Set to zero:

-50 sin²θ +5 cosθ +50 cos²θ=0.

Using sin²θ=1 -cos²θ:

-50(1 -cos²θ) +5 cosθ +50 cos²θ=0.

-50 +50 cos²θ +5 cosθ +50 cos²θ=0.

Combine terms:

100 cos²θ +5 cosθ -50=0.

Which is the same quadratic as before. So cosθ= [ -5 ± sqrt(25 +20000) ] /200.

sqrt(20025)=141.5.

So cosθ= (136.5)/200≈0.6825.

θ=acos(0.6825)= approx 47 degrees.

So the optimal angle is approximately 47 degrees, which isn't exactly any of the options. The closest option is H:49°, but that's a bit higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 45°, but that would be option C, which is 45°, a common angle for maximum range.

Wait, but according to the calculation, it's around 47°, so perhaps the intended answer is H:49°, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, and the correct answer is 45°, option C.

Wait, perhaps another approach: since the truck is moving forward, the effective muzzle velocity in the x-direction is 5 m/s plus 50 cosθ. To maximize the range, the optimal angle when considering the horizontal and vertical components would still be around 45°, but adjusted slightly.

But given the options, the closest is H:49°, but I'm not entirely confident. Another thought: perhaps the maximum occurs when the vertical component is optimized, which is when θ is such that the time of flight is maximized, but that's not necessarily the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 45°, option C, because it's the standard maximum range angle, and the truck's speed is much smaller than the muzzle velocity, so the effect is minimal.

But according to the detailed calculation, it's around 47°, which isn't an option, so perhaps the intended answer is H:49°, but I'm not certain.
</think>

To determine the optimal angle for the cannon to maximize the range of the ball, we analyze the projectile motion relative to the ground. The truck moves forward at 5 m/s, and the cannon has a muzzle velocity of 50 m/s. The ball's velocity relative to the ground is the vector sum of the truck's velocity and the cannon's muzzle velocity.

### Key Equations:
1. **Horizontal Velocity**: \( V_x = 5 + 50 \cos\theta \)
2. **Vertical Velocity**: \( V_y = 50 \sin\theta \)
3. **Time of Flight**: \( t = \frac{2 V_y}{g} = \frac{100 \sin\theta}{9.8} \)
4. **Range**: \( R = V_x \cdot t = (5 + 50 \cos\theta) \cdot \frac{100 \sin\theta}{9.8} \)

To maximize \( R \), we take the derivative of \( R \) with respect to \( \theta \) and set it to zero:
\[
f(\theta) = (5 + 50 \cos\theta) \sin\theta
\]
\[
f'(\theta) = -50 \sin^2\theta + (5 + 50 \cos\theta) \cos\theta = 0
\]
Simplifying and solving the resulting quadratic equation:
\[
100 \cos^2\theta + 5 \cos\theta - 50 = 0
\]
Using the quadratic formula:
\[
\cos\theta = \frac{-5 + \sqrt{20025}}{200} \approx 0.6825
\]
\[
\theta \approx \arccos(0.6825) \approx 47^\circ
\]

### Analysis of Options:
- **45° (Option C)**: The standard maximum range for projectile motion without an initial horizontal velocity. However, with the truck's speed, the optimal angle is slightly higher.
- **47° (Not an Option)**: Closest to the calculated value but not listed.
- **49° (Option H)**: Closest to the calculated value of 47°, making it the best choice among the given options.

### Conclusion:
The optimal angle is approximately 47°, but since this is not an option, the closest available choice is **49° (Option H)**.

Answer: H
