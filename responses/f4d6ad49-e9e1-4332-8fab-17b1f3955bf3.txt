Okay, so I've got this equation here: 14 equals w plus 23. I'm trying to figure out what w is. Hmm, let's see. I remember from algebra that to solve for a variable, I need to get it by itself on one side of the equation. 

So the equation is 14 = w + 23. I think the goal is to isolate w. Right now, w has 23 added to it, so to get w by itself, I should do the opposite operation. The opposite of adding 23 is subtracting 23. 

Wait, so if I subtract 23 from both sides of the equation, that should keep things balanced. Let me write that out. If I subtract 23 from the left side, I get 14 minus 23. On the right side, subtracting 23 from (w + 23) would leave just w. 

So, 14 minus 23 is... let me do the math. 14 minus 20 is 4, and then minus 3 more is 1. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 14 is smaller than 23, so the result should be negative. Let me think again. 23 minus 14 is 9, so 14 minus 23 would be -9. 

So, w equals -9. Let me check the options. Option G is -9, right? So the answer should be G. 

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. If I plug w = -9 back into the original equation, does it hold? Let's see: 14 equals (-9) plus 23. Adding those together, -9 +23 is 14, which matches the left side. Yep, that works. So I'm confident that G is the correct answer.

The equation is 14 = w + 23. To solve for w, subtract 23 from both sides: 14 - 23 = w. This simplifies to w = -9. Checking the options, G is -9. Verifying by substituting back, (-9) + 23 = 14, which is correct. 

Answer: G
