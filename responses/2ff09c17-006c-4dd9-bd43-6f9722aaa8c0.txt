Question:

A 17-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother because she has not had a menstrual period for 6 months. The patient is unconcerned about the lack of menses. Menarche occurred at the age of 12 years, and menses had occurred at regular 28-day intervals until they became irregular 1 year ago. She is a member of her high school gymnastics team. She appears emaciated. She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 40 kg (88 lb); BMI is 15 kg/m2 . Her pulse is 54/min, and blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's amenorrhea?

Options:

A: Polycystic ovarian syndrome
B: Prolactinoma
C: Cushing's syndrome
D: Premature ovarian failure
E: Hyperthyroidism
F: Pregnancy
G: Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
H: Hypothyroidism
I: Turner syndrome

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the cause of this 17-year-old girl's amenorrhea. Let's break down the information given. She hasn't had a period for 6 months, and she's not worried about it. Her menarche was at 12, and her cycles were regular until they became irregular a year ago. She's on the high school gymnastics team, which makes me think she's active. She looks emaciated, which is a clue. Her stats are 163 cm and 40 kg, so BMI is 15, which is way below normal. Her pulse is 54, low, and blood pressure is 80/50, also low.

First, I'll consider the options. amenorrhea can be caused by various factors, including hormonal issues, structural problems, or other systemic conditions.

Looking at the options:

A: PCOS - Usually presents with irregular cycles, not necessarily 6 months without a period. Also, PCOS can cause other symptoms like hirsutism, which isn't mentioned here.

B: Prolactinoma - A pituitary tumor that secretes prolactin. It can cause irregular menses or amenorrhea, but would also present with other symptoms like galactorrhea, which isn't noted here. Plus, her low BMI might not directly relate to this unless it's causing secondary issues.

C: Cushing's - This is more about hypercortisolism, leading to weight gain, especially in the face, and other symptoms like easy bruising. Her weight is low, so this seems less likely.

D: Premature ovarian failure - This would mean her ovaries aren't producing eggs or hormones. She's 17, which is young for this, but possible. However, the symptoms might include other signs like low estrogen, which could affect bone density, but she's not showing other symptoms like hot flashes.

E: Hyperthyroidism - This usually causes weight loss, but also symptoms like palpitations, anxiety, and heat intolerance. Her pulse is 54, which is low, not high as in hyperthyroidism.

F: Pregnancy - Possible, but she's not showing signs like nausea or breast tenderness. Also, she's an athlete, but athletes can get pregnant. However, given her BMI and the lack of concern, maybe less likely unless she's had a missed period for another reason.

G: Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism - This is when the brain (hypothalamus) doesn't send the right signals to the pituitary, which then doesn't stimulate the ovaries. This can cause amenorrhea. It's related to body fat percentage; if she's too low, her body might not prioritize reproduction. Her BMI is 15, which is quite low, so this could be a factor. Irregular cycles turning into amenorrhea fits this.

H: Hypothyroidism - This would cause weight gain, cold intolerance, and fatigue. Her weight is low, so maybe not hypothyroidism unless it's a different presentation, but her pulse is low, which could fit. However, hypothyroidism usually causes constipation, dry skin, etc., which aren't mentioned.

I: Turner syndrome - This is a chromosomal condition where females have only one X chromosome. It can cause Amenorrhea, but other symptoms like short stature, webbed neck, and infertility. She's 163 cm, which is about average, so maybe not. Also, she's had periods before, so Turner might not explain the current issue unless it's a later development.

Putting it together, her low BMI of 15 is a big clue. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is often associated with low body weight and low estrogen, leading to cessation of menses. Her irregular cycles for a year, then stopping, aligns with this. The low pulse and BP could be due to low estrogen affecting the cardiovascular system.

So, the most likely answer is G: Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.

The most likely cause of the patient's amenorrhea is **G: Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism**. This condition is often linked to low body weight and low BMI, which can disrupt normal hormonal signaling, leading to the cessation of menstruation. 

Answer: G
