Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, Bella has all her photos in 8 photo books, and each book has 25 photos. The question is asking which expression shows how to find the total number of photos she has.

Hmm, so I know that when you have multiple groups of something, to find the total, you usually multiply the number of groups by the number in each group. So in this case, each photo book is a group, right? And each group has 25 photos. There are 8 such groups because there are 8 photo books.

So, the total number of photos should be 8 multiplied by 25. Let me think about the options given. Option A is 25 × 8, which is the same as 8 × 25. That makes sense because multiplication is commutative, so the order doesn't matter. 

Let me check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something. Option B is 8 + 25. That would just be adding them together, which doesn't make sense because you're not adding 8 and 25; you're adding eight 25s together. So that's not right. Option C is 25 + 25, which would only give you 50 photos, but Bella has 8 books, so that's way too low.

Option D is 25 × 25. That would be 625, which is way more than the actual number because she only has 8 books. So that's not correct. Option E is 8 – 25, which would give a negative number, which doesn't make sense here. Option F is 25 – 8, which is 17, but again, that's not the total photos. Option G is 25 + 8, which is 33, but that's just adding, not multiplying. 

Options H, I, and J involve division or subtraction, which don't fit the situation. So the only one that makes sense is option A: 25 × 8. That should give the correct total number of photos Bella has.

The correct expression is 25 multiplied by 8, which is option A.
