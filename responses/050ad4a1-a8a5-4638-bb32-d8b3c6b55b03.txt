Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the time-domain response of a network using Fourier transform methods. The system function is given as H(jω) = (j2ω)/(1 + 2jω), and the input is V(t) = cos(t). The Fourier transform of cos(t) is provided as π[δ(ω + 1) + δ(ω - 1)], which makes sense because that's the standard Fourier transform for a cosine function at frequency 1.

First, I remember that in Fourier domain analysis, the output Y(jω) is the product of the system function H(jω) and the input X(jω). So Y(jω) = H(jω) * X(jω). 

Given that X(jω) is π[δ(ω + 1) + δ(ω - 1)], when I multiply this by H(jω), I will get contributions only at ω = 1 and ω = -1. So let's compute H(jω) at these two points.

Starting with ω = 1:
H(j*1) = (j2*1)/(1 + 2j*1) = (2j)/(1 + 2j). I think I need to simplify this. Maybe I'll multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator to make it easier. The denominator's conjugate is (1 - 2j), so:

(2j)(1 - 2j) / [(1 + 2j)(1 - 2j)] = [2j(1) - 4j^2] / [1^2 + (2)^2] because (a+b)(a-b)=a² - b², but since j is involved, wait, actually (1+2j)(1-2j) = 1 - (2j)^2 = 1 - (-4) = 5. So denominator is 5.

Numerator: 2j -4j². Since j²=-1, that becomes 2j +4. So numerator is 4 + 2j. So H(j1) = (4 + 2j)/5.

Similarly, at ω = -1:
H(j*(-1)) = (-2j)/(1 + 2*(-j)) = (-2j)/(1 - 2j). Again, multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + 2j):

(-2j)(1 + 2j) / [(1 - 2j)(1 + 2j)] = [(-2j)(1) -4j²] / [1 +4] (since denominator is 5 again).

Numerator: -2j -4(-1) = -2j +4. So numerator is 4 -2j. So H(j*(-1)) = (4 -2j)/5.

Now, the Fourier transform of the output Y(jω) is H(jω)*X(jω), which is:

Y(jω) = H(jω) * π[δ(ω +1) + δ(ω -1)] = π [ H(j1) δ(ω +1) + H(-j1) δ(ω -1) ]

Wait, no, actually, when ω is -1, it's H(j*(-1)) which is H(-j1), but I think I can write it as H(jω) evaluated at ω=1 and ω=-1.

So, Y(jω) = π [ (4 + 2j)/5 δ(ω +1) + (4 -2j)/5 δ(ω -1) ].

Now, to find y(t), the inverse Fourier transform of Y(jω). Since the Fourier transform of δ(ω ±1) are exponential functions, but when you have δ(ω +1) and δ(ω -1), their inverse transforms are (1/(2π))e^{±jω t} evaluated at ω=±1.

Wait, the inverse Fourier transform formula is y(t) = (1/(2π)) ∫ Y(jω) e^{jω t} dω.

But since Y(jω) has delta functions at ω=1 and ω=-1, the integral becomes the sum of the residues multiplied by e^{jω t} evaluated at those points.

So,

y(t) = (1/(2π)) [ π*(4 + 2j)/5 e^{j(1)t} + π*(4 - 2j)/5 e^{j(-1)t} ]

Simplify this:

The π terms cancel with 1/(2π), so:

y(t) = [ (4 + 2j)/5 e^{j t} + (4 - 2j)/5 e^{-j t} ] / 2

Wait, no. Let me see:

Wait, 1/(2π) times π times each term. So each term becomes (4 + 2j)/5 * (1/(2π)) * π e^{j t} → (4 + 2j)/5 * 1/2 e^{j t}.

Wait, perhaps better to compute each term:

Each δ(ω ±1) contributes (1/(2π)) * Y(j(±1)) * e^{j (±1) t}.

So, the first term is (1/(2π)) * π*(4 + 2j)/5 * e^{j t}, and the second term is (1/(2π)) * π*(4 - 2j)/5 * e^{-j t}.

Simplifying, the π cancels with 1/(2π), leaving each term as (4 + 2j)/5 * (1/2) e^{j t} and (4 -2j)/5 * (1/2) e^{-j t}.

So,

y(t) = [ (4 + 2j)/5 * (e^{j t} + e^{-j t}) ) + (something? Wait no, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recompute.

Wait, no, the second term is (4 -2j)/5 * e^{-j t}, so each term is (4 +2j)/5 * e^{j t} / 2 and (4 -2j)/5 * e^{-j t} /2.

So,

y(t) = (1/2) [ (4 +2j)/5 e^{j t} + (4 -2j)/5 e^{-j t} ]

Factor out 1/5:

y(t) = (1/(2*5)) [ (4 +2j) e^{j t} + (4 -2j) e^{-j t} ]

= (1/10) [ (4 +2j) e^{j t} + (4 -2j) e^{-j t} ]

Now, I can expand each exponential using Euler's formula: e^{j t} = cos t + j sin t, e^{-j t} = cos t - j sin t.

So,

(4 +2j)(cos t + j sin t) = 4 cos t +4 j sin t + 2j cos t + 2j^2 sin t.

But j^2 = -1, so this becomes 4 cos t +4j sin t +2j cos t -2 sin t.

Similarly, (4 -2j)(cos t - j sin t) = 4 cos t -4j sin t -2j cos t + 2j^2 sin t.

Again, j^2 = -1, so it's 4 cos t -4j sin t -2j cos t -2 sin t.

Now, sum both terms:

First term: 4 cos t +4j sin t +2j cos t -2 sin t
Second term: 4 cos t -4j sin t -2j cos t -2 sin t

Adding them together:

cos t terms: 4 +4 =8
sin t terms: (-2) + (-2) =-4
j sin t terms: 4j -4j =0
j cos t terms: 2j -2j=0

So overall sum: 8 cos t -4 sin t.

Multiply by (1/10):

y(t) = (8 cos t -4 sin t)/10 = (4/5) cos t - (2/5) sin t.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is (4/5) cost - (2/5) sint, which matches.

But wait, let me double-check because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the signs.

Wait, when I expanded (4 +2j)(e^{jt}):

=4 cos t +4j sin t +2j cos t + 2j^2 sin t
=4 cos t +4j sin t +2j cos t -2 sin t.

Similarly, (4-2j)(e^{-jt}):

=4 cos t -4j sin t -2j cos t + 2j^2 sin t
=4 cos t -4j sin t -2j cos t -2 sin t.

Adding:

[4 cos t +4 cos t] =8 cos t
[ (4j sin t -4j sin t) ] =0
[ (2j cos t -2j cos t) ] =0
[ (-2 sin t -2 sin t) ] =-4 sin t.

So the sum is 8 cos t -4 sin t. Multiply by (1/10) as before.

So y(t) = (8 cos t -4 sin t)/10 = (4/5) cos t - (2/5) sin t.

Looking at the options, option A is (4/5) cost - (2/5) sin t, which matches.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in calculating H(jω) at ω=1 and ω=-1.

Let me recheck H(jω) at ω=1: H(j1) = (j2*1)/(1 +2j*1) = 2j/(1 +2j). Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 -2j):

(2j)(1 -2j) =2j -4j² =2j +4. Denominator: (1)^2 + (2)^2=1+4=5. So H(j1)= (4 + 2j)/5. Correct.

At ω=-1: H(j*(-1)) = (j2*(-1))/(1 + 2j*(-1))= (-2j)/(1 -2j). Multiply numerator and denominator by (1+2j):

(-2j)(1+2j) =-2j -4j² =-2j +4. Denominator: (1)^2 + (2)^2=5. So H(j(-1))= (4 -2j)/5. Correct.

So the calculations are correct, leading to option A.

The time-domain response is calculated by evaluating the system function at the input frequencies, resulting in the response (4/5)cos(t) - (2/5)sin(t), which corresponds to option A.
