Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me read it again carefully.

Jess scored 18 points during her last basketball game. Each basket she made was worth 2 points. How many baskets did she make?

Hmm, alright. So the question is about basketball points. I know that in basketball, each basket can be worth different points, but the problem says each basket is worth 2 points. So every time she made a basket, she got 2 points.

Alright, so she scored a total of 18 points. If each basket gives her 2 points, then the number of baskets she made would be the total points divided by the points per basket. That makes sense because if you know the total and how much each contributes, you divide to find the number of contributions.

So, mathematically, that would be 18 points divided by 2 points per basket. Let me write that down: 18 ÷ 2 = ?

Calculating that, 18 divided by 2 is 9. So she made 9 baskets. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. Sometimes in basketball, there are different types of shots—like free throws are worth 1 point, and baskets can be 2 or 3 points depending on whether they're inside the arc or not. But the problem specifically says each basket was worth 2 points, so I don't have to worry about 3-pointers or anything else. It's straightforward.

So, each basket is 2 points, total points are 18. Divide 18 by 2 to get the number of baskets. That's 9. Let me check the options again to see which one is 9.

Looking back at the options: A is 5, B is 20, C is 36, D is 6, E is 10, F is 18, G is 12, H is 9, I is 8, J is 16.

So option H is 9. That must be the correct answer. Wait, but let me think again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If she made 9 baskets at 2 points each, that's 9 times 2, which is indeed 18. Yep, that matches the total points given. So I'm confident that H is the right choice.

To determine how many baskets Jess made, divide the total points (18) by the points per basket (2). 

Calculation: 18 ÷ 2 = 9 baskets.

Answer: H

H: 9
