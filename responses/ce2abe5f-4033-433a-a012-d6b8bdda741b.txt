Okay, so I've got this question about Leo's Restaurant purchasing a neon sign, and I need to figure out how much they paid. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the purchase was made on July 1st for $202 with discount terms (3/10), (n/30) R.O.G. Hmm, I remember that discount terms are usually written as something like 3/10, n/30. So, the 3/10 means a 3% discount if paid within 10 days. And n/30 means the net amount is due in 30 days, but without any discount if not paid within the 10 days.

Wait, but when do the discount terms apply? Because the delivery date is July 12th, so the sign was delivered on the 12th. And payment was made on July 20th. So, I need to see whether the payment was made within the discount period.

The discount period is 10 days from the invoice date. The invoice was on July 1, so the 10-day period would end on July 10th. Since the payment was made on July 20th, which is after the 10th, they didn't get the discount. So, the full amount would be due, right?

Wait, but let me double-check. Sometimes, the discount terms can be a bit tricky. The terms are (3/10), (n/30) R.O.G. R.O.G. stands for "Return on Goods," which in this context probably means that the discount applies if payment is made within 10 days of the invoice date, regardless of when the goods are delivered. So, the delivery date is July 12, but the invoice is July 1. So, the 10-day period for the discount runs from July 1 to July 10. Since payment was made on July 20, which is after July 10, they don't qualify for the 3% discount.

So, the total amount paid should be the full amount, which is $202. Looking at the options, option D is $202. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything.

Another thought: Sometimes, the discount period starts from the delivery date, but I don't think that's the case here. The terms are usually based on the invoice date unless specified otherwise. So, the 3/10 refers to 10 days after the invoice date. So yes, July 20 is beyond that.

Therefore, Leo's Restaurant would pay the full amount of $202 without any discount.

The payment was made after the 10-day discount period, so the full amount of $202 is paid.

Answer: D
