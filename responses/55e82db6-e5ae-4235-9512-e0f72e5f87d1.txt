Okay, so I've got this problem here about a solute dissolving in benzene. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem states that at 80°C, an unknown solute dissolves in benzene to form a solution with 1.25 wt.% of the solute. The vapor pressure of the solution is 752.4 mm Hg, and its boiling point is 80.25°C. The normal boiling point of benzene is 80.00°C. We need to find two things: a) the molecular weight of the solute, assuming it's non-volatile, and b) the heat of vaporization per gram for benzene, whose molecular weight is given as 78.

Alright, let's tackle part a) first. Since the solute is non-volatile, the solution's vapor pressure will be lower than that of pure benzene. I remember that Raoult's Law applies here. Raoult's Law states that the partial vapor pressure of the solvent (benzene in this case) is equal to the mole fraction of the solvent multiplied by the vapor pressure of the pure solvent.

So, let's denote:
- P° = vapor pressure of pure benzene at 80°C.
- P = vapor pressure of the solution = 752.4 mm Hg.
- x_solvent = mole fraction of solvent (benzene).
- w_solute = weight percent of solute = 1.25%.

Wait, weight percent is given as 1.25% solute in benzene. So, the solution is mostly benzene. To find the mole fraction, I think I can use the formula:

x_solvent = (100 - w_solute) * (M_benzene) / (w_benzene * M_benzene + w_solute * M_solute)

Wait, no, that might not be right. Alternatively, since the solution is mostly benzene, maybe I can approximate the amount of benzene as almost 100 grams, but considering the small solute addition. Let's think.

The weight percent of solute is 1.25%, so if I take 100 grams of solution, 1.25 grams is solute, and 98.75 grams is benzene.

The molar mass of benzene is 78 g/mol, so moles of benzene = 98.75 / 78 ≈ 1.266 mol.

Molar mass of solute is M (unknown), so moles of solute = 1.25 / M.

The mole fraction of benzene (x) is moles of benzene / (moles benzene + moles solute) = (98.75/78) / [(98.75/78) + (1.25/M)].

Wait, alternatively, since the solute is non-volatile, the solution's vapor pressure is only due to benzene. So, P = x_benzene * P°_benzene.

But I don't know P°_benzene, the vapor pressure of pure benzene at 80°C. Wait, but maybe I can find it using the boiling point elevation. Because the solution's boiling point is slightly higher than benzene's normal boiling point. Oh, wait, the normal boiling point of benzene is 80.00°C, but the solution boils at 80.25°C. So the boiling point has increased by 0.25°C.

Hmm, I remember that the boiling point elevation (ΔTb) is given by ΔTb = K_b * m, where m is the molality of the solute, and K_b is the boiling point elevation constant for benzene.

But wait, I don't know K_b for benzene. Do I need to calculate it? Or maybe I can find it from the given data. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the vapor pressure of pure benzene using the boiling point data of the solution.

Wait, another approach: At the solution's boiling point (80.25°C), the vapor pressure of the solution equals the atmospheric pressure, which is 760 mm Hg. But wait, that's only if it's at the normal boiling point of benzene. But wait, no, because the solution's boiling point is higher, so the vapor pressure at the solution's boiling point would be the same as the atmospheric pressure, which is 760 mm Hg. Wait, but the given vapor pressure of the solution is 752.4 mm Hg at 80°C, which is the same temperature as the normal boiling point of benzene. Wait, that's confusing.

Wait a second, the solution's boiling point is 80.25°C, which is higher than benzene's normal boiling point of 80.00°C. So, the solution boils at 80.25°C, which means that at 80.25°C, the vapor pressure of the solution is equal to the atmospheric pressure, which is 760 mm Hg.

But the problem states that at 80°C, the solution's vapor pressure is 752.4 mm Hg. So, perhaps I can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to relate the change in vapor pressure to the temperature change. The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is:

ln(P2 / P1) = -ΔH_vap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)

But wait, I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can first use the Raoult's Law to find x_benzene, then use the boiling point elevation to find the molality, and then find M_solute.

Wait, let's try this:

1. Using Raoult's Law at 80°C:
P_solution = x_benzene * P°_benzene.

But I don't know P°_benzene. Wait, but at 80°C, benzene's normal vapor pressure is P°, and the solution's vapor pressure is 752.4 mm Hg. So, 752.4 = x_benzene * P°.

But I don't know x_benzene yet. Alternatively, I can express x_benzene in terms of the weight percent.

Wait, weight percent of solute is 1.25%, so weight percent of solvent is 98.75%.

Molar mass of benzene is 78, so moles of benzene in 100g solution is 98.75 / 78 ≈ 1.266 mol.

Moles of solute is 1.25 / M_solute.

So, mole fraction of benzene is (1.266) / (1.266 + (1.25/M_solute)).

But that's getting complicated. Maybe I can make an approximation that the solute is in small quantity, so the mole fraction is approximately 98.75 / 78 divided by (same plus something small). But I'm not sure.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can find the mole fraction using the solution's vapor pressure and the pure benzene's vapor pressure. But I don't have the pure benzene's vapor pressure at 80°C. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe I can find the pure benzene's vapor pressure at 80°C using the solution's data and the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Because the solution's vapor pressure at 80°C is 752.4 mm Hg, and at 80.25°C (its boiling point), the vapor pressure is 760 mm Hg.

Wait, because when the solution boils, its vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure, which is 760 mm Hg. So, the solution's boiling point is 80.25°C, where P=760 mm Hg.

So, I can set up two points: at T1=80°C, P1=752.4 mm Hg, and at T2=80.25°C, P2=760 mm Hg.

Using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

ln(P2/P1) = -ΔH_vap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)

But I don't know ΔH_vap yet. Wait, but I can rearrange it to solve for ΔH_vap.

Alternatively, perhaps I can first find the vapor pressure of pure benzene at 80°C, then use that to find the mole fraction, and from there find the molality, and then the molecular weight.

Wait, another approach: The solution's boiling point is higher than benzene's, so the solute is non-volatile and causes boiling point elevation. The formula for boiling point elevation is:

ΔTb = Kb * m

Where m is the molality of the solute, and Kb is the boiling point elevation constant for benzene.

But I don't have Kb. But perhaps I can find Kb using the data. Wait, but I don't have the molality yet. Hmm.

Wait, let's think again. At 80°C, the solution has a vapor pressure of 752.4 mm Hg. Let's assume that at 80°C, the vapor pressure of pure benzene is P°, and the solution's vapor pressure is x_benzene * P° = 752.4.

But the solution's boiling point is 80.25°C, which is when the solution's vapor pressure reaches 760 mm Hg. So at 80.25°C, the solution's vapor pressure is 760 mm Hg.

So, we can write two equations:

At 80°C: P = 752.4 = x_benzene * P°
At 80.25°C: P = 760 = x_benzene' * P°'

Wait, but P°' is the vapor pressure of pure benzene at 80.25°C. Alternatively, perhaps the pure benzene's vapor pressure decreases with temperature, but I'm not sure. This seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the vapor pressure of pure benzene at 80°C using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, since we have the vapor pressures at two different temperatures.

Wait, the change in vapor pressure (from 80°C to 80.25°C) can be used with the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to find ΔH_vap for benzene. Because the solution's vapor pressure changes with temperature. But wait, the solution's vapor pressure is less than that of pure benzene, so maybe I should only consider the pure benzene's vapor pressure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try a different approach.

First, calculate the mole fraction of benzene in the solution using the 1.25% solute.

If the solution is 1.25% solute, then in 100 g of solution, 1.25 g is solute and 98.75 g is benzene.

Molar mass of benzene is 78 g/mol, so moles of benzene = 98.75 / 78 ≈ 1.266 mol.

Molar mass of solute is M, so moles of solute = 1.25 / M.

Mole fraction of benzene (x_benzene) = moles of benzene / (moles benzene + moles solute) = (1.266) / (1.266 + (1.25/M)).

Now, using Raoult's Law: P_solution = x_benzene * P°_benzene.

But I don't know P°_benzene. However, I can find P°_benzene using the solution's boiling point data.

At the solution's boiling point of 80.25°C, the vapor pressure is 760 mm Hg (atmospheric pressure). So, at 80.25°C, the vapor pressure of the solution is 760 mm Hg.

But wait, the solution's vapor pressure at 80.25°C is 760 mm Hg, which equals x_benzene * P°_benzene(80.25). But P°_benzene varies with temperature. Alternatively, perhaps P°_benzene at 80.25°C is lower than at 80°C because vapor pressure decreases with increasing temperature. Wait, no, vapor pressure increases with temperature. Wait, no, higher temperature means higher vapor pressure. So at 80.25°C, P°_benzene is higher than at 80°C.

Wait, but that complicates things. Maybe I can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to find the vapor pressure of benzene at 80°C, then use that with Raoult's Law.

Let me try that. The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is:

ln(P2 / P1) = (ΔH_vap / R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) / (1)

Wait, no, the correct form is:

ln(P2/P1) = -(ΔH_vap/R) (1/T2 - 1/T1)

Because when T increases, P increases, so the left side should be positive if P2 > P1.

We can use the data from the solution's vapor pressures at two temperatures to find ΔH_vap for benzene.

Wait, but the solution's vapor pressures are given at 80°C (752.4 mm Hg) and at 80.25°C (760 mm Hg). So, for the solution, we can apply the Clausius-Clapeyron equation.

Wait, but the solution's vapor pressure is less than that of pure benzene. Hmm, maybe it's better to find the vapor pressure of pure benzene first. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the change in vapor pressure between 80°C and 80.25°C is due to the solute. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should first find the vapor pressure of pure benzene at 80°C using the solution's data. Let's denote P°_1 as the vapor pressure of pure benzene at T1=80°C, and P1 as the solution's vapor pressure at T1=80°C, which is 752.4 mm Hg.

Similarly, at T2=80.25°C, the solution's vapor pressure is 760 mm Hg, P2=760 mm Hg. But at T2, the vapor pressure of pure benzene would be P°_2.

So, applying Raoult's Law at both temperatures:

At T1: P1 = x_benzene * P°_1
At T2: P2 = x_benzene * P°_2

But I don't know x_benzene, which is the same at both temperatures because the composition doesn't change. Wait, but the composition does change because as the solution boils, some benzene evaporates, but in this case, we're just considering the initial solution's vapor pressure at two different temperatures. Hmm, maybe this isn't the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the mole fraction x_benzene using the solution's data at 80°C and then use the boiling point elevation to find the molality, and then the molecular weight.

Let me try that.

At 80°C, P_solution = 752.4 mm Hg = x_benzene * P°_benzene.

I don't know P°_benzene, but perhaps I can find it using the solution's boiling point data. Wait, the solution's boiling point is 80.25°C, which is when its vapor pressure equals 760 mm Hg. So, at 80.25°C, P_solution = 760 mm Hg = x_benzene * P°_benzene(80.25).

But I don't know P°_benzene at 80.25°C, but I can relate it to P°_benzene at 80°C using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation.

The Clausius-Clapeyron equation for benzene's pure vapor pressure is:

ln(P°2 / P°1) = (ΔH_vap / R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2)

Where:
- P°1 is the vapor pressure of benzene at T1=80°C.
- P°2 is the vapor pressure of benzene at T2=80.25°C.
- ΔH_vap is the heat of vaporization of benzene (part b of the problem).
- R is the gas constant, 8.314 J/mol·K.

But I don't know ΔH_vap yet, which is part b of the problem. Hmm, this is getting circular.

Wait, maybe I can first find x_benzene using the solution's data at 80°C and then use the boiling point elevation to find the molality, and then the molecular weight.

Let me assume that the solution's vapor pressure at 80°C is 752.4 mm Hg, which equals x_benzene * P°_benzene.

But I don't know P°_benzene. Alternatively, perhaps I can find P°_benzene using the solution's boiling point data.

Wait, the solution's boiling point is 80.25°C, which is when its vapor pressure reaches 760 mm Hg. So, at 80.25°C, the solution's vapor pressure is 760 mm Hg, which equals x_benzene * P°_benzene(80.25).

But I don't know P°_benzene(80.25). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the change in vapor pressure from 80°C to 80.25°C is due to the solute's presence. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can find the boiling point elevation (ΔTb) and then use that to find the molality.

ΔTb = Tb_solution - Tb_pure = 80.25 - 80.00 = 0.25°C.

The formula for ΔTb is ΔTb = Kb * m, where m is the molality of the solute.

So, m = ΔTb / Kb.

But I don't know Kb for benzene. However, I can find Kb using the formula Kb = ΔTb / m.

But I don't have m yet. Hmm.

Wait, but I can express m in terms of the solute's molecular weight.

Molality m = moles of solute / kg of solvent.

We have 1.25 g of solute in 98.75 g of benzene. So, kg of solvent is 0.09875 kg.

Moles of solute = 1.25 / M.

So, m = (1.25 / M) / 0.09875 = (1.25) / (0.09875 * M) ≈ 12.66 / M.

So, m = 12.66 / M.

Now, Kb = ΔTb / m = 0.25 / (12.66 / M) ) = (0.25 * M) / 12.66 ≈ (M) / 50.64.

But I don't know Kb yet. However, I can find Kb using the solution's vapor pressure and Raoult's Law.

Wait, another approach: Using the solution's vapor pressure at 80°C, which is 752.4 mm Hg, and the pure benzene's vapor pressure at 80°C (P°), we can write:

752.4 = x_benzene * P°.

But x_benzene is the mole fraction, which I can calculate from the weight percent.

As before, in 100g solution, 1.25g solute and 98.75g benzene.

Moles of benzene = 98.75 / 78 ≈ 1.266 mol.
Moles of solute = 1.25 / M.

So, x_benzene = (1.266) / (1.266 + (1.25/M)).

This seems complicated, but perhaps I can make an approximation. Since the solute is 1.25g in 100g, and M is likely around 100 or so, so moles of solute would be about 0.0125. So, the denominator becomes 1.266 + 0.0125 ≈ 1.2785, so x_benzene ≈ 1.266 / 1.2785 ≈ 0.989.

So, P_solution = x_benzene * P° → 752.4 = 0.989 * P° → P° ≈ 752.4 / 0.989 ≈ 760.7 mm Hg.

Wait, that's interesting. So, the vapor pressure of pure benzene at 80°C is approximately 760.7 mm Hg? But wait, I thought the normal boiling point of benzene is 80°C, which is when the vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure, which is 760 mm Hg. So, this makes sense. So, P° at 80°C is 760 mm Hg.

Wait, that's a key point. So, at the normal boiling point of benzene (80°C), the vapor pressure of pure benzene is 760 mm Hg. Therefore, the solution's vapor pressure at 80°C is 752.4 mm Hg, which is less than 760, indicating that the solution's boiling point is higher than 80°C, which it is (80.25°C).

So, now, using Raoult's Law at 80°C:

752.4 = x_benzene * 760 → x_benzene = 752.4 / 760 ≈ 0.990.

So, x_benzene ≈ 0.990.

Now, calculate x_benzene using the mole fractions.

x_benzene = moles of benzene / (moles benzene + moles solute) = (98.75/78) / [(98.75/78) + (1.25/M)].

We can set this equal to 0.990 and solve for M.

Let me compute (98.75/78) ≈ 1.266.

So, 1.266 / (1.266 + (1.25/M)) = 0.990.

Multiply both sides by denominator:

1.266 = 0.990 * (1.266 + 1.25/M).

Divide both sides by 0.990:

1.266 / 0.990 ≈ 1.2788 = 1.266 + (1.25/M).

Subtract 1.266 from both sides:

1.2788 - 1.266 ≈ 0.0128 = 1.25/M.

So, M ≈ 1.25 / 0.0128 ≈ 97.66 g/mol.

Hmm, that's approximately 98 g/mol. Looking at the options, option J has M≈98 and heat of vaporization 115 cal/g, but option I has M≈96.9 and 128 cal/g. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, let me re-calculate:

x_benzene = 0.990.

So,

1.266 / (1.266 + (1.25/M)) = 0.990.

Multiply denominator both sides:

1.266 = 0.990*(1.266 + 1.25/M).

Compute 0.990 * 1.266 ≈ 1.25334.

So,

1.266 = 1.25334 + (0.990 * 1.25)/M.

Subtract 1.25334 from both sides:

1.266 - 1.25334 ≈ 0.01266 = (1.2375)/M.

So, M ≈ 1.2375 / 0.01266 ≈ 97.75 g/mol.

So, around 97.75, which is approximately 98. So, looking at the options, J is 98, but option I is 96.9. Hmm, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let's compute more accurately.

After:

1.266 - 1.25334 = 0.01266.

So,

0.01266 = 1.2375 / M → M = 1.2375 / 0.01266 ≈ 97.75 g/mol.

So, approximately 97.75, which is close to 98. So, option J is 98, but option I is 96.9. Hmmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me check the initial steps again.

Wait, P°_benzene at 80°C is 760 mm Hg, correct. So, solution's vapor pressure at 80°C is 752.4 mm Hg, so x_benzene = 752.4 / 760 ≈ 0.990.

Then, x_benzene = (moles benzene) / (moles benzene + moles solute) = 1.266 / (1.266 + (1.25/M)).

Set equal to 0.990:

1.266 / (1.266 + 1.25/M) = 0.990.

Cross-multiplying:

1.266 = 0.990*(1.266 + 1.25/M).

Compute 0.990 * 1.266:

0.990 * 1.266 = 1.25234.

So,

1.266 = 1.25234 + (0.990 * 1.25)/M.

Subtract 1.25234:

1.266 - 1.25234 = 0.01366 = (1.2375)/M.

So,

M = 1.2375 / 0.01366 ≈ 90.48 g/mol.

Wait, that's around 90.5. Hmm, that's different from before. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let's recompute 0.990 * 1.266.

0.990 * 1.266 = (1 - 0.01) * 1.266 = 1.266 - 0.01266 = 1.25334.

So,

1.266 = 1.25334 + (1.2375)/M.

Subtract:

1.266 - 1.25334 = 0.01266.

So,

0.01266 = 1.2375 / M → M = 1.2375 / 0.01266 ≈ 97.75 g/mol.

Wait, so the correct value is around 97.75, which is approximately 98. So, why did I get 90 earlier? I must have made a mistake in the subtraction.

Wait, 1.266 - 1.25334 = 0.01266. So,

0.01266 = 1.2375 / M → M ≈ 97.75.

So, the molecular weight is approximately 98 g/mol, which matches option J.

Wait, but looking back, option I is 96.9, which is close. Maybe I should consider more precise calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more accurate values without approximating.

Let me re-calculate without approximations.

x_benzene = (98.75/78) / [(98.75/78) + (1.25/M)].

Compute 98.75/78:

98.75 ÷ 78 = 1.266025641 mol.

So,

x_benzene = 1.266025641 / (1.266025641 + (1.25/M)).

Set equal to 752.4 / 760 = 0.990.

So,

1.266025641 / (1.266025641 + (1.25/M)) = 0.990.

Multiply both sides by denominator:

1.266025641 = 0.990 * (1.266025641 + 1.25/M).

Divide both sides by 0.990:

1.266025641 / 0.990 ≈ 1.278813779 = 1.266025641 + 1.25/M.

Subtract 1.266025641:

1.278813779 - 1.266025641 ≈ 0.012788138 = 1.25/M.

So,

M = 1.25 / 0.012788138 ≈ 97.75 g/mol.

So, approximately 97.75, which is about 98. So, option J is M≈98 and heat of vaporization 115 cal/g.

But wait, part b is the heat of vaporization per gram for benzene. The molecular weight of benzene is 78 g/mol, so per gram, it's ΔH_vap / 78.

Wait, but how do I find ΔH_vap? I think I can use the boiling point elevation data.

Wait, the boiling point elevation ΔTb is 0.25°C. The formula is ΔTb = Kb * m.

But Kb for benzene is known, I think. Alternatively, Kb can be calculated using the formula Kb = ΔTb / m.

But I can also find Kb using the formula Kb = (ΔTb) / (moles solute / kg solvent).

Wait, but I don't have Kb. Alternatively, perhaps I can find it using the solution's vapor pressure and the pure benzene's vapor pressure.

Wait, another approach: The solution's vapor pressure is lower than that of pure benzene, so the presence of the non-volatile solute causes the lowering. The lowering can be expressed as ΔP = P° - P = x_benzene * P° - P.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the equation for vapor pressure lowering:

ΔP = P° - P = (moles solute / moles solvent) * P°.

So,

ΔP = (n_solute / n_solvent) * P°.

We have:

ΔP = 760 - 752.4 = 7.6 mm Hg.

n_solute = 1.25 / M.

n_solvent = 98.75 / 78 ≈ 1.266025641 mol.

So,

7.6 = ( (1.25/M) / 1.266025641 ) * 760.

Solve for M:

7.6 = (1.25 / (M * 1.266025641)) * 760.

Multiply both sides by M * 1.266025641:

7.6 * M * 1.266025641 = 1.25 * 760.

Compute RHS: 1.25 * 760 = 950.

So,

7.6 * M * 1.266025641 = 950.

Compute 7.6 * 1.266025641 ≈ 9.62176.

So,

9.62176 * M = 950 → M ≈ 950 / 9.62176 ≈ 98.69 g/mol.

Hmm, that's approximately 98.7, which aligns with option J (98).

Now, part b: the heat of vaporization (ΔH_vap) per gram of benzene.

Benzene's molecular weight is 78 g/mol. So, per gram, it's ΔH_vap / 78.

But how do I find ΔH_vap?

I think I can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation between the two temperatures where the solution's vapor pressures are known.

The solution's vapor pressure at 80°C is 752.4 mm Hg, and at 80.25°C it's 760 mm Hg.

The Clausius-Clapeyron equation for the solution is:

ln(P2/P1) = -(ΔH_vap_solution / R) * (1/T2 - 1/T1).

But wait, the solution's vapor pressure is due to benzene only, so the ΔH_vap for the solution is the same as that of benzene, assuming the solute doesn't affect it much.

So,

ln(760 / 752.4) = -(ΔH_vap / R) * (1/80.25 - 1/80).

But wait, the temperatures must be in Kelvin.

T1 = 80°C = 353.15 K.

T2 = 80.25°C = 353.40 K.

Compute the left side:

ln(760/752.4) ≈ ln(1.00994) ≈ 0.00990.

Right side:

-(ΔH_vap / R) * (1/353.40 - 1/353.15) → -(ΔH_vap / 8.314) * ( (353.15 - 353.40) / (353.15 * 353.40) )).

Compute denominator: 353.15 * 353.40 ≈ (353.275)^2 ≈ but wait, the difference is small.

Compute numerator: 353.15 - 353.40 = -0.25.

So,

(1/353.40 - 1/353.15) = (353.15 - 353.40) / (353.15 * 353.40) ) → (-0.25) / (approx 124,600) ≈ -2.006e-6.

So,

ln(P2/P1) ≈ 0.00990 = -(ΔH_vap / 8.314) * (-2.006e-6).

Which simplifies to:

0.00990 = (ΔH_vap / 8.314) * 2.006e-6.

Solve for ΔH_vap:

ΔH_vap = (0.00990 * 8.314) / (2.006e-6).

Calculate numerator: 0.00990 * 8.314 ≈ 0.0823086.

So,

ΔH_vap ≈ 0.0823086 / 2.006e-6 ≈ 41,030 J/mol → 41.03 kJ/mol.

Convert to cal/mol: 41.03 kJ/mol * (1 cal / 4.184 J) ≈ 41,030 / 4.184 ≈ 9,800 cal/mol.

Now, per gram: 9,800 cal/mol / 78 g/mol ≈ 125.64 cal/g.

Looking at the options, option B has 125 cal/g, but the molecular weight there is 105, which doesn't match. Option I has 128 cal/g, which is close. Wait, but our calculated M is around 98, which matches option J, which has 115 cal/g, but our calculated ΔH_vap is around 125.6 cal/g.

Hmm, that suggests that the correct option would have M≈98 and ΔH_vap≈125 cal/g. But looking at the options, option B has M=105 and ΔH=125, option I has M=96.9 and ΔH=128, and option J has M=98 and ΔH=115.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ΔH_vap. Let me double-check.

Wait, the calculation:

ln(760/752.4) ≈ 0.00990.

Then,

0.00990 = (ΔH_vap / 8.314) * (2.006e-6).

So,

ΔH_vap = (0.00990 * 8.314) / (2.006e-6).

Calculating numerator: 0.00990 *8.314 ≈ 0.0823.

Denominator: 2.006e-6.

So,

ΔH_vap ≈ 0.0823 / 2.006e-6 ≈ 41,030 J/mol.

Which is 41.03 kJ/mol.

Convert to cal/mol: 41.03 kJ/mol * (1000 J/1 kJ) * (1 cal/4.184 J) ≈ 41,030 * 1000 /4.184 ≈ no, wait, 41,030 J is 41.03 kJ. So,

41.03 kJ/mol = 41,030 J/mol → 41,030 / 4.184 ≈ 9,800 cal/mol.

Per gram: 9,800 / 78 ≈ 125.64 cal/g.

So, around 125.6 cal/g.

Looking back at the options, option B has 125 cal/g but M=105, which doesn't match our calculated M≈98. Option I has M≈96.9 and ΔH=128, which is close to our calculated ΔH. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the M calculation.

Wait, when I calculated M using the vapor pressure method, I got around 98, but using the boiling point elevation, perhaps I get a different M.

Wait, earlier when I used the vapor pressure lowering method, I got M≈98.7, which aligns with option J's M=98. But when using Raoult's Law, I got M≈97.75, which is approximately 98.

But the heat of vaporization I calculated is around 125.6 cal/g, which isn't present in the options. The closest is option B (125 cal/g, M=105) and option I (128 cal/g, M≈96.9).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ΔH_vap. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I should use the solution's vapor pressure data to find ΔH_vap.

Wait, the solution's vapor pressure at 80°C is 752.4 mm Hg, and at 80.25°C it's 760 mm Hg.

Using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation for benzene's vapor pressure:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap/R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2).

Wait, because for pure benzene, P2 and P1 are its vapor pressures at T2 and T1.

So,

ln(760/752.4) = (ΔH_vap / R) * (1/80 - 1/80.25) [in °C, converted to K].

Wait, no, T must be in Kelvin.

T1 = 80°C = 353.15 K.

T2 = 80.25°C = 353.40 K.

So,

ln(760/752.4) ≈ 0.00990 = (ΔH_vap / 8.314) * (1/353.15 - 1/353.40).

Compute (1/353.15 - 1/353.40) = (353.40 - 353.15) / (353.15 * 353.40) ) = 0.25 / (353.15 * 353.40) ≈ 0.25 / 124,674 ≈ 2.005e-6.

So,

0.00990 = (ΔH_vap / 8.314) * 2.005e-6.

Solving for ΔH_vap:

ΔH_vap = (0.00990 * 8.314) / (2.005e-6) ≈ (0.082309) / 2.005e-6 ≈ 41,050 J/mol → 41.05 kJ/mol.

Convert to cal/mol: 41.05 kJ/mol * (1000 J/1 kJ) * (1 cal/4.184 J) ≈ 41,050,000 /4.184 ≈ 9,808 cal/mol.

Per gram: 9,808 / 78 ≈ 125.74 cal/g.

So, approximately 125.7 cal/g.

Looking back at the options, the closest is option B: M=105, H=125. But our M is around 98, so perhaps none of the options perfectly match. However, option J has M=98 and H=115, which is a bit off, and option I has M=96.9 and H=128.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of M. Let me try another approach.

Alternative approach for M:

We have the solution's vapor pressure at 80°C: 752.4 mm Hg.

Using Raoult's Law: P = x_benzene * P°.

x_benzene = (moles benzene) / (moles benzene + moles solute).

We have:

moles benzene = 98.75 /78 ≈ 1.266 mol.

moles solute = 1.25 / M.

So,

x_benzene = 1.266 / (1.266 + 1.25/M).

P = x_benzene * 760 = 752.4.

So,

x_benzene = 752.4 / 760 ≈ 0.990.

Set up the equation:

1.266 / (1.266 + 1.25/M) = 0.990.

Multiply both sides by denominator:

1.266 = 0.990*(1.266 + 1.25/M).

Divide by 0.990:

1.2788 = 1.266 + 1.25/M.

Subtract 1.266:

0.0128 = 1.25/M → M = 1.25 / 0.0128 ≈ 97.66 g/mol.

So, M≈97.7, which is approximately 98.

Now, for the heat of vaporization, we have approximately 125.7 cal/g.

Looking at the options, the only option with M≈98 is J (98, 115 cal/g), but that's not matching the calculated 125.7. However, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the solution's vapor pressure data is for the solution, but the ΔH_vap is for pure benzene, which can be found using its normal boiling point.

Wait, benzene's normal boiling point is 80°C, at which its vapor pressure is 760 mm Hg. Using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation for pure benzene:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap/R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2).

If we take two points close to the boiling point, but I don't have another data point. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the standard ΔH_vap for benzene, which is approximately 30.8 kJ/mol (I think), but that might not be accurate.

Wait, 30.8 kJ/mol is about 7340 cal/mol. Divided by 78 g/mol, that gives about 94.1 cal/g. But none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the data we have. Given that I'm getting ΔH_vap ≈125.7 cal/g, but the options don't have that with M≈98, perhaps the closest option is J, but it's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate Kb using the boiling point elevation and then find ΔH_vap from Kb.

Kb for benzene can be calculated using the formula Kb = ΔTb / (m).

We have ΔTb=0.25°C, and m = moles solute / kg solvent.

m = (1.25/M) / 0.09875 ≈ 12.66 / M.

So, Kb = 0.25 / (12.66 / M) ) = (0.25 * M) / 12.66 ≈ (M) / 50.64.

But Kb can also be calculated using the formula Kb = (ΔTb) / (ΔP/P°) ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, Kb for benzene is known to be approximately 2.53 K·kg/mol. Wait, I think that's right. Let me check.

Yes, the boiling point elevation constant (Kb) for benzene is approximately 2.53 K·kg/mol.

So, Kb = 2.53 K·kg/mol.

Then, using Kb = ΔTb / m:

m = ΔTb / Kb = 0.25°C / 2.53 K·kg/mol ≈ 0.0988 mol/kg.

But m = (1.25/M) / 0.09875 ≈ 12.66 / M.

So,

12.66 / M ≈ 0.0988 → M ≈ 12.66 / 0.0988 ≈ 128 g/mol.

Wait, that's conflicting with the earlier calculation. Hmm, this suggests M≈128, which is not matching any of the options. I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should use the correct Kb value. Let me check: Kb for benzene is indeed around 2.53 K·kg/mol.

So, with Kb=2.53, and ΔTb=0.25,

m = 0.25 / 2.53 ≈ 0.0988 mol/kg.

But m = (moles solute) / kg solvent = (1.25/M) / 0.09875 ≈ 12.66 / M.

So,

12.66 / M = 0.0988 → M ≈ 12.66 / 0.0988 ≈ 128 g/mol.

But this contradicts the earlier calculation of M≈98. So, there must be a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should not use Kb because the solute is non-volatile, and the solution's vapor pressure is lower than that of benzene. Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach using Raoult's Law is correct, giving M≈98, and the ΔH_vap≈125 cal/g, but none of the options match exactly.

Looking back at the options, option I is M≈96.9, ΔH=128, which is close to my calculated M≈98 and ΔH≈125.7. So, perhaps option I is the intended answer, considering possible rounding.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ΔH_vap. Let me recheck.

Using the correct Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2).

P1=752.4 mm Hg at T1=353.15 K.

P2=760 mm Hg at T2=353.40 K.

ΔH_vap is for benzene.

So,

ln(760/752.4) = (ΔH_vap / 8.314) (1/353.15 - 1/353.40).

Calculate the left side:

760/752.4 ≈ 1.00994 → ln(1.00994) ≈ 0.00990.

Right side:

(ΔH_vap /8.314) * ( (353.40 - 353.15) ) / (353.15 * 353.40) )

Which is:

(ΔH_vap /8.314) * (0.25) / (353.15 *353.40) )

Compute denominator: 353.15 *353.40 ≈ 124,674.

So,

0.00990 = (ΔH_vap /8.314) * (0.25 / 124,674) → (ΔH_vap /8.314) * (2.005e-6).

Thus,

ΔH_vap ≈ (0.00990 *8.314) / (2.005e-6) ≈ (0.0823) / (2.005e-6) ≈ 41,050 J/mol → 41.05 kJ/mol.

Convert to cal/mol: 41,050 J/mol * (1 cal/4.184 J) ≈ 9,808 cal/mol.

Per gram: 9,808 /78 ≈ 125.7 cal/g.

So, the calculated ΔH_vap is approximately 125.7 cal/g.

But looking at the options, only option B has 125 cal/g, but with M=105, which doesn't match our M calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution's vapor pressure data is used for benzene, leading to a different ΔH_vap. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the solution's data to find the heat of vaporization.

But I'm getting stuck here. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the closest option, which is option J: M≈98 and ΔH=115 cal/g, but that's not matching the calculated 125.7. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I: M≈96.9 and ΔH=128 cal/g.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the M calculation. Let me try using Kb=2.53 to find M.

Kb=2.53, ΔTb=0.25.

m = 0.25 /2.53 ≈ 0.0988 mol/kg.

m = (1.25/M) / 0.09875 ≈ 12.66 / M.

Set equal:

12.66 / M = 0.0988 → M ≈ 12.66 / 0.0988 ≈ 128 g/mol.

But this contradicts the earlier M≈98. So, perhaps the mistake is in assuming Kb=2.53, but maybe I should calculate Kb from the solution's data.

Wait, Kb can be calculated as Kb = ΔTb / m.

But m = (1.25/M) / 0.09875 ≈ 12.66 / M.

So,

Kb = 0.25 / (12.66 / M) ) = (0.25 * M) / 12.66 ≈ M / 50.64.

But I don't know Kb yet.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find Kb using the solution's vapor pressure data.

Wait, maybe I should give up and go with the initial calculation of M≈98 and ΔH≈125.7, but since none of the options match perfectly, perhaps the intended answer is option I: M≈96.9 and ΔH=128 cal/g.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of M. Let me try using the exact values without rounding.

M = 1.25 / ( (752.4/760) - 1) * (1.266 / (1.266 + 1.25/M )).

Wait, perhaps not. I think I've spent enough time, and the closest option is J: M=98, H=115.

But wait, the calculated H is 125.7, which is closer to option B's H=125, but M=105 doesn't match. So, perhaps the correct answer is option I: M≈96.9, H=128.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option I, given that M is around 97 and H is around 125-128, which is close.
</think>

The problem involves determining the molecular weight of a non-volatile solute dissolved in benzene and the heat of vaporization (per gram) of benzene. The solution's vapor pressure at 80°C is 752.4 mm Hg, and its boiling point is 80.25°C, while benzene's normal boiling point is 80.00°C. Using Raoult's Law and the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, the molecular weight of the solute was calculated to be approximately 98 g/mol, and the heat of vaporization of benzene was found to be around 125.7 cal/g. Among the given options, the closest match is **option J**, which lists the molecular weight as approximately 98 g/mol and the heat of vaporization as 115 cal/g. However, due to rounding and potential approximations in the calculations, **option I** (M ≈ 96.9, H = 128 cal/g) is also a reasonable choice.

ANSWER: J
