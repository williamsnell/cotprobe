Okay, so I've got this question about Morse code, and I need to figure out how many distinct symbols can be represented using sequences of 1, 2, 3, or 4 dots and dashes. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that Morse code uses two symbols: dots (.) and dashes (-). Each symbol is a sequence of these. So for each position in the sequence, there are two possible choices: dot or dash.

The question is asking about sequences of length 1, 2, 3, or 4. So I need to calculate the number of possible sequences for each length and then add them all together.

Let me start with sequences of length 1. Since each position can be a dot or dash, there are 2 possibilities. So for n=1, it's 2^1 = 2.

Next, for sequences of length 2. Each of the two positions can independently be a dot or dash. So that's 2 options for the first, 2 for the second. So 2 * 2 = 4. So for n=2, it's 2^2 =4.

Then, sequences of length 3. Similarly, each of the three positions can be either a dot or dash. So 2 * 2 * 2 = 8. So 2^3=8.

Now for sequences of length 4. That's four positions, each with two choices. So 2^4 = 16.

Wait, but the question says sequences of 1, 2, 3, or 4 total dots and/or dashes. So I need to add up all the possibilities for each length.

So adding them up: 2 (for 1) + 4 (for 2) +8 (for 3) +16 (for 4) = 2+4=6, 6+8=14, 14+16=30.

Wait, so total is 30. Let me double-check that math. 2+4 is 6, plus 8 is 14, plus 16 is 30. Yep.

Looking at the options, E is 30. So the answer should be E.

The number of distinct symbols is calculated by summing the possibilities for each sequence length: 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30.

Answer: E
