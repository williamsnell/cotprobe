Alright, I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about cycads. The question is asking what unusual feature makes cycads a remarkable group among seed plants. Let's go through the options one by one.

Option A says they have flowers that bloom for several years before producing seeds. Wait, I think cycads don't even produce flowers. I remember that cycads are gymnosperms, which have cones instead of flowers. So A might not be correct.

Option B mentions a unique leaf structure. Cycads do have distinctive leaves; they're often described as having a "palm-like" appearance. But I'm not sure if this is the most unusual feature compared to other options.

Option C says they can survive in extremely cold climates. I think cycads are more tropical and subtropical plants. They might not handle very cold climates well, so C might not be right.

Option D states they produce large seeds. While cycads do have relatively large seeds, I'm not sure if that's the unique feature that makes them remarkable. Other plants also produce large seeds.

Option E claims their seeds can remain dormant for up to a century before germinating. That's interesting because some plant seeds do have long dormancy periods, but I'm not certain if cycads are known for such a long time.

Option F suggests they can move their leaves towards the sun. I don't recall cycads having this ability. That sounds more like something like sunflowers, which track the sun, but cycads don't do that as far as I know.

Option G says they form motile, swimming sperm within their pollen tubes. Hmm, this rings a bell. I remember that in gymnosperms, the sperm are actually motile and swim to the egg. In angiosperms, pollen tubes do the job. So cycads, being gymnosperms, might have this feature, which is unusual compared to other seed plants.

Option H mentions they can photosynthesize at night. Some plants can do this, like certain succulents, but I'm not sure if cycads are known for it. They might not be the only ones.

Option I states they exhibit true secondary growth similar to woody trees. Secondary growth is about producing new xylem and phloem, which leads to thickening. I think cycads don't do this; instead, they have a different growth habit, so I might rule out I.

Option J claims they're the only seed plants capable of asexual reproduction. I don't think that's true. Many plants can reproduce asexually, like through cuttings or bulbs, so J is likely incorrect.

So, putting it all together, the key feature is the motile sperm in their pollen tubes. That's a unique trait of gymnosperms, making G the correct answer.

The unusual feature of cycads that makes them remarkable among seed plants is their ability to form motile, swimming sperm within their pollen tubes, a characteristic shared with other gymnosperms.

Answer: G
