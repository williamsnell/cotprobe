Okay, so I've got this question about Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) outcomes as per Wood (1991). I'm a bit rusty on my CSR theories, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Wood is a key author in the field of CSR. His work, particularly from 1991, outlines different aspects of how companies engage in CSR. The question is asking about the three outcomes he identified.

Looking at the options, each one lists three terms starting with "Social" followed by a noun. I need to recall what Wood's model includes. I think he talked about three main outcomes: social policies, social programmes, and social impacts. Wait, but let me make sure.

Wait, I might be mixing this up with other models. Another approach: let's think about what each option presents. Option J is "Social policies, Social programmes and Social impacts." That sounds familiar. I recall that Wood's model includes these three categories as the outcomes of CSR. Social policies would refer to the formal policies a company adopts, social programmes are the actual initiatives they run, and social impacts are the results or effects of those programmes.

Looking at the other options: Option A has social impacts, which is correct, but the other two are policies and responsibility. I think responsibility is more about the concept rather than an outcome. Option C has audits instead of programmes, which I'm not sure about. Option E has evaluations and impacts, but I don't think evaluations are part of the three outcomes. Option H has assessments and impacts, but again, assessments might not be the same as programmes.

So, putting it together, the correct answer should be Option J: Social policies, Social programmes, and Social impacts.
