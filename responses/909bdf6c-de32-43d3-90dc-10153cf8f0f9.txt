Question:

A baker made 232 muffins. He sent 190 of the muffins to a local hotel. He will put the rest of the muffins in boxes. Each box can hold 6 muffins. Which equation can be used to find 6, the number of boxes the baker will need?

Options:

A: (232 - 190)x6=b
B: (232 + 190)/6x190=b
C: (232 - 190)x6+190=b
D: (232 - 190)x6/190=b
E: 6/(232 - 190)=b
F: (232 - 190)/6=b
G: (232 x 190)/6=b
H: (232 + 190)x6=b
I: (232 + 190)/6=b
J: (232 x 190)x6=b

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which equation the baker would use to find out how many boxes he needs. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The baker made 232 muffins in total. He sent 190 of them to a local hotel. So, the first thing I should do is subtract the number he sent from the total to find out how many are left. That makes sense because he can only box the remaining muffins.

So, 232 minus 190 equals... let me calculate that. 232 - 190 is 42. So, the baker has 42 muffins left to put into boxes.

Each box can hold 6 muffins. Now, the question is, how many boxes does he need? To find that, I should divide the number of muffins left by the number each box can hold. So that would be 42 divided by 6.

Wait, but I'm looking at the options given, and none of them directly show 42 divided by 6. Hmm. Let me check the options again.

Looking at option F: (232 - 190)/6 = b. That looks like exactly what I thought. Because 232-190 is 42, then divided by 6 gives the number of boxes. So F seems correct.

But just to make sure, let me go through the other options quickly.

Option A: (232-190)*6 = b. That would multiply the remaining muffins by 6, which doesn't make sense because you want to know how many boxes, not how many muffins you'd get if you multiplied.

Option B: (232+190)/6*190 = b. Adding 232 and 190 would give a number higher than the total muffins, which doesn't fit the problem. Plus, there's a multiplication by 190 at the end, which is confusing.

Option C: (232-190)*6 +190 = b. Again, multiplying the remaining muffins by 6 and then adding 190. That doesn't seem right because we're not adding more muffins, just dividing.

Option D: (232-190)*6 /190 = b. That's a division by 190 at the end, which doesn't align with the problem. We're trying to find boxes for the remaining muffins, not relating to the 190 sent.

Option E: 6/(232-190) = b. That's 6 divided by 42, which would give a fraction less than 1, which isn't the case since you can't have a fraction of a box here.

Option G: (232*190)/6 = b. That would be multiplying the sent muffins by the total and then dividing by 6, which doesn't make sense because we're only concerned with the remaining muffins.

Option H: (232 +190)*6 = b. That's adding the sent muffins to the total and then multiplying by 6, which would give a much larger number than needed.

Option I: (232 +190)/6 = b. Adds the numbers and divides, but that's more than the total muffins, so it's incorrect.

Option J: (232*190)*6 = b. That's a huge number, way beyond what we need.

So, after reviewing all options, the only one that makes sense is option F: (232 -190)/6 = b. This correctly calculates the remaining muffins and divides by the box capacity to find the number of boxes needed.

The baker has 42 muffins left after sending 190 to the hotel. Dividing this by 6 gives the number of boxes needed. The correct equation is (232 - 190)/6 = b.
