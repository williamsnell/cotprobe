Question:

A woman who was three months pregnant enrolled in a pre-natal and post-natal exercise program at the local gymnasium. The contract signed by the woman was to last for one year and called upon the woman to pay $2,000 in quarterly payments of $500. The contract also specified that all fees were non-refundable. Upon signing the contract, the woman made her first payment of $500 and started classes the next day. The woman attended classes on a regular basis for the next three months. At the end of the three-month period, the woman was involved in an automobile accident. Although she was not seriously injured, her doctor advised the woman that she needed complete rest. Her doctor told her to avoid strenuous activity and advised her to discontinue her pre-natal exercise classes. One week later, the woman received a billing notice from the gymnasium, indicating that her second installment payment of $500 was past due. She immediately telephoned the manager of the gymnasium and informed him that she would not be attending any further classes because of her accident. Also, the woman said she did not feel obligated to make any additional payments. Which of the following most accurately describes the woman's duty to pay the gymnasium the second installment fee of $500?

Options:

A: It would not be excused, because the woman did not negotiate a clause in the contract that would allow for cancellation in the event of a health emergency.
B: It would not be excused, because the woman voluntarily entered into the contract knowing that it was non-refundable.
C: It would be excused, because the essential purpose of the contract was frustrated.
D: It would not be excused, because the woman's inability to attend the classes does not affect the gymnasium's ability to provide them.
E: It would be excused, because the accident was an unforeseen event that made it impossible for her to continue the classes.
F: It would be excused, because the woman's health conditions changed due to no fault of her own.
G: It would not be excused, because the contract stipulated that no fees would be refundable.
H: It would be not excused, because her covenant to make the installment payment is also enforceable as a condition precedent.
I: It would be excused, because of impossibility of performance.
J: It would not be excused, as the gymnasium offered services that the woman could no longer use due to personal reasons.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about whether the woman has to pay the second installment of $500 to the gym after she had an accident and her doctor told her to stop attending classes. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, the contract is a one-year agreement for a prenatal and postnatal exercise program. She's paying $500 quarterly, so four payments of $500 each. The contract says all fees are non-refundable. She made the first payment and attended classes regularly for three months. Then she had an accident, wasn't seriously injured, but her doctor told her to rest and avoid strenuous activity, so she had to stop the classes.

The question is about her duty to pay the second installment. So, options are A to J, each giving a different reason why she might or might not have to pay.

Let me think about the contract terms. The contract is non-refundable, so generally, that would mean she can't get her money back. But the question is about her obligation to make the next payment, not about a refund. So, non-refundable doesn't directly speak to whether she has to pay future installments, but it might influence the enforceability.

She's arguing that she shouldn't have to pay because of her health issue. So, I'm thinking about the legal principles here. There's something called "impossibility of performance" or "frustration of purpose." Those are contract law concepts where if an unforeseen event makes it impossible to fulfill the contract or destroys the main purpose, the obligations may be discharged.

In this case, the woman's doctor told her she couldn't attend the classes anymore because of her health. So, can she use impossibility or frustration of purpose as a defense?

Impossibility of performance is when something makes it impossible to perform the contract. For example, if the gym burned down, they couldn't provide classes. But here, the woman can't attend because of her health. Is that impossibility? Or is it more about her personal circumstances making it impossible for her to perform?

Frustration of purpose is when the main reason for entering the contract is frustrated. So, if the purpose of the contract is for her to get fit during pregnancy, and an accident makes that impossible, maybe that applies. But frustration of purpose is a high bar; it requires that the event was not the fault of either party and that it fundamentally undermines the purpose.

Alternatively, there's the doctrine of substantial impairment, where the contract is so affected by an event that it's no longer worth performing. But I think that's more about mutual rescission, which isn't directly applicable here.

Now, looking at the options:

A: It would not be excused because no health emergency clause. That's about express terms in the contract. The contract didn't have a health clause, so she can't use that. But is that the only reason? Maybe, but other doctrines might apply.

B: Not excused because she knew it was non-refundable. That's about her voluntariness, but non-refundable doesn't necessarily mean she has to continue paying if she can't attend. It just means she can't get her money back if she stops.

C: Excused because essential purpose was frustrated. So, if the main reason she entered the contract was for the exercise classes, and the accident made that impossible, maybe. But does the gym's ability to provide the classes matter? Or is it her inability to receive the benefit?

D: Not excused because inability doesn't affect the gym's ability. That seems to suggest that the gym can still offer the classes, so she must pay. But that might be more about the gym's position, not necessarily her obligation.

E: Excused because accident was unforeseen and made it impossible to continue. That sounds like impossibility, but is attending class impossible, or is she just unable to attend? Impossibility is more about the service itself being unavailable.

F: Excused because her health changed without fault. That's more about her personal circumstances. But does that alone discharge her obligation? Maybe, but it depends on whether her inability to attend affects the contract's purpose.

G: Not excused because fees are non-refundable. Again, that's about refunds, not future payments. She might still owe the money even if she can't attend.

H: Not excused because the installment payment is a condition precedent. A condition precedent is something that must happen before the other party's obligation arises. But in this case, the payment is part of the contract terms, not a condition. So maybe not relevant here.

I: Excused because of impossibility of performance. If attending the classes is impossible due to her condition, then maybe. But is her not attending because of health the same as impossibility?

J: Not excused because she can't use the services due to personal reasons. That seems like a possible argument, but personal reasons might not be enough unless they rise to the level of impossibility or frustration.

So, the key here is whether the woman can claim frustration of purpose or impossibility. The accident was unforeseen, and her doctor told her to stop attending. But she's not claiming that the gym can't provide the service, just that she can't receive it.

Frustration of purpose would require that the primary purpose of the contract was for her to attend the classes, and that attending is now impossible. Since she can't attend, the purpose is frustrated. But some jurisdictions might not apply frustration of purpose if the event affects only one party's ability to perform, especially if it's a health issue.

Alternatively, if the contract is for services, and she can't use them, maybe she's still liable because she's not excused from paying unless there's a specific clause or a legal doctrine that applies.

Looking at the options, C says it's excused because the essential purpose was frustrated. I: Excused because of impossibility of performance. E: Excused because it's an unforeseen event making it impossible to continue.

But wait, the accident is an unforeseen event, but does that make it impossible to perform? Or does it just make her unable to attend? Impossibility is about the performance itself being impossible, not just her personal inability.

So perhaps the better argument is frustration of purpose. The main reason she entered the contract was to attend the classes, which is now impossible because of her health. So, option C could be the right choice.

But another angle: the contract is for the gym to provide classes, and she's supposed to pay. Her inability to attend doesn't affect the gym's ability to perform, so the gym can still offer the classes. Therefore, she's still obligated to pay because her personal circumstances don't discharge her payment obligation, only her attendance.

If that's the case, then options like D or J might be correct. D says her inability doesn't affect the gym's ability, so she still has to pay.

Wait, but D says it's not excused because her inability doesn't affect the gym. So the gym can still provide the service, so she must pay regardless.

But under contract law, the duty to pay is separate from the duty to perform. She's paying for the right to attend, but if she can't attend due to health, does that relieve her of the payment obligation? Or is payment a separate condition?

In some cases, payment is considered a separate obligation. So even if she can't attend, she might still have to pay because the contract doesn't tie payment to attendance beyond the initial terms.

So, looking at the contract, it's a one-year program with non-refundable fees. She has a duty to pay each installment regardless of whether she attends. Therefore, her inability to attend doesn't relieve her of the payment obligation.

So, in that case, the correct answer would be that she's still obligated to pay. Looking at the options, G says it's not excused because fees are non-refundable. That might be a reason, but non-refundable refers to getting her money back, not about future payments.

Option D: Not excused because her inability doesn't affect the gym's ability. That seems to align with the idea that the gym can still offer the classes, so she must pay.

Alternatively, option J says it's not excused because she can't use the services due to personal reasons. That's another way of putting it; her personal circumstances don't discharge her payment obligations unless there's a specific clause or doctrine.

So, putting it all together, the woman's duty to pay isn't excused because her inability to attend doesn't affect the gym's ability to provide the service. Therefore, she still has to pay. So the correct answer would be D or J.

Wait, looking back at the options:

D: It would not be excused, because the woman's inability to attend the classes does not affect the gymnasium's ability to provide them.

J: It would not be excused, as the gymnasium offered services that the woman could no longer use due to personal reasons.

So, D is more about the gym's ability, while J is about her personal reasons. Which is more accurate?

In contract law, her personal inability to use the service is generally not a defense unless there's a specific clause or a doctrine like frustration applies. Since the contract is structured such that she pays regardless of attendance, unless a doctrine applies, she's still liable.

So, if the doctrines don't apply (like impossibility or frustration), then her personal reasons don't relieve her of the payment. Therefore, J might be the better answer, as it's about her personal reasons making the services unusable.

Alternatively, G says it's not excused because fees are non-refundable, but that's about refunds, not future payments.

So, considering that, I think the best answer is D or J. But since D states that her inability doesn't affect the gym's ability, which is a correct statement, but the real reason she's not excused is that her personal circumstances don't discharge her payment obligations unless a contract clause or doctrine excuses it.

Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is J: Not excused because she can't use the services due to personal reasons.

Wait, but J says it's not excused as she can't use the services, implying that her personal reasons don't excuse her. But is that the correct legal reasoning? Or is it more about the gym's ability?

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Another way to look at it is that the contract is for the service, and she's paying for access, not for the actual attendance. So even if she can't attend, she's still bound to pay because she's already committed to the contract.

In that case, the answer would be that she's not excused because her inability doesn't affect the gym's ability to provide the service, which is option D.

Alternatively, the answer could be E, if the accident is considered an unforeseen event, but that would be more about impossibility.

Wait, the accident made it impossible for her to continue, so E says it's an unforeseen event making it impossible. But is attending class impossible, or is she just choosing not to attend? Impossibility is a higher threshold.

I think the correct answer is that she's not excused because her inability doesn't affect the gym's ability, so D is correct.

But I'm a bit torn between D and J. D focuses on the gym's ability, while J focuses on her personal reasons. Since the contract doesn't tie payment to attendance, and she's already paid the first installment, the gym can still provide the service, so she must pay. Therefore, D seems more accurate.
</think>

The woman's duty to pay the second installment fee of $500 is not excused because her inability to attend the classes does not affect the gymnasium's ability to provide the services. The contract specifies non-refundable fees, and her personal circumstances, such as health issues, do not discharge her payment obligations unless a specific clause or doctrine applies. Since the gym can still offer the classes, she remains obligated to pay. 

Answer: D
