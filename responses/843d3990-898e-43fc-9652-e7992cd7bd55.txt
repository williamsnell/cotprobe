Question:

Consider the following instance variable and methods in the same class.
 private int[][] matrix;
 /** Precondition: array.length > 0.
 * @return the largest integer in array
 */
 private int max(int[] array)
 { /* implementation not shown */ }
 /** @return num1 if num1 >= num2; otherwise return num2
 */
 public int max(int num1, int num2)
 { /* implementation not shown */ }
 Suppose matrix has a current value of
 2 1 4 8
 6 0 3 9
 5 7 7 6
 1 2 3 4
 What will be returned by the following method call in the same class?
 max(max(matrix[2]), max(matrix[3]))

Options:

A: 8
B: 0
C: 1
D: 2
E: 9
F: 4
G: 5
H: 7
I: 10
J: 6

Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the question is about figuring out what the method max(max(matrix[2]), max(matrix[3])) will return. Hmm, I need to break this down step by step.

First, I see that there's a class with an instance variable matrix, which is a 2D array of integers. The matrix's current value is given as four rows. Let me visualize it:

Row 0: 2 1 4 8
Row 1: 6 0 3 9
Row 2: 5 7 7 6
Row 3: 1 2 3 4

Wait, wait. Actually, matrix indices start at 0, right? So matrix[0] is the first row, matrix[1] the second, and so on. So when the method is called as max(max(matrix[2]), max(matrix[3])), I'm looking at rows 2 and 3.

Let me list out matrix[2] and matrix[3]. Matrix[2] is [5,7,7,6], and matrix[3] is [1,2,3,4].

Now, the method max(int[] array) is supposed to return the largest integer in that array. So first, I'll find the max of matrix[2]. Looking at [5,7,7,6], the largest is 7. So the first max() call returns 7.

Next, the second max() call is on matrix[3], which is [1,2,3,4]. The largest here is 4. So now, the second max() returns 4.

Now, the outer max() method is called with these two values: max(7,4). The max(int num1, int num2) method returns the larger of the two. So comparing 7 and 4, 7 is larger. So the result should be 7.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the indices. Oh right, matrix[2] is the third row, and matrix[3] is the fourth. So yes, their maxes are 7 and 4, respectively. Then comparing 7 and 4 gives 7.

Looking at the options, option H is 7. So the answer should be H.

The method first computes the maximum of matrix[2] (which is 7) and matrix[3] (which is 4). Then it compares these two maxima, resulting in 7.

Answer: H
