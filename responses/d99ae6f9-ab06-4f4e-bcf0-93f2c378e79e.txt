Question:

The dorsal root of a nerve leading to the leg of a rat is severed. How will this affect the rat? How would the effect vary if the ventral root were severed instead?

Options:

A: Severing the ventral root results in loss of motor function, but sensation remains intact.
B: Severing the dorsal root causes hyperactivity in movement, while severing the ventral root leads to increased sensation.
C: Severing the dorsal root will lead to loss of sensation and reflex action, but if the ventral root is severed, the rat would sense the stimulation but would not be able to react.
D: Severing the dorsal root has no impact on sensation or motor function, while severing the ventral root causes tremors.
E: Severing the dorsal root won't have an effect
F: Severing the dorsal root causes a loss of motor function, whereas severing the ventral root has no effect on the rat.
G: Both the dorsal and ventral root severing lead to enhanced reflex actions.
H: Severing either root causes paralysis
I: Severing the dorsal root results in enhanced sensation, but severing the ventral root causes complete paralysis.
J: Severing the ventral root causes loss of sensation

Okay, so I have this question about the effects of severing the dorsal or ventral roots of a nerve leading to the leg of a rat. Hmm, I remember from my biology classes that nerves have these two roots, dorsal and ventral, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think.

Wait, I think the dorsal root is related to sensory functions, and the ventral root is for motor functions. So if the dorsal root is severed, the sensory part would be affected. That means the rat wouldn't be able to feel anything in that leg, right? Because the sensory neurons are in the dorsal root.

And what about the motor function? Motor control comes from the ventral root. So if the ventral root is severed, the rat wouldn't be able to move that leg because the motor signals can't get through. So the ventral root affects movement, and the dorsal affects sensation.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. Option A says severing the ventral root causes loss of motor function but sensation remains. That makes sense because the ventral is motor. So if it's severed, no motor function, but since the dorsal is intact, sensation is fine. So A is correct for the ventral part.

Option C says severing the dorsal leads to loss of sensation and reflex. Wait, reflexes are usually part of the sensory pathway. If the sensory part is gone, reflexes can't happen because reflexes involve detecting a stimulus (sensory) and responding (motor). So without the dorsal, no reflexes either. And if the ventral is severed, the rat can sense but can't react because motor is gone. So C seems correct for the first part and the second part too.

Wait, but the question is asking how each severing affects the rat. So if the dorsal is cut, no sensation and no reflexes. If the ventral is cut, sensation is fine but no motor function, so can't react. So which option matches this?

Option C says: Severing the dorsal leads to loss of sensation and reflex, and if ventral is cut, sense but can't react. That matches what I was thinking.

Looking at other options: Option F says severing dorsal causes loss of motor, which is wrong because motor is ventral. So F is incorrect. Option A is correct for the ventral part but doesn't address the dorsal's effect on reflexes.

So the correct answer should be option C. Let me check again. Dorsal root severed: no sensation (because sensory is gone) and no reflexes (since reflexes rely on the sensory input). Ventral root severed: sensation is there (dorsal intact) but can't move (ventral gone, no motor). So yes, option C is right.

The dorsal root of a nerve is primarily responsible for sensory functions, while the ventral root is responsible for motor functions. Severing the dorsal root would result in the loss of sensation and reflex actions, as reflexes depend on sensory input. Severing the ventral root would leave sensation intact but would impair motor function, preventing the rat from reacting to stimuli.

Answer: C
