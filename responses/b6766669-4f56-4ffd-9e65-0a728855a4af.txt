Question:

A chemist dropped a 200 g object into a tank of water. It displaced 60 ml. of the water when it sunk to the bottom of the tank. In a similar experiment, it displaced only 50 g of an oil into which it was dropped. Calculate the density of the object and the oil.

Options:

A: Density of the object is 3.33 g/ml and the oil is 0.83 g/ml
B: Density of the object is 4 g/ml and the oil is 0.9 g/ml
C: Density of the object is 3.33 g/ml and the oil is 1 g/ml
D: Density of the object is 2.5 g/ml and the oil is 0.75 g/ml
E: Density of the object is 2.5 g/ml and the oil is 1 g/ml
F: Density of the object is 4 g/ml and the oil is 0.75 g/ml
G: Density of the object is 2.5 g/ml and the oil is 0.9 g/ml
H: Density of the object is 4 g/ml and the oil is 0.83 g/ml
I: Density of the object is 3.5 g/ml and the oil is 0.9 g/ml
J: Density of the object is 3.5 g/ml and the oil is 1 g/ml

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. 

A chemist dropped a 200 g object into a tank of water. It displaced 60 ml of water when it sunk to the bottom. Then, in another experiment, the same object was dropped into oil and displaced only 50 grams of oil. We need to find the density of the object and the oil, and then choose the correct option from A to J.

Alright, let me break this down. First, I remember that when an object is submerged in a fluid, it displaces a volume equal to its own volume. The mass of the displaced fluid can be found using density times volume, right? So density equals mass over volume, or ρ = m/V.

In the first scenario, the object is in water. The object's mass is 200 grams, and it displaces 60 ml of water. Since water's density is 1 g/ml, the mass of the displaced water is 60 grams. But wait, the object's mass is 200 grams, which is more than the displaced water. That makes sense because if the object's density is higher than water, it will sink. So the object's density must be higher than water's, which is 1 g/ml.

Wait, no. Wait, the displaced water's volume is 60 ml. So the object's volume is 60 ml because it's submerged completely. So the object's volume is 60 ml. Now, the object's mass is 200 grams, so its density is mass divided by volume. So 200 g / 60 ml = approximately 3.333 g/ml. Hmm, so the object's density is about 3.33 g/ml. That's one of the options. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option A says the object is 3.33 g/ml and the oil is 0.83. Option C says oil is 1 g/ml. Option I and J have higher object densities, but from my calculation, it's 3.33.

Now, the second part is about the oil. The same object, which has a mass of 200 grams, was dropped into oil and displaced 50 grams of oil. Wait, but how does that work? Because the oil displaced would have a volume equal to the object's volume. Wait, no: when the object is submerged in oil, it displaces oil equal to its own volume. But the mass of the displaced oil is 50 grams.

Wait, but the volume displaced is the same as the object's volume, which is 60 ml, right? Because the object's volume is 60 ml, regardless of the fluid. So the oil displaced would be 60 ml of oil, but its mass is 50 grams. So the oil's density is mass divided by volume. So 50 grams / 60 ml = 0.833... g/ml, which is approximately 0.83 g/ml.

So putting it together, the object's density is 3.33 g/ml and the oil's density is 0.83 g/ml. Looking at the options, that's option A.

Wait, but I should double-check. Let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. The object's volume is from the water displacement: 60 ml. So object's density is 200g /60ml=3.33 g/ml. In oil, same volume (60ml) displaces oil of mass 50g. So oil density is 50/60=0.833 g/ml. So yes, option A matches.
</think>

The object's volume is 60 ml from the water displacement. Its density is 200 g / 60 ml = 3.33 g/ml. In oil, the same volume displaces 50 g, so oil's density is 50 g / 60 ml ≈ 0.83 g/ml. Option A matches these values.

Answer: A
