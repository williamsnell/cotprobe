Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Clovis points and where they are not found. Let me try to think this through step by step.

First, I remember that Clovis points are a type of stone tool associated with the Clovis culture, which was an ancient Paleoindian group in North America. These points are known for their distinctive shape, which is a long, fluted projectile point. They're usually associated with hunting large game animals, like mammoths.

Now, the question is asking where Clovis points are NOT found. The options are Canada, Mexico, the continental United States, and Alaska. So I need to figure out which of these places doesn't have Clovis points.

I think Clovis culture sites have been found in many parts of North America. I recall that the Clovis people were widespread, so their tools should be present in various regions. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Canada. I believe that Clovis points have been found in Canada. I think the Clovis culture expanded into what is now Canada, so they should be present there. So A is probably not the correct answer.

Option B: Mexico. I'm pretty sure that Clovis points are also found in Mexico. There have been archaeological sites in Mexico that date back to the Clovis period, so they should have these points. So B is likely not the answer either.

Option C: the continental United States. Well, the Clovis culture is actually named after a site in New Mexico, which is part of the continental US. So obviously, Clovis points are found here. So C isn't the correct answer.

Option D: Alaska. Hmm, this is where I'm less certain. I know that Alaska has had some Paleoindian sites, but I'm not sure if Clovis points are found there. Wait, I think the Clovis culture was more concentrated in the lower 48 states and parts of Canada and Mexico. Alaska might have had a different culture, perhaps the Paleo-Eskimo groups, which had different toolkits. So maybe Clovis points aren't found in Alaska.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. I remember that the Clovis people were big game hunters, and they might have migrated from Siberia to Alaska via the Bering Land Bridge, but once they were in Alaska, they might have adapted to the environment differently. So perhaps their tools, including Clovis points, aren't found in Alaska because they either didn't settle there or their tool styles changed. Alternatively, maybe the Clovis points are found in Alaska, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: I think that the Clovis points are primarily found in the lower 48, Canada, and Mexico, but not so much in Alaska. Because Alaska's environment might have been different, requiring different tools. So the answer might be D: Alaska.

Alternatively, I might be confusing it with another culture. I think that in Alaska, the tools are more like the ones from the Dyuktai culture or other Paleo-Eskimo groups, which have different characteristics. So Clovis points would not be found in Alaska, making D the correct answer.

Clovis points are associated with the Clovis culture, a Paleoindian group in North America known for their distinctive fluted projectile points used for hunting large game. These points have been found in various regions, including Canada and Mexico, as well as the continental United States. However, they are not typically found in Alaska, where different toolkits, such as those from Paleo-Eskimo cultures, are more commonly associated with the archaeological record.

Answer: D
