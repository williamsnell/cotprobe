Okay, so I have this physics problem about simple harmonic motion. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll do my best.

The equation given is y = 4 sin{(2πt/6) + α}. So, that's the displacement y as a function of time t, right? The amplitude is 4 units because it's the coefficient in front of the sine function. 

Part (a) asks for the phase angle when t=0. Oh, right, phase angle is the constant term inside the sine function when t is zero. So, when t=0, the equation becomes y = 4 sin(α). But we're told that at t=0, the displacement y is +1 unit. So, I can set up the equation 1 = 4 sin(α). 

Wait, sin(α) = 1/4. To find α, I need to take the inverse sine of 1/4. Let me calculate that. The arcsin of 0.25 is approximately 0.2527 radians, which is about 14.47 degrees. Hmm, but I don't see that exact value in the options. Wait, let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option A says phase angle π/6, which is about 0.5236 radians or 30 degrees. Option B is π/2, which is 90 degrees, way too big. Option D says π/6 as well. Option E has π/12.4, which is approximately 0.2526 radians, very close to what I calculated. So E's phase angle is π/12.4, which is about 14.47 degrees, matching my calculation. So for part (a), E or another option with that value?

Wait, let's check all options. Looking through, E says phase angle π/12.4, which matches. H also says π/12.4. Let me note that and move on to part (b) to see if it fits.

Part (b) is the phase difference between two positions 2 seconds apart. The formula for phase in SHM is usually ωt + α. So, the phase at time t is (2πt/T) + α, where T is the period. The given equation has (2πt/6), so T must be 6 seconds because 2πt / T = 2πt/6, so T=6. 

The phase at t=0 is α, and at t=2, phase is (2π*2)/6 + α = (4π/6) + α = (2π/3) + α. The phase difference between t=2 and t=0 is (2π/3) + α - α = 2π/3 radians. Converting that to degrees, since π radians is 180 degrees, 2π/3 is 120 degrees. So the phase difference should be 120 degrees.

Looking at the options, which ones have phase difference 120 degrees? Let's see:

Option E says phase difference 60 degrees. No. Option H says phase difference 120 degrees. So H has phase difference 120, which matches. Option I says 240, which is double, so no. Option A: 240, no. So H and E are possible so far, but E's phase difference is 60, which doesn't match. So E is out.

Wait, earlier I thought E's phase angle was correct, but the phase difference in E is 60 degrees, which doesn't match the 120 we calculated. So H has phase angle π/12.4, which is correct, and phase difference 120 degrees, which is correct. So H might be a candidate.

Moving on to part (c): phase angle corresponding to displacement +2. The equation is y=4 sin(θ), where θ is the phase. So when y=2, 2=4 sinθ → sinθ=0.5. So θ = π/6 (30 degrees) or 5π/6 (150 degrees). But since the displacement is positive, it could be either, but in the context, the phase angle would be the smallest positive angle, so π/6, which is 30 degrees.

Looking at the options, H says phase angle 30 degrees. So that's correct. So part (c) is 30 degrees.

Now part (d): time to reach a displacement of +3. Displacement y=3. So 3=4 sinθ → sinθ=3/4=0.75. So θ = arcsin(0.75) ≈ 0.84806 radians or about 48.59 degrees. Wait, but that's the phase angle. How does that relate to time?

The phase θ at time t is (2πt/6) + α. But α is π/12.4, as per H. So θ = (π t/3) + (π/12.4). We set this equal to 0.84806 radians.

So: (π t/3) + (π/12.4) = 0.84806

Let me solve for t. Subtract π/12.4 from both sides:

(π t)/3 = 0.84806 - (π/12.4)

Calculate π/12.4 first. π ≈3.1416, so 3.1416 /12.4 ≈0.2527 radians.

So 0.84806 - 0.2527 ≈0.59536 radians.

So (π t)/3 = 0.59536 → t = (0.59536 *3)/π ≈ (1.78608)/3.1416 ≈0.569 seconds.

Wait, but wait. The sine function is positive in the first and second quadrants, but since the particle is moving, I might need to consider the time when it first reaches +3. So the first time would be when θ is in the first quadrant, so θ ≈0.84806 radians. But wait, maybe I should also consider the time when the sine reaches 3/4, which occurs at t such that (2πt/6) + α = arcsin(3/4). Alternatively, perhaps it's better to approach this differently.

Wait, maybe I should consider the initial phase. Let me compute the time when the displacement is +3. 

The equation is y =4 sin( (2πt/6) + α ). So 3=4 sin( (π t/3) + α )

We have α = π/12.4 ≈0.2527 radians.

So, sin(θ) = 3/4 → θ = π - arcsin(3/4) ≈ π - 0.84806 ≈2.2935 radians (since the sine is positive in first and second quadrants). Wait, no, wait: when the displacement is +3, the angle could be in the first or second quadrant. But since the particle is executing SHM, it starts at y=1, which is positive, so the initial phase is positive. The first time it reaches +3 would be when the sine is at 3/4, which is in the first quadrant, so θ=arcsin(3/4)≈0.84806 radians.

So, (π t/3) + α = 0.84806

We can rearrange to solve for t:

t = [0.84806 - α] * (3/π)

We have α = π/12.4 ≈0.2527.

So 0.84806 - 0.2527 ≈0.59536.

t ≈ (0.59536 *3)/3.1416 ≈ (1.78608)/3.1416 ≈0.569 seconds.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H says time is 0.57 seconds, which matches. So part (d) is 0.57 seconds.

So putting it all together: 

(a) Phase angle at t=0 is π/12.4 radians (≈14.47 degrees) → matches H.

(b) Phase difference after 2 seconds is 120 degrees → matches H.

(c) Phase angle for y=+2 is 30 degrees → matches H.

(d) Time to reach y=+3 is ~0.57 seconds → matches H.

So the correct option is H.
