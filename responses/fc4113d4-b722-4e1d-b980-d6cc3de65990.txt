Okay, so I've got this question about which organ has the lowest energy expenditure per kilogram of body mass. The options are Brain, Kidney, Liver, and Skeletal Muscle. Hmm, I need to figure this out.

First, I remember that different organs have different metabolic rates. The brain is known to be very energy-hungry. I think the brain uses a lot of glucose, like around 20-25% of the body's total energy. So, the brain probably isn't the one with the lowest expenditure.

Skeletal muscle, on the other hand, is a big part of the body, but I'm not sure about its energy use. I know that muscles can be either active or resting, but at rest, maybe their energy use isn't as high as the brain. But wait, muscles have a lot of mitochondria, so maybe they use more energy when active. But the question is about per unit mass, so even if they're big, maybe their rate per kg isn't the highest.

The liver is another organ I'm considering. I remember that the liver is a busy organ, doing lots of metabolic processes. It probably has a high energy demand. So maybe the liver is higher than some others.

Then there's the kidney. I'm a bit fuzzy on the kidney's energy use. I think kidneys work continuously, filtering blood, but I'm not sure how that compares to the brain or liver in terms of energy per kg.

Wait, I think the brain uses about 20-25% of the body's energy, which is a lot for its size. The liver is also quite active, but maybe not as high as the brain. Skeletal muscle at rest might have a lower metabolic rate than the liver. So if the question is about per kg, the brain might have a higher rate, so the organ with the lowest would be the skeletal muscle.

Alternatively, maybe the kidney has a lower rate. I'm a bit confused here. I think the liver and brain are the highest, so between the kidney and muscle. I think muscle has a lower metabolic rate than the liver but higher than, say, skin or other organs. Wait, but per kg, muscle might be lower than the other options. So the answer might be skeletal muscle, option D.

Wait, another angle: heart has a high rate, but it's not an option here. So, among the options, I think the brain is the highest, liver next, then kidney, and skeletal muscle the lowest. So the answer is D, skeletal muscle.

The organ with the lowest energy expenditure per unit of body mass (kg) is skeletal muscle. 

Answer: D
