Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Statement 1 | For finite groups G and H, |G + H| = |G||H|. (G + H is the internal direct product.) Statement 2 | If r divides m and s divides n then Z_m + Z_n has a subgroup isomorphic to Z_r + Z_s.

Options:

A: False for all groups, True for all groups
B: False, False
C: False, True if G and H are not finite
D: False, True for finite groups only
E: True, False
F: True for all groups, False for all groups
G: True, False if r does not divide m and s does not divide n
H: True, True only if r divides m and s divides n
I: False, True
J: True, True

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about group theory, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me take it step by step.

The question presents two statements and asks whether each is true or false, then selects the correct option based on that.

Statement 1: For finite groups G and H, |G + H| = |G||H|. Here, G + H is the internal direct product.

Hmm, I remember that the internal direct product of two groups G and H, denoted G + H, is when you have a group that is the direct product of G and H, and both G and H are normal subgroups with trivial intersection. Now, the order of the direct product group should be the product of their orders. So |G × H| = |G| × |H|. Since the internal direct product is essentially the same as the direct product in terms of structure, the order should also be |G| × |H|. So Statement 1 seems true.

Wait, but wait a second. The internal direct product is a way to construct a group from two normal subgroups. So if G and H are finite, their internal direct product should have order equal to the product of their orders because the intersection is trivial. So yes, Statement 1 is true.

Now, Statement 2: If r divides m and s divides n, then Z_m + Z_n has a subgroup isomorphic to Z_r + Z_s.

Z_m denotes the cyclic group of order m, and similarly for Z_n. So Z_m + Z_n is the direct product of two cyclic groups. Now, when you take the direct product of two cyclic groups, the structure is such that any subgroups would also be direct products of subgroups of each component. 

If r divides m, then Z_m has a subgroup isomorphic to Z_r. Similarly, Z_n has a subgroup isomorphic to Z_s if s divides n. Therefore, the direct product of these subgroups would be Z_r × Z_s, which is isomorphic to Z_r + Z_s since they're both abelian. So Statement 2 is also true under the conditions given.

Wait, but I should double-check. Let me think: if r divides m, then in Z_m, the subgroup generated by an element of order r exists. Similarly for s dividing n. So their product as subgroups would be isomorphic to Z_r × Z_s, which is indeed the same as their direct sum since they're abelian. So yes, Statement 2 is true.

Wait, but what if the original groups are not cyclic? Oh, but in the question, the groups are Z_m and Z_n, which are cyclic. So that part's okay.

Wait, but let me think again. If r divides m and s divides n, then Z_m has a subgroup of order r, and Z_n has a subgroup of order s. Then the direct product of these two subgroups would have order r*s, and since they're both cyclic, their product is isomorphic to Z_r + Z_s. So yes, Statement 2 is true.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you take subgroups, the structure can be more complicated, but in the case of cyclic groups, it's straightforward. So I think I'm correct.

So, Statement 1 is True, and Statement 2 is True. Therefore, the correct option would be J: True, True.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option J is "True, True", which matches my conclusion. So the answer should be J.
</think>

The first statement is true because the order of the internal direct product of two finite groups is the product of their orders. The second statement is true because if r divides m and s divides n, then Z_m and Z_n have subgroups of orders r and s, respectively, whose direct product is isomorphic to Z_r + Z_s.

Answer: J
