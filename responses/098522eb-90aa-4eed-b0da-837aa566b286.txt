Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: An oscillator of frequency 2.3 × 10^8 Hz is set up near a plane metal reflector, and the distance between adjacent nodes in the standing waves produced is found to be 65 cm. From this data, compute the velocity of light.

Hmm, right, I remember that when you have an oscillator and a reflector, it creates standing waves. The nodes in a standing wave are points where the displacement is always zero. The distance between adjacent nodes must be related to the wavelength somehow.

Wait, in standing waves, the nodes are points of no displacement. So the distance between two nodes would be half a wavelength, right? Because between two nodes, you go from zero displacement to maximum, then back to zero. That's a half wavelength, I think. Or wait, maybe full wavelength? No, wait, no, in a standing wave setup between a fixed end and a free end (like a reflector), the nodes are spaced by half a wavelength. Because each node is a point where the wave reflects and cancels out, so the distance between them is λ/2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. When you have a standing wave between two points, like in a string fixed at both ends, the nodes are spaced by λ/2. Because each node is a point where the two waves interfere destructively. So the distance between two adjacent nodes is λ/2. So if the distance between nodes is 65 cm, that's λ/2. So λ = 2 * 65 cm.

Wait, 65 cm is 0.65 meters, but in the options, the speeds are given in cm/sec. So maybe I should work in centimeters to avoid unit confusion.

So 65 cm is the distance between nodes, so λ = 2 * 65 cm = 130 cm.

Wait, no, no, wait. Wait, in a standing wave setup like this, between a source and a reflector, the standing wave forms with nodes spaced by half wavelengths. Because the first node is at the reflector (fixed end), and the next node is at a distance of λ/2 from it, then another at λ, etc.

So the distance between two adjacent nodes is λ/2. So if that's 65 cm, then λ = 65 cm * 2 = 130 cm.

But wait, let me double-check. Another way: the distance between two adjacent nodes in a standing wave is one full wavelength? No, no, I think it's λ/2. Because each node is a point of destructive interference, so the separation between them is half a wavelength. So yeah, λ = 2 * 65 cm = 130 cm = 1.3 meters.

Wait, but in some cases, like a string fixed at both ends, the nodes are spaced by λ/2. So for this problem, the setup is an oscillator near a reflector, which is like one end fixed. So the standing wave forms with nodes at intervals of λ/2.

So, the wavelength λ is 130 cm.

Now, the velocity of light, which is the same as the velocity of the wave in this case, because the problem is about light (I think, since it's talking about an oscillator near a reflector and standing waves, so probably electromagnetic waves, like light or radio waves).

The formula that relates frequency (f), wavelength (λ), and velocity (v) is v = f * λ.

So, we know f is given as 2.3 × 10^8 Hz. And λ is 130 cm, which is 1.3 meters, but better to keep in cm for the answer's units.

Wait, λ is 130 cm, which is 1.3 meters, but the options are in cm/sec, so maybe it's better to express λ in cm.

Wait, 130 cm is already in cm, so λ = 130 cm.

So, velocity v = f * λ = (2.3 × 10^8 Hz) * (130 cm).

Let me calculate that.

First, 2.3 × 10^8 Hz is 2.3e8 Hz.

Multiply by 130 cm: 2.3e8 * 130 = ?

Let me compute that. 2.3 * 130 is 299, so 299e8 cm/s.

But wait, 2.3 * 130 is: 2.3 * 100 = 230, 2.3 * 30 = 69, total 299. So yes, 299e8 cm/s.

Wait, 2.3e8 * 130 = 2.3e8 * 1.3e2 = 2.3 * 1.3 * 1e10 = (2.99) * 1e10 cm/s.

So v = 2.99 × 10^10 cm/s.

Looking at the options:

A:2.99 ×10^10 cm/sec

B:2.50 ×10^10

C:2.99 ×10^9

D:2.99 ×10^11

E:3.99 ×10^10

F:1.50 ×10^10

G:1.99 ×10^10

H:3.00 ×10^9

I:4.50 ×10^10

J:1.99 ×10^9

So the correct answer would be option A.

The problem involves calculating the velocity of light using the given frequency and the distance between adjacent nodes in a standing wave. The distance between nodes is half the wavelength, so the wavelength is 130 cm. Using the formula \( v = f \lambda \), where \( f = 2.3 \times 10^8 \, \text{Hz} \) and \( \lambda = 130 \, \text{cm} \), the velocity is \( 2.99 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cm/s} \), which corresponds to option A.
