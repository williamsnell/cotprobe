Okay, so I have this physics question here about Coulomb's Law. Hmm, let me think. The question is asking what happens to the force between two charged particles when they're placed twice as close. I remember Coulomb's Law from my studies, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details, so I need to recall it properly.

Coulomb's Law states that the force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The formula is F = k*(q1*q2)/(r^2), where k is Coulomb's constant, q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.

So the question is, if the distance is doubled, what happens to the force? Let's say the initial distance is r, so the initial force is F = k*q1*q2/r². If the distance becomes twice as close, the new distance is r/2 because they were moved closer. Wait, no—wait, wait! If they are placed twice as close, does that mean the new distance is half the original? Let me clarify: Suppose the original distance was r. If they are placed twice as close, that would mean the new distance is r divided by 2, so r/2.

Plugging that into the formula, the new force F' would be F' = k*q1*q2/( (r/2)² ). Let me compute that denominator: (r/2) squared is r²/4. So F' becomes k*q1*q2/(r²/4) which is the same as 4*(k*q1*q2/r²). But wait, the original force F was k*q1*q2/r², so F' = 4F. So the force becomes four times stronger.

Wait, no, wait again. Wait, the question says "twice as close to each other." So if they were initially at distance d, moving them twice as close would make the new distance d multiplied by 1/2, because "twice as close" as before. So the new distance is d/2. So the force is inversely proportional to (d/2)^2, which is d²/4. So the denominator is smaller, making the force larger by a factor of 4.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. If the original distance is r, then moving them closer by half the distance would mean the new distance is r/2, so the denominator becomes (r/2)^2 = r²/4. Therefore, the force increases by a factor of 4, because F' = F * (r²) / ( (r/2)^2 ) = F * 4. So the force is four times as strong.

Looking back at the options, option A is "four times as strong." So the answer should be A.

Wait, but wait another thing. Sometimes people get confused between moving twice as close and doubling the distance. If the distance were doubled, then F would be F/4. But in this case, it's the opposite—they are moved closer, so the force increases.

Another way to think about it: If the distance is halved, the force becomes four times stronger because it's inverse square. So yes, four times as strong.

The force between two charged particles is given by Coulomb's Law: \( F = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \), where \( r \) is the distance between the charges. If the distance is halved (twice as close), the new force is \( F' = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{(r/2)^2} = 4F \). Thus, the force becomes four times as strong.

Answer: A
