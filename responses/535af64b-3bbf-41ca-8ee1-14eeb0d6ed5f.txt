Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Swiss starlings and their egg production. Let me think through this step by step. 

The question says that most Swiss starlings produce four to five eggs in each clutch. Those that produce fewer or more than this have reduced fitness. I need to figure out which term best describes this scenario.

First, I remember that selection terms relate to how traits affect an organism's survival and reproduction. The main types of selection include natural selection, sexual selection, directional, stabilizing, and disruptive selection, among others. 

In this case, the starlings that deviate from the average number of eggs (either fewer or more) have lower fitness. So, the optimal number of eggs is four to five, and any variation from that—either higher or lower—leads to reduced fitness. 

I think about the different types of selection. Natural selection is the general term for traits being selected based on their fitness. But there are more specific types. Stabilizing selection favors the average or intermediate traits and reduces variation. That seems to fit because the starlings are better off with the average number of eggs. 

On the other hand, disruptive selection favors extreme traits, which isn't the case here. Directional selection favors one extreme over another, so if producing more eggs was better, that would be directional. But here, both extremes (fewer and more) are worse, so it's not directional.

I also consider other options. Sexual selection is about traits that help an organism attract a mate, which doesn't seem relevant here. Artificial selection is when humans choose traits, which isn't the case either. Negative selection refers to removing harmful traits, but here it's about the number of eggs, which is a neutral trait unless it's at the extremes. 

Balancing selection maintains multiple traits in the population, like in heterozygote advantage, which doesn't apply here. Kin selection is about aiding relatives, which isn't relevant to egg production. So, the best fit seems to be stabilizing selection because it's about maintaining the average and reducing variation in traits.

The scenario describes stabilizing selection, where the average number of eggs (four to five) is optimal, and deviations (fewer or more) reduce fitness. This reduces variation in the trait.

Answer: B
