Okay, so I need to figure out Mr. Darnell's loss per share and his total loss when he sold the stock. Let me break it down step by step.

First, he bought 20 shares of American Telephone and Telegraph common stock at $182.50 per share. So, the total amount he spent initially would be the number of shares multiplied by the price per share. That would be 20 * $182.50. Let me calculate that. 20 times 180 is 3600, and 20 times 2.50 is 50, so adding those together gives me 3650. So he spent $3,650 in total.

Then, two months later, he sold each share for $168.75. To find out how much he sold all the shares for, I need to multiply the selling price per share by the number of shares he sold. That's 20 * $168.75. Let me compute that. 20 times 160 is 3200, and 20 times 8.75 is 175. Adding those together gives me 3375. So he received $3,375 from selling the shares.

Now, to find the total loss, I subtract the selling price total from the purchase price total. That's $3,650 (what he paid) minus $3,375 (what he got). Let's do that math: 3650 - 3375 equals 275. So his total loss is $275.

But the question also asks for the loss per share. Since he sold all 20 shares, the loss per share would be the total loss divided by the number of shares. So that's $275 divided by 20. Let me calculate that: 275 divided by 20 is 13.75. So the loss per share is $13.75.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one has $13.75 per share and a total loss of $275. Let's check the options:

Option J says $13.75 per share and total loss $275. That matches exactly. So the correct answer should be J.

The loss per share is calculated by subtracting the selling price from the purchase price, which is $182.50 - $168.75 = $13.75. The total loss is then $13.75 multiplied by 20 shares, resulting in $275. 

Answer: J
