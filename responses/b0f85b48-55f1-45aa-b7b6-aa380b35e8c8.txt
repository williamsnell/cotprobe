Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how much AlforsMotors will pay for each car after applying the chain discounts. The list price is $6,238.42, and the discounts are 11%, 4%, and 21%. Hmm, I remember that when you have multiple discounts in a chain, you apply each discount one after the other, each time reducing the price based on the previous discount.

Let me break it down step by step. First, I'll apply the 11% discount. So, 11% of $6,238.42 is calculated as 0.11 * 6,238.42. Let me do that: 0.11 times 6,238.42 equals... well, 6,000 * 0.11 is 660, and 238.42 * 0.11 is approximately 26.2262. Adding those together gives 660 + 26.2262 = 686.2262. So the discount is about $686.23. Subtracting that from the original price: 6,238.42 - 686.23 equals 5,552.19. So after the first discount, the price is $5,552.19.

Next, I need to apply the 4% discount to this new price. 4% of 5,552.19 is 0.04 * 5,552.19. Calculating that: 5,552.19 * 0.04 is 222.0876. So the discount is approximately $222.09. Subtracting that from 5,552.19 gives 5,552.19 - 222.09 = 5,330.10. Now the price is $5,330.10 after the second discount.

Now, the third discount is 21%. I apply this to the current price of $5,330.10. So, 21% of 5,330.10 is 0.21 * 5,330.10. Let me compute that: 5,330.10 * 0.21. Well, 5,000 * 0.21 is 1,050, and 330.10 * 0.21 is about 69.321. Adding those gives 1,050 + 69.321 = 1,119.321. So the discount is $1,119.32. Subtracting that from $5,330.10 gives 5,330.10 - 1,119.32 = $4,210.78.

Wait, let me double-check these calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with the first discount: 11% of 6,238.42. 0.11 * 6,238.42 is indeed approximately 686.2262, so subtracting gives 5,552.19. Then 4% of that is 222.0876, so 5,552.19 - 222.09 is 5,330.10. Then 21% of 5,330.10 is 1,119.32, so subtracting that gives 4,210.78. That seems right.

Looking at the options, option D is $4,210.78. So that must be the correct answer.

After applying the chain discounts of 11%, 4%, and 21% sequentially, the final price per car is calculated to be $4,210.78.
