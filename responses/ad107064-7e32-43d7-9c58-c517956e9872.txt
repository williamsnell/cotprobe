Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this contract law question. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand the situation.

Berg offered to sell a parcel of land to Jones for $75,000 cash on March 1. The offer was made in writing via an email sent to Jones' website. Then, Jones responded by mailing a letter on March 10. In this letter, Jones says, "I accept but would like to request that I can pay $25,000 in three equal installments over the next three years." Berg received this letter on March 15. The question is whether a contract was formed, and if so, when.

The options are A through J, each giving a different reason why or why not a contract was formed, and if formed, when.

Alright, so let's break this down. First, I need to recall the basic elements of contract formation. A contract typically requires an offer, acceptance, consideration, and sometimes writing if it's under the Statute of Frauds, but I don't think that's an issue here.

The key point here is the nature of Jones' response. When Jones says, "I accept but would like to request..." is that an acceptance or a counter-offer? Because if it's an acceptance, then the contract is formed when the acceptance is communicated. If it's a counter-offer, then it's a rejection of the original offer and a new offer in its place, meaning there's no acceptance yet.

In contract law, a conditional acceptance is treated as a rejection. So, if someone says, "I accept but only if..." that's not an acceptance; it's a counter-offer. Because they're adding conditions or terms that weren't in the original offer. So in this case, Jones is saying they accept but want to change the payment terms. That sounds like a counter-offer, not an acceptance.

So, if that's the case, then the original offer from Berg is still open. But wait, does the offer allow for modifications? If the offer was firm and didn't indicate that it's open to negotiation, then any modification would be a counter-offer. Here, Berg's offer was for $75,000 cash. Jones is trying to change the payment terms, which is a significant change. So it's definitely a counter-offer.

Therefore, since Jones didn't accept the original offer, there's no contract formed in response to Berg's offer. Instead, Jones made a new offer, which Berg might or might not accept. But as far as this question is concerned, the contract hasn't been formed yet because acceptance hasn't occurred.

Looking at the options:

A: Not formed because the addition was a rejection. That makes sense because Jones didn't accept the terms as offered; they modified them, which is a rejection.

B: Formed on March 10. No, because acceptance didn't happen then; it was a counter-offer.

C: Formed on March 1. No, because acceptance hasn't occurred yet.

D: Not formed because response was a counter-offer. Yes, that's another way to say it. So D is also a possibility.

E: Not formed because installment request is a new offer. That's similar to D. So E is considering the response as a new offer, which is correct.

Wait, so which is correct between D and E?

The question is about whether the contract was formed. If Jones' response is a counter-offer, then the original offer is rejected, and a new offer is made. So the contract isn't formed because there's no mutual agreement. So both D and E are talking about the response being a counter-offer or a new offer, which are essentially the same thing.

But let's look at the options again.

Option D says, "Not formed because Jones' response was a counter-offer." Option E says, "Not formed because the installment request constitutes a new offer."

In contract terms, a counter-offer is a new offer. So both D and E are correct in their reasoning. But I need to see which one is the more accurate answer.

Wait, the question is, "A contract was..." and the options are about why it wasn't formed. D and E both lead to the conclusion that no contract was formed.

But looking at the options, let's see what the other options are.

Option A says it's not formed because the addition was a rejection. That's correct because a conditional acceptance is treated as a rejection.

So A and D and E are all about the response not being an acceptance. So which is the correct reasoning?

In the common law, a conditional acceptance is a rejection. So when someone says, "I accept but only if..." that's a rejection. So in this case, Jones' response is a rejection because it's adding a condition. Therefore, the contract isn't formed because the response was a rejection, which is option A.

Alternatively, some might argue that it's a counter-offer, which would be option D. But I think the correct approach is that a conditional acceptance is a rejection, so the contract isn't formed because there's no valid acceptance.

Wait, but in this case, the response is not a conditional acceptance but rather a modification. Because Jones is not accepting the original terms but proposing a change. So it's a counter-offer, which is a new offer, not an acceptance.

So perhaps D is the correct answer because the response was a counter-offer, meaning no contract was formed.

Wait, but let me think again. In the original offer, Berg offered to sell for $75k cash. Jones says, "I accept but would like to pay in installments." So Jones is trying to change the payment terms. That's a modification, which is a counter-offer.

Therefore, the original offer is rejected, and a new offer is made by Jones. So the contract isn't formed because there's no meeting of minds on the same terms. So the correct reason is that the response was a counter-offer, making D the correct answer.

But wait, the question is whether a contract was formed. If Jones made a counter-offer, then unless Berg accepted that, there's no contract. So the answer would be that no contract was formed because the response was a counter-offer, which is option D.

Alternatively, option A says it's not formed because the addition was a rejection. But a counter-offer is a type of rejection. So both A and D could be correct. But in the options, A and D are separate.

Wait, no. Option A says the addition was a rejection, implying that the response was a rejection. But in reality, the response was a counter-offer, which is a form of rejection. So perhaps option D is more accurate because it's a counter-offer.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A because the response was a conditional acceptance, which is a rejection.

I think in this case, the correct reasoning is that Jones' response was a counter-offer, making D the correct answer. But I'm a bit confused because some sources say that a conditional acceptance is a rejection, making the contract not formed because of the rejection.

Wait, let me check. Under the common law, a conditional acceptance is treated as a counter-offer, which is a rejection of the original offer. So the contract isn't formed because the acceptance wasn't unconditional.

So in this case, Jones didn't accept the original offer; instead, they made a counter-offer. Therefore, the contract isn't formed because acceptance didn't occur. So the correct answer would be D: Not formed because Jones' response was a counter-offer.

Alternatively, E says it's not formed because the installment request is a new offer, which is correct because a counter-offer is a new offer. So E is also correct.

Wait, but the options are A through J, and I have to choose the best one. So which is more accurate?

I think both D and E are correct in their reasoning, but the question is about why the contract wasn't formed. So perhaps D is more precise because it directly states that the response was a counter-offer, which is a rejection. E says it's a new offer, which is also correct, but the key point is that a counter-offer doesn't form a contract unless the original offeror accepts it.

So looking back at the options, the answer is either A, D, or E.

But the key is that a conditional acceptance is a rejection, making the original offeror's offer dead, and the response is a counter-offer.

So the problem is whether the response was a rejection or a counter-offer. They are related but distinct.

In this case, when Jones said, "I accept but...", that's a conditional acceptance, which is a rejection. So option A is correct.

Alternatively, some might argue that it's a counter-offer, making D correct.

Hmm. I'm a bit torn. Let me think of a simple example. If I offer to sell you a house for $100k, and you say, "I accept but I want to pay in installments," that's a counter-offer, right? Because you're not accepting the terms as offered; you're changing the terms.

Therefore, the correct reasoning is that the response was a counter-offer, which is a new offer, so no contract was formed on the original terms. So the answer would be D or E.

But E says, "Not formed because the installment request constitutes a new offer." That's accurate because a counter-offer is a new offer. So E is correct.

Wait, but in the options, D and E are both correct in their reasoning. So which one is the better answer?

The question is about why the contract wasn't formed. The response was a counter-offer, which is a new offer, so neither party has accepted the other's offer. Therefore, the contract isn't formed.

Between D and E, I think E is more precise because it directly points out that the request was a new offer, which is why no contract was formed.

But wait, another angle: the original offer was in writing on March 1, sent via email. The response was a letter mailed on March 10, received on March 15. So when was the offer revoked?

Wait, no, because the original offer was a firm offer if it was in writing and for the sale of land, which falls under the Statute of Frauds. But the question is about whether a contract was formed, not about the enforceability.

But that's probably not relevant here. The main issue is whether the response was an acceptance or a counter-offer.

I think the correct answer is A: Not formed because the addition was a rejection. Because a conditional acceptance is a rejection, so no contract was formed.

Alternatively, D and E are also possible. But I think A is the correct answer because the response was a rejection, not an acceptance.

Wait, but in the case where someone says "I accept but with the following terms," that's a counter-offer, which is a rejection. So the contract isn't formed because the acceptance wasn't pure.

So perhaps the correct answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D because it's a counter-offer.

I'm a bit confused now. Let me see what the majority rule is. The majority rule is that a conditional acceptance is a counter-offer, which is a rejection. So the contract isn't formed because the response wasn't an acceptance.

Therefore, the correct answer is A: Not formed because the addition was, in effect, a rejection.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: when someone makes a conditional acceptance, it's treated as a counter-offer, which means the original offer is rejected. Therefore, the contract isn't formed because the acceptance wasn't absolute. So the correct reason is that the response was a rejection, making A correct.

Alternatively, some might argue that it's a counter-offer, making D correct.

But I think in this context, the correct answer is A.
</think>

The question revolves around whether a contract was formed when Jones responded to Berg's offer with a modified payment term. Under contract law, a conditional acceptance is treated as a rejection of the original offer, and any modification to the terms constitutes a counter-offer. Since Jones' response altered the payment terms, it was not a valid acceptance but rather a counter-offer. This means the original offer was rejected, and no contract was formed because there was no mutual agreement on the same terms. Therefore, the correct answer is that the contract was not formed because Jones' response was, in effect, a rejection.

Answer: A
