Okay, so I need to figure out which case best illustrates the 'living instrument principle' used by the European Court of Human Rights. Hmm, I remember that the living instrument principle is about interpreting human rights treaties in a way that's relevant to modern society, considering current conditions and values. It's not just sticking to the original text but evolving with the times.

Looking at the options, the cases are all from the ECHR. Let me think about each one.

A: Golder v UK (1978). I think Golder was about the right to a fair trial and legal privilege. The court held that legal advice was necessary for a fair hearing. That's important but not sure if it's about the living instrument principle.

B: A v UK (2009). This case involved a woman who was prosecuted for encouraging her husband to commit suicide. The court had to decide if this violated her right to freedom of expression. The ruling was that it did because it was a modern issue, and the court had to consider contemporary standards. This seems relevant because it's about adapting the interpretation of rights to current societal norms, which aligns with the living instrument principle.

C: Goodwin v UK (2002). Goodwin was about gender reassignment and whether discrimination against transsexuals was a breach of the right to respect for private life. The court found a breach, but I'm not sure if this case is about the living instrument principle specifically. It's more about the rights of transgender individuals.

D: Osman v UK (1998). Osman was about the right to life and the state's obligation to protect individuals from violence. The court ruled that the UK had failed to protect someone from a known threat. This is significant but more about the state's responsibilities than evolving interpretations of rights.

So, putting it together, the living instrument principle is about interpreting the Convention in a dynamic way. The A v UK (2009) case deals with a modern issue of free speech in the context of suicide, which likely required the court to consider current societal values and standards. That makes it the best example of the living instrument principle.

The correct answer is B: A v UK (2009). This case best illustrates the 'living instrument principle' as it involved interpreting rights in a contemporary context, reflecting modern societal norms.
