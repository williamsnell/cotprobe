Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, we have 40 grams of ice at 0°C being mixed with 100 grams of water at 60°C. We need to find the final temperature after they reach equilibrium. Hmm, I remember that when ice and water are mixed, heat transfer occurs until they reach the same temperature.

First, I should consider the heat of fusion for water, which is given as 80 cal/g. That means to melt 40 grams of ice, we'll need 40 * 80 calories. Let me calculate that: 40 * 80 is 3200 calories. So, the ice will require 3200 calories to completely melt into water at 0°C.

Now, the water at 60°C will lose heat as it cools down. The specific heat of water is 1 cal/g°C, so the heat lost by the hot water will be mass times specific heat times the change in temperature. The question is, will the hot water lose enough heat to melt all the ice, or will there still be some ice left, keeping the final temperature at 0°C?

Let me calculate how much heat the hot water can give. If all the ice melts, then the hot water would cool down to 0°C. So, the temperature change for the hot water would be 60°C - 0°C = 60°C. The heat released would be 100g * 1 cal/g°C * 60°C = 6000 calories.

Wait, but the ice needs 3200 calories to melt. Since 6000 calories is more than 3200, that means the hot water can provide enough heat to melt all the ice. So, after melting all the ice, we'll have 40g of water at 0°C and 100g of water at some higher temperature, but we need to find the final equilibrium temperature.

Wait, no, actually, once the ice melts, all the mass becomes water, so 40g + 100g = 140g of water. The final temperature will be somewhere between 0°C and 60°C. 

But wait, the heat lost by the hot water will equal the heat gained by the ice (to melt) plus the heat gained by the melted ice to warm up to the final temperature.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me think in terms of heat transfer. The ice needs to absorb heat to melt and then to warm up. The hot water will lose heat as it cools.

So, the heat absorbed by the ice has two parts: melting and then warming the melted water. But wait, if the hot water can provide enough heat to melt the ice and still have some left to warm the melted ice, then the final temp will be above 0°C. Otherwise, if the hot water can't even melt all the ice, the final temp would be 0°C.

But earlier, I saw that the hot water can provide 6000 calories, and the ice needs 3200 to melt. So, after melting, there's 6000 - 3200 = 2800 calories left. This remaining heat will be used to warm up the melted ice and the original hot water.

Wait, no. Actually, once the ice is melted, the melted water (40g) will be at 0°C, and the hot water (100g) will be at some lower temperature. The heat from the hot water will transfer to the melted ice to raise its temperature to the equilibrium temp.

Let me structure this properly.

Heat gained by ice to melt: Q1 = m_ice * H_fusion = 40g * 80 cal/g = 3200 cal.

Heat gained by melted ice to reach final temp T: Q2 = m_ice * c_water * (T - 0) = 40g * 1 cal/g°C * T = 40T cal.

Heat lost by hot water: Q3 = m_water * c_water * (60 - T) = 100g * 1 cal/g°C * (60 - T) = 100(60 - T) cal.

Since heat lost by hot water equals the heat gained by ice (both melting and warming):

Q1 + Q2 = Q3

So, 3200 + 40T = 100(60 - T)

Let me expand the right side: 6000 - 100T

So, 3200 + 40T = 6000 - 100T

Bring like terms together. Let's add 100T to both sides:

3200 + 140T = 6000

Subtract 3200 from both sides:

140T = 2800

Divide both sides by 140: T = 2800 / 140 = 20°C.

Wait, but that's one of the options. Option C is 20°C. So, the final temperature is 20°C.

To determine the final temperature when 40 g of ice at 0°C is mixed with 100 g of water at 60°C, we analyze the heat transfer between the two substances. The heat of fusion for water is 80 cal/g, and the specific heat of water is 1 cal/g°C.

1. **Heat required to melt the ice**:  
   The ice needs 40 g × 80 cal/g = 3200 cal to completely melt into water at 0°C.

2. **Heat available from the hot water**:  
   The hot water can release heat as it cools. If it were to cool to 0°C, it would release:  
   100 g × 1 cal/g°C × (60°C - 0°C) = 6000 cal.  

   Since 6000 cal > 3200 cal, the hot water can fully melt the ice and still have excess heat to raise the temperature of the melted ice.

3. **Heat transfer after melting**:  
   After melting, all 40 g of ice becomes water at 0°C. The total mass of water becomes 140 g (40 g + 100 g). The remaining heat from the hot water (6000 cal - 3200 cal = 2800 cal) will be used to raise the temperature of the 40 g of melted ice and the 100 g of hot water to the final equilibrium temperature, \( T \).

4. **Heat balance equation**:  
   Heat lost by the hot water = Heat gained by the melted ice.  
   \[
   100 \cdot (60 - T) = 40 \cdot T
   \]

5. **Solving for \( T \)**:  
   Expanding and rearranging:  
   \[
   6000 - 100T = 40T
   \]  
   \[
   6000 = 140T
   \]  
   \[
   T = \frac{6000}{140} = 20°C
   \]

Thus, the final temperature after equilibrium is established is **20°C**.
