Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about entropy and enthalpy changes when a solid melts. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on thermodynamics, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, when a solid melts, it's going from a solid state to a liquid. I remember that melting is a process that requires heat. So, the enthalpy change, which is the heat absorbed or released at constant pressure, should be positive because you're adding heat to the system. That makes sense because you have to put energy in to break the bonds in the solid to turn it into liquid.

Now, what about entropy? Entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness. Solids are highly ordered—molecules are in fixed positions. When they melt into a liquid, the molecules become more disordered. Liquids have higher entropy than solids. So the entropy change should be positive because the system becomes more disordered.

Putting that together, the process of melting should have a positive enthalpy change (since it's endothermic) and a positive entropy change (since disorder increases).

Looking at the options, option H says positive enthalpy change and positive entropy change. That fits what I'm thinking.

Wait, let me double-check. Other options: option A is positive enthalpy, negative entropy. No, because entropy should increase. Option I is negative entropy and positive enthalpy—no, same issue. Option H is the only one that matches both being positive.

When a solid melts, it absorbs heat (endothermic process), resulting in a positive enthalpy change. Additionally, the transition from a highly ordered solid to a less ordered liquid increases entropy. Therefore, both changes are positive.

Answer: H
