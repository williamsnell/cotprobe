Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to figure out how many men are needed to build a boat in 77 days, given that 36 men take 132 days to build one. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that work problems often involve the concept of man-days, which is the total amount of work done. So, if 36 men take 132 days, the total work would be 36 multiplied by 132. Let me calculate that. 36 times 100 is 3600, and 36 times 32 is 1152, so adding those together gives 4752 man-days. So, building one boat requires 4752 man-days of work.

Now, the question is asking how many men are needed to do the same amount of work in 77 days. Since the total work is the same, the number of men multiplied by 77 days should equal 4752 man-days. So, the equation would be men * 77 = 4752. To find the number of men, I need to divide 4752 by 77.

Let me do the division. 77 times 60 is 4620 because 70*60=4200 and 7*60=420, adding up to 4620. Subtracting that from 4752 gives 132. Now, 77 goes into 132 once, because 77*1=77, leaving a remainder of 55. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should try another approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can simplify the fraction 4752/77. Let me see if both numbers can be divided by something. Let's check if 77 divides into 4752. 77 times 61 is 4697 because 70*60=4200, 70*1=70, so 4200+70=4270, plus 7*61=427. Wait, that's getting confusing. Maybe I should do it step by step.

Let me try dividing 4752 by 77. 77 goes into 475 how many times? 77*6=462, which is less than 475. 77*6=462, subtract that from 475, which leaves 13. Bring down the next digit, which is 2, making it 132. 77 goes into 132 once (77), leaving 55. Now bring down the next digit, which is 0 since 4752 is the end. So we have 550. 77 goes into 550 how many times? 77*7=539, which is less than 550. So 7 times, which gives 539. Subtract, and we have 11 left. Wait, but we've already used up all the digits, so the division would be 61.64... approximately.

Wait, that can't be right because the number of men should be a whole number. Did I make a mistake in the initial calculation? Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I should simplify the fraction 4752/77. Let me see if both numbers have a common factor. 77 is 7*11. Does 7 divide into 4752? Let's check. 7*600=4200, 4752-4200=552. 7*78=546, so 552-546=6, so no, 7 doesn't divide into 4752 exactly. How about 11? Let's check 4752 divided by 11. 11*400=4400, 4752-4400=352. 11*32=352, so 400+32=432. So 4752=11*432. And 77=7*11, so 4752/77 = (11*432)/(7*11) = 432/7. 432 divided by 7 is approximately 61.714, which is about 61.71 men. But that's not an option. The options are all whole numbers, so perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of inverse proportionality. If more men are working, the time taken decreases. So, if time is inversely proportional to the number of men, then men1 * days1 = men2 * days2. So 36 men * 132 days = men2 * 77 days. So men2 = (36 * 132)/77.

Let me calculate that. 36 *132 is 4752, as before. Divided by 77. So 4752 รท77. Let me compute that more accurately.

Let me try 77 * 61: 70*60=4200, 70*1=70, 7*60=420, 7*1=7. So 77*60=4620, 77*1=77, so 77*61=4620+77=4697. 4752-4697=55. So 55/77=0.714. So 61.714, which is about 61.71 men. But looking at the options, the closest whole number isn't there. The options are A:84, B:36, C:99, D:132, E:45, F:70, G:62, H:50, I:77, J:120.

Wait, so 62 is option G. But maybe I should check if I messed up the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the rate per man per day.

Each man contributes 1/(36*132) of the work per day. So the work required is 1 boat. So the number of men needed would be 1/( (1/(36*132)) * days ). So men = (36*132)/days. So with days=77, men=(36*132)/77.

Let me compute 36*132 first. 36*100=3600, 36*32=1152, so total 4752. Then 4752 รท77. Let me see if 77 goes into 4752 exactly. 77*61=4697, as before. 4752-4697=55. 55 is 77*(5/7), so 55/77=5/7. So 4752/77=61 and 5/7, which is approximately 61.714. So 62 men when rounded up, but the options have G as 62. But wait, none of the options match exactly. But perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should simplify 4752 รท77. Let's see: 77 * 60 = 4620. 4752 -4620=132. 77 goes into 132 once, so that's 61, and 132-77=55. So 61 + 55/77 = 61.714. So that's 61 and 5/7 men, which isn't an option. But looking at the options, the closest is G:62. But wait, perhaps I should check if 77 divides into 4752 exactly. Let me try 77 * 62. 70*62=4340, 7*62=434, so 4340+434=4774. That's more than 4752. So 62 men would take 4752/62 days. Let me compute that: 62*76=4712, 4752-4712=40. So 76 days and 40/62 of a day. Which is approximately 76.645 days. But the question wants it done in 77 days, so 62 men would finish in about 76.65 days, which is just under 77. So maybe 62 men are sufficient because 62*77=4754, which is slightly more than 4752. So 62 men would complete the work in 77 days. So the correct answer is G:62.

To determine the number of men needed to build a boat in 77 days, given that 36 men take 132 days, we use the concept of man-days. The total work required is 36 men ร 132 days = 4752 man-days. To complete the same work in 77 days, the number of men required is calculated as:

\[
\text{Men} = \frac{4752 \text{ man-days}}{77 \text{ days}} \approx 61.71 \text{ men}.
\]

Since the number of men must be a whole number, rounding up to 62 men ensures the work is completed within 77 days. Therefore, the answer is:

G
