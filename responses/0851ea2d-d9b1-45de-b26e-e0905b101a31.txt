Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question is about a lead bullet that melts when it strikes a steel slab. I need to find the speed 'v' of the bullet. The given data includes the initial temperature of the bullet, T0 = 300 K, its melting point T1 = 700 K, the heat of melting q = 5 cal/g, and the specific heat c = 0.03 cal/g·K. The options are from A to J, with various speeds in meters per second.

Hmm, so I think this is a problem involving the conversion of kinetic energy into heat energy. The bullet's kinetic energy upon impact is converted into heat, which raises its temperature until it reaches the melting point, and then it melts. So I need to calculate the speed at which the bullet's kinetic energy is just enough to raise its temperature from 300 K to 700 K and also provide the energy required to melt it.

Wait, but wait, the heat of melting is the energy needed to change the state from solid to liquid at the melting point. So the total heat required would be the sum of two parts: the energy to raise the temperature from T0 to T1, and then the energy to melt it at T1.

So first, I need to find the mass of the bullet. Wait, but the problem doesn't give the mass directly. Hmm, maybe the mass will cancel out in the equations, or perhaps I can express everything in terms of mass and see how it goes.

Let me denote the mass as 'm' grams. The specific heat c is given as 0.03 cal/(g·K), and q is 5 cal/g. So the energy required to raise the temperature from 300 K to 700 K is the heat needed for that temperature change. The formula for heat is Q = m * c * ΔT. Here, ΔT is T1 - T0, which is 700 - 300 = 400 K.

So Q1 = m * 0.03 cal/(g·K) * 400 K = m * 0.03 * 400 = m * 12 cal.

Then, the energy to melt the bullet once it's at T1 is Q2 = m * q = m * 5 cal.

So the total heat Q_total needed is Q1 + Q2 = 12m + 5m = 17m cal.

Now, the kinetic energy (KE) of the bullet when it strikes is given by KE = (1/2)mv². But wait, since I'm using grams for mass, I should make sure the units are consistent. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to convert everything into SI units. Let me think about that.

Wait, but the heat is given in calories, so I might need to convert the kinetic energy into calories as well. Alternatively, I can equate the kinetic energy in joules to the heat energy in joules. Let me see.

Wait, 1 calorie is approximately 4.184 joules. So I can calculate the total heat in joules and then set that equal to the kinetic energy in joules.

So Q_total in joules is (17m cal) * 4.184 J/cal.

The kinetic energy is (1/2)m*v², where m is in kilograms. Wait, but I've used grams earlier, so maybe I should convert grams to kilograms. Let me adjust that.

Let me denote m as the mass in grams. So m kg is m/1000 kg.

So KE = (1/2) * (m/1000 kg) * v².

Set KE equal to Q_total in joules:

(1/2) * (m/1000) * v² = (17m cal) * 4.184 J/cal.

Wait, but I can cancel m from both sides because it's on both sides. Let me see:

(1/2) * (m/1000) * v² = 17m * 4.184.

Divide both sides by m:

(1/2) * (1/1000) * v² = 17 * 4.184.

Simplify the left side: (v²) / (2000) = 17 * 4.184.

Calculate the right side: 17 * 4.184 ≈ 17 * 4.184 ≈ let me compute that.

4.184 * 10 is 41.84, so 4.184 *17: 10*4.184=41.84, 7*4.184=29.288, so total is 71.128.

So (v²)/2000 = 71.128.

Multiply both sides by 2000: v² = 71.128 * 2000.

Calculate that: 71.128 * 2000 = 142,256.

So v = sqrt(142256). Let me find the square root of 142256.

Well, 377^2 is 142,129 (since 400^2=160,000, 380^2=144,400, so 377^2: 370^2=136,900, 377^2= (370+7)^2 = 370² + 2*370*7 + 7² = 136900 + 5180 +49 = 142,129). 

Wait, 377^2 is 142,129, which is less than 142,256. The difference is 142256 -142129= 127.

So next, 378^2: 377^2 + 2*377 +1 = 142129 +754 +1=142884. Hmm, that's higher than 142,256. So 377.5^2?

Wait, maybe I can compute it more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, let me double-check the earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So:

Q_total = 17m cal → in joules, that's 17m *4.184 J.

KE = (1/2) m v², but here m is in kg. So m in kg is m_g /1000, where m_g is mass in grams.

So KE = (1/2) * (m_g /1000) * v².

Set KE = Q_total (in J):

(1/2) * (m_g /1000) * v² = 17 * m_g *4.184

Divide both sides by m_g:

(1/2) * (1/1000) * v² = 17 * 4.184

Multiply both sides by 2000:

v² = 17 *4.184 *2000

Wait, I think I may have made a mistake in the earlier calculation. Because 17 *4.184 is 71.128, and 71.128 * 2000 is 142,256, which is correct.

So v² = 142256 → v = sqrt(142256) → Let me compute that again. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps use a calculator approach. Let me compute sqrt(142256).

Well, 377^2=142,129 as before. 377.5^2=?

377.5^2 = (377 + 0.5)^2 = 377^2 + 2*377*0.5 + 0.5^2 = 142,129 + 377 + 0.25 = 142,506.25.

Wait, but 142,256 is between 377^2 (142,129) and 377.5^2 (142,506.25). Let me compute 377.2^2.

377.2^2 = (377 + 0.2)^2 = 377^2 + 2*377*0.2 + 0.2^2 = 142129 + 150.8 + 0.04 = 142279.84.

Hmm, that's higher than 142,256. Let me try 377.1^2.

377.1^2 = (377 + 0.1)^2 = 377^2 + 2*377*0.1 + 0.01 = 142129 + 75.4 + 0.01 = 142204.41.

So 377.1^2=142204.41, which is less than 142,256. The difference is 142,256 -142,204.41 = 51.59.

So between 377.1 and 377.2. Let's find x such that (377.1 + x)^2 = 142,256. Expanding, 377.1^2 + 2*377.1*x + x² = 142,256.

We have 377.1^2 =142204.41. So 142204.41 + 2*377.1*x +x² =142256.

Thus, 2*377.1*x ≈ 142256 -142204.41 =51.59.

So 754.2 x ≈51.59 → x ≈51.59 /754.2 ≈0.0684.

So v ≈377.1 +0.0684≈377.168 m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the highest speed is 500 m/s, but my calculation gives around 377 m/s. Hmm, but none of the options exactly match that. The options are A:420, B:450, C:500, D:380, E:400, F:300, G:350, H:275, I:320, J:340.

Wait, option D is 380 m/s, which is close to my 377.17, but not exactly. Maybe I made a miscalculation in the steps.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the KE equation. Let me go through the equations again.

The heat required is Q = m * c * (T1 - T0) + m * q.

So Q = m*(0.03 cal/gK *400 K) + m *5 cal/g = m*(12 +5) cal =17m cal.

Now, KE is (1/2)mv², but when converting to calories, 1 cal =4.184 J.

So KE in J is (1/2)mv², and Q in J is 17m *4.184.

Set them equal: (1/2)mv² = 17m *4.184.

Cancel m: (1/2)v² =17 *4.184 → v²= 2 *17 *4.184.

Wait a second, I think I missed the 2 earlier. Oh no, I see now. So earlier, when I equated KE = Q, I had:

(1/2)*m*v² (in J) = m *17 *4.184 J.

Wait, but m is in grams. Wait no, wait a second, I think I messed up the units earlier. Let me clarify.

Let me denote m as mass in grams. Then, m in kg is m_g /1000.

So KE = (1/2) * (m_g /1000) * v² (in J).

Q is 17 m_g cal, which in J is 17 m_g *4.184.

So equation: (1/2) * (m_g /1000) * v² =17 m_g *4.184.

Divide both sides by m_g: (1/2) * (1/1000) v² =17 *4.184.

Multiply both sides by 2000: v² = 17 *4.184 *2000.

Wait, 17 *4.184 is 71.128. Then 71.128 *2000=142,256.

So v²=142256 → v=√142256= 377.17 m/s.

Wait, but that's what I had earlier. So the speed is approximately 377 m/s. Looking at the options, option D is 380 m/s, which is the closest. So perhaps the answer is D.

Wait, but why is my calculation giving 377 m/s when option D is 380? Maybe I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let me recalculate 17 *4.184 *2000.

Wait, 17 *4.184 = 71.128. 71.128 *2000 = 142,256. Correct.

So v= sqrt(142256) = 377.17 m/s.

Hmm, perhaps the options are rounded, or maybe I made an error in the specific heat or the heat of fusion.

Wait, checking the problem statement again: specific heat c=0.03 cal/(g·K), heat of melting q=5 cal/g.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the bullet doesn't just reach the melting point but actually melts, so perhaps the temperature doesn't go beyond T1. But in any case, the calculation seems correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the speed is given in m/s, but I might have made a mistake in unit conversions.

Wait, let me think again. I converted the mass to kg correctly, and the energy into joules. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the energy without converting to joules. Let me try that approach.

So, the kinetic energy in calories would be KE_cal = (1/2)mv² * (1 cal /4.184 J).

Wait, no, perhaps I should compute KE in calories and set it equal to Q in calories.

So KE = (1/2)mv² (in J) → in calories, that's (1/2)mv² /4.184.

Set this equal to Q in calories, which is 17m.

So (1/2 mv²)/4.184 =17m.

Cancel m: (v²)/(2*4.184) =17.

Multiply both sides by 2*4.184: v² =17 *2*4.184.

Compute that: 17*2=34 → 34*4.184=142.256.

So v²=142.256 → v= sqrt(142.256) ≈11.93 m/s. Wait, that can't be right because the options are in hundreds of m/s. So I must have messed up the unit conversion here.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the unit conversion when setting KE in calories. Let me rethink this.

Wait, no, I think the mistake is that I forgot to convert mass from grams to kilograms. Let me try this again.

Alternatively, perhaps the KE in calories is (1/2) m (g) v² (m/s)^2 * (1 cal / (g·cm²)).

Wait, because 1 cal = 1 g·cm²/s². So to convert KE from J to cal, since 1 J = 1 kg·m²/s², and 1 cal = 1 g·cm²/s² → 1 cal = 1e-3 kg * (0.01 m)^2 /s² = 1e-7 kg·m²/s².

So 1 J = 1 kg·m²/s² = 1e7 cal.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 1 cal = 4.184 J → 1 J = 1/4.184 cal ≈0.238 cal.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the unit conversion correctly.

So KE in J is (1/2)mv², where m is in kg, v in m/s.

To convert to cal: KE_cal = KE_J /4.184.

Set KE_cal = Q in cal, which is 17m (since m is in grams).

Wait, but m is in grams, so let me write m_g for grams.

So KE_J = (1/2) * (m_g /1000) * v².

Then, KE_cal = KE_J /4.184 = [ (1/2)(m_g/1000) v² ] /4.184.

Set equal to Q =17 m_g cal.

So:

[ (1/2)(m_g/1000) v² ] /4.184 =17 m_g.

Cancel m_g:

(1/2) v² / (1000 *4.184) )=17.

Multiply both sides by 1000*4.184 *2:

v² = 17 * 2 *1000 *4.184.

Compute that: 17 *2=34 → 34 *1000=34,000 → 34,000 *4.184.

Compute 34,000 *4 =136,000 → 34,000 *0.184=6,256 → total 136,000 +6,256=142,256.

So v²=142,256 → v=√142256≈377.17 m/s.

So same result as before. So the speed is approximately 377 m/s. Looking back at the options, option D is 380 m/s, which is the closest. So I think the correct answer is D:380 m/s.
</think>

The problem involves determining the speed of a lead bullet that melts upon striking a steel slab. The bullet's initial temperature is 300 K, melting point is 700 K, heat of melting is 5 cal/g, and specific heat is 0.03 cal/(g·K). The total heat required to raise the bullet's temperature to its melting point and then melt it is calculated as:

\[
Q_{\text{total}} = m \cdot c \cdot \Delta T + m \cdot q = m \cdot (0.03 \cdot 400) + m \cdot 5 = 17m \, \text{cal}.
\]

Converting this heat to joules (\(1 \, \text{cal} = 4.184 \, \text{J}\)):

\[
Q_{\text{total}} = 17m \cdot 4.184 \, \text{J}.
\]

The bullet's kinetic energy upon impact is:

\[
KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2,
\]

where \(m\) is in kilograms. Setting \(KE = Q_{\text{total}}\), substituting \(m = \frac{m_g}{1000}\) (with \(m_g\) in grams), and simplifying:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{m_g}{1000} \cdot v^2 = 17m_g \cdot 4.184.
\]

Canceling \(m_g\) and solving for \(v^2\):

\[
v^2 = 17 \cdot 4.184 \cdot 2000 = 142256 \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v = \sqrt{142256} \approx 377.17 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

Among the given options, the closest value is **380 m/s**, corresponding to option **D**.
