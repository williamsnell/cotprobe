Okay, so I need to figure out which statement about the function f(x) = x³ + 2x² – 9x – 18 is true. Let's take it step by step.

First, maybe I should find the derivative to determine where the function is increasing or decreasing. The derivative f’(x) will tell me the slope. Let me compute that.

f’(x) = 3x² + 4x – 9.

Now, to find critical points, I'll set f’(x) = 0 and solve for x.

3x² +4x –9 =0.

Using the quadratic formula: x = [-4 ± sqrt(16 + 108)] / (2*3) = [-4 ± sqrt(124)]/6. Simplify sqrt(124) to 2*sqrt(31), so x = [-4 ± 2√31]/6 = [-2 ± √31]/3.

So the critical points are at x ≈ (-2 + 5.567)/3 ≈ 3.567/3 ≈ 1.19 and x ≈ (-2 -5.567)/3 ≈ -7.567/3 ≈ -2.52.

So the function has critical points at around x ≈ -2.52 and x ≈ 1.19. Now, I can analyze the intervals around these points to see where f is increasing or decreasing.

Let's pick test points:

For x < -2.52, say x = -3: f’(-3) = 3*(9) +4*(-3) –9 = 27-12-9=6>0. So increasing.

Between -2.52 and 1.19, say x=0: f’(0)=0+0-9=-9 <0. So decreasing.

For x >1.19, say x=2: f’(2)=12 +8 –9=11>0. Increasing.

So the function is increasing on (-∞, -2.52), decreasing on (-2.52,1.19), and increasing again on (1.19, ∞).

Now let's look at the options:

A: f decreasing for x ≥3. Since for x>1.19, it's increasing, so at x=3, it's increasing. So A is false.

B: f(x)=0 has two real solutions. Wait, cubic functions have at least one real root. But depending on the graph, maybe more. Let me think. Or maybe factor f(x). Let me try factoring.

f(x)=x³ +2x² -9x -18. Let's try possible rational roots using Rational Root Theorem: possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±3, etc. Let's test x=3: 27 + 18 -27 -18=0. So x=3 is a root. So we can factor (x-3) out.

Using polynomial division or synthetic division:

Divide f(x) by (x-3). Coefficients: 1 (x³), 2(x²), -9(x), -18.

Using synthetic division:

3 | 1  2  -9  -18
          3   15   18
      1  5   6    0

So f(x)=(x-3)(x² +5x +6). Now factor x² +5x +6=(x+2)(x+3). So f(x)=(x-3)(x+2)(x+3). So the roots are x=3, x=-2, x=-3. So three real roots. So B is wrong (it says two), and F says three, so F is correct. But let me check all options.

C: f(x) ≥ -18 for all x≥0. Let's see. At x=0, f(0)=-18. And since for x>1.19, the function is increasing, and as x approaches infinity, f(x) goes to infinity. So the minimum at x=1.19 is f(1.19). Let me compute f(1.19):

But maybe I can check f(x) at x=1: f(1)=1+2-9-18= -24. So at x=1, f(x)=-24, which is less than -18. So C is false because for x≥0, it's not always ≥-18.

D: f(x) increasing for x≥-3. Let's see, the function is increasing from x=-3 to x=-2.52? Wait no. Let me check the intervals.

x ≥-3: the function is increasing from x=-3 to x=-2.52, then decreasing from -2.52 to 1.19, then increasing again beyond 1.19. So the function isn't always increasing for x≥-3. So D is false.

E: Function decreasing for x ≤-3. Let's see, for x ≤-3, which is less than -2.52 (since -3 is less than -2.52), and in that interval, the function is increasing, as we saw earlier. So E is false.

F: f(x)=0 has three real solutions. As we factored, yes, with roots at x=3, -2, -3. So F is correct.

G: f(x) ≤-18 for all x ≤0. Let's check x=0: f(0)=-18. For x=-1, f(-1)= -1 +2 +9 -18= -8, which is greater than -18. So G is false.

H: f(x) >-18 for all x<0. Let's see, at x=0, it's -18. For x approaching 0 from the left, say x=-0.1: f(-0.1)= (-0.001) + 0.02 + 0.9 -18≈ -17.081, which is greater than -18. But wait, what about at x=-2: f(-2)= -8 +8 +18 -18=0, which is >-18. Wait, but wait, when x approaches -3 from the right, say x=-3.0001, f(x) would be (negative large cube term) which might be less than -18. Wait, but x=-3 is a root, so f(-3)= (-3)^3 + 2*(-3)^2 –9*(-3) –18= -27 + 18 +27 -18= 0. So at x=-3, f(x)=0. Let me check x=-4: f(-4)= (-64) + 2*(16) –9*(-4) –18= -64 +32 +36 –18= (-64+32)= -32; (36-18)=18; total -32+18=-14. So f(-4)=-14> -18. Hmm, but wait, as x approaches negative infinity, x³ dominates, so f(x) approaches negative infinity. So for x very negative, f(x) will be less than -18. So H is false because for some x <0, f(x) ≤-18. For example, x=-10: f(-10)= -1000 + 200 +90 -18= -1000+200 is -800; +90 is -710; -18 is -728, which is way below -18. So H is false.

I: f(x) ≤0 for all x ≤-3. Let's see. At x=-3, f(x)=0. For x < -3, say x=-4, f(-4)= -64 +32 +36 -18= (-64+32)= -32; 36-18=18; total -14>0. So at x=-4, f(x)= -14>0, so I is false.

J: f(x)=0 has no real solutions. But we know it has three, so J is false.

So the correct option is F.
</think>

The function f(x) = x³ + 2x² – 9x – 18 is analyzed to determine which statement is true. By factoring, it is found that f(x) has three real roots: x = 3, x = -2, and x = -3. This makes option F correct, as f(x) = 0 has three real solutions. Other options are evaluated and found to be incorrect based on the function's behavior and roots.

Answer: F
