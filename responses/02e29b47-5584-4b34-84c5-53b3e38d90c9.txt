F: 3, Deflationary period
G: 1.5, Not enough information
H: 1.25, Inflationary period
I: 2, Not enough information
J: 1, Not enough information

Okay, so I have this economics question to solve. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll take it slowly.

The question is about calculating the price level and determining whether last year was an inflationary or deflationary period. The given data includes the output of goods and services in real terms, the money supply, and the velocity of money. 

First, I remember that there's a formula connecting these variables. I think it's the equation of exchange, which is part of the quantity theory of money. The formula is usually written as:

M * V = P * Y

Where:
- M is the money supply
- V is the velocity of money
- P is the price level
- Y is the output of goods and services (real GDP, I think)

So, the question gives me:
- Output (Y) = $1600 billion
- Money supply (M) = $500 billion
- Velocity (V) = 4

I need to find P, the price level. Rearranging the equation to solve for P, it becomes:

P = (M * V) / Y

Plugging in the numbers:

P = (500 * 4) / 1600

Let me calculate that. 500 times 4 is 2000. Then, 2000 divided by 1600 is... Hmm, 2000/1600 is the same as 20/16, which simplifies to 5/4, which is 1.25. So P is 1.25.

Wait, but what's the base period for the price level? Oh, right, the price level is relative to some base year. But since we're given real output, I think the formula gives the current price level relative to that base year. So P is 1.25 times the base year's price level.

Now, the second part of the question is whether it's an inflationary or deflationary period. That depends on whether the price level is rising or falling compared to the base year. If P is greater than 1, it means prices have gone up, which is inflation. If it's less than 1, prices have fallen, which is deflation.

In this case, P is 1.25, which is higher than 1. So, that suggests an inflationary period.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one where P is 1.25 and it's inflationary. Let's check the options:

Option A: 1.25, Not enough info — Hmm, but we have enough info because we calculated P and it's higher than 1, so it's inflationary, not just not enough info.

Option H: 1.25, Inflationary period — That fits both the price level and the period.

Other options don't match. For example, option B has P=0.8, which would be deflation, but that's not our case. Option D says stable prices with P=2, which doesn't match our calculation.

So, the correct answer should be option H: 1.25, Inflationary period.

The price level is calculated using the equation of exchange: \( P = \frac{M \times V}{Y} \). Substituting the given values, \( P = \frac{500 \times 4}{1600} = 1.25 \). Since the price level is above 1, it indicates an inflationary period.

Answer: H
