Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about estimation techniques for over-identified systems of simultaneous equations. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that over-identified means there are more instruments than endogenous variables. In simultaneous equations models, we often deal with endogeneity, so we need methods that can handle that.

The question lists four techniques: OLS, ILS, 2SLS, and IV. I need to figure out which of these are valid for over-identified systems.

Starting with OLS. I know that OLS is the ordinary least squares method. But in the context of simultaneous equations, OLS isn't consistent because it doesn't account for endogeneity. However, in just-identified models, two-stage least squares (2SLS) is used, but OLS isn't. Wait, but the question is about over-identified, so OLS probably isn't an option here. Or is it? Maybe in some cases OLS is still used, but I think it's not consistent. So maybe OLS isn't an available method for over-identified systems.

Next, ILS. I'm a bit fuzzy on ILS. I think ILS stands for Iterative Least Squares. But I'm not sure how that works. Wait, no, ILS might be another term for something else. Alternatively, ILS could be related to instrumental variables. Wait, no, ILS isn't a standard term I'm familiar with. Maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, ILS could stand for something else, like Indirect Least Squares. Oh wait, that's another method. Indirect Least Squares (ILS) is a method used in simultaneous equations. It's an alternative to 2SLS and is consistent in just-identified models. But does it work for over-identified systems? I think ILS can be applied when the system is just-identified or over-identified. So ILS is an option.

Then, 2SLS. That's definitely a method for over-identified systems. 2SLS is commonly used when you have more instruments than endogenous variables. It's a two-step process where you first run OLS on the instruments to get their effect and then use those estimates in the second stage. So 2SLS is definitely applicable here.

IV stands for Instrumental Variables. IV estimation is a method where you use instruments to estimate the effect of variables that are endogenous. IV can be applied in different scenarios, including over-identified systems. When you have more instruments than endogenous variables, IV estimation can still be done, and it's often used in that context. So IV is also a valid method here.

Now, putting it all together. The question is which of these are available for over-identified systems. So:

i) OLS: Not applicable because OLS isn't consistent in simultaneous equations unless it's just-identified, but even then, 2SLS is preferred. So I don't think OLS is used here.

ii) ILS: Yes, because ILS can handle over-identified systems.

iii) 2SLS: Yes, definitely applicable.

iv) IV: Yes, IV can be used in over-identified cases.

So the techniques that apply are ii, iii, and iv. Looking at the options, option C is (ii), (iii), and (iv) only. Option B is (i), (iii), and (iv) only, but I don't think OLS is correct.

Wait, but I should double-check whether ILS is applicable in over-identified systems. From what I recall, ILS is used in just-identified and over-identified cases because it relies on the number of instruments being sufficient. It doesn't require the system to be just-identified, so yes, it's applicable. Therefore, the correct answer should include ii, iii, iv.

Looking back at the options, option C is ii, iii, iv.

The estimation techniques available for over-identified systems of simultaneous equations include methods that address endogeneity and utilize instruments. OLS is not suitable as it is inconsistent in such systems. ILS, 2SLS, and IV are valid techniques. Therefore, the correct answer is C.

Answer: C
