Question:

One group of compounds that may become quite important in birth control is the prostaglandins. What are the advantages of prostaglandins in birth control?

Options:

A: Prostaglandins are used to enhance mood and have no effect on birth control.
B: Prostaglandins increase fertility by promoting ovulation.
C: Prostaglandins are able to prevent pregnancy by altering the DNA of the sperm and egg.
D: Prostaglandins are known to mediate hormonal action
E: Prostaglandins are non-hormonal, reducing the risk of hormonal side effects.
F: Prostaglandins can be taken orally once a month, providing long-term birth control.
G: Prostaglandins are cyclic, oxygenated, 20-carbon fatty acids
H: Prostaglandins induce strong contractions in the uterus, prevent the fertilized ovum from being implanted, and can be introduced directly into the uterus, making them potentially safer contraceptives than oral chemical agents.
I: Prostaglandins improve skin condition and are used as a beauty supplement.
J: Prostaglandins are efficient in treating nasal congestion

Okay, so I have this question about prostaglandins and their role in birth control. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Prostaglandins are lipid compounds that have various roles in the body, including inflammation and reproductive processes. I remember that they play a role in the menstrual cycle and childbirth because they can cause uterine contractions.

The question is asking about the advantages of prostaglandins in birth control. Let's look at the options.

Option A: Prostaglandins enhance mood and have no effect on birth control. Hmm, I don't recall prostaglandins being used for mood enhancement. Plus, the question is about their use in birth control, so A seems irrelevant.

Option B: They increase fertility by promoting ovulation. Wait, that doesn't make sense because if they promote ovulation, they'd help with conception, not prevent it. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C: Prevent pregnancy by altering DNA of sperm and egg. I don't think prostaglandins work by changing DNA. They're more about physiological actions like contractions, so C is likely wrong.

Option D: Mediate hormonal action. I know prostaglandins act locally, not through hormones, so D might not be the best answer. They don't mediate hormones but influence other processes.

Option E: Non-hormonal, reducing risk of hormonal side effects. Oh, that sounds plausible. Since they don't involve hormones, they might have fewer side effects compared to hormonal contraceptives like the pill.

Option F: Taken orally once a month for long-term control. Wait, prostaglandins are usually instilled into the uterus, not taken orally. Oral use might not be effective or could cause issues elsewhere. So F is probably incorrect.

Option G: Describe their structure as cyclic, oxygenated, 20-carbon fatty acids. That's correct in terms of structure, but the question is about advantages in birth control, not their structure. So G isn't the right answer here.

Option H: Induce strong contractions, prevent implantation, and can be introduced directly into the uterus, making them safer than oral agents. This makes sense. Prostaglandins can cause contractions that prevent implantation. If used locally in the uterus, they might be a safer method because they don't affect the entire body like oral contraceptives, which have systemic side effects.

Option I: Improve skin and used as a beauty supplement. Not related to birth control, so I is wrong.

Option J: Treat nasal congestion. That's a different use, so J isn't the answer.

So, looking at the options, E and H are the more plausible correct answers. The question is about the advantages, so while E is a good point about being non-hormonal, H explains a specific mechanism and method of use that makes them safer.

I think the best answer is H because it directly addresses how prostaglandins function in preventing pregnancy and their advantage in terms of application.

The correct answer is H: Prostaglandins induce strong contractions in the uterus, prevent the fertilized ovum from being implanted, and can be introduced directly into the uterus, making them potentially safer contraceptives than oral chemical agents.

Answer: H
