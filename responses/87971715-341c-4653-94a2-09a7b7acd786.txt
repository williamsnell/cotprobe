Question:

Kohler's studies with apes are seen as demonstrating

Options:

A: that apes are able to use objects from their natural environment as tools.
B: that apes can learn through operant conditioning.
C: that learning can occur via insight.
D: the apes' ability to communicate.
E: latent learning in primates.
F: the apes' ability to recognize themselves in a mirror.
G: that apes are capable of abstract thinking.
H: the apes' ability to mimic human behavior.
I: the apes' ability to solve complex mathematical problems.
J: that apes have a basic understanding of human languages.

Okay, so I need to figure out which option correctly describes Kohler's studies with apes. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that Kohler was a psychologist who studied primates. His work was in the early 20th century, right? I think it's related to how apes learn and solve problems.

Wait, Kohler is known for his work on insight learning. Insight learning is when an animal suddenly understands how to solve a problem, like figuring out the right approach without trial and error. He worked with apes, like chimpanzees, and observed their problem-solving behaviors.

One of the famous experiments I recall involved a chimp named Sultan. If I remember correctly, in one setup, there was a banana hanging out of reach, and there were two sticks. The sticks were too short individually to reach the banana, but when combined, they could be used together to get the banana. Initially, Sultan tried using each stick separately but couldn't reach. Then, after some time, he figured out to combine them, which allowed him to get the banana. This showed that he had an insight moment, understanding how to use the sticks together.

So, looking at the options:

A: Using natural environment tools. That's more about tool use, which apes do, but I think that's not specifically what Kohler demonstrated. He showed problem-solving through insight.

B: Operant conditioning. No, that's Skinner's work, not Kohler. Operant conditioning is about learning through rewards and punishments, which is different from insight.

C: Learning via insight. Yes, this aligns with what I remember about Kohler's experiments. He demonstrated that apes can solve problems through sudden understanding, which is insight learning.

D: Communication. I don't think that's the focus here. Kohler's work was more about problem-solving and learning mechanisms.

E: Latent learning. Latent learning is about learning that isn't immediately expressed, like Thorndike's experiments where cats explored mazes without an obvious reward. Not sure if that's what Kohler showed.

F: Mirror recognition. That's more about the cognitive ability to recognize oneself, tested by the mirror test, which I think was done by others, like Gallup.

G: Abstract thinking. While apes are intelligent, Kohler's specific demonstration was about insight learning, not necessarily abstract thinking.

H: Mimicry. Again, not related to Kohler's findings.

I: Math problems. That's way beyond what Kohler studied. He focused on problem-solving, not mathematical abilities.

J: Understanding human language. That's more about language comprehension, which isn't what Kohler's work was about.

So the correct answer should be option C: that learning can occur via insight.

The correct answer is C: that learning can occur via insight. Kohler's studies with apes demonstrated insight learning, where the apes solved problems through sudden understanding rather than trial and error.

Answer:
C
