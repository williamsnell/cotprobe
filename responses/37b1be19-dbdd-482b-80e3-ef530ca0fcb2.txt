Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about felony murder. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

Alright, the question is about a defendant charged with felony murder because he set fire to the victim's house. The victim was upstairs sleeping and died in his bedroom during the fire. The question is asking which assertion, if proven, would least likely remove liability for felony murder.

I remember that felony murder typically involves committing a felony that results in a death, and the felony here is setting the fire. So the defendant is being held responsible for the victim's death because it happened during the commission of that felony.

Now, the options are A to F. I need to figure out which one, if the defendant can prove it, wouldn't help him avoid liability. So the least likely to remove liability.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: The defendant was coerced by another to set the fire. Hmm, coercion. I think this relates to duress. If someone else forced him to set the fire, maybe that could be a defense. But I'm not sure if duress applies to felony murder. I think duress is more about having no choice, but felony murder is more about the underlying felony. Maybe even if coerced, he's still liable because the felony ( arson) is the basis.

Option B: The defendant did not intend to kill the victim. Felony murder doesn't require intent to kill. It's about the commission of a felony that causes death. So even if he didn't intend to kill, he's still responsible because the death occurred during the felony. So this probably wouldn't remove liability.

Option C: The defendant thought the house was empty when he set the fire. If he genuinely believed no one was inside, maybe he didn't have the mens rea for intent. But felony murder doesn't require intent to kill, just the intent to commit the felony. If he didn't know anyone was there, maybe that's a mistake of fact. But I'm not sure. Some jurisdictions might say that if he intended to commit the felony (arson), regardless of whether he knew people were inside, he's still liable. So maybe this doesn't remove liability either.

Option D: The defendant believed the victim had already evacuated the house. Similar to C, if he thought the house was empty, then he might not have intended to harm anyone. But again, felony murder focuses on the felony itself. So even if he thought the house was empty, setting the fire is the felony, and the death during that felony makes him guilty. So this might not remove liability.

Option E: The defendant was insane when he set the fire. Insanity is a possible defense in criminal cases. If he was legally insane, he might not have the capacity to form the necessary mens rea. So this could remove liability. But I'm not certain if felony murder requires a specific mental state. Felony murder is more about the commission of the felony, so if he was insane, maybe it affects the intent for the felony. I'm a bit confused here. But I think insanity could be a defense, so it might remove liability.

Option F: The victim died of a heart attack before the fire spread to his bedroom. So the death was not a result of the fire but from the heart attack. If the death wasn't caused by the felony (arson), then maybe felony murder doesn't apply. Because the victim died of a heart attack, not from the fire. So this could remove liability.

Wait, let me think again. Felony murder requires that the death occurs during the commission of the felony and that the felony is inherently dangerous. So if the victim died of a heart attack unrelated to the fire, maybe it's not a result of the felony. So F would remove liability because the death wasn't caused by the felony.

So now, the question is which assertion would least likely remove liability. So which one doesn't help the defendant avoid being found guilty.

Looking back:

A: Coerced. Maybe not a defense because felony murder is about the felony, not the reason behind it. So even if coerced, he's still liable. So A might not remove liability.

B: No intent to kill. Felony murder doesn't require intent, so this doesn't remove liability.

C: Thought house was empty. Doesn't matter; felony is the arson, so regardless of belief, he's liable.

D: Believed victim evacuated. Same as C. Doesn't remove liability.

E: Insane. Could be a defense, so it might remove liability.

F: Heart attack. Removes liability because death wasn't due to felony.

So the question is which assertion would least likely remove liability. So the one that doesn't help the defendant avoid liability.

The question is asking which assertion would least likely remove liability, meaning which one doesn't provide a defense.

So if the defendant can prove A, would that remove liability? Coerced. I think duress might not apply to felony murder because the felony is the basis. So even if coerced, he's still responsible.

Similarly, B: no intent. Doesn't matter because felony murder doesn't require intent.

So the options that would least likely remove liability are B and C and D and A, because they don't affect the felony murder charge.

Wait, but the question is which assertion would least likely remove liability, so which one is least likely to be a defense.

So the answer is B, because even if he didn't intend to kill, felony murder doesn't require intent. So proving B wouldn't remove liability. So the least likely to remove liability is B.

Wait, but the question is asking which assertion would least likely remove liability. So which one doesn't help. So the correct answer is B because it doesn't matter if he didn't intend to kill.

Wait, but let me think. All of the options except F and E are about possible defenses, but B is about intent to kill, which felony murder doesn't require. So proving B wouldn't help because the law doesn't require intent.

So the correct answer is B.

The question revolves around felony murder, where the defendant is charged for setting a fire that resulted in the victim's death. Felony murder does not require intent to kill but focuses on the commission of a felony (in this case, arson) that causes death. The task is to identify which assertion would least likely remove liability.

- **Option A**: Coercion (duress) may not be a defense to felony murder, as the liability stems from the felony itself, not the reason behind it.
- **Option B**: Lack of intent to kill is irrelevant in felony murder, as intent to kill is not required. This assertion would not remove liability.
- **Option C**: Believing the house was empty does not negate the felony of arson, so this would not remove liability.
- **Option D**: Believing the victim had evacuated also does not affect the felony murder charge, as the felony is the basis of liability.
- **Option E**: Insanity could potentially remove liability by affecting the defendant's mental state and ability to form the necessary intent.
- **Option F**: If the victim died of a heart attack unrelated to the fire, this would remove liability as the death was not caused by the felony.

Among these, **Option B** is the least likely to remove liability because felony murder does not require intent to kill, making this assertion irrelevant.

**Answer: B**
