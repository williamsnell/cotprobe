Okay, so I need to figure out how many minutes Sanjay watched TV last weekend. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, Sanjay watched 3 television shows, each 30 minutes long. So, I should calculate the total time for these shows. Since each show is 30 minutes, I can multiply 3 by 30. Let me do that: 3 times 30 is 90. So, the three shows add up to 90 minutes.

Next, he also watched a movie that was 90 minutes long. That's straightforward; the movie is 90 minutes on its own.

Now, to find the total time he spent watching TV, I need to add the time from the shows and the movie together. So, the shows are 90 minutes, and the movie is another 90 minutes. Adding those together: 90 plus 90 equals 180 minutes.

Wait, but let me double-check that. Three shows at 30 minutes each: 30 + 30 + 30 is indeed 90. Plus the movie, which is 90. So 90 plus 90 is 180. That seems right.

Looking at the options, D is 180. So, the answer should be D.

The total time Sanjay watched TV is the sum of the time spent on the shows and the movie. 

3 shows Ã— 30 minutes = 90 minutes  
Movie = 90 minutes  

Total = 90 + 90 = 180 minutes  

Answer: D
