Okay, so I need to figure out which option correctly fills in the blank in the given question. The question is about what philosopher Thomas Pogge argues regarding the duties of people in wealthy countries towards the global poor. The sentence says, "Since we who live in wealthy countries have directly caused harm, Pogge argues that we have very stringent ______ towards the global poor."

First, I should recall who Thomas Pogge is and his main arguments. From what I remember, Pogge is a philosopher known for his work on global justice and poverty. He argues that wealthy nations have significant responsibilities towards the global poor because their actions, policies, and structures have contributed to global inequality and poverty.

The question is about the type of duties these wealthy countries have. The options are various terms ending with "duties towards the global poor." I need to determine which term fits best with Pogge's arguments.

Let me go through the options one by one:

A: Libertarian duties - Libertarianism generally emphasizes individual freedoms and minimal state intervention. I don't think Pogge's argument is about libertarian duties, as his focus is more on state and institutional responsibilities rather than individual freedoms.

B: Positive duties - Positive duties refer to the obligation to actively do something to help others. Pogge does argue that wealthy countries have obligations to assist the poor, which could involve positive actions. This seems plausible.

C: Duty-free - This would mean no duties, which contradicts the premise that Pogge argues they have stringent duties. So C is unlikely.

D: Liberal duties - Liberalism can mean different things, but in this context, it might relate to duties based on liberal political philosophy. However, I'm not sure if Pogge uses "liberal duties" specifically.

E: Consequentialist duties - Consequentialism is about actions based on their outcomes. Pogge's arguments are more deontological, focusing on duties and justice rather than consequences alone, so E might not be right.

F: Conservative duties - Conservatism is about preserving existing institutions, which doesn't seem to align with Pogge's critical stance on global inequality.

G: Negative duties - Negative duties are about refraining from causing harm. While Pogge does talk about how wealthy countries cause harm, the question mentions "very stringent" duties, which implies more than just not causing harm; it might involve positive action.

H: Utilitarian duties - Utilitarianism is about the greatest good for the greatest number. Again, Pogge's approach isn't purely consequentialist, so H is probably not correct.

I: Human rights duties - Pogge does discuss human rights, but the question is about the nature of the duties rather than their basis. While related, this might not capture the specific term he uses.

J: Egalitarian duties - Egalitarianism focuses on equality. Pogge's work does emphasize equality and reducing global inequalities, so this is a strong contender.

Now, considering the options, both B (positive duties) and J (egalitarian duties) seem plausible. Pogge argues that wealthy countries have a duty to rectify global inequalities, which is a positive duty. He also promotes an egalitarian approach to global justice. So which term does he use more specifically?

Upon reflection, Pogge's argument emphasizes that wealthy nations have positive duties to assist the global poor because their policies have caused harm. He doesn't just argue for negative duties (like not harming) but for taking affirmative steps. Additionally, his work is often framed within an egalitarian perspective, aiming for a more just global order.

But the question is about the type of duty, not the basis. So "positive duties" (B) refers to the obligation to act, while "egalitarian duties" (J) refers to the principle of equality. Since the question is about the stringent duties, it's more about the nature of the duty itself, which is positive rather than negative or passive.

Wait, but in some contexts, Pogge's argument is framed under the idea of global justice, which is an egalitarian ideal. So maybe J is better. Alternatively, the term "positive duties" is more directly about the obligation to act.

Hmm, I might need to think about what Pogge specifically terms. In his work, he talks about "global justice" and the responsibilities of the Global North. He argues that these countries have positive duties to ensure that their policies do not harm and to help reduce global poverty.

So, positive duties would fit because they involve acting to help, rather than just refraining from harm. Therefore, the correct answer might be B: positive duties.

Wait, but I remember that Pogge's framework is often described as an egalitarian theory of global justice. So maybe J is the intended answer. But the question is about the type of duty, not the theory. So it's about whether it's positive or something else.

Alternatively, maybe "liberal" or "libertarian" is involved, but I don't think so. I think B is more accurate because it's about the obligation to act positively to remedy the harm caused.

The correct answer is B: positive duties towards the global poor.
