Okay, so I need to figure out who kills Tony in the movie West Side Story. I'm a bit rusty on the details, but I'll try to recall. From what I remember, the movie is a musical based on Romeo and Juliet, set in New York with two rival gangs: the Sharks and the Jets. The main characters are Tony from the Jets and Maria from the Sharks. They fall in love, but their families' feuds lead to tragedy.

I think the conflict between the gangs escalates, and there's a big fight scene. Tony is trying to prevent the violence. There's a moment where Tony is at the dance, and he's dancing with Maria, and then things take a dark turn. I remember a scene where Tony is shot. But who does the shooting?

Let me think about the characters. Chino is part of the Sharks, right? He's in love with Anita, and he's very loyal to the gang. There's a scene where Chino is upset because he thinks Maria is involved with Tony, and he might have done something because of that. Oh, wait, I think Chino is the one who gets a gun and goes to the dance where Tony is. So maybe Chino is the one who shoots Tony.

Wait, but wasn't there a part where Tony was trying to stop the fight, and someone shot him? I think it's Chino who does it. He might have been angry that Maria was dancing with Tony, thinking she was disloyal, so he takes it out on Tony. Alternatively, could it be someone else like Bernardo? But Bernardo is the leader of the Sharks, and I think he's more focused on the gang's fight with the Jets, not necessarily targeting Tony personally.

Another thought: Maybe it's not a Shark but a Jet? No, because the Jets are on Tony's side, and he's trying to stop the violence. So it's more likely someone from the Sharks. Chino is a key figure there. Also, in the musical, I recall that Chino is the one who gets the gun and is determined to use it against the Jets. So during the dance scene, when things get heated, Chino pulls out a gun and shoots Tony, mistaking him for someone else or just because he's angry about Maria.

So putting it all together, I think the answer is Chino, which is option C.

The character who kills Tony at the end of 'West Side Story' is Chino, a member of the Sharks. He shoots Tony during a confrontation at the dance, driven by anger and a misunderstanding regarding Maria's involvement with Tony.

Answer: C
