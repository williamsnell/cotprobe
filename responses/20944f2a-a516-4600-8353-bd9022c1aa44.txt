Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here about finding the pressure inside a boiler. Hmm, let's see. The question says the boiler contains liquid water and steam at 225°F. I remember that when a mixture of liquid and vapor exists, it's called a saturated mixture. In such cases, the temperature and pressure are the same throughout the mixture.

Wait, but the given enthalpy of vaporization is at 212°F, which is the boiling point of water at 1 atm. So at 212°F, the vaporization enthalpy is 970.3 Btu/lbm. But our problem is at 225°F, which is higher. I think I need to find the pressure corresponding to 225°F for water. Because in the saturated state, the temperature and pressure are related.

I remember that for water, the saturation temperature increases with pressure. So, at 225°F, the pressure must be higher than 1 atm. I should probably use the steam tables for this. Oh wait, but the problem doesn't provide steam tables. Maybe I can use the ideal gas law or some approximation?

Wait, but wait. The problem gives the specific volumes for vapor and liquid. The specific volume of vapor is 26.80 ft³/lbm, and liquid is 0.01672 ft³/lbm. Wait, but at 212°F, right? Because the enthalpy of vaporization is given at 212°F. So maybe I can use these specific volumes to find the pressure at 225°F.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the quality of the steam (x) is involved. The quality is the ratio of vapor to the total mass. The total specific volume v_total is given by v = v_f + x(v_g - v_f). But wait, in this problem, I don't know the quality. Hmm. Or do I? The problem doesn't specify the amount of liquid or vapor, so maybe it's a saturated mixture at a certain pressure, which would correspond to 225°F.

Wait, perhaps I should find the saturation pressure at 225°F. Let me think. If I can find the pressure where water boils at 225°F, that would be the pressure inside the boiler. So I need to find P where T_sat = 225°F.

From my knowledge, I think the saturation pressure increases as temperature increases. For example, at 100°C (which is 212°F), the pressure is 1 atm. So at 225°F, which is about 107°C, the saturation pressure must be higher. I'm not exactly sure, but maybe around 15-20 psia.

Wait, the options are from about 12.75 to 21.65 psia. So I need to pinpoint it. How can I calculate this without steam tables? Maybe using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation? But that's for the slope of the saturation curve, not the exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the given data. The problem provides the specific volumes at 212°F. Wait, maybe the process is different. Let me think.

The problem states that the boiler contains liquid and steam at 225°F. So it's a saturated mixture at 225°F. Therefore, the pressure must be the saturation pressure at 225°F. So I need to find P such that the saturation temperature is 225°F.

I think the saturation pressure at 225°F is approximately 15.8 psia. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me try to recall some key points from steam tables.

At 212°F (1 atm), the saturation pressure is 14.69 psi (which is about 1 atm). At higher temperatures, the pressure increases. For example, at 250°F, the saturation pressure is around 22.9 psi. Hmm, so 225°F is between 212 and 250. Let's see, maybe around 16-17 psi.

Wait, perhaps I can interpolate. Let me think. Let's say at 212°F, pressure is 14.7 psi. At 250°F, it's 22.9 psi. The temperature difference between 212 and 250 is 38°F. We're looking at 225°F, which is 13°F above 212. So 13/38 is about 0.342. So the pressure increase would be 0.342*(22.9 -14.7) = 0.342*(8.2) ≈ 2.8 psi. So 14.7 + 2.8 ≈ 17.5 psi. Hmm, but that's rough.

Wait, but wait, the options include B:17.30 and H:18.45. Hmm. Maybe my interpolation is off. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate using the given specific volumes.

Wait, the problem gives v_f and v_g at 212°F as 0.01672 and 26.80 ft³/lbm, respectively. But the temperature is 225°F, so perhaps I can't directly use those specific volumes. Unless the problem is implying that the quality is such that the specific volume is the same as at 212°F, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the way to approach this is to consider that the mixture is at 225°F, so the pressure is the saturation pressure at that temperature. Therefore, the pressure is the saturation pressure at 225°F.

I think I need to look up the saturation pressure for 225°F. From memory, I think it's around 17.5 psi. Looking at the options, B is 17.30 and H is 18.45. So maybe B is the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate it using the ideal gas law for the vapor, considering the specific volume and the enthalpy of vaporization.

Wait, the enthalpy of vaporization at 212°F is 970.3 Btu/lbm. But the temperature is higher, so perhaps the enthalpy increases with temperature. But I'm not sure how to apply that here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the ideal gas equation for the vapor. The specific volume of vapor at 225°F and pressure P is v_g = RT/(PM), where R is the gas constant, T is in absolute temperature, P is in psia, and M is the molecular weight of water (18.015 lbm/lbmol).

Wait, R for water vapor is 97.046 ft³·psia/(lbmol·°R). So let's compute.

First, convert 225°F to °R: 225 + 459.67 = 684.67 °R.

The specific volume v_g is given at 212°F, but perhaps that's a red herring. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have us use the specific volume and pressure to find something else.

Wait, but I'm not given the specific volume at 225°F. So maybe that approach won't work.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is implying that the specific volume is the same as at 212°F, but that can't be right because temperature affects specific volume.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since the mixture is at 225°F, the pressure is the saturation pressure at that temperature. So I need to find P where the saturation temperature is 225°F.

Looking up in my mind, I think the saturation pressure at 225°F is approximately 17.3 psi. So the correct answer would be option B: 17.30 psia.

The pressure inside the boiler is determined by the saturation pressure corresponding to the given temperature of 225°F. In a saturated mixture of liquid and steam, the pressure and temperature are directly related. At 212°F, the saturation pressure is 1 atm (approximately 14.7 psia), and it increases with temperature. By extrapolating or interpolating from known saturation pressures, the pressure at 225°F is approximately 17.30 psia.
