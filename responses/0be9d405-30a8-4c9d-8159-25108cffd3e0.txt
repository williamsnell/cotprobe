Okay, so I have this series to analyze: the sum from n=0 to infinity of n! divided by (n squared times cosine n). The question is whether this series converges, and I have several options to choose from, like converges absolutely, diverges, converges conditionally, etc.

First, I should recall some tests for convergence. The series is Σ(n! / (n² cos(n)) ) from n=0 to ∞. Wait, but wait, when n=0, n! is 0! which is 1, and cos(0) is 1, so the first term is 1/(0² * 1). Oh wait, 0² is zero, so the first term would be undefined. Hmm, maybe the series starts from n=1? Or perhaps the question has a typo. But assuming it's from n=0, maybe the first term is 1/(0 *1), which is undefined. So perhaps the series starts from n=1. Alternatively, maybe the problem statement is correct, but in that case, the first term is undefined, which complicates things. But perhaps I can proceed assuming it starts from n=1.

Wait, no, maybe the problem is correct, but the index starts at n=0. However, when n=0, cos(0)=1, so the term would be 0!/(0² * 1) = 1/(0) which is undefined. So maybe the series starts at n=1. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is correct, and perhaps it's a typo, but I'll proceed assuming n starts at 1.

So the series is Σ(n! / (n² cos(n)) ) from n=1 to ∞. Now, I should think about whether this series converges or diverges.

First, let's look at the general term: a_n = n! / (n² cos(n)).

I know that cos(n) oscillates between -1 and 1 for integer n. So cos(n) can be positive or negative, but its absolute value is always ≤1. So |cos(n)| ≤1. So the denominator is n² cos(n), which can be as small as -n² or as large as n², but because cos(n) can be zero, the term can become undefined if cos(n)=0, but for integer n, cos(n) is never exactly zero because cos(kπ) would be zero, but n is an integer, so k would have to be such that n = π k, but π is irrational, so n can't be a multiple of π. So cos(n) never equals zero for integer n, so the terms are defined for all n.

But since cos(n) can be positive or negative, the terms a_n can alternate in sign, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Wait, but cos(n) isn't necessarily alternating; it's not like (-1)^n. For example, cos(0)=1, cos(1)≈0.54, cos(2)≈-0.416, cos(3)≈-0.989, cos(4)≈-0.653, cos(5)≈0.283, etc. So the sign does change, but not in a regular alternating pattern. So the series isn't necessarily alternating in a predictable way.

So first, I should check for absolute convergence. If the series converges absolutely, then it converges. So let's consider the absolute value of the general term: |a_n| = |n!| / |n² cos(n)|. Since |cos(n)| ≤1, this is ≥ n! / (n² *1) = n! /n².

Now, n! grows very rapidly. For example, n! is about n^n times some factor. So n! /n² would be roughly n^(n-2). Which for n≥3, the terms are growing exponentially. So the absolute series Σ |a_n| = Σ (n! / (n² |cos(n)|)) ≥ Σ (n! /n²) because |cos(n)| ≤1.

But Σ (n! /n²) from n=1 to ∞, does this converge? Let's see. As n increases, n! grows much faster than any polynomial, so n! /n² increases without bound. So the terms of the absolute series are growing without bound, which means that the series Σ |a_n| diverges, because the necessary condition for convergence (that the terms go to zero) isn't met. Wait, but wait: for the series to converge, the terms must approach zero. So if |a_n| approaches infinity, then the series can't converge.

Wait, in our case, |a_n| = n!/(n² |cos(n)|). Since |cos(n)| ≤1, |a_n| ≥ n!/(n²). Now, n! grows faster than any exponential function, so n! /n² grows without bound as n approaches infinity. Therefore, |a_n| tends to infinity. Therefore, the necessary condition for convergence of the series Σ a_n is that a_n approaches zero, but since |a_n| approaches infinity, the series cannot converge. Hence, the series diverges.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. Because sometimes even if the terms don't approach zero, the series can diverge. But I think the first thing to check is whether a_n approaches zero. If a_n doesn't approach zero, the series must diverge. So in our case, a_n is n!/(n² cos(n)). Since the absolute value of a_n is at least n!/(n²), which grows to infinity, a_n itself must tend to infinity or negative infinity, depending on the sign of cos(n). So a_n doesn't approach zero; in fact, it tends to ±infinity. Therefore, the series cannot converge because the necessary condition (that a_n approaches zero) isn't met.

So the series diverges. Now, looking at the options, option D is "Diverges", and option I is "Diverges to infinity". So which one is correct?

Well, the terms of the series are growing in magnitude and oscillating in sign because cos(n) alternates in sign. So the partial sums would be oscillating and growing without bound, but the series doesn't approach any finite limit. So the series diverges, but it's not because it approaches a specific infinity, but rather because the terms themselves don't approach zero, leading the series to not settle down to any limit.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: Diverges.

The series $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{n!}{n^2 \cos(n)}$ is examined for convergence. The general term is $a_n = \frac{n!}{n^2 \cos(n)}$. Since $|\cos(n)| \leq 1$, the absolute value of the terms satisfies $|a_n| \geq \frac{n!}{n^2}$. As $n!$ grows much faster than any polynomial, $|a_n|$ tends to infinity. Since the necessary condition for convergence (terms approaching zero) is violated, the series diverges.

Answer: D
