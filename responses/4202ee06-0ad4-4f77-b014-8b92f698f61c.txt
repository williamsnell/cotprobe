Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about Newton's rings. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. 

The question says that Newton's rings are seen in transmitted light with a wavelength of 500 nm. The diameter of the 20th bright ring is 4 mm. Part a asks for the radius of curvature of the lens, and part b asks for the diameter of the 30th bright ring. There are multiple-choice options from A to J, so I need to find which one is correct.

First, I remember that Newton's rings are formed due to the interference of light waves reflected from the top and bottom surfaces of a thin air wedge between a plano-convex lens and a glass plate. The dark and bright rings are due to constructive and destructive interference, respectively.

The formula for the radius (r) of the m-th bright ring in Newton's rings is given by:

r = sqrt( (m * λ * R) )

Wait, no, maybe I should think again. Oh right, the condition for constructive interference (bright rings) is 2t = (m + 1/2)λ, where t is the thickness of the air wedge. But wait, actually, when you have transmitted light, the condition might be different. Oh right, for transmitted light, it's 2t = mλ because both reflections (from top and bottom surfaces) don't have a phase shift. Wait, no, wait. When light reflects off a medium with higher refractive index, it undergoes a phase shift of π (equivalent to half a wavelength). So, for the plano-convex lens, the first reflection is from the glass to air, which is a higher index, so it gets a phase shift. The second reflection is from air to glass again, so another phase shift. So the total phase shift between the two reflected beams is 2*(π/2) = π. But in transmitted light, we're considering the light that goes through the lens, so maybe the path difference is different.

Wait, perhaps I should get the formula right. The standard formula for the radius of the m-th bright ring in transmitted light is:

r_m = sqrt( m λ R )

Wait, no, let me think again. The thickness t of the air wedge at a distance r from the center is approximately t = r^2 / (2R), assuming R is the radius of curvature of the lens, which is much larger than r. 

For transmitted light, the condition for constructive interference (bright ring) is 2t = m λ. Because when light goes from air to glass, there's a phase shift of λ/2 (equivalent to a phase change of π), but since both the top and bottom surfaces contribute to the transmitted beam, the two reflected waves would have a phase difference that depends on the path difference. Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me recall: the condition for bright rings in transmitted light is when the path difference is an integer multiple of the wavelength. Since the light travels down and up, the path difference is 2t. So, 2t = m λ. 

So substituting t = r^2/(2R), we get:

2*(r²/(2R)) = m λ → r² = m λ R → r = sqrt(m λ R )

Wait, so that's the formula I should use.

Given that, the m-th bright ring's radius is r_m = sqrt( m λ R )

Wait, but wait, for the first bright ring (m=1), r1 would be sqrt( λ R ), and so on.

In this problem, the diameter of the 20th bright ring is 4 mm, which means the radius is 2 mm, or 0.002 meters.

So for m=20:

r_20 = sqrt(20 * λ * R )

We have r_20 = 0.002 m, λ = 500 nm = 500e-9 m.

Plugging in the numbers:

0.002 = sqrt( 20 * 500e-9 * R )

Let me square both sides:

(0.002)^2 = 20 * 500e-9 * R

0.000004 = 20 * 500e-9 * R

Calculating the right side: 20 * 500e-9 = 1e-5 * 1e-3? Wait, 20 * 500 is 10,000, so 10,000e-9 = 1e-5.

Wait, no, 20 * 500e-9 = (20 * 500) * 1e-9 = 10,000 * 1e-9 = 1e-5 meters.

So 0.000004 = 1e-5 * R → R = 0.000004 / 1e-5 = 0.4 m → 40 cm.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see an option with R=40 cm. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: 50 cm

B: 35 cm

C:39 cm

D:48 cm

E:35

F:45

G:39

H:45

I:30

J:42

Hmm, I got R=40 cm, but none of the options have exactly 40. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe I messed up the condition for constructive interference. Let me double-check. In some references, the formula for the radius of the m-th bright ring in Newton's rings when using transmitted light is:

r_m = sqrt( (2m -1) λ R )

Wait, no, that's for dark rings perhaps. Wait, no, for dark rings, the condition is 2t = (m + 1/2) λ. So for bright rings in transmitted light, it's 2t = m λ.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. The correct formula for the radius of the m-th bright ring in transmitted light is r_m = sqrt( m λ R ), as I thought earlier. But wait, maybe it's (m-0.5)λ? Or perhaps I got the phase shifts wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should rederive it. Let's consider the path difference for the two reflected beams in transmitted light. When light reflects off the top surface of the lens (glass to air), it undergoes a phase shift of λ/2. When it reflects off the glass plate (air to glass), it also undergoes a phase shift of λ/2. So the total phase shift due to reflections is λ/2 + λ/2 = λ. So the path difference due to the air wedge is 2t, and the condition for constructive interference (bright ring) is that the total phase difference is an integer multiple of 2π. So the condition would be:

2t = (m) λ → because the phase shift from reflections is λ, which is equivalent to a path difference of λ. So the total path difference is 2t + λ = m λ → 2t = (m-1) λ.

Wait, no, that might be where I went wrong. Let me think carefully. When you have two reflections, each causing a phase shift of λ/2, the total phase shift is λ. So the condition for constructive interference (bright) is that the path difference plus the phase shift equals an integer multiple of λ. So 2t + λ = m λ → 2t = (m-1) λ.

Wait, but that would give 2t = (m-1)λ → t = (m-1)λ/2.

But earlier I thought the condition was 2t = m λ. Now I'm getting 2t = (m-1)λ. So which one is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for bright rings in transmitted light is:

r_m = sqrt( (2m - 1) λ R )

Wait, no, that seems like the dark rings' condition. Because dark rings occur when 2t = (m + 1/2) λ, which would give for dark rings:

r^2 = (2m +1) λ R / 2 → r = sqrt( (2m+1) λ R / 2 )

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me look for another approach. Maybe I can refer to standard formulas.

Upon checking, the correct formula for the radius of the m-th bright ring in Newton's rings (transmitted light) is:

r_m = sqrt( m λ R )

But if the phase shifts are considered, when using transmitted light, the condition is 2t = m λ, because both reflections cause phase shifts that add up to a full wavelength (λ), so the path difference needed for constructive interference is 2t = m λ. So yes, my initial formula was correct.

So back to the calculation:

r_20 = sqrt(20 * λ * R ) = 0.002 m.

So:

(0.002)^2 = 20 * 500e-9 * R → 0.000004 = 20 * 500e-9 * R.

20 * 500e-9 = 1e-5 → 1e-5 R = 0.000004 → R = 0.000004 / 1e-5 = 0.4 m → 40 cm.

Hmm, but the options don't have 40 cm. The closest are C:39 cm and J:42 cm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the formula is r_m = sqrt( (m) λ R ), but perhaps the correct condition is 2t = (m + 0.5) λ, which would be for dark rings. Wait, no, that can't be right because the problem refers to bright rings.

Wait, another approach. Maybe I should consider that the first bright ring is at m=1, so r_1 = sqrt( λ R ). Let's plug in m=1 and see.

If R=39 cm, as in option C, then r_1 = sqrt(1 * 500e-9 * 0.39 ) → sqrt(500e-9 * 0.39 ) → sqrt(1.95e-7) → approx 1.396e-3 m → 1.396 mm.

Similarly, for m=20, r_20 = sqrt(20 * 500e-9 * 0.39) → sqrt(20 * 1.95e-7 ) → sqrt(3.9e-6) → approx 0.001975 m → 1.975 mm → diameter 3.95 mm. But the problem states that the 20th bright ring has a diameter of 4 mm, which is close to 3.95 mm. So perhaps option C is correct.

Wait, but I calculated R as 40 cm, but option C is 39 cm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's redo the calculation with the correct formula.

r_20 = sqrt(20 * 500e-9 m * R )

Given r_20 = 2 mm = 0.002 m.

So:

(0.002)^2 = 20 * 500e-9 * R

0.000004 = 20 * 500e-9 * R

20 * 500e-9 = 10,000e-9 = 1e-5 m.

So 0.000004 = 1e-5 * R → R = 0.000004 / 1e-5 = 0.4 m → 40 cm.

But none of the options have 40 cm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is r_m = sqrt( (m + 0.5) λ R ), but that would be for dark rings.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for bright rings is r_m = sqrt( (2m -1) λ R ), but that would give for m=20, r_20 = sqrt(39 * 500e-9 * R ). Let's try that.

If R=39 cm, then:

r_20 = sqrt(39 * 500e-9 * 0.39 )

Calculate inside the square root:

39 * 500e-9 = 19.5e-6

19.5e-6 * 0.39 ≈ 7.605e-6

sqrt(7.605e-6) ≈ 0.002758 m → 2.758 mm → diameter 5.516 mm. But the problem says the diameter is 4 mm, so this doesn't fit.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for dark rings, which is r_m = sqrt( (m) λ R ), but that doesn't make sense because dark rings occur at (2m+1) λ/2 path difference.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the options again. Option C states R=39 cm, and part b) asks for the diameter of the 30th bright ring.

If R=39 cm, then for m=30, r_30 = sqrt(30 * 500e-9 * 0.39 )

30 * 500e-9 = 1.5e-5 m

1.5e-5 * 0.39 = 5.85e-6 m

sqrt(5.85e-6) ≈ 0.002419 m → 2.419 mm → diameter ≈4.838 mm. But the options say for C, the 30th ring is 5.5 mm. That's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should try option J: R=42 cm.

For m=20, r_20 = sqrt(20 * 500e-9 * 0.42 )

20 *500e-9=1e-5 m

1e-5 *0.42 =4.2e-6

sqrt(4.2e-6)= approx 0.002049 m → 2.049 mm → diameter 4.098 mm, which is close to 4 mm. So R=42 cm would give diameter for m=20 as ~4.1 mm, which is close to the given 4 mm.

Then for part b), m=30:

r_30 = sqrt(30 *500e-9 *0.42 )

30 *500e-9=1.5e-5 m

1.5e-5 *0.42=6.3e-6 m

sqrt(6.3e-6)= approx 0.00251 m → 2.51 mm → diameter 5.02 mm. Looking at option J, the 30th ring is 5.0 mm, which matches closely.

So option J says R=42 cm and 30th ring diameter 5.0 mm. But earlier calculation with R=42 cm gives r_20=4.1 mm, which is close to 4 mm, perhaps within experimental error.

But wait, the calculation I did earlier with R=40 cm gives r_20=2 mm, which is exactly the given diameter of 4 mm (since diameter is twice the radius). So perhaps the correct R is 40 cm, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is r_m = sqrt( (m) * (λ/2) * R ), but that would complicate things.

Wait another approach: perhaps the formula is r_m = sqrt( m λ R ), but let's check with R=48 cm, option D.

r_20 = sqrt(20 *500e-9 *0.48 )

20 *500e-9=1e-5 m

1e-5 *0.48=4.8e-6 m

sqrt(4.8e-6)= ~0.00219 m → 2.19 mm → diameter ~4.38 mm, which is a bit larger than 4 mm. Not matching.

Another option, option H: R=45 cm.

r_20 = sqrt(20 *500e-9 *0.45 )

20 *500e-9=1e-5 m

1e-5 *0.45=4.5e-6 m

sqrt(4.5e-6)= ~0.002121 m → 2.121 mm → diameter 4.242 mm. Closer to 4.24 mm, but the given is 4 mm. Hmm.

Option C: R=39 cm.

r_20= sqrt(20 *500e-9 *0.39 )= sqrt( 20 * 1.95e-7 )= sqrt(3.9e-6)= ~0.001975 m → 1.975 mm → diameter 3.95 mm. Hmm, that's a bit less than 4 mm.

Wait, maybe the formula uses the radius in meters correctly. Let me recheck the calculation with R=40 cm.

r_20 = sqrt(20 *500e-9 *0.4 )= sqrt(20 * 2e-7 )= sqrt(4e-6)= 0.002 m → 2 mm → diameter 4 mm. Perfect. So R=40 cm is correct. But none of the options have R=40 cm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe the formula is r_m = sqrt( (m) * λ * R / 2 )

Because sometimes the formula is written as r^2 = (m λ R ) / 2.

Wait, let me think again. The condition for constructive interference is 2t = m λ, and t = r²/(2R). So 2*(r²/(2R)) )= m λ → r²/R = m λ → r = sqrt( m λ R )

Yes, that's correct. So if R=40 cm, r_20=2 mm.

But since none of the options have R=40 cm, perhaps the correct option is not present, which is unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me check the options again.

Wait, option J says R=42 cm, diameter of 30th ring 5.0 mm.

If R=42 cm, then:

r_20 = sqrt(20 *500e-9 *0.42 )= sqrt( 20 * 500e-9 * 0.42 )

20 *500e-9 = 1e-5 m

1e-5 *0.42 =4.2e-6 m

sqrt(4.2e-6)= approx 0.002049 m → 2.049 mm → diameter 4.098 mm, which is about 4.1 mm. Close to 4 mm. Maybe it's within the acceptable range.

Then for m=30,

r_30 = sqrt(30 *500e-9 *0.42 )= sqrt(30 * 2.1e-7 )= sqrt(6.3e-6 )= approx 0.00251 m → 2.51 mm → diameter 5.02 mm, which matches option J's 5.0 mm.

So perhaps option J is correct, with R=42 cm and 30th ring diameter 5.0 mm.

But earlier calculation with R=40 cm gives exactly the 4 mm diameter for m=20, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option J.

Wait, but another option: option C has R=39 cm, and the 30th ring is 5.5 mm. Let's calculate that.

r_30 = sqrt(30 *500e-9 *0.39 )= sqrt(30 * 1.95e-7 )= sqrt(5.85e-6 )= ~0.002419 m → 2.419 mm → diameter 4.838 mm. That's not matching the 5.5 mm in option C. So maybe option C isn't correct.

Another option, option H: R=45 cm and 30th ring 5.2 mm.

r_30= sqrt(30 *500e-9 *0.45 )= sqrt(30 * 2.25e-7 )= sqrt(6.75e-6 )= ~0.002598 m → 2.598 mm → diameter 5.196 mm, which is close to 5.2 mm. So option H's 30th ring is 5.2 mm. But for m=20, R=45 cm gives r_20= sqrt(20 * 500e-9 * 0.45 )= sqrt(4.5e-6 )= ~0.002121 m → 2.121 mm → diameter 4.242 mm, which is a bit larger than 4 mm.

Hmm. So option J gives m=20 as ~4.098 mm, which is close to 4 mm, and m=30 as 5.02 mm, which is 5.0 mm as in option J.

But the correct R from the calculation is 40 cm, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option J, considering possible rounding.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. Maybe the formula for the diameter is twice the radius, so r is the radius, diameter is 2r.

Wait, yes, that's correct. So if the radius is 2 mm, the diameter is 4 mm, which matches the given condition.

So putting it all together, the correct R should be 40 cm, but since that's not an option, perhaps the closest option is J: 42 cm and 5.0 mm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C: R=39 cm and 5.5 mm for m=30.

Wait, let me calculate for R=39 cm, m=30:

r_30 = sqrt(30 *500e-9 *0.39 )= sqrt(30 *1.95e-7 )= sqrt(5.85e-6 )= ~0.002419 m → 2.419 mm → diameter 4.838 mm, which doesn't match option C's 5.5 mm.

Hmm, perhaps I should re-express the formula correctly. Wait, perhaps the formula is r_m = sqrt( (m) λ R ), but perhaps I should not forget that the radius is in meters, and the wavelength is in meters.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate with R=39 cm:

r_20 = sqrt(20 *500e-9 *0.39 )= sqrt(20 * 1.95e-7 )= sqrt(3.9e-6 )= ~0.0019748 m → 1.9748 mm → diameter 3.9496 mm, which is about 3.95 mm, but the given is 4 mm. So perhaps R=39 cm is acceptable, and then for m=30, the diameter would be:

r_30 = sqrt(30 *500e-9 *0.39 )= sqrt(30 *1.95e-7 )= sqrt(5.85e-6 )= ~0.002419 m → 2.419 mm → diameter 4.838 mm. But option C says 5.5 mm, which is higher. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the formula is r_m = sqrt( (m) * (λ/2) * R ), which would change the calculation.

Let me try that: r_m = sqrt( m * (λ/2) * R )

For m=20, R=39 cm:

r_20 = sqrt(20 * (500e-9/2) * 0.39 )= sqrt(20 *250e-9 *0.39 )= sqrt(20 * 9.75e-8 )= sqrt(1.95e-6 )= ~0.001396 m → 1.396 mm → diameter 2.792 mm. That's way off, so that can't be right.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think differently. Since none of the options have R=40 cm, perhaps the question intended the formula to be r_m = sqrt( (m) * (λ/2) * R ), which would change the result.

Wait, if I use that formula, then for m=20, r_20 = sqrt(20 * 500e-9/2 * R )

So:

r_20 = sqrt(20 *250e-9 * R )

Given r_20=0.002 m,

0.002^2 = 20 *250e-9 * R → 0.000004 = 5e-6 * R → R=0.000004 /5e-6 = 0.8 m → 80 cm. But that's not in the options either.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is r_m = sqrt( (m-1) * λ * R )

For m=20:

r_20 = sqrt(19 *500e-9 * R )=0.002 m → 0.002^2= 19 *500e-9 * R → 0.000004 = 9.5e-6 R → R= 0.000004 /9.5e-6 ≈ 0.421 m → ~42.1 cm, which is close to option J's 42 cm. Then for m=30,

r_30 = sqrt(29 *500e-9 *0.421 )= sqrt(29 * 2.105e-7 )= sqrt(6.1045e-6 )= ~0.00247 m → 2.47 mm → diameter 4.94 mm, which is close to option J's 5.0 mm. But option J says 5.0 mm, so perhaps that's the intended answer.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is r_m = sqrt( (m) * λ * R )

In that case, R=40 cm as calculated earlier, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option J.
</think>

To solve the problem, we use the formula for the radius of the m-th bright ring in Newton's rings for transmitted light:

\[
r_m = \sqrt{m \lambda R}
\]

### Step 1: Solve for the radius of curvature \( R \)
Given:
- Wavelength \( \lambda = 500 \, \text{nm} = 500 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \)
- Diameter of the 20th bright ring = \( 4 \, \text{mm} \), so radius \( r_{20} = 2 \, \text{mm} = 0.002 \, \text{m} \)
- \( m = 20 \)

Using the formula:
\[
r_{20}^2 = 20 \lambda R
\]
\[
(0.002)^2 = 20 \times 500 \times 10^{-9} \times R
\]
\[
0.000004 = 1 \times 10^{-5} \times R
\]
\[
R = \frac{0.000004}{1 \times 10^{-5}} = 0.4 \, \text{m} = 40 \, \text{cm}
\]

Thus, the calculated radius of curvature is \( R = 40 \, \text{cm} \). However, this value is not among the provided options, so we proceed to evaluate the options based on the given data.

### Step 2: Evaluate the options
#### Option J: \( R = 42 \, \text{cm} \), Diameter of the 30th ring = \( 5.0 \, \text{mm} \)
For \( m = 30 \):
\[
r_{30} = \sqrt{30 \times 500 \times 10^{-9} \times 0.42}
\]
\[
r_{30} = \sqrt{30 \times 2.1 \times 10^{-7}} = \sqrt{6.3 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 0.00251 \, \text{m} = 2.51 \, \text{mm}
\]
Diameter = \( 2 \times 2.51 \, \text{mm} = 5.02 \, \text{mm} \), which closely matches the given \( 5.0 \, \text{mm} \).

For \( m = 20 \):
\[
r_{20} = \sqrt{20 \times 500 \times 10^{-9} \times 0.42}
\]
\[
r_{20} = \sqrt{20 \times 2.1 \times 10^{-7}} = \sqrt{4.2 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 0.00205 \, \text{m} = 2.05 \, \text{mm}
\]
Diameter = \( 2 \times 2.05 \, \text{mm} = 4.1 \, \text{mm} \), which is close to the given \( 4 \, \text{mm} \).

#### Other Options:
- **Option C (\( R = 39 \, \text{cm} \))**: For \( m = 30 \), the calculated diameter is \( 4.84 \, \text{mm} \), which does not match the given \( 5.5 \, \text{mm} \).
- **Option H (\( R = 45 \, \text{cm} \))**: For \( m = 20 \), the calculated diameter is \( 4.24 \, \text{mm} \), which is larger than the given \( 4 \, \text{mm} \).

### Conclusion:
Option J provides the closest match to both the given diameter of the 20th bright ring and the calculated diameter of the 30th bright ring.

**Answer: J**
