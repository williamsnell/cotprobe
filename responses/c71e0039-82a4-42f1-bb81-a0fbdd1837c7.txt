Okay, so I have this question about Kubler-Ross and the initial reaction of a terminally ill patient. I remember that Kubler-Ross came up with the stages of grief, right? Let me think about what those stages are. I think it's denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Yeah, that sounds right.

The question is asking about the initial reaction when the patient is informed of their condition. So, first thing first, what's the first stage? I believe it's denial. Denial is a way for people to cope with the reality of their situation, maybe refusing to accept the diagnosis.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one represents denial. Let's go through each option.

Option A: “I hate everybody and everything!” That sounds more like anger, which is the second stage, not the first.

Option B: "Can we negotiate a deal, God?" Hmm, that seems like bargaining, which is the third stage. People often try to negotiate, like making deals with a higher power.

Option C: “If you help me, God, I’ll reform my life!” That also sounds like bargaining, similar to B. They're offering something in exchange for help.

Option D: “No. it’s not possible!” This feels like denial. The patient is directly refusing to accept the diagnosis, which is exactly what denial is.

Option E: “I give up: I'm powerless!” That might be part of depression, the fourth stage. When people feel hopeless and without control.

Option F: "I don't believe in terminal illnesses." This also sounds like denial. The patient is refusing to accept the reality of the situation, maybe because it's too overwhelming.

Option G: "I'm not scared, I'm ready." That seems like acceptance, the final stage. The patient has come to terms with their situation.

Option H: "I knew this was coming." Hmm, this could be a mix of acceptance or maybe denial if they're minimizing the impact. Not sure about this one.

Option I: "I'll fight this and win." That's more like the bargaining or maybe even the fight phase, which isn't one of the official stages but shows resistance.

Option J: "Why me? It's not fair!" This is definitely anger. The patient is expressing frustration and feeling victimized.

So, the initial reaction is denial. Both options D and F seem to fit. D is a direct refusal, and F is a refusal of the concept of terminal illnesses. Which one is more likely the initial reaction? I think D is more direct denial of the situation, like "No, it's not possible," whereas F might be a broader denial, perhaps more of a coping mechanism but still denial.

But I'm a bit confused because sometimes people might say, "I don't believe in terminal illnesses," as a way to deny the reality. But I think the more direct denial is "No, it's not possible." So I'm leaning towards D as the correct answer. Kubler-Ross's first stage is denial, so the patient would likely respond with something like "No, it's not possible."

According to Kubler-Ross, the initial reaction of a terminally ill patient upon being informed of their condition is typically denial. This is the first stage of grief, where the patient refuses to accept the reality of their diagnosis as a coping mechanism. Among the options provided, "No. it’s not possible!" (Option D) best represents this initial reaction of denial, as it directly expresses refusal to accept the diagnosis.

Answer: D
