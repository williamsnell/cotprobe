Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question says that a store has 8 fish tanks, and each tank has 40 liters of water. I need to find the total number of liters of water in all the tanks combined.

Hmm, alright, so each tank is 40 liters, and there are 8 tanks. That sounds like a multiplication problem. I think I just need to multiply the number of tanks by the amount of water each holds. So, 8 times 40 liters. Let me write that down to visualize it better: 8 × 40 L.

Wait, let me double-check. If one tank is 40 liters, two tanks would be 80, three would be 120, and so on. So, each additional tank adds another 40 liters. So, 8 tanks would be 8 times 40. That makes sense.

Now, doing the multiplication: 8 × 40. Let me break it down. 8 × 4 is 32, and since 40 is 4 tens, I add a zero at the end. So, 32 becomes 320. Wait, no, that's not right. Because 40 is 4 times 10, so 8 × 40 is 8 × 4 × 10. So, 8 × 4 is 32, and then 32 × 10 is 320. So, the total should be 320 liters.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes I get confused with zeros. So, 40 × 8: 40 times 8. Let's see, 40 × 8 is like 40 added 8 times. 40 +40 is 80, plus another 40 is 120, then 160, 200, 240, 280, 320. Yes, that's 8 times. So, 320 liters in total.

Looking back at the options, I see option I is 320. So, that should be the correct answer.

The total number of liters is calculated by multiplying the number of tanks (8) by the capacity of each tank (40 liters). 8 × 40 = 320 liters.
