Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the inverse Laplace transform of 1 divided by [s(s² +4)]. The question mentions using convolution, so I think I should approach this using the convolution theorem. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the Laplace transform of a product of two functions is the convolution of their individual transforms. So if I can express the given function as a product of simpler functions, I can use the inverse Laplace transforms of those simpler functions and then convolve them.

Looking at the denominator, s(s² +4), I can see that it can be split into two parts: 1/s and 1/(s² +4). So, the original function is [1/s] * [1/(s² +4)]. 

I know that the inverse Laplace transform of 1/s is 1, because L⁻¹{1/s} = 1. And the inverse Laplace transform of 1/(s² +4) is (1/2)sin(2t), because L⁻¹{1/(s² + a²)} = (1/a)sin(at). Here, a is 2, so that gives me (1/2)sin(2t).

Since the original function is the product of these two, their inverse Laplace transforms will be convolved. So the solution should be the convolution of 1 and (1/2)sin(2t). 

Wait, but convolution of 1 and something else. Let me recall the convolution formula. The convolution of f(t) and g(t) is the integral from 0 to t of f(τ)g(t - τ) dτ. So in this case, f(τ) is 1, and g(τ) is (1/2)sin(2τ). 

So substituting, the convolution would be the integral from 0 to t of 1 * (1/2)sin(2(t - τ)) dτ. Let me write that out: ∫₀ᵗ (1/2) sin[2(t - τ)] dτ.

Hmm, that looks a bit tricky. Let me simplify the integral. Let me make a substitution: let u = t - τ. Then when τ=0, u=t, and when τ=t, u=0. So the integral becomes ∫ from u=t to u=0 of (1/2) sin(2u) (-du), because dτ = -du. So flipping the limits, it becomes ∫ from 0 to t of (1/2) sin(2u) du.

That's easier. Now, integrating (1/2) sin(2u) with respect to u. The integral of sin(ax) is -(1/a) cos(ax) + C. So here, a is 2, so the integral becomes (1/2) * [ -(1/(2)) cos(2u) ] evaluated from 0 to t.

Multiplying through, (1/2) * (-1/2) [cos(2t) - cos(0)]. Cos(0) is 1. So that's (-1/4)[cos(2t) - 1] which simplifies to (1/4)(1 - cos(2t)).

Wait, but let me check the signs again. Wait, the integral becomes (1/2) * [ (-1/2)(cos(2u)) ] from 0 to t. So that's (1/2)(-1/2)[cos(2t) - cos(0)] = (-1/4)[cos(2t) - 1] = (1/4)(1 - cos(2t)).

So the inverse Laplace transform is (1/4)(1 - cos(2t)).

Looking at the options, option G is (1/4)(1 - cos2t), and option C is (1/4)(1 - cos2t) as well. Wait, no: looking again, option C is (1/4)(1 - cos2t), and option G is (1/4)(1 - cos2t) as well? Wait, no, let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: (1 / 2)(e^(2t) - 1)
B: (1 / 2)(1 + cos2t)
C: (1 / 4)(1 - cos2t)
D: (1 / 4)(sin(2t) - cos(2t))
E: (1 / 2)sin(2t)
F: e^(-2t) * sin(2t)
G: (1 / 4)(1 - cos2t)
H: t * sin(2t)
I: (1 / 4)(1 + cos2t)
J: sin(2t)

Wait, both C and G are (1/4)(1 - cos2t). That can't be right. Did I make a mistake in the options? Let me check the user input again.

Wait, the user wrote:

Options:

A: (1 / 2)(e^(2t) - 1)
B: (1 / 2)(1 + cos2t)
C: (1 / 4)(1 - cos2t)
D: (1 / 4)(sin(2t) - cos(2t))
E: (1 / 2)sin(2t)
F: e^(-2t) * sin(2t)
G: (1 / 4)(1 - cos2t)
H: t * sin(2t)
I: (1 / 4)(1 + cos2t)
J: sin(2t)

Wait, that's a mistake. Options C and G are the same. That must be a typo. Because in the problem statement, options C and G are both (1/4)(1 - cos2t). That can't be correct. Perhaps one was meant to be different. Let me check the original problem again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in copying. Let me recheck the user's input. The options are:

A: (1 / 2)(e^(2t) - 1)
B: (1 / 2)(1 + cos2t)
C: (1 / 4)(1 - cos2t)
D: (1 / 4)(sin(2t) - cos(2t))
E: (1 / 2)sin(2t)
F: e^(-2t) * sin(2t)
G: (1 / 4)(1 - cos2t)
H: t * sin(2t)
I: (1 / 4)(1 + cos2t)
J: sin(2t)

Hmm, perhaps it's an error, but in any case, according to my calculation, the correct answer is (1/4)(1 - cos2t), which is either option C or G. Since both are same, perhaps only one is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me think again. Another approach: partial fractions. Maybe I can decompose 1/[s(s² +4)] into partial fractions, which might make it easier.

Let me try that. Let's write 1/[s(s² +4)] = A/s + (Bs + C)/(s² +4). 

Multiply both sides by s(s² +4):

1 = A(s² +4) + (Bs + C)s

Expand: 1 = A s² + 4A + B s² + C s

Combine like terms:

1 = (A + B)s² + C s + 4A

Now, equate coefficients:

For s²: A + B = 0
For s: C = 0
Constant: 4A = 1 → A = 1/4

From A + B =0, B = -A = -1/4.

So the decomposition is:

(1/4)/s + (- (1/4)s + 0 )/(s² +4)

Wait, so that's (1/4)s⁻¹ + (-1/4)s/(s² +4).

So the inverse Laplace transform would be:

(1/4)L⁻¹{s⁻¹} + (-1/4)L⁻¹{s/(s² +4)}.

Which is (1/4)(1) + (-1/4)(cos2t), because L⁻¹{s/(s² + a²)} = cos(at).

So combining, (1/4) - (1/4)cos(2t) = (1/4)(1 - cos2t), which matches what I found earlier.

So the correct answer is (1/4)(1 - cos2t), which is option C or G. Wait, but in the options, both C and G are same. So perhaps I made a mistake in the options. Maybe the user made a typo, but according to the given options, the correct answer would be option C and G, but since they are same, perhaps the intended answer is G, but that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, another way: using differentiation. Sometimes, taking derivatives can help, but I think the convolution method and partial fractions both lead to the same result. So I'm confident the answer is (1/4)(1 - cos2t), which is either C or G. Since both are same, perhaps it's a typo, but the correct letter would be option C.

Wait, looking back, the options list:

C: (1 / 4)(1 - cos2t)

G: (1 / 4)(1 - cos2t)

Wait, so both are same. That's a problem. Perhaps the correct answer is either, but the options likely have a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the partial fractions approach.

Wait, let me check the partial fractions again. Let me re-express:

1/[s(s² +4)] = A/s + (Bs + C)/(s² +4)

Multiplying both sides by s(s² +4):

1 = A(s² +4) + (Bs + C)s

1 = A s² +4A + B s² + C s

So grouping terms:

1 = (A + B)s² + C s + 4A

So:

A + B = 0 (coefficient of s²)
C = 0 (coefficient of s)
4A = 1 (constant term)

So A = 1/4, B = -1/4, C=0.

So the decomposition is:

(1/4)/s + (-1/4 s)/(s² +4)

So the inverse Laplace transform is:

(1/4)(1) + (-1/4)(cos2t) = (1/4) - (1/4)cos2t = (1/4)(1 - cos2t), which confirms the earlier result.

So the answer is option C or G. But since both options are same, perhaps the correct option is C, assuming that G is a duplicate.

Wait, perhaps the intended correct option is G, but given that both are same, perhaps the correct answer is option G, but that's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps I should check the options again for any potential mistake.

Wait, looking back, the options as given: option C is (1/4)(1 - cos2t), option G is same. So perhaps it's a mistake, but the correct answer is (1/4)(1 - cos2t), so the correct letter is either C or G. But I think in the problem statement, perhaps option G is correct, so I'll go with that.

The inverse Laplace transform of \( \frac{1}{s(s^2 + 4)} \) is found using partial fractions and results in \( \frac{1}{4}(1 - \cos(2t)) \), which corresponds to options C and G. Assuming the intended correct option is G.
