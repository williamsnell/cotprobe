Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let me read through it again and break it down. The scenario involves a husband and wife who are unhappily married, with the husband being an alcoholic who physically abuses his wife when drunk. One night, after he beats her, she decides to kill him. She's experienced with firearms, so she plans to shoot him while he sleeps. Before acting on her plan, she takes out a $1 million life insurance policy on her husband, naming herself as the beneficiary. 

Then, they celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary and have a nice evening together. After that, the wife changes her mind, doesn't want to kill him anymore, confesses her plan to her husband, and begs forgiveness. The husband is upset, files for divorce, and tells the police about her plan. Now, the question is whether she should be found guilty if charged with attempted murder.

The options are from A to I, each giving a different reason. I need to determine which is the correct legal outcome here.

First, I should consider the elements of attempted murder. Attempt generally requires specific intent to commit the crime plus a substantial step towards its commission. So, did she take a substantial step towards killing her husband?

She got a life insurance policy on him, which is a classic step in murder plots because it provides a motive and means. However, after getting the policy, she celebrated her anniversary with her husband and then changed her mind. She didn't carry out the act; she confessed before doing anything else.

In some jurisdictions, the withdrawal from the attempt before taking a substantial step can be a defense. If she decided not to go through with it and withdrew in time, she might not be guilty of attempted murder. But if she took a substantial step, even if she later withdrew, she might still be liable.

But here, she didn't actually take any steps beyond getting the insurance. She didn't purchase the gun yet, didn't go to the location, etc. She was planning, but the key is whether she took a substantial step towards the commission of the crime.

Another point is that she confessed after deciding not to kill him. So, she may have withdrawn her intent. But does that withdrawal count? If she completely renounced her plan and took affirmative steps to prevent the crime, like confessing, that could negate the attempt.

Alternatively, some jurisdictions might consider the purchase of the insurance policy as a substantial step. So, if she took out the policy, that could be enough for an attempt charge, even if she later changed her mind.

But I'm a bit confused. So, the key here is whether she took a substantial step and whether her later change of heart and confession count as withdrawal in time.

In some places, you can withdraw from a conspiracy or an attempt if you do so before any overt act. But in this case, she might have only done the insurance, which is an overt act, but then she didn't proceed further. She didn't buy the gun, didn't set it up, etc. So maybe the insurance alone is not enough for a substantial step, or perhaps it is.

Wait, but the model penal code says that an attempt requires a specific intent and a substantial step that is strongly corroborative of the intent. So, getting insurance could be a significant step because it's a step that's closely related to the crimeâ€”providing a financial incentive and a way to cover the tracks.

But then she had a change of heart after celebrating the anniversary. She told her husband and the police were notified. So, she didn't proceed further. Did she take any steps beyond the insurance? She planned to shoot him while he slept, but she didn't actually do that.

So, she took out the insurance, which is a step, but then she withdrew. If withdrawal is possible, she might not be guilty. But if withdrawal isn't possible, or if the insurance is enough for a substantial step, she could be guilty.

I think the key is whether she took a substantial step towards the commission of the crime. The insurance policy is a step, but perhaps not enough on its own. Alternatively, some courts might consider it sufficient.

But I'm also considering the fact that she didn't actually commit the act. She was only in the planning stages. So, without more concrete steps, maybe she hasn't gone far enough to be guilty of attempted murder.

Wait, but she had a specific plan: she was going to shoot him while he slept. She had the means (firearms experience), she took out the insurance, and she had the intent. But she didn't act on it.

In some cases, even the planning can be enough if there's a substantial step. But I'm not sure if taking out insurance is that substantial.

Another angle: she intended to kill him, which is the mens rea, but without the actus reus, she can only be charged with attempt. But whether she committed the attempt depends on the steps she took.

If she took a substantial step, like purchasing the gun or the insurance, then she might be guilty. But if she only thought about it and took out insurance, maybe that's enough.

But let's look at the options. Option E says guilty because she intended to kill him. But intent alone isn't enough for attempt; you need intent plus a substantial step.

Option I says guilty because she planned the murder. Planning alone isn't enough unless it's coupled with a substantial step.

Option G says not guilty because she changed her mind before committing the act. That's about withdrawal. If she withdrew in time, she might not be guilty. But whether her withdrawal was effective depends on the law.

In some jurisdictions, if you withdraw before any substantial steps, you can avoid liability. But if she took a substantial step, like the insurance, and then withdrew, she might still be liable.

Alternatively, if she didn't take any substantial steps beyond the insurance, then perhaps her withdrawal before any further steps would mean she's not guilty.

I'm leaning towards the fact that she took out the insurance, which is a step towards the crime, but after that, she didn't proceed further. She had a change of heart, confessed, and didn't go through with it. So, perhaps she didn't take a substantial step beyond the insurance, which might not be enough for an attempt.

Wait, but under the felony murder rule, she might be liable for the insurance as part of the plan. But that's more about first-degree murder, not attempt.

Alternatively, the insurance is a step that indicates she was serious, but without more, maybe it's not enough.

I'm a bit stuck. Let me think of case law. For example, in some cases, taking out insurance on someone's life has been considered a substantial step towards murder. So, perhaps she is guilty of attempted murder because she took that step.

But then, she withdrew before doing anything else. So, if withdrawal is possible, she might not be guilty. But withdrawal requires more than just deciding not to do it; you have to take affirmative steps to prevent the crime.

In this case, she told her husband and confessed, which could be seen as affirmative steps to prevent the crime. So, perhaps her withdrawal was effective.

If that's the case, then she wouldn't be guilty of attempted murder because she withdrew before taking any further steps.

Looking at the options, option G says "not guilty because she changed her mind before committing the act." But that's a bit simplistic. The correct reason would be that she withdrew in time, which negates the attempt.

Alternatively, option H says not guilty because she didn't commit the murder, but that's about the completed crime, not the attempt.

Wait, the question is about attempted murder, so she's not guilty of murder because she didn't kill him. But the issue is whether she's guilty of attempt.

So, if she took a substantial step but then withdrew, she might not be guilty. Alternatively, if she didn't take a substantial step, she's not guilty.

I think the insurance policy might be considered a substantial step. So, she took that step with the intent to kill, which would make her guilty of attempt. But then she withdrew by confessing, which might negate the attempt.

But whether her withdrawal was effective depends on the law. If she took affirmative steps to prevent the crime after deciding to withdraw, she might not be guilty.

So, perhaps she is not guilty because she withdrew before taking any further steps. Therefore, the correct answer would be G: not guilty because she changed her mind before committing the act.

Wait, but I'm not sure if changing her mind is enough. She has to take affirmative steps. She did confess to her husband and the police were notified, which might count as withdrawal.

So, in that case, she might not be guilty of attempted murder because she withdrew effectively.

Therefore, the answer would be G.

The scenario involves a wife who planned to kill her abusive husband but changed her mind before acting. To determine her guilt for attempted murder, we analyze whether she took a substantial step toward the crime and whether her withdrawal was effective.

1. **Elements of Attempt**: Attempt requires specific intent to commit the crime and a substantial step toward its commission. The wife took out a life insurance policy, which could be considered a substantial step as it provides a financial motive and means for the crime.

2. **Withdrawal**: After deciding not to kill her husband, she confessed to her husband and notified the police. This constitutes affirmative steps to prevent the crime, which may negate the attempt if withdrawal was effective.

3. **Analysis of Options**: 
   - **Option G** correctly identifies that she changed her mind before committing the act, which, coupled with her confession, suggests an effective withdrawal.
   - Other options, such as **E** (intent) and **I** (planning), are insufficient because intent alone or planning without a substantial step do not constitute attempt.

Given her confession and withdrawal, she effectively prevented the crime, making her not guilty of attempted murder.

Answer: G
