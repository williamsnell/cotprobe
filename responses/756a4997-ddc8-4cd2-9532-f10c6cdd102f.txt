Okay, so I have this question about Ross's prima facie duties. I remember that W.D. Ross was a British philosopher who talked about prima facie duties in his ethical theory. Prima facie means "at first glance," so these are duties that seem to be duties, but they might not hold up when considering all the circumstances.

The question is asking about what Ross said regarding our prima facie duties. The options are A through I. Let me go through each option.

Option A: Are only applicable to certain cultures. I don't think Ross's duties are culture-specific. He was more into a universal approach, so probably not A.

Option B: Determined by societal norms. Ross's duties are based on principles like fidelity, reparation, gratitude, etc., which are more universal and not just societal. So B might not be right.

Option C: Only valid if they align with personal beliefs. Ross's view is that duties are objective, so they don't depend on personal beliefs. So C is likely incorrect.

Option D: Have no moral significance. That doesn't make sense because the whole point of prima facie duties is their moral consideration. So D is wrong.

Option E: Can be altered over time. Ross thought that duties are objective and not subject to change, so E is probably incorrect.

Option F: Can be proven. I'm not sure. Ross might have thought they are known through intuition, but proving them in a logical sense is questionable. Maybe F is not the best choice.

Option G: Cannot be known. Ross believed that we can know prima facie duties through intuition, so G is wrong.

Option H: Are not objective. Wait, no, Ross's duties are objective, so H is incorrect.

Option I: Are self-evident. Ross did talk about duties being self-evident, meaning they are known through intuition without proof. So I seems correct.

Wait, let me think again. I thought Ross's duties are objective, so they can be known, which would make I correct because they are self-evident. So the answer is I.

The answer is I.
