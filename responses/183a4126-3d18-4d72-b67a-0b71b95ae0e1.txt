Question:

F: None of the pairs are unifiable

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this unification problem. Hmm, unification is when two expressions can be made identical by substituting variables with terms. Right, so I need to look at each pair and see if substitutions can make them the same.

There are three expressions: I, II, and III.

Expression I is f(w, w). So it's a function f with two identical variables, w and w. Expression II is f(x, 1). Here, the second argument is a constant, 1. Expression III is f(y, g(z)). So the second argument is a function g applied to z.

Now, I need to check each possible pair: I and II, I and III, and II and III.

Starting with pair I and II: f(w,w) and f(x,1).

For these to be unifiable, we need to find substitutions that make them identical. Let's see. The first argument of I is w, and the first argument of II is x. So to unify, we can set w = x. Then the first arguments become the same. Now, the second arguments: I has w, II has 1. So we'd need w = 1. But wait, can a variable be substituted to a constant? I think yes, because substitution allows variables to be replaced by any term, including constants.

So if we substitute w → 1 and x → 1 (since w = x, and w is 1), then I becomes f(1,1) and II becomes f(1,1). So yes, they can be unified. So pair I and II is unifiable.

Next, pair I and III: f(w,w) and f(y, g(z)).

Looking for substitutions. The first arguments: w and y. So w can be set to y. Then the first arguments would match. Now the second arguments: w and g(z). So we need w = g(z). But w is already y, so y must be g(z). So substitution would be w → y, but y → g(z). Wait, but can variables be substituted to functions? Because y is a variable, and g(z) is a term. So substituting y with g(z) would make the second argument g(z) in both expressions.

Wait, let me think again. Expression I's second argument is w, and III's is g(z). So if we set w = g(z), then I becomes f(w, w) → f(g(z), g(z)), and III becomes f(y, g(z)). But for them to be identical, y must be substituted to g(z) as well. So we can have substitutions where w = g(z) and y = g(z). That would make both expressions f(g(z), g(z)). So yes, they can be unified. So pair I and III is unifiable.

Now, pair II and III: f(x, 1) and f(y, g(z)).

First arguments: x and y. So x can be set to y. Then, the second arguments: 1 and g(z). So we need 1 = g(z). Is that possible? Well, 1 is a constant, and g(z) is a function. So to make 1 equal to g(z), we'd have to substitute z with a value such that g(z) is 1. But z is a variable, so if we can set z to something that makes g(z) equal to 1. Wait, but substitution can only replace variables with terms, not change the function's structure. So unless g is a constant function that always returns 1, which we don't know, we can't assume that. So unless g(z) can be replaced with 1 via substitution, which would require that g is a constant function. But since g is a function symbol here, and we don't have any information about it, we can't make that assumption. Therefore, 1 and g(z) can't be unified because 1 is a constant and g(z) is a function term (unless z is substituted to make g(z) = 1, but that's only possible if g can take arguments that result in 1, which isn't guaranteed here). 

So, in this case, the second arguments can't be unified because 1 is a constant and g(z) is a function. So pair II and III are not unifiable.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Maybe I'm missing something. The substitution would need to make the second arguments equal. So for f(x,1) and f(y, g(z)), if x is set to y, then the first arguments match. Then, the second arguments are 1 and g(z). So for 1 to equal g(z), we'd need to have g(z) = 1. But substitution only allows replacing variables with terms. So z is a variable in g(z). So can we substitute z with a term such that g(z) becomes 1? Well, that depends on what g is. If g is a function that can take an argument to produce 1, like g(a) = 1, then z could be substituted to a. But since g is a function symbol, and we don't know its definition, we can't assume that. So in general, without knowing that g can produce 1, we can't unify the second arguments. So II and III are not unifiable.

So putting it all together:

I and II are unifiable.

I and III are unifiable.

II and III are not unifiable.

So which pairs are unifiable? I can pair with II and III. So the pairs are (I, II) and (I, III).

Looking back at the options:

Option C says (I, II) and (I, III) only.

Option I says (I, II) and (II, III) only. No, because II and III aren't unifiable.

Option A says (I, III) and (II, III) only. No, because II and III aren't unifiable.

So the correct answer should be option C.
</think>

The correct answer is C.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding Unification**: Two expressions are unifiable if substitutions for their variables can make them identical.

2. **Analyzing Each Pair**:
   - **Pair I and II**: f(w,w) and f(x,1).
     - Substitute w = x and w = 1. Both expressions become f(1,1), so they are unifiable.
   - **Pair I and III**: f(w,w) and f(y,g(z)).
     - Substitute w = y and y = g(z). Both expressions become f(g(z),g(z)), so they are unifiable.
   - **Pair II and III**: f(x,1) and f(y,g(z)).
     - Substitute x = y. The second arguments are 1 and g(z). Since 1 is a constant and g(z) is a function, they cannot be unified without knowing g's behavior. Thus, they are not unifiable.

3. **Conclusion**: Only pairs (I, II) and (I, III) are unifiable.

**Answer:** C
