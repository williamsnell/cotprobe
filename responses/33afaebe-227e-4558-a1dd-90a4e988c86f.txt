Alright, I'm trying to figure out which statement about the global aging population is correct. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says, "In older age groups, men outnumber women." I remember that globally, women generally live longer than men. So in older age groups, there should be more women than men. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B states, "The rate of increase in the median age of populations is slower in developing countries than wealthy countries." I think that wealthier countries have older populations because of better healthcare and lower birth rates. Developing countries might be catching up, so their median age is increasing faster. So B might be incorrect.

Option C claims, "The global aging population is decreasing due to advancements in healthcare." Wait, better healthcare should mean people live longer, so the aging population should be increasing, not decreasing. So C is likely wrong.

Option D says, "By 2050, the majority of the world's population will be under the age of 40." I think the trend is towards an older population. The majority might be older, so D might not be correct.

Option E: "Men have a lower mortality rate than women, over the life course." I've heard that women generally have lower mortality rates across most age groups. So E is probably incorrect.

Option F: "The rate of increase in the median age of populations is greater in developing countries than wealthy countries." As I thought earlier, developing countries are likely to have a faster-growing median age because their birth rates are declining and life expectancy is increasing. So F might be correct.

Option G: "In older age groups, the number of men and women is equal." Since women live longer, older age groups should have more women. So G is incorrect.

Putting it all together, the correct statement seems to be F.
