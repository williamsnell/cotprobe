<think>
Okay, so I've got this problem here about rainfall and heat released when water freezes. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it step by step.

First, the problem says that an inch of rain falls on New York, resulting in 19.8 × 10^9 liters of water. Then, the temperature drops to 0°C, causing the water to freeze. I need to find out how much heat is released during this freezing process. They also give me the enthalpy of fusion, ΔH_fus, as 1.4 Kcal per mole. Oh, and the density of rainwater is 1.00 g/cm³. 

Alright, so I remember that when a substance freezes, it releases heat. The formula I think I need is:

q = n × ΔH_fus

Wait, but wait. Since freezing is the opposite of melting, the heat released would be positive? Or is it negative? Well, I think in this context, we're just looking for the magnitude, so maybe the sign won't matter. Or perhaps the question is just about the amount of heat, so I'll proceed with the absolute value.

So, n is the number of moles of water. To find n, I need to calculate the moles from the given volume. Let's start by converting the volume of water into grams because moles can be found using molar mass.

The volume is 19.8 × 10^9 liters. Wait, that's a huge number. Let me convert that to cubic centimeters because 1 liter is 1000 cm³. So, 19.8 × 10^9 liters equals 19.8 × 10^12 cm³. 

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. 1 liter is 1000 cm³, so 19.8 × 10^9 liters is 19.8e9 * 1e3 cm³. That would be 19.8e12 cm³, which is 1.98 × 10^13 cm³. 

But wait, the density is 1.00 g/cm³. So, mass = density × volume. So, mass in grams is 1.00 g/cm³ × 1.98 × 10^13 cm³. That would be 1.98 × 10^13 grams. That's a lot of water—like, 19.8 trillion grams.

Now, convert grams to moles. The molar mass of water (H₂O) is approximately 18.015 g/mol. So, moles = mass / molar mass.

So, n = (1.98 × 10^13 g) / (18.015 g/mol). Let me compute that. Let's approximate 18.015 as 18 for simplicity.

n ≈ (1.98e13) / 18 ≈ 1.1e12 moles. Wait, no, let me do the calculation correctly. 

Wait, 1.98 divided by 18 is 0.11, so 0.11 × 10^13 is 1.1 × 10^12 moles. Hmm, that's 1.1 trillion moles. 

Wait, but let me check the actual division: 1.98 / 18 = 0.11 exactly. So yes, 1.1 × 10^12 moles.

Now, using the enthalpy of fusion, ΔH_fus is given as 1.4 Kcal per mole. Since freezing releases heat, the heat released (q) would be positive, so q = n × ΔH_fus.

So, q = 1.1e12 moles × 1.4 Kcal/mole. Let's compute that.

1.1 × 1.4 = 1.54. So, 1.54 × 10^12 Kcal. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the options are all in single Kcal numbers. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait a minute, the options are like 1.76, 0.98, etc. So 1.54 is one of the options, option E. But wait, that would be 1.54 × 10^12 Kcal, which is way too big. That can't be right because the options don't have such large numbers. So I must have messed up the units somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the volume calculation. Let me go back.

Wait, the problem says 19.8 × 10^9 liters. So 19.8e9 liters. Since 1 liter is 1e3 cm³, that's 19.8e9 * 1e3 = 19.8e12 cm³, which is 1.98e13 cm³. That part seems correct.

Density is 1.00 g/cm³, so mass is 1.98e13 grams. Molar mass of H2O is about 18 g/mol. So moles = 1.98e13 / 18 = approx 1.1e12 moles. That's correct.

But wait, 1.1e12 moles times 1.4 Kcal per mole would be 1.54e12 Kcal, which is way too big. The options are all single decimal numbers, so I must have gone wrong somewhere.

Wait a second, maybe the volume isn't 19.8e9 liters for the entire Earth? Wait, no, the problem says "falls on New York," which is a specific area. But the problem gives the volume as 19.8e9 liters without specifying the area. So perhaps that's the total volume over the entire area, but I'm not sure. Maybe I'm not accounting for something.

Wait, perhaps the question is wrong, or I'm missing a unit conversion. Let me check again.

Wait, 19.8 × 10^9 liters is 19.8e9 L. To convert liters to grams, using density 1 g/cm³: 1 L = 1000 cm³, so 19.8e9 L × 1000 cm³/L = 19.8e12 cm³. Mass = density × volume = 1 g/cm³ × 19.8e12 cm³ = 19.8e12 grams, which is 1.98e13 grams. That seems correct.

Molar mass of H2O is 18.015 g/mol. So moles = 1.98e13 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 1.1e12 moles.

Then, ΔH_fus is 1.4 Kcal/mol. So heat released when freezing is q = n × ΔH_fus = 1.1e12 × 1.4 = 1.54e12 Kcal. But the options are all in single Kcal, so I'm definitely missing something here.

Wait, maybe the units for ΔH_fus are different. Let me check: the problem says ΔH_fus is 1.4 Kcal per mole. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I got the volume wrong. Oh wait, wait a second. Wait, 1 inch of rain over an area. But the problem says "falls on New York" and gives the rainfall as 19.8e9 liters. So perhaps that's the total volume regardless of area. But perhaps I'm not supposed to calculate the moles but use some other approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should convert the volume into moles directly.

Wait, another approach: find out how many moles are in 19.8e9 liters of water, considering that 1 mole of water has a certain volume at 1 atm. Wait, but I don't remember the molar volume of water. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute moles using mass.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach. Maybe the problem is expecting me to compute the energy released when the water freezes, but perhaps I'm supposed to use the heat of fusion correctly.

Wait, when water freezes, it releases heat because it's exothermic. So q = n × ΔH_fus.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me go through each step again.

1. Volume of rain = 19.8e9 liters.

2. Convert liters to cm³: 1 liter = 1000 cm³, so 19.8e9 L = 19.8e12 cm³.

3. Mass = density × volume = 1 g/cm³ × 19.8e12 cm³ = 19.8e12 grams.

4. Molar mass of H2O is 18.015 g/mol. So moles = mass / molar mass = (19.8e12 g) / (18.015 g/mol) ≈ (19.8 / 18.015) × 1e12 ≈ 1.10 × 1e12 moles.

5. Heat released, q = moles × ΔH_fus = 1.1e12 mol × 1.4 Kcal/mol = 1.54e12 Kcal.

Wait, that's 1.54 × 10^12 kilocalories. But the options are all between 0.7 and 2.2 Kcal. So this can't be right. I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait a minute, perhaps I messed up the volume unit conversion. Let me think again.

Wait, 1 inch of rain over what area? Oh wait, the problem says "falls on New York," but it gives the total volume as 19.8 × 10^9 liters, so perhaps it's the total volume for the entire area. But maybe I'm not supposed to calculate the moles based on the entire volume. Wait, no, the problem states the volume directly, so I should use that.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I'm misreading it. Let me check the problem again:

"When an inch of rain falls on New York, it results in a rainfall of 19.8 × 10^9 liters."

Wait, 19.8 × 10^9 liters is 19.8e9 liters, which is 19.8 billion liters. That's a lot. For example, an inch of rain over New York City (which is about 300 square miles or 778 square km) would result in a certain volume. Let me check what 19.8e9 liters would be in terms of cubic meters: 19.8e9 liters = 19.8e9 * 0.001 = 19.8e6 cubic meters, which is 1.98e7 m³. That's a huge volume, but perhaps it's correct.

But regardless, I have to work with the numbers given. So perhaps the problem expects me to compute the heat released for the given volume, but the options are way smaller. So maybe I made a mistake in the molar mass.

Wait, molar mass of H2O is 2(1.008) + 16.00 = 18.016 g/mol. So using 18.016 instead of 18, moles would be 19.8e12 g / 18.016 g/mol ≈ (19.8 / 18.016) × 1e12 ≈ 1.10 × 1e12 moles. So same as before.

Hmm, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate not in moles but in something else. Wait, maybe I messed up the exponent. Let me check the volume again.

Wait, 19.8 × 10^9 liters is 19.8e9 liters. But 1 liter is 1e-3 m³, so 19.8e9 liters = 19.8e6 m³. So that's 1.98e7 m³. Then, the mass would be 19.8e6 * 1000 kg/m³ (since 1 m³ of water is 1000 kg). Wait, no, wait: density is 1 g/cm³, which is 1000 kg/m³. So mass is 1.98e7 m³ × 1000 kg/m³ = 1.98e10 kg. Wait, that's 1.98e10 kg, which is 1.98e13 grams. So that matches my earlier calculation.

So the mass is correct. So moles are 1.98e13 grams / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 1.1e12 moles.

Then, q = 1.1e12 × 1.4 = 1.54e12 Kcal. But that's way too big. The options are all under 3 Kcal. So I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the heat released per unit mass or per mole. Or maybe I'm using the wrong value for enthalpy. Let me recheck the problem.

The problem says ΔH_fus is 1.4 Kcal per mole. Oh wait, wait a second. When water freezes, it releases heat, so the enthalpy change is negative. But since the question is about how much heat is released, we take the absolute value. So the calculation is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I misread the exponent. Let me check the question again.

Ah! Wait, the problem says 19.8 × 10^9 liters, which is 19.8e9 liters. But wait, 19.8 × 10^9 is 19.8e9, which is 19,800,000,000 liters. That's a massive amount. But perhaps I should think about it in terms of per liter or something else.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is asking how much heat is released when this much water freezes, but perhaps I'm supposed to use the molar enthalpy in a different way.

Alternatively, maybe the problem has a miscalculation in the volume. Let me think: 19.8 × 10^9 liters is 19.8e9 liters. To find the mass, that's 19.8e9 liters × 1 g/cm³ × 1 cm³/0.001 liters = 19.8e9 × 1 g. So 19.8e9 grams, which is 1.98e10 grams. Wait, no, wait: density is 1 g/cm³, and 1 liter is 1000 cm³. So 19.8e9 liters × 1000 cm³/liter = 19.8e12 cm³. Mass is 1 g/cm³ × 19.8e12 cm³ = 19.8e12 grams. Oh wait, I think I made a mistake earlier: 19.8e12 grams, not 1.98e13. Wait, no, 19.8e12 is 1.98e13. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the moles again. 19.8e12 grams / 18.015 g/mol ≈ (19.8 / 18.015) × 1e12 ≈ 1.10 × 1e12 moles.

So 1.1e12 moles × 1.4 Kcal/mole = 1.54e12 Kcal. But the options don't go that high. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's not the entire volume freezing, but something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is in imperial units, and I'm supposed to convert inches to something else. But the volume is given in liters, so that shouldn't affect it.

Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the heat released per mole, but that doesn't make sense because the options are single Kcal values. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the moles correctly. Let's compute 19.8e12 grams / 18.015 g/mol.

19.8e12 / 18.015 = let's compute 19.8 / 18.015 first.

19.8 ÷ 18.015 ≈ 1.10.

So 1.10 × 1e12 = 1.1e12 moles. Correct.

So 1.1e12 × 1.4 = 1.54e12 Kcal. But that's way too big. The options are all in single-digit Kcal.

Wait a minute, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the volume is 19.8 × 10^-9 liters, not 10^9. That would make the volume 1.98e-8 liters, which is 19.8e-9 liters, a more manageable number.

But the problem says 19.8 × 10^9 liters. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using grams instead of liters? No, the volume is given as liters.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the problem differently. Maybe I'm supposed to find the heat released per mole and then multiply by the number of moles, but I think that's what I did.

Wait, maybe the problem expects me to find the heat released in kilojoules, not kilocalories. But the question says Kcal, so no.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the heat released when the water freezes, but I'm calculating the heat released when it melts. Wait, no. The freezing process releases heat, so the heat of fusion is exothermic when freezing. So the calculation is correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is expecting me to calculate using the molar mass in a different way. Let me think: 19.8e9 liters × density × molar mass.

No, I think I've done that correctly.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the molar mass in kg or some other unit. Let me try again.

Wait, 19.8e9 liters × 1000 cm³/L = 19.8e12 cm³. Mass = 19.8e12 g. Molar mass is 18.015 g/mol. So moles = 19.8e12 / 18.015 ≈ 1.1e12.

Hmm, same result.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of fusion is given as 1.4 Kcal per gram? No, the problem says per mole.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion for the volume. Let me confirm: 1 liter is 1000 cm³, correct. So 19.8e9 liters = 19.8e9 × 1000 = 19.8e12 cm³. Correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is that I'm using the entire volume for the entire Earth, but perhaps it's just for a small area. But the problem states the volume as 19.8e9 liters regardless of the area.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to think about the latent heat in a different way. Let me think: when water freezes, it releases heat equal to the heat of fusion multiplied by the number of moles.

Wait, perhaps I should use the molar mass correctly. Let me compute 19.8e12 grams / 18.015 g/mol = (19.8 / 18.015) × 1e12 ≈ 1.10 × 1e12 moles. So that's correct.

Then, q = 1.1e12 × 1.4 = 1.54e12 Kcal. But the options don't have that. So I'm really confused.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the energy in joules, but the question says Kcal. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial volume to mass conversion. Let me recheck:

19.8 × 10^9 liters is 19.8e9 liters.

1 liter = 1000 cm³, so 19.8e9 liters = 19.8e12 cm³.

Mass = density × volume = 1 g/cm³ × 19.8e12 cm³ = 19.8e12 grams.

Molar mass H2O is 18.015 g/mol.

Moles = 19.8e12 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 1.1e12 moles.

ΔH_fus = 1.4 Kcal/mol.

q = 1.1e12 × 1.4 = 1.54e12 Kcal.

But the options are much lower, so perhaps I'm missing a factor of 10^something.

Wait, wait, perhaps the volume is 19.8 × 10^9 liters, but I'm supposed to express it in a different unit, like cubic meters. Let me try that.

Wait, 19.8e9 liters × (1 m³ / 1000 liters) = 19.8e6 m³.

Mass = density × volume = 1000 kg/m³ × 19.8e6 m³ = 1.98e10 kg.

Convert kg to grams: 1.98e10 kg × 1000 g/kg = 1.98e13 grams. Same as before.

Molar mass is 18.015 g/mol.

Moles = 1.98e13 / 18.015 ≈ 1.1e12 moles.

q = 1.1e12 × 1.4 = 1.54e12 Kcal.

Still the same result. So I'm stuck. The calculation leads me to 1.54e12 Kcal, but the options don't have that. The closest option is E: 1.54 Kcal, but that's way too small.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the number of moles. Let me compute 19.8e12 grams divided by 18.015 g/mol precisely.

19.8e12 / 18.015 = ?

Let me compute 19.8 / 18.015 first.

19.8 ÷ 18.015:

18.015 × 1.1 = 19.8165. So 19.8 ÷ 18.015 ≈ 1.099, approximately 1.1.

So 1.099 × 1e12 ≈ 1.1e12 moles.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using 1.4 KJ/mol instead of Kcal/mol? No, the problem says Kcal.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. The calculation leads me to 1.54e12 Kcal, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, another thought: maybe the problem is asking for the heat released in calories, not kilocalories. But the problem states Kcal, which is kilocalories. Wait, but sometimes people use Cal with a capital C as kilocalories, and cal with lowercase as calories. So maybe the problem is in calories, but the options are in Kcal. Hmm, no, the options are in Kcal.

Wait, perhaps I should check the molar mass again. Wait, H2O: H is 1.008 each, so 2×1.008=2.016, plus O is 16.00, so total 18.016 g/mol. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use 18 g/mol for simplicity, which would make moles = 19.8e12 / 18 = 1.1e12. So same as before.

Hmm. I'm not seeing where I could have gone wrong. The calculation seems correct, but the result doesn't match any of the options. Maybe the problem has a typo, or I'm missing a key point.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the given volume is per square inch or per some area, but the problem doesn't specify. It just gives the total volume as 19.8e9 liters. So I think I have to proceed with that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the heat released in a different way, such as using specific heat capacity, but no, this is about phase change, so enthalpy of fusion is the right approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when water freezes, it releases heat, but the calculation is correct. So perhaps the intended answer is 1.54e12 Kcal, but looking at the options, E is 1.54 Kcal. That's a possible typo, where the exponent was omitted. If that's the case, then E would be the answer.

But that's a big assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to find the heat released in a different unit, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in converting liters to grams. Let me double-check:

19.8 × 10^9 liters × 1000 cm³/liter = 19.8 × 10^12 cm³.

Mass = 1 g/cm³ × 19.8 × 10^12 cm³ = 19.8 × 10^12 grams.

Yes, that's correct.

So I'm stuck. Based on my calculations, the answer should be 1.54e12 Kcal, but that's not among the options. The only option close is E: 1.54 Kcal. So perhaps the intended answer is E, despite the discrepancy in the exponent.
</think>

To determine the heat released when 19.8 × 10^9 liters of water freezes, we start by calculating the mass of the water. Given the density of water is 1.00 g/cm³, the mass is:

\[
\text{Mass} = \text{Density} \times \text{Volume} = 1.00 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \times 19.8 \times 10^{12} \, \text{cm}^3 = 19.8 \times 10^{12} \, \text{g}.
\]

Next, we convert the mass to moles using the molar mass of water, \( \text{H}_2\text{O} \), which is approximately 18.015 g/mol:

\[
\text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{19.8 \times 10^{12} \, \text{g}}{18.015 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 1.1 \times 10^{12} \, \text{mol}.
\]

The heat released when water freezes is calculated using the enthalpy of fusion, \( \Delta H_{\text{fus}} = 1.4 \, \text{Kcal/mol} \):

\[
q = n \times \Delta H_{\text{fus}} = 1.1 \times 10^{12} \, \text{mol} \times 1.4 \, \text{Kcal/mol} = 1.54 \times 10^{12} \, \text{Kcal}.
\]

However, the options provided are in single-digit Kcal values, suggesting a potential discrepancy in the problem's units or scaling. Among the given options, the closest match is **E: 1.54 Kcal**, which may reflect a typo or simplification in the problem's presentation.

**Answer: E**
