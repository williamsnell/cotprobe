Question:

Find the Laplace transform of f(t) = t^n, where n is a positive integer.

Options:

A: n^n / s^n
B: n! / s^n+1
C: n! / s^n+2
D: (n+1)! / s^n
E: n! / s^n
F: n! / (s+1)^n
G: n! / s^n-1
H: (n-1)! / s^n+1
I: (n+1)! / s^n+2
J: n! / (s-1)^n+1

Okay, so I need to find the Laplace transform of f(t) = t^n, where n is a positive integer. Hmm, I remember Laplace transforms are used to convert time-domain functions into the frequency domain. The Laplace transform of t^n... I think there's a standard formula for this.

Wait, I recall that the Laplace transform of t^k is related to factorials or gamma functions. Oh right, more specifically, I think the formula is something like L{t^n} = n! / s^(n+1). But wait, let me make sure.

I remember that for n=0, t^0 is 1, and the Laplace transform of 1 is 1/s. So plugging n=0 into n! gives 0! which is 1, and s^(0+1) is s. So that matches. For n=1, t^1 is t. The Laplace transform of t is 1/s^2. Using the formula, n! is 1! =1, and s^(1+1)=s², so again it matches. For n=2, t²'s transform should be 2! / s^3, which is 2/s³. I think that's correct because I've seen that before.

Looking at the options, option B is n! / s^(n+1), which fits with what I just thought. Let me check the other options to be sure. Option E is n! / s^n, which would be missing the +1 in the denominator. So that's incorrect. Option H has (n-1)! which doesn't fit the factorial part. Option I has (n+1)! which is higher than needed. So I think option B is the correct one.

The Laplace transform of \( f(t) = t^n \) is \( \frac{n!}{s^{n+1}} \), which matches option B.

Answer: B
