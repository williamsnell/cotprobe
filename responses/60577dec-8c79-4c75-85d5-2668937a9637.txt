Okay, so I've got this integral to solve: the surface integral of the curl of vector A dot da over the surface S. The vector field A is given as y i + z j + x k. The surface S is the paraboloid z = 1 - x² - y², with z ≥ 0. Hmm, I need to find the value of this integral and choose the correct option from A to J.

Let me start by recalling some vector calculus. The integral of the curl of a vector field over a surface is equal to the circulation of the vector field around the boundary of that surface, thanks to Stokes' theorem. So, instead of computing the surface integral directly, maybe I can convert it into a line integral around the curve that is the boundary of S.

But wait, what's the boundary of S? The surface is a paraboloid opening downward because z is positive. The equation z = 1 - x² - y² implies that when z=0, x² + y² = 1. So the boundary curve C is the circle of radius 1 in the plane z=0. So the curve C is the circle x² + y² = 1, z=0.

Stokes' theorem says that the integral over S of (curl A) · da equals the integral over C of A · dr. So I can compute the line integral instead, which might be easier.

First, I'll compute the curl of A. Let me write A as (y, z, x). The curl is the determinant of the following matrix:

i | j | k
∂/∂x | ∂/∂y | ∂/∂z
y | z | x

So, curl A = ( ∂x/∂y - ∂z/∂z ) i - ( ∂x/∂x - ∂y/∂z ) j + ( ∂y/∂x - ∂z/∂y ) k.

Wait, let's compute each component step by step.

The i-component is ∂A_z/∂y - ∂A_y/∂z. A_z is x, so ∂x/∂y = 0. A_y is z, so ∂z/∂z = 1. So i-component is 0 - 1 = -1.

The j-component is ∂A_x/∂z - ∂A_z/∂x. A_x is y, so ∂y/∂z = 0. A_z is x, so ∂x/∂x =1. So j-component is 0 -1 = -1.

Wait, but wait, the curl formula is (∂A_z/∂y - ∂A_y/∂z) i - (∂A_z/∂x - ∂A_x/∂z) j + (∂A_y/∂x - ∂A_x/∂y) k. Wait, maybe I should double-check the signs. The curl is:

(∂A_z/∂y - ∂A_y/∂z) i
- (∂A_z/∂x - ∂A_x/∂z) j
+ (∂A_y/∂x - ∂A_x/∂y) k.

So let's compute each part:

i-component: ∂(x)/∂y - ∂(z)/∂z. ∂x/∂y is 0. ∂z/∂z is 1. So i-component is 0 - 1 = -1.

j-component: -(∂(x)/∂x - ∂(y)/∂z). ∂x/∂x is 1. ∂y/∂z is 0. So j-component is -(1 - 0) = -1.

k-component: ∂(z)/∂x - ∂(y)/∂y. ∂z/∂x is 0. ∂y/∂y is 1. So k-component is 0 -1 = -1.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the k-component is ∂A_y/∂x - ∂A_x/∂y. A_y is z, so ∂z/∂x is 0. A_x is y, so ∂y/∂y is 1. So k-component is 0 -1 = -1.

So curl A is (-1, -1, -1). Hmm, that's the curl vector.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me compute it again to be sure.

Using the determinant method:

i ( ∂A_z/∂y - ∂A_y/∂z ) 
- j ( ∂A_z/∂x - ∂A_x/∂z )
+ k ( ∂A_y/∂x - ∂A_x/∂y )

So,

i ( ∂x/∂y - ∂z/∂z ) = i (0 - 1) = -i.

-j ( ∂x/∂x - ∂y/∂z ) = -j (1 - 0) = -j.

+k ( ∂z/∂x - ∂y/∂y ) = k (0 - 1) = -k.

So curl A = -i -j -k. Yup, that's (-1, -1, -1).

Now, using Stokes' theorem, the surface integral of curl A · da equals the line integral of A · dr around the boundary C.

So I need to compute the line integral of A · dr over the curve C, which is the circle x² + y² =1, z=0.

Parametrizing the curve C: since it's a circle in the z=0 plane, radius 1, centered at origin. Let me use polar coordinates:

x = cosθ,
y = sinθ,
z = 0,
where θ goes from 0 to 2π.

So, position vector r(θ) = cosθ i + sinθ j + 0 k.

Then, dr/dθ = -sinθ i + cosθ j + 0 k.

So, dr = (-sinθ dθ) i + (cosθ dθ) j + 0 k.

Now, vector A at any point on C is (y, z, x). But on C, z=0, so A becomes (y, 0, x). Substituting y = sinθ and x = cosθ, so A = (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

Now, compute A · dr. So, A · dr = (sinθ)(-sinθ dθ) + (0)(cosθ dθ) + (cosθ)(0) = -sin²θ dθ.

Therefore, the line integral is ∫(from θ=0 to θ=2π) of (-sin²θ) dθ.

Hmm, that's the integral of -sin²θ from 0 to 2π.

I can simplify this by noting that sin²θ has a period of π, so integrating over 0 to 2π is twice the integral from 0 to π.

But let me compute it directly.

The integral of sin²θ dθ over 0 to 2π is equal to π, because ∫ sin²θ dθ over 0 to 2π is 2π*(1/2) = π. Wait, because ∫ sin²θ dθ over 0 to 2π = π.

So, our integral is ∫ (-sin²θ) dθ from 0 to 2π = -π.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute it step by step.

The integral of sin²θ over a full period (0 to 2π) is π. So, ∫0^{2π} sin²θ dθ = π.

So, ∫0^{2π} (-sin²θ) dθ = -π.

Therefore, the line integral is equal to -π.

So, by Stokes' theorem, the surface integral of curl A · da is equal to -π.

Wait, but let me check if I applied Stokes' theorem correctly. The surface integral is the flux of curl A through the surface S. The line integral is the circulation of A around the boundary C. So, I think I did it correctly.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the surface integral directly to confirm. But that might take longer.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in parametrizing the curve or in the curl calculation. Let me double-check.

Curl A: (-1, -1, -1). Correct.

Parametrization of C: x=cosθ, y=sinθ, z=0. Correct.

A at C: (y, 0, x) = (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Correct.

dr: (-sinθ, cosθ, 0) dθ. Correct.

Dot product: sinθ*(-sinθ) + 0*cosθ + cosθ*0 = -sin²θ. Correct.

Integral: ∫0^{2π} -sin²θ dθ = -π. So the line integral is -π, which equals the surface integral.

Looking at the options, I see option I is -π, option E is -π/2, etc.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Options are from A to J.

Wait, the options are:

A: 2π

B: π

C: π/2

D:4π

E: -π/2

F: -2π

G:3π

H:0

I: -π

J: -3π

So, the answer would be I: -π.

Wait, but wait, I just got -π as the result. So the correct option is I.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the surface integral directly without Stokes' theorem to see if I get the same result.

So, the surface S is z = 1 - x² - y², with z ≥ 0.

To compute the surface integral ∫∫_S (curl A) · da, which is ∫∫_S (curl A) · n da, where n is the unit normal vector to the surface.

The parametrization of S can be in terms of x and y, with z = 1 - x² - y².

The normal vector can be found using the gradient of F, where F(x,y,z) = z - (1 - x² - y²) =0.

So, grad F = (2x, 2y, 1).

The normal vector n is grad F normalized. But for the flux integral, we can use this unnormalized vector and adjust with the scaling factor.

But the orientation matters. Since the paraboloid opens downward (as z decreases with x² + y² increasing), the upward normal would point towards the region where z is higher, but I think in the standard orientation, the normal points outward. Wait, but for the surface z = f(x,y), the upward normal is given by (-∂f/∂x, -∂f/∂y, 1). So for f(x,y)=1 -x² -y², ∂f/∂x = -2x, ∂f/∂y = -2y.

So, the upward normal vector would be (2x, 2y, 1), because the standard formula for the normal vector when z = f(x,y) is (-f_x, -f_y, 1). Wait, no: Wait, the formula for the upward normal is (-∂f/∂x, -∂f/∂y, 1). So for f(x,y) =1 -x² - y², f_x = -2x, f_y = -2y. So, the normal vector would be (2x, 2y, 1). So, the unit normal is (2x, 2y, 1) divided by its magnitude.

But for the flux integral, I can use the vector (2x, 2y, 1) without normalizing, and then compute the dot product with curl A, which is (-1, -1, -1).

So, (curl A) · n = (-1)(2x) + (-1)(2y) + (-1)(1) = -2x -2y -1.

Then, the flux integral becomes ∫∫_{D} (-2x -2y -1) dx dy, where D is the projection of S onto the xy-plane, which is x² + y² ≤1.

So, I need to compute ∫∫_{D} (-2x -2y -1) dx dy.

Let me compute each term separately.

First, ∫∫ (-2x) dx dy over D.

Because the region D is symmetric about the y-axis, and the integrand is an odd function in x, the integral of -2x over D will be zero.

Similarly, ∫∫ (-2y) dx dy over D will also be zero, because it's an odd function in y.

So, the only term that remains is ∫∫ (-1) dx dy over D, which is - times the area of D.

The area of D, which is the unit circle, is π(1)^2 = π.

So, the integral becomes -π.

Which matches the result from Stokes' theorem. So, the surface integral is indeed -π.

So, the correct answer is I: -π.
</think>

The integral is evaluated using Stokes' theorem, converting the surface integral into a line integral around the boundary of the paraboloid, which is the circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\) in the plane \(z=0\). Parametrizing the boundary curve and computing the line integral yields a result of \(-\pi\). This is confirmed by directly computing the surface integral, which also gives \(-\pi\).
