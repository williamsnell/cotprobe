Okay, so I have this problem here about functions and their graphs. Let me try to break it down step by step. The problem says that the graph of y = f(x) includes the points (1,5), (2,3), and (3,1). I need to find two points that must be on the graph of y = f(f(x)), and then calculate ab + cd where the points are (a,b) and (c,d). The options are given from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I should recall what f(f(x)) means. It's a composition of the function f with itself. So, for any x, f(f(x)) is f evaluated at f(x). That means I have to apply the function f twice.

Given the points on f(x): (1,5), (2,3), (3,1). So, when x is 1, f(1) is 5; when x is 2, f(2) is 3; and when x is 3, f(3) is 1.

I need to find points (x, f(f(x))) for some x values. The points on f(f(x)) would be x and f(f(x)). So, for each x, I can compute f(f(x)) if I know f(x) and then f of that result.

Let's list the known f(x) mappings again:

f(1) = 5

f(2) = 3

f(3) = 1

Now, I can try plugging in x values where f(x) is known, so that f(f(x)) can be computed.

Let me see which x's I can use. The given points are x=1,2,3. So, let's compute f(f(x)) for each of these x's where possible.

Starting with x=1:

f(1) = 5. Now, to find f(f(1)), which is f(5). But wait, I don't know what f(5) is because the given points only go up to x=3. So, f(5) is unknown. Therefore, I can't find f(f(1)) because f(5) isn't provided. So, x=1 might not help me directly.

Next, x=2:

f(2) = 3. Then f(f(2)) = f(3). Oh, wait, f(3) is given as 1. So, f(f(2)) = 1. Therefore, the point (2,1) is on the graph of y = f(f(x)).

That's one point: (2,1).

Now, x=3:

f(3) = 1. Then f(f(3)) = f(1). We know f(1) is 5. So, f(f(3)) = 5. Therefore, the point (3,5) is on the graph of y = f(f(x)).

That's the second point: (3,5).

So, the two points we can definitely find on y = f(f(x)) are (2,1) and (3,5). 

Now, the problem says these are the two points, and we call them (a,b) and (c,d). We need to compute ab + cd.

Let's assign (a,b) as (2,1) and (c,d) as (3,5). Alternatively, it could be the other way around, but since multiplication is commutative, it won't matter.

Compute ab: 2 * 1 = 2

Compute cd: 3 * 5 = 15

Adding them together: 2 + 15 = 17

Looking at the options, B is 17. So, the answer should be B.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't miss any other points. Are there any other x's where f(f(x)) can be computed? Let's see:

What about x=5? Well, we don't know f(5), so we can't compute f(f(5)). Similarly, for x=1, as before, f(1)=5, but f(5) is unknown.

What about x=4? We don't have any info on f(4), so no.

So, only x=2 and x=3 give us f(f(x)) that can be determined from the given points.

Thus, the two points are (2,1) and (3,5). Multiplying each pair and adding gives 2*1 + 3*5 = 2 + 15 =17, which is option B.

The two points on the graph of y = f(f(x)) are (2,1) and (3,5). Calculating ab + cd gives 2*1 + 3*5 = 2 + 15 = 17.

Answer: B
