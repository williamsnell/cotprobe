Okay, so I've got this problem about a bird lost in a 3x3x3 cubical maze. The bird flies around randomly, and I need to find the entropy rate of this random walk. The answer should be in bits using base 2 logarithm. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that entropy rate in the context of a Markov chain is the expected value of the entropy per step. So I need to model the bird's movement as a Markov process. Each room is a state, and the transitions depend on the number of possible exits from that room.

The maze is a 3x3x3 cube. So there are 27 rooms in total. Each room's number of exits depends on its position:

- Corner rooms have 3 exits.
- Edge rooms (but not corners) have 4 exits.
- Face centers have 5 exits.
- The very center of the cube has 6 exits.

Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. In a cube, each room can be categorized based on how many walls are exposed.

Wait, in a 3x3x3 cube, the positions can be categorized based on how many dimensions are at the extremes. So:

- Corner rooms: 8 in total, each has 3 exits (since they are at the intersection of three walls).
- Edge rooms: Each edge of the cube has (3-2)=1 room that's not a corner but on the edge. There are 12 edges, so 12 rooms. Each edge room has 4 exits.
- Face centers: Each face has (3-2)*(3-2)=1 room in the center of the face. There are 6 faces, so 6 rooms. Each face center has 5 exits.
- The very center of the cube: 1 room, which has 6 exits (since it's surrounded on all sides).

Wait, let me double-check that. For a 3x3x3 cube, each corner has 3 exits. Then, edges: each edge has 3 cubes, but the two at the ends are corners, so the middle one is an edge room. There are 12 edges, so 12 edge rooms, each with 4 exits. Then each face has a center room, 6 in total, each with 5 exits. And the very center is 1 room with 6 exits.

So the total number of rooms is 8 + 12 + 6 + 1 = 27, which checks out.

Now, the bird moves from one room to an adjacent room with equal probability through each wall. So from any room, the number of possible next rooms is equal to the number of exits (since each exit leads to one adjacent room).

So, for each room, the transition probability to each adjacent room is 1/(number of exits). So for a corner room, each exit has probability 1/3, and there are 3 possible next states. Similarly, edge rooms have 4 exits, so each transition is 1/4, etc.

To find the entropy rate, I think I need to model this as a Markov chain and compute the entropy per step. The entropy rate is given by the limit as n approaches infinity of (1/n) * H(X₁, X₂, ..., Xₙ), which, for an irreducible and aperiodic Markov chain, is the entropy of the stationary distribution.

Wait, no, actually, the entropy rate for a Markov chain is the expected value of the entropy of the next state given the current state, which is the same as the entropy of the transition distribution. Alternatively, for a stationary distribution π, the entropy rate is the sum over all states i of π_i * H_i, where H_i is the entropy of the transition probabilities from state i.

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, the entropy rate H is the average entropy per step, which for a Markov chain is the entropy of the stationary distribution. Or maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, let me think again. The entropy rate is defined as the limit of (1/n) * H(X₁, ..., Xₙ) as n goes to infinity. For a stationary Markov chain, this is equal to the entropy of the stationary distribution per step. Alternatively, it's the expected entropy of the next state given the current state.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to compute the entropy rate using the stationary distribution and the transition probabilities.

So first, I need to find the stationary distribution π for the Markov chain. The stationary distribution π satisfies π = π P, where P is the transition matrix.

In a regular grid like this, the stationary distribution should be uniform if the chain is symmetric, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, because the number of exits (i.e., the number of possible transitions) varies depending on the room's position. So the stationary distribution won't be uniform.

Let me recall that for a symmetric graph where each node has the same degree, the stationary distribution is uniform. But in this case, the graph isn't regular because the corner rooms have degree 3, edges 4, face centers 5, and the center 6. So the stationary distribution won't be uniform.

To find π, I can set up the balance equations. For each state i, π_i = sum over j of π_j * P(j → i).

Alternatively, since the chain is symmetric, perhaps I can group the states by their type (corner, edge, face, center) and find the stationary distribution over these aggregated states.

Let me denote:

- C: corner rooms, 8 in total, each with 3 exits.
- E: edge rooms, 12 in total, each with 4 exits.
- F: face centers, 6 in total, each with 5 exits.
- M: the center of the cube, 1 room, with 6 exits.

Wait, no, the center is M, and it's only one room.

So, the stationary distribution π will have components π_C, π_E, π_F, π_M, each multiplied by the number of rooms in that category.

But maybe it's easier to model the stationary distribution per room, considering their types.

Let me consider the transition rates. Since each room's transitions are determined by the number of exits, perhaps the stationary distribution can be found by considering the number of ways to get into each room.

In a symmetric Markov chain like this, the stationary distribution π_i is proportional to the degree of node i, which is the number of exits from that room. So π_i ∝ degree(i).

Wait, in a regular graph, the stationary distribution is uniform, but in an irregular graph, it's proportional to the degree. So yes, I think for an undirected graph, the stationary distribution π_i is proportional to the degree of node i.

Wait, but in this case, the graph is a 3D grid, which is connected and undirected. So the stationary distribution π_i is proportional to the degree of each node i.

So for each room, π_i = degree(i) / (2 * number of edges). Wait, because in an undirected graph, the sum of degrees is 2E, so the sum of π_i would be sum(degree(i)) / (2E) = (2E)/(2E) = 1.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, π_i = degree(i) / (2E), where E is the total number of edges in the graph. But in this case, each edge is bidirectional, so each exit corresponds to an edge.

Wait, but in our case, the transition is from a room to an adjacent room, so each edge is counted once. So the total number of edges can be calculated based on the number of rooms and their degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the stationary distribution by considering the number of ways to enter each room.

So for each room, π_i is proportional to the number of ways to enter it, which is equal to the degree of i.

So, for example, a corner room has 3 exits, so it can be entered from 3 other rooms. Similarly, an edge room has 4 exits, so it can be entered from 4 rooms, etc.

Wait, that makes sense. So the stationary distribution π_i is proportional to the number of ways to reach i, which is the degree of i.

So the stationary distribution π_i = degree(i) / (2E), where E is the total number of edges.

So first, let's compute the total number of edges E.

Each corner room has 3 exits, edge rooms have 4, face centers 5, and the center 6.

But each edge is shared between two rooms, so the total number of edges is (8*3 + 12*4 + 6*5 + 1*6)/2.

Calculating:

8 corners: 8 * 3 = 24
12 edges: 12 *4 =48
6 face centers:6 *5=30
1 center:1 *6=6
Total sum: 24 +48=72; 72+30=102; 102+6=108.

Divide by 2: E=54.

So E=54 edges.

Now, the sum of degrees is 108, which equals 2E as expected (since 2*54=108).

So the stationary distribution for each room is:

π_i = degree(i) / 108.

So for each corner room, π_C = 3/108 = 1/36.

Each edge room, π_E =4/108=1/27.

Each face center, π_F=5/108.

The center room, π_M=6/108=1/18.

Wait, but there are 8 corner rooms, 12 edge rooms, 6 face centers, and 1 center room.

So the total π for each category is:

- Corners: 8*(1/36) = 8/36 = 2/9 ≈0.2222
- Edges: 12*(1/27)=12/27=4/9≈0.4444
- Face centers:6*(5/108)=30/108=5/18≈0.2778
- Center:1*(1/18)=1/18≈0.0556

Wait, let me check: 2/9 +4/9=6/9=2/3. 5/18 +1/18=6/18=1/3. So 2/3 +1/3=1. Correct.

Now, the entropy rate is calculated as the expected entropy per step. So for each state i, the entropy is the entropy of the transition probabilities from i, and the overall entropy rate is the expected value of these entropies weighted by the stationary distribution π.

So H = sum_{i} π_i * H_i, where H_i is the entropy of the transition distribution from state i.

Each H_i is calculated as -sum_{j} P(i→j) log2 P(i→j).

So for each room type, we can compute H_i.

Let's do this for each category:

1. Corner rooms (C): 3 exits, so each transition has probability 1/3.

H_C = -3*(1/3 log2(1/3)) = -3*( (1/3)(-log2 3) ) )= 3*( (1/3) log2 3 )= log2 3 ≈1.58496 bits.

2. Edge rooms (E): 4 exits, each with probability 1/4.

H_E = -4*(1/4 log2 (1/4)) = -4*( (1/4)(-2) )= 4*( (1/4)*2 )= 2 bits.

3. Face centers (F): 5 exits, each with probability 1/5.

H_F = -5*(1/5 log2(1/5))= -5*( (1/5)(-log2 5) )=5*( (1/5) log2 5 )= log2 5 ≈2.32193 bits.

4. Center room (M): 6 exits, each with probability 1/6.

H_M = -6*(1/6 log2(1/6))= -6*( (1/6)(-log2 6) )=6*( (1/6) log2 6 )= log2 6 ≈2.58496 bits.

Now, the entropy rate H is the weighted average of these H_i values, weighted by their stationary probabilities π_i.

But wait, π_i is the stationary probability for each room, so each corner room contributes π_C * H_C, and so on.

So:

H = π_C * H_C + π_E * H_E + π_F * H_F + π_M * H_M.

Plugging in the numbers:

π_C = 1/36 ≈0.027778
H_C ≈1.58496

π_E =1/27≈0.037037
H_E=2

π_F=5/108≈0.046296
H_F≈2.32193

π_M=1/18≈0.055556
H_M≈2.58496

So let's compute each term:

Term C: (1/36)*1.58496 ≈ (0.027778)(1.58496) ≈0.04397

Term E: (1/27)*2 ≈(0.037037)*2≈0.074074

Term F: (5/108)*2.32193 ≈(0.046296)*2.32193≈0.107526

Term M: (1/18)*2.58496≈(0.055556)*2.58496≈0.14358

Now sum them up:

0.04397 +0.074074 ≈0.118044

+0.107526≈0.22557

+0.14358≈0.36915

Wait, that gives H≈0.36915 bits. That seems too low. But wait, I might have made a mistake here.

Wait a second, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the π_i values. Because earlier, I considered π_i as the stationary distribution per room, but when calculating H, I should be considering the expected entropy per step, which is the sum over all rooms i of π_i * H_i, where H_i is the entropy of the transitions from room i.

But in the way I calculated π_i, each π_i is for a single room. So for example, there are 8 corner rooms, each with π_C =1/36. So the total contribution from all corner rooms is 8*(1/36)*H_C.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in the way I calculated the π_i for each room. Let me clarify.

Wait, the stationary distribution π is a vector where each element π_i is the stationary probability for room i. So for each room, π_i = degree(i)/108.

So for a corner room, π_i=3/108=1/36. There are 8 such rooms.

So when calculating the total entropy rate, it's sum_{i=1 to 27} π_i * H_i.

Which can be grouped as:

Sum = 8*(1/36)*H_C +12*(4/108)*H_E +6*(5/108)*H_F +1*(6/108)*H_M.

Wait, because for each room type, the number of rooms is as follows:

- 8 corners, each with degree 3, so π_i=3/108=1/36.
- 12 edges, each with degree 4, so π_i=4/108=1/27.
- 6 face centers, each with degree 5, so π_i=5/108.
- 1 center, with degree 6, so π_i=6/108=1/18.

So the Sum becomes:

Sum = 8*(1/36)*H_C + 12*(1/27)*H_E +6*(5/108)*H_F +1*(1/18)*H_M.

Wait, let me compute each term again.

Compute each term:

Term C: 8*(1/36)*H_C = (8/36)*1.58496 ≈ (0.22222)*1.58496 ≈0.3534.

Term E:12*(1/27)*H_E = (12/27)*2 ≈ (0.44444)*2≈0.88888.

Term F:6*(5/108)*H_F = (30/108)*2.32193≈(0.27778)*2.32193≈0.6469.

Term M:1*(1/18)*H_M = (1/18)*2.58496≈0.05556*2.58496≈0.14358.

Now sum these terms:

0.3534 +0.88888≈1.24228

+0.6469≈1.88918

+0.14358≈2.03276.

So the entropy rate H≈2.03276 bits.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.03, which matches this calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Term C: 8*(1/36)=8/36=2/9≈0.2222. H_C=1.58496. So 0.2222*1.58496≈0.3534.

Term E:12*(1/27)=12/27=4/9≈0.4444. H_E=2. So 0.4444*2≈0.8888.

Term F:6*(5/108)=30/108=5/18≈0.2778. H_F=2.32193. So 0.2778*2.32193≈0.6469.

Term M:1*(1/18)=1/18≈0.0556. H_M=2.58496. So 0.0556*2.58496≈0.1436.

Adding them up: 0.3534 +0.8888=1.2422; +0.6469=1.8891; +0.1436≈2.0327.

Yes, that looks correct. So the entropy rate is approximately 2.03 bits, which corresponds to option B.
</think>

The entropy rate is calculated by considering the stationary distribution of the Markov chain and the entropy of the transition probabilities from each state. The stationary distribution is proportional to the number of exits (degree) of each room. After computing the entropy for each room type and weighting them by their stationary probabilities, the entropy rate is approximately 2.03 bits.
