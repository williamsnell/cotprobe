Question:

The procedure below is intended to display the index in a list of unique names (nameList) where a particular name (targetName) is found. lf targetName is not found in nameList, the code should display 0.
 PROCEDURE FindName (nameList, targetName)
 {
  index ← 0
  FOR EACH name IN nameList
  {
   index ← index + 1
   IF (name = targetName)
   {
   foundIndex ← index
   }
   ELSE
   {
   foundIndex ← 0
   }
  }
  DISPLAY (foundIndex)
 }
 Which of the following procedure calls can be used to demonstrate that the procedure does NOT Work as intended?

Options:

A: FindName (["Andrea", "Ben", "Chris", "Diane", "Eva", "Frank", "Grace", "Hannah", "Igor"], "Igor" )
B: FindName (["Andrea", "Ben", "Chris", "Diane"], "Diane" )
C: FindName (["Andrea", "Ben", "Chris", "Diane", "Eva", "Frank"], "Frank" )
D: FindName (["Andrea", "Ben"], "Ben" )
E: FindName (["Andrea", "Chris", "Diane"], "Ben")
F: FindName (["Andrea", "Ben" ], "Diane" )
G: FindName (["Andrea", "Ben", "Chris"], "Ben")
H: FindName (["Andrea", "Ben", "Chris", "Diane", "Eva"], "Eva" )
I: FindName (["Andrea", "Ben", "Chris", "Diane", "Eva", "Frank", "Grace", "Hannah"], "Hannah" )
J: FindName (["Andrea", "Ben", "Chris", "Diane", "Eva", "Frank", "Grace"], "Grace" )

Okay, I need to figure out which procedure call demonstrates that the FindName procedure doesn't work as intended. Let's read the problem carefully.

The procedure is supposed to display the index where targetName is found in nameList. If not found, display 0. But looking at the code, I can see potential issues.

Let me walk through the code step by step. The index starts at 0. Then, for each name in nameList, index increments by 1. So the first name is index 1, second 2, etc.

Wait, but if the list is 0-indexed in the code? Let me see. No, in the code, index starts at 0, then for each name, it's incremented. So the first element is index 1. That might be the first problem because usually, lists are 0-indexed, but maybe that's not the main issue here.

The code sets foundIndex to index when the name matches, else sets it to 0. But wait, every time the name doesn't match, it resets foundIndex to 0. That's a problem because if the target is somewhere in the middle, any names after it would reset foundIndex, potentially.

Wait, let's think about how the code works. Suppose the list is ["A", "B", "C"], target is "B".

Loop starts:
1st iteration: name is "A", index 1. Not equal to "B", so foundIndex becomes 0.
2nd iteration: name is "B", index 2. Equal, foundIndex is 2.
3rd iteration: name is "C", index 3. Not equal, foundIndex 0.

At the end, foundIndex is 0. But the correct index should be 2. So the procedure would output 0, which is wrong.

So the problem is that any names after the target will reset foundIndex to 0 if they don't match. That's a flaw.

Now, looking at the options, which one would show this issue. The procedure should return the correct index, but in some cases, it returns 0 even when the target is present.

Looking at the options, let's see each case:

A: ["Andrea", "Ben", "Chris", "Diane", "Eva", "Frank", "Grace", "Hannah", "Igor"], "Igor"

Igor is the last element. So index would go up to 9 (assuming index starts at 0, but in the code it's starting at 0 and increments for each name). Wait, the code initializes index to 0, then for each name, increments index by 1. So for a list of 9 names (indices 0-8), the index would go up to 9. Wait, no. Let's think: for each name in 9-element list, index starts at 0, then after each name, increases by 1. So for the first name, index becomes 1, then 2, up to 9 when the last name is processed.

In this case, the last name is Igor. So during the 9th iteration, index is 9. Since name equals target, foundIndex is set to 9. But after that, there are no more names. So the foundIndex is 9, which is correct. So this case would work as intended, so it's not the answer.

B: ["Andrea", "Ben", "Chris", "Diane"], "Diane"

Diane is the last element. Let's see:

index starts at 0.

1st name: Andrea, index 1. Not target, foundIndex 0.

2nd: Ben, index 2. Not target, foundIndex 0.

3rd: Chris, index 3. Not target, foundIndex 0.

4th: Diane, index 4. Target found, foundIndex 4.

No more names. So output is 4, correct. So this works, not the problem.

C: ["Andrea", "Ben", "Chris", "Diane", "Eva", "Frank"], "Frank"

Frank is the last name. So during 6th iteration, index is 6. FoundIndex becomes 6. Output 6, correct. So this works.

D: ["Andrea", "Ben"], "Ben"

Ben is the second name. Let's see:

1st: Andrea, index 1. Not Ben, foundIndex 0.

2nd: Ben, index 2. Found, foundIndex 2.

Output is 2. But the correct index (if it's 0-based) would be 1. Wait, wait: the problem says "the index in the list". But in the code, the index is 1-based. So if the problem expects 0-based, that's a problem. But the question says the procedure is intended to display the index, but the code seems to use 1-based indexing. So when the target is found, it returns the 1-based index. So for ["Andrea", "Ben"], the index for Ben is 2. But the question says that if not found, display 0. So for this case, the code works correctly as per its own logic, but if the intended index is 0-based, it's off. But the question is about the procedure not working as intended, and the problem is with the code's logic, not the index type.

Wait, but in the code, if the target is found, it sets foundIndex to index, which is the current 1-based position. So for Ben in a 2-element list, it returns 2. So the procedure is correctly returning that, so this isn't the case where it fails.

E: ["Andrea", "Chris", "Diane"], "Ben"

Target not in list. So during each iteration, foundIndex is set to 0. After all iterations, foundIndex is 0. So the output is 0, which is correct. So this works as intended.

F: ["Andrea", "Ben"], "Diane"

Target not in list. So foundIndex remains 0. So correct.

G: ["Andrea", "Ben", "Chris"], "Ben"

Ben is second element.

1st: Andrea, index 1. Not Ben, foundIndex 0.

2nd: Ben, index 2. Found, foundIndex 2.

3rd: Chris, index 3. Not Ben, foundIndex 0.

At the end, foundIndex is 0. So the output is 0, which is wrong because Ben is at index 2 (1-based) or 1 (0-based). So in this case, the procedure doesn't work as intended because it returns 0 even though Ben is present.

Wait, so the code's problem is that after finding the target, any subsequent names will reset foundIndex to 0 if they don't match. So in this case, after finding Ben at index 2, the loop continues to the next name, Chris, which doesn't match, so foundIndex is set to 0. So the final foundIndex is 0, which is incorrect.

So this case (option G) would demonstrate the procedure doesn't work correctly.

H: ["Andrea", "Ben", "Chris", "Diane", "Eva"], "Eva"

Eva is the last element. So during 5th iteration, index is 5. Found, foundIndex 5. No more names, so output is 5, correct.

I: ["Andrea", "Ben", "Chris", "Diane", "Eva", "Frank", "Grace", "Hannah"], "Hannah"

Hannah is the 8th element. So during 8th iteration, index is 8. Found. Then, no more names. So output 8, correct.

J: ["Andrea", "Ben", "Chris", "Diane", "Eva", "Frank", "Grace"], "Grace"

Grace is the 7th element. Found, index 7. Correct.

So the only case where the procedure fails is option G, where the target is found but the loop continues after, resetting foundIndex to 0.
</think>

The procedure `FindName` is intended to display the index of a target name in a list, returning 0 if the name is not found. However, the code has a flaw: after finding the target name, any subsequent names in the list will reset `foundIndex` to 0 if they do not match the target. This causes the procedure to fail when the target is followed by other names.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: The target is the last name, so the procedure works correctly.
- **B**: The target is the last name, so the procedure works correctly.
- **C**: The target is the last name, so the procedure works correctly.
- **D**: The target is found, and the procedure returns the correct index.
- **E**: The target is not in the list, so the procedure correctly returns 0.
- **F**: The target is not in the list, so the procedure correctly returns 0.
- **G**: The target is found, but the loop continues to the next name, resetting `foundIndex` to 0. This demonstrates the procedure's flaw.
- **H**: The target is the last name, so the procedure works correctly.
- **I**: The target is the last name, so the procedure works correctly.
- **J**: The target is the last name, so the procedure works correctly.

Thus, **option G** demonstrates that the procedure does not work as intended.

**Answer: G**
