Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about remarriages, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me break it down step by step.

The question is: "Remarriages are..." and there are several options from A to J. I'll go through each option one by one, but first, I should probably understand what the question is asking. It's about the general nature of remarriages, so I'm thinking about statistics, societal norms, and common beliefs regarding remarriage rates and success.

Let me start by recalling what I know. From what I remember, in many cultures, the likelihood of someone remarrying can vary, but generally, there might be some patterns. For instance, I think that in some societies, men might remarry more often than women, or vice versa. Also, I've heard that people who have been married before might have different rates of remarriage compared to those who have never been married.

Looking at the options:

A: More frequent for men than women. I think this might be true because men, especially in some cultures, might remarry more quickly after a divorce or widowhood. But I'm not entirely sure if this is a universal trend.

B: Illegal in most countries. That doesn't sound right. I know that in many places, remarriage is allowed after a certain period, especially after a divorce. So B is probably incorrect.

C: Most common among those who have never been married before. Hmm, that seems counterintuitive. I would think that those who have been married once would be more likely to remarry, not those who've never married. So C might not be correct.

D: Typically more successful. I've heard that second marriages have a higher chance of succeeding than first marriages, but I'm not certain. Wait, no, actually, I think first marriages are more likely to succeed. So D might not be right.

E: Always unsuccessful. No, that's too extreme. Some second marriages work well, so E is incorrect.

F: Always successful. Also too absolute. Not all second marriages are successful, so F is out.

G: More frequent for women than men. I'm not sure about this. In some cultures, maybe women remarry less because of societal expectations or economic factors. But I'm not certain.

H: Typically less successful. I think this might be correct. I've heard that second marriages have a higher divorce rate than first marriages. So H could be the answer.

I: Only allowed after a certain period of time. That depends on the country and the circumstances. For example, after a divorce, some places require a waiting period, but others don't. So I don't think this is universally true, making I incorrect.

J: Most common among those who have been married multiple times before. That doesn't sound right. I would think that people who have been married once are more likely to remarry than those who have never married, but J is about multiple times, which seems less common.

So, considering all this, H seems the most plausible. Remarriages are typically less successful than first marriages. I think that's a common statistic I've heard before, so I'll go with H.
