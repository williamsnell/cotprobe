Alright, so I've got this question about the Federal Reserve and how it increases the money supply. Let me try to think through this step by step. Okay, the question is asking which of the options is a tool the Fed uses to increase the money supply.

First, I remember that the Fed has a few main tools at its disposal. The big ones are usually the discount rate, reserve requirements, and open market operations. Those are the primary methods they use to control the money supply and interest rates.

Looking at the options one by one:

Option A: Decreasing government spending. Wait, isn't that more of a fiscal policy tool? The Fed doesn't control government spending directly. So I think A is probably not the right answer.

Option B: A lower discount rate. Hmm, the discount rate is the interest rate the Fed charges banks for loans. If they lower this rate, it becomes cheaper for banks to borrow money. That should encourage banks to borrow more, which in turn can increase the money they lend out, thus expanding the money supply. So B seems like a possible correct answer.

Option C: A higher corporate tax rate. That sounds like a tax policy, which is again fiscal policy, not monetary. The Fed doesn't set tax rates, so C is likely not the answer.

Option D: Selling foreign exchange reserves. Selling forex would affect the currency's value, but I'm not sure if that's a primary tool for increasing the money supply. Maybe it's more about exchange rates than directly injecting money into the system. So probably not D.

Option E: Selling Treasury securities to commercial banks. Wait, selling Treasuries would actually reduce the money supply because the Fed is taking money out of the banking system. That's the opposite of what we want, so E is incorrect.

Option F: Decreasing the minimum wage. That's a labor policy, not related to the Fed's tools. So F is out.

Option G: Selling government bonds to the public. Selling bonds to the public would mean the government is borrowing more, which is fiscal policy. The Fed might buy or sell bonds, but selling them would reduce the money supply, so G is not the right choice.

Option H: Increasing interest rates. If the Fed increases rates, borrowing becomes more expensive, which would slow down spending and investment. That would decrease the money supply, so H is wrong.

Option I: A lower personal income tax rate. Again, that's fiscal policy. The Fed doesn't set personal income tax rates, so I is not the answer.

Option J: A higher reserve ratio. The reserve ratio is the amount banks must hold in reserves. If the Fed increases this, banks have less money to lend out, which decreases the money supply. So J is the opposite of what we want.

So, going back, the correct tool must be B: A lower discount rate. Because lowering the discount rate makes it cheaper for banks to borrow from the Fed, leading them to borrow more, which they can then lend out, increasing the money supply.

The correct answer is **B: A lower discount rate**. This is because when the Fed lowers the discount rate, it becomes cheaper for banks to borrow money, encouraging them to borrow more and subsequently lend out more, which increases the money supply.

Answer: B
