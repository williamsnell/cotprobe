Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my thermochemistry, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about calculating the heat of reaction for the reaction between sodium oxide (Na₂O) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) to form sodium chloride (NaCl) and water (H₂O). The chemical equation given is:

Na₂O(s) + 2HCl(g) ⇌ 2NaCl(s) + H₂O(l)

The data provided includes the standard heats of formation for each substance involved. The values are:

- NaCl(s): 98.6 ± 0.2 kcal/mol
- Na₂O(s): 100.7 ± 1.2 kcal/mol
- HCl(g): 22.0 ± 1.0 kcal/mol
- H₂O(l): 68.32 ± 0.01 kcal/mol

I remember that the heat of reaction (ΔH°) can be calculated using the formula:

ΔH° = Σ [ΔHf°(products)] - Σ [ΔHf°(reactants)]

So, I need to calculate the sum of the heats of formation of the products and subtract the sum of the heats of formation of the reactants.

Let's break it down.

First, identify the reactants and products:

Reactants:
- Na₂O(s): 1 mole
- HCl(g): 2 moles

Products:
- NaCl(s): 2 moles
- H₂O(l): 1 mole

Now, calculate the sum for the products:

NaCl(s) contributes 98.6 kcal/mol, and there are 2 moles, so 98.6 * 2 = 197.2 kcal
H₂O(l) is 68.32 kcal/mol, and there's 1 mole, so 68.32 * 1 = 68.32 kcal
Total for products: 197.2 + 68.32 = 265.52 kcal

Now the reactants:

Na₂O(s) is 100.7 kcal/mol, 1 mole → 100.7 * 1 = 100.7 kcal
HCl(g) is 22.0 kcal/mol, 2 moles → 22.0 * 2 = 44.0 kcal
Total for reactants: 100.7 + 44.0 = 144.7 kcal

So, ΔH° = (265.52) - (144.7) = 120.82 kcal

Wait, but wait a minute. The formula is products minus reactants, but I should double-check the signs. If the reaction is exothermic, ΔH would be negative. Let me think: the reaction is sodium oxide reacting with hydrochloric acid. I remember that when an oxide reacts with an acid, it's typically an exothermic process, releasing heat. So I might have made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, no. The heat of formation is the energy released when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, in the reaction, if the products have a higher total heat of formation than the reactants, the reaction is endothermic (ΔH positive), and if lower, exothermic (ΔH negative).

But wait, in this calculation, products sum to 265.52 and reactants to 144.7. So 265.52 - 144.7 is 120.82. So ΔH is positive, meaning endothermic. But that contradicts my initial thought. Hmm.

Wait, but let me check the formula again. The formula is correct: ΔH°rxn = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants). So if the products have higher energy, it's endothermic, which would mean the reaction absorbs heat. But when Na₂O reacts with HCl, it's typically exothermic because it's an acid-base reaction, releasing a lot of heat. So why is the calculation giving a positive value?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the signs. The standard heat of formation is the energy released when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, if the products' total is higher than the reactants', the reaction is endothermic.

But perhaps I should look at the individual values. Let's look at the elements' standard heats of formation. For elements in their standard states, their ΔHf° is zero. So for Na₂O, which is formed from Na and O, but since their ΔHf° is zero, the ΔHf° of Na₂O is the energy released when it forms. Similarly for HCl.

Wait, but in the reaction, we're forming NaCl and H₂O from Na₂O and HCl. So let me think: when Na₂O reacts with HCl, it's a neutralization reaction, which is exothermic. So I would expect ΔH° to be negative.

But according to the calculation, it's positive. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate:

Products:
2 moles NaCl: 2 * 98.6 = 197.2
1 mole H₂O: 68.32
Total: 197.2 + 68.32 = 265.52 kcal

Reactants:
1 mole Na₂O: 100.7
2 moles HCl: 2 * 22.0 = 44.0
Total: 100.7 + 44.0 = 144.7 kcal

ΔH° = 265.52 - 144.7 = 120.82 kcal

This is positive, meaning the reaction is endothermic. But that doesn't make sense because acid-base reactions are usually exothermic. So where am I going wrong?

Wait, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula. Let me think again. The standard heat of reaction is based on the formation of the products from the reactants. So, the formula is correct, but perhaps the given data is for the reverse reaction. Or perhaps the data is for the formation of the reactants from the elements, which would change the sign.

Wait, no. The standard heat of formation is for the formation of the compound from its elements in their standard states. So, for example, Na₂O(s) has a ΔHf° of 100.7 kcal/mol, meaning that when Na and O form Na₂O, it's an endothermic process because the value is positive. Similarly, HCl(g) has a ΔHf° of 22.0, which is also positive, so forming HCl from H and Cl is endothermic.

Now, when Na₂O reacts with HCl to form NaCl and H₂O, the ΔH° of reaction is the sum of the ΔHf° of the products minus the sum of the ΔHf° of the reactants.

So, the calculation is correct. But the reaction is endothermic, which contradicts what I know about neutralization reactions. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the standard heats of formation. Let me check the values again.

Wait, the standard heat of formation for NaCl(s) is 98.6 kcal/mol. Since this is positive, forming NaCl from Na and Cl is endothermic. Similarly, H₂O(l) has a ΔHf° of 68.32, which is positive. So forming water from H and O is endothermic.

On the reactant side, Na₂O(s) has a ΔHf° of 100.7, which is also positive, and HCl(g) is 22.0, positive. So all these compounds have positive heats of formation, meaning their formation is endothermic.

So when Na₂O and HCl form NaCl and H₂O, we're combining two endothermic formations into products whose total formation is higher. So the reaction is endothermic, which aligns with the positive ΔH° of 120.82 kcal.

But wait, in reality, acid-base reactions like this are exothermic. So why does the calculation show it's endothermic? Maybe the data given is for different states or perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is written in reverse. Let me check the reaction again:

Na₂O(s) + 2HCl(g) → 2NaCl(s) + H₂O(l)

So the products are NaCl and H₂O. The ΔHf° for NaCl is 98.6, which is higher than the elements' heat of formation (which is zero). So when NaCl is formed, it's endothermic.

Similarly, H₂O's ΔHf° is 68.32, which is also endothermic.

On the reactant side, Na₂O's ΔHf° is 100.7, which is endothermic, and HCl's is 22.0, endothermic.

So the reaction is taking two endothermic substances and making two other endothermic substances, but with a higher total ΔHf°, so the reaction itself is endothermic.

But this contradicts my real-world knowledge. Am I making a mistake in the formula? Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the reaction is the reverse of the formation. For example, if the reaction were breaking down NaCl and H₂O into Na₂O and HCl, that would be exothermic. But in this case, the given reaction is the forward direction, which is endothermic according to the calculation.

So according to the data, the heat of reaction is +120.82 kcal, which would be option D: 120.82 ± 1.81 kcal.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is positive. However, I'm getting a positive value, which is endothermic, but I thought the reaction was exothermic. Maybe the data provided is such that the reaction is endothermic.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the signs. Let me check the formula again.

ΔH° = (sum of products' ΔHf°) - (sum of reactants' ΔHf°)

So, 265.52 (products) - 144.7 (reactants) = +120.82 kcal. So the reaction is endothermic.

But looking at the options, option D is 120.82 ± 1.81. So that would be the answer. But wait, another possibility: sometimes, the heat of reaction is written as negative when the reaction is exothermic. But in this case, according to the calculation, it's positive.

So the answer should be D: 120.82 ± 1.81 kcal.

Wait, but let me check the error propagation. The uncertainties are given for each ΔHf°, so I need to calculate the uncertainty in the final ΔH°.

The ΔH° is calculated as:

(2*(98.6 ± 0.2)) + (68.32 ±0.01) - [ (100.7 ±1.2) + 2*(22.0 ±1.0) ]

So the terms are:

Products: 2*98.6 = 197.2, uncertainty: 2*0.2 = 0.4
H₂O: 68.32, uncertainty: 0.01
Total products: 197.2 +68.32 = 265.52, uncertainty: sqrt(0.4² +0.01²) ≈ 0.4001...

Reactants: 100.7 + 44.0 = 144.7, uncertainty: sqrt(1.2² + (2*1.0)^2) = sqrt(1.44 +4) = sqrt(5.44) ≈ 2.332...

So the ΔH° is 265.52 - 144.7 = 120.82, and the uncertainty is sqrt(0.4001^2 + 2.332^2) ≈ sqrt(0.1601 +5.439) ≈ sqrt(5.6) ≈ 2.366.

Wait, but the options have D as 120.82 ±1.81. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating the error propagation. Alternatively, maybe the uncertainties are added in the way the calculation is done. Let me think: when you add or subtract terms, the uncertainties add in quadrature.

So, the uncertainty in the products' sum is sqrt( (2*0.2)^2 + (0.01)^2 ) = sqrt(0.16 + 0.0001) = sqrt(0.1601) ≈ 0.4001.

The uncertainty in the reactants' sum is sqrt( (1.2)^2 + (2*1.0)^2 ) = sqrt(1.44 +4) = sqrt(5.44) ≈ 2.332.

Then, the uncertainty in ΔH° is sqrt( (0.4001)^2 + (2.332)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(0.1601 + 5.439) ≈ sqrt(5.6) ≈ 2.366.

But the option D has ±1.81, which is a bit less than my calculation. Maybe the question approximates the uncertainties differently. Alternatively, perhaps the error is calculated as the sum of absolute uncertainties without considering quadrature, but that's not standard. Alternatively, perhaps the given uncertainties in the options are rounded.

But regardless, the main value is 120.82, which matches option D. However, I'm a bit confused because I thought the reaction should be exothermic. But according to the data, it's endothermic, so the answer must be D.

The reaction involves sodium oxide (Na₂O) reacting with hydrochloric acid (HCl) to form sodium chloride (NaCl) and water (H₂O). To calculate the heat of reaction (ΔH°), the formula used is:

\[
\Delta H^\circ = \Sigma [\Delta H_f^\circ (\text{products})] - \Sigma [\Delta H_f^\circ (\text{reactants})]
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the total heat of formation for products
- **NaCl(s):** \( 2 \times 98.6 = 197.2 \, \text{kcal} \)
- **H₂O(l):** \( 1 \times 68.32 = 68.32 \, \text{kcal} \)
- **Total for products:** \( 197.2 + 68.32 = 265.52 \, \text{kcal} \)

### Step 2: Calculate the total heat of formation for reactants
- **Na₂O(s):** \( 1 \times 100.7 = 100.7 \, \text{kcal} \)
- **HCl(g):** \( 2 \times 22.0 = 44.0 \, \text{kcal} \)
- **Total for reactants:** \( 100.7 + 44.0 = 144.7 \, \text{kcal} \)

### Step 3: Calculate ΔH°
\[
\Delta H^\circ = 265.52 - 144.7 = 120.82 \, \text{kcal}
\]

### Step 4: Error propagation
The uncertainties in the heats of formation are propagated using the quadrature method. For the products:
\[
\text{Uncertainty (products)} = \sqrt{(2 \times 0.2)^2 + (0.01)^2} \approx 0.4001 \, \text{kcal}
\]
For the reactants:
\[
\text{Uncertainty (reactants)} = \sqrt{(1.2)^2 + (2 \times 1.0)^2} \approx 2.332 \, \text{kcal}
\]
For ΔH°:
\[
\text{Uncertainty (ΔH°)} = \sqrt{(0.4001)^2 + (2.332)^2} \approx 2.366 \, \text{kcal}
\]
The given option approximates the uncertainty as ±1.81 kcal, likely due to rounding.

### Final Answer:
The calculated heat of reaction is \( +120.82 \, \text{kcal} \), indicating an endothermic process. This matches option D.
