Okay, so I have this question where I need to find the determinant of a 2x2 matrix A. The matrix is given as:

A = |2 3|
        |1 2|

Hmm, I remember that the determinant of a 2x2 matrix is calculated using a specific formula. Let me think... Oh right! For a matrix:

|a b|
|c d|

the determinant is ad minus bc. So, I just need to multiply the top left by the bottom right and subtract the product of the top right and bottom left.

Let me apply that to matrix A. So, a is 2, b is 3, c is 1, and d is 2. 

First, I'll calculate ad: that's 2 * 2, which equals 4. Next, I'll calculate bc: that's 3 * 1, which is 3. 

Now, subtract bc from ad: 4 - 3 equals 1. Wait, but I should double-check my multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 2 times 2 is definitely 4, and 3 times 1 is 3. So yes, 4 minus 3 is indeed 1.

Looking at the options provided, G is 1. So that should be the correct answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up any signs. The formula is ad - bc, so positive a*d minus positive b*c. Since all the numbers here are positive, the result should be positive. Yeah, that's right. So the determinant is 1.

The determinant of matrix A is calculated as (2×2) - (3×1) = 4 - 3 = 1.
