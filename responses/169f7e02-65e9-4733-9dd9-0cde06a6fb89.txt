Okay, so I've got this problem here about computing the diameter of a square link under compressive load. Hmm, let's see. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my mechanics, but I'll do my best.

The problem states that the compressive load is 27,000 lbs. The modulus of elasticity is given as 30 × 10^6 psi. The proportionality limit is 38,000 psi, and the working stress is 7000 psi. The length of the link is 55 inches. I need to find the diameter from the given options, which are all square sizes, so I guess the diameter here refers to the side length of the square link.

Wait, wait, no, actually, wait. When they say diameter of a square link, that's a bit confusing. Oh, right, in the context of a square link, the diameter probably refers to the diagonal measurement, but wait, no, maybe they mean the side length. Hmm. Or perhaps the diameter is the width of the link, which is square, so maybe it's the side length. I'll have to clarify that as I go.

So, the problem involves stress and strain under compressive load. I remember that stress is force per unit area, and strain is the change in dimension over original dimension. The modulus of elasticity (E) relates stress and strain via Hooke's Law: E = stress / strain.

But wait, the problem gives the modulus of elasticity as 30×10^6 psi. The proportionality limit is 38,000 psi, which is the maximum stress that the material can withstand without plastic deformation. Since the working stress is 7000 psi, which is below the proportionality limit, we can use linear elasticity up to that point.

Wait, but the compressive load is 27,000 lbs. So, the stress in the link will be the force divided by the area. The stress can't exceed the working stress of 7000 psi, I think. Because if it does, it might cause failure or exceed the allowable limit.

So the approach is probably to calculate the required area based on the maximum allowable stress and the applied load, then find the side length (diameter) of the square that gives that area.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the required stress using the working stress, which is 7000 psi.
2. The compressive load is given, so force F = 27,000 lbs.
3. Stress (σ) = Force (F) / Area (A). Rearranged, Area A = F / σ.
4. Compute the area using F=27,000 lbs and σ=7000 psi.
5. Then, since the link is square, area A = side^2, so side = sqrt(A).
6. Compare this side length with the options given.

Wait, but wait a second. The modulus of elasticity is given, but I'm not sure if it's needed here because we're just calculating based on stress and area. Maybe if the problem had something to do with deflection or something involving the modulus, but I don't think so in this case. Because the question is only about the diameter (side length) to handle the load within the working stress.

So let's proceed.

Compute area A = F / σ = 27,000 lbs / 7000 psi.

Let me calculate that: 27,000 divided by 7,000 is 3.857... approximately 3.857 square inches.

So the area of the square link is 3.857 in². Since it's a square, the side length (s) is sqrt(3.857). Let me compute that.

sqrt(3.857) is approximately 1.964 inches. So the side length is approximately 1.96 inches.

Looking at the options, option C is 1.96 in. × 1.96 in. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I miss anything? For example, does the length of the link (55 inches) affect the calculation? I don't think so because the area calculation depends on the cross-sectional area, not the length, when dealing with axial stress. So, the length here is probably a distractor or maybe for a different part of the problem, but not needed for this particular calculation.

Another thing: the modulus of elasticity is given, but since we're only considering stress and area, and the modulus is higher than the proportionality limit, which isn't exceeded here, I think it's not needed. So the approach is correct.

So the answer should be option C: 1.96 in. × 1.96 in.
</think>

To compute the diameter of the square link, we calculate the required area based on the working stress and the applied load. The area is found to be approximately 3.857 in², leading to a side length of about 1.96 inches. This matches option C.

C: 1.96 in. × 1.96 in.
