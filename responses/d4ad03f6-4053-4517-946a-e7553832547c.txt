Okay, so I need to figure out which branch of the military astronaut John Glenn served in before becoming an astronaut. Let's start by recalling what I know about John Glenn. He was a famous astronaut, one of the original Mercury Seven. I remember he was the first American to orbit the Earth, right? That was in 1962 with his flight on Friendship 7.

But before that, he was a military pilot. I think he was in the Marines because I've heard the term "Marine pilot" before. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Let me think more carefully. The military branches include the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, etc. 

I know that the Air Force is a separate branch, but sometimes people confuse it with the Army or Navy. John Glenn was a fighter pilot, so maybe the Marines? Because the Marines have their own aviation branch. Alternatively, could it be the Navy? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the Mercury Seven astronauts were all selected from the military, mostly from the Navy and Air Force. But John Glenn was a Marine. I think that's correct. So looking at the options, option C is Marines. Let me double-check. Yes, John Glenn served in the U.S. Marine Corps, reaching the rank of colonel. So the answer should be C: Marines.
