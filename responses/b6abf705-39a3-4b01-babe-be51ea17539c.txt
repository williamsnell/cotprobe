Question:

A resident in an exclusive residential area is a marine biologist. To aid in his study of sharks, he had a large tank built in his backyard in which he placed a great white shark. Aside from a smell that emanated from the tank, some neighbors were concerned and afraid to let their children outside for fear that they would wander onto the resident's property. In order to convince his neighbors that they had nothing to fear, the resident invited them over to view the shark tank. While a neighbor was standing near the tank, the shark splashed its tail, and the neighbor got very wet. The neighbor, who had a cold, developed bronchitis. If the neighbor sues the resident for damages incurred from being drenched by the shark and bases her suit on strict liability, she will most likely

Options:

A: not recover, because she suffered injury only because she had a cold and, therefore, was unusually vulnerable to harm from being splashed with water.
B: not recover, because the resident had taken all necessary precautions to ensure the shark could not harm anyone.
C: recover, because the resident intentionally placed the shark in an area where it could potentially harm others.
D: not recover, because the development of bronchitis was not a direct result of the resident's actions.
E: recover, because the possessor of wild animals is strictly liable for all injuries caused to others by the animals.
F: not recover, because she willingly chose to visit the resident's property and view the shark tank.
G: not recover, because she did not suffer the type of harm normally inflicted by a shark.
H: recover, because the smell from the shark tank was a nuisance.
I: recover, because the resident knowingly kept a dangerous wild animal in a residential area.
J: recover, because the resident failed to warn her of the potential risk of being splashed by the shark.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this law question. Let me read it carefully. 

There's a marine biologist who lives in an exclusive area. He built a big tank in his backyard with a great white shark. Some neighbors were worried because of a smell and because they feared their kids might wander onto his property. To reassure them, he invited them over to see the tank. While a neighbor was near the tank, the shark splashed its tail, and she got wet. She had a cold and developed bronchitis. Now she's suing the resident for strict liability.

The question is about whether she'll recover damages. The options are A through J.

First, I need to remember what strict liability is. From what I recall, strict liability applies when someone keeps a wild animal, and the owner can be held liable for any injuries caused by the animal, regardless of whether they were negligent or took precautions.

In this case, the resident is keeping a great white shark, which is definitely a wild animal. So, under strict liability, if the shark caused harm, the resident might be liable.

But wait, the harm here was the neighbor getting splashed by the shark's tail. She was wet, and because she had a cold, she developed bronchitis. So, the question is whether the splashing caused her injury, which led to bronchitis.

Looking at the options:

Option E says the possessor is strictly liable for all injuries caused by the animals. That seems to align with strict liability for wild animals. So, if the shark's action (splashing) caused her to get wet, and that led to her bronchitis, then E might be correct.

But let me check other options to be sure.

Option A says she only got sick because she had a cold, making her unusually vulnerable. I think in tort law, if the defendant's action was the cause in fact, even if the plaintiff was more susceptible, that doesn't bar recovery. So A might not be a valid reason to not recover.

Option B suggests the resident took all precautions. But strict liability doesn't require negligence; even if precautions were taken, liability still applies. So B is incorrect.

Option C says the resident intentionally placed the shark where it could harm others. That might touch on negligence if he placed it negligently, but the question is about strict liability, so C's reasoning might not apply here.

Option D says bronchitis wasn't a direct result. But the splash led to her getting wet, which made her sick. It's a chain of events. So D might be incorrect because the cause was the splash leading to her condition.

Option F says she willingly visited, so assumed the risk. But strict liability doesn't require assumption of risk. Even if she voluntarily came, the owner is still liable. So F is incorrect.

Option G says she didn't suffer the type of harm a shark usually inflicts. But the harm here was the splash leading to injury, which is a direct result of the shark's actions, even if not a bite. So G is incorrect.

Option H talks about the smell being a nuisance. That's a different claim, probably nuisance, but the issue here is about strict liability for the shark's action, so H is not the main point.

Option I says he knowingly kept a dangerous animal. That's part of the strict liability doctrineâ€”knowing possession might be a factor, but the main point is strict liability regardless. So I could be a contender, but E is more directly about strict liability for all injuries.

Option J says he failed to warn her of the risk. That might relate to negligence, like failing to warn, but strict liability doesn't require a warning. So J is about negligence, not strict liability.

So, putting it together, the correct answer is E because the possessor of a wild animal is strictly liable for all injuries caused. The splashing caused her to get wet, leading to bronchitis, so she can recover under strict liability.

The correct answer is E: recover, because the possessor of wild animals is strictly liable for all injuries caused to others by the animals. 

In this case, the resident kept a great white shark, a wild animal, and the shark's actions (splashing) directly led to the neighbor's injury and subsequent bronchitis. Strict liability applies regardless of precautions taken, making E the correct choice.
