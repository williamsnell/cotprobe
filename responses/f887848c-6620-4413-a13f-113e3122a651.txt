Okay, so I have this question about translating the word "murtis." I'm not entirely sure what it means, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that in some religious contexts, especially in Hinduism, there are terms related to worship and idols. Murtis sounds familiar, maybe from that area. I think murtis refers to something used in worship. Could it be idols? Because I've heard of people using idols in their prayers or as objects of devotion.

Looking at the options, F is Idols. That seems possible. Let me go through the other options to make sure.

Option A: Sacrifices. That doesn't sound right. Sacrifices are more about offerings, but murtis isn't about that.

Option B: Blessings. No, that's more about the act of giving a blessing.

Option C: Offerings. Offerings could be part of worship, but murtis specifically refers to something else.

Option D: Prayers. Prayers are more about communication with a deity, not objects.

Option E: Apparitions. That's about seeing something spiritual, not objects used in worship.

Option F: Idols. This seems right because murtis are often idols in Hinduism used for worship.

Option G: Rituals. That's broader, not specific to murtis.

Option H: Scriptures. No, scriptures are religious texts.

Option I: Spirits. That's more about beings, not objects.

Option J: Symbols. While murtis can be symbolic, the primary meaning is as idols.

So, putting it all together, the best answer is F: Idols.
