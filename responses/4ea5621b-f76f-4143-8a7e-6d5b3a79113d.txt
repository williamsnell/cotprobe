Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"The substitution of Plato for the scholastic Aristotle was hastened by contact with Byzantine scholarship. Already at the Council of Ferrera (1438), which nominally reunited the Eastern and Western churches, there was a debate in which the Byzantines maintained the superiority of Plato to Aristotle. Cosimo and Lorenzo de Medici were both addicted to Plato; Cosimo founded and Lorenzo continued the Florentine Academy, which was largely devoted to the study of Plato&â€¦The humanists of the time, however, were too busy acquiring knowledge of antiquity to be able to produce anything of value."

Okay, so I need to figure out which philosophy the Medici family's schools favored based on the given text. Let's break down the information step by step.

The text mentions that Cosimo and Lorenzo de Medici were "addicted to Plato." That already hints towards a preference for Plato's philosophy. They founded and continued the Florentine Academy, which was "largely devoted to the study of Plato." So, the school was focused on Plato's ideas.

Furthermore, the text says that the substitution of Plato for scholastic Aristotle was hastened by contact with Byzantine scholarship. At the Council of Ferrera, the Byzantines argued for Plato's superiority over Aristotle. This suggests that there was a shift from Aristotle (Aristotelianism) to Plato, influenced by Byzantine ideas.

The humanists of the time were busy acquiring knowledge of antiquity but didn't produce much of value themselves. So, the focus was more on studying ancient philosophers, particularly Plato, rather than the scholastic Aristotle.

Looking at the options, the key term here is Neoplatonism. Neoplatonism is a school of thought that revives and interprets the ideas of Plato, often incorporating elements from later philosophical and mystical traditions. Since the Medici were into Plato and his study was central to their academy, Neoplatonism (option H) seems to be the correct answer.

Other options can be ruled out. Renaissance humanism (A) is broader and more about reviving classical learning, which they did, but the question specifically asks about the philosophy favored. Empiricism (B), Rationalism (J), Stoicism (E), Existentialism (G), and Neoclassicism (I) don't fit the context. Scholasticism (F) is the opposite, as they were moving away from Aristotle, who was a key figure in scholastic thought. Byzantinism (D) refers to the Byzantine Empire's culture but isn't a specific philosophy. Aristotelianism (C) is the opposite of what they favored.

The Medici family's schools favored Neoplatonism, as they emphasized the study of Plato and were influenced by Byzantine scholarship that highlighted Plato's superiority over Aristotle.
