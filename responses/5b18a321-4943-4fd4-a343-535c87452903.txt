Question:

A developer wished to build an apartment house in a local city. He raised $1 million from various sources to fund the project. After searching for a vacant lot that would be sufficient for development, the developer concluded that there was not a suitable vacant lot available. Reluctantly, the developer concluded that he would have to purchase a developed lot, have the existing structures removed, and then build the apartment house. The developer was reluctant to do this, because he had not budgeted for the additional cost of buying a developed property and removing the development. After a search for an appropriate parcel, the developer purchased a large lot, developed with a single-story residential home, for $200,000. He then spent $50,000 having the residential home removed from the lot. Knowing that it would cost approximately $850,000 to build the apartment house, the developer realized he would need to raise another $100,000. He approached an investor about lending him $100,000. The investor was apprehensive about the project because the developer had not yet lined up a construction firm to build the apartment house. As a result, the parties signed the following written agreement:"The investor promises to lend to the developer $100,000 at 5 percent interest within 30 days, provided the developer contracts with a construction company to build the apartment house for no more than $850,000. Loan to be repaid at the rate of $1,000 per month, starting one month after the completion of the apartment house. The loan is to be secured by a mortgage on the property. "The developer then contracted with a construction company to build the apartment for $800,000. After the contract was signed and construction had begun, the developer asked the investor when he would be receiving the $100,000 the investor promised to lend him. The investor replied, "I've changed my mind. I think this is too risky an investment. I'm not going to lend you the money. "In an appropriate action to secure specific performance of the investor's promise to lend him the $100,000, the developer will

Options:

A: win, because there is a memorandum that satisfies the Statute of Frauds.
B: win, because land is unique, making the legal remedy inadequate.
C: lose, because the developer's only remedy is for damages.
D: lose, because the developer cannot show detrimental reliance.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about specific performance in a contract. Let me start by breaking down the facts and the issue.

So, the developer wanted to build an apartment, raised $1 million but couldn't find a suitable vacant lot. He had to buy a developed lot with a single-story home for $200k, then spent another $50k to remove it. Then, he realized building the apartment would cost about $850k, so he approached an investor for $100k. The investor was worried because the developer hadn't lined up a construction company yet.

They signed a written agreement where the investor promises to lend $100k at 5% interest within 30 days, but only if the developer contracts with a construction company to build the apartment for no more than $850k. The loan would be repaid at $1k per month after completion, secured by a mortgage on the property.

The developer then contracted with a construction company for $800k, which is under the $850k limit. But after the contract was signed and construction started, the investor backed out, saying it's too risky and he won't lend the money.

Now, the developer is suing for specific performance, meaning he wants the investor to actually give him the $100k as promised. The question is whether he will win.

The options are A to D. Let's go through each.

Option A says he'll win because there's a memorandum satisfying the Statute of Frauds. The Statute of Frauds requires certain contracts to be in writing to be enforceable, especially loans. Since they have a written agreement, this might satisfy that. But specific performance isn't just about the Statute of Frauds; it's more about whether the remedy is appropriate.

Option B says he'll win because land is unique, making legal remedies inadequate. But wait, the loan is secured by a mortgage, which is a property interest. However, the issue here is about specific performance of a loan, not the sale of land. Specific performance is typically for unique items, but money is generally considered fungible, so specific performance isn't usually granted for debts. So B might not be correct.

Option C says he'll lose because his only remedy is damages. That makes sense because, generally, you can't get specific performance for monetary loans. If the investor breaches, the developer can sue for damages, but forcing someone to lend money is not typical. So C seems plausible.

Option D says he'll lose because he can't show detrimental reliance. Detrimental reliance is about whether the developer relied on the promise to his detriment. Here, the developer did proceed with construction, so maybe he has detrimental reliance. But I'm not sure if that's the main issue here.

So the main issue is whether specific performance is available. Courts usually don't order specific performance for monetary obligations because money is considered liquid and the remedy of damages (compensation for the loss) is sufficient. Specific performance is typically for unique items, like real estate sales, where the item is one-of-a-kind and money can't compensate adequately.

In this case, the developer is asking the investor to provide $100k. Since money is fungible, the court would likely say that the developer can be compensated with damages if the investor breaches, rather than forcing the investor to lend the money. So the developer's remedy is damages, not specific performance.

Looking at the options again, Option C says he'll lose because his only remedy is damages. That seems correct.

Wait, but what about the written agreement? The Statute of Frauds is satisfied because the loan is over a certain amount and there's a written memorandum. But that doesn't necessarily mean specific performance is granted. It just means the contract is enforceable. The issue is about the type of remedy.

So the answer should be C: lose because only remedy is damages.
</think>

The developer's case hinges on whether specific performance is an appropriate remedy for the investor's breach of contract. Specific performance is typically granted when the item in question is unique and monetary damages would be inadequate. However, monetary obligations, such as loans, are generally considered fungible, and courts usually prefer remedies like damages over specific performance. The written agreement satisfies the Statute of Frauds, making the contract enforceable, but this does not change the nature of the remedy. Since the developer's remedy is damages, not specific performance, he cannot compel the investor to lend the money.
