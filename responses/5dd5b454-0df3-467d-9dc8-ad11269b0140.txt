Okay, so I've got this question here about calculating the percentage of the total wet weight of a hepatocyte contributed by the cell membrane. Hmm, hepatocyte is a liver cell, right? I remember they're pretty large, but the question says to assume it's a cube with 20 micrometers on each edge. Wait, 20 micrometers is 20,000 angstroms because 1 micrometer is 10,000 angstroms. Let me double-check that: 1 μm = 10^4 Å, so 20 μm is 20 * 10^4 = 2e5 Å. Yeah, that makes sense.

The cell membrane is 90 angstroms thick. The specific gravity of both the membrane and the entire cell is 1.0. Specific gravity is the ratio of density to water, so since it's 1.0, the density is the same as water. Water's density is 1 g/cm³. So, I can use that for calculations.

I need to find the percentage of the total wet weight that the membrane contributes. So, I think I need to calculate the volume of the cell membrane and the total volume of the cell, then find the ratio and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

Wait, but the cell is a cube, so volume is edge length cubed. The edge is 20 μm, so the volume is (20e-6 m)^3, but maybe working in cm would be better since density is in g/cm³. Let me think about units.

Wait, maybe it's easier to work in angstroms since the membrane thickness is given in angstroms. Oh, but 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, which might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps converting everything to centimeters.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the total volume of the hepatocyte (cube).
2. Calculate the volume of the cell membrane.
3. Find the mass of each (since density is 1 g/cm³, mass equals volume in grams).
4. Compute the percentage: (membrane mass / total mass) * 100%.

Wait, but the membrane is a thin layer covering the cell. So the volume of the membrane would be the surface area of the cube multiplied by the membrane thickness. Right.

So, total volume of the cell is (edge length)^3.

Edge length is 20 μm, which is 20e-6 meters, but maybe converting to cm: 20 μm = 20e-6 m = 2e-5 m. Wait, 1 meter is 100 cm, so 2e-5 m = 2e-3 cm. Hmm, wait, 1 cm is 0.01 m, so 20 μm is 20e-6 m = 20e-6 * 100 cm/m = 2e-4 cm. Wait, no, wait: 1 m = 100 cm, so 20e-6 m = 20e-6 * 100 cm = 2e-4 cm. So edge length L is 2e-4 cm.

So total volume V_total = L^3 = (2e-4 cm)^3 = 8e-12 cm³.

Now, the surface area of a cube is 6 * (L)^2. So surface area S = 6 * (2e-4 cm)^2 = 6 * 4e-8 cm² = 24e-8 cm² = 2.4e-7 cm².

The membrane is 90 Å thick. Wait, 1 Å is 1e-8 cm because 1 cm is 1e8 Å. So 90 Å = 90e-8 cm = 9e-7 cm.

So the volume of the membrane V_membrane = S * thickness = 2.4e-7 cm² * 9e-7 cm = 2.4e-7 * 9e-7 cm³. Let me calculate that: 2.4 * 9 = 21.6, and exponents: 1e-7 * 1e-7 = 1e-14. So V_membrane = 21.6e-14 cm³ = 2.16e-13 cm³.

Wait, but wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, 2e-4 cm is 0.0002 cm. So L = 2e-4 cm.

V_total = (2e-4)^3 = 8e-12 cm³. Right.

Surface area S = 6*(2e-4)^2 =6 *4e-8=24e-8 cm²=2.4e-7 cm².

Membrane thickness: 90 Å = 90e-8 cm = 9e-7 cm.

So V_mem = 2.4e-7 cm² * 9e-7 cm = (2.4 *9) * 1e-14 cm³ = 21.6e-14 cm³ = 2.16e-13 cm³.

Mass of membrane: Since density is 1 g/cm³, mass = volume in grams. So mass_mem = 2.16e-13 g.

Total mass of the cell: mass_total = V_total * density = 8e-12 cm³ * 1 g/cm³ = 8e-12 g.

Wait, that can't be right because 8e-12 g is 8 picograms, which seems extremely small, but maybe that's correct for a cell. Anyway, proceed.

Wait, no, wait: 1 cm³ is 1e6 μL, but the mass would be in grams. Let me proceed with the calculation.

So percentage = (mass_mem / mass_total) * 100% = (2.16e-13 / 8e-12) * 100% = (0.27 * 1e-1) * 100% = (0.027) * 100% = 2.7%? Wait, that can't be right because the options are all under 0.5%. Hmm, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units. Let me check again.

Wait, 90 Å is 90e-8 cm because 1 Å is 1e-8 cm. So 90 Å = 90 * 1e-8 cm = 9e-7 cm.

Wait, but the surface area is in cm². So when I multiply by thickness in cm, I get cm³, which is correct.

Wait, but maybe the edge length is 20 μm = 20e-6 meters, but converting to cm: 1 meter is 100 cm, so 20e-6 m = 20e-6 * 100 cm = 2e-4 cm. That's correct.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute everything in cm³.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use micrometers for the edge length and convert everything into millimeters or meters, but maybe I messed up the exponents.

Wait, another way: Let's compute the volumes in the same units.

But perhaps I should compute the volumes in cubic angstroms, but since the density is given in g/cm³, maybe better to convert all to cm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the surface area or the membrane volume.

Wait, let me recalculate.

Edge length L = 20 μm = 2e-5 cm (since 1 μm = 1e-5 cm because 1 cm = 1e5 μm). Wait, wait no: 1 cm = 0.01 m, so 1 m is 100 cm, 1 μm is 1e-6 m, which is 1e-4 cm, because 1e-6 m = 1e-6 *100 cm = 1e-4 cm. So 20 μm = 20e-6 m = 20e-4 cm = 2e-3 cm. Wait, that's a different result. Oh, I think I messed up the unit conversion earlier.

Wait, let me clarify: 1 meter is 100 cm. So 1 μm (micrometer) is 1e-6 meters. To convert to cm: 1e-6 m = 1e-6 * 100 cm = 1e-4 cm. So 20 μm = 20 * 1e-4 cm = 2e-3 cm. Oh, so earlier I had 2e-4 cm which is incorrect. It's 2e-3 cm.

That changes everything. So L = 2e-3 cm.

So V_total = L^3 = (2e-3 cm)^3 = 8e-9 cm³.

Surface area S = 6 * (L)^2 =6 * (2e-3)^2 =6 *4e-6 cm²=24e-6 cm²=2.4e-5 cm².

Membrane thickness: 90 Å =90e-8 cm (since 1 Å=1e-8 cm). So 90e-8 cm.

So V_membrane = S * thickness = 2.4e-5 cm² * 90e-8 cm = 2.4e-5 * 9e-7 cm³ = 21.6e-12 cm³ = 2.16e-11 cm³.

Wait, that's 2.16e-11 cm³.

Mass of membrane: density is 1 g/cm³, so mass = volume * density = 2.16e-11 g.

Total mass of cell: V_total * density = 8e-9 cm³ * 1 g/cm³ =8e-9 g.

So percentage = (mass_mem / mass_total) *100% = (2.16e-11 /8e-9) *100% = (0.0027) *100% = 0.27%.

Wait, that's 0.27%, which corresponds to option E. But wait, looking at the options, E is 0.27%, right?

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Because 20 μm is 2e-3 cm.

Yes, 20e-6 meters is 20e-4 cm (since 1m=100cm, 20e-6 m=20e-6 *100 cm=2e-4 cm). Wait, wait, no. Wait, 1 meter is 100 cm, so 1 micrometer is 1e-6 meters, which is 1e-6 *100 cm = 1e-4 cm. So 20 micrometers is 20 *1e-4 cm = 2e-3 cm. So that's correct.

So V_total = (2e-3)^3 =8e-9 cm³.

Surface area S =6*(2e-3)^2=6*4e-6=24e-6 cm²=2.4e-5 cm².

Thickness 90 Å is 90e-8 cm =9e-7 cm.

So V_membrane =2.4e-5 cm² *9e-7 cm= (2.4 *9) e-12 cm³ =21.6e-12 cm³=2.16e-11 cm³.

Mass_mem=2.16e-11 g.

Mass_total=8e-9 g.

So (2.16e-11 /8e-9 ) = (2.16/800) ≈0.0027, which is 0.27%.

So the answer should be E:0.27%.

To calculate the percentage of the total wet weight of a hepatocyte contributed by the cell membrane:

1. **Cell Dimensions and Volume**:  
   - Edge length of the cube: \( L = 20 \, \mu\text{m} = 2 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{cm} \).  
   - Total volume of the cell:  
     \[
     V_{\text{total}} = L^3 = (2 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{cm})^3 = 8 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{cm}^3.
     \]

2. **Surface Area of the Cell**:  
   - Surface area of a cube:  
     \[
     S = 6L^2 = 6 \times (2 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{cm})^2 = 24 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{cm}^2 = 2.4 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{cm}^2.
     \]

3. **Volume of the Cell Membrane**:  
   - Membrane thickness: \( t = 90 \, \text{\AA} = 90 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{cm} = 9 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{cm} \).  
   - Volume of the membrane:  
     \[
     V_{\text{membrane}} = S \times t = (2.4 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{cm}^2) \times (9 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{cm}) = 2.16 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{cm}^3.
     \]

4. **Mass of Membrane and Total Cell**:  
   - Density of the cell and membrane: \( \rho = 1 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \).  
   - Mass of the membrane:  
     \[
     m_{\text{membrane}} = V_{\text{membrane}} \times \rho = 2.16 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{g}.
     \]  
   - Mass of the total cell:  
     \[
     m_{\text{total}} = V_{\text{total}} \times \rho = 8 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{g}.
     \]

5. **Percentage Contribution**:  
   - Percentage of the membrane's mass relative to the total mass:  
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{m_{\text{membrane}}}{m_{\text{total}}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2.16 \times 10^{-11}}{8 \times 10^{-9}} \right) \times 100 = 0.27\%.
     \]

**Final Answer**:  
The percentage of the total wet weight contributed by the cell membrane is **0.27%**, corresponding to option **E**.
