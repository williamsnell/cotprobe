Question:

During 1979, Mr. Anderson expected to earn $20,000. From thisincome he had planned to save $2,000. However, during 1979, Mr. Anderson got a raise which boosted his income to $23,000.If Mr. Anderson ended up saving a total of $3,000 outof his $23,000 income, what was his marginal propensity toconsume (MPC) ? (It may be assumed that if he had not receivedhis raise, Mr. Anderson would have actually saved the$2,000 that he had planned to save.)

Options:

A: 3/5
B: 2/3
C: 3/4
D: 4/5
E: 1/4
F: 7/8
G: 1/2
H: 2/5
I: 1/3
J: 5/6

Okay, so I've got this economics problem here about marginal propensity to consume, or MPC. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Let me read the problem again. Mr. Anderson expected to earn $20,000 in 1979 and planned to save $2,000. Then he got a raise to $23,000 and ended up saving $3,000. The question is asking for his MPC. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

I remember that MPC is the fraction of additional income that a person consumes. It's calculated as MPC = (Change in Consumption) / (Change in Income). But wait, sometimes people think in terms of saving, so maybe I should think about the relationship between MPC and the marginal propensity to save (MPS). Oh right, because MPC + MPS = 1.

Wait, but let me clarify. The problem is about saving, so maybe I should approach it from there. Let's see.

First, let's figure out what his consumption was before and after the raise.

Originally, he planned to save $2,000 out of $20,000. So his planned consumption would have been $20,000 - $2,000 = $18,000.

But after the raise, his income became $23,000, and he ended up saving $3,000. So his actual consumption is $23,000 - $3,000 = $20,000.

Wait, that's interesting. So when his income went up by $3,000 (from $20k to $23k), his saving increased by $1,000 (from $2k to $3k). So his saving went up by $1k, which means his consumption went up by $3k - $1k = $2k. Because his income increased by $3k, and saving by $1k, so consumption must have increased by $2k.

Alternatively, his consumption went from $18k to $20k, so an increase of $2k.

Wait, but let me double-check. His initial income was $20k, saving $2k, so consumption was $18k. After the raise, income is $23k, saving $3k, so consumption is $20k. So the change in income is $3k, and the change in consumption is $2k. So MPC is (change in consumption)/(change in income) = $2k / $3k = 2/3.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because sometimes MPC is calculated based on the change in income leading to a change in consumption. So if income increased by $3k and consumption by $2k, MPC is 2/3.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of saving. The marginal propensity to save (MPS) is the change in saving over change in income. So change in saving is $1k, change in income $3k, so MPS = 1/3. Then MPC is 1 - MPS = 2/3. That makes sense.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. The initial planned saving was $2k, but after the raise, actual saving became $3k. So the change in saving is $1k. The change in income is $3k. So MPS = 1/3, MPC = 2/3.

So the answer should be B: 2/3.

But wait, let me think again. Another approach: MPC is the proportion of additional income that is consumed. So when income increases by $3k, consumption increases by $2k. So MPC = 2/3. Yep, that's consistent.

I think that's correct. So the answer is B.

The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is calculated as the change in consumption divided by the change in income. Initially, Mr. Anderson earned $20,000 and planned to save $2,000, so his planned consumption was $18,000. After the raise, his income became $23,000, and he saved $3,000, making his actual consumption $20,000. The change in income is $3,000, and the change in consumption is $2,000. Therefore, MPC = $2,000 / $3,000 = 2/3. 

Answer: B
