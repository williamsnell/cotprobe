Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me read it again. The question is about red-green colorblindness, which is a recessive X-linked trait. So, I remember that X-linked means the gene is on the X chromosome. Since it's recessive, both copies of the gene would need to be the recessive allele to show the trait, right?

The woman in the question is normal-visioned, but her father was colorblind. Wait, her father's X must come from his mother because fathers give their X to daughters and Y to sons. So if her father was colorblind, he must have given her the recessive c allele. So her genotype for the X chromosome from her father is Xc. But what about her mother's X? Since her mother is normal, she must have given her a normal X, which is XC. So her genotype is Xc (from dad) and XC (from mom), making her XcXc? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, because her father only has one X, and he's colorblind, so he must have given her his Xc. Her mother is normal, so she must have given her an XC. So her genotype is XcXc? Wait, no, wait. No, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the woman's genotype is Xc from dad and XC from mom, so she's XcXC. Because she's female, so two X's. Wait, but that would mean she's a carrier, right? Because she has one normal and one recessive allele. So she's XcXC, which is a carrier, not colorblind because she has one dominant XC allele.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the woman is described as normal-visioned. So she must have at least one dominant allele. Her father was colorblind, so his X must be Xc, and her mother is normal, so she must be XC X something. Wait, but if the woman's father was colorblind, then his X is Xc. So the woman's X from her father is Xc. Her mother must give her an X, which since the woman is normal, it's XC. So she's Xc (from dad) and XC (from mom), making her Xc XC, which is a carrier. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, the father is XcY, right? Because he's male. He gives Xc to his daughter. The mother is normal, so she must have two normal X's, so she's X^C X^C. So she gives X^C to her daughter. So the daughter's genotype is X^C (from mom) and X^c (from dad), so X^C X^c, making her a carrier, not colorblind. So she's not colorblind, which matches the question: the woman is normal-visioned.

Now, she marries a normal-visioned man. So the man is normal, so his genotype is XY, but with X^C, since he's normal. Wait, because the man's X can't be Xc, because he's normal. So his genotype is X^C Y. So when they have children:

Let's look at the possible children. The woman's genotype is X^C X^c. She can pass either X^C or X^c to her children. The man can pass either X^C (if he's giving X) or Y (if he's giving Y). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the man can only give his X or Y. But wait, the man's genotype is X^C Y, so when he produces sperm, each sperm has either X^C or Y. So 50% chance of X^C and 50% Y.

The woman, X^C X^c, when she produces eggs, each egg will have either X^C (50%) or X^c (50%).

So let's think about the possible children:

Daughters get X from dad and X from mom. Wait, no, wait. Wait, daughters get X from dad (since dad gives X or Y; wait, no, no. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, daughters get X from dad and X from mom. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, no. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no: daughters receive X from dad (since dad gives X to daughters and Y to sons). So for daughters:

Daughter's X comes from dad: could be X^C (if dad gives X^C) or Y (but wait, no, daughters get X from dad, not Y). Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, no. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

The man has X^C Y. When he produces gametes, half will be X^C and half Y. So when having a daughter, she must inherit X from dad (either X^C or Y? Wait, no, no. Wait, no, daughters get X from dad and X from mom, so the dad gives X, and the mom gives X. So if the dad gives Y, the child would be a son, because Y plus X from mom makes XY, a son.

So for daughters:

Daughters get X from dad and X from mom. So dad's X is X^C (from his X^C gamete), and mom gives either X^C or X^c.

So for daughters: possible combinations are X^C (from dad) + X^C (from mom) → X^C X^C (normal), or X^C (dad) + X^c (mom) → X^C X^c (carrier).

Sons get X from dad (either X^C or Y) and X from mom (X^C or X^c). Wait, no: sons get Y from dad and X from mom. So sons will have X (from mom) and Y (from dad). So the X from mom could be X^C or X^c.

So for sons: the X from mom determines if they have colorblindness. If mom gives X^c, then the son will be X^c Y (colorblind), since it's recessive. If mom gives X^C, the son is X^C Y (normal).

So now, the question is: what's the probability that their first child is colorblind.

We need to consider the possible children, and for each, the chance of being colorblind.

Wait, but the question is about the first child. So let's think about each possible scenario.

First, what's the chance the child is a daughter or a son? It's roughly 50% each, I think. But since we're looking for colorblindness, which only affects sons (since daughters have two X's and would need two recessive alleles to be colorblind, but the mom is X^C X^c, so she can't give two X^c's to a daughter unless the daughter gets X^c from both parents, but the dad only gives X^C or Y. Wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, no, the daughter can't be colorblind because she has at least one X^C. Because the dad gives X^C, so the daughter can't be X^c X^c. So daughters can't be colorblind because they have X^C (from dad) and possibly X^c (from mom). So their genotype is X^C X^c (carrier) or X^C X^C (normal). So daughters can't be colorblind because they have at least one dominant allele.

So the only way a child can be colorblind is if it's a son and gets X^c from mom and Y from dad.

So let's calculate the probability.

The chance that the child is a son is 50%.

If it's a son, the mom has a 50% chance of passing X^C and 50% of passing X^c.

So the probability of the son being colorblind is (50% chance of being a son) multiplied by (50% chance mom gives X^c) → 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25, or 25%.

Wait, so the overall probability is 1/4, which is 25% chance that the first child is a son who is colorblind.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.

The woman's genotype is X^C X^c. So when she has a child, she can pass either X^C or X^c, each with 50% chance.

The man is X^C Y, so when he has a child, he can pass X^C (to daughter) or Y (to son), each with 50% chance.

So for a daughter: X^C (from dad) and X (from mom, 50% X^C, 50% X^c). So daughter's genotype: 50% X^C X^C (normal), 50% X^C X^c (carrier).

For a son: Y (from dad) and X from mom (50% X^C, 50% X^c).

So the son's X determines colorblindness. If mom gives X^c, son is X^c Y → colorblind. If mom gives X^C, son is X^C Y → normal.

So the probability that a son is colorblind is 50% (from mom) and 50% chance that the child is a son. So 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25, which is 25%.

So the probability is 1/4, which is option G.

The problem involves determining the probability that the first child of a normal-visioned woman (X^C X^c) and a normal-visioned man (X^C Y) will be colorblind. Since red-green colorblindness is an X-linked recessive trait, only sons can be affected because they inherit their X chromosome from their mother and their Y chromosome from their father.

1. **Woman's Genotype**: The woman is normal-visioned (X^C X^c), meaning she has one normal X chromosome (X^C) and one recessive X chromosome (X^c). She can pass either X^C or X^c to her offspring with equal probability (50%).

2. **Man's Genotype**: The man is normal-visioned (X^C Y). He can pass either his X^C or Y chromosome to his offspring with equal probability (50%).

3. **Daughters**: Daughters inherit one X chromosome from their father and one from their mother. Since the father always gives an X^C to daughters, their possible genotypes are:
   - X^C (from father) + X^C (from mother) → X^C X^C (normal vision, 50% chance).
   - X^C (from father) + X^c (from mother) → X^C X^c (carrier, 50% chance).
   Daughters cannot be colorblind because they always inherit at least one dominant X^C allele.

4. **Sons**: Sons inherit their X chromosome from their mother and their Y chromosome from their father. The mother has a 50% chance of passing X^C or X^c to her son:
   - X^C (from mother) + Y (from father) → X^C Y (normal vision, 50% chance).
   - X^c (from mother) + Y (from father) → X^c Y (colorblind, 50% chance).

5. **Probability of Colorblindness**: The probability of having a son is 50%, and the probability that the mother passes the X^c allele to the son is 50%. Therefore, the overall probability that the first child is a colorblind son is:
   \[
   P(\text{colorblind son}) = P(\text{son}) \times P(\text{X}^c \text{ from mother}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
   \]

Thus, the probability that the first child will be colorblind is **1/4**.
