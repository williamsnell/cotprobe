Okay, so I've got this question about AM signal modulation and the percentage modulation based on the antenna current. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, the question says that the antenna current is 15A when the signal is unmodulated, and it increases to 17A when it's modulated. I need to find the percentage modulation. I remember that modulation percentage is related to the changes in the current or maybe the voltage, but I think it's current here.

Wait, percentage modulation for AM signals is usually calculated using the formula: (Im / Ic) * 100%, where Im is the maximum instantaneous current and Ic is the carrier current. But wait, is it the peak current or the average? I'm a bit confused here.

Oh right, when the signal is unmodulated, the current is just the carrier current, which is the minimum current. When it's modulated, the current increases to the maximum. So the maximum current (Im) is 17A, and the carrier current (Ic) is 15A. So the modulation percentage should be (Im - Ic) / Ic * 100. Wait, that makes sense because the modulation is how much the current has increased from the carrier.

Wait, no, wait a minute. I think the formula for percentage modulation is (Im - Ic) divided by Ic, then multiplied by 100. So that would be (17-15)/15 * 100. Let me calculate that: 2/15 is about 0.1333, which is 13.33%. But wait, that's not one of the options listed. The options go from 10% to 90 in increments, but 13% isn't there.

Hmm, maybe I got the formula wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (Im / Ic) * 100, but that would be 17/15 ≈ 1.1333, which is 113.33%, which also isn't an option. Wait, but the options don't go beyond 90%, so maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Oh wait, no, wait. Another thought: in AM, the carrier current Ic is when the signal is unmodulated. When the signal is modulated, the maximum current Im is higher. The formula for the modulation index is m = (Im - Ic) / Ic. But wait, the percentage modulation is m times 100. So m would be (17-15)/15, which is 2/15. Let me calculate that: 2 divided by 15 is approximately 0.1333, which is about 13.33%, which again isn't an option.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the terms. Oh! Wait, perhaps the formula uses the peak current. Alternatively, maybe the formula is (Im / Ic) * 100, but that would be 17/15 ≈ 113%, which doesn't make sense because modulation index can't be more than 100% for AM, as it's a percentage.

Wait, maybe the formula is (Im - Ic) / Ic * 100, but then 2/15 is about 13.33%, which isn't an option. The options given don't have that, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the terms. Let me recall: the carrier current is Ic when unmodulated. When modulated, the maximum current is Ic*(1 + m), where m is the modulation index. So Ic*(1 + m) = Im. So m = (Im/Ic) - 1. Then, percentage modulation is m * 100.

So plugging in the values: Im is 17A, Ic is 15A.

So m = (17/15) - 1 = (1.1333) -1 = 0.1333. So m is 0.1333, so percentage is 13.33%. But again, that's not an option. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, maybe the question is actually using the peak-to-peak current or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the average current, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me double-check the formula. The modulation index m is defined as (Im - Ic)/Ic, which is the same as (Im/Ic) -1. So yes, that's correct. So with the given values, m is 13.33%, but since that's not an option, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the percentage increase in current, which would be (2/15)*100 = 13.33%, but again, not an option.

Looking at the options, the closest is option F, which is 30%. Wait, that's way higher than 13.33. Hmm, maybe I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait another thought: in AM, the maximum current is Ic*(1 + m), and the minimum is Ic*(1 - m), so the peak-to-peak current would be Ic*(2m). So if the current increases from 15A to 17A, perhaps that's the peak current, and the peak-to-peak would be twice that? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the average current is what's given. Oh, wait, maybe the 17A is the peak current, and the unmodulated current is the average. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when the signal is unmodulated, the current is Ic, and when modulated, the maximum current is Ic*(1 + m), and the minimum is Ic*(1 - m). So the average current would be Ic, because it's the same as the carrier. But the peak current would be 17A, so Ic*(1 + m) =17, and Ic is 15. So m= (17/15) -1 ≈ 0.1333, so m=13.33%. But again, not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the peak-to-peak current. So the maximum current is 17A, and the minimum would be Ic*(1 - m). But if the unmodulated current is 15A, which is the average current, perhaps the peak current is 17A, and the minimum is 13A (since 15 is the average of 17 and 13). Then, the modulation index m would be (17 -13)/(2*15) )? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the formula for m is (Im - Ic)/Ic. Or wait, maybe it's (Im - Imin)/Ic, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. The unmodulated current is the carrier current, Ic =15A. When modulated, the current varies between Ic*(1 - m) and Ic*(1 + m). So the maximum current is 15*(1 + m) =17A. So solving for m: 1 + m =17/15=1.1333. So m=0.1333, which is 13.33% modulation. But since that's not an option, perhaps I've done something wrong.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the percentage increase in current. So the current increases by 2A from 15 to 17. So the percentage increase is (2/15)*100 =13.33%. Again, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the ratio of the maximum current to the average current. So 17/15 is about 1.1333, which is 13.33% increase, but again not matching any options.

Wait, the options given are A:100%, B:60%, C:75%, D:25%, E:50%, F:30%, G:20%, H:40%, I:80%, J:90%.

Hmm, 13.33 isn't there. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe the formula is (Im - Ic)/Im *100? Wait, that would be (2/17)*100≈11.76%, which is even worse.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the percentage of the peak current relative to the carrier. So perhaps (Im / Ic)*100 =17/15≈113%, which would imply a modulation index over 100%, which isn't possible for AM. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the 15A is the peak current before modulation, and after modulation, the peak current is 17A. In that case, the percentage modulation would be (17-15)/15 *100=13.33%, which again isn't an option.

Alternatively, maybe the question is using the average current. So when unmodulated, the average is 15A. When modulated, the average remains the same, but the peak current is higher. So the average current doesn't change, but the peak does.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the formula where the percentage modulation is (Im / Ic)*100, but that leads to 113%, which isn't an option. So I'm stuck.

Wait, maybe the options are wrong, or I've made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the total current, including both the carrier and the sidebands. But I'm not sure how that would affect the calculation.

Wait, another approach: the formula for percentage modulation is ( (Im - Ic) / Ic ) * 100. So (17-15)/15=2/15≈0.1333, so 13.33%. But that's not an option. So perhaps the question expects the answer to be based on a different formula.

Wait, maybe the formula is (Im / Ic) *100, but that gives 17/15≈113%, which is over 100, which isn't possible. So that must be wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the average current. No, I don't think so.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is referring to the percentage change in current, which is (2A /15A)*100=13.33%. But again, that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate. 17-15=2. 2/15=0.1333, 0.1333*100=13.33%. So that's 13.33%. But the options don't have that. The closest is option F:30%, but that's way off.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Another thought: percentage modulation is calculated as (Im - Ic)/Ic *100. So (17-15)=2, 2/15=0.1333, so 13.33%. But again, no option matches.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (Im/Ic) *100, which is (17/15)*100=113.33%, which isn't possible because modulation index m can't be more than 100% in AM. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the envelope peak, and the formula is (Im - Ic)/Ic *100. So that's 13.33%.

But since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but among the options, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me check the arithmetic again: 17-15=2, 2/15=0.1333, 0.1333*100=13.33%. Yes, that's correct.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but among the options, the closest is option F:30%.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different formula. Maybe the percentage is calculated as (Im / (Im + Ic)) *100? Let's try that: 17/(17+15)=17/32≈0.53125, which is 53.125%. Not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (Im / (2*Ic)) *100? 17/(2*15)=17/30≈0.5667, which is 56.67%, again not an option.

Hmm, perhaps the formula is (I modulated - I unmodulated)/I unmodulated *100. So that's (17-15)/15=13.33%. Still the same result.

Wait, perhaps the question is incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding it. Alternatively, perhaps the current refers to the RMS current, but that shouldn't change the ratio because current is in DC terms for AM, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is using the formula where percentage modulation is (Im / (Ic)) *100, but that gives 113%, which is impossible. So that must be wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to give the peak current as 17A when unmodulated, which would change everything. But that doesn't make sense because when unmodulated, the current is the carrier current.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just go back to the basics.

In AM, the carrier current is Ic when unmodulated. When modulated, the current varies between Ic*(1 - m) and Ic*(1 + m). So the maximum current is Ic*(1 + m). Given that, Ic is 15A, Im is 17A. So:

17 =15*(1 + m)
=> 1 + m =17/15≈1.1333
=> m=0.1333
So m≈13.33%, which is the modulation index.

Percentage modulation is m*100, so 13.33%.

But the options don't include that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question refers to the average current. Wait, no, because when AM modulated, the average current remains the same as the carrier current. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the total current, including both the carrier and the sidebands. But I'm not sure how that would affect the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should look for another approach. Let me think about the formula for the amplitude modulation percentage.

Percentage modulation (m) = (Im - Ic)/Ic *100

So plugging in the numbers, m = (17-15)/15 *100 = (2/15)*100 ≈13.33%.

Since this isn't an option, perhaps the question expects me to consider that the unmodulated current is the peak, and the modulated current is the average. But that doesn't make sense because the average would be the same as the carrier current.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the formula m = (Im / Ic) *100, which gives 113%, but that's impossible for AM.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a step. Let me think again. The formula for the modulation index m is defined as the ratio of the message signal amplitude to the carrier amplitude. In terms of current, if the carrier current is Ic, then the maximum current when modulated is Ic*(1 + m). So yes, m = (Im - Ic)/Ic.

So with Im=17, Ic=15, m= (17-15)/15=2/15≈0.1333, so 13.33%.

But the options are A:100, B:60, C:75, D:25, E:50, F:30, G:20, H:40, I:80, J:90.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the formula is (Im / (Ic + Im)) *100. Let's try that: 17/(15+17)=17/32≈0.53125→53.125%. Not an option.

Alternatively, (Im / (2*Ic)) *100: 17/(2*15)=17/30≈0.5667→56.67%. Not an option.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question refers to the percentage increase in current, which is (2A /15A)*100=13.33%. But again, no match.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the ratio of the modulated current to twice the carrier current. So 17/(2*15)=17/30≈0.5667→56.67%. Still not an option.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (Im - Ic)/Im *100, which would be (2/17)*100≈11.76%. Not an option.

I'm stuck. The calculation seems correct, but the answer isn't among the options. Maybe I should recheck the problem statement.

The problem says, "the magnitude of the antenna current is 15A when an unmodulated signal is transmitted and it increases to 17A for a modulated signal." So the unmodulated current is 15A, and modulated current is 17A. I think the formula is (Im - Ic)/Ic *100. So 13.33%. But that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but among the options, the closest is F:30%.

Wait, but that's a big gap. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the formula is (Im / Ic) *100, which would be 17/15≈113%, but that's over 100%, which is impossible for AM modulation. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the percentage of the modulated current relative to twice the carrier current. So 17/(2*15)=17/30≈56.67%, which is close to option I:80%, but not really.

Alternatively, maybe the question is using the formula m = (Im / (Ic)) *100, but that gives 113%, which is impossible. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but I must choose from the given options.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 in the formula. Let me think: sometimes, the peak-to-peak current is considered, which is 2*(Im - Ic). So if the maximum current is 17A, the minimum would be Ic*(1 - m). So the peak-to-peak is Im - Imin = [15*(1 + m)] - [15*(1 - m)] = 30m. So 30m =17 - [15*(1 -m)].

Wait, let me write the equations again.

When modulated, the current varies between Ic*(1 - m) and Ic*(1 + m). So Im = Ic*(1 + m) =17A.

Ic is 15A, so 15*(1 + m)=17 →1 + m=17/15 → m=17/15 -1=2/15≈0.1333.

So m=13.33%, which is the modulation index. So the percentage modulation is 13.33%.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the question expects the answer to be option F:30%, but I don't see how that aligns with the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is m= (Im - Ic)/ (Im + Ic) *100. Let's try that: (2)/(32)*100=6.25%. Not an option.

Wait, maybe the formula is m= (Im - Ic)/Im *100. So (2/17)*100≈11.76%. No.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is m= (Im/Ic) -1, which is 17/15 -1≈0.1333, which is 13.33%.

I'm stuck. The calculation points to 13.33%, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but among the options, the closest is F:30%. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage increase in current, which is 13.33%, but again, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the percentage of the carrier current that is the modulation. That would be m=13.33%, but again, not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when the signal is modulated, the current increases to 17A, which is the peak, but the average current is still 15A. So the peak is 17A, which is Ic*(1 + m). So same calculation as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the formula where the percentage modulation is (Im / (Ic)) *100, which would be 17/15≈113%, but that's impossible for AM.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. The correct calculation leads to 13.33%, which isn't an option. But perhaps the intended answer is option F:30%, but I don't see how that comes about.

Wait, perhaps the formula is m= (Im - Ic)/ (Im + Ic) *100. Then, (2)/(32)*100=6.25%. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is m= (Im / (Im + Ic)) *100. 17/(32)=53.125%. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps the formula is m= (Im / (2*Ic)) *100. 17/(30)=56.67%. Not an option.

I think I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me try to look up the formula for percentage modulation.

Upon checking, the formula for percentage modulation (m) is indeed given by:

m = (Im - Ic) / Ic * 100%

Where:
- Im = maximum current when modulated
- Ic = carrier current (unmodulated)

So plugging in the numbers:

m = (17 -15)/15 *100 = (2/15)*100 ≈13.33%

But since this isn't an option, perhaps the question has a typo, or I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the percentage change in the square of the current, which relates to power. Because in AM, power is proportional to the square of the current.

So, the carrier power is P_c = I_c^2 * some resistance. When modulated, the maximum power is P_m = I_m^2 * same resistance.

The percentage increase in power would be [(P_m - P_c)/P_c] *100 = [(I_m^2 - I_c^2)/I_c^2] *100.

But the question is about current, not power. So perhaps that's not relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage increase in power, which would be ((17^2 -15^2)/15^2)*100.

Calculating:

17^2=289, 15^2=225.

289-225=64.

64/225≈0.2844 →28.44%, which is about 28.44%. The closest option is F:30%.

Ah, perhaps that's the intended approach. So the percentage modulation is calculated based on power, not current. So the percentage increase in power is approximately 28.44%, which rounds to 30%, option F.

Wait, but percentage modulation is typically based on current, not power. So I'm not sure, but perhaps the question expects this approach.

So, perhaps the answer is F:30%.
</think>

The question involves determining the percentage modulation of an AM signal based on the antenna current. The unmodulated current is 15A, and the modulated current increases to 17A. The formula for percentage modulation is:

\[
\text{Percentage Modulation} = \left( \frac{\text{Im} - \text{Ic}}{\text{Ic}} \right) \times 100
\]

Where:
- \( \text{Im} = 17 \, \text{A} \) (maximum current when modulated),
- \( \text{Ic} = 15 \, \text{A} \) (carrier current when unmodulated).

Plugging in the values:

\[
\text{Percentage Modulation} = \left( \frac{17 - 15}{15} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{15} \right) \times 100 \approx 13.33\%
\]

However, 13.33% is not among the provided options. Considering the possibility that the question refers to the percentage increase in power (as power is proportional to the square of the current), the percentage increase in power is calculated as:

\[
\text{Percentage Increase in Power} = \left( \frac{\text{Im}^2 - \text{Ic}^2}{\text{Ic}^2} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{17^2 - 15^2}{15^2} \right) \times 100
\]

Calculating:

\[
17^2 = 289, \quad 15^2 = 225, \quad \text{Difference} = 289 - 225 = 64
\]

\[
\text{Percentage Increase in Power} = \left( \frac{64}{225} \right) \times 100 \approx 28.44\%
\]

Rounding to the nearest option, the closest match is **30%**, which corresponds to option F.

**Answer: F**
