Alright, so I've got this problem about capacitive reactance, and I'm a bit rusty on my electronics, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is: A capacitor offers 25 ohms of capacitive reactance in a 400-cps circuit. We need to find its capacitance, and there are multiple-choice options from A to J.

First, I remember that capacitive reactance (Xc) is given by the formula Xc = 1/(2πfC), where f is the frequency and C is the capacitance in farads. Wait, let me make sure I got that right. Yeah, I think that's correct. So, rearranging the formula to solve for C should give me C = 1/(2πfXc).

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The formula is Xc equals 1 over (2π times f times C). So to solve for C, I need to invert both sides. So, C equals 1 divided by (2πfXc). Hmm, but wait, no, wait. Let me get that right. Let me write it out:

Xc = 1 / (2πfC)

So to solve for C, I can rearrange this equation. Multiply both sides by (2πfC):

Xc * 2πfC = 1

Then, divide both sides by Xc * 2πf:

C = 1 / (Xc * 2πf)

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if I have Xc = 1/(2πfC), then I can rearrange to C = 1/(2πf Xc). Yeah, that makes sense because when you take the reciprocal of both sides, you get 1/Xc = 2πfC, so C = 1/(2πf Xc). Right, that seems correct.

So, now I have the formula. Let's plug in the numbers. The given values are Xc = 25 ohms, and f = 400 cps (which I think is the same as 400 Hz, since cps stands for cycles per second). So f = 400 Hz.

Plugging into the formula: C = 1 / (2π * 400 * 25)

Let me calculate the denominator first. 2π is approximately 6.2832. So 2π * 400 = 6.2832 * 400. Let me compute that. 6 * 400 is 2400, 0.2832 *400 is about 113.28, so total is about 2513.28.

Wait, wait, 6.2832 *400: Let's compute it accurately. 400 *6 = 2400, 400 *0.2832 = 113.28, so 2400 +113.28 = 2513.28.

So now, multiply that by 25: 2513.28 *25. Let me calculate that. 2500 *25 is 62,500. 13.28 *25 is 332. So total is 62,500 + 332 = 62,832.

So the denominator is 62,832. Now, C = 1 / 62,832. Let me compute that. 1 divided by 62,832 equals approximately 1.5915e-5 farads. Wait, but that's in farads. Since the options are in microfarads, I need to convert.

I know that 1 farad is 1,000,000 microfarads. So 1.5915e-5 farads is 1.5915e-5 * 1e6 = 15.915 microfarads. Hmm, that's approximately 15.915 microfarads.

Looking at the options, the closest one would be option J: 14 microfarads, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in my calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me go through the numbers again.

Calculating 2πfXc:

f =400 Hz, Xc=25 ohms.

2π = 6.283185307.

So 2πf = 6.283185307 * 400 = 2513.274124.

Multiply that by Xc (25): 2513.274124 *25. Let me compute this accurately.

2513.274124 *25: 2500 *25 =62,500. 13.274124 *25 = 331.8531.

Adding together: 62,500 +331.8531 =62,831.8531.

So 2πfXc is approximately 62,831.85.

So 1 divided by 62,831.85 is approximately 1.5915e-5 farads, which is 15.915 microfarads.

Hmm, the options don't have 15.9, but let me check the options again.

Options:

A:18, B:30, C:8, D:20, E:25, F:16, G:10, H:22, I:12, J:14.

Wait, none of the options are exactly 15.9. The closest is F:16, which is 16 microfarads. But wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the formula. Did I get the formula right?

Wait, another way: Xc = 1/(2πfC). So C = 1/(2πf Xc). Yes, that's correct. So maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise numbers. Let me try that.

Compute 2π *400 *25:

2π =6.283185307.

400 *25 =10,000.

So 6.283185307 *10,000 =62,831.85307.

So 1 /62,831.85307 = approximately 1.591549431e-5 farads.

Convert to microfarads: 1.591549431e-5 *1e6 =15.91549431 microfarads.

Hmm, so approximately 15.92 microfarads. The options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me check the formula again. Maybe I flipped the formula. Oh no, wait a second. Oh no, wait a minute—wait, wait, I think I got the formula wrong! Because I remember that capacitive reactance is inversely proportional to capacitance and directly proportional to frequency. But hold on, perhaps I should double-check the formula.

Wait, the correct formula for capacitive reactance is Xc = 1/(2πfC). So yes, that's correct. So the steps I did are correct.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of 2πf Xc. Let me try to compute it again.

2πf = 2 * 3.1415926535 * 400.

So 3.1415926535 *400 = 1256.6370614.

Multiply by 2: 2513.2741228.

Then multiply by Xc, which is 25: 2513.2741228 *25.

Let me compute this more accurately.

2513.2741228 *25:

25 *2000 =50,000

25 *500 =12,500 → 50,000 +12,500 =62,500

25 *13.2741228 = let's compute 13 *25 =325, 0.2741228 *25 ≈6.85307.

So 325 +6.85307 ≈331.85307.

Add that to 62,500: 62,500 +331.85307 =62,831.85307.

So denominator is 62,831.85307. So 1/ that is 1.59154943e-5 farads, which is 15.9154943 microfarads.

So about 15.92 microfarads. But the options don't have that. The closest is F:16. But wait, let me check the options again.

Wait, option F is 16 microfarads. So that's the closest. But wait, none of the options match exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, another way: Xc = 1/(2πfC) → C = 1/(2πf Xc).

Wait, but perhaps I should use the formula as C = 1/(2πf Xc) → 1/(2πf Xc) = 1 / (2 * π * 400 *25).

Wait, let me compute 2 * π *400 *25.

2 * π is about 6.28319.

400 *25 is 10,000.

So 6.28319 *10,000 =62,831.9.

So 1/62,831.9 = approx 1.5915e-5 F, which is 15.915e-6 F, or 15.915 microfarads.

Hmm. So none of the options are exactly that. The closest is F:16, but let me check the options again to make sure I didn't miss something.

Wait, the options are:

A:18, B:30, C:8, D:20, E:25, F:16, G:10, H:22, I:12, J:14.

So F is 16, which is the closest to 15.915. But wait, perhaps I should consider that maybe the frequency is given in cps, which is the same as Hz, so that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should check if I used the correct formula. Wait, another approach: sometimes, formulas are written as Xc = 1/(ωC), where ω is the angular frequency (ω = 2πf). So that's the same as what I used.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me check: the answer is in microfarads, so 15.915 microfarads is correct.

Wait, but in the options, 16 is F. So perhaps that's the intended answer. Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1/(2π *400 *25) again.

Let me compute 2 * π =6.28319.

6.28319 *400 =2513.276.

2513.276 *25 =62,831.9.

1/62,831.9 = 1.5915e-5 F =15.915 μF.

Wait, so 15.915 is approximately 16 μF, which is option F. So the answer should be F:16 microfarads.

But wait, the options don't have 16 as the answer. Wait, let me check the options again. Oh wait, yes, option F is 16. So I think that's the correct answer.

Wait, but looking back, the options don't have 16. Wait, no, the options do have F:16. So that must be the correct choice.

Wait, but wait the initial calculation gives about 15.915, which is very close to 16. So I think the intended answer is F:16 microfarads.

To determine the capacitance \( C \) of a capacitor given its capacitive reactance \( X_c = 25 \, \Omega \) and the frequency \( f = 400 \, \text{Hz} \), we use the formula for capacitive reactance:

\[
X_c = \frac{1}{2\pi f C}
\]

Rearranging for \( C \):

\[
C = \frac{1}{2\pi f X_c}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
C = \frac{1}{2 \cdot \pi \cdot 400 \cdot 25}
\]

First, calculate \( 2\pi \):

\[
2\pi \approx 6.283185307
\]

Then, calculate \( 2\pi f \):

\[
2\pi \cdot 400 = 6.283185307 \cdot 400 \approx 2513.274124
\]

Next, multiply by \( X_c = 25 \):

\[
2513.274124 \cdot 25 = 62831.8531
\]

Now, compute \( C \):

\[
C = \frac{1}{62831.8531} \approx 1.5915 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{F}
\]

Convert to microfarads (\( 1 \, \text{F} = 10^6 \, \mu\text{F} \)):

\[
C \approx 1.5915 \times 10^{-5} \times 10^6 = 15.915 \, \mu\text{F}
\]

The closest option to \( 15.915 \, \mu\text{F} \) is **16 microfarads**, which corresponds to option **F**.
