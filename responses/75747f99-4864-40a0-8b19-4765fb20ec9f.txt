Question:

A man filed a federal diversity action against a bus company, seeking damages for injuries he had sustained in an accident while riding a bus owned by the company. The man demanded a jury trial. After the parties' attorneys examined the prospective jurors and exercised their challenges, six jurors and two alternate jurors were chosen. During the trial, two jurors became ill and were replaced by the alternate jurors. At the conclusion of replaced by the alternate jurors. At the conclusion of the trial, a third juror also became ill, and the court excused that juror. The parties' attorneys stipulated to the return of a verdict from a five-person jury. The jury then deliberated and returned a verdict for the company. The man timely filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that the five-person jury was not large enough to return a verdict. Should the court grant the motion?

Options:

A: No, because the verdict was reached before the third juror was excused.
B: No, because the court properly excused the three jurors due to illness.
C: Yes, because there must be at least six jurors on a federal civil jury.
D: Yes, because there must be at least 12 jurors on a federal civil jury.
E: Yes, because the replacement of jurors during the trial invalidated the verdict.
F: Yes, because the stipulation of the attorneys cannot override federal jury size requirements.
G: No, because the parties stipulated to a verdict from a jury of fewer than six jurors.
H: No, because the illness of jurors is a valid reason for reducing the jury size.
I: No, because the remaining jurors were sufficient to reach a unanimous decision.
J: Yes, because the man was not given a fair trial due to the reduced jury size.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this question about a jury trial in a federal diversity action. Let's break down the scenario step by step.

So, the man sued a bus company and demanded a jury trial. The standard in federal courts for civil cases is usually 12 jurors, but I remember there's some flexibility. The process was that they selected six jurors and two alternates. Then, during the trial, two jurors got sick and were replaced by the alternates. So now we have the two alternates plus the remaining four original jurors, making six again, right? 

But wait, at the end of the trial, a third juror fell ill. The court excused that juror, and then the attorneys agreed to let the verdict be returned by a five-person jury. The jury deliberated and found for the company. Now the man is asking for a new trial because he thinks a five-person jury isn't enough.

Hmm, what's the rule about jury sizes in federal civil trials? I think Rule 48 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure deals with this. From what I recall, the default is 12 jurors, but the parties can agree to a smaller number, but there's a minimum. I think the minimum is six jurors. So if they reduce it below six, that's a problem.

In this case, the court ended up with a five-person jury. The question is whether that's allowed. The options suggest that some think it's okay because the parties stipulated, while others argue the size is too small.

Looking at the options:

Option C says there must be at least six jurors. That aligns with what I rememberâ€”federal juries can't be smaller than six. So if they went down to five, that's below the minimum. But wait, the initial selection was six plus two alternates. Two got sick, so they used the alternates to replace them, keeping six. Then a third got sick, so the court excused that juror, leaving five. The attorneys stipulated to the verdict from five.

So the problem is whether a five-person jury is permissible. Since the minimum is six, having a five-person jury would be invalid. Therefore, the verdict should be set aside because the jury was too small.

Looking at the options again, option C says yes because there must be at least six. Option F says yes because the stipulation can't override the requirement, which also sounds correct. Option G says no because the parties stipulated, but I think stipulation can't go below the minimum required by law.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. I thought that in federal court, the parties can agree to a jury of fewer than 12, but not fewer than six. So if they agreed to five, that's against the rule. So the court should grant the motion because the jury was too small.

Alternatively, maybe the replacement during the trial affects it. But the main issue is the size at the time of the verdict. So the fact that they started with six, then went down to five, which is below the minimum. So the verdict should be overturned.

So the correct answer would be C or F. Option C says yes because of the six-juror requirement, which is correct. Option F says the stipulation can't override the requirement, also correct. But which one is more accurate?

The question is whether the court should grant the motion. The reason is that the jury was too small. So either C or F could be right. But looking back, the options are:

C: Yes, because there must be at least six jurors on a federal civil jury.

F: Yes, because the replacement of jurors during the trial invalidated the verdict.

Wait, no, the replacement during the trial isn't the main issue here. The main issue is the final jury size. The replacement is allowed during the trial, but the final verdict must be from a jury that meets the minimum size.

So the correct reason is that the jury size was too small, which is option C. Alternatively, option F says the stipulation can't override the requirements. So both C and F point to yes.

But looking at the possible answers, the options C and F both say yes but for different reasons. The correct reason is the minimum size, not necessarily the stipulation. Because the stipulation can't go below the minimum. So the court should grant the motion because the jury was too small.

Therefore, the correct answer is C or F. Wait, looking back, the options:

C: Yes, because there must be at least six jurors on a federal civil jury.

F: Yes, because the replacement of jurors during the trial invalidated the verdict.

Hmm, I think the issue isn't the replacement but the final size. So the correct reason is the minimum size, which is option C.

Wait, but also, the court can't let the jury drop below six. So the stipulation to have five was invalid. So the verdict should be set aside. So yes, the motion should be granted.

So the correct answer is either C or F. Let me check the options again.

Option C says yes because of the six-juror requirement. Option F says yes because the stipulation can't override. Both are correct, but the more direct reason is the minimum size. So I think C is the better answer.

Wait, but in reality, the parties can't stipulate to a jury smaller than six. So the court would have to set it aside because the stipulation is invalid. So perhaps F is correct.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn. Let me think again. The Federal Rules allow for a jury of fewer than 12 if the parties agree, but not fewer than six. So if the parties stipulate to five, that's against the rules, so the verdict is invalid. So the court must grant the motion for new trial.

So the correct reason is either because it's below six (C) or because the stipulation can't override the requirement (F). Both are correct, but the question is whether the court should grant the motion.

I think the answer is C: Yes, because there must be at least six jurors on a federal civil jury.

The question revolves around whether a federal civil jury with five members is valid. Federal Rule 48 requires at least six jurors for a civil trial, and parties cannot stipulate to fewer than six. Since the jury reduced to five, the verdict must be overturned. 

Answer: C
