Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics question here, and I need to figure out the change in entropy when the temperature of a gas increases from 100 K to 101 K, while the volume is kept constant. Hmm, I remember that entropy change has something to do with heat transfer and temperature. Let me think about what I learned.

I recall that when a process is reversible and the volume is constant, the change in entropy (ΔS) can be calculated using the formula ΔS = nCv ln(T2/T1), where Cv is the molar specific heat at constant volume. Oh wait, but wait, the problem gives the entropy change per mole, so maybe I don't need to worry about the number of moles here. So the formula might simplify to ΔS = Cv ln(T2/T1) per mole.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Another formula I remember is ΔS = Q_rev / T, where Q_rev is the heat added reversibly. Since the volume is constant, the heat added should be related to the change in internal energy, which for an ideal gas is Q = nCv ΔT. So for a mole, it's Cv ΔT.

But wait, since entropy change is ΔS = ∫(dQ_rev / T), and for constant volume, dQ = Cv dT. So integrating from T1 to T2 gives Cv ln(T2/T1). So yeah, ΔS = Cv ln(T2/T1).

But wait, the problem doesn't give me Cv. Oh wait, but wait, the options are given in J/(mole·K), so perhaps the Cv is assumed to be a specific value. Wait, for an ideal monatomic gas, Cv is (3/2)R, where R is the gas constant, approximately 8.314 J/(mol·K). Wait, no, wait. R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), but for Cv, for monatomic gases, it's (3/2)R, which is about 12.47 J/(mol·K). For diatomic gases at room temperature, it's (5/2)R, which is about 20.78 J/(mol·K). But wait, the problem doesn't specify the type of gas, so maybe I should use the general approach without assuming Cv.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another thought: when volume is constant, the change in entropy can also be calculated using ΔS = n Cv ln(T2/T1). But since the answer is per mole, n=1, so ΔS = Cv ln(101/100). But without knowing Cv, how can I proceed? Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the problem assumes that the gas is ideal, and perhaps uses the molar specific heat at constant volume. Alternatively, perhaps the entropy change formula can be written as ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1) when pressure is constant, but that's not the case here. Since volume is constant, it's Cv.

Wait, but maybe I should think in terms of the general formula. The entropy change for a process at constant volume is ΔS = n Cv ln(T2/T1). So since n is per mole, it's Cv ln(101/100). But without knowing Cv, that doesn't help. Wait, but perhaps the problem expects me to use the value of Cp or Cv as a given value.

Alternatively, wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the heat added is such that Q = n Cv (T2 - T1), so the entropy change would be Q_rev / T_avg, but that's an approximation. Alternatively, using the exact integral, which would be Cv ln(T2/T1).

But wait, I'm stuck because I don't have the value of Cv. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the problem uses the molar specific heat in a different way. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the formula for entropy change when temperature changes at constant volume is ΔS = n Cv ln(T2/T1). Assuming Cv is the molar specific heat, which is (3/2)R for monatomic gases. So let's plug in the numbers.

R is 8.314 J/(mol·K). So Cv = (3/2)*8.314 ≈ 12.47 J/(mol·K).

ΔS = 12.47 * ln(101/100). Let me calculate ln(1.01). I remember that ln(1+x) ≈ x - x²/2 + x³/3... for small x. So x=0.01, so ln(1.01) ≈ 0.00995.

So ΔS ≈ 12.47 * 0.00995 ≈ 0.124 J/(mol·K). Looking at the options, option F is 0.100, option D is 0.125, which is very close to 0.124. So that would be option D: 0.125 J/(mol·K).

Wait, but wait, the options don't have 0.124, but D is 0.125, which is very close. So I think the answer is D.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute ln(1.01) more precisely.

Using a calculator, ln(1.01) ≈ 0.00995033.

So 12.47 * 0.00995033 ≈ let's compute that.

12.47 * 0.00995 = approximately 0.124 J/(mol·K). So yes, 0.124 is very close to 0.125. So option D is the best choice.

The change in entropy of a gas when the temperature increases from 100 K to 101 K at constant volume can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\Delta S = n C_v \ln\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)
\]

Since the problem specifies the entropy change per mole, \( n = 1 \), and \( C_v \) is the molar specific heat at constant volume. For an ideal monatomic gas, \( C_v = \frac{3}{2}R \), where \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \). Thus, \( C_v \approx 12.47 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \).

The temperature ratio is \( \frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{101}{100} = 1.01 \), and \( \ln(1.01) \approx 0.00995 \). Substituting these values:

\[
\Delta S = 12.47 \times 0.00995 \approx 0.124 \, \text{J/(mol·K)}
\]

Among the given options, the closest value is \( 0.125 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \), which corresponds to option D.
