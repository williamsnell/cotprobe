Okay, so I need to find the eigenvalues of the matrix A, which is [[5, 4], [1, 2]]. Hmm, eigenvalues are those special numbers associated with a matrix, right? I remember that to find them, I need to solve the characteristic equation. The characteristic equation is found by subtracting λ from the diagonal elements and then taking the determinant.

So the matrix A is a 2x2 matrix. Let me set it up. The general form for a 2x2 matrix [[a, b], [c, d]] has eigenvalues found by solving the equation (a-λ)(d-λ) - bc = 0. So expanding that, it becomes λ² - (a+d)λ + (ad - bc) = 0. This is the characteristic equation, and its roots are the eigenvalues.

Looking at matrix A, a is 5, d is 2. So a+d is 5+2=7. Then, ad is 5*2=10, and bc is 4*1=4. So ad - bc is 10-4=6. So the characteristic equation should be λ² -7λ +6=0.

Now I need to solve this quadratic equation. The quadratic formula is λ = [7 ± sqrt(7² -4*1*6)] / 2. Let me compute the discriminant first: 7² is 49, and 4*1*6 is 24. So sqrt(49-24) = sqrt(25) =5. So the eigenvalues are [7+5]/2 and [7-5]/2. Calculating those, (7+5)=12, 12/2=6. (7-5)=2, 2/2=1. So the eigenvalues are 6 and 1.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is [6,1], option G is [1,6]. Both are the same eigenvalues, just ordered differently. So which one is correct? Oh, wait, eigenvalues are a set, so the order doesn't matter. Let me check the options again.

Option A: [2,6] → No, because one eigenvalue is 1. Option B: [6,1] → Yes, that's what I got. Option G: [1,6], same as B but reversed. So perhaps both B and G are correct? No, wait, the options list them in a specific order. Looking back, the question asks for "its eigenvalues" without specifying order, but the options present them as ordered lists. So both B and G would be correct if the question allows any order. But checking the options, I see that option B is [6,1], and option G is [1,6]. So both are correct, but in the options, only one is present. Wait, looking back at the options, I think the answer expects both numbers, regardless of order. So which option matches?

Wait, let me check the options again:

Options:

A: [2,6]

B: [6,1]

C: [4,1]

D: [2,5]

E: [3,5]

F: [0,7]

G: [1,6]

H: [5,2]

I: [-1,8]

J: [3,4]

So both B and G present the same eigenvalues, just in reverse order. But in the options, B is [6,1] and G is [1,6]. So both are correct, but only one of them is an option. Wait, no, each option is a list, and in the question, the eigenvalues are 6 and 1. So either B or G is correct. But looking back at the options, I think I made a mistake. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, the trace of the matrix is 5+2=7, and the determinant is 5*2 -4*1=10-4=6. So the characteristic equation is λ² -7λ +6=0. Factoring, this equation becomes (λ-6)(λ-1)=0. So the roots are 6 and 1. So the eigenvalues are 6 and 1.

Looking back at the options, option B is [6,1], and option G is [1,6]. So both are correct, but the options probably list the eigenvalues in a specific order, perhaps sorted in some way. But in the options given, both B and G are present. Wait, but in the options provided, only one of them is correct. Let me check the problem statement again.

Wait, the question asks for the eigenvalues of A=[[5,4],[1,2]]. The eigenvalues are 6 and 1. So the correct option is either B or G. Looking at the options, both B and G are present. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, maybe I messed up the determinant. A is [[5,4],[1,2]]. So determinant is (5)(2) - (4)(1) = 10 -4 =6. Correct. Trace is 5+2=7. So characteristic equation: λ² -7λ+6=0. Roots at λ= [7±sqrt(49-24)]/2 = [7±5]/2 → 12/2=6 and 2/2=1. So yes, eigenvalues are 6 and 1.

So the correct options are B: [6,1] and G: [1,6]. But looking at the given options, which one is correct? Wait, perhaps the options are presented in a specific order, and only one is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the determinant or trace.

Wait, another way to check: maybe I should compute the eigenvalues manually. Let me try another approach. The characteristic equation is det(A - λI) =0.

So A - λI is [[5-λ,4],[1,2-λ]]. The determinant is (5-λ)(2-λ) - (4)(1) = (10 -5λ -2λ +λ²) -4 = λ² -7λ +10 -4 = λ² -7λ +6. So same as before. So roots at 6 and 1.

So the eigenvalues are 6 and 1. Now, looking at the options, which one lists these two numbers? Option B is [6,1], option G is [1,6]. Both are correct, but I think the answer expects the eigenvalues in a specific order. Wait, perhaps the options list them in ascending order. 1 and 6 are in that order in option G. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option B, which has 6 first.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify the order, so any option that includes both 6 and 1 is correct. But in the given options, both B and G are correct. So perhaps the correct answer is either B or G. But looking at the options, I think the correct answer is option B: [6,1]. Or wait, maybe I should check the options again to see if either B or G is present.

Looking back, the options are:

A: [2,6]

B: [6,1]

C: [4,1]

D: [2,5]

E: [3,5]

F: [0,7]

G: [1,6]

H: [5,2]

I: [-1,8]

J: [3,4]

So both B and G are present. Hmm. But in the options, only one can be correct because each letter is an option. So perhaps the answer is option B or G, but in the given options, perhaps the correct answer is option B: [6,1]. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, another way: perhaps I should compute the eigenvalues numerically. Let me compute the roots again. The quadratic equation λ² -7λ +6=0. The roots are [7 ± sqrt(49-24)]/2 → [7±5]/2 → 12/2=6, 2/2=1. So yes, 6 and 1.

So the eigenvalues are 6 and 1. So the correct options are B and G. But since each option is a unique letter, perhaps the correct answer is B: [6,1]. Or maybe the answer expects the larger number first, which would be B. Alternatively, perhaps the options list them in a different order.

Wait, but looking back, the options are as given, and both B and G are present. But in the problem, I think the answer is option B: [6,1]. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option G: [1,6]. Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for both in the options and see which one is present.

Wait, the options are:

A: [2,6]

B: [6,1]

C: [4,1]

D: [2,5]

E: [3,5]

F: [0,7]

G: [1,6]

H: [5,2]

I: [-1,8]

J: [3,4]

So both B and G are present. Hmm. So perhaps the answer is either B or G. But I think the correct eigenvalues are 6 and 1, so both B and G are correct. But since only one option can be selected, perhaps the answer is option B: [6,1]. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B because it's listed first.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The eigenvalues are 6 and 1, so the correct option is the one that includes both 6 and 1, regardless of order. So both B and G are correct. But since the options are separate, perhaps the intended answer is option B: [6,1].

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the determinant again.

Matrix A: [[5,4],[1,2]]

Determinant: (5)(2) - (4)(1) = 10 -4 =6. Correct.

Trace: 5+2=7. Correct.

So characteristic equation: λ² -7λ +6=0 → (λ-6)(λ-1)=0 → λ=6,1.

So yes, the eigenvalues are 6 and 1. So the correct options are B and G. But in the given options, both are present. So perhaps the correct answer is option B: [6,1], as it's the first occurrence.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option G: [1,6]. But I'm not sure why both would be present as separate options. Maybe the answer is option B.

Wait, perhaps the eigenvalues are 6 and 1, so the correct answer is option B: [6,1]. Alternatively, perhaps I should select option G. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option B, but I'm a bit unsure because both B and G seem correct. Maybe I should look for another way to confirm.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the eigenvalues by another method, like using the fact that the sum of eigenvalues equals the trace, which is 7, and the product equals the determinant, which is 6. So looking for two numbers that add up to 7 and multiply to 6. Let's see: 6 and 1. 6+1=7, 6*1=6. So yes, correct.

So the eigenvalues are 6 and 1. So the correct options are B and G. But since only one option can be chosen, perhaps the answer is option B: [6,1].

Wait, but looking at the options again, option B is [6,1], and option G is [1,6]. So both are correct, but the options are separate. So perhaps the intended answer is option B, as it's the first occurrence. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

So I think the answer is option B: [6,1].

To find the eigenvalues of the matrix \( A = \begin{bmatrix} 5 & 4 \\ 1 & 2 \end{bmatrix} \), we solve the characteristic equation. The characteristic equation for a 2x2 matrix is given by:

\[
\lambda^2 - (\text{trace}(A))\lambda + \det(A) = 0
\]

1. **Trace of \( A \):**  
   \[
   \text{trace}(A) = 5 + 2 = 7
   \]

2. **Determinant of \( A \):**  
   \[
   \det(A) = (5)(2) - (4)(1) = 10 - 4 = 6
   \]

3. **Characteristic equation:**  
   \[
   \lambda^2 - 7\lambda + 6 = 0
   \]

4. **Solving the quadratic equation:**  
   Using the quadratic formula \( \lambda = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -7 \), and \( c = 6 \):
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49 - 24}}{2} = \frac{7 \pm 5}{2}
   \]
   This gives the roots:
   \[
   \lambda_1 = \frac{12}{2} = 6, \quad \lambda_2 = \frac{2}{2} = 1
   \]

The eigenvalues are \( 6 \) and \( 1 \). Among the given options, both \( [6, 1] \) and \( [1, 6] \) are correct, but since the question asks for a single answer, the correct choice is:

**Answer: B**
