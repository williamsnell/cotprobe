Okay, so I'm trying to answer this biology question about plant tissues. The question is asking which tissue is responsible for new growth in plants. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the right one. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that plants have different types of tissues, each with specific functions. The main ones I recall are epidermal, ground, vascular, and maybe some others like meristematic. I think meristematic tissues are involved in growth because they have dividing cells, which would lead to new growth.

Option A is Apical tissue. I'm not too sure about that. I think apical refers to the tips, like the growing tips of stems or roots. But wait, apical might be part of the meristematic tissue. Maybe they're the same thing? Or perhaps apical is a different term.

Option B is Sclerenchyma. I remember that sclerenchyma is a type of vascular tissue, specifically a supporting tissue. It's tough and provides structure, like in stems. So probably not responsible for growth.

Option C is Ground tissue. Ground tissue, I think, makes up the interior of the plant, like parenchyma cells which are involved in storage and other functions. So ground tissue is more about supporting and storing, not growing.

Option D is Vascular tissue. Vascular tissues include xylem and phloem, which transport water and nutrients. They're essential for the plant's function but not directly responsible for new growth.

Option E is Cork tissue. Cork is part of the periderm, which is the outer layer of the stem. It's protective, like the bark. So not related to new growth.

Option F is Collenchyma. Collenchyma is another supporting tissue, providing flexibility. It's found in the stems, but again, not the growth part.

Option G is Periderm. Periderm includes the epidermis and cork cambium. It's the outer covering, so it's more about protection and maybe secondary growth, but not the primary growth areas.

Option H is Parenchyma. Parenchyma is a type of ground tissue involved in various functions like storage, photosynthesis, and sometimes wound healing. Not directly about growth initiation.

Option I is Epidermal tissue. Epidermis covers the plant and protects it, but I don't think it's responsible for the actual growth, though it might contribute to surface expansion.

Option J is Meristematic tissue. Meristematic tissues are definitely involved in growth because they consist of undifferentiated cells that divide and differentiate into other types of tissues. The apical meristems are at the tips of roots and stems, causing them to elongate, and the lateral meristems cause thickening. So this seems like the correct answer.

Wait, but looking back at option A, Apical tissue. Apical meristems are a type of meristematic tissue. So does that mean A and J are both correct? Or is Apical tissue a broader term? I think Apical tissue refers specifically to the growing tips, while Meristematic tissue is a broader category. The question asks which tissue is responsible for new growth in general, so maybe meristematic is the better answer because it's the general term encompassing all growth areas, not just the tips.

So putting it together, the correct answer should be J: Meristematic tissue.

The correct answer is J: Meristematic tissue.
