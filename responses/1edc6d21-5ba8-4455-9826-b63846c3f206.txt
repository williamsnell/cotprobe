Okay, so I've got this problem about Evans and King who are partners in a copying service. They each invested different amounts, and they made some profit for the year. The question is about how they divided the profits based on their initial investments. Hmm, I think I need to figure out the ratio of their investments and then apply that to the total profit.

Let me start by noting down the numbers. Evans invested $8,500 and King invested $6,500. The total profit is $9,600. So, the first thing I should do is find the ratio of their investments because the profits are divided according to that ratio.

So, Evans's investment is $8,500 and King's is $6,500. To find the ratio, I can divide both by a common factor to simplify it. Let me see, 8,500 and 6,500. Well, both numbers end with 500, so I can divide each by 500. That gives me 17 for Evans and 13 for King. Wait, because 8,500 divided by 500 is 17, and 6,500 divided by 500 is 13. So the ratio is 17:13 between Evans and King.

Now, the total profit is $9,600, which needs to be divided according to this ratio. To do that, I should first find the total number of parts in the ratio. So, 17 parts plus 13 parts equals 30 parts. That means each part is worth 9,600 divided by 30.

Let me calculate that: 9,600 รท 30. Hmm, 30 times 320 is 9,600 because 30*300=9,000 and 30*20=600, so 300+20=320. So each part is $320.

Now, Evans gets 17 parts, so 17 * 320. Let me compute that. 10*320=3,200, 7*320=2,240. So 3,200 + 2,240 = $5,440. That's Evans's share.

King gets 13 parts, so 13 * 320. Let's see: 10*320=3,200, 3*320=960. Adding those gives 3,200 + 960 = $4,160. So King gets $4,160.

Looking at the options, option A says Evans gets $5,440 and King gets $4,160. That matches what I calculated. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Total parts: 17 +13=30. Each part $320. 17*320=5,440, 13*320=4,160. 5,440 +4,160=9,600, which matches the total profit. Yep, that seems right.

I think the answer is A.

The profits are divided based on the ratio of their investments. Evans invested $8,500 and King invested $6,500, simplifying to a 17:13 ratio. The total profit of $9,600 is divided into 30 parts, each worth $320. Evans receives 17 parts ($5,440), and King receives 13 parts ($4,160).

Answer: A
