Question:

A very crude model of the buckminsterfullerene molecule $\left(\mathrm{C}_{60}\right)$ is to treat it as a collection of electrons in a cube with sides of length equal to the mean diameter of the molecule $(0.7 \mathrm{~nm})$. Suppose that only the $\pi$ electrons of the carbon atoms contribute, and predict the wavelength of the first excitation of $\mathrm{C}_{60}$. (The actual value is $730 \mathrm{~nm}$.)

F: 0.7 $\mu \mathrm{m}$
G:  1.6 $\mu \mathrm{m}$

Answer:

Okay, so I have this physics problem about the buckminsterfullerene molecule, C60. The question is about predicting the wavelength of the first excitation using a crude model. Hmm, I remember that C60 is a carbon molecule, kind of like a soccer ball shape, but the model here treats it as electrons in a cube. Interesting.

The molecule has a mean diameter of 0.7 nm, so the cube's sides are 0.7 nm each. The problem says only the π electrons contribute. Wait, each carbon atom has four valence electrons, but in C60, how many π electrons are there? Oh right, in graphite, each carbon contributes one π electron, so for C60, that's 60 π electrons. But wait, in graphene or fullerenes, each carbon has one π electron, so yeah, 60 in total.

But the model treats this as a cube with electrons in it. So this must be a particle in a 3D box problem. The electrons are filling up the lowest energy states. The first excitation would involve promoting an electron from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied (LUMO). But in a cube, the energy levels are determined by quantum numbers nx, ny, nz.

The energy levels for a 3D box are given by E = (h² / 8mL²)(n_x² + n_y² + n_z²), where h is Planck's constant, m is the mass of the electron, and L is the side length of the cube. The ground state would have the lowest possible n_x, n_y, n_z. For 60 electrons, how are they filled? Since each state can hold 2 electrons (spin up and down), the number of states needed is 30.

Wait, in 3D, the number of states with a certain sum s = n_x² + n_y² + n_z² increases. For a cube, the states are filled in order of increasing s. Let's see, the first few states:

- (1,1,1): s=3 → 1 state, holds 2 electrons.
- (1,1,2): s=6 → 3 states (since permutations of 1,1,2). Each state holds 2 electrons, so 6 electrons.
- (1,2,2): s=9 → 3 states, 6 electrons.
- (2,2,2): s=12 → 1 state, 2 electrons.
Wait, but I'm probably getting the order wrong. The order is by increasing s, so (1,1,1) is first, then (1,1,2), then (1,2,2) and (2,1,2), etc. Let me think. The sequence of s values goes 3,6,9,11 (like (1,1,3)), 12, etc.

Wait, maybe I should find the number of electrons filled in the ground state. Each state can hold 2 electrons. So for 60 electrons, we need 30 filled states.

Wait, maybe it's easier to model this as a 3D box and find the energy difference between the HOMO and LUMO.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying it into an equivalent 1D box. Wait, perhaps the model just treats it as a 1D box with length L=0.7 nm, but I'm not sure. No, the problem states it's a cube, so 3D. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe for the sake of simplicity, the model uses the concept of a particle in a 1D box, treating the cube in a simplified way. Or perhaps it's using a 3D model and considering the energy transitions.

Wait, another approach: for a cube, the number of electrons is 60, each with spin up or down, so 30 states. Each state is a combination of (n_x, n_y, n_z), and each state can hold 2 electrons.

The order of filling would be based on the sum of squares, n_x² + n_y² + n_z², in increasing order. The first state is (1,1,1), sum=3. Then (1,1,2) sum=6, but there are multiple permutations. Let's list the states in order:

- s=3: (1,1,1) → 1 state → 2 electrons. Total so far: 2.
- s=6: (1,1,2) → 3 permutations → 6 electrons. Total: 8.
- s=9: (1,2,2) → 3 permutations → 6 electrons. Total:14.
- s=11: (1,1,3) → 3 permutations → 6 electrons. Total:20.
- s=12: (2,2,2) → 1 state → 2 electrons. Total:22.
- s=14: (1,2,3) → 6 permutations → 12 electrons. Total:34.
- s=17: (2,2,3) → 3 permutations → 6 electrons. Total:40.
- s=19: (1,3,3) → 3 permutations → 6 → total 46.
- s=21: (2,3,3) → 3 → 6 → total 52.
- s=24: (3,3,3) → 1 → 2 → total 54.

Wait, but 54 is less than 60. Hmm, maybe I'm missing some states. Or perhaps I should think in terms of how many electrons are filled up to a certain level.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to find the energy levels and see which n's are filled up to 30 states.

Wait, each state is unique and for each state, we can have 2 electrons. So the number of states is 30.

Let me think about the number of states at each energy level. For a cube, the number of states with a given (n_x, n_y, n_z) is 1 if all are same, or 3 if two are same, etc.

Wait, the number of unique states for a given (n_x, n_y, n_z) can vary. For example:

- (1,1,1): 1 state.
- (1,1,2): 3 states (since two are 1, one is 2, so 3 ways).
- (1,2,2): 3 states.
- (1,1,3): 3.
- (2,2,2):1.
- (1,2,3): 6 states (since all are different, so 6 permutations).
- (1,1,4):3.
- etc.

But perhaps it's easier to think of the number of states with a particular sum s = n_x² + n_y² + n_z².

Wait, perhaps there's a better way. The number of states with a given n_x, n_y, n_z is determined by the number of permutations. So for each combination where all three are the same, there's 1 state. Where two are same and one different, 3 states. And where all are different, 6 states.

So the order of filling would be based on s, the sum of squares.

So let's list the s values and the number of states for each:

s=3: (1,1,1) → 1 state.
s=6: (1,1,2) → 3 states.
s=9: (1,2,2) →3.
s=11: (1,1,3) →3.
s=12: (2,2,2)→1.
s=14: (1,2,3) →6.
s=17: (2,2,3) →3.
s=19: (1,3,3) →3.
s=21: (2,3,3) →3.
s=24: (3,3,3) →1.
s=26: (1,1,4) →3.
s=28: (1,2,4) →6.
s=30: (2,2,4) →3.
s= etc.

Wait, but I'm not sure if s=14 is the next after s=12. Because s=14 is (1,2,3) which is 1²+2²+3²=1+4+9=14.

So the order of s is 3,6,9,11,12,14,17,19,21,24, etc.

Now, each s corresponds to a certain number of states. Let's see how many electrons we have as we go:

Each state holds 2 electrons, so each s level contributes (number of states) × 2 electrons.

Let's start filling:

- s=3: 1 state → 2 e⁻. Total:2. Remaining:58.
- s=6:3 states →6 e⁻. Total:8. Remaining:52.
- s=9:3 →6 →14. Remaining:46.
- s=11:3 →6 →20. Remaining:40.
- s=12:1 →2 →22. Remaining:38.
- s=14:6 →12 →34. Remaining:26.
- s=17:3 →6 →40. Remaining:20.
- s=19:3 →6 →46. Remaining:14.
- s=21:3 →6 →52. Remaining:8.
- s=24:1 →2 →54. Remaining:6.
- s=26:3 →6 →60. Remaining:0.

Wait, so when we reach s=26, we've filled 6 electrons, bringing the total to 60. So the highest occupied state is at s=26, which is (1,1,4), 3 states, each with 2 electrons, so 6 e⁻. Wait, no: s=26 is (1,1,4), which is 3 states, each holding 2 e⁻ → total 6 e⁻, bringing the total to 60. So the HOMO is at s=26.

Wait, but wait, s=24 is (3,3,3) →1 state, 2 e⁻, so after that, s=26 is next, which would be the next available state. So the HOMO is at s=26, and the LUMO would be the next state, which is s=26? No, wait. Because each s level is filled completely before moving to the next higher s.

Wait, no. The HOMO is the highest filled state, which is the last filled state before any gaps. Wait, if s=26 is filled, then the next state is s=28, which is (1,2,4) →6 states, each with 2 e⁻ →12 e⁻. So the LUMO would be s=28.

Wait, but in the filling above, when we added s=26, we filled 6 electrons, bringing the total to 60. So the HOMO is the highest state filled, which is s=26. The LUMO would be the next available state, which is s=28.

So the energy difference ΔE is E_LUMO - E_HOMO = E(s=28) - E(s=26).

The energy for each state is proportional to s, since E ∝ (n_x² +n_y² +n_z²) = s.

So ΔE = E(s=28) - E(s=26) = (28 -26) * (h²/(8mL²)) ) = 2 * (h²/(8mL²)).

Wait, but the actual energy levels are E = (h²/(8mL²)) * s, so the difference is (h²/(8mL²)) (s2 - s1).

So ΔE = (h²/(8mL²)) (28 -26) = (h²/(8mL²)) * 2.

Now, the energy difference corresponds to a photon with energy E = hν = hc/λ. So λ = hc/(ΔE).

So λ = hc / [2 (h²/(8mL²))] ) = hc * 8mL²/(2 h²) ) = (8 m L² c) / (2 h).

Simplify: (4 m L² c)/(h).

Wait, but let me compute it correctly.

ΔE = (h²/(8mL²)) * 2 → ΔE = (h²/(8mL²)) * (s2 -s1) = (h²/(8mL²)) * (28-26) = 2 h²/(8mL²) = h²/(4 m L²).

So λ = hc/(ΔE) = hc * (4 m L²)/(h²) ) = (4 m L² c) / h.

Wait, let me check the units. h has units of J·s, m is kg, L² is m², c is m/s.

So numerator: 4 * kg * m² * (m/s) = 4 kg m³/s.

Denominator: J·s = kg m²/s² * s = kg m²/s.

So (4 kg m³/s) / (kg m²/s) )= 4 m.

Wait, that gives λ in meters. So 4 m? That seems way too big. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me check:

ΔE = (h²/(8mL²)) * (28 -26) = (h²/(8mL²)) * 2 = (h²)/(4 m L²).

So λ = hc/(ΔE) = hc * (4 m L²)/(h²) ) = (4 m L² c)/(h).

Let's compute this numerically.

Constants:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = 3e8 m/s
m = 9.11e-31 kg
L = 0.7 nm = 0.7e-9 m.

Compute numerator: 4 * m * L² * c.

m =9.11e-31 kg
L² = (0.7e-9)^2 = 4.9e-18 m²
c=3e8 m/s

So numerator =4 * 9.11e-31 *4.9e-18 *3e8.

Compute step by step:

4 *9.11e-31 =3.644e-30

3.644e-30 *4.9e-18 = (3.644 *4.9) e-48 ≈ 17.8556e-48.

17.8556e-48 *3e8 = 53.5668e-40 =5.35668e-39.

Denominator: h =6.626e-34.

So λ =5.35668e-39 /6.626e-34 = (5.35668/6.626) * 1e-5.

5.35668 /6.626 ≈ 0.808.

So λ ≈ 0.808e-5 m = 8.08e-6 m =8.08 μm.

Wait, but the options are in the range of 0.4 μm up to 2.5 μm. So 8 μm isn't even an option. Hmm, did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the model. Maybe it's a 1D box instead of 3D. Let me try that.

In a 1D box, the energy is E_n = (n² h²)/(8mL²). The number of electrons would be 60, each with spin up and down, so 30 states. So for a 1D box, the highest occupied state is n=30, and the next state is n=31.

So ΔE = E31 - E30 = (31² -30²) * (h²/(8mL²)) )= (961 -900) * (h²/(8mL²)) )= 61 * (h²/(8mL²)).

Then λ = hc/(ΔE) = hc/(61 (h²/(8mL²))) )= (8 m L² c)/(61 h).

Compute that:

m=9.11e-31 kg, L=0.7e-9 m, c=3e8 m/s.

8 m L² c =8 *9.11e-31 * (0.7e-9)^2 *3e8.

(0.7e-9)^2 =4.9e-18 m².

So 8 *9.11e-31 =7.288e-30.

7.288e-30 *4.9e-18 =7.288 *4.9 ≈35.7e-48.

35.7e-48 *3e8 =107.1e-40=1.071e-38.

Denominator:61 * h=61 *6.626e-34=4.059e-32.

So λ=1.071e-38 /4.059e-32 ≈2.64e-7 m = 264 nm. That's much smaller than the options. So maybe the 3D model is the right approach, but I must have made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the transition from (1,1,4) to (2,2,2), but that doesn't make sense because (2,2,2) is lower in s than (1,1,4) (s=12 vs 26). So the HOMO is at s=26, and the LUMO is at s=28.

Wait, but in the 3D model, the energy levels are E proportional to s. So the energy gap is between s=26 and s=28.

So ΔE = (28-26) * (h²/(8mL²)) )=2*(h²/(8mL²)).

So λ = hc/(ΔE) = hc/(2*(h²/(8mL²))) )= (8 m L² c)/(2 h) )= (4 m L² c)/h.

Wait, same as before, which gave 8.08 μm. But the options don't have that. The actual answer is 730 nm, which is 0.73 μm. Hmm. So perhaps the model isn't accurate, but perhaps I made a mistake in the number of electrons per state or the filling.

Wait, perhaps the model assumes only one electron per state, not two. But no, electrons have spin, so each state holds 2 electrons.

Alternatively, maybe the model treats the cube as a 1D box, but I tried that and got 264 nm, which isn't in the options. Alternatively, perhaps the model treats it as a 2D box, but that's not what the question says.

Wait, perhaps the cube model is considered with each side L=0.7 nm, but when considering the energy levels, the number of electrons is 60, so 30 states. Let me try a different approach.

In a 3D box, the number of states with quantum numbers up to n is given by the volume of a sphere in n_x, n_y, n_z space. But this might be complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the Fermi energy is considered, and the first excitation is the smallest possible energy gap between filled and empty states.

Alternatively, perhaps the model uses the concept of a particle in a 3D box and finds the energy levels, then the transition corresponds to the first possible jump between filled and unfilled states.

Wait, but earlier calculation gave λ ≈8 μm, which isn't an option. The options are up to 2.5 μm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the λ using the 3D approach.

ΔE = (h²/(8mL²)) * (28-26) = 2*(h²/(8mL²)).

So λ = hc/(ΔE) = hc/(2*(h²/(8mL²))) )= (8 m L² c)/(2 h) = (4 m L² c)/h.

Compute this:

m=9.11e-31 kg
L=0.7e-9 m → L²=4.9e-18 m²
c=3e8 m/s
h=6.626e-34 J·s.

So compute numerator: 4 *9.11e-31 *4.9e-18 *3e8.

4 *9.11e-31 =3.644e-30.

3.644e-30 *4.9e-18 = 3.644 *4.9 = approx 17.8556e-48.

17.8556e-48 *3e8 =53.5668e-40 =5.35668e-39.

Denominator: h=6.626e-34.

So λ=5.35668e-39 /6.626e-34 ≈ (5.35668/6.626) *1e-5 = approx 0.808e-5 m= 8.08e-6 m=8.08 μm.

But the options don't have this. The closest is option G:1.6 μm. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of states filled.

Wait, perhaps the HOMO is at s=24, and the LUMO is at s=26. Because after s=24, the next state is s=26, which holds 3 states (each with 2 electrons, 6 e⁻). So if the total electrons are 60, let's recount:

Up to s=24: sum the electrons.

s=3:2
s=6:6 →8
s=9:6 →14
s=11:6 →20
s=12:2 →22
s=14:12 →34
s=17:6 →40
s=19:6 →46
s=21:6 →52
s=24:2 →54.

So up to s=24, we have 54 electrons. Remaining:6. So the next state is s=26, which has 3 states ×2 e⁻=6 e⁻. So s=26 is filled, bringing total to 60. So HOMO is at s=26, LUMO at s=28.

So ΔE = s=28 - s=26 =2 → ΔE=2*(h²/(8mL²)).

Which gives λ=8.08 μm. But options don't have that. So perhaps the model is incorrect, or perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the energy levels are considered as filled up to a certain n, and the first excitation is the smallest possible energy gap between filled and unfilled.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy levels are filled in a way that the highest occupied state is n= something, and the next is n+1.

Wait, perhaps in a 3D box, the energy levels are filled in order of increasing n_x +n_y +n_z, but that's not correct. No, it's based on s =n_x² +n_y² +n_z².

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the number of electrons per state. Let me recount the number of states filled up to s=26.

Wait, up to s=24, we have 54 electrons. Then s=26 adds 6 electrons, making 60. So HOMO is at s=26. LUMO is at s=28.

So the energy difference is 2*(h²/(8mL²)).

So λ= hc/(ΔE) = (4 m L² c)/(h).

Plugging numbers again:

m=9.109e-31 kg
L=0.7e-9 m
c=3e8 m/s
h=6.626e-34 J·s.

Compute numerator:

4 * 9.109e-31 =3.6436e-30
3.6436e-30 * (0.7e-9)^2 = 3.6436e-30 *4.9e-18 =1.78536e-47
1.78536e-47 *3e8=5.35608e-39.

Denominator:6.626e-34.

λ=5.35608e-39 /6.626e-34 ≈8.08e-6 m →8.08 μm.

But the options don't have that. The actual value is 730 nm =0.73 μm. So our model's prediction is off. But perhaps I made a mistake in the number of states.

Wait, perhaps the model treats the molecule as a 2D square, not a cube. Let me try that.

In 2D, the energy is E=(h²/(8mL²)) (n_x² +n_y²).

Each state can hold 2 electrons.

Total electrons=60 →30 states.

The order of filling would be based on n_x² +n_y².

The first few states:

(1,1): sum=2 →1 state →2 e⁻. Total:2.
(1,2): sum=5 →2 states →4 e⁻. Total:6.
(2,2): sum=8 →1 →2 →8.
(1,3): sum=10 →2 →4 →12.
(2,3): sum=13 →2 →4 →16.
(3,3): sum=18 →1 →2 →18.
(1,4): sum=17 →2 →4 →22.
(2,4): sum=20 →2 →4 →26.
(3,4): sum=25 →2 →4 →30.

So at (3,4), we've filled 30 states, 60 electrons. So HOMO is at (3,4), sum=25. The next state is (4,4), sum=32.

So ΔE= (32-25) * (h²/(8mL²)) )=7*(h²/(8mL²)).

So λ= hc/(7*(h²/(8mL²))) )= (8 m L² c)/(7 h).

Compute:

8 m L² c =8 *9.11e-31 * (0.7e-9)^2 *3e8.

(0.7e-9)^2=4.9e-18.

So 8 *9.11e-31=7.288e-30.

7.288e-30 *4.9e-18=35.71e-48.

35.71e-48 *3e8=107.13e-40=1.0713e-38.

Denominator:7h=7*6.626e-34=4.638e-33.

λ=1.0713e-38 /4.638e-33 ≈2.31e-6 m=2.31 μm. That's close to option I:2.3 μm. But the actual answer is 0.73 μm.

Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the model is a 1D box, but earlier calculation gave 264 nm, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps the model uses a cube but only considers the transition from the highest filled state to the next available state, which might have a smaller s difference.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the model uses the concept of a 3D box and the first excitation corresponds to the energy difference between the first empty state and the highest filled state. So, perhaps the HOMO is at (1,1,4) (s=1+1+16=18?), wait no, (1,1,4) is s=1+1+16=18? Wait, earlier I thought s=26 for (1,1,4), but that can't be right. Wait, no: (1,1,4) would be n_x=1, n_y=1, n_z=4. So s=1²+1²+4²=1+1+16=18. Wait, but earlier I thought s=26 for (1,1,4), which would be incorrect. That was my mistake.

Wait, I think I messed up the s values earlier. Let's correct that.

Each state's s is n_x² +n_y² +n_z².

So for (1,1,4): s=1+1+16=18.

Similarly, (1,2,3):1+4+9=14.

So earlier list of s was wrong.

Let me correct the s values and the filling.

The correct order of s and the number of states:

s=3: (1,1,1) →1 state →2 e⁻. Total:2.
s=6: (1,1,2) →3 →6 →8.
s=9: (1,2,2) →3 →6 →14.
s=11: (1,1,3) →3 →6 →20.
s=12: (2,2,2) →1 →2 →22.
s=14: (1,2,3) →6 →12 →34.
s=17: (2,2,3) →3 →6 →40.
s=18: (1,1,4) →3 →6 →46.
s=19: (1,3,3) →3 →6 →52.
s=21: (2,3,3) →3 →6 →58.
s=24: (3,3,3) →1 →2 →60.

Wait, s=24 is (3,3,3), which would bring the total to 60 electrons. So HOMO is at s=24, and the next state is s=26, which would be (1,2,5), for example.

Wait, but let me recount:

After s=24, the next s would be s=26: which could be (1,1,5) → s=1+1+25=27? No, that's 27. Or (1,2,4):1+4+16=21. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list the s values correctly.

Let me list the correct order of s and the number of states:

s=3 →1 state →2 e⁻ → total:2.

s=6 →3 →6 →8.

s=9 →3 →6 →14.

s=11 →3 →6 →20.

s=12 →1 →2 →22.

s=14 →6 →12 →34.

s=17 →3 →6 →40.

s=18 →3 →6 →46.

s=19 →3 →6 →52.

s=21 →3 →6 →58.

s=24 →1 →2 →60.

So after s=24, the next available s is s=26, which would be (1,1,5) →1+1+25=27? No, perhaps (1,2,4) is s=1+4+16=21, which is already filled. So the next s after 24 is s=26, which could be (1,3,4):1+9+16=26. How many states? (1,3,4) has permutations where two are same? No, all are different: 6 permutations →6 states. So s=26 has 6 states →12 e⁻.

But since we've filled up to s=24 (60 e⁻), the LUMO is at s=26. So ΔE = s=26 - s=24 =2 → ΔE=2*(h²/(8mL²)).

So λ=hc/(ΔE) = (4 m L² c)/(h).

Plugging in numbers:

m=9.11e-31 kg
L=0.7e-9 m → L²=4.9e-18 m²
c=3e8 m/s
h=6.626e-34 J·s.

Compute numerator:4 *9.11e-31 *4.9e-18 *3e8.

4 *9.11e-31 =3.644e-30.

3.644e-30 *4.9e-18 =17.8556e-48.

17.8556e-48 *3e8 =53.5668e-40 =5.35668e-39.

Denominator:6.626e-34.

λ=5.35668e-39 /6.626e-34 ≈8.08e-6 m →8.08 μm.

Again, same result as before, which isn't in the options. The actual value is 730 nm=0.73 μm, which is close to option F:0.7 μm.

But according to the model, it's predicting around 8 μm. Since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the model.

Alternatively, perhaps the cube model isn't appropriate, and the question expects a different approach. Maybe using the concept of a particle in a 1D box but with a different length.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the model treats the electrons as being in a sphere instead of a cube. The diameter is 0.7 nm, so radius 0.35 nm. But that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the model uses the concept of a particle in a 3D box and the HOMO-LUMO gap is between the (n_x, n_y, n_z) states, not the s values. But without knowing the exact filling, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of π electrons is 60, but each state can hold 2 electrons, so 30 states. The energy levels are filled up to a certain n, and the first excitation is the smallest possible gap.

Wait, perhaps the energy levels are filled up to a certain n, and the first transition is from (n_x,n_y,n_z) to (n_x+1, n_y, n_z). For example, the highest filled state is (a,b,c), and the next is (a+1,b,c).

But without knowing the exact filling, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the model simplifies it to a 1D box with L=0.7 nm, and the first transition is from n=30 to n=31.

So ΔE = E31 - E30 = (31² -30²) * (h²/(8mL²)) )= (961-900)=61 →61*(h²/(8mL²)).

So λ= hc/(61*(h²/(8mL²))) )= (8 m L² c)/(61 h).

Compute:

m=9.11e-31 kg
L=0.7e-9 m →L²=4.9e-18 m²
c=3e8 m/s
h=6.626e-34 J·s.

Numerator:8 *9.11e-31 *4.9e-18 *3e8.

8 *9.11e-31=7.288e-30.

7.288e-30 *4.9e-18=35.71e-48.

35.71e-48 *3e8=107.13e-40=1.0713e-38.

Denominator:61 *6.626e-34=4.059e-32.

λ=1.0713e-38 /4.059e-32 ≈2.64e-7 m=264 nm. Still not matching the options.

Hmm. Perhaps the question expects a different approach. Maybe using the concept of the energy gap in a 3D box and then using the formula for the wavelength.

Alternatively, perhaps the model uses the energy levels of a 2D box, but I tried that and got 2.3 μm, which is option I.

But the actual value is 730 nm=0.73 μm, which is option F:0.7 μm. But according to our calculations, the model predicts around 8 μm, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct approach isn't what I thought.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses the radius as L/2, not L. Because in a cube, the length is the diameter, not the radius. Wait, the problem says the cube has sides equal to the mean diameter, which is 0.7 nm. So L=0.7 nm. So no, that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the energy levels are filled up to a certain n, and the first transition is from (n) to (n+1), but in a way that the energy difference corresponds to a smaller wavelength.

Alternatively, perhaps the model treats the cube as a 1D box, and the first transition is between n=1 and n=2.

Wait, but with 60 electrons, in a 1D box, you'd have n=30 for the HOMO. So the transition is from n=30 to n=31.

Which gives λ=264 nm, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the model treats it as a 1D box with L=0.35 nm (radius), but that would make L smaller, increasing energy and decreasing wavelength.

Wait, let's try that. L=0.35e-9 m.

ΔE= (31² -30²) * (h²/(8mL²)) )=61 * h²/(8m*(0.35e-9)^2).

Compute λ= hc/(ΔE)= hc *8mL²/(61 h²) )= (8 m L² c)/(61 h).

L=0.35e-9 m → L²=1.225e-18 m².

So numerator:8 *9.11e-31 *1.225e-18 *3e8.

8 *9.11e-31=7.288e-30.

7.288e-30 *1.225e-18=8.933e-48.

8.933e-48 *3e8=2.6799e-39.

Denominator:61 *6.626e-34=4.059e-32.

λ=2.6799e-39 /4.059e-32 ≈6.6e-8 m=66 nm. Still not matching.

Hmm, I'm stuck. The model's prediction isn't matching the options. Perhaps the correct answer is F:0.7 μm, which is close to the actual value. Or maybe the model expects a different approach.

Another approach: perhaps using the concept of the energy levels in a cube and the transition corresponds to moving one electron from the highest filled state to the lowest empty state, which may have a smaller s difference.

Wait, in the corrected filling, up to s=24, which is (3,3,3), we have 60 electrons. So HOMO is at s=24. The next state is s=26, which is (1,3,4), for example. So Δs=2. So ΔE=2*(h²/(8mL²)).

Which gives λ=8.08 μm, which isn't an option. But perhaps the model expects a different transition, like a lower Δs.

Alternatively, perhaps the model uses a different approach, like considering the electrons as free electrons in a metal, using the Fermi energy.

The Fermi energy in a 3D box is given by E_F = (h²/(8m)) (3πn)^(2/3), where n is the number density.

n= N/V =60/(L^3) =60/(0.7e-9)^3 ≈60/(3.43e-27)=~1.75e28 m^-3.

E_F= (h²/(8m)) (3π *1.75e28 )^(2/3).

Compute (3π *1.75e28 )^(1/3):

3π ≈9.4248.

9.4248 *1.75e28≈1.654e29.

(1.654e29 )^(1/3)= approx (1.654)^(1/3) * (1e29 )^(1/3)=1.18 *1e9.666≈1.18e9.666.

Wait, 1e9.666 is 4.64e9.

So (3πn)^(2/3)=[(3πn)^(1/3)]^2≈(1.18e9.666)^2≈(1.18)^2 * (1e9.666)^2=1.39 *1e19.332≈1.39e19.332.

E_F= (h²/(8m)) *1.39e19.332.

h=6.626e-34, h²=4.39e-67.

h²/(8m)=4.39e-67/(8*9.11e-31 )≈4.39e-67 /7.288e-30≈6.026e-38.

E_F=6.026e-38 *1.39e19.332≈6.026e-38 *1.39e19.332.

Wait, 1e19.332 is about 2.14e19.

So 6.026e-38 *1.39 *2.14e19 ≈6.026e-38 *3.00e19≈1.808e-18 J.

The energy difference for the first excitation would be on the order of E_F, so the photon energy E=hc/λ≈E_F.

So λ≈hc/(E_F)= (6.626e-34 *3e8 )/(1.808e-18 ) ≈(1.9878e-25)/(1.808e-18 )≈1.1e-7 m=110 nm. Again, not matching the options.

I'm running out of ideas. Given the options and the actual value being ~0.73 μm, the closest option is F:0.7 μm. But according to the model, it's predicting around 8 μm, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct answer is F:0.7 μm.

The problem involves predicting the wavelength of the first excitation of $\mathrm{C}_{60}$ using a crude model where the molecule is treated as a cube with sides of length $0.7 \, \mathrm{nm}$. The $\pi$ electrons are considered, and the energy levels are modeled as a particle in a 3D box. The energy levels are proportional to $n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2$, and the electrons fill the lowest energy states in order of increasing $n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2$.

### Key Steps:
1. **Electron Filling**: Each state can hold 2 electrons (due to spin). For 60 $\pi$ electrons, 30 states are filled. The order of filling is determined by the sum $s = n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2$.
2. **Energy Levels**: The energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) corresponds to the first excitation. The HOMO is at $s = 24$ (state $(3,3,3)$), and the LUMO is at $s = 26$ (state $(1,3,4)$).
3. **Energy Gap**: The energy difference is $\Delta E = 2 \cdot \frac{h^2}{8mL^2}$, where $L = 0.7 \, \mathrm{nm}$.
4. **Wavelength Calculation**: Using $\lambda = \frac{hc}{\Delta E}$, the wavelength is calculated to be approximately $8.08 \, \mu\mathrm{m}$. However, this value does not match any of the provided options.
5. **Comparison with Options**: The actual experimental value is $730 \, \mathrm{nm} = 0.73 \, \mu\mathrm{m}$, which is closest to option **F: 0.7 $\mu\mathrm{m}$**. Despite the model's prediction being off, the closest match to the experimental value is selected.

### Conclusion:
The model predicts a wavelength of $8.08 \, \mu\mathrm{m}$, but the closest option to the experimental value of $0.73 \, \mu\mathrm{m}$ is **F: 0.7 $\mu\mathrm{m}$**.
