Okay, so I've got this question about dynamometers and wattmeters. Hmm, I remember that dynamometers are used to measure power in electrical circuits. They have a moving coil, right?

Wait, the question is about the resistance of the moving coil. I think the moving coil in a wattmeter is part of the circuit where current flows. Oh right, in a wattmeter, there's a current coil and a voltage coil. The current coil carries the main current, and the voltage coil is connected across the voltage source.

So the moving coil, I believe, is the voltage coil. Because in a dynamometer type wattmeter, the moving part is the voltage coil which experiences torque due to the interaction of the two coils. The voltage coil has a high resistance because it's designed to have a small current, which makes sense since it's measuring voltage. If the resistance were low, too much current might flow, which isn't what you want for a voltage measurement.

Wait, but wait. No, the moving coil is the part that moves, so maybe it's the current coil. No, no, I think I got that wrong. Let me think again. The voltage coil is usually the stationary part, and the current coil is the moving part. No, no, wait, I'm confused. 

Wait, in a dynamometer, the moving part is the coil that's attached to the pointer mechanism. The current coil is fixed, and the voltage coil is moving. Or is it the other way around? No, I think the voltage coil is the one that's moving. Because the voltage coil is connected in series with a resistor, and the current coil carries the main current. So the moving coil is the voltage coil, which has a high resistance. Because the current through it is proportional to the voltage, and it's designed to have a small current to produce torque.

So the resistance in the moving coil should be high. That would make the current through it low, which is suitable for measuring voltage without drawing too much current. So the correct answer should be high resistance. Looking at the options, option C is high.

The resistance in the moving coil of a dynamometer wattmeter should be high. This is because the moving coil, which is typically the voltage coil, requires a high resistance to limit the current passing through it, ensuring accurate measurement of voltage without excessive current draw.

Answer: C
