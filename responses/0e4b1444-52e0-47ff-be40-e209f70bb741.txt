Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Pence's assumption regarding people who object to SCNT, specifically when they say SCNT isn't the best for the child. I'm not entirely sure what SCNT stands for, but from context, I think it's a term related to some medical procedure or technology, maybe something like Selective Childbirth or something else. But I'll proceed with that assumption.

The question is asking about Pence's view on why people who oppose SCNT make the claim that it's not the best for the child. The options are A through J, each suggesting different assumptions about the parents' motives.

First, I need to understand the context. Pence, I believe, is a philosopher, so this might be related to his stance on embryo or child-related issues. SCNT might refer to Selective Conglomeration of Nuclear Transfer, which I'm not familiar with, but perhaps it's a term used in debates about embryo selection or genetic modification. Alternatively, it could be a typo, and they might mean SCNT as in somatic cell nuclear transfer, which is a cloning technique. But that's speculative.

Assuming SCNT is a technology used in reproduction or genetics, people who object to it might argue that it's not in the child's best interest. So, the question is about the assumption Pence makes about these objectors' motives.

Looking at the options:

A: Parents prioritize their own needs over the child's. That suggests the parents are selfish.

B: We can't tell the parents' motives. So, it's agnostic about their motives.

C: Parents have ulterior motives. Maybe hidden agendas.

D: Parents have good motives. So, they're acting in the child's best interest.

E: Parents can't make decisions. The assumption is they're incompetent.

F: None of the above. If none fit.

G: Parents are indifferent. So, they don't care much.

H: Parents are uninformed. They don't know what's best.

I: Parents are exploiting the child for personal gain. Like using the child for their own ends.

J: Parents have bad motives. So, their reasons are negative.

Now, I need to recall what Pence's argument is. From what I remember, Pence wrote about the concept of the "child's best interests" in the context of embryo selection. He argues that when parents make decisions about embryos, they might not always have the child's best interests at heart. He suggests that parents could have other motives, such as their own desires or societal expectations, which might conflict with what's truly best for the child.

So, when opponents of SCNT say it's not best for the child, Pence might assume that these opponents are making this claim because they have their own interests (maybe not the child's) in mind. That could mean they have ulterior motives (option C) or that their motives are bad (option J). Alternatively, he might think that the parents are prioritizing their own needs (option A) or have bad motives (J).

Wait, in his essay "The Child's Best Interests," Pence discusses the idea that parents might not always act in their child's best interest because of their own desires. He suggests that the concept of the child's best interests can be a tool for the state to impose its will on parents, rather than a genuine concern for the child. So, when parents object, Pence might be implying that their real motive isn't the child's welfare but their own interests or perhaps a fear of government overreach.

So, if the question is about the assumption Pence makes when people object, he might think that these people are not purely motivated by the child's best interests but have other reasons, perhaps self-serving. That would align with options C (ulterior motives) or J (bad motives). Alternatively, option A suggests prioritizing their own needs, which is similar.

But wait, the options are about the assumption Pence makes about the objectors. If the objectors say SCNT isn't best for the child, Pence might assume that they're not considering the bigger picture or have other motives beyond the child's welfare. So, perhaps he thinks they have ulterior motives—option C. Or maybe he thinks they have bad motives—option J.

Alternatively, I recall that Pence's argument is that the concept of the child's best interests can be used to control parents, implying that some might invoke it not out of genuine concern but to exert control. So, the assumption would be that the objectors have ulterior motives, perhaps to limit reproductive choices or for other reasons beyond the child's welfare.

So, the answer is likely C: The parents have ulterior motives.

The question revolves around Pence's perspective on the motives of those who object to SCNT (likely a technology related to embryo selection or genetic modification) by claiming it's not in the child's best interest. Pence, a philosopher, argues that the concept of the "child's best interests" can be a tool for controlling parents, suggesting that objectors might have motives beyond genuine concern for the child. This aligns with the idea that they have ulterior motives.
