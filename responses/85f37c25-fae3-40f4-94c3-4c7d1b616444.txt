Question:

Which is the smallest asymptotically?

Options:

A: O(n^2)
B: O(sqrt(n))
C: O(1)
D: O(n^1/2)
E: O(2^n)
F: O(log n)
G: O(n)
H: O(n log n)
I: O(n!)
J: O(n^3)

Okay, so I have this question about asymptotic notation, and I need to figure out which option is the smallest asymptotically. Let's see, the options are labeled A to J, each with different big O notations. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that asymptotic notation describes the growth rate of algorithms. The smallest asymptotically would be the one that grows the slowest as n becomes large. So I need to compare these growth rates.

Let me list out all the options with their corresponding growth functions:

A: O(n²)
B: O(√n) → which is the same as O(n^0.5)
C: O(1)
D: O(n^1/2) → same as B, so same as O(√n)
E: O(2^n)
F: O(log n)
G: O(n)
H: O(n log n)
I: O(n!)
J: O(n³)

Wait, so B and D are the same, both are O(√n). So they are tied for that. Now, I need to arrange all of these from smallest to largest asymptotically.

I know that constants are the smallest, then logs, then polynomials, then exponentials, then factorials. So let's see:

- O(1) is a constant, so that's the smallest. So option C is O(1), which is the slowest growing. 

But wait, let me check the others to make sure. Next would be logarithmic functions, which are O(log n), so F is next. Then comes polynomial functions, starting with the lowest exponents. 

So after O(1), which is the smallest, the next is O(log n), then O(√n) (options B and D), then O(n), then O(n log n), then O(n²), then O(n³), then O(2^n), and the largest is O(n!) which grows faster than exponential.

So the order from smallest to largest would be:

C (O(1)) < F (O(log n)) < B/D (O(√n)) < G (O(n)) < H (O(n log n)) < A (O(n²)) < J (O(n³)) < E (O(2^n)) < I (O(n!)).

So the smallest is O(1), which is option C. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Are there any options that are even smaller than O(1)? No, because O(1) is a constant, it doesn't grow at all with n. So yes, C is the smallest asymptotically.

The smallest asymptotic growth is O(1), which is option C.

Answer: C
