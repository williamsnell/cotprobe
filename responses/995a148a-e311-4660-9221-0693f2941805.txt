Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Stevenson's view on the primary use of ethical judgments. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that Stevenson was a philosopher associated with moral relativism or perhaps emotivism. Emotivism is the idea that moral statements are expressions of emotions rather than objective facts. So, when someone says "Killing is wrong," they're not making a factual claim but expressing their disapproval.

The question is asking what Stevenson claims the primary use of ethical judgments is. The options are A to J, so I need to figure out which one aligns with Stevenson's perspective.

Looking at the options:

A: demonstrate superior knowledge. Hmm, Stevenson doesn't think ethical statements are about superior knowledge because they're not factual. So probably not A.

B: provide a basis for legislation. That sounds more like a Utilitarian or maybe a legal perspective, but Stevenson's about emotivism, so B might not be it.

C: evaluate the morality of others. Wait, Stevenson might say that ethical judgments are used to influence others by expressing approval or disapproval, but is evaluating others the primary use? I'm not sure yet.

D: influence the interests of others. That sounds more like a purpose behind making ethical judgments. If you express approval or disapproval, you're trying to influence others' behavior, which aligns with D.

E: state facts. No, because Stevenson doesn't think ethical statements are facts. E is out.

F: establish universal moral laws. Again, that's more of a Kantian or Utilitarian view, not Stevenson's.

G: describe one’s own approval of things. That seems close. Stevenson's emotivism says moral statements describe the speaker's feelings of approval or disapproval. So G could be a contender.

H: express personal beliefs. Similar to G, but perhaps more about beliefs than feelings. Stevenson is about emotions, so G might be better.

I: none of the above. Could be a trap if none of the options fit perfectly.

J: manipulate the emotions of others. That's possible, but Stevenson might see it more as expressing one's own emotions rather than manipulating others'.

Wait, so the primary use: Stevenson's ethical judgments are expressions of approval or disapproval. So they serve to influence others by getting them to approve or disapprove of certain actions. So D says influence the interests of others. Or G says describe one's own approval.

Hmm, maybe the primary use is to express one's own approval, which would be G, but also to influence others, which is D. Which is more primary?

Alternatively, Stevenson's view is that ethical judgments are tools to influence others by making them aware of our approval or disapproval. So the primary use is to influence, which would be D. Or is it just to express feelings, which is G.

Wait, let me think. Stevenson's main point is that moral statements are expressions of attitude, not assertions of fact. So when you say something is wrong, you're expressing disapproval, which is meant to influence others. So the primary use is to influence others, which is D.

Or does Stevenson see it as just describing one's approval (G) without the intent to influence? I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is G because it's about expressing approval, but the primary purpose is to influence, which would be D. So which is it?

Wait, I think Stevenson would say that the primary use is to influence others by expressing approval or disapproval, so D: influence the interests of others.

But wait, another angle: the primary function is to express one's own approval, which is G. Because Stevenson's main point is that moral statements are expressions of emotion, so the primary use is to describe one's own approval. So G could be the answer.

Wait, but the question is about the primary use. So maybe the answer is D, because expressing approval is a means to influence others. So the primary use is to influence their interests.

Alternatively, Stevenson's view is that ethical judgments are expressions of approval, so the primary use is to describe one's own approval (G). Or is it to influence others (D)?

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to recall. Stevenson's book "Ethics and Language" argues that ethical terms are used to express approval or disapproval, and to influence others. So the primary use is to influence others by getting them to approve or disapprove of certain behaviors.

So the answer would be D: influence the interests of others.

Wait, but the option D says "influence the interests of others." Stevenson's point is more about influencing their behavior through expressing approval, which aligns with D. So I think D is the correct answer.

The question asks about Stevenson's view on the primary use of ethical judgments. Stevenson, associated with emotivism, argued that moral statements express emotions like approval or disapproval rather than factual claims. Among the options, D ("influence the interests of others") aligns with his perspective, as ethical judgments are meant to influence others' behavior by shaping their approval or disapproval of actions. While G ("describe one’s own approval of things") is related, the primary purpose is to influence, making D the best choice.

Answer: D
