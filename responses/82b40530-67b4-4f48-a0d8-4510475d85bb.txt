Okay, so I have this question about GARCH models and their criticisms, and how EGARCH models address them. Hmm, I remember that GARCH stands for Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity. It's used in finance to model volatility in time series data. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so let me think through this.

The question lists four criticisms (i to iv) and asks which are overcome by EGARCH. The options are combinations of these points, labeled A to J.

First, I need to understand each criticism.

i) Estimated coefficient values from GARCH models may be negative. Wait, in standard GARCH, the coefficients for lagged squared terms should be positive because they represent the persistence of volatility. If they come out negative, that might be a problem. But wait, I think in standard GARCH, the coefficients are constrained to be positive to ensure the model is well-behaved (like ensuring positivity of variance). So if the question says that the coefficients may be negative, that's a problem. But wait, maybe I'm mixing this up. Oh wait, no—standard GARCH models constrain the coefficients to be positive, so perhaps i is not a criticism but a fact. Or wait, maybe in practice, sometimes the estimates could be negative, which is a problem. I'm not sure. Maybe the issue is that in some cases, GARCH might give negative coefficients, which aren't valid. But I'm a bit confused here.

ii) GARCH models cannot account for leverage effects. I recall that the leverage effect refers to the phenomenon where negative shocks (like bad news) have a more pronounced effect on volatility than positive shocks of the same magnitude. Standard GARCH models assume symmetry, meaning both positive and negative shocks contribute equally to future volatility. So they can't capture the leverage effect because they don't differentiate between the signs of the shocks. EGARCH, on the other hand, models the effect of positive and negative shocks differently, allowing for asymmetric responses. So ii is a valid criticism that EGARCH addresses.

iii) Responsiveness to shocks is symmetric. That's exactly what I just thought. GARCH assumes that both positive and negative shocks have the same impact on future volatility. So yes, iii is a criticism, and EGARCH overcomes it by making the response asymmetric.

iv) GARCH cannot allow feedback from volatility to returns. Wait, feedback from volatility to returns? I thought that GARCH models are about modeling volatility (conditional variance) based on past squared returns or residuals. But some models, like the feedback effect, might imply that volatility affects future returns. Wait, no—GARCH itself doesn't model the returns directly, except through the squared terms. So maybe GARCH doesn't capture feedback from volatility to returns. Or perhaps I'm mixing this up. Alternatively, maybe feedback from returns to volatility is what GARCH does, but feedback from volatility to returns is different. I'm not sure. Wait, another angle: the feedback effect often refers to the idea that high volatility might cause returns to be mean-reverting or something, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps iv is incorrect because GARCH models do allow for feedback in terms of how past volatility affects future volatility, but maybe not the returns themselves. Or maybe iv is talking about the reverse—like, does volatility affect returns? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, let me try to clarify. The question says GARCH cannot allow for feedback from volatility to returns. So if returns are influenced by past volatility, does GARCH capture that? I don't think so. Because GARCH models the variance (volatility squared) as a function of past squared returns and past variances. It doesn't model returns directly. So if there's a feedback where high volatility affects future returns, that's not captured by standard GARCH. But wait, EGARCH also models the same way, perhaps. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the feedback refers to whether higher volatility leads to lower returns or something. I'm not sure. Maybe iv is a criticism that EGARCH doesn't address, or maybe it does. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: some models, like the augmented GARCH or other extensions, might include feedback from volatility to returns, but standard GARCH doesn't. But I'm not sure if EGARCH addresses this. Alternatively, perhaps the feedback from volatility to returns refers to the idea that volatility affects the expected returns, which is captured in some models but not standard GARCH. So if iv is a problem, does EGARCH fix it? I'm not certain. Maybe not directly, but I'm not sure.

So, let's go back to the points.

The question is about which criticisms are addressed by EGARCH.

EGARCH addresses the leverage effect (ii) by allowing asymmetric responses to positive and negative shocks. So ii is a criticism that EGARCH fixes.

EGARCH also addresses the symmetric response (iii) because it allows for different impacts based on the sign of the shock. So iii is fixed.

What about i? The first point says that GARCH models may have negative coefficients. Wait, in standard GARCH, the coefficients for the lagged squared terms are supposed to be positive to ensure the model is stationary and variance is positive. If the estimates come out negative, that's a problem. But I thought that in practice, GARCH models often impose constraints to ensure positivity. So maybe the problem isn't that they may be negative, but that sometimes the estimates might violate this. But I'm not sure if EGARCH solves this. I think EGARCH models also have similar constraints on their coefficients to ensure positivity. So perhaps i is not a criticism that EGARCH addresses, but rather, it's a problem that both models face, but perhaps EGARCH handles it better? Or maybe i is not a problem at all, because models are designed to prevent negative coefficients. So perhaps i is not a valid criticism that EGARCH overcomes.

Alternatively, maybe i is a problem that GARCH can have, and EGARCH somehow solves it. I'm not sure. I think that both GARCH and EGARCH models typically impose constraints on the coefficients to ensure they are positive, so perhaps i isn't a real criticism. So maybe i isn't a problem that EGARCH addresses.

Then, iv: GARCH cannot allow feedback from volatility to returns. I'm not sure if EGARCH addresses this. I think EGARCH focuses on the asymmetric response to shocks, not necessarily on how volatility affects returns. So perhaps iv is not addressed by EGARCH.

So, summarizing:

i) Not addressed by EGARCH.

ii) Addressed.

iii) Addressed.

iv) Not addressed.

So the criticisms that EGARCH overcomes are ii and iii.

Looking at the options:

Option G is (ii) and (iii) only.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: (iii) and (iv) only

B: (i), (iii), and (iv) only

C: (i) and (iii) only

D: (ii), (iii), and (iv) only

E: (i), (ii), and (iii) only

F: (ii) and (iv) only

G: (ii) and (iii) only

H: (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)

I: (i) and (iv) only

J: (i) and (ii) only

So according to my analysis, the correct points are ii and iii, which is option G.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure about iv. Let me think again about iv: "GARCH models cannot allow for a feedback from the volatility to the returns." So, does that mean that volatility affects returns? If so, standard GARCH doesn't model this directly because it's about volatility affecting itself and past squared returns. It doesn't model returns directly. So if the question is about whether GARCH can allow feedback from volatility to returns, then perhaps GARCH doesn't capture that. But does EGARCH address that? I don't think so. EGARCH still models the conditional variance, not the returns. So iv is a criticism that neither GARCH nor EGARCH addresses. So iv isn't overcome by EGARCH.

So, the correct answer is that EGARCH overcomes ii and iii, which is option G.
</think>

The EGARCH model addresses the leverage effect and the symmetric response to shocks, which are valid criticisms of standard GARCH models. It does not address the issue of feedback from volatility to returns.
