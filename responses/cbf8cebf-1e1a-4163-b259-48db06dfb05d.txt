Question:

Mr.Caponiis a butcher who recently raised the price of steak at his market from $1.50 to $2.00 a pound. Correspondingly, his sales dropped from 200 pounds per day to 100 pounds per day. Is the demand for steak?

Options:

A: The demand for steak is constant
B: The demand for steak is elastic
C: The demand for steak is indirectly proportional to price
D: The demand for steak is not affected by price
E: The demand for steak is perfectly elastic
F: The demand for steak is perfectly inelastic
G: The demand for steak is inelastic
H: The demand for steak is determined by the quality
I: The demand for steak is dependent on consumer income levels
J: The demand for steak fluctuates seasonally

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the demand for steak in Mr. Caponi's case is elastic, inelastic, or something else. Let me start by recalling what I know about elasticity in economics. 

Elasticity of demand measures how responsive the quantity demanded is to a change in price. If the price changes and the quantity demanded changes a lot, demand is elastic. If the quantity doesn't change much, it's inelastic. Perfectly elastic means that any price increase would lead to zero quantity demanded, which is rare. Perfectly inelastic means quantity demanded doesn't change at all with price, which also isn't common. But in this case, Mr. Caponi raised the price from $1.50 to $2.00, which is an increase of $0.50, or about a 33% increase (since 0.50 is a third of 1.50). 

Now, looking at the sales, they dropped from 200 pounds to 100 pounds. That's a decrease of 100 pounds, which is a 50% drop. So, the price went up by about 33%, and the quantity sold dropped by 50%. 

To find the price elasticity of demand, I think we use the formula: 

Price Elasticity of Demand (PED) = % Change in Quantity Demanded / % Change in Price.

So, calculating the percentages: 

% Change in Price = (2.00 - 1.50)/1.50 * 100 = (0.50/1.50)*100 ≈ 33.33%.

% Change in Quantity Demanded = (100 - 200)/200 * 100 = (-100/200)*100 = -50%.

So PED = (-50%) / (33.33%) ≈ -1.5. 

The negative sign just indicates that price and quantity demanded are inversely related, which makes sense. The absolute value is 1.5, which is greater than 1. When PED is greater than 1, demand is considered elastic. That means a small change in price leads to a larger change in quantity demanded. 

Wait, but I might be mixing up the terms. Let me double-check. Elastic demand is when the percentage change in quantity is greater than the percentage change in price. So in this case, 50% change in quantity vs. 33% in price, so yes, it's elastic. 

Looking at the options, option B says "The demand for steak is elastic," which fits. 

Other options: A says demand is constant, which doesn't fit because quantity did change. C says indirectly proportional, but elasticity isn't about proportionality in that way; it's about the responsiveness. D says not affected by price, but clearly, price did affect quantity. E is perfectly elastic, which would mean any price increase would lead to zero sales, but here sales only halved, so it's not perfect. F is perfectly inelastic, which would mean no change in quantity despite price change, which isn't the case here. G is inelastic, which would mean quantity didn't change much, but it did change a lot. H and I talk about quality and income, which aren't directly addressed here. J is seasonal fluctuations, which isn't the case here either. 

So the correct answer should be B.

The demand for steak is elastic because the percentage change in quantity demanded (50%) is greater than the percentage change in price (33.33%), indicating elastic demand.

Answer: B
