Question:

Suppose you discovered a new species of bioluminescent worm . How could you prove that it was the worm itself and not some contaminating bacteria that was producing the light ?

Options:

A: Place the worm in a dark environment
B: Measure the light intensity emitted by the worm over time
C: Feed the worm with different food sources
D: Place the light-producing substance in complete growth media or physically examine it under a microscope
E: Perform a chemical analysis of the light-producing substance
F: Expose the worm to high temperatures

Answer:

Okay, so I've got this question about bioluminescent worms and figuring out if the light is coming from the worm itself or some bacteria that might be contaminating it. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

The question is asking how to prove it's the worm producing the light, not bacteria. So, I need to think about methods that can distinguish between the worm and any possible contaminants like bacteria.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Place the worm in a dark environment. Well, dark environment just means no light, so the worm would still produce light if it's bioluminescent. But that doesn't necessarily tell us if it's the worm or bacteria. Bacteria could also be in the dark and produce light if they're bioluminescent. So maybe A isn't the right choice.

Option B: Measure the light intensity over time. Measuring how much light is emitted might tell us about the activity, but again, both the worm and bacteria could emit light. It doesn't directly prove it's the worm. Plus, maybe the worm's light pattern is different from bacteria, but I'm not sure. Not sure if B is the answer.

Option C: Feed the worm different food sources. Changing the diet might affect the worm's growth or bioluminescence, but how does that help? If the light changes, maybe, but that doesn't directly show it's the worm. Plus, what if the food affects the bacteria? Maybe, but not a clear test. So probably not C.

Option D: Place the light-producing substance in complete growth media or physically examine under a microscope. Wait, so this is about isolating the light source. If you take the substance that's producing light and put it in a growth media, you can see if it grows. If it's bacteria, they would grow, but if it's the worm, maybe not. Alternatively, looking under a microscope could show if it's individual cells (bacteria) or something else (worm structures). That makes sense because if it's bacteria, you'd see them multiplying, whereas the worm's own structures wouldn't grow like that. So D seems like a possible correct answer.

Option E: Perform a chemical analysis of the light-producing substance. Chemical analysis could tell us what the substance is. Maybe bacteria produce different compounds than the worm. But without knowing what to look for, it's a bit vague. It might help, but perhaps not as directly as D.

Option F: Expose the worm to high temperatures. High heat might kill both the worm and any bacteria. But that wouldn't directly show who is producing the light. If the light stops, maybe, but it's not conclusive. So F doesn't seem right.

Putting it together, the best way to prove it's the worm is to isolate the light source. Either by growing it in media (if it's bacteria, it'll grow; if it's the worm, maybe not) or by examining under a microscope to see if it's single-celled organisms (bacteria) or something else (worm cells or structures). So option D seems the most appropriate because it directly tests whether the light-producing substance is from bacteria or the worm itself.

To determine whether the light is produced by the worm itself or by contaminating bacteria, the best approach is to isolate and examine the light-producing substance. Placing the substance in complete growth media allows you to observe whether it grows, which would indicate bacteria rather than the worm. Alternatively, physically examining the substance under a microscope can reveal if it consists of single-celled organisms (bacteria) or larger structures associated with the worm. This method directly addresses the question by distinguishing between the two sources of light.

Answer: D
