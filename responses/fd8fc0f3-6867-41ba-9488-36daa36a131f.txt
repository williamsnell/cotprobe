Okay, so I've got this question about corporate law, specifically regarding the removal of directors in a corporation. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says: In the absence of a provision to the contrary in the articles of incorporation, the directors of a corporation elected for a specified term... and then it gives several options about their removal.

First, I need to remember what the default rules are when the articles of incorporation don't specify anything about director removal. I recall that in the absence of specific provisions, the default rules usually come from the corporate laws of the state where the corporation is incorporated. 

Generally, directors in a corporation are elected for a term, which is often set by the articles or by state law. Now, the key point is about their removal. I think that unless the articles say otherwise, directors can be removed, but under what circumstances?

I remember something about "for cause" versus "without cause." For cause would mean the directors have done something wrong, like breached their duty, committed a fraud, etc. Without cause would mean they can be removed even if they haven't done anything wrong, just maybe not performing well or the shareholders don't like them anymore.

So, under default rules, can directors be removed without cause? I think the answer is yes. Because I recall that typically, if the articles don't specify, the shareholders can remove directors with or without cause, provided they follow the proper procedures, like holding a meeting and getting a majority vote.

Wait, but some states might have different rules. For example, some might require cause for removal unless the articles allow otherwise. Or maybe it's the other way around. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Removed with a two-thirds majority. That seems too high; I think it's usually a majority, not two-thirds.

Option B: Removed only if they miss three meetings. That sounds like it's about directors failing to attend meetings, which is a different issue. Not directly about removal.

Option C: Cannot be removed before term ends. That can't be right because directors are typically removable unless the articles say otherwise.

Option D: Removed only by the board, not shareholders. No, because shareholders are the ones who elect and can remove directors.

Option E: Removed with or without cause. This seems plausible because default rules usually allow removal without cause.

Option F: Removed only by court decree. That's not right; the shareholders can remove them without going to court unless there's a dispute.

Option G: Removed by unanimous vote. That's too strict; usually, a majority is sufficient.

Option H: Removed only for cause and after a hearing. This is more restrictive and I think that's when the articles specify, not the default.

Option I: Removed only for cause. This is similar to H but without the hearing part. I'm not sure, but I think default allows removal without cause.

Option J: Removed only if a replacement is identified. That sounds like something specific to certain situations, not the general rule.

So, putting it together, under default, directors can be removed for any reason, with or without cause, as long as the shareholders hold a meeting and get the required majority. The required majority is usually a simple majority unless the articles specify otherwise.

Looking back, the question is about the absence of a provision, so the default applies. So the correct answer would be E: can be removed from office at a meeting of the shareholders, with or without cause.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain because I remember that in some states, the default might require cause unless the articles allow for removal without cause. But I think the general rule is that without any provision, directors can be removed with or without cause, typically by a majority vote at a shareholders' meeting.

So, I think the answer is E.

The correct answer is E: can be removed from office at a meeting of the shareholders, with or without cause. Under the default rules of corporate law, directors can be removed by shareholders without cause unless the articles of incorporation specify otherwise.

Answer: E
