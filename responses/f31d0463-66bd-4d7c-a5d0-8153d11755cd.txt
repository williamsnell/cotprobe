Alright, let's try to figure out this logic problem. So, the question is about identifying a logical fallacy in a given argument. The argument presented is: "We must assume that he is a Communist because he says that he is not, and we know that Communists are taught always to deny party membership."

Hmm, okay, so the structure of the argument seems to be that because someone denies being a Communist, we should assume they are one. That feels a bit counterintuitive, but let's break it down.

First, I need to recall the different logical fallacies mentioned in the options. The options are Argument from Ignorance, Affirming the Consequent, Denying the Antecedent, and Begging the Question.

Starting with the argument structure: If someone is a Communist, they are taught to deny party membership. So, the person says they are not a Communist. The conclusion is that they must be a Communist because they denied it.

Wait, that seems like the opposite of what it should be. If the premise is that Communists deny their membership, then when someone denies it, the conclusion is that they are a Communist. That feels like a contrapositive, but maybe it's a fallacy.

Let me think about each fallacy:

1. **Argument from Ignorance**: This is when someone assumes something is true because they don't have evidence to the contrary. Not sure if that's it here.

2. **Affirming the Consequent**: This is a logical fallacy where if P implies Q, and Q is true, then P is concluded. The structure is: If P, then Q. Q is true, so P must be true. But in our case, the argument is: If someone is a Communist (P), then they deny it (Q). The person denies it (Q), so they must be a Communist (P). So that's exactly Affirming the Consequent.

Wait, but I thought the argument was the other way. Let me check: The actual argument is that because the person denies being a Communist (Q), we assume they are one (P). So yes, it's P→Q, and Q→P, which is the fallacy of Affirming the Consequent.

3. **Denying the Antecedent**: This is when if P implies Q, and not P is true, then not Q is concluded. Not exactly what's happening here.

4. **Begging the Question**: This is assuming what you're trying to prove. The argument here isn't directly assuming the conclusion, but using a flawed implication.

So, putting it together, the argument uses "If P, then Q. Q, therefore P," which is Affirming the Consequent, option B. Alternatively, sometimes this is called the converse fallacy.

Wait, but another angle: The argument might be circular. It assumes that because Communists are taught to deny, so if someone denies, they must be Communist. But that's the same as the conclusion, so maybe it's Begging the Question. Hmm, now I'm confused.

Wait, Begging the Question is when the conclusion is assumed in the premise. In this case, the premise is that Communists deny, and the conclusion is that the denier is a Communist. So it's using the premise to support the conclusion, which might be a form of circular reasoning. But I think Affirming the Consequent is more precise here.

Wait, let me think again. The structure is:

P: He is a Communist.

Q: He denies being a Communist.

The argument is: If P, then Q. And since Q is true (he denies), therefore P must be true.

That's exactly the Affirming the Consequent fallacy. So the answer should be B.

But wait, another way: The argument could be seen as assuming that the only reason someone would deny being a Communist is if they were one. That's a bit of a stretch, but logically, it's Affirming the Consequent.

The argument presented is: "We must assume that he is a Communist because he says that he is not, and we know that Communists are taught always to deny party membership." This structure follows the logical fallacy of **Affirming the Consequent**. 

To break it down:
- If someone is a Communist (P), then they are taught to deny it (Q).
- The argument concludes that because the person denies being a Communist (Q), they must be a Communist (P).

This is a clear example of the fallacy where the consequent (Q) is used to affirm the antecedent (P), even though the truth of Q does not necessarily confirm P. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B

Answer: B
