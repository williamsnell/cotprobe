The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Because of a sudden and unanticipated severe shortage of heating fuel, the President has ordered all offices of federal executive agencies to be open only four days per week. The President's order allows an exception to the extent that emergency circumstances require different hours of operation (as in the case of federal hospitals). When Congress enacted the appropriations statute for operating all federal executive agencies, its members assumed that the offices of those agencies would be open five days per week, but Congress did not include such a requirement in its appropriations statute or in any other statute. Is the President's order constitutional?

Options:

A: No, because the heads of the various executive agencies have final responsibility for the operation of those agencies' offices.
B: No, because when they passed the statute appropriating monies for the operation of executive agencies, members of Congress assumed that those agencies' offices would be open five days per week.
C: Yes, because the Constitution vests the President with plenary authority to direct the administration of all federal agencies in any manner the President deems expedient.
D: Yes, because the order relates to the management of the executive branch and is not prohibited by any statute.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about constitutional law, specifically involving the President's authority and Congress's appropriations. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is that there's a severe shortage of heating fuel, so the President orders all federal executive agency offices to be open only four days a week. There's an exception for emergencies, like federal hospitals. Now, the question is whether this order is constitutional.

First, I remember that the Constitution outlines certain powers between the branches. Congress has legislative power, the President has executive power, and the judiciary has its powers. Here, it's about whether the President can make such an order without violating something in the Constitution.

Looking at the facts, Congress appropriated funds for the agencies assuming they'd be open five days a week. But they didn't include a requirement in the statute. So, the issue is whether the President can change the operational hours beyond what Congress assumed.

I think about the concept of the separation of powers. The President can't spend money beyond what's appropriated by Congress, but can they manage the executive branch in other ways? Congress can't dictate how the President administers the laws unless they have a specific statute. Here, there's no statute requiring five days a week, so the President isn't violating a law by changing it.

Another point is about the President's authority under the Constitution. Article II gives the President the executive power, which includes managing the federal government. So, the President can issue orders regarding the administration of agencies unless Congress has specifically prohibited it through law.

Wait, but isn't there something called the Anti-Deficiency Act? I think that deals with the executive branch not spending beyond appropriations. But in this case, the President isn't changing the budget; they're just changing the operational hours. So that might not apply here.

Option A says no because agency heads have final responsibility. I'm not sure. The President is the head of the executive branch, so perhaps the agency heads are under the President's direction. So maybe A is incorrect because the President can direct the agencies.

Option B says no because Congress assumed five days. But Congress's assumption doesn't make it a legal requirement unless it's in the statute. Since it's not, the President isn't bound by that assumption.

Option C says yes because the President has plenary authority. I've heard that the President has broad authority in administering agencies, but does it include changing operational hours? I'm not sure if it's "plenary" in that sense. Maybe, but I'm not certain.

Option D says yes because it's about management and not prohibited by statute. This seems plausible because without a specific law, the President can manage the executive branch as needed. So D could be correct.

Wait, another angle: the Appropriations Clause in Article I, Section 9, which says that no money can be drawn from the Treasury except through appropriations by law. But here, the President isn't changing the budget; they're changing how the agencies operate within the existing appropriation. So the funds are appropriated, but the operational hours are a matter of how the agencies use their existing budget.

So the President can't spend more, but they can manage within the budget. Therefore, the order is about management and doesn't violate any statute. So D would be correct.

I think I'm leaning towards D as the correct answer.

The President's order is constitutional because it pertains to the management of the executive branch and is not prohibited by any statute. Congress's assumption about the agencies' operating hours does not translate into a legal requirement since it was not included in the appropriations statute or any other law. The President, under the Constitution's grant of executive power, has the authority to direct federal agencies' administration as deemed necessary, provided it does not contravene existing statutes. Here, no statute prohibits the President's action, making the order valid.

Answer: D
