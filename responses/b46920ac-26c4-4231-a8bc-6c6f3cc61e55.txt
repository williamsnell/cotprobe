Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to find the value of N that satisfies the equation (4^(3^3)) divided by ((4^3)^3) equals 2^N. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let me break it down step by step.

First, I should probably simplify both the numerator and the denominator separately. The numerator is 4 raised to the power of (3^3). Let me compute 3^3 first. 3 cubed is 27, right? So the numerator becomes 4^27. 

Now, the denominator is (4^3)^3. Let me compute that. When you raise a power to another power, you multiply the exponents. So 4^3 is 64, and then 64^3, but wait, maybe it's better to handle it as exponents. So (4^3)^3 is 4^(3*3) which is 4^9. Wait, is that right? Because (a^b)^c = a^(b*c). So yeah, 3*3 is 9, so denominator is 4^9.

So now the equation is 4^27 divided by 4^9 equals 2^N. Simplifying that, when you divide exponents with the same base, you subtract the exponents. So 4^(27-9) = 4^18. So 4^18 equals 2^N.

But wait, 4 is 2 squared, right? So 4 is 2^2. So I can rewrite 4^18 as (2^2)^18. Which is 2^(2*18) = 2^36. So now the equation becomes 2^36 = 2^N. Therefore, N must be 36.

Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

1. Compute 3^3: 3*3=9, then 9*3=27. So numerator is 4^27.
2. Denominator: (4^3)^3. 4^3 is 64, but using exponent rules, it's 4^(3*3)=4^9.
3. Divide numerator by denominator: 4^27 /4^9 =4^(27-9)=4^18.
4. Express 4^18 as (2^2)^18 = 2^(2*18)=2^36.
5. So N is 36.

Looking back at the options, option C is 36. So I think the answer is C.

The equation simplifies to 4^18, which is equal to 2^36. Therefore, N is 36.

Answer: C
