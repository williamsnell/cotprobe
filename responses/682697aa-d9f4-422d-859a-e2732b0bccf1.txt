Okay, I've got this economics problem about maximizing profits for Mr. Falbo's factory. Let me try to break it down step by step. So, the question is about hiring the optimal number of men to maximize profit. The data given includes the number of men hired and the total physical product (TPP) in tons per day. Wages are $50 per day, and each ton of output sells for $10. 

First, I remember that profit is calculated as Total Revenue minus Total Cost. So, I need to find both for each number of men and then see where the profit is the highest.

Let me list out the data again to have it clear:

Number of men (L) | Total Physical Product (TPP in tons)
--- | ---
1 | 15
2 | 25
3 | 33
4 | 38
5 | 42

Wages are $50 per man per day. So, the total cost (TC) will be 50 multiplied by the number of men.

The price per ton is $10, so total revenue (TR) is TPP multiplied by 10.

I think I should calculate TR and TC for each L from 1 to 5, then compute profit as TR - TC, and see which L gives the highest profit.

Let me make a table:

For L=1:
TPP =15 tons
TR =15 *10 = $150
TC =1 *50 = $50
Profit =150-50= $100

L=2:
TPP=25
TR=25*10=250
TC=2*50=100
Profit=250-100=150

L=3:
TPP=33
TR=33*10=330
TC=3*50=150
Profit=330-150=180

L=4:
TPP=38
TR=38*10=380
TC=4*50=200
Profit=380-200=180

L=5:
TPP=42
TR=42*10=420
TC=5*50=250
Profit=420-250=170

Hmm, so looking at the profits:

L=1: $100
L=2: $150
L=3: $180
L=4: $180
L=5: $170

So the maximum profit is $180, which occurs at both L=3 and L=4. But the question asks how many men he will hire to maximize profit. Since both 3 and 4 give the same profit, I need to think about whether he would choose one over the other.

Wait, but in economics, firms usually look for the point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Maybe I should check the marginal product and marginal revenue to see where profit is maximized.

Let me calculate marginal product (MP) which is the change in TPP when one more man is hired. MP = TPP(L) - TPP(L-1).

So:

L=1: MP=15 (since it's the first)
L=2: 25-15=10
L=3:33-25=8
L=4:38-33=5
L=5:42-38=4

Marginal Revenue Product (MRP) is MP * price per ton. So MRP = MP * 10.

So:

L=1: MRP=15*10=150
L=2:10*10=100
L=3:8*10=80
L=4:5*10=50
L=5:4*10=40

Marginal Cost (MC) is the cost of hiring one more man, which is $50.

So, the firm should hire workers up to the point where MRP = MC.

Looking at L=1: MRP=150 > MC=50 → hire more.
L=2: MRP=100 >50 → hire more.
L=3: MRP=80>50 → hire more.
L=4: MRP=50=50 → stop here.
L=5: MRP=40<50 → don't hire.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated total profit, both L=3 and L=4 gave the same profit. But according to MRP=MC, the optimal is at L=4 because that's where MRP equals MC. So why does profit not increase beyond L=4?

Because after L=4, the MRP drops below MC, so adding another worker would decrease profit. But at L=3, MRP is 80, which is higher than MC of 50, so it's still profitable to hire the 4th worker because the additional revenue (MRP) exceeds the cost (MC). So, the maximum profit occurs at L=4.

Wait, but earlier calculation showed that at L=3, profit was $180, and same at L=4. So when MRP=MC at L=4, that's the point where adding another worker doesn't increase profit—so the maximum profit is at L=4.

But why is profit the same at L=3 and L=4? Because when moving from L=3 to L=4, the additional MRP (50) equals the additional cost (50), so profit remains the same.

So, the correct number of men to hire is 4 to maximize profit.

To determine how many men Mr. Falbo will hire to maximize profits, we calculate total revenue (TR), total cost (TC), and profit for each number of men. Profit is maximized where total revenue minus total cost is highest. Additionally, the firm should hire workers up to the point where the marginal revenue product (MRP) equals the marginal cost (MC). 

| Number of Men (L) | Total Physical Product (TPP) | Total Revenue (TR) | Total Cost (TC) | Profit (TR - TC) | Marginal Product (MP) | Marginal Revenue Product (MRP) | Marginal Cost (MC) |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------|----------------|-------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------|
| 1                 | 15                           | $150               | $50            | $100              | 15                     | $150                        | $50            |
| 2                 | 25                           | $250               | $100           | $150              | 10                     | $100                        | $50            |
| 3                 | 33                           | $330               | $150           | $180              | 8                      | $80                         | $50            |
| 4                 | 38                           | $380               | $200           | $180              | 5                      | $50                         | $50            |
| 5                 | 42                           | $420               | $250           | $170              | 4                      | $40                         | $50            |

From the table:
- Profit is highest at **L = 3 and L = 4**, both yielding $180.
- The firm should hire workers up to the point where MRP equals MC, which occurs at **L = 4**.

Thus, Mr. Falbo will hire **4 men** to maximize profits.
