Okay, so I've got this question about oncogenes, and I need to figure out what the correct answer is. Let me start by recalling what I know about oncogenes. From what I remember, oncogenes are genes that can potentially cause cancer. They are usually involved in regulating cell growth and division. If something goes wrong with them, like a mutation, they can become overactive or start producing proteins that promote excessive cell growth, leading to cancer.

Looking at the options, I'll go through each one to see which makes sense.

Option A says oncogenes are found only in viruses. Hmm, I don't think that's right. I remember that oncogenes can be found in various places, including the genome of animals. They're actually normal genes that can become oncogenes when mutated. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B says oncogenes prevent cancer cells. Wait, that doesn't sound right. If anything, oncogenes contribute to cancer, not prevent it. So B is likely wrong.

Option C: Oncogenes are a type of immune cell. No, oncogenes are genes, not cells. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Detoxify harmful substances. I don't recall oncogenes being involved in detox. That's more of a liver function or something like that. So D is probably wrong.

Option E: Slow down cell division. Again, if anything, oncogenes speed up cell division, leading to rapid growth, which is cancer. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Produced exclusively by healthy cells. No, because when they become oncogenes, they can be produced by cancer cells as well. So F is wrong.

Option G: Inactive segments of DNA. Wait, oncogenes are active genes that become overactive. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Repair damaged DNA. No, DNA repair is handled by other genes, like the repair genes. Oncogenes aren't about repair. So H is wrong.

Option I: May cause cells to become cancerous. Yes, this sounds right. Oncogenes, when activated, can cause cells to divide uncontrollably, leading to cancer.

Option J: Lead to faster cell death. No, oncogenes make cells live longer, not die faster. So J is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be I. Oncogenes may cause cells to become cancerous.

The correct answer is I.
