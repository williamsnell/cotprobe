Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about Carens and his defense of a form of... something. The options are A through J, each representing a different political or ethical theory. I'm a bit rusty on my political philosophy, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Joseph Carens is a political theorist. He's known for his work in immigration and the ethics of borders. I think he's also associated with cosmopolitanism, which is the idea that individuals and groups should transcend local or national boundaries and consider a larger, more universal community. Cosmopolitans believe in global justice and equality across borders.

Looking at the options, I see several cosmopolitanisms listed, like option B (libertarian cosmopolitanism), E (anarchist cosmopolitanism), H (egalitarian cosmopolitanism), and I (anticosmopolitanism). Wait, option I is actually against cosmopolitanism, so that's probably not it.

I think Carens is more of a liberal or left-leaning thinker. He's critical of strict borders and supports more open immigration policies. His arguments often focus on the moral obligations we have to people outside our borders. So, cosmopolitanism fits here because it's about global concerns.

Now, looking at the types of cosmopolitanism, let's see:

A: Kantian distributionism – I'm not sure, but distributionism usually refers to economic policies about distributing goods, not exactly cosmopolitanism.

B: Libertarian cosmopolitanism – Libertarians emphasize individual freedom and minimal state intervention. I think Carens is more of a left-liberal, so maybe not this.

C: Rawlsian justice – Rawls is about justice as fairness, particularly within a society. His "veil of ignorance" applies to domestic justice, not sure about cosmopolitan aspects.

D: Communitarianism – This is about community and local values, which seems opposite to cosmopolitanism.

E: Anarchist cosmopolitanism – Anarchists oppose all forms of hierarchical authority, including the state. Not sure if Carens is an anarchist, but I think he's more of a socialist or left-liberal.

F: Social contract theory – This is more about the basis of political obligation and state formation, not directly about cosmopolitanism.

G: Libertarian distributionism – Again, more about economic distribution than global ethics.

H: Egalitarian cosmopolitanism – Egalitarianism is about equality, and cosmopolitanism as the global application. This seems plausible because Carens emphasizes equality across borders.

I: Anticommunism – No, that's against cosmopolitanism.

J: Utilitarianism – This is about maximizing overall happiness, which isn't specifically linked to cosmopolitanism.

So, putting it together, Carens defends a form of cosmopolitanism that emphasizes equality globally. Egalitarian cosmopolitanism (H) seems to fit because he argues against the moral arbitrariness of borders and supports a more equal distribution of rights and opportunities worldwide.
