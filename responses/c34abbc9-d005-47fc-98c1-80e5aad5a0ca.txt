Question:

When you drop a ball from rest it accelerates downward at 9.8 m/s^2. If you instead throw it downward assuming no air resistance its acceleration immediately after leaving your hand is

Options:

A: more than 9.8 m/s2
B: less than 9.8 m/s2
C: Greater if the ball is thrown with a force
D: 19.6 m/s2
E: Cannot say unless the speed of throw is given.
F: Dependent on the angle of the throw
G: Not accelerated, it maintains the speed of the throw.
H: Zero, as the ball is in free fall
I: Equal to the speed of the throw
J: 9.8 m/s2

Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let's see. The question is about dropping a ball versus throwing it downward, and how the acceleration compares. Hmm.

Alright, when you drop a ball from rest, it accelerates downward at 9.8 m/s². That makes sense because gravity is pulling it down, and since it's just dropped, there's no initial velocity. Now, the question is, what happens if you throw it downward instead? And it's assuming no air resistance, which is important.

So, I remember that acceleration is all about the net force. When you throw the ball downward, you're applying a force in addition to gravity. But wait, once the ball leaves your hand, what's happening? Oh right, when you release the ball, you're no longer applying a force. So the only force acting on it after you let go is gravity. Wait, but when you throw it, you're giving it an initial velocity downward. Does that affect its acceleration?

I think acceleration is separate from velocity. So even if the ball has a higher initial speed when thrown, once it's in the air, the only acceleration is due to gravity, which is 9.8 m/s². So whether you drop it or throw it, the acceleration should be the same because acceleration depends on the net force, not the initial velocity.

Let me think about the options. Option J says 9.8 m/s². That seems right because the acceleration is still due to gravity. Option A says more than 9.8, but why would that be? Unless there's some other force, but the question says no air resistance, so no. The throw's initial force doesn't change the acceleration once it's moving because that initial force is only during the throw, before release.

Wait, maybe someone might think that throwing it adds to the acceleration because you're applying a force, but no. After you let go, your force isn't acting anymore. So the acceleration is just gravity. So the answer should be J.

When you drop a ball from rest, it accelerates downward at 9.8 m/s² due to gravity. If you throw it downward, the only force acting on the ball after release is gravity, as air resistance is not a factor. The initial force applied when throwing it affects the ball's initial velocity but not its acceleration after release. Therefore, the acceleration remains 9.8 m/s².

Answer: J
