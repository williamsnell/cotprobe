Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Bentham's views on the relationship between morality and theology. I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, who is Bentham? John Stuart Mill's father, right? Wait, no, that's Mill. Oh, wait, Jeremy Bentham is the one associated with Utilitarianism. Yeah, he's the founder of that school of thought. Utilitarianism is all about the greatest good for the greatest number, maximizing happiness, that sort of thing.

The question is about how Bentham relates morality and theology. So I need to remember what Bentham said about the role of God in morality. From what I recall, Bentham was a secular thinker. He didn't base his moral theories on religious principles. Instead, he focused on human reason and the consequences of actions.

Looking at the options:

Option A says God exists but doesn't care about morality. I'm not sure about that. Did Bentham believe in God? I think he was an atheist or at least agnostic, but maybe that's a detail. Alternatively, perhaps he didn't see God as involved in morality.

Option B claims morality aligns with God's will. That sounds more like a religious or deist perspective, not Utilitarian. So probably not B.

Option C suggests God's will can be determined independently of morality. Hmm, not sure. If morality is separate from God, maybe, but Bentham's approach was empirical and based on outcomes, not divine will.

Option D says right and wrong are determined by God's will. That's a theological view, like Divine Command Theory. Bentham probably didn't agree because he focused on human well-being, not divine dictates.

Option E says we must first know if something is right before we can know if it conforms to God's will. This seems like a secular approach where human morality comes first, and then perhaps divine approval is a consequence. That sounds plausible.

Option F is the opposite: know if it conforms to God's will first. That's more theistic, which doesn't fit Bentham's secular views.

Option G says no correlation. That might be too strong. I think Bentham would say morality is based on human reasoning, not on theology, so maybe there's a separation but not necessarily no correlation.

Option H says God doesn't exist. Well, if Bentham was an atheist, this could be true, but the question is about his view on the relationship between morality and theology, not his belief in God.

Option I states morality is independent of God's will. That aligns with a secular view. If morality is based on utility and not divine command, then I could be correct.

Option J says God's will isn't related to morality. Similar to I, but perhaps more about the absence of relation rather than independence. So maybe I is better.

Wait, let me clarify. Bentham's position: he believed that the foundation of morality was the principle of utility, which is about maximizing happiness. He didn't see morality as derived from God's will. So he would argue that morality is independent of theology. So I think option I is correct: morality exists independently of God's will.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option E says we must first know if something is right before knowing if it conforms to God's will. That suggests a priority of morality over theology, implying that morality doesn't depend on God's will. So that could also be a correct interpretation, but which option is more accurate?

Alternatively, option I is a direct statement that morality is independent, which seems to capture Bentham's view better. Because he didn't base morality on divine command but on human well-being.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The question is about what Bentham claims regarding the relationship. So if he's a Utilitarian, he's saying that right and wrong are determined by the consequences in terms of happiness, not by God's will. So the concept of right and wrong isn't tied to God's will. That would make option I correct: morality exists independently of God's will.

Alternatively, option E says we must first determine rightness before knowing if it aligns with God's will. That could imply that morality is separate from theology, which is similar to I. But the wording is about the order of knowledge, not the independence of morality.

So, between E and I. The question is about the relationship. I think I is the more direct answer, stating independence. So I would choose option I.

The correct answer is I: Morality exists independently of God's will.

Answer: I
