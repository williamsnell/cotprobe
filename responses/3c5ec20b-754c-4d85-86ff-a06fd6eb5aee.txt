Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the explosive TNT and the energy it releases. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says that TNT releases about 4.2 x 10^6 joules per kilogram when it burns. The molecular weight of TNT is 227. I need to find two things: the energy released by one molecule of TNT and the fractional change in mass when one kg explodes.

First, let's tackle the energy per molecule. I know that the energy released per kilogram is given, so I can find the energy per mole and then per molecule.

Wait, but TNT's molecular weight is 227 g/mol, right? So one mole of TNT weighs 227 grams. That means 1 kg of TNT would be 1000 grams, so 1000 / 227 ≈ 4.405 moles. Let me calculate that: 1000 / 227 ≈ 4.405 moles.

Each mole has Avogadro's number of molecules, which is 6.022 x 10^23 molecules per mole. So the number of molecules in one kg of TNT would be 4.405 moles * 6.022e23 molecules/mol ≈ 2.653e24 molecules.

But wait, the energy per kg is 4.2e6 J. So the energy per molecule would be total energy divided by the number of molecules. So that's 4.2e6 J / 2.653e24 molecules. Let me compute that: 4.2e6 / 2.653e24 ≈ 1.583e-18 J per molecule. Hmm, that looks like option A, which is 1.58 × 10^-18 J. So that's probably the answer for the first part.

Now, the second part: the fractional change in mass when one kg explodes. I remember Einstein's equation, E=mc², which relates energy to mass. The fractional change would be E/(mc²), where m is the mass. Since the energy released is 4.2e6 J per kg, m is 1 kg.

So the fractional change is (4.2e6 J) / (1 kg * c²). I know the speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s, so c² is 9e16 m²/s². Plugging in, the denominator becomes 1 kg * 9e16 = 9e16 J. So the fractional change is 4.2e6 / 9e16 = 4.666...e-11. Wait, 4.2e6 /9e16 is (4.2/9) * 1e-10, which is 0.4666...e-10, or 4.666e-11. Looking at the options, J is 4.7e-11, which is very close. So J is the answer for the fractional change.

Wait, but I should double-check the units. Energy is in joules, and E=mc², so yes, the units work out because mc² is in joules. So the fractional change is E/(mc²) = (4.2e6 J)/(1 kg * (3e8)^2) = (4.2e6)/(9e16) J²? Wait, no, E is in J, mc² is in J as well. So it's 4.2e6 / 9e16 = 4.666e-11, which is 4.7e-11, so option J.

So putting it together, the energy per molecule is option A and the fractional mass change is option J. But the question asks for two things, but the options are given as A to J. Wait, wait, looking back at the question: It asks, first, the energy released by one molecule, and then the fractional change. But the options don't specify which is which. Wait, no, looking again, the question is phrased as two separate questions: "What is the energy...?" and "What is the fractional change...?" So the options are for each part.

Wait, but looking at the options, each option is a single value. Oh, I see, the options are possible answers for each part. But the way the question is written, it's asking two separate questions. But in the options given, each option is a single value. Wait, perhaps the options are for the fractional change, and the energy per molecule is not an option, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, looking again, the options are a list, and each letter corresponds to an answer.

Wait, perhaps the first part is the energy per molecule, and the second is the fractional change. So the question is two separate questions, but the options are for each. But the way the options are presented, each is a single choice. Hmm, perhaps the question is actually to select both answers, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is structured as two separate questions, each with their own options, but in this case, all options are presented together.

Wait, perhaps the question is to find both values, but each option corresponds to either the energy or the fractional change. But the way the question is written, I think it's two separate questions, and the options are all possible answers for each.

Wait, perhaps the first part is the energy per molecule, which I calculated as ~1.58e-18 J, which is option A. The second part is the fractional change, which is 4.7e-11, which is option J.

So the answers would be A and J, but looking at the options, each letter is an option, so perhaps the question is asking for both, but in the options, each is a separate multiple-choice, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is two separate questions, and the options are for each. But the way it's presented, the options are A-J, each a possible value for one of the two quantities.

Wait, but looking at the options, some are in joules, some in eV, some are fractional. Let me check the options again.

Option A: 1.58e-18 J → probably the energy per molecule.

Option B: 2.3e-12 J → maybe another value.

Option C: 6.5e5 eV → that's a big energy per molecule, but 1eV is about 1.6e-19 J, so 6.5e5 eV is about 1e-13 J, which is higher than my calculation. So that's probably not the energy per molecule.

Option E:5e-9 eV → that's way too small.

Option H: 8.2e-19 J → slightly higher than A.

Option I:9.8 eV → that's about 1.57e-18 J (since 1 eV=1.6e-19 J), so 9.8 eV is 1.568e-18 J, which matches my calculation for the energy per molecule. So option I is 9.8 eV, which is equal to 1.568e-18 J. So 9.8 eV is about 1.58e-18 J, which is option A.

Wait, but I thought the energy per molecule was 1.58e-18 J, which is option A. So option I is 9.8 eV, which is same as 1.58e-18 J. So perhaps both A and I are correct, but the question is to select the energy per molecule, which is A, or the fractional change, which is J.

So, the first part is 1.58e-18 J, which is option A, and the fractional change is 4.7e-11, which is option J.

So the answers are A and J.

The energy released per molecule of TNT is calculated by dividing the total energy per kilogram by the number of molecules in one kilogram. The total energy per kilogram is 4.2 × 10⁶ J, and the number of molecules in one kilogram is approximately 2.653 × 10²⁴. This gives an energy per molecule of approximately 1.58 × 10⁻¹⁸ J, which corresponds to option A.

For the fractional change in mass, Einstein's equation \( E = mc^2 \) is used. The energy released per kilogram is 4.2 × 10⁶ J, and the mass \( m \) is 1 kg. The speed of light \( c \) is 3 × 10⁸ m/s, so \( c^2 = 9 × 10^{16} \, \text{J/kg} \). The fractional change in mass is \( \frac{4.2 × 10^6}{9 × 10^{16}} = 4.7 × 10^{-11} \), which corresponds to option J.

Thus, the energy per molecule is option A, and the fractional change in mass is option J.

Answer: A and J

But since the options are separate, the correct choices are:

Energy per molecule: A  
Fractional change in mass: J  

The final answers are A and J.

However, based on the options provided, each option corresponds to a single value. Therefore, the correct answers are:

Energy released by one molecule: A  
Fractional change in mass: J  

But since the question requires selecting one answer, the primary focus is on the fractional change in mass, which is J.

Answer: J
