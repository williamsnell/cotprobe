<think>
Okay, so I have this question about Kant's philosophy, and I need to figure out the right answer. The question is asking, according to Kant, nothing can be called "good" without qualification except one of the options given. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that Immanuel Kant is a significant philosopher, especially in the realm of ethics. His works, like the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, discuss the concepts of good and evil, and he has a particular take on what constitutes moral worth.

Kant's ethics are deontological, meaning he focuses on the rightness or wrongness of actions based on their adherence to moral rules or duties, rather than the consequences. He talks about the "good will," which I think is central to his moral philosophy. The good will refers to the resolve to act in accordance with moral law, regardless of personal desires or outcomes.

The question is about what can be called "good" without qualification. From what I recall, Kant argues that only a good will is unconditionally good. He distinguishes between things that are good in themselves (good without qualification) and things that are good as means to an end or good only in certain contexts.

Looking at the options:

A: a good will
B: self-interest
C: justice
D: right action
E: good consequences
F: virtue
G: reason
H: happiness
I: pleasure
J: moral duty

I know that for Kant, things like happiness, pleasure, and even virtue (which is more of a consequence or a result) aren't absolutely good. They can be good but are conditional. For example, happiness is only good if it results from a good will. Similarly, self-interest and right action might be good, but they depend on the intentions and the moral principles guiding them.

Moral duty (J) is important, but I think the good will is the only thing that is good without any conditions. Even if an action is done from duty, it's the good will that makes it morally good. So, the good will is the only unqualified good.

So, putting it all together, the answer should be A: a good will.

A

The answer is A: a good will. According to Kant, the only thing that can be called "good" without qualification is a good will, as it is the foundation of moral worth and aligns with his deontological ethical framework.

Answer: A
