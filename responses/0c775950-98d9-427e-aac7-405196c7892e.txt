Question:

An athlete hoped to sign a contract with a professional baseball team to play baseball. He had succeeded in arranging for a tryout at the baseball team's training facilities in a neighboring state. Short on funds and needing a way to get to the training facilities, the athlete approached his friend and said, "If you will drive me to and from the baseball team's training facilities for my tryout and pay for our housing and meal expenses during our stay, I will assign to you 10 percent of my first-year earnings. " The friend agreed and drove the athlete to the training facilities. After the tryout, the baseball team offered the athlete a contract to play baseball for the team at $100,000 per year. When the friend asked when he would be receiving his 10 percent, the athlete replied that $10,000 was much more than the friend deserved and he would pay the friend $1,000 for his efforts. The friend then filed suit to enforce the assignment. If the court holds the assignment unenforceable, the most applicable legal principle would be

Options:

A: the assignment was not in writing, therefore it is not enforceable.
B: a purported assignment of a right expected to arise under a contract not in existence operates only as a promise to assign the right when it arises and as a power to enforce it.
C: the assignment was not fair and reasonable, therefore it can be revoked.
D: the athlete was under duress when making the assignment, rendering it unenforceable.
E: the assignment is unenforceable because the athlete's contract with the baseball team prohibited any assignment of earnings.
F: the friend did not provide a valuable consideration in return for the assignment.
G: an assignment of a right expected to arise from a future event is enforceable once the event occurs.
H: a contract to make a future assignment of a right is not a validly enforceable assignment.
I: the friend did not detrimentally rely on the assignment prior to the attempted revocation of the assignment by the athlete.
J: a gratuitous assignment is revocable, and the right of the assignee is terminated by the assignor's subsequent revocation.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about assignments and why the court might hold it unenforceable. Let me break it down step by step.

The scenario is about an athlete who asked his friend to drive him to a baseball tryout and cover expenses. In return, the athlete promised to give his friend 10% of his first-year earnings. But after the tryout, the athlete got a contract for $100k, and when the friend asked for his 10%, the athlete only offered $1k. Now, the friend is suing, and the court is considering whether the assignment is enforceable.

I remember that assignments involve transferring rights. Here, the athlete is assigning a future right (10% of his earnings) to his friend. So, the key issue is whether this assignment is enforceable.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's unenforceable because it's not in writing. But I'm not sure if a writing is required for such assignments. I think some contracts require writing, but maybe not assignments unless there's a statute involved, like the Statute of Frauds. But I don't think future earnings fall under that.

Option B mentions that a purported assignment of a right expected to arise from a contract not yet in existence operates as a promise to assign when the right arises. So, the athlete's promise to assign 10% is a contract to make a future assignment. I think this relates to whether the assignment is valid before the right exists. So, the friend's agreement would be a contract to assign when the right comes into being.

Option C talks about fairness and reasonableness. If the assignment isn't fair, maybe it can be revoked. But I'm not sure if that's the main issue here. The athlete felt the friend didn't deserve $10k, but the question is about enforceability, not fairness. So maybe C isn't the right choice.

Option D suggests duress. The athlete was short on funds and needed the friend's help. But duress usually involves coercion, and here it seems like a mutual agreement. So D might not apply.

Option E says the assignment is unenforceable because the team's contract prohibits it. I don't know if the baseball contract would have such a clause. The problem doesn't mention any restrictions, so E might not be relevant.

Option F claims the friend didn't provide consideration. Wait, in the scenario, the friend provided a ride and paid expenses. That's definitely consideration. So F seems incorrect.

Option G states that an assignment of a future right is enforceable once the event occurs. That's true, but the issue here is whether the assignment was enforceable before the event. The athlete tried to revoke it after the tryout but before payment. So G might not directly answer why it's unenforceable at that point.

Option H says a contract to assign a future right isn't enforceable. That sounds familiar. I recall that agreements to assign future rights are not considered valid assignments until the right actually exists. So, the athlete's promise was a contract to assign in the future, which isn't enforceable until the right is created.

Option I mentions detrimental reliance. The friend didn't rely on the assignment, so I don't think this applies here. The friend just provided the service as agreed.

Option J says a gratuitous assignment is revocable. But in this case, the athlete offered compensation (10% of earnings), so it's not a gift. Therefore, J isn't applicable.

Putting it together, the main issue is that the assignment was of a right that hadn't yet been earned. The athlete only had a contract offer after the tryout. So, the assignment was a promise to assign a future right, which under the common law isn't enforceable until the right exists. That aligns with option B and H. 

Wait, option H says the contract to assign is not enforceable, while option B explains that the assignment operates as a promise to assign when the right arises. So, the court would likely hold the assignment unenforceable because it's a contract to assign a future right, which isn't valid until the right exists. Therefore, the correct answer is H.

The court would likely hold the assignment unenforceable because it is a contract to assign a right that arises from a future event (the athlete earning money from the baseball contract). Under common law, such a contract to assign a future right is not enforceable until the right actually exists. 

Answer: H
