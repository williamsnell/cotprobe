Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the power needed to lift liquid using an air pump. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the problem states that we're moving 12 gallons per minute of a liquid with a specific gravity of 1.3. The pump is an air pump, and it's getting air at 55 psig. We need to lift the liquid 75 feet, and the pump efficiency is 30%. The question is asking for the power needed using isentropic air compression.

Alright, let's start by understanding the basic formula for power in a pump. I remember that power (P) is related to the work done, which involves the flow rate (Q), the pressure (P), and the efficiency (η). The formula I think is P = (Q * P) / (η * 60), where Q is in gallons per minute and P is in psi. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because sometimes units can be tricky.

Wait, no, maybe that's for pressure in a different unit. Oh right, sometimes the formula uses horsepower, so perhaps I need to convert units properly.

But wait, the pump here is an air pump, not a direct displacement pump. So maybe I need to consider the pressure required to lift the liquid to 75 feet. Because the pump is using air to lift the liquid, the pressure of the air will determine how high the liquid can be lifted.

So, the pressure needed to lift the liquid can be calculated using the hydrostatic pressure formula. Hydrostatic pressure (in psi) is equal to the height (in feet) multiplied by the specific gravity of the liquid and then divided by 2.31, since 2.31 feet of water is equivalent to 1 psi.

So, let's compute that. Height is 75 ft, specific gravity is 1.3. So pressure P = (75 ft * 1.3) / 2.31. Let me calculate that: 75 * 1.3 is 97.5. Divided by 2.31 gives approximately 42.21 psi. So the pressure needed is about 42.21 psi.

But wait, the pump is getting air at 55 psig. Hmm, so the pump can supply 55 psi. But since the required pressure is about 42 psi, that's less than what the pump can provide. So perhaps the pump doesn't need to operate at full capacity, but I'm not sure if that plays into the calculation directly.

Wait, the problem says the pump is using isentropic air compression. So I think I need to calculate the work done during isentropic compression and then find the power required, considering the pump efficiency.

Wait, but maybe I should approach this differently. The pump is moving the liquid by compressing air, which then lifts the liquid. The energy required is for lifting the liquid against gravity, plus the energy needed to compress the air.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is assuming that the work done by the pump is just overcoming the pressure needed to lift the liquid, considering the pump efficiency. So maybe the pressure required is 42.21 psi, and the pump is delivering that pressure at a certain flow rate, while operating at 55 psig.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The pump's job is to push the liquid up 75 feet. The power needed would be based on the work done to lift the liquid and the efficiency of the pump.

Wait, but the pump is an air pump, so perhaps the power is calculated based on the compressed air's pressure and the flow rate.

Alternatively, maybe the approach is to calculate the required power based on the head (pressure) and the flow rate, then adjust for efficiency.

Let me try that. So the head (H) in feet is 75 ft. The specific gravity (SG) is 1.3, so the pressure needed is H * SG / 2.31, which we already calculated as ~42.21 psi.

The flow rate (Q) is 12 gallons per minute. Now, to find the power, I think the formula is:

Power (HP) = (Q * H * SG) / (1714 * η)

Where 1714 comes from converting units: 1 HP = 33,000 ft-lbf/min, and 1 gallon of water weighs about 8.34 lb, so for specific gravity 1, 1 gallon is 8.34 lb. But with specific gravity, it's 1.3 times that.

Wait, let me make sure I get the units right. The formula I'm thinking of for power in horsepower is:

HP = (GPM * Head in feet * Specific Gravity) / (1714 * Efficiency)

So plugging in the numbers:

Q = 12 gpm
H = 75 ft
SG = 1.3
Efficiency η = 0.3

So, HP = (12 * 75 * 1.3) / (1714 * 0.3)

Let me compute the numerator: 12 *75 = 900; 900 *1.3 =1170.

Denominator: 1714 *0.3 =514.2.

So HP = 1170 / 514.2 ≈ 2.275 HP.

Wait, but that's about 2.28 HP. Looking at the options, the closest is option A: 2.0 hp and F:2.5 hp. Hmm, but that's not matching exactly. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I should check the formula again. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the pump is an air pump, so I need to calculate the work done in compressing the air to lift the liquid.

Alternatively, perhaps the pressure required is 42.21 psi, and the pump is delivering that pressure at a flow rate of 12 gpm. Then, using the formula for power in horsepower: (gpm * psi) / (1714 * efficiency).

Wait, that might be a better approach. So, with Q =12 gpm, P =42.21 psi.

So HP = (12 * 42.21) / (1714 * 0.3)

Let's compute that:

12 *42.21 = 506.52

1714 *0.3 =514.2

506.52 /514.2 ≈ 0.985 HP.

That's approximately 0.99 HP, which rounds to about 1.0 HP. Looking at the options, option J is 1.0 hp. But wait, earlier method gave me ~2.28 HP. So which approach is correct?

Wait, perhaps the first approach was wrong because it's using head and specific gravity without considering that the pump is air-driven, so the pressure is what's lifting the liquid, not the head directly. Alternatively, maybe the correct method is to calculate the pressure required and then compute power based on that.

Wait, let me think again. The pump is delivering air at a certain pressure, which then lifts the liquid. The work done by the pump is to raise the liquid to a certain height, which requires a certain pressure, and then the power is based on the flow rate and pressure, adjusted for efficiency.

So, the pressure required to lift the liquid is 42.21 psi. The pump is supplying that pressure, so the power in horsepower can be calculated using the formula:

HP = (gpm * psi) / (1714 * efficiency)

So, substituting:

HP = (12 *42.21)/(1714 * 0.3)

Which as I calculated earlier is about 0.985 HP, which is approximately 1.0 HP, so option J.

But wait, the initial method gave me 2.28 HP, which is higher. So why the discrepancy?

Ah, perhaps because in the first approach, I used the head in feet and specific gravity, which is correct for a centrifugal pump, but in this case, the pump is an air pump, which uses pressure to lift the liquid. So the correct approach is to calculate based on the pressure required, which is 42.21 psi, and then compute the power based on that.

So the second approach gives me ~1.0 HP, which is option J.

Wait, but the initial approach gave me 2.28 HP when considering the head and flow rate, but perhaps that's incorrect because the pump isn't directly lifting the liquid via a centrifugal method but via compressed air.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the pump is compressing air to a certain pressure, and the work done in compressing the air is what's being used to lift the liquid.

But I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.

The pump's job is to push the liquid up 75 feet. The pressure needed to do that is 42.21 psi. The pump is delivering air at 55 psig, but the required pressure is lower, so maybe the pump isn't fully utilizing its capacity. Alternatively, perhaps the pump is working at the required pressure, and the power is based on that.

Wait, another thought: sometimes in pumping, the power is calculated using the formula P = (Q * H) / (efficiency * 33,000), where H is in feet of liquid. But with specific gravity, H would be 75 ft multiplied by 1.3, giving 97.5 ft of water. Then, the power would be (gpm * ft of head) / (efficiency * 33,000) in horsepower.

So, using that formula:

HP = (12 * 97.5) / (0.3 * 33,000)

Compute numerator: 12 *97.5 = 1170

Denominator: 0.3 *33000=9900

HP=1170 /9900≈0.118 HP. That can't be right because it's too low. Wait, that seems off.

Wait, no, perhaps I missed a unit conversion. Let me check: the formula is sometimes written as HP = (gpm * head in ft * SG) / (efficiency * 1714). Because 1 HP is 33,000 ft-lbf per minute, and each gallon of water weighs 8.34 lbs, so for SG=1, each gallon is 8.34 lb, but for SG=1.3, it's 1.3*8.34=10.842 lb per gallon.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is HP = (Q * H * SG) / (efficiency * 1714)

So, Q=12 gpm, H=75 ft, SG=1.3, η=0.3.

So, HP = (12 *75 *1.3) / (0.3 *1714)

Compute numerator: 12 *75=900; 900 *1.3=1170.

Denominator: 0.3 *1714=514.2.

So HP=1170 /514.2≈2.275 HP, which is about 2.3 HP. So the closest option is A:2.0 hp or F:2.5 hp. Hmm, but that's not matching the other approach.

Wait, but earlier when I used pressure, I got 1 HP, which is option J. So I'm getting conflicting results with two different methods.

I think I need to figure out which approach is correct. The problem states it's an air pump, so perhaps the correct approach is to use the pressure required and the flow rate to compute the power, considering efficiency.

Wait, another angle: the power required to lift the liquid is equal to the work done per unit time. The work done is the weight of the liquid lifted multiplied by the height. So, weight flow rate (lbs/min) times height (ft) gives the work in ft-lbf per minute, which can then be converted to horsepower.

So, let's compute the weight flow rate. The liquid is 12 gpm, and specific gravity is 1.3, so the weight is 12 gpm * 1.3 * 8.34 lb/gal = 12 *1.3 *8.34.

Wait, let me compute that: 12 *1.3=15.6 gpm. 15.6 *8.34 ≈130.584 lb per minute.

So the weight flow rate is ~130.584 lbs/min.

Now, the work done is weight * height: 130.584 lb/min *75 ft = 9793.8 ft-lbf per minute.

Now, convert that to horsepower: 9793.8 / 33,000 ≈0.297 HP. But this is the ideal power without considering pump efficiency.

Since the pump is only 30% efficient, the actual power needed is 0.297 /0.3 ≈0.99 HP, which is about 1.0 HP. So option J.

Wait, that's consistent with the earlier approach where I used the pressure method. So perhaps the correct answer is 1.0 HP, option J.

But earlier, using the head method, I got around 2.28 HP. So which approach is correct?

I think the confusion arises from whether the pump is a centrifugal pump or a positive displacement pump. In this case, it's an air pump, which is likely a type of positive displacement pump or using compressed air, so the work done is based on the pressure required to lift the liquid, not the head in feet.

So, using the weight flow rate method gives me ~1.0 HP, which matches the pressure-based calculation.

Therefore, the correct answer is 1.0 HP, option J.

To determine the power needed to lift 12 gal/min of a liquid with a specific gravity of 1.3 using an air pump, we first calculate the pressure required to lift the liquid to a height of 75 ft. Using the hydrostatic pressure formula:

\[
P = \frac{H \cdot SG}{2.31} = \frac{75 \cdot 1.3}{2.31} \approx 42.21 \, \text{psi}.
\]

Next, we calculate the power required to deliver this pressure at a flow rate of 12 gal/min, considering the pump efficiency of 30%. The formula for power in horsepower is:

\[
\text{HP} = \frac{Q \cdot P}{1714 \cdot \eta},
\]

where \( Q = 12 \, \text{gpm} \), \( P = 42.21 \, \text{psi} \), and \( \eta = 0.3 \). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{HP} = \frac{12 \cdot 42.21}{1714 \cdot 0.3} \approx \frac{506.52}{514.2} \approx 0.985 \, \text{HP}.
\]

This rounds to approximately \( 1.0 \, \text{HP} \). Thus, the correct answer is:
