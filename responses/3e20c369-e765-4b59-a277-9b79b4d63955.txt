Okay, so I've got this combinatorics problem here, and I need to find the sum of all integers k such that the combination of 23 choose 4 plus 23 choose 5 equals 24 choose k. The options are given from A to J, and I have to pick the correct one. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that there's a property of combinations where the sum of two combinations can be expressed as another combination. Specifically, the identity is that C(n, k) + C(n, k+1) = C(n+1, k+1). Wait, let me make sure I have that right. So if I have C(n, r) + C(n, r+1), that equals C(n+1, r+1). Is that correct? Let me think of a small example to verify.

Take n=2, r=1. Then C(2,1) is 2, C(2,2) is 1. Their sum is 3. And C(3,2) is 3. Yep, that works. So the identity holds. So in this problem, we have C(23,4) + C(23,5). According to the identity, this should equal C(24,5), because n is 23, r is 4, so n+1 is 24, r+1 is 5.

So that means C(23,4) + C(23,5) = C(24,5). Therefore, k must be 5. But wait, the question says "the sum of all integers k" such that this equation holds. So is there only one k, which is 5, or are there multiple ks?

Wait, combinations have a symmetry property. That is, C(n, k) = C(n, n−k). So C(24,5) is equal to C(24, 24−5) = C(24,19). So that means if k=5 is a solution, then k=19 is also a solution because C(24,5)=C(24,19). So the equation holds for k=5 and k=19. 

Therefore, the integers k are 5 and 19. The question asks for the sum of all such integers k. So 5 + 19 equals 24. Let me double-check that. 5 plus 19 is indeed 24.

Looking back at the options provided, option F is 24. So the correct answer should be F.

The sum of all integers k is 5 + 19 = 24.

Answer: F
