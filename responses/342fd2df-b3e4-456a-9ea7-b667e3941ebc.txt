Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about secondary research. Let me think through this step by step. 

The question is asking which activity might secondary research involve. The options are A through I, each representing a different activity. I remember that research can be categorized into primary and secondary. Primary research is when you go out and collect data yourself, like conducting experiments, surveys, interviews, or observations. Secondary research, on the other hand, involves using data that's already been collected by others. So, it's more about reviewing and analyzing existing information rather than gathering new data.

Let me go through each option one by one to see which fits secondary research.

Option A: Examining public records. Public records are existing documents, so this sounds like something secondary research would involve. You're looking at data that's already been collected, maybe for legal or historical purposes.

Option B: Observing people. Observation usually happens in primary research, like in field studies or experiments where you're directly watching and noting behaviors. So B is probably primary.

Option C: Writing a novel. That's a creative activity, not research at all. So C is out.

Option D: Conducting a scientific experiment. Experiments are hands-on and part of primary research because you're testing hypotheses and collecting new data. So D is primary.

Option E: Conducting a survey. Surveys are a primary method because you're directly collecting responses from people. So E is primary.

Option F: Interviewing people. Interviews are another primary method since you're gathering new information directly from individuals. So F is primary.

Option G: Collecting soil samples. That's fieldwork, primary research. You're gathering physical samples to analyze, so G is primary.

Option H: Coding a computer program. Unless the program is part of data analysis in secondary research, but generally, coding is a separate skill and not directly a research activity. Maybe, but I'm not sure. It might be more about the data processing, which could be part of either, but I'm leaning towards it not being the main activity for secondary research.

Option I: Designing a building. That's an architectural task, not research. So I is out.

So among the options, A seems to fit secondary research because it's about using existing records. The other options are either primary research activities or unrelated. Therefore, the answer should be A.
