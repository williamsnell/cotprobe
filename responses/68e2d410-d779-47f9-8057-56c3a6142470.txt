Question:

A large data set contains information about all students majoring in computer science in colleges across the United States. The data set contains the following information about each student.
   ° The student's gender
   ° The state in which the student attends college
   ° The student's grade point average on a 4.0 scale

 Which of the following questions could be answered by analyzing only information in the data set?

Options:

A: What is the percentage of students majoring in computer science who also participate in sports?
B: How many states have a higher percentage of female computer science majors than male computer science majors attending college in that state?
C: Do students majoring in computer science tend to have higher grade point averages than students majoring in other subjects?
D: What is the average age of students majoring in computer science?
E: What is the most common second major for students majoring in computer science?
F: Which college has the highest number of students majoring in computer science?
G: What percent of computer science majors receive financial aid?
H: What percent of students attending college in a certain state are majoring in computer science?

Okay, so I've got this question about a dataset and which question can be answered using only the information in that dataset. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The dataset contains information about all computer science students in U.S. colleges. For each student, we know their gender, the state where they attend college, and their GPA on a 4.0 scale. That's the data we have.

Now, I need to look at each option and see if the question can be answered using only that information. I'll go through them one by one.

Option A: What is the percentage of students majoring in computer science who also participate in sports? Hmm, the dataset doesn't mention anything about sports participation. So we can't answer this because the data doesn't include that information. So A is out.

Option B: How many states have a higher percentage of female computer science majors than male in that state. Wait, let's think. The dataset has gender and state. So for each state, we can count the number of female and male CS majors. Then calculate the percentage of each in that state. Then compare female to male percentages per state and count how many states have female higher than male. So yes, B can be answered with the given data.

Option C: Do CS students have higher GPA than students in other subjects? Oh, wait, the dataset only includes CS students. There's no data on other subjects' students, so we can't compare. So C is out.

Option D: Average age of CS students. The dataset doesn't have age information. GPA, gender, state—no age. So D can't be answered.

Option E: Most common second major for CS students. The dataset doesn't mention second majors, so E is out.

Option F: Which college has the highest number of CS majors. The dataset includes the state, but not the specific college. So we can't determine which college has the highest; we can only see state-level data. So F is out.

Option G: Percent of CS majors receiving financial aid. The dataset doesn't include financial aid information, so G is out.

Option H: What percent of students in a certain state are CS majors. So the dataset has state and major. For a specific state, we can count the number of CS majors and the total number of students in that state (from the dataset). But wait, the dataset only includes CS students. So if I want the percentage of CS majors in a state, I need the total number of students in that state, which isn't provided. Because the dataset only has CS students, we don't know how many total students are in each state. So H can't be answered because we don't have the denominator (total students per state). Wait, unless we assume the dataset includes all students, but the question says it's about CS majors. So H is out.

Wait, let me recheck. The dataset is about all CS majors, so for each state, the number of CS majors is known. But to find the percentage of CS majors in the state's total students, we need the state's total student count, which isn't in the dataset. So H can't be answered.

So the only answer is B. Let me double-check B. For each state, count females and males. Calculate their percentages in that state. Then compare. Yes, that's possible with the data.

The correct answer is B. The dataset contains gender and state information, allowing us to determine the percentage of female and male computer science majors in each state and compare them.
