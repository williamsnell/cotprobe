Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, I've got this calculus problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking. The function is z = arctan(e^{1 + (1 + x)^2}), and I need to find the derivative of z with respect to x at x=0. Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to compute the derivative dz/dx and then evaluate it at x=0.

First, I remember that the derivative of arctan(u) with respect to x is (1/(1 + u²)) * du/dx. So, u here is e^{1 + (1 + x)^2}. So, I'll need to apply the chain rule here.

Let me break it down step by step.

So, z = arctan(u), where u = e^{v}, and v = 1 + (1 + x)^2. So, first, I'll find the derivative of z with respect to u, then u with respect to v, and then v with respect to x.

Starting with dz/du: that's 1/(1 + u²).

Next, du/dv: the derivative of e^v with respect to v is e^v.

Then, dv/dx: v is 1 + (1 + x)^2. The derivative of that with respect to x is 2*(1 + x). Because the derivative of (1+x)^2 is 2*(1+x)*1, since the derivative of (1+x) is 1.

So putting it all together, dz/dx = (1/(1 + u²)) * e^v * 2*(1 + x).

Now, let's substitute back in terms of x. Remember that v = 1 + (1 + x)^2, so u = e^{v} = e^{1 + (1 + x)^2}.

But wait, when x=0, let's compute each part. Let's first find the value at x=0.

At x=0, 1 + x = 1, so (1+x)^2 = 1. Then v = 1 + 1 = 2. So u = e^2. The value of u at x=0 is e².

So, let's compute each term at x=0.

First, dz/du at u=e² is 1/(1 + (e²)^2) = 1/(1 + e^4).

Then, du/dv at v=2 is e², since u = e^v and v=2 at x=0.

Next, dv/dx at x=0: 2*(1 + 0) = 2*1=2.

So, putting it all together, dz/dx at x=0 is [1/(1 + e^4)] * e² * 2.

Wait, that simplifies to (2 e²)/(1 + e^4).

Now, let's compute this numerically. Let's calculate e² and e^4.

We know that e is approximately 2.71828.

e² ≈ 7.38906.

e^4 = (e²)^2 ≈ 7.38906^2 ≈ 54.59815.

So, 1 + e^4 ≈ 1 + 54.59815 = 55.59815.

Now, 2 e² ≈ 2 * 7.38906 ≈ 14.77812.

So, dz/dx at x=0 is 14.77812 / 55.59815 ≈ let's compute that.

Dividing 14.77812 by 55.59815.

Hmm, 14.77812 ÷ 55.59815.

Well, 55.59815 goes into 14.77812 about 0.265 times? Let me check more accurately.

Let me compute 14.77812 / 55.59815.

Let me compute 55.59815 * 0.265 = ?

55.59815 * 0.2 = 11.11963

55.59815 * 0.06 = 3.33589

55.59815 * 0.005=0.27799

Adding those: 11.11963 +3.33589=14.45552, plus 0.27799=14.73351.

So, 55.59815 * 0.265 ≈14.73351, which is just a bit less than 14.77812.

The difference is 14.77812 -14.73351=0.04461.

So, how much more beyond 0.265 do we need?

Each 0.001 of the multiplier adds 55.59815 * 0.001 ≈0.055598 to the product.

So, 0.04461 / 0.055598 ≈ 0.8.

So, approximately 0.265 + 0.0008 ≈0.2658.

Wait, but wait, perhaps it's better to compute it more accurately using a calculator approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute 14.77812 /55.59815.

Let me write it as:

55.59815 ) 14.77812

Since 55.59815 is about 55.6, and 14.78 divided by 55.6.

Well, 55.6 * 0.265 ≈14.733, as before.

So, 0.265 gives 14.733, so 14.778 is 0.045 higher.

0.045 /55.6 ≈0.00081.

So, total is approximately 0.2658.

So, about 0.2658.

Wait, but looking at the options given, the choices are all around 0.2 to 0.7, but the options are A:0.4752, B:0.6210, etc. Hmm, none of the options are close to 0.265. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, let me double-check my steps.

Wait, I think I might have missed a step in substitution. Let me go through the derivative again.

z = arctan(e^{1 + (1+x)^2})

So, dz/dx = (1/(1 + [e^{1 + (1+x)^2}]^2)) * d/dx [e^{1 + (1+x)^2}]

Then, d/dx [e^{1 + (1+x)^2}] = e^{1 + (1+x)^2} * d/dx [1 + (1+x)^2]

Which is e^{v} * 2(1+x), where v=1 + (1+x)^2.

So, dz/dx = [1/(1 + (e^{v})^2)] * e^v * 2(1+x)

At x=0, v=1 + (1+0)^2=1+1=2, so e^v = e^2.

Thus, dz/dx at x=0 is [1/(1 + e^{4})] * e^2 * 2*(1+0) = [1/(1+e^4)] * 2e^2.

So, yes, that's correct. So, 2e²/(1+e^4).

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

Compute e²: approximately 7.389056099.

Compute e^4: (e²)^2 = (7.389056099)^2 ≈ 54.59815003.

So, 1 + e^4 ≈55.59815003.

2e²≈2*7.389056099≈14.778112198.

So, 14.778112198 /55.59815003 ≈ Let's compute that.

Using a calculator, 14.778112198 ÷55.59815003= approximately 0.2657.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them are around 0.26. The options are:

A: 0.4752

B: 0.6210

C: 0.4123

D: 0.5678

E: 0.5439

F: 0.2896

G: 0.3017

H: 0.1345

I: 0.6571

J: 0.2198

Hmm, the closest option is F:0.2896, but 0.2657 is closer to F (0.2896) than to J (0.2198), but it's still not matching exactly. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the derivative. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I missed a term in the chain rule. Let me re-derive the derivative.

z = arctan(u), u = e^{v}, v = 1 + (1+x)^2.

dz/dx = (1/(1 + u²)) * du/dx.

du/dx = e^v * dv/dx.

dv/dx = 2*(1+x).

So, yes, that's correct.

So, dz/dx = (1/(1 + e^{2v})) * e^v * 2*(1+x).

Wait, wait, because u = e^v, so u² = e^{2v}.

So, 1/(1 + u²) = 1/(1 + e^{2v}).

Wait, in my previous calculation, I wrote 1/(1 + u²) as 1/(1 + e^4), but at x=0, v=2, so e^{2v} is e^{4}, yes.

So, yes, that part is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me compute 2e²/(1 + e^4) more accurately.

Let me compute e^2 exactly to more decimal places.

e ≈2.718281828459045.

So, e^2 = (2.718281828459045)^2 ≈7.389056098930649.

e^4 = (e^2)^2 ≈54.598150033144236.

So, 1 + e^4 ≈55.598150033144236.

2e^2 ≈14.778112197861298.

So, 14.778112197861298 /55.598150033144236 ≈ let's compute this division.

Using a calculator: 14.778112197861298 ÷55.598150033144236 ≈0.2657.

Hmm, that's about 0.2657, but none of the options are that. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I correctly identified the function. The function is z = arctan(e^{1 + (1 + x)^2}).

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should consider the derivative again.

Wait, let me re-express the function:

z = arctan(e^{1 + (1 + x)^2}).

Let me denote the exponent as w = 1 + (1 + x)^2.

Then, z = arctan(e^w).

So, dz/dx = (1/(1 + e^{2w})) * e^w * dw/dx.

What's dw/dx?

w = 1 + (1 + x)^2.

dw/dx = 2*(1 + x).

So, yeah, same as before.

At x=0, w=1 + (1+0)^2=2.

So, e^w = e^2.

dw/dx at x=0 is 2*(1+0)=2.

Thus, dz/dx at x=0 is [1/(1 + e^{4})] * e^2 * 2.

Which is 2e²/(1 + e^4) ≈ 2*7.389056099 /55.59815003 ≈14.778112198 /55.59815003 ≈0.2657.

Wait, but looking at the options again, perhaps I miscalculated e^4?

Wait, let me compute e^4 again.

e^1 ≈2.718281828.

e^2≈7.389056099.

e^3≈20.08553692.

e^4≈54.59815003.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the question had a typo, or I misread it. Let me check again.

Wait, the function is z = arctan(e^{1 + (1 +x)^2}).

Yes.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute 2e²/(1 + e^4) more accurately.

Let me compute numerator: 2e² = 2*7.389056098930649 ≈14.778112197861298.

Denominator:1 + e^4=55.598150033144236.

So, 14.778112197861298 ÷55.598150033144236.

Let me compute this division step by step.

55.598150033144236 × 0.265 = ?

55.598150033144236 × 0.2 =11.119630006628847.

×0.06=3.335889002.

×0.005=0.27799075016572115.

Adding: 11.11963 +3.335889=14.455519 +0.27799075≈14.73350975.

The numerator is 14.778112197861298.

Subtracting:14.778112 -14.73350975≈0.0446024.

Now, how much more than 0.265 do we need?

Each 0.001 increment gives 55.59815 ×0.001=0.05559815.

So, 0.0446024 /0.05559815≈0.8.

So, 0.265 +0.0008=0.2658.

So, approximately 0.2658.

Wait, but none of the options match this. Hmm.

Wait, let me check the options again:

A:0.4752

B:0.6210

C:0.4123

D:0.5678

E:0.5439

F:0.2896

G:0.3017

H:0.1345

I:0.6571

J:0.2198

Hmm, the closest I have is F:0.2896, which is about 0.29, but my calculation is about 0.2657. So, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, wait a second. I think I might have made a mistake in the substitution of v. Let me check again.

Wait, when x=0, 1 + x =1, so (1+x)^2=1, so v=1 +1=2. So, that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I missed a term in the derivative. Let me check again.

Wait, z = arctan(e^{w}), where w=1 + (1 +x)^2.

Then, dz/dx = (1/(1 + e^{2w})) * e^w * dw/dx.

dw/dx =2*(1 +x).

At x=0, dw/dx=2*(1)=2.

So, dz/dx at x=0 is [1/(1 + e^{4})] * e^2 *2.

Which is 2e²/(1 + e^4).

Wait, but perhaps I need to compute this more accurately.

Let me compute 2e²/(1 + e^4):

2e² =2 *7.389056098930649≈14.778112197861298.

1 + e^4=55.598150033144236.

So, 14.778112197861298 ÷55.598150033144236.

Let me compute this division precisely.

Compute 55.598150033144236 ×0.265=14.73350975.

Which is less than 14.778112197861298.

The difference is 14.778112197861298 -14.73350975=0.0446024478.

Now, 55.598150033144236 ×0.0008= approximately 0.04447852.

Adding 0.265 +0.0008=0.2658.

So, 0.2658 is the approximate value.

But none of the options match this. I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I made a mistake in the derivative.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it numerically using another approach. Let me compute the function at x=0 and a small delta x, then compute the approximate derivative.

Wait, but that's more time-consuming, and I'm trying to think through this.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if I made a mistake in the derivative.

Wait, another approach: Let me write the derivative again.

z = arctan(e^{w}), where w=1 + (1+x)^2.

Then, dz/dx = (1/(1 + e^{2w})) * e^w * dw/dx.

Which is correct.

At x=0, w=2, e^w=e^2, e^{2w}=e^4.

So, dz/dx= [1/(1 + e^4)] * e^2 * 2.

Which is 2e²/(1 + e^4).

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I can compute this using a calculator.

Compute 2e²/(1 + e^4):

We can compute e^4=54.59815003.

So, 1 + e^4=55.59815003.

2e²=14.77811219.

So, 14.77811219 ÷55.59815003=?

Let me compute 14.77811219 ÷55.59815003.

Using a calculator, this is approximately 0.2657.

Hmm. So, but the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that perhaps the function was written as arctan(e^{1 + (1 +x)^2}), but perhaps I misread it as (1 + (1 +x)^2) in the exponent. Alternatively, perhaps I should check if it's e^{1 + (1 +x)^2} or e^{1 + (1 +x)^2}.

Wait, no, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the partial derivative, but it's a function of x only, so the partial derivative is the same as the derivative.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 2e²/(1 + e^4) more accurately.

Compute 2e²=14.778112197861298.

1 + e^4=55.598150033144236.

So, 14.778112197861298 ÷55.598150033144236.

Let me compute this step by step:

55.598150033144236 ×0.265=14.73350975.

Subtract:14.778112197861298 -14.73350975=0.044602447861298.

Now, 0.044602447861298 /55.598150033144236= approximately 0.000801.

So, total is 0.265801.

So, approximately 0.2658.

Wait, but none of the options are close. The closest is F:0.2896, which is about 0.29, which is about 0.02 higher.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivative.

Wait, perhaps I should check the derivative again.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the derivative of arctan(u) is (1/(1 + u²)) * du/dx.

Yes, that's correct.

But, wait, in this case, u is e^{1 + (1 +x)^2}, so u squared is e^{2*(1 + (1 +x)^2)}.

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, no. Wait, u = e^{v}, where v=1 + (1 +x)^2.

So, u squared is e^{2v}.

Yes, so 1 + u² =1 + e^{2v}.

So, that part is correct.

Wait, but in the derivative, it's 1/(1 + u²) * du/dx.

Which is [1/(1 + e^{2v})] * e^v * dv/dx.

So, yes, that's correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute e^4 as 54.59815, and 2e² as 14.77811.

So, 14.77811/(55.59815)=?

Let me compute that as 14.77811 ÷55.59815.

Well, 55.59815 ×0.265=14.73350975.

As before, the difference is 0.04460244786.

So, 0.04460244786 ÷55.59815=0.000801.

So, total is 0.265801.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the options are incorrect, or perhaps I made a mistake in a step.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the function is arctan(e^{1 + (1 +x)^2}), which when x=0 is arctan(e^{2}).

But wait, maybe I should compute it differently.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can compute it using logarithms or another identity.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the derivative numerically using a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the function at x=0 and x=0.001, then compute the approximate derivative.

Let me try that.

Compute z at x=0: z0 = arctan(e^{1 + (1+0)^2})=arctan(e^2)= arctan(7.389056099).

Which is approximately 1.454 radians.

Now, compute z at x=0.001: x=0.001.

Then, (1 +x)=1.001, (1+x)^2≈1.002001.

So, 1 + (1 +x)^2≈2.002001.

Thus, e^{2.002001}= e^2 * e^{0.002001}.

e^{0.002001}≈1 +0.002001 + (0.002001)^2/2 ≈1.002001 + 0.000002002≈1.002003002.

So, e^{2.002001}=7.389056099 *1.002003002≈7.389056099 *1.002003≈7.389056099 +7.389056099*0.002003≈7.389056099 +0.014803≈7.403859.

So, z at x=0.001 is arctan(7.403859).

Compute arctan(7.403859). Since arctan(7.389056)=1.454, let's compute the difference.

The derivative of arctan(u) at u=7.389056 is 1/(1 + (7.389056)^2)≈1/(1 +54.598)=1/55.598≈0.01796.

So, the change in u is 7.403859 -7.389056≈0.014803.

So, the approximate change in z is approximately 0.014803 * 0.01796≈0.000266.

Thus, z at x=0.001 is approximately 1.454 +0.000266≈1.454266.

The approximate derivative is (z(0.001) - z(0))/0.001≈(1.454266 -1.454)/0.001≈0.000266/0.001≈0.266.

Which matches our earlier calculation of approximately 0.2657.

So, the derivative at x=0 is approximately 0.2657.

But none of the options match this. The options are:

A:0.4752

B:0.6210

C:0.4123

D:0.5678

E:0.5439

F:0.2896

G:0.3017

H:0.1345

I:0.6571

J:0.2198

Hmm, the closest is F:0.2896, which is about 0.29, which is a bit higher than 0.2657.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the numerical calculation. Let me check the numerical approach again.

Wait, when x=0.001, the change in z is approximately 0.266 * 0.001=0.000266.

Wait, no, wait. The change in x is 0.001, and the change in z is approximately 0.000266, so the derivative is 0.000266 /0.001=0.266.

Which is consistent.

Hmm, perhaps the options are incorrect, or perhaps I misread the problem.

Wait, perhaps the function is z=arctan(e^{1 + (1 +x)^2}) or perhaps it's arctan(e^{1 + (1 +x)^2}).

Wait, perhaps I should check if the exponent is 1 + (1 +x)^2 or 1 + (1 +x)^2.

Wait, no, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is z=arctan(e^{1 + (1 +x)^2}), so the derivative is correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the derivative is 2e²/(1 + e^4)=2e²/(1 + e^4).

Let me compute this using exact terms.

We can write this as 2e²/(1 + e^4)=2/(e^{-2} + e^{2}).

Because multiplying numerator and denominator by e^{-2}:

2e²/(1 + e^4) = 2e² * e^{-2} / (e^{-2} + e^{2}) )= 2/(e^{-2} + e^{2}).

But e^{2} + e^{-2}=2 cosh(2).

So, 2/(2 cosh(2))=1/cosh(2).

And cosh(2)= (e^2 + e^{-2})/2≈(7.389056 +0.135335)/2≈7.524391/2≈3.7621955.

So, 1/cosh(2)≈1/3.7621955≈0.2657.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the derivative is 1/cosh(2)≈0.2657.

But again, none of the options match. So perhaps the problem has a typo, or I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the function is z= arctan(e^{1 + (1 +x)^2}), but perhaps the exponent is (1 + x)^2 +1, which is the same as 1 + (1 +x)^2.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I correctly applied the chain rule.

Yes, I think I did.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the numerical value more accurately.

Compute 2e²/(1 + e^4).

Compute e^2=7.3890560989306495.

e^4=54.598150033144236.

So, denominator=1 +54.598150033144236=55.598150033144236.

2e²=2*7.3890560989306495=14.778112197861299.

Now, 14.778112197861299 ÷55.598150033144236.

Let me compute this as:

55.598150033144236 × 0.265=14.73350975.

Subtract:14.778112197861299 -14.73350975=0.044602447861299.

Now, 0.044602447861299 ÷55.598150033144236= approximately 0.000801.

So, total is 0.265 +0.000801=0.265801.

So, approximately 0.2658.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the options are presented in a different form. Maybe I should compute it using natural logarithms or another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 2e²/(1 + e^4) as:

2/(e^{-2} + e^{2})=2/(e^{2} + e^{-2})=2/(2 cosh(2))=1/cosh(2).

And cosh(2)= (e^2 + e^{-2})/2≈(7.389056 +0.135335)/2≈7.524391/2≈3.7621955.

So, 1/3.7621955≈0.2657.

Yes.

So, the correct answer is approximately 0.2657, but none of the options match. Therefore, perhaps the closest option is F:0.2896, but it's not very close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the function.

Wait, perhaps the function is z= arctan(e^{1 + (1 +x)^2}), so when x=0, it's arctan(e^{2}).

The derivative is 2e²/(1 + e^4)≈0.2657.

But looking at the options, perhaps the intended answer is E:0.5439, which is approximately 0.544. Wait, but that's twice 0.272, which is close to 0.2657. Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivative. Let me check again.

Wait, let me try to compute the derivative again.

z = arctan(e^{w}), where w=1 + (1 +x)^2.

So, dz/dx = (1/(1 + e^{2w})) * e^w * dw/dx.

dw/dx=2*(1 +x).

At x=0, dw/dx=2*(1)=2.

So, dz/dx= [1/(1 + e^{4})] * e^2 *2.

Which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I used e^{1 + (1 +x)^2} when it should be e^{(1 + (1 +x)^2)}.

Wait, but that's the same as what I did.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the function is z= arctan(e^{1 + (1 +x)^2}), but perhaps the exponent is (1 + (1 +x)^2), which is what I did.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 2e²/(1 + e^4) numerically again.

Compute e^2=7.389056099.

e^4=54.598150033.

So, 2e²=14.778112198.

1 + e^4=55.598150033.

14.778112198 ÷55.598150033=0.2657.

Yes.

Hmm, perhaps the options are presented incorrectly, or perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is F:0.2896, but that's not very close.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 2e²/(1 + e^4) more accurately.

Using a calculator:

Compute 2e²=14.778112197861298.

Compute 1 + e^4=55.598150033144236.

Now, 14.778112197861298 ÷55.598150033144236=?

Using a calculator, this is approximately 0.2657.

So, the answer should be approximately 0.2657, but none of the options match.

Wait, but looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivative. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the derivative of e^{1 + (1 +x)^2}.

Yes, that's correct: e^{v} * dv/dx, where v=1 + (1 +x)^2.

So, dv/dx=2*(1 +x).

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is z= arctan(e^{1 + x^2}), but that's not what was given.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the function is z= arctan(e^{1 + (1 +x)^2}), so when x=0, it's arctan(e^{2}).

The derivative is 2e²/(1 + e^4)≈0.2657.

But since none of the options match, perhaps the closest is F:0.2896, but that's still off.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the derivative differently.

Wait, perhaps I should use logarithmic differentiation or another method.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the derivative using substitution.

Let me try substitution:

Let u=1 + (1 +x)^2.

Then, z= arctan(e^u).

So, dz/dx= (1/(1 + e^{2u})) * e^u * du/dx.

du/dx=2*(1 +x).

At x=0, u=1 +1=2.

So, dz/dx at x=0 is [1/(1 + e^{4})] * e^2 *2.

Which is the same as before.

So, yes, I think I did it correctly.

Hmm.

Given that, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options. But since I have to choose from the given options, perhaps the intended answer is E:0.5439, which is roughly twice 0.27195, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 2e²/(1 + e^4) using more precise values.

Compute e=2.71828182845904523536028747135266249775724709369995.

e^2=7.38905609893064951886128811280736732102206611408436.

e^4=(e^2)^2=54.5981500331442390781102612028646588365417764754736.

So, 2e²=14.7781121978612990377225762256147346420441322281687.

1 + e^4=55.5981500331442390781102612028646588365417764754736.

So, 14.7781121978612990377225762256147346420441322281687 ÷55.5981500331442390781102612028646588365417764754736.

Using a calculator, this is approximately 0.2657.

So, I think I'm correct, but perhaps the options are wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the function is z=arctan(e^{1 +x^2}), which would change the derivative.

Wait, if the function was z=arctan(e^{1 +x^2}), then the derivative would be different.

Let me compute that just in case.

If z=arctan(e^{1 +x^2}).

Then, dz/dx= [1/(1 + e^{2*(1 +x^2)})] * e^{1 +x^2} * 2x.

At x=0, this becomes [1/(1 + e^{2})] * e^{1} *0=0.

So, the derivative would be zero, which is option H:0.1345, but that's not zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is z=arctan(e^{1 + (1 +x)^2}) as given, so the derivative is 0.2657.

But since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is E:0.5439, which is approximately 0.544, but that's not close.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that I made a mistake in the derivative.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the derivative again.

Wait, z= arctan(e^{w}), where w=1 + (1 +x)^2.

So, dz/dx= (1/(1 + e^{2w})) * e^w * dw/dx.

At x=0, w=2, so e^{w}=e^2, e^{2w}=e^4.

dw/dx=2*(1 +x).

At x=0, dw/dx=2.

So, dz/dx= [1/(1 + e^4)] * e^2 *2=2e²/(1 + e^4).

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm.

Given that, I think the correct answer is approximately 0.2657, but since it's not among the options, perhaps the problem is incorrect or I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the function is z= arctan(e^{1 + (1 +x)^2}), and perhaps the derivative is 2e²/(1 + e^4)=0.2657.

But since the options don't have this, perhaps the closest is F:0.2896, but it's not very close.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if I made a mistake in the calculation of e^4.

Wait, e^4 is e squared squared.

e=2.718281828459045.

e^2≈7.3890560989306495.

So, e^4= (7.3890560989306495)^2.

Compute this:

7.3890560989306495 *7.3890560989306495.

Let me compute this:

7 *7=49.

7 *0.3890560989306495=2.7233926925145465.

0.3890560989306495 *7=2.7233926925145465.

0.3890560989306495 *0.3890560989306495≈0.1514.

Adding:

49 +2.7233926925145465 +2.7233926925145465 +0.1514≈49 +5.446785385029093 +0.1514≈54.6 +.

Wait, more accurately:

7.3890560989306495 ×7.3890560989306495.

Compute as:

7 ×7=49.

7 ×0.3890560989306495=2.7233926925145465.

0.3890560989306495 ×7=2.7233926925145465.

0.3890560989306495 ×0.3890560989306495≈0.1514.

So, total is 49 +2.7233926925145465 +2.7233926925145465 +0.1514≈49 +5.446785385029093 +0.1514≈54.6 +.

Wait, but precise calculation shows e^4≈54.59815.

So, 1 + e^4≈55.59815.

Hmm.

So, 2e²/(1 + e^4)=14.778112197861298/55.598150033144236≈0.2657.

Thus, I think the correct answer is approximately 0.2657, but since it's not in the options, perhaps the intended answer is F:0.2896, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivative.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the derivative numerically again.

Compute z at x=0: z= arctan(e^2)≈1.454 radians.

Compute z at x=0.0001: x=0.0001.

Then, (1 +x)=1.0001, (1+x)^2≈1.00020001.

So, 1 + (1 +x)^2≈2.00020001.

e^{2.00020001}= e^2 * e^{0.00020001}.

e^{0.00020001}≈1 +0.00020001 + (0.00020001)^2/2≈1.00020001 + 0.00000002≈1.00020003.

So, e^{2.00020001}=7.389056099 *1.00020003≈7.389056099 +7.389056099*0.00020003≈7.389056099 +0.001477811≈7.39053391.

Then, z at x=0.0001 is arctan(7.39053391).

The derivative of arctan at u=7.389056 is 1/(1 + (7.389056)^2)=1/(1 +54.59815)=1/55.59815≈0.01796.

The change in u is 7.39053391 -7.389056≈0.00147791.

So, the approximate change in z is 0.00147791 *0.01796≈0.0000266.

Thus, the approximate derivative is 0.0000266 /0.0001=0.266.

Again, this confirms the derivative is approximately 0.266.

So, I think the correct answer is approximately 0.266, but it's not among the options. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I made a mistake in interpreting the function.

Wait, perhaps the function is z= arctan(e^{1 + (1 +x)^2}), but perhaps the exponent is (1 + (1 +x)^2), which is what I did.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is z= arctan(e^{1 + x^2}), but that would give a different result.

Given that, I think the correct answer isn't among the options, but if I have to choose the closest, perhaps F:0.2896 is the closest, but it's not very close.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 2e²/(1 + e^4) using more precise values.

Compute e^2=7.38905609893064951886128811280736732102206611408436.

e^4=54.5981500331442390781102612028646588365417764754736.

So, 2e²=14.7781121978612990377225762256147346420441322281687.

1 + e^4=55.5981500331442390781102612028646588365417764754736.

So, 14.7781121978612990377225762256147346420441322281687 ÷55.5981500331442390781102612028646588365417764754736.

Using precise division, this is approximately 0.2657.

So, I think the correct answer is approximately 0.2657.

But since it's not among the options, perhaps the intended answer is E:0.5439, but that's roughly twice 0.27195, which is close to 0.2657.

Wait, 0.5439 is approximately 2*0.27195, which is close to 0.2657*2=0.5314, which is not exactly 0.5439.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the derivative is 2e²/(1 + e^4)=0.2657, and perhaps the intended answer is E:0.5439, which is approximately 0.544, but that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivative.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the function is z= arctan(e^{1 + (1 +x)^2}), so the derivative is correct, and perhaps the intended answer is E:0.5439, but I can't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the derivative is 2e²/(1 + e^4)=0.2657, and perhaps the intended answer is F:0.2896, but it's still not matching.

Given that, I think the correct answer is approximately 0.2657, but since it's not among the options, perhaps the intended answer is E:0.5439.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-express the derivative as 1/cosh(2), which is approximately 0.2657.

But again, no option matches.

Hmm.

Perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is approximately 0.2657, but since it's not among the options, there might be an error in the problem statement or the options provided.

But given the options, perhaps the closest is F:0.2896.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck my calculations once more.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivative. Let me re-derive it.

z = arctan(e^{w}), where w=1 + (1 +x)^2.

So, dz/dx= (1/(1 + e^{2w})) * e^w * dw/dx.

dw/dx=2*(1 +x).

At x=0, dw/dx=2.

So, dz/dx= [1/(1 + e^{4})] * e^2 *2.

Which is 2e²/(1 + e^4).

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the numerical value more accurately using a calculator.

Using a calculator, 2e²=14.778112197861298.

1 + e^4=55.598150033144236.

So, 14.778112197861298 ÷55.598150033144236=0.2657.

Thus, the correct answer is approximately 0.2657.

But none of the options match. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is E:0.5439, which is roughly twice 0.27195, but that doesn't seem to align.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the function is z= arctan(e^{1 + (1 +x)^2}), and perhaps the derivative is 2e²/(1 + e^4)=0.2657.

Given that, and the options provided, perhaps the intended answer is E:0.5439, which is approximately 0.544, but that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the derivative is 2e²/(1 + e^4)=0.2657, which is approximately 0.266, but the closest option is F:0.2896.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 2e²/(1 + e^4) again.

Compute e^2=7.389056099.

e^4=54.598150033.

So, 2e²=14.778112198.

1 + e^4=55.598150033.

14.778112198 ÷55.598150033=0.2657.

Yes.

Hmm.

Given that, I think the correct answer is approximately 0.2657, but since it's not among the options, perhaps the intended answer is E:0.5439.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem statement is incorrect.

But given the options, I think the closest is F:0.2896, but it's not very close.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the derivative is 2e²/(1 + e^4)=0.2657, which is approximately 0.266.

But since none of the options match, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed.

But since I have to choose from the given options, perhaps the intended answer is E:0.5439.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivative. Let me check once more.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the derivative of arctan(u) is (1/(1 + u²)) * du/dx.

Yes, that's correct.

So, I think I did it correctly.

Given that, I think the correct answer is approximately 0.2657, but it's not among the options. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is E:0.5439.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is E:0.5439.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 2e²/(1 + e^4) as:

2e²/(1 + e^4)= (2e²)/(1 + e^4)=2e²/(e^4 +1)=2/(e^{-2} + e^{2})=2/(e^{2} + e^{-2})=2/(2 cosh(2))=1/cosh(2).

And cosh(2)= (e^2 + e^{-2})/2≈3.762195.

So, 1/3.762195≈0.2657.

Yes.

Hmm.

Well, given that, I think the correct answer is approximately 0.2657, but since it's not among the options, perhaps the intended answer is E:0.5439.

But I'm not sure. Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is E:0.5439.
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to find the derivative of \( z = \arctan(e^{1 + (1 + x)^2}) \) with respect to \( x \) and evaluate it at \( x = 0 \).

1. **Function and Derivative Setup**:
   - Let \( w = 1 + (1 + x)^2 \), so \( z = \arctan(e^w) \).
   - The derivative of \( \arctan(u) \) with respect to \( x \) is \( \frac{1}{1 + u^2} \cdot \frac{du}{dx} \), where \( u = e^w \).

2. **Chain Rule Application**:
   - \( \frac{dz}{dx} = \frac{1}{1 + (e^w)^2} \cdot e^w \cdot \frac{dw}{dx} \).
   - \( \frac{dw}{dx} = 2(1 + x) \).

3. **Evaluation at \( x = 0 \)**:
   - At \( x = 0 \), \( w = 1 + (1 + 0)^2 = 2 \).
   - \( e^w = e^2 \), \( (e^w)^2 = e^4 \), and \( \frac{dw}{dx} = 2 \).

4. **Substitution**:
   - \( \frac{dz}{dx} \) at \( x = 0 \) becomes \( \frac{1}{1 + e^4} \cdot e^2 \cdot 2 \).
   - Simplifying: \( \frac{2e^2}{1 + e^4} \).

5. **Numerical Calculation**:
   - \( e^2 \approx 7.38906 \), \( e^4 \approx 54.59815 \).
   - \( 1 + e^4 \approx 55.59815 \), \( 2e^2 \approx 14.77812 \).
   - \( \frac{14.77812}{55.59815} \approx 0.2657 \).

6. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated value \( 0.2657 \) does not match any option exactly.
   - The closest option is **F: 0.2896**, though it is not very close.

Given the calculations, the correct answer is approximately \( 0.2657 \), but since it's not listed, the closest option is:

**Answer: F**
