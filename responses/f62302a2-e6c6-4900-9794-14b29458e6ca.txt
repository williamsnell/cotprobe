Okay, so I need to calculate the future value of an ordinary annuity. Hmm, what's an ordinary annuity again? I think it's when the payments are made at the end of each period. So, in this case, the person is making $800 payments each year for 4 years, and the interest rate is 5%. 

I remember there's a formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity. Let me try to recall it. I think it's FV = PMT * [(1 + r)^n - 1] / r. Right, where PMT is the payment, r is the interest rate, and n is the number of periods.

So plugging in the numbers: PMT is $800, r is 5% which is 0.05, and n is 4 years. Let me write that out.

FV = 800 * [(1 + 0.05)^4 - 1] / 0.05

First, I'll calculate (1 + 0.05)^4. 1.05 to the power of 4. Let me compute that step by step. 

1.05 squared is 1.1025. Then, squaring that again for the fourth power: 1.1025 * 1.1025. Let me do that multiplication. 

1.1025 * 1.1025: 

1.1 * 1.1 is 1.21, and the rest might add up. Wait, actually, let's compute it properly. 

1.1025 * 1.1025:
Multiply 11025 by 11025, then divide by 10000^2 (which is 100000000). But that's a bit tedious. Alternatively, I can use the formula (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b², where a=1.1 and b=0.0025.

Wait, maybe it's easier to just calculate it numerically.

1.1025 * 1.1025:

First, 1 * 1.1025 = 1.1025.
Then, 0.1025 * 1.1025. Let's compute 0.1 * 1.1025 = 0.11025, and 0.0025 * 1.1025 = 0.00275625. Adding those together: 0.11025 + 0.00275625 = 0.11300625. So total is 1.1025 + 0.11300625 = 1.21550625.

Wait, that doesn't seem right because 1.1025 squared should be approximately 1.21550625. Yes, that's correct.

So (1.05)^4 = 1.21550625.

Next, subtract 1: 1.21550625 - 1 = 0.21550625.

Then divide by 0.05: 0.21550625 / 0.05 = 4.310125.

Now multiply by PMT, which is 800: 800 * 4.310125.

Let me calculate that. 800 * 4 = 3200, and 800 * 0.310125 = 248.1, because 800 * 0.3 is 240, and 800 * 0.010125 is 8.1. So adding 240 + 8.1 = 248.1. So total is 3200 + 248.1 = 3448.1.

Looking at the options, option F is 3448.1. So that should be the correct answer.

The future value is calculated using the annuity formula, resulting in $3,448.10, which corresponds to option F.
