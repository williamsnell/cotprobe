Okay, so I have this question about required reserves, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about required reserves. 

Required reserves are funds that banks are legally obligated to hold, set by the central bank, usually the FED in the US. These reserves are important for maintaining the stability of the banking system because they ensure that banks have enough cash on hand to meet their obligations, like fulfilling deposit withdrawals.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A says they can be used by banks to make loans or buy investments. Wait, required reserves are meant to be held, not used. So if a bank uses them for loans or investments, they wouldn't have enough reserves. That might not be right.

Option B says they must be held exclusively at the FED. I'm not sure about that. I think banks can hold some reserves in their own vaults and some at the FED. So B might not be correct.

Option C says they must be kept in a bank's vault. But I remember that banks can keep part of their reserves at the FED as well, so C is probably incorrect.

Option D says they're optional for large banks but mandatory for smaller ones. No, required reserves are a requirement for all banks, regardless of size. So D is wrong.

Option E says they can be invested in government securities. Wait, no, required reserves are liquid assets that banks can't invest in things like securities. They have to keep them as cash or in accounts at the FED.

Option F says they must be used to pay off bank debts. That doesn't sound right. Required reserves are for liquidity, not for paying off debts.

Option G says they can be used to cover operational expenses. Again, I think reserves are held, not used for expenses. So G is likely incorrect.

Option H says they can be held in a bank's vault or its account at the FED. That sounds familiar. I think banks can keep some reserves in their vault and some in their FED account. So H might be correct.

Option I says they must be used to make loans. No, required reserves are kept as idle funds, not used for loans.

Option J says they're not required. That's definitely wrong because the whole point of required reserves is that they are mandatory.

So, narrowing it down, the correct answer is either H. It allows for the reserves to be held either in the vault or at the FED, which matches what I know about how banks manage their required reserves.
