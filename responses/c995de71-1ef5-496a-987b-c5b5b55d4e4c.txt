Question:

Mr. Patrick is preparing a five-question true-false quiz for his class. He flips a coin before writing the first question. If it is heads, he writes a true statement and if it is tails, he writes a false statement. He continues this until all five statements are written. What is the probability that the correct sequence of answers is TFTFT ? Express your answer as a common fraction.

Options:

A: \frac{1}{256}
B: \frac{1}{32}
C: \frac{1}{16}
D: \frac{1}{1024}
E: \frac{1}{8}
F: \frac{1}{4}
G: \frac{1}{6}
H: \frac{1}{2}
I: \frac{1}{128}
J: \frac{1}{64}

Okay, so I've got this problem here where Mr. Patrick is creating a five-question true-false quiz. He's flipping a coin for each question. If it's heads, he writes a true statement, and if it's tails, he writes a false one. The question is asking for the probability that the correct sequence of answers is TFTFT. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Mr. Patrick is making each question by flipping a coin. So each question is independent, right? Each flip has two possible outcomes, heads or tails, so each question is either true or false based on that flip.

Now, the quiz has five questions, so he flips the coin five times. Each flip is independent, meaning the result of one doesn't affect the others. So each question is like a separate event.

The specific question is about the probability that the correct sequence of answers is TFTFT. Wait, but wait—does that mean the sequence of statements he writes is TFTFT, or the sequence of answers that his students would give? Hmm, actually, the problem says he's writing the statements, and the correct sequence of answers would be the answers that match those statements. So if the statements are TFTFT, then the correct answers would be T, F, T, F, T, right?

Wait, no, no—I think I'm getting confused. Let me read the question again. It says, "What is the probability that the correct sequence of answers is TFTFT?" So the correct answers are the ones that match the statements, which are determined by the coin flips. So, for each flip, if it's heads, the statement is true, so the correct answer is T; if tails, the statement is false, so the correct answer is F.

So the correct answer sequence is the same as the sequence of coin flips. Because each flip determines the statement's truth, and thus the correct answer.

Wait, that's right. So each question's correct answer is determined by the coin flip: heads → T, tails → F. So the sequence of correct answers is the same as the sequence of coin flips.

So the problem is asking for the probability that the sequence of correct answers is TFTFT. Which is the same as the probability that the sequence of coin flips is TFTFT.

Since each flip is independent and has a 1/2 chance of being heads or tails, the probability of any specific sequence of five flips is (1/2)^5.

Calculating that, (1/2)^5 is 1/32. Because 2^5 is 32. So the probability is 1/32.

Let me double-check that. Each flip is independent, so for five flips, the total number of possible sequences is 2^5 = 32. Each sequence has an equal probability, so each has a 1/32 chance. Since TFTFT is one specific sequence, the probability is indeed 1/32.

Looking at the options, option B is 1/32. So that's the answer.
</think>

The probability of each specific sequence of five coin flips is (1/2)^5 = 1/32. Since TFTFT is one such sequence, the probability is 1/32.

Answer: B
