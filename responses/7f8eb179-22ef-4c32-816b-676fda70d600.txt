Question:

Co-defendants were dealers at a casino. They had been employed by the casino for four years. One day, they were unexpectedly fired by the casino's new manager. Apparently, the casino hired the new manager to get rid of some of the old-time employees and replace them with new personnel at a lower wage. Angered by their firing, the codefendants vowed to get back at the casino. As their revenge, they decided to plant a bomb in the casino and demand $1,000,000. After receiving the money, they would then reveal the location of the bomb and provide details for defusing it. The co-defendants agreed that the casino should be given adequate warning so that nobody would be injured. In accordance with their plan, one of the co-defendants, who was an electronics expert, built the bomb himself. He alone then drove to the casino where he placed the bomb in a hallway closet. Shortly thereafter, the other co-defendant phoned the casino and made a demand for the money. He said a bomb was in the casino and that it would explode in 24 hours unless the money was paid. The casino treated their demand as a crank call and refused to make any payment. With their plans having gone awry, the codefendants agreed that one of them should return to the casino and defuse the bomb. As one of the co-defendants was driving back to the casino, the bomb exploded, killing 30 people. A subsequent investigation revealed that a faulty wire caused the bomb to detonate prematurely. A state statute provides that detonating or attempting to detonate a bomb or explosive device in or near a building or dwelling is a felony. If the co-defendants are charged with violating the aforementioned statute, which of the following statements is correct?

Options:

A: Both are guilty, because each participated in the planning of the crime.
B: Only the co-defendant who built the bomb is guilty, because he physically placed the bomb in the casino.
C: Neither is guilty, because they did not intend for anyone to be killed, but the bomb exploded prematurely.
D: The co-defendant who built the bomb is guilty, because he built and transported the bomb, but the other co-defendant is not guilty, because his phone call was not a substantial step in the furtherance of the crime.
E: Both are guilty, but only the one who made the phone call is guilty of a felony.
F: Both are not guilty, because they intended to defuse the bomb before it exploded.
G: Both are guilty, but only the one who built the bomb is guilty of a felony.
H: Neither is guilty, because the faulty wire, an unforeseeable circumstance, caused the bomb to explode.
I: Neither is guilty, because the casino's gross negligence in failing to heed the telephone warning constituted an independent intervening cause of the explosion.
J: The co-defendant who made the phone call is guilty, because he made the demand for the money.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically regarding co-defendants and their responsibilities in a bombing case. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: Two co-defendants were fired from their casino jobs and decided to plant a bomb as revenge. They planned to demand $1 million and then reveal how to defuse it. One built the bomb and placed it, the other made the phone call. But when the casino didn't pay, they decided one should go back to defuse it. On the way back, the bomb exploded because of a faulty wire, killing 30 people.

The statute says detonating or attempting to detonate a bomb near a building is a felony. So the question is, are the co-defendants guilty under this statute?

I remember that in criminal law, especially under the felony murder rule, if a death occurs during the commission of a felony, the perpetrators can be charged with murder. But here, the question is specifically about their guilt under the statute regarding bomb detonation.

Let me consider each option:

Option A: Both guilty because they planned it. Well, they did plan it, but the question is about the statute which focuses on the act of detonating or attempting. Did both of them commit that act?

Option B: Only the one who built the bomb is guilty. He did place it, but the other made the call. Does making the call count as part of the crime?

Option C: Neither guilty because they didn't intend to kill. But the statute doesn't require intent to kill; it's about the act of detonating or attempting. So this seems incorrect.

Option D: Only the builder is guilty because he built and placed the bomb, the other's call wasn't a substantial step. Hmm, but making a demand could be seen as furthering the crime. I'm not sure if a phone call is a substantial step.

Option E: Both guilty, but only the caller is guilty of the felony. That doesn't make sense because the felony is placing the bomb, not the call.

Option F: Both not guilty because they intended to defuse it. But the bomb went off prematurely. Intent to defuse doesn't negate the initial act of placing the bomb, which is a felony.

Option G: Builder guilty, the other not. But under accomplice liability, maybe the caller is also guilty.

Option H: Neither guilty because of the faulty wire. This seems like an unforeseeable event. But the act of placing the bomb was the felony; the premature explosion might not absolve them of the initial crime.

Option I: Casino's negligence as an intervening cause. But the explosion was due to a faulty wire, not the casino's actions, so maybe this doesn't apply.

Option J: Only the caller guilty. But the main act was placing the bomb, so the caller might not be guilty unless his actions furthered the felony.

Wait, the statute is about detonating or attempting to detonate. The builder placed the bomb, which is part of the attempt. The caller made the demand, which is part of the scheme, but does that constitute an attempt? Or was the attempt already completed when the bomb was placed?

In criminal law, the attempt to commit a crime can be completed even if the final act isn't done yet, as long as a substantial step is taken towards its commission. Here, the bomb was placed, which is a substantial step towards detonation. So both could be guilty as accomplices.

But looking at the options, Option A says both are guilty because they planned. But under the statute, the key is the act of detonating or attempting. The builder placed the bomb, which is the attempt. The other co-defendant made the call, which is part of the scheme but not the physical act. However, in conspiracy or accomplice liability, both could be guilty if they both intended the felony.

Wait, but the question is about the specific statute. So the statute is about the act of detonating or attempting. The builder did that by placing the bomb. The other co-defendant made the call, which is part of the plan but not the act of detonation. So perhaps only the builder is guilty.

But wait, the phone call was part of the attempt because it's part of the plan to get the money and then defuse. So the call could be seen as furtherance of the attempt. But under the statute, the key is the act of detonating or attempting. So maybe the caller didn't commit that act.

Alternatively, perhaps both are guilty as principals because they both intended the felony. The builder did the act, the caller was part of the plan.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The statute is about detonating or attempting. The builder placed the bomb, which is an attempt. The caller made the demand, which is part of the overall plan but not the act of detonation. So perhaps only the builder is guilty.

Looking at the options, Option B says only the builder is guilty because he placed the bomb. But I'm not sure if the caller is also guilty as an accomplice.

Wait, the concept of conspiracy might apply. If they conspired to plant the bomb, both could be guilty. But the question is about the specific statute, which is about the act of detonating. So maybe the caller isn't guilty under that statute unless his actions constitute an attempt.

Alternatively, the caller's act of making the phone call could be seen as a step towards the felony. But I'm not sure if that's enough for the statute.

Wait, the statute doesn't require intent to kill, just the act of detonating or attempting. So the builder placed the bomb, which is an attempt. The caller made the demand, which is part of the plan but not the act of detonation. So perhaps only the builder is guilty under the statute.

But then, looking at the options, Option D says the builder is guilty, the other isn't because his call wasn't a substantial step. So that might be correct.

Wait, but in some jurisdictions, making a demand over the phone could be considered a substantial step towards the felony. So maybe both are guilty.

Alternatively, the felony was the act of placing the bomb. So the caller didn't commit that act, but he's an accomplice.

I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think about the elements. The statute requires detonating or attempting to detonate. The builder did the attempt by placing the bomb. The caller didn't attempt to detonate; he just made a call.

So under the statute, only the builder is guilty. Therefore, Option B might be correct. But wait, the other co-defendant also participated in the plan. So perhaps they're both guilty as principals.

Alternatively, under the doctrine of continuing-felony rule, the felony continues until the bomb is defused. So the call and the subsequent explosion might fall under the same felony. But the explosion was due to a faulty wire, so maybe they intended to defuse it but couldn't.

Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe both are guilty because they both were part of the plan to plant the bomb, which is the felony. So Option A says both are guilty because they planned. That might be the case.

Wait, but the statute is about the act of detonating or attempting. So even if they planned, only the one who did the act is guilty. Unless they both are principals.

I think the key here is that both are guilty because they both were involved in the felony. The builder placed the bomb, the caller made the demand, which is part of the felony. So both are guilty under the statute.

Wait, but the statute specifically talks about detonating or attempting. So the caller didn't do that. He just made a call. So maybe only the builder is guilty.

Alternatively, the act of making the call could be seen as furtherance of the attempt. So perhaps both are guilty.

I'm getting stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: Both guilty because of planning. Maybe.

Option B: Only builder guilty because he placed the bomb.

Option D: Builder guilty, other not because call wasn't a step.

Option E: Both guilty, but only caller guilty of felony. Doesn't make sense.

Option G: Builder guilty, other not. So same as D.

Wait, the statute is a felony for detonating or attempting. So the builder did the attempt by placing the bomb. The other co-defendant made a phone call, which is part of the scheme but not the act of detonation.

So under the statute, only the builder is guilty. Therefore, Option B would be correct. But wait, the other co-defendant also intended the felony to happen, so perhaps he's guilty as an accomplice.

Wait, the statute doesn't mention intent, just the act. So if the act is placing the bomb, only the builder did that. The caller didn't, so he's not guilty under the statute.

But wait, in criminal law, if two people conspire to commit a felony, they can both be guilty as principals. So perhaps both are guilty because they both intended the felony and took steps to further it.

So maybe Option A is correct.

I'm a bit torn here. On one hand, the statute is about the act of detonating or attempting. Only the builder placed the bomb, so he's guilty. On the other hand, both were part of the plan, so they might both be guilty under conspiracy or as principals.

I think the correct answer is that both are guilty because they both participated in the plan and the felony. So Option A would be correct.

Wait, but the statute is a specific statute about detonating or attempting. So the other co-defendant didn't do that. He made a phone call, which is part of the overall scheme but not the act of detonation.

So perhaps only the builder is guilty under the statute. So Option B would be correct.

But I'm not entirely sure. I think the answer is A, but I'm not 100% confident. Alternatively, maybe D is correct because the other's call wasn't a substantial step.

Wait, the other co-defendant made the phone call, which was part of the plan to get the money and then defuse the bomb. So that's a step towards the felony. So perhaps both are guilty.

In that case, Option A would be correct.

But I'm still unsure. Let me consider the Model Penal Code approach. Under MPC, an accomplice is guilty if they intended to promote or facilitate the felony. Here, both intended to promote the plan, so both could be guilty.

So under that, both are guilty, making Option A correct.

Therefore, the answer is A.
</think>

The co-defendants are guilty because both participated in the planning and execution of the felony, which involved detonating or attempting to detonate a bomb. The builder placed the bomb, committing the act of attempting to detonate it, while the other co-defendant made the phone call as part of the plan to further the felony. Under the statute, both are considered principals in the felony, as they both intended to promote the crime and took steps to facilitate it. Therefore, both are guilty under the statute.

Answer: A
