Okay, so I've got this question here about figuring out the normal daily allowance of sugar based on a soft drink's sugar content. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

Alright, the question says that a 12-ounce soft drink has 41 grams of sugar, and that's 14% of the daily allowance. So, I need to find out what the total daily allowance is. 

Hmm, percentages can sometimes be tricky, but I think I remember that if a certain amount represents a percentage, you can find the whole by dividing by that percentage. So, in this case, 41 grams is 14% of the total. 

Wait, let me make sure I'm thinking correctly. If 14% equals 41 grams, then the total allowance (let's call it T) times 14% should equal 41. So, mathematically, it's 0.14 * T = 41. To find T, I need to divide both sides by 0.14. 

Let me write that down: T = 41 / 0.14. Hmm, what's 41 divided by 0.14? I might need to do this calculation carefully. 

I know that 0.14 is the same as 14/100, so dividing by 0.14 is the same as multiplying by 100/14. So, 41 * (100/14) = (41*100)/14. 

Calculating 41*100 is easy, that's 4100. Now, divide 4100 by 14. Let me do that division. 

14 goes into 4100 how many times? Let's see: 14*293 is 4102, which is just a bit more than 4100. Wait, that's interesting because one of the options is J:293. But wait, I'm calculating T, the total allowance, so if 14% is 41 grams, then T should be 41 divided by 0.14, which is approximately 293 grams. 

Wait a second, but looking at the options, J is 293. So that seems to fit. But wait, let me double-check my math because sometimes I might make a mistake in division. 

Alternatively, I can think of it as 14% is 41. So, 1% would be 41 divided by 14, which is approximately 2.9286 grams. Then, the total 100% would be 2.9286 * 100, which is about 292.86 grams. Rounded, that's approximately 293 grams. 

So, yeah, that makes sense. The daily allowance is about 293 grams. Looking at the options, J is 293. So, the answer should be J. 

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. The soft drink is 14%, which is 41 grams. So, 14% of T equals 41. So T is 41 / 0.14. Yep, that's correct. 41 divided by 0.14 is indeed about 293. 

I think that's solid. So, the answer must be J:293.

The question involves calculating the normal daily allowance of sugar given that 41 grams constitutes 14% of it. Using the equation 0.14 * T = 41, we solve for T by dividing 41 by 0.14, resulting in approximately 293 grams. This corresponds to option J.

Answer: J
