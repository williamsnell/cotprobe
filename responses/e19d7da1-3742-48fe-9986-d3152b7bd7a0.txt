Okay, so I've got this economics question here about closing an expansionary gap. Hmm, I remember expansionary gaps are when the actual GDP is above the potential GDP. That usually leads to inflation because the economy is overheating. So the goal is to bring the economy back down to potential GDP without causing a recession.

The question is asking what to do to close this gap. The options are about shifting the aggregate demand (AD) and aggregate supply (AS) curves. Let me think. In the short run, if the economy is above potential, we need to reduce AD. Because AD is about demand, so if we lower it, the economy will cool down. So shifting AD to the left makes sense.

Wait, but what about AS? AS shifts with changes in productivity, like technology, resources, etc. To close an expansionary gap, do we need to shift AS? I think not immediately; the primary action is to reduce demand. Shifting AS would require changes in production capacity, which might not be as quick. So maybe we only shift AD to the left.

Looking at the options, G says AD should be shifted left. That seems right. Let me check the other options. A says AD shouldn't be shiftedâ€”no, because we need to reduce it. B says shift AD right, which would make things worse. C shifts AS left, which would reduce supply, possibly leading to more inflation or a bigger gap. D says no shifts, which doesn't solve the problem. E shifts AS right and AD left. Shifting AS right would increase supply, which could help lower prices, but is that necessary? Maybe, but the main tool is AD. F shifts AS right, which doesn't address the demand issue. H shifts both left, which could cause a recession. I says AS shouldn't shift, which is correct because we don't need to change supply immediately. J shifts both right, which is bad.

So the best answer is G: shift AD to the left.

The correct answer is to shift the aggregate demand curve to the left to close an expansionary gap. This reduces demand and brings the economy back to potential GDP. 

Answer: G
