Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the photoelectric effect. Hmm, I remember that the photoelectric effect involves light shining on a material and causing electrons to be emitted. The key here is probably using the photoelectric equation.

The question says that ultraviolet light with a wavelength of 300 nm hits a material with a work function of 2.0 eV. I need to find the velocity of the emitted electrons. The options are given from A to J, all in terms of 10^6 m/s.

First, I should recall the photoelectric equation. I think it's something like the energy of the incoming photon equals the work function plus the kinetic energy of the emitted electron. So the equation would be:

Energy of photon (E_photon) = Work function (Φ) + Kinetic energy (KE) of electron.

So, E_photon = Φ + KE.

I can rearrange this to find the kinetic energy: KE = E_photon - Φ.

Now, I need to calculate E_photon. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

Wait, what are the values I should use? Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. The speed of light c is about 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 300 nm, which is 300 x 10^-9 meters, right? Because 1 nm is 1e-9 m.

So plugging in the numbers: E_photon = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3.0e8 m/s) / (300e-9 m).

Let me calculate that. Let's compute the numerator first: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Wait, no, because the units would be J·s * m/s = J·m. Then divide by meters, so J·m / m = J. So the energy is in joules.

So 1.9878e-25 J·m divided by 300e-9 m is 1.9878e-25 / 3e-7 = approximately 6.626e-19 J? Wait, let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25. Then divided by 300e-9 (which is 3e-7 m) gives 1.9878e-25 / 3e-7 = (1.9878 / 3) * 1e-18 = approximately 0.6626e-18 J, which is 6.626e-19 J.

Hmm, but wait, another way to calculate it. Alternatively, I could convert the energy into electron volts because the work function is given in eV. Maybe that would be easier since 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 joules.

So let me compute the photon energy in eV. The formula is E_photon (eV) = (1240 eV·nm) / λ (nm). Oh wait, I remember that 1240 is a convenient number for this calculation because hc ≈ 1240 eV·nm.

So λ is 300 nm. So E_photon = 1240 / 300 ≈ 4.1333 eV.

Wait, let me compute that: 1240 divided by 300 is 4.1333 eV. So that's the photon energy. The work function Φ is 2.0 eV.

So the kinetic energy of the electron is E_photon - Φ = 4.1333 eV - 2.0 eV = 2.1333 eV.

Now, I need to find the velocity of the electron. The kinetic energy in joules is KE = (2.1333 eV) * (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 3.416e-19 J.

The kinetic energy is also given by KE = (1/2) m v², where m is the mass of the electron (9.109e-31 kg) and v is the velocity.

So rearranging, v = sqrt(2 KE / m).

Plugging in the numbers:

KE = 3.416e-19 J.

m = 9.109e-31 kg.

So 2 * KE = 6.832e-19 J.

Divide by m: 6.832e-19 / 9.109e-31 ≈ approximately 7.5e11.

Take the square root: sqrt(7.5e11) ≈ 8.66e5 m/s.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

Wait, 6.832e-19 divided by 9.109e-31 is (6.832 / 9.109) * 1e12.

6.832 / 9.109 ≈ 0.75, so 0.75e12. So sqrt(0.75e12) is sqrt(7.5e11) ≈ 8.66e5 m/s, which is 0.866e6 m/s.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.87 ×10^6 m/s, which is very close to what I got. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, E_photon in eV: 1240 / 300 = 4.1333 eV. Subtract work function 2 eV, so KE is 2.1333 eV.

Convert to joules: 2.1333 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 3.416e-19 J.

Then, 2 KE / m = (2 * 3.416e-19) / 9.109e-31.

2 *3.416e-19 = 6.832e-19.

6.832e-19 / 9.109e-31 = approx 7.5e11.

sqrt(7.5e11) = sqrt(7.5) * sqrt(1e11) = 2.7386 * 3.1623e5 = 2.7386 * 3.1623e5 ≈ 8.66e5 m/s.

So that's 0.866e6 m/s, which rounds to 0.87e6 m/s, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should double-check the initial photon energy calculation.

Another approach: hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divided by λ=300e-9 m: 1.9878e-25 / 3e-7 = 6.626e-19 J.

Convert to eV: 6.626e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 4.133 eV. So that's correct.

So KE is 4.133 - 2.0 = 2.133 eV.

In joules: 2.133 * 1.602e-19 = 3.416e-19 J.

Then v = sqrt(2*3.416e-19 / 9.109e-31).

2*3.416e-19 = 6.832e-19.

6.832e-19 /9.109e-31 = (6.832 /9.109) * 1e12 ≈ 0.75e12 = 7.5e11.

sqrt(7.5e11) = approx 8.66e5 m/s.

So yes, option A is correct.

The problem involves using the photoelectric equation to determine the velocity of emitted electrons when ultraviolet light of 300 nm wavelength strikes a material with a work function of 2.0 eV. The photoelectric equation is:

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \Phi + KE
\]

where \(E_{\text{photon}}\) is the energy of the incoming photon, \(\Phi\) is the work function, and \(KE\) is the kinetic energy of the emitted electron. Rearranging for \(KE\):

\[
KE = E_{\text{photon}} - \Phi
\]

The energy of the photon is calculated using \(E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\), \(c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), and \(\lambda = 300 \, \text{nm} = 300 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}\). Substituting:

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.0 \times 10^8)}{300 \times 10^{-9}} = 6.626 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
\]

Converting to electron volts (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)):

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 4.133 \, \text{eV}
\]

The work function \(\Phi = 2.0 \, \text{eV}\), so the kinetic energy of the electron is:

\[
KE = 4.133 \, \text{eV} - 2.0 \, \text{eV} = 2.133 \, \text{eV}
\]

Converting \(KE\) to joules:

\[
KE = 2.133 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \approx 3.416 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
\]

The velocity of the electron is found using \(KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2\), where \(m = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg}\). Rearranging for \(v\):

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times KE}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 3.416 \times 10^{-19}}{9.109 \times 10^{-31}}}
\]

Calculating the numerator:

\[
2 \times 3.416 \times 10^{-19} = 6.832 \times 10^{-19}
\]

Dividing by \(m\):

\[
\frac{6.832 \times 10^{-19}}{9.109 \times 10^{-31}} \approx 7.5 \times 10^{11}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v = \sqrt{7.5 \times 10^{11}} \approx 8.66 \times 10^5 \, \text{m/s} = 0.866 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, \(v \approx 0.87 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s}\), which corresponds to option A.
