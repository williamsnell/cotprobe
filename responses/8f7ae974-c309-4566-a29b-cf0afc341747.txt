Question:

Acompressionalwave of frequency 250/sec is set up in an iron rod and passes from the rod into air. The speed of the wave is 1.6 x 10^4 ft/sec in iron and 1.1 x 10^3 ft/sec in air. Find the wavelength in each material.

Options:

A: 70 ft in iron, 3.5 ft in air
B: 68 ft in iron, 4.8 ft in air
C: 60 ft in iron, 5 ft in air
D: 80 ft in iron, 4.0 ft in air
E: 62 ft in iron, 4.2 ft in air
F: 72 ft in iron, 5.5 ft in air
G: 66 ft in iron, 4.6 ft in air
H: 75 ft in iron, 3.9 ft in air
I: 65 ft in iron, 4.5 ft in air
J: 64 ft in iron, 4.4 ft in air

Okay, so I need to find the wavelengths of a compressional wave in iron and air given the frequency and the wave speeds in each medium. Hmm, I remember that the wavelength is related to the speed of the wave and its frequency. Oh right, the formula is wavelength 位 = v / f, where v is the wave speed and f is the frequency.

The problem states that the frequency is 250 Hz (since it's per second). The wave is moving from iron to air, but since we're only asked about the wavelengths in each material, I can calculate them separately.

First, for the iron. The speed in iron is 1.6 x 10^4 ft/sec. So plugging into the formula, 位_iron = (1.6e4) / 250. Let me calculate that. 1.6e4 is 16,000 divided by 250. 16,000 divided by 250... Let me see, 16,000 divided by 100 is 160, so 250 is 2.5 times 100. So 160 divided by 2.5 is 64. So 位_iron is 64 feet.

Wait, no, wait. Because 250 times 64 is 16,000. Yes, that's correct. So iron's wavelength is 64 feet.

Now for the air. The speed in air is 1.1 x 10^3 ft/sec, which is 1,100 ft/s. Using the same formula, 位_air = 1,100 / 250. Let me compute that. 250 times 4 is 1,000. So 1,100 is 1,000 plus 100. So 4 plus (100/250). 100 divided by 250 is 0.4. So 4.4. Therefore, the wavelength in air is 4.4 feet.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one where iron has 64 ft and air has 4.4 ft. Let me check the options:

Option J is 64 ft in iron and 4.4 ft in air. That matches.

The wavelength in iron is calculated as \( \lambda_{\text{iron}} = \frac{1.6 \times 10^4}{250} = 64 \, \text{ft} \), and in air as \( \lambda_{\text{air}} = \frac{1.1 \times 10^3}{250} = 4.4 \, \text{ft} \). The correct option is J.

Answer: J
