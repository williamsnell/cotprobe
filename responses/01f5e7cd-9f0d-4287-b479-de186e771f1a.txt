Question:

Black-headed gulls remove broken eggshells from their nests immediately after the young have hatched. Explain the biological significance of this behavior.

Options:

A: Removing eggshells helps regulate the temperature within the nest for the chicks' comfort.
B: The gulls remove eggshells to keep their nests clean.
C: Eggshell-removing behavior reduces the chances of a nest being robbed, thus enhancing the survival of offspring.
D: Removing eggshells is a way to create space for the hatched chicks.
E: The eggshells are removed as a source of calcium for the gulls' diet.
F: Removing eggshells prevents the eggs from being eaten by predators.
G: The behavior is a social signal to other gulls that hatching has successfully occurred.
H: Removing eggshells is a way for the gulls to prepare the nest for future clutches of eggs.
I: The gulls remove eggshells to reduce the scent that may attract predators.

Okay, so I have this question about black-headed gulls and why they remove broken eggshells from their nests right after their young hatch. Hmm, I need to figure out the biological significance of this behavior. Let me think through the options one by one.

The question is multiple-choice, with options A through I. I remember that bird behaviors often have specific reasons related to survival or nest maintenance. So, let's go through each option.

Option A suggests that removing eggshells helps regulate nest temperature. I'm not sure about that. I mean, nests do need to maintain a certain temperature for the chicks, but does removing shells really affect that? Maybe not directly. I'll keep this in mind but not jump to conclusions yet.

Option B says the gulls remove shells to keep the nest clean. Keeping the nest clean is a plausible reason. Birds do tend to keep their nests tidy, which can prevent the buildup of bacteria or parasites. But is that the main reason for removing eggshells specifically? Not sure yet.

Option C claims that this behavior reduces the chances of the nest being robbed, thus enhancing offspring survival. Nest predation is a big issue for birds, so maybe eggshells could signal something to predators. If the shells are visible, maybe it attracts predators because it shows where a nest is. So removing them would hide the evidence, making the nest less obvious. That sounds plausible.

Option D is about creating space for the chicks. Well, after hatching, the chicks do need space to move around. Removing shells would definitely free up space, but is that the main reason the gulls do it? It seems like a practical benefit, but maybe it's more about other factors.

Option E suggests the eggshells are a calcium source. I know that birds need calcium, especially during breeding, but do they eat the eggshells? I'm not sure. Some birds might, but I think black-headed gulls specifically remove the shells rather than consuming them. So maybe E isn't the right answer.

Option F says removing shells prevents eggs from being eaten by predators. Wait, the eggs are hatched already, so this doesn't make much sense. The shells would be from hatched eggs, so the eggs themselves are gone. So F might not be correct.

Option G is about signaling to other gulls. Social signals are possible, but I'm not aware of this particular behavior being a signal. It seems more functional than a social cue.

Option H suggests preparing the nest for future clutches. That could be a reason, but if they're just clearing out the current shells, maybe it's more about immediate needs rather than future ones. Although, it's possible that keeping the nest clean would help with future nesting.

Option I says removing shells reduces the scent that attracts predators. The scent might be a factor. Eggshells could have a smell that predators detect, so removing them would reduce that odor, making the nest harder to find. That's another plausible option.

Now, I need to decide between C, I, and maybe B or D. Let me think more. The primary reason for removing eggshells is usually to prevent attracting predators. Predators like to look for nests with fresh eggs or chicks. If eggshells are left, they might indicate that a nest has recently hatched, making the area more vulnerable. So, the gulls remove them to avoid leaving a trace that predators could notice. That would support option C, which talks about reducing the chances of the nest being robbed, enhancing survival.

Alternatively, option I is about scent, and while that's possible, I think the more common reasoning is about visibility to predators. So maybe C is the better answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes it's about both scent and sight. However, the question is about the biological significance, and usually, the main reason for removing eggshells is to avoid attracting predators by hiding the evidence of a nest. So I think option C is the correct one.

The black-headed gulls remove broken eggshells from their nests immediately after the young hatch to reduce the chances of the nest being robbed by predators. This behavior enhances the survival of the offspring by making the nest less noticeable to potential threats. 

Answer: C
