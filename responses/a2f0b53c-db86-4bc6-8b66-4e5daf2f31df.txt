Okay, so I have this question about the percentage of children aged 13-15 in the United States who reported being in a physical fight at school one or more times in the past 12 months as of 2015. The options are from A to J, with various percentages.

First, I need to think about where to find this information. Since it's a specific statistic, it's probably from a reliable source like the CDC or the National Center for Education Statistics. I remember that the CDC conducts the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) which collects data on health risk behaviors among students. That might be the source here.

I think the YRBSS survey asks about physical fighting. From what I recall, the percentage isn't extremely high, but it's also not super low. Let me try to remember any reports I've come across. I think it was around 20-30%, but I'm not certain. Wait, maybe it's lower. I think the number was somewhere around 25%. Let me think again. If the options include 25%, that would be H.

Alternatively, maybe it's higher. I'm trying to remember if the rate was increasing or decreasing. I think in recent years, school violence has been decreasing, so maybe the percentage is lower than it was in the past. But I'm not entirely sure.

Looking at the options, H is 25%, G is 35%, F is 15%, etc. I'm more confident now that the answer is around 25%. So I'll go with H.

The answer is H: 25%.
