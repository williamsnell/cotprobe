Okay, so I've got this question about disjunctive syllogisms, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I remember that a disjunctive syllogism is a form of logical reasoning where the conclusion is drawn from two possible alternatives. The structure usually involves a major premise that presents two or more options connected by 'or', and then a minor premise that eliminates one of those options, leading to the conclusion that the remaining option must be true.

Looking at the options, I need to find which characteristic is true for a valid disjunctive syllogism.

Option A: The minor premise must either accept an alternative or reject an alternative. Hmm, that sounds a bit vague. The minor premise usually negates one of the alternatives, so maybe this is correct, but I'm not sure yet.

Option B: One of the premises is missing. I don't think that's right. A valid syllogism should have both premises and a conclusion, so missing a premise would make it invalid.

Option C: The major premise must either affirm the antecedent or deny the consequent. Wait, no, that sounds more like a hypothetical syllogism, not disjunctive. Disjunctive deals with 'or' statements, not conditionals.

Option D: It includes a conjunction in the major premise. Conjunctions are 'and' statements, and disjunctive syllogisms use 'or', so this doesn't fit.

Option E: It reaches a contradictory conclusion. No, valid syllogisms shouldn't have contradictory conclusions; they should be logically sound.

Option F: It includes a hypothetical premise. Again, that's more for hypothetical syllogisms, not disjunctive ones.

Option G: The major premise must either accept an alternative or reject an alternative. Wait, the major premise presents the alternatives, so it's about accepting or rejecting? I'm not sure. Maybe, but I need to think more.

Option H: The minor premise must either affirm the antecedent or deny the consequent. This is confusing. I think the minor premise in disjunctive syllogisms typically denies one alternative, not about antecedents or consequents.

Option I: The minor premise must either accept a conjunction or reject a conjunction. That doesn't make sense because disjunctive syllogisms deal with 'or' not 'and'.

Option J: It reaches a truthful conclusion. Well, logically valid syllogisms can have a truthful conclusion if the premises are true, but validity is about form, not content. So this might not be the right choice.

Let me think about the structure of a disjunctive syllogism. The major premise is a disjunction, like "Either A or B." The minor premise negates one of them, like "Not A," leading to the conclusion that "B must be true."

So in the minor premise, we're either accepting or rejecting one alternative. For example, if the major premise is "Either it's raining or it's sunny," and the minor premise is "It's not raining," then we conclude it's sunny. So the minor premise is rejecting one alternative and accepting the other.

Looking back at the options, option A says the minor premise must either accept an alternative or reject an alternative. That seems to fit because the minor premise is doing exactly thatâ€”either affirming one or denying the other.

Wait, but option G says the major premise must either accept or reject. No, the major premise presents the alternatives, it doesn't accept or reject; it's the minor premise that does that.

So I think option A is correct: the minor premise must either accept an alternative or reject an alternative.

The correct answer is A: The minor premise must either accept an alternative or reject an alternative. In a disjunctive syllogism, the minor premise negates one of the alternatives presented in the major premise, which is an 'or' statement. This process of elimination leads to the conclusion that the remaining alternative must be true. Therefore, the minor premise's role is to either accept or reject one of the alternatives.
