Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a proton moving in a magnetic field, and I need to find its speed. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when a charged particle moves in a magnetic field, it experiences a force that causes it to curve. The formula for that force is the Lorentz force, right? The formula I think is F = q(v × B), where q is the charge, v is the velocity, and B is the magnetic field.

Wait, but in this case, the proton is moving at right angles to the magnetic field. Oh right, when the velocity is perpendicular to the magnetic field, the force is maximum and acts as the centripetal force causing the proton to move in a circular path. So the magnetic force provides the necessary centripetal force. 

The formula for centripetal force is F = (mv²)/r, where m is mass, v is velocity, and r is the radius of curvature. So setting the magnetic force equal to the centripetal force, I get qvB = (mv²)/r. 

Let me write that down: qvB = mv² / r. Oh, because F = qvB (since sin(theta) is 1 when perpendicular) and F = mv²/r. So when I set them equal, I can cancel out the v on both sides. Wait, no, let me see: qvB = mv²/r. If I divide both sides by v, I get qB = mv/r. Then, solving for v, I rearrange to get v = (qB r) / m.

Wait, so v equals (charge times magnetic field times radius) divided by mass. That makes sense. I think that's the right formula.

So now I need to plug in the values. The charge of a proton is known, right? It's +e, where e is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. The magnetic field B is given as 1.0 weber per square meter, which is 1.0 tesla because 1 tesla equals 1 weber/m². The radius r is 0.22 meters. The mass of a proton m is about 1.67 x 10^-27 kilograms. 

Let me list the values:
- q = 1.602e-19 C
- B = 1.0 T
- r = 0.22 m
- m = 1.67e-27 kg

Plugging into the formula: v = (q * B * r) / m.

Calculating the numerator first: q * B * r = (1.602e-19 C) * 1.0 T * 0.22 m. Let's compute that. 1.602e-19 * 0.22 is approximately 3.5244e-20 (since 1.602 *0.22 is ~0.3524, so 0.3524e-19 = 3.524e-20). 

Then, dividing by m (1.67e-27 kg): 3.524e-20 / 1.67e-27. Let's compute this. 

3.524e-20 divided by 1.67e-27 is the same as (3.524 / 1.67) * 10^( -20 +27) = (approx 2.11) * 10^7. 

Wait, let me double-check that division. 3.524 divided by 1.67. So 1.67 times 2 is 3.34. 3.524 minus 3.34 is about 0.184. So 2.11 times 1.67? Let me check: 2 *1.67 is 3.34, 0.1 *1.67 is 0.167, so 3.34 + 0.167 = 3.507. Oh, that's close to 3.524, so yes, approx 2.11. 

So 2.11 times 10^7 m/s. Looking at the options, option I is 2.1e7 m/s, which matches. So I think the correct answer is I. 

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recalculate the numerator and denominator.

q * B * r = 1.602e-19 * 1.0 * 0.22 = 1.602 * 0.22 = 0.35244, so 3.5244e-20, yes. 

Then, m is 1.67e-27 kg.

So 3.5244e-20 / 1.67e-27 = (3.5244 / 1.67) * 1e7 (since 1e-20 /1e-27 is 1e7). 

3.5244 / 1.67: Let me calculate that more accurately. 

1.67 * 2 = 3.34. 3.5244 -3.34 = 0.1844. So 0.1844 left. 

So 0.1844 /1.67 ≈ 0.11. So total is 2.11. So 2.11e7 m/s. 

Looking at the options, option I is 2.1 x10^7, which matches. 

So the correct answer should be I.

To determine the speed of a proton moving in a magnetic field, we use the relationship between the magnetic force and centripetal force. The proton's speed is calculated using the formula:

\[
v = \frac{qBr}{m}
\]

where:
- \( q = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \) (charge of the proton),
- \( B = 1.0 \, \text{T} \) (magnetic field),
- \( r = 0.22 \, \text{m} \) (radius of curvature),
- \( m = 1.67 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \) (mass of the proton).

Substituting the values:

\[
v = \frac{(1.602 \times 10^{-19})(1.0)(0.22)}{1.67 \times 10^{-27}}
\]

\[
v \approx 2.11 \times 10^{7} \, \text{m/s}
\]

This matches option I, which is \( 2.1 \times 10^{7} \, \text{m/s} \).
