Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the frequency of a string under tension. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my wave mechanics, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem says: A string under a tension of 256 Newtons has a frequency of 100 vibrations per second. What happens to the frequency when the tension is changed to 144 Newtons? The options are A through J, with various frequencies listed.

First, I remember that the frequency of a vibrating string depends on the tension, the length of the string, and its mass. The formula that relates these factors is the wave equation. I think the formula for the frequency (f) of a string fixed at both ends is given by:

f = (1/(2L)) * sqrt(T/μ)

Where:
- T is the tension in the string,
- μ (mu) is the linear mass density (mass per unit length),
- L is the length of the string.

Wait, but in this problem, the string's length and mass (or μ) probably remain constant because only the tension is changing. So if L and μ don't change, then the frequency should be proportional to the square root of the tension. That makes sense because if you increase the tension, the string is tighter and can vibrate faster, right?

So, the initial frequency f1 is 100 vps (vibrations per second) with T1 = 256 N. The new tension is T2 = 144 N, and we need to find the new frequency f2.

Since f is proportional to sqrt(T), we can write the relationship as:

f2 / f1 = sqrt(T2 / T1)

Let me plug in the numbers. T1 is 256, T2 is 144.

So, f2 = f1 * sqrt(T2 / T1) = 100 * sqrt(144 / 256)

Calculating the fraction inside the square root: 144 divided by 256. Let me see, both are divisible by 16. 144 ÷16=9, 256 ÷16=16. So 9/16. The square root of 9 is 3, and the square root of 16 is 4. So sqrt(9/16)=3/4=0.75.

So f2 = 100 * 0.75 = 75 vps.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see option I is 75 vps. So is that the correct answer?

Let me double-check the calculations. T2 is 144, T1 is 256. 144/256 = (12^2)/(16^2) = (12/16)^2 = (3/4)^2. So square root is 3/4, so 0.75. Multiply by 100 gives 75. That seems right.

Wait, but another way to look at it: 144 is (12^2), and 256 is (16^2). So sqrt(144)=12, sqrt(256)=16. So sqrt(144/256)=12/16=3/4. Yep, same result.

So the new frequency is 75 vps. Looking at the options, yes, option I is 75vps. So the answer should be I.

The frequency of a string is proportional to the square root of the tension. Using the formula \( f_2 = f_1 \times \sqrt{\frac{T_2}{T_1}} \), we find the new frequency is 75 vps.
