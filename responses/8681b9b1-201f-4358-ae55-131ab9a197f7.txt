Alright, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the last three digits of 2003 raised to the power of (2002^2001). That's a massive exponent, so calculating it directly is impossible. I remember that to find the last three digits of a number, we're essentially looking for the number modulo 1000. So, the problem simplifies to finding 2003^(2002^2001) mod 1000.

First, I should note that 2003 mod 1000 is 3. So, the problem reduces to finding 3^(2002^2001) mod 1000. That seems a bit more manageable, but the exponent is still huge. I think Euler's theorem might come into play here, which is useful for calculating large exponents modulo a number.

Euler's theorem states that if two numbers are coprime, say a and n, then a^φ(n) ≡ 1 mod n, where φ(n) is Euler's totient function. So, I need to check if 3 and 1000 are coprime. Since 3 is a prime number and doesn't divide 1000, which is 2^3 * 5^3, they are indeed coprime. Therefore, Euler's theorem applies.

Calculating φ(1000): The totient function for a number n = p1^k1 * p2^k2 * ... is φ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ..., so for 1000 = 2^3 * 5^3, φ(1000) = 1000 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/5) = 1000 * 1/2 * 4/5 = 1000 * 2/5 = 400. So, φ(1000) = 400.

That means 3^400 ≡ 1 mod 1000. So, 3^k ≡ 3^(k mod 400) mod 1000. Therefore, to compute 3^(2002^2001) mod 1000, I can instead compute 3^( (2002^2001) mod 400 ) mod 1000.

Now, I need to find (2002^2001) mod 400. Let's simplify 2002 mod 400 first. Since 2000 is a multiple of 400 (400*5=2000), 2002 mod 400 is 2. So, 2002^2001 mod 400 is the same as 2^2001 mod 400.

Hmm, okay, now I have to compute 2^2001 mod 400. Let's see if there's a pattern or a cycle here. Maybe using Euler's theorem again, but first, check if 2 and 400 are coprime. 2 divides 400, so they are not coprime. Therefore, Euler's theorem doesn't apply directly here. Instead, perhaps I can break down 400 into its prime factors and use the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

400 factors into 16 * 25, which are 2^4 and 5^2, respectively. So, I can compute 2^2001 mod 16 and mod 25, then combine the results using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

First, compute 2^2001 mod 16. Since 2^4 = 16, any higher power of 2 beyond 4 will be 0 mod 16. So, 2^4 ≡ 0 mod 16, and thus 2^2001 ≡ 0 mod 16.

Next, compute 2^2001 mod 25. Since 2 and 25 are coprime, Euler's theorem applies. φ(25) = 20, because 25 is 5^2, so φ(25) = 25*(1 - 1/5) = 20. Therefore, 2^20 ≡ 1 mod 25. So, 2^2001 = 2^(20*100 + 1) = (2^20)^100 * 2^1 ≡ 1^100 * 2 ≡ 2 mod 25.

Now, we have:
- 2^2001 ≡ 0 mod 16
- 2^2001 ≡ 2 mod 25

We need to find a number x such that x ≡ 0 mod 16 and x ≡ 2 mod 25. Let's solve this system.

Let x = 16k, since x ≡ 0 mod 16. Then, substituting into the second equation: 16k ≡ 2 mod 25. So, 16k ≡ 2 mod 25. To solve for k, we can find the modular inverse of 16 mod 25.

The inverse of 16 mod 25 is a number m such that 16m ≡ 1 mod 25. Let's find m:

16 * m ≡ 1 mod 25
Trying m=11: 16*11=176. 176 ÷25=7*25=175, 176-175=1. So, 16*11 ≡1 mod25. Therefore, m=11.

Thus, k ≡ 2 * 11 mod25 => k ≡22 mod25. So, k=25t +22 for some integer t.

Therefore, x=16k=16*(25t +22)=400t +352. Thus, x ≡352 mod400.

So, 2^2001 mod400=352.

Therefore, going back to the original problem, 3^(2002^2001) mod1000 is equivalent to 3^352 mod1000.

Now, I need to compute 3^352 mod1000. This is still a large exponent, but perhaps I can compute it using exponentiation by squaring, breaking it down into smaller exponents.

Let's compute 3^352 mod1000:

First, note that 3^10 mod1000:
3^1=3
3^2=9
3^3=27
3^4=81
3^5=243
3^6=729
3^7=2187 mod1000=187
3^8=187*3=561
3^9=561*3=1683 mod1000=683
3^10=683*3=2049 mod1000=49

So, 3^10 ≡49 mod1000.

Now, let's compute higher powers using exponentiation by squaring:

Compute 3^10 ≡49
3^20 = (3^10)^2 ≡49^2=2401 mod1000=401
3^40=(3^20)^2 ≡401^2=160,801 mod1000=801
3^80=(3^40)^2 ≡801^2=641,601 mod1000=601
3^160=(3^80)^2 ≡601^2=361,201 mod1000=201

Now, 352 in binary is 256 + 64 + 32. Wait, 256+64=320, 320+32=352. So, 352 = 256 + 64 + 32.

So, 3^352 = 3^256 * 3^64 * 3^32.

We have 3^160 ≡201, so 3^256 = (3^160)^2 ≡201^2=40,401 mod1000=401.

3^64: Let's compute that. 3^64 = (3^32)^2. Let's compute 3^32 first.

Wait, I have 3^10=49, 3^20=401, 3^40=801, 3^80=601, 3^160=201.

But 3^32 is (3^16)^2. I don't have 3^16 yet. Let me compute 3^16.

3^10=49, 3^20=401, so 3^16=3^10 * 3^6. 3^6=729.

So, 3^16=49*729. Let's compute 49*729:

Compute 50*729=36,450. Subtract 729: 36,450 -729=35,721. 35,721 mod1000=721.

So, 3^16 ≡721 mod1000.

Then, 3^32 = (3^16)^2 =721^2. Let's compute 721^2:

700^2=490,000
2*700*21=2*700*21=29,400
21^2=441
Total: 490,000 +29,400=519,400 +441=519,841. mod1000=841.

So, 3^32 ≡841 mod1000.

Then, 3^64=(3^32)^2=841^2.

Compute 800^2=640,000
2*800*41=65,600
41^2=1,681
Total: 640,000 +65,600=705,600 +1,681=707,281. mod1000=281.

So, 3^64 ≡281 mod1000.

Similarly, 3^128=(3^64)^2=281^2.

280^2=78,400
2*280*1=560
1^2=1
Total:78,400 +560=78,960 +1=78,961. mod1000=961.

3^128 ≡961 mod1000.

But wait, I need 3^256: which is (3^128)^2=961^2.

960^2=921,600
2*960*1=1,920
1^2=1
Total:921,600 +1,920=923,520 +1=923,521. mod1000=521.

So, 3^256 ≡521 mod1000.

Wait, earlier I thought 3^256 was 401, but that was a mistake. Let me correct that.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the earlier step when I tried to compute 3^256 as (3^160)^2. Let's double-check that.

Wait, 3^160 is 201, so 3^256 would be (3^160)^2 =201^2=40,401 mod1000=401. But in the alternative approach using 3^32, 3^64, 3^128, etc., I got 3^256 as 521. There's a discrepancy here, so I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let me retrace:

From 3^10=49.

3^20=401.

3^40=(401)^2=160,801 mod1000=801.

3^80=(801)^2=641,601 mod1000=601.

3^160=(601)^2=361,201 mod1000=201.

So, 3^160=201.

Then, 3^256=3^(160+96)=3^160 * 3^96. Wait, maybe breaking it down differently is better.

Alternatively, 3^256=(3^128)^2. So, first compute 3^128.

3^64=281.

3^128=(281)^2=78,961 mod1000=961.

So, 3^128=961.

Then, 3^256=(961)^2=923,521 mod1000=521.

Wait, but according to the other approach, 3^256=(3^160)^2=201^2=40,401 mod1000=401.

But 3^256 can't be both 401 and 521. So, I must have made a mistake in one of the steps.

Wait, perhaps the error is in how I'm breaking down the exponents. Let me check 3^160 again.

3^160 is (3^80)^2=601^2=361,201 mod1000=201. That seems correct.

Then, 3^256 is (3^160)^2=201^2=40,401 mod1000=401.

But when I computed using 3^64=281, then 3^128=961, and 3^256=521. These two results are conflicting.

I must have made a mistake in one of the steps. Let me recompute 3^64.

3^32=841.

3^64=(841)^2. Compute 841*841.

Let me compute it step by step:

800*800=640,000

800*41=32,800

41*800=32,800

41*41=1,681

So, 841^2 = (800+41)^2 =800^2 + 2*800*41 +41^2=640,000 + 65,600 +1,681=640,000+65,600=705,600+1,681=707,281. mod1000=281. So, 3^64=281. Correct.

Then, 3^128=(281)^2. Let's compute 281^2:

200^2=40,000

2*200*81=32,400

81^2=6,561

Total:40,000+32,400=72,400+6,561=78,961. mod1000=961. So, 3^128=961.

Then, 3^256=(961)^2. Compute 961^2:

900^2=810,000

2*900*61=109,800

61^2=3,721

Total:810,000+109,800=919,800+3,721=923,521. mod1000=521.

So, according to this, 3^256=521. But earlier, via another path, I had 3^256=401.

This inconsistency indicates an error in one of the methods. Let's see: 3^160 is 201, so (3^160)^2=201^2=40,401 mod1000=401.

But from the other path, it's 521. So, which one is correct?

Wait, 3^256 is 3^(160+96)=3^160 *3^96. But 3^96 is (3^48)^2. Hmm, perhaps I should compute 3^96.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is in assuming that 3^160=201, but maybe that's incorrect. Let me double-check 3^160.

3^10=49.

3^20=401.

3^40= (401)^2=160,801 mod1000=801.

3^80=(801)^2=641,601 mod1000=601.

3^160=(601)^2=361,201 mod1000=201. So, 3^160=201 is correct.

Then, 3^256= (3^160)^2=201^2=40,401 mod1000=401.

But when I compute 3^256 via 3^128=961, then 3^256=961^2=521. So, which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponentiation when I thought 3^256 is (3^128)^2, but perhaps the correct way is that 3^256 is (3^128)^2, which would be 961^2=521. But according to the other method, it's 401. This discrepancy suggests an error in one of the paths.

Wait, perhaps the problem arises because 3^160 is 201, but 3^128 is 961, so 3^256 is both (3^160)^2=401 and (3^128)^2=521. That can't be. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in one of the steps.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing 3^128. Let me compute 3^64 again.

3^32=841.

3^64=(841)^2=707,281 mod1000=281. So, 3^64=281.

3^128=(281)^2=78,961 mod1000=961. So, correct.

Then, 3^256=(961)^2=923,521 mod1000=521.

But according to the other path, 3^256= (3^160)^2=201^2=401. This is a problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I broke down the exponents. Let's see: 3^256 is equal to (3^160)^2, which is correct because 160*2=320, but wait, 3^256 is 3^(160+96), which is 3^160 *3^96, but 3^96 is (3^48)^2. Alternatively, perhaps using the exponentiation by squaring, it's better to compute 3^352 directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the Chinese Remainder Theorem again, but I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 3^352 mod 8 and mod 125, then combine the results using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, since 1000=8*125 and 8 and 125 are coprime.

First, compute 3^352 mod8.

Since 3 mod8=3. 3^1=3, 3^2=9≡1 mod8. So, 3^2≡1 mod8, so 3^even exponent≡1 mod8. 352 is even, so 3^352 ≡1 mod8.

Next, compute 3^352 mod125.

Since 3 and 125 are coprime, Euler's theorem applies. φ(125)=100, because 125 is 5^3, so φ(125)=125*(1-1/5)=100.

Thus, 3^100 ≡1 mod125. Therefore, 3^352=3^(3*100 +52)= (3^100)^3 *3^52 ≡1^3 *3^52 ≡3^52 mod125.

Now, compute 3^52 mod125.

Let's compute 3^1=3 mod125=3
3^2=9
3^4=81
3^8=81^2=6561 mod125. Let's compute 6561 ÷125: 125*52=6500, 6561-6500=61. So, 3^8≡61 mod125.

3^16=(3^8)^2=61^2=3721 mod125. 125*29=3625, 3721-3625=96. So, 3^16≡96 mod125.

3^32=(3^16)^2=96^2=9216 mod125. 125*73=9125, 9216-9125=91. So, 3^32≡91 mod125.

Now, 3^52=3^32 *3^16 *3^4. Let's compute each part:

3^32=91
3^16=96
3^4=81

So, 91*96 mod125. Let's compute 91*96:

90*96=8640
1*96=96
Total=8640+96=8736. Now, 8736 mod125.

125*69=8625, 8736-8625=111. So, 91*96≡111 mod125.

Then, multiply by 3^4=81:

111*81 mod125.

Compute 100*81=8100, 11*81=891. So, 8100+891=8991.

8991 mod125: 125*71=8875, 8991-8875=116. So, 3^52≡116 mod125.

Thus, 3^352 ≡116 mod125 and ≡1 mod8.

Now, we need to find a number x such that x≡116 mod125 and x≡1 mod8.

Let x=125k +116. We need this to satisfy x≡1 mod8.

Compute 125k +116 mod8.

125 mod8: 125 ÷8=15*8=120, 125-120=5. So, 125≡5 mod8.

116 mod8: 116 ÷8=14*8=112, 116-112=4. So, 116≡4 mod8.

Thus, x=5k +4 ≡1 mod8.

So, 5k +4 ≡1 mod8 → 5k ≡-3 ≡5 mod8.

So, 5k≡5 mod8 → Multiply both sides by the inverse of 5 mod8. The inverse of 5 mod8 is 5, because 5*5=25≡1 mod8.

Thus, k≡5*5=25≡1 mod8. So, k=8m +1 for some integer m.

Therefore, x=125*(8m +1) +116=1000m +125 +116=1000m +241.

So, x≡241 mod1000.

Therefore, 3^352 ≡241 mod1000.

Wait, but earlier I thought 3^352 was 521, but that seems to have been an error because of conflicting methods. Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem approach, I get 241.

Wait, but let me check this again because I might have made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, when I computed 3^52 mod125, I got 116. Let me double-check that.

3^1=3
3^2=9
3^4=81
3^8=81^2=6561 mod125=61
3^16=61^2=3721 mod125=96
3^32=96^2=9216 mod125=91
3^52=3^32 *3^16 *3^4=91*96*81.

Wait, 91*96 mod125: Let's compute 91*96.

Compute 90*96=8640, 1*96=96. Total=8736. 8736 ÷125=69*125=8625, 8736-8625=111. So, 91*96=111 mod125.

Then, 111*81 mod125.

Compute 111*80=8880, 111*1=111. Total=8880+111=8991.

Now, 8991 ÷125=71*125=8875, 8991-8875=116. So, 3^52≡116 mod125.

Thus, 3^352≡116 mod125 and ≡1 mod8, leading to x≡241 mod1000.

Therefore, the last three digits of 2003^(2002^2001) are 241.

Looking back at the options, option J is 241.
</think>

To find the last three digits of \(2003^{2002^{2001}}\), we compute \(2003^{2002^{2001}} \mod 1000\). Since \(2003 \equiv 3 \mod 1000\), the problem reduces to finding \(3^{2002^{2001}} \mod 1000\).

Using Euler's theorem, since \(3\) and \(1000\) are coprime, and \(\phi(1000) = 400\), we have \(3^{400} \equiv 1 \mod 1000\). Thus, \(3^{2002^{2001}} \equiv 3^{(2002^{2001} \mod 400)} \mod 1000\).

Simplifying \(2002^{2001} \mod 400\):
- \(2002 \equiv 2 \mod 400\), so \(2002^{2001} \equiv 2^{2001} \mod 400\).
- Compute \(2^{2001} \mod 400\) using the Chinese Remainder Theorem:
  - \(2^{2001} \equiv 0 \mod 16\) (since \(2^4 = 16\)).
  - \(2^{2001} \equiv 2 \mod 25\) (using Euler's theorem, \(\phi(25) = 20\), so \(2^{2001} \equiv 2^{1} \equiv 2 \mod 25\)).
- Combining these, \(2^{2001} \equiv 352 \mod 400\).

Thus, \(3^{2002^{2001}} \equiv 3^{352} \mod 1000\).

To compute \(3^{352} \mod 1000\):
- Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem:
  - \(3^{352} \equiv 1 \mod 8\) (since \(3^2 \equiv 1 \mod 8\) and \(352\) is even).
  - \(3^{352} \equiv 116 \mod 125\) (using Euler's theorem, \(\phi(125) = 100\), so \(3^{352} \equiv 3^{52} \equiv 116 \mod 125\)).
- Combining these, \(3^{352} \equiv 241 \mod 1000\).

Therefore, the last three digits are **241**.

Answer: J
