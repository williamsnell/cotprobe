Okay, so I have this question about gradient descent and the cost of one update step. Hmm, let me think.

The question says that we've computed the gradient of the cost function and stored it in a vector g. Now, what's the cost of one gradient descent update? The options are various big O notations, so it's about time complexity.

Wait, gradient descent involves updating the parameters. Normally, gradient descent does something like theta = theta - learning_rate * g, right? So each parameter is updated by subtracting the gradient multiplied by the learning rate.

But the cost here refers to the computational complexity of performing that update. So how much computation does it take to do one step?

Let me break it down. The gradient g is a vector, so its size depends on the number of parameters D. For example, if we're doing linear regression with D features, g will have D elements.

Updating each parameter in theta would be a simple subtraction for each element. So for each of the D parameters, we do a single arithmetic operation. That would be O(D) time, right? Because for each element in g, you just add or subtract.

Wait, but wait a second. The options don't have O(D) as the only one. Let me check the options again. Oh, option I is O(D), and option J is O(D²), etc.

But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It says, "the cost of one gradient descent update given the gradient." So the gradient is already computed. So the update itself is just taking that gradient and applying it to the parameters.

If the gradient has D elements, then the update requires D operations—each parameter is updated once. So the time complexity is O(D), which is option I.

But wait, could there be any other factors? Like if the cost function is more complex, but the question states that the gradient is already computed and stored in g. So the update step is just applying the gradient, which is O(D).

Alternatively, maybe the confusion is between the cost of computing the gradient and the cost of the update. Computing the gradient would involve more steps, like in backpropagation, which could be O(N) for data points or O(D^2) or something else. But the question is specifically about the cost of the gradient descent update, not computing the gradient.

So the update step is O(D) time, which is option I.

The cost of one gradient descent update is determined by the number of parameters in the gradient vector. Since the gradient is a vector of size D, updating each parameter involves D simple arithmetic operations. Therefore, the time complexity is O(D).
