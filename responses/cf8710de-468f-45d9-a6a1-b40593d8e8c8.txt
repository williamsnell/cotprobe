Alright, let's try to solve this problem step by step. So, we have a stainless steel pipe with an inner diameter (I.D.) of 6 inches and an outer diameter (O.D.) of 6.5 inches. It's insulated with a 3.5-inch thick layer of insulation material. The inner surface of the pipe is at 500°F, and the outer surface of the insulation is at 150°F. We need to find the rate of heat loss per foot length of the pipe and the temperature at the interface between the pipe and the insulation.

First, I should probably visualize the setup. There's a pipe made of stainless steel, which is a good conductor, so heat will transfer through it. Then, there's an insulating layer around it, which is a poor conductor, reducing heat loss. The heat flows from the hot inner surface (500°F) to the outer insulation surface (150°F). 

Since the system is cylindrical, the heat transfer can be analyzed using the cylindrical wall formula. The formula for steady-state, one-dimensional heat conduction through multiple layers is based on the thermal resistances in series.

The general formula for the rate of heat transfer (Q) is:

Q = (T_in - T_out) / (R_total) 

Where R_total is the sum of the thermal resistances of each layer.

Each layer's thermal resistance (R) for a cylindrical wall is given by:

R = ln(Do/Di) / (2πkL)

Where:
- Do is the outer diameter
- Di is the inner diameter
- k is the thermal conductivity
- L is the length of the pipe (we'll take L=1 ft since we need per foot)
- π is pi, approximately 3.1416

Wait, but wait, the problem is that there are two materials here: the steel pipe and the insulation. So the total thermal resistance is the sum of the resistances of each material.

So first, let's find the dimensions for each layer.

The pipe's inner diameter is 6 inches (I.D.), so its inner radius r1 is 3 inches. The pipe's outer diameter is 6.5 inches, so its outer radius r2 is 3.25 inches. Then, the insulation has a thickness of 3.5 inches, so the outer radius of the insulation is r3 = r2 + 3.5 inches = 3.25 + 3.5 = 6.75 inches.

Wait, but the pipe's outer diameter is 6.5 inches, so the insulation is added outside, so the insulation's inner radius is 3.25 inches, and it's 3.5 inches thick, so the insulation's outer radius is 3.25 + 3.5 = 6.75 inches.

Wait, but the outer surface of the insulation is at 150°F, which is the outside of the insulation. So the heat flows from 500°F at the pipe's inner surface to 150°F at the insulation's outer surface.

So the heat must pass through two layers: the steel pipe and the insulation.

Wait, but wait a minute. The steel pipe is a conductor, and the insulation is a resistor. So the two layers are in series, so their thermal resistances add up.

So, let's compute the thermal resistances for each layer.

First, for the steel pipe:

The steel layer is from r1 = 3 inches to r2 = 3.25 inches. So the inner radius is 3 inches, outer is 3.25 inches.

The thermal resistance R_steel is:

R_steel = ln(r2/r1) / (2πk_steel * L)

Similarly, for the insulation layer, which goes from r2 = 3.25 inches to r3 = 6.75 inches.

R_insulation = ln(r3/r2) / (2πk_insulation * L)

Then, the total resistance R_total = R_steel + R_insulation.

Once we have R_total, the rate of heat loss per foot is:

Q = (T_inner - T_insulation_outer) / R_total 

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, the formula is Q = (T_hot - T_cold) / R_total. But wait, the steel pipe is at 500°F on the inside, and the insulation's outer surface is at 150°F. So the temperature difference is 500 - 150 = 350°F.

So, the total thermal resistance R_total is R_steel + R_insulation.

But let's plug in the numbers.

First, let's convert all the radii from inches to feet because the thermal conductivity is in Btu/hr-ft-°F, and we're calculating per foot length. So L=1 ft.

Wait, but the radii are in inches. Let's convert them to feet.

r1 = 3 inches = 3/12 = 0.25 ft

r2 = 3.25 inches = 3.25/12 ≈ 0.2708 ft

r3 = 6.75 inches = 6.75/12 ≈ 0.5625 ft

Now, compute R_steel:

k_steel = 26 Btu/hr-ft-°F

R_steel = ln(r2/r1) / (2πk_steel * L)

r2/r1 = 0.2708 / 0.25 ≈ 1.0832

ln(1.0832) ≈ 0.07977

So R_steel = 0.07977 / (2 * π * 26 * 1)

Calculate denominator: 2 * 3.1416 ≈6.2832; 6.2832 *26 ≈163.3632

So R_steel ≈ 0.07977 / 163.3632 ≈ 0.000488 °F/(Btu/hr)

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the units: since Q is in Btu per hour, and R has units of °F/(Btu/hr).

Wait, maybe it's better to keep track more carefully.

But perhaps let's proceed with the numbers.

Next, R_insulation:

k_insulation = 0.04 Btu/hr-ft-°F

r3 = 0.5625 ft, r2=0.2708 ft

r3/r2 = 0.5625 / 0.2708 ≈ 2.078

ln(2.078) ≈ 0.731

R_insulation = 0.731 / (2π * 0.04 * 1)

Denominator: 2 * 3.1416 ≈6.2832; 6.2832 * 0.04 ≈0.2513

So R_insulation ≈ 0.731 / 0.2513 ≈ 2.909 °F/(Btu/hr)

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 0.731 divided by 0.2513 is about 2.909? Let me check: 0.2513 *2 = 0.5026, 0.2513*3=0.7539. So 0.731 is between 2.9 and 3.0 times 0.2513? Let me compute 0.2513 *2.9=0.729, which is close to 0.731. So R_insulation ≈2.909 °F/(Btu/hr).

Wait, but I'm getting R_steel as about 0.000488, which seems very low, and R_insulation as about 2.909. So the total R_total is about 2.91 + 0.000488 ≈2.910488 °F/(Btu/hr).

Then, the heat flow Q is (500 -150) / R_total = 350 / 2.910488 ≈ 120.27 Btu/hr per foot.

Wait, looking at the options, option D is 120.28 Btu/hr per foot, and temperature at interface is 501.88°F. Option G is 120.28 with 499.88°F.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, R_steel calculation: ln(r2/r1) is ln(0.2708/0.25)=ln(1.0832)= approx 0.0798.

Denominator: 2πk_steel * L = 2 * 3.1416 * 26 *1 = 163.362.

So R_steel = 0.0798 / 163.362 ≈ 0.000488.

R_insulation: ln(0.5625/0.2708)=ln(2.078)= approx 0.731.

Denominator: 2π *0.04 *1= 0.2513.

R_insulation=0.731 /0.2513≈2.909.

So R_total=0.000488 +2.909≈2.9095.

Then Q=350 /2.9095 ≈120.28 Btu/hr per foot.

So the heat loss per foot is about 120.28 Btu/hr, matching options D and G. Now, what about the temperature at the interface, which is the outer surface of the steel pipe (inner surface of insulation), i.e., at r2=3.25 inches, which is 0.2708 ft.

We can calculate this temperature by using the heat flux (q), which is the heat flow per unit area. Alternatively, using the formula for temperature at a point in a series of resistances.

The temperature at the interface is T_interface = T_inner - (R_steel * Q)

Wait, but Q is the heat flow, which is in Btu/hr per foot. Let me think again.

Wait, the heat flows through each layer. So the temperature drop across the steel layer is (R_steel * Q), and the temperature drop across the insulation is (R_insulation * Q). So T_interface = T_inner - (R_steel * Q)

But wait, let me write it properly.

The total temperature difference is 350°F across both layers. The steel's R is 0.000488, and the insulation's R is 2.909, so the steel accounts for a very small part of the total resistance. So most of the temperature drop is across the insulation.

Let me compute the temperature at the interface (T Interface) as T_steel_outer = T_steel_inner - (R_steel * Q)

But wait, Q is the heat flow rate per foot, so:

Q = 350 / R_total ≈350 /2.9095≈120.28 Btu/hr-ft.

Then, T Interface = T_steel_inner - (R_steel * Q)

But wait, T_steel_inner is 500°F. So:

T Interface = 500 - (0.000488 * 120.28) 

Compute 0.000488 *120.28 = approx 0.0587 °F.

So T Interface ≈500 -0.0587≈499.9413°F.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G's interface temperature is 499.88°F, and option D is 501.88. Hmm, but my calculation gives about 499.94, which is close to 499.94, but the options don't have that exact number.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the R_steel and R_insulation calculations.

Wait, let's calculate R_steel again:

r1 = 0.25 ft, r2=0.2708 ft.

r2/r1 = 0.2708 / 0.25 = 1.0832.

ln(1.0832) ≈0.07977.

Denominator: 2π *26 = 2*3.1416*26≈163.362.

So R_steel =0.07977 /163.362≈0.000488.

R_insulation: r3=0.5625 ft, r2=0.2708 ft.

r3/r2≈2.078.

ln(2.078)=0.731.

Denominator: 2π *0.04=0.2513.

R_insulation=0.731/0.2513≈2.909.

So R_total=2.909+0.000488≈2.9095.

Then, Q=350 /2.9095≈120.28 Btu/hr-ft.

Now, T Interface = T_steel_inner - (R_steel * Q) 

Compute R_steel * Q: 0.000488 *120.28≈0.0587.

So T Interface =500 -0.0587≈499.9413°F.

Looking at the options, the closest is option G: 120.28 Btu/hr-ft, 499.88°F. But my calculation gives 499.94, which is approximately 499.94°F. Option I is 503.88, which is higher. Option G's temp is 499.88, which is close to my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the ln values.

Let me recalculate ln(1.0832) more accurately.

Using a calculator, ln(1.083333)=approx 0.07978.

Similarly, ln(2.078)≈0.73105.

So, R_steel=0.07978/(2π*26)=0.07978/(163.362)=approx 0.000488.

R_insulation=0.73105/(2π*0.04)=0.73105/(0.25133)=2.909.

So R_total=2.9095.

Q=350/2.9095= approx 120.28.

Now, T Interface=500 - (R_steel * Q)=500 - (0.000488 *120.28)=500 -0.0587≈499.9413.

Looking at the options, option J is 130.28, which doesn't match. Option G has 120.28 and 499.88. Hmm, perhaps the exact calculation would yield a slightly different value.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the steel's thermal resistance is negligible, so the majority of the temperature drop is in the insulation. Let me see:

If R_steel is negligible, then R_total≈2.909.

Then Q=350/2.909≈120.28.

T Interface=500 - (R_steel * Q)=500 - (0.000488 *120.28)=500 -0.0587=499.9413.

So the closest option is G: 120.28 Btu/hr-ft and 499.88°F. But my calculation gives 499.94, which is close to 499.94, but the option is 499.88. Hmm, perhaps due to more precise calculations, let me check if the exact value is closer.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the radius conversion. Let's check:

r1 =6 in. I.D. → r=3 in=0.25 ft.

r2=6.5 in O.D. → r=3.25 in=0.2708 ft.

r3= r2 +3.5 in =3.25+3.5=6.75 in=0.5625 ft.

So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for thermal resistance for the steel is different because the steel's outer radius is r2, and the insulation's inner radius is r2. So perhaps the steel's R is ln(r2/r1) / (2πk_steel).

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Compute R_steel:

ln(3.25/3) = ln(1.083333333).

Using more precise calculation, ln(1.083333333)= approx 0.079787.

So R_steel=0.079787/(2π*26)=0.079787/(163.362)= approx 0.000488.

R_insulation=ln(6.75/6.5)/(2π*0.04) → Wait, no. Wait, the insulation's inner radius is r2=3.25 in=0.2708 ft, and outer radius is r3=6.75 in=0.5625 ft.

So the ratio is r3/r2=0.5625/0.2708=2.078.

ln(2.078)=0.73105.

So R_insulation=0.73105/(2π*0.04)=0.73105/(0.25133)=2.909.

So R_total=2.909 + 0.000488=2.909488.

Q=350/2.909488= approx 120.28.

Now, T Interface=500 - (0.000488 *120.28)=500 -0.0587≈499.94°F.

Looking at the options:

Option G: 120.28 Btu/hr-ft, 499.88°F.

Option J:130.28 Btu/hr-ft, 498.88°F.

Wait, but my calculation gives 499.94, which is closest to 499.94. But the options don't have that exact value. Option G's interface temp is 499.88, which is 0.06°F lower. Perhaps due to rounding during calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

Let me compute R_steel and R_insulation with more precise numbers.

Compute R_steel:

r1=3 in=0.25 ft.

r2=3.25 in=0.270833333 ft.

r2/r1=3.25/3=1.083333333.

ln(1.083333333)=0.079787255.

Denominator: 2 * π *26 =2 *3.1415926535 *26=163.3613253.

R_steel=0.079787255 / 163.3613253≈0.000488.

R_insulation:

r3=6.75 in=0.5625 ft.

r2=0.270833333 ft.

r3/r2=0.5625/0.270833333≈2.078.

ln(2.078)=0.73105.

Denominator: 2 * π *0.04=0.251327412.

R_insulation=0.73105 / 0.251327412≈2.909.

So R_total=2.909 + 0.000488=2.909488.

Q=350 /2.909488=120.28.

Now, T Interface=500 - (R_steel * Q) =500 - (0.000488 *120.28).

Compute 0.000488 *120.28:

0.000488 *120=0.05856

0.000488 *0.28=0.00013664

Total=0.05856 +0.00013664≈0.05869664°F.

So T Interface=500 -0.05869664≈499.9413°F.

Looking at the options again, the closest is option G: 120.28 Btu/hr-ft, 499.88°F. But 499.9413 is about 499.94, which is 0.06 higher than option G's 499.88.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the insulation's R. Let me check the insulation's radii again.

Insulation's inner radius is r2=3.25 inches=0.2708333 ft.

Outer radius is r3=6.75 inches=0.5625 ft.

So r3/r2=0.5625/0.2708333=2.078.

But perhaps I should use more precise values. Let me compute 0.5625 / 0.2708333.

0.5625 ÷ 0.2708333 = approx 2.078.

But let me check with exact division: 0.5625 ÷ 0.2708333.

0.2708333 is 3.25/12=0.270833333.

So 0.5625 / (3.25/12) = 0.5625 *12/3.25 = (6.75)/3.25 ≈2.078.

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the options have a typo, or perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the steel's R is so small that the temperature drop is negligible, so the interface is almost at 500°F. Looking at the options, option G and D have 120.28 Btu/hr-ft, but D's interface temp is 501.88, which would imply a negative R_steel, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, no, that can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Wait, no. The formula is correct: T Interface = T_inner - (R_steel * Q).

Wait, but let's think again: the heat flows from inner to outer. The steel's R is so low that the temperature drop across it is minimal. So the interface should be almost at 500°F, close to the inner surface.

Looking at the options, option G has 499.88°F, which is a drop of about 0.12°F, which is possible with more precise calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the temperature drop across the steel more precisely.

Compute R_steel * Q:

R_steel=0.000488, Q=120.28.

0.000488 *120.28 = exactly:

0.000488 *120=0.05856.

0.000488 *0.28=0.00013664.

Total=0.05856 +0.00013664=0.05869664.

So T Interface=500 -0.05869664=499.9413°F.

Looking at the options, none have exactly 499.94. The closest is option G:499.88.

But wait, maybe I should use exact values without approximations.

Let me compute R_steel and R_insulation with more precision.

R_steel:

ln(3.25/3)=ln(1.083333333)=0.079787255.

Denominator=2π*26=163.3613253.

R_steel=0.079787255 /163.3613253= approx 0.000488.

R_insulation:

ln(6.75/6.5)=ln(1.03846154)=0.03779.

Wait, wait a minute! Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Earlier, I thought that the insulation's inner radius is 3.25 inches, which is 0.2708 ft, and the outer radius is 6.75 inches=0.5625 ft. So the ratio is 0.5625/0.2708=2.078, ln(2.078)=0.731.

Wait, but wait, no, that's correct. But earlier, I thought that the outer radius of the insulation is 6.75 inches, but perhaps the outer diameter of the insulation is 6.75 inches, making the radius 3.375 inches. Wait, no, wait: the insulation has a thickness of 3.5 inches, so outer diameter is 6.5 + 2*3.5=6.5 +7=13.5 inches? No, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait: the pipe's outer diameter is 6.5 inches, so its radius is 3.25 inches. The insulation is 3.5 inches thick, so the outer radius is 3.25 +3.5=6.75 inches, so the outer diameter is 13.5 inches. So that part is correct.

So, the ratio for the insulation is r3/r2=6.75/3.25=2.078, so ln(2.078)=0.731.

Wait, but perhaps there's a mistake in thinking about the formula. The formula for R_insulation is ln(r3/r2)/(2πk_insulation*L).

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute R_insulation as ln(r3/r2)/(2πk_insulation).

Wait, let's compute exact values.

Compute R_insulation:

r3=0.5625 ft, r2=0.2708333 ft.

r3/r2=0.5625 /0.2708333=2.078.

ln(2.078)=0.73105.

Denominator:2π*0.04=0.251327412.

R_insulation=0.73105 /0.251327412=2.909.

So R_total=2.909 +0.000488=2.909488.

So Q=350 /2.909488=120.28.

Then, T Interface=500 - (0.000488 *120.28)=500 -0.0587=499.9413.

Looking at the options, the closest one is option G:120.28 Btu/hr-ft, 499.88°F.

But 499.94 is not exactly 499.88, so perhaps I should check if I made a mistake in the R_steel calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate R_steel more accurately.

Compute R_steel:

ln(3.25/3)=ln(1.083333333)=0.079787255.

Denominator:2π*26=163.3613253.

R_steel=0.079787255 /163.3613253= approx 0.000488.

But perhaps more precisely:

0.079787255 ÷163.3613253.

Let me compute that:

163.3613253 *0.000488 = approx 0.079787255.

So R_steel=0.000488.

So, exact calculation gives 0.000488, so no mistake there.

Thus, the interface temp is approximately 499.94°F, which is closest to option G's 499.88°F.

Wait, but perhaps the options have rounded the numbers. Let me see option G:120.28, 499.88.

But my calculation is 499.94, which is 0.06°F higher than option G's 499.88.

Alternatively, perhaps the steel's R is 0.000488, and the insulation's R is 2.909, so R_total=2.909488.

Q=350 /2.909488=120.28.

Then, the temperature drop across steel is R_steel*Q=0.000488 *120.28≈0.0587°F.

So T Interface=500 -0.0587=499.9413.

But none of the options have this exact value. So perhaps the correct option is G:120.28, 499.88.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the steel's R is negligible, so the interface temp is almost 500°F, which would make option G the correct one.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the other options. Option D is 120.28 and 501.88, which would imply a temperature rise, which doesn't make sense because heat is flowing out, so the interface should be cooler than 500°F.

So, the only plausible options are G and J.

Option J:130.28, 498.88.

But my calculation for Q is 120.28, so J's Q is 130.28, which is higher. So perhaps that's incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is option G:120.28 Btu/hr-ft, 499.88°F.

To solve the problem, we analyze the heat transfer through the steel pipe and the insulation using the cylindrical wall formula for steady-state, one-dimensional heat conduction. The total thermal resistance is the sum of the resistances of the steel and insulation layers. The rate of heat loss per foot length is calculated using the total resistance, and the temperature at the interface is determined by the temperature drop across the steel layer.

### Step 1: Dimensions in feet
- Inner radius of steel pipe: \( r_1 = \frac{6}{12} = 0.25 \, \text{ft} \)
- Outer radius of steel pipe: \( r_2 = \frac{6.5}{12} \approx 0.2708 \, \text{ft} \)
- Outer radius of insulation: \( r_3 = r_2 + 3.5 = 3.25 + 3.5 = 6.75 \, \text{in} = 0.5625 \, \text{ft} \)

### Step 2: Thermal resistances
The thermal resistance for each layer is given by:
\[
R = \frac{\ln\left(\frac{r_{\text{outer}}}{r_{\text{inner}}}\right)}{2 \pi k L}
\]
- For steel (\( k_{\text{steel}} = 26 \, \text{Btu/hr-ft}^\circ\text{F} \)):
\[
R_{\text{steel}} = \frac{\ln\left(\frac{0.2708}{0.25}\right)}{2 \pi \cdot 26 \cdot 1} = \frac{\ln(1.0832)}{163.362} \approx \frac{0.0798}{163.362} \approx 0.000488 \, \text{°F/(Btu/hr)}
\]
- For insulation (\( k_{\text{insulation}} = 0.04 \, \text{Btu/hr-ft}^\circ\text{F} \)):
\[
R_{\text{insulation}} = \frac{\ln\left(\frac{0.5625}{0.2708}\right)}{2 \pi \cdot 0.04 \cdot 1} = \frac{\ln(2.078)}{0.2513} \approx \frac{0.731}{0.2513} \approx 2.909 \, \text{°F/(Btu/hr)}
\]

### Step 3: Total resistance and heat loss
\[
R_{\text{total}} = R_{\text{steel}} + R_{\text{insulation}} \approx 0.000488 + 2.909 \approx 2.9095 \, \text{°F/(Btu/hr)}
\]
The rate of heat loss per foot:
\[
Q = \frac{T_{\text{inner}} - T_{\text{outer}}}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{500 - 150}{2.9095} \approx \frac{350}{2.9095} \approx 120.28 \, \text{Btu/hr-ft}
\]

### Step 4: Temperature at the interface
The temperature at the interface (outer surface of steel, inner surface of insulation) is:
\[
T_{\text{interface}} = T_{\text{inner}} - (R_{\text{steel}} \cdot Q)
\]
\[
T_{\text{interface}} = 500 - (0.000488 \cdot 120.28) \approx 500 - 0.0587 \approx 499.94 \, \text{°F}
\]

### Step 5: Closest option
The calculated heat loss is \( 120.28 \, \text{Btu/hr-ft} \), and the interface temperature is approximately \( 499.94 \, \text{°F} \). Among the options, the closest match is:

**G: 120.28 Btu/hr-ft, 499.88°F**
