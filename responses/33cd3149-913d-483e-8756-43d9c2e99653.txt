Okay, so Mrs. Ash wants to save money for her daughter's education. She's thinking about setting up a savings account and needs to figure out how much she should deposit each year. The goal is to have $20,000 after 17 years, and the account earns 5% interest annually. 

Hmm, I remember that when you're saving a fixed amount each year with compound interest, it's called an ordinary annuity. So I think I need to use the future value of an ordinary annuity formula. Let me recall the formula: 

FV = PMT * [( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) / r ]

Where:
- FV is the future value, which is $20,000 here.
- PMT is the annual payment or deposit she makes.
- r is the annual interest rate, which is 5% or 0.05.
- n is the number of years, so 17 years.

She wants to find the PMT, so I need to rearrange the formula to solve for PMT. That would be:

PMT = FV / [ ( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) / r ]

Let me plug in the numbers. 

First, calculate (1 + 0.05)^17. Let me see, 1.05 to the power of 17. I'm not exactly sure what that is, but I can approximate it or maybe use logarithms. Alternatively, I can think that each year the amount grows by 5%. 

Wait, maybe I should just calculate it step by step. Let me compute (1.05)^17. I think 1.05^10 is about 1.6289, and then 1.05^17 would be 1.05^10 * 1.05^7. 

I know that 1.05^7 is approximately 1.4071. So 1.6289 * 1.4071 ≈ 2.299. Hmm, that's a rough estimate. Alternatively, maybe I should use a calculator, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll proceed with the approximate value.

Wait, perhaps I should remember that the exact value of (1.05)^17 can be found using logarithms or a more precise method. Let me try to compute it more accurately. 

Alternatively, maybe I can find a table or use the rule of 72 to estimate, but that might not be precise enough. Alternatively, I can use the formula for the future value of an annuity and solve for PMT.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the present value formula instead, but no, the future value formula is correct here because we're dealing with future value.

So, putting it all together:

PMT = 20,000 / [ ( (1.05^17) - 1 ) / 0.05 ]

Let me calculate (1.05^17) first. Let me break it down:

1.05^1 = 1.05
1.05^2 = 1.1025
1.05^3 ≈ 1.1576
1.05^4 ≈ 1.2155
1.05^5 ≈ 1.2763
1.05^6 ≈ 1.3401
1.05^7 ≈ 1.4071
1.05^8 ≈ 1.4775
1.05^9 ≈ 1.5513
1.05^10 ≈ 1.6289
1.05^11 ≈ 1.7103
1.05^12 ≈ 1.7959
1.05^13 ≈ 1.8856
1.05^14 ≈ 1.9799
1.05^15 ≈ 2.0789
1.05^16 ≈ 2.1820
1.05^17 ≈ 2.2881

So, (1.05)^17 ≈ 2.2881.

Now, subtract 1: 2.2881 - 1 = 1.2881.

Divide by r (0.05): 1.2881 / 0.05 = 25.762.

So, PMT = 20,000 / 25.762 ≈ 775.98.

Looking at the options, B is $773.98, which is very close. I think that's the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in the exponentials. Let me recount:

1.05^1 = 1.05
2: 1.1025
3: 1.1576
4: 1.2155
5: 1.2763
6: 1.3401
7: 1.4071
8: 1.4775
9: 1.5513
10: 1.6289
11: 1.7103
12: 1.7959
13: 1.8856
14: 1.9799
15: 2.0789
16: 2.1820
17: 2.2881. Yes, that seems right.

So the denominator is 25.762, and 20,000 divided by that is approximately 775.98. So the closest option is B: $773.98. Maybe the exact calculation would give a slightly lower number due to more precise exponentials, hence option B.

The correct answer is determined by calculating the annual payment needed for a future value of $20,000 with an annual interest rate of 5% over 17 years using the future value of an ordinary annuity formula. The calculation shows that the required annual deposit is approximately $773.98.

Answer: B
