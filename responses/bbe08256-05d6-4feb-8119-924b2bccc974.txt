Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these options would cause the money supply to increase. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: An increase in the fraction of deposits that must be held by banks. Wait, that sounds like it's related to reserve requirements. If banks have to hold a higher fraction of deposits as reserves, that would reduce the amount they can lend out. Lower lending means less money creation through the fractional reserve system, so the money supply would decrease. So A probably isn't the right answer.

Option B: The purchase of bonds by private individuals. When people buy bonds, they're giving their money to the bond issuer, usually the government. This would take money out of circulation and into savings or government use. So the money supply might not increase; in fact, it could decrease. So B doesn't seem right.

Option C: An increase in the amount of physical cash in circulation. That makes sense because more cash would mean more money in the economy. Cash is part of the money supply, so if more is in circulation, the money supply goes up. So C could be the answer.

Option D: A decrease in the amount of money people are saving. If people save less, they spend more. More spending could lead to increased economic activity, but does it directly increase the money supply? Savings are part of the money in the economy, so if people save less, maybe that money is used elsewhere, but I'm not sure if this directly increases the overall money supply. It might affect velocity, but not necessarily the total money supply. So D might not be the right choice.

Option E: The Federal Reserve raising interest rates. Higher interest rates typically encourage saving and reduce borrowing. When borrowing decreases, banks might have less to lend, which could reduce the money supply. Or, because higher rates attract more foreign capital, it might increase reserves, but I'm not sure. It's a bit tricky, but I think raising rates usually doesn't increase the money supply; it might even decrease it because of reduced lending. So E probably isn't the answer.

Option F: The selling of bonds by the Federal Reserve. The Fed selling bonds would mean they're taking money out of the economy. They sell bonds to reduce the money supply because when they sell, they receive money from buyers, which reduces the overall money in circulation. So F would decrease the money supply, not increase it. So F is not the answer.

Option G: An increase in the discount rate. The discount rate is the rate the Fed charges banks for loans. If it increases, banks might borrow less from the Fed. This could reduce their lending capacity because they have less money to lend, which would decrease the money supply. So G would decrease the money supply, not increase it. So G isn't the right answer.

Option H: The government increasing taxes. Higher taxes mean people have less disposable income. They might save or spend less, which could reduce the money supply. Alternatively, the government might spend the tax money, which could increase it, but it depends. Overall, it's not clear if this would increase the money supply. It might not be the best choice.

Option I: A decrease in the required reserve ratio. The reserve ratio is the fraction of deposits banks must hold as reserves. If this decreases, banks can lend out more of their deposits. When banks lend more, it increases the money supply through the fractional reserve banking system. So I think this would increase the money supply. So I could be the correct answer.

Option J: A decrease in the rate of inflation. Inflation affects the purchasing power of money, but it doesn't directly increase the money supply. A decrease in inflation might slow down the growth of the money supply, but it doesn't cause an increase. So J isn't the answer.

So looking back, the options that seem to increase the money supply are C and I. Wait, but what about option C? If more physical cash is in circulation, that directly adds to the money supply. So both C and I could be correct. But the question is asking which of the following will cause an increase. Let me think again.

Wait, the money supply includes not just physical cash but also bank deposits and other forms. So option I, decreasing the required reserve ratio, allows banks to create more money through lending, which would increase the overall money supply. Similarly, option C adds more physical cash, which is part of M0 or M1, depending on the measure. So both could be correct, but looking at the options, the question might be expecting one answer.

Wait, the options are A to J, and the correct answers are among them. So which one is more directly responsible for an increase in the money supply? Option I, decreasing the required reserve ratio, is a standard tool used by central banks to increase the money supply because it allows more lending. Option C is also correct because more cash in circulation directly adds to the money supply. So both C and I seem correct, but perhaps the question expects one answer. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the question is which of the following will increase the money supply. So both I and C would, but maybe only one is an option. Let me see the options again.

Looking back, the options are:

I: A decrease in the required reserve ratio.

C: An increase in the amount of physical cash in circulation.

So both I and C are correct. But in the given options, perhaps only one is correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Let me think about the options again.

If the government increases the physical cash, that's a direct increase in the money supply. So option C is correct. Similarly, decreasing the required reserve ratio (option I) also increases the money supply because banks can lend more. So both I and C are correct. But in the given options, perhaps only one is correct. Wait, the question is asking for the result of which action. So both I and C would cause an increase, but perhaps in the context of the options given, both are possible. But looking at the options, perhaps the intended answer is I. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is I because it's a monetary policy tool used by the Fed to increase the money supply, while option C is more of a fiscal action or government action. Alternatively, perhaps the question lists only one correct answer, so I need to pick the best option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is I. Because when the required reserve ratio decreases, banks can create more money, which leads to a larger money supply. Similarly, if the Fed buys bonds, that increases the money supply, but that's not one of the options. Wait, option B is private individuals buying bonds, which would decrease the money supply. So perhaps the correct answer is I, a decrease in the required reserve ratio, which allows more lending and thus more money creation.

Alternatively, option C is also correct because more cash in circulation directly increases the money supply. So I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the components of the money supply. M1 includes physical currency and checking deposits. If physical cash increases, M1 increases. Similarly, if the reserve ratio decreases, banks can lend more, increasing deposits, which also increases M1.

So both I and C would increase the money supply. But looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are A to J, and in the given list, both C and I are present. So the correct answers would be both, but the question is a multiple-choice with a single answer. So perhaps the intended answer is I.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I. Let me think about how each option affects the money supply.

Option I: Decrease in required reserve ratio (RR). The money multiplier is 1/(RR). So a lower RR increases the multiplier, leading to a larger money supply.

Option C: More physical cash. That directly adds to the money supply, particularly M0 or M1.

So both are correct, but perhaps the question expects I as the answer because it's a standard monetary policy tool. Alternatively, perhaps the question lists only one correct answer, so I'll go with I.

The money supply will increase as a result of a decrease in the required reserve ratio because it allows banks to lend more, thereby expanding the money supply through the fractional reserve banking system. 

Answer: I
