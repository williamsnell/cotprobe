Okay, so I've got this accounting question here about Verity Co.'s cash flows. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that Verity bought $200,000 of Otra Co. bonds at par and $50,000 of U.S. Treasury bills. They classified the Otra bonds as available-for-sale securities and the Treasuries as cash equivalents.

Wait, I remember that in the statement of cash flows, different types of investments are treated differently. So, for investing activities, when a company buys securities, it's considered an investing activity, right? But wait, cash equivalents are usually short-term, highly liquid investments that are considered part of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. So, when Verity bought the T-bills, those are cash equivalents, which would be reported in the operating activities section, not investing, because they're considered part of cash.

But the Otra bonds are available-for-sale, which are classified as investments. So when Verity buys them, that's an investing activity. But wait, in the statement of cash flows, purchases of investments are reported as cash outflows under investing activities. However, the specifics might depend on how they're presented.

Wait, but the question is about the net cash used in investing activities. Let me think. The Otra bonds are a long-term investment, so the purchase of $200,000 would be a cash outflow in investing activities. The T-bills are cash equivalents, so their purchase would be in the operating section, maybe as part of cash and cash equivalents. But wait, the statement of cash flows categorizes activities into operating, investing, and financing. So the Otra bonds are investing, T-bills are operating.

But the question is about net cash used in investing activities. So Verity spent $200,000 on the bonds, which would be a use of cash in investing. But wait, wait, when a company buys a security, it's an outflow, so it's a use of cash. So the investing section would show a net cash used of $200,000. But wait, the T-bills are cash equivalents; their purchase doesn't affect the investing activities. So the only cash used in investing is the $200k.

Wait, but the options include $200,000 as D. But let me make sure. Let me recall: the statement of cash flows. Investing activities include the cash flows related to the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments. So purchasing Otra bonds is an investing activity, and purchasing T-bills is an operating activity because they are cash equivalents.

Therefore, in the investing section, the cash outflow is $200,000. So the net cash used in investing activities is $200,000. Looking at the options, D is $200,000.

The purchase of Otra Co. bonds as available-for-sale securities is an investing activity, resulting in a $200,000 cash outflow. The U.S. Treasury bills, being cash equivalents, are reported in operating activities. Thus, the net cash used in investing activities is $200,000.
