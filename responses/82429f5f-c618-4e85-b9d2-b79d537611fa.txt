Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about semiconductors. The question is asking which of the options is an n-type semiconductor. I'm a bit rusty on my solid-state physics, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that semiconductors are materials that have conductivity between conductors and insulators. They can be pure elements like silicon or germanium, or they can be doped with other elements to change their properties. Doping is when you add a small amount of impurity to the semiconductor material, which affects its electrical characteristics.

Now, the two main types of doping are n-type and p-type. I think n-type semiconductors are created by adding electrons. To do that, you introduce a donor impurity atom into the semiconductor. Donor atoms have more valence electrons than the semiconductor material. For example, in silicon, which has four valence electrons, a donor atom like phosphorus (which has five valence electrons) would donate an electron to the silicon lattice. This extra electron makes the material n-type because it has a negative charge.

Looking at the options:

A: Silicon – Pure silicon is an intrinsic semiconductor, not n-type.

B: Boron-doped silicon – Boron has three valence electrons. When it's doped into silicon, it acts as an acceptor, creating holes. So this would make it p-type, not n-type.

C: Pure germanium – Like pure silicon, germanium is an intrinsic semiconductor. So it's not n-type unless doped.

D: Arsenic-doped silicon – Arsenic is in group VA of the periodic table. It has five valence electrons. When doped into silicon, which has four valence electrons, arsenic donates an electron. So this should make the silicon n-type.

E: Indium Phosphide – Indium is in group IIIA, so it has three valence electrons. Phosphorus is in group VA, which has five. So indium would act as a donor (n-type) if it's the impurity. Wait, but in indium phosphide (InP), both are group III and VA elements. I think InP is a compound semiconductor, but I'm not sure if it's n-type or p-type. Wait, no, In is group III (3 electrons), P is group VA (5). When In is the majority, I think InP is n-type because In donates electrons. But wait, I'm not certain. I'll keep this in mind and check the other options.

F: Zinc-doped silicon – Zinc has four valence electrons, same as silicon. So it might not donate or accept electrons. But I think zinc is a metal, and perhaps it's a metal impurity. Wait, no, I think zinc is a group IIB element. Oh, wait, I'm getting confused. Actually, zinc is a metal with a filled d-subshell, so when it's doped into silicon, it might not contribute much. Alternatively, I think zinc is a donor, but maybe in this case, it's more of an acceptor? Or perhaps it's a neutral impurity. I'm not sure, so I'll skip this for now.

G: Pure silicon – Same as option A, it's intrinsic, not n-type.

H: Gallium arsenide – Gallium is group IIIA (3 electrons), arsenic is group VA (5). In gallium arsenide (GaAs), the majority is gallium, which has three electrons. So when gallium is the main component, it would be the donor, making it n-type. Wait, but no, in GaAs, arsenic is the acceptor. Gallium has three electrons, arsenic has five. So GaAs is a compound semiconductor, and it's p-type because arsenic is the acceptor. Wait, no, that's not right. Actually, in GaAs, the structure is such that arsenic donates an electron. Or wait, no—gallium has three valence electrons, arsenic has five. So when you have GaAs, the gallium contributes a +3 charge, and arsenic contributes -5. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. I think GaAs is actually n-type because the arsenic donates an electron, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, I might be mixing it up with something else. Maybe GaAs is p-type. I'm getting a bit stuck here, so I'll come back to it.

I: Silicon carbide – Silicon has four valence electrons, carbon has four. So SiC is a covalent semiconductor. But is it n-type or p-type? I think SiC can be either, depending on the doping. Pure SiC is intrinsic, so it's not n-type unless doped. So this option is pure SiC, which isn't n-type.

J: Diamond – Diamond is a pure carbon structure, similar to silicon in that it's a covalent crystal. But pure diamond isn't a semiconductor; it's more of an insulator. So this isn't n-type.

So, going back, the options that could be n-type are D, E, H.

Option D: Arsenic-doped silicon. Arsenic has five valence electrons. When doped into silicon, which has four, arsenic donates an electron, making it n-type. So D is a candidate.

Option E: Indium Phosphide (InP). Indium is group IIIA (3 electrons), phosphorus is group VA (5). In InP, the indium is the majority, so it donates three electrons? Wait, no, each indium atom contributes three valence electrons. But wait, in the compound semiconductor, each atom is part of the crystal lattice. Indium has a +3 charge, phosphorus has -5. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. I think in compound semiconductors, the overall charge must balance. So InP is a compound where each In atom is +3, and each P atom is -5. To balance, the ratio is 1:1, so each InP unit is neutral. But in terms of doping, indium would act as a donor because it has more electrons than the four in silicon? Wait, no, InP is a compound semiconductor, not doped with another element. So InP itself is a semiconductor. Since indium has three valence electrons, when it's part of the crystal, it donates electrons, making InP an n-type semiconductor. So E could be an option.

Option H: Gallium arsenide (GaAs). Gallium is group IIIA (3 electrons), arsenic is group VA (5). So in GaAs, each Ga atom contributes +3, and each As contributes -5. So GaAs is a compound semiconductor. Since arsenic has more electrons than gallium, I think GaAs is a p-type semiconductor because arsenic acts as an acceptor, creating holes. Wait, no, I think I got it backwards. Gallium has three electrons, arsenic has five. So when Ga is combined with As, each As can accept an electron from Ga, creating a hole. So GaAs is p-type. Therefore, H is p-type, not n-type.

So the possible n-type options are D and E.

Wait, but the question is which of the following is an n-type semiconductor. So let's look at all the options again.

Option D: Arsenic-doped silicon. As is a donor, so yes, n-type.

Option E: Indium Phosphide. Indium is a donor, so InP is n-type.

But wait, the question is about which is an n-type semiconductor. So both D and E could be correct, but looking at the options, the correct answer is either D or E.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify:

In silicon, when you add a donor impurity like arsenic (group VA), which has five valence electrons, it donates an electron to the silicon lattice, creating free electrons. So arsenic-doped silicon is n-type. So D is correct.

Indium Phosphide (InP) is a compound semiconductor. Indium is group IIIA, so it has three valence electrons. When InP forms, each In atom donates three electrons, making it n-type. So E is also an n-type semiconductor.

Wait, but the options are multiple; the question is which is an n-type. So both D and E are correct? But the options are A to J, and the answer expects one letter.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

E: Indium Phosphide

H: Gallium arsenide

So, I think both D and E could be correct, but looking at the options, perhaps the question expects only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the groups. Let me think again.

Group IIIA elements (like In) have three valence electrons. When they are doped into a semiconductor, they act as donors, making it n-type.

Group VA elements (like As and P) have five valence electrons. When they are doped into a semiconductor, they can act as acceptors (if the semiconductor is group IV, like silicon or germanium). Wait, no, group VA elements have five valence electrons. Silicon has four. So when a VA element is doped into silicon, it has five electrons, so it can accept an electron from silicon, creating a hole. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think: in group IV semiconductors, a group VA atom (like As) has five valence electrons. When it's incorporated into the silicon lattice, it has four bonds, leaving one extra electron. So that extra electron becomes a free electron, making it n-type. Wait, that's conflicting with what I thought earlier.

Wait, so when a group VA atom is doped into a group IV semiconductor, it has five valence electrons. In the lattice, it forms four bonds, leaving one electron free. So that would make it n-type. So arsenic-doped silicon (option D) is n-type.

Similarly, indium (group IIIA) has three valence electrons. When doped into silicon, it donates one electron, making it n-type. So option E, Indium Phosphide, is a compound semiconductor where In is group IIIA, so it donates electrons, making it n-type.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because in the case of group VA in silicon, the behavior might be different. Let me clarify:

Group IV elements (like Si and Ge) have four valence electrons. 

- If you add a group IIIA element (like B or In), which has three valence electrons, it acts as a donor, providing an electron. So this makes the semiconductor p-type? No, wait, no. Wait, when you add a group IIIA impurity to Si, each such atom donates a hole? Or an electron?

Wait, no. Let me think of it this way: in a semiconductor, each atom contributes a certain number of valence electrons. For example, in pure silicon, each Si atom has four valence electrons, and they form covalent bonds.

When you add a donor impurity, like phosphorus (group VA), which has five valence electrons. In the silicon lattice, each P atom will form four bonds, leaving one extra electron. This extra electron is a free electron, which is a negative charge carrier. So phosphorus-doped silicon is n-type.

Similarly, adding a group IIIA element like boron (B) to silicon would have three valence electrons. Each B atom would form three bonds, leaving a hole where the fourth bond would be. So this would create a positive charge carrier, making it p-type.

Wait, but indium is group IIIA, so when doped into silicon, it would act as a donor, creating holes. So In-doped silicon would be p-type, not n-type. But option E is Indium Phosphide (InP), which is a compound semiconductor. In InP, In is group IIIA, so it donates an electron, making it n-type.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to summarize:

- n-type semiconductors are created by adding donor impurities, which have one more valence electron than the semiconductor. For group IV semiconductors (like Si), a donor impurity is group VA (like P, As), which have five valence electrons. When they donate an electron, the semiconductor becomes n-type.

- p-type semiconductors are created by adding acceptor impurities, which have one less valence electron than the semiconductor. For group IV, acceptors are group IIIA (like B, In), which have three valence electrons. These acceptors create holes, making the semiconductor p-type.

So, looking back:

Option D: Arsenic-doped silicon. Arsenic is group VA, so it's a donor, making it n-type. So D is n-type.

Option E: Indium Phosphide (InP). In is group IIIA, so in InP, In is the donor, making it n-type. So E is also n-type.

But wait, the question is which of the options is an n-type. So both D and E could be n-type. But looking at the options, perhaps the intended answer is D, as it's more straightforward.

Wait, but in the options, E is Indium Phosphide, which is a compound semiconductor. So in InP, In is group IIIA, so it's a donor, making it n-type.

So both D and E are n-type. But the options are from A to J, and I need to pick one. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: Silicon – pure, not n-type.

B: Boron-doped silicon – p-type.

C: Pure germanium – intrinsic.

D: Arsenic-doped silicon – n-type.

E: Indium Phosphide – n-type.

F: Zinc-doped silicon – I'm not sure. Zinc is group IIB, which has two valence electrons. But I think in this case, zinc is a metal and when doped into silicon, it might cause more issues, but perhaps it's an acceptor? Or maybe it's a neutral impurity. I'm not certain, but I think it's more likely to be an acceptor, making it p-type, but I'm not sure.

G: Pure silicon – intrinsic.

H: Gallium arsenide – p-type, as arsenic is group VA and would act as an acceptor.

I: Silicon carbide – intrinsic.

J: Diamond – intrinsic, but a poor semiconductor.

So, both D and E are n-type. But looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct. Wait, the question is which is an n-type, so multiple could be correct, but the options are given as single letters. Maybe the intended answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

In group IV semiconductors, group VA elements (like As) are donors, making them n-type. So D is correct.

In compound semiconductors like InP, In is group IIIA, so it's a donor, making InP n-type. So E is also correct.

But the options are given as separate choices, so perhaps the question expects both D and E to be correct, but since it's a multiple-choice with single answer, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is D: Arsenic-doped silicon.

Alternatively, maybe E is correct because InP is a compound semiconductor that's n-type.

Wait, but the question is which of the following is an n-type semiconductor. So both D and E are correct. But the options are given as single letters, so perhaps the intended answer is D.

Wait, but the options are:

E: Indium Phosphide

H: Gallium arsenide

So perhaps I should check the properties of these.

Indium Phosphide (InP) is a compound semiconductor, and it's known to be n-type. Gallium arsenide (GaAs) is p-type because arsenic is the acceptor.

So, in the options, both D and E are n-type.

But the question lists E as Indium Phosphide, which is n-type.

Wait, but the options are given as separate letters, so the answer could be either D or E.

Wait, but the user's options are:

A through J.

The question is which is an n-type semiconductor. So both D and E are correct. But perhaps the intended answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D.

Wait, but in the initial analysis, I thought that group VA in silicon would be a donor, making it n-type. So D is correct.

So the answer should be D.
</think>

To determine which of the given options is an n-type semiconductor, we analyze the properties of each material:

1. **n-type semiconductors** are created by doping a semiconductor material with a donor impurity that contributes an extra electron, typically elements from group VA (e.g., arsenic, phosphorus) when doped into group IV semiconductors like silicon.

2. **p-type semiconductors**, on the other hand, are created by doping with acceptor impurities that create holes, typically elements from group IIIA (e.g., boron, indium) when doped into group IV semiconductors.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A: Silicon** – Pure silicon is an intrinsic semiconductor, not n-type.
- **B: Boron-doped silicon** – Boron is a group IIIA element and acts as an acceptor, making it p-type.
- **C: Pure germanium** – Pure germanium is an intrinsic semiconductor, not n-type.
- **D: Arsenic-doped silicon** – Arsenic is a group VA element and acts as a donor, contributing an extra electron to the silicon lattice, making it n-type.
- **E: Indium Phosphide (InP)** – Indium is a group IIIA element, but in the compound semiconductor InP, it donates electrons, making it n-type.
- **F: Zinc-doped silicon** – Zinc is a group IIB element and does not typically act as a donor or acceptor in silicon, so it is not n-type.
- **G: Pure silicon** – Pure silicon is intrinsic, not n-type.
- **H: Gallium arsenide (GaAs)** – Gallium is group IIIA, and arsenic is group VA. In GaAs, arsenic acts as an acceptor, making it p-type.
- **I: Silicon carbide** – Pure silicon carbide is intrinsic, not n-type.
- **J: Diamond** – Diamond is a pure carbon structure and an insulator, not a semiconductor.

### Conclusion:
Both **D (Arsenic-doped silicon)** and **E (Indium Phosphide)** are n-type semiconductors. However, the question likely expects a single answer, and **D** is the more straightforward choice as it directly involves doping silicon with a donor impurity.
