Question:

A buyer purchased a gallon of nonfat milk from a market. The milk, which was sold in a plastic container, had been processed and packaged by a dairy. That evening, the buyer was preparing dinner and poured himself a glass of milk from the container purchased at the market. He then sat down to eat his meal and proceeded to take a mouthful of milk. As he did so, the buyer felt something furry lodge in his mouth. He immediately spat out the furry object and saw that it was a dead mouse. The buyer suffered severe emotional distress but did not suffer any physical illness or injury. If the buyer asserts a claim against the dairy based on negligent manufacturing, he will most likely

Options:

A: not recover, because the dairy's negligence only caused mental disturbance.
B: recover, under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.
C: not recover, because the dairy cannot be proven to have been the source of the mouse.
D: recover, under the theory of strict liability.
E: recover, because he suffered severe emotional distress.
F: recover, because the dairy breached its duty of care by failing to properly package the milk.
G: not recover, because the buyer's proper cause of action is for intentional infliction of mental distress.
H: recover, because the dairy failed in its duty of care.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about a buyer who found a dead mouse in their milk. The question is about whether the buyer can recover damages from the dairy under the theory of negligent manufacturing. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: The buyer bought a gallon of nonfat milk in a plastic container from a market. The dairy processed and packaged it. Later that evening, when the buyer poured milk, he found a dead mouse in it. He didn't get physically injured but suffered severe emotional distress.

The question is about asserting a claim against the dairy based on negligent manufacturing. So, I need to think about the elements of negligence and whether they apply here.

Negligence requires four main elements: duty, breach, causation, and harm. Let's go through each.

1. **Duty**: The dairy has a duty to ensure that the milk they sell is safe and free from contaminants. Packaging should be sealed properly to prevent such foreign objects from getting into the product. So, the dairy definitely had a duty here.

2. **Breach**: Did the dairy breach that duty? If the milk had a dead mouse, it suggests that the packaging wasn't done properly. Maybe the container wasn't sealed correctly, allowing the mouse to get in. Alternatively, maybe during processing, the mouse got into the milk. Either way, if the dairy's standard of care wasn't met, that's a breach. So, there's likely a breach here.

3. **Causation**: Did the dairy's breach cause the buyer's harm? Yes, because the mouse was in the milk that the dairy sold. The buyer's emotional distress directly resulted from the dairy's failure to properly package or process the milk.

4. **Harm**: The buyer suffered severe emotional distress. Now, in tort law, emotional distress alone might not always be enough unless it's accompanied by physical harm. But there's a concept called "negligent infliction of emotional distress," which sometimes allows recovery for emotional harm without physical injury, especially in cases where the distress is severe and foreseeable.

Wait, but the question is specifically about negligent manufacturing. So, this is a product liability issue. Under negligence, the plaintiff needs to show that the defendant's negligence directly caused their injury. Here, the dairy's negligence in manufacturing (packaging) led to the mouse in the milk, which caused emotional distress.

Looking at the options:

A: Not recover because only mental disturbance. But in some cases, emotional distress can be compensable if it's severe and foreseeable. So this might not be the correct answer.

B: Recover under res ipsa loquitur. Res ipsa loquitur means "the thing speaks for itself," implying negligence without direct proof. If the event is so obviously due to negligence that it can be inferred, then maybe. But I'm not sure if this applies here. The presence of a mouse might indicate negligence, but perhaps it's more about strict liability.

C: Not recover because can't prove the dairy was the source. But the milk came directly from the dairy, so the buyer can probably prove it was their product. So C might not be correct.

D: Recover under strict liability. Strict liability is more about the product being unreasonably dangerous regardless of negligence. Under strict liability, the dairy could be liable if the product was defective. But the question is about negligent manufacturing, not strict liability. So D might not be the best answer, unless the options mention both.

E: Recover because of emotional distress. Some jurisdictions allow recovery for emotional distress without physical injury in certain cases, like if it's foreseeable and severe. But again, the question is about negligence, not IIED (intentional infliction), so E could be a possibility.

F: Recover because dairy breached duty by failing to package properly. This seems to directly address negligence—duty, breach, and causation. The breach was failing to package, leading to the mouse. But what about the harm? The harm was emotional distress. So F says "recover" but doesn't directly address whether emotional distress is sufficient.

G: Not recover because proper cause is intentional infliction. But the dairy didn't intend to cause distress; this is negligence, not intentional. So G is probably incorrect.

H: Recover because dairy failed in duty of care. This seems to cover duty and breach, but again, the issue is whether emotional distress is enough. H says "recover," but we need to see if the law allows that.

Now, considering the elements, the buyer has a duty, breach, and causation. The harm is emotional distress. In some jurisdictions, emotional distress can be a compensable injury in negligence if it's severe and if it's a foreseeable result of the defendant's negligence.

So looking at the options, F says "recover, because the dairy breached its duty of care by failing to properly package the milk." That directly addresses the breach, but it doesn't mention the harm. However, since the question is about whether the buyer can assert a claim, the main issue is whether the elements are met, including the harm.

Alternatively, E says "recover because he suffered severe emotional distress." But the key is whether the dairy's negligence caused that distress, which it did.

Wait, the question is about negligent manufacturing, so it's a product liability case under negligence, not strict liability. So in this case, the buyer would have to show that the dairy was negligent in their manufacturing process, which led to the contamination.

In product liability, under negligence, the plaintiff must show that the defendant failed to exercise reasonable care in the manufacturing process. If the mouse was due to improper packaging or processing, that's a breach.

As for the emotional distress, in some jurisdictions, emotional distress alone is not enough unless it's accompanied by physical injury or it's so severe that it's considered a compensable harm. But in this case, the buyer didn't have physical harm, just emotional distress.

So, looking at the options, option F says the dairy breached its duty, which is correct, but it doesn't mention the emotional distress. However, the question is whether the buyer can assert a claim, so the fact that there's emotional distress (harm) is necessary.

Wait, but option E says "recover because he suffered severe emotional distress." However, in negligence, the emotional distress must be a foreseeable result of the defendant's actions and must be compensable.

In some cases, courts have allowed recovery for emotional distress without physical injury, especially in food contamination cases where the distress is severe. For example, if someone eats something contaminated and gets very sick, even if not physically injured, emotional distress can be compensable.

So, perhaps E is correct because the emotional distress is severe. But then, the issue is whether the dairy is liable for that. The dairy's negligence caused the distress, so E could be a reason to recover.

But looking back, the question is about negligent manufacturing, so the focus is on the dairy's negligence, not strict liability. So, in that case, if the dairy's negligence led to the mouse, and the buyer's distress was a foreseeable result, then the dairy is liable.

So, the buyer can recover because the dairy breached its duty, and the emotional distress is the harm. So, looking at the options, F says the dairy breached its duty, but it doesn't mention the emotional distress as the harm. Option E focuses on the emotional distress, but it's because of the negligence.

Alternatively, option H says "recover because the dairy failed in its duty of care." That's a bit vague but suggests that all elements are met.

Wait, but the correct answer is likely F or E. Let me think again.

The buyer's claim is based on negligent manufacturing. The elements would be duty, breach, causation, and harm. The dairy had a duty, breached it by failing to package properly, which caused the mouse, leading to emotional distress as harm.

So, under negligence, the buyer can recover if the emotional distress is considered harm. So, in that case, the correct answer would be F, which states that the dairy breached its duty of care by failing to package properly, leading to recovery.

But wait, F doesn't mention the emotional distress. It only states the breach. So perhaps the correct answer is H, which says "recover because the dairy failed in its duty of care." But H is too broad and doesn't specify the reason.

Alternatively, E says "recover because he suffered severe emotional distress." But in negligence, the emotional distress must be a result of the defendant's negligence. So, if the question is about whether the buyer can assert a claim, the answer would be yes, because the dairy's negligence caused the distress, which is a compensable harm.

Wait, but in some jurisdictions, emotional distress isn't enough unless it's physical. But in others, it is. Since the question doesn't specify jurisdiction, I think the better answer is that the buyer can recover because the dairy's negligence caused the emotional distress, which is a foreseeable harm.

So, looking at the options, F says the dairy breached its duty, which is correct, but it doesn't address the emotional distress. Option E focuses on the emotional distress, but it's because of the dairy's negligence.

Alternatively, option H says "recover because the dairy failed in its duty of care." That's a bit vague, but it's more about the breach and duty, not the harm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F, because it directly addresses the breach of duty, which is a key element. The emotional distress is the harm, so the breach and causation and duty are met.

But the question is about whether the buyer will "most likely" recover. In product liability, if the plaintiff can show negligence in manufacturing, and the harm was foreseeable, then yes.

So, perhaps the answer is F or H.

Wait, another angle: In strict liability, the manufacturer can be held liable without proving negligence, but the question is about negligent manufacturing, so it's a negligence claim.

In negligence, for the buyer to recover, they must prove all four elements. They have duty, breach, causation, and harm (emotional distress). If the jurisdiction allows emotional distress as harm, then they can recover.

So, looking at the options, which ones align?

Option E says "recover because he suffered severe emotional distress." But that's only part of the equation; the dairy must have been negligent.

Option F says "recover because the dairy breached its duty of care by failing to properly package the milk." That's correct about the breach, but it doesn't mention the emotional distress as the harm.

So, perhaps the best answer is F because it correctly identifies the breach, and the emotional distress is the harm, which the question allows.

Alternatively, the correct answer might be E, but I'm not sure. Some states allow emotional distress as a standalone harm.

Wait, in the Restatement (Second) of Torts, §436, a person may recover for negligent infliction of emotional distress if they are in a zone of danger, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, if the distress is severe and foreseeable, like in a case of product contamination, some courts allow recovery.

So, putting it all together, the buyer can recover because the dairy's negligence caused the emotional distress, which is a foreseeable harm. So, the correct answer would be F or E.

But looking at the options, F is about breach of duty, and E is about emotional distress. The question asks about the basis for the claim, so the correct reasoning would be that the dairy breached its duty, causing the distress.

So, perhaps the answer is F.

Wait, but the question is about whether the buyer will "most likely" recover. In many jurisdictions, emotional distress without physical injury is not recoverable in negligence. However, in strict liability, it might be different.

Wait, no, the question is about negligent manufacturing, not strict liability. So, in strict liability, the dairy could be liable under a different theory (like defective product), but the question is about negligence.

So, if the jurisdiction doesn't allow emotional distress without physical injury, then the buyer can't recover. But if it does, then yes.

But the question says the buyer "asserts a claim against the dairy based on negligent manufacturing." So, under negligence, the buyer must prove that the dairy's negligence caused the emotional distress, which is a foreseeable harm.

In some jurisdictions, emotional distress is allowed, so the buyer can recover. Therefore, the correct answer would be E or F.

Wait, but the options are:

E: Recover because he suffered severe emotional distress.

F: Recover because the dairy breached its duty of care by failing to properly package the milk.

So, F is about breach, E is about the harm. But the correct reasoning is that the dairy's breach caused the emotional distress, so the buyer can recover because of the breach leading to harm.

But the options are separate. So, the correct answer would be F because it's about the breach, which is part of the negligence claim. But I'm a bit confused because the emotional distress is the harm.

Alternatively, the correct answer is E because the emotional distress is the reason for recovery.

Wait, perhaps the best way is to think about what each option says.

Option F says "recover, because the dairy breached its duty of care by failing to properly package the milk." This directly addresses the breach of duty, which is a necessary element. However, the question is whether the buyer can recover, which depends on all elements, including harm.

Option E says "recover because he suffered severe emotional distress." But that alone isn't enough unless the other elements are met.

So, the correct answer is F because it's about the breach, which is a key part of the negligence claim, and the emotional distress is the harm. But the options don't combine them, so perhaps the best fit is F.

Wait, but the question is about whether the buyer can recover, so the cause of action is based on the breach leading to the harm. So, the correct answer would be F because it's the breach, but the harm is also necessary.

Wait, but looking at the options again, perhaps the correct answer is E because the emotional distress is the basis for recovery, but that's not exactly accurate because the breach is the cause.

Alternatively, the correct answer is H: "recover because the dairy failed in its duty of care." That's a bit vague but includes the breach and perhaps the duty.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible correct reasoning.

In a negligence claim, the plaintiff must show that the defendant owed a duty, breached it, causing the plaintiff's injury, which was foreseeable.

Here, the dairy owed a duty to produce safe milk. They breached that duty by having a mouse in the milk, likely due to improper packaging. The breach caused the buyer's emotional distress, which is a foreseeable result of finding a mouse in the milk.

Therefore, the buyer can recover because the dairy's breach of duty caused the emotional distress. So, the correct answer would be F, which states that the dairy breached its duty by failing to package properly.

Wait, but F doesn't mention the emotional distress. It just says they breached their duty. But the harm is necessary. So, perhaps the correct answer is E because it's the harm that allows recovery.

Alternatively, the correct answer is H: "recover because the dairy failed in its duty of care." That's about the breach, but it doesn't mention the harm. It's a bit unclear.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E because the emotional distress is the harm that allows recovery, assuming the jurisdiction allows it. So, the buyer can recover because he suffered severe emotional distress, which was caused by the dairy's negligence.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach is to think about the possible answers.

Option D: Recover under strict liability. But the question is about negligence, not strict liability, so D might not be correct unless the answer combines both.

Option B: Recover under res ipsa loquitur. That's possible because the presence of a mouse in the milk might be so obvious a case of negligence that it can be inferred. But I'm not sure if this is the main issue here.

Option G: Not recover because the proper cause is IIED. But IIED requires intentional conduct, which isn't the case here. So G is incorrect.

So, narrowing it down, the options are between A, C, E, F, H.

Option A says not recover because only mental disturbance. But if the jurisdiction allows emotional distress, then A is wrong.

Option C says can't prove the dairy was the source. But the milk came from them, so C is incorrect.

So, it's between E, F, H.

Now, in the case, the buyer didn't have physical injury, only emotional distress. So, the key is whether emotional distress is a sufficient harm in a negligence claim.

In some jurisdictions, yes, especially if it's severe and foreseeable. So, if the jurisdiction allows that, then E is correct.

But the question is about negligent manufacturing, so the focus is on the negligence in manufacturing.

So, the correct answer is likely F, which focuses on the breach of duty by failing to package properly.

Wait, but the question is whether the buyer can recover, which depends on all elements. So, if the emotional distress is considered harm, then F is about the breach, but the recovery is because of the harm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E because the emotional distress is the reason for recovery, but it's only allowed if the other elements are met.

I think I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to recall: in negligence, if the plaintiff can show that the defendant's negligence caused emotional distress that's severe and foreseeable, then they can recover. So, the answer would be E.

But wait, the question is about whether the claim is based on negligent manufacturing. So, the focus is on the manufacturing process. The dairy's negligence in manufacturing (packaging) led to the mouse, which caused the distress.

So, the correct answer would be F because it's about the breach of duty in manufacturing. However, the emotional distress is the harm, so perhaps the correct answer is E.

Alternatively, the correct answer is H: "recover because the dairy failed in its duty of care." That seems to cover the breach and duty, but not the harm.

I think the correct answer is F because it directly addresses the breach of duty in manufacturing, which is the main issue. The emotional distress is the harm, but the question is about the basis of the claim, which is the breach.
</think>

The buyer purchased nonfat milk that contained a dead mouse, leading to severe emotional distress. The claim is based on negligent manufacturing. For negligence, the elements are duty, breach, causation, and harm. The dairy owed a duty to provide safe milk, breached this duty by failing to properly package it, and this breach caused the buyer's emotional distress, which is a foreseeable harm. Emotional distress can be compensable in negligence if it is severe and foreseeable, even without physical injury. The correct answer focuses on the breach of duty, which is key to the negligence claim.

Answer: F
