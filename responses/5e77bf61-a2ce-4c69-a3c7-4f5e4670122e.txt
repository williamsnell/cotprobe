Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem about fruit flies. Let me read the question carefully again. The question is about three traits in Drosophila melanogaster: wing length, body color, and eye color. Each trait is controlled by a single pair of contrasting genes with complete dominance. 

The traits are:
- Wing length: Long wings (L) vs. short wings (I)
- Body color: Gray body (B) vs. black body (b)
- Eye color: Dull red eyes (R) vs. brown eyes (r)

Each gene pair is on a different pair of chromosomes, meaning they're independent. So, they assort independently.

The cross is between two flies that are heterozygous for each pair of genes. So each parent has the genotype I L for wings (since they're heterozygous for each trait), B b for body color, and R r for eye color. Wait, wait, no—wait, each trait is heterozygous. So each parent's genotype would be I^L for wings, B^b for body, and R^r for eyes? Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Let me think about it again.

Wait, for each trait, the parents are heterozygous. So for each gene, each parent has one dominant and one recessive allele. So for wings, they would be I L? Wait, no, the alleles are I (short) and L (long), right? So a heterozygous fly would have I and L. So genotype I L. Similarly, for body color, B and b, so Bb. And for eye color, R and r, so Rr.

Wait, but wait, the alleles are probably written as I and L for wing length, but I think it's more common to denote the dominant allele as uppercase and recessive as lowercase. So for wings, the long wing is dominant (L), and short is recessive (I). So a heterozygous fly would be I L, but wait, no—actually, the notation is usually the other way around. Wait, no, wait: the dominant allele is typically represented by a capital letter. So if long wings are dominant, the allele is L, and the recessive is i, perhaps? Wait, but in the question, they've written it as long wings = L and short = I. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the notation wrong.

Wait, the question says: long wings = L, short wings = I. So the alleles are L and I. Similarly, body color: gray (B) and black (b). And eye color: dull red (R) and brown (r). So each trait is heterozygous in the parents. So the parents have genotype L I for wings, B b for body, and R r for eyes. Wait, no, that's not possible because each parent can't have L and I at the same time. Oh, wait, no, because each gene is on a different pair of chromosomes. So each parent is heterozygous for each trait. So for wings, each parent is L I? No, wait, that's not correct because each gene is on a separate pair. So each parent has two alleles for each gene. So for wings, it's L and I? Or maybe it's Li and something else. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Since each gene is on a separate pair of chromosomes, the parents are heterozygous for each gene. So for wing length, each parent has one dominant allele (L) and one recessive (I), so genotype L I. Similarly, for body color, each parent has B and b, so Bb. For eye color, each parent has R and r, so Rr.

So each parent's genotype is L I (wings), Bb (body), and Rr (eyes). But wait, actually, I think that's not correct because each gene is on a separate pair of chromosomes, so each parent is heterozygous for each of the three traits. So each parent's genotype is L i (if L is dominant) for wings, Bb for body, and Rr for eyes. Wait, but in the question, the alleles are given as L and I for wings, B and b for body, and R and r for eyes. So perhaps the parents are L I (but that's not possible because each gene is either L or I, so the genotype would be L I? No, that's not correct because each gene is on a separate chromosome. So each parent has two alleles for each gene. So for wings, each parent is L I, but that's a genotype of L and I, which would mean they can produce either L or I gametes. Similarly, for body color, each parent is B b, and for eyes, R r.

Wait, but wait, each parent is heterozygous for each of the three traits. So each parent's genotype is Li (for wings, since L is dominant and I is recessive), Bb (body), Rr (eyes). So the parents are L i, Bb, Rr.

Now, the question is asking for the probability that the first adult fly emerging is short-winged, gray-bodied, and red-eyed.

Wait, no: the desired phenotype is short-winged, gray-bodied, and red-eyed.

Wait, let's clarify each trait's phenotype based on the alleles:

- Wing length: Short wing is recessive (I). So to have short wings, the fly must be homozygous recessive, i.e., II. But wait, the parents are heterozygous, so their genotype is I L? No, wait, the parents are heterozygous for each gene, so for wings, each parent is L I? No, that can't be because L and I are alleles. So each parent is L I for wings. Wait, I think I'm getting the notation wrong. Let me try to correct this.

Each gene is on a separate pair of chromosomes, so each trait is controlled by one gene with two alleles. The parents are heterozygous for each gene. So for each gene, each parent has one dominant and one recessive allele.

So for wing length, the alleles are L (long) and I (short). Since the parents are heterozygous, their genotype is LI (but that's not possible because each gene has two alleles; perhaps it's L and I, so L I. Wait, but that's not correct because each gene is either L or I. So each parent has one L and one I allele for wing length, making them heterozygous. So genotype is LI. Similarly, for body color, each parent has B and b, so genotype Bb. For eye color, R and r, so Rr.

Now, when two heterozygous flies are crossed, we can find the probability of each trait in the offspring.

But wait, the question is about the first adult fly emerging. I think that refers to the probability of the offspring having the specified phenotype. So we need to find the probability that an offspring has short wings, gray body, and red eyes.

Wait, let me check each trait:

1. Short wings: Since wing length is controlled by the alleles L (long) and I (short), and the parents are heterozygous (L I), the probability that an offspring has short wings (ii) is 25%. Because in a selfing (heterozygote x heterozygote), the possible genotypes are LL, LI, IL, II. But wait, no: when two heterozygotes (L I) are crossed, the Punnett square would be:

   L | I
L | I
I | L

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, each parent can give either L or I. So the possible combinations are:

Parent 1 gametes: L or I
Parent 2 gametes: L or I

So the Punnett square is:

LL (long wings)
LI (long wings)
IL (long wings)
II (short wings)

Wait, but in reality, it's more accurate to note that each allele is independent, so the possible offspring for each trait are:

- For wings: probability of II (short) is 25% (1/4), and LI (long) is 75% (3/4). Wait, no, because each parent contributes either L or I. So the possible combinations are:

LL (25%): long wings
LI (50%): long wings (because LI is heterozygous, which shows the dominant trait)
IL (same as LI, so also 50%)
II (25%): short wings.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, when you cross two heterozygotes (L I x L I), the possible offspring are:

- 25% LL (homozygous dominant, long wings)
- 50% L I (heterozygous, long wings)
- 25% II (homozygous recessive, short wings)

Wait, but wait, that's not correct because each parent can only contribute one allele. So for the wings, the possible offspring for each trait are:

Each parent can give L or I.

So possible combinations:

L from parent1 and L from parent2 → LL (long)
L from parent1 and I from parent2 → LI (long)
I from parent1 and L from parent2 → IL (long)
I from parent1 and I from parent2 → II (short)

So the probabilities are:

Probability of LL: 25%
Probability of LI: 50%
Probability of II: 25%

But since both LI and IL are the same as heterozygous, the phenotype is long wings in those cases. So the probability of an offspring having short wings (II) is 25% (1/4).

Similarly, for body color: each parent is Bb (heterozygous, since B is dominant and b is recessive). So when crossed, the possible offspring are:

BB (25%): gray body
Bb (50%): gray body
bb (25%): black body.

So the probability of a gray body (BB or Bb) is 75% (3/4).

Wait, no, wait: the question asks for gray body, which is the dominant trait. So the probability of having a gray body is the probability of having at least one B allele. So BB, Bb, or Bb. So that's 3/4.

Wait, no, the parents are Bb x Bb, so the possible offspring are:

BB (25%)
Bb (50%)
bb (25%)

So the probability of being gray (BB or Bb) is 75% (3/4).

For eye color: each parent is Rr (heterozygous, with R being dominant and r recessive). So when crossed, the possible offspring are:

RR (25%): red eyes
Rr (50%): red eyes
rr (25%): brown eyes.

So the probability of having red eyes (RR or Rr) is 75% (3/4).

Now, since the three traits are independent (on different chromosomes), the probabilities multiply.

We want the probability of short wings (1/4), gray body (3/4), and red eyes (3/4).

So the combined probability is (1/4) * (3/4) * (3/4).

Let me calculate that: 1/4 is 0.25, 3/4 is 0.75.

0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875; 0.1875 * 0.75 = 0.140625.

Which is 9/64.

Wait, 9/64 is 0.140625. So that's the probability.

Looking at the options, option C is 9/64. So the answer should be option C.
</think>

The probability of the first adult fly emerging with short wings, gray body, and red eyes is calculated by determining the probability for each trait independently and then multiplying them together due to independent assortment. 

For wings: The probability of short wings (homozygous recessive, II) is \( \frac{1}{4} \).  
For body color: The probability of a gray body (dominant trait, BB or Bb) is \( \frac{3}{4} \).  
For eye color: The probability of red eyes (dominant trait, RR or Rr) is \( \frac{3}{4} \).  

Multiplying these probabilities:  
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{64}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is **C: 9/64**.
