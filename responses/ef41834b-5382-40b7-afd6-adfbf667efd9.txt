Okay, so I need to solve this physics problem about a train picking up water. Let me read the question again carefully.

The train is moving at a constant speed of 60 mph and picks up 15,000 lb of water over 400 yards. We need to find the exact force and horsepower required. The options are A to J, each with a force in pounds and horsepower (hp).

Alright, let's break this down. I think I remember that when a train picks up water, it's about the force needed to accelerate the water to the speed of the train. Since the train is moving at a constant speed, the force should relate to the rate at which momentum is imparted to the water.

First, I should probably convert all the units to consistent ones. Let's see:

The train's speed is 60 mph. I'll convert that to feet per second (fps) because other units like horsepower might be easier to handle in imperial units. 

1 mile is 5280 feet, and 1 hour is 3600 seconds. So, 60 mph is 60 * 5280 / 3600 fps. Let me calculate that: 60 * 5280 = 316,800, divided by 3600 is 88 fps. So the speed v is 88 fps.

The distance is 400 yards. Converting yards to feet: 400 * 3 = 1200 feet. So the train travels 1200 feet in the time it takes to pick up 15,000 lb of water.

I need to find the time taken to pick up the water. Since speed is distance over time, time t = distance / speed. So t = 1200 ft / 88 fps. Let me calculate that: 1200 / 88 ≈ 13.636 seconds.

Now, the train picks up 15,000 lb of water in 13.636 seconds. To find the rate at which the water is being picked up, that's mass flow rate m_dot = 15,000 lb / 13.636 s ≈ 1100.33 lb/s.

Wait, but actually, the force required is related to the momentum change per unit time. The formula for force F is m_dot * v, where m_dot is the mass flow rate. So F = (15,000 lb / t) * v.

Wait, but I have t as 13.636 seconds, so m_dot is 15,000 / 13.636 ≈ 1100.33 lb/s. Then F = 1100.33 lb/s * 88 fps. Let me compute that: 1100.33 * 88 ≈ 96,826.64 lb·fps. 

Wait, but lb·fps is a unit of force. Alternatively, since 1 horsepower (hp) is 550 ft·lbf/s, I can use that to find the power required.

Wait, but let me think again. The force F is the rate of momentum transfer, which is m_dot * v. So F = (15,000 lb / t) * v. But wait, 15,000 lb is the total mass, so m_dot is 15,000 lb / t, where t is the time in seconds. So t is 1200 ft / 88 fps ≈ 13.636 s. So m_dot is 15,000 / 13.636 ≈ 1100.33 lb/s.

Then F = m_dot * v = 1100.33 lb/s * 88 fps = 96,826.64 lb·ft/s², which is equivalent to pounds-force (since F=ma, and lb is a force unit when considering acceleration in ft/s²).

Wait, but lb is a unit of mass. Oh, right, in imperial units, lb can be confusing because it's used for both mass and force. So when we say 15,000 lb of water, that's mass in slugs. Because 1 slug is 32.174 lb-mass. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should treat the mass in pounds as mass in lbm (pound-mass). So 15,000 lbm of water is being picked up in 13.636 seconds. So m_dot = 15,000 lbm / 13.636 s ≈ 1100.33 lbm/s.

The force F is then m_dot * a, but since the water is being accelerated from rest to the speed of the train, the acceleration a is v / t, where v is 88 fps and t is 13.636 s. So a = 88 / 13.636 ≈ 6.444 fps².

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, since the train is moving at constant speed, the power required is the force multiplied by the velocity. So Power P = F * v. But I need to find F first.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The power required to accelerate the water is the rate at which kinetic energy is imparted. The kinetic energy per unit time is (1/2) m v². So P = (1/2) m v² / t.

But m is 15,000 lbm, and v is 88 fps. So P = 0.5 * 15,000 * (88)^2 / 13.636.

Wait, but before I proceed, I need to be careful with units. Let's make sure everything is in consistent units.

First, let's convert the mass from lbm to slugs because in the imperial system, mass is in slugs, and force in pounds. Remember that 1 slug = 32.174 lbm. So m = 15,000 lbm / 32.174 ≈ 466.02 slugs.

The velocity v is 88 fps. The time t is 13.636 seconds.

The kinetic energy KE is (1/2) m v². So KE = 0.5 * 466.02 slug * (88)^2 ft²/s².

Calculating that: 0.5 * 466.02 ≈ 233.01, multiplied by (88)^2 = 7744. So 233.01 * 7744 ≈ 1,812,088.64 slug·ft²/s². But slug·ft²/s² is equivalent to lb·ft, since F = ma, and slug is lb·s²/ft.

So KE ≈ 1,812,088.64 slug·ft²/s² = 1,812,088.64 lb·ft.

Then, power P is KE divided by time t: P = 1,812,088.64 / 13.636 ≈ 133,000 lb·ft/s.

Wait, but 1 horsepower is 550 ft·lbf/s. So to convert P from lb·ft/s to horsepower, divide by 550.

So P ≈ 133,000 / 550 ≈ 241.818 hp. Hmm, but none of the options are close to that. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of force and then power. The force required is the rate of change of momentum, which is F = m_dot * v. Here, m_dot is the mass flow rate, and v is the velocity. So F = (15,000 lbm / 13.636 s) * 88 fps.

But wait, in imperial units, mass is in slugs, so I need to convert 15,000 lbm to slugs: 15,000 / 32.174 ≈ 466.02 slugs. So m_dot = 466.02 slugs / 13.636 s ≈ 34.21 slug/s.

Then F = m_dot * v = 34.21 slug/s * 88 fps = 34.21 * 88 ≈ 3023 lb. So the force is approximately 3023 lb.

Then, power P is F * v = 3023 lb * 88 fps. But wait, that's in lb·ft/s, which is the same as ft·lbf/s. To convert to horsepower, divide by 550.

So P = (3023 * 88) / 550 ≈ (266,  I'll calculate 3023 * 88: 3000*88=264,000, plus 23*88=2,024 → total 266,024. Then 266,024 / 550 ≈ 483.68 hp. So approximately 484 hp.

Looking at the options, option F is 3025 lbw and 484 hp. That matches closely. So the answer should be F.
</think>

To solve the problem, we first convert the train's speed from 60 mph to feet per second (fps), resulting in 88 fps. The train travels 400 yards (1200 feet) at this speed, taking approximately 13.636 seconds. The train picks up 15,000 lb of water in this time, giving a mass flow rate of about 1100.33 lb/s. The force required is calculated as the product of the mass flow rate and velocity, yielding approximately 3023 lb. Using this force and the train's speed, the power is calculated as 484 hp. Comparing with the options, the closest match is **F: 3025 lbw and 484 hp**.
