Okay, so I have this question about physiological changes that occur during meditation. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I know that meditation is often associated with relaxation. So maybe some of the options relate to the body calming down. Let's look at the options one by one.

Option A: Stabilization of blood sugar levels. I'm not sure about this. I know stress can affect blood sugar, but does meditation directly stabilize it? Maybe indirectly by reducing stress, but I'm not certain.

Option B: Increased alpha and theta brain waves, lowered metabolism and heart rate. I remember reading that meditation can change brainwave patterns. Alpha waves are associated with relaxation, and theta with deeper states, like during sleep. Lowered metabolism and heart rate make sense because the body is more relaxed. So this seems plausible.

Option C: Heightened cortisol levels and stress response. Cortisol is a stress hormone, so if meditation reduces stress, this option doesn't seem right. It might actually lower cortisol.

Option D: Enhanced sympathetic nervous system activity. The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for the fight-or-flight response. Meditation is more about the parasympathetic (rest and digest), so this might not be correct.

Option E: Decrease in blood oxygen levels. I don't think meditation would lower oxygen. Maybe during deep breathing, oxygen might increase, but I'm not sure about a decrease.

Option F: Accelerated metabolic processes. Metabolism usually slows down during relaxation, so this might not be right.

Option G: Decreased brain wave activity. Wait, isn't meditation about brain activity becoming more coherent, maybe increasing some waves? Or maybe it's about a shift in types, not necessarily decreased overall. Not sure.

Option H: Increased heart rate and blood pressure. Again, meditation is calming, so this seems opposite.

Option I: Increased respiratory rate. Some forms of meditation involve deep breathing, which might increase the respiratory rate temporarily, but overall, I think it might slow down when relaxed.

Option J: Reduction in cognitive function. That doesn't make sense because meditation is often linked to improved focus and cognitive performance.

So, putting it together. The most likely correct answer is B: Increased alpha and theta brain waves, lowered metabolism and heart rate. This aligns with the relaxation response and changes in brain activity during meditation.

The correct answer is B: Increased alpha and theta brain waves, lowered metabolism and heart rate. Meditation is known to induce a relaxation response, which involves changes in brainwave patterns, reduced metabolic activity, and decreased heart rate. 

Answer: B
