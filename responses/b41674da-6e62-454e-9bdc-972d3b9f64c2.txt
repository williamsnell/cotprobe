Question:

Use indirect truth tables to determine whether the following argument is valid. If the argument is invalid, choose an option which presents a counterexample. (There may be other counterexamples as well.)
(A ∨ B) ⊃ C
C ⊃ ~D / D ⊃ A

Options:

A: Invalid. Counterexample when B and D are true and A and C are false
B: Valid. There are no counterexamples
C: Invalid. Counterexample when B, C, and D are true and A is false
D: Invalid. Counterexample when A, B, and C are false and D is true
E: Invalid. Counterexample when A, C, and D are true and B is false
F: Invalid. Counterexample when A, B, and C are true and D is false
G: Invalid. Counterexample when D is true, A, B and C are false
H: Invalid. Counterexample when B and C are true and A and D are false
I: Invalid. Counterexample when A is true, B, C and D are false
J: Valid

Alright, so I've got this logic problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out if the argument is valid using indirect truth tables. If it's invalid, I need to choose a counterexample from the options given. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me write down the argument as given. The premises are:

1. (A ∨ B) ⊃ C
2. C ⊃ ~D

And the conclusion is D ⊃ A.

So, the argument is: If either A or B is true, then C is true. And if C is true, then D is false. Therefore, if D is true, A must be true.

I remember that to check the validity of an argument using an indirect truth table, I need to assume that the premises are true and the conclusion is false. If this leads to a contradiction, the argument is valid. If not, then there's a counterexample where the premises are true, and the conclusion is false, making the argument invalid.

So, let me set up the indirect truth table. The conclusion is D ⊃ A, which is equivalent to ~D ∨ A. The negation of the conclusion would be D ∧ ~A. So, I need to assume that D is true and A is false.

Now, let's list the premises and the negation of the conclusion:

Premise 1: (A ∨ B) → C
Premise 2: C → ~D
Conclusion: D → A
Negation of Conclusion: D ∧ ~A

So, I assume D is true and A is false. Let's see what that implies for the premises.

Starting with the negation: D is true, and A is false.

From Premise 2: C → ~D. Since D is true, ~D is false. So, the implication C → ~D being true requires that either C is false or the whole implication holds. But wait, if ~D is false, then for C → ~D to be true, C must be false. Because in logic, if the consequent is false, the antecedent must be false for the implication to hold.

So, from Premise 2, if D is true, C must be false.

Now, looking at Premise 1: (A ∨ B) → C. Since we're assuming A is false, the left side becomes (False ∨ B), which simplifies to B. So, Premise 1 becomes B → C.

But from Premise 2, C is false. So, B → C is equivalent to ~B ∨ C. Since C is false, this becomes ~B. So, for Premise 1 to hold, B must be false.

So, under the assumption that D is true and A is false, we've deduced that C is false and B is false.

Let me summarize the values:

A: False
B: False
C: False
D: True

Now, I need to check if all the premises are true under these values.

Premise 1: (A ∨ B) → C
(A ∨ B) is (False ∨ False) = False
So, False → C. Since C is False, this becomes False → False, which is True? Wait, no. Wait, in logic, False → anything is True. Because the only time an implication is false is when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false.

So, (False) → (False) is True. So Premise 1 holds.

Premise 2: C → ~D
C is False, ~D is False (since D is True)
So, False → False is True. So Premise 2 holds.

Conclusion: D → A
D is True, A is False. So, True → False is False. So the conclusion is False, as expected in our assumption.

Wait, but I thought the conclusion is D → A, which is equivalent to ~D ∨ A. So when D is True and A is False, the conclusion is False. That's correct.

So, in this scenario, all premises are true, and the conclusion is false. Therefore, this is a counterexample, making the argument invalid.

Now, I need to check the options to see which one matches this scenario. The option should state that when B and D are true and A and C are false. Wait, no, in our case, B is False, D is True, A is False, C is False.

Wait, let's look at the options:

Option A: Invalid. Counterexample when B and D are true and A and C are false.

But in our case, B is False, D is True. So that's not matching. Option A says B is true, which contradicts our scenario.

Option D: Invalid. Counterexample when A, B, and C are false and D is true.

Yes, that's exactly our scenario. A is False, B is False, C is False, D is True. So this is a counterexample. Therefore, the answer should be D.

Wait, let me double-check the options.

Looking back:

Option D: Invalid. Counterexample when A, B, and C are false and D is true.

Yes, that's correct. So the argument is invalid, and D is the counterexample.

The argument is invalid, and the counterexample occurs when A, B, and C are false, and D is true.

Answer: D
