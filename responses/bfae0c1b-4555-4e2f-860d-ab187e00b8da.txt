Question:

A homeowner was injured when he slipped and fell in a puddle of water on his sunroom floor; the water had accumulated on the floor during a rainstorm because of leaks in the roof. The roof's manufacturer had supplied nondefective materials to the installer, who was a franchisee (and not an employee) of the manufacturer. The leaks resulted from the carelessness of the installer during the from the carelessness of the installer during the installation of the roof. The installer's truck, which had been parked in front of the homeowner's house during the roof installation, bore the manufacturer's logo. The manufacturer was aware that the truck and the literature supplied by the installer both displayed the manufacturer's logo. Is there any basis for a claim by the homeowner against the manufacturer?

Options:

A: Yes, because the manufacturer was aware that the installer used their logo.
B: Yes, because the installer was a franchisee of the manufacturer.
C: No, because the homeowner was responsible for choosing the installer.
D: Yes, because the installer's truck displayed the manufacturer's logo.
E: No, because the manufacturer only supplied nondefective materials.
F: No, because the leaks were due to the installer's negligence, not the manufacturer's.
G: No, because a franchisor has no duty to supervise the conduct of a franchisee.
H: Yes, under the rule of vicarious liability.
I: No, under the rule that a manufacturer is liable only for defects in a product that existed at the time the product left the hands of the manufacturer.
J: Yes, under the rule of apparent agency.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the homeowner can sue the manufacturer for his injuries. Let me break down the facts and the possible legal theories.

The homeowner slipped in a puddle of water caused by a leaky roof. The leak happened because the installer, who was a franchisee, installed the roof carelessly. The manufacturer provided nondefective materials, so that's not an issue. The installer's truck had the manufacturer's logo, and the manufacturer knew about this. So, the question is whether the manufacturer is liable.

First, I should consider the different liability theories here. One is product liability, another is premises liability, and then vicarious liability or apparent agency.

Since the manufacturer supplied nondefective materials, any product liability claims, like strict liability, probably don't apply because the product wasn't defective. So options E and I seem to suggest that, but I need to think if that's the only consideration.

Next, vicarious liability. Vicarious liability applies when an employer is responsible for the actions of its employees. But here, the installer is a franchisee, not an employee. The manufacturer knew about the logo on the truck, but that doesn't automatically make them liable for the franchisee's actions. Franchisors generally aren't vicariously liable for their franchisees' negligence unless there's a specific relationship that implies control, which isn't the case here. So H, which says vicarious liability, might not be correct.

Then there's apparent agency. Apparent agency is when a third party (the homeowner here) believes that the franchisee is an employee of the manufacturer because of the logo and branding. If the manufacturer allowed the franchisee to use their logo, the homeowner might think the installer is acting on behalf of the manufacturer. If that's the case, the manufacturer could be liable for the installer's negligence under the theory of apparent agency. So J is a possibility.

Looking at the options, J says yes under apparent agency. But I should make sure. The manufacturer knew the truck had their logo, so the homeowner might have reasonably thought the installer was representing the manufacturer. That could make the manufacturer liable for the installer's actions.

Other options: A says yes because the manufacturer was aware of the logo use, which ties into apparent agency. D says vicarious liability, which I think doesn't apply here because the franchisee isn't an employee. F says no because it's the installer's fault, but if apparent agency applies, the manufacturer could still be liable.

So, the main points are whether the manufacturer is liable through vicarious liability or apparent agency. Since vicarious liability doesn't fit (franchisee isn't an employee), it's more about apparent agency. The presence of the logo and the manufacturer's knowledge could support that the homeowner reasonably believed the installer was acting on behalf of the manufacturer. Therefore, the manufacturer could be liable under apparent agency, which is option J.

The homeowner can claim against the manufacturer under the theory of apparent agency because the installer's use of the manufacturer's logo created the impression that the installer was acting on behalf of the manufacturer. This makes the manufacturer liable for the installer's negligence.

Answer: J
