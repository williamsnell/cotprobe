Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again and break it down step by step.

The problem says: At West Elementary School, there are 20 more girls than boys. If there are 180 girls, how can you find the number of boys? The options are A through J, each suggesting a different mathematical operation.

Alright, let's parse this. There are more girls than boys by 20. So, the number of girls is equal to the number of boys plus 20. Or, in equation form, Girls = Boys + 20. That makes sense because if you have more girls, you add 20 to the number of boys to get the number of girls.

Wait, no, actually, since there are 20 more girls than boys, that means Girls = Boys + 20. So, if I know the number of girls is 180, I can plug that into the equation to find the number of boys.

So substituting the given number of girls: 180 = Boys + 20. To find the number of boys, I need to isolate Boys on one side. That means I should subtract 20 from both sides of the equation.

Let me write that out:
180 = Boys + 20
Subtract 20 from both sides:
180 - 20 = Boys
Which simplifies to:
160 = Boys

So the number of boys is 160. Now, looking at the options, I need to see which operation gets me from the number of girls (180) to the number of boys. The equation was Boys = Girls - 20. So in this case, we subtract 20 from the number of girls to get the number of boys.

Looking at the options, option H says subtract 20 from 180. That would be 180 - 20, which equals 160, the number of boys. So option H seems correct.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Sometimes these problems can be tricky. Let me double-check. If there are 20 more girls than boys, then if boys are B, girls are B + 20. Given girls are 180, so B + 20 = 180. Solving for B gives B = 180 - 20 = 160. Yep, that's right. So subtracting 20 from the number of girls gives the number of boys. So option H is the way to go.

Let me quickly glance at the other options to make sure none are trying to trick me. Option G is adding 20 to 180, which would make the boys more than the girls, which doesn't make sense because there are supposed to be fewer boys. Option J is subtracting 180 from 20, which is a negative number, so that's not possible. The other options involve multiplication or division, which don't fit the scenario here because we're dealing with a straightforward difference of 20 between the two groups.

So definitely, the correct operation is subtracting 20 from 180, which is option H.

The correct answer is H, subtract 20 from 180.
