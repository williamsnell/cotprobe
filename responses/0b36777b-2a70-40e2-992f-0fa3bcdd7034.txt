Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Pleistocene era and some landmasses. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking about two landmasses. The first part mentions the islands of Java, Sumatra, Bali, and Borneo. I remember that these are all in Southeast Asia. I think during the Pleistocene, especially during glacial periods, sea levels were lower, so land that's now underwater would have been exposed. So Java, Sumatra, etc., were connected to each other and maybe to a larger landmass.

The term I remember for that area is Sunda. I think the Sunda landmass refers to what's now Indonesia and parts of Southeast Asia. So the first blank should be Sunda.

The second part talks about the landmass connecting Australia, New Guinea, and Tasmania. I've heard of Sahul before. Sahul was the supercontinent that included Australia, New Guinea, and Tasmania during the last glacial maximum when the sea levels were lower. So the second blank should be Sahul.

Looking at the options, option A is Sunda; Sahul. That matches what I was thinking. Let me check the other options to be sure. Option B has Wallacea, which I think is a group of islands east of Borneo, so not the connecting landmass for Australia. Option H mentions Gondwana, which is an ancient supercontinent but not the Pleistocene ones. So yeah, A seems correct.

The islands of Java, Sumatra, Bali, and Borneo formed the Sunda landmass during the Pleistocene era, while the landmass connecting Australia, New Guinea, and Tasmania was known as Sahul. 

Answer: A
