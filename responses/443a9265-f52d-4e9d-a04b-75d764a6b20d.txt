Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The problem says that a cylinder has a total volume of 5 cubic meters. Initially, it contains 0.05 m³ of saturated liquid water and 4.95 m³ of saturated water vapor at 0.1 MPa. Heat is transferred until the cylinder is filled with saturated vapor. I need to calculate the amount of heat transferred during this process.

Hmm, I remember that when you heat a mixture of liquid and vapor, you can have a phase change. In this case, the heat will cause the liquid to vaporize until all the liquid is gone, and the rest is saturated vapor.

First, I should probably find the properties of the saturated water at 0.1 MPa. I think I need to look up the saturated temperature, specific volume of liquid (v_f), and specific volume of vapor (v_g). 

At 0.1 MPa (which is about 100 kPa), the saturated temperature is probably around 99.63°C. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact value, but I think that's correct. Now, the specific volume of the liquid, v_f, is usually very small. I remember that for water, v_f at 0.1 MPa is approximately 0.001 m³/kg. And v_g, the specific volume of the vapor, is about 0.4625 m³/kg. Wait, I'm not sure if those exact numbers are correct, but I'll go with them for now.

Next, I need to calculate the mass of the liquid and the mass of the vapor in the cylinder initially. 

The mass of the liquid (m_f) is the volume of liquid divided by v_f. So m_f = 0.05 m³ / 0.001 m³/kg = 50 kg. 

The mass of the vapor (m_g) is the volume of vapor divided by v_g. So m_g = 4.95 m³ / 0.4625 m³/kg. Let me calculate that: 4.95 / 0.4625. Hmm, 0.4625 times 10 is 4.625, so 4.95 is a bit more than that. Let me do the division: 4.95 ÷ 0.4625 ≈ 10.695 kg. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Oh wait, 0.4625 times 10 is 4.625, so 4.95 is about 4.95 / 0.4625 = approx 10.695 kg. So m_g ≈ 10.695 kg. 

Wait, that can't be right because 0.4625 m³/kg is the specific volume at 0.1 MPa, so 1 kg of vapor would occupy 0.4625 m³. So 4.95 m³ divided by 0.4625 gives 4.95 / 0.4625 ≈ 10.7 kg. Hmm, that's correct.

So the total mass in the cylinder is m_total = m_f + m_g = 50 kg + 10.7 kg ≈ 60.7 kg.

Now, after heating, the entire volume becomes saturated vapor at 0.1 MPa. So the total volume of 5 m³ will be filled with saturated vapor. Wait, but the initial vapor volume was 4.95 m³, and the final volume is 5 m³. So the volume of vapor increases by 0.05 m³. So the mass of vapor after heating should be m_total_final = m_total_initial + m_added, but wait, no. Alternatively, the final state is all vapor, so the total mass remains the same, but the specific volume changes.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The total mass of the system is the same because we're just heating it. So m_total = m_initial = m_final. 

In the initial state, we have m_f (50 kg) as liquid and m_g (10.7 kg) as vapor. So total mass is 60.7 kg. 

In the final state, the entire mass will be vapor, so m = 60.7 kg, and the specific volume v_g_final is the same as v_g_initial, because it's still at 0.1 MPa. Wait, but wait, no. Wait, when you heat a system at constant pressure, the temperature increases, and the specific volume of vapor changes. Wait, no, because we're dealing with a process at constant pressure where the system goes from a mixture to all vapor. So at 0.1 MPa, the saturated vapor's specific volume is v_g.

Wait, but the final state is saturated vapor at 0.1 MPa, so the specific volume of the vapor is still v_g = 0.4625 m³/kg. So the total volume after heating would be V_final = m_total * v_g = 60.7 kg * 0.4625 m³/kg ≈ 60.7 * 0.4625 ≈ let's calculate that.

60 * 0.4625 = 27.75 m³, and 0.7 * 0.4625 ≈ 0.32375 m³. So total is about 28.07375 m³. Wait, but the cylinder's volume is only 5 m³. That doesn't make sense. So I must have messed up something.

Wait, that can't be right. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the process. Maybe when the heat is added, the volume remains the same, 5 m³, so the specific volume adjusts accordingly. But wait, that's not possible because at 0.1 MPa, the specific volume of saturated vapor is 0.4625 m³/kg, so to fit 5 m³, the mass would be 5 / 0.4625 ≈ 10.76 kg. But that's way less than the initial 60.7 kg. That doesn't make sense because the mass should remain the same. So perhaps the process is not at constant pressure. Wait, the problem says the cylinder is filled with saturated vapor, but I think the pressure is kept constant. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, maybe I should approach this using the concept of enthalpy. The heat added will be the enthalpy required to vaporize the liquid. Because when you heat a mixture, the heat goes into increasing the temperature of the mixture and then into vaporizing the liquid. But in this case, since it's at the saturated temperature, perhaps the temperature remains constant during the phase change, and heat is used only for vaporization.

Wait, so perhaps the process is isobaric (constant pressure). So the initial state is a mixture of liquid and vapor at 0.1 MPa. When heat is added, the liquid starts to vaporize until all the liquid is gone, and the remaining is saturated vapor.

So the heat transfer Q would be the sum of two parts: heating the initial mixture and then vaporizing all the liquid.

Wait, but at constant pressure, the process from the initial state (mixture) to the final state (all vapor) would involve heating the mixture and then vaporizing the liquid.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the concept of enthalpy. The total enthalpy change would be the difference between the final enthalpy and the initial enthalpy.

In the initial state, the system has mass m_total = 60.7 kg, with m_f = 50 kg of liquid and m_g = 10.7 kg of vapor. The initial enthalpy H_initial is m_f * h_f + m_g * h_g.

At 0.1 MPa, h_f is about 417.5 kJ/kg and h_g is about 2392.1 kJ/kg. So H_initial = 50 * 417.5 + 10.7 * 2392.1.

Let me calculate that:

50 * 417.5 = 20,875 kJ

10.7 * 2392.1 ≈ 10 * 2392.1 = 23,921 + 0.7 * 2392.1 ≈ 1,674.47 → total ≈ 25,595.47 kJ

So H_initial ≈ 20,875 + 25,595.47 ≈ 46,470.47 kJ.

In the final state, all the mass is vapor, so H_final = m_total * h_g = 60.7 kg * 2392.1 kJ/kg.

Calculating that: 60 * 2392.1 = 143,526 kJ, and 0.7 * 2392.1 ≈ 1,674.47 → total ≈ 145,199.47 kJ.

So the heat added Q is H_final - H_initial = 145,199.47 - 46,470.47 ≈ 98,729 kJ.

Looking at the options, F is 99,000 kJ, which is close. So the answer would be F.

Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the heat required to vaporize the liquid. Because the initial vapor is already at 0.1 MPa, and the liquid is at the same pressure, so when heat is added, the liquid vaporizes, and the vapor increases in enthalpy as well.

Wait, but using the enthalpy method seems correct. The total heat added is the difference in enthalpy between the final and initial states.

Hmm, another approach: The heat added will be the mass of liquid times the latent heat at that pressure. The latent heat is h_fg = h_g - h_f. 

So, h_fg = 2392.1 - 417.5 ≈ 1974.6 kJ/kg.

The mass of liquid is 50 kg, so 50 * 1974.6 = 98,730 kJ, which matches the earlier calculation. So the answer is approximately 98,730 kJ, which is close to option F: 99,000 kJ. So F is the correct answer.

The problem involves calculating the heat required to convert 0.05 m³ of saturated liquid water and 4.95 m³ of saturated water vapor at 0.1 MPa into all saturated vapor. Using thermodynamic properties at 0.1 MPa, the specific volumes of liquid and vapor are approximately 0.001 m³/kg and 0.4625 m³/kg, respectively. The initial mass of liquid is 50 kg, and the initial mass of vapor is approximately 10.7 kg, giving a total mass of 60.7 kg.

The initial enthalpy is calculated as the sum of the enthalpies of the liquid and vapor phases:  
\[ H_{\text{initial}} = (50 \, \text{kg} \times 417.5 \, \text{kJ/kg}) + (10.7 \, \text{kg} \times 2392.1 \, \text{kJ/kg}) \approx 46,470.47 \, \text{kJ} \].

In the final state, all the mass is vapor, so the final enthalpy is:  
\[ H_{\text{final}} = 60.7 \, \text{kg} \times 2392.1 \, \text{kJ/kg} \approx 145,199.47 \, \text{kJ} \].

The heat transferred is the difference between the final and initial enthalpies:  
\[ Q = H_{\text{final}} - H_{\text{initial}} \approx 98,729 \, \text{kJ} \].

This value closely matches option F: 99,000 kJ.
