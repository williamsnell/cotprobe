Question:

Describe Sherman's and Key's (1932) study of the Hollow Children. What do their findings indicate about the effect of environment on intellectual development?

Options:

A: The study found no significant findings
B: Environment has no effect on intellectual development
C: The study shows that a deprived environment only affects intellectual development until a certain age
D: The study concluded that intellectual development is solely determined by genetics, not environment
E: The findings indicate that a stimulating environment has no impact on intellectual development
F: Sherman and Key's study indicates that a deprived environment has a detrimental effect on intellectual development
G: The research indicates that changes in the environment can reverse any prior intellectual development deficits
H: A deprived environment enhances intellectual development
I: Sherman and Key's research suggests that intellectual development is primarily influenced by peer interactions, not environment
J: Sherman and Key found that intellectual development is equally impacted by both deprived and enriched environments

Okay, so I've got this question about Sherman's and Key's 1932 study of the Hollow Children. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the Hollow Children refers to a group of children who were born with a condition that caused their skulls to be misshapen, giving them a hollow appearance. I think they were also known as the Romanian Orphans or something like that? Wait, no, maybe it's a different study. Oh, wait, I'm confusing it with another study. Let me get this straight.

Sherman and Key's study was about children who were born with a condition where their skulls were misshapen, but that's not the main point. The key aspect was their environment. I think these children were institutionalized and had very little stimulation in their early lives. They were kept in poor conditions, maybe in cribs with little interaction.

The question is about the effect of the environment on intellectual development. So, what did Sherman and Key find? I recall that the children in this study were compared to others who had similar medical conditions but were placed in more stimulating environments. The ones who were in the deprived environment had significant intellectual delays. This suggests that a lack of stimulation in the early years can have a negative impact on development.

Looking at the options now:

A: No significant findings. That doesn't sound right because the study is well-known for showing the effects of environment.

B: Environment has no effect. No, that's the opposite of what I remember.

C: Deprived environment affects until a certain age. I'm not sure about the age part. I think the study focused more on the impact rather than an age limit.

D: Intellectual development is solely genetics. No, the study was about environment affecting it, so this is incorrect.

E: Stimulating environment has no impact. No, the study likely showed that stimulation is important.

F: Deprived environment has a detrimental effect. Yes, that sounds familiar. The children in deprived environments didn't develop intellectually as well.

G: Changes can reverse deficits. I don't think the study concluded that; it might have been more about the lasting effects.

H: Deprived environment enhances development. That's definitely wrong.

I: Peer interactions are primary. The study was more about environmental stimulation, not peers.

J: Both environments equally impact. No, the study was about the negative impact of deprived environments, not equal impact.

So, option F seems correct. The findings indicate that a deprived environment is detrimental.

The study by Sherman and Key (1932) focused on children with skull deformities who were placed in deprived environments, such as institutions with minimal stimulation. These children showed significant intellectual delays compared to those in more stimulating environments. This highlights the detrimental effect of a deprived environment on intellectual development.

Answer: F
