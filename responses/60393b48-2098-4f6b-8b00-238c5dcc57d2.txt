Question:

A riot broke out in a city, and many shops had been looted and some had been burned during the riots. Goods of all kinds were in piles or strewn about the sidewalk. During the riot, a defendant was walking along the street when he paused in front of an appliance store. He picked up a portable television set that was lying on the sidewalk and started to walk off quickly. A police officer who was standing in front of the shop rushed after the defendant and arrested him. The defendant, an indigent, was charged with grand larceny, a felony carrying the maximum penalty of seven months imprisonment and a S 1,000 fine. At his arraignment, the judge advised the defendant of his right to have counsel appointed for him. The defendant, however, told the judge that he wanted to represent himself and waive his right to a jury trial. The judge then questioned the defendant at length about his demands. The defendant indicated that he had no previous legal experience. He told the judge that the reason he didn't want a court-appointed attorney to represent him was because he didn't trust lawyers. The judge did not find the defendant's reasons for representing himself to be persuasive and appointed an attorney to represent him. Thereafter, an attorney was appointed by the court to represent the defendant. The attorney told the court that the defendant wanted a non-jury trial. However, at the prosecution's request, the court impaneled a jury. The defendant was subsequently convicted by the jury and sentenced to six months imprisonment. In addition, the defendant was ordered to reimburse the state $450 to cover the cost of his attorney. This reimbursement order was made pursuant to a relevant statute in effect at the time of the defendant's arrest. The defendant appeals both the conviction and the reimbursement order. The appellate court should

Options:

A: affirm both the conviction and the reimbursement order.
B: affirm the conviction because the defendant was provided with an attorney, but reverse the reimbursement order.
C: reverse both the conviction and the reimbursement order because the defendant was not properly informed of his rights.
D: reverse the conviction because the defendant was not informed of the consequences of waiving his right to a jury trial, but affirm the reimbursement order.
E: reverse the conviction because the defendant was not allowed to represent himself, but affirm the reimbursement order.
F: affirm the conviction, but not the reimbursement order.
G: reverse both the conviction and the reimbursement order because the defendant was denied the right to represent himself.
H: reverse the reimbursement order because it exceeds the maximum fine for grand larceny, but affirm the conviction.
I: affirm the reimbursement order, but not the conviction.
J: reverse the conviction because he was denied the right to a non-jury trial, but not the reimbursement order.

Okay, so I've got this law question to work through, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read through the scenario again and break it down step by step.

So, the defendant was involved in a riot where shops were looted and burned. He picked up a TV from the sidewalk and tried to walk off with it. A police officer arrested him, and he was charged with grand larceny, which is a felony. The max penalty is seven months imprisonment and a $1,000 fine.

At arraignment, the judge told him about his right to a court-appointed attorney. But the defendant said he wanted to represent himself and waived his right to a jury trial. The judge questioned him and found that he had no legal experience and didn't trust lawyers. The judge wasn't persuaded and appointed an attorney anyway. The attorney then told the court the defendant wanted a non-jury trial, but the prosecution asked for a jury, which the court granted. The defendant was convicted by the jury and sentenced to six months, plus ordered to reimburse $450 for the attorney's costs.

He's appealing both the conviction and the reimbursement order. The question is what the appellate court should do.

Let me think about the key issues here. The defendant waived his right to a jury trial but was given one anyway. Also, he wanted to represent himself but was forced to have an attorney. Then there's the reimbursement for the attorney's fees.

First, the right to self-representation. In the US, the right to self-representation is protected under the 6th Amendment, as per the Supreme Court case Faretta v. California. However, the court has discretion to deny self-representation if it's clear that the defendant doesn't understand the consequences or if it's not a knowing and voluntary waiver.

In this case, the defendant had no legal experience and didn't trust lawyers. The judge questioned him about his reasons but appointed an attorney anyway, thinking his reasons weren't persuasive. So, the issue is whether the defendant was properly denied the right to represent himself.

If the judge didn't allow him to represent himself, then maybe his conviction should be reversed because he wasn't given what he wanted. But wait, the defendant was charged with a felony, and for felonies, the right to self-representation is more strictly applied. The court can't just force an attorney on someone who wants to represent themselves unless they're showing they can't handle it.

But in this case, the judge found his reasons unpersuasive but didn't let him proceed pro se. So, the appellate court would have to decide if the denial of self-representation was proper.

Next, the jury trial. The defendant waived his right to a jury but was given one anyway. The prosecution requested a jury, and the court impaneled one. The question is whether the defendant's waiver of the jury was valid.

Waiving a jury trial is a right that can be waived, but it must be done knowingly and voluntarily. Here, the defendant said he didn't want a jury, but the court overrode that because the prosecution wanted a jury. So, if the court didn't properly accept the waiver, the conviction could be reversed.

But wait, the defendant was forced to have an attorney because the judge didn't let him represent himself. So, if he wanted a bench trial (non-jury) but was forced to have an attorney, but the court gave him a jury anyway, there's a conflict here.

In the case where a defendant waives a jury trial, the prosecution can't force a jury unless the defendant's waiver was invalid. So, the court's decision to impanel a jury despite the defendant's waiver might be incorrect.

As for the reimbursement order, the state statute allowed for the defendant to be ordered to reimburse the costs of the attorney. The maximum fine is $1,000, and the reimbursement is $450, which is less. So, it's within the limit. Therefore, the reimbursement order is probably valid.

Putting it all together: The defendant's right to self-representation was denied, and his waiver of the jury was overridden. Therefore, the conviction should be reversed because he wasn't allowed to proceed as he wished, but the reimbursement order stands because it's within the statutory limits.

Looking at the options, option E says reverse the conviction because he wasn't allowed to represent himself, but affirm the reimbursement order. That seems to fit.

Wait, but another angle: The judge's denial of self-representation might be proper if the defendant wasn't competent to represent himself. But in Faretta, the court said the defendant's decision doesn't have to be wise, just knowing and voluntary. The defendant here had no legal experience but was an adult, so maybe the judge shouldn't have forced an attorney on him.

So, the appellate court would likely find that the defendant's right to self-representation was violated, leading to the conviction being reversed. The jury issue is a bit tricky because the defendant wanted a non-jury, but the court gave a jury, which might be a due process violation if the waiver was valid. But if the self-representation was denied, the jury issue might be moot because the defendant can't effectively waive a jury if he's not representing himself.

Wait, no, the defendant was forced to have an attorney, so the issue is whether the attorney can waive the jury on behalf of the defendant. But the defendant himself wanted a non-jury. So, the attorney's statement that the defendant wanted a non-jury should have been honored. Therefore, the court's action of impaneling a jury despite the defendant's waiver might be incorrect.

But since the defendant was denied the right to represent himself, the main issue is the self-representation. So, the conviction is reversed because he wasn't allowed to represent himself, but the reimbursement stands.

The defendant's right to self-representation was denied, and his waiver of the jury trial was overridden. The appellate court should reverse the conviction due to the denial of self-representation and affirm the reimbursement order as it is within statutory limits.
