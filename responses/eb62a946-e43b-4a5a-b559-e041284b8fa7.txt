Okay, so I have this physics problem here about gravitational force between two objects. Hmm, I remember that the gravitational force formula is F = G*(m1*m2)/r², where G is the gravitational constant. The question says that both masses are doubled and the distance between them is also doubled. I need to figure out how this affects the force.

Let me break it down. Originally, the force is F = G*(m1*m2)/(r²). Now, if each mass is doubled, m1 becomes 2m1 and m2 becomes 2m2. So the new mass product is (2m1)*(2m2) = 4m1m2. That's four times the original mass product.

Next, the distance is doubled. So the new distance r becomes 2r. The denominator in the formula is (2r)², which is 4r². So the denominator becomes four times larger.

Putting it together, the new force F' would be G*(4m1m2)/(4r²). The 4 in the numerator and denominator cancel out, so F' = G*(m1m2)/r², which is the same as the original F. 

Wait, so the force remains the same? That means doubling both masses and the distance doesn't change the gravitational force between them. So looking at the options, the correct answer should be that it remains the same. Let me check the options again. Option B: It remains the same. Yeah, that's the one.

The gravitational force between two objects depends on the product of their masses and inversely on the square of the distance between them. Doubling each mass increases the numerator by a factor of four, while doubling the distance increases the denominator by a factor of four. These changes cancel each other out, leaving the force unchanged.
