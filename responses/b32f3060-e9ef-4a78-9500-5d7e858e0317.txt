Okay, so I've got this question about gel electrophoresis, and I'm trying to figure out which statement is incorrect. I'm a bit rusty on my biology, but let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that gel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate DNA fragments based on their size. The basic idea is that DNA is negatively charged, so when you apply an electric current, it moves towards the positive electrode. Yeah, that's right. So looking at the options, option A says DNA migrates from positive to negative charge. Wait, no, wait. DNA is negative, so it should move towards the positive charge. So if the gel is set up with positive on one side and negative on the other, the DNA would go from negative to positive. So option A says it goes from positive to negative, which would be the opposite. So maybe A is incorrect?

Option B: Smaller DNA travels faster. That makes sense because smaller fragments move through the gel quicker than larger ones. So B is a correct statement, so it's not the answer.

Option C: The DNA migrates only when the current is running. Hmm. I think that's correct because without the electric current, there's no force moving the DNA. So when the current is off, the DNA doesn't migrate. So C is correct, so not the answer.

Option D: The longer the current is running, the farther the DNA will travel. Well, that seems logical. If you let the gel run longer, the DNA has more time to move, so it goes further. So D is correct, not the answer.

So putting it all together, the incorrect statement is option A because DNA moves towards the positive charge, not from positive to negative. So the answer should be A.

The incorrect statement is A because DNA migrates towards the positive charge, not from positive to negative.
