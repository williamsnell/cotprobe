Question:

Assume that a TLS connection has been established successfully between a client and a server. Establishing the session included checking the server certificate and executing a DiffieHelmann exchange, but the client did not provide a client certificate. Further, assume that the client and server are honest, that the client and server donâ€™t leak their keys, and that the cryptography is good. Which of the following attacks does TLS protect against?
1. An attacker replaying bytes that a client sent earlier.
2. An attacker impersonating the server.

Options:

A: True, True
B: True for the first attack, but only if the server leaks its keys
C: True, True for both attacks but only if the client provides a client certificate
D: True for the first attack, False for the second attack
E: False, False for both attacks
F: False, False
G: False for the first attack, but True for the second attack if the cryptography is not good
H: False, True
I: True, False
J: False for the first attack, True for the second attack

Okay, I need to figure out which attacks TLS protects against in this scenario. Let me start by understanding the setup.

So, a TLS connection is established between a client and a server. The session involved checking the server's certificate and a Diffie-Hellman exchange. The client didn't provide a certificate, meaning it's a mutual authentication only on the server side. Both client and server are honest, keys aren't leaked, and cryptography is good.

The question is about two attacks: replaying client bytes and impersonating the server.

First, replay attack: TLS uses sequence numbers to prevent replay attacks. Each packet is numbered, so the server knows if a packet is old and ignores it. So, TLS should protect against this.

Second, impersonation: Since the server's certificate was checked, the client knows it's talking to the right server. Without the client certificate, the server can't authenticate the client, but the server is authenticated. So, the client is protected from an attacker impersonating the server because the server's identity is verified during the handshake.

Wait, but without client authentication, can the server be impersonated? No, because the client has the server's certificate validated. So, the server is authenticated, but the client isn't. So, TLS would prevent the attacker from impersonating the server because the client checks the server's certificate.

So, both attacks are protected against. But wait, the options say which attacks are protected. Let's look at the options.

Option A says both are true. So TLS protects against both.

Wait, but in the scenario, the client didn't provide a certificate. Does that affect server impersonation? No, because the server's certificate is checked regardless of the client's authentication. So the client can be sure it's talking to the correct server. So the second attack (impersonation) is prevented.

So, both attacks are protected against. Therefore, the answer should be A: True, True.

Wait, but let me think again. Replay attack is prevented by sequence numbers and timestamps. So, yes, TLS protects against that.

Impersonation: The server's certificate was validated, so the client knows it's the right server. So TLS protects against that.

So, answer A: True for both.
</think>

TLS protects against both replay attacks by using sequence numbers and prevents server impersonation by validating the server's certificate. 

Answer: A
