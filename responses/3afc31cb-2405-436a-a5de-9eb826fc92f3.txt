Question:

Explain the types and effects of competition.

Options:

A: Competition is the active demand of two or more organisms for a common vital resource. It can be categorized into Contest competition and Scramble competition.
B: Competition is a cooperative interaction where organisms work together to maximize resource use.
C: Competition only involves physical confrontation.
D: Competition is solely determined by the availability of water resources.
E: Competition is an interaction that only occurs within a species, known as Intraspecific competition.
F: Competition can be categorized into Predation competition and Mutualism competition.
G: Competition is a natural process that always results in the extinction of one species.

Okay, so I have this question about competition in biology, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me break it down step by step.

The question asks to explain the types and effects of competition, and then select the correct option from A to J. Hmm, I remember that competition in ecology refers to the interaction between organisms where they compete for resources. But I need to think about the different types and what each option says.

Option A says competition is the active demand for a common vital resource and it's categorized into Contest and Scramble competition. I think Contest competition is when organisms directly compete, like fighting for food, while Scramble competition is when they all try to find resources as quickly as possible without direct conflict. That sounds familiar from my studies.

Option B talks about cooperation. Wait, that's not right because competition is the opposite of cooperation. So B is probably wrong.

Option C says competition only involves physical confrontation. No, that's not true because competition can be indirect, like plants competing for light without physical contact. So C is incorrect.

Option D claims competition is solely about water. That's too narrow because resources can be food, space, light, etc. So D is wrong.

Option E states competition only occurs within a species, which is intraspecific. I remember that competition can also be interspecific, between different species. So E is incorrect.

Option F categorizes competition into Predation and Mutualism. Wait, Predation is a type of interaction where one organism eats another, and Mutualism is a beneficial interaction between species. Those aren't types of competition; competition is separate. So F is wrong.

Option G says competition always results in extinction. That's not accurate because competition can lead to various outcomes like species adaptation or coexistence, not necessarily extinction. So G is incorrect.

So, going back, Option A seems correct because it accurately defines competition and correctly categorizes it into Contest and Scramble types. The other options either describe other interactions or have incorrect categories.

The correct answer is A, as it accurately describes competition and its types.

Answer: A
