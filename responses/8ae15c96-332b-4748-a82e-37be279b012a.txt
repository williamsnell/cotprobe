Question:

A man claims to have inherited property from a wealthy businessman. The man's birth certificate shows that he was born out of wedlock. The record of a proceeding for a support order shows that the businessman was adjudged to be father of the man. However, the man can establish his status as heir of the businessman only if he was legitimated by the marriage of his mother and the businessman subsequent to his birth. Thus, the man must prove that this marriage occurred. The man's attorney has not been able to discover any marriage license or certificate. However, the attorney does have a photograph that shows a couple dressed in wedding clothes. The scene is the front of a church. Bystanders are seen to be throwing rice at the couple and they seem to be responding by smiling and bowing down. The attorney was given the photograph by the man. He found it in his mother's effects following her death. The man believes that the bride in the picture is his mother. He cannot identify the groom. The attorney was informed by a former acquaintance of the businessman who has seen the snapshot that he thinks the groom is the businessman. If the attorney seeks to introduce the photograph as proof that the mother and the businessman were married, the trial judge should rule the photograph

Options:

A: inadmissible as not the best evidence.
B: admissible, only if a witness verifies that it is a correct and accurate representation of the relevant facts.
C: inadmissible as non-verbal hearsay not within any recognized exception.
D: admissible, only if a former acquaintance of the businessman can identify the groom in the photograph.
E: inadmissible, as it does not provide conclusive evidence of a marriage.
F: admissible, only if the man can provide additional evidence supporting his claim that the woman in the picture is his mother.
G: admissible, only if the photographer is available to testify concerning the circumstances under which the photograph was taken.
H: admissible, only if the church where the photograph was taken confirms it was the venue for the mother and the businessman's wedding.
I: inadmissible, as the photograph could be misinterpreted or manipulated.
J: admissible, only if the man can positively identify the groom as the businessman.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out the answer to this evidence question. Let me break it down step by step.

So, the scenario is about a man trying to prove he inherited property because he was legitimated by his mother's marriage to a businessman after his birth. The key issue is whether a photograph is admissible to prove that the marriage happened.

First, the man's attorney has no marriage license or certificate, which are usually the best forms of proof for marriage. But he has this photo. The photo shows a couple in wedding clothes at a church, with bystanders throwing rice and the couple smiling and bowing. The man believes the bride is his mother, but he can't identify the groom. A former acquaintance of the businessman thinks the groom is the businessman.

The question is whether the photograph is admissible as evidence of the marriage.

I remember that in evidence law, photographs can sometimes be admitted if they qualify under certain exceptions to hearsay. But here, the photo itself is being offered to prove that a marriage occurred. So, what's the hearsay issue?

Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. The photo isn't a statement; it's a visual depiction. However, the problem is whether it's being offered for the truth—that the marriage happened. So, if the photo is being used to show that the marriage occurred, then it's not hearsay because it's not a statement; it's a visual representation. Wait, no—actually, the photo is a record made by someone else (the photographer) that's being offered to prove the event (the marriage). So, under the rules, this might fall under a hearsay exception if the foundation is properly laid.

Alternatively, there's the best evidence rule. The best evidence rule (Rule 1002) says that to prove the content of a writing, recording, or photograph, the original must be produced unless exceptions apply. But here, the photo is being offered to prove that a marriage occurred, not the content of the photo itself. So maybe the best evidence rule doesn't apply here because we're not trying to prove the content of the photograph, but rather the event it depicts.

Wait, but if the photo is being offered to prove that the marriage happened, is it being used as real evidence (like a deed) or as a record? I think it's more about the event, so the best evidence rule might not bar it.

But then, the main issue is whether the photo is admissible. For a photograph to be admitted, it needs to be authenticated. Authentication means establishing that the photograph is what it's claimed to be. So, for the photo to be admitted, someone must testify that it's a true and accurate depiction of the event. In this case, the man believes the bride is his mother, but he can't identify the groom. His attorney got the photo from the man, found it in his mother's effects. A former acquaintance thinks the groom is the businessman.

So, can the photo be authenticated? The man could testify that the woman in the photo is his mother. But he can't identify the groom. The acquaintance thinks it's the businessman. So, the attorney might call the acquaintance to testify that the groom in the photo is the businessman. If that person can identify the groom, then the photo is authenticated as depicting the marriage of the mother and the businessman.

Alternatively, the acquaintance's identification would be necessary to authenticate the groom's identity. Without that, the photo might not be authenticated because we don't know who the groom is. The man can't identify him, so without the acquaintance's testimony, the photo's relevance is limited.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option B says it's admissible only if a witness verifies it's correct. That makes sense because authentication is needed. So, a witness (like the acquaintance) would need to testify that the photo accurately represents the marriage.

Option D says it's admissible only if the former acquaintance can identify the groom. That's also about authentication, as the acquaintance would need to confirm who the groom is.

Option J requires the man to positively identify the groom as the businessman, but the man can't do that, so J would likely be incorrect.

Option E says it's inadmissible because it doesn't provide conclusive evidence. But the standard isn't about being conclusive; it's about whether it's admissible. Even if it's not conclusive, it can still be admitted as evidence for the jury to consider.

Option C says it's inadmissible as non-verbal hearsay. But the photo isn't hearsay because it's not an out-of-court statement offered for the truth. It's a visual record, so C might not be correct.

Option A is about best evidence. Since we're not trying to prove the content of the photo but the event, A is probably not the right reason for inadmissibility.

So, the main issue is authentication. The photo needs to be connected to the facts it's supposed to illustrate. Without a witness (like the acquaintance) identifying the groom as the businessman, the photo can't be authenticated. Therefore, the photograph is inadmissible unless a witness can verify it's accurate.

Looking at the options, option B says it's admissible only if a witness verifies it's correct. That fits because the acquaintance can testify the groom is the businessman, authenticating the photo.

Alternatively, option D says it's admissible only if the acquaintance can identify the groom. That's the same as B, but phrased differently. So which is correct?

Wait, the question is about whether the photograph is admissible as proof of marriage. The key is whether it's authenticated. The acquaintance can authenticate the photo by identifying the groom as the businessman. So, without that, the photo isn't authenticated.

So, the correct ruling would be that the photo is inadmissible unless a witness verifies its accuracy. So, the answer would be B.

Wait, but another angle: the photo itself isn't hearsay. It's a physical object. But it's being offered to prove the event (marriage). So, the issue isn't hearsay; it's authentication. So, the photo is admissible if it's authenticated. Authentication can be done by a witness who can identify the people in the photo.

In this case, the acquaintance can identify the groom as the businessman. So, the photo can be admitted if the acquaintance testifies that the groom is the businessman, thereby authenticating the photo as depicting their wedding.

So, the answer is B: admissible only if a witness verifies it's correct.

Wait, but some might argue that the photo itself is not enough; you need someone to say it's a wedding. But the photo shows a church, rice, smiling, bowing, which are circumstances that suggest a wedding. So, maybe the photo can be authenticated by showing that it depicts a wedding, without needing someone to say it's a wedding.

But the main issue is identifying who the people are. Without identifying the groom, the photo doesn't prove the marriage to the businessman. So, the acquaintance's testimony is needed to connect the groom to the businessman.

So, the correct answer is D: admissible only if the former acquaintance can identify the groom.

Wait, but the acquaintance can only say he thinks it's the businessman. Is that enough? It depends on the witness's ability to identify. If the acquaintance recognizes the businessman, then yes. So, the photo is admissible if the acquaintance can identify the groom.

So, looking at the options, D requires the acquaintance to identify the groom. That would authenticate the photo as the marriage of the mother and the businessman.

Thus, the correct answer is D.

Wait, but another thought: the best evidence rule doesn't apply here because we're not trying to prove the content of the photo, but the event it depicts. So, the photo is real evidence, not hearsay. But to authenticate it, you need a witness to connect it to the event.

So, in this case, the photo is admissible if a witness can verify that it's a correct representation. So, option B.

But the witness can only say that the groom is the businessman. That's enough to authenticate the photo as depicting their wedding.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused between B and D. Let me check the rules.

The Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) 901(a) requires the proponent to produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what it is claimed to be. So, for a photograph, authentication can be done by showing it's a depiction of an event, and identifying the people in it.

In this case, the acquaintance can testify that the groom is the businessman, which would authenticate the photo as depicting their wedding. So, the photo is admissible if the acquaintance can identify the groom.

Therefore, the answer is D: admissible only if the former acquaintance can identify the groom in the photograph.

The photograph can be admitted as evidence if a witness, such as the former acquaintance, can identify the groom as the businessman, thereby authenticating the photo as depicting their marriage.
