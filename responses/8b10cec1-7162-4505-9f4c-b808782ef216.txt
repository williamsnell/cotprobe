Question:

The expected selling price for a new product is $19.00. Management's goal is to obtain a 20% contribution margin on all sales. If the new product has variable selling and distribution costs of $3.00 per unit what is the product's target variable manufacturing cost?

C: $13.50
D: $15.80
E: 18.2
F: $16.20

H: $12.20
I: $12.80
J: $14.00

Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the target variable manufacturing cost for a new product. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on contribution margin, but I'll do my best.

Alright, the expected selling price is $19.00. Management wants a 20% contribution margin on all sales. The variable selling and distribution costs are $3.00 per unit. I need to find the target variable manufacturing cost.

First, I remember that the contribution margin is the difference between the selling price and the variable costs. But wait, the contribution margin can be expressed in dollars or as a percentage. Here, it's given as 20%, so that's a percentage of the selling price, I think.

So, the formula for contribution margin ratio is (Selling Price - Variable Costs) / Selling Price = Contribution Margin Ratio.

We're told the ratio is 20%, so 0.20. Let me write that down:

(19 - Variable Costs) / 19 = 0.20

Wait, but Variable Costs here include both the manufacturing costs and the selling and distribution costs, right? Because variable costs per unit would be all the costs that vary with production, including distribution and manufacturing.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The problem says the variable selling and distribution costs are $3.00. So, the total variable costs per unit would be the manufacturing cost plus $3.00.

So, if I let CM be the contribution margin in dollars, then:

CM = Selling Price - Total Variable Costs
But since the contribution margin ratio is 20%, CM = 0.20 * Selling Price.

So, 0.20 * 19 = $3.80. That's the contribution margin per unit.

Wait, that makes sense because 20% of $19 is $3.80. So, the contribution margin is $3.80 per unit.

Now, the total variable costs per unit would be Selling Price - Contribution Margin. So,

Total Variable Costs = 19 - 3.80 = $15.20.

But wait, the total variable costs include both the variable selling and distribution costs and the variable manufacturing costs. So, Variable Manufacturing Cost + $3.00 (distribution) = $15.20.

So, Variable Manufacturing Cost = 15.20 - 3.00 = $12.20.

Hmm, looking at the options, H is $12.20. So, that should be the answer.

Let me double-check. If the manufacturing cost is $12.20, then total variable costs are 12.20 + 3 = $15.20. Selling price is $19. So, contribution margin is 19 - 15.20 = $3.80, which is 20% of 19. Yep, that works.

The target variable manufacturing cost is calculated by determining the contribution margin and subtracting the variable selling and distribution costs from the total variable costs. 

Answer: H
