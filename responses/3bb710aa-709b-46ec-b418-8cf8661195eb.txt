Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an athlete spinning a discus. Hmm, let me read it again. The discus is moving in a circle with a radius of 80.0 cm. At a certain moment, the athlete's rotating at 10.0 rad/s and the angular speed is increasing at 50.0 rad/s². I need to find the magnitude of the acceleration at that instant. The answer should be in m/s².

Alright, I remember that when something moves in a circle, there are two types of acceleration: centripetal and tangential. Centripetal is the one that's directed towards the center, keeping the object moving in a circle, and tangential is along the tangent, which is related to angular acceleration.

Wait, so the total acceleration is the vector sum of these two. Since centripetal is perpendicular to tangential, I can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the magnitude. Oh right, because they're perpendicular, so the magnitude of the acceleration a is sqrt( (a_c)^2 + (a_t)^2 ), where a_c is centripetal and a_t is tangential.

Let me write down the given values. The radius r is 80.0 cm, which I should convert to meters since the answer needs to be in m/s². So, 80 cm is 0.8 meters. The angular velocity ω is 10.0 rad/s, and the angular acceleration α is 50.0 rad/s².

First, I'll find the centripetal acceleration. The formula for centripetal acceleration is a_c = ω² * r. Plugging in the numbers: a_c = (10)^2 * 0.8 = 100 * 0.8 = 80 m/s². Okay, that seems right.

Next, the tangential acceleration a_t is given by a_t = α * r. So a_t = 50 * 0.8 = 40 m/s². Got that down.

Now, to find the total acceleration, I'll square both a_c and a_t, add them, and take the square root. So, a_total = sqrt( (80)^2 + (40)^2 ) = sqrt(6400 + 1600) = sqrt(8000). Let me calculate that. The square root of 8000 is... Hmm, 89.4427 approximately. Looking at the options, option C is 89.4, which matches this value.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations. Centripetal: 10 squared is 100, times 0.8 is 80. Tangential: 50 times 0.8 is 40. Then sqrt(80² +40²)=sqrt(6400+1600)=sqrt(8000). Yep, that's right. Square root of 8000 is 89.44, so option C is the correct answer.

The athlete's discus undergoes both centripetal and tangential acceleration. Centripetal acceleration is calculated as \( a_c = \omega^2 r = 10^2 \times 0.8 = 80 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), and tangential acceleration is \( a_t = \alpha r = 50 \times 0.8 = 40 \, \text{m/s}^2 \). The total acceleration is the square root of the sum of their squares: \( \sqrt{80^2 + 40^2} = \sqrt{8000} \approx 89.4 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).

Answer: C
