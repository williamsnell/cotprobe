Okay, so I've got this biology question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about an unborn vertebrate animal that has developed to the point of having the basic structure characteristic of its kind. The options are from A to J, each with a different term.

First, I need to understand the terms given. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: a pupa. I remember that a pupa is a stage in insect development, like when a caterpillar turns into a butterfly. So that's more about insects, not vertebrates. So probably not A.

Option B: an embryo. An embryo is an early stage of development, right? It's after the fertilization and before significant organ development. So an embryo doesn't have the basic structures yet, or does it? Wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Embryos do develop into fetuses, so maybe the next stage.

Option C: a gamete. Gametes are the reproductive cells, like sperm and eggs. They're the ones that combine to form zygotes. So that's not the stage after fertilization; it's before. So C is not it.

Option D: a larva. Again, this is a term used in insects and other invertebrates. Like how a tadpole is a larva of a frog. But the question specifies vertebrates, so maybe not D. Or wait, some vertebrates have larvae, like frogs. But I think the term used for the next stage after embryo in vertebrates is different.

Option E: a neonate. Neonate refers to a newborn, like a newborn baby. So that's after birth, not before. The question is about an unborn animal, so E is probably not the answer.

Option F: a juvenile. Juvenile is a stage after infancy but before adulthood. So again, that's after birth, not the stage inside the womb.

Option G: a fetus. Fetus is the term used for the stage of development in vertebrates after the embryo stage, right? So after the organs are formed and the baby is developing into its final form. That sounds like it fits the description in the question.

Option H: a zygote. A zygote is the very first stage, the fertilized egg. It's just a single cell, so it's way before the structures are formed. So H is too early.

Option I: a blastocyst. That's the stage after the zygote, when it starts to divide into a group of cells. In humans, the blastocyst is what implants into the uterus. But it's still not the point where the basic structures are formed; that comes later.

Option J: a hatchling. Hatchling is like a baby bird that just hatched from an egg. But again, that's after birth, so J isn't the right choice here.

So putting it all together: the question is about an unborn vertebrate that has developed to have the basic structures. The options point towards the fetal stage, which is G. The embryo is earlier, and the fetus is the next stage where the animal has the recognizable form. So the answer should be G.

The correct answer is G: a fetus. 

Answer: G
