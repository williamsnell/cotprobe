Question:

Two cars were driving within the legal speed limit as they approached an intersection. There are no traffic lights, stop signs, or warnings posted at this intersection. Both vehicles entered the intersection simultaneously and collided. In the accident, one of the drivers suffered a broken pelvis and internal injuries. Although the other driver's truck was slightly damaged, he did not suffer any physical injuries. Thereafter, the injured driver sued the city for negligence, claiming that the city failed to provide adequate warning at the intersection, which she contended was particularly dangerous and heavily traveled. At trial, the city attorney offers evidence that the intersection has been the same for 14 years, and no other accidents have occurred during that time. Upon objection by the injured driver's attorney, this evidence should be

Options:

A: excluded, because it is improper negative evidence.
B: admitted as relevant evidence of a fact of consequence to the action.
C: admitted, as it is critical for the jury to understand the history of the intersection.
D: excluded, because the dangers of unfair prejudice and confusion of the issues may tend to mislead the jury.
E: admitted, but only if the city can prove that there have been no significant changes in traffic patterns in the last 14 years.
F: excluded, because it can potentially bias the jury against the injured driver.
G: excluded, because it is irrelevant to the current accident.
H: admitted, as it shows the city's negligence in maintaining the intersection.
I: excluded, as it is not directly related to the case at hand.
J: admitted, provided that the jury is instructed about the danger of inferential negative evidence.

Alright, so I've got this law question here about evidence in a negligence case. Let me try to break it down. Okay, the scenario is two cars going through an intersection without any traffic lights or signs. They enter at the same time and collide. One driver is injured, the other isn't but their truck is a bit damaged. The injured driver is suing the city, claiming the city was negligent because they didn't provide adequate warnings at a dangerous intersection.

Now, the city attorney is offering evidence that the intersection has been the same for 14 years and no other accidents have happened during that time. The injured driver's attorney is objecting, and the question is about whether this evidence should be admitted or excluded.

Hmm, I remember that in tort law, especially negligence cases, the plaintiff has to prove that the defendant's negligence was the cause of the harm. So the injured driver is arguing that the city's failure to warn was a breach of their duty of care, leading to the accident.

The city is trying to bring in this evidence about 14 years of no accidents. I think this might be an example of what's called "negative evidence" or "accident frequency evidence." I remember that in some cases, the fact that no prior accidents occurred can be used to show that the condition wasn't dangerous, but I also recall that there's a principle against using such evidence as "proof by negative."

Wait, there's the "res ipsa loquitur" concept, but I don't think that's directly applicable here. More relevant is the idea that the absence of prior accidents doesn't necessarily prove that the condition wasn't negligent. Because maybe the intersection is dangerous but just hasn't had an accident yet, or maybe the conditions change over time.

I think the key here is whether the evidence is relevant. For it to be admissible, it must be relevant to a fact at issue. The city is trying to show that since there were no prior accidents, their failure to warn wasn't negligent. But is that a valid use of the evidence?

I remember that in some cases, the court holds that the lack of prior accidents isn't sufficient to prove that the defendant wasn't negligent. So the city can't just say, "Well, no one else crashed here, so we were fine." There's a principle that you can't prove a negative with such evidence.

So if the city's attorney offers this evidence, the injured driver's attorney would likely object on the grounds that it's irrelevant or that it's improper negative evidence. The question is whether the court should exclude it.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Excluded because it's improper negative evidence. That seems possible because the idea is that you can't use the absence of accidents to prove safety.

Option B: Admitted as relevant. But I don't think it's relevant because the lack of accidents doesn't directly show that the city acted reasonably.

Option D: Excluded due to unfair prejudice. Maybe, but the main issue is relevance, not just prejudice.

Option G: Excluded because irrelevant. That also makes sense because prior accidents aren't directly relevant to whether the city was negligent in this case.

Wait, but in some cases, the court allows such evidence for the defense to show that the plaintiff's claim is without merit. For example, if the intersection is generally safe, then the city's duty might not require warnings. But I think the admissibility depends on whether the evidence is being used to prove that the condition wasn't dangerous (which is a factual issue) or whether it's being used to show that the city wasn't negligent because no one else was hurt.

I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The city is introducing this to show that the intersection hasn't been a problem before, implying that their failure to warn wasn't negligent. But the injured driver's argument is that the intersection is inherently dangerous, so the city should have warned.

In some jurisdictions, the court excludes such evidence because it's irrelevant to whether the defendant was negligent. The fact that others didn't have accidents doesn't prove the intersection wasn't dangerous. It's more about whether the city had a duty to warn, not whether the duty was breached based on past accidents.

So the evidence is being offered to show that because there were no prior accidents, the city wasn't negligent. But that's an improper use because the absence of accidents doesn't speak to the foreseeability or the breach of duty. Therefore, the evidence should be excluded as improper negative evidence.

Looking at the options, A says it's excluded because it's improper negative evidence. That aligns with what I'm thinking.

The city's evidence about the intersection's history of no accidents over 14 years is being offered to imply that the intersection was not dangerous, thereby suggesting the city's failure to warn was not negligent. However, the absence of prior accidents does not directly prove that the intersection was safe or that the city was not negligent. This type of evidence is often excluded because it is considered improper negative evidence, as it does not sufficiently address the issue of negligence or the city's duty to provide warnings. Therefore, the evidence should be excluded.
