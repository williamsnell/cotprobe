Okay, so I've got this logic problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about determining whether two propositions are logically equivalent, contradictory, consistent, or inconsistent. The propositions given are I and ~H, and the second one is ~(~I ≡ H). Hmm, I think I need to construct a truth table for these two propositions and then compare them.

First, I remember that in logic, propositions can be either true or false, so I should list all possible combinations of truth values for H and I. Since there are two variables, H and I, there are 2^2 = 4 possible combinations. Let me list them out:

1. H is true, I is true
2. H is true, I is false
3. H is false, I is true
4. H is false, I is false

Now, for each of these, I'll compute the value of each proposition.

The first proposition is I, which is straightforward. The second proposition is ~(~I ≡ H). Let me break that down. The ≡ symbol means equivalence, so ~I ≡ H is true when ~I and H have the same truth value. Then, the negation outside (~) will flip that result.

Wait, maybe I should compute each part step by step. Let's take each case one by one.

Case 1: H = T, I = T
- Proposition I: T
- Compute ~I: F
- Compute ~I ≡ H: F ≡ T → F (since F and T are not equivalent)
- Then ~ of that: T
So the second proposition is T.

Case 2: H = T, I = F
- Proposition I: F
- Compute ~I: T
- Compute ~I ≡ H: T ≡ T → T
- Then ~ of that: F
So the second proposition is F.

Case 3: H = F, I = T
- Proposition I: T
- Compute ~I: F
- Compute ~I ≡ H: F ≡ F → T
- Then ~ of that: F
So the second proposition is F.

Case 4: H = F, I = F
- Proposition I: F
- Compute ~I: T
- Compute ~I ≡ H: T ≡ F → F
- Then ~ of that: T
So the second proposition is T.

Now, let me tabulate these results:

| H | I | Proposition I (I) | ~I | ~I ≡ H | ~(~I ≡ H) |
|---|---|-------------------|----|--------|------------|
| T | T | T                 | F  | F      | T          |
| T | F | F                 | T  | T      | F          |
| F | T | T                 | F  | T      | F          |
| F | F | F                 | T  | F      | T          |

Wait, let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

In case 3, H is F, I is T. So ~I is F. Then, ~I ≡ H is F ≡ F, which is T. So ~(~I ≡ H) is F. That looks correct.

In case 4, H is F, I is F. So ~I is T. ~I ≡ H is T ≡ F, which is F. So the negation is T. Correct.

So the second proposition's truth values are T, F, F, T in the four cases.

Now, let's compare the two propositions: the first is I, which has values T, F, T, F. The second proposition is T, F, F, T.

Looking at the columns:

I: T, F, T, F
~(~I ≡ H): T, F, F, T

So in each case, the two propositions have the same truth value when:

Case 1: I=T, second=T → same
Case 2: I=F, second=F → same
Case 3: I=T, second=F → different
Case 4: I=F, second=T → different

Wait, that's not matching. Wait, in case 3, I is T, and the second is F. So they are different in cases 3 and 4. So the two propositions are not equivalent because their truth values don't match in all cases.

Next, are they contradictory? Contradictory means that they are always opposite, i.e., whenever one is T, the other is F, and vice versa. Let's check:

In case 1: I=T, second=T → same, so not contradictory.
In case 2: I=F, second=F → same, so not contradictory.
So since they are the same in some cases and different in others, they are neither equivalent nor contradictory.

Now, are they consistent or inconsistent? Consistent means that there's at least one case where both are true. Inconsistent means they can't both be true at the same time.

Looking at the truth table:

Case 1: I=T, second=T → both true. So they are consistent because there's a case where both are true.

Wait, no. Wait, the term "consistent" in logic usually refers to whether the propositions can be true together. If there's any row where both are true, they are consistent; otherwise, inconsistent.

In case 1, I=T and second=T, so both are true. So they are consistent.

So, the two propositions are neither equivalent nor contradictory, but they are consistent.

Looking at the options, option A is: Neither logically equivalent nor contradictory, but consistent.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are there any cases where both are true? Yes, case 1. So they are consistent.

So the answer should be option A.

The propositions I and ~(~I ≡ H) are neither logically equivalent nor contradictory, but they are consistent because there is a case where both are true.

Answer: A
