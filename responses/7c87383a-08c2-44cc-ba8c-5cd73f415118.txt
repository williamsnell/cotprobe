B: 12.5% chance
C: 50% chance
D: 66% chance
E: 10% chance
F: 33% chance
G: No chance

I: 100% chance
J: 75% chance

Okay, so I have this genetics problem here about hemophilia, and I need to figure out the probability that their next child, if a girl, would have hemophilia. Hmm, let me think.

First, I remember that hemophilia is a recessive trait and it's sex-linked, meaning it's carried on the X chromosome. So, males have only one X (from their mother) and one Y (from their father), while females have two X's, one from each parent.

The question says the couple is phenotypically normal, so both parents don't have hemophilia. But they had a son with hemophilia. Wait, sons get their X from the mother and Y from the father. So if the son has hemophilia, that means his X must carry the recessive allele. So the mother must be a carrier. Because the father can't pass hemophilia to his son, since he gives a Y. So the mother must have one X with the recessive allele and the other normal.

So the mother's genotype must be XHXh (where H is normal and h is hemophilia). The father must be XY, because he's phenotypically normal. So he can only pass his X or Y to his children. Wait, no, the father's genotype is XY, so he contributes either X or Y to the child. But wait, no, the mother's genotype is XHXh, and the father is XY. Wait, no, wait, the father can't have hemophilia because he's phenotypically normal. So the father must have XHY? No, wait, no, that's not right. Wait, males have XY, so if the father is normal, he must have XHY? No, wait, that's not right. Wait, no, males have one X and one Y. So the father must have XHY? No, wait, no, the father's genotype is XY, with X being normal and Y. So the father's genotype is XY, where X is normal.

So the mother is XHXh (since she's a carrier), because she has one affected son. Because if the father was XhY, he would have hemophilia, but the problem states that the couple is phenotypically normal, so the father must be XY with the X normal.

Wait, no. Wait, hemophilia is recessive, so for a male to have it, he just needs one X with the recessive allele. So the mother must have given her Xh to the son. So the mother must be XHXh because she's a carrier. The father is XY, but his X must be normal because he doesn't have hemophilia.

So when they have children, each child gets an X from the mother and either X or Y from the father.

So for daughters: they get X from father and X from mother. The father can only give X or Y. Wait, no, wait, the father gives X to daughters and Y to sons. So for daughters, the X comes from the father (which is normal, X) and one from the mother, which could be X or Xh.

The mother has XHXh, so each of her gametes has a 50% chance of being X or Xh. The father's gametes are either X (from his X) or Y (for sons). So daughters get X from father and X from mother.

Wait, no, no. Wait, the father's gametes that result in daughters are the X ones, and for sons, it's Y. So the father contributes X or Y. Wait, no, the father's X is normal because he's phenotypically normal. So the father's gametes are X (normal) or Y.

So when the mother has XHXh and the father is XY (but his X is normal), each child's possible combinations:

- Sons: get X from mother and Y from father. Wait, no, sons get X from mother and Y from father. No, wait, sons get Y from father and X from mother. Wait, no, sons get X from mother and Y from father, so their X determines if they have hemophilia. Wait, no, sons get X from mother and Y from father. So the X comes from mother, and if it's Xh, the son has hemophilia.

Daughters get X from father and X from mother. So the X from father is normal (since he's XXY? No, wait, father is XY, so he gives X or Y. No, wait, noâ€”daughters get X from father and X from mother. Wait, no, daughters get X from father (which is X) and X from mother. Wait, no, the father's gamete for daughters is X, and for sons is Y. So the father's X is normal, so daughters get X (normal) from father and either X or Xh from mother.

So the mother's gametes: 50% X, 50% Xh.

So for daughters: 50% chance of getting X from mother and 50% of Xh from mother, but paired with the father's X (which is normal). So the daughter's possible genotypes are:

- X (from father) + X (from mother): XHX, which is normal.

- X (father) + Xh (mother): XHXh, which is carrier.

So the daughter can't have hemophilia because hemophilia is recessive and requires two Xh alleles. Since the father gives a normal X, the daughter can only have XHX or XHXh. So she can't have hemophilia because she needs two Xh.

Wait, but the question is about the next child being a girl. So what's the chance that the girl has hemophilia? Since hemophilia is recessive and the girl needs two Xh alleles, but the father can't contribute Xh (he's normal, so his X is X), the daughter can't have hemophilia. Because the daughter gets X from father and either X or Xh from mother. So the daughter can be XHX (normal) or XHXh (carrier), but never XhXh.

So the probability that a girl has hemophilia is zero.

Wait, but let me double-check. The mother is XHXh. The father is XY, with X being normal. So when they have a daughter, the daughter gets X from father and X from mother. So possible combinations:

- X (father) + X (mother): XHX, normal.

- X (father) + Xh (mother): XHXh, carrier.

So the daughter can't have hemophilia because she needs two Xh, but the father only gives X. So the chance is zero.

So the answer should be G: No chance.
</think>

The couple is phenotypically normal, meaning neither parent shows signs of hemophilia. Hemophilia is a recessive sex-linked disorder carried on the X chromosome. Since the couple had a son with hemophilia, the mother must be a carrier (genotype XHXh), as she passed the Xh allele to her son. The father must have a normal X (XH) and a Y chromosome (XY).

For their next child, if it is a daughter, she will inherit one X chromosome from the father (which is normal, XH) and one X chromosome from the mother (which has a 50% chance of being XH or Xh). Therefore, the daughter can either be XHX (normal) or XHXh (carrier). Hemophilia requires two Xh alleles, which is impossible in this case since the father only provides a normal X chromosome. Thus, the probability that their next child, if a girl, would have hemophilia is **0%**.
