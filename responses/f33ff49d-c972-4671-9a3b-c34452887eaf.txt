Okay, so I need to subtract 1,709 from 2,396. Hmm, let me think about how to do this step by step. I remember that subtraction can sometimes be tricky, especially with larger numbers, so I should take it one digit at a time.

First, I'll write down the numbers to make it easier:

  2,396
- 1,709
________

Starting from the rightmost digit, which is the ones place. I have 6 minus 9. Oh wait, 6 is smaller than 9, so I can't subtract 9 from 6 directly. I think I need to borrow from the next higher place, which is the tens place.

Looking at the tens place, there's a 9. I'll borrow 1 from the 9, making it 8, and add 10 to the 6 in the ones place. So now, the ones place becomes 16, and the tens place is 8.

Now, subtracting the ones place: 16 - 9 = 7.

Next, moving to the tens place: 8 - 0. Wait, the bottom number has a 0 in the tens place, so it's just 8 - 0 = 8.

Moving on to the hundreds place: 3 (from 2,396) minus 7 (from 1,709). Again, 3 is less than 7, so I need to borrow from the thousands place. The 2 in the thousands place will become 1, and the 3 in the hundreds place becomes 13.

Now, subtracting the hundreds place: 13 - 7 = 6.

Finally, the thousands place: 1 (since we borrowed earlier) minus 1 = 0. But since we don't need to write the leading zero, the result is just the digits we've calculated.

Putting it all together, the digits we've got are 6 in the hundreds, 8 in the tens, and 7 in the ones. Wait, that would make 687. Let me check that again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me try adding 1,709 to 687 to see if I get 2,396. 1,709 + 687: 1,700 + 600 is 2,300, and 9 + 87 is 96, so total is 2,396. Yep, that adds up correctly. So the answer should be 687, which is option C.

The result of 2,396 minus 1,709 is 687.
