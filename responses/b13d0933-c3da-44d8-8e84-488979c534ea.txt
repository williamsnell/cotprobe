Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is asking for the ones digit of the product of numbers from 1 to 9. That is, 1 multiplied by 2, then 3, all the way up to 9. So, the product is 1×2×3×4×5×6×7×8×9. I need to find the last digit of this product. 

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with the ones digit of a product, I don't need to calculate the entire product. Instead, I can just focus on the ones digits of each number as I multiply them step by step. That should simplify things a bit because I can keep track of just the last digit after each multiplication, which makes the numbers easier to handle.

Let me start by writing down each multiplication step and noting the ones digit after each step. 

1. First, I'll multiply 1 and 2. 1×2 is 2. The ones digit is 2.
2. Next, I'll multiply that result by 3. So, 2×3 is 6. The ones digit is now 6.
3. Then, I'll multiply by 4. 6×4 equals 24. The ones digit here is 4.
4. Now, multiply by 5. 4×5 is 20. So, the ones digit is 0.
5. Moving on to 6. I'll multiply 0 by 6, which is 0. The ones digit remains 0.
6. Next, multiply by 7. 0×7 is still 0. Ones digit stays 0.
7. Then, multiply by 8. 0×8 is 0. Still 0.
8. Finally, multiply by 9. 0×9 is 0. Ones digit is 0.

Wait a minute, so after multiplying by 5, the ones digit became 0, and since any number multiplied by 0 is 0, all subsequent multiplications will keep the ones digit as 0. That makes sense because once you have a factor of 10 in the product (which happens when you multiply 5 and 2), the ones digit becomes 0 and stays that way.

So, putting it all together, the product of numbers from 1 to 9 is 362880, but I don't need the whole number. I just need the ones digit. From my step-by-step multiplication, after the fifth step, the ones digit is 0, and it doesn't change after that. Therefore, the ones digit of the entire product is 0.

Looking back at the options given:
A: 9
B: 8
C: 0
D: 1
E: 6
F: 5
G: 3
H: 2
I: 4
J: 7

Option C is 0, which matches my conclusion. So, the correct answer must be C.

The ones digit of the product is 0 because once a factor of 10 is introduced (from 2×5), the ones digit remains 0.

Answer: C
