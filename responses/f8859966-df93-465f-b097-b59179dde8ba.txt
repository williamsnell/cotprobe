Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about finding the wavelength of middle C in air when its frequency is given as 256 sec^-1. Hmm, I remember that wave problems often involve the speed, frequency, and wavelength relationship. Oh right, the formula is speed equals frequency multiplied by wavelength, or v = f位. So I need to find the wavelength, which would be 位 = v/f.

Wait, but what's the speed of sound in air? I think it's a standard value. From what I recall, the speed of sound in air at room temperature is approximately 343 meters per second. But wait, I'm not sure if that's exact. Maybe it's 340 m/s for simplicity sometimes. I should check if the problem gives any specific value, but it doesn't, so I'll go with the commonly used 340 m/s.

So, the frequency (f) is 256 Hz, right? Because 1 sec^-1 is 1 Hz. So f = 256 Hz. Now, using the formula 位 = v/f. Plugging in the numbers: 位 = 340 m/s divided by 256 Hz. Let me calculate that.

340 divided by 256. Let me see, 256 times 1 is 256, 256 times 1.3 is about 332.8, because 256 *1 =256, 256 *0.3=76.8, so 256 +76.8=332.8. Hmm, 340 is a bit more than that. So 340 -332.8 =7.2. So that's 1.3 plus 7.2/256. Wait, 7.2 divided by 256 is approximately 0.028. So total would be around 1.328 meters. Wait, but that's in meters, so I should convert that to centimeters because the options are in cm. 1.328 meters is 132.8 centimeters. 

Looking at the options, option B is 133 cm, which is very close. So that should be the answer. Let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 340 /256: let me do it more accurately. 256 goes into 340 once, with 84 left. 840 divided by 256 is about 3.28125. So 1.328125 meters, which is 132.8125 cm. Yep, rounds to 133 cm. So the answer should be B.

The wavelength of middle C can be calculated using the formula \( \lambda = \frac{v}{f} \), where \( v \) is the speed of sound in air (approximately 340 m/s) and \( f \) is the frequency (256 Hz). Substituting the values, \( \lambda = \frac{340}{256} \approx 1.328 \) meters, which is approximately 133 cm. 

Answer: B
