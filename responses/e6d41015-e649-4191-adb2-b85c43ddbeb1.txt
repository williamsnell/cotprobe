Okay, so I've got this logic question here about identifying the antecedent in a conditional proposition. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my logic terms, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The proposition is: "The university raises tuition only if both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it." So, I need to break this down into its logical components.

First, I remember that in logic, a conditional statement is usually in the form "If A, then B." But this statement seems a bit different because it's phrased as "only if." I think "only if" indicates that B is a necessary condition for A. So, the structure would be: A only if B, which translates to A → B. So, A is the antecedent, and B is the consequent.

Wait, but in this case, the proposition is that the university raises tuition only if both the governor approves and the board recommends. So, let me assign variables to make it clearer. Let me say:

Let R = The university raises tuition.
G = The governor approves of it.
B = The board of trustees recommends it.

So the statement is: R only if (G and B). In logical terms, that's R → (G ∧ B). So the antecedent here is R, right? Because the structure is "If R, then (G and B)." Wait, no, I think I might be getting this mixed up. Wait, no, the statement is saying that R can only happen if both G and B are true. So, R is only possible if both G and B are true. So, the conditional is R → (G ∧ B). So the antecedent is R, and the consequent is (G ∧ B).

Wait, but the question is asking for the antecedent of the conditional proposition. So the antecedent is R, which is "The university raises tuition." So looking at the options, I need to find which option corresponds to R.

Looking at the options, option H is "The university does not raise tuition." Wait, no, H is "The university raises tuition." Wait, let me check:

Options:

A: The board of trustees does not recommend it.
B: The governor approves of it.
C: The board of trustees recommends it.
D: The governor disapproves of it and the board of trustees does not recommend it.
E: The governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it.
F: The university does not raise tuition.
G: Both the governor and the board of trustees do not approve of it.
H: The university raises tuition.
I: The governor disapproves of it.
J: The governor approves of it or the board of trustees recommends it.

So, R is "The university raises tuition," which is option H. Therefore, the antecedent is H.

Wait, but wait a second. I'm a bit confused because sometimes "only if" can be tricky. Let me think again. The original statement is "R only if (G and B)." That translates to R → (G ∧ B). So the antecedent is R, which is H.

But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes people mistake the consequent for the antecedent. Let me make sure. In a conditional statement "If A, then B," A is the antecedent and B is the consequent. So in this case, since it's "R only if (G and B)," that's equivalent to saying "If R, then (G and B)." So the antecedent is R, which is H.

Alternatively, I could also think of it as "R can't happen unless both G and B happen." So R is dependent on G and B. So the antecedent is R.

Therefore, the correct answer should be H.

The antecedent of the conditional proposition is "The university raises tuition," which corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
