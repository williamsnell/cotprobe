Okay, so I have this question about Anscombe criticizing Kant's ideas. I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy, but let me try to think this through.

First, the question is asking which of Kant's ideas Anscombe criticizes as absurd. The options are A to J, each corresponding to a different Kantian concept.

I remember that G.E.M. Anscombe was a 20th-century philosopher who wrote a lot about ethics and Kant. I think she was critical of Kant's deontological ethics. But what specific idea was she against?

Looking at the options:

A: Postulate of immortality. I think Kant did talk about immortality in his moral philosophy, but was Anscombe particularly critical of that? Not sure.

B: Autonomous will. That's a key Kantian concept. Kant says the will is autonomous, meaning it's governed by moral law, not desires. Anscombe might have had something to say about this, but I'm not certain if she called it absurd.

C: Categorical imperative. That's Kant's central moral principle. The idea that you should act according to maxims that could be universal laws. I don't recall Anscombe calling this absurd, though she might have had critiques.

D: Legislating for oneself. That sounds like autonomy again. Because Kant says we make the moral law for ourselves. Maybe Anscombe thought this was problematic, but I'm not sure if she labeled it absurd.

E: Unity of consciousness. That seems more like a metaphysical concept, maybe related to the mind. Not sure if Anscombe tackled this specifically.

F: Transcendental unity of apperception. That's a Kantian term about how the mind organizes experience. I don't think Anscombe focused much on this.

G: Phenomenal self. This is the self as we experience it, opposed to the noumenal self. I don't recall her criticisms here.

H: Thing in itself. Kant's distinction between phenomena (appearance) and noumena (things in themselves). Anscombe might have discussed this, but I don't think it's the main point of her criticism.

I: Noumenal self. This is the self as a thing in itself, separate from our experience. I think Anscombe was critical of this concept, arguing that it's not necessary for ethics. She might have said that the idea of a noumenal self is absurd because it's not needed to explain moral responsibility.

J: Kingdom of ends. Kant talks about the idea of acting as if the world were a kingdom of rational beings. I don't think Anscombe focused on this as the target of her criticism.

Wait, I think I remember something about Anscombe and the categorical imperative. She argued that the CI is not a good candidate for a moral principle because it doesn't provide practical guidance in specific situations. But does she call it absurd? Or did she find it insufficient?

Alternatively, I think she was critical of the idea of the autonomous will, arguing that it's not a good basis for morality because it can lead to moral dilemmas where duties conflict. But I'm not sure if she called it absurd.

Wait, another thought: Anscombe's essay "Causality and Determinism" might have some relevance here. She critiques the notion of the will as a cause, but I'm not certain if that's the same as the idea being absurd.

Alternatively, in her "Intention," she critiques Kant's idea of the will as a separate faculty. Maybe she found the idea of the will legislating for oneself as absurd because it implies a kind of separation that doesn't make sense.

Looking back at the options, D is "legislating for oneself," which aligns with the idea of autonomy. If she thought that was a flawed concept, perhaps she called it absurd.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. I think the main target of her criticism was the idea of the will as a faculty that can立法 for oneself, which she might have seen as problematic.

Alternatively, maybe it's option B: the autonomous will. But I'm not sure if she called it absurd.

Alternatively, perhaps she criticized the idea of the kingdom of ends as being too idealistic.

Wait, I think I need to recall more precisely. Anscombe's main criticism of Kant was regarding the basis of morality. She argued that the idea of the categorical imperative is not a good foundation because it doesn't account for human nature and the possibility of conflicting duties. But she didn't necessarily call it absurd, just flawed.

Wait, another angle: Anscombe wrote "Kant's Ethics of Practical Reason: A Response" or something like that. She might have said that Kant's idea of the will legislating for itself is incoherent or absurd because it suggests that we create our own moral laws, which could be arbitrary or conflicting.

So, perhaps the answer is D: legislating for oneself.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe it's the postulate of immortality, but I don't think so. Or the noumenal self.

Wait, another thought: In her work, Anscombe was critical of the dualism in Kant's philosophy, particularly the distinction between the phenomenal and noumenal worlds. She might have found the noumenal self (I) to be an unnecessary concept and perhaps absurd.

But I'm not sure if that's the specific target of her criticism regarding absurdity.

Alternatively, she might have found the idea of the will being autonomous as absurd because it implies that we can create our own moral laws without any foundation, leading to moral relativism.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think of the options again. The question says Anscombe criticizes as absurd. Which of these was Kant's idea that she deemed absurd.

Wait, I think I remember that Anscombe argued that the concept of the will as a faculty that legislates for itself is incoherent because it implies that the will is both the legislator and the subject of the law, which is a contradiction. So she might have seen this as absurd.

If that's the case, then the answer would be B: the autonomous will.

But another angle: She might have been critical of the idea of the kingdom of ends, thinking it's too abstract or idealistic. But I'm not sure.

Wait, a more precise memory: In her essay "Kant's Intuitionalism," Anscombe criticizes Kant's notion of the moral law as something that the will legislates for itself. She argues that this is a confused way of putting it because it suggests the will is both the source of the law and bound by it, which is contradictory. So she finds this idea absurd.

So, the idea is that the will is autonomous, meaning it's the source of moral law, but that leads to a paradox because the will would then have to obey its own laws, which are self-made. She might have seen this as an incoherent or absurd position.

Therefore, the answer would be B: the autonomous will.

Wait, but the options are A to J. Let me check:

B is the autonomous will.

Alternatively, maybe she's criticizing the idea of legislating for oneself, which is D. Because if the will is legislating for oneself, that's the same as autonomy.

So perhaps the answer is D.

Wait, but the question is about what Anscombe criticizes as absurd. I think she focused more on the notion of the will's autonomy as leading to a paradox, so perhaps option B.

But I'm a bit confused. Another approach: looking up (mentally) what Anscombe's main criticisms of Kant were. She argued that Kant's deontological ethics is flawed because it doesn't provide a plausible basis for moral motivation. She also thought that the idea of the will being autonomous was not a good foundation because it leads to problems with conflicting duties and the possibility of acting against one's own laws.

Wait, but the question is about what she called absurd. Maybe she didn't use "absurd" for the autonomous will but for another concept.

Alternatively, perhaps she found the idea of the kingdom of ends (J) to be absurd because it's an ideal that can't be realized.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the postulate of immortality (A) is what she found absurd, but I don't recall that.

Wait, I think I remember that Anscombe was critical of the idea that the will is a separate faculty that can立法 for oneself. She might have seen this as an incoherent idea because it implies the will can make laws without any foundation, leading to moral contradictions.

So, that would point to D: legislating for oneself.

But I'm still not 100% certain. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C: the categorical imperative.

Wait, but I think the categorical imperative is the central idea, and she had issues with it, but she didn't call it absurd.

Hmm. Maybe I should go with D: legislating for oneself, as that seems to align with her criticism of autonomy and the paradoxes it creates.
</think>

Anscombe criticizes Kant's idea of the will legislating for oneself as absurd because it implies a paradox where the will is both the source of moral law and bound by it, leading to incoherence. 

Answer: D
