Okay, so I have this problem to find the inverse Laplace transform of log[(s + 1)/(s - 1)] where s > 1. Hmm, I remember that Laplace transforms often involve converting functions from the time domain to the complex frequency domain, and the inverse would do the opposite. But I'm a bit rusty on the exact methods for finding inverse Laplace transforms, especially for logarithmic functions.

First, I recall that Laplace transforms have some standard forms and properties. Maybe I can express the logarithm in a way that relates to known transforms. The argument inside the log is (s+1)/(s-1). Let me see if I can rewrite that expression to make it more manageable. 

Wait, log(a/b) is equal to log(a) - log(b), so I can split the log into log(s+1) minus log(s-1). So, L^{-1} { log[(s+1)/(s-1)] } = L^{-1} { log(s+1) } - L^{-1} { log(s-1) }. That might make things easier because perhaps I can find the inverse of each term separately.

Now, I need to remember if there are standard inverse Laplace transforms for functions involving log(s). I don't think I've encountered that before, so maybe I should think about differentiation under the transform. I remember that differentiation in the s-domain corresponds to multiplication by t in the time domain. So, if I can relate log(s+1) or log(s-1) to derivatives of other functions, perhaps I can find the inverse.

Let me consider F(s) = log(s + a), where a is a constant. I don't know the inverse of that off the top of my head, but maybe I can take the derivative of F(s) with respect to s. The derivative of log(s + a) with respect to s is 1/(s + a). The inverse Laplace transform of 1/(s + a) is e^{-a t}. So, if I can relate the derivative to a known transform, maybe I can integrate to find the inverse.

But wait, the inverse Laplace transform is linear, so if I have L^{-1} {dF/ds} = L^{-1} {1/(s + a)} = e^{-a t}, then F(s) would be the integral of this with respect to s. Hmm, but integrating in the s-domain usually involves convolution in the time domain. Alternatively, maybe I can express log(s + a) as an integral of 1/(s + a). 

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can use the property that L^{-1} {∫_{c}^{s} F(u) du} = ∫_{0}^{t} f(τ) dτ. So if I can express log(s + a) as an integral from some point to s of 1/(u + a) du, then maybe I can find the inverse.

Let me try that. The integral of 1/(u + a) du from, say, a to s would be log(s + a) - log(a). So, log(s + a) = ∫_{a}^{s} [1/(u + a)] du. Therefore, L^{-1} {log(s + a)} would be ∫_{0}^{t} L^{-1} {1/(u + a)} du. But wait, no, that's not quite right because the integral is with respect to u in the s-domain, which translates to convolution in the time domain.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. The inverse Laplace transform of log(s + a) might be related to the integral of e^{-a t} dt, but since log(s + a) is the integral of 1/(s + a), maybe the inverse is the integral of e^{-a t} from 0 to t, which is (1 - e^{-a t}) / a.

Wait, let me check that. If I integrate e^{-a t} from 0 to t, I get ∫0 to t e^{-a τ} dτ = [(-1/a)e^{-a τ}] from 0 to t = (-1/a)(e^{-a t} - 1) = (1 - e^{-a t})/a. So if log(s + a) is the integral of 1/(s + a) ds from some point, then its inverse would be the integral of e^{-a t} dt, which is (1 - e^{-a t})/a. So, perhaps L^{-1} {log(s + a)} = (1 - e^{-a t})/(a t) ? Wait, no, that doesn't match the integral I just did. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me think about differentiation. If I take the Laplace transform of t f(t), it's -F'(s). So, if F(s) = L{f(t)}, then L{t f(t)} = -F'(s). So, inverting F'(s) would give me -t f(t). But I need to go the other way. Suppose I have F(s) = log(s + a). Then F'(s) = 1/(s + a), whose inverse is e^{-a t}. So, L^{-1} {F'(s)} = e^{-a t} = - t L^{-1} {F(s)}. Wait, that can't be right. Let me rephrase.

We know that L{f(t)} = F(s). Then L{t f(t)} = -F'(s). So, if I have F'(s), then L^{-1} {F'(s)} = -t f(t). So, if F(s) = log(s + a), then F'(s) = 1/(s + a), whose inverse is e^{-a t}. Therefore, L^{-1} {1/(s + a)} = e^{-a t} = -t f(t). So, solving for f(t), we get f(t) = -e^{-a t} / t. But wait, that would mean L^{-1} {log(s + a)} = f(t) = -e^{-a t} / t. But that can't be right because log(s + a) has a branch point and the inverse would have a t in the denominator, which might be correct. Let me check with a=1.

Wait, let's take a=1. Then log(s + 1) would have an inverse of -e^{-t}/t. But I'm not sure if that's correct because I don't recall the exact inverse. Alternatively, maybe I can look up standard inverses. Wait, perhaps another method would be better.

Alternatively, I can use partial fractions or known integral transforms. Let me consider expanding log[(s+1)/(s-1)] as log(s+1) - log(s-1). So, f(t) = L^{-1} {log(s+1)} - L^{-1} {log(s-1)}. If I can find each of these, then I can subtract them to get the answer.

Suppose I denote F1(s) = log(s+1) and F2(s) = log(s-1). Then, as before, F1'(s) = 1/(s+1) and F2'(s) = 1/(s-1). The inverses of these are e^{-t} and e^{t}, respectively. But since L^{-1} {F'(s)} = -t f(t), then f(t) would be -e^{-t}/t for F1(s) and -e^{t}/t for F2(s). Therefore, L^{-1} {log(s+1)} = -e^{-t}/t and L^{-1} {log(s-1)} = -e^{t}/t.

Wait, but that would give f(t) = (-e^{-t}/t) - (-e^{t}/t) = (-e^{-t} + e^{t})/t. Simplifying, that's (e^{t} - e^{-t})/(t). But e^{t} - e^{-t} is 2 sinh(t), so f(t) = 2 sinh(t)/t. Looking at the options, option B is (2 sinh t)/t^2 and option D is (2 sinh t)/t. So, I think I got 2 sinh t over t, which would be option D. But wait, let me make sure.

Wait, let me double-check the signs. If F1(s) = log(s+1), then F1'(s) = 1/(s+1). The inverse of 1/(s+1) is e^{-t}. But L{t f(t)} = -F'(s), so e^{-t} = - t f(t) => f(t) = -e^{-t}/t. Similarly, F2(s)=log(s-1), F2'(s)=1/(s-1), inverse is e^{t}, so f(t) = -e^{t}/t. Thus, L^{-1}{F1} = -e^{-t}/t and L^{-1}{F2} = -e^{t}/t. So, the original function is F1 - F2 = (-e^{-t}/t) - (-e^{t}/t) = (-e^{-t} + e^{t})/t = (e^{t} - e^{-t})/t = 2 sinh t / t, which is option D.

Wait, but I thought earlier that the inverse of log(s+a) is (1 - e^{-a t})/(a t), but that doesn't match what I just did. I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify: the correct approach is to realize that F'(s) = 1/(s+a), inverse is e^{-a t}, and then F(s) = log(s+a) = ∫_{c}^{s} [1/(u+a)] du, so the inverse is ∫_{0}^{t} e^{-a τ} dτ / a? Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the integral representation. Let me consider that log(s + a) can be written as the integral from some point to s of 1/(u + a) du. Then, the inverse Laplace transform of that integral would be the convolution of the inverse transforms. But I'm not sure if that's the right path.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me recall that the Laplace transform of (1 - e^{-a t})/a is (1/(s)) - (1/(s + a)) = (a)/(s(s + a)). Wait, that's not directly helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can express log(s + a) as an integral involving 1/(s + a). 

Alternatively, perhaps I can use integration in the s-domain. The inverse Laplace transform of log(s + a) would be the integral from 0 to t of e^{-a τ} dτ divided by a, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, let's compute it properly.

If F(s) = log(s + a), then F'(s) = 1/(s + a), which has inverse e^{-a t}. So, L^{-1} {F'(s)} = e^{-a t}, which equals -d/dt L^{-1} {F(s)}. Wait, no, because L{f(t)} = F(s), then L{t f(t)} = -F'(s). So, F'(s) = - L{t f(t)}. Therefore, e^{-a t} = - t f(t). Solving for f(t), f(t) = -e^{-a t}/t. So, L^{-1} {log(s + a)} = -e^{-a t}/t.

Similarly, for log(s - a), it would be -e^{a t}/t. So, putting it all together, the original function is log[(s+1)/(s-1)] = log(s+1) - log(s-1), so the inverse transform is [ -e^{-t}/t ] - [ -e^{t}/t ] = (-e^{-t} + e^{t})/t = (e^{t} - e^{-t})/t, which is 2 sinh(t)/t. So that's option D.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option D is (2 sinh t)/t, which matches what I got. So the answer should be D.

To find the inverse Laplace transform of \( \log\left(\frac{s + 1}{s - 1}\right) \) for \( s > 1 \), we can decompose the logarithm into \( \log(s + 1) - \log(s - 1) \). Using the property that the inverse Laplace transform of \( \log(s + a) \) is \( -\frac{e^{-a t}}{t} \), we compute:

\[
\mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{\log(s + 1)\right\} = -\frac{e^{-t}}{t}, \quad \mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{\log(s - 1)\right\} = -\frac{e^{t}}{t}.
\]

Subtracting these results gives:

\[
\mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{\log\left(\frac{s + 1}{s - 1}\right)\right\} = -\frac{e^{-t}}{t} - \left(-\frac{e^{t}}{t}\right) = \frac{e^{t} - e^{-t}}{t} = \frac{2 \sinh(t)}{t}.
\]

Thus, the inverse Laplace transform is \( \frac{2 \sinh(t)}{t} \), which corresponds to option D.
