Okay, so I've got this question about estimating the collisional cross section of CO₂ given its diffusion coefficient. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, I remember that the diffusion coefficient (D) is related to the collisional properties of molecules. There's a formula that connects D with the mean free path or something like that. Wait, I think it's the Chapman-Enskog theory that provides a way to calculate the diffusion coefficient based on molecular properties.

The formula I vaguely recall involves the diffusion coefficient, the collisional cross section (σ), the temperature, and maybe the molar mass. Let me try to jot down the formula. I think it's something like D = (1/3) * (λ), where λ is the mean free path. But wait, that might not be the exact formula. Alternatively, I remember that the mean free path λ is related to the collisional cross section and the concentration of molecules.

Another approach: the diffusion coefficient D can be expressed using the formula D = (3/8) * (k*T)/(π*d²*N_A), but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, maybe I should look for a formula that directly relates D to the collisional cross section σ.

Oh right! The collisional cross section σ is related to the diffusion coefficient by the formula D = (σ² * N_A * sqrt(π * k*T)) / (3 * (2π * m * k*T)^(1/2)) ), but that seems complicated. Alternatively, I think there's a simpler relation where D is proportional to σ², but I can't remember the exact expression.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the mean free path. The mean free path λ is given by λ = 1/(√2 * n * σ), where n is the number density. And the diffusion coefficient D is approximately (1/3) * λ * v_avg, where v_avg is the average velocity.

The average velocity v_avg can be calculated using the formula v_avg = sqrt(8*k*T/(π*m)), where m is the mass of a molecule. Putting it all together, D = (1/3) * (1/(√2 * n * σ)) * sqrt(8*k*T/(π*m)).

But n, the number density, is equal to P/(k*T), right? Since n = P/(k*T) from the ideal gas law. So substituting n into the equation, D = (1/3) * (k*T/P)^(1/2) * sqrt(8*k*T/(π*m)) ) / (√2 * σ).

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe there's a more straightforward formula. Oh, I think the formula that relates D and σ is D = (σ² * sqrt(π) * N_A * k*T) / (8 * m * (2π)^(3/2) * T^(3/2)) ), but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, I remember that D can be approximated using the formula D = (σ² * sqrt(k*T)) / (3 * (2π*m)^(1/2)) ). Let me check the units to see if that makes sense. D has units of m²/s. σ is in m², so σ² would be m^4. sqrt(k*T) is sqrt(J/(mol*K) * K) = sqrt(J/mol) which is m²/s², but wait, no, k is Boltzmann constant, so k*T has units of energy. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me get the units right. k is Boltzmann's constant, which is 1.38e-23 J/K. So k*T at 273 K would be about 1.38e-23 * 273 ≈ 3.77e-21 J. sqrt(k*T) would be sqrt(3.77e-21) ≈ 6.14e-11 J^(1/2), but I'm not sure how that helps.

Wait, maybe I should look for a formula that directly relates D and σ, perhaps from the Chapman-Enskog theory. From what I recall, the formula for the diffusion coefficient in the Chapman-Enskog theory for gases is given by:

D = ( (3/8) * (k*T) / (π * m) )^(1/2) * ( σ² / (n) )

But wait, n is number density, which is P/(k*T). So substituting that in, D = (sqrt(3/(8 π m)) * sqrt(k T)) ) * (σ² * k T / P )

Hmm, perhaps that's a way to approach it. Let me write down the variables:

Given:
D = 1.00e-5 m²/s
T = 273 K
P = 1 atm = 101325 Pa

We need to find σ, the collisional cross section in nm².

First, I need to express the formula for D in terms of σ. Let me try to rearrange.

From the formula:

D = ( (3/8 π m )^(-1/2) ) * (σ² n) / (2)

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the simplified formula for D in terms of σ, m, T, and P.

I found online (but since I can't access, I'm recalling) that D = ( (3/8 π m )^(1/2) ) * (σ² n) * sqrt(T) )

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, a better approach is to use the formula:

D = ( (3/8) * (k*T) )^(1/2) * (σ² / ( (2 π m )^(1/2) )) ) / (n )

But n = P/(k*T), so substituting:

D = ( (3/8 k T )^(1/2) ) * (σ²) / ( (2 π m )^(1/2) ) ) * (k T / P )

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula from the Chapman-Enskog theory which states:

D = ( (3/8) (k T) / (π m) )^(1/2) ) * ( σ² / ( sqrt(2) * n ) )

But n = P/(k T), so:

D = ( (3/(8 π m))^(1/2) ) * sqrt(k T) ) * ( σ² * sqrt(k T) ) / ( sqrt(2) P )

Hmm, this is getting a bit messy. Maybe I should look for a direct formula that expresses σ in terms of D, T, m, and P.

Alternatively, I think the formula can be written as:

σ² = ( D * 8 * m * (k T)^(3/2) ) / (3 * (π) * P )

Wait, let me try to derive it step by step.

We know that the mean free path λ = 1/(√2 n σ) = (k T)/(P σ √2 )

And D = (1/3) λ v_avg, where v_avg = sqrt(8 k T/(π m)).

So substituting:

D = (1/3) * (k T)/(P σ √2 ) * sqrt(8 k T/(π m)).

Let me simplify this expression.

First, expand the terms:

D = (1/3) * (k T) / (P σ √2) * sqrt(8 k T/(π m)).

Multiply the terms:

= (1/3) * (k T) / (P σ √2) * sqrt(8) sqrt(k T) / sqrt(π m).

Simplify sqrt(8) = 2√2.

So:

= (1/3) * (k T) / (P σ √2) * (2√2) sqrt(k T) / sqrt(π m).

The √2 in the denominator cancels with the 2√2 in the numerator:

= (1/3) * (k T) * 2√2 / (√2) * sqrt(k T) / (P σ sqrt(π m)).

Simplify 2√2 / √2 = 2.

So:

= (1/3) * 2 * (k T) * sqrt(k T) / (P σ sqrt(π m)).

= (2/(3)) * (k T)^(3/2) / (P σ sqrt(π m)).

Rearranging to solve for σ²:

Wait, let me re-express the equation:

D = (2/(3)) * (k T)^(3/2) / (P σ sqrt(π m)).

Let's solve for σ:

σ = (2/(3 D)) * (k T)^(3/2) / (P sqrt(π m)).

But wait, that gives σ in terms of D, but I'm looking for σ. Alternatively, I can square both sides to get σ².

Wait, let me rearrange the equation to solve for σ:

σ = [ (2/(3 D)) * (k T)^(3/2) ] / (P sqrt(π m)).

But maybe it's easier to square both sides to get σ², but perhaps I can rearrange it differently.

Alternatively, let's rearrange the equation:

σ = [ (2/(3)) * (k T)^(3/2) ) ] / ( D P sqrt(π m) )

But I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me double-check the steps.

Wait, the initial equation was:

D = (2/(3)) * (k T)^(3/2) / (P σ sqrt(π m)).

So, rearranging for σ:

σ = (2/(3 D)) * (k T)^(3/2) ) / ( P sqrt(π m) )

Wait, that seems correct. Now, let's plug in the known values.

First, compute each part:

k = Boltzmann's constant = 1.380649e-23 J/K.

T = 273 K.

m = mass of CO₂. CO₂ has a molar mass of 44 g/mol, so m = (44e-3 kg/mol) / (Avogadro's number) = 44e-3 / 6.022e23 ≈ 7.307e-26 kg.

Wait, let me compute that accurately.

Molar mass of CO₂: C is 12 g/mol, O is 16 g/mol each, so 12 + 2*16 = 44 g/mol = 0.044 kg/mol.

So m = 0.044 kg/mol / 6.022e23 mol⁻¹ = 0.044 / 6.022e23 kg.

Calculating that: 0.044 / 6.022e23 = approx 7.307e-26 kg.

Now, compute (k T)^(3/2):

k*T = 1.38e-23 J/K * 273 K ≈ 3.7674e-21 J.

(k*T)^(3/2) = (3.7674e-21)^(3/2) = sqrt(3.7674e-21)^3.

sqrt(3.7674e-21) ≈ 6.137e-11 J^(1/2).

Cubing that: (6.137e-11)^3 ≈ 2.326e-32 (J^(3/2)).

Wait, but J is kg·m²/s², so J^(3/2) is kg^(3/2) m^3 s^{-3}.

But perhaps it's better to compute numerically:

Compute (3.7674e-21)^(1.5) = e^{1.5 * ln(3.7674e-21)}.

ln(3.7674e-21) ≈ ln(3.7674) + ln(1e-21) ≈ 1.326 + (-46.0517) ≈ -44.725.

Multiply by 1.5: -67.088.

e^{-67.088} is a very small number, but perhaps I should use a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute (k*T)^(3/2) as (k*T) * sqrt(k*T).

So (3.7674e-21) * sqrt(3.7674e-21) = 3.7674e-21 * 6.137e-11 ≈ 2.313e-31.

Wait, wait, 3.7674e-21 * 6.137e-11 = (3.7674 * 6.137) e-32 ≈ 23.13e-32 ≈ 2.313e-31.

Hmm, that's more manageable.

Now, compute the numerator: 2/(3 D) * (k T)^(3/2) = (2/(3 * 1e-5)) ) * 2.313e-31.

Wait, D is 1.00e-5 m²/s.

So 2/(3 * 1e-5) = 2/(3e-5) ≈ 6.6667e4.

Multiply by 2.313e-31: 6.6667e4 * 2.313e-31 ≈ 1.542e-26.

Now, compute the denominator: P * sqrt(π m).

P is 1 atm = 101325 Pa.

sqrt(π m) = sqrt(3.1416 * 7.307e-26 kg) ≈ sqrt(2.300e-25) ≈ 4.796e-13 kg^(1/2).

So denominator = 101325 * 4.796e-13 ≈ 101325 * 4.796e-13.

Calculating that: 101325 ≈ 1.01325e5.

So 1.01325e5 * 4.796e-13 ≈ (1.01325 * 4.796) e-8 ≈ 4.863e-8.

Now, σ = numerator / denominator = 1.542e-26 / 4.863e-8 ≈ 3.172e-19 m².

Wait, that's 3.172e-19 m². But we need to convert that to nm².

1 m² = 1e18 nm², so 3.172e-19 m² = 3.172e-19 * 1e18 = 3.172e-1 nm² ≈ 0.3172 nm².

Looking at the options, option E is 0.318 nm², which is very close to this value.

To estimate the collisional cross section (σ) of CO₂ given its diffusion coefficient (D), we use the relationship derived from the Chapman-Enskog theory:

\[
D = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{(kT)^{3/2}}{P \cdot \sigma \cdot \sqrt{\pi m}}
\]

Rearranging for σ:

\[
\sigma = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{(kT)^{3/2}}{D \cdot P \cdot \sqrt{\pi m}}
\]

### Step 1: Known values
- \( D = 1.00 \times 10^{-5} \, \mathrm{m}^2 \mathrm{s}^{-1} \)
- \( T = 273 \, \mathrm{K} \)
- \( P = 1 \, \mathrm{atm} = 101325 \, \mathrm{Pa} \)
- Boltzmann constant \( k = 1.380649 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{J/K} \)
- Molar mass of CO₂ = \( 44 \, \mathrm{g/mol} = 0.044 \, \mathrm{kg/mol} \)
- Avogadro's number \( N_A = 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \mathrm{mol}^{-1} \)

The mass of a single CO₂ molecule is:

\[
m = \frac{0.044}{6.022 \times 10^{23}} \approx 7.307 \times 10^{-26} \, \mathrm{kg}
\]

### Step 2: Compute \((kT)^{3/2}\)
\[
kT = (1.380649 \times 10^{-23}) \cdot 273 \approx 3.7674 \times 10^{-21} \, \mathrm{J}
\]

\[
(kT)^{3/2} = (3.7674 \times 10^{-21})^{3/2} \approx 2.313 \times 10^{-31} \, \mathrm{J^{3/2}}
\]

### Step 3: Compute numerator
\[
\text{Numerator} = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{(kT)^{3/2}}{D} = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{2.313 \times 10^{-31}}{1.00 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 1.542 \times 10^{-26}
\]

### Step 4: Compute denominator
\[
\sqrt{\pi m} = \sqrt{3.1416 \cdot 7.307 \times 10^{-26}} \approx 4.796 \times 10^{-13} \, \mathrm{kg^{1/2}}
\]

\[
\text{Denominator} = P \cdot \sqrt{\pi m} = 101325 \cdot 4.796 \times 10^{-13} \approx 4.863 \times 10^{-8}
\]

### Step 5: Compute σ
\[
\sigma = \frac{\text{Numerator}}{\text{Denominator}} = \frac{1.542 \times 10^{-26}}{4.863 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 3.172 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{m}^2
\]

Convert to nm²:

\[
1 \, \mathrm{m}^2 = 10^{18} \, \mathrm{nm}^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sigma \approx 3.172 \times 10^{-19} \cdot 10^{18} \approx 0.3172 \, \mathrm{nm}^2
\]

### Step 6: Match with options
The closest option is **E: 0.318 nm²**.
