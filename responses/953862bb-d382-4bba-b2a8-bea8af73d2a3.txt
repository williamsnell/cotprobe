Question:

A 44-year-old woman with a 10-year history of arthritis comes to the office because she has had increasing pain and stiffness in her hands, wrists, and knees during the past several months. She also has had increasing fatigue for the past month, along with a weight loss of 1.8 to 2.2 kg (4 to 5 lb). She has seen numerous physicians for her arthritis in the past and has tried various medications and devices, including copper bracelets from Mexico given to her by friends. Review of her medical records confirms that the initial diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is correct. She says, "I had several drop attacks during the past 3 months." She characterizes these attacks as episodes of weakness and loss of feeling in her legs for several minutes. During one of these episodes, she became incontinent. She currently takes aspirin approximately four times daily and ibuprofen occasionally. Physical examination shows facial plethora and swollen and painful metacarpophalangeal and knee joints, bilaterally. There is moderate ulnar deviation of the fingers. The remainder of the examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her "drop attacks?"

Options:

A: Side effect of the copper bracelets
B: Spinal stenosis
C: Reaction to aspirin or ibuprofen
D: Cardiac arrhythmia
E: Anxiety
F: Neurological side effects of rheumatoid arthritis
G: Transient ischemic attack
H: Adrenal insufficiency
I: Hypoglycemia
J: Atlanto-axial instability

Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about a 44-year-old woman with a history of arthritis. She's been having increasing pain and stiffness in her hands, wrists, and knees. She also mentions fatigue, weight loss, and these "drop attacks" where she feels weak and loses feeling in her legs for several minutes. One of these episodes even caused her to become incontinent.

First, her medical history says she has rheumatoid arthritis, and the initial diagnosis was correct. She's been trying various treatments, including copper bracelets, which some people believe can help with arthritis. But she's been taking aspirin and ibuprofen, and the physical exam shows swollen joints with ulnar deviation, which is typical in rheumatoid arthritis.

The key here is the "drop attacks." These episodes sound like they're related to some sort of neurological issue since she loses feeling and has weakness in her legs. Also, the incontinence during one episode suggests that there might be a problem with the nerves controlling bladder function.

Looking at the options:

A: Side effect of copper bracelets. I don't think copper bracelets have any proven medical benefits, but I'm not sure about side effects causing neurological issues. Maybe it's possible, but not the first thing that comes to mind.

B: Spinal stenosis. This is a narrowing of the spinal canal that can compress nerves, leading to pain and weakness, especially in the legs. It's more common in older adults and can cause episodes of weakness, but does it cause sudden attacks? Maybe, but I'm not sure.

C: Reaction to aspirin or ibuprofen. These are NSAIDs, and they can have side effects like gastrointestinal issues or kidney problems, but I'm not sure they cause sudden neurological symptoms like weakness and incontinence. Maybe if there's an allergic reaction, but that's usually more systemic and not just in the legs.

D: Cardiac arrhythmia. This could cause dizziness or fainting, but the weakness and incontinence don't quite fit. Fainting is more about loss of consciousness, but incontinence during that might happen, but I'm not sure if it's the main cause here.

E: Anxiety. Anxiety can cause various symptoms, including shaking, sweating, and sometimes even physical weakness, but does it cause sudden episodes of weakness in the legs? Maybe panic attacks can mimic some symptoms, but incontinence seems like a stretch.

F: Neurological side effects of rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis can sometimes lead to other autoimmune conditions, like rheumatoid neuropathy, which affects nerves. This could cause weakness and sensory issues in the legs. The drop attacks could be due to nerve inflammation or entrapment.

G: Transient ischemic attack (TIA). This is a mini-stroke and can cause sudden weakness or numbness, often on one side. But the episodes here are in the legs, and she didn't mention unilateral symptoms. Also, TIAs are usually more acute and might have other symptoms like facial drooping or speech issues, which aren't mentioned.

H: Adrenal insufficiency. This can cause fatigue and weight loss, but I'm not sure how it would directly cause sudden neurological episodes. Maybe through hormone imbalances affecting the nervous system, but it seems less likely.

I: Hypoglycemia. Low blood sugar can cause weakness, shaking, sweating, and confusion, but again, would it cause incontinence? Maybe if she passed out from low blood sugar, but she didn't mention other typical hypoglycemic symptoms.

J: Atlanto-axial instability. This is a condition where the first and second vertebrae in the neck are unstable, which can compress the spinal cord. This can cause episodes of weakness, numbness, and incontinence. It's more common in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis because the ligaments can be affected, leading to instability in the upper spine.

So, considering all this, the "drop attacks" with weakness, loss of feeling, and incontinence point more towards a neurological issue. Rheumatoid arthritis can sometimes lead to atlanto-axial instability, which would cause these episodes. Alternatively, it could be neurological side effects from the disease itself, like inflammation affecting the nerves. But between F and J, which is more likely?

Atlanto-axial instability is a known complication in rheumatoid arthritis. It can cause sudden neurological symptoms because of pressure on the spinal cord. The symptoms described fit well with this, especially the incontinence, which suggests involvement of the autonomic nervous system or spinal cord compression.

Therefore, the most likely answer is J: Atlanto-axial instability.
</think>

The patient's symptoms, including "drop attacks" with weakness, loss of feeling in the legs, and incontinence, suggest a neurological issue. Given her history of rheumatoid arthritis, atlanto-axial instability is a known complication where inflammation and joint damage can destabilize the upper spine, compressing the spinal cord and causing such episodes. This aligns with her symptoms, making J the most likely answer.

Answer: J
