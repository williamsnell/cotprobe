E: An increase in partial pressure of carbon dioxide and a decrease in concentration of hydrogen ions
F: A decrease in partial pressure of carbon dioxide and no change in concentration of hydrogen ions
G: An increase in both partial pressure of carbon dioxide and concentration of hydrogen ions, but at different rates
H: An increase in partial pressure of carbon dioxide and no change in concentration of hydrogen ions
I: No change in partial pressure of carbon dioxide and a decrease in concentration of hydrogen ions
J: An increase in partial pressure of carbon dioxide and an increase in concentration of hydrogen ions

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this question about hyperventilation and its effects on blood chemistry. Let me break it down step by step.

Okay, the question says a healthy person is sitting at rest and starts breathing too fast. So, hyperventilation. I remember that hyperventilation means breathing more rapidly than needed, which leads to increased respiration.

Now, I need to think about what happens to the blood in this situation. Specifically, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide and the concentration of hydrogen ions. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to recall.

First, when you breathe faster, you're taking in more oxygen and exhaling more carbon dioxide. The body's cells still produce carbon dioxide as a waste product, but if you're breathing more, you might expel more CO2 than usual. So, the partial pressure of CO2 in the blood should decrease because you're getting rid of it faster than it's being produced.

Next, the concentration of hydrogen ions. I remember that carbon dioxide dissolves in blood and forms carbonic acid, which then dissociates into bicarbonate ions and hydrogen ions. So, if CO2 levels go down, there's less carbonic acid, which should mean fewer H+ ions. That would make the blood less acidic, right?

Wait, but the body has buffers to maintain pH balance, like the bicarbonate buffer system. So if CO2 levels drop, the H+ concentration would also drop because there's less CO2 to convert into H+. So, both partial pressure of CO2 and H+ concentration would decrease.

Looking at the options, B says both decrease, which matches what I'm thinking. Let me check the other options quickly. Option D says CO2 decreases and H+ increases, which doesn't make sense because less CO2 should lead to less H+. Option F says CO2 decreases and H+ stays the same, but I think H+ would also decrease. So yeah, B seems right.

When a person hyperventrilates, they exhale more carbon dioxide (CO2) than usual. This leads to a decrease in the partial pressure of CO2 in the blood. Since CO2 is involved in the formation of carbonic acid (H2CO3), which dissociates into bicarbonate (HCO3-) and hydrogen ions (H+), a lower CO2 level results in fewer H+ ions. Therefore, both the partial pressure of CO2 and the concentration of hydrogen ions decrease.

Answer: B
