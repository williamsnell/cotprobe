Okay, so I have this logic question to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying the antecedent of a conditional proposition. Let's break it down.

First, the proposition given is: "When the university raises tuition, then either the governor approves of it or the board of trustees doesn't prevent it." So, in logical terms, this is a conditional statement. I remember that a conditional proposition is usually structured as "If A, then B." Here, A is the antecedent, and B is the consequent.

So, I need to figure out what part of the statement is A (the antecedent) and what is B (the consequent). The question is asking specifically for the antecedent.

Looking at the statement, it starts with "When the university raises tuition." This seems like the condition that must be met for the rest of the statement to hold. So, that would be A, the antecedent. The rest of the statement after "then" would be B, the consequent.

Wait, but the way it's phrased is a bit different. It says "When the university raises tuition, then..." which is a bit like saying "If the university raises tuition, then..." So, yeah, the first part is the condition, which is the antecedent.

Now, I need to look at the options given and see which one matches the antecedent. The options are labeled A through J.

Option B is "The university raises tuition." That matches exactly with the first part of the proposition, which is the antecedent. So, it seems like B is the correct answer.

Just to double-check, let's make sure I'm not confusing the consequent with the antecedent. The consequent is the part after "then," which in this case is "either the governor approves of it or the board of trustees doesn't prevent it." None of the other options directly match this part, so that's not relevant to finding the antecedent.

Looking at the other options, like A is about the board preventing it, which is part of the consequent, not the condition. Option E is about the governor approving, which is also part of the consequent. So, yeah, B is definitely the antecedent.

The antecedent is the condition that must be met for the consequent to follow. In the given proposition, the antecedent is "The university raises tuition."

Answer: B
