Okay, so I've got this economics question here about natural monopolies and government regulation. Hmm, I remember that a natural monopoly is when one company can supply the entire market at a lower cost than multiple firms. So the government might want to regulate it to ensure it operates efficiently.

The question is asking about the output level that would make it allocatively efficient. Allocative efficiency is when resources are allocated in a way that maximizes the total surplus, meaning production is at the point where marginal cost equals marginal revenue, right? Because that's where the last unit added contributes as much to revenue as it does to cost, so society's resources are being used optimally.

Wait, but wait. For a monopoly, the firm sets price where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, but that's not necessarily the allocatively efficient point. Oh, no, wait, actually, in a perfectly competitive market, allocative efficiency occurs where price equals marginal cost. But a monopoly doesn't do that because it sets price higher than marginal cost to maximize profits.

But if the government wants the monopoly to produce an allocatively efficient level, they'd have to make it act more like a competitive firm. So they'd set the price equal to marginal cost. That way, the output is where MC equals price, which is the allocatively efficient point. So looking at the options, E says where price equals marginal cost. That sounds right.

Let me check the options again. Option B is where MR equals MC, which is the standard profit-maximizing point for a monopoly, but that's not allocative efficiency. Option F is price equals average total cost, which I think relates to normal profits, but not efficiency. Option E is the one where price is equal to MC, which should be the correct answer for allocative efficiency.

The correct answer is E: where price is equal to marginal cost. This ensures that the natural monopoly operates at allocative efficiency, maximizing total surplus by aligning price and marginal cost.

Answer: E
