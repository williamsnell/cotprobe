Question:

This question refers to the following information.
While some theorists in the Middle Ages argued that the jihad was a defensive warâ€¦ most authorities held that the obligation of jihad did not lapse until all the world was brought under the sway of Islam. The Bahr [al-Fava'id, or "Sea of Precious Virtues," written in the 1150s or 1160s] insists that the first duty of a Muslim ruler is to prosecute the jihad and bring about the victory of Islam, and if he does not do so and he makes peace with the infidel, that ruler would be better dead than alive, for he would be corrupting the world.
Robert Irwin, "Islam and the Crusades," 1995
It is strange how the Christians round Mount Lebanon, when they see any Muslim hermits, bring them food and treat them kindly, saying that these men are dedicated to the Great and Glorious God and that they should therefore share with them. Likewise, not one Christian merchant was stopped or hindered in Muslim territories.
Ibn Jubayr, Muslim scholar, traveling to Mecca and Jerusalem, ca. 1185

Okay, so I'm looking at this question about a historical text and what it supports in terms of traditional historical assumptions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question refers to a passage from Robert Irwin's work, which quotes a text called "Bahr al-Fava'id." The passage says that most Middle Age Muslim authorities believed the obligation of jihad didn't end until the whole world was under Islam. The text emphasizes that a Muslim ruler's first duty is to prosecute jihad and bring about Islamic victory. If they make peace with non-believers, they're better off dead because they're corrupting the world.

So, I need to figure out what this supports. The options given are from A to J, each proposing a different assumption about Muslims during the crusading era.

First, the passage is talking about jihad as an ongoing obligation until the world is Islamic. This suggests that the concept of holy war (jihad) was taken seriously by the Muslim elites, like rulers and scholars. The author is emphasizing that not fulfilling this duty is a major sin, almost to the point where the ruler would be better off dead than making peace with non-Muslims.

Looking at the options:

A: Economic gain vs. religious fervor. The passage doesn't talk about economics; it's about the duty to wage jihad, so maybe not A.

B: Peaceful co-existence. The passage seems to say the opposite, as jihad is a priority, so probably not B.

C: Scholarly pursuits over warfare. The passage is about warfare (jihad), so C doesn't fit.

D: Muslims more peaceful than Christians. The passage is about Muslims being committed to jihad, so D might not be correct.

E: Many Muslims driven by Islamic faith to be violent. This seems related because the passage talks about jihad as a religious duty, implying a connection between faith and warfare.

F: Only protecting territory. The passage is broader, about spreading Islam worldwide, so F might not fit.

G: Ideology of holy war taken seriously by elites. This seems to fit because the text is from a scholar (Bahr al-Fava'id) and talks about the ruler's primary duty being jihad.

H: Holy war dismissed by elites. The passage says the opposite, so H is incorrect.

I: Indifferent towards holy war. Again, the passage shows it's taken very seriously, so I is wrong.

J: Interested in converting Christians. While jihad is about spreading Islam, the passage focuses on the duty aspect rather than conversion methods, so J might not be the best fit.

Wait, but the passage is about the obligation of jihad, which is a holy war, and the text is from a scholar, indicating that the elites (like scholars and rulers) took this ideology seriously. So option G seems to fit because it says the ideology was taken seriously by the elites.

Option E talks about being driven by faith to be violent. The passage supports that jihad was a religious duty, which might imply some level of violent intent, but the question is about what the passage supports in terms of traditional assumptions. The question is about the first passage, which is from Irwin's work, and he's discussing the Bahr al-Fava'id text.

The Bahr al-Fava'id insists that the first duty is jihad, and failure to do so is a major sin. So this shows that the ideology of holy war was a serious matter for the Muslim elites, not that they were necessarily all violent, but that the concept was taken seriously as a religious duty.

Therefore, the correct answer should be G: That the ideology of holy war was taken seriously by Muslim elites during the crusading era.

The passage from "Bahr al-Fava'id" emphasizes that jihad was a primary duty for Muslim rulers during the crusading era, suggesting that the ideology of holy war was taken seriously by Muslim elites. This aligns with option G, as the text highlights the religious obligation and the severe consequences of not fulfilling it, indicating a serious engagement with the concept of holy war among scholars and rulers.

Answer: G
