Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here about calculating the range, variance, and standard deviation for a dataset. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the dataset given is: 2, 3, 0, 4, 1, 3, 0. Hmm, wait, that's seven numbers. Oh, the question says eight households, but maybe I miscounted. Let me check: 2,3,0,4,1,3,0... that's seven. Oh well, maybe it's a typo, but I'll proceed with the seven numbers provided.

Alright, let's start with the range. The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values in the dataset. So, looking at the numbers: the highest is 4, and the lowest is 0. So the range is 4 - 0 = 4. So any option with a range other than 4 can be eliminated. Let me look at the options.

Options: A has range 3, B:3, C:4, D:2, E:4, F:5, G:5, H:4, I:4, J:5. So options C, E, H, I are possible.

Next, I need to calculate the variance and standard deviation. Since the data is a sample, I think we use the sample variance formula, which divides by (n-1) instead of n. Wait, the question doesn't specify whether it's population or sample, but since it's a survey of 8 households, it might be a sample. But wait, the data given has 7 numbers. Hmm, maybe the question had a typo, but I'll proceed with the 7 numbers.

Wait, the data given is 2,3,0,4,1,3,0 — that's seven numbers. So n=7. So I'll calculate sample variance.

First, find the mean. Sum all the numbers: 2+3=5, +0=5, +4=9, +1=10, +3=13, +0=13. So total is 13. Mean is 13/7 ≈ 1.8571.

Now, find each data point's deviation from the mean, square them, sum, then divide by (n-1) for sample variance.

Let's calculate each (x_i - mean)^2:

1. For 2: (2 - 1.8571) = 0.1429 → squared ≈ 0.0204
2. 3: (3 - 1.8571)=1.1429 → squared ≈ 1.3069
3. 0: (0 - 1.8571)= -1.8571 → squared ≈ 3.4514
4. 4: (4-1.8571)=2.1429 → squared ≈4.5918
5. 1: (1-1.8571)= -0.8571 → squared≈0.7347
6. 3: same as second, so 1.3069
7. 0: same as third, so 3.4514

Now, sum all these squared deviations:

0.0204 + 1.3069 = 1.3273
+3.4514 = 4.7787
+4.5918 = 9.3705
+0.7347 = 10.1052
+1.3069 = 11.4121
+3.4514 = 14.8635

So total sum of squared deviations is approximately 14.8635.

Sample variance is this sum divided by (n-1) = 7-1=6. So 14.8635 /6 ≈ 2.47725.

Wait, that's the sample variance. But let me double-check my calculations, because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, let me recalculate each squared term more accurately.

1. 2: (2 - 13/7) = (14/7 -13/7)=1/7 → (1/7)^2=1/49≈0.0204
2. 3: (3 - 13/7)= (21/7 -13/7)=8/7 → (8/7)^2=64/49≈1.3061
3. 0: (0-13/7)= -13/7 → (13/7)^2=169/49≈3.44898
4. 4: (4-13/7)= (28/7 -13/7)=15/7 → (15/7)^2=225/49≈4.5918
5. 1: (1-13/7)= (-6/7) → (6/7)^2=36/49≈0.7347
6. 3: same as second → 64/49≈1.3061
7. 0: same as third → 169/49≈3.44898

Now sum these fractions:

1/49 +64/49 +169/49 +225/49 +36/49 +64/49 +169/49

Adding numerators:

1 +64=65; +169=234; +225=459; +36=495; +64=559; +169=728.

So sum is 728/49. Now, 728 ÷49. Let's see: 49*14=686, 728-686=42, so 14 + 42/49 =14.8571.

So sum of squared deviations is 728/49 =14.8571.

Sample variance = 14.8571/(7-1) =14.8571/6≈2.47618.

So sample variance is approximately 2.476.

Looking back at the options, none of them have variance exactly 2.476. Let's see the options:

Looking at the options for variance:

C: 2.2, E:2, H:1.5, I:3. So none of these match. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, the dataset is 2,3,0,4,1,3,0. So n=7.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the question is considering the population variance, which would be sum/(n), not n-1.

So population variance would be 14.8571/7≈2.1224.

Hmm, but the options don't have that either.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the sum of squared deviations. Let me add the fractions again:

1. 1/49 = 0.0204
2. 64/49 ≈1.3061
3. 169/49≈3.44898
4. 225/49≈4.5918
5. 36/49≈0.7347
6. 64/49≈1.3061
7. 169/49≈3.44898

Adding these:

0.0204 +1.3061 =1.3265
+3.44898=4.77548
+4.5918=9.36728
+0.7347=10.10198
+1.3061=11.40808
+3.44898=14.85706.

Yes, so sum is about 14.8571.

So sample variance is 14.8571/6≈2.476.

Population variance would be 14.8571/7≈2.122457.

Looking at the options again, none of them have variance around 2.476 or 2.122. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using the formula correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it as:

Variance formula: Σ(xi - μ)^2 / N, where μ is the mean.

Wait, but the problem is whether it's sample or population. Since the question says "the survey yielded the following results: 2,3,0,4,1,3,0." So it's a sample of 7 households, not 8. Wait, the first line says it was distributed to eight households, but the data has seven numbers. Maybe that's a mistake, but I'll proceed with seven.

If I'm calculating the sample variance, it's 2.476, but the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Wait, looking at option E: Range:4, Variance:2, SD≈1.414.

Option I: Range:4, Variance:3, SD≈1.732.

Option C: Range:4, Variance:2.2, SD≈1.483.

Option H: Range:4, Variance:1.5, SD≈1.225.

None of these have variance around 2.476. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the mean more accurately.

Mean = (2+3+0+4+1+3+0) = 13. So 13 divided by 7 is approximately 1.857142857.

Now, let's re-calculate each (xi - mean)^2:

1. (2 - 1.8571) = 0.1429 → squared ≈0.02041
2. (3 - 1.8571)=1.1429 → squared≈1.3069
3. (0 - 1.8571)=-1.8571 → squared≈3.4489
4. (4 -1.8571)=2.1429 → squared≈4.5918
5. (1 -1.8571)=-0.8571 → squared≈0.7347
6. (3 -1.8571)=1.1429 → squared≈1.3069
7. (0 -1.8571)=-1.8571 → squared≈3.4489

Adding these up:

0.02041 +1.3069 =1.32731
+3.4489=4.77621
+4.5918=9.36801
+0.7347=10.10271
+1.3069=11.40961
+3.4489=14.85851.

So sum is approximately 14.8585.

Sample variance: 14.8585/(7-1)=14.8585/6≈2.4764.

Population variance:14.8585/7≈2.1226.

Wait, but none of the options have variance around 2.476 or 2.122. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe the data is considered as a population, not a sample. So population variance would be 14.8585/7≈2.1226. Let's see if any option matches.

Looking at the options, option E has variance 2, which is close but not exact. Option I has variance 3, which is higher. So maybe I made a mistake in the sum.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recompute the sum of squared deviations.

Let me list each (xi - mean)^2:

2: (2 - 13/7)= (14/7 -13/7)=1/7 → (1/7)^2=1/49=0.020408...

3: (3 -13/7)= (21/7 -13/7)=8/7 → (8/7)^2=64/49≈1.30612245...

0: (-13/7)^2=169/49≈3.44897959...

4: (4 -13/7)= (28/7 -13/7)=15/7 → (15/7)^2=225/49≈4.59183673...

1: (1 -13/7)= (-6/7) → (6/7)^2=36/49≈0.73469388...

3: same as the second, 64/49.

0: same as third, 169/49.

Now, adding all these fractions:

1/49 +64/49 +169/49 +225/49 +36/49 +64/49 +169/49.

Adding numerators: 1 +64=65; +169=234; +225=459; +36=495; +64=559; +169=728.

So total is 728/49=14.857142857.

So sum is 14.857142857.

If it's population variance, 14.8571/7≈2.12245.

Sample variance: 14.8571/6≈2.47618.

Looking again at the options, none have variance around 2.122 or 2.476.

Wait, maybe I should check the options again. Let me list all options with range 4:

C: Range 4, Variance 2.2, SD≈1.483.

E: Range 4, Variance 2, SD≈1.414.

H: Range 4, Variance 1.5, SD≈1.225.

I: Range 4, Variance 3, SD≈1.732.

So none have variance 2.122 or 2.476. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the variance correctly, perhaps using another method.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the data is a sample of 8, but the data provided is 7. Maybe the question intended 8 data points, perhaps I missed one.

Wait, the question says "eight randomly selected households" but the data has seven numbers. Maybe I misread the data. Let me check again.

The data given is: 2,3,0,4,1,3,0. Yes, that's seven numbers. So perhaps the correct approach is to proceed with n=7.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the variance as a population, which would be 14.8571/7≈2.12245.

Looking at the options, option E has variance 2, which is close but not exact. But perhaps due to rounding, let's see.

Wait, maybe I should check the standard deviation. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.

If population variance is 2.12245, then SD is sqrt(2.12245)≈1.457.

Looking at the options, option E has SD 1.414, which is sqrt(2)=1.4142, so it's close to my 1.457, but not exact.

Alternatively, if sample variance is 2.476, then SD is sqrt(2.476)≈1.573.

Looking at the options, option B has SD≈1.581, which is close to 1.573.

But option B has range 3, which we know is incorrect because the range is 4.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I should calculate using the formula for variance more carefully.

Another approach: Compute each (xi - mean)^2, sum them, and then divide by n-1.

But perhaps I should recalculate the sum of squares.

Wait, the data points are 0,0,1,2,3,3,4.

Mean is 13/7≈1.8571.

Compute each squared deviation:

0: (0 - 1.8571)^2 ≈ ( -1.8571 )^2 ≈3.44898.

0: same as above.

1: (1 -1.8571)^2 ≈ (-0.8571)^2≈0.73469.

2: (2-1.8571)^2≈(0.1429)^2≈0.02041.

3: (3-1.8571)^2≈(1.1429)^2≈1.3069.

3: same as above.

4: (4-1.8571)^2≈(2.1429)^2≈4.5918.

Now, sum all these:

3.44898 +3.44898=6.89796

+0.73469=7.63265

+0.02041=7.65306

+1.3069=8.95996

+1.3069=10.26686

+4.5918=14.85866.

So sum is approximately 14.8587.

Sample variance: 14.8587 /6≈2.47645.

Population variance:14.8587/7≈2.12267.

So sample variance is ~2.476, population ~2.122.

Looking at the options, none match exactly. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the sample variance, but none of the options have 2.476. Let me check the options again.

Wait, option E: Range 4, Variance 2, SD≈1.414.

Option I: Range 4, Variance 3, SD≈1.732.

Option C: Range 4, Variance 2.2, SD≈1.483.

Option B: Range 3, Variance 2.5, SD≈1.581.

Wait, option B has SD≈1.581, which is close to sqrt(2.476)=1.573. But option B's range is 3, which is wrong.

So perhaps the correct option is not listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the range.

Wait, the data is 0,0,1,2,3,3,4. So highest is 4, lowest 0. So range is 4-0=4. So options with range 4 are C, E, H, I.

Now, among these, which have a variance close to 2.122 or 2.476.

Option C: Variance 2.2, which is close to 2.122.

Option E: Variance 2, which is a bit lower.

Option H: Variance 1.5, too low.

Option I: Variance 3, higher than both.

So option C has variance 2.2, which is close to our population variance of 2.122.

So perhaps the correct answer is option C: Range 4, Variance 2.2, SD≈1.483.

But wait, let me check the standard deviation for variance 2.2. sqrt(2.2)≈1.4832, which matches option C's SD.

So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Alternatively, maybe the variance was calculated as a population variance of approximately 2.122, which would round to 2.1, but option C is 2.2.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum of squared deviations.

Wait, let's recompute the sum precisely.

Each (xi - mean)^2:

0: (0 - 13/7)^2 = ( -13/7 )^2 = 169/49 = 3.44897959...

Another 0: same as above, 3.44897959...

1: (1 -13/7)^2 = (-6/7)^2=36/49≈0.73469388...

2: (2 -13/7)^2=(1/7)^2=1/49≈0.02040816...

3: (3 -13/7)^2=(8/7)^2=64/49≈1.30612245...

Another 3: same as above, 1.30612245...

4: (4 -13/7)^2=(15/7)^2=225/49≈4.59183673...

Now, sum these:

3.44897959 +3.44897959 =6.89795918

+0.73469388 =7.63265306

+0.02040816 =7.65306122

+1.30612245 =8.95918367

+1.30612245 =10.2653061

+4.59183673 =14.8571428.

So sum is exactly 14.8571428.

Now, population variance: 14.8571428 /7 =2.12245.

Sample variance:14.8571428 /6≈2.47619.

So, none of the options have these exact values. But option C has variance 2.2, which is close to 2.122.

But wait, perhaps the question intended to use the formula for variance without dividing by n-1 or n. Maybe I should check if the variance is computed as sum squared deviations divided by n, which would be the population variance.

So population variance is 2.12245, which is approximately 2.12. The closest option is E with variance 2, but that's a bit off.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the data was considered as a sample of 8, but the data has 7 points. Maybe I missed a data point. Let me check the question again.

The question says: "The survey yielded the following results: 2, 3, 0, 4, 1, 3, 0." So seven numbers. Therefore, n=7.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but I need to choose the closest one.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the mean.

Wait, sum of data: 2+3=5, +0=5, +4=9, +1=10, +3=13, +0=13. Yes, 13. So mean is 13/7≈1.8571.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but I need to choose from the options.

Looking back at the options, option E has variance 2, which is the closest to our population variance of 2.122.

But option C has variance 2.2, which is closer. So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the question intended to use the sample variance formula, which would be 2.476, but none of the options have that.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option B: Range 3, Variance 2.5, SD≈1.581.

Wait, if the range was 3, that would mean the highest minus lowest is 3, but in our data, it's 4. So option B is invalid.

Option E: Range 4, Variance 2, SD≈1.414.

Option C: Range 4, Variance 2.2, SD≈1.483.

Given that, perhaps the correct answer is option C, as it's the closest to our calculated population variance of ~2.122.

But wait, 2.2 is a bit higher than 2.122, but it's the closest among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the variance was calculated as 2.5, which is option B, but B's range is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum of squared deviations. Let me add them again precisely.

Sum of squared deviations:

3.44897959 +3.44897959 =6.89795918

+0.73469388 =7.63265306

+0.02040816 =7.65306122

+1.30612245 =8.95918367

+1.30612245 =10.2653061

+4.59183673 =14.8571428.

Yes, that's correct.

So, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but I have to choose the best option.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the standard deviation is being asked, and we can compute it from the options.

Given that, if the variance is 2.2, the SD is sqrt(2.2)=1.4832, which matches option C.

Alternatively, if the variance is 2, SD is 1.414, which is option E.

But our calculated population variance is ~2.122, which would give SD≈1.457.

Looking at the options, option E's SD is 1.414, which is lower than our calculated 1.457, and option C's SD is 1.483, which is higher.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option C, as it's the closest.

The dataset provided is: 2, 3, 0, 4, 1, 3, 0.

   - Among the remaining options, option C (Variance: 2.2, SD: 1.483) is the closest to the calculated values, as \(2.2\) is close to \(2.122\) and \(1.483\) is close to \(1.457\).

**Answer: C**
