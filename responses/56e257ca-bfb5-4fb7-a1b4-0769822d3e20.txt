Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out the greatest odd integer that's a factor of 5!. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the exclamation mark in math stands for factorial, right? So 5! means 5 multiplied by 4, 3, 2, and 1. Let me write that out to make sure I get it right. So 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1. Let me calculate that. 5 times 4 is 20, times 3 is 60, times 2 is 120, and times 1 stays 120. So 5! equals 120.

Now, the question is asking for the greatest odd integer that is a factor of 120. Hmm, okay, so I need to find the largest odd number that divides 120 without leaving a remainder. 

Let me list the factors of 120 to see which ones are odd. Factors are numbers you can multiply together to get 120. So starting from 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., up to 120. But since we're looking for the greatest odd one, maybe I can find the largest odd number less than or equal to 120 that divides 120.

Wait, but maybe a better approach is to factorize 120 into its prime factors and then see which combination gives the largest odd number. That might be more efficient.

So, let's break down 120 into primes. 120 divided by 2 is 60. 60 divided by 2 is 30. 30 divided by 2 is 15. Now, 15 can't be divided by 2, so I move to the next prime number, which is 3. 15 divided by 3 is 5. And 5 is a prime number itself. So putting it all together, 120 = 2^3 × 3^1 × 5^1.

Wait, so the prime factors are 2, 3, and 5. Now, to find the greatest odd factor, I need to ignore the factors of 2 because any number multiplied by 2 would make it even. So I should look at the product of the other prime factors, which are 3 and 5.

The product of 3 and 5 is 15. So 15 is the largest odd factor because any higher odd number that divides 120 would have to be a multiple of 15, but 15 times 3 is 45, which is still a factor, but wait, is 45 a factor of 120?

Let me check: 120 divided by 45 is... 120 ÷ 45 = 2.666..., which isn't an integer. So 45 isn't a factor. Hmm, so maybe 15 is the highest odd factor.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are there any other odd factors larger than 15? Let me list all the factors of 120 and pick the largest odd one.

Factors of 120: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120.

Now, looking for the odd ones: 1, 3, 5, 15. So the largest among these is 15. So the answer should be 15.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought 45 was a factor, but it's not. So the correct answer must be 15. Let me look at the options.

The options are A:31, B:3, C:7, D:5, E:45, F:21, G:1, H:25, I:15, J:9.

So option I is 15, which is the answer I arrived at. So the greatest odd integer factor of 5! (which is 120) is 15.

The greatest odd integer that is a factor of 5! (which equals 120) is 15.
