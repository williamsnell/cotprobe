Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about gerrymandering, and I need to find the statement that's the exception. Let me break it down step by step.

First, what do I know about gerrymandering? It's the practice of redrawing electoral district boundaries to advantage one party or group. It can be done to either increase the number of districts a party wins or to dilute the voting power of the opposing side.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's universally disallowed in all democratic nations. Hmm, I'm not sure about that. I know some countries have laws against it, but others might allow it under certain conditions. For example, the U.S. allows it but has some Supreme Court rulings that limit it, like the ones regarding racial gerrymandering. So maybe A is the exception because not all democratic nations disallow it.

Option B claims it's only possible in a multi-party system. That doesn't sound right. Gerrymandering can happen in two-party systems too, like in the U.S., which is a multi-party but effectively two-party dominant. So B is probably false, making it a candidate for the exception.

Option C states that both major U.S. parties use it. I remember reading that both Democrats and Republicans have engaged in gerrymandering to their advantage. So C is true, not the exception.

Option D says it can increase voter turnout. Wait, how? If districts are drawn to include more of a certain group, maybe they feel more represented and thus more likely to vote. Or perhaps it's the opposite—if districts are packed, maybe turnout isn't necessarily increased. I'm a bit unsure about this one. I'll need to think more.

Option E mentions dividing like-minded voters into several districts to reduce their influence. That sounds like the opposite of what gerrymandering does. Usually, you'd pack them into one district to concentrate their votes, or spread them to dilute. Wait, no—if you spread them thin across districts, their influence is diluted. But the option says dividing into several districts to reduce their influence. That seems accurate. So E is a true statement, not the exception.

Option F says it's used to increase districts with minority majorities. Yes, that's a common tactic, especially to meet certain quotas or to ensure minority representation. So F is true.

Option G claims it's allowed by the Supreme Court in some instances. Yes, the Supreme Court has ruled on gerrymandering cases, sometimes allowing it if it's not based on race, for example. So G is true.

Option H states it increases voters' control over elected officials. That doesn't make sense. Gerrymandering usually reduces competition, making it harder for voters to hold officials accountable because districts are drawn to be safe for one party. So H is likely false, making it a candidate for the exception.

Option I says it favors incumbents. Yes, because redistricting can protect incumbents by ensuring their district remains favorable. So I is true.

Now, going back. The question asks which statement is NOT true about gerrymandering. So I need to find the false statement.

Looking again:

A: Universally disallowed? Probably not. Some countries allow it, so A is false.

B: Only possible in multi-party systems? No, as the U.S. shows, so B is false.

D: Increase voter turnout? I'm not sure. Maybe not. If districts are packed, maybe some voters feel their vote is more effective, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, gerrymandering might reduce competition, leading to lower turnout. Or maybe it's neutral. So D might be true or not.

H: Increases control over elected officials? That's false. Gerrymandering reduces control because districts become less competitive.

So the exceptions could be A, B, D, H.

Wait, the question is asking which is the exception (the false statement). So the correct answer is the one that's false.

Let me think again.

Option A: "is a practice that is universally disallowed in all democratic nations." I think this is false because, for example, the U.S. allows gerrymandering, though it's regulated. So A is the false statement.

Option B: "is a process that is only possible within a multi-party system." No, two-party systems can also gerrymander. So B is also false.

Option H: "increases the control voters have over their elected officials." No, actually, it does the opposite; voters have less control because districts are less competitive. So H is false.

But the question is which is the exception (the false statement). So the answer must be the one that's not true.

Wait, the question is asking which statement is NOT true. So all except one are true, and I need to find the false one.

Looking back at the options:

A: False. Not all democratic nations disallow gerrymandering.

B: False. Gerrymandering can happen in two-party systems.

D: Not sure, but maybe it can increase turnout if voters feel their district is more representative, but I'm not certain.

H: False. It decreases control.

So the options that are false are A, B, H, and possibly D.

Wait, the question is asking which is the exception (the false statement). So the correct answer is the one that's false.

Looking at the options again, the question is which is the exception, meaning it's NOT a true statement about gerrymandering.

So, the options:

A: False (not universally disallowed)

B: False (can happen in two-party systems)

D: ?

H: False (it doesn't increase control)

So the options for the exception are A, B, H, and possibly D.

Wait, the question is asking which is the exception. So the correct answer is the one that's false.

Looking at the options again, I think the correct answer is A: is a practice that is universally disallowed in all democratic nations. Because it's not true; some allow it.

But wait, the options are:

A: is universally disallowed

B: only possible in multi-party

C: both parties use it in U.S.

D: can increase voter turnout

E: divide like-minded voters to reduce influence (true?)

F: increase minority districts

G: allowed by Supreme Court

H: increases voters' control

I: favors incumbents

So, the exception is the false statement.

A is false because not all democratic nations disallow it.

B is false because it can happen in two-party systems.

H is false because gerrymandering reduces control.

So the options A, B, H are false.

But the question is which is the exception. So the answer is one of these.

Wait, the question says "the following statements are true EXCEPT that it".

So I need to pick the statement that is NOT true.

Looking at the options, A says it's universally disallowed, which is false because it's allowed in some countries.

B says it's only possible in multi-party, which is false because two-party systems can do it.

H says it increases control, which is false because it reduces it.

So the options A, B, H are false.

But the question is which is the exception, so the answer is one of them.

Wait, the options are from A to J, and the correct answer is one of them.

The correct answer is the statement that is false.

So the options are:

A: False

B: False

H: False

So the question is, which is the exception, meaning which is the false statement.

So all except one are true.

Looking back at the options, perhaps the correct answer is A, because while some countries disallow it, others don't. So A is the false statement.

Alternatively, B is false because gerrymandering can occur in two-party systems.

H is also false.

But the question is, which one is the exception.

Wait, the correct answer is probably A because it's the most obvious. Because in many democratic nations, gerrymandering is allowed but regulated. So A is false.

Alternatively, B is also false, but the question is about which is the exception.

Wait, perhaps D: can lead to an increase in voter turnout.

Is that true? I'm not sure. Maybe if districts are drawn to be more competitive, it could increase turnout, but gerrymandering often creates safe districts, which might reduce competition and thus turnout. Alternatively, if a district is packed with your supporters, maybe they feel more confident their vote counts, so they turn out. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe D is true because when districts are designed to include more of a certain group, they might feel more motivated to vote.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the other options.

Option E: divide like-minded voters into several districts to reduce their influence. Wait, no—gerrymandering usually packs them into one district to concentrate their votes, or spreads them to dilute. So if you divide like-minded voters into several districts, it would dilute their influence, making E a true statement. So E is correct.

Option F: increase districts with minority voters. Yes, that's a known strategy, so F is true.

Option G: allowed by Supreme Court in some instances. Yes, for example, in cases where it's not racial gerrymandering. So G is true.

So the exception has to be either A, B, D, or H.

I think the most straightforward answer is A: it's not universally disallowed. So the answer is A.
