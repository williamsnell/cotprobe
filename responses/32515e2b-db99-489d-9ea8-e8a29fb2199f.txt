Question:

Which of the following causes female pseudohermaphroditism?

Options:

A: Klinefelter syndrome
B: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
C: Graves' disease
D: Turner syndrome
E: Campomelic dysplasia
F: Androgen insensitivity
G: Noonan syndrome
H: Marfan syndrome
I: Prader-Willi syndrome

Answer:

Okay, so I need to figure out which condition causes female pseudohermaphroditism. Let me start by recalling what pseudohermaphroditism means. From what I remember, pseudohermaphroditism is when an individual has ambiguous genitalia but their chromosomes and internal reproductive organs don't match the external appearance. In female pseudohermaphroditism, the person has XX chromosomes but appears more masculine.

Looking at the options:

A: Klinefelter syndrome – I think that's XXY and affects males, causing infertility and possibly some feminine traits, so probably not this.

B: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) – I remember that CAH leads to excess androgens because the adrenal glands are overactive. In females, this can cause ambiguous genitalia, which fits with pseudohermaphroditism.

C: Graves' disease – That's a thyroid issue, hyperthyroidism, which I don't think relates to sexual development.

D: Turner syndrome – That's X chromosome monosomy, leading to female infertility and other features, but not pseudohermaphroditism.

E: Campomelic dysplasia – I think this is a skeletal disorder, more about the spine and limbs, not directly related to sexual ambiguity.

F: Androgen insensitivity – Wait, androgen insensitivity is when the body doesn't respond to androgens. So the person is genetically XY but can't develop male characteristics, leading to female external genitalia despite having testes internally. That's more male pseudohermaphroditism, not female.

G: Noonan syndrome – I believe this affects multiple systems, like heart defects and facial features, but not specifically genital ambiguity.

H: Marfan syndrome – That's about connective tissue, leading to tall stature and eye issues, not related.

I: Prader-Willi syndrome – This is about obesity, intellectual disability, and other issues, not sexual development.

So, the correct answer should be B: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia because it causes the body to produce excess androgens in females, leading to ambiguous genitalia and pseudohermaphroditism.

The correct answer is B: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia. This condition causes the body to produce excess androgens, leading to ambiguous genitalia in females, which is characteristic of female pseudohermaphroditism.

Answer: B
