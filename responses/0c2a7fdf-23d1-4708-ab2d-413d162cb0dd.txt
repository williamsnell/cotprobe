Okay, so I've got this problem here about four friends who started a business remodeling and selling old cars. The question is asking how many cars they need to sell at $1,440 each to make a gross profit of $7,000. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what gross profit means. From what I remember, gross profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of goods sold (COGS) from the revenue generated. So, the formula would be Gross Profit = Revenue - COGS.

In this case, the revenue comes from selling the cars. They're selling each car for $1,440. So, if they sell 'n' cars, the revenue would be 1,440 * n.

Now, the COGS includes the cost of purchasing the cars and the materials used to remodel them. They bought each car for $250 from a dealer, and it costs another $410 in materials per car. So, the total cost per car is 250 + 410. Let me add those up: 250 + 410 = 660. So, each car they remodel costs them $660.

But wait, there's also the fixed cost of renting the barn for the summer, which is $600. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Is this rent part of the COGS or a fixed expense? I think COGS refers to the variable costs directly related to producing each unit, so the rent might be a fixed cost, not included in COGS. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

The problem says "gross profit," which usually doesn't include fixed costs like rent. Gross profit is more about the profit from the product before other expenses. So, maybe the rent is a fixed expense that would come after gross profit. Therefore, when calculating gross profit, we might not include the rent in the COGS. But I'm not 100% certain. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem states that they paid $600 to rent a barn. It doesn't specify whether this is a monthly or per-car cost. Since it's for the summer, perhaps it's a one-time fixed cost for the entire period, regardless of how many cars they sell. So, maybe this $600 isn't part of the COGS but is an operating expense. Therefore, when calculating gross profit, which is revenue minus COGS, the rent might not be subtracted. Instead, the rent would be considered after gross profit. Hmm, this is a bit tricky.

But wait, the problem is asking for a gross profit of $7,000. So, perhaps the rent is included in the COGS? Or maybe not. Let me clarify.

If the rent is a fixed cost, then it's part of the total costs but not variable costs. So, when calculating gross profit, which is based on variable costs, the rent might not be included. Alternatively, sometimes businesses include fixed costs in their break-even calculations, but for gross profit, it's usually just revenue minus variable costs.

Wait, but the problem says "gross profit." Let me recall: Gross profit is total revenue minus the direct costs of producing the goods, not including fixed costs. So, in this case, the $600 rent is a fixed cost and wouldn't be part of the COGS for gross profit. Therefore, the COGS per car is just $660 (250 + 410).

So, the gross profit per car would be the selling price minus the COGS. Selling price is $1,440, COGS is $660. So, 1,440 - 660 = 780. Each car sold gives them a gross profit of $780.

Now, they want a gross profit of $7,000. So, how many cars do they need to sell? That would be the total desired gross profit divided by the gross profit per car. So, 7,000 divided by 780.

Let me calculate that: 7,000 ÷ 780. Let's see, 780 goes into 7,000 how many times? 780*8=6,240. Subtract that from 7,000: 7,000 - 6,240 = 760. Then, 780 goes into 760 about 0.97 times. So, 8.97 cars. But you can't sell a fraction of a car, so they need to sell 9 cars to reach the desired gross profit. But wait, 9 cars would give a gross profit of 9 * 780 = 7,020, which is just over $7,000. But let me double-check my math.

Wait, maybe I did the division wrong. Let me try 7,000 divided by 780. 780 times 8 is 6,240. 780 times 9 is 7,020, which is 7,020. So, 9 cars would give them $7,020, which is more than the $7,000 they want. But do they need to reach exactly $7,000, or at least $7,000? The question says "obtain a gross profit of $7,000," so they need at least $7,000. Therefore, 9 cars would suffice because 9 * 780 = 7,020, which is more than 7,000. But wait, the options don't have 9 as the correct answer. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are A:12, B:15, C:11, D:7, E:16, F:13, G:8, H:9, I:10, J:14.

H is 9, which would be the answer if my calculation is correct. But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Because the rent is a fixed cost, perhaps it should be included in the calculation. Let me try that approach.

If the rent is considered a fixed cost, then the total costs would be the fixed cost plus the variable costs. So, total cost = 600 + (250 + 410)*n. But wait, no, because gross profit is calculated as revenue minus variable costs. So, fixed costs are usually not part of COGS for gross profit. So, the initial approach was correct, and 9 cars would give a gross profit of $7,020. But 9 is one of the options, H. However, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the gross profit per car. Selling price is $1,440. COGS per car is 250 + 410 = 660. So, 1,440 - 660 = 780 per car. Correct.

Number of cars needed: 7,000 / 780 ≈ 8.97. So, 9 cars. But perhaps the problem expects the fixed cost to be included in the COGS. If that's the case, then total COGS would be 600 + (250 + 410)*n.

Wait, but that would make the COGS variable per car plus the fixed rent. So, gross profit would be revenue minus (600 + (250 + 410)*n). But that's not standard because fixed costs are not part of COGS for gross profit. But maybe in this problem's context, they consider the rent as part of the total costs, so gross profit would be revenue minus all costs, including fixed. Let me try that approach.

If that's the case, then gross profit = revenue - total costs = (1440 * n) - (600 + 660 * n). They want this to be $7,000.

So, (1440n) - (600 + 660n) = 7000.

Simplify this equation:

1440n - 600 - 660n = 7000.

Combine like terms:

(1440n - 660n) - 600 = 7000.

780n - 600 = 7000.

Add 600 to both sides:

780n = 7600.

Now, divide both sides by 780:

n = 7600 / 780 ≈ 9.743.

So, approximately 9.74 cars. Since you can't sell a fraction, they'd need to sell 10 cars to reach at least $7,000 gross profit. But wait, let's check this calculation again.

Wait, 7600 ÷ 780. Let me compute that more accurately.

780 * 9 = 7,020, which is more than 7,600? Wait, no. Wait, 780 * 9 = 7,020. 780 * 10 = 7,800. So, 7600 is between 9*780 and 10*780.

Wait, 780*9=7,020. 780*9.743≈7,600.

Wait, 780 * 9 = 7,020. 7,600 - 7,020 = 580. 580 / 780 ≈ 0.743. So, 9.743 cars. So, you'd need to sell 10 cars to reach the required gross profit when including the rent in the COGS.

But this approach depends on whether the rent is included in the COGS for gross profit. If it's included, then the answer is 10, which is option I. If not, it's 9, option H. But I'm a bit confused because I thought gross profit doesn't include fixed costs. Let me confirm.

Looking it up, gross profit is calculated as (Sales - Cost of Goods Sold). COGS typically includes direct costs like materials and labor, not fixed costs like rent. So, in this case, the rent is a fixed expense and is not part of COGS. Therefore, the initial approach was correct, and the gross profit is based only on the variable costs per car.

So, going back to the first calculation: each car contributes $780 to gross profit. To reach $7,000, they need to sell 7,000 / 780 ≈ 8.97 cars, which rounds up to 9 cars. So, the answer would be H:9.

But wait, looking at the options, H is 9. But let me check the math again to be sure. 9 cars * $780 = $7,020. They need $7,000, so 9 cars would give them a little more than needed. That seems correct.

Wait, but the options also include 10, which is I. Did I make a mistake in the initial calculation? Let me check the per-car gross profit again.

Selling price: $1,440.

COGS per car: $250 (purchase) + $410 (materials) = $660.

So, 1,440 - 660 = $780 per car.

Yes, that's correct.

So, 7,000 / 780 ≈ 8.97. So, 9 cars needed.

Therefore, the correct answer should be H:9. But wait, let me check the options again. The options are A:12, B:15, C:11, D:7, E:16, F:13, G:8, H:9, I:10, J:14.

So, H is 9, which would be the answer. But wait, maybe I'm missing something else. Let me think about whether the rent is included or not. Because if the rent is a fixed cost, then the gross profit is just 780n, and they need 780n >=7,000. So, n=9 gives 7,020, which is acceptable.

But perhaps the problem expects the rent to be included in the gross profit. Let me try that approach again.

If gross profit is revenue minus all costs, including rent, then:

Gross Profit = (1440n) - (600 + 660n) = 7000.

So, 1440n -600 -660n =7000.

That's 780n -600=7000.

780n=7600.

n=7600/780 ≈9.743, so 10 cars.

So, if the problem includes the rent in the COGS, the answer is I:10. But if not, it's H:9.

I'm a bit torn here. Let me read the problem statement again.

The problem says: "How many automobiles must the students sell at $1,440 each to obtain a gross profit of $7,000?"

It mentions that they paid $600 to rent a barn. So, that's an expense they incurred. Now, in accounting terms, gross profit is calculated as (Revenue - COGS). COGS includes the cost of goods sold, which in this case would be the cost of the cars plus remodeling materials. The rent is a fixed expense and is not part of COGS; it's an operating expense. Therefore, the correct way is to calculate gross profit as revenue minus (250 + 410)*n.

So, the rent is a fixed cost, and gross profit is 1440n -660n=780n. So, they need 780n=7000, n=7000/780≈8.97, so 9 cars.

Therefore, the answer is H:9.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident because sometimes in small businesses, fixed costs are included in the break-even analysis, but for gross profit, it's usually just the variable costs. So, I think the correct approach is to not include the rent in the COGS for gross profit. So, the answer is H:9.

But looking at the options, H is 9, which would be the answer if we don't include the rent. Alternatively, if we do include the rent, it's 10, which is I. But I'm more confident now that the rent isn't part of the COGS for gross profit, so the answer should be H:9.

To determine how many automobiles the students must sell to achieve a gross profit of $7,000, we first calculate the gross profit per car. The selling price per car is $1,440, and the cost of goods sold (COGS) per car is $250 (purchase cost) + $410 (materials) = $660. Therefore, the gross profit per car is:

\[
1,440 - 660 = 780
\]

Next, we need to find the number of cars (\(n\)) required to reach a gross profit of $7,000. This is calculated as:

\[
780 \times n = 7,000
\]

Solving for \(n\):

\[
n = \frac{7,000}{780} \approx 8.97
\]

Since they cannot sell a fraction of a car, they need to sell 9 cars to achieve a gross profit of at least $7,000. Thus, the correct answer is:

H: 9

Answer: H
