Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Stevenson and his view on the word "good." The question is asking what the pleasing emotive meaning of "good" fits it for, and the options are from A to J. 

I remember that Stevenson was a philosopher who talked about the nature of ethical terms. He had something to say about how words like "good" function. I think he discussed whether these terms are descriptive, prescriptive, or something else. 

From what I recall, Stevenson believed that ethical terms like "good" aren't just describing facts. Instead, they have emotive meaning. So when someone says something is good, they're not just stating a fact but also expressing approval or disapproval. This makes me think that the emotive meaning is tied to how we use the word in communication, not just to describe things.

Looking at the options, I see "expressive use" as option E. That sounds right because if the word has an emotive meaning, it's being used to express feelings rather than describe something. Other options like "descriptive use" (B) might be more about stating facts, which Stevenson didn't think "good" does. "Evaluative use" (F) is close, but I think evaluative might imply a more objective judgment, whereas Stevenson's point was about the emotive, expressive aspect.

So putting it together, Stevenson's idea aligns with the word "good" being used expressively to convey approval or emotion rather than to describe or evaluate in a factual sense.
