Okay, so I need to figure out what Fascism is as an economic system. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, I remember that Fascism is a political ideology that became prominent in the 20th century, especially in Europe with leaders like Mussolini in Italy. But how does that translate into an economic system?

I know that Fascism is often contrasted with both capitalism and socialism. Capitalism is all about private ownership and free markets, while socialism involves more government control or collective ownership. But Fascism seems different from both. 

From what I've heard, Fascist economies aren't purely capitalist or purely socialist. They have elements of both. So, the state probably has a significant role, but it's not as extreme as in socialism or communism. I think the government in a fascist system would control key industries, maybe like defense or utilities, but allow private businesses to operate in other sectors. That way, it's a mix of state control and private enterprise.

Looking at the options:

Option A says fascism promotes a mixed economy where the state owns some means of production, but there's significant private enterprise. That sounds familiar. It combines state and private elements.

Option B says it's similar to communist systems with complete state ownership. I don't think that's right because fascism isn't the same as communism. Communist systems have all production owned by the state, but fascism allows some private businesses.

Option C mentions retaining capitalist institutions but with extensive government control. That also aligns with what I know. Fascism keeps the capitalist structure (like businesses, markets) but adds a lot of regulation and control from the government.

Option D talks about worker collectives managing production. That sounds more like socialism or maybe syndicalism, not fascism.

Option E is about laissez-faire with minimal government intervention. That's more capitalism, which fascism isn't. Fascism has a lot of government involvement.

Option F says it's purely capitalist, which I don't think is correct because fascism involves more state control than pure capitalism.

Option G is an anarchic system without government control. That's the opposite of fascism, which actually has strong government control.

Option H promotes free trade and open markets. I don't recall fascism being particularly known for that. In fact, some fascist regimes might have been protectionist or isolationist in their economic policies.

Option I is about universal basic income and wealth redistribution. That's more in line with socialist or welfare state policies, not specifically fascism.

Option J says fascism is a form of socialist economy. While both involve some state control, socialism typically implies more collective ownership, whereas fascism allows for private enterprise alongside state control.

So, considering all this, I think the correct answer combines some state ownership with private enterprise. That would be Option A. But wait, Option C also seems plausible because it talks about retaining capitalist institutions but with regulation. 

I need to clarify: Fascism is more about having a strong central authority that controls the economy but allows private businesses to function under state supervision. So it's a mixed economy, which is Option A. Alternatively, Option C is about retaining capitalist forms but with government control, which is also a part of it.

Hmm, which one is more accurate? I think Option A is better because it directly mentions the mixed nature of the economy, with state owning some production and significant private enterprise. Option C is also correct in that the institutions are capitalist but controlled, but the key point is the mix of state and private sectors.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Fascism is known for having a strong state that directs the economy, often through government control and regulation. It allows private businesses to exist but subordinates them to state interests. So, the economy isn't entirely state-run (like socialism) nor entirely free market (like capitalism). It's a middle ground where the state has a big role but doesn't own everything.

So, Option A says it's a mixed economy with state owning some means and private enterprise. That fits. Option C says it retains capitalist institutions but with government control. That's also true but maybe more about the structure rather than the ownership mix.

I think both A and C have correct elements, but the question is about the economic system. The economic system aspect would focus more on ownership, so Option A is more precise in describing the economic structure as a mix of state and private.

The correct answer is A. Fascism as an economic system is characterized by a mixed economy where the state owns some means of production, but there is also significant private enterprise. This aligns with the understanding that fascism combines elements of state control with private enterprise, creating a mixed economic structure.
