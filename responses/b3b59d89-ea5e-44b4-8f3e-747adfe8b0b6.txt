Question:

Discuss cognitive development during adolescence as describedby Piaget.

Options:

A: The stage of formal operations begins at about the age of 11 when the child begins to think abstractly, hypothetically, and idealistically.
B: Cognitive development peaks in early adolescence and declines thereafter.
C: Cognitive development during adolescence is marked by a return to sensory-motor thinking.
D: Cognitive development begins in adolescence.
E: Cognitive development ends with the stage of formal operations.
F: Adolescents revert to egocentric thinking patterns that are typical of early childhood.
G: The stage of formal operations is only reached by a minority of individuals, with most never advancing beyond concrete operations.
H: The stage of formal operations is achieved by all individuals by the age of 8.
I: Cognitive development is characterized by the ability to deal with concrete situations.
J: Adolescents primarily focus on developing practical skills rather than abstract thinking.

Okay, so I have this question about Piaget's theory of cognitive development during adolescence. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Piaget's stages are well-known. Let me recall: he proposed four stages. The first is the sensorimotor stage, which is from birth to about 2 years. Then comes the preoperational stage, which is roughly 2 to 7 years. Next is the concrete operational stage, around 7 to 11 years. And finally, the formal operational stage, which starts around 11 or 12 and continues into adulthood.

The question is about cognitive development during adolescence as described by Piaget. Adolescence typically starts around 11 or 12, so that aligns with the formal operational stage. In this stage, according to Piaget, individuals develop the ability to think abstractly, reason hypothetically, and handle more complex problems. They can think about possibilities, use logic, and understand more abstract concepts like algebra or philosophy.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the formal operations stage begins at about 11. That seems right because Piaget's formal stage starts around that age. So A is a contender.

Option B claims cognitive development peaks in early adolescence and declines. I don't think Piaget said that. Cognitive development continues beyond adolescence, so B is probably wrong.

Option C suggests a return to sensory-motor thinking. That doesn't make sense because as you move through stages, you don't regress. So C is incorrect.

Option D says cognitive development begins in adolescence. No, cognitive development starts from birth. Adolescence is just one stage after others, so D is wrong.

Option E states that cognitive development ends with formal operations. Well, Piaget thought formal operations were the final stage, but some later theories suggest more stages. However, the question is about Piaget, so E could be correct if it's an endpoint, but I think E is more about the stages ending with formal operations, which is accurate.

Option F says adolescents revert to egocentric thinking. Egocentric is a feature of the preoperational stage, not formal. So F is wrong.

Option G claims only a minority reach formal operations. I don't think Piaget said that. Most people reach formal operations, though maybe not all. So G is probably wrong.

Option H says formal operations are achieved by age 8. No, that's too early. It starts around 11, so H is incorrect.

Option I says cognitive development is about dealing with concrete situations. That's the concrete operational stage, not formal. So I is wrong.

Option J says adolescents focus on practical skills. That doesn't fit because formal operations are about abstract thinking, not just practical. So J is incorrect.

So between A and E. The question is about discussing cognitive development during adolescence. Piaget's formal operations start at about 11, which is during adolescence. So A describes the onset of that stage. E says cognitive development ends with formal operations, which is true in Piaget's model. But the question is about what happens during adolescence, not the endpoint.

Wait, the question is to discuss cognitive development during adolescence as per Piaget. Adolescence is when formal operations begin. So A correctly describes the start of that stage.

Therefore, the correct answer should be A.

The correct answer is **A**, as it accurately describes the onset of the formal operational stage during adolescence, which is when cognitive development involves abstract and hypothetical thinking according to Piaget.

Answer: A
