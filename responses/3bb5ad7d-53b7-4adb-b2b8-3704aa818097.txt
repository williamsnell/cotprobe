Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that Tiger Woods buys a golf ball in England for $1. The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) in England is 0.75. The question is asking what the total increase in England's real GDP resulting from this purchase would be. The options are A through J, with various dollar amounts.

Hmm, I remember that MPC is the fraction of additional income that is spent on consumption. So, MPC of 0.75 means that for every extra dollar someone earns, they spend 75 cents of it. This ties into the concept of the multiplier effect, right? Because when someone spends money, that money gets circulated through the economy, leading to a larger overall effect.

Wait, but wait a second. In this case, Tiger Woods is buying a product in England. So, the initial spending is $1. But how does this translate into an increase in GDP? I think the key here is the multiplier effect. The formula for the multiplier is 1/(1 - MPC). So, if MPC is 0.75, then the multiplier would be 1/(1 - 0.75) = 1/0.25 = 4. That means each dollar spent leads to a 4 times increase in GDP.

So, if Tiger spends $1, the total increase in GDP would be $1 multiplied by 4, which is $4. Looking at the options, that's option F.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing up anything. The MPC is given, so the marginal propensity to save would be 1 - MPC, which is 0.25. The multiplier formula is indeed 1 divided by the marginal propensity to save. So yes, 1/0.25 is 4. Therefore, the total increase is $1 * 4 = $4.

I don't think it's any other option because, for example, option A is $6, which would be if the MPC was 0.8 (1/(1-0.8)=5, 1*5=5, but that's not the case here). Option B is $3, which might come from 1/(1-0.75) being 4, but maybe someone thought MPC is the multiplier itself, which would be wrong. Option E is $1.25, which is less than 4, so that doesn't fit. The correct calculation is definitely $4, so the answer should be F.

The correct answer is F: $4. The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is 0.75, so the multiplier is 1/(1-0.75) = 4. The $1 purchase leads to a total increase in GDP of $1 * 4 = $4.

The last character of my response must be the letter I have chosen.
