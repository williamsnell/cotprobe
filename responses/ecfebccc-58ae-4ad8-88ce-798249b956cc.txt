Okay, so I need to figure out which option correctly answers the question: "Older workers are more likely to..." The options are A through J, each describing a different behavior or outcome. 

First, I'll think about what I know regarding older workers in the workforce. I remember reading that older employees often have more experience, which can make them more reliable and efficient. But I'm not sure about their likelihood of being absent or having workplace accidents. I think younger people might be more prone to accidents because they're less experienced, but I'm not certain.

Option D says older workers are less likely to learn new technology. I've heard that some people think older workers are resistant to new tech, but I also know many older adults who are tech-savvy. So, maybe this isn't a given.

Option E suggests they're less innovative. I'm not sure. Innovation can come from all age groups, but sometimes people assume younger workers are more innovative because they're more familiar with the latest trends. However, older workers might bring different perspectives that can be innovative too.

Option F is about being resistant to change. I think change can be hard for anyone, regardless of age, but older workers might have more established routines, making them more resistant. But I'm not entirely sure if this is more likely for them than others.

Option G says they're more likely to be laid off. I think during economic downturns, sometimes older workers might be let go because companies might prefer to hire younger, cheaper labor. But I'm not certain if this is a general trend or just in specific situations.

Option H is about retiring early. I know some older workers do retire early if they can afford it, but not all. So this might not be the best answer because it's not a certainty.

Option I says they're less motivated. I don't think age directly correlates with motivation. Some older workers might be motivated because they have more experience or are saving for retirement, while others might feel less motivated if they're not challenged.

Option J suggests they're dissatisfied with their jobs. Again, job satisfaction varies, and I don't think age is the main factor here. Some older workers might be satisfied, others not, depending on their situation.

So, considering all this, I'm trying to eliminate options. A says they're more likely to be absent. I think younger workers might have more absences due to family issues or other reasons, but I'm not sure about older workers. B says more prone to accidents. I'm leaning towards B because as people age, physical conditions might make workplace accidents more likely, especially in jobs requiring physical labor. Plus, older workers might be less agile, increasing accident risks. 

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. I should think again. Are older workers really more accident-prone? Or is it that younger, less experienced ones are? I think younger workers might have more on-the-job injuries because they're learning and might take more risks. So maybe B isn't correct. 

If B isn't right, what else? Option D about new technology. Maybe older workers are less likely to adopt new tech, but I'm not sure. I think it's more about willingness and training opportunities. Some older workers can adapt, others might resist, but it's not a given that all do.

Option F, resistant to change. I think change is harder for everyone, but older workers might have more set ways, making them more resistant. But I'm not certain if this is the most likely answer.

Another angle: looking at studies or common perceptions. I've heard that older workers are often seen as more reliable and less likely to be absent. So option A might not be correct. They might not be as absent as younger workers who have more family responsibilities or health issues.

If I consider the options, which one is most commonly associated with older workers? I think the stereotype is that older workers are less likely to adapt to new technologies and changes, making options D and F possible. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, some studies suggest that older workers are more experienced and thus more productive, which would make options C and I incorrect. So, less likely to be less productive. 

Wait, the question is about what older workers are more likely to do. So, looking again, I think the correct answer is F: Be resistant to change. Because older workers might have more established ways of doing things and be less open to new methods. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, it might be D: Be less likely to learn new technology, as that's a common stereotype.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn between D and F. But I think the more accurate answer is F: Be resistant to change. Because change can be harder for anyone as they get older, not just in the workplace but in general. So I'll go with F.

The answer is F: Be resistant to change.
