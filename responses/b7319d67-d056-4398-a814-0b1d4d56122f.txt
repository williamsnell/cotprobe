Okay, so I need to figure out where seminal fluid is produced in a man. Let me think about what I know. Seminal fluid is the fluid that's part of semen, right? I remember that semen is made up of sperm and seminal fluid. 

I think the main parts involved are the testes, but wait, the testes produce sperm, not the fluid. Oh, right, the testes produce sperm, and then other glands add the fluid. So, I'm pretty sure the seminal vesicles are part of it. I've heard the term 'seminal vesicles' before, they must be where some of the fluid comes from.

Then there's the prostate gland. I remember that the prostate is below the bladder and contributes to the seminal fluid too. The prostate's role is to add some components to the semen to make it more viable. 

Also, Cowper's glands, sometimes called bulbourethral glands, are involved. These glands secrete a clear fluid that makes up part of the pre-ejaculate, which helps lubricate the urethra and neutralize any acidity. This probably also contributes to the seminal fluid.

So putting it all together, the seminal fluid is produced by the paired seminal vesicles, the prostate gland, and Cowper's glands. Let me double-check the options. Option D says exactly that: paired seminal vesicles, prostate gland, and Cowper's glands. That sounds right.

I should make sure none of the other options are correct. The thyroid, bladder, pituitary, pancreas, liver, epididymis, urethra, adrenal glands, and testesâ€”no, those don't make sense. The testes produce sperm, not the fluid. The rest are other organs that aren't directly involved in producing seminal fluid.

The correct answer is D: Seminal fluid is produced by the paired seminal vesicles, the prostate gland, and Cowper's glands in man.

The process involves the seminal vesicles contributing most of the seminal fluid, the prostate gland adding additional components, and Cowper's glands providing a lubricating fluid. 

Answer: D
