Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the concentration of OH- ions in a 1.0 molar solution of NH4OH. The ionization constant given is 1.8 × 10^-5. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but I'll try to think it through.

First off, I remember that NH4OH is ammonium hydroxide, which is a weak base. When it ionizes in water, it should dissociate into NH4+ and OH- ions. The ionization equation should look like NH4OH ↔ NH4+ + OH-.

The ionization constant, Kb, is given as 1.8e-5. Wait, Kb is the base dissociation constant, right? So Kb equals [NH4+][OH-] divided by [NH4OH]. But since the solution is 1.0 M, and the ionization is not very strong (because Kb is small), the change in concentration of NH4OH should be negligible. So I can approximate [NH4OH] as approximately 1.0 M.

Let me set up the variables. Let x be the concentration of OH- ions produced. Then, [NH4+] would also be x, and [NH4OH] would be roughly 1.0 - x. But since Kb is small, x should be much smaller than 1, so 1.0 - x ≈ 1.0. That simplifies things.

So the equation becomes Kb ≈ x^2 / 1.0. Solving for x, x = sqrt(Kb) = sqrt(1.8e-5). Let me calculate that. The square root of 1.8 is about 1.34, and the square root of 1e-5 is 1e-2.5, which is 3.16e-3. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. 1e-5 is 10^-5, so the square root is 10^(-5/2)=10^-2.5, which is approximately 3.16e-3. So 1.34 times 3.16e-3 equals about... let me multiply 1.34 * 3.16. 1 times 3 is 3, 1 times 0.16 is 0.16, 0.34 times 3 is 1.02, 0.34 times 0.16 is around 0.0544. Adding up: 3 + 0.16 = 3.16, plus 1.02 is 4.18, plus 0.0544 is 4.2344. So approximately 4.234e-3. Wait, but that would be x, the [OH-], right?

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 4.2e-3, which matches my calculation. But wait, I should double-check. Did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me confirm the Kb value. Oh wait, wait. Wait a second. NH4OH is a base, so it's being ionized in water, but sometimes I might confuse Kb with Kw when dealing with acids. No, Kb is correct here because it's a base. So the approach is right.

Wait another thing: the initial assumption that x is much smaller than 1.0. Let's see, x is around 4e-3, which is 0.004, and 1.0 is 1.0. So 0.4% of 1.0, which is definitely much smaller, so the approximation holds. So x is indeed approximately 4.2e-3.

Looking at the options, option E is 4.2 ×10^-3. So that's the answer. Wait, but let me check the other options to make sure I didn't miss anything. Option D is 9e-4, which is smaller, but my calculation gives 4.2e-3. Option G is 1.2e-3, which is much smaller. Options A, B, etc., don't match. So yeah, option E seems correct.

The ionization constant (Kb) for NH4OH is given as 1.8 × 10^-5. NH4OH dissociates in water as NH4OH ↔ NH4+ + OH-. Let x represent the concentration of OH- ions produced. Using the expression for Kb:

\[
K_b = \frac{[NH_4^+][OH^-]}{[NH_4OH]}
\]

Since the solution is 1.0 M and Kb is small, [NH4OH] ≈ 1.0 M. Thus, the equation simplifies to:

\[
K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{1.0}
\]

Solving for x:

\[
x = \sqrt{K_b} = \sqrt{1.8 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 4.2 \times 10^{-3}
\]

Thus, the concentration of OH- ions is approximately 4.2 × 10^-3 M, which corresponds to option E.
