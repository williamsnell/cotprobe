Okay, so I have this question about nearsightedness, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through this step by step.

First, what do I know about nearsightedness, also called myopia? I remember that it's a common eye condition where a person can see things clearly up close but has difficulty seeing things that are far away. So, the problem lies in how the eye focuses light.

I think the eye has several parts that help focus light: the cornea, the lens, and the retina. The cornea is the clear outer part, and it bends the light as it enters the eye. Then, the lens fine-tunes that focusing. The retina is where the light hits at the back of the eye, and it's responsible for creating the image that gets sent to the brain.

In a normal eye, the cornea and lens bend light so that it focuses precisely on the retina. But in a nearsighted eye, I believe the focus point is in front of the retina instead of directly on it. So the image is blurry because it's not hitting the right spot.

Why does this happen? I think it's related to the shape of the eye or the curvature of the focusing structures. If the eye is too long from front to back, that could cause the light to focus too soon, in front of the retina. Alternatively, if the cornea is too curved or the lens is too strong in curvature, that might also cause the light to bend too much, leading to the focus point being too early.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: too little curvature of the cornea and lens. That would mean the eye doesn't bend the light enough, so the focus would be behind the retina, causing farsightedness (hyperopia), not nearsightedness. So this is probably not the right answer.

Option B: too much curvature of the retina and lens. Wait, the retina is at the back; its curvature isn't really adjustable like the cornea and lens. So maybe this isn't the right choice. Also, too much lens curvature would contribute, but the retina's curvature isn't something that changes, so I'm not sure about this one.

Option C: too much curvature of the cornea and lens. That sounds plausible. If both the cornea and lens are too curved, they bend the light too much, causing the focus to land in front of the retina. That would lead to nearsightedness.

Option D: too much curvature of the iris and cornea. The iris is the colored part, and while it does control the pupil size, its curvature isn't something that changes in a way that affects refraction like the cornea and lens do. So probably not D.

Option E: incorrect alignment of the cornea and retina. Alignment issues, like in astigmatism, affect the shape of the cornea, but nearsightedness is more about the overall focusing rather than alignment. Plus, the cornea and retina alignment being incorrect doesn't directly explain the focus point issue.

Option F: incorrect alignment of the cornea and lens. Hmm, alignment could affect focus. If they aren't aligned properly, maybe the light isn't focused correctly. But I'm not sure if this is the primary cause of nearsightedness. It feels more like a different issue, perhaps astigmatism or something else.

Option G: too much curvature of the iris and lens. Again, the iris's curvature isn't a major factor in refraction. So this might not be right.

Option H: incorrect alignment of the iris and lens. Similar to F, alignment issues, but I don't think this is the main cause of myopia.

Option I: too little curvature of the iris and lens. If the curvature was too little, it would lead to the eye focusing light less, possibly causing the focus to be too far back, which would be farsightedness, not nearsightedness.

Option J: too little curvature of the retina and lens. The retina's curvature isn't adjustable, so this doesn't make much sense. Plus, as with A, less curvature would cause the focus to be behind, which is hyperopia.

So, considering all this, the main issue in nearsightedness is that the eye focuses the light too much, causing the focal point to be in front of the retina. That points towards too much curvature in the structures responsible for bending the light, which are the cornea and the lens.

Looking at the options, C says too much curvature of the cornea and lens. That seems to fit. I think that's the correct answer.

The correct answer is C. Nearsightedness occurs when the cornea and lens have too much curvature, causing light to focus in front of the retina.

Answer: C
