Okay, so I have this question about the magnetic moment of 205Tl. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that the magnetic moment of an atom depends on its nuclear spin. For Tl-205, I think it's a spin-active isotope. Wait, Thallium has an atomic number of 81, right? So the electrons and protons add up to that. For Tl-205, the number of neutrons would be 205 - 81 = 124.

Wait, but how does that relate to magnetic moment? Oh right, the magnetic moment is due to the nuclear spin. The formula for magnetic moment (μ) is μ = ħ * γ * I, where I is the spin angular momentum. Alternatively, I've heard it expressed in terms of the gyromagnetic ratio γ.

Wait, I think the magnetic moment can also be calculated using the formula μ = g * μ_N * I, where g is the g-factor and μ_N is the nuclear magneton. But wait, for protons and neutrons, the g-factors are different. Let me recall: protons have a g-factor around 5.586, and neutrons around -3.826. But wait, that's for their individual contributions.

But wait, Tl-205 has a specific nuclear spin. I think 205Tl has a spin of I = ½. Oh wait, no, wait. Thallium-205's nuclear spin is I = ½. So the magnetic moment would depend on that.

Wait, but I might be mixing up the formulas. Another approach: the magnetic moment can be calculated using μ = (eħ)/(2m_p) * γ * I, which relates to the nuclear magneton. The nuclear magneton μ_N is (eħ)/(2m_p) * (g_p/2), where g_p is the proton's g-factor. Alternatively, I might be overcomplicating.

Wait, I think the formula is μ = γ * I, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. For the nucleus, γ for protons is about 267.5 × 10^6 rad T^-1 s^-1, and for neutrons it's about -12.7 × 10^6 rad T^-1 s^-1. But wait, for the nucleus, the total γ is a combination of protons and neutrons.

Wait, no, wait. The gyromagnetic ratio for a nucleus is given by γ = g * (e/(2m)) * (I), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the total magnetic moment can be found using the number of protons and neutrons and their respective g-factors.

Wait, but Tl-205 has 81 protons and 124 neutrons. So each proton contributes a certain amount and each neutron contributes another. So the total magnetic moment would be the sum of the contributions from each.

But wait, the formula for magnetic moment is μ = (g_p * μ_N * (p)) + (g_n * μ_N * (n)), where p is the number of protons and n the number of neutrons. Wait, μ_N is the nuclear magneton, which is a constant: about 5.0507837 × 10^-27 J/T.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. For a nucleus with I = ½, the magnetic moment is given by μ = g * μ_N * (I), where g is the overall g-factor. But for a nucleus, the g-factor isn't just a single value because it depends on the composition of protons and neutrons.

Wait, but wait, in the case of Tl-205, the spin is I = ½. So the magnetic moment would be μ = g * μ_N * (I), and I is ½. So μ = g * μ_N * ½.

Now, the g-factor for Tl-205... I think for Tl-205, the spin is I = ½ and the magnetic moment is positive, which suggests it's a proton-dominated isotope. Because neutrons have a negative g-factor.

Wait, the proton's g-factor is g_p = 5.586, and the neutron's is g_n = -3.826. So for Tl-205, with 81 protons and 124 neutrons, the effective g-factor would be (81 * g_p + 124 * g_n) / (81 + 124). Wait, but wait, that's the way to calculate the g-factor for the nucleus as a whole.

So let's compute that. 81 * 5.586 = let's see... 80 *5.586 is 446.88, plus 1*5.586 is 446.88+5.586=452.466. Now 124 * (-3.826) is... 120*(-3.826)= -459.12, and 4*(-3.826)= -15.304, so total is -459.12 -15.304 = -474.424.

Now sum these two: 452.466 (protons) + (-474.424) (neutrons) = 452.466 -474.424 = -21.958. Then divide by total nucleons, 205.

So g = -21.958 / 205 ≈ -0.1071.

Wait, but that's a very small g-factor. But wait, I'm not sure if this is the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the g-factor for Tl-205 is given as a known value, so maybe I should look it up. But since I can't do that right now, perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, another approach: the magnetic moment μ can be calculated using the formula μ = γ * I, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. For Tl-205, I think the gyromagnetic ratio γ is given as 1.569 × 10^8 T^-1 s^-1.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is [ɣ (205Tl) = 1.569 × 10^8 T^-1 s^-1, I = ½]. So the magnetic moment would be μ = γ * I.

So I = ½, so μ = 1.569e8 * ½ = 0.7845e8 T^-1 s^-1. Wait, but that's not matching any option directly. Alternatively, perhaps the magnetic moment is expressed in J/T.

Wait, but wait. Another formula: μ = γ * ħ * I. Because angular momentum is ħ * I, and γ is in rad T^-1 s^-1. So μ would have units of (rad T^-1 s^-1) * (J s) * (dimensionless) ) → J/T.

Wait, because ħ has units of J s. So let me compute that. γ is 1.569e8 T^-1 s^-1. ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s. I is ½.

So μ = γ * ħ * I = (1.569e8 T^-1 s^-1) * (1.0545718e-34 J s) * (½).

Calculating this: 1.569e8 * 1.0545718e-34 = approximately 1.569 * 1.0546 ≈ 1.653, and 1e8 * 1e-34 = 1e-26. So 1.653e-26, multiplied by ½ gives 0.8265e-26 J/T.

Looking at the options, option J is 0.827e-26 J T^-1. So that's very close. So the answer would be J.

Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me compute 1.569e8 * 1.0545718e-34 more accurately.

1.569 * 1.0545718 = let's compute:

1.5 * 1.0545718 = 1.5818577.

0.069 * 1.0545718 ≈ 0.0726.

So total is approximately 1.5818577 + 0.0726 ≈ 1.6544577.

Multiply by 1e8 * 1e-34 = 1e-26. So 1.6544577e-26, then multiplied by ½ gives 0.8272e-26 J/T, which is 0.827e-26 J T^-1. That matches option J exactly, which is 0.827e-26 J T^-1.

So the correct answer should be J.

The magnetic moment of 205Tl is calculated using the formula:

\[
\mu = \gamma \cdot \hbar \cdot I
\]

where:
- \(\gamma = 1.569 \times 10^8 \, \text{T}^{-1} \text{s}^{-1}\) (gyromagnetic ratio for 205Tl),
- \(\hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J s}\) (reduced Planck's constant),
- \(I = \frac{1}{2}\) (nuclear spin).

Substituting the values:

\[
\mu = (1.569 \times 10^8) \cdot (1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot \frac{1}{2}
\]

First, calculate the product of \(\gamma\) and \(\hbar\):

\[
1.569 \times 1.0545718 \approx 1.654 \quad \text{and} \quad 10^8 \cdot 10^{-34} = 10^{-26}
\]

So,

\[
\mu = 1.654 \times 10^{-26} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 0.827 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J T}^{-1}
\]

This matches option J.
