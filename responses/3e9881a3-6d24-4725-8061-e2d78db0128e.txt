Okay, so I've got this question about remote procedure calls, or RPCs. I'm a bit rusty on my computer science concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking which statement about RPCs is true, and the options are A to D. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says RPC is used to call procedures that are farther than 2^16 bytes away. Hmm, I remember that RPC is about calling procedures on a different machine, not just a different address in memory. Like, across the network or something. So maybe this is talking about the address space, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's more about the distance in terms of network hops rather than memory addresses. I'm not certain, but I think this might not be the correct statement.

Option B claims RPC cannot return a value. Wait, that doesn't sound right. I mean, procedures can return values, so why wouldn't RPC? RPC is supposed to allow a client to call a function on a server and get a return value. So B is probably false.

Option C says RPC cannot pass parameters by reference. Well, passing by reference is about whether you can modify the original data. RPC usually works by passing copies of data, especially since the data might be on a different machine. But wait, some RPC implementations might support passing pointers or references if the system supports it, like in certain languages or systems. So I'm not sure if C is entirely true. Maybe some RPC systems can pass by reference, so this statement might not always hold.

Option D states RPC cannot call procedures implemented in a different language. That doesn't make sense to me. RPC is all about allowing different systems to communicate, so the procedures could be in any language as long as there's a way to serialize the data. For example, a Java service can be called from a Python client using RPC. So D is definitely false.

Wait, going back to A: 2^16 bytes is 65,536 bytes, which is 64KB. So the idea is that RPC is for calling procedures that are beyond that distance in memory. But in reality, RPC is about remote calls, like across a network, not just in terms of memory addresses. So A might be referring to the idea that RPC is used when the procedure isn't in the local address space. So maybe A is correct because it's about the distance in terms of being on a different machine, not just a different part of memory.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. RPC doesn't really care about the physical distance in bytes; it's about the logical separation, like different processes or different machines. So the statement in A might not be accurate because it's not about the number of bytes but the location being remote. So maybe A is incorrect because RPC isn't specifically for addresses beyond 2^16 bytes; it's for any remote procedure.

Wait, another angle: in some systems, a 16-bit address can only go up to 64KB. So if a procedure is beyond that, you need a 32-bit address or more. But RPC is more about the communication protocol than the address space. So perhaps A is trying to say that RPC is used when the procedure isn't in the same address space, which is correct because RPC is for remote calls, which could be across processes or machines, hence beyond the local address space. So maybe A is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is A because it's about the distance in terms of address space, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

RPC is used when the procedure isn't in the same memory space. So if a system uses 16-bit addressing, the maximum address is 65535 bytes. If the procedure is beyond that, it's in a different address space, so RPC is needed. But this seems a bit of a stretch because RPC is more about different machines or different processes, not just the address space limitations.

Wait, but in some cases, RPC might be used for inter-process communication on the same machine, where the procedures are in a different address space. So maybe A is correct in that sense.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is A because it's the only statement that's true. Let me see:

- B is wrong because RPC can return values.
- C is wrong because some RPC systems can pass by reference, though it's less common.
- D is wrong because RPC allows calling procedures in different languages.

So the only possible correct option is A. Therefore, the answer is A.

The question asks which statement about remote procedure calls (RPCs) is true. Here's the analysis:

- **Option A**: RPC is used to call procedures with addresses farther than 2^16 bytes away. This refers to the concept of RPC being used for remote calls, which could be across processes or machines, hence beyond the local address space. While RPC isn't specifically about the number of bytes, it aligns with the idea of addressing remote procedures, making this statement plausible.
  
- **Option B**: RPC cannot return a value. This is incorrect because RPC allows a client to call a procedure on a server and receive a return value.

- **Option C**: RPC cannot pass parameters by reference. This is also incorrect because, while RPC typically passes copies of data, some implementations can support passing by reference if the system allows it.

- **Option D**: RPC cannot call procedures implemented in a different language. This is false because RPC facilitates communication across different systems and languages.

After evaluating all options, **A** is the most accurate statement about RPC.
