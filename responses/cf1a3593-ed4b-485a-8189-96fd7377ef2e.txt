Okay, so I've got this problem here about heat loss through an insulated steel tube. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my heat transfer, but let's try to break it down step by step. 

Alright, the problem states that the tube is 12 feet long, with a 4-inch diameter. It's insulated with a 1-inch thick layer of material that has a thermal conductivity of 0.05 Btu/hr-ft-°F. The inner surface of the insulation is at 500°F, and the outer surface is at 100°F. I need to find the radial rate of heat loss over the total length of the rod. The options are given from A to J, and I have to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that heat transfer through cylindrical walls can be calculated using the formula for steady-state heat conduction. The formula is Q/t = (2πL (T_i - T_o)) / (ln(r_o/r_i) * k), where Q/t is the heat transfer rate per unit time, L is the length, T_i is the inner temperature, T_o is the outer temperature, r_o and r_i are the outer and inner radii, and k is the thermal conductivity.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem mentions the tube is steel, but the insulation is around it. So the steel tube's diameter is 4 inches, and the insulation adds 1 inch on each side, making the outer diameter 6 inches. But I think the formula I need is for the insulation layer, not the steel itself. Because the steel's thermal conductivity isn't given, and the problem is about the heat loss through the insulation, so the steel can be considered as part of the inner boundary.

So the insulation has a thickness of 1 inch. Let me get the radii right. The inner radius of the insulation (r_i) would be half of the tube's diameter. The tube is 4 inches diameter, so r_i = 2 inches = 0.1667 feet because 1 inch is 1/12 ft, so 2 inches is 2/12 = 1/6 ≈ 0.1667 ft. The outer radius (r_o) is the inner radius plus the insulation thickness, so 2 + 1 = 3 inches. Converting that to feet, it's 3/12 = 0.25 ft.

Wait, but wait again. The insulation is 1 inch thick, so the outer radius is the inner radius plus 1 inch. So if the inner diameter is 4 inches, the inner radius is 2 inches. Adding 1 inch gives an outer radius of 3 inches, which is 0.25 ft. Right.

The thermal conductivity k is given as 0.05 Btu/hr-ft-°F. The length L is 12 ft.

The temperature difference ΔT is 500°F - 100°F = 400°F.

Now, plugging all these into the formula: Q/t = (2 * π * L * ΔT) / (ln(r_o/r_i) * k).

Let me calculate each part step by step.

First, calculate ln(r_o/r_i). r_o is 0.25 ft, r_i is 0.1667 ft. So r_o/r_i = 0.25 / 0.1667 ≈ 1.5. The natural log of 1.5 is approximately 0.4055.

Next, the numerator: 2 * π * L * ΔT. Let's compute that. 2 * π ≈ 6.2832. L is 12 ft. ΔT is 400°F. So 6.2832 * 12 = 75.3984, multiplied by 400 gives 75.3984 * 400 = 30,159.36.

The denominator is ln(r_o/r_i) * k, which is 0.4055 * 0.05. Let's compute that: 0.4055 * 0.05 ≈ 0.020275.

So Q/t = 30,159.36 / 0.020275. Let me do that division. 30,159.36 ÷ 0.020275 ≈ let's see, 30,159.36 / 0.02 is about 1,507,968, but since it's 0.020275, it's a bit higher denominator, so the result will be slightly lower. Let me calculate it more accurately.

Wait, 0.020275 is approximately 0.020275. So 30,159.36 ÷ 0.020275. Let me compute that:

Let me use a calculator approach. 

30,159.36 ÷ 0.020275 ≈ 

Well, 0.020275 is 2.0275e-2.

Alternatively, 30,159.36 ÷ 0.020275 = ?

Let me compute 30,159.36 / 0.020275.

Multiply numerator and denominator by 100,000 to eliminate decimals: 30,159.36 * 1e5 = 3,015,936,000. Denominator becomes 2027.5.

So 3,015,936,000 ÷ 2027.5 ≈ let's see, 3,015,936,000 ÷ 2000 is about 1,507,968. So but since denominator is 2027.5, it's a bit more, so perhaps around 1,488,000.

Wait, perhaps I should use a better approach. Let me use an approximate value:

0.020275 ≈ 0.020275.

So 30,159.36 ÷ 0.020275 ≈ 30,159.36 / 0.020275.

Let me compute 30,159.36 / 0.020275:

Divide 30,159.36 by 0.020275.

Well, 0.020275 * 1,486,000 ≈ 30,159.36?

Wait, perhaps better to use calculator steps:

Let me compute 30,159.36 ÷ 0.020275.

0.020275 * 1,486,000 = 0.020275 * 1,486,000.

Wait, perhaps I should just compute it directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me recheck the formula and calculations.

Wait, another approach: the formula is Q/t = (2πL (T_i - T_o)) / (ln(r_o/r_i) *k).

So:

2 * π ≈ 6.2832

L = 12 ft

ΔT = 400°F

ln(r_o/r_i) = ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055

k = 0.05 Btu/(hr·ft·°F)

So numerator: 6.2832 * 12 * 400 = ?

6.2832 * 12 = 75.3984

75.3984 * 400 = 30,159.36

Denominator: 0.4055 * 0.05 = 0.020275

So Q/t = 30,159.36 / 0.020275 ≈ ?

Let me compute this division.

Let me use approximate values. 30,159.36 / 0.020275 ≈ 30,159.36 / 0.02 = 1,507,968. But since 0.020275 is slightly larger than 0.02, the actual value will be a bit less than 1,507,968.

Alternatively, let me compute 0.020275 * 1,486,000 = ?

0.02 * 1,486,000 = 29,720

0.000275 *1,486,000 = approx 407.15

So total is 29,720 + 407.15 ≈ 30,127.15, which is close to 30,159.36. So 1,486,000 would give about 30,127, so the actual value would be around 1,486,000 plus a bit more.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 30,159.36 ÷ 0.020275.

Let me think in terms of how much is 0.020275 * x = 30,159.36.

x = 30,159.36 / 0.020275 ≈ ?

Using a calculator approach:

30,159.36 ÷ 0.020275 = (30,159.36 * 100000) ÷ (2027.5) ≈ 3,015,936,000 ÷ 2027.5 ≈

Let me compute 2027.5 * 1,486,000 = ?

Wait, perhaps I should use a different approach. Let me see:

Compute 30,159.36 ÷ 0.020275.

Let me write it as:

30,159.36 / 0.020275 = ?

I can write this as 30,159.36 * (1 / 0.020275) ≈ 30,159.36 * 49.323 ≈ because 1/0.020275 ≈ 49.323.

So 30,159.36 * 49.323 ≈ ?

Let me compute 30,000 *49.323 = 1,479,690.

159.36 *49.323 ≈ approx 159.36 *50 =7,968, minus 159.36 *0.677≈ 107. So approx 7,968 -107=7,861.

So total approx 1,479,690 +7,861 ≈ 1,487,551.

Wait, but that's an approximation. So around 1,487,551 Btu/hr.

Wait, but none of the options are that high. The highest option is C:5000, J:3720. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait a minute, this can't be right because the options are in the thousands, but my calculation is about 1.48 million. That's way off. So I must have made a mistake.

Let me go back and check my steps.

Ah! Oh no, I think I messed up the units. The radii were in feet, but perhaps I should have converted them to inches instead of feet? Or maybe I should have kept them in inches but consistent.

Wait, the formula requires the radii to be in the same units as the thermal conductivity's length unit. Thermal conductivity is given in Btu/hr-ft-°F, so the radii should be in feet.

Wait, but let me recheck the radii.

The inner radius of the insulation is the radius of the steel tube, which is 4 inches diameter, so 2 inches radius. Convert to feet: 2 inches = 2/12 = 1/6 ≈ 0.1667 ft.

The outer radius is the inner radius plus 1 inch (thickness of insulation). So 2 inches +1 inch =3 inches. Convert to feet: 3/12=0.25 ft.

So r_i =0.1667 ft, r_o=0.25 ft.

So the ratio r_o/r_i = 0.25 / 0.1667 ≈ 1.5. ln(1.5)=0.4055.

So that's correct.

Wait, but why is the calculated Q/t so high? Let me see the formula again.

Wait, the formula gives Q/t in Btu/hr. But maybe I messed up the formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should have used the diameter instead of radius? Let me think. No, the formula uses radii.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula. The formula for heat transfer through a cylindrical wall is correct, right?

Yes, the formula is correct. So perhaps I made a miscalculation in the arithmetic.

Let me recompute the division: 30,159.36 ÷ 0.020275.

Let me compute 0.020275 * 1,486,000 = 30,127.15 as before. So 30,159.36 is a bit higher than 30,127.15, so perhaps 1,486,000 + (32.21 / 0.020275) ≈ 1,486,000 + 1,588 ≈ 1,487,588.

Wait, but again, that's way higher than any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula is per unit length, so I shouldn't multiply by L. Wait no, the formula I used is already for the entire length.

Wait, the formula is Q/t = (2πΔT L)/(ln(r_o/r_i)k). So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I used the wrong units for the radii. Maybe I should have used inches instead of feet. Let me try that.

If I use radii in inches, then r_i =2 inches, r_o=3 inches. The formula would then be in Btu/hr if k is in Btu/hr-in-°F. But wait, the thermal conductivity is given as 0.05 Btu/hr-ft-°F. So if I use inches, I need to convert k to per inch.

Alternatively, perhaps I should convert the radii to feet, which I did, but perhaps I made a mistake in the formula elsewhere.

Wait, let me recompute the denominator: ln(r_o/r_i) *k.

ln(3/2)=0.4055, multiplied by 0.05 gives 0.020275. Correct.

Numerator: 2πLΔT=2*3.1416*12*400.

2*3.1416≈6.2832.

6.2832 *12=75.3984.

75.3984 *400=30,159.36.

So 30,159.36 divided by 0.020275.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 30,159.36 ÷ 0.020275.

Let me try this again with more accurate division.

Compute 30,159.36 / 0.020275.

Let me write it as 30,159.36 ÷ 0.020275 = ?

Let me compute 0.020275 * x = 30,159.36.

So x = 30,159.36 / 0.020275.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, I can write 30,159.36 divided by 0.020275 as:

(30,159.36 * 100000) / (2027.5) ≈ 3,015,936,000 / 2027.5 ≈

Now, 2027.5 goes into 3,015,936,000 how many times?

Well, 2027.5 * 1,486,000 = ?

2027.5 * 1,486,000 = 2027.5 *1,486,000.

Wait, but perhaps an easier way is to approximate:

2027.5 * 1,486,000 = ?

Wait, perhaps I can compute 2027.5 * 1,486,000:

2027.5 *1,486,000 = 2027.5 * 1.486e6.

But this seems time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I should check if my initial approach is correct, because the result seems way too high.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, another way to calculate: the formula gives Q/t in Btu/hr.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I used the correct formula. The formula for heat transfer in cylindrical coordinates is indeed Q/t = (2πL (T_i - T_o))/(ln(r_o/r_i) * k).

So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the steel tube, but that doesn't make sense because the steel's conductivity isn't given. So I think I did it right.

Wait, but maybe I should calculate the heat loss per unit length and then multiply by the total length. Wait no, because the formula I used already includes the length L=12 ft.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try to compute 30,159.36 divided by 0.020275.

Let me compute 30,159.36 / 0.020275.

Let me think of it as 30,159.36 ÷ 0.020275 = 30,159.36 * (1/0.020275) ≈ 30,159.36 * 49.323 ≈ ?

30,159.36 * 49.323.

Let me compute 30,000 *49.323 = 1,479,690.

159.36 *49.323 ≈ approx 159.36 *50 =7,968, minus 159.36*(0.677)= approx 107.5.

So 7,968 -107.5≈7,860.5.

Adding together: 1,479,690 +7,860.5≈1,487,550.5.

So Q/t≈1,487,550 Btu/hr. But the options are all in the thousands, like 4400, 5000, etc. So this can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is for the entire length, but the problem is only about the radial rate, not the total. Wait, the question says "radial rate of heat loss over the total length of the rod." Oh wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe it's the heat loss per unit length, but the problem says "over the total length," so the total heat loss would be per hour.

But 1.48 million Btu/hr is way beyond the options given. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the radii. Let me double-check.

The steel tube has a diameter of 4 inches, so radius is 2 inches. The insulation is 1 inch thick, so the outer radius is 3 inches. So in feet, that's 0.1667 ft and 0.25 ft, which is correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the thermal conductivity is given in W/m-K instead of Btu/hr-ft-°F, but no, the problem states it's 0.05 Btu/hr-ft-°F, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it using inches instead of feet, but then I need to adjust the units accordingly.

Let me try that. Let's convert everything to inches.

r_i = 2 inches, r_o=3 inches.

L =12 ft = 144 inches.

k=0.05 Btu/hr-ft-°F. Since 1 ft =12 inches, then k in per inch would be 0.05 *12 =0.6 Btu/hr-in-°F.

Now, the formula becomes:

Q/t = (2πL (T_i - T_o)) / (ln(r_o/r_i) *k) 

Plugging in:

2π *144 *400 / (ln(3/2)*0.6)

Compute each part:

2π≈6.2832.

6.2832 *144 ≈ 900.5376.

900.5376 *400 =360,215.04.

Denominator: ln(1.5)=0.4055, multiplied by 0.6 gives 0.2433.

So Q/t =360,215.04 /0.2433 ≈ ?

Compute 360,215.04 ÷0.2433.

Well, 0.2433 *1,480,000≈360,000 (since 0.2433*1,500,000=364,950, which is close to 360,215). So approximately 1,480,000 Btu/hr.

Again, this is way higher than the options. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula is per unit length, so I should compute it per foot and then multiply by the total length.

Wait, but I think I did that correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the entire length, which I did.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me think: the problem is about the radial rate of heat loss over the total length. So perhaps it's the heat loss per unit length, not the total. But the problem says "over the total length," so I think it's the total heat loss per hour.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the way I'm calculating the natural log. Let me check: ln(3/2) is indeed approximately 0.4055.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the formula I'm using is for a solid cylinder, but the steel tube might have a hollow core. Wait, but the problem says it's a steel tube, but the insulation is around it, so the steel's inner surface is at 500°F, and the outer surface is at 100°F. So the steel's conductivity isn't given, which implies that perhaps the heat loss is only through the insulation, and the steel is a perfect conductor or something. But the problem doesn't mention the steel's conductivity, so I think it's correct to model only the insulation's heat transfer.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the steel tube's thermal conductivity. But since it's not given, I think it's assumed that the steel is negligible, or that the heat transfer is only through the insulation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the heat flux at the inner surface and then multiply by the area.

Wait, another approach: the heat loss can also be calculated using the formula Q = (2πL (T_i - T_o))/(ln(r_o/r_i)/k).

Wait, perhaps I should compute the area and then use the formula Q = (T_i - T_o)/ (ln(r_o/r_i)/(2πL k)).

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to compute the formula again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula's denominator. Wait, the formula is:

Q/t = (2πL (T_i - T_o)) / (ln(r_o/r_i) * k)

So with the values:

2 * π *12 *400 = 30,159.36.

Denominator: ln(3/2)*0.05 =0.4055 *0.05=0.020275.

So 30,159.36 /0.020275≈ 1,487,550 Btu/hr.

But this is way higher than the options given. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is for heat transfer per unit length, so I should compute it per foot and then multiply by 12.

Wait, the formula is already for the entire length. So perhaps the mistake is in the units.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the radius in inches and converted k to per inch.

Let me try that.

r_i =2 inches, r_o=3 inches.

L=12 ft=144 inches.

k=0.05 Btu/hr-ft-°F =0.05 *12=0.6 Btu/hr-in-°F.

So the formula becomes:

Q/t = (2π *144 *400)/(ln(3/2) *0.6)

Compute numerator:2π≈6.2832. 6.2832*144=900.5376. 900.5376*400=360,215.04.

Denominator: ln(1.5)=0.4055 *0.6=0.2433.

So Q/t=360,215.04 /0.2433≈1,480,000 Btu/hr.

Again, same result. So that can't be right. I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the steel tube's inner surface is at 500°F, but the outer surface of the steel is at a different temperature. But the problem says the inner and outer of the insulation are at 500 and 100°F, so the steel's outer surface is at 500°F, and the insulation's inner surface is also at 500°F. So perhaps the steel's conductivity is not needed, as it's a solid conductor, and the heat is transferred through the insulation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should model the steel as a cylinder with thermal conductivity k_steel, but since it's not given, perhaps the problem only considers the insulation layer.

Wait, perhaps the formula is correct, but the answer options are wrong, or I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the entire length, but just the rate per unit length. Let me check the question again.

The question says: "determine the radial rate of heat loss over the total length of the rod." So it's the total heat loss over the entire length per hour.

But according to my calculations, it's around 1.48 million Btu/hr, but the options are way lower. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula or the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for a hollow cylinder, not a solid one. Wait, the formula I used is for a solid cylinder, but the hollow case is similar as long as the inner and outer radii are considered.

Wait, no, the formula is the same for a hollow cylinder when considering the insulation as the wall between r_i and r_o.

Wait, perhaps I should check the formula again.

The formula for heat transfer through a cylindrical wall is correct: Q/t = (2πL (T_i - T_o)) / (ln(r_o/r_i) *k).

So with that in mind, perhaps I made a mistake in the units.

Wait, perhaps the insulation is 1 inch thick, so the outer radius is 2 inches +1 inch=3 inches, but the inner radius is 2 inches. So that's correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the diameter instead of radius somewhere. Let me try that.

If I mistakenly used diameter instead of radius, then r_o would be 3 inches (diameter is 6 inches), but that's not the case. No, that wouldn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the natural log correctly. Let me check ln(3/2) again. Yes, it's approximately 0.4055.

Wait, perhaps I should try to compute it more accurately. Let me see:

ln(1.5) = 0.4054651081.

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should try to compute 30,159.36 divided by 0.020275 accurately.

Let me compute 0.020275 * x =30,159.36.

x=30,159.36 /0.020275.

Let me compute this using a different approach.

0.020275 = 20275e-6.

So x=30,159.36 / (20275e-6) =30,159.36 * (1e6/20275) ≈30,159.36 *49.323≈1,487,550.

Again, same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the formula gives the heat transfer rate in Btu per hour, but the options are in Btu per hour, so the numbers should match. But none of the options are near 1.48 million. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the problem statement again.

Problem says: 12 ft long, 4 in diameter steel tube. Insulated with 1 in thick layer. Insulation's thermal conductivity is 0.05 Btu/hr-ft-°F. Inner surface of insulation is 500°F, outer surface is 100°F.

Wait, perhaps the formula should use the outer diameter of the insulation, which is 4+2=6 inches, but that's the outer diameter. But I think I did that correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the surface area and then find the heat flux.

The surface area of the insulation is 2πrL, where r is the outer radius.

r=0.25 ft, L=12 ft.

So surface area A=2 * π *0.25 *12=6π≈18.8496 sq.ft.

The temperature difference ΔT=400°F.

The formula for heat transfer is Q/t = (ΔT / (ln(r_o/r_i)/k)) * (2πL).

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing formulas.

Alternatively, using the formula Q/t = (T_i - T_o) * (2πL) / (ln(r_o/r_i) *k).

Yes, that's the same formula as before.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it again.

But I'm stuck because my calculation gives a value way beyond the options provided.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the heat loss per foot, not the total. Let me check the question again.

Question says: "determine the radial rate of heat loss over the total length of the rod."

So it's the total heat loss over the entire 12 ft length.

Wait, perhaps the options are in Btu per hour per foot, but that would make more sense. Let me check.

If I compute per foot, then the formula becomes:

Q/t per foot = (2π (T_i - T_o)) / (ln(r_o/r_i) *k).

So:

2π *400 =800π≈2513.274.

Divide by (0.4055 *0.05)=0.020275.

So 2513.274 /0.020275≈123,968 Btu/(hr·ft).

Multiply by 12 ft:123,968 *12≈1,487,616 Btu/hr.

Again, same result. So perhaps the correct answer is approximately 1,487,550 Btu/hr, but none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the steel tube's inner surface is at 500°F, but the steel's outer surface is at a temperature higher than the insulation's inner surface, but that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps the steel's conductivity affects the heat transfer, but since it's not given, perhaps it's negligible.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the formula is correct. Another formula I recall is Q/t = (2πL (T_i - T_o))/(ln(r_o/r_i)*k).

Yes, that's correct for a cylindrical wall.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the steel tube's inner diameter is 4 inches, so the insulation's inner diameter is also 4 inches, and the insulation is 1 inch thick, making the outer diameter 6 inches.

Wait, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the area correctly. Wait, the area in the formula is accounted for by the 2πL term, so that's correct.

I'm stuck. My calculation leads to a value not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the formula is for a solid cylinder and not for a hollow one. Wait, no, the formula is applicable for both, as long as you're considering the correct radii.

Wait, perhaps the problem wants the heat loss per unit length, not total. Let me compute that.

Per foot:

(2π *1 *400)/(ln(3/2)*0.05) = (800π)/(0.4055 *0.05).

Compute denominator:0.4055 *0.05=0.020275.

800π≈2513.274.

2513.274 /0.020275≈123,968 Btu/(hr·ft).

But the options are in the thousands per hour, so this isn't matching either.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the heat flux at the surface and multiply by the area.

The heat flux q" = (k * ΔT) / (ln(r_o/r_i)).

So q" = (0.05 *400)/0.4055 ≈200 /0.4055≈493.04 Btu/(hr·ft²).

Then, the total heat loss Q/t = q" * surface area.

Surface area A=2πrL, where r is the outer radius (0.25 ft) and L=12 ft.

A=2π*0.25*12=6π≈18.8496 ft².

So Q/t=493.04 *18.8496≈493.04 *18.8496≈9,282 Btu/hr.

But that's still not matching the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the heat flux approach. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula for heat flux in cylindrical coordinates is q" = (k * (T_i - T_o)) / (ln(r_o/r_i)).

So q" = (0.05 *400)/0.4055 ≈493.04 Btu/(hr·ft²).

Then, the total heat loss is q" multiplied by the surface area. But wait, the surface area for heat transfer is the outer surface area of the insulation, which is 2πr_o L, where r_o is 0.25 ft.

So A=2π*0.25*12=6π≈18.8496 ft².

So Q/t=493.04 *18.8496≈9,282 Btu/hr.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using the inner surface area instead. The inner surface area is 2πr_i L=2π*0.1667*12≈12.566 ft².

Then Q/t=493.04 *12.566≈6,197 Btu/hr.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should use the average radius or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it differently.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it as:

Q/t = (π (T_i - T_o) L) / (ln(r_o/r_i) *k) ) * (r_o + r_i)/(r_o - r_i) )

Wait, no, that's for a different scenario.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to find an alternative approach.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the thermal resistance R = ln(r_o/r_i)/(2πkL).

Then, Q/t = (T_i - T_o)/R.

So R= ln(3/2)/(2π *0.05 *12).

Compute ln(1.5)=0.4055.

Denominator:2π*0.05*12=2*3.1416*0.05*12≈3.7699.

So R=0.4055 /3.7699≈0.1076 °F/(Btu/hr·ft²).

Then, Q/t=(500-100)/0.1076≈400/0.1076≈3,720 Btu/hr.

Ah! Now that's one of the options. Option J is 3720 Btu/hr.

So perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the setup. This approach gives 3720 Btu/hr, which is option J.

So where did I go wrong earlier? I think I might have confused the formula and setup. Using the thermal resistance approach gives a reasonable answer that matches one of the options.

So the correct answer should be J:3720 Btu/hr.
</think>

To determine the radial rate of heat loss over the total length of the insulated steel tube, we use the formula for steady-state heat conduction through a cylindrical wall:

\[
\frac{Q}{t} = \frac{2 \pi L (T_i - T_o)}{\ln\left(\frac{r_o}{r_i}\right) \cdot k}
\]

### Given Data:
- Length of the tube, \( L = 12 \, \text{ft} \)
- Inner diameter of the steel tube, \( d_i = 4 \, \text{in} \) → \( r_i = \frac{d_i}{2} = 2 \, \text{in} = \frac{2}{12} \, \text{ft} = 0.1667 \, \text{ft} \)
- Thickness of insulation, \( t = 1 \, \text{in} \) → \( r_o = r_i + t = 2 + 1 = 3 \, \text{in} = \frac{3}{12} \, \text{ft} = 0.25 \, \text{ft} \)
- Thermal conductivity of insulation, \( k = 0.05 \, \text{Btu/hr-ft-°F} \)
- Inner surface temperature, \( T_i = 500 \, \text{°F} \)
- Outer surface temperature, \( T_o = 100 \, \text{°F} \)

### Step 1: Calculate the temperature difference
\[
\Delta T = T_i - T_o = 500 - 100 = 400 \, \text{°F}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the natural logarithm term
\[
\ln\left(\frac{r_o}{r_i}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{0.25}{0.1667}\right) = \ln(1.5) \approx 0.4055
\]

### Step 3: Plug values into the formula
\[
\frac{Q}{t} = \frac{2 \pi L \Delta T}{\ln\left(\frac{r_o}{r_i}\right) \cdot k}
\]
\[
\frac{Q}{t} = \frac{2 \cdot 3.1416 \cdot 12 \cdot 400}{0.4055 \cdot 0.05}
\]

### Step 4: Compute the numerator
\[
2 \cdot 3.1416 \cdot 12 = 75.3984
\]
\[
75.3984 \cdot 400 = 30,159.36
\]

### Step 5: Compute the denominator
\[
0.4055 \cdot 0.05 = 0.020275
\]

### Step 6: Divide numerator by denominator
\[
\frac{Q}{t} = \frac{30,159.36}{0.020275} \approx 1,487,550 \, \text{Btu/hr}
\]

### Issue with the Result:
The calculated value of \( 1,487,550 \, \text{Btu/hr} \) is significantly higher than the provided answer options. This discrepancy suggests a mistake in the setup or interpretation of the problem.

### Alternative Approach:
Using the thermal resistance \( R \) method:
\[
R = \frac{\ln\left(\frac{r_o}{r_i}\right)}{2 \pi k L}
\]
\[
\frac{Q}{t} = \frac{\Delta T}{R}
\]

#### Step 1: Calculate \( R \)
\[
R = \frac{\ln(1.5)}{2 \pi \cdot 0.05 \cdot 12} = \frac{0.4055}{3.7699} \approx 0.1076 \, \text{°F/(Btu/hr-ft}^2\text{)}
\]

#### Step 2: Calculate \( \frac{Q}{t} \)
\[
\frac{Q}{t} = \frac{400}{0.1076} \approx 3,720 \, \text{Btu/hr}
\]

### Final Answer:
The radial rate of heat loss over the total length of the rod is approximately **3,720 Btu/hr**, which corresponds to **Option J**.

**Answer: J**
