Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about a shunt motor. Let's see what I remember from my studies. The question has two parts: finding the full-load armature current and calculating the torque of the machine. The options are given, so maybe I can work through each part step by step.

First, the motor is a shunt motor, which means the field winding is connected in parallel with the armature. The given data includes: power rating 15 hp, voltage 220V, speed 1800 rpm, efficiency 87%, and the field resistance is 440 ohms.

I think the first step is to find the armature current. I remember that the power input to the motor is P = V * I, where I is the armature current. But since the motor isn't 100% efficient, I need to account for that. The formula should be something like:

Power input (P_input) = (Power output (P_output)) / Efficiency.

So, the power output is 15 hp. I need to convert that to watts because the voltage is given in volts. I recall that 1 hp is approximately 746 watts. So, 15 hp would be 15 * 746 = 11,190 watts.

Now, the efficiency is 87%, which is 0.87 in decimal. So, P_input = 11,190 / 0.87. Let me calculate that: 11,190 divided by 0.87. Let me do that step by step. 11,190 ÷ 0.87... Hmm, 0.87 times 12,000 is 10,440, which is less than 11,190. Let me try 12,800: 0.87 * 12,800 = 11,136. Close. Let me calculate 11,190 ÷ 0.87 exactly. 11,190 ÷ 0.87 = 12,850.57 watts approximately.

So P_input is about 12,850.57 W. Now, P = V * I, so I = P / V. V is 220 volts. So I = 12,850.57 / 220. Let me compute that: 12,850.57 ÷ 220 ≈ 58.41 amperes. Hmm, looking at the options, the closest is option D: 58 amps. But wait, let me check if I did that correctly.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the calculation. 220 * 58 = 12,760. 220 * 58.41 ≈ 12,850. That's correct. So the armature current is approximately 58.41 A. Looking at the options, option D is 58 amps, which is very close. But wait, another thought: in shunt motors, the field current also draws from the same supply. So maybe I need to consider the field current as well. Oh, wait, no, because the armature current is the current through the armature, and the field is in parallel, so the total current is the sum of armature and field currents. But wait, the question is only asking for the armature current, so maybe I don't need to calculate the field current for part (a). Or do I?

Wait, no, the armature current is just I_a, and the field current is I_f. But since the motor is shunt, the armature current and field current are in parallel, so the total current from the supply is I_total = I_a + I_f. But for part (a), they just want I_a. So my initial calculation should be correct, giving I_a ≈58.4 A.

So part (a) is approximately 58.4 amps. Looking at the options, option D is 58 amps, which is very close. But wait, let me check if I made a mistake in the power calculation.

Wait, another approach: maybe the power input is P = (V * I_a) because the armature is where the current flows. But since the field is also connected in parallel, the field current is I_f = V / R_field. R_field is 440 ohms. So I_f = 220 / 440 = 0.5 A. So the total current from the supply is I_a + 0.5 A. But for part (a), the question is only about I_a, so I think my initial approach was correct. So I_a is around 58.4 A, which is approximately 58 amps.

Now, moving on to part (b): torque. I remember that torque (T) can be calculated using the formula T = (P_output) / (ω), where ω is the angular velocity in radians per second. Alternatively, since power can also be expressed as T * ω, I can use P = T * ω, so T = P / ω.

First, let's compute ω. The speed is 1800 rpm. To convert rpm to radians per second: ω = (1800 * 2π) / 60. Let me calculate that: 1800 /60 =30, so 30 * 2π =60π rad/s ≈ 188.5 rad/s.

The power output is 15 hp, which we converted to 11,190 W. So T = 11,190 / 188.5 ≈ let's compute that. 11,190 ÷ 188.5 ≈ 59.25 lb-ft. Wait, but that can't be right because the options don't have such a high torque. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the units again.

Wait, no, wait a second. The formula for torque in mechanical terms is T (in lb-ft) when power is in horsepower and speed is in rpm. There's another formula: T (lb-ft) = (5250 * hp) / speed (rpm). Let me recall that. Yes, because 5250 is the conversion factor from hp to torque in lb-ft when speed is in rpm.

So using that formula: T = (5250 * 15) / 1800. Let me compute that. 5250 *15 =78,750. Divided by 1800: 78,750 ÷ 1800 ≈ 43.75 lb-ft. Wait, that's about 43.75 lb-ft. So looking at the options, option F is 57.96 A and 43.77 lb-ft. But wait, I thought part (a) was 58.4 A, which is very close to option D's 58 A. But option F has a torque of 43.77 lb-ft, which is very close to what I just calculated. But wait, let me think again.

Wait, but when I used the P = T * ω method, I got around 59 lb-ft, which doesn't match. So which one is correct? Let me double-check the units.

Wait, the formula T = (5250 * hp) / rpm is correct because it's derived from the fact that 1 hp = 550 ft-lbf/s. So let's see: 1 hp = 550 ft-lbf per second. So power in hp multiplied by 550 gives the torque in lb-ft multiplied by the speed in rpm divided by 60 (to convert minutes to seconds). Wait, let me rederive it.

Power (hp) = (Torque (lb-ft) * speed (rpm)) / 550. So rearranged, Torque = (hp * 550) / speed (rpm). So 15 hp *550 = 8250, divided by 1800 rpm: 8250 / 1800 ≈4.5833 lb-ft. Wait, that can't be right because that's way too low. Hmm, I must have messed up the formula.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. The correct formula is T (lb-ft) = (5250 * hp) / rpm. Because 5250 comes from 550 * 60 / 2π. Wait, let me compute that: 550 ft-lbf/s is the power of 1 hp. Speed in rpm is revolutions per minute. To convert rpm to radians per second, multiply by 2π/60. So the torque in lb-ft would be Power (hp) * 550 / (2π * rpm /60) ) = (550 * 60 * hp) / (2π * rpm) ) = (550 * 30 * hp) / (π * rpm) ) ≈ (16,500 / π ) * hp / rpm ≈ 5250 * hp / rpm.

So yes, T = (5250 * hp) / rpm. So for 15 hp and 1800 rpm: T = (5250 *15)/1800 = (78,750)/1800 ≈43.75 lb-ft. So that's about 43.75 lb-ft, which matches option F's 43.77 lb-ft.

Alternatively, using the other method where I converted power to watts and then used T = P/(ω), let's see:

11,190 W is the power output. ω is 188.5 rad/s. So T = 11,190 / 188.5 ≈59.25 lb-ft. But that's conflicting with the other method. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the units. Because when using SI units, torque would be in Nm, not lb-ft. So perhaps I should convert everything to SI units.

Let me try that approach. 15 hp is 11,190 W. The speed is 1800 rpm, which is 1800 * 2π /60 = 188.5 rad/s.

Power P = T * ω → T = P / ω. So T = 11,190 / 188.5 ≈59.25 Nm. Now, to convert Nm to lb-ft: 1 Nm is approximately 0.7376 lb-ft. So 59.25 * 0.7376 ≈43.75 lb-ft. Ah, that matches the other method. So the torque is approximately 43.75 lb-ft.

So part (b) is approximately 43.75 lb-ft. Looking at the options, option F has 43.77 lb-ft, which is very close. So part (a) is approximately 58.4 A, and part (b) is approximately 43.75 lb-ft.

Looking at the options, option F is 57.96 amps and 43.77 lb-ft. Wait, but my calculation for part (a) was about 58.4 A, and option D is 58 A, but option F's current is 57.96 A, which is very close to 58. So perhaps the exact calculation would give 57.96 A, matching option F.

Wait, let me recalculate part (a) more accurately. The power input is P_input = 15 hp / 0.87. 15 hp is 11,190 W. So 11,190 / 0.87 = let's calculate that precisely.

11,190 ÷ 0.87:

0.87 * 12,800 = 11,136. 11,190 - 11,136 = 54. So 54 ÷ 0.87 ≈62.06897. So total is 12,800 + 62.06897 ≈12,862.06897 W.

Now, I = P_input / V → 12,862.06897 / 220 = let's compute that.

220 * 58 = 12,760. 12,862.07 -12,760 =102.07. 102.07 /220 ≈0.464. So total I ≈58.464 A, approximately 58.46 A. So that's about 58.46 A, which would round to 58.5 A. But option F is 57.96 A, which is slightly lower. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, another approach: maybe the power input is calculated correctly, but perhaps the armature current is I_a = (P_input - P_field) / V? No, that's not right. Because the field current is I_f = V / R_field, which is 220 /440 =0.5 A. So the power input to the field is I_f^2 * R_field = 0.5^2 *440 = 0.25 *440 =110 W. So the power input to the armature is P_input - P_field. Wait, no, because the total power input is P_input = V*(I_a + I_f) = V*I_a + V*I_f. So P_input = V*I_a + (V^2)/R_field.

So P_input = (V^2/R_field) + V*I_a.

We know P_input is 11,190 /0.87 ≈12,850.57 W.

So 12,850.57 = (220^2)/440 + 220 * I_a.

Calculate (220^2)/440: 220^2 is 48,400. 48,400 /440 =110. So 12,850.57 =110 + 220 I_a. Subtract 110: 12,850.57 -110 =12,740.57 =220 I_a. So I_a =12,740.57 /220 ≈57.9117 A. So approximately 57.91 A, which rounds to 57.91 A. Looking at the options, option F is 57.96 A, which is very close. So part (a) is approximately 57.91 A, and part (b) is approximately 43.75 lb-ft.

So the correct answer would be option F: 57.96 amps, 43.77 lb. ft.

Wait, but earlier I thought part (a) was 58.46 A when considering only the armature without subtracting the field power. That's where the confusion was. I forgot that the total input power includes both the armature and the field. So by correctly subtracting the field power, I get I_a ≈57.91 A, which aligns with option F.

So the correct answer is F.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the full-load armature current and then the torque of the shunt motor.

### Part (a): Full-Load Armature Current

1. **Convert Power Output to Watts**:  
   The motor's power output is 15 hp. Converting to watts:  
   \[
   15 \, \text{hp} \times 746 \, \text{W/hp} = 11,190 \, \text{W}.
   \]

2. **Calculate Power Input Using Efficiency**:  
   The motor's efficiency is 87%, so the power input is:  
   \[
   P_{\text{input}} = \frac{P_{\text{output}}}{\text{efficiency}} = \frac{11,190}{0.87} \approx 12,850.57 \, \text{W}.
   \]

3. **Calculate Total Current from Supply**:  
   The voltage is 220 V, so the total current is:  
   \[
   I_{\text{total}} = \frac{P_{\text{input}}}{V} = \frac{12,850.57}{220} \approx 58.41 \, \text{A}.
   \]

4. **Subtract Field Current to Find Armature Current**:  
   The field resistance is 440 Ω, so the field current is:  
   \[
   I_f = \frac{V}{R_{\text{field}}} = \frac{220}{440} = 0.5 \, \text{A}.
   \]  
   The armature current is:  
   \[
   I_a = I_{\text{total}} - I_f = 58.41 - 0.5 = 57.91 \, \text{A}.
   \]

### Part (b): Torque of the Machine

1. **Convert Speed to Angular Velocity**:  
   The speed is 1800 rpm, so angular velocity is:  
   \[
   \omega = \frac{1800 \times 2\pi}{60} \approx 188.5 \, \text{rad/s}.
   \]

2. **Calculate Torque Using Power**:  
   The torque is given by:  
   \[
   T = \frac{P_{\text{output}}}{\omega} = \frac{11,190}{188.5} \approx 59.25 \, \text{Nm}.
   \]  
   Converting to lb-ft:  
   \[
   1 \, \text{Nm} \approx 0.7376 \, \text{lb-ft}, \quad T \approx 59.25 \times 0.7376 \approx 43.75 \, \text{lb-ft}.
   \]

### Final Answer

The full-load armature current is approximately **57.91 A**, and the torque is approximately **43.75 lb-ft**. Comparing with the options, the closest match is:

**F: 57.96 amps, 43.77 lb. ft**

F
