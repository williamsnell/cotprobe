<think>
Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to break it down. 

The question says that in a certain community, 25% of all girls are blondes. So, if I consider the total number of girls, 25% are blondes, which means the probability of a girl being a blonde is 0.25. That's straightforward enough. 

Next, it says that 50% of all girls and 75% of all blondes have blue eyes. Wait, I need to parse that correctly. So, 50% of the entire girl population has blue eyes, regardless of being blonde or not. But then, among blondes, 75% have blue eyes. Hmm, that's interesting because it suggests that being a blonde increases the likelihood of having blue eyes. 

The main question is: If it is known that a girl has blue eyes, how much additional information is available if one is told that she is also a blonde? The options are given in bits, which I think relate to information theory, where the amount of information is measured in bits based on probabilities.

So, I think this is a problem about conditional probability and perhaps Bayes' theorem. Because we're given some information and we need to find how much more information knowing she's a blonde gives us, given that she has blue eyes.

First, let's define some variables to make this clearer. Let me denote:

- B: the event that a girl is a blonde.
- E: the event that a girl has blue eyes.

From the problem, we have:

- P(B) = 0.25 (probability of being a blonde)
- P(E) = 0.5 (probability of having blue eyes)
- P(E | B) = 0.75 (probability of having blue eyes given that she's a blonde)

Wait, but what about P(E | not B)? Because if 75% of blondes have blue eyes, and 50% of all girls have blue eyes, the non-blondes must have a lower rate. Let me calculate that.

The total probability of E is P(E) = P(E | B) * P(B) + P(E | not B) * P(not B). Plugging in the numbers:

0.5 = (0.75)(0.25) + P(E | not B)(0.75)

Calculating the first term: 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875

So, 0.5 = 0.1875 + P(E | not B)(0.75)

Subtracting 0.1875 from both sides: 0.5 - 0.1875 = 0.3125 = P(E | not B) * 0.75

So, P(E | not B) = 0.3125 / 0.75 ≈ 0.4167. So about 41.67% of non-blondes have blue eyes.

Now, the question is about the additional information when we know she's a blonde, given that she has blue eyes. So, I think this relates to the conditional probability of being a blonde given that she has blue eyes, and how much information that gives us beyond just knowing she has blue eyes.

Wait, but the question is phrased in terms of information, so maybe it's about the change in entropy or the information gained. Alternatively, perhaps it's the difference in the bits of information before and after knowing she's a blonde.

In information theory, the information content is often calculated using the logarithm of probabilities. The formula for information I is I = log2(1/P), where P is the probability of the event.

But I'm not entirely sure how this applies here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the conditional entropy. When we have some information, like knowing she has blue eyes, how much more information do we get by knowing she is a blonde.

Wait, maybe the question is about the expected value of the information gained. So, if we know that a girl has blue eyes, the probability she is a blonde is higher than the general population. The additional information is the increase in our certainty about her being a blonde when we know she has blue eyes.

So, perhaps we can calculate the conditional probability P(B | E), and then find the information content before and after. But I'm not 100% sure.

Let me try to compute P(B | E) using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(B | E) = [P(E | B) * P(B)] / P(E)

We have all these values:

P(E | B) = 0.75, P(B) = 0.25, P(E) = 0.5

Plugging in:

P(B | E) = (0.75 * 0.25) / 0.5 = (0.1875) / 0.5 = 0.375

So, if a girl has blue eyes, the probability she's a blonde is 0.375 or 37.5%.

Wait, that seems lower than I expected. Because among all blondes, 75% have blue eyes, but the overall rate is 50%, so the conditional probability is 37.5%. Hmm, makes sense because there are more non-blondes in the population, and their blue eye rate is lower.

Now, the question is about the additional information. So, perhaps the initial information when we know she has blue eyes is that she's in the 50% group. Then, knowing she's a blonde gives us more information, so we can update our probability from 25% to 37.5%? Wait, no, because P(B | E) is 37.5%, which is higher than the prior of 25%. So, knowing she has blue eyes increases the probability that she's a blonde.

Wait, but the question is how much additional information is available if we know she's a blonde, given that she has blue eyes. So, perhaps we're looking at the change in the probability of being a blonde when we condition on both E and B.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the information gained by knowing that she's a blonde, given that she has blue eyes. So, perhaps we need to calculate the information content of P(B | E) compared to P(B) or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the difference in information between the prior probability of being a blonde and the posterior probability after knowing she has blue eyes.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the mutual information between the events B and E, but given that E has occurred. Alternatively, maybe it's about the change in bits when we condition on B given E.

Wait, let me think differently. The question is about how much additional information is provided by knowing she's a blonde, given that she has blue eyes. So, perhaps it's the difference in the information content between the prior and the posterior.

In other words, the information content before knowing she's a blonde is the probability of being a blonde given E, which is 37.5%. The information content after knowing she's a blonde is 100% (since she's a blonde). So the additional information is the difference in bits between these two.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the conditional entropy.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the entropy before and after knowing she's a blonde, given that she has blue eyes. The additional information would be the difference in entropy.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the log odds or the change in log probability.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as follows: The information available is about the probability of being a blonde given blue eyes. When we are told she's a blonde, it changes this probability from 37.5% to 100%. So, the information gained is the difference between the entropy before and after.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the amount of information in bits that is gained by knowing she's a blonde, given that she has blue eyes.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to model this mathematically.

The initial information when we know she has blue eyes is that her probability of being a blonde is 37.5%. The additional information comes when we are told she's a blonde, which changes the probability to 100%. So, the information gained is the difference in the bits between these two probabilities.

Wait, but how is information calculated here? The information content of an event is usually given by I = log2(1/p), where p is the probability of the event. So, the information gained by knowing she's a blonde, given that she has blue eyes, would be the change in the information content.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

Additional Information = log2(P(B | E)) - log2(P(B))

But wait, that would be the change in the information content. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the conditional information.

Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of the conditional probability. The prior probability of being a blonde is 0.25, and the posterior probability given E is 0.375. So, the information is the difference between the bits of these two probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the likelihood ratio. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me try to compute the bits of information. The information content is the amount of surprise, so lower probability events give more information.

If I know that a girl has blue eyes, the probability she's a blonde is 0.375. The information content of that is log2(1/0.375) ≈ 1.415 bits. Wait, but that's more than 1 bit. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, the formula is I = log2(1/p), so for p=0.375, I = log2(1/0.375) = log2(2.666...) ≈ 1.415 bits.

But wait, without any information, the prior probability of being a blonde is 0.25, which would be log2(4) = 2 bits. So, knowing that she has blue eyes changes the information from 2 bits to 1.415 bits, which actually reduces the information. That doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I got it backwards. Maybe the information is about the event given the condition. So, when we know she has blue eyes, the information about her being a blonde is 1.415 bits. When we also know she's a blonde, the information becomes 0 bits, because it's certain. So the additional information is the difference between 1.415 bits and 0, which is 1.415 bits. But that doesn't seem to fit the options correctly.

Wait, the options include I: 1.415 bits, but that seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the difference in the bits of information between the case where we only know she has blue eyes and the case where we know she has blue eyes and is a blonde.

Wait, but if we know she has blue eyes and is a blonde, that's more specific, so perhaps the information is higher. Hmm.

Wait, maybe another approach. The question is about how much additional information is available if we are told she's a blonde, given that she has blue eyes. So, in other words, how much more certain are we about her being a blonde when we already know she has blue eyes.

The initial uncertainty without any information is log2(1/0.25) = 2 bits. But when we know she has blue eyes, the probability becomes 0.375, so the information is log2(1/0.375) ≈ 1.415 bits. Then, when we are told she's a blonde, the probability becomes 1, so the information is log2(1/1) = 0 bits. So the additional information is the difference between the two, which is 1.415 - 0 = 1.415 bits. But that's option I. However, I'm not sure if this is the correct approach.

Wait, perhaps I should instead compute the change in information when we condition on being a blonde. So, the information before knowing she's a blonde is P(B|E) = 0.375, which is 1.415 bits. After knowing she's a blonde, the information is 0 bits, so the additional information is 1.415 bits. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if this is the right way to model it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the mutual information between B and E. Mutual information is a measure of how much knowing one variable reduces uncertainty about the other. So, perhaps the mutual information I(B;E) is the expected value of the information gained about B by observing E, or vice versa.

But the question is specifically about the additional information when told she's a blonde, given that she has blue eyes. So, perhaps it's about the change in the probability of B given E when we condition further on B.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler. It's asking how much additional information is provided by knowing she's a blonde, given that she has blue eyes. So, perhaps it's the difference in the bits of information between the prior and the posterior.

Wait, the prior probability of being a blonde is 0.25 (2 bits). The posterior probability given E is 0.375 (1.415 bits). So, the information has decreased, which would mean that knowing she has blue eyes reduces the uncertainty about being a blonde. But the question is about the additional information when we tell her she's a blonde, given that she has blue eyes.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think in terms of the problem again.

We have a girl with blue eyes. Without any other info, the chance she's a blonde is 37.5%. If we then tell her she's a blonde, that gives us more information. So, the question is, how much more information does that give us?

In terms of bits, the information is the reduction in uncertainty. The initial uncertainty is log2(1/0.375) ≈ 1.415 bits. After knowing she's a blonde, the uncertainty is 0. So, the additional information is 1.415 bits. But that's option I, which is 1.415 bits. However, I'm not sure if this is correct because the options include other values, like 0.75 bits, which might be the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I should model it differently. The question is about the additional information when we know she's a blonde, given that she has blue eyes. So, perhaps it's the conditional probability of being a blonde given blue eyes, and then the change when we know she's a blonde.

Wait, another approach: The problem is about Bayesian updating. When we know E, the probability of B is 37.5%. If we then condition on B, the probability becomes 1, so the information gained is the difference in bits between these two.

But perhaps the correct way is to compute the bits of information in the conditional probability. So, the information when we know E is log2(1/0.375) ≈ 1.415 bits. The information when we know both E and B is log2(1/1) = 0 bits. So, the additional information is 1.415 - 0 = 1.415 bits. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation.

Alternatively, perhaps the additional information is the difference between the prior and the posterior. The prior was 25%, posterior is 37.5%, so the information gained is log2(1/0.375) - log2(1/0.25) = 1.415 - 2 = -0.585 bits, which doesn't make sense because information can't be negative.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Maybe I should calculate the mutual information between B and E, which is I(B;E) = H(B) - H(B|E), where H is entropy.

H(B) is the entropy of B, which is -0.25 log2(0.25) - 0.75 log2(0.75) ≈ 0.25 * 2 + 0.75 * 0.415 ≈ 0.5 + 0.311 = 0.811 bits.

H(B|E) is the entropy of B given E. Since P(B|E)=0.375 and P(not B|E)=0.625, H(B|E) = -0.375 log2(0.375) - 0.625 log2(0.625) ≈ 0.375 * 1.415 + 0.625 * 0.678 ≈ 0.5306 + 0.42375 ≈ 0.954 bits.

So, mutual information I(B;E) = 0.811 - 0.954 ≈ -0.143 bits. That can't be right because mutual information can't be negative. I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute H(B) correctly. H(B) = -P(B) log P(B) - P(not B) log P(not B).

So, P(B)=0.25, P(not B)=0.75.

H(B) = -(0.25 * log2(0.25)) - (0.75 * log2(0.75)) = -(0.25 * (-2)) - (0.75 * (-0.415)) = 0.5 + 0.311 ≈ 0.811 bits.

H(B|E) is the entropy of B given E. Since P(B|E)=0.375, P(not B|E)=0.625.

H(B|E) = -(0.375 log2(0.375) + 0.625 log2(0.625)).

Calculating each term:

0.375 log2(0.375) ≈ 0.375 * (-1.415) ≈ -0.5306

0.625 log2(0.625) ≈ 0.625 * (-0.678) ≈ -0.42375

So, H(B|E) ≈ 0.5306 + 0.42375 ≈ 0.954 bits.

So, mutual information I(B;E) = H(B) - H(B|E) = 0.811 - 0.954 ≈ -0.143 bits. That's impossible because mutual information can't be negative. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate I(B;E) = H(E) - H(E|B). Hmm, let me try that.

H(E) is the entropy of E. P(E)=0.5, P(not E)=0.5.

H(E) = -0.5 log2(0.5) -0.5 log2(0.5) = 0.5 +0.5 =1 bit.

H(E|B) is the entropy of E given B. Since P(E|B)=0.75, P(not E|B)=0.25.

H(E|B) = -0.75 log2(0.75) -0.25 log2(0.25) ≈ 0.75*0.415 + 0.25*2 ≈ 0.311 +0.5=0.811 bits.

So, mutual information I(B;E) = H(E) - H(E|B) =1 -0.811=0.189 bits. That makes sense.

But the question is about additional information when told she's a blonde, given that she has blue eyes. So, perhaps the mutual information is 0.189 bits, but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, maybe I'm not on the right track.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the change in the bits when we know she's a blonde. So, the initial information when we know she has blue eyes is that she's in the group of blue-eyed girls, which has a certain probability of being blonde. When we condition on her being a blonde, it gives us more information.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the change in the odds of being a blonde when we know she has blue eyes. So, the odds ratio is P(B|E)/P(not B|E) = 0.375 / 0.625 = 0.6. The log odds would be log2(0.6) ≈ -0.737 bits. But that's negative, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler. It's asking for the amount of information in bits that is gained by knowing she's a blonde, given that she has blue eyes. So, perhaps it's the difference between the posterior odds and the prior odds, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the odds ratio before and after. The prior odds of being a blonde are P(B)/P(not B) = 0.25/0.75 = 1/3. The posterior odds, given E, are P(B|E)/P(not B|E) = 0.375 / 0.625 = 0.6. The odds ratio is 0.6 / (1/3) = 1.8. The log2 of 1.8 is about 0.847 bits. But that's not one of the options either.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. The problem is asking how much additional information is provided by knowing she's a blonde, given that she has blue eyes.

In other words, knowing that she's a blonde gives us more information about her having blue eyes, but the question is phrased the other way around. Wait, no, the question is phrased as: given that she has blue eyes, how much more information do we get by knowing she's a blonde.

So, perhaps it's the change in the probability of being a blonde from the prior (0.25) to the posterior (0.375). The information gained is the difference in bits between these two probabilities.

The prior information content is log2(1/0.25) = 2 bits.

The posterior information content is log2(1/0.375) ≈ 1.415 bits.

So, the additional information is 2 - 1.415 = 0.585 bits. Hmm, that's approximately 0.585 bits, which is close to option F: 0.75 bits or option G: 0.25 bits. But 0.585 is closer to 0.58, which isn't one of the options exactly. Alternatively, perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps instead of using the prior and posterior, I should calculate the change in information when we condition on B given E. The initial state is knowing E, which gives a certain probability for B. Knowing B given E makes it certain.

So, the initial uncertainty is the entropy H(B|E) which we calculated as approximately 0.954 bits. After knowing B, the entropy is 0. So, the additional information is 0.954 bits. But that's not one of the options either.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the mutual information between B and E, which we found to be approximately 0.189 bits. But that's not one of the options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the difference in the bits between the probability of being a blonde given blue eyes and the prior probability. So, the change in bits is from 0.25 (2 bits) to 0.375 (1.415 bits), which is a decrease of 0.585 bits. But the question is about additional information, so perhaps it's the amount of information that knowing she's a blonde provides, given E.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the likelihood ratio. The likelihood ratio is P(E|B)/P(E|not B) = 0.75 / 0.4167 ≈ 1.8. The log2 of that is about 0.847 bits, which is approximately 0.85 bits, which is option A.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F: 0.75 bits, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, let me try to think about the problem again. The question is about the additional information when told she's a blonde, given that she has blue eyes. So, perhaps it's the amount of information in the fact that she's a blonde, knowing that she has blue eyes.

The initial information is that she has blue eyes. The probability she's a blonde is 37.5%. The additional information comes from knowing she's a blonde, which changes the probability from 37.5% to 100%. So, the information gained is the difference in bits between these two probabilities.

The information content of 37.5% is log2(1/0.375) ≈ 1.415 bits.

The information content of 100% is 0 bits.

So, the additional information is 1.415 bits. But that's option I, which is 1.415 bits. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the change in the bits of information when we condition on B given E. So, the initial uncertainty is 1.415 bits, and after knowing she's a blonde, it's 0, so the information gained is 1.415 bits. But again, that's option I.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the conditional entropy H(B | E). We have P(B|E)=0.375, P(not B|E)=0.625.

H(B | E) = -0.375 log2(0.375) - 0.625 log2(0.625) ≈ 0.5306 + 0.42375 ≈ 0.954 bits.

If we know she's a blonde, then the entropy H(B | E, B) = 0, since it's certain.

So, the reduction in entropy is 0.954 bits. Therefore, the additional information is 0.954 bits. But that's not one of the options exactly, though option H is 1.75 bits, which is higher. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the bits differently. Let me recalculate H(B|E):

H(B|E) = 0.375 * log2(1/0.375) + 0.625 * log2(1/0.625)

Which is 0.375 * 1.415 ≈ 0.5306 and 0.625 * 0.678 ≈ 0.42375. Total ≈ 0.954 bits.

So, if we know she's a blonde, the entropy becomes 0. So, the additional information is 0.954 bits. But that's not an option. The closest is option H: 1.75 bits, which is higher. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler. The question is about the additional information, which is the difference in probabilities, but perhaps it's just the difference in the bits between the posterior and prior.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the change in the bits of information when we condition on B given E. So, the prior is P(B)=0.25 (2 bits), and the posterior is P(B|E)=0.375 (1.415 bits). The change is 1.415 - 2 = -0.585 bits, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F: 0.75 bits. Because the probability increases from 25% to 37.5%, which is an increase of 12.5 percentage points, but that doesn't directly translate to bits.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the likelihood ratio. The likelihood ratio is the ratio of the probabilities of E given B and E given not B. So, LR = P(E|B)/P(E|not B) = 0.75 / 0.4167 ≈ 1.8. The log2 of that is approximately 0.847 bits, which is about 0.85 bits, option A.

But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the amount of information in knowing B given E, which is the mutual information. We calculated that as approximately 0.189 bits, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the change in the odds. The prior odds of being a blonde are 1/3 (since 25% / 75%). The posterior odds are 0.375 / 0.625 = 0.6, which is 3/5. The odds ratio is (3/5)/(1/3) = 9/5 = 1.8. The log2 of 1.8 is approximately 0.847 bits, which is close to option A: 0.85 bits.

So, perhaps the answer is A: 0.85 bits.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is F: 0.75 bits, as that's the difference in probabilities (0.375 - 0.25 = 0.125, but that doesn't directly translate to bits).

Wait, another approach: The amount of information is the change in the bits when we condition on B given E. So, the initial information is the entropy H(B|E) ≈ 0.954 bits. After knowing she's a blonde, the entropy is 0. So, the additional information is 0.954 bits. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the expected value of the information content. So, when we know she has blue eyes, the probability she's a blonde is 37.5%, so the information content is 1.415 bits. When we are told she's a blonde, the information content becomes 0. So, the additional information is 1.415 bits. That's option I.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F: 0.75 bits, as that's the difference in probabilities in some way.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the bits gained by knowing B given E. So, the probability of B given E is 37.5%, which is 3/8. The bits are log2(8/3) ≈ 1.415 bits. If we are told she's a blonde, the probability becomes 1, which is 0 bits. So, the additional information is 1.415 bits. That's option I.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is F: 0.75 bits, as that's the difference between 0.75 and 0.5, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the information gain, which is the difference between the entropy before and after. The entropy before knowing B is H(B|E) ≈ 0.954 bits. After knowing B, it's 0. So, the information gain is 0.954 bits, which is not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is G: 0.25 bits, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler than I'm making it. The question is, given that a girl has blue eyes, how much additional information is there if we know she's a blonde. So, perhaps it's the difference in the bits between the probability of being a blonde given blue eyes and the prior probability.

The prior is 0.25 (2 bits). The posterior is 0.375 (1.415 bits). The difference is 0.585 bits, which is approximately 0.585, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the change in the odds, which we calculated as about 0.85 bits.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F: 0.75 bits, because 0.75 is the probability of E given B, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I've spent too much time on this and need to make a decision. Based on the calculations, the mutual information is about 0.189 bits, which isn't an option. The change in the odds is about 0.85 bits, which is option A. Alternatively, the information gain is the difference in entropy, which is around 0.954 bits, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option F: 0.75 bits, as that's the probability of E given B minus the overall E probability, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the answer is F: 0.75 bits, because when we know she's a blonde, the probability of E is 0.75, and without knowing, it's 0.5, so the difference is 0.25, which in bits is log2(4)=2, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option F: 0.75 bits, but I'm not entirely confident.

The problem involves calculating the additional information provided by knowing a girl is a blonde, given that she has blue eyes. Using conditional probabilities and information theory concepts, the key steps are:

1. **Define Variables**:  
   - \( B \): Girl is a blonde (\( P(B) = 0.25 \)).  
   - \( E \): Girl has blue eyes (\( P(E) = 0.5 \)).  
   - \( P(E|B) = 0.75 \), \( P(E|\neg B) \approx 0.4167 \).  

2. **Calculate \( P(B|E) \)** using Bayes' theorem:  
   \[
   P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B)P(B)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.75 \times 0.25}{0.5} = 0.375
   \]

3. **Information Content**:  
   - Prior information (\( P(B) = 0.25 \)): \( \log_2(1/0.25) = 2 \) bits.  
   - Posterior information (\( P(B|E) = 0.375 \)): \( \log_2(1/0.375) \approx 1.415 \) bits.  
   - Additional information = Prior - Posterior = \( 2 - 1.415 = 0.585 \) bits.  

4. **Interpretation**:  
   The additional information gained by knowing she is a blonde, given blue eyes, is approximately **0.585 bits**, which aligns closely with **0.75 bits** as the closest option.

**Answer: F**
