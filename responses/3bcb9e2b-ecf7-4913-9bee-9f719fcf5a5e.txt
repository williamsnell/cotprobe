Question:

Optometrists use a linear scale of lens power, measured in diopters, to prescribe corrective lenses. Sufferers of myopia, or nearsightedness, have difficulty resolving distant objects because the lenses in their eyes are too strong. If a myopic person has a prescription of -5 diopters, what image do her corrective lenses create for distant objects?

Options:

A: An upright, real image about 20 cm behind her eyes
B: An upright, virtual image about 5 cm behind her eyes
C: An inverted, virtual image about 20 cm in front of her eyes
D: An inverted, real image about 20 cm behind her eyes
E: An inverted, real image about 20 cm in front of her eyes
F: An inverted, virtual image 5 cm behind her eyes
G: An upright, real image about 5 cm in front of her eyes
H: An upright, virtual image about 20 cm in front of her eyes
I: An upright, real image about 20 cm in front of her eyes
J: An inverted, real image about 5 cm in front of her eyes

Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I have this question about optometry and corrective lenses for someone who's myopic, which is nearsightedness. The question is asking about the image created by the corrective lenses for distant objects when the prescription is -5 diopters. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

First, I remember that diopters are the unit used to measure lens power. The higher the diopter, the stronger the lens. But wait, in prescriptions, a minus sign indicates that the person is nearsighted. So a -5 diopter prescription means the lens is diverging, right? Because converging lenses have positive diopters for farsightedness (hyperopia).

Now, the problem is about what image the corrective lenses create for distant objects. Distant objects are at infinity, but since lenses can't handle infinity directly, I think we use the thin lens formula, which is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di. Here, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.

Wait, for an object at infinity, the object distance do approaches infinity. So when do is very large, 1/do approaches zero. That makes the equation 1/f = 0 + 1/di, so di would be approximately equal to f. So the image is formed at the focal length of the lens.

But wait, the lens here is a diverging lens because the prescription is negative. Diverging lenses have virtual focal points on the same side as the object. So the focal length f would be negative. Let me think: the prescription is -5 diopters, which means the lens power P is -5 D. Since P = 1/f, f = 1/P. So f = 1/(-5) meters, which is -0.2 meters, or -20 cm. So the focal length is -20 cm.

Wait, but for a diverging lens, the focal length is negative, meaning it's on the same side as the incoming light. So when an object is at infinity, the image formed by a diverging lens is virtual, upright, and located at the focal point. So the image is 20 cm behind the lens, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify.

In the case of a diverging lens (negative diopter), when the object is at infinity, the image is formed at the focal point. Since the lens is diverging, the focal point is virtual and on the same side as the object. So the image distance di would be equal to the focal length, which is negative because it's a virtual image.

Wait, but in the options, the image is described as being behind or in front of the eyes. So if the lens is in front of the eye, the image is formed behind the lens. So for a diverging lens, the image is virtual and located 20 cm behind the lens. But since the corrective lens is worn in front of the eye, the image is 20 cm behind the corrective lens, which would be behind the person's eyes.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The corrective lenses are used to correct myopia, so they're diverging lenses. The purpose is to reduce the converging power of the eye's lens so that the light is spread out more, allowing the retina to focus it correctly.

When the object is at infinity, the diverging lens will form a virtual image at its focal point. So for a -5 diopter lens, the focal length is -20 cm. The image is virtual, upright, and located 20 cm in front of the lens but on the same side as the object. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should draw a diagram.

Wait, no. For a diverging lens, the focal point is on the same side as the incoming light. So if the object is at infinity, the image is formed at the focal point, which is 20 cm behind the lens. But since the lens is part of the eye's system, the image is formed behind the lens, which would be behind the eye.

Wait, but in the options, the image is described as being behind or in front of her eyes. So if the corrective lens is in front of the eye, the image is formed behind the lens, which is about 20 cm behind her eyes. The image is virtual because it's on the same side as the object. So the image is upright and virtual, located 20 cm behind her eyes.

Looking at the options, option A says an upright, real image about 20 cm behind her eyes. But wait, no, because a diverging lens creates a virtual image, not real. So option A is real, which can't be right because diverging lenses can't form real images for objects at infinity. So A is out.

Option B: upright, virtual, about 5 cm behind. Hmm, but we calculated 20 cm. So B is 5 cm, which doesn't match. So B is not right.

Option C: inverted, virtual, 20 cm in front. No, because it's diverging, the image is virtual and behind. So C is out.

Option D: inverted, real, 20 cm behind. No, because real images would require a converging lens, and the image would be inverted. But in this case, the image is virtual and upright. So D is wrong.

Option E: inverted, real, 20 cm in front. No, same issue with real and inverted.

Option F: inverted, virtual, 5 cm behind. Again, inverted doesn't make sense because diverging lenses make upright images when the object is at infinity. So F is wrong.

Option G: upright, real, 5 cm in front. No, because it's real and in front, which doesn't fit.

Option H: upright, virtual, 20 cm in front. Wait, 20 cm in front of her eyes. But we calculated 20 cm behind the lens, which is behind her eyes. So H says 20 cm in front, which is opposite. So H is incorrect.

Option I: upright, real, 20 cm in front. No, because real images aren't formed by diverging lenses for objects at infinity.

Option J: inverted, real, 5 cm in front. No, same issues.

Wait, so the correct image should be upright, virtual, 20 cm behind her eyes. But looking at the options, option A is upright, real, which is wrong. Option B is 5 cm, no. So none of the options seem to match? Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. The lens prescription is -5 diopters. So the power P is -5 D. The focal length f is 1/P, so f = -1/5 = -0.2 m = -20 cm. So the focal point is 20 cm in front of the lens on the same side as the object (since it's diverging). Wait, no. Wait, the sign conventions can be tricky.

In optics, the sign of the focal length depends on the type of lens. For diverging lenses (concave), the focal length is negative, and the focal point is on the same side as the incoming light. So when the object is at infinity, the image is formed at the focal point, which is 20 cm behind the lens, because the lens is diverging, causing the light to appear to come from that point behind.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused again. Let me think in terms of the image distance. For a diverging lens, when the object is at infinity, the image is formed at the focal point, which is a virtual image located at f on the same side as the object. So for a -5 diopter lens, f is -20 cm. So the image is 20 cm behind the lens. But the lens is worn in front of the eye, so the image is 20 cm behind the lens, which is behind the eye.

So the image is virtual, upright, and located 20 cm behind the lens (i.e., behind the eyes). Looking at the options, option A says "An upright, real image about 20 cm behind her eyes." But wait, the image is virtual, not real. So option A is incorrect because it's real.

Wait, so none of the options seem to fit. Did I make a mistake? Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: upright, real, 20 cm behind → incorrect because it's real.

B: upright, virtual, 5 cm → wrong distance.

H: upright, virtual, 20 cm in front → the image is behind, so H is wrong.

Wait, wait. Maybe I mixed up the directions. The image is formed behind the lens, which is in front of the eye. So the image is behind the lens, which is in front of the eye, so the image is behind the eye. So the distance is about 20 cm behind the eyes.

But looking at the options, option A says 20 cm behind, but it's a real image. Option B is 5 cm. So perhaps I was wrong about the focal length. Wait, did I calculate the focal length correctly?

Wait, diopters are in meters. So -5 diopters is -5 m⁻¹. So f = 1/(-5) = -0.2 m = -20 cm. So the image is at -20 cm, meaning 20 cm behind the lens.

So the image is virtual, upright, and 20 cm behind the lens, which is behind the eyes.

Looking at the options again:

A: upright, real, 20 cm behind → no, it's virtual.

B: upright, virtual, 5 cm → no.

Wait, none of the options say upright, virtual, 20 cm behind. Hmm. Did I miss something?

Wait, maybe the question is about the eye's own lens, not the corrective lens. Wait no, the question is about the corrective lenses creating the image.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the eye's lens and the corrective lens. The corrective lens is used to adjust the incoming light so that the eye's own lens can focus it properly.

Wait, for a myopic person, their eye's lens is too strong, so the corrective lens is a diverging lens to reduce the total converging power. So when they look at a distant object (infinity), the corrective lens forms an image at its focal point, which is virtual, upright, and 20 cm behind the corrective lens. Since the corrective lens is in front of the eye, the image is 20 cm behind the eyes.

So the image is virtual, upright, and 20 cm behind her eyes. But looking at the options, none of them match that except perhaps option A, but A says real, which is wrong.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the sign. Let me think about the image distance. The lens formula gives 1/f = 1/do + 1/di. For do = infinity, 1/do =0, so 1/di = 1/f. So di = f. Since f is -20 cm, di is -20 cm, which means the image is 20 cm on the same side as the object (virtual), behind the lens.

So the image is virtual, upright, and 20 cm behind the lens, which is behind the eyes. So the correct option should be: upright, virtual, 20 cm behind the eyes. But looking at the options, that's not present.

Wait, let's look again. Option A is upright, real, 20 cm behind. No. Option B: upright, virtual, 5 cm → no. Option H: upright, virtual, 20 cm in front → no, it's behind.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake. Let me think about the direction again. The image is formed at the focal point of the corrective lens, which is 20 cm behind the lens because it's a diverging lens. So behind the lens, which is in front of the eye. So the image is 20 cm behind the lens, which is in front of the eye. So the image is 20 cm behind the eyes.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Did I misread the options? Let me check again.

Options:

A: An upright, real image about 20 cm behind her eyes.

B: An upright, virtual image about 5 cm behind her eyes.

C: An inverted, virtual image about 20 cm in front of her eyes.

D: An inverted, real image about 20 cm behind her eyes.

E: An inverted, real image about 20 cm in front of her eyes.

F: An inverted, virtual image 5 cm behind her eyes.

G: An upright, real image about 5 cm in front of her eyes.

H: An upright, virtual image about 20 cm in front of her eyes.

I: An upright, real image about 20 cm in front of her eyes.

J: An inverted, real image about 5 cm in front of her eyes.

Hmm, none of the options correctly state upright, virtual, 20 cm behind. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, maybe the image is formed in front of the lens, but that doesn't make sense with a diverging lens.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the eye's accommodation. For a myopic person, their eye's lens is too strong, so the corrective lens provides a diverging effect. When looking at a distant object, the light is spread out, causing the eye's lens to focus the image correctly on the retina. The corrective lens doesn't form an image itself but adjusts the entering light. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. The corrective lens does form an image, but for a myopic person, the image formed by the corrective lens is at a certain point so that the eye can focus it correctly. Wait, perhaps the image is formed at the near point, which is about 20 cm in front of the eye. But for a myopic person, the near point is at infinity, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try another approach. For a myopic person, the corrective lens is a diverging lens. The purpose is to reduce the convergence of light entering the eye. When the person looks at a distant object, the corrective lens causes the light to diverge, so the eye's lens doesn't have to converge as much. The diverging lens's focal point is where the image is formed. So the image is at the focal point of the corrective lens, which is 20 cm behind the lens. Since the lens is in front of the eye, the image is 20 cm behind the eyes.

So the image is virtual, upright, and 20 cm behind the eyes. But the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the image being behind. Because when the light is diverging, the eye's lens can focus it properly, so maybe the image is formed in front of the eye.

Wait, no. The image formed by the diverging lens is a virtual image located at its focal point, which is behind the lens. So the image is behind the eyes. So again, looking at the options, the only one that mentions 20 cm behind is option A, but it's real. So perhaps none of the options are correct, but that's unlikely.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate the focal length. The prescription is -5 diopters, which is -5 m⁻¹. So f = 1 / (-5) = -0.2 m = -20 cm. So the image is at -20 cm, which is 20 cm behind the lens, which is behind the eyes.

So the image is virtual, upright, and 20 cm behind the eyes. But none of the options match this exactly. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the question is asking about the image formed by the eye's lens, not the corrective lens. But no, the question says the corrective lenses create the image.

Wait, perhaps the image is formed at the near point of the eye, which is about 25 cm in front. But that's for close objects, not distant ones. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the image is formed at the far point, which for a myopic person is beyond infinity, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up real and virtual images. Let me think: for a diverging lens, an object at infinity forms a virtual, upright image at the focal point, which is on the same side as the object. So the image is behind the lens, which is in front of the eye, so it's behind the eye.

So the image is virtual, upright, and 20 cm behind the eyes. But again, the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct option is A, but it's real, which contradicts what I know.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the image being virtual. Let me think again. When an object is at infinity, a converging lens forms a real image at f. A diverging lens can't form a real image; it forms a virtual image at f, but on the same side as the object. So the image is virtual, upright, and located at 20 cm behind the lens.

So the only option that matches is... none of them. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me look at the options again.

Wait, option B is 5 cm behind. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Wait, 5 diopters would give a focal length of 20 cm, but the prescription is -5 diopters, so the focal length is 20 cm. Wait, but 5 diopters would be 20 cm focal length. But the prescription is -5, so f is -20 cm.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the image distance being 5 cm. Wait, no, because for an object at infinity, the image distance equals the focal length. So it's 20 cm, not 5 cm.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up meters and centimeters. No, the calculation is correct: -5 diopters is -5 m⁻¹, so f is -0.2 m or -20 cm.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but that's 5 cm, which doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the eye's lens, not the corrective lens. No, the question says the corrective lenses create the image.

Alternatively, maybe the image is formed at the retina, which is about 2 cm behind the eye. But that's for the eye's own focusing, not the corrective lens.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The corrective lens is a diverging lens with P = -5 D, so f = -20 cm. The image formed by the lens is at f, which is 20 cm behind the lens. The image is virtual, upright, and located 20 cm behind the lens, which is behind the eyes. So the image is 20 cm behind her eyes, upright, and virtual.

Looking at the options again, the only option that mentions 20 cm behind is option A, but it says real. The other option is B with 5 cm, which is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option B, but that's 5 cm. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is none of the above, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the image being behind. Maybe the image is in front of the lens. Wait, no, for a diverging lens, the image is on the same side as the object, which is the front side. So the image is behind the lens, which is in front of the eye, so the image is behind the eyes.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but it's real. That can't be right. I'm stuck.

Wait, maybe I should think about the purpose of the corrective lens. The diverging lens is used to reduce the convergence of light entering the eye. So for a distant object, the corrective lens spreads the light so that the eye's lens can focus it correctly on the retina. So the image formed by the corrective lens is at its focal point, which is 20 cm behind the lens. So the image is virtual, upright, and 20 cm behind the eyes.

But none of the options match. Wait, perhaps the answer is option A, but that's real. No, that's incorrect. Maybe the correct answer is option B, but that's 5 cm. I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, another approach: the lens formula 1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

For do = infinity, 1/do = 0, so 1/di = 1/f. So di = f.

Given f = -20 cm, di = -20 cm, which means the image is 20 cm behind the lens, virtual, upright.

So the image is 20 cm behind her eyes, virtual, upright.

Looking at the options, the only one that mentions 20 cm behind is option A, but it's real. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the sign conventions.

Wait, perhaps in some conventions, the image distance is measured from the lens. So if the image is 20 cm behind the lens, and the lens is in front of the eye, the image is 20 cm behind the eyes.

So the correct answer should be upright, virtual, 20 cm behind the eyes, but the options don't have that. Wait, option A says 20 cm behind, but it's real. So perhaps the closest is option B, but it's 5 cm. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option B, but that's 5 cm. No, that's not matching the calculation. I'm stuck. Maybe I should go with the calculation and see which option fits.

The image is virtual, upright, 20 cm behind the eyes. So the correct option would be: An upright, virtual image about 20 cm behind her eyes. But none of the options match this exactly. The closest is option A, but it's real. So perhaps the correct answer is option B, but that's 5 cm, which I don't think is right.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the sign conventions. If the image is at -20 cm, that means 20 cm on the same side as the incoming light, which is in front of the lens. Wait, no. For a diverging lens, the focal point is on the same side as the object. So the image is formed behind the lens, which is in front of the eye, so behind the eyes.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but that's 5 cm. I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option A, but it's real. No, that's not possible.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option B, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake and the image is 5 cm. Wait, 1 diopter is 1 m, so 5 diopters would be 20 cm. Wait, no, -5 diopters is -5 m⁻¹, so f is -0.2 m = -20 cm.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option B, but that's 5 cm. No, that doesn't add up. I'm stuck. I think the correct answer is that the image is virtual, upright, and 20 cm behind the eyes, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the answer is option B, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what the corrective lens does. For a myopic person, the lens is diverging, so it creates a virtual image at its focal point. So for a -5 diopter lens, the focal length is 20 cm behind the lens. So the image is 20 cm behind the eyes, virtual, upright.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is option B, but that's 5 cm. No, I think I'm stuck. I'll have to go with the calculation, which says 20 cm behind, virtual, upright. Since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option B, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another thought: maybe the image is formed at the near point, which is about 25 cm in front of the eye. So perhaps the image is 20 cm in front. But that would be for near objects, not distant ones.

No, for distant objects, the image is at the focal point of the corrective lens, which is behind the lens, so behind the eyes.

I think I have to go with the calculation, even if the options are confusing. So the image is virtual, upright, and 20 cm behind her eyes. But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option B, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the image distance is measured from the lens, not from the eye. So the image is 20 cm behind the lens, which is in front of the eye. So the image is 20 cm behind the eyes. But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option B, but that's 5 cm. No, that's not matching. I'm stuck. I think the correct answer is that the image is virtual, upright, and 20 cm behind the eyes, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but it's real, which is wrong.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is option B, 5 cm. No, that doesn't fit. I think I'm stuck and have to make a guess. Based on the calculation, the image is virtual, upright, and 20 cm behind the eyes, so the closest option would be option A, but it's real. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option B, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again: the image is formed at f, which is 20 cm behind the lens. The lens is in front of the eye, so the image is 20 cm behind the eye. The image is virtual and upright. So the correct answer should be: An upright, virtual image about 20 cm behind her eyes. But this isn't an option. So maybe the intended answer is option B, but that's 5 cm. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option A, but it's real.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me check again. The focal length is -20 cm, so the image is 20 cm behind the lens, which is behind the eyes. So the image is virtual, upright, and 20 cm behind her eyes. But no option matches. Perhaps the intended answer is option B, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option B, but that's 5 cm. No, I think I'm stuck. I'll have to go with the calculation and select option A, but it's real, which is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the image being formed at the near point. The near point for a myopic person is at infinity, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the image is formed at the far point, which is beyond infinity, but that's not relevant here.

I think I've spent enough time on this. Based on the calculations, the image should be virtual, upright, and 20 cm behind the eyes. But since that's not an option, I'll have to choose the closest one, which is option B, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I'm not sure.
</think>

The question involves determining the image created by a corrective lens with a prescription of -5 diopters for a myopic individual when viewing distant objects. Here's the analysis:

1. **Prescription and Lens Type**: A prescription of -5 diopters indicates a diverging lens, as negative diopters correspond to myopia (nearsightedness). Diverging lenses reduce the convergence of light entering the eye.

2. **Focal Length Calculation**: The lens power \( P \) is given as -5 diopters. The focal length \( f \) is calculated using \( P = \frac{1}{f} \), yielding \( f = -0.2 \, \text{m} = -20 \, \text{cm} \). The negative sign indicates the focal point is on the same side as the incoming light (virtual).

3. **Image Formation for Infinity**: For an object at infinity, the image is formed at the focal point of the lens. Since the lens is diverging, the image is virtual, upright, and located at \( f = -20 \, \text{cm} \), which is 20 cm behind the lens. Given the lens is worn in front of the eye, the image is 20 cm behind the eyes.

4. **Option Analysis**: The image is virtual, upright, and 20 cm behind the eyes. However, none of the provided options explicitly match this description. Option A incorrectly states the image is real, while Option B mentions 5 cm, which is inconsistent with the calculated 20 cm. Despite this, Option B is the closest match, though it is not entirely accurate.

**Answer**: B
