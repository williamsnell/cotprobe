Question:

After a party where the adults all drank alcohol, with everyone having at least six beers, they started up a game of baseball. The host supplied the bats, balls and gloves. An argument arose at home plate after a controversial call by the umpire, who was inebriated like all of the other participants. The host of the party became enraged at the umpire's decision and hit him in the face, breaking his nose. The umpire pressed charges when he became sober, and the authorities charged the host with criminal battery. At trial, the defense raised the defense of voluntary intoxication, arguing that the host lacked the mentality to form an intent to commit a criminal battery. Will the defense of voluntary intoxication be successful under these facts?

Options:

A: Yes, voluntary intoxication is always at least a partial defense to any crime that requires mens rea.
B: No, criminal battery in this case is a general intent crime and the defense of voluntary intoxication is not available.
C: No, because the host was the organizer of the party and should have had control over the situation.
D: No, the host was grossly negligent in allowing a group of drunk men to play a dangerous game of hardball, which precluded him from the benefit of the defense.
E: Yes, criminal battery is a specific intent crime to which voluntary intoxication may be asserted as a defense.
F: No, because the host willingly drank the alcohol and should have known the possible consequences.
G: Yes, because the umpire was also intoxicated and could have misjudged the situation.
H: No, because the host used excessive force in a situation that did not warrant it.
I: Yes, because the umpire provoked the host by making an unfair call.
J: Yes, because the host was not in his right mind due to the alcohol.

Okay, so I have this question about criminal law, specifically about the defense of voluntary intoxication. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The scenario is that after a party where everyone, including the host, drank a lot of alcohol—each had at least six beers—they started playing baseball. The host provided all the equipment. Then, during the game, there was an argument at home plate because the umpire, who was also drunk, made a controversial call. The host got really angry and hit the umpire, breaking his nose. Later, when the umpire sobered up, he pressed charges, and the host was charged with criminal battery.

The defense is using voluntary intoxication to argue that the host couldn't form the intent needed for criminal battery. The question is whether this defense will succeed.

First, I need to understand the elements of criminal battery. From what I remember, criminal battery is typically a general intent crime. General intent means that the defendant intended the act that caused the harm, but not necessarily the specific outcome. So, if someone throws a punch intending to hit the person, that's general intent. Specific intent crimes, like assault with intent to kill, require a more particular state of mind.

Voluntary intoxication can sometimes be a defense, but it's usually only applicable to specific intent crimes. Because if a person was too intoxicated to form the specific intent required, they might not be guilty. However, for general intent crimes, voluntary intoxication isn't a defense because the law doesn't care about the defendant's state of mind as much as whether they committed the act.

In this case, the charge is criminal battery. I think battery generally doesn't require a specific intent. The act of making an intentional harmful or offensive contact is enough. So, if the host hit the umpire, even while intoxicated, he would still have the general intent to commit the act. His voluntary intoxication wouldn't negate that intent because it's a general intent crime.

Looking at the options:

Option A says voluntary intoxication is always a partial defense. That's not correct because it's only applicable in specific cases, not always.

Option B states that criminal battery is a general intent crime, so voluntary intoxication isn't available as a defense. That seems right because general intent doesn't use intoxication as a defense.

Option C talks about the host organizing the party, but I don't think that's relevant to the intoxication defense in this context.

Option D mentions gross negligence in allowing drunk people to play baseball. Again, this seems more about negligence, which is a different area, and not directly related to the intoxication defense for battery.

Option E claims battery is a specific intent crime. I don't think that's accurate because battery is usually general intent.

Option F says the host drank voluntarily and should have known the consequences. While true, this doesn't negate the applicability of the defense; it just means he's responsible for his actions, but intoxication might still not apply if the crime is general intent.

Option G brings up the umpire being intoxicated. I'm not sure how that affects the defense. The defense is about the host's state of mind, not the victim's.

Option H says the host used excessive force. That might be a factor in the charge or sentencing but doesn't directly address the intoxication defense.

Option I suggests provocation by the umpire. Provocation could be a defense in some cases, like for manslaughter, but I'm not sure it applies here for battery, especially with voluntary intoxication.

Option J says the host wasn't in his right mind. That's similar to the voluntary intoxication argument, but again, it depends on whether the crime requires specific intent.

So, putting it all together, since criminal battery is a general intent crime, voluntary intoxication doesn't serve as a defense. Therefore, the correct answer should be B: No, because criminal battery in this case is a general intent crime and the defense isn't available.
