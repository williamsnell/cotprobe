Question:

The city installed a sewer line across a residential subdivision. The city acquired a valid easement for construction of the sewer from the development company that owned the subdivision. One year later a buyer purchased a house within the subdivision. Unknown to the buyer, the sewer line ran across his property, approximately 10 feet beneath the foundation of his home. The deed that the buyer received from the grantor, the development company, made no mention of the easement. Ten years after the buyer purchased his house, a crack in the sewer line caused water to leak into the buyer's basement. The flooding resulted in extensive damage to his home. The city has abolished governmental immunity. In an appropriate action by the buyer against the city to recover damages, the plaintiff will probably

Options:

A: prevail, only if the sewer line was negligently maintained.
B: prevail, because the city has abolished governmental immunity.
C: prevail, because the city failed to disclose the presence of the sewer line.
D: prevail, only if the city was aware of the crack in the sewer line.
E: not prevail, because the damage was not foreseeable.
F: not prevail, because the sewer line was installed before the buyer purchased the property.
G: prevail, because under the circumstances, the sewer line constituted a public nuisance.
H: not prevail, because the deed did not mention the easement.
I: not prevail, because the city had acquired a valid easement for the sewer line.
J: not prevail, because the easement was acquired legally.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about property law, specifically dealing with easements and governmental immunity. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The situation is that a city installed a sewer line across a residential subdivision. They got a valid easement from the development company that owned the subdivision. A year later, a buyer bought a house there without knowing about the sewer line, which is 10 feet beneath the foundation. The deed didn't mention the easement. Then, ten years later, a crack in the sewer caused water to leak into the basement, causing extensive damage. The city has abolished governmental immunity, so the buyer is suing them.

The question is asking what the outcome will probably be. The options are A through J.

First, I need to recall what an easement is. An easement is a non-possessory right to use another's land for a specific purpose. Here, the city has an easement, so they have the legal right to maintain the sewer line across the property, even after the subdivision is sold.

The buyer didn't know about the easement because the deed didn't mention it. But when you buy a property, you're generally bound by any existing easements, even if they're not listed in the deed. So the presence of the sewer line is a valid easement on the buyer's property.

Now, the city has governmental immunity abolished. Normally, governments have immunity from lawsuits unless they're negligent or in some cases where they've waived immunity. So if the city has abolished their immunity, maybe the buyer can sue them for negligence.

But the key here is whether the city's actions were negligent. The sewer line was installed with a valid easement, so the initial installation was legal. The issue arises when the sewer line cracked. The question is whether the city was negligent in maintaining the sewer line or whether the damage was foreseeable.

Looking at the options:

A: Prevail only if the sewer line was negligently maintained. So this suggests that if the city didn't maintain it properly, they could be liable. But the question doesn't specify if the city was negligent in maintenance; it just says there was a crack. So maybe this is a possibility.

B: Prevail because the city has abolished immunity. But having abolished immunity doesn't automatically mean they're liable. The city still needs to be negligent or have some liability for the damage.

C: Prevail because the city failed to disclose the presence. But the buyer is bound by the easement regardless of disclosure. So the city isn't required to disclose it to each homeowner unless they were the original grantor. The development company, not the city, sold the property, so the city's lack of disclosure isn't relevant here.

D: Prevail only if the city was aware of the crack. If the city didn't know about the crack, maybe they weren't negligent. But if the crack caused damage, the city might be liable for failing to maintain the sewer, regardless of prior awareness.

E: Not prevail because the damage wasn't foreseeable. Foreseeability is a key element in negligence. If the installation of the sewer line was proper, and the failure was due to normal wear and tear or unforeseen circumstances, the city might not be liable. But if the crack was due to poor maintenance, it could be foreseeable.

F: Not prevail because the line was installed before purchase. This seems incorrect. The fact that it was installed before doesn't mean the city isn't liable for subsequent damage if they were negligent after the buyer purchased.

G: Prevail because it's a public nuisance. A nuisance requires that the activity is unreasonable and causes significant harm. An easement for a sewer is a normal public utility, so it's unlikely to be considered a nuisance unless the situation is extraordinary, which isn't indicated here.

H: Not prevail because the deed didn't mention it. As I thought earlier, the buyer is still bound by the easement regardless of the deed. So this option is incorrect.

I: Not prevail because the city had a valid easement. This seems correct because the city had the right to install the sewer line, and the buyer is subject to that easement. The fact that the sewer caused damage doesn't negate the validity of the easement. However, the city's liability could still arise if they were negligent in maintaining it.

J: Not prevail because the easement was legally acquired. Similar to I, the easement was valid, so the city isn't liable just because they have the easement. But again, the issue is whether their maintenance was negligent.

So the key points are whether the city is liable under the circumstances. The fact that the city has abolished immunity means they can be sued, but the buyer must show negligence.

If the city had a valid easement, they are allowed to have the sewer line, but they might still be liable if they didn't maintain it properly. So if the crack was due to the city's negligence in maintaining the line, the buyer could prevail (option A). But if the crack was due to normal aging or something unforeseen, the city might not be negligent.

Alternatively, the fact that the city had a valid easement (options I and J) would mean the buyer can't argue against the existence of the sewer line. The damage comes from the crack, but if the city wasn't negligent in causing or allowing the crack, they aren't liable.

I think the correct answer is I or J, because the city had a legal right to the easement. But looking at the options, I says "not prevail because the city had acquired a valid easement," and J says "not prevail because the easement was acquired legally."

Hmm. The issue is whether the city's action in maintaining the sewer line caused the damage. If the city had a valid easement, they can install and maintain it, but if their maintenance was negligent, they could be liable. So the presence of the easement doesn't automatically protect them from liability for negligence in maintenance.

So if the buyer can prove the city was negligent in maintaining the sewer line, they might prevail (option A). But without knowing if the city was negligent, the answer might default to I or J because the easement was valid, so the city isn't liable for the mere existence of the line.

But the question says the city has abolished immunity, so if the city was negligent, the buyer could sue. The question is about whether the buyer will probably prevail. The fact that the easement was valid (I and J) doesn't necessarily mean the city wasn't negligent.

Wait, but the buyer didn't know about the easement, but that doesn't matter because the easement runs with the land. The buyer is still subject to it. The city's installation was proper, but the question is about the crack ten years later.

So the buyer's claim would be based on negligence in maintenance. If the city was negligent, they could be liable. But the question doesn't specify whether the city was negligent. So perhaps the correct answer is that the buyer won't prevail because the city had a valid easement, so the installation and maintenance are protected, unless there's negligence.

But the options don't address whether the city was negligent. So the possible answers are I or J, which say the buyer won't prevail because the easement was validly acquired.

Alternatively, the fact that the city had immunity abolished allows the buyer to sue, but the buyer needs to prove negligence. Since the question doesn't say the city was negligent, maybe the answer is I or J.

Wait, the question says the city "installed a sewer line across a residential subdivision. The city acquired a valid easement..." So the easement was properly acquired. The issue is whether the city's actions after that (like maintenance) were negligent.

If the buyer is suing because of the crack, which caused damage, the city might be liable if they were negligent in maintaining the line. But the question doesn't give enough info to say whether they were negligent. So perhaps the answer hinges on the fact that the city had a valid easement, so the buyer can't complain about the existence, but can about the maintenance.

But the options don't all address that. Option A says prevail only if negligently maintained. So if the buyer can prove that, they win. But without knowing, the answer might be that the buyer can't prevail because the easement was valid (I or J).

Alternatively, since the city is not immune, the buyer can sue, but the existence of the easement doesn't bar the negligence claim. So the buyer's success depends on proving negligence, not just the existence of the easement.

So looking at the options, I think the correct answer is I: not prevail because the city had acquired a valid easement. Or J: same reasoning.

Wait, the difference between I and J: I says "not prevail because the city had acquired a valid easement for the sewer line." J says "not prevail, because the easement was acquired legally."

I think both are correct, but the answer might be I or J. Since both options are present, perhaps the correct answer is I. But I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is A: prevail only if the sewer line was negligently maintained. Because the city's liability is based on negligence in maintenance, not the easement itself.

But the question is whether the buyer will probably prevail. Since the city has abolished immunity, they can be sued. But whether they are liable depends on negligence. The question doesn't specify negligence, so perhaps the answer is that the buyer won't prevail because the city had a valid easement (I or J).

I think the answer is I: not prevail because the city had acquired a valid easement.

The situation involves a buyer suing the city for damages caused by a cracked sewer line beneath their home. The city had a valid easement for the sewer line, which was acquired before the buyer purchased the property. The city has abolished governmental immunity, allowing the buyer to sue for negligence. However, the buyer's success depends on proving that the city was negligent in maintaining the sewer line. The presence of a valid easement does not automatically bar the buyer's claim but is relevant to the city's right to install and maintain the sewer line. Without specific evidence of negligence, the buyer is unlikely to prevail.
