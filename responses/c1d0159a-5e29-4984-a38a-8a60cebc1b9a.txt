Question:

A women feeds her new cat daily with canned cat food. As she opens the cans with a noisy electric can opener, she calls the cat. The cat comes in response, to its name, and the woman feeds it. Why does the cat eventually come running when it hears the electric can opener?

Options:

A: The cat believes that the can opener itself is a toy.
B: The cat has learned that the can opener noise means someone is in the kitchen.
C: The cat recognizes the can opener as a signal that its owner is nearby.
D: The cat enjoys the routine of the feeding process and the sound signifies the start.
E: The cat is trained to respond to the sound of the can opener.
F: The cat is attracted by the noise of the can opener.
G: The cat likes the sound of the can opener.
H: The cat has associated the sound of the can opener with the presentation of food.
I: The cat is curious about the source of the noise and comes to investigate.
J: The cat has been conditioned to come for a treat whenever it hears any electrical appliance.

Okay, so I've got this question about why a cat comes running when it hears an electric can opener. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is a woman feeding her new cat daily with canned food. Every time she opens the can, she uses a noisy electric can opener. When she does that, she calls the cat, and the cat comes to its name and gets fed. The question is asking why the cat eventually comes running when it hears the can opener.

Hmm, so I think it's about classical conditioning or associative learning. The cat probably starts to link the sound of the can opener with getting food. Let me consider the options.

Option A says the cat thinks the can opener is a toy. That doesn't seem right because the cat is responding to the sound, not the object itself. It's more about the association with food.

Option B suggests the cat knows the noise means someone's in the kitchen. That might be part of it, but the main reason the cat comes is probably because of the food, not just the presence of someone.

Option C states the cat recognizes the noise as a signal the owner is nearby. Again, while that's true, the key here is the food that follows. The owner's presence is a signal for food.

Option D says the cat enjoys the feeding routine and the sound starts it. This could make sense, but I think the primary association is the sound leading to food, not just the routine.

Option E claims the cat is trained to respond to the sound. Training usually implies intentional teaching, but here it's more about the cat learning through association on its own.

Option F suggests the cat is attracted by the noise. Some cats might be curious about the noise, but the consistent response is because the noise predicts food.

Option G says the cat likes the sound. Similar to F, it's about the sound itself, but the real reason is the food.

Option H states the cat associates the can opener sound with food presentation. This seems spot on because every time the can opener is used, food is given. So the cat learns that sound = food.

Option I says the cat is curious about the noise and comes to investigate. While curiosity might bring the cat initially, the consistent behavior is due to the expectation of food.

Option J suggests the cat is conditioned to come for a treat when hearing any electrical appliance. That's a bit broader than necessary. The can opener specifically is linked to food, not all electrical sounds.

So, putting it all together, the cat has learned that the can opener's noise reliably predicts that food is about to be given. Therefore, the correct answer should be H.

The cat has associated the sound of the can opener with the presentation of food.

Answer: H
