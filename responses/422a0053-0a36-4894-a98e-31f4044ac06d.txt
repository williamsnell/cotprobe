Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about distribution constants and phase separation. Hmm, let me try to think this through step by step. 

The question says that a solute is added to a two-phase mixture where the components are immiscible in all proportions. The distribution constant, K_d, is 508. I need to find the fraction of the solute in phase B at equilibrium.

Wait, I remember that the distribution constant (Kd) is the ratio of the concentration of the solute in one phase to the other. So, Kd = [A]/[B], where A and B are the two phases. Oh, right, Kd is the concentration in phase A divided by phase B.

Since the problem is asking for the fraction in phase B, I think I should express [B] in terms of [A]. Let me rearrange that. If Kd = [A]/[B], then [B] = [A]/Kd.

But wait, fractions of the solute... I think the total amount of solute is divided between the two phases. So, the total concentration is [A] + [B], and I need to find the fraction in B.

Let me define the total solute as T. So, T = [A] + [B]. 

But from Kd, [A] = Kd * [B]. So substituting that into T, we get T = Kd * [B] + [B] = [B] (Kd + 1). 

So, [B] = T / (Kd + 1). Therefore, the fraction of solute in phase B is [B]/T = 1/(Kd + 1).

Wait, that makes sense. Because if Kd is much larger than 1, most of the solute will be in phase A, and if Kd is close to 1, it's more evenly distributed.

Given Kd is 508, which is a large number. So the denominator is 508 + 1 = 509. So the fraction is 1/509.

Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 509. Hmm, 509 is approximately 500, so 1/500 is 0.002, or 2e-3. But 509 is a bit more than 500, so the value will be a little less than 0.002.

Wait, let me compute it accurately. 509 times 2 is 1018, so 1/509 is approximately 0.00196. Hmm, which is about 1.96 × 10^-3.

Looking at the options, option I is 1.96 ×10^-3. Option E is 2.08e-3, which is a bit higher. Option C is 2.11e-3, also higher. Option H is 1.8e-3, lower.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation. 509 × 0.00196. Let's see: 500 * 0.00196 = 0.98, and 9 * 0.00196 is about 0.01764. So total is 0.99764, which is close to 1. So 0.00196 is correct.

So the fraction in phase B is approximately 1.96e-3. That would be option I.

To determine the fraction of the solute in phase B, we use the distribution constant \( K_d = 508 \). The fraction of the solute in phase B is given by \( \frac{1}{K_d + 1} \). Substituting \( K_d = 508 \), we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{508 + 1} = \frac{1}{509} \approx 1.96 \times 10^{-3}
\]

This matches option I. 

Answer: I
