Question:

A placebo-controlled clinical trial is conducted to assess whether a new antihypertensive drug is more effective than standard therapy. A total of 5000 patients with essential hypertension are enrolled and randomly assigned to one of two groups: 2500 patients receive the new drug and 2500 patients receive placebo. If the alpha is set at 0.01 instead of 0.05, which of the following is the most likely result?

Options:

A: The study will have less power
B: The study will require fewer participants
C: There is an increased likelihood of statistically significant findings
D: The study will be less reliable
E: Significant findings can be reported with greater confidence
F: The placebo effect will be more pronounced
G: The study will have more power
H: There is a decreased likelihood of statistically significant findings

Okay, so I've got this question about a clinical trial and statistics. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is about a placebo-controlled trial where a new antihypertensive drug is compared to standard therapy. They enrolled 5000 patients, split equally into two groups. The main point is about changing the alpha level from 0.05 to 0.01. I need to figure out what effect this change has on the study.

First, I remember that alpha (Î±) is the significance level, which is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it's actually true. So, a lower alpha means we're less likely to make a Type I error, which is incorrectly saying there's an effect when there isn't one.

When the alpha is set at 0.01 instead of 0.05, it's more stringent. That means the threshold for statistical significance is higher. So, the study is now more conservative in declaring results as significant.

Looking at the options:

A: The study will have less power. Power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when there is an effect. Lower alpha can reduce power because with a stricter cutoff, it's harder to detect a true effect. So if alpha is lower, power might go down, but that depends on other factors like sample size. Since the sample size here is fixed (5000), reducing alpha would decrease power. So option A could be correct.

B: The study will require fewer participants. I don't think so. The sample size is already fixed at 5000. Changing alpha doesn't directly affect the required sample size unless you're calculating it beforehand. Here, they've already enrolled, so B is probably not right.

C: Increased likelihood of significant findings. No, because a lower alpha makes it harder to get significant results. So C is incorrect.

D: The study will be less reliable. Reliability is about consistency, not directly tied to alpha. So D might not be the right choice.

E: Significant findings can be reported with greater confidence. Hmm, yes, because a lower alpha reduces the chance of a Type I error, so if you do find significance, you can be more confident it's real. But the question is about the most likely result when alpha is set lower, so perhaps E is correct. But wait, the question is about what happens when alpha is set lower, not about interpreting the results after the fact.

F: Placebo effect more pronounced. I don't see how changing alpha affects the placebo effect. So F is probably irrelevant.

G: The study will have more power. Power is affected by alpha, sample size, effect size, etc. Lower alpha generally reduces power because you're less likely to reject the null. So G is incorrect.

H: Decreased likelihood of significant findings. Yes, because a lower alpha makes it harder to achieve statistical significance. So H seems correct.

Wait, but the question is asking which is the most likely result when alpha is set at 0.01 instead of 0.05. So if alpha is lower, the probability of getting a statistically significant result (rejecting the null) decreases. So H is correct.

Another angle: Power is the ability to detect a true effect. If alpha is lower, with a fixed sample size, the power decreases. So A says less power, which would also be correct. But the options are about the result of changing alpha, not directly about power.

But the options are about what happens when alpha is set lower. So the primary effect is that it's harder to get significant results, so H is the answer. Alternatively, the study's power would decrease, making A correct. But the question is about the result of the trial, not the study's design.

Wait, the question says "which of the following is the most likely result?" So when you set alpha at 0.01, which is more strict, you're less likely to get a significant finding. So H is correct.

So the answer should be H.
</think>

When the alpha level is set at 0.01 instead of 0.05, the threshold for statistical significance becomes stricter. This makes it harder to reject the null hypothesis, thereby decreasing the likelihood of obtaining statistically significant findings. Therefore, the most likely result is a decreased likelihood of statistically significant findings.

Answer: H
