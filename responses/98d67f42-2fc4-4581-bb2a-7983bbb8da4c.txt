Okay, so I've got this question about the strength of a 90° pulse in a 13C NMR experiment. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, from what I remember, a 90° pulse is used in NMR to flip the spin of the nucleus from the equilibrium state to a higher energy state. The strength of the pulse, B1, is related to the resonance frequency and the pulse duration.

Wait, the formula I think I need is B1 equals the resonance frequency (ω) multiplied by the pulse duration (τ) divided by 2π. So, B1 = (ω * τ) / (2π). Does that sound right? I think so because the resonance condition for a 90° pulse involves the Larmor frequency.

Now, the question gives me that the pulse is for 13C, which has a different resonance frequency than protons. I remember that the Larmor frequency for carbon-13 is lower than that of proton. Let me recall the approximate values. For protons, the Larmor frequency at, say, 21.2 MHz for a 3 Tesla magnet. But carbon is different. Oh right, 13C typically resonates around 10-12 ppm when using a proton frequency as a reference. Wait, wait. Let's think in terms of MHz.

Wait, no, the Larmor frequency (ω) is given by ω = γ * B0, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. But perhaps I should look up the exact resonance frequency for 13C. Alternatively, I might remember that the 13C resonance frequency is about 4.775 MHz when using a 3 Tesla magnet. Because at 3 Tesla, protons resonate around 123 MHz, and 13C is about 1/25th of that, so 123 / 25 is roughly 4.92 MHz. Close enough.

So, ω for 13C is approximately 4.775 MHz. Let me write that down: ω ≈ 4.775e6 radians per second? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1 MHz is 1e6 Hz, and since ω is 2π times the frequency, so 4.775 MHz would be 4.775e6 Hz. But wait, no, wait—no. Wait a minute, I'm getting confused. Wait, the resonance frequency in Hz is f = ω/(2π). So if 13C resonates at, say, 4.775e6 Hz (4.775 MHz), then ω would be 2π times that. So ω = 2π * 4.775e6 ≈ 3e7 rad/s? Let me compute that. 4.775e6 Hz multiplied by 2π is about 30,000,000 rad/s, yeah.

Wait, but maybe I should get the exact value. Let me think: the gyromagnetic ratio for 13C is γ = 2.507e7 rad T−1 s−1. Oh, wait, I think that's right. So, γ_13C = 2.507e7 rad/(T·s). So, if the magnetic field B0 is 3 Tesla, then ω = γ * B0 = 2.507e7 * 3 ≈ 7.521e7 rad/s. Wait, that's significantly higher than my previous estimate. Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me make sure.

Wait, no, perhaps I got it mixed up. Because the resonance frequency f is given by f = γ * B0 / (2π). So for 13C, γ is 2.507e7 rad/(T·s), so f = (2.507e7 * B0) / (2π). If B0 is 3 T, then f ≈ (2.507e7 * 3) / (6.283) ≈ (7.521e7) / 6.283 ≈ approx 1.197e7 Hz, which is 11.97 MHz. Wait, that can't be right because I thought 13C is lower than proton's 123 MHz. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the wrong γ value. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I confused 13C with something else. Let me think: the gyromagnetic ratio for 1H is about 267.5 MHz per Tesla. So for 13C, it's much lower. Wait, according to my notes, the gyromagnetic ratio for 13C is about 2.507e7 rad/(T·s), which is equivalent to about 4.002 ppm in terms of MHz per Tesla. So, for a 3 T magnet, 13C's resonance frequency would be 4.002 * 3 ≈ 12.006 MHz. Wait, that seems high because I thought 13C is lower than 1H's 123 MHz. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused between parts per million and actual frequencies.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's think about the formula. The 90° pulse duration τ is related to the resonance frequency. The formula for the 90° pulse width is τ = π/(2ω), where ω is the Larmor frequency in radians per second. So, if I can find ω for 13C, I can compute τ.

Wait, but the question gives τ as 1 μs, which is 1e-6 seconds. So, rearranging the formula, τ = π/(2ω) → ω = π/(2τ). So ω = π/(2 * 1e-6) = π / 2e-6 ≈ (3.1416)/(2e-6) ≈ 1.5708e6 radians per second. Wait, but that seems too low because the 13C Larmor frequency should be in the MHz range, which is 1e6 Hz, so ω would be 2π times that, so roughly 6e7 rad/s. Hmm, I'm getting conflicting numbers here.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong. Let me think again. The 90° pulse duration τ is τ = (π/2) / ω, because the area under the pulse needs to be π/2 for a 90° rotation. So τ = (π/2) / ω. Therefore, ω = (π/2) / τ.

So with τ = 1e-6 seconds, ω = (3.1416/2) / 1e-6 ≈ 1.5708e6 rad/s. But that's only about 1.57 MHz in terms of frequency (since f = ω/(2π)), which is f ≈ 250 kHz. But that's way too low for 13C, which should be around 10-12 MHz. So maybe I'm misunderstanding something here.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the concepts. Let me think: the 90° pulse at resonance requires that the RF pulse has a certain amplitude. The strength B1 is given by B1 = (ω * τ) / (2π). So, if I can calculate ω, then I can find B1.

But wait, the question is about the strength B1 of the pulse. So, perhaps I need to compute B1, given that the pulse is for 13C and is 90°, with τ=1 μs.

Wait, but how do I get ω for 13C? Let me try to find the correct value for the Larmor frequency of 13C at 3 Tesla. From NMR knowledge, I remember that for a 3 T magnet, 1H resonates around 123 MHz, and 13C resonates at about 10.6 ppm relative to 1H. So 10.6 ppm of 123 MHz is 123e6 * 10.6e-6 ≈ 1307.8 MHz? That can't be right because 13C is much lower than 1H. Wait, no, ppm is parts per million, so 13C is at 10.6 ppm relative to 1H, which is 123 MHz. So 10.6 ppm is 10.6e-6 of 123e6 Hz, which is 123e6 * 10.6e-6 = 1307.8 Hz. That's about 1.3 kHz. That seems way too low.

Wait, that can't be right because I've read that 13C NMR at 3 T typically has a resonance frequency around 100-120 MHz. Hmm, I must be making a mistake here. Let me check: 1H is about 42.58 MHz/T, so at 3 T, that's 127.74 MHz. For 13C, the gyromagnetic ratio is about 4.002 ppm relative to 1H. So 4.002 ppm of 127.74 MHz is 127.74e6 Hz * 4.002e-6 ≈ 511 Hz. That's still too low. Wait, that can't be correct because I've seen 13C NMR spectra with frequencies in the 100 MHz range.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing ppm in terms of something else. Let me think again. The chemical shift of 13C is usually reported relative to a standard, like TMS, but the actual resonance frequency is determined by the gyromagnetic ratio and the magnetic field. The gyromagnetic ratio for 13C is γ = 2.507e7 rad/(T·s), which is about 4.002e3 Hz/T. So, for a magnetic field of B0 = 3 T, the resonance frequency f is γ * B0 / (2π) = (2.507e7 * 3) / (6.283) ≈ 7.521e7 / 6.283 ≈ 1.197e7 Hz, which is 11.97 MHz. So, f ≈ 12 MHz.

Wait, that makes sense. So ω = 2π * f = 2π * 12e6 ≈ 7.54e7 rad/s.

Now, going back to the formula for B1. The formula is B1 = (ω * τ) / (2π). So plugging in the numbers:

ω = 7.54e7 rad/s
τ = 1e-6 s
So B1 = (7.54e7 * 1e-6) / (2π) ≈ (75.4) / (6.283) ≈ approx 12.0 mT.

Wait, but let me compute that more accurately: 75.4 divided by 6.283 is about 12.0 mT.

Looking at the options, option H is 12.5 mT, which is close. Hmm, but maybe I made a rounding error. Let me check the calculations again.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is B1 = (ω * τ) / (2π). Let me compute that again.

ω = 2π * f, so ω = 2π * 12e6 ≈ 75,398,223.6 rad/s.

Then τ = 1e-6 s.

So, ω * τ = 75,398,223.6 * 1e-6 ≈ 75.3982236.

Then, divide by 2π: 75.3982236 / (2 * 3.14159265) ≈ 75.3982236 / 6.2831853 ≈ approx 12.0 mT.

But the options don't have exactly 12.0 mT. Option H is 12.5 mT, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a more precise value for f.

Wait, perhaps I should get a more precise value for the resonance frequency of 13C. Let me think: the gyromagnetic ratio for 13C is 2.507e7 rad/(T·s), so for B0 = 3 T,

ω = 2.507e7 * 3 = 7.521e7 rad/s.

Then f = ω/(2π) = 7.521e7 / (6.283) ≈ 11.97e6 Hz, which is 11.97 MHz.

So, ω = 7.521e7 rad/s.

Now, B1 = (ω * τ) / (2π) = (7.521e7 * 1e-6) / (6.283) ≈ (75.21) / 6.283 ≈ 12.0 mT.

Hmm, but none of the options is exactly 12.0 mT. The closest is H: 12.5 mT. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Another thought: perhaps the formula is B1 = (ω * τ) / (2). Let me think about the units. ω is in rad/s, τ is seconds. So ω*τ is dimensionless (rad), and to get B1 in Tesla, we need to divide by 2π for the rotation angle. Because a 90° pulse is π/2 radians. So the area under the pulse (integral of B1(t) dt) should be π/2.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is B1 = (ω * τ) / (2π) * (π/2) )? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the correct condition for a 90° pulse is that the integral of the B1 field over time equals π/2. So, ∫ B1(t) dt = π/2. If the pulse is a square pulse, B1(t) = B1 for duration τ, so B1 * τ = π/2. Therefore, B1 = (π/2) / τ.

Wait, that would make B1 = (π)/(2τ). So, plugging in τ = 1e-6 s,

B1 = (3.1416)/(2 * 1e-6) ≈ 1.5708e6 / 1e6 = 1.5708e0 ≈ 1.5708 Tesla? That can't be right because that's way too high. Wait, that's impossible because typical B1 fields are in the mT range.

Wait, I must be messing up the formula here. Let me think again. The condition for a 90° pulse is that the area under the B1 pulse (integral of B1 dt) equals π/2. So, Area = B1 * τ = π/2.

So, B1 = (π/2) / τ.

But with τ = 1 μs, that gives B1 = (1.5708) / 1e-6 = 1.5708e6 Tesla. That's 1.57 million Tesla, which is impossible. So clearly, I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor related to the Larmor frequency. Let me see. The correct formula, I think, is B1 = (ω * τ) / (2π). Because the energy from the pulse is related to the rotation angle. So, the rotation angle θ is given by θ = (ω * τ * B1) / (2π). For a 90° pulse, θ = π/2 radians.

So, π/2 = (ω * τ * B1) / (2π).

Rearranging, B1 = (π/2) * 2π / (ω * τ) ) → B1 = (π^2) / (ω * τ).

Wait, that seems off. Let me try again.

Wait, the equation for the rotation angle is θ = (ω * τ * B1) / (2π). So,

θ = (ω * τ * B1) / (2π).

We want θ = π/2 radians.

So,

π/2 = (ω * τ * B1) / (2π).

Multiply both sides by 2π:

π^2 = ω * τ * B1.

So,

B1 = π^2 / (ω * τ).

Now, substituting the numbers:

ω = 7.521e7 rad/s,

τ = 1e-6 s,

So,

B1 = (9.8696) / (7.521e7 * 1e-6) = 9.8696 / (75.21) ≈ 0.1312 Tesla, which is 131.2 mT. That's way too high, which can't be right because typical B1 values are in the mT range, maybe up to 100 mT but not over 100 mT.

Wait, that can't be correct. There's something wrong with my approach here. Let me try a different method.

Another approach: The 90° pulse condition is that the product of the resonance frequency (in Hz) and the pulse duration (in seconds) equals 0.5. So, f * τ = 0.5. But wait, that would give the correct condition for a 90° pulse in terms of frequency and time.

Wait, so f * τ = 0.5 → τ = 1/(2f).

But wait, let me think. For a 90° pulse, the condition is that the area under the B1 pulse is π/2. The area is B1 * τ. But B1 is related to the resonance frequency. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too tangled.

Wait, another formula I found online: The 90° pulse duration τ is given by τ = (π/2) / (2π f) ) = π/(4π f) ) = 1/(4f). Wait, that would mean τ = 1/(4f), so f = 1/(4τ). For τ = 1 μs, f = 1/(4 * 1e-6) = 250,000 Hz, which is 0.25 MHz. But that's way below the 13C resonance frequency, which is about 12 MHz. So that can't be right.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that the B1 field strength is given by B1 = (ω * τ) / (2π). Since ω = 2π f, substituting that in:

B1 = (2π f * τ) / (2π) ) = f * τ.

So B1 = f * τ.

Wait, that can't be right because the units don't make sense. f is in Hz (1/s), τ in seconds, so f*τ is dimensionless. That's not possible for B1, which is in Tesla. So, I must have made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the formula correctly. The condition for a 90° pulse is that the area under the B1 pulse is π/2. The area is B1 * τ, so B1 * τ = π/2.

But B1 is the amplitude, which is related to the resonance frequency and the pulse. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is B1 = (π/2) / τ. So, B1 = (π/2) / τ.

With τ = 1e-6 s,

B1 = (π/2) / 1e-6 ≈ 1.5708e6 Tesla. That's way too high, so I must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formula. Let me check online. Oh wait, I can't do that. Hmm.

Another thought: The Larmor frequency ω is 2π f, and the 90° pulse condition is τ = π/(2ω). So, τ = π/(2 * 2π f) ) = 1/(4f). So, f = 1/(4τ).

With τ = 1e-6 s,

f = 1/(4 * 1e-6) = 250,000 Hz, which is 0.25 MHz. But that's way lower than the resonance frequency of 13C, which is about 12 MHz. So that can't be right, which suggests that I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct condition is that the product of the Larmor frequency (in Hz) and the pulse duration (in seconds) is 0.5. So, f * τ = 0.5 → τ = 0.5/f.

So, for a 13C resonance frequency of 12 MHz,

τ = 0.5 / 12e6 ≈ 4.1667e-8 seconds, which is 41.67 nanoseconds. But the question says the pulse duration is 1 μs, which is 1000 times longer. So, that suggests that the B1 field must be higher to compensate.

Wait, so if the correct τ for 12 MHz is 4.1667e-8 s, but the given τ is 1e-6 s (which is 1e-6 / 4.1667e-8 ≈ 24 times longer), then the B1 must be adjusted accordingly.

Wait, perhaps the B1 is proportional to 1/f * τ. Because, to achieve the same rotation angle (90°), if τ is longer, B1 must be lower, but I'm not sure.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the formula is B1 = (π/2) / (τ * f). But I'm not sure.

This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should try a different approach.

I recall that for a 90° pulse, the strength B1 can be calculated using the formula B1 (mT) ≈ 2.35 * f (MHz) * τ (μs). Wait, does that make sense? Let me check the units. f is in MHz (1e6 Hz), τ in μs (1e-6 s). So, 2.35 * f * τ would be 2.35 * 1e6 * 1e-6 = 2.35. So B1 would be 2.35 mT. But looking at the options, option E is 2.15 mT, which is close. But I'm not sure if this formula is correct.

Wait, where did I get this formula from? I'm not sure, but I think I've heard something like that before. Let me see: 2.35 * f (MHz) * τ (μs) gives B1 in mT. So for f=12 MHz and τ=1 μs, B1 ≈ 2.35 * 12 * 1 = 28.2 mT. That's close to option B:25.7 mT and option I:20.2 mT, but not exact.

Wait, perhaps the formula is B1 (mT) ≈ (2.35) * (f (MHz) * τ (μs)). So for 12 MHz and 1 μs, 12 *1=12, 2.35 *12=28.2 mT. But none of the options is 28 mT. The closest is option B:25.7 mT.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is B1 = (f (MHz) * τ (μs)) * 2.35. So, again, 12 *1 *2.35=28.2 mT. Not matching any option.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Another approach: B1 (mT) = ( (2π * f (Hz)) * τ (s) ) / (2π) ) * (1 Tesla = 1000 mT). So,

B1 = (2π f τ) / (2π) ) * 1e-3 = f τ * 1e-3 Tesla = f τ mT.

So, f = 12e6 Hz, τ=1e-6 s.

B1 = 12e6 * 1e-6 = 12 mT.

Ah, that makes sense. So B1 is 12 mT. Looking at the options, option H is 12.5 mT, which is the closest. So the answer should be H:12.5 mT.
</think>

The strength \( B_1 \) of a 90° pulse in a 13C NMR experiment can be calculated using the relationship \( B_1 = f \cdot \tau \), where \( f \) is the resonance frequency in Hz and \( \tau \) is the pulse duration in seconds. For 13C at 3 Tesla, the resonance frequency is approximately 12 MHz (\( f = 12 \times 10^6 \, \text{Hz} \)), and the pulse duration is given as \( \tau = 1 \, \mu s = 1 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{s} \). Substituting these values:

\[
B_1 = (12 \times 10^6) \cdot (1 \times 10^{-6}) = 12 \, \text{mT}.
\]

Among the provided options, the closest value to the calculated \( B_1 \) is **12.5 mT**, corresponding to option H.

Answer: H
