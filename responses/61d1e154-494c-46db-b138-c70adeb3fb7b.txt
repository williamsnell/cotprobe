Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about a completely submerged object and what it always displaces. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that when an object is submerged in a fluid, it displaces some fluid. But wait, what exactly does that mean? Oh right, displacement in physics refers to the fluid that is moved out of the way by the object. The key here is that the object is completely submerged, so it's entirely under the surface of the fluid.

I think Archimedes' principle is relevant here. From what I recall, Archimedes figured out that the buoyant force on an object is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. So the object displaces a volume of fluid equal to its own volume. Because it's submerged, the entire volume of the object is submerged, so the displaced fluid's volume should match that.

Wait, let me think again. The question is asking what the object displaces. So if the object is submerged, it displaces fluid equal to its own volume. So the displaced fluid's volume is the same as the object's volume. So looking at the options, option J is "volume of fluid." That seems to fit.

Let me check the other options to make sure I'm not missing anything. Option D says "weight of fluid." That's related because the buoyant force is the weight of the displaced fluid, but the question is about what is displaced, not the force. So the object displaces volume, not the weight directly. So D is about the weight, which is a result of the displacement, but not the displacement itself.

Option I is "mass of fluid." Well, the mass would depend on the density and volume, but the question is about what's displaced. So the volume is the primary factor here, not the mass. Unless the question is phrased differently, but I think it's about the volume.

Options A through H don't seem right. Pressure, surface area, density, depth, temperature, viscosityâ€”those don't directly relate to what's displaced. The only thing that matters is the volume of the fluid that's moved out of the way, which is the object's volume.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be J: volume of fluid.

The correct answer is determined by understanding that a completely submerged object displaces a volume of fluid equal to its own volume. This is based on Archimedes' principle, which states that the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the displaced fluid. The question specifically asks what is displaced, which is the fluid's volume, not its weight or mass. Therefore, the correct option is J.

Answer: J
