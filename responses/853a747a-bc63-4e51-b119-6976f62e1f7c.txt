Okay, so I need to figure out how much Paul Murphy should invest now to have $10,000 in 10 years with an annual compound interest rate of 4%. Hmm, I remember there's a formula for compound interest, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think.

The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), right? Where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest. 
- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- t is the time the money is invested for in years.

In this case, the interest is compounded annually, so n would be 1. The rate is 4%, so r is 0.04. The time is 10 years, t is 10. The future value A needs to be $10,000. We need to find P, the present value.

So plugging the numbers into the formula: A = P*(1 + 0.04)^10. We need to solve for P, so P = A / (1.04)^10.

Let me calculate (1.04)^10 first. I'll need to compute that. Alternatively, I can use natural logarithms or a calculator, but maybe I should recall the value. Wait, I think (1.04)^10 is approximately 1.480244285.

So P = 10,000 / 1.480244285. Let me compute that division. 10,000 divided by 1.480244 is roughly... let me do it step by step.

Hmm, 10,000 divided by 1.48. Well, 1.48 times 6 is about 8.88, which is too low. Let's think, 1.48 * 6,000 = 8,880. So 10,000 - 8,880 is 1,120 remaining. 1.48 * 700 is 1,036. So 6,700 would give 1.48 *6,700 = 9,916. So 6,700 gives 9,916. That's still 84 left. 1.48 * 55 is 81.4, so total would be 6,755. So approximately 6,755? Wait, but let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 1.48 * 6,756 = let's compute 6,756 * 1.48.

6,756 * 1 = 6,756. 

6,756 * 0.48 = let's calculate 6,756 * 0.4 is 2,702.4 and 6,756 * 0.08 is 540.48. So total 0.48 part is 2,702.4 + 540.48 = 3,242.88.

So 6,756 + 3,242.88 = 9,998.88. But our desired A is 10,000. So 6,756 gives 9,998.88, which is close to 10,000. So we need to find a little more than 6,756.

The difference is 10,000 - 9,998.88 = 1.12. How much more do we need to add to 6,756?

Since each 1 unit of P adds 1.48 to A, so each 1.12 would add 1.12/1.48 ≈ 0.7627. So P ≈ 6,756 + 0.7627 ≈ 6,756.76. So approximately $6,756.76.

Looking at the options, option F is $6,756.00. So that's the closest. But wait, maybe I should double-check the exact calculation to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a more precise calculation. Let me compute (1.04)^10 accurately.

1.04^10 can be calculated as:

1.04^1 = 1.04

1.04^2 = 1.0816

1.04^3 = 1.04 * 1.0816 = approximately 1.124864

1.04^4 ≈ 1.124864 * 1.04 ≈ 1.16985856

1.04^5 ≈ 1.16985856 * 1.04 ≈ 1.2166529

1.04^6 ≈ 1.2166529 * 1.04 ≈ 1.2653195

1.04^7 ≈ 1.2653195 * 1.04 ≈ 1.3159233

1.04^8 ≈ 1.3159233 * 1.04 ≈ 1.3685693

1.04^9 ≈ 1.3685693 * 1.04 ≈ 1.423356

1.04^10 ≈ 1.423356 * 1.04 ≈ 1.48024424.

So (1.04)^10 ≈ 1.48024424.

Therefore, P = 10,000 / 1.48024424 ≈ 6,756.72.

So looking at the options, F is $6,756.00. But wait, the exact amount is approximately $6,756.72, so the closest option is $6,756.00. So the answer should be F.

To determine how much Paul Murphy should invest now to have $10,000 in 10 years with an annual compound interest rate of 4%, we use the compound interest formula:

\[ A = P(1 + r/n)^{nt} \]

Where:
- \( A = 10,000 \) (the amount of money accumulated after 10 years),
- \( r = 0.04 \) (annual interest rate),
- \( n = 1 \) (compounded annually),
- \( t = 10 \) (number of years).

Rearranging for \( P \):

\[ P = \frac{A}{(1 + r/n)^{nt}} = \frac{10,000}{(1.04)^{10}} \]

Calculating \( (1.04)^{10} \) gives approximately 1.48024424. Thus:

\[ P = \frac{10,000}{1.48024424} \approx 6,756.72 \]

The closest option is F: $6,756.00.
