Okay, so I've got this question about antennas and their maximum effective aperture. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my antenna theory, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says the directivity of the antenna is 50, and it operates at a wavelength of 4 meters. I need to find the maximum effective aperture. The options are from A to J, each giving a different value in square meters.

First, I remember that directivity (D) is a measure of how focused an antenna's radiation is. It's the ratio of the maximum radiation intensity to the average radiation intensity over all directions. Directivity is related to the effective aperture (Aeff) of the antenna.

I think the formula that connects directivity with effective aperture is something like Aeff = λ² * D / (4π). Wait, let me make sure I get the formula right. Oh right, the effective aperture is given by the product of the directivity (D) and the wavelength squared (λ²), divided by (4 times pi). So Aeff = (λ² * D) / (4π).

Let me plug in the numbers. The wavelength λ is 4 meters. So λ squared is 4^2 = 16 m². The directivity D is 50. So λ² times D is 16 * 50 = 800. Then I divide that by 4π. Pi is approximately 3.1416, so 4π is about 12.566.

So 800 divided by 12.566. Let me calculate that. 800 ÷ 12.566. Hmm, 12.566 times 63 is about 795, because 12.566 * 60 = 753.96, and 12.566 * 3 = 37.7, so total around 791.66. That's close to 800. So 63.6? Wait, 63.6 times 12.566 would be around 800.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 800 divided by 12.566. Let me do 800 ÷ 12.566. Let's see, 12.566 * 63.6 is about 63.6 * 12.566. Let me compute that: 60 *12.566=753.96, 3.6*12.566≈45.2376. Adding them gives 753.96 +45.2376≈799.1976, which is very close to 800. So 63.6 is approximately the result.

So Aeff ≈ 63.6 m². Looking at the options, option H is 63.6 m². So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I use the correct formula? Let me double-check. The formula for effective aperture is indeed Aeff = (λ² * D) / (4π). I think that's correct. Directivity is unitless, wavelength is in meters, so the units would be m², which matches the options.

Alternatively, sometimes I've seen the formula written as Aeff = (λ² D) / (4π). Yeah, that's the same thing. So I think I did it right. So the answer should be H.

The maximum effective aperture is calculated using the formula \( A_{\text{eff}} = \frac{\lambda^2 D}{4\pi} \), where \( \lambda = 4 \, \text{m} \) and \( D = 50 \). Plugging in the values, \( \lambda^2 = 16 \, \text{m}^2 \), \( \lambda^2 D = 800 \), and dividing by \( 4\pi \) (approximately 12.566) gives \( A_{\text{eff}} \approx 63.6 \, \text{m}^2 \).

Answer: H
