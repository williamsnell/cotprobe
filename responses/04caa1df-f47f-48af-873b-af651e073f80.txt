Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Clearly, no longer can a dictator count on East–West confrontation to stymie concerted United Nations action against aggression. A new partnership of nations has begun. And we stand today at a unique and extraordinary moment. The crisis in the Persian Gulf, as grave as it is, also offers a rare opportunity to move toward an historic period of cooperation. Out of these troubled times, our fifth objective—a new world order—can emerge; a new era, freer from the threat of terror, stronger in the pursuit of justice, and more secure in the quest for peace. An era in which the nations of the world, east and west, north and south, can prosper and live in harmony.
—President George Herbert Walker Bush, Speech to a Joint Session of Congress, September 11, 1990

Okay, so I have this question about President George H.W. Bush's speech where he talked about a "new world order." The question is asking which historical policy or doctrine it most resembles from the given options. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what Bush meant by the "new world order." From the speech, he mentions moving away from East-West confrontations and towards a time of cooperation. He talks about a world freer from terror, stronger in justice, and more secure in peace. He also refers to a partnership of nations, which suggests a collective effort to maintain stability and prevent aggression.

Looking at the options, I need to match this vision to one of the policies listed. Let me go through each option one by one.

A: Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points. Wilson's plan was after World War I, focusing on open diplomacy, self-determination, and a league of nations. It was a vision for peace after a war, but it's more about the structure of the post-war world rather than a strategy against a specific threat. Bush's speech is about a new era of cooperation, but Wilson's points were about ending war and creating a league, so maybe a bit similar but not directly.

B: The Truman Doctrine. This was about containing communism, offering support to countries resisting Soviet expansion. It's more about a policy of containment and support, not a new world order in terms of cooperation across the globe.

C: The Monroe Doctrine. This was the US policy of not intervening in European affairs and avoiding colonization in the Americas. It's more about isolationism and protecting the Western Hemisphere, which doesn't seem to align with Bush's vision of global cooperation.

D: Theodore Roosevelt's "Big Stick." This was about using military power to influence other countries, a more assertive foreign policy. Doesn't seem to match Bush's emphasis on cooperation and partnership.

E: The Marshall Plan. This was a post-WWII program to rebuild Europe and prevent communism through economic aid. It was a significant policy but focused on rebuilding and containment, not a new world order in terms of global cooperation.

F: The Roosevelt Corollary. An extension of the Monroe Doctrine, it stated that the US would police the Western Hemisphere. Again, more about regional influence rather than global cooperation.

G: The Domino Theory. The idea that if one country falls to communism, others will follow like dominos. This was part of containment policy, not a vision for a new order.

H: Containment policy toward the Soviet Union. This was the main US foreign policy after WWII, aiming to stop the spread of communism. While it influenced many policies, Bush's new world order seems broader, focusing on cooperation beyond just containment.

I: Richard Nixon's "Peace with Honor." This refers to the policy in Vietnam, focusing on withdrawing US forces while maintaining South Vietnam's integrity. It's more about ending a specific conflict rather than a global vision.

Now, considering all this, Bush's speech emphasizes a shift away from the Cold War confrontation and towards a cooperative global order. The "new world order" he talks about seems to be a vision of a more harmonious, less confrontation-based international system, where nations work together to prevent aggression and promote peace and justice.

Looking at the options, the closest match would be the idea of a global partnership and cooperation. The Truman Doctrine was about containment, not cooperation. The Marshall Plan was about rebuilding and economic aid, but again, not a new world order in the sense Bush is talking about.

Wait, but the question is about which policy it most directly resembles. The Truman Doctrine was about containment, but the containment policy (option H) is broader and was the main strategy during the Cold War. However, Bush is talking about moving beyond that. So maybe H isn't the best fit.

Alternatively, looking back, the idea of a partnership and cooperation might align more with the Marshall Plan's spirit of international collaboration, but the Marshall Plan was about economic recovery, not a new world order.

Wait, perhaps the answer is H: containment policy. Because containment was the main approach towards the Soviet Union, and Bush's speech was during the Persian Gulf crisis, which was part of the larger Cold War context. He's suggesting that the end of the East-West confrontation allows for a new era, which might be a move beyond containment. But containment was about stopping the spread, so maybe not directly.

Alternatively, perhaps the "new world order" is more akin to the Monroe Doctrine in that it's a US vision for the world, but I don't think that's it either.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key here is that the "new world order" is about a shift towards cooperation and away from the old confrontations. So looking at the options, the closest would be the Truman Doctrine, which was a policy aimed at stopping communism, hence promoting a certain order, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the containment policy (H) is about preventing the spread of an ideology, which is similar to Bush's vision of preventing aggression globally.

But wait, in the speech, Bush talks about a new partnership and moving beyond the East-West divide. So perhaps it's more about the end of the Cold War and the beginning of a new era, which might not directly align with any of the options but perhaps the closest is the containment policy because it's about a strategy to manage global challenges.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is A: Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points, which was a vision for a new world order after WWI, though that's a stretch.

Wait, but the question is about which policy it most directly resembles. Another angle: the "new world order" was about a cooperative international system, which could be seen as a continuation of the containment policy but in a new form, or perhaps as a move beyond it towards multilateralism.

But considering the options, the containment policy (H) is about a strategy to limit the influence of an adversary, which in the 90s was the Soviet Union. However, after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, containment was becoming less relevant, and the new world order was about a different approach.

Wait, but the speech was in 1990, just before the Soviet Union collapsed. So perhaps the new world order was a vision of a post-Cold War order, which would be a shift from containment.

Alternatively, looking at the options, the one that's about a new global order is A: Wilson's Fourteen Points, which was a vision for a new world order after WWI. So maybe that's the closest.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the answer might be H, containment, because it's about managing global challenges, but perhaps the question is looking for something else.

Wait, another thought: the new world order is about a cooperative and less confrontational approach, which is similar to the idea of the Truman Doctrine but more about cooperation. Alternatively, perhaps it's more like the Marshall Plan's emphasis on rebuilding and international cooperation, but the Marshall Plan was about economic recovery.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

The key elements of Bush's speech: end of East-West confrontation, new partnership, cooperation, a period of cooperation leading to a new world order, focusing on peace, justice, and prosperity.

Looking at the options, the one that aimed to create a new international order through cooperation and assistance was the Marshall Plan, but that's about economic aid. Alternatively, the Truman Doctrine was about providing support to anti-communist states, which is more about containment.

Perhaps the answer is H: containment policy toward the Soviet Union, as it was the main policy during the Cold War, and Bush is talking about moving beyond it to a new era. But containment was about stopping the spread, while the new world order is about a new cooperative structure.

Wait, but containment was the policy, and the new world order is a vision that could be seen as a form of containment but in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is I: Nixon's "Peace with Honor," but that's about Vietnam, not a global vision.

Wait, another angle: the "new world order" was a vision that included a partnership of nations, implying a multilateral approach. The containment policy was more unilateral or bilateral in many cases. So perhaps it's not containment.

Alternatively, the answer could be A: Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points, as both were visions for a new world order, but Wilson's was after WWI and Bush's after the Cold War. So maybe that's the closest.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H, containment, because it's about policy towards adversaries, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E: The Marshall Plan, because it was about rebuilding and cooperation, but the question is about the new world order as a policy, not an economic plan.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H: containment policy, as it's about managing global challenges, but again, I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about which of these policies was a vision for a new international order. The Fourteen Points were a vision for a new world order, so that could be the answer.

Alternatively, the containment policy was a strategy, not a vision.

So, given that, the answer might be A: Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H: containment policy, as it's a policy aimed at a specific global strategy, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the question says "most directly resembles." So the "new world order" is a vision, similar to Wilson's Fourteen Points, which was a vision for a new world order after WWI. So perhaps A is the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H, containment, because it's about managing global threats, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the containment policy was implemented through various means, including the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan, but the policy itself is containment. So perhaps the answer is H.

But I'm still torn between A and H.

Wait, in the speech, Bush talks about a new partnership and moving away from East-West confrontation, which suggests a shift beyond containment. So perhaps the answer is not H, but something else.

Alternatively, considering that the containment policy was about stopping the spread, and the new world order is about a new structure, perhaps the answer is A.

But I'm not entirely confident. I think I'll go with A: Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points, as both were visions for a new world order, even if they were in different contexts.

The question asks which historical policy or doctrine most closely resembles President George H.W. Bush's vision of a "new world order" as described in his 1990 speech. Bush's speech emphasizes moving beyond the East-West confrontation of the Cold War and toward a cooperative global order focused on peace, justice, and prosperity. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points**  
  Wilson's vision was for a new world order after World War I, focusing on open diplomacy and self-determination. While the contexts differ, both Wilson's and Bush's speeches present a vision for a new international order, making this a strong contender.

- **B: The Truman Doctrine**  
  This was a containment policy aimed at stopping the spread of communism. While it influenced global strategy, it was more about opposing adversaries rather than fostering global cooperation, which is central to Bush's vision.

- **C: The Monroe Doctrine**  
  Focused on avoiding European intervention in the Americas, it doesn't align with Bush's global vision.

- **D: Theodore Roosevelt's "Big Stick"**  
  Emphasized military influence, which contrasts with Bush's emphasis on partnership and cooperation.

- **E: The Marshall Plan**  
  Focused on economic recovery and containment, not a new global order.

- **F: The Roosevelt Corollary**  
  Extended the Monroe Doctrine, focusing on regional influence, not global cooperation.

- **G: The Domino Theory**  
  A specific idea about the spread of communism, not a comprehensive vision.

- **H: Containment policy toward the Soviet Union**  
  While containment was a key Cold War strategy, Bush's speech suggests moving beyond it to a new era of cooperation, making this less directly aligned.

- **I: Richard Nixon's "Peace with Honor"**  
  Focused on Vietnam, not a global vision.

Considering the emphasis on cooperation and a new global order, **Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points** most closely resemble Bush's vision, as both presented a blueprint for a new international structure. 

Answer: A
