Okay, so I've got this equation to solve: 6.73 equals z divided by 7.74. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you have a variable in the numerator like this, you can solve for it by isolating z. 

So the equation is 6.73 = z / 7.74. To get z by itself, I need to do the opposite of division, which is multiplication. That means I should multiply both sides of the equation by 7.74. 

Let me write that out: 6.73 multiplied by 7.74. Wait, how do I calculate that? I think I'll need to do some decimal multiplication. Let me break it down. 

First, I can ignore the decimals and multiply 673 by 774. But that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can do it step by step. 

Alternatively, I can think of 6.73 as 6 and 0.73, and 7.74 as 7 and 0.74. But that might not help much. Maybe it's easier to just multiply the two numbers directly.

Let me try multiplying 6.73 by 7.74. 

I'll set it up like a multiplication problem:

   6.73
× 7.74
--------

I can multiply 6.73 by each digit of 7.74, starting from the right. 

Wait, maybe a better way is to compute 6.73 * 7.74. Let me do this step by step.

First, 6.73 * 7 = 47.11
Then, 6.73 * 0.74. Let's compute that. 6.73 * 0.7 is 4.711, and 6.73 * 0.04 is 0.2692. Adding those together gives 4.711 + 0.2692 = 4.9802.

Now, adding the two parts together: 47.11 + 4.9802 = 52.0902.

Wait, that can't be right. Because 6.73 times 7.74. Let me check that again.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the second part. When I multiplied 6.73 by 0.74, I should have considered it as 6.73 * (0.7 + 0.04). 

Wait, 6.73 * 0.7 is indeed 4.711, and 6.73 * 0.04 is 0.2692. Adding those gives 4.711 + 0.2692 = 4.9802. Then adding that to 47.11 gives 52.0902.

Wait, but 6.73 ×7.74 = 52.0902? Let me check using another method. Maybe I can use a calculator approach, but since I can't, I'll try another way.

Alternatively, I can think of 6.73 as approximately 6.7 and 7.74 as approximately 7.7. 6.7 * 7.7 is about 51.59, which is close to 52.09. So that seems reasonable.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G is 52.0902, which matches my calculation. So z should be 52.0902. Let me check the options:

A: 53.0902
B: −1.0102
C: 0.0112
D: 7.74
E: 1.0112
F: 52.1902
G: 52.0902
H: -52.0902
I: 50.0902
J: 51.5902

So G is 52.0902, which matches my calculation. Therefore, the correct answer should be G.

The equation is 6.73 = z / 7.74. To solve for z, multiply both sides by 7.74: z = 6.73 × 7.74. Calculating this gives z = 52.0902, which corresponds to option G.

Answer: G
