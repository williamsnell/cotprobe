Okay, so I have this question about the asteroid Pallas. The question is asking me to find the semi-major axis of its orbit. The given information includes the orbital period, which is 4.62 years, and the orbital eccentricity, which is 0.233. The options are labeled A through J, each with a number, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that in orbital mechanics, the semi-major axis is a key parameter that relates to the size of the orbit. I think Kepler's third law is involved here because it connects the orbital period and the semi-major axis. But wait, Kepler's law in its original form is for planets orbiting the Sun, right? So for Pallas, which is an asteroid, it should still apply, I guess, since it's orbiting the Sun as well.

Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) of the orbit. The exact formula is P² = (4π²/GM) * a³, where G is the gravitational constant and M is the mass of the Sun. But when we use astronomical units and years, the formula simplifies because the constants cancel out. I think in those units, P² = a³. So, if the period is in years and the semi-major axis is in astronomical units (AU), that formula holds.

Wait, but in this problem, the semi-major axis is requested in meters, specifically in units of 10^11 meters. So I'll need to convert the result from AU to meters.

First, let's find the semi-major axis in AU using Kepler's third law. The period P is 4.62 years. So, according to P² = a³:

a³ = P²
a³ = (4.62)²
a³ = 21.3444

Wait, calculating 4.62 squared: 4.62 * 4.62. Let me compute that properly. 4 times 4 is 16, 0.62 times 4 is 2.48, 4 times 0.62 is another 2.48, and 0.62 squared is about 0.3844. So adding up: 16 + 2.48 + 2.48 + 0.3844. Wait no, that's not the right way. Alternatively, 4.62 * 4.62. Let me compute it step by step.

4.62 * 4.62:

First, 4 * 4 = 16.

4 * 0.62 = 2.48.

0.62 * 4 = 2.48.

0.62 * 0.62 = 0.3844.

Wait, no, that's not correct for multiplying two two-digit numbers. Wait, perhaps it's better to do it as (4 + 0.62) * (4 + 0.62) = 4² + 2*4*0.62 + 0.62².

So, 16 + 2*(4*0.62) + 0.3844.

4*0.62 is 2.48, multiplied by 2 gives 4.96.

So 16 + 4.96 = 20.96, plus 0.3844 is 21.3444. So P squared is 21.3444, so a cubed is 21.3444. Therefore, a is the cube root of 21.3444.

Now, I need to find the cube root of 21.3444. Let me think. The cube of 2 is 8, 3 is 27, so it's between 2 and 3. Let me try 2.7: 2.7^3 = 19.683. 2.8^3: 2.8 * 2.8 =7.84, then 7.84 *2.8. Let's calculate 7 * 2.8 = 19.6, 0.84*2.8=2.352, so total 21.952. Hmm, 2.8^3 is 21.952, which is a bit higher than 21.3444.

So the cube root is between 2.7 and 2.8. Let me try 2.75^3. 2.75 * 2.75 is 7.5625. Then 7.5625 * 2.75. Let's compute that.

7 * 2.75 = 19.25.

0.5625 * 2.75: 0.5 *2.75=1.375, 0.0625*2.75=0.171875. So total 1.375 +0.171875=1.546875.

Adding to 19.25: 19.25 + 1.546875 = 20.796875.

So 2.75^3 is about 20.796875, which is less than 21.3444. The difference is 21.3444 - 20.796875 = 0.547525.

So between 2.75 and 2.8. Let's see how much more. The difference between 2.8^3 and 2.75^3 is 21.952 - 20.796875 = 1.155125. We need an additional 0.547525 from 2.75, so the fraction is 0.547525 / 1.155125 ≈ 0.474. So approximately 2.75 + (0.474*(0.05))? Wait, no, because each 0.05 step is 0.05 in x. Wait, no, 2.75 to 2.8 is 0.05 increase. So 0.474 of that 0.05 is about 0.0237. So a ≈ 2.75 + 0.0237 = 2.7737 AU.

Wait, but that's an approximation. Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator would be more accurate, but since I'm doing this manually, maybe I can use linear approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think that the cube root of 21.3 is around 2.77 or so. Let me check 2.77^3: 2.77 *2.77 = 7.6729. Then 7.6729 *2.77. Let's compute 7 *2.77=19.39, 0.6729*2.77≈1.860. So total approx 19.39 + 1.860 ≈21.25. Close to 21.3444. So perhaps a is around 2.775 AU.

Wait, 2.775^3: Let me compute 2.775 *2.775 first. 2.775 *2.775: Let's see, (2.7 + 0.075)^2. Which is 2.7² + 2*2.7*0.075 + 0.075².

2.7² =7.29.

2*2.7*0.075= 5.4 *0.075 =0.405.

0.075²=0.005625.

So total is 7.29 + 0.405 =7.695 + 0.005625=7.700625.

Now, multiply by 2.775 again: 7.700625 * 2.775.

Let me break it down:

7 *2.775 = 19.425.

0.700625 *2.775. Let's compute 0.7 *2.775=1.9425.

0.000625 *2.775=0.001734375.

So adding up: 19.425 +1.9425=21.3675 +0.001734375≈21.3692. That's a bit higher than 21.3444. So 2.775^3≈21.3692. So 21.3444 is a bit less than that. So perhaps a is approximately 2.773 AU.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have gotten ahead of myself. Because Kepler's third law in the form P² = a³ uses a in AU and P in years. So I have a^3 = P² = (4.62)^2 ≈21.3444, so a is cube root of 21.3444 ≈2.773 AU.

So the semi-major axis is approximately 2.773 AU. But wait, the question provides the eccentricity as 0.233. Does that affect the semi-major axis? Hmm, no, because the semi-major axis is a parameter of the orbit regardless of the eccentricity. Eccentricity affects the shape but not the size of the orbit in terms of the semi-major axis. So the semi-major axis I calculated should be correct regardless of the eccentricity.

Wait, but wait a second. I just realized that Kepler's third law when applied in SI units (meters and seconds) would require a different approach. Oh, but since the question wants the semi-major axis in 10^11 meters, maybe I should use the version of Kepler's law that's in terms of meters and seconds.

Wait, I'm a bit confused now. Let me clarify: using Kepler's third law in different units.

The standard form when using years, AU, and solar masses is P² = a³. But if I want to use SI units, I need to express it in terms of meters and seconds.

The formula in SI units is:

P² = (4π²/GM) * a³

Where G is the gravitational constant (6.6743 × 10^-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2), and M is the mass of the Sun (1.9885 × 10^30 kg).

So P is given in years, which I need to convert into seconds. So I should convert 4.62 years into seconds.

One year is approximately 365.25 days. So 4.62 years * 365.25 days/year = let's compute that.

4 *365.25 = 1461 days.

0.62 *365.25 ≈ 226.665 days.

So total days ≈1461 + 226.665 ≈1687.665 days.

Each day has 86400 seconds. So 1687.665 days * 86400 s/day = ?

1687.665 * 86400 = let me compute this step by step.

First, 1687 * 86400: 1687 * 86400.

But maybe it's easier to compute 4.62 years in seconds directly.

4.62 years * 365.25 days/year * 86400 s/day.

So 4.62 *365.25 = ?

4 * 365.25 = 1461.

0.62 *365.25 ≈226.665.

So total ≈1461 + 226.665=1687.665 days.

Multiply by 86400 s/day.

1687.665 * 86400 = ?

Hmm, 1687.665 * 86400 = let's compute 1687.665 *8.64e4.

Alternatively, 1687.665 *8.64e4 = 1687.665 *86400.

Let me compute 1687.665 * 86400.

First, 1687 *86400.

But this might take a while. Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 4.62 years in seconds directly.

1 year = approx 3.15576 ×10^7 seconds.

So 4.62 years = 4.62 * 3.15576e7 s ≈ let's compute that.

3.15576e7 *4 = 1.262304e8.

3.15576e7 *0.62 = let's compute 3.15576e7 *0.6 =1.893456e7, and 3.15576e7 *0.02=631152. So total 1.893456e7 +631,152 =1.9565712e7.

So total P in seconds is 1.262304e8 +1.9565712e7 = 1.45796112e8 seconds.

So P = 1.45796112e8 s.

Now, using Kepler's third law:

P² = (4π²/(G*M)) * a³

We can rearrange to solve for a:

a³ = (G*M * P²) / (4π²)

Where G = 6.6743e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²

M = mass of Sun = 1.9885e30 kg

So let's compute numerator and denominator.

First, compute G*M: 6.6743e-11 * 1.9885e30 = let's compute that.

6.6743e-11 * 1.9885e30 = (6.6743 *1.9885) * 1e( -11 +30 ) = (13.27) *1e19 ≈1.327e20.

Wait, more accurately:

6.6743 *1.9885 ≈ let's compute:

6 *1.9885 =11.931.

0.6743 *1.9885 ≈approx 1.341.

So total≈11.931 +1.341=13.272.

So G*M ≈13.272e19 =1.3272e20.

Now, compute P²: (1.45796112e8)^2.

(1.45796112e8)^2 = (1.45796112)^2 * 1e16.

1.45796112^2 ≈ 2.125 (since 1.45^2=2.1025, and 1.46^2=2.1316; so 1.458^2 is about 2.125).

So P² ≈2.125e16 seconds².

Now, numerator: G*M * P² =1.3272e20 *2.125e16 = (1.3272*2.125) *1e36.

1.3272 *2.125 ≈ let's compute:

1.3272 * 2 =2.6544.

1.3272 *0.125=0.1659.

Total ≈2.6544 +0.1659=2.8203.

So numerator ≈2.8203e36.

Denominator: 4π²≈4*(9.8696)≈39.4784.

So a³ = numerator / denominator = 2.8203e36 /39.4784 ≈7.142e34.

So a = cube root of (7.142e34) meters.

Wait, cube root of 7.142e34 m³.

So first, express 7.142e34 as 7.142 x10^34.

The cube root of 10^34 is 10^(34/3) =10^11.333..., since 34/3 ≈11.333. So 10^11.333 is approximately 2.154e11 (since 10^0.333≈2.154).

So cube root of 7.142e34 ≈ cube_root(7.142) * 10^11.333.

Cube root of 7.142: since 1.9^3=6.859, and 2.0^3=8. So 7.142 is between 1.9^3 and 2.0^3.

Compute 1.91^3: 1.91 *1.91 =3.6481, then 3.6481 *1.91 ≈6.968.

1.92^3: 1.92 *1.92=3.6864, *1.92≈7.077. Close to 7.142.

1.92^3≈7.077. The target is 7.142, which is about 0.065 higher.

So let's see how much more beyond 1.92 we need.

Let’s find x such that (1.92 + x)^3 ≈7.142.

The derivative of x³ at x=1.92 is 3*(1.92)^2 =3*(3.6864)=11.0592.

So delta x ≈ (7.142 -7.077)/11.0592 ≈(0.065)/11.0592≈0.005876.

So approximately 1.92 +0.005876≈1.925876.

So cube root of 7.142 ≈1.9259.

So a ≈1.9259 * 2.154e11 m ≈ let's compute that.

1.9259 *2.154 ≈ let me compute:

1 *2.154=2.154.

0.9259 *2.154 ≈0.9*2.154=1.9386, 0.0259*2.154≈0.0557. So total≈1.9386+0.0557=1.9943.

Adding to 2.154: 2.154 +1.9943≈4.1483.

Wait, no, that approach is incorrect. Wait, 1.9259 is multiplied by 2.154.

Wait, perhaps better to compute 1.9259 *2.154:

1.9259 *2 =3.8518.

1.9259 *0.154≈ approx:

1.9259 *0.1=0.19259.

1.9259 *0.05=0.096295.

1.9259 *0.004≈0.0077036.

Adding those: 0.19259 +0.096295=0.288885 +0.0077036≈0.296589.

So total 3.8518 +0.296589≈4.1484.

So a ≈4.1484e11 meters.

Wait, but the options are given in units of 10^11 meters, so 4.1484e11 meters is 4.1484 x10^11 m, so the semi-major axis is approximately 4.15 x10^11 meters, which would correspond to option I (4.15).

Wait, but let me check my calculations again because I think I might have made a mistake. Earlier, when I used the method with AU, I got a semi-major axis of around 2.77 AU, which in meters is 2.77 *1.496e11 m ≈4.14e11 m. So that aligns with the SI calculation.

Wait, but when I computed using the AU method, I had a ≈2.77 AU, which is about 2.77 *1.496e11 m ≈4.14e11 m. So that's consistent with the SI approach.

So the semi-major axis is approximately 4.14e11 meters, which is option I: 4.15.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I is 4.15, which matches our result.

So the correct answer should be option I: 4.15.
</think>

To determine the semi-major axis of asteroid Pallas's orbit, we use Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period \( P \) (in years) and the semi-major axis \( a \) (in AU) as \( P^2 = a^3 \). Given \( P = 4.62 \) years, we calculate:

\[
a^3 = P^2 = (4.62)^2 = 21.3444
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt[3]{21.3444} \approx 2.77 \, \text{AU}
\]

To convert this to meters, we use \( 1 \, \text{AU} = 1.496 \times 10^{11} \, \text{m} \):

\[
a \approx 2.77 \times 1.496 \times 10^{11} \, \text{m} \approx 4.14 \times 10^{11} \, \text{m}
\]

This matches option I: 4.15.

Answer: I
