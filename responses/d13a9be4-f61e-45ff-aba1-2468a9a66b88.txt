Okay, so I'm trying to solve this accounting question about Elan Co.'s vacation liability and expense. Let me read it carefully and think through it step by step.

Elan Co. has two employees. Each gets two weeks of paid vacation each year, and the rights accumulate. So, if an employee doesn't use their vacation, it carries over to the next year.

The first employee earns $600 per week. He took a two-week vacation during the year. The second employee makes $800 per week and didn't take any vacation. The question is about what Elan should report as vacation liability and expense at the end of the year.

Hmm, I remember that vacation liability is the amount the company owes to employees for unused vacation time. And the expense is the cost recognized for the vacation taken or accrued.

Each employee gets two weeks a year. So, for each employee, the total vacation they're entitled to is 2 weeks.

Let's break down each employee:

1. First employee: $600/week, took two weeks off. So, the company paid them for those two weeks. That would be an expense of 2 * 600 = $1200. Since they used all their vacation, there's no liability for this employee at the end of the year.

2. Second employee: $800/week, took no vacation. So, they have two weeks accrued. Since vacation rights accumulate, this unused time is a liability for the company. The liability would be 2 * 800 = $1600. The expense for this employee would be zero because they didn't take any vacation, so no expense is recognized yet.

Wait, but wait. I think the expense is recognized when the vacation is taken. So, for the first employee, the expense is $1200 (2 weeks * $600). For the second, since they didn't take any, the expense is zero. So total expense is $1200.

But what about the liability? The liability is the amount owed for unused vacation. So the second employee has two weeks, so $1600. The first used all their time, so no liability from them. So total liability is $1600.

Wait, but wait another thing. Does the company account for the vacation expense as it's earned or when it's taken? I think it's when it's earned. So, each week the employee works, the company accrues a liability for the vacation they're earning. So for each employee, each week they work, the company sets aside that week's salary as part of the vacation liability.

Wait, that might complicate things. Let me think again.

The standard approach is that as employees work, they earn their vacation. So each week, the company recognizes an expense for the vacation they're earning and increases the liability. Then, when they take the vacation, the liability is reduced and paid out.

So for each employee:

First employee: $600/week, worked for 52 weeks. Wait, no, the question says each gets two weeks of paid vacation each year. So perhaps the company has a policy that employees earn their vacation over the year. So each employee works, say, 52 weeks, and each week they earn 2/52 weeks of vacation. Or maybe the two weeks are granted at the beginning, and they can take it anytime.

Wait, the question says "vacation rights accumulate," which suggests that the vacation time is earned over time, perhaps, but I'm not entirely sure. But given that each gets two weeks, regardless of when they take it, perhaps the vacation is a predetermined amount each year.

Wait, perhaps the company grants each employee two weeks of paid vacation each year. So, the total liability is for the vacation they have not yet taken. So for each employee, the total vacation they can take is two weeks, and if they don't take it, the company must account for it as a liability.

So, the first employee took two weeks, so they've used all their vacation. No liability. The second employee didn't take any, so their two weeks are still available, so the liability is for two weeks at $800, which is $1600.

Now, the expense. The expense is the amount paid for the vacation taken. So the first employee took two weeks, so $600 * 2 = $1200 expense. The second took none, so no expense. So total expense is $1200.

Wait, but wait, maybe the expense is based on the amount earned, not just when taken. Because in accounting, sometimes expenses are accrued as they're earned, not when paid. So, the company may recognize the expense for the vacation as it's earned by the employees, regardless of when it's taken.

So, for each employee, the total vacation they get is two weeks. So the total expense for the year would be for both employees, regardless of whether they took the vacation or not. So:

First employee: 2 weeks * $600 = $1200 expense.

Second employee: 2 weeks * $800 = $1600 expense.

Total expense would be $1200 + $1600 = $2800.

But wait, that can't be right because the first employee took the vacation, so the expense would be based on what was taken, not the total earned. Or is it based on what was earned, regardless of usage?

Wait, no. I think the vacation expense is recognized when the vacation is taken. So, if an employee takes two weeks, that's when the expense is recorded, even if the vacation was earned over the year. So in that case, only the first employee incurs an expense of $1200, and the second, having not taken any, doesn't have an expense.

But I'm getting confused. Let me think of it another way. When an employee works, they earn their right to vacation. So each week they work, the company has an accrued liability for the vacation they're earning. So for each employee, their total vacation liability at year-end is the amount they've earned but not yet taken.

So for both employees, the vacation liability would be based on the time they've worked and the vacation they've earned.

Wait, but the question says each employee receives two weeks of paid vacation each year. So perhaps the company grants two weeks regardless of performance, so each employee is entitled to two weeks per year, and the vacation is considered an expense when it's taken.

But the vacation rights accumulate, so if they don't take it this year, it carries over to the next. So, the liability is for the unused portion.

So, for the first employee, they took two weeks, so they used all their vacation. So no liability from them. The second employee didn't take any, so they have two weeks' worth of vacation, which is 2 * $800 = $1600 liability.

As for the expense, the expense is the amount paid for the vacation taken. So the first employee's two weeks cost the company $1200, so that's the expense. The second didn't take any, so no expense. So total expense is $1200, liability is $1600.

Wait, but I'm not considering whether the company recognizes the expense as it's earned or when it's taken. Let me think again. If the company recognizes the expense when the vacation is taken, then yes, only the first employee's $1200 is the expense. But if the company recognizes the expense when the vacation is earned, then both employees would have an expense, regardless of whether they took the vacation or not.

Wait, I think the correct approach is that the expense is recognized when the vacation is taken. So, for the first employee, $1200 expense. The second didn't take any, so no expense. So the total expense is $1200.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another way: the company's vacation expense is the amount paid out for vacation during the year. So if an employee took two weeks, that's $1200. The other didn't take any, so total expense is $1200.

The liability is for the unused vacation. So the second employee has two weeks unused, which is 2 * $800 = $1600.

So the company reports a liability of $1600 and an expense of $1200.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option D: Liability $1200, expense $1600. No, that's not matching.

Option G: Liability $1600, expense $1200. Yes, that's what I think.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A: $800 $1200

B: $2400 $1600

C: $1600 $2800

D: $1200 $1600

E: $0 $1200

F: $0 $2800

G: $1600 $1200

H: $2800 $1600

I: $1600 $0

J: $2800 $0

So, according to my reasoning, the liability is $1600, expense is $1200. That's option G.

The correct answer is G: $1600 $1200.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Vacation Liability:**
   - The second employee did not take any vacation and has two weeks accrued. 
   - Each week of vacation for this employee is worth $800.
   - Liability = 2 weeks × $800 = $1,600.

2. **Vacation Expense:**
   - The first employee took two weeks of vacation.
   - Each week of vacation for this employee is worth $600.
   - Expense = 2 weeks × $600 = $1,200.
   - The second employee did not take any vacation, so no expense is incurred.
   - Total expense = $1,200.

3. **Matching the Options:**
   - Liability = $1,600.
   - Expense = $1,200.
   - This matches option G.

**Answer:** G
