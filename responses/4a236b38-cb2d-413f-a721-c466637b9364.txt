Okay, so I've got this question about bonds, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me see what I remember from my finance class. The question is about finding the price of an 8% bond with 18 years until maturity, and the yield is 9%. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I think bonds are priced based on their coupon payments and the present value of those payments. Since this is an 8% coupon bond, I guess that means it pays 8% of its face value each year. I'm assuming the face value is $100 unless stated otherwise, which is common in these problems.

So, the bond has 18 years left, and the yield to maturity is 9%. Yield to maturity is the discount rate we use to calculate the present value of the bond's future cash flows. The cash flows consist of the annual coupon payments and the final payment of the face value at maturity.

Let me break this down. The coupon payment each year should be 8% of $100, which is $8. Then, at the end of 18 years, the bond will pay back the $100. So, we need to calculate the present value of these two cash flows.

I remember the formula for bond pricing is the sum of the present value of each coupon payment plus the present value of the face value. The present value of an ordinary annuity formula is used for the coupon payments, and the present value of a single sum for the face value.

The formula for the bond price (P) is:

P = C * [1 - (1 + r)^-n] / r + F / (1 + r)^n

Where:
- C is the annual coupon payment
- r is the yield to maturity (YTM)
- n is the number of years to maturity
- F is the face value

Plugging in the numbers:
C = 8% of 100 = $8
r = 9% or 0.09
n = 18
F = $100

So, the first part is the present value of the coupons: 8 * [1 - (1.09)^-18] / 0.09

And the second part is 100 / (1.09)^18

I need to calculate each part separately.

First, let's compute (1.09)^-18. I think this is the same as 1 divided by (1.09)^18. I'm not exactly sure what (1.09)^18 is off the top of my head, but I can approximate it. Alternatively, maybe I can use the rule of 72 to estimate, but that might not be precise enough. Alternatively, I can recall that (1.09)^10 is about 2.367, so (1.09)^18 is (1.09)^10 * (1.09)^8. Let's see, (1.09)^8 is approximately 2.219. So, 2.367 * 2.219 ≈ 5.247. So, (1.09)^18 ≈ 5.247, so (1.09)^-18 ≈ 1/5.247 ≈ 0.1907.

So, 1 - 0.1907 = 0.8093.

Now, the present value of the coupons is 8 * (0.8093 / 0.09). Let's compute that. 0.8093 divided by 0.09 is approximately 8.992. So, 8 * 8.992 ≈ 71.936.

Next, the present value of the face value: 100 / (1.09)^18. As we approximated earlier, (1.09)^18 is about 5.247, so 100 / 5.247 ≈ 19.07.

Adding both parts together: 71.936 + 19.07 ≈ 91.006. Hmm, that's approximately $91.01. Looking at the options, the closest one is A: 91.17. But wait, my approximation might be a bit off because I estimated (1.09)^18 as 5.247. Let me check if that's accurate.

Alternatively, maybe I should use more precise calculations. Let me try to compute (1.09)^18 more accurately. Let's compute it step by step:

1.09^1 = 1.09
1.09^2 = 1.09 * 1.09 = 1.1881
1.09^3 ≈ 1.1881 * 1.09 ≈ 1.2850
1.09^4 ≈ 1.2850 * 1.09 ≈ 1.3926
1.09^5 ≈ 1.3926 * 1.09 ≈ 1.5181
1.09^6 ≈ 1.5181 * 1.09 ≈ 1.6544
1.09^7 ≈ 1.6544 * 1.09 ≈ 1.7998
1.09^8 ≈ 1.7998 * 1.09 ≈ 1.9605
1.09^9 ≈ 1.9605 * 1.09 ≈ 2.1382
1.09^10 ≈ 2.1382 * 1.09 ≈ 2.3301

Wait, in my earlier step, I thought 1.09^10 was about 2.367, but with actual multiplication, it's 2.3301. Hmm, maybe my initial estimate was a bit high. Let's continue:

1.09^11 ≈ 2.3301 * 1.09 ≈ 2.5400
1.09^12 ≈ 2.5400 * 1.09 ≈ 2.7686
1.09^13 ≈ 2.7686 * 1.09 ≈ 3.0171
1.09^14 ≈ 3.0171 * 1.09 ≈ 3.2877
1.09^15 ≈ 3.2877 * 1.09 ≈ 3.5745
1.09^16 ≈ 3.5745 * 1.09 ≈ 3.8826
1.09^17 ≈ 3.8826 * 1.09 ≈ 4.2293
1.09^18 ≈ 4.2293 * 1.09 ≈ 4.6062

Oh, so I was wrong earlier. The actual (1.09)^18 is approximately 4.6062, not 5.247. That changes things. So, (1.09)^18 ≈ 4.6062, which means (1.09)^-18 ≈ 1/4.6062 ≈ 0.2171.

So, 1 - 0.2171 = 0.7829.

Now, the present value of the coupons is 8 * (0.7829 / 0.09). Let's compute 0.7829 / 0.09. 0.09 goes into 0.7829 about 8.699 times. So, 8 * 8.699 ≈ 69.59.

Next, the present value of the face value: 100 / 4.6062 ≈ 21.71.

Adding both parts: 69.59 + 21.71 ≈ 91.30. So, approximately $91.30. Looking at the options, A is 91.17 and E is 105.68. Hmm, 91.30 is close to 91.17, but maybe my calculation is a bit off.

Wait, maybe I should use the exact formula with more precise calculations. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the present value of an annuity formula more accurately.

The present value of the coupons is 8 * [ (1 - (1.09)^-18 ) / 0.09 ]

We have (1.09)^-18 ≈ 0.2171, so 1 - 0.2171 = 0.7829.

So, 0.7829 / 0.09 = 8.6989.

Multiply by 8: 8 * 8.6989 ≈ 69.591.

Then, the face value: 100 * 0.2171 ≈ 21.71.

Total: 69.591 + 21.71 ≈ 91.30.

So, approximately $91.30. The closest option is A: 91.17. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the (1.09)^-18 calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a financial calculator or a more precise method. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the bond price can be calculated using Excel's PV function. But since I can't use Excel now, maybe I can use more accurate estimation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the present value of an annuity, which is [1 - (1 + r)^-n] / r.

So, plugging in the numbers:

PV of coupons = 8 * [1 - (1.09)^-18] / 0.09.

We found that (1.09)^-18 ≈ 0.2171, so:

PV = 8 * (0.7829 / 0.09) = 8 * 8.6989 ≈ 69.591.

Then, the face value: 100 * 0.2171 ≈ 21.71.

Total: 69.591 + 21.71 ≈ 91.30.

Looking at the options, the closest is A:91.17. But wait, maybe my approximation of (1.09)^-18 is a bit off.

Let me try calculating (1.09)^18 more accurately. Let's compute it step by step:

1.09^1 = 1.09
1.09^2 = 1.1881
1.09^3 = 1.1881 * 1.09 = let's compute 1.1881 * 1.09:
1 * 1.09 = 1.09
0.1881 * 1.09 = 0.2047
Total ≈ 1.2947

1.09^3 ≈ 1.2947

1.09^4 = 1.2947 * 1.09:
1 * 1.09 = 1.09
0.2947 * 1.09 ≈ 0.3206
Total ≈ 1.4106

1.09^4 ≈ 1.4106

1.09^5 = 1.4106 * 1.09:
1 * 1.09 = 1.09
0.4106 * 1.09 ≈ 0.4467
Total ≈ 1.5367

1.09^5 ≈ 1.5367

1.09^6 = 1.5367 * 1.09:
1 * 1.09 = 1.09
0.5367 * 1.09 ≈ 0.5840
Total ≈ 1.6747

1.09^6 ≈ 1.6747

1.09^7 = 1.6747 * 1.09:
1 * 1.09 = 1.09
0.6747 * 1.09 ≈ 0.7342
Total ≈ 1.8242

1.09^7 ≈ 1.8242

1.09^8 = 1.8242 * 1.09:
1 * 1.09 = 1.09
0.8242 * 1.09 ≈ 0.9000
Total ≈ 1.9902

1.09^8 ≈ 1.9902

1.09^9 = 1.9902 * 1.09:
1 * 1.09 = 1.09
0.9902 * 1.09 ≈ 1.0793
Total ≈ 2.1695

1.09^9 ≈ 2.1695

1.09^10 = 2.1695 * 1.09:
2 * 1.09 = 2.18
0.1695 * 1.09 ≈ 0.1847
Total ≈ 2.3647

1.09^10 ≈ 2.3647

1.09^11 = 2.3647 * 1.09:
2 * 1.09 = 2.18
0.3647 * 1.09 ≈ 0.4000
Total ≈ 2.58

1.09^11 ≈ 2.58

Wait, 2.3647 * 1.09: Let's compute 2.3647 * 1.09 accurately.

2 * 1.09 = 2.18
0.3647 * 1.09 = 0.3647*1 = 0.3647, 0.3647*0.09=0.0328 → total 0.3975
So total is 2.18 + 0.3975 ≈ 2.5775.

So 1.09^11 ≈ 2.5775.

1.09^12 = 2.5775 * 1.09:
2 * 1.09 = 2.18
0.5775 * 1.09 ≈ 0.5775*1=0.5775, 0.5775*0.09=0.051975 → total ≈ 0.6295
Total ≈ 2.18 + 0.6295 ≈ 2.8095

1.09^12 ≈ 2.8095

1.09^13 = 2.8095 * 1.09:
2 * 1.09 = 2.18
0.8095 * 1.09 ≈ 0.8095*1=0.8095, 0.8095*0.09≈0.072855 → total ≈ 0.88235
Total ≈ 2.18 + 0.88235 ≈ 3.06235

1.09^13 ≈ 3.06235

1.09^14 = 3.06235 * 1.09:
3 * 1.09 = 3.27
0.06235 * 1.09 ≈ 0.06235*1=0.06235, 0.06235*0.09≈0.00561 → total≈0.06796
Total ≈ 3.27 + 0.06796 ≈ 3.33796

1.09^14 ≈ 3.33796

1.09^15 = 3.33796 * 1.09:
3 * 1.09 = 3.27
0.33796 * 1.09 ≈ 0.33796*1=0.33796, 0.33796*0.09≈0.0304164 → total≈0.3683764
Total ≈ 3.27 + 0.3683764 ≈ 3.6383764

1.09^15 ≈ 3.6383764

1.09^16 = 3.6383764 * 1.09:
3 * 1.09 = 3.27
0.6383764 * 1.09 ≈ 0.6383764*1=0.6383764, 0.6383764*0.09≈0.05745388 → total≈0.69583028
Total ≈ 3.27 + 0.69583028 ≈ 3.96583028

1.09^16 ≈ 3.96583

1.09^17 = 3.96583 * 1.09:
3 * 1.09 = 3.27
0.96583 * 1.09 ≈ 0.96583*1=0.96583, 0.96583*0.09≈0.0869247 → total≈1.0527547
Total ≈ 3.27 + 1.0527547 ≈ 4.3227547

1.09^17 ≈ 4.322755

1.09^18 = 4.322755 * 1.09:
4 * 1.09 = 4.36
0.322755 * 1.09 ≈ 0.322755*1=0.322755, 0.322755*0.09≈0.029048 → total≈0.351803
Total ≈ 4.36 + 0.351803 ≈ 4.711803

Wait, that's different from my previous calculation. Earlier, I thought it was around 4.6062, but now it's about 4.7118. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check 1.09^18 using a different approach.

Alternatively, I can use the rule of 72 to estimate the doubling time. 72 divided by 9 is about 8, so the money doubles every 8 years. So in 18 years, which is about 2.25 doubling periods (since 8*2=16, leaving 2 years). So, starting from 1.09^8≈2.19, then 1.09^16≈2.19^2≈4.7961. Then, 1.09^18 is 1.09^16 * 1.09^2 ≈ 4.7961 * 1.1881 ≈ let's compute that.

4.7961 * 1.1881: Let's approximate.

4 * 1.1881 = 4.7524
0.7961 * 1.1881 ≈ 0.7961*1=0.7961, 0.7961*0.1881≈0.1501 → total≈0.9462
So total ≈4.7524 + 0.9462≈5.6986.

Wait, that's conflicting with the previous step-by-step calculation which gave me 4.7118 for 1.09^18. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me check using a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the value of (1.09)^18. But since I'm doing this manually, maybe I should accept that I might have made an error in the manual calculation. Let me accept that (1.09)^18 is approximately 4.7118, so (1.09)^-18 ≈ 1/4.7118≈0.2122.

So, 1 - 0.2122 = 0.7878.

Then, the present value of the coupons is 8 * (0.7878 / 0.09). Let's compute 0.7878 / 0.09 ≈ 8.7533. Multiply by 8: 8 * 8.7533 ≈70.0264.

Then, present value of face value: 100 * 0.2122 ≈21.22.

Total bond price: 70.0264 +21.22 ≈91.2464, approximately $91.25.

Looking at the options, A is 91.17, which is very close. So, the answer should be A: 91.17.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated using the more accurate step-by-step, I got 1.09^18 ≈4.7118, leading to a bond price around $91.25, which is close to option A:91.17. So, considering possible rounding during calculations, A seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation using a financial calculator would give a more precise value. For example, using the formula:

Bond Price = (C * [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r) + (F / (1 + r)^n)

Plugging in:

C=8, r=0.09, n=18, F=100.

Calculating:

First part: 8 * [1 - (1.09)^-18] / 0.09

Second part: 100 / (1.09)^18

If I compute (1.09)^18 accurately, perhaps with a calculator, it would be around 4.7118. So, 1/(1.09)^18 ≈0.2122.

So:

First part: 8 * (1 - 0.2122)/0.09 = 8*(0.7878)/0.09 =8*(8.7533)=70.0264

Second part: 100 * 0.2122=21.22

Total:70.0264+21.22=91.2464 ≈91.25

But the option is 91.17, which is very close. Perhaps the slight difference is due to using more precise decimal places in the calculation. Alternatively, maybe I should use the exact formula with more precise numbers.

Wait, perhaps I can use the present value of an annuity factor. The annuity factor for 18 years at 9% is [1 - (1.09)^-18]/0.09.

As we calculated, (1.09)^-18≈0.2122, so 1 - 0.2122=0.7878.

0.7878 /0.09=8.7533.

So, annuity factor=8.7533. Multiply by 8: 8 *8.7533=70.0264.

Then, face value present value:100 *0.2122=21.22.

Total:70.0264+21.22=91.2464.

Rounded to two decimal places, that's $91.25. The option A is 91.17, which is slightly lower. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the face value is $1000 instead of $100? Wait, the question says an 8% bond, which typically refers to a coupon rate of 8% per year on a face value of $100 or $1000. If the face value is $1000, then the coupon is $80, and the calculations would be different.

Wait, I think I assumed face value is $100, but in reality, bonds are usually $1000. Let me check the question again. It says "an 8% bond," which typically implies an 8% coupon on a $1000 face value. Oh, I think I made a mistake here. So, the face value is $1000, not $100.

So, let's recalculate with F=1000.

C=8% of 1000=80.

r=9% or 0.09.

n=18.

So, bond price P=80*[1 - (1.09)^-18]/0.09 + 1000*(1.09)^-18.

We already determined (1.09)^-18≈0.2122.

So:

First part:80*(1 -0.2122)/0.09 =80*(0.7878)/0.09 =80*8.7533≈700.264.

Second part:1000*0.2122≈212.2.

Total P=700.264 +212.2≈912.464, so approximately $912.46.

But the options are all under $120, which suggests that the face value is $100. Hmm, this is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the bond is priced as a percentage of face value, so 8% coupon on a $100 face value, making the coupon $8, as I initially thought.

Wait, but in that case, the options are in the range of 77 to 120, which would make sense for a $100 bond. So, perhaps the face value is $100.

Wait, but in that case, with the calculations leading to approximately $91.25, the closest option is A:91.17.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for (1.09)^-18.

Let me compute (1.09)^18 more accurately. Using a calculator:

1.09^2=1.1881

1.09^3=1.2850

1.09^4=1.3926

1.09^5=1.5181

1.09^6=1.6544

1.09^7=1.7998

1.09^8=1.9605

1.09^9=2.1382

1.09^10=2.3674

1.09^11=2.5937

1.09^12=2.8425

1.09^13=3.1102

1.09^14=3.3985

1.09^15=3.7169

1.09^16=4.0765

1.09^17=4.4735

1.09^18=4.9194

Ah, so (1.09)^18 is approximately 4.9194. Therefore, (1.09)^-18≈1/4.9194≈0.2033.

So, 1 - 0.2033=0.7967.

Now, present value of coupons:8 * (0.7967 /0.09)=8 *8.8522≈70.8176.

Present value of face value:100 *0.2033≈20.33.

Total bond price≈70.8176+20.33≈91.1476, which is approximately $91.15.

The options are A:91.17, which is very close. So, the correct answer should be A:91.17.
</think>

To determine the price of an 8% bond with 18 years to maturity and a yield of 9%, we calculate the present value of its future cash flows. The bond's annual coupon payment is $8 (8% of $100 face value), and the face value of $100 is paid at maturity. Using the yield to maturity (9%) as the discount rate, the bond price is calculated as:

\[
P = C \times \left( \frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r} \right) + \frac{F}{(1 + r)^n}
\]

Where:
- \( C = 8 \)
- \( r = 0.09 \)
- \( n = 18 \)
- \( F = 100 \)

Calculating \((1.09)^{-18} \approx 0.2033\), the present value of coupons is:

\[
8 \times \left( \frac{1 - 0.2033}{0.09} \right) \approx 70.82
\]

The present value of the face value is:

\[
100 \times 0.2033 \approx 20.33
\]

Adding these gives a bond price of approximately $91.15, which rounds to the closest option, **91.17**.

**Answer:** A
