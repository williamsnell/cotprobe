Okay, so I need to solve the quadratic equation x² -5x +6 =0 using the quadratic formula. Hmm, let me remember how that works. The quadratic formula is x equals negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus four a c, all over 2a. Right?

In the equation, the coefficients are a=1, b=-5, and c=6. So plugging those into the formula, I get x = [5 ± sqrt( (-5)² -4*1*6 )]/(2*1). Let me calculate the discriminant first. That's b² -4ac, which is 25 minus 24, so 1. The square root of 1 is 1. So now the formula becomes x = [5 ±1]/2.

That gives two solutions. The first one is (5 +1)/2 =6/2=3. The second is (5-1)/2=4/2=2. So the roots are x=3 and x=2. Looking at the options, option D says x=3 and x=2. So that must be the correct answer.
