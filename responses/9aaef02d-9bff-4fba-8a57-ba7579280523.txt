Okay, so I have this question about the Ideal Moral Code theory. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my ethics, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking what the theory says about one's obligation. The options are A through J, each describing a different scenario.

First, I remember that the Ideal Moral Code theory is related to moral philosophy, probably under the umbrella of consequentialism or maybe deontology. Wait, no, I think it's more about hypothetical ethics. Oh right, it's connected to the idea of moral rules as they apply in an idealized situation.

So the theory states that one is obligated to do what the ideal moral rules would require. Now, the key here is understanding what "ideal moral rules" imply about the context in which they're applied. I think it's about a hypothetical society where these rules are perfectly followed. Because if everyone followed the rules perfectly, then the rules would be effective and just, creating the best possible outcomes.

Looking at the options, the question is about the scenario in which the obligation applies. Option J says "in a hypothetical society with perfect moral rules." That seems to fit because the theory is about what you'd do under ideal conditions, not the real world. So the obligation is based on how things would work if everyone followed the rules perfectly, even if that's not the actual case.

Wait, let me check the other options to be sure. Option B says "in a world where everyone complied with those rules perfectly." That sounds similar to J, but I think J is more about the hypothetical society aspect. Option C is about an ideal institutional setting, which is more about structures rather than the rules themselves. Option G mentions imperfect compliance, which is more about the real world, not ideal. Option H is about actual settings, which is again real, not hypothetical.

So I think J is the correct answer because the theory is about a hypothetical society where the rules are perfectly followed, making the rules ideal. Therefore, the obligation is to follow those ideal rules as they would apply in that perfect scenario.

The Ideal Moral Code theory focuses on the hypothetical scenario where moral rules are perfectly followed, creating an ideal society. Therefore, the obligation is to adhere to these rules in such a hypothetical setting.

Answer: J
