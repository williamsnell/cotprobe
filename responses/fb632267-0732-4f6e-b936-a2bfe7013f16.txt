Okay, so I have this question about construction terms, specifically about vertical structures. The question is asking which of the given options are the vertical structures in a wall. The first part mentions that plates are horizontal at the top and bottom of a wall. So, I need to figure out what the vertical parts are called.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Studs. I remember from building classes that studs are the vertical pieces in a wall. They're like the main supports running up and down between the top and bottom plates. So that's probably a vertical structure.

Option B: Sheathing. Sheathing is the material that covers the outside of the wall, right? It's horizontal because it's attached to the studs. So sheathing isn't vertical; it's more like a covering.

Option C: Rafters. Rafters are in the roof, the slanted parts that form the slope. They're definitely not vertical; they're diagonal.

Option D: Beams. Beams are usually horizontal supports, maybe in floors or ceilings. They can be long and straight, so they're horizontal.

Option E: Trusses. Trusses are like the framework in roofs, made up of triangles for strength. They're structural but not vertical; they have both horizontal and diagonal parts.

Option F: Girders. Girders are large beams that support floors or roofs. They're usually horizontal, spanning across areas.

Option G: Sill plates. Sill plates are at the bottom of the wall, sitting on the foundation. They're horizontal, so not vertical.

Option H: Headers. Headers are the horizontal pieces at the top of a window or door opening. They support the weight above, so they're horizontal.

Option I: Purlins. Purlins are in roofs, running perpendicular to the rafters. They're horizontal supports for the rafters, so not vertical.

Option J: Joists. Joists are the horizontal structural elements in floors and ceilings, supporting the floor boards. Definitely horizontal.

Putting it all together, the only option that stands out as a vertical structure is A: Studs. They run vertically between the top and bottom plates, making them the vertical parts of the wall.

The vertical structures in a wall are studs, which run between the top and bottom plates.
