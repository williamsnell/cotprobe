Question:

After being passed over for a promotion, an aeronautic engineer became a whistleblower. He contacted a government agency to state that the company for which he worked was submitting false safety reports on newly built aircraft. When the company learned that the engineer was leaking this information to the government agency, he was fired from his job. Afterward, the engineer sued the company for wrongful termination of employment. During the discovery stage of litigation, the engineer was deposed by the company's attorney. In his deposition, the engineer stated that the company submitted false safety reports to the government agency to cover up structural defects in its aircraft. A pilot was injured when one of the company'sairplanes he was piloting crashed. The pilot asserteda strict products liability tort against the company. At thal, the pilot seeks to introduce into evidence portions of the engineer's deposition from his wrongful termination lawsuit against the company. Assume that the engineer is unavailable to testify at trial. Upon objection by the company, the trial court judge should rule the engineer's deposition testimony

Options:

A: admissible as former testimony.
B: inadmissible as hearsay within the business records exception.
C: inadmissible due to the engineer's unavailability.
D: admissible as a statement against interest.
E: admissible as a vicarious admission.
F: inadmissible, because the company did not have the opportunity to cross-examine the engineer on the liability issue for which the statement is now being offered.
G: admissible as a dying declaration.
H: inadmissible because the engineer's deposition is biased.
I: inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.
J: admissible as a statement of personal or family history.

Okay, so I've got this question about evidence law, specifically about hearsay exceptions and deposition testimony. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: An aeronautical engineer was passed over for a promotion and then became a whistleblower. He told a government agency that his company was submitting false safety reports on new aircraft. The company found out and fired him, and he sued for wrongful termination. During his deposition in that lawsuit, he stated that the company submitted false reports to cover up structural defects. Now, a pilot was injured when one of the company's planes crashed, and the pilot is suing the company in a strict products liability case. The pilot wants to use parts of the engineer's deposition as evidence. The engineer isn't available to testify now, so his deposition is being offered.

The question is about the admissibility of the engineer's deposition testimony in the pilot's lawsuit. The company objects, and the judge has to decide.

I need to figure out which exception to the hearsay rule applies here, if any, or if there's another reason it might be inadmissible.

Let's recall some hearsay exceptions. There's the former testimony exception, which applies when the witness is unavailable and the testimony was given in a previous proceeding where the party had the opportunity to cross-examine. Then there's the statement against interest exception, where a statement is admissible if it was against the declarant's pecuniary or proprietary interest at the time it was made.

In this case, the deposition was taken in a wrongful termination case where the engineer was suing the company. So, the engineer was the plaintiff in that case, and the company was the defendant. In his deposition, he made statements that incriminate his former employer, the same company now being sued by the pilot.

Wait, but the engineer's statements in the deposition would be against the company's interest. But does that make them admissible under the statement against interest exception? Or is there another angle?

Wait, the statement against interest exception requires that the statement was against the declarant's interest when made. Here, the engineer was suing the company, so his statements were against the company's interests but in his own interest. Wait, no—if he was suing the company, making statements that the company did wrong would actually support his case, so it's not against his own interest. So maybe the statement against interest doesn't apply here because it wasn't against his interest at the time.

Wait, no, the company is the same in both cases. So in the wrongful termination case, the engineer's statements about the false reports would be against the company's interest because it shows they did something wrong. But the statement against interest exception is about the declarant's own interest, not a third party. So if the engineer's statement is against the company's interest, but not his own, then it wouldn't qualify as a statement against his own interest. So D might not be the right answer.

Another exception is the former testimony. Under the former testimony exception, if the declarant is unavailable and the testimony was given in a prior proceeding where the party (here, the company) had the opportunity to cross-examine, then it's admissible. In this case, the engineer was a plaintiff in the wrongful termination case, so the company would have had the opportunity to cross-examine him during his deposition. Now, in the pilot's case, the engineer is unavailable, so his deposition would be admissible as former testimony.

Wait, but wait—let me think again. The former testimony exception requires that the testimony was given in a proceeding where the party (the company) had an opportunity to cross-examine. In the wrongful termination case, the company was the defendant, and the engineer was the plaintiff. So, yes, the company would have had the opportunity to cross-examine him. So the deposition would fall under the former testimony exception, making it admissible as former testimony. That would be option A.

But wait, another point: the statements in the deposition are being offered in a case where the company is the defendant again. So the company had a chance to cross-examine in the prior proceeding. So that fits the former testimony exception.

Alternatively, could it be a vicarious admission? Vicarious admissions are statements made by someone with authority over the subject, which adopt the statements as the party's own. But the engineer was an employee, but in this case, he was making statements against the company, so it's more like an opposing statement. So maybe not a vicarious admission.

Another angle: the deposition was in a different case, but the same parties. So the engineer's statements were made under oath, and the company had the chance to cross-examine. So former testimony applies.

Wait, but in the pilot's case, the engineer is unavailable. So the deposition would be used as former testimony, making it admissible. So the answer would be A.

But let me check the other options. Option E is vicarious admission, which I think doesn't apply here because the engineer was not acting on behalf of the company when he made the statements; he was acting as a whistleblower, so his statements were against the company's interests, not on behalf.

Option F says inadmissible because the company didn't have the opportunity to cross-examine on the liability issue. But in the prior deposition, the company did cross-examine him, so that's not the case. So F is incorrect.

Option I says inadmissible as hearsay not within any exception. But since former testimony applies, I is incorrect.

Option C says inadmissible due to the engineer's unavailability, but the former testimony exception allows for admissibility when the witness is unavailable, so C is incorrect.

So, putting it all together, the deposition should be admissible as former testimony under option A.

The engineer's deposition testimony is admissible as former testimony because it was given under oath in a prior proceeding where the company had the opportunity to cross-examine him. The engineer's unavailability does not bar its admissibility under the former testimony exception. 

Answer: A
