Okay, so I've got this question about vapor pressures of water and chloroform. Hmm, I remember that vapor pressure changes with temperature, and it's related to the heat of vaporization. Wait, the question says that water boils at 100°C and chloroform at 60°C, but I need to find when their vapor pressures are the same. 

I think I should use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation here. The equation is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔHvap/R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2). But wait, since I'm looking for the temperature where their vapor pressures are equal, maybe I should set their vapor pressures equal and compare their equations.

Wait, the vapor pressure equation can be written as P = P0 * exp(-ΔHvap/(R*T)). But since each substance has its own P0, I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, since at their boiling points, their vapor pressures are 1 atm. But wait, maybe I can use the fact that at their boiling points, the vapor pressures are equal to atmospheric pressure (assuming standard conditions), but the problem might be assuming that their vapor pressures start from a reference point, perhaps at a common temperature.

Wait, no, the problem is probably assuming that at a certain temperature T, both have the same vapor pressure. So I can set their vapor pressure equations equal at that T.

Wait, but vapor pressure can also be expressed using the Antoine equation or the Arrhenius equation, but maybe using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation in a form that relates vapor pressure to temperature is better. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the relationship between the two substances' vapor pressures as a function of temperature.

Alternatively, I can think in terms of the relation between their boiling points and heats of vaporization. The idea is that the vapor pressure increases with temperature. So, perhaps I can set up the equation where the vapor pressure of water at T equals that of chloroform at T.

Wait, but the vapor pressure of a liquid at its boiling point is 1 atm. So, for water at 100°C (373 K), P_water = 1 atm. For chloroform at 60°C (333 K), P_chloroform = 1 atm. But we're looking for a temperature T where their vapor pressures are equal, but not necessarily 1 atm.

Wait, maybe I should express the vapor pressure of each as a function of temperature and set them equal. So, for each substance, the vapor pressure P is given by:

P = P0 * exp(-ΔHvap/(R*T))

But I'm not sure what P0 is here. Alternatively, maybe using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation in a way that relates the two substances. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to relate the vapor pressures at their respective boiling points and then find where they intersect.

Wait, another approach: At their boiling points, their vapor pressures are both 1 atm. So, maybe I can write the vapor pressure equation for each as a function of temperature and find where they're equal.

So, for water: P_water(T) = P0_water * exp(-ΔH_water/(R*T))
Similarly, for chloroform: P_chloroform(T) = P0_chloroform * exp(-ΔH_chloroform/(R*T))

But without knowing P0, maybe I can set their ratio equal when P_water = P_chloroform.

Wait, but perhaps I can use the fact that at their boiling points, their vapor pressures are 1 atm. So, when T = 373 K for water, P_water = 1 atm. Similarly, when T = 333 K for chloroform, P_chloroform = 1 atm.

So, for water, 1 = P0_water * exp(-12000 cal/(8.314 J/mol·K * 373 K))
Wait, wait, the units need to match. Oh, ΔH is given in kcal/mol. So 12 kcal/mol is 12 * 1000 cal/mol = 12000 cal/mol.

Wait, R is 8.314 J/(mol·K). Oh, but cal and J are different. Since 1 cal = 4.184 J. So, 12000 cal = 12000 * 4.184 J = 50,208 J/mol.

So for water: 1 = P0_water * exp(-50208 / (8.314 * 373))

Similarly, for chloroform, at 333 K: 1 = P0_chloroform * exp(-7000 cal/mol * 4.184 J/cal / (8.314 * 333)).

Wait, 7 kcal/mol is 7000 cal/mol, so that's 7000 *4.184 = 29288 J/mol.

So, 1 = P0_chloroform * exp(-29288/(8.314 * 333)).

So, I can write P0_water = 1 / exp(-50208/(8.314*373)) = exp(50208/(8.314*373))

Similarly, P0_chloroform = 1 / exp(-29288/(8.314*333)) = exp(29288/(8.314*333)).

But I'm not sure if this helps me. Maybe another approach is better.

Alternatively, perhaps using the ratio of their vapor pressures as a function of temperature. Let me think: at a certain temperature T, P_water(T) = P_chloroform(T).

So, (P_water/P0_water) = (P_chloroform/P0_chloroform)

But that might not be helpful unless I can relate P0.

Wait, maybe I can consider that the vapor pressures at the same temperature T can be expressed using their respective Antoine equations, but I don't recall the exact coefficients. Alternatively, perhaps using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation in a way that compares the two.

Wait, maybe I can find the temperature where the ratio of their vapor pressures equals 1.

So, P_water(T) / P_chloroform(T) = 1.

Using the relation ln(P/T) = -ΔH/(R T) + constant. Alternatively, perhaps using the equation that the slope of ln P vs 1/T is -ΔH/R.

Wait, maybe I can set up two equations for each substance at their boiling points and then find the T where their P's are equal.

Wait, let me think. Let me denote:

For water, at T1=373 K, P1=1 atm.

For chloroform, at T2=333 K, P2=1 atm.

We need to find T where P_water(T) = P_chloroform(T) = P.

Using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation for each:

ln(P / P1) = -(ΔH_water)/(R) * (1/T - 1/T1)
Similarly, ln(P / P2) = -(ΔH_chloroform)/(R) * (1/T - 1/T2)

Since P1 = P2 = 1 atm, the equations become:

ln(P) = ln(1) - (ΔH_water/R) * (1/T - 1/373) → ln(P) = -(ΔH_water/R)(1/T - 1/373)

And for chloroform:

ln(P) = -(ΔH_chloroform/R)(1/T - 1/333)

Since both equal ln(P), set them equal:

-(ΔH_water/R)(1/T - 1/373) = -(ΔH_chloroform/R)(1/T - 1/333)

The R and negatives cancel out:

ΔH_water (1/T - 1/373) = ΔH_chloroform (1/T - 1/333)

Let me plug in the numbers. ΔH_water is 12 kcal/mol, which is 12000 cal/mol. ΔH_chloroform is 7 kcal/mol = 7000 cal/mol.

Wait, but R is in J/(mol·K), so I need to convert the heats of vaporization to J.

Wait, 1 cal = 4.184 J, so:

ΔH_water = 12000 cal/mol * 4.184 J/cal = 50208 J/mol

ΔH_chloroform = 7000 cal/mol *4.184 J/cal ≈ 29288 J/mol

So, substituting:

50208 (1/T - 1/373) = 29288 (1/T - 1/333)

Let me expand both sides:

50208*(1/T) - 50208*(1/373) = 29288*(1/T) - 29288*(1/333)

Bring all terms to one side:

50208*(1/T) - 29288*(1/T) = 50208*(1/373) - 29288*(1/333)

Factor out 1/T on the left:

(50208 - 29288) * (1/T) = 50208/373 - 29288/333

Calculate the coefficients:

50208 - 29288 = 20920

So:

20920 / T = (50208/373) - (29288/333)

Compute the right-hand side:

50208 / 373 ≈ let's calculate:

373 * 134 = 373*130=48490, 373*4=1492 → 48490+1492=49982. So 50208 ≈ 134.75 (since 49982 + 226 ≈ 50208 → 226 /373 ≈ 0.606 → ~134.606)

Similarly, 29288 / 333 ≈ let's see: 333 * 87 = 28911, 29288-28911=377. 377/333 ≈1.13, so total ≈87 +1.13 =88.13.

So the right-hand side is approximately 134.606 - 88.13 = 46.476.

So:

20920 / T = 46.476 → T = 20920 /46.476 ≈ let's calculate.

20920 ÷46.476 ≈ let's see, 46.476 * 450 ≈ 46.476*400=18590.4, 46.476*50=2323.8 → 18590.4 +2323.8=20914.2. So 450 gives about 20914.2, which is very close to 20920. So T ≈450 K.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is 448 K, which is close. Maybe my approximations are a bit off.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let me compute 50208/373:

373 × 134 = 49982 → 50208 -49982=226 → 226/373 ≈0.606. So 134.606.

Similarly, 29288/333:

333 ×88=29244 → 29288-29244=44 → 44/333≈0.132 → 88.132.

So 134.606 -88.132 =46.474.

So 20920 / T =46.474 → T=20920 /46.474 ≈450.0 K.

But the options don't have 450 K. Wait, option F is 448 K, which is close. Maybe my approximations have errors.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let me compute 50208/373 precisely.

373 × 134 = 49982 → 50208-49982=226.

226 / 373 = approximately 0.606.

So 134.606.

Similarly, 29288/333:

333 ×88 =29244 → 29288-29244=44.

44/333≈0.1321 →88.1321.

So 134.606 -88.1321=46.4739.

So 20920 /46.4739 = ?

Let me compute 20920 ÷46.4739.

Let me compute 46.4739 × 450 = ?

46 ×450 =20700.

0.4739 ×450 ≈213.255.

So total ≈20700 +213.255=20913.255. The numerator is 20920.

Difference is 20920 -20913.255 =6.745.

So 6.745 /46.4739 ≈0.145.

So 450.145 → approximately 450.15 K.

But wait, the options don't include 450. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: 333K

B:373K

C:500K

D:523K

E:350K

F:448K

G:470K

H:310K

I:385K

J:400K

Hmm, 450 K isn't an option. The closest is F:448 K. But perhaps my calculation has a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me re-examine the equations.

The setup was:

ΔH_water (1/T - 1/373) = ΔH_chloroform (1/T - 1/333)

Wait, but wait, the equation comes from:

ln(P_water) = -(ΔH_water/R)(1/T - 1/373)

ln(P_chloroform) = -(ΔH_chloroform/R)(1/T - 1/333)

At the temperature T where P_water = P_chloroform, their ln(P) must be equal. So:

-(ΔH_water/R)(1/T - 1/373) = -(ΔH_chloroform/R)(1/T - 1/333)

Canceling negatives and R:

ΔH_water (1/T -1/373) = ΔH_chloroform (1/T -1/333)

Which is correct.

So perhaps I need to compute more accurately.

Let me compute each term exactly.

Compute 50208*(1/T - 1/373) = 29288*(1/T -1/333)

Expanding:

50208/T -50208/373 =29288/T -29288/333

Bring all terms to left:

50208/T -29288/T =50208/373 -29288/333

(50208 -29288)/T = 50208/373 -29288/333

As before, 50208-29288=20920.

So 20920/T = (50208/373) - (29288/333)

Compute each fraction accurately:

50208 ÷373:

Compute 373 ×134. Let me compute 134×373:

134×300=40200

134×70=9380 → 40200+9380=49580

134×3=402 →49580+402=49982

So 50208-49982=226.

So 226/373 ≈0.6064 →134.6064.

Similarly, 29288 ÷333:

333 ×88=29244 →29288-29244=44.

So 44/333 ≈0.1321 →88.1321.

So 50208/373 ≈134.6064

29288/333≈88.1321

So 134.6064 -88.1321 =46.4743.

Thus, 20920 /T =46.4743 → T=20920 /46.4743 ≈ let's compute exactly.

Dividing 20920 by 46.4743.

Compute 46.4743 ×450 = ?

46 ×450=20700

0.4743×450=213.435 → total 20700+213.435=20913.435.

The numerator is 20920.

So 20920 -20913.435=6.565.

So 6.565 /46.4743 ≈0.141.

So T≈450.141 K.

But the options don't have 450. The closest is F:448 K. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in calculations?

Wait, perhaps I should compute 20920 ÷46.4743 exactly.

Let me use a calculator approach.

Compute 46.4743 ×450 =20913.435 → remainder 6.565.

Now, 6.565 /46.4743 ≈0.141.

So T≈450.141 K.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the assumption that P_water and P_chloroform equal 1 atm at their boiling points is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the fact that at their boiling points, the vapor pressure is 1 atm, and model the vapor pressures using the Antoine equation.

Wait, the Antoine equation is:

log10(P) = A - (B/(T + C))

For water, the Antoine constants (at certain temperature ranges) are A=8.14019, B=1810.94, C=244.485, valid from 1 to 100°C.

For chloroform, the constants are A=6.63663, B=1299.76, C=237.428, valid from 21.8 to 64.2°C.

Wait, maybe using these would give a more accurate result. But I'm not sure if I can compute this accurately without a calculator.

Alternatively, perhaps I can try using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation again but more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the right-hand side more accurately.

Compute 50208/(373) = 50208 ÷373.

Compute 373 ×134=49982, as before. 50208-49982=226. So 226/373 ≈0.606434.

So 50208/373 ≈134.606434.

Similarly, 29288 ÷333.

333 ×88=29244, 29288-29244=44. So 44/333=0.132114.

So 29288/333≈88.132114.

So the difference is 134.606434 -88.132114=46.47432.

So 20920 /46.47432 = ?

Compute 46.47432 ×450 =20913.444.

20920-20913.444=6.556.

So 6.556 /46.47432 ≈0.141.

So T≈450.141 K.

But again, no option at 450 K. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the equation is (ΔH_water / ΔH_chloroform) = [ (1/T - 1/373) ] / [ (1/T - 1/333) ]

Wait, no, the equation is:

ΔH_water (1/T -1/373) = ΔH_chloroform (1/T -1/333)

Which can be rewritten as:

(ΔH_water / ΔH_chloroform) = [ (1/T -1/333) ] / [ (1/T -1/373) ]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to solve for 1/T.

Let me denote x = 1/T.

Then the equation becomes:

ΔH_water (x - 1/373) = ΔH_chloroform (x -1/333)

Expand:

ΔH_water x - (ΔH_water / 373) = ΔH_chloroform x - (ΔH_chloroform / 333)

Bring all x terms to left and constants to right:

ΔH_water x - ΔH_chloroform x = (ΔH_water /373) - (ΔH_chloroform /333)

Factor x:

x (ΔH_water - ΔH_chloroform) = (ΔH_water /373) - (ΔH_chloroform /333)

So,

x = [ (ΔH_water/373) - (ΔH_chloroform/333) ] / (ΔH_water - ΔH_chloroform )

Substituting the values:

ΔH_water =50208 J/mol, ΔH_chloroform=29288 J/mol.

So,

x = [ (50208/373) - (29288/333) ] / (50208 -29288 )

Compute numerator:

50208/373 ≈134.6064

29288/333≈88.1321

So numerator ≈134.6064 -88.1321 =46.4743.

Denominator:50208-29288=20920.

So x=46.4743 /20920 ≈0.002221.

So T=1/x ≈1/0.002221≈450.2 K.

Again, same result. So perhaps the correct answer is approximately 450 K, but the options don't have it. The closest is F:448 K, which is about 2 K less.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the heats of vaporization. Let me double-check.

Wait, 12 kcal/mol is 12,000 cal/mol. 1 cal=4.184 J, so 12,000 *4.184=50,208 J/mol, correct.

7 kcal/mol=7,000 cal/mol →7,000 *4.184=29,288 J/mol, correct.

Hmm. So perhaps the intended answer is 450 K, but since it's not an option, maybe I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the question intended to ignore the unit conversion and use kcal directly with R in cal/(mol·K). Let me try that.

Wait, R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), but if I use R in cal/(mol·K), it's 8.314 J/(mol·K) = 8.314 /4.184 ≈1.987 cal/(mol·K).

Wait, let me try that approach.

So:

ΔH_water =12 kcal/mol =12,000 cal/mol.

ΔH_chloroform=7 kcal/mol=7,000 cal/mol.

R≈1.987 cal/(mol·K).

So the equation becomes:

12000 (1/T -1/373) =7000 (1/T -1/333)

Divide both sides by 1000:

12 (1/T -1/373) =7 (1/T -1/333)

Expand:

12/T -12/373 =7/T -7/333

Bring all terms to left:

12/T -7/T =12/373 -7/333

(5/T) = (12/373 -7/333)

Compute right side:

12/373 ≈0.032166

7/333≈0.021021

So difference≈0.032166 -0.021021=0.011145.

So,

5/T =0.011145 → T=5/0.011145 ≈449.2 K.

Again, approximately 449 K, which rounds to 450 K. But the options don't have this.

Wait, but option F is 448 K. Maybe the intended answer is F:448 K.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me check another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using the relation that the vapor pressures are equal when the ratio of their heats of vaporization times the reciprocal of (1/T -1/T1) is equal.

Wait, perhaps using the equation:

ln(P_water/P_chloroform) = (ΔH_chloroform - ΔH_water)/(R) * (1/T)

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to find T where their logarithms of vapor pressures are equal, but I think I've done that correctly.

Given that, perhaps the intended answer is F:448 K, but according to my calculation, it's around 450 K. Alternatively, perhaps I should check if I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for 50208/373 and 29288/333.

Compute 50208 ÷373:

373 ×134=49982. 50208-49982=226.

226 ÷373=0.606434.

So 134.606434.

29288 ÷333:

333 ×88=29244. 29288-29244=44.

44 ÷333=0.132114.

So 88.132114.

So difference is 134.606434 -88.132114=46.47432.

So 20920 ÷46.47432 = ?

Let me compute 46.47432 ×448 = ?

46 ×448 = 20,608.

0.47432 ×448 ≈0.47432 *400=189.728; 0.47432*48≈22.767. So total ≈189.728 +22.767≈212.495.

So 46.47432 ×448 ≈20,608 +212.495=20,820.495.

But 20920 is larger than that. The difference is 20920 -20820.495=99.505.

So 99.505 ÷46.47432 ≈2.141.

So 448 +2.141≈450.141 K.

So, 20920 ÷46.47432≈450.141 K.

So, the correct answer should be approximately 450 K, but the closest option is F:448 K, which is 2 K less. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is F:448 K, considering rounding or a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should try using logarithms again, but perhaps using the Antoine equation would be more accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is F:448 K.
</think>

To determine the temperature at which water and chloroform have the same vapor pressure, we use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. The equation relates the vapor pressure of a substance to its temperature and enthalpy of vaporization. For two substances, the condition for equal vapor pressures is derived as:

\[
\Delta H_{\text{water}} \left( \frac{1}{T} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{water}}} \right) = \Delta H_{\text{chloroform}} \left( \frac{1}{T} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{chloroform}}} \right)
\]

Where:
- \( T_{\text{water}} = 373 \, \text{K} \) (boiling point of water),
- \( T_{\text{chloroform}} = 333 \, \text{K} \) (boiling point of chloroform),
- \( \Delta H_{\text{water}} = 12 \, \text{kcal/mol} = 50,208 \, \text{J/mol} \),
- \( \Delta H_{\text{chloroform}} = 7 \, \text{kcal/mol} = 29,288 \, \text{J/mol} \).

Rearranging and solving for \( T \), we find:

\[
T \approx 450 \, \text{K}.
\]

However, the closest option provided is \( 448 \, \text{K} \), which likely accounts for rounding or approximations in the problem setup.

**Answer: F**
