Okay, so I've got this question about correlation coefficients and how they relate to the percentage of variation explained. Hmm, I remember that the correlation coefficient, often denoted as r, measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details, so I need to think this through carefully.

The question is asking: A correlation of 0.6 indicates that the percentage of variation in y explained by x is how many times the percentage indicated by a correlation of 0.3? So, I need to find the ratio of the explained variation when r is 0.6 versus when r is 0.3.

Wait, I think the key here is the coefficient of determination, which I believe is r squared. Right, r squared represents the proportion of variance in one variable that's predictable from the other variable. So, if r is 0.6, then r squared would be 0.36, which is 36% of the variation in y explained by x. Similarly, if r is 0.3, then r squared is 0.09, which is 9%.

So the question is, how many times greater is 36% compared to 9%? To find that, I divide 36 by 9, which gives me 4. So the percentage explained by r=0.6 is 4 times that of r=0.3.

Wait, but let me make sure. The correlation coefficient itself is r, and the coefficient of determination is r². So, the percentage of variation explained is r². So, for r=0.6, it's 0.36 (36%), and for r=0.3, it's 0.09 (9%). So 36 divided by 9 is indeed 4. That would mean the answer is 4 times.

Looking at the options, option B is 4. So the answer should be B.

The correlation coefficient (r) measures the strength of the linear relationship between two variables. The percentage of variation explained is given by the coefficient of determination, which is r squared (r²). For r = 0.6, r² = 0.36 (36% of variation explained). For r = 0.3, r² = 0.09 (9% of variation explained). The ratio of these percentages is 36% / 9% = 4. Thus, the percentage explained by r=0.6 is 4 times that of r=0.3.

Answer: B
