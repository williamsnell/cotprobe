Question:

Upon graduation from high school, a student enrolled in a college close to where he lived. However, since the student did not have a car, he rode the bus to and from the college each day. The student soon discovered that he was spending up to two hours each day to make the round trip to and from college on the bus, whereas the trip could be made in half that time if he had a car. He decided to buy a car and asked his father to accompany him as he looked for a car to purchase. After visiting a number of car lots, the son finally found a used car to his liking. However, the son only had $2,500 in his bank account, and the price of the car was $10,000. Since the son had not built up a credit history, the car lot was reluctant to sell the car to the son. The father then told the finance manager of the car lot, "If you will sell the car to my son and for any reason he defaults on the payments, I will pay the balance due. " The finance manager then approved the deal, which required the son to pay $2,500 down and monthly payments of $500 for 15 months. Six months later, the son defaulted on the payment plan, and the car lot sought recovery from the father without first suing the son. With regard to the father's obligation under his promise to the finance manager, the court would most likely

Options:

A: relieve the father of liability, because the car lot failed to first sue the son.
B: relieve the father of liability, because the father was never under a duty as a surety.
C: not relieve the father of liability, because of the main purpose exception.
D: not relieve the father of liability, because parents are responsible for the debts of their children.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about suretyship and whether the father is liable for his son's car payments. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: A son wants to buy a car but can't because he doesn't have a good credit history. His dad steps in and tells the finance manager that if the son defaults, he'll pay the balance. So the son gets the car, pays $2,500 down, and then $500 a month for 15 months. But six months later, the son stops making payments, and the car lot goes after the father instead of suing the son first. The question is whether the father is liable.

I remember from my studies that when someone acts as a surety, like promising to pay if another party defaults, there are certain rules. One key point is the "main purpose exception." I think that exception applies when the primary purpose of the agreement is to benefit the surety, not the principal debtor. In this case, the son is the principal debtor because he's the one buying the car. His dad's promise was to cover the payments if the son couldn't, so the main purpose was to help the son, not the father. 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The main purpose exception usually applies to defeat the surety's liability, right? So if the main purpose is to benefit the principal debtor, the surety can sometimes avoid liability. But here, the dad's promise was to pay if the son defaults. So the main purpose was to secure the loan for the son, which would mean the main purpose exception doesn't apply, making the father liable.

Alternatively, maybe the car lot didn't sue the son first. I think some rules require the creditor to exhaust all remedies against the primary debtor before going after the surety. But I'm not sure if that applies in every case. I think it's more about the contract terms. If the surety contract says they have to sue the primary first, then maybe they have to. But in this question, the father didn't sign any formal agreement, just made a verbal promise. So maybe the rule about suing the son first doesn't apply here, or the contract terms don't require it because the agreement was verbal.

Also, the father didn't have a duty as a surety unless he promised to be one. Here, he clearly did, so option B says he wasn't under a duty, but I think he was because he made a promise to the finance manager.

So putting it together: The main purpose exception typically applies when the main reason for the suretyship is to benefit the principal debtor (the son here). Since the father's promise was to cover the son's defaults, the main purpose was to help the son get the car. Therefore, the main purpose exception would relieve the father of liability. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because if the main purpose is to benefit the principal, the surety can avoid liability. But in this case, the father's promise was to support the son's obligation, so the main purpose was indeed for the son's benefit. So the court would apply the main purpose exception and relieve the father.

Wait, but I'm a bit conflicted. Because the son needed the car for school, which is a main purpose, so the father's suretyship was to enable that. So under the exception, the father shouldn't be liable because the main purpose was to benefit the son, making the father's obligation voidable.

Alternatively, maybe the main purpose exception doesn't apply here because the father's suretyship was separate. I'm getting a bit tangled. I think the correct answer is C: not relieve the father because of the main purpose exception. Or wait, noâ€”wait, the main purpose exception allows the surety to avoid liability if the primary purpose was to benefit the principal debtor. So in this case, the father's promise was to help the son, so the court would apply the exception and not hold the father liable. But looking at the options, option C says "not relieve" because of the exception, which would mean the father is liable. That doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Wait, no. The main purpose exception actually allows the surety to avoid liability if the primary purpose was to benefit the principal. So if the main purpose was to benefit the son, the father isn't liable. So the court would relieve him. But looking at the options, option A says the father is relieved because the car lot didn't sue the son first. Option C says not relieve because of the main purpose exception. Wait, that's conflicting.

Wait, no. The main purpose exception makes the suretyship voidable if the main purpose was to benefit the principal. So in this case, the father can avoid liability. But the options are a bit tricky. Option C says the court would not relieve because of the exception. But that would mean the father is liable, which contradicts what I thought.

Wait, maybe I got it wrong. Let me think again. The main purpose exception is a defense for the surety. If the main purpose of the suretyship was to benefit the principal debtor, then the surety can avoid liability. So in this case, the main purpose was to help the son get the car. Therefore, the father can use the exception to avoid liability. But looking at the options, option C says "not relieve...because of the main purpose exception." That would mean the father is liable, which doesn't fit. So perhaps the correct answer is A, that the father is relieved because the car lot didn't sue the son first.

Wait, but the majority rule is that the surety must be sued last, unless the contract provides otherwise. So if the creditor didn't sue the son first, the surety can avoid liability. In this question, the car lot went directly to the father without suing the son. So under the "last resort" rule, the surety isn't liable unless the creditor first sues and exhausts the principal debtor's assets. So the father would be relieved because the car lot didn't sue the son first. That would make option A correct.

But then, the main purpose exception is a separate issue. So which applies here? The question is about the father's obligation under his promise. The main purpose exception is a way for the surety to get off the hook if the main reason was to benefit the principal. But also, the rule about suing the principal first is another way.

So the question is which rule applies. The father made a verbal promise, so perhaps the rule about suing the principal first applies, making option A correct. Alternatively, the main purpose exception would apply, making option C incorrect.

I'm a bit confused, but I think the more likely answer is C because the main purpose was to benefit the son, so the father isn't liable. But wait, the options for C say "not relieve," which would mean he is liable. That doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm mixing up the rules.

Wait, maybe the main purpose exception is not applicable here because the father's suretyship was to secure the loan for the son, which is the main purpose. So the father can't be held liable because the main purpose was to help the son. Therefore, the court would relieve the father. But the options don't have that. Option A says the father is relieved because the car lot didn't sue the son first. So that's another reason.

Alternatively, perhaps the main purpose exception doesn't apply, and the father is liable unless the creditor sues the son first. Since the creditor didn't, the father isn't liable. So the correct answer would be A.

Wait, but in some jurisdictions, the main purpose exception allows the surety to avoid liability regardless of whether the creditor sues the principal first. So if the main purpose was to benefit the son, the father isn't liable. So the court would relieve him, which would mean the answer is C if it says "not relieve," but that's conflicting.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that the main purpose exception applies, making the father not liable. So the correct answer would be C: not relieve because of the main purpose exception. But the option says "not relieve," which would mean the father is liable, which contradicts. Hmm.

Wait, no. The main purpose exception allows the surety to avoid liability if the primary purpose was to benefit the principal. So the father can avoid liability, meaning the court would relieve him. But the options don't have that. Looking again, option C says "not relieve...because of the main purpose exception." That would mean the father is liable, which is the opposite of what the exception allows. So perhaps option A is correct because the creditor didn't sue the son first.

I think the correct answer is A: relieve the father because the car lot didn't sue the son first.

The question revolves around whether the father is liable for his son's car payments under his promise to the finance manager. The key legal concepts are the "main purpose exception" and the "last resort rule." The main purpose exception allows a surety to avoid liability if the primary purpose of the suretyship was to benefit the principal debtor (the son). Here, the father's promise was to help the son secure the car, which aligns with the exception. Additionally, the last resort rule states that a surety is not liable unless the creditor first sues the principal debtor. Since the car lot did not sue the son first, the father's liability is further questioned. Considering these points, the court is likely to relieve the father of liability because the car lot failed to sue the son first.
