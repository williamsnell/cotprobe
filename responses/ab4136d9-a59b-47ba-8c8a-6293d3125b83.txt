Okay, so I have this economics question here about the relationships between different cost curves. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking which of the options A to J is true. Let me first recall what each of these cost terms means. 

Total Cost (TC) is the sum of all costs, both fixed and variable. Fixed Costs (TFC) are costs that don't change with the level of output, like rent or salaries. Variable Costs (TVC) change with output, such as raw materials or labor. Average Fixed Cost (AFC) is TFC divided by the quantity produced (Q), so AFC = TFC/Q. Average Variable Cost (AVC) is TVC/Q. Total Variable Cost is simply TVC, which is AVC multiplied by Q, so TVC = AVC * Q. 

Average Total Cost (ATC) is the total cost divided by quantity, so ATC = (TFC + TVC)/Q, which can also be written as ATC = AFC + AVC. 

Marginal Cost (MC) is the additional cost of producing one more unit, calculated as the change in TC over the change in Q. So MC = ΔTC/ΔQ. 

Now let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: TFC = AVC at all levels of output. Hmm, TFC is fixed and doesn't change with output. AVC, on the other hand, depends on the quantity produced. So unless AVC is also fixed, which isn't the case, this can't be true. So A is probably false.

Option B: AVC + AFC = TC. Let's see. AVC is TVC/Q, and AFC is TFC/Q. So adding them gives (TVC + TFC)/Q, which is TC/Q. That's ATC, not TC itself. So B is incorrect.

Option C: TFC = TC at all levels of output. TC is TFC + TVC. So unless TVC is zero, which would only happen at zero output, this isn't true. So C is false.

Option D: MC = AVC + AFC. MC is the derivative of TC with respect to Q. Since TC = TFC + TVC, TFC is constant, so MC is d(TVC)/dQ. TVC is AVC * Q, so d(TVC)/dQ is AVC plus any change in AVC as Q changes. Wait, no. Actually, AVC might not be constant. If AVC is increasing or decreasing, then MC could be more than AVC. For example, if AVC is rising, MC would be higher than AVC at that point. So D is not necessarily true. Maybe D is false.

Option E: AFC = TC - AVC. Let's test this. TC is TFC + TVC. Subtracting AVC (which is TVC/Q) from TC would give TFC + TVC - TVC/Q. That's not equal to AFC, which is TFC/Q. So E is incorrect.

Option F: ATC = TC - AFC. Let's see. ATC is (TFC + TVC)/Q. TC is TFC + TVC. If I subtract AFC (TFC/Q) from TC, I get TFC + TVC - TFC/Q. That's not the same as ATC, which is (TFC + TVC)/Q. So F is false.

Option G: MC = TC - TFC. TC is TFC + TVC, so TC - TFC is TVC, which is Total Variable Cost. But MC is the derivative of TVC, not TVC itself. So G is incorrect.

Option H: TC = (AVC + AFC) * Q. Let's compute (AVC + AFC) * Q. AVC is TVC/Q, AFC is TFC/Q. Adding them gives (TVC + TFC)/Q, which is ATC. So (AVC + AFC)*Q = (TVC + TFC) = TC. Yes, that's correct. So H seems true.

Option I: TC = MC * Q. TC is TFC + TVC. MC is the derivative of TVC, but TVC = MC * Q only if MC is constant, which it's not. So I is generally false.

Option J: AVC = TC - TFC. Let's see. TC is TFC + TVC. Subtracting TFC gives TVC, but AVC is TVC/Q. So J would mean AVC = TVC, which is only true if Q=1. So J is false.

So the correct answer seems to be option H.

The correct answer is H because TC equals (AVC + AFC) multiplied by Q.
