Okay, so I need to figure out what percentage of China's GDP was spent on the military in 2017. Hmm, I remember that China has been increasing its military spending over the years, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact figure for 2017.

Wait, let me think. I know that as of a few years ago, China's military expenditure was around 2% of GDP. But I also heard that it's been growing, maybe a bit higher than that. So if it's increasing, perhaps it went up a little after 2016 or 2015.

Looking at the options, A is 8%, which seems high. I don't think China's military spending is that high compared to other countries. The US is around 3-4%, so 8% for China would be way higher. That's probably not right.

Option B is 2%, which I thought was maybe the case a few years back. But since it's been increasing, maybe it's higher now. Option C is 4.5%, which is higher than the US, which doesn't sound right because China's economy is much bigger. Wait, no, the US spends more in absolute terms but maybe a lower percentage.

Option D is 10%, that's even higher. I don't think so. E is 3%, which could be possible. I've heard that China's military spending is around 3% of GDP, but I'm not certain about the exact year.

Option F is 1%, that's too low, I think. G is 6%, which is possible but I'm not sure. H is 12%, way too high. I is 15%, no way. J is 0.5%, that's even lower than 1%, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, I think the actual figure for 2017 was around 2% or slightly higher. Maybe I'm confusing it with another country. Alternatively, perhaps it's around 3-4%. Let me try to recall any reports. I think the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) has data on this. According to SIPRI, China's military expenditure as a percentage of GDP in 2017 was about 1.8% or so. Wait, but that's 2017. Or was it 2.2%?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused now. If 2017's figure was around 2%, then option B is 2%, and option E is 3%. Which one is closer?

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me think: in 2016, China's military spending was around 2%, and it increased to about 2.2% in 2017. So that would put it around 2.2%, which is closer to 2% than 3%. So the closest option would be A:8%, no that's too high, wait no, option A is 8%, which is way off.

Wait, options are A:8%, B:2%, C:4.5%, D:10%, E:3%, F:1%, G:6%, H:12%, I:15%, J:0.50%.

If the actual figure is about 2.2%, then the closest option is B:2%. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe it's higher. Another thought: China's military spending has been growing at around 6-7% per year, so from a few years back, maybe it's increased to around 3% of GDP.

Wait, but in 2017, I think the figure was around 2.2%, so option B is 2%, which is the closest. Alternatively, maybe it's 3%, which would be option E.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to recall any specific sources. I remember reading that in 2017, China's military expenditure was about 2.2% of GDP, which would make the closest answer B:2%. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's 3%, but I think 2% is more accurate.

Wait, maybe I should consider the actual data. Let me try to remember that in 2017, China's military spending was approximately 2.2% of its GDP. So the options given are A:8%, B:2%, C:4.5%, D:10%, E:3%, F:1%, G:6%, H:12%, I:15%, J:0.50%.

So if 2.2% is the figure, then the closest option is B:2%. Alternatively, if it's 2.5%, then maybe E:3% is closer. But I'm not sure. I think 2% is more accurate.

Wait, another angle: China's military spending as a percentage of GDP has been around 1.3% to 2.2% in recent years. So 2017 was at 2.2%, so the closest answer is B:2%. Therefore, the answer should be A:8%? No, wait, no. A is 8%, which is way too high.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: the options are A through J, and the correct answer is likely B:2% or E:3%. I think the correct answer is around 2%, so B is the correct choice.
