Alright, so I have this question about who set the world record for the mile race in 1886. The options are A through J, each with different names. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I should think about the time period. 1886 is pretty early in terms of recorded sports records, especially for the mile. I know that the mile has been a significant race in track and field for a long time, but I'm not sure who the top runners were back then.

Looking at the options:

A: C Lewis - I'm not sure who that is. Maybe a sprinter, but I don't recall from that era.

B: R Bannister - Wait, Roger Bannister is famous for breaking the four-minute mile in 1954, which is way after 1886. So he can't be the answer.

C: WG George - This name sounds familiar. I think WG George was a British runner from the late 19th century. He might have set some records around that time.

D: J DiMaggio - That's Joe DiMaggio, the baseball player. Definitely not a runner, so not the answer.

E: U Bolt - Usain Bolt is a recent sprinter, famous for his 100m and 200m world records, so no.

F: S Coe - Steve Coe was a middle-distance runner in the 1970s and 80s, so much later than 1886.

G: J Owens - Jesse Owens was a sprinter and jumper from the early 20th century, known for his 1936 Olympics, so not 1886.

H: D Thompson - Don Thompson, not sure. Maybe a name from the early 20th century, but not sure about 1886.

I: M Johnson - Michael Johnson is a famous sprinter from the 90s, so no.

J: H El Guerrouj - He's a more recent runner, late 20th century, so not right.

So narrowing it down, the only one who fits the time frame is option C: WG George. I think he was a notable runner in the late 1800s. Let me double-check in my mind. Yes,WG George set several records in the 1880s, including the mile. I believe he was the first to break the four-minute mile? Wait, no, Roger Bannister did that in 1954. So maybe the time was slower back then. But regardless, WG George is associated with setting records in the 1880s, so he must be the one.

The correct answer is C: WG George, as he was a notable runner in the late 19th century and set records around that time.
