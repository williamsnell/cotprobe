Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. The question is about the impact of a change in government spending on real output in the short run. The options are A through G, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that government spending is a component of aggregate demand. When the government increases spending, it directly affects output. But the question is about the short run, so I should think about the factors that amplify or diminish this effect.

The options given are A to G. Let's go through each one.

Option A: The fiscal policy is expansionary. Well, expansionary fiscal policy involves increasing government spending or cutting taxes to stimulate the economy. So if the policy is expansionary, a change in spending would naturally have a bigger impact. But wait, the question is about when the impact is greater, not just whether it's expansionary. So maybe A is relevant, but I need to see the others.

Option B: The velocity of money is lower. Velocity refers to how quickly money circulates in the economy. If velocity is lower, each dollar isn't being used as much, which might affect the money supply's impact. But I'm not sure how this directly ties to government spending's effect on output. Maybe it's more about the money market and inflation than the direct multiplier effect of spending.

Option C: The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is lower. MPC is the fraction of additional income that people spend. If MPC is lower, people save more and spend less. If government spending increases, but people save more, the multiplier effect might be smaller. So a lower MPC would mean the impact of government spending is less, not greater. So maybe this isn't the right option.

Option D: The marginal propensity to consume is larger. A higher MPC means people spend more of any additional income. So when the government spends, the initial increase leads to more consumption, which further boosts output. This would make the multiplier effect larger, so the impact is greater. That sounds like a good candidate.

Option E: The exchange rate is higher. A higher exchange rate makes a country's exports more expensive and imports cheaper. If the exchange rate goes up, exports might fall, leading to lower net exports. But how does that tie into the impact of government spending? If the country's exports are weaker, maybe the effect of government spending is less because the overall demand from abroad is down. So a higher exchange rate might reduce the impact, making E not the right answer.

Option F: The trade balance is negative. A negative trade balance means the country is importing more than it exports. If the trade balance is negative, an increase in government spending might not have as much of an impact because part of the demand is leaking out through imports. So the multiplier effect could be smaller. But I'm not entirely sure about this one.

Option G: The inflation rate is higher. High inflation can erode purchasing power, but how does that affect the impact of government spending? If inflation is high, the real value of money is decreasing, but I'm not certain how this directly affects the short-run impact of spending on output. It might influence prices more than output in the short run.

Putting it together, the question is about when the impact is greater. So the key factors are the size of the MPC and how much the spending leads to further rounds of spending. A higher MPC (option D) would mean each dollar of government spending leads to more consumption, thus a larger multiplier effect. So the impact on real output would be greater when MPC is larger.

I think option D is the correct answer.

The impact of a change in government spending on real output in the short run is greater when the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is larger. A higher MPC means that a larger fraction of additional income is spent, amplifying the multiplier effect and increasing the overall impact on output.

Answer: D
