Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the concentration of Cu²+ ions after some reaction. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem says that 0.1 moles of Cu(NO3)2 are added to 1.0 moles of NH3, and then diluted to 1000 mL. I need to find the concentration of Cu²+ formed, given that the equilibrium constant K_eq is 8.5 × 10^-13.

Hmm, I remember that Cu²+ ions can form complexes with ammonia. The reaction should be something like Cu²+ + NH3 ↔ Cu(NH3)₂²+. Wait, no, maybe it's a different stoichiometry. Oh right, the formation of the complex is typically Cu²+ + 4NH3 ↔ [Cu(NH3)4]^2+. So that's the correct reaction.

So the reaction is Cu²+ + 4NH3 ⇌ [Cu(NH3)4]^2+. The K_eq given would be for this formation constant. So K_eq = [Cu(NH3)4^2+]/([Cu²+][NH3]^4).

Now, let's think about the initial moles. I have 0.1 moles of Cu(NO3)2. Since each mole of Cu(NO3)2 gives one mole of Cu²+ ions, that's 0.1 moles of Cu²+.

And I have 1.0 moles of NH3. The volume is 1000 mL, which is 1 L, so concentrations initially would be [Cu²+] = 0.1 M and [NH3] = 1.0 M.

But wait, when the reaction happens, the Cu²+ will react with NH3 to form the complex. Let's let the change be 'x'. So, at equilibrium, [Cu²+] will be 0.1 - x, [NH3] will be 1.0 - 4x, and [Cu(NH3)4^2+] will be x.

But wait, I'm not sure about the stoichiometry. Since each complex requires four NH3 molecules per Cu²+, when x moles of Cu²+ react, each uses 4x moles of NH3. So the change makes sense.

So, the expression for K_eq is x / [(0.1 - x)(1.0 - 4x)^4] = 8.5e-13.

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can assume that x is very small compared to 0.1 and 1.0, so 0.1 - x ≈ 0.1 and 1.0 -4x ≈ 1.0. Let me check if that's a valid assumption.

Given that K_eq is very small (1e-13), the reaction doesn't proceed much, so x should be tiny. So maybe I can approximate (0.1 - x) ≈ 0.1 and (1.0 -4x) ≈ 1.0.

So the equation simplifies to x / [0.1 * (1)^4] = 8.5e-13 → x = 8.5e-13 * 0.1 → x = 8.5e-14.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check. Wait, 8.5e-13 * 0.1 is 8.5e-14. So x is 8.5e-14.

But wait, I think I messed up the initial setup. Because the K_eq expression is [complex]/([Cu²+][NH3]^4). So the initial concentrations before reaction are [Cu²+] = 0.1 M, [NH3] = 1.0 M, and [complex] = 0.

At equilibrium, [Cu²+] = 0.1 - x, [NH3] = 1.0 -4x, and [complex] = x.

So the K_eq expression is x / [(0.1 - x)(1.0 -4x)^4] = 8.5e-13.

But if x is really small, then 0.1 - x ≈ 0.1 and 1.0 -4x ≈1.0. So K_eq ≈ x / (0.1 * 1) → x ≈ K_eq * 0.1 = 8.5e-13 * 0.1 = 8.5e-14.

Wait, but wait, that would make x ≈ 8.5e-14. That's really small, so the approximation holds.

Therefore, the concentration of Cu²+ at equilibrium is (0.1 - x) ≈ 0.1 M, but wait, no, because x is the amount that reacted, so the remaining Cu²+ is 0.1 - x ≈ 0.1 - 8.5e-14 ≈ 0.1 M.

Wait, that can't be right because K_eq is so small, meaning the reaction doesn't go far, so most Cu²+ remains unreacted. So the concentration of free Cu²+ should be close to 0.1 M, but perhaps a bit lower.

Wait, but in that case, why is the answer not 0.1 M? Because the options have I as 0.1 M, which would be the case if Cu²+ doesn't react much.

But wait, let me think again. The K_eq is for the formation of the complex. So a low K_eq means that the complex doesn't form much, so most of the Cu²+ remains as free ions. So yes, [Cu²+] is almost 0.1 M.

Wait, but wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of Cu²+ formed. Wait, that's a bit ambiguous. Perhaps it's asking about the free Cu²+ concentration after the reaction.

Alternatively, if the problem is about the concentration of Cu²+ that remains uncomplexed, then it would be approximately 0.1 M, which is option I. But that seems too straightforward.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are A:8.5e-2, B:5e-2, C:1.0, D:8.5e-13, E:1.7e-13, F:0.05, G:3e-13, H:6.5e-13, I:0.1, J:2e-13.

So option I is 0.1 M. But wait, why would the concentration of Cu²+ be the same as the initial concentration if some of it forms a complex? Because some of it does form a complex, so the free [Cu²+] should be less than 0.1 M. So my initial thought that x is 8.5e-14 would suggest that [Cu²+] is 0.1 - 8.5e-14 ≈ 0.1 M, but that's only if x is negligible.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me re-express the K_eq correctly.

K_eq = [Cu(NH3)4^2+]/([Cu²+][NH3]^4) = 8.5e-13.

Assuming x is small, [Cu(NH3)4^2+] ≈ x, [Cu²+] ≈ 0.1, [NH3] ≈1.0.

So substituting, x/(0.1 *1) =8.5e-13 → x=8.5e-14.

So [Cu²+] is 0.1 - x ≈ 0.1 M. But wait, that can't be right because if all the Cu²+ stays as free ions, the concentration would be 0.1 M. But some does form the complex, so the free [Cu²+] is 0.1 - x, which is just a tiny bit less than 0.1. However, in terms of significant figures, maybe it's considered as 0.1 M.

Looking at the options, that would be option I: 0.1 M.

But wait, another thought. Maybe the problem is considering that all the Cu²+ forms the complex, but that doesn't make sense because with such a low K_eq, the reaction doesn't proceed much. So the free [Cu²+] remains almost the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach was wrong. Another approach: the formation of the complex is Cu²+ + 4NH3 → [Cu(NH3)4]^2+.

The initial moles: Cu²+ is 0.1 mol, NH3 is 1.0 mol. Volume is 1 L, so concentrations are 0.1 M and 1.0 M.

The reaction will proceed until equilibrium. Let x be the amount of Cu²+ that reacts.

At equilibrium:
[Cu²+] = 0.1 - x
[NH3] = 1.0 -4x
[complex] = x

So the K_eq expression is x / [ (0.1 - x) (1.0 -4x)^4 ] = 8.5e-13.

Assuming x is very small, 0.1 - x ≈0.1, 1.0 -4x ≈1.0.

So x ≈8.5e-13 * 0.1 *1 → x≈8.5e-14.

So [Cu²+] =0.1 -8.5e-14 ≈0.1 M.

Thus, the concentration of Cu²+ is approximately 0.1 M, which is option I.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 8.5e-13 M, which is the K_eq. So why isn't that the answer? Because K_eq is the equilibrium constant, not the concentration of Cu²+.

So my conclusion is that the concentration of Cu²+ is approximately 0.1 M, so option I is correct.

The problem involves determining the concentration of free Cu²+ ions after the reaction between Cu(NO₃)₂ and NH₃, given the equilibrium constant \( K_{\text{eq}} = 8.5 \times 10^{-13} \). The reaction is:

\[
\text{Cu}^{2+} + 4\text{NH}_3 \leftrightarrow [\text{Cu(NH}_3\text{)}_4]^{2+}
\]

Initially, 0.1 moles of Cu(NO₃)₂ provide 0.1 moles of Cu²+, and 1.0 moles of NH₃ are present in 1000 mL (1 L). Thus, the initial concentrations are \([\text{Cu}^{2+}] = 0.1 \, \text{M}\) and \([\text{NH}_3] = 1.0 \, \text{M}\).

Let \( x \) represent the moles of Cu²+ that react to form the complex \([\text{Cu(NH}_3\text{)}_4]^{2+}\). At equilibrium:

\[
[\text{Cu}^{2+}] = 0.1 - x, \quad [\text{NH}_3] = 1.0 - 4x, \quad [\text{Cu(NH}_3\text{)}_4^{2+}] = x
\]

The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_{\text{eq}} = \frac{[\text{Cu(NH}_3\text{)}_4^{2+}]}{[\text{Cu}^{2+}][\text{NH}_3]^4} = \frac{x}{(0.1 - x)(1.0 - 4x)^4}
\]

Given the small value of \( K_{\text{eq}} \), the reaction does not proceed far, so \( x \) is very small. Approximating \( 0.1 - x \approx 0.1 \) and \( 1.0 - 4x \approx 1.0 \), the expression simplifies to:

\[
K_{\text{eq}} \approx \frac{x}{0.1 \cdot 1.0^4} \implies x = K_{\text{eq}} \cdot 0.1 = (8.5 \times 10^{-13}) \cdot 0.1 = 8.5 \times 10^{-14}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free \(\text{Cu}^{2+}\) is:

\[
[\text{Cu}^{2+}] = 0.1 - x \approx 0.1 - 8.5 \times 10^{-14} \approx 0.1 \, \text{M}
\]

Since \( x \) is negligible, the concentration of free \(\text{Cu}^{2+}\) remains approximately \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**I: 0.1 M**
