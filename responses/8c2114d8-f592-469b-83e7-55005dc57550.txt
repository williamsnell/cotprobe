Okay, so I'm trying to solve this FORTRAN programming question. The task is to compute the arithmetic mean of N real numbers that have been read into an array X. The options are labeled A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I'll read the question again carefully. The goal is to find the correct FORTRAN code that calculates the arithmetic mean. So, I need to look for a program that does the following steps:

1. Reads N, the number of real numbers.
2. Reads the N numbers into an array X.
3. Sums all the elements in X.
4. Divides the sum by N to get the average.
5. Outputs the average.

Now, I'll go through each option one by one to see which one does this correctly.

Option A:
- DIMENSION X(N) — declares an array of size N, which is correct.
- SUM = 0.0 — initializes sum correctly.
- READ (5,20) N, (X(I), I=1,N) — reads N and the X values. That's good.
- DO 50 I = 1,N — loop from 1 to N.
- 5\OSUM = SUM + X(N-I+1) — wait, this adds X in reverse order. For example, when I=1, it adds X(N), I=2 adds X(N-1), etc. This would sum the elements, but why reverse? It doesn't affect the sum, just the order. So it's correct in summing all elements but adds them in reverse order. But since addition is commutative, the sum is the same. So this part is fine.
- Then compute AVG = SUM / FLOAT(N). That's correct.
- So, this option seems to compute the sum correctly, but it's adding from the end to the beginning. But the arithmetic mean doesn't depend on the order, so this would give the right average. So maybe this is correct, but let's check others.

Option B:
- DIMENSION X(1:N) — correct.
- SUM = 0.0 — correct.
- READ (5,20) N — reads N.
- Then, in a loop from I=1 to N, it reads X(I) and adds to SUM. Wait, but the READ statement only reads N, not the X's. Oh wait, the code after the read is a FOR loop that adds each X(I). But how are the X's read? The initial read only reads N. So in this case, the X's are not read correctly. Because the first READ only gets N, and the X's aren't read until the loop. But in FORTRAN, you can't read into an array unless you specify it. So in option B, after reading N, the code loops and adds X(I), but X hasn't been filled. So this code is incorrect because it doesn't read the X values properly. So B is wrong.

Option C:
- DIMENSION X(N) — correct.
- SUM = 0.0 — correct.
- READ (5,20) N — reads N.
- Then, 2\OFORMAT (2X,I5) — this is a format statement, but it's not clear where it's used. It might be for output, but the code then loops I=1 to N and adds I to SUM. Wait, that's summing the indices, not the X values. So this would compute the sum of 1+2+...+N, not the actual X values. So this is definitely wrong.

Option D:
- DIMENSION X(N) — correct.
- SUM = 0.0 — correct.
- READ (5,20) (X(I), I=1,N) — reads all X values correctly.
- Then, a DO loop from I=1 to N, adding X(I) to SUM. So summing correctly.
- AVG = SUM / FLOAT(N) — correct, as dividing by N as a float to get a real number.
- So this seems correct. But wait, let's check the other parts. The code doesn't have a print statement, but the question doesn't specify output, just compute the mean. So D is a good candidate.

Option E:
- DIMENSION X(N) — correct.
- SUM = 0.0 — correct.
- READ (5,20) N — reads N.
- 2\OFORMAT (2X,I5) — same as C, perhaps for output.
- Then, loop adding X(I), but the loop adds SUM = SUM - X(I). That's subtraction, which would make the sum negative if all X are positive. So this is incorrect.

Option F:
- DIMENSION X(N) — correct.
- SUM = 0.0 — correct.
- READ (5,20) N — reads N.
- Then, 2\OFORMAT (2X,I5) — perhaps for output formatting.
- Loop adds X(I) to SUM correctly.
- AVG = SUM / FLOAT(N) — correct.
- So F is similar to D, but does it read the X values correctly? In D, the READ statement reads N and the X's together. In F, the initial read only reads N, then in the loop, does it read X's? Wait, no. Looking at F's code: after reading N, it doesn't read the X's. The loop simply adds to SUM, but if X hasn't been read, those values are undefined (garbage). So F is incorrect because it doesn't read the X array.

Wait, no. Let me check F again. The code after SUM=0.0 is:

READ (5,20) N — reads N.
Then, 2\OFORMAT (2X,I5) — perhaps for output.
Then, DO loop from I=1 to N, adding X(I) to SUM.

But the X array wasn't read after N. So in F, the X array is not filled because the code only reads N, not the X's. So F is incorrect because X isn't read. So D is better than F because D reads the X's correctly.

Option G:
- SUM is initialized to 1.0 — that's wrong because the sum should start at 0, not 1. So this would add 1 to all the X's, making the average incorrect.

Option H:
- Sums the squares of X(I), then takes the square root of the sum divided by N. That's computing the root mean square, not the arithmetic mean. So H is incorrect.

Option I:
- Uses SUM / INT(N) — which converts N to integer, but if N is larger than what integer can hold, or if the division should be floating point, this could cause issues. Also, in FORTRAN, using INT(N) when N is already an integer might be redundant but not necessarily wrong. However, the main issue is whether the code correctly sums the X's. In I, the code reads N, then in the loop, adds X(I) to SUM. But the initial read is only N, so X hasn't been filled. So I is incorrect because the X array isn't read properly.

Option J:
- The first statement after SUM is WRITE (5,20) N — which writes N to unit 5. But the problem says the numbers have already been read into X, so perhaps this is incorrect. Also, the code then reads using 2\OFORMAT, but I'm not sure. Then, in the loop, it adds X(I) to SUM. But the initial read (after writing) is unclear. It seems like J might not be reading the X array correctly because it writes N and then perhaps doesn't read the X's properly. Plus, the WRITE might not be necessary here.

So, going back, the correct approach is:

- Read N and the X array in one read statement.
- Sum all X(I) from I=1 to N.
- Divide the sum by N as a real number.

Looking at the options, D does this correctly.

Wait, let me check D again.

Option D:
- DIMENSION X(N)
- SUM = 0.0
- READ (5,20) (X(I), I=1,N) — this reads N numbers into X(1) to X(N). Correct.
- DO loop adds each X(I) to SUM. Correct.
- AVG = SUM / FLOAT(N) — correct, because using FLOAT ensures division is floating point.
- No print statement, but the question only asks to compute the mean, not output it. So D is correct.

Option A, while summing in reverse, is still correct because the sum is the same. So why isn't A correct? Because it's reading N and the X's in the same read statement, but in the loop, it's adding X(N-I+1). Let me see:

For I=1: X(N)
I=2: X(N-1)
...
I=N: X(1)

So the sum is the same as adding from X(1) to X(N). So the sum is correct. So why isn't A correct? Because the code in A uses X(N-I+1), which effectively reverses the order of addition. But since sum is commutative, the total sum is correct. So A would compute the correct average.

Wait, but in the code, the first read statement in A is READ (5,20) N, (X(I), I=1,N). So that correctly reads N and then the X's. Then, the loop adds X(N-I+1). So the sum is correct. So why isn't A correct? Because the question is about the arithmetic mean, which doesn't depend on the order. So A would compute the correct average.

But wait, in the code, after the sum is computed, it's assigned to AVG as SUM / FLOAT(N). That's correct.

So both A and D seem correct, but looking at their code:

In D, the loop is adding X(I) in the correct order, while in A, it's adding in reverse. But both sum all elements, so both compute the correct average.

Wait, but the code in A has a DO 50 I=1,N, and the statement is 5\OSUM = SUM + X(N-I+1). So the sum is correct. So why is D correct and A not? Because the question is about which code is correct, and both A and D seem correct. But perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option A's code:

SUM = 0.0
READ (5,20) N, (X(I), I=1,N)
DO 50 I = 1,N
5\OSUM = SUM + X(N-I+1)
AVG = SUM/FLOAT (N)
STOP
END

Yes, this reads N and X correctly. Then, in the loop, it adds X(N), X(N-1), ..., X(1). That's correct.

Option D's code:

SUM = 0.0
READ (5,20) (X(I), I=1,N)
DO 50 I = 1,N
5\OSUM = SUM + X(I)
AVG = SUM/FLOAT (N)
STOP
END

So both A and D seem correct. But wait, the question is which one is the correct program. So why are both A and D correct? That can't be, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I overlooked something. In option A, the read statement is (5,20) N, (X(I), I=1,N). But in FORTRAN, the first number in the input must be N, followed by N numbers. So reading N and then the X's is correct.

But in the loop, it's adding X(N-I+1), which is correct because I runs from 1 to N, so N-I+1 runs from N down to 1. So the sum is correct.

In option D, the read statement is (X(I), I=1,N), which implies that the input only contains the X's, but how is N read? Because in D's code, the first read statement is:

READ (5,20) (X(I), I=1,N)

But where is N coming from? Wait, in D, the code is:

SUM = 0.0
READ (5,20) (X(I), I=1,N)

But in this case, the first READ statement is trying to read (X(I), I=1,N), but N hasn't been read yet. Because the program hasn't read N before this statement. So in D, the code is incorrect because it's trying to read N numbers into X, but N hasn't been read yet. Because in D, the first statement after SUM is the read of X, but N hasn't been read. So D is wrong because it doesn't read N first.

Wait, that's a critical point. So in D, the code doesn't read N before reading the X's. So when it does READ (5,20) (X(I), I=1,N), it's trying to read N elements, but N hasn't been set yet. So this is a syntax or runtime error because N is undefined at that point.

So that makes D incorrect. Then, option A is correct because it reads N first, then the X's.

Wait, but in option A, the first read is:

READ (5,20) N, (X(I), I=1,N)

Which correctly reads N and then the X's. So A is correct.

So I think I made a mistake earlier. Option A is correct because it reads N and the X's correctly. Option D is incorrect because it tries to read X's without knowing N first.

So the correct answer is A.

Wait, but earlier I thought D was correct, but now I'm seeing that D doesn't read N before reading X's, which is a problem. So D is incorrect.

So the correct option is A.
</think>

The correct answer is **A**. 

**Explanation:**

- **Option A** correctly reads the value of `N` and the array `X` in a single `READ` statement. The loop then sums the elements of `X` in reverse order, which does not affect the sum's correctness. Finally, the average is computed correctly.

- **Option D** is incorrect because it attempts to read the array `X` before `N` has been read, leading to a runtime error.

Thus, the correct program is provided in **Option A**.
