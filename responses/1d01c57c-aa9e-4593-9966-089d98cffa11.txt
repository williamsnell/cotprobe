Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question. The question is about what happens when the economy is operating beyond full employment. I remember that full employment is when the economy is at its natural level, so if it's beyond that, it's probably in a situation where demand is exceeding supply. 

The options given are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says the government should increase aggregate demand. Wait, if the economy is beyond full employment, that means it's in a boom period, possibly causing inflation. So increasing aggregate demand would make things worse, right? So A is probably not correct.

Option B: The short-run aggregate supply curve is horizontal. I think the SRAS curve is horizontal at full employment because beyond that, it becomes upward sloping. Hmm, I'm not too sure. Wait, no, when the economy is at full employment, the SRAS is vertical because any increase in demand would lead to higher prices, not more output. So B might be incorrect.

Option C: Further increases in AD will decrease inflation. But if the economy is already beyond full employment, increasing AD would cause inflation to rise, not decrease. So C is wrong.

Option D: Further increases in AD won't lower unemployment but will create inflation. Wait, if we're beyond full employment, unemployment is already at its natural rate. So increasing AD would lead to more inflation but not lower unemployment. So D seems correct.

Option E: The economy will return to full employment without intervention. No, if it's beyond full employment, the economy might overheat and cause inflation. Without intervention, it might not correct itself quickly. So E is probably wrong.

Option F: A decrease in AD will result in a lower price level if prices are sticky. If prices are sticky, a decrease in AD would lower the price level, yes. But this option is about when the economy is beyond full employment. I'm not sure if this directly answers the question, which is about what's true at that point.

Option G: The SRAS curve is vertical. I think this is the case when the economy is at full employment because beyond that, the SRAS becomes vertical, meaning no increase in output, only prices. So G might be correct.

Option H: The economy is at risk of entering a recession. If it's beyond full employment, it's more about inflation, not recession. Recession is when output is below full employment. So H is probably incorrect.

Option I: Further increases in AD will lower the price level. No, because if you're beyond full employment, increasing AD would push up prices. So I is wrong.

Option J: A decrease in AD will lead to higher price level. That doesn't make sense because decreasing AD should lower the price level, not increase it. So J is wrong.

Now, between options D and G. The question is about the situation when the economy is beyond full employment. The SRAS curve beyond full employment is vertical, so G says that, which is correct. But D is also correct in the sense that increasing AD beyond full employment doesn't lower unemployment, which is already at the natural rate, but causes inflation.

Wait, but the options are about what's true at that point. So if the economy is beyond full employment, the SRAS is vertical, so G is correct. Also, D says further increases in AD won't lower unemployment but cause inflation, which is also correct. So both D and G seem correct, but I need to see which is an accurate statement.

Wait, the options are about what is true when the economy is beyond full employment. So the correct statements would be either G or D.

I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. When the economy is at full employment, the SRAS is vertical because any increase in AD can only raise prices, not output. So if it's beyond full employment, it's in a region where the SRAS is vertical, so G is correct.

Also, at that point, increasing AD further won't lower unemployment because it's already at the natural rate, so D is correct as well.

Wait, but the options are separate. So both D and G could be correct, but looking at the options, the question is which one is true.

Wait, the question says "which of the following is true at this point."

So both D and G are correct? Or am I making a mistake here.

Wait, no. At full employment, the SRAS is vertical. Beyond that, it's in a region where the SRAS is vertical, so G is correct. So G is true.

But D is also correct because beyond full employment, increasing AD won't lower unemployment but will cause inflation.

Hmm, but looking back at the options, the answer is probably G because that's a characteristic of the SRAS curve when the economy is beyond full employment.

Wait, but the options are separate. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: Government should increase AD.

B: SRAS is horizontal.

C: Further AD increases will decrease inflation.

D: Further AD increases won't lower unemployment but will create inflation.

E: Economy will return without intervention.

F: Decrease AD will lower price level if prices are sticky.

G: SRAS is vertical.

H: Economy is at risk of recession.

I: Further AD increases lower price level.

J: Decrease AD leads to higher price level.

So both D and G seem correct. But I need to pick the correct answer.

Wait, no, in reality, when the economy is beyond full employment, the SRAS is vertical, so G is correct. Also, any increase in AD would cause inflation without affecting unemployment, so D is correct.

But looking at the options, perhaps both D and G are correct, but the question is which is true.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is G, because the SRAS being vertical is a correct statement when the economy is beyond full employment.

Alternatively, D is also correct because it's a consequence of increasing AD beyond full employment.

But the question is about what is true at that point, so both G and D could be correct. But looking at the options, the answer is likely G because it's a direct characteristic of the SRAS curve in that scenario.

Wait, but let me think again. When the economy is at full employment, the SRAS is vertical. If it's operating beyond full employment, it's because of excess demand, so the SRAS is vertical. So G is correct.

Therefore, the answer should be G. But wait, I'm a bit confused because in my initial analysis, D also seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps D is correct because when the economy is beyond full employment, increasing AD leads to higher inflation but doesn't change unemployment. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is about what is true when the economy is beyond full employment. So both G and D are correct? Or is only one correct.

Wait, looking at the options, the correct answer is G. Because the SRAS is vertical when the economy is at or beyond full employment.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps D is correct because it states the effect of increasing AD beyond full employment.

But I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again.

If the economy is beyond full employment, the SRAS is vertical, so G is correct. Also, any further increases in AD would cause inflation but not lower unemployment, so D is correct.

So both D and G would be correct. But since the options are separate, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but the question is which is true at that point. So both G and D are correct. But looking at the options, perhaps both can't be selected, so I must choose the best option.

Wait, the options are from A to J, and only one is correct.

So I need to choose between D and G.

In the context of the question, when the economy is beyond full employment, the SRAS is vertical, so G is correct. Also, increasing AD would cause inflation without affecting unemployment, so D is also correct.

But perhaps the correct answer is G because it's a direct characteristic of the SRAS.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is D because it's the consequence of increasing AD beyond full employment.

Wait, but the question is asking what is true at that point, not what should be done or what will happen. So perhaps G is correct because it's a factual statement about the SRAS curve.

But I'm not entirely certain. Maybe I should look for more clues.

If the economy is beyond full employment, it's in a region where the SRAS is vertical. So G is correct.

So I think the correct answer is G.

The economy is operating beyond full employment, meaning it is in a boom period where demand exceeds supply. In this scenario, the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve becomes vertical because any further increases in aggregate demand (AD) will only lead to higher prices, not more output. Additionally, increasing AD beyond full employment will not lower the unemployment rate, as it is already at the natural rate, but will instead cause inflation. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect, as increasing AD would worsen inflation.
- **B**: Incorrect, as the SRAS is vertical, not horizontal, beyond full employment.
- **C**: Incorrect, as increasing AD will raise, not lower, inflation.
- **D**: Correct, as further increases in AD will not lower unemployment but will create inflation.
- **E**: Incorrect, as the economy will not naturally return to full employment without intervention.
- **F**: Incorrect, as decreasing AD would lower the price level if prices are sticky, but this does not directly address the situation.
- **G**: Correct, as the SRAS is vertical beyond full employment.
- **H**: Incorrect, as the economy is not at risk of recession; it is at risk of inflation.
- **I**: Incorrect, as increasing AD will raise, not lower, the price level.
- **J**: Incorrect, as decreasing AD will lower, not raise, the price level.

Both **D** and **G** are correct statements, but the question asks for what is true at this point. The SRAS being vertical (G) is a direct characteristic of the economy beyond full employment. Therefore, the correct answer is:

G
