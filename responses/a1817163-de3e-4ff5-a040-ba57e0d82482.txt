Okay, so I have this question about Erikson's stages of psychosocial development. I remember that Erikson developed a theory that builds on Freud's but focuses more on social aspects. He talked about different stages that people go through, each with their own crisis or challenge.

Let me think. I recall that each stage is a conflict between two things, like a positive and negative outcome. For example, the first stage is about trust versus mistrust. If an infant is well taken care of, they develop trust; otherwise, mistrust. That sounds right.

Then the next stages... I think the second one is autonomy versus shame and doubt. So that's toddlers learning to do things on their own, like potty training. If they're encouraged, they gain autonomy; if not, they feel shame.

The third stage, I believe, is initiative versus guilt. Preschoolers start exploring and doing things like pretend play. If they're supported, they feel good about being initiative, but if they're restricted, they might feel guilty.

Moving on, the fourth stage is industry versus inferiority. School-age kids learn skills and if they feel competent, they develop a sense of industry. If they struggle, they might feel inferior.

Fifth stage is identity versus role confusion. Adolescents are trying to figure out who they are. If they can explore and get support, they form a strong identity. Otherwise, they might feel confused.

Next, intimacy versus isolation. Young adults in their late teens to early twenties form intimate relationships. Success leads to strong relationships, failure can lead to isolation.

Then generativity versus stagnation. Middle-aged people focus on contributing to society, maybe through work or family. If they don't feel they're contributing, they might feel stagnant.

Lastly, the eighth stage is ego integrity versus despair. Older adults reflect on their lives. If they feel they've led a fulfilling life, they achieve integrity. If not, they might feel despair.

Looking at the options, option C lists these stages correctly: trust vs mistrust, autonomy vs shame, initiative vs guilt, industry vs inferiority, identity vs role confusion, intimacy vs isolation, generativity vs stagnation, and ego integrity vs despair.

Option A seems to have different terms, like survival vs extinction, which doesn't match what I remember. Option B lists stages by name but doesn't use the conflict terms. Option D is more about age stages without the specific conflicts. Option F has some similar terms but not exactly matching. So I'm confident that option C is correct.

The correct answer is C, as it accurately lists Erikson's stages with their corresponding psychosocial conflicts.
