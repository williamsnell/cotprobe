Okay, so I have this chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out. The question is about substances whose Lewis structures must be drawn with an unpaired electron. Hmm, I remember that Lewis structures are those diagrams showing how electrons are arranged around atoms, right? So the key here is unpaired electrons.

Let me think about each option. The options are from A to J, with various terms. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Hydrogen bonds. I know hydrogen bonds are a type of intermolecular force, stronger than van der Waals but weaker than covalent bonds. They form when a hydrogen atom is bonded to a highly electronegative atom like O, N, or F. But hydrogen bonds themselves aren't about unpaired electrons in Lewis structures. So probably not A.

Option B: Free radicals. Free radicals are species with unpaired electrons. They're usually very reactive. In Lewis structures, free radicals would have an unpaired electron. So this seems relevant. I'll keep this in mind.

Option C: Allotropes. Allotropes are different structural forms of the same element in the same physical state, like how carbon has graphite, diamond, and graphene. But they're about structure, not necessarily unpaired electrons. So probably not C.

Option D: Isotopes. Isotopes are variants of the same element with different numbers of neutrons. They don't affect Lewis structures because they don't change the electron count. So D is out.

Option E: Nonpolar molecules. Nonpolar molecules have no net dipole moment because their dipoles cancel out. But that's about symmetry, not necessarily unpaired electrons. So E isn't the answer.

Option F: Polar molecules. Similar to E, but these do have a net dipole moment. Again, the presence of unpaired electrons isn't the defining factor here. So F is unlikely.

Option G: Covalent compounds. Covalent compounds are those held together by covalent bonds. Lewis structures are used for covalent compounds, but not all of them have unpaired electrons. So G doesn't fit.

Option H: Resonance structures. These are different ways to represent the Lewis structure of a molecule, showing equivalent structures due to delocalized electrons. But resonance structures themselves don't require unpaired electrons. So H is not it.

Option I: Dipole moments. Dipole moments are about the separation of charge in a molecule. They arise from differences in electronegativity, but not directly from unpaired electrons. So I think I can rule out I.

Option J: Ionic compounds. These are compounds with ions, so they form through the transfer of electrons. Lewis structures for ionic compounds usually show the ions, but I'm not sure if they require unpaired electrons. Wait, in ionic structures, the ions are octet-satisfying, so maybe they don't have unpaired electrons. Or do they? For example, O^2- has a full octet, but maybe some transition metal ions might have unpaired electrons. But generally, Lewis structures for ionic compounds might not necessarily have unpaired electrons. So J might not be the right choice.

Wait, but the question says "must be drawn with an unpaired electron." So which of these substances require an unpaired electron in their Lewis structure.

Free radicals (B) definitely have unpaired electrons. For example, O., which is an oxygen atom with a single bond or something, has an unpaired electron.

Other possibilities: Some molecules have unpaired electrons due to their valence structure. For example, O2 has two unpaired electrons in its ground state. So when you draw the Lewis structure for O2, it would show unpaired electrons because of the double bond and the lone pairs. But that's specific. So the question is about substances that must have unpaired electrons in their Lewis structures.

So the only option that fits is B: free radicals. Because free radicals are defined by having at least one unpaired electron, which would show up in their Lewis structures.

The question asks about substances whose Lewis structures must include an unpaired electron. Lewis structures represent the arrangement of electrons around atoms, and the presence of unpaired electrons is significant in certain cases.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Hydrogen bonds** are intermolecular forces, not related to unpaired electrons in Lewis structures.  
- **B: Free radicals** are species with unpaired electrons, which must be shown in their Lewis structures.  
- **C: Allotropes** refer to structural forms of an element, not specifically to unpaired electrons.  
- **D: Isotopes** are variants of an element with different neutrons, unrelated to electron arrangement in Lewis structures.  
- **E: Nonpolar molecules** lack a net dipole moment due to symmetry, not necessarily unpaired electrons.  
- **F: Polar molecules** have a net dipole moment, but this doesn't require unpaired electrons.  
- **G: Covalent compounds** are bonded by covalent bonds, but not all have unpaired electrons.  
- **H: Resonance structures** show equivalent electron arrangements, not necessarily unpaired electrons.  
- **I: Dipole moments** relate to charge separation, not unpaired electrons.  
- **J: Ionic compounds** involve ions, which typically have satisfied octets, so unpaired electrons are not a requirement.

The only option that fits is **B: free radicals**, as they are defined by having unpaired electrons, which must be represented in their Lewis structures.
