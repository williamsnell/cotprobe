Okay, so I've got this problem about a transformer, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking.

The transformer is 10 kVA, which means its capacity is 10 kilovolt-amperes. It's a single-phase transformer with a primary voltage of 2400 V and a secondary voltage of 240 V. The resistances and reactances are given: r1 is 3.00 Ω, r2 is 0.0300 Ω, x1 is 15.00 Ω, and x2 is 0.150 Ω. The question is asking for the primary voltage required to produce 240 V at the secondary terminals under full load conditions, but for two different power factors: (a) 0.8 lagging and (b) 0.8 leading.

Hmm, I remember that transformers have some losses due to their windings and reactances. The primary and secondary sides have resistances (r1 and r2) and reactances (x1 and x2). At full load, the current is maximum, so we need to consider the voltage drops in both the primary and secondary windings.

First, I should probably find the current in the secondary when it's delivering 240 V at full load. Since the transformer is operating at full load, the secondary current I2 can be calculated using the power formula. The power S is 10 kVA, so S = V * I, but since it's single-phase, the formula is straightforward.

Wait, but the secondary voltage is 240 V, and the load power factor is given. So the current I2 is S / (V2 * cosφ), where φ is the power factor angle. Wait, but actually, the load current is I2 = (S) / (V2), but that's when considering apparent power. But since the power factor is given, maybe I should use the real power. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of current with power factor.

Wait, the load is at the secondary side. So the current I2 is determined by the power delivered to the load. Full load means the transformer is delivering its rated power, which is 10 kVA. So the current I2 is S / V2. But wait, the power factor comes into play for the phase angle, not the magnitude of current. Because I = S / V is the magnitude, and the power factor affects the real power but not the current's magnitude. So, I think the magnitude of I2 is the same regardless of the power factor's leading or lagging, but the phase angle changes.

Wait no, that might not be correct. Because the power factor affects the load's current. Wait, let me clarify. The load's current is determined by the power it draws. The apparent power is S = V * I, so I = S / V. But the real power is P = S * cosφ. So the magnitude of current is the same for both power factors because it's based on apparent power.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if the power factor is 0.8 lagging, the load is inductive, so the current lags the voltage. If it's 0.8 leading, the load is capacitive, so the current leads the voltage. But the magnitude of the current is determined by S / V2, which is 10,000 VA / 240 V = approximately 41.666 A. So the magnitude of I2 is 41.666 A regardless of power factor. But the phase angle changes.

So, when calculating the voltage drop in the secondary winding, we'll have to consider the current and the secondary's impedance. The secondary impedance is r2 + jx2. Similarly, the primary impedance as seen from the primary side is r1 + jx1, but when the secondary is loaded, the primary current will depend on the secondary's current and the transformation ratio.

Wait, but the primary voltage V1 must account for the voltage drops in both the primary and secondary windings. So, the primary voltage V1 is equal to the induced EMF minus the primary voltage drop due to its resistance and reactance, plus the secondary voltage drop. Or wait, maybe it's better to model the transformer as a two-winding circuit with the load connected to the secondary.

I think I should model the transformer with the load connected. The secondary side has a load impedance. The load impedance Z_load is V2 / I2, but considering the power factor. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me slow down.

First, the transformer's primary and secondary windings have their own impedances. The primary impedance is Z1 = r1 + jx1, and the secondary impedance is Z2 = r2 + jx2. But when a load is connected to the secondary, the equivalent impedance seen from the primary side can be tricky because of the turns ratio.

Wait, the transformer's turns ratio is a: a = V1 / V2. Since V1 is 2400 V and V2 is 240 V, the turns ratio a is 2400 / 240 = 10. So the primary has 10 times more turns than the secondary.

The secondary impedance Z2 is r2 + jx2. The primary impedance as seen from the primary side (reflected) would be (a^2) * Z2. Because when you refer an impedance from the secondary to the primary, you multiply by the square of the turns ratio.

So, Z2_reflected = a² * Z2 = (10)^2 * (0.03 + j0.15) = 100 * (0.03 + j0.15) = 3 + j15 Ω.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, the primary impedance Z1 is r1 + jx1, and the secondary impedance is Z2, but the equivalent impedance when the secondary is connected to a load can be calculated using the formula for two transformers in a circuit.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the transformer as a two-winding circuit with the load connected. So the primary side has voltage V1, and the secondary side has the load.

Wait, maybe it's better to use the equivalent circuit approach. The equivalent circuit of a transformer has the primary winding, the secondary winding with the load, and the magnetizing current. But since the magnetizing current is usually very small, we can neglect it in most cases, especially when dealing with power calculations.

So, the primary side has resistance r1 and reactance x1, and the secondary side has r2, x2, and the load impedance Z_load. The load impedance Z_load is V2 / I2, but considering the power factor. Wait, no. Actually, the load impedance depends on the power factor. Since the load is at the secondary, the load impedance is Z_load = (V2) / I2, but the current I2 is S / V2. Wait, but that's for the magnitude. The power factor affects the phase angle, so the impedance's phase angle changes.

Wait, perhaps I should model the load as a resistor in series with a reactance, depending on the power factor. For 0.8 lagging, the load is inductive, so Z_load = R_load + jX_load, where X_load is positive. For 0.8 leading, it's R_load - jX_load.

But maybe an easier way is to compute the current I2, then find the voltage drop in the secondary, and then compute the primary voltage considering the primary drop and the secondary drop.

Wait, let me proceed step by step.

First, the transformer is 10 kVA, so S = 10,000 VA.

At full load, the secondary current I2 is S / V2. So I2 = 10,000 / 240 ≈ 41.6667 A.

The power factor is 0.8, so cosφ = 0.8. For part (a), it's lagging, so φ = 36.87 degrees (since cos⁻¹(0.8) ≈ 36.87°), meaning the current lags the voltage by that angle.

But for the magnitude of current, I2 is 41.6667 A, as before.

Now, the secondary side has a load, which in this case can be modeled as a resistor and reactance. Alternatively, since the load has a power factor, the load impedance Z_load is V2 / I2, but considering the power factor.

Wait, but I think the correct approach is to model the load as Z_load = (V2) / I2 * (cosφ + j sinφ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the power factor is 0.8, the load's impedance is R_load = V2 / I2 * cosφ, and X_load = V2 / I2 * (sinφ / cosφ) = V2 / I2 * tanφ.

Wait, let me compute that.

For part (a), φ = 36.87°, so tanφ = 0.75. So, X_load = (240 V / 41.6667 A) * 0.75 ≈ (5.76) * 0.75 ≈ 4.32 Ω.

Wait, but wait, that would be the inductive reactance. Alternatively, perhaps the load's impedance is Z_load = (V2) / I2, but since the power factor is 0.8, the impedance magnitude is |Z_load| = V2 / I2 = 240 / 41.6667 ≈ 5.76 Ω. Then, the power factor is cosφ = 0.8, so the real part is 5.76 * 0.8 ≈ 4.608 Ω, and the imaginary part is 5.76 * 0.6 ≈ 3.456 Ω (since sin(36.87) ≈ 0.6). So Z_load = 4.608 + j3.456 Ω.

Wait, but that might not be necessary. Alternatively, since the load is at the secondary, and the secondary's impedance is Z2 = r2 + jx2, the total impedance on the secondary side is Z2 in parallel with the load impedance Z_load. Wait, no, because the load is connected across the secondary terminals, so the current splits into the secondary winding's current and the load current, but wait, actually, the secondary's current I2 is the sum of the current through Z2 and the load current. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating things.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model the entire system using the equivalent circuit. The primary side has voltage V1, and the equivalent impedance is Z1 = r1 + jx1. The secondary side has the load impedance Z_load and the secondary's own impedance Z2. But since the transformer's secondary is connected to the load, the total impedance on the secondary side is Z2 in series with Z_load.

Wait, but that's not correct because the secondary's impedance is in series with the load impedance. So the total impedance on the secondary side is Z2 + Z_load. But when considering the primary side, this impedance is transformed by the turns ratio.

Wait, perhaps I should use the referred impedance method. The secondary side impedance Z_load is referred to the primary side by multiplying by (a)^2, where a is the turns ratio. So Z_load_ref = a² * Z_load.

But Z_load depends on the power factor, so for each case (a and b), I need to compute Z_load.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the entire circuit with the primary and secondary impedances and the load.

Let me try to approach this systematically.

The primary side has a source voltage V1, and the primary winding has impedance Z1 = r1 + jx1 = 3 + j15 Ω.

The secondary side has the load impedance Z_load, which depends on the power factor. The secondary winding has impedance Z2 = 0.03 + j0.15 Ω.

So, the secondary side's total impedance is Z2 + Z_load.

But when looking from the primary side, the secondary impedance Z2 and Z_load are scaled by the turns ratio squared. So, the equivalent impedance on the primary side would be (Z2 + Z_load) * a², where a = 2400 / 240 = 10.

So, the equivalent circuit from the primary side is V1 across Z1 and (Z2 + Z_load) * a².

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe it's better to model the transformer as a two-winding circuit and apply the phasor diagram method.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for voltage regulation. Voltage regulation is the change in voltage from no load to full load. The formula is:

Voltage Regulation = (V1 - V2) / V2 * 100%

But in this problem, we're given V2 at the secondary terminals under full load, and we need to find V1. So, perhaps we can model the voltage drops in the primary and secondary windings.

The primary voltage V1 is the sum of the induced EMF (which equals the secondary voltage V2 when there's no load, but with a load, it's different) minus the voltage drops in the primary and secondary windings.

Wait, but I think the correct equation is:

V1 = (E1) + I1 * (r1 + jx1)

where E1 is the induced EMF in the primary, and I1 is the primary current.

Similarly, the secondary voltage V2 is given by:

V2 = E2 - I2 * (r2 + jx2)

But because the transformer's primary and secondary windings are magnetically linked, E1 = a * E2, where a is the turns ratio. Since E2 is the induced EMF in the secondary, E1 = a * E2.

But wait, when the secondary is loaded, E2 is not equal to V2 because of the voltage drop in the secondary's resistance and reactance.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the equations in terms of I1 and I2.

In a transformer, the primary current I1 is related to the secondary current I2 by I1 = I2 * (a2), because of the turns ratio. Wait, no, the current in the primary is I1, and the current in the secondary is I2, so I1 = (1/a) * I2, because the current in the primary is smaller by the turns ratio. So, I1 = I2 / a.

Wait, that makes sense because the transformer steps down the voltage, so the current increases by the turns ratio.

So, I1 = I2 / a.

Now, considering the primary side:

V1 = I1 * (r1 + jx1) + (E1)

But E1 is the induced EMF in the primary, which is equal to a * E2.

And E2 is the induced EMF in the secondary, which is E2 = V2 + I2 * (r2 + jx2).

So,

E1 = a * (V2 + I2 * (r2 + jx2))

And substituting E1 into the primary equation:

V1 = I1 * (r1 + jx1) + a * (V2 + I2 * (r2 + jx2))

But since I1 = I2 / a, we can substitute that in.

So,

V1 = (I2 / a) * (r1 + jx1) + a * (V2 + I2 * (r2 + jx2))

Now, let's plug in the known values.

Given:

a = 10 (since V1 = 2400 V, V2 = 240 V)

r1 = 3 Ω

x1 = 15 Ω

r2 = 0.03 Ω

x2 = 0.15 Ω

I2 = 10,000 VA / 240 V = 41.6667 A

So,

V1 = (41.6667 / 10) * (3 + j15) + 10 * (240 + 41.6667 * (0.03 + j0.15))

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute (41.6667 / 10) * (3 + j15):

41.6667 / 10 = 4.16667

4.16667 * 3 = 12.5

4.16667 * 15 = 62.5

So, the first term is 12.5 + j62.5 V.

Now, compute the second term: 10 * (240 + 41.6667 * (0.03 + j0.15))

First, calculate 41.6667 * 0.03 = 1.25 V

41.6667 * 0.15 = 6.25 j V

So, 41.6667 * (0.03 + j0.15) = 1.25 + j6.25

Now, add 240 V:

240 + 1.25 + j6.25 = 241.25 + j6.25

Multiply by 10:

10 * (241.25 + j6.25) = 2412.5 + j62.5 V.

Now, add the two terms together:

First term: 12.5 + j62.5

Second term: 2412.5 + j62.5

Adding real parts: 12.5 + 2412.5 = 2425 V

Adding imaginary parts: 62.5 + 62.5 = 125 j V

So, V1 = 2425 + j125 V.

But wait, that can't be right because the options don't have a 2425 V. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check. Maybe I should consider the power factor in the calculation because the current I2 has a phase angle depending on the load's power factor. Oh wait! I think I forgot to account for the power factor in the current I2's phase. Because I2 has a phase angle φ, which affects the voltage drops.

Ah, that's a crucial point I missed. The current I2 is not purely resistive; it has a phase angle. So, the voltage drops in the resistances and reactances will have components due to the current's phase.

So, I2 is 41.6667 A at a phase angle of φ, where cosφ = 0.8.

So, for part (a), φ = 36.87°, so the current I2 lags the voltage by that angle. That means the current is at a phase angle of -36.87° (since it's lagging), and the voltage drops will have components based on that.

Wait, but in the equations, I treated I2 as a magnitude without considering the phase. So, I need to correct that.

Hmm, this complicates things because now the current has a phase angle, which affects the voltage drops in the windings.

So, perhaps I should model I2 as a phasor with magnitude 41.6667 A and angle -36.87°, and then compute the voltage drops in r2 and x2 accordingly.

Let me try to approach this again, considering the phase angle.

So, I2 is 41.6667 A at an angle of -36.87°, because it's lagging (for part a).

So, I2 can be written as 41.6667 * (cos(-36.87°) + j sin(-36.87°)).

Compute cos(-36.87) = 0.8, and sin(-36.87) = -0.6. So, I2 = 41.6667 * (0.8 - j0.6) = 33.33336 - j25 A.

Now, let's compute the voltage drops in the secondary winding.

The secondary voltage drop is I2 * (r2 + jx2).

So, Vdrop_secondary = (33.33336 - j25) * (0.03 + j0.15)

Let me compute this multiplication:

= 33.33336 * 0.03 + 33.33336 * j0.15 + (-j25) * 0.03 + (-j25) * j0.15

Compute each term:

33.33336 * 0.03 = 1.0 V

33.33336 * 0.15 j = 5 j V

- j25 * 0.03 = -0.75 j V

- j25 * j0.15 = -j² * 3.75 = +3.75 V (since j² = -1)

So, adding up the real parts: 1.0 V + 3.75 V = 4.75 V

Adding up the imaginary parts: 5 j V - 0.75 j V = 4.25 j V

So, Vdrop_secondary = 4.75 + j4.25 V.

Now, the secondary voltage E2 is given by:

E2 = V2 + Vdrop_secondary

But wait, no, because the secondary voltage V2 is measured at the terminals, so the induced EMF E2 is V2 plus the voltage drop in the secondary winding.

Wait, no, actually, the secondary terminal voltage V2 is E2 minus the voltage drop due to the secondary's impedance. So,

V2 = E2 - (I2 * (r2 + jx2))

Which rearranged gives:

E2 = V2 + I2 * (r2 + jx2)

But since I2 is a phasor, we have to compute this correctly.

So, E2 = V2 + (33.33336 - j25) * (0.03 + j0.15)

Which we just computed as 4.75 + j4.25 V.

So, E2 = 240 V + 4.75 + j4.25 V = 244.75 + j4.25 V.

Now, the induced EMF in the primary E1 is related to E2 by the turns ratio a.

E1 = a * E2 = 10 * (244.75 + j4.25) = 2447.5 + j42.5 V.

Now, the primary current I1 is I2 / a = (33.33336 - j25) / 10 = 3.333336 - j2.5 A.

Now, the primary voltage V1 is given by:

V1 = I1 * (r1 + jx1) + E1

So, compute I1 * (r1 + jx1):

I1 = 3.333336 - j2.5 A

r1 + jx1 = 3 + j15 Ω

Multiplying:

(3.333336 - j2.5) * (3 + j15)

= 3.333336 * 3 + 3.333336 * j15 + (-j2.5) * 3 + (-j2.5) * j15

= 10 + 50 j - 7.5 j - j² 37.5

= 10 + (50 -7.5) j + 37.5 (since j² = -1)

= 10 + 42.5 j + 37.5

= 47.5 + 42.5 j V

Now, add E1 to this:

V1 = (47.5 + 42.5 j) + (2447.5 + j42.5)

= 47.5 + 2447.5 + (42.5 j + 42.5 j)

= 2495 V + 85 j V

So, V1 is 2495 V plus a j85 V. But the primary voltage is typically a real voltage, so perhaps I made a mistake in the phase consideration.

Wait, this can't be right because the primary voltage shouldn't have a significant imaginary component. Maybe I messed up the phasor directions.

Wait, perhaps the induced EMF E1 is in phase with the primary voltage V1. So, if the load is lagging, the current I2 is lagging, which affects the phase of E2 and thus E1.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the primary voltage V1 has a phase angle, so the real and imaginary parts represent the magnitude and phase.

But looking at the options, the primary voltages are all real numbers, so perhaps I need to find the magnitude of V1.

Wait, V1 is 2495 + j85 V, so its magnitude is sqrt(2495² + 85²) ≈ sqrt(6,225,025 + 7,225) ≈ sqrt(6,232,250) ≈ 2496.45 V.

Looking at the options, option I is 2496.5 V for part (a), which matches this.

Wait, but let me check. The calculation gives 2495 + j85, which is approximately 2496.45 V. So, for part (a), the primary voltage is approximately 2496.5 V, which is option I.

Now, for part (b), the power factor is 0.8 leading, so φ = -36.87°, meaning the current I2 leads the voltage by that angle.

So, I2 = 41.6667 A at an angle of 36.87°, which is cos(36.87) = 0.8, sin(36.87) = 0.6. So, I2 = 41.6667 * (0.8 + j0.6) = 33.33336 + j25 A.

Now, compute the secondary voltage drop:

Vdrop_secondary = I2 * (r2 + jx2) = (33.33336 + j25) * (0.03 + j0.15)

Expanding this:

= 33.33336 * 0.03 + 33.33336 * j0.15 + j25 * 0.03 + j25 * j0.15

= 1.0 + 5 j + 0.75 j + j² 3.75

= 1.0 + (5 + 0.75) j -3.75

= (1.0 -3.75) + 5.75 j

= -2.75 + j5.75 V

So, the secondary voltage V2 is E2 - Vdrop_secondary, so E2 = V2 + Vdrop_secondary.

E2 = 240 V + (-2.75 + j5.75) V = 237.25 + j5.75 V.

Now, E1 = a * E2 = 10 * (237.25 + j5.75) = 2372.5 + j57.5 V.

The primary current I1 = I2 / a = (33.33336 + j25) / 10 = 3.333336 + j2.5 A.

Compute I1 * (r1 + jx1):

I1 = 3.333336 + j2.5 A

r1 + jx1 = 3 + j15 Ω

Multiplying:

(3.333336 + j2.5) * (3 + j15)

= 3.333336*3 + 3.333336*j15 + j2.5*3 + j2.5*j15

= 10 + 50 j + 7.5 j + j²37.5

= 10 + 57.5 j -37.5

= (10 -37.5) + 57.5 j

= -27.5 + 57.5 j V

Now, add E1:

V1 = (-27.5 + 57.5 j) + (2372.5 + j57.5)

= (-27.5 + 2372.5) + (57.5 j + 57.5 j)

= 2345 + 115 j V

The magnitude of V1 is sqrt(2345² + 115²) ≈ sqrt(5,496,025 + 13,225) ≈ sqrt(5,509,250) ≈ 2347.5 V.

Looking at the options, for part (b), the secondary voltage is supposed to be 240 V, but we're looking for the primary voltage. Wait, the options are for the primary and secondary voltages. Wait, no, the question is asking for the primary voltage V1 required to produce 240 V at the secondary terminals under full load for each power factor.

Wait, in part (a), we found V1 ≈ 2496.5 V, which matches option I's first value.

In part (b), the calculation gives V1 ≈ 2347.5 V. Looking at the options, option I has 2496.5 V for part (a) and 2347.8 V for part (b). So, that matches.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option I is "2496.5 V and 2347.8 V". So, part (a) is 2496.5 V, part (b) is 2347.8 V.

But wait, in my calculation for part (b), I got V1 ≈ 2347.5 V, which is close to 2347.8 V, so that's correct.

Therefore, the correct answer is option I: 2496.5 V and 2347.8 V.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the transformer's behavior under full load conditions for both lagging and leading power factors. The transformer has a rating of 10 kVA, with primary and secondary voltages of 2400 V and 240 V, respectively. The resistances and reactances of the windings are given, and the goal is to determine the primary voltage required to maintain 240 V at the secondary terminals.

### Key Steps:

1. **Determine the Secondary Current**:
   The secondary current \( I_2 \) is calculated using the transformer's rating:
   \[
   I_2 = \frac{S}{V_2} = \frac{10,000}{240} \approx 41.67 \, \text{A}.
   \]

2. **Account for Power Factor**:
   For both lagging (\( \cos\phi = 0.8 \)) and leading (\( \cos\phi = 0.8 \)) power factors, the current \( I_2 \) has a phase angle. The magnitude of \( I_2 \) remains the same, but its phase changes.

3. **Secondary Voltage Drop**:
   The voltage drop in the secondary winding is calculated using:
   \[
   V_{\text{drop, secondary}} = I_2 \cdot (r_2 + jx_2).
   \]
   For lagging power factor, \( I_2 \) lags the voltage, and for leading, it leads the voltage. This affects the sign of the imaginary component in the voltage drop.

4. **Induced EMF in Secondary**:
   The induced EMF in the secondary \( E_2 \) is:
   \[
   E_2 = V_2 + V_{\text{drop, secondary}}.
   \]

5. **Transform EMF to Primary**:
   Using the turns ratio \( a = 10 \), the induced EMF in the primary \( E_1 \) is:
   \[
   E_1 = a \cdot E_2.
   \]

6. **Primary Voltage**:
   The primary voltage \( V_1 \) accounts for the voltage drop in the primary winding and the induced EMF:
   \[
   V_1 = E_1 + I_1 \cdot (r_1 + jx_1),
   \]
   where \( I_1 = \frac{I_2}{a} \).

7. **Magnitude of Primary Voltage**:
   The magnitude of \( V_1 \) is calculated as:
   \[
   |V_1| = \sqrt{\text{Re}(V_1)^2 + \text{Im}(V_1)^2}.
   \]

### Calculations:

- **Lagging Power Factor (0.8 lagging)**:
  - \( I_2 = 41.67 \, \text{A} \) at \( -36.87^\circ \).
  - Secondary voltage drop: \( V_{\text{drop, secondary}} = 4.75 + j4.25 \, \text{V} \).
  - \( E_2 = 240 + 4.75 + j4.25 = 244.75 + j4.25 \, \text{V} \).
  - \( E_1 = 10 \cdot (244.75 + j4.25) = 2447.5 + j42.5 \, \text{V} \).
  - Primary current: \( I_1 = 3.333 + j2.5 \, \text{A} \).
  - Primary voltage drop: \( I_1 \cdot (r_1 + jx_1) = 47.5 + 42.5j \, \text{V} \).
  - Total \( V_1 = 2447.5 + j42.5 + 47.5 + 42.5j = 2495 + j85 \, \text{V} \).
  - Magnitude: \( |V_1| \approx 2496.5 \, \text{V} \).

- **Leading Power Factor (0.8 leading)**:
  - \( I_2 = 41.67 \, \text{A} \) at \( 36.87^\circ \).
  - Secondary voltage drop: \( V_{\text{drop, secondary}} = -2.75 + j5.75 \, \text{V} \).
  - \( E_2 = 240 - 2.75 + j5.75 = 237.25 + j5.75 \, \text{V} \).
  - \( E_1 = 10 \cdot (237.25 + j5.75) = 2372.5 + j57.5 \, \text{V} \).
  - Primary current: \( I_1 = 3.333 + j2.5 \, \text{A} \).
  - Primary voltage drop: \( I_1 \cdot (r_1 + jx_1) = -27.5 + 57.5j \, \text{V} \).
  - Total \( V_1 = 2372.5 + j57.5 - 27.5 + 57.5j = 2345 + 115j \, \text{V} \).
  - Magnitude: \( |V_1| \approx 2347.8 \, \text{V} \).

### Final Answer:
