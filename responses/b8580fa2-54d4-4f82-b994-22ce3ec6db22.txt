Okay, so I have this question about which animal has the longest lifespan. The options are human, parrot, lion, elephant, dog, tortoise, kangaroo, queen honey bee, blue whale, and gorilla. I need to figure out which one lives the longest.

First, I'll think about each animal's lifespan. I know humans have a pretty long lifespan, usually around 70-100 years, but maybe more for some. Parrots can live a long time too; I've heard that some species can live up to 80 years or more. Lions in the wild might live about 10-15 years, but in captivity, maybe longer, like up to 20. Elephants are known to live around 60-70 years, so that's pretty long.

Dogs vary a lot depending on the breed, but the average is maybe 10-15 years, so that's not the longest. Tortoises are known for being long-lived. I think some species can live over 100 years, like the Galapagos tortoise. Kangaroos, I'm not too sure, but I think they live around 20 years or so in the wild.

Queen honey bees have a very short lifespan, just a few weeks, so that's definitely not the answer. Blue whales are the largest animals, and I think they can live up to 80-100 years. Gorillas, our great ape cousins, live around 30-50 years in the wild, maybe longer in captivity.

So putting it all together: Humans up to 100, parrots maybe 80, elephants around 70, tortoises over 100, blue whales up to 100. Wait, I think blue whales are around that age, but I'm not certain. Tortoises, though, I'm pretty sure can live longer than 100 years. So the options are F: Tortoise, and maybe A: Human, but humans don't typically reach 150. The longest-lived tortoise I remember hearing about lived over 150 years. So the tortoise has the longest lifespan among the options given.

The animal with the longest lifespan from the given options is the tortoise, which can live over 100 years, with some species reaching up to 150 years or more.

Answer: F
