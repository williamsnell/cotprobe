Question:

According to Buzan, Waever, and de Wilde, in what ways does the Copenhagen School's approach to Security Studies differ from that of Critical Security Studies?

Options:

A: The theory and knowledge that underpin each approach are fundamentally at odds with one another. Whilst Critical Security Studies is post-structuralist and constructivist, the Copenhagen School is based on an objectivist epistemology.
B: Whilst Critical Security Studies regards security to be a social construction, based on the changeable ideas that form human society, the Copenhagen school disregards this epistemological approach and instead considers security as an issue to be studied objectively from a positivist approach.
C: Critical Security Studies regards security to be an empirically definable state, which should be studied from a positivist approach. However, the Copenhagen School views security as a socially constructed entity that denies the validity of an objective approach.
D: Neither Critical Security Studies nor the Copenhagen School account for the changing nature of society and its impact on the construction of security.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about the differences between the Copenhagen School's approach and Critical Security Studies as per Buzan, Waever, and de Wilde. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

First, I should recall what each of these approaches entails. I remember that the Copenhagen School is associated with a more traditional, state-centric view of security, focusing on the state as the primary actor and threats as objective dangers. They probably use a more positivist approach, which means they believe in observable, measurable data and objective truths.

On the other hand, Critical Security Studies, I think, is more about deconstructing the traditional notion of security. They might argue that security is a social construct influenced by power dynamics, identities, and discourses. This sounds more like a post-structuralist or constructivist approach, which would mean they don't see security as something fixed or empirically definable.

Looking at the options:

Option A says that the theories are fundamentally at odds, with Critical Security Studies being post-structuralist and constructivist, while the Copenhagen School is objectivist. That makes sense because I think the Copenhagen School is more about objective analysis, so this seems correct. But I should check the others.

Option B states that Critical Security Studies sees security as a social construction based on ideas, while the Copenhagen School considers it to be studied objectively from a positivist approach. Wait, that's similar to what I was thinking. So this option is also correct in a way, but I need to see how it's worded compared to others.

Option C claims that Critical Security Studies regards security as empirically definable (positivist) and the Copenhagen School views it as socially constructed, denying objective approaches. That seems backward because I thought Critical Security Studies is the one that's more about social construction, not the Copenhagen School. So Option C is probably incorrect.

Option D says neither accounts for changing society's impact on security construction. But I don't think that's right because both approaches do address societal factors in different ways. The Copenhagen School might focus more on state-centric aspects, while Critical Security Studies looks at broader social dynamics.

So between Options A and B. Option A says their theories are fundamentally at odds, with Critical being post-struct and constructivist, and Copenhagen being objectivist. Option B says Critical sees security as a social construction, while Copenhagen uses positivism.

Wait, the question is about how they differ. So the key difference is in their epistemological approaches. The Copenhagen School is more positivist/objectivist, studying security as an objective issue. Critical Security Studies is constructivist, seeing security as a social construct.

So looking back, Option B says Critical regards security as a social construction (which aligns with CSS), while Copenhagen disregards this and uses positivism. That's accurate. 

Option A says that their theories are fundamentally at odds, which is true, but the way it's phrased might not directly address the question as clearly as Option B. The question is about the ways they differ, so Option B directly contrasts their views on security's nature.

Therefore, the correct answer should be Option B.

The Copenhagen School and Critical Security Studies (CSS) differ in their epistemological approaches. The Copenhagen School adopts a positivist perspective, viewing security as an objective issue to be studied through empirical methods. In contrast, CSS sees security as a social construction influenced by ideas, power dynamics, and discourses, aligning with a post-structuralist and constructivist framework. This distinction highlights their differing views on the nature of security.

Answer: B
