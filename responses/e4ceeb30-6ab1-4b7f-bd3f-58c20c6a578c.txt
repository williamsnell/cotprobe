Question:

Suppose that the wage rate is $30 per day and a factory owner is considering how many workers to hire. Using the table below, determine how many workers should be hired in order to maximize profits (total revenues less total costs). Input (Labor) Value of Marginal Product per day 6 7 8 9 10 $50 70 35 20 10

Options:

A: Eight
B: Nine
C: Four
D: Eleven
E: Twelve
F: Ten
G: Three
H: Five
I: Seven
J: Six

Okay, so I've got this economics problem here, and I need to figure out how many workers a factory owner should hire to maximize profits. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

Alright, the wage rate is $30 per day. The factory owner is trying to decide how many workers to hire. There's a table provided with input (labor) and the value of marginal product (VMP) per day. The numbers are:

Input (Labor): 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
VMP per day: $50, $70, $35, $20, $10

The options are from A to J, with numbers like Eight, Nine, etc.

So, I remember that profit is maximized where the marginal revenue product (MRP) equals the marginal cost (MC). In this case, the wage rate is the marginal cost because each additional worker costs $30.

The value of marginal product is given, which I think is the same as MRP. So the goal is to find the point where VMP equals the wage rate, or where adding another worker wouldn't increase profit anymore.

Let me list out the data again:

Number of workers | VMP
6 | $50
7 | $70
8 | $35
9 | $20
10 | $10

Wait, that's a bit strange. The VMP increases from 6 to 7 workers, then drops off a cliff. So at 7 workers, VMP is $70, which is higher than the wage rate of $30. So definitely, they should hire more than 7. Wait no, wait: wait, I think I might have misread the table. Let me check again.

Wait the first line is Input (Labor): 6,7,8,9,10. The VMP is 50,70,35,20,10. So for 6 workers, VMP is 50; for 7, it's 70; then it drops to 35 at 8, then 20 at 9, and 10 at 10.

But wait, wait, theVMP is the additional revenue from hiring one more worker. So the factory should keep hiring workers as long as the VMP is higher than the wage rate.

So let's look at each worker and their VMP:

Worker 1: VMP=50. Since 50>30, hire.
Worker 2: VMP=70>30, hire.
Worker 3: VMP=35>30, hire.
Worker 4: VMP=20<30, so stop here.

Wait, but wait, the data provided is for number of workers, not per worker. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the table.

Wait, maybe the first number is the number of workers, and the second is the corresponding VMP. So when they have 6 workers, the VMP is 50. Then when they hire a 7th worker, the VMP added is 70. That seems odd because marginal products usually decrease, but here it increases from 6 to 7 and then drops. That's unusual but possible.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of each additional worker's VMP. So:

Number of workers | VMP
6 | 50 (this is the VMP when adding the 6th worker)
7 | 70 (VMP of 7th worker)
8 | 35 (VMP of 8th worker)
9 | 20 (VMP of 9th)
10 | 10 (VMP of 10th)

Wait, that makes more sense. So each additional worker beyond the current number adds that VMP.

So to maximize profit, the factory should hire workers until the VMP of the next worker is equal to or just above the wage rate.

So let's see:

- 6th worker: VMP=50. Since 50>30, hire.
- 7th worker: VMP=70>30, hire.
- 8th worker: VMP=35>30, hire.
- 9th worker: VMP=20<30. So stop here.

Wait, so the factory should hire up to the 8th worker because the 9th worker's VMP is less than the wage rate.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. The total profit is total revenue minus total cost. Total cost is wage rate times number of workers.

Alternatively, profit is maximized when the VMP of the last worker equals the wage rate.

So, the rule is to hire workers until VMP = wage.

Looking at each VMP:

6th worker: 50>30 → hire.

7th worker: 70>30 → hire.

8th worker: 35>30 → hire.

9th worker: 20<30 → don't hire.

So the last worker hired is the 8th, because the 9th would add less revenue than the cost.

Wait, but wait, the table goes up to 10 workers, but the VMP for the 9th is 20, which is below 30. So the factory should stop at 8 workers.

So the correct answer should be 8 workers.

Looking at the options, A is Eight, so the answer should be A.

To determine the optimal number of workers to maximize profits, we compare the Value of Marginal Product (VMP) of each additional worker to the wage rate of $30. Profits are maximized when the VMP equals the wage rate. 

- **6th worker**: VMP = $50 > $30 → hire.
- **7th worker**: VMP = $70 > $30 → hire.
- **8th worker**: VMP = $35 > $30 → hire.
- **9th worker**: VMP = $20 < $30 → stop.

Thus, the factory should hire 8 workers to maximize profits.
