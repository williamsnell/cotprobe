Okay, so I have this problem about Paul and his lunch choices. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

Alright, Paul likes Twinkies (t) and soda (s). His utility function is U(t,s) = sqrt(ts). That means his happiness is the square root of the product of Twinkies and soda. So, to maximize his utility, he needs to choose the right combination of t and s given his budget.

First, I need to understand his budget. Twinkies cost $0.10 each, and soda is $0.25 per cup. His mom gives him $1, so he has a total of $1 to spend. 

So, the budget constraint is: 0.10t + 0.25s = 1. Because he can't spend more than $1.

Now, the goal is to maximize U(t,s) = sqrt(ts) subject to the budget constraint. Since the square root function is increasing, maximizing U is equivalent to maximizing ts. So, we can instead maximize the product ts, which might be easier.

To maximize ts, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or the concept of equating marginal utilities. Let me think about the marginal utility approach. 

Marginal utility of t (MU_t) is the derivative of U with respect to t. But since U = sqrt(ts), the derivative would be (1/(2*sqrt(ts))) * s. Similarly, the marginal utility of s (MU_s) is (1/(2*sqrt(ts))) * t.

In consumer theory, the optimal choice occurs where the ratio of marginal utilities equals the ratio of prices. So, MU_t / MU_s = price_t / price_s.

Let me write that out:

MU_t / MU_s = (s/(2*sqrt(ts))) ) / (t/(2*sqrt(ts))) ) = s/t.

And this should equal the price ratio, which is price_t / price_s = 0.10 / 0.25 = 0.4.

So, s/t = 0.4 → s = 0.4t.

Now, we can substitute s = 0.4t into the budget constraint to find t.

Budget: 0.10t + 0.25s = 1.

Substituting s: 0.10t + 0.25*(0.4t) = 1.

Calculating 0.25 * 0.4t: that's 0.10t.

So the equation becomes 0.10t + 0.10t = 1 → 0.20t = 1 → t = 1 / 0.20 = 5.

So, t=5. That would mean Paul should buy 5 Twinkies. Let me check if that's one of the options.

Looking at the options, G is 5. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

So, s = 0.4t → if t=5, s=2. Then, the cost is 5*0.10 + 2*0.25 = 0.50 + 0.50 = $1. That fits the budget.

Alternatively, let's try other options to see. For example, if he buys 4 Twinkies (option D), then s would be 0.4*4=1.6 cups. But soda can't be a fraction, but maybe it's okay in theory. The cost would be 4*0.10=0.40, and 1.6*0.25=0.40, total $0.80. He still has $0.20 left. So maybe he could buy more. But according to our earlier calculation, 5 is the optimal. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the Lagrange multiplier method to confirm.

The Lagrangian is L = sqrt(ts) + λ(1 - 0.10t -0.25s).

Taking partial derivatives:

∂L/∂t = (s)/(2√(ts)) - 0.10λ = 0

∂L/∂s = (t)/(2√(ts)) - 0.25λ = 0

From the first equation: (s)/(2√(ts)) = 0.10λ → s/(2√(ts)) = 0.10λ.

From the second: t/(2√(ts)) = 0.25λ.

Divide the first equation by the second: (s/(2√(ts))) / (t/(2√(ts))) ) = (0.10λ)/(0.25λ).

Simplify: s/t = 0.10/0.25 = 0.4 → same as before.

So yes, s = 0.4t. So, same result as before. So t=5, s=2.

Therefore, the correct answer is G:5.

Paul aims to maximize his utility \( U(t, s) = \sqrt{ts} \) with a budget of $1, where Twinkies cost $0.10 each and soda costs $0.25 per cup. The budget constraint is \( 0.10t + 0.25s = 1 \). To maximize utility, the ratio of marginal utilities should equal the price ratio: \( \frac{s}{t} = \frac{0.10}{0.25} = 0.4 \), leading to \( s = 0.4t \). Substituting \( s = 0.4t \) into the budget constraint gives \( 0.10t + 0.25(0.4t) = 1 \), simplifying to \( t = 5 \). Thus, Paul should buy 5 Twinkies.
