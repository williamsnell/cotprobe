Okay, so I have this question about the treatment of Bulimia Nervosa, and I need to choose the correct answer from options A to J. I'm a bit rusty on my psychology, but I'll try to think it through.

First, what do I remember about Bulimia Nervosa? It's an eating disorder characterized by episodes of binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors like vomiting, laxative use, or excessive exercise. People with bulimia often have an intense fear of gaining weight and a distorted body image.

The question is about treatment approaches. I remember that treatment isn't just about one aspect; it's usually comprehensive. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: It is not useful to discuss weight with patients. Hmm, I think discussing weight is actually important because weight management is part of the treatment. However, the approach has to be sensitive and not focused solely on weight loss. But saying it's not useful at all might be incorrect. I'm not sure yet.

Option B: Treatment should focus solely on physical symptoms. No, that doesn't sound right. Bulimia has both physical and psychological aspects. Treating only the physical symptoms, like the digestive issues from purging, wouldn't address the underlying psychological problems. So B is probably wrong.

Option C: Therapies should primarily focus on food avoidance tactics. Wait, food avoidance is more about not eating certain foods, but bulimia involves bingeing. I think the focus is more on understanding eating patterns and behaviors rather than just avoiding food. So C might not be correct.

Option D: Use of antipsychotic medication is first-line treatment. I don't recall antipsychotics being first-line. Usually, the first-line treatments are psychological therapies like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Maybe antidepressants, but not antipsychotics. So D is likely incorrect.

Option E: The first approach is to discuss body image. That makes sense because body image is a core issue in bulimia. Addressing distortions in body image is probably an early step in treatment, so E could be correct.

Option F: Fluoxetine is considered of benefit. Fluoxetine is a type of SSRI, and I think it's approved for bulimia. It helps with the psychological symptoms, so F sounds correct. But I also need to check if it's part of the treatment options.

Option G: Treatment should prioritize on patients' social relationships. While social support is important, I don't think it's the primary focus. Treatment usually addresses the disorder itself first, so G might not be the best choice.

Option H: Treatments should target exclusively on purging practices. No, treatment should address both the bingeing and purging behaviors, not just one aspect. So H is incorrect.

Option I: The main treatment approach is diet control. Diet control alone isn't the main approach. It's more about behavior modification and psychological issues. So I is probably wrong.

Option J: Treatment should ignore the psychological aspects of the disorder. Definitely not. Bulimia has strong psychological components, so J is incorrect.

Now, evaluating the options again. E and F are looking good. The question asks what is correct to state about treatment. So both could be correct, but I need to see which one is an accurate statement.

Wait, the question is about the correct statement, so perhaps more than one option could be correct. But since it's a multiple-choice question, I need to pick the best answer.

I think E is correct because addressing body image is an important initial step. As for F, fluoxetine is indeed used, but is it the first approach? Or is it part of the treatment alongside therapy?

The question is about what is correct to state, so both E and F could be correct. But looking at the options, the question might be selecting the best answer. Let me think again.

In treatment for bulimia, CBT is often the first-line psychological treatment. It addresses distorted thoughts about food and weight. So discussing body image (E) is part of that. Fluoxetine is sometimes used, especially if there are comorbid issues like depression, but it's not the first approach in terms of treatment initiation. So the first approach is more likely to be discussing body image and using CBT.

Therefore, I think E is correct. But wait, the options are separate. Let me check the options again.

The options are individual statements. So E says the first approach is to discuss body image, which makes sense. F says fluoxetine is considered of benefit, which is also correct because it's an effective medication for bulimia when used alongside therapy.

But the question is about what is correct to state about the treatment. So both E and F are correct statements. Wait, but the options are A to J, so perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, in reality, both E and F are correct, but the options are separate. So if the question allows selecting multiple, but since it's a single choice, I need to see which is more correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for F because fluoxetine is a pharmacological treatment that is considered beneficial. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the answer.

Wait, the question is whether the statement is correct. So both E and F are correct statements. But the way the options are presented, perhaps only one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F because fluoxetine is an established treatment. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I think the first-line treatment for bulimia is usually psychological, like CBT, and medication like fluoxetine is used as an adjunct. So the first approach would be discussing body image (E), making E correct. But fluoxetine is also correct (F). Hmm.

But the question is about what is correct to state. So both E and F are correct, but the options are separate. But in the options, only one can be selected. So perhaps the best answer is F because it's a fact that fluoxetine is used.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me look up quickly (but since I can't access the internet, I'll have to rely on memory). Fluoxetine is indeed approved for bulimia and is considered effective. So F is correct. Also, discussing body image is part of treatment, so E is correct.

But if the question is asking for the correct statement, and both E and F are correct, but the options are separate, perhaps the intended answer is F.

Alternatively, perhaps the first approach is to discuss body image, so E is correct.

Wait, in treatment, the initial steps often involve assessing the physical health and then addressing psychological aspects, including body image. So E is correct.

But I'm a bit torn between E and F. However, the question is about what is correct to state, so both could be correct. But in the options, only one is to be chosen.

Wait, the answer options are from A to J, and I need to pick one. I think both E and F are correct, but perhaps the question is looking for F because it's a medication that's beneficial.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F. I think I'll go with F because it's a well-known treatment.

The correct answer is **F: Fluoxetine is considered of benefit**. Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is an established treatment for Bulimia Nervosa, particularly when used alongside psychological therapies. While discussing body image (Option E) is also an important aspect of treatment, the question focuses on what is correct to state about treatment, and fluoxetine's efficacy is a well-supported fact in this context.

**Answer: F**
