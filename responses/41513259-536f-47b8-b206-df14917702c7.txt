B: 15.6 kJ or 3.7 kcal per g
C: 23.5 kJ or 5.8 kcal per g
D: 31.5 kJ or 7.5 kcal per g
E: 19.7 kJ or 4.1 kcal per g
F: 36.5 kJ or 8.1 kcal per g
G: 28.4 kJ or 6.8 kcal per g
H: 29.7 kJ or 7.1 kcal per g
I: 33.3 kJ or 7.9 kcal per g
J: 22.9 kJ or 5.5 kcal per g

Okay, so I need to figure out how many kcal are in one gram of ethanol. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that the energy content of different substances varies. Ethanol is an alcohol, and I think it has less energy compared to fats or proteins, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, I think energy content is usually measured in kilocalories (kcal) or kilojoules (kJ), and sometimes I get them confused. Oh right, 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So if I have a value in kJ, I can convert it to kcal by dividing by 4.184.

I recall that the energy content of ethanol is around 7 kcal per gram. Let me think, I've heard that carbohydrates, including alcohols like ethanol, have about 4 kcal per gram, but wait, ethanol is different because it's an alcohol. Oh, right, I think ethanol actually has a bit more than that. Maybe around 7 kcal per gram.

Looking at the options, I see options that have kcal values ranging from 3.7 up to 9.0. So the correct answer should be around 7 kcal. Let me check each option:

Option A: 9.0 kcal. That seems a bit high. I think that's more like the energy content of something like protein or maybe some other substance, but not ethanol.

Option B: 3.7 kcal. That's too low. I think that's more like carbohydrates, but ethanol should be higher than that.

Option C: 5.8 kcal. Hmm, closer, but I still think it's a bit low.

Option D: 7.5 kcal. That sounds about right. I've heard ethanol is around 7 kcal per gram.

Option E: 4.1 kcal. No, that's probably for carbs.

Option F: 8.1 kcal. A bit higher than what I remember, but not too far off.

Option G: 6.8 kcal. Closer, but I think it's a bit lower than 7.

Option H: 7.1 kcal. That's very close to what I thought.

Option I: 7.9 kcal. Hmm, maybe a bit high, but possible.

Option J: 5.5 kcal. No, that's too low.

Wait, I'm a bit confused now. I've heard different numbers before. Which is more accurate? Let me think about sources. I remember that in food energy terms, ethanol doesn't contribute much because the body doesn't break it down into other energy sources like glucose. But when considering pure ethanol, I think the energy content is around 7 kcal per gram.

Looking at the options, both H and D are close. H is 7.1 and D is 7.5. Which one is more accurate? I'm trying to remember. I think the standard value is about 7 kcal per gram for ethanol. So 7.1 would be more precise. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the kJ values. If the kcal is 7.1, then kJ would be 7.1 * 4.184 â‰ˆ 29.7 kJ. Looking at the options, option H is 29.7 kJ or 7.1 kcal. That matches up. So option H seems correct.

The energy content of ethanol is approximately 7 kcal per gram. Converting this to kilojoules gives around 29.7 kJ. Among the options, option H matches this value, with 29.7 kJ or 7.1 kcal per gram.

Answer: H
