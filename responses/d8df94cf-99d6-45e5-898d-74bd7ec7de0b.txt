Okay, so I've got this question about Angelman syndrome, and I'm a bit rusty on my genetics, but let me try to work through it. I remember that Angelman syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder, and it's related to some genetic issues, probably involving chromosome 15 or 16? Hmm, wait, I think it's chromosome 15. But I'm not entirely sure.

The question is asking which of the options would result in Angelman syndrome. The options are A through G, and each involves different genetic scenarios. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Paternal UPD 16. UPD stands for Uniparental Disomy, which means both copies of a chromosome come from one parent instead of one from each. So if it's paternal UPD 16, the child gets two copies of chromosome 16 from the father. I think UPD is associated with some imprinting disorders. But which ones? I remember that maternal UPD 16 can cause something called Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. So maybe paternal UPD 16 is different. I'm not sure if that's linked to Angelman.

Option B: Maternal UPD 16. As I thought earlier, maternal UPD 16 is associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann, which is a growth disorder. So probably not Angelman.

Option C: A mutation in the SNRPN gene. SNRPN... that sounds familiar. I think SNRPN is a gene on chromosome 15, and it's involved in the Prader-Willi/Angelman region. Wait, Prader-Willi and Angelman are both caused by issues in chromosome 15, and they're often called sister syndromes because they affect the same region but different genes. I believe Prader-Willi is usually due to a deletion on the paternal chromosome 15, while Angelman is due to a maternal deletion or a mutation in the UBE3A gene, which is also on 15. But SNRPN is another gene... perhaps it's involved in the Prader-Willi side? Or maybe in Angelman? I'm a bit confused here.

Option D: Deletion in the maternally derived chromosome 16. Wait, Angelman is usually linked to chromosome 15, not 16. So maybe this is incorrect. Or is it possible that sometimes it's on 16? No, I think the main cause is chromosome 15. So probably D isn't right.

Option E: Deletion in the paternally derived chromosome 15. Oh, right! Because Angelman is usually caused by a deletion on the maternal chromosome 15. Wait, noâ€”wait, no, actually, wait. I think Prader-Willi is when there's a deletion on the paternal chromosome 15, and Angelman is when there's a deletion on the maternal chromosome 15. Because each parent contributes different imprints. So if it's a deletion in the paternal chromosome 15, that would be Prader-Willi, not Angelman. So E is probably not the answer.

Option F: A mutation in the SNRPN promoter. SNRPN promoter... I think the SNRPN gene is involved in the Prader-Willi region. If there's a mutation in the promoter, maybe that affects the expression, but I'm not sure how that ties into Angelman. Alternatively, Angelman is more linked to the UBE3A gene. So maybe F isn't the right answer.

Option G: Paternal UPD 15. UPD 15 from the father. So the child has two copies of chromosome 15 from the father. I think UPD 15 can cause issues like Prader-Willi or other syndromes. But in the context of Angelman, I'm not sure. Wait, if a child has UPD 15, they might not have the maternal or paternal imprints correctly. So if the mother's chromosome 15 has the active imprints, but the child gets two paternal copies, that might lead to Angelman? Or is it the opposite? I'm getting myself confused.

Wait, let me think again. Angelman syndrome typically occurs when there's a deletion or inactivation of the maternal chromosome 15, specifically the UBE3A gene. So the maternal chromosome 15 is missing or not working, so the paternal copy isn't enough because it's imprinted. Alternatively, sometimes it's due to a mutation in the UBE3A gene on the maternal chromosome.

In the options given, I don't see any mention of UBE3A. So looking back, option C is a mutation in SNRPN. SNRPN is a gene on chromosome 15 but is part of the imprinted cluster. I think SNRPN is paternally expressed. So a mutation in SNRPN could lead to issues with paternal expression. But how does that tie into Angelman?

Wait, Angelman is usually maternal in origin, right? Because the UBE3A gene is on the maternal chromosome. So if the maternal chromosome has a deletion, the child can't get the maternal copy working, so they rely on the paternal, but paternal UBE3A isn't expressed in the same way.

Alternatively, if the child has UPD 15 from the father, meaning they have two paternal copies, then the imprints might be different. But I'm not sure if that would cause Angelman.

Another thought: I remember reading that Angelman can be caused by several mechanisms, including deletion of the maternal 15q11-q13 region, which includes the UBE3A gene, or by a mutation in the UBE3A gene itself, or by imprinting defects where the maternal chromosome is not properly imprinted. So, looking at the options, none mention UBE3A. So maybe the correct answer is one of the UPD options.

Wait, UPD 15, paternal (option G). So if a child has two paternal copies, that would mean that the maternal copy isn't there. But wait, the child should have one from each parent. Oh, wait, UPD means both chromosomes come from one parent. So option G is paternal UPD 15: the child has two copies of chromosome 15 from the father. In this case, the mother's contribution is missing, so the child has two paternal chromosomes. Now, imprinting is parent-specific, so if the maternal chromosome 15 is the one that's supposed to be active for certain genes, but it's missing, then the child's cells would have only paternal chromosome 15, which is imprinted differently. So for genes that require the maternal allele, like UBE3A, the child wouldn't have that active copy. So that might lead to Angelman.

Because Angelman is caused by lack of maternal UBE3A, either through deletion or through imprinting issues. So if the child has UPD 15, paternal, that means the maternal chromosome 15 isn't present (or is not contributing), leading to the same effect as a deletion of the maternal chromosome. So option G: Paternal UPD 15 would result in Angelman syndrome.

Wait, but I thought UPD 15 is more associated with Prader-Willi. Let me confirm. Prader-Willi is usually caused by a deletion on the paternal chromosome 15, or by UPD 15 (maternal). Because if you have UPD 15 from the mother, then the child lacks the paternal chromosome 15, which is where the Prader-Willi genes are located. So maternal UPD 15 causes Prader-Willi because the child has two maternal copies and no paternal. Conversely, paternal UPD 15 would mean the child has two paternal copies, which might lead to Angelman because the maternal chromosome is missing, and that's where the UBE3A is needed.

So in that case, option G would be the correct answer. So the answer is G.

The correct answer is G: Paternal UPD 15.

Angelman syndrome is typically caused by a deletion or inactivation of the maternal chromosome 15, specifically affecting the UBE3A gene. However, other genetic mechanisms can also lead to the disorder. Paternal UPD 15 occurs when a child inherits both copies of chromosome 15 from the father, resulting in the absence of the maternal chromosome 15. Since the maternal chromosome is the one that normally contributes the active UBE3A gene, its absence due to UPD 15 can lead to Angelman syndrome. This aligns with the genetic mechanisms underlying the disorder.
