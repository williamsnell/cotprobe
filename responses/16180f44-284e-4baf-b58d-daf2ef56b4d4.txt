Okay, so I've got this question about organizational culture and specifically about workers' acceptance of change. The question is asking which type of culture is characterized by workers accepting change. The options are A through G, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I should probably recall what each of these cultures entails. I remember that organizational culture refers to the shared values, beliefs, and practices within a company. Different cultures can influence how employees behave, interact, and respond to changes.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Process culture. I think a process culture focuses on efficiency, standardization, and following procedures. People in such environments might be resistant to change because they rely heavily on established processes. So if change is introduced, it might disrupt their usual way of doing things, making them less likely to accept it. So probably not A.

Option B: Hierarchical culture. This is where there's a clear chain of command, and decisions are made by those at the top. Employees might be less likely to accept change because they're used to following orders from above without much input. Plus, the structure is rigid, so change could be seen as a threat. So maybe not B.

Option C: Power culture. This is similar to hierarchical but more about power dynamics. The culture is driven by the people in power, and others might feel less empowered to make changes. Again, this might lead to resistance to change because employees aren't as involved in decision-making. So C might not be it either.

Option D: Competitive culture. In a competitive environment, employees are focused on winning, beating others, and achieving individual goals. While competition can drive performance, it might not necessarily foster acceptance of change because the focus is on individual success rather than adaptability. So D could be a possibility, but I'm not sure.

Option E: Collaborative culture. This is where teamwork and cooperation are key. People work together to achieve common goals. In such a culture, I think employees might be more open to change because collaboration often involves sharing ideas and being flexible. Change is seen as a team effort, so they might be more accepting. E seems like a strong candidate.

Option F: Individualistic culture. Here, the focus is on individual achievements rather than the group. People might be more self-reliant and perhaps more open to change if it benefits them personally. But I'm not sure if this is the best fit because individualism can sometimes lead to less concern for the broader organizational change. So maybe not F.

Option G: Task culture. This culture is task-oriented, where the focus is on completing specific tasks efficiently. People are usually brought together for the purpose of achieving a particular goal. In such a culture, change might be accepted if it helps in completing tasks more effectively. However, task cultures can sometimes be short-term and less focused on long-term adaptability. So G might not be the best fit.

Now, considering all of these, the key is workers' acceptance of change. Which culture is known for embracing change? Collaborative cultures, I think, because collaboration often involves teamwork and adaptability. When people work together, they can more easily adapt to changes because they're used to sharing ideas and working towards common goals. In a collaborative environment, change is seen as a group effort, making it more acceptable to employees.

So putting it all together, the answer should be E: Collaborative culture.
