Question:

 Which of the given formulas of PL is the best symbolization of the following sentence?

Options:

A: (E ⊃ F) ∨ ~(S ≡ C)
B: (E ⊃ F) ∨ (S ⊃ C)
C: (E ⊃ F) ∨ (~C ⊃ S)
D: (E ⊃ F) ∨ (~S ≡ C)
E: (E ⊃ F) ∨ ~(C ≡ ~S)
F: (E ⊃ F) ∨ (C ⊃ ~S)
G: (F ⊃ E) ∨ (C ≡ S)
H: (F ⊃ E) ∨ (S ⊃ ~C
I: (E ⊃ F) ∨ (~C ≡ S)
J: ~(E ⊃ F) ∨ (C ≡ S)

Okay, so I need to figure out which of the given formulas correctly symbolizes the sentence: "Either England's importing beef is a sufficient condition for France's subsidizing agriculture, or China doesn't promote human rights when and only when South Africa supplies diamonds."

Let me break this down step by step. First, I'll try to understand the structure of the sentence. It seems to be an OR statement connecting two different propositions.

The first part is "England's importing beef is a sufficient condition for France's subsidizing agriculture." In logic, a sufficient condition is represented by the implication E → F, where E is "England imports beef" and F is "France subsidizes agriculture." So that part is clear: E → F.

The second part is a bit trickier: "China doesn't promote human rights when and only when South Africa supplies diamonds." Let me parse this. The phrase "when and only when" suggests a biconditional relationship. So, "China promotes human rights if and only if South Africa supplies diamonds." But the sentence says "doesn't promote," so I need to negate that.

Let me define the variables more precisely. Let C be "China promotes human rights," and S be "South Africa supplies diamonds." The statement says that China doesn't promote human rights if and only if South Africa supplies diamonds. Wait, no, actually, the structure is "China doesn't promote human rights when and only when S." So it's saying that China's not promoting human rights is equivalent to S. So, ~C ≡ S.

Wait, let me make sure. The original part is "China doesn't promote human rights when and only when South Africa supplies diamonds." So, China not promoting (¬C) happens exactly when S happens. So that's ¬C ↔ S. Alternatively, we can write this as S ↔ ¬C, but since biconditional is symmetric, it doesn't matter.

So the second part is ~C ≡ S, which is the same as S ≡ ~C.

Now, the entire sentence is "Either E → F, or ~C ≡ S." So in logical terms, that's (E → F) ∨ (~C ≡ S).

Looking at the options:

Option I is: (E ⊃ F) ∨ (~C ≡ S). That matches exactly what I derived.

Wait, let me check the other options just to be sure. Option A is (E→F) ∨ ~ (S ≡ C). That would mean either E→F or it's not the case that S and C are equivalent. But the original sentence is about ~C being equivalent to S, not the negation of S≡C. So A is not correct.

Option I correctly captures both parts: E→F OR ~C≡S. So the answer should be I.

The correct formula is (E → F) ∨ (~C ≡ S), which corresponds to option I.

Answer: I
