Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about statistics and machine learning concepts. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question has two statements, and I need to determine the truth of each. Then, based on that, I'll select the correct option from A to J.

**Statement 1:** Linear regression estimator has the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators.

Hmm, I remember something about the Gauss-Markov theorem. As I recall, the Gauss-Markov theorem states that, under certain assumptions (like linearity, no multicollinearity, etc.), the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator in linear regression is the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE). "Best" here means it has the smallest variance among all unbiased linear estimators. So, if the conditions hold, the linear regression estimator does have the smallest variance among all unbiased ones. But wait, the statement says "among all unbiased estimators," not just linear ones. Oh right, because the theorem specifically refers to linear estimators. So if we consider all possible unbiased estimators (not necessarily linear), there might be others with smaller variance. But wait, no, because when you're talking about linear regression, the estimators are linear. So maybe the statement is only true when considering linear estimators. But the statement doesn't specify, which could be a problem. So, is the statement always true?

Wait, the statement says "has the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators." If it's considering all possible unbiased estimators, regardless of being linear or not, then the OLS estimator isn't necessarily the one with the smallest variance. Because, for example, in some cases, a non-linear estimator could have a smaller variance. But I think in the context of linear regression, the estimators we're considering are linear. So maybe the statement is correct under the assumption of linear estimators. But the statement doesn't specify that, so it's a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, maybe the statement is incorrect because it's not always the case. For example, if the model is misspecified or if certain Gauss-Markov assumptions aren't met (like heteroscedasticity), the OLS estimator might not even be BLUE. So the variance might not be the smallest in those cases. Therefore, the statement might not always hold true. So Statement 1 is sometimes true, depending on the conditions.

**Statement 2:** The coefficients α assigned to the classifiers assembled by AdaBoost are always non-negative.

I remember that AdaBoost works by assigning weights to each classifier, and these weights (α) are calculated in a way that they can be positive or negative. But wait, no, I think the coefficients α are always non-negative. Because in AdaBoost, each base classifier is either added or subtracted based on its performance. Wait, no, actually, the coefficients can be positive or negative. Let me think again.

In AdaBoost, the weight α for each classifier is determined by the algorithm. If a classifier is performing well, it gets a higher weight. But the exact formula for α can result in positive or negative values, depending on the performance of the classifier. Wait, no, I think the α values are always non-negative because they represent the importance of each classifier in the ensemble, and you can't have negative importance in the way AdaBoost works. Or do they?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me recall. The AdaBoost algorithm computes α as part of the exponential loss minimization. The formula is α = (1/2) * ln((1 - ε)/ε), where ε is the error rate of the classifier. If ε < 0.5, then (1 - ε)/ε >1, so ln of that is positive, making α positive. If ε >0.5, then (1 - ε)/ε <1, so ln is negative, which would make α negative. Oh, so α can be negative. So the coefficients can be positive or negative, depending on the error rate of the classifier. Therefore, Statement 2 is false because the coefficients are not always non-negative.

Wait, but the statement says "always non-negative." Since sometimes α can be negative, the statement is false.

So, putting it together:

Statement 1: Sometimes true (depends on assumptions)
Statement 2: False

Now, looking at the options:

Options are pairs (Statement1, Statement2). So:

A: Statement1 sometimes true, Statement2 false → (S1: sometimes true, S2: False)
B: S1 True, S2 sometimes true
C: Both false
D: S1 false, S2 true
E: Both sometimes true
F: Both partially true
G: S1 sometimes false, S2 sometimes false
H: S1 sometimes false, S2 true
I: Both true
J: S1 true, S2 false

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me check the options again.

Looking back, the options are:

A: Statement 1 sometimes true, Statement 2 false → So S1 is sometimes true, S2 is false. So S1 is not always true, so the first statement is sometimes true (which would make the option A correct if that's the case).

Wait, but earlier I thought S1 is only true under certain conditions (like when the Gauss-Markov assumptions hold). So S1 is not always true, making the statement sometimes true.

But for the first statement, the question is whether it's true that the linear regression estimator has the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators. Since in reality, it's the smallest among linear unbiased estimators, but not necessarily all. So the statement as given is incorrect because it's not considering all possible unbiased estimators, which could include non-linear ones that might have smaller variance. Therefore, the first statement is false because it's not universally true.

Wait, now I'm getting more confused. Let me clarify:

Gauss-Markov theorem says that OLS is BLUE, meaning it's the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator. So among all linear unbiased estimators, OLS has the smallest variance. But if we consider all possible unbiased estimators (including non-linear ones), then OLS may not have the smallest variance. So the first statement is incorrect because it says "among all unbiased estimators," which includes non-linear ones. Therefore, the first statement is false.

So Statement 1 is false. Statement 2 is also false because the coefficients can be negative.

So both statements are false. So looking at the options:

Option C: False, False → So the answer would be C.

Wait, but earlier I thought Statement 2 is false, so let's confirm.

Yes, because AdaBoost's α can be negative, as when the error rate ε is greater than 0.5, α would be negative. So Statement 2 is false.

So both statements are false, so the answer is C.
</think>

The first statement is false because the linear regression estimator (OLS) only has the smallest variance among linear unbiased estimators, not all unbiased estimators. The second statement is also false because AdaBoost's coefficients α can be negative. 

Answer: C
