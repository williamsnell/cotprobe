Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the access matrix approach to protection. I remember that access matrices are used in computer security to represent who has access to what resources. Let me think through each option to figure out which one correctly identifies the difficulty with this approach.

The question is asking about the difficulty or problem with the access matrix approach. I'll go through each option one by one.

Option A: It requires an extensive amount of computational power. Hmm, I don't recall that being the main issue. Access matrices are more about representation than heavy computation. Maybe not A.

Option B: It is not capable of expressing complex protection requirements. Wait, access matrices are pretty detailed, right? They can show each subject and object, so they can handle complex requirements. I don't think B is correct.

Option C: The matrix, if stored directly, is large and can be clumsy to manage. That sounds familiar. I remember reading that access matrices can become very large, especially in systems with many subjects and resources, making them hard to manage. So C is a possible correct answer.

Option D: The matrix cannot be modified once it is created. No, access matrices can be updated as needed, like when a user's permissions change. So D isn't the issue.

Option E: It does not allow for the sharing of resources between processes. I'm not sure about this. The matrix should allow for sharing by having appropriate entries. So E might not be the problem.

Option F: There's no way to express who has rights to change the access matrix itself. That's interesting. In some models, there might not be a way to control who can modify the matrix, which could be a security issue. But I'm not certain if this is the main difficulty.

Option G: It does not provide sufficient protection against external threats. The access matrix is more about internal access control, so maybe it's not great against external threats, but I'm not sure if that's the main problem.

Option H: There is no way to express the hierarchy of access rights within the matrix. I think access matrices can represent hierarchies through entries, so H might not be correct.

Option I: Deciding whether a process has access is undecidable. That doesn't make sense. The matrix is designed to make access decisions clear, so I don't think I is right.

Option J: The matrix, if not stored directly, can cause system failure. I don't recall this being an issue. Maybe if it's not stored, but I'm not sure. It seems less likely.

Now, considering all options, the main issue I remember is that the access matrix can become very large and difficult to manage directly. So the correct answer should be C.
