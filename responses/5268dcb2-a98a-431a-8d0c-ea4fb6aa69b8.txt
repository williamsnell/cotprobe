Okay, so I have this question about the Social Security Act in 1935 and how many Americans were in favor of it. The options are A through J, with different percentages. I need to figure out which one is correct. 

First, I remember that the Social Security Act was part of the New Deal, which was Franklin D. Roosevelt's response to the Great Depression. The New Deal was a series of programs and reforms aimed at providing relief, recovery, and reform. Social Security was one of the key components, designed to provide financial assistance to the elderly, unemployed, and others.

Now, considering the time period, 1935, the country was still reeling from the economic crisis. People were really suffering, so I think there was a strong support for such programs. But I'm not exactly sure about the exact percentage. 

I think about public opinion during that time. Roosevelt was quite popular, especially with his initial programs. The First New Deal had some support, but there was also some opposition, particularly from business interests. However, the Second New Deal, which included Social Security, was more progressive and had more public backing.

I recall that when the Social Security Act was proposed, there was a lot of support from the general public, but maybe not everyone. Some businesses didn't like it because they had to contribute, and maybe some people were skeptical about government involvement. But overall, I think the majority supported it.

Looking at the options, J is 50%, which might be too low. I think the support was higher. Option I is 70%, which seems plausible. Option G is 80%, which is quite high, but I'm not sure if it was that high. Option C is 60%, which is also possible.

Wait, I think I read somewhere that when the Social Security Act was passed, it had significant support. Maybe around 60-70% of the population was in favor. So between C, I, and maybe G.

Alternatively, I might be confusing it with the approval ratings of Roosevelt himself. He was very popular, but that doesn't directly translate to support for every specific act. But since the act was part of his agenda and the public was desperate for solutions, the support was likely high.

I think the correct percentage is around 60-70%. So looking at the options, C is 60%, I is 70%. Which one is it? I'm a bit unsure. Maybe I should think about the historical context more.

In 1935, the unemployment rate was still high, but the New Deal had already started some programs. The Social Security Act was a major part of it. Public opinion polls at the time, if any existed, would show support. I think the majority was in favor, maybe over 60%.

Wait, another angle: the opposition was mainly from big business and some conservative groups, but the average American probably supported it. So 60% or 70% sounds right. I think I've heard that around 60-70% supported it.

So between C (60%) and I (70%). I'm leaning towards 60% because maybe not everyone was on board, but a large majority. Or maybe it's higher. Alternatively, I might have to guess.

Wait, I think the correct answer is around 60%, so option C. But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, I might have read that it had majority support, over 70%. Hmm.

I think I'll go with 60%, so option C.

The Social Security Act of 1935 was part of the New Deal, which had significant public support. While not everyone was in favor, a majority of Americans backed it. Considering the options, 60% is a plausible estimate.

Answer: C
