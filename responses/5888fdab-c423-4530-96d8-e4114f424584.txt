Okay, so I have this question about the scientific characteristics of psychology, and I need to pick the correct answer from options A to J. Let me think through this.

First, I remember that psychology is a science, but I'm not exactly sure which kind. I think it's more about human behavior and the mind. So, is it a natural science or something else? Natural sciences like physics and chemistry deal with inanimate objects, right? Option A says psychology is a natural science focusing on inanimate objects, which doesn't sound right because psychology is about living beings, especially humans.

Option B says psychology is based on intuition and opinion. Wait, no, that can't be right. Science relies on evidence and data, not just feelings or opinions. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C claims psychology isn't empirical. Empirical means based on observation or experiment. But I know that psychological studies are based on empirical data, so C is wrong.

Option D says psychology is empirical, systematic, and uses measurement techniques. That sounds familiar. I remember that psychological research involves experiments and measurements, so D seems correct.

E says psychology uses random observation without replication. No, scientific methods require systematic approaches and replication to validate results. So E is wrong.

F claims psychology only studies group behavior and ignores individuals. That's not true because a lot of psychology, especially clinical and developmental, focuses on individuals.

G says psychology is only about animal behavior, not humans. No, psychology definitely applies to humans, though animal behavior is a part of it.

H says psychology relies solely on theoretical approaches without experimentation. No, psychology uses both theories and experiments; you can't have one without the other in scientific research.

I suggests psychology is a pseudoscience. Pseudoscience isn't scientific, but psychology is a legitimate science, so I is incorrect.

J says psychology doesn't use measurement techniques. That's wrong because measurements are crucial, like in experiments and surveys.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be D. It accurately describes psychology as empirical, systematic, and using measurements.

The correct answer is D. Psychology is empirical, systematic, and employs measurement techniques.

Answer: D
