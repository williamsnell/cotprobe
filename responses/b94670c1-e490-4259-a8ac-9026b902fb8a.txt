Okay, so I've got this question about two processors, M-5 and M-7. Both use the same instruction set, but they have different pipeline stages and clock cycles. I need to figure out which statements I, II, and III are true.

Let me start by understanding the basics. Pipeline stages and clock cycles affect both the throughput and latency of a processor. Throughput is how many instructions it can process per second, while latency is the time it takes to complete a single instruction.

M-5 has a 5-stage pipeline with a 10ns clock cycle. M-7 has a 7-stage pipeline with a 7.5ns clock cycle. 

First, let's calculate their maximum throughput. Throughput is typically the reciprocal of the cycle time, but since both are pipelined, the maximum throughput would be based on the number of stages and the clock speed. 

The formula for throughput is (number of stages) / (clock cycle time). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, the maximum throughput is determined by the number of instructions per cycle multiplied by the clock frequency. For a pipelined processor, the maximum instruction per cycle (IPC) is roughly equal to the number of pipeline stages, assuming no hazards or stalls. So, the IPC is approximately equal to the number of stages, but I might be mixing that up.

Wait, no. The IPC for a pipelined processor without any stalls is about one instruction per cycle per stage. So if a processor has a 5-stage pipeline, it can theoretically issue one instruction every clock cycle, but that's not exactly right. Actually, each stage processes a part of an instruction, so each instruction takes as many clock cycles as the number of stages. But for throughput, it's about how many instructions can be completed per second.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of cycles per instruction (CPI). CPI is the average number of clock cycles per instruction. For a pipeline with no hazards, CPI is equal to the number of stages. But that's only when the pipeline is fully utilized without any stalls.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try again. The maximum throughput is the number of instructions per second. That's (frequency) * (IPC). For M-5, the clock cycle is 10ns, so the frequency is 1/10e-9 = 100 MHz. For M-7, the clock cycle is 7.5ns, so frequency is 1/7.5e-9 ≈ 133.33 MHz.

Now, the IPC for a pipelined processor is the number of instructions that can be completed per cycle. But in a pipelined processor, each stage can process a part of an instruction, so each instruction takes as many cycles as the number of stages. Wait, no. Let me think: for a 5-stage pipeline, each instruction takes 5 cycles to complete, but each cycle can issue a new instruction. So the maximum throughput would be 1 instruction per cycle, but that's only if there are no stalls. So the IPC would be 1, but the latency per instruction is 5 cycles.

Wait, that can't be right because if each instruction takes 5 cycles, then the time per instruction is 5 * 10ns = 50ns for M-5. For M-7, each instruction takes 7 cycles, so 7 *7.5ns=52.5ns. Wait, but that would mean M-5 has lower latency per instruction than M-7. But that's just the instruction latency. But for throughput, if both can issue one instruction per clock cycle, then M-5's throughput is 100 MHz, and M-7's is about 133 MHz. So M-7 has higher throughput.

Wait, but no, because the number of stages affects the maximum throughput. Because, in a pipeline, the maximum throughput is determined by the number of stages and the clock speed. So for M-5, with 5 stages and 10ns cycle, each instruction takes 5 cycles, so the time per instruction is 50ns. But the maximum throughput is how many instructions can be started per second. Since each cycle can start a new instruction, the throughput is 100 million instructions per second (MIPS). For M-7, each instruction takes 7 cycles, 7.5ns each, so 52.5ns per instruction, but the throughput is 133.33 MIPS.

So statement I says M-7 has better maximum throughput than M-5. Yes, because 133 MIPS > 100 MIPS.

Statement II: The latency of a single instruction is shorter on M-7 than M-5. Wait, M-5's latency is 5 cycles at 10ns each, so 50ns. M-7's is 7 cycles at 7.5ns each, so 52.5ns. So M-7's latency is longer, so statement II is false.

Statement III: Programs executing on M-7 will always run faster than on M-5. Well, if M-7 has higher throughput, more instructions per second, but it's possible that some programs are latency-bound, meaning they depend on the time each instruction takes. So if a program has a lot of dependencies or requires a lot of sequential execution, it might not benefit from higher throughput. For example, if a program has a critical path where each instruction depends on the previous one, then the latency matters more. So M-7's higher latency (52.5ns vs 50ns) could make such programs run slower on M-7. Therefore, III is not necessarily true. So III is false.

So now, looking at the statements:

I: True

II: False

III: False

So the only true statement is I.

Looking at the options:

A: All three – no.

B: None – no.

C: I only – yes.

D: II only – no.

E: I and II – no, II is false.

F: I and II only – no.

G: II and III only – no.

H: II and III – no.

I: I and III – no.

J: III only – no.

So the correct answer is option C: I only.

The analysis shows that only statement I is true. M-7 has a higher maximum throughput than M-5 due to its higher clock frequency. Statement II is false because M-7 has longer instruction latency. Statement III is also false as programs dependent on instruction latency might not run faster on M-7.
