Question:

A man decided to stop at a drive-through hamburger stand for a late snack. As he drove up to the drive- through line, the manager of the hamburger stand informed him through the intercom system that the restaurant was closing and no further orders would be accepted. She told the man that the last car to be served was the one directly in front of him. The man became angry and yelled into the intercom machine, "Listen, babe, I am hungry. I want two cheeseburgers, a large order of fries, and a Coke. " The manager retorted, "I'm terribly sorry, but we cannot accept your order. "Shortly thereafter, the manager handed the food order to the passengers in the car immediately in front of the man's. When the man saw the manager serving that car, he became very angry, drove his automobile up to the service window and shouted at the manager, "You can't do this to me. " When the manager laughed, the man suddenly reached into the car's glove compartment and pulled out a gun. He aimed at the manager and fired the weapon, intending to hit her. The bullet missed the manager but hit a customer, wounding him in the head. In an action by the customer against the man for battery, the customer will be

Options:

A: successful, because the man caused harm with his actions, regardless of his intent.
B: unsuccessful, because the man was not aiming at the customer.
C: unsuccessful, because the manager could have prevented the situation by accepting the man's order.
D: successful, because the man was acting recklessly and created a dangerous situation.
E: unsuccessful, because the man could not foresee that the bullet would hit anyone other than the manager.
F: unsuccessful, because the man was provoked by the manager's refusal to serve him.
G: unsuccessful, because the man did not intend to shoot the customer.
H: successful, because there was a "substantial certainty" that the customer would be hit by the bullet.
I: successful, because the man intended to shoot the manager.
J: successful, because the bullet from the man's gun directly caused the customer's injury.

Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this legal question. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand it.

A man stops at a drive-through hamburger stand. The manager tells him it's closing and the last car in front of him is the last to be served. The man gets angry, orders food through the intercom, but the manager refuses. Then, the manager gives the last order to the car in front. The man gets even more angry, drives up, shouts, and when the manager laughs, he pulls out a gun, aims at her, and fires. The bullet misses the manager but hits a customer, wounding them in the head. The customer is suing the man for battery. The question is whether the customer will be successful in their claim.

I remember that battery is a tort which involves intentional harmful or offensive contact with another person. So, intent is a key element here. But there are different types of intent—like intent to cause the contact, or intent to commit the act that caused the contact, even if not specifically intending to harm that person.

In this case, the man aimed at the manager but missed, hitting the customer instead. So, his intent was to shoot the manager, not the customer. But does that matter for battery?

I think battery can be intentional if the defendant intended the act that caused the harm, even if they didn't specifically intend to harm that particular person. So, the man intended to pull the trigger and shoot, which caused the bullet to hit the customer. That might be enough for intent.

Looking at the options:

A: Successful because he caused harm regardless of intent. But battery requires intent, so this might not be right.

B: Unsuccessful because he wasn't aiming at the customer. But intent isn't about aiming at the specific person, just the act causing harm. So even if he aimed elsewhere, if the act was intentional and caused harm, it could still be battery.

C: Unsuccessful because the manager could have prevented it. Not sure about that. I don't think the manager's actions affect the man's liability here.

D: Successful because he acted recklessly. Recklessness is another way to establish intent for battery. If he acted with a conscious disregard for safety, that could count. But in this case, he aimed at the manager, so maybe it's more intentional.

E: Unsuccessful because he couldn't foresee hitting someone else. But foreseeability is more about whether the type of harm was foreseeable, not necessarily the specific person. So even if he didn't see the customer, the fact that firing a gun could hit someone nearby might make it foreseeable.

F: Unsuccessful because provoked. Provocation might reduce liability, but I think battery requires the provocation to be sufficient to cause a reasonable person to act. Yelling and refusing service might not be enough for provocation.

G: Unsuccessful because he didn't intend to shoot the customer. But battery doesn't require intent to harm that specific person, just intent to commit the act that caused the harm. So even if he didn't mean to hit the customer, his intent to fire the gun could be enough.

H: Successful because there was a substantial certainty the customer would be hit. This sounds like an alternative way of looking at intent—whether the man was substantially certain his actions would result in contact. If he aimed in a crowded area, perhaps, but in this case, he aimed at the manager, but the area might have been such that the bullet could hit others.

I: Successful because he intended to shoot the manager. Well, yes, he intended to shoot her, but battery against the customer isn't about his intent towards the manager. It's about his intent causing harm to the customer.

J: Successful because the bullet caused the injury. This seems to focus on causation, but battery requires both intent and causation. The man's intent was to shoot, so the bullet hitting the customer would satisfy both.

Wait, so the key is whether the man's act was intentional. He intended to pull the trigger and shoot the manager. The fact that the bullet hit the customer instead doesn't change the intent. So the battery is intentional because he intended the act that caused the contact (firing the gun), even if he didn't intend to hit the customer.

So looking at the options, D and H talk about recklessness or substantial certainty. But if he intended to shoot, that's intentional, not just reckless. So D might not apply because it's more about recklessness.

Options A and J: A says it's successful regardless of intent, but that's not right because intent is required. J says it's successful because the bullet directly caused the injury. But I think J is correct because it's about the direct cause and the intent to fire.

Wait, but in battery, the intent is to cause harmful contact. Firing a gun in a place where someone is likely to be, even if you aim elsewhere, can be considered intentional if you intended the act. So yes, J seems correct because the bullet directly caused the injury, and the intent to fire was present.

Alternatively, option I says he intended to shoot the manager, but that's about the intent towards the manager, not the customer. The customer's claim is about their own injury, so the focus is on whether the man intended the act that caused their harm.

So the correct answer would be J: successful because the bullet directly caused the injury, and he intended the act of shooting, which led to the contact.
</think>

The man intentionally fired a gun, aiming at the manager, which resulted in a bullet hitting the customer. Battery requires intentional act causing harmful contact, regardless of intent towards the specific person. The man's intent to shoot caused the injury, satisfying battery elements.
