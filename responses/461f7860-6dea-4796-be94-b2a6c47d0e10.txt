Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the question is about a TV's dimensions. The customer is confused whether the 48-inch measurement is the horizontal length or the diagonal. We need to find out how much shorter the horizontal length would be if it's measured along the diagonal instead of the horizontal.

First, I remember that TV sizes are usually given as the diagonal length. But here, the customer is considering both possibilities. So, the TV's ratio of length to height is 5:3. That means if the length is 5 parts, the height is 3 parts.

I think I should set up variables. Let me denote the length as 5x and the height as 3x, where x is a common multiplier. Now, the diagonal of the TV screen would form a right triangle with the length and height. So, using the Pythagorean theorem, the diagonal squared equals the length squared plus the height squared.

So, diagonal² = (5x)² + (3x)². The diagonal is given as 48 inches. So, plugging that in: 48² = (25x²) + (9x²) = 34x².

Wait, let me calculate that again. 5 squared is 25, and 3 squared is 9. Adding them gives 34. So, 34x² = 48². 48 squared is 2304. So, 34x² = 2304. To find x², I divide both sides by 34. x² = 2304 / 34. Let me compute that: 2304 ÷ 34. Hmm, 34 times 67 is 2278, and 34 times 68 is 2312. Oh, so 2304 is between 67 and 68. Let me do the exact division: 2304 ÷ 34. 34 goes into 230 four times (34*6=204, wait, no, 34*6 is 204, but I think I made a mistake here. Wait, 34*6=204, but 34*67=34*(60+7)=2040+238=2278. So, 2278 + 34 = 2312, which is 68. So, 2304 - 2278 is 26, so x² = 67 + 26/34, which simplifies to 67 + 13/17, so approximately 67.7647. But maybe I should just calculate it numerically. 2304 ÷ 34 equals approximately 67.7647. So x² is about 67.7647, so x is the square root of that. Let me calculate sqrt(67.7647). Well, 8 squared is 64, 8.2 squared is 67.24, 8.3 squared is 68.89. So, sqrt(67.7647) is around 8.23 inches. So x ≈ 8.23.

Now, the length is 5x. So 5 * 8.23 ≈ 41.15 inches. The height is 3x ≈ 24.69 inches.

Wait, but the problem says that the TV is 48 inches. But if the diagonal is 48, then the horizontal length (which is 5x) is 41.15 inches. But the question is asking how much shorter the horizontal length would be if measured along the diagonal rather than the horizontal. Wait, but I'm getting confused here.

Wait, no, the TV's advertised size is 48 inches, which is the diagonal. The customer is unsure whether it's the horizontal length or the diagonal. So, the question is, if the 48-inch measure is the horizontal length, how much shorter would the actual horizontal length be when measured along the diagonal? Or wait, no—wait, the question is phrased as: the customer is not certain if the advertised 48-inch width is along the horizontal or the diagonal. So, we have two scenarios: one where the 48 is the horizontal length, and another where it's the diagonal.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because TVs are typically measured diagonally. So, perhaps the problem is assuming that the 48-inch is either the horizontal length or the diagonal, and we need to find the difference in the horizontal length between the two cases.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the question again.

The question says: "how much shorter, to the nearest inch, will the horizontal length of the television screen be if the measure is made along the diagonal of the television screen rather than along the horizontal length?"

So, when the measure is along the diagonal, the horizontal length is shorter than when it's measured as the horizontal length. So, the customer is considering two possibilities: the 48 inches is the horizontal length, or the diagonal. So, we need to compute the horizontal length in both cases and find the difference.

Wait, but that's not possible because the TV can't have the same 48-inch measure for both the horizontal and the diagonal. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the TV's advertised width is 48 inches, but the customer is unsure whether that refers to the horizontal length or the diagonal. So, if the 48 inches is the horizontal length, then the diagonal would be longer. Alternatively, if the 48 inches is the diagonal, then the horizontal length would be shorter. The question is asking how much shorter the horizontal length would be if it's measured along the diagonal (i.e., the actual horizontal length is less than 48 inches) compared to if it were measured along the horizontal.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me clarify.

Scenario 1: The 48-inch measurement is the horizontal length. So, length (L) = 48 inches. The aspect ratio is 5:3, so L:H =5:3. Therefore, H = (3/5)*48 = 28.8 inches.

Then, the diagonal (D) would be sqrt(L² + H²) = sqrt(48² + 28.8²). Let me compute that: 48 squared is 2304. 28.8 squared is 829.44. Adding them gives 3133.44. The square root of 3133.44 is approximately 56 inches.

Scenario 2: The 48-inch measurement is the diagonal. So, D =48 inches. Using the aspect ratio 5:3, we can find L and H. Let L=5x, H=3x. Then, D² = (5x)² + (3x)² =25x² +9x²=34x². So, 34x² =48²=2304. x²=2304/34 ≈67.7647. x≈8.23. Therefore, L=5x≈41.15 inches.

Now, the question is asking how much shorter the horizontal length (L) is when measured along the diagonal (i.e., scenario 2) compared to when it's measured along the horizontal (i.e., scenario 1). So, in scenario 1, L is 48 inches, and in scenario 2, L is approximately 41.15 inches. The difference is 48 - 41.15 =6.85 inches. Rounding to the nearest inch, that's 7 inches. So, the horizontal length is 7 inches shorter when measured along the diagonal (i.e., the actual TV's horizontal length is shorter than 48 inches by 7 inches).

Wait, but wait. The question is phrased as: "how much shorter... will the horizontal length... be if the measure is made along the diagonal... rather than along the horizontal." So, if the measure is along the diagonal, the horizontal length is shorter than if it were measured as the horizontal. So, the difference is 7 inches. So, the answer should be 7 inches, which is option H.

Wait, but the options are A to J, with H being 7. So, the answer is H:7.

The problem involves determining how much shorter the horizontal length of a 48-inch television screen is when measured along the diagonal compared to when it's measured along the horizontal. The aspect ratio of the television is 5:3.

First, consider the two scenarios:

1. **When the 48-inch measurement is the horizontal length (L):**
   - Using the aspect ratio \( \frac{L}{H} = \frac{5}{3} \), the height \( H \) is calculated as:
     \[
     H = \frac{3}{5} \times 48 = 28.8 \text{ inches}.
     \]
   - The diagonal \( D \) is then found using the Pythagorean theorem:
     \[
     D = \sqrt{L^2 + H^2} = \sqrt{48^2 + 28.8^2} \approx 56 \text{ inches}.
     \]

2. **When the 48-inch measurement is the diagonal (D):**
   - Let \( L = 5x \) and \( H = 3x \). Using the Pythagorean theorem:
     \[
     D^2 = (5x)^2 + (3x)^2 = 34x^2.
     \]
     Substituting \( D = 48 \):
     \[
     34x^2 = 48^2 \implies x^2 = \frac{2304}{34} \approx 67.7647 \implies x \approx 8.23.
     \]
   - The horizontal length \( L \) is:
     \[
     L = 5x \approx 5 \times 8.23 = 41.15 \text{ inches}.
     \]

The difference in the horizontal length between the two scenarios is:
\[
48 - 41.15 \approx 6.85 \text{ inches}.
\]
Rounding to the nearest inch, the horizontal length is shorter by 7 inches when measured along the diagonal.
