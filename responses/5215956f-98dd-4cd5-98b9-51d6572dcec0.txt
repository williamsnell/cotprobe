Question:

Suppose the FED buys $100,000 of government bonds from a commercial bank. What will be the effect of this purchase on the money supply, if the re-quired reserve ratio is 10%, if banks maintain no excess reserves, and if there is no change in the public's currency holdings?

Options:

A: $81,000
B: $720,000
C: $1,100,000
D: $250,000
E: $90,000
F: $900,000
G: $1,000,000
H: $100,000
I: $500,000
J: $110,000

Okay, so I've got this question about the Federal Reserve buying government bonds, and I need to figure out how it affects the money supply. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but let's try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question says the FED buys $100,000 of government bonds from a commercial bank. The required reserve ratio is 10%, and banks don't keep any excess reserves. Also, the public's currency holdings aren't changing. I think this is about the money multiplier effect, right?

Wait, so when the Fed buys bonds, it's essentially increasing the money supply through open market operations. The Fed pays for the bonds by crediting the bank's reserve account. So the bank now has more reserves. Since the required reserve ratio is 10%, that means for every dollar of reserves, the bank can create up to $10 in deposits, because 1/0.10 = 10.

But wait, the Fed bought $100,000 in bonds. So the bank's reserves increase by $100,000. Now, with the required reserve ratio at 10%, the money multiplier is 1/0.10 = 10. So the initial increase in reserves leads to an increase in deposits (which is part of the money supply) by 10 times that amount.

So, the money supply should increase by $100,000 multiplied by 10, which is $1,000,000. But wait, is that correct? Or does the initial purchase itself count as part of the money supply?

Wait, the money supply includes both currency and bank deposits. In this case, the Fed's purchase adds to the bank's reserves, which in turn allows the bank to lend out more. So the initial $100k goes into the reserves, and from there, the bank can lend out up to $900k (since 10% is kept as reserves). Wait, no, that's not right. The money multiplier is 10, so the total change in deposits would be 10 times the initial reserve increase.

So, the initial reserve increase is $100k. The total increase in deposits is $100k * 10 = $1,000,000. But wait, when the Fed buys the bond, it's adding $100k to the bank's reserves, which allows the bank to make more loans. Each time the bank makes a loan, that money becomes part of someone else's deposits, and the cycle continues.

But let me think again. The formula for the money multiplier is 1 / r, where r is the reserve ratio. So here, r is 0.10, so the multiplier is 10. The initial change in reserves is $100k, so the total change in money supply is 10 * 100k = $1,000,000.

Wait, but sometimes I've heard that the total money supply change is the initial amount times the multiplier. So in this case, it's $100k *10= $1,000,000. That would mean the money supply increases by $1,000,000.

Looking at the options, option G is $1,000,000. So I think that's the correct answer. But wait, let me double-check.

Another way to think about it: when the Fed buys bonds, it's injecting money into the banking system. The banks now have more reserves, so they can lend more. Each dollar of new reserves allows the banks to create up to $10 in deposits. So the total increase is $100k *10= $1,000,000.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer should be G, $1,000,000.

The Federal Reserve's purchase of $100,000 in government bonds increases the commercial bank's reserves by $100,000. With a required reserve ratio of 10%, the money multiplier is 10 (1/0.10). This means the bank can create up to $1,000,000 in deposits, leading to a $1,000,000 increase in the money supply.

Answer: G
