Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question is asking for the sum of all positive integer values of n such that n squared is a factor of 1200. The options are A through J, with numbers ranging from 45 down to 36. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I remember that if n squared is a factor of 1200, then n squared must divide 1200 without leaving a remainder. So, n² | 1200. That means that n² is one of the factors of 1200, but it's specifically a square factor because it's n squared.

So, to find all such n, I should probably find all the square factors of 1200 and then take their square roots to find n. Once I have all those n's, I can add them up.

Let me start by factoring 1200 into its prime factors. I think the prime factorization approach is the way to go here. Let's do that.

1200. Let's divide by 2 first. 1200 ÷ 2 = 600. Again by 2: 600 ÷ 2 = 300. Again: 300 ÷ 2 = 150. Again: 150 ÷ 2 = 75. Now, 75 isn't divisible by 2, so let's move to the next prime, which is 3. 75 ÷ 3 = 25. Now, 25 is divisible by 5: 25 ÷ 5 = 5, and then 5 ÷ 5 = 1. So, putting it all together, the prime factors are 2⁴ × 3¹ × 5².

So, 1200 = 2⁴ × 3¹ × 5².

Now, for a number to be a square factor of 1200, its prime exponents must be even and less than or equal to the exponents in 1200's prime factorization.

So, to find the square factors, we can adjust the exponents of each prime in the factorization. Let me think: for each prime, the exponent in the square factor must be even and not exceed the exponent in 1200.

Let's break it down for each prime:

- For 2: Exponent in 1200 is 4. So, possible exponents in the square factor can be 0, 2, or 4. Because they have to be even and ≤4.
- For 3: Exponent in 1200 is 1. Since it's 1, the only even exponent possible is 0 because 2 would exceed 1, which is not allowed. So, exponent for 3 must be 0.
- For 5: Exponent in 1200 is 2. So, possible exponents are 0 or 2. Because 4 would be higher than 2, but 2 is acceptable.

So, the square factors are of the form 2^a × 3^0 × 5^b, where a can be 0, 2, 4 and b can be 0, 2. Let's list all possible combinations:

1. a=0, b=0: 2^0 × 5^0 = 1
2. a=0, b=2: 2^0 × 5^2 = 25
3. a=2, b=0: 2^2 × 5^0 = 4
4. a=2, b=2: 2^2 × 5^2 = 4 ×25 = 100
5. a=4, b=0: 2^4 ×5^0 =16
6. a=4, b=2: 2^4 ×5^2 =16 ×25= 400

Wait, let me double-check that. Wait, 16 ×25 is 400, but 400 is 20², which is 400, right? But 400 ×3 would be 1200, but since the square factor doesn't include 3, that's fine.

Wait, but 400 is a factor of 1200? Let me check: 1200 ÷400=3, which is an integer, so yes, 400 is a factor. So, the square factors are 1, 4, 16, 25, 100, 400.

Wait, but wait: 2^4 ×5^2 is 16×25=400, which is correct. So, the square factors are 1, 4, 16, 25, 100, 400.

Wait, but wait, is that all? Let me think again. Because for each prime, the exponents are as follows:

So, for 2: 0,2,4
For 3: only 0
For 5: 0,2

So, each combination would be:

a=0, b=0 → 1×1=1
a=0, b=2 →1×25=25
a=2, b=0 →4×1=4
a=2, b=2 →4×25=100
a=4, b=0 →16×1=16
a=4, b=2 →16×25=400

So, that makes six square factors: 1,4,16,25,100,400.

Wait, but wait, 400 is 20², and 100 is 10², 25 is 5², 16 is 4², 4 is 2², and 1 is 1². So, each of these is a square, and each divides 1200.

Now, each of these square factors is n², so n would be the square roots of these. Let's list them:

n² =1 →n=1
n²=4 →n=2
n²=16 →n=4
n²=25 →n=5
n²=100 →n=10
n²=400 →n=20

So, the possible n values are 1,2,4,5,10,20.

Now, the question is to find the sum of all positive integer values of n. So, let's add them up.

Let's compute:

1 + 2 =3
3 +4=7
7 +5=12
12 +10=22
22 +20=42

So, the sum is 42.

Wait, but let me check again to make sure I didn't miss any square factors. Did I miss any? Let me think.

Wait, another approach: the number of square factors can be found by taking the floor of each exponent divided by 2, adding 1, and then multiplying. So, for 1200's prime factors 2^4, 3^1,5^2.

For square factors, the exponents for each prime must be even and ≤ the exponent in 1200.

So, for 2: exponents can be 0,2,4 → 3 choices
For 3: since exponent is 1, the only even possible is 0 → 1 choice
For 5: exponents can be 0,2 →2 choices

Total square factors: 3×1×2=6, which matches the 6 I found earlier. So, I didn't miss any.

So, the n's are 1,2,4,5,10,20. Sum is 1+2+4+5+10+20=42. So, the correct answer should be 42, which is option D.
