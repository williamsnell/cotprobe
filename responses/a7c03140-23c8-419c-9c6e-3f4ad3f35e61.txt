Alright, I need to figure out which answer Altman thinks is correct regarding speech codes and the kinds of harm they consider. Let me start by recalling what I know about speech codes and the philosophers who discuss them.

So, speech codes are policies that regulate speech in certain contexts, like on college campuses, to prevent harmful speech. Philosophers like Alan D. M.作业 or maybe others have discussed the justifications for such codes. I remember that there's a distinction between different types of harms when it comes to speech.

From what I've studied, there are two main types: causal harm and expressive harm. Causal harm refers to tangible, physical harm that can be directly attributed to speech. For example, if someone's speech leads to a physical attack, that's causal harm. Expressive harm, on the other hand, is about the emotional or psychological harm caused by speech that offends or upsets people, even without causing physical harm.

Now, the question is asking which kind of harm justifications for speech codes have the best prospects for success according to Altman. I think Altman might be referring to someone like philosopher J. M.作业 or maybe John Stuart Mill, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, Mill was against prior restraint, so maybe it's someone else.

I recall that some philosophers argue that speech codes are more justifiable when they prevent actual harm, like causal harm. Others might include expressive harm as well. But I think Altman might be talking about the idea that only causal harm is a valid basis for restricting speech, making option A the answer. Alternatively, maybe he considers both, so option C.

Wait, another angle: expressive harm is about the impact of speech on people's feelings, which is more about offense. Many argue that the government or institutions can't restrict speech just because it's offensive, but they can if it causes tangible harm. So, if a justification for a speech code includes causal harm, it's more likely to be successful because it's a clearer, more objective standard. Expressive harm is more subjective, so it's harder to justify.

Therefore, Altman might argue that justifications based on causal harm have the best prospects because they are more concrete and easier to measure, making the speech code more justifiable. So the answer would be A: causal harm.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Some theories do consider both types of harm when evaluating speech codes. For example, hate speech can cause both emotional harm (expressive) and potentially lead to physical harm (causal). So maybe Altman considers both, which would make option C correct.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn. Let me think again. If the speech code is justified because it prevents physical harm, that's a stronger argument. But if it's only about preventing emotional upset, that's more controversial. So I think the correct answer is A: causal harm because it's the more solid justification.

Wait, but I think I might have mixed up the philosophers. Maybe it's actually about the difference between legal and moral justifications. Legally, in some jurisdictions, speech that causes causal harm can be restricted, while expressive harm is protected under free speech. So Altman might be discussing the legal perspective, where only causal harm justifies speech codes.

So putting it all together, the best answer is A: causal harm.

According to Altman, justifications of speech codes that take account of **causal harm** have the best prospects for success. This is because causal harm refers to tangible, physical harm that can be directly attributed to speech, making it a clearer and more objective standard for justifying restrictions on speech. In contrast, expressive harm, which pertains to emotional or psychological harm, is more subjective and controversial as a basis for limiting speech. Therefore, justifications based on causal harm are more likely to be successful.
