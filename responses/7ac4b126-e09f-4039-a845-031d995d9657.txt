Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the combustion of benzene. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the reaction given is C6H6(l) + 7/2 O2(g) → 6CO2(g) + 3H2O(l). They're asking for the enthalpy change (ΔH) per mole of benzene at 77°F. The data provided is that 18000 Btu/lb of benzene is evolved. Oh wait, and the molecular weight of benzene is 78.11 lb/lbmole. 

Wait, so first, I need to convert the given Btu per pound to Btu per lbmole. Since 1 lbmole is 78.11 pounds, right? So if 1 lb releases 18000 Btu, then 78.11 lbs would release 18000 * 78.11 Btu per lbmole. But wait, wait. Actually, since it's per pound, I multiply by the number of pounds in a lbmole to get the total per mole. So yeah, 18000 Btu/lb times 78.11 lb/lbmole. Let me compute that.

Calculating that, 18000 * 78.11 equals... 18000 * 70 is 1,260,000, and 18000 * 8.11 is 146,  let me see, 18000 *8=144,000, and 18000 *0.11=1,980. So total 144,000 + 1,980 = 145,980. So adding that to 1,260,000 gives 1,260,000 + 145,980 = 1,405,980 Btu/lbmole. Wait, but wait, is that positive or negative? Because combustion is exothermic, so the enthalpy change should be negative. So 1,405,980 Btu/lbmole as a negative value. 

Looking at the options, option B is -1.40598 ×10^6, which is -1405980. That matches exactly what I calculated. So the answer should be option B.

The enthalpy change per lbmole is calculated by multiplying the Btu per pound by the molecular weight. 

18000 Btu/lb × 78.11 lb/lbmole = 1,405,980 Btu/lbmole. Since combustion is exothermic, the value is negative. 

The correct answer is B: -1.40598 ×10^6 Btu/lbmole.

Answer: B
