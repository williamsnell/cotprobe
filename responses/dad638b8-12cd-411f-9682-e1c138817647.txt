Okay, so I have this question about the ancient city of Cahokia, and I need to figure out the correct answer. The question is asking about what the city contained more than a certain number of something and had a population around a specific number. The options are A through J, each giving two numbers corresponding to the blanks.

First, I should recall what I know about Cahokia. I remember it was a significant pre-Columbian city located near present-day St. Louis, right? It was a major center for the Mississippian culture, I think. I also recall that it's known for its mounds. There are a lot of earthen mounds there, which were used for various purposes like ceremonial or burial sites.

Looking at the options, I see several mentions of mounds. Let's go through them:

Option A: 40 residential complexes; 40,000 people. Hmm, I'm not sure about the number of residential complexes. I know Cahokia was big, but 40,000 seems high, but I'm not certain.

Option B: 50 religious monuments; 5,000. Religious monuments might be part of it, but 5,000 people seems low for a major city. I think the population was more substantial.

Option C: 120 earthen mounds; 10,000. That sounds familiar. I remember that Cahokia had over 100 mounds, and a population in the tens of thousands makes sense.

Option D: 70 public squares; 7,000. Public squares don't ring a bell as the main feature. Plus, 7,000 is on the lower side for population.

Option E: 80 ceremonial mounds; 50,000. Ceremonial mounds are a possibility, but 50,000 population seems too high. I think the population was around 20,000 to 30,000 at its peak.

Option F: 200 pyramidal mounds; 200,000. That's way too many mounds, and the population of 200,000 is extremely high for a pre-Columbian city in that region.

Option G: 60 burial mounds; 2,000. Burial mounds are part of it, but 2,000 people is too low. I believe the population was much larger.

Option H: 30 agricultural terraces; 30,000. Agricultural terraces might be there, but 30 seems low for a city that's known for mounds.

Option I: 150 defensive walls; 15,000. I'm not sure about defensive walls being the main feature. 15,000 population is possible but I thought it was higher.

Option J: 100 trading posts; 1,000. Trading posts don't seem to be the key feature, and 1,000 is way too low.

Now, focusing on the mounds. I'm pretty sure that Cahokia had more than 100 mounds. Some sources say over 200, but I think the commonly cited number is around 120. Let me think: I've read that the largest mounds were part of a complex, like Monks Mound, which is a huge structure. So the number of mounds is definitely more than 100.

As for population, I remember that estimates vary, but it's often cited that the population was around 10,000 to 20,000 at its peak. So 10,000 seems plausible as a lower estimate.

Looking back at the options, option C says 120 earthen mounds and 10,000 population. That fits with what I remember. Option E is 80 ceremonial mounds and 50,000, which I think is less likely because the population was probably not that high, and 80 seems low for the number of mounds.

So, I think the correct answer is C: 120 earthen mounds; 10,000.
