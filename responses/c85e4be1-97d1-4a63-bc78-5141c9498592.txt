Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let's see what it says. The question is about a rhombus QRST with diagonals intersecting at point P. They give me that the measure of angle QTS is 76 degrees, and I need to find the measure of angle TSP.

First, I remember that in a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the opposite angles are equal. Also, the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. So they intersect each other at 90 degrees. That might come in handy.

Let me try to visualize the rhombus. QRST is a rhombus, so the points are labeled in order, making sure that opposite sides are equal and the diagonals intersect at P. So, Q is connected to R and S, R is connected to S and T, and so on.

Now, angle QTS is given as 76 degrees. Wait, angle QTS is at point T, between points Q, T, and S. So that's one of the angles of the rhombus. Since opposite angles in a rhombus are equal, I think that angle QTS is one of the angles, but wait, in a rhombus, each angle is at a vertex, right? So maybe angle QTS isn't exactly one of the main angles but a smaller angle formed by the diagonal.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles. So each diagonal divides the vertex angles into two equal parts. Therefore, if angle QTS is 76 degrees, that's the angle formed by the diagonal at point T. So perhaps that's half of one of the main angles of the rhombus.

Wait, no, maybe not. Let me clarify. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the vertex angles. So, for example, if you have vertex Q, the diagonal from Q to S would split angle Q into two equal angles. Similarly, the diagonal from R to T would split angle R into two equal angles.

Wait, but in this case, angle QTS is at point T. So let me see: point T is connected to Q and S, right? So when you draw diagonal QS, it connects Q and S, and point T is connected to both. So angle QTS is the angle at T between QT and ST, which are two sides of the rhombus. Wait, but in a rhombus, all sides are equal, so QT and ST are sides, but wait, that can't be right because in a rhombus, each side is connected to two other sides at each vertex. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe I should draw a diagram mentally. Let's say the rhombus is labeled QRST in order, so Q is connected to R and S, R is connected to S and T, S is connected to T and Q, and T is connected to Q and R. No, that doesn't make sense because in a rhombus, the order should be such that each consecutive point is connected by a side. So perhaps a better way is to imagine the rhombus with vertices Q, R, S, T arranged so that each side is equal.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the properties again. The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at 90 degrees, and they bisect the vertex angles. So, each diagonal divides the angle at each vertex into two equal parts.

So, if angle QTS is 76 degrees, that's the angle at T between points Q, T, and S. So, Q-T-S is 76 degrees. Now, since the diagonals bisect the angles, perhaps this is half of the angle at T?

Wait, no, because in a rhombus, the diagonals split the vertex angles into two equal parts. So, for example, if the angle at T is, say, 152 degrees, then the diagonal would split it into two angles of 76 degrees each. So, in that case, angle QTS would be 76 degrees, which would mean that the actual angle at T in the rhombus is 152 degrees. Because 76 times 2 is 152.

Wait, but then the opposite angle in the rhombus (at point R) would be the same as angle T, so it would also be 152 degrees. And the other two angles (at Q and S) would each be 180 - 152 = 28 degrees, since consecutive angles in a rhombus are supplementary.

But wait, that seems a bit off because 28 degrees seems quite small, but maybe that's correct. Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe angle QTS is not the angle at the vertex but an angle formed by the diagonal. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to clarify.

In rhombus QRST, the diagonals intersect at P. So, point P is the midpoint of both diagonals QS and RT. Now, angle QTS is at point T, between QT and ST. But wait, QT is a side of the rhombus, and ST is another side. So, angle QTS is actually one of the internal angles of the rhombus at point T. So, if angle QTS is 76 degrees, that's the measure of one of the angles of the rhombus.

Wait, but wait. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles. So, if angle QTS is 76 degrees, then that's the measure of one of the angles at the vertex. But wait, no, because when you have a diagonal from Q to S, it would split the angle at Q into two equal parts. Similarly, the diagonal from R to T would split the angle at T into two equal parts.

Wait, so angle QTS is actually one of the angles formed by the diagonal at point T. So, if the angle at T is, say, 152 degrees, then the diagonal RT would split it into two angles of 76 degrees each. So, angle QTS would be 76 degrees, which would be half of the actual angle at T.

Wait, but then the angle at T in the rhombus would be 152 degrees, and the opposite angle at point R would also be 152 degrees. The other two angles at Q and S would each be 180 - 152 = 28 degrees. That seems possible, but I'm not sure if that makes sense in this context.

Now, the question is asking for the measure of angle TSP. Let me see where point S is. Point S is one of the vertices of the rhombus. So, angle TSP is the angle at point S between points T, S, and P.

Wait, P is the intersection point of the diagonals. So, P is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, in the rhombus, the diagonals intersect at P, which is the center point.

So, angle TSP is formed at point S by points T, S, and P. So, that's the angle between ST and SP.

Hmm, perhaps I can use some triangle properties here. Let's consider triangle TSP. Since P is the midpoint of the diagonals, the diagonals bisect each other, so SP is half of the diagonal QS, and TP is half of the diagonal RT.

Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, the angle between the diagonals is 90 degrees. So, at point P, the angle between the diagonals is 90 degrees.

But I'm trying to find angle TSP, which is at point S. Let me think about triangle TSP. Points T, S, and P form a triangle. Let me see if I can find any right angles or other known angles in this triangle.

Alternatively, maybe I can use some properties of the rhombus. Since the diagonals bisect the angles, and they intersect at P, which is the midpoint, then perhaps the triangles formed by the diagonals are congruent.

Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals split it into four congruent right triangles. So, each of these triangles has angles of 90 degrees, and the other two angles depend on the original angles of the rhombus.

So, if I consider triangle QPT, for example, it's a right-angled triangle at P, with legs QP and PT, and hypotenuse QT, which is a side of the rhombus.

Wait, but in this case, I'm looking at triangle TSP. Hmm, perhaps I can find some angles in this triangle.

Wait, if angle QTS is 76 degrees, and that's at point T, then perhaps that is one of the angles formed by the diagonal. If the angle at T is 76 degrees, then the diagonal RT splits it into two angles of 76 degrees each. Wait, no, that can't be because 76 times 2 would be 152, which would make the angle at T 152 degrees, as I thought earlier.

But wait, maybe angle QTS is just 76 degrees, which is the angle at T, making the other angles in the rhombus different. I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to approach this differently.

Since the diagonals intersect at P, and they bisect each other at 90 degrees, I can think about the triangles formed. For example, triangle TSP is part of the rhombus, and since the diagonals are perpendicular, perhaps there are some right angles involved.

Wait, let me think about the properties again. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at 90 degrees, so angle SPQ is 90 degrees. But I'm looking at angle TSP.

Wait, perhaps I can find the measure of angle TSP by using the fact that the diagonals bisect the angles at each vertex. So, if angle QTS is 76 degrees, that's the angle at T between QT and ST. Since the diagonal RT splits this angle into two equal parts, each part would be 38 degrees. So, angle QTR and angle STR would each be 38 degrees.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me clarify: in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the vertex angles. So, if the angle at T is, say, 152 degrees, then the diagonal RT would split it into two angles of 76 degrees each. So, angle QTR and angle STR would each be 76 degrees. That would make sense because 76 times 2 is 152.

Wait, but then angle QTS would be 76 degrees, which is what's given. So, that suggests that the angle at T in the rhombus is 152 degrees, and the other two angles at Q and S would each be 28 degrees, since consecutive angles in a rhombus are supplementary (they add up to 180 degrees).

Now, I need to find angle TSP. Let's look at point S. The angle at S in the rhombus is 28 degrees, as we determined. The diagonal SP (which is part of the diagonal QS) would split this angle into two equal parts of 14 degrees each.

Wait, but angle TSP is at point S between points T, S, and P. So, perhaps I can consider triangle TSP. Let me see: point S is connected to T and P. The angle at S is 28 degrees, so when the diagonal SP splits it, each angle would be 14 degrees. But is angle TSP one of those 14-degree angles?

Wait, no, because angle TSP is formed by points T, S, and P. So, perhaps in triangle TSP, the angle at S is 14 degrees. But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe I can use some triangle properties. Since the diagonals intersect at P, which is the midpoint, and they are perpendicular, perhaps the triangles formed are right-angled.

Wait, in triangle TSP, if I can find two sides or some angles, I can find angle TSP. Let's see: point T is connected to S and P, point S is connected to P and T, and point P is the intersection of the diagonals.

Wait, another approach: in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, so SP is half the length of diagonal QS, and TP is half the length of diagonal RT.

Wait, but maybe I can use the fact that angle QTS is 76 degrees to find some other angles. Since angle QTS is 76 degrees, and the diagonals bisect each other at 90 degrees, perhaps I can find some relationships.

Wait, maybe if I consider triangle QTS, which is part of the rhombus. In triangle QTS, angle QTS is 76 degrees, and sides QT and ST are equal because all sides of the rhombus are equal. So, triangle QTS is an isosceles triangle with QT = ST, and angle at T is 76 degrees. Therefore, the base angles at Q and S would be equal.

Wait, no, because in triangle QTS, the sides QT and ST are sides of the rhombus, so they are equal. Therefore, the base angles at Q and S would be equal. So, let me calculate those angles.

In triangle QTS, the sum of angles is 180 degrees. So, 76 degrees (at T) plus 2 times angle at Q (which equals angle at S) equals 180. So, 2 times angle Q = 180 -76 = 104. Therefore, angle Q and angle S in triangle QTS are each 52 degrees.

Wait, but that's within triangle QTS. However, in the context of the rhombus, angle Q in the rhombus would be different. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the angles.

Wait, maybe I should think about the angles formed by the diagonals. Since the diagonals intersect at P, which is the midpoint, and they bisect each other at 90 degrees, the four triangles formed (like QPT, PRS, etc.) are all right-angled triangles.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the diagonals bisect the angles, so in triangle TSP, angle at S is half of the angle at S in the rhombus. Since the angle at S in the rhombus is 28 degrees, then angle TSP would be half of that, which is 14 degrees. But that's not one of the options. So maybe I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the angles. Let me try another approach.

Since angle QTS is 76 degrees, and the diagonals bisect each other at 90 degrees, perhaps angle TSP is 38 degrees. Because if the diagonal from S to P splits the angle at S into two equal parts, and the angle at S in the rhombus is 28 degrees, then each part is 14 degrees, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me try to think of it differently.

In rhombus QRST, diagonals intersect at P. So, angle QTS is 76 degrees. That's the angle at T between QT and ST. Since the diagonals bisect the angles, the diagonal from T to P would split angle QTS into two equal angles of 38 degrees each.

Wait, no, because the diagonal from T is RT, which connects to point R, not P. Wait, P is the midpoint, so the diagonal RT passes through P. So, angle QTS is 76 degrees, and the diagonal RT splits it into two angles of 38 degrees each.

So, at point T, the angle between QT and TP is 38 degrees, and the angle between ST and TP is also 38 degrees.

Now, looking at triangle TSP, which is formed by points T, S, and P. In this triangle, angle at T is 38 degrees (as we just determined), and the angle at P is 90 degrees because the diagonals intersect at right angles.

Wait, no, because in triangle TSP, the angle at P is part of the diagonal intersection, which is 90 degrees. But in triangle TSP, the angle at P is between SP and TP. Since the diagonals intersect at 90 degrees, that angle is 90 degrees.

Wait, but in triangle TSP, the sum of angles must be 180 degrees. So, if angle at T is 38 degrees and angle at P is 90 degrees, then angle at S (which is angle TSP) would be 180 - 38 - 90 = 52 degrees.

Wait, that's 52 degrees, which is option E.

But let me double-check that. So, in triangle TSP, angle at T is 38 degrees (half of 76), angle at P is 90 degrees, so angle at S is 52 degrees. That seems correct.

Alternatively, another way to think about it: the diagonals of a rhombus bisect the vertex angles. So, angle QTS is 76 degrees, which is half of the vertex angle at T. Therefore, the actual vertex angle at T is 152 degrees. Then, the adjacent angle at S is 180 - 152 = 28 degrees.

Now, the diagonal SP (which is part of diagonal QS) splits the vertex angle at S into two equal parts. So, each part is 14 degrees. But in triangle TSP, the angle at S is not that 14 degrees, because triangle TSP is formed by points T, S, and P.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the angles. Let me think again: in the rhombus, the angle at S is 28 degrees, so the diagonal SP splits it into two angles of 14 degrees each. So, in triangle TSP, the angle at S is 14 degrees, but that's not correct because that would make the sum of angles in triangle TSP as 38 (at T) + 90 (at P) +14 (at S) = 142, which is more than 180. So that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the properties of the rhombus and the triangles formed by the diagonals.

In a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal unless it's a square. They bisect each other at 90 degrees, and each diagonal bisects the vertex angles. So, if angle QTS is 76 degrees, that's the angle at T between QT and ST. Since the diagonal RT passes through P and splits the angle at T into two equal parts, each part is 76/2 = 38 degrees.

So, in triangle TSP, which is part of the rhombus, we have point P where the diagonals intersect at 90 degrees. So, in triangle TSP, angle at P is 90 degrees, angle at T is 38 degrees (from the bisected angle), and angle at S is what we're trying to find.

So, the sum of angles in triangle TSP is 180 degrees. So, angle at S (which is angle TSP) = 180 - 90 -38 = 52 degrees.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the measure of angle TSP is 52 degrees, which is option E.

The problem involves a rhombus QRST with diagonals intersecting at point P. Given that angle QTS is 76 degrees, we need to find the measure of angle TSP.

In a rhombus, diagonals bisect each other at right angles and also bisect the vertex angles. Since angle QTS is 76 degrees, it is half of the vertex angle at T, making the actual vertex angle at T equal to 152 degrees. Consequently, the adjacent vertex angle at S is 28 degrees (since consecutive angles in a rhombus are supplementary).

Focusing on triangle TSP, angle at T is half of 76 degrees (38 degrees), angle at P is 90 degrees (due to the perpendicular diagonals), and angle TSP is the remaining angle. Using the triangle angle sum property:

\[
\text{Angle TSP} = 180^\circ - 90^\circ - 38^\circ = 52^\circ
\]

Thus, the measure of angle TSP is **52 degrees**.
