Okay, so I've got this problem about the diffusion of NaCl through a silica matrix. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem states that there's a porous sintered mass of silica. The void fraction is 0.31, tortuosity is 4.0, and the thickness is 2.5 mm. The pores are filled with water at 291 K. On one side, NaCl is at 0.2 kmol/m³, and water flows on the other side. I need to find the steady-state diffusion of NaCl, considering only the resistance of the silica.

Wait, so this is about mass transfer through a porous medium. I remember that in such cases, the effective diffusion coefficient is influenced by the tortuosity and the void fraction. Oh right, the effective diffusion coefficient (D_eff) is given by D_eff = D * ε / τ, where D is the molecular diffusion coefficient, ε is the void fraction, and τ is the tortuosity.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Do I have the formula right? Oh yeah, tortuosity (τ) is a measure of how much the pore structure twists and turns, making the effective path longer than the geometrical thickness. So higher tortuosity means more resistance.

Now, the steady-state diffusion—so we’re probably using Fick's second law, but since it's a steady state, the flux should be constant. The flux (J) is given by J = -D_eff * (dc/dx), where c is the concentration and x is the spatial coordinate.

Wait, but in this case, we have a concentration gradient across the silica. On one side, it's 0.2 kmol/m³, and on the other, it's just water. So I think that's where the gradient comes from. Wait, actually, the water is flowing on the other side, but I'm not sure if that affects the concentration gradient directly. Maybe it's just a convective effect, but the problem says to take into account only the resistance of the silica, so perhaps we can ignore convection and focus on diffusion.

So, the setup is that the concentration of NaCl is higher on one side (0.2 kmol/m³) and lower on the other (maybe zero, but I'm not sure). Wait, the problem doesn't specify the concentration on the other side; it just says water flows there. Maybe that's the exit point where the concentration is zero? Or perhaps it's negligible. Hmm, maybe I need to assume that the concentration on the other side is zero, so the flux is driven by this concentration difference.

Wait, but if the water is flowing, perhaps there's a convective mass transfer happening as well. But the problem says to consider only the resistance of the silica, so perhaps we can treat it as a simple diffusion problem where the concentration gradient is from 0.2 kmol/m³ to zero over the thickness of the silica.

So, let's lay out the variables:

- Void fraction (ε) = 0.31
- Tortuosity (τ) = 4.0
- Thickness (L) = 2.5 mm = 0.0025 m
- Concentration at one side (c1) = 0.2 kmol/m³
- Concentration at the other side (c2) = 0 (assuming all NaCl is washed away)
- Temperature (T) = 291 K

Wait, but I don't have the molecular diffusion coefficient (D) of NaCl in water at 291 K. Oh, right, I think I need to look that up or recall it. From my notes, I think the diffusion coefficient for NaCl in water at around 25°C (which is 298 K) is about 1.3 × 10^-9 m²/s. But the temperature here is 291 K, which is a bit lower. Hmm, how does temperature affect it? I think D increases with temperature, but since 291 is close to 298, maybe I can approximate it as 1.3 × 10^-9 m²/s. Or perhaps it's given in the problem? Wait, no, the problem doesn't provide D. So maybe I should proceed with the formula and see.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the steady-state diffusion, which is the flux, J. So, the flux would be J = (c1 - c2) / L * D_eff, but wait, that's for a simple one-dimensional case where the concentration varies linearly. Alternatively, using Fick's first law, J = -D_eff * (dc/dx), and since dc/dx is (c1 - c2)/L, then J = D_eff * (c1 - c2) / L.

But wait, let me think again. If c2 is zero, then J = (c1 / L) * D_eff.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the concentration on the other side is zero. The problem says water flows on the other side, but it doesn't specify the concentration. Maybe it's that the concentration is zero there, making it a first-order boundary condition. Alternatively, perhaps the concentration gradient is set up, and the flux depends on the effective diffusion coefficient and the gradient.

So, first, I need to compute D_eff. D_eff = D * ε / τ.

Assuming D for NaCl in water at 291 K is approximately 1.3 × 10^-9 m²/s. Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think—another source I recall says D for NaCl in water around 20°C is about 1.3 × 10^-9 m²/s. So I'll go with that.

So D_eff = (1.3e-9 m²/s) * 0.31 / 4.0.

Calculating that: 0.31 /4 is approximately 0.0775. So D_eff = 1.3e-9 * 0.0775 ≈ 1.0075e-10 m²/s.

Wait, but wait, unit-wise, that's correct. Now, the flux J is D_eff multiplied by the concentration gradient. The concentration gradient is (c1 - c2)/L. Assuming c2 is zero, gradient is c1 / L.

So, J = (c1 / L) * D_eff.

Plugging in numbers: c1 is 0.2 kmol/m³, L is 0.0025 m.

So, c1 / L = 0.2 / 0.0025 = 80 kmol/m⁴.

Wait, kmol/m³ divided by m is kmol/m^4? Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Let me check units. No, wait, c is in kmol/m³, L is in m. So (c1 / L) would be (kmol/m³) / m = kmol/m^4.

Then J = (80 kmol/m^4) * (1.0075e-10 m²/s) = 8.06e-9 kmol/(m²·s).

Wait, that's approximately 8.06e-9 kmol/m²·s. Looking at the options, the closest is option A: 8.50 × 10^-9, option E:7.50e-9, etc. Wait, but wait, I might have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate D_eff. D = 1.3e-9 m²/s, ε=0.31, τ=4.

So D_eff = (1.3e-9) * 0.31 /4 = (1.3e-9) * (0.0775) ≈ 1.0075e-10 m²/s.

Then, J = (c1 / L) * D_eff.

c1 is 0.2 kmol/m³, L=0.0025 m.

c1/L = 0.2 / 0.0025 = 80 kmol/m^4.

So J = 80 * 1.0075e-10 = 8.06e-9 kmol/(m²·s).

Hmm, but looking at the options, option A is 8.5e-9, which is a bit higher, but maybe I approximated D too low. Let me check if the D for NaCl is different.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, the effective diffusion coefficient might also involve the Peclet number if there's convection, but the problem says to consider only the resistance of the silica, so perhaps convection isn't considered here. So it's just diffusion.

Wait, but in my calculation, I got J as 8.06e-9, which is close to option A:8.5e-9. But perhaps I should be more precise with the D value.

Wait, maybe the D for NaCl in water is higher. Let me think—I think at 25°C, D for NaCl is around 1.3e-9 m²/s, but at 291 K, which is about 18°C, the D might be a bit lower. Wait, but that's only a small change. Let me check: the diffusion coefficient generally increases with temperature. So at 291 K, which is cooler than 298 K, D might be a bit lower, say around 1.2e-9 m²/s. Let's recalculate with D=1.2e-9.

So D_eff = 1.2e-9 * 0.31 /4 = (1.2e-9) * 0.0775 ≈ 9.3e-11 m²/s.

Then J = (0.2 / 0.0025) * 9.3e-11 = 80 * 9.3e-11 = 7.44e-9 kmol/(m²·s).

That's approximately 7.44e-9, which is close to option E (7.5e-9) or option F (7e-9). Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I should use the exact value for D. Let me look it up in my notes—actually, I think the D for NaCl in water at 291 K is about 1.2e-9 m²/s. So with that, J would be 7.44e-9, which is about 7.44e-9, so closest to option E (7.5e-9) or perhaps option F (7e-9). Wait, but the options don't have 7.44. The options are A:8.5, B:9, C:6, D:7.25, E:7.5, F:7, etc.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula for J. Let me think again.

Wait, the flux J is given by J = (D_eff * A) * (c1 - c2) / L, where A is the area. But perhaps I'm getting confused between flux and molar flow rate. Alternatively, using Fick's law, J = -D_eff * (dc/dx), which is D_eff * (c1 - c2)/L.

Wait, but I'm calculating J as (c1/L) * D_eff, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation again with more precise numbers.

Let me recalculate D_eff:

D = 1.2e-9 m²/s (assuming D=1.2e-9)

ε=0.31, τ=4.

D_eff = (1.2e-9) * (0.31) / 4 = (1.2e-9 * 0.31) = 0.372e-9.

Then divided by 4: 0.372e-9 /4 = 0.093e-9 = 9.3e-11 m²/s.

Then J = (0.2 / 0.0025) * 9.3e-11.

0.2 / 0.0025 = 80.

80 * 9.3e-11 = 7.44e-9 kmol/(m²·s).

So about 7.44e-9, which is approximately 7.4e-9. Looking at the options, option E is 7.5e-9, which is very close. Alternatively, maybe I should have used a higher D.

Wait, perhaps the D for NaCl is higher. Let me think again—I might have mixed up units. Wait, sometimes D is given in cm²/s. Oh! Yes, that's a common confusion. Let me check: 1 m² = 1e4 dm² = 1e8 cm². Wait, no, 1 m = 100 cm, so 1 m² = (100 cm)^2 = 10,000 cm². So 1 m²/s = 1e4 cm²/s.

Wait, so if D is given as 1.3 cm²/s, that's 1.3e-4 m²/s. Oh, that's a big difference! Did I mix up the units earlier?

Wait, I think I did. Let me clarify: the diffusion coefficient for NaCl in water is about 1.3 cm²/s at 25°C. So that's 1.3e-4 m²/s.

Oh no, that changes everything. I made a mistake earlier by a factor of 1e4. So D is actually 1.3e-4 m²/s, not 1e-9. Oh no, that's a big mistake.

Wait, let me confirm: 1 cm²/s = (0.01 m)^2/s = 1e-4 m²/s. So 1.3 cm²/s = 1.3e-4 m²/s.

So with that correction, D = 1.3e-4 m²/s.

Now, let's recalculate D_eff.

D_eff = D * ε / τ = (1.3e-4) * 0.31 / 4.

Calculating that: 1.3e-4 * 0.31 = 0.403e-4 = 4.03e-5.

Divided by 4: 4.03e-5 /4 ≈ 1.0075e-5 m²/s.

Now, J = (c1 / L) * D_eff.

c1 = 0.2 kmol/m³, L=0.0025 m.

c1 / L = 0.2 / 0.0025 = 80 kmol/m^4.

So J = 80 * 1.0075e-5 = 8.06e-4 kmol/(m²·s).

Wait, that's way higher than the options given. The options are all in the 1e-9 range, but this is 8e-4, which is much larger. Hmm, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake in the unit conversion?

Wait a second, perhaps the concentration is given in kmol/m³, but I might have missed a conversion. Let's think again.

Wait, 1 kmol is 1e3 mol. So 0.2 kmol/m³ is 200 mol/m³.

Wait, but when calculating flux, the units are kmol/(m²·s). So perhaps I should keep the units straight.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation:

D_eff = 1.3e-4 m²/s * 0.31 /4 = 1.3e-4 * 0.0775 ≈ 1.0075e-5 m²/s.

Then, J = (c1 / L) * D_eff.

c1 = 0.2 kmol/m³.

L = 0.0025 m.

So (c1 / L) = (0.2 / 0.0025) = 80 kmol/m^4.

Then J = 80 * 1.0075e-5 = 8.06e-4 kmol/(m²·s).

But the options are in the 1e-9 range, so I'm way off. What did I do wrong?

Wait, perhaps the D is much smaller. Because 1.3e-4 m²/s seems high. Let me double-check the D value.

Wait, I think I may have confused cm²/s with m²/s. Let me confirm: the diffusion coefficient for NaCl in water is indeed about 1.3 cm²/s at 25°C. So 1.3 cm²/s is 1.3e-4 m²/s. So that part is correct.

Wait, but then why is the flux so high compared to the options? The options are about 1e-9, but my calculation gives 8e-4, which is 8e5 times larger. That can't be right. I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the effective diffusion coefficient is different. Let me think again: the formula is D_eff = D * ε / τ, where D is the molecular diffusion coefficient in the pore fluid. So if D is in m²/s, that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the concentration gradient is not (c1 - c2)/L, but something else. Maybe I'm missing a factor related to the void fraction in the concentration calculation.

Wait, because the material is porous, perhaps the concentration gradient is adjusted by the void fraction. Alternatively, maybe the effective thickness is L * τ / ε, which would change the gradient.

Hmm, maybe the effective path length is L_eff = L * τ / ε. Because tortuosity increases the effective path length. So the actual path length that the molecules travel is longer due to the tortuous path.

So, the concentration gradient would be (c1 - c2) / L_eff, where L_eff = L * τ / ε.

So, L_eff = 0.0025 m * 4 / 0.31 ≈ 0.0025 * 4 = 0.01 m; 0.01 / 0.31 ≈ 0.032258 m.

Then, the gradient is (c1 - c2)/L_eff = 0.2 / 0.032258 ≈ 6.196 kmol/m^4.

Then, J = D_eff * gradient.

D_eff is 1.0075e-5 m²/s.

So J = 6.196 * 1.0075e-5 ≈ 6.24e-5 kmol/(m²·s).

Wait, that's 6.24e-5, which is 6.24e-5 kmol/m²·s, which is 6.24e-5 kmol/(m²·s). But the options are in 1e-9, so still not matching.

Hmm, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the formula for flux in a porous medium is J = (c1 - c2) * D_eff * A / L_eff, where L_eff is the effective path length.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is J = (D_eff * A) * (c1 - c2) / (L * τ / ε).

Wait, let me try that approach.

So, J = (D_eff * A) * (c1 - c2) / (L * τ / ε).

Simplifying, J = (D_eff * A) * ε (c1 - c2) / (L τ).

But since A is area, and flux is per unit area, perhaps A cancels out. So J = D_eff * (c1 - c2) * ε / (L τ).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the effective thickness is L * τ / ε, as tortuosity increases the path length.

So, the effective thickness (L_eff) = L * τ / ε.

Then, the concentration gradient is (c1 - c2)/L_eff.

So, gradient = (0.2 kmol/m³) / (L_eff).

L_eff = 0.0025 m * 4 / 0.31 ≈ 0.032258 m.

Gradient = 0.2 / 0.032258 ≈ 6.196 kmol/m^4.

Then, J = D_eff * gradient.

D_eff = 1.3e-4 m²/s * 0.31 /4 ≈ 1.0075e-5 m²/s.

So J = 1.0075e-5 * 6.196 ≈ 6.23e-5 kmol/(m²·s).

Hmm, that's 6.23e-5, which is 6.23e-5 kmol/m²·s.

But the options are in 1e-9 kmol/m²·s. So I'm way off. I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the units for D are in cm²/s, which I should convert to m²/s correctly. Wait, 1 cm²/s = 1e-4 m²/s. So if D is 1.3 cm²/s, it's 1.3e-4 m²/s. So that part was correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the concentration is given in kmol/m³, but when calculating flux, I should convert it to mol/m³.

Wait, no, because flux in terms of kmol would just carry the unit accordingly. So that shouldn't affect the magnitude.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the effective diffusion coefficient. Maybe the formula is D_eff = D * τ / ε. Wait, no, I think it's D_eff = D * ε / τ. Because higher tortuosity makes the effective diffusion coefficient lower.

Wait, let me double-check the formula for effective diffusion coefficient in a porous medium. The effective diffusion coefficient is given by D_eff = D * (ε / τ). So that's correct.

Wait, but maybe the formula is D_eff = D_apparent = D * (ε / τ). So that's what I used.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the concentration gradient is calculated incorrectly. Let me think: the thickness is 2.5 mm, but the actual path length is longer due to tortuosity. So the effective path length is L_eff = L * τ / ε.

So, with L=0.0025 m, τ=4, ε=0.31, L_eff = 0.0025 *4 /0.31 ≈ 0.032258 m.

Then, the concentration difference is 0.2 kmol/m³ across L_eff.

So, the concentration gradient (dc/dx) = 0.2 / 0.032258 ≈ 6.196 kmol/m^4.

Then, J = D_eff * (dc/dx).

D_eff = 1.3e-4 m²/s * 0.31 /4 ≈ 1.0075e-5 m²/s.

So J = 1.0075e-5 * 6.196 ≈ 6.23e-5 kmol/(m²·s).

Wait, that's 6.23e-5, which is 6.23e-5 kmol/m²·s. But the options are around 1e-9, which is three orders of magnitude smaller. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the concentration is in kmol/m³, and perhaps I'm missing a conversion factor. Let me check the units again.

Wait, 1 kmol is 1e3 mol. So 0.2 kmol/m³ is 200 mol/m³.

But when calculating flux, J is in kmol/(m²·s). So perhaps I should express everything in consistent units.

Wait, but in my calculation, I used c1 as 0.2 kmol/m³, which is correct, and L in meters. So the units should be okay.

Wait, maybe the formula for flux is different. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula J = (c1 - c2) * D_eff / L_eff.

So, J = (0.2) * (1.0075e-5) / 0.032258.

Calculating that: 0.2 * 1.0075e-5 = 2.015e-6.

Divided by 0.032258: 2.015e-6 / 0.032258 ≈ 6.246e-5 kmol/(m²·s).

Still the same result. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the D is given in a different unit. Maybe the D is 1.3e-9 m²/s, not 1.3e-4. That would make more sense with the options. Let me try that.

So, D = 1.3e-9 m²/s.

Then, D_eff = 1.3e-9 * 0.31 /4 ≈ 1.0075e-10 m²/s.

Then, J = (0.2 / 0.0025) * 1.0075e-10 = 80 * 1.0075e-10 = 8.06e-9 kmol/(m²·s).

That matches option A:8.5e-9. But earlier I thought D was 1.3e-4, but perhaps it's 1.3e-9. That could be the confusion.

Wait, but where did I get D=1.3e-4? I thought it was cm²/s. Oh, that's where the confusion is. Let me clarify:

- 1 cm²/s = 1e-4 m²/s.

So, if D is 1.3 cm²/s, that's 1.3e-4 m²/s.

But if D is given as 1.3e-9 m²/s, then that's a much smaller value, leading to the flux being around 8e-9, matching option A.

But why would D be 1.3e-9? That would imply that the molecular diffusion coefficient is in m²/s, which is correct, but the value seems too small. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me look it up again.

Wait, I think I'm confusing the units. Let me find the correct D for NaCl in water at 291 K.

Upon checking, the diffusion coefficient for NaCl in water at 25°C (298 K) is approximately 1.3 cm²/s. So that's 1.3e-4 m²/s.

So, using that, J comes out to be 6.23e-5 kmol/(m²·s), which is way larger than the options.

But the options are around 1e-9, which suggests that D is much smaller, like 1.3e-9 m²/s. So perhaps the D used in the problem is 1e-9, not 1e-4.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using D in m²/s, and it's 1.3e-9, not cm²/s. So let's proceed with that.

So, D = 1.3e-9 m²/s.

D_eff = 1.3e-9 * 0.31 /4 ≈ 1.0075e-10 m²/s.

Then, J = (0.2 /0.0025) * 1.0075e-10 = 80 * 1.0075e-10 = 8.06e-9 kmol/(m²·s).

Which is approximately 8.06e-9, very close to option A:8.5e-9. But wait, looking at the options, option E is 7.5e-9, which is also close.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value without approximation. Let me calculate more precisely.

D_eff = (1.3e-9) * 0.31 /4.

0.31 /4 = 0.0775.

So D_eff = 1.3e-9 * 0.0775 = 1.0075e-10 m²/s.

Then, J = (0.2 / 0.0025) * 1.0075e-10 = 80 * 1.0075e-10 = 8.06e-9 kmol/(m²·s).

So, approximately 8.06e-9. The closest option is A:8.5e-9, but that's a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps I should carry more decimal places or check if the D is 1.2e-9.

Let me try D=1.2e-9 m²/s.

D_eff = 1.2e-9 * 0.31 /4 = (1.2e-9 *0.31) = 0.372e-9, divided by 4 is 0.093e-9 = 9.3e-11 m²/s.

Then J = 80 * 9.3e-11 = 7.44e-9 kmol/(m²·s), which is close to option E:7.5e-9.

Hmm, but why the discrepancy? Because the D value isn't given in the problem, I'm forced to make an assumption. If I take D=1.3e-9, I get 8.06e-9, close to option A. If I take D=1.2e-9, I get 7.44e-9, close to option E.

Wait, perhaps the correct D is 1.28e-9 m²/s, which would give J=8e-9, matching option A. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact value from literature.

Wait, upon checking, the diffusion coefficient for NaCl in water at 291 K (approximately 18°C) is around 1.28e-9 m²/s. So using that, D_eff = 1.28e-9 * 0.31 /4.

Calculating that: 1.28e-9 *0.31 = 0.3968e-9, divided by 4 is 0.0992e-9 = 9.92e-11 m²/s.

Then J = 80 * 9.92e-11 = 7.936e-9 kmol/(m²·s), which is approximately 7.94e-9, close to option A (8.5e-9) but a bit lower. Alternatively, perhaps I should round it to 8e-9, which isn't exactly an option, but option E is 7.5e-9, which is closer to 7.94e-9.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again:

If D=1.28e-9,

D_eff = 1.28e-9 *0.31 /4 = (1.28 *0.31) = 0.3968, divided by 4 is 0.0992e-9 =9.92e-11 m²/s.

Then J=80 *9.92e-11 = 80 *9.92e-11 = 7.936e-9.

So, 7.936e-9, which is approximately 7.94e-9.

Looking at the options, the closest is option E:7.5e-9, but that's a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the effective diffusion coefficient might also include the square of the tortuosity or something else.

Wait, perhaps the formula for D_eff is D * (ε/τ)^2. No, I think that's not correct. The standard formula is D_eff = D * ε / τ.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the concentration gradient is (c1 - c2)/(L * τ / ε), which would make the gradient smaller, thus J smaller.

Wait, let me try that approach.

So, L_eff = L * τ / ε = 0.0025 *4 /0.31 ≈0.032258 m.

Then, the gradient is (c1 - c2)/L_eff = 0.2 /0.032258 ≈6.196 kmol/m^4.

Then, J = D_eff * gradient.

D_eff =1.28e-9 *0.31 /4 =9.92e-11 m²/s.

So J=9.92e-11 *6.196 ≈6.146e-10 kmol/(m²·s).

Wait, that's 6.146e-10, which is 6.15e-10, way smaller than the options. That can't be right.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let me think about the formula for flux in a porous medium.

The general formula for steady-state diffusion in a porous medium is:

J = (D * ε / τ) * (c1 - c2) / (L * τ / ε)

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

J = (D * ε / τ) * (c1 - c2) / L_eff

Where L_eff = L * τ / ε.

So,

J = (D * ε / τ) * (c1 - c2) / (L * τ / ε)

Simplifying,

J = D * ε^2 (c1 - c2) / (τ^2 L)

Hmm, that might be the correct formula.

Let me plug in the numbers with D=1.28e-9 m²/s.

So,

J = (1.28e-9) * (0.31)^2 * (0.2) / (4^2 *0.0025).

Calculating numerator: 1.28e-9 *0.0961 *0.2 =1.28e-9 *0.01922 ≈2.465e-11.

Denominator: 16 *0.0025 =0.04.

So J=2.465e-11 /0.04 ≈6.1625e-10 kmol/(m²·s).

That's way too small, not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me go back to the original approach, assuming D=1.3e-9 m²/s, which gives J=8.06e-9, close to option A.

But the options don't have 8.06e-9. The closest is A:8.5e-9.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct D is 1.5e-9 m²/s, which would give J= (1.5e-9 *0.31 /4)*80 = (1.5e-9 *0.0775)*80=1.1625e-10 *80=9.3e-9, which is close to option B:9e-9.

But I'm not sure about the exact D value. Since the problem doesn't provide D, I have to make an assumption. If I assume D=1.3e-9, then J=8.06e-9, which is close to option A:8.5e-9.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E:7.5e-9, considering a D of around 1.2e-9.

But without the exact D value, it's hard to be precise. However, given the options, and considering that 1.3e-9 is a common value, the answer would be approximately 8e-9, which is closest to option A.

The problem involves calculating the steady-state diffusion of NaCl through a porous silica matrix. The key steps involve determining the effective diffusion coefficient \( D_{\text{eff}} \) using the formula \( D_{\text{eff}} = D \cdot \frac{\epsilon}{\tau} \), where \( D \) is the molecular diffusion coefficient, \( \epsilon \) is the void fraction, and \( \tau \) is the tortuosity. The flux \( J \) is then calculated using Fick's first law: \( J = \frac{(c_1 - c_2)}{L} \cdot D_{\text{eff}} \), where \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are the concentrations on either side of the matrix, and \( L \) is the thickness.

Given the parameters:
- \( \epsilon = 0.31 \)
- \( \tau = 4.0 \)
- \( L = 2.5 \, \text{mm} = 0.0025 \, \text{m} \)
- \( c_1 = 0.2 \, \text{kmol/m}^3 \)
- \( c_2 = 0 \, \text{kmol/m}^3 \) (assumed)

The molecular diffusion coefficient \( D \) for NaCl in water at 291 K is approximated as \( 1.3 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}^2/\text{s} \). Using this value, the effective diffusion coefficient is calculated as:

\[
D_{\text{eff}} = \frac{1.3 \times 10^{-9} \cdot 0.31}{4.0} \approx 1.0075 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}.
\]

The concentration gradient is:

\[
\frac{c_1 - c_2}{L} = \frac{0.2}{0.0025} = 80 \, \text{kmol/m}^4.
\]

The flux \( J \) is then:

\[
J = 80 \cdot 1.0075 \times 10^{-10} \approx 8.06 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{kmol/m}^2\text{-s}.
\]

This value is closest to option A (\( 8.50 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{kmol/m}^2\text{-s} \)). Considering potential variations in \( D \) and rounding, the answer aligns with option A.

**Answer: A**
