Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how much gain Decker has to recognize from selling his principal residence. Let me walk through this step by step.

First, the facts: Decker is 62 and single. He sold his principal residence for $500,000 after all selling expenses. He bought it 15 years ago and lived there until he sold it. On the sale date, the cost basis was $200,000. Within six months, he bought a new house for $600,000.

Wait, so the key here is understanding whether Decker has to recognize any gain on the sale. I remember that for a principal residence, there's an exclusion from taxable gain. The maximum exclusion is $250,000 for a single person. But there are conditions, like how long you've owned and lived in the home.

Decker owned the house for 15 years and used it as his principal residence until he sold it. That should satisfy the two out of five years ownership and use requirement. So, he might be able to exclude up to $250,000 of gain.

Let me calculate the gain. The selling price is $500,000. The cost basis is $200,000. So, the gain is $500,000 minus $200,000, which equals $300,000. 

But wait, the exclusion allows him to not pay taxes on up to $250,000 of that gain. So, the taxable gain would be $300,000 minus $250,000, which is $50,000. 

Wait, no, that's not right. The exclusion is the amount you can exclude, so the gain you actually report is the total gain minus the exclusion. So, $300k total gain minus $250k exclusion equals $50k taxable gain. So he would have to recognize $50,000 as taxable income.

But wait, the question is asking for the amount of gain he should recognize. So the answer should be $50,000, which is option A.

Wait, but I'm seeing that the options have A as $50,000 and J as $300,000. Hmm, but I think I might be mixing up something. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, maybe the exclusion applies, so he doesn't have to recognize any gain because the gain is under $250k? No, wait, the exclusion is up to $250k. If his gain is $300k, then he can exclude $250k, so he has to recognize $50k as gain. So yes, the answer should be $50,000, which is A.

But wait, did he buy a new house within six months? That's the other part. I think the purchase of a new home within six months might affect the exclusion. Oh right, the IRS allows an exclusion if you buy a new principal residence within two years. So, since he bought a new house within six months, he might be able to exclude the entire gain. Wait, no, the exclusion is based on whether you reinvest the proceeds into a new home. So, if you use the proceeds to buy a new principal residence within two years, the exclusion is allowed. So, if he's replacing his home, he might not have any taxable gain because he's reinvesting the proceeds.

Wait, but the cost basis was $200k, selling price $500k, so $300k gain. If he buys a new home, he can exclude up to $250k, but if he's replacing his home, maybe the entire gain is excluded. I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, the rule is that if you reinvest in a new home within two years, you can exclude up to $250k. So, in his case, his gain is $300k, but he can exclude $250k, so he's still left with $50k taxable gain, even if he buys a new home. Or maybe if he's replacing his home, he can exclude the entire gain. Wait, no, I think the replacement rule allows you to exclude the gain only if you're reinvesting, but the maximum exclusion is still $250k. So if he's replacing, he can exclude the full gain up to $250k, but if his gain is higher than that, he still has to pay taxes on the excess.

Wait, so if he sells for $500k, basis $200k, gain $300k. He buys a new home for $600k. So, the cost of the new home is $600k. The selling price of the old home was $500k. So, he's putting $500k towards the new home, and perhaps taking a mortgage. So, he's using the proceeds to buy a new home, which means he qualifies for the exclusion. So, he can exclude up to $250k of the gain, so the taxable gain is $300k - $250k = $50k. But wait, if he's replacing his home, maybe the exclusion is higher? No, no, the exclusion is capped at $250k for a single person.

Alternatively, perhaps when you replace your home, you can exclude the entire gain, regardless of the amount. But I think that's not correct. The replacement rule allows you to defer the gain, but the exclusion is up to $250k. So, if the gain is more than $250k, you still have to pay taxes on the excess.

Wait, no, perhaps if you reinvest the entire proceeds into a new home, you don't have any taxable gain. Because the idea is that you're not keeping the cash, so you don't have a taxable event. But I'm not sure about that. Let me think again.

The IRS allows a gain exclusion of up to $250k for a single filer when selling a principal residence, provided you meet the ownership and use tests. Additionally, if you reinvest the proceeds into a new home within two years, you can exclude the gain up to the amount necessary to buy the new home. So, if you sell for more than the cost, you can exclude the gain up to the amount you reinvest.

Wait, perhaps the formula is that the exclusion is the lesser of $250k or the gain, but if you reinvest, you can exclude the entire gain up to the amount needed to buy the new home. So, if he sells for $500k, cost $200k, gain $300k. He buys a new home for $600k. So, he's putting $500k towards the new home. But the cost is $600k, so he's taking a $100k mortgage or something else. But the key is that he's reinvesting the $500k into the new home, which is more than the gain of $300k. So, perhaps he can exclude the entire $300k gain because he's reinvesting all the proceeds into a more expensive home.

Wait, no, the exclusion is up to $250k regardless. Reinvesting allows you to exclude the gain up to the amount needed to buy the new home, but the cap is still $250k. So, if the gain is $300k, he can exclude $250k, and the remaining $50k is taxable.

Alternatively, maybe the fact that he's buying a more expensive home allows him to exclude the entire gain because the cost is higher. I'm a bit confused here. Let me check the rules.

The IRS says that if you sell your principal residence and buy a new one within two years, you can exclude the gain up to the amount necessary to buy the new home. So, if the new home costs more than the old, you can exclude the entire gain. So, in this case, the old home sold for $500k, new is $600k. So, he's putting $500k into the new home, but the new home costs $600k, so he's financing the remaining $100k. But the rule says you can exclude the gain up to the amount you used to buy the new home. So, the gain is $300k, but he's using $500k from the sale to buy the new home, which is more than the gain. So, he can exclude the entire $300k gain because he's reinvesting all the proceeds into a new home. Therefore, he doesn't have to recognize any gain, so the answer would be D: $0.

Wait, but the exclusion is up to $250k. So, even if he's reinvesting, the maximum exclusion is $250k. So, if the gain is $300k, he can exclude $250k, and the remaining $50k is taxable. So, he would have to recognize $50k, which is option A.

I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me clarify the rules. The general exclusion is up to $250k for a single person, provided you meet the ownership and use tests. Additionally, if you reinvest the proceeds into a new home within two years, you can exclude the gain up to the amount necessary to buy the new home. So, the exclusion is the lesser of $250k or the gain, but if you reinvest, you can exclude the entire gain as long as it's used for the new home.

Wait, no, the reinvestment allows you to exclude the gain up to the amount you spend on the new home, but the maximum is still $250k. So, if the gain is $300k and you reinvest $500k, you can exclude the entire $300k because the reinvestment exceeds the gain. So, in that case, the taxable gain is zero.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think with an example. Suppose you sell for $500k, cost $200k, gain $300k. You buy a new home for $600k. You use the $500k from the sale and take a $100k mortgage. Since the new home costs more, you're reinvesting all the proceeds, so the gain is excluded entirely. So, the taxable gain is $0.

But wait, another perspective: the maximum exclusion is $250k, regardless of reinvestment. So, even if you reinvest, you can only exclude up to $250k. So, in this case, the gain is $300k, so you exclude $250k, and the remaining $50k is taxable.

I'm getting conflicting information. Maybe I should look up the exact rule. From what I recall, the reinvestment allows you to exclude the gain up to the amount you spent on the new home, but the maximum exclusion is still $250k. So, if the gain is $300k and you reinvest all $500k, you can exclude the entire $300k because the reinvestment covers the gain. Therefore, the taxable gain is $0.

But I'm not 100% sure. Let me try another angle. The IRS says that if you meet the ownership and use tests, you can exclude up to $250k. Additionally, if you reinvest the proceeds into a new home within two years, you can exclude any gain up to the cost of the new home. So, if the new home costs more than the selling price, you can exclude the entire gain because the reinvestment covers the entire gain.

So, in this case, the gain is $300k, and he's using $500k to buy a $600k home. Since the reinvestment exceeds the gain, he can exclude the entire $300k gain. Therefore, he doesn't have to recognize any gain, so the answer is D: $0.

Wait, but the cost basis is $200k, selling price $500k, so gain is $300k. He buys a new home for $600k, which is more than the selling price. So, he's reinvesting the $500k and perhaps more. The rule says that you can exclude the gain if you reinvest in a new home. So, the gain is $300k, and he's using all the proceeds plus more to buy a new home, so he can exclude the entire $300k gain. Therefore, the taxable gain is $0, so option D.

But I'm still a bit uncertain because I thought the exclusion was capped at $250k. Maybe the reinvestment allows you to exclude up to the amount needed to buy the new home, but not exceeding the $250k. But in this case, the gain is $300k, which is more than $250k, so he can only exclude $250k, leaving $50k taxable. So, the answer would be A: $50,000.

Wait, but the cost of the new home is $600k, which is more than the selling price of $500k. So, he's taking $500k from the sale and a $100k mortgage to buy a $600k home. So, he's reinvesting the $500k, which is the entire proceeds, into the new home. Therefore, he can exclude the entire gain of $300k because he's reinvesting all the proceeds. Therefore, no taxable gain, so D: $0.

I think that's correct. Because the reinvestment allows you to exclude the gain up to the amount you reinvest. Since he's reinvesting all $500k into a new home, which costs more, he can exclude the entire gain of $300k. So, the answer is D: $0.

Decker, a 62-year-old single individual, sold his principal residence for $500,000 after all selling expenses. He bought the house 15 years ago for $200,000, resulting in a gain of $300,000. Within six months, he purchased a new house for $600,000, using the proceeds from the sale to reinvest in a new principal residence.

Under IRS rules, a single individual can exclude up to $250,000 of gain from the sale of a principal residence if they meet the ownership and use requirements. Additionally, if the proceeds from the sale are reinvested into a new principal residence within two years, the gain can be excluded up to the amount necessary to purchase the new home. Since Decker reinvested the $500,000 from the sale into a new home costing $600,000, he is eligible to exclude the entire gain of $300,000 because he reinvested all the proceeds. Therefore, Decker does not have to recognize any gain from the sale.

Answer: D
