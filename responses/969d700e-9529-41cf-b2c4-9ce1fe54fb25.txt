Okay, so I've got this accounting question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about free retained earnings after a reserve increases by $10,000. The data provided is:

Retained Earnings: Reserved for contingencies $25,000
Reserved for plant expansion $20,000
Total reserves $45,000
Free retained earnings $50,000
Total retained earnings $95,000

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the terms here. From what I remember, "reserved for contingencies" and "reserved for plant expansion" are probably different types of reserves. Retained earnings is the money not paid out as dividends. There's "free retained earnings" which is the part that's not used for these reserve purposes. And "total retained earnings" would be the sum of free retained earnings and the other reserves.

So, the question is, what happens to free retained earnings if the reserve for contingencies increases by $10,000.

Let me break it down. First, the current values:

- Contingencies reserved: $25,000
- Plant expansion reserved: $20,000
- Total reserves: $45,000
- Free retained earnings: $50,000
- Total retained earnings: $95,000.

Wait, if I add the two reserves, 25k + 20k, that's 45k, which matches the total reserves. So that adds up.

Now, the free retained earnings are the part of retained earnings not allocated to these reserves. How much is that? Oh, maybe the free is the total minus the reserves. So, free = total - reserves. That would be 95k - 45k = 50k, which matches what's given.

But the question is, if the contingencies reserve increases by $10k, how does that affect free retained earnings. Hmm.

Wait, no. The contingency reserve is a reserve, so increasing it would mean taking more from retained earnings. But I thought "free retained earnings" is the retained earnings not used for these reserves. So, if the reserve increases, we take more away from retained earnings, which would reduce free retained earnings.

Wait, but in this case, the free retained earnings are $50k. So if we increase the contingency reserve by $10k, the total reserves would go from 45k to 55k. But wait, that can't be right because the total retained earnings would then have to be higher. Or does it?

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me clarify.

Total retained earnings is the sum of:

- Free retained earnings
- Contingencies reserved
- Plant expansion reserved.

So, if we increase the contingency reserve by $10k, that would take more away from retained earnings. So, the free retained earnings would decrease by $10k.

Wait, but in the question, the free retained earnings are $50k. The contingency reserve is $25k. If that increases by $10k, the new contingency reserve is $35k.

The total reserves would then be 35k (contingencies) +20k (plant) = 55k.

But the total retained earnings are total reserves, which would be 55k. But if the free retained earnings were to change, the free would be total retained earnings minus the new total reserves.

Wait, the question says what happens to the free retained earnings. So, initially, free is 50k. After increasing contingency reserve by 10k, new contingency is 35k, and new total reserves would be 35k +20k =55k.

But the total retained earnings would be 55k, and free retained earnings would be total (55k) minus new total reserves (55k) = 0k. So free retained earnings would decrease by 10k, from 50k to 40k.

Wait, but looking at the options, 40k is option A.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: perhaps the contingency reserve is part of retained earnings, so increasing it would mean taking more from retained earnings, which would reduce the free retained earnings.

Alternatively, perhaps the free retained earnings are computed as total retained earnings minus the sum of all reserves. So, if the sum of reserves goes up, even if the free increased, that would have to be considered.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

Total retained earnings = free + contingency + plant.

So, if contingency increases by 10k, the new free would be (total retained earnings) - (contingency + plant). So, if total retained earnings remains the same, free would go down by 10k. But if total retained earnings increases, free would go up.

But the question doesn't state whether total retained earnings (total retained) is increasing or not. It just says that the contingency reserve increases. So perhaps the total retained earnings is fixed, or it's not specified.

Wait, the question says, "find what would happen to the free amount if the reserve for contingencies to were to increase by $10,000."

Ah, so the contingency reserve is part of the total. So, if contingency increases by 10k, the total reserves would be 45k +10k =55k.

But what is the total retained earnings? It's not given. Wait, the initial setup says "Total reserves $45,000", and "Free retained earnings $50,000", "Total retained earnings $95,000."

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is about the change in free retained earnings when the contingency reserve increases by 10k.

So, initially:

Free retained earnings = Total retained earnings - (contingency + plant).

Which is 95k - (25k +20k) =95k -45k=50k.

After the contingency increases by 10k, new contingency reserve is 35k.

If the total retained earnings were the same, then new free would be 95k -55k=40k. So free would decrease by 10k.

But if total retained earnings increases, but the question doesn't say that, I think the assumption is that total retained earnings remains the same. Or perhaps the contingency reserve is just a part of the retained earnings, so when it increases, the free decreases.

So the answer would be a decrease of 10k. Looking at the options, that's option A, which is 40k.

But let me make sure I'm interpreting the question correctly.

The question is, what happens to free retained earnings if the contingency reserve increases by 10k.

So the free retained earnings are calculated as total retained earnings minus all the reserves. So if the contingency reserve increases, the total reserves increase, which would cause the free retained earnings to decrease by the same amount.

So, original free: 50k. After +10k in contingency, new free: 50k -10k=40k. So the answer is option A: 40k.

The question asks what happens to free retained earnings if the reserve for contingencies increases by $10,000. 

Initially, free retained earnings are calculated as total retained earnings minus the sum of all reserves. From the data provided:

- Total retained earnings = $95,000
- Contingencies reserved = $25,000
- Plant expansion reserved = $20,000
- Total reserves = $45,000

Free retained earnings = Total retained earnings - Total reserves = $95,000 - $45,000 = $50,000.

If the contingency reserve increases by $10,000, the new contingency reserve becomes $35,000. Assuming the total retained earnings remain unchanged, the new total reserves would be $55,000. Therefore, the new free retained earnings would be:

Free retained earnings = Total retained earnings - Total reserves = $95,000 - $55,000 = $40,000.

Thus, free retained earnings decrease by $10,000. Among the options, the correct answer is **A: $40,000**.
