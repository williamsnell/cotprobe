Okay, so I've got this problem here about choosing 3 cards from a standard deck, and all three have to be of different suits. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on combinatorics, but let me try to work through this step by step.

First, I remember that a standard deck has 52 cards, divided equally into 4 suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit has 13 cards. So, when the question says all three cards must be of different suits, that means each card must come from a unique suit. But wait, since there are only 4 suits, and we're choosing 3 cards, that leaves one suit unused. Interesting.

Let me think about how to approach this. I think it's a combination problem because the order doesn't matter. So I need to calculate how many ways to choose 3 suits out of 4, and then for each of those suits, choose one card.

Wait, that makes sense. So first, choose 3 suits from the 4 available. The number of ways to do that is the combination of 4 taken 3 at a time. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!). So C(4,3) would be 4! / (3!1!) = (4×3×2×1)/( (3×2×1)(1) ) = 4. So there are 4 ways to choose the suits.

Now, for each of those 3 suits, we need to choose one card. Each suit has 13 cards, so for the first suit, there are 13 choices, the second also 13, and the third 13 as well. So that would be 13 × 13 × 13 = 13³. Let me calculate that: 13 ×13 is 169, then 169 ×13. Let me do that step by step. 169 ×10 is 1690, 169 ×3 is 507, so adding them gives 2197. So 13³ is 2197.

Now, since there are 4 ways to choose the suits, the total number of ways would be 4 × 2197. Wait, but wait a second. That doesn't sound right because I think I might be overcounting. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as first selecting one card from each of three suits. So, the number of ways is the number of ways to choose 3 suits multiplied by the product of choosing one card from each of those suits.

So, C(4,3) is 4, and then for each of those 3 suits, 13 choices each. So 4 × (13 ×13 ×13) = 4 ×2197. Let me calculate that. 2000 ×4 is 8000, 197 ×4 is 788, so 8000 +788 = 8788.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another approach could be to consider all possible combinations where each card is from a different suit. So, the first card can be any card, so 52 choices. The second card has to be from a different suit than the first, so there are 39 choices (since 52 -13=39). The third card has to be from a different suit than both the first and second, so 26 choices (52 -13 -13=26). But since the order doesn't matter, I need to divide by the number of permutations of the three cards, which is 3! =6.

So that would be (52 ×39 ×26) / 6. Let me compute that. 52 ×39 is, let's see, 50×39=1950, plus 2×39=78, so 1950 +78=2028. Then 2028 ×26. Let's break that down: 2000×26=52,000 and 28×26=728. So 52,000 +728=52,728. Now, divide by 6: 52,728 ÷6. Let's see, 6 ×8,788 is 52,728, because 6 ×8,000=48,000, 6 ×788=4,728. Adding those gives 52,728. So 52,728 /6 =8,788.

So that's the same answer as before, 8,788. So that's option B. 

Wait, but earlier I thought of it as 4 ×13³, which is 4 ×2197 =8788, which matches. So both methods give me the same result. So I think the correct answer is 8788, which is option B.

To determine the number of ways to choose 3 cards from a standard deck of 52 cards such that all three cards are of different suits, we can approach the problem in two ways:

### Method 1: Choosing Suits and Then Cards
1. **Choose 3 suits out of 4**: The number of ways to choose 3 suits from 4 is given by the combination formula:
   \[
   C(4, 3) = 4
   \]
2. **Choose one card from each selected suit**: Each suit has 13 cards, so for the 3 selected suits, the number of ways to choose one card from each is:
   \[
   13 \times 13 \times 13 = 13^3 = 2197
   \]
3. **Multiply the two results**: The total number of ways is:
   \[
   4 \times 2197 = 8788
   \]

### Method 2: Considering Order and Adjusting for Permutations
1. **Choose the first card**: There are 52 possible choices.
2. **Choose the second card**: It must be from a different suit than the first, leaving 39 choices.
3. **Choose the third card**: It must be from a different suit than the first two, leaving 26 choices.
4. **Adjust for order**: Since the order of selection does not matter, divide by the number of permutations of 3 cards, which is \(3!\):
   \[
   \frac{52 \times 39 \times 26}{3!} = \frac{52 \times 39 \times 26}{6} = \frac{52728}{6} = 8788
   \]

Both methods yield the same result: **8788**.

**Answer:** B
