Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question. Let's see, the question is about how the chair of the central bank would respond to Congress's expansionary fiscal policy to reduce the crowding-out effect and what macroeconomic problem that might cause.

First, I need to understand what's being asked. Congress is using expansionary fiscal policy, which usually involves increasing government spending or cutting taxes to boost employment and economic activity. This is typically done during a recession to stimulate the economy.

Now, the central bank's role here is to counteract any negative effects, specifically the "crowding-out" effect. Crowding out happens when the government's increased borrowing for its spending pushes up interest rates, which can discourage private investment because it becomes more expensive to borrow money. So, the central bank might try to lower interest rates to prevent this from happening too much.

As the chair, what tools do I have? The central bank can use monetary policy tools like adjusting the discount rate, changing the reserve ratio, or buying/selling government securities. The goal is to reduce the crowding-out effect, so I want to lower interest rates.

If the government is increasing spending (expansionary fiscal policy), it might borrow more, increasing the demand for loans. This would tend to push up interest rates. To counteract that, the central bank can lower the interest rate it charges to banks (discount rate) or buy government securities, which would increase the money supply and lower interest rates.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Buy government securities risking a recessionary gap. Buying securities would increase the money supply, which could lower interest rates, helping to reduce crowding-out. But a recessionary gap is when the economy is below potential GDP, so if they're trying to boost employment, maybe not the risk here. But this could help.

Option B: Increase the discount rate risking deflation. Increasing the discount rate would make it more expensive for banks to borrow, leading them to raise loan rates. This would increase interest rates, which would worsen the crowding-out effect, not reduce it. So B seems wrong.

Option C: Sell less government securities risking deflation. Selling securities would reduce the money supply, but if they're selling less, it's like keeping more in the market, which would increase the money supply. Wait, no, selling securities by the central bank actually reduces the money supply because they take money out of circulation. So if they sell less, that would mean more money in the economy, which is expansionary. But the risk is deflation, which is when prices fall. But if the economy is already being stimulated by fiscal policy, maybe deflation isn't the main risk. Hmm, not sure yet.

Option D: Increase the reserve ratio risking devaluation. Increasing the reserve ratio means banks have to hold more reserves, which reduces the money they can lend out, decreasing the money supply. This would make borrowing more expensive, increasing interest rates, which is bad for crowding-out. Plus, devaluation of the dollar is about exchange rates, not directly related here. So D is probably not the answer.

Option E: Lower the reserve ratio risking devaluation. Lowering the reserve ratio allows banks to lend more, increasing the money supply. This would lower interest rates, reducing the crowding-out effect. But could it risk devaluation? Lowering interest rates might make the dollar less attractive, possibly leading to depreciation. So E is a possibility.

Option F: Decrease the reserve ratio risking inflation. Decreasing the reserve ratio is the same as lowering it, which would increase lending and the money supply. This could risk inflation because more money in circulation can lead to higher prices. So F is another option.

Option G: Sell government securities risking inflation. Selling securities reduces the money supply, which would increase interest rates, worsening crowding-out. So G is not helpful.

Option H: Lower the discount rate risking inflation. Lowering the discount rate would make it cheaper for banks to borrow from the central bank, which could lead them to lower their lending rates. This would reduce interest rates, helping with crowding-out. But lower rates can lead to more borrowing and potentially inflation. So H is a possibility.

Option I: Buy more government securities risking hyperinflation. Buying more securities increases the money supply, which can lower interest rates and reduce crowding-out. But buying a lot could lead to hyperinflation if the money supply grows too fast. So I is an option.

Option J: Increase government spending risking a budget deficit. But the question is about the central bank's action, not the government's spending. So J is probably not relevant here.

Now, the question asks what the central bank would do to reduce crowding-out and what problem that might cause. So the action should be an expansionary monetary policy.

Looking back, options A, E, F, H, I are all about lowering rates or increasing money supply. The crowding-out effect is about higher interest rates, so the central bank would want to lower rates or increase money supply to keep rates low.

If the government is increasing spending (expansionary fiscal), it's borrowing more, which increases the demand for loanable funds, pushing up interest rates. The central bank can respond by buying more government securities, which increases the money supply and lowers interest rates. That's what option I suggests. But buying more could risk hyperinflation if taken too far.

Alternatively, lowering the discount rate (option H) or decreasing the reserve ratio (option F) would also lower interest rates and increase money supply. Each comes with different risks.

The question is asking what the chair would do and what problem it might exacerbate. So the action should be to reduce interest rates, and the side effect could be inflation.

Looking at the options, option H says lower discount rate risking inflation. Option F says decrease reserve ratio risking inflation. Option E says lower reserve ratio risking devaluation.

Wait, the question is about reducing crowding-out. So the correct action is to lower interest rates. Which options do that?

Option H: Lower discount rate would lower banks' borrowing costs, possibly leading to lower lending rates. That reduces crowding-out.

Option E: Lowering reserve ratio allows more lending, which can lower interest rates as more funds are available.

Similarly, option I is about buying more securities, which injects more money, lowering rates.

But the problem is that the central bank's action might cause another issue. For example, if they lower the discount rate (H), it might lead to more borrowing and spending, risking inflation. Similarly, buying more securities (I) could risk hyperinflation.

But the question is about the chair's response and the macroeconomic problem. So the action should be to reduce crowding-out, so the chair would take an action that lowers interest rates.

Alternatively, the central bank might sell less government securities. Wait, option C says sell less risking deflation. Selling less would mean keeping more money in circulation, which is expansionary, but if they don't sell, it might not have a big impact. Alternatively, buying more (I) is more expansionary.

Wait, the correct approach is that when the government is expanding fiscal policy, the central bank can do expansionary monetary policy to support it, but if they do too much, it might cause inflation.

Wait, but the question is about reducing the crowding-out effect. So the central bank's action would be to make borrowing cheaper, so either lower interest rates or increase money supply.

So, the options that help are H, E, F, I.

Now, the other part is what macroeconomic problem might this policy exacerbate.

If the central bank lowers the discount rate (H), it could lead to more borrowing, potentially causing inflation. Similarly, buying more securities (I) could lead to hyperinflation.

But which option is the best fit?

The question says the central bank wants to reduce the crowding-out effect. So the correct action is to lower the interest rates or increase the money supply.

Looking at the options, the correct action is likely to buy more government securities (I), which would increase the money supply and lower interest rates, thus reducing crowding-out. But this could risk hyperinflation.

But another possibility is lowering the reserve ratio (E or F). Lowering the reserve ratio (option E) would allow banks to lend more, increasing the money supply and lowering interest rates. The risk here is devaluation, but that's more about exchange rates. Alternatively, decreasing the reserve ratio (option F) could risk inflation.

So, which option is the best? The question says the central bank is trying to reduce the crowding-out effect, which is about higher interest rates. So the correct action is to lower interest rates or increase money supply.

Option H: Lower discount rate risking inflation. That would make it cheaper for banks to borrow, leading to lower lending rates, reducing crowding-out. The risk is inflation.

Option I: Buy more securities risking hyperinflation. That also reduces interest rates and increases money supply, but hyperinflation is a more severe form.

Alternatively, option F: Decrease the reserve ratio risking inflation. That also increases the money supply, lowering interest rates.

But the question is about the chair's action and the problem it might cause. So the correct answer would pair the action that reduces crowding-out and the risk.

Wait, the options are a bit tricky. Let me think again.

Expansionary fiscal policy (government spending up) leads to higher demand for loanable funds, increasing interest rates. The central bank can lower the interest rates by buying government securities (which increases the money supply and lowers rates), or by lowering the discount rate or reserve ratio.

If the central bank buys more government securities (option I), that directly reduces the interest rates on those securities, which are a benchmark. So that's a direct way to lower interest rates and reduce crowding-out. However, buying a lot can risk hyperinflation.

Alternatively, if they lower the discount rate (option H), it's another way to lower borrowing costs for banks, which can lower lending rates. But this also could lead to more borrowing and spending, risking inflation.

So, the action would be either I or H.

Looking back at the options, the correct answer is probably H: Lower the discount rate risking inflation.

Wait, but another angle: when the government runs a budget deficit due to expansionary fiscal policy, it borrows, which increases the demand for loans. The central bank can respond by buying government securities, which would inject money into the economy, lowering interest rates. This is called monetizing the debt. So that's what option I suggests. But if they buy too much, it could cause hyperinflation.

Alternatively, the central bank might lower the reserve ratio (E or F) or discount rate (H) to encourage more lending and lower rates.

But the question is about the chair's action to reduce crowding-out. So the most direct way is to buy more government securities, which is option I. But that risks hyperinflation.

Wait, but another thought: when the government increases spending, it can push up interest rates. The central bank can lower the interest rates by cutting the discount rate or buying securities. If they cut the discount rate (H), that's one way. If they buy more (I), that's another.

I think the correct answer is H: Lower the discount rate risking inflation. Because lowering the discount rate directly affects the cost of borrowing for banks, leading to lower interest rates on loans, thus reducing crowding-out. The risk is that lower rates can lead to more borrowing and higher demand, potentially causing inflation.

Alternatively, buying more government securities (I) would also lower rates but could risk hyperinflation if done excessively.

Hmm. I'm a bit torn between H and I.

Wait, the question also asks what macroeconomic problem might the policy exacerbate. So, if the central bank lowers the discount rate (H), the risk is inflation. If they buy more securities (I), the risk is hyperinflation.

Which is more likely? Well, hyperinflation is a more extreme version of inflation, so if the policy is too expansionary, it could lead to that.

But the question is about what problem might be exacerbated. So the action would have a certain risk.

In the context of the options, the correct answer is probably H: Lower the discount rate risking inflation.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: the crowding-out effect is when government borrowing displaces private investment. To reduce this, the central bank can lower interest rates, making borrowing cheaper for both the government and the private sector. So, the central bank's action should be to lower interest rates, which can be done by buying securities (I), lowering discount rate (H), or lowering reserve ratio (E or F).

But which option is the best fit?

Looking at the options again:

Option H: Lower discount rate risking inflation.

Option I: Buy more government securities risking hyperinflation.

Option E: Lower reserve ratio risking devaluation.

Option F: Decrease reserve ratio risking inflation.

I think the correct answer is H: Lower the discount rate risking inflation.

Wait, but wait another thought: the reserve ratio is the amount banks must hold as reserves. Lowering it allows banks to lend more, increasing the money supply, which lowers interest rates. So option F says decrease reserve ratio risking inflation. That would also reduce crowding-out.

So now I'm confused between H and F.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is to sell less government securities, which would mean not withdrawing money from the economy as much. Wait, option C says sell less risking deflation. No, selling less would mean more money in the economy, which is expansionary, but the risk is deflation if the economy is already weak. But if the economy is being boosted by fiscal policy, deflation isn't the main risk. So maybe C isn't the right choice.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to recall: the crowding-out effect is when government borrowing leads to higher interest rates, reducing private investment. To counteract, the central bank can lower interest rates through buying securities, lowering discount rate, or lowering reserve ratio.

The question is asking what the chair would do and what problem it might cause.

The correct action is to lower interest rates, which can be done in several ways. The options that do that are H, E, F, I.

Now, the problem that arises is inflation. So the correct answer is likely either H or F.

Alternatively, if the central bank buys more government securities (I), that's another way, risking hyperinflation.

But I think the most direct way to reduce the crowding-out effect is for the central bank to lower the discount rate, making it cheaper for banks to borrow, which can lower their lending rates. So H is the answer.

Wait, but I'm still not 100% sure. Another approach: expansionary fiscal policy increases AD, which can lead to higher prices if the economy is near full capacity. The central bank's expansionary monetary policy (lowering rates or increasing money supply) can exacerbate inflation.

So, the correct answer is H: Lower the discount rate risking inflation.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option H is "Lower the discount rate risking inflation." That makes sense because lowering the discount rate would encourage banks to borrow more from the central bank at a lower rate, which can then lend more to businesses and consumers, lowering interest rates and reducing crowding-out. However, too much lending can overheat the economy, leading to inflation.

Alternatively, option I is "Buy more government securities risking hyperinflation." Buying more would increase the money supply, which can lower interest rates, but if done excessively, could cause hyperinflation.

So, the question is, which action is the central bank taking to reduce crowding-out, and what problem does it cause.

I think the correct answer is H: Lower the discount rate risking inflation.

Wait, but another angle: when the government increases spending, it's increasing the demand for loanable funds, pushing up interest rates. The central bank can buy government securities, which would reduce the yield on those securities, lowering interest rates. So option I is about buying more, which directly targets the interest rate on government bonds, thus reducing crowding-out.

So, if the central bank buys more (option I), it reduces the interest rates, which helps with crowding-out. The risk is hyperinflation.

But the question is about what problem might be exacerbated. So, if they buy more, the risk is hyperinflation.

So perhaps the correct answer is I.

But I'm getting stuck between H and I.

Wait, let me think about the roles. The discount rate is the rate the central bank charges banks for loans. Lowering it makes it cheaper for banks to borrow, which can lead to lower lending rates. This would help reduce crowding-out.

Buying government securities directly affects the government's borrowing cost, lowering it, which also reduces crowding-out.

So, both H and I are possible, but which one is more directly related to reducing the crowding-out effect?

I think buying more government securities (I) directly impacts the government's borrowing cost, which is more targeted towards reducing the crowding-out effect. So option I is the action, risking hyperinflation.

But the question is a bit tricky because it's asking what the chair would do and what problem it might cause.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H: Lower the discount rate risking inflation.

Wait, but the options are a bit confusing. Let me check the options again.

The question is: reduce the crowding-out effect and what macroeconomic problem might your policy exacerbate.

So, the correct action is to lower interest rates, which can be done by buying securities, lowering discount rate, or lowering reserve ratio.

The problem that arises is inflation.

So the correct answer would be the action that lowers rates and the risk of inflation.

Looking at the options, H and F are about lowering rates and inflation.

Option H: Lower the discount rate risking inflation.

Option F: Decrease the reserve ratio risking inflation.

Which is the correct action?

I think the answer is H: Lower the discount rate risking inflation.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I: Buy more government securities risking hyperinflation.

Wait, but the question is about what the chair would do, not necessarily the most extreme action. Lowering the discount rate is a standard tool to reduce interest rates.

I think the correct answer is H: Lower the discount rate risking inflation.
</think>

The question involves determining how the central bank would reduce the "crowding-out" effect caused by Congress's expansionary fiscal policy and identify the macroeconomic problem that might arise. Crowding-out occurs when government borrowing increases interest rates, discouraging private investment. To mitigate this, the central bank can lower interest rates or increase the money supply through monetary policy tools like adjusting the discount rate, reserve ratio, or buying/selling government securities.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Buying government securities increases the money supply and lowers interest rates, reducing crowding-out. However, it risks a recessionary gap, which is less relevant here as the goal is to boost employment.
- **Option B**: Increasing the discount rate would raise borrowing costs, worsening crowding-out, making it counterproductive.
- **Option C**: Selling less government securities keeps more money in circulation, which is expansionary. However, the risk of deflation is less likely given the context of boosting employment.
- **Option D**: Increasing the reserve ratio reduces lending and raises interest rates, worsening crowding-out, so it is not suitable.
- **Option E**: Lowering the reserve ratio allows banks to lend more, increasing the money supply and lowering interest rates, which helps reduce crowding-out. The risk is devaluation, but this is less directly related to the macroeconomic problem.
- **Option F**: Decreasing the reserve ratio similarly increases lending and money supply, lowering interest rates. The risk is inflation, which aligns with the potential macroeconomic problem.
- **Option G**: Selling government securities reduces the money supply, raising interest rates and worsening crowding-out, so it is incorrect.
- **Option H**: Lowering the discount rate reduces borrowing costs for banks, encouraging lower lending rates and reducing crowding-out. The risk is inflation, which is a plausible macroeconomic problem.
- **Option I**: Buying more government securities increases the money supply and lowers interest rates, directly addressing crowding-out. However, the risk is hyperinflation, which is more severe than inflation.
- **Option J**: Increasing government spending is not a central bank action and is irrelevant here.

### Conclusion:
The central bank's goal is to reduce crowding-out by lowering interest rates or increasing the money supply. Both **Option H (Lower the discount rate risking inflation)** and **Option F (Decrease the reserve ratio risking inflation)** achieve this. However, lowering the discount rate (Option H) is a more direct tool for reducing borrowing costs and aligns with the risk of inflation. Therefore, the best answer is:

**H: Lower the discount rate risking inflation.**
