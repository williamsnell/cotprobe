Okay, so I have this logic problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because truth tables have always been a bit tricky for me. But I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is to construct a complete truth table for two propositions: ~(J ∨ K) · L and (L ⊃ J) · K. Then, using the truth tables, I need to determine whether these statements are logically equivalent, contradictory, consistent, or inconsistent. The options are from A to I, and I have to choose the correct one.

Alright, first, let me make sure I understand the propositions correctly. The first one is ~(J ∨ K) · L. So that's the negation of (J OR K) combined with L using the AND operator. The second proposition is (L implies J) AND K. So I have two compound propositions connected by AND in each case.

I think the best approach is to break down each part and then build the truth table. Let's list all possible truth values for J and K because there are two variables, so there are 2^2 = 4 possible combinations. Then, for each combination, I can compute the truth values step by step.

Let me write down the variables J and K and their possible truth values:

1. J = T, K = T
2. J = T, K = F
3. J = F, K = T
4. J = F, K = F

For each of these, I need to compute the value of each part of the propositions.

Starting with the first proposition: ~(J ∨ K) · L.

Wait, but L is another variable. Oh wait, no, the problem as given doesn't mention L as a separate variable. Wait, looking back: the first proposition is ~(J ∨ K) · L, and the second is (L ⊃ J) · K. Hmm, so I have three variables: J, K, and L. Oh no, I didn't realize that. So the truth table needs to consider all possible combinations of J, K, and L. That's 2^3 = 8 rows. Oh, that's more work, but manageable.

So I'll list all 8 possible combinations of J, K, L.

Let me list them:

1. J=T, K=T, L=T
2. J=T, K=T, L=F
3. J=T, K=F, L=T
4. J=T, K=F, L=F
5. J=F, K=T, L=T
6. J=F, K=T, L=F
7. J=F, K=F, L=T
8. J=F, K=F, L=F

Now, for each of these, I need to compute the value of each proposition.

Let me tackle the first proposition: ~(J ∨ K) · L.

Breaking it down:

First, compute J ∨ K. Then negate it, and then AND with L.

Similarly, the second proposition is (L ⊃ J) · K.

Breaking that down: Compute L implies J (which is equivalent to ~L ∨ J), then AND with K.

So, for each row, I'll compute each part step by step.

Let me create a table with columns: J, K, L, then compute J∨K, ~ (J∨K), ~(J∨K) · L, which is the first proposition. Then compute L ⊃ J (which is ~L ∨ J), then compute (L ⊃ J) · K, which is the second proposition. Then I'll compare the two propositions in each row.

Let me start filling in the rows one by one.

Row 1: J=T, K=T, L=T

Compute J∨K: T∨T = T

~(J∨K) = ~T = F

Then ~(J∨K) · L: F · T = F

Now for the second proposition:

L ⊃ J: T ⊃ T. Since an implication is only false when the antecedent is T and consequent is F. So T ⊃ T is T.

Then (L ⊃ J) · K: T · T = T

So first proposition is F, second is T. Not equal.

Row 1: F vs T → Not equivalent.

Row 2: J=T, K=T, L=F

J∨K: T∨T = T

~(J∨K) = F

~(J∨K) · L: F · F = F

Second proposition:

L ⊃ J: F ⊃ T. Since F implies anything is T, so T.

Then (L ⊃ J) · K: T · T = T

So first proposition F, second T. Not equal.

Row 2: F vs T → Not equivalent.

Row 3: J=T, K=F, L=T

J∨K: T∨F = T

~(J∨K) = F

~(J∨K) · L: F · T = F

Second proposition:

L ⊃ J: T ⊃ T = T

Then (L ⊃ J) · K: T · F = F

So first proposition F, second F. They are equal here. So same value.

Row 3: Both F → Equal.

Row 4: J=T, K=F, L=F

J∨K: T∨F = T

~(J∨K) = F

~(J∨K) · L: F · F = F

Second proposition:

L ⊃ J: F ⊃ T = T

Then (L ⊃ J) · K: T · F = F

So first proposition F, second F. Equal.

Row 4: Both F → Equal.

Row 5: J=F, K=T, L=T

J∨K: F∨T = T

~(J∨K) = F

~(J∨K) · L: F · T = F

Second proposition:

L ⊃ J: T ⊃ F. This is F because if L is T and J is F, the implication is F.

Then (L ⊃ J) · K: F · T = F

So first proposition F, second F. Equal.

Row 5: Both F → Equal.

Row 6: J=F, K=T, L=F

J∨K: F∨T = T

~(J∨K) = F

~(J∨K) · L: F · F = F

Second proposition:

L ⊃ J: F ⊃ F. Implication is T when both are F.

Then (L ⊃ J) · K: T · T = T

So first proposition F, second T. Not equal.

Row 6: F vs T → Not equal.

Row 7: J=F, K=F, L=T

J∨K: F∨F = F

~(J∨K) = T

~(J∨K) · L: T · T = T

Second proposition:

L ⊃ J: T ⊃ F = F

Then (L ⊃ J) · K: F · F = F

So first proposition T, second F. Not equal.

Row 7: T vs F → Not equal.

Row 8: J=F, K=F, L=F

J∨K: F∨F = F

~(J∨K) = T

~(J∨K) · L: T · F = F

Second proposition:

L ⊃ J: F ⊃ F = T

Then (L ⊃ J) · K: T · F = F

So first proposition F, second F. Equal.

Row 8: Both F → Equal.

Now, let me summarize the results for each row.

Row 1: F vs T → Not equal
Row 2: F vs T → Not equal
Row 3: F vs F → Equal
Row 4: F vs F → Equal
Row 5: F vs F → Equal
Row 6: F vs T → Not equal
Row 7: T vs F → Not equal
Row 8: F vs F → Equal

So, in rows 3,4,5,8, both propositions are equal. In rows 1,2,6,7, they are not equal.

Now, to determine if they are logically equivalent, the propositions must have the same truth value in all rows. Since in some rows they differ, they are not logically equivalent.

Next, are they contradictory? Contradictory means they are always opposite—so whenever one is T, the other is F, and vice versa. But looking at the results, that's not the case. For example, in row 3, both are F. So they are not contradictory.

Next, are they consistent? Consistent means that there is at least one row where both are true. Wait, no, actually, in logic, two statements are consistent if they can both be true at the same time. So if there's any row where both are T, then they're consistent. Looking at the results, in row 3,4,5,8, both are F. In row 1: F and T, row 2: F and T, row 6: F and T, row7: T and F. So where are both T? I don't see any row where both are T. Hmm. Wait, let's check each row again.

Looking at all 8 rows:

Row 1: F vs T → First is F, second is T.

Row 2: F vs T → Same.

Row3: F and F.

Row4: F and F.

Row5: F and F.

Row6: F and T.

Row7: T and F.

Row8: F and F.

So in no row are both propositions T. So they are never both true at the same time. So are they consistent?

Wait, the definition of consistency is that they do not contradict each other. If two statements are such that there is no row where both are false, then they are inconsistent. Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, actually, in logic, two statements are consistent if they are not contradictory. That is, if there is at least one row where both are true, then they are consistent. If they are always contradictory (i.e., in every row, one is T and the other F), then they are contradictory. But in our case, they are not always contradictory because in some rows both are F. So they are not contradictory.

But for consistency, do they have at least one row where both are true? From the rows, I don't see any. So perhaps they are inconsistent because there's no row where both are true. Wait, no, that's not the correct way to think about it.

Wait, let me get this straight. Consistency: Two statements are consistent if they can be true together. So if there exists at least one row where both are true, then they are consistent. If in all rows they are not both true, then they are inconsistent.

Looking back, in all 8 rows, do any have both propositions true? Let's check:

Row 1: F, T → No
Row 2: F, T → No
Row3: F, F → No
Row4: F, F → No
Row5: F, F → No
Row6: F, T → No
Row7: T, F → No
Row8: F, F → No

So in none of the rows are both propositions true. Therefore, they are inconsistent because there is no situation where both can be true. Wait, but earlier I thought that if two statements are not contradictory, they are consistent. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should clarify the definitions:

- Logically equivalent: same truth values in all rows.
- Contradictory: opposite truth values in all rows (i.e., whenever one is T, the other is F, and vice versa).
- Consistent: not contradictory. So if they are not contradictory, they are consistent. If they are contradictory, they are inconsistent.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Consistent means that the statements can be both true at the same time. So if there's at least one row where both are T, then they are consistent. If in all rows, they cannot be both T, then they are inconsistent.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up the terms. Let me check:

Consistency: Two propositions are consistent if they are not contradictory. That is, if there is no contradiction between them. So if they are not contradictory, they are consistent. But sometimes, people define consistent as being able to be true together, which would require at least one row where both are T.

But in our case, since in some rows, both are F (e.g., row3,4,5,8), they are not contradictory, but they are also never both T. So are they consistent or inconsistent?

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

- If two propositions are contradictory, they are always opposite. So they are inconsistent because they cannot both be true. But in our case, they are not contradictory because, for example, in row3, both are F. So they are not contradictory.

- Then, are they consistent? Consistency requires that they can be true together, which would mean there's at least one row where both are T. Since in our case, there is no such row, they are inconsistent because they cannot be both true. So they are inconsistent, but not contradictory.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting definitions. Let me double-check.

In logic, two statements A and B are:

- Consistent: If A and B can both be true in at least one situation. So if there's a row where both are T, they're consistent.
- Inconsistent: If they cannot both be true in any situation. So if in all rows, either A is T and B is F, or vice versa, or both are F. But if they can never both be T, they are inconsistent.

Wait, but in our case, they can both be F, but they can never both be T. So they are inconsistent because they cannot be both true. But they are also not contradictory because they are not always opposite; they can both be F.

So the answer would be that they are inconsistent.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see:

Options:

A: Logically equivalent and inconsistent → No, they're not equivalent.

B: Neither equivalent nor contradictory, but consistent → No, because they are inconsistent.

C: Logically equivalent → No.

D: Inconsistent → Yes, because they cannot both be true.

E: Contradictory → No.

F: Both contradictory and inconsistent → No, they're not contradictory.

G: Neither contradictory nor consistent, but equivalent → No.

H: Both equivalent and contradictory → No.

I: Contradictory and consistent → No.

So the correct answer is D: Inconsistent.

Wait, but earlier I thought that in some rows, both are F, so they are not contradictory, but they are inconsistent because they can't be both T. So the answer should be D: Inconsistent.
</think>

The two propositions are not logically equivalent because their truth values differ in some rows. They are not contradictory because they are not always opposite. However, they are inconsistent because there is no row where both propositions are true simultaneously.

Answer: D
