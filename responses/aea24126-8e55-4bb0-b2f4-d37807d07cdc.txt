Okay, so I've got this question about local government financial reporting, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking which of the options is considered part of the required supplementary information for general purpose external financial reporting.

First, I remember that local governments produce financial reports that are meant for external stakeholders, like the public and investors. These reports usually include several key components. I think the main ones are the financial statements and some supplementary information that goes along with them.

Looking at the options, let's go through each one:

A: Statement of cash flows. I know that's part of the financial statements. The main statements usually include the statement of financial position, statement of revenues and expenditures, and the statement of cash flows. So A is part of the financial statements, not supplementary.

B: Internal control over financial reporting. That sounds more like an internal management tool. I think it's important, but I'm not sure if it's part of the required supplementary information. Maybe it's included in the notes or something else?

C: Financial statement audit report. I'm pretty sure that's part of the supplementary information. Audits provide an independent assessment, so the audit report would be included as supplementary to the financial statements.

D: Government-wide financial statement. That's another main financial statement. It's part of the comprehensive report, not supplementary.

E: Comprehensive annual financial report. This is the big report that includes all the financial statements and supplementary info. But the question is asking for what's part of the supplementary info, not the whole report itself. So E might not be the answer.

F: Combining nonmajor fund statement. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think combining statements are for when a government has component units, and nonmajor funds are part of that. It's a financial statement, so probably not supplementary.

G: Fund financial statement. This is another main financial statement, focusing on specific funds. So G is part of the financial statements, not supplementary.

H: Management discussion and analysis. I think this is a section where management explains the financial results, discusses the government's performance, and maybe future plans. This is definitely supplementary information because it's not part of the core financial statements but adds context.

I: Notes to the financial statements. These are essential. They provide detailed information about the accounting policies, transactions, and other matters. Notes are part of the financial statements, so they're not supplementary; they're integral.

Wait, but the question is about supplementary information. So, the main financial statements are D, G, A, etc. Supplementary information would include things like the audit report, management discussion, and maybe some schedules or notes. But wait, the notes are part of the financial statements, so they're not supplementary.

So, the options that are supplementary would be C (audit report) and H (management discussion). The question is asking which is considered part of the required supplementary information. I think the audit report is definitely required and is supplementary. Management discussion is also required, but is it considered supplementary?

I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The comprehensive annual financial report (E) includes the financial statements and supplementary information. The supplementary info typically includes the management discussion and analysis (H), the audit report (C), and maybe some statistical data or other sections.

So the question is which of the options is part of the required supplementary info. Both C and H seem possible. But the options are A to I, and I can only choose one.

Wait, the question says "which of the following is considered part of the required supplementary information." So it's singular. So I need to pick one.

I think the audit report is definitely required. Management discussion is also required, but maybe in some contexts, it's not as formal as the audit report. Or perhaps the audit report is more directly part of the supplementary info.

Alternatively, I might be mixing up the components. The notes to the financial statements are part of the financial statements, so they're not supplementary. The audit report is supplementary because it's an external opinion on the financial statements.

So the answer is C: Financial statement audit report.

Wait, but some sources say that the management discussion and analysis is part of the supplementary information. So perhaps H is also correct. But I'm not sure if the question includes multiple correct answers, but since it's a multiple-choice with one answer, I think C is the correct choice because the audit report is a standard supplementary document.

Alternatively, I might be wrong. Let me check another angle. The government-wide statements (D) and fund financial statements (G) are the main financial statements. The statement of cash flows (A) is part of them. The comprehensive annual financial report (E) is the container that includes everything.

The required supplementary information would include things like the audit report, management discussion, and maybe the combining statements if applicable. But the combining nonmajor fund statement (F) is a financial statement, so it's not supplementary.

So the options that are supplementary are C, H, and maybe F if it's a combining statement, but I think F is a financial statement.

Therefore, between C and H, I think both are correct, but the question is asking for one. Since the audit report is definitely required, I'll go with C.

The question asks which option is part of the required supplementary information for general purpose external financial reporting of a local government. Supplementary information typically includes materials that provide context, assurance, or additional details to the main financial statements. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A, D, G, and E** are part of the main financial statements or the comprehensive report, not supplementary.
- **B, F, and I** are either internal tools, financial statements, or part of the notes, not supplementary.
- **C (Financial statement audit report)** is an external audit report, which is a required supplementary document providing assurance on the financial statements.
- **H (Management discussion and analysis)** is also supplementary, as it provides insights and context but is not the main financial statement.

While both **C** and **H** are supplementary, the audit report is a definitive required component, making **C** the best answer.

Answer: C
