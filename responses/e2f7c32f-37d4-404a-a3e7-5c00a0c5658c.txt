Question:

Consider the following assumptions about electronic storage for the text in all the books of a university's libraries. - The libraries at the university collectively contain 3 million books. - A book contains an average of 400 pages. - A page contains an average of 50 lines. - A line on a page contains an average of 10 words. - A word contains an average of 5 letters/characters. - A letter/character is represented by 1 byte. Based on the given assumptions, which of the following is the unit in which the electronic storage required for the text in all the books of the university's libraries would best be measured?

Options:

A: Kilobyte (2^10 or approximately 10^3 bytes)
B: Petabyte ( 2^50 or approximately 10^15 bytes)
C: Yottabyte (2^80 or approximately 10^24 bytes)
D: Exabyte (2^60 or approximately 10^18 bytes)
E: Byte (1 byte)
F: Bit (1/8 of a byte)
G: Zettabyte (2^70 or approximately 10^21 bytes)
H: Terabyte ( 2^40 or approximately 10^12 bytes)
I: Gigabyte ( 2^30 or approximately 10^9 bytes)
J: Megabyte ( 2^20 or approximately 10^6 bytes)

Okay, so I've got this question about electronic storage for all the books in a university's libraries. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the problem states that there are 3 million books. Each book has an average of 400 pages. So, the first thing I should probably do is find out the total number of pages across all books. To do that, I'll multiply the number of books by the number of pages per book. So that's 3,000,000 books * 400 pages/book. Let me calculate that: 3,000,000 * 400 equals 1,200,000,000 pages. Wait, that's 1.2 billion pages. That's a lot!

Next, each page has an average of 50 lines. So I need to find the total number of lines. I'll take the total pages and multiply by lines per page. So 1,200,000,000 pages * 50 lines/page. Let me do that math: 1.2e9 * 50 = 60,000,000,000 lines. That's 60 billion lines.

Now, each line has an average of 10 words. So the total number of words would be the total lines multiplied by 10 words per line. So 60,000,000,000 lines * 10 words/line equals 600,000,000,000 words. That's 600 billion words.

Each word has an average of 5 letters/characters. So I need to find the total number of characters. Multiply the total words by 5: 600,000,000,000 words * 5 letters/word equals 3,000,000,000,000 letters. That's 3 trillion letters.

Each letter is represented by 1 byte. So the total storage required is the number of letters in bytes. So 3,000,000,000,000 bytes. Let me write that in scientific notation: 3e12 bytes.

Now, I need to figure out what unit this corresponds to from the options given. Let's look at the options:

A: Kilobyte (2^10 ≈ 1e3)
B: Petabyte (2^50 ≈ 1e15)
C: Yottabyte (2^80 ≈ 1e24)
D: Exabyte (2^60 ≈ 1e18)
E: Byte (1)
F: Bit (1/8)
G: Zettabyte (2^70 ≈ 1e21)
H: Terabyte (2^40 ≈ 1e12)
I: Gigabyte (2^30 ≈ 1e9)
J: Megabyte (2^20 ≈ 1e6)

So the total is 3e12 bytes. Looking at the options, H is Terabyte which is about 1e12. So 3e12 would be 3 terabytes. But wait, let me double-check the exponents.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recount:

3,000,000 books * 400 pages/book = 1.2e9 pages.

1.2e9 pages * 50 lines/page = 6e10 lines.

6e10 lines * 10 words/line = 6e11 words.

6e11 words *5 letters/word = 3e12 letters.

Yes, that's correct. So 3e12 bytes.

Now, 1 terabyte is approximately 1e12 bytes. So 3e12 would be 3 TB. Wait, but looking at the options, the unit is per the storage, not the exact number. The question is asking which unit is appropriate. So between the options, H is Terabyte, which is 1e12, so 3e12 is in the terabyte range. So the correct unit would be Terabytes, which is option H.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponents. Because sometimes people confuse binary and decimal prefixes. But the question says approximate, so I think it's using the decimal system where 1 TB is 1e12 bytes.

So the total is 3e12 bytes, which is 3 TB. So the unit is terabytes, so the answer is H.

The electronic storage required is calculated to be 3e12 bytes, which corresponds to terabytes. 

Answer: H
