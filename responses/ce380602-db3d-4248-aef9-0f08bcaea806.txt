Okay, so I've got this question about interferometry, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says: A 5 cm thick transparent sample is examined interferometrically using green light of 550 nm. If an accuracy of 1 part in 2 million is desired, to what fraction, in percent, of fringe width must any distortions be measured? And is this possible?

The options are from A to J, with various percentages.

Hmm, okay, so I remember that in interferometry, the basic idea is that when light reflects off two surfaces (like in a Michelson interferometer), the interference pattern gives information about the sample. The fringes are the bright and dark bands you see, and the spacing between them (fringe width) depends on the wavelength and the path difference.

The accuracy desired is 1 part in 2 million. That sounds like a very precise measurement. I think that relates to how small a change we can detect. So, if the accuracy is 1 part in 2 million, that means the measurement can detect changes down to 1/2,000,000 of the total measurement.

Wait, but what's the total measurement here? The sample is 5 cm thick. Oh wait, but in interferometry, the path difference is usually in terms of the light's wavelength. So maybe I should think in terms of the optical path length. The optical path length (OPL) is the physical thickness multiplied by the refractive index, but since the sample is transparent and assuming it's in air or similar, maybe the refractive index is about 1, so OPL is approximately 5 cm.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 5 cm is the physical thickness. But the wavelength is given as 550 nm. So the number of wavelengths in 5 cm would be 5 cm / 550 nm. Let me calculate that. Wait, 5 cm is 50,000,000 nm (since 1 cm is 10^7 nm). So 50,000,000 nm divided by 550 nm is approximately 50,000,000 / 550 ≈ 90,909. So about 90,909 wavelengths in the sample. That would mean a lot of fringes.

Wait, but the question is about the accuracy. The accuracy is 1 part in 2 million, which is 1/2,000,000. So the smallest change we can detect is 1/2,000,000 of something. I think that something is the fringe width.

Wait, the fringe width is the distance between two consecutive fringes. So if the fringe width is W, then 1/2,000,000 of W would be the smallest detectable change. But the question is asking to what fraction of the fringe width must any distortions be measured. So I think it's about the ratio of the distortion to the fringe width.

But wait, the accuracy is 1 part in 2 million, so the fraction would be 1/(2e6) times the fringe width. So the fraction would be (1/2e6) * W, which is W/(2e6). But wait, no, the question is phrased as "to what fraction, in percent, of fringe width must any distortions be measured." So that would be (distortion / W) * 100%. But the accuracy is 1 part per 2 million, so the distortion must be at least 1/2e6 times the total path length or something else?

Wait, perhaps I should approach this using the formula for fringe spacing. The fringe width W is given by W = λ / (2 * n), where n is the number of fringes per unit length. Alternatively, I think the general formula is W = λ / (2 * Δ), where Δ is the path difference per fringe. Wait, maybe I should recall that the fringe width is the distance between fringes on the screen, which depends on the wavelength, the angle, and the distance to the screen. But perhaps in this case, we can model it as W = λ * D / d, where D is the distance to the screen and d is the separation between the two mirrors or something. But maybe that's complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps the fringe width is related to the change in path length that causes a shift of one fringe. Each fringe corresponds to a change of λ/2 in the optical path length, because when the path difference changes by λ/2, the phase changes by 2π, leading to a shift from bright to dark, etc. Wait, no, each full fringe shift corresponds to λ/2 change in path difference. Because in a Michelson interferometer, when one mirror moves by a distance d, the path difference changes by 2d (since light goes to the mirror and back), so a change of λ/2 in the path difference (2d = λ/2 → d=λ/4) would shift the fringes by half a wavelength, but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, perhaps better to think in terms of the phase change. The phase change per fringe is 2π. The phase is related to the path difference: phase = (2π/λ) * (2Δ), where Δ is the path difference (since light goes and comes back). So each fringe corresponds to a Δ of λ/2. So if the path difference changes by λ/2, you get a shift of one fringe.

So the fringe width W (the spacing between fringes on the screen) depends on how much the path difference changes per unit length on the screen. But perhaps we can relate the fringe width to the wavelength and the geometry of the setup.

But maybe another approach: the number of fringes across the sample would be the total phase shift divided by 2π. The total phase shift for the 5 cm sample would be (2π/λ) * (2 * 5 cm), because the light goes through the sample twice (once going in, once coming back out). So phase shift is (2π/λ) * 2 * 5 cm.

Wait, let me compute that. 5 cm is 50,000,000 nm. So 2 * 50,000,000 nm = 10^8 nm. Wavelength λ is 550 nm. So phase shift is (2π/550) * 1e8 ≈ (2π * 1e8)/550 ≈ (2π * 181,818) ≈ ~1.14e6 radians. Since each fringe is 2π radians, the number of fringes would be total phase shift divided by 2π, which is (1.14e6) / (2π) ≈ 1.14e6 / 6.28 ≈ ~181,000 fringes. So each fringe corresponds to a phase change of 2π, which is a path difference of λ/2.

Wait, but the physical length of each fringe on the screen (fringe width) depends on the setup, but perhaps we can model it as W = λ * L / d, where L is the distance from the source to the screen, and d is the distance between the mirrors or something like that. But since the setup isn't given, maybe we don't need to calculate W. Instead, perhaps the question is about determining the smallest detectable change in the sample's thickness, given the accuracy, and expressing that as a fraction of the fringe width.

Wait, the accuracy is 1 part in 2 million, so the smallest detectable change in the sample's thickness would be (1/2,000,000) * 5 cm. Let's compute that. 5 cm divided by 2e6 is 5 / 2e6 = 2.5e-6 meters, which is 2.5 micrometers.

Wait, but how does that relate to the fringe width? Because each fringe corresponds to a change in the optical path difference of λ/2. So a change in physical thickness Δt would cause a change in optical path difference of 2Δt (since light goes through twice), so the phase shift would be (2Δt * 2π)/λ. Or perhaps I should think in terms of fringes: each fringe corresponds to a physical change of λ/(4), because the optical path difference for one fringe is λ/2, so the physical movement is (λ/2)/2 = λ/4. Because in a Michelson setup, moving one mirror by d causes a 2d change in optical path (since light goes to the mirror and back), so to get a phase shift of λ/2 (one fringe), d must be λ/(4).

Wait, so each fringe corresponds to a physical displacement of λ/(4). For λ = 550 nm, that's 550/4 = 137.5 nm. So each fringe is 137.5 nm in physical displacement.

Wait, but the sample's thickness is 5 cm, which is 50,000,000 nm. So the number of fringes would be 50,000,000 / 137.5 ≈ 362,318 fringes. So the fringe width W on the screen would depend on the setup, but perhaps we don't need to compute it directly.

But back to the question. We need an accuracy of 1 part in 2 million. So the smallest detectable change in the sample's thickness is 5 cm / 2e6 = 2.5 micrometers, as I calculated earlier. Now, to express this as a fraction of the fringe width, which is the physical displacement corresponding to one fringe, which is 137.5 nm.

Wait, but 2.5 micrometers is 2500 nm. So 2500 nm / 137.5 nm ≈ 18.18 fringes. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait. Because the fringe width is the physical displacement per fringe. So each fringe is 137.5 nm. So if the change we can detect is 2500 nm, that's 2500 / 137.5 ≈ 18 fringes. But that seems way too large. Maybe I'm mixing up something.

Wait, no, wait. The accuracy is 1 part in 2 million of the total measurement. The total measurement is 5 cm, so the smallest change is 5 cm / 2e6 = 2.5e-6 meters, which is 2.5 micrometers. But each fringe corresponds to a physical change of λ/4, which is 137.5 nm. So the number of fringes corresponding to 2.5 micrometers is 2500 nm / 137.5 nm ≈ 18.18 fringes. So the change is 18 fringes, but that seems way too large, which doesn't make sense because the accuracy should be a small fraction of a fringe.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the accuracy. If the accuracy is 1 part in 2 million, it's 1/(2e6), so the smallest change detectable is 5 cm * (1/2e6) )= 2.5e-6 meters = 2.5 micrometers. But each fringe corresponds to a change of λ/4 = 137.5 nm. So the fraction of the fringe width that the change represents is (2.5 micrometers) / (137.5 nm) = 2500 nm / 137.5 nm ≈ 18.18. So that's 18.18 times the fringe width. But that can't be right because that would mean the change is much larger than a single fringe, which doesn't make sense. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the physical displacement with the optical path difference. Let me think again. The optical path difference per fringe is λ/2. So when the physical thickness changes by Δt, the optical path difference changes by 2Δt (since light goes through twice). So to get a phase shift of one fringe (λ/2), 2Δt = λ/2 → Δt = λ/4.

So each fringe corresponds to a physical change of λ/4, which is 137.5 nm for λ=550 nm.

Now, the accuracy is 1 part in 2e6, so the smallest change we can detect is 5 cm / 2e6 = 2.5e-6 m = 2.5 micrometers = 2500 nm.

So the number of fringes corresponding to 2500 nm is 2500 / 137.5 ≈ 18 fringes. That seems like a lot, but perhaps that's correct. But the question is asking what fraction of the fringe width must any distortions be measured. So in terms of the fringe width (W), which is 137.5 nm, the distortion is 2500 nm, so 2500/137.5 ≈ 18.18, which is 1818% of the fringe width. That doesn't make sense because the answer options are all below 10%. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the accuracy is 1 part in 2 million relative to the fringe width, not the sample's thickness. Let me read the question again.

The question says: "...accuracy of 1 part in 2 million is desired, to what fraction, in percent, of fringe width must any distortions be measured?"

Ah, so the accuracy is 1 part in 2 million, but in terms of the fringe width. So the minimum detectable change in the sample's thickness is (1/2e6) * fringe width.

Wait, no, perhaps the accuracy is 1/2e6 times the fringe width. Because the question says, "to what fraction of fringe width must any distortions be measured." So the distortions (changes) must be measured to a fraction of the fringe width. So if the accuracy is 1 part in 2 million, then the fraction would be 1/(2e6) times the fringe width. So the fraction is 1/(2e6) ≈ 0.0000005, which is 0.00005%. But that's not among the options. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe the question is asking what fraction of the fringe width corresponds to the smallest detectable change. So the smallest change in the sample's thickness is 5 cm / 2e6 = 2.5 micrometers. Now, the fringe width corresponds to a physical change of λ/4 = 137.5 nm. So the fraction is (2.5 micrometers) / (137.5 nm) = 2500 nm / 137.5 nm ≈ 18.18. So 18.18 times the fringe width. But that can't be because the options are much smaller. So perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.

Alternatively, maybe the fringe width is the distance between two fringes on the screen, which depends on the setup. But without knowing the setup, perhaps we can express the fraction in terms of the wavelength and the thickness.

Wait, another approach: The number of fringes in the sample is (2 * thickness) / (λ/2) )= (2 * 5e4 nm) / (550 nm/2) )= (1e5 nm) / 275 nm ≈ 363.6 fringes. So the fringe width is the sample thickness divided by the number of fringes, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the number of fringes is given by the total phase shift divided by 2π. The phase shift for the sample is (2π/λ) * 2 * 5 cm = (2π/550 nm) * 1e8 nm = (2π * 1e8)/550 ≈ 2π * 181,818 ≈ 1.14e6 radians. Number of fringes is total phase / 2π = 1.14e6 / 6.28 ≈ 181,000 fringes.

But how does that help? Maybe the fringe width W is the total sample length divided by the number of fringes. So W = 5 cm / 181,000 ≈ 2.76e-5 cm, which is 27.6 micrometers. So each fringe is about 27.6 micrometers wide on the screen.

Now, the accuracy is 1 part in 2e6, so the smallest detectable change is 5 cm / 2e6 = 2.5e-6 meters = 2.5 micrometers. So the fraction of the fringe width that this represents is (2.5 micrometers) / (27.6 micrometers) ≈ 0.0906, which is about 9.06%. That's close to option C: 9.5% or option E:3.5%, but 9.06% is closer to 9%, which isn't exactly an option, but option C is 9.5% and option H is 4.5%. Wait, but wait, 9% is not among the options. The closest is option C:9.5%.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the fringe width. Let's recalculate. Number of fringes is about 181,000, so W = 5 cm / 181,000 ≈ 0.0000276 cm, which is 27.6 micrometers. So 2.5 micrometers is 2.5 / 27.6 ≈ 0.0906, or 9.06% of the fringe width. So approximately 9.1%, which is closest to option C:9.5%.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the fringe width is calculated based on the wavelength and the angle, but without knowing the specifics of the setup, maybe we're supposed to relate the accuracy to the fringe width using the ratio of the wavelength to the sample thickness or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. The required accuracy is 1 part in 2e6 of the fringe width. So the fraction is 1/(2e6) = 0.5e-6, which is 0.00005%, but that's way too small and not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased as the fraction of the fringe width that the distortions must be measured to, to achieve the desired accuracy. So if the accuracy is 1 part in 2e6 relative to the fringe width, then the fraction is 1/(2e6) ≈ 0.00005%, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again: The question asks, to what fraction of the fringe width must distortions be measured to achieve an accuracy of 1 part in 2 million. So the required accuracy is (distortion) / (something) = 1/2e6. The 'something' is the fringe width, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps the accuracy is (distortion) / (fringe width) = 1/2e6. So distortion = (1/2e6) * fringe width. Therefore, the fraction is (1/2e6) * 100% ≈ 0.00005%, which is not an option. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'accuracy' refers to the relative change in the sample's thickness. So desired accuracy is (Δt)/t = 1/2e6, where t is 5 cm. So Δt = 5 cm / 2e6 = 2.5e-6 meters = 2.5 micrometers. Now, each fringe corresponds to a change of λ/4, which is 137.5 nm. So the number of fringes that Δt corresponds to is 2500 nm / 137.5 nm ≈ 18.18 fringes. So the change is 18 fringes. But the question is about the fraction of the fringe width, so 18 fringes would mean the distortion is 18 times the fringe width, but that doesn't make sense because fringes are periodic.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the physical thickness change with the number of fringes. Let me think differently. The fringe width W is the physical distance on the screen corresponding to one fringe. The number of fringes per meter is given by something like (2 * D * n) )/ λ, where D is the distance to the screen and n is the number of fringes. But without knowing D, perhaps we can't calculate W. Alternatively, perhaps the fringe spacing is given by W = λ * L / d, where L is the distance between the mirrors and d is the separation. But without knowing L and d, maybe we can't proceed that way.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the fringe width is the distance between two adjacent fringes on the screen, which can be expressed as W = λ * D / d, where D is the distance from the source to the screen, and d is the separation between the two reflecting surfaces (mirrors). But again, without knowing D or d, I can't compute W numerically. So perhaps there's another way.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the ratio between the accuracy (1/2e6) and the fringe width, but I'm not getting it right. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the phase shift. The phase shift per fringe is 2π, and the phase shift per nm is 2π/λ. So the phase shift for the sample is (2π/λ) * 2 * t, where t is the thickness. The number of fringes is (2π/λ) * 2t / (2π) )= (2t)/λ. So for t=5 cm=5e4 nm, number of fringes is (2 *5e4)/550 ≈ 181.8 fringes.

Wait, but that doesn't directly help. Maybe the fringe width is the physical thickness per fringe. So each fringe corresponds to a thickness change of λ/(2n), where n is the refractive index. If n≈1, then λ/2 per fringe. But that would be 550/2=275 nm. So each fringe is 275 nm in thickness. So the accuracy is 1/2e6 of the sample's total thickness, which is 5 cm=5e7 nm. So 5e7 /2e6=25 nm. So the smallest detectable change is 25 nm. Now, the fraction of the fringe width is 25 nm / 275 nm ≈ 0.0909, or 9.09%. So approximately 9.1%, which would be closest to option C:9.5%.

But wait, another approach: the fringe width W is the physical thickness change corresponding to one fringe. For a Michelson interferometer, moving one mirror by d causes a phase shift of (2d * 2π)/λ. One full fringe (λ/2 phase shift) requires d=λ/(4). So W=λ/4=550/4=137.5 nm per fringe.

The desired accuracy is 1 part in 2e6 of the sample's thickness. So the smallest detectable change is 5 cm / 2e6 = 2.5e-6 m = 2.5 micrometers = 2500 nm.

The number of fringes in 2500 nm is 2500 / 137.5 ≈ 18.18 fringes. But the question is about the fraction of the fringe width, which is 137.5 nm. So 2500 nm is 2500/137.5 ≈ 18.18 times the fringe width. But that's about 1818% of the fringe width, which isn't an option. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the absolute change with the relative fraction. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking what fraction of the fringe width corresponds to the accuracy level. So the accuracy is 1/2e6, so the fraction is 1/(2e6) of the fringe width. So (1/2e6) *100% = 0.00005%, which isn't an option.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to approach it from another angle. The question is about measuring distortions. The required accuracy is 1 part in 2e6. So the distortions must be measured to a precision of 1/(2e6) times something. I think it's the fringe width. So the fraction is (1/2e6) * 100% = 0.00005%, but that's not an option. So perhaps the question is phrased differently.

Wait, maybe the 'accuracy of 1 part in 2 million' refers to the number of fringes. So if the sample's thickness causes N fringes, then an accuracy of 1 part in 2 million would mean you can resolve 1/(2e6) of the fringe width. So the fraction is 1/(2e6), which is 0.00005%, not an option.

Alternatively, maybe the required precision is that the distortions must be measured to a fraction of the fringe width such that the overall accuracy is 1/(2e6). So if the fraction is f, then f * W = (1/(2e6)) * something. I'm getting more confused.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the number of fringes and then find the relative fraction. The sample is 5 cm thick, which is 5e4 mm. The wavelength is 550 nm. The number of wavelengths in 5 cm is 5e7 nm / 550 nm ≈ 90,909 wavelengths. Each wavelength corresponds to 2 fringes (since each fringe is λ/2). So number of fringes is 90,909 * 2 ≈ 181,818 fringes.

The fringe width is the sample length divided by the number of fringes, so W = 5 cm / 181,818 ≈ 2.75e-5 cm, which is 27.5 micrometers.

The desired accuracy is 1 part in 2 million of the sample's thickness, so the smallest change detectable is 5 cm / 2e6 = 2.5e-6 m = 2.5 micrometers.

Now, the fraction of the fringe width that 2.5 micrometers represents is (2.5 micrometers) / (27.5 micrometers) ≈ 0.0909, or about 9.09%. So approximately 9.1%, which is closest to option C:9.5%.

So the answer would be option C:9.5%.

But wait, let me check my calculations again. The number of fringes is (2 * t) / (λ/2) )= (2 *5e4 nm) / (550/2) )= (1e5 nm) / 275 nm ≈ 363.6 fringes per mm? Wait, no, wait. Wait, t is 5 cm, which is 50 mm. So 50 mm * 1e4 nm/mm = 5e5 nm. Wait, no, 1 mm is 1e7 nm, so 5 cm is 500 mm, which is 5e5 nm. Wait, no, wait: 1 cm = 10 mm, so 5 cm=50 mm. 1 mm=1e7 nm, so 50 mm=5e8 nm. Wait, that can't be right because 5 cm is 50,000,000 nm (since 1 cm=1e7 nm). So 5 cm is 5e7 nm. So the number of fringes is (2 *5e7 nm) / (550 nm) )= 1e8 / 550 ≈ 1.818e5 fringes. So W = 5e7 nm / 1.818e5 ≈ 275 nm per fringe. So 275 nm per fringe.

The desired accuracy is 5e7 nm / 2e6 = 25 nm. So the fraction is 25 nm / 275 nm ≈ 0.0909, or 9.09%. So about 9.1%, which is option C:9.5%.
</think>

To determine the fraction of fringe width to which distortions must be measured for an accuracy of 1 part in 2 million, we analyze the problem as follows:

1. **Sample Thickness and Wavelength**: The sample is 5 cm thick, equivalent to \( 5 \times 10^7 \, \text{nm} \). The wavelength of light is \( \lambda = 550 \, \text{nm} \).

2. **Fringe Spacing**: Each fringe corresponds to a change in optical path difference of \( \lambda/2 \). For a physical thickness change \( \Delta t \), the optical path difference changes by \( 2\Delta t \). Thus, one fringe corresponds to a physical thickness change of \( \Delta t = \lambda/4 = 550/4 = 137.5 \, \text{nm} \).

3. **Desired Accuracy**: The accuracy is \( 1 \, \text{part in} \, 2 \, \text{million} \), meaning the smallest detectable change in thickness is:
   \[
   \Delta t_{\text{min}} = \frac{5 \, \text{cm}}{2 \times 10^6} = 2.5 \, \mu\text{m} = 2500 \, \text{nm}.
   \]

4. **Fraction of Fringe Width**: The fraction of the fringe width that \( \Delta t_{\text{min}} \) represents is:
   \[
   \text{Fraction} = \frac{\Delta t_{\text{min}}}{\text{Fringe Width}} = \frac{2500 \, \text{nm}}{137.5 \, \text{nm}} \approx 18.18.
   \]
   This result is inconsistent with the answer options, suggesting a misinterpretation of the fringe width.

5. **Alternative Approach**: Considering the fringe width as the physical thickness corresponding to one fringe, we calculate the number of fringes in the 5 cm sample:
   \[
   \text{Number of Fringes} = \frac{2 \times 5 \, \text{cm}}{\lambda/2} = \frac{2 \times 5 \times 10^7 \, \text{nm}}{550/2} \approx 181,818 \, \text{fringes}.
   \]
   The fringe width is then:
   \[
   W = \frac{5 \, \text{cm}}{181,818} \approx 27.5 \, \mu\text{m}.
   \]

6. **Final Fraction**: The fraction of the fringe width that \( \Delta t_{\text{min}} \) represents is:
   \[
   \text{Fraction} = \frac{\Delta t_{\text{min}}}{W} = \frac{2.5 \, \mu\text{m}}{27.5 \, \mu\text{m}} \approx 0.0909 \, \text{or} \, 9.09\%.
   \]

This is closest to **9.5%**, corresponding to option **C**.

Answer: C
