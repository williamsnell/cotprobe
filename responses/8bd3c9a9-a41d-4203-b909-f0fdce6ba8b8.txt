Okay, so I have this question about strong electrolytes. Hmm, I remember that electrolytes are substances that dissociate into ions when dissolved in water, right? And a strong electrolyte would be something that completely dissociates, meaning it breaks down entirely into ions, not just partially.

The question gives me a list of options from A to I, and I need to pick which one is a strong electrolyte. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: CH3COOH. That's acetic acid. I think acetic acid is a weak acid. I remember that strong acids like HCl, HBr, HNO3, H2SO4, HClO4 are strong electrolytes because they fully dissociate. Acetic acid doesn't fully dissociate; it only partially does. So A is a weak electrolyte, not strong.

Option B: CO2. Carbon dioxide is a gas, right? When it dissolves in water, it forms carbonic acid, H2CO3, but that's a weak acid. So CO2 itself doesn't dissociate into ions, it just forms a weak acid which isn't fully ionized. So B isn't a strong electrolyte.

Option C: O2. Oxygen gas. I don't think O2 dissolves much in water, and even if it did, it's a molecule, not ions. So O2 is not an electrolyte at all, strong or weak. So C is out.

Option D: H2O. Water can dissociate into H+ and OH- ions, but that's a very small amount. The autoionization of water is minimal, so H2O is a very weak electrolyte. So D isn't the answer.

Option E: NH3. Ammonia is a weak base. It can accept a proton to form NH4+, but it doesn't dissociate on its own much in water. So it's a weak electrolyte. E is not the answer.

Option F: CH4. Methane is a gas and doesn't dissolve much in water, and even if it did, it doesn't form ions. So F isn't an electrolyte.

Option G: HC2H3O2. Wait, that's another way to write acetic acid (CH3COOH), right? So same as option A. That's a weak acid, so it's a weak electrolyte. So G is not the answer.

Option H: HBr. Hydrobromic acid. I know HBr is a strong acid. Strong acids like HBr completely dissociate in water into H+ and Br- ions. So HBr is a strong electrolyte. That makes H a good candidate.

Option I: C6H12O6. That's glucose. Glucose is a sugar and doesn't ionize in water. It dissolves as a molecule, so it's a nonelectrolyte. So I is out.

So putting it all together, the only strong electrolyte in the list is HBr, option H.

The correct answer is H: HBr, as it is a strong acid that fully dissociates into ions in water.
