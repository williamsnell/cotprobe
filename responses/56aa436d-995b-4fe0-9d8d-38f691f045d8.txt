Okay, so I have this question about finding the mode of a list of numbers. The numbers given are 22, 25, 14, 11, 23, 27, 46. Hmm, I remember that the mode is the number that appears most frequently in a data set. But wait, let me make sure I'm thinking correctly.

First, let me list out the numbers again to check: 22, 25, 14, 11, 23, 27, 46. I notice that each of these numbers appears only once. So, each number occurs the same number of timesâ€”just one time each.

Wait, so if all numbers appear once, then there isn't any number that stands out as appearing more than the others. That means there is no mode, right? Because the mode requires at least one number to appear more frequently than the others.

Let me think again. Sometimes, people get confused between mean, median, and mode. The mean is the average, the median is the middle value when sorted, and the mode is the most frequent. Since all numbers here are unique, the mode doesn't exist for this data set.

Looking at the options, option B is "No mode." That must be the correct answer because none of the numbers repeat. The other options are all specific numbers, but since none are repeated, they can't be the mode.

I think that's it. So the answer should be B.

The mode is the number that appears most frequently. In this case, all numbers appear once, so there is no mode.

Answer: B
