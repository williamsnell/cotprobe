Okay, so I've got this Python question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is asking about the last character of the list ['a', 'Chemistry', 0, 1] when we index it with [-3]. Hmm, I remember that in Python, negative indices mean counting from the end, right? So like, -1 is the last element, -2 is the second last, and so on.

Wait, let me make sure I'm thinking about this correctly. The list given is ['a', 'Chemistry', 0, 1]. Let me count the elements. The first element is 'a' at index 0, then 'Chemistry' at index 1, 0 at 2, and 1 at 3. So the list has four elements in total.

Now, the index in question is -3. Negative indices start from the end, so -1 is the last element, which is 1. Then -2 would be 0, and -3 would be 'Chemistry'. Because counting from the end: 1 is -1, 0 is -2, 'Chemistry' is -3, and 'a' is -4.

So if I index the list at [-3], I should get 'Chemistry'. Looking at the options, option A is 'Chemistry', which matches what I'm thinking.

Wait, but let me double-check. Sometimes I get confused with the negative indices. So the order from the end is: 1 is -1, 0 is -2, 'Chemistry' is -3, and 'a' is -4. So yes, -3 is 'Chemistry'. So the correct answer should be A.

The list has four elements. Negative index -3 refers to the third element from the end, which is 'Chemistry'.
