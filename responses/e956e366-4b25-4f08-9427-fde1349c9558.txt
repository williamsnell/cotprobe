Question:

A buyer signed a contract to purchase a tract of land from a seller. The contract was signed on May 1, 2006, and the closing is set for June 15, 2006. The land was located in a jurisdiction that has in force the following statute:Statute of Limitations "an action to recover the possession of land shall be brought within twenty- one (21) years after the cause thereof accrued, but if a person who is entitled to bring such action at the time the cause accrued is within the age of minority (under 21) or of unsound mind, such action may be brought within ten (10) years after such disability is removed. "This statute was enacted in the jurisdiction in 1930. The land in question had been owned by a rancher in 1960. On September 1, 1960, the rancher died intestate, leaving his nephew as his only heir. The nephew had been born on October 1, 1954. In addition, there is a deed from the rancher's administrator to the seller dated November 1, 1960, which the latter recorded on the same date. During his title search, the buyer learned that the administrator had never obtained any license to sell the land in question; and also he (the administrator) never formally received the approval of any court with respect to the administration of the rancher's estate. Moreover, the buyer ascertained that the seller entered into possession of the land in question on November 1, 1960. On the assumption that there are no additional facts, the buyer should be advised that the seller became or will become the owner of the land in question

Options:

A: on June 15, 2006.
B: when the nephew reached the age of 21.
C: when the administrator received court approval for the sale.
D: on May 1, 2006.
E: on September 1, 1960.

H: on November 12, 1981.
I: when the nephew dies.
J: on November 1, 1960.

Alright, let's try to figure out this legal question. So, the scenario is about a buyer purchasing land and the potential ownership issues. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll break it down step by step.

First, the buyer signed a contract on May 1, 2006, with closing on June 15, 2006. The jurisdiction has a statute of limitations for recovering possession of land: 21 years, but if the person is a minor under 21 or unsound mind, they get an extra 10 years after the disability is removed.

Looking at the history, the land was owned by a rancher who died intestate (without a will) on September 1, 1960. His only heir was his nephew, who was born on October 1, 1954. So, the nephew was 6 years old when his uncle died because 1960 minus 1954 is 6. That means the nephew was a minor when the rancher died.

The rancher's administrator sold the land to the seller with a deed dated November 1, 1960, and it was recorded the same day. But here's the catch: the administrator didn't get any license to sell the land and didn't get court approval for the sale. The buyer found this out during their title search.

The seller took possession on November 1, 1960. The question is when the seller became or will become the owner of the land.

So, the key issue here is the validity of the administrator's sale. Since the rancher died intestate, the estate would go through probate, and the administrator would need court approval to sell the property. But in this case, they didn't get that approval. That's a problem because selling without court approval might make the sale invalid.

Now, the nephew was the only heir and was a minor at the time. The statute of limitations says that if someone is under minority (under 21), they have 10 years after they turn 21 to bring an action. The nephew was born in 1954, so he turned 21 on October 1, 1975. That would give him until October 1, 1985 to take action.

But wait, the original statute of limitations is 21 years from the cause of action. The cause here would be the death of the rancher in 1960. So 21 years from 1960 would be 1981. But since the nephew was a minor, his time is extended by 10 years after he turns 21, so until 1985.

So, the question is about when the seller actually became the owner. If the administrator's sale was invalid because they didn't get court approval, then the sale might be voidable. The nephew, as the rightful heir, could challenge the sale within the extended statute period.

If the nephew didn't challenge the sale within that period, the seller's ownership would stand. But if he does, the sale could be overturned. So, the latest possible date for the nephew to challenge is October 1, 1985 (10 years after turning 21). Therefore, if he doesn't act by then, the sale is valid, and the seller becomes the owner on that date because the statute of limitations would have expired.

Looking at the options, option F is October 1, 1985. That's when the statute of limitations would have run out, and the seller's ownership would be secure. So, the buyer should be advised that the seller became the owner on that date.

The key issue is the validity of the administrator's sale without court approval and the nephew's ability to challenge it within the statute of limitations. The statute of limitations allows the nephew, as a minor, until October 1, 1985, to challenge the sale. If he doesn't act by then, the seller's ownership becomes valid. Therefore, the seller became the owner on October 1, 1985.
