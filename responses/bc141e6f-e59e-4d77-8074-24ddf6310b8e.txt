Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again. It says: Calculate the work needed for a 65 kg person to climb through 4.0 meters on the surface of the Earth. The options are given as A to J with various values in joules.

Hmm, right. So, work done against gravity when climbing. I remember that when someone climbs, they're doing work against the gravitational force. The formula for gravitational potential energy is mgh, right? Because work done is equal to the change in potential energy here.

So, the person's mass is 65 kg, and they're moving up 4 meters. The acceleration due to gravity on Earth is approximately 9.8 m/s². So, plugging the numbers in: work W = m * g * h.

Let me calculate that. 65 kg multiplied by 9.8 m/s² gives me... let's see, 65 * 9.8. Hmm, 60*9.8 is 588, and 5*9.8 is 49, so together that's 588 +49 = 637 N. So the force is 637 newtons. Now, they move up 4 meters, so work is force times distance. 637 N * 4 m equals 2548 joules.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 2548 directly. Let me check the options again. Oh, option D is 2.4 x10^3 J, which is 2400 J. Option F is 2.8 x10^3, which is 2800 J. Option H is 3.2 x10^3, 3200 J. Wait, my calculation was 2548, which is approximately 2.5 x10^3. But none of the options exactly match that. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate. 65 kg times 9.8 is indeed 637 N. 637 times 4 is 2548 J. Oh, but looking at the choices, perhaps I should consider significant figures. The given values are 65 kg and 4.0 m. So, 65 has two significant figures, and 4.0 has two as well. So the result should be two sig figs. So 2548 rounds to 2.5 x10^3 J, which is 2500 J. But looking at the options, the closest higher one is D:2.4 x10^3 and F:2.8x10^3. Wait, 2500 is between 2400 and 2800. But maybe the problem expects us to use 10 m/s² for gravity? Let me try that. 65 *10 =650, times 4 is 2600 J. Hmm, that's 2.6e3, which is option G. Wait, option G is 2.6 x10^3 J. But why would they use 10 instead of 9.8? The question says to assume all gases are perfect, but nothing about gravity. Oh, maybe because it's an approximate calculation, they use 10 for simplicity.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the question is about work done against gravity. Since the person is moving upward against gravity, the work done by the person is mgh. So 65 * 9.8 *4 = 2548 J. But none of the options exactly match that. Let me see the options again.

Wait, the options are A:1.5e3, B:3.5e3, C:1.8e3, D:2.4e3, E:3.8e3, F:2.8e3, G:2.6e3, H:3.2e3, I:1.2e3, J:2.0e3.

Hmm, 2548 is closest to 2.5e3, but that's not an option. The options have D as 2.4e3, G as 2.6e3. So perhaps the intended answer is 2.5e3, but since that's not present, maybe they used 10 m/s² for gravity, making it 65 *10 *4=2600, which is 2.6e3, option G. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using 9.81 m/s². Let me calculate with 9.81: 65 *9.81=637.65, times 4 is 2550.6 J, which is 2551, still around 2.55e3, which is between D and G. But perhaps the intended answer is D:2.4e3 if they used 9.8 and rounded down.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check. 65 kg *9.8 m/s² = 637 N. 637 N *4 m=2548 J. So 2548 is approximately 2.5e3, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but among the options, the closest is D:2.4e3 or G:2.6e3.

Wait, but another thought: maybe the problem is considering the work done by the person, not just the gravitational potential energy. But in this scenario, the work done by the person is equal to the gravitational potential energy gained, assuming no other forces like friction or air resistance. So, the calculation should be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I read the question wrong. It says "climb through 4.0 m on the surface of the Earth." Wait, on the surface, so the gravitational acceleration at the surface is still about 9.8 m/s². So the calculation remains the same.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in metric tons or something else? No, the units are kg and meters, so everything's fine.

Wait, maybe I should consider the person's weight as force. Weight is mg, so 65 kg *9.8=637 N. Then work is force times displacement in the direction of the force. Since they're moving upward against gravity, the displacement is 4 m. So 637 *4=2548 J.

So given that, the closest option is G:2.6e3, which is 2600 J. Alternatively, the problem might have intended to use 10 m/s², making it 2600 J, which would be option G.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be 2.5e3, but since that's not an option, perhaps I should look again.

Wait, looking at the options again: Option D is 2.4e3 (2400), G is 2.6e3 (2600). My calculation is 2548, which is closer to 2500, but since that's not an option, I have to choose the closest one. 2548 is 48 more than 2500, which is between D (2400, 148 less) and G (2600, 52 more). So 2548 is closer to 2600 than to 2400.

Wait, but wait, 2548-2400=148, and 2600-2548=52. So yes, 2548 is closer to 2600. So the answer should be option G:2.6e3 J.

But wait, none of the options are exactly 2548, but perhaps the intended answer is D:2.4e3, considering perhaps a miscalculation elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in units.

Wait, the problem says "climb through 4.0 m". So displacement is 4 m upwards. So the work done is mgh, which is correct.

Another thought: perhaps the person's weight is 65 kg, which is correct. So, perhaps the intended answer is D:2.4e3, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects using 10 m/s², making it 2600 J, which is option G.

Wait, perhaps the options have a typo, but I think the intended answer is G:2.6e3 J.

To calculate the work needed for a 65 kg person to climb 4.0 m, we use the formula for gravitational potential energy: \( W = mgh \), where \( m = 65 \, \mathrm{kg} \), \( g = 9.8 \, \mathrm{m/s^2} \), and \( h = 4.0 \, \mathrm{m} \). 

First, calculate the force due to gravity:  
\[
F = m \cdot g = 65 \cdot 9.8 = 637 \, \mathrm{N}.
\]

Next, calculate the work done:  
\[
W = F \cdot h = 637 \cdot 4.0 = 2548 \, \mathrm{J}.
\]

Rounding to two significant figures (since the given values have two significant figures), \( 2548 \, \mathrm{J} \) becomes \( 2.5 \times 10^3 \, \mathrm{J} \). However, this exact value is not listed among the options. 

Considering the closest options, \( 2548 \, \mathrm{J} \) is closer to \( 2.6 \times 10^3 \, \mathrm{J} \) (option G) than to \( 2.4 \times 10^3 \, \mathrm{J} \) (option D). Therefore, the best match is option G.
