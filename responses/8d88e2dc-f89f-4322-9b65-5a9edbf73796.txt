Alright, so I've got this problem about alternators, and I'm a bit rusty on my electrical engineering, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see... The question has two parts, (a) and (b), and I need to solve both to find the correct option from A to J.

Starting with part (a): A 60-cycle alternator has 2 poles. What is the speed of the alternator?

Hmm, I remember that the frequency of an alternator is related to its speed and the number of poles. The formula that connects these is f = (p * N) / 120, where f is the frequency in Hz, p is the number of poles, and N is the speed in revolutions per minute (rpm). Wait, no, waitâ€”actually, I think the formula is f = (p * N) / 120, right? Because each revolution produces p/2 cycles if it's a two-phase alternator, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as f = (N * p) / 120. Yeah, that sounds familiar.

So, rearranging the formula to solve for N, the speed, we get N = (f * 120) / p. 

Given that f is 60 cycles per second, which is 60 Hz, and p is 2 poles. Plugging in the numbers: N = (60 * 120) / 2. Let me calculate that. 60 times 120 is 7200, divided by 2 is 3600. So the speed should be 3600 rpm.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check. Option F says (a) 3600 rpm. That seems right so far. But let me make sure I didn't mix up the formula. Another way to think about it: each pole contributes to the magnetic field, and the number of cycles per revolution is equal to the number of poles. So for each revolution, the alternator completes p/2 cycles if it's a two-pole machine, or p cycles for more poles. Wait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me double-check the formula.

Wait, actually, the formula I think is correct is f = (N * p) / 120. So N = (f * 120) / p. So 60 * 120 = 7200, divided by 2 is 3600. So part (a) is 3600 rpm.

Now moving to part (b): A 60-cycle alternator has a speed of 120 rpm. How many poles does it have?

Again using the same formula: f = (N * p) / 120. Rearranging for p: p = (f * 120) / N. Plugging in f=60 and N=120 rpm. So p = (60 * 120) / 120. The 120 in numerator and denominator cancel out, so p=60. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 60 * 120 is 7200, divided by 120 is 60. So p=60 poles? But looking at the options, none of them have 60 poles for part (b). Wait, let me check the options again.

Looking back: Option F says (a) 3600 rpm, (b) 60 poles. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake because 60 poles seems extremely high for an alternator. Maybe I messed up the formula. Let me re-examine.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f = (N * p) / 120. So f is in Hz, N in rpm. So for part (b), N=120 rpm, f=60 Hz. So p = (60 * 120) / 120 = 60. That's correct according to the formula, but in reality, alternators with 60 poles are very large and not common. Maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the alternator is a 60-cycle, which is 60 Hz, and N is 120 rpm. So p would be (60 * 120) / 120 = 60. So the answer for part (b) is 60 poles. But looking at the options, option F says (b) 60 poles. So that would match part (a) as 3600 rpm and part (b) as 60 poles.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check each one. Option F is (a) 3600 rpm and (b) 60 poles. So that's the one that matches both parts. But wait, I'm a bit confused because 60 poles seems high. Let me think again. Maybe the formula is f = (N * p) / 120, yes, that's correct. So if N is 120 rpm, f=60, then p= (60 * 120)/120 =60. So yes, part (b) is 60 poles. So the correct option would be F: (a) 3600 rpm, (b) 60 poles.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option F is (a) 3600 rpm and (b) 60 poles. So that's the one that fits both parts of the question.

Wait, but earlier I thought part (a) was 3600 rpm, which matches option F. But I'm a bit unsure because 60 poles seems like a lot. Maybe I should check another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f = (N * p) / 120, so for part (b), N=120rpm, f=60Hz, so p= (60 *120)/120 =60. So yes, 60 poles. So the answer is F.

The correct answer is F: (a) 3600 rpm (b) 60 poles.
