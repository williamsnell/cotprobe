Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the Haber process, right? The reaction is 3H₂(g) + N₂(g) ⇌ 2NH₃(g). The problem states that a mixture of hydrogen and nitrogen is passed over a catalyst at 400°C, and the mole ratio is 3:1 for H₂ to N₂. I need to find the total pressure when the mole fraction of ammonia in the equilibrium mixture is 10%, given that K_p is 0.00164 atm⁻².

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I should probably figure out the initial moles and how they change at equilibrium. Since the mole ratio is 3:1, let's assume we start with 3 moles of H₂ and 1 mole of N₂. So initial moles are: H₂ = 3, N₂ = 1, and NH₃ = 0.

Let me set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium). Let's let the change be -x for N₂ and H₂ because they're reacting, and +2x for NH₃. Wait, but wait, the stoichiometry is 3 H₂ and 1 N₂ producing 2 NH₃. So actually, the change would be: for every 3 moles of H₂ consumed, 1 mole of N₂ is consumed, producing 2 moles of NH₃. So maybe I should let the change be based on a variable 'x' where 3x moles of H₂ are consumed, x moles of N₂ are consumed, and 2x moles of NH₃ are produced.

Wait, that makes sense. So initial moles: H₂=3, N₂=1, NH₃=0.

Change:
H₂: -3x
N₂: -x
NH₃: +2x

So at equilibrium, moles are:
H₂: 3 - 3x
N₂: 1 - x
NH₃: 2x

Now, the mole fraction of NH₃ is given as 10%, which is 0.1. Mole fraction is moles of NH₃ divided by total moles. So:

Mole fraction of NH₃ = (2x) / ( (3-3x) + (1-x) + 2x ) = 0.1

Let me compute the denominator: 3 -3x +1 -x +2x = 4 -2x. So,

2x / (4 - 2x) = 0.1

Multiply both sides by (4-2x):

2x = 0.1*(4 - 2x)
2x = 0.4 - 0.2x

Bring 0.2x to the left:

2x + 0.2x = 0.4
2.2x = 0.4
x = 0.4 / 2.2 ≈ 0.1818 moles.

Wait, that's x ≈ 0.1818. Now, let me check if this x makes sense. For N₂, initial moles are 1, and we're subtracting x. So 1 - x ≈ 0.8182, which is positive, so that's okay. For H₂, 3 -3x ≈ 3 - 0.5454 ≈ 2.4546, also positive. So x is acceptable.

Now, the equilibrium concentrations in terms of moles are:

H₂: 3 - 3x ≈ 3 - 0.5454 ≈ 2.4546 moles
N₂: 1 - x ≈ 0.8182 moles
NH₃: 2x ≈ 0.3636 moles

But wait, I think I need to express the partial pressures, but since we're dealing with K_p, which is in terms of partial pressures, I can approach this using mole fractions and total pressure. Alternatively, perhaps using the mole fractions directly as the partial pressures relative to the total pressure.

Wait, another approach is to let the total pressure be P, and then each partial pressure is (moles of gas) × P_total divided by total moles. Alternatively, since the mole fractions are known, the partial pressures can be expressed as P × mole fraction.

But perhaps a better approach is to express the partial pressures in terms of the mole fractions and the total pressure. Let me denote the total pressure as P. Then, the partial pressures are:

P_H₂ = (3 -3x) / (4 - 2x) * P
P_N₂ = (1 -x) / (4 -2x) * P
P_NH3 = 2x / (4-2x) * P

But wait, the K_p is given in terms of partial pressures. The reaction is 3H₂ + N₂ ⇌ 2NH₃. So K_p is:

K_p = (P_NH3)^2 / (P_H2^3 * P_N2)

Substituting the expressions in terms of P:

K_p = [ (2x/(4-2x)) P ]^2 / [ ( (3-3x)/(4-2x) P )^3 * ( (1-x)/(4-2x) P ) ) ]

Hmm, that seems a bit complex. Let me simplify this expression.

First, let's note that (2x/(4-2x)) = 0.1 from the mole fraction, since the mole fraction of NH3 is 0.1. Wait, no, earlier I used 2x / (4-2x) = 0.1 to find x. So 2x/(4-2x) = 0.1, which gives x ≈ 0.1818 as before.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the total pressure P. So perhaps I can express everything in terms of P and find P.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the reaction quotient in terms of mole fractions. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: since we have the mole fractions, perhaps the expression for K_p can be written in terms of the mole fractions. Let me denote the total pressure as P. Then, the partial pressures are:

P_H2 = (3-3x)/(4-2x) * P
P_N2 = (1-x)/(4-2x) * P
P_NH3 = 2x/(4-2x) * P

Substituting into K_p:

K_p = [ (2x/(4-2x) P )^2 ] / [ ( (3-3x)/(4-2x) P )^3 * ( (1-x)/(4-2x) P ) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (4x²)/( (4-2x)^2 ) * P²

Denominator: [ (3-3x)^3 * (1-x) ) / (4-2x)^3 ) ] * P^4

So K_p = [4x² P² / (4-2x)^2 ] / [ (3-3x)^3 (1-x) P^4 / (4-2x)^3 ) ]

Simplify the fractions:

= [4x² P² (4-2x)^3] / [ (4-2x)^2 (3-3x)^3 (1-x) P^4 ) ]

= [4x² (4-2x) ] / [ (3-3x)^3 (1-x) ) ] * (1/P^2)

So,

K_p = [4x² (4-2x) ] / [ (3-3x)^3 (1-x) ) ] * (1/P²)

We can rearrange this to solve for P²:

P² = [4x² (4-2x) ] / [ (3-3x)^3 (1-x) ) ] * (1/K_p )

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me substitute the value of x we found earlier, which is x ≈ 0.1818.

Wait, perhaps it's better to find P in terms of the mole fractions and K_p.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can consider that since the mole fraction of NH3 is 10%, and the total pressure is P, then the partial pressure of NH3 is 0.1 P. Similarly, the partial pressures of H2 and N2 can be expressed in terms of their mole fractions times P.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the mole fraction of NH3 is 0.1, which is 2x/(4-2x) = 0.1, giving x ≈0.1818.

So, using x ≈0.1818, let's compute the partial pressures.

Partial pressure of NH3: 0.1 P.

Partial pressure of H2: (3-3x)/(4-2x) * P.

Let me compute (3-3x) / (4-2x):

3-3x = 3(1 -x) = 3*(1-0.1818)=3*(0.8182)=2.4546

4-2x =4 -2*(0.1818)=4 -0.3636=3.6364

So (3-3x)/(4-2x)=2.4546/3.6364 ≈ 0.675.

So P_H2 ≈0.675 P.

Similarly, P_N2 = (1-x)/(4-2x) * P.

1-x = 1-0.1818=0.8182.

So (1-x)/(4-2x)=0.8182/3.6364≈0.225.

So P_N2≈0.225 P.

Now, K_p = (P_NH3)^2 / [ (P_H2)^3 (P_N2) ]

Substituting the partial pressures:

K_p = (0.1 P)^2 / [ (0.675 P)^3 * (0.225 P) ]

= (0.01 P²) / [ (0.675^3 * 0.225) P^4 )

= 0.01 / (0.675^3 * 0.225) * (1/P²)

Because P^2 in numerator and P^4 in denominator gives 1/P².

We know K_p is 0.00164 atm^-2, so:

0.01 / (0.675^3 * 0.225) * (1/P²) ) = 0.00164

Let me compute the denominator part: 0.675^3 * 0.225.

0.675^3 = 0.675 * 0.675 = 0.4556, then *0.675 ≈ 0.3086.

0.3086 * 0.225 ≈ 0.0695.

So,

0.01 / 0.0695 * (1/P²) ) ≈ 0.00164

Compute 0.01 / 0.0695 ≈ 0.1439.

So,

0.1439 / P² = 0.00164

Rearranging,

P² = 0.1439 / 0.00164 ≈ 87.82.

So P ≈ sqrt(87.82) ≈ 9.37 atm.

Looking at the options, option A is 9.4 atm, which seems to match.

To solve the problem, we analyze the equilibrium reaction \( 3\text{H}_2(g) + \text{N}_2(g) \rightleftharpoons 2\text{NH}_3(g) \). Initially, the mole ratio of \( \text{H}_2 \) to \( \text{N}_2 \) is 3:1, so we assume 3 moles of \( \text{H}_2 \) and 1 mole of \( \text{N}_2 \). Let \( x \) represent the extent of reaction. The ICE table gives equilibrium moles as:

- \( \text{H}_2: 3 - 3x \)
- \( \text{N}_2: 1 - x \)
- \( \text{NH}_3: 2x \)

The mole fraction of \( \text{NH}_3 \) is given as 10%, so:

\[
\frac{2x}{(3 - 3x) + (1 - x) + 2x} = 0.1
\]

Simplifying the denominator:

\[
\frac{2x}{4 - 2x} = 0.1 \implies 2x = 0.4 - 0.2x \implies 2.2x = 0.4 \implies x \approx 0.1818
\]

Using \( x \approx 0.1818 \), the equilibrium moles are:

- \( \text{H}_2: 3 - 3(0.1818) \approx 2.4546 \)
- \( \text{N}_2: 1 - 0.1818 \approx 0.8182 \)
- \( \text{NH}_3: 2(0.1818) \approx 0.3636 \)

The total moles are \( 4 - 2x \approx 3.6364 \). The partial pressures are proportional to mole fractions multiplied by total pressure \( P \):

\[
P_{\text{H}_2} = \frac{2.4546}{3.6364}P \approx 0.675P, \quad P_{\text{N}_2} = \frac{0.8182}{3.6364}P \approx 0.225P, \quad P_{\text{NH}_3} = 0.1P
\]

The equilibrium constant \( K_p \) is:

\[
K_p = \frac{(P_{\text{NH}_3})^2}{(P_{\text{H}_2})^3 (P_{\text{N}_2})}
\]

Substituting the partial pressures:

\[
K_p = \frac{(0.1P)^2}{(0.675P)^3 (0.225P)} = \frac{0.01P^2}{0.675^3 \cdot 0.225 \cdot P^4} = \frac{0.01}{0.675^3 \cdot 0.225} \cdot \frac{1}{P^2}
\]

Given \( K_p = 0.00164 \, \text{atm}^{-2} \):

\[
\frac{0.01}{0.0695} \cdot \frac{1}{P^2} = 0.00164 \implies \frac{0.1439}{P^2} = 0.00164 \implies P^2 = \frac{0.1439}{0.00164} \approx 87.82 \implies P \approx 9.37 \, \text{atm}
\]

The closest option is **A: 9.4 atm**.
