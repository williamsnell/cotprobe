Okay, so I need to figure out why fiat money is dangerous. The question is asking about the inherent danger in issuing fiat money, and I have to choose the correct option from A to J.

First, I remember that fiat money is government-issued currency that isn't backed by a physical commodity like gold or silver. Unlike commodity money, fiat money's value comes from the government's decree that it must be accepted as payment. So, its value relies on the trust in the government and the economy.

Looking at the options:

A: It's often used to meet emergencies. Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe governments issue fiat money when they need funds during emergencies, but is that the danger? I think it's more about the control and potential overissuance.

B: Its quantity is controlled by the government rather than market forces. That makes sense because fiat money isn't tied to a physical commodity, so the government can print more. If they print too much, it can cause inflation. So this seems like a key point about the danger.

C: It's backed by a physical commodity. No, that's the opposite. Fiat isn't backed by gold or silver, so this is incorrect.

D: Encourages debt through interest-free loans. I don't think that's a direct result of fiat money. Maybe government borrowing, but not sure how that's the inherent danger.

E: Used for buying military supplies during war. That might be a reason to issue more, but not the core danger of fiat money itself.

F: Can only be issued by multinational corporations. No, that's not true. Governments issue fiat money, not corporations.

G: Increases complexity in international trade. I don't think so. It's more about exchange rates and how different countries manage their currencies, but not the main danger.

H: Typically associated with high deflation. Wait, actually, fiat money can lead to inflation if overissued, not deflation. So H is incorrect.

I: Has a fixed exchange rate. No, fiat currencies usually float, unlike pegged or fixed exchange rates which might be more stable but not necessarily a danger.

So, the main issue with fiat money is that the government controls its supply, which can lead to overissuance and inflation. Without the backing of a physical commodity, the value is more vulnerable to poor monetary policies. Therefore, option B seems to be the correct answer.
</think>

The danger in fiat money arises because its supply is controlled by the government, which can lead to overissuance and inflation if not managed properly. Unlike commodity-backed currencies, fiat money's value depends on trust in the government and economy, making it vulnerable to poor monetary policies.

Answer: B
