Okay, so I have this question about Chodorow's theory on gender socialization. I'm a bit rusty on my psychology, but I'll try to think it through. 

First, I remember that Chodorow was a feminist psychologist who focused on the role of family dynamics in the development of gender roles. She talked about how children internalize their parents' genders through their early relationships. 

Wait, I think she discussed something about boys and girls having different experiences based on their attachment to parents. I recall that she believed that both boys and girls are initially closely attached to their mothers. That makes sense because, in many cultures, the mother is the primary caregiver. 

But then, what happens after that? I think she said that boys eventually break away from their mothers to identify with their fathers. Girls, on the other hand, might continue to identify with their mothers. So, the idea is that boys model themselves after their fathers, while girls model themselves after their mothers. 

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that says both boys and girls are closely attached to their mothers, but then boys break away. Let me go through the options:

Option E says both boys and girls are attached to their mothers, but then boys break away. That fits with what I remember. 

Option I says boys attached to mothers, girls to fathers. That doesn't sound right because Chodorow emphasized the mother's role for both initially. 

Option D is about girls attached to mothers but breaking away. But that doesn't mention the boys. 

Option F says boys attached to mothers, girls break away. No, because boys are the ones breaking away, not the girls. 

So, yeah, Option E seems correct. Chodorow's theory is about both genders being attached to the mother, but boys later separate to identify with the father, while girls maintain that attachment, leading to different gender roles.

The answer is E: both boys and girls being closely attached to their mothers, but then boys breaking away.

Answer: E
