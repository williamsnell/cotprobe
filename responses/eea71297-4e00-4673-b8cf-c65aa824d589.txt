Question:

The managers of Disney World are considering changing the amount charged on their Humpty Dumpty ride. Presently they charge 25 cents a mile and this results in about 6,000 passengers each day. The managers believe the number of daily passengers will rise by 400 for each 1 cent decrease in the admission charge and drop by 400 for each 1 cent increase. What is the admission charge which maximizes the daily revenue?

Options:

A: 30 cents
B: 22 cents
C: 18 cents
D: 10 cents
E: 12 cents
F: 25 cents
G: 15 cents
H: 35 cents
I: 20 cents
J: 28 cents

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about Disney World managers wanting to change the admission charge for their Humpty Dumpty ride. The current charge is 25 cents, and they get about 6,000 passengers each day. The managers think that for each 1 cent decrease in the price, 400 more people will ride, and for each 1 cent increase, 400 fewer will ride. The goal is to find the admission charge that will maximize the daily revenue.

Hmm, I remember that revenue is calculated as price multiplied by quantity sold. So, I need to model this as a function and find its maximum.

Let me start by defining the variables. Let’s say the current price is 25 cents, and the number of passengers is 6,000. If the price changes by 'x' cents, then the new price would be (25 + x) cents. But wait, actually, if x is the change in price, then the new price is 25 + x cents. But wait, if x is negative, that means a decrease, and if positive, an increase. But the problem states that for each 1 cent decrease, passengers increase by 400, and for each 1 cent increase, passengers decrease by 400. So, the number of passengers can be expressed in terms of x.

Wait, maybe I should let x be the number of 1-cent changes. So, if x is positive, the price increases by x cents, and passengers drop by 400x. If x is negative, the price decreases, and passengers increase. So, the number of passengers would be 6000 - 400x. Wait, no. Because each 1 cent increase reduces passengers by 400, so if the price goes up by x cents, passengers go down by 400x. Similarly, if the price goes down by x cents, passengers go up by 400x. So, the number of passengers as a function of x is 6000 + 400*(-x) if x is positive. Wait, maybe it's better to model it as passengers = 6000 - 400*(x), where x is the change in price. Wait no, because when x is positive, the price increases, so passengers decrease. So, yes, passengers = 6000 - 400x.

But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Let's say the new price is p cents. The current price is 25, so the change is (p - 25) cents. So, if p is less than 25, the change is negative, meaning a decrease, which would increase passengers. If p is more than 25, it's an increase, which would decrease passengers.

So, the number of passengers as a function of p would be 6000 - 400*(p - 25). Wait, because each 1 cent increase (p-25 is +1) would reduce passengers by 400. So, passengers = 6000 - 400*(p -25).

Let me check that. If p is 25, passengers are 6000. If p is 26, passengers are 6000 - 400*(1) = 5600. If p is 24, passengers are 6000 - 400*(-1) = 6000 +400=6400. That seems correct.

So, the revenue R would be price times passengers: R = p * (6000 - 400*(p -25)).

Let me simplify this equation.

First, expand the passengers: 6000 -400p +10000. Because -400*(p-25) is -400p +10,000. So, 6000 +10000 is 16000, so passengers = 16000 -400p.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me recalculate:

Wait, passengers = 6000 - 400*(p -25). So, expanding that, it's 6000 -400p + 10,000. So, 6000 +10,000 is 16,000, so 16,000 -400p. So, passengers = 16,000 -400p.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when p is 25, passengers are 6000, but according to this, 16,000 -400*25=16,000 -10,000=6,000. So that works. When p decreases by 1 cent to 24, passengers would be 16,000 -400*24 = 16,000 -9,600=6,400, which is correct. When p increases to 26, passengers are 16,000 -400*26=16,000 -10,400=5,600. That's correct. So, the model is correct.

So, R = p * (16,000 -400p). Let's write that as R = p*(16,000 -400p) = 16,000p -400p².

Now, to find the maximum revenue, we can treat this as a quadratic equation in terms of p. Since the coefficient of p² is negative (-400), the parabola opens downward, so the maximum is at the vertex.

The vertex of a quadratic ax² +bx +c is at x = -b/(2a). Wait, but here, the equation is R = -400p² +16,000p. So, a=-400, b=16,000.

So, the value of p that maximizes R is at p = -b/(2a) = -16,000/(2*(-400)) = -16,000 / (-800) = 20.

So, p=20 cents.

Wait, but let me check that calculation again.

So, a is -400, b is 16,000. So, p = -16,000/(2*(-400)) = (-16,000)/(-800) = 20.

So, the maximum revenue occurs when p=20 cents.

Looking at the options, option I is 20 cents. So, the answer should be I:20 cents.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let me plug p=20 into the revenue equation.

R = 20*(16,000 -400*20) = 20*(16,000 -8,000)=20*8,000=160,000 cents, which is $1,600.

Let me check p=25: R=25*(16,000 -400*25)=25*(16,000 -10,000)=25*6,000=150,000 cents ($1,500), which is less than $1,600. So, yes, 20 seems higher.

What about p=19? R=19*(16,000 -400*19)=19*(16,000 -7,600)=19*8,400=159,600, which is less than 160,000.

p=21: R=21*(16,000 -400*21)=21*(16,000-8,400)=21*7,600=159,600. Also less.

So, yes, p=20 gives the maximum revenue. So, the correct answer is I:20 cents.

The managers of Disney World aim to maximize daily revenue by adjusting the admission charge for the Humpty Dumpty ride. Currently, the charge is 25 cents, resulting in 6,000 passengers per day. For every 1-cent decrease, 400 more passengers are expected, and for every 1-cent increase, 400 fewer passengers are anticipated.

To model this, let \( p \) represent the new admission charge in cents. The number of passengers can be expressed as \( 6000 - 400(p - 25) \), which simplifies to \( 16,000 - 400p \). The daily revenue \( R \) is then given by:

\[
R = p \times (16,000 - 400p) = 16,000p - 400p^2
\]

This is a quadratic function in the form \( R = -400p^2 + 16,000p \), where the coefficient of \( p^2 \) is negative, indicating a downward-opening parabola. The maximum revenue occurs at the vertex of the parabola, calculated as:

\[
p = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{16,000}{2(-400)} = \frac{16,000}{800} = 20
\]

Thus, the admission charge that maximizes daily revenue is 20 cents. Testing this value confirms that it yields the highest revenue compared to nearby prices.
