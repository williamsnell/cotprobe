Okay, so I've got this question about buying a sewing machine, and I need to figure out which option is the best deal and how much I'll save. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question presents two main options: a machine selling for $275 net price, and another listed at $320 with a 12 and a half percent discount. I need to compare these two to see which is cheaper and calculate the savings.

Wait, actually, looking again, the options go from A to J, and each option describes a different machine with various prices and discounts. So I think I might have misread the question initially. Let me clarify.

The question says: You can buy a sewing machine selling for $275 net price, or one listed at $320 less a 12.5% discount. Then it asks which is the best buy and how much you save by buying the better option.

Wait, but the options A to J are different machines with various prices and discounts. So perhaps the initial part of the question is just introducing the problem, and the options are the possible choices.

Wait, let me re-read the question carefully.

The question is: You can buy a sewing machine selling for $275 net price, or one listed at $320 less a 12(1/2) % discount. Which is the best buy and how much will you save by buying it instead of the other one?

Then the options are A to J, each describing a different machine with varying prices and discounts. So perhaps the initial part is just part of the problem statement, and the options are the possible choices. Alternatively, maybe the $275 and $320 machines are among the options, and I have to calculate each one's final price to find the best deal.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by calculating the final price for each option and then compare them.

Let me list out each option and calculate the discounted price where applicable.

Option A: $275 machine. So net price is $275.

Option B: $320 machine. So net price is $320.

Option C: $320 machine with a 20% discount. So I need to calculate 20% off of $320.

Option D: Both are the same price. Not sure yet, but probably not the case.

Option E: $300 machine with a 10% discount. So 10% off $300.

Option F: $320 machine with a 5% discount. So 5% off $320.

Option G: $250 machine with a 15% discount. 15% off $250.

Option H: $280 machine. Net price is $280.

Option I: $310 machine with no discount. So $310.

Option J: $350 machine with a 15% discount. 15% off $350.

Wait, but the initial part of the question says you can buy either the $275 machine or the $320 machine with a 12.5% discount. So perhaps the options are more about which of the options (A-J) is better than the other, but I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe the question is presenting two options: one is $275, the other is $320 with 12.5% discount. Then, among the options A-J, which one is the best buy compared to these two.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it step by step.

First, calculate the price after discount for the $320 machine with 12.5% off. Then compare it to the $275 machine to see which is cheaper and the savings.

12.5% is the same as 1/8, so 12.5% of $320 is $320 * 0.125 = $40. So the discounted price is $320 - $40 = $280.

So the $320 machine with 12.5% discount costs $280.

Now, compare this to the $275 machine. So $275 vs $280.

Wait, that would mean the $275 machine is cheaper by $5. So buying the $275 machine would save $5 compared to the $320 discounted machine.

But wait, looking at the options, perhaps some options offer better deals than both. Let me check each option's final price.

Option A: $275. So that's straightforward.

Option B: $320. So that's higher than $275, so not better.

Option C: $320 with 20% discount. So 20% of 320 is 64, so 320 - 64 = $256. That's cheaper than $275.

Option D: Both same price, but from the numbers, they aren't.

Option E: $300 with 10% discount. 10% of 300 is 30, so 300-30= $270. That's cheaper than $275.

Option F: $320 with 5% discount. 5% of 320 is 16, so 320-16= $304. More than $275, so worse.

Option G: $250 with 15% discount. 15% of 250 is 37.5, so 250-37.5= $212.50. That's much cheaper.

Option H: $280. More than $275, so worse.

Option I: $310, no discount. More than $275, worse.

Option J: $350 with 15% discount. 15% of 350 is 52.5, so 350-52.5= $297.50. More than $275, so worse.

Wait, so looking at all the options, the cheapest one is option G at $212.50, then option E at $270, then option A at $275, then option C at $256, etc.

Wait, but wait: the initial question presents two options: $275 net and $320 less 12.5%. So the two options being compared are $275 and $280. So in this case, the $275 machine is cheaper by $5. But among the options, option C (320 with 20% discount) is $256, which is even cheaper than both. So perhaps the question is asking which of the options is the best buy, not just between the two initial options.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again.

The question says: "You can buy a sewing machine selling for $275 net price, or one listed at $320 less a 12(1/2) % discount. Which is the best buy and how much will you save by buying it instead of the other one?"

The options are A to J, each describing a machine. So perhaps the question is asking which option among A-J is the best buy, and how much you save compared to the other options.

Wait, but the initial part of the question is giving two options, which may not be the same as the options A-J. So perhaps the initial part is just the scenario, and the options are other possibilities. So perhaps I need to compare all the options to find the best price.

Let me calculate each option's final price.

Option A: $275.

Option B: $320.

Option C: $320 with 20% discount. 320 * 0.8 = 256.

Option D: Both same price. Probably incorrect.

Option E: $300 with 10% discount. 300 * 0.9 = 270.

Option F: $320 with 5% discount. 320 * 0.95 = 304.

Option G: $250 with 15% discount. 250 * 0.85 = 212.5.

Option H: $280.

Option I: $310.

Option J: $350 with 15% discount. 350 * 0.85 = 297.5.

So now, looking at these final prices:

A: 275

B: 320

C: 256

D: same price (probably not correct)

E: 270

F: 304

G: 212.5

H: 280

I: 310

J: 297.5

So the cheapest is G at $212.50, then C at $256, then E at $270, then A at $275, then J at $297.5, H at $280, etc.

So the best buy is option G, costing $212.50.

Now, the question is, how much will you save by buying it instead of the other one? Wait, but the other one could be either the $275 or the $320 with 12.5% discount.

Wait, perhaps the question is only comparing the two initial options, but the options A-J are more detailed. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking which option (A-J) is the best buy, and how much you save compared to the other options.

Wait, but the initial question's two options are:

Option 1: $275 net.

Option 2: $320 less 12.5% discount, which is $280.

So comparing these two, the $275 is cheaper by $5.

But looking at the options A-J, option G is cheaper than both. So perhaps the best buy is option G, and the savings would be compared to the next best option, which is option A at $275. So saving $62.50 (275 - 212.50).

Wait, but the question says "how much will you save by buying it instead of the other one." So perhaps "it" is the better option, and "the other one" is the other initial option.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to approach it again.

The initial question presents two choices: buy a machine for $275, or buy a $320 machine with 12.5% discount (which is $280). So the two options are $275 and $280.

But the options A-J are separate options, so perhaps the question is asking which of the A-J options is the best buy compared to these two.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is giving two options, and the A-J are additional options, so we have to choose the best among all.

Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the question's structure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is saying that you can choose between buying the $275 machine or the $320 machine with 12.5% discount, and then among the options A-J, which is the best buy and how much you save.

Alternatively, perhaps the options A-J are different machines, and the question is to choose between the two initial options (the $275 and the $320 with 12.5% discount) and see which is cheaper, then compare to other options.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the price of each option and find which is the cheapest.

From earlier calculations:

Option A: $275

Option B: $320

Option C: $256

Option E: $270

Option G: $212.5

So the cheapest is G at $212.5.

So the best buy is option G. Now, how much do you save by buying it instead of the other option?

Wait, but the other option could be the $275 machine. So the saving would be $275 - $212.5 = $62.5.

Alternatively, if comparing to the $320 with 12.5% discount (which is $280), then the saving is $280 - $212.5 = $67.5.

But perhaps the question is only comparing the two initial options, but in the options A-J, option G is better than both.

Wait, perhaps the initial question is just giving two options, and the options A-J are the possible answers, each being a different machine. So I need to pick between the initial two options, or perhaps the options are more detailed.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the initial problem.

The problem says: You can buy a sewing machine for $275 net, or one listed at $320 less 12.5% discount. Which is the best buy and how much you save.

So the two options are:

Option 1: $275

Option 2: $320 - 12.5% discount = $280.

Comparing these two, option 1 is cheaper by $5.

But then the options A-J are different options, perhaps including these two, and others.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A is $275.

Option B is $320.

Option C is $320 with 20% discount.

Option E is $300 with 10% discount.

So perhaps the initial problem is part of the question, and the options are all possible choices, including the two initial options.

So the best buy would be the option with the lowest final price. From earlier calculations, option G is $212.50, which is cheaper than both initial options. So the answer would be option G.

But the question also asks how much you save by buying it instead of the other one. So if the best buy is G at $212.50, the next best would be option A at $275, so saving $62.50.

Alternatively, if comparing G to the other initial option (the $320 with 12.5% discount at $280), the saving would be $280 - $212.50 = $67.50.

But perhaps the initial question is only about the two options, and the options A-J are distractors. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate each option and choose the best.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option C, which is $320 with 20% discount, which is $256, but option G is even cheaper at $212.50.

Wait, let me recheck option G: $250 with 15% discount. 15% of 250 is 37.5, so 250 - 37.5 = 212.50.

Yes, that's correct.

So the best buy is option G, costing $212.50, which is cheaper than both the $275 and the $280 options.

So the answer would be option G, and the saving compared to the next best option (option A at $275) is $62.50.

Wait, but the question in the options is multiple choice, so the answer would be G.

But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculations.

Option G: $250 with 15% off.

15% of 250: 0.15 * 250 = 37.5.

250 - 37.5 = 212.5.

Yes.

So the best buy is option G, and the saving is $275 - $212.5 = $62.50 if comparing to the $275 machine.

Alternatively, if comparing to the $280 machine, saving is $280 - $212.5 = $67.50.

But the question says "how much will you save by buying it instead of the other one." So "it" is the best buy, and "the other one" is the alternative.

In the initial question, the alternatives were the $275 and the $280 machines. But since option G is cheaper than both, the saving would be relative to whichever of the initial options is being compared.

Wait, perhaps the question is only comparing the two initial options, but the options A-J are additional options, so the correct approach is to pick the best among all options.

In that case, the best is G at $212.50, and the saving would be compared to the next best, which is option C at $256. So saving $43.50.

Wait, but that's not matching the initial options.

I think I might be overcomplicating. The initial question presents two options: $275 and $280. The options A-J are other possibilities, so the best buy is the cheapest among all options, which is G at $212.50. The saving compared to the next cheapest option, which is C at $256, would be $43.50. But the initial options don't include G, so perhaps the answer is A or B.

Wait, perhaps the options are the possible choices, and the initial question is just the setup, so the correct answer is the cheapest option among A-J, which is G.

So the answer would be G, and the saving compared to the next option is as calculated.

Wait, but the question is a bit unclear. Let me try to think again.

The question says: You can buy a sewing machine for $275 net, or one listed at $320 less 12.5% discount. Which is the best buy and how much you save by buying it instead of the other one?

Options are A to J, each a different machine.

So perhaps the two initial options are included in the options A-J. Let me check.

Looking at the options:

Option A: $275 machine. So that's one of the initial options.

Option B: $320 machine. That's the other initial option before discount.

Option C: $320 with 20% discount. So that's a third option.

So the two initial options are A and B, and the other options are additional.

So the initial question is comparing A ($275) and B ($320), but then the options include other possibilities. So perhaps the correct approach is to calculate all options and choose the best.

In that case, the best is G at $212.50, so the answer is G, and the saving compared to the next best, which is C at $256, is $43.50.

But the question says "how much will you save by buying it instead of the other one." So perhaps "it" is the best buy, and "the other one" is the alternative in the initial comparison.

Wait, but if the initial options are A and B, and the best is G, then the saving would be compared to either A or B.

If the best is G at $212.50, then compared to A ($275), saving is $62.50. Compared to B ($320), saving is $320 - $212.50 = $107.50. But the initial question only presents A and B as options, but the options A-J include more.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only comparing A and B, and the correct answer is A, saving $5 over B.

But the options A-J include other possibilities, so perhaps the correct approach is to pick the best among all options, which is G.

So the answer is G.
</think>

The best buy is option G, costing $212.50, which is the cheapest among all options. The savings compared to the next cheapest option, C at $256, is $43.50.
