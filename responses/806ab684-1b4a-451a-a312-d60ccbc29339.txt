Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about equivalent expressions. I'm a bit rusty on algebra, but I'll try to work through each option step by step. Let's see what each option says and figure out which pair is equivalent.

The question asks which pair of expressions are equivalent. The options are labeled A through G, each with two expressions. I need to check each pair to see if they're equal for all values of x.

Starting with option A: 2x + 2x and 2x². Let me simplify the first expression. 2x + 2x is 4x. The second expression is 2x squared, which is 2x². So 4x vs. 2x². Are these the same? Well, unless x is 0 or 2, they won't be equal. For example, if x=1, 4x is 4, and 2x² is 2. Not equal. So A isn't the right answer.

Moving to option B: x + x + x + x and x⁴. Let's add up the x terms. That's 4x. The second expression is x to the fourth power. Again, unless x is 0 or 1, they won't be equal. For x=2, 4x is 8, and x⁴ is 16. Not the same. So B is out.

Option C: 3x + 5x and 15x. Adding 3x and 5x gives 8x. The second expression is 15x. These can't be equivalent because 8x ≠ 15x unless x=0. So C isn't correct.

Option D: 4(2x - 6) and 8x - 24. Let's expand the first expression. 4 times 2x is 8x, and 4 times -6 is -24. So 4(2x-6) simplifies to 8x -24, which is exactly the second expression. So D looks like it's the correct pair because both expressions are the same after simplification.

Just to be thorough, I'll check the remaining options quickly.

Option E: 3x + 3x +3x and 3x³. Adding the x terms gives 9x. The second is 3x cubed. These are not the same because one is linear and the other is cubic. Only equal at x=0.

Option F: 7(2x) and 9x. 7 times 2x is 14x. 9x is less than that unless x=0. So not equivalent.

Option G: x + x + x +x +x and x⁵. That's 5x vs. x⁵. Only equal if x=0 or x=5, but not for all x. So not equivalent.

So the only pair that's equivalent is option D.

The correct answer is D because both expressions simplify to the same result.

Answer: D
