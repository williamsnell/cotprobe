The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"The struggle against neo-colonialism is not aimed at excluding the capital of the developed world from operating in less developed countries. It is aimed at preventing the financial power of the developed countries being used in such a way as to impoverish the less developed.
Non-alignment, as practiced by Ghana and many other countries, is based on co-operation with all States whether they be capitalist, socialist or have a mixed economy. Such a policy, therefore, involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investmentsâ€¦The question is one of power. A State in the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny."
Kwame Nkrumah, Neo-Colonialism, 1965

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question here about a quote from Kwame Nkrumah's "Neo-Colonialism" from 1965. The question is about what the co-operation mentioned refers to. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the context of the quote. Nkrumah is talking about non-alignment, which was a policy adopted by some countries during the Cold War. Non-alignment meant that these nations didn't take sides with either the capitalist (led by the US) or communist (led by the Soviet Union) blocs. Instead, they tried to maintain independence and cooperation with all states regardless of their political system.

The second paragraph mentions cooperation with all states, whether capitalist, socialist, or mixed economies. So the cooperation here is about working with different types of countries without aligning with either major superpower. This sounds a lot like the Cold War era when there was a division between the two main ideological camps.

Now, looking at the options, I need to see which event or period involved competing ideologies that non-aligned countries would be referring to. 

Option F is about the competing ideologies of the Cold War. That makes sense because during the Cold War, the world was divided into two main ideological groups: capitalism vs. communism. Non-alignment was a response to this division, allowing countries to cooperate with both without being controlled by either.

Other options don't fit as well. For example, options A, C, D, E, G, H, I, J refer to historical events or periods like World Wars, Crusades, Industrial Revolution, etc., which don't align with the Cold War context Nkrumah is discussing. Options B and F: B is about colonization companies, which is more about the Scramble for Africa, not ideologies during the Cold War.

So the correct answer should be F: The competing ideologies of the Cold War.

The co-operation mentioned refers to the non-alignment policy during the Cold War, where countries like Ghana aimed to work with all states without taking sides between capitalist and communist nations.

Answer: F
