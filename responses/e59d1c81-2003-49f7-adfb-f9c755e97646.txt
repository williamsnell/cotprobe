Question:

A 32-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after being struck by a car while driving his motorcycle. He reports severe pelvic pain. On examination, there is bruising of the perineum and pain is elicited with motion of his pelvis. Blood is noted at the urethral meatus. There is no other penile trauma. A plain x-ray shows a fracture of the superior pubic ramus and retrograde urethrography is done to evaluate for a urethral disruption. Which of the following portions of the urethra would be at greatest risk for injury in this patient?

Options:

A: Spongy
B: Posterior
C: Intramural (pre-prostatic)
D: Prostatic
E: Proximal
F: Penile
G: Bulbous
H: Anterior
I: Membranous
J: Distal

Okay, so I've got this question here about a patient who was hit by a car while on his motorcycle. He's 32 years old and presents with severe pelvic pain. Let me try to break down the situation and figure out what's going on.

First, the patient has bruising on the perineum, which is the area between the anus and the scrotum. That makes sense because a motorcycle accident, especially being struck by a car, could cause significant impact to that region. The fact that moving his pelvis causes pain suggests possible pelvic fractures or soft tissue damage. Pelvic fractures can be serious because they might affect the stability of the pelvis and surrounding structures.

He also mentions blood at the urethral meatus, which is the opening of the urethra. That's concerning because it could indicate a urethral injury. Urethral injuries are often seen in pelvic fractures, particularly in males, since the urethra is long and can be vulnerable to damage when the pelvis is involved.

The plain x-ray shows a fracture of the superior pubic ramus. The pubic rami are the parts of the pelvis that make up the pubic bone. The superior pubic ramus is the upper part, and a fracture there can cause significant issues, including potential damage to nearby structures like the urethra.

The next step in evaluation is retrograde urethrography. I remember that this procedure involves injecting contrast dye into the urethra to see if there's any damage or blockage. It's often used to diagnose urethral strictures or injuries, especially in cases where a pelvic fracture is suspected.

Now, the question is asking which part of the urethra is at greatest risk for injury in this patient. The urethra is divided into different parts: the spongy (or penile), bulbous, membranous, and prostatic regions. Each part is located in different areas of the male genital tract.

In this scenario, the patient has a pelvic fracture, specifically a superior pubic ramus fracture. The urethra passes through the perineum and the pelvic area. The part that goes through the pelvic bones is the membranous urethra, which is the most fixed part of the urethra. When there's a pelvic fracture, especially involving the pubic bones, the surrounding tissues can be torn, and the urethra can be compressed or lacerated.

Looking at the options:

A: Spongy - This is the part in the penis, less likely to be injured in a pelvic fracture.
B: Posterior - Not sure about this one; maybe part of the bulbous or membranous.
C: Intramural (pre-prostatic) - This is where the urethra is within the prostate, but I think the membranous is more at risk here.
D: Prostatic - Part of the urethra within the prostate, but again, the injury is more likely in the pelvic area.
E: Proximal - Maybe refers to the top part, but I'm not certain.
F: Penile - Same as spongy; probably not.
G: Bulbous - This is where the urethra is surrounded by the bulb of the penis; possible but maybe not the highest risk.
H: Anterior - Not sure, but maybe refers to the front part.
I: Membranous - This is the part that goes through the pelvic bones and perineum, so high risk.
J: Distal - Farther along, maybe towards the penis.

Putting it all together, the most likely part to be injured is the membranous urethra because it's in the area where the pelvic fracture occurred. The retrograde urethrography would help visualize any tears or strictures in this area.

The patient's pelvic fracture, specifically the superior pubic ramus, places the membranous urethra at greatest risk for injury. This is because the membranous urethra passes through the pelvic bones and perineum, areas prone to damage during a pelvic fracture. Retrograde urethrography would help assess this area for injury.

Answer: I
