Okay, so I've got this problem about a swimming pool volume, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see. The pool is circular with a 40-foot diameter. That means the radius is half of that, so 20 feet. Got that down.

The depth is constant along east-west lines, which I think means that if you look from east to west, the depth doesn't change. But it increases linearly from 2 feet at the south end to 7 feet at the north end. So, from south to north, the depth goes up by 5 feet over the length of the pool.

Wait, so the pool is circular, but the depth changes along the north-south direction. Hmm. So, the pool is like a cylinder but with a varying depth from south to north. That sounds like a shape that's a bit more complex than a simple cylinder. Maybe it's a kind of truncated cone or something else. Or perhaps it's a cylindrical pool with a slope on the bottom from south to north.

I think the way to approach this is to model the pool as a series of thin slices along the north-south axis and then integrate to find the volume. Since the depth changes linearly, integration might be the way to go.

First, let's visualize the pool. It's circular, so the east-west diameter is 40 feet, radius 20 feet. The depth varies from 2 ft at the south end to 7 ft at the north end. So, if I imagine slicing the pool into thin, horizontal strips perpendicular to the north-south axis, each strip has a certain depth.

Wait, but since it's a circular pool, each strip would actually be a rectangle when viewed in cross-section along the north-south direction, but the pool's radius is 20 feet, so the width of each strip (east-west) would be the diameter, 40 feet, but wait, no. Wait, in the north-south direction, the pool is 40 feet in diameter, but the depth varies along that axis.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as a cylindrical coordinate system. The pool has a radius of 20 feet in the east-west direction, and the depth varies along the north-south (let's say z-axis) direction. Hmm, maybe it's better to model it as a 2D shape revolved around an axis.

Alternatively, perhaps the pool is a combination of a cylinder and a slope. Wait, no, perhaps it's a prism with a varying height. Since the depth increases linearly from south to north, each point along the north-south line has a certain depth.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think of the pool as a 2D shape when viewed from above, which is a circle, and then the depth varies along one diameter (north-south). So, each point along the north-south diameter has a certain depth, and the east-west width is always 40 feet. Hmm, perhaps not, because the pool is circular, so the east-west width varies depending on where you are along the north-south axis.

Wait, maybe I should model this as a surface of revolution. If the pool is circular, then the cross-section along the north-south line is a rectangle that's 40 feet wide (east-west) and has varying depth from 2 to 7 feet. But wait, no, that would make it a rectangle, not a circle. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of a circle with radius 20 feet, and the depth varies along the y-axis (north-south). So, at any point (x, y) in the circle, the depth is a function of y. Let me define the coordinate system: let’s center the pool at the origin (0,0) in the x-y plane, where x is east-west and y is north-south. So the equation of the circle is x² + y² = 20² = 400.

The depth at any point y (north-south) varies linearly from 2 ft at y = -20 (south end) to 7 ft at y = 20 (north end). Wait, no, because the diameter is 40 feet, so from y = -20 to y = +20. Wait, no, actually, the pool's diameter is 40 feet, so from y = -20 to y = +20, but the depth at y = -20 is 2 ft, and at y = +20 it's 7 ft. So the depth as a function of y would be linear.

Let me model the depth as a function of y. The depth at y = -20 is 2 ft, and at y = +20, it's 7 ft. So, the change in depth is 5 ft over a distance of 40 ft (from y=-20 to y=+20). So the depth at any point y is given by depth(y) = 2 + (5/40)(y + 20). Wait, let me check that: at y=-20, depth is 2, which fits. At y=+20, depth is 2 + (5/40)(40) = 2 +5=7. Correct.

So, depth(y) = 2 + (5/40)(y + 20) = 2 + (1/8)(y +20) = 2 + y/8 + 20/8 = 2 + y/8 + 2.5 = 4.5 + y/8. Wait, that can't be right because when y=-20, 4.5 + (-20)/8 = 4.5 - 2.5 = 2, which is correct, and when y=20, 4.5 + 20/8 = 4.5 + 2.5 = 7, which is correct. So, depth(y) = 4.5 + (y)/8.

Now, to find the volume, I can integrate the depth over the area of the pool. Since the pool is circular, and the depth varies with y, the volume would be the integral over the area of the pool of depth(y) dA.

But since the pool is symmetric around the y-axis, maybe it's easier to set up the integral in polar coordinates or use a method that takes advantage of the circle's symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the volume by integrating along the y-axis. For each y, the width in the x-direction is determined by the circle's equation x² + y² = 400, so x goes from -sqrt(400 - y²) to +sqrt(400 - y²), which is a width of 2*sqrt(400 - y²). And the depth at each y is depth(y) = 4.5 + y/8.

Wait, but wait a second, is the depth function dependent only on y? Yes, because the depth increases linearly from south (y=-20) to north (y=20), and the pool's cross-section at any y is a horizontal strip with width 40 feet (from x=-20 to x=20 at y=0, but actually, at other y's, it's less). Wait, no, wait, the pool is circular, so at a given y, the width in the x-direction is 2*sqrt(400 - y²). So, for each y, the area is (2*sqrt(400 - y²)) * depth(y) * dy. Wait, no, because the pool is 2D in x and y, but the depth is in the z-direction, so for each infinitesimal strip at position y, the volume would be (width in x) * depth(y) * dy.

Wait, but I think I should model it as a 3D object. So, the pool is a circle in the x-y plane, and at each point (x,y), the depth is depth(y) as defined. So, the volume would be the integral over x and y of depth(y) dx dy.

But since the function is symmetric around the y-axis, maybe it's easier to compute it in polar coordinates or use a method that slices along y.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the volume by integrating in the y-direction. For each y, the width in x is 2*sqrt(400 - y²), and the depth is depth(y). So, the volume would be the integral from y = -20 to y = +20 of [2*sqrt(400 - y²)] * [4.5 + y/8] dy.

That sounds correct. So, let's set up the integral:

V = ∫ from y=-20 to y=20 of [2*sqrt(400 - y²)] * [4.5 + y/8] dy.

Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Let me see if I can split this into two separate integrals:

V = 2 * ∫ from -20 to 20 sqrt(400 - y²) * (4.5 + y/8) dy

= 2 * [4.5 ∫ sqrt(400 - y²) dy + (1/8) ∫ y*sqrt(400 - y²) dy] evaluated from -20 to 20.

Now, let's compute each integral separately.

First integral: I1 = ∫ sqrt(400 - y²) dy from -20 to 20.

This is a standard integral. The integral of sqrt(a² - y²) dy from -a to a is (π a²)/2. Wait, no, wait: ∫ sqrt(a² - y²) dy from -a to a is (π a²)/2. Because it's the area of a semicircle. So, for a=20, I1 = (π * 20²)/2 = (π * 400)/2 = 200π.

Second integral: I2 = ∫ y * sqrt(400 - y²) dy from -20 to 20.

Let me check if this is an odd function. The integrand y*sqrt(400 - y²) is an odd function because sqrt(400 - y²) is even, and y is odd, so their product is odd. The integral of an odd function over symmetric limits (-a to a) is zero. So I2 = 0.

So, putting it back together:

V = 2 * [4.5 * I1 + (1/8) * I2] = 2 * [4.5 * 200π + (1/8)*0] = 2 * (900π) ) = 1800π.

Wait, but let me double-check. The first integral I1 is 200π, so 4.5 * I1 is 4.5 * 200π = 900π. Then, the second integral is zero. So, V = 2*(900π) = 1800π.

Looking at the options, option A is 1800π ft³. So that should be the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in setting up the integral. So, the pool is a circle in x-y, and the depth varies with y. So, for each y, the width in x is 2*sqrt(400 - y²), and the depth is 4.5 + y/8. So, the volume is the integral over y from -20 to 20 of (2*sqrt(400 - y²))*(4.5 + y/8) dy. That seems correct.

Also, when I split the integral, I correctly identified that the second part is zero due to being an odd function. So, the volume is 2*(4.5 * 200π) = 1800π.

So, the answer should be option A: 1800π ft³.

The swimming pool is circular with a 40-foot diameter, giving a radius of 20 feet. The depth increases linearly from 2 feet at the south end to 7 feet at the north end. To find the volume, we model the depth as a function of the north-south position (y-axis). The depth at any point y is given by \( \text{depth}(y) = 4.5 + \frac{y}{8} \). The volume is calculated by integrating this depth function over the circular area. Using symmetry and standard integrals, the volume is found to be \( 1800\pi \, \text{ft}^3 \).
