Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I have this problem where I need to evaluate the gradient of a scalar field f at the point (2, 3, 5). The scalar field is given by f(x₁, x₂, x₃) = 2 sin x₁ - x₁² x₂ x₃ + x₁ e^(x₂) 2(1). Hmm, wait, that last term looks a bit confusing. Let me make sure I parse it correctly. It says x₁ e^(x₂) 2(1). Maybe that's a typo, perhaps it's x₁ e^(x₂) *2*1? Or maybe it's x₁ multiplied by e^(x₂) times 2 times 1. Alternatively, maybe it's x₁ e^(x₂ * 2 * 1), but that would be x₁ e^(2x₂). I'm a bit confused here. Let me check the original problem again.

Wait, the function is f(x₁, x₂, x₃) = 2 sin x₁ - x₁² x₂ x₃ + x₁ e^(x₂) 2(1). Hmm, perhaps the last term is x₁ times e raised to x₂ times 2 times 1. So that would be x₁ * e^(2x₂). Or perhaps it's x₁ * e^(x₂) multiplied by 2*1, which is 2. So maybe the term is 2x₁ e^(x₂). That makes more sense. So the function could be f = 2 sin x₁ - x₁² x₂ x₃ + 2 x₁ e^(x₂). That seems plausible. I'll go with that interpretation because otherwise, the 2(1) part is unclear. So f(x) = 2 sin x₁ - x₁² x₂ x₃ + 2 x₁ e^(x₂).

Now, I need to compute the gradient of f, which is ∇f. The gradient is a vector with the partial derivatives with respect to each variable x₁, x₂, x₃. So let's compute each partial derivative.

First, ∂f/∂x₁:

The function has three terms: 2 sin x₁, -x₁² x₂ x₃, and 2x₁ e^(x₂).

- The derivative of 2 sin x₁ with respect to x₁ is 2 cos x₁.
- The derivative of -x₁² x₂ x₃ with respect to x₁ is -2 x₁ x₂ x₃.
- The derivative of 2x₁ e^(x₂) with respect to x₁ is 2 e^(x₂).

So ∂f/∂x₁ = 2 cos x₁ - 2 x₁ x₂ x₃ + 2 e^(x₂).

Next, ∂f/∂x₂:

Again, looking at each term:

- The derivative of 2 sin x₁ with respect to x₂ is 0.
- The derivative of -x₁² x₂ x₃ with respect to x₂ is -x₁² x₃.
- The derivative of 2x₁ e^(x₂) with respect to x₂ is 2x₁ e^(x₂).

So ∂f/∂x₂ = -x₁² x₃ + 2 x₁ e^(x₂).

Third, ∂f/∂x₃:

Looking at each term:

- The derivative of 2 sin x₁ with respect to x₃ is 0.
- The derivative of -x₁² x₂ x₃ with respect to x₃ is -x₁² x₂.
- The derivative of 2x₁ e^(x₂) with respect to x₃ is 0.

So ∂f/∂x₃ = -x₁² x₂.

Now, I need to evaluate each of these partial derivatives at the point (2,3,5). So x₁=2, x₂=3, x₃=5.

Let me compute each component step by step.

First, ∂f/∂x₁:

Compute each term:

1. 2 cos x₁: x₁=2, so cos(2) ≈ -0.4161. So 2*(-0.4161) ≈ -0.8322.
2. -2 x₁ x₂ x₃: x₁=2, x₂=3, x₃=5. So 2*2*3*5 = 2*30=60. So -60.
3. 2 e^(x₂): x₂=3. e^3 ≈ 20.0855. So 2*20.0855 ≈ 40.171.

Adding them together: -0.8322 -60 +40.171 ≈ (-60.8322) +40.171 ≈ -20.6612. Wait, that's approximately -20.66. Looking at the options, the first component is varying, but let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs. Let me recheck:

∂f/∂x₁ = 2 cos x₁ - 2 x₁ x₂ x₃ + 2 e^(x₂).

So 2 cos(2) ≈ 2*(-0.4161) ≈ -0.8322.

Then, -2*(2)*(3)*(5) = -2*30= -60.

Then, 2*e^3 ≈ 2*(20.0855) ≈ 40.171.

Adding them: -0.8322 -60 +40.171 = (-0.8322 -60) +40.171 = (-60.8322) +40.171 ≈ -20.6612. So approximately -20.66.

Wait, but looking at the options, the first component's numbers are around 40.74, -30.74, etc. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the function. Alternatively, perhaps the function is f = 2 sin x₁ - x₁² x₂ x₃ + x₁ e^(x₂ * 2 *1), which would be x₁ e^(2x₂). Let me check that.

If the last term is x₁ e^(2x₂), then:

∂f/∂x₁ would be 2 cos x₁ - 2x₁x₂x₃ + e^(2x₂).

Wait, no, because the derivative of x₁ e^(2x₂) with respect to x₁ is e^(2x₂).

So let me recompute ∂f/∂x₁:

If f = 2 sin x₁ -x₁² x₂ x₃ + x₁ e^(2x₂).

Then ∂f/∂x₁ = 2 cos x₁ - 2x₁ x₂ x₃ + e^(2x₂).

At x₂=3, e^(6) ≈ 403.4288.

So computing:

2 cos(2) ≈ -0.8322.

-2*(2)*(3)*(5) = -60.

+ e^(6) ≈ 403.4288.

Adding them: -0.8322 -60 +403.4288 ≈ (-60.8322) +403.4288 ≈ 342.5966. That's a much larger number, but looking at the options, the first component isn't that big. So perhaps my initial interpretation was correct, and the last term is 2x₁ e^(x₂), not x₁ e^(2x₂).

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the partial derivatives. Let me go back.

Wait, in the original function, is the last term x₁ e^(x₂) multiplied by 2(1)? So perhaps it's 2x₁ e^(x₂). So the function is f = 2 sin x₁ -x₁² x₂ x₃ + 2x₁ e^(x₂). Then, the partial derivatives would be as I calculated earlier.

So ∂f/∂x₁: 2 cos x₁ -2 x₁ x₂ x₃ + 2 e^(x₂).

At (2,3,5):

2 cos(2) ≈ 2*(-0.4161) ≈ -0.8322.

-2*(2)*(3)*(5) = -60.

+2 e^(3) ≈ 2*(20.0855) ≈40.171.

Adding them: -0.8322 -60 +40.171 ≈ -20.6612. So approximately -20.66.

Wait, but looking at the options, the first components are 40.74, -30.74, 0, 30.74, etc. None of these match -20.66. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the math.

Wait, 2 cos(2): cos(2 radians) is approximately -0.4161, so 2*(-0.4161) ≈ -0.8322.

-2*(2)=4? Wait, no: Wait, ∂f/∂x₁ is 2 cos x₁ -2 x₁ x₂ x₃ +2 e^(x₂).

Wait, x₁ is 2, x₂ is 3, x₃ is5.

So -2 x₁ x₂ x₃ = -2 *2 *3 *5 = -60.

2 e^(x₂) = 2 * e^3 ≈ 2*20.0855≈40.171.

So total: 2 cos(2) is about -0.8322. So -0.8322 -60 +40.171= (-60.8322) +40.171= -20.661.

But none of the options have the first component around -20.66. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A: (40.74, -20.17, 12)

B: (-30.74,10.17,-2)

C: (0,40.34,24)

D: (30.74,10.17,2)

E: (40.74,20.17,-12)

F: (-40.74,20.17,-12)

G: (30.74,-20.17,-12)

H: (-40.74,-20.17,12)

I: (-30.74,-10.17,2)

J: (40.74,20.17,12)

Hmm, option G has first component 30.74, second -20.17, third -12.

Wait, but my ∂f/∂x₁ is around -20.66, which is close to option G's second component of -20.17. So perhaps I made a mistake in the first component.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated ∂f/∂x₁. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe the function is f = 2 sin x₁ -x₁² x₂ x₃ + x₁ e^(x₂) * 2 *1. So that's x₁ e^(x₂) * 2, which is 2x₁ e^(x₂). So my calculation was correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Compute 2 cos(2):

2 * cos(2 radians) = 2 * (-0.4161468365) ≈ -0.832293673.

-2 x₁ x₂ x₃ = -2 *2*3*5= -60.

2 e^3: e^3 ≈20.085536923, so 2*20.0855≈40.171073846.

Adding: (-0.832293673) + (-60) +40.171073846 = (-60.832293673) +40.171073846 ≈ (-20.661219827).

So approximately -20.66.

Looking at the options, the only option with a second component around -20 is option G, which has second component -20.17. So perhaps the first component is 30.74, and the third component is -12. Let me see if that makes sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first component. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps the function is f = 2 sin x₁ -x₁² x₂ x₃ + x₁ e^(x₂ * 2 *1), which would be x₁ e^(2x₂). Let me try that.

Then, ∂f/∂x₁ would be 2 cos x₁ -2x₁x₂x₃ + e^(2x₂).

At x₂=3, e^(6) ≈403.4288.

So ∂f/∂x₁ at (2,3,5) is:

2 cos(2) ≈-0.8322.

-2*2*3*5= -60.

+ e^(6)≈403.4288.

Total: -0.8322 -60 +403.4288 ≈ 342.5966. That's way larger than any option's first component. So probably not.

So back to the original function: f = 2 sin x₁ -x₁² x₂ x₃ + 2x₁ e^(x₂).

So ∂f/∂x₁ is about -20.66.

Looking at the options, none have the first component around -20.66, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the function is different.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the function is f = 2 sin x₁ -x₁² x₂ x₃ + x₁ e^(x₂^2). So x₂ squared times something? Or maybe x₁ e^(x₂^2). Let me see.

If the last term is x₁ e^(x₂^2), then ∂f/∂x₁ would be 2 cos x₁ -2x₁x₂x₃ + e^(x₂^2).

At x₂=3, x₂^2=9, e^9 is about 8103.08. That's way too big, so probably not.

Alternatively, perhaps the function has a typo, and it's f = 2 sin x₁ -x₁² x₂ x₃ + x₁ e^(x₂) *2. So 2x₁ e^(x₂). Which is what I thought earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the other partial derivatives to see if they match any options.

Compute ∂f/∂x₂:

From earlier, ∂f/∂x₂ = -x₁² x₃ + 2x₁ e^(x₂).

At (2,3,5):

- (2)^2 *5 = -4*5= -20.

+ 2*(2)*e^(3) ≈4 *20.0855≈80.342.

Total: -20 +80.342 ≈60.342.

Looking at the options, the second components are: A: -20.17, B:10.17, C:40.34, D:10.17, E:20.17, F:20.17, G:-20.17, H:-20.17, I:-10.17, J:20.17.

Wait, 60.34 is not close to any of these. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the function. Let me re-examine the function again.

The function is f(x₁, x₂, x₃) = 2 sin x₁ - x₁² x₂ x₃ + x₁ e^(x)2(1).

Wait, perhaps the term is x₁ e^(x₂) * 2 *1, which is 2x₁ e^(x₂). So that's correct.

Wait, but when I computed ∂f/∂x₂, I get 60.34, which doesn't match any options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the partial derivative.

Wait, ∂f/∂x₂ for the term 2x₁ e^(x₂) is 2x₁ e^(x₂). At x₁=2, x₂=3: 2*2*e^3=4*20.0855≈80.342.

So ∂f/∂x₂ = -x₁² x₃ +2x₁ e^(x₂) = -4*5 +80.342= -20 +80.342=60.342.

But none of the options have a second component around 60. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in interpreting the function. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the function is f = 2 sin x₁ - x₁² x₂ x₃ + x₁ e^(x₂*2*1), which is x₁ e^(2x₂). Let me compute ∂f/∂x₂ in that case.

If f = 2 sin x₁ -x₁²x₂x₃ +x₁ e^(2x₂), then ∂f/∂x₂ is:

Derivative of 2 sin x₁ is 0.

Derivative of -x₁²x₂x₃ with respect to x₂ is -x₁²x₃.

Derivative of x₁ e^(2x₂) with respect to x₂ is x₁ * 2 e^(2x₂).

So ∂f/∂x₂ = -x₁²x₃ + 2x₁ e^(2x₂).

At (2,3,5):

- (2)^2 *5 = -4*5= -20.

+ 2*2*e^(6) ≈4 *403.4288≈1613.715.

So ∂f/∂x₂ ≈ -20 +1613.715≈1593.715. That's way too big, so not matching any options.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me try computing the third partial derivative.

Compute ∂f/∂x₃:

From earlier, ∂f/∂x₃ = -x₁² x₂.

At (2,3,5): -(2)^2 *3= -4*3= -12.

Looking at the options, the third components are:

A:12

B:-2

C:24

D:2

E:-12

F:-12

G:-12

H:12

I:2

J:12

So ∂f/∂x₃ is -12. That matches options E, F, G, H.

Wait, in my earlier calculation, ∂f/∂x₁ was approximately -20.66, which is close to option G's second component (-20.17). So perhaps I made a mistake in the first component.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the function is f = 2 sin x₁ - x₁² x₂ x₃ + x₁ e^(x₂) * 2 *1, which is 2x₁ e^(x₂).

So ∂f/∂x₁ is 2 cos x₁ -2x₁x₂x₃ + 2 e^(x₂).

Wait, but earlier I thought the third term was 2 e^(x₂), but perhaps it's 2x₁ e^(x₂). No, the function is 2x₁ e^(x₂), so the derivative with respect to x₁ is 2 e^(x₂).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs. Let me recompute ∂f/∂x₁:

2 cos x₁ - 2x₁x₂x₃ + 2 e^(x₂).

At (2,3,5):

2 cos(2) ≈2*(-0.4161)= -0.8322.

-2*2*3*5= -60.

+ 2*e^3≈2*20.0855≈40.171.

So sum: -0.8322 -60 +40.171= (-60.8322)+40.171≈-20.6612.

So ∂f/∂x₁≈-20.66.

Looking at the options, option G has the second component as -20.17, which is close. So perhaps the first component is 30.74, as in option G.

Wait, but how? Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating ∂f/∂x₁. Alternatively, perhaps the function is different.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the function is f = 2 sin x₁ - x₁² x₂ x₃ + x₁ e^(x₂) *2*1, which is 2x₁ e^(x₂). So ∂f/∂x₁ is 2 e^(x₂) (from 2x₁ e^(x₂)).

Wait, no, the derivative of 2x₁ e^(x₂) with respect to x₁ is 2 e^(x₂). So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the function is f = 2 sin x₁ - x₁² x₂ x₃ + x₁ e^(x₂) * 2 *1, but maybe the 2 is applied differently. Alternatively, perhaps the function is f = 2 sin x₁ - x₁² x₂ x₃ + x₁ (e^(x₂))^2. No, that would complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is f = 2 sin x₁ - x₁² x₂ x₃ + x₁ e^(x₂) * 2 *1, which is 2x₁ e^(x₂). So as before.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the other partial derivatives more accurately and see if they match any options.

Compute ∂f/∂x₂ again:

From earlier, ∂f/∂x₂ = -x₁² x₃ + 2x₁ e^(x₂).

At (2,3,5):

- (2)^2 *5 = -4*5= -20.

+ 2*2*e^3 ≈4 *20.0855≈80.342.

Total: -20 +80.342≈60.342.

But none of the options have a second component around 60.34. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the function has a typo, and the term is x₁ e^(x₂ x_3). Then, the function would be f = 2 sin x₁ -x₁² x₂ x₃ + x₁ e^(x₂ x₃). Let's try that.

Then, ∂f/∂x₂ would be:

- x₁² x₃ + x₁ e^(x₂ x₃) * x₃.

Wait, because derivative of x₁ e^(x₂ x₃) with respect to x₂ is x₁ * e^(x₂ x₃) * x₃.

So ∂f/∂x₂ = -x₁² x₃ + x₁ x₃ e^(x₂ x₃).

At (2,3,5):

- (2)^2 *5= -4*5= -20.

+ 2*5 e^(3*5)=10 e^15. e^15 is about 3.269 million, so 10*3.269e6≈32.69 million. That's way too big, so probably not.

Hmm, this is getting frustrating. Let me try to compute all three partial derivatives more accurately.

Compute ∂f/∂x₁:

2 cos(2) ≈ 2*(-0.4161468365)= -0.832293673.

-2x₁x₂x₃= -2*2*3*5= -60.

2e^3≈40.171073846.

Sum: -0.832293673 -60 +40.171073846= (-60.832293673)+40.171073846≈-20.661219827.

So ∂f/∂x₁≈-20.66.

Compute ∂f/∂x₂:

-x₁²x₃ +2x₁e^(x₂).

At (2,3,5):

-4*5= -20.

+2*2*e^3=4*20.0855≈80.342.

So sum: -20 +80.342≈60.342.

Compute ∂f/∂x₃:

-x₁²x₂= -4*3= -12.

So gradient is approximately (-20.66, 60.34, -12).

Looking at the options, none match this. The closest is option E: (40.74,20.17,-12), but the first and second components don't match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the function. Let me read the problem again.

Wait, the function is f(x₁,x₂,x₃) = 2 sin x₁ - x₁² x₂ x₃ + x₁ e^(x)2(1).

Wait, perhaps the term is x₁ e^(x₂) multiplied by 2(1), which is 2. So the term is 2x₁ e^(x₂). That's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the function is f = 2 sin x₁ -x₁² x₂ x₃ +x₁ e^(x₂ x_3). Let me try that.

Then, ∂f/∂x₁=2 cos x₁ -2x₁x₂x₃ +e^(x₂x₃).

At (2,3,5):

2 cos(2)≈-0.8322.

-2*2*3*5= -60.

+e^(3*5)=e^15≈3.269 million. So total≈-60.8322 +3.269e6≈3,268,939.1678. That's way too big.

No, that can't be right. So perhaps I should consider that I might have misread the function.

Wait, perhaps the function is f = 2 sin x₁ - x₁² x₂ x₃ +x₁ e^(x₂) * 2*1, which is 2x₁ e^(x₂). So as before.

Given that, perhaps the gradient components are:

∂f/∂x₁≈-20.66,

∂f/∂x₂≈60.34,

∂f/∂x₃= -12.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the function is f = 2 sin x₁ -x₁² x₂ x₃ +x₁ e^(2x₂). Let's try that.

Then, ∂f/∂x₁=2 cos x₁ -2x₁x₂x₃ + e^(2x₂).

At (2,3,5):

2 cos(2)=≈-0.8322.

-2*2*3*5= -60.

+e^(6)=≈403.4288.

So sum≈-0.8322 -60 +403.4288≈342.5966.

∂f/∂x₂= -x₁²x₃ +2x₁ e^(2x₂).

At (2,3,5):

-4*5= -20.

+2*2 e^(6)=4 *403.4288≈1613.715.

So sum≈-20 +1613.715≈1593.715.

∂f/∂x₃= -x₁²x₂= -4*3= -12.

So gradient≈(342.5966, 1593.715, -12). Doesn't match any options.

Hmm, perhaps I should try a different approach. Let me look at the options and see which one has ∂f/∂x₃= -12, which is E, F, G, H.

Now, among these, let's see if any have ∂f/∂x₁≈-20.66 and ∂f/∂x₂≈60.34.

Looking at the options:

Option G: (30.74, -20.17, -12)

Option H: (-40.74, -20.17,12)

Option F: (-40.74,20.17,-12)

Option E: (40.74,20.17,-12)

None have the second component around 60. So perhaps I made a mistake in the function.

Wait, perhaps the function is f = 2 sin x₁ -x₁² x₂ x₃ +x₁ e^(x₂) + x₁ e^(x₂). So that would be 2x₁ e^(x₂). Wait, no, that's the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is f = 2 sin x₁ -x₁² x₂ x₃ +x₁ e^(x₂)*2*1, which is 2x₁ e^(x₂). So same as before.

Wait, perhaps the function is f = 2 sin x₁ -x₁^2 x₂ x₃ + x₁ e^{x₂ *2 *1}, which is x₁ e^{2x₂}. Then:

∂f/∂x₁=2 cos x₁ -2x₁x₂x₃ + e^{2x₂}.

At (2,3,5):

2 cos(2)=≈-0.8322.

-2*2*3*5= -60.

+e^6≈403.4288.

Sum≈-0.8322 -60 +403.4288≈342.5966.

∂f/∂x₂= -x₁²x₃ + 2x₁ e^{2x₂}.

At (2,3,5):

-4*5= -20.

+2*2 e^6≈4*403.4288≈1613.715.

Sum≈-20 +1613.715≈1593.715.

∂f/∂x₃= -x₁²x₂= -4*3= -12.

So gradient≈(342.5966,1593.715, -12). Not matching any options.

I'm stuck. Let me try to think differently.

Perhaps the function is f = 2 sin x₁ -x₁² x₂ x₃ +x₁ e^{(x₂)(2)(1)}, which is x₁ e^{2x₂}.

Then, partial derivatives as above.

But again, the components don't match any options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the function is f = 2 sin x₁ -x₁² x₂ x₃ +x₁ e^{x₂} *2*1, which is 2x₁ e^{x₂}.

So ∇f = (2 cos x₁ -2x₁x₂x₃ +2 e^{x₂}, -x₁²x₃ +2x₁ e^{x₂}, -x₁²x₂).

At (2,3,5):

First component: 2 cos(2)=≈-0.8322.

-2*2*3*5= -60.

+2 e^3≈40.171.

Total≈-0.8322 -60 +40.171≈-20.661.

Second component: -4*5= -20.

+2*2 e^3≈80.342.

Total≈60.342.

Third component: -4*3= -12.

So gradient≈(-20.66,60.34,-12).

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the function is different.

Wait, perhaps the function is f = 2 sin x₁ -x₁² x₂ x₃ +x₁ e^{x₂} *2*1, which is 2x₁ e^{x₂}.

Wait, let me check the options again. The only option with third component -12 is E, F, G, H.

Option G has (30.74, -20.17, -12).

So perhaps ∂f/∂x₁≈30.74, ∂f/∂x₂≈-20.17, ∂f/∂x₃=-12.

Wait, that would mean:

∂f/∂x₁=30.74, which would require:

2 cos x₁ -2x₁x₂x₃ +2 e^{x₂}=30.74.

With x₁=2, x₂=3, x₃=5.

Compute:

2 cos(2)=≈-0.8322.

-2*2*3*5= -60.

+2 e^3≈40.171.

Sum≈-0.8322 -60 +40.171≈-20.661.

But that's not 30.74. So perhaps I made a mistake in the function.

Wait, perhaps the function is f = 2 sin x₁ -x₁² x₂ x₃ +x₁ e^{x₂} *2*1, which is 2x₁ e^{x₂}.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs. Let me recheck.

Wait, the term is -x₁² x₂ x₃, so the derivative is -2x₁x₂x₃.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is f = 2 sin x₁ -x₁² x₂ x₃ +x₁ e^{x₂} *2*1, which is 2x₁ e^{x₂}.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the partial derivatives again.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is f = 2 sin x₁ -x₁² x₂ x₃ +x₁ e^{x₂} + x₁ e^{x₂}, which would be 2x₁ e^{x₂}.

Wait, that's the same as before.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for an option where ∂f/∂x₃=-12 and see if the other components make sense.

Looking at option G: (30.74, -20.17, -12).

So ∂f/∂x₁=30.74, ∂f/∂x₂=-20.17.

Let me see if this could happen.

If ∂f/∂x₁=30.74, then:

2 cos x₁ -2x₁x₂x₃ +2 e^{x₂}=30.74.

We know that 2 cos(2)≈-0.8322, -2*2*3*5= -60, 2 e^3≈40.171.

So sum≈-0.8322 -60 +40.171≈-20.661, which is not 30.74.

So perhaps option G is not correct.

Wait, perhaps the function is f = 2 sin x₁ -x₁² x₂ x₃ +x₁ e^{x₂} *2*1, which is 2x₁ e^{x₂}.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the partial derivatives.

Wait, ∂f/∂x₁: derivative of 2 sin x₁ is 2 cos x₁.

Derivative of -x₁² x₂ x₃ is -2x₁x₂x₃.

Derivative of 2x₁ e^{x₂} is 2 e^{x₂}.

So yes, ∂f/∂x₁=2 cos x₁ -2x₁x₂x₃ +2 e^{x₂}.

At (2,3,5): 2*(-0.4161)= -0.8322, -60, +40.171.

Sum≈-20.66.

So perhaps none of the options are correct, but given the options, the closest would be option G, which has ∂f/∂x₃=-12 and ∂f/∂x₂=-20.17, which is close to my ∂f/∂x₁≈-20.66.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning which component is which. Let me think: the gradient is (∂f/∂x₁, ∂f/∂x₂, ∂f/∂x₃). So in option G, it's (30.74, -20.17, -12). So ∂f/∂x₁=30.74, which doesn't match my calculation. So perhaps I made a mistake in the function.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is f = 2 sin x₁ -x₁² x₂ x₃ +x₁ e^{x₂} *2*1, and the partial derivatives are as I calculated, but perhaps the options have a typo.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the function is f = 2 sin x₁ -x₁² x₂ x₃ +x₁ e^{(x₂ *2)*1}, which is x₁ e^{2x₂}.

Then, ∂f/∂x₁=2 cos x₁ -2x₁x₂x₃ +e^{2x₂}.

At (2,3,5):

2 cos(2)=≈-0.8322.

-2*2*3*5= -60.

+e^6≈403.4288.

Sum≈-0.8322 -60 +403.4288≈342.5966.

∂f/∂x₂= -x₁²x₃ +2x₁ e^{2x₂}.

At (2,3,5):

-4*5= -20.

+2*2 e^6≈4*403.4288≈1613.715.

Sum≈-20 +1613.715≈1593.715.

∂f/∂x₃= -x₁²x₂= -4*3= -12.

So gradient≈(342.5966,1593.715,-12). No match.

I'm really stuck. Perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the third component being -12, which points to options E, F, G, H.

Among these, option G has ∂f/∂x₁=30.74 and ∂f/∂x₂=-20.17. Since my ∂f/∂x₁ is -20.66 and ∂f/∂x₂ is 60.34, which don't match any options, perhaps the correct option is not listed. But since I have to choose, perhaps the intended answer is option G, assuming that I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is f = 2 sin x₁ -x₁² x₂ x₃ +x₁ e^{x₂} *2*1, and the partial derivatives were miscalculated.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the partial derivatives more accurately.

Compute ∂f/∂x₁:

2 cos(2)=2*(-0.416146836547192)= -0.832293673094384.

-2*2*3*5= -60.

+2*e^3=2*20.085536923187668≈40.171073846375336.

Sum: -0.832293673094384 -60 +40.171073846375336.

Compute step by step:

-0.832293673094384 -60 = -60.83229367309438.

-60.83229367309438 +40.171073846375336 = -20.66121982671904.

So ∂f/∂x₁≈-20.6612.

Similarly, ∂f/∂x₂:

-x₁²x₃= -4*5= -20.

+2x₁ e^{x₂}=2*2*e^3=4*20.085536923187668≈80.34214769275067.

Sum: -20 +80.34214769275067≈60.34214769275067.

∂f/∂x₃= -x₁²x₂= -4*3= -12.

So gradient≈(-20.6612,60.3421,-12).

No option matches this. So perhaps the intended answer is option E: (40.74,20.17,-12), but that doesn't align with my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the function. Let me check once more.

Wait, the function is given as f(x₁, x₂, x₃) = 2 sin x₁ - x₁² x₂ x₃ + x₁ e^(x)2(1). Wait, perhaps the term is x₁ e^{x₂^2 *1}, which would be x₁ e^{x₂^2}.

Then, ∂f/∂x₁=2 cos x₁ -2x₁x₂x₃ +e^{x₂^2}.

At (2,3,5):

2 cos(2)=≈-0.8322.

-2*2*3*5= -60.

+e^{9}=≈8103.08.

Sum≈-60.8322 +8103.08≈8042.25.

∂f/∂x₂= -x₁²x₃ +x₁ * 2x₂ e^{x₂^2}.

At (2,3,5):

-4*5= -20.

+2*2*3 e^{9}=12*8103.08≈97237.

Sum≈-20 +97237≈97217.

∂f/∂x₃= -x₁²x₂= -4*3= -12.

So gradient≈(8042.25,97217,-12). Not matching any options.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Given that, and considering that the only option with ∂f/∂x₃=-12 is option G, which has ∂f/∂x₁=30.74 and ∂f/∂x₂=-20.17, perhaps the intended answer is option G, despite the discrepancy in the first two components. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the function's interpretation.

The problem involves evaluating the gradient of the scalar field \( f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = 2 \sin x_1 - x_1^2 x_2 x_3 + x_1 e^{x_2} \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \) at the point \( (2, 3, 5) \). The gradient \( \nabla f \) is computed by finding the partial derivatives with respect to \( x_1 \), \( x_2 \), and \( x_3 \).

1. **Partial Derivative with respect to \( x_1 \):**
   \[
   \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1} = 2 \cos x_1 - 2x_1 x_2 x_3 + 2 e^{x_2}
   \]
   Substituting \( x_1 = 2 \), \( x_2 = 3 \), \( x_3 = 5 \):
   \[
   \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1} = 2 \cos(2) - 2(2)(3)(5) + 2 e^3 \approx -20.66
   \]

2. **Partial Derivative with respect to \( x_2 \):**
   \[
   \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2} = -x_1^2 x_3 + 2x_1 e^{x_2}
   \]
   Substituting \( x_1 = 2 \), \( x_2 = 3 \), \( x_3 = 5 \):
   \[
   \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2} = -4(5) + 2(2)e^3 \approx 60.34
   \]

3. **Partial Derivative with respect to \( x_3 \):**
   \[
   \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_3} = -x_1^2 x_2
   \]
   Substituting \( x_1 = 2 \), \( x_2 = 3 \), \( x_3 = 5 \):
   \[
   \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_3} = -4(3) = -12
   \]

The computed gradient is approximately \( (-20.66, 60.34, -12) \). However, none of the provided options match this result exactly. The closest option with the correct third component \( -12 \) is **G: (30.74, -20.17, -12)**, assuming a potential discrepancy in the first two components.

**Answer: G**
