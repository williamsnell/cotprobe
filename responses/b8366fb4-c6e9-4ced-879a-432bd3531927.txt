Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The question says: An electric iron with a resistance of 24 ohms is connected to a 120-volt line. What power is being used? Then there are several options from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that power in electrical terms can be calculated using different formulas. Oh right, the basic ones are P = V * I, P = I² * R, and P = V² / R. Since I have both voltage and resistance here, maybe the last formula would work best because I don't need to calculate current first unless I want to.

Wait, let me think. The electric iron has a resistance (R) of 24 ohms, and it's connected to 120 volts. So I can plug these values into the formula. The formula P equals V squared divided by R. Yeah, that makes sense because both V and R are given.

So, plugging in the numbers: V is 120 volts, so 120 squared is 120 times 120. Let me calculate that. 120 times 100 is 12,000, and 120 times 20 is 2,400. Adding those together gives 14,400. So V squared is 14,400.

Now, R is 24 ohms. So I divide 14,400 by 24. Let me do that division. Hmm, 24 times 600 is 14,400 because 24 times 6 is 144, so 600 times that would be 14,400. So 14,400 divided by 24 equals 600. That means the power is 600 watts.

Wait a second, let me double-check because sometimes I might mix up the formulas. Alternatively, I could calculate the current first using Ohm's law, which is I = V/R. So I is 120 divided by 24, which is 5 amps. Then, using P = V * I, that would be 120 volts times 5 amps, which is 600 watts as well. So both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.

Looking at the options, option A is 600 watts. So that must be the correct answer. I think I'm confident with that.

To determine the power used by the electric iron, we can use the formula \( P = \frac{V^2}{R} \), where \( V \) is the voltage and \( R \) is the resistance. 

Given:
- \( V = 120 \) volts
- \( R = 24 \) ohms

First, calculate \( V^2 \):
\[
V^2 = 120^2 = 14,400
\]

Next, divide by \( R \):
\[
P = \frac{14,400}{24} = 600 \text{ watts}
\]

This matches option A.
