Okay, so I need to figure out which of the given options is an example of an implied power of the Congress. I'm a bit rusty on my US Constitution, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that implied powers are those that aren't explicitly stated in the Constitution but are necessary to carry out the functions of the government. They are often derived from the expressed powers. So, I should look for something that Congress does that's not directly mentioned but is inferred from other clauses.

Looking at the options:

A: Regulation of interstate commerce – I think this is an enumerated power, specifically in Article I, Section 8. So it's not implied.

B: Power to create federal laws – Wait, isn't that a basic function of Congress? They have the express power to make laws, so this might be an expressed power, not implied.

C: Power to impeach the President – That's in the Constitution, Article I, Section 2. So that's an expressed power.

D: Borrowing money on the credit of the United States – Also in Article I, Section 8. So that's an expressed power too.

E: Declarations of war – Article I, Section 8, so that's expressed.

F: Power to impose an income tax – Hmm, the Constitution allows Congress to levy taxes, but I think the income tax was upheld under the commerce clause, which is an implied power. Wait, no, the income tax is actually an expressed power because the Constitution does mention taxing for the general welfare. But wait, the 16th Amendment explicitly allows for income taxes, so maybe that's not an implied power either.

G: Oversight of executive branch agencies – I think this falls under the oversight or checking function. Congress has the power to investigate and oversee the executive branch, which is an implied power because it's necessary to prevent abuse of power. I'm pretty sure this is an implied power, not something explicitly listed.

H: Power to regulate immigration – I'm not sure. I think regulating immigration is under the power to establish a uniform rule of naturalization, which is an expressed power. Or maybe it's more about controlling borders, which could be implied through other clauses like the necessary and proper clause.

I: Power to approve presidential nominations – That's part of the advice and consent role, which is in the Constitution, so that's expressed.

So, reviewing, options A, B, C, D, E, I are all expressed powers. F is maybe a bit tricky, but I think it's expressed via the tax clause. So the implied power would be G, oversight of executive branch agencies. That makes sense because while the Constitution doesn't explicitly say Congress can oversight, it's necessary for their function, especially the checks and balances.

The correct answer is G: oversight of executive branch agencies, as it is an implied power necessary for Congress to perform its functions effectively.

Answer: G
