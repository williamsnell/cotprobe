Okay, so I have this question about a bias in decision making, and the term is referred to as the 'rule of thumb' type of bias. I need to figure out which option from A to J is correct.

First, let me recall what each of these terms mean. The question is asking about a 'rule of thumb' bias, which I think refers to using simple, heuristic-based decision-making. Heuristics are like mental shortcuts that people use to make decisions quickly, often based on past experiences or general rules. So the term itself might be 'heuristics.'

Looking at the options, option J is 'Heuristics.' That seems to fit because using a rule of thumb is exactly what heuristics are about. But let me make sure by going through the other options.

A: Framing bias. That's when the way information is presented affects the decision. Not exactly the rule of thumb itself but how it's framed.

B: Availability bias. This is when decisions are based on how easily examples come to mind. Like if you remember a lot of shark attacks, you might overestimate the danger.

C: Representativeness bias. This is about how we judge the likelihood of an event based on how similar it is to a prototype, ignoring statistical norms.

D: Self-serving bias. This is when people attribute their successes to internal factors and failures to external factors, which is more about self-justification.

E: Hindsight bias. This is the tendency to think that events were more predictable than they actually were after they've occurred.

F: Over-confidence bias. This is when people are more confident than they should be in their decisions, often because of overestimating their abilities.

G: Confirmation bias. This is about favoring information that confirms existing beliefs, leading to selective perception.

H: Optimism bias. This is the tendency to be overly optimistic about the likelihood of positive outcomes and underestimate negative ones.

I: Anchoring bias. This is when decisions are unduly influenced by the first piece of information encountered (the anchor), often leading to poor decisions.

So, none of these except J (Heuristics) directly relate to using rules of thumb or mental shortcuts. Heuristics encompass various strategies like the rule of thumb, so the correct answer should be J.
