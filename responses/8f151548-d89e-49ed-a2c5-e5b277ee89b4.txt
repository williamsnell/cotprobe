Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a study by Sprecher, Barbee, and Schwartz from 1995. The question is asking what women were more likely to feel than men after their first act of intercourse. The options are A through J, with various emotions listed.

First, I need to think about what I remember from studies on this topic. I recall that there has been research comparing how men and women feel after their first sexual experience. I think it's often discussed in terms of satisfaction and emotions involved.

The study mentioned here, Sprecher et al. (1995), I believe focused on the differences in sexual experiences between genders. From what I remember, they found that women were more likely to experience certain emotions after their first intercourse.

Looking at the options, I see choices like relief, excitement, disappointment, regret, confusion, fear, gladness, guilt, shame, and indifference. I need to think which of these aligns with what women might feel more than men.

I think about the concept of "buyer's remorse" sometimes discussed in relation to first-time sexual experiences. That might be linked to regret or disappointment. Alternatively, some studies suggest that women might feel more anxiety or guilt due to cultural expectations or personal beliefs.

Wait, the question is about what women were more likely to have. So, were they more likely to feel regret, guilt, shame, or perhaps something else?

I'm trying to remember if it was regret or guilt. Alternatively, maybe it's disappointment because they might have expected something different.

Another angle: sometimes studies show that women are more likely to experience negative emotions if their first experience wasn't positive. So, perhaps they felt more regret or disappointment.

I think I've read that women are more likely to feel regret after their first intercourse compared to men. Men might feel more excitement or satisfaction, while women could feel more negative emotions.

So looking at the options, D is experienced regret. That seems to fit. But I should double-check my memory. Alternatively, maybe it's guilt or shame. But I think regret is the more common finding in such studies.

Wait, let me think again. The study by Sprecher and colleagues, I believe, found that women were more likely to feel regret. So the answer would be D: experienced regret.

The study by Sprecher, Barbee, and Schwartz (1995) found that women were more likely than men to experience regret following their first act of intercourse. This aligns with the concept of "buyer's remorse" and the tendency for women to feel more negative emotions if their first sexual experience was not positive.

Answer: D
