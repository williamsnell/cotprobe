Okay, so I have this question about the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, and I need to figure out which statement is correct. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) is related to unemployment taxes. I think it's a federal law that sets up how unemployment taxes are collected, but I'm not entirely sure about the details. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: The unemployment insurance system is administered by the states through their employment laws. Hmm, I think that's right. I remember that while FUTA is federal, the actual administration is done by the states. Each state has its own unemployment system, so A might be correct.

Option B: The Act is intended to provide financial assistance to unemployed workers who have been laid off due to seasonal changes in demand. Seasonal layoffs... I'm not sure. I think unemployment benefits are more general, not just for seasonal changes. Maybe B is inaccurate because FUTA covers various types of unemployment, not just seasonal.

Option C: An employee who resigns regardless of cause is eligible for unemployment benefits. Wait, no, I think if someone quits their job voluntarily, they usually aren't eligible unless there's a good cause, like unsafe working conditions. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D: An employee who is fired for cause is eligible for unemployment benefits. If someone is fired for cause, meaning they did something wrong, they might not be eligible. I think eligibility depends on whether the termination was for cause or not. So D is likely wrong.

Option E: The Act is intended to assist workers who are permanently out of work and need assistance in supporting themselves. That sounds more like the purpose of unemployment insurance. FUTA funds the system, so E could be correct, but I'm not sure if it's the main purpose of the Act itself or just the benefits.

Option F: The Act mandates that employers provide health insurance to employees who are unemployed. No, I don't think FUTA deals with health insurance. That's probably handled by other laws like COBRA or the Affordable Care Act. So F is incorrect.

Option G: The federal unemployment system is funded solely by employee taxes. I don't think so. I remember that both employers and employees contribute to the unemployment taxes. So G is wrong.

Option H: The federal unemployment system is funded by both employer and employee taxes. Yes, I think that's correct. Employers pay FUTA taxes, and states often have their own unemployment taxes where part is withheld from employees. So H might be correct.

Option I: The Act also covers compensation for self-employed individuals. No, I believe unemployment benefits are for employees who lose their jobs, not for self-employed individuals. So I is incorrect.

Option J: The Act is enforced by the Federal Labor Relations Authority. I'm not sure, but I think the Federal Labor Relations Authority deals with labor unions and collective bargaining, not unemployment taxes. So J is probably wrong.

Now, let's evaluate the options. A seems correct about state administration, H about funding sources. The question is which statement is correct regarding FUTA.

Wait, FUTA is the federal law that establishes the tax, but the actual administration is by the states. So A is correct in that sense. But looking at the options, both A and H could be correct, but the question is which statement is correct. Let me see.

Looking back, the question is about which statement is correct regarding FUTA. So, H says the system is funded by both employer and employee taxes. I think that's right because FUTA is the employer's tax, but states also have their own unemployment taxes which may include employee contributions.

But wait, FUTA is solely the employer's tax, right? Or does it include both? I'm a bit confused. Let me think. FUTA is a federal tax on employers, but states have their own programs. Some states have state unemployment taxes where both employers and employees contribute. So the federal system is funded by employers, but the state systems may include employee taxes. So H might be incorrect because the federal system is solely employer-funded, but the state systems add employee contributions. So the statement H says the federal system is funded by both, which is not correct. So H is wrong.

Wait, no, the question is about the federal unemployment system. So if H is about the federal system, then H is incorrect because federal is only employer taxes. So the correct funding is only from employers for the federal part. But the states have their own taxes which include both.

So which options are correct? Let me go through again.

Option A: Administered by states. Correct.

Option E: Intended to assist workers who are permanently out of work. That's the purpose of unemployment insurance, which is funded by FUTA. So E is correct as the purpose.

Wait, the question is about the statements regarding FUTA. So E is about the purpose, which FUTA's system is intended to do. So E could be correct.

So possible correct answers are A and E.

But let me think about each option again. The question is which statement is correct.

Option A: Correct, states administer it.

Option B: No, not only seasonal.

Option C: No, voluntary resignation usually not eligible.

Option D: No, fired for cause not eligible.

Option E: Correct, the purpose is to help those out of work.

Option H: No, federal system is funded by employers only.

So both A and E could be correct. But looking at the options, the question is which one is correct.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct. So if both A and E are correct, but the options don't have multiple correct answers, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps A is correct because FUTA establishes the system, but the states administer it. So A is correct.

Alternatively, E is correct in terms of the purpose.

Wait, the question is about the Act. The Act is FUTA, which is about taxation. The purpose of FUTA is to provide funds for unemployment benefits. So E is describing the purpose of the unemployment insurance system, which FUTA supports. So E is correct.

So now I'm confused because I thought A was correct, but E might also be correct.

Wait, let me check: The Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) is a federal law that imposes a tax on employers to provide funds for state unemployment compensation programs. The states administer these programs, so A is correct.

E says the Act is intended to assist workers who are permanently out of work. That's the purpose of the unemployment benefits, which FUTA funds. So E is also correct in that sense.

But the question is which statement is correct regarding FUTA. So perhaps both A and E are correct, but looking at the options, only one can be the answer.

Wait, perhaps E is correct because it's about the purpose, while A is correct about administration. But the question is about statements regarding FUTA, so both could be correct.

Wait, the question is multiple-choice with options A-J, and only one correct answer.

Let me think again.

Option A: Administered by states. Yes, correct.

Option E: Act intended to assist workers. Correct.

So which is the correct answer? The question is which statement is correct.

Wait, perhaps both A and E are correct, but the options don't allow for that. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are from A to J, and the user says to select the correct one.

I think both A and E are correct, but perhaps the intended answer is A. Alternatively, perhaps E is correct.

Wait, the question is about the Act, FUTA. So FUTA's purpose is to provide funds for unemployment insurance, which helps workers. So E is correct.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about each option.

Another approach: look for incorrect statements.

Option B: seasonal changes. I think FUTA covers all types of unemployment, not just seasonal.

Option C: resign regardless of cause. No, you need to be involuntarily unemployed.

Option D: fired for cause. No, you can't collect if fired for cause.

Option F: health insurance. No.

Option G: funded solely by employees. No, FUTA is employer-funded.

Option H: funded by both. No, FUTA is employer only; states may have their own taxes.

Option I: self-employed. No.

Option J: enforced by FLRA. No.

So incorrect options are B, C, D, F, G, I, J.

Now between A, E, and H.

But H is about funding, and FUTA is employer-funded. So H is incorrect.

So left with A and E.

Which is correct? The question is about the statements regarding FUTA.

A says the system is administered by the states, which is correct.

E says the Act is intended to assist workers who are permanently out of work. That's the purpose of the unemployment system, which FUTA supports. So E is correct.

So both A and E are correct statements about FUTA.

But looking back, the question is which statement is correct. So perhaps both A and E are correct, but the options may have only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A, because FUTA establishes the tax, but the states administer the program. So A is correct.

Alternatively, the question might consider E as correct because it's about the purpose of the Act.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think of FUTA's main points.

FUTA imposes a tax on employers, which goes to the state unemployment funds. The states run the unemployment programs, determining eligibility and benefits. So A is correct.

The purpose of FUTA is to provide funds to states for unemployment benefits, which in turn assist workers who are unemployed. So E is correct.

So both A and E are correct statements. But the options don't have both as correct. So perhaps the intended answer is A.

Alternatively, the question might have only one correct answer, which is A.

Wait, perhaps E is incorrect because FUTA doesn't specifically target those who are permanently out of work; it's for those temporarily unemployed. But I'm not sure.

No, actually, unemployment benefits are for people who are out of work, whether temporary or permanent, but the system is designed to assist them. So E is correct.

I'm a bit confused, but I think both A and E are correct. However, since the question asks for the correct statement, perhaps the intended answer is A, as FUTA is about the tax, and A is about administration.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is A and E.

Wait, the options are A through J, and the user says to select one letter.

I think the correct answers are A and E, but perhaps the intended answer is A.

Wait, looking again, the question is about the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, which is about the tax. So A is correct because it's about administration, which is part of the Act.

Alternatively, E is about the purpose, which is also correct.

Hmm, perhaps the question is designed so that both A and E are correct, but the options may have only one correct. Since the user says to select one, I'll have to choose the most accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of each option again.

The correct statements are:

A: Correct, states administer.

E: Correct, purpose is to assist unemployed workers.

H: Incorrect, federal is employer only.

So the possible correct answers are A and E.

But the question is which statement is correct, so perhaps both are correct, but the options may have only one. Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed with only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is A, as it's a fact about the administration, while E is more about the purpose, which might be covered by state laws, not FUTA directly.

Alternatively, the question's correct answer is A.

But I'm not entirely sure. I think I'll go with A as the correct answer.
</think>

The Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) is a federal law that imposes taxes on employers to fund state unemployment compensation programs. The states are responsible for administering these programs, making Option A correct. Additionally, the purpose of the Act is to provide financial assistance to unemployed workers, making Option E also correct. However, since the question asks for the correct statement regarding FUTA, and considering the focus on the administration aspect, the most accurate answer is:

**Answer: A**
