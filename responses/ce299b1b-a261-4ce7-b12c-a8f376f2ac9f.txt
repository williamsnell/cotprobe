Question:

A mail clerk domiciled in State A slipped and fell on ice that had formed near the loading dock of the building in State B where the clerk's State B employer leased space for its headquarters. The building was owned and operated by a State C corporation. As a result of the fall, the clerk was injured and the employer's expensive computer he was carrying was badly damaged. The clerk sued the building owner for negligence in a federal district court in State B, seeking $100,000 in personal-injury damages. The employer has filed a timely motion to intervene, asserting an $80,000 negligence claim against the building owner for the damage to its computer. Is the court likely to grant the employer's motion to intervene?

Options:

A: No, because the employer cannot intervene in a personal injury case.
B: No, because the employer's claim is not directly related to the clerk's personal injury claim.
C: Yes, because the employer also has a direct negligence claim against the building owner.
D: No, because although the employer has an interest in the clerk's action, that interest is not likely to be impaired in the employer's absence.
E: No, because the employer's claim exceeds the amount the clerk is seeking in damages.
F: Yes, because the employer is an indispensable party.
G: Yes, because the employer's claim shares common questions of law and fact with the clerk's action.
H: No, because the clerk chose not to join the employer as a co-plaintiff in his action.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the employer can intervene in this lawsuit. Let me start by breaking down the scenario.

The clerk, who's from State A, slipped and fell on ice at a loading dock in State B. The employer is based in State B and leased space there. The building is owned by a State C corporation. The clerk is suing the building owner for negligence, asking for $100k for his injuries. Now, the employer wants to intervene because their computer was damaged and they're claiming $80k in negligence.

I remember that intervention in a lawsuit usually depends on certain legal criteria. The main idea is whether the intervenor has a right to join the case, typically as someone who is affected by the outcome.

First, the clerk is suing for personal injuries, and the employer is suing for property damage—the computer. So the employer's claim is separate but related. They both are suing the same defendant, the building owner. So maybe there's a common defendant here.

I think about the rules for intervention. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a) allows a person to intervene as a matter of right if they claim an interest in the action and are so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede their ability to protect that interest. Alternatively, the court can permit intervention on timely application when the motion is based on a claim or defense and the applicant's interest is not adequately represented by existing parties.

In this case, the employer's interest is in recovering for the computer damage. Since the clerk's claim is for personal injury, and the employer's is for property damage, they are both suing the same defendant but for different damages. So the employer's interest might not be directly tied to the clerk's claim, but they both are against the same defendant.

Wait, but the employer is a separate entity. The clerk is an employee, but the employer's claim is their own. So if the building owner is found liable, the clerk gets some money, and the employer could get theirs too. But if the clerk's case is dismissed or settles for less, it might not affect the employer's claim. Or does it? Hmm.

Intervention as a matter of right requires that the applicant's interest is separate and distinct, and that their interest could be affected by the outcome. Here, the employer's claim is separate; the clerk's case doesn't directly impact the employer's ability to recover for the computer. So the employer's interest isn't being impaired by the clerk's case. Therefore, they might not have a right to intervene as a matter of right.

Alternatively, the court could allow permissive intervention if their claims share common questions of law or fact. Both cases involve the same defendant and the same incident. So there might be common issues, like whether the building owner was negligent in clearing the ice.

But the key point is whether the employer's interest is being impaired. Since the clerk's claim is about personal injury and the employer's is about property damage, the employer's interest isn't directly affected by the clerk's case. The employer can pursue their own claim separately.

Looking at the options:

Option B says no because the employer's claim isn't directly related. But I think their claims are related because they arise from the same incident, so maybe B isn't correct.

Option D says no because the employer's interest isn't likely to be impaired. That seems plausible because the employer's claim is separate; the clerk's case doesn't directly affect the employer's ability to recover.

Wait, but the employer's claim could be affected if the clerk's case sets a precedent or if the defendant's liability is determined in a way that affects the employer's case. But legally, for intervention, the focus is on whether the outcome directly impairs the interest. So if the employer's claim is separate, their interest is not impaired. Therefore, the court is unlikely to grant intervention as a matter of right.

Another angle: the employer is a third party who's not a party to the original contract or tort, but they're suing the same defendant. But the clerk is suing for his own injuries, and the employer for their property. Since the employer's claim is separate, they might not need to intervene. They can file their own lawsuit if they wish, but in this scenario, they're trying to join the existing case.

So the correct answer might be D: No, because the employer's interest isn't likely to be impaired if they don't intervene. Alternatively, maybe G: Yes, because the claims share common issues. But intervention is more about whether their interest is affected, not just common issues.

Wait, but permissive intervention under Rule 24(b) allows for intervention if the motion is timely and the applicant's claim or defense has a question of law or fact in common with the main action, and if the applicant's interest is not adequately represented. Here, the employer's claim does share common issues. So maybe the court would allow permissive intervention because the claims share common questions.

But the question is whether the court is "likely" to grant the motion. If they can argue that their claim is separate but related, they might be allowed in as a permissive intervenor.

Wait, but the clerk is suing for $100k, and the employer is claiming $80k. The employer's claim is less than the clerk's, but it's still a separate claim. So the employer's interest is in getting their own damages, which isn't directly tied to the clerk's personal injury.

I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The employer's interest is not being impaired because the clerk's case doesn't affect their ability to sue separately. So the employer could file their own lawsuit against the building owner. Therefore, their interest isn't impaired in the clerk's action because they can pursue their own case independently.

So the correct answer would be D: No, because the employer's interest isn't likely to be impaired. Or perhaps H: No, because the clerk didn't join the employer as a co-plaintiff.

Wait, H says the clerk didn't join the employer, but the employer is moving to intervene, not to be a co-plaintiff. So H might not be the right choice.

Alternatively, looking at the options:

Option G says yes because the claims share common questions. That's a possibility because they both involve the same defendant and the same incident. So the court might find that permissive intervention is appropriate because of the common issues.

But the employer's motion is timely, and their claim is based on the same tortious conduct. So perhaps the court would allow permissive intervention.

Wait, but the clerk's claim is personal injury, and the employer's is property damage. They are separate causes of action but against the same defendant. So the employer's claim is separate, but the negligence issues might overlap—like whether the building owner was negligent in maintaining the premises.

So the court might find that there are common questions and allow permissive intervention under Rule 24(b). Therefore, the correct answer would be G: Yes, because the employer's claim shares common questions of law and fact with the clerk's action.

But I'm not sure if that's the primary reason. Alternatively, the employer's interest isn't being impaired, so they don't need to intervene as a matter of right. But if they can join for common issues, they might be allowed permissive intervention.

Wait, the question is whether the motion is likely to be granted. The clerk is suing for personal injury, and the employer wants to sue for property damage. So the employer's motion is timely, and their claim is based on the same act of negligence. So the court could allow permissive intervention because their claims are related.

Looking at the options again, option G says yes because of common questions. That seems correct.

But I'm a bit torn between D and G. D says the employer's interest isn't impaired, so they don't need to intervene. But G is about permissive intervention based on common questions.

In federal courts, permissive intervention is more common, but the employer would have to show that their claim has a question of law or fact in common. Since both claims arise from the same incident, there are definitely common issues. So the court is likely to grant permissive intervention, making G the correct answer.

The employer's motion to intervene is likely to be granted because their claim shares common questions of law and fact with the clerk's action, as both arise from the same incident involving the building owner's alleged negligence. 

Answer: G
