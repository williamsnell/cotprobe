Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Describe briefly the characteristics of the ontogeny of a humanbeing from a zygote to a mature fetus. What is the significanceof this?

Options:

A: Ontogeny refers to the development of social behaviors in humans from infancy to adulthood.
B: Ontogeny is the study of morphological changes of an organism throughout its lifespan.
C: The ontogeny of a human begins with the birth and ends with the onset of puberty.
D: Ontogeny is the sequence of events involved in the evolutionary development of a species over time.
E: Ontogeny represents the individual development of an organism.
F: The ontogeny of the human embryo reveals to some extent the evolutionary history of man. The significance of this is that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.
G: Ontogeny describes the genetic control of cell growth.
H: Ontogeny involves the maturation of the immune system from birth to the aging process.
I: The ontogeny of a human being starts at adolescence and continues until the individual reaches full emotional and intellectual maturity.
J: Ontogeny is the process of an individual organism growing organically.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about ontogeny and the characteristics of a human's development from a zygote to a mature fetus. I need to figure out the correct answer by understanding each option.

First, I remember that ontogeny refers to the development of an individual organism from its earliest stages, like a fertilized egg, through to maturity. So the question is asking about the process from zygote to fetus and why that's significant.

Looking at the options:

Option A talks about social behaviors from infancy to adulthood. That doesn't sound right because social behaviors are more about psychology and environment, not the biological development from zygote.

Option B says it's about morphological changes throughout lifespan. Morphological changes are about physical form, but does it cover the whole lifespan? I think ontogeny includes more than just physical changes, but maybe this is close.

Option C claims ontogeny starts at birth and ends at puberty. No, that's incorrect because ontogeny starts way before birth, with the zygote. So C is wrong.

Option D is about evolutionary development over time for a species. That sounds more like phylogeny, which is the study of the evolution of species, not individual development. So D is probably wrong.

Option E says ontogeny is individual development. That makes sense because ontogeny is the study of an individual's development, not the species as a whole. So E is a good candidate.

Option F mentions that ontogeny reveals evolutionary history and that it recapitulates phylogeny. I recall something about recapitulation theory, where ontogeny repeats phylogeny. So F is also a contender.

Option G talks about genetic control of cell growth. That's more about the mechanisms of development, not the overall process of becoming a mature fetus. So G might not be the best fit.

Option H is about the immune system maturation from birth to aging. That's too narrow and focuses only on a part, not the whole ontogeny.

Option I starts at adolescence, which is way too late. Ontogeny starts much earlier, so I is wrong.

Option J says it's the process of an organism growing organically. That seems a bit vague, but it's a general statement about growth.

So, the question is about the characteristics of ontogeny from zygote to fetus and its significance. The options E and F are both relevant. E defines ontogeny correctly as individual development, but F adds the significance about recapitulating phylogeny, which is an important concept.

The question asks for both the characteristics and the significance. So the correct answer should include both aspects. Option F talks about the significance (evolutionary history and recapitulation), while E is just a definition without the significance part.

Therefore, the best answer is F.

The correct answer is F. It accurately describes ontogeny as the developmental process from a zygote to a mature fetus and highlights its significance in reflecting evolutionary history through recapitulation of phylogeny.

F
