Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy levels of sodium. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. The question says that the first line of the principal series of sodium is the "D" line at 5890 Angstroms. That corresponds to a transition from the first excited state, which is 3p, to the ground state, 3s. I need to find the energy of the first excited state in electron volts.

Alright, first I remember that when an electron transitions between energy levels, the energy of the emitted photon corresponds to the difference between those levels. The energy of the photon can be found using the equation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength of the emitted light.

Wait, but wait, sodium's D line is a well-known doublet, D1 and D2, which are close together but I think the question refers to the main D line, probably D2 at 5890 Å. So I'll go with that wavelength.

So, let me note down the values I need. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. The speed of light c is about 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 5890 Å, which is 5890 x 10^-10 meters, since 1 Å is 1e-10 m. Oh wait, no, 1 Å is 1e-10 m, so 5890 Å is 5890e-10 m, which is 5.89e-7 meters. Wait, that seems right.

So plug these into E = hc/λ. Let me compute that.

E = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3.0e8 m/s) / (5890e-10 m)

Wait, let me compute the numerator first: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Then the denominator is 5890e-10 m, which is 5.89e-7 m.

So E = 1.9878e-25 J·m / 5.89e-7 m. Let me calculate that.

Dividing 1.9878e-25 by 5.89e-7 gives me approximately 3.378e-19 J per photon.

Now, I need to convert this energy from joules to electron volts. I remember that 1 eV is equal to 1.602e-19 joules. So to get the energy in eV, I'll divide the energy in joules by 1.602e-19.

So E (eV) = 3.378e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.108 eV.

Wait, that's about 2.108 eV. But wait, this is the energy of the photon emitted when the electron transitions from the excited state (3p) to the ground state (3s). So the energy of the photon is the difference between these two levels. That is, E_photon = E_upper - E_lower.

Wait, but wait, the ground state is lower in energy, so the excited state must be higher. So the photon's energy is E_upper (3p) minus E_ground (3s). So E_photon = E_3p - E_3s.

Wait, but in this problem, I think the ground state is 3s, and the first excited state is 3p. So the transition is from 3p to 3s, emitting a photon with energy E_photon = E_3p - E_3s.

I need to find E_3p, which is the energy of the first excited state. So E_3p = E_photon + E_3s.

But wait, what's E_3s? That's the ground state energy. I think for multi-electron atoms, the energy levels are calculated using the Rydberg formula, but maybe I can use the ionization energy approach.

Wait, the ground state of sodium is the 3s orbital. The energy of the 3s orbital can be found using the Rydberg formula for hydrogen-like atoms. Sodium has 11 electrons, but since it's in the third period, maybe the 3s is the outermost shell. Wait, the Rydberg formula for hydrogen is 13.6 eV for the ground state (n=1), but for other atoms, it's scaled by the atomic number and the electron configuration.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The energy levels in hydrogen are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n². For sodium, which is an alkali metal with atomic number 11, the 3s orbital would have an energy that's higher (less negative) than hydrogen's because of the screening effect. Hmm, but perhaps the problem expects me to treat sodium as a hydrogen-like ion, which is an approximation. So for a hydrogen-like atom, the energy levels are given by E_n = - (Z² * 13.6 eV) / n², where Z is the atomic number.

Wait, sodium has Z=11, so E_n for n=3 would be E_3 = - (11² * 13.6 eV) / 3². Let me calculate that.

11 squared is 121. 121 * 13.6 = let's compute that: 120*13.6=1632, plus 1*13.6 gives 1645.6. So 1645.6 / 9 = approximately 182.844 eV. So E_3 would be -182.844 eV. Wait, but that seems way too high. Hmm, perhaps that approach isn't correct because sodium isn't a hydrogen-like ion, but a multi-electron atom, so the energy levels are lower in energy (more negative) than hydrogen's. Wait, but that can't be right because in reality, the 3s orbital of sodium is higher than hydrogen's 1s. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that the energy of the transition is the difference between the 3p and 3s levels. So the photon emitted has energy E_photon = E_3p - E_3s. We calculated E_photon as about 2.108 eV.

So, E_3p = E_photon + E_3s.

But what is E_3s? If I can find E_3s, then I can find E_3p.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the energy of the 3s level relative to the ground state. Wait, but I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should think about the ionization energy. The ground state of sodium is 3s, and the ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from that state. For sodium, the ionization energy is about 5.1 eV. Hmm, but wait, that's the energy to remove the 3s electron. So E_3s would be -5.1 eV relative to the vacuum level, I think.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, the energy levels for alkali metals can be approximated using the formula for hydrogen-like atoms, but considering the screening effect. So for sodium (Z=11), the 3s orbital's energy would be lower in energy (more negative) than hydrogen's. Wait, but perhaps that's not the right approach either.

Wait, maybe I should use the fact that the energy levels are given by E_n = -13.6 eV * (Z_eff)^2 / n², where Z_eff is the effective nuclear charge. For sodium, the 3s electrons would have Z_eff = Z - σ, where σ is the screening constant. I think for the 3s orbital in sodium, σ is 2. So Z_eff would be 11 - 2 = 9. So E_3s = -13.6 * (9)^2 / (3)^2 = -13.6 * 81 / 9 = -13.6 * 9 = -122.4 eV. Hmm, but that seems way too low because that would make the photon energy we calculated earlier (2.1 eV) much smaller in comparison. But I'm not sure if this is the correct approach because sodium isn't hydrogen-like, and the approximation might not hold.

Wait, perhaps I'm making it more complicated than needed. Let me step back. The problem states that the transition is from 3p to 3s, and the photon emitted has energy E_photon = 2.108 eV. So E_photon = E_3p - E_3s. I need to find E_3p, which is the energy of the first excited state.

But I don't know E_3s. Alternatively, perhaps the ground state energy of sodium is known. Wait, the ground state of sodium is the 3s orbital, and the first ionization energy is about 5.1 eV, which is the energy required to remove the 3s electron. So the energy of the 3s level is approximately -5.1 eV if we take the vacuum level as zero. So E_3s = -5.1 eV. Therefore, E_3p = E_photon + E_3s = 2.108 eV + (-5.1 eV) = -2.992 eV? That can't be right because the 3p level should be higher in energy than 3s, so E_3p should be less negative than E_3s.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. If E_3s is -5.1 eV, and E_photon is +2.108 eV, then E_3p = E_photon + E_3s = 2.108 -5.1 = -2.992 eV. But that would imply that 3p is higher (less negative) than 3s, which is correct because 3p is higher than 3s. So that would mean E_3p is -2.992 eV. But wait, that can't be right because the first excited state is 3p, so its energy should be higher than 3s, which is correct.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the energy of the first excited state (3p), so that would be E_3p = E_photon + E_3s. If E_3s is -5.1 eV, then E_3p = 2.108 + (-5.1) = -2.992 eV. But wait, that would make the 3p level higher than 3s, which is correct. However, the options given are all positive, which doesn't make sense because energy levels are negative relative to the vacuum level. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. Maybe the energy levels are given as positive values, and the transition energy is the difference between the two. Let me try that approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the energy levels with their absolute values. Alternatively, perhaps the energy of the 3s level is lower than the 3p, and the photon emitted has energy equal to the difference between them.

Wait, let me try another approach. The energy levels for sodium can be found using the Rydberg formula for multi-electron atoms. The Rydberg constant is approximately 13.6 eV. For the principal series (which is the series where electrons transition to the ground state), the transition is from a higher energy level to the ground state. The D line corresponds to a transition from the 3p level to the 3s ground state.

The general Rydberg formula for the principal series is 1/λ = R * Z² (1/n₁² - 1/n₂²), where n₁ is the principal quantum number of the ground state (n₁=3 for 3s), and n₂ is the principal quantum number of the excited state (n₂=3 for 3p as well, but different l value). Wait, but for the same n, how does that work? Because 3s and 3p have the same n, but different l. So perhaps I need to consider the fine structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy levels for 3p and 3s can be approximated using the hydrogen model with some adjustment for Z.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula for the energy levels in hydrogen and adjust for the atomic number. For hydrogen, E_n = -13.6 eV / n². For sodium (Z=11), the energy levels would be E_n = -13.6 * (Z²) / n². So E_3s would be -13.6 * (11)^2 / 3². Let's calculate that.

11 squared is 121, so 121 * 13.6 = 1645.6. Divided by 9, that's 182.844. So E_3s = -182.844 eV. Similarly, E_3p would be the same because for hydrogen-like atoms, the energy depends only on n, not l. So E_3p is also -182.844 eV. Then the transition from 3p to 3s would have energy E_photon = E_3p - E_3s. But wait, that would be zero because they're the same energy, which isn't correct. So that approach must be wrong because in reality, 3p and 3s have slightly different energies due to the different l values.

Hmm, maybe the fine structure comes into play here. The fine structure correction for hydrogen-like atoms depends on the quantum numbers n and l. The energy shift is given by ΔE = ( ( (l)(l+1) - 3s² ) * ( (Ry) * α² ) ) / (2n³), where α is the fine-structure constant. But this is getting complicated, and perhaps the problem expects a simpler approach.

Wait, maybe I should use the principal quantum number and the fact that the energy difference between 3p and 3s is the photon's energy we calculated earlier. So E_3p - E_3s = 2.108 eV. But without knowing either E_3s or E_3p, I can't directly find E_3p. Unless I can find E_3s from another source.

Wait, perhaps the ground state energy for sodium's 3s orbital is known. Wait, looking it up in my mind, I think the ionization energy of sodium is about 5.1 eV, which is the energy required to remove the 3s electron. So E_3s would be -5.1 eV relative to zero (the vacuum level). So if E_3s is -5.1 eV and E_3p is higher (less negative), then E_3p = E_3s + E_photon. So E_3p = (-5.1 eV) + 2.108 eV = -2.992 eV. But that doesn't match any of the options, which are all positive. So this can't be right.

Wait a second, perhaps I've made a mistake in the sign. If E_3s is lower (more negative) than E_3p, then E_3p is higher. So E_photon = E_3p - E_3s. So if E_3s is -5.1 eV, then E_3p = E_photon + E_3s. So 2.108 eV + (-5.1 eV) = -2.992 eV. That's the energy of E_3p. But the options are all positive, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the reference point.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the energy levels relative to the ground state as zero. But that wouldn't make sense because then the ground state would have zero energy, which isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the energy of the photon is the difference between the two states, and since the excited state is higher, E_3p = E_3s + E_photon. But without knowing E_3s, I can't proceed. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. The energy of the photon is 2.108 eV, which is the energy difference between 3p and 3s. So E_3p = E_3s + 2.108 eV. But if I can find E_3s, I can find E_3p.

Wait, another approach: the ground state of sodium is 3s, and the first excited state is 3p. So the energy of the 3s level is lower than 3p. The ionization energy of sodium is about 5.1 eV, which is the energy needed to remove an electron from the 3s orbital. So the energy of the 3s level is -5.1 eV (if we take the vacuum level as zero). Therefore, the energy of the 3p level would be higher by 2.108 eV, so E_3p = -5.1 + 2.108 = -2.992 eV. But again, the options are all positive, so I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the energy levels are given as positive values, with the ground state at some lower energy. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the energy of the 3p level using the Rydberg formula considering Z. Wait, let's try that.

Using the Rydberg formula for hydrogen-like atoms, E_n = -13.6 eV * (Z²) / n². For sodium, Z=11, n=3.

So E_3 = -13.6 * (11)^2 / 3^2 = -13.6 * 121 / 9 = -13.6 * 13.444 ≈ -182.96 eV.

Wait, that's the energy of the 3s level. The 3p level would be slightly higher because for the same n, higher l values have higher energy. So the energy difference between 3p and 3s would be the fine structure, which is small compared to the overall energy.

The fine structure correction is given by ΔE = ( ( (l)(l+1) - 3s² ) * ( (Ry) * α² ) ) / (2n³), where s is the spin quantum number. But for electrons, s=1/2, so s²=3/4. So for 3s, l=0, and for 3p, l=1.

So for 3s: l=0 → (0)(1) = 0. For 3p: l=1 → (1)(2) = 2.

So the difference in fine structure between 3p and 3s would be ΔE = ( (2 - 0) * ( (13.6 eV) * (1/137)^2 ) ) / (2 * 3^3 )

Let me calculate that.

First, (1/137)^2 ≈ 5.3e-5.

So 13.6 eV * 5.3e-5 ≈ 0.00072 eV.

Multiply by 2: 0.00144 eV.

Divide by (2 * 27) = 54: 0.00144 / 54 ≈ 2.667e-5 eV.

So the fine structure energy difference between 3p and 3s is about 2.67e-5 eV. That's way smaller than the 2.1 eV we calculated earlier for the photon. So this suggests that the main energy difference is due to the transition between these levels, but the fine structure is negligible in this context. Therefore, perhaps the problem expects us to treat the 3p and 3s levels as having the same energy, which isn't correct, but maybe that's the approach.

Wait, but that can't be right because the D line exists due to the splitting between 3p and 3s. So perhaps the problem is using a simplified model where the energy difference is taken as the photon's energy, and the 3s level is at zero. But that doesn't make sense because the ground state can't be at zero energy.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the initial calculation. The photon's energy is 2.108 eV, which is the energy difference between 3p and 3s. So the energy of the 3p level is E_3p = E_3s + 2.108 eV.

But without knowing E_3s, I can't find E_3p. Unless the problem assumes that the 3s level is at a certain energy, perhaps zero, which isn't correct but maybe that's what the problem expects.

Wait, but looking at the options, all are positive, which suggests that the energy is being measured relative to some other point, perhaps the vacuum level. But in reality, energy levels are negative relative to the vacuum level. So perhaps the problem is considering the energy of the 3p level as the transition energy added to the 3s level. But without knowing the 3s level, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the energy of the ground state (3s) is taken as zero, and the excited state (3p) is at +2.108 eV. But that's not correct because the ground state is lower in energy. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the Rydberg formula in a way that the energy of the transition is the energy of the excited state. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe another approach. The Rydberg formula for the principal series is 1/λ = R_H * Z² (1/n₁² - 1/n₂²), where n₁ is the ground state principal quantum number (3), and n₂ is the excited state (but same n, so this would give zero, which isn't helpful). So perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, maybe the transition is from a higher energy level to the ground state, but in this case, it's from 3p to 3s, which are same n but different l. So perhaps the Rydberg formula isn't directly applicable here, and instead, we should use the energy difference calculated from the photon's wavelength.

So, given that, the energy of the 3p level is E_3p = E_3s + E_photon.

But without knowing E_3s, I can't proceed. Unless the problem assumes that the ground state (3s) has zero energy, which isn't correct, but perhaps that's the case.

Wait, but if E_3s is zero, then E_3p would be 2.108 eV. Looking at the options, option A is 2.105 eV, which is very close. So perhaps that's the intended answer.

But wait, that can't be correct because the ground state can't be at zero energy. The ground state is lower in energy than the excited state, so E_3s would be negative, and E_3p would be less negative. So if E_3s is, say, -5.1 eV, and E_3p is -2.992 eV, then the transition energy is 2.108 eV. But the question is asking for the energy of the first excited state, which is E_3p. So if the options are all positive, perhaps the problem is considering the energy relative to the vacuum level as positive, so E_3p would be 2.108 eV, which would make option A correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the approximation that the energy of the 3s level is zero, which would make E_3p = 2.108 eV. That would make option A correct.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident because this approach seems a bit off. Maybe I should just go with the initial calculation where E_photon is 2.108 eV, and since the question asks for the energy of the first excited state, which is 3p, the answer would be 2.108 eV, which rounds to 2.105 eV as option A.
</think>

The problem involves determining the energy of the first excited state (3p) of sodium, given that the transition from 3p to the ground state (3s) emits a photon with a wavelength of 5890 Å (the "D" line). The energy of the photon is calculated using the equation:

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 5890 \, \text{Å} = 5.89 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \). Substituting these values:

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.0 \times 10^8)}{5.89 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 3.378 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
\]

Converting to electron volts using \( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \):

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{3.378 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.108 \, \text{eV}
\]

The energy of the photon corresponds to the difference between the 3p and 3s levels:

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = E_{3p} - E_{3s}
\]

Assuming the ground state (3s) is at a known energy, the first excited state (3p) is higher in energy. However, the problem does not explicitly provide \( E_{3s} \). If the ground state is approximated as \( E_{3s} = 0 \, \text{eV} \) for simplicity, then:

\[
E_{3p} = E_{\text{photon}} = 2.108 \, \text{eV}
\]

This matches closely with option A (\( 2.105 \, \text{eV} \)). Given the options provided and the calculations, the energy of the first excited state is:
