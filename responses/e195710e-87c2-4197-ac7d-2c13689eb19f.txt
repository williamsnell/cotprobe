Okay, so I've got this question about phase-shift keying systems and error probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that a PSK system is suffering from imperfect synchronization and asks us to determine φ such that the error probabilities Pe for PSK and DPSK are both 10^-5. The options are from A to J, each with different degrees.

First, I remember that PSK and DPSK have different error probabilities when there's timing error, which is caused by imperfect synchronization. I think the error probabilities depend on the phase shift φ introduced by this timing error.

Wait, for PSK, the error probability when there's a phase shift φ is given by something like Pe(PSK) = [1 - cos(φ)] / 2. And for DPSK, I think it's Pe(DPSK) = [1 - sin(φ)] / 2. Or maybe I have that backwards. Let me check my notes. Oh, right, no, for PSK, it's [1 - cos(φ)]/2, and for DPSK, it's [1 - sin(φ)]/2. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Hmm, no, I think that's correct because DPSK uses the difference in phase, so maybe sine is involved.

Wait, another thought: the error probabilities for both PSK and DPSK when there's a phase shift φ. So the question is asking when these two error probabilities are equal. So set Pe(PSK) equal to Pe(DPSK) and solve for φ.

So, setting [1 - cos(φ)]/2 = [1 - sin(φ)]/2. Wait, but that would imply that cos φ equals sin φ, which would happen when φ is 45°, but that's not one of the options. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the formulas wrong.

Wait, no, perhaps I mixed up the formulas. Let me think again. I think for PSK with a phase error φ, the bit error rate is (1 - cos φ)/2, and for DPSK, it's (1 - sin φ)/2. Or maybe it's the other way around. Alternatively, perhaps I should recall that the error probabilities depend on the phase shift caused by the timing error, which is φ/2 for some cases. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the expressions again. Oh wait, I can't do that now, so I'll try to reason it out. Let me think about the constellation diagrams. For PSK, the received symbol is rotated by φ, so the error probability is based on the distance between the intended symbol and the rotated one. For binary PSK, it's the probability that the received point is in the wrong region, which depends on cos φ. For DPSK, since it's differentially encoded, the phase shift is relative to the previous symbol, so the error probability might involve sin φ.

Wait, perhaps I should set the two error probabilities equal and solve for φ. So:

(1 - cos φ)/2 = (1 - sin φ)/2.

Multiplying both sides by 2:

1 - cos φ = 1 - sin φ.

Subtract 1 from both sides:

-cos φ = -sin φ.

Multiply both sides by -1:

cos φ = sin φ.

Which occurs at φ = 45°, 225°, etc. But 45° isn't among the options. Wait, the options given are 12°, 15°, 18°, 20°, 22°, 24°, 27°, 30°, 36°, 40°. None are 45°. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I have the formulas wrong.

Wait another thought: perhaps the error probabilities are given by different expressions. Maybe for PSK, it's (1 - cos φ)/2, and for DPSK, it's [1 - cos(φ/2)]/2, or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the error probability for DPSK is [1 - sin(φ)]/2. Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the error probabilities are given by:

Pe(PSK) = (1 - cos φ)/2,

Pe(DPSK) = (1 - sin φ)/2.

Wait, but setting them equal gives cos φ = sin φ, which as I said, is 45°, not in the options. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shift isn't φ but 2φ. Let me think. Wait, in some references, the phase shift due to timing error is 2φ, so maybe the error probabilities involve cos(2φ) and sin(2φ). Let me try that.

So, Pe(PSK) = (1 - cos(2φ))/2,

Pe(DPSK) = (1 - sin(2φ))/2.

Setting them equal:

1 - cos(2φ) = 1 - sin(2φ).

Which simplifies to cos(2φ) = sin(2φ).

Which happens when 2φ = 45°, so φ = 22.5°, which is approximately 22.5°, and looking at the options, option B is 22°, which is close. That must be the answer.

Wait, let me double-check. So if φ is 22.5°, then 2φ is 45°, and cos(45°) = sin(45°), so the error probabilities would be equal. So the closest option is 22°, which is option B.

So the answer should be B: 22°.

The question involves determining the phase shift φ for which the error probabilities of PSK and DPSK systems are equal at 10^-5, considering imperfect synchronization. The error probabilities for PSK and DPSK are given by Pe(PSK) = (1 - cos φ)/2 and Pe(DPSK) = (1 - sin φ)/2. Setting these equal leads to cos φ = sin φ, which occurs at φ = 45°. However, since 45° is not an option, the phase shift is reconsidered as 2φ, leading to cos(2φ) = sin(2φ). This happens at 2φ = 45°, so φ = 22.5°, approximately 22°, which corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
