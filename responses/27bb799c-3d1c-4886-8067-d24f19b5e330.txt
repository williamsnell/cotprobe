Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here about a filling machine and coffee jars. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The problem says that the machine puts an average of four ounces of coffee in each jar, with a standard deviation of 0.25 ounces. So, the population mean (μ) is 4 ounces, and the population standard deviation (σ) is 0.25 ounces. 

Now, they're taking a sample of 40 jars. I need to find the probability that the mean amount per jar in this sample is less than 3.9 ounces. So, the sample size (n) is 40, and the sample mean (x̄) we're interested in is 3.9 ounces. 

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with sample means, especially for large samples, the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) comes into play. The CLT says that the distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normal, regardless of the population distribution, as long as the sample size is large enough. Since 40 is a reasonably large sample, I think this applies here.

So, the first thing I should do is find the standard error of the mean. The standard error (SE) is calculated by dividing the population standard deviation by the square root of the sample size. That's σ/√n. Plugging in the numbers: 0.25 / √40. Let me calculate that. 

The square root of 40 is approximately 6.3246, so 0.25 divided by 6.3246 is roughly 0.0395. So, the standard error is about 0.0395 ounces.

Next, I need to find how many standard errors 3.9 ounces is away from the population mean of 4 ounces. This is the z-score. The formula for the z-score in this context is (x̄ - μ) / SE. So, (3.9 - 4) / 0.0395. 

Calculating the numerator: 3.9 minus 4 is -0.1. Then, -0.1 divided by 0.0395 is approximately -2.53. So, the z-score is about -2.53.

Now, I need to find the probability that the sample mean is less than 3.9 ounces, which corresponds to finding the probability that Z is less than -2.53. In other words, P(Z < -2.53). 

I recall that standard normal distribution tables give the probability that Z is less than a given value. But since this z-score is negative, I might need to find the area to the left of -2.53. Alternatively, I can use symmetry to find the area to the right of 2.53 and then subtract from 1, but wait, actually, no, because we're looking for the lower tail.

Looking up z = 2.53 in the standard normal table, I think the value is around 0.9943, which is the probability that Z is less than 2.53. But since our z is negative, we're looking for the lower tail. So, P(Z < -2.53) is the same as 1 - P(Z < 2.53). 

Wait, no, that's not right. Actually, the standard normal table gives P(Z < z) for positive z. For a negative z, like -2.53, the probability is the same as P(Z > 2.53) because of symmetry. So, P(Z < -2.53) = P(Z > 2.53). 

Since P(Z < 2.53) is approximately 0.9943, then P(Z > 2.53) is 1 - 0.9943 = 0.0057. Therefore, P(Z < -2.53) is also 0.0057. 

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact value of the z-score. Let me double-check the calculation. 

Z = (3.9 - 4) / (0.25 / sqrt(40)) 
= (-0.1) / (0.25 / 6.3246) 
= (-0.1) / 0.0395 
≈ -2.53

Yes, that seems correct. Now, looking up z = 2.53, I think the exact value is 0.9943, so the probability to the right (i.e., for Z > 2.53) is 0.0057, or 0.57%. 

So, the probability that the sample mean is less than 3.9 ounces is approximately 0.0057. Looking at the options, F is 0.0057. So, I think the correct answer is F.

The problem involves calculating the probability that the sample mean is less than 3.9 ounces using the Central Limit Theorem. The z-score is found to be approximately -2.53, leading to a probability of 0.0057.
