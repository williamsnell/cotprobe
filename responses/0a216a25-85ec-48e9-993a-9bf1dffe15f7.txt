Question:

A 3-week-old male infant is brought to the office by his mother because of a 2-day history of white lesions in the mouth. The infant was born at term via uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery; he has been breast-feeding well and is urinating and having bowel movements normally. At birth, he weighed 3289 g (7 lb 4 oz; 30th percentile). Today, he weighs 3629 kg (8 lb; 25th percentile). He appears adequately hydrated. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination discloses white patches on the tongue and buccal mucosa that do not come off when gently scraped with a tongue blade. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?

Options:

A: Fluconazole
B: Valacyclovir
C: Ketoconazole
D: Acyclovir
E: Miconazole
F: Amphotericin B
G: Terbinafine
H: Clotrimazole
I: Nystatin
J: Voriconazole

Okay, so I've got this question here about a 3-week-old baby with white lesions in his mouth. Hmm, I remember that in infants, especially new-borns, there are a few common conditions that present with white patches in the mouth. The most common ones I can think of are thrush, which is a fungal infection, and maybe some viral infections like herpes.

The question says the baby was born at term, no complications, and is breastfeeding well. His weight gain looks okay, so he's probably healthy otherwise. The mother noticed these white patches for two days, and when she tried scraping them with a tongue blade, they didn't come off. That makes me think it's not just milk residue because that usually comes off easily.

So, thinking about thrush first. Thrush is caused by the fungus Candida. It's common in babies because their immune systems are still developing, and they can get it from the mother during birth or from breastfeeding if the nipples are colonized. The patches in thrush are usually curd-like, white, and don't rub off easily. Other signs might include redness around the mouth or being irritable during feeding because it's painful.

Other possibilities could be herpes simplex virus (HSV). Neonatal herpes can present with mouth sores, but usually, they're more vesicular or ulcerative. But sometimes they might look white. However, HSV is more concerning and typically requires antiviral treatment like acyclovir. But in this case, the baby doesn't have other signs like fever or vesicles elsewhere. Plus, the mother didn't mention any history of exposure to HSV.

Looking at the options, fluconazole (A) is an antifungal, often used for yeast infections. Valacyclovir (B) is for herpes, so if it were HSV, that would be the choice. Ketoconazole (C) is another antifungal, but it's not commonly used in infants, I think. Acyclovir (D) is for viruses, same as B. Miconazole (E) is an antifungal, often used topically for yeast infections, like in creams. Amphotericin B (F) is a strong antifungal, but it's usually for more severe cases. Terbinafine (G) is for fungal infections too, but I'm not sure about its use in infants. Clotrimazole (H) is another antifungal, commonly used topically. Nystatin (I) is an antifungal, especially for oral candidiasis, and is often given as a suspension. Voriconazole (J) is a newer antifungal, but I think it's more for serious or resistant fungal infections.

Since thrush is the most likely diagnosis here, the treatment would be an antifungal. Nystatin (I) is commonly used for oral thrush in infants. It comes as a suspension that you paint on the tongue and inside the cheeks. Fluconazole (A) is also an option, but in some cases, it's used as a single dose. However, Nystatin is more traditional for this condition in infants.

Wait, but is there a difference in how they're used? Fluconazole is a systemic antifungal, while Nystatin is topical. For a localized infection like thrush in a baby, a topical treatment like Nystatin is usually sufficient and preferred because it's safer for the baby and doesn't require systemic absorption.

So, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy would be Nystatin. That's option I.

The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for a 3-week-old male infant with white lesions in the mouth, indicative of oral thrush caused by Candida, is Nystatin. This antifungal is commonly used for localized fungal infections in infants and is applied topically.
