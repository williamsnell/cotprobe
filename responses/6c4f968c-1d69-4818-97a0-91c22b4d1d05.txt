Okay, so I need to figure out which of these fashion designers was born in the United States. The options are A to J, and I have to choose the correct one. Let me go through each option one by one and think about where each designer was born.

Starting with option A: Donna Karan. I remember that Donna Karan is an American designer. She was born in the US, I think in New York. So A is a possibility.

Option B: Gianni Versace. I'm pretty sure he was from Italy. Versace is an Italian brand, so he wasn't born in the US. So B is out.

C: Yves Saint Laurent. He was French, right? His designs were very influential in Paris. So C is not the answer.

D: Christian Dior. Another French designer, Dior is a big Parisian brand. So D was born in France, not the US.

E: Alexander McQueen. Hmm, I think he was British. He was a big name in London fashion. So E is not the answer.

F: Stella McCartney. She's also British, the daughter of Paul McCartney. So F is out.

G: Helmut Lang. I'm not too sure about him, but I think he's from Austria. He had a strong influence in the 90s with minimalistic designs. So G is not the US.

H: Karl Lagerfeld. He's a big name in fashion, known for Chanel and other brands. He was born in Germany, I believe, so H is not the answer.

I: Laura Ashley. She was British as well, her brand is known for feminine, floral prints. So I is out.

J: Coco Chanel. Definitely French. She founded the Chanel brand in France. So J is not the answer.

So going back, the only one left is A: Donna Karan, who was born in the US. I'm pretty confident about that. She started her own brand in the US and later expanded internationally.
