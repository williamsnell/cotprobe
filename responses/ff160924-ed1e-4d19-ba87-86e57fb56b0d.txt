Okay, so I've got this question about Reiman's critique of van den Haag's arguments in favor of the death penalty. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that both Reiman and van den Haag are philosophers who have written about ethics, particularly the morality of the death penalty. Van den Haag is known for defending capital punishment, arguing from a retributive perspective. He believes that the death penalty is justified because it's a just punishment for the most heinous crimes, like murder. His arguments often rely on the idea of "lex talionis," which is the principle of retribution—an eye for an eye.

Now, I need to recall what Reiman's stance is on van den Haag's arguments. Reiman is critical of retributive justifications for the death penalty. He argues that these justifications are problematic because they can lead to morally questionable outcomes. For example, he might say that retribution doesn't take into account the potential for rehabilitation or the idea that punishment should focus on deterrence or incapacitation rather than just retribution.

Looking at the options:

A: Are not based on logical reasoning. Hmm, I don't think that's right. Van den Haag's arguments are logical, even if Reiman disagrees with them.

B: Flawed due to lack of empirical evidence. That might be a point, but I think Reiman's criticism is more about the moral principles than empirical evidence. So maybe not B.

C: Contradict human rights. That's a possible angle, as the death penalty is often seen as violating human rights. But I'm not sure if that's the specific point Reiman makes against van den Haag.

D: Follow common sense. I don't think Reiman would agree with this. He's critical, so probably not D.

E: Based on biased principles. Maybe, but I'm not sure if that's the main issue Reiman points out.

F: Should be accepted. No, because Reiman is arguing against van den Haag, so F isn't right.

G: Prove that torture is impermissible. I don't think that's related here. Torture is another topic.

H: Based on retribution. Yes, van den Haag's arguments are based on retribution. But the question is about what Reiman says about van den Haag, so H is about van den Haag's position, not Reiman's critique.

I: Promote capital punishment. That's what van den Haag is doing, so I is about his position, not Reiman's critique.

J: Incompatible with the right to retaliation. Wait, the right to retaliation is similar to retribution. Van den Haag supports retribution, so J would say his arguments are incompatible with that right, which seems contradictory. But I'm not sure if that's what Reiman says.

Wait, Reiman's main point is that retributive arguments can't justify the death penalty because they can be extended to justify other heinous actions. For example, if retribution justifies killing a murderer, then why not kill someone who steals a wallet? He argues that retribution doesn't provide a morally acceptable basis because it can be used to justify any punishment, regardless of proportionality or other considerations. So he's saying that van den Haag's arguments are flawed because they can be used to support actions that are clearly wrong, thus making the principle of retribution problematic.

Looking back at the options, which one aligns with this? Option H says the arguments are based on retribution, which is true, but that's about van den Haag, not Reiman's critique. So Reiman is pointing out that van den Haag's reliance on retribution is a flaw because it leads to issues.

Wait, none of the options directly say that. Let me check each option again.

Option J: are incompatible with the right to retaliation. Wait, that seems contradictory. If van den Haag's arguments are based on retribution (the right to retaliate), then J would mean that his arguments don't align with that right, which can't be right because van den Haag supports it.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question is about what Reiman says about van den Haag's arguments. Reiman argues that van den Haag's retributive justification is flawed because it doesn't hold up when considering that the same principle could justify lesser harms, making it morally untenable. So Reiman's critique is that van den Haag's arguments are based on a flawed principle.

Looking at the options, H says "are based on the concept of retribution." That's true about van den Haag's arguments, but the question is about what Reiman says. So Reiman is pointing out that van den Haag's arguments are flawed because they rely on retribution, which is a problematic basis.

Wait, but the options are about what Reiman says. So the correct answer would be that Reiman says van den Haag's arguments are based on retribution (H), or that they are flawed because of that.

Wait, no. The options are about Reiman's critique. So Reiman's point is that van den Haag's arguments are based on a flawed principle—retribution. So the correct answer would be H: are based on the concept of retribution.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Reiman's argument is that van den Haag's retributive defense doesn't work because it can't account for why only murderers deserve death and not others for lesser crimes. So Reiman's critique is that van den Haag's arguments are based on retribution, which is a flawed justification. Therefore, the answer would be H: are based on the concept of retribution.

But wait, looking at the options, H is about the basis of the arguments, not the critique. The question is about what Reiman says about van den Haag's arguments. So Reiman is pointing out that van den Haag's arguments are based on retribution, which is a flawed principle because it can't be consistently applied without leading to moral absurdities.

So the correct answer is H.
</think>

According to Reiman, van den Haag's arguments in favor of the death penalty are based on the concept of retribution. Reiman critiques this by pointing out that retribution as a moral principle is flawed because it can be applied inconsistently, potentially justifying actions that are morally unacceptable. Therefore, the correct answer is:

H

The last character of the response is the letter H.

Answer:
H
