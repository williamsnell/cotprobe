Question:

On April 10, the owner of a golf course entered into an oral agreement with a gardener whereby the gardener promised to install all new sprinkler heads on the sprinkler system at the 18-hole golf course. In return, the owner promised to pay the gardener $2,400 upon completion of the job. Since a golf tournament was scheduled for the weekend of April 20 21, the gardener agreed to replace all the sprinkler heads no later than April 19. Before accepting the job, the gardener had inspected the golf course and determined that 240 sprinkler heads had to be replaced. By April 14, the gardener had installed 80 new sprinkler heads on the first six holes of the 18-hole golf course. That afternoon, however, the owner learned that the gardener had been adjudicated bankrupt on April 12, so he notified the gardener to discontinue the job. The next day, the owner hired a landscaper to complete the installation work at $8 per head. The landscaper installed the remaining 160 sprinkler heads and completed the work on April 19. Despite making reasonable efforts, the gardener was unable to find any gainful employment during the period. Also, the gardener's application for unemployment compensation was rejected at the same time. Which of the following statements, if found to be true, would provide the owner with legally justifiable grounds for discharging the gardener?

Options:

A: The gardener could not provide a warranty for the installation.
B: The gardener was not insured to carry out the task.
C: Half of the sprinkler heads installed by the gardener were determined to be defective, and the gardener refused to replace the sprinkler heads.
D: The owner found a cheaper alternative to complete the job.
E: The gardener was using subpar materials for the installation.
F: The gardener had been adjudicated bankrupt onApril 12.
G: The gardener had only completed 33 percent of the installation work when he was discharged.
H: The contract between the owner and the gardener was not in writing.
I: The gardener did not have a valid license to do the job.
J: The gardener failed to finish the job by April 19.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about when an owner can legally discharge a gardener based on an oral contract. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the facts: On April 10, the owner and gardener made an oral agreement. The gardener agreed to install new sprinkler heads by April 19, and the owner promised to pay $2,400 upon completion. By April 14, the gardener had installed 80 out of 240 needed. Then, the owner found out the gardener was bankrupt on April 12 and told him to stop. The next day, the owner hired someone else to finish the job for $8 per head.

The question is asking which statement, if true, would legally justify the owner discharging the gardener. The options are A through J.

I remember that in contract law, a party can discharge the other party if there's a breach of contract. So I need to see which of these options constitutes a breach.

Looking at each option:

A: Gardener couldn't provide a warranty. I'm not sure if a warranty is required here. The contract was about installation, not product warranty. So maybe not a breach.

B: Gardener wasn't insured. Again, unless the contract specified insurance, this might not be a breach. It's more about risk, but not sure.

C: Half the sprinkler heads were defective, and gardener refused to fix. That sounds like a breach because the work wasn't done properly, and he didn't fix it. If the work was defective, the owner could reject it, so this is a possible answer.

D: Owner found a cheaper alternative. Cheaper alternative doesn't justify breach unless there's a specific clause about cost. The owner can't just fire someone because they found a cheaper option; that's not a breach unless the contract allows for it.

E: Gardener used subpar materials. If the materials were inferior and didn't meet agreed standards, that's a breach. But the question is whether the owner can legally discharge based on that.

F: Gardener was bankrupt. Bankruptcy itself doesn't necessarily mean the gardener can't perform. The owner can't just fire someone because they're bankrupt unless there's a clause about financial stability, which isn't mentioned here.

G: Gardener completed 33% of the work. The owner fired him after 33%, but the contract didn't specify a completion timeline beyond April 19. The gardener was on track because 80 out of 240 is about a third, and time left was sufficient. So the owner can't just fire him for not completing yet.

H: Contract wasn't in writing. The contract was oral, but under the Statute of Frauds, certain contracts need to be in writing, but this is for $2,400, which might be under the threshold. However, the lack of writing doesn't make the contract unenforceable; it just makes it harder to prove. So this isn't a breach.

I: Gardener didn't have a license. If the job required a license and the gardener didn't have one, that's a breach. But the question is whether the owner can discharge him for that reason. It depends on whether the lack of license was material to the contract.

J: Gardener failed to finish by April 19. The deadline was April 19, and the gardener was fired on the 14th. But the gardener had completed a third of the work and had 5 days left. The owner fired him before the deadline, so J might not apply because the gardener didn't actually miss the deadline yet.

So the key points are whether the gardener's actions constituted a breach. The owner can discharge for breach, which includes failure to perform properly.

Option C: If half the installed sprinklers were defective and the gardener refused to fix them, that would be a clear breach. The owner can reject the defective work and find someone else.

Option E: Using subpar materials could be a breach if it affected the work's quality. But the question is about whether the owner can legally justify discharge. If the materials were subpar and caused defects, that could be a breach.

Option I: If the gardener lacked a necessary license, that could be a breach of contract if the license was required. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. The question doesn't specify that a license was needed, so maybe this isn't the best answer.

Between C, E, and I, I think C is the strongest because it's about defective work, which directly affects the owner's acceptance of the work. If the installed parts are defective, the owner can rightfully discharge the gardener and get the work done by someone else. 

So I think the correct answer is C.

The owner can legally discharge the gardener if there's a breach of contract. The strongest breach is when the gardener provided defective work and refused to fix it, justifying the owner's discharge.

Answer: C
