Question:

After being passed over for a promotion, an aeronautic engineer became a whistleblower. He contacted a government agency to state that the company for which he worked was submitting false safety reports on newly built aircraft. When the company learned that the engineer was leaking this information to the government agency, he was fired from his job. Afterward, the engineer sued the company for wrongful termination of employment. During the discovery stage of litigation, the engineer was deposed by the company's attorney. In his deposition, the engineer stated that the company submitted false safety reports to the government agency to cover up structural defects in its aircraft. A pilot was injured when one of the company'sairplanes he was piloting crashed. The pilot asserteda strict products liability tort against the company. At thal, the pilot seeks to introduce into evidence portions of the engineer's deposition from his wrongful termination lawsuit against the company. Assume that the engineer is unavailable to testify at trial. Upon objection by the company, the trial court judge should rule the engineer's deposition testimony

Options:

A: admissible as former testimony.
B: inadmissible as hearsay within the business records exception.
C: inadmissible due to the engineer's unavailability.
D: admissible as a statement against interest.
E: admissible as a vicarious admission.
F: inadmissible, because the company did not have the opportunity to cross-examine the engineer on the liability issue for which the statement is now being offered.
G: admissible as a dying declaration.
H: inadmissible because the engineer's deposition is biased.
I: inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.
J: admissible as a statement of personal or family history.

Okay, so I've got this question about evidence law, specifically dealing with hearsay exceptions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is a bit complex, but I'll try to untangle it. So, there's an aeronautic engineer who was passed over for a promotion and then became a whistleblower. He contacted a government agency about his company submitting false safety reports. The company found out and fired him, leading to a wrongful termination lawsuit. During the discovery phase of that lawsuit, the engineer was deposed, and he testified about the false safety reports to cover up structural defects. Now, a pilot was injured when one of the company's planes crashed, and the pilot is suing under strict products liability. The pilot wants to use parts of the engineer's deposition from the wrongful termination case as evidence. The engineer isn't available to testify now, so the deposition is being offered.

The question is about the admissibility of the engineer's deposition testimony in the pilot's case. The options are various hearsay exceptions and other rules.

First, I need to remember the rules about hearsay and exceptions. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Generally, it's inadmissible unless an exception applies.

In this case, the engineer's deposition is being offered by the pilot. The deposition was taken in a different lawsuit (the wrongful termination case), so it's not the same proceeding. The engineer is unavailable, so that affects certain exceptions.

Let's look at the options:

Option A: Admissible as former testimony. For former testimony, the statement must have been given under oath at a trial, hearing, or other proceeding, and the party against whom it's now offered had the opportunity to cross-examine. Here, it's a deposition, which is a type of proceeding. The company had the opportunity to cross-examine during the deposition. So, this might fit the former testimony exception. But wait, the engineer is unavailable now, so can former testimony still apply? I think it can because the key is that the statement was made under oath in a prior proceeding, and the opposing party had a chance to cross-examine. The unavailability doesn't affect this exception. So A might be a possibility.

Option B: Inadmissible as hearsay within the business records exception. Hmm, the business records exception applies to records kept in the regular course of business. But here, the deposition isn't a business record; it's testimony from a deposition. So B doesn't seem right.

Option C: Inadmissible due to engineer's unavailability. Wait, no, because some hearsay exceptions don't require the declarant to be available. For example, former testimony, statements against interest, etc. So C is incorrect because the exception might still apply even if the declarant is unavailable.

Option D: Admissible as a statement against interest. A statement against interest is when the declarant's statement was against their pecuniary or proprietary interest, or so far in conflict with their interest that a reasonable person would not have made it unless believing it true. Here, the engineer was blowing the whistle, which could have been against his interest at the time (maybe risking his job), but in the wrongful termination case, he was suing, so perhaps his statements were against the company's interest. Wait, but the statement is about the company's false reports, which would harm the company. So, if the engineer's statement is against the company's interest, but he's the declarant. Wait, statements against interest are about the declarant's own interest. So, if the engineer's statement harmed the company, that might not be against his own interest. Alternatively, if he's testifying against his former employer, perhaps the statement is against the company's interest, but that's not how the exception works. The exception is for the declarant's own interest. So I don't think this applies here. So D might not be correct.

Option E: Admissible as a vicarious admission. Vicarious admissions are statements by a party's agent or employee on a matter within their agency or employment, made during the existence of the relationship. But the engineer's statement was in a deposition, which was in a different case. I'm not sure if this would apply because it's not clear if the statement relates to a matter within his employment during the time he was employed. Also, the statement is being offered against the same company, but it's from a prior case. I'm not sure about E.

Option F: Inadmissible because the company didn't have the opportunity to cross-examine on the liability issue. Wait, in the deposition, the company did cross-examine the engineer. The key point is that the opportunity to cross-examine is about the specific issue for which the statement is now being offered. So, the statement in the deposition relates to the false reports, which is the same issue in the pilot's case. So the company had the chance to cross-examine on that issue. Therefore, F's reasoning is incorrect because they did have the opportunity. So F is not the right answer.

Option G: Admissible as a dying declaration. Dying declarations require that the declarant believed their death was imminent. There's nothing in the scenario indicating that the engineer was dying or believed he was about to die, so G doesn't apply.

Option H: Inadmissible because the deposition is biased. Bias can affect the weight of the evidence, but it doesn't make it inadmissible. The engineer's bias would be considered by the jury, but the statement's admissibility isn't barred because of bias. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception. If another exception applies, like former testimony, then I is wrong. But if none apply, then I would be correct. So I depends on whether another exception fits.

Option J: Admissible as a statement of personal or family history. This exception is for statements about the declarant's own family history or personal history. The engineer's statements are about the company's actions, not his own family or personal history, so J doesn't apply.

So, going back, the main contenders seem to be A (former testimony) and perhaps F or I. But as per F, the company did have the opportunity to cross-examine on the issue, so F is incorrect. Therefore, A might be the correct exception.

Wait, but in the pilot's case, the statement is being offered against the company. The engineer's deposition was in a wrongful termination case, which was against the same company. So, the statement was given in a prior proceeding, and the company had the chance to cross-examine. Therefore, it fits the former testimony exception under FRE 803(1). So the deposition would be admissible as former testimony.

Alternatively, could it be a statement against interest? If the engineer's statement harmed the company, which was his former employer, perhaps it's against the company's interest, but the statement against interest exception requires it to be against the declarant's own interest. Since the engineer was suing the company, perhaps his statement was against the company's interest, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's against his own. So D might not apply.

Therefore, the best option seems to be A: admissible as former testimony.
</think>

The engineer's deposition testimony from the wrongful termination case is admissible as former testimony under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(1). This exception applies because the deposition was given under oath in a prior proceeding (the wrongful termination lawsuit), and the company had the opportunity to cross-examine the engineer on the issue of false safety reports. The engineer's unavailability does not bar the use of former testimony. Other exceptions, such as statement against interest or vicarious admission, do not fit the facts as well. Therefore, the correct answer is:

A: admissible as former testimony.

Answer:
A
