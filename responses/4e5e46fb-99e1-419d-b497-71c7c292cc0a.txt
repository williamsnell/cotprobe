Okay, so I have this question about the WISC test and the percentage of people who score between 70 and 130. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with the WISC, but I think it's an intelligence test, right? Like the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. I remember that most standardized tests have scores that follow a normal distribution, which is the bell curve.

Wait, in a normal distribution, the mean is in the middle, and most people cluster around that. For many tests, including the WISC, the average score is set at 100, and the standard deviation is usually 15. So, 100 is the mean, and 15 is how much people vary from that average.

The question is asking about the percentage of people scoring between 70 and 130. Let me think: 70 is 30 points below 100, and 130 is 30 points above. Since each standard deviation is 15, 30 points is two standard deviations away from the mean. 

In a normal distribution, about 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation above and below the mean. That's the 68-95-99.7 rule. So, one SD is 85-115, which covers 68%. Two SDs would be 70-130 because 100 minus 30 is 70, and 100 plus 30 is 130. 

Wait, so two standard deviations from the mean cover about 95% of the population. Because 68% is one SD, and then adding another 13.5% on each side for the next SD brings it up to 95%. So, 95% of people score between 70 and 130 on the WISC.

Looking at the options, E is 95, D is 68, which is for one SD. So the correct answer should be E: 95.

The WISC test scores follow a normal distribution with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. The range of 70 to 130 represents two standard deviations from the mean. According to the 68-95-99.7 rule, 95% of the population falls within two standard deviations of the mean. Therefore, the correct answer is E: 95.

Answer: E
