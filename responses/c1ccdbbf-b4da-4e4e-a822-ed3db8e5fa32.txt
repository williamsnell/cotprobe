Okay, so I have this question about the three-box information processing model, and I need to figure out what the first place memories are stored. Hmm, I remember that the three-box model is also known as the Atkinson-Shiffrin model, right? It's a model of memory that breaks it down into three stages: sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory.

Wait, the question is asking about where memories are first stored. So, the first step in this model is sensory memory. Sensory memory is the initial stage where information from the environment is briefly stored. It's like when you see or hear something, and it's stored just long enough for you to process it further before it fades away.

Let me think about the options. The options given are A through J. Option B is sensory memory. So, that should be the first place. Short-term memory (A) comes after sensory memory, right? Because once the information is processed, it moves to short-term memory. Then, if it's rehearsed enough, it goes into long-term memory (J), which is the third stage.

Wait, but I should make sure I'm not confusing this with other models. I don't think the three-box model includes working memory or eidetic memory as the first step. Working memory is more like an active part of short-term memory, and eidetic memory is a type of visual memory, not the initial storage.

So, yeah, the first place is sensory memory. So the answer should be B.

The first place memories are stored in the three-box information processing model is sensory memory.
