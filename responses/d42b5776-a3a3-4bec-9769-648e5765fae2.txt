Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking. The problem says that f(x) is an invertible function, and it also tells me that f(2) equals f inverse of 2, and both of these are equal to 4. Then, I need to find the value of f(f(2)). The options are labeled from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step. First, I know that an invertible function means that there's another function, f inverse, such that when you apply f and then f inverse, you get back to where you started, right? So, for any x in the domain, f inverse of f(x) should be x, and vice versa.

The problem states that f(2) = f^{-1}(2) = 4. Wait, that's a bit confusing. So both f(2) and the inverse function evaluated at 2 equal 4. Let me write that down:

f(2) = 4
f^{-1}(2) = 4

Wait, that can't be right. Because if f^{-1}(2) is 4, that means that f(4) must be 2. Because by definition, f inverse of y is x if and only if f(x) = y. So if f^{-1}(2) =4, then f(4)=2.

So, from the problem, f(2)=4 and f(4)=2. That makes sense because f and f inverse are reflections over the line y=x. So, if f takes 2 to 4, then f inverse must take 4 back to 2, and f inverse of 2 would be 4 because f(4)=2.

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me clarify:

If f^{-1}(2)=4, that implies that f(4)=2. Because applying f to 4 gives me 2. So f(4)=2.

Similarly, f(2)=4. So f takes 2 to 4, and 4 back to 2. That makes sense because they're inverses.

Now, the question is asking for f(f(2)). Let's compute that step by step. First, f(2) is 4, as given. So f(f(2)) is f(4). And from earlier, we know that f(4)=2. So f(f(2)) equals 2.

Wait, but let me double-check that. So f(2) is 4, then applying f again to that result, which is 4, gives f(4). And since f(4)=2, the final result is 2.

Looking at the options, option I is 2. So the answer should be I.

Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So f(2)=4, and f(4)=2 because f inverse of 2 is 4, which means f(4)=2. Then f(f(2)) is f(4)=2. Yep, that seems right.

Wait, but let me think again. Sometimes when dealing with inverse functions, it's easy to get confused. So, f inverse of x is the value y such that f(y)=x. So f inverse of 2 is 4, meaning f(4)=2. And f(2)=4 as given. So yes, when I apply f to 2, I get 4, then apply f again to 4, I get 2. So f(f(2))=2, which is option I.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. So the correct answer should be I: 2.

The function f is invertible, and we know f(2) = 4 and f^{-1}(2) = 4, which implies f(4) = 2. Calculating f(f(2)) gives f(4) = 2. 

Answer: I
