Question:

The second cosmic velocity (or escape velocity) is the speed required by an object to escape the gravitational field of a celestial body with mass M and radius R. Which formula correctly calculates this velocity? (G: gravitational constant)

Options:

A: v = 2sqrt(GM/R)
B: v = sqrt(GM/2R)
C: v = sqrt(2GM/R)
D: v = sqrt(GM*R)
E: v = sqrt(GM/R)
F: v = sqrt(GM)
G: v = 2GM/R
H: v = sqrt(GM/2)
I: v = 2sqrt(2GM/R)
J: v = sqrt(2GM)

Okay, so I've got this physics question about the second cosmic velocity, which I think is also called the escape velocity. The question is asking which formula correctly calculates this velocity. I remember that escape velocity is the speed needed for an object to break free from a planet's gravitational pull without any further propulsion. 

Let me think, I've learned that the formula involves the gravitational constant G, the mass of the celestial body M, and the radius R. I'm pretty sure the escape velocity depends on these three factors. From what I recall, the formula involves a square root because velocity is a measure of speed, which is in square root terms when dealing with kinetic energy and potential energy equations.

I think the general approach is that the kinetic energy provided must equal the gravitational potential energy. So the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², and the gravitational potential energy is -GMm/R. Wait, because gravitational potential is negative, but when an object escapes, the kinetic energy must overcome the potential, so we set them equal in magnitude. So, (1/2)mv² = GMm/R. 

Wait, but when I set them equal, I can cancel the mass m from both sides. So that gives (1/2)v² = GM/R. Then, solving for v, I multiply both sides by 2, getting v² = 2GM/R. Taking the square root of both sides gives v = sqrt(2GM/R). 

Looking at the options, let's see. Option C is sqrt(2GM/R), which matches what I just derived. Let me double-check the other options to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Option A is 2 times sqrt(GM/R), which would be 2 times the square root of (GM/R). But wait, my calculation shows it's the square root of (2GM/R), not 2 times sqrt(GM/R). Let me compute that: 2 times sqrt(GM/R) would be [2]^2 * (GM/R) inside the square root, which is 4GM/R, but that's not what I have. So option A is incorrect.

Option E is sqrt(GM/R), which is just the regular sqrt without the 2, so that's not the escape velocity. Option J is sqrt(2GM), which misses the R in the denominator, so that can't be right because velocity depends on R. 

Wait, could I have mixed up the formula? Let me think again. The escape velocity is the speed needed so that the kinetic energy equals the gravitational potential energy. So yes, that gives v² = 2GM/R, so v is sqrt(2GM/R), which is option C. 

I'm pretty confident now that the correct answer is option C.

The second cosmic velocity, or escape velocity, is calculated using the formula derived from equating kinetic energy to gravitational potential energy. The correct formula is \( v = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}} \), which corresponds to option C.
