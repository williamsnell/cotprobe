Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Protocol 14 and its effects on the European Court of Human Rights. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking which statement is false. The options are A, B, C, D. Let's go through each one.

Option A: Protocol 14 changed the committee that hears admissibility cases from a three-judge formation to a one-judge formation. Wait, I remember that before Protocol 14, the admissibility of cases was decided by a committee of three judges. Protocol 14 did change this, right? I think it reduced the admissibility committee to a single judge to speed up the process. So A seems correct, making it not the false statement.

Option B: Protocol 14 added a new criterion for admissibility. Hmm, I'm not too sure. I know that Protocol 14 introduced some changes, including maybe new criteria. One thing I remember is that it made the admissibility decision faster and possibly added some conditions. So B could be true, meaning it's not the false one.

Option C: Protocol 14 abolished the Commission of Human Rights. Wait, the Commission of Human Rights was a body that existed before the Court, right? Protocol 14, I think, did away with that Commission because the Court took over its functions. So C is probably true, making it not the false statement.

Option D: Protocol 14 extended the judicial term of office for the European Court of Human Rights. I'm a bit hazy on this. I remember that Protocol 14 made changes to the Court's structure, like increasing the number of judges and maybe altering their terms. I think the term was extended from 9 years to 12 years. So D is correct, meaning it's not the false statement.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Protocol 14 came into force in 2010. One of its main changes was reducing the admissibility committee from three to one judge. It also abolished the Commission on Human Rights, as the Court was expanding. Additionally, Protocol 14 extended the term of judges from 9 to 12 years. So all of A, C, and D are correct statements. That leaves B as the one that might be false because I don't recall adding a new admissibility criterion. Or did it?

Wait, I think Protocol 14 introduced a new criterion related to the exhaustion of domestic remedies. Or maybe not a new one but clarified existing ones. Alternatively, perhaps it didn't add a new criterion but made other changes. If B says it added a new criterion, maybe that's incorrect. So the false statement would be B.

The false statement is B.

Answer: B
